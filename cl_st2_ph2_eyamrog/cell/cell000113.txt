Title: Ketogenic Diets Alter the Gut Microbiome Resulting in Decreased Intestinal Th17 Cells


Abstract: Summary

Very low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diets (KDs) induce a pronounced shift in metabolic fuel utilization that elevates circulating ketone bodies; however, the consequences of these compounds for host-microbiome interactions remain unknown. Here, we show that KDs alter the human and mouse gut microbiota in a manner distinct from high-fat diets (HFDs). Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of stool samples from an 8-week inpatient study revealed marked shifts in gut microbial community structure and function during the KD. Gradient diet experiments in mice confirmed the unique impact of KDs relative to HFDs with a reproducible depletion of bifidobacteria. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that ketone bodies selectively inhibited bifidobacterial growth. Finally, mono-colonizations and human microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice revealed that the KD-associated gut microbiota reduces the levels of intestinal pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. Together, these results highlight the importance of trans -kingdom chemical dialogs for mediating the host response to dietary interventions.

Section: Introduction

Very low carbohydrate (CHO), high-fat ketogenic diets (KDs) are used for multiple diseases, but their metabolic and immune consequences remain unclear ( Hall and Chung, 2018 20. Hall, K.D. ∙ Chung, S.T. Low-carbohydrate diets for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2018; 21 :308-312 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that KDs could act in part via the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota is highly sensitive to dietary intake ( Carmody et al., 2015 11. Carmody, R.N. ∙ Gerber, G.K. ∙ Luevano, Jr., J.M. ... Diet dominates host genotype in shaping the murine gut microbiota Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17 :72-84 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ) and plays a central role in coordinating host metabolism ( Cani et al., 2019 9. Cani, P.D. ∙ Van Hul, M. ∙ Lefort, C. ... Microbial regulation of organismal energy homeostasis Nat. Metab. 2019; 1 :34-46 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ) and immunity ( Honda and Littman, 2016 22. Honda, K. ∙ Littman, D.R. The microbiota in adaptive immune homeostasis and disease Nature. 2016; 535 :75-84 Crossref Scopus (1210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Work in rodents ( Cani et al., 2007; Olson et al., 2018 8.

David, L.A. ∙ Maurice, C.F. ∙ Carmody, R.N. ... Diet rapidly and reproducibly alters the human gut microbiome Nature. 2014; 505 :559-563 Crossref Scopus (6709) PubMed Google Scholar 33.

An integrated understanding of the rapid metabolic benefits of a carbohydrate-restricted diet on hepatic steatosis in humans Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :559-571 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ) shows that KDs alter the structure and function of the gut microbiota in states of health and disease. Yet, multiple fundamental questions remain unaddressed. In humans, the published studies have been confounded by other changes in caloric and macronutrient intake ( David et al., 2014; Mardinoglu et al., 2018 14. David, L.A. ∙ Maurice, C.F. ∙ Carmody, R.N. ... Diet rapidly and reproducibly alters the human gut microbiome Nature. 2014; 505 :559-563 Crossref Scopus (6709) PubMed Google Scholar 33.

An integrated understanding of the rapid metabolic benefits of a carbohydrate-restricted diet on hepatic steatosis in humans Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :559-571 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mechanisms through which KDs alter gut bacterial abundance are unknown as are the downstream consequences of these changes for host metabolism and immunity. Here, we dissect these questions through the combined use of controlled dietary interventions in human subjects and follow-on studies in mice. Together, our results emphasize the importance of considering the chemical dialogs between host and microbial cells to gain a more comprehensive view of the mechanistic links between diet and host physiology.

Section: Results

We conducted an inpatient crossover study in 17 adult overweight or class I obese non-diabetic men. Participants were first fed a baseline diet (BD) for 4 weeks (50% CHO, 15% protein, 35% fat) followed by a 4-week KD (5% CHO, 15% protein, 80% fat) ( Figure 1 A), resulting in elevated circulating plasma ketone bodies ( Figure 1 B). Daily stool samples were collected in the final week of each diet period. Subjects were in a similar state of mild negative energy balance during both stool collection periods ( Hall et al., 2016 21. Hall, K.D. ∙ Chen, K.Y. ∙ Guo, J. ... Energy expenditure and body composition changes after an isocaloric ketogenic diet in overweight and obese men Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2016; 104 :324-333 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S-seq) revealed significant shifts in the gut microbiota between the two diets ( Figures 1 C and S1 A; Table S1 ), including an altered relative abundance of the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes phyla ( Figure 1 D). 19 genera were significantly different with Bifidobacterium showing the greatest decrease on the KD ( Figure 1 E). Metagenomic sequencing of paired stool samples from the two diet arms confirmed the reduction of several bifidobacterial species on KD ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Table S2 ). Global profiling of the fecal metabolome by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) revealed a significant separation of fecal metabolite profiles between BD and KD stages ( Figures 1 F and S1 B; Table S3 ). We did not observe any significant differences in the short-chain fatty acid levels ( Figure 1 G) or bacterial load ( Figure 1 H) between the two diet arms.
High-fat diets (HFDs) reproducibly increase the Firmicutes at the expense of the Bacteroidetes ( Bisanz et al., 2019 4. Bisanz, J.E. ∙ Upadhyay, V. ∙ Turnbaugh, J.A. ... Meta-analysis reveals reproducible gut microbiome alterations in response to a high-fat diet Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 26 :265-272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet our results indicate that KDs have the opposite effect. To address this discrepancy, we fed C57BL/6J mice 3 matched diets for 3 weeks ( Figure 3 A): low-fat diet (LFD, 78/12/10 CHO/fat/protein), HFD (15/75/10), and KD (0/90/10). The KD raised plasma levels of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) compared to the other diets ( Figure 3 B). Mice fed the HFD and KD consumed more calories ( Figure 3 C) and gained more body weight ( Figure 3 D) compared to mice fed chow or LFD.
16S-seq revealed a significant effect of diet on the gut microbiota ( Figure 3 E). The HFD increased the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum at the expense of the Bacteroidetes; however, the KD reversed this trend ( Figure 3 F). The KD also decreased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria ( Figure 3 F). Comparing HFD and KD, we found 10 differentially abundant genera ( Figure 3 G) with Bifidobacterium showing the greatest decrease on the KD. Total colonization was comparable between diets ( Figure 3 H). The microbial shifts were stable and reproducible over 10 weeks of dietary intervention ( Figures S2 A–S2C) in animals at an independent mouse facility and with longer-term feeding ( Newman et al., 2017a 38. Newman, J.C. ∙ Covarrubias, A.J. ∙ Zhao, M. ... Ketogenic diet reduces midlife mortality and improves memory in aging mice Cell Metab. 2017; 26 :547-557 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ) over a period of up to 11 months ( Figures S2 H and S2I). Caloric intake, body weight, and adiposity were significantly higher on HFD and KD compared to LFD ( Figures S2 D–S2F). Mice in the KD group gained significantly less weight compared to HFD ( Figure S2 E) despite no significant differences in gonadal fat or liver weights ( Figures S2 F and S2G).
We replicated these findings with an alternative CHO source enriched for plant polysaccharides ( Figure S3 A; Table S4 ). Mice were sequentially fed these diets for 3 days each in order of decreasing dietary CHO. The gut microbiota shifted within a day following the chow-LFD and HFD-KD transitions ( Figure S3 B). Bacteroidetes decreased in response to CHO restriction with a corresponding increase in the Firmicutes ( Figure S3 C). Actinobacteria had a non-linear response to CHO that was also detectable at the genus level ( Figure S3 D). These results were consistent with a 3-week dietary intervention wherein mice were split into separate diets ( Figure S3 E) and experiments without added resistant starch ( Figure 3 F). The non-linear relationship between diet and the gut microbiota suggests that there may be a tipping point at which the microbiota responds differently to macronutrient intake.
To more precisely identify this tipping point we tested diets containing CHO levels ( Figure 4 A) between the original HFD (HFD75; 15% CHO) and KD (0% CHO): HFD85 (5/85/10 CHO/fat/protein) and HFD89 (1/89/10). Circulating ketone body levels increased as dietary CHO decreased ( Figure 4 B). There were no significant differences in caloric intake, body weight, or adiposity ( Figures 4 C–4E). The gut microbiota was significantly altered between HFD75/HFD85 and KD, but not between HFD89 and KD ( Figure 4 F). Bacteroidetes increased on all three diets compared to HFD75, with a progressive decrease in Actinobacteria with decreasing CHO ( Figure 4 G). We detected two differentially abundant genera between HFD89 and KD ( Figure 4 H). Bifidobacterium showed a progressive decline with decreasing CHO ( Figure 4 H), reflecting the overall Actinobacteria phylum ( Figure 4 G). Lactobacillus was significantly decreased on the KD ( Figure 4 H) despite no overall changes in the Firmicutes phylum ( Figure 4 G). These results suggest that partial induction of ketogenesis is sufficient to alter the gut microbiota despite the continued intake of CHO.
Multiple mechanisms could contribute to differences in the gut microbiota between the HFD and KD. Prior work showed that mucus foraging increases in mice fed polysaccharide-deficient diets ( Desai et al., 2016; Earle et al., 2015 15. Desai, M.S. ∙ Seekatz, A.M. ∙ Koropatkin, N.M. ... A dietary fiber-deprived gut microbiota degrades the colonic mucus barrier and enhances pathogen susceptibility Cell. 2016; 167 :1339-1353 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1714) PubMed Google Scholar 17. Earle, K.A. ∙ Billings, G. ∙ Sigal, M. ... Quantitative imaging of gut microbiota spatial organization Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :478-488 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, in our experiments, the mucus layer was maintained even in the absence of dietary CHO ( Figures S4 A–S4C), and Muc2-deficient mice lacking the major colonic mucin still exhibited similar gut microbiota shifts on the KD ( Figures S4 D–S4F). We also considered bile acids due to their role in fat emulsification; however, we did not observe a significant difference in the overall bile acid pool in human fecal samples ( Figure S5 A; Table S5 ) or mouse cecal contents ( Figure S5 B; Table S5 ) between diets. Finally, we focused on the ketone bodies that are indicative of increased lipid oxidation in response to CHO restriction. Although the liver is the primary ketogenic organ, intestinal epithelial cells are also capable of producing ketone bodies ( Puchalska and Crawford, 2017 45. Puchalska, P. ∙ Crawford, P.A. Multi-dimensional roles of ketone bodies in fuel metabolism, signaling, and therapeutics Cell Metab. 2017; 25 :262-284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (900) PubMed Google Scholar ), and βHB increases in intestinal tissue on a KD ( Tognini et al., 2017 55. Tognini, P. ∙ Murakami, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Distinct circadian signatures in liver and gut clocks revealed by ketogenic diet Cell Metab. 2017; 26 :523-538 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To investigate the impact of ketone bodies on the gut microbiota in the absence of CHO restriction, we supplemented the HFD with a synthetic ketone ester (KE) ( Figure 5 A), mimicking intestinal production of βHB. As a positive control, we also included the KD with or without KEs. In two independent experiments, KE supplementation significantly raised circulating levels of βHB over baseline on the HFD, albeit to a lower level than KD consumption for 3 weeks ( Figure 5 B). KE supplementation to either a HFD or KD significantly increased βHB concentrations in the intestinal lumen ( Figure 5 C). We also observed elevated βHB in intestinal tissue ( Figure 5 D). Caloric intake was similar across groups ( Figure 5 E); however, mice fed KEs gained significantly less body weight ( Figure 5 F). Mice fed the HFD-KE also gained significantly less adiposity than HFD controls ( Figure 5 G). 16S-seq revealed that KE supplementation significantly altered the gut microbiota on a HFD ( Figure 5 H). Three genera were consistently altered in response to dietary and pharmacological induction of ketosis ( Figure 5 I). Of these three, only Bifidobacterium had a significant negative correlation with βHB in the intestinal lumen ( Figure 5 J) and also decreased in abundance on the KD in both humans and mice ( Figures 1 E and 3 G).
βHB had similar impacts on the human gut microbiota. We incubated stool samples from 4 human donors fed a BD with three different concentrations of βHB (12.5, 25, and 50 mM) or vehicle controls. βHB inhibited the growth of these ex vivo communities in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5 K), and 16S-seq revealed broad changes in the microbial communities that were evident at the phylum level ( Figure 5 L) in the presence of 50 mM βHB, despite no overt growth ( Figure 5 K). We observed significantly lower abundance of Actinobacteria and increased Bacteroidetes comparing 50 mM βHB to vehicle control. We also found a total of 12 genera in the ex vivo communities that were significantly altered in the presence of βHB that included decreased abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus ( Figure 5 M). These results are consistent with our in vivo findings above where we observed the selective restriction of both genera in the gut microbial communities of mice fed the ketone ester and extend the relevance of our findings to the human gut microbiota.
βHB directly limits Bifidobacterium growth in vitro . We isolated a strain of Bifidobacterium adolescentis (strain BD1)—the most differentially abundant species of Bifidobacterium in our human cohort ( Figure 2 A)—from human stool samples. βHB inhibited the in vitro growth of B. adolescentis BD1 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure S6 A) and was bacteriostatic at the highest concentration tested ( Figure S6 B). Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that is chemically similar to βHB, produced similar growth-inhibitory effects ( Figure S6 C). Neutralization of βHB and butyrate prior to addition to the growth media abrogated their growth inhibitory effects ( Figures S6 A and S6C). Acidification of the growth media to match the pH of media at known concentrations of βHB recapitulated the inhibition of B. adolescentis growth ( Figure S6 D), suggesting that βHB prevents the in vitro growth of B. adolescentis through a pH-dependent mechanism.
To assess the specificity of βHB, we tested it against a panel of 35 gut bacterial isolates from 6 different phyla ( Figures S6 E and S6F) including 4 bifidobacterial strains isolated from our human cohort: 2 strains of Bifidobacterium adolescentis (strain BD1 and BD2), Bifidobacterium longum (strain BD3), and Bifidobacterium angulatum (strain BD4). For most isolates, the concentration required to prevent ≥90% growth (MIC 90 ) was between 25–50 mM, with the exception of isolates in the genera Eggerthella and Lactobacillus that were insensitive to growth inhibition by βHB at the highest concentration tested. We also detected growth-promoting effects of βHB on select bacteria ( Figure S6 E). Contrary to our in vivo ( Figure 5 I) and ex vivo ( Figure 5 M) studies, we did not detect a selective effect of βHB against Bifidobacterium . The Bacteroidetes tended to be more sensitive to growth inhibition by βHB relative to the other phyla ( Figure S6 F), in contrast to the increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes observed during KD consumption in humans ( Figure 1 D), mice ( Figures 3 F and 4 G), and ex vivo incubations ( Figure 5 L). Thus, the target specificity of βHB for Bifidobacterium observed in vivo could be driven by inter-species interactions and/or environmental factors.
Consistent with the latter hypothesis, the βHB concentrations used to achieve MIC 90 in bacterial monocultures are roughly the same order of magnitude as circulating βHB levels in humans—where consistent serum βHB levels above 2 mM are reached with a ketogenic diet ( Newman and Verdin, 2014 37. Newman, J.C. ∙ Verdin, E. Ketone bodies as signaling metabolites Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 25 :42-52 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (652) PubMed Google Scholar )—but exceed the estimated physiological range in the intestinal lumen. Our data suggest that the βHB concentration in bulk cecal contents of mice fed a ketogenic diet is ∼5 nmol/g ( Figure 5 C), which is multiple orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations tested in our in vitro assays (12.5–50 mM). Nevertheless, we found that the concentration of βHB in the intestinal tissue is roughly three orders of magnitude higher compared to luminal contents ( Figure 5 D), which could suggest that bacteria residing close to the intestinal epithelium may be exposed to relatively high local concentrations of βHB similar to the concentrations tested in the in vitro assays. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of βHB on bifidobacteria within the context of complex microbial communities and gastrointestinal physiology.
Human gut bifidobacteria, including B. adolescentis , induce pro-inflammatory intestinal Th17 cells in mono-colonized mice ( Tan et al., 2016 52. Tan, T.G. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ... Identifying species of symbiont bacteria from the human gut that, alone, can induce intestinal Th17 cells in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E8141-E8150 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mono-colonization of germ-free mice with B. adolescentis BD1 resulted in a significant increase in CD4 + interleukin (IL)-17a + (Th17) cells in the small (but not large) intestines of mice ( Figures 6 A and S7 A) that were fed a HFD over the course of the experiment. Consumption of a KD prevented the induction of intestinal Th17 cells in mice mono-colonized with B. adolescentis ( Figure 6 B), consistent with a significant decrease in B. adolescentis colonization in the ileum compared to HFD-fed mice ( Figure 6 C). CD4 + interferon (IFN)γ + (Th1) cell levels in the intestines were unaffected by B. adolescentis mono-colonization on either diet ( Figures 6 D and 6E), consistent with the previous report showing preferential induction of Th17 cells in the small intestine by B. adolescentis ( Tan et al., 2016 52. Tan, T.G. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ... Identifying species of symbiont bacteria from the human gut that, alone, can induce intestinal Th17 cells in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E8141-E8150 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data suggest that the KD, in part due to the host production of ketone bodies ( Figure 6 F), mediates the lack of intestinal Th17 induction in these mice by reducing colonization levels of B. adolescentis .
We next wanted to investigate if changes in Bifidobacterium relative abundance in the context of an intact human gut microbiota would translate to differences in intestinal Th17 cell accumulation. We inoculated germ-free mice with fecal microbiota from human donors collected during the BD or KD stages and the Bifidobacterium -depleted KD microbiota supplemented with B. adolescentis BD1 (KD+BA). Supplementation recapitulated Bifidobacterium abundance in the BD microbiota at both the phylum ( Figure 6 G) and genus ( Figure 6 H) levels. 16S-seq of fecal samples showed that distinct microbial communities were established between BD and both KD microbiota groups ( Figure 6 I). Bifidobacterium abundance was significantly lower in the KD group compared with either BD or KD+BA groups ( Figure 6 J). Mice that received the KD microbiota showed significantly lower intestinal Th17 frequency compared to either BD or KD+BA groups that were detectable on day 12 post-transplantation ( Figure 6 K). There were no significant differences in the Th1 cell population ( Figure 6 L). These results demonstrate that changes in the abundance of Bifidobacterium in complex human gut microbial communities can have a significant impact on intestinal Th17 accumulation.
Given that human fecal transplantation of BD versus KD-associated microbiota was sufficient to reveal differential accumulation of Th17 cells in the gut, we hypothesized that differences in intestinal Th17 frequency should also be detectable in our diet experiments with conventional mice. Consistent with this hypothesis, conventional mice fed a KD exhibited lower levels of Th17 cells in the small intestine (SI) compared to mice fed a HFD ( Figures 7 A and 7D). Similarly, mice fed the KE-supplemented HFD, which reduced Bifidobacterium abundance in the gut microbiota relative to HFD ( Figure 5 I), led to lower Th17 cell accumulation in the small intestines ( Figure 7 A). There were no significant differences in Th17 cell levels in the large intestines ( Figure 7 B) or spleen ( Figure 7 C). Immunophenotyping of other immune cell populations in the intestine and spleen ( Figure S7 B) did not reveal consistent changes comparing HFD-KE and KD to HFD; the observed immune changes were specific to small intestinal Th17 cells.
Differences in SI Th17 cell accumulation could also be observed with small changes in dietary CHO intake ( Figure 7 D). Intestinal Th17 frequency was significantly lower in mice fed KD compared to similar high-fat, low-CHO diets ( Figure 4 A), consistent with a significant decrease in Bifidobacterium abundance on the KD ( Figure 4 H). The observed intestinal Th17 cell levels are not directly proportional to Bifidobacterium abundance since we observed a significant decrease in intestinal Th17 cell frequency only on the KD ( Figure 7 D) despite the progressive decline in Bifidobacterium abundance with decreasing dietary CHO ( Figure 4 H). Furthermore, HFD89 (1% CHO) resulted in a significant increase in Th17 cells relative to HFD85 (5% CHO). These results suggest that there may be an abundance threshold that is required for bifidobacteria in the gut to induce Th17 cell responses in the lamina propria or that other host or microbial factors may contribute to the observed Th17 differences. There were no significant changes in other immune cells subsets including Th1 ( Figure 7 E) and Treg ( Figure 7 F) cell populations.
Given increasing evidence for immunological crosstalk between the gut and other tissue compartments ( Lee et al., 2018; Powell et al., 2017 30. Lee, Y.S. ∙ Wollam, J. ∙ Olefsky, J.M. An integrated view of immunometabolism Cell. 2018; 172 :22-40 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Powell, N. ∙ Walker, M.M. ∙ Talley, N.J. The mucosal immune system: master regulator of bidirectional gut-brain communications Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2017; 14 :143-159 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next asked if the observed differences in Th17 responses in the gut could be detected more systemically. Although we did not observe any differences in Th17 frequency in the spleen, we detected a significant drop in Th17 cell accumulation in visceral adipose tissue on both HFD89 and KD compared to the other diets ( Figure 7 G) with a similar pattern for the Th1 cell population ( Figure 7 H) and no differences in the Treg cell population ( Figure 7 I). These results complement recent findings that highlighted the effects of a ketogenic diet on immune cells in the visceral adipose tissue ( Goldberg et al., 2020 19. Goldberg, E.L. ∙ Shchukina, I. ∙ Asher, J.L. ... Ketogenesis activates metabolically protective γδ T cells in visceral adipose tissue Nat. Metab. 2020; 2 :50-61 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ) and raises the intriguing question of whether the observed changes in adipose Th17 cells are related to gut microbiome-induced changes in the intestinal immune environment or due to circulating βHB that may directly modulate immune cell function in the adipose tissue ( Puchalska and Crawford, 2017 45. Puchalska, P. ∙ Crawford, P.A. Multi-dimensional roles of ketone bodies in fuel metabolism, signaling, and therapeutics Cell Metab. 2017; 25 :262-284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (900) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings highlight how very low-CHO diets (0%–1%) are distinctive from low-CHO diets (5%–15%) in both gut microbial and immune responses.

Section: Discussion

Taken together, these results suggest that diet-induced changes in host metabolites alter the gut microbiota with downstream consequences for immune cells. The impact of the KD on the gut microbiota is distinctive from HFDs, due in part to the concomitant host production of ketone bodies. Inhibition of bifidobacterial growth by ketone bodies results in KD-associated decreases in intestinal Th17 cell levels and possibly also adipose tissues. Given the links between obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation ( Hotamisligil, 2017 23. Hotamisligil, G.S. Inflammation, metaflammation and immunometabolic disorders Nature. 2017; 542 :177-185 Crossref Scopus (1419) PubMed Google Scholar ), decreased levels of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells in both gut and adipose tissues on a KD may be a potential mechanism contributing to the greater efficacy of KD in improving some aspects of metabolic syndrome such as glycemic control ( Sainsbury et al., 2018; Saslow et al., 2017 47.

Aside from reported metabolic effects in clinical trials, KDs have been used as dietary treatment for intractable epilepsy since the 1920s and recent studies have found significantly positive outcomes with the use of KDs for treatment of refractory epilepsy in children and adults ( Kverneland et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018; Neal et al., 2008 28.

The ketogenic diet for the treatment of childhood epilepsy: a randomised controlled trial Lancet Neurol. 2008; 7 :500-506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (820) PubMed Google Scholar ) where anti-epileptic drugs have failed. However, the mechanisms mediating the efficacy of KDs as treatment for epilepsy remain unknown. A recent paper provided intriguing evidence for the role of the gut microbiota in mediating anti-seizure effects of KD in mouse models of refractory epilepsy ( Olson et al., 2018 41. Olson, C.A. ∙ Vuong, H.E. ∙ Yano, J.M. ... The gut microbiota mediates the anti-seizure effects of the ketogenic diet Cell. 2018; 173 :1728-1741 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (570) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, another recent paper showed increased proportion of circulating Th17 cells in patients with intractable epilepsy compared to control individuals that was partially reversed following KD consumption ( Ni et al., 2016 40. Ni, F.-F. ∙ Li, C.-R. ∙ Liao, J.-X. ... The effects of ketogenic diet on the Th17/Treg cells imbalance in patients with intractable childhood epilepsy Seizure. 2016; 38 :17-22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), highlighting the potential role of Th17 immune responses in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, and consistent with our data showing decreased Th17 cell frequency in both the gut and adipose tissues with KD consumption. These observations together provide the premise for future investigations into the potential role of Th17 immune responses as a mechanism underlying the efficacy of KD as a treatment for refractory epilepsy and potentially other diseases associated with increased Th17 activation such as autoimmune diseases. More research is required to better understand the long-term consequences of KDs in humans in both health and disease.
Our study highlights the role of the gut microbiota in mediating changes in intestinal Th17 cell responses to KD consumption. We focused on Bifidobacterium that had a reproducible decrease in abundance during KD consumption in both humans and mice and also with feeding of a synthetic KE in mice. Changes in Bifidobacterium abundance resulted in a significant alteration to intestinal Th17 cell populations. The impact of diet and the gut microbiota on Th17 cells may be beneficial or detrimental depending on the context, warranting comparative analyses of these complex interactions in the context of inflammatory diseases ( Tan et al., 2016 52.

USA. 2016; 113 :E8141-E8150 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ), defense against enteric pathogens ( Honda and Littman, 2016 22. Honda, K. ∙ Littman, D.R. The microbiota in adaptive immune homeostasis and disease Nature. 2016; 535 :75-84 Crossref Scopus (1210) PubMed Google Scholar ), and cancer immunotherapy ( Matson et al., 2018 34. Matson, V. ∙ Fessler, J. ∙ Bao, R. ... The commensal microbiome is associated with anti-PD-1 efficacy in metastatic melanoma patients Science. 2018; 359 :104-108 Crossref Scopus (1916) PubMed Google Scholar ), among others. Further investigation is also needed to explore the potential consequences of changes in other members of the gut microbiota observed with KD consumption. Lactobacillus were decreased in response to both the KD and KE supplementation in mice. In humans, both Fusobacteria and Escherichia were significantly enriched on the KD, which have both been implicated in predisposition to colorectal cancer ( Dalmasso et al., 2014; Kostic et al., 2013 13. Dalmasso, G. ∙ Cougnoux, A. ∙ Delmas, J. ... The bacterial genotoxin colibactin promotes colon tumor growth by modifying the tumor microenvironment Gut Microbes. 2014; 5 :675-680 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar 25. Kostic, A.D. ∙ Chun, E. ∙ Robertson, L. ... Fusobacterium nucleatum potentiates intestinal tumorigenesis and modulates the tumor-immune microenvironment Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14 :207-215 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1728) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results suggest that the short- and long-term impact of KDs on host health and disease likely depends upon a complex series of beneficial, neutral, and detrimental shifts in microbial ecology.
βHB has anti-inflammatory effects due to its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome ( Youm et al., 2015 59. Youm, Y.-H. ∙ Nguyen, K.Y. ∙ Grant, R.W. ... The ketone metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate blocks NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammatory disease Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :263-269 Crossref Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar ). Production of βHB during a KD could directly impact immune responses in addition to altering microbial mediated immunomodulation. Nevertheless, our current study provides evidence for a causal contribution of the gut microbiota in mediating the immune responses observed with KD consumption, as the transplantation of fecal microbiota from human donors fed KD versus a baseline diet into germ-free mice was sufficient to reveal differences in intestinal Th17 cell accumulation. Our data support the contribution of select gut bacterial changes, specifically Bifidobacterium , in modulating the intestinal Th17 cell population, consistent with previous work that showed that Bifidobacterium robustly induced intestinal Th17 cells ( Tan et al., 2016 52. Tan, T.G. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ... Identifying species of symbiont bacteria from the human gut that, alone, can induce intestinal Th17 cells in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E8141-E8150 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Supplementation of oral ketone esters to a HFD suggests that KD-induced microbiota shifts are mediated in part through host production of ketone bodies. In the context of the KD, both CHO restriction and βHB may contribute to the marked reductions in Bifidobacterium and are not mutually exclusive. We attempted to dissect the relative importance of CHO versus βHB though our fine dietary gradient experiments and KE supplementation. The decline in Bifidobacterium abundance was associated with the induction of ketogenesis and not the complete lack of CHO, providing additional support for the importance of ketone bodies. However, we also observed low Bifidobacterium levels in mice fed a low-fat, high-plant-polysaccharide chow diet, warranting additional studies.
Further investigations are also needed to dissect the relative contribution of hepatic versus intestinal ketogenesis to the observed gut microbial changes. Whereas local production of ketone bodies in the gut epithelium is likely to be more relevant to the gut microbiome, it is possible that elevations of circulating βHB from hepatic production during KD could also directly or indirectly shape the gut microbiota. Comparing the relative impact of intestinal versus hepatic ketogenesis on the gut microbiome might provide some insights into the physiological roles of ketone body production in the gut epithelium ( Cheng et al., 2019; Miyamoto et al., 2019 12. Cheng, C.-W. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Haber, A.L. ... Ketone body signaling mediates intestinal stem cell homeostasis and adaptation to diet Cell. 2019; 178 :1115-1131 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar 35.

USA. 2019; 116 :23813-23821 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Overall, this work extends important previous findings from our laboratory ( Carmody et al., 2015; David et al., 2014 11. Carmody, R.N. ∙ Gerber, G.K. ∙ Luevano, Jr., J.M. ...

Diet rapidly and reproducibly alters the human gut microbiome Nature. 2014; 505 :559-563 Crossref Scopus (6709) PubMed Google Scholar ) and others ( Tan et al., 2016 52. Tan, T.G. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ... Identifying species of symbiont bacteria from the human gut that, alone, can induce intestinal Th17 cells in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E8141-E8150 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing evidence that the impact of diet on the gut microbiota is not only translatable from animal models to humans, but also appears to play a causal role in mediating host immune responses to diet. Continued progress in elucidating the mechanistic basis for these observations could help inform more personalized approaches to utilize dietary interventions for the prevention and treatment of human disease.

The human study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NCT01967563), the Pennington Biomedical Research Center (2013-3-PBRC), Columbia University Medical Center (IRB-AAAL7113), and the Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes (IRB 493675). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Seventeen men between the ages of 18 - 50 years with body mass index between 25 - 35 kg/m 2 were admitted to metabolic wards (5 subjects at NIH, and 4 subjects at each of the three other sites) and consumed a baseline diet for 4 weeks followed by an isocaloric ketogenic diet for another 4 weeks. Details on the study design, subject recruitment, and diets have been previously reported ( Hall et al., 2016 21. Hall, K.D. ∙ Chen, K.Y. ∙ Guo, J. ... Energy expenditure and body composition changes after an isocaloric ketogenic diet in overweight and obese men Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2016; 104 :324-333 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fecal samples were collected daily in the final week of each diet stage and stored at −80°C. Participants underwent weekly fasting blood draws for assessment of ketosis. Plasma ketone levels in the final week of each diet stage is reported here.
All animal experiments were conducted under protocols (AN170378 and AN170098) approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. SPF or germ-free C57BL/6J mice were either born at UCSF or purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Germ-free and gnotobiotic mice were maintained within the UCSF Gnotobiotic Core Facility. Muc2 −/− mice on C57BL6/J background were generated as previously described ( Velcich et al., 2002 56. Velcich, A. ∙ Yang, W. ∙ Heyer, J. ... Colorectal cancer in mice genetically deficient in the mucin Muc2 Science. 2002; 295 :1726-1729 Crossref Scopus (765) PubMed Google Scholar ) and obtained from Eugene Chang (University of Chicago). Littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Unless otherwise noted, experiments were performed using wild-type C57BL/6J mice of both sexes between age 5 - 10 weeks at the start of experiment and were singly-housed during experiment.
All diets were provided ad libitum unless otherwise noted. Semi-purified diets were purchased from Envigo, and the ingredients used in these diets are listed in Table S4 . Standard chow diet (Lab Diet 5058) was used in the SPF facility, while standard autoclaved chow diet (Lab Diet 5021) was used in the gnotobiotic facility. All diets used for gnotobiotic experiments were either autoclaved or irradiated to ensure sterility.
All bacteria were cultured at 37°C in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) with an atmosphere composed of 2%–3% H 2 , 20% CO 2 , and the balance N 2 . Culture media was composed of brain heart infusion (BHI) media supplemented with L -cysteine-HCl (0.05%, w/v), resazurin (0.0001%, w/v), hemin (5 μg/mL) and Vitamin K (1 μg/mL), referred to herein as BHI+ and allowed to equilibrate in the anaerobic environment prior to use.
Selective isolation of bifidobacteria was carried out by plating diluted human fecal samples on TOS-propionate agar (Sigma) containing lithium-mupirocin supplement (Sigma), followed by incubation at 37°C overnight in an anaerobic Coy chamber. Single colonies were randomly selected and identified by Sanger sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene. A single colony identified as B. adolescentis (strain BD1) was inoculated into fresh BHI media and incubated anaerobically for 24 hours, mixed with autoclaved glycerol and stored in a cryovial at −80°C until further use.
The compounds used for bacterial growth curve assays are DL-β-Hydroxybutyric acid (Sigma 166898) and butyric acid (Sigma B103500). All compounds were dissolved in water and filter-sterilized to make 1M stock solutions. Two-fold serial dilutions of all compounds were freshly prepared prior to the start of growth curve assays. 10 μL of each dilution or BHI+ media (for growth controls) were added in triplicate to wells of 96-well plates containing 40 μL of BHI+ media. Fresh cultures of bacteria were cultivated in BHI+ media at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions, diluted to OD 0.001, then 50 μL of the diluted cultures were added to each well of 96-well plates except for sterile controls for which 50 μL of BHI+ media were added, making a total volume of 100 μL in each well. Plates were sealed with tape to minimize evaporation and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours with continuous shaking. Growth curves were acquired by tracking optical density (OD) at 600 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer (EON, BioTek Instruments), with measurements taken every 15 min.
An aliquot of frozen stool sample from each human donor was resuspended in 10 volumes (by weight) of BHI+ media in an anaerobic Coy chamber, vortexed for 1 min and left to settle for 5 min, and the clarified supernatant was then aliquoted for evaluation of ex vivo growth. 1:100 dilution of each fecal slurry was inoculated into BHI+ media containing different concentrations of DL-β-Hydroxybutyric acid (Sigma 166898) in quadruplicates per condition. Growth curves were acquired by measuring optical density (600 nm) every 15 min for 24 hours with continuous shaking.
B. adolescentis BD1 was inoculated into fresh BHI+ media and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours in an anaerobic Coy chamber. A single 200 μL aliquot of the B. adolescentis culture (1.3 × 10 8 cfu/mL) or sterile BHI+ media as vehicle control was administered by oral gavage into each germ-free mouse within its gnotobiotic isolator. Mice were switched from standard chow diet to either HFD or KD on the same day as colonization, and maintained on their respective diets during the 12-day experiment.
Four human donors were selected for fecal microbiota transplants, one from each study site. Frozen fecal samples from these human donors during BD and KD diet stages respectively were resuspended in 10 volumes (by weight) of BHI+ media in an anaerobic Coy chamber. Each diluted sample was vortexed for 1 min and left to settle for 5 min, and equal volumes of the clarified supernatants were pooled for gavage (one pool from four donor fecal samples collected during BD and a second pool containing another four samples collected from the same donors during KD). The KD microbiota pool was split into two volumes, and a third pool was prepared by spiking in fresh culture of B. adolescentis to one volume of the KD pool. A single 200 μL aliquot of each pooled sample was administered by oral gavage into each germ-free mouse within its gnotobiotic isolator. All mice were maintained on a standard autoclaved chow diet over the 12-day experiment.
Human stool samples were homogenized with bead beating for 10 min on a vortex fitted with tube holder (MoBio, 13000-V1), using beads of mixed size and material (Lysing Matrix E 2mL Tube, MP Biomedicals) and the lysis solution provided in the PowerSoil bacterial DNA extraction kit (MoBio), and DNA was subsequently purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
All other samples were homogenized with bead beating for 5 min (Mini-Beadbeater-96, BioSpec) using the ZR BashingBead lysis matrix containing 0.1 and 0.5 mm beads (ZR-96 BashingBead Lysis Rack, Zymo Research) and the lysis solution provided in the ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA Kit (Zymo Research). The samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 g and the supernatant was transferred to 1mL deep-well plates. The DNA was then purified using the ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA was extracted as described above. Quantification against a standard curve of purified genomic DNA from Escherichia coli was performed by quantitative PCR of the V6 region using BioRad iTaq Universal Probes Supermix in triplicate 10 μL reactions using 200 nM of the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TGGAGCATGTGGTTTAATTCGA-3′, 5′-TGCGGGACTTAACCCAACA-3′, 5′-[Cy5]CACGAGCTGACGACARCCATGCA[BHQ3] −3′. Reactions were performed on a BioRad CFX384 real-time thermocycler with the following cycle parameters: 95°C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 15 s.
DNA was isolated from human and mouse samples as described above. For human samples, 16S rRNA gene PCR was carried out using GoLay-barcoded 515F/806R primers ( Caporaso et al., 2012 10. Caporaso, J.G. ∙ Lauber, C.L. ∙ Walters, W.A. ... Ultra-high-throughput microbial community analysis on the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms ISME J. 2012; 6 :1621-1624 Crossref Scopus (6219) PubMed Google Scholar ) targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene according to the methods of the Earth Microbiome Project ( earthmicrobiome.org ). Amplicons were quantified with PicoGreen (Quant-It dsDNA, Life Technologies) and pooled at equimolar concentrations. For other samples, 16S rRNA gene PCR was carried out as per reference protocol and primers ( Gohl et al., 2016 18. Gohl, D.M. ∙ Vangay, P. ∙ Garbe, J. ... Systematic improvement of amplicon marker gene methods for increased accuracy in microbiome studies Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :942-949 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). Amplicons were pooled and normalized using the SequalPrep Normalization Plate Kit (Invitrogen). For both mouse and human samples, aliquots of the pools were then column (MinElute PCR Purification Kit, QIAGEN) and gel purified (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, QIAGEN). Libraries were then quantified and sequenced with a 600 cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit (250x250; Illumina) with ∼15% PhiX.
Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using QIIME before denoising and processing with DADA2 ( Callahan et al., 2016 7. Callahan, B.J. ∙ McMurdie, P.J. ∙ Rosen, M.J. ... DADA2: High-resolution sample inference from Illumina amplicon data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :581-583 Crossref Scopus (15680) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taxonomy was assigned using the DADA2 implementation of the RDP classifier ( Wang et al., 2007 58. Wang, Q. ∙ Garrity, G.M. ∙ Tiedje, J.M. ... Naive Bayesian classifier for rapid assignment of rRNA sequences into the new bacterial taxonomy Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73 :5261-5267 Crossref Scopus (15072) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the DADA2 formatted training sets for SILVA123 ( https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/assign.html ). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using FastTree ( Price et al., 2010 44. Price, M.N. ∙ Dehal, P.S. ∙ Arkin, A.P. FastTree 2--approximately maximum-likelihood trees for large alignments PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e9490 Crossref Scopus (8655) PubMed Google Scholar ) with midpoint rooting. Sequence variants were filtered such that they were present in more than one sample with at least a total of 10 reads. The PhILR Euclidean distance was calculated by first carrying out the phylogenetic isometric log ratio transformation (philr, PhILR) ( Silverman et al., 2017 51. Silverman, J.D. ∙ Washburne, A.D. ∙ Mukherjee, S. ... A phylogenetic transform enhances analysis of compositional microbiota data eLife. 2017; 6 :e21887 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by calculating the Euclidean distance (vegdist, Vegan) ( Dixon, 2003 16. Dixon, P. VEGAN, a package of R functions for community ecology J. Veg. Sci. 2003; 14 :927-930 Crossref Scopus (3539) Google Scholar ). Principal coordinates analysis was carried out using the pcoa function of APE ( Paradis et al., 2004 42. Paradis, E. ∙ Claude, J. ∙ Strimmer, K. APE: analyses of phylogenetics and evolution in R language Bioinformatics. 2004; 20 :289-290 Crossref Scopus (8959) PubMed Google Scholar ). ADONIS calculations were carried out (adonis, Vegan) with 999 replications on each distance metric. The Wald test in the DESeq2 package ( Love et al., 2014 32. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45394) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to analyze differential abundances on count data, using features that represented at least 0.05% of total sequencing reads. Centered log2-ratio (CLR) normalized abundances were calculated as A clr = [log 2 (A 1 /g a ), log 2 (A 2 /g a ),… log 2 (A n /g a ),], where A is a vector of read counts with a prior of 0.5 added and g a is the geometric mean of all values of A. Time-course analyses were carried out using linear mixed effects models (lmerTest, ( Kuznetsova et al., 2017 27. Kuznetsova, A. ∙ Brockhoff, P. ∙ Christensen, R. lmerTest Package: tests in linear mixed effects models J. Stat. Softw. 2017; 82 :1-26 Crossref Google Scholar )) using mouse as a random effect to account for repeated sampling across time. Corrections for multiple hypothesis testing to false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamin-Hochberg method ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 3. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Hochberg, Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol. 1995; 57 :289-300 Crossref Google Scholar ) were performed where applicable.
Fecal DNA from human donors was isolated as described above. Whole-genome shotgun libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). Paired ends of the libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Rapid Run mode) or NovaSeq 6000 platform. Raw Illumina reads underwent quality trimming and adaptor removal using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 5. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (36373) PubMed Google Scholar ) and host read removal by mapping to the human genome (GRCh38) with Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 29.

In brief, small intestinal and colonic tissues were splayed longitudinally with mucus removed by scraping then stored in complete RPMI (10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units per mL penicillin and streptomycin, β-mercaptoethanol, glutamate, sodium pyruvate, HEPES and non-essential amino acids). Supernatants were discarded after filtering through a 100 μM filter, and remaining tissue incubated in 1X HBSS (without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ) containing 5 mM EDTA (Promega) and 1 mM DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT) (Bioplus chemicals) for 45 min at 37°C on a shaker. Supernatants were filtered through a 100 μM filter and discarded, and remaining tissue was incubated for 45 min (colon) or 35 min (SI) at 37°C on a shaker in a solution containing 1X HBSS containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (GIBCO heat inactivated), 1 U/mL Dispase (Sigma), 0.5 mg/mL Collagenase VIII (Sigma), and 20 μg/mL DNaseI (Sigma). The supernatant was filtered over a 40 μm cell strainer into cold sterile 1X PBS. Cells were subjected to a Percoll (VWR) gradient (40%/80% [v/v] gradient) and spun at 2000 RPM for 20 min with no brake and no acceleration. Cells at the interface were collected, washed with PBS, and prepared for flow cytometry analysis.
Epididymal fat pads were dissected from the same side of mice following euthanasia and temporarily stored in 3 mL of cold Ham’s F-10 medium prior to digestion. The tissues were then finely minced with scissors and digested in 3 mL of 2X digestion buffer (2 mg/mL at 250U/mg Collagenase type I, Worthington, and 30 mg/mL bovine serum albumin in Ham’s F-10 medium) for 30 min at 37°C on a shaker, vortexing every 15 min. Cells were spun down at 1600 RPM for 7 min, resuspended in 10 mL of cold sterile 1X PBS, and filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer. Cells were spun down again, resuspended in PBS and prepared for flow cytometry analysis.
LPLs were isolated from the small intestinal and colonic lamina propria as described above. Fat lymphocytes were isolated as described above. Spleen cells were prepped through gentle mashing with a syringe plunger in 1 mL 1X PBS. Spleen cells were treated with 1X RBC Lysis Buffer (Biolegend) to lyse and remove red blood cells. For extracellular stains, surface staining was done in staining buffer: 1X HBSS (Corning) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Fisher Scientific), 2 mM EDTA (Invitrogen), and 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated) for 20 min at 4°C. Cells were then washed twice in staining buffer then assayed via flow cytometry. The following antibodies were used: anti-CD3 (17A2, Fisher Scientific), anti-CD4 (GK1.5, Biolegend), anti-CD8a (53.67, Biolegend), anti-CD44 (IM-7, VWR), anti-CD62L (MEL-14, Fisher Scientific), anti-CD11c (N418, Biolegend), anti-CD11b (M1/70, VWR), anti-MHCII (M5/114.15.2, Biolegend), anti-F4/80 (BM8, Biolegend), anti-LygC (HK1.4, Biolegend), anti-Ly6G (1A8, Biolegend), anti-B220 (RA3-6B2, Fisher Scientific), anti-IgD (11.26c.2a, VWR), anti-IgA (NA, Fisher Scientific), anti-IgM (RMM-1, VWR). For intracellular staining, cells were first stimulated with ionomycin (1000 ng/mL), PMA (50 ng/mL), and Golgi Plug (1 μL/sample) (BD Bioscience) overnight or 4-6 hours at 37°C. Alternatively, cells were stimulated with a cell stimulation cocktail (Fisher Scientific) containing PMA and ionomycin according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and Golgi plug was again added. Stimulated cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were surface stained with anti-CD3 (17A2, Invitrogen), anti-CD4 (GK1.5, Biolegend), washed, and then fixed/permeabilized in 100 μL Perm/Fix buffer (BD Bioscience). Cells were washed twice in Perm/Wash buffer (BD Bioscience) and then stained for intracellular cytokines: anti-Rorγt (B2D, Invitrogen), anti-IFNγ (XMG1.2, Millipore), anti-IL17a (ebio17B7, Invitrogen), anti-Foxp3 (150D, Biolegend). Cells were washed in Perm/Wash buffer twice and then re-suspended in staining buffer for flow cytometry analysis. Gating of cell populations was done using isotype and single stain controls. These data were collected with a BD LSR Fortessa and analyzed with FlowJo software (Version 10.6.1).
For measurements of circulating β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), blood was obtained from mice by cardiac puncture immediately following euthanasia in the day between 9am till noon. Blood was collected into collection tubes coated with K 2 -EDTA (Terumo T-MQK) or with serum separator (BD Microtainer 365978), centrifuged at 13,000 RPM for 10 min at 4°C to separate the plasma or serum, and frozen at −20°C until use. βHB levels were quantified using the LiquiColor β-Hydroxybutyrate colorimetric test (StanBio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Baseline absorbance of the sample-enzyme mixture prior to adding catalyst were subtracted from the final absorbance values in order to account for any sample hemolysis, with 2-3 replicates run per sample.
For measurements of βHB in intestinal contents and tissues, cecal content and colon tissue samples (25 mg) were extracted as previously described ( Tian et al., 2018, 2019 53. Tian, Y. ∙ Nichols, R.G. ∙ Roy, P. ... Prebiotic effects of white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) feeding on succinate and intestinal gluconeogenesis in C57BL/6 mice J. Funct. Foods. 2018; 45 :223-232 Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar 54. Tian, Y. ∙ Cai, J. ∙ Gui, W. ... Berberine directly affects the gut microbiota to promote intestinal farnesoid X receptor activation Drug Metab. Dispos. 2019; 47 :86-93 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, samples were extracted with 1 mL of ice-cold methanol [80% v/v, 0.1% formic acid] (for cecal content) or 0.5 mL of ice cold methanol [80% v/v] (for colon tissue), followed by homogenization. After centrifugation, the supernatants were dried in vacuum and reconstituted in 100 μL of methanol (3% v/v). Quantitative analysis was performed by the LC-MS system consisting of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 quaternary HPLC pump, a Dionex 3000 column compartment, a Dionex 3000 autosampler, and an Exactive plus orbitrap mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2.2 software (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Analytes were detected by multiple reaction monitoring and normalized by a 13C stable isotope labeled internal standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury, MA). The results were quantified using a standard curve with concentrations ranging from 0.1 μM to 50 μM.
The synthesis method for the hexanoyl hexyl β-hydroxybutyrate (C6x2-βHB) ester was developed by Scott Ulrich of Ithaca College (Ithaca, New York, USA) as previously described ( Newman et al., 2017b 39. Newman, J.C. ∙ Kroll, F. ∙ Ulrich, S. ... Ketogenic diet or BHB improves epileptiform spikes, memory, survival in Alzheimer’s model bioRxiv. 2017; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and the ester was then custom ordered in bulk from AK Scientific (Union City, CA). The βHB moiety of the ester is chiral, and the compound was synthesized as an enantiomeric mixture. Briefly, hexyl β-hydroxybutyrate was prepared by suspending sodium β-hydroxybutyrate in dry dimethylformamide and reacting with 1-bromohexane, followed by hexyl acyl chloride. The identity of the final product was confirmed by 1 H NMR and gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC/MS), with 97.5% purity on GC.
NMR spectroscopy was performed at 298K on a Bruker Avance III 600-MHz spectrometer configured with a 5 mm inverse cryogenic probe (Bruker Biospin, Germany) as previously described ( Cai et al., 2017 6. Cai, J. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Tian, Y. ... Orthogonal comparison of GC-MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy for short chain fatty acid quantitation Anal. Chem. 2017; 89 :7900-7906 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). 50 mg of fresh human feces were extracted with 1 mL of phosphate buffer (K 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.1 M, pH 7.4, 50% v/v D2O) containing 0.005% sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl) [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP-d 4 ) as a chemical shift reference (δ 0.00). Samples were freeze-thawed three times with liquid nitrogen and water bath for thorough extraction, then homogenized (6500 rpm, 1 cycle, 60 s) and centrifuged (11 180 g, 4°C, 10 min). The supernatants were transferred to a new 2 mL tube. Additional 600 μL of PBS was added to the pellets, followed by the same extraction procedure described above. Combined fecal extracts were centrifuged (11,180 g, 4°C, 10 min), 600 μL supernatants were transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube (Norell, Morganton, NC) for NMR spectroscopy analysis. A standard one-dimensional NOESY pulse sequence noesypr1d (recycle delay-90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquisition) is used with a 90 pulse length of approximately 10 s (−9.6 dbW) and 64 transients are recorded into 32k data points with a spectral width of 9.6 KHz.
NMR spectra were processed as previously described ( Cai et al., 2017 6. Cai, J. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Tian, Y. ... Orthogonal comparison of GC-MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy for short chain fatty acid quantitation Anal. Chem. 2017; 89 :7900-7906 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, all spectra quality was improved with topspin 3.0 (Bruker Biospin, Germany) for phase and baseline correction and chemical shift calibration. Then AMIX software (version: 3.9.14, Brucker Biospin, Germany) was used for bucketing (bucket width 0.004 ppm), interference signal removing (water and polyethylene glycol), and scaling (total intensity). The following multivariate data analysis was performed with SIMCA 13 (Umetrics, Sweden). Orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed with UV scaling, and the model was validated with a 7-fold cross validation method. R 2 X and Q 2 values generated from the method represent the predictive power and validity of the models, respectively.
Bile acids quantitation in mouse cecal content, serum and human feces was performed with an ACQUITY UPLC using a BEH C8 column (1,7 μm, 100 mm x 2.1 mm) coupled with a Xevo TQ-S mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source operating in negative mode (All Waters, Milford, MA) as previously described ( Sarafian et al., 2015 48. Sarafian, M.H. ∙ Lewis, M.R. ∙ Pechlivanis, A. ... Bile acid profiling and quantification in biofluids using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2015; 87 :9662-9670 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Selected ion monitoring (SIR) for non-conjugated bile acids and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for conjugated bile acids were used. 50 mg of cecal content/feces was pre-weighed, mixed with 1 mL of pre-cooled methanol containing 0.5 μM stable-isotope-labeled bile acids (internal standards) and 1.0 mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK), followed by thorough homogenization and centrifugation. Supernatant was transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis. 100 μL of serum was extracted by adding 200 μL pre-cooled methanol containing 0.5 μM internal standard bile acids. Following centrifugation, the supernatant of the extract was transferred to an autosampler vial for quantitation. Calibration curves of individual bile acids were drafted with bile acid standards for quantitation of the biological abundance of bile acids.
Targeted analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in human feces was performed with an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled with an Agilent 5975 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Santa Clara, CA) using a propyl esterification method as previously described ( Cai et al., 2017 6. Cai, J. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Tian, Y. ... Orthogonal comparison of GC-MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy for short chain fatty acid quantitation Anal. Chem. 2017; 89 :7900-7906 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). 50 mg of human fecal samples were pre-weighed, mixed with 1 mL of 0.005 M NaOH containing 10 μg/mL caproic acid-6,6,6-d3 (internal standard) and 1.0 mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK). The mixture was thoroughly homogenized and centrifuged (13200 g, 4°C, 20 min). 500 μL of supernatant was transferred to a 20 mL glass scintillation vial. 500 μL of 1-propanol/pyridine (v/v = 3/2) solvent was added into the vial, followed by a slow adding of an aliquot of 100 μL of esterification reagent propyl chloroformate. After a brief vortex of the mixture for 1 minute, samples were derivatized at 60°C for 1 hour. After the derivatization, samples were extracted with hexane in a two-step procedure (300 μL + 200 μL) as described ( Zheng et al., 2013 60. Zheng, X. ∙ Qiu, Y. ∙ Zhong, W. ... A targeted metabolomic protocol for short-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids Metabolomics. 2013; 9 :818-827 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, 300 μL of hexane was added to the sample, briefly vortexed and centrifuged (2000 g, 4°C, 5 min), and 300 μL of the upper layer was transferred to a glass autosampler vial. Second, an additional 200 μL of hexane was added to the sample, vortexed, centrifuged, and the 200 μL upper layer was transferred to the glass autosampler vial. A combination of 500 μL of extracts were obtained for GC-MS analysis. A calibration curve of each SCFA was generated with series dilution of the SCFA standard for absolute quantitation of the biological concentration of SCFAs in human feces samples.
Total RNA was isolated from colonic tissues using the Direct-zol-96 MagBead kit (Zymo Research) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For qPCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (BioRad), and qPCR was performed using a commercially available TaqMan Gene Expression Assay for Muc2 (Assay ID: Mm01276694_g1) with iTaq Universal Probes Supermix (BioRad) on a BioRad CFX384 real-time thermocycler. Samples were run in triplicates and normalized to the B2m housekeeping gene (Taqman Gene Expression Assay ID: Mm00437762_m1).
Sections of the distal colon, closest to the rectum and containing a fecal pellet, were collected from mice following euthanasia and placed in cassettes. Tissues were fixed in methacarn solution and processed as previously described ( Earle et al., 2015; Johansson and Hansson, 2012 17. Earle, K.A. ∙ Billings, G. ∙ Sigal, M. ...

Colon samples within cassettes were then submerged in melted paraffin at 68°C for 1 hr, removed, and kept at room temperature until sectioning. Paraffin blocks were cut into 4-μm-thick sections and deparaffinized for FISH staining.
FISH was performed as previously described ( Earle et al., 2015; Johansson and Hansson, 2012 17. Earle, K.A. ∙ Billings, G. ∙ Sigal, M. ...

Briefly, deparaffinized sections were incubated with the universal bacterial EUB338 probe ( Amann et al., 1990 1. Amann, R.I. ∙ Binder, B.J. ∙ Olson, R.J. ... Combination of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes with flow cytometry for analyzing mixed microbial populations Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56 :1919-1925 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) diluted to 10ng/μL in hybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% formamide) at 50°C for 20 min in the dark and washed three times in PBS. Samples were then incubated with 10 μg/mL DAPI (EMD Millipore) and 40 μg/mL FITC-UEA1 (Sigma) in the dark for 1 hr at 4°C, washed three times in PBS, allowed to dry, and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs).
Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 880 or Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Samples were imaged with a 63x oil-immersion objective. For quantification of mucus thickness, images were acquired with a frame size of 1912 X 1912 and 16-bit depth on the Zeiss LSM 880 microscope, with tile scans acquired using a mechanical stage and overlapping images (3 × 5) stitched using the ZEN Imaging Software (black edition). Mucus thickness was then quantified using the analysis platform BacSpace ( Earle et al., 2015 17. Earle, K.A. ∙ Billings, G. ∙ Sigal, M. ... Quantitative imaging of gut microbiota spatial organization Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :478-488 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Where applicable, statistical analysis was performed using either R version 3.5 or GraphPad Prism 8. ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis was used for parametric analysis of variance between groups, and two-tailed paired Student’s t test or unpaired Welch’s t test was used for pairwise comparisons. The Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s test was used for non-parametric analysis of variance between groups, and a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pairwise comparisons. For longitudinal data analyses, linear mixed effects models were performed using lmerTest ( Kuznetsova et al., 2017 27. Kuznetsova, A. ∙ Brockhoff, P. ∙ Christensen, R. lmerTest Package: tests in linear mixed effects models J. Stat. Softw. 2017; 82 :1-26 Crossref Google Scholar ) with multiple testing corrections via the ghlt function of multcomp using TukeyHSD. Analysis and data visualization of microbial populations were carried out in R as described above. Data are presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise noted.
