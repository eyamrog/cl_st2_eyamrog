Title: Targeted suppression of human IBD-associated gut microbiota commensals by phage consortia for treatment of intestinal inflammation


Abstract: Summary

Human gut commensals are increasingly suggested to impact non-communicable diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), yet their targeted suppression remains a daunting unmet challenge. In four geographically distinct IBD cohorts (n = 537), we identify a clade of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains, featuring a unique antibiotics resistance and mobilome signature, to be strongly associated with disease exacerbation and severity. Transfer of clinical IBD-associated Kp strains into colitis-prone, germ-free, and colonized mice enhances intestinal inflammation. Stepwise generation of a lytic five-phage combination, targeting sensitive and resistant IBD-associated Kp clade members through distinct mechanisms, enables effective Kp suppression in colitis-prone mice, driving an attenuated inflammation and disease severity. Proof-of-concept assessment of Kp-targeting phages in an artificial human gut and in healthy volunteers demonstrates gastric acid-dependent phage resilience, safety, and viability in the lower gut. Collectively, we demonstrate the feasibility of orally administered combination phage therapy in avoiding resistance, while effectively inhibiting non-communicable disease-contributing pathobionts.

Section: Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD), and indeterminate colitis, are auto-inflammatory disorders characterized by an uncontrolled innate and adaptive immune response leading to sustained tissue damage ( Kaplan 2015 52. Kaplan, G.G. The global burden of IBD: from 2015 to 2025 Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2015; 12 :720-727 Crossref Scopus (1253) PubMed Google Scholar ). The gut microbiota contributes to the aberrant immune response in genetically IBD-susceptible patients through multiple mechanisms ( Neurath 2020 77. Neurath, M.F.

J. 2018; 5 :e97 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Sustained, targeted elimination of IBD-associated-pathobionts, without impacting the surrounding microbial ecosystem, remains a daunting and unmet challenge.
Bacteriophages are ubiquitous self-replicating viruses that infect bacteria with a high host specificity, mediated by the interaction with cognate bacterial receptors ( Nobrega et al., 2018 80.

In a constant “arms race,” bacteria have evolved multiple anti-phage defense mechanisms, including restriction endonucleases ( Labrie et al., 2010 60. Labrie, S.J. ∙ Samson, J.E. ∙ Moineau, S. Bacteriophage resistance mechanisms Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :317-327 Crossref Scopus (1465) PubMed Google Scholar ), CRISPR ( Barrangou et al., 2007 10.

However, long-term utilization of oral phage treatment as a means of sustained suppression of gastrointestinal pathobionts associated with non-communicable diseases remains elusive to date.

Section: Results

In all featured experiments, exact statistical values ( STAR Methods ) are provided in Table S1 . We began our exploration by analyzing the gut microbiota composition of four cross-sectional, geographically distinct IBD cohorts from France, Israel, USA, and Germany (n = 537, Figure S1 A). Controls consisted of unrelated healthy individuals. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of stool samples derived from the four cohorts revealed a lower microbial richness in CD and UC patients (p value < 0.0001, Figure 1 A), as previously described ( Ni et al., 2017 78. Ni, J. ∙ Wu, G.D. ∙ Albenberg, L. ... Gut microbiota and IBD: causation or correlation? Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2017; 14 :573-584 Crossref Scopus (776) PubMed Google Scholar ). Globally, stool microbiota composition significantly differed between UC and CD patients and between either UC or CD and healthy controls (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA] p value = 0.001, Figure 1 B). Furthermore, in each individual cohort, significant global differences between IBD patients and healthy controls were noted, as quantified by Bray-Curtis dissimilarities ( Figure 1 C). Differential abundance analysis identified five bacterial species that were significantly enriched in both CD and UC patients compared to controls in all geographically diverse cohorts ( Figure 1 D; Table S2 ). Among these five species, Kp and E. coli were also significantly enriched in CD patients sampled during flare-up compared to those sampled during remission, whereas only Kp was not significantly depleted in UC patients during flare-up ( Figure 1 D). For these reasons, we chose to focus on Kp, collectively present in 39.28% of IBD patients in our cohorts, as a putative IBD-contributing pathobiont for the remainder of the study.
The French cohort featured 42 CD patients, 44 UC patients, and 25 healthy controls ( Figure S1 A). Kp was overrepresented in both CD and UC patients compared to controls ( Figure 1 E and Table S2 ). An Israeli cohort, composed of 54 CD patients, 32 UC patients, and 30 healthy controls ( Figure S1 A) corroborated the above findings, showing a higher abundance of Kp in CD and UC patients compared to healthy controls ( Figure 1 F; Table S2 ). Likewise, a third USA cohort included 24 CD patients, 44 UC patients, and 51 healthy controls ( Figure S1 A) and featured an over-representation of Kp in each IBD subset ( Figure 1 G and Table S2 ). A fourth German cohort, composed of 68 UC patients and 123 healthy controls ( Figure S1 A), similarly demonstrated an expansion of Kp in UC patients compared to healthy controls ( Figure 1 H; Table S2 ). Collectively in our cohorts, Kp abundance was not correlated with age in healthy individuals or in CD or UC patients ( Figure S1 B).
In three of the cohorts (France, Israel, USA), IBD patients were further classified to be in a disease flare-up or in remission based on clinical symptoms ( STAR Methods ) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels ( Figure 1 I). Lower microbial richness was observed in CD patients, regardless of flare or remission states, as compared to healthy controls (p value < 0.0001, Figure S1 C). In both CD and UC, stool microbial community structure globally differed between flaring patients upon comparison to respective remission controls or to healthy subjects (PERMANOVA p value = 0.003, Figure 1 J). Global community structure in CD flare-up patients was associated with an enriched Kp abundance, compared to CD patients in remission ( Figures 1 K and S1 D; Table S2 ). Interestingly, in these three cohorts treatment of IBD patients with multiple immune-modulatory therapies ( Xu et al., 2018 117. Xu, J. ∙ Chen, N. ∙ Wu, Z. ... 5-Aminosalicylic Acid Alters the Gut Bacterial Microbiota in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9 :1274 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schirmer et al., 2018 96. Schirmer, M. ∙ Denson, L. ∙ Vlamakis, H. ... Compositional and temporal changes in the gut microbiome of pediatric ulcerative colitis patients are linked to disease course Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :600-610.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ) was associated with Kp depletion, possibly driven by ameliorated disease severity in treated patients ( Figures S2 A–S2E; Table S2 ). To further generalize our findings, we re-analyzed data from a published USA-based IBD cohort ( Lloyd-Price et al., 2019 68. Lloyd-Price, J. ∙ Arze, C. ∙ Ananthakrishnan, A.N. ... Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases Nature. 2019; 569 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (1014) PubMed Google Scholar ) and identified Kp abundance to be significantly enriched in IBD patients compared to controls, similar to our results ( Figure S2 F; Table S2 ). In this study, dietary patterns, which possibly influence gut microbiota configurations ( Kolodziejczyk et al., 2019 57. Kolodziejczyk, A.A. ∙ Zheng, D. ∙ Elinav, E. Diet-microbiota interactions and personalized nutrition Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :742-753 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ), were neither linked to IBD ( Figure S2 G) nor associated with differential Kp abundance ( Figure S2 H), suggesting that Kp-IBD disease association is independent of dietary confounders.
As numerous disease-associated pathobionts are suggested to feature a marked antibiotics resistance limiting eradication ( Ayres et al., 2012 8. Ayres, J.S. ∙ Trinidad, N.J. ∙ Vance, R.E.

Med. 2012; 18 :799-806 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ; Soares et al., 2017 100. Soares, F.S. ∙ Amaral, F.C. ∙ Silva, N.L.C. ...

To this aim, we collectively quantified the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in patients and controls from all cohorts. We noted an expansion of the resistome alpha diversity (p value < 0.0001, Figure 2 A) and differential resistome composition (PERMANOVA p value = 0.029, Figure 2 B) in CD and UC patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, Kp abundance was significantly correlated with the global resistome profile (PCoA 1 ∼Kp, p value < 0.0001, R 2 = 0.3405, Figure 2 C). Similarly, we explored the landscape of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) associated with the fecal microbiota in all individuals. We observed a higher alpha diversity (p value < 0.0001, Figure 2 D) and a differential mobilome profile in IBD subtypes compared to controls (PERMANOVA p value = 0.001, Figure 2 E), which was likewise correlated with Kp (PCoA 2 ∼Kp, p value < 0.0001, R 2 = 0.408, Figure 2 F). Correlative analysis of genetic elements and bacterial family abundances identified enrichment of significant associations between Enterobacteriaceae (the Kp family) and differential ARGs and MGEs over-represented in disease, some of which significantly correlated with Kp ( Figure 2 G; Table S3 ).
Functionally, the fecal microbiota of IBD patients clustered differently than that of healthy controls (Biocyc pathways, PERMANOVA p value = 0.001, Figure 2 H), a feature that was also associated with the differential abundance of Kp (PCoA 1 ∼Kp, p value < 0.0001, R 2 = 0.3529, Figure 2 I). Multiple pathways were noted to be significantly different in CD and UC patients compared to healthy participants ( Figure S2 I; Table S4 ), including, as an example, menaquinol biosynthesis, which is suggested to play an important role in the virulence and survival of some pathogens ( Li et al., 2018 65. Li, Z. ∙ Quan, G. ∙ Jiang, X. ... Effects of metabolites derived from gut microbiota and hosts on pathogens Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2018; 8 :314 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, among Kp strains, several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) terms related to amino acids, nucleotide, mannose, and fructose metabolism were more abundant in each IBD subtype compared to controls ( Figure 2 J; Table S4 ). For example, mannose-specific components, required by different phages for DNA injection into the inner membrane ( Liu et al., 2019 67. Liu, X. ∙ Zeng, J. ∙ Huang, K. ... Structure of the mannose transporter of the bacterial phosphotransferase system Cell Res. 2019; 29 :680-682 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), were significantly over-represented in Kp genomes of IBD patients compared to controls.
Collectively, a significant fecal enrichment of Kp was observed in all four geographically independent IBD cohorts and was linked to a disease flare-up state. An IBD-associated expansion in the repertoire of ARGs and MGEs was driven by expansion of Kp abundance, among other Enterobacteriaceae species, which may likely lead to resistance to antibiotic treatment manifested by these IBD-associated pathobionts.
Distinct Kp strains, such as Kp-2H7, were previously suggested to elicit a pro-inflammatory response in the murine gut ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives TH1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). To elucidate possible Kp strains associated with human IBD across our cohorts, we initially analyzed our read distribution along the Kp bacterial genome. In most individuals featuring a Kp signal, metagenomic reads were aligned to the entire genome ( Figure S3 A). However, in some participants, the Kp signal was detected only in distinct recurrent regions ( Figure S3 B). Combining Kp reads from all participants of each cohort, we detected several significantly enriched regions of high sequence homology with other species ( E. coli or other Klebsiella species, Figure S3 C) that were generating an overestimation of Kp relative abundance. Aiming to correct for this bias, we refined the number of Kp reads ( Figure S3 D; Table S5 ) and found that Kp was still significantly expanded in IBD in all geographic cohorts ( Figures 3 A and S4 A). We next quantified the relative abundance of specific Kp strains present in healthy individuals and IBD patients. To this aim, we downloaded the genomic sequence of 356 Kp strains from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, including the Kp-2H7 sequence ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives TH1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ); constructed single-nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles; and defined 89 representative Kp strains. Using these profiles, we determined the number and identity of the coexisting representative strains, as well as their relative abundances in each metagenomic sample with a minimum number of Kp reads ( STAR Methods ). Using this method, we identified the Kp KSB1_4E (GenBank: GCA_002754835.1) strain to be significantly more abundant in all IBD subtypes and enriched during a flare, compared to a remission state ( Figure 3 B). Interestingly, this strain clustered together in the same clade with the previously discovered Kp-2H7 strain, hence termed an “IBD-associated,” or Kp2, clade ( Figure 3 C). This clade is associated with the functional multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) profile ST323, based on the detection of seven gene alleles present in all the strains of this clade (PubMLST: ST-323).
To further assess the causal impact of the identified IBD-associated clade, 598 clinical Kp strains were isolated from the stool samples of IBD patients derived from the Israeli cohort. These were functionally classified by MLST ( Figure S4 B) as either Kp2 strains (ST323) or non-Kp2 strains. Nineteen final Kp strains (10 Kp2 and 9 non-Kp2 strains) were selected for further experiments ( Figure S4 C). Higher presence of Kp2 strains was confirmed by a strain-specific qPCR in CD and UC patients of the Israeli cohort ( Figure S4 D).
To test the Kp2 clade involvement in IBD development, we orally inoculated multiple clinical non-Kp2 and Kp2 isolates, obtained by stool samples of Israeli participants, into germ-free (GF) wild-type (WT) mice at two different facilities (Keio University School of Medicine [KUSM]) and Weizmann Institute of Science [WIS] ( Figure 4 A) and tested their ability to colonize and elicit a pro-inflammatory response ( Figures 4 B, S5 , S6 A, and S6B). Indeed, Kp strains were similarly able to colonize the gut ( Figure S6 A) and differentially induced a pro-inflammatory response in the colon, mainly consisting of a T helper 1 (Th1) response ( Figures 4 B and S6 B). As previously described for the Kp-2H7 strain ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives TH1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ), no difference in colonic mucosal lamina propria interleukin (IL)-17 + CD4 + T cell abundance among strains was observed ( Figure S6 C), while all the tested clinical Kp isolates featured a significant increase in interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-17 co-expression as compared to the reference non-Kp2 strain K. pneumoniae KTCT 2242 ( Figure 4 C). Likewise, augmented numbers of CD4 + T cells labeled for both IL-17 and RORγt, the master transcription factor of Th17 cells ( Yang et al., 2016 118. Yang, B.H. ∙ Hagemann, S. ∙ Mamareli, P. ... Foxp3(+) T cells expressing RORγt represent a stable regulatory T-cell effector lineage with enhanced suppressive capacity during intestinal inflammation Mucosal Immunol. 2016; 9 :444-457 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ), were observed in mice infected with Kp isolates ( Figure S6 D). Moreover, Kp-2H7 reduced the percentage of colonic mucosal lamina propria RORγt + Foxp3 + T cells as compared to the reference non-Kp2 strain ( Figure S6 E), while no differences were observed with respect to RORγt − Foxp3 + T cells when compared to the reference non-Kp2 strain ( Figure S6 F).
To further delineate the strain-specific Kp2-induced pro-inflammatory response ( Figure 4 D), GF Vert-X IL-10-eGFP-reporter mice ( Mishima et al., 2015 75. Mishima, Y. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Hansen, J.J. ... Resident bacteria-stimulated IL-10-secreting B cells ameliorate T cell-mediated colitis by inducing Tr-1 cells that require IL-27-signaling Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol.

B-Cell Commitment to IL-10 Production: The VertX Il10egfp Mouse Methods Mol. Biol. 2021; 2270 :341-358 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ) were colonized with a consortium of 11 Kp clinical strains for 2 or 4 weeks. Following sacrifice of the mice, splenocytes were ex vivo restimulated with individual Kp bacterial lysates, and IL-10 and IFN-γ secretion were measured by ELISA. Additionally, IL-10 expression was examined by flow cytometry. Several of the tested Kp strains, including Kp-2H7, induced significantly higher IFN-γ secretion compared to E. coli ( Figure S6 G). Importantly, all the clinical Kp2 isolates induced a lower IL-10 expression and secretion ( Figures 4 E and S6 H–S6I) in comparison to lysates from splenocytes activated by non-Kp2 clinical strains, which induced a higher IL-10 expression compared to E. coli . Overall, a pro-inflammatory response, determined as a higher IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio, was observed in splenocytes stimulated with Kp2 strains (after 2 or 4 weeks, Figure S6 J and 4 F, respectively). Further strain- and species-specific Kp impacts on local and systemic immune responses merit further studies. To further assess the in vivo pro-inflammatory response induced by the clinical Kp2 strains, GF IL-10 −/− mice were colonized with the pooled 11 Kp strain consortium. Indeed, an increase in fecal lipocalin, a non-invasive marker for intestinal inflammation, was observed after 2 weeks of colonization ( Figure S6 K). Based on these results, we selected three Kp2 strains with the highest potential to induce a pro-inflammatory response and mono-colonized GF IL-10 −/− mice with the selected clinical Kp2 strains for 2 weeks ( Figure 4 G). Indeed, each of the tested Kp2 strains induced fecal lipocalin ( Figure 4 H) and IFN-γ ( Figure 4 I) compared to uninfected GF IL-10 −/− mice. Histopathological assessment of excised large intestines from mono-inoculated mice revealed severely inflamed colonic tissues, characterized by submucosal edema extending through the submuscular layer and the lamina propria, with major lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltration noted. No disruptive effect was noted on glandular structures, which were inflamed compared to GF IL-10 −/− mice ( Figures 4 J and 4K). Interestingly, in IL-10 −/− mice mono-inoculated with individual Kp2 strains, lamina propria IFN-γ levels and histopathological score of intestinal inflammation and damage were strongly correlated to each other ( Figure 4 L).
Given the above evidence of causal contributions of human IBD-associated antibiotic-resistant Kp strains to intestinal inflammation, we next sought to develop a phage combination therapy that specifically suppressed the pathogenic Kp2 clade. To this aim, phages targeting Kp-2H7 and 16 additional clinical Kp2 strains were isolated and tested in an iterative process until an effective combination was identified across all tested clade strains and mutants ( Figure 5 A; Table S6 ; STAR Methods ). Initially, six Kp-2H7-targeting phages were detected by the culturing of environmentally sourced phages (assembled from sewage and clinical samples) with Kp-2H7, followed by their isolation on bacterial lawns (round 1, Table S6 ). Kp-2H7 phages were sequenced, taxonomically classified to genus level, and tested in vitro on Kp-2H7. In this initial stage, Kp-2H7 mutants resistant to some or all of the initial six phages arose (mutants, Table S6 ). The next iteration involved novel phages isolation by the culturing of environmentally sourced phages with the resistant Kp-2H7 mutants, now used as targets ( Figure 5 Ai; Table S6 ). Thirty-two additional phages were isolated in this way and tested against Kp-2H7 and the six mutant bacterial strains for assessment of their host range. Based on the characterization of individual phages, 48 initial phage combinations were in silico designed and tested in vitro against Kp-2H7 ( Figure 5 Aii). Additionally, at the in vivo validation phase ( Figure 5 Aiv), one of the colonies isolated from a fecal pellet of treated mice was found to be a mutant of Kp2, resistant to all previously isolated phages. This phage-resistant Kp2 mutant was re-cultured with the original environmental phage collection and yielded three new phages that were active against this mutant (8M group, Table S6 ). These were integrated into new phage combinations and tested against 17 Kp2 strains (Kp-2H7, 7 mutants, and 9 clinical Kp2, Table S6 ) to examine their ability to suppress the appearance of resistant mutants. Collectively, this initial iterative process was used to isolate and functionally characterize a total of 41 phages active against Kp2 strains.
Eight of the 41 phages, including representatives of each identified phage genus, were selected for an in vitro validation phase ( Figure 5 Aiii), based on their host range and ability to target bacterial mutants. These eight phages were combined into 18 final three-, four-, and five-phage combinations. All of the 18 phage combinations included phage MCoc5c, which featured the widest host range and was effective against 14 Kp2 hosts, and phage 8M-7, which successfully lysed mutants that became resistant to MCoc5c ( Figure S7 A; Table S6 ). These 18 combinations were tested by introduction into cultures of Kp-2H7 and two clinical Kp2 isolates, 123-1 and 141-1 ( Figures 5 B–5D and S7 B–S7G). In these final in vitro validation experiments, only one of the three-phage combinations, 3(D), prevented Kp-2H7 regrowth over 20 h ( Figures 5 B, S7 B, and S7E) and was selected for further in vivo testing ( Figure 5 Aiv). All four-phage combinations were able to delay the appearance of mutants in cultures of 123-1 and 141-1 strains ( Figures 5 C, S7 C, and S7F), but only phage combinations 4(F) and 4(G) were efficient in delaying the appearance of mutants from Kp-2H7 ( Figures 5 C and S7 F). Therefore, phage combinations 4(F) and 4(G) were selected for further in vivo testing ( Figure 5 Aiv). All tested five-phage combinations successfully inhibited mutant emergence in cultures of the 141-1 strain ( Figures S7 D and S7G). However, only combinations 5(E) and 5(F) also effectively inhibited mutant development upon introduction to strains Kp-2H7 and 123-1 ( Figures 5 D and S7 G), and were therefore selected for further in vivo testing ( Figure 5 Aiv).
In vivo testing of the five-phage combinations 3(D), 4(F), 4(G), 5(E), and 5(F) was then carried out to assess their efficacy in reducing Kp2 burden upon oral administration to specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice colonized with either the Kp-2H7 or the 123-1 Kp2 strains, following a preemptive antibiotic treatment ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives TH1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 Aiv and 5E; STAR Methods ). SPF animals colonized with Kp-2H7 and treated with phage combinations 4(F), 4(G), and 5(E) displayed the most significant Kp2 load reduction of more than 3 logs compared to Kp2-colonized animals gavaged with vehicle (from 10 6 colony forming units [CFU]/g of stool detected in control mice to 10 3 CFU/g of stool in phage-treated mice, Figure 5 F). SPF mice colonized with the 123-1 strain and treated with phage combinations 5(E) and 5(F) displayed the most significant reduction in Kp load compared to Kp-infected animals receiving vehicle ( Figure 5 F). Collectively, phage combination 5(E), composed of phages MCoc5c, 8M-7, 1.2-3s, KP2-5-1, and PKP-55, featured the most consistent compositional and functional capacity to reduce bacterial burden of human IBD-associated Kp2 strains and was therefore selected for further experimentation in mice and in humans ( Figure 5 Av).
Morphological assessment of the five members of this phage consortium by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ( Figure S8 A), combined with whole-genome phage sequencing ( Figure S8 B), revealed that the 1.2-3s and 8M-7 phages display an icosahedral head (70–75 nm diameter) and a long flexible tail (210 nm) and belong to the Demerecviridae family; MCoc5c features a 50–54 nm icosahedral head and a short tail (8–10 nm) and belongs to the Autographiviridae family; PKP-55 and KP-2-5-1 feature elongated icosahedral heads (70–75 nm wide, 103–109 nm long) and a helical rigid tail (105 nm) and belong to the Myoviridae family. Phage genomes were not carrying toxic or virulent sequences (e.g., absent of ARGs, toxins, MGEs, and integrases) when screened against the relevant databases ( STAR Methods ). Importantly, metagenomic microbiota analysis revealed that the abundance of computationally predicted receptors, used by the selected five phages to dock on Kp2 strains, was significantly higher in IBD patients compared to healthy controls across cohorts ( STAR Methods ; Figure 5 G).
We next assessed the efficacy of phage combination 5(E) in reducing Kp2 load and impacting colonic inflammation in pre-clinical IBD models. We began by optimizing the oral administration protocol by administering the phage combination to Kp-2H7-colonized SPF mice after antibiotic treatment (4 days of tylosin, 4 days of ampicillin, 2 days of washout), at different phage concentrations and gavage frequencies, while testing their impact on Kp2 loads and phage concentrations ( Figures 6 A, 6B, S8 C, and S8D). Optimal Kp2 eradication was obtained by administering 10 7 PFU/mL of phage combination 5(E) on a daily basis ( Figure S8 C) or by administering 10 9 PFU/mL of the phage combination 5(E) in 3 weekly doses ( Figure 6 B). The highest phage replication was observed following administration of 10 9 PFU/mL in 3 weekly doses ( Figure 6 A), compared to daily doses ( Figure S8 D), coupled with a reduction in Kp-2H7 load in mucosa-adherent bacteria ( Figure 6 C). Moreover, administration of 10 9 PFU/mL of combination 5(E) in 3 weekly doses to Kp-2H7-mono-colonized GF mice markedly reduced the levels of colonic Kp-induced IFN-γ T cells ( Figure 6 D). Thus, this dosing regimen was selected for further testing.
Using this optimized protocol, we next determined whether phage combination 5(E) could ameliorate intestinal auto-inflammation induced by Kp2 strains in an acute IBD-like auto-inflammation, induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). In this model, 10 9 PFU/mL of combination 5(E) was administered by oral gavage to Kp-2H7-mono-colonized WT mice in 3 weekly doses, while mono-colonized control mice received only vehicle. Four days after the start of phage treatment, colonic auto-inflammation was induced by administration of 1.5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days ( Figure S8 E). Indeed, Kp-2H7 bacterial burden in the large intestinal stool ( Figure 6 E) and mucosa ( Figure 6 F) were significantly reduced in phage-treated mice. Colonic inflammatory features, including the percentage of lamina propria IFN-γ + CD4 + T cells ( Figure 6 G); levels of large intestinal cytokines, including IL-15, IL-17, IL-9 ( Figures 6 H–6J; Table S7 ) and other pro-inflammatory chemokines ( Figures S8 F–S8H; Table S7 ); and colitis severity quantified by colonoscopy ( Figure 6 K) were significantly attenuated in phage-treated mice. Histopathological assessment of DSS colitis-induced, vehicle-treated control mice featured a severe inflammatory process, involving the full thickness of the colon, including architectural distortion, edema, ulceration, and a lymphocyte- and neutrophil-predominant inflammatory infiltrate evident in all colonic layers. In contrast, phage-treated mice were notable for a marked amelioration of intestinal inflammation and tissue damage ( Figures 6 K–6M). Similar DSS colitis experiments, in which phage combination-treated mice were followed to recovery ( Figure S8 I), featured a sustained Kp load reduction ( Figure 6 N), coupled with a significantly improved survival in phage-treated mice as compared to vehicle-treated controls ( Figure 6 O). To assess the long-term pathobiont-suppressive capacity of a phage combination treatment in an auto-inflammatory context, GF Rag1 −/− mice were mono-colonized with 10 9 CFU/mL of Kp-2H7 and then transferred with 5 × 10 6 CD4 + CD45RB hi gh T cells, resulting in a mild sub-clinical disease ( Figure S8 J). Indeed, longer-term phage combination therapy under this setting induced a sustained chronic suppression of fecal ( Figure 6 P) and mucosal ( Figure 6 Q) Kp bacterial loads, with no evidence noted of anti-phage resistance and escape from pathobiont suppression. Sub-clinical inflammation, in this context, featured a non-significant trend of improvement under phage treatment ( Figures S8 L–S8M). The impact of phage combination therapy in preventing or treating full-blown chronic intestinal auto-inflammation, driven by a diverse microbiome antigenic load, merits further studies ( Kiesler, 2015 54. Kiesler, P. ∙ Fuss, I.J. ∙ Strober, W. Experimental Models of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Cell Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2015; 1 :154-170 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next determined the feasibility of phage combination treatment in the human setting. As intestinal biophysical characteristics markedly differ between mice and humans ( Park and Im, 2020 87. Park, J.C. ∙ Im, S.-H. Of men in mice: the development and application of a humanized gnotobiotic mouse model for microbiome therapeutics Exp. Mol. Med. 2020; 52 :1383-1396 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), we first assessed the stability of two selected phages of phage combination 5(E) upon passage through a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME) ( Van de Wiele et al., 2015 111. Van de Wiele, T. ∙ Van den Abbeele, P. ∙ Ossieur, W. ... The simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME(R)) Verhoeckx, K. ∙ Cotter, P. ∙ Lopez-Exposito, I. ... (Editors) The impact of food bioactives on health Springer International Publishing, 2015; 305-317 Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar ). In this system, phage resilience was modeled by sequential passage through a series of reactors representative of the bio-physiological conditions along the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT), under “fed” (low gastric pH) and “fasting” (high gastric pH) conditions ( Figure 7 A and S9 A). Phages selected for this assessment were 1.2-3s and MCoc5c, given their taxonomic uniqueness and different host range, enabling their unambiguous identification upon plating. Indeed, significant differences in preservation of phage activity were observed between the “fed” (low pH) and “fasting” (high pH) conditions ( Figure 7 B), with 1.2-3s phages featuring a loss of activity and MCoc5c phages featuring a near loss of activity (3 × 10 3 PFU/mL) at the end of the gastric phase under low pH conditions. In contrast, under higher gastric pH conditions, greater phage stability was noted (4 × 10 8 PFU/mL and 5 × 10 9 PFU/mL, for 1.2-3s and MCoc5c phages, respectively, Figure 7 B). The activity of both phages was not further impacted by factors and conditions simulating the human proximal small intestine, despite the presence of potentially toxic bile salts and pancreatic fluid in these reactors. Likewise, the activity of both phages remained stable throughout prolonged incubation in additional chambers representing more distal intestinal niches, such as the jejunum, ileum, and proximal and distal colon ( Figures 7 B–7D).
Finally, we tested both phages in human volunteers in a phase 1, first-in-human, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT04737876 ) aimed at assessing the viability of orally co-administered phages after passage through the GIT of healthy individuals. To this aim, we manufactured both phages following the principles of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) standards. Eighteen healthy adult volunteers (11 males and 7 females) were randomly assigned (in a ratio of 14:4, Figure S9 B) to orally receive either the two-phage combination or a placebo vehicle, administered as a liquid formulation twice a day for 3 days ( Figure 7 E). The phage combination included both MCoc5c and 1.2-3s at 2.8×10 10 total PFU per dose. Given the above simulation results, all subjects also received oral esomeprazole, 40 mg once a day from day −3 to day 3, to increase gastric pH, thereby optimizing phage survival. Uniquely, all excreted stool was collected from all participants from day −1 to day 6 of the trial to quantitatively measure the total amounts of viable phages by PFU analysis ( Figure 7 E; STAR Methods ).
The two-phage preparation was well-tolerated and had similar rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between treatment (42.9%) and placebo (50.0%) groups, the majority of which were mild ( Table S1 ). The most common TEAEs were headache (n = 2, or 14.3% of subjects receiving phage combinations; n = 2, or 50.0% of subjects receiving placebo), nausea (n = 2, or 14.3% of subjects receiving phages), and abdominal distension (n = 1, or 7.1% of subjects receiving phages; n = 1, or 25.0% of subjects receiving placebo). There was no treatment-related TEAE in the phage group; one subject (25.0% of receiving placebo) had a treatment-related TEAE (i.e., abdominal distension). No serious adverse events or TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug or study participation were noted. Likewise, no abnormal vital signs of clinical concern or clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values were noted among individuals consuming the phage preparation or placebo. On day 1, phages were detected in only 1 out of 12 subjects with samples collected (8.3%), likely reflecting the slow human intestinal transit time. However, in the following days, phages were detected in all subjects whose samples were collected (100%), except on day 3 in which phages were detected in 10 of 11 sampled individuals (90.9%, Figure S9 C). The median overall total PFU for MCoc5c and 1.2-3s, calculated across all stool samples collected for each of the 14 subjects, was 1.46 × 10 10 and 1.08 × 10 9 , respectively ( Figure 7 F). Interestingly, all subjects with available samples at days 4, 5, and 6 had phages detected, even though phage administration was completed on day 3 ( Figures 7 G and S9 C), possibly representing phage persistence. Collectively, the study met its primary objective, namely to demonstrate that the two Kp-targeting orally administered phages were safe and well tolerated in healthy adults. Furthermore, high levels of MCoc5c and 1.2-3s phages remained detectable in the GIT, even days after phage administration, and accumulated in total doses expected to surpass the target bacteria level of Kp strains as measured in IBD patients by nearly 1,000-fold. Fecal microbiota shotgun metagenomic sequencing demonstrated an expected extremely low baseline Kp abundance in all healthy participants ( Figure S9 D) while detecting an increased abundance of the administered two phages only in phage-treated individuals, thereby validating the PFU quantification ( Figures S9 E and S9F). No off-target dysbiosis was observed in phage-treated participants ( Figures 7 H and 7I). Kp2 suppression and possible off-target effects induced by the full phage combination merit future studies in humans harboring IBD-relevant Kp2 strains.

Section: Discussion

Our results feature several potentially important implications. First, they demonstrate that an extensive species- and strain-level elucidation of microbiota involvement in complex diseases, performed in geographically and environmentally distinct populations, may enable the identification of specific clades of disease-contributing pathobiont species and strains (“driver” strains) while differentiating them from many other strains whose altered abundance is secondary to disease-related processes (“passenger” strains). Such optimized resolution would also likely clarify some ambiguous findings related to species-level disease associations ( Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017 44. Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Kua, L. ...

Med. 2019; 25 :679-689 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ) while focusing treatment efforts toward true pathobiont strains in given clinical contexts.
Second, suppression of such pathobiont strains and species, without the emergence of bacterial resistance to treatment ( Nikolich and Filippov 2020 79. Nikolich, M.P. ∙ Filippov, A.A. Bacteriophage therapy: developments and directions Antibiotics. 2020; 9 :135 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ), may be made possible by rationally designing diverse phage combinations, in which each phage member attacks some or all strains belonging to a bacterial species of interest through distinct mechanisms ( Sarker et al., 2012 94. Sarker, S.A. ∙ McCallin, S. ∙ Barretto, C. ... Oral T4-like phage cocktail application to healthy adult volunteers from Bangladesh Virology. 2012; 434 :222-232 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dedrick et al., 2019 29. Dedrick, R.M. ∙ Guerrero-Bustamante, C.A. ∙ Garlena, R.A. ... Engineered bacteriophages for treatment of a patient with a disseminated drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :730-733 Crossref Scopus (602) PubMed Google Scholar ). The narrow host specificity of phages represents one advantage for such treatment by minimizing off-target dysbiosis on the surrounding microbiota. The self-replicating nature of lytic phages upon engagement with their host represents an additional potential advantage by allowing phages to self-maintain as long as target pathobiont levels exceed a threshold, while declining upon bacterial target suppression ( Sabouri Ghannad and Mohammadi 2012 93. Sabouri Ghannad, M. ∙ Mohammadi, A. Bacteriophage: time to re-evaluate the potential of phage therapy as a promising agent to control multidrug-resistant bacteria Iran. J. Basic Med. Sci. 2012; 15 :693-701 PubMed Google Scholar ). Such combinatorial phage treatment approach would likely benefit from selection of strictly lytic phages (over lysogenic ones) that would ensure a higher efficiency of bacterial lysis, while reducing the risk of horizontal gene transfer of toxins or ARGs into bacterial chromosomes by lysogeny ( Sulakvelidze et al., 2001 102. Sulakvelidze, A. ∙ Alavidze, Z. ∙ Morris, J.G. Bacteriophage therapy Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45 :649-659 Crossref Scopus (1148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, genomic phage manipulation may enable the conversion of lysogenic phages into strictly lytic phages by the deletion of their integrase genes or alteration of natural phage specificity toward pre-determined identification of new hosts without impacting their antimicrobial properties ( Pires et al., 2021 88. Pires, D.P. ∙ Monteiro, R. ∙ Mil-Homens, D. ... Designing P. aeruginosa synthetic phages with reduced genomes Sci. Rep. 2021; 11 :2164 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to its therapeutic potential, such phage combination treatment could be highly advantageous in microbiota research, by enabling the testing of putative disease-causing commensals.
Third, such multi-phage approaches are likely feasible in humans, with orally administered phages able to endure the fluctuating biophysical conditions along the GIT and accumulate in the lower gut and stool. Such an oral administration route may avoid phage-induced immunogenicity that limits systemic phage administration over time ( Majewska et al., 2019 73. Majewska, J. ∙ Kaźmierczak, Z. ∙ Lahutta, K. ... Induction of Phage-Specific Antibodies by Two Therapeutic Staphylococcal Bacteriophages Administered per os Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :2607 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). In IBD, such treatment may potentially supplement induction therapy, in which pathobiont suppression will assist in the quenching of acute disease exacerbation (as pre-clinically shown in our studies) or maintenance therapy, in which chronic suppression of pathobionts may delay or prevent disease flare-ups. These exciting prospects merit further studies. Of note, the current study focused on the development of suppressive phage therapy against one IBD-relevant pathobiont clade. As some non-Kp2 strains may also contribute to the pro-inflammatory response noted in our pre-clinical models ( Figures 4 B and 4C), “Next-generation” Kp phage combinations (currently under development and testing) may target additional clades or even the entire spectrum of the Kp species in further optimizing phage treatment of intestinal auto-inflammation. Personalization of such phage treatment could be further achieved, as a companion diagnostic, by patient-based characterization of dominant pathobionts, coupled with an in vitro assessment of phage combination suppressive efficacy against them. Importantly, similar treatment approaches may be developed to target other IBD-targeting pathobionts identified in our study, and in others, and be integrated with currently utilized immune-modulatory IBD treatments. Similar phage combination treatment could be harnessed to suppress pathobionts contributing to a number of other microbiome-contributed communicable and non-communicable human diseases, including, among others, S tretococcus agalactiae -linked bacterial vaginosis ( van de Wijgert et al., 2020 113. van de Wijgert, J.H.H.M. ∙ Verwijs, M.C. ∙ Gill, A.C. ... Pathobionts in the Vaginal Microbiota: Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis of Three Sequencing Studies Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2020; 10 :129 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) or H elicobacter pylori -associated peptic ulcer disease ( Camilo et al., 2017 17. Camilo, V. ∙ Sugiyama, T. ∙ Touati, E. Pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection Helicobacter. 2017; 22 :e12405 Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar ).
The impact of diet ( De Angelis et al., 2020 27. De Angelis, M. ∙ Ferrocino, I. ∙ Calabrese, F.M. ... Diet influences the functions of the human intestinal microbiome Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :4247 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), age, oral versus colonoscopy administration methods, transit time on the microbiota, and effectiveness of phage treatment ( Wilmanski et al., 2021 114.

Age and the aging process significantly alter the small bowel microbiome Cell Rep. 2021; 36 :109765 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) merits further research. Combined oral and systemic phage administration may optimize therapy, especially when dealing with invasive pathobionts, thereby meriting further studies. Of note, phage-resistant bacteria often feature fitness defects resulting in an enhanced susceptibility to antibiotics ( Ormälä and Jalasvuori 2013 84. Ormälä, A.M. ∙ Jalasvuori, M. Phage therapy: Should bacterial resistance to phages be a concern, even in the long run? Bacteriophage. 2013; 3 :e24219 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, phage assortments combined with antibiotics may generate synergistic activity even in face of previous antibiotic resistance to disease-promoting pathobionts. Bacterial lysis-induced localized inflammation ( Norman et al., 2015 81. Norman, J.M. ∙ Handley, S.A. ∙ Baldridge, M.T. ...

Gogokhia, L. ∙ Buhrke, K. ∙ Bell, R. ... Expansion of bacteriophages is linked to aggravated intestinal inflammation and colitis Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :285-299.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ) merit further studies. Refinement of phage selection, such as by in silico analyses ( Abedon 2017 1. Abedon, S.T. Information phage therapy research should report Pharmaceuticals. 2017; 10 :43 Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar ) and optimization of phage penetration through the mucus layer into the intestinal crypt, will likely constitute exciting avenues of future research. With these challenges notwithstanding, our study introduces a framework toward future targeted suppression of pathobionts in expanding the repertoire of personalized treatments against microbiota-modulated non-communicable human disease.

Israel: the observational human study was approved by Tel Aviv Medical Center (Ichilov) Institutional Review Board (IRB approval number RBI 0367-15-TLV). Germany: approval for human studies was obtained from the local ethics committee (Kiel University, IRB approval number A148/14, A117-13, A156-03). France: approval for human studies was obtained from the local ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes 'Île-de-France IV, IRB 00003835 Suivitheque study; registration number 2012/05NICB). USA: the observational human study was approved by Advarra Institutional Review Board (IRB approval numbers ISPC-161704-RUO and ISPC-160630-REM/RUO). Subjects in all cohorts ( Figure S1 A) fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) male or female, over the age of 18, provided informed consent; (2) not following any interventional diet modification. Furthermore, inclusion criteria for IBD patients also included clinical diagnosis of IBD based on standard of care investigations, consistent with international practice guidelines, confirmed and documented by an investigator. Exclusion criteria for IBD patients were: (1) antibiotic treatment within three months of consent; (2) patients with history of colorectal cancer or cholangiocarcinoma within one year of consent; (3) recent clinically documented infection or active clinically significant systemic inflammatory condition unrelated to IBD; (4) pregnant or lactating women. Exclusion criteria for healthy individuals were: (1) antibiotic or probiotic use in the previous three months; (2) self-reported acute or chronic infectious disease; (3) background of gastrointestinal disease, under active medical treatment or follow up, including IBD (CD, UC), celiac disease, intestinal surgery (other than historic appendectomy and gallbladder removal); (4) background of significant limiting autoimmune disease, kidney disease, metabolic disorder, endocrine disorder, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, neurological disease; (5) chronic medication usage (except for hormonal contraception). Following inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients did not undergo antibiotic treatment at least starting from 3 months prior the beginning of the study.
A total of 537 subjects (including healthy individuals, CD and UC) were enrolled in Tel Aviv Medical Center (Ichilov, Israel) and Assistance Publique, Hopitaux de Paris (France), University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) or iSpecimen Inc. (MA, USA), between 2016 and 2019 ( Figure S1 A). Patients from France, Israel and the USA were further classified as undergoing a flare or a remission state, based on clinical activity prospectively assessed by the physician in charge of the patient. Patients with no or mild digestive symptoms were considered in remission. All other cases were considered as flare. Stool samples were collected using a dedicated specimen container, placed into a sterile tube, then frozen at −80°C until use. For bacterial isolation, stool samples were collected in designated glycerol-containing tubes.
This study (NCT04737876) was a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of an orally administered two-phage combination, to deliver at least one of the two phages that remained viable in the GIT and could be measured in the stool. The study was conducted in the Medpace Clinical Pharmacology Unit (Cincinnati, Ohio, United States) after IND (FDA) and IRB approval. For inclusion/exclusion criteria, see the ‘ Enrollment and eligibility ’ section.
Eligible subjects were randomly assigned, by a ratio of 14:4, to phage combination or placebo, administered twice daily as a liquid dose after completion of a meal. A combination of 2 phages (MCoc5c and 1.2-3s) was supplied in vials of 1.2 mL total volume (1 mL was extractable) at a titer of approximately 2.8 × 10 10 PFU/mL total phage in a clear, colorless liquid formulation with a pH of 6.8. On the other hand, placebo was supplied in a vial of 1.2 mL total volume (1 mL was extractable), consisting of the same clear, colorless liquid with a pH of 7.3. The two-phage combination and placebo were packaged in sterile Type 1 Pyro-free 2 mL clear tubular glass vials with a rubber stopper, sealed by complete tear off aluminum seal, and stored between 2°C to 8°C. Both phages were manufactured, mixed and filled according to Good Manufacturing Practice, including bioreactors for phage propagation and multiple chromatographic steps for purification. The phages were packed, labeled, and formally released in accordance with regulatory requirements for oral drug administration. Phage combination or placebo was administered in a fed state (30 min after completion of breakfast and dinner) from day 1 to day 3. All subjects also received oral esomeprazole 40 mg (Medpace Clinical Pharmacology Unit Pharmacy) once a day, starting three days prior to the administration of the combination or placebo, until day 3, in order to increase gastric pH, and thus optimize conditions for survival of phage during passage through the stomach. All subjects had the option to receive commercially available oral Senokot-S (sennoside 8.6 mg/docusate sodium 50 mg) as an optional mild laxative, if needed, in case of constipation (defined as no bowel movement for two consecutive days from day −1 to day 6). The dose and schedule of Senokot-S were consistent with prescribing information. The Clinical Study Protocol and informed consent form were submitted to and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the center prior to initiation of the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with all applicable laws and regulations of the locale and country where the study was conducted, and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.
A total of 49 subjects were screened in this study from day −8 to day −4 from phage administration. Serum chemistry and hematology, alcohol test, urine drug screen, serologies (HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody) and urine and serum pregnancy tests (on females of childbearing potential) were collected as screening assessments. The main inclusion criteria were healthy adult subjects between 18 and 65 years of age, who provided informed consent. Key exclusion criteria were evidence or history of clinically significant underlying conditions, a history of constipation, severe diarrhea, and/or loose stools within 14 days prior to first dose of esomeprazole, a history of procedures aimed at modifying the gastrointestinal microbiota within the past year (e.g., fecal microbiota transplantation), topical gastrointestinal treatment (e.g., enemas) during the two weeks prior to screening visit or planned during the study, use of bowel cleansing or preparation for any reason in the four weeks prior to screening visit or planned during the study, nursing, pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study, or women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraceptive measures, known allergy or hypersensitivity to an excipient in the study drug or placebo, any other reason which according to the investigator may impact proper study conduct, or history of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, medication abuse, or tobacco use within the past year. Eighteen subjects met all criteria and were randomized to phage combination or placebo. All 18 subjects completed the trial and received a phone call, conducted by site staff, for safety evaluation 14 and 28 days after the last dose of study drug.
The primary endpoint was the evaluation of safety of the two-phage combination by reviewing vital signs, laboratory tests and adverse events (AEs). Vital signs included blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature and pulse rate and were measured at screening phase (day −8 to day −4 prior to the initiation of the treatment), and at day −1 to day 6 post-treatment. Laboratory tests included hematology (complete blood count) and serum chemistry (comprehensive metabolic panel), and were conducted at screening and day 6. Any abnormality in vital signs and laboratory tests were graded according to the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials. Safety was assessed through summaries of TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs; there were no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in this study. Pre-specified stopping rules for the study included the following: one or more subjects with SAE that was possibly or probably related to phage combination administration as assessed by the investigator, and two or more subjects with AEs graded as severe, of the same type, that were considered possibly or probably related to phage combination administration. None of the criteria in the pre-specified stopping rules were met during the study.
In all experiments, age- and gender-matched mice were used. At the Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS), animal experiments were approved by the WIS Animal Care and Use Committee following USA National Institutes of Health, European Commission, and the Israeli guidelines. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) WT male mice with a C57BL/6 background and eight weeks of age were purchased from Harlan (Envigo) and allowed to acclimatize to the animal facility for two weeks prior to the experiments. All mice were kept in a strict 24 h light-dark cycle, with lights being turned on from 6 am to 6 pm. GF WT and Rag1 −/− mice were bred at the WIS GF facility. All experimental groups were separately housed. Experiments were approved by WIS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee no. 14210519-2 and 04020522-2.
In all mouse experiments assessing the phage combinations, SPF WT C57BL/6 male mice of eight weeks of age were purchased from Harlan (Envigo) and allowed to acclimatize for five days in the animal facility. GF mice were bred and maintained within the gnotobiotic facility of WIS. All animal experiments were approved by the local (Israeli) ethics committee. In experiments performed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), 8–12 weeks GF 129SvEv background IL-10-deficient ( Il-10 −/− ) and Il-10 +/eGFP mice (C57BL/6 background IL-10 -eGFP-reporter, IL-10-sufficient), also named Vert-X mice ( Madan, 2009 72. Madan, R. ∙ Demircik, F. ∙ Surianarayanan, S. ... Nonredundant roles for B cell-derived IL-10 in immune counter-regulation J. Immunol. 2009; 83 :2312-2320 Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar ) were obtained from the UNC National Gnotobiotic Rodent Resource Center. All animal procedures were approved by the UNC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In all experiments performed in Keio University School of Medicine (KUSM), C57BL/6 mice under GF conditions were purchased from Sankyo Laboratories Japan or CLEA Japan. GF mice were bred and maintained within the gnotobiotic facility of KUSM and JSR-Keio University Medical and Chemical Innovation Center. All animal experiments were approved by the Keio University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
The genome of K. pneumoniae Kp-2H7 strain described by Atarashi and colleagues ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives TH1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ) has been sequenced and is publicly available, i.e. GenBank: BDQR01000001.1 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/BDQR01000001.1 ). Clinical Kp2 strains were defined as Kp strains that belong to the multi-locus sequence type ST-323 ( Figure S4 B). These strains were isolated on selective media from stool derived from IBD patients and healthy controls. Selected colonies underwent colony PCR using primers ( STAR Methods ) as published ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives TH1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ), analyzed by Ribosomal 16S Sanger sequencing, and confirmed as Kp2 after full genome analysis using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).
K. pneumoniae Kp-2H7 or clinical isolates were grown in BHI (BD) plus yeast extract (0.5%) or Schaedler broth to OD 600 = 1.00, at 37°C in aerobic and 180 rpm shaking conditions and adjusted to a concentration of 5 × 10 9 CFU/mL in PBS without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ . GF WT C57BL/6, GF IL-10 −/− , GF RAG1 −/− were orally gavaged with 200 μL of the bacterial suspension in PBS without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ , or sterile PBS as control. Fresh stool pellets were collected before bacterial inoculation (week 0) and at necropsy (week 2, 3 or 4), and intestinal content was harvested. Two stool pellets were collected and stored at −80°C (for qPCR), or on ice to estimate bacterial loads. Colonic tissues were harvested, and placed in sterile cold PBS for cell isolation, and colony forming units (CFU) counts from lamina propria. For colonization of mice with a bacterial consortium, IL-10 eGFP reporter mice were infected with twelve Kp bacterial strains as follows: Kp strains were cultured in BHI broth and adjusted to a final OD 600 = 1. Mice were orally gavaged with the bacterial mixture at day 0 ( Mishima et al., 2019 76. Mishima, Y. ∙ Oka, A. ∙ Liu, B. ... Microbiota maintain colonic homeostasis by activating TLR2/MyD88/PI3K signaling in IL-10-producing regulatory B cells J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :3702-3716 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). SPF WT C57BL/6 mice received antibiotics to disrupt the gut microbiota, specifically tylosin (final concentration 0.5 g/L, Sigma) for four days, followed by a treatment with ampicillin (final concentration 0.2 g/L, Gol Bio) for four days, and a final period of two days wash out with regular drinking water. All experimental groups were separately housed.
In order to study the stability of bacteriophages during passage through the human upper GIT and colonic environment under low and high pH conditions, we utilized the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem or SHIME®, ( Van de Wiele et al., 2015 111. Van de Wiele, T. ∙ Van den Abbeele, P. ∙ Ossieur, W. ... The simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME(R)) Verhoeckx, K. ∙ Cotter, P. ∙ Lopez-Exposito, I. ... (Editors) The impact of food bioactives on health Springer International Publishing, 2015; 305-317 Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar ) of ProDigest, which recreates, in different reactors, the physiological conditions representative of the human GIT. The system was optimized to simulate in vivo pH and incubation times present in the different regions of the GI tract. Physiological conditions of the stomach and small intestine (upper GIT) were sequentially simulated in the same reactor over time. Following passage through the reactor mimicking the upper GIT, the suspension was transferred to either proximal or distal colon simulating reactors, containing a full-grown and active colonic microbiota derived from a healthy human donor.
In order to mimic the different phases of digestion in the upper GIT, several suspensions were added to the reactor. To simulate fed conditions, a 2 h incubation at 37°C was performed with a sigmoidal decrease of the pH profile noted from 4.6 to 3.0 with the addition of HCl 0.5 M. In contrast, to simulate fasting conditions, a higher pH profile was implemented (adding less HCl solution), i.e., starting at 5.5 and decreasing until a pH of 4.5 was reached over a 2-h period. Furthermore, pepsin (Roche) was supplied, with the activity being standardized by measuring absorbance increase at 280 nm of TCA-soluble products, upon digestion of hemoglobin as a standard protein. Phosphatidylcholine was also added to increase the lipolytic activity at low pH. To mimic the presence of nutrients, a rich medium was added to the reactor. Sampling occurred at t = 0 and t = 120 min ( Figure 7 A).
To simulate conditions in the small intestine, which consist of a higher pH compared to the gastric phase, a standardized solution of bile salts (10 mM bovine bile extract) and pancreatic juice, containing NaHCO 3 and pancreatic enzymes, was added to the same reactor. Specifically, while stirring, the pH was increased to 6.5 and maintained constant over a 27 min period (duodenal phase). This phase was followed by a stepwise pH increase to a value of 7.5 over the course of 63 min (jejunal phase). Finally, the pH remained constant at 7.5 for 90 min (ileal phase). The temperature was kept constant at 37°C throughout. Samples were taken at t = 0 min (stomach), t = 120 min (antrum), t = 147 min (duodenum), t = 237 min (jejunum) and t = 357 min (ileum) ( Figure 7 A).
Healthy human adult donors (n = 10) were screened by qPCR to identify a non-Kp carrier who would serve as a donor for the study. For this aim, fecal material was collected by mixing 1 g of stool with 10 mL of PBS: glycerol (25%, v/v) and stored at −80°C. Fecal DNA was extracted from samples using the Powerfecal Pro DNA kit (Qiagen). Different fecal samples from the selected donor were exposed for two weeks to specific physical conditions of nutrients and pH to obtain samples resembling the bacterial composition from human proximal or distal colon. These samples were placed into two different reactors (proximal or distal) for the phase of short-term colonic incubation ( Figure 7 A).
The short-term colonic incubation was initiated by adding medium derived from the upper GIT to a rich medium (arabinogalactan, pectin, xylan, starch, glucose, yeast extract, peptone, mucin, L-cysteine-HCl, NaCl, KCl), together with the stabilized colonic microbiota samples. Four conditions were tested: samples from the i) low or ii) high pH conditions were tested in the proximal colon reactor; samples from the (iii) low or (iv) high pH conditions were tested in the distal colon reactor. Incubations were performed anaerobically for 21 h, at 37°C under shaking conditions (90 rpm). Samples were collected after 0, 0.5, 2, 16 and 21 h for PFU counts ( Figure 7 A).
At the beginning of the gastric phase, 1 mL of a 5 × 10 9 PFU/mL stock solution of both phages (1.2-3s and MCoc5c, theoretical total value of 9.7 log PFU) was introduced to the reactors at the beginning of the gastric phase. Samples were collected after 0, 0.5, 2, 16 and 21 h, and examined for phage activity. Specifically, at the end of the gastric phase, 1 mL-aliquots were extracted from each reactor, and 875 μL were mixed with 125 μL of a bicarbonate solution (0.5 M) to increase the pH and neutralize the pepsin activity. Samples extracted at the end of the duodenum, end of the jejunum and end of the ileum were mixed with a 1/20 diluted protease inhibitor solution, to prevent further enzymatic breakdown of the bacteriophages. Five hundred μL of sample were mixed with 1500 μL of the 1/20 diluted protease inhibitor solution. Prior to initiation of the PFU assay, the samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 9000 rpm, filtered through a 0.22 μm Whatman filter and stored at 4°C. Finally, the samples were serially diluted in PBS, and spotted onto BHIS plates coated with 0.2% or 0.4% top agar, in which the appropriate specific bacterial hosts were embedded, to allow the activity of each of the two phages to be distinguished (Kp-2H7 for 1.2-3ls phage, Kp2-Mcoc for MCoc5lc). Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. Results were calculated based on the dilution factor and reported as average log 10 PFU ± st. dev. (n = 3).
Metagenomic data were produced as follows ( Kummen et al., 2021 59. Kummen, M. ∙ Thingholm, L.B. ∙ Rühlemann, M.C. ... Altered gut microbial metabolism of essential nutrients in primary sclerosing cholangitis Gastroenterology. 2021; 160 :1784-1798.e0 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ): DNA content from fecal samples was extracted for genomic library preparation using PureLink™ Microbiota DNA Purification Kit. Extracted DNA concentration was quantified using Invitrogen™ Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit and diluted to the same concentration per sample. Subsequently, genomic DNA was fragmented to 350 bp using Covaris E220x, and libraries were prepared using TruSeq® DNA PCR-Free Library Prep (Illumina). Libraries were pooled together at equimolar concentration, and sequenced using Novaseq 6000 S4 (Illumina), with 150 bp, paired-end reads. For the French cohort, samples were sequenced in an average sequencing depth of 170.96±127.18 million reads; for the German cohort, 23.31±8.21 million reads, for the Israeli cohort, 238.93±52.38 million reads; and for the USA cohort 82.64±15.72 million reads. For the Phase I Clinical Trial, samples were sequenced with an average sequencing depth of 76.74±18.34 million reads ( Table S1 ).
Data from sequencer were converted to FASTQ files with bcl2fastq. QC trimming was carried out using Fastp ( Chen et al., 2018 20. Chen, S. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Chen, Y. ... fastp: an ultra-fast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :i884-i890 Crossref Scopus (5219) PubMed Google Scholar ), and host sequences were removed with Bowtie2 (2.4.1) ( Langmead and Salzberg 2012 62. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (26876) PubMed Google Scholar ) and human genome reference hg37. Samples were rarefied to 5x10 6 reads using Seqtk (1.3-r114) ( https://github.com/lh3/seqtk ). Taxonomic classification was performed utilizing Kraken2 (2.0.9) ( Wood et al., 2019 116.

Improved metagenomic analysis with Kraken 2 Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :257 Crossref Scopus (1333) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB, version 89). Abundances were computed with the Bracken method (2.5.3) ( Lu et al., 2017 71. Lu, J. ∙ Breitwieser, F.P. ∙ Thielen, P. ... Bracken: estimating species abundance in metagenomics data PeerJ Computer Science. 2017; 3 :e104 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alpha and beta diversity, based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, were analyzed using Vegan R-package ( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegan ). Differential species abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 70. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (33858) PubMed Google Scholar ). Combined analysis was performed integrating all comparisons in order to identify the top consistently enriched species across cohorts, associated with disease (p adj<0.05 & log 2 FC > 2) and flare-up (p adj<0.05 & log 2 FC > 1.5). Refinement of Kp signals. After taxonomical classification with Kraken2, reads assigned to Kp were aligned to a representative genomic sequence (GCA_000742135.1) using Bowtie2. For each sample, the number of reads aligning to 500 bp Kp windows was quantified and the normalized signal (number of reads in a genomic window/total Kp reads) was computed. For each cohort, normalized values were combined and over-enriched regions in each participant were defined as those with an outlier normalized signal (Z-score>2). Values over this threshold were trimmed to obtain the expected normalized signal. After correcting the number of Kp reads, a new differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 70. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (33858) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S2 , Table S5 ). For the French cohort, the sequences of the genomic windows with an outlier normalized signal were aligned to the NCBI nucleotide (nt) database using BLASTN to identify those with high homology to other species ( Figure S3 ). Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) analyses. Kp identification and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were performed using Kleborate (v0.4.0-b)(github.com/katholt/Kleborate) ( Lam et al., 2021 61.

Commun. 2021; 12 :4188 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). ST323 corresponds to Kp2 clade. Kp strain detection and quantification. Genomic sequences of 356 Kp strains were downloaded from the NCBI database, including the Kp-2H7 sequence (GenBank: BDQR01000001.1 ) ( Atarashi et al., 2017 7. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives TH1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the Strainest method ( Albanese and Donati 2017 2. Albanese, D. ∙ Donati, C. Strain profiling and epidemiology of bacterial species from metagenomic sequencing Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :2260 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), a Single-Nucleotide Variants (SNV) profile was computed for all these genomic sequences and, after clustering, 89 representative strains were selected. Refined Kp reads were aligned to these SNV profiles to quantify the number and identity of the coexisting representative strains in each individual, as well as their relative abundances in each metagenomic sample with a sufficient number of Kp reads. Differential strain abundance analysis was computed using Mann-Whitney test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction, comparing each IBD subtype versus Ctrl or flare versus remission ( Table S5 ). Microbiota functional analysis. Biocyc pathways quantification was performed using Humann3 ( Franzosa et al., 2018 42. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Rahnavard, G. ... Species-level functional profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :962-968 Crossref Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar ), and differential analysis was performed considering global microbiota or Kp signal alone. KEGG Orthology (KO) terms were quantified by combining DIAMOND (v2.0.6) ( Buchfink et al., 2021 16. Buchfink, B. ∙ Reuter, K. ∙ Drost, H.-G. Sensitive protein alignments at tree-of-life scale using DIAMOND Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :366-368 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the UniRef90 database ( Suzek et al., 2015 105.

Novel primers and probes were designed for quantification of Kp-2H7 strain, in clinical samples: Amp11 (Fwd-TGGCGGACTGCAACACTGT, Rev-TGCTCAGGCCGAAACGAT, Probe 6-FAM/ACCTGCGGGAATC/MGBNFQ) and Amp30 (Fwd-TTGCAAAGAATATCACAAAGGGTTT, Rev-GGATTTTGGATGGCCAGAAA, Probe 6-FAM/AAGAAAAAGAGTCTGGAGTATGA/MGBNFQ). DNA was purified from 200 mg of feces using QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA Kit (Qiagen, #51804), following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration was measured using Quant-iT dsDNA broad range assay kit (Thermo, Q33130) by the Spark microplate reader (Tecan) and 2 μg/well were tested in duplicates. Standard curves of Kp-2H7 were generated from gDNA amended with 5 ng/well of Herring Sperm DNA as background. Samples were amplified by PrimeTime Gene Expression Master Mix (IDT, #1055771) in 30 μL of total volume. Thermal protocol was run as follows: 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 s, and 60°C for 30 s.
Fecal samples were collected, weighed, and stored at −80°C until processing (for up to 24 h). Ten grams of each fecal sample were supplemented with 40 mL of cold BHIS and mixed vigorously. Each sample was transferred into a Stomacher bag and processed for 4 min until homogenized. Ten mL of the homogenate were centrifuged (4°C, 9000 g, 10 min). Sample was then filtered twice through a 0.45 μm filter, aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Filtrate samples were tested by PFU in triplicates on two hosts, each specific for one bacteriophage (Kp-2H7 for 1.2-3s phage, Kp2-Mcoc for MCoc5c). Total PFUs for each phage were calculated as the sum of PFU/mL × constant (4 mL/g) × stool weight (g); if several samples were collected from the same subject on the same day, total PFUs were added.
Longitudinal stool samples (n = 52) were collected from the 18 adult healthy individuals. Human genomic DNA was purified using a PowerMag Soil DNA isolation kit (Qiagen) optimized for the Tecan automated platform. For shotgun sequencing, Illumina libraries were prepared using a Nextera DNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq platform with a paired-end configuration and a read length of 150 bp. For microbiota analysis, days were categorized as baseline (day −1 and 1), mid stage (day 2, 3 and 4) or end stage (day 5 and 6) of the therapy. Analysis was performed following the same methodology used for the four human independent cohorts. In addition, phage quantification was performed utilizing Kraken2 (2.0.9) ( Wood et al., 2019 116. Wood, D.E. ∙ Lu, J. ∙ Langmead, B. Improved metagenomic analysis with Kraken 2 Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :257 Crossref Scopus (1333) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB, version 89) combined with the two phage genomes (1.2-3s and MCoc5c).
Stool samples from infected and non-infected control mice were collected and weighed. Results are expressed as CFUs or PFUs per gram of stool, or gram of mucosal tissue in case of mucosa-associated bacteria. Plating was performed in duplicates. The protocol was performed with small local modifications. At WIS, stool samples were weighed, and 1 mL of sterile PBS together with one metal stainless steel bead were added to the fecal pellet. The tube was then processed in TissueLyser (Qiagen) for homogenization of the content, for 30 s at frequency of 30/s. The obtained homogenate was centrifuged at 250 g for 1 min. The resulted supernatant (100 μL) was transferred into a new tube containing 2 mL of sterile PBS, while the remaining homogenate solution was stored at 4°C for subsequent phage count. The 2 mL tube was then centrifuged at 3250 g for 12 min, 4°C, to wash residual phages that could compromise bacterial counts. After centrifugation, PBS was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μL of PBS. Ten-fold serial dilutions were performed, and 10 μL were plated onto McConkey agar plus ampicillin (50 μg/mL, Tivan Biotech), spectinomycin (50 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich), metronidazole (50 μg/mL, LKT Labs) and tylosin (50 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich). Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C.
For phage counts, the remaining homogenate from the the previous step was centrifuged at 7200 g for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was filtered through 0.22 μm sterile filters (Merck) and serially diluted in PBS. Five μL of each dilution were then spotted onto 0.4% soft agar, where Kp was embedded, with the addition of antibiotics, as described above, and 1 mM of Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ . The plate was dried and incubated overnight at 37°C, until the appearance of phage plaques.
At BiomX, stool samples were resuspended in 5 mL of sterile PBS and homogenized for 3 min at maximum speed using a MiniMix blender (Interscience). A 1 mL sample was transferred into a new tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 g. Afterward, the supernatant was filtered through 0.22 μm, (Merck), placed in a new tube and stored at 4°C for PFU counts. The pellet was washed two additional times, by resuspending in 1 mL of PBS and centrifuging for 5 min at 2000 g. The pellet obtained after the 3 washing cycles was resuspended with 1 mL of PBS, and the resulting suspension was used to prepare seven 4-fold serial dilutions, to plate for bacterial counting. Five μL of each dilution were plated on MacConkey agar selective plates supplemented with tylosin (50 μg/mL), ampicillin (50 μg/mL) and spectinomycin (50 μg/mL). For phage counts, the filtered supernatant from the first wash was diluted by 4-fold serial dilutions. Five μL of each dilution was spotted onto BHIS plates covered with 0.4% agar overlay BHIS, inoculated with the relevant bacterial host strain and supplemented by 1 mM of Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ , incubated at 37°C overnight. Phage counts were determined by counting the plaques visible on the bacterial loan.
For evaluation of Kp bacterial and phage load in intestinal mucosa, a piece of colon was cut open along its length, washed by serially dipping the tissue in 6 wells of a 24-well plate, prefilled with sterile PBS, and then weighed. The mucosa was then processed in 5 mL sterile PBS by GentleMACS dissociator (GentleMACS, M tubes). Processed samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4500 g, 4°C. The supernatant was filtered (0.22 μm filter, Merck), and analyzed for PFU counts, as previously described. For the CFUs counts, the pellet was washed three times with PBS, resuspended with 1 mL of PBS, and serially diluted. Five μL of the dilutions were plated onto McConkey agar plates, supplemented with selective antibiotics, as described above. When colonies were not detected, the minimum value assigned to the sample was 1 colony in the most concentrated dilution (x = 10 3 CFUs). In UNC, confirmation of colonization with Kp strains was performed by colony forming units (CFUs) on MacConkey agar plates, incubated overnight under aerobic conditions. In KUSM, confirmation of colonization with Kp strains was performed by assessment of CFUs from stool homogenate on LB agar plates.
For ex vivo stimulation, bacterial lysates were prepared from individual colonies as previously described ( Eun et al., 2014 38. Eun, C.S. ∙ Mishima, Y. ∙ Wohlgemuth, S. ... Induction of bacterial antigen-specific colitis by a simplified human microbiota consortium in gnotobiotic interleukin-10-/- mice Infect. Immun. 2014; 82 :2239-2246 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cultured bacteria were disrupted with 0.1-mm glass microbeads (BioSpec Products) in MD buffer (0.1 M magnesium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 mg/mL DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) by using a bead beater (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The samples were then centrifuged at 10000 g for 15 min at 4°C and supernatants were filtered through 0.45 μm filters (Genesee Scientific, CA, USA). Potential contaminations in the lysates were verified by using YCFA agar cultures at 37°C for 5 days, both aerobically and anaerobically (Whitley MG500 workstation, N 2 :H 2 :CO 2 = 80:10:10, Don Whitley Scientific, West Yorkshire, UK). Total protein concentration was measured by Bradford method with Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Fresh feces (2-5 pellets/mouse) were collected before bacterial inoculation (week 0) and at necropsy (week 2), immediately snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C, for confirming colonization by qPCR. Unfractionated splenocytes were isolated from Il-10 +/eGFP (C57BL/6 background IL-10 -eGFP-reporter, IL-10-sufficient) mice, and 10 6 cells were incubated for 48 h at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in 200 μL of RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (Gibco, Invitrogen), 5 × 10 −5 mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) with or without individual bacterial lysates (100 μg/mL). The TLR9 ligand CpG-DNA (1 nM, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as positive control. Supernatants derived from the cell culture were collected for cytokine measurement by ELISA, while colonic lamina propria (LP) cells were processed, stained and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS), as described below. E. coli was used as the control Th1 non-inducing strain.
This protocol was performed with small local variations across laboratories located in UNC (USA), WIS (Israel), and KUSM (Japan). After sacrificing the mice, colonic tissue was harvested, longitudinally cut open and washed with cold sterile PBS. To remove the epithelial layer, tissues were incubated in HBSS and EDTA (5 mM) supplemented with HEPES (4 mM) at 37°C for 20 min, in shaking conditions (180 rpm). At UNC, 2.5% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM dithiothreitol, (Sigma) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) were also added to HBSS. Tissues were then washed and incubated in shaking conditions (180 rpm) for 30 min at 37°C in HBSS in presence of collagenase type II (0.5 mg/mL) and 3% FBS (Invitrogen). After incubation, the suspension was filtered through a 100 μm nylon mesh, cells were centrifuged down at 500 g for 10 min, and cell pellets were resuspended in reduced PBS.
In UNC and KUSM, after filtering, cells from lamina propria were purified using a 40–70% discontinuous Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare, 800 g, for 20 min, at room temperature). Cell count was performed at the microscope, to plate a total number of 5x10 5 cells in 96-well plates. Before intracellular staining, cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of Brefeldin, at 37°C for 5 h. In detail, cells were restimulated in WIS by using Cell Activation Cocktail (with Brefeldin A, Biolegend), or in KUSM, with 50 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) and 500 ng/mL ionomycin (Sigma) at room temperature, with 1 μL/mL protein transport inhibitor (GolgiStop, BD) during the last 3 h. After labeling live cells with a Fixable Viability dye, these were stained for surface staining for 30 min, then fixed with PFA 4% at room temp for 20 min, permeabilized and stained overnight at 4°C for IFN-γ, IL-17, RORγt or Foxp3 (antibodies are listed in the STAR Methods ). FACS data were collected by BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences), FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) or LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with Flowjo software (TreeStar).
IFN-γ and IL-10 were measured in conditioned media derived from colonic cells from lamina propria, and splenocytes cultures by ELISA, as previously described ( Mishima et al., 2015 75. Mishima, Y. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Hansen, J.J. ... Resident bacteria-stimulated IL-10-secreting B cells ameliorate T cell-mediated colitis by inducing Tr-1 cells that require IL-27-signaling Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2015; 1 :295-310 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), using mouse anti-IFN-γ and anti-IL-10 antibodies (BD Biosciences). The concentration was assessed in triplicates following manufacturer’s instructions, and comparing standard curves generated by the appropriate recombinant cytokine. In some experiments, the V-PLEX Plus Mouse Multiplexed ELISA Cytokine 19-Plex Kit (cat. no. K15255G) from Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD USA was utilized, in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. The kit is composed of two MULTISPOT® 96-well panels and utilizes sandwich immunoassay technology: the cytokine panel was coated with IL-9, MCP-1, IL-33, IL-27p28/IL-30, IL-15, IL-17A/F, MIP-1α, IP-10, and MIP-2 capture antibodies. Following washing with washing buffer, samples diluted 1:1 in diluent buffer or MSD standard were added to the wells. All samples and standards were run in duplicate. After 2 h incubation and a washing step, SULFO-TAG TM labeled detection antibody solution was added and the plates incubated for another 2 h. Following washing, MSD® Read Buffer T was added and plates were read immediately using a MESO® QuickPlex SQ 120. The standard curve was established by fitting the signals from the standard using a 4-parameter logistic model. Concentrations of samples were determined from the electrochemiluminescence signals by back-fitting to the standard curve and multiplied by the dilution factor. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis.
Male and female GF Rag1 −/− mice were infected with K. pneumoniae Kp-2H7 strain (5 × 10 9 CFU/mL, 200 μL). At day 1 post-infection, splenic effector T cells (CD4 + CD45RB high) were sorted from WT mice ( Eri et al., 2012 36. Eri, R. ∙ McGuckin, M.A. ∙ Wadley, R. T cell transfer model of colitis: a great tool to assess the contribution of T cells in chronic intestinal inflammation Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 844 :261-275 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 200 μL, at a 5 × 10 6 cells/mL concerntation, was retro-orbitally injected into mono-colonized Rag1 −/− mice, as previously described ( Powrie et al., 1994 89. Powrie, F. ∙ Leach, M.W. ∙ Mauze, S. ... Inhibition of Th1 responses prevents inflammatory bowel disease in scid mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi CD4+ T cells Immunity. 1994; 1 :553-562 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Successively, mice were gavaged with either phage combination (5 × 10 9 PFU/mL, 200 μL), or phage buffer (vehicle) three times a week. Mice were monitored for weight loss, and stool was plated to evaluate the effect of phages on targeting Kp. Animals were euthanized 6 weeks post T cell transfer, and histological analyses of colon, FACS, CFU and PFU counts were performed as previously described.
Mice were treated with 1.5% (w/v) DSS (M.W. = 36.000–50.000 Da; MP Biomedicals) in drinking water for 7 days, followed by regular access to water. Animals were weighed daily and monitored for signs of distress as well as rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy was performed on day 8 after beginning of DSS treatment. Mice were sacrificed for histological analysis at day 13. Mice received phages (200 μL of 5 × 10 9 PFU/mL), or phage buffer (vehicle), starting 4 days prior to DSS treatment and until the end of the experiment.
Distal colon portions were removed and fixed in buffered formaldehyde solution, 4%. Paraffin sections (5 μm) were stained with Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E), and colonic inflammation was then scored in a blinded fashion, as previously described ( Kim et al., 2005 55. Kim, S.C. ∙ Tonkonogy, S.L. ∙ Albright, C.A. ... Variable phenotypes of enterocolitis in interleukin 10-deficient mice monoassociated with two different commensal bacteria Gastroenterology. 2005; 128 :891-906 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Colonoscopy was performed using a high-resolution mouse video endoscopic system (Carl Storz). The severity of colitis was scored in a blinded manner using Murine Endoscopic Index of Colitis Severity, based on five parameters: granularity of mucosal surface; vascular pattern; translucency of the colon mucosa; visible fibrin; and stool consistency ( Becker, 2006 11. Becker, C. ∙ Fantini, M.C. ∙ Neurath, M.F. High resolution colonoscopy in live mice Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2900-2904 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Phage combinations were formulated by mixing the phages in equal quantities at a final concentration of 5 × 10 9 PFU/mL (MOI = 1) in phage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 pH = 7.5) supplemented with 2.6% (w/v) of NaHCO₃ prior to gavage. In GF mouse experiments, 200 μL of either phage vehicle or five phages targeting Kp were orally administered by gavage to GF mice three times a week, until sacrifice at day 14. In antibiotics-depeletion experiments, SPF WT mice previously treated with antibiotics (four days of tylosin, four days of ampicillin, two days of washout) and infected with Kp (5 × 10 9 CFU/mL, 200 μL), were gavaged with 200 μL of either phage vehicle, a single phage or phage combinations at the final concentration of 5 × 10 5 PFU/mL or 5 × 10 9 PFU/mL (MOI = 1), on day 6, 9 and 12.
Forty-one naturally-occurring (i.e., not genetically manipulated) phages were isolated from the environment and from clinical (dental and stool) samples. In detail, sewage samples were obtained from the National Virology Center at Sheba Hospital in Israel, and dental sewage was collected from the dental clinic at Poria Hospital in Israel. Fecal samples were provided by healthy donors at Sourasky Tel Aviv Medical Center. Phages were isolated by either direct spotting, or enrichment, followed by spotting, of the processed samples on a top agar lawn of Kp-2H7 or isolated mutants of Kp-2H7 bacteria, using the standard spotting plaque assay. Briefly, 5 μL of processed samples, or 5 μL of processed samples after a 24 h enrichment incubation together with Kp-2H7 or its isolated mutants, were spotted on a top agar layer of the target bacteria and cultured overnight at 37°C. After incubation, phage plaques were picked from the plate into medium followed by 2 additional rounds of isolation. Last, the serially isolated phage was then grown in liquid culture of Kp-2H7 (or one of its isolated mutants) at logarithmic stage. The characterization of the individual phages entailed sequencing, clustering by taxonomic analysis and genomic similarity, screening for the presence of genes encoding toxic and harmful proteins as well as profiling infectivity across Kp-2H7 strains and mutants. Host range analysis was performed by plaque assay on bacterial lawns of different Kp-2H7 strains, at a minimum of 2 biological and 2 technical replicates per experiment, for each stock of phage. The area outside the spotted phage region was used as control for growth of bacteria not exposed to phages.
Phages were sequenced and reads assembled using SPAdes 3.10.1 ( Bankevich et al., 2012 9. Bankevich, A. ∙ Nurk, S. ∙ Antipov, D. ... SPAdes: a new genome assembly algorithm and its applications to single-cell sequencing J. Comput. Biol. 2012; 19 :455-477 Crossref Scopus (13841) PubMed Google Scholar ). The assemblies were analyzed using PhageTerm 1.0.12 ( Garneau et al., 2017 43. Garneau, J.R. ∙ Depardieu, F. ∙ Fortier, L.-C. ... PhageTerm: a tool for fast and accurate determination of phage termini and packaging mechanism using next-generation sequencing data Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8292 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ) to finalize the genome and add terminal repeats, if detected. Prediction of ORFs and translation into amino acid sequences, in order to carry out taxonomic assignments or screening for genes, were performed on all assembled phage genomes by PATRIC ( Davis et al., 2020 26. Davis, J.J. ∙ Wattam, A.R. ∙ Aziz, R.K. ... The PATRIC Bioinformatics Resource Center: expanding data and analysis capabilities Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :D606-D612 PubMed Google Scholar ; Brettin et al., 2015 14. Brettin, T. ∙ Davis, J.J. ∙ Disz, T. ... RASTtk: a modular and extensible implementation of the RAST algorithm for building custom annotation pipelines and annotating batches of genomes Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :8365 Crossref Scopus (1358) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A screening was performed for undesirable genes in the phage genomes, using BLAST to compare phage genes, against a manually created database of toxic genes based on US CFR, title 40, section 725.421 (i.e., protein synthesis inhibitor, neurotoxins, oxygen labile cytolysins, toxins affecting membrane function, molecules affecting membrane integrity, cytotoxins). Other toxins or virulence genes were analyzed based on the PATRIC annotation pipeline. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes was analyzed using the NCBI AMRfinder tool with default parameters (version 3.6.15 with database version 2020-03-20.1) ( Feldgarden et al., 2019 41. Feldgarden, M. ∙ Brover, V. ∙ Haft, D.H. ... Validating the AMRFinder Tool and Resistance Gene Database by Using Antimicrobial Resistance Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in a Collection of Isolates Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2019; 63 :e00483-19 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), while evidence of potential lysogeny was tested by looking for phage integrases based on the latest Hidden Markov Models (HMM) in PFAM (version 33.1) ( El-Gebali et al., 2019 33. El-Gebali, S. ∙ Mistry, J. ∙ Bateman, A. ... The Pfam protein families database in 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D427-D432 Crossref Scopus (2647) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PANTHER ( Thomas et al., 2003 108. Thomas, P.D. ∙ Campbell, M.J. ∙ Kejariwal, A. ... PANTHER: a library of protein families and subfamilies indexed by function Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2129-2141 Crossref Scopus (2216) PubMed Google Scholar ) databases. Integrase domains were searched using HMMER version 3.3 ( Eddy 2011 32. Eddy, S.R. Accelerated profile HMM searches PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7 :e1002195 Crossref Scopus (3203) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, PHACTS v0.3 ( McNair et al., 2012 74. McNair, K. ∙ Bailey, B.A. ∙ Edwards, R.A. PHACTS, a computational approach to classifying the lifestyle of phages Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :614-618 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the more updated BACPHLIP v0.9.3 ( Hockenberry and Wilke 2020 47. Hockenberry, A.J. ∙ Wilke, C.O. BACPHLIP: Predicting bacteriophage lifestyle from conserved protein domains Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) were used to analyze the chances of virulent-only lifestyle of the phages.
The sequences of all 41 phages isolated against Kp-2H7, clinical bacterial isolates and resistant mutants were compared, using BLASTN, to a phage sequence database composed of genome sequences of all phages isolated in-house, and sequences of phages retrieved from NCBI. Thirty-seven of the 41 analyzed phages were part of eight different clusters (with a 90% similarity among phages in each cluster), while 3 remained as singletons. Each of these clusters was a subset of a different taxonomic group of phages ( Table S6 ). The taxonomy of the phages was assigned based on close genomic and proteomic relatedness to known phages with assigned taxonomies published by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and by NCBI RefSeq. Identification of the bacterial cell surface receptors (or genes important for their assembly) used by different phages was carried out by isolation and sequencing of resistant mutant bacteria, and detection of the responsible genomic modifications. Proteins carrying mutations of interest were identified using Breseq v0.30.2 ( Deatherage and Barrick 2014 28. Deatherage, D.E. ∙ Barrick, J.E. Identification of mutations in laboratory-evolved microbes from next-generation sequencing data using breseq Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1151 :165-188 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and profiled for their activity, pathway and relevance to already known phage receptors ( Figure 5 G). The designed phage combinations were tested in liquid medium for their ability to prevent the appearance of phage-resistant mutants when infecting liquid culture of Kp-2H7, and two representative clinical Kp2 isolates, CT-141-1 and CT-123-1. In detail, the bacterial host was grown until OD 600 = 0.2 in BHIS medium supplemented with 10 6 PFU/mL phages in different combinations of 3, 4 and 5 phages ( Figure S7 A), or vehicle (phage buffer). The growth curve was then monitored for 20 h at OD 600 by using a plate reader.
Samples were prepared for examination with TEM using negative staining method. Thawed samples were gently mixed and applied on freshly glow-discharged copper grids (400 mesh, formvar-carbon coated) for 5 min, washed and stained with one droplet of 1% (w/v) water solution of uranyl acetate. Two grids were prepared for each sample. The grids were observed by transmission electron microscope CM 100 (Philips, The Netherlands), operating at 80 kV. At least 10 grid squares were thoroughly examined, and micrographs (camera ORIUS SC 200) were taken coincidentally at different places on the grid.
All statistical analyses were performed using R (3.6.3), GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All statistical tests and values are included in Table S1 . Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, was used to test for differences in the taxonomical, functional, resistome and mobilome profiles. In all analyses, multiple testing correction was performed with Benjamini & Hochberg method. Incremental Area Under the Curve (iAUC) was computed on log 10 (abundance) and considering as baseline the abundance at the first day of phage treatment. Similarly, AUC was computed on log 10 (abundance), considering, as baseline, y = 0. Only mice with measurements in three time points after the baseline were included. When measurement at baseline was not available, the value was imputed by linear regression, considering the closest time points (before and after) initiation of phage therapy. As the distribution of AUC of log 10 (CFU/g) is not characterized in depth in literature, normality tests were performed for each dataset in order to apply parametric or non-parametric tests. The time-series analysis of ODs, CFU/g of stool, PFU, PFU/g stool and weight change were performed using lmer (linear mixed effect model and lmer test) accounting for the time, the treatment group and interaction of these factors. Mice or experimental conditions were used as a source of random variation, which resulted in the following equation: measurement (OD, CFU, PFU, weight change) = time × treatment group + (1 | mice, experimental condition).
