Title: Long-Term Expansion of Pancreatic Islet Organoids from Resident Procr + Progenitors


Abstract: Summary

It has generally proven challenging to produce functional β cells in vitro . Here, we describe a previously unidentified protein C receptor positive (Procr + ) cell population in adult mouse pancreas through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The cells reside in islets, do not express differentiation markers, and feature epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition characteristics. By genetic lineage tracing, Procr + islet cells undergo clonal expansion and generate all four endocrine cell types during adult homeostasis. Sorted Procr + cells, representing ∼1% of islet cells, can robustly form islet-like organoids when cultured at clonal density. Exponential expansion can be maintained over long periods by serial passaging, while differentiation can be induced at any time point in culture. β cells dominate in differentiated islet organoids, while α, δ, and PP cells occur at lower frequencies. The organoids are glucose-responsive and insulin-secreting. Upon transplantation in diabetic mice, these organoids reverse disease. These findings demonstrate that the adult mouse pancreatic islet contains a population of Procr + endocrine progenitors.

Section: Introduction

The pancreas consists of three main cellular components: endocrine islets, exocrine acini, and ducts. Pancreatic β cells of the islets of Langerhans are the only cells that produce insulin in humans as well as in almost all other vertebrates. In the mouse, the islet is organized into spherical structures in which β cells form a core surrounded by a mantle of α, δ, and PP cells. These cells produce insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP; Ppy), respectively ( Pan and Wright, 2011 34. Pan, F.C. ∙ Wright, C. Pancreas organogenesis: from bud to plexus to gland Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240 :530-565 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). β cells have a limited capacity for regeneration, a predisposing factor for the development of diabetes ( Hardikar, 2016 18. Hardikar, A.A. Pancreatic Islet Biology Springer International Publishing, 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ).
Cell therapy is considered as a potential therapeutic alternative to traditional treatments of diabetes. Islet and whole pancreas transplantations can restore glucose homeostasis by replenishing β cells ( Lysy et al., 2013 29. Lysy, P.A. ∙ Weir, G.C. ∙ Bonner-Weir, S. Making β cells from adult cells within the pancreas Curr. Diab. Rep. 2013; 13 :695-703 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Limitations in availability of donors have led to a search for strategies for generating β cells in vitro . Besides the use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs)/induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based technologies for the generation of transplantable β cells ( Cheng et al., 2012; Pagliuca et al., 2014; Rezania et al., 2014; Sneddon et al., 2012 7.

However, it has so far proven difficult to produce new β cells in culture from embryonic or adult pancreas, while the closely related enteroendocrine cells of the gut are readily generated in primary tissue-derived organoids ( Gehart et al., 2019 14.

Mouse embryonic pancreas progenitors, cultured under three-dimensional (3D) conditions, reflect exocrine and endocrine cell differentiation in vitro , yet do not support long-term expansion of pancreas cells ( Greggio et al., 2013; Sugiyama et al., 2013 16.

In this study, through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and knockin reporter mouse model, we identified a new cell population in adult mouse islets that express surface Procr. We interrogated these cells’ potential progenitor properties in vivo . Eventually, we established an in vitro culture system for the generation and long-term expansion of islet-like organoids.

Section: Results

Because Procr is a surface protein that has been reported to mark stem cells in several adult tissues, including the mammary gland ( Wang et al., 2015 50. Wang, D. ∙ Cai, C. ∙ Dong, X. ... Identification of multipotent mammary stem cells by protein C receptor expression Nature. 2015; 517 :81-84 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ), endothelium ( Yu et al., 2016 53.

Identification of blood vascular endothelial stem cells by the expression of protein C receptor Cell Res. 2016; 26 :1079-1098 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ), and hematopoietic systems ( Balazs et al., 2006; Fares et al., 2017; Iwasaki et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2016 3.

Zhou, F. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Wang, W. ... Tracing haematopoietic stem cell formation at single-cell resolution Nature. 2016; 533 :487-492 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), we searched for Procr + cells in murine islets using scRNA-seq. Pancreases from 8-week-old adult mice were dissociated and endocrine cells were enriched (see STAR Methods ). We profiled 7,160 cells using scRNA-seq approaches ( Figures 1 A and S1 A–S1C). Each cluster was mapped to endocrine cells (α, β, δ, and PP), exocrine cells (acinar and duct), or other known cell types (mesenchymal, endothelial, immune, and stellate) ( Figures 1 A, 1B, S1 D, and S1E). We found a cell cluster distinct from all other known cell populations ( Figure 1 A). This novel population displayed unique signature genes, including Rspo1 , Fgf1 , Upk3b , Hoxa5 , and Procr ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S1 F, and S1G), but did not express known endocrine or exocrine differentiation markers as shown by t -distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding ( t -SNE) plots ( Figures 1 B, S1 D, and S1G). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis identified enrichment of cell migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt pathway features ( Figure 1 E). The expression of the Wnt agonist gene Rspo1 and Wnt target gene Procr indicated enhanced Wnt pathway activity. The co-expression of epithelial markers ( EpCAM , Krt8 , and Cldn10 ) and mesenchymal markers ( Mmp2 , Col1a1 , and Vim ) supported the EMT characteristics of the new population ( Figure 1 F).
EMT is implicated in the formation of endocrine islets by committed endocrine precursor cells ( Rukstalis and Habener, 2007 40. Rukstalis, J.M. ∙ Habener, J.F. Snail2, a mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, expressed in progenitor cells of the developing endocrine pancreas Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7 :471-479 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lack of differentiation marker expression in the new population also suggests a potential precursor state. To gain insight into the nature of the new population, we integrated our data with published datasets of embryonic endocrine progenitors ( Byrnes et al., 2018; Scavuzzo et al., 2018 6. Byrnes, L.E. ∙ Wong, D.M. ∙ Subramaniam, M. ... Lineage dynamics of murine pancreatic development at single-cell resolution Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3922 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Scavuzzo, M.A. ∙ Hill, M.C. ∙ Chmielowiec, J. ... Endocrine lineage biases arise in temporally distinct endocrine progenitors during pancreatic morphogenesis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3356 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the new population seen in adult pancreas aligns with a cluster of Neurogenin3 (Ngn3) + cells at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) ( Figures S2 A and S2B). This E14.5 population also displayed EMT features, with combined expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers ( Figure S2 C), and shared a gene signature including Rspo1 , Fgf1 , Dcn , Upk3b , Hoxa5 , and Procr ( Figures S2 D and S2E). Interestingly, while the embryonic population was Ngn3 + , the adult counterpart was Ngn3 − ( Figure S2 F). These observations suggest that the adult Procr + cell has a counterpart cell population existing within the embryonic endocrine precursor cell population. Thus, we examined precursor-progeny relationships between the identified endocrine populations by pseudotemporal analysis using monocle 2 ( Qiu et al., 2017 36. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (2112) PubMed Google Scholar ). The analysis predicted two developmental trajectories (i.e., one toward β cell and another toward α cell) ( Figure 1 G).
To characterize this novel Procr + population, we micro-dissected islets and non-islet tissues. By negative selection for blood lineage cells and positive selection for epithelial cells, we separated islet cells into Procr + (Lin − , EpCAM + , Procr + ) and Procr − (Lin − , EpCAM + , Procr − ) populations by cell sorting ( Figure 2 A) and performed qPCR analysis. We found that a small population (1.0% ± 0.14%) of islet cells are Procr + ( Figures 2 A, S3 A, and S3B). Considering that rare mesenchymal, stellate, and endothelial cells (ECs) can express Procr as shown by scRNA-seq ( Figure 1 C), Procr + and Procr − cells were isolated from the non-islet tissue as well. qPCR analysis indicated that signature genes of the new population (e.g., Rspo1 , Fgf1 , Upk3b , Hoxa5 , Nkain4 , Lgals7 , Igfbp5 , and Igf1 ) are exclusively expressed in Procr + islet cells ( Figure 2 B).
We next analyzed Ngn3-Cre ; Rosa26-tdTomato mice, in which all endocrine lineages were marked in tdTomato, because they are all derived from embryonic Ngn3 + pancreatic endocrine precursors ( Gu et al., 2002 17. Gu, G. ∙ Dubauskaite, J. ∙ Melton, D.A. Direct evidence for the pancreatic lineage: NGN3+ cells are islet progenitors and are distinct from duct progenitors Development. 2002; 129 :2447-2457 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis confirmed that Procr + islet cells were all tdTomato + ( Figure S3 C), identifying the cells as progeny of Ngn3 + endocrine precursors. Notably, they appeared to represent a new type of progeny lacking the expression of differentiation markers of α, β, δ, and PP cells.
To visualize this population, we generated a double-reporter allele with a membrane GFP (mGFP)-2A-LacZ cassette inserted at the ATG of Procr ( Figures 2 C and S3 D–S3F). As shown by whole mount X-gal staining, Procr expression occurred in a small number of cells in a dispersed pattern in the islets ( Figure 2 D). mGFP + cells were further validated by Procr antibody using FACS ( Figure S3 G). Whole mount islet staining confirmed that mGFP + (Procr + ) cells do not express insulin (Ins), glucagon (Gcg), somatostatin (Sst), or pancreatic polypeptide (Ppy) ( Figure 2 E), yet co-express the epithelial marker EpCAM and the mesenchymal marker Col1a1 ( Figure 2 F), consistent with our scRNA-seq analysis.
To investigate the progenitor property of Procr + islet cells, we performed in vivo lineage tracing using Procr-CreERT2 knockin mice ( Wang et al., 2015 50. Wang, D. ∙ Cai, C. ∙ Dong, X. ... Identification of multipotent mammary stem cells by protein C receptor expression Nature. 2015; 517 :81-84 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Adult Procr-CreERT2;Rosa26-Confetti mice (8-week-old) were subjected to a low-dose tamoxifen (0.2 mg/25 g body weight) pulse, in order to achieve an efficiency of approximately one labeled cell per islet ( Figure 3 A). At 2 days post induction (dpi), individual islet cells were labeled with one of the confetti colors. Consistent with the results of scRNA-seq ( Figure 1 B) and Procr mGFP-2A-lacZ reporter ( Figure 2 E) analyses, these labeled cells were Ins − , Gcg − , Sst − , and Ppy − ( Figures 3 B and S3 H). At 3 months pi, clone sizes had increased ( Figures S3 I and S3J), with an average of 7.1 ± 0.2 cells/clone ( Figure S3 K). Approximately 70% of these clones showed coexistence of various endocrine lineages, such as clones containing β and α cells, β and δ cells, or β and PP cells ( Figures 3 C, 3E, S3 L, and S3M). The remaining 30% of the clones contained only β cells ( Figures 3 D, 3E, S3 L, and S3M). Clonal analysis quantified the cell numbers and cell types in each clone ( Figure 3 F). In all cases, at least one cell in each clone was negative for hormone staining (asterisk in Figures 3 C and 3D), which could potentially fuel further clonal expansion (i.e., the Procr + cell). Together, these results implied that Procr + islet cells are multipotent islet progenitors in adult pancreas, and new β, α, δ, and PP cells can be generated from these progenitors under physiological conditions.
Next, we investigated whether Procr + islet cells can serve as a cellular source for new β cells in vitro . Procr + islet cells were FACS-isolated and plated at clonal density in 3D culture with serum-free media and supplemented with growth factors including B27, ITS, EGF, heparin, and FGF2. While unsorted islet cells had a very low colony-forming efficiency (i.e., 1 colony formed out of 2,000 plated total cells), Procr + islet cells exhibited a 130-fold increase in clonogenicity (i.e., 1 out of 15 plated cells formed a colony) ( Figure S4 A). In contrast, Procr − islet cells were not able to form colonies ( Figures S4 A and S4B). However, colonies derived from either unsorted islet cells or Procr + islet cells could not be sustained for more than 7 days.
ECs, proposed as a critical niche component ( Lammert et al., 2001 26. Lammert, E. ∙ Cleaver, O. ∙ Melton, D. Induction of pancreatic differentiation by signals from blood vessels Science. 2001; 294 :564-567 Crossref Scopus (904) PubMed Google Scholar ), were therefore added in the culture of Procr + islet cells (see STAR Methods ). In this co-culture, Procr + islet cells exhibited robust colony forming ability (i.e., 1 colony formed per 4 plated Procr + cells). Colonies were readily observed from day 5 and reached an average of 145 μm diameter by day 8 ( Figure 4 A). In contrast, Procr − islet cells remained as single cells ( Figure 4 A). After continuous culture for 28 days, we observed the formation of more elaborate structures with large epithelial organoids in the center, surrounded and infiltrated by endothelial networks ( Figure 4 B). The average organoid sizes reached a diameter of 210 μm ( Figures 4 B and 4C), similar to the size of mouse islets in vivo .
Insulin expression was examined as an indication of functional β cell formation. Insulin staining was absent at day 7 and appeared at low levels at day 28 ( Figure 4 D). After glucose stimulation (12 h incubation with low glucose followed by 12 h treatment with high glucose for a total of 3 rounds, see STAR Methods ), Ins expression in day 28 organoids reached a level comparable to that of freshly isolated islets ( Figures 4 D and 4E). However, the same treatment only had modest effects on day 7 organoids, suggesting that prolonged culture is critical for β cell formation. Consistent with our interpretation, comparable results were obtained with staining for C-peptide ( Figures S4 C and S4D). As shown by qPCR analysis, the expression of key regulatory factors of β cells ( MafA , Ucn3 , and Pdx1 ) rose significantly in high-glucose-treated day 28 organoids, yet freshly isolated islets still scored better in this assay ( Figure 4 F). In day 28 organoids, cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations rapidly increased in response to glucose and subsequently returned to baseline ( Figure S4 E), indicating the capability of responding acutely to glucose ( Mohammed et al., 2009 31. Mohammed, J.S. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Harvat, T.A. ... Microfluidic device for multimodal characterization of pancreatic islets Lab Chip. 2009; 9 :97-106 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the day 28 organoids contained abundant endocrine granules ( Figures S4 F and S4G). Insulin expression was verified by Immunogold staining ( Figure S4 H). ELISAs confirmed the secretion of insulin and C-peptide in the media upon glucose stimulation of day 28 organoids, which are respectively 25% and 40% of the capacity of fresh islets ( Figures 4 G and 4H). In addition to an abundance of Ins + β-like cells, the organoids contained small numbers of Gcg + α-like, Sst + δ-like, and Ppy + PP-like cells ( Figures 4 I and 4J), reminiscent of the composition of fresh islets ( Figures 4 K and 4L). Thus, we established a culture system that harnesses the endocrine progenitor capacity of Procr + cells, allowing the generation of islet-like organoids in vitro . Cells within these organoids were capable of producing packaged insulin granules, of glucose sensing, and of insulin secretion.
To gain insights into the β-like cell differentiation process during organoid culture, we profiled day 7 (2,558 cells) and day 28 (1,613 cells) organoids by scRNA-seq ( Figure S4 I). We integrated the data with primary islet cells data and analyzed the transcriptional states arising during culture ( Figure 5 A). At day 7, six distinct organoid populations (Org.1–6) were identified. In addition to the existing Procr + cells, α-, δ-, and PP-like cells appeared, yet β-like cells remained absent ( Figure 5 A). At day 28, an additional cluster (Org.7) emerged, overlapping with primary β cells ( Figure 5 A). It should be noted that the contribution of Org.7 to the day 28 dataset is not quantitative. In order to capture all transition cell types and analyze the stepwise differentiation of β-like cells, we enriched the less mature cells before sequencing (see STAR Methods ), and thus the percentage of Org.7 in the day 28 dataset is likely an under-representation. To determine lineage progression toward β-like cells, we performed PCA of Procr + cells and the Org.1–7 clusters (7,196 cells) and observed a differentiation trajectory from Procr + cells to Org.1 and eventually to Org.7 (β-like cells) ( Figure 5 B). Heat-mapping of gene expression with cells ordered in pseudo-time revealed a temporal sequence of gene expression events during differentiation and identified many cells at intermediate stages ( Figure 5 C). Dot plotting illustrated gene signature shifts among different pseudo-time stages ( Figure 5 D). Notably, the expression of the Procr + cell signature declined from Org.2 onward, and β cell markers appeared from Org.4 onward ( Figures 5 C–5E). We also noticed that the proportion of Procr + cells decreased in both day 7 and day 28 culture compared to primary islet cells ( Figure 5 A). However, FACS analysis indicated that 1.4%–2.5% organoid cells still expressed Procr ( Figures S4 J and S4K). Considering that Org.1 most closely resembled the primary Procr + population ( Figures 5 C and 5D), we postulate that the expression of the Procr + cell signature switched to those of Org.1 in culture. Our single cell transcriptomic analyses thus allowed the construction of a differentiation trajectory through which Procr + progenitors generate β cells in culture.
Next, we sought to expand these organoids through passaging. Dissociated single cells were replated every 7–8 days at a ratio of 1:4–1:6 in the same culture condition, supplemented with fresh ECs (see STAR Methods ). In this culture system, the average organoid size remained stable during passaging ( Figures 6 A and 6B). However, the number of organoids expanded by 3- to 7-fold with each passage ( Figure 6 C). Organoids could be passaged at least 20 times, or 6 months, with no deceleration of the expansion rate ( Figure 6 C).
When these passaged organoids were taken out of the expansion cycle and allowed to mature for an additional 3 weeks (i.e., 28–30 days upon being replated as single cells) ( Figure 6 D), mature organoids resembled the primary organoids described above. 7 th and 15 th passage organoids are given as examples, showing similar percentages of α, β, δ, and PP cells ( Figures 6 E, 6F, S5 A, and S5B), glucose sensing, insulin and C-peptide secretion abilities, insulin granule numbers, and Ca 2+ response when compared to the primary passage organoids ( Figures 6 G–6I and S5 C–S5I). Organoid cultures maintained normal chromosome numbers over time ( Figures S5 J and S5K). These results implied that the expansion and differentiation capacities of the cells were maintained for long-term.
To test the full potential of the long-term cultured organoids, they were engrafted into the kidney capsule of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice, and the mice were monitored for glycemic improvement. 1,000 organoids (from the 7 th or 15 th passage, taken at day 7 of culture) or 300 freshly isolated islets, containing similar cell numbers (∼300,000 cells), were transplanted per recipient mouse. At 1 week post-transplantation, blood glucose levels were clearly reduced ( Figure 7 A), and body weight loss was stopped ( Figure S6 A). The glycemic improvement was maintained throughout the analysis period ( Figure 7 A). Notably, the organoid-transplanted groups exhibited similar rescue effects as the fresh islet-transplanted group ( Figure 7 A). At 1 month post-transplantation, mice transplanted with organoids exhibited glucose clearance ability and serum insulin levels almost identical to the mice receiving fresh islets ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Similar ameliorating effects were observed at 4 months post-transplantation ( Figure S6 B). Removal of the transplants by nephrectomy resulted in abrupt increase of blood glucose, confirming that the functional β cells reside in the kidney transplants ( Figure 7 A). Thus, the transplanted organoids were capable of secreting insulin and ameliorating progressive hyperglycemia in a diabetic mouse model.
The grafted organoid cells were excised and analyzed after 1 month and 4 months of transplantation. All four endocrine cell types were detected, with the vast majority being Ins + β cells ( Figures 7 D, 7E, and S6 C), similar to the grafted islet cells ( Figures S6 D and S6E). The host pancreases were also analyzed at 1 month and 4 months post-transplantation and no sign of recovery of β cell numbers was noted ( Figure S6 F). These observations further supported that the ameliorating effects were due to the grafted cells in the kidney. The identities of these cells were further analyzed by scRNA-seq. The grafted cells, after maturation in vivo , clustered with primary endocrine cells ( Figures 7 F and S7 A–S7C). In particular, the genes that encode islet cell markers, hormones, and transcriptional regulators were expressed at comparable levels between the primary mouse endocrine cells and the grafted organoid cells ( Figures 7 G, S7 D, and S7E).

Section: Discussion

In the current study, we identified a population of endocrine progenitor cells in adult mouse pancreas. These cells do not express known mature endocrine cell markers, feature EMT characteristic, and express Procr on their surface. In vivo , Procr + islet cells undergo clonal expansion and give rise to all four endocrine cell types during adult homeostasis. In vitro , isolated Procr + islet cells can grow at clonal density into islet-like organoids, which comprise all endocrine cell types and are capable of glucose-sensing and insulin secretion. These organoids can be exponentially expanded in vitro by serial passage over long time periods. These cultured islet-like organoids can reverse diabetes in vivo .
EMT plays a pivotal role during pancreatic islet formation. Committed endocrine precursor cells detach from the trunk epithelium, presumably via EMT, before the formation of the endocrine islets ( Rukstalis and Habener, 2007 40. Rukstalis, J.M. ∙ Habener, J.F. Snail2, a mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, expressed in progenitor cells of the developing endocrine pancreas Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7 :471-479 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has also been proposed that, at later stages, ductal cells can serve as facultative endocrine progenitors, which is thought to happen through reawakening of the embryonic EMT process ( Al-Hasani et al., 2013 2. Al-Hasani, K. ∙ Pfeifer, A. ∙ Courtney, M. ... Adult duct-lining cells can reprogram into β-like cells able to counter repeated cycles of toxin-induced diabetes Dev. Cell. 2013; 26 :86-100 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under specific culture conditions, β cells can undergo EMT and dedifferentiate to lose their mature characteristics. The resultant fibroblast-like cells can be extensively expanded and re-differentiate into endocrine cell types ( Gershengorn et al., 2004; Ouziel-Yahalom et al., 2006; Russ et al., 2008 15.

In vitro proliferation of cells derived from adult human beta-cells revealed by cell-lineage tracing Diabetes. 2008; 57 :1575-1583 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the current study, we identified a population of cells in healthy adult islets that appear to be in a partial EMT state, co-expressing epithelial markers and mesenchymal markers. Intriguingly, a counterpart cell population also appears to exist within the embryonic endocrine precursor cell population, with similar EMT characteristic and shared signature genes such as Procr , Rspo1 , Hoxa 5, and Dcn , etc. The Ngn3 + endocrine precursor represents a transient cell type in the embryonic pancreas. While the majority of Ngn3 endocrine precursors lose their precursor state after maturation into endocrine cells, it appears that a subpopulation is retained in a pro-endocrine progenitor state post organogenesis. This subpopulation no longer expresses Ngn3, but it retains EMT features and the indicated signature genes. Using Ngn3 - Cre mediated lineage tracing, we confirmed that Procr + cells (endocrine progenitors) descend from Ngn3 + endocrine precursors.
By genetic lineage tracing experiments using RIP (rat insulin promoter)- CreER , it has been suggested that new β cells arise predominantly from replication of pre-existing β cells in uninjured condition ( Dor et al., 2004 9. Dor, Y. ∙ Brown, J. ∙ Martinez, O.I. ... Adult pancreatic beta-cells are formed by self-duplication rather than stem-cell differentiation Nature. 2004; 429 :41-46 Crossref Scopus (1972) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this does not exclude the possible existence and action of stem/progenitor cells, because not all RIP-CreER -expressing cells are functional β cells ( Jiang and Morahan, 2014; Liu et al., 2010; Smukler et al., 2011 22.

The adult mouse and human pancreas contain rare multipotent stem cells that express insulin Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8 :281-293 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, Procr-CreERT2 tracing experiments, we provided direct evidence that the adult pancreas contains a population of Procr + islet multipotent endocrine progenitors that contribute to neogenesis of β cells, as well as α, δ, and PP cells, during homeostasis. It is important to note that generation of β cells from Procr + progenitors and β cell replication are not mutually exclusive. It is plausible that Procr + progenitors generate daughter β cells, and these β cells undergo further replication. Different mechanisms have been proposed for β cells mass increase, and some involve plasticity of various pancreatic cell types ( Aguayo-Mazzucato and Bonner-Weir, 2018 1. Aguayo-Mazzucato, C. ∙ Bonner-Weir, S. Pancreatic β Cell Regeneration as a Possible Therapy for Diabetes Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :57-67 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). One such cell type is the “virgin β cell,” which expresses Ins but not Ucn3 ( van der Meulen et al., 2017 49. van der Meulen, T. ∙ Mawla, A.M. ∙ DiGruccio, M.R. ... Virgin Beta Cells Persist throughout Life at a Neogenic Niche within Pancreatic Islets Cell Metab. 2017; 25 :911-926 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is noteworthy that these “virgin β cells” and Procr + cells both exist in the periphery of the islet. However, they are very different: (1) “virgin β cells” are Ucn3 − , MafB + , Ins + , while Procr + cells are Ucn3 − , MafB − , Ins − ; and (2) their differentiation potency is different. “Virgin β cells” represent an intermediate stage between α cells and β cells, with the potential to become β cells. In contrast, Procr+ cells can expand and generate all four endocrine cell types. In another study, “intra islet duct cells,” analyzed by lineage tracing using Sox9-CreER , give rise to new β cells, but not to other endocrine cell types ( El-Gohary et al., 2016 10. El-Gohary, Y. ∙ Wiersch, J. ∙ Tulachan, S. ... Intraislet Pancreatic Ducts Can Give Rise to Insulin-Positive Cells Endocrinology. 2016; 157 :166-175 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, there is growing body of evidence for the existence of a pancreas progenitor pool within the ductal tree of the adult pancreas. Severe damage to the pancreas can stimulate non-endocrine precursors, such as duct cells, to proliferate and differentiate toward acinar ( Criscimanna et al., 2011; Furuyama et al., 2011 8. Criscimanna, A. ∙ Speicher, J.A. ∙ Houshmand, G. ...

Beta cells can be generated from endogenous progenitors in injured adult mouse pancreas Cell. 2008; 132 :197-207 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (843) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, Procr is also expressed in compartments outside the islet, including ECs, mesenchymal cells, as well as exocrine tissues. While we cannot rule out the ductal tree as an alternative source of Procr + cells (in homeostasis or upon severe injury), in the current study, we analyze Procr + endocrine progenitors that physically reside in the islets.
Identifying a reservoir of endocrine progenitor cells in the pancreas allows for either in situ or ex vivo expansion approaches to increase β cell mass. The current study explores the latter. We harness the expansion and differentiation capacities of the endocrine progenitors. Through co-culture with ECs, a strategy that has been employed in growing organoids of other tissues ( Lee et al., 2014; Takebe et al., 2015 27. Lee, J.H. ∙ Bhang, D.H. ∙ Beede, A. ...

Takebe, T. ∙ Enomura, M. ∙ Yoshizawa, E. ... Vascularized and Complex Organ Buds from Diverse Tissues via Mesenchymal Cell-Driven Condensation Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16 :556-565 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ), we establish a culture system for the expansion and induction of the islet-like organoids. The resulting organoids are dominated by β cells and surrounded by a mantle of α, δ, and PP cells. We demonstrate these organoids to be a useful cell source for ameliorating diabetes in a mouse model. Increasing evidence indicates that proper glucose regulation requires coordination between the various islet cell types ( Johnston et al., 2016; van der Meulen et al., 2017 24. Johnston, N.R. ∙ Mitchell, R.K. ∙ Haythorne, E. ... Beta cell hubs dictate pancreatic islet responses to glucose. Cell Metab. 2016; 24 :389-401 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar 49. van der Meulen, T. ∙ Mawla, A.M. ∙ DiGruccio, M.R. ... Virgin Beta Cells Persist throughout Life at a Neogenic Niche within Pancreatic Islets Cell Metab. 2017; 25 :911-926 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). It may therefore be advantageous to produce whole islets in vitro rather than to differentiate cells into a specific cell type.
Several immediate questions arise from our study. What is the nature of the signals that emanate from the ECs? Whether human islets contain a counterpart progenitor population? Whether they express similar signature genes? Undoubtedly, the translation of the culture system to human cells will require further work, e.g., identifying defined growth factors to replace the supportive signals from the ECs.
In summary, this study identifies a novel endocrine progenitor in adult mouse pancreas and establishes an in vitro method for the induction and long-term expansion of islet-like organoids. This progenitor population may be explored for their existence in human and for treatment of diabetes.

All the animal experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (SIBCB), Chinese Academy of Sciences, with a project license number of IBCB0065. Both male and female mice with 8-20 weeks old were used in this study. Mice were housed in the SIBCB animal facility under SPF conditions with a 12 hr light/dark cycle at room temperature in accordance with the institutional guidelines and ethical regulations, and fed with regular chow and water by the facility staff. The Procr mGFP-2A-LacZ mouse line was generated by knocking in a cassette of mGFP-2A-LacZ behind start codon of the Procr gene. The targeting construct, Southern blot validation and genotyping methods were shown in Figure S3 . For the lineage tracing of Ngn3 + cells, the Ngn3-Cre (JAX#006333) mice were crossed to the Rosa26-tdTomato (JAX#007909) reporter mice. For the lineage tracing of Procr + cells, the Procr-CreERT2 (JAX#033052) mice were crossed to the Rosa26-confetti (JAX#017492) reporter mice. For the in vitro co-culture experiments, the Procr + islet cells and the endothelial cells were isolated from the wild-type ICR (SLAC), FVB (SLAC), C57BL/6 (SLAC) and Actin-dsRed (JAX#006051) mice. The Nude (SLAC) mice were used for the kidney capsule transplantation experiments, mice with the same sex were randomly assigned to experimental groups.
Mouse pancreas was perfused by injection of 2-4 mL digestion buffer (RPMI 1640 medium containing type IV collagenase (1000-1500 U ml -1 ), 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) and 25 mM HEPES) from the common duct. The pancreas was then dissected carefully to keep the integrity of the perfused tissue and then incubated at 37°C for 5-6 min followed by gently shaking for 3-6 min. The proper perfusion and digestion time are critical for the islets yield and structure integrity. After digestion, the tissue was suspended in 20 mL HBSS with 10% FBS and rigorously shook up and down for 40 times within 20 s, followed by HBSS wash for 2 times. The digested tissue was then filtered with 500 μm cell strainers. To enrich islets, the filtered sample underwent density gradient centrifugation or was transferred under the microscope for hand-picking of islets. To prepare the density gradient centrifugation, the tissue was first re-suspended in 10 mL histopaque-1077 and slowly covered by 10 mL HBSS without breaking the interface. Then centrifuge at 2,400 rpm for 22 min with the slowest acceleration and breaking to obtain the enriched islets compartment at the HBSS/histopaque-1077 interface. After the initial density gradient centrifugation step, the purity of islets ranged from 20% to 70%, depending on the quality of earlier perfusion and digestion process. To enhance the purity of islets, the samples were re-suspended in HBSS with 10% FBS for hand-pick. Islets with high purity were obtained by hand-pick under dissecting microscope for at least 3 rounds.
X-gal staining of purified islets was performed following the standard protocol with minor changes. In brief, islets were fixed in Fix A solution (1% Formaldehyde, 0.2% Glutaraldehyde, 0.02% NP-40 in PBS) at 4°C for 30 min, washed with PBS for 3 times, then stained in X-gal staining solution (1 mg ml -1 X-gal, 5 mM K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ], 5 mM K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ], 2 mM MgCl 2 in PBS) at room temperature for 5 hr. After staining, islets were washed with PBS and the whole mount images were captured by Zeiss inverted microscope.
To prepare samples for frozen sections, the dissected pancreas was fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C for 4 hr, washed with PBS for 3 times and then embedded with Optimum Cutting Temperature (OCT). Tissue sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, followed by washing in PBST (PBS+0.1% Triton X-100), incubation with secondary antibodies and DAPI for 2 hr at room temperature, then sections were washed and mounted for confocal imaging.
To perform whole mount staining, islets or cultured organoids were fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C for 1 hr, followed by 3 times of PBS washing, then blocked with the whole mount blocking buffer at room temperature for 1hr. The blocking buffer contained 10% FBS in PBST. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated at 4°C overnight, after washing with PBST for 3 times, the secondary antibodies and DAPI were incubated at 4°C overnight. Islets or organoids were then washed and mounted with mounting medium for confocal imaging.
All confocal images were captured by Leica SP8 confocal detection system fitted on a Leica DMI6000 microscope.
Purified islet samples were treated with 2 mL 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37°C for 4 min, followed by digestion with 0.1 mg ml -1 DNase I for 4 min, with gently pipetting for about 20 times. The digested cells were filtered through 70 μm cell strainer.
For FACS analysis and cell sorting, antibody incubation was performed on ice for 25 min in HBSS with 5% FBS at a dilution of 1:200. All analysis and sorting experiments were performed using FACS Jazz (Becton Dickinson). The purity of the sorted population was routinely checked and ensured to be more than 95%.
Cd31 + endothelial cells (ECs) were FACS-isolated from inguinal fat pad or skin of wild-type or Actin-dsRed mice. In detail, minced fat pad or skin were digested in digestion buffer (RPMI 1640 medium containing type III collagenase (300 U ml -1 ), 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) and 25 mM HEPES) for 1 hr. After lysis of the red blood cells, a single-cell suspension was obtained by sequential incubation with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37°C for 5 min and 0.1 mg ml -1 DNase I (Sigma) for 5 min with gentle pipetting, followed by filtration through 70 μm cell strainers. Subsequently, endothelial cells were collected by FACS sorting using Cd31 antibody. The mouse islet EpCAM + , Procr +/− cells were FACS-sorted from hand-picked islets of wild-type ICR, C57BL/6 or FVB mice as described above.
Before plating, each well of 48-well was coated with 200 μL Matrigel, the plate was transferred into 37°C incubator for Matrigel gelification. The sorted islet cells and ECs were centrifuged and re-suspended in mouse organoid culture medium (DMEM/F12 plus 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 2% B27, 1% ITS, 50 ng ml -1 EGF, 2 μg ml -1 heparin, 10 ng ml -1 FGF2 and 5 ng ml -1 VEGFa). Islet cells and ECs were mixed in a cell number ratio of 1:3, and plated into the coated 48-wells.
The medium was refreshed every 2-3 days. In order to induce β cell maturation, glucose challenges were performed. 20 mM glucose in HBSS was mixed with the organoid medium in a ratio of 1:1 to prepare high glucose medium, in which the final glucose concentration is 12.5 mM. Organoids were first cultured for 12 hr in low glucose (5 mM) medium followed by 12 hr treatment in high glucose (12.5 mM) medium for 3 rounds in total.
Organoids were passaged every 7-8 days, occasionally as late as every 14 days. For passage, organoids were released from the Matrigel using dispase (37°C for 40 min) and dissociated into single cells with 1 mL 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (37°C for 6-9 min). Due to the expansion of islet cells in culture, the percentage of Cd31 + ECs at the end of primary passage was about 2%–6% of total cells (by FACS quantification), which was not sufficient to support the organoid expansion in the subsequent passage. Therefore, during each passage, the digested single cell suspension was replenished with freshly isolated Cd31 + ECs in a cell number ratio of 1:1, and then the mixture was re-plated in a split ratio of 1:4-1:6.
About 100 mouse organoids (at day 28 culture) or 30 fresh islets (handpicked islets of relatively uniform large size and round shape, which are about 300 μm in diameter), both containing similar numbers of cells, were used. The organoids or islets were first washed with Krebs buffer for 3 times, then pre-incubated in low glucose (2 mM) for 2 hr to remove residual insulin. Subsequently, the organoids were washed for 2 times in Krebs buffer followed by incubation in low-glucose for 30 min, and the supernatant samples were collected. Subsequently, the organoids were washed 2 times in Krebs buffer followed by incubation in high glucose (20 mM) for 30 min, and the supernatant samples were collected. This process was repeated for two additional times. Insulin/C-peptide levels contained in the supernatant samples were analyzed using mouse Ultrasensitive Insulin/C-peptide ELISA kit following standard protocols.
To prepare samples for TEM, organoids or islets were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4°C overnight and post-fixed in 2% aqueous osmium tetraoxide at 4°C for 1.5 hr, then dehydrated in gradual ethanol (30% to 100%) and propylene oxide, embedded in Epon812 and cured for 48 hr at 60°C. 50 nm ultrathin sections were collected onto 200 mesh copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate (10 min) and lead citrate (5 min) before examination by transmission electron microscopy.
For immunogold staining, organoids or islets cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 2-3 hr and treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 40 min before sample preparation.
Images were captured with FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Transmission electron microscope.
Organoids were harvested after dispase dissociation and plated in 35 mm glass bottom dish without Matrigel for 24 hr. The cell clusters were washed with Krebs buffer for 2 times and incubated with Fluo4-AM for 30 min. Afterward, Fluo4-AM was washed out with Krebs buffer, and the cell clusters were incubated in 37°C for an additional 15 min without the dye. The cell clusters were then staged on Nikon AI inverted confocal microscope for the acquisition of high-resolution time series images. Time series images were acquired every 10 s. Progression of glucose challenges and time of stimulation during imaging was as follows: 5 min in low glucose (2 mM), Krebs wash, 5 min in high glucose (20 mM), Krebs wash. This sequential treatment was repeated for two more times, and then a final incubation for 5 min with 2 mM glucose containing 30 mM KCl was performed. For the measurement of the average fluorescence intensity, images were quantified by Imaris software (v8.2.0).
Early (2 nd ) and late (15 th ) passaged organoids were harvested at day 5-7 in culture, a phase with robust proliferation, followed by incubation for 20 hr with 1 μg ml -1 nocodazole. Then, organoid cells were dissociated into single cells and processed using standard karyotyping protocols. In detail, cells were incubated in 0.075 M KCl for 20 min and fixed with Carnoy’s Fixative (3:1 ratio of methanol: glacial acetic acid) for 25 min, for 3 times in total. Then, cells were dropped onto slides and air-dried, followed by treatment with 0.05% trypsin for 1 min and staining with DAPI for 2 min before mounting.
Nude recipients were induced diabetes with a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 160 mg per kg in pH 4.5 citrate buffer) 7 days prior to engraft. Nonfasted blood glucose was measured from tail vein samples with a OneTouch glucometer to select the diabetic recipients with blood glucose level increased to about 20 mM. 300 mouse islets or 1,000 organoids (7 th or 15 th passage, at day 7 culture) were engrafted underneath the kidney capsule of recipient mice. Nonfasted blood glucose and body weight were routinely measured after engrafting for 1 month and 4 months. Glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) were performed following standard protocol. In brief, mice were fasted overnight and received an intraperitoneal injection of 2 g per kg body weight glucose, blood glucose levels were measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after glucose challenges. Serum samples before and after glucose injection were also collected and measured by ELISA. Recipients were sacrificed 1 month or 4 months after engrafting, and the grafted tissues were harvested for section and endocrine markers staining or digested into single cells for 10X sc RNA-sequencing. The recipients’ pancreatic islets were also harvested and stained with insulin antibody, ensuring the enduring effect of β cell ablation by STZ, and the glycemic amelioration was not affected by any potential islet regeneration in the pancreas. At 4 months after engrafting, nephrectomy was also performed to examine the impact of removing the grafted organoids or islets to the glycemic amelioration.
RNA isolation of primary cells or organoids were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were lysed in RNAiso plus. Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Primerscript RT master kit. qPCR samples were prepared with SYBR Green Mixture and detected using Applied Biosystems Stepone Plus machine. All the qPCR primers were listed in Table S1 .
For the primary pancreatic scRNA-seq, 3 biological replicates were performed, ICR mice were used in replicate-1 and replicate-2, C57BL/6 mice were used in replicate-3. We enriched islets by density gradient centrifugation as described above, and skipped islet hand-picking purification step in order to minimize the damage of exocrine enzymes released during tissue dissociation (The islet hand-picking process took at least 1 hr at room temperature). Alternatively, TSQ (6-methoxy-8-p-toluenesulfonamido-quilone) was used to enrich endocrine cells by FACS sorting ( Huch et al., 2013 19. Huch, M. ∙ Bonfanti, P. ∙ Boj, S.F. ... Unlimited in vitro expansion of adult bi-potent pancreas progenitors through the Lgr5/R-spondin axis EMBO J. 2013; 32 :2708-2721 Crossref Scopus (530) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cells were re-suspended in a solution containing TSQ (0.2 mg ml -1 ). After FACS sorting, the endocrine (TSQ + ) and non-endocrine (TSQ − ) compartments were mixed together at a 1:1 ratio as one sequencing sample. 13,000 single cells were loaded, with a recovery of 3,706, 2,349 and 1,111 cells respectively for each biological replicate. We were aware that the output ratio between endocrine and non-endocrine compartments was higher than 1:1. This may due to the relative larger size of acinar cells, leading to their under-representativeness in numbers using the 10X method.
To analyze the β cell maturation process in organoid culture, day 7 or day 28 glucose-stimulated organoids cells were dissociated into single cells with 0.05% trypsin for sequencing. Based on marker expression and Insulin/C-peptide staining in Figures 4 and S4 , we predicted that the day 28 organoids contained high percentage of β-like cells. To capture all transition cell population, we enhanced the proportion of less mature cells by FACS sort. In day 28 organoids, Cd31 + ECs were gated out, and both TSQ − and TSQ + cells were collected. TSQ − and TSQ + cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio before loading. 13,000 single cells were loaded for each experiment, with a recovery of 4,008 cells for the day 7 organoid sample and 2,240 cells for the day 28 organoid sample.
To retrieve the grafted cells for sequencing, we carefully dissected the transplant from the kidney, followed by mincing and digestion with 0.05% trypsin and DNase I. Dissociated single cells underwent FACS sort for TSQ + cells, which underwent sequencing and subsequently were compared with primary mouse islet cells. 13,000 engrafted cells pooled from 3 recipient mice (1 mouse transplanted with 7th organoid and 2 mice with 15th organoid) were loaded, with a recovery of 2,129 cells.
For all of the single cell experiments, the cell qualities were checked under the microscope before loading onto the chip and cell viability was ensured to be higher than 75%, with over 90% of cells ensured as singlets before loading. For the library preparation, single cells were loaded onto 3’ library chips for the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library (v2) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (10X Genomics). In brief, single cells were partitioned into gel beads in emulsion in the GemCode instrument with cell lysis and barcoded reverse transcription of RNA, followed by amplification, shearing, and 5’ adaptor and sample index attachment. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq PE150 or X-ten.
Filtering, alignment to the mm10 transcriptome and unique molecular identifier (UMI)-collapsing were performed using the Cell Ranger (v2) pipeline with default mapping arguments (10X Genomics).
Cell filtering: we used the Seurat 3 R package for data integration, analysis and visualization ( Butler et al., 2018 5. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6218) PubMed Google Scholar ). To create Seurat object, genes which expressed in at least 2 cells and cells which had at least 300 detected genes and 1,500 detected UMIs were selected. Therefore, 6 cells were filtered from replicate-3 of primary pancreatic sample (from 1,111 cells to 1,105 cells), 1,221 cells were filtered from day 7 organoid sample (from 4,008 to 2,787) and 2 cells were filtered from day 28 organoid sample (from 2,240 cells to 2,238 cells). In the analyses involved the E14.5 Ngn3 + single cell RNA-seq data from Byrnes et al. (2018) 6. Byrnes, L.E. ∙ Wong, D.M. ∙ Subramaniam, M. ... Lineage dynamics of murine pancreatic development at single-cell resolution Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3922 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar and Scavuzzo et al. (2018) 42. Scavuzzo, M.A. ∙ Hill, M.C. ∙ Chmielowiec, J. ... Endocrine lineage biases arise in temporally distinct endocrine progenitors during pancreatic morphogenesis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3356 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar , the same filtering standards were used for the Seurat objects creation, Ngn3 + cells were further subset by the Neurog3 UMI > 0.
PCs selection: the differentially expressed genes were found by “vst” method and the top 2,000 differentially expressed genes were selected for PCA analysis. PCs selection was based on an elbow plot. 20 PCs were used for primary pancreatic cells, primary pancreatic cells V.S. engrafted cells or primary pancreatic cells V.S. organoid cells. 16 PCs were used for primary pancreatic cells V.S. E14.5 Ngn3 + cells. In each analysis, more PCs were also tested for t -SNE projection, and we did not see changes of cell distribution and clustering.
Dimensional reduction, cell clustering and data display: dimensional reduction was performed with the t -stochastic neighboring embedding method ( t -SNE). Cell clustering was based on shared-nearest neighbor (SNN) method and the resolution were set to 0.9 for primary pancreatic cells and primary pancreatic cells V.S. engrafted cells, 2.5 for primary pancreatic cells V.S. Organoid cells and 1.8 for primary pancreatic cells V.S. E14.5 Ngn3 + cells. Then clusters were put together as one cell type based on the similarity of the expression profiles and the marker genes expression. After cell type annotation, for better illustration, the non-relevant cell types such as immune, mesenchymal, stellate and endothelial cells were not included for some data display. Violin plots, heatmaps, dot plots and individual t -SNE plots for the given genes were generated by using the Seurat toolkit VlnPlot, DoHeatmap, DotPlot and FeaturePlot functions, respectively. Of note, in the primary pancreatic cells datasets, the endothelial population displayed over 50% of doublets identified by DoubletFinder, and should be used with caution for future EC-related analysis.
Pseudotemporal analysis of primary pancreatic cells: Monocle 2 R package ( Qiu et al., 2017 36. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (2112) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for pseudotemporal analysis of the primary pancreas cells. The α, β, δ, PP and new population cells identified by Seurat were imported to monocle 2 for the creation of monocle 2 CellDataSet object. In monocle 2 analysis, we only kept cells with at least 1,500 detected genes to ensure high data quality, therefore 321 cells were further filtered (including 10 cells in the new pop.). As the cell type information were also transferred from Seurat, we did not need to go through the entire workflow of monocle 2 to re-identify differential expression genes for clustering, cell type identification and the trajectory construction. Instead, the top 2,000 variable genes identified by Seurat were used as the ordering genes as these genes were proved efficient to clearly distinguish the differences between cells in the previous analysis. Indeed, after setting the ordering filter using the Seurat top 2,000 variable genes, we performed “plot_ordering_genes” analysis, and found that these selected 2,000 genes were suitable for trajectory analysis. We used the “DDRTree” method for dimensional reduction and set the “max_components” to 2 to generate one branching point.
Paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests were performed when two groups of samples were compared. One-way or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s or Dunnett’s tests were performed when multiple groups were compared. All the p values were calculated using GraphPad PRISM 6 with the following significance: n.s. p > 0.05; ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001. Statistical details for each experiment can be found in the figures and the legends.
