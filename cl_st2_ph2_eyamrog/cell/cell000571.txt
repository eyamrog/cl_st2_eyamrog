Title: Tumor-reactive antibodies evolve from non-binding and autoreactive precursors


Abstract: Summary

The tumor microenvironment hosts antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) associated with a favorable prognosis in several types of cancer. Patient-derived antibodies have diagnostic and therapeutic potential; yet, it remains unclear how antibodies gain autoreactivity and target tumors. Here, we found that somatic hypermutations (SHMs) promote antibody antitumor reactivity against surface autoantigens in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Patient-derived tumor cells were frequently coated with IgGs. Intratumoral ASCs in HGSOC were both mutated and clonally expanded and produced tumor-reactive antibodies that targeted MMP14, which is abundantly expressed on the tumor cell surface. The reversion of monoclonal antibodies to their germline configuration revealed two types of classes: one dependent on SHMs for tumor binding and a second with germline-encoded autoreactivity. Thus, tumor-reactive autoantibodies are either naturally occurring or evolve through an antigen-driven selection process. These findings highlight the origin and potential applicability of autoantibodies directed at surface antigens for tumor targeting in cancer patients.

Section: Introduction

Antigen-driven selection of B cells bearing high-affinity antibodies for clonal expansion and differentiation in germinal centers (GCs) in response to infection or vaccination has been extensively studied ( Victora and Nussenzweig, 2022 70. Victora, G.D. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Germinal centers Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2022; 30 :429-457 Google Scholar ). In cancer patients, autoreactive antibodies are frequently present, suggesting that a breach of self-tolerance takes place, as observed in autoimmune diseases ( Zaenker et al., 2016 83. Zaenker, P. ∙ Gray, E.S. ∙ Ziman, M.R. Autoantibody production in cancer—the humoral immune response toward autologous antigens in cancer patients Autoimmun. Rev. 2016; 15 :477-483 Google Scholar ). Yet, our knowledge regarding the cellular mechanisms underlying the production of tumor-reactive autoantibodies and their cell surface antigens remains elusive. Intratumoral antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and their B cell precursors were described in many types of solid tumors, and the presence of B-cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) was robustly associated with a superior prognosis and was shown to predict a beneficial response to immunotherapy treatments ( Petitprez et al., 2020 52.

Intratumoral B cells can support an antitumor immune response through several mechanisms, including antigen presentation to T cells ( Cui et al., 2021 18. Cui, C. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Fagerberg, E. ... Neoantigen-driven B cell and CD4 T follicular helper cell collaboration promotes robust anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses Cell. 2021; 184 :6101-6118.e13 Google Scholar ) and differentiation to ASCs that secrete self-reactive and tumor-specific antibodies ( Sharonov et al., 2020 64.

Intratumoral B cells and ASCs are frequently observed in ovarian tumors ( Nelson, 2010 48. Nelson, B.H. CD20+ B cells: the other tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes J. Immunol. 2010; 185 :4977-4982 Google Scholar ; Montfort et al., 2017 45. Montfort, A. ∙ Pearce, O. ∙ Maniati, E. ... A strong B-cell response is part of the immune landscape in human high-grade serous ovarian metastases Clin. Cancer Res. 2017; 23 :250-262 Google Scholar ). In this desmoplastic cancer, the tumor mass, its highly fibrotic microenvironment, and metastatic cells are constantly in contact with ascites fluids that accumulate antibodies that are produced by ASCs in the tumor microenvironment ( Rao and Hanjani, 1988 58. Rao, G.S. ∙ Hanjani, P. Detection of human ovarian tumor-associated antigens by antibodies isolated from ovarian carcinoma ascitic fluid Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1988; 159 :94-98 Google Scholar ; Silburn et al., 1984 65. Silburn, P.A. ∙ Khoo, S.K. ∙ Hill, R. ... Demonstration of tumor-associated immunoglobulin G isolated from immune complexes in ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer Diagn. Immunol. 1984; 2 :30-35 Google Scholar ). Since these tumor-associated fluids are very accessible, this type of cancer is ideal for the analysis of the antitumor humoral immune response ( Rao and Hanjani, 1988 58. Rao, G.S. ∙ Hanjani, P. Detection of human ovarian tumor-associated antigens by antibodies isolated from ovarian carcinoma ascitic fluid Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1988; 159 :94-98 Google Scholar ; Silburn et al., 1984 65. Silburn, P.A. ∙ Khoo, S.K. ∙ Hill, R. ... Demonstration of tumor-associated immunoglobulin G isolated from immune complexes in ascitic fluid of ovarian cancer Diagn. Immunol. 1984; 2 :30-35 Google Scholar ). High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most prevalent subtype of ovarian cancer ( Bowtell, 2010 12. Bowtell, D.D.L. The genesis and evolution of high-grade serous ovarian cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10 :803-808 Google Scholar ; Ramalingam, 2016 56. Ramalingam, P.

Jayson, G.C. ∙ Kohn, E.C. ∙ Kitchener, H.C. ... Ovarian cancer Lancet. 2014; 384 :1376-1388 Google Scholar ), and its treatment generally includes a combination of chemotherapy and surgery, whereas biological treatment alternatives are scarce and include primarily anti-VEGF therapy and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors ( Mahmood et al., 2020 39. Mahmood, R.D. ∙ Morgan, R.D. ∙ Edmondson, R.J. ... First-line management of advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer Curr. Oncol. Rep. 2020; 22 :64 Google Scholar ). Specifically, the manipulation of the immune response through the administration of checkpoint inhibitors has not shown strong beneficial effects to date ( Doo et al., 2019 24. Doo, D.W. ∙ Norian, L.A. ∙ Arend, R.C. Checkpoint inhibitors in ovarian cancer: a review of preclinical data Gynecol. Oncol. Rep. 2019; 29 :48-54 Google Scholar ; Boland et al., 2019 10. Boland, J.L. ∙ Zhou, Q. ∙ Martin, M. ... Early disease progression and treatment discontinuation in patients with advanced ovarian cancer receiving immune checkpoint blockade Gynecol. Oncol. 2019; 152 :251-258 Google Scholar ), emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the immune response against this specific tumor.
In HGSOC patients, the tumor’s extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in promoting malignancy, as it supports cell growth and invasiveness ( Cho et al., 2015 15. Cho, A. ∙ Howell, V.M. ∙ Colvin, E.K. The extracellular matrix in epithelial ovarian cancer - A piece of a puzzle Front. Oncol. 2015; 5 :245 Google Scholar ). The malignant ECM is often highly fibrotic and constantly modulated by ECM-remodeling enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP14 (MT1-MMP), which is highly expressed on the HGSOC cell surface ( Kamel et al., 2010 35.

Here, using large-scale tumor section imaging, patient-derived monoclonal antibodies, and tumor target identification, we demonstrate that somatic hypermutations (SHMs) promote antibody reactivity to surface antigens in HGSOC patients in parallel to germline-encoded tumor-binding immunoglobulins.

Section: Results

IgG autoantibodies that primarily bind intracellular targets were described in HGSOC and other types of cancer ( Hu et al., 2019 31. Hu, X. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Wang, J. ... Landscape of B cell immunity and related immune evasion in human cancers Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :560-567 Google Scholar ; Sharonov et al., 2020 64. Sharonov, G.V. ∙ Serebrovskaya, E.O. ∙ Yuzhakova, D.V. ... B cells, plasma cells and antibody repertoires in the tumour microenvironment Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :294-307 Google Scholar ; Ran et al., 1976 57. Ran, M. ∙ Klein, G. ∙ Witz, I.P. Tumor-bound immunoglobulins. Evidence for the in vivo coating of tumor cells by potentially cytotoxic anti-tumour antibodies Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17 :90-97 Google Scholar ; Witz, 1977 79. Witz, I.P. Tumor-bound immunoglobulins: in situ expressions of humoral immunity Adv. Cancer Res. 1977; 25 :95-148 Google Scholar ), but whether endogenous antibodies can directly bind tumor surfaces in situ was never systematically examined in a large patient cohort. To this end, we examined 34 tumor samples collected from HGSOC patients who had not yet received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 17 healthy ovary and fallopian tube tissue samples. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens were stained with H&E and reviewed in a blinded manner by a certified pathologist specializing in gynecologic pathology to assure adequate sample quantity and quality ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ). Healthy samples from the female reproductive tract were histologically validated after being obtained from non-diseased contralateral adnexa of patients undergoing surgery as well as from 9 patients in the cohort whose final pathological diagnosis ruled out HGSOC. In order to visualize the maximal area in tumor sections and avoid topological biases, we systematically imaged large sections of tumors (1.1–5.12 cm 2 ) that were stained with anti-IgG fluorescent antibodies using a slide scanner ( Figure S1 A). In the majority of the patient samples, IgG-positive tumor cells were primarily located in proximity to the vascular stroma as well as the papillary areas of the tumor ( Figure 1 A). To precisely quantify the frequency of IgG-bound epithelial cells, we used a machine learning approach, QuPath ( Bankhead et al., 2017 7. Bankhead, P. ∙ Loughrey, M.B. ∙ Fernández, J.A. ... QuPath: open source software for digital pathology image analysis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :16878 Google Scholar ), to differentiate between stromal, epithelial, and immune cells based on multiple histological features, including nuclear shape, size, and chromatin density. This technique allowed us to quantify the number of IgG-coated cells per slide and determine their frequency in the sample. The malignant epithelial cells are thought to arise from either the fallopian tube epithelium ( Bowtell, 2010 12. Bowtell, D.D.L. The genesis and evolution of high-grade serous ovarian cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10 :803-808 Google Scholar ; Labidi-Galy et al., 2017 37. Labidi-Galy, S.I. ∙ Papp, E. ∙ Hallberg, D. ... High grade serous ovarian carcinomas originate in the fallopian tube Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1093 Google Scholar ; DeWeerdt, 2021 21. DeWeerdt, S. The origins of ovarian cancer Nature. 2021; 600 :S42-S44 Google Scholar ) or the ovarian surface epithelium ( Auersperg, 2013 5. Auersperg, N. Ovarian surface epithelium as a source of ovarian cancers: unwarranted speculation or evidence-based hypothesis? Gynecol. Oncol. 2013; 130 :246-251 Google Scholar ). Therefore, we used both fallopian tube and ovarian surface epithelial cells as healthy control tissues. ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). The percentages of IgG-coated cells out of the total epithelial cells in the sample for each patient or healthy control are shown in Figure 1 B. The majority (61%) of the analyzed HGSOC primary tumor specimens showed epithelial cell antibody coating above the background levels observed in healthy fallopian tube and ovarian surface epithelium ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Analysis of metastases recovered from the omentum of patients revealed IgG-positive cell clusters, suggesting that antibodies target tumor cells during the process of cancer dissemination as well ( Figure S1 B). Overall, this large-scale analysis demonstrates that malignant epithelial cells are targeted by endogenous IgG antibodies in HGSOC patients.
We next examined whether IgG targeting of tumor cell surfaces occurs in other types of cancer. For this purpose, we examined 345 tumor specimens originating from 24 different human cancers derived from different organs. Quantification of IgG-coated cells using our computational analysis revealed that renal and urothelial carcinoma showed high levels of antibody coating, whereas fibrosarcoma showed nearly no fluorescence signal. B cell lymphomas were used as positive controls since they commonly express class-switched antibodies on their surface ( Figure 1 C). We conclude that the targeting of solid tumors by IgG indicates a general phenomenon, which frequently occurs in multiple cancers. Thus, in analogy to the classification of tumors as “hot” and “cold” based on immune cell infiltrates, tumors can be classified as “antibody reactive” or “antibody non-reactive.”
To examine if the observed antibodies physically interact with the tumor cell surface in fresh samples, the extent of IgG coating was measured by flow cytometric analysis of live tumor cells. For this purpose, fresh samples, including primary tumors, omental metastases, and cells from ascites fluids were retrieved from surgical specimens removed from 10 stage III–IV chemo-naive HGSOC patients, which was followed by the removal of lymphocytes and fibroblasts. The cells were incubated with fluorescent anti-IgG antibodies, and the frequency of IgG-positive tumor cells was quantified. About ∼50% of the epithelial cells, including metastatic cells, were coated by IgGs on their surface, whereas the cultured control HGSOC cell line, OVCAR3, was IgG negative ( Figure 1 D). To further assess the tumor reactivity of the patient-derived antibodies, we purified IgGs from ascites fluids and compared their tumor binding capacity to that of IgGs purified from patient sera and age-matched healthy subjects by immunofluorescence analysis ( Table S2 ). In this assay, 72% (18/25) of the ascites IgG samples showed tumor reactivity above the average tumor reactivity of the controls ( Figure 1 E). These results, together with the immunohistochemistry analysis, demonstrate that the surface of tumor cells is targeted by endogenous IgGs in HGSOC patients.
Next, we examined whether the tumor-reactive IgGs are produced by intratumoral ASCs. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor samples revealed that CD20 + B cells form TLS-like clusters enveloped by CD138 + plasma cells (PCs) scattered in the stromal tissue adjacent to the tumor cells. An average of 50% of these cells were IgG-positive ASCs ( Figure 1 F). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that 40%–96.6% of intratumoral ASCs expressed IgG1 in different patients while the frequency of IgG1 + B cells was significantly lower ( Figure 1 G). This result demonstrates that the total B cell compartment does not represent the antibody-producing cell population. Finally, we examined whether the presence of IgG + ASCs or tumor-binding antibodies correlates with positive patient outcomes. This analysis revealed that the presence of IgG-positive ASCs as well as IgG-tumor coating within the cancer tissues are associated with superior progression-free and overall survival in HGSOC patients ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Collectively, our observations indicate that IgG1 is a major isotype of antibodies expressed by intratumoral ASCs with the capacity to target tumor cell surfaces.
Antigen-driven positive selection and clonal expansion of B cells take place in GCs in response to immune challenge. We next examined whether the intratumoral ASCs in HGSOC are clonally related and emerge from the antibody affinity maturation process. For this purpose, we obtained fresh tumor samples from four stage III–IV HGSOC patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( Table S3 ). Single IgG1 + ASCs with unknown specificity were sorted from processed tumors, and their heavy ( Ighg1 ) and light chain mRNAs ( Igk and Igλ ) were sequenced by single-cell immunoglobulin sequencing ( Tiller et al., 2008 66. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expressionvector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 A). Immunoglobulin gene analysis showed that Vh3 was the most frequent variable region in intratumoral ASCs, whereas the frequency of other specific light chain genes was more varied ( Figure 2 A). Furthermore, recurrent pairings of specific heavy and light chains were observed in individual patients but not shared among the four patients, indicating that common public clones did not emerge in this group of patients ( Figure S2 B). Immunoglobulin clustering based on either heavy chain or light chain sequences revealed that in each of the four patients, at least 44.4% of the sequences were recovered more than once, suggesting that ASCs in tumors were clonally expanded. Heavy chain analysis revealed 11–36 expanded clonotypes per patient, comprising 44.4%–78.38% of the ASCs obtained from each of the four patients, including a single dominant clone, with a frequency ranging between 5.85% and 18% of the total sequences ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Similar results were obtained following a more precise analysis using coupled heavy and light chain sequences for the definition of a clone ( Figure 2 C). The ASC immunoglobulin genes displayed a level of SHMs that is typical of circulating memory cells, with averages ranging between 17.29 and 21.69 mutations per heavy chain and between 10.3 and 16.46 mutations per light chain ( Figure 2 D). These paired measurements correlated closely on a single-cell basis for all of the patients and accordingly validate our immunoglobulin sequence analyses ( Figure S2 C). To examine whether the intratumoral ASC clonal members were produced through clonal diversification, we reconstructed lineage trees of clones recovered from tumors using PHYLIP and Alakazam ( Felsenstein, 2005 26. Felsenstein, J. PHYLIP (phylogeny Inference Package) 2005 Distributed by the Author (Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington). http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html Google Scholar ; Gupta et al., 2015 29. Gupta, N.T. ∙ Vander Heiden, J.A. ∙ Uduman, M. ... Change-O: A toolkit for analyzing large-scale B cell immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3356-3358 Google Scholar ). We found several families of clones that exhibited clonal diversification by progressive SHM accumulation, indicating that these cells are the product of stepwise positive selection ( Figures 2 E and S3 ). We conclude that significant numbers of ASCs in the tumor microenvironment were diversified by SHMs from a common ancestor, suggesting that their clonal expansion was driven by specific antigens as part of a T cell-dependent immune response.
To further study the nature of the humoral immune response in HGSOC patients, we cloned the immunoglobulins that we isolated and expressed them as monoclonal antibodies ( Table S4 ). To this end, immunoglobulins representing expanded clones were primarily selected for antibody production and within each clonal family, either immunoglobulin sequences that represent multiple clonal members or clones with the highest SHM load were chosen ( Figure S3 ). In order to examine whether the monoclonal antibodies bind the patient-derived tumor cells, we established HGSOC primary cultures originating from the primary tumor, omental metastasis, and ascites-derived tumor cells of three different patients. To remove cell-bound antibodies, as well as fibroblasts and immune cells, the tumor cells were isolated, cultured, and maintained for 2–3 passages. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all of the cultured cells were EpCAM positive ( Figure S4 A). Monoclonal and secondary antibodies were incubated with monolayers of primary tumor cultures or with the OVCAR3 cell line followed by measurement of the fluorescence signal. To avoid biases that can potentially arise from the different numbers of cells per sample, we also stained the monolayers with DAPI, which allowed us to normalize the fluorescence signal to the number of cells in each replicate. This analysis revealed that all the patients produced tumor-binding antibodies. Out of 27 monoclonal antibodies, 15 bound the primary and ascites-derived tumor cultures, and 17 of the monoclonal antibodies interacted with the cells that were generated from the omental metastasis tumor cells ( Figure 3 A). To provide direct evidence for tumor cell binding by monoclonal antibodies, we stained OVCAR3 monolayers and measured antibody binding on the single-cell level by fluorescence microscopy and QuPath analysis ( Figure S1 ). This approach revealed that most of the antibodies bound directly to the tumor cell lines ( Figure 3 B). Furthermore, the monoclonal antibodies primarily interacted with ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OVCAR3 and 4) and a pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC1) and interacted to a lesser extent with the cells derived from other organs, suggesting specificity to both ovarian and pancreatic tumors, presumably through shared surface target antigens ( Figure S4 B). Thus, the ASCs located within the tumor microenvironment produce tumor-targeting antibodies.
Ovarian and pancreatic cancers are highly desmoplastic (fibrotic) and are constantly subjected to remodeling of their microenvironments by matrix proteases ( Kamel et al., 2010 35.

The ECM-remodeling enzymes, MMPs, were previously demonstrated to trigger the generation of autoreactive antibodies in autoimmune diseases and viral infection, suggesting that they may also provoke an immune response in cancer ( Crowley et al., 2016 17.

Oncol. 2000; 17 :673-681 Google Scholar ). Therefore, we evaluated the binding capacity of polyclonal IgGs derived from the ascites fluids from 25 patients ( Table S2 ) to 6 recombinant MMPs and 3 additional ECM-associated targets. In this setting, BSA was used as a negative control antigen, and p53, which elicits an antibody response in HGSOC ( Anderson et al., 2015 1. Anderson, K.S. ∙ Cramer, D.W. ∙ Sibani, S. ... Autoantibody signature for the serologic detection of ovarian cancer J. Proteome Res. 2015; 14 :578-586 Google Scholar ), was used as a positive control target. ELISA revealed strong and reproducible antibody reactivity against MMP14 in all of the patients. Although reactivity to other MMPs was also evident, it was to a lesser extent ( Figure 3 C). Accordingly, analysis of HGSOC RNA-seq datasets showed a high expression of MMP14 compared with other expressed genes, as well as in comparison with healthy control tissues ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Immunohistochemistry analyses revealed a strong expression of MMP14 on cancer cells, whereas adjacent healthy tissues showed lower expression levels ( Figure S5 C). Furthermore, using western blot analysis, MMP14 protein expression was also detected in tumor cell lines as well as in the patient-derived tumors ( Figure S5 D). Thus, since MMP14 is highly expressed on tumors and ascites-derived antibodies show high reactivity with this enzyme, we reasoned that this is a highly relevant target in HGSOC patients for further testing of patient-derived monoclonal antibodies.
Evaluation of monoclonal antibody binding to MMPs by ELISA revealed several immunoglobulins that reproducibly bound to MMP14, with a mild to moderate cross-reactivity with other MMP enzymes ( Figure 3 D). Strikingly, in all 4 of the patients, monoclonal antibodies that bound MMP14 with various degrees of efficacy and specificity were detected, confirming our analyses using polyclonal patient-derived antibodies. To strengthen our findings, we tested the binding of monoclonal antibodies to MMP14 at different dilutions by ELISA and found a dose-dependent response ( Figure 3 E). To examine if these antibodies are reactive with many types of antigens (polyreactive), we tested their binding to a panel of structurally unrelated, biologically relevant antigens, including insulin, double-stranded DNA, and lipopolysaccharide, by ELISA. Typically, antibodies that bind at least two members of this defined set of antigens are considered polyreactive ( Wardemann et al., 2003 75. Wardemann, H. ∙ Yurasov, S. ∙ Schaefer, A. ... Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors Science. 2003; 301 :1374-1377 Google Scholar ). ED38, a well-characterized polyreactive antibody, was used as a positive control, and GD01, an antibody that binds an unrelated target (Junin virus GP1), was used as a negative control. Minimal binding of the monoclonal antibodies to the unrelated targets was detected even at high antibody concentrations, whereas the polyreactive ED38 was strongly positive in this assay ( Figure 3 F). Similar results were obtained from testing the binding to human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cell lysates, a commonly used assay to determine antibody polyreactivity ( Figure 3 F). We conclude that the monoclonal antibodies that we isolated are not polyreactive and show strong binding to MMPs, particularly to MMP14, which is abundantly expressed on the surface of HGSOC tumor cells.
Our findings indicate that self-reactive antibodies are formed in cancer patients with the potential to bind healthy tissues in addition to tumor cells. To examine this possibility, we purified IgGs from serum and ascites of individual patients and examined their binding capacity to several normal tissues, including fallopian tube, uterus, pancreas, and colon tissues, all of which are known to express MMP14. Staining with LEM 2/15, highly specific and well-characterized mouse antibody that binds MMP14 ( Udi et al., 2013 68. Udi, Y. ∙ Fragai, M. ∙ Grossman, M. ... Unraveling hidden allosteric regulatory sites in structurally homologues metalloproteases J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 :2330-2346 Google Scholar ), confirmed MMP14 expression on various cell types within the healthy tissues ( Figure S6 A). This analysis revealed that antibodies derived from patient serum can bind healthy tissues, although significantly less effectively than ascites-derived antibodies. To evaluate whether self-reactive antibodies persist during cancer remission, we collected blood from eight patients who completed their adjuvant treatment. All the evaluated patients exhibited CA125 values within the normal range, and no evidence of disease was observed by PET-CT ( Table S5 ). ELISA revealed a weak signal in this cohort, which was above the background that was detected in healthy controls, and only one out of the eight patients had high levels of anti-MMP14 antibodies in her serum ( Figures S6 B and S6C).
Finally, a large-scale retrospective analysis of 870,356 women (including 3,353 ovarian cancer patients) over a follow-up period of up to 15 years was performed based on the electronic health record (EHR) database from Clalit Healthcare Services ( Balicer and Afek, 2017 6. Balicer, R.D. ∙ Afek, A. Digital health nation: Israel’s global big data innovation hub Lancet. 2017; 389 :2451-2453 Google Scholar ). This analysis did not reveal an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases among the patients previously diagnosed with ovarian cancer ( Figure S6 D). Collectively, although we did find autoantibodies in sera of HGSOC patients, no signs of autoimmune diseases were detected in the patients. Of note, the recovered patients were subjected to various treatments, including chemotherapy, which may affect their ability to produce antibodies.
To provide additional evidence for MMP14 binding by patient-derived antibodies, we further characterized one such clone, T13, an antibody that showed effective binding to MMP14 by ELISA in multiple antigen binding assays. Using the Octet QKe platform, we found that the K D value of T13 was 410 ± 45 nM (R 2 = 99.34%) ( Figure 4 A). To examine whether T13 binds a linear epitope or a complex protein conformation, we performed a western blot analysis on 14 different cell lines of epithelial, mesenchymal, and neural crest origin, representing a wide variety of cell types and organs. Bands of approximately 63 kDa were detected in this assay, compatible with the size of MMP14, and an additional ∼35 kDa band appeared as well, which coincides with a known degradation product of MMP14 ( Figure 4 B). Notably, OVCAR3 and HT1080, which express high levels of MMP14, showed the strongest signals, and very few additional bands were detected. To verify that the antibody binds native MMP14, we expressed MMP14 together with mCherry in K562 cells. Although the antibody did not show binding to mCherry-negative cells, mCherry-positive cells showed clear antibody binding by flow cytometric analysis ( Figures 4 C and S4 C). To further examine cross-reactivity and identify additional potential surface targets, we tested the binding of T13 as well as an antibody that did not bind OVCAR3 as a control (T15) to a microarray that included 9,400 recombinant human proteins (either full length or fragments). Although several membrane proteins showed reactivity with T13, the manual inspection of their sequences and validation by traditional ELISA did not reveal additional surface molecules that could serve as a target for the monoclonal antibodies on tumor cells ( Figures S7 A and S7B; Table S6 ). Other antibodies that were tested in this assay did not reveal cell surface or tumor-associated targets that are relevant to HGSOC. Overall, these results demonstrate that a linear epitope on MMP14 is a major target for the T13 monoclonal antibody.
To identify the binding site of T13 on MMP14, we used a phage display assay to analyze binding to random peptides ( Ashkenazy et al., 2021 4. Ashkenazy, H. ∙ Avram, O. ∙ Ryvkin, A. ... Motifier: an IgOme profiler based on peptide motifs using machine learning J. Mol. Biol. 2021; 433 :167071 Google Scholar ; Freund et al., 2009 27. Freund ∙ Tarnovitski, N. ∙ Enshell-Seijffers, D. ... Phage display selection, analysis, and prediction of B cell epitopes Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2009; 9 :8 Google Scholar ). Although an antibody that did not show tumor reactivity (T15) interacted with only 10,222 peptides, T13 interacted with 529,495 peptides, and 85.1% of these showed a strong homology to a sequence found in the MMP14 catalytic site ( Figure 4 D). ELISA confirmed the binding of T13 and of T12, an additional clonal member with similar specificity, to the homologous sequence found on MMP14 but not to a control peptide derived from a non-binding region ( Figure 4 E). Further to this analysis, the molecular structure of the T13 antibody was modeled using the AlphaFold framework ( Mirdita et al., 2021 44. Mirdita, Milot ∙ Schütze, K. ∙ Moriwaki, Y. ... ColabFold - making protein folding accessible to all Biorxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ; Jumper et al., 2021 33. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Google Scholar ) followed by the Global Docking computation of the MMP14-T13 atomic model complex. The PatchDock algorithm was used to dock the MMP14 (PDB 5H0U ) atomic model to the predicted T13 model using the protein-protein refinement stage on the FireDock server ( Duhovny et al., 2002 25. Duhovny, D. ∙ Nussinov, R. ∙ Wolfson, H. Efficient unbound docking of rigid molecules Guigó, R. ∙ Gusfield, D. (Editors) Proceedings of the 2’nd Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI) Rome, Italy, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2452 2002 Google Scholar ; Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005 62.

Mashiach, E. ∙ Schneidman-Duhovny, D. ∙ Andrusier, N. ... FireDock: A web server for fast interaction refinement in molecular docking Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :W229-W232 Google Scholar ). This analysis resulted in a “top hit” comprising the peptide sequence found in our phage display assay and identified by ELISA ( Figure 4 F). Collectively, these data predict the binding epitope of one of the patient-derived antibodies on MMP14.
B cell central tolerance is established during the development of mature B cells in the bone marrow (BM) where autoreactive clones are eliminated. Nonetheless, it has been estimated that 5% of the B cells that emerge from this process are autoreactive but typically do not cause an apparent autoimmune disease ( Wardemann et al., 2003 75. Wardemann, H. ∙ Yurasov, S. ∙ Schaefer, A. ... Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors Science. 2003; 301 :1374-1377 Google Scholar ). An additional pathway for the generation of autoreactive antibodies is through the insertion of SHMs into the immunoglobulin genes of antibodies that do not bind a self-target in their original germline version ( Piccoli et al., 2015 53.

Autoreactivity in human IgG+ memory B cells Immunity. 2007; 26 :205-213 Google Scholar ). To examine whether the binding of patient-derived monoclonal antibodies depended on SHMs for tumor binding, we generated parental immunoglobulin configurations by reverting their sequence to their germline versions and tested their binding capacity to OVCAR3 using fluorescence microscopy and QuPath analysis. For this purpose, we used antibodies that showed a significant or moderate tumor binding by the immunofluorescence assay ( Figure 3 A). This assay revealed eleven patient-derived monoclonal antibodies that lost tumor binding after removal of SHMs and an additional twelve antibodies that did not show a significant decrease in tumor binding in their germline form ( Figure 5 A). Interestingly, two antibodies gained binding to the tumor cell line after removal of the SHMs ( Figure 5 A). We conclude that two types of tumor-reactive antibodies exist in the patients: one that depends on SHMs for tumor binding (class I) and another type that binds the tumor in their germline form (class II).
To strengthen our antibody classification, we tested the binding of germline antibodies to MMP14 using ELISA. Similar to the previous experiment, this analysis revealed two groups of antibodies: one that depends on SHMs for MMP14 binding and one whose members bind MMP14 in their germline configurations ( Figure 5 B). These data suggest that antitumor antibodies can form before the introduction of an antigen in a germline version and also develop through the acquisition of SHMs.
To gain more insights regarding the role of SHMs in affinity maturation, in addition to the germline configuration, we generated inferred ancestors based on shared and non-shared SHMs among sequences within clonal families. For this purpose, sequences that contain only shared mutations in their downstream diversified progenies were used for the generation of monoclonal antibodies. ELISA demonstrated that T13 shows effective binding to MMP14, whereas its inferred ancestor exhibited decreased binding when the non-shared mutations were removed in a stepwise manner ( Figure 5 C). Similar results were obtained from the analysis of the inferred ancestors of T17 ( Figure 5 C). These two examples indicate that a stepwise increase in the affinity against MMP14 may occur in HGSOC patients.
To examine whether the two antibody classes exhibit potential antitumor effector activity, we examined their Fc-mediated functions. Antibodies can support antibody-dependent cellular phagocytic (ADCP) activity through interaction with Fc receptors expressed on phagocytic cells ( Wieland and Ahmed, 2019 77. Wieland, A. ∙ Ahmed, R. Fc receptors in antimicrobial protection Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2019; 423 :119-150 Google Scholar ; DiLillo and Ravetch, 2015 23. DiLillo, D.J. ∙ Ravetch, J.V. Fc-receptor interactions regulate both cytotoxic and immunomodulatory therapeutic antibody effector functions Cancer Immunol. Res. 2015; 3 :704-713 Google Scholar ; Webb et al., 2021 76. Webb, N.E. ∙ Bernshtein, B. ∙ Alter, G. Tissues: the unexplored frontier of antibody mediated immunity Curr. Opin. Virol. 2021; 47 :52-67 Google Scholar ). Incubation of THP-1 monocytes with 25 patient-derived polyclonal antibodies ( Table S2 ) and MMP14-coated beads induced their effective uptake by the cells ( Figure 6 A). Furthermore, incubation of patient-derived polyclonal antibodies with OVCAR3 cells induced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) by NK cells ( Figure 6 B). Of note, these antibodies carry post-translational modifications which were introduced naturally within the patients. By contrast, only some of the monoclonal antibodies were effective in inducing effective ADCP and ADCC ( Figures 6 C and 6D), suggesting that different affinities and targeted epitopes affect the functions of specific antibodies. These results demonstrate that all ovarian cancer patients have antibodies with effector function potential, but not all of the antibodies can trigger antitumor activity by effector cells. Nonetheless, although clusters of T cells were detected in the stromal compartment of most of the HGSOC tumors, NK cells were very rare ( Figure S7 C). Collectively, these findings indicate that tumor-reactive antibodies in HGSOC have functional potential. Yet, ineffective recruitment of effector cells, such as NK cells, into the tumors or dysfunction of other cell types ( DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019 20. DeNardo, D.G. ∙ Ruffell, B. Macrophages as regulators of tumour immunity and immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :369-382 Google Scholar ) may preclude effective activation of cell-mediated antibody-effector functions.

Section: Discussion

The presence of B cells in tumors was associated with a positive prognosis in some cancers, yet it remains unknown how tumor-binding antibodies evolve. Using large-scale imaging approaches, we demonstrate that the surfaces of HGSOC and many other tumors are frequently coated with endogenous IgG antibodies. Through bait-free single-cell sequencing and antibody cloning, we found that SHMs support endogenous antibody-mediated immune response in HGSOC patients in parallel to pre-existing antibody autoreactivity. Conceptually, our results describe the evolution of the serological immune response in cancer patients and show that the antibodies that bind the tumor cells can emerge from non-reactive precursors through antigen-driven positive selection (class I). In parallel, pre-existing autoreactive B cells that escape deletion during negative selection in the BM are also recruited to the tumor and contribute to the overall humoral immune response (class II). As opposed to autoantibodies in deleterious autoimmune diseases, both antibody classes have the potential for beneficial functions in cancer patients; however, additional players are required for effective tumor eradication, such as the infiltration of effector cells.
It was shown that a humoral immune response against foreign viral proteins can form in HPV-driven head and neck cancer ( Wieland et al., 2021 78. Wieland, A. ∙ Patel, M.R. ∙ Cardenas, M.A. ... Defining HPV-specific B cell responses in patients with head and neck cancer Nature. 2021; 597 :274-278 Google Scholar ). We demonstrate that autoantibodies against self-antigens are formed in HGSOC patients, but in contrast to the immune response elicited against foreign antigens, this process must involve a break in immune tolerance. It is most likely that the unusually high levels of antigens, such as MMP14, activate rare autoreactive B cells with the capacity to generate autoantibodies ( Kaimal et al., 2013 34. Kaimal, R. ∙ Aljumaily, R. ∙ Tressel, S.L. ... Selective blockade of matrix Metalloprotease-14 with a monoclonal antibody abrogates invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth in ovarian cancer Cancer Res. 2013; 73 :2457-2467 Google Scholar ; Zaenker et al., 2016 83. Zaenker, P. ∙ Gray, E.S. ∙ Ziman, M.R. Autoantibody production in cancer—the humoral immune response toward autologous antigens in cancer patients Autoimmun. Rev. 2016; 15 :477-483 Google Scholar ). This hypothesis is difficult to test in human patients because the antibodies represent the end product of the immune response when the break in tolerance already occurred. We suggest that the chronic nature of the cancer and high antigenic load have the potential to drive the accumulation of SHMs over time and generate endogenous antibodies with a tumor binding capacity.
MMP14 is highly expressed in HGSOC, and the activity of this enzyme is essential for tumor progression and metastatic dissemination ( Kaimal et al., 2013 34. Kaimal, R. ∙ Aljumaily, R. ∙ Tressel, S.L. ... Selective blockade of matrix Metalloprotease-14 with a monoclonal antibody abrogates invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth in ovarian cancer Cancer Res. 2013; 73 :2457-2467 Google Scholar ; Vos et al., 2021 72. Vos, M.C. ∙ van der Wurff, A.A.M. ∙ van Kuppevelt, T.H. ... The role of MMP-14 in ovarian cancer: a systematic review J. Ovarian Res. 2021; 14 :1-13 Google Scholar ; Moss et al., 2009 47. Moss, N.M. ∙ Barbolina, M.V. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Ovarian cancer cell detachment and multicellular aggregate formation are regulated by membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase: a potential role in I.p. metastatic dissemination Cancer Res. 2009; 69 :7121-7129 Google Scholar ). We recovered several tumor-binding antibodies, of which 9 showed reactivity with MMP14 as well as milder cross-reactivity with other similar enzymes but not with other protein and non-protein targets that were tested. Since MMP14 is a surface-bound enzyme and expressed in unusually high levels on the tumor surface, we suggest that this is the most relevant self-target of our cloned antibodies in HGSOC. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that other antigens are targeted by MMP14-reactive antibodies as well.
The presence of SHMs and gradual increase in antibody affinity from the germline configuration to the final mutated form indicate that an antigen-driven process took place in the patients. Acquisition of SHMs typically takes place in GCs that can be located either in the tumor within TLS or in tumor-draining lymph nodes ( Kroeger et al., 2016 36. Kroeger, D.R. ∙ Milne, K. ∙ Nelson, B.H. Tumor-infiltrating plasma cells are associated with tertiary lymphoid structures, cytolytic T-cell responses, and superior prognosis in ovarian cancer Clin. Cancer Res. 2016; 22 :3005-3015 Google Scholar ). Of note, the size of excised ovarian tumors is large, typically ranging from 5 cm to more than 30 cm in their largest dimension. In order to extract and sequence antibody-secreting cells, we used a very small fragment of the tumor (less than 1 cubic cm). If cells clonally expand at a distant site and then home to the tumor through the circulation, the chances of detection of clonally related ASCs without a bait is extremely small, as they would be expected to spread throughout the tumor tissue and other organs such as the BM and mix with other non-related clones. Yet, the possibility that the mutated cells originated from draining lymph nodes cannot be excluded, and further studies are needed to address this question.
Affinity-based selection is a highly regulated process that involves well-defined cellular and molecular interactions ( Biram et al., 2019 8. Biram, A. ∙ Davidzohn, N. ∙ Shulman, Z. T cell interactions with B cells during germinal center formation, a three-step model Immunol. Rev. 2019; 288 :37-48 Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, it remains possible that the response started as a “bystander” reaction and drifted toward MMP14 specificity as a result of the abundant antigen or a different break-of-tolerance driver. Indeed, few autoreactive cells have the potential to generate new self-reactive antibodies through epitope spreading and thereby enhance the overall autoreactivity against the tumor ( Degn et al., 2017 19. Degn, S.E. ∙ van der Poel, C.E. ∙ Firl, D.J. ... Clonal evolution of autoreactive germinal centers Cell. 2017; 170 :913-926.e19 Google Scholar ; Vinuesa et al., 2009 71. Vinuesa, C.G. ∙ Sanz, I. ∙ Cook, M.C. Dysregulation of germinal centres in autoimmune disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9 :845-857 Google Scholar ; Cornaby et al., 2015 16. Cornaby, C. ∙ Gibbons, L. ∙ Mayhew, V. ... B cell epitope spreading: mechanisms and contribution to autoimmune diseases Immunol. Lett. 2015; 163 :56-68 Google Scholar ). An additional possible source of class I antibodies are mutated memory cells that evolved in response to foreign stimuli and acquire cross-reactivity with tumor antigens, as demonstrated in some infectious diseases ( Yang et al., 2021 81. Yang, F. ∙ Nielsen, S.C.A. ∙ Hoh, R.A. ... Shared B cell memory to coronaviruses and other pathogens varies in human age groups and tissues Science. 2021; 372 :738-741 Google Scholar ). As opposed to class I, class II antibodies are tumor reactive, and yet, SHMs did not contribute to their tumor binding capacity, which might suggest that they were elicited against a different antigen, while retaining their original reactivity toward MMP14. Thus, it is most likely that class II antibodies emerged in a bystander response, which was further amplified in response to the tumor cells. Furthermore, since the B cell response is ongoing within the patients, class II antibodies can potentially convert to class I upon the acquisition of additional SHMs.
Our work demonstrates that, in contrast to cell-mediated immune responses, the humoral response against the tumor in HGSOC is largely intact and has the potential to trigger Fc-mediated antitumor effector functions ( Webb et al., 2021 76. Webb, N.E. ∙ Bernshtein, B. ∙ Alter, G. Tissues: the unexplored frontier of antibody mediated immunity Curr. Opin. Virol. 2021; 47 :52-67 Google Scholar ). Yet, it was shown that antibodies can interact with Fcγ receptors on tumor-associated macrophages, promoting angiogenesis and tumor progression ( Andreu et al., 2010 2. Andreu, P. ∙ Johansson, M. ∙ Affara, N.I. ... FcRgamma activation regulates inflammation-associated squamous carcinogenesis Cancer Cell. 2010; 17 :121-134 Google Scholar ; DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019 20. DeNardo, D.G. ∙ Ruffell, B. Macrophages as regulators of tumour immunity and immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :369-382 Google Scholar ). Furthermore, in this context, it was demonstrated that the inhibition of Fcγ receptor signaling can reverse the T cell dysfunctional state in tumors, suggesting that macrophage engagement with antibodies could have an immunosuppressive effect on the antitumor immune response ( DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019 20. DeNardo, D.G. ∙ Ruffell, B. Macrophages as regulators of tumour immunity and immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :369-382 Google Scholar ). It is most likely that dysfunctional phagocytic cells and insufficient recruitment of effector cells such as NK cells preclude adequate antibody-mediated effector functions such as ADCP and ADCC ( Uppendahl et al., 2017 69. Uppendahl, L.D. ∙ Dahl, C.M. ∙ Miller, J.S. ... Natural killer cell-based immunotherapy in gynecologic malignancy: a review Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1825 Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, the presence of IgGs and other isotypes in the tumor correlated with disease-free progression and patient survival, suggesting that antibodies in patients have overall beneficial functions ( Biswas et al., 2021 9. Biswas, S. ∙ Mandal, G. ∙ Payne, K.K. ... IgA transcytosis and antigen recognition govern ovarian cancer immunity Nature. 2021; 591 :464-470 Google Scholar ; Hu et al., 2019 31. Hu, X. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Wang, J. ... Landscape of B cell immunity and related immune evasion in human cancers Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :560-567 Google Scholar ).
Collectively, our study describes a target for antibodies in HGSOC and demonstrates that the responding antibodies are divided into two classes based on their origin. Patient-derived monoclonal antibodies are potentially useful for chemoattractants or drug delivery to tumors and for cell-mediated therapeutic approaches, such as in CAR-T cell therapy.
Since we examined samples from human patients rather than a mouse lab model, we were unable to explore the mechanism through which the break of tolerance occurred in the patients, and further studies should address this point. Furthermore, although we found that several of the monoclonal antibodies bind MMP14, we cannot exclude additional targets. Lastly, since we examined antibody-forming cells isolated from the tumors, we were unable to determine whether they originated from the tumor mass or migrated from tumor-draining lymph nodes.

The acquisition of human samples for the purpose of this study was approved by the Helsinki committee of the Rabin Medical Center under protocol 0450-16-RMC and by the Institutional Review Board of the Weizmann Institute of Science under protocol 71-1. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their recruitment to the study. Throughout the study, data were collected based on human samples obtained from four patient cohorts as detailed below. The clinical characteristics of each of these cohorts appear in Tables S1–S3 and S5 .
A total of 37 FFPE samples were collected from the surgical theatre and department of pathology at the Rabin medical center (29/37) and purchased from the Sheba medical center biobank (8/37). All FFPE specimens in this study were reviewed by a certified gyneco-pathologist to confirm the diagnosis of HGSOC and to ensure sufficient tumor quantity and quality. Moreover, all samples originate from chemonaive patients who underwent primary surgery (TAH/BSO) at the time of sample acquisition. 3 samples were removed from the cohort due to poor specimen quality - culminating in 34 FFPE samples; 81.1% of patients in this cohort had stage III-IV disease.
A total of 25 ascites samples were obtained from the surgical theatre and department of gynecologic oncology at the Rabin medical center (7/25) and purchased from the Sheba medical center biobank (18/25). When obtained fresh, fluids were separated to their liquid and cellular phases and cryopreserved accordingly. All cellular samples were preserved in 90% fetal calf serum plus 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen vapor phase conditions. Fluid samples were flash frozen and stored at -80C. 100% of these patients in this cohort had stage III-IV disease.
Fresh tissue samples were obtained from the surgical theatre at the Rabin medical center during the patients’ primary surgery (TAH/BSO). Specimens collected included samples of ovarian carcinoma primary tumors, metastases, ascites fluids (enlisted in cohort 2) and peripheral blood as well as samples of healthy ovaries and fallopian tubes from the contralateral non-diseased adnexa, when available. Acquired tissues and tumors were frozen as single cell suspensions and protein extracts, and were also preserved in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks (enlisted in cohort 1). Protein extracts were flash frozen and stored at -80C. Samples from a total of 19 chemonaive patients were obtained. Of these, 10 patients received a pathological diagnosis of HGSOC and thus were included in this study. The remaining 9 patients were excluded from this cohort based on the following pathological diagnoses: fibrothecoma (2/9), borderline ovarian carcinoma (2/9), granulosa cell tumor (1/9), high grade ovarian leiomyosarcoma (1/9), Low grade endometrial carcinoma with ovarian involvement (1/9), Mucinous ovarian carcinoma (1/9), Primary peritoneal carcinoma (1/9). 100% of patients in this cohort had stage III-IV disease.
A total of 8 blood samples of HGSOC patients in remission were obtained from the department of gynecological oncology at the Rabin medical center. All patients underwent TAH/BSO, completed their adjuvant therapy and exhibited CA125 values within normal range as well as no evidence of disease on PET/CT. Samples were collected during routine follow up visits with a mean remission duration of 7.3 months (range: 2.3-17.9 months). At the time of diagnosis, 75% of these patients had stage III-IV disease.
FFPE samples of multiple human tumor types were procured as a tissue microarray (MC5004) from US Biomax.
Information about study participants can be found in Table S7 .
Cell lines and primary cultures were maintained in DMEM media supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) MEM-Eagle non essential amino acids, 1% (v/v) 2mM glutamine and 1% (v/v) Pen-Strep solution. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide.
ADR/Res, IGROV1, SKOV3, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR5, OVCAR8, PANC1, MCF7, HT29, MDAMB435, HEK293T, HEp-2 and K562 were obtained from the Weizmann Institute of Science cell repository. Cell lines originating from the Weizmann Institute of Science cell repository are pre-authenticated and confirmed to be mycoplasma free.
Fresh HGSOC primary tumor, omental metastases, and ascites samples were retrieved from the operating theatre. Primary cultures were established from these specimens as previously described ( O Donnell et al., 2014 51. O Donnell, R.L. ∙ McCormick, A. ∙ Mukhopadhyay, A. ... The use of ovarian cancer cells from patients undergoing surgery to generate primary cultures capable of undergoing functional analysis PLoS One. 2014; 9 :e90604 Google Scholar ) and used after 2-3 passages. Cell preparation included removing fibroblasts as well as all non-adherent cells from the culture. 100% of the cultured cells were EpCAM positive (324207, Biolegend, 1:200). For quantification of tumor IgG binding by flow cytometry, primary cultures were stained for IgG (709-545-149, Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:200) 24 hours following sample acquisition, and evaluated using a flow cytometer.
The following commercial antibodies were used: IgG (709-545-149, Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:200), CD138 (10593-1-AP, Proteintech, 1:800), CD20 (M0755, Dako, 1:200), CD3 (SP7, Thermo, 1:25), CD56 (AF2408-SP, R&D, 10μg/ml) and MMP14 (LEM-2/15.8, 1:100). Briefly, FFPE specimens were sectioned onto 4μm slides, stained with H&E and evaluated by a certified gynco-pathologist, to assure adequate sample quantity and quality. Unstained slides were then deparaffinized, subjected to antigen retrieval in TE buffer, blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin for 90 minutes, and stained with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, overnight at 4°C and for 2 hrs at room temperature, respectively. Slides were then stained with DAPI (1:5000) and sealed using Immunomount.
Stained slides were scanned using a 3D Histech Pannoramic SCAN II slide scanner. Post processing of the scanned raw data included identification of all nuclei in the sample using QuPath v0.2.0-m9 cell detection function. Threshold parameters were optimized to identify nuclei of all shapes and sizes, and IgG signal was quantified within a 2μm radius of the nuclear border. An object classifier based on the Random trees (RTrees) machine learning algorithm was trained to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cell architectures. To negate potential bias, the training was performed on the basis of a multitude of parameters derived from the nuclear data layer (DAPI) only. The software could then distinguish between IgG positive and negative cells and calculate the percentage of IgG-positive cells within each compartment. Quantification of various populations of immune cells was performed in a similar manner using samples stained for CD138, CD20, IgG, DAPI or CD56 and CD3.
Polyclonal IgG fractions were isolated from ascites fluids and sera. Briefly, the fluids of interest were filtered through a 0.2μm filter and reacted with protein G Sepharose beads (17-0618-05, Cytiva/GE) on a tilt table, overnight in 4°C. Beads were then pulled down, washed in PBS and eluted using IgG elution buffer (21004, ThermoFisher) into 1M TRIS pH 9. The eluate was then dialyzed against PBS overnight.
Cell lines or primary cultures of interest were grown on 96 well plates or chamber slides, fixed with 4% PFA, washed with PBS, blocked with 1% BSA for 90 minutes, stained with the antibodies of interest at a concentration of 500nM overnight in 4°C, followed by staining with an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody and DAPI (1:5000). For fluorescent analysis of monolayers, DAPI normalized Alexa Fluor 488 signal was used to quantify the staining per well using a Synergy HTX plate reader (Biotek). For quantification of immunofluorescence staining, slides were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope. The mean fluorescence signal was calculated per cell using QuPath v0.2.0-m9.
ELISA reactions were carried out using flat-bottom MaxiSorp™ 96-well plates (Invitrogen). Antigen coating was performed in PBS at 100μl per well and left overnight at 4°C. For standard dose response ELISA assays, antigens were plated at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. The enzyme targets were expressed recombinantly, in house ( Udi et al. 2013 68. Udi, Y. ∙ Fragai, M. ∙ Grossman, M. ... Unraveling hidden allosteric regulatory sites in structurally homologues metalloproteases J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 :2330-2346 Google Scholar ). For comparative ELISA assays with multiple targets, antigens were plated at a constant molar concentration of 50nM. The plates were washed 5 times with a washing buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween-20) and incubated with 100μl blocking buffer (1× PBS with 1% BSA) for 1h at room temperature. The blocking solution was subsequently replaced by serial dilutions of either mono- or polyclonal antibodies or serum samples for 2.5h at RT. For standard dose response ELISA assays, antibodies were introduced over a range of dilutions whereas for ELISA screens, antibodies were used at 100nM. Serum samples were assayed at a dilution of 1:100. Plates were washed 5 times with a washing buffer and then incubated with anti-human IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson Immuno Research) in PBS at a 1:5,000 dilution. After washing the plates for an additional 5 times, the plates were developed using TMB (Thermo Fisher) and absorbance was measured at 630nm with an ELISA microplate reader (Synergy HTX plate reader, Biotek). ELISA assays for evaluating antibody polyreactivity were performed as previously described ( Prigent et al. 2016 55. Prigent, J. ∙ Lorin, V. ∙ Kök, A. ... Scarcity of autoreactive human blood IgA+ memory B cells Eur. J. Immunol. 2016; 46 :2340-2351 Google Scholar ). For peptide ELISA, the putative epitope sequence of mAb T13 was purchased as a biotinylated peptide from Genscript. Confirmation of peptide binding to mAbs T13 & T12 was performed by coating Maxisorp plates with 5μg/ml of the desired antibody overnight at 4C followed by blocking, incubation with different peptide dilutions, washing (X5), exposure to HRP conjugated streptavidin (1:2000), washing (X5) and TMB development.
Fresh HGSOC primary tumors retrieved from the operating theatre were immediately dissociated to a single cell suspension in growth medium (DMEM, 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) MEM-Eagle non essential amino acids, 1% (v/v) 2mM glutamine and 1% (v/v) Pen-Strep solution.) and placed on ice. Cells were washed in PBS and stained with the following antibodies: Alexa fluor 700 conjugated anti-human CD19 (Biolegend, clone: HIB19), PerCP/Cy5.5 conjugated anti-human CD38 (Biolegend, Clone: HIT2), APC conjugated anti-human IgG1 FC region (RD Systems, Clone: #97924), PE conjugated anti-human IgM (Biolegend, Clone: MHM-88). Samples were stained on ice for 45 minutes, washed and acquired using a Cytoflex flow cytometer and analysed using FlowJo 10.5.3. For immunoglobulin sequencing, tumor infiltrating CD19 + , CD38 ++ , IgM - , IgG1 + , ASCs originating from the primary tumors of 4 HGSOC patients also underwent single cell sorting into 96 well PCR plates containing 4ul per well of mRNA preserving lysis buffer (in RNAse free water, 10% DTT 0.1M v/v, 5% PBS X10 v/v, 7.5% RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor v/v, cat: N2615). Sorted plates were immediately frozen to -80C to preserve mRNA integrity. Single cell sorted tumor infiltrating ACSs were reverse transcribed and underwent nested PCR amplification and sequencing of their heavy and light chain transcripts as previously described ( Tiller et al., 2008 66. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expressionvector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Google Scholar ).
Ig Fasta sequences were aligned against the IMGT human heavy chain gene database (downloaded in Dec. 2019) and light chain gene database (downloaded in Feb. 2017) using NCBI IgBlast (version 1.14.0) ( Ye et al. 2013 82. Ye, J. ∙ Ma, N. ∙ Madden, T.L. ... IgBLAST: an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence analysis tool Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :W34-W40 Google Scholar ). Post processing of IgBlast output and clonal clustering were performed using Change-O v0.4.6 ( https://changeo.readthedocs.io ) ( Gupta et al., 2015 29. Gupta, N.T. ∙ Vander Heiden, J.A. ∙ Uduman, M. ... Change-O: A toolkit for analyzing large-scale B cell immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3356-3358 Google Scholar ), Alakazam v0.3.0 ( https://alakazam.readthedocs .), SHazaM v0.2.3 ( https://shazam.readthedocs.io ), and custom scripts within the R statistical computing environment, as follows. V(D)J sequences were assigned to clonal groups by partitioning sequences based on identity of IGHV gene annotations, IGHJ gene annotations, and junction region lengths. Within these groups, sequences differing from one another by more than 15 nucleotides between the V genes were defined as separate clones. Full-length germline sequences were reconstructed for each clone, with the D segment and nucleotide additions in the junction between the V-D and D-J segments) replaced with Ns. Lineage trees were constructed for each clone with at least two unique sequences using the Alakazam R package function, BuildPhylipLineage ( Gupta et al. 2015 29. Gupta, N.T. ∙ Vander Heiden, J.A. ∙ Uduman, M. ... Change-O: A toolkit for analyzing large-scale B cell immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3356-3358 Google Scholar ), which utilizes PHYLIP ( Felsenstein 2005 26. Felsenstein, J. PHYLIP (phylogeny Inference Package) 2005 Distributed by the Author (Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington). http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html Google Scholar ). In brief, maximum parsimony is a character-based approach that infers a phylogenetic tree by minimizing the total number of steps. The BuildPhylipLineage Alakazam function constructs the immunoglobulin phylogenetic trees through maximum parsimony by an external call to the dnapars (DNA Parsimony Program) application of the PHYLIP package. The dnapars program carries out unrooted parsimony on DNA sequences. It assumes that each site evolves independently, that different lineages evolve independently, that the probability of a base substitution at a given site is small over the lengths of time involved in a branch of the phylogeny, and that the expected degree of change in different branches of the phylogeny do not vary by so much that two changes in a high-rate branch are more probable than one change in a low-rate branch. Finally, the expected amounts of change do not vary so much among sites, so that two changes at one site would be more probable than one change at another. Following lineage tree generation, the dnapars output is changed to allow input sequences to appear as internal nodes of the tree. Intermediate sequences inferred by dnapars are replaced by progeny within the tree having a Hamming distance of zero from their parent node. The distance calculation allows IUPAC ambiguous character matches, where an ambiguous character has distance zero to any character in the set of characters it represents. Distance calculation and movement of downstream nodes up the tree are repeated until all parent-progeny pairs have a distance greater than zero between them. The germline sequence (outgroup) is moved to the base of the tree and excluded from the node replacement processes, which permits the trunk of the tree to be the only edge with a distance of zero. Edge weights of the resultant tree are assigned as the distance between each sequence. In selected cases, in which V-J configurations and junction lengths are identical between different sequences for both the heavy and light chains, yet the V genes differed by more than 15 nucleotides, members were manually clustered into single clones, though a common ancestry could not be assumed. Such relations appear with a dashed connecting line in lineage trees. Additionally, multiple identical sequences are treated as a single expanded clone. Selection quantification was calculated using BASELINe’s local test ( Yaari et al., 2012 80. Yaari, G. ∙ Uduman, M. ∙ Kleinstein, S.H. Quantifying selection in high-throughput immunoglobulin sequencing data sets Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :e134 Google Scholar ).
ASC immunoglobulin transcripts were chosen for cloning and expression on the basis of several criteria. These included: relation of the candidate to an expanded clone, occurrence of multiple identical clonal members, and high load of somatic hypermutations. Following selection of antibody candidates, constructs containing the heavy and light chain variable regions were produced as gBlocks by IDT and cloned into human IgG1, IgK and IgL expression vectors via the restriction free method. Cloning was performed into human IgG1, IgK and IgL expression vectors (AddGene, AbVec2.0-IGHG1, AbVec1.1-IGKC, AbVec1.1-IGLC2) using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, cat: M0530L) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The template plasmids were then selectively degraded using the DpnI restriction enzyme (NEB, cat: R0176L) for 16 hours at 37°C. Cloned vectors were transformed into DH5a competent bacteria (Real Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid containing bacteria were selected on the basis of vector-acquired ampicillin resistance. After plating, monoclonal bacterial colonies underwent PCR and sequencing validation of their transformed plasmids. Successfully transformed colonies were then expanded and harvested using Qiagen’s plasmid purification kit. Purified vectors were transfected into HEK293t cells in 150mm tissue culture plates (Corning) at 12.5ug/DNA per chain using linear 40kDa polyethyleneimine (at a DNA:PEI mass ratio of 1:2) and grown in serum free media for 5 days. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.2μm strainer and reacted with protein G Sepharose beads (17-0618-05, Cytiva/GE) on a tilt table, overnight at 4°C. Beads were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed in PBS and eluted using IgG elution buffer (21004, ThermoFisher) into TRIS pH 9 1M. The eluate was then dialyzed against PBS overnight and its final concentration measured using Nanodrop.
Analysis of the kinetic binding constants of mAb T13 to MMP14 was performed using the Octet QKe platform. Experiments were conducted at 30°C with shaking at 1,000 rpm. Antibody loading of mAb T13 was performed at an optimized pre-calibrated concentration of 12.5nM for 5 minutes in PBS. Loaded sensors were then exposed to TNC buffer (50mM Tris pH 8, 150mM NaCl, 5mM CaCl 2 ) for 30 seconds and 1 min in two adjacent wells. Next, MMP14 association was tested over a range of concentrations (30nM-2000nM), in TNC buffer for 30 minutes. Finally, antigen dissociation was followed in TNC buffer for 30 minutes. Data processing, construction of a response model and curve fitting was accomplished using the Fortebio Octet Data analysis software.
Cell lysates were made from cell lines and patient derived tumor specimens. Cell lines grown to confluence and minced tumor specimens were emulsified in 500ul of RIPA buffer (20mM Tris pH 7.4, 137mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% triton X-100, 2mM EDTA pH 8, 1mM PMSF, 20uM Leupeptin, in DDW) and protease inhibitor (1:100). Mixture was vortexed, agitated for 1 hour at 4°C and centrifuged. Supernatants were separated and flash frozen. Prior to the experiment, the protein concentration of the lysates was measured in triplicates using a BCA kit (Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit). Samples containing 25μg of protein were mixed with sample buffer in the presence of DTT, heated to 95°C for 5 minutes and introduced to 15-well gradient gels (Bio-Rad). The gel content was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the rapid transfer method. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (5% BSA, 0.1% tween in PBS) for 1 hour, at room temperature on a tilt table. The membranes were then exposed to the appropriate primary antibodies at 1 μg/ml in 5% BSA in PBS, overnight at 4°C on a tilt table. The next day, membranes were washed 3 times in wash buffer (0.1% tween in PBS), exposed to the appropriate isotype targeting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:5000 for 1 hour at room temperature, washed 3 times and developed using ECL. Antibody signals were acquired using the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Images were analysed using the Image Lab 6.0.1 software (Bio-Rad).
K562 cells were transfected with an mmp14 :mCherry expression vector using the TransIT-X2 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 0.5M K562 cells were plated in 6 well plates in 2.5ml of growth medium (DMEM, 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) MEM-Eagle non essential amino acids, 1% (v/v) 2mM glutamine and 1% (v/v) Pen-Strep solution) per well. For each condition, in a separate tube, 2.5μg of the mmp14 :Cherry vector and 7.5μl of the TransIT-X2 transfection reagent were mixed in 250ul of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Gibco) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the mixture was added to the cells in a drop-wise manner. A mock transfection without the mmp14 :mCherry construct was performed in parallel as a negative control. Following a 48 hr incubation, the cells were stained with 500nM T13 antibody for 45 minutes on ice, washed, stained with an Alexa fluor 488 conjugated anti human IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 minutes on ice, washed and analysed using a Cytoflex flow cytometer.
Biopanning was performed as previously described ( Freund et al., 2009 27. Freund ∙ Tarnovitski, N. ∙ Enshell-Seijffers, D. ... Phage display selection, analysis, and prediction of B cell epitopes Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2009; 9 :8 Google Scholar ). Briefly, approximately 1x1010 phages of the random-peptide library were mixed with 2 μg antibody in TBS x1 3% BSA solution (complete to 100μl) in 0.5 mL vials (AXYGEN, PCR-05-C) and incubated for 1 h on a rotating mixer at RT. Next, 30 μL of protein G coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen, DynabeadsTM Protein G) were added and the mix was incubated for 30 min on a rotating mixer at RT. The vials were then placed on a magnetic stand (Promega, MagneSphere® Technology Magnetic Separation Stands) for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded. The magnetically bound beads were washed 3 times with 200 μL wash buffer (TBS x1 0.5% Tween20), re-suspended in 100μl wash buffer, and transferred to a new vial. The vials were then placed on the magnetic stand and the supernatant was discarded. The bound phages were eluted twice with 105 μL of elution buffer (0.1M HCl adjusted to pH 2.2 with glycine, 1 mg/mL BSA) while rotating at RT for 10 min and neutralized with 19 μL of neutralizing buffer (1M Tris-HCl pH 9.1). Two additional rounds of amplification and biopanning were carried out for each screen. To confirm binding to affinity-selected phages, E. coli DH5αF+ were infected with the eluted affinity-selected phages and the bacteria were plated on LB with 20 μg/ml of tetracycline. Single colonies were picked and grown as mini-cultures in U-bottom 96-well cell culture plates (Corning Inc. Life Sciences). The plates were centrifuged to pellet the bacteria and the supernatants were transferred to 96-well flat bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One) containing poly-ethylene glycol/NaCl solution (33% PEG 3.3M NaCl) to precipitate the phages followed by another centrifugation step to pellet the phages. The phages were re-suspended in TBS x1, quantified, and used in dot blot to validate binding by the appropriate antibody. To introduce each sample with its own sample-barcode and the Illumina adaptors, separate, parallel PCR reactions were conducted. 1 μL of the eluted phages was mixed with 12.5 μL high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, PlatinumTM SuperFiTM PCR Master Mix), 10 pmol forward and reverse primers and supplemented with ultra-pure H2O for a total reaction volume of 25 μL. The thermal profile was as followed: 98°C for 2 min, 15 cycles of 98°C for 10 sec and 72°C for 5 sec. PCR products were validated by 2% agarose gel, purified by AMPure XP – PCR Purification (Beckman Coulter) and the concentration was measured using Qubit fluorometer. The samples were then diluted to 10 nM, merged, and sent for Illumina NGS sequencing.
Biotinylated MMP14 (2μg) protein was used to saturate the binding sites of 0.5mg 1μm fluorescent NeutrAvidin beads (Invitrogen). Excess antigen was removed by washing the beads, which were then blocked with 1% BSA. Next, the beads were washed and incubated with antibodies at final concentrations of 0.5μM (for monoclonal antibodies) or 1μM (for polyclonal antibodies) for 2h at 37°C. Following opsonization, beads were washed, and unbound antibodies were removed. The beads were then either stained for IgG to confirm IgG coating or incubated with phagocytic cells. For the phagocytosis assay, THP-1 cells were added, and the cells were incubated for 1h at 37°C to allow phagocytosis, after which the extent of phagocytosis was measured via flow cytometry (CytoFLEX). For IgG staining, the beads were incubated with anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research) in a blocking buffer at a 1:100 dilution for 30 minutes on ice. The beads were then washed, and the IgG was measured using the CytoFLEX flow cytometer.
Antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays were performed using xCelligence RTCA DP platform. Briefly, RTCA DP plates were filled with media and measured for background values. Then, OVCAR3 cells were plated at an optimized quantity of 20 ∗ 10 3 cells per well on RTCA DP plates. OVCAR3 cell proliferation during the seeding phase was monitored via their cell index value. 24 hours after seeding, the cells were incubated withmonoclonal or polyclonal antibodies at 500nM for 1 hour in PBS, and mixed with lymphokine activated donor natural killer cells at various effector to target (E:T) ratios. Upon introduction of the effector cells, the viability of the OVCAR3 tumor cell population was monitored over a 24-72 hour period. Prior to the ADCC assay, NK cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors using the EasySep human NK cell enrichment kit (STEMCELL), and activated by incubation in growth media in the presence of 500IU/ml human recombinant IL-2 overnight.
RNA-seq counts were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (Database: GEO: GSE102094 , Database: GEO: GSE71340 ). Differential expression analysis between HGSOC patients and normal tissues was performed by using DESeq2 (Love et al, Genome Biology, 2014 / 25516281).
Estimation of the risk for autoimmunity was performed based on data from the electronic health record (EHR) database from Clalit Healthcare Services ( Balicer and Afek 2017 6. Balicer, R.D. ∙ Afek, A. Digital health nation: Israel’s global big data innovation hub Lancet. 2017; 389 :2451-2453 Google Scholar ). In this analysis we evaluated women aged 40-80 years between 2005-2020. Two cohorts were defined: an autoimmune cohort and an ovarian cancer cohort. Female patients were included in the autoimmune cohort pending a previously documented ICD-9 code corresponding to the diagnosis of an autoimmune disease in their medical records. These included: systemic lupus erythematosus (710.0), rheumatoid arthritis (L88 / 714.5 / 714.2 / 714 / 714.0), systemic sclerosis and other forms of scleroderma (710.1 / 701.0), ankylosing spondylitis (720.0), dermatomyositis (710.3), polymyositis (710.4), Sjögren syndrome (710.2), psoriatic arthropathy (696.0), polyarteritis nodosa (446.0), chronic postrheumatic arthropathy (714.4), polymyalgia rheumatica (725), inflammatory polyarthropathy (714.9) and other rheumatic and connective tissue diseases (729 / 710 / 710.9 / 710.8 / 710.5). The onset of diagnosis was adjusted upon evidence of prior therapy for autoimmune diseases (methotrexate / hydroxychloroquine) or a diagnosis of palindromic rheumatism (719.3) in the three years preceding the diagnosis of autoimmunity. Female patients were included in the ovarian cancer cohort pending a previously documented ICD-9 code indicating a diagnosis of ovarian cancer in the patient’s medical records (ICD-9 codes: 183.9, 183.8, 183.2, 183.0, 183). The onset of ovarian cancer diagnosis was adjusted upon evidence of prior administration of chemotherapy (carboplatin / paclitaxel / topotecan) or traditional antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron) in the five years preceding the diagnosis. Onset was also adjusted in case of the following ICD 9 diagnoses: malignant neoplasm of uterus, part unspecified (179), unspecified malignant neoplasm (D77/ W72) and excision or destruction of peritoneal tissue (Z54.4) in the five years preceding the diagnosis - or - abdominal or pelvic swelling, mass or lump (789.3), ascites (789.5) or unspecified ovarian cyst (620.2) in the two years preceding the diagnosis. Patients with previous diagnoses of other malignancies were excluded as well as patients who had a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease preceding their ovarian cancer diagnosis. Controls were sampled from the general population and consisted of females who were not diagnosed with ovarian cancer and who were matched to the ovarian cancer cohort patients based on age and calendar year. In the ovarian cancer cohort and controls, the number of patients diagnosed with an autoimmune disease was counted during the followup period. The binomial estimate for the probability to have an autoimmune disease in a single month was calculated by dividing the number of patients who were diagnosed with an autoimmune disease in a given cohort, by the cumulative number of patient-months available in a given follow up period. The ovarian cancer cohort included 3,353 patients contributing up to 179,555 patient months to the analysis, while the control included 43,589 matched controls contributing up to 2,549,627 patient months. Thus, an annual incidence rate was calculated per 100,000 patients as well as a confidence interval, for followup periods of 1, 5, 10 and 15 years.
Human Protein Microarray (ProtoArray) was used to measure antibody binding against a panel of proteins absorbed on the surface (Cat #PAH05251020, Invitrogen). Microarrays were blocked for 1 hour at RT with 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated under a coverslip overnight at 4°C with 10 μg patient purified antibodies in blocking buffer (2% BSA in TBS). The arrays were then washed (X3 with 0.05% Tween20) and incubated for 2 hour at RT with a goat anti-human IgG Cy3-conjugated antibody ((1:250), Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc, CAT#109-165-003.). The arrays were then washed (X3 with 0.05% Tween20), dried and scanned using InnoScan 710 (INNOPSYS) at 532 nm.
For each spot, the intensity was defined as the mean fluorescence intensity minus the localized background intensity (denoted F532-B532). Then, the average of two technical replicates in each chip was normalized by its median reactivity to account for differences in total protein concentrations that affect the background intensity level. The amount of material deposited in each spot was provided by the manufacturer based on the measurement of the GST tag of the absorbed protein. Signal intensity for each spot was then normalized to the GST signal. Proteins that contained a region from human Fc region (as indicated by the manufacturer) which can be bound by secondary anti-human Fc were not included in the analysis.
The clinical data was collected from the medical records of 34 recruited HGSOC patients for whom FFPE specimens of their primary tumor were available. In order to minimize potential biases, the cohort of patients was designed to be as homogenous as possible in terms of disease progression and survival-influencing factors – such as disease stage at presentation, debulking status and adjuvant treatment. All the patients recruited underwent primary debulking surgery (total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) without receiving prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Following surgery, all patients received taxane and platinum-based standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients were regularly followed up by their gyneco-oncologists. Of note, none of the patients recruited experienced intraoperative or perioperative complications or perished from aetiologies unrelated to their malignancy. Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time interval between diagnosis and death, or last follow-up if the patient did not succumb to her disease. Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated as the time between primary surgery and the date in which the first objective evidence of recurrence was recorded, or last follow up if the patient did not experience disease recurrence. One patient was omitted from the PFS analysis due to inconclusive data relating to her date of disease recurrence. OS and PFS were correlated to data retrieved from immunofluorescence staining of the primary tumors, namely, the percentage of IgG coated tumor cells and the abundance of IgG + ASCs in the tumor microenvironment. Tumors which exhibited positive IgG staining in less than 10% of their cells were consideredIgG - , whereas staining equal to or greater than 10% was considered IgG + . For infiltration of IgG + ASCs, an average number of 100 IgG + ASCs per high power field (HPF) was established as the threshold value. This was determined following computational quantification of IgG + ASCs in three independent HPFs per patient. These data were used to construct Kaplan-Meier curves. Statistical significance between the curves was determined using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
The amino acid sequence of T13 antibody VDJ region
(VH:EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFIFSKHDMYWVRQRPGKGLEWVSRIGDAGDTYYAGSVKGRFTIFRENAKNTLYFQMNRLTDGDTAVYYCGRGMAVAGFPLDVWGRGTRVTVTS;
VL:EIVMTQSPATLSVSPGERATLSCRASQNIHINLAWYQQKPGQAPRLIIYAASTRAAGIPARFSASGSGTEFTLTISSLQSEDFAVYYCQQFNPWSPWTFGQGTKVEVK) was computed on the ”advanced” Google Colab cloud interface using the AlphaFold framework ( Jumper et al. 2021 33. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Google Scholar ). Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were generated using MMseqs2 and analysis resulted in five models that were sorted by their pLDDT score. The top-ranked model was then docked to MMP14 (PDB 5H0U ) via Global Docking analysis using the PatchDock algorithm ( Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2005 62. Schneidman-Duhovny, D. ∙ Inbar, Y. ∙ Nussinov, R. ... PatchDock and SymmDock: servers for rigid and symmetric docking Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :W363-W367 Google Scholar ) followed by protein-protein refinement stage on the FireDock server ( Mashiach et al. 2008 41. Mashiach, E. ∙ Schneidman-Duhovny, D. ∙ Andrusier, N. ... FireDock: A web server for fast interaction refinement in molecular docking Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :W229-W232 Google Scholar ). Final complexes were assessed for their binding site and cross-referenced with the phage display hits.
The D'Agostino-Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were employed to assess the normality of our data. Normally and near-normally distributed datasets were evaluated using parametric statistical tests such as one way ANOVA and student’s paired / unpaired t-test, as appropriate. Normality was assumed in datasets which were too small to be tested for normality. Non-normally distributed datasets were mainly of lognormal distribution. These datasets were tested using non-parametric tests such as the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann–Whitney U test. Post-hoc analyses were performed following each relevant test. For one way ANOVA, we used Dunnett’s post-hoc test and for Kruskal-Wallis test, we used Dunn’s post-hoc test. For survival analyses, we used the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test to determine the difference between Kaplan Meier plots. Correlation between datasets composed of continuous variables was performed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and fitting of a linear regression model. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2.
