Title: Structural basis and regulation of the reductive stress response


Abstract: Summary

Although oxidative phosphorylation is best known for producing ATP, it also yields reactive oxygen species (ROS) as invariant byproducts. Depletion of ROS below their physiological levels, a phenomenon known as reductive stress, impedes cellular signaling and has been linked to cancer, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy. Cells alleviate reductive stress by ubiquitylating and degrading the mitochondrial gatekeeper FNIP1, yet it is unknown how the responsible E3 ligase CUL2 FEM1B can bind its target based on redox state and how this is adjusted to changing cellular environments. Here, we show that CUL2 FEM1B relies on zinc as a molecular glue to selectively recruit reduced FNIP1 during reductive stress. FNIP1 ubiquitylation is gated by pseudosubstrate inhibitors of the BEX family, which prevent premature FNIP1 degradation to protect cells from unwarranted ROS accumulation. FEM1B gain-of-function mutation and BEX deletion elicit similar developmental syndromes, showing that the zinc-dependent reductive stress response must be tightly regulated to maintain cellular and organismal homeostasis.

Section: Introduction

Mitochondria possess crucial roles in metabolism and signaling that ensure tissue formation and homeostasis ( Chandel, 2015 10. Chandel, N.S.

Cell Biol. 2020; 219 :e202002179 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Central among their many functions is oxidative phosphorylation, which produces ATP to sustain a cell’s energy balance ( Lisowski et al., 2018 45. Lisowski, P. ∙ Kannan, P. ∙ Mlody, B. ... Mitochondria and the dynamic control of stem cell homeostasis EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :e45432 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because ATP requirements can change, cells must constantly adjust oxidative phosphorylation to their needs, as illustrated by differentiating cells that activate mitochondrial ATP synthesis to fulfill the escalating energy demands of cell fate specification ( Beckervordersandforth et al., 2017 5. Beckervordersandforth, R. ∙ Ebert, B. ∙ Schäffner, I. ...

Dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation accordingly impedes development ( Gorman et al., 2016 26. Gorman, G.S. ∙ Chinnery, P.F. ∙ DiMauro, S. ... Mitochondrial diseases Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2016; 2 :16080 Crossref Scopus (978) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet how this process is tuned to the necessities of tissue formation and homeostasis is still incompletely understood.
In addition to ATP, oxidative phosphorylation yields reactive oxygen species (ROS) as invariant byproducts. Mutations in components of the electron transport chain, abrupt changes in the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, or environmental toxins can increase ROS to levels that damage proteins, lipids, or DNA ( Sies et al., 2017 71. Sies, H. ∙ Berndt, C. ∙ Jones, D.P. Oxidative Stress Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86 :715-748 Crossref Scopus (2280) PubMed Google Scholar ). If unmitigated, such oxidative stress exhausts stem cell populations, accelerates aging, and results in cancer or neurodegeneration ( Corenblum et al., 2016 12.

Cells sense oxidative stress through the E3 ligase CUL3 KEAP1 , which is inhibited by ROS-dependent oxidation of Cys residues in KEAP1 ( Dinkova-Kostova et al., 2002 18.

Inhibition of CUL3 KEAP1 prevents the degradation of the transcription factor NRF2 and thereby instigates an antioxidant gene expression program.
While overabundant ROS elicit oxidative stress, their persistent depletion leads to the opposite condition known as reductive stress ( Gores et al., 1989 25. Gores, G.J. ∙ Flarsheim, C.E. ∙ Dawson, T.L. ... Swelling, reductive stress, and cell death during chemical hypoxia in hepatocytes Am. J.

Mitochondria as intracellular signaling platforms in health and disease J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219 :e202002179 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reductive stress can be caused by inactive oxidative phosphorylation or prolonged antioxidant signaling ( Best and Sutherland, 2018 7.

Cell Res. 2018; 1865 :721-733 Crossref Scopus (1261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells detect reductive stress through the FNIP1 protein, which contains three conserved Cys residues that are selectively reduced upon ROS depletion ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). The E3 ligase CUL2 FEM1B ubiquitylates reduced FNIP1 to trigger its proteasomal degradation, which allows cells to re-activate oxidative phosphorylation and replenish their ROS supply. Key to the reductive stress response is the ability of CUL2 FEM1B to distinguish reduced from oxidized FNIP1 ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ) but how an E3 ligase can discriminate targets based on redox state remains unknown.
Underscoring the importance of the reductive stress response, mutations in its core components impede development and cause disease. Loss of FNIP1 inhibits B cell differentiation and causes agammaglobulinemia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( Baba et al., 2012 4. Baba, M. ∙ Keller, J.R. ∙ Sun, H.W. ... The folliculin-FNIP1 pathway deleted in human Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is required for murine B-cell development Blood. 2012; 120 :1254-1261 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saettini et al., 2021 67. Saettini, F. ∙ Poli, C. ∙ Vengoechea, J. ... Absent B cells, agammaglobulinemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in folliculin interacting protein 1 deficiency Blood. 2021; 137 :493-499 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas heterozygous mutation of the R126 residue in FEM1B results in syndromic global developmental delay with intellectual disability ( Lecoquierre et al., 2019 42. Lecoquierre, F. ∙ Duffourd, Y. ∙ Vitobello, A. ..., Orphanomix Physician’s Group Variant recurrence in neurodevelopmental disorders: the use of publicly available genomic data identifies clinically relevant pathogenic missense variants Genet. Med. 2019; 21 :2504-2511 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because deletion of a single FEM1B allele in mice did not reveal phenotypes ( Lu et al., 2005 46. Lu, D. ∙ Ventura-Holman, T. ∙ Li, J. ... Abnormal glucose homeostasis and pancreatic islet function in mice with inactivation of the Fem1b gene Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25 :6570-6577 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), mutation of R126 likely exerts a gain of function that disrupts development. This suggested that reductive stress signaling must be strictly controlled, yet regulators of this pathway have not been identified.
Here, we report the structural basis and regulation of the reductive stress response. Using X-ray crystallography, we found that CUL2 FEM1B relies on zinc to selectively bind reduced, but not oxidized, FNIP1. Zinc functions in analogy to molecular glues that elicit protein degradation in a therapeutic setting ( Jevtić et al., 2021 35. Jevtić, P. ∙ Haakonsen, D.L. ∙ Rapé, M.

Biol. 2021; 28 :1000-1013 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ; Petzold et al., 2016 61. Petzold, G. ∙ Fischer, E.S. ∙ Thomä, N.H.

Commun. 2019; 10 :1402 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the critical residue in disease, R126, is located within the substrate binding pocket of FEM1B, it does not engage FNIP1 but recruits BEX proteins as pseudosubstrate inhibitors of CUL2 FEM1B . Loss of BEX genes in patients with Xq22 deletion and mutation of R126 in FEM1B cause similar developmental syndromes ( Hijazi et al., 2020 28. Hijazi, H. ∙ Coelho, F.S. ∙ Gonzaga-Jauregui, C. ...

Med. 2019; 21 :2504-2511 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), showing that regulation of the reductive stress response plays a crucial role in ensuring tissue formation.

Section: Results

Reductive stress signaling relies on the selective recognition of reduced FNIP1 by CUL2 FEM1B ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). To reveal the molecular basis of this signaling circuit, we identified a FEM1B construct with six annotated ankyrin repeats and one TPR repeat that was sufficient to capture the FNIP1 degron ( Figure S1 A). We purified the complex between this FEM1B construct and a 30-residue FNIP1 degron to homogeneity ( Figure S1 B) and determined its X-ray crystal structure to a resolution of 2.9 Å ( Figures 1 A and S1 C–S1G; Table S1 ).
Consistent with recent work ( Chen et al., 2021 11. Chen, X. ∙ Liao, S. ∙ Makaros, Y. ... Molecular basis for arginine C-terminal degron recognition by Cul2(FEM1) E3 ligase Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; 17 :254-262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), the ankyrin repeats of FEM1B combined with an amino-terminal ankyrin-like repeat to form a crescent-shaped molecule that is capped on its carboxy terminus by helix-turn-helix and TPR motifs ( Figure 1 B). Of the four FEM1B molecules in the asymmetric unit, two showed clear density for a bound degron ( Figures S1 D, S1E, and S2 A). The structures of all FEM1B molecules in the asymmetric unit were highly similar to each other ( Figure S2 A), and FEM1B adopted the same conformation without substrate or when in complex with a distinct target, a C-end rule degron ( Chen et al., 2021 11. Chen, X. ∙ Liao, S. ∙ Makaros, Y. ... Molecular basis for arginine C-terminal degron recognition by Cul2(FEM1) E3 ligase Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; 17 :254-262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggested that substrate binding does not elicit major conformational changes in FEM1B.
FEM1B engages its critical target FNIP1 in a deep groove on its concave side ( Figure 1 A), which places the substrate close to residues of both the ankyrin repeats and TPR motif. FEM1B binds FNIP1 through a surface that is similar to several other ankyrin-repeat proteins ( DaRosa et al., 2018 17. DaRosa, P.A. ∙ Klevit, R.E. ∙ Xu, W.

Crystal structure of the CSL-Notch-Mastermind ternary complex bound to DNA Cell. 2006; 124 :985-996 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 B) but distinct from the ankyrin-repeat E3 ligase CUL5 ASB9 ( Lumpkin et al., 2020 47. Lumpkin, R.J. ∙ Baker, R.W. ∙ Leschziner, A.E. ... Structure and dynamics of the ASB9 CUL-RING E3 Ligase Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2866 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 C). To gain access to its binding pocket on FEM1B, FNIP1 forms an extended loop that is characterized by a sharp turn imposed by a Pro residue ( Figures 1 A and 1B). This loop orients the three conserved Cys residues of the FNIP1 degron toward FEM1B. Although the FNIP1 loop docks onto a similar region of FEM1B as the C-end rule degron, it does not engage several FEM1B residues critical for C-end rule recognition ( Figure S2 D).
Despite its similarities with other ankyrin-repeat proteins, CUL2 FEM1B uses a distinct mechanism to recognize its substrate. Most proteins rely on interactions between amino acid side chains or the peptide backbone to engage their targets. In stark contrast, the complex between FEM1B and FNIP1 is predominantly mediated by two Zn 2+ ions coordinated at the interface between FEM1B and the tip of the FNIP1 degron loop ( Figures 1 A, S1 F, and S1G). We detected Zn 2+ in FEM1B-FNIP1 complexes by X-ray diffraction ( Figure S3 A), X-ray fluorescence ( Figure S3 B), and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy ( Figure S3 C). When we removed zinc by N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN), binding of FNIP1 to recombinant FEM1B was lost in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 1 C and 1D), whereas increasing Zn 2+ levels allowed FEM1B to bind more FNIP1 ( Figure 1 D). Only Zn 2+ , but not several other metal ions, was able to stabilize the FEM1B-FNIP1 interaction ( Figure S3 D).
Consistent with these biochemical data, reducing cellular zinc levels with TPEN prevented substrate binding by FEM1B without disrupting the integrity of CUL2 FEM1B ( Figure 1 E). A flow cytometry assay, which measures the abundance of GFP fused to the FNIP1 degron (GFP degron ) ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), accordingly revealed that TPEN protected FNIP1 from FEM1B-induced degradation ( Figure 1 F). The same treatment did not affect a reporter that is turned over through CUL4 CRBN ( Figure S3 E), although this E3 ligase shares the RING subunit RBX1 with CUL2 FEM1B ( Fischer et al., 2014 24. Fischer, E.S. ∙ Böhm, K. ∙ Lydeard, J.R. ... Structure of the DDB1-CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase in complex with thalidomide Nature. 2014; 512 :49-53 Crossref Scopus (733) PubMed Google Scholar ). At our concentrations, TPEN therefore strongly inhibited substrate binding by CUL2 FEM1B , yet it did not extract zinc from the RING domain. We conclude that interface zinc ions play an essential role in mediating FNIP1 recognition by CUL2 FEM1B .
Most proteins bind zinc through Cys or His residues ( Kocyła et al., 2021 40. Kocyła, A. ∙ Tran, J.B. ∙ Krężel, A. Galvanization of Protein-Protein Interactions in a Dynamic Zinc Interactome Trends Biochem. Sci. 2021; 46 :64-79 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with this notion, the zinc ions at the interface between FEM1B and FNIP1 are coordinated by one Cys (C186) and two His residues (H185 and H218) of FEM1B and three Cys residues (C580, C582, and C585) and one histidine (H587) of FNIP1 ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Compared to its apo-structure ( Chen et al., 2021 11. Chen, X. ∙ Liao, S. ∙ Makaros, Y. ... Molecular basis for arginine C-terminal degron recognition by Cul2(FEM1) E3 ligase Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; 17 :254-262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ), both His residues of FEM1B rotate toward the metal ions in the FEM1B-FNIP1 complex ( Figure S4 A). This results in a C3H1 motif to coordinate one zinc, whereas the adjacent ion is chelated by a C2H2 motif.
Mutation of FNIP1-C580, C582, or H587, which engage one zinc, impaired detection of the FNIP1 degron by FEM1B, whereas mutation of FNIP1-C585, which is located between both zinc ions, abrogated FNIP1 recognition ( Figure 2 C). Simultaneous mutation of C580 and C582, which bind one zinc each, also blocked capture of FNIP1 by recombinant FEM1B. In a similar manner, C186 of FEM1B was essential for FNIP1 recognition in vitro ( Figure 2 D). As expected from these experiments, mutation of the Zn 2+ -coordinating Cys residues of FNIP1 strongly impaired substrate ubiquitylation by recombinant NEDD8-modified CUL2 FEM1B ( Figure 2 E).
In cells, all Zn 2+ -binding residues in FEM1B were required for recognition of endogenous FNIP1 ( Figure 2 F). We had previously found that mutation of C580, C582, or H587 in FNIP1 also obliterated its binding to FEM1B in cells ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ); because mutation of these residues only impeded degron recognition in vitro ( Figure 2 C), reduced flexibility of full-length FNIP1 bound to FLCN might impose even stricter Zn 2+ dependency on substrate recognition by CUL2 FEM1B . In line with these binding studies, mutation of C186 in FEM1B blocked turnover of the GFP degron reporter ( Figure 2 G), and all Zn 2+ -binding residues of FEM1B were required for efficient degradation of a sensitized reporter built around the FNIP1-C582S degron ( Figure 2 H). By contrast, mutation of FEM1B residues involved in detection of the C-end rule substrate did not inhibit GFP degron turnover ( Figure S4 B), and conversely, C186 of FEM1B was not required for degradation of a C-end rule reporter ( Figure S4 C). We conclude that Zn 2+ acts in analogy to molecular glues to recruit CUL2 FEM1B to its reductive stress substrate, FNIP1. Because only reduced, but not oxidized, Cys residues can chelate Zn 2+ ( Evans et al., 2002 23. Evans, J.C. ∙ Huddler, D.P. ∙ Jiracek, J. ... Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase: zinc in a distorted barrel Structure. 2002; 10 :1159-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmalen et al., 2014 69. Schmalen, I. ∙ Reischl, S. ∙ Wallach, T. ... Interaction of circadian clock proteins CRY1 and PER2 is modulated by zinc binding and disulfide bond formation Cell. 2014; 157 :1203-1215 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ), these findings provide an explanation for the redox-sensitive detection of FNIP1 by CUL2 FEM1B .
Despite the strict conservation of its degron Cys residues, a FNIP1 reporter with its essential C585 moved by five positions was still degraded through CUL2 FEM1B ( Figure S4 D). This indicated that FEM1B can recognize multiple conformations adopted by a flexible degron loop. Because cells express many proteins with Cys- and His-rich regions, we hypothesized that additional features of the FEM1B-FNIP1 interface contribute to the specificity of this interaction. Indeed, our structure revealed that a conserved Tyr residue, Y584, docks into a FEM1B pocket that is adjacent to the zinc interface ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Y584 of FNIP1 as well as an upstream Lys residue, K583, form interactions with FEM1B Ile341, Met220, Glu228, Ser229, and the peptide bond oxygen of Val225.
Mutation of K583 and Y584 of FNIP1 impaired, but did not block, recognition of the degron by FEM1B in vitro ( Figure 3 C), while these variants showed strongly reduced ubiquitylation by recombinant CUL2 FEM1B ( Figure 3 D). The degron residues K583 and Y584, which we refer to as the KY-finger, are therefore important, yet not essential, for FNIP1 recognition by FEM1B. In line with this notion, K583 or Y584 were required for the CUL2 FEM1B -dependent degradation of the sensitized FNIP1-C582S degron reporter ( Figure 3 E), although an otherwise wild-type GFP degron was turned over in the presence of these mutations ( Figure S4 E). Similar observations were made for the respective residues of FEM1B: mutation of Glu196, Met220, Val225, and Glu228 abolished FEM1B-dependent degradation of FNIP1-C582S, but not the wild-type GFP degron , reporter ( Figures 3 F and S4 F). From these results, we infer that the KY-finger of FNIP1 docks into a FEM1B pocket and likely orients the degron on the E3 surface for efficient ubiquitylation.
Given the conservation of FEM1B’s substrate binding pocket ( Figure 4 A), we were surprised to see that FNIP1 only occupies part of this surface. Instead of contacting FNIP1, FEM1B residues in the remaining pocket coordinate a buffer HEPES molecule ( Figures 4 A–4C). FEM1B R126, whose mutation causes syndromic developmental delay ( Lecoquierre et al., 2019 42. Lecoquierre, F. ∙ Duffourd, Y. ∙ Vitobello, A. ..., Orphanomix Physician’s Group Variant recurrence in neurodevelopmental disorders: the use of publicly available genomic data identifies clinically relevant pathogenic missense variants Genet. Med. 2019; 21 :2504-2511 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), bound the charged HEPES sulfonate group ( Figures 4 B and 4C). The neighboring S122 of FEM1B formed an additional hydrogen bond to the sulfonate group of HEPES ( Figure 4 C), whereas the remainder of this molecule was tucked into a pocket established by several hydrophobic and aromatic residues of FEM1B.
As expected from its limited interactions with FNIP1, mutation of R126 did not prevent binding of recombinant FEM1B to the FNIP1 degron ( Figure 4 D), and FEM1B R126A ubiquitylated FNIP1 with similar efficiency as FEM1B ( Figure 4 E). Replacing HEPES with Tris, which cannot be bound by R126, also did not impact the affinity of FEM1B to the FNIP1 degron ( Figure S5 A). In striking contrast, FEM1B R126Q and FEM1B R126A bound FNIP1-FLCN much better than wild-type FEM1B in cells ( Figure 4 F), and both variants triggered degradation of the FNIP1 reporter much more efficiently than their wild-type counterpart ( Figure 4 G). These effects were specific for FNIP1, as FEM1B and FEM1B R126A targeted a C-end rule degron reporter with similar efficiency ( Figure S5 B). Consistent with the heterozygous FEM1B mutation in disease ( Lecoquierre et al., 2019 42. Lecoquierre, F. ∙ Duffourd, Y. ∙ Vitobello, A. ..., Orphanomix Physician’s Group Variant recurrence in neurodevelopmental disorders: the use of publicly available genomic data identifies clinically relevant pathogenic missense variants Genet. Med. 2019; 21 :2504-2511 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), loss of R126 therefore results in a gain of function toward FNIP1 in cells, even though it did not impact recognition in purified settings.
We hypothesized that an inhibitory factor, which is absent from reconstituted systems but can engage FEM1B in cells, accounts for the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes of R126 mutations. We thus used affinity purification and mass spectrometry to search for proteins bound by FEM1B, but not FEM1B R126A . In these experiments, we also mutated L597 of FEM1B, which inhibits integration of FEM1B into the CUL2 module and allowed us to monitor FEM1B substrates ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with our previous results, FEM1B R126A/L597A bound FNIP1 and its partner FLCN more efficiently than FEM1B L597A ( Figure 5 A). Because this increased interaction of FNIP1 was lost upon concomitant mutation of FEM1B-C186, FEM1B R126 variants recognize FNIP1 through the canonical substrate binding site ( Figure S6 A). These observations supported the notion that R126 of FEM1B is critical for recruiting an inhibitor of reductive stress signaling.
Pointing toward this potential inhibitor, FEM1B R126 variants failed to bind all five BEX proteins ( Figure 5 A). The BEX proteins are encoded by a eutherian-specific gene cluster, whose products have been ascribed a wide range of functions in cell proliferation and survival ( Navas-Pérez et al., 2020 55. Navas-Pérez, E. ∙ Vicente-García, C. ∙ Mirra, S. ... Characterization of an eutherian gene cluster generated after transposon domestication identifies Bex3 as relevant for advanced neurological functions Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :267 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most intriguingly, BEX genes are lost in patients of Xq22 deletion syndrome, a developmental delay and intellectual disability syndrome that is similar to that caused by R126 mutation in FEM1B ( Hijazi et al., 2020 28. Hijazi, H. ∙ Coelho, F.S. ∙ Gonzaga-Jauregui, C. ... Xq22 deletions and correlation with distinct neurological disease traits in females: Further evidence for a contiguous gene syndrome Hum. Mutat. 2020; 41 :150-168 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using affinity purification and western blotting, we confirmed that FEM1B bound multiple BEX proteins dependent upon R126 of FEM1B ( Figures 5 B, 5C, and S6 B). Endogenous FEM1B associated particularly well with BEX2 and BEX3, which occupied ∼60% of FEM1B molecules in 293T cells ( Figures 5 D and S6 C). Because BEX2 recognized FEM1B in vitro , the BEX proteins and FEM1B directly engage each other ( Figure S6 D).
The BEX proteins did not bind the FEM1B homolog, FEM1A ( Figure S6 E), which lacks zinc-chelating residues ( Chen et al., 2021 11. Chen, X. ∙ Liao, S. ∙ Makaros, Y. ... Molecular basis for arginine C-terminal degron recognition by Cul2(FEM1) E3 ligase Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; 17 :254-262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koren et al., 2018 41. Koren, I. ∙ Timms, R.T. ∙ Kula, T. ... The Eukaryotic Proteome Is Shaped by E3 Ubiquitin Ligases Targeting C-Terminal Degrons Cell. 2018; 173 :1622-1635 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, mutation of C186 in FEM1B impaired recognition of BEX2 or BEX3 ( Figures 5 C and S6 B). Mutation of a Cys in BEX3, or deletion of 15 carboxy-terminal residues that contain this Cys as well as a cluster of His residues, impaired the interaction of BEX3 with FEM1B ( Figures 5 E and S6 F), and zinc chelation with 1,10-phenanthroline blocked the remaining interaction of BEX2 with FEM1B R126A in vitro ( Figure S6 D). This suggested that the BEX proteins might not only engage R126 of FEM1B but also the Zn 2+ -dependent part of the substrate binding pocket.
To directly test for a role of Zn 2+ in complex formation, we synthesized a TAMRA-labeled peptide of the BEX3 carboxy-terminus (CTP) and monitored its recognition by FEM1B using fluorescence polarization. FEM1B bound the CTP with high affinity (K D ∼15 nM) and a Hill coefficient of ∼4, which is indicative of cooperative binding to multiple sites ( Figures 5 F–5H). Mutation of either R126 or C186 of FEM1B strongly reduced, and mutation of both residues ablated, association of FEM1B with the CTP. Moreover, as TPEN abolished CTP binding to FEM1B R126A , yet had no effect on the residual CTP binding by FEM1B C186S , Zn 2+ detection by C186 of FEM1B is important for the recruitment of BEX proteins. We conclude that BEX proteins engage both R126 and the Zn 2+ binding site of FEM1B. While mutation of R126 in FEM1B promotes substrate recognition in cells, it strongly diminishes the interaction of FEM1B with BEX proteins.
In line with the BEX proteins being inhibitors of CUL2 FEM1B , expression of BEX2 or BEX3 blocked the ability of FEM1B to induce degradation of the FNIP1 reporter ( Figures 6 A and S7 A). BEX3 also stabilized the C-end rule degron that is recognized through a similar FEM1B surface ( Figures S4 C and S5 B). Both BEX3 C108S and a BEX3 variant lacking carboxy-terminal His residues were unable to efficiently prevent GFP degron turnover ( Figure 6 B). Because overexpression of FNIP1 did not stabilize the GFP degron reporter ( Figure S7 B), the inhibitory effect of BEX proteins onto FNIP1 degradation was unlikely to be caused by mere competition for access to their shared binding site on FEM1B.
Complementing our overexpression studies, depletion of BEX3 was sufficient to improve GFP degron degradation through endogenous or co-expressed FEM1B ( Figures 6 C, 6D and S7 C), to an extent similar to the accelerated FNIP1 degradation during reductive stress ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). The increased turnover of GFP degron in cells lacking BEX3 was dependent on the degron Cys residues ( Figure 6 D). Similar observations were made for complex formation: induction of BEX2, BEX3, or BEX4 inhibited the recognition of FNIP1 by FEM1B ( Figures 5 B and 6 E), yet BEX3 C108S or BEX3 4H/A had little effect onto FNIP1-FEM1B complex formation ( Figure 5 E). Interestingly, although BEX1 did not prevent FNIP1 detection by FEM1B, its CTP fused to the rest of BEX3 was sufficient to block FNIP1 recognition ( Figure 6 E). The CTP of BEX proteins is therefore a conserved motif that is required, but not sufficient, for CUL2 FEM1B inhibition.
Also in vitro , recombinant BEX2 efficiently prevented recognition of the FNIP1 degron by FEM1B ( Figures 6 F and 6G). BEX2 accordingly blocked FNIP1 ubiquitylation by recombinant CUL2 FEM1B , whereas BEX2 itself was not significantly ubiquitylated under these conditions ( Figure 6 H). Together, these experiments revealed that the BEX proteins occupy the substrate binding pocket of FEM1B and inhibit FNIP1 ubiquitylation without being efficiently modified themselves. We conclude that the BEX proteins are pseudosubstrate inhibitors of CUL2 FEM1B .
Because FEM1B R126Q did not bind BEX proteins in cells, we speculated that the pathological variant is resistant to pseudosubstrate inhibition. This hypothesis would be consistent with mutation of R126 of FEM1B and deletion of BEX genes eliciting similar developmental syndromes ( Hijazi et al., 2020 28. Hijazi, H. ∙ Coelho, F.S. ∙ Gonzaga-Jauregui, C. ... Xq22 deletions and correlation with distinct neurological disease traits in females: Further evidence for a contiguous gene syndrome Hum. Mutat. 2020; 41 :150-168 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lecoquierre et al., 2019 42. Lecoquierre, F. ∙ Duffourd, Y. ∙ Vitobello, A. ..., Orphanomix Physician’s Group Variant recurrence in neurodevelopmental disorders: the use of publicly available genomic data identifies clinically relevant pathogenic missense variants Genet. Med. 2019; 21 :2504-2511 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, in contrast to wild-type FEM1B, mutant FEM1B R126Q or FEM1B R126A could still trigger GFP degron degradation in the presence of BEX proteins ( Figures 6 A and S7 A). Although BEX3 expression prevented binding of FEM1B to FNIP1 in cells, FEM1B R126Q and FEM1B R126A mutants still associated with FNIP1 under these conditions ( Figures 5 C and S6 B). In vitro , FEM1B R126A retained its ability to detect the FNIP1 degron in the presence of BEX2, ( Figures 6 F and 6G), and CUL2 complexes programmed with FEM1B R126A continued to ubiquitylate the FNIP1 degron despite the presence of BEX2 ( Figure 6 H). R126 mutants of FEM1B are therefore impaired in their regulation by BEX proteins, which could account for their gain of function phenotype in disease.
Having identified BEX proteins as regulators of CUL2 FEM1B , we wished to assess their contribution to ROS management. Following our initial work on reductive stress signaling ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), we first investigated BEX proteins in myoblasts. In this cell type, loss of FEM1B stabilizes FNIP1 and reduces mitochondrial ROS production, yet it also leads to nuclear exclusion of the NRF2 transcription factor ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mirroring the consequences of FEM1B depletion, overexpression of BEX3, but not the FEM1B-binding-deficient mutant BEX3 C108S , caused re-localization of stabilized NRF2 from the nucleus to perinuclear regions ( Figure 7 A).
In contrast to myoblasts, 293T cells respond to FEM1B depletion by stabilizing FNIP1 without affecting NRF2. Accordingly, loss of FEM1B slightly decreased ROS levels ( Figure 7 B), as expected for impaired oxidative phosphorylation in a cell type that mainly uses mitochondria for anaplerotic purposes ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). The depletion of four BEX proteins, BEX1–BEX4, caused the opposite phenotype and increased ROS, indicative of stimulated oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 7 B). A similar observation was made upon stable expression of FEM1B R126Q , which is defective in binding to BEX proteins and caused a premature loss of endogenous FNIP1 ( Figure 7 C), a rise in ROS ( Figure 7 D), and increased oxygen consumption indicative of more active oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 7 E). Because FEM1B R126Q/C186S/L597A , which neither binds BEX proteins nor ubiquitylates FNIP1, did not display these phenotypes, it is degradation of FEM1B targets that accounts for the high ROS levels and oxygen consumption in the absence of pseudosubstrate regulation. Importantly, FEM1B R126Q , but not the substrate-binding deficient FEM1B R126Q/C186S/L587A , strongly delayed proliferation of 293T cells ( Figure 7 F), showing that tight control of the zinc-dependent reductive stress response through the BEX proteins is critical for cellular homeostasis.

Section: Discussion

As the key step of the reductive stress response, the E3 ligase CUL2 FEM1B selectively ubiquitylates the reduced FNIP1 that is generated upon persistent ROS depletion. The ensuing degradation of this mitochondrial gatekeeper activates oxidative phosphorylation and thereby allows cells to replenish their ROS and, likely, ATP supplies. This study reveals both the structural basis and regulation of this pivotal developmental signaling circuit.
We found that CUL2 FEM1B uses two interface zinc ions to detect FNIP1 during reductive stress. Depletion of zinc or mutation of zinc-binding residues in FEM1B or FNIP1 abrogated substrate recognition and ubiquitylation by CUL2 FEM1B . By contrast, preventing the few side chain interactions, such as those mediated by FNIP1’s KY-finger, only impaired, but did not obliterate, FNIP1 recognition by its E3 ligase. Zinc is therefore essential to deliver FNIP1 to CUL2 FEM1B and works in analogy to molecular glues that are increasingly used in induced protein degradation ( Jevtić et al., 2021 35.

It is interesting to note that the BEX proteins also use zinc for binding to FEM1B. Moreover, the oxidative stress sensor KEAP1 is a Zn 2+ -binding protein ( Dinkova-Kostova et al., 2005 19. Dinkova-Kostova, A.T. ∙ Holtzclaw, W.D. ∙ Wakabayashi, N.

McMahon, M. ∙ Lamont, D.J. ∙ Beattie, K.A. ... Keap1 perceives stress via three sensors for the endogenous signaling molecules nitric oxide, zinc, and alkenals Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :18838-18843 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ), as is HSP33, a chaperone that is activated by oxidative stress ( Ilbert et al., 2007 31. Ilbert, M. ∙ Horst, J. ∙ Ahrens, S. ... The redox-switch domain of Hsp33 functions as dual stress sensor Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14 :556-563 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings highlight a central role of zinc in controlling eukaryotic redox stress signaling. Although the role of zinc in regulating KEAP1 remains to be fully understood, concomitant oxidative and heat stress release zinc from HSP33. This triggers local unfolding of HSP33, which increases its ability to detect unfolded proteins ( Ilbert et al., 2007 31. Ilbert, M. ∙ Horst, J. ∙ Ahrens, S. ... The redox-switch domain of Hsp33 functions as dual stress sensor Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14 :556-563 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). How zinc is loaded onto FEM1B-FNIP1 complexes, and whether its binding or release are regulated in analogy to HSP33 awaits future studies. It is an exciting possibility that zinc fluctuations affect FNIP1 stability and mitochondrial activity, a notion that could explain why excessive zinc stimulates mitochondrial ROS production ( Lee, 2018 43. Lee, S.R. Critical Role of Zinc as Either an Antioxidant or a Prooxidant in Cellular Systems Oxid. Med. Cell. Longev. 2018; 2018 :9156285 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Zinc has been known to stabilize the structure of interaction modules, such as zinc fingers or RING domains ( Klug, 2010 39. Klug, A.

Biochem. 2010; 79 :213-231 Crossref Scopus (551) PubMed Google Scholar ; Plechanovová et al., 2012 62. Plechanovová, A. ∙ Jaffray, E.G. ∙ Tatham, M.H. ...

Interaction of circadian clock proteins CRY1 and PER2 is modulated by zinc binding and disulfide bond formation Cell. 2014; 157 :1203-1215 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). The interfaces involving zinc ions in previous structures were small compared to additional binding surfaces formed by side chains ( Park et al., 2017 59. Park, Y.B. ∙ Hohl, M. ∙ Padjasek, M. ... Eukaryotic Rad50 functions as a rod-shaped dimer Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2017; 24 :248-257 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmalen et al., 2014 69.

Interaction of circadian clock proteins CRY1 and PER2 is modulated by zinc binding and disulfide bond formation Cell. 2014; 157 :1203-1215 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ), and loss of zinc did not abrogate these binding events in vitro . By contrast, zinc is the major determinant of the FEM1B-FNIP1 interaction, and recognition of FNIP1 by FEM1B is obliterated upon zinc depletion or mutation of zinc-binding residues in this E3 ligase or substrate. Rather than a single zinc, the FEM1B-FNIP1 complex also contains two metal ions that endow FEM1B with high affinity toward FNIP1. It will be interesting to see whether other redox-regulated interactions require multiple interface zinc ions, or whether the architecture of the FEM1B-FNIP1 interface is an evolutionary adaptation to requirements of reductive stress signaling.
Although genetic studies revealed FNIP1 as the essential substrate of FEM1B in myoblasts ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), FEM1B also ubiquitylates SLBP and participates in the C-end rule pathway ( Dankert et al., 2017 16. Dankert, J.F. ∙ Pagan, J.K. ∙ Starostina, N.G. ... FEM1 proteins are ancient regulators of SLBP degradation Cell Cycle. 2017; 16 :556-564 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koren et al., 2018 41. Koren, I. ∙ Timms, R.T. ∙ Kula, T. ...

Cell. 2018; 70 :602-613.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). FEM1B recognizes the C-end rule degron through a surface that overlaps with the FNIP1 binding site ( Chen et al., 2021 11. Chen, X. ∙ Liao, S. ∙ Makaros, Y. ... Molecular basis for arginine C-terminal degron recognition by Cul2(FEM1) E3 ligase Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; 17 :254-262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2021 86.

However, detection of the C-end degron by FEM1B neither required C186 nor zinc. Moreover, while the C-end rule degron is recognized with a low affinity of ∼6 μM ( Chen et al., 2021 11. Chen, X. ∙ Liao, S. ∙ Makaros, Y. ... Molecular basis for arginine C-terminal degron recognition by Cul2(FEM1) E3 ligase Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; 17 :254-262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2021 86. Yan, X. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Li, Y. ... Molecular basis for ubiquitin ligase CRL2(FEM1C)-mediated recognition of C-degron Nat. Chem. Biol. 2021; 17 :263-271 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), FEM1B binds FNIP1 with a high affinity of ∼20 nM. This suggests that zinc ions afford FEM1B with high affinity toward FNIP1 and supports genetic studies that identified FNIP1 as the prime CUL2 FEM1B target regulating oxidative phosphorylation.
The overlap in binding sites predicts that accumulation of C-end rule substrates could impact mitochondrial activity by preventing FNIP1 degradation. Conversely, reductive stress might prevent recognition of C-end rule substrates, a notion that is likely given the ∼300-fold higher affinity of FEM1B toward FNIP1. The BEX proteins could also block ubiquitylation of both reductive stress and C-end rule substrates. Consequently, induction of BEX proteins, as it occurs in stem cells ( Navas-Perez et al., 2020 55. Navas-Pérez, E. ∙ Vicente-García, C. ∙ Mirra, S. ... Characterization of an eutherian gene cluster generated after transposon domestication identifies Bex3 as relevant for advanced neurological functions Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :267 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schwarz et al., 2018 70.

Prospective Isolation of Poised iPSC Intermediates Reveals Principles of Cellular Reprogramming Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 23 :289-305.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), might not only impact reductive stress signaling, but also protein homeostasis, thus providing an intricate example of coordination between different proteolytic pathways.
Cells use reductive stress signaling to detect a dangerous drop in ROS and in response activate oxidative phosphorylation ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore tempting to speculate that ROS are second messengers that report on the activity of the electron transport chain, and thus, the rate of ATP synthesis rather than ATP levels. Because cells need to adjust ATP production to nutrient availability, developmental inputs, or cell-cycle stage, ROS levels that trigger FNIP1 degradation should vary dependent on the cellular state.
The FEM1B-FNIP1 structure allowed us to discover how this regulation can be brought about. FNIP1 occupies only half of the conserved substrate-binding pocket in FEM1B, and the disease-linked R126 of FEM1B does not engage this substrate. Accordingly, R126 of FEM1B is not required for FNIP1 ubiquitylation but recruits the BEX proteins that are encoded on Xq22 ( Navas-Pérez et al., 2020 55. Navas-Pérez, E. ∙ Vicente-García, C. ∙ Mirra, S. ... Characterization of an eutherian gene cluster generated after transposon domestication identifies Bex3 as relevant for advanced neurological functions Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :267 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the BEX proteins bind with high affinity to the substrate-binding groove of FEM1B, they are not efficiently ubiquitylated by CUL2 FEM1B . Rather than being CUL2 FEM1B substrates ( Tamai et al., 2020 77. Tamai, K. ∙ Nakamura-Shima, M. ∙ Shibuya-Takahashi, R. ... BEX2 suppresses mitochondrial activity and is required for dormant cancer stem cell maintenance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :21592 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), our analyses suggest that the BEX proteins are pseudosubstrate inhibitors of the reductive stress E3 ligase.
Pseudosubstrate inhibitors can establish tight and dynamic enzyme control ( Miller et al., 2006 51. Miller, J.J. ∙ Summers, M.K. ∙ Hansen, D.V. ... Emi1 stably binds and inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :2410-2420 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ; Newton, 2018 56.

The few pseudosubstrate inhibitors of E3 ligases that have been studied in detail show multivalent binding to the ubiquitylation enzyme and a dearth of Lys residues as potential sites for modification ( Burton et al., 2011 8. Burton, J.L. ∙ Xiong, Y. ∙ Solomon, M.J. Mechanisms of pseudosubstrate inhibition of the anaphase promoting complex by Acm1 EMBO J. 2011; 30 :1818-1829 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; He et al., 2013 27. He, J. ∙ Chao, W.C. ∙ Zhang, Z. ... Insights into degron recognition by APC/C coactivators from the structure of an Acm1-Cdh1 complex Mol. Cell. 2013; 50 :649-660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is, therefore, interesting to note that all BEX proteins possess at most two Lys residues close to their FEM1B-binding CTP. Moreover, our studies suggest that the BEX proteins bind FEM1B in a multivalent manner through sites centered on C186/Zn 2+ and R126. Because BEX1 does not inhibit FEM1B despite containing a functional CTP, other BEX proteins likely contain an additional binding motif for FEM1B to effectively control reductive stress signaling. As shown with EMI1, pseudosubstrate inhibitors can switch from blocking ubiquitylation to being a substrate of the same E3 ligase, allowing for quick activation of ubiquitin transfer ( Cappell et al., 2018 9. Cappell, S.D. ∙ Mark, K.G. ∙ Garbett, D. ... EMI1 switches from being a substrate to an inhibitor of APC/C CDH1 to start the cell cycle Nature. 2018; 558 :313-317 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether BEX proteins can be ubiquitylated by CUL2 FEM1B or whether their regulation depends on different mechanisms are important questions for future work.
Consistent with the role of BEX proteins as inhibitors of CUL2 FEM1B , they are expressed at high levels in stem cells that should not activate much reductive stress signaling ( Navas-Pérez et al., 2020 55. Navas-Pérez, E. ∙ Vicente-García, C. ∙ Mirra, S. ... Characterization of an eutherian gene cluster generated after transposon domestication identifies Bex3 as relevant for advanced neurological functions Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :267 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schwarz et al., 2018 70.

Prospective Isolation of Poised iPSC Intermediates Reveals Principles of Cellular Reprogramming Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 23 :289-305.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). BEX2 also promotes re-programming fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells, a process that relies on inactivation of mitochondrial ATP production ( Schwarz et al., 2018 70. Schwarz, B.A. ∙ Cetinbas, M. ∙ Clement, K. ... Prospective Isolation of Poised iPSC Intermediates Reveals Principles of Cellular Reprogramming Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 23 :289-305.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, BEX mRNA levels decrease during differentiation ( Navas-Pérez et al., 2020 55. Navas-Pérez, E. ∙ Vicente-García, C. ∙ Mirra, S. ... Characterization of an eutherian gene cluster generated after transposon domestication identifies Bex3 as relevant for advanced neurological functions Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :267 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), which should allow cells to activate oxidative phosphorylation in response to small drops in ROS. BEX proteins are overexpressed in lung and renal cancer, two tumor types that are caused by mutations in KEAP1 or NFE2L2 that would otherwise elicit persistent FNIP1 degradation ( Uhlen et al., 2017 79. Uhlen, M. ∙ Zhang, C. ∙ Lee, S. ... A pathology atlas of the human cancer transcriptome Science. 2017; 357 :eaan2507 Crossref Scopus (2244) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculate that BEX overexpression restricts oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells that use glycolysis for ATP production ( Warburg et al., 1927 82. Warburg, O. ∙ Wind, F. ∙ Negelein, E. The Metabolism of Tumors in the Body J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3068) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most importantly, deletion of BEX genes leads to a global developmental delay and intellectual disability that is similar to the phenotypes observed in patients in R126 mutations in FEM1B ( Hijazi et al., 2020 28. Hijazi, H. ∙ Coelho, F.S. ∙ Gonzaga-Jauregui, C. ... Xq22 deletions and correlation with distinct neurological disease traits in females: Further evidence for a contiguous gene syndrome Hum. Mutat. 2020; 41 :150-168 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lecoquierre et al., 2019 42. Lecoquierre, F. ∙ Duffourd, Y. ∙ Vitobello, A. ..., Orphanomix Physician’s Group Variant recurrence in neurodevelopmental disorders: the use of publicly available genomic data identifies clinically relevant pathogenic missense variants Genet. Med. 2019; 21 :2504-2511 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on these observations, we conclude that regulation of reductive stress signaling by the opposite activities of BEX proteins and CUL2 FEM1B is critical for organismal development. We anticipate that modulating this regulatory circuit will provide opportunities to exploit mitochondrial regulation as a therapeutic approach against cancer as well as diseases of aberrant tissue homeostasis.
This study provides insight into the redox-dependent recognition of the FNIP1 degron by FEM1B and regulation of this event by BEX proteins. It is possible that FEM1B detects additional domains of FNIP1 or of its constitutive binding partner FLCN, which might further fine-tune reductive stress signaling.

Optimized E. coli expression strain LOBSTR eliminates common contaminants from His-tag purification Proteins. 2013; 81 :1857-1861 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 37°C until reaching an OD 600 of 0.6 and then induced overnight with 0.2 mM isopropyl β- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (ßME), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were lysed by adding egg white lysozyme (1 mg/mL final concentration) and sonication. After centrifugation for 30 mins at 36,000 xg, clarified lysate was bound to glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), washed (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, and 5 mM ßME), and eluted with glutathione (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM ßME, 10 mM reduced glutathione, 0.1% Triton X-100). The eluate was then bound to amylose resin (NEB), washed (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, and 1 mM TCEP), and bound complex was eluted using TEV protease (UC Berkeley Macrolab) over two days at 4°C. Free GST protein was removed by passing the eluate over glutathione resin. Glycerol was added (20% final concentration) and the protein was concentrated and injected onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, and 1 mM TCEP. Purified FEM1B-FNIP1 complex was concentrated to 20 mg/mL, aliquoted, and flash-frozen for crystallography.
Crystals were grown using the hanging vapor-diffusion method in 24-well plates. FEM1B-FNIP1 complex (20 mg/mL) was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the reservoir solution containing 6% isopropanol, 150 mM NaCl, and 100 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5. Crystals with a tetragonal trapezohedron shape appeared within 3 days. Crystals were cryo-protected by soaking them in a solution containing the reservoir solution plus 20% (v/v) glycerol and they were then plunged into liquid nitrogen.
Data were collected on the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 14-1 at 100 K. Additionally, X-ray fluorescence spectra were obtained by excitation at the Se-K edge (12658 eV). Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table S1 .

The unit cell was the space group I422 with dimensions 164.42, 164.42, and 465.21 Å. The structure was solved by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method using two combined 360° datasets collected at the Zn 2+ anomalous peak wavelength (1.28227 Å).

Crystallography analysis software was curated by SBGrid ( Morin et al., 2013 52. Morin, A. ∙ Eisenbraun, B. ∙ Key, J. ... Collaboration gets the most out of software eLife. 2013; 2 :e01456 Crossref Scopus (682) PubMed Google Scholar ). UCSF Chimera (ver. 1.15) ( Pettersen et al., 2004 60.

Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33445) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for structural analysis and generating figures. Structural alignments were performed with the Matchmaker function. For FEM1B conservation, homologs of mouse FEM1B were obtained by searching diverse phyla using NCBI blastp with the default search parameters. Homologs were considered if they were the top hit for a particular species and contained > 30% sequence identity. Conservation was plotted onto the surface of FEM1B based on an alignment of 12 metazoan FEM1B homologs according to a red-white-blue color scheme. X-ray fluorescence data were plotted in R (ver. 4.0.2). Chemical stick diagrams were generated in Chemdraw (ver. 19.1).
Full length MBP-FEM1B mutants and HIS-SUMO-BEX2 were purified as previously described ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mouse MBP-HIS-FEM1B (pMAL, New England Biolabs), MBP-HIS-FEM1B/Elongin B/Elongin C 17-112 complex (pRSFduet-1, Sigma-Aldrich, 71341), and HIS-SUMO-TEV-BEX2 (pET28A) were expressed in E.coli LOBSTR cells grown to OD 600 of 0.5 and then induced overnight with 0.33 mM isopropyl β- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16°C. Cells were resuspened in lysis buffer A (50mM HEPES 7.5, 50mM NaCL, 1mM PMSF, 1mM EDTA, 5mg/ml Lysozyme) and rocked at 15 minutes at room temperature. Cell suspensions were added to ½ the volume of buffer B (50mM HEPES 7.5, 300mM NaCl 1.5mM PMSF, 15mM β-mercaptoethanol 30mM Imidazole) and cooled to 4°C. Cells were lysed by sonication and lysates cleared by centrifuging for 30,000 g for 1h. The supernatant was added to washed Ni-NTA beads for 1-2 hours. Ni-NTA were washed three times for 15min with rocking in wash buffer (50mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20mM imidazole, and 1mM PMSF). Bound proteins were eluted with 50mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol, 250mM imidazole. Elutions were dialyzed overnight in 50mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol and the next day run on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200pg (For FEM1B proteins) and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75pg (For BEX2). Protein fractions were collected, concentrated, and flash frozen. For the Tris versus HEPES fluorescence polarization assay, aliquots of HEPES purified MBP-FEM1B was desalted into either Tris (50mM Tris pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol) or HEPES (50mM HEPES pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing buffers using PD midiTrap G-25 desalting columns (Cytiva, 28918008).
For CUL2 FEM1B complex purification HIS-CUL2/RBX1 was generated from insect cells using pFastBac Dual vector. Baculovirus packaging and amplification were performed as described (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System, Thermo Fisher). 3L of SF9 cells were infected and collected after 72 hours. Cells were lysed in 50mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl 1mM PMSF, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10mM Imidazole, and 0.5% NP40 with gentle rocking at 4°C for 1h and purified as described above for MBP-HIS-FEM1B. To form CUL2-FEM1B complexes, elutions of HIS-CUL2/RBX1 and MBP-HIS-FEM1B/Elongin B/Elongin C 17-112 first purified as above with Ni-NTA, were mixed and added to equal volumes of 50mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol. The mixture was rocked for 2 hours at 4°C and afterward 1μg/50μg TEV to protein was added to cleave the MBP and HIS tags off of FEM1B and CUL2 respectively. The TEV cleavage was performed while dialyzing overnight in 50mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. The next day complexes were separated on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200pg. Complex fractions were collected, concentrated, aliquoted, and flash frozen. E1/UBA1 and UBE2R1 were purified previously described ( Jin et al., 2012 36. Jin, L. ∙ Pahuja, K.B. ∙ Wickliffe, K.E. ...

The neddylation machinery (human UBA3 (E1), UBE2M (E2), NEDD8) and ubiquitin were purchased from Boston Biochem (E-313, E2-656, UL-812, U-100H).
All fluorescence polarization assays were performed using a Perkin Elmer 2104 Envision plate reader. All FP data was calculated from the average of two technical duplicate mP values (1000 ∗ (S-G ∗ P)/(S+G ∗ P), S = 595 s channel 2 and p = 595p channel 1, G = 1.1) subtracted from peptide only wells and normalized to control. The assays were performed by mixing 12.5 μL of MBP-FEM1B construct at indicated concentrations and treatments (BEX2 additions were added to the MBP-FEM1B mix), with 12.5 μL of a peptide mix at a final concentration of 5-10nM with indicated treatments (all metal ion additions and chelator treatments were added to the peptide stock). Reactions with 0.5nM, 1nM, or 2nM peptide controlled against potential receptor depletion. All assays were done in binding buffer (40mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, and 100 μM TCEP) with 0.2% NP40 for FNIP1 peptides and 0.01% NP40 for the BEX3 peptide. For Figures S3 D and 6 G, FEM1B concentration was fixed at 100nM and all metal ions added to S3D were at 10μM final. For TPEN titration in Figure 1 C, FEM1B concentration was fixed 125nM and peptide concentration at 50nM. For the Tris versus HEPES assay, Tris 7.5 was used in place of HEPES for all dilutions for indicated samples. TAMRA-labeled FNIP1 peptides (5,6-TAMRA-RNKSSLLFKESEETRTPNCNCKYCSHPVLG) and mutants were purchased from the Koch Institute/MIT Biopolymers lab. The BEX3 TAMRA-labeled peptide (5,6-TAMRA-RELQLRNCLRILMGELSNHHDHHDEFCLMP) was purchased from Biomatik. All graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc) using the specific binding fit with Hill slope equation. Accounting for protein depletion was not sufficient for fitting the data and fitting with a Hill coefficient improved the fit. For TPEN or BEX2 titrations, inhibitor concentration versus normalized response with variable slope was used. Apparent K D and apparent Hill slope are shown in Table S2 .
CUL2-ELONGIN B/C-RBX1-FEM1B WT or R126A complexes were neddylated in 20μl reactions with 5μM ligase complex, 6.3μM Nedd8, 500nM UBA3 (E1) and 400nM Ube2m (E2), 20mM ATP, 1mM DTT in UBA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 10mM MgCl 2 ) at 30°C for 15min with gently shaking. For the ubiquitylation reactions Nedd8 modified CUL2 FEM1B ligases (2μM final) were first incubated with HIS-SUMO-BEX2 (4μM final) or buffer for 5min with gently shaking at 30°C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ubiquitylation mix consisting of 500nM TAMRA-Fnip1 562-591 , 100μM ubiquitin, 20mM ATP, 0.1mM DTT, 1μM E1, 2μM UBE2R1 in UBA buffer (final volume 10μl). Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 1 hour and stopped with 20μl 2x urea sample buffer (150mM Tris 6.5, 6M urea, 6% SDS, 25% glycerol and bromophenol blue). Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with fluorescence detection using a Protein Simple FluorChem system and immunoblot for indicated proteins. Inputs represent 100% of protein in reaction.
Binding experiments were done at room temperature in 300μl of buffer (20mM Tris 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.2% NP40 substitute, 100μM of TCEP, and 100 μM 1,10-Phenanthroline where indicated) with 500nM final concentration of MBP-HIS FEM1B or MBP EPS8 and HIS-SUMO BEX2. Binding reactions were mixed for 30 minute and then added to 20μl of Amylose bead slurry and left to bind for an addition 30 minutes. Beads were washed 4x in 1ml binding buffer and proteins eluted in 2x urea sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All inputs are of total protein.
For co-immunoprecipitation. 1.5 million HEK293T cells were seeded into 10cm dishes and the next day were transfected with indicated constructs. 36-40 hours’ post transfection cells were harvested in phospho buffered saline (PBS) by scraping, spun down, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 500μl of lysis buffer (40mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.2% NP40 substitute, and cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Sigma Aldrich, 11873580001)). For endogenous 3xFLAG-FEM1B co-immunoprecipitations, 2 15 cm plates of either HEK293Ts or 3xFLAG-FEM1B C9 HEK293Ts were harvested for each IP and lysed in 1200μl of lysis buffer. Lysates were gently nutated for 30 minutes at 4°C. Cell lysates were cleared with a 21,000 g spin at 4°C for 30 minutes and samples normalized to protein concentration and volume using either Pierce 660nm Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher, 22660) or Abs280. Lysates were added to 20μl of prewashed ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Agarose Gel slurry (Sigma-Aldrich, A2220). Beads were rocked at 4°C for 90min, spun down and washed 3x in lysis buffer without protease inhibitor. All liquid was removed before the first and last washed with a compressed gel loading tip, and proteins were eluted in urea sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by immunoblot with indicated antibodies. All inputs represent 5% of the loaded immunoprecipitated sample. For TPEN treatment, 3.5μM TPEN (Sigma-Aldrich, P4413) was added for 16 hours before harvesting the cells.
C2C12s were trypsinized and spun at 90 x g. 50k cells were resuspended in 20 μL buffer SE (Lonza V4XC-1032). Corresponding plasmid DNA constructs (1 μg) and corresponding siRNA (20 nM final in 1ml) were added to cells suspensions and gently transferred to a nucleofection strip. The samples were pulsed with program CD-137 (Lonza 4D-Nucleofector). After pulsing, cells suspensions were allowed to recover for 10 minutes and subsequently resuspended in 80 μL of pre-warmed Opti-MEM. Cell suspensions were equally divided into two wells of a 12-well plate containing borosilicate coverslips and pre-warmed growth media. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15min, permeabilized with 0.1% triton, and stained for NRF2 in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 3 hours. Coverslips were washed and incubated for 1 hour for secondary antibody and Hoechst (AnaSpec, 83218), washed again, and mounted onto slides. Imaging was performed on an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-1X confocal scanner unit (CSUX1 Borealis Square Upgrade Module), an Andor iXon3 camera (IXON DU-897-BV), and an Andor Technology Laser Combiner System 500 series equipped with four laser lines. Images were analyzed using Metamorph Advanced (Molecular Devices) and Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 68. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). NRF2 nuclear localization ratio was measured by creating a mask for the nuclei channel (Hoechst) and for the cytoplasm 1 μm around the nuclei mask, the NRF2 signal from these masks was measured.
The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-FLAG (Clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich, F1804), anti-CUL2 (Bethyl, A302-476A), anti-FNIP1 (Abcam, ab134969), anti-beta-ACTIN (MP Biomedicals, clone C4, 691001), α-TOMM20 (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA011562), BEX2 Antibody (C-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-398486) anti-HA-Tag (C29F4, Cell Signaling Technology (CST), 3724), anti-FLAG DYKDDDDK Tag (CST, 2368), and anti-NRF2 (D1Z9C, CST, 12721). For the endogenous 3xFLAG-FEM1B immunoprecipitation, as BEX2 runs close to the antibody light chain, we used Peroxidase AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG, Fcγ fragment specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 115-035-008)
To analyze the proliferation of cells expressing variants of FEM1B, HEK293Ts were infected with pLVX- 3xFLAG FEM1B-IRES-PURO constructs and selected for 2 days in 1μg/ml puromycin. Cells were counted and plated in 6 well plates at 150,000 cells/well. Cells were grown in the presence of 1μg/ml puromycin for the duration of the experiment. At day 3 and day 5 cells were counted using Corning Cytosmart cell counter.
For whole cell lysates, cells were seeded into 6 well plates and media changed 12 hours prior to harvesting. Cells were washed in cold PBS and incubated in the plate with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10mM β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mM EDTA, 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 with Roche cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) with rocking for 10min at 4°C. Cells were scraped and transferred to tubes and rocked addition 20min at 4°C. Lysates were spun at 21,000 gs for 10min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected, normalized with Pierce 660nm, and added to an equal volume of 2x urea sample buffer. Samples were heated to 65°C for 10min and analyzed by immunoblot with indicated antibodies.
All FEM1B mutants were generated using the quick-change method and validated by sequencing. Mouse FNIP1 562-591 and FEM1B 1-377 were cloned into pETDuet1 for coexpression and purification. FNIP1 Degron mutants and CDK5R1 C-terminal degron were inserted into the pCS2+ GFP-IRES-mCherry reporter ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ) by designing oligos of the degron sequences (FNIP1 562-591 , CDK5R1 283-307 ) with indicated mutations and with the forward oligo including a 5′ CAGC and a reverse oligo a 5′ ATCA. Degron oligos were phosphorylated, annealed and ligated into the reporter construct containing the complementary overhands produced by cutting with Esp3I (New England BioLabs, R0734). All BEX genes were cloned from HEK293T cDNA and cloned into pCS2+ with N-terminal HA tags and BEX2 was also cloned into pET28A-HIS-SUMO-TEV.
293T cells were split into 12 wells at 75,000 cells per well. The next day cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs and grown for an additional 48 hours. For pLVX- 3xFLAG FEM1B-IRES-PURO ROS measurements, selected cells were seeded 75,000 and 150,000 (For R126Q) into 12 wells. Cells were grown for 48 hours and had their media replaced. The following day ROS levels were measured. H2O2 was measured from growth media using the ROS-Glo H2O2 Assay (Promega, G8820) according the manufactures protocol. Luminescence was measured with a Perkin-Elmer Envision Multilabel Plate Reader and normalized to cell count.
HEK293T cells were infected with indicated pLVX-FEM1B-IRES-PURO viruses and selected for 1 day in puromycin as described in transfections and lentiviral packaging section. Cells were counted and plated into two 96 well black clear bottom plates at 100,000 cells per well (R126Q was seeded 20% higher to compensate for proliferation defect) in 200μl of DMEM 10% Fetal Bovine Serum. The next day the media was changed 3x with a final volume 90μl, the cells were incubated for 10min at 37°C and 10 μL of prewarmed MitoXpress Xtra reagent (MX-200-4, Agilent) was added to each well. Mineral oil was quickly applied to all analysis wells and samples were measured over time using Perkin Elmer 2104 Envision plate reader at 37°C using time-resolved fluorescence measurement. 6 wells for each condition were analyzed (occasional wells with negative slopes were omitted) per experiment and the average rate (RFU/hour) was normalized to cell count of three wells for each condition from the second 96 well plate (treated in a similar manner with 3 PBS washes).
For FEM1B mutant mass spectrometry experiments 10 15cm plates were seeded with 3.5 million HEK293T cells and 24 hours later transfected with indicated FEM1B mutants. 36-40 hours post transfection cells were harvested by scraping in PBS, washed 1x, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For endogenous 3xFLAG-FEM1B mass spectrometry experiment, 25 15 cm plates of 3xFLAG-FEM1B HEK293T C9 ( Manford et al., 2020 48. Manford, A.G. ∙ Rodríguez-Pérez, F. ∙ Shih, K.Y. ... A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress Cell. 2020; 183 :46-61.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ) cells were harvested as above. Cells were lysed in 5x wt/vol lysis buffer (40mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.2% NP40 substitute, and cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Sigma Aldrich, 11873580001) and nutated at 4°C for 60min. Lysates were spun at 21,000 g for 30min and the supernatant was added to 100μl of prewashed ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Agarose Gel slurry (Sigma-Aldrich, A2220). After 1-1.5 hours of nutating, the beads were spun down and transferred to a 1.7ml tubes. Beads were washed 5x with 1.4ml lysis buffer without protease inhibitors, with all the liquid being removed with a compressed gel loading tip after the first and last wash. Beads were then washed 2x in PBS with 0.2% NP40 substitute and all of the last PBS removed with a compressed gel loading tip. Proteins were eluted with 2 times with 250μl of 500μg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (Millipore Cat#F4799) in PBS with 0.2% NP40. Elutions were pooled and precipitated in 20% final concentration of trichloroacetic acid on ice overnight. Precipitations were spun at 21,000 gs for 10min and washed 3x in ice cold acetone and dried. The pellets were solubilized 8M urea 100mM Tris pH 8.5, treated with TCEP and iodoacetamide, and digested for 16-20 hours with trypsin (V5111, Promega). Samples were analyzed by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) at the Vincent J. Coates Proteomics/Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at UC Berkeley. Results were analyzed by CompPASS analysis ( Huttlin et al., 2017 30. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Bruckner, R.J. ∙ Paulo, J.A. ... Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks Nature. 2017; 545 :505-509 Crossref Scopus (987) PubMed Google Scholar ) comparing the samples to over 70 similarly performed anti-FLAG IPs from 293T cells. The data represents the average of 2-3 biological replicates each with 1-2 technical replicates per biological replicate. Results were normalized to 4000 bait counts with a z-score cutoff of the top 90% of unique proteins with total spectral count greater than 2. Previously published and validated interactors were also included that did not meet the Z-score cutoff. For the endogenous FEM1B mass spectrometry experiment, results were normalized to 1000 bait total spectral counts and only validated interactors are presented. Relatively stoichiometry is the ratio of total spectral counts and the number of amino acids in each protein normalized to bait = 1.
HEK293T cells were seeded at 300k cells per well of a 6-well plate. The next day cells were transfected with indicated reporter and any additional plasmids. 24 hour post-transfection cells were trypsinized, spun down at 300 g for 5min, and resuspended in DMEM 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were analyzed on either a BD Bioscience LSR Fortessa or LSR Fortessa X20at the University of California Berkeley flow cytometer facility, and FlowJo. GFP/mCherry ratios were determined from the median GFP and mCherry values. For TPEN and Pomalidomide treatment, TPEN was added at 2.5μM for 16hours and 10μM Pomalidomide (MedChemExpress, HY-10984) for 4 hours.
All siRNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher, 13778150) using 20nM final concentration of indicated siRNA according to the manufactures protocol. When transfecting multiple siRNAs, the total siRNA amount was kept constant using control siRNA. All plasmid transfections were performed with polyethyleneimine (PEI, Polysciences 23966-1). For FEM1B mutant co-immunoprecipitation transfections, 1μg of pCS2 + 3xFLAG FEM1B construct and 1μg of pCS2+ were transfected in 300μl Opti-MEM with 12μl of PEI (1mg/ml). For FEM1B-BEX co-immunoprecipitation transfections, 0.5-1μg of indicated pCS2-3xFLAG-FEM1B and 2-3.5μg pCS2-HA-BEX constructs were transfected with 1:6 ratio of DNA to PEI. For FEM1B mutant mass spectrometry experiments a master mix was made where each 15cm plate was transfected with equivalent of 300μl Opti-MEM, 2μg of indicated FEM1B construct, and 12μl PEI. For FEM1B mutant FNIP1 degron flow experiments, 1μg of FEM1B construct, 0.1μg of indicated pCS2-GFP-FNIP1 562-591 -IRES-mCherry construct, and 0.9μg of pCS2+ were transfected in 300μl Opti-MEM with 12μl PEI. 65μl of this reaction was used to transfect one well of a 6-well plate. For FEM1B degron flow assays comparing FEM1B and R126 mutants or BEX overexpression, 0.075μg of FEM1B construct, 0.1μg of pCS2-GFP-FNIP1 562-591 -IRES-mCherry reporter or pCS2-GFP-CDK5R1 283-307 -IRES-mCherry, and 1.825μg of pCS2+ or indicated BEX plasmid was transfected as above.
All lentiviral constructs were generated using Stbl3 E. Coli (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C737303). 3xFLAG-FEM1B and indicated mutants were cloned into pLVX-EF1alpha-IRES-PURO (Lenti-X Expression System Takara Bio, 631253). Lentiviral pLKO.1 constructs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (shBEX3, TRCN0000303798). Lentiviruses were produced in HEK293T cells by co-transfection with lentiviral constructs with packaging plasmids (pMD2.5G Addgene, 12259; psPAX2 Addgene, 12260) using PEI. The media was collected and filtered through a 0.45μm filter and concentrated with Lenti-X concentrator following the manufactures protocol (Takara, 631232). Precipitated virus pellets were resuspended in Opti-MEM, aliquoted, and frozen. For shRNA, unattached HEK293T cells were infected with indicted viruses right after passaging the cells in the presence of 8μg/μl polybrene. For pLVX- 3xFLAG FEM1B-IRES-PURO infections, 200,000 HEK293T cells were put in 12 well plates with lentivirus and 8μg/ml polybrene. Cells were spun for 1 hour at 1000 gs at 30°C, returned to the incubator, and split into 6 well plates the next day. Infected cells were selected with 1μg/ml puromycin 24 hours after shRNA infection or 48 hours after pLVX- 3xFLAG FEM1B-IRES-PURO infection.
Inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy was performed on a Perkin Elmer 5300 DV with purified proteins (0.02-0.06 mg/mL) diluted in 2% HNO 3 . Standard curves (0, 0.1, and 1 μg/mL) were prepared for several transition metals (Sigma, 04330-100ML), samples were measured in triplicate, and metal concentrations were determined using a linear fit from the standard curves.
All quantifications are presented as the means ± standard deviation (SD). Significance was determined by 2 tailed t test, ns p > 0.05, ∗ p ≤ 0.05; ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.0001.
