Title: Single-Cell Analyses Inform Mechanisms of Myeloid-Targeted Therapies in Colon Cancer


Abstract: Summary

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for defining cellular diversity in tumors, but its application toward dissecting mechanisms underlying immune-modulating therapies is scarce. We performed scRNA-seq analyses on immune and stromal populations from colorectal cancer patients, identifying specific macrophage and conventional dendritic cell (cDC) subsets as key mediators of cellular cross-talk in the tumor microenvironment. Defining comparable myeloid populations in mouse tumors enabled characterization of their response to myeloid-targeted immunotherapy. Treatment with anti-CSF1R preferentially depleted macrophages with an inflammatory signature but spared macrophage populations that in mouse and human expresses pro-angiogenic/tumorigenic genes. Treatment with a CD40 agonist antibody preferentially activated a cDC population and increased Bhlhe40 + Th1-like cells and CD8 + memory T cells. Our comprehensive analysis of key myeloid subsets in human and mouse identifies critical cellular interactions regulating tumor immunity and defines mechanisms underlying myeloid-targeted immunotherapies currently undergoing clinical testing.

Section: Introduction

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is capable of disrupting immune surveillance subversion by cancer cells and has dramatically altered cancer treatment paradigms ( Ribas and Wolchok, 2018 56. Ribas, A. ∙ Wolchok, J.D. Cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade Science. 2018; 359 :1350-1355 Crossref Scopus (4223) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, as ICB has shown activity in only a minority of patients with specific cancers ( Ribas and Wolchok, 2018; Yarchoan et al., 2017 56. Ribas, A. ∙ Wolchok, J.D. Cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade Science. 2018; 359 :1350-1355 Crossref Scopus (4223) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Yarchoan, M. ∙ Hopkins, A. ∙ Jaffee, E.M.

Med. 2017; 377 :2500-2501 Crossref Scopus (2298) PubMed Google Scholar ), additional therapeutic strategies to potentiate anti-tumor immunity have been proposed, including depletion of pro-tumorigenic or immune suppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and activation of specific immune populations using agonistic antibodies ( Mahoney et al., 2015 45. Mahoney, K.M. ∙ Rennert, P.D. ∙ Freeman, G.J. Combination cancer immunotherapy and new immunomodulatory targets Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015; 14 :561-584 Crossref Scopus (1037) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unfortunately, our incomplete understanding of the complexity of the TME has led to many of these strategies being indiscriminately advanced to the clinic rather than being selected based on clear mechanistic hypotheses ( Binnewies et al., 2018; Galon and Bruni, 2019; Junttila and de Sauvage, 2013 4.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for dissecting the complexity of solid tumors, enabling characterization of cell diversity and heterogeneous phenotypic states in unprecedented detail ( Papalexi and Satija, 2018; Zhang and Zhang, 2019 51.

Res. 2019; 7 :1040-1046 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). scRNA-seq based transcriptome analyses in primary human tumors have not only revealed T cell heterogeneity, but have also begun to elucidate dynamic relationships between T cell populations through integrating analysis of transcriptomes and T cell receptors ( Guo et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Savas et al., 2018; Tirosh et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2017 25.

Previously, we identified a BHLHE40 + Th1-like cell population that is significantly enriched in tumor samples from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI), but not microsatellite stability (MSS) ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that only MSI patients respond to ICB ( Ganesh et al., 2019; Le et al., 2015 22. Ganesh, K. ∙ Stadler, Z.K. ∙ Cercek, A. ... Immunotherapy in colorectal cancer: rationale, challenges and potential Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2019; 16 :361-375 Crossref Scopus (1051) PubMed Google Scholar 39.

Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (7346) PubMed Google Scholar ), these findings suggest that strategies to enhance the presence and function of these T cells may promote response to ICB.
Recently, single-cell analyses have also revealed the complexity of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs), in multiple different cancer types ( Azizi et al., 2018; Chevrier et al., 2017; Lavin et al., 2017; Venteicher et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019; Zilionis et al., 2019 3.

TAMs are a heterogeneous cell type that can contribute to malignancy through production of tumor and angiogenic growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and immunosuppression ( DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019 17. DeNardo, D.G. ∙ Ruffell, B. Macrophages as regulators of tumour immunity and immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :369-382 Crossref Scopus (1397) PubMed Google Scholar ). While immunotherapies aimed at repressing TAM biology have advanced to the clinic, including disruption of macrophage expansion and differentiation by blocking interactions between CSF1R and its ligands CSF1 and IL-34 ( Butowski et al., 2016; Cassier et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020; Papadopoulos et al., 2017; Ries et al., 2014 11.

Tumor-associated DCs constitute only a minority of myeloid cells in the tumor but are key orchestrators of anti-tumor T cell responses ( Merad et al., 2013 47. Merad, M. ∙ Sathe, P. ∙ Helft, J. ... The dendritic cell lineage: ontogeny and function of dendritic cells and their subsets in the steady state and the inflamed setting Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31 :563-604 Crossref Scopus (1742) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conventional DCs (cDCs) can be broadly separated into two subsets (cDC1 and cDC2) based on distinct phenotypic markers and functional roles ( Haniffa et al., 2013 27. Haniffa, M. ∙ Collin, M. ∙ Ginhoux, F. Ontogeny and functional specialization of dendritic cells in human and mouse Adv. Immunol. 2013; 120 :1-49 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the role of cDC2s in the tumor remains poorly defined, cDC1s are critical for the generation of anti-tumor T cell responses based on their ability to cross-present tumor-associated antigens to CD8 + T cells ( Böttcher and Reis E Sousa, 2018; Hildner et al., 2008 7. Böttcher, J.P. ∙ Reis E Sousa, C. The Role of Type 1 Conventional Dendritic Cells in Cancer Immunity Trends Cancer. 2018; 4 :784-792 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Hildner, K. ∙ Edelson, B.T. ∙ Purtha, W.E. ... Batf3 deficiency reveals a critical role for CD8alpha+ dendritic cells in cytotoxic T cell immunity Science. 2008; 322 :1097-1100 Crossref Scopus (1547) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple strategies to boost the function of DCs have advanced to the clinic, with approaches to activate the CD40 receptor being widely explored. However, similar to CSF1R inhibitors, CD40 agonists have shown limited monotherapy efficacy ( Vonderheide, 2020 66. Vonderheide, R.H. CD40 Agonist Antibodies in Cancer Immunotherapy Annu. Rev. Med. 2020; 71 :47-58 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our ability to develop these and other myeloid-targeted therapies is dependent on a comprehensive understanding of myeloid cell heterogeneity in solid tumors and the impact of these therapies on immune cell function and cross-talk within the TME.
While recent studies have attempted to relate the myeloid heterogeneity identified by scRNA-seq in human cancers to cell types found in murine tumor models ( Binnewies et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2019; Gubin et al., 2018; Zilionis et al., 2019 5.

Here, we have utilized two scRNA-seq platforms to perform a high-resolution analysis of immune and stromal cell populations in tumors, adjacent normal tissues, and blood from CRC patients. We further constructed a cell-cell interaction network to define key cell populations involved in regulating tumorigenesis and anti-tumor immunity and identified specific populations of TAMs and DCs as central nodes of cellular interaction. To understand the consequences of modulating the function of these cells, we performed additional scRNA-seq to identify analogous immune cell subsets in pre-clinical mouse tumor models in the context of anti-CSF1R and anti-CD40 antibody treatment. By analyzing both human and mouse scRNA-seq data, we reveal the heterogeneity and function of these cells, their role in shaping the TME, and the translatability of myeloid-modulating therapies from pre-clinical models to human cancer.

Section: Results

We first collected CD45 + and CD45 − cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from tumors, adjacent normal tissues, and blood of 18 treatment-naive CRC patients ( Table S1 ). The transcriptomes of individual cells were obtained by scRNA-seq via either a droplet-based 10× Genomics platform or a plate-based full-length Smart-seq2 platform ( Figure S1 A). The data were combined with the full-length transcriptomes of T cells from the same patients we studied previously ( Figure S1 A) ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). After quality control and filtering, we obtained 43,817 (10× scRNA-seq) and 10,468 (Smart-seq2) transcriptomes of single cells ( STAR Methods ). As expected, the Smart-seq2 platform captured more genes, including cytokines, CD molecules, ligands/receptors and transcription factors, and exhibited weak batch effects compared to the 10× scRNA-seq platform ( Figures S1 B–S1F).
To define the major population and subpopulation structure of the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, we performed graph-based clustering ( Butler et al., 2018 10. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6227) PubMed Google Scholar ) on these two datasets separately, identifying the majority of known immune cell types, including myeloid cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), T cells and B cells ( Figure S2 A). Further unsupervised clustering in each compartment gave rise to a total of 38 and 36 leukocyte cell clusters from the 10× and the Smart-seq2 platform, respectively ( Figures 1 A and S2 B-S2D). We then performed logistic regression modeling ( Young et al., 2018 73. Young, M.D. ∙ Mitchell, T.J. ∙ Vieira Braga, F.A. ... Single-cell transcriptomes from human kidneys reveal the cellular identity of renal tumors Science. 2018; 361 :594-599 Crossref Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ) to define the similarities and relationships between clusters from these two datasets ( Figure S2 E). The leukocyte cell clusters exhibiting high similarities were annotated as the same cell subsets, and the remaining were manually annotated by their specific gene signatures. For lymphocytes, tumor-enriched plasma B cells, gut-associated lymphoid tissue B cells, follicular B cells and germinal center B cells were highly similar between two platforms and could be distinguished by distinct immunoglobulin heavy chain signatures ( Figure S2 F). Likewise, both platforms captured ILCs, including blood- and tissue-enriched natural killer (NK) cells and normal mucosa-enriched ILC3 cells ( Figures S2 B and S2C) ( Klose and Artis, 2016 33. Klose, C.S. ∙ Artis, D. Innate lymphoid cells as regulators of immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :765-774 Crossref Scopus (736) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as tumor-enriched tissue-resident NK cells (hI03) whose expression of inhibitory receptors, cytotoxic molecules, and proliferation-related genes resembled those of CD8 + exhausted T cells described previously in CRC ( Figure S2 G) ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to lymphocytes, myeloid cells exhibited a greater degree of divergence between these two platforms. Specifically, two intermediate state monocyte subsets (hM07 and hM11) were mainly captured by the 10× platform ( Figure 1 B), indicating that a larger number of sequenced cells per patient may be needed to identify rare or transitioning cell populations. Ultimately, we obtained 13 myeloid cell clusters, 4 ILC clusters, 18 T cell clusters, and 5 B cell clusters from these two platforms, largely consistent with previous scRNA-seq studies from different cancer types ( Azizi et al., 2018; Lambrechts et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019 3.

Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell. 2019; 179 :829-845.e820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (836) PubMed Google Scholar ). All cell clusters identified from the two datasets could be visualized by a combined t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis ( Figures 1 C and S3 A). Each cluster was comprised of cells derived from multiple different patients and was associated with a different tissue distribution pattern ( Figures S3 B and S3C).
For non-immune cells from the Smart-seq2 platform, graph-based clustering gave rise to 12 cell clusters ( Figure S3 D). Malignant cells, defined by inferred copy number variations, exhibited a high degree of heterogeneity in gene expression, thus forming patient-specific clusters ( Figures S3 E and S3F, STAR Methods ). Consistent with previous studies in CRC ( Dalerba et al., 2011; Li et al., 2017 16. Dalerba, P. ∙ Kalisky, T. ∙ Sahoo, D. ... Single-cell dissection of transcriptional heterogeneity in human colon tumors Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :1120-1127 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Li, H. ∙ Courtois, E.T. ∙ Sengupta, D. ... Reference component analysis of single-cell transcriptomes elucidates cellular heterogeneity in human colorectal tumors Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :708-718 Crossref Scopus (754) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified several non-malignant cell clusters in normal mucosa and tumors, including vascular endothelial cells, four groups of epithelial cells (enterocytes, stem-like cells and two groups of goblet cells separated by top- and bottom-crypt gene signatures) ( Dalerba et al., 2011; Sasaki et al., 2016 16. Dalerba, P. ∙ Kalisky, T. ∙ Sahoo, D. ... Single-cell dissection of transcriptional heterogeneity in human colon tumors Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :1120-1127 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Sasaki, N. ∙ Sachs, N. ∙ Wiebrands, K. ... Reg4+ deep crypt secretory cells function as epithelial niche for Lgr5+ stem cells in colon Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E5399-E5407 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ), and two groups of fibroblasts. Of note, both myofibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were preferentially found in CRC tumors compared to the normal mucosa ( Figures S3 G and S3H).
Taken together, while the Smart-seq2 platform captured a greater number of genes allowing a more in-depth analysis of regulatory pathways ( Figure S1 ), the 10× platform effectively obtained more clusters ( Figure 1 B). Gene depth of Smart-seq2 and cell coverage of 10× scRNA-seq collectively maximized the number of cell types or rare populations and improved the outcome of cell clustering. Thus, we have leveraged the unique advantages of both platforms to define the properties of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and their interactions with other cells in CRC.
We first dissected the gene signatures of all 13 myeloid subsets revealed in this study ( Figures 2 A–2C, S4 A-S4B, and Table S2 ). Among these clusters, mast cells (hM01) expressed a unique set of genes, such as TPSAB1/2 , CPA3 , MS4A2 and KIT ( Figure 2 B) and, in contrast to lung cancer ( Lavin et al., 2017 38. Lavin, Y. ∙ Kobayashi, S. ∙ Leader, A. ... Innate Immune Landscape in Early Lung Adenocarcinoma by Paired Single-Cell Analyses Cell. 2017; 169 :750-765.e717 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (855) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed comparable enrichment in both tumors and normal mucosa ( Figure 2 C), in line with their contribution to the homeostasis of gut bacteria and regulation of inflammation in CRC ( Blatner et al., 2010; Krystel-Whittemore et al., 2016 6. Blatner, N.R. ∙ Bonertz, A. ∙ Beckhove, P. ... In colorectal cancer mast cells contribute to systemic regulatory T-cell dysfunction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :6430-6435 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Krystel-Whittemore, M. ∙ Dileepan, K.N. ∙ Wood, J.G. Mast Cell: A Multi-Functional Master Cell Front. Immunol. 2016; 6 :620 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Three DC subsets (hM02-hM04), plasmacytoid DC (pDC), cDC2, and cDC1 cells, characterized by high expression of HLA-DRs and low expression of CD14 ( Figures S4 B and S4C), were also identified and were further distinguished by specific expression of LILRA4/LILRB4 , CD1C/FCER1A , and XCR1/BATF3, respectively ( Figure 2 B). These DCs all showed comparable enrichment in both CRC tumors and normal mucosa ( Figure 2 C). Three blood-enriched clusters (hM05-hM07) were characterized as classical CD14 hi CD16 − , non-classical CD14 + CD16 hi , and intermediate CD14 hi CD16 + monocytes ( Figures S4 A and S4B), largely consistent with previous reports ( Dutertre et al., 2019 19. Dutertre, C.A. ∙ Becht, E. ∙ Irac, S.E. ...

The remaining clusters were identified as macrophages based on their high expression of CD68 , CD163 , and MRC1 (encoding CD206). Among them, clusters showing comparable (hM08) or preferential enrichment (hM09 and hM10) in normal mucosa versus tumors were denoted as resident tissue macrophages (RTMs), whereas the remaining tumor-enriched clusters were denoted as TAMs (hM12-hM13; Figure 2 C). Expression of the proinflammatory cytokine gene, IL1B , was observed in all RTM populations, with NLRP3 + RTMs showing the highest expression ( Figure 2 D), consistent with the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in activation of IL-1β and regulation of intestinal homeostasis ( Zaki et al., 2011 74. Zaki, M.H. ∙ Lamkanfi, M. ∙ Kanneganti, T.D. The Nlrp3 inflammasome: contributions to intestinal homeostasis Trends Immunol. 2011; 32 :171-179 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ). While both NLRP3 + and PLTP + RTMs showed lower expression of the HLA-DR gene compared with IL1B + RTMs, the PLTP + RTMs exhibited specific expression of LYVE1 and IL10 ( Figure 2 D), resembling recently reported Lyve1 hi MHCII lo monocyte-derived RTMs, which mostly reside alongside blood vessels and possessed a critical role in restraining inflammation and fibrosis ( Chakarov et al., 2019 13.

Two distinct interstitial macrophage populations coexist across tissues in specific subtissular niches Science. 2019; 363 :eaau0964 Crossref Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recent studies in mice have suggested that TAMs can originate both from RTMs and newly recruited monocytes that subsequently differentiate into macrophages ( Gubin et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2017 24.

Using RNA velocity analysis ( La Manno et al., 2018 36. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1954) PubMed Google Scholar ) embedded on a diffusion map to infer the future fate of cells, we identified a strong directional flow from CD14-expressing monocytes toward FCN1 + monocyte-like cells and different macrophage populations ( Figure 2 E). Notably, tumor-enriched FCN1 + monocyte-like cells showed high similarity to blood CD14 + monocytes, likely representing a monocyte population migrating into tumors and harboring a tumor-specific transcriptional program ( Figure S4 D).
Further deciphering the transcriptional trajectories of macrophages by two orthogonal algorithms, URD ( Farrell et al., 2018 20. Farrell, J.A. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Riesenfeld, S.J. ... Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis Science. 2018; 360 :eaar3131 Crossref Scopus (465) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PAGA ( Wolf et al., 2019 69. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Hamey, F.K. ∙ Plass, M. ... PAGA: graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :59 Crossref Scopus (711) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggested that FCN1 + monocyte-like cells could subsequently give rise to C1QC + and SPP1 + TAM populations through different RTMs ( Figures 2 F and S4 E). Interestingly, C1QC + TAMs were connected to IL1B + RTMs, and both clusters expressed C1Q complement components and HLA-DR . Of note, IL1B + RTMs exhibited lower expression of APOE and APOC1 compared with C1QC + TAMs ( Figure 2 D), indicating that these cells could partially resemble the functional phenotypes of C1QC + TAMs, but have not upregulated transcriptomic programs related to the response to tumors. Conversely, SPP1 + TAMs were primarily connected to NLRP3 + RTMs, and both clusters expressed low-level of HLA-DR s. Indeed, a fraction of NLRP3 + RTMs were still present inside the tumor ( Figure 2 C), suggesting that they could convert to SPP1 + TAMs in the TME. Collectively, our data suggest that both C1QC + and SPP1 + TAMs develop from tumor-infiltrating monocyte-like precursors, whereas SPP1 + TAMs might also derive from NLRP3 + RTMs ( Figure S4 F). Furthermore, in vitro differentiation studies culturing CD14 + monocytes under normoxic or hypoxic conditions in the presence of cytokines or growth factors that were differentially expressed in TAM populations ( Table S3 A, STAR Methods ) demonstrated that IL-1β and VEGF family members were able to upregulate expression of MARCO , a marker of SPP1 + TAMs, under hypoxic conditions ( Figure S4 G), consistent with the hypothesis that the TME can promote the development of this TAM population. However, fully elucidating the complex macrophage developmental trajectories occurring within tumors and normal tissues require additional in vitro cell differentiation and in vivo lineage tracing studies.
In contrast to breast cancer and lung cancer TAMs that showed a continuous spectrum of phenotypes in the TME ( Azizi et al., 2018; Lambrechts et al., 2018 3. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1184) PubMed Google Scholar 37.

Med. 2018; 24 :1277-1289 Crossref Scopus (1018) PubMed Google Scholar ), the TAMs in CRC exhibited a remarkable dichotomy ( Figure 2 F), suggestive of defined cellular differentiation pathways. Importantly, both TAMs expressed distinct transcription factors, with MAF / MAFB and FOS / JUN in C1QC + TAMs and CEBPB and ZEB2 in SPP1 + TAMs ( Figure S4 H), consistent with the development and function of these two subsets of TAMs being stably controlled by transcriptional networks. Expression analyses based on genes associated with “classically activated” (M1) and “alternatively activated” (M2) macrophages in TAMs ( Azizi et al., 2018 3. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1184) PubMed Google Scholar ) did not explain the dichotomy of C1QC + TAM and SPP1 + TAM identified in CRC ( Figure S4 I, STAR Methods ).
Further comparing the differentially expressed genes between TAM populations revealed that C1QC + TAMs exhibit high expression of complement C1Q genes, TREM2 , MERTK , and CD80 ( Figure 3 A and TableS3 B). In contrast, the SPP1 + TAMs showed specific expression of SPP1 , MARCO , and VEGFA ( Figure 3 A). Evaluating known pathway expression in both TAM populations using gene set variation analysis (GSVA) revealed a strong enrichment of tumor angiogenesis, ECM receptor interaction, and tumor vasculature pathways in SPP1 + TAMs, while the complement activation and antigen processing and presentation pathways were significantly increased in C1QC + TAMs ( Figure 3 B). Strikingly, SPP1 + TAMs additionally exhibited specific enrichment of colorectal adenoma and metastatic liver cancer pathways ( Figures 3 B and 3C), suggesting a pro-tumorigenic/pro-metastatic role in CRC. Multicolor imaging data also confirmed the existence of these two subsets of TAMs by co-expression of CD68, CD80, MAF and CD68, MARCO, VEGFA, respectively ( Figure 3 D). Moreover, only C1QC + TAMs could be identified in the colon mucosa of ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy individuals ( Smillie et al., 2019 61. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730.e722 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas SPP1 + TAMs were largely absent in non-cancer tissues ( Figures S4 J and S4K, STAR Methods ), suggesting their dichotomous functional phenotypes in the CRC TME.
To interrogate global cell-cell interactions in CRC, we performed computational modeling by combining scRNA-seq and TCGA bulk RNA-seq datasets, a method previously used in cancer studies ( Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018; Puram et al., 2017; Tirosh et al., 2016 30.

Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Crossref Scopus (2762) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to identifying genes exhibiting strong correlations with the high abundance of a particular cluster ( Figure S5 A, Table S4 A, STAR Methods ), we also took those highly correlated genes generated from TCGA and matched them back to our scRNA-seq clusters, thus inferring the co-occurrence of specific cell types ( Figure S5 B). By applying computational modeling to all cell subsets enriched in tumor, we established a correlative cell-cell interaction network in CRC. Similar analysis was also performed using the normal tissue dataset from GTEx ( Figure S5 C). These analyses identified known interactions between fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor and between follicular B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the normal mucosa ( Figures 3 E and S5 C), suggesting its potential to identify biologically meaningful interactions between less well-characterized cell types.
In the adjacent normal mucosa, interactions were mainly identified between B cells, T cells and DCs, likely reflecting crosstalk in lymphoid follicles of the colon ( Figure S5 C). In contrast, distinct interactions were identified in tumors, with TAMs and cDCs acting as the core of the predicted network, harboring the most connections with other cell types ( Figure 3 E). While SPP1 + TAMs showed interactions with CAFs and myofibroblasts, C1QC + TAMs and two groups of cDCs mainly interacted with other immune cells, especially T cell subsets ( Figure 3 E), suggesting a function in regulating anti-tumor T cell responses.
To infer molecular interactions mediating cell-cell interactions, we calculated the attraction strengths of ligand-receptor pairs in our scRNA-seq dataset and identified hundreds of interaction pairs displaying significant cell population specificity using a simulation analysis similar to previous methods ( STAR Methods ) ( Ramilowski et al., 2015; Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 55. Ramilowski, J.A. ∙ Goldberg, T. ∙ Harshbarger, J. ... A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signalling in human Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7866 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Vento-Tormo, R. ∙ Efremova, M. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal-fetal interface in humans Nature. 2018; 563 :347-353 Crossref Scopus (1309) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of the ligand-receptor pairs pertaining to myeloid and T cells, CXCL10 - CXCR3 was significantly enriched in C1QC + TAMs ( Figures 3 F, S5 D, and S5E), implicating a potential role of C1QC + TAMs in recruiting or activating T cells. Compared with C1QC + TAMs and other leukocytes, SPP1 + TAMs showed preferential expression of SDC2 , which binds to MMP2 , a gene highly expressed by CAFs and endothelial cells ( Figures 3 F, S5 D, and S5F) and has been reported to be associated with tumor growth and metastasis in multiple cancer types ( Kenny et al., 2008; Zucker and Vacirca, 2004 32. Kenny, H.A. ∙ Kaur, S. ∙ Coussens, L.M. ... The initial steps of ovarian cancer cell metastasis are mediated by MMP-2 cleavage of vitronectin and fibronectin J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 :1367-1379 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar 81. Zucker, S. ∙ Vacirca, J. Role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in colorectal cancer Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2004; 23 :101-117 Crossref Scopus (451) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other ligand-receptor pairs involving interactions between SPP1 + TAMs and other cell subsets included SPP1 - ITGAV and FN1 - ITGA5 , with SPP1 + TAMs expressing higher levels of SPP1 and FN1 ( Figures 3 F, S5 D, and S5F). Our analyses suggest that SPP1 and FN1 may interact with certain integrins to promote tumorigenesis in CRC. Collectively, our scRNA-seq data suggest that TAMs and cDCs comprise the core of a cell-cell interaction network and that TAMs may play dichotomous functions through interacting with distinct immune and stromal cells in the CRC TME.
Next, we sought to study the effect of manipulating distinct myeloid populations on the anti-tumor immune response in mouse tumor models by scRNA-seq and relate these data to our findings on myeloid cell heterogeneity in human. We focused on two therapeutic strategies that have been widely explored in clinical trials: TAM depletion by CSF1R blockade and DC activation by a CD40 agonist. We first evaluated these therapies in multiple syngeneic mouse tumor models, identifying growth of Renca tumors as being sensitive to an anti-CSF1R blocking antibody and growth of MC38 as being sensitive to an anti-CD40 agonist antibody ( Figure S6 A). Based on these findings, multiple scRNA-seq studies were performed using the 10× Genomics platform on immune cells isolated from either Renca tumors following anti-CSF1R treatment ( Figure S6 B) or MC38 tumors and tumor draining lymph nodes (tdLNs) following anti-CD40 treatment ( Figure S6 C).
Graph-based clustering was used to identify the major immune cell subsets, including T cell and myeloid populations, in both Renca and MC38 scRNA-seq datasets ( Figure S6 D and Table S5 ). To better compare tumor-associated murine myeloid cell subsets with those from human, we next integrated and clustered myeloid cells from both models, identifying 15 discrete cell clusters ( Figure 3 G). Each cluster was associated with a unique gene expression pattern indicative of a distinct cell type ( Figure S6 E), and clusters were largely identified in both MC38 and Renca tumors ( Figure S6 F). To identify relationships between human and mouse populations, we performed a systematic similarity analysis, identifying multiple corresponding myeloid populations across species ( Figure 3 H).
Focusing first on cDC populations, we identified two murine cDC1 subsets (mM06 and mM07) ( Figure S6 G), both of which were mapped to a single cDC1 cluster (hM04) in human CRC ( Figure 3 H). Further evaluation of heterogeneity within the human BATF3 + cDC1 cluster by re-clustering these cells found evidence for both phenotypes of cDC1 cells within human ( Figure S6 H). Notably, these two cDC1 phenotypes resemble known immature and activated states of cDC1 cells ( Ardouin et al., 2016 2. Ardouin, L. ∙ Luche, H. ∙ Chelbi, R. ... Broad and Largely Concordant Molecular Changes Characterize Tolerogenic and Immunogenic Dendritic Cell Maturation in Thymus and Periphery Immunity. 2016; 45 :305-318 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) and recently described “activated” LAMP3 + CCR7 + DCs in both human and mouse tumors ( Figure S6 I) ( Zhang et al., 2019; Zilionis et al., 2019 77. Zhang, Q. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Luo, N. ... Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell. 2019; 179 :829-845.e820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (836) PubMed Google Scholar 80.

We also identified two cDC2 clusters in murine tumors (mM04 and mM05) that mapped to a single cDC2 population in human CRC (hM03) ( Figure 3 H). Of note, the Itgax + cDC2 cluster likely represents a classical cDC2 subset, whereas Cd209a + cDC2 cluster shares features with monocyte-derived DCs that may differentiate from newly infiltrated blood monocytes ( Cheong et al., 2010 14. Cheong, C. ∙ Matos, I. ∙ Choi, J.H. ... Microbial stimulation fully differentiates monocytes to DC-SIGN/CD209(+) dendritic cells for immune T cell areas Cell. 2010; 143 :416-429 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In contrast to DC populations, TAMs showed a greater degree of phenotypic heterogeneity between mouse and human, in line with recent observations in lung cancer ( Zilionis et al., 2019 80. Zilionis, R. ∙ Engblom, C. ∙ Pfirschke, C. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Human and Mouse Lung Cancers Reveals Conserved Myeloid Populations across Individuals and Species Immunity. 2019; 50 :1317-1334.e1310 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (812) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, mouse macrophage clusters (mM11-mM14) showed the highest similarity to human C1QC + TAMs and minimal overlapping gene expression with human SPP1 + TAMs. In contrast, mouse macrophage cluster mM15_Macro-Vegfa showed the greatest similarity with human SPP1 + TAMs ( Figure 3 H). Performing a similar pathway analysis on mouse TAM subsets as was used for human TAM clusters ( Figure 3 B), we found that mouse TAM populations also segregate on the basis of their angiogenic, hypoxic, and T cell interaction gene signatures ( Figure 4 A). These data suggest the presence of functionally analogous TAM populations between human CRC patients and mouse tumor models.
We next sought to elucidate the effects of anti-CSF1R on TAM populations in mouse and relate these findings to corresponding populations in human. As expected, treatment of mice bearing Renca tumors with anti-CSF1R decreased the frequency of TAMs relative to treatment with a control antibody ( Figure 4 B). However, a detectable population of TAMs remained following anti-CSF1R treatment. Further evaluation of this anti-CSF1R resistant population showed a preferential decrease in macrophages expressing high levels of F4/80 ( Figures S7 A–S7D), suggesting differential sensitivity of distinct macrophage populations to anti-CSF1R treatment. Consistent with these findings, analysis of scRNA-seq data from Renca tumors revealed a near complete loss of clusters mM12 and mM14, but minimal reduction of TAM clusters mM11, mM13, and mM15 following anti-CSF1R treatment ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Indeed, the frequencies of certain clusters increased in the anti-CSF1R treatment groups ( Figure 4 D), likely due to the loss of a large macrophage population from the total pool of immune cells. We further examined how differential sensitivity of TAM populations to anti-CSF1R treatment could alter the TME. We found that anti-CSF1R-resistant TAMs preferentially express genes involved in angiogenesis, such as Vegfa , and immunosuppression, such as Cd274 and Arg1 ( Figure 4 E). Notably, macrophages remaining in the tumor following anti-CSF1R treatment also appeared to be preferentially associated with tumor vasculature ( Figure 4 F) ( DeNardo et al., 2011 18. DeNardo, D.G. ∙ Brennan, D.J. ∙ Rexhepaj, E. ... Leukocyte complexity predicts breast cancer survival and functionally regulates response to chemotherapy Cancer Discov. 2011; 1 :54-67 Crossref Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggestive of a role in regulating angiogenic processes.
Given the role of CSF1R signaling in controlling macrophage homeostasis ( Hume et al., 2019 29. Hume, D.A. ∙ Irvine, K.M. ∙ Pridans, C. The Mononuclear Phagocyte System: The Relationship between Monocytes and Macrophages Trends Immunol. 2019; 40 :98-112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next evaluated whether TAM proliferation correlated with sensitivity to anti-CSF1R treatment. Anti-CSF1R-sensitive populations (mM12, mM14) had elevated expression of Mki67 and a higher proliferation score than resistant populations (mM11, mM13, mM15) ( Figures 4 E and 4G). Notably, in human tumors, C1QC + TAMs also have a higher proliferation score than SPP1 + TAMs ( Figure 4 H). These data suggest that in mice, CSF1R blockade results in preferential depletion of macrophages in cell cycle, leading to differential effects of this treatment across TAM subsets. Extrapolating these findings to humans, CSF1R blockade may preferentially deplete a fraction of the C1QC + TAM subset, while sparing SPP1 + TAMs. To further relate our findings in mice to human CRC, we compared patient survival across individuals with different levels of C1QC + TAM and SPP1 + TAM gene signatures and found that a low C1QC + TAM and high SPP1 + TAM gene signature combination correlated with worse prognostic outcome in CRC patients ( Figure 4 I). These findings suggest that anti-CSF1R treatment may be insufficient to deplete all macrophage populations with tumor growth-promoting potential, a property that may underlie the poor monotherapy efficacy of anti-CSF1R in the Renca mouse tumor model and in human cancer patients.
Next, we focused on dissecting the mechanisms of anti-CD40 agonist therapy. Treatment of mice bearing MC38 tumors with anti-CD40 led to reduced tumor growth ( Figure S6 A), which was further enhanced in combination with PD1 blockade ( Figures 5 A and 5B). scRNA-seq analyses from both human CRC and mouse MC38 tumor samples revealed that CD40 was expressed on multiple DC and macrophage subsets, especially cDC1 clusters ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Consistent with these findings and our cell-cell interaction network analysis ( Figure 3 E) showing the extensive interactions of cDCs with various T cell subsets ( Figure 5 E and Table S4 B), we found that CD40LG was highly expressed on multiple CD4 + T cell clusters in human and mouse tumors ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Although the CD40/CD40LG pathway is known to modulate the interaction between myeloid cells and T cells ( Grewal and Flavell, 1998 23. Grewal, I.S. ∙ Flavell, R.A. CD40 and CD154 in cell-mediated immunity Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16 :111-135 Crossref Scopus (1364) PubMed Google Scholar ), we aimed to identify specific myeloid and T cell subsets that were preferentially impacted by CD40 agonism.
Analysis of scRNA-seq data from different time points following treatment revealed anti-CD40 agonist-mediated enhancement of Ccl22 + cDC1 cell frequency, while other DC subsets were either decreased or unchanged on day 2 after treatment ( Figure 5 F). Anti-CD40 antibody also markedly activated these cDC1 cells, as measured by increased CD80 and CD86 expression ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Further, anti-CD40 increased cDC1 cell production of IL-12 ( Figure 5 I), a cytokine that enhances Th1 development and IFNγ production by CD8 + T cells ( Tait Wojno et al., 2019 62. Tait Wojno, E.D. ∙ Hunter, C.A. ∙ Stumhofer, J.S. The Immunobiology of the Interleukin-12 Family: Room for Discovery Immunity. 2019; 50 :851-870 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the effects of anti-CD40 antibody on TAMs were less pronounced ( Figure S7 E), we observed transient reduction of Mafb + TAMs at day 2 and significant reduction of Maf + TAMs at day 10 post-treatment ( Figure S7 E), which may be reflective of widespread changes in tumor-associated immune cell frequency induced by CD40 agonist treatment. Thus, our scRNA-seq analyses identified Ccl22 + cDC1 cells as the primarily myeloid cell type that is activated early after anti-CD40 antibody treatment in the MC38 model. Importantly, signature genes of activated cDC1s positively correlated with favorable overall survival of CRC patients ( Figure 5 J), suggesting that the ability of anti-CD40 to activate these cells may have relevance to human cancer.
We next investigated the consequences of anti-CD40 treatment on the function of tumor-infiltrating T cells. scRNA-seq analysis of T cells from the MC38 tumor model ( Figures S7 F and S7G) demonstrated that the frequency of certain CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets were affected by CD40 agonist treatment ( Figure 6 A). Since we also captured TCR α- and β- chain sequences from scRNA-seq ( Table S6 A), we used the previously developed STARTRAC indices to define the clonal expansion, migration and developmental transition of T cells ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Anti-CD40 treatment significantly increased the proportion of tumor memory CD8 + T cell subsets but reduced the frequency of exhausted CD8 + T cell subsets, especially at 10 days post-treatment ( Figure 6 B). Moreover, anti-CD40 treatment significantly changed the expression profiles and kinetics of exhaustion markers in Lag3 + Tex and Mki67 + Tex subsets, with expression of Ctla4 and Tigit being rapidly reduced upon treatment and a significant reduction in Pdcd1 and Lag3 expression observed at 10 days post-treatment ( Figure 6 C). Flow cytometry confirmed these scRNA-seq findings, demonstrating that anti-CD40 treatment increases effector CD8 + T cells and reduces PD1 + exhausted CD8 + T cells in tumor ( Figures 6 D–6G). Using STARTRAC analysis, we found that Ccl5 + Tem CD8 + T cells had a higher migration index than other CD8 + T cell subsets upon anti-CD40 treatment ( Figure S7 H), consistent with our earlier findings that CD8 + Tem cells are more migratory than Trm or exhausted CD8 + T cells ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, anti-CD40 treatment dramatically increased the proportion of Ccl5 + Tem CD8 + T cells, but not the Cxcr6 + Trm population in tdLNs ( Figure S7 I). Further dissecting the TCR clonotypes within the Ccl5 + Tem subset revealed that those cells with higher clonal expansion exhibited more TCR sharing between tumor and tdLN, indicative of more profound mobility of these cells upon anti-CD40 treatment ( Figures 6 H, 6I, S7 J and Table S6 B). In addition, the transition index between Ccl5 + Tem and Cxcr6 + Trm CD8 + T cells was significantly higher than that of other pairs among CD8 + T cell subsets at baseline, suggesting that certain Cxcr6 + Trm cells in tumor may be derived from infiltrated Ccl5 + Tem cells, in a process that was further enhanced by anti-CD40 treatment ( Figure 6 J). Taken together, our data reveal unique effects of anti-CD40 treatment on the expansion, migration, and transition of tumor-infiltrating Tem and Trm CD8 + T cells.
We found that CD40 agonist treatment also had a dramatic impact on tumor-infiltrating CD4 + T cell subsets. Although anti-CD40 treatment significantly amplified Treg cells at 2 days post-treatment, the proportion of Treg cells was reduced at 10 days post-anti-CD40 treatment compared to control-treated groups ( Figure 7 A). STARTRAC-expansion index confirmed that anti-CD40 treatment enhanced Treg expansion on day 2 and constrained their expansion on day 10 ( Figure 7 B). In contrast, anti-CD40 treatment specifically increased the proportion of Bhlhe40 + Th1-like cells on both day 2 and day 10, which was confirmed by anti-CD40 triggered clonal expansion of these cells on both days ( Figure 7 B). Interestingly, we noticed that anti-CD40 treatment significantly induced the expression of Cd40lg on Bhlhe40 + Th1-like cells in our scRNA-seq dataset ( Figures 7 C and 7D), a finding that was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 7 E). These data suggest that a CD40 agonist might be able to further enhance the crosstalk of tumor-associated BHLHE40 + Th1-like cells and cDC1 cells.
We previously identified IFNG-expressing BHLHE40 + Th1-like cells as being enriched in the MSI CRC patient population, which shows favorable response to ICB therapy ( Le et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018 39. Le, D.T. ∙ Uram, J.N. ∙ Wang, H. ... PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (7346) PubMed Google Scholar 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed that Bhlhe40 + CD4 + T cells isolated from mouse MC38 tumors also expressed higher Bhlhe40 ( Figure S7 K) and produced significantly more IFNγ than other effector CD4 + T cells ( Figures 7 F and 7G), expressed the proliferation marker Ki67 by FACS, and were further induced to proliferate by anti-CD40 treatment ( Figure 7 H). Thus, anti-CD40 activation of tumor cDC1 cells may result in increased frequency of IFNγ-producing tumor-infiltrating CD4 + Th cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vitro studies demonstrated that anti-CD40 treatment promoted DC maturation which further increased the expression of Bhlhe40 , but not Tbx21 , in CD4 + T cells stimulated with suboptimal concentrations of antigen ( Figures 7 I and S7 L-S7M). Further analyzing the correlation of IFNG-expressing BHLHE40 + Th1-like cells and cDC cells in human CRC patients revealed that a gene signature of Th1-like cells exhibited preferentially positive correlation with both mature and immature cDC1 cells. These cDC1 cells were also significantly enriched in MSI-H CRC patients ( Figure 7 J), suggesting a crosstalk between cDC1 cells and BHLHE40 + Th1-like cells. Importantly, our finding that anti-CD40 increased Bhlhe40 + Th1-like cells may provide a mechanistic explanation for why CD40 agonist treatment can successfully synergize with anti-PD1 in this model ( Figures 5 A and 5B).

Section: Discussion

Here, we have leveraged the advantages of two scRNA-seq approaches to generate an atlas of immune and non-immune cells from human CRC patients. Classifying these cells into specific lineages and deducing a cell-cell interaction network ( Figure S8 A) revealed specific populations of myeloid cells as central nodes of interaction, leading us to focus on their functions in human and pre-clinical mouse tumor models ( Figures S8 B and S8C). In contrast to the relative stable phenotypes of lymphocyte, stromal, and DC subsets across different tissues and cancer types, the distinct characteristics of macrophages appeared to be dependent on their tissue/tumor origins ( Azizi et al., 2018; Chevrier et al., 2017; Lambrechts et al., 2018; Lavin et al., 2017; Venteicher et al., 2017; Zilionis et al., 2019 3.

Med. 2018; 24 :1277-1289 Crossref Scopus (1018) PubMed Google Scholar ), in this study we identified two distinct TAM populations in CRC, consisting of C1QC + and SPP1 + TAMs, both of which may arise from an intermediate state of FCN1 + monocyte-like cells in the tumor. Consistent with previous studies, neither of these populations fit the M1 and M2 dichotomous phenotypes ( Azizi et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2017 3. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ...

Rather, C1QC + TAMs showed preferential expression of genes involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation, while SPP1 + TAMs were enriched for regulators of angiogenesis. Only SPP1 + TAMs exhibited preferential enrichment in tumor compared to normal mucosa from healthy donors, suggesting their key roles in the tumorigenesis of CRC.
Depleting immunosuppressive TAMs is an attractive therapeutic approach to promote anti-tumor immune responses. However, their heterogeneity, diverse functions, and predicted cell-cell interaction patterns argues for more subset-specific strategies. Indeed, although CSF1R blockade can result in significant TAM depletion, CSF1R inhibition has provided minimal therapeutic benefit in cancer patients as a monotherapy ( Papadopoulos et al., 2017; Ries et al., 2014 50. Papadopoulos, K.P. ∙ Gluck, L. ∙ Martin, L.P. ... First-in-Human Study of AMG 820, a Monoclonal Anti-Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor Antibody, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Clin.

Targeting tumor-associated macrophages with anti-CSF-1R antibody reveals a strategy for cancer therapy Cancer Cell. 2014; 25 :846-859 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1002) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent data suggest multiple compensatory mechanisms may limit the anti-tumor activity of CSF1R blockade, including treatment-induced recruitment of Foxp3 + Tregs or myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations ( Gyori et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2017 26.

Neubert, N.J. ∙ Schmittnaegel, M. ∙ Bordry, N. ... T cell-induced CSF1 promotes melanoma resistance to PD1 blockade Sci Transl Med. 2018; 10 :eaan3311 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar 53.

Our data identified murine TAM subsets that are both refractory to depletion by anti-CSF1R and show similarity with human SPP1 + TAMs that have a pro-angiogenic signature and, based on predicted cell-cell interaction network, likely engage in crosstalk with CAFs and endothelial cells. Thus, persistence of this population, and loss of pro-inflammatory C1QC + TAM populations, may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism of resistance to indiscriminate macrophage depletion via anti-CSF1R therapy. Together with the poor prognosis of patients with high SPP1 + and low C1QC + TAM signatures, our findings suggest that specific depletion of SPP1 + TAMs could ultimately lead to improved myeloid-targeted immunotherapy or enhanced combination with ICB therapies.
The importance of understanding DC subtypes is similarly demonstrated. Of the cDC1 subsets identified in both MC38 and Renca mouse tumors by scRNA-seq, only one (mM06) expresses the classical cDC1 markers Clec9a and Xcr1 . In contrast, Ccl22 + cDC1s (mM07) bear similarities to the CD40 + CCR7 + LAMP3 + subpopulation of cDC1 cells in human CRC and tumor-associated LAMP3 + DCs recently described by others ( Zhang et al., 2019; Zilionis et al., 2019 77. Zhang, Q. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Luo, N. ... Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell. 2019; 179 :829-845.e820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (836) PubMed Google Scholar 80.

Previous studies demonstrated that murine cDC1 cells downregulate Xcr1 and Clec9a expression when they mature or become activated ( Ardouin et al., 2016; Merad et al., 2013 2. Ardouin, L. ∙ Luche, H. ∙ Chelbi, R. ...

Immunol. 2013; 31 :563-604 Crossref Scopus (1742) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting Ccl22 + cDC1 cells may be activated cDC1s and not a developmentally distinct subset. Importantly, CD40 agonist treatment significantly increased the frequency Ccl22 + cDC1 cells in MC38 tumors without drastic effects on other myeloid subsets, suggesting that these activated DCs are preferentially targeted by CD40 agonists to promote anti-tumor immune responses.
Our human cell-cell interaction analyses predicted an unexpected interaction between the BATF3 + cDC1 population and both exhausted CD8 + T cells as well as a distinct population of the BHLHE40 + Th1-like cells. While we did not observe significant frequency changes in exhausted CD8 + T cells following anti-CD40 treatment, the expression level of several inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 was reduced. Interestingly, a rapid expansion of Bhlhe40 + Th1-like CD4 + T cells, similar to those cells identified in MSI CRC ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ), was observed upon anti-CD40 treatment that preceded an increase in the frequency of memory CD8 + T cells. Given that CD40-mediated activation of DCs promoted Bhlhe40 expression in CD4 + T cells in vitro and the kinetics of CD40-mediated activation of different immune cells in vivo , including cDC1 activation, Bhlhe40 + Th1-like CD4 + T cell expansion, and memory CD8 + T cell infiltration, we postulate that the expansion of Bhlhe40 + Th1-like CD4 + T cells may be downstream of Ccl22 + cDC1 activation. These Bhlhe40 + T cells may potentiate cDC1-mediated CD8 + T cell infiltration, expansion, and anti-tumor function by providing positive feedback signals to cDC1 cells, in part via their high Cd40lg expression. Although the pathways regulating BHLHE40 expression in T cells are not well defined, it has been shown that TCR activation and cytokines such as IL-1β produced by activated myeloid cells may contribute to its induction ( Lin et al., 2016 43. Lin, C.C. ∙ Bradstreet, T.R. ∙ Schwarzkopf, E.A. ... IL-1-induced Bhlhe40 identifies pathogenic T helper cells in a model of autoimmune neuroinflammation J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :251-271 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting potential mechanisms by which anti-CD40 may promote the generation of Bhlhe40 + T cells. Targeted cell-depletion studies will help further define the precise role of the intratumoral cellular interactions in CD40 agonist-mediated responses. Nevertheless, our study provides an in-depth understanding of mechanisms regulating CD40 agonist activity and further supports the importance of Bhlhe40 + Th1-like CD4 + T cells in anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy.
Taken together, our study reveals previously unappreciated myeloid-T cell and myeloid-stromal connections within CRC, providing mechanistic insights for immunotherapies currently in clinical development, and demonstrates an approach for dissecting the role of specific tumor-associated immune populations through complementary single cell analysis of both human and mouse tumors. Additionally, our datasets, as provided in an interactive portal ( http://crcleukocyte.cancer-pku.cn/ ), can be used as a resource for further exploration of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in human and mouse.

Eighteen colorectal cancer patients, including fourteen females and four males, were enrolled and pathologically diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma at Peking University People’s Hospital. Written informed consent was provided by all patients. This study was approved by the Research and Ethical Committee of Peking University People’s Hospital and complied with all relevant ethical regulations. Fresh tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples (at least 2 cm from matched tumor tissues) were surgically resected from the above-described patients. All patients, except P0309, P0411, P0720, P1025, and P1212, had peripheral blood and paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues obtained. Patients P0309, P0411, and P1212 had fresh tumor tissues and matched peripheral blood, while patients P0720 and P1025 had fresh tumor tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues. Their ages ranged from 40 to 89 with a median of 68.5. None of them were treated with chemotherapy or radiation prior to tumor resection. The stages of these patients were classified according to the guidance of AJCC version 8. Among these patients, one was diagnosed at stage I, eleven at stage II, and six at stage III. While we did not purposely exclude stage IV patients, none of these patients had distal metastasis, as evidence by the enhanced CT results for abdomen, chest, and pelvic areas before surgery. The available clinical characteristics are summarized in Table S1 .
All animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Amgen, Inc. All mice were female and sourced from Charles River Laboratories (Hollister, CA site) or The Jackson Laboratory (Sacramento, CA site) and were provided water and chow ad libitum and maintained in a pathogen-free facility. Mice used in syngeneic tumor experiments were 6-8 weeks of age at the time implant. MC38 or Renca cells in serum-free RPMI were inoculated in the right flank at 3 × 10 5 cells per implant and allowed to grow for 8-10 days (MC38) or 12 days (Renca). The mice were then randomized by tumor volume (50-100mm 3 ) and treated with the described antibodies.
For MC38 studies, isotype control treatment antibodies were rat IgG2a from BioXCell (2A3) and Amgen in-house generated mouse IgG1. Anti-CD40 antibodies were clone FGK45 (rat IgG2a) from BioXCell and in-house generated FGK45 (mouse IgG1). Anti-PD1 antibody was the 29F1A.12 clone (rat IgG2a) from BioXCell. All anti-CD40 treatments and corresponding isotype controls were diluted in PBS and administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 5mg/kg. Anti-PD1 treatment and the corresponding isotype control was diluted in PBS and administered i.p. at 15mg/kg. For efficacy studies, tumors were measured twice a week with digital calipers and tracked using StudyLog until the end of study (twice the median survival of the isotype treated groups). For pharmacodynamic studies, tumors were taken down 24-48 h and 6 days post-initiation of anti-CD40 treatments for tissue collection ( Figure S6 A)
For Renca studies, isotype control treatment antibodies were mouse IgG1 from BioXCell (MOPC-21). Rat Anti-mouse CSF1R M279 was generated at Amgen ( MacDonald et al., 2010 44. MacDonald, K.P. ∙ Palmer, J.S. ∙ Cronau, S. ... An antibody against the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor depletes the resident subset of monocytes and tissue- and tumor-associated macrophages but does not inhibit inflammation Blood. 2010; 116 :3955-3963 Crossref Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ) and converted to a mouse IgG1 antibody backbone. All anti-CSF1R treatments and corresponding isotype controls were diluted in PBS and administered i.p. at 400 μg/mouse three times a week for a total of four doses. For efficacy and pharmacodynamic studies, tumors were measured as above and analyzed at 24 h after the last dose on day 8 post-initiation of anti-CSF1R treatment ( Figure S6 A).
Single cells were collected from tumor and adjacent normal tissues as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, tumors and adjacent normal tissues were cut into approximately 1 mm 3 pieces in the RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sciencell), and enzymatically digested with MACS tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min on a rotor at 37°C, according to manufacturer’s instruction. The dissociated cells were subsequently passed through a 70 μm Cell-Strainer (BD) and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min. After the supernatant was removed, the pelleted cells were suspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (Solarbio) and incubated on ice for 2 min to lyse red blood cells. After washing twice with 1 × PBS (Invitrogen), the cell pellets were re-suspended in sorting buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% FBS).
PBMCs were isolated using HISTOPAQUE-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) solution as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2017 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar 78. Zheng, C. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Yoo, J.K. ... Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing Cell. 2017; 169 :1342-1356.e1316 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1383) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 4 mL of fresh peripheral blood was collected prior to surgery in EDTA anticoagulant tubes and subsequently layered onto HISTOPAQUE-1077. After centrifugation, lymphocyte cells remained at the plasma-HISTOPAQUE-1077 interface and were carefully transferred to a new tube and washed twice with 1 × PBS. Red blood cells were removed via the same procedure described above. These lymphocytes were re-suspended in sorting buffer.
Single cell suspensions collected from CRC samples were stained with antibodies against CD45 for FACS sorting, performed on a BD Aria III instrument. To enrich myeloid cells, single cells were further enriched either by gating CD3 − , CD3 − CD19 − /CD79A − or CD3 − CD19 − CD56 − cells to exclude lymphoid cells. For B cells and NK cells, single cells were enriched by gating 7AAD − CD45 + CD3 − CD19 + CD56 − and 7AAD − CD45 + CD3 − CD19 − CD56 + . For non-immune cells, single cells were enriched by gating 7AAD − CD45 − For Patient P0104, P0305, P0309, P0411, P0720, P0728, P1212, P1228, P0413, and P0825, single-cell RNA-seq were performed by the SMART-seq2 platform.
Based on FACS analysis, single cells were sorted into 96-well plates (Axygen) chilled to 4°C, prepared with lysis buffer with 1 μl 10 mM dNTP mix (Invitrogen), 1 μl 10 μM Oligo dT primer, 1.9 μl 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and 0.1 μl 40 U/μl RNase Inhibitor (Takara). The single cell lysates were sealed and stored frozen at −80°C immediately. Single cell transcriptome amplifications were performed according to the Smart-Seq2 protocol ( Zhang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2017 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar 78. Zheng, C. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Yoo, J.K. ... Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing Cell. 2017; 169 :1342-1356.e1316 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1383) PubMed Google Scholar ). The External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC, Ambion; 1: 4,000,000) was added into each well as the exogenous spike-in control before the reverse transcription. The amplified cDNA products were purified with 1 × Agencourt XP DNA beads (Beckman). A procedure of quality control (QC) was performed following the first round of purification, which included the detection of GAPDH by qPCR and fragment analysis by analyzer AATI. For those single cell samples with high quality after QC (cycle threshold < 30), the DNA products were further purified with 0.5 × Agencourt XP DNA beads, and the concentration of each sample was quantified by Qubit HsDNA kits (Invitrogen). Multiplex (384-plex) libraries were constructed and amplified using the TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for Illumina (Vazyme Biotech). The libraries were then purified with Agencourt XP DNA beads and pooled for quality assessment by fragment analyzer. For all the 10 patients, purified libraries were analyzed by an Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencer with 150-bp paired-end reads.
Single cell suspensions collected from CRC samples were stained with antibodies against CD45 for FACS sorting, performed on a BD Aria III instrument. To enrich myeloid cells, single cells were further enriched either by gating CD3 − or CD3 − CD19 − CD79A − CD56 − cells to exclude lymphoid cells. For T and monocyte-lineage cells, single cells were enriched by gating 7AAD − CD45 + CD3 + and 7AAD − CD45 + CD3 − CD14 + cells, respectively. For Patient P0104, P0123, P0202, P0305, P0323, P0408, P0410, P0613, P1025, P1026, single-cell RNA-seq were performed by the 10× Genomic single cell 3′ library platform. Based on FACS analysis, single cells were sorted into 1.5 mL tubes (Eppendorf) and counted manually under the microscope. The concentration of single cell suspensions was adjusted to 300-350 cells/ul. Cells were loaded between 7,000 and 10,000 cells/chip position using the Chromium Single cell 3′ Library, Gel Bead & Multiplex Kit and Chip Kit (10× Genomics, V2 barcoding chemistry) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All the subsequent steps were performed following the standard manufacturer’s protocols. Purified libraries were analyzed by an Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencer with 150-bp paired-end reads.
MC38 tissues were mechanically disrupted and digested with Collagenase D (Roche, 0.5 mg/mL) and DNase I (Roche, 40 U/mL). Renca tumor tissues were disrupted in Liberase TL (Roche, 0.2 mg/mL) and DNase I (Roche, 20 U/mL) in RPMI with 2% FBS (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Disruption was performed as follows: 1 × MACS program h_tumor_03 (MC38) or h_tumor_01 (Renca) using gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec), followed by incubation at 37°C for 15 min, and further disruption by 2 × MACS program h_tumor_02. After disruption, cells were passed through a 70 μm filter and washed with RPMI containing 10% FBS. The single cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in RPMI with 10% FBS. For sorting cells, MC38 tumor tissues were mechanically disrupted and prepared as above in the absence of Collagenase D and DNase I. For some scRNA-seq experiments, Renca tumor tissues used for scRNA-seq were digested in the presence of 20 μM Actinomycin D (Sigma), and 5μM Actinomycin D was maintained in all downstream staining and sorting steps to minimize artifactual transcriptional changes during tissue processing ( Wu et al., 2017 71. Wu, Y.E. ∙ Pan, L. ∙ Zuo, Y. ... Detecting Activated Cell Populations Using Single-Cell RNA-Seq Neuron. 2017; 96 :313-329.e316 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Groups of MC38 tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice were i.p. injected either with anti-CD40 antibody or isotype control antibody. MC38 tumors and tumor draining lymph nodes (tdLNs) were harvested at day 2 or day 10 post-injection ( Figure S6 B). Tissues were processed, and single cell suspensions were prepared as described above. For staining of cell surface proteins, cells were incubated with appropriate antibody mixes for 30 min at 4°C. Cells from 3 different tumors and tdLNs were sorted into CD45 + cells, Thy1.2 + TCRβ + for T cells, CD11c + MHCII + for DC populations with BD FACSAria cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data acquisition of antibody stained samples was carried out on an LSR-II (BD Bisociences) and analyzed with FlowJo software v10.3 (Tree Star Inc.).
For scRNA-seq analysis of immune cells from Renca tumors, two independent studies were performed for both studies, groups of Renca tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were i.p. injected with either anti-CSF1R antibody or isotype control antibody ( Figure S6 C). Tissues were processed, and single cell suspensions were prepared as described above. For staining of cell surface proteins, cells were incubated with appropriate antibody mixes for 30 min at 4°C and cells were sorted into bulk CD45 + cells, CD45 + CD3 + T cells, and CD45 + CD3 − B220 − Ly6G − Ly6C − macrophage/DC enriched populations with a BD FACSMelody TM (BD Biosciences). Sorted cell subsets were combined at a ratio of 75% enriched macrophage/DC cells and 25% bulk CD45 + cells (Study 1), or 65% bulk CD45 + cells, 25% enriched macrophage/DC cells, and 10% T cells (Study 2). Study 1 and Study 2 data were combined for all graph-based clustering analysis of immune populations ( Figures 3 G and 4 C). Study 2 data were used for quantification of myeloid cluster frequency in isotype control versus anti-CSF1R antibody treated groups ( Figure 4 D).
Sorted cell subsets were loaded on the 10× Chromium system and were encapsulated using the Single Cell 5′ Library & Gel Bead Kit (10× Genomics). Single-cell gene expression and TCR libraries were generated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Completed libraries were sequenced on HiSeq4000 (Illumina) or NovaSeq (Illumina) platforms at a targeted median read depth of 50,000 reads per cell from total gene expression libraries and 5,000 reads per cell for TCR libraries (cycle specifications 150:8:0:150 [R1:i7:i5:R2]).
For immunofluorescence imaging of Renca tumors, whole tumors were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS overnight and dehydrated in 30% sucrose/PBS prior to embedding in OCT freezing medium. 16 μm sections were cut on a cryostat, adhered to Superfrost Plus slides (ThermoFisher) and permeabilized/blocked with PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch). Sections were stained with directly conjugated antibodies in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Diamond with DAPI (Invitrogen) and images captured on an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging).
For intracellular cytokine production of IFNγ and TNFα, cells were stimulated with cell stimulation cocktail plus protein transport inhibitors (ThermoFisher) for 2 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat in-activated-FBS (GIBCO). For detecting intracellular IL-12 cytokine, MC38 tumor bearing mice were i.p. injected with anti-CD40 antibody (100ug/mouse) or control isotype. Tumors were harvested 2 days after i.p. injection of antibody and they were incubated with Brefeldin A solution (Biolegend) for 3 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in RPMI medium containing 10% heat in-activated-FBS. Single cell suspension was obtained after tumor digestion described as above and stained with surface markers followed by staining with IL-12. To determine expression of intracellular proteins, cells were fixed for 30 min at 4°C using Foxp3 Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (ThermoFisher) following manufacturer’s protocol.
Genomic DNA of peripheral blood and tissue samples of CRC patients were extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s specification. The concentrations of DNA were quantified using the Qubit HsDNA Kits (Invitrogen) and the qualities of DNA were evaluated with agarose gel electrophoresis. Exon libraries were constructed using the SureSelectXT Human All Exon V5 capture library (Agilent). Samples were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencer with 150-bp paired-end reads.
Microsatellite instability testing was performed as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, DNA purified from tumor tissues of CRC patients using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) was subjected to multiplex fluorescent PCR-based assay (Promega) by amplifying 7 loci including 5 mononucleotide repeats (NR21, BAT26, BAT25, NR24, and Mono27) and 2 pentanucleotide repeats (PentaC and PentaD) and was compared with DNA extracted from matched adjacent normal tissues. Multiplex PCR products were analyzed by ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Patients were defined as MSI-H status by the presence of two or more mononucleotide loci showing instability. MSS was defined as no loci of instability. Among 18 patients in this study, 3 of them were MSI-H (P0123, P0413 and P0825), and the other 15 patients were MSS.
Specimens were collected from Peking University People’s Hospital within 30 min after the tumor resection and fixed in 10% formalin for 48 h. Dehydration and embedding in paraffin was performed as the following routine methods ( Zheng et al., 2017 78. Zheng, C. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Yoo, J.K. ... Landscape of Infiltrating T Cells in Liver Cancer Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing Cell. 2017; 169 :1342-1356.e1316 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1383) PubMed Google Scholar ). Paraffin blocks were cut into 5 μm sections and adhered to a glass slideheated at 70°C for 1 h, deparaffinized in xylene, and then rehydrated in 100%, 90%, 70% alcohol successively. Presence of TAMs was confirmed using the Opal 7-Color Manual IHC Kit (PerkinElmer, NEL811001KT) according to the protocol of the manufacturer as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, antigen was retrieved by AR9 buffer (pH 6.0, PerkinElmer) and boiled in the oven for 15 min. Samples were blocked at room temperature for 10 min, incubated at room temperature for 1 h with mouse anti-human CD68 (Abcam, clone KP1, 1:100), rabbit anti-human CD80 (Abcam, clone EPR1157(2), 1:200), rabbit anti-human c-Maf (Abcam, clone EPR16484, 1:200), rabbit anti-human Macro (Abcam, 1:100), and mouse anti-human VEGFA (Abcam, clone VG-1, 1:200). A secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (PerkinElmer) was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Signal amplification was performed using TSA working solution diluted at 1:100 in 1 × amplification diluent (PerkinElmer) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The multispectral imaging was collected by Mantra Quantitative Pathology Workstation (PerkinElmer, CLS140089) at 20 × magnification and analyzed by InForm Advanced Image Analysis Software (PerkinElmer) version 2.3. For each patient, a total of 8-15 high-power fields were taken based on their tumor sizes.
2 × 10 6 OT-II splenocytes were plated in 48-well plates with either 10, 100, or 1000 nM Ova 323-339 peptide (Anaspec). Anti-CD40 (clone FGK45) or mouse IgG1 isotype control (BioXCell) antibodies were added at 10 μg/ml, and then cultures were incubated for 3 days. CD4 + T cells were enriched by magnetic selection (mouse CD4 + T cell isolation kit, Miltenyi), then subjected to RNA enrichment (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen) and cDNA first strand synthesis (SuperScript IV, Invitrogen). Bhlhe40 and Tbx21 transcript levels were then quantified using a Viia 7 RT-PCR system and predesigned TaqMan gene expression arrays (ThermoFisher). Relative expression refers to Bhlhe40 or Tbx21 expression normalized to a control gene, Rpl19 . Immune cell phenotypes were evaluated by flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining as described above.
Human peripheral blood monocytes were prepared by density centrifugation of whole blood diluted 1:3 in Lymphoprep (Accurate Chemical) in 50 mL Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One) followed by enrichment for CD14 + CD16 − cells via negative selection using the Classical Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi). Monocytes were seeded at 1 × 10 5 cells/well in 96-well plates in X-Vivo 10 medium (Lonza) containing 50ng/mL CSF1 or GM-CSF (PeproTech) and the indicated factors (all from PeproTech). Plates were incubated for 6 days under normoxic or hypoxic (5% O 2 ) conditions in the presence of cytokines or growth factors that were differentially expressed in TAM populations ( Table S3 A). The macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry.
The Smart-seq2 data were processed as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Low-quality reads were filtered out when: (1) “N” bases accounting for 10% read length; or (2) bases with quality < 5 account for 50% read length; or (3) containing adaptor sequences. The remaining paired-end reads were aligned to the UCSC hg38 human genome reference using kallisto (version 0.43.1)( Bray et al., 2016 8. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (5208) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters “–bootstrap-samples=100–threads=2.” The R package tximport (version 1.9.12) was used to summarize the transcript-level estimated counts into the matrix of gene-level counts. Low-quality cells were discarded if the cell library size or the number of expressed genes (counts larger than 0) was smaller than pre-defined thresholds, which were the medians of all cells minus 3 × median absolute deviation. Cells were also removed if their proportions of mitochondrial gene expression were larger than 10% (70% for CD45 − cells). In the droplet-based 10× data, the Cell Ranger toolkit (version 2.1.0) provided by 10× Genomics was applied to align reads and generate the gene-cell unique molecular identifier (UMI) matrix, using the reference genome GRCh38 and GRCm38. For each cell, we quantified the number of genes and UMIs, and kept high quality cells with the detection threshold of 600-4,000 genes and 1,600-25,000 UMIs. We used a relatively high threshold to ensure that we have filtered out the most of barcodes associated with empty partitions or doublet cells. Cells with unusually high detection rate of mitochondrial gene expression were also excluded as described above. The following table shows the number of resulting genes and cells for each dataset collected in this study. For human Smart-seq2 dataset, a total of 5,126 single T cells we generated previously ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ) were combined with scRNA-seq data from the same patients in this study.

We used an entropy-based metric to quantify the batch effect across different patients ( Azizi et al., 2018 3. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes with the top 1000 standard deviation were used to map the data to a two-dimensional t-SNE by R package Rtsne (version 0.15). We constructed a k-NN graph (k = 30) based on the Euclidean distance of cells in tSNE coordinates using the R function kNN from dbscan package (version 1.1.2), and defined the mixing of the data across patients as Shannon entropy, 𝐻 𝑗 = − ∑ 𝑇 𝑡 = 1 𝑝 𝑡 𝑗 ⁢ l o g 2 ⁡ 𝑝 𝑡 𝑗 where 𝑝 𝑡 𝑗 is the ratio of the number of cells from patient t in the 30 nearest neighborhood of cell j and ∑ 𝑇 𝑡 = 1 𝑝 𝑡 𝑗 = 1 .
We performed batch correction across different patients in both Smart-seq2 and 10× scRNA-seq data by calculating the batch factor (BF) using the approach in pagoda2 . The batch removed counts ( 𝑅 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ ) was defined as 𝐶 𝑖 , 𝑗 / 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐹 𝑖 , 𝑘 , where 𝐶 𝑖 , 𝑗 was the raw count value (or UMI) of gene i in cell j and 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐹 𝑖 , 𝑘 was the batch factor of gene i in batch k . In Smart-seq2 data, the transcripts per million (TPM) value was calculated by ( ( 1 0 6 × 𝑅 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑗 / 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑖 ) / ( ∑ 𝑅 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑗 / 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑖 ) ) . In 10× data, the expression value was calculated by to create a TPM-like value, and finally computing l o g 2 ⁡ ( 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑀 + 1 ) . The corrected expression matrices were used as the input for further analysis.
We applied Scrublet ( Wolock et al., 2019 70. Wolock, S.L. ∙ Lopez, R. ∙ Klein, A.M. Scrublet: Computational Identification of Cell Doublets in Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :281-291.e289 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (932) PubMed Google Scholar ) in human 10× dataset to identify artifactual libraries generated from two or more cells, where they entered the same microfluidic droplet and were labeled with barcodes. The doublet score for each single cell and the threshold based on the bimodal distribution was calculated using default parameters. We used a cluster-level approach to remove doublet clusters containing large number of potential doublet cells. Specifically, we removed the CD14 + IL32 + cluster with a large fraction of potential monocyte-NK cell doublets, which expressed both monocyte signature genes ( CD14 , S100A8 , S100A9 , S100A12 ) and cytotoxic signature genes ( IL32 , NKG7 , GZMA , GZMB ) (data not shown).
The bulk exome-seq data were cleaned following the same procedure for scRNA-seq data processing. The cleaned high-quality reads were then aligned to human genome according to the BWA-PICARD/GATK-strelka pipeline, and the somatic copy number alterations were obtained by ADTex (version 1.0.4) as we previously described ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The TCR-seq data of mouse anti-CD40 treatment dataset was processed using Cell Ranger (version 2.1.0) against the manufacturer-supplied mouse vdj reference genome. In all TCR contigs assembled, we first discarded the low-confidence, non-productive or those UMIs < 2. For cells with two or more α or β chains assembled, the α–β pair showing the highest expression level (UMI) was defined as the dominant α–β pair in the corresponding cell. If two or more cells had identical dominant α–β pairs, the dominant α–β pair were identified as clonal TCRs, and these T cells were identified as clonal T cells. To integrate TCR results with the gene expression data, the TCR-based analysis was performed only for cells that were identified as T cells. We identified the TCR α–β pairs for 53,499 cells from 33,114 CD4 + T cells and 37,740 CD8 + T cells. The detailed TCR α and β sequences and clonotypes are presented in Table S6 A. Among all T cells, 53,499 CD4 + or CD8 + T cells with TCR information were used to perform the STARTRAC analysis as we previously described ( Zhang et al., 2018 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To cluster single cells by their expression, we used an unsupervised graph-based clustering algorithm implemented in Seurat v2 (version 2.3.0) ( Butler et al., 2018 10. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6227) PubMed Google Scholar ) for each dataset separately. The highly variable genes were generated with appropriate threshold of the mean expression and dispersion (variance/mean). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on about 2000 variable genes. We used the function FindClusters on 10-25 PCs with resolution 0.6-2 to perform the first-round cluster and annotated each cluster by known markers. We identified eight major cell types, including 4 immune cell types (T cells, ILCs, B cells and myeloid cells) and 4 non-immune cell types (epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and malignant cells). Specifically, malignant cell clusters were also characterized by the exceptionally high amounts of expressed genes. The second-round clustering was performed according to the same range of parameters to identify clusters within the major cell types aforementioned. Notably, neutrophils, despite their importance in the tumor microenvironment ( Mantovani et al., 2011 46. Mantovani, A. ∙ Cassatella, M.A. ∙ Costantini, C. ... Neutrophils in the activation and regulation of innate and adaptive immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 :519-531 Crossref Scopus (2218) PubMed Google Scholar ), were not sufficiently captured in either Smart-seq2 or 10× scRNA-seq platform, which was further confirmed by reference component analysis (RCA) ( Li et al., 2017 41. Li, H. ∙ Courtois, E.T. ∙ Sengupta, D. ... Reference component analysis of single-cell transcriptomes elucidates cellular heterogeneity in human colorectal tumors Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :708-718 Crossref Scopus (754) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the expression of neutrophil markers (data not shown). The under-representation of these cells was most likely due to the techniques that were employed to purify cells prior to sorting and the known difficulties in capturing adequate RNA from this cell type ( Schelker et al., 2017; Zilionis et al., 2019 60. Schelker, M. ∙ Feau, S. ∙ Du, J. ... Estimation of immune cell content in tumour tissue using single-cell RNA-seq data Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :2032 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar 80. Zilionis, R. ∙ Engblom, C. ∙ Pfirschke, C. ...

The unsupervised clustering of single cells collected from each mouse model was performed following the same procedures as we did for human scRNA-seq datasets. To further identify the consistent myeloid cell clusters from both mouse datasets, we performed integrative analysis of myeloid cells from these two datasets by Seurat v3 (version 3.1.0) ( Butler et al., 2018 10. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6227) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the standard integration workflow.
For visualization, the dimensionality of each dataset was further reduced using either the Barnes-Hut t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with Seurat functions RunTSNE and RunUMAP . The PCs used to calculate the embedding were as the same as those used for clustering. When calculating the UMAP coordinates, the effective scale of embedded points setting (spread) varied from 1 to 2.
To integrate and embed single cells from human CRC generated by two platforms into a shared low-dimension space ( Figure 1 C), we utilized integrated analysis (CCA) by the Seurat v3 function IntegrateData . Importantly, the new integrated matrix was obtained and was used only for visualization, instead of clustering or any other downstream analyses.
We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the R function aov , and the differences between each cluster pairs were tested using Tukey’s range test implemented in R function TukeyHSD as we previously described ( Guo et al., 2018 25. Guo, X. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Global characterization of T cells in non-small-cell lung cancer by single-cell sequencing Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :978-985 Crossref Scopus (967) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, for each cluster, only genes that met these criteria were considered as DEGs: 1) FDR adjusted P -value of F test < 0.05; 2) any cluster pair showed significant difference in the HSD test (absolute log 2 fold change > 1 and P -value adjusted by Tukey’s ‘Honest Significant Difference’ method < 0.01).
To quantify the cell type enrichment across tissues, we compared the observed and expected cell numbers in each cluster according to the following formula as we described previously ( Guo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018 25. Guo, X. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Global characterization of T cells in non-small-cell lung cancer by single-cell sequencing Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :978-985 Crossref Scopus (967) PubMed Google Scholar 76. Zhang, L. ∙ Yu, X. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Lineage tracking reveals dynamic relationships of T cells in colorectal cancer Nature. 2018; 564 :268-272 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ): 𝑅 𝑜 / 𝑒 = 𝑂 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 where the expected cell numbers for each combination of cell clusters and tissues are obtained from the Chi-square test. We assumed that one cluster was enriched in a specific tissue if 𝑅 𝑜 / 𝑒 >1.
To compare the similarities of clusters from different datasets, we trained a logistic regression model using elastic net regularization ( Young et al., 2018 73. Young, M.D. ∙ Mitchell, T.J. ∙ Vieira Braga, F.A. ... Single-cell transcriptomes from human kidneys reveal the cellular identity of renal tumors Science. 2018; 361 :594-599 Crossref Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ). Before training the model, we downsampled each cluster to the minimum size of all clusters in the training dataset to eliminate possible bias attributed to different sizes of training sets. Specifically, for training datasets containing clusters with cell number lower than 50, the downsampled size of these clusters was set as 50. The R function cv.glmnet from the glmnet package (version 2.0.16) was used to fit a series of n binomial logistic regression models with parameters alpha = 0.99, where n is the number of clusters in the training data. A 10-fold cross validation was performed in each case. The offset for each model was calculated with l o g ⁡ ( 𝑓 / 1 − 𝑓 ) , where f is the fraction of cells in the cluster being trained.
We used these models to calculate a predicted logit of each cell in the test data for each cluster from the training data with an offset of 0. Predicted logits were then averaged within each cluster and converted to probabilities for visualization, which indicated the similarity of clusters from the test data to those from the training data.
When comparing the similarities between myeloid cells collected from human and two mouse datasets ( Figure 3 H), we calculated the predicted logits between human 10× dataset and anti-CD40 mouse dataset and between human 10× dataset and anti-CSF1R dataset separately. Two logits matrices were combined together and then averaged as above.
To distinguish malignant cells from non-malignant cells in human CRC CD45 - cells generated by Smart-seq2, we inferred large-scale chromosomal copy-number variations (CNVs) in each single cell based on a moving averaged expression profiles across chromosomal intervals ( Patel et al., 2014; Puram et al., 2017; Tirosh et al., 2016 52. Patel, A.P. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Trombetta, J.J. ...

We first excluded the genes with low expression levels by the cutoff of l o g 2 ⁡ ( 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ ( 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑀 𝑖 , ) + 1 ) < 3 . 5 and re-quantified the gene expression as 𝐸 𝑖 , 𝑗 = l o g 2 ⁡ ( 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑀 𝑖 , 𝑗 / 1 0 + 1 ) , where 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑀 𝑖 , 𝑗 referred to transcripts per million for gene i in cell j . Then the relative expression levels were centered as 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 = 𝐸 𝑖 , 𝑗 − 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝐸 𝑖 , ) . To avoid considerable impact of any particular gene, we limited the relative expression values to [-3,3] by replacing all values above 3 by 3 and values below −3 by −3. This relative expression matrix was only used for CNV estimation.
Initial CNVs ( CNV i ) were calculated by sorting the analyzed genes by their chromosomal location and applying a moving average to the relative expression values, with a sliding window of 100 genes within each chromosome. The CNV i was further centered cell by cell so that the mean CNV c of a given cell returned to zero. We have identified and annotated CD45 − sub clusters based on the expression of known maker genes, which helped to redefine CNV estimation using the average patterns of non-malignant cells as a reference. We thus defined multiple baselines as the average CNV c of all cells in each non-malignant epithelial cell cluster (hE02-hE06), and the maximal (BaseMax) and minimal (BaseMin) baseline at each gene window across these five clusters. The final CNV estimation CNV f of cell i at position j was defined as: 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑓 ⁡ ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) = ⎧ { ⎨ { ⎩ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) − 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁡ ( 𝑗 ) , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) > 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁡ ( 𝑗 ) + 0 . 2 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) − 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑗 ) , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) < 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑗 ) − 0 . 2 0 , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑗 ) − 0 . 2 < 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) < 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁡ ( 𝑗 ) + 0 . 2
When plotting the heatmap, CNV f were limited to [-1,1] and the values between [-0.1,0.1] were replaced by 0 ( Figure S3 E). To quantitatively distinguish malignant cells from non-malignant cells, we scored each cell with two CNV parameters: (1) CNV score reflected the overall CNV signal, defined as the mean squares of CNV f values across the genome; (2) CNV correlation was the Pearson correlation between CNV f profile of each cell and the average CNV f of all malignant cells identified by unsupervised clustering from the same sample ( Figure S3 F).
Three different algorithms, including RNA velocity, URD and partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA), were used to infer the developmental trajectories of monocytes and macrophages sequenced by 10× Genomics scRNA-seq. When performing the RNA velocity analysis, we first used the R implementation of destiny (version 2.11.3) ( Angerer et al., 2016 1. Angerer, P. ∙ Haghverdi, L. ∙ Büttner, M. ... destiny: diffusion maps for large-scale single-cell data in R Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :1241-1243 Crossref Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a nonlinear dimensionality approach to access the diffusion map of up to 1000 random selected cells in each myeloid cluster (hM05-hM13). The velocyto python package was then used to recount the spliced reads and unspliced reads based on previously aligned bam files, while the velocyto R package was used to calculate RNA velocity values for each gene from each cell and embed RNA velocity vector to the 2-D diffusion map space ( La Manno et al., 2018 36. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1954) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To get a clearer pseudo-temporal ordering of all monocytes and macrophages enriched in tumors (hM08, hM10, hM11, hM12, hM13), another algorithm, URD (version 1.0.1) ( Farrell et al., 2018 20. Farrell, J.A. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Riesenfeld, S.J. ... Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis Science. 2018; 360 :eaar3131 Crossref Scopus (465) PubMed Google Scholar ), was also applied to reconstruct the developmental trajectories into a tree structure ( Figure 2 F). Monocytes from cluster hM05_Mono-CD14 were set as root cells, while cells from cluster hM06_Mono-CD16 were used as control. The analyses were performed based on the following parameters:
knn = 200,sigma = 8,divergence.method = ‘ks’,cells.per.pseudotime.bin = 100,bins.per.pseudotime.window = 10,minimum.visits = 7,p.thresh = 0.001.
The third algorithm, PAGA, was calculated by scanpy ( Wolf et al., 2018 68. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (2985) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the top 2000 highly variable genes and 15 PCs ( Figure S4 E). Based on the calculations of these three algorithms, a model for the developmental trajectories of monocytes and macrophages in CRC was summarized and provided in Figure S4 F.
Gene set variation analysis implemented in the GSVA package (version 1.3.0) was used for gene set enrichment analysis. The gene sets we used were exported using the GSEABase package (version 1.44.0). The differences in pathway activities scored per cell between hM12_TAM-C1QC and hM13_TAM-SPP1 cells ( Figure 3 B) were calculated with LIMMA package (version 3.37.11).
The M1/M2 phenotype of each myeloid cell was defined as the mean expression of gene signatures ( Azizi et al., 2018 3. Azizi, E. ∙ Carr, A.J. ∙ Plitas, G. ... Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment Cell. 2018; 174 :1293-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes associated with “classically activated” (M1) macrophages include CCL5 , CCR7 , CD40 , CD86 , CXCL9, CXCL10 , CXCL11 , IDO1 , IL1A , IL1B , IL6 , IRF1 , IRF5 and KYNU , while CCL4 , CCL13 , CCL18 , CCL20 , CCL22 , CD276 , CLEC7A , CTSA , CTSB , CTSC , CTSD , FN1 , IL4R , IRF4 , LYVE1 , MMP9 , MMP14 , MMP19 , MSR1 , TGFB1 , TGFB2 , TGFB3 , TNFSF8 , TNFSF12 , VEGFA , VEGFB and VEGFC were used to define the signature of “alternatively activated” (M2) macrophages.
The average expression of known proliferation-related genes was defined as the proliferation score ( Whitfield et al., 2006 67. Whitfield, M.L. ∙ George, L.K. ∙ Grant, G.D. ... Common markers of proliferation Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6 :99-106 Crossref Scopus (464) PubMed Google Scholar ). These proliferation genes include AURKA , BUB1 , CCNB1 , CCND1 , CCNE1 , DEK , E2F1 , FEN1 , FOXM1 , H2AFZ , HMGB2 , MCM2 , MCM3 , MCM4 , MCM5 , MCM6 , MKI67 , MYBL2 , PCNA , PLK1 , TOP2A , TYMS and ZWINT .
To compare the myeloid cells from our human CRC dataset with those from UC patients and healthy individuals published previously ( Smillie et al., 2019 61. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730.e722 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ), we fetched the UMIs matrix of all myeloid cells and removed the batch effect across different individuals with bbknn . After re-clustering of the high-quality cells from UC dataset by scanpy ( Figure S4 J), we used the function TransferData from Seurat v3 package to re-classify the myeloid cells from UC dataset based on our CRC 10× dataset. The predicted IDs were obtained and subsequently used to calculate the percentage of cells from UC datasets projected onto different subsets identified in CRC dataset ( Figure S4 K).
For systemic comparison of cDC1 cells across different human individuals and mouse models, we performed hierarchical clustering of cDC1 cells and activated DC cells from our human CRC, mouse MC38, mouse Renca datasets, recently published UC (Single Cell Portal, SCP259) ( Smillie et al., 2019 61. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730.e722 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ), human and mouse non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (GEO, GSE127465 ) ( Zilionis et al., 2019 80. Zilionis, R. ∙ Engblom, C. ∙ Pfirschke, C. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Human and Mouse Lung Cancers Reveals Conserved Myeloid Populations across Individuals and Species Immunity. 2019; 50 :1317-1334.e1310 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (812) PubMed Google Scholar ), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) datasets (EGA, EGAS00001003449) ( Zhang et al., 2019 77. Zhang, Q. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Luo, N. ... Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell. 2019; 179 :829-845.e820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (836) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the expression of signature genes related to immature and mature cDC1 ( Figure S6 I). cDC1 cells were labeled as m DC1/ h DC1 in NSCLC dataset and DC-c3-CLEC9A in HCC dataset, while activated DC cells were labeled as m DC3/ h DC3 in NSCLC dataset and DC-c4-LAMP3 in HCC dataset.
For 40 immune cell subtypes identified in human CRC, we assigned them into tumor or normal-enriched group based on their tissue enrichment scores quantified by Ro/e values ( Ro/e > 1; Figures 2 C and S3 C). Among them, 24 tissue-enriched clusters identified by both Smart-seq2 and 10× Genomics platforms were used in this analysis. To systematically infer the correlative interactions between immune and non-immune cells, we also included three tumor-enriched stromal cell subsets, including fibroblasts (hF01_Myofib-ACTA2 and hF02_CAF-FAP), and endothelial cells (hE01_Endothelium-ACKR1). The specific gene signatures for each subtype were derived from Smart-seq2 dataset based on the following criteria: 1) FDR adjusted P -value of F test < 0.05; 2) any cluster pair showed significant difference in the HSD test (absolute log 2 fold change > 1 and P - value adjusted by Tukey’s ‘Honest Significant Difference’ method < 0.01). 3) AUC > 0.65; 4) typical marker genes described in literatures.
For tumor-enriched clusters, the TCGA COAD and READ data were used to evaluate the abundance of each cluster, while the GTEx colon tissue data were used for normal-enriched clusters. The gene expression from these bulk RNA-seq datasets were downloaded from UCSC Xena ( http://xena.ucsc.edu/ ). Subsequently, we estimated the relative abundance of each cell subtype by the average expression of z-score normalized log-transformed expression of the cell type specific genes defined above. The lists of cell subtype specific genes were provided in Table S4 A.
Given the hypothesis that changes in the abundance of cells in the tissue could be influenced by cell-cell interaction ( Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018; Puram et al., 2017; Tirosh et al., 2016 30. Jerby-Arnon, L. ∙ Shah, P. ∙ Cuoco, M.S. ... A Cancer Cell Program Promotes T Cell Exclusion and Resistance to Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2018; 175 :984-997.e924 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (793) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Puram, S.V. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Parikh, A.S. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Primary and Metastatic Tumor Ecosystems in Head and Neck Cancer Cell. 2017; 171 :1611-1624.e1624 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1478) PubMed Google Scholar 63. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Crossref Scopus (2762) PubMed Google Scholar ), we computed the Pearson correlation coefficient between the expression of each gene and the relative abundance of each cell subtype to identify genes that may infer the presence of cells co-occurring with these particular clusters ( Figure S8 A). Based on the bulk RNA-seq profiles, we obtained a correlation matrix between genes and abundances of cell subtypes. Since the expression levels of certain signature genes in a given cell subtype were highly correlated with the abundance of this specific cell subtype, we defined these genes as “self-expressed genes” based on our Smart-seq2 dataset according to the following criteria: (1) average expression > 1; (2) cell frequency of expression > 20%. We then filtered these genes and transformed their correlation values to 0 to obtain an adjusted correlation matrix ( Figure S8 A).
For a specific cell subtype, to identify which cell subtypes could contribute to the highly correlated non-self-expressed genes, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis based on our Smart-seq2 dataset. In detail, we calculated the mean expression of each gene across each tumor or normal-enriched cell subtype and then performed z-score transformation. Next, the top 13 highly correlated non-self-expressed genes were selected from the adjusted correlation matrix. We then calculated the mean value of z-score transformed expression of these genes in each cell subtype as the enrichment score. Finally, the correlated cell subtype(s) was identified as the z-score transformed enrichment score > 1.96 ( Figure S8 A). The correlative networks in tumor and normal mucosa were built separately with corresponding correlated cell subtypes ( Figures 3 E and S5 C).
To identify significant ligand-receptor pairs in human CRC using the Smart-seq2 data, we first downloaded the ligand-receptor (LR) pairs from published databases ( Ramilowski et al., 2015; Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 55. Ramilowski, J.A. ∙ Goldberg, T. ∙ Harshbarger, J. ... A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signalling in human Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7866 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Vento-Tormo, R. ∙ Efremova, M. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal-fetal interface in humans Nature. 2018; 563 :347-353 Crossref Scopus (1309) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then defined a ligand or receptor as an “expressed” gene in a certain cell type if more than 20% cells had its expression level by the cutoff of log2(TPM+1)>3, and we set the expression value of unexpressed ligand/receptor to zero. We scored a given LR pair interaction between cell type A and cell type B as the product of average ligand expression across all cells in cell type A and the average receptor expression across all cells in cell type B using the following formula, 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝐴 → 𝐵 𝐿 𝑖 → 𝑅 𝑖 = 𝐸 𝐴 𝐿 𝑖 × 𝐸 𝐵 𝑅 𝑖 Statistical significance was then assessed by randomly shuffling the cluster labels of all cells and repeating the above steps, which generated a null distribution for each LR pair in each pairwise comparison between two cell types. After running 1,000 times permutations, P -values were calculated with the normal distribution curve generated from the permuted LR pair interaction scores.
The TCGA COAD and READ data were used to evaluate the prognostic performance of individual genes or gene sets derived from specific cell clusters. The gene expression data and the clinical data were downloaded from UCSC Xena ( http://xena.ucsc.edu/ ). The mean expression of given signatures was grouped into high and low expression groups by the 55 th and 45 th quantile values. We used the Cox proportional hazards model implemented in the R package survival to correct tumor stage and MSI-state for survival analyses and plotted Kaplan-Meier survival curves using R function ggsurvplot .
