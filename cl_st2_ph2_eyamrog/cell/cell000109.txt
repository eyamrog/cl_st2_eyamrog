Title: Genomic History of Neolithic to Bronze Age Anatolia, Northern Levant, and Southern Caucasus


Abstract: Summary

Here, we report genome-wide data analyses from 110 ancient Near Eastern individuals spanning the Late Neolithic to Late Bronze Age, a period characterized by intense interregional interactions for the Near East. We find that 6 th millennium BCE populations of North/Central Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus shared mixed ancestry on a genetic cline that formed during the Neolithic between Western Anatolia and regions in today’s Southern Caucasus/Zagros. During the Late Chalcolithic and/or the Early Bronze Age, more than half of the Northern Levantine gene pool was replaced, while in the rest of Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus, we document genetic continuity with only transient gene flow. Additionally, we reveal a genetically distinct individual within the Late Bronze Age Northern Levant. Overall, our study uncovers multiple scales of population dynamics through time, from extensive admixture during the Neolithic period to long-distance mobility within the globalized societies of the Late Bronze Age.

Section: Introduction

Since the beginnings of agriculture, the Near East has been an influential region in the formation of complex and early state-level societies and has drawn considerable research interest in archaeology since the 19 th century ( Killebrew and Steiner, 2014; McMahon and Steadman, 2012 89.

The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia (10,000–323 BCE) Oxford University Press, 2012 Google Scholar ). Developments in the field of ancient DNA (aDNA) over the last decade have shed light onto questions related to the process of Neolithization. Near Eastern farmers from South-Central Anatolia, the Southern Levant, and Northwestern Iran were descended from local foragers, and the transition from foraging to farming in these areas was shown to have been a biologically continuous process with only minor gene flow among them ( Broushaki et al., 2016; Feldman et al., 2019; Lazaridis et al., 2016 32.

Almost two millennia later, this situation had changed. In contrast to these Early Holocene populations, Chalcolithic/Eneolithic and Bronze Age populations from Western and Central Anatolia, the Southern Levant, Iran (Zagros), and the Caucasus show less genetic differentiation from each other, suggesting that these later periods were characterized by an extensive process of gene flow spanning a large area ( Allentoft et al., 2015; de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018; Haber et al., 2017; Harney et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2015; Lazaridis et al., 2016, 2017; Wang et al., 2019 18.

Commun. 2019; 10 :590 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the spatiotemporal scope of this process is poorly understood because of the lack of ancient genomes from areas that bridge these distant regions (i.e., Central and Eastern Anatolia) that, in turn, requires denser sampling. To date, the spatial distribution of features attributed to the “Neolithic package” across Anatolia suggests a heterogeneous multiple-event process that correlates with broader geographical zones ( Özdoğan, 2014 155. Özdoğan, M. A new look at the introduction of the Neolithic way of life in Southeastern Europe. Changing paradigms of the expansion of the Neolithic way of life Documenta Praehistorica. 2014; 41 :33 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). However, whether population movement played a prominent role in the formation of these zones within Anatolia remains an open question.
Throughout Western Asia, archaeological evidence for the movement of peoples, material, and/or ideas is well documented ( Figure 1 ). In the Southern Caucasus, archaeological research indicates relations with Northern Mesopotamia during the Late Neolithic (Halaf and Samarra cultures) ( Badalyan et al., 2010; Nishiaki et al., 2015 19. Badalyan, R. ∙ Harutyunyan, A. ∙ Chataigner, C. ...

Archaeol. 2015; 119 :279-294 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar ), and in Eastern Anatolia, a network of cultural connections marked by several expansive events, mostly related to the Mesopotamian world, is attested. These include an early intrusion of the South Mesopotamian Ubaid culture into Upper Mesopotamia as far as the Taurus mountains of Southeastern Anatolia during the 5 th millennium BCE ( Frangipane, 2015a; Carter and Philip, 2010 39.

Different types of multiethnic societies and different patterns of development and change in the prehistoric Near East Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :9182-9189 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was followed, in the Southern Caucasus, by a strong influence at this time from Upper Mesopotamia during the late 5 th –mid 4 th millennium ( Lyonnet, 2007; Lyonnet, 2012 104. Lyonnet, B. La culture de Maikop, la Transcaucasie, l’Anatolie orientale et le Proche-Orient: relations et chronologie Lyonnet, B. (Editor) Les cultures du Caucase (VIe- IIIe millénaires av. n.è.).

From the middle to the end of the 4 th millennium, another Southern Mesopotamian influence (the so-called “Middle and Late Uruk expansion”) reached Upper Mesopotamia and the upper stretches of the Euphrates and Tigris river valleys in Eastern Anatolia ( Allen and Rothman, 2004 17. Allen, M. ∙ Rothman, M. Uruk, Mesopotamia & Its Neighbors: Cross-Cultural Interactions in the Era of State Formation American Antiquity. 2004; 69 :152 Crossref Google Scholar ). At the same time, during the second half of the 4 th millennium BCE, the Kura-Araxes culture, which is generally thought to originate in the Southern Caucasus, expanded outward around 3000–2900 BCE, spreading westward to Eastern Anatolia and the Northern and Southern Levant ( Palumbi, 2017; Palumbi and Chataigner, 2014 157.

Palumbi, G. ∙ Chataigner, C. The Kura-Araxes Culture from the Caucasus to Iran, Anatolia and the Levant: Between unity and diversity. A synthesis Paéorient. 2014; 40 :247-260 Google Scholar ) and eastward to Iran ( Rothman, 2011 181. Rothman, M. Migration and Resettlement: Godin Period IV Gopnik, H. ∙ Rothman, M. (Editors) On the High Road Mazda Publishers/ROM, 2011 Google Scholar ). Evidence of these events comes from numerous excavations and is especially apparent in the long and extensively excavated sequence of occupations at Arslantepe in the Malatya plain of Eastern Anatolia. In the Northern Levant, material connections with Northern Mesopotamia start appearing in the 4 th millennium BCE and have been attributed to either extensive cultural contacts or population movements.
The major question is, therefore: what was moving? Was this a movement of populations, material culture, ideas, or some combination? These earlier developments lead to the increasing “globalization” in the Eastern Mediterranean basin from the Middle Bronze Age (MBA) onward, which is characterized by an intensification of resource exploitation and management through connected sea and land routes ( Akar, 2013; Feldman, 2006; Hodos, 2017 1. Akar, M. The Late Bronze Age Fortresses at Alalakh: Architecture and Identity in Meditteranean Exchange Systems Yener, K.A. (Editor) Across the Border: Late Bronze-Iron Age relations between Syria and Anatolia. Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the Research Center of Anatolian Studies, Koc University, Istanbul, May 31–June 1, 2010 Peeters, 2013 Google Scholar 53. Feldman, M.H. Diplomacy by Design The University of Chicago Press, 2006 Google Scholar 74. Hodos, T. (Editor) The Routledge Handbook of Archaeology and Globalization Routledge, 2017 Google Scholar ). However, the role of human mobility is unclear and a challenging question to address due to the scarcity of Middle and Late Bronze Age (LBA) burials. In this regard, the site of Alalakh in the Amuq Valley (Turkey), with more than 300 burials dated to that period, represents an exceptional case for the application of aDNA studies.
Understanding the nature of this movement was the primary motivation behind this study. Here, we present a large-scale analysis of genome-wide data from key sites of prehistoric Anatolia, the Northern Levant, and the Southern Caucasian lowlands. Our goal was to reconstruct the genomic history of this part of the Near East by systematically sampling across this transition from the Neolithic to the interconnected societies of the MBA and LBA. Our new ancient genome-wide dataset consists of 110 individuals and encompasses four regional time transects in Central/North Anatolia, East Anatolia, the Southern Caucasian lowlands, and the Northern Levant, each spanning 2,000 to 4,000 years of Near Eastern prehistory. We find that mid-6 th millennium populations from North/Central Anatolia and the Southern Caucasian lowlands were closely connected; they formed a genetic gradient (cline) that runs from Western Anatolia to the Southern Caucasus and Zagros in today’s Northern Iran. This cline formed after an admixture event that biologically connected these two regions ca. 6500 BCE. Chalcolithic and Bronze Age populations across Anatolia also mostly descended from this genetic gradient. In the Northern Levant, by contrast, we identified a major genetic shift between the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age periods. During this transition, Northern Levantine populations experienced gene flow from new groups harboring ancestries related to both Zagros/Caucasus and the Southern Levant. This suggests a shift in social orientation, perhaps in response to the rise of urban centers in Mesopotamia, which to date remain genetically unsampled.

Section: Results

We report genome-wide data from a targeted set of ∼1.24 million ancestry-informative SNPs for 110 individuals from Anatolia, the Northern Levant, and the Southern Caucasian lowlands spanning ∼4,000 years of prehistory. Nine of these individuals date to Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic (“LN/EC”; 6 th millennium BCE) and come from three different geographic sectors: the Central/Northern Anatolian Boğazköy-Büyükkaya, the Amuq Valley in Southern Anatolia/Northern Levant (Tell Kurdu), and the Southern Caucasian lowlands (Mentesh Tepe and Polutepe) ( Figure 2 A). The remaining 101 individuals date from the Late Chalcolithic to the Late Bronze Age (“LC-LBA”; 4 th –2 nd millennia BCE) and were collected from the following archaeological sites: Alalakh (modern Tell Atchana), Alkhantepe, Arslantepe, Ebla (modern Tell Mardikh), Çamlıbel Tarlası, İkiztepe, and Titriş Höyük ( Figure 2 A).
For in-depth population genetic analyses, we excluded a total of 16 individuals that did not meet quality requirements (e.g., SNP coverage, absence of damage patterns, contamination). All the remaining individuals showed damage patterns expected for ancient samples and had low contamination estimates (≤5% for all but one, which has 10%). Overall, we performed genetic analyses on genome-wide data from 94 individuals, and 77 of these were accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dated ( Figure 2 B; Table S1 ). We grouped the individuals by archaeological site or area and archaeological period applying a nomenclature scheme that preserves this information ( Figure 2 C; STAR Methods ). We also identified seven cases of 1 st or 2 nd degree relative pairs ( Figure S1 ; Table S2 ) and restricted group-based genetic analyses for these groups ( f -statistics, qpWave/qpAdm , and DATES) to 89 unrelated (≥3 rd degree) individuals ( Figure 2 C).
We merged our dataset with genetic data from ca. 800 previously published ancient individuals ( Table S3 ; STAR Methods ). Among these, 17 Anatolian individuals from the following archaeological sites overlap with our time transect and were co-analyzed with the Anatolian groups from our study: Tepecik-Çiftlik ( Kılınç et al., 2016 88.

So far, our knowledge of the gene pool of Neolithic Anatolia has been limited to individuals from Barcın and Menteşe in Western Anatolia (abbreviated here as “Barcın_N”) ( Mathieson et al., 2015 117. Mathieson, I. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Rohland, N. ...

Feldman, M. ∙ Fernández-Domínguez, E. ∙ Reynolds, L. ... Late Pleistocene human genome suggests a local origin for the first farmers of central Anatolia Nat.

Biol. 2016; 26 :2659-2666 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Tepecik-Çiftlik in Southern Anatolia ( Kılınç et al., 2016 88. Kılınç, G.M. ∙ Omrak, A. ∙ Özer, F. ... The Demographic Development of the First Farmers in Anatolia Curr. Biol. 2016; 26 :2659-2666 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). These individuals date from the 9 th to the 7 th millennium BCE and are succeeded by LN/EC individuals of this study. To overview the genetic structure in this Near Eastern region from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, we first performed principal-component analysis (PCA) ( Patterson et al., 2006; Price et al., 2006 160. Patterson, N. ∙ Price, A.L. ∙ Reich, D. Population structure and eigenanalysis PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e190 Crossref Scopus (2351) PubMed Google Scholar 171. Price, A.L. ∙ Patterson, N.J. ∙ Plenge, R.M. ... Principal components analysis corrects for stratification in genome-wide association studies Nat. Genet. 2006; 38 :904-909 Crossref Scopus (5796) PubMed Google Scholar ) of present-day West Eurasians populations and projected ancient individuals onto the top PCs ( Figure 3 A). Overall, LN/EC individuals are scattered along PC2 between Barcın_N and ancient individuals from Iran/Caucasus ( Figure 3 B). TellKurdu_EC are slightly shifted along PC1 toward Neolithic and Chalcolithic Levantine individuals. Büyükkaya_EC is positioned further away from any Neolithic Anatolian reported to date and toward the direction of Neolithic and Chalcolithic Iranian individuals. Caucasus_lowlands_LN (two individuals from Polutepe and Mentesh Tepe) are positioned upward along PC2, between Büyükkaya_EC and Chalcolithic Iran.
To formally test the qualitative differences observed in PCA, we compared the genetic affinity of LN/EC groups to earlier populations in Western Eurasia by computing f 4 -statistics ( Patterson et al., 2012 161. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ) of the form f 4 ( Mbuti , p2 ; p3 , X ) ( Figure 4 ). The statistic deviates from zero if a pair of Anatolian/Levantine/Caucasian groups ( p3 and X ) differ from each other in their genetic affinities to Epipaleolithic and Neolithic populations ( p2 ). We observe that Büyükkaya_EC and Caucasus_lowlands_LN differ from Barcın_N by sharing more alleles with Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHG; Satsurblia and Kotias Klde caves) and Iran_N (Ganj Dareh site in Zagros mountains) than with Barcın_N (+2.2 to +5.5 SE), while sharing less alleles with hunter-gatherers from Western Europe (WHG) (≤−4.3 SE), Early European Farmers (EEF) (≤−3.6 SE), the Epipaleolithic Pınarbaşı individual from Anatolia (≤−6.8 SE), and with the Neolithic/Epipaleolithic Levant (−1.3 to −9.4 SE). By summarizing the f 4 -statistics using qpAdm ( Haak et al., 2015 69. Haak, W. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe Nature. 2015; 522 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ), we can adequately model both Büyükkaya_EC and Caucasus_lowlands_LN as a two-way mixture of Barcın_N and Iran_N as source populations (p ≥ 0.083; 24%–31% from Iran_N; Figure 4 ). Tepecik_N, which occupies an intermediate position between Barcın_N and Büyükkaya_EC in the PCA, also fits the same model (p = 0.975; 22% from Iran_N). By replacing Iran_N with CHG, we still obtain a good model fit for Büyükkaya_EC (p ≥ 0.825; 24% from CHG), but not for Caucasus_lowlands_LN (p = 0.0001).
Consistent with their positions on the PCA plot, TellKurdu_EC does not fall on this cline of mixed Barcin_N-Iran_N ancestries but shows extra affinity with ancient Levantine populations. Accordingly, f 4 -statistics of the form f 4 ( Mbuti , Levant _ N ; X , TellKurdu _ EC ) ≥3.3 SE, show that TellKurdu_EC has more affinity with the pre-pottery Neolithic Levantines (“Levant_N”) than with any other Neolithic-Early Chalcolithic (“N-EC”) Anatolian population including an almost 1,000-year younger individual from the same area (TellKurdu_MC). When compared to Barcın_N, TellKurdu_EC has significantly (<−4 SE) less affinity with Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Western, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (WHG, EHG, and Iron_Gates, respectively). The admixture model with Barcın_N+Iran_N/CHG used above is not supported for TellKurdu_EC (p < 1.47 × 10 −5 ). Instead, we can successfully model TellKurdu_EC as a three-way mixture of Barcın_N, Iran_N (or CHG), and Levant_N (p = 0.298; 15.5% ± 3.7% from Iran_N and 36.6% ± 7.1% from Levant_N; Figure 4 ).
In contrast to the LN/EC individuals, LC-LBA individuals form a dense cloud in the West Eurasian PCA, roughly falling mid-way along the LN-EC cline that is delimited by ancient groups from Iran, the Caucasus, the Levant and Western Anatolia. We hypothesize that LC-LBA groups from Central/North and Eastern Anatolia may have descended from this older genetic structure and therefore share the same ancestry profile.
Consistent with PCA, outgroup- f 3 and f 4 -statistics suggest a common genetic profile of the LC-LBA groups that is similar to that of the LN-EC cline. First, outgroup f 3 ( Mbuti ; LC-LBA , Test ), which measures the average shared genetic drift between LC-LBA and Test from their common outgroup Mbuti ( Patterson et al., 2012 161. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ), reached highest values when Test were Neolithic and Chalcolithic populations from Europe, Anatolia, and Northern Levant, such as Barcın_N, TellKurdu_EC, and Büyükkaya_EC ( Table S4 ). Second, using Barcın_N and additionally TellKurdu_EC as local baselines, we computed f 4 ( Mbuti , Test ; Barcın _ N / TellKurdu _ EC , X ) to characterize the difference between Barcın_N or TellKurdu_EC and the LC-LBA groups ( X) with respect to a set of ancient Test populations from West Eurasia ( Table S5 ). Iran Neolithic and/or CHG consistently show excess affinity to LC-LBA when compared to TellKurdu_EC and Barcın_N. The Chalcolithic and Bronze Age populations from Iran (Iran_C from the Seh Gabi site) and the Caucasus ( Allentoft et al., 2015; Lazaridis et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019 18. Allentoft, M.E. ∙ Sikora, M. ∙ Sjögren, K.G. ... Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia Nature. 2015; 522 :167-172 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar 98. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Nadel, D. ∙ Rollefson, G. ... Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East Nature. 2016; 536 :419-424 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 212. Wang, C.C. ∙ Reinhold, S. ∙ Kalmykov, A. ... Ancient human genome-wide data from a 3000-year interval in the Caucasus corresponds with eco-geographic regions Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :590 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar )—temporally closer to LC-LBA and located between Iran_N/CHG and LC-LBA in the PCA—also occasionally only share more alleles with some of the LC-LBA groups when compared to Barcın.
We further explored the temporal aspect of the shared admixed profile of LC-LBA groups by estimating their admixture dates using the recently developed method, DATES (M. Chintalapati, N. Patterson, N. Alex, and P. Moorjani, personal communication) ( STAR Methods ). As we previously described, the LN-EC cline as varying proportions of Barcın_N and Iran_N/CHG ancestries, we selected both as source populations. However, given the small sample size of both Iran_N and CHG and the large number of missing SNPs in Iran_N, we also considered modern Caucasians (Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Abkhazians, and Ingushians) as proxies of the second source population.
We focused on the three Late Chalcolithic groups with sufficiently large sample size and who are the earliest in time among the LC-LBA groups: ÇamlıbelTarlası_LC (n = 9), İkiztepe_LC (n = 11), and Arslantepe_LC (n = 17). Taking individual estimates from all these individuals together (“Anatolia_LC”), we obtain a robust admixture date estimate of 105 ± 19 generations ago when we use Barcın_N and modern Caucasians as proxies of the source gene pools ( Figure 5 A). Using a generation time of 28 years ( Moorjani et al., 2016 144. Moorjani, P. ∙ Sankararaman, S. ∙ Fu, Q. ... A genetic method for dating ancient genomes provides a direct estimate of human generation interval in the last 45,000 years Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :5652-5657 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), this estimate equates to an admixture event ∼3,000 years before the time of the LC-LBA individuals, corresponding to ∼6500 years BCE ( Figure 5 B). We observe similar but noisier estimates from individual groups ÇamlıbelTarlası_LC, İkiztepe_LC, and Arslantepe_LC. Admixture dates estimated by two alternative methods, ALDER and rolloffp ( STAR Methods ), overall matched our estimates with DATES ( Figure S2 ).
Encouraged by these results, we extended the analysis to other ancient populations that are on the Early Chalcolithic cline, including Caucasus_lowlands_LN and Büyükkaya_EC, published Early Bronze Age (EBA) individuals from the Caucasus (cluster a) ( Wang et al., 2019; Lazaridis et al., 2016 98. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Nadel, D. ∙ Rollefson, G. ... Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East Nature. 2016; 536 :419-424 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 212. Wang, C.C. ∙ Reinhold, S. ∙ Kalmykov, A. ... Ancient human genome-wide data from a 3000-year interval in the Caucasus corresponds with eco-geographic regions Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :590 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see Table S3 for group labels), as well as Iran_C. For the Caucasus EBA individuals (“Caucasus_a_EBA”), dated to ∼3,100 years BCE, which is similar to the Late Chalcolithic Anatolian individuals, we obtain a similar admixture date of 121 ± 35 generations. Importantly, the earlier two Caucasus_lowlands_LN and the one Büyükkaya_EC individuals yielded more recent admixture dates of 34 ± 15 generations before the age of the individuals (∼5600 years BCE) ( Figure 5 A). The converted calendar date of ∼6500 years BCE matches the timing of the admixture event estimated from the Late Chalcolithic individuals ( Figure 5 B).
Although we showed that it requires both Barcın_N and Iran_N-related ancestries to explain the ancestry composition of the LC-LBA groups, alternative combinations of ancient populations, which may be temporally and spatially more proximal to the LC-LBA groups, may also provide equally fitting models. To obtain a plausible admixture model that more likely reflects the true demographic history, it is crucial to precisely distinguish between closely related candidate source populations. We used qpAdm to model all LC-LBA groups as a mixture of two sources, one related to the Neolithic Anatolian ancestry and the other related to Iran and the Caucasus populations ( Tables S6 and S7 ). For the former, we used three Neolithic or Early Chalcolithic groups (Barcın_N/TellKurdu_EC/Büyükkaya_EC). For the latter, we used Iran_N and CHG, as well as more recent Chalcolithic and Bronze Age populations from the same region ( Allentoft et al., 2015; Lazaridis et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019 18. Allentoft, M.E. ∙ Sikora, M. ∙ Sjögren, K.G. ... Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia Nature. 2015; 522 :167-172 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar 98. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Nadel, D. ∙ Rollefson, G. ... Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East Nature. 2016; 536 :419-424 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 212. Wang, C.C. ∙ Reinhold, S. ∙ Kalmykov, A. ... Ancient human genome-wide data from a 3000-year interval in the Caucasus corresponds with eco-geographic regions Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :590 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the admixture signal in LC-LBA is older than these later populations, we nonetheless used them as a proxy because they might represent a gene pool that is not yet sampled but had contributed to LC-LBA individuals.
We find that Barcın_N+Iran_N adequately explain many LC-LBA groups, but it fails for Alalakh_MLBA, Ebla_EMBA, Arslantepe_LC, Barcın_C, and Caucasus_lowlands_LC (p < 0.05). Iran_N-related contribution varies from 21% ± 9% to 38% ± 6% ( Figure 6 A). The alternative model of Barcın_N+CHG provides slightly higher estimates for CHG-related contribution from 27% ± 13% to 41% ± 7%, although most groups (8/12) cannot be modeled with CHG. For the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age groups, Iran_C provides similar results with Iran_N but with a higher contribution (34%–53%; p ≥ 0.05 for 8/12 groups). Iran_C itself can be modeled as a mixture of Iran_N and Barcın_N (p = 0.365; 37% ± 3% from Barcın_N), which corresponds well with the modeling results for LC-LBA. In contrast, those from the Caucasus, specifically the Eneolithic to Bronze Age (_En/BA) groups, mostly fail to fit LC-LBA.
We repeated our admixture modeling by replacing Barcın_N with TellKurdu_EC. Models with TellKurdu_EC in general provide a good fit to the LC-LBA groups, although we caution that it may be an artifact of reduced statistical power for detecting discrepancies between the model and the actual target groups, due to the much smaller sample size of TellKurdu_EC (n = 5) compared to Barcın_N (n = 22). While models with ancient Iranian populations fail for multiple LC-LBA groups (p < 0.05 for 5/12 with Iran_N and for 3/12 with Iran_C), TellKurdu_EC+CHG can model all LC-LBA groups with varying level of CHG contribution ranging from 13% ± 19% to 40% ± 9%, except for Barcın_C. Replacing CHG with a later Caucasus group (“G.Caucasus_a_En”) provides the same pattern with a higher Caucasus-related contribution (40%–67%; p ≥ 0.05, also with the exception of Barcın_C). When we repeated the analysis after adding Barcın_N to the outgroup set, most results remained similar. However, two LC-LBA groups from the same region with TellKurdu_EC (i.e., Ebla_EMBA and Alalakh_MLBA) became deviant from the model (p < 0.03), suggesting that TellKurdu_EC may not be a good local proxy in a simple two-way admixture model. Therefore, it seems to hold that ancient Iranian groups overall serve as a better proxy than the Caucasus groups, although higher resolution data are necessary to compare them further.
Büyükkaya_EC is the earliest individual in our dataset with a genetic profile similar to the LC-LBA groups within Anatolia. Therefore, we also tested a scenario in which the later LC-LBA groups had descended from the same gene pool without further external contribution. f4 ( Mbuti , X ; Büyükkaya_EC , LC-LBA ) suggests that Büyükkaya_EC shares more alleles with the European/Anatolian Farmers (e.g., Boncucklu, LBK, Barcın_N) than LC-LBA groups do ( Table S5 ). Likewise, most LC-LBA groups cannot be modeled in qpAdm as a sister group with Büyükkaya_EC when Barcın_N is included in the outgroups (p < 0.05 for 1-way model for 11/12). Most LC-LBA groups are adequately modeled by adding the second ancestry of ancient Iran/Caucasus populations, while Alalakh_MLBA and Ebla_EMBA require a substantial contribution from ancient southern Levantine populations ( Figure 6 B).
Overall, the inference of the same admixture date drawn from both Late Neolithic and Late Chalcolithic populations combined with the qpAdm analyses suggest that the LC-LBA populations also derived from the Neolithic genetic cline but were substantially more homogenized than their predecessors ( Figure 6 A). Although the ancient groups from Iran are a better proxy for the eastern source than those from the Caucasus, we caution a naive literal interpretation of our results, as yet unsampled proxies from within Mesopotamia may represent true historical sources of this Iran/Caucasus-related ancestry.
The Northern Levant, represented by the sites Tell Kurdu, Ebla, and Alalakh, showcases the most noticeable genetic turnover among our four time transects. Within two millennia after the last Middle Chalcolithic Tell Kurdu individual (TellKurdu_MC), the genetic profile of the populations in and around the Amuq valley (Alalakh_MLBA and Ebla_EMBA) changed to largely resemble contemporaneous Anatolians. However, the qpAdm modeling with Büyükkaya_EC suggests that Alalakh_MLBA and Ebla_EMBA are still distinct from the other Anatolian groups with respect to their connection to the ancient Southern Levant. Their distinction is also captured by f 4 -statistics whereby Ebla_EMBA and Alalakh_MLBA differ from the other LC-LBA groups with respect to their relation with older populations such as Barcin_N and Caucasian groups ( Figure S3 ). In addition, Barcin_N/TellKurdu_EC and/or ancient Caucasian groups cannot successfully model Ebla_EMBA and Alalakh_MLBA in qpAdm ( Tables S6 and S7 ), suggesting that these sources do not represent good proxies of their true ancestries. Alternative models with the predecessor TellKurdu_EC as a baseline ancestry and the geographically close Arslantepe_LC as a potential proximal source did not improve the fit either (p ≤ 1.3 × 10 −5 ; Table S8 ). However, admixture models become adequate by adding a southern Levantine population as the third source, with significant Levantine contributions: e.g., 27%–34% TellKurdu_EC + 36%–38% G.Caucasus_a_En + 28%–38% Levant_EBA (p ≥ 0.492).
Consistent with the extra gene flow after the time of TellKurdu_EC, we obtain younger admixture dates in Alalakh_MLBA than the other LC-LBA groups when we use either Anatolian or Caucasian gene pools as sources: 78 ± 27 generations (3880 ± 746 years BCE) with Anatolia_LC and 44 ± 8 (3060 ± 224 years BCE) with Caucasus_a_EBA. No exponential decay could be fitted when we used either Anatolia_LC or Caucasus_a_EBA as one source and Levant_C as a second.
All genetic analyses of Alalakh_MLBA were conducted at the exclusion of one female (ALA019) because of her outlier position in the PCA ( Figure 3 B). Discovered at the bottom of a well, the archaeological and anthropological context suggest that the skeletal remains of this woman, C14-dated to 1568–1511 cal BCE (AMS; 2-sigma), represent an irregular burial with evidence of several healed skeletal traumata ( Figure 7 ; STAR Methods ). We have ruled out the possibility of modern-day contamination based on the characteristic aDNA damage profile, low mitochondrial contamination and reproduction of the PCA coordinates after discarding all sequence reads without damage ( STAR Methods ). In the Eurasian PCA ( Figure S4 ), ALA019 falls genetically closer to Chalcolithic and Bronze Age individuals from ancient Iran and Turan (present-day area of Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan) ( Narasimhan et al., 2019 146. Narasimhan, V.M. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ... The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia Science. 2019; 365 :eaat7487 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). These populations represent a west-east genetic cline with varying proportions of ancestries related to Barcın_N, Iran_N and WSHG (hunter gatherers from Western Siberia). We confirmed the genetic affinity of ALA019 observed in the PCA with an outgroup-f 3 test ( Figure 7 A). Other ancient populations from the Caucasus and the Western steppe also produced high affinity but f 4 ( Mbuti , X ; Turan x , ALA019 ) suggest that ALA019 differs from other Turan individuals by occasionally sharing more or less alleles with either Iran_N or WSHG ( Figure 7 B), which agrees with the presence of a genetic cline in this area. In the absence of ancient genomes from nearby regions such as Southern Mesopotamia, the most likely ancestral origin of this individual was somewhere in Eastern Iran or Central Asia.

Section: Discussion

Our study covers time transects of ∼4,000 years of Syro-Anatolian and ∼2,000 years of Southern Caucasian history, both starting from the 6 th millennium BCE. In addition, our admixture date estimates allow us to infer a millennium further back in time to the Neolithic period. We describe a Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic (6 th millennium BCE) genetic cline stretching from Western Anatolia (i.e., area around the Sea of Marmara) to the lowlands of the Southern Caucasus that was formed by an admixture process that started at the beginning of Late Neolithic (∼6500 years BCE). The eastern end of this cline extends beyond the Zagros mountains with minute proportions of Anatolian (i.e., Western Anatolian-like) ancestry reaching as far as Chalcolithic and Bronze Age Central Asia ( Narasimhan et al., 2019 146. Narasimhan, V.M. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ... The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia Science. 2019; 365 :eaat7487 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). To the south, Anatolian ancestry is present in the Southern Levantine Neolithic populations ( Lazaridis et al., 2016 98. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Nadel, D. ∙ Rollefson, G. ... Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East Nature. 2016; 536 :419-424 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and to the north, in the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age populations from the Caucasus (mainly mountainous area) ( Allentoft et al., 2015; Lazaridis et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019 18. Allentoft, M.E. ∙ Sikora, M. ∙ Sjögren, K.G. ... Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia Nature. 2015; 522 :167-172 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar 98. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Nadel, D. ∙ Rollefson, G. ... Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East Nature. 2016; 536 :419-424 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 212.

Commun. 2019; 10 :590 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), most likely as a result of the Late Neolithic admixture.
Evidence for genetic homogenization across larger geographic distances also comes from the uniparentally inherited Y chromosome lineages ( Table S9 ). We observe the most common male lineages J1a, J2a, J2b, and G2a in all spatiotemporal groups of the region. Alongside the less frequent lineages H2 and T1a, these all form part of the genetic legacy that dates to the Neolithic or was already present in the region during the Upper Paleolithic ( Wang et al., 2019; Lazaridis et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2015; Feldman et al., 2019; Broushaki et al., 2016 32.

Ancient human genome-wide data from a 3000-year interval in the Caucasus corresponds with eco-geographic regions Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :590 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). A few notable exceptions provide rather anecdotal but nonetheless important evidence for long distance mobility and extended Y-haplogroup diversity. For example, individual ART038 carries Y-haplotype R1b-V1636 (R1b1a2), which is a rare clade related to other early R1b-lineages, such as R1b-V88 that was found in low frequency in Neolithic Europe (e.g., Haak et al., 2015 69. Haak, W. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe Nature. 2015; 522 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ) and R1b-Z2103—the main Y-lineage that is associated with the spread of “steppe ancestry” across West Eurasia during the early Bronze Age. However, R1b-V1636 and R1b-Z2103 lineages split long before (∼17 kya) and therefore there is no direct evidence for an early incursion from the Pontic steppe during the main era of Arslantepe. Lineage L2-L595 found in ALA084 (Alalakh) has previously been reported in one individual from Chalcolithic Northern Iran ( Narasimhan et al., 2019 146. Narasimhan, V.M. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ... The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia Science. 2019; 365 :eaat7487 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in three males from the Late Maykop phase in the North Caucasus ( Wang et al., 2019 212. Wang, C.C. ∙ Reinhold, S. ∙ Kalmykov, A. ... Ancient human genome-wide data from a 3000-year interval in the Caucasus corresponds with eco-geographic regions Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :590 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). These three share ancestry from the common Anatolian/Iranian ancestry cline described here, which indicates a widespread distribution that also reached the southern margins of the steppe zone north of the Caucasus mountain range.
Dating the formation of the west-to-east cline during the 7 th millennium BCE enables the contextualization of these genetic signals observed on both autosomal and uniparental markers with archaeological evidence of human mobility and changes in socio-cultural practices. The time around 6500–6400 years BCE marks a significant junction in the Anatolian Neolithic because it saw a sudden and massive expansion of sedentary communities into areas that had previously supported no or very few food-producing communities before ( Brami, 2015; Düring, 2013 29. Brami, M.N. A graphical simulation of the 2,000-year lag in Neolithic occupation between Central Anatolia and the Aegean basin Archaeol. Anthropol. Sci. 2015; 7 :319-327 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar 49. Düring, B. Breaking the bond: investigating the Neolithic expansion in Asia Minor in the seventh millennium BC J. World Prehist. 2013; 26 :75-100 Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar ). Subsequently, in the Southern Caucasus, the abrupt appearance of a Neolithic lifestyle and the introduction of exogenous domesticated animal and plant species ca. 6000 BCE suggests some type of interaction with, and eventually intrusion of Neolithic populations from the neighboring regions, among which Southeastern Anatolia—along with Zagros and the Caspian belt—could be one of the most suitable candidates ( Chataigner et al., 2014 40. Chataigner, C. ∙ Badalyan, R. ∙ Arimura, M. The Neolithic of the Caucasus Oxford University Press, 2014 Crossref Google Scholar ). Related to these events, the genetic structure of domesticated caprine populations within the Near East began to break down, and by the Chalcolithic period, goat herds across the region were found to harbor ancestries both from eastern and western Neolithic populations ( Daly et al., 2018; Kadowaki et al., 2017 47. Daly, K.G. ∙ Maisano Delser, P. ∙ Mullin, V.E. ... Ancient goat genomes reveal mosaic domestication in the Fertile Crescent Science. 2018; 361 :85-88 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar 85. Kadowaki, S. ∙ Ohnishi, K. ∙ Arai, S. ...

Osteoarchaeol. 2017; 27 :245-260 Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar ). Although the exact timing of this admixture is not known, the parallel between human and livestock genetic histories suggests that livestock moved not only through trade networks but also together with people, as well as their material culture, ideas, and practices. This is indicated, for instance, by the circular Neolithic architecture of the Southern Caucasus ( Baudouin, 2019; Lyonnet et al., 2016 26. Baudouin, E. Rethinking architectural techniques of the Southern Caucasus in the 6 th millennium BC: A re-examination of former data and new insights Paéorient. 2019; 45 :115-150 Google Scholar 110. Lyonnet, B. ∙ Guliyev, F. ∙ Bouquet, L. ... Mentesh Tepe, an early settlement of the Shomu-Shulaveri Culture in Azerbaijan Quat. Int. 2016; 395 :170-183 Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar ), which is reminiscent of the Halaf traditions, that were developing during the early 6 th millennium in North Mesopotamia and along the Anatolian stretches of the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys.
In the subsequent millennia and until the Late Bronze Age, genetic continuity persisted in North-Central and Eastern Anatolia, which is supported by the genetic similarity of these later populations and the absence of new ancestry sources after the Neolithic period. This contradicts prior hypotheses for population change based on archaeological evidence of intense cultural interactions during this period. For example, the site of İkiztepe on the Turkish Black Sea Coast contains a material culture with strong Balkan affinities, and this has been argued to signify direct contact with populations across the Black Sea (e.g., Thissen, 1993 201. Thissen, L. New Insights in Balkan-Anatolian Connections in the Late Chalcolithic: Old Evidence from the Turkish Black Sea Littoral Anatol. Stud. 1993; 43 :207-237 Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar ), but these contacts do not seem to be accompanied by gene flow.
The site of Arslantepe provides another representative example. At the beginning of EBA, archaeological evidence at the site strongly suggests the presence of a disruptive socio-political conflict that led to the occupation of Arslantepe by pastoral populations with a connection to the Caucasus. In PCA and f 4 - statistics, two individuals dating to this period show excess affinity with populations from the Caucasus and the Pontic steppe compared to their peers, while later Arslantepe_EBA individuals do not share this Caucasian affinity ( Table S10 ). This implies that the postulated demic interaction must have been transient and of small scale, although the small sample size from Arslantepe_EBA (n = 4) may not be sufficient to detect it. Subtle gene flow is consistent with recent findings from the site, suggesting that the EBA pastoralists occupying the site were more likely well-established local groups moving around the mountains rather than intrusive groups from the Caucasus ( Frangipane, 2014 57. Frangipane, M. After collapse: Continuity and Disruption in the settlement by Kura-Araxes-linked pastoral groups at Arslantepe-Malatya (Turkey). New data Paéorient. 2014; 40 :169-182 Google Scholar ).
The genetic landscape of Arslantepe also has important implications with respect to the interactions with the Mesopotamian world. Archaeological evidence indicates that in the 4 th millennium BCE Mesopotamian populations established colonies in Southeastern Anatolia and Northern Syria (e.g., Habuba Kabira, Jebel Aruda, Hacinebi) during a period referred to as the Uruk Expansion ( Algaze, 2005 12. Algaze, G. The Uruk World System: the Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization University of Chicago Press, 2005 Google Scholar ). However, the Uruk expansion was also a very complex and deep process of socio-cultural transformation that reoriented the economic, political, and cultural interests of indigenous elites toward Southern Mesopotamia. Artifacts in Arslantepe reflect this complexity, and the genetic continuity shown here supports the notion that indigenous populations adopted these broader Uruk features and ideas without the transmission of genes.
In contrast to the rest of Anatolia, the Northern Levant stands out as a region of the Near East with traceable post-Neolithic changes in the genetic structure. We found that the gene pools at Ebla and Alalakh can only be explained by more complex models that require additional contributions both from the Caucasus and Southern Levant. The inclusion of a source related to the Caucasus in our proposed model raises the question whether this turnover could be linked to the expansion of the Transcaucasian Kura-Araxes material culture to the Levant. This expansion is recorded in the region of the Northern Levant ca. 2800 BCE and could be associated with the movement/migration of people from Eastern Anatolia and the Southern Caucasian highlands ( Greenberg and Palumbi, 2015; Greenberg et al., 2014 66. Greenberg, R. ∙ Palumbi, G. Corridors and Colonies: Comparing Fourth–Third Millennia BC Interactions in Southeast Anatolia and the Levant Knapp, A.B. ∙ van Dommelen, P. (Editors) The Cambridge Prehistory of the Bronze and Iron Age Mediterranean Cambridge University Press, 2015 Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar 67. Greenberg, R. ∙ Shimelmitz, R. ∙ Iserlis, M. New evidence for the Anatolian origins of ‘Khirbet Kerak Ware people’ at Tel Bet Yerah (Israel), ca 2800 BC Paéorient. 2014; 40 :183-201 Google Scholar ). However, our results do not support this scenario for a number of reasons: (1) we do not find any substantial increase of Caucasus-related ancestry in the populations of the primary expansion area of Kura-Araxes (e.g., Eastern Anatolia), (2) populations from the highlands of the Southern Caucasus—including individuals from a Kura-Araxes context (“L.Caucasus_EBA”)—as secondary source populations also fail, and (3) so do models with Arslantepe from Eastern Anatolia, a population located mid-way along the proposed expansion route from the Southern Caucasus to the Northern Levant.
Consequently, these interpretative caveats call for consideration of alternative historical scenarios, including scenarios of multiple gene-flow events that could have taken place in the intervening two millennia between the Tell Kurdu population and those of Bronze Age Ebla and Alalakh. However, written sources, archaeological, and paleoclimatic evidence suggest that a narrower time period—the end of the EBA—had been very critical with respect to political tensions and population mobility. It was during this period, for example, that Ebla was destroyed twice and re-established at the beginning of MBA. There are extensive textual references from the end of the EBA through the LBA referring to groups of people arriving into the area of the Amuq Valley. Although these groups were named, likely based on designations (e.g., Amorites, Hurrians), the formative context of their (cultural) identity and their geographic origins remain debated. One recent hypothesis ( Weiss, 2014, 2017; Akar and Kara, 2020 5. Akar, M. ∙ Kara, D. The formation of collective, political and cultural memory in the Middle Bronze Age: foundation and termination rituals at Toprakhisar Höyük Anatolian Studies. 2020; Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar 213. Weiss, H. The northern Levant during the intermediate Bronze Age: altered trajectories Killebrew, A.E. (Editor) The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Levant: c. 8000–332 BCE Oxford University Press, 2014 Google Scholar 214. Weiss, H. 4.2 ka BP megadrought and the Akkadian collapse Weiss, H. (Editor) Megadrought and Collapse: From Early Agriculture to Angkor Oxford University Press, 2017 Google Scholar ) associates the arrival of these groups with climate-forced population movement during the “4.2k BP event,” a Mega Drought that led to the abandonment of the entire Khabur river valley in Northern Mesopotamia and the search of nearby habitable areas.
Taking the above into consideration, we suggest that the ancestries we inferred for Alalakh and Ebla might best describe the genetic make-up of the EBA populations of unsampled Northern Mesopotamia. During the following MBA and LBA, we find no evidence of genetic disruption, even though shifts in territorial control dynamics between kingdoms/empires affected Ebla’s and Alalakh’s socio-cultural development (see STAR Methods ). Nevertheless, the case of the Alalakh individual with likely Central Asian origin is a finding that can be interpreted within the context of nascent internationalism of the Middle and Late Bronze Age Eastern Mediterranean societies. It calls for future research on the various societal features of this phenomenon and how these are reflected on the individual life histories.
Overall, our large-scale genomic analysis reveals two major genetic events. First, during the Late Neolithic, gene pools across Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus mixed, resulting in an admixture cline. Second, during the Early Bronze Age, Northern Levant populations experienced gene flow in a process that likely involved yet to-be-sampled neighboring populations from Mesopotamia. Even though we could detect subtle and transient gene flow in Arslantepe, we acknowledge that disentangling questions related to local-scale population dynamics within the homogeneous Chalcolithic and Bronze Age Anatolian gene pool might be beyond the resolution of current analytical tools. Furthermore, while our sampling expands in number and geographic range on previous studies, the critical area of Mesopotamia remains unsampled; thus, although our picture of the genetic landscape of the Near East is highly suggestive, it remains incomplete. Nevertheless, the cumulative genetic dataset of Anatolia, the Southern Caucasus, and the Northern Levant between the Early and Late Bronze Age indicates that, following the genetic events of the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, there was no intrusion of genetically distinct populations in this region. This conclusion is of great importance with respect to our understanding of the formation of complex Bronze Age socio-political entities.

Alkhantepe, Azerbaijan
39.3607139°N, 48.4613556°E
Excavation: Mughan Neolithic-Eneolithic expedition of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, 2006-2017, directed by Tufan Isaak oglu Akhundov
The site of Alkhantepe is situated on a plain without visible water ways, 4 km north of the Uchtepe village, in the Jalilabad district of Azerbaijan. It is a narrow belt of the eastern part of the Mughan steppe limited by the spurs of Brovary Range from the west and the Caspian Sea from the east. Presently, the topography of the site is flat with its north-eastern part slightly refracting and lowering. The surface of the settlement has been surveyed for many years and samples of ceramic vessels and stone objects have been found. Test trenches and expanded excavations show that the area occupied by the ancient settlement was about 4 ha in size and the thickness of cultural layers is up to 3 m. Materials recovered from the surface surveys as well as the excavation of cultural layers are identical and give the opportunity to relate this settlement to the Leilatepe tradition.
The cultural layers below the modern-day surface of the site consisted of seven construction horizons which can be divided into two distinct units. As it became clear in the process of excavation, the upper 1.2 m. cultural layer was formed in ancient times due to an earthquake which resulted in a period of abandonment (at least of the excavated parts of the site). Settlement activity resumed shortly afterward. Judging from the material evidence, this new settlement equally represents a new stage in the history of the site with distinct features in architecture and building techniques.
In contrast to the preceding time when adobe was widely used, buildings of the younger settlement stage were light constructions of rectangular form made of reeds and poles covered with clay and with a hearth in the middle.
For the first stage of settlement, excavations revealed round and rectangular mud-huts with subsoil walls and walls constructed from adobe, altars, different household hearths and production furnaces, pits, and partition walls of adobe. The burials of the settlement’s inhabitants were found on different levels among these constructions. The burials included individuals of all age groups, from new-borns and teenagers to adults. Only one exception was observed: babies were buried in ceramic vessels.
Survey and excavation uncovered a rich archaeological material consisting mainly of ceramics of Leilatepe tradition that is also represented by tools and objects of stone and bone. Additionally, metal objects, metallic slag and tools of metallic production were found ( Akhundov, 2014, 2018 8. Akhundov, T.I. Алхантепе – поселение начала бронзового века в Азербайджане. С. 78-92.

One individual from Alkhantepe was analyzed for aDNA and is included in genetic analyses. • ▪ ALX002 (Alkhantepe Burial N2) is the individual from a burial that was revealed in a distance from the eastern wall in the south square of the excavated area at a depth of 1,48 m. The remains of this individual were buried in a shallow oval pit and they, as well as the pit, were poorly preserved. However, judging from the preserved remains, the deceased was put into the pit in a crouched position, lying on his/her left side with the head placed on a north-east orientation. A lead ring with unclosed ends, made of round wire, was found lying on the shin’s bone. Dating of human tooth: 3776-3661 cal BCE (4950 ± 23 BP, MAMS-40330)
38.381944°N, 38.361111°E
Excavation: Sapienza University of Rome, 1961-present, directed by Marcella Frangipane
The site of Arslantepe is a 4.5 ha mound located in the highland fertile Malatya plain of Eastern Anatolia, 12 km from the western bank of the Euphrates river. From the point of view of Mesopotamian archaeology, the site is at a geographical and cultural border zone, in the northern highlands outside Mesopotamia proper and along pathways that potentially connect the alluvium of the Euphrates with different worlds, from the Caucasus to the Pontic regions and Central Anatolia. The uninterrupted and extensive excavation of the site since 1961 brought to light a four millennia long occupation starting around 4700 BCE, but possibly even earlier, as testified by the presence of Neolithic and Chalcolithic pottery on the surface of the mound. Among this are Ubaid ceramics and we know that the Malatya plain was directly involved by the expansion of Mesopotamian Ubaid culture, also by the Ubaid presence at the neighboring site of Değirmentepe. The finding of Halaf period ceramics suggests that this contact was strong in Neolithic phases too. During the fourth millennium, Arslantepe undergoes developments that structurally resemble those of Mesopotamia, even though it shows its own peculiarities, with a clear and steady growth in economic and social development, which brings the site to develop a primary state system toward the end of the millennium, parallel to that of Mesopotamia, but with features of its own ( Frangipane, 2018 60. Frangipane, M. Different Trajectories in State Formation in Greater Mesopotamia: A View from Arslantepe (Turkey) J. Archaeol. Res. 2018; 26 :3-63 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ). In the earlier phases of this period (Arslantepe Period VII, 3900-3400 BCE) contacts with Central Anatolia are also evidenced, but material culture shows that the strongest relations of the site are with the south-west toward the Amuq and Quoeiq ( Balossi Restelli et al., 2012 22. Balossi Restelli, F. ∙ Alvaro, C. ∙ Erdal, Y.S. ... Late Chalcolithic 3-4 Developments in the Upper Euphrates Malatya Plain, Rome Sapienza Università di Roma. 2012; 27 :235-259 Google Scholar ). The moment of proper state development (Arslantepe Period VI A, 3400-3200 BCE) is revealed by the foundation of a precocious palace complex with a sophisticated bureaucracy and control over the economy of the populations, which shows an increase in contacts with Mesopotamia proper, but also with other mountainous regions of North-Central and North-Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus ( Frangipane, 2012b 56. Frangipane, M. Fourth Millennium Arslantepe: The Development of a Centralised Society without Urbanisation Origini: Preistoria E Protostoria Delle Civilta Antiche. 2012; 34 :19-40 Google Scholar ). The contacts with the north-eastern regions further increase at the collapse of this early state system, when pastoral groups that were already living in the area and moving along the mountains with their flocks of sheep and goats briefly settle at the site, by building huts and fences for animals directly on the ruins of the palace (period VI B1, 3200-3100 BCE), giving rise to a period of profound instability characterized by meetings and clashes of various populations contending the site. In the course of their seasonal occupations, the pastoral groups of Period VIB1 also built more durable structures, among which a large mud-brick communal building, probably used a reception hall for meetings and feasting ( Frangipane, 2012a, 2014, 2015b; Siracusano and Palumbi, 2014 55. Frangipane, M.

(Editors) Proceedings of the 8th International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East 30 April–4 May 2012, University of Warsaw, Vol. 3 Harrassowitz Verlag, 2014 Google Scholar ). This is a period of unrest and fast changes: Following the less permanent occupation of Period VI B1, an imposing fortification wall was built on the top of the mound, surrounding a large open area and with a series of rooms adjoining it on the interior (period VIB2, early phase). In this phase, only the remains of post-holes, probably belonging to temporary huts and fences, were found outside the wall, and the dates obtained from charcoals and seeds from the rooms adjoining the wall indicate an approximate date of about 3100 BCE. In a second phase of Period VIB2, a village of farmers was extensively brought to light along the slope, outside the fortification wall that was not in use anymore, and was dated between 3000 and 2850 BCE. The frequent overlapping of the C14 dates from all these periods, as well as the features of the archaeological evidence suggest that all the events occurred at Arslantepe from the destruction and collapse of the Palace to the establishment of the VIB2 village of farmers seem to have succeeded one another in a very fast and dramatic way, in the course of a short period of time.
Occupation at Arslantepe continues uninterruptedly throughout the whole 3 rd millennium with an initial return to mobility (VI C, 2750-2500 BCE), followed by the presence of competing small policies in the whole plain, of which Arslantepe was probably one of the largest (VI D, 2500-2000 BCE) ( Frangipane, 2012a; Conti and Persiani, 1993 41. Conti, A.M. ∙ Persiani, C. When worlds collide. Cultural developments in Eastern Anatolia in the Early Bronze Age Frangipane, M. ∙ Hauptmann, H. ∙ Liverani, M. ...

The Collapse of the 4th Millennium Centralised System at Arslantepe and the Far-Reaching Changes in 3rd Millennium Societies Origini: Preistoria E Protostoria Delle Civilta Antiche. 2012; 34 :237-260 Google Scholar ). This was a period of greater stability and an apparent decrease in external contacts, as material culture shows a remarkable continuity for several centuries.
During the 2 nd millennium the site comes under Hittite influence (first with the Hittite reign and then the Empire) ( Manuelli, 2013 112. Manuelli, F. Arslantepe, Late Bronze Age. HIttite influence and local traditions in an Eastern Anatolian community Sapienza Università di Roma, 2013 Google Scholar ) and will eventually become capital of a Neo-Hittite reign at the collapse of the Empire. Arslantepe is eventually abandoned after the Assyrian king Sargon II conquers and destroys the site in 712 BCE.
Human remains at Arslantepe have been found both as burials and as scattered human remains within pits and fills of buildings. Period VII is the one with the most finds, predominantly formed by burials related to domestic occupation, thus dug under the floors of houses. Buried individuals are mostly infants and adult women (Erdal and Balossi Restelli, in press). Rarely sparse human bones are found, but are probably due to disturbances of burials that must have taken place already in antiquity. In the latest level of occupation in Period VII a burial ground has also been identified, outside a Temple structure, where possibly special burials were positioned: 2 infant jar burials were identified, one infant stone cist and ad adult inhumation.
The following VI A period is the period in which Arslantepe becomes the center of a primary state system, testified by a monumental palatial complex. No burials belonging to this phase have been found, but in one of the two temples of the complex (Temple A) a human skull was lying on the floor at the center of the building together with the skull of a wild pig. Both must have been part of a ritual practice, taking place in the room.
Yet different is the situation of human bones found in Period VI B1, when most remains are partial skeletons, found in pits or scattered within fills covering the collapsed palace ruins, thus not proper burials.
In the following VI B2 village of Early Bronze Age very interestingly the practice of burying infants under the house floors appears to have disappeared. An interesting group of human bones have been however found in a pit cut into the floor of the open space inside the fortification wall in the early phase of the period. These belong to a minimum number of 16 partial individuals not in anatomical connection, mostly male and adults, found in this pit together with some animal bones ( Erdal, 2012b 52. Erdal, Y.S. The Population Replacement at Arslantepe: Reflections on the Human Remains Origini: Preistoria E Protostoria Delle Civilta Antiche. 2012; 34 :301-316 Google Scholar ).
To a period in between the end of VI B1 and the beginning of VI B2 belongs the so-called ‘royal tomb’ ( Frangipane et al., 2001 61. Frangipane, M. ∙ Di Nocera, G.M. ∙ Hauptmann, A. ... New Symbols of a New Power in a “Royal” Tomb from 3 000 BC Arslantepe, Malatya (Turkey) Paéorient. 2001; 27 :105-139 Google Scholar ), an imposing cist grave built at the bottom of a large pit, which was very atypical for the local culture. It was an extremely rich tomb containing an adult man with plenty of funerary gifts among which 65 metal objects, and with a complex funerary practice including the possible sacrifice of 4 adolescents (almost all female) on the stone slabs covering the cist ( Palumbi, 2011; Frangipane et al., 2001 61. Frangipane, M. ∙ Di Nocera, G.M. ∙ Hauptmann, A. ... New Symbols of a New Power in a “Royal” Tomb from 3 000 BC Arslantepe, Malatya (Turkey) Paéorient. 2001; 27 :105-139 Google Scholar 156. Palumbi, G. The Arslantepe Royal Tomb and the “manipulation” of the Kurgan ideology in Eastern Anatolia at the beginning of the third millennium Borgna, E. ∙ Müller Celka, S. (Editors) Ancestral Landscapes: Burial Mounds in the Copper and Bronze Ages. Proceedings of the International Conference held in Udine, May 15th-18th, 2008 Travaux de la Maison de l'Orient méditerranéen, 2011; 47-59 Google Scholar ). Ceramic materials in the tomb are perfectly in keeping with what was found in the early phase of Period VIB2, as well as in the communal building of Period VIB1, that is a mixture of local light-colored wares with Reserved Slip decoration in the Uruk tradition and Red-Black handmade ware of Caucasian and Anatolian inspiration.
The rest of the Early Bronze Age period sees rare human remains, and only one of a male burial from the vicinities of the domestic area has been included in this work.
Twenty-two individuals from Arslantepe produced genome-wide data and are included in genetic analyses. • ART001 (H156 S138) is a female in pit burial from Period VI D2. Evidence of epicondylitis was observed on both humeri. The remains also exhibit evidence of severe osteoarthritis. Dating of human bone: 2470-2301 cal BCE (3908 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33533). • ▪ ART004 (H238 S156) is an old male in a pit dug under and sealed by the floor of a house. Period VII. Dating of human bone: 3758-3642 cal BCE (4906 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33534) • ▪ ART005 (H250 S169) is an old female buried in a domestic area of the settlement from Period VII. The relation with the overlying architecture is not preserved. A red slipped and burnished beaker were held in her hands and traces of red ochre were found on and next to the knees. Evidence for the following pathological conditions was present on the remains: osteoporosis, hyperostosis frontalis interna, severe osteoarthritis on joints, severe osteoarthritis on cervical and lumbar vertebra, dental diseases such as dental carries, periapical abscess, periodontitis, dental calculus, and linear enamel hypoplasia. Dating of human bone: 3770-3654 cal BCE (4934 ± 27 BP, MAMS-33535). • ▪ ART009 (H326) is an adult male represented by a skull and disarticulated bones found on the floor of a dwelling from Period VI B2, together with other bones from at least two individuals. No pathology was found on the preserved bones. Dating of human bone: 2834-2497 cal BCE (4069 ± 20 BP, MAMS-33536) • ▪ ART010 (H327 S220-2) is a ca. 7-year-old child represented by a skull and disarticulated long bones found on the floor of a dwelling from Period VI B2, together with other bones from at least two individuals. The cranium exhibits evidence of a possible perimortem trauma on left parietal bone and infectious lesions on the endocranial surface of the occipital. Linear enamel hypoplasia was observed on the permanent upper central incisors and the deciduous canines display evidence of non-alimentary use. Dating of human bone: 2857-2505 cal BCE (4095 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33537) • ▪ ART011 (S220-1) is a ca. 30-year-old female represented by a skull and disarticulated long bones found on the floor of a dwelling from Period VI B2, together with other bones from ART009 and ART010. No pathology was found on preserved cranial bones. Dating: 2839-2581 cal BCE (4103 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33538) • ▪ ART012 (H331) is a young adult female represented by a skull found on the floor of central room of Temple A (palatial complex of Period VI A) lying next to the skull of a wild pig. No pathology was found on this skull. Dating of human bone: 3338-3031 cal BCE (4479 ± 27 BP, MAMS-33539)
S216 is a simple pit containing a collective burial of human remains belonging to a minimum of 16 individuals. The pit is partly sealed by a VI B2 floor surface and cuts VI B1 levels of occupation of Arslantepe. There are also bone fragments of animals. This pit is not a burial type that is encountered in this period in Anatolia or neighboring areas. The human remains in this secondary burial consist of unarticulated cranial and post-cranial bones. Some small bones such as metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges are also present but they are very few compared to the long bones and crania. Bioarchaeological studies of the human remains suggest that there are at least 13 adult crania. Moreover, three sub-adults are also present among the human remains. A total of eight out of the 13 adult crania have signs of perimortem blunt forced traumas ( Erdal, 2012b 52. Erdal, Y.S. The Population Replacement at Arslantepe: Reflections on the Human Remains Origini: Preistoria E Protostoria Delle Civilta Antiche. 2012; 34 :301-316 Google Scholar ). Petrous bones from the following eleven individuals were analyzed for DNA: • ▪ ART014 (S216 Cr2) is the cranium of a male individual.

The settlement on the rock massif Büyükkaya (Çorum Province), within the boundaries of the later Hittite capital Hattuša, is, so far, the oldest known settlement in North-Central Turkey ( Schoop, 2005, 2018 186. Schoop, U.-D. Early Chalcolithic in North-Central Anatolia: The evidence from Boğazköy-Büyükkaya TÜBA-AR. 2005; 8 :15-37 Crossref Google Scholar 189. Schoop, U.-D. Die Besiedlung des Oberen Plateaus vom Chalkolithikum bis in die althethitische Zeit Seeher, J. (Editor) Büyükkaya II. Bauwerke und Befunde der Grabungskampagnen 1952–1955 und 1993–1998 Walter de Gruyter GmbH., 2018 Google Scholar ). A small hamlet-sized village was situated on the uppermost plateau of Büyükkaya, high above the later city area, from where it overlooked the southern end of the Budaközü Valley. Although detailed information about the palaeo-environment of the area is lacking, this area must have been covered by forest in the past and offered few of the open spaces which are more typical for other parts of Anatolia.
Later use of the location is responsible for the fragmentary preservation of the site. Covering an area of ca. 300 sqm at the southern end of the plateau, a number of floors, hearths and storage pits were found which indicated the (probably short-lived) existence of a few small wooden structures above a fill consisting of burnt pisé material. At the western limit of the site, the segment of a narrow ditch was found. A single grave, belonging to a young child, was found beneath a strip of flooring, not far from one of the hearths.
Very few small finds were recovered, including a number of sickle blades made from local flint, a few heavy stone pounders and a series of fragments of polished marble bracelets. The pastoral economy relied predominantly on the exploitation of cattle, sheep and goats ( von den Driesch and Nadja, 2004 209. von den Driesch, A. ∙ Nadja, P. Vor- und frühgeschichtliche Nutztierhaltung und Jagd auf Büyükkaya in Boğazköy-Ḫattuša, Zentralanatolien Mainz : P. von Zabern, 2004 Google Scholar ).
The pottery of this small settlement displays the dark-faced, burnished surfaces which are typical for the Anatolian north of this time. A small number of sherds are decorated in stab-and-drag technique or painted on a white slip. Although the assemblage is certainly representative of a discrete cultural entity which has not yet discovered elsewhere, there are clear morphological links toward contemporary Early Chalcolithic societies further to the west (Eskişehir area) and the south (Cappadocia/the Central Anatolian Plain).
Two radiocarbon dates, taken from human bone (see below) and from charcoal recovered from one of the pits, indicate a chronological position of the settlement within the second quarter of the 6 th millennium BC ( Schoop et al., 2012 191. Schoop, U.-D. ∙ Pickard, C. ∙ Bonsall, C. Radiocarbon dating chalcolithic Büyükkaya Archaeol. Anz. 2012; 2012 :115-120 Google Scholar ).
The single individual from Boğazköy-Büyükkaya produced genome-wide data and is included in genetic analyses. • ▪ CBT018 (Grave 347/410-315) is an infant aged 6-12 months ( Thomas, 2012; Schoop et al., 2012 191. Schoop, U.-D. ∙ Pickard, C. ∙ Bonsall, C. Radiocarbon dating chalcolithic Büyükkaya Archaeol. Anz. 2012; 2012 :115-120 Google Scholar 203. Thomas, J.-L. Human remains from a 6th millennium B.C. infant burial found at Boğazköy-Büyükkaya, Turkey Archaeol. Anz. 2012; 2012 :121-123 Google Scholar ) buried in a pit grave without any goods. The skeleton was found in contracted body position. In all probability, this grave represents an intramural burial below a house floor. Dating of human bone: 5626-5515 cal BCE (6635 ± 30 BP, SUERC-36800 [GU25423]).

Çamlıbel Tarlası is a small settlement situated on a low plateau within a narrow lateral valley branching off the southern end of the main Budaközü Valley (Çorum Province), approximately 2.5 km west of the earlier site on Büyükkaya ( Schoop, 2015 188. Schoop, U.-D. Çamlıbel Tarlası: Late Chalcolithic settlement and economy in the Budaközü Valley (north-central Anatolia) Steadman, S.R. ∙ McMahon, G. (Editors) The Archaeology of Anatolia I. Recent Discoveries (2011–2014) Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2015 Google Scholar ). The site was the location of a small hamlet which never comprised more than three to five contemporary houses. There are three distinctive and relatively short periods of permanent human presence at Çamlıbel Tarlası. In between these habitation phases, the site continued to be visited on a seasonal bases, probably by the same community, as shown by the remnants of continued agricultural and other activities during these times.
One attracting factor of the location appears to have been the presence of copper ore outcrops further into the valley. Within the settlement, fragments of copper ore, slag and crucibles show metallurgical as well as other pyrotechnical activities such as the production of enstatite (artificial steatite), quicklime and charcoal-burning. Beginning environmental degradation in the surroundings may have been a consequence of these fuel-intensive activities ( Marsh, 2010 115. Marsh, B. Geoarchaeology of the human landscape at Boğazköy-Hattuša Archaeol. Anz. 2010; 2010 :201-207 Google Scholar ).
Houses had walls constructed from stamped pisé on stone bases. Many had domed bread ovens in their interiors, standing on floors made from stamped earth or lime plaster. One ÇBT III building (S3 “Burnt House”) clearly had a special, probably ritualistic purpose. Notable finds include a casting mold for ring-shaped figurines, enstatite micro-beads, Cappadocian obsidian and blades made from exotic flint. The pastoral economy showed an emphasis on cattle and pig-raising, with evidence of secondary product use for cattle and caprines ( Bartosiewicz and Gillis, 2011 25. Bartosiewicz, L. ∙ Gillis, R. Preliminary report on the animal remains from Çamlıbel Tarlası, Central Anatolia Archaeol. Anz. 2011; 2011 :76-79 Google Scholar ). The plant-based economy suggests the working of small, intensively tended agricultural plots, with a high importance of legumes ( Papadopoulou and Bogaard, 2012 159. Papadopoulou, I. ∙ Bogaard, A. A preliminary study of the charred macrobotanical assemblage from Çamlıbel Tarlası, north-central Anatolia Archaeol. Anz. 2012; 2012 :123-132 Google Scholar ).
A total of 17 graves were retrieved during excavations. The majority belonged to infants and children ( Thomas, 2011, 2017 202. Thomas, J.-L. Preliminary observations on the human skeletal remains from Çamlıbel Tarlası Archaeol. Anz. 2011; 2011 :73-76 Google Scholar 204. Thomas, J.-L. Late Chalcolithic skeletal remains and associated mortuary practices from Çamlıbel Tarlası in Central Anatolia Murphy, E.M. ∙ Le Roy, M. (Editors) Children, Death and Burial: Archaeological Discourses Oxbow, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ). Most of the stratigraphically attributable graves belong to ÇBT II and a small number to ÇBT III. Two adults seem to have been buried at times when the site was uninhabited. Babies and younger children (up to two years) were found in large pottery containers, within which their bones were not usually encountered in articulated arrangement. Elder children and adults, by contrast, were buried in narrow pits, as intact skeletons in contracted body position. With the possible exception of Graves 4 and 13, none of the burials contained any grave goods. Most children were encountered in exterior spaces, in close proximity to the house walls. Deviating from this scheme, three graves (2,16 and 17) were found below the floors of two separate structures. Remarkably, DNA analysis has shown these three individuals to be siblings (see Figure S1 ). Human remains and a large set of animal bones were subjected to stable-isotope analysis ( Pickard et al., 2016, 2017 165. Pickard, C. ∙ Schoop, U.-D. ∙ Dalton, A. ... Diet at Late Chalcolithic Çamlıbel Tarlası, north-central Anatolia: an isotopic perspective J. Archaeol. Sci. 2016; 5 :296-306 Google Scholar 166. Pickard, C. ∙ Schoop, U.-D. ∙ Bartosiewicz, L. ... Animal keeping in Chalcolithic North-Central Anatolia: What can stable isotope analysis add? Archaeol. Anthropol. Sci. 2017; 9 :1349-1362 Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar ).
Radiocarbon analysis conducted on plant seeds and human bone show a short chronological span of the whole sequence of 70 to 140 years toward the middle of the 4 th millennium BCE (3676/3535 to 3634/3508 cal BCE cal; 17 samples) ( Schoop et al., 2009 190. Schoop, U.-D. ∙ Grave, P. ∙ Kealhofer, L. ... Radiocarbon dates from Chalcolithic Çamlıbel Tarlası Archaeol. Anz. 2009; 2009 :66-67 Google Scholar ). Çamlıbel Tarlası and the nearby site of Yarıkkaya constitute a variant of a larger cultural entity whose best-known representative is the Late Chalcolithic settlement at the base of Alişar Höyük ( Schoop, 2011 187. Schoop, U.-D. The Chalcolithic on the Plateau Steadman, S.R. ∙ McMahon, G. (Editors) The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia (10,000–323 BCE) Oxford University Press, 2011 Google Scholar ).
Twelve individuals from Çamlıbel Tarlası produced genome-wide genetic data and are included in genetic analyses. • ▪ CBT001 (Grave 1, ÇBT 204-1103) is a 9-15 months-old infant in a jar burial in juxtaposition to the west wall of building S9 (ÇBT II), under a strip of external flooring. Dating of human bone: 3632-3378 cal BCE (4725 ± 20 BP, MAMS-41627). • ▪ CBT002 (Grave 2, ÇBT 327-921) is a 9-15 months-old infant in an intramural jar burial within one of two immediately juxtaposed pits under ÇBT II building S11. The outlines of the neighboring empty pit were marked and visible on the surface of the floor. Traces of red ochre were found on some of the bones. This grave also contained a few bones of a second individuum, a second trimester fetus. Dating of human bone: 3652-3525 cal BCE (4809 ± 30 BP, MAMS-41630). • ▪ CBT003 (Grave 3, ÇBT 80-1086) is a 2-4 years-old infant, probably buried in contracted body position. The burial was fragmentary and came from a disturbed ÇBT II-III context but is possibly associated with the “Burnt House” S3 (ÇBT III). No grave goods were found. • ▪ CBT004 (Grave 4, ÇBT 406-3224) is a 8-10 years-old infant buried in a pit grave from a ÇBT II/III context. The skeleton was recovered in an extremely contracted body position. Copper staining on the upward-facing mandible and disturbance of vertebrae suggest that the grave was re-opened and that a metallic artifact was recovered at some point after the burial. Dating of human bone: 3636-3521 cal BCE (4765 ± 20 BP, MAMS-41628). • ▪ CBT005 (Grave 5, ÇBT 464-4072) is a 6-8 years-old child in a pit grave with the skeleton in contracted body position. This grave was found close to a major ÇBT IV building (S6), dug into virgin soil and covered by topsoil (context ÇBT I-IV). Dating of human bone: 3630- 3377 cal BCE (4713 ± 21 BP, MAMS-41629). • ▪ CBT010 (Grave 10, ÇBT 923-5423) is a 2 nd -3 rd trimester fetus in a jar burial cut into bedrock, associated with a fragmentary ÇBT III building above. • ▪ CBT011 (Grave 11, ÇBT 970-6074) is a 7-9 years-old child buried in a pit grave with the skeleton in contracted body position. The grave was in an external area, in juxtaposition to the southeast wall of building S21 (ÇBT II). • ▪ CBT013 (Grave 13, ÇBT 950-6118) is a 6-8 years-old child buried in a pit grave with the skeleton in contracted body position. The burial was found under an auxiliary structure to the building S21 (ÇBT II). A bent copper perforator was found underneath the skull bones. Dating of human bone: 3643-3526 cal BCE (4796 ± 23 BP, MAMS-41631). • ▪ CBT014 (Grave 14, ÇBT 971-6144) is a 4-5 years-old child buried in a pit grave with the skeleton in contracted body position. The burial was found in an external area close to the building S29 (ÇBT II). Dating of human bone: 3640-3385 cal BCE (4767 ± 28 BP, MAMS-41632). • ▪ CBT015 (Grave 15, ÇBT 978-6140) is a fetus - 3 months-old infant in a jar burial below the building S21 (ÇBT II). Dating of human bone: 3643-3522 cal BCE (4787 ± 28 BP, MAMS-41633). • CBT016 (Grave 16, ÇBT 894-5819) is a 1.5-2.5 years-old infant in a jar burial below the east room of the building S25 (ÇBT II). The location of the grave was marked by a circle of stones set in the floor. This grave also contained a rib from a second individuum, a fetus. Dating of human bone: 3692-3527 cal BCE (4828 ± 29 BP, MAMS-41634). • ▪ CBT017 (Grave 17, ÇBT 1010-5876) is a 12-15 months-old infant whose skeletal remains were poorly preserved. The burial was possibly a pit grave found under a strip of flooring under the west room of building S25 (ÇBT II).

İkiztepe is a prehistoric site in the Black Sea Region in Anatolia, Turkey. The site is located 7 km west of modern town of Bafra in Samsun province, on a hilly area, 9 km north of actual seashore of Black Sea ( Bilgi, 2004; Özdemir and Erdal, 2012 28. Bilgi, Ö. İkiztepe Mezarlık Kazıları ve Ölü Gömme Gelenekleri 2000-2002 Dönemleri Anadolu Araştırmaları. 2004; 17 :25-50 Google Scholar 154. Özdemir, K. ∙ Erdal, Y.S. Element Analizleri ile Erken Tunç Çağı İkiztepe Toplumunun Yaşadığı Ekolojik Ortam ve Besin Kaynaklarının Belirlenmesi Üzerine Bir Deneme Akyol, A.A. ∙ Özdemir, K. (Editors) Türkiye’de Arkeometrinin Ulu Çınarları. Prof. Dr. Ay Melek Özer ve Prof. Dr. Şahinde Demirci’ye Armağan Homer Kitapevi, 2012 Google Scholar ). İkiztepe means twin mounds in Turkish, however it actually consists of four mounds (I-IV). All these mounds were settled from the Early Chalcolithic period up to the Early Hittite period. A total of 700 simple pit graves, dated to the Late Chalcolithic period and belonging to the dwellers of Mound III, were excavated in the extramural graveyard in Mound I ( Bilgi, 2004 28. Bilgi, Ö. İkiztepe Mezarlık Kazıları ve Ölü Gömme Gelenekleri 2000-2002 Dönemleri Anadolu Araştırmaları. 2004; 17 :25-50 Google Scholar ). Human remains, which are extremely well preserved in terms of bone and collagen contents, are housed in the Hacettepe University Skeletal Biology Laboratory (Husbio-L).
İkiztepe is surrounded by modern Bafra plain formed by the alluvial deposits of Kızılırmak and some lagoons on the sea shore ( Alkım et al., 1988 16. Alkım, U.B. ∙ Alkım, H. ∙ Bilgi, Ö. (Editors) The First and Second Season’s Excavations (1974–1975) Türk Tarih Kurumu Basımevi, 1988 Google Scholar ). It is suggested that the settlement was located on the edge of the Black Sea during the time it was settled ( Bilgi, 2000 27. Bilgi, Ö. İkiztepe Kazıları Bilgi, Ö. (Editor) Türkiye Arkeolojisi ve İstanbul Üniversitesi (1932-1999) Başak Matbaacılık ve Tanıtım Hizmetleri Ltd. Sti, 2000 Google Scholar ). Kızılırmak, 7 km to the east of the site at the present time, was running close to the settlement. The lifestyle of İkiztepe people was dependent on agriculture. However, the studies on animal remains and human mobility suggest that pastoral lifestyle might have also been important for these people ( Welton, 2010 215. Welton, M.L. Mobility and Social Organization on the Ancient Anatolian Black Sea Coast: An Archaeological, Spatial and Isotopic Investigation of the Cemetery at İkiztepe University of Toronto, 2010 Google Scholar ). Dietary habits of the people were mainly based on the terrestrial C3 food sources ( Irvine, 2017 80. Irvine, B.T. An Isotopic Analysis of Dietary Habits in Early Bronze Age Anatolia Freie Universität Berlin, 2017 Google Scholar ). Sulfur and nitrogen isotopes do not support a nutrition model that is composed of seafood and freshwater food sources.
Almost all the individuals at İkiztepe were excavated in simple pit burials without a standard tendency concerning the direction of the bodies. Except for the other Anatolian Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age settlements, İkiztepe individuals were buried in supine position with the arms parallel to the body. Plenty of metal objects such as spearhead, dagger, harpoon, hook, spiral, ring and bracelet were found together with burials ( Bilgi, 2004 28. Bilgi, Ö. İkiztepe Mezarlık Kazıları ve Ölü Gömme Gelenekleri 2000-2002 Dönemleri Anadolu Araştırmaları. 2004; 17 :25-50 Google Scholar ). Metal objects were produced by arsenical copper alloy. However, golden and silver rings, earrings, amulets, and pendants were also found. The number of grave goods tends to increase with the age of individuals. Moreover, there are some important differences between genders: males were buried mostly with weapons such as spearheads and quadruple spirals, on the other hand, females were buried with jewelleries, pottery and daggers.
A total of eleven individuals from İkiztepe produced genome-wide data and are included in genetic analyses. • ▪ IKI002 (IT SK528) is a 50 to 60-year-old female in a primary simple pit burial.

The small mound of Mentesh Tepe on the lower fan of the Zeyem Chaj – an affluent of the left bank of the Kura River, originally probably covered 0.5 ha but had been totally destroyed recently or lays beneath modern houses. Remains of its lower/main occupations were preserved under the surface. Three main periods interrupted by gaps of several centuries have been identified. The earliest (period I) is related to the Late Neolithic Shomu-Shulaveri Culture (SSC) with circular architecture both above ground and partly dug into it, and is dated by radiocarbon dates between ca. 5770-5600 BCE ( Lyonnet et al., 2016 110. Lyonnet, B. ∙ Guliyev, F. ∙ Bouquet, L. ... Mentesh Tepe, an early settlement of the Shomu-Shulaveri Culture in Azerbaijan Quat. Int. 2016; 395 :170-183 Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar ). However, being on the most eastern edge of the SSC, it also presents some specific features, and relations with areas further east in the Mil’-Karabagh Steppe have been underlined ( Lyonnet, 2017 108. Lyonnet, B. Mentesh Tepe 2012–2014. The Pottery Helwing, B. ∙ Aliyev, T. ∙ Lyonnet, B. ... (Editors) The Kura Projects. New Research on the Later Prehistory of the Southern Caucasus D. Reimer, 2017 Google Scholar ). This period provided several infant burials and an exceptional collective grave most probably dug into an abandoned circular house with 30 individuals of mixed ages and sexes in primary position, with no evidence of trauma, enamel hypoplasia or other pathology indicating a violent episode or starvation ( Pecqueur and Jovenet, 2017 162. Pecqueur, L. ∙ Jovenet, E. La sepulture 342 de Mentesh Tepe (Azerbaïdjan): un exemple de chaîne opératoire funéraire complexe au Néolithique. Etude préliminaire Helwing, B. ∙ Aliyev, T. ∙ Lyonnet, B. ... (Editors) The Kura Projects. New Research in the Later Prehistory of Southern Caucasus D. Reimer, 2017 Google Scholar ). After a long abandonment, a very light reoccupation probably by mobile groups is dated to ca. 4600 BCE (period II). It was followed ca. 4350-4100 BCE by an important settlement (period III) with a totally new rectangular, and possibly tripartite, architecture. This with several other features in the material culture point at relations with the eastern areas of the Mugan Steppe and with Northern Mesopotamia ( Lyonnet, 2012 105. Lyonnet, B. Mentesh Tepe Pottery Archäologische Mitteilingen aus Iran und Turan. 2012; 44 :97-108 Google Scholar ). Copper-based metallurgy shows a quick development ( Courcier et al., 2016 42. Courcier, A. ∙ Jalilov, B. ∙ Aliyev, I. ... The Ancient Metallurgy in Azerbaijan from the End of the Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age (6th-3rd Millennium BCE): an Overview in the Light of New Discoveries and Recent Archaeometallurgical Research Körlin, G. ∙ Prange, M. ∙ Stöllner, T. ... (Editors) From Bright Ores to Shiny Metals. Festschrift for A. Hauptmann Deutsches Bergbau-Museum, 2016 Google Scholar ). This period at Mentesh clearly announces the further development and tighter relations between Southern Caucasus (Leilatepe culture) and Northern Mesopotamia (LC2-3) in the first half of the 4 th millennium BCE ( Akhundov, 2007; Lyonnet, 2007 6. Akhundov, T. Sites de migrants venus du Proche-Orient en Transcaucasie Lyonnet, B. (Editor) Les cultures du Caucase (VIe-IIIe millénaires avant notre ère). Leurs relations avec le Proche-Orient CNRS Editions/ERC, 2007 Google Scholar 104. Lyonnet, B.

Leurs relations avec le Proche-Orient CNRS-éditions, ERC, 2007 Google Scholar ). Not very far from Mentesh, on the right bank of the Kura River, the same team excavated kurgans at Soyuq Bulaq dating to this first half of the 4 th millennium, with one rather richly furnished with a copper knife, a stone scepter, lapis, gold and silver-copper beads. These kurgans are clearly related on the one hand to those of Sé Girdan on the south of Lake Urmia and on the other to those of the Maykop culture ( Lyonnet et al., 2008 109. Lyonnet, B. ∙ Akundov, T. ∙ Almamedov, K. ... Late Chalcolithic Kurgans in Transcaucasia. The cemetery of Soyuq Bulaq (Azerbaijan) Archäoligische Mitteilungen aus Iran und Turan. 2008; 40 :27-44 Google Scholar ), as well as to the Leilatepe culture.
Mentesh Tepe was abandoned during all this period and later only used for burials (period IV). A first kurgan was built for collective/ successive inhumations (at least 39 individuals) and used during the early phase of the Kura-Araxes culture in the second half of the 3 rd millennium BC. The kurgan was put to fire at the end, leaving the human bones in a very bad state of preservation ( Lyonnet, 2014; Poulmarc’h et al., 2014 106. Lyonnet, B. The Early Bronze Age in Azerbaijan in the light of recent discoveries Paéorient. 2014; 40 :115-130 Google Scholar 170. Poulmarc’h, M. ∙ Pecqueur, L. ∙ Jalilov, B. An Overview of Funerary Practices in the Southern Caucasus Paéorient. 2014; 40 :231-246 Google Scholar ). The site was possibly short-term occupied after that, until a second kurgan was built ca. 2500-2400 BCE, containing three individuals and a four-wheel cart. Its rather rich material – gold and carnelian beads and ring, an imported shell ring, spirals of tin-bronze, a silver small casket and a good amount of pottery – relate it to the Martkopi phase of the so-called Early Kurgan Culture ( Pecqueur et al., 2017 163. Pecqueur, L. ∙ Decaix, A. ∙ Lyonnet, B. Un kourgane de la phase Martkopi à Mentesh Tepe (Période des Premiers Kourganes, Bronze ancien) Helwing, B. ∙ Aliyev, T. ∙ Lyonnet, B. ... (Editors) The Kura Projects. New Research in the Later Prehistory of Southern Caucasus D. Reimer, 2017 Google Scholar ), a period when long distance connections develop ( Lyonnet, 2016 107.

Extensive genetic characterization of the Late Neolithic population of Mentesh Tepe is being conducted by CNRS UMR 7206/MNHN USM 104. Here, we analyzed one individual from the Late Neolithic collective burial of Mentesh Tepe which produced genome-wide data and was included in the genetic analyses. • ▪ MTT001 (Grave 342 20 7,12; Individual 1) is an immature individual aged between 10 and 14 years buried in the Late Neolithic collective grave. The skeleton, the last to be buried of a group of 30 individuals, was found lying face down with the legs twisted. In this collective grave, the imbrication of some of the skeletons tend to point at simultaneous inhumations, while a layer of sediment covers others indicating a possible lapse of time between them. The good bone preservation and their excavation by a group of anthropologists provided many details. They show a not natural distribution of sexes (more women than men) and ages (no infant less than one year, many immatures (65%)). For more details see Pecqueur and Jovenet (2017) 162.

Excavation: Mughan Neolitic-Eneolitic expedition of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, 2006-2017, directed by Tufan Isaak oglu Akhundov
The site of Polutepe is situated on the south coast of Injachay river, on the territory of Uchtepe village, in the Jalilabad district of Azerbaijan. It is a narrow belt (zone) of the eastern part of the Mughan steppe limited by the spurs of Brovary Range to the west and the Caspian Sea to the east. Presently, the settlement is represented by a 6-ha ashy hill of up to 6 m high. Its central part is occupied by the modern cemetery of Uchtepe village. Extensive excavations have revealed cultural layers of 7 m thick. The upper layer of the site’s deposits is 1 m thick and is represented by the remains of a Medieval settlement related to the IX-XI centuries CE. It is saturated with a large number of simple and glazed ceramics characteristic of the above-mentioned time.
The lower 6 m layer of cultural deposits of the settlement belongs to the Neolithic period. It contains various remains of Neolithic material culture characteristic of other Neolithic settlements of this region and which were defined by us as “Mughan Neolithic” culture. A large number of remains of ceramic utensils, bone and stone tools and other objects, burials of Neolithic inhabitants of this settlement, remains of different constructions from adobe and kilns for baking of ceramics were revealed in the different construction horizons of this layer. The greatest part of the excavated area represents a productive sector of the settlement and the revealed constructions are mainly represented by the remains of different round-planned, oval and rectangular barriers.
The unearthed burials of the settlement’s inhabitants included individuals of mixed sex and all age groups, from babies to old adults aged several dozen years. The burial rituals had been performed in shallow pits on different plots among the constructions. The deceased were placed in crouched position of different degrees. Often, they were covered by red ochre and were decorated with beads that were furnished by ceramic bowl. The lower horizons of the cultural layers revealed a cult hearth and more than two dozen small stylised female clay figures.
In the stretch between the Medieval and Neolithic layers ruins and separate findings of ceramics belonging to Kura-Araxes culture and different stages of the Middle Bronze Age have been revealed as well ( Akhundov, 2011; Akhundov et al., 2017 7.

One individual from Polutepe was analyzed for aDNA and is included in genetic analyses. • ▪ POT002 (Polutepe Burial N2) is an infant buried in a pit in a crouched position and the head orientated to the north-west. The burial was unearthed at 2.4 m depth from the Neolithic layer (approximately 10 m below the earth). The remains of the infant were very poorly preserved.

Tell Atchana is located at the southward bend of the Orontes River in the Amuq Valley in the modern state of Hatay, Turkey ( Yener, 2005, 2010 219. Yener, K.A.

(Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ) puts the foundation of the site in the terminal Early Bronze Age or the earliest Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2200-2000 BCE) and the abandonment of the city in the Late Bronze Age at ca. 1300 BCE, with an Iron Age re-occupation constituting Level O (ca. 1190-750 BCE). Three hundred and forty-two burials have been documented to date, although 151 of these were excavated in the initial excavations in the 1930s and 1940s, conducted by Sir Leonard Woolley ( Woolley, 1955 218. Woolley, C.L. Alalakh: An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana in the Hatay, 1937–1949 Oxford University Press, 1955 Google Scholar ), and the skeletal remains were not preserved. The remaining 180 graves have been discovered since 2003 as part of the renewed excavations directed by K. Aslıhan Yener. Of these, 134 were found in an extramural cemetery just outside the city fortification wall in Area 3 on the northeast slope of the mound ( Akar, 2017a; Ingman, 2017; Yener and Yazıcıoğlu, 2010 2.

Excavation Results Yener, K.A.

The overwhelming majority of the graves are single, simple pit burials, although multiple burials, cist graves, pot burials, secondary burials, and cremations have also been found in smaller numbers, as well as two constructed tombs, the Plastered Tomb in the extramural cemetery and the Shaft Grave in the Level VII (Middle Bronze II) palace ( Woolley, 1939, 1955 217.

Alalakh: An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana in the Hatay, 1937–1949 Oxford University Press, 1955 Google Scholar ). The preservation of the burials varies widely, with those in the extramural cemetery often badly preserved and heavily disturbed, due to proximity to topsoil, slope wash, and other post-depositional processes ( Akar, 2017a; Ingman, 2017 2. Akar, M. Late Middle Bronze Age International Connections: An Egyptian Style Kohl Pot from Alalakh Kozal, E. ∙ Akar, M. ∙ Heffron, Y. ...

(Editors) Overturning Certainties in Near Eastern Archaeology: A Festschrift in Honor of K. Aslıhan Yener Brill, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ) and those which are within the city walls typically much better preserved. Types and numbers of grave goods also varies with burial context, with grave goods being much rarer in the extramural cemetery, typically consisting of one or two ceramic vessels and perhaps a single piece of jewelry (typically either a metal pin or a beaded bracelet/necklace) ( Ingman, 2017 79. Ingman, T. The Extramural Cemetery at Tell Atchana, Ancient Alalakh and GIS Modeling Maner, Ç. ∙ Horowitz, M.T. ∙ Gilbert, A. (Editors) Overturning Certainties in Near Eastern Archaeology: A Festschrift in Honor of K. Aslıhan Yener Brill, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ). In the burials within the city, though, grave goods generally are much more numerous and varied ( Ingman, 2020 78. Ingman, T. Mortuary Practices and GIS Modeling at Tell Atchana, Alalakh Yener, K.A. (Editor) Alalakh and Its Neighbors: Proceedings of the 15th Anniversary Symposium at the New Hatay Archaeology Museum, June 10–12, 2015 Peeters, 2020 Google Scholar ).
Little is known about the city’s early history, given the very small areas exposed to date, but he material culture recovered belongs largely to the Northwest Syrian so-called Amorite horizon, including especially Syro-Cilician Ware ceramics ( Bulu, 2016, 2017; Heinz, 1992; Woolley, 1955 35.

Alalakh: An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana in the Hatay, 1937–1949 Oxford University Press, 1955 Google Scholar ). Sometime during this period, Alalakh and Mukish became subservient to the Amorite kingdom of Yamhad, based in Aleppo, and the kings of Alalakh had close familial ties to the kings of Yamhad ( Klengel, 1992; Lauinger, 2015 90.

Following the Man of Yamhad: Settlement and Territory at Old Babylonian Alalah Brill, 2015 Crossref Google Scholar ). Most of our understanding of Middle Bronze Age Alalakh comes from the end of the period, in Period 7, where a large palace with an archive and an attached temple, as well as a tripartite city gate, the city’s fortification wall, and another potential temple have been found ( Woolley, 1955; Yener, 2015a, 2015b 218.

(Editors) NOSTOI: Indigenous Culture, Migration + Integration in the Aegean Islands + Western Anatolian During the Late Bronze + Early Iron Ages Koç University Press, 2015 Google Scholar ). This period marks the first real evidence of a nascent internationalism at Alalakh ( Akar, 2017a 2. Akar, M. Late Middle Bronze Age International Connections: An Egyptian Style Kohl Pot from Alalakh Kozal, E. ∙ Akar, M. ∙ Heffron, Y. ... (Editors) Questions, Approaches, and Dialogues in Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology Studies in Honor of Marie-Henriette and Charles Gates Ugarit-Verlag, 2017 Google Scholar ), and it ends with a large-scale fire that burned the Royal Precinct ( Klengel, 1992; Woolley, 1955 90. Klengel, H. Syria: 3000 to 300 B.C. A Handbook of Political History Akademie Verlag, 1992 Google Scholar 218. Woolley, C.L. Alalakh: An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana in the Hatay, 1937–1949 Oxford University Press, 1955 Google Scholar ), often attributed to the Hittite king Hattušili I in the course of his campaigns into Syria against Yamhad ( Bryce, 2005 33. Bryce, T. The Kingdom of the Hittites Oxford University Press, 2005 Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar ). Although the precise date of the Period 7 destruction has not yet been fixed, it marks a shift in material culture and is therefore taken as the end of the Middle Bronze age at the site, ca. 1650 BCE.
The succeeding Late Bronze I, consisting of Periods 6-4 at Tell Atchana, can generally be described as having a Hurrian/Mitannian character. This period is unclear not only at Tell Atchana, but also across Syria more generally: the destruction of Aleppo and the kingdom of Yamhad by the Hittites, accomplished shortly after the destruction of Alalakh, was followed by their destruction of Babylon ( Bryce, 2005; Klengel, 1992 33. Bryce, T. The Kingdom of the Hittites Oxford University Press, 2005 Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar 90. Klengel, H. Syria: 3000 to 300 B.C. A Handbook of Political History Akademie Verlag, 1992 Google Scholar ), ending the Amorite kingdoms and apparently causing no small amount of chaos in the region ( Akkermans and Schwartz, 2003 11. Akkermans, P.M.M. ∙ Schwartz, G.M. The Archaeology of Syria: From Complex Hunter-Gatherers to Early Urban Societies (c. 16,000-300 BC) Cambridge University Press, 2003 Google Scholar ). By the early fifteenth century BCE, however, the kingdom of Mitanni, based at Washukanni in the Upper Khabur (identified as Tell el Fekheriye) ( Bartl and Bonatz, 2013 24. Bartl, P.V. ∙ Bonatz, D. Across Assyria’s Northern Frontier: Tell Fekheriye at the End of the Late Bronze Age Yener, K.A. (Editor) Across the Border Peeters, 2013 Google Scholar ) had emerged from the territories once controlled by Yamhad ( Akkermans and Schwartz, 2003 11. Akkermans, P.M.M. ∙ Schwartz, G.M. The Archaeology of Syria: From Complex Hunter-Gatherers to Early Urban Societies (c. 16,000-300 BC) Cambridge University Press, 2003 Google Scholar ), and Alalakh became a vassal to this new regional power. This period is most well-documented in Period 4 at the site, which is characterized by a palace with archives documenting a Hurrian-style class system and many Hurrian names ( von Dassow, 2008 208. von Dassow, E. State and Society in the Late Bronze Age: Alalaḫ Under the Mittani Empire CDL Press, 2008 Google Scholar ), a temple, and other administrative buildings, such as Woolley’s Level IV Castle ( Woolley, 1955 218. Woolley, C.L. Alalakh: An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana in the Hatay, 1937–1949 Oxford University Press, 1955 Google Scholar ). The material culture of Late Bronze I shows affinities with the Hurrian world to the east, such as Nuzi Ware ( Woolley, 1955; Yener et al., 2019 218. Woolley, C.L. Alalakh: An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana in the Hatay, 1937–1949 Oxford University Press, 1955 Google Scholar 227. Yener, K.A. ∙ Akar, M. ∙ Horowitz, M.T. (Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ), as well as strong contacts with other, more far-flung regions, such as Cyprus ( Woolley, 1955; Yener et al., 2019 218. Woolley, C.L. Alalakh: An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana in the Hatay, 1937–1949 Oxford University Press, 1955 Google Scholar 227. Yener, K.A. ∙ Akar, M. ∙ Horowitz, M.T. (Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ). This period, like Period 7, ends with a site-wide burning ca. 1400 BCE that may be associated with Tudhaliya II ( Akar, 2019 4. Akar, M. Excavation Results Yener, K.A. ∙ Akar, M. ∙ Horowitz, M.T. (Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ).
Late Bronze II, Periods 3-1, represents the last stages of Mitanni vassalhood (Period 3) and the take-over of the city by the Hittites and its incorporation into their empire (Periods 2-1) ( Yener, 2013a; Yener et al., 2019 222.

(Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ). The major construction in this period were the Northern and Southern Fortresses in Period 2 ( Akar, 2013, 2019 1. Akar, M.

(Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ), which blend characteristics of Egyptian and Hittite defensive architecture. The scale of the construction projects, the unusual building techniques, and the hints of possible Hittite administration from this period, in the form of grain distribution tablets from probable late Period 3/early Period 2 contexts ( von Dassow, 2005 207. von Dassow, E. Archives of Alalah IV in Archaeological Context Bull. Am. Schools Orient. Res. 2005; 338 :1-69 Crossref Google Scholar ), all suggest that Hittite Great King Suppiluliuma I took over the site, installing a vassal to rule as governor [perhaps the Tudhaliya depicted on the basalt orthostat found by Woolley in the Level Ib temple; ( Woolley, 1955 218. Woolley, C.L. Alalakh: An Account of the Excavations at Tell Atchana in the Hatay, 1937–1949 Oxford University Press, 1955 Google Scholar ) and that either the king or his governor initiated the Fortresses’ construction ( Yener et al., 2019 227. Yener, K.A. ∙ Akar, M. ∙ Horowitz, M.T. (Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ). The arrival of the Hittites is also visible in the material culture of the site at this time, with the introduction of several types of North Central Anatolian (NCA) ceramics, typical of the Hittite homeland ( Akar, 2017b; Horowitz, 2015, 2019 3.

Muhly INSTAP Academic Press, 2011 Crossref Google Scholar ). Contacts with the Aegean world apparently increased, judging from the large quantities of Mycenaean wares found in these periods, and the Mitannian Nuzi Ware developed into a local style termed Atchana Ware which also continues to be found in great numbers ( Yener et al., 2019 227. Yener, K.A. ∙ Akar, M. ∙ Horowitz, M.T. (Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ). The Late Bronze II occupation ends ca. 1300 BCE, when the city was abandoned, except for the temple and perhaps several buildings around it, which continued in use into the mid-13th century BCE ( Yener, 2013a; Yener et al., 2019 222.

(Editors) Tell Atchana, Alalakh: The Late Bronze II City. 2006-2010 Excavation Seasons Koç University Press, 2019 Google Scholar ). Early Iron Age ceramics date partial architectural remains to the mid-twelfth century BCE, testifying to a small-scale re-settlement in this period ( Montesanto, 2020; Pucci, 2020; Yener, 2013a 142.

Another structure dating to Iron II has also recently been identified above the Northern Fortress, demonstrating that small-scale occupation continued, at least sporadically, at Tell Atchana, even while the main settlement moved to Tell Tayinat, the Iron Age capital of the area, only 713 m away ( Yener, 2013a 222.

A total of 26 individuals from Alalakh produced genome-wide data and are included in genetic analyses. • ▪ ALA001 (Square 45.71, Locus 03-3017, Pail 257, Skeleton 04-9), Burial 4 in the Plastered Tomb ( Yener, 2013b 223. Yener, K.A. A Plaster Encased Multiple Burial at Alalakh: Cist Tomb 3017. Amilla: The Quest for Excellence. Studies in Honor of Günter Kopcke on the Occasion of his 75 Birthday INSTAP Academic Press, 2013 Google Scholar ) in the Area 3 extramural cemetery, is the adult man (auricular age estimation of 40-45 years old) ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) in the bottom layer of this tomb. The remains exhibit the presence of Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH), a joint disease characterized by the formation of new bone in the shape of flowing melted wax found on the right side of thoracic vertebrae 4-10. DISH etiology is unclear, but it is believed to be related to obesity and diabetes ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ). Several of the joints and vertebrae exhibit signs of degenerative joint disease in the form of marginal osteophytes and enthesophytes ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ). Examination of the dentition exhibited two episodes of dental enamel hypoplasia correlating to the ages of 1.9/2.1 years and 4.5/4.7 years old, thus indicating two health disturbances that occurred during childhood growth periods ( Hillson, 2014 73. Hillson, S. Tooth Development in Human Evolution and Bioarchaeology Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar ). A piece of plaster had been inserted into his mouth. His head was propped up with an s-curve jar, and in the area of his torso and pelvis were found seven bronze pins and a silver toggle pin. Eight gold appliques stamped with rosettes were around his head and chest, and a gold foil was to the left of his head. A Cypriot Base Ring I jug was along the southeast wall of the tomb and another was near his right forearm; two spindle bottles (one Red Lustrous Wheelmade Ware and one locally made in Red Burnished Ware) were found, one placed in the south corner of the tomb and one at his left elbow; a Syrian Brown-Grey Burnished Ware cylindrical cup was in crook of his right arm and another was found just above his left elbow; and, a Red Slipped narrow-necked jug was along the southwest wall of the tomb. An amber pendant was found on his legs, along with a bone spindle whorl, several pieces of chert, and beads of carnelian, bone, faience, and glass were also discovered with the body. Two haunches of beef had been placed near his left arm and left femur, and a caprid molar was also found with his remains, indicating that food had been deposited with him. This is the single richest assemblage of grave goods ever found with an individual at Tell Atchana. Dating of human bone: 1496-1325 cal BCE (3151 ± 24 BP, MAMS-33675). • ▪ ALA002 (Square 45.71, Locus 03-3017, Pail 246, Skeleton 04-8), Burial 2 in the Plastered Tomb ( Yener, 2013b 223. Yener, K.A. A Plaster Encased Multiple Burial at Alalakh: Cist Tomb 3017. Amilla: The Quest for Excellence. Studies in Honor of Günter Kopcke on the Occasion of his 75 Birthday INSTAP Academic Press, 2013 Google Scholar ) in the Area 3 extramural cemetery, is the young adult male (age estimation of 19-21 years based on the different degrees of epiphyseal plates fusion) ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ) in the top layer of this tomb. The orbital bones exhibit cribra orbitalia , along with porotic hyperostosis on both parietal bones located medially along the coronal suture, indicating the body’s response to a pathological condition ( Rothschild, 2002 182. Rothschild, B. Porotic hyperostosis as a marker of health and nutritional conditions Am. J. Hum. Biol. 2002; 14 :417-418, discussion 418–420 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both humeri have the non-metric trait of Septal Aperture ( Barnes, 2012 23. Barnes, E. Atlas of Developmental Field Anomalies of the Human Skeleton: A Paleopathology Perspective John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2012 Crossref Google Scholar ). A vertical bone had been placed inside his mouth. Six bronze pins were found around his torso, along with a bone needle. Several gold appliques stamped with rosettes (one with red pigment preserved on the stamped side) were found near his head, and he was wearing an in situ necklace of alternating gold, carnelian, and vitreous white beads. Additional beads of the same materials were also found with this individual. A gold ring was found in situ on his left thumb. Several clay pellets and pieces of chert, as well as two lumps of vitrified material (one placed under his chin), were also found with this individual. Dating of human bone: 1496-1401 cal BCE (3158 ± 22 BP, MAMS-33676). • ▪ ALA004 (Square 45.72, Locus 03-3002, Pail 40, Skeleton 04-25) is an adult male (age estimated as 40-45 years old) ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) found in a bone scatter that likely represents a disturbed primary burial in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. The remains are half complete and mixed with other individuals’ remains. Both fibulae and the right tibia all exhibit well-healed Periostitis (indicating an episode of infection or trauma) along the medial shafts ( Mann and Hunt, 2005 111. Mann, R. ∙ Hunt, D. Photographic Regional Atlas of Bone Disease: A Guide to Pathologic and Normal Variation in the Human Skeleton Charles C. Thomas, 2005 Google Scholar ). Marginal osteophytes and enthesopathy are found on the pelvis and left shoulder ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ), a condition that is typical of old age. The skull exhibits a well-healed trauma located on the left side of the frontal bone ( Byers, 2011 37. Byers, S. Introduction to Forensic Anthropology Pearson, 2011 Google Scholar ). No grave goods were recovered. Dating of human bone: 1895-1752 cal BCE (3507 ± 23 BP, MAMS-33677). • ▪ ALA008 (Square 45.44, Locus 133, AT 17652) is represented by an adult skull (with features indicating a male, age estimation of 25-35 years) ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) and several finger bones, although the simple pit grave continued into the east baulk, in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. No grave goods were found. Dating of human bone: 1881-1700 cal BCE (3473 ± 23 BP, MAMS-33678). • ▪ ALA011 (Square 45.44, Locus 146, AT 18960) is a child (3.5-4 years old) ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ) buried in a simple pit grave inside a casemate within the Area 3 fortification wall ( Ingman, 2017 79. Ingman, T. The Extramural Cemetery at Tell Atchana, Ancient Alalakh and GIS Modeling Maner, Ç. ∙ Horowitz, M.T. ∙ Gilbert, A. (Editors) Overturning Certainties in Near Eastern Archaeology: A Festschrift in Honor of K. Aslıhan Yener Brill, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ; unpublished data). Only the legs and feet were within the square, as the grave extended into the north baulk. A Simple Fine Ware shoulder goblet was found in the baulk near the child’s pelvis. Dating of human bone: 1741-1624 cal BCE (3382 ± 23 BP, MAMS-33680). • ▪ ALA013 (Square 45.44, Locus 152, AT 19260) is an infant (dental age of 1.5-2 years old) ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ) found in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. Age estimation based on skeletal long bone growth gave an age of 6-8 months ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ), thus indicating that the child had stunted growth of around 1 year. The upper first molars exhibit the dental morphology feature of Carabelli’s cusp ( Scott and Irish, 2017 194. Scott, G. ∙ Irish, J. Human Tooth Crown and Root Morphology: The Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System Cambridge University Press, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ). A bronze ring and a silver ring, two beaded necklaces, a Simple Ware biconical cup (at the left elbow), a Simple Ware globular juglet (at the left side of the pelvis), a Simple Ware short-neck jar (at the left elbow), and a piece of lead wire were found. Dating of human bone: 1878-1693 cal BCE (3457 ± 24 BP, MAMS-33681). • ▪ ALA014 (Square 45.45, Loci 8 and 9, AT 8836) is an adult (age estimation of 35-55 years) ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) found in a simple pit grave in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. There were no grave goods. Dating of human bone: 1743-1630 cal BCE (3392 ± 23 BP, MAMS-33682). • ▪ ALA015 (Square 45.45, Loci 18 and 19, AT 15741) is an adult found in the Area 3 extramural cemetery in a simple pit grave. A shell pendant was found in the grave. Dating of human bone: 2014-1781 BCE (3566 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33683). • ▪ ALA016 (Square 32.54, Locus 85, AT 17541) is an adult female (age estimation of 65-75 years old) ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) buried in a simple pit grave in a temporarily abandoned building in the Royal Precinct below a subsequent floor. The skeletal remains exhibit evidence of degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis - OA) found on the majority of the joints, such as knees and hand phalanges, with eburnation ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ). Vertebrae joints exhibited fusion, in addition to OA, with the cervical 7 and thoracic 1-4 all fused. There is the rare presence of adventitious bursa on lumbar 4 and 5 ( Kwong et al., 2011 93. Kwong, Y. ∙ Rao, N. ∙ Latief, K. MDCT findings in Baastrup disease: disease or normal feature of the aging spine? AJR Am. J. Roentgenol. 2011; 196 :1156-1159 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The frontal bone exhibited hyperostosis frontalis interna on the ventral surface ( Roberts and Manchester, 1995 179. Roberts, C. ∙ Manchester, K. The Archaeology of Disease Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, 1995 Google Scholar ). Examination of the dentition showed two episodes of dental enamel hypoplasia correlating to the ages of 2.8/3.1 years and 4.2/4.9 years old ( Hillson, 2014 73. Hillson, S. Tooth Development in Human Evolution and Bioarchaeology Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar ), thus indicating two health disturbances that had occurred during childhood growth periods. A bronze pin was next to the skull, and several bone and vitreous beads were in the area of the neck. Dating of human bone: 1617-1506 cal BCE (3566 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33683). • ▪ ALA017 (Square 32.57, Loci 160 and 164, AT 10070) is a young adult female (dental age of 17-25 years old) ( Brothwell, 1981 31. Brothwell, D.R. Digging up Bones: the Excavation, Treatment and Study of Human Skeletal Remains Cornell University Press, 1981 Google Scholar ) buried in a simple pit burial dug into a street in the Royal Precinct. Only the top of the skull was found within the excavation area, as the rest of the burial extended into the east baulk. The nuchal crest is score 4, as a male ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ), thus indicating the use of the neck muscles for caring heavy material, possibly on the head. The upper first molars exhibit the dental morphology feature of Carabelli’s cusp ( Scott and Irish, 2017 194. Scott, G. ∙ Irish, J. Human Tooth Crown and Root Morphology: The Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System Cambridge University Press, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ). The skull and the deposit above it were both burnt, likely as a result of a post-deposition burning episode unrelated to the burial. Three Grey Burnished Ware vessels (a narrow-necked jug, a long-necked globular juglet, and an omphalos bowl) were grouped above the head, and a conch shell pendant was also recovered from the burial. Dating of human bone: 1614-1466 cal BCE (3264 ± 23 BP, MAMS-33685). • ▪ ALA018 (Square 42.29, Locus 44, AT 19127) is a child (dental aged at 4.5-5.5 years) buried in a simple pit grave in an accumulation fill not far outside the Royal Precinct. Skeletal growth gave the age estimation of 3.5-4 years ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ), thus indicating a stunted growth by around 1 year. Examination of the dentition exhibited two episodes of dental enamel hypoplasia correlating to the ages of 1.5/1.7 years and 2.0/2.3 years old ( Hillson, 2014 73. Hillson, S. Tooth Development in Human Evolution and Bioarchaeology Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar ), thus indicating two health disturbances during childhood growth periods. A string of vitreous beads was around the neck, a Nuzi Ware goblet was behind the feet, and an astragalus was also found in the grave. Dating of human bone: 1497-1326 cal BCE (3154 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33686). • ▪ ALA019 (Square 32.57, Locus 247, AT 15878) is an adult female aged 40-45 years old ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) found at the bottom of a very deep well [hence, dubbed “the Well Lady”; (Shafiq, 2020)]. The remains exhibit presence of osteoarthritis with eburnation (OA) on the cervical vertebrae between C1 and C2 ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ), along with the rare presence of adventitious bursa ( Kwong et al., 2011 93. Kwong, Y. ∙ Rao, N. ∙ Latief, K. MDCT findings in Baastrup disease: disease or normal feature of the aging spine? AJR Am. J. Roentgenol. 2011; 196 :1156-1159 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) on lumbar 3 and 4. The individual shows evidence of healed trauma on the frontal bone of the skull ( Byers, 2011 37. Byers, S. Introduction to Forensic Anthropology Pearson, 2011 Google Scholar ) and two healed fractured ribs ( Shafiq, 2020 196. Shafiq, R. Come and Hear My Story: The ‘Well-Lady’ of Alalakh Yener, K.A. ∙ Ingman, T. (Editors) Alalakh and its Neighbors: Proceedings of the 15th Anniversary Symposium at the New Hatay Archaeology Museum, June 10–12, 2015 Peeters, 2020 Google Scholar ). Enthesophytes were found on both calcaneal bones ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ). The upper lateral incisors exhibit the dental morphology feature of shoveling, score 5 ( Scott and Irish, 2017 194. Scott, G. ∙ Irish, J. Human Tooth Crown and Root Morphology: The Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System Cambridge University Press, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ). Her dentition exhibited multiple episodes of dental enamel hypoplasia, starting from 1.3 years old up to 4.6 years old, with a total of twelve childhood growth disturbances (correlating to the ages of 1.3/1.5, 1.7/1.8, 1.9/2.0, 2.0/2.3, 2.6/2.8, 2.7/3.0, 2.8/3.1, 3.1/3.4, 3.5/3.7, 3.7/4.2, and 4.0/4.4-4.6 years old) ( Hillson, 2014 73. Hillson, S. Tooth Development in Human Evolution and Bioarchaeology Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar ). She was discovered facedown with her limbs splayed, indicating that she had been carelessly thrown into the well while it was still in use (probably for domestic/craft purposes or for animals). As this individual’s deposition was the result of misadventure, rather than deliberate burial, there are no accompanying grave goods. Dating of human bone: 1625-1511 BCE (3298 ± 23 BP, MAMS-33687). • ▪ ALA020 (Square 44.86, Loci 18 and 22, AT 15460) is a young adult female (age estimation of 25-35 years old) ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) buried in a simple pit grave dug into a debris layer in Area 2, although bones of another individual, a male, based on the pelvic features, were mixed into the debris. The frontal bones exhibit cribra orbitalia , indicating a stressful health condition at the time of death ( Rothschild, 2002 182. Rothschild, B. Porotic hyperostosis as a marker of health and nutritional conditions Am. J. Hum. Biol. 2002; 14 :417-418, discussion 418–420 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). The dentition exhibits dental enamel hypoplasia occurred at the ages of 1.7/1.8 and 2.2/2.4-2.7 ( Hillson, 2014 73. Hillson, S. Tooth Development in Human Evolution and Bioarchaeology Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar ). No grave goods were found. Dating of human bone: 1502-1395 BCE (3167 ± 29 BP, MAMS-33688). • ▪ ALA023 (Square 45.44, Locus 65, AT 6029) is a child (dental age of 6.5-7 years) ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ) in a simple pit grave -part of a cluster of three burials in the Area 3 extramural cemetery (with ALA025 and Locus 67)- whose skull was placed directly over that of ALA025. The skull exhibits the non-metric feature of Apical Bone on the occipital bone ( Barnes, 2012 23. Barnes, E. Atlas of Developmental Field Anomalies of the Human Skeleton: A Paleopathology Perspective John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2012 Crossref Google Scholar ). A lead ring was found in the fill above the remains. Dating of human bone: 1921-1763 BCE (3520 ± 25 BP, MAMS-38610). • ▪ ALA024 (Square 45.44, Locus 68, AT 6572) is a child (2-3 years old) ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ) in a simple pit grave in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. A Simple Ware short-neck jar was found above her head. Dating of human bone: 2111-1779 BCE (3586 ± 39 BP, MAMS-33690). • ▪ ALA025 (Square 45.44, Locus 66, AT 6032) is an adolescent female aged 13-14 years old in a simple pit grave directly under ALA023 in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. The skeletal growth of long bones gives an age of 11 years old ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ), indicating stunted growth of two years. The frontal bones exhibit cribra orbitalia ( Rothschild, 2002 182. Rothschild, B. Porotic hyperostosis as a marker of health and nutritional conditions Am. J. Hum. Biol. 2002; 14 :417-418, discussion 418–420 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the healing process at the time of death. Dentition exhibit two health disturbances, with dental enamel hypoplasia at the ages of 3.3/3.4 and 4.3/4.8 years ( Hillson, 2014 73. Hillson, S. Tooth Development in Human Evolution and Bioarchaeology Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar ). A Simple Fine Ware short-neck jar was placed on her crossed arms. Dating of human bone: 1877-1686 BCE (3443 ± 25 BP, MAMS-33691). • ▪ ALA026 (Square 45.44, Locus 70, AT 6931) is a child aged 3.5-4 years in a simple pit burial in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. However, the skeletal age gives 2.5 years ( Schaefer et al., 2009 185. Schaefer, M. ∙ Black, S. ∙ Scheuer, L. Juvenile Osteology: a Laboratory and Field Manual Academic, 2009 Google Scholar ), indicating in stunted growth of 1 year. A Syrian Brown-Grey Burnished Ware piriform juglet was placed near the mandible. Dating of human bone: 1744-1628 BCE (3390 ± 25 BP, MAMS-33692). • ▪ ALA028 (Square 45.44, Locus 73, AT 7395) is an adult female aged 30-40 years old ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) represented by disarticulated remains in simple pit grave in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. This grave was directly above the pit grave of ALA029, with the pelvis of ALA028 resting on the skull of ALA029. This burial likely represents a primary burial that was disturbed; the disturbed remains were collected and then reburied. No grave goods were found. Dating of human bone: 1877-1666 BCE (3440 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33693). • ▪ ALA029 (Square 45.44, Locus 79, AT 7695) is an adult female aged 20-30 years old ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) represented by the skull in a simple pit grave directly below ALA028. The skull was partially crushed by the pelvis of ALA028, which rested directly on top of it. Although the majority of the bones were in anatomical position, the grave was clearly reopened/disturbed in antiquity, as both femurs had been turned upside-down. This may have occurred at the same time as ALA028’s burial. A Simple Ware short-neck jar was under her chin, a Syrian Brown-Grey Burnished Ware piriform juglet was behind her skull, and a toggle pin was found during screening. Dating of human bone: 1880-1695 BCE (3465 ± 26 BP, MAMS-33694). • ▪ ALA030 (Square 45.44, Locus 105, AT 10669) is an adult female, aged 30-35 years old ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ), who seems to have been killed during the destruction of the building next to the fortification wall in Area 3. The remains indicate a rather small-sized female, with a collapsed vertebra body of L1 ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ) on the left side of the vertebral body, a possible case of carrying heavy weights, along with bone growth on lower thoracic T11 and T12. The left shoulder exhibit a condition of osteochondritis dissecanus , a joint pathology ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ). Both humeri exhibit the non-metric trait of Septal Aperture ( Barnes, 2012 23. Barnes, E. Atlas of Developmental Field Anomalies of the Human Skeleton: A Paleopathology Perspective John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2012 Crossref Google Scholar ). The upper incisors show the dental morphology feature of shoveling ( Scott and Irish, 2017 194. Scott, G. ∙ Irish, J. Human Tooth Crown and Root Morphology: The Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System Cambridge University Press, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ). Evidence of six health disturbances during the growth period are visible as dental enamel hypoplasia at the ages of 1.3/1.5, 1.7/2.0, 1.9/2.1, 2.6/2.8, 2.8/3.1, and 3.2/3.3 years ( Hillson, 2014 73. Hillson, S. Tooth Development in Human Evolution and Bioarchaeology Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar ). Found in a burnt room context, she was discovered on her back with her arms pulled up to her chin and her legs disappearing into the west baulk. Because this individual met with her death, and was subsequently buried, by misadventure, there were no grave goods. Dating of human bone: 1612-1457 BCE (3256 ± 25 BP, MAMS-33695). • ▪ ALA034 (Square 45.45, Locus 6, AT 8830) is an adult female aged between 25-35 years old ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) whose simple pit grave in the Area 3 extramural cemetery remains mostly within the west baulk. No grave goods were found. Dating of human bone: 1874-1666 BCE (3436 ± 24 BP, MAMS-33696). • ▪ ALA035 (Square 45.45, Locus 7, AT 7940) is an adult male aged between 25-35 years old ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) whose remains were found in the Area 3 extramural cemetery in a simple pit containing the dense and highly disarticulated remains of three other adults (two males and one female). ALA035 appears to have been a primary burial, and the remains of the three other adults were likely redeposited with this individual after having been disturbed. The lower limbs, femur, and tibia exhibit periostitis along the shafts ( Mann and Hunt, 2005 111. Mann, R. ∙ Hunt, D. Photographic Regional Atlas of Bone Disease: A Guide to Pathologic and Normal Variation in the Human Skeleton Charles C. Thomas, 2005 Google Scholar ), and joint disease of the scapula was also identified ( Waldron, 2001 211. Waldron, T. Shadows in the Soil: Human Bones and Archaeology Tempus Publishing, 2001 Google Scholar ). There is one line of dental enamel hypoplasia at the age of 1.9/2.1 years old ( Hillson, 2014 73. Hillson, S. Tooth Development in Human Evolution and Bioarchaeology Cambridge University Press, 2014 Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar ). No grave goods were found. Dating of human bone: 1948-1774 BCE (3542 ± 24 BP, MAMS-33697). • ▪ ALA037 (Square 45.45, Loci 30 and 31, AT 11452) is a concentration of bones containing the disturbed remains of multiple individuals in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. The long bones are oriented northeast-southwest, parallel to the slope of the mound in this area, which may be the result of post-depositional slope wash or deliberate secondary repositioning. Given the high degree of disturbance in this area generally due to post-depositional processes ( Ingman, 2017 79. Ingman, T. The Extramural Cemetery at Tell Atchana, Ancient Alalakh and GIS Modeling Maner, Ç. ∙ Horowitz, M.T. ∙ Gilbert, A. (Editors) Overturning Certainties in Near Eastern Archaeology: A Festschrift in Honor of K. Aslıhan Yener Brill, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ), the former is perhaps more likely. No grave goods were found. Dating of human bone: 1882-1701 BCE (3477 ± 24 BP, MAMS-33698). • ▪ ALA038 (Square 45.71, Locus 03-3017, Pail 236, Skeleton 09-07), Burial 1 in the Plastered Tomb ( Yener, 2013b 223. Yener, K.A. A Plaster Encased Multiple Burial at Alalakh: Cist Tomb 3017. Amilla: The Quest for Excellence. Studies in Honor of Günter Kopcke on the Occasion of his 75 Birthday INSTAP Academic Press, 2013 Google Scholar ) in the Area 3 extramural cemetery is an adult female (aged 35-45 years old) ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) in the top layer of this grave and the final individual deposited in the tomb. Both humeri exhibit the non-metric trait of Septal Aperture ( Barnes, 2012 23. Barnes, E. Atlas of Developmental Field Anomalies of the Human Skeleton: A Paleopathology Perspective John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2012 Crossref Google Scholar ). Although, this burial was disturbed, probably due to its proximity to the topsoil, in the area of her head and torso were found several bronze pins, as well as beads made of gold, metal, amber, and stone. Two Simple Ware bottle jugs were placed with her, one atop her torso and one along her left femur, and two Simple Ware globular pitchers were found, one near her skull and one at her right hip. A Simple Ware lamp was under the right side of her pelvis. A cattle humerus and a sheep haunch were above the right side of her pelvis, indicating that food offerings were deposited with this individual. Dating of human bone: 1613-1461 cal BCE (3260 ± 24 BP, MAMS-33699). • ▪ ALA039 (Square 44.85, Locus 15, AT 14466) is represented by a skull of an adult female aged 50-60 years old ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ) and was placed upright with a human pelvis (presumably belonging to the same individual, but this is uncertain) next to it. These remains were found in a simple pit dug into an accumulation layer with tandırs and trash pits in Area 2. The skull shows evidence of blunt trauma located on the right parietal bone in a circular shape, with the bones fractured ventrally. There are no radiating fracture lines and no signs of healing, termed perimortem. The fracture size measures 16.2 × 15.3 mm with a depth inside the bone of 2.5 mm, suggesting that this was most probably the cause of death, indicating a violent death ( Byers, 2011 37. Byers, S. Introduction to Forensic Anthropology Pearson, 2011 Google Scholar ). Under the skull was a chunk of iron oxide. This is likely a secondary burial, given the iron oxide and the non-random positioning of the skull, but it could also have been disturbed from an unpreserved (or as-yet-undiscovered) grave. Dating of human bone: 1448-1303 BCE (3125 ± 24 BP, MAMS-33700). • ▪ ALA084 (Square 45.72, Locus 03-3065, Skeleton 04-19) is an adult female aged 25-30 years ( Haas et al., 1994 34. Haas, J. ∙ Buikstra, J.E. ∙ Ubelaker, D.H. ..., Field Museum of Natural History Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains: Proceedings of a Seminar at the Field Museum of Natural History, Organized by Jonathan Haas Arkansas Archaeological Survey, 1994 Google Scholar ), buried in a simple pit grave in the Area 3 extramural cemetery. The ventral surface of the occipital, parietal, and frontal bones all exhibit meningeal reaction, indicating a case of infection or trauma ( Schultz, 2003 193. Schultz, M. Light Microscopic Analysis in Skeletal Paleopathology Ortner, D. (Editor) Identification of Pathological Conditions in Human Skeletal Remains Academic Press, 2003 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and porotic hyperostosis was also observed ( Rothschild, 2002 182.

No grave goods were found. Dating of human tooth: 2006-1777 BCE (3556 ± 25 BP, MAMS-41108). • ▪ ALA095 (45.72, L03-3013/3016, pail 54) is represented by a tooth that was part of a heap of bones and teeth from a minimum of three individuals (2 mature and 1 immature) lying on top of a single pit grave of an adult male from the Area 3 extramural cemetery. No grave goods were found. Dating of human tooth: 1913-1756 BCE (3516 ± 25 BP, MAMS-41109)

Excavation: Italian Expedition of the Sapienza University of Rome (Missione Archeologica Italiana in Siria - MAIS), 1964-2010, directed by Paolo Matthiae
Tell Mardikh, ancient Ebla is an archaeological site located in the Idlib Governorate, 56 km southwest of Aleppo, on the limestone plateau of Northern Syria. The excavations revealed a long occupation sequence, spanning from at least Early Bronze Age III until the Iron Age, with later occupation or frequentation in the Hellenistic/Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader Periods (for an overview, see Matthiae, 2010 130. Matthiae, P. Ebla la città del trono. Archeologia e storia, Torino, Piccola Biblioteca Einaudi, 2010 492 Google Scholar ).
Although stray archaeological materials dating from the Chalcolithic period were found at Ebla, the earliest settlement uncovered thus far at Tell Mardikh dates from Early Bronze III (ca. 2750/2700-2550 BCE) and is represented by the remains of non-residential structures with facilities for crop storage uncovered on the Acropolis Italian Expedition of the Sapienza University of Rome ( Matthiae, 1993b; Mazzoni, 1991; Vacca, 2015 124. Matthiae, P. On this Side of the Euphrates. A Note on the Urban Origins in Inner Syria Frangipane, M. ∙ Hauptmann, H. ∙ Liverani, M. ... (Editors) Between the Rivers and Over the Mountains.

The Stratigraphic and Pottery Sequence of the West Unit of the Central Complex: The Building G5 Studia Eblaitica. 2015; 1 :1-32 Google Scholar ). This evidence documents a formative phase of urbanisation that puts the developmental trajectory of Ebla in line with the development of other archaeological site in western inland Syria, such as Hama and Qatna, and with neighboring regional areas, such as the Middle Euphrates Valley and the Jazirah ( Vacca, 2015 205. Vacca, A. Before the Royal Palace G. The Stratigraphic and Pottery Sequence of the West Unit of the Central Complex: The Building G5 Studia Eblaitica. 2015; 1 :1-32 Google Scholar ).
The process toward increasing social, economic, and political complexity continued during the initial stage of Early Bronze IVA (ca. 2550-2450 BC) ( Vacca, 2014–2015, 2015 206. Vacca, A. Recherches sur les périodes pré-et proto-palatiale d’Ébla au Bronze ancient III-IVA1 Matthiae, P. ∙ Abdulkarim, M. ∙ Pinnock, F. ... (Editors) Studies on the History and Archaeology of Ebla after 50 Years of Discoveries, Damas Les annals archéologiques arabes syriennes, 2014–2015 Google Scholar ). It culminated, in the developed phase of the Early Bronze IVA (ca. 2450-2300 BCE), in the formation of an archaic state ruled by Ebla ( Matthiae, 2013b 133. Matthiae, P. A Long Journey. Fifty Years of Research on the Bronze Age at Tell Mardikh Matthiae, P. ∙ Marchetti, N. (Editors) Ebla and Its Landscape. Early State Formation in the Ancient Near East Left Coast Press, 2013 Google Scholar ), documented by the archives of cuneiform tablets discovered in the destruction layer of the Royal Palace B dating from this period. It is estimated that the territory controlled by Ebla extended from around Hama, to the south, to Karkemish, to the north. At this time, Ebla had diplomatic and commercial relationships with equivalent kingdoms located along the Euphrates River Valley, in Upper Syria and in Upper Mesopotamia, as well as with Byblos and with Egypt. A fierce destruction put an end to this flourishing phase ( Matthiae, 2009a 128. Matthiae, P. Crisis and Collapse: Similarity and Diversity in the Three Destructions of Ebla from EB IVA to MB II Scienze dell’Antichità. 2009; 15 :165-204 Google Scholar ), which is placed in the interval between 2367 and 2297 cal BCE by the average weight of available radiometric determinations ( Calcagnile et al., 2013 38. Calcagnile, L. ∙ Quarta, G. ∙ D’Elia, M. Just at That Time: 14C Determinations and Analyses from EB IVA Layers Matthiae, P. ∙ Marchetti, N. (Editors) Ebla and Its Landscape. Early State Formation in the Ancient Near East Left Coast Press, 2013 Google Scholar ).
After this dramatic event, during Early Bronze IVB (ca. 2300-2000 BCE) Ebla lived a stage of initial crisis and following reorganization during the initial and central stages of the period, respectively, followed by a phase of new growth, represented by the reappearance of public, monumental architecture at the site, during the late phase of the period, during the 21th century BCE ( D’Andrea, 2014–2015; Matthiae, 2006, 2007, 2009b 45.

At this time, Ebla had commercial relations with the Ur III Dynasty in southern Mesopotamia. Another destruction put an end to this phase of the settlement ( Matthiae, 2009a, 2020 128. Matthiae, P.

It seems more and more possible that some of the cultural developments of the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1600 BCE) started earlier, during Early Bronze IVB and elements of continuity between Early Bronze IV and the Middle Bronze Age have been noticed in material culture, architecture, iconography, and royal ideology ( D’Andrea, 2019; Matthiae, 2002, 2013a; Pinnock, 2009 44.

Proceedings of a Conference Held at the British Museum on 20–21 April 2004 The Palestine Exploration Fund, 2009 Google Scholar ). However, the reconstruction of the Middle Bronze Age city was marked by substantial changes in the urban layout. The new 2 nd millennium BCE city comprised the massive earthen rampart fortifications with four city-gates and several forts and fortresses; a Royal Citadel with a royal palace and dynastic temple on the Acropolis ( Matthiae, 2011 131. Matthiae, P. Fouilles à Tell Mardikh-Ébla en 2009-2010: les débuts de l’exploration de la citadelle paléosyrienne Comptes rendus des séances de l’Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. 2011; 155 :735-773 Google Scholar ), encircled by an inner fortification; and a belt of temples, sanctuaries, and palaces around the Acropolis uncovered on the north, west and south sides.
Epigraphic data allowed determining that the new Middle Bronze Age city was the seat of Amorite leaders since the beginning. From circa 1800 BCE, Ebla was subjugated by the kingdom of Yamhad, centered on Aleppo, but remained a major regional center, with a flourishing and sophisticated urban culture, as testified, for example, by the jewelry and metalwork found in the Royal Hypogea or the bone and ivory Egyptianizing inlays discovered in the Northern Palace ( Scandone Matthiae, 2002 184. Scandone Matthiae, G. Materiali e Studi Archeologici di Ebla 3. Gli avori egittizzanti del Palazzo Settentrionale Sapienza University of Rome, 2002 Google Scholar ), as well as with far-reaching interregional relations. A third, final, destruction brought also the Middle Bronze Age settlement of Ebla to an end; from a bi-lingual Hittite-Hurrian text called Song of Release, it seems that the site was destroyed by a coalition of Hittites and Hurrians led by an otherwise unknown personage called Pizikarra of Nineveh ( Matthiae, 2009a 128. Matthiae, P. Crisis and Collapse: Similarity and Diversity in the Three Destructions of Ebla from EB IVA to MB II Scienze dell’Antichità. 2009; 15 :165-204 Google Scholar ).
After this major destruction, the site never recovered as a regional center, although it was continuously occupied during the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600-1200 BCE), as demonstrated by the archaeological investigations on the Acropolis ( Matthiae, 2011 131. Matthiae, P. Fouilles à Tell Mardikh-Ébla en 2009-2010: les débuts de l’exploration de la citadelle paléosyrienne Comptes rendus des séances de l’Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. 2011; 155 :735-773 Google Scholar ). The site was occupied by a rural village during Iron Age I-III (ca. 1200-535 BCE), and was the seat of a palace during the Persian/Hellenistic Period (ca. 535-55 BCE). Subsequently, it was occupied by a monastic community during the Roman/Byzantine Period (ca. 55 BCE- AD 600), and, after this, it was never permanently settled again; at the time of the First Crusade, at the end of the 11 th century AD, the troops of Godfrey of Bouillon shortly stopped at the site on their way to Jerusalem ( Matthiae, 2010 130. Matthiae, P. Ebla la città del trono. Archeologia e storia, Torino, Piccola Biblioteca Einaudi, 2010 492 Google Scholar ).
A total of eleven individuals from Ebla produced genome-wide data and were including in genetic analyses. • ▪ ETM001 (individual from TM.82/79.G.400, Dep K (A+B) or Tomb D1) ( Baffi Guardata, 1988 20. Baffi Guardata, F. Les Sépoltures d’Ebla à l’age du Bronze Moyen Waetzoldt, H. ∙ Hauptmann, H. (Editors) Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft von Ebla. Akten der Internationalen Tagung Heidelberg 4.-7. November 1986 Akten der internationalen Tagung, 1988 Google Scholar ) is a 5 to 7-year-old child represented by a fragmentary skull and a few fragmentary skeletal remains in a multiple pit burial. The pit was cut through the layers associated with the EB IVA Palace G and is dated to the Middle Bronze I (ca. 2000-1800 BCE). Funerary goods included 19 pottery vessels, a bronze bracelet, and animal bones ( Baffi Guardata, 1988 20. Baffi Guardata, F. Les Sépoltures d’Ebla à l’age du Bronze Moyen Waetzoldt, H. ∙ Hauptmann, H. (Editors) Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft von Ebla. Akten der Internationalen Tagung Heidelberg 4.-7. November 1986 Akten der internationalen Tagung, 1988 Google Scholar ). • ▪ ETM004 (TM.98.V.538, D.7417, Skull A) is a child aged between 6 and 12 years whose remains were identified by a skull in a pit burial with multiple mixed disarticulated inhumations (e.g., ETM005 and ETM006). The burial is dated to the Middle Bronze Age I (ca. 2000-1800 BCE). Funerary goods were represented by 16 pottery vessels, either complete or almost complete. • ▪ ETM005 (TM.98.V.538, D.7417, Skull B; same burial as ETM004) is an adult aged between 30 and 40 years identified by the skull. Dental pathologies were observed. • ▪ ETM006 (TM.98.V.538, D.7417, Skull C; same burial as ETM004) is an adult aged between 30 and 40 years identified by the skull. Dental pathologies were observed. • ▪ ETM010 (TM.98.CC.113, D.7278) is a macroscopically possible male individual, aged between 30 and 40 years in a pit grave from the Early Bronze III Period (ca. 2700-2500 BCE). The skeletal remains were fragmentary and disarticulated. Dental pathologies and osteological conditions at the lower limbs were observed. • ▪ ETM012 (TM.91.P.853/2) is an infant aged 6-12 months, possibly buried in a jar. The skeletal remains were found in room L.5021 of Building P4 (for the archaeological context and pottery assemblage of the building) (see Matthiae, 1993a, 2013; Marchetti and Nigro, 1995–1996 113.

In spite the fragmented condition of the burial, almost the complete skeleton of the infant was recovered. No evidence of pathologies was present and no associated funerary goods were found. Dating of human bone: 2572-2470 cal BCE (3997 ± 25 BP, MAMS-41114) • ▪ ETM014 (TM.95.V.491, D.6371) is an individual aged between 30 and 35 years in a poorly preserved pit burial ( Baffi Guardata, 2000 21. Baffi Guardata, F. Les Tombes du Bronze Moyen dans le Secteur des Fortifications à Ebla Matthiae, P. ∙ Enea, A. ∙ Peyronel, L. ... (Editors) Proceedings of the 1st International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, Rome, May 18th-23rd 1998 Sapienza University of Rome, 2000 Google Scholar ). The skeletal remains were also very fragmentary. Caries were observed on one of the preserved teeth. The tomb was identified in the area of the Middle Bronze Age I (ca. 2000-1800 BCE) rampart; funerary goods were represented by a single combed jar ( Baffi Guardata, 2000 21. Baffi Guardata, F. Les Tombes du Bronze Moyen dans le Secteur des Fortifications à Ebla Matthiae, P. ∙ Enea, A. ∙ Peyronel, L. ... (Editors) Proceedings of the 1st International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, Rome, May 18th-23rd 1998 Sapienza University of Rome, 2000 Google Scholar ). • ▪ ETM016 (TM.95.V.497, D.6384) is a male individual aged 20-30 years, buried in a crouched position in a pit that dates to the Late or terminal Middle Bronze IB (ca. 1850 BCE). The pit burial was possibly originally lined with mud bricks. The complete skeleton was preserved ( Baffi Guardata, 2000 21. Baffi Guardata, F. Les Tombes du Bronze Moyen dans le Secteur des Fortifications à Ebla Matthiae, P. ∙ Enea, A. ∙ Peyronel, L. ... (Editors) Proceedings of the 1st International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, Rome, May 18th-23rd 1998 Sapienza University of Rome, 2000 Google Scholar ) and did not display any evidence of pathologies. Funerary goods included five pottery vessels: a miniature cup in Cooking Ware fabric, a cooking pot, a combed jar, a miniature trefoil-mouthed juglet, and a carinated bowl ( Baffi Guardata, 2000 21. Baffi Guardata, F. Les Tombes du Bronze Moyen dans le Secteur des Fortifications à Ebla Matthiae, P. ∙ Enea, A. ∙ Peyronel, L. ... (Editors) Proceedings of the 1st International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, Rome, May 18th-23rd 1998 Sapienza University of Rome, 2000 Google Scholar ). Dating of human bone: 2026-1896 cal BCE (3605 ± 25 BP, MAMS-41116) • ▪ ETM018 (TM.98.AA.310, D.7363) is a macroscopically possible male individual, older than 45 years who was identified by an incomplete skull. He was buried with at least two more individuals in a pit burial that was covered by mud bricks and was dated to the Middle Bronze I (ca. 2000-1800 BCE). His dental condition is consistent with the age at death. Funerary goods included a fragmentary clay figurine, a shell, and eight pottery vessels: a jar, two collared jars/bowls, a piriform jar, an ovoid jar, and three carinated bowls. Presence of animal bones was associated with the burial. Dating of human tooth: (2135-1964 cal BCE, 3667 ± 26 BP, MAMS-41635) • ▪ ETM023 (TM.82.G.438, D. μ TM.83.G.438) is an individual aged 15-18 years that was found in pit seemingly intruding into the Early Bronze IVA layers of Palace G. The skeletal remains of this individual were incomplete and exhibited visible signs of burning. The skull was recovered complete. The chronology is not determined, although the anthropological report refers to an EB IVA date for the bones (ca. 2350/2300 BCE). • ▪ ETM026 (TM.83.G, D.3620 or D.22 in Baffi Guardata [2000 21. Baffi Guardata, F. Les Tombes du Bronze Moyen dans le Secteur des Fortifications à Ebla Matthiae, P. ∙ Enea, A. ∙ Peyronel, L. ... (Editors) Proceedings of the 1st International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, Rome, May 18th-23rd 1998 Sapienza University of Rome, 2000 Google Scholar ]) is a male individual aged 25-30 years, in a primary crouched burial. The pit burial is dated to the Middle Bronze I (2000-1800 BCE), possibly to its earliest phase ( Nigro, 2002 147. Nigro, L. The Middle Bronze Age Horizon of Northern Inner Syria on the Basis of the Stratified Assemblages of Tell Mardikh and Hama Al-Maqdissi, M. ∙ Matoïan, V. ∙ Nicolle, C. (Editors) Céramique de l’âge du Bronze en Syrie I. La Syrie du Sud et la Vallée de l’Oronte Bibliothèque Archéologique et Historique, 2002 Google Scholar ). The skeletal remains were well preserved, though incomplete and fragmentary. The dentition displayed evidence of tartar and enamel hypoplasia. Funerary goods include a jar with double-everted rim and a cooking pot ( Baffi Guardata, 1988 20. Baffi Guardata, F. Les Sépoltures d’Ebla à l’age du Bronze Moyen Waetzoldt, H. ∙ Hauptmann, H. (Editors) Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft von Ebla. Akten der Internationalen Tagung Heidelberg 4.-7. November 1986 Akten der internationalen Tagung, 1988 Google Scholar ) and the skull of an ovine was associated with the human bones ( Baffi Guardata, 1988 20. Baffi Guardata, F.

Excavation: University of Chicago, Oriental Institute, 1995-2001, directed by Kutlu Aslıhan Yener. The site of Tell Kurdu is located in the Amuq Plain in the Turkish province of Hatay in southern Turkey ( Özbal et al., 2004 152. Özbal, R. ∙ Gerritsen, F. ∙ Diebold, B. ... Tell Kurdu Excavations 2001 Anatolica. 2004; 30 :37-107 Crossref Google Scholar ). The roughly triangularly shaped Amuq Plain measures about 35 × 40 km and is covered with fertile agricultural soils. The plain is surrounded on all sides by upland ranges including the Amanus Mountains, Kurt Dağ, Jebel Zahwiye and Jebel al-Aqra and is fed by three rivers: the Kara Su, the Afrin and the Orontes. The mound of Tell Kurdu, located centrally in the plain, was occupied in the 6 th and the 5 th millennia BCE and is the largest prehistoric site known in the valley. The 6 th millennium levels at the site correspond to the Amuq C Phase contemporaneous with the North Mesopotamian Halaf Period, while the 5 th millennium levels correspond to the Amuq E Phase, which based on the Northern Mesopotamian chronological periods equates with the Ubaid Period. All of the six burials from Tell Kurdu analyzed for this project come from the 2001 excavations which were concentrated on the north of the mound ( Özbal, 2006 153. Özbal, R.F. Households, Daily Practice and Cultural Appropriation at Sixth Millennium Tell Kurdu. PhD Thesis Northwestern University, 2006 Google Scholar ). Excavations here yielded a neighborhood of densely packed small structures separated by streets and alleys that date to the Amuq C Phase of the 6 th millennium BCE. Based on stratigraphy, one of the burials analyzed (KRD001) was securely dated within the architectural phase while most of the other burials in this study including KRD003, KRD004, KRD005, KRD006 were stratigraphically unclear and were assumed to date to just after the architecture had been abandoned. However, the radiocarbon dates suggest that they fall squarely within the main architectural phase or were buried very briefly following abandonment. Even though it essentially came from the same area, KRD002 dates to about a millennium later when this part of the mound functioned as a cemetery during the Amuq E Phase. The main occupation in this phase was concentrated on the southern parts of the mound. The age descriptions and sex designations for the burials described below come from an unpublished study by Lorentz and supersede those published in ( Özbal et al., 2004 152. Özbal, R. ∙ Gerritsen, F. ∙ Diebold, B. ... Tell Kurdu Excavations 2001 Anatolica. 2004; 30 :37-107 Crossref Google Scholar ).
A total of six individuals from Tell Kurdu produced genome-wide data and are included in the genetic analyses. • ▪ KRD001 (TK_12:81) is an adolescent aged 10-12 years. The burial was securely dated to the Amuq C Phase related to the main architectural phase. No burial gifts were found associated with the skeleton which was discovered in a tightly flexed position. The inhumation was found cut into the lowest excavated floor of Room R06 and sealed by an overlying floor. Dating of human bone: 5710-5662 cal BCE (6783 ± 23 BP, MAMS-40663). • ▪ KRD002 (TK_24:3) is a relatively well-preserved mature adult. The burial included one small Amuq E Phase painted cup which was placed not far from the individual’s head. Unlike other burials which are typically found in simple pits, this one was placed in a rectangular mudbrick box of which the bottom row of bricks was preserved. Dating of human bone: 4991-4911 cal BCE (6044 ± 22 BP, MAMS-40664). • ▪ KRD003 (TK_22:2) is a mature adult placed in a simple pit in a tightly flexed position. The burial included a small painted necked-jar placed near the head as well as a Dark Faced Burnished globular jar discovered by the feet. Dating of human bone: 5661-5630 cal BCE (6739 ± 23 BP, MAMS-40665). • ▪ KRD004 (TK_25:80) is an adult male placed in a pit in a tightly flexed position. A small Dark Faced Burnished necked-jar was discovered by the head. A partial cattle mandible had been left just over the neck of the jar. Dating of human bone: 5703-5639 cal BCE (6766 ± 25 BP, MAMS-40666). • ▪ KRD005 (TK_25:89) is an infant buried in a flexed position. A small unpainted vessel was directly by the infant’s head. The burial’s stratigraphic relationship to the architecture is not clear but it was placed in room R45 either when the room was in use or shortly after abandonment. Dating of human bone 5739-5676 cal BCE (6738 ± 24 BP, MAMS-40667). • ▪ KRD006 (TK_26:12) is an infant placed in a large bowl. Near the infant and possibly associated with the burial, excavations yielded a small painted miniature vessel, which based on decoration and style must be considered Amuq C in date. Given the location of the burial inside room R54 and the motifs on the nearby vessel, we expect this burial to be contemporaneous with the others analyzed here (with the exception of KRD002) and that it dates to approximately 5700 cal BCE.

Excavation: University of California San Diego 1991-1999, directed by Guillermo Algaze
Titriş Höyük, situated in the lower Euphrates basin, is located 45 km north of Şanlıurfa, Turkey ( Matney and Algaze, 1995 119. Matney, T. ∙ Algaze, G. Urban Development at Mid-Late Early Bronze Age Titriş Höyük in Southeastern Anatolia Bull. Am. Schools Orient. Res. 1995; 299–300 :33-52 Crossref Google Scholar ). On the basis of C14 dating, three culture levels were identified at the site; Early EBA (ca. 2900–2600 BCE), Mid EBA (ca 2600/2500–2400/2300 BCE) and Late EBA (ca. 2300–2200/2100 BCE) ( Algaze et al., 1995, 1996, 2001; Matney et al., 1997, 1999 13.

Matney, T. ∙ Algaze, G. ∙ Rosen, S. Early Bronze Age urban structure at Titriş Höyük, southeastern Turkey: the 1998 season Anatolica. 1999; 25 :185-201 Crossref Google Scholar ). Spread over a 43-hectare area, Titriş Höyük has an acropolis in the center, the Lower Town surrounding the acropolis, and the Outer Town which consists of sparsely scattered suburban areas ( Matney and Algaze, 1995 119. Matney, T. ∙ Algaze, G. Urban Development at Mid-Late Early Bronze Age Titriş Höyük in Southeastern Anatolia Bull. Am. Schools Orient. Res. 1995; 299–300 :33-52 Crossref Google Scholar ).
The settlement expanded from the acropolis to the Lower Town during the Early EBA. In the Mid EBA, the Lower Town developed further and spread toward the Outer Town. There is an extramural cemetery dating to this period 400 m. west of the settlement. The settlement had undergone significant changes with the Late EBA; the houses in Outer Town were abandoned and the city was surrounded by a large fortification wall. Titriş Höyük people who started to live behind this wall in the Late EBA stopped using the extramural cemetery and began to bury their dead in housing areas, beneath the floors of rooms or courtyards ( Laneri, 2007 95. Laneri, N. Burial practices at Titriş Höyük, Turkey: an interpretation J. Near East. Stud. 2007; 66 :241-266 Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar ).
Since the excavations in the Early EBA level were limited to a small area, only one cist grave could be unearthed. On the other hand, there are 50 and 67 graves dating to Mid and Late EBA respectively. These graves consist of simple pits, stone cists and pithoi. Multiple burials were found in both Mid and Late EBA graves. While some individuals were articulated, some others completely lost their articulation. The skeletal remains which have no articulation, are represented only by skull and a few postcranial bones. It is stated that all the bones except skulls were removed to make room for the last deceased ( Laneri, 2007; Matney et al., 2012 95. Laneri, N. Burial practices at Titriş Höyük, Turkey: an interpretation J. Near East. Stud. 2007; 66 :241-266 Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar 122. Matney, T. ∙ Algaze, G. ∙ Dulik, M.C. ... Understanding Early Bronze Age Social Structure Through Mortuary Remains: A Pilot aDNA Study From Titriş Höyük, Southeastern Turkey Int. J. Osteoarchaeol. 2012; 22 :338-351 Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar ). For this reason, the preservation condition of Titriş Höyük skeletal remains is not good and the individuals are represented only by fragments. Pots in various forms, bronze pins, bronze/silver earrings and rings, necklaces of stone beads are among the grave goods of both Mid and Late EBA graves. However, unlike Mid EBA graves, daggers and spearheads were found in Late EBA graves ( Laneri, 2007 95. Laneri, N. Burial practices at Titriş Höyük, Turkey: an interpretation J. Near East. Stud. 2007; 66 :241-266 Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar ).
The most remarkable burial among Titriş Höyük graves is the burial made on a plaster basin. Chemical analyses carried out with the samples taken from these plastered platforms found in most of the Late EBA houses demonstrate that these platforms might have been used in wine processing. The circular and slightly concave plastered platform, 140 cm in diameter, consist of a floor where small and medium-sized limestone is combined with muddy plaster at the bottom, pebbles in the middle and a thick limestone powder which was also used for the floor of the houses at the top ( Laneri, 2002; Matney and Algaze, 1995 94. Laneri, N. The Discovery of a Funerary Ritual: Inanna/Ishtar and Her Descent to the Nether World in Titriş Höyük, Turkey East and West. 2002; 52 :9-51 Google Scholar 119. Matney, T. ∙ Algaze, G. Urban Development at Mid-Late Early Bronze Age Titriş Höyük in Southeastern Anatolia Bull. Am. Schools Orient. Res. 1995; 299–300 :33-52 Crossref Google Scholar ). Skeletal remains belonging to minimum 19 individuals were found on one of these platforms during the 1998 excavation season (three subadults, three adult females, 13 adult males). At this unique burial, while postcranial bones were piled up at the center of the plaster basin, the crania were placed on the top of the postcranial bones at the edges without a unity of direction. 13 of the 16 adult individuals have perimortem traumas caused by an axe, dagger and spearhead on their skulls. Based on the presence of skeletal remains of each age and sex groups in this grave and the high frequency of perimortem traumata on the skulls, it was concluded that these individuals were victims of a possible massacre ( Erdal, 2012a 51. Erdal, Ö.D. A Possible Massacre at Early Bronze Age Titriş Höyük, Anatolia Int. J. Osteoarchaeol. 2012; 22 :1-21 Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar ).
One individual from Titriş Höyük produced genome-wide data and is included in genetic analyses. • ▪ TIT021 (TH80084) is one of the 16 skulls on the plaster basin. Since it is a secondary burial, its relationship with scattered postcranial bones could not be established. Considering the morphological structure of the skull, the individual was estimated to be male. According to the ectocranial suture closure, it is estimated that the individual is a middle adult aged 35-40 years. There are two healed depressed traumas on the skull. In addition, two perimortem traumas were identified, one caused by a penetrating or a sharp object and the other by a sharp object. Due to the lack of healing marks around these penetrating and sharp force traumas on the left side of the skull, it was determined that the individual died as a result of these traumas. Dating of human tooth: 2331-2143 cal BCE (3799 ± 25 BP, MAMS-40684)
E = Early, M = Middle, L = Late, EP = Epipaleolithic, N = Neolithic, C = Chalcolithic, BA = Bronze Age, Eneolithic = En.
For the purpose of this study, we mainly used as group designation the name of the archaeological site and the archaeological period ( Eisenmann et al., 2018 50. Eisenmann, S. ∙ Bánffy, E. ∙ van Dommelen, P. ... Reconciling material cultures in archaeology with genetic data: The nomenclature of clusters emerging from archaeogenomic analysis Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 13003–3 Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar ). We caution here that period-based cultural divisions such as “Chalcolithic” and “Neolithic” vary from region to region and must be considered artificial boundaries instead of absolute chronological markers. For example, 6 th millennium BCE is considered Early Chalcolithic in Anatolia and Late Neolithic in Southern Caucasus. Tell Kurdu, albeit located in Northern Levant, is a site that displays a mixture of both Anatolian and North Mesopotamian elements with regards to its architecture and material culture. Therefore, its 6 th millennium BCE levels are more usually referred to as Early Chalcolithic based on the Anatolian chronological designations.
Sites for which samples covered more than one archaeological period were Arslantepe and Tell Kurdu. Given the temporal distribution of the samples at Arslantepe ( Figure 2 B), we grouped together all individuals from the Late Chalcolithic and the very beginning of Early Bronze Age as “Arslantepe_LC” and those from Early Bronze age as “Arslantepe_EBA.”
Genetic information (PCA-based) was also taken into consideration for outlying individuals (i.e., Alalakh_MLBA_outlier). Also, in order to maintain information about intragroup variability, we measured with f 4 -statistics whether any individuals systematically shared more alleles with other populations compared to other individuals from the group.
Exception to the archaeological site-period nomenclature were the two Neolithic sites in the Southern Caucasian lowlands (Mentesh Tepe and Polutepe), each represented by only one individual (MTT001 and POT002 respectively). We grouped these two individuals as Caucasus_lowlands_LN (in agreement with f4 -statistics suggesting no breaks in their cladality). For consistency, we refer to the Chalcolithic site of Alkhantepe (ALX002) as Caucasus_lowlands_LC. Accordingly, published individuals/groups from Anatolia were renamed applying the same scheme, i.e., name of archaeological site “underscore” archaeological period.
For other ancient groups relevant to our study we applied a nomenclature system of area and archaeological time period (ex Levant_EBA) provided that this does not contradict genetic evidence. Especially, for the area of Caucasus where genetic characterization has been carried on a big number of ancient individuals ( Allentoft et al., 2015; Lazaridis et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019 18. Allentoft, M.E. ∙ Sikora, M. ∙ Sjögren, K.G. ... Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia Nature. 2015; 522 :167-172 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar 98. Lazaridis, I. ∙ Nadel, D. ∙ Rollefson, G. ... Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East Nature. 2016; 536 :419-424 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 212. Wang, C.C. ∙ Reinhold, S. ∙ Kalmykov, A. ... Ancient human genome-wide data from a 3000-year interval in the Caucasus corresponds with eco-geographic regions Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :590 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), we used a combined nomenclature of ecogeographical area, archaeological time and genetic clustering. All new group labels are given in Table S3 .
All individuals with newly-reported genetic data and without direct dating previously performed on them were dated at the radiocarbon dating facility of the Klaus-Tschira-Archäometrie-Zentrum at the CEZ Archaeometry gGmbH, Mannheim, Germany using a MICADAS-AMS and ∼1gr of bone material. With a few exceptions, we dated a sample from the same skeletal element that was sampled for the DNA extraction. Collagen was extracted from the bone samples, purified by ultrafiltration (fraction > 30kD) and freeze-dried. Collagen was combusted to CO 2 in an Elemental Analyzer (EA) and CO 2 was converted catalytically to graphite. 14 C ages were normalized to δ 13 C = −25‰ and were given in BP (before present) meaning years before 1950. The calibration was done using the dataset INTCAL13 ( Reimer et al., 2013 176. Reimer, P.J. ∙ Bard, E. ∙ Bayliss, A. ... IntCal13 and Marine13 Radiocarbon Age Calibration Curves 0–50,000 Years cal BP Radiocarbon. 2013; 55 :1869-1887 Crossref Scopus (7731) Google Scholar ) and the software SwissCal 1.0 (L. Wacker, ETH-Zürich).
We extracted DNA and prepared next generation sequencing libraries from 174 samples in a dedicated aDNA facility in Jena following established protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation.
Prior to sampling of petrous bones, we carefully wiped the bone surface with 10% bleach and water and then UV-irradiated the surface for 30 min. Sampling targeted the inner-ear portion of the petrous bone ( Pinhasi et al., 2015 168. Pinhasi, R. ∙ Fernandes, D. ∙ Sirak, K. ... Optimal Ancient DNA Yields from the Inner Ear Part of the Human Petrous Bone PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0129102 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the method varied based on the preservation conditions of the sample and/or the destructive constraints as follows: a. Well preserved samples without constraints in destructive sampling: a bone wedge was cut out around the region of the cochlea using an electric saw (K-POWERgrip EWL 4941), removed the surface and ground it to fine bone powder. b. Poorly preserved samples: cutting in the middle with a jeweler’s saw and drilling bone powder (K-POWERgrip EWL 4941) from one side directly at the osseous labyrinth. c. Minimally invasive method: removal of surface layer and drilling from outside targeting the area of the inner ear.
After UV-irradiation step (30 min) teeth were cut at the cemento-enamel junction and then sampled by drilling from the inner pulp chamber of the crown. Whenever this sampling method could not yield a minimum of 50 mg of bone powder, we complemented with bone powder drilled from the pulp of the root.
We used 50-100 mg of bone powder for the DNA extraction. First, we incubated the bone powder in a lysis buffer containing 0.45 M EDTA, pH 8.0 and 0.25 mg/ml Proteinase K with overnight rotation at 37°C. After centrifugation, we transferred the supernatant to a new 15ml tube containing 10.4 mL of binding buffer of 5 M Guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), 40% Isopropanol (Merck) and 400 μL of 3 M Sodium Acetate pH 5.2 (Sigma-Aldrich). We spun the mix through a silica column (High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit; Roche) at 1,500 rpm for 8 min. We dry-spun the column with centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min and washed the DNA bound to the column twice with 450 μL of wash buffer (High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit; Roche) and spinning at 8,000 r cf. for 1 min. After two dry-spin steps of 30 s, we incubated the columns for 3 min with 50 μL Tris-EDTA elution buffer (High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit; Roche) containing 0.05% of Tween 20% (Sigma- Aldrich) and spun for 2 min at 14,000 rpm. We repeated this elution step, and collected the 100 μL of eluted DNA in a LoBind collection tube (Eppendorf). All DNA extracts were stored at −20°C. At every extraction experiment we included one blank control (extraction buffer) and bone powder of cave bear as a positive control.
We prepared double-stranded libraries from 25 μL of DNA extract using the partial Uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG) protocol, which removes most of the deaminated cytosines – aDNA damage occurring post-mortem – but maintains some molecules with terminal damage ( Rohland et al., 2015 180. Rohland, N. ∙ Harney, E. ∙ Mallick, S. ... Partial uracil-DNA-glycosylase treatment for screening of ancient DNA Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2015; 370 :20130624 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed the partial UDG-treatment by adding 25 μL of mastermix consisting of 0.07 USER enzyme, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 1.2 mM ATP (all NEB), 0.1 mM dNTP mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1.2X Buffer Tango (Life Technologies), and finally incubating for 30 min at 37°C and 1 min at 12°C. We then added 0.13 U UGI (Uracil Glycosylase inhibitor) and repeated the incubation step. For the blunt-end repair of the double-stranded molecules we added 0.5 U T4 Polynucleotide Kinase, 0.08 U T4 DNA Polymerase (both NEB), and incubated for 20 min at 25°C for 20 min and then 10 min at 10°C. We purified the product with a standard MinElute PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN) eluting in 18 μL of EB containing 0.05% of Tween (EBT). The ligation of Illumina adaptors was carried out with 1X Quick Ligase Buffer (NEB) and (0.25 μM adaptor mix) in a total reaction volume of 40 μL and 1 μL of 0.125 U Quick Ligase followed by an incubation at 22°C for 10 min and another MinElute purification step. The fill-in of the ligated adaptors included 1X isothermal buffer, 0.4 U/μl Bst-polymerase (NEB), 0.125 mM dNTP mix and an incubation at 37°C for 30 min followed by 10 min at 80°C. A negative library control (H 2 O) was taken along at every experiment.
We evaluated the success of library preparation by quantifying the number of unique molecules in an aliquot from each library with qPCR performed on a LightCycler 96 (Roche) installed outside the clean room and using IS7/IS8 primers and the DyNAmo SYBP Green qPCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We assigned unique combinations of two 8bp-long indices at every library and attached them with an amplification reaction using Pfu-Turbo Cx Hotstart DNA Polymerase (Agilent Technologies) and 10 cycles of 30 s at 58°C and 1 min at 72°C followed by an elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. We purified the amplified product with a MinElute kit (QIAGEN) and then eluted in 50 μL EBT. We re-quantified an aliquot from every indexed library with qPCR using IS5/IS6 primers and we reamplified to 10 13 copies with Herculase II Fusion Polymerase following the manufacturer’s protocol. After another purification step with final elution at 50 μL of EBT, we measured an aliquot at an Agilent 4200 TapeStation in order to check fragment length and concentration.
We pooled libraries equimolarly to 10nm and submit them for sequencing in one of the in-house sequencing platforms HiSeq 4000 or NextSeq500 using a paired-end (PE 2x50) or a single-read (SR 75) kit. After initial shotgun sequencing of 5-10 million reads (or 10-20 for PE sequencing) and demultiplexing, all libraries were processed through EAGER ( Peltzer et al., 2016 164. Peltzer, A. ∙ Jäger, G. ∙ Herbig, A. ... EAGER: efficient ancient genome reconstruction Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :60 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), a modular pipeline that streamlines the raw sequence data from FastQC and quality filtering to mapping and duplicate removal and outputs important quality information such as complexity of libraries, percentage of endogenous DNA damage, and fragment length. Sequencing adapters were clipped with AdapterRemoval ( v2.2.0 ) ( Schubert et al., 2016 192. Schubert, M. ∙ Lindgreen, S. ∙ Orlando, L. AdapterRemoval v2: rapid adapter trimming, identification, and read merging BMC Res. Notes. 2016; 9 :88 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ) and merged (paired-end sequencing) while all fragments shorter than 30 bp were discarded. Mapping was performed with BWA ( v0.7.12) ( Li and Durbin, 2009 100. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (18571) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a quality filter of q30 against the hs37d5 sequence reference. For the removal of PCR duplicates we used dedup ( v0.12.2 ) ( Peltzer et al., 2016 164. Peltzer, A. ∙ Jäger, G. ∙ Herbig, A. ... EAGER: efficient ancient genome reconstruction Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :60 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which considers both beginning and end of the merged reads with the same orientation. C to T and G to A mis-incorporations were evaluated with the tool mapdamage ( v2.0.6 ) ( Jónsson et al., 2013 84. Jónsson, H. ∙ Ginolhac, A. ∙ Schubert, M. ... mapDamage2.0: fast approximate Bayesian estimates of ancient DNA damage parameters Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :1682-1684 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). Libraries that passed the thresholds of quality control (> 0.1% of endogenous DNA, > ∼5% C to T mis-incorporation at terminal 5′ base) were subjected to an in-solution hybridization enrichment that targets at 1,233,3013 genome-wide and ancestry-informative SNPs (“1240K SNP capture”) ( Mathieson et al., 2015 117. Mathieson, I. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Rohland, N. ... Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians Nature. 2015; 528 :499-503 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). Libraries were not pooled prior to this enrichment experiment. Whenever the mitochondrial reads from either the shotgun sequencing or the 1240K capture were not sufficient for the reconstruction of the whole mitochondrial genome, the call of mitochondrial haplotypes and the estimation of mitochondrial contamination, we carried out another in-solution enrichment which targets at the whole mitochondrial DNA (“mito capture”) ( Fu et al., 2015 62. Fu, Q. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ∙ Moldovan, O.T. ... An early modern human from Romania with a recent Neanderthal ancestor Nature. 2015; 524 :216-219 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). Captured libraries were sequenced at the order of 20 million reads (or 40 million for PE) and were streamlined through EAGER with the same parameters as for shotgun sequencing data. We ran preseq ( v2.0 ) ( Daley and Smith, 2013 46. Daley, T. ∙ Smith, A.D. Predicting the molecular complexity of sequencing libraries Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :325-327 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) on 1240K data, a tool that uses a histogram of targeted sites and the number of unique and duplicated reads in order to compute an extrapolation of the library complexity for bigger sequencing experiments. Subsequently, we deeper-sequenced the captured libraries to maximize the use of each library’s complexity. We merged bam files across libraries from the same individual and re-run dedup. We generated masked versions of the bam files in which we masked the ends of the reads until the nucleotide with misincorporation frequency ≤ 1% using trimBam ( https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BamUtil:_trimBam ). To minimize the reference bias in low-coverage data, after generating the pileup (with -q30 and -Q30 filters), we extracted haploid genotypes with the tool pileupCaller ( https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools/tree/master/src/SequenceTools ), which randomly chooses a single read at every SNP position and generates pseudo-diploid genotypes. We performed the random calling both on the original and the masked bam files of each library. For the final genotypes we kept the transitions from the masked and the transversions from the original bam files.
We only included individuals with ≥ 40,000 SNPs of the potential 1240K SNPs covered for downstream population genetics analysis. We estimated contamination on these individuals based on the mitochondrial heterozygosity ( Renaud et al., 2015 177. Renaud, G. ∙ Slon, V. ∙ Duggan, A.T. ... Schmutzi: estimation of contamination and endogenous mitochondrial consensus calling for ancient DNA Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :224 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) and on the heterozygosity at the polymorphic sites on the X chromosome on the males with ANGSD ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 92. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Samples from same individual or samples from genetically related individuals are relatively common cases when working with bone material from archaeological sites. To test for biological kinship, we estimated the pairwise mismatch rate (pmr) ( Kennett et al., 2017 87. Kennett, D.J. ∙ Plog, S. ∙ George, R.J. ... Archaeogenomic evidence reveals prehistoric matrilineal dynasty Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14115 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ) among all possible pairs of individuals from within an archaeological site by counting the number of SNPs for which the two individuals had a mismatch on genotype (0-2 or 2-0) and dividing with the total number of overlapping SNPs (SNPs without missing data in either individual).
It is known that two genomic libraries produced from the same individual or two identical twins (coefficient of relatedness r = 1) will exhibit a pmr which should be half of that of a pair of unrelated individuals ( r = 0) and the pmr will be a linear function of r ( Jeong et al., 2018 81. Jeong, C. ∙ Wilkin, S. ∙ Amgalantugs, T. ... Bronze Age population dynamics and the rise of dairy pastoralism on the eastern Eurasian steppe Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 E11248 Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar ). Assuming no inbreeding within the population, the pmr of unrelated individuals (UI) can be empirically estimated by the distribution of pmr of multiple individuals. When we detected pairs with IT pmr, we cross-checked with the archaeological context whether these can be attributed to cases of samples from the same individual and, subsequently we merged the data under the name of one individual. For pairs with IT < pmr < UI we calculated the coefficient of relatedness r as (UI-pmr)/IT. For statistically robust estimates of the coefficient we used READ ( Monroy Kuhn et al., 2018 141. Monroy Kuhn, J.M. ∙ Jakobsson, M. ∙ Günther, T. Estimating genetic kin relationships in prehistoric populations PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0195491 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) which computes pmr in non-overlapping windows of 1 Mbps and also calculates standard errors.
We used PMDtools ( Skoglund et al., 2014 198. Skoglund, P. ∙ Northoff, B.H. ∙ Shunkov, M.V. ... Separating endogenous ancient DNA from modern day contamination in a Siberian Neandertal Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :2229-2234 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), a statistical framework for the evaluation and isolation of aDNA reads based on their damage profile, on the one genetic outlier individual from Alalakh. To reduce reference bias, we provided a reference masked for 1240K SNP positions.
We merged our final dataset with publicly available datasets of ancient and modern individuals ( de Barros Damgaard et al., 2018; Feldman et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2016; Gamba et al., 2014; González-Fortes et al., 2017; Günther et al., 2015; Haber et al., 2017; Harney et al., 2018; Hofmanová et al., 2016; Jeong et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2015; Lazaridis et al., 2014, 2016, 2017; Lipson et al., 2017; Martiniano et al., 2017; Mathieson et al., 2018; McColl et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2012; Mittnik et al., 2018; Mondal et al., 2016; Olalde et al., 2015, 2018, 2019; Pickrell et al., 2012; Prüfer et al., 2017; Raghavan et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2014; Seguin-Orlando et al., 2014; Skoglund et al., 2016, 2017; Vyas et al., 2017; Narasimhan et al., 2019 48. de Barros Damgaard, P. ∙ Martiniano, R. ∙ Kamm, J. ...

We also merged with datasets of worldwide modern populations genotyped on the Human Origins array by keeping the intersection of SNPs. Both 1240K and HO datasets were restricted to the autosomal portion.
We used “samtools depth” from the samtools ( v1.3 ) ( Li et al., 2009 101. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (20875) PubMed Google Scholar ) providing the bed file with the 1240K SNPs to calculate the coverage on X, Y and autosomal chromosomes. We normalized X and Y coverage by the autosomal coverage (X-rate and Y-rate respectively). For females without contamination we expect X-rate ≈1 and Y-rate ≈0. Accordingly, for uncontaminated males we expect both X-rate and Y-rate to be ≈0.5.
In order to determine the Y haplogroups of the male individuals, we first used pileups from the bam files Rsamtools package ( Morgan et al., 2019 145. Morgan, M. ∙ Pagès, H. ∙ Obenchain, V. ... Rsamtools: Binary alignment (BAM), FASTA, variant call (BCF), and tabix file import. R package version 1.34.1 ed. http://bioconductor.org/packages/Rsamtools Date: 2019 Google Scholar ) and called the Y chromosome SNPs from reads with mapping and base qualities ≥ 30. We manually assigned Y chromosome haplogroups by manually inspecting the derived SNPs in the pileups included in the ISOGG SNP index ( v.14.07 ) (last downloaded 7 January 2019) ( Table S9 ).
The mitochondrial consensus sequences were inferred from the mito-capture data using Schmutzi ( Renaud et al., 2015 177. Renaud, G. ∙ Slon, V. ∙ Duggan, A.T. ... Schmutzi: estimation of contamination and endogenous mitochondrial consensus calling for ancient DNA Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :224 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mapping with CircularMapper ( Peltzer et al., 2016 164. Peltzer, A. ∙ Jäger, G. ∙ Herbig, A. ... EAGER: efficient ancient genome reconstruction Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :60 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) against the rCRS with mapping quality filter of q30 and consensus quality score Q30 . The mitochondrial haplotypes of the consensus sequences (≥5X coverage) were assigned by Haplogrep ( Kloss-Brandstätter et al., 2011 91. Kloss-Brandstätter, A. ∙ Pacher, D. ∙ Schönherr, S. ... HaploGrep: a fast and reliable algorithm for automatic classification of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups Hum. Mutat. 2011; 32 :25-32 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ) after visual inspection of bam pileup in Geneious ( v11.0.4 ) ( Kearse et al., 2012 86. Kearse, M. ∙ Moir, R. ∙ Wilson, A. ... Geneious Basic: an integrated and extendable desktop software platform for the organization and analysis of sequence data Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :1647-1649 Crossref Scopus (8828) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S9 ).
We performed principal component analysis on two subsets of the Human Origins Dataset: (a) 171 West Eurasian populations (2,343 individuals), and (b) 85 West Asian and East Mediterranean populations (1,221 individuals) using the smartpca program of EIGENSOFT ( v6.01 ) ( Patterson et al., 2006; Price et al., 2006 160. Patterson, N. ∙ Price, A.L. ∙ Reich, D. Population structure and eigenanalysis PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e190 Crossref Scopus (2351) PubMed Google Scholar 171. Price, A.L. ∙ Patterson, N.J. ∙ Plenge, R.M. ... Principal components analysis corrects for stratification in genome-wide association studies Nat. Genet. 2006; 38 :904-909 Crossref Scopus (5796) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters and the options lsqproject: YES, numoutlieriter: 0, to project ancient individuals onto the first two components.
We computed outgroup f 3 -statistics using the program qp3Pop from the package ADMIXTOOLS ( v5.1 ) ( Patterson et al., 2012 161. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ) and looked for evidence of maximized shared drift. We also computed f 4 -statistics using qpDstat from the same package that provide evidence of gene flow based on allele frequency sharing. We applied default parameters and the options f4mode: YES.
We used the programs qpWave and qpAdm (version 810) from ADMIXTOOLS to model the studied populations (targets) as a combination of ancestry proportions from putative selected source populations (references). This method does not require explicit knowledge about the phylogeny of the populations but harnesses the fact that if the target is related to a set of right populations (outgroups) through the references (left populations) and the references relate asymmetrically to the outgroup populations, then the target can be modeled as a combination of the references and the admixture proportions can be estimated by solving a matrix of f 4 -statistics ( Haak et al., 2015 69. Haak, W. ∙ Lazaridis, I. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe Nature. 2015; 522 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the choice of outgroups and references is of major importance. We used a set of outgroups that represents past and modern global genetic variation (Mbuti.DG, Ami.DG, Mixe.DG, Kostenki14, EHG, Villabruna, Levant_EP) and provides a good resolution for distinguishing populations from Iran, Levant Caucasus and Anatolia. Prior to the ancestry modeling we used qpWave to test whether our outgroup choice can distinguish the tested references.
We tested for signal of recent admixture events applying the recently developed method DATES ( https://github.com/priyamoorjani/DATES ) (M. Chintalapati, N. Patterson, N. Alex, and P. Moorjani, personal communication) with the following parameters: binsize = 0.001, and fit of decay curve from 0.0045 (lovalfit) to 1 (maxdist) distance bins (all in Morgan units). DATES is based on the algorithm of the roloffp program, which is specifically designed to test admixture in low-coverage ancient genome data where genotypes are typically haploid and missing rate is high ( Narasimhan et al., 2019 146. Narasimhan, V.M. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ... The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia Science. 2019; 365 :eaat7487 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each individual in the admixed target population, it first estimates the global admixture proportion by simply fitting the genotype vector of the target individual as a linear combination of the allele frequency vectors of the two source populations. Then it calculates the genotype residual by subtracting the expected genotype value, a weighted mean of source allele frequency and the corresponding global admixture proportion, from the target genotype. Finally, it multiplies the allele frequency difference between the two sources to the genotype residual to correct for the arbitrariness of the allele coding as zero or one. The weighted genotype residual performs a crude estimate of local ancestry (i.e., whether a genomic segment descends from the first or the second source), and thus the correlation between a pair of SNPs within a single individual is expected to exponentially decay as a function of the genetic distance between SNPs and the number of generations since admixture. For each genetic distance bin, DATES calculates a correlation of the weighted genotype residual across all SNP pairs within that bin and estimates admixture date in a single individual by fitting the exponential decay curve against the genetic distance. It can also easily accumulate information across target individuals without information loss, by simply using all SNP pairs from all individuals to calculate the correlation coefficient in each distance bin. Estimated times are given in generations assuming 28 years per generation ( Moorjani et al., 2016 144. Moorjani, P. ∙ Sankararaman, S. ∙ Fu, Q. ... A genetic method for dating ancient genomes provides a direct estimate of human generation interval in the last 45,000 years Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :5652-5657 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to admixture LD methods such as ALDER ( Loh et al., 2013 103. Loh, P.-R. ∙ Lipson, M. ∙ Patterson, N. ... Inferring admixture histories of human populations using linkage disequilibrium Genetics. 2013; 193 :1233-1254 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Rolloff ( Moorjani et al., 2011; Patterson et al., 2012 143. Moorjani, P. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Hirschhorn, J.N. ... The history of African gene flow into Southern Europeans, Levantines, and Jews PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 :e1001373 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar 161. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ), which require a minimum number of samples and coverage of the target population in order to estimate LD with precision, DATES can perform on a single sample from the admixed population. We further tested results where DATES detected a signal of admixture by computing two-reference weighted LD and decay fit with ALDER ( v1.03 ) and roloffp ( https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/blob/master/src/rolloffp.c ) from ADMIXTOOLS. Since ALDER allows only a small fraction of missingness for a SNP position across the individuals of the target population, grouping individuals with variable coverage decreases the resolution of the analysis. Therefore, we performed ALDER on all possible pairs of individuals within the target population, excluding individuals with less than ∼10% coverage and parameters binsize = 0.0005, mindist = 0.005 (all in Morgan units), mincount = 2, checkmap = NO and use_naive_algo = NO. For rolloffp we used parameter binsize = 0.0005, fitted the exponential curve using data between 0.005 and 0.5 distance bins (all in Morgan units). The exponential fit was performed using the nls function in R. Standard errors were calculated using a leave-one-chromosome-out approach.

Test populations consist of 300 ancient and modern worldwide populations. f 3 -statistics were estimated on autosomal portion of the Human Origins (HO) SNPs with a minimum total Nº SNP per test of 50,000. The highest 40 f 3 - statistics are presented per LC-LBA group.
