Title: TACAN Is an Ion Channel Involved in Sensing Mechanical Pain


Abstract: Summary

Mechanotransduction, the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, is a fundamental process underlying essential physiological functions such as touch and pain sensing, hearing, and proprioception. Although the mechanisms for some of these functions have been identified, the molecules essential to the sense of pain have remained elusive. Here we report identification of TACAN (Tmem120A), an ion channel involved in sensing mechanical pain. TACAN is expressed in a subset of nociceptors, and its heterologous expression increases mechanically evoked currents in cell lines. Purification and reconstitution of TACAN in synthetic lipids generates a functional ion channel. Finally, a nociceptor-specific inducible knockout of TACAN decreases the mechanosensitivity of nociceptors and reduces behavioral responses to painful mechanical stimuli but not to thermal or touch stimuli. We propose that TACAN is an ion channel that contributes to sensing mechanical pain.

Section: Introduction

The sensations of touch and pain are essential for our interactions with the environment. They rely on a cellular phenomenon called mechanotransduction, during which mechanical forces are converted into electrical signals. This vital process underlies several physiological functions, such as hearing, touch, pain, and proprioception ( Boyer et al., 2011; Chalfie, 2009; Li et al., 2012; Woo et al., 2015 6.

Many of these processes require mechanotransduction at the micro- to millisecond scale, suggesting that the transducers are mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs). The requirement for MSCs in these processes is confirmed by the recent discovery of genes responsible for the senses of touch ( Ranade et al., 2014b 47. Ranade, S.S. ∙ Woo, S.H. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ...

However, the genes responsible for the most unpleasant type of mechanotransduction, the sense of pain, remain elusive. Here we report identification of an ion channel for pain sensing. We find that TACAN contributes to mechanosensitive currents in nociceptors and mechanical pain sensing in mice.

Section: Results

A previous proteomic screen of membrane proteins involved in mechanotransduction in smooth muscle cells generated a list of over 70 candidates ( Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009 50. Sharif-Naeini, R. ∙ Folgering, J.H. ∙ Bichet, D. ... Polycystin-1 and -2 dosage regulates pressure sensing Cell. 2009; 139 :587-596 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ), including some transmembrane proteins of unknown function. One of these candidates, which we named TACAN (for “movement” in Farsi), also known as TMEM120A, NET29, or TMPIT, is highly conserved (>70% homology) in vertebrates, and conserved at lower levels in invertebrates ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Table S1 ). The predicted membrane topology (constrained consensus topology [CCTOP]) suggests that TACAN has 6 transmembrane domains with internal amino and carboxyl termini ( Figure 1 C). Tissue expression analysis revealed that TACAN is expressed in several tissues ( Figure 1 D), with higher expression in the heart, kidneys, colon, and sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Given the role of DRG neurons in the senses of touch and pain, we examined whether TACAN expression was restricted to specific subsets of mouse sensory neurons. In situ hybridization experiments ( Figure 2 A) demonstrated the presence of TACAN mRNA in DRG neurons. Analysis of the cross-sectional area distribution revealed that TACAN expression is present in small- to medium-diameter neurons ( Figure 2 B), suggesting that TACAN could be expressed in nociceptors. A similar pattern of distribution was evident when examining TACAN expression in human DRGs, with large co-expression in nociceptors ( Figure S1 ). To examine the subset of sensory neurons expressing TACAN, we generated a rabbit anti-TACAN antibody ( Figure S2 ). Our data indicate that TACAN is highly expressed in mouse non-peptidergic nociceptors, based on colabeling with markers such as P2X3, GINIP, and IB4 ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Co-labeling was low with markers of myelinated neurons (NF200), peptidergic nociceptors (CGRP), or proprioceptors (parvalbumin). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker of low-threshold C-fibers, was found in about a third of TACAN-positive sensory neurons. However, over 80% of TH-positive neurons (82.7% + 3.9%) were positive for TACAN. A previous study reported expression of this protein on the nuclear membrane of adipocytes ( Batrakou et al., 2015 4. Batrakou, D.G. ∙ de Las Heras, J.I. ∙ Czapiewski, R. ... TMEM120A and B: Nuclear Envelope Transmembrane Proteins Important for Adipocyte Differentiation PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0127712 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). We verified the plasma membrane localization of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TACAN in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and sensory neuron-derived F11 cells. Our immunofluorescence and membrane biotinylation data indicate that TACAN is present at the plasma membrane ( Figures S2 A–S2D).
One criterion for a channel’s involvement in mechanosensation is that its expression in heterologous systems should increase mechanically evoked currents ( Christensen and Corey, 2007; Vollrath et al., 2007 13. Christensen, A.P. ∙ Corey, D.P. TRP channels in mechanosensation: direct or indirect activation? Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8 :510-521 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Vollrath, M.A. ∙ Kwan, K.Y. ∙ Corey, D.P. The micromachinery of mechanotransduction in hair cells Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30 :339-365 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). In CHO cells stably transfected with TACAN, we used cell-attached recordings to determine whether it increases mechanically evoked currents ( Figure 3 A). To activate MSCs in the membrane patch under study, we applied brief pulses of negative pressure through the recording electrode. In mock-transfected CHO cells, we observed the presence of endogenous MSCs ( Figure 3 A, left panel). Stable expression of TACAN in CHO cells significantly increased mechanically evoked currents compared with mock-transfected cells ( Figures 3 A, right panel, and 3B). Although the activation threshold of the channels did not change (−33.9 ± 2.7 mm Hg, n = 31, versus −35.1 ± 3.1 mm Hg, n = 55, in mock- and TACAN-expressing cells, respectively), the percentage of active patches was significantly higher (53% versus 91% in mock- versus TACAN-expressing cells, p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test), suggesting a higher density of MSCs in TACAN-expressing cells.
In TACAN-expressing CHO cells, we determined the single-channel conductance of the MSC. Our results demonstrate that MSCs in TACAN-expressing CHO cells have a linear current-voltage (I-V) relationship with a reversal potential of 6.14 ± 2.40 mV ( Figures S3 A and S3B; n = 11). This is consistent with this MSC mediating a non-selective cationic conductance. These I-V relationships resulted in slope-conductance values of 11.5 ± 0.5 pS for TACAN-expressing cells (n = 11). Single-channel recordings with CaCl 2 as the only charge carrier demonstrated that this channel is permeable to calcium ions ( Figure S3 C). We further demonstrated through whole-cell recordings that, in the absence of mechanical stimuli, TACAN expression did not affect the voltage-gated conductances in CHO cells ( Figure S3 D).
Endogenous MSCs are tonically inhibited through their interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton, and destabilizing agents such as cytochalasin (Cyto-D) can increase mechanically evoked currents ( Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009 50. Sharif-Naeini, R. ∙ Folgering, J.H. ∙ Bichet, D. ... Polycystin-1 and -2 dosage regulates pressure sensing Cell. 2009; 139 :587-596 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined whether the enhanced mechanical responses observed in TACAN-expressing cells were due to TACAN removing the cytoskeletal inhibition of the endogenous MSC rather than TACAN being essential for the function of a mechanosensitive channel complex. If this was the case, then we would expect Cyto-D to significantly increase mechanically evoked currents in control cells but have little effect in TACAN-expressing cells. In control CHO cells, treatment with Cyto-D (1 μM) significantly increased mechanically evoked currents (compared with vehicle) to a level similar to that of vehicle-treated cells of the TACAN-expressing cell line ( Figure S3 E, left panel). However, Cyto-D treatment of TACAN-expressing cells also led to a significant increase in mechanically evoked currents, indicating that cytoskeletal inhibition of MSCs is still present in these cells and is not responsible for their increased mechanosensitivity ( Figure S3 E, right panel).
To determine whether this increase in cellular mechanosensitivity occurs in other cell types, we examined the effect of TACAN expression on mechanically evoked currents in HEK293 cells and COS-7 cells ( Figures 3 C and S3 F), which are commonly used to study MSCs ( Anderson et al., 2018; Coste et al., 2010; Li Fraine et al., 2017 1.

Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1967) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Li Fraine, S. ∙ Patel, A. ∙ Duprat, F. ... Dynamic regulation of TREK1 gating by Polycystin 2 via a Filamin A-mediated cytoskeletal Mechanism Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :17403 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). In HEK293 cells, endogenous MSCs were present in most patches (84%, 66 of 79) and activated at a threshold of −42.0 ± 2.6 mm Hg (n = 66) to reach a plateau of activation ( Figure 3 C). However, when these cells were transfected with TACAN, an additional increase in mechanically activated current became evident at thresholds negative to −80 mm Hg ( Figure 3 C), suggesting recruitment of another MSC. This increase in mechanically evoked current did not affect the activation threshold of the first MSC (−37.1 + 3.2 mm Hg, n = 47) or the percentage of active patches (82%, 47 of 57 patches). Interestingly, the activation threshold of the second mechanically evoked current is similar to that observed for MSCs in cultured primary nociceptors ( Cho et al., 2002 11. Cho, H. ∙ Shin, J. ∙ Shin, C.Y. ... Mechanosensitive ion channels in cultured sensory neurons of neonatal rats J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 :1238-1247 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), also known as high-threshold mechano-nociceptors. Furthermore, to eliminate any contribution from a previously documented MSC present in HEK293T cells, Piezo1, we used the recently described Piezo1 knockout cell line ( Dubin et al., 2017 17. Dubin, A.E. ∙ Murthy, S. ∙ Lewis, A.H. ... Endogenous Piezo1 Can Confound Mechanically Activated Channel Identification and Characterization Neuron. 2017; 94 :266-270.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; HEK293T-P1KO, termed P1KO cells for simplicity). Again, expression of TACAN in P1KO cells led to a significant increase in mechanically evoked currents ( Figure 3 D), confirming that they are independent of Piezo channels.
Interestingly, whole-cell indentation experiments did not show any TACAN-dependent, mechanically evoked current (data not shown). This is likely due to the high threshold required for TACAN activation, which is difficult to reach in flat cell lines in a culture dish without perforating the cell membrane. Such technical limitations have been reported for other MSCs ( Murthy et al., 2018a; Sianati et al., 2019 36. Murthy, S.E. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ∙ Whitwam, T. ...

Analysis of Mechanically Activated Ion Channels at the Cell-Substrate Interface: Combining Pillar Arrays and Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2019; 7 :47 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), and alternative means of channel activation have been developed ( Poole et al., 2014; Sianati et al., 2019 45. Poole, K. ∙ Herget, R. ∙ Lapatsina, L. ... Tuning Piezo ion channels to detect molecular-scale movements relevant for fine touch Nat.

Analysis of Mechanically Activated Ion Channels at the Cell-Substrate Interface: Combining Pillar Arrays and Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2019; 7 :47 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used these novel approaches to test whether TACAN can be activated by mechanical inputs applied directly at the cell-substrate interface using a pillar array analysis ( Poole et al., 2014; Sianati et al., 2019 45. Poole, K. ∙ Herget, R. ∙ Lapatsina, L. ... Tuning Piezo ion channels to detect molecular-scale movements relevant for fine touch Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3520 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Sianati, S. ∙ Kurumlian, A. ∙ Bailey, E. ... Analysis of Mechanically Activated Ion Channels at the Cell-Substrate Interface: Combining Pillar Arrays and Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2019; 7 :47 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). P1KO cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding TACAN, and multiple mechanical inputs were applied by serially deflecting a pilus subjacent to the cell. Remarkably, large (400 pA on average) mechanically evoked currents were measured in 8 of 8 cells expressing TACAN but were absent in 9 of 9 mock-transfected controls ( Figures 3 E and 3F). The kinetics of these currents (latency = 1.4 ± 0.1 ms; activation time constant = 0.7 ± 0.1 ms, mean ± SEM, n = 55 currents; Figures S3 G and S3H) are similar to those measured previously in nociceptors ( Poole et al., 2014 45. Poole, K. ∙ Herget, R. ∙ Lapatsina, L. ... Tuning Piezo ion channels to detect molecular-scale movements relevant for fine touch Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3520 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wetzel et al., 2017 56. Wetzel, C. ∙ Pifferi, S. ∙ Picci, C. ... Small-molecule inhibition of STOML3 oligomerization reverses pathological mechanical hypersensitivity Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :209-218 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ) and suggestive of a current directly activated by the mechanical stimulus. Previous analysis of mechanically evoked currents in nociceptors using pillar arrays demonstrated that rapid-adapting (RA), intermediate-adapting (IA), and slow-adapting (SA) currents could be evoked in a single cell and that mechanoreceptors had a low activation threshold (with deflections of less than 50 nm), whereas nociceptors required deflections between 200–1,000 nm ( Poole et al., 2014 45. Poole, K. ∙ Herget, R. ∙ Lapatsina, L. ... Tuning Piezo ion channels to detect molecular-scale movements relevant for fine touch Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3520 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, when expressed in P1KO cells, TACAN-dependent currents exhibited variable inactivation kinetics, with the majority classified as SA ( Figure 3 G), and the activation threshold of the currents was in the range typically observed in nociceptors ( Figures 3 E and 3F).
Our results indicate that TACAN expression increases cellular mechanosensitivity, but it remains unclear whether TACAN is an ion channel or a membrane protein that potentiates other ion channels. To determine whether expression of TACAN proteins alone is sufficient to generate an ion-conducting pore, we reconstituted isolated TACAN into lipid bilayers formed from synthetic lipids. After purification (see Table S2 for mass spectrometry analysis) and reconstitution in planar lipid bilayers, we measured the current across the membrane when voltage steps were imposed ( Figure 4 A). Addition of TACAN-containing proteoliposomes to the planar bilayer produced macroscopic currents ( Figures 4 A and S4 ), indicating that TACAN by itself can form an ion-conducting pore. Furthermore, the TACAN protein-elicited currents displayed Ohmic behavior ( Figures 4 B and 4C), similar to that observed in CHO cells expressing TACAN ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Finally, the TACAN channel was blocked by known blockers of MSCs, such as gadolinium (30 μM), which reduced the current to 21% and 36% of baseline at +80 mV and −80 mV, respectively ( Figures 4 D and 4E). The peptide GsMTx4 (5 μM), a MSC blocker purified from the venom of a Chilean rose tarantula, Grammostola spatulata ( Bae et al., 2011; Suchyna et al., 2000 3. Bae, C. ∙ Sachs, F. ∙ Gottlieb, P.A.

Physiol. 2000; 115 :583-598 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ), reduced the current to less than 1% of baseline. These blocker concentrations are similar to those known to inhibit endogenous MSCs ( Cho et al., 2006; Drew et al., 2002; Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009; Yang and Sachs, 1989 12.

Yang, X.C. ∙ Sachs, F. Block of stretch-activated ion channels in Xenopus oocytes by gadolinium and calcium ions Science. 1989; 243 :1068-1071 Crossref Scopus (723) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results indicate that TACAN forms an ion-conducting pore that is sensitive to known blockers of MSCs.
We next asked whether TACAN underlies the mechanosensitivity of nociceptors. Sensory DRG neurons were cultured from reporter mice in which nociceptors were visually identifiable through expression of tdTomato. Neurons were transfected with Alexa 488-labeled small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules targeting TACAN or a non-targeting (NT) control ( Figure 5 A). The knockdown was validated using a neuroblastoma (N2A) cell line ( Coste et al., 2010 14. Coste, B. ∙ Mathur, J. ∙ Schmidt, M. ... Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1967) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S5 A and S5B). Our data demonstrated that reducing the expression level of TACAN leads to a significant reduction in mechanically evoked currents in nociceptors ( Figures 5 B–5D). This decrease was accompanied by a significant reduction in the number of patches with active MSCs (44 of 54 [81%] in NT siRNA compared with 40 of 67 (59%) in TACAN siRNA-transfected nociceptors, Fisher’s exact probability test, p = 0.008). To determine whether mechanically evoked currents in nociceptors share the same pharmacological sensitivity as purified TACAN in synthetic lipids, we examined the nociceptors’ sensitivity to GsMTx4. Our data demonstrated that, in outside-out recordings from nociceptors, superfusion of GsMTx4 led to a significant and reversible block of mechanically evoked currents ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Importantly, the concentration used in this experiment was the same as the one used to block TACAN-elicited currents in the bilayer (5 μM).
Mechanically evoked whole-cell currents in nociceptors display unique non-adapting or ultra-slow adapting kinetics that distinguish them from the rapidly adapting currents recorded mainly in large-diameter, touch-sensitive mechanoreceptors ( Hao and Delmas, 2010 23. Hao, J. ∙ Delmas, P. Multiple desensitization mechanisms of mechanotransducer channels shape firing of mechanosensory neurons J. Neurosci. 2010; 30 :13384-13395 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). The latter has been associated with expression of Piezo2 ( Ranade et al., 2014b; Woo et al., 2015 47. Ranade, S.S. ∙ Woo, S.H. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ... Piezo2 is the major transducer of mechanical forces for touch sensation in mice Nature. 2014; 516 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (595) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Woo, S.H. ∙ Lukacs, V. ∙ de Nooij, J.C. ... Piezo2 is the principal mechanotransduction channel for proprioception Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :1756-1762 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether TACAN contributes to the ultra-slow adapting current in nociceptors, we recorded whole-cell mechanically evoked currents from DRG neurons obtained from wild-type mice, transfected with the same set of Alexa 488-labeled siRNA molecules. We defined three types of whole-cell currents based on their inactivation kinetics ( Figure 5 G; Francois et al., 2015 21. Francois, A. ∙ Schuetter, N. ∙ Laffray, S. ... The Low-Threshold Calcium Channel Cav3.2 Determines Low-Threshold Mechanoreceptor Function Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :370-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared with NT siRNA-transfected neurons (n = 21), treatment of DRG neurons with TACAN siRNA (n = 31) caused a significant (p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact probability test) decrease in the proportion of neurons displaying the ultra-slow adapting current ( Figure 5 H). We observed an increase, although non-significant, in the proportion of neurons displaying no or mixed currents in the TACAN siRNA-treated group, as predicted if the loss of TACAN converts ultra-slow adapting neurons into mixed or non-responders.
We next asked whether TACAN is necessary for detection of painful mechanical stimuli. We hypothesized that reducing TACAN expression would impair responses to high-intensity mechanical stimuli but not to low-intensity stimuli. Furthermore, the response to non-mechanical nociceptive stimuli, such as heat, should be unaffected. The difficulties in addressing this question are that (1) global knockout of TACAN is embryonically lethal and (2) the need for mechanotransduction during tissue morphogenesis ( Farge, 2011 19. Farge, E. Mechanotransduction in development Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2011; 95 :243-265 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ) is such that even tissue-specific embryonic deletion may affect neuronal pathfinding ( Jacques-Fricke et al., 2006 28. Jacques-Fricke, B.T. ∙ Seow, Y. ∙ Gottlieb, P.A. ... Ca2+ influx through mechanosensitive channels inhibits neurite outgrowth in opposition to other influx pathways and release from intracellular stores J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :5656-5664 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore generated a conditional, tamoxifen-inducible TACAN knockout mouse by crossing Mrgprd CreERT2 mice to TACAN floxed (TACAN fl/fl ) mice (termed TACAN cKO for simplicity). The Cre driver line was chosen because of the high co-labeling of TACAN-positive DRG neurons with the non-peptidergic population. Administration of tamoxifen caused a significant reduction in TACAN expression in this nociceptor population ( Figures S2 E–S2H).
In mice, the typical behavioral responses to hindpaw stimulation with mechanical stimuli of increasing intensity can be divided as follows: (1) no response; (2) detection, during which there is slight stretching of the digits without withdrawal; (3) reflex-type withdrawal; and (4) a nocifensive response consisting of withdrawal followed by licking of the hindpaw. Control mice included TACAN fl/fl with tamoxifen and Mrgprd CreERT2 TACAN fl/fl without tamoxifen. In the latter, mechanical stimulation of the hindpaw with increasing intensity led to an increase in the frequency of withdrawal reflexes until the intensity exceeded 1.00–1.40 g, after which these behavioral responses decreased and were replaced by nocifensive responses ( Figure 6 A). Interestingly, following tamoxifen injection (TACAN cKO ), the mice continued to display reflex-type withdrawals despite increasing stimulus intensity ( Figure 6 A). This was confirmed by a significant decrease in the nocifensive behaviors observed in the TACAN cKO mice following tamoxifen injection ( Figure 6 B). When examining the proportion of responses to a 1-g stimulus in TACAN fl/fl and TACAN cKO mice before and after administration of tamoxifen, we observed a significant decrease in nocifensive responses ( Figure 6 C). This indicates that the expression of TACAN in non-peptidergic nociceptors contributes to the sensation of mechanical pain. In its absence, high-intensity mechanical stimuli would only produce reflex-type responses.
Because the expression of TACAN at the mRNA level indicates a distribution that extends to other subsets of DRG neurons, including mechanoreceptors ( Zeisel et al., 2018 60. Zeisel, A. ∙ Hochgerner, H. ∙ Lonnerberg, P. ... Molecular Architecture of the Mouse Nervous System Cell. 2018; 174 :999-1014.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1503) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined whether reducing its expression in a broader population would also generate defects in touch sensing. We injected AAV2/6 viral particles expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting TACAN or a NT control directly into the left sciatic nerve bundle of wild-type (WT) mice. We hypothesized that knocking down TACAN expression in mechanoreceptors would affect the withdrawal reflex as well. Knockdown of TACAN by the virus was validated in F11 cells ( Figures S5 C and S5D). However, again, despite the fact that broader knockdown was produced, the reduction in TACAN expression specifically affected nocifensive responses and had no effect on reflex withdrawals ( Figure 6 D). Finally, to account for a partial knockdown effect of the shRNA virus, we repeated the procedure and injected AAV particles carrying the Cre recombinase under the synapsin promoter in the sciatic nerve bundle of TACAN fl/fl mice. Again, the behavioral phenotype was specific loss of nocifensive responses to mechanical stimuli ( Figure 6 E).
Interestingly, the loss of nocifensive responses in the absence of TACAN was specific to mechanical stimuli because the same mice continued to exhibit normal nociceptive responses to painful thermal stimuli (Hargreaves’ test; Figures S5 F and S5I). Finally, reflexive paw withdrawal from a pinprick stimulus, a model of intense mechanical pain stimuli depending on peptidergic A-δ nociceptors ( Arcourt et al., 2017 2. Arcourt, A. ∙ Gorham, L. ∙ Dhandapani, R. ... Touch Receptor-Derived Sensory Information Alleviates Acute Pain Signaling and Fine-Tunes Nociceptive Reflex Coordination Neuron. 2017; 93 :179-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ), was not different in the two groups ( Figures S5 G and S5J), suggesting that A-δ nociceptors may express a MSC other than TACAN. Taken together, these data indicate that TACAN is involved in detection of painful mechanical stimuli.

Section: Discussion

Despite recent advances in understanding the ionic mechanisms responsible for our sense of hearing ( Pan et al., 2018 43. Pan, B. ∙ Akyuz, N. ∙ Liu, X.P. ... TMC1 Forms the Pore of Mechanosensory Transduction Channels in Vertebrate Inner Ear Hair Cells Neuron. 2018; 99 :736-753.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ), touch ( Ranade et al., 2014b 47. Ranade, S.S. ∙ Woo, S.H. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ... Piezo2 is the major transducer of mechanical forces for touch sensation in mice Nature. 2014; 516 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (595) PubMed Google Scholar ), and proprioception ( Woo et al., 2015 57. Woo, S.H. ∙ Lukacs, V. ∙ de Nooij, J.C. ... Piezo2 is the principal mechanotransduction channel for proprioception Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :1756-1762 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ), the mechanisms responsible for our sense of mechanical pain have remained elusive. In this study, we identified an ion channel that is specifically involved in sensing painful mechanical stimuli without affecting sensitivity to touch or heat stimuli.
For a candidate channel to be considered intrinsically mechanosensitive, it should (1) be expressed in mechanosensitive cells; (2) be expressed at the plasma membrane; (3) increase mechanosensitivity when expressed in heterologous systems; (4) require gating stimuli similar to those in native cells (nociceptors); (5) display rapid opening (<5 ms); (6) cause a decrease in mechanosensitivity when its expression is reduced in native cells; (7) form an ion-conducting pore when reconstituted in synthetic membranes and remain gated by mechanical stimuli; and (8) its deletion in vivo should cause mechanosensing defects ( Christensen and Corey, 2007; Vollrath et al., 2007 13. Christensen, A.P. ∙ Corey, D.P. TRP channels in mechanosensation: direct or indirect activation? Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8 :510-521 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Vollrath, M.A. ∙ Kwan, K.Y. ∙ Corey, D.P. The micromachinery of mechanotransduction in hair cells Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30 :339-365 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our results indicate that TACAN satisfies at least 7 of these 8 conditions. It increases cell-attached and whole-cell mechanically induced currents in heterologous systems, and its downregulation impairs the mechanosensitivity of nociceptors. The purified TACAN protein reconstituted in synthetic lipids forms a functional channel that is blocked by known MSC blockers. Finally, reducing or knocking out TACAN expression in sensory neurons selectively impairs the ability of mice to sense painful mechanical stimuli without affecting their sensitivity to touch or heat. Loss of nocifensive responses to mechanical stimuli when TACAN is removed in the adult is similar to ablation of Mrgprd-positive non-peptidergic nociceptive fibers in the adult mouse, where the frequency of withdrawals to an ascending set of von Frey filaments becomes significantly different when the filament intensity exceeds 1.0 g ( Cavanaugh et al., 2009 8. Cavanaugh, D.J. ∙ Lee, H. ∙ Lo, L. ... Distinct subsets of unmyelinated primary sensory fibers mediate behavioral responses to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :9075-9080 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, in single-channel recordings, the conductance values for TACAN were higher in bilayers than in cell lines. This could be due to the fact that, in the bilayer system, the channel is purified and does not have any interacting partners that could affect its conductance. Although the high conductance observed in single-channel openings in the bilayer recordings may be reminiscent of porins, their presence in the bilayer preparation is unlikely because (1) they were not detected in the mass spectrometry analysis; (2) porin conductance (0.8–4.0 nS) ( Kreir et al., 2008; Mahendran et al., 2010; Trias and Benz, 1993 30. Kreir, M. ∙ Farre, C. ∙ Beckler, M. ... Rapid screening of membrane protein activity: electrophysiological analysis of OmpF reconstituted in proteoliposomes Lab Chip. 2008; 8 :587-595 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Mahendran, K.R. ∙ Kreir, M. ∙ Weingart, H. ... Permeation of antibiotics through Escherichia coli OmpF and OmpC porins: screening for influx on a single-molecule level J. Biomol. Screen. 2010; 15 :302-307 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Trias, J. ∙ Benz, R. Characterization of the channel formed by the mycobacterial porin in lipid bilayer membranes. Demonstration of voltage gating and of negative point charges at the channel mouth J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 :6234-6240 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) is much higher than the one observed here; and (3) porins tend to close at high membrane voltages, whereas this channel remains linear. Furthermore, our macroscopic currents were sensitive to GsMTx4 and GdCl3.
Naturally, we were not able to apply mechanical stimuli to the purified TACAN in the planar lipid bilayer and therefore cannot comment on its intrinsic mechanosensitivity. Nonetheless, given that membrane tension is proportional to the radius of curvature ( Sachs and Morris, 1998 48. Sachs, F. ∙ Morris, C.E. Mechanosensitive ion channels in nonspecialized cells Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 132 :1-77 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), one would expect the planar bilayer to exert enough tension to maintain the channel in the open configuration ( Figure S4 ). Future experiments in reconstituted proteoliposomes are needed to test whether TACAN has intrinsic mechanosensitive properties or needs other proteins.
It was recently proposed that the MSC Piezo2 mediates sensitivity to mechanical pain in mice ( Murthy et al., 2018b 37. Murthy, S.E. ∙ Loud, M.C. ∙ Daou, I. ... The mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo2 mediates sensitivity to mechanical pain in mice Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar ) because its deletion in all caudal sensory neurons (HoxB8 Cre ;;Piezo2 fl/fl mice) impaired nocifensive responses to painful mechanical stimuli. However, several lines of evidence complicate interpretation of those findings: (1) the gait phenotype of mice is significantly impaired (Video S4 in Woo et al., 2015 57. Woo, S.H. ∙ Lukacs, V. ∙ de Nooij, J.C. ... Piezo2 is the principal mechanotransduction channel for proprioception Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :1756-1762 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ), (2) the slow-adapting currents are not affected in nociceptors, and (3) embryonic deletion of Piezo2 may disrupt proper development of the nervous system. Furthermore, two recent studies support a role for Piezo2 in transducing touch but not pain ( Szczot et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019 53. Szczot, M. ∙ Liljencrantz, J. ∙ Ghitani, N. ... PIEZO2 mediates injury-induced tactile pain in mice and humans Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Zhang, M. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Geng, J. ... Mechanically Activated Piezo Channels Mediate Touch and Suppress Acute Mechanical Pain Response in Mice Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :1419-1431.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ).
TACAN defines a previously uncharacterized class of ion channels. Much like the Piezo family of MSC, which was found to be involved in touch ( Ranade et al., 2014b 47. Ranade, S.S. ∙ Woo, S.H. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ... Piezo2 is the major transducer of mechanical forces for touch sensation in mice Nature. 2014; 516 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (595) PubMed Google Scholar ), proprioception ( Woo et al., 2015 57.

Neurosci. 2015; 18 :1756-1762 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ), lung inflation ( Nonomura et al., 2017 40. Nonomura, K. ∙ Woo, S.H. ∙ Chang, R.B. ... Piezo2 senses airway stretch and mediates lung inflation-induced apnoea Nature. 2017; 541 :176-181 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ), vascular development ( Ranade et al., 2014a 46. Ranade, S.S. ∙ Qiu, Z. ∙ Woo, S.H. ... Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel, is required for vascular development in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :10347-10352 Crossref Scopus (613) PubMed Google Scholar ), and red blood cell volume regulation ( Cahalan et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2018 7. Cahalan, S.M. ∙ Lukacs, V. ∙ Ranade, S.S. ... Piezo1 links mechanical forces to red blood cell volume eLife. 2015; 4 :e07370 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar 33.

Common PIEZO1 Allele in African Populations Causes RBC Dehydration and Attenuates Plasmodium Infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ), TACAN is expressed in many tissues and is likely to play important roles in several mechanotransduction processes. TACAN also has a homolog in mammalian cells, TMEM120B, but its heterologous expression did not increase mechanically evoked currents ( Figures S3 I–S3K). Our bilayer reconstitution experiments indicate that TACAN can form an ion channel by itself but that TMEM120B may act as an accessory subunit to TACAN.
Activation of nociceptors is central to the experience of pain, and several chronic pain conditions are caused by the sensitization of nociceptors to mechanical stimuli, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis pain ( He et al., 2017; McQueen et al., 1991; Neogi et al., 2016; Okun et al., 2012; Schaible, 2014 25.

Schaible, H.G. Nociceptive neurons detect cytokines in arthritis Arthritis Res. Ther. 2014; 16 :470 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intervening at the level of primary afferent nociceptors is a promising approach to developing therapeutic treatments. However, pain management in many of these chronic inflammatory conditions is currently inadequate, in part because the identity of the ion channels involved in pain transduction has remained elusive. With the discovery of TACAN, we identified a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain.

Adult male C57BL/6 mice (8-12 weeks old, Jackson Laboratories) were housed in a temperature-controlled room under a 12h light/dark cycle. Water and food were available ad libitum .
TRPV1-cre mice (B6.129- Trpv1 tm1(cre)Bbm /J, Stock #017769) were crossed to the tdTomato (tdTom) reporter line B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze /J (B6.129- Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm1Joe /J, Stock # 007909) to produce mice in which nociceptors express tdTomato (termed Trpv1-tdTom ). Mice expressing an inducible Cre recombinase in non-peptidergic nociceptors Mrgprd CreERT2 were obtained from Dr. Wenqin Luo (Jackson labs stock #031286) and crossed to TACAN floxed mice, in which loxP sites were introduced upstream of exon 2 and downstream of exon 3. Tamoxifen (Sigma #T5668; 100mg + 0.5ml EtOH 100% + 9.5ml sunflower oil (Sigma), sonicated 45 min, and stored at −20°C for a maximum of 1 month) was prepared in a 10 mg/ml solution and injected twice daily for 5 days at 50mg/kg.
Collection of human dorsal root ganglia was approved by the ethical review board at McGill University (IRB#s A04-M53-08B) in collaboration with Transplant Quebec Organ Donation. After receiving appropriate consent, DRGs were collected in NMDG-aCSF following thoracolumbar spine harvest (T10/11 to L5/S1) no longer than 3 hours after aortic cross-clamp. The donor was a 68 year old male who died of stroke, without any history of chronic pain.
COS7 (ATCC, #CRL-1651) or HEK293 (tsA201) (a gift from Dr. D. Bowie, McGill University) cells were grown in 35mm dishes to 70%–80% confluency and transfected with a bicistronic vector expressing TACAN-HA and EGFP (or empty EGFP control vector) using FuGene HD transfection reagent (Promega, #E2311). On the following day, cells were split at low confluency (5%–10%) on 35mm tissue culture treated μ-dishes (Ibidi, #80136). Electrophysiology recordings were done 48 to 72 h post-transfection.
Piezo1 KO HEK293 cells were obtained from the lab of Dr. A. Patapoutian, Scripps Research Institute.
CHO cells were transfected with a P2A bicistronic vector simultaneously expressing (N-terminal) HA-tagged human TACAN and nuclear TdTomato (pCMV-NLS-tdTom-P2A-2HA-TACAN = HA-TACAN), or with a control vector expressing nuclear TdTomato alone (pCMV-NLS-tdTom-P2A-2HA = MOCK). Selection media supplied with 800 μg/mL G418 was added 24h post-transfection. On the second day post-transfection, the cells were plated at high dilution (1:150) in 10 cm dishes. One week post transfection, a total of eight colonies were collected and grown in separate dishes. Expression levels of TACAN protein were measured for each clone by western blot using an anti-HA antibody.
DRGs from 8-12 week old male mice were dissected, dissociated and cultured as follows: freshly dissected DRGs were initially stored in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Wisent, #311-511-CL), then enzymatically dissociated by incubating first with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Wisent, #325-043-EL) for 20 minutes at 37°C, then with collagenase type I (Biochrom, # C 1-28; 2 mg/ml) and dispase II protease (Sigma, #D4693; 5 mg/ml) in HBSS for 30-40 minutes at 37°C. The suspension was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 800 rpm, the enzymatic solution was removed and replaced with 200 μl of DRG culture media (for composition, see Hu and Lewin, 2006 27. Hu, J. ∙ Lewin, G.R. Mechanosensitive currents in the neurites of cultured mouse sensory neurones J. Physiol. 2006; 577 :815-828 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). DRG neurons were mechanically separated by trituration and plated on poly-L-lysine- (100 μg/ml) and laminin- (20 μg/ml) coated 35 mm glass-bottom FluoroDishes (World Precision Instruments Inc., #FD3510-100) and incubated at 37°C.
We used the ViewRNA ISH assay from Affymetrix (Affymetrix eBioscience # QVT0012) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, freshly dissected DRGs were embedded in an optimum cutting temperature medium (Tissue Tek, O.C.T. Compound, #4583) and placed on dry ice. 14 μm thick sections were cut on a cryostat (Leica, Germany) at −20°C, mounted onto slides and fixed in 10% normal buffer formalin overnight. The tissue was dehydrated, baked and digested for 20 minutes with Protease QF. Following protease treatment, the sections were incubated for 3h at 40°C with a target probe set designed to hybridize with mouse TACAN (accession number # NM_172541 ) or with no target probe added for the negative control slides. The signal was amplified through sequential hybridization with preamplifier and amplifier mixes and revealed by hybridization with label probe oligonucleotides conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and precipitation of Fast Red Substrate. Finally, the sections were stained with DAPI, counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin and mounted using Advantage Mounting Medium (Innovex Biosciences Inc, # NB300).
The RNAscope® LS Duplex Assay (Red/Green) (322440, 322550), purchased from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD, a Bio-Techne brand), was performed at the MIRC Core Histology Facility (Hamilton, ON) on a Leica Bond RX. Ganglia were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol for Fresh Frozen samples and sectioned to 14 μm prior to staining. Sample RNA quality and background staining were assessed with positive (320868) and negative control probes (320878). Target staining was performed with probes for TMEM120A (551688) and TRPV1 (415388-C2). Counterstaining was performed with Gill’s Hematoxylin I and slides were mounted with Vectamount.
The mRNA TACAN and P2X3 were analyzed from slides of fresh frozen sections from WT and MrgdCre x Tacan flox (Tamoxifen treated) brains fixed for 15 minutes in cold 4% PFA (prepared in 1xPBS) using the advanced cell diagnostics RNAscope fluorescent multiplex reagent kit (ACD, Newark,USA, cat# 320850). After fixation, the sections were dehydrated in ethanol and pretreated with Protease IV (ACD cat 322340, lot 2006478) at room temperature for 30 minutes. Pretreated sections were incubated for 2 hours at 40°C in ACD HybEZ oven (ACD cat# 241000) with RNAscope probes against TACAN (Mm Tmem120a – C1, ACD reference 513211, lot 19066C) and P2X3 (Mm P2rx3 – C2, ACD ref 521611-C2, lot 19101D). Control slides were treated with a mouse Positive Control Probe (ACD ref 320881, lot 19099A) and 3-Plex negative control probe (ACD ref 320871, lot 19162A). The signal was amplified through a series of three sequential hybridization steps using amplification reagents included in the Fluorescent Multiplex Detection Reagents Kit (cat 320851, lot 2006207). The final amplification reagent (Amp 4-FL-Alt C) included fluorophores Atto 647 (revealing P2X3) and Atto 550 (revealing TACAN). Finally, the sections were stained with DAPI and mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, ref P36930, lot 2046607) on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides (cat 12-550-15).
A custom polyclonal antibody against peptide RPSLPSESMEAAQELENQMKERQG (aa 68-92) was produced in rabbit by standard methods (MediMabs). TACAN antibody was affinity purified by incubating the serum with an antigen peptide bound to a PVDF membrane (prepared based on the pMAL Protein Fusion and Purification System, New England Biolabs).
To determine which population of sensory fibers expresses TACAN in mice, DRGs were processed for immunohistochemistry using antibodies against TACAN in combination with those against either NF200, CGRP, GINIP, P2X3 and TH to label myelinated fibers, peptidergic sensory fibers, non-peptidergic fibers, and two subpopulations of non-peptidergic fibers: MRGPRD nociceptors and C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), respectively. The lectin IB4 was used to identify non-peptidergic sensory fibers and Nissl stain was used to label cell bodies of DRG neurons. DRGs were embedded in O.C.T. and 14-μm thick sections were cut on a cryostat (Leica, Germany) at −20°C and slide mounted directly. All sections were washed for 30 min with PBS containing 0.2% Triton-X (PBS-T), incubated in 50% ethanol for 30 min and washed in PBS-T. Depending on the species in which the secondary antibody was raised in, the tissue was either blocked in 10% normal donkey or normal goat serum for 1 h. Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations – anti-TACAN (1:1000; rabbit polyclonal, affinity purified, MediMabs), anti-NF200 (1:1000, mouse polyclonal, Sigma, #N4142), anti-CGRP (1:1000, mouse monoclonal, Sigma, #C7113), anti-GINIP (1:1000, rat polyclonal, a gift from Dr. Aziz Moqrich; Gaillard et al., 2014 22. Gaillard, S. ∙ Lo Re, L. ∙ Mantilleri, A. ... GINIP, a Gαi-interacting protein, functions as a key modulator of peripheral GABAB receptor-mediated analgesia Neuron. 2014; 84 :123-136 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), anti-P2X3 (1:5000, guinea pig polyclonal, Neuromics, #GP10108), anti-TH (1:250, chicken polyclonal, Abcam, #ab76442), and IB4 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200, ThermoFisher Scientific) made in 5% blocking serum (goat or donkey) in PBS-T and left to incubate overnight on the shaker at 4°C. To test for anti-TACAN specificity, DRG sections were co-incubated with the synthetic blocking peptide (1:200; MediMabs). Following 30 min of washes with PBS-T, the tissue was incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in PBS-T for 2 h at room temperature– goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:800, ThermoFisher Scientific), goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (1:800, ThermoFisher Scientific), goat anti-rat conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500, ThermoFisher Scientific), goat anti-chicken conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (1:100, ThermoFisher Scientific), or donkey anti-mouse conjugated to Rhodamine Red X (1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch). To label all DRG neurons, sections were incubated with the red fluorescent Nissl stain NeuroTrace 530/615 (1:200, ThermoFischer #N21482) for 20 min at room temperature. Following 30 min of washes, all slides were mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences Inc., #18606-20).
Representative images were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with Ar and He-Ne lasers using a 20x water-immersion objectives. Images used for quantifications were taken on a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 fluorescence photomicroscope (Zeiss Canada) using a 10x objective.
Extracellular neuronal bath solution (pH 7.40 and 303 mOsm) consisted of (in mM): NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl 2 2, MgCl 2 2, HEPES 10, and Glucose 10. For whole-cell and outside-out recordings, the electrode contained a solution (pH 7.20 and 302 mOsm) consisting of (in mM): K-Gluconate 123, KCl 10, MgCl 2 1, HEPES 10, EGTA 1, CaCl 2 0.1, K 2 ATP 1, Na 4 ATP 0.2, and Glucose 4. For cell-attached recordings, the recording electrode was filled with the same solution as the extracellular neuronal bath. Electrodes were made using fire-polished glass electrodes (AM Systems, Glass Borosilicate, 1.5 mm OD, 0.86 ID) with resistances of 1.5-2 MOhms (cell-attached), 1.5-3.5 MOhms (outside-out), and 4-8 MOhms (whole-cell).
Observations were made on Olympus IX71 inverted microscope with a MultiClamp 700B (Axon CNS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) as amplifier and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices) as digitizer. Membrane current and voltage were amplified and acquired via the MultiClamp and Digidata and were sampled at 10 kHz; signals were recorded with Clampex10 and MultiClamp 700B software. In whole-cell recordings, pipette and membrane capacitance were compensated for with the auto function of Clampex10. The electrode holder was connected to a high-speed pressure clamp and Pressure-Vacuum pump (HSPC, ALA Scientific) for pressure-pulse recording protocols, such that pressure stimuli were delivered directly through the recording electrode, as previously described ( Peyronnet et al., 2012 44. Peyronnet, R. ∙ Sharif-Naeini, R. ∙ Folgering, J.H. ... Mechanoprotection by polycystins against apoptosis is mediated through the opening of stretch-activated K(2P) channels Cell Rep. 2012; 1 :241-250 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mechanical stimulation protocols were written in Clampex10, and performed by the HSPC, with less than a 10ms rise time from no applied pressure to intended magnitude of pressure. The threshold amplitude for accepting an opening event was set at 50%. The minimum duration of open events was set at 100 μs, in concordance with previous standards ( Cho et al., 2002 11. Cho, H. ∙ Shin, J. ∙ Shin, C.Y. ... Mechanosensitive ion channels in cultured sensory neurons of neonatal rats J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 :1238-1247 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). For the majority of cell-attached recordings, membrane voltage was held at −80 mV to generate more discernable mechanically evoked channel openings. Each cell membrane patch was subjected to 11 sweeps of incrementally increasing negative pressure from 0 mm Hg to −100 mm Hg, at 10 mm Hg increments. Images of cell soma were taken at 40X with a CCD camera (QImaging, QI Click) connected to the microscope. Images were saved and analyzed with Olympus MetaMorph Advanced software.
Mouse DRG cultures were prepared as previously described ( Francois et al., 2015 21. Francois, A. ∙ Schuetter, N. ∙ Laffray, S. ... The Low-Threshold Calcium Channel Cav3.2 Determines Low-Threshold Mechanoreceptor Function Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :370-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, male adult mice (8-12 weeks) were anesthetized and perfused with cold HBSS. DRG were removed and enzymatically digested with 5 mg/ml dispase (ThermoFisher Scientific #17105041) and 2 mg/ml collagenase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific #17101-015) at 37°C for 40 minutes. DRGs were then rinsed with Neuro Basal A media (Thermo Fisher Scientific #21103049) with B27 supplement, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin. After mechanical dissociation with syringes of decreasing diameter (18 G, 21 G and 26 G), neurons were plated on 35 mm dishes (Ibidi #80136) previously coated with Poly-L-ornithine and laminin. One hour later, media was replaced by complete Neuro Basal A media (with growth factors: 10 ng/ml NT4, 2 ng/ml GDNF and 200 ng/mL NGF; ThermoFisher). 72 hours after transfection with siRNA (see TACAN knockdown section below), whole-cell patch clamp was performed on Alexa 488 and IB4 (anti IB4-Alexa 594 1/2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific #I21413) positive neurons. The extracellular solution contained (in mM): 10 glucose, 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl 2 , pH 7.30. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 127 K-Gluconate, 10 NaCl, 5 KCl, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 5 Creatine P (Na), 1 CaCl 2 , 10 EGTA, 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, pH 7.20. Cells were patched in the voltage-clamp whole-cell configuration, maintained at −60 mV, and mechanically stimulated with a blunt glass pipette attached to a piezo-electric device (PZ-150 M; Burleigh) as previously described ( Francois et al., 2015 21. Francois, A. ∙ Schuetter, N. ∙ Laffray, S. ... The Low-Threshold Calcium Channel Cav3.2 Determines Low-Threshold Mechanoreceptor Function Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :370-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were stimulated during 2 s with increasing indentation steps of 1 μm at two speeds: 80 and 800 μm/s for slow and fast stimulation, respectively during the ramp segment of the command for both forward and backward motions. The time constants of MS current decay were fitted to exponentials as in Delfini et al. (2013) 15. Delfini, M.C. ∙ Mantilleri, A. ∙ Gaillard, S. ... TAFA4, a chemokine-like protein, modulates injury-induced mechanical and chemical pain hypersensitivity in mice Cell Rep. 2013; 5 :378-388 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar . These descriptors were used to classify the proportion of different mechanically-activated current adaptations in rapidly, mixed and slowly adapting categories.
Positive masters and pillar array casting were described previously ( Poole et al., 2014; Sianati et al., 2019 45. Poole, K. ∙ Herget, R. ∙ Lapatsina, L. ... Tuning Piezo ion channels to detect molecular-scale movements relevant for fine touch Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3520 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Sianati, S. ∙ Kurumlian, A. ∙ Bailey, E. ... Analysis of Mechanically Activated Ion Channels at the Cell-Substrate Interface: Combining Pillar Arrays and Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2019; 7 :47 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, negative masters were cast in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, mixed at a ratio of 1:10, cured at 110°C for 15 min) from positive silicon masters silanised with vapor phase Trichloro (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane (Sigma-Alrich). Negative masters were then silanised (as above) and used to cast pillar arrays, also in PDMS, ratio 1:10, cured at 110°C for 60 min. Before seeding cells (Piezo1-knockout cells with or without transfected TACAN), pillar arrays were activated using a low pressure Zepto plasma system (Diener, Germany). Cells were seeded at a concentration of 2 × 10 4 cells/mL in complete media, transiently transfected using Fugene HD (as per manufacturer’s instructions) and incubated overnight.
Whole-cell patch pipettes were prepared from thick-walled filamented glass using a pipette puller fitted with a box filament (P-1000, Sutter Instruments, USA). Pipettes were heat-polished to give a final resistance of 3 MΩ – 6 MΩ, and filled with a solution containing 110 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3). Extracellular solutions contained 140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Whole-cell patch-clamp data was obtained on an Axopatch 200B with pClamp 10 software. Data were analyzed using Clampfit software (Molecular Devices, USA). Pipette and membrane capacitance were compensated and to minimize voltage errors, series resistance was compensated by at least 60%. Mechanically-activated currents were recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV. Multiple mechanical stimuli ranging between 1 nm–1 μm were applied to cells by serially deflecting an individual pilus using a blunt, heat-polished pipette driven by a MM3A-LS micromanipulator (Kleindiek Nanotechnik, Germany). Bright-field images of the deflected pilus were collected with a Nikon T i -E inverted microscope using a 40 × objective (NA 0.6) and the center of each pilus was calculated off line by applying a 2D-Gaussian fit of intensity values (Igor, Wavemetrics, USA). Pillar deflection was subsequently calculated from successive images by comparing the difference in the calculated center point.
For outside-out recordings, patches were subjected to incrementally increasing levels of positive pressure until they reached a threshold opening (with pressure increments of 5 mm Hg). Once threshold was reached, the patch was subjected to that threshold pressure for 10 sweeps. Superfusion through a fast solution exchanger (SF-77B, Warner Instruments) was set-up in the dish so that a constant stream of external bath solution or 5μM GsMTx4 dissolved in external bath solution was directed toward the recording electrode, with the perfusion line ∼2 mm away from the electrode. An initial 10-sweep pressure pulse protocol was performed in the presence of external bath solution. Following ∼30 s of GsMTx4 perfusion (to allow for adequate GsMTx4 insertion into the membrane), another 10-sweep protocol was performed. Finally, 5-10 minutes after wash with external bath solution, a 10-sweep protocol was performed on the same outside-out patch. GsMTx-4 is a 34-residue peptide extracted from the Grammostola spatulata tarantula toxin that blocks stretch-activated ion channels ( Chen et al., 1996 10. Chen, Y. ∙ Simasko, S.M. ∙ Niggel, J. ... Ca2+ uptake in GH3 cells during hypotonic swelling: the sensory role of stretch-activated ion channels Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270 :C1790-C1798 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and was purchased commercially (Tocris cat. #4912). The peptide was dissolved in saline in stocks of 50μM and stored at −80°C.
Bilayers were formed in polyethylene chips featuring a 150μm diameter aperture by brushing a solution of 10mg/ml Di-phitanoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) diluted in decane over the aperture. We exclusively used synthetic lipids to prevent any contamination with other proteins from a lipid purification process. Thinning of the bilayer was monitored via membrane capacitance.
TACAN channels were reconstituted by mixing POPE:POPG (3:1) small unilamellar vesicles with the purified channels in solution (1:4 by weight protein:lipid), and removing the detergent by dialysis over 5 days as described previously ( Faure et al., 2012 20. Faure, É. ∙ Starek, G. ∙ McGuire, H. ... A limited 4 Å radial displacement of the S4-S5 linker is sufficient for internal gate closing in Kv channels J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :40091-40098 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Channels were fused by adding 1μl of the proteoliposome suspension to one chamber and monitoring fusion by current increase. Electrophysiological recording was performed with an Axopatch 200A amplifier and the GPatch software suite (UCLA Department of Anesthesiology). Currents were analyzed using Analysis Software (UCLA Department of Anesthesiology). For macroscopic currents, we used solutions containing in mM, cis : 150 NaCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.40) and trans: 150 KCl, 10 HEPES, (pH 7.40). For single-channel recordings, we used used solutions containing in mM, cis : 500 NaCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.40) and trans: 500 KCl, 10 HEPES, (pH 7.40).
For reconstitution in artificial bilayers, human TACAN was inserted into a pET28a vector, with a N-terminal His tag (6x) followed by a thrombin cleavage site. TACAN-pET28a was transformed into E. coli DE3-pLys (Rosetta) competent cells. 100mL of pre-culture was grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with 50μg/mL kanamycin at 37°C in an incubator shaking at a speed of 240 rpm. 1-4L of culture was inoculated with 10mL of pre-culture. Once OD 0.8 was reached (> 3h), IPTG (final concentration of 0.5 mM) and glycerol 50mL/L culture (∼5%) were added to induce TACAN expression. Best induction was achieved at 20°C for > 5hrs ( Figure S6 A). Cells were harvested by centrifuging cultures at ∼4000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Pellets were pooled, washed once and resuspended at a concentration of 1/7 g/mL with resuspension buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 10% glycerol, pH adjusted to 7.50 with KOH) containing 1 pellet of protease inhibitor (mini complete EDTA-free, Sigma #11836170001). The suspension was kept on ice at all times.
After homogeneous resuspension by agitation, the cells were lysed by passing through a cell disrupter (Emulsiflex C5, Avestin, Ottawa) 3 times at 15,000psi. Unbroken cells and debris were subsequently removed by centrifugation at 18,000 g for 15min at 4°C. The supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 160,000 g for 2h at 4°C and the pellet (membranes) was collected. Membranes were resuspended in 2mL/L of culture IMAC-buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Fos-choline-14, pH adjusted to 7.50 with KOH), transferred into a homogenizer and homogenized mechanically. Fos-choline-14 (2%, Avanti) was added and agitated for 2h at 4°C. Non-soluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 30 min.
Proteins were bound to Co-resin (Talon superflow) and washed with 25mM imidazole in a FPLC (Äkta purifier). Following a careful wash in the presence of 25 mM imidazole, the protein was eluted at 400 mM imidazole and concentrated. TACAN was further purified by size-exclusion. The sample was passed through a G75 column (buffer: 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 5% glycerol, 0.02% Fos-choline-14, pH adjusted to 7.50 with KOH). TACAN was collected at the 9.2ml fraction. Purity and size were confirmed by western blot ( Figure S6 A).
Purified TACAN was digested with trypsin and analyzed by tandem MS/MS (see table S2). All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.3.01). Mascot was set up to search the MiscService_02_May_2014_10_05_42 database (unknown version, 21 entries) assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.50 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 15 PPM. Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine, carbamidomethylation of cysteine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were specified in Mascot as variable modifications.
Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.8.2, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at a probability greater than 95.0% by the Peptide Prophet algorithm ( Keller et al., 2002 29. Keller, A. ∙ Nesvizhskii, A.I. ∙ Kolker, E. ... Empirical statistical model to estimate the accuracy of peptide identifications made by MS/MS and database search Anal. Chem. 2002; 74 :5383-5392 Crossref Scopus (4070) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Scaffold delta-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at a probability greater than 99.0% and contained at least 1 identified peptide. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm ( Nesvizhskii et al., 2003 39. Nesvizhskii, A.I. ∙ Keller, A. ∙ Kolker, E. ... A statistical model for identifying proteins by tandem mass spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2003; 75 :4646-4658 Crossref Scopus (3854) PubMed Google Scholar ). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. TACAN was identified by 130/376 amino acids (35% coverage) and no decoys were identified ( Figure S6 B).
CHO cells stably expressing HA-TACAN (and TdTomato) were grown in alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep and 400 μg/mL (0.8mM) G418. At P17, they were trypsinized, plated on Poly-D-Lysine-coated glass coverslips and incubated for 24 h.
CHO cells were incubated in DiI (1:200 in their respective media) for 10 min at 37°C. Following DiI staining, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4°C. They were then incubated in 0.5% tritonX for 20 min to permeabilize the membranes. Next, they were blocked in 10% NGST for 1h at room temperature. Incubation with an anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000 in NGST; Invitrogen #71-5500) took place overnight at 4°C. The next day, the cells were incubated with an AlexaFluor-488 goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500 in NGST) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides for imaging. All dilutions were done in PBS unless otherwise indicated, and cells were rinsed with PBS 2-3 times after each step except for the blocking step.
Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 63x oil objective. A focal plane through the center of the cell was selected based on the DiI staining of the membrane. The stably transfected CHO cells were identified by their nuclear tdTomato signal. All analysis was done using ImageJ. First, a mask was created from the red channel by thresholding the image, converting to binary, getting an outline of the cell and inverting the image such that the membrane, as defined by the DiI staining, appeared as a one-pixel thick outline. Black pixels that were clearly not part of the membrane were manually erased using the paintbrush tool. The resulting image was subtracted from the green channel so that only the HA signal at the membrane remained. A freehand ROI was drawn around each cell of interest such that it encompassed the entire membrane of the cell. The values of the pixel intensity within this ROI were extracted and an average overall nonzero pixel intensity was taken to determine the average intensity of pixels around the membrane.
CHO stable cell lines (MOCK and HA-TACAN = TACAN) were grown on 60mm dishes to 70% confluency. Briefly, the cells were washed with ice cold PBS-CM and incubated for 30 minutes on ice, in the dark with a 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Thermo-Scientific, #21331) diluted in PBS-CM pH 8.0. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by quenching with 50 mM glycine diluted in PBS-CM and the cells were lysed in 250 μL RIPA lysis buffer. The cells were harvested by scraping and collected in microcentrifuge tubes. The lysates were incubated on a rocker at 4°C for 1h. After 20 min of centrifugation at 12,000 g, the supernatant was collected and protein concentration measured according to the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit I (# 5000111). Equal protein amounts of each sample were incubated overnight at 4°C with Neutravidin Agarose Resin (Thermo-Scientific, #29200). The following day, the resin was washed four times in RIPA buffer and bound proteins were denatured in Laemmli – 0.1M DTT. Biotinylated samples and cell lysates were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Immobilon, #IPVH00010). Western blot was performed by blocking the membranes in 5% skim milk-PBS and subsequently incubating for 4h at room temperature with 1:2000 mouse anti-HA (Covance #MMS-101P) and 1:8000 anti beta-tubulin rabbit (Novus Biologicals #NB600-936) followed by secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies 1:10 000 (Jackson Immuno Research, #115-036-062 and #111-035-144) for 1 h.
DRG cultures were grown on 35 mm dishes. On the 3rd day, they were treated with complexes of predesigned siRNA directed against mouse TACAN (QIAGEN FlexiTube siRNA final concentration 100nM, #Mm MGI:2686991.1) and 2ul of HiPerFect transfection reagent. The cells were incubated with the transfection complexes for 48 to 72 hours with addition of fresh media 24 h post-transfection.
For in vivo knockdown of TACAN, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the left sciatic nerve bundle was surgically exposed. We injected two 1 μL doses of a self-complementary adeno-associated virus (sc-AAV, serotype 6, Vector Biolabs) expressing CMV-GFP and U6-shRNA targeting mouse TACAN (genome copies: 1.6x10 12 GC/mL; GenBank RefSeq: NM_172541) or a non-targeting control (genome copies: 1.0x10 12 GC/mL). The injection was performed using a graduated 5 μL PCR glass micropipette (Drummond®) pulled to a fine point. The two viral doses were injected in two different sites on the nerve bundle and the pipette was pulled after 2 min. Skin was sutured using silk suture (PERMA-HAND) and the animal was monitored for an hour after waking to ensure proper mobility.

To validate the knockdown, Neuro2A (N2A) cells treated with siRNA and F11 cells treated with shRNA were studied using qPCR analysis. N2A cells (ATCC catalog #CCL-131) were grown to 50% confluency (in EMEM, 10%FBS, 1% Pen/Strep) on 35 mm dishes and treated for 48h using different concentrations (5nM, 10nM or 20nM) of siRNA directed against mouse TACAN (QIAGEN FlexiTube siRNA, # SI01311919, name Mm_MGI:2686991_1) or 10 nM negative control siRNA (QIAGEN # 1027284). Total RNA was extracted using Promega Relia Prep RNA cell system (#Z6011) and converted to cDNA using Thermo-Fisher Scientific Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (catalog #K1641). For each sample, qPCR reactions were performed in quadruplicates on an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus Real Time qPCR System using QIAGEN QuantiNova Probe PCR Kit (QIAGEN #208254) and Taqman Gene expression primer probe mix for mouse TACAN (Thermo-Fisher Scientific Gene Expression Assay number Mm00659987_m1). TACAN gene expression levels were quantified by the double delta Ct analysis using Beta actin (Mm00607939_s1) as a housekeeping reference gene. Results are expressed as means of three independent experiments.
F11 cells (ECACC #08062601) were grown in DMEM + 2mM Glutamine, +2% FBS, +1% Pen/Strep. Cells (passages 15 to 22) were plated in 35 mm dishes at 25% confluency in 1mL of culture medium. Two microliters of viral solution were added the day after plating. Total RNA was extracted 72h after infection when cells had reached about 90% confluency. Three independent experiments were conducted, each experiment consisting of 3 dishes per condition. Expression levels of TACAN were determined by qPCR in quadruplicates as described above.
Animals were placed on a wire-mesh platform in clear plastic cylinders and were allowed to settle for 45 min. Testing was carried out with von Frey filaments of increasing stiffness (from 0.04 to 4g) applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw. One trial consisted of 5 applications of the filament within a one-minute period. The examiner was blind to the animals’ genotype or AAV injection during the experiment. Behavioral responses were scored as previously described ( Ducourneau et al., 2014 18. Ducourneau, V.R. ∙ Dolique, T. ∙ Hachem-Delaunay, S. ... Cancer pain is not necessarily correlated with spinal overexpression of reactive glia markers Pain. 2014; 155 :275-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), but adapted to mice. Briefly, the mouse reaction to the von Frey application was scored as follows: 0 = no response; 1 = detection (mouse would move its toes or contract its leg muscles without any movement); 2 = withdrawal reaction; 3 = escape (mouse withdraws and avoids further contact with the stimulus by moving its body away from the filament or by guarding its paw); 4 = licking/biting of the stimulated paw after withdrawal. Scores with values higher than 2 were classified as nocifensive reactions. To determine the proportions of responses as below threshold ( Figure 6 ), scores with values of 0 or 1 were pooled together in the “below threshold” group. Scores with values of 2 were used in the “withdrawal reflex” group, and values of 3 and 4 were pooled together in the “nocifensive response” group.
Mice were placed on a glass surface in clear plastic cylinders and were allowed to settle for 45min. Radiant heat was delivered from below the glass plate by a heat source (IITC) focused on the hindpaw. The latency to paw withdrawal was measured and averaged for each trial that consisted of 5 stimulations taken at 5 to 10 min intervals. To avoid tissue damage, a cut-off latency was defined at 30 s ( Hargreaves et al., 1988 24. Hargreaves, K. ∙ Dubner, R. ∙ Brown, F. ... A new and sensitive method for measuring thermal nociception in cutaneous hyperalgesia Pain. 1988; 32 :77-88 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4561) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Animals were placed on a wire-mesh platform in clear plastic cylinders and were allowed to settle for 45 min. Pinprick was assessed using a blunted 25G needle gently applied to the plantar surface of the hindpaw five times, without penetration of the skin. The average number of withdrawals induced by the five applications was calculated.
Analysis of mechanically-evoked current in cell-attached and outside-out recordings was performed using ClampFit. Traces were baseline-subtracted before setting cursors at the onset and offset of the pressure steps. Statistics were run on the region bounded by these cursors, where we extracted the average current. Some representative traces (when indicated) were also low-pass filtered at 1kHz to better display single-channel openings, and as such, show a smaller background noise level. Mean open time for outside-out recordings was measured on every opening validated by our selection protocol.
Statistical analysis was performed in MATLAB and Excel. Statistical details can be found in the figure legends and in the main text. Reported n values can be found in the figure legends and in the results.
This study did not generate any unique datasets or code.
