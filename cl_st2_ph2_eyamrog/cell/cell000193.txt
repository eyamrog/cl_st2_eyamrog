Title: Patrolling Alveolar Macrophages Conceal Bacteria from the Immune System to Maintain Homeostasis


Abstract: Summary

During respiration, humans breathe in more than 10,000 liters of non-sterile air daily, allowing some pathogens access to alveoli. Interestingly, alveoli outnumber alveolar macrophages (AMs), which favors alveoli devoid of AMs. If AMs, like most tissue macrophages, are sessile, then this numerical advantage would be exploited by pathogens unless neutrophils from the blood stream intervened. However, this would translate to omnipresent persistent inflammation. Developing in vivo real-time intravital imaging of alveoli revealed AMs crawling in and between alveoli using the pores of Kohn. Importantly, these macrophages sensed, chemotaxed, and, with high efficiency, phagocytosed inhaled bacterial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus , cloaking the bacteria from neutrophils. Impairing AM chemotaxis toward bacteria induced superfluous neutrophil recruitment, leading to inappropriate inflammation and injury. In a disease context, influenza A virus infection impaired AM crawling via the type II interferon signaling pathway, and this greatly increased secondary bacterial co-infection.

Section: Introduction

Thousands of liters of non-sterile air pass through the pulmonary system every day, but the lungs are, for the most part, maintained inflammation and pathogen free. Although it has been suggested that inhaled bacteria are mostly filtered through the upper respiratory tract and the conducting airways, aerosolized pathogens can be detected in alveoli ( Cohen et al., 2018 13. Cohen, S.B. ∙ Gern, B.H. ∙ Delahaye, J.L. ... Alveolar Macrophages Provide an Early Mycobacterium tuberculosis Niche and Initiate Dissemination Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :439-446.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ). The immune response to this basal degree of pathogen invasion at the alveolar level of the lungs remains poorly characterized. To date, we have relied on experimental models of infection, where a large inoculum or a highly virulent strain of a bacterial pathogen is administered into the lungs to study the immune response at this site. This results in a potent inflammatory response characterized by epithelial cells and resident macrophages recruiting neutrophils that phagocytose and help eradicate the inhaled pathogen, after which the lungs return to a homeostatic state ( Robb et al., 2016 55. Robb, C.T. ∙ Regan, K.H. ∙ Dorward, D.A. ... Key mechanisms governing resolution of lung inflammation Semin. Immunopathol. 2016; 38 :425-448 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). This robust inflammatory response causes bystander tissue injury, epithelial cell damage, and increased vascular leakage, all of which can induce pulmonary dysfunction and even death ( Grommes and Soehnlein, 2011 23. Grommes, J. ∙ Soehnlein, O. Contribution of neutrophils to acute lung injury Mol. Med. 2011; 17 :293-307 Crossref Scopus (1045) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of course, this type of inflammatory response to each breath of non-sterile air would not be conducive to life, raising questions about how bacteria that invade the alveolar spaces are cleared without continuous neutrophil infiltration and ongoing inflammation.
During homeostasis, alveolar macrophages (AMs), are the predominant immune cells present in the alveoli of humans ( Silver et al., 2016 61. Silver, R.F. ∙ Myers, A.J. ∙ Jarvela, J. ...

Leukocyte compartments in the mouse lung: distinguishing between marginated, interstitial, and alveolar cells in response to injury J. Immunol. Methods. 2012; 375 :100-110 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), with essentially no inflammatory cells such as neutrophils. These fetal liver monocyte-derived cells differentiate ( Guilliams et al., 2013 24. Guilliams, M. ∙ De Kleer, I. ∙ Henri, S. ...

Immunol. 2014; 15 :1026-1037 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ) into a long-lived and self-sustaining pool of macrophages that have been proposed to populate some but perhaps not all alveoli ( Bhattacharya and Westphalen, 2016 8. Bhattacharya, J. ∙ Westphalen, K. Macrophage-epithelial interactions in pulmonary alveoli Semin. Immunopathol. 2016; 38 :461-469 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westphalen et al., 2014 73. Westphalen, K. ∙ Gusarova, G.A. ∙ Islam, M.N. ... Sessile alveolar macrophages communicate with alveolar epithelium to modulate immunity Nature. 2014; 506 :503-506 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). AMs, like all other tissue macrophages, have been predicted to maintain homeostasis by removing endogenous proteins (e.g., surfactants and cellular debris) and resolving inflammation by removing dead cells ( Hussell and Bell, 2014 32. Hussell, T. ∙ Bell, T.J. Alveolar macrophages: plasticity in a tissue-specific context Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :81-93 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roberts et al., 2017 56.

Tissue-Resident Macrophages Are Locally Programmed for Silent Clearance of Apoptotic Cells Immunity. 2017; 47 :913-927.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some functional studies, however, have suggested that these same cells seem to operate as sentinels, becoming very pro-inflammatory, recruiting neutrophils and other inflammatory immune cells, albeit to high pathogen inoculum ( Beck-Schimmer et al., 2005 6. Beck-Schimmer, B. ∙ Schwendener, R. ∙ Pasch, T. ... Alveolar macrophages regulate neutrophil recruitment in endotoxin-induced lung injury Respir. Res. 2005; 6 :61 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yao et al., 2018 75. Yao, Y. ∙ Jeyanathan, M. ∙ Haddadi, S. ... Induction of Autonomous Memory Alveolar Macrophages Requires T Cell Help and Is Critical to Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 175 :1634-1650.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another common characteristic of tissue macrophages is their lack of motility within tissues ( Mowat et al., 2017 47. Mowat, A.M. ∙ Scott, C.L. ∙ Bain, C.C. Barrier-tissue macrophages: functional adaptation to environmental challenges Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1258-1270 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, visualization of AMs in lung explants suggests that these cells are immobilized within the alveoli ( Westphalen et al., 2014 73. Westphalen, K. ∙ Gusarova, G.A. ∙ Islam, M.N. ... Sessile alveolar macrophages communicate with alveolar epithelium to modulate immunity Nature. 2014; 506 :503-506 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises a conundrum because, if there is only 1 AM for every 3 alveoli, and if, upon inhalation, a bacterium adhered in an alveolus devoid of AMs, then the pathogen would be able to proliferate ( Hook et al., 2018 30. Hook, J.L. ∙ Islam, M.N. ∙ Parker, D. ... Disruption of staphylococcal aggregation protects against lethal lung injury J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :1074-1086 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) without immediate immune resistance. This would require that recruited inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, constantly infiltrate the alveolar spaces, resulting in continuous inflammation. Alternatively, it is also possible that, in an in vivo environment, AMs are more dynamic than currently suggested. Without being able to visualize these cells in vivo , their behavior and the mechanisms by which millions of alveoli are maintained free of pathogens and inflammation remain somewhat enigmatic.
Imaging AMs in their natural environment has been extremely difficult. Diffraction of light (from air to tissue to air-filled alveoli), the lack of specific reporter molecules and the gross movement of the lungs are deterrents to obtaining quantifiable images. Imaging explanted lungs has resulted in numerous interesting observations ( Thornton et al., 2012 70. Thornton, E.E. ∙ Looney, M.R. ∙ Bose, O. ... Spatiotemporally separated antigen uptake by alveolar dendritic cells and airway presentation to T cells in the lung J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :1183-1199 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Torabi-Parizi et al., 2014 71. Torabi-Parizi, P. ∙ Vrisekoop, N. ∙ Kastenmuller, W. ...

Immunol. 2014; 192 :1651-1660 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westphalen et al., 2014 73. Westphalen, K. ∙ Gusarova, G.A. ∙ Islam, M.N. ... Sessile alveolar macrophages communicate with alveolar epithelium to modulate immunity Nature. 2014; 506 :503-506 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ) but lacks the vascular neutrophil component, and more importantly, the behavior of immune cells ex vivo can be vastly different than in vivo ( Mempel et al., 2004 44. Mempel, T.R. ∙ Henrickson, S.E. ∙ Von Andrian, U.H. T-cell priming by dendritic cells in lymph nodes occurs in three distinct phases Nature. 2004; 427 :154-159 Crossref Scopus (1410) PubMed Google Scholar ; Germain et al., 2006 19. Germain, R.N. ∙ Miller, M.J. ∙ Dustin, M.L. ... Dynamic imaging of the immune system: progress, pitfalls and promise Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6 :497-507 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, to better understand how AMs maintain alveolar homeostasis during the steady state and during inhalation of pathogens, we developed a novel way of imaging these macrophages in their natural environment with normal blood flow and ventilation and unveil that these cells constantly patrol multiple alveoli squeezing through channels (pores of Kohn) for very efficient bacterial clearance independent of neutrophil recruitment. When the chemotactic/crawling machinery in AMs was inhibited chemically, genetically, or via pathogenic flu, there was less efficient capture of pathogens, and neutrophils were rapidly recruited to help eliminate bacteria, leading to unnecessary inflammation.

Section: Results

We assessed the immune cell composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), representing the airspace compartment, in naive mice. The alveolar compartment was replete with AMs. Other immune cells, such as dentritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes, were found at a frequency of less than 2%. Inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils or eosinophils, were virtually absent ( Figure S1 A). Indeed, similar findings have also been noted in higher mammals, including macaques and humans ( Silver et al., 2016 61. Silver, R.F. ∙ Myers, A.J. ∙ Jarvela, J. ... Diversity of Human and Macaque Airway Immune Cells at Baseline and during Tuberculosis Infection Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2016; 55 :899-908 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2016 78. Yu, Y.-R.A. ∙ Hotten, D.F. ∙ Malakhau, Y. ... Flow Cytometric Analysis of Myeloid Cells in Human Blood, Bronchoalveolar Lavage, and Lung Tissues Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2016; 54 :13-24 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whole-mount sections of the lungs revealed that not every alveolus contained an AM ( Figure 1 A; Video S1 ), as reported previously ( Westphalen et al., 2014 73. Westphalen, K. ∙ Gusarova, G.A. ∙ Islam, M.N. ... Sessile alveolar macrophages communicate with alveolar epithelium to modulate immunity Nature. 2014; 506 :503-506 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, quantification of the number of AMs within alveoli indicated that, surprisingly, as much as 60% of alveoli were unprotected (devoid of AMs) ( Figure 1 B).

Image reconstruction was done using Imaris software.
Next we developed a method to visualize these cells in vivo . AMs express high levels of CD11c and SiglecF; however, several other types of immune cells in the lungs, including DCs and eosinophils, also express these markers ( Misharin et al., 2013 46. Misharin, A.V. ∙ Morales-Nebreda, L. ∙ Mutlu, G.M. ... Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages and dendritic cell subsets in the mouse lung Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2013; 49 :503-510 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ), making use of these antibodies to label AMs for imaging in vivo non-specific. Instead, we labeled AMs by exploiting their critical function; i.e., constant phagocytosis ( Hussell and Bell, 2014 32. Hussell, T. ∙ Bell, T.J. Alveolar macrophages: plasticity in a tissue-specific context Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :81-93 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, PKH26 dye aggregates, administered directly into the lungs, were phagocytosed by AMs, allowing specific labeling ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Flow cytometric assessment (fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS]) of the BALF and the lungs confirmed that more than 97% of cells labeled with PKH26 were, in fact, AMs. The efficiency of labeling AMs was 90% ( Figure 1 C). These PKH26 + AMs (referred to hereafter as PKH-AMs) were side-scatter (SSC) hi , CD45 hi , autofluorescence + , CD11c + , CD11b − , SiglecF + , CD64 + , CD68 + , CD206 + , F4/80 lo , Ly6C − , Ly6G − (GR1 − ), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II lo/− , confirming their AM identity ( Figure S1 D). Furthermore, we validated that 100% of the PKH-AMs resided on the alveolar side of the lungs by co-administering fluorophore-conjugated anti-CD45 antibodies intravenously and intratracheally; only intratracheal administration labeled PKH-AMs ( Figure 1 D). 3D rendering of lung whole-mount sections confirmed that many alveoli were devoid of PKH-AMs ( Figure 1 E).
We were concerned that administration of dye into the lungs could induce inflammation or alter the function of AMs. However, PKH26 did not induce alveolar inflammation, as assessed by quantifying total numbers of neutrophils recruited into the alveoli. Less than 20 neutrophils could be seen in the entire BAL under these conditions, which was not different compared with saline-treated controls ( Figure S1 E). Moreover, we also assessed the turbidity of the BALF, which measures AM function of clearing alveolar fluid of protein, lipids, and cell debris ( Suzuki et al., 2014 66. Suzuki, T. ∙ Arumugam, P. ∙ Sakagami, T. ... Pulmonary macrophage transplantation therapy Nature. 2014; 514 :450-454 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not observe differences in BALF turbidity between control and PKH26-treated mice. Depleting AMs by administering chlodronate liposomes, on the other hand, led to a robust increase in turbidity ( Figure S1 F).
We combined our labeling approach with previously described intravital lung imaging ( Headley et al., 2016 26. Headley, M.B. ∙ Bins, A. ∙ Nip, A. ...

Baseline imaging corroborated previous observations that not all alveoli contained PKH-AMs. During baseline imaging sessions, we observed multiple AM behaviors. Some PKH-AMs pirouetted without net displacement but appeared to be sampling, probing with pseudopods, and perhaps phagocytosing endogenous debris ( Video S2 ). To our surprise, some PKH-AMs were observed to crawl long distances that would span numerous alveolus lengths ( Figure 1 F; Videos S2 and S3 ). This clearly contradicts the general view that AMs are immobile (evidence reviewed in Mowat et al., 2017 47. Mowat, A.M. ∙ Scott, C.L. ∙ Bain, C.C. Barrier-tissue macrophages: functional adaptation to environmental challenges Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1258-1270 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) and could explain how all alveoli are maintained at homeostatic and pathogen free conditions. Using a lower-magnification objective (10×) to acquire a larger field of view, we tracked individual PKH-AMs over 2 h of imaging and noted that about 40% of the cells displaced more than 30 μm ( Figure 1 G; Videos S3 and S4 ), with a few making very long tracks. Only 10% were completely stationary, but a significant amount moved less than 30 μm over 2 h, although not always in the same alveolus (discussed below). PKH-AMs had a median velocity of ∼0.8 μm/min ( Figure 1 H), which is much slower than, for example, neutrophils ( Yipp et al., 2017 76. Yipp, B.G. ∙ Kim, J.H. ∙ Lima, R. ... The lung is a host defense niche for immediate neutrophil-mediated vascular protection Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaam8929 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that they may be doing more than just crawling; i.e., cleaning the alveolar epithelial surface. This behavior seemed to lack directionality, and crawling appeared to be random ( Figure 1 I).

Track of PKH-AM in blue. scale bar is 20 μm.
Some PKH-AMs seemed to move short distances from one alveolus to another. Moreover, PKH-AMs that made long linear tracks must also have exited the alveolus in which they were initially ( Videos S3 and S4 ). It was unclear how the AMs could get from one alveolus to the next because they were never seen to enter the parenchyma or the pleural space to then enter a new alveolus (data not shown). We did observe some PKH-AMs squeezing into and out of what appeared to be tunnels between two alveoli ( Figure 1 J; Video S5 ). Indeed, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we could observe AMs in the process of moving through pore-like-structures between two alveoli ( Figure 1 K). These channels have been referred to previously as the pores of Kohn ( Cordingley, 1972 14. Cordingley, J.L. Pores of Kohn Thorax. 1972; 27 :433-441 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) and deemed to be critical for maintaining pressure equilibrium among alveoli. We would submit a novel role for pores of Kohn: to allow patrolling AMs passage from one alveolus to the next.

Yellow dots demarcate the alveolar boundary. scale bar is 10 μm.
AMs produce a high autofluorescent signal ( Misharin et al., 2013 46. Misharin, A.V. ∙ Morales-Nebreda, L. ∙ Mutlu, G.M. ... Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages and dendritic cell subsets in the mouse lung Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The crawling behavior of the autofluorescent AMs was nearly identical to that of PKH-AMs ( Video S6 ), again indicating that PKH26 did not induce any untoward alteration of AM behavior and function.

Crawling Behavior of Unlabeled AMs, Related to Figure 1 10X time lapse video of the lung of naive mice. Green: alveolar auto-fluorescence and auto-fluorescence of alveolar macrophages. Multi-colored tracks are shown for few of the auto-fluorescent AMs present in the FOV. Scale bar is 20 μm.
Using Immunological Genome Consortium (Immgen) microarray data, we noted several adhesion and migration molecules that were highly expressed on AMs, including β2-integrins: CD11a/LFA-1 ( Itgal ) and CD11c ( Itgax ) ( Figure 2 A; Figure S2 A). CD11a is an important adhesion molecule that is utilized by immune cells during crawling and migration ( Smith et al., 2007 62. Smith, A. ∙ Stanley, P. ∙ Jones, K. ... The role of the integrin LFA-1 in T-lymphocyte migration Immunol. Rev. 2007; 218 :135-146 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ); no known migratory function exists for CD11c. Therefore, we focused on CD11a, and, using FACS, we confirmed abundant protein expression of CD11a on the AM surface ( Figure 2 B). We tracked PKH-AM dynamics in WT (wild-type) mice and LFA-1 KO (knockout) mice ( Itgal −/− mice lacking CD11a). PKH-AMs from LFA-1 KO mice had a significant decrease in displacement compared with WT mice ( Figures 2 C and 2D). However, this did not affect the distribution of AMs throughout the lungs because no obvious clustering or large areas devoid of macrophages were noted ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Clearly, LFA-1 was not important in macrophages seeding the alveolar compartment at birth, consistent with lack of a role of integrins in recruitment of immune cells from the vasculature into the lung parenchyma ( Andonegui et al., 2003 2. Andonegui, G. ∙ Bonder, C.S. ∙ Green, F. ... Endothelium-derived Toll-like receptor-4 is the key molecule in LPS-induced neutrophil sequestration into lungs J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111 :1011-1020 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, it is possible that the global LFA-1 KO mouse had effects beyond AMs. Because, to our knowledge, an Itgal -floxed mouse has not been published, and a lineage-specific molecule just for AMs also does not exist, an AM-specific LFA-1 KO system was not available. Therefore, we delivered an LFA-1-blocking antibody acutely (3 h) directly into the lungs to test whether specifically blocking LFA-1 in AMs also resulted in impaired crawling. The antibodies do not readily cross the epithelial barrier (as noted with the CD45 antibody experiments) and, therefore, cannot affect circulating immune cells. AMs in anti-LFA-1-treated mice had a reduced capacity for displacement compared with isotype-treated mice ( Figure 2 H), clearly supporting the view that AMs utilize CD11a to crawl on the alveolar epithelium. Next we also tried to identify the ligand for LFA-1, and, despite the epithelium expressing high levels of ICAM-1 and some ICAM-2 ( Figures S2 D and S2E), a double KO (ICAM-1/2 DKO) failed to impair crawling ( Figure S2 F). LFA-1, however, has been described as a promiscuous molecule that can also bind JAMs, ESM-1, immobilized serum molecules, and even inert substances ( Béchard et al., 2001 5. Béchard, D. ∙ Scherpereel, A. ∙ Hammad, H. ... Human endothelial-cell specific molecule-1 binds directly to the integrin CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) and blocks binding to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 J. Immunol. 2001; 167 :3099-3106 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ostermann et al., 2002 48. Ostermann, G. ∙ Weber, K.S.C. ∙ Zernecke, A. ... JAM-1 is a ligand of the beta(2) integrin LFA-1 involved in transendothelial migration of leukocytes Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3 :151-158 Crossref Scopus (560) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Next we assessed whether the impairment in crawling of AMs in LFA-1 KO mice translated into a functional defect. We observed that LFA-1 KO mice had significantly higher BALF turbidity compared with the WT ( Figure 2 E). To further explore this, we measured dead cell/debris, protein, and cholesterol levels in the BALF. We noted a significant increase in CD45 − viability dye + and Annexin-V + debris (possibly epithelial cell remnants; Schneider et al., 2014b 60. Schneider, C. ∙ Nobs, S.P. ∙ Heer, A.K. ... Alveolar macrophages are essential for protection from respiratory failure and associated morbidity following influenza virus infection PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 :e1004053 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ) in LFA-1 KO mice ( Figure 2 F; Figures S2 G and S2H). Changes in total cholesterol levels in the BALF supernatant were also noted between LFA-1 KO mice and WT controls, whereas protein levels were not different ( Figures S2 I and S2J). These functional defects were not due to differences in AM numbers because the total numbers of AMs (in the lungs and BALF) were not different ( Figure 2 G; Figure S2 K). These results suggest that AM crawling via LFA-1 (not numbers of cells) is crucial for maintaining and clearing the alveolar spaces of endogenous cellular debris, whereas proteins are still cleared effectively even when AMs cannot crawl, presumably because of the flow of proteins within the alveoli. It is worth mentioning that hindering AM development leads to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, suggesting that immature macrophages ( Schneider et al., 2014a 59. Schneider, C. ∙ Nobs, S.P. ∙ Kurrer, M. ... Induction of the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ by the cytokine GM-CSF is critical for the differentiation of fetal monocytes into alveolar macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :1026-1037 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ), but not LFA-1 deficient AMs, lack the capacity to remove proteins.
We next wanted to find out how AMs respond to the presence of pathogens. To this end, we administered several doses (10 3 –10 6 ) of GFP expressing Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) directly into the lungs of anesthetized mice. Using FACS, P. aeruginosa could be detected in AMs ( P. aeruginosa + AMs) at doses between 10 4 –10 6 , albeit at very low numbers at the lower concentration and not at all at 10 3 ( Figure 3 A). Thus, we decided to use the dose of 10 6 CFUs for our experiments. At 30 min (data not shown) and even 2 h post infection (p.i.) ( Figure 3 B), AMs were the predominant immune cells that had captured inhaled P. aeruginosa , with only very few non-AM immune cells, including neutrophils, harboring bacteria at this concentration (10 6 colony-forming units [CFUs]) ( Figures 3 A and 3B). To confirm that P. aeruginosa was in AMs, a transparency map was created ( Figure 3 C), and as the transparency of PKH-AMs was increased (less green), P. aeruginosa came into view (red particles), consistent with bacteria being intracellular in AMs. Notably, when AMs were depleted with chlodronate liposomes ( Figure 3 D) and then P. aeruginosa was administered, a significant increase in the amount of total neutrophils ( Figure 3 E) and P. aeruginosa + neutrophils in the BALF was noted ( Figure 3 F). Moreover, in the absence of AMs, higher CFUs of “free” P. aeruginosa were also found in alveoli ( Figure 3 G). These observations highlight the importance of AMs as an extremely effective pathogen uptake mechanism that conceals inhaled pathogens from the rest of the immune system.
We next used IVM to visualize the interaction between PKH-AMs and inhaled P. aeruginosa . Logistically, it was only possible to pretreat mice with P. aeruginosa prior to preparing for IVM ( Figure 3 H). Surprisingly, it became clear that as quickly as we could mount the preparation on the microscope, ∼80% of P. aeruginosa was already associated with PKH-AMs ( Figure 3 I), suggesting an extremely effective pathogen sequestration mechanism. Importantly, using a higher concentration of bacteria (10 7 CFUs), free P. aeruginosa (still a rare event) could be observed. PKH-AMs in close proximity could be seen crawling toward the bacterium and phagocytosing it ( Figure 3 J; Video S7 ). To confirm that crawling was indeed important for pathogen capture, we administered P. aeruginosa directly into the lungs of WT and LFA-1 KO mice. This led to a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa + AMs in LFA-1 KO mice ( Figure 3 K).

Green: PKH-AM, Blue: neutrophils, Red: P. aeruginosa . Scale bar is 20 μm.
We next blocked the majority of chemoattractant-mediated signaling (blocked Gαi-coupled receptors) using pertussis toxin (PTx) administered into the lungs 3 days prior to experiments ( Figure 4 A). PTx can block Gαi signaling in AMs for up to 2 weeks ( Carbonetti et al., 2007 11. Carbonetti, N.H. ∙ Artamonova, G.V. ∙ Van Rooijen, N. ... Pertussis toxin targets airway macrophages to promote Bordetella pertussis infection of the respiratory tract Infect. Immun. 2007; 75 :1713-1720 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ) but did not have inflammatory side effects in the lungs, as assessed by measuring the number of neutrophils present in the BALF and whole-lung homogenates. PTx also did not affect AM behavior or numbers or other non-AM immune cells ( Figures S3 C–S3F and S3 P–S3R), suggesting that basal AM crawling occurred independent of PTx-dependent chemotaxis. Imaging revealed that, at 2 h p.i., inhibition of AM chemotaxis resulted in a significant increase in free P. aeruginosa in the alveolar spaces ( Figures 4 B and 4C). In fact, PKH-AMs adjacent to P. aeruginosa failed to detect and capture the bacteria during imaging sessions of up to 2 h ( Video S8 ). FACS of the lungs 2 h p.i. indicated that inhibiting AM chemotaxis led to a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa + AMs ( Figure 4 D), corroborating our IVM observations. Unlike bacteria, 2 h after treatment with inert sterile beads (at a similar dose of 10 6 beads), which does not attract AMs via chemotaxis, resulted in almost identical phagocytosis of beads ( Figure S3 G). Next, we tested whether this observation could also be extended to other inhaled pathogens. Therefore, we administered GFP-expressing Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus [ S. aureus ]) directly into the lungs of control or PTx pre-treated mice. This resulted in an outcome identical to P. aeruginosa ; i.e., there was a significant decrease in S. aureus + AMs in PTx pretreated mice ( Figure S3 H). Taken together, these results indicate that motility, and more specifically chemotaxis, toward pathogens is a requirement for AMs to capture optimal amounts of inhaled pathogens in alveoli.

Perturbing the Ability of AMs to Sense and Capture Inhaled Bacteria, Related to Figure 4 10X time lapse video (cropped and zoomed-in) of the lung of mice infected with P. aeruginosa 2 h prior to imaging. Mice were pre-treated with PTx (10ng) 3 days prior to infection. Green: PKH-AMs, Red: P. aeruginosa . Arrow pointing to free P. aeruginosa . Note that there are many AMs in close proximity to P. aeruginosa that are unable to sense it. Scale bar is 20 μm.
We assessed the transcripts of chemokine receptors in AMs and noted that AMs expressed very high levels of C5a receptor/CD88 ( C5ar1 ) and formylated peptide receptors ( Fpr1 and Fpr2 ) ( Figure 4 E; Figure S3 I). We first tested whether complement components were important in capture of inhaled bacteria by utilizing C3 KO mice ( C3 −/− mice lacking C3). Two hours p.i. with P. aeruginosa into the lungs of WT or C3 KO mice, we recovered 5-fold higher CFUs of P. aeruginosa in the BALF of C3 KO mice ( Figure 4 F). This suggested that there were many more free bacteria in the alveolar spaces of C3 KO compared with WT mice, perhaps because of a lack of chemotaxis. Interestingly, no differences in the amount P. aeruginosa + AMs were observed ( Figure 4 G), suggesting more growth of bacteria in the mutant mice. To further explore this, we removed the ability of bacteria to replicate by fixing P. aeruginosa and administered them directly into the lungs of WT or C3 KO mice. This resulted in a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa + AMs in C3 KO mice ( Figure 4 H). Moreover, using FACS, we were able to find higher numbers of free fixed GFP + P. aeruginosa in the BALF of C3 KO compared with WT mice, supporting the concept that complement fragments play a role in chemotaxis of AMs toward bacteria ( Figure 4 I). Next we tested whether these results were due to C5a-C5ar1-mediated chemotaxis. We administered a C5ar1-blocking antibody directly into the lungs of naive mice, followed by administration of live or fixed P. aeruginosa . Higher numbers of fixed P. aeruginosa or live bacteria were found in the BALF of anti-C5ar1-treated compared with isotype-treated mice ( Figure 4 J; Figure S3 J). However, P. aeruginosa + AMs were reduced only when fixed P. aeruginosa was administered ( Figure 4 K; Figure S3 K).
We also tested whether bacterial metabolites, such as formylated peptides, attract AMs by utilizing FPR-1 KO mice ( Fpr1 −/− mice lacking FPR-1). Interestingly, lack of only FPR-1 did not impair the ability of AMs to capture inhaled P. aeruginosa ( Figures S3 L and S3M). We set up an in vitro chemotaxis assay to validate these results. In in vitro chemotaxis assays, AM migration toward P. aeruginosa was partially impaired when C5ar1 was blocked and was intact with FPR-1 KO AMs ( Figure 4 L). However, when C5ar1 was additionally blocked in FPR-1 KO AMs, AM chemotaxis was further reduced to 25% of control levels ( Figure 4 L). Collectively, these results suggest that AMs utilize rapidly generated C5a and, to a lesser extent, bacterial metabolites, including formylated peptides. However, these experiments also highlight the tremendous redundancy in the system, so for further functional experiments, PTx was used to globally impair AM chemotaxis.
We noted that inhalation of 10 6 CFUs of P. aeruginosa crossed a threshold for neutrophil recruitment into the BALF ( Figure S3 A). Indeed, at 2 h p.i. with P. aeruginosa , 1,000–10,000 neutrophils were present in the BALF, which was not affected by blocking AM chemotaxis ability at this early time point ( Figure 5 A, first panel). It is worth noting that BALF neutrophils 2 h after P. aeruginosa made up only about 0.5% of the total neutrophils that could be found in whole-lung homogenates ( Figure S3 N). This suggested that most of the lung neutrophils were in the pulmonary vasculature, adherent to the endothelium. Interestingly, almost 20% of the neutrophils in BALF were P. aeruginosa + when AM chemotaxis was impaired, whereas less than 1% of neutrophils were P. aeruginosa + when the AMs were fully functional ( Figure 5 B, first panel). This is consistent with functional AMs scavenging many more P. aeruginosa , leaving very few available for neutrophils. Over the next 4 h, twice as many neutrophils were recruited into the BALF of PTx pretreated than control mice ( Figure 5 A, second panel), suggesting that free bacteria signal more neutrophils to infiltrate into alveoli, and higher numbers of neutrophils were P. aeruginosa + in BALF of PTx pretreated mice at 6 h p.i. ( Figure 5 B, second panel).
Next we performed a chemokine/cytokine array of the BALF supernatant and noted that impairing AM chemotaxis significantly enhanced production of the neutrophil-specific chemokines MIP-2 and KC ( Figure 5 C). Moreover, greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as cytokines that mobilize neutrophils from bone marrow, such as G-CSF and GM-CSF, were observed when AM chemotaxis was impaired ( Figure 5 C). We also noted increased leakage of proteins into the BALF ( Figure 5 D). FACS and histological examinations indicated heightened neutrophil infiltration and inflammation ( Figure 5 E; Figure S3 O). By 24 h and 5 days, P. aeruginosa was detected in more mice when AMs were pretreated with PTx, despite higher neutrophil numbers in the lungs ( Figures 5 E and 5F). These observations were similar to the results seen when AMs were depleted prior to infection ( Figures 3 E–3G). Taken together, these results suggest that, when AMs are not able to contain the inhaled P. aeruginosa , neutrophil responses are enhanced, which can lead to deleterious inflammation and injury of the lung and less efficient clearance of P. aeruginosa .
Based on our observation that alterations in AM crawling affected capture and eradication of bacterial infection and previous reports suggesting altered AM responses to inhaled bacterial pathogens during the flu ( Ghoneim et al., 2013 21.

Induction of Autonomous Memory Alveolar Macrophages Requires T Cell Help and Is Critical to Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 175 :1634-1650.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that the ability of AMs to crawl during flu infection is impaired, leading to increased free bacteria in contact with the epithelium and, thus, heightened inflammatory responses during co-infection. We infected mice with influenza A virus (flu) and, 12 days later, as the mice were recovering, assessed AM crawling using IVM ( Figure 6 A; Figure S4 A). PKH-AMs in flu-infected mice had a significant defect in their ability to crawl in the alveolar spaces ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Control and flu-infected mice were next infected with P. aeruginosa or S. aureus . We found fewer AMs from flu-infected mice caught inhaled P. aeruginosa and S. aureus ( Figures 6 D; Figure S4 B). Moreover, flu-infected mice had mounted markedly higher neutrophilic responses compared with controls ( Figures 6 E and 6F; Figures S4 C and S4D) and had higher numbers of free bacterial CFUs in the BALF ( Figure S4 E). These data suggest that inability of AMs to crawl and capture inhaled bacteria after flu virus infection favors increased numbers of free bacteria, leading to increased neutrophil responses.
Flu infection can cause dramatic changes to the immune landscape in the lungs ( Metzger and Sun, 2013 45. Metzger, D.W. ∙ Sun, K. Immune Dysfunction and Bacterial Co-Infections following Influenza J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :2047-2052 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rynda-Apple et al., 2015 58. Rynda-Apple, A. ∙ Robinson, K.M. ∙ Alcorn, J.F. Influenza and Bacterial Superinfection: Illuminating the Immunologic Mechanisms of Disease Infect. Immun. 2015; 83 :3764-3770 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). To better understand how AM behavior is modulated upon flu infection, we assessed global transcriptional changes in AMs ( Figure 6 G). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis highlighted over 900 genes that were upregulated in AMs after flu infection (“flu up genes”; Figure S4 F). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the flu up genes indicated that the AMs had become hyperactivated and taken on an “inflammatory” phenotype. Indeed, flu up genes were highly enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes, including cytokine production, inflammatory response, and myeloid leukocyte activation ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Additionally, expression of MHC class II, CD11b, and alphaE:beta7 (CD103), molecules which naive AMs do not express at high levels, increased after flu infection ( Figure 6 J; Figure S4 G), suggesting AM activation. These observations are in line with a previous report suggesting that there is a sustained (up to 4 weeks) transcriptional change in AMs after flu infection that results in AMs becoming more inflammatory during a secondary challenge ( Yao et al., 2018 75. Yao, Y. ∙ Jeyanathan, M. ∙ Haddadi, S. ... Induction of Autonomous Memory Alveolar Macrophages Requires T Cell Help and Is Critical to Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 175 :1634-1650.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Because the alveolar spaces, even during the recovery phase after flu infection, are filled with cellular debris and, thus, may affect AM crawling, which would confound our findings, we used a reductive approach to test whether inflammatory AMs were able to migrate toward pathogens. We sorted AMs from flu-infected or control mice and performed in vitro migration assays. Although control AMs migrated toward P. aeruginosa , AMs from flu-infected mice had a marked intrinsic defect in their ability to migrate ( Figure 6 K). Pathway analysis of the flu up genes highlighted the type II interferon signaling pathway (interferon γ [IFNγ]) as being prominent after flu infection ( Figure S4 H). Earlier reports have identified IFNγ as an important cytokine that modulates AM function after flu infection ( Sun and Metzger, 2008 64. Sun, K. ∙ Metzger, D.W. Inhibition of pulmonary antibacterial defense by interferon-γ during recovery from influenza infection Nat. Med. 2008; 14 :558-564 Crossref Scopus (488) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yao et al., 2018 75. Yao, Y. ∙ Jeyanathan, M. ∙ Haddadi, S. ... Induction of Autonomous Memory Alveolar Macrophages Requires T Cell Help and Is Critical to Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 175 :1634-1650.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, neutralizing IFNγ resulted in partial restoration of AM migration ability compared with isotype-treated controls ( Figure 6 L). Taken together, these results suggest that activated or inflammatory AMs have a defect in their ability to migrate because of excessive IFNγ signaling during flu infection, providing a novel molecular mechanism for the protective anti-IFNγ effects.

Section: Discussion

Evolution has driven optimal host responses to pathogen invasion, ensuring that mammals are not overtly susceptible to infection. Survival of a species is entirely predicated upon this rule. At first glance, there appear to be two observations regarding the lungs that contradict this view if indeed the lungs are continuously exposed to non-sterile air. The first is a significant numerical disadvantage; 60% of alveolar spaces are devoid of AMs. The second is the sessile nature of AMs, meaning that some alveoli would remain unprotected throughout life. Because the process of respiration continuously exposes the lungs to the outside environment, pathogens would almost certainly exploit this situation. This would require that recruited immune cells constantly infiltrate the air spaces to combat the intruders. However, this is contradicted by the fact that the immune cell composition of the alveolar compartment is entirely made up of AMs in healthy mice and primates, including humans ( Misharin et al., 2013 46. Misharin, A.V. ∙ Morales-Nebreda, L. ∙ Mutlu, G.M. ... Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages and dendritic cell subsets in the mouse lung Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Biol. 2016; 54 :13-24 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), and neutrophil recruitment only occurs following invasive infection. Moreover, continuous neutrophil influx into alveolar space, as observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis (CF), leads to devastating lung injury and fibrosis, which does not happen (with every breath) in healthy individuals ( Gernez et al., 2010 20. Gernez, Y. ∙ Tirouvanziam, R. ∙ Chanez, P. Neutrophils in chronic inflammatory airway diseases: can we target them and how? Eur. Respir. J. 2010; 35 :467-469 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). An alternative possibility could be that the sessile population of macrophages in the alveoli potentially relies on liquid flow for bacterial capture; however, inhaled bacteria aggregate and become adherent to the alveolar epithelium, which would evade AMs ( Hook et al., 2018 30. Hook, J.L. ∙ Islam, M.N. ∙ Parker, D. ... Disruption of staphylococcal aggregation protects against lethal lung injury J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :1074-1086 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Using IVM to visualize the in vivo alveolar environment, we observed that only 30%–40% of alveoli contained AMs; however these macrophages, unlike other tissue macrophages we have imaged ( Deniset et al., 2017 16.

This behavioral difference compared with other macrophages is certainly in line with the local environment dictating activation of different transcription factors, which leads to distinct macrophage phenotypes ( Guilliams et al., 2020 25. Guilliams, M. ∙ Thierry, G.R. ∙ Bonnardel, J. ... Establishment and Maintenance of the Macrophage Niche Immunity. 2020; 52 :434-451 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our in vivo preparation, we noted that a small percentage of AMs (10%) were completely immobile, which could be the sessile population of AMs that communicated via epithelial gap junctions, as described previously ( Westphalen et al., 2014 73. Westphalen, K. ∙ Gusarova, G.A. ∙ Islam, M.N. ... Sessile alveolar macrophages communicate with alveolar epithelium to modulate immunity Nature. 2014; 506 :503-506 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the majority of cells often crawled between alveoli via the pores of Kohn. This would allow an AM to migrate a few microns but still critically move from one alveolus to the next. This is in line with previous speculations regarding the role of pores of Kohn ( Peão et al., 1993 52. Peão, M.N. ∙ Aguas, A.P. ∙ de Sá, C.M. ... Morphological evidence for migration of particle-laden macrophages through the interalveolar pores of Kohn in the murine lung Acta Anat. (Basel). 1993; 147 :227-232 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), where electron micrographs revealed immune cells stuck in these channels. Thus, in addition to being utilized as air passages that help prevent local alveolar collapse, AMs utilize pores of Kohn to patrol multiple alveolar spaces and facilitate AMs to chemotax and rapidly scavenge inhaled bacteria by entering alveoli lacking AMs.
Using RNA-seq and Immgen microarray data, complement 5a receptor ( C5ar1 ) and formylated peptide receptors ( Fpr1 ) were identified as being highly expressed in AMs, whereas Fpr2 was only detected in RNA-seq and is usually equated with non-chemotactic responses ( Dufton et al., 2010 18. Dufton, N. ∙ Hannon, R. ∙ Brancaleone, V. ... Anti-inflammatory role of the murine formyl-peptide receptor 2: ligand-specific effects on leukocyte responses and experimental inflammation J. Immunol. 2010; 184 :2611-2619 Crossref Scopus (260) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, although AMs utilized C5ar1 and FPR-1 to chemotax toward inhaled bacteria, C5ar1 was the dominant receptor, with FPR-1 providing an additional but somewhat redundant signal. The role of the C5a-C5ar1 axis was crucial; “missing” the opportunity to quickly sequester bacteria after they ended up in the alveoli (in C3 KO or anti-C5ar1-treated mice) allowed bacterial proliferation and neutrophil recruitment. This suggests a beneficial role of complement activation in the lungs during infection, contrary to what is observed in various lung diseases ( Pandya and Wilkes, 2014 49. Pandya, P.H. ∙ Wilkes, D.S. Complement system in lung disease Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2014; 51 :467-473 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, this is in line with earlier studies using C3 −/− or C5ar1 −/− mice, which have noted a marked survival defect upon pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection despite the presence of a high neutrophil response ( Höpken et al., 1996 31. Höpken, U.E. ∙ Lu, B. ∙ Gerard, N.P. ... The C5a chemoattractant receptor mediates mucosal defence to infection Nature. 1996; 383 :86-89 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Younger et al., 2003 77. Younger, J.G. ∙ Shankar-Sinha, S. ∙ Mickiewicz, M. ... Murine complement interactions with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and their consequences during pneumonia Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29 :432-438 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is worth noting that we and others have reported previously that the ligands for these two receptors, called end-target chemoattractants, are made at the source of the bacterial nidus and dominate as chemoattractants over chemokines in migrating neutrophils, over-riding any distraction non-end-target intermediary chemokines could potentially generate ( Heit et al., 2002 27. Heit, B. ∙ Tavener, S. ∙ Raharjo, E. ... An intracellular signaling hierarchy determines direction of migration in opposing chemotactic gradients J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159 :91-102 Crossref Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ). This seems to also be the case in AMs, and therefore we propose a model where AMs respond rapidly to end-target chemoattractants produced directly at the site of bacteria and rapidly eradicate the infection. When there is a delay in this process or the bacterial load is too high to eradicate rapidly, neutrophils are recruited to join the battle as a last resort.
We noted that, with an inoculum equivalent to or lower than 10 6 , AMs functioned as an immune barrier that prevented unnecessary recruitment of neutrophils into the alveolar spaces. When low doses of bacteria were administered into the lungs, AMs rapidly captured them and prevented neutrophil recruitment. Importantly, when this function was weakened by (1) AM removal, (2) impairment of AM motility, or (3) impairment of chemotaxis, less efficient bacterial clearance, higher neutrophil recruitment, and increased overall inflammation occurred at this site. Interestingly, neutrophils were not as efficient as AMs in eradicating P. aeruginosa . P. aeruginosa express Psl exopolysaccharide and a type III secretion system, which is used to impair neutrophil phagocytic machinery ( Thanabalasuriar et al., 2017 69. Thanabalasuriar, A. ∙ Surewaard, B.G.J. ∙ Willson, M.E. ... Bispecific antibody targets multiple Pseudomonas aeruginosa evasion mechanisms in the lung vasculature J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 :2249-2261 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, S. aureus grows in clumps and also releases toxins subverting classical neutrophil effector mechanisms, setting up neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release and inappropriate or excessive inflammation and bystander tissue injury ( Kolaczkowska et al., 2015 36. Kolaczkowska, E. ∙ Jenne, C.N. ∙ Surewaard, B.G.J. ... Molecular mechanisms of NET formation and degradation revealed by intravital imaging in the liver vasculature Nat.

Spaan, A.N. ∙ Surewaard, B.G.J. ∙ Nijland, R. ... Neutrophils versus Staphylococcus aureus: a biological tug of war Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 67 :629-650 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, perhaps because of their rapid arrival because of proximity, AMs efficiently eliminate limited amounts of pathogens before neutrophils can be alerted, causing a “silenced” immune response. Normal air has been estimated to contain up to 10 5 m −3 bacterial particles ( Prussin et al., 2015 54. Prussin, 2nd, A.J. ∙ Garcia, E.B. ∙ Marr, L.C. Total Virus and Bacteria Concentrations in Indoor and Outdoor Air Environ. Sci. Technol. Lett. 2015; 2 :84-88 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), and robust mechanisms (nasal hairs, mucous layer, ciliary escalator, and anti-microbial peptides) likely reduce the number of bacteria that gain access to alveoli. Indeed, we found that approximately an order of magnitude fewer bacteria managed to get from the upper respiratory tract to the alveoli ( Figure S3 B), and, interestingly, in our hands, the threshold for neutrophil recruitment occurred between 10 5 –10 6 bacteria introduced into the upper respiratory tract.
This raises the intriguing question of how bacteria could ever infect mammals with functional AMs. One of the most common ways is through co-infection. Indeed, the flu is one of the most common respiratory infections worldwide ( Taubenberger and Morens, 2008 67. Taubenberger, J.K. ∙ Morens, D.M. The pathology of influenza virus infections Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3 :499-522 Crossref Scopus (839) PubMed Google Scholar ), with over 0.3–0.6 million deaths every year ( Iuliano et al., 2018 33. Iuliano, A.D. ∙ Roguski, K.M. ∙ Chang, H.H. ..., Global Seasonal Influenza-associated Mortality Collaborator Network Estimates of global seasonal influenza-associated respiratory mortality: a modelling study Lancet. 2018; 391 :1285-1300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1853) PubMed Google Scholar ). Co-infections (secondary infection with bacterial pathogens) during flu are highly correlated with increased risk of mortality ( Rynda-Apple et al., 2015 58. Rynda-Apple, A. ∙ Robinson, K.M. ∙ Alcorn, J.F. Influenza and Bacterial Superinfection: Illuminating the Immunologic Mechanisms of Disease Infect. Immun. 2015; 83 :3764-3770 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, AMs are crucial in protecting against respiratory failure during flu in different animal models ( Kim et al., 2008 34. Kim, H.M. ∙ Lee, Y.-W. ∙ Lee, K.-J. ... Alveolar macrophages are indispensable for controlling influenza viruses in lungs of pigs J. Virol. 2008; 82 :4265-4274 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar , 2013 35.

Schneider, C. ∙ Nobs, S.P. ∙ Heer, A.K. ... Alveolar macrophages are essential for protection from respiratory failure and associated morbidity following influenza virus infection PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 :e1004053 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, flu infection also seems to alter AMs’ ability to respond to bacterial pathogens, and the subsequent over-exuberant inflammatory response can lead to mortality ( Ghoneim et al., 2013 21. Ghoneim, H.E. ∙ Thomas, P.G. ∙ McCullers, J.A. Depletion of alveolar macrophages during influenza infection facilitates bacterial superinfections J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :1250-1259 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ; Goulding et al., 2011 22. Goulding, J. ∙ Godlee, A. ∙ Vekaria, S. ... Lowering the threshold of lung innate immune cell activation alters susceptibility to secondary bacterial superinfection J. Infect. Dis. 2011; 204 :1086-1094 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sun and Metzger, 2008 64. Sun, K. ∙ Metzger, D.W. Inhibition of pulmonary antibacterial defense by interferon-γ during recovery from influenza infection Nat. Med. 2008; 14 :558-564 Crossref Scopus (488) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results are completely in line with these studies. We show that, upon flu infection, AMs are activated toward an inflammatory phenotype at the expense of effective migration within the alveoli, which facilitates opportunistic infection to take hold. Although some investigators have reported that AM numbers are decreased with the flu, this may only be restricted to the BALB/c strain of mice ( Califano et al., 2018a 9. Califano, D. ∙ Furuya, Y. ∙ Metzger, D.W. Effects of Influenza on Alveolar Macrophage Viability Are Dependent on Mouse Genetic Strain J. Immunol. 2018; 201 :134-144 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas our own results in C57BL/6 mice suggest that, rather than simply a loss of AMs, it is their impaired ability to patrol the alveoli and migrate toward inhaled bacteria that causes the increased bacterial infection rate. However, in both strains of mice, IFNγ seemed to be key for AM barrier impairment and successful secondary bacterial infection. Previous work ( Sun and Metzger, 2008 64. Sun, K. ∙ Metzger, D.W. Inhibition of pulmonary antibacterial defense by interferon-γ during recovery from influenza infection Nat. Med. 2008; 14 :558-564 Crossref Scopus (488) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yao et al., 2018 75. Yao, Y. ∙ Jeyanathan, M. ∙ Haddadi, S. ... Induction of Autonomous Memory Alveolar Macrophages Requires T Cell Help and Is Critical to Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 175 :1634-1650.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ) has suggested that increased levels of IFNs cause marked internal changes of AMs during flu infection, leading to secondary infections.
We and others found that some cytokines or Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) can interrupt migration, functioning as “stop” signals by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ( Heit et al., 2002 27. Heit, B. ∙ Tavener, S. ∙ Raharjo, E. ... An intracellular signaling hierarchy determines direction of migration in opposing chemotactic gradients J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159 :91-102 Crossref Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lokuta and Huttenlocher, 2005 40. Lokuta, M.A. ∙ Huttenlocher, A. TNF-alpha promotes a stop signal that inhibits neutrophil polarization and migration via a p38 MAPK pathway J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 78 :210-219 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the flu dramatically upregulated IFNγ, which also activates p38 MAP kinase ( Matsuzawa et al., 2012 43. Matsuzawa, T. ∙ Kim, B.-H. ∙ Shenoy, A.R. ... IFN-γ elicits macrophage autophagy via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway J. Immunol. 2012; 189 :813-818 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ), perhaps also inducing a stop signal in AMs. Indeed, blocking IFNγ in our experiments undid the paralysis and freed the AMs to resume their migratory behavior and clear secondary infections. In addition, upregulation of various integrins, including alphaE:beta7 (CD103), a tissue retention signal in mucosal tissues, may immobilize AMs in alveoli. A recent study suggested that increased SIRPα expression coupled with epigenetic modifications leads to up to 6 months of immune paralysis where AMs phagocytosis was impaired, suggesting multiple defects in AMs upon flu infection ( Roquilly et al., 2020 57. Roquilly, A. ∙ Jacqueline, C. ∙ Davieau, M. ... Alveolar macrophages are epigenetically altered after inflammation, leading to long-term lung immunoparalysis Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :636-648 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we only examined the flu in this study, we hypothesize that any disease where AMs are impaired or their numbers are reduced leads to increased infection susceptibility. Indeed, with silicosis and cigarette smoking, AM numbers have been reported to be decreased, and this leads to increased infection rates ( Berg et al., 2016 7. Berg, R.D. ∙ Levitte, S. ∙ O’Sullivan, M.P. ... Lysosomal Disorders Drive Susceptibility to Tuberculosis by Compromising Macrophage Migration Cell. 2016; 165 :139-152 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hodge et al., 2011 29. Hodge, S. ∙ Matthews, G. ∙ Mukaro, V. ... Cigarette smoke-induced changes to alveolar macrophage phenotype and function are improved by treatment with procysteine Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 44 :673-681 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pasula et al., 2009 50. Pasula, R. ∙ Britigan, B.E. ∙ Turner, J. ... Airway delivery of silica increases susceptibility to mycobacterial infection in mice: potential role of repopulating macrophages J. Immunol. 2009; 182 :7102-7109 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, one could envisage that, in CF, where altered mucus production could make migration of AMs more difficult, normal levels of inhaled bacteria could lead to ongoing neutrophil recruitment, continuously leading to the chronic inflammatory sequelae seen in this disease.
The most intriguing question is what evolutionary pressures favor the disproportionate AM-to-alveoli numbers. One might imagine that having an AM in every alveolus would be optimal. However, it is possible that a disproportion allows for just enough migratory AMs to conceal small amounts of bacteria under homeostasis but does not “hide” a real threat that would require recruitment of neutrophils. Whatever the rationale for this, it can only work efficiently when AMs are capable of movement and, when necessary, chemotactic motility. Therefore, AMs play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis by capturing and concealing inhaled bacteria while ensuring that the pulmonary system remains uninfected and uninflamed. A notion of “cloaking” has also been proposed recently for sterile injury, where macrophages sequestered necrotic debris to reduce neutrophil activation ( Uderhardt et al., 2019 72. Uderhardt, S. ∙ Martins, A.J. ∙ Tsang, J.S. ... Resident Macrophages Cloak Tissue Microlesions to Prevent Neutrophil-Driven Inflammatory Damage Cell. 2019; 177 :541-555.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). We postulate that, when AMs are impaired in their ability to cloak or conceal, the contact between bacteria and the alveolar epithelium, which expresses many pathogen recognition receptors, reaches a critical duration that then leads to release of chemokines and neutrophil recruitment ( Whitsett and Alenghat, 2015 74. Whitsett, J.A. ∙ Alenghat, T. Respiratory epithelial cells orchestrate pulmonary innate immunity Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16 :27-35 Crossref Scopus (524) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Lung ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 support spontaneous intravascular effector lymphocyte entrapment but are not required for neutrophil entrapment or emigration inside endotoxin-inflamed lungs FASEB J. 2016; 30 :1767-1778 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) were a kind gift from Dr. Ronen Alon. All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free, double-barrier unit at the University of Calgary. Mice were fed autoclaved rodent feed and water ad libitum . Mice were age and gender matched for experiments. All protocols used were in accordance with the guidelines drafted by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee and the Canadian Council on the Use of Laboratory Animals.
PKH26 phagocytic cell labeling kit (Sigma) was prepared according to manufacturer’s recommendation. Briefly, 100μM stock of PKH26 was prepared. The stock was then used to prepare 0.5μM or 5μM PKH26 in Diluent B. For flow cytometric experiments, we used 5μM in order to overcome the auto-fluorescent signal from AMs. For all IVM experiments 0.5μM PKH26 was used. Mice were administered 75uL of the reagents directly into the lung at least 5 days prior to imaging via oropharyngeal method (below).
Anesthetized mice were given fluorescently labeled antibodies i.v. via the jugular vein or tail vein prior to imaging. Neutrophils were identified with 4μg of anti-Ly6G, clone 1A8 (Biolegend) and 4μg of anti-GR1 (BD bioscience); the vasculature was identified with 4μg of labeled anti-CD31 (PECAM-1, ThermoFisher Scientific).
The method is adapted as a slight modification to a previously published procedure ( Lakatos et al., 2006 38. Lakatos, H.F. ∙ Burgess, H.A. ∙ Thatcher, T.H. ... Oropharyngeal aspiration of a silica suspension produces a superior model of silicosis in the mouse when compared to intratracheal instillation Exp. Lung Res. 2006; 32 :181-199 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized under 3% isoflurane (with oxygen as carrier), for 2-3 minutes. Immediately after, mice were suspended by their incisors in a 60° plane. The tongue was gently extruded using cotton-tip applicators and required volume was pipetted into the back of the throat. Then, the nares were gently closed using gloved finger until the mice took 10 deep breathes. The mice were returned to their cage and monitored until ambulatory.
GFP expressing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain 6206) and Staphylococcus aureus (strain MW2) were grown on blood agar plates overnight at 37°C. Multiple single colonies were picked from plates washed 2 times in sterile 1X PBS and OD600 was recorded. For FACS and CFU experiments approximately 3 × 10 6 CFU ( P. aeruginosa ) and 4 × 10 6 CFU ( S. aureus ) was administered directly into the lung via oropharyngeal method. In some IVM experiments 2-6x10 7 CFU ( P. aeruginosa ) was administered via oropharyngeal method to increase the chance of visualizing AM: bacteria interactions. For in vitro chemotaxis assay, P. aeruginosa from overnight plate cultures were sub-cultured for 3 hours, washed 2 times with sterile 1X PBS and OD600 was recorded. For some experiments, P. aeruginosa (with known concentration) was fixed using 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes in dark, washed 3 times with sterile 1X PBS, and resuspended in 1X PBS. We confirmed that that GFP signal was intact by assessing fixed bacteria under fluorescent microscope. An approximate dose of 3 × 10 6 fixed bacteria was used for such experiments.
Influenza A virus (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1; PR8) grown in 10-day embryonated hen’s eggs by standard procedures and titrated on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells as described elsewhere ( Anders et al., 1994 1. Anders, E.M. ∙ Hartley, C.A. ∙ Reading, P.C. ... Complement-dependent neutralization of influenza virus by a serum mannose-binding lectin J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75 :615-622 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under isoflurane anesthesia, mice were challenged with intranasal (i.n.) PR8 infection (50 PFU in 50 μl of sterile 1X PBS), or 1X PBS only (controls). Mice were weighed daily and assessed for visual signs of clinical disease including inactivity, ruffled fur, labored respiration, and huddling behavior. Mice that lost 30% of their original body weight were euthanized.
Multichannel spinning-disk confocal intravital microscope was used to image mouse lungs. The set up was adapted from previously described work ( Headley et al., 2016 26. Headley, M.B. ∙ Bins, A. ∙ Nip, A. ... Visualization of immediate immune responses to pioneer metastatic cells in the lung Nature. 2016; 531 :513-517 Crossref Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar ; Looney et al., 2011 41. Looney, M.R. ∙ Thornton, E.E. ∙ Sen, D. ... Stabilized imaging of immune surveillance in the mouse lung Nat. Methods. 2011; 8 :91-96 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Mice were anaesthetized (10 mg/Kg xylazine hydrochloride and 200 mg/Kg ketamine hydrochloride) and the body temperature maintained at 37°C using a heating pad (CU-201, Live Cell Instruments). The right jugular vein was cannulated to administer fluorescent dyes and additional anesthetic. The trachea of the mouse was exposed, and a small catheter was threaded into the trachea. The catheter was then attached to a small rodent ventilator (Harvard Apparatus). The mouse was placed on its right lateral decubitus position. A small surgical incision was made and the intercostal muscles between ribs 4 and 5 was gently teased apart forming ∼1.5cm opening. Intercostal lung window was then carefully placed between ribs 4 and 5. The lung was stabilized with a suction of ∼20 mmHg. Images were acquired with an upright microscope (BX51; Olympus) using a 10X/0.45 NA and 20X/0.75 NA XLUM Plan F1 objectives (Olympus). The microscope was equipped with a confocal light path (WaveFx, Quorum) based on a modified Yokogawa CSU-10 head (Yokogawa Electric). A 512 × 512 pixel back-thinned electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera (C9100-13, Hamamatsu) was used for fluorescence detection. Simultaneous behavior of multiple cell types in the lung was assessed using three (488, 561, and 635-nm) laser excitation wavelengths (Cobalt, Stockholm, Sweden) in rapid succession and visualized with the appropriate long-pass filters (Semrock, Rochester, NY). Time-lapse series (xyzt series; 2 hours) were either taken as single plane or z stack (20μm stack with 3μm step size). For cell migration dynamics, xyzt series were registered, projected (maximum intensity), and 10-20 AMs/FOV were randomly identified and manually tracked using ICY. Whole mount images were acquired as either single plane or z stack (40-80μm or stack with 1μm step size). FIJI, ICY ( de Chaumont et al., 2012 15. de Chaumont, F. ∙ Dallongeville, S. ∙ Chenouard, N. ... Icy: an open bioimage informatics platform for extended reproducible research Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :690-696 Crossref Scopus (1039) PubMed Google Scholar ) bio-image analysis software, Volocity (Quorum Technologies) or Imaris (Bitplane) were used for image analysis.
Lyophilized Pertussis toxin (PTx) (Sigma) was reconstituted in sterile saline. Mice were administered 10ng (total) PTx in 50μL saline. Control mice received equal volume of saline only. For these experiments, PTx or saline was administered 3 days prior via oropharyngeal method.
LPS ( E. Coli O111:B4, Sigma) was reconstituted in sterile saline. Mice were administered 10μg LPS oropharyngeal method. Control mice received equal volume of saline only.
75 μL of Chlodronate liposomes (CLL) ( chlodronateliposome.org ) was administered directly into the lung via oropharyngeal method. Mice were treated 5 days prior to experiments. Our pilot experiments indicated that 24-48 hours after CLL, pronounced neutrophil infiltration exists in the lung and the alveolar spaces. This subsides by day 5.
30 μg of Anti-LFA-1 antibody (BioXcell) or isotype control (BioXcell) was administered via oropharyngeal method to block LFA-1 in AMs in vivo . Mice were image 3 hours after administering blocking antibodies. 30 μg of anti-CD88 (Biolegend) or isotype control (Biolegend) antibodies were administered to mice via oropharyngeal method to block CD88 in AMs. Mice were inoculated with P. aeruginosa (live or fixed as per experiment) 1.5 hours after antibody treatment.
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (200 mg/Kg, 10 mg/Kg, respectively). 7.5μg of PE-Cy7 labeled anti-CD45 antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific) was injected in a total volume 150μL of sterile saline i.v via the tail vein (CD45IV). Body temperature was maintained at 37°C. Mice were euthanized with CO 2 10 minutes after i.v. administration of the antibody. The trachea was exposed and cannulated. 1mL of 1% BSA (in PBS) containing 4 μg of APC-e780 labeled anti-CD45 antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific) (CD45IT) was infused into the lung. 10 minutes later, the lungs were excised and immersed in 1mL of IC fixation buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 2 minutes while chopping. 4mL of 2% BSA (in PBS) was then added and the mixture stored on ice until further processing for FACS.
Mice were euthanized with CO 2 . The trachea was exposed and cannulated with 20G catheter (Surflo). 0.8mL 1X PBS (4°C) was gently infused followed by extraction. This was repeated 5 times. Total recovered volume was ∼3.5-3.7 mL/mouse. The BAL fluid was then centrifuged at 1500RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was separated and for some experiments turbidity was assessed using spectrophotometer. The cell pellets were subjected to ACK lysis (GIBCO) for 2 minutes, washed in 2% FBS (in PBS) and stored on ice until staining. For quantification of BAL fluid proteins, BAL fluid supernatants were spun at 15000 RPM to pellet cell debris. Protein in supernatant was quantified by using Pierce BCA protein quantification kit (ThermoFisher), as per manufacturer’s instructions. For quantification of BAL fluid cholesterol levels, BAL fluid supernatants were spun at 15000 RPM. Total cholesterol in supernatant was quantified by using Cholesterol/Cholesteryl Ester Assay Kit (Abcam), as per manufacturer’s instructions. For quantification of cytokines, 0.8mL 1X PBS (4°C) was infused followed by extraction. This was repeated 2 times. For quantification of cytokines, samples were spun at 15000 RPM to pellet cell debris. 32-plex mouse chemokine/cytokine magnetic bead panel assay was used to analyze resulting BAL fluid supernatants (Millipore Sigma, MCYTMAG-70K-PX32). Assays were performed according to factory protocol.
AMs extracted by performing BAL or FACS sorted were resuspended in 5% FBS (in RPMI 1640). Chemotaxis assay was performed using transwell insert (VWR) with 8 μm pores. Briefly, 31,000 AMs added to the top chamber, the bottom chamber contained 5% FBS (in RPMI 1640) and 5% fresh mouse serum (to induce C5a production). Cells were allowed to migrate for 4 hours in 37°C incubator with 5% CO 2 . Later, transwell inserts were stained with Hemacolor stain (Sigma), cells on the input side of the tranwell inserts were scraped off with cotton tip applicator. The transwell membranes were then removed and mounted on slides. Images (using 40X objective) of 5 FOV were taken with inverted microscope equipped with camera. Cells were counted and total sum of 5 40X high power field of view, averaged over two technical replicates, were reported. Pilot experiments were carried out to confirm that AMs did not migrate toward bottom chamber when stimulus ( P. aeruginosa ) was not present. For experiments with stimulus present, 1 × 10 7 CFU of P. aeruginosa was added to the bottom chamber. For experiments with antibody mediated blocking of C5aR1, 2μg of anti-CD88 (Biolegend) or isotype control (Biolegend) antibodies were added to the top well (with AMs) for 10 minutes prior to addition of stimulus (in the bottom well).
Flu infected mice were given 600μg of anti-IFN (clone XMG1.2, BioXcell) or isotype antibody (BioXcell), i.p. on days 4, 6, 8, and 10 after flu infection according to Califano et al. (2018b) 10. Califano, D. ∙ Furuya, Y. ∙ Roberts, S. ... IFN-γ increases susceptibility to influenza A infection through suppression of group II innate lymphoid cells Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11 :209-219 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar .
Mice were euthanized with CO 2 . Lungs were removed, minced, and placed in 1mL of IC fixation buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 2 minutes while chopping, allowing for immediate fixation of epitopes ( Patel et al., 2015 51. Patel, B.V. ∙ Tatham, K.C. ∙ Wilson, M.R. ... In vivo compartmental analysis of leukocytes in mouse lungs Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2015; 309 :L639-L652 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). 4mL of 2% BSA (in PBS) was then added to the mixture. The lungs (with the mixture) was pressed through a 40μm filter using the plunger of a 3mL syringe, washed with excess volume of 2% BSA (in PBS), spun down at 1800 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded. Residual red blood cells were lysed using ACK (GIBCO) for 5 minutes. Cells were stained for 20 minutes with indicated markers. Cells (from lung or BAL fluid, above) were stained with appropriate antibody cocktails at 4°C. Blocking antibody (2.4G2, BioXCell) was included in the antibody cocktail. FMO controls were used when appropriate. AnnexinV staining was performed as per manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples were run using FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Mice were euthanized with CO 2 . Lungs were removed aseptically, minced, and placed in 1mL of ice cold sterile 2% FBS (in PBS with 2mM EDTA). To maintain sterility and minimize activation of AMs, lungs were gently pressed through 100μm filter using a 3mL syringe for 3 without collagenase digestion and washed with excess volume of 2% FBS (in PBS with 2mM EDTA). Cells were spun down at 1500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded. Residual red blood cells were lysed using ACK (GIBCO) for 5 minutes. Cells were stained for viability using fixable viability dye (ThermoFisher Scientific), followed by blocking (2.4G2) and then staining for anti-CD45, anti-SiglecF, anti-CD11c for 20 minutes, in dark at 4°C. 200,000-300,000 Viable AMs (CD45 + CD11c + SiglecF + ) were sorted using FACSaria (BD) and immediately resuspended in Trizol (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Mice were euthanized with CO 2 . BAL was performed and cells collected as mentioned above. Cells were stained for viability using fixable viability dye (ThermoFisher Scientific), followed by blocking (2.4G2) and then staining for anti-CD45, anti-SiglecF, anti-CD11c for 20 minutes, in dark at 4°C. Viable AMs (CD45 + CD11c + SiglecF + ) were sorted using FACSaria (BD) into ice cold 5% FBS (in RPM 1640), pelleted by centrifugation (1800 RPM, 4°C, 5 minutes). Chemotaxis assay was then performed.
RNA was extracted utilizing the Zymo Direct-zol Microkit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and checked for quantity and quality via spectrophotometry and Agilent bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies). Sufficient quality RNA was converted to libraries utilizing TruSeq Total Stranded RNA chemistry (Illumina), and libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. For all sequencing data, reads were quality checked for read counts, quality values, kmer usage, GC content, and all other relevant parameters with FastQC (v0.10.1) and custom scripts. Paired-end reads (75 base pairs, paired end) were mapped to mouse reference genome (UCSC mm10; February 2011 release; Genome Reference Consortium GRCm38; gtf annotation file GRCm38), using STAR (v2.5.2) ( Dobin et al., 2013 17. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27081) PubMed Google Scholar ) with at least 80% mapping rates and were quantified as transcripts per million (TPM) using RSEM (v1.2.30) ( Li and Dewey, 2011 39. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13979) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two samples were removed from the analysis due to poor sequencing quality. TPM values for the remaining samples were pedestaled to a value of 0.2 and log2 transformed. Genes constitutively expressed at low levels (TPM < 1) were removed from the analysis. Differentially expressed genes were determined by a Welch two sample t test (influenza versus controls) with multiple test correction using the BH procedure (log2|fc| > 1, BH p value < 0.01). GSEA was carried out using metascape ( Zhou et al., 2019 80. Zhou, Y. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Pache, L. ... Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1523 Crossref Scopus (7477) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pathway analysis was carried out using enrichR ( Chen et al., 2013 12. Chen, E.Y. ∙ Tan, C.M. ∙ Kou, Y. ... Enrichr: interactive and collaborative HTML5 gene list enrichment analysis tool BMC Bioinformatics. 2013; 14 :128 Crossref Scopus (4208) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuleshov et al., 2016 37. Kuleshov, M.V. ∙ Jones, M.R. ∙ Rouillard, A.D. ... Enrichr: a comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis web server 2016 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 W90-7 Crossref Scopus (5607) PubMed Google Scholar ) using genes that were upregulated in AMs after influenza infection.
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (200 mg/Kg, 10 mg/Kg, respectively) and 4μg of anti-CD31 (PECAM-1, ThermoFisher Scientific) was injected i.v. (in some experiments). 10 minutes later, mice were euthanized with CO 2. The trachea was exposed and cannulated with 20G catheter. The lungs were inflated using 800μL of warm (40°C) 4% low melting agarose (in 4% PFA/PBS) (Invitrogen). Once the agarose solidified, individual lobes of the lung were removed and washed in cold PBS. The lobes were then washed overnight in 4% PFA (in PBS) at 4°C. The lobes were washed 3 times with 1X PBS and then sliced into 150 μm slices using a vibratome (Leica). Lung slices were blocked in 3% BSA (in 0.1% PBST) and 2μg FC block (2.4G2) for 3 hours then stained in the same solution with appropriate concentration of fluorescently conjugated antibodies for 12-17 hours at 4°C. Samples were washed in 3% BSA (in 0.1% PBST) 2 times followed by wash in 1X PBS. Slices were mounted onto Superfrost plus slides imaged using multichannel spinning disk confocal microscope (described above).
Mice were euthanized with CO 2 . The trachea was exposed and cannulated with 20G catheter. The lungs were inflated with pre-fix solution (1.6% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3). Trachea was ligated and the lungs were removed and immersed in pre-fix solution for 1 hour. The lungs were then transferred to post-fix solution (cacodylate-buffered 1% osmium tetroxide) for 1 hour at room temperature. Lungs were dehydrated through graded ethanol and embedded in epon mixture. Embedded tissues were trimmed and glued to resinstub for sectioning. Ultrathin sections were cut with diamond knife on an ultramicrotome (Ultracut E; Reichert-Jung) and collected on single-hole grids with Formvar supporting film. The sections were stained with aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate and observed under Hitachi H7650TEM at 80 kV. The images were acquired with AMT16000 digital camera mounted on the microscope.
Mice were euthanized with CO 2 . The trachea was exposed and cannulated with 20G catheter. The lungs were inflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin (fixative), excised, and immersed in fixative for 24 hours and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were reviewed by a blinded pulmonary clinical pathologist.
Microarray data generated by ImmGen consortium ( Heng et al., 2008 28. Heng, T.S.P. ∙ Painter, M.W., Immunological Genome Project Consortium The Immunological Genome Project: networks of gene expression in immune cells Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :1091-1094 Crossref Scopus (1333) PubMed Google Scholar ) (GSE37448) was used for Figure 2 A and Figure S2 A. Data were log 2 transformed, filtered to exclude non-macrophage (MF) and knock-out (GATA6ko) population. This resulted in a group of 5 MF populations: Interstitial MF (Lung), Alveolar MF (Lung), Adipose MF (Adipose Tissue), F480hi MF (Liver), F480hi MF (Peritoneum). For Figure 2 A, we performed EDA by selecting the top 1% of probes with the highest variation. Integrin specific probes among these were filtered and displayed as Heatmap. For Figure S2A where we assessed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AMs, we compared microarray data for AMs with IM (interstitial lung macrophages) as they represent a distinct population of cells both of which reside in the lung ( Aran et al., 2019 3. Aran, D. ∙ Looney, A.P. ∙ Liu, L. ... Reference-based analysis of lung single-cell sequencing reveals a transitional profibrotic macrophage Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :163-172 Crossref Scopus (1976) PubMed Google Scholar ). DEGs were identified as genes that had a |log 2 Fold Change| > 1.5 and FDR adjusted P value < 0.05. Adhesion related genes were obtained from GO ( http://www.geneontology.org ; search term: cell adhesion) and labels for adhesion related DEGs were created.
Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM software (Graphpad). All values are expressed as Mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated in the figure legend. For two groups, when applicable, unpaired Student’s t test was performed. Otherwise, Mann-Whitney test was performed. When assessing multiple groups, for parametric data, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test was performed. For non-parametric data, Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s post hoc test was performed. Statistical significance was accepted at α < 0.05.
