Title: Mechanoreceptor signal convergence and transformation in the dorsal horn flexibly shape a diversity of outputs to the brain


Abstract: Summary

The encoding of touch in the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) and its influence on tactile representations in the brain are poorly understood. Using a range of mechanical stimuli applied to the skin, large-scale in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and genetic manipulations, here we show that neurons in the mouse spinal cord DH receive convergent inputs from both low- and high-threshold mechanoreceptor subtypes and exhibit one of six functionally distinct mechanical response profiles. Genetic disruption of DH feedforward or feedback inhibitory motifs, comprised of interneurons with distinct mechanical response profiles, revealed an extensively interconnected DH network that enables dynamic, flexible tuning of postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) output neurons and dictates how neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex respond to touch. Thus, mechanoreceptor subtype convergence and non-linear transformations at the earliest stage of the somatosensory hierarchy shape how touch of the skin is represented in the brain.

Section: Introduction

Fundamental to understanding the neurobiological basis of touch sensation is knowing how signals from primary mechanosensory neurons are combined and transformed as they ascend the somatosensory neuraxis to encode salient features of mechanical stimuli.
The mechanosensory neurons associated with glabrous (non-hairy) skin include Aβ rapidly adapting low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) that innervate either Meissner or Pacinian corpuscles (Aβ RA1- and Aβ RA2-LTMRs, respectively), Aβ slowly adapting (SA)-LTMRs that associate with Merkel cells, and A- and C-fiber high-threshold mechanoreceptor (HTMR) subtypes 1 1.

Mechanosensory pathways conveying touch signals from the periphery to the brain include: (1) the “direct dorsal column pathway”, which carries Aβ-LTMR signals from the skin directly to the brainstem dorsal column nuclei (DCN), where second order neurons project to the somatosensory thalamus and other higher brain regions; (2) the “indirect dorsal column pathway”, which conveys mechanosensory signals from the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) to the DCN via postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) neurons; and (3) the anterolateral pathway, which transmits signals from the spinal cord to the somatosensory thalamus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, and other brain regions that process nociceptive and affective aspects of somatosensation.
How and where in the CNS are signals from peripheral mechanoreceptor subtypes combined to generate central representations of touch? Recent studies indicate that tactile responses in the somatosensory cortex (S1), thalamus, and DCN reflect subcortical convergence of Aβ LTMR subtype signals. 14 14.

Indeed, the spinal cord DH may serve as the initial locus of mechanoreceptor subtype signal integration. In support of this idea, the majority of Aβ LTMR synapses are localized to the DH, with relatively few residing in the DCN. 1 1. Perl, E.R.

Here, we found that the DH has a highly interconnected network architecture, receiving extensively convergent LTMR and HTMR signals and transforming them into a diverse range of PSDC output channels. Thus, the DH flexibly shapes PSDC signals that ascend via the indirect dorsal column pathway to the DCN, where they combine with unmodified Aβ LTMR signals of the direct dorsal column pathway to dictate how touch of the body is represented in the brain.

The types of neuron which contain protein kinase C gamma in rat spinal cord Brain Res. 1999; 833 :71-80 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar We sought to complement and extend these prior analyses using large-scale in vivo electrophysiology to address: (1) the in vivo mechanical response properties of DH neurons, including genetically defined interneurons and PSDC output neurons; (2) the contributions of LTMR subtypes, HTMRs, and local circuit motifs in shaping these responses; and (3) the contribution of DH mechanosensory processing to S1 responses and somatosensory behaviors. We developed a preparation for in vivo spinal cord multielectrode array (MEA) electrophysiology and recorded simultaneously from dozens of lumbar DH neurons while delivering well-controlled mechanical stimuli to the plantar hindpaw surface of urethane anesthetized mice ( Figure 1 A, S1 B and S1C). Step indentations spanning mechanical activation thresholds of both LTMRs and HTMRs were used to assess force intensity tuning of DH neurons residing within spinal cord laminae I–V and allow for direct comparisons to responses of primary afferent mechanoreceptors ( Figures S1 A–S1D). Indentations within this force range did not evoke a nociceptive behavioral response in awake mice. 15 15. Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Panzeri, S. ... Cortical responses to touch reflect subcortical integration of LTMR signals Nature. 2021; 600 :680-685 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar For spatial RF measurements, the same step indentations were applied to different locations across the paw. In addition, vibratory stimuli of varying force amplitudes and frequencies were delivered to the RF center. A total of 5,060 single unit recordings from 142 mice were included in initial stages of this analysis ( Figures 1 C and S1 E).
Remarkably, the vast majority of lumbar DH neurons recorded (92%) responded to innocuous force steps with a broad range of functional response profiles ( Figure 1 B). We used unsupervised clustering to assess the extent of this functional diversity ( Figures 1 C and S1 E). This analysis divided DH units into six principal functional groups distinguished by their responses across the full range of indentation intensities ( Figures 1 D–1I) and abundance ( Figure 1 J). A similar fraction of broad response types was consistent across experiments ( Figure S1 F).
DH neurons across the six functional clusters differed in their sensitivity to step indentations, with sensitivities and sustained responses tiling mechanical force space ( Figures 1 E and 1H). DH neurons in cluster 3 were the most sensitive, with 30% responding to 1 mN, the lowest force amplitude tested ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Neurons in clusters 2 and 6 were the least sensitive, exhibiting minimal responses at lower forces. Cluster 6 harbors neurons uniquely inhibited by high-intensity force steps. DH functional clusters were also distinguished by their spiking patterns at the ON, OFF, and sustained portion of step indentations ( Figure 1 D and 1F–1I). Units in clusters 1 and 2 exhibited transient response profiles, with robust spiking during the ON phase and little to no response during the sustained portion of the step ( Figure 1 D and 1F–1H). Cluster 1 neurons often lacked an OFF response ( Figures 1 D and 1G). Neurons in clusters 3, 4, and 5, on the other hand, displayed prominent sustained responses that were most pronounced at higher forces ( Figures 1 D and 1H). DH functional types also differed in their spontaneous firing rates ( Figure S1 H). Surprisingly, neurons within different functional groups were broadly distributed across laminar depth ( Figure 1 K), although insensitive units tended to reside more superficially, and more sensitive units tended to reside deeper in the DH ( Figures 1 K and S1 I).
RF analysis revealed that RF areas varied across DH functional cluster types and were exclusively excitatory with no inhibitory surround ( Figures 2 A–2C and S2 A–S2C). Additionally, the most sensitive DH neurons tended to have the largest RFs. Indeed, units in cluster 3, the most sensitive cluster, exhibited the largest RFs at 10 mN (median 14.75 mm 2 ), while units in cluster 2, with some of the highest activation thresholds, had the smallest RFs (median 2.34 mm 2 ; Figures 2 B and 2C). It is notable that RFs for virtually all DH units in the dataset and representing all excitatory functional clusters are considerably larger than individual Aβ RA-LTMR and Aβ SA-LTMR RFs, even at the lowest forces used, suggesting a high degree of convergence of primary mechanosensory neuron signals onto individual DH neurons.
We also investigated how DH neurons encode mechanical vibrations ( Figures 2 D–2F). Only a small subset of mechanically sensitive DH neurons (∼15%) entrained their firing to vibrations up to 120 Hz ( Figure 2 D, 2E and S2 E). In contrast, the sensitivity of most DH neurons across all clusters increased (i.e., force thresholds decreased) as the frequency of vibration increased, to 120 Hz ( Figures 2 D–2F and S2 D). These findings suggest that most DH neurons receive convergent input, either directly or indirectly, from Meissner corpuscle Aβ RA1-LTMRs and Pacinian corpuscle Aβ RA2-LTMRs, most sensitive to 20–100 Hz and 100–500 Hz vibratory stimuli, respectively. 6 6.

To determine whether the properties of known genetically defined DH interneurons align with particular functional clusters, we combined in vivo MEA recordings with optical tagging of genetically defined DH interneuron types (example shown in Figures 3 A–3C and S3 A–S3D). Thus, we selectively recorded from (1) broad DH neuron populations subdivided based on neurotransmitter identity and (2) a sampling of previously described morphologically and physiologically distinct excitatory and inhibitory DH interneuron types ( Figures 3 D–3J). The in vivo response properties and RFs of genetically labeled DH interneurons were then compared to those of DH functional types defined by unbiased clustering.
To compare broadly across inhibitory and excitatory populations, both GABAergic and glycinergic interneurons were optotagged using Vgat iCre ; R26 LSL-ChR2 mice ( Figures S3 E and S3F). Blocking excitatory transmission in the spinal cord to suppress recurrent excitation at the end of optotagging experiments allowed for unambiguous identification of tagged units ( Figures 3 A–3C and S3 A–S3D). We found that DH inhibitory interneurons were more sensitive and produced more sustained responses at higher indentation forces than simultaneously recorded putative excitatory DH units ( Figures 3 G, S3 E, and S3F). Inhibitory interneurons also exhibited larger RFs than their excitatory interneuron counterparts ( Figure 3 H). Despite these differences, there was substantial heterogeneity among inhibitory and excitatory neuron response profiles, as illustrated by functional cluster assignments of both subtypes ( Figures S3 E and S3F).
We next sampled five genetically defined DH interneuron populations using interneuron specific Cre-driver lines and either ChR2 or ReaChR actuator lines 47 47.

Each population predominantly mapped onto one or more of the six functional response profiles ( Figures 1 D, 1E, and S3 G–S3K). Optotagged Rorβ inhibitory interneurons had transient responses to indentation, with little to no sustained response and modest OFF responses at low forces, and thus the majority mapped onto DH functional cluster 1 ( Figures 3 D and 3F). In contrast, tagged PV inhibitory interneurons (PVi) exhibited pronounced sustained and OFF responses to step indentations, low force thresholds, and large RFs ( Figures 3 E–3H), and thus were mostly assigned to DH functional cluster 3 ( Figure 3 E). Inhibitory Kcnip2 interneurons had a distinct cluster assignment, reflecting their unique sustained firing patterns, high spontaneous firing rates, and small RFs ( Figures 3 G, 3H, S3 I, and S3L). In contrast, CCK excitatory lineage neurons exhibited some of the smallest RFs ( Figure 3 H). Interestingly, optotagged PKCγ neurons, a subset of spatially restricted DH excitatory interneurons, had homogeneous response properties with higher sensitivity and larger RFs compared to other excitatory interneuron populations ( Figures 3 G, 3H, and S3 K). Thus, while functional cluster 2 may be comprised exclusively of excitatory interneurons ( Figures S3 E–S3K), clusters 1 and 3 both harbor distinct combinations of genetically labeled excitatory and inhibitory interneuron subtypes ( Figure 3 D, 3E, and S3 G–S3K). Interestingly, 60% of PKCγ excitatory interneurons were phase-locked to vibratory stimuli, compared to only 6% of the broad CCK excitatory interneuron population ( Figures 3 I and 3J). On the other hand, each of the five optotagged interneuron populations exhibited vibration frequency-dependent sensitivity ( Figure S3 M). Together, these findings point to a broadly distributed arrangement of mechanically sensitive DH neurons that fall into six principal functional clusters, likely corresponding to one or more genetically defined interneuron types with distinct intrinsic physiological, morphological, and synaptic properties.
To assess the contributions of mechanoreceptor subtype inputs to the range of DH neuron physiological response profiles, we next used sensory neuron loss-of-function and gain-of-function manipulations in conjunction with in vivo MEA recordings. We first asked whether DH neuron responsivity to skin indentation is dependent on the mechanosensory ion channel Piezo2. 49 49. Ranade, S.S. ∙ Woo, S.H. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ... Piezo2 is the major transducer of mechanical forces for touch sensation in mice Nature. 2014; 516 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (579) PubMed Google Scholar Remarkably, DH neurons of mice in which Piezo2 was deleted from all neurons below cervical level 2 ( Cdx2-Cre; Piezo2 flox/flox mice 50 50. Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Santiago, C. ∙ Huey, E.L. ...

We next assessed the contributions of Aβ RA- and Aβ SA-LTMRs to distinct DH responses using genetic ablation strategies that result in loss of Meissner corpuscles and their associated Aβ RA-LTMRs ( Advillin Cre ; TrkB flox/flox mice, 51 51. Neubarth, N.L. ∙ Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Meissner corpuscles and their spatially intermingled afferents underlie gentle touch perception Science. 2020; 368 :eabb2751 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar referred to as TrkB cKO ) or loss of both Meissner corpuscles/Aβ RA-LTMRs and Merkel cells, required for normal Aβ SA-LTMR responses ( Advillin Cre ; TrkB flox/flox ; Atoh1 flox/flox , referred to as DKO 15 15. Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Panzeri, S. ... Cortical responses to touch reflect subcortical integration of LTMR signals Nature. 2021; 600 :680-685 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). DH neurons from DKO mice exhibited dramatically decreased sensitivity compared to control littermates ( Figures 4 A–4G) and showed no ON responses to indentation forces below 20 mN. Similarly, DH neuron sensitivity and ON responses were diminished, albeit to a lesser degree, in TrkB cKO mice. In addition, OFF responses were virtually absent at low forces and reduced at higher force intensities in both TrkB cKO and DKO mice ( Figures 4 B, 4C, 4E, and 4F). DH units from DKO mice also lacked phase-locked responses at most vibration frequencies tested ( Figures 4 H and 4J). A few DH units in DKO mice did exhibit phase-locking at 120 Hz ( Figure 4 H), presumably because high-frequency skin vibrations >100 Hz are transduced by intact Aβ RA2-LTMRs associated with Pacinian corpuscles. Consistent with this, both TrkB cKO and DKO mice lacked frequency tuning below 80 Hz but did exhibit normal responsivity in the Pacinian range, above 80 Hz ( Figure 4 I).
Interestingly, the fraction of DH units spiking during the ON and sustained portions at forces >20 mN was comparable between TrkB cKO , DKO, and control mice ( Figures 4 C and 4F). This finding suggests that LTMR and HTMR signals converge onto the majority, and possibly all, mechanically sensitive DH neurons. To further address this, we next generated Nav1.8 Cre ; Piezo2 flox/flox mice in which Piezo2 is deleted from a large fraction of small- and medium-diameter neurons, including many HTMRs, but not from Aβ RA- and Aβ SA-LTMRs ( Figures S4 E and S4F). As predicted, DH neurons in Nav1.8 Cre ; Piezo2 flox/flox mice exhibited no changes in mechanical response thresholds compared to littermate controls ( Figure S4 J). However, these mutants did exhibit diminished firing at indentation forces at and above 10 mN during the sustained portion of step indentations ( Figures S4 G and S4H). This reduction is modest and likely an underestimation of the HTMR contribution due to incomplete Piezo2 deletion in Nav1.8 Cre ; Piezo2 flox/flox mice ( Figures S4 E and S4F).
To assess the sufficiency of select LTMR subtypes and HTMRs for DH neuron activation across the functional cluster types, we next compared DH neuron responses to (1) mechanical stimuli and (2) optogenetic stimuli applied to the same skin region to selectively activate one or more somatosensory neuron types ( Figure 5 A). Genetic driver lines were used to express ReaChR in select populations of sensory neurons (see Methods), and brief light pulses applied to the skin triggered one action potential in a few sensory neurons. 15 15. Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Panzeri, S. ... Cortical responses to touch reflect subcortical integration of LTMR signals Nature. 2021; 600 :680-685 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar Strikingly, selective optogenetic activation of either Aβ RA- or Aβ SA-LTMRs evoked short-latency responses in the majority of DH units ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Furthermore, “optogenetic RFs” of DH neurons, mapped using patterned optogenetic stimuli to selectively activate Aβ RA- or Aβ SA-LTMRs across the skin, were compared to the mechanical RFs of Aβ RA- or Aβ SA-LTMRs ( Figure 5 D), allowing us to compute homotypic convergence estimates. On average, individual DH neurons receive convergent inputs from seven or more of these Aβ-LTMR subtypes ( Figure 5 D).
Cutaneous optogenetic stimulation of DCN-projecting Aβ-fiber sensory neurons ( Figure 5 E; Methods) evoked only short latency responses in virtually all mechanically sensitive DH neurons. In contrast, cutaneous optogenetic activation of all somatosensory neurons (using Advillin-FlpO; R26 FSF−ReaChR -mCitrine mice) elicited both short and long latency responses ( Figure 5 E). Similar short and long latency responses were observed following electrical stimulation of the skin and were indicative of A- and C-fiber inputs, respectively ( Figure S5 K). Broad optogenetic activation of HTMRs and other sensory neuron types, using both Nav1.8 Cre lineage and CGRP CreER driver lines, also triggered both short (A-fiber) and long (C-fiber; >100 ms) latency responses ( Figures 5 E and 5F) in the majority of DH neurons ( Figure 5 H). In fact, as observed for Aβ RA-, Aβ SA-LTMRs, and DCN-projecting Aβ-fiber sensory neurons, optogenetic activation A-fiber CGRP + DRG neurons, which are HTMRs, 3 3.

Intriguingly, optical RFs for A- and C-fiber-evoked responses overlapped somatotopically for the majority of DH units ( Figure 5 G). Finally, optogenetic activation of Mrgprd + HTMRs evoked exclusively long-latency responses ( Figures 5 E–5G), as expected for these C-fiber neurons, and across DH units corresponding to all functional cluster types ( Figures 5 H and 5I).
Together, these primary sensory neuron loss-of-function and gain-of-function manipulations suggest that parallel signals from physiologically distinct Aβ-LTMR subtypes and HTMRs differentially combine to shape the mechanical responses of DH neurons broadly, across all functional cluster types.
To begin to define the role of local DH circuit motifs in shaping the responses of DH interneurons and output neurons, we next assessed synaptic connectivity between primary afferents and PSDC output neurons, and the contributions of Rorβ and PVi inhibitory interneurons to feedforward and feedback inhibition in acute spinal cord slices ( Figure 6 A). Photostimulation of Aβ RA- or Aβ SA-LTMR central terminals evoked both large monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) ( Figures 6 A–6C and S5 A) and strychnine-sensitive polysynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in PSDC neurons through feedforward inhibition (FFI) in the local DH circuit ( Figures 6 B–6E and S5 A). Moreover, optogenetic activation of Nav1.8 + sensory neuron terminals evoked smaller, polysynaptic EPSCs in PSDC neurons ( Figure S5 B). On the other hand, optogenetic stimulation of Rorβ interneurons evoked strong monosynaptic IPSCs ( Figures 6 F and 6G) and, in current clamp experiments, directly suppressed the activity and excitability of neighboring PSDCs ( Figure 6 H and S5 C). Consistent with this, Rorβ interneurons form inhibitory synaptic contacts onto the perisomatic compartment of PSDC neurons ( Figure S5 H). In contrast, optogenetic activation of PVi neurons failed to evoke direct, monosynaptic IPSCs in PSDC neurons ( Figure 6 K).
In related experiments, we used dorsal root electrical stimulation 20 20. Abraira, V.E. ∙ Kuehn, E.D. ∙ Chirila, A.M. ...

Inhibiting Rorβ interneurons using two different chronic silencing strategies strongly attenuated Aβ-fiber evoked glycinergic FFI onto PSDC neurons, resulting in a 3-fold increase in E/I conductance ratios ( Figure 6 I). In addition, acute optogenetic silencing of Rorβ neurons suppressed 50% of FFI onto PSDC neurons without affecting monosynaptic excitatory transmission from sensory afferents ( Figure S5 E). We also assessed the role of presynaptic inhibition (PSI) of primary afferent terminals in sensory-evoked EPSCs to PSDC neurons, which is mediated in part by axo-axonic synapses formed by PVi inhibitory interneurons onto primary afferent terminals. 20 20.

We next assessed the contributions of sensory-evoked inhibition in shaping in vivo DH interneuron responses to mechanical stimuli. Disrupting Rorβ neuron-mediated FFI or GABA A R-mediated PSI caused a dramatic increase in sensitivity and spiking responses of DH neurons to step indentations ( Figures 6 L–6M and S5 I). Moreover, while loss of either form of inhibition shifted DH response profiles into a more sensitive range ( Figure 6 M), DH response cluster diversity was differentially altered following FFI and PSI disruption ( Figure 6 N). In complementary experiments, we found that acute optogenetic silencing of Rorβ or PVi interneurons increased sensitivity and indentation evoked spiking in a subset of neighboring DH units ( Figure S5 F and S5G).
Inactivation of Rorβ-mediated FFI and GABA A R-mediated PSI similarly increased RFs across all recorded DH neurons ( Figure 6 O) and cluster types ( Figures 6 P). However, although RFs measured at the ON response were significantly larger in both the FFI and PSI mutants ( Figure 6 O), RFs measured during the sustained and OFF portions of indentation steps in the FFI mutants, but not the PSI mutants, differed from controls ( Figure S5 J). Moreover, DH neuron phase-locking to vibratory stimuli was nearly abolished in the absence of FFI or PSI ( Figure 6 Q).
Finally, the potential contribution of one form of sensory-evoked inhibition, Rorβ interneuron-mediated FFI, to high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-evoked plasticity of DH responses was tested. Remarkably, cutaneous HFS electrical stimulation evoked rapid and marked increases in both sustained responses and RF properties across a large cohort of DH neurons in control mice, but not in mice lacking Rorβ-neuron-mediated FFI ( Figures 6 R and S5 K–S5M). Related to this, in spinal cord slice recordings, dorsal root HFS triggered robust long-term potentiation (LTP) of Aβ sensory neuron synapses onto PSDC output neurons, and this form of plasticity was virtually absent in slices from mice lacking Rorβ-interneuron-mediated glycinergic FFI ( Figure S5 N).
Together, these findings indicate that FFI and PSI, and thus the interneurons mediating these distinct forms of synaptic inhibition, including interneurons assigned to clusters 1 and 3, shape the mechanical responses of most and possibly all DH neurons across all functional cluster types. This finding supports a model in which DH interneurons are functionally inter-dependent: interneurons of one functional type shape the mechanical responses and RFs of other DH interneuron types. Moreover, DH neuron response properties and RFs across functional cluster types flexibly adjust to high-frequency volleys of sensory inputs, and at least one DH inhibitory motif, glycinergic FFI mediated by Rorβ interneurons of cluster 1, is required for this widespread sensory-evoked plasticity.
We next tested the hypothesis that DH output signals conveyed by PSDC neurons reflect extensive convergence of mechanoreceptor inputs and the inter-dependency of DH circuit components found here. Thus, we recorded from PSDC neurons using optogenetic tagging and antidromic activation strategies that enabled in vivo measurements of PSDC tactile-evoked responses in conjunction with sensory neuron and DH neuron functional manipulations ( Figure 7 A and S6 A–S6F; Methods). Overall, tagged PSDC neurons exhibited a surprisingly high diversity of response properties and sensitivities to mechanical step indentations ( Figure 7 B, Methods, S6 K). PSDC neurons also had typically large cutaneous RFs ( Figure S6 I). Although phase-locking to mechanical vibrations exceeding 20 Hz was absent ( Figure S6 J), PSDCs did display vibration frequency-dependent sensitivity ( Figure S6 J). Importantly, selective optogenetic activation of Aβ RA- or Aβ SA-LTMRs evoked action potentials in most PSDC neurons tested, demonstrating extensive convergent input from Aβ-LTMR subtypes ( Figure S6 G and S6H).
Disrupting either Rorβ neuron-mediated FFI or GABA A R-mediated PSI decreased mechanical thresholds and increased indentation-evoked spiking in PSDC neurons ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and 7E). Spiking responses at the ON and OFF portions of step indentations were elevated across the entire force range, demonstrating that both FFI and PSI gate Aβ RA- and Aβ SA-LTMR drive onto PSDC neurons ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S7 A). Responsivity during the sustained phase of step indentations was also strongly elevated at indentation forces that recruit HTMR input, and to a greater extent in mice lacking PSI than in mice lacking FFI ( Figures 7 B, 7C and S7 A). Furthermore, a prominent after-discharge following step indentations was observed in mice lacking PSI, but not FFI, indicating that PSI uniquely contributes to PSDC response kinetics and temporal filtering of mechanosensory inputs ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Moreover, PSDC RFs were substantially larger in the absence of FFI or PSI ( Figures 7 F, 7G, S7 C). Finally, though PSDC neurons in control mice exhibited highly diverse response properties and sensitivities, as observed in the heat maps of individual PSDC responses ( Figure 7 B) and quantified using a coefficient of variation analysis of the entire population ( Figures 7 D and S7 B), PSDCs in mice lacking FFI or PSI had considerably less variation in their mechanical response thresholds, response profiles, and RFs ( Figures 7 D, 7E, S7 B, and S7C). Thus, distinct modes of synaptic inhibition that control mechanical responses across all DH interneuron types are also crucial in shaping the wide diversity of responses in PSDC neurons.
Because PSDC neurons convey tactile information from the DH to the DCN, and as a group exhibited heightened sensitivity and larger RFs following both FFI and PSI disruption, we hypothesized that loss of FFI or PSI in the DH may lead to: (1) increased sensitivity and response amplitudes to skin indentation in downstream neurons, (2) touch-evoked RF expansion, and (3) altered behavioral responses to tactile stimuli. Because the genetic manipulations used to disrupt FFI are restricted to the spinal cord ( Figures S7 F and S7G), we next recorded touch-evoked responses in S1 15 15. Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Panzeri, S. ... Cortical responses to touch reflect subcortical integration of LTMR signals Nature. 2021; 600 :680-685 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar of awake Rorβ iCre ; Vgat flox/flox mice and Vgat flox/flox littermate controls. We found that selective disruption of DH FFI increased S1 neuron spiking at the ON and OFF phase, without altering their transient response profiles ( Figures 7 H, 7I, S7 D, and S7E). We also observed a striking alteration of RF properties of individual S1 units in the absence of DH FFI. Although individual units from hindlimb S1 responded most robustly to hindlimb skin stroking in control mice, S1 units from Rorβ iCre ; Vgat flox/flox mice responded comparably to stroke stimuli applied across the entire contralateral lower body ( Figure 7 J). Moreover, behavioral measurements showed that disruption of Rorβ neuron-mediated FFI caused tactile over-reactivity ( Figure S7 I), deficits in texture discrimination ( Figure S7 J), and an alteration in a sunflower seed handling behavioral assay that assesses the integrity of sensory-motor exchange and dexterous use of the forepaws ( Figure S7 K). Together, these findings indicate that mechanoreceptor signal processing in the DH shapes touch-evoked responses and topographic body representation at supraspinal levels, as well as somatosensory behaviors.

Section: Discussion

Here, we combined large-scale in vivo electrophysiology and a range of functional manipulations to assess spinal cord DH interneuron and output neuron mechanical response type diversity and function. We observed six mechanically sensitive DH neuron functional types based on their sensitivities, tonic and mechanically evoked firing patterns, and RF areas and shapes. A sampling of previously identified genetically labeled interneuron subtypes showed that they map mainly onto one or a few of the functional classes. Our findings from perturbation experiments support a model in which functionally distinct DH interneuron types receive extensively convergent LTMR and HTMR inputs and form a highly interconnected network architecture that serves to flexibly shape a diversity of response properties of PSDC outputs. We also provide evidence that mechanosensory signal transformations within the intricate, interconnected DH network dictate how mechanical forces acting on the skin are represented in the brain.
Several lines of evidence point to a remarkably high degree of Aβ-LTMR subtype signal convergence onto the majority of DH neuron functional types. First , the majority of mechanically sensitive DH units across all functional response types have large and spatially complex RFs when probed with 10 mN force steps, which preferentially activate LTMRs. Because the RFs of Aβ RA- and Aβ SA-LTMRs themselves are considerably smaller than even the smallest DH neuron RFs, DH RFs measured at low indentation forces likely reflect homotypic and/or heterotypic convergence of signals from many individual Aβ RA- and Aβ SA-LTMRs. Second , genetic disruption of Aβ RA- and Aβ SA-LTMR signals resulted in loss of responsivity to 10 mN indentations across all mechanically sensitive DH units, indicating broad contribution of these Aβ-LTMR types to virtually all DH responses in the low force range. Third , cutaneous optogenetic stimuli that selectively evoked single action potentials in Aβ RA- or Aβ SA-LTMRs 15 15. Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Panzeri, S. ... Cortical responses to touch reflect subcortical integration of LTMR signals Nature. 2021; 600 :680-685 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar was sufficient to drive spiking across the majority of DH neurons representing all functional response types, and in PSDC projection neurons. Related to this, the vast majority of DH neurons across all functional response types exhibited broad vibration tuning. Together with the observation that DH units from TrkB cKO mice lack vibration tuning in the Meissner, but not in the Pacinian range, these findings suggest that most DH neurons receive input, either directly or indirectly, from both Meissner corpuscle Aβ RA1-LTMRs and Pacinian corpuscle Aβ RA2-LTMRs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate extensive LTMR subtype signal convergence and non-linear transformations giving rise to distinct DH interneuron and output neuron firing patterns. Moreover, sensory neuron perturbation experiments also revealed that most DH neurons across all functional response types receive inputs from HTMRs, either directly or indirectly. The surprisingly high degree of LTMR and HTMR convergence is also reflected at the level of PSDC neurons. Thus, one consequence of extensive LTMR and HTMR signal convergence in the DH is that the indirect dorsal column pathway encodes mechanical stimuli over a wider dynamic range of intensities, as compared to the direct dorsal column pathway.
How are LTMR and HTMR inputs to the DH transformed into output signals conveyed to other CNS regions, including the DCN? Our findings support a model in which the DH is an interconnected network of circuit elements, with each principal interneuron type uniquely contributing to the responses of other interneuron and output neuron populations. Rorβ interneurons, mapped predominantly to functional class 1, mediate sensory-evoked glycinergic FFI onto PSDC neurons. On the other hand, PVi inhibitory interneurons, which fall mostly into functional class 3, participate in GABA A R-dependent PSI. 20 20. Abraira, V.E. ∙ Kuehn, E.D. ∙ Chirila, A.M. ...

Importantly, these distinct modes of inhibition differentially modulate DH outputs, either directly or indirectly: for example, PSI, but not FFI, governs temporal filtering of PSDC responses to step indentation, through preventing after-discharge spiking following the offset of step indentations. Moreover, FFI has a more widespread effect on PSDC RF size, compared to PSI, and this RF expansion is amplified to an even greater extent in S1. These findings point to a highly inter-dependent DH network model in which interneurons of distinct functional classes, and the circuit motifs they engage, cooperate to shape responses across all DH interneuron types and PSDC outputs.
What is the functional significance of the highly interconnected DH circuitry and its broadly convergent LTMR and HTMR inputs? One clue stems from the finding that PSDCs exhibit highly heterogeneous responses to tactile stimuli. This functional diversity is reminiscent of the broad, heterogeneous tuning and RF properties of output neurons of other early sensory processing areas, including retinal ganglion cells. 60 60.

Biophysical Variation within the M1 Type of Ganglion Cell Photoreceptor Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :1048-1062 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar A second clue comes from the observation that PSDC response properties become remarkably similar in mice lacking FFI or PSI. Indeed, in the absence of the FFI or PSI motifs, virtually all PSDC neurons responded to the lowest indentation forces, exhibited pronounced sustained firing patterns, particularly in the HTMR range, and displayed extremely large RFs. As such, proper DH network function is essential for setting a wide range of sensitivities, response properties, and RFs across the PSDC population. A third clue comes from our observation that bursts of high-frequency afferent stimulation evoked changes in the response properties and RFs of neurons across the DH, consistent with the observation of activity-dependent changes in PSDC RF properties. 29 29. Brown, A.G. ∙ Brown, P.B. ∙ Fyffe, R.E. ... Receptive field organization and response properties of spinal neurones with axons ascending the dorsal columns in the cat J Physiol. 1983; 337 :575-588 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar Relevant to this, afferent stimulation-evoked changes in DH neuron response properties and activity-dependent potentiation of Aβ-LTMR to PSDC synapses are both absent in mice lacking Rorβ neuron-mediated FFI. That the DH is modulated by top-down control via corticospinal inputs is also of interest when considering models of DH network function. Collectively, these observations lead us to propose a model in which the highly interconnected DH circuitry, with its broadly convergent LTMR and HTMR inputs, functions to enable a wide, flexible range of PSDC output neuron sensitivities, firing patterns and RF properties, modifiable by sensory experience and internal state. Future experiments will test how mechanosensory processing in the DH and the resultant variable, modifiable PSDC output signals conveyed by the indirect dorsal column pathway combine with unmodified LTMR signals carried by the direct dorsal column pathway to shape the brain’s representations of myriad features of the physical world.
Here, we investigated how DH neurons encode tactile features using mechanical stimuli and anesthetized mice. Future studies should address DH neuron response profiles, and the contributions of FFI and PSI inhibitory circuit motifs, during naturalistic behaviors in awake mice. Also, though we defined a role for Rorβ neurons in sensory-evoked FFI onto PSDC projection neurons, additional DH inhibitory interneurons mediate FFI onto other DH neuron types. Future studies should test the contributions of the range of inhibitory and excitatory interneuron types that underlie FFI, PSI, and feedforward excitation, preferably using next generation genetic tools and acute perturbations in awake, behaving mice.

Tamoxifen was dissolved in ethanol (20 mg/ml), mixed with an equal volume of sunflower seed oil (Sigma), vortexed for 5–10 min and centrifuged under vacuum for 30 min for ethanol removal. The solution was kept at −80°C and delivered via oral gavage to pregnant females for embryonic treatment (E10.5-E12.5, as specified in Table S1 ), or via intraperitoneal injection for postnatal treatment (P15–P25, as specified above). For spinal cord interneurons, time-points were chosen to label adult interneuron populations with defined anatomical and physiological signatures. 20 20.

Adult (>6 weeks) animals were administered dexamethasone (2 mg/kg IP) 1–2 h prior to recording to prevent tissue swelling, and were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, Sigma). During surgery, isoflurane (1%) was administered but removed prior MEA recordings, and surgical plane of anesthesia was confirmed throughout the recording. The temperature of the animal was monitored and maintained (TC-344B, Warner Instruments) between 35 and 37.5°C using a thermoelectric heater (C3200-6145, Honeywell) embedded in castable cement (Aremco). The hair surrounding the dorsal hump was shaved; a skin incision was made over the spinal segments T13 to L6, and the surrounding tissue was removed exposing the spinal column. An incision was made between vertebrae and tendons to allow for spinal clamp placement. The vertebrae above the recording site were stabilized using custom clamps to prevent movement. All tissue was cleared from vertebra and intervertebral space with forceps and spring scissors. The vertebrae between L4 and L5, were retracted to expose the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, the dura was removed and the surface of the cord bathed in mineral oil/submerged in saline solution. A 32-channel silicon probe (Neuronexus A1x32-Poly3-5mm-25s-177-A32 or Cambridge Neurotech ASSY-37H4 optrode) was inserted into the hindlimb representation region of the dorsal horn (medial L4–L5 spinal levels) and advanced up to ∼700 μm below the dorsal surface under visual guidance. Once positioned in a region where firing in many units could be evoked by brushing the hindpaw, the MEA was kept in place for 20 min to ensure a stable recording. Signals were amplified, filtered (0.1 – 7.5 kHz bandpass), and digitized (20 kHz) using a headstage amplifier and recording controller (Intan Technologies RHD2132 and Recording Controller). Data acquisition was controlled with open-source software (Intan Technologies Recording Controller version 2.07).
The hindpaw was stabilized with the plantar surface facing upwards, and stroking of the glabrous hindpaw was used as search stimulus to confirm probe placement. If cutaneous receptive fields were not on the glabrous hindpaw the probe was removed and reinserted in a new location. A 150–200 μm diameter Teflon-tipped indenter was controlled by a dual-mode force controller (Aurora Scientific 300C-I) and used to stimulate the glabrous hindpaw. For mapping receptive field (RF) areas, the position of the indenter was controlled with two linear translation piezo stages and a stage controller (Physik Instrumente U-521.24 and C-867.2U2). The position, force, and displacement of the indenter were commanded with custom-written MATLAB scripts controlling a Nidaq board (National Instruments, NI USB 6259). Force steps were applied atop the minimum force required to keep the indenting probe in contact with the skin.
In a subset of experiments, electrodes were coated with DiI (Thermo Fisher) after the recording was completed, reinserted in the spinal cord to the same coordinates and allowed to stabilize for 10–20 min. Animals were then anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA for post hoc identification of the electrode track.
To record from genetically defined DH interneuron populations, we used an optical tagging strategy in mice expressing excitatory opsins in specific DH neuron types (as specified in figure legends). We identified optotagged units by delivering 1–20 ms pulses of blue light (4–10 mW/mm 2 at fiber tip) to the surface of the spinal cord through optical fibers (200 μm core diameter; NA = 0.66) attached to Cambridge Neurotech ASSY-37H4 optrodes. Light was delivered from a 470 nm LED (M470F3, Thorlabs) or a 150 mW, 488 nm fiber coupled laser (OBIS LX #SKU 1220124, Coherent). Because most dorsal horn interneurons are glutamatergic, at the end of each experiment we applied ∼25–50μL NBQX (5 mM, Tocris, dissolved in H 2 O) to the surface of the cord to block recurrent excitation. Efficient block of glutamatergic synaptic transmission was determined by testing whether DH neuronal responses to brush stimulation or indentation were abolished, typically 10–20 min following NBQX application. Neurons that responded to optical stimulation both before and after NBQX application were considered optotagged. A modified stimulus-associated spike latency test (SALT; ref. 15 15.

Distinct behavioural and network correlates of two interneuron types in prefrontal cortex Nature. 2013; 498 :363-366 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ) was additionally used to confirm short light-evoked spike latencies (<5 ms) and low first spike jitter in optotagged units. We also verified the validity of optotagging by comparing the average peak-aligned sensory-evoked waveform with average light evoked waveform using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r > 0.9).
In some experiments PSDC neurons were identified through antidromic activation of their dorsal column axons at cervical levels C1/C2. A laminectomy was performed to expose cervical spinal cord prior to lumbar dorsal horn recordings, and the region was sealed off with mineral oil.
After measuring tactile responses, a bipolar electrode (platinum-irridium 250 μm spacing, FHC) was placed on the surface of the dorsal column at cervical levels C1-C2. Single stimuli were applied at 0.1 Hz frequency while evoked spikes were monitored in the lumbar spinal cord. This strategy activated both Aβ fiber axons and axons of PSDC neurons ascending via the dorsal column to the DCN. Therefore, evoked spikes could be measured in the majority of dorsal horn units that responded to low-threshold mechanical stimulation of the skin. To isolate antidromically activated PSDC units, ∼50 μL NBQX (5 mM, Tocris, dissolved in H 2 O) was applied to the surface of the cord to block excitatory synaptic transmission from dorsal horn Aβ fiber synapses. Efficient block of glutamatergic synaptic transmission was confirmed by testing whether DH neuronal responses to brush stimulation or indentation were abolished, typically 10–20 min following NBQX application. Units that responded to antidromic stimulation with reliable and precisely timed antidromic spikes (spike latencies and jitter <5 ms) in the presence of NBQX were considered PSDC units.
Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) MEA recordings were performed as described previously. 15 15. Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Panzeri, S. ... Cortical responses to touch reflect subcortical integration of LTMR signals Nature. 2021; 600 :680-685 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar Briefly, a craniotomy spanning hindpaw S1 was performed at least 24 h prior to the recording sessions (coordinates: 0.60 mm posterior and 1.65 mm lateral to bregma). For S1 MEA recordings of awake mice, a 32-channel silicon probe (Neuronexus A1x32-Poly2-5mm-50s-177-OA32) was inserted into hindpaw S1 and the tip of the probe was advanced to 1100 mm below the dura.
Shortly after the probe was inserted into the brain, we confirmed probe placement in hindpaw S1 by gently brushing the skin of the animal with a fine paintbrush while monitoring spikes from multiple channels. If RFs were not on the glabrous paw, the probe was removed from the brain, moved to a new location within the craniotomy, and reinserted. Otherwise, the paw was tethered over a circular aperture (7.6 mm diameter) in an acrylic platform that supported the animal. A 0.5 mm diameter, cylindrical, Teflon-tipped indenting probe was controlled by a dual-mode force controller (Aurora Scientific 300C-I) and was used to stimulate the paw through the aperture. The position, force, and displacement of the indenter were commanded with the same custom MATLAB (version 2017a) scripts controlling a Nidaq board (National Instruments, NI USB 6259) used for spinal cord recordings, described above. For indentation-evoked responses, regular spiking and fast spiking units were combined and sorted by depth ( Figures 7 H and 7I). For multiregional RF mapping, we gently brushed the entire body of the animal. Regions of the body that elicited an increase in spiking to brushing were documented and included in the overall RF map.

The L4 DRG was exposed via a dorsal incision and laminectomy. The exposed DRG was immersed in external solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 3.1 KCl, 0.5 KH 2 PO 4 , 6 glucose, 1.2 CaCl 2, 1.2 MgSO 4 (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) and the same solution was used to fill glass pipettes with a 20–30 μm tip diameter. Extracellular action potentials were measured using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments) operating in the voltage clamp configuration. The pipette voltage was set so that no current was flowing through the amplifier at baseline. The data was digitized at 40 kHz with a Digidata 1550a (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at 10 kHz (four-pole Bessel filter), and acquired using pClamp (Molecular Devices, Version 10). For MEA recordings, MEAs were inserted into the L4 DRG (Cambridge Neurotech ASSY-37H4). MEA signals were high-pass filtered at 200 Hz, amplified (RHD2132) and acquired at 20kHz (RHD2000, Intantech) for offline processing.

Drift monitoring was performed during acquisition and experiments with detectable changes in spike waveforms were discarded. The voltage traces were filtered with a differentiation filter of order 3. Frequency outliers were removed with a threshold of 10 median absolute deviations (MADs). Action potentials were detected with a threshold of 4.5 times the SD of the noise. Action potentials with similar times across sites were merged and then sorted into clusters with a density-based-clustering algorithm 90 90. Rodriguez, A. ∙ Laio, A. Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks Science. 2014; 344 :1492-1496 Crossref Scopus (4043) PubMed Google Scholar (clustering by fast search and find of density peaks) with cutoffs for log 10 (r) at −3 and log 10 (d) at 0.6. Clusters with a waveform correlation greater than 0.99 were automatically merged. Outlier spikes (>6.5 MADs) were removed from each cluster.
To isolate putative single units, manual cluster curation was performed with JRCLUST split and merge tools. Clusters were classified as single units if (1) the waveforms were large with respect to baseline; (2) there was a clear refractory period in the cross-correlogram (interspike intervals >1 ms); (3) waveforms were clearly distinct from nearby clusters. Spikes event times for clusters classified as single units were exported and processed in Python. 78 78. Van Rossum, G. ∙ Drake, Jr., F.L. Python reference manual.

Automated unsupervised clustering was performed on DH single unit response profiles to 500 ms step indentations of increasing intensities from 1mN to 75mN. For dataset collection, step indentations were applied either across the entire hindpaw (N = 106 mice; see Receptive field mapping below), or at manually determined RF centers for the majority of units on the probe (N = 36 mice). Units with spiking below the first spiking percentile and units with no response threshold (for which only baseline firing was detected) were excluded from this analysis. The baseline firing rate was measured during the 1 s interval before each indentation trial, and analysis was performed after the baseline firing rate was subtracted from stimulus-evoked responses.
We first extracted a minority of DH units inhibited by step indentations (i.e., units with ON and early sustained responses below their baseline firing rate at 40–75 mN; n = 89). These neurons comprise the inhibitory functional cluster, cluster 6. We used principal component analysis (PCA) on the remaining dataset of 4971 units to extract features of indentation-evoked signals. The extracted features resembled classically defined temporal response profiles such as ON, OFF and sustained responses, with the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) resembling RA- and SA-LTMR responses respectively ( Figure S1 D). We then performed k-medoid clustering using the number of PCs that account for 90% of variance in the data (n = 503). Three different distance metrics (Euclidian, cosine and correlation distance) were tested, and cosine distance was chosen because this metric resulted in better cluster quality. To find the optimal number of clusters, silhouette values were calculated, and a local maximum determined (K = 5), with the addition of the inhibitory cluster, K = 6 for the complete dataset. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) with 10 ms time bins were generated to show the average response across all units within a functional cluster. PSTHs are shown in 10 ms in all figures, unless otherwise stated.
Response properties of DH units across the six principal functional response types were then computed based on raw spike counts. Step indentation were subdivided into 5 distinct time windows to monitor different aspects of neuronal responses. The ON response was defined as the firing rate evoked during the first 50 ms after the stimulus onset, Early Sustained response, as 50–200 ms following ON response; Late Sustained response, as 0–200 ms before stimulus offset; OFF response, as the first 50 ms after stimulus offset and after-discharge response as 50–200 ms after stimulus offset.
Thresholds for all units were determined by bootstrapping the baseline firing rate 1000 times to generate 95% confidence intervals, and detecting the smallest stimulus within the ON/OFF/Early Sustained or Late Sustained response windows that exceeded the upper bound or drops below the lower bound.
We quantified sensitivity and response magnitude by (1) quantifying the maximum Z scored firing rate within the 5 time intervals described above at all step indentations, and (2) by determining the fraction of units that responded to each force step ( Figure 4 , 5 , and S4 ). A unit was determined to be responsive if it produced | Z scored firing rate| ≥ 3 between 10 and 50 ms after the onset or offset of the step indentation, or | Z scored firing rate| ≥ 1 during the sustained portion of the step.
The amplitude of the ramp and hold indentation was 1 mm, and their overall duration was 10 s, with on and off and ramps lasting 25 ms and separated by a 500 ms interval. Indentations were presented for a minimum of 30 trials at a unit’s hotspot or at multiple locations across the paw.
In the glabrous skin conditional knockout mice ( Advillin Cre ; TrkB flox/flox and Advillin Cre ; TrkB flox/flox ; Atoh1 flox/flox ; Figure 4 and S4 ), step indentations were restricted to plantar pedal pads and digital pads to avoid small hairs in the center of the mouse hindpaw glabrous skin. 91 91.

To measure receptive fields, step indentations of increasing forces were applied twice to randomized locations across the hindpaw in a 6 × 6 mm grid with 500 μm spacing between each stimulation site. In some cases, grid spacing was modified, as specified in the figure legends. The average grid area was 36mm 2 Receptive field area was calculated at forces delivered at and above each unit’s response threshold. To compute receptive fields, we first centered on each grid location and pooled all adjacent sites in a 3 x 3 grid into a larger spatial bin. For each response type, we then computed the bootstrap mean response over all 3 x 3 sites for 1000 bootstrap samples to establish 95% confidence interval. If the lower/upper bound of the CI was greater/smaller than the mean baseline firing rate of that bin, an excitatory/inhibitory response was assigned to that center site. The excitatory/inhibitory receptive field size was then calculated as the fraction of sites that had an excitatory/inhibitory response multiplied by the probed area, whereas the RF fraction was simply the fraction of sites that had an excitatory/inhibitory response.
To measure responses at the receptive field hotspot, the average firing rate across all forces and all grid locations was computed, and grid locations with the largest responses (5% of the grid with the highest responsivity) were determined. The neuron’s hotspot was defined as the location on the skin that produced the highest firing rate when stimulated. 36 locations closest to the RF hotspot were selected, and responses across these sites were averaged, creating a PSTH, to represent responsivity at the hotspot. When response profile clustering was performed at the hotspot, only the data collected at hot spot grid locations was used.
To map receptive fields beyond glabrous hindpaw at locations where force-controlled step indentation delivery was not feasible, we used a hand-held brush head (5/0 Round Princeton Art & Brush Co., Blick) mounted to a strain gauge force sensor (MBL (BL341AH) 25 g Model MBL load cell, Sensotec-Honeywell) connected to an amplifier (DMD-465WB, Omega). Stroke was delivered for 60 s to a given body region with 5 s inter-trial intervals. Mean baseline subtracted firing rate was measured for each body region and used to compute a preference index in a subset of PSDC units. PSDC body region preference index was computed as (FR paw – FR thigh )/(FR paw + FR thigh ); (FR paw – FR trunk )/(FR paw + FR trunk ); (FR paw – FR tail )/(FR paw + FR tail ); related to Figure 7 .
Vibratory stimuli were delivered to manually determined receptive field hotspots at intensities ranging from 1 mN to 40 mN and at 10 frequencies (2 Hz–120 Hz). Frequency and amplitude of sinusoidal step vibrations, lasting 1 s, were presented in a randomized order, separated by 1.5 s interstimulus interval for a total of 250 trails. Units were determined to be vibrationally responsive if they fired action potentials at rates above baseline to at least two frequencies delivered at the 40 mN intensity. The threshold for frequency tuned units is the lowest force evoking responses above baseline to three consecutive sine waves at each frequency. Entrainment (phase-locking) was determined at intensities between 15 and 40 mN and at all frequencies. Entrained units responded with at least 0.5 spikes/cycle and displayed precise spike timing within a particular part of the sine wave. This was determined using a permutation test comparing actual spike times to randomized spike times.
Pulses of light were generated every 100 ms or 500 ms using a 300 mW, 445 nm laser (CST-H-445-300, Ultralasers, Inc.). A minimum of 5000 light pulses were directed to the paw through two galvanometer scan mirrors (GVS201, Thorlabs) and an F-lens (FTH100-1064, Thorlabs), which focused the light to a 30 mm diameter spot. The intensity was modulated by inserting neutral density filters into the light path between the laser and the scan mirrors. Pulses were 1 ms in duration and the location of each pulse was randomized but confined to a 20 × 20 mm area that included the glabrous hind paw skin region. The location and timing of the light pulses were controlled using voltage signals generated with MATLAB (2017b, Mathworks) and a National Instruments system (NI USB 6259). Z scored firing rate was calculated in 1 ms bins using the baseline mean and SD in the 10 ms preceding each laser pulse. Units were determined to be responsive to optical stimuli if the absolute value of the Z scored firing rate exceeded 2.58 (98% confidence interval) within 25 ms after the laser pulse for A-fiber activation, or within 200 ms for C-fiber activation.
Optical RFs for DH and DRG neurons were computed with 1 mm 2 spatial bins. Baseline-subtracted optically-evoked firing rate across these 1 mm 2 subregions was normalized to the maximum optically-evoked firing rate. Bins with responses >0.5 of the maximum-normalized response were included in the overall RF area for each unit (calculated as the sum of the binarized subregions). DRG optical RFs originated were analyzed from previously published recordings. 15 15. Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Panzeri, S. ...

Animals (P13–15 for slice physiology experiments; 4–6 weeks for in vivo electrophysiology; P21–P30 for histology) were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame. The head was tilted 30° forward. Puralube ointment was applied to the eyes. The hair over the neck and caudal scalp was removed using a clipper, and the skin was sanitized using betadine. An incision was made in the midline of the back skin at the cervical level to expose neck muscles and local anesthetic (0.5% lidocaine) was applied to the incision site. Neck muscles were removed to expose the brainstem. A small incision was made on the dura to expose the DCN. The following retrograde tracers were injected into the DCN using a glass pipette under visual guidance: Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV9- hSyn-CheRiff-TdT, titer 2.73 × 10 15 in 0.9% saline, Boston Children’s viral core; AAV2retro-hSyn-Chronos-GFP, titer 1.3 × 10 13 in 0.9% saline, Boston Children’s viral core), Rabies Virus (RabV-deltaG-GFP, titer 5.84 × 10 7 - 9.48 × 10 8 IU/mL, Boston Children’s viral core), or cholera toxin subunit B (CTB; 2 mg/mL in PBS, Invitrogen). Once penetrating the surface, a small volume (30–50 nL) of tracer was injected at multiple locations in the DCN (200–400 nL total volume). The pipette was then removed, and overlying muscle and skin was stitched together with sutures. Animals were administered analgesic (Buprenex SR, 0.1 mg/kg) and monitored post-operatively. At the appropriate time point (4 weeks following AAV injections or 3–7 days following CTB or RabV injections), mice were used for electrophysiology experiments or transcardially perfused for tissue harvest.
Mice were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane, and intracardially perfused with ice-cold oxygenated choline solution (ACSF) prior to spinal cord removal. The isolated spinal cord was embedded in low-melting agarose (Sigma Aldrich), and transverse slices (300 μm) with dorsal roots attached were prepared from lumbar levels (L3–L5) using a Leica vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT1200S). Spinal cord slices were prepared in ice-cold oxygenated choline solution containing (in mM): 92 Choline Chloride, 2.5 KCL, 1.2 NaH 2 PO 4 , 30 NaHCO 3 , 20 HEPES, 2.5 Glucose, 5 Sodium Ascorbate, 2 Thiourea, 3 Sodium Pyruvate, 10 MgSO 4 7H 2 O, 0.5mM CaCl 2 2H2O. Slices recovered at 34°C for 30 min in HEPES holding solution equilibrated with 95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 containing (in mM): 86 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH 2 PO 4 , 35 NaHCO 3 , 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 NaAscorbate, 2 Thio Urea, 3 Na Pyruvate, 1 MgSO 4 7H 2 O, 2 CaCl 2 (pH 7.3, osmolarity 305), and were held in the same HEPES solution at room temperature until use.
Spinal cord slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber at room temperature and continuously perfused with ACSF containing (in mM): 2.5 CaCl 2 , 1 NaH 2 PO 4 , 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgSO 4 7H 2 O, 26 NaHCO 3 , 25 dextrose, and 1.3 Na ascorbate, saturated with 95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 at a rate of ∼1-2 mL/min. Cells were visualized using infrared differential interference contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of retrogradely labeled PSDCs in laminae IV-V were obtained under visual guidance using a 40x objective. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained using an internal solution containing (in mM): 135 CsMeSO 3 , 4 ATP-Mg 2+ , 0.3 GTP-Na + , 1 EGTA, 3.3 QX-314(Cl − salt), 8 Na 2 -Phoshocreatine and 10 HEPES. Synaptic currents were evoked with electrical stimulation of dorsal roots using a suction electrode at Aβ fiber strength (≤25 mA, 20–100 μs 55 55. Torsney, C. ∙ MacDermott, A.B.

For isolation of sensory-evoked EPSCs and feedforward IPSCs, PSDC neurons were voltage-clamped alternatively at the reversal potential for synaptic inhibition (−70 mV) and excitation (0 mV). To activate ChR2 in acute slices, LED whole field illumination was used through a water immersion 40x objective. Aβ LTMR axon terminals were stimulated with brief pulses (1–5 ms) of blue light (473 nm, 5 mW). Optically-evoked IPSCs (oIPSCs) were blocked by inhibitory or excitatory transmission blockers as specified in the figure legends.
For plasticity experiments, sensory-evoked glutamatergic EPSCs in PSDCs were isolated using pharmacological antagonists of GABA A Rs and glycine receptors (10 μM bicuculline, 1 μM strychnine). High-frequency stimulation (HFS; two 1 s trains at 100 Hz, intertrain interval 20 s, at 1.5 times test current intensity) was delivered after a stable 10 min baseline.
Current-clamp recordings were obtained with an internal solution containing (in mM): 135 K-Gluconate, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl 2 , 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP. Input resistance and access resistance were monitored continuously throughout each experiment and cells were excluded from analysis if these values changed by more than 10% during the experiment or if the resting membrane potential was higher than 50 mV. Data were acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, a Digidata 1440A acquisition system, and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Sampling rate was 10 kHz, and data were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz. No correction for junction potential was applied.
Mice (P30–P35) were anesthetized with CO 2 and perfused with 5–10 mL modified Ames Media (Sigma) in 1x PBS, followed by 20–40 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at room temperature (RT). Vertebral columns (including spinal cords and dorsal root ganglia) were dissected and were post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C for 2–16 h. Lumbar spinal cord sagittal sections (100–150 μm) were cut on a vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT100S) and processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously. 18 18. Abraira, V. ∙ Ginty, D.

Three washes in high salt PBS (HS PBS) were conducted each lasting 10 min. The tissue was then incubated in primary antibodies in high salt PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (HS PBSt) for 48–72 h at 4°C. Primary antibodies used goat anti-mCherry (1:1000, AB0040, Sicgen), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, A-11122, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and mouse anti-gephyrin (1:1000; Synaptic Systems). The tissue was washed in HS PBSt, then incubated in a secondary antibody solution in HS PBSt overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies included species-specific Alexa Fluor 405, 488, 546, and 647 conjugated IgGs (Life Technologies). Tissue sections were then mounted on glass slides, coverslipped with Fluoromount Aqueous Mounting Medium (Sigma) and stored at 4°C.
Brains and vertebral columns, including spinal cords and dorsal root ganglia, were removed from perfused mice and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4 ° C overnight. Tissues were washed in 1× PBS for over 3 h, and brains and spinal cords were finely dissected out from the rest of the tissue. Brain and spinal cord tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4 ° C for 2 days, embedded in OCT (1437365, Fisher), frozen using dry ice and stored at −80 ° C. Coronal brain sections and transverse spinal cord sections (30–40 μm) were cryosectioned on a cryostat (Leica). Spinal cord sections were collected on glass slides (12-550-15, Fisher), and brain sections were collected on glass slides or in 1× PBS.

z stack images of spinal cord slices were taken on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using a 40X oil-immersion lens (Zeiss; Plan-Apochromat 40X/NA 1.40) and scanned at a z-separation of 0.5 μm. Images were taken in DH lamina IIiv-IV, which was defined as between the lamina IIiv border (marked by IB4 binding) and 250 μm below that border. Imaging parameters (laser power, gain/offset, averaging, dwell time, etc.) were consistent across animals.
For analysis, images were first pre-processed using ImageJ 79 79. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (42394) PubMed Google Scholar : using the channel of PSDC labeling, two masks were generated — one using a standardized threshold for signal in this channel and a second by expanding this first mask by 1 μm in all dimensions. These masks were then used to isolate pre- and postsynaptic labeling by multiplying these channels (using the Image Calculator function) with the expanded and non-expanded masks, respectively. Next, images were analyzed using the Cell Counter ImageJ plugin to determine the proportion of inhibitory reporter terminals that apposed a gephyrin-immunoreactive puncta. Puncta were counted as a function of location: cell body, proximal neurite (within the first 50 μm) or distal neurite (beyond the first 50 μm).
Detection of Piezo2, Nav1.8, CGRP, Mrgprd and NFH transcripts in lumbar DRG neurons was performed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, as previously described. 50 50.

The emergence of transcriptional identity in somatosensory neurons Nature. 2020; 577 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar Briefly, lumbar DRG ganglia were rapidly dissected from euthanized mice, frozen in dry-ice and stored at −80°C until further processing. DRGs were cryosectioned at a thickness of 20 μm and RNA was detected using RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The following probes were used: Mm Piezo2 exons 43–45 (Cat# 439971-C3), Nav1.8 (Cat#: 426011-C2), Calca (Cat#:420361), Mm-Mrgprd (Cat#: 417921), Mm-Nefh (Cat#: 443671-C2). Sections were mounted in FluoroMount-G (Fisher 0100-01) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using a 10x or 20x objective.
Detection of Rorβ and Slc32a1 transcripts in lumbar spinal cord neurons was performed as previously described. 34 34. Choi, S. ∙ Hachisuka, J. ∙ Brett, M.A. ... Parallel ascending spinal pathways for affective touch and pain Nature. 2020; 587 :258-263 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar Briefly, lumbar spinal cords were dissected, immediately embedded in OCT, and frozen in dry-ice. Spinal cord tissue was cryosectioned (20 μm) and mRNA was detected as described for lumbar DRGs. The RNA scope catalog probes were used to detect Rorβ (Cat#: 444271-C2) and Slc32a1 (Cat#: 319191) mRNA.
To assess the contribution of dorsal horn Rorβ neurons to somatosensory behaviors, three complementary intersectional inactivation strategies were used: (1) Rorβ CreER in conjunction with Cdx2-NSE-FlpO for restricted FlpO expression to the spinal cord and the dual recombinase tetanus toxin line RC:PFtox; (2) Rorβ CreER ; Vgat flox/flox and (3) Rorβ iCre ; Vgat flox/flox for selective block of GABA/glycine release from either adult (2) or inhibitory lineage Rorβ neurons (3) . The Rorß CreER driver line captures the adult Rorβ population, but is not 100% efficient. On the other hand, the Rorß iCre ; Vgat flox/flox intersectional approach excludes lineage-labeled excitatory Rorβ neurons in the spinal cord, as well Rorβ neurons in S1 known to be exclusively excitatory, and is more penetrant (as it recapitulates the locomotor hindlimb impairments reported in Rorβ −/− mice).
Tactile PPI was used as a measurement of hairy skin sensitivity, as described previously. 56 56. Orefice, L.L. ∙ Zimmerman, A.L. ∙ Chirila, A.M. ... Peripheral Mechanosensory Neuron Dysfunction Underlies Tactile and Behavioral Deficits in Mouse Models of ASDs Cell. 2016; 166 :299-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar Briefly, using a San Diego Instruments startle reflex system (SR-LAB Startle Response System), mice were tested in a cylindrical chamber within a soundproof chamber. For tactile PPI, a prepulse of an air puff was administered to the hairy skin of the back. The air puff was delivered at a constant intensity (0.9 PSI), at varying intervals before the startle pulse, ranging from 50 ms to 1 s. A tone pre-stimulus (ranging from 68 dB to 80 dB, for 20 ms), followed by startle tone stimulus (120 dB, 20 ms) version of the PPI assay (acoustic PPI) was done as a control. Acoustic PPI was done with background noise set at 65 dB, while tactile PPI had background noise at 75 dB to ensure the air puff prepulse could not be heard. Startle reflex was quantitated using an accelerometer measuring the amplitude of movement of the animal.
Texture NORT was used to measure texture discrimination in glabrous skin, as previously described. 56 56. Orefice, L.L. ∙ Zimmerman, A.L. ∙ Chirila, A.M. ... Peripheral Mechanosensory Neuron Dysfunction Underlies Tactile and Behavioral Deficits in Mouse Models of ASDs Cell. 2016; 166 :299-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar On day 1 and 2 of behavioral testing, animals were individually habituated to an empty testing chamber (40 × 40 × 40 cm) under dim lighting for 10 min. Following habituation, animals were tested on color/shape NORT (day 3) and texture NORT (day 4). During the learning phase, the animal explored the testing chamber, in which two identical objects spaced equidistant from each other and the chamber walls, for 10 min. The animal was returned to the home cage for a 5 min retention period, during which the chamber and objects were thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol and one of the objects was replaced with a novel object. After the 5 min period, the animal was returned to the chamber for the 10 min exploration of the testing phase. Both the learning and testing phases were video-recorded from above. Custom MATLAB scripts were used to track animal position in the chamber and calculate the amount of time the animal spent investigating the objects. For color/shape NORT, the objects were wooden blocks differing in shape and color. In texture NORT, the objects were plexiglass cubes (4 cm 3 ) that were visually identical but varied in texture (rough or smooth). Animals were whisker plucked three days before the start of habituation. The preference for the novel object was calculated based on the time exploring both objects.
To test the role of feedorward and presynaptic inhibition in a fine sensorimotor behavior, we used a Sunflower Seed Handling Assay, as described previously. 51 51. Neubarth, N.L. ∙ Emanuel, A.J. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Meissner corpuscles and their spatially intermingled afferents underlie gentle touch perception Science. 2020; 368 :eabb2751 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar To habituate animals, one week prior to testing one to two tablespoons of black oil sunflower seeds (Bio-Serv, S5137-1, Wagner’s, 76,025) were added to the floor of the animals’ home cage for five consecutive days. If animals did not recognize seeds as a food source, then a teaspoon of seeds were cracked before adding to the cage floor.
Habituation to the behavior chamber and handling began two days prior to sunflower seed testing. Animals were habituated to the behavior room environment and investigator handling by undergoing tail inking on habituation day 1. To ink the tail, each animal was gently lifted and placed on the cage wire food hopper facing away from the investigator. Firmly holding the tail midway from the tail base, a blue permanent soy ink marker was rolled across the tail forming parallel lines to indicate identifying ear notch numbers. Once inked animals were gently transferred back into the home cage to await test chamber habituation.
The test chamber was constructed of a black matte acrylic wall and three optically clear walls, 10 in (L) x 8 in (w) x 8 in (h), 0.25 in thick, centered on a white matte acrylic floor under diffuse warm white light (2700K). Three digital USB 2.0 CMOS video cameras mounted on camera sliders were positioned on each clear side of the test chambers. One additional overview camera was mount directly above the test chamber.
Two days prior to testing and during testing seeds were withheld from the home cage to encourage foraging and seed eating in the test chamber. Animals were not food restricted for this assay. On habituation day 1 and day 2, animals were removed from the home cage and placed in an empty test chamber resting on the white matte acrylic floor. Each animal was given 2–3 seeds while freely exploring the test chamber for 20 min. Following the exploration, animals were then returned to their home cages. Testing began on day 3. Animals were transferred from their home cage and placed in the test chamber and allowed to explore the chamber for 5 min. Following acclimation, 2–3 seeds were placed on the floor of the test chamber and seed eating activity was recorded. At the completion of the seed eating test animals were removed from the test chamber and returned to their home cage. Chambers were reset and cleaned with unscented soapy water, wiped down with ddH2O and dried. Animals that failed to eat seeds after 20 min were returned to their home cage and the test rescheduled. This schedule was repeated until each animal fully deshelled and consumed multiple seeds. Seeds that were partially deshelled/consumed or discarded were not counted.
Behaviors were measured by defined seed deshelling and eating actions: (i) Seed peeling and deshelling—the act of grasping and holding the sunflower seed between the forepaws, clamping the upper and lower incisors into the shell surface, and applying downward force (dip) that pushed the shell away from the head and teeth toward the floor. This action resulted in a systematic peeling of the shell to expose the seed kernel. Animals unable to maintain a firm grip on, or fully grasp, the shell would typically adapt by touching, tapping, resting and/or bracing the seed against the floor between the forepaws. Animals also “tucked” the shell against their abdomen, holding the shell between the forepaws, clamping their upper and lower incisors onto the shell surface pulling their heads backward away from the shell and forepaws to peel off sections of the shell exposing the seed kernel. (ii) Touch-taps—the act of touching and/or holding and/or bracing the seed shell between the forepaws and the floor during seed peeling. (iii) Dip—the act of holding the seed shell between forepaws, clamping shell between incisors, and applying downward force to peel off sections of shell. (iv) Rotate—the act of or ability to change and/or manipulate shell orientation within the forepaws. (v) Rocking—the act of grasping the shell between the forepaws with the shell firmly between incisors, using forepaws to “rock” the shell side to side between the incisors to bite into the shell to peel and expose the seed kernel.
Statistical tests were conducted using the SciPy stats module (Python 3.8.5) or GraphPad Prism. Both non-parametric tests and parametric tests were used, depending on data normality, for comparing two independent groups (Mann-Whitney U test or Student’s t test), and multiple groups (Kruskal-Wallis H test/one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA for multiple groups with multiple timepoints). All statistically tests performed are indicated in the figure legends or supplemental statistics table. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Additional details on sample sizes and statistical tests for each experiment can be found in the figure legends, main text, and the supplemental statistics Table S1 .
