Title: Activation and Signaling Mechanism Revealed by Cannabinoid Receptor-G i Complex Structures


Abstract: Summary

Human endocannabinoid systems modulate multiple physiological processes mainly through the activation of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Their high sequence similarity, low agonist selectivity, and lack of activation and G protein-coupling knowledge have hindered the development of therapeutic applications. Importantly, missing structural information has significantly held back the development of promising CB2-selective agonist drugs for treating inflammatory and neuropathic pain without the psychoactivity of CB1. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy structures of synthetic cannabinoid-bound CB2 and CB1 in complex with G i , as well as agonist-bound CB2 crystal structure. Of important scientific and therapeutic benefit, our results reveal a diverse activation and signaling mechanism, the structural basis of CB2-selective agonists design, and the unexpected interaction of cholesterol with CB1, suggestive of its endogenous allosteric modulating role.

Section: Introduction

Cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 serve as key components of the endocannabinoid system and are the principal targets of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC), a psychoactive chemical from Cannabis sativa with a wide range of therapeutic applications ( Lemberger, 1980 35. Lemberger, L. Potential therapeutic usefulness of marijuana Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20 :151-172 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). CB1 and CB2 play crucial roles in a variety of physiological processes, including appetite, pain sensation, memory, and immunomodulation ( Guzmán, 2003 24. Guzmán, M. Cannabinoids: potential anticancer agents Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3 :745-755 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). The two cannabinoid receptors share 44% total sequence identity and 68% sequence similarity in the transmembrane regions ( Munro et al., 1993 44. Munro, S. ∙ Thomas, K.L. ∙ Abu-Shaar, M. Molecular characterization of a peripheral receptor for cannabinoids Nature. 1993; 365 :61-65 Crossref Scopus (4378) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, they differ in their tissue distribution and exert distinct functions in endocannabinoid system, where CB1 and CB2 are expressed predominantly in the central nervous system and the immune system, respectively.
So far, several crystal structures of cannabinoid receptors have been determined, including antagonist-bound ( Hua et al., 2016; Shao et al., 2016 27. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Pu, M. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB1 Cell. 2016; 167 :750-762.14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Shao, Z. ∙ Yin, J. ∙ Chapman, K. ... High-resolution crystal structure of the human CB1 cannabinoid receptor Nature. 2016; 540 :602-606 Crossref Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ) and agonist-bound CB1 ( Hua et al., 2017 28. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Nikas, S.P. ... Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB 1 Nature. 2017; 547 :468-471 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as antagonist-bound CB2 structures ( Li et al., 2019 36. Li, X. ∙ Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2 Cell. 2019; 176 :459-467.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). While these structures have enhanced our understanding of the ligand induced inactive or active-like states, there are a number of important challenges that remain. First, the development of therapeutic applications has been hindered by difficulty in specifically modulating the individual cannabinoid receptors due to their high sequence similarity. Also, the absence of the agonist-bound CB2 structure has held back the development of CB2-selective agonists as high potential drug candidates for treating inflammatory and neuropathic pain without the psychoactivity of CB1 ( Contino et al., 2017; Lunn et al., 2008 12. Contino, M. ∙ Capparelli, E. ∙ Colabufo, N.A. ... Editorial: The CB2 Cannabinoid System: A New Strategy in Neurodegenerative Disorder and Neuroinflammation Front. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :196 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Lunn, C.A. ∙ Reich, E.P. ∙ Fine, J.S. ... Biology and therapeutic potential of cannabinoid CB2 receptor inverse agonists Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153 :226-239 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, CB2 and CB1 elicit their physiological responses by coupling primarily to G i/o proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP signaling, yet CB1 also couples with G s (G protein-stimulating adenylate cyclase) or G q/11 (G protein-activating phospholipase C and G protein-increasing cytosolic Ca 2+ ) to instigate signaling under special circumstances ( Glass and Felder, 1997; Lauckner et al., 2005 22. Glass, M. ∙ Felder, C.C. Concurrent stimulation of cannabinoid CB1 and dopamine D2 receptors augments cAMP accumulation in striatal neurons: evidence for a Gs linkage to the CB1 receptor J. Neurosci. 1997; 17 :5327-5333 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 34. Lauckner, J.E. ∙ Hille, B. ∙ Mackie, K. The cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 increases intracellular calcium via CB1 receptor coupling to Gq/11 G proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :19144-19149 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although an indole-based synthetic cannabinoid MDMB-Fubinaca (FUB)-bound CB1-G i structure was determined recently ( Krishna Kumar et al., 2019 33. Krishna Kumar, K. ∙ Shalev-Benami, M. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of a Signaling Cannabinoid Receptor 1-G Protein Complex Cell. 2019; 176 :448-458.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ), the activation and G protein-coupling mechanism underlying the two cannabinoid receptors CB2 and CB1 is still elusive.
Here, we have used single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and obtained the structures of agonist-bound CB2 and CB1 in complex with the heterotrimeric protein G i as well as the crystal structure of agonist-bound CB2 by X-ray crystallography method. Together with our previously reported crystal structures of CB1 and CB2, we have, so far, determined structures of CB1 and CB2 in their inactive, active-like, and active states. Comparing the six cannabinoid receptor structures together with several other solved G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures in complex with G i/o , G s , or G 11 proteins, this study provides comprehensive insights into the diverse activation and means by which cannabinoid receptors couple to G proteins and opens up avenues for the rational design of new selective ligands, especially agonists, to precisely modulate the endocannabinoid systems.

Section: Results

To prepare the stable CB2-G i (Gα i βγ) complexes for cryo-EM studies, we tried different modifications and ligands. Eventually, the expression level of CB2 receptor was improved by the insertion of BRIL protein at CB2’s N terminus. The stability of the CB2-G i complex was achieved by co-expression of the receptor with the heterotrimeric G i protein and the designed high-affinity ( K i = 0.37 nM for CB2) agonist AM12033 ( Figure S1 ). The CB2-G i complex was further stabilized by the addition of scFv16 ( Koehl et al., 2018 32. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the μ-opioid receptor-G i protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of the frozen sample enabled us to obtain nominal global maps at 2.9 Å resolution for CB2-AM12033-G i -scFv16 ( Figure 1 ; Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). The ligand, receptor, and G i in the isolated complex are clearly visible in the EM maps ( Figure S2 ). Side chains of the majority of amino acid residues are well defined in all protein components ( Figures S2 C and S2D). Thus, the structure provides an accurate model of intermolecular interactions of CB2 with the agonist and G i .
The same method was applied in obtaining the CB1-AM841-Gi-scFv16 complex cryo-EM structure at 3.0 Å resolution and the only differences is that the CB1-G i complex was constituted in vitro from purified protein components using the THC-like cannabinoid agonist AM841( Hua et al., 2017 28. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Nikas, S.P. ... Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB 1 Nature. 2017; 547 :468-471 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ) instead of in vivo co-expression for CB2-Gi complex. In addition, the agonist AM12033-bound CB2 crystal structure was also determined at 3.2 Å resolution ( Table S2 ).
The overall structure of the active CB2-G i complex is similar to that of the active conformation of the CB1-G i complex ( Figure 2 A), with root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 1.65 Å for the whole complex, 1.26 Å for the receptors alone, and 0.41 Å for the G i proteins. The N termini of both receptors adopt identical conformations, forming a short helix over the binding pocket. The binding poses of AM12033 in CB2 and AM841 in CB1 are superimposable. When comparing inactive and active states of CB2, we observe an outward movement of TM6 that is characteristic of receptor activation and an extension of TM5 that resulted in new interactions with Gα i ( Figure 2 B). Similar conformational changes are also observed in CB1-G i complex structure ( Figures S3 A and S3B). These structural changes allow the G protein to engage with the receptor core. In addition, the conformations of critical residues for the receptor activation, such as D 3.49 R 3.50 Y 3.51 and N 7.49 P 7.50 xxY 7.53 motifs (superscripts indicate Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering for GPCRs [ Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995 3. Ballesteros, J.A. ∙ Weinstein, H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models and computational probing of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors Methods in Neurosciences. 1995; 25 :366-428 Crossref Scopus (2687) Google Scholar ]), are almost identical between the active conformations of CB2 and CB1 ( Figures S3 C and S3D). Different from the large conformational changes of both extracellular and intracellular domains occurring from inactive to active states in CB1 ( Figure S3 B), the extracellular region, including the N terminus of CB2, undergoes very minor changes during its activation ( Figures 2 C and 2D).
The overall structure of the G i heterotrimers in CB2 and CB1 complex structures is similar to those previously solved GPCR-G i complexes ( Figure S4 ). No electron density for guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is observed in the GDP-binding pocket, which is mainly formed by the β1-α1 loop (P loop) and the β6-α5 loop, suggesting that G i is nucleotide-free in both receptor-G i complex structures. The antibody scFv16 binds at a similar interface comprising of the αN helix of Gα i and the β-propeller of Gβ, as previously reported ( Koehl et al., 2018 32. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the μ-opioid receptor-G i protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The structure of the CB2-G i complex reveals a similar mode of interaction when compared with the CB1-G i complex. The contacts between CB2 and G i are extensively mediated through the G αi subunit. The primary interaction interface is composed of TM3, TM5, TM6, and ICL2 of the receptor and the α5 helix, αN helix, and αN-β1 loop of the Gα i subunit ( Figure 3 A). Similar to other G i -bound GPCRs, the two large hydrophobic side chains L353 and L348 of the α5 helix from Gα i are directed toward the hydrophobic pocket. For example, the hydrophobic pocket is formed by Val212 5.61 , Leu243 6.33 , Leu247 6.37 , Leu239 6.29 , and Leu135 3.54 from the cytosolic ends of TM5, TM6, and TM3 of receptor ( Figure 3 B). However, compared to the μOR-, A1-, 5HT1B-, and M2-G i complexes ( Draper-Joyce et al., 2018; García-Nafría et al., 2018; Koehl et al., 2018; Maeda et al., 2019 15.

Cryo-EM structure of the serotonin 5-HT 1B receptor coupled to heterotrimeric G o Nature. 2018; 558 :620-623 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the μ-opioid receptor-G i protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Maeda, S. ∙ Qu, Q. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes Science. 2019; 364 :552-557 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ), the G i proteins in CB2- and CB1-G i complexes are observed to have a ∼20° anticlockwise rotation (if viewed from intracellular to extracellular direction) when aligning all available receptor-G protein complex structures using CB2 structure as reference ( Figures S4 A and S4B). The orientation difference of the G i proteins from CB2 and CB1 complexes may be attributed to the more extended TM5 of CB2 or CB1 where additional interactions with the α5 helix of Gα i are observed ( Figure 3 B). Specifically, residues Ser222 5.71 and His226 5.75 from CB2 or R311 5.75 from CB1 formed new interactions with D337 and Q333 in α5 helix of Gα i . We hypothesize that the extra pulling force may serve to twist G i into a more energy-favorable orientation in the CB2- and CB1-G i complexes.
While CB1 and CB2 signal through G i , CB1 is also known to couple with G s or G q . After careful inspection of the residues that are involved in the receptor-G i interactions, L222 ICL2 in CB1 is found in the proximity of L194 in the β2-β3 loop, as well as I344 in α5 helix of Gα i , which established weak interactions between CB1 and G i ( Figure 3 C). In contrast, equivalent residue to L222 ICL2 in CB2 is P139 ICL2 , which is unique in class A GPCRs and not involved in the interaction with G i ( Figure 3 C). Previous studies have shown that the P139 ICL2 mutation of P139F, P139M, or P139L enabled CB2 to couple with G s protein ( Zheng et al., 2013 64. Zheng, C. ∙ Chen, L. ∙ Chen, X. ... The second intracellular loop of the human cannabinoid CB2 receptor governs G protein coupling in coordination with the carboxyl terminal domain PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e63262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the L222 ICL2 (CB1) equivalent residue F139 ICL2 in the β 2 AR-G s structure forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with a pocket consisting of α5 helix, β2-β3 loop, and β1 strand in Gα s ( Figures S4 E and S4F) ( Maeda et al., 2019 39. Maeda, S. ∙ Qu, Q. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes Science. 2019; 364 :552-557 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement, L222F mutation in CB1 has been shown to increase CB1-G s basal activity ( Chen et al., 2010b; Krishna Kumar et al., 2019 10. Chen, X.P. ∙ Yang, W. ∙ Fan, Y. ... Structural determinants in the second intracellular loop of the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor mediate selective coupling to G(s) and G(i) Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 161 :1817-1834 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Krishna Kumar, K. ∙ Shalev-Benami, M. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of a Signaling Cannabinoid Receptor 1-G Protein Complex Cell. 2019; 176 :448-458.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we speculate that the residue L222 ICL2 in CB1 facilitates its coupling with G s , and likely G q as well.
Concerning the interactions between ICL1, helix8 from CB2 and Gα i , we identified that Ser69 and Tyr70 in ICL1 form polar interactions with D305 in Gα i , which constrain the conformation of ICL1. In addition, ICL1 and helix8 of CB2 are in close proximity to the G β subunit, and the presence of multiple polar and charged amino acids at this interface suggests potential interactions.
In the CB2-G i complex, the agonist AM12033 adopts an L-shape conformation in the orthosteric binding pocket. The interactions between AM12033 and CB2 are mainly hydrophobic and aromatic, including residues from ECL2, TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 ( Figure 4 ). The tricyclic tetrahydrocannabinol system of AM12033 forms π-π interactions with Phe183 ECL2 , Phe281 7.35 and Phe94 2.64 , and the phenolic hydroxyl at C1 forms a hydrogen bond with Ser285 7.39 . The alkyl chain of AM12033 extends into the long channel and forms hydrophobic interactions with residues from TM3, TM5, and TM6. Prior to solving cryo-EM CB2-G i complex structure, we have already determined the AM12033-bound CB2 crystal structure at 3.2 Å resolution ( Figure 4 A) where the binding pose of AM12033 can be unambiguously defined, owing to the clear electron density in the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket. The competitive binding of AM12033 is in agreement with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) functional assay ( Figures S3 E and S3F). The agonist AM12033 in both cryo-EM and crystal structures shares almost identical binding poses, and the surrounding residues take similar conformations as well ( Figure S5 A). Notably, the binding pockets of agonist AM12033 and antagonist AM10257 in CB2 share a high degree of similarity, as speculated in our previous report ( Li et al., 2019 36. Li, X. ∙ Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2 Cell. 2019; 176 :459-467.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 C), while the inward movements of extracellular parts of TM1, TM4, and TM7 produce a more compact agonist-binding pocket in CB2.
In the AM12033-G i -bound CB2 structure, the side chain of “toggle switch” residue Trp258 6.48 experiences an expected major conformational change ( Figure 4 D) and a large outward movement of the intracellular part of TM6 by 11 Å (Arg238 as reference) to accommodate the mounting of α5 from the Gα i protein ( Figure 5 A). Moreover, the cytoplasmic portion of TM5 extended and moved outward by about 6 Å (V220 as reference) to form extensive interactions with the α5 of the Gα i , as discussed above. However, the cytoplasmic region of TM5 in CB1 is simply extended during activation ( Figure 5 B). The larger movement of TM5 in CB2 may be attributed to Gly210 5.59 (Met295 5.59 in CB1) that provides extra bending flexibility of TM5 ( Figure 5 C). Additionally, the classical activation features in class A GPCRs are also observed here, including the rearrangement of “microswitches” DRY and NPxxY motifs ( Figures S3 C and S3D) ( Erlandson et al., 2018 17. Erlandson, S.C. ∙ McMahon, C. ∙ Kruse, A.C. Structural Basis for G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2018; Published online March 2, 2018 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). The “ionic lock” between Arg131 3.50 and Asp240 6.30 , which is important for maintaining the ground state of the receptor ( Savinainen et al., 2003 54. Savinainen, J.R. ∙ Saario, S.M. ∙ Niemi, R. ... An optimized approach to study endocannabinoid signaling: evidence against constitutive activity of rat brain adenosine A1 and cannabinoid CB1 receptors Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140 :1451-1459 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ), is broken, and Arg131 3.50 in the DRY motif extends toward TM7 and forms a hydrogen bond with G352 from the α5-helix of G αi . A 4 Å inward displacement of the NPxxY motif (N295 7.49 , P296 7.50 , and Y299 7.52 ) in TM7 induces the conformational change of helix 8 and ICL1, eventually leading to the closer interaction between the receptor and G i .
The overall structure of AM841-CB1-G i is similar to our previously solved AM841-bound CB1 crystal structure ( Hua et al., 2017 28. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Nikas, S.P. ... Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB 1 Nature. 2017; 547 :468-471 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). The main differences occur in the CB1-G protein interface where the interacting residues are stabilized by G i . In addition, elongation of TM5 and inward movement of TM5, TM6, ICL1, and ICL2 in the intracellular region resulted in more polar and hydrophobic interactions with α5 of the Gα i protein ( Figure S5 D). The binding poses of AM841 in the two structures are almost indistinguishable in the orthosteric binding pocket along with the key interacting residues. The “twin toggle switch” residues Phe200 3.36 and Trp356 6.48 adopt similar conformation in the two structures ( Figure S5 E), confirming their important role in CB1 activation. The DRY and NPxxY motifs show similar rearrangements ( Figure S5 F), indicating that the AM841-bound CB1 crystal structure is close to the active state. In contrast to the agonist-bound CB1 structures, the intracellular regions of TM5, TM6, and TM7 adopt a more converged conformation in AM12033-bound CB2 crystal structure, and its overall C α RMSD with antagonist AM10257-bound CB2 is only 0.86 Å ( Figure S5 C), compared with CB2-G i complex structure ( Figure S5 B). In our previous study, we have shown that class A GPCRs exhibit very diverse conformational changes in the intracellular region in responding to agonist binding ( Hua et al., 2017 28. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Nikas, S.P. ... Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB 1 Nature. 2017; 547 :468-471 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). CB2 behaves as most solved class A GPCRs, which only experience minor conformational changes upon agonist binding, while CB1 is exceptional and displays larger conformational changes when modulated by agonists.
The structures (inactive, agonist-bound, and active states) of CB2 and CB1 we have obtained so far reveal intriguing conformational diversities ( Figures 5 A and 5B) and provide us the structural basis for deciphering the activation and signaling mechanism of cannabinoid receptors. First, the balloon-like plasticity of CB1 during the transitions between different states facilitates its inherent ability to respond to a diverse array of ligands compared to CB2. More interestingly, the two closely related receptors experience quite different activation processes. The more complicated activation of CB1 assumes the synergistic conformational change of the “twin toggle switch,” Phe3.36 and Trp6.48, to unleash the large conformational changes and induce the G protein-coupling. Yet in CB2, the single “toggle switch,” Trp6.48, is enough to trigger the activation and the downstream signaling.
Additionally, there is an atypical polar amino acid residue (Thr3.46) in both CB2 and CB1 compared with a conserved non-polar (I/L/M/V) residue in most (95%) class A GPCRs. Previous studies ( D’Antona et al., 2006 13. D’Antona, A.M. ∙ Ahn, K.H. ∙ Kendall, D.A. Mutations of CB1 T210 produce active and inactive receptor forms: correlations with ligand affinity, receptor stability, and cellular localization Biochemistry. 2006; 45 :5606-5617 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our own data ( Hua et al., 2017 28. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Nikas, S.P. ... Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB 1 Nature. 2017; 547 :468-471 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that T3.46A mutation disables CB2 or CB1 in coupling G i protein. Based on our receptor-G i complex structures, we found that upon activation in both CB2 or CB1, Tyr7.53 establishes new contacts with Thr3.46, Leu3.43, and Arg3.50 ( Figures S5 G and S5H). Meanwhile, Asp6.30 in TM6 interrupts its salt-bridge interaction with Arg3.50 ( Figure S3 D). This strengthens the interaction of TM3 and TM7, weakens the constraint on TM6 from TM3, and unlocks the outward movement of TM6. Therefore, T3.46A mutation in cannabinoid receptors or some other class A GPCRs may lead to restriction of the movement of TM6 and inactivation of the receptor.
Furthermore, previous studies have shown that a contact between residues 2.42 and 3.46 is important for GPCR folding ( Venkatakrishnan et al., 2013 60. Venkatakrishnan, A.J. ∙ Deupi, X. ∙ Lebon, G. ... Molecular signatures of G-protein-coupled receptors Nature. 2013; 494 :185-194 Crossref Scopus (1189) PubMed Google Scholar ). In CB2, the side chain of Phe72 2.42 adopts similar rotamer conformations in all three states, and the contacts between TM2 and TM3 are maintained. However, in CB1, the side chain of Phe155 2.42 adopts different conformations in the three states, which facilitate the conformational flexibility of ICL1 and the cytoplastic end of TM2. This feature may indicate that these regions in CB1 may potentially be allosteric modulation sites. Of note, the cholesterol that we observed in the agonists-bound (AM11542 and AM841) CB1 crystal structures disappeared in the CB1-G i complex structure. Comparing with the cholesterol-binding pocket in agonist AM841 or AM11542 bound structures, the side chains of Phe155 2.42 and Phe237 4.46 undergo large conformational changes in CB1-G i structure and occupy the same position that cholesterol had in the agonist-bound crystal structures ( Figure 5 D). Also, the key residues involved in cholesterol binding are not conserved in CB1 and CB2. To our knowledge, Phe4.46 is unique to CB1 in class A GPCRs, and the cholesterol is not observed in either state of CB2 complex structures.
The structures we obtained so far reveal the similarity and diversity of antagonist- and agonist-binding modes in CB1 and CB2. The antagonist-binding pockets in both receptors are quite distinct, which is consistent with their high degree of antagonist selectivity ( Hua et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019 27. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Pu, M. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB1 Cell. 2016; 167 :750-762.14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Li, X. ∙ Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2 Cell. 2019; 176 :459-467.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the agonist-binding pockets in CB1 and CB2 and even the side-chain rotamers of the key residues involved with ligands interactions are almost identical ( Figure 6 A). Such structural observations may explain the low level of CB1 and CB2 selectivity found in the classical cannabinoids and their synthetic analogs.
In this study, to further explore the structural basis of agonist selectivity in CB1 and CB2, two highly CB2-selective agonists, HU-308 and L-759,656, were chosen as model ligands to probe the problems. The binding affinity of HU-308 for CB2 ( K i is 22.7 nM) is about 5,000 times higher than that of CB1 (almost no measurable K i ) ( Hanus et al., 1999 25. Hanus, L. ∙ Breuer, A. ∙ Tchilibon, S. ... HU-308: a specific agonist for CB(2), a peripheral cannabinoid receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :14228-14233 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ), while L-759,656 shows a binding affinity more than 406 times higher on CB2 ( K i is 11.8 nM) than that of CB1 ( K i is 4.8 μM) ( Ross et al., 1999 51. Ross, R.A. ∙ Brockie, H.C. ∙ Stevenson, L.A. ... Agonist-inverse agonist characterization at CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors of L759633, L759656, and AM630 Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126 :665-672 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ligand binding to a target protein is a dynamic process which involves synergetic conformational changes of both protein and ligand. Thus, we decided to employ the molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and meta dynamics (metaMD) simulations to study the ligand-binding process into CB1 and CB2 structures ( Figures 6 B, 6C, S5 I, and S5J) ( Barducci et al., 2011, 2008 4. Barducci, A. ∙ Bussi, G. ∙ Parrinello, M. Well-tempered metadynamics: a smoothly converging and tunable free-energy method Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008; 100 :020603 Crossref Scopus (2108) PubMed Google Scholar 5. Barducci, A. ∙ Bonomi, M. ∙ Parrinello, M. Metadynamics WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci. 2011; 1 :826-843 Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar ). For quality-control purpose, the non-selective agonists AM841 and AM12033 were used as positive controls.
In order to characterize the different binding processes of HU-308, L-759,656 and AM841 in CB1 and CB2, we calculated the RMSDs of ligands (RMSD ligand ) and key residues which are involved with ligand binding (RMSD molecule ) during each simulation course. The calculation results are shown in Figures 6 D and 6E. The RMSD values represent the conformation fluctuations for ligands or key residues during the 2 μs simulation process. Thus, the smaller RMSD value denotes more stable ligand-receptor binding. Not surprisingly, the RMSD AM841 in both CB1 and CB2, RMSD CB1 , and RMSD CB2 all kept almost constant similar values ( Figures 6 D and 6E). These results indicate that our evaluation strategy is valid. Fortunately, the RMSD values for HU-308 or L-759,656 in CB1 are obviously larger than those of CB2. Similarly, the RMSD values for key residues in HU-308- or L-759,656-bound CB1 are clearly bigger than those of CB2 ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Therefore, the MD simulation results agree with the different ligand-binding affinities with CB1 and CB2.
To dig further into the understanding of the principle of agonist selectivity in CB1 and CB2, we introduced an advanced free energy sampling method, the well-tempered metaMD simulations ( Barducci et al., 2011, 2008 4. Barducci, A. ∙ Bussi, G. ∙ Parrinello, M. Well-tempered metadynamics: a smoothly converging and tunable free-energy method Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008; 100 :020603 Crossref Scopus (2108) PubMed Google Scholar 5. Barducci, A. ∙ Bonomi, M. ∙ Parrinello, M. Metadynamics WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci. 2011; 1 :826-843 Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar ), to sample ligand-binding paths. MetaMD is a reliable method and has been widely used for many rare biological event samplings ( Barducci et al., 2011; Bonomi et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2014 5. Barducci, A. ∙ Bonomi, M. ∙ Parrinello, M. Metadynamics WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci. 2011; 1 :826-843 Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar 6. Bonomi, M. ∙ Barducci, A. ∙ Parrinello, M. Reconstructing the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution from well-tempered metadynamics J. Comput. Chem. 2009; 30 :1615-1621 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Yuan, S. ∙ Filipek, S. ∙ Palczewski, K. ... Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors correlates with the formation of a continuous internal water pathway Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4733 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the N termini in both CB1 and CB2 cover the orthosteric sites, the ligand entry process may be influenced. Thus, we selected two collective variables for our simulations: distance between the mass center of a ligand and that of the binding pocket and distance between the mass center of N terminus and that of ECL2 loop.
In the case of HU-308, the binding processes are composed of three different stages in both CB1 and CB2 ( Figure 7 ). Initially, HU-308 fluctuated in the bulk environment at the extracellular region in the vicinity of position P1. At a certain stage, the N terminus overcame energy barriers and opened an empty space to accommodate initial ligand binding. The free energy surface (FES) plot indicated that the energy barriers were similar for CB1 and CB2, i.e., approximately 3.5 kcal/mol and 3.0 kcal/mol, respectively. However, when HU-308 diffused into a deeper space toward the orthosteric site, the energy barrier increased noticeably. It was about 10.5 kcal/mol for CB1, whereas it was about 5.0 kcal/mol for CB2 ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Such an obvious difference should explain why HU-308 is much more potent against CB2.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we compared and analyzed the structure snapshots of CB2 and CB1 in their inactive, active-like, and activated signaling states and deciphered their activation and signaling mechanism. Although the overall architecture is similar between CB2-AM12033-G i and CB1-AM841-G i , CB2 and CB1 exhibit distinct characters in terms of ligand and G protein selectivity and activation process. The single reside difference in ICL2 (L222 in CB1 and P139 in CB2) may contribute to the G protein-coupling diversity of cannabinoid receptors, where CB2 is specific to G i only while CB1 can couple with G i , G s , and G q . The high degree of structural similarity in the orthosteric binding pockets between agonist-bound CB2 and CB1 imposes substantial challenges for high-selective agonist design. The MD and metaMD simulation analysis on the selectivity of HU-308 and L-759,656 implied the possible connection between agonist selectivity and agonist entry path into CB2 or CB1.
The other interesting finding of this study is the cholesterol-binding behavior with CB1. Our collective experimental evidence encourages us to speculate that cholesterol or other steroids may be the endogenous allosteric modulator of CB1. This idea is supported by previous data which showed that pregnenolone, a derivative of cholesterol, acts as a CB1 allosteric modulator ( Vallée et al., 2014 59. Vallée, M. ∙ Vitiello, S. ∙ Bellocchio, L. ... Pregnenolone can protect the brain from cannabis intoxication Science. 2014; 343 :94-98 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). We believe that pregnenolone may also bind to the same cholesterol-binding region in CB1 owing to their similar structural scaffolds. In summary, our findings uncovered new clues in understanding the activation and signaling mechanism of cannabinoid receptors and will help the precise modulation of endocannabinoid systems for therapeutic benefit.

U2OS cells were selected by geneticin selection (500 mg/mL) in MEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 250 mg/mL hygromycin.
All reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals company, unless otherwise specified, and used without further purification. All anhydrous reactions were performed under a static argon atmosphere in flame-dried glassware using scrupulously dry solvents. Flash column chromatography employed silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh). All compounds were demonstrated to be homogeneous by analytical TLC on pre-coated silica gel TLC plates (Merck, 60 F 245 on glass, layer thickness 250 μm), and chromatograms were visualized by phosphomolybdic acid staining. Melting points were determined on a micro-melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer. Peak strength is indicated as br (broad), w (weak), and s (strong). NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 , unless otherwise stated, on a Bruker Ultra Shield 400 WB plus ( 1 H at 400 MHz, 13 C at 100 MHz) or on a Varian INOVA-500 ( 1 H at 500 MHz, 13 C at 125 MHz) spectrometers and chemical shifts are reported in units of δ relative to internal TMS. Multiplicities are indicated as br (broadened), s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), qt (quintet) or m (multiplet). Coupling constants ( J ) are reported in hertz (Hz). Low and high-resolution mass spectra were performed in School of Chemical Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Mass spectral data are reported in the form of m / z (intensity relative to base = 100). LC/MS analysis was performed by using a Waters MicroMass ZQ system [electrospray-ionization (ESI) with Waters-2525 binary gradient module coupled to a Photodiode Array Detector (Waters-2996) and ELS detector (Waters-2424) using a XTerra MS C18, 5 μm, 4.6 mm x 50 mm column and acetonitrile/water].

CB2-T4L construction and expression for crystallization were performed using the similar procedure as described before( Li et al., 2019 36. Li, X. ∙ Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2 Cell. 2019; 176 :459-467.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the construct has truncations of residues 1-20, 223-234 and 326-360; the T4L fusion protein was fused to the truncated third intracellular loop of the human CB2 gene. Six mutations (Gly78 2.48 Leu, Thr127 3.46 Ala, Thr153 4.45 Leu, Gly210 5.59 Ala, Arg242 6.32 Glu and Gly304 8.48 Glu) were introduced into the CB2-T4L gene for further modification. The optimized construct was cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector with the haemagglutinin (HA) signal sequence at the N terminus and a 10 × His-tag followed by a Flag-tag at the C terminus. The modified CB2–T4L protein was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda ( Sf 9) insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Sf 9 cells were infected at a cell density of 2-2.5 × 10 6 cells per ml with high-titer viral stock MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 5.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 48 h post-infection and stored at −80°C for future use.
Frozen cell pellets were thawed and lysed by repeated washing and centrifugation in the hypotonic buffer of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, and the high osmotic buffer of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.0 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, with EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Purified membranes were thawed at room temperature and incubated with 20 μM AM12033 and inhibitor cocktail at 4°C for 3 h. The membranes were further incubated with 1.0 mg/mL iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 1 h and were solubilized in the buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% (w/v) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG, Anatrace) and 0.15% (w/v) cholesterol hemisucinate (CHS, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C for 2.5-3 h. The supernatant was isolated by ultracentrifugation, and then incubated with TALON IMAC resin (Clontech) and 20 mM imidazole, at 4°C overnight. The resin was washed with 15 column volumes (CV) of washing buffer I containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) LMNG, 0.02% (w/v) CHS, 30 mM imidazole and 20 μM AM12033, and 10 CV of washing buffer II containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) LMNG, 0.006% (w/v) CHS, 50mM imidazole and 20 μM AM12033.

The purified receptor was then concentrated to 20 mg/mL for crystallization trials.
Crystallization was performed using the lipidic cubic phase (LCP) method as described before( Caffrey and Cherezov, 2009 7. Caffrey, M. ∙ Cherezov, V. Crystallizing membrane proteins using lipidic mesophases Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :706-731 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). The concentrated CB2 protein in complex with AM12033 was reconstituted into LCP by mixing with molten lipid (90% (w/v) monoolein and 10% (w/v) cholesterol at volume ratio of 2:3 using a syringe mixer. LCP crystallization trials were performed using an NT8-LCP crystallization robot (Formulatrix). 96-well sandwich plates were incubated and imaged at 20°C using an automated incubator/imager (RockImager, Formulatrix). Crystals grew in the condition of 100 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 25% PEG 400, 220 mM Sodium sulfate decahydrate, and reached a full size of 40 mm × 20 mm after 2 weeks. The crystals were harvested from the LCP matrix using micromounts (MiTeGen) and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Spring-8 beamline 41XU, using a Pilatus3 6M detector (X-ray wavelength 1.0000 Å).

Wild type human CB1 was subcloned into a modified mammalian expression pTT5 vector, which contains a haemagglutinin (HA) signal sequence, a FLAG tag and 10 × His tag, followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. In order to improve the protein expression, the construct was further modified by the truncations of the CB1 residues 1-70, and 426-472, and the BRIL (PDB: 1M6T , MW 10.9kDa) fusion protein was fused to the N terminus. Glu273 5.37 Lys, Thr283 5.47 Val and Arg340 6.32 Glu, which do not affect the G protein-coupling were introduced ( Hua et al., 2017 28. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Nikas, S.P. ...

Purified membranes were thawed at room temperature and then incubated with 25 μM AM841 in the presence of 1.0 mg/mL iodoacetamide (Sigma) and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4°C for 2 h. The membranes were then solubilized with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) LMNG, 0.2% (w/v) CHS at 4°C for 2.5-3 h. The supernatants were isolated by high-speed centrifugation, and then incubated with TALON IMAC resin and 20 mM imidazole, at 4°C overnight.

For CB1-G i -scFv16 complex, a total of 5577 movies were collected and subjected for motion correction using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 65. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters for each non-dose weighted micrography were estimated by Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 63. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles selection, 2D and 3D classifications were performed on a binned dataset with a pixel size of 2.08 Å using RELION 2.1.0 ( Scheres, 2012 55. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate CB1-G i -scFv16 complex template for automatic picking, around 2,186,340 particles were automatically picked with manual guidence and classified by 2D classification in RELION. After auto-picking in RELION, the low-quality images and false-positive particles were removed manually. About 1,385,539 particles were extracted for subsequent processing. We used the cryo-EM structure of CB1-FUB-G i complex (Electron Microscopy Data Bank code EMD-0339), low-pass-filtered to 60 Å, as the initial model for 3D classification in RELION. The model of the best class after 3D classification was used as the initial model for the final 3D classification and 3D auto-refinement. Further Baycsian polishing of these particles was performed in RELION3.0, followed by another round of auto-refinement, which generated a final 3.0 Å map determined by gold standard Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 criterion. Local resolution estimation was performed with the Bsoft package ( Heymann, 2001 26. Heymann, J.B. Bsoft: image and molecular processing in electron microscopy J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133 :156-169 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the two unfiltered half maps.
For CB2-G i -scFv16 complex, a total of 3894 images were collected. The dataset was subjected to motion correction, CTF estimation, autopicking, 2D classification and 3D classification in RELION 2.1.0. About 1,248,405 particles were extracted for further 3D processing. We used our cryo-EM structure of CB1-AM841-G i complex, low-pass-filtered to 60 Å, as the initial model for 3D classification in RELION. After auto-refinement and further Baycsian polishing applied to these particles in RELION3.0 improved the density map with nominal resolution of 2.9 Å. Local resolution estimation was also performed with the Bsoft package.
For CB1-G i -scFv16 complex, the cryo-EM structure of CB1-FUB-G i complex (PDB code 6N4B ) was used as the starting model for model building and refinement against the electron density map. For CB2-G i -scFv16 complex, the CB2-AM12033 crystal structure and G i protein in CB1 were used as the starting model. The model was docked into the EM density map using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 48. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by iterative manual adjustment and rebuilding in COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 16. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) and phenix.real_space_refine in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model statistics were validates using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010a 9. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11087) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural figures were prepared in Chimera and PyMOL ( https://pymol.org/2/ ). The final refinement statistics are provided in Table S1 . The extent of any model overfitting during refinement was measured by refining the final model against one of the half-maps and by comparing the resulting map versus model FSC curves with the two half-maps and full model.
The Schrodinger Suite 2018-4 (Schrӧdinger) was used to predict the ligand-binding poses for CB1 or CB2. The structures of the two receptors were processed by using the ‘Protein Preparation Wizard’ ( Sastry et al., 2013 53. Sastry, G.M. ∙ Adzhigirey, M. ∙ Day, T. ... Protein and ligand preparation: parameters, protocols, and influence on virtual screening enrichments J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2013; 27 :221-234 Crossref Scopus (3994) PubMed Google Scholar ) and converting of ligands from 2D to 3D structures was carried out using ‘LigPrep’ (Schrӧdinger). The ‘Glide’ SP was used in molecular docking ( Friesner et al., 2004; Friesner et al., 2006 19. Friesner, R.A. ∙ Banks, J.L. ∙ Murphy, R.B. ... Glide: a new approach for rapid, accurate docking and scoring. 1. Method and assessment of docking accuracy J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47 :1739-1749 Crossref Scopus (7380) PubMed Google Scholar 20. Friesner, R.A. ∙ Murphy, R.B. ∙ Repasky, M.P. ... Extra precision glide: docking and scoring incorporating a model of hydrophobic enclosure for protein-ligand complexes J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49 :6177-6196 Crossref Scopus (5204) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The CB1 and CB2 structures were isolated from their cryo-EM complex structures and Prime (Schrӧdinger) was used to add missing side chains, hydrogens and cap the termini of the receptors. The residues D163 2.50 , D213 3.49 in CB1, D80 2.50 , D130 3.49 in CB2 were manually protonated to simulate the protonation upon GPCR activation ( Ranganathan et al., 2014 49. Ranganathan, A. ∙ Dror, R.O. ∙ Carlsson, J. Insights into the role of Asp79(2.50) in β2 adrenergic receptor activation from molecular dynamics simulations Biochemistry. 2014; 53 :7283-7296 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then the processed CB1 or CB2 in complex with agonists (AM841, HU-308 or L-759,656) was embedded in a bilayer composed of 140 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipids using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder (23, 24). The orientation of CB1 or CB2 in the membrane is referenced to the CB1 structure (PDB: 5TGZ ) in the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) database (25). Each receptor-agonist-membrane system was solvated in a periodic 0.15 M NaCl TIP3P water box with a minimum water height of 20.0 Å on top and bottom of the system.
All simulations were performed on a GPU cluster using the CUDA version of PMEMD (Particle Mesh Ewald Molecular Dynamics) in Amber18 (AMBER 2018, University of California, San Francisco). The protein was modeled with the ff14SB protein force field (26), ligands with the GAFF2 force field (24) and lipids with the AMBER Lipid17 force field. The constructed system was first energy minimized for 10,000 steps, of which the first 5,000 steps were performed using the steepest descent method and the remaining 5,000 steps used the conjugate gradient method. Then the simulation system was heated from 0 to 100 K using Langevin dynamics with a constant box volume. Restraints were applied to protein, ligands, and lipids with a constant force of 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 . Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 310 K, where the periodic box was coupled accordingly using anisotropic Berendsen control in order to maintain the pressure at around 1 atm. These restraints were then removed from lipids and the system was equilibrated for another 10 ns at the constant pressure and temperature ensemble (NPT). Further equilibration was then carried out at 310 K with harmonic restraints applied to the protein starting at 5 kcal/mol/Å 2 and reduced in a stepwise fashion every 2 ns for 10 ns, followed by 0.1 kcal/mol/Å 2 restraints for 20 ns for a total of 30 ns of equilibration. Then 2 μs production simulations with no restraints were performed at 310 K and 1 bar in the NPT ensemble for each system. The Particle mesh Ewald (PME) method ( Darden et al., 1993 14. Darden, T. ∙ York, D. ∙ Pedersen, L. Particle mesh Ewald: An Nlog(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98 :10089-10092 Crossref Scopus (23943) Google Scholar ) was used to treat all electrostatic interactions beyond a cutoff of 9 Å. The SHAKE algorithm ( Ryckaert et al., 1977 52. Ryckaert, J.P.C. ∙ Ciccotti, G. ∙ Berendsen, H.J.C. Numerical integration of the cartesian equations of motion of a system with constrains: Molecular dynamics of n-alkanes J. Comp. Physiol. 1977; 23 :327-341 Crossref Scopus (18417) Google Scholar ) was used for recording the length of bonds involving hydrogen during the simulation with an integration time step of 2 fs.
Snapshots from each trajectory were saved every 40 ps during the production runs and these trajectories were used for analysis with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (27) and CPPTRAJ (28).
To investigate the ligand-binding processes and ligand selectivity, we introduced well-tempered metaMD simulations. We choose two collective variables for our simulations: (1) distance between the mass center of a ligand and that of the binding pocket; (2) distance between the mass center of N-terminal and that of ECL2 loop. All membrane systems were built in CHARMM-GUI ( Jo et al., 2008 30. Jo, S. ∙ Kim, T. ∙ Iyer, V.G. ... CHARMM-GUI: a web-based graphical user interface for CHARMM J. Comput. Chem. 2008; 29 :1859-1865 Crossref Scopus (4914) PubMed Google Scholar ), under Charmm36m force field ( Huang et al., 2017 29. Huang, J. ∙ Rauscher, S. ∙ Nawrocki, G. ... CHARMM36m: an improved force field for folded and intrinsically disordered proteins Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :71-73 Crossref Scopus (3480) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each system contains 132 POPC lipids, 14400 water molecules as well as 0.15 M NaCl.

Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was measured using the CISBIO® cAMP Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (HTRF) (FRET) HiRange assay kit according to the manufacturers protocol (Cisbio Assays, Bedford, MA). CHO-hCB2 cells were plated in low-volume 384-well plates (4000/well) using Opti-MEM supplemented with 1% FBS following suspension in 5mM EDTA/PBS. Cells were treated for 30 min with 25μM of phosphodiesterase inhibitor (RO-20-1724), 20μM forskolin, and test compounds. Compounds were dissolved and diluted in DMSO to a final concentration of 1%. Plates were developed by adding the cAMP-d2 antibody and the cryptate solution in lysis buffer for 60 min at room temperature. Fluorescent measures were acquired at 620/665 nm using a Perkin-Elmer EnVision plate reader (Weltham, MA) and FRET was calculated as the 665/620 ratio. In all experiments, 1% DMSO was used as the vehicle and the response was normalized to the percent of response produced by the full agonist CP55,940. Agonist and antagonist drug additions were made at the same time.
The determination of agonist potency and relative efficacy was determined by 3 parameter nonlinear regression with responses normalized to the E max produced by CP55,940 in each individual experiment (N = 7 individual assays performed in duplicate) to generate the % CP55,940 graphed in the figure. The determination of antagonist affinity was calculated using a modified version of Schild’s method of dose-ratio comparison. At concentrations higher than 10 nM, SR144528 caused a decrease in the baseline activity of the system. It was therefore necessary to include this effect when analyzing the antagonist-mediated shift in the agonist EC 50 . Specifically, the bottom of the curve was permitted to float freely and the x-value of each response curve was interpolated where 50% of the maximum response was achieved. The dose-ratio of these interpolated values was used to produce the linearization and estimates of antagonist affinity. All analyses were performed using Prism 8.1 (GraphPad).
Coordinates and structures factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank for CB2-AM12033 (PDB: 6KPC ), CB2-AM12033-G i -scFv16 (PDB: 6KPF ) and CB1-AM841-G i -scFv16 (PDB: 6KPG ).
