Title: A Thalamic Orphan Receptor Drives Variability in Short-Term Memory


Abstract: Summary

Working memory is a form of short-term memory that involves maintaining and updating task-relevant information toward goal-directed pursuits. Classical models posit persistent activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a primary neural correlate, but emerging views suggest additional mechanisms may exist. We screened ∼200 genetically diverse mice on a working memory task and identified a genetic locus on chromosome 5 that contributes to a substantial proportion (17%) of the phenotypic variance. Within the locus, we identified a gene encoding an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, Gpr12 , which is sufficient to drive substantial and bidirectional changes in working memory. Molecular, cellular, and imaging studies revealed that Gpr12 enables high thalamus-PFC synchrony to support memory maintenance and choice accuracy. These findings identify an orphan receptor as a potent modifier of short-term memory and supplement classical PFC-based models with an emerging thalamus-centric framework for the mechanistic understanding of working memory.

Section: Introduction

Humans use working memory pervasively from reading the newspaper to crossing a busy intersection. More precisely, working memory is (1) the ability to temporarily store task-relevant information from seconds to minutes in the absence of sensory input while (2) manipulating this information toward purposeful pursuits ( Goldman-Rakic, 1995 34. Goldman-Rakic, P.S. Cellular basis of working memory Neuron. 1995; 14 :477-485 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2015) PubMed Google Scholar ). This dual process of maintenance (e.g., remembering previous sentences in a newspaper) and manipulation (anticipating what may come next) requires high attentional and cognitive demand and has been linked to intellectual aptitude and higher-order executive functions ( Conway et al., 2003 20.

Deficits in working memory are particularly prominent in learning disability, aging, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia ( Baddeley, 2003 3.

Early lesion studies established a fundamental role for prefrontal cortex (PFC) in working memory ( Jacobsen, 1936 39. Jacobsen, C.

Such persistent firing, lasting seconds to minutes, has been enigmatic given that it far outlasts the millisecond-level operational time constant of individual neurons. Despite decades of study, we lack consensus on brain mechanisms that generate this persistent activity ( Baddeley, 2012 4. Baddeley, A. Working memory: theories, models, and controversies Annu. Rev.

Neurosci. 2017; 20 :987-996 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is also growing appreciation for mechanisms beyond persistent activity, especially to account for multi-item storage and robustness to interference ( Miller et al., 2018 53. Miller, E.K. ∙ Lundqvist, M. ∙ Bastos, A.M. Working Memory 2.0 Neuron. 2018; 100 :463-475 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, more complete models are required.
In the past, unbiased genetic mapping approaches were foundational in revealing basic molecular mechanisms that can link neurophysiology and behavior ( Dudai et al., 1976 27.

Despite their power, these pioneering gene mapping approaches in invertebrates were limited by (1) mapping resolution (making the mapping of single genes laborious) and (2) an inability to assess higher-order cognitive processes such as selective attention and working memory. Taking inspiration from these approaches, and to address apparent limitations, we here performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in genetically diverse mice using the Diversity Outbred (DO) resource. Each DO mouse represents a unique mosaic of the parental strains and has a high degree of heterozygosity. Together they provide an ideal platform for high-resolution genetic mapping ( Churchill et al., 2012 17. Churchill, G.A. ∙ Gatti, D.M. ∙ Munger, S.C. ... The Diversity Outbred mouse population Mamm. Genome. 2012; 23 :713-718 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, the DO ( Carmody et al., 2015 12. Carmody, R.N. ∙ Gerber, G.K. ∙ Luevano, Jr., J.M. ...

Genome-wide association study of behavioral, physiological and gene expression traits in outbred CFW mice Nat.

The emergence of this resource, together with concomitant advances in gene editing and circuit mapping technologies, offers a new opportunity for unbiased exploration of the molecular and neural circuit mechanisms of working memory.
Here, we phenotyped ∼200 DO mice in a working memory task and identified a significant QTL on chromosome 5 (∼4 Mb peak QTL, CI > 95%). Further examination of this locus, through gene-expression, loss of function, and behavioral studies, revealed a gene encoding an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, Gpr12 , that is required for, and can functionally promote, working memory. Subsequent molecular, cellular, and in vivo imaging studies together revealed that GPR12 is localized to the dendrites of thalamocortical neurons, facilitates activity-dependent calcium responses, and enables thalamocortical synchrony supporting behavioral performance. These results highlight a critical Gpr12 -dependent thalamic contribution to working memory.

Section: Results

The power to detect QTL in mapping studies depends on the relative magnitude of statistical signal to noise, which is influenced by (1) the reliability and reproducibility of the quantitative trait values and (2) robust genetic contribution to the phenotypic variance. To evaluate these parameters, we performed pilot experiments of common cognitive and social rodent behaviors in the founder strains (n = 8/strain) that contributed to the DO population. In some assays, including behaviors with innate, learned, and cognitive components, we observed substantially greater phenotypic variation across strains than within strain, suggesting genetic contribution likely outweighs that of technical artifacts ( Figure S1 A). We proceeded to perform a large-scale study using the DO population ( Figure 1 A) to study working memory, and specifically spatial working memory, which is well characterized in rodents ( Dudchenko 2004 28. Dudchenko, P.A. An overview of the tasks used to test working memory in rodents Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2004; 28 :699-709 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ) and has a strong heritable component in humans ( Knowles et al., 2014 44. Knowles, E.E.M. ∙ Mathias, S.R. ∙ McKay, D.R. ... Genome-wide analyses of working memory ability: a review Curr. Behav. Neurosci. Rep. 2014; 1 :224-233 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that 200 mice would provide sufficient power (60%–80%) to detect a QTL driven by a common allele that shifts the trait mean by 1 standard deviation at 95% confidence ( Churchill et al., 2012 17. Churchill, G.A. ∙ Gatti, D.M. ∙ Munger, S.C. ... The Diversity Outbred mouse population Mamm. Genome. 2012; 23 :713-718 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To assess working memory, we chose to assay the mice in a spontaneous alternation test, in which mice prefer to explore a new arm of a T-maze on every visit. In order to perform the task significantly above chance (22%), mice must remember the sequence of previously explored arms ( Lalonde, 2002 46. Lalonde, R. The neurobiological basis of spontaneous alternation Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2002; 26 :91-104 Crossref Scopus (636) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although performance on the task can be confounded by effects of sensory, motor, and motivational processes (which we attempted to control for post hoc), we chose this task because it requires minimal intervention. In particular, it is not subject to the variabilities often introduced by training, learning, or food/water deprivation and therefore would provide a high-throughput behavioral screen.
After phenotyping 193 mice ( STAR Methods ), we first confirmed that their phenotypic variation greatly exceeded that of the commonly used C57BL/6J inbred strain ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). Using a Bayesian linear mixed model, we estimated heritability to 46.2% (95% CI: 22.2%–69.1%), which is consistent with an important contribution of genetics to the observed phenotypic variability. In this task, mice can perform poorly for reasons unrelated to short-term memory, such as sensory, motor, or motivational deficits, or on the contrary, can perform exceptionally well if they have stereotypy (e.g., continuously turning right). We therefore assessed and found no systematic correlation between task performance and measures of gross motor ability, exploratory drive, motivation, stereotypy, body physique, or gross sensory ability ( Figures 1 C–1F; Table S1 ).
All mice were subsequently genotyped using the GigaMUGA platform (114,184 loci were found to have variability in our cohort). Founder haplotype reconstructions were performed with a hidden Markov model approach using R/qtl2 ( Broman et al., 2019 10. Broman, K.W. ∙ Gatti, D.M. ∙ Simecek, P. ... R/qtl2: Software for mapping quantitative trait loci with high-dimensional data and multiparent populations Genetics. 2019; 211 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ), which showed robust allelic heterozygosity across the genome ( Figure 1 G). Approximately equal founder contributions were observed across the population ( Figure S1 B), suggesting minimal genetic drift and allelic loss. We performed QTL mapping ( Figure S1 C) for working memory performance in 182 DO mice (11 mice with latency to first arm entry >180 s were excluded from analysis). We identified a single QTL, Smart1 (spontaneous T-maze alternation QTL 1), that is significant at a genome-wide p value of ≤0.01 on chromosome 5 (LOD score = 8.3, 95% CI: 143.2 Mb to 147.3 Mb) that explains 17% of the phenotypic variance ( Figure S1 D). Smart1 was also detected using another mapping approach, miQTL ( Figures 1 H and 1I), which is designed to assess whether uncertainty in founder haplotype reconstruction is strongly influencing the result. We also noticed potential peaks on chromosome 13 and 15; however, they did not rise to our threshold of significance ( Figure 1 H). It is possible that future analyses with larger DO cohorts will offer sufficient power to detect more modest effects and thereby resolve these peaks. In this study, though, we chose to focus on the clearly significant signal at Smart1 .
Next, we aimed to increase confidence that Smart1 is indeed important for driving variance in working memory performance. To do so, we performed an allele effects analysis ( STAR Methods ) at this locus and found that the CAST/EiJ haplotype (henceforth referred to as Smart1 CAST ) is associated with high performance while the C57BL/6J haplotype (henceforth referred to as Smart1 B6 ) is associated with poor performance ( Figure 2 A). A breakdown of the performance of individual mice by founder haplotype pairs (which we refer to as diplotype) at Smart1 revealed that, strikingly, 80% of mice with Smart1 CAST performed above the mean of the DO cohort, whereas this was true of only 20% of mice with Smart1 B6 ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Accordingly, mice with a Smart1 CAST/CAST (F × F) exhibited the highest performance (alongside E × F mice), while mice with a Smart1 B6/B6 (B × B) exhibited the lowest performance ( Figure S1 E). Furthermore, Smart1 CAST (F) when paired with any other founder haplotype was sufficient to improve performance to above average, while Smart1 B6 (B) when paired with any other founder haplotype was sufficient to reduce performance to below average ( Figure S1 E). The only exception to the latter was mice with the B × F diplotype, which had below-average performance, suggestive of dominance of the Smart1 B6 haplotype.
We then asked whether a genetically stable, multi-parent panel of recombinant inbred (RI) lines bearing either the CAST or C57 haplotype at Smart1 would naturally segregate into high and low performers respectively. The Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse resource ( Churchill et al., 2004 16. Churchill, G.A. ∙ Airey, D.C. ∙ Allayee, H. ..., Complex Trait Consortium The Collaborative Cross, a community resource for the genetic analysis of complex traits Nat. Genet. 2004; 36 :1133-1137 Crossref Scopus (891) PubMed Google Scholar ), which share the same founders as the DO population but have been inbred to produce genetically reproducible strains, were used to validate our findings from the analysis of DO mice ( Figure 2 D). We analyzed the genotypes of existing CC lines and identified two lines (CC012 and CC046) that, while representing unique and independent mosaics of the founder genomes, possessed Smart1 CAST/CAST . We found that CC046 and CC012 mice outperformed mice bearing Smart1 B6/B6 , CC004 and C57, respectively ( Figure 2 E), which was not due to differences in motor ability or motivation ( Figures S1 G and S1H). We further tested these mice in another working memory task, delayed non-match to place (DNMP) ( Dias and Aggleton, 2000 24. Dias, R. ∙ Aggleton, J.P. Effects of selective excitotoxic prefrontal lesions on acquisition of nonmatching- and matching-to-place in the T-maze in the rat: differential involvement of the prelimbic-infralimbic and anterior cingulate cortices in providing behavioural flexibility Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12 :4457-4466 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which mice first collect reward in one arm, then after a brief delay (10 s), learn that the subsequent reward will be in the opposite arm. After learning, progressive increases in delay period length reflect increases in working memory demand. Although all mice learned the task at the same rate ( Figure 2 F), CC012 ( Smart1 CAST/CAST ) performed significantly better than C57 when the delay period was increased to 20 s or 30 s ( Figure 2 G). These data indicate that genetic variation at Smart1 is sufficient to drive variation in working memory performance and that Smart1 CAST is associated with improved working memory.
We next aimed to determine which gene or variant within the locus is causally involved in driving variation in working memory performance. The preponderance of SNPs in non-coding regions ( Figures S2 A–S2C) suggested potential gene regulatory, and therefore gene expression, differences between high and low performers. We isolated brain regions with known or potential relevance for working memory including PFC, hippocampus (HPC), association thalamus, and ventral tegmental area (VTA), from high- (n = 3, Smart1 CAST ) and low- (n = 3, Smart1 B6 ) performing DO mice. After verifying that the dissections were well-targeted ( Figures S2 D and S2E), we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from those four brain regions and from six mice ( STAR Methods ).
High and low performers were stratified in all regions, including the PFC, which is the region most tied to working memory function ( Figure 3 A). However, of the four brain regions assessed, the mediodorsal thalamus exhibited the strongest clustering by performance, revealing a more global reprogramming of the transcriptome differentiating high and low performers ( Figure 3 A; Euclidean distance in mediodorsal thalamus = 30, HPC = 8, PFC = 13; VTA not shown). Enrichr analysis of genes contributing to the first principal component revealed three prominent signaling pathways: (1) synaptic signaling, (2) endocannabinoid signaling, and (3) calcium signaling ( Figures 3 B and 3C; PC1: 58% variance). Of the genes at the locus, one gene in PFC ( Nptx2 ) and three genes in mediodorsal thalamus ( Tmem130 , Gpr12 , Grid2ip ) passed the criteria of (1) robust expression (≥1,000 reads) ( Figure 3 D) and (2) significant expression fold difference between high and low performers (log2FC > 0.5 and adjusted p < 0.01) ( Figures 3 D and 3E).
We next determined which, if any, of these four genes, could causally drive changes in working memory performance. We developed and validated AAV-based RNA interference (RNAi) constructs to target Tmem130 , Nptx2 , and Gpr12 , as well as an AAV-hSyn-driven overexpression for Grid2ip (the injection of RNAi to Grid2ip resulted in death for the majority of the cohort) ( Figures S3 A–S3C), and bilaterally injected into the appropriate (PFC or mediodorsal thalamus) brain regions for behavioral testing ( Figure 4 A). Of note, we chose to target Tmem130 knockdown in thalamus (rather than PFC) because of the significantly greater expression levels in thalamus, together with the significant differential expression in thalamus by RNA-seq ( Figure S2 F). Since previous reports had linked the synaptogenic immediate early gene Nptx2 ( Xiao et al., 2017 73. Xiao, M.F. ∙ Xu, D. ∙ Craig, M.T. ... NPTX2 and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease eLife. 2017; 6 :23798 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the glutamate receptor-interacting protein Grid2ip ( Raghavan et al., 2018 61. Raghavan, N.S. ∙ Brickman, A.M. ∙ Andrews, H. ..., Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project Whole-exome sequencing in 20,197 persons for rare variants in Alzheimer’s disease Ann. Clin. Transl. Neurol. 2018; 5 :832-842 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) to Alzheimer’s, we expected their manipulation may contribute most to changes in working memory. Instead, we found, in blinded studies, that manipulation of an orphan GPCR, Gpr12 , in mediodorsal thalamus significantly and bidirectionally regulated working memory ( Figure 4 A). Gpr12 knockdown in mediodorsal thalamus of high-performing mice (CC012, Smart1 CAST/CAST ) significantly reduced spontaneous alternation performance (p < 0.001, unpaired t test with Welch’s correction), while overexpression in mediodorsal thalamus of low-performing (C57, Smart1 B6/B6 ) mice significantly improved mean performance ( Figure 4 A; p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA). Perturbations in the expression levels of Nptx2 , Grid2ip , or Tmem130 had no significant effect ( Figure 4 A).
The effects of Gpr12 were more dramatic when testing mice on another working memory task, DNMP, which involves delay-dependent representation of stimuli and is sensitive to temporal interference. Blinded testing and analyses of two independent cohorts revealed that Gpr12 knockdown in mediodorsal thalamus of high-performing CC012 mice significantly reduced delay-dependent working memory performance, shifting mean performance from 85% accuracy to 62% accuracy at the 30 s delay when compared with CC012 mice expressing scrambled RNAi controls ( Figure 4 B). Perhaps more strikingly, Gpr12 overexpression in the mediodorsal thalamus of low-performing C57 mice was sufficient to increase working memory performance, significantly improving mean performance at the 20 s delay and more dramatically at the 30 s delay from 58% to 80% (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA with repeated measures) when compared with C57s expressing mCherry control virus ( Figure 4 C). Importantly, no significant differences were observed during training ( Figures 4 B and 4C), and these effects were not observed in hippocampus ( Figure 4 D, S3 D, and S3E). Furthermore, the effects of Gpr12 were specific to working memory, as we saw no change in a test of spatial long-term memory ( Figure 4 E) and no apparent change in basic motor or motivational measures ( Figure S3 F). Post hoc histology and quantitative western blot confirmed that the expression constructs were expressing in the relevant brain regions ( Figures S4 A–S4C) and resulted in physiologically relevant ∼1- to 2.5-fold increase in protein levels during overexpression and ∼60% reduction during knockdown ( Figure S4 D). The in vivo knockdown of Nptx2 and Tmem130 was less efficient; therefore, we do not rule out the possibility that these genes or other genes at the Smart1 locus that were not explicitly tested may have contributions to working memory. However, we do conclude with confidence that Gpr12 expression in thalamus has strong, causal, and bidirectional contributions to working memory performance.
Gpr12 is a Class A GPCR that is conserved in mammals including humans ( Song et al., 1995 68. Song, Z.H. ∙ Modi, W. ∙ Bonner, T.I. Molecular cloning and chromosomal localization of human genes encoding three closely related G protein-coupled receptors Genomics. 1995; 28 :347-349 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). It belongs to a family of GPCRs that have no known ligand but are most closely related to lypophospholipid and cannabinoid receptor families (up to 40% homology) and less but significant homology with adenoreceptor and melanocortin receptor families. Accordingly, proposed native ligands include Tyrosol, SPC, and Nesfatin (all at nM affinity), while potential inverse agonists include cannabidiol (CBD) and pyrimidine analogs (weak affinities) ( Morales et al., 2018 54. Morales, P. ∙ Isawi, I. ∙ Reggio, P.H. Towards a better understanding of the cannabinoid-related orphan receptors GPR3, GPR6, and GPR12 Drug Metab. Rev. 2018; 50 :74-93 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). To understand further how Gpr12 may contribute to working memory performance, we asked (1) where is it localized?, (2) what downstream signal transduction is it coupled to in those neurons?, and (3) how do these properties impact its cellular and circuit-level functions?
We obtained a commercially available antibody for GPR12, and validated it using Gpr12 knockout HT22 cell lines ( Figures S4 I and S4J) and mouse brain tissue ( Figures S4 C and S4D). We then performed immunohistochemistry for GPR12 and found prominent expression in thalamus (primarily mediodorsal thalamus), hippocampus (primarily the CA2 region), and several cortical regions (primarily layers 2/3 and 5) ( Figure 5 A). These expression distributions were corroborated by follow-up in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments directed toward the mature Gpr12 messenger RNA ( Figure 5 B), as well as with publicly available single-cell sequencing data ( Saunders et al., 2018 66. Saunders, A. ∙ Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Wysoker, A. ... Molecular diversity and specializations among the cells of the adult mouse brain Cell. 2018; 174 :1015-1030.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (921) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether Gpr12 was expressed in a significant fraction of thalamocortical neurons, we retrogradely labeled neurons from layer 2/3 of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and overlaid Gpr12 expression by ISH. We found that approximately half of thalamocortical neurons contain Gpr12 ( Figures 5 B and 5C), which may be an underestimate given ∼100% specificity but ∼75% sensitivity in GFP control ISH experiments ( Figures 5 B and S4 E). Higher-resolution imaging of GPR12 revealed localization to the somato-dendritic compartment with lack of expression in axon terminals in PFC ( Figure S4 C). These expression and localization studies suggested that Gpr12 may have functions in thalamus that gate or promote neural activity interactions with PFC.
To better understand cellular functions of Gpr12 , we aimed to determine how Gpr12 couples to downstream signaling pathways. GPCRs have been implicated in working memory ( Dash et al., 2007 22. Dash, P.K. ∙ Moore, A.N. ∙ Kobori, N. ... Molecular activity underlying working memory Learn. Mem. 2007; 14 :554-563 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ; Arnsten and Jin, 2014 2. Arnsten, A.F. ∙ Jin, L.E. Molecular influences on working memory circuits in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2014; 122 :211-231 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tend to fall into three broad categories for downstream coupling: Gs (increased Ca 2+ and cAMP signaling), Gq (PLC/Dag/IP3 pathway), and Gi/o (decreased cAMP signaling). To differentiate among these possibilities, we began by manipulating Gpr12 in neuronal cell lines and assaying for resulting changes in calcium activity. Although no well-characterized high-affinity ligands currently exist for Gpr12 , we reasoned that since Gpr12 has constitutive receptor activity ( Uhlenbrock et al., 2002 71. Uhlenbrock, K. ∙ Gassenhuber, H. ∙ Kostenis, E. Sphingosine 1-phosphate is a ligand of the human gpr3, gpr6 and gpr12 family of constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors Cell. Signal. 2002; 14 :941-953 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), manipulation of expression level could serve as a proxy for activity levels. Upon transiently overexpressing Gpr12 in neuronally differentiated HT-22 cells ( Figure 5 D; STAR Methods ), we observed appreciable increases in the probability and magnitude of glutamate-induced calcium events compared with mCherry-expressing controls ( Figure 5 E). On the other hand, CRISPR-mediated Gpr12 knockout ( Figures S4 F–S4J) led to significant and prominent (almost 50%) reductions in the average glutamate-induced calcium response ( Figures 5 F and 5G). These experiments demonstrate that Gpr12 couples to signaling pathways that eventually lead to increases in activity-dependent calcium responses ( Figure 5 H).
To understand further how Gpr12 mediates increases in activity-induced calcium levels, we challenged HT22-derived neuronal cells with selective antagonists to known thalamic expressing voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) (targeting T-type, L-type, and Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels; Figure S5 A), in both wild-type and Gpr12 knockout cell lines, and under spontaneous as well as glutamate-induced conditions ( Figure 5 F). We found that the glutamate-induced calcium responses in Gpr12 -expressing groups (wild-type) were most susceptible to the L-type VGCC blockade, marked by significant reduction (∼60%), whereas in Gpr12 null groups (knockout), no reductions were observed ( Figures 5 I and 5J). On the contrary, both T-type and HCN blockers did not significantly discriminate between Gpr12 positive or null groups, suggesting they act on mechanisms independent of Gpr12 ( Figures 5 I and 5J). Accordingly, we also noted that of these VGCCs, only the L-type Cav1.2 channel was significantly upregulated in high-performing DO mice ( Figure S5 A). In summary, these experiments demonstrate that Gpr12 is localized to the somato-dendritic compartment of a subset of thalamocortical projecting neurons, has preferential coupling to L-type channels, and promotes the fidelity and magnitude of excitatory transmission.
Does Gpr12 have similar functions in vivo ? Does it couple to increases in activity-dependent calcium responses, and more importantly, how does that affect dialog with other relevant brain circuits, especially during working memory? To address these questions, we moved to an in vivo preparation where we used fiber photometry ( Cui et al., 2013 21. Cui, G. ∙ Jun, S.B. ∙ Jin, X. ... Concurrent activation of striatal direct and indirect pathways during action initiation Nature. 2013; 494 :238-242 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2016 43. Kim, C.K. ∙ Yang, S.J. ∙ Pichamoorthy, N. ... Simultaneous fast measurement of circuit dynamics at multiple sites across the mammalian brain Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :325-328 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ) to record bulk neural activity from PFC, mediodorsal thalamus, and HPC from low- (C57) and high- (CC012) performing mice during the DNMP task ( Figures 6 A–6C). Of note, CC012 lines ( Smart1 CAST/CAST ) have ∼2.5-fold higher mediodorsal thalamic expression of Gpr12 than low-performing C57s ( Smart1 B6/B6 ) ( Figure 6 D). We injected AAV9-GCaMP6f in PFC, mediodorsal thalamus, and HPC and implanted optical fibers above each region to record neural activity. Sufficient expression and accurate implantation of the injection site were confirmed by histology ( Figures S5 B and S5C). Neural activity recordings from multiple regions of a given animal were frame projected onto a camera sensor, and custom MATLAB scripts ( STAR Methods ) were used to extract time-series data, regress out motion-related artifacts, and align to behavioral data (one example alignment shown in Figure 6 C; additional raw traces in Figures S6 A and S6B).
While in the home cage, no significant differences between C57 and CC012 strains in average activity of any of the brain regions or in correlated patterns of activity between any two brain regions were observed ( Figure 6 E). However, during the task, we found that CC012 mice displayed significantly enhanced activity correlations between mediodorsal thalamus and PFC during several phases of the task ( Figure 6 F; all trials shown in Figure S6 E), which were reduced or absent in thalamus-HPC or PFC-HPC interactions and which was not due to differences in animal speed ( Figure S6 C), motion artifacts ( Figure S6 D), or accruing noise correlations in the GCaMP signal ( Figure 6 F; i.e., chance Pearson for delay period = 0.1 ± 0.2, 1,000x circular permutation). We also note that neurites are unlikely to contribute to the observed mediodorsal thalamus-PFC correlations because (1) we intentionally implanted these cannulas contra-laterally (the recurrent projections are primarily ipsilateral), and (2) the increased mediodorsal thalamus-PFC correlations was specific to CC012 mice, despite the fact that both strains had similar mean calcium activity in PFC and thalamus during behavior ( Figure 6 E, upper), and therefore similar contributions to activity in projection terminals.
We then asked whether the observed circuit level effects between CC012 versus C57 were attributable primarily to differences at the Smart1 locus and to differences in expression of Gpr12 . We therefore recorded bulk GCaMP6f-based neural activity in mice with overexpression of Gpr12 in mediodorsal thalamus (Gpr12) or RFP control vector (RFP). Sufficient expression and accurate implantation of the injection site were confirmed by histology ( Figures S5 D and S5E) and resulted in physiologically relevant ∼2-fold increase in Gpr12 transcript levels, comparable to ∼3-fold increase observed in CC012 mice ( Figure S5 F). As expected, Gpr12 mice had significantly higher delay-dependent working memory performance than the RFP control cohort ( Figure 6 B). In assessing brain activity, we found that Gpr12 mice displayed enhanced thalamocortical activity correlations during the encoding and memory maintenance phases of the task but not during start, choice, or reward ( Figure 6 G; all trials in Figure S6 F; no significant correlation with animal speed; Figure S6 G). Therefore, while the neural activity patterns in Gpr12 mice largely confirmed the findings from CC012 mice, the results suggest that Gpr12 has a specific role in targeting only thalamocortical synchrony and only for particular phases of the task ( Figure S6 E compared with Figure S6 F). Finally, not only were thalamocortical synchrony indicative of overall performance but, importantly, were predictive of accuracy on a trial-by-trial basis ( Figure 6 H). These results demonstrate that Gpr12 is critical, and indeed sufficient, for enhancing thalamocortical synchrony during working memory.
Lastly, we searched for additional features of Gpr12 -dependent neural activity patterns, beyond thalamocortical synchrony, that contributed to working memory choice accuracy. We observed that the magnitude of PFC activity succeeding the delay period, but just prior to the choice point (C’D), was highly predictive of upcoming decision, i.e., higher PFC activity was significantly more likely to lead to a correct choice ( Figure 6 I; p < 0.001, Tukey’s Multiple Comparisons). Furthermore, only PFC activity at the choice point was informative, since neither the PFC activity during other periods of the task nor the mediodorsal thalamus and HPC signals at the choice point were predictive of trial accuracy ( Figure S6 H). These results suggest a model in which mediodorsal thalamus-PFC synchrony during the delay period may enable the memory maintenance aspects of working memory, while transfer of control to PFC during the choice period may enable the executive component of working memory required for goal directed actions. These results demonstrate a critical Gpr12-dependent thalamic contribution to working memory and support more broadly the importance of thalamic contributions to higher-order cognitive processing ( Baddeley, 2012 4. Baddeley, A. Working memory: theories, models, and controversies Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2012; 63 :1-29 Crossref Scopus (2588) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmitt et al., 2017 67.

Section: Discussion

Using an unbiased genetic mapping approach in outbred mice, we identified a genomic locus, Smart1 , that is critical for explaining variation in a higher order cognitive process—working memory. Further characterization of this locus revealed an orphan GPCR, Gpr12 , that is not only required for working memory but, more importantly, its overexpression in thalamus is sufficient to reproduce the Smart1 CAST -associated increased performance in delay-dependent and -independent measures of working memory (SA and DNMP). Interestingly, Gpr12 is conserved only in mammals, including humans (consistent with a role in higher-order cognition), and human genome-wide association studies have reported intergenic GPR12 variants associated with cognitive performance ( Lee et al., 2018 47. Lee, J.J. ∙ Wedow, R. ∙ Okbay, A. ..., 23andMe Research Team, COGENT (Cognitive Genomics Consortium), Social Science Genetic Association Consortium Gene discovery and polygenic prediction from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in 1.1 million individuals Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :1112-1121 Crossref Scopus (1380) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as with treatment response in schizophrenia ( Drago and Kure Fischer, 2018 26. Drago, A. ∙ Kure Fischer, E. A molecular pathway analysis informs the genetic risk for arrhythmias during antipsychotic treatment Int. Clin. Psychopharmacol. 2018; 33 :1-14 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), a condition with significant working memory deficits.
The transcriptome-wide reprogramming of mediodorsal thalamus between high- and low-performing mice, the mediodorsal thalamus-specific behavioral effects of Smart1 CAST , and the functional contributions of Gpr12 all point toward a predominant role for thalamus in the working memory process. While pioneering studies have highlighted the importance of the PFC, there were also early hints in primate studies of the involvement of other brain structures ( Constantinidis and Procyk, 2004 19. Constantinidis, C. ∙ Procyk, E. The primate working memory networks Cogn. Affect. Behav. Neurosci. 2004; 4 :444-465 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recent studies have begun to articulate these complementary roles of other brain circuits ( Parnaudeau et al., 2013 58. Parnaudeau, S. ∙ O’Neill, P.K. ∙ Bolkan, S.S. ...

Kupferschmidt, D.A. ∙ Gordon, J.A. The dynamics of disordered dialogue: Prefrontal, hippocampal and thalamic miscommunication underlying working memory deficits in schizophrenia Brain Neurosci. Adv. 2018; 2 2398212818771821 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and in this regard, emerging studies have revisited the involvement of the thalamus ( Kupferschmidt and Gordon, 2018 45. Kupferschmidt, D.A. ∙ Gordon, J.A. The dynamics of disordered dialogue: Prefrontal, hippocampal and thalamic miscommunication underlying working memory deficits in schizophrenia Brain Neurosci. Adv. 2018; 2 2398212818771821 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Bolkan et al., 2017 8. Bolkan, S.S. ∙ Stujenske, J.M. ∙ Parnaudeau, S. ... Thalamic projections sustain prefrontal activity during working memory maintenance Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :987-996 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we join these studies in emphasizing that an entirely unbiased approach highlighted critical mediodorsal thalamus contributions and extend these studies in two important ways: (1) we provide an entry point ( Gpr12 -driven signaling) toward tangible insights into the molecular mechanisms mediating long range synchrony during working memory, and (2) we provide insights into the functional role of thalamus through simultaneous neural activity recordings from PFC, mediodorsal thalamus, and HPC during working memory. We found that mice overexpressing thalamic Gpr12 display striking thalamocortical synchrony during the encoding and memory maintenance phases of the task (but not between thalamus-HPC or PFC-HPC) that led to increased choice accuracy. The underlying source of this synchrony, however, is still unclear. Subsequent to the delay period, the synchrony abruptly disappeared but high PFC activity was maintained, and preferentially on correct trials. These results suggest that thalamus may serve not only to enhance short-term memory during the delay period but also for handoff to PFC for subsequent executive control and choice. Given recent reports of the contributions of mediodorsal thalamus in sensory gating and attention ( Schmitt et al., 2017 67. Schmitt, L.I. ∙ Wimmer, R.D. ∙ Nakajima, M. ... Thalamic amplification of cortical connectivity sustains attentional control Nature. 2017; 545 :219-223 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is possible that Gpr12 functions to enhance attention during working memory, but because the impact of Gpr12 progressively increased during successively longer delay periods (from 10 s up to 45 s), a more specific role in the maintenance of working memory is likely. Furthermore, a previous study reported on the importance of long-range synchrony between motor thalamus and motor cortex in sustaining motor planning ( Guo et al., 2017 35. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), which, together with recent reports ( Bolkan et al., 2017 8. Bolkan, S.S. ∙ Stujenske, J.M. ∙ Parnaudeau, S. ... Thalamic projections sustain prefrontal activity during working memory maintenance Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :987-996 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmitt et al., 2017 67. Schmitt, L.I. ∙ Wimmer, R.D. ∙ Nakajima, M. ... Thalamic amplification of cortical connectivity sustains attentional control Nature. 2017; 545 :219-223 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our work, suggests common thalamocortical motifs in sustaining neural representations across sensory, cognitive, and motor domains.
Future studies investigating Gpr12 cellular and circuit mechanisms will further clarify existing models of working memory ( Miller et al., 2018 53. Miller, E.K. ∙ Lundqvist, M. ∙ Bastos, A.M. Working Memory 2.0 Neuron. 2018; 100 :463-475 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ), where our current data favor persistent activity interleaved with periods of short-term plasticity ( Figure 6 J). It will also be important to explore whether Gpr12 contributes to non-spatial and more general forms of working memory and whether other genetic loci may complement Gpr12 functions during working memory. Finally, manipulations of mediodorsal thalamus during neural activity recordings of related circuits will add to our understanding of long-range synchrony ( Katz and Shatz, 1996 41.

Harris, A.Z. ∙ Gordon, J.A. Long-range neural synchrony in behavior Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 38 :171-194 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the dynamics of a broader neuroanatomically distributed network that shape this higher-order cognitive process ( Kupferschmidt and Gordon, 2018 45. Kupferschmidt, D.A. ∙ Gordon, J.A. The dynamics of disordered dialogue: Prefrontal, hippocampal and thalamic miscommunication underlying working memory deficits in schizophrenia Brain Neurosci. Adv. 2018; 2 2398212818771821 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, this study offers proof of principle that the DO population can be leveraged to identify QTLs with narrow intervals and large effect sizes that can reveal critical insights into cognitive processes. This may be a generalizable approach toward the use of rodent models to dissect discrete brain functions often amalgamated in neuropsychiatric disease ( Tarantino and Bucan, 2000 69.

All procedures were done in accordance with guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (protocol #17002) at The Rockefeller University.
All animals were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Diversity Outbred (DO) mice were obtained from the 25 th generation of the population. Mice were aged 8 weeks (DO mice and Collaborative Cross [CC] lines phenotyping), 10 weeks (photometry cohorts), or 12-15 weeks (RNAi and Overexpression cohorts) for various experiments and housed under a 12 h light–dark cycle in a temperature-controlled environment with access to food and water anytime. Mice were single housed for DO phenotyping and group housed with littermates (4 mice/cage) for all other behavioral cohorts. DO phenotyping was performed with all males to sufficiently power the study at affordable cost, but future studies will use female-only or mixed cohorts. For DO phenotyping, of initial 200 mice purchased, 193 were phenotyped in spontaneous alternation (7 died), and of these, 182 were used for QTL mapping (another 11 did not perform the task). For Delay non-Match to Place (DNMP) behavioral training and testing, mice were food-restricted (CC phenotyping, RNAi and Overexpression cohorts) or water-restricted (photometry cohort) and maintained at 85% of their initial weight.
SNP locations and genotypes for the eight founder strains were acquired from ftp.jax.org/MUGA and the consensus genotype for each founder strain and each SNP was determined from the multiple individuals that were genotyped. SNP genotypes for the 182 DO mice were determined using a high density mouse universal genotyping array, GigaMUGA (geneSeek). A total of 114,184 SNPs were detected on the 19 autosomes and X chromosomes. Using R/qtl2 ( Broman et al., 2019 10. Broman, K.W. ∙ Gatti, D.M. ∙ Simecek, P. ... R/qtl2: Software for mapping quantitative trait loci with high-dimensional data and multiparent populations Genetics. 2019; 211 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ), founder haplotype probabilities were reconstructed for all samples and then converted to additive allelic dosages and scaled to 1. Realized genetic relationship matrices, often referred to as kinship matrices, were estimated using the leave one chromosome out (LOCO) method, so that the kinship term does not absorb variation explained by the putative QTL.

Integrative QTL analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility identifies multi-tissue patterns of genetic regulation PLoS Genet. 2020; 16 :e1008537 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ), was used to confirm findings from R/qtl2, and to visualize and assess the level of heterozygosity at the locus of interest.
Heritability is the ratio of the variance component corresponding to the kinship term over the sum of the kinship variance component and the noise variance i.e., the proportion of variance explained by genetic factors. Heritability for the phenotype of interest in this DO cohort was estimated using a Bayesian linear mixed model ( Rue et al., 2009 64. Rue, H. ∙ Martino, S. ∙ Chopin, N. Approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models by using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B 2009 319-392 Google Scholar ), which is appealing because of the ease by which it provides interval estimates. The phenotype was centered and scaled, and modeled as a linear function of the random kinship term representing the correlation structure encoded in the genetic relationship matrix (often referred to as the kinship matrix), and an unstructured error term.
Phenotype values from the spontaneous alternation test (% alternation) were subject to Box-Cox transformation. Then, using R/qtl2, an additive single locus linear mixed model was fit at positions across the genome, producing a genome scan. Potential population structure was controlled for through the inclusion of a random effect to account for correlation structure measured by the kinship matrix. This was performed in R/qtl2 using the leave one chromosome out (LOCO) method ( Kang et al., 2010 40. Kang, H.M. ∙ Sul, J.H. ∙ Service, S.K. ... Variance component model to account for sample structure in genome-wide association studies Nat. Genet. 2010; 42 :348-354 Crossref Scopus (1911) PubMed Google Scholar ). For confirmation of the QTL results, we performed a multiple imputation genome scan (11 imputations) using miQTL ( Keele et al., 2020 42. Keele, G.R. ∙ Quach, B.C. ∙ Israel, J.W. ... Integrative QTL analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility identifies multi-tissue patterns of genetic regulation PLoS Genet. 2020; 16 :e1008537 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ), to assess whether uncertainty in founder haplotype reconstruction was strongly influencing the results. Genome-wide significance thresholds (alpha = 0.05) for the genome scans were determined through 1000 permutations of the diplotype.
To determine the founder haplotype effects driving Smart1 , we first estimated best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs), which constrain potentially unstable effects by fitting the QTL term as a random effect. To further confirm these results, we used Diploffect ( Zhang et al., 2014 74. Zhang, Z. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Valdar, W. Bayesian modeling of haplotype effects in multiparent populations Genetics. 2014; 198 :139-156 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), to estimate posterior credible intervals for the haplotype effects as well as the proportion of variance explained by the QTL (sometimes referred to as the locus heritability).
Tests were conducted in the T-maze with the following arm dimensions: 12 × 3 x 5 in (L x W x H) and recorded using a ceiling-mounted camera under red light illumination. Testing consisted of a single 5 min trial, in which the mouse was allowed to explore all three arms of the T-maze. Mice were acclimatized to the experimental site for 1 h before all experiments. The experimenter was blind to the viral condition of all mice during behavioral testing, but were unable to be blinded to identity when testing C57 (black) versus CC012 (gray) mice because of the difference in their coat color. We timed latency to leave the start box and if it exceeds 3 min, mice are pushed out with a pen. Entries into each arm were tracked: start arm is M, left (bottom) arm is L, right (top) arm is R ( Table S1 ). Sequences of arm entries were manually recorded from video recording (DO phenotyping) or automatically tracked by EthoVision XT (Noldus) software (Collaborative Cross lines, RNAi, and Overexpression cohorts). Percentage alternation [%] was defined as consecutive entries in 3 different arms, divided by the number of possible alternations (total arm entries minus 2. A direct revisit (ie., MM) or an indirect revisit (ie., MLM) to an arm was classified as an incorrect alternation. Percentage error [%] was calculated as the ratio of incorrect alternations to total alternations. Mice with less than 8 arm entries during the 5 min trial were excluded from analysis.
Percentage alternation scores were then compared to: the total number of arm entries, total distance traveled, latency to first goal arm entry, stereotypy, and performance on a contextual fear-conditioning task, to determine if performance was influenced by factors that may confound working memory performance such as gross motor, motivational, or sensory deficits respectively. The stereotypy index was defined as the number of counter-clockwise alternation triplets (RLM, LMR, MRL) subtracted from the number of clockwise triplets (LRM, RML, MLR), divided by the total number of correct alternations.
Testing was conducted using the same T-maze as described in the spontaneous alternation test. Mice were gradually food restricted to 85% of their body weight at 8 weeks age (Collaborative Cross lines) or 2-6 weeks after viral injection/ cannula implantation surgeries (photometry, RNAi, and Overexpression cohorts). Habituation systemically reduces novelty and exploratory-drives to confound working memory assessment. Mice were first habituated to the T-maze over 2-3 d before DNMP training. During habituation, mice were allowed to freely explore the maze, where 20mg chocolate pellets (AIN-76A, TestDiet) were placed in an octagonal dish at the end of each arm, for 20-30 min with their cage-mates (CC mice, RNAi, and Overexpression cohorts), or while tethered to optical fibers and/or the recording tether (photometry cohort). On the subsequent 5-6 days mice underwent DNMP training, which consisted of 10 trials per day. Each trial consisted of two phases, a forced choice followed by a free choice. At the beginning of each trial, a small octagonal dish with a chocolate pellet was deposited at the end of each goal arm, and a sliding guillotine door was positioned to block entry to either the left or right goal arm in a pseudorandom order. For the forced choice run, the mouse was placed at the base of the T-maze and allowed to obtain the pellet from the open, baited arm before returning to and being enclosed in the start box. After a 10 s delay period, in which both arms were made accessible, the mouse was released to enter the arm of choice. Sample arm runs were pseudo-randomly selected on a trial-by-trial basis. A trial was considered correct if the mouse entered the goal arm not visited during the forced choice and was able to collect the pellet, and incorrect if they revisited the same arm, where they were confined without reward for 20 s. In the photometry cohort, mice were water deprived and trained to receive a 20 μL water drop reward, instead of chocolate pellet. In addition, photometry mice were tethered to optical fibers on training days 3-5. Daily training continued until mice reached criterion performance, defined as 2 consecutive days above 70% without displaying a strong arm preference (mice that didn’t meet criterion were excluded from subsequent studies, except for Gpr12RNAi injected CC012 cohort where due to the ceiling effect for low performers, no mice were excluded). Mice with extreme day-to-day variability during training were also excluded from subsequent analysis (demonstrated by significant deviations from the 90% prediction interval of a best-fit line of reference from c57 mice, n = 17). One day after completion of DNMP training, mice were tested on 10 trials at an extended delay period of 20 s and the following day at 30 s (45 s was also tested in the photometry cohort). The experimenter was blind to the viral treatments (ie. targeted RNAi, overexpression, scramble RNAi, or mCherry) of mice during behavioral testing. For photometry experiments, testing at the 45 s delay occurred over two days to collect more trials and minimize bleaching of GCaMP fluorescence. All behavior was conducted during the light cycle.
The object-place memory arena consisted of a square box (16”Wx16”Dx14”H). The subject’s ability to recognize that an object that it had experienced before had changed location was assessed. Mice habituated to an empty arena for 10 min. ahead of each phase. In the training phase, mice were exposed to objects F1 and F2 (F: familiar), which were placed in the far corners of the arena, with an internal cue (and marked with lab tape). The animal was allowed to explore both objects during two sample sessions of 5 min, with an inter-session interval of 5 min. In between each trial, the mouse was removed from the box and placed in the home cage while the box was cleaned with 10% Ethanol and then water. All objects were cleaned with 10% Ethanol and then water after trials. After a delay of 24 h, the testing phase began. In the testing phase, object F1 was placed in the same position, while object F2 was placed in the midway-to-corner adjacent to the original position (N, novel place), so that the two objects F1 and N were at least 30° juxtaposed. Mice were placed into the arena facing opposite toward the wall with internal cue and objects, and allowed to freely explore the environment and the objects for 5 min. Time spent exploring the displaced and non-displaced objects was measured. The identity of the objects as well as the spatial location in which the objects were located was balanced between subjects. After 24 h, mice were placed back in the arena for the 2 nd testing phase, again facing opposite toward the wall with internal cue and objects. The two objects were present, object F1 was now displaced to a novel spatial (N1) location while the other (F2) stayed at the same place as in the first testing day. Mice were again allowed to freely explore the environment and the objects for 5 min. The discrimination index (DI) used to assess memory performance was calculated as the difference in time exploring the novel object location and stable location divided by the total exploration time. This results in a score ranging from −1 (preference for the stable location) to +1 (preference for the moving object location). A score of 0 indicates no preference for either object location.
The fear conditioning chamber consisted of a square conditioning cage (7”Wx7”Dx12”H) with a grid floor wired to a shock generator and a scrambler, with a house light, and encompassed in an acoustic chamber (Coulburn Instruments, PA, USA). Mice were first habituated in this chamber for 120 s. Subsequently, fear conditioning was performed by placing mice in the conditioning cage (visual cues: bare walls; tactile cues: grid floor; house light off), while receiving three 2 s shock pulses of 7 mA at 90 s, 120 s, and 150 s with house light continuously on. Mice stayed in the conditioning chamber for an additional 60 s before returning to the home cage. Approximately 24 h later, memory retrieval was tested by returning mice to the original chamber for 3.5 min in the absence of any shocks. The chamber was cleaned with 10% alcohol after each subject was trained or tested. Freezing behavior on training and retrieval days were recorded and analyzed offline using the automated motion detection software FreezeFrame (Coulburn, USA) and fear memory was assessed as percentage time spent freezing in the last 2 min of the retrieval session.
Surgical procedures and viral injections were carried out under protocols approved by Rockefeller University IACUC and were performed in mice anesthetized with 1%–2% isoflurane using a stereotactic apparatus (Kopf). In RNAi experiments, C57 or CC012 mice were bilaterally injected in the mdTh or PFC with an AAV9 expressing either scramble (non-targeting) RNAi-RFP or targeted RNAi-RFP (ie. Gpr12, Tmem130, Nptx2 RNAi ) constructs under the U6 promoter at a volume of 1.0 μL (0.1 μL/min). In gene expression experiments, mice were bilaterally injected in the mdTh with AAV9 expressing either mCherry or Grid2ip-t2A-tdTomato or Gpr12-ires-tdTomato construct under the human Synapsin (hSYN) promoter at a volume of 1.0 μL. In TC retrograde tracing experiments, an rgAAV expressing eGFP under the chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter was injected unilaterally into the PFC at a volume of 1 μL (0.1 μL/min). Two mice were used and results were highly consistent. In multi-fiber photometry experiments, AAV1-CaMKIIa-GCaMP6f was delivered unilaterally to the PFC and HPC, and AAV1-CAG-GCaMP6f was delivered contra-laterally to the mdTH at a volume of 1.0 μL (0.1 μL/min). After viral delivery, an additional 5-10 min delay was applied to ensure viral spread before slowly removing injection needle. GCaMP6-expressing virus and rgAAV-GFP virus were obtained commercially from the UPenn Viral Core. Custom RNAi and gene expression AAV production was carried out at Vigene Biosciences and Boston Children’s Hospital Viral Core, respectively. Viral and tracer coordinates were as follows (in mm): mdTh coordinates: −1.25 A/P, −3.4 D/V, ± 0.4 M/L; PFC coordinates: 1.8 A/P, −1.7 D/V, ± 0.35 M/L; HPC coordinates: −1.5 AP, −1.8 D/V, +1.75 M/L. Coordinates are relative to bregma (A/P, M/L) and to skull (D/V)
In multi-fiber photometry experiments, one week after GCaMP viral injection (coordinates specified in Figure S5 B), mice were unilaterally implanted with 1.25 mm ferrule-coupled optical fibers (0.48 NA, 400 μm diameter) immediately dorsal to the targeted structure (mdTh, PFC or HPC), fixed to the skull with dental cement. A light weight titanium head plate implant was used to enable stable head fixation during tethering of the animal to optical patchcords each day.
For tissue extraction, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and immediately decapitated in compliance with IACUC protocol #17002. The targeted brain regions were harvested from 1 mm brain slices ( Figure 3 A), obtained by brain matrices (ZIVIC) using 1.0 mm tissue punches and transferred to a tube containing 300 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer and 3 μL β-mercaptoethanol (Total RNA Purification kit, NORGEN; following the manufacturer’s protocol). Samples were then homogenized by passing a 25G insulin syringe six times and left on ice.For RNA extraction, the total RNA Purification kit was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (NORGEN). RNA quality was evaluated by Bioanalyzer 2100 (Eukaryote Total RNA Nano chip, Agilent) at the Rockefeller University Genomic Resource Center (RIN > = 7.50 and free of genomic DNA contamination). RNA samples were then aliquoted and stored at −80°C.
For RNaseq, RNA libraries were prepared from 100ng of total RNA per sample for 6 DO mice, 4 brain regions per mouse ( Figure 3 A) using the TruSeq stranded mRNA LT kit (Cat# RS-122-2101, Illumina). These synthetic RNAs cover a range of concentrations, length, and GC content for validation of the fidelity and dose-response of the library prior to downstream procedures. Libraries prepared with unique barcodes were pooled at equal molar ratios following manufacturer’s protocol (Cat# 15035786 v02, Illumina). The pool was denatured and subject to paired-end 50x sequencing on the Hi-Seq 2500 platform. An average of 67 million reads per sample were obtained. Sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using STAR (v2.4.2a) and aligned reads were quantified using Salmon (v0.8.2). Approximately 90% of the reads mapped uniquely. Hierarchical clustering and Principal Components Analysis were performed following Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST) from DESeq2, which is on the log2 scale and accounts for library size differences. The hierarchical clustering heatmap shows the Euclidean distances of VST of the counts between samples.
For quantitative PCR, each reverse transcription was performed with 0.2 μg RNA using the TruScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (NORGEN), in a final volume of 10 μl. Primers for reverse transcription were equal mixtures of poly-T nucleotides and random hexamers. Negative controls (omitting reverse transcriptase enzyme) were performed for each sample. The cDNA products were diluted 1:10 and 2 μl was analyzed by qPCR using custom primer sets using SYBR Green dye (20 μl total reaction, BioRad). RT-qPCRs were performed on a Lightcycler 480 from Roche. Every reaction was systematically run in triplicate. Conditions were the following: 50°C 2 min, 95°C 10 min, 40 × (95°C 15 s, 60°C 1 min). qPCR Ct values were analyzed using the LightCycler software. Detection threshold was set at ΔRn = 0.3, with this limit always within the 2n exponential amplification phase of genes. Mean of technical triplicate values were reported. All DO mice gene expression Ct values were normalized with the reference gene Ube2d2a using ΔΔCt method to determine the relative mRNA expression of each gene. γTubulin was used as a reference gene to control for potential differences between strains (C57 versus CC012).
We used the following shRNAs for gene knockdown (which were then subcloned into a pAV-U6-RFP construct, VigeneBiosciences): Gpr12 (GenBank: NM_008151.3 ), Targeting sequence: TACATCCAGATTTGTAAGAT; Tmem130 (GenBank: NM_177735.4 ), Targeting sequence: AATCTAACCTCGACCATCC; Nptx2 (GenBank: NM_016789 ), Targeting sequence: CCGTCGTGCAGCAGAAGGAGACG. For gene expression, coding sequence of Gpr12 and Grid2ip were cloned from mouse cDNA clone (TrueORF cDNA Clones, OriGene) and subsequently subcloned into a pAAV–hSYN-ires tdTomato expression vector using standard molecular cloning techniques (the C¢ V5-epitope tags in frame with the coding forward-reading frame). Constructs were verified first by Sanger sequencing, and then diagnostics for ITR integrity, by digestion with SmaI, before AAV production.
Protein lysates were prepared from 5-15mg of micro-dissected brain tissue. Tissue samples were homogenized using a 25G syringe in 1.5 ml ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor (ProteoExtract Cat#71772-3, Calbiochem) and kept at 4°C for 40 min before the cytosolic fraction was removed by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.2 mL Extaction Buffer containing 2% protease inhibitor cocktail and incubate for 45 min with gentle agitation. Debris were removed by 16,000 g centrifugation and the supernatant, which is enriched in membrane proteins was either stored or mixed with 50% 2x LDS sample buffer (#NP0007; Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and boiled at 70 °C for 10 min. 30 μg of protein per sample was used in the case of mediodorsal thalamus lysates to evaluate Gpr12 expression ( Figure S4 D); 50 μg of protein was used in the case of HT-22 isolations ( Figure S4 I). Using SDS polyacrylamide gels (12% or 8%–16%), we separated samples via electrophoresis with Tris–glycine buffer (25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS) and transferred onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (0.45 μm; Millipore) with Towbin buffer containing 25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine and 20% methanol using a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad) with the following settings: 25 V maximum overnight. After transfer, membranes were washed with water and air-dried, followed by blocking membranes in 5% skim milk/TBS for 30 min at room temperature and blocking for further 30 min in fresh solution. Incubation with primary antibody was performed overnight on a shaker (60 rpm) at 4 °C in 3% skim milk/TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-Gpr12 (AVIVA, Cat#ARP64695; 1:1,000) and anti-Tubulin (Covance, Cat#MMS-435P; 1:2,000). Membranes were washed three times in TBST at room temperature on a shaker (60 rpm) for 10 min, followed by a 2-h incubation of 1:15,000 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor 780 or 1:20,000 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor 680 (LI-COR) in 3% skim milk/TBST on a shaker (60 rpm) at room temperature. For quantification, samples were run as biological replicates on one membrane, and the mean was further used for graphs and statistics, with the exception of Figure S4 I, where samples were run as duplicates. Non-saturated images were used and analyzed with Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR).
The hybridization protocol used in the present study was adapted from the HCR v3.0 Molecular Instruments protocol ( Choi et al., 2010 15. Choi, H.M.T. ∙ Chang, J.Y. ∙ Trinh, A. ... Programmable in situ amplification for multiplexed imaging of mRNA expression Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :1208-1212 Crossref Scopus (504) PubMed Google Scholar ). After perfusion, brains were kept in 4% PFA overnight, then transferred to 30% sucrose overnight, both times at 4°C on a nutator. Brains were sliced to 45 μm thickness using a microtome. Brain slices were prehybridized in 500 μL probe hybridization buffer (Molecular Instruments) for 30 min at 37°C. Slices were then incubated in probe solution (Molecular Instruments) containing 12 nM of probe of interest overnight at 37°C on a nutator. The next day, slices were rinsed 4x15 min with probe wash buffer at 37°C (Molecular Instruments) and 3 × 5 min with 5X saline sodium citrate with 0.1% Tween-20 (SSCT) at room temperature. Slices were then pre-amplified in 500 μL of amplification buffer for 30 min at room temperature on a nutator and transferred to hairpin mixture solution containing 60 nM of both snap-cooled hairpin 1 and hairpin 2 (Molecular Instruments); slices were incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature on a nutator. The next day, slices were rinsed with 5X-SSCT for 2 × 5 min and 2 × 30 min at room temperature. Slices were then mounted on glass slides (ProLong Diamond- Invitrogen mounting media).
Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PB, then brains were post-fixed by immersion for ∼24 h in the perfusate solution followed by 30% sucrose in 0.1M PB at 4°C. The fixed tissue was cut into 40 μm coronal sections using a freezing microtome (Leica SM2010R), stained with DAPI (1:1000 in PBST), and mounted on slides with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen). For immunostaining, the fixed sections were permeabilized with 70% methanol for 15 min before blocking with 5% normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Afterward, coverslips were mounted using ProLong Diamond Antifade mounting medium for image collection. Primary and secondary antibodies include rabbit polyclonal anti-Gpr12 (AVIVA, Cat#ARP64695), guinea pig polyclonal anti-Parvalbumin (SWANT, Cat#GP72), mouse monoclonal anti-V5 tag (Invitrogen, Cat# R960-25), mouse monoclonal anti-Tubulin (Covance, Cat#MMS-435P), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 715-546-150), Rhodamine Red-X donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 711-296-152), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 706-606-148), DAPI (Cayman Chemical, Cat#28718-90-3). For immunohistochemistry staining, confocal images were obtained at room temperature on Zeiss LSM 790 at 2,048 × 2,048 pixels using a Zeiss 5 × (NA 0.15, dry), 20x dry objectives with the same settings and configurations for all samples within each experiment.
HT-22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cell lines (Sigma-Aldrich), were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For the dual-guide approach, we transfected HT-22 with both Gpr12 gRNA1 and gRNA2 Cas9 vectors and collected individual HT-22 colonies after puromycin selection (3000 μg/mL). At 24 h after transfection, cells were dissociated and single cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) gated for a high level of RFP expression. Genomic DNAs from individual colonies were screened by PCR for the presence of an expected –0.7-kb junction product ( Figure S4 F). Complete protein depletion in each target gene was confirmed by Western Blot analyses of clonal cell lines.
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting was used to deplete Gpr12 in HT-22 cells. We used the CRISPR Design Tool ( https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design ) to obtain the sequences of guide RNAs targeting the Gpr12 Exon2 segment. The design of guide RNAs and reference sequences are based on genome assembly GRCm38. We then performed a degenerate BLAST search with all possible guides to identify sequences that would uniquely target Gpr12 locus with no predicted off-target effects. The sequences of dual-guide RNAs were as follows: Gpr12 gRNA1: 5¢- GGGTTGTCTGTCTTTCTCTG; Gpr12 gRNA2: 5¢- GGGTTGTCTGTCTTTCTCTG. Gpr12 gRNA1 was cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro plasmid with a puromycin resistance marker (pX459, Addgene plasmid 48139) using a BbsI restriction site. Gpr12 gRNA2 was cloned into EF1a-T7-hspCas9-T2A-RFP-H1-gRNA Cloning Vector (SystemBiosciences). Validation of the guide sequence in the Cas9 vectors was confirmed by Sanger Sequencing. Before transfection, all plasmids were purified using EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (QIAGEN).
HT-22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (Signa-Aldrich) as control cells (wildtype) and CRISPR-mediated knockout cells lacking Gpr12 (deletion mutation c. 96_538del443 at Gpr12 locus) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells were differentiated in NeuroBasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 mmol/L glutamine and 1 × N2 supplement (Invitrogen) for 24 h. before use. Only cells with passage number < 20 were used. For all imaging studies, cells were plated on black 24 well plate with flat and clear bottom (#1.5 polymer coverslip, ibidi) pre-coated with poly-D-lysine. For overexpression of Gpr12 , we applied Lipofectamine (Invitrogen)-mediated transfection on wildtype cells with expression vector encoding Gpr12 (aav-hsyn-Gpr12-iresTdT or pCMV6-Gpr12-iresTdT) for 12 h.
Differentiated neuronal cells were loaded with the cytosolic Ca 2+ indicator, 5 μM Cal520-AM dye (Aat Bioquet) to study cytosolic Ca 2+ dynamics, in a Ca 2+ -containing HEPES buffered salt solution (Ca 2+ -HBSS) composed of (mM): 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose; pH = 7.4 in 37°C for 20 min. Following dye loading, cultured plate were perfused with PBS buffer to remove excessive dye for three times prior to imaging. Cells were imaged in Leibovitz’s L-15 buffer (with additional 30 mM CaCl2, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 8 mM glucose and 10 mM sodium HEPES, and no phenol red, pH 7.4; Sigma-aldrich) on a Nikon TiE inverted fluorescence microscope with Perfect Focus mechanism. Intracellular Cal520-AM was illuminated at 488 nm from LED light source. Wide-field fluorescence images were captured with Flur Apo 40X objective and sCMOS camera (Andor Neo) at image size of 1024 × 1024 pixels and an acquisition rate of 4 frames per s. Cells were treated with the excitatory neurotransmitter, 10 mM L-glutamic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), to induce neural activity at either 30 s (Gpr12 overexpression experiments) or 15 s (Gpr12 knockout and calcium channel blockade experiments) during continuous live-cell imaging. Experiments were performed at 37°C in environmental chamber.
Image data in NIS-Elements (Nikon) ND2 format were converted into tiff stacks and processed in ImageJ (US National Institutes of Health). Regions of interest (ROIs) were automatically selected from a binary z-projection image for each FOV and the gray value was averaged for each ROI for a given time point. Duplicate, false-positive, and incomplete (i.e., cells at the edges of FOV) ROIs were manually excluded from further analysis. The extracted fluorescence intensity changes were detrended (MATLAB “detrend”). Significant calcium events were defined as those signals that exceed the mean baseline by 2 or more standard deviations ( Rajasethupathy et al., 2015 62. Rajasethupathy, P. ∙ Sankaran, S. ∙ Marshel, J.H. ... Projections from neocortex mediate top-down control of memory retrieval Nature. 2015; 526 :653-659 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Gpr12 overexpression experiments). Activity-dependent (ie. Glutamic acid-induced) calcium event amplitudes were expressed as a fluorescence ratio (ΔF/F0) by taking the intensity at the time of peak fluorescence (ΔF) divided by the mean fluorescence (F0) at that pixel averaged over a 100 frame-window surrounding the stimulation event ( Gpr12 knockout and VGCC blockade experiments). Spontaneous activity was defined as the number of time points where signals deviate from the mean baseline by more than one standard deviation during resting state (no glutamic acid stimulation). Same analyses were performed to measure the spontaneous and glutamic acid-induced calcium event aptitudes under different blocker treatment conditions. We performed 4 independent experiments for each treatment condition and Student’s t test was used to identify significant differences between control and knockout groups.
A custom multi-fiber photometry setup was built as previously described ( Kim et al., 2016 43. Kim, C.K. ∙ Yang, S.J. ∙ Pichamoorthy, N. ... Simultaneous fast measurement of circuit dynamics at multiple sites across the mammalian brain Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :325-328 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ), with some modifications that were incorporated to increase signal to noise, detailed below. Excitation of the 470 nm (imaging) and 405 nm (isosbestic control) wavelengths were provided by LEDs (Thorlabs M470F3, M405FP1) which are collimated into a dichroic mirror holder with a 425 nm long pass filter (Thorlabs DMLP425R). This is coupled to another dichroic mirror holder with a 495 nm long pass dichroic (Semrock FF495-Di02-25x36) which redirects the excitation light on to a custom branching fiberoptic patchcord of three bundled 400 μm diameter 0.22NA fibers (BFP(3)_400/440/900-0.22_2m_SMA ∗ -3xFC, Doric Lenses) using a 10x/0.5NA Objective lens (Nikon CFI SFluor 10X, Product No. MRF00100). GCaMP6f fluorescence from neurons below the fiber tip in the brain was transmitted via this same cable back to the mini-cube, where it was passed through a GFP emission filter (Semrock FF01-520/35-25), amplified, and focused onto a high sensitivity sCMOS camera (Prime 95b, Photometrics).
The multiple branch ends of the branching fiberoptic patchcord were connected to an array of three fiberoptic rotary joints (FRJ_1x1_FC-FC, Doric Lenses) and coupled to three 1 m low-autofluorescence patchcords (MFP_400/430/1100-0.57_1m_FC-ZF1.25_LAF, Doric Lenses) which is used to collect emission fluorescence from 1.25mm diameter light weight ferrules (MFC_400/430-0.48_ZF1.25, Doric Lenses) using a mating sleeve (Doric SLEEVE_ZR_1.25). The excitation is alternated between 405nm and 470nm by a custom made JK flip flop which takes the trigger input from the sCMOS and triggers the two excitation LEDs alternatively. Bulk activity signals were collected using the PVCAM software, and data were further post-processed and analyzed using custom MATLAB scripts.
Mice performed the delayed to non-matching place (DNMP) task while we recorded bulk calcium signals from three regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HPC) and mediodorsal thalamus (mdTh), simultaneously. We recorded at 15 Hz frequency with excitation alternating between 470 nm (calcium dependent fluorescence) and 405 nm (calcium independent fluorescence) excitation wavelengths, resulting in an effective frame rate of 7.5 Hz, sufficient for capturing GCaMP6f fluorescence dynamics.
Sample sizes were selected based on expected variance and effect sizes from the existing literature, and no statistical methods were used to determine sample size a priori . Prior to experiments being performed, mice were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. The investigator was blinded to all behavioral studies (except for CC012 versus C57 cohorts, Figures 2 E–2G, where coat color differences prevent blinding during experimentation). Data analyses for calcium imaging ( in vitro and in vivo datasets) were automated using MATLAB scripts. Statistical tests were performed in MATLAB 2017a or Graphpad Prism 7.
Differential gene expression between high and low performing DO mice was determined in R (3.5.0) using the DESeq2. P values were determined using a Wald test and p values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method.
For analysis, the images captured by the sCMOS camera were post-processed using custom MATLAB scripts. Regions of interest were manually drawn for each fiber to extract fluorescence values throughout the experiment. The 405-nm reference trace was scaled to best fit the 470-nm signal using least-squares regression. The normalized change in fluorescence (dF/F) was calculated by subtracting the scaled 405-nm reference trace from the 470-nm signal and dividing that value by the scaled 405-nm reference trace. The true baseline of each dF/F trace was determined and corrected by using the MATLAB function “msbackadj” estimating the baseline over a 200 frame sliding window, regressing varying baseline values to the window’s data points using a spline approximation, then adjusting the baseline in the peak range of the dF/F signal. Task events (for example, delay phase and arm choices), were time stamped via video based behavioral tracking from EthoVision (Noldus) program, and behavior was video recorded as described above.
Total mean activity, for different task phases, and different strains, were quantified as area under the curve (AUC) of dF/F responses. To facilitate comparison across mice, dF/F responses were z-scored and shifted above 0. AUC was calculated using MATLAB “trapz” function and normalized with the recorded time.
Pearson Correlation of the dF/F responses was performed between different regions using the “corr” (MATLAB) function. To ensure that correlation values were significantly more than chance, each timeseries was scrambled 10,000 times randomly, for each trial across all mice. All such chance correlation coefficients were pooled to calculate mean and standard deviation of chance correlations. Correlations between different regions may also accrue due to the long responses of photometry signals reflecting bulk neural activity. To control for this, timeseries from each brain region were circularly permuted within each task phase to create an offset of 15-25 frames (selected randomly in each iteration) using the “circshift” function in MATLAB. Correlation coefficients were then calculated by repeating this step 10,000 times for each trial across all trials and mice, and compared with signal correlations.
