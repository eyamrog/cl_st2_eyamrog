Title: The Omicron variant is highly resistant against antibody-mediated neutralization: Implications for control of the COVID-19 pandemic


Abstract: Summary

The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant suggests that the virus might become globally dominant. Further, the high number of mutations in the viral spike protein raised concerns that the virus might evade antibodies induced by infection or vaccination. Here, we report that the Omicron spike was resistant against most therapeutic antibodies but remained susceptible to inhibition by sotrovimab. Similarly, the Omicron spike evaded neutralization by antibodies from convalescent patients or individuals vaccinated with the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2) with 12- to 44-fold higher efficiency than the spike of the Delta variant. Neutralization of the Omicron spike by antibodies induced upon heterologous ChAdOx1 (Astra Zeneca-Oxford)/BNT162b2 vaccination or vaccination with three doses of BNT162b2 was more efficient, but the Omicron spike still evaded neutralization more efficiently than the Delta spike. These findings indicate that most therapeutic antibodies will be ineffective against the Omicron variant and that double immunization with BNT162b2 might not adequately protect against severe disease induced by this variant.

Section: Introduction

Vaccination is considered key to ending the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. However, inequities in vaccine distribution and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants threaten this approach. Several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged in the recent year and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is currently dominating the pandemic ( Harvey et al., 2021b 25.

The biological and clinical significance of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants Nat. Rev. Genet. 2021; 22 :757-773 Crossref Scopus (633) PubMed Google Scholar ). These VOCs exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, traits that have been linked to mutations in the viral spike (S) protein ( Harvey et al., 2021b 25. Harvey, W.T. ∙ Carabelli, A.M. ∙ Jackson, B. ..., COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium SARS-CoV-2 variants, spike mutations and immune escape Nat. Rev.

The coronavirus S protein facilitates viral entry into host cells and constitutes the central target for antibodies that neutralize the virus. Mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which contains an antigenic supersite ( McCallum et al., 2021 44. McCallum, M. ∙ De Marco, A. ∙ Lempp, F.A. ...

In contrast, it is less well understood which mutations in the spike increase transmissibility and which mechanisms are responsible, although it is well established that mutation D614G increases viral transmission and promotes ACE2 engagement ( Hou et al., 2020 31.

A novel VOC, the Omicron variant (Pango lineages B.1.1.529, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3), was recently identified in South Africa, and its emergence was associated with a steep increase in cases and hospitalizations ( Abdullah, 2021 2. Abdullah, F. Tshwane District Omicron variant patient profile - early features 2021 https://www.samrc.ac.za/news/tshwane-district-omicron-variant-patient-profile-early-features Google Scholar ). The Omicron variant was imported into several European, African and Asian countries, as well as the United States via infected air travelers ( Abbasi, 2021 1. Abbasi, J. Omicron has reached the US-here's what infectious disease experts know About the variant JAMA. 2021; Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar ; Graham, 2021 18. Graham, F.

J. Infect. Dis. 2021; 114 :268-272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the United Kingdom, local transmission events were reported ( Company, 2021 13. Company, B.B. Covid: Omicron spreading in the community, Javid confirms 2021 https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59553460 Google Scholar ) with case numbers doubling every 2 to 3 days ( Torjesen, 2021 57. Torjesen, I. Covid restrictions tighten as omicron cases double every two to three days BMJ. 2021; 375 :n3051 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). The S protein of the Omicron variant harbors an unusually high number of mutations, which might increase immune evasion and/or transmissibility. Indeed, a recent study suggested that the Omicron variant is more adept at infecting convalescent individuals as compared with previously circulating variants ( Abdullah, 2021 2. Abdullah, F. Tshwane District Omicron variant patient profile - early features 2021 https://www.samrc.ac.za/news/tshwane-district-omicron-variant-patient-profile-early-features Google Scholar ; Pulliam et al., 2021 51.

Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection associated with emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Thus, the Omicron variant constitutes a rapidly emerging threat to public health and might undermine global efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the susceptibility of the Omicron variant to antibody-mediated neutralization remains to be analyzed.
Here, we report that the Omicron S protein evades antibodies with up to 44-fold higher efficiency than the spike of the Delta variant, rendering therapeutic antibodies ineffective and likely compromising protection by antibodies induced upon infection or vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 (BNT).

Section: Results

The first sequences of the Omicron variant were deposited into the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) database on November 22 and 23, 2021 ( Figure 1 A). These sequences were obtained from patients in Botswana and South Africa as well as from a traveler returning to Hong Kong from South Africa. Subsequently, the number of deposited Omicron sequences rapidly increased ( Figure 1 A) and the virus was also detected in Europe, Asia, and the United States due to infected air travelers ( Figure 1 B). Analysis of the Omicron genomic sequence revealed striking differences as compared with other known SARS-CoV-2 variants, suggesting extensive, independent evolution, potentially in an isolated human population, immunocompromised patients, or an unknown animal species ( Kupferschmidt, 2021 38. Kupferschmidt, K. Where did 'weird' Omicron come from? Science. 2021; 374 :1179 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The Omicron spike (isolate hCoV-19/Botswana/R40B58_BHP_3321001245/2021; GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_6640919) exhibits 37 mutations as compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Thirteen of these changes are unique, while the remaining changes are known from variants of interest or concern ( Haseltine, 2021 26. Haseltine, W. Understanding Omicron: changes in the spike protein and beyond and what they portend 2021 https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/12/08/omicron-the-sum-of-all-fears/?sh=2ef4182d5b51 Google Scholar ). Specifically, 11 mutations, including 6 deletions and 1 insertion, are located in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and mutations N211Δ and ins214EPE are unique. Some of the deletions are found in other VOCs and might reduce antibody binding or increase spike expression ( Harvey et al., 2021b 25.

Another 15 mutations are found in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) ( Figures 1 C–1E), of which G339D, S371L, S373P, and S375F are unique, and several were previously shown to modulate ACE2 binding and/or antibody evasion ( Harvey et al., 2021b 25.

Landscape of human antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain Cell Rep. 2021; 37 :109822 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, five mutations reside between the RBD and the S1/S2 site, including the unique mutation T547K and mutation P681H, which may modulate cleavage at the S1/S2 site by the host protease furin ( Hoffmann et al., 2020a 28. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Pöhlmann, S. A multibasic cleavage site in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for infection of human lung cells Mol.

Furin cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is modulated by O-glycosylation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Finally, five mutations are present in the S2 subunit, all of them unique ( Haseltine, 2021 26. Haseltine, W. Understanding Omicron: changes in the spike protein and beyond and what they portend 2021 https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/12/08/omicron-the-sum-of-all-fears/?sh=2ef4182d5b51 Google Scholar ).
For analysis of host-cell entry, we employed vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. These pseudotyped particles adequately mimic key features of SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells, including receptor and protease choice and neutralization by antibodies ( Hoffmann et al., 2020b 29. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ...

Riepler, L. ∙ Rössler, A. ∙ Falch, A. ... Comparison of four SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays Vaccines (Basel). 2020; 9 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmidt et al., 2020 53. Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric virusesSARS-CoV-2 J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 Crossref Google Scholar ).
We first asked whether the Omicron spike differs from the spike of other VOCs regarding target cell choice and entry efficiency. The spike from SARS-CoV-2 B.1 (which is identical to the S protein of the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, except for the presence of mutation D614G) was analyzed in parallel, since this virus circulated early in the pandemic and does not harbor mutations found in the S proteins of VOCs. For the analysis of cell tropism, we employed the cell lines Vero (African green monkey, kidney), 293T (human kidney), and A549 (human lung), which were engineered to express high levels of ACE2 (A549-ACE2), Huh-7 (human liver), Caco-2 (human colon) and Calu-3 (human lung) cells. All cell lines were highly susceptible to entry driven by VSV-G and SARS-CoV-2 B.1 spike ( Figures 1 F and S1 ). Further, all VOC S proteins facilitated robust entry into the cell lines analyzed, but subtle differences were noted. Thus, the Delta spike mediated increased entry into Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells, in keeping with published data ( Arora et al., 2021b 5. Arora, P. ∙ Sidarovich, A. ∙ Krüger, N. ... B.1.617.2 enters and fuses lung cells with increased efficiency and evades antibodies induced by infection and vaccination Cell Rep. 2021; 37 :109825 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), while the Omicron spike facilitated increased entry into Vero, Huh-7, and particularly 293T cells ( Figure 1 F). Further, B.1 and Omicron spike mediated comparable entry into A549-ACE2 cells while entry driven by the other S proteins was less efficient ( Figure 1 F). Finally, the Omicron spike bound efficiently to human ACE2 ( Figure 1 G) and used ACE2 for host-cell entry (see below), indicating that the mutations in the RBD do not compromise ACE2 interactions. In sum, the Omicron spike binds to ACE2 and mediates robust entry into diverse ACE2-positive cell lines.
We next asked whether the Omicron spike can use human ACE2 and ACE2 orthologues from different animal species, including horseshoe bat, masked palm civet, raccoon dog, and pangolin, for entry into target cells. Entry driven by the B.1 and Delta spikes as well as VSV-G served as controls. The expression of the ACE2 orthologues did not modulate entry driven by VSV-G but in most cases allowed robust and roughly comparable entry driven by the B.1, Delta, and Omicron spikes ( Figure 1 H). Two exceptions were noted. Murine ACE2 was used more efficiently by the Delta spike as compared with the B.1 spike and supported entry driven by the Omicron spike with the highest efficiency ( Figure 1 H). Further, the B.1 spike was unable to use ACE2 from Pearson’s horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus pearsonii ) for entry while the Delta and particularly the Omicron spike used this receptor with high efficiency ( Figure 1 H). Collectively, these data reveal broad usage of ACE2 orthologues by Omicron spike for host-cell entry, which might hint toward high zoonotic potential.
We next asked whether the Omicron spike can be inhibited by soluble ACE2, which binds to the RBD, blocks host-cell entry, and is currently being developed for COVID-19 therapy ( Monteil et al., 2020 46. Monteil, V. ∙ Kwon, H. ∙ Prado, P. ... Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infections in engineered human tissues using clinical-grade soluble human ACE2 Cell. 2020; 181 :905-913.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1614) PubMed Google Scholar ). Soluble ACE2 did not modulate entry driven by VSV-G but robustly and comparably inhibited entry driven by B.1, Delta, and Omicron spikes ( Figure 2 A), indicating that soluble ACE2 should be suitable for treatment of patients infected with the Omicron variant.
Several recombinant, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were identified that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and cocktails of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2, Regeneron) ( Weinreich et al., 2021 60. Weinreich, D.M. ∙ Sivapalasingam, S. ∙ Norton, T. ... REGN-COV2, a neutralizing antibody cocktail, in outpatients with Covid-19 N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384 :238-251 Crossref Scopus (1195) PubMed Google Scholar ) and etesevimab and bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly) ( Dougan et al., 2021 15. Dougan, Michael ∙ Nirula, Ajay ∙ Azizad, Masoud ... Bamlanivimab plus Etesevimab in Mild or Moderate Covid-19 N Engl J Med. 2021; 385 :1382-1392 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ) are currently used for COVID-19 therapy. In addition, the antibody sotrovimab was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses and was found to protect patients from COVID-19 ( Gupta et al., 2021 20. Gupta, A. ∙ Gonzalez-Rojas, Y. ∙ Juarez, E. ... Early treatment for Covid-19 with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody sotrovimab N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385 :1941-1950 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the Omicron spike harbors several mutations within the structures that are recognized by these antibodies ( Figure 2 B), we investigated whether the antibodies were still able to neutralize the Omicron spike. All antibodies inhibited entry driven by the B.1 spike in a robust and concentration-dependent manner, while a control immunoglobulin was inactive ( Figure 2 C). In contrast, entry driven by the Omicron spike was fully resistant against bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and imdevimab and largely resistant against casirivimab. In agreement with these findings, a cocktail of bamlanivimab and etesevimab failed to inhibit entry mediated by the Omicron spike, while inhibition by a cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab was inefficient ( Figure 2 C). In contrast, sotrovimab was active against Omicron spike, although inhibition was slightly less efficient than that measured for B.1 spike ( Figure 2 C). In sum, the Omicron spike is resistant against several antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment.
The resistance against several antibodies used for COVID-19 therapy suggested that the Omicron spike might also evade antibodies induced upon infection and vaccination. Indeed, sera/plasma collected within two months of convalescence from mild or severe COVID-19 inhibited entry driven by the Omicron spike 80-fold less efficiently as compared with the B.1 spike and 44-fold less efficiently as compared with the Delta spike, with 9 out of 17 sera tested being unable to neutralize particles bearing Omicron spike ( Figures 3 A and S2 ). The samples were collected in Germany during the first COVID-19 wave ( Table S1 ), when neither the Alpha nor the Delta variant predominated, suggesting the antibodies raised against the virus circulating at the beginning of the pandemic offer little to no protection against the Omicron variant.
The mRNA-based vaccine BNT efficiently protects against COVID-19 ( Polack et al., 2020 50. Polack, F.P. ∙ Thomas, S.J. ∙ Kitchin, N. ... Safety and efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :2603-2615 Crossref Scopus (9706) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is frequently used in Europe and the United States. Sera collected within one to three months after the second dose of BNT (10 sera were collected within 1 month, one serum was collected within 3 months; Table S2 ) inhibited entry by the Omicron spike with 34-fold lower efficiency as compared with the B.1. spike and with 12-fold lower efficiency as compared with the Delta spike ( Figures 3 B and S2 ). These results suggest that two immunizations with BNT, which can provide more than 90% protection from severe disease upon infection with the Delta variant ( Chemaitelly et al., 2021 12. Chemaitelly, H. ∙ Tang, P. ∙ Hasan, M.R. ... Waning of BNT162b2 vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qatar N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385 :e83 Crossref Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ), might be markedly less effective against the Omicron variant.
We next explored whether strategies known to increase production of neutralizing antibodies relative to BNT/BNT immunization might afford better protection against the Omicron variant. Heterologous vaccination with a first dose of ChAdO1-nCoV-19/AZD1222 (AZ) ( Voysey et al., 2021 58. Voysey, M. ∙ Clemens, S.A.C. ∙ Madhi, S.A. ... Safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2: an interim analysis of four randomised controlled trials in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK Lancet. 2021; 397 :99-111 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3326) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a second dose of BNT was shown to induce higher neutralizing antibody titers as compared with the corresponding homologous vaccinations ( Barros-Martins et al., 2021 7. Barros-Martins, J. ∙ Hammerschmidt, S.I. ∙ Cossmann, A. ... Immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants after heterologous and homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2 vaccination Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1525-1529 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ; Behrens et al., 2021 8. Behrens, G.M. ∙ Cossmann, A. ∙ Stankov, M.V. ... SARS-CoV-2 delta variant neutralisation after heterologous ChAdOx1-S/BNT162b2 vaccination Lancet. 2021; 398 :1041-1042 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sera collected within one month after heterologous AZ/BNT vaccination ( Table S2 ) exhibited higher neutralizing activity as compared with sera collected within three months after BNT/BNT vaccination ( Figure 3 C). Inhibition of Omicron-spike-driven entry by sera from AZ/BNT-vaccinated individuals was 14-fold less efficient as compared to B.1. spike but only 3-fold less efficient relative to Delta spike ( Figure 3 C). Further, inhibition of the Omicron spike by sera collected within one month of AZ/BNT vaccination was comparable with inhibition of the Delta spike by sera obtained within three months after BNT/BNT vaccination ( Figures 3 B and 3C), a time interval during which the vaccine provides more than 90% protection from severe COVID-19.
A third immunization with BNT increases protection against infection by 10-fold as compared to two doses of BNT ( Bar-On et al., 2021 6. Bar-On, Y.M. ∙ Goldberg, Y. ∙ Mandel, M. ... Protection against Covid-19 by BNT162b2 booster across age groups N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar ). Sera from BNT/BNT/BNT-immunized donors collected within one month after the third dose ( Table S2 ) had slightly higher neutralizing titers as sera obtained within the same time interval from donors immunized with AZ/BNT ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Sera from BNT/BNT/BNT-immunized individuals inhibited entry driven by the Omicron spike with 8-fold reduced efficiency as compared with the B.1 spike and 2-fold reduced efficiency as compared with the Delta spike ( Figure 3 D). Further, inhibition of Omicron spike by sera collected within one month after BNT/BNT/BNT immunization was moderately more efficient as compared with inhibition of the Delta spike by sera obtained within three months after BNT/BNT vaccination ( Figures 3 B and 3D). These results suggest that heterologous AZ/BNT as well as homologous BNT/BNT/BNT immunization might provide better protection against the Omicron variant as compared to BNT/BNT immunization.

Section: Discussion

The emergence, rapid spread, and international dissemination of the highly mutated Omicron variant raised concerns that this variant might soon become globally dominant and that several therapeutic or preventive interventions might be ineffective against this variant. The present study indicates that several of these concerns are justified. The S protein of the Omicron variant evaded antibody-mediated neutralization with higher efficiency than any previously analyzed S proteins of variants of interest and VOCs. It was not appreciably inhibited by two antibody cocktails used for COVID-19 therapy and inhibition by antibodies induced by two immunizations with BNT was strongly reduced as compared with the spike of the Delta variant. Heterologous vaccinations and a BNT booster shot induced appreciable levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron spike and might offer some protection against this variant. Nevertheless, our tools available to contain SARS-CoV-2 might require expansion and adaptation in order to efficiently combat the Omicron variant.
The findings that the Omicron spike facilitated efficient entry into several human cell lines and robustly bound human ACE2 suggest that the Omicron variant readily infects human cells. Nevertheless, some peculiarities of host cell entry driven by the Omicron spike relative to the B.1 spike were noted. The Omicron spike mediated slightly but significantly augmented entry into cell lines which only allow for cathepsin L-(293T, Huh-7, A549-ACE2) but not TMPRSS2-dependent entry, due to low or absent TMPRSS2 expression ( Hoffmann et al., 2020b 29.

We previously observed a similar phenotype for the S protein of another African SARS-CoV-2 lineage, A.30 ( Arora et al., 2021a 4. Arora, P. ∙ Rocha, C. ∙ Kempf, A. ... The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variant A.30 is heavily mutated and evades vaccine-induced antibodies with high efficiency Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2021; 18 :2673-2675 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the mutations in the spike responsible for this phenotype remain to be determined. Further, the Omicron spike used ACE2 proteins from different animal species with high efficiency for entry. The efficient usage of murine ACE2 is in keeping with the presence of the mutations K417N and N501Y, which can also emerge upon SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to experimentally infected mice ( Huang et al., 2021 32.

SARS-CoV-2 rapidly adapts in aged BALB/c mice and induces typical pneumonia J. Virol. 2021; 95 Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar ). In addition, the Omicron spike harbors mutations Q493R and Q498R, which are related to exchanges Q493K and Q498H, which were also detected in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 ( Huang et al., 2021 32. Huang, K. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Hui, X. ... Q493K and Q498H substitutions in Spike promote adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in mice EBioMedicine. 2021; 67 :103381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sun et al., 2021 55.

SARS-CoV-2 rapidly adapts in aged BALB/c mice and induces typical pneumonia J. Virol. 2021; 95 Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar ). However, some of these mutations are present in other VOCs and cannot be taken as evidence that the Omicron variant may have evolved in infected mice in the wild. In addition, the Omicron spike was able to use ACE2 from the Pearson’s horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus pearsonii ) with high efficiency. Again, this finding does not indicate that the Omicron variant infects these animals (which are found in Asia) in the wild but rather reflects the ability of the Omicron spike to use diverse ACE2 orthologues for entry. Collectively, our results suggest that the mutations in the Omicron spike are compatible with robust usage of diverse ACE2 orthologues for entry and might thus have broadened the ability of the Omicron variant to infect animal species.
Cocktails of the antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab as well as etesevimab and bamlanivimab are used for COVID-19 therapy. Entry driven by the Omicron spike was fully or largely resistant against each of these antibodies and against the antibody cocktails, most likely due to the mutations K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, and Y505H, which are located within or close to the epitopes bound by these antibodies ( Figure 2 B). Thus, two frequently used COVID-19 treatment options will not be available to combat the Omicron variant. In contrast, sotrovimab, a pan-sarbecovirus-neutralizing antibody ( Gupta et al., 2021 20. Gupta, A. ∙ Gonzalez-Rojas, Y. ∙ Juarez, E. ... Early treatment for Covid-19 with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody sotrovimab N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385 :1941-1950 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ), remained active against the Omicron spike, in keeping with sotrovimab recognizing an epitope not substantially altered by mutations found in the Omicron spike ( Figure 2 B). Finally, soluble ACE2 robustly blocked entry driven by the Omicron spike and might be an option for treatment of patients infected with the Omicron variant.
Studies conducted before the emergence of the Omicron variant indicated that convalescent COVID-19 patients are efficiently protected against reinfection and antibody responses likely play an important role in protection ( Addetia et al., 2020 3. Addetia, A. ∙ Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Dingens, A. ... Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 in humans during a fishery vessel outbreak with a high attack rate J. Clin.

Med. 2021; 384 :533-540 Crossref Scopus (640) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings with serum/plasma samples collected in Germany during the first wave of the pandemic indicate that this high level of protection might not apply to reinfection with the Omicron variant. Thus, neutralization of the Omicron spike was 80-fold less efficient as compared with controls and several sera did not exert neutralizing activity. Although neutralization by sera from patients infected with the Delta variant remains to be examined, it is likely that convalescent patients might not be adequately protected against symptomatic reinfection with the Omicron variant, in keeping with recent data ( Pulliam et al., 2021 51. Pulliam, J.R.C. ∙ van Schalkwyk, C. ∙ Govender, N. ... Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection associated with emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Neutralizing antibody responses are also believed to be critical for protection against COVID-19 by BNT vaccination ( Corbett et al., 2021 14. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Nason, M.C. ∙ Flach, B. ... Immune correlates of protection by mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates Science. 2021; 373 :eabj0299 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Feng et al., 2021 16.

Immune correlates analysis of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy clinical trial Science. 2021; eab3435 Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar ). We found that antibodies induced upon BNT/BNT immunization neutralized the Omicron spike with 34-fold reduced efficiency as compared with B.1. Therefore, two doses of BNT might not provide robust protection against severe disease induced by the Omicron variant and adaptation of the vaccine to the new variant seems required. In the meantime, heterologous AZ/BNT vaccination or a BNT booster (BNT/BNT/BNT) might afford some protection against the Omicron variant, since sera from individuals who had received the respective vaccinations neutralized the Omicron spike with appreciable efficiency. However, it remains to be determined whether this protection is transient or long lasting.
Our study has several limitations, including the analysis of a limited number of sera/plasma collected within 3 months after vaccination and use of pseudotyped virus instead of authentic SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, which was not available to us. Further, T cell responses were not determined in our study. However, given the important role that antibodies play in immune protection against SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that antibody cocktails used for therapy and likely also vaccines must be adapted for efficient protection against the Omicron variant. While such adaptations are in progress, heterologous or booster immunizations could help to limit the impact of the Omicron variant on public health, and conventional control measures like face masks and social distancing should be maintained.

Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (GIBCO) while A549-ACE2 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (GIBCO). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom) and 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (PAA). Further, media for Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells were supplemented with 1x non-essential amino acid solution (from 100x stock, PAA) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO). Cell lines were validated by STR-typing, amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase gene, microscopic examination and/or according to their growth characteristics. In addition, all cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination. For transfection of 293T cells, the calcium-phosphate based method was applied, while BHK-21 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The expression vector for the Omicron spike (based on isolate hCoV-19/Botswana/R40B58_BHP_3321001245/2021; GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_6640919) was generated by Gibson assembly using five overlapping DNA strings (Thermo Fisher Scientific, sequences available upon request), linearized (BamHI/XbaI digest) pCG1 plasmid and GeneArt™ Gibson Assembly HiFi Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gibson assembly was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. The pCG1 vector was kindly provided by Roberto Cattaneo (Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA). To generate expression plasmids for different ACE2 orthologues (harboring a C-terminal cMYC-epitope tag) the respective sequences were amplified from existing plasmids (human, pangolin, cat, masked palm civet and red fox, Rhinolophus landeri ACE2) ( Hoffmann et al. , 2021b 30.

Expression plasmids for pangolin, masked palm civet and red fox ACE2 used as templates for cloning were kindly provided by Zhaohui Qian (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China). ACE2 open reading frames were inserted into the pQCXIP expression vector making use of NotI and PacI restriction sites. The integrity of all expression plasmids was confirmed using a commercial sequencing service (Microsynth SeqLab).
S protein sequences and information on collection date and global distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates belonging to the Omicron variant were obtained from the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) database ( https://www.gisaid.org ). Structural models of the S protein were generated using YASARA software ( http://www.yasara.org/index.html ) and are based on a template that was constructed by modelling the SARS-2 S sequence on PDB: 6XR8 ( Cai et al., 2020 11. Cai, Y. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Xiao, T. ... Distinct conformational states of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Science. 2020; 369 :1586-1592 Crossref Scopus (734) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the SWISS-MODEL online tool ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org ). Alternatively, the following published crystal structures were employed; PDB: 6XDG ( Hansen et al., 2020 23. Hansen, J. ∙ Baum, A. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ...

Rhabdoviral pseudotypes harboring SARS-CoV-2 S protein were produced as described ( Kleine-Weber et al., 2019 34. Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Elzayat, M.T. ∙ Wang, L. ... Mutations in the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmitted in Korea increase resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization J. Virol. 2019; 93 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for SARS-CoV-2 S protein, VSV-G or empty plasmid (control). At 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with at an MOI of 3 with a replication-deficient reporter VSV, termed VSV∗ΔG-FLuc ( Berger Rentsch and Zimmer, 2011 9. Berger Rentsch, M. ∙ Zimmer, G. A vesicular stomatitis virus replicon-based bioassay for the rapid and sensitive determination of multi-species type I interferon PLoS One. 2011; 6 :e25858 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). This virus lacks the ORF for VSV-G and codes for enhanced green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase (FLuc). After 1 h of incubation, the input virus was removed and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Thereafter, culture medium containing anti-VSV-G antibody (culture supernatant from I1-hybridoma cells; ATCC no. CRL-2700) was added in order to neutralize residual inpunt virus. For cells expressing VSV-G, culture medium without antibody was added. After 16-18 h, the culture supernatant was harvested, separated from cellular debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 x g at room temperature (RT), and the clarified supernatants were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C.
For analysis of S protein-driven cell entry, target cells were seeded in 96-well plates. In case of experiments addressing S protein usage of different ACE2 orthologues as receptor, cells were transfected with the respective ACE2 expression plasmids or empty vector. At 24 h post seeding (or transfection), the culture medium was removed and cells were inoculated with equal volumes of pseudotype preparations. At 16-18 h post inoculation, pseudotype entry was quantified by measuring the activity of virus-encoded luciferase in cell lysates. For this, cells were lysed using PBS supplemented with 0.5% triton X-100 (Carl Roth) for 30 min at RT. Subsequently, cell lysates were transferred into white 96-well plates, mixed with luciferase substrate (Beetle- Juice, PJK) and luminescence measured with a Hidex Sense Plate luminometer (Hidex).
The production of soluble ACE2 fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin has been previously described in detail ( Hoffmann et al., 2021b 30. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Krüger, N. ... SARS-CoV-2 mutations acquired in mink reduce antibody-mediated neutralization Cell Rep. 2021; 35 :109017 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to test binding of soluble ACE2 to the S protein, 293T cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with S protein expression plasmids or empty plasmid as negative control. At 24 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium. At 48 h posttransfection, the culture medium was aspirated and cells resuspended in PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 600 x g for 5 min. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA, PBS-B) and pelleted again. Next, the cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μl PBS-B containing soluble ACE2-Fc (1:100 dilution of 100x concentrated stock) and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C, employing a Rotospin test tube rotator disk (IKA). Thereafter, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 250 μl PBS-B containing anti-human AlexaFlour-488-conjugated antibody (1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated again for 60 min at 4 °C. After a final wash step with PBS-B, the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min at RT, washed, resuspended in 150 μl PBS-B and analyzed by flow cytometry, using an LSR II flow cytometer and the FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). The collected data were then analyzed using the Flowing software version 2.5.1 ( https://bioscience.fi/services/cell-imaging/flowing-software/ ).
S protein (or VSV-G) bearing particles were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with different dilutions of soluble ACE2 (undiluted, 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000). After incubation, the mixtures were added to Vero cells. Particles exposed to medium without soluble ACE2 served as control. Transduction efficiency was determined at 16-18 h postinoculation by determining luciferase activities in cell lysates, as described above.
Convalescent plasma/serum was obtained from COVID-19 patients treated at the University Medicine Göttingen (UMG) or Hannover Medical school (MHH). Sera from individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2/BNT162b2 (BNT/BNT), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2 (AZ/BNT) or BNT162b2/BNT162b2/BNT162b2 (BNT/BNT/BNT) were collected 14-72 days after receiving the last (second or third) dose at UMG or MHH (specific details on the samples can be found in Table S1 ). All serum and plasma samples were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. Collection of samples was approved by the ethic committee of the UMG (reference number: 8/9/20 and SeptImmun Study 25/4/19 Ü) and the Institutional Review Board of MHH (8973_BO_K_2020).
For neutralization experiments, S protein bearing particles were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Casirivimab, Imdevimab, Bamlanivimab, Etesevimab, Casirivimab + Imdevimab, Bamlanivimab + Etesevimab, Sotrovimab or unrelated control human IgG (5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, 0.0005 μg/ml). Alternatively, pseudotyped particles were pre-incubated with different dilutions of convalescent or vaccinated plasma/serum (dilution range: 1:25 to 1:12,800). After incubation, the mixtures were added to Vero cells. Particles exposed to medium without antibodies served as control. Transduction efficiency was determined at 16-18 h postinoculation by determining luciferase activities in cell lysates, as described above.
The results on S protein-driven cell entry represent average (mean) data acquired from three to twelve biological replicates, each conducted with four technical replicates. The transduction was normalized against SARS-CoV-2 S B.1 (= 1). Alternatively, transduction was normalized against the background signal (luminescence measured for cells inoculated with particles bearing no viral glycoprotein; set as 1). For ACE2 binding, presented are the average (mean) geometric mean channel fluorescence data from six biological replicates, each conducted with single samples. The results on neutralization of S protein-driven cell entry by monoclonal antibodies and control IgG represent average (mean) data from three biological replicates (each conducted with technical quadruplicates) for which transduction was normalized against samples that did not contain any antibody (= 0% inhibition). The results on inhibition of S protein-driven cell entry by soluble ACE2 represent average (mean) data from three biological replicates (each conducted with technical quadruplicates) for which transduction was normalized against samples that did not contain soluble ACE2 (= 0% inhibition). The results on neutralization of spike protein-driven cell entry by convalescent plasma/serum or serum from vaccinated individuals are based on a single experiment, which was conducted with technical quadruplicates. For data normalization, the plasma/serum dilution factor that leads to 50% reduction in S protein-driven cell entry (neutralizing titer 50, NT50) was calculated. In addition, for each plasma/serum the fold change in NT50 between the indicated SARS-CoV-2 variants was calculated.
Error bars are defined as either standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel (as part of the Microsoft Office software package, version 2019, Microsoft Corporation) and GraphPad Prism 8 version 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t-test with Welch correction (pseudotype entry, ACE2 binding), two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s or Sidak’s post-hoc test (soluble ACE2 inhibition, and monoclonal antibody neutralization) or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (serum/plasma neutralization). Only p-values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant (p > 0.05, not significant [ns]; p ≤ 0.05, ∗ ; p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗ ; p ≤ 0.001, ∗∗∗ ). Details on the statistical test and the error bars can be found in the figure legends.
