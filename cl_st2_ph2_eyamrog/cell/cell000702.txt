Title: A mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping and its inhibition by nucleotide analog inhibitors


Abstract: Summary

Decoration of cap on viral RNA plays essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. Here, we report a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping and document structural details at atomic resolution. The NiRAN domain in polymerase catalyzes the covalent link of RNA 5′ end to the first residue of nsp9 (termed as RNAylation), thus being an intermediate to form cap core (GpppA) with GTP catalyzed again by NiRAN. We also reveal that triphosphorylated nucleotide analog inhibitors can be bonded to nsp9 and fit into a previously unknown “Nuc-pocket” in NiRAN, thus inhibiting nsp9 RNAylation and formation of GpppA. S-loop (residues 50-KTN-52) in NiRAN presents a remarkable conformational shift observed in RTC bound with sofosbuvir monophosphate, reasoning an “induce-and-lock” mechanism to design inhibitors. These findings not only improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping and the mode of action of NAIs but also provide a strategy to design antiviral drugs.

Section: Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, COVID-19 has caused over 585 million infections and over 6.4 million deaths worldwide ( WHO, 2020 46. WHO WHO coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dashboard https://covid19.who.int/ Date: 2020 Google Scholar ). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) to assemble the replication-transcription complex (RTC) for replicating and transcribing viral RNAs ( Lou and Rao, 2022 23.

The positive-sense RNAs (mRNA and genomic RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 bear a 5′ cap(1) structure ( 7Me GpppA 2’OMe ) ( Bouvet et al., 2010 3. Bouvet, M. ∙ Debarnot, C. ∙ Imbert, I. ...

The decoration of cap(1) resembles mRNAs generated by the host cell and plays essential roles in promoting initiation of translation, protecting the mRNAs and helping the virus escape host immune recognition ( Daffis et al., 2010 10. Daffis, S. ∙ Szretter, K.J. ∙ Schriewer, J. ... 2′-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap evades host restriction by IFIT family members Nature. 2010; 468 :452-456 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The co-transcriptional capping of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs has been previously shown to occur by a four-step sequential reaction in RTCs. First, a 5′ RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) activity in the viral helicase, nsp13, removes the γ-phosphate of the 5′-triphosphate end (pppA) of the nascent RNAs to generate the 5′-diphosphate end (ppA) ( Ivanov et al., 2004 17.

Virol. 2004; 78 :7833-7838 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, the N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain in viral polymerase, nsp12, acts as a guanylyltransferase (GTase) to transfer a GMP to ppA to yield the cap core (GpppA) ( Walker et al., 2021 42.

In the last two steps, an N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) in nsp14 and a 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) in nsp16 sequentially methylates GpppA to cap(0) ( 7Me GpppA) and cap(1) ( 7Me GpppA 2’OMe ), thereby finalizing the capping actions ( Bouvet et al., 2010 3.

Virol. 2008; 82 :8071-8084 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nsp9, a virally encoded nonstructural protein, has been shown to bind to nsp12 NiRAN and play essential roles in RNA capping ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ...

Nsp9 not only impacts on the enzymatic activity of nsp12 NiRAN but also plays a key role as an adaptor to recruit nsp10/14 or nsp10/16 into RTCs to constitute the co-transcriptional capping complexes (CCCs) for the third or final capping actions ( Yan et al., 2021a 47.

Further studies have shown that the attenuation of the activity of nsp12 NiRAN by nsp9 is due to the additional N-terminal residues acquired from the expression plasmid, although these additional residues do not affect the binding of nsp9 to nsp12 NiRAN ( Slanina et al., 2021 37. Slanina, H. ∙ Madhugiri, R. ∙ Bylapudi, G. ... Coronavirus replication–transcription complex: vital and selective NMPylation of a conserved site in nsp9 by the NiRAN-RdRp subunit Proc. Natl. Acad.

NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :8822-8835 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, nsp9 has also been reported to be NMPylated by nsp12 NiRAN, thus priming the synthesis of viral RNA ( Shannon et al., 2022 36. Shannon, A. ∙ Fattorini, V. ∙ Sama, B. ... A dual mechanism of action of AT-527 against SARS-CoV-2 polymerase Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :621 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Slanina et al., 2021 37.

NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :8822-8835 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we report an alternative mechanism of RNA capping facilitated by nsp12 NiRAN and nsp9, contrasting with the mechanism proposed for the nsp13/nsp12/nsp14/nsp16 enzymes. Our structural studies show here that nsp12 NiRAN catalyzes a reaction to remove pyrophosphate (PPi) from the 5′ end of the RNA and subsequently forms a covalent bond between the remaining α-phosphate with the first asparagine residue of nsp9 ( nsp9 N1), a step termed as RNAylation. The RNAylated nsp9 is further used as an intermediate to generate GpppA with a GTP molecule bound in the so-called “G-pocket,” again catalyzed by nsp12 NiRAN. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN covalently bonds nucleotide analog inhibitors (NAIs), remdesivir, sofosbuvir, molnupiravir, and AT-9010 (the prodrug is AT-527), to nsp9 N1 and locate them in previously undescribed pocket we refer to as the “Nuc-pocket.” As a result, RNAylation of nsp9 and formation of GpppA is inhibited. The structures of RTC in complex with the RNAylated nsp9 and further with GMPPNP or GTP, as well as in complex with GMPPNP and nsp9 decorated by the monophosphorylated remdesivir (RMP), sofosbuvir (SMP), molnupiravir (MMP), or AT-9010 (ATMP), have also been determined. These structures not only provide insights to improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping and the mechanism for NAI action but also suggest an “induce-and-lock” mechanism that can be utilized for the development of antiviral inhibitors targeting the process of RNA capping.

Section: Results

The incubation of an RdRp-defective nsp12 mutant (S759A-nsp12), with nsp9 and a 10-nt RNA derived from 5′ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genome (5′-pppAUUAAAGGUU-3′), resulted in an upward migration of the apo nsp9 (apo-nsp9) band on SDS-PAGE in a time-dependent manner ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). This band was isolated, and mass spectrometry showed it has a molecular weight (MW) of 15,609 Da ( Figures 1 B and S1 B). Considering the MWs of the RNA (3,410 Da) and apo-nsp9 (12,378 Da), the change of mass (3,410 + 12,378 − 15,609 Da = 179 Da) shows the RNA is covalently bonded to nsp9 and with the loss of PPi (178 Da). We term this modification of nsp9 by the RNA as RNAylation. The RNAylation of nsp9 is strongly dependent on the presence of Mn 2+ ( Figure 1 A). In the presence of Mg 2+ , only weak activity was observed, whereas no activity was detected in the presence of Ca 2+ .
When the RNAylated nsp9 (RNA-nsp9) and S759A-nsp12 were incubated with [α- 32 P]GTP in the presence of Mg 2+ , a signal corresponding to the radioactively labeled GpppA-RNA was detected ( Figures 1 C, S1 C, and S1D). The formation of GpppA-RNA is not dependent on Mn 2+ , which is in contrast to the Mn 2+ -dependency of the RNAylation of nsp9. Because the nsp12 used in these studies is an RdRp-defective mutant, the results indicate nsp12 NiRAN can catalyze the RNAylation of nsp9 and the formation of GpppA using RNA-nsp9 and GTP. Furthermore, the GpppA formed by RNA-nsp9 and GTP can be further modified by nsp14 and nsp16 to yield cap(0) ( 7Me GpppA) and cap(1) ( 7Me GpppA 2’OMe ), suggesting nsp9 RNAylation mediates a pathway for SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping ( Figure 1 D).
To dissect the mechanisms for the RNAylation of nsp9 and the formation of GpppA, we purified RNA-nsp9 and determined the cryo-EM structures of the elongation RTC (E-RTC, composed by nsp7-nsp8 2 -nsp12-nsp13 2 ) in complex with RNA-nsp9 and subsequently with GMPPNP (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog) at 2.75 and 2.66 Å, respectively ( Figures 1 E, 2 , and 3 ; Table S1 ).
In the structure of E-RTC:RNA-nsp9, RNA-nsp9 binds to nsp12 NiRAN, which is in agreement with the previously reported structures of SARS-CoV-2 RTCs that also include apo-nsp9 ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of an extended SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex reveals an intermediate state in cap synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2021b 48. Yan, L. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Li, M. ... Coupling of N7-methyltransferase and 3′-5′ exoribonuclease with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase reveals mechanisms for capping and proofreading Cell. 2021; 184 :3474-3485.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). The N-terminal three residues of nsp9 insert into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN ( Figure 2 A). The first two nucleotides of the RNA, A+1 and U+2, are identified in the density ( Figure 2 B). The other nucleotides are not observed, possibly because they are in a flexible conformation due to a lack of interaction with the RTC proteins.
The α-phosphorus of the A+1 nucleotide is ∼1.6 Å from the backbone nitrogen of the first asparagine residue of nsp9 ( nsp9 N1), indicating a phospho-amide covalent bond links the RNA and nsp9 ( Figure 2 C). The base and the ribose of A+1 bind in a cavity surrounded by the anti-parallel strands β2-β3 in nsp12 NiRAN and rest on a hydrophobic base consisting of the side chains of nsp12 F35/I37/F48 ( Figures 2 D and S2 A). The base of A+1 forms hydrogen bonds with nsp12 N39 in nsp12 NiRAN and with nsp12 N713 in nsp12 Palm. The side chain of nsp9 N1 is also involved in the interaction with the base of A+1. Henceforth, we term this pocket as the “Nuc-pocket.” The second nucleotide, U+2, extends outward from the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN. The base of U+2 stacks parallel with the base of A+1. The side chains of nsp12 K41 in nsp12 NiRAN and nsp12 N713 in nsp12 Palm contact with the base of U+2, whereas nsp12 K50 and nsp12 T51/N52 bond with the α-phosphate and the ribose of U+2. Two Mn 2+ ions are chelated by the side chains of nsp12 D208/N209/D218 and coordinate with three solvent molecules in the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN ( Figure 2 E). Two water molecules form a bridge linking Mn(1) and the side chain of nsp12 R116. The distances of two Mn 2+ to the α-phosphate of A+1 are both around 4.0 Å ( Figure 2 E, red dashes).
For mutagenesis studies, we selected five residues which have close contacts with Mn 2+ or the RNA and substituted them to alanine to verify their contributions to the RNAylation of nsp9 ( Figure 2 F). SDS-PAGE shows the substitutions of nsp12 R116, nsp12 D208, nsp12 N209, and nsp12 D218 to alanine abolishes the RNAylation of nsp9, confirming their essential roles in coordinating Mn 2+ . The mutation of nsp12 N39, which contacts with the base of A+1, also significantly attenuates nsp9 RNAylation, although a weak band corresponding to RNA-nsp9 could still be observed, indicating the stabilization of the RNA is also important for the RNAylation of nsp9.
In the structure of E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP, four nucleotides are identified ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S2 B, S3 A, and S3B). The first nucleotide, A+1, binds in the Nuc-pocket, similar to that observed in E-RTC:RNA-nsp9 ( Figures 3 C and S3 C). The second nucleotide, U+2, has a ∼90° rotation around its α-phosphate group and is shifted upward 2.5 Å compared with its position in E-RTC:RNA-nsp9 ( Figure S3 C). The conformation shift of U+2 leads to the loss of contact of its uracil base with the side chain of nsp12 N713, but it does form an interaction (distance 3.2 Å) with the carbonyl oxygen of nsp12 L49 ( Figure 3 C). The hydroxyl group of nsp12 T51 side chain also participates in an interaction with the α-phosphate of U+2, together with nsp12 K50/N52, but does not contact with the ribose. The third and the fourth nucleotides, U+3 and A+4, run anti-parallel with respect to A+1 ( Figure 3 D). The base groups of U+3 and A+4 point toward the catalytic center. The base of U+3 is clamped by the base groups of A+1 and A+4. U+3 does not make contact with the RTC proteins. The base and the ribose of A+4 contact with nsp12 R74/T76/N79, whereas the base of A+4 is clamped by the side chain of nsp12 H75 and U+3.
A GMPPNP molecule binds to nsp12 NiRAN ( Figures 3 E, S2 B, S3 A, and S3B). The base and the ribose of GMPPNP are buried in a deep pocket, which is formed by the residues from β2-β3 and β4-β5 of nsp12 NiRAN. Henceforth, we term this region as the “G-pocket.” In the G-pocket, the carbonyl oxygens of nsp12 T120 and nsp12 K121 make interactions with the nucleobase of GMPPNP. The side chain nitrogen atom of nsp12 R55 also interacts with the hydroxyl of the base, whereas nsp12 V31/K50/C53/Y69/V71/Y122/T123/Y217 form a relatively hydrophobic environment to surround and stabilize GMPPNP.
The binding of AT-527 diphosphate (ATDP) and GTP in the G-pocket has been observed in two previous studies ( Malone et al., 2022 24. Malone, B.F. ∙ Perry, J.K. ∙ Olinares, P.D.B. ... Structural basis for substrate selection by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Shannon et al., 2022 36. Shannon, A. ∙ Fattorini, V. ∙ Sama, B. ... A dual mechanism of action of AT-527 against SARS-CoV-2 polymerase Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :621 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). As the coordinates for GTP binding in G-pocket were not available when this work was submitted, we compared it with the binding of ATDP in the G-pocket ( Figure S3 D). The base, the ribose, and the α-/β-phosphates of ATDP are in similar positions as GMPPNP, whereas a Mg 2+ ligates with ATDP, occupying the position of the γ-phosphate in GMPPNP. The catalytic residues nsp12 D208/N209/D218 are in the same conformation in both structures. Since AT-527/AT-9010 is a guanosine analog, the similarity with the binding of ATDP and GMPPNP in the G-pocket is expected. It is also noteworthy that nsp12 R55 and nsp12 Y217, two conserved residues across the α- and β- coronavirus clades, have previously been suggested to provide base specificity for guanosine ( Malone et al., 2022 24. Malone, B.F. ∙ Perry, J.K. ∙ Olinares, P.D.B. ... Structural basis for substrate selection by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Three phosphate groups of GMPPNP bind at the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN in a space clamped by nsp12 Y217 and nsp12 D221 ( Figures 3 F and S2 B). The α-phosphate of GMPPNP is stabilized by the positively charged side chains of nsp12 K73 and nsp12 R116. The β-phosphate forms interactions with nsp12 D208 and nsp12 N209, whereas the γ-phosphate contacts with the side chain of nsp12 D221 and the backbone nitrogen of nsp12 G220, and the side chain of nsp12 D218 is located in the central of three phosphates and forms interactions with them.
A Mg 2+ ligates (distances ∼2.6 Å) with the phosphoryl oxygens of the α- and γ-phosphates of GMPPNP ( Figure 3 F, red dashes). An interesting observation is that the β-/γ-phosphates of GMPPNP occupy the positions that bind the two Mn 2+ in the structure of E-RTC:RNA-nsp9 ( Figure S3 E). In the context that the RNAylation of nsp9 is dependent on Mn 2+ , but the formation of GpppA is not, this structural observation suggests that the β-/γ-phosphates of GTP may compete with the Mn 2+ prior the subsequent catalytic reaction for GpppA formation.
We have also determined the structure of E-RTC in complex with RNA-nsp9 and GTP in the presence of Ca 2+ at 3.39 Å (Table S1). Structural comparison showed that GTP binds in the G-pocket with a generally similar conformation as GMPPNP, but the orientation of β-/γ-phosphates varies ( Figure S4 A). The densities for the nucleotides are largely not visible and only poor density corresponding to the ribose of A+1 remains ( Figure S4 B), suggesting the reaction still occurs. We assume the non-hydrolyzable P-N bond between β-/γ-phosphates in GMPPNP helps to stabilize the conformation of RTC, thus resulting in the significantly higher resolution. Because of the higher resolution of E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP, as well as the similar conformation of GTP and GMPPNP in the G-pocket, we used GMPPNP for structural analysis in this study.
We next mutated five residues in nsp12 NiRAN to alanine and verified their importance on the formation of GpppA ( Figure 3 G). Residue nsp12 R55 is in G-pocket and interacts with the base of GMPPNP, nsp12 K73 contacts with the α-phosphate of GMPPNP, whereas nsp12 D208/N209/D218 are the catalytic residues. Among them, the mutation on R55 showed a significant decrease in the yield of GpppA, similar to the substitutions of the catalytic residues nsp12 D208 and nsp12 D218, suggesting the stabilization of the base of GMPPNP in the G-pocket is essential for reaction to occur. In contrast, the mutants, nsp12 K73A and nsp12 N209A, exhibit minimal effects on GpppA formation.
The incubation of nsp9 with the triphosphorylated NAIs (NAI-TP) and nsp12 resulted in a covalent bond between the NAIs and nsp9 ( Figures S5 A–S5D). We selected the triphosphorylated forms of remdesivir (RTP), sofosbuvir (STP), molnupiravir (MTP), and AT-9010 (ATTP) in this study, representing analogs of A/U/C/G, respectively. The structures show all four NAI-TPs bonded to nsp9 with catalysis due to the presence of nsp12. Mass spectrometry validated the formation of covalent bonding of the NAIs with nsp9. The MWs for the four reaction products are 12,732, 12,701, 12,700, and 12,739 Da, which correspond to the MW of apo-nsp9 (12,378 Da) with RTP (531 Da), STP (500 Da), MTP (499 Da), and ATTP (539 Da) added and a PPi (178 Da) subtracted. In summary, these results show that PPi is released from NAI-TPs and their monophosphorylated forms (RMP, SMP, MMP, and ATMP) are covalently bonded to nsp9.
When the 10-nt RNA derived SARS-CoV-2 genome 5′ UTR was incubated with nsp12 and the purified RMP-/SMP-/MMP-/ATMP-nsp9, the RNA cannot be decorated to nsp9 by replacing RMP, SMP, MMP, and ATMP ( Figure S5 E). Moreover, the incubation of RMP-/SMP-/MMP-/ATMP-nsp9 with nsp12 and GTP does not break the covalent bonds between NAI-MP and nsp9, prohibiting the removal of RMP/SMP/MMP/ATMP from the NAI-decorated nsp9 ( Figure S5 F). These results suggest that the covalent bonds between NAI-MP and nsp9 N1 cannot be broken in nsp12 NiRAN and the N terminus of nsp9 cannot be released in the presence of the substrates for nsp9 RNAylation and GpppA formation, thus preventing RNAylation of nsp9 and subsequent GpppA formation.
To dissect the mechanism for the NAI-inhibition of nsp9 RNAylation and GpppA formation, we determined the structure of E-RTC in complex with purified RMP-nsp9, SMP-nsp9, MMP-nsp9, or ATMP-nsp9 in the presence of GMPPNP at resolutions of 2.72, 3.37, 2.64, and 3.38 Å, respectively ( Figures 4 A–4D and S2 C–S2E; Table S2 ).
In all four structures, GMPPNP is observed in the G-pocket, but the binding modes of the NAI-MPs in the Nuc-pocket is variable ( Figures 4 A–4H). In the Nuc-pocket, the densities for SMP and RMP are well defined, and the density for MMP is also visible. In sharp contrast, the density corresponding to ATMP linked with nsp9 N1 is not observed, although mass spectrometry confirmed that the decoration of ATMP to nsp9 had occurred. We reason the lack of ATMP density is due to the loss of contact with RTC proteins. In addition, we also determined the structure of E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GTP and have shown that GTP binds to the G-pocket in a similar mode as GMPPNP, as expected ( Figure S4 C; Table S2).
The loop region constituted by residues 50-KNT-52 exhibits a conformational change with a downward rotation of ∼180° in the structure of E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GMPPNP, compared with structures with RMP-/MMP-/ATMP-nsp9 or RNA-nsp9 or apo-nsp9 ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of an extended SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex reveals an intermediate state in cap synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ) bound ( Figures 4 A-4D, S4 F, and S4G). As the fluoro modification and the hydroxyl group on the ribose of SMP contacts with this loop region ( Figure 4 I), we speculate the interaction between nsp12 NiRAN with the chemical modification on the ribose of SMP leads to this conformational change. As SMP is an analog of UMP, we therefore determined the structures of E-RTC:UMP-nsp9 and E-RTC:UMP-nsp9:GMPPNP at 3.31 and 3.82 Å to verify this hypothesis ( Figures S4 H–S4K; Table S1).
In the structure of E-RTC:UMP-nsp9, UMP is linked with nsp9 N1 and the loop 50-KNT-52 in an upward conformation ( Figures S4 H and S4J), suggesting that the conformational change of this loop is not associated with the base and the ribose hydroxyl of the natural UMP. Moreover, in the structure of E-RTC:UMP-nsp9:GMPPNP, loop 50-KNT-52 also exhibits an upward conformation, indicating that the conformational change is not induced by simultaneous binding with UMP and GMPPNP ( Figures S4 I and S4K). Taken together, these results suggest that the conformational change of the loop 50-KNT-52 observed in the structure of E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GMPPNP is induced by the interaction of nsp12 NiRAN with the fluoro modification on the ribose of SMP. Hence, we identify this sofosbuvir-specific loop as the “S-loop.” The downward movement of the S-loop induced by the binding of SMP results in notable changes in the binding of NAI-MPs and GMPPNP, as well as in the arrangement of residues in the catalytic center in the E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GMPPNP complex (discussed below).
RMP, SMP, and MMP linked with nsp9 bind in the Nuc-pocket ( Figures 4 I, S2 F, and S2G). Although the three NAI-MPs bind in the Nuc-pocket similar to the binding of A+1, the chemical modifications on each NAI-MP, as well as conformational changes in the S-loop results in variations in their mode of binding.
In E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GMPPNP, the 2′-F and the 3′-hydroxyl group of the ribose of SMP form bonds with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of nsp12 L49/K50 in the S-loop and the backbone carbon atom of nsp12 T51. In contrast, because the S-loop is in an upward conformation, the nitrogen of the nsp12 K50 side chain, instead of its backbone carbonyl oxygen, makes contacts with the ribose of RMP and MMP. Moreover, the carbonyl oxygen of nsp12 L49 contacts with the hydroxyl group in the ribose of RMP and MMP, as well as the chemical modifications in the ribose of RMP, stabilizing the inhibitors. It is also noteworthy that the side chain of nsp12 T51 contacts with the ribose of RMP but does not interact with MMP. Furthermore, the base of the bound SMP forms contacts with nsp12 N39/V42/N713, but additional contacts of the nitrogen of nsp12 K41 side chain with the base groups of the bound MMP and RMP are also observed.
The arrangements of the G-pocket and the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN are generally similar in the four NAI structures and the E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP complex ( Figures 4 A-4D). However, as a result of the downward movement of the S-loop, the width of the channel from the catalytic center to the G-pocket is narrowed from ∼8.7 to ∼7.7 Å in E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GMPPNP ( Figures S4 L and S4M). The ribose and the β-phosphate are pushed down with the largest distance being ∼1.8 Å due to the downward movement of nsp12 T51 ( Figure S4 N).
The binding mode of the base and the ribose of GMPPNP in the G-pocket in the four RTC complexes with NAI-nsp9 is generally similar to that observed in E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP ( Figures 4 J and S2 H–S2J). In all of the structures, nsp12 T120/K121/R55 form a set of hydrogen bonds with the base of GMPPNP. Residues nsp12 V31/K50/C53/Y69/V71/Y122/T123/Y217 also contribute to the stabilization of the base and the ribose of GMPPNP. As a result of S-loop movement, the side chain of nsp12 T51 contacts with the ribose and the α-phosphate upon SMP binding, whereas the side chain of nsp12 K50 stacks parallel with GMPPNP in the RMP/MMP/ATMP complexes.
The arrangements of the catalytic center in RTC in complex with ATMP/MMP/RMP- nsp9 are also similar to those in E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP, where nsp12 K73, nsp12 R116, nsp12 D208, nsp12 N209, nsp12 D218, nsp12 G220, and nsp12 D221 bind the three phosphates of GMPPNP. It is noteworthy that Mg 2+ binding with the phosphate groups cannot be clearly observed in the densities of RTC in complex with MMP-nsp9 and ATMP-nsp9, possibly due to the limitation of the cryo-EM data ( Figures 4 G and 4H). A significant exception is in the structure of RTC with SMP-nsp9 ( Figures 4 B, 4F, 4I, S4 O, and S4P). This appears to be as a result of the downward movement of the S-loop in E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GMPPNP, which allows the side chain of nsp12 T51 to form contacts with both the ribose and the α-phosphate of SMP. Meanwhile, the contact between Mg 2+ and the α-phosphate is lost, although the Mg 2+ -γ-phosphate bond still exists. In addition, the side chain of nsp12 D218 rotates ∼90° away from the phosphate groups, thus losing interactions with all three phosphate groups.
In the structures of E-RTC:RNA-nsp9 and E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP, a water molecule is observed coordinated by the side chain of nsp12 D208 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of nsp12 D36 ( Figures 5 A and 5B). In E-RTC:RNA-nsp9, this water is 4.6 Å from the α-phosphorus of A+1. However, in E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP, the distance between this water and the α-phosphorus of A+1 is reduced to 3.8 Å. This is likely to be caused by the conformational change upon GMPPNP binding. In a previously reported structure of the deAMPylation FIC (filamentation induced by cAMP) enzymes, a water molecule coordinated by a negatively charged hydrophilic residue locates near to the phospho-ester bond at a distance of ∼3.6 Å and is proposed to play an essential role in breaking the phospho-ester bond ( Veyron et al., 2019 41. Veyron, S. ∙ Oliva, G. ∙ Rolando, M. ... A Ca 2+ -regulated deAMPylation switch in human and bacterial FIC proteins Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1142 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). The similar arrangement here allow us to also propose that nsp12 D208 may attract a proton from the water molecule to activate the nucleophilic attack by its oxygen on the α-phosphorus of A+1. This could only occur when the distance between the water molecule and α-phosphorus of A+1 decreases to ∼3.8 Å. This action will lead to the breaking of the phospho-amide bond between nsp9 N1 and A+1 and provide a lone pair of electrons to bind to the oxygen of α-phosphor of A+1 for the following attack on the β-phosphorus of GTP to form GpppA. This structural observation is consistent with the kinetic data for the D208A where de-RNAlyation of nsp9 and subsequent GpppA formation are abolished ( Figures 2 F and 3 G). Hence, we term this water as the “bond-breaking” water (bb-wat).
The binding mode details for the bb-wat are variable in the structures of RTC in complex with the four different NAIs ( Figures 5 C–5E). In E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GMPPNP, although bb-wat has similar contacts with nsp12 D208 and nsp12 D36, its distance to the α-phosphorus of SMP is 5.5 Å, much longer than that observed in E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP ( Figure 5 D). A similar long distance between bb-wat with α-phosphorus of the phospho-amide bond is observed in E-RTC:RMP-nsp9:GMPPNP (4.7 Å) and in E-RTC:MMP-nsp9:GMPPNP (4.2 Å) ( Figures 5 C and 5E). However, in the structure of E-RTC:ATMP-nsp9:GMPPNP, the density does not support a convincing bb-wat in the model ( Figure 5 F). In the three structures with the observed bb-wat, the distance from bb-wat to the α-phosphorus of RMP/SMP/MMP ranges from 4.2 to 5.5 Å, even upon the binding of GMPPNP. This distance is 4.9 Å in the E-RTC:SMP-nsp9:GTP complex ( Figure S4 E). This may be an explanation as to why the covalent bond of NAI-MP with nsp9 cannot be broken with the incubation of nsp12 and GTP ( Figure S5 F).

Section: Discussion

Combining the structural data and assay results, we propose a model for an alternative mechanism for the formation of GpppA catalyzed by nsp12 NiRAN in SARS-CoV-2 ( Figures 6 , S6 A, and S6B). In the first step, the 5′ end of product RNA binds to the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, possibly with its first adenosine nucleotide (A+1) binding at the Nuc-pocket. In the second step, the lone pair of electrons from the free amino group of nsp9 N1 attack the α-phosphorus of the A+1 nucleotide, thus releasing PPi and the RNAylated nsp9. In the third step, upon binding of GTP to the G-pocket, the bb-wat coordinated by nsp12 D208 is nearby and in a position to break the phospho-amide bond between nsp9 N1 and the α-phosphor of A+1, providing a lone pair of electrons to the oxygen of the α-phosphor. In the last step, the non-bridging oxygen from the remaining α-phosphate group of A+1 attacks the β-phosphorus of GTP bound in the G-pocket, thus releasing Pi and generating the GpppA at 5′-RNA end.
When this manuscript was under revision, an independent study biochemically revealed the RNAylation of nsp9 and mediated GpppA formation ( Park et al., 2022 28. Park, G.J. ∙ Osinski, A. ∙ Hernandez, G. ... The mechanism of RNA capping by SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2022; 609 :793-800 PubMed Google Scholar ). In that work, GDP was reported to be a better substrate for deRNAylation than GTP. That work proposed that a GDP binds at the position, which is reported in the structure of E-RTC:apo-nsp9:GDP (PDB: 7CYQ) ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of an extended SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex reveals an intermediate state in cap synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ) (termed as “base-out pose” position by Malone et al. ( Malone et al., 2022 24. Malone, B.F. ∙ Perry, J.K. ∙ Olinares, P.D.B. ... Structural basis for substrate selection by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar )), represents the GDP substrate to form GpppA with the RNAylated nsp9 ( Figures S3 F–S3H). First, the high purity of the GTP samples used in this work shows that GTP is also a substrate for GpppA formation ( Figures S1 C and S1D). The structures of E-RTC:RNA-nsp9/SMP-nsp9 in complex with GTP also demonstrate that GTP can bind in the G-pocket. Superimposition of the structures of E-RTC:apo-nsp9:GDP (PDB: 7CYQ) ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of an extended SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex reveals an intermediate state in cap synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ) and E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP shows that the GDP in the “base-out pose” position extensively clashes with the nucleotides bonded to nsp9 N1 ( Figure S3 I), suggesting this model is structurally less likely. Third, previous structural studies have revealed that the “base-out pose” position not only binds GDP (PDB: 7CYQ) but also accommodates ADP (PDB: 6XEZ) ( Chen et al., 2020 6. Chen, J. ∙ Malone, B. ∙ Llewellyn, E. ... Structural basis for helicase-polymerase coupling in the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex Cell. 2020; 182 :1560-1573.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 J), which is consistent the structural observation that the bases of the bound nucleotides lack interaction with NiRAN residues ( Chen et al., 2020 6. Chen, J. ∙ Malone, B. ∙ Llewellyn, E. ... Structural basis for helicase-polymerase coupling in the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex Cell. 2020; 182 :1560-1573.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ...

This is contradictory to the specificity of GTP/GDP as the substrate for GpppA formation. Finally, the G-pocket (termed as “base-in pose” position by Malone et al. [ Malone et al., 2022 24. Malone, B.F. ∙ Perry, J.K. ∙ Olinares, P.D.B. ... Structural basis for substrate selection by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ]) has been suggested to accommodate GTP, but not GDP ( Malone et al., 2022 24. Malone, B.F. ∙ Perry, J.K. ∙ Olinares, P.D.B. ... Structural basis for substrate selection by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Moreover, R55 and Y217 in the G-pocket, two conserved residues across the α-/β- coronavirus clades, were suggested to provide base specificity for guanosine in the G-pocket ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of an extended SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex reveals an intermediate state in cap synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, our results showed that the mutation of R55 significantly decreased the formation of GpppA ( Figure 3 G). These results suggest the negative impact of the R55 mutation on GpppA formation is relevant to GTP binding.
Very interestingly, a recent work found that ATDP, a GDP analog bearing a modification in the ribose group, can also bind to the G-pocket along with Mg 2+ which ligates to its β-phosphate to occupy the position of γ-phosphate of GTP ( Shannon et al., 2022 36. Shannon, A. ∙ Fattorini, V. ∙ Sama, B. ... A dual mechanism of action of AT-527 against SARS-CoV-2 polymerase Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :621 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). That structure suggests the ligation of ions may help GDP bind to the G-pocket, whereby the α-/β-phosphates are in similar positions as the GTP when bound in the same pocket. According to this evidence, we favor the idea that both GTP and GDP can be substrates to produce GpppA with the RNAylated nsp9. With the ligation of metal ion, GDP binds to the G-pocket in a similar way GTP, and the orientation of the α-/β-phosphates of GDP make the mechanism for GpppA formation also reasonable for the GDP model. The GTP model proposed in this study not only reconciles the GDP model ( Park et al., 2022 28. Park, G.J. ∙ Osinski, A. ∙ Hernandez, G. ... The mechanism of RNA capping by SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2022; 609 :793-800 PubMed Google Scholar ) but also reconciles both models with the previously reported SARS-CoV-2 RTC structures and the guanosine base specificity for GpppA formation.
In the conventional pathway, the co-transcriptional capping of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs has been known to occur by four sequential actions facilitated by nsp13, nsp12 NiRAN, nsp14 MTase, and nsp16 ( Bouvet et al., 2010 3.

In this pathway, nsp12 NiRAN functions as a GTase to transfer a GMP to ppA to produce GpppA ( Lehmann et al., 2015 21. Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Gulyaeva, A. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J.C. ...

The relevance and the efficiency of the conventional and the nsp9-RNAylation-mediated capping pathways raised our interest.
In our studies, we have shown that the two capping pathways have comparable in vitro efficiencies to form GpppA ( Figure S5 G). The attenuation of GpppA formation was observed by the mixed two pathways. Park et al. show that the RNA with 5′ diphosphate end (pp-RNA), which is the product catalyzed by nsp13 in the conventional capping pathway, cannot be used for nsp9 RNAylation and nsp9-RNAylation-mediated capping ( Park et al., 2022 28. Park, G.J. ∙ Osinski, A. ∙ Hernandez, G. ... The mechanism of RNA capping by SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2022; 609 :793-800 PubMed Google Scholar ). The attenuation of GpppA formation in the mixed system is therefore not surprising. We favor the idea that the conventional and the nsp9-RNAylation-mediated pathways can both exist, but there is no crosstalk between them.
In previously reported RTC structures, nsp13 and NiRAN are located at the two farthest ends of RTC. Furthermore, the distance between the 5′ end of the product RNA to nsp12 NiRAN is over 120 Å in currently known RTC structures. This distance is too great to easily transfer the 5′ end of the product RNA to nsp12 NiRAN for capping. These results indicate that either (1) an additional nsp13 is recruited into RTC adjacent to NiRAN or (2) the RTC would oligomerize to allow the close contact of nsp13 with nsp12 NiRAN to unwind the product-template RNA duplex and catalyze the removal of the γ-phosphate group from the 5′ end of the product RNA to generate the 5′ diphosphate end for the conventional capping pathway. Although RTC with these properties have not been structurally characterized, the alternative nsp9-RNAylation-mediated capping pathway is consistent with the available structural data. In the nsp9-RNAylation-mediated capping pathway, nsp12 NiRAN catalyzes nsp9 RNAylation and subsequent GpppA formation, indicating NiRAN can initiate the capping actions in the absence of an additional nsp13. Such a model fits better with the currently known RTC structures. Therefore, we would like to propose that in the RTC in which no additional nsp13 is adjacent to nsp12 NiRAN, the nsp9-RNAylation-mediated RNA capping may play a major role in capping. In a more complicated RTC in which an additional nsp13 would be adjacent to nsp12 NiRAN, nsp13 is present to allow pp-RNA to initiate the conventional capping pathway.
CoV-encoded nsp9 has been known to have RNA and DNA binding ability and to co-localize with NSPs, suggesting it is a key component of RTC ( Bost et al., 2000 2.

The nsp9 replicase protein of SARS-coronavirus, structure and functional insights Structure. 2004; 12 :341-353 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent structural study showed that nsp9 tightly binds nsp12 NiRAN ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of an extended SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex reveals an intermediate state in cap synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon binding with nsp12 NiRAN, nsp9 has been suggested to have multiple roles in SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription. First, nsp9 is NMPylated by nsp12 NiRAN, thus priming the synthesis of viral RNA ( Shannon et al., 2022 36. Shannon, A. ∙ Fattorini, V. ∙ Sama, B. ...

NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :8822-8835 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, Park et al. and the present work show that nsp9 is RNAylated by nsp12 NiRAN, thus being an intermediate that contributes viral RNA capping ( Park et al., 2022 28. Park, G.J. ∙ Osinski, A. ∙ Hernandez, G. ... The mechanism of RNA capping by SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2022; 609 :793-800 PubMed Google Scholar ). The RNA binding ability of nsp9 may allow nsp9 to capture the free ppp-RNA unwound by helicase and carry the RNA together to the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN for capping. It is noteworthy that the NMPylation of nsp9 is reversible in the presence of PPi but not GTP ( Wang et al., 2021 43. Wang, B. ∙ Svetlov, D. ∙ Artsimovitch, I. NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :8822-8835 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ); on the contrary, the RNAylation of nsp9 is reversible in the presence of GTP/GDP but cannot be broken by PPi ( Park et al., 2022 28. Park, G.J. ∙ Osinski, A. ∙ Hernandez, G. ... The mechanism of RNA capping by SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2022; 609 :793-800 PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2021 43.

NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :8822-8835 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting these two functions of nsp9 would not crosstalk, and thus, their reaction mechanisms are likely different. Third, nsp9 acts as an adaptor to recruit nsp14, possibly as well as nsp16, to RTC for the last two capping actions ( Yan et al., 2021b 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ...

NAI is a major type of antiviral inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. Conventionally, the active form of NAIs is known to be incorporated into the product RNA chain by the polymerase reaction, mimicking the natural NTPs. The incorporated NAIs can then terminate or stall the synthesis of RNA or result in lethal mutagenesis in the product RNA ( Kabinger et al., 2021 19. Kabinger, F. ∙ Stiller, C. ∙ Schmitzová, J. ...

In this work, our results show that NiRAN covalently binds to four NAIs at nsp9 N1. This is consistent with a previous result that shows remdesivir can be covalently linked to nsp9 ( Wang et al., 2021 43. Wang, B. ∙ Svetlov, D. ∙ Artsimovitch, I. NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :8822-8835 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results also showed that the covalent bond of NAI-MP to nsp9 is not reversible in the presence of pppRNA, GTP, GMPPNP, GDP, and GMP ( Figures S5 F and S5H), thus inhibiting subsequent processing. In addition, ATDP with the ligation of Mg 2+ can bind to the G-pocket ( Shannon et al., 2022 36. Shannon, A. ∙ Fattorini, V. ∙ Sama, B. ... A dual mechanism of action of AT-527 against SARS-CoV-2 polymerase Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :621 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting AT-527 may have an additional impact on GpppA formation by out competing GTP from the G-pocket. Since the G-pocket has the guanosine base specificity, it is conceivable that only NAIs derived from GTP/GDP may have such an additional impact.
It is noteworthy that the decoration of NAI-MP to nsp9 can be removed by PPi ( Figure S5 H), which is similar to the removal of nsp9 NMPylation by PPi ( Wang et al., 2021 43. Wang, B. ∙ Svetlov, D. ∙ Artsimovitch, I. NMPylation and de-NMPylation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 by the NiRAN domain Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :8822-8835 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). An interesting observation is that when we reacted the mixture of STP and ATP/UTP/CTP/GTP with nsp9 and nsp12, STP had optimal bonding efficiency to nsp9 ( Figure S5 I). Meanwhile, the decoration of SMP and UMP to nsp9 cannot be competed by each other ( Figures S5 J and S5K), suggesting the NAIs may also interfere nsp9 NMPylation and it primed RNA synthesis in virus life cycle. In summary, these data provide important insights into the understanding of the mechanism of action of the NAIs against SARS-CoV-2.
The rapid emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variants challenges the available vaccines and neutralizing antibodies, urging the demand to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the life cycle of the virus and to develop broad-spectrum antiviral drugs ( Mlcochova et al., 2021 27. Mlcochova, P. ∙ Kemp, S.A. ∙ Shanker Dhar, M. ... SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 Delta variant replication, sensitivity to neutralising antibodies and vaccine breakthrough Nature. 2021; 599 :114-119 Crossref Scopus (842) PubMed Google Scholar ; Planas et al., 2021 31. Planas, D. ∙ Veyer, D. ∙ Baidaliuk, A. ... Reduced sensitivity of infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617.2 to monoclonal antibodies and sera from convalescent and vaccinated individuals Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The high conservation among emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, the lack of homologs in humans, as well as the essential role in viral RNA capping make NiRAN an ideal target to discover antiviral drugs. The binding of sofosbuvir monophosphate to the Nuc-pocket leads to a sharp downward movement of S-loop through formation of interactions between the NiRAN residues and the chemical modifications on the ribose ring of sofosbuvir. Such a movement of the S-loop narrows the entrance of the G-pocket, which blocks the turnover of GTP used for the formation of GpppA.
We also conducted a molecular dynamics (MDs) simulation to investigate the interactions of nucleotide with Nuc-pocket and S-loop. A coordinate system was defined to monitor the feasibility of the nucleophilic attack of nsp9 N1 free amino group on the α-phosphorus of NTP, in which the distance between N and P α is defined as “d” and N-P α -O α-β is defined as “θ” ( Figure S6 C). The optimal geometry for initiating the nucleophilic attack is demonstrated by positioning the N in the direction of the reverse extension of P α -O α-β (i.e., θ ≈ 180°) ( Gao and Yang, 2016 16. Gao, Y. ∙ Yang, W. Capture of a third Mg² + is essential for catalyzing DNA synthesis Science. 2016; 352 :1334-1337 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a 200-ns MDs simulation, UTP presented better geometry alignment between its α-phosphorus and the free amino group of nsp9 N1 in terms of facilitating nucleophilic attack, compared with other nucleotides ( Figure S6 D). Such a difference in positional alignment for different nucleotides is associated with the motion of the nucleobases ( Figure S6 E). The uracil base intends to shift in a relatively small region close to the S-loop, whereas the other three nucleobases were in more diverse locations, implying that the uracil base is favored in the Nuc-pocket. Furthermore, it is interesting to see that the interaction of nucleobase with S-loop orients the nucleotides in a position feasible for nucleophilic attack ( Figure S6 F).
These results allow us to propose an “induce-and-lock” mechanism that can be used to develop inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 RNA capping in nsp12 NiRAN. An ideal inhibitor ruled by this mechanism would have three parts. (1) A GTP/GDP-like part that binds in the G-pocket. This would inhibit the binding of GTP and prevent GpppA from forming. (2) A SMP-like part binds in the Nuc-pocket and induces a conformational change to S-loop to provide additional assistance to lock a GTP/GDP-like part in the G-pocket, thus conceivably increasing the binding affinity of the inhibitor to NiRAN and advancing its ability to out compete GTP/GDP. The introduction of halogen atoms or hydrogen bond donors on the ribose group of the SMP-like part could enhance interactions with the main chain carbonyl groups. (3) A linker part is needed that fuses the GTP/GDP-like and the SMP-like parts. We believe that such compounds would be candidates as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 and variants.
This study has two limitations. First, the structure of a free ppp-RNA in complex with RTCs remains unclear. We have tried to collect a cryo-EM data set for a sample incubating free ppp-RNA with E-RTC:nsp9 in the presence of Ca 2+ , but no convincing density that supports building ppp-RNA can be observed. This is likely due to the relatively low binding affinity between free ppp-RNA and RTC. Second, according to the current known structural and assay results, the catalytic residues of NiRAN for the conventional pathway and the pathway reported overlap, making it difficult to assess the exclusive impact of the pathway reported here. Further investigations on this topic are warranted.

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
Proteins were obtained through recombinant expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3).
The gene encoding nsp12 of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947) was cloned into a modified pET-22b vector, with the C terminus possessing a 10 x His-tag. Protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as described previously ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ...

The transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB media containing 100 mg/L ampicillin. After the OD 600 reached 0.6, the culture was cooled to 16°C and supplemented with 0.25 mM IPTG. After overnight induction, the cells were harvested through centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) and then lysed by high-pressure homogenization and sonication at 4°C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 50 min. The fusion protein was first purified by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography and then further purified by passage through a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 4 mM DTT) and buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1M NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 4 mM DTT). Next, it was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) with DEPC-treated buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT). Purified nsp12 was concentrated to 7 mg/mL and stored at 4°C.
SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 were co-expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as a no-tagged protein and a 6× His-SUMO fusion protein, respectively ( Yan et al., 2021b 48. Yan, L. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Li, M. ... Coupling of N7-methyltransferase and 3′-5′ exoribonuclease with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase reveals mechanisms for capping and proofreading Cell. 2021; 184 :3474-3485.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). The co-transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB media containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and 50 mg/L kanamycin. After the OD 600 reached 0.8, the culture was supplemented with 0.5 mM IPTG. After shaking at 26 °C for 8 hours, the cells were harvested through centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 ) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4°C. After purification by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography, the nsp7-nsp8 complex was eluted through on-column tag cleavage by SUMO protease (ULP). The complex was further purified by using a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) and a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare, USA) in buffer 2 (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 ). Purified nsp7-nsp8 complex was concentrated to 20 mg/mL and stored at 4°C.
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 was cloned into a pET-28a vector with a N-terminal 6 x His-tag and an ALVKQ sequence which has an enzymatic cleavage site for nsp5 to produce an unmodified N-terminal for nsp9. Nsp9 was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). After harvesting by centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 ). Next, homogenization was completed using a ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4 °C. The product was then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 40 min. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and the ALVKQ sequence was removed by nsp5. The nsp9 with its native N-terminal was further purified by passage through a Hitrap SP ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) with buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT) and buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT). The eluant was then loaded onto a Superdex 75 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) with buffer C (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MnCl 2 , 4 mM DTT). The purified nsp9 was concentrated to 23 mg/mL and stored at 4 °C.
Nsp13 was purified as described previously ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of an extended SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex reveals an intermediate state in cap synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nsp13 gene was inserted into the modified pET-28a vector with a 6× His tag and thrombin enzyme sites attached at its N-terminus, and the protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol). The cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 40 min and then lysed by high-pressure homogenization and sonication. The fusion protein was first purified by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography. Eluted nsp13 was incubated with thrombin protease to cleave the 6× His tag in digestion buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% (v/v) glycerol). Cleaved nsp13 was run through a Ni-affinity column for three times to remove undigested nsp13. The flow through was then further purified by ion exchange column HiTrap S (GE Healthcare, USA), and then the sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MnCl 2 ). Purified nsp13 was concentrated to 5 mg/mL and stored at 4 °C.
Nsp9 (50 μL, 23 mg/mL) was incubated with nsp12 (50 μL, 2 mg/mL) and pppRNA (80 μl, 3.43 mg/mL) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (10 μl, 100 U/mL) at 37 °C for one hour in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM MnCl 2 . The mixture was purified by Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA), with buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, DEPC treated) and buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, DEPC treated), resulting in the RNA-nsp9 complex.
Nsp9 (50 μl, 23 mg/ml) was incubated with nsp12 (50 μl, 2 mg/ml) and NAI-TP (10 μl, 50 mg/ml) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (10 μl, 100 U/ml) at 37 °C for one hour in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM MnCl 2 . Then the mixture was loaded onto a Superdex-75 10/300 Increase column in a buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM MnCl 2 ), resulting in the formation of the NAI-MP-nsp9 complex (RMP-nsp9, or ATMP-nsp9, or MMP-nsp9, or SMP-nsp9). The UMP-nsp9 complex was purified in same way.
NAI-MP-nsp9 and RNA-nsp9 were separated by a 10 min gradient elution at a flow rate 0.5 mL/min with an ACQUITY UPLC system, which was directly interfaced with a SYNAPT-G2-Si mass spectrometer produced by Waters. Separation was achieved using a Protein BEH C4 silica capillary column (2.1mm ID, 50 mm length; Made in Ireland) packed with C-4 resin (300 Å, 1.7 μm) purchased from Waters. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution, and mobile phase B consisted of 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid.
Aliquots of 1 μL samples were loaded into an autosampler for electrospray ionization. Samples were analyzed on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (SYNAPT G2-Si, Waters company) instrument optimized for high-mass protein analysis. The measurements were performed with a 3000–3500 V capillary. Data were collected over the m/z range of 500–2000. Having acquired the raw electrospray mass spectra, the data were deconvoluted using MaxEnt 1 (Waters) to generate a spectrum (relative intensity versus mass) where all the charge-state peaks of a single species have been collapsed into a single (zero-charge) peak.
For these assays we used the Vaccinia capping system (except for SAM) (NewEngland Biolabs) and [α- 32 P]GTP to label the 5′ terminus of the RNA (ChemGenes, USA) as a positive control. GpppA-RNA activity was tested as follows: 1 μg nsp12 or mutant nsp12 was mixed with 5 μg nsp9-RNA and [α- 32 P]GTP in a buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 6 mM KCl, 4 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl 2 . After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, a G-50 Sephadex column (Roche) was used to remove excess α-[ 32 P]GTP. GpppA-RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. 5 μg nuclease P1 (NewEngland Biolabs) and 1 mM ZnCl 2 were added to digest the RNA. Reaction products were spotted on polyethylenimine cellulose plates (Merck) to separate G ∗ pppA. The plates were visualized using a PhosphorImager (PerkinElmer, USA).
MTase assay was performed in 40 μl volume: 2 μl nsp12 (2 μg/μl), 2 μl RNA-nsp9 (5 μg/μl), 2 μl GTP (0.5 mM), 1μl [α- 32 P]GTP (PerkinElmer, USA) in a buffer of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 6 mM KCl, 4 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM MnCl 2 . After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 2 μl nsp14 (2 μg/μl) and 1 μl SAM was added to the reactions and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. For 2’-O methylation, 2 μl nsp10/16 (2 μg/μl) was added in the mixture. A G-50 Sephadex column (Roche, USA) was used to remove excess α-[ 32 P]GTP. G ∗ pppA-RNA, or 7Me G ∗ pppA-RNA, or 7Me G ∗ pppA 2-O’ -RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with 3 times volume of ethanol and 0.1 times volume of sodium acetate for 1 hour. 1 μL nuclease P1 (NewEngland Biolabs, USA) and 1 μL 10x buffer were added to digest the RNA in 10 μl reactions. The products were spotted on polyethylenimine cellulose plates (Merck, German) to separate different capping products. The plates were visualized using a PhosphorImager (PerkinElmer, USA). The marker G ∗ pppA, 7Me G ∗ pppA and 7Me G ∗ pppA 2-O’ was prepared as above by Vaccinia capping enzyme and Vaccinia 2-O’-MTase.
Nsp12 was incubated with the nsp7/nsp8 complex at 4 °C for three hours at a molar ratio of 1: 2.2 in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM MnCl 2 . Then the mixture was purified by mono Q 5/50 ion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, USA), resulting in a stable nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex (C-RTC). C-RTC and nsp13 and RNA were mixed to form E-RTC at a 1:2.2:1 molar ratio, as described previously ( Yan et al., 2020b 49. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). The E-RTC was incubated with RNA-nsp9 at a 1:1.2 molar ratio with or without 0.5 mM GMPPNP to assemble the E-RTC:RNA-nsp9:GMPPNP and E-RTC:RNA-nsp9. E-RTC:NAI-MP-nsp9:GMPPNP, E-RTC:UMP-nsp9:GMPPNP, and E-RTC:UMP-nsp9 were prepared in same way.
In total, 3 μL of protein RNA complex at 3 mg/mL (added with 0.025% DDM) was applied onto a H2/O2 glow-discharged, 200-mesh Quantifoil R0.6/1.0 grid (Quantifoil, Micro Tools GmbH, Germany). The grid was then blotted for 3.0 s with a blot force of 0 at 8°C and 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cryo-EM data were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan, USA). Images were recorded at 29000× magnification and calibrated at a super-resolution pixel size of 0.82 Å/pixel. The exposure time was set to 2 s with a total accumulated dose of 60 electrons per Å 2 . All images were automatically recorded using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 26. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3088) PubMed Google Scholar ) and were collected with a defocus range from -2.0 μm to -1.0 μm. Statistics for data collection and refinement are provided in Tables 1A–1C. The methods for processing are described in Data S1 .
All dose-fractioned images were motion-corrected and dose-weighted by MotionCorr2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 51. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ) software and their contrast transfer functions were estimated by ctffind4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 33. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2721) PubMed Google Scholar ). Eight RTC samples particles were auto-picked using the model from SARS-CoV-2 Cap(-1)’-RTC (PDB: 7CYQ) ( Yan et al., 2021a 47. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of an extended SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex reveals an intermediate state in cap synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ) and extracted with a box size of 448 pixels in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 32. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3665) PubMed Google Scholar ). The subsequent 2D, 3D classifications and refinements were all performed in cryoSPARC. The particles were selected after two rounds of 2D classification based on complex integrity. This particle set was used to perform Ab-Initio reconstruction in four classes, which were then used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous refinement. Next, the particles were imported into RELION 3.03 (Scheres, 2012) to perform local classification to obtain one class particle. The methods are graphically described in Data S1 .
To build the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RTC complex, the coordinates of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 and nsp7-8 complex (PDB: 7BTF), SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 (PDB: 6ZSL), nsp9 (PDB: 6W9Q) were individually placed and fitted by rigid-body refinement into the cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 30. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF chimera—a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32507) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was manually built with RNA-nsp9 or NAI-MP-nsp9 or UMP-nsp9 using coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 15. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19618) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the guidance of the cryo-EM map, and in combination with real space refinement using Phenix ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Klaholz, B.P. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... New tools for the analysis and validation of cryo-EM maps and atomic models Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :814-840 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data validation statistics are shown in Tables S1 and S2.
To prepare the starting model for the simulation, nsp9 and nsp12 were extracted. UTP, ATP, GTP, and CTP were respectively put in Nuc-pocket, with the base, the ribose, and the α-phosphate in the position of the nucleotide counterparts and the γ-phosphate extending towards R116 and K73. The amber99sb-star-ildn force field ( Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010 22. Lindorff-Larsen, K. ∙ Piana, S. ∙ Palmo, K. ... Improved side-chain torsion potentials for the Amber ff99SB protein force field Proteins. 2010; 78 :1950-1958 Crossref Scopus (4261) PubMed Google Scholar ) and TIP3P model ( Mark and Nilsson, 2001 25. Mark, P. ∙ Nilsson, L. Structure and dynamics of the TIP3P, SPC, and SPC/E water models at 298 K J. Phys. Chem. A. 2001; 105 :9954-9960 Crossref Scopus (2436) Google Scholar ) was used for the protein and water, respectively. The GAFF2 force field ( Wang et al., 2006 44. Wang, J. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Kollman, P.A. ... Automatic atom type and bond type perception in molecular mechanical calculations J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2006; 25 :247-260 Crossref Scopus (3995) PubMed Google Scholar ) parameters were generated by ACPYE ( Sousa da Silva and Vranken, 2012 38. Sousa da Silva, A.W. ∙ Vranken, W.F. ACPYPE - AnteChamber PYthon parser interfacE BMC Res. Notes. 2012; 5 :367 Crossref Scopus (1811) PubMed Google Scholar ) and used for ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP. 150 mM sodium chloride was added to make the whole system neutral with respect to charge. The energy minimization was performed using steepest descent method, followed by 400 ps NVT, 200 ps NPT simulation and production runs of 300 ns. The overall temperature of the system was kept constant, coupling independently for protein/ligand and solvents/ions at 300 K with a V-rescale thermostat ( Bussi et al., 2007 5. Bussi, G. ∙ Donadio, D. ∙ Parrinello, M. Canonical sampling through velocity rescaling J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126 :014101 Crossref Scopus (11180) PubMed Google Scholar ). The pressure was coupled to a Parrinello-Rahman barostat ( Parrinello and Rahman, 1981 29. Parrinello, M. ∙ Rahman, A. Polymorphic transitions in single crystals: a new molecular dynamics method J. Appl. Phys. 1981; 52 :7182-7190 Crossref Scopus (13676) Google Scholar ) at 1 atm separately in every dimension. The temperature and pressure time constants of the coupling were 0.1 and 2 ps respectively. The integration of the equations of motion was performed by using a leapfrog algorithm with a time step of 2 fs. Periodic boundary conditions were implemented in all systems. A cutoff of 1.0 nm was implemented for the Lennard–Jones and the direct space part of the Ewald sum for Coulombic interactions. The Fourier space part of the Ewald splitting was computed by using the particle-mesh-Ewald method ( Darden et al., 1993 11. Darden, T. ∙ York, D. ∙ Pedersen, L. Particle mesh Ewald: an N⋅log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98 :10089-10092 Crossref Scopus (23405) Google Scholar ), with a grid length of 0.12 nm on the side and a cubic spline interpolation. The structures of the 100-300 ns trajectory were clustered using GROMOS algorithm as previously described ( Daura et al., 1999 12. Daura, X. ∙ Gademann, K. ∙ Jaun, B. ... Peptide folding: when simulation meets experiment Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38 :236-240 Crossref Google Scholar ).
In Data S1 , the resolution estimations of cryo-EM density maps are based on the 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion ( Chen et al., 2013 7. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 34.
