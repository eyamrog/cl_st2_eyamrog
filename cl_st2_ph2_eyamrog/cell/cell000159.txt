Title: Molecular Pathways of Colon Inflammation Induced by Cancer Immunotherapy


Abstract: Summary

Checkpoint blockade with antibodies specific for the PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitory receptors can induce durable responses in a wide range of human cancers. However, the immunological mechanisms responsible for severe inflammatory side effects remain poorly understood. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell analysis of immune cell populations in colitis, a common and severe side effect of checkpoint blockade. We observed a striking accumulation of CD8 T cells with highly cytotoxic and proliferative states and no evidence of regulatory T cell depletion. T cell receptor (TCR) sequence analysis demonstrated that a substantial fraction of colitis-associated CD8 T cells originated from tissue-resident populations, explaining the frequently early onset of colitis symptoms following treatment initiation. Our analysis also identified cytokines, chemokines, and surface receptors that could serve as therapeutic targets for colitis and potentially other inflammatory side effects of checkpoint blockade.

Section: Introduction

Monoclonal antibodies targeting the CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 pathways can induce durable responses in a wide range of human malignancies but can also induce inflammatory toxicities, collectively referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These irAEs can affect any organ system and remain a major limitation of checkpoint inhibition ( Larkin et al., 2015 33. Larkin, J. ∙ Chiarion-Sileni, V. ∙ Gonzalez, R. ...

Postow, M.A. ∙ Chesney, J. ∙ Pavlick, A.C. ... Nivolumab and ipilimumab versus ipilimumab in untreated melanoma N. Engl. J.

Nearly 60% of patients treated with a combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies develop severe treatment-limiting toxicities ( Dougan, 2017 11. Dougan, M. Checkpoint Blockade Toxicity and Immune Homeostasis in the Gastrointestinal Tract Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1547 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dougan and Pietropaolo, 2020 12. Dougan, M. ∙ Pietropaolo, M. Time to dissect the autoimmune etiology of cancer antibody immunotherapy J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :51-61 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cellular and molecular mechanisms of these immune-related toxicities are not well understood, precluding their optimal clinical management. The most common toxicities occur at barrier sites, including the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, liver, skin, and lungs ( Dougan and Pietropaolo, 2020 12. Dougan, M. ∙ Pietropaolo, M. Time to dissect the autoimmune etiology of cancer antibody immunotherapy J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :51-61 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis (+CPI colitis) is among the most frequent severe irAEs and is an important cause of treatment discontinuation, particularly in patients receiving a CTLA-4-blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb; ipilimumab) alone or in combination with a PD-1-blocking mAb (nivolumab).
CTLA-4 appears to play a more central role than PD-1 or PD-L1 in gut homeostasis ( Joosse et al., 2019 26. Joosse, M.E. ∙ Nederlof, I. ∙ Walker, L.S.K. ...

Mild colitis is common in patients receiving ipilimumab, with diarrhea affecting nearly half of the patients on high-dose or combination therapy ( Hodi et al., 2010 21. Hodi, F.S. ∙ O’Day, S.J. ∙ McDermott, D.F. ... Improved survival with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363 :711-723 Crossref Scopus (12399) PubMed Google Scholar ). Severe colon inflammation is less frequent but still occurs in 10%–20% of patients and can be life-threatening ( Dougan, 2017 11. Dougan, M. Checkpoint Blockade Toxicity and Immune Homeostasis in the Gastrointestinal Tract Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1547 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Postow et al., 2018 47.

Med. 2018; 378 :158-168 Crossref Scopus (2990) PubMed Google Scholar ). +CPI colitis is frequently characterized by continuous inflammation from the anus to the cecum, and histopathological analysis identified a high proportion of lymphocytes and increased numbers of apoptotic epithelial cells ( Coutzac et al., 2017 9. Coutzac, C. ∙ Adam, J. ∙ Soularue, E. ... Colon Immune-Related Adverse Events: Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 Blockade Induce Distinct Immunopathological Entities J.

Although mucosal inflammation induced by CPIs most frequently involves the colon, approximately a quarter of patients with colitis also have inflammation in the small intestine (enteritis) ( Downey et al., 2007 13.

Immune-related adverse events in the gastrointestinal tract: diagnostic utility of upper gastrointestinal biopsies Histopathology. 2020; 76 :233-243 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). As with most other severe irAEs, current management of CPI colitis includes high-dose, systemic corticosteroids and CPI discontinuation ( Postow et al., 2018 47. Postow, M.A. ∙ Sidlow, R. ∙ Hellmann, M.D. Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated with Immune Checkpoint Blockade N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :158-168 Crossref Scopus (2990) PubMed Google Scholar ). Preliminary clinical data indicate that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) blockade can be efficacious for treatment of +CPI colitis resistant to corticosteroids ( Badran et al., 2019 5. Badran, Y.R. ∙ Cohen, J.V. ∙ Brastianos, P.K. ... Concurrent therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and TNFα blockade in patients with gastrointestinal immune-related adverse events J. Immunother. Cancer. 2019; 7 :226 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). The influence of systemic corticosteroids on anti-tumor responses is presently unknown; corticosteroids induce apoptosis of proliferating T cells, and retrospective data suggest that high-dose corticosteroids may diminish optimal therapeutic responses ( Arbour et al., 2018 4. Arbour, K.C. ∙ Mezquita, L. ∙ Long, N. ... Impact of Baseline Steroids on Efficacy of Programmed Cell Death-1 and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Blockade in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer J.

High-dose glucocorticoids for the treatment of ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis is associated with reduced survival in patients with melanoma Cancer. 2018; 124 :3706-3714 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ). Development of alternative treatment approaches targeting inflammatory pathways specific to +CPI colitis without impairing anti-tumor immunity is therefore of crucial importance.
The immunological mechanisms of irAEs have been difficult to study because colitis and other irAEs are not observed in murine tumor models treated with checkpoint inhibitors ( Curran et al., 2010 10. Curran, M.A. ∙ Montalvo, W. ∙ Yagita, H. ... PD-1 and CTLA-4 combination blockade expands infiltrating T cells and reduces regulatory T and myeloid cells within B16 melanoma tumors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :4275-4280 Crossref Scopus (1498) PubMed Google Scholar ). This project was designed to directly study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of colitis as an example of a common and frequently severe irAE. We studied recently diagnosed colitis patients who had not yet received drug treatment for this irAE and used diagnostic tissue biopsies for comprehensive analysis of immune cell populations by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multi-spectral flow cytometry. This approach led to discovery of cellular and molecular pathways in +CPI colitis as well as identification of potential therapeutic targets for this important side effect of cancer immunotherapy.

Section: Results

We present the first in-depth cellular and molecular analysis of immune cell populations in an irAE induced by checkpoint inhibition therapy with a specific focus on CPI colitis. Immune cell populations were comprehensively studied using two complementary approaches: 5′ barcoded scRNA-seq as a discovery tool and multi-spectral flow cytometry for quantification of cell populations and markers at the protein level ( Figure 1 A). We performed these studies in three patient populations: (1) CPI-treated melanoma patients with histologically confirmed colitis (n = 8, +CPI colitis), (2) healthy adults of similar age undergoing screening colonoscopies (n = 8, control), and (3) CPI-treated melanoma patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation for suspected +CPI colitis but were found to have a normal colonic mucosa endoscopically and histologically (n = 6, +CPI no colitis) ( Figure 1 B). This group of drug-exposed patients without colitis was evenly split between patients who had or did not have enteritis ( Hughes et al., 2019 23. Hughes, M.S. ∙ Molina, G.E. ∙ Chen, S.T. ... Budesonide treatment for microscopic colitis from immune checkpoint inhibitors J. Immunother. Cancer. 2019; 7 :292 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study design allowed us to distinguish molecular changes induced by drug exposure from the actual disease process. All CPI-treated patients had been recently treated with CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies, except for one patient in each group who received anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy ( Figure 1 B; Tables S1 and S2 ). Biopsies were obtained soon after development of colitis symptoms (average of 4.5 days, maximum of 13 days) from three major regions of the lower GI tract, predominantly spanning the descending colon through the rectum ( Figure 1 A). Only a single patient in the cohort received corticosteroids prior to biopsy ( Table S3 ). Tissue specimens were enzymatically digested to liberate cells from the lamina propria (LP) and epithelial layer, which also contains intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). We sequentially isolated live CD45 + mononuclear cells as well as CD3 + T cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for scRNA-seq using 10X Genomics 5′ barcoding technology ( Figures 1 A and S1 A).
We prepared scRNA-seq libraries from CD45 + immune cells for 16 patients (n = 6 +CPI colitis, n = 5 +CPI no colitis, n = 5 control), which provided high-quality transcriptomes for a total of 51,652 cells ( Figures 1 B and S1 B). Data integration revealed 16 distinct clusters comprising all expected immune cell populations, including T cells, B cells, immunoglobulin A (IgA) + plasma B cells, myeloid cells, mast cells, and innate lympoid cells (ILCs); neutrophils were excluded by FACS because of their incompatibility with the 10X Genomics platform ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 C). Each cluster contained cells from all patients, indicating the absence of major patient-specific batch effects ( Figures 1 E and 1F). The most striking changes between +CPI colitis and control groups were observed in the T cell compartment, which was represented by six clusters in this CD45 + dataset. In particular, we observed substantial shifts in the structure of T cell populations; in colitis compared with control cases, we identified a striking increase in the fraction of T cells in clusters 15 (CD8 + cytotoxic lymphocytes, CTL) and 16 (cycling T cells) ( Figures 1 E–1G and S1 D). T cell populations in both control groups (+CPI no colitis and control) were significantly different from those in colitis patients, indicating that these changes in T cell populations were related to the disease state rather than drug exposure ( Figures 1 E and S1 D). Similar changes in T cell clusters were observed in colitis patients exposed to different CPI drugs, including monotherapy with ipilimumab (patient C2), combination therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab (patient C3), and sequential pembrolizumab and ipilimumab (patient C1) ( Figure S1 D). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the +CPI colitis-associated increase in relative CD3 + T cell frequency and absolute number ( Figures 1 H, S1 E, and S1F). T cell frequency, quantified by flow cytometry and scRNA-seq, was strongly correlated, serving as cross-validation of these experimental methods ( Figure 1 I). In addition to these changes in the T cell compartment, we also observed an increase in the frequency of myeloid cells in colitis patients compared with healthy control subjects ( Figures 1 E and 1G). These results demonstrate that +CPI colitis is associated with major changes in colonic immune cells, including cytotoxic and cycling T cells as well as myeloid-lineage cells.
We additionally generated scRNA-seq libraries for CD3 + T cells from 22 subjects ( Figure 1 B), which provided transcriptomes for 67,926 cells and corresponding T cell receptor (TCR) sequences ( Figures S2 A–S2G). We analyzed major T cell lineages by flow cytometry and found that the frequency of CD8 + T cells (defined as CD4 − because of partial CD8 cleavage by tissue digestion enzymes) among total CD3 + cells was similar among the three patient groups, indicating that CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were expanded in colitis patients ( Figures S2 H–S2J). Non-classical T cell lineages present in the colon, including γδ T cells and mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, did not significantly differ among the three patient groups ( Figures S2 K and S2L).
Sub-clustering of CD8 + T cells revealed eight well-defined sub-populations that were annotated based on published signatures and cell markers ( Figures 2 A, 2B, S3 A, and S3B; Martin et al., 2019 37. Martin, J.C. ∙ Chang, C. ∙ Boschetti, G. ...

Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ). The overall organization of the CD8 + T cell compartment showed striking differences between +CPI colitis patients and both control groups: clusters 7 (cytotoxic effectors) and 8 (cycling T cells, MKI67 + ) were nearly exclusive to +CPI colitis patients ( Figures 2 C–2E). T cells from colitis patients were also enriched in two smaller clusters (cluster 6, central memory/naive cells; cluster 5, terminal effector cells). In contrast, the fraction of T cells from clusters representing tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells was reduced in +CPI colitis patients ( Figure 2 E; Kumar et al., 2017 30. Kumar, B.V. ∙ Ma, W. ∙ Miron, M. ... Human Tissue-Resident Memory T Cells Are Defined by Core Transcriptional and Functional Signatures in Lymphoid and Mucosal Sites Cell Rep. 2017; 20 :2921-2934 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (674) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD8 + T cells from clusters 7 and 8 showed high expression of cytotoxicity genes, including GZMB ( Figure 2 F) and characteristic interferon γ (IFNγ) response genes ( HLA-DRA and CD74 ) ( Figures 2 B, S3 C, and S3D).
We confirmed the increased frequency of cytotoxic effector CD8 + T cells in +CPI colitis patients by flow cytometry for the same patient cohort ( Figures 2 G–2I). Importantly, a colitis patient who received ipilimumab monotherapy also had a large fraction of granzyme B + CD8 + T cells (59.5%), suggesting that the increase in cytotoxic CD8 + T cells was not restricted to combination CPI ( Figure S3 E). The percentage of granzyme B + CD8 + T cells was also increased in +CPI-treated patients without colitis compared with healthy control subjects, demonstrating that CPI itself caused elevation of the cytotoxicity program ( Figure 2 G). Mirroring the scRNA-seq data, cycling (Ki-67 + ) granzyme B + CD8 + T cells were increased dramatically in +CPI colitis patients ( Figures 2 H and 2I), whereas Trm populations were reduced ( Figures 2 J and 2K).
To determine the localization of cycling cytotoxic T cells, we performed multi-color immunofluorescence analysis of tissue sections in +CPI colitis compared with healthy subjects. Large clusters of cycling (Ki-67 + ) CD8 + and CD4 + cells were predominantly localized in the LP in +CPI colitis patients treated with CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies ( Figure 2 L); fewer CD8 + and CD4 + cells were observed in the LP of healthy subjects. These data demonstrate striking colitis-associated changes in colonic CD8 + T cells, characterized by a shift from Trm to cytotoxic, cycling effector T cells.
Sub-clustering of CD4 + T cells revealed 10 populations that showed major differences between +CPI colitis and control cases; notably, clusters 9 and 10 were nearly exclusively comprised of cells from +CPI colitis patients ( Figures 3 A–3D, S4 A, and S4B). Cells in cluster 9 were Th1 effector cells that highly expressed a number of IFNγ-inducible genes, including GBP1/5 , STAT1 , and CD74 ( Figures 3 B and S4 A–S4D). Cluster 10 was comprised of MKI67 + cycling conventional and regulatory T (Treg) cells, which we corroborated at the protein level ( Figures 3 B, 3J, 3K, and S4 A). A population of cytotoxic CD4 + T cells (cluster 8) was identified based on expression of GZMA and GZMH . Although this cluster was not enriched in +CPI colitis cases, GZMA was a top differentially expressed gene in CD4 + T cells from colitis-associated clusters (9 and 10) compared with non-colitis clusters (1–8) ( Figure S4 C). Similar to CD8 + Trm T cell populations, Trm clusters 1 and 3 were reduced as a fraction of CD4 + T cells in colitis patients ( Figure 3 D).
CTLA-4 is highly expressed by FoxP3 + Treg cells, and studies using mouse models have indicated that CTLA-4 antibody therapy can induce depletion of Treg cells in tumors ( Simpson et al., 2013 52. Simpson, T.R. ∙ Li, F. ∙ Montalvo-Ortiz, W. ... Fc-dependent depletion of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells co-defines the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 therapy against melanoma J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210 :1695-1710 Crossref Scopus (1116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Depletion of CTLA-4 + Treg cells has therefore been hypothesized to cause the high frequency of irAEs in ipilimumab-treated patients, although evidence in human cases does not support this model ( Coutzac et al., 2017 9. Coutzac, C. ∙ Adam, J. ∙ Soularue, E. ... Colon Immune-Related Adverse Events: Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 Blockade Induce Distinct Immunopathological Entities J.

Sharma, A. ∙ Subudhi, S.K. ∙ Blando, J. ... Anti-CTLA-4 Immunotherapy Does Not Deplete FOXP3 + Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) in Human Cancers Clin. Cancer Res. 2019; 25 :1233-1238 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage of FoxP3 + cells within the total CD4 + T cell population was significantly elevated in +CPI colitis patients compared with both control groups, consistent with increased Treg cell proliferation ( Figures 3 E, 3K, and S4 F). FoxP3 protein levels were higher in Treg cells from +CPI colitis patients compared with healthy control subjects ( Figures 3 F and 3G). High FoxP3 levels are characteristic of bona fide Treg cells, whereas activated effector T cells transiently express FoxP3 at a lower level ( Miyara et al., 2009 42. Miyara, M. ∙ Yoshioka, Y. ∙ Kitoh, A. ... Functional delineation and differentiation dynamics of human CD4+ T cells expressing the FoxP3 transcription factor Immunity. 2009; 30 :899-911 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1843) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2007 59. Wang, J. ∙ Ioan-Facsinay, A. ∙ van der Voort, E.I. ... Transient expression of FOXP3 in human activated nonregulatory CD4+ T cells Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37 :129-138 Crossref Scopus (875) PubMed Google Scholar ). CTLA4 mRNA and CTLA-4 protein levels were also maintained in CD4 + T cells from +CPI colitis patients compared with both control groups ( Figures 3 H, 3I, and S4 A).
Further analysis of cluster 7 identified five sub-clusters; cells in four of these sub-clusters expressed high levels of FOXP3 , as expected for Treg cells (clusters 1–4) ( Figures 3 L–3N and S4 G). Cluster 1 Treg cells expressed several genes characteristic of Th1 cells, such as IL12RB2 (interleukin-12 [IL-12] receptor), CXCR3 , and STAT1 , and this population was enriched in +CPI colitis patients ( Figures 3 O, S4 H, and S4I). In response to IFNγ, Treg cells upregulate Th1 programs, which enhance their regulatory function for suppression of IFNγ-producing Th1 effector cells ( Koch et al., 2009 27. Koch, M.A. ∙ Tucker-Heard, G. ∙ Perdue, N.R. ... The transcription factor T-bet controls regulatory T cell homeostasis and function during type 1 inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10 :595-602 Crossref Scopus (1003) PubMed Google Scholar ). The transcriptional program of cluster 1 Treg cells may therefore be related to IFNγ production by effector T cells. These data demonstrate that colitis induced by combination CPI or anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy is not caused by depletion of CTLA-4 + Treg cells ( Figures 3 E–3I and S4 E) and that the inflammatory environment alters the gene expression programs of Treg cells.
We next aimed to investigate the origin of T cells in colitis-associated clusters, in particular with respect to a potential relationship to Trm cells. This question is particularly relevant for irAEs affecting epithelial tissues (including skin, lung, and gut) because these environmental interfaces are infiltrated by substantial populations of Trm cells ( Masopust and Soerens, 2019 38. Masopust, D. ∙ Soerens, A.G. Tissue-Resident T Cells and Other Resident Leukocytes Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 37 :521-546 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ; Szabo et al., 2019 57. Szabo, P.A. ∙ Miron, M. ∙ Farber, D.L. Location, location, location: Tissue resident memory T cells in mice and humans Sci. Immunol. 2019; 4 :4 Crossref Scopus (355) Google Scholar ). T cells undergo clonal expansion following TCR activation, enabling use of TCR sequences (clonotypes) as molecular barcodes for mapping of differentiation trajectories. Most cells from the CD4 and CD8 datasets expressed an αβ TCR (average of 91.0% of CD8 and 98.9% of CD4 T cells), with the exception of the CD8 cluster 1 (IELs), which contained a substantial population of γδ T cells ( Figures S5 A and S5F–S5H). The high fraction of expanded CD8 + T cells permitted a robust comparison of TCR clonotype sharing between clusters ( Figure S5 B).
We investigated whether TCRs from clonally expanded CD8 + T cells could be identified in multiple clusters. For each patient, we determined the number of expanded TCR clonotypes that were shared by two or more clusters and then aggregated these data for each patient group to evaluate disease-associated TCR clonotype sharing ( Figures 4 A and S5 C). In +CPI colitis patients, 94.2% of expanded TCRs in cluster 8 (cycling cells) were shared with cluster 7 (cytotoxic effector cells), revealing a dynamic connection between these two colitis-associated CD8 + T cell states. In colitis patients, a large percentage of clonally expanded TCRs from Trm T cell clusters (1–3) were shared with colitis-associated clusters 7 and 8 (56.62% of expanded TCRs from clusters 1–3 shared with clusters 7 and 8) ( Figures 4 A–4C).
We also systematically examined sharing of expanded TCR clonotypes across all combinations of clusters ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Inter-cluster sharing of expanded TCRs was dramatically altered among patient cohorts. In control groups, expanded TCR clonotypes were primarily shared between Trm clusters 1 and 2. In contrast, +CPI colitis patient TCR clonotypes significantly overlapped between clusters 7 and 8 as well as clusters 7 and 2. Single-cell transcriptome data were also used to infer dynamic changes between cell populations by computation of splicing-based RNA velocity ( La Manno et al., 2018 31. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1954) PubMed Google Scholar ). This analysis revealed a potential differentiation trajectory from Trm to cytotoxic effector cells ( Figure 4 E). CD4 T cells exhibited less overall clonal expansion ( Figures S5 B, S5D, and S5E), consistent with lower proliferation in response to common viral pathogens compared with CD8 T cells ( Foulds et al., 2002 15. Foulds, K.E. ∙ Zenewicz, L.A. ∙ Shedlock, D.J. ... Cutting edge: CD4 and CD8 T cells are intrinsically different in their proliferative responses J. Immunol. 2002; 168 :1528-1532 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data demonstrate a dynamic connection between colitis-associated CD8 T cell clusters and Trm CD8 T cell clusters in +CPI colitis patients.
We next evaluated the expression of inhibitory receptors by colitis-associated CD8 + and CD4 + T cell populations. CTLA4 gene expression was significantly upregulated in colitis-associated CD8 + and CD4 + T cell clusters ( Figure 5 A–5C, 5E–5G, S6 D, and S6E). At the protein level, an increased percentage of CD8 + T cells expressed granzyme B and CTLA-4 in +CPI colitis patients compared with control subjects ( Figures S6 A–S6C). We also observed elevated expression of PDCD1 (encoding PD-1) in colitis-associated CD8 + and CD4 + clusters ( Figures 5 B, 5C, 5F, and 5G). Antibodies specific for TIM-3 and LAG-3 are currently being evaluated as alternative cancer immunotherapies, and expression of the corresponding genes HAVCR2 and LAG3 was elevated in colitis-associated CD8 + T cells (cluster 7) and, to a lesser extent, in CD4 + T cells (cluster 10) ( Huang et al., 2019 22. Huang, B. ∙ Chen, Z. ∙ Geng, L. ...

Solomon, B.L. ∙ Garrido-Laguna, I. TIGIT: a novel immunotherapy target moving from bench to bedside Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2018; 67 :1659-1667 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To define common molecular pathways and potential targets for intervention, we evaluated the most differentially expressed genes in colitis-associated clusters. The cytotoxicity genes GZMB and GNLY (CD8 + T cells) and GZMA (CD4 + T cells) were the top differentially expressed genes in colitis-associated clusters ( Figures 5 D, 5H, S3 C, and S4 C). A number of colitis-associated upregulated genes were characteristic of an IFNγ response, consistent with elevation of IFNG mRNA in colitis-associated CD8 + and CD4 + T cell clusters ( Figures 2 B, S3 D, 3 B, and S4 D). These include guanylate exchange factors ( GBP5 ) as well as genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation pathway ( HLA-DR and CD74 ), which is increased in T cells during activation and in response to IFNγ signaling. We analyzed hallmark gene sets collected from the Molecular Signatures Database ( Liberzon et al., 2015 34. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that IFNγ response genes (and overlapping IFNα response genes) were highly enriched in colitis-associated CD4 + and CD8 + T cell clusters ( Figure S6 F). IFNγ can directly induce apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells and enhance antigen presentation to T cells by MHC class I and class II pathways ( Langer et al., 2019 32. Langer, V. ∙ Vivi, E. ∙ Regensburger, D. ... IFN-γ drives inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis through VE-cadherin-directed vascular barrier disruption J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :4691-4707 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Neurath, 2014 43. Neurath, M.F. Cytokines in inflammatory bowel disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :329-342 Crossref Scopus (1938) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify colonic immune cell populations responding to T cell effector programs, we analyzed inflammatory gene expression signatures across all populations in the CD45 + dataset ( Figure 1 C). We found that IFNγ- and TNFα-induced signatures were significantly upregulated in myeloid cells (cluster 5) compared with all other immune cell populations ( Figure 6 A). The top differentially expressed genes in myeloid cells from +CPI colitis compared with control patients were IFNγ response genes, including CXCL9 and CXCL10 , which encode chemokines that recruit CXCR3 + effector T cells to sites of inflammation ( Figure 6 B). Pathway enrichment analysis also showed that gene sets associated with IFNγ response and TNFα signaling were upregulated by myeloid cells in +CPI colitis versus control patients ( Figure 6 C). Sub-clustering of myeloid cells revealed three macrophage/monocyte clusters (1–3), one dendritic cell cluster (4), and one cluster representing macrophages that may have phagocytosed T cells (5; co-expression of macrophage and T cell genes but low doublet score) ( Figures 6 D–6H). Most macrophages in cluster 1 originated from +CPI colitis patients ( Figure 6 F) and exhibited elevated expression of IFNγ-inducible genes, including CXCL9 and CXCL10 ( Figures 6 G and 6I). Macrophages in cluster 1 also had an elevated TNFα signaling gene expression signature ( Figure 6 I). These data demonstrated that IFNγ changes the gene expression program of myeloid cells and induces expression of chemokines that can recruit effector T cells to sites of inflammation.
We considered two molecular mechanisms as opportunities for therapeutic intervention in +CPI colitis: recruitment of T cells and production of soluble inflammatory mediators. The chemokine receptor genes CXCR3 and CXCR6 were upregulated in T cells from +CPI colitis patients compared with control subjects ( Figures 7 A–7D and S7 A). CXCR6 was one of the top differentially expressed genes in colitis-associated CD4 + T cell populations ( Figure 5 H), and the ligand encoded by CXCL16 was expressed by myeloid cells and mast cells. Interestingly, CXCR6 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers (including prostate, breast, gastric, lung, and ovarian cancer) and plays an important role in metastasis ( Xiao et al., 2015 62. Xiao, G. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Wang, J. ... CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine signaling mediates breast cancer progression by pERK1/2-dependent mechanisms Oncotarget. 2015; 6 :14165-14178 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). CXCR6 inhibition may therefore reduce cancer cell metastasis and also ameliorate inflammation in the colon, although the role of this chemokine receptor in tumor immunity remains to be studied further. Overexpression of the CXCR3 gene by T cells ( Figure 7 D) and CXCL9 and CXCL10 by myeloid cells ( Figures 7 C and 6 B) in +CPI colitis patients suggests that such T cell-myeloid crosstalk is also important for T cell recruitment.
The integrin β7 subunit ( ITGB7 gene) pairs with the αE ( ITGAE ) or α4 ( ITGA4 ) subunits to form the αEβ7 and α4β7 receptors. The αEβ7 integrin is a hallmark of Trm T cells and enables adherence to E-cadherin-expressing epithelial cells ( Cepek et al., 1994 8. Cepek, K.L. ∙ Shaw, S.K. ∙ Parker, C.M. ... Adhesion between epithelial cells and T lymphocytes mediated by E-cadherin and the alpha E beta 7 integrin Nature. 1994; 372 :190-193 Crossref Scopus (1021) PubMed Google Scholar ; Szabo et al., 2019 57. Szabo, P.A. ∙ Miron, M. ∙ Farber, D.L. Location, location, location: Tissue resident memory T cells in mice and humans Sci. Immunol. 2019; 4 :4 Crossref Scopus (355) Google Scholar ). The ITGAE chain was highly expressed by CD8 + T cells in colitis-associated clusters (7, 8, and 5) and Trm clusters ( Figures 7 E and S7 B). ITGAE expression was lower in CD4 + T cell clusters, although a substantial fraction of cycling CD4 + cells (cluster 10) also expressed this gene. The α4β7 integrin enables recruitment of T cells from the blood into the gut, and the ITGA4 gene was elevated in CD4 + colitis-associated clusters (9 and 10) and Treg cells (cluster 7) as well as in a fraction of CD8 + cytotoxic effector cells (cluster 7) ( Figures 7 E and S7 B). Preliminary clinical data indicate that vedolizumab, a α4β7 integrin-specific mAb, has efficacy in +CPI colitis patients who failed to respond to corticosteroids ( Abu-Sbeih et al., 2018 1. Abu-Sbeih, H. ∙ Ali, F.S. ∙ Alsaadi, D. ... Outcomes of vedolizumab therapy in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis: a multi-center study J. Immunother. Cancer. 2018; 6 :142 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). A mAb specific for the β7 chain, which inhibits the function of αEβ7 and α4β7 integrin, could also be a therapeutic opportunity for +CPI colitis.
Finally, we investigated the expression of cytokines and their receptors in T cell and myeloid cell populations. A number of cytokine-receptor pairs were upregulated in +CPI colitis patients ( Figures 7 F, 7G, and S7 C). Myeloid cells from +CPI colitis compared with healthy control subjects overexpressed several cytokine genes related to intestinal homeostasis, including TNF , IL1B , and OSM ( Maloy and Powrie, 2011 36. Maloy, K.J. ∙ Powrie, F. Intestinal homeostasis and its breakdown in inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2011; 474 :298-306 Crossref Scopus (1484) PubMed Google Scholar ; West et al., 2017 60. West, N.R. ∙ Hegazy, A.N. ∙ Owens, B.M.J. ..., Oxford IBD Cohort Investigators Oncostatin M drives intestinal inflammation and predicts response to tumor necrosis factor-neutralizing therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :579-589 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ); some of these transcripts were also elevated in myeloid cells from +CPI no-colitis patients compared with healthy control subjects. Preliminary clinical data indicate that TNFα blockade can be efficacious for treatment of +CPI colitis resistant to corticosteroids ( Badran et al., 2019 5. Badran, Y.R. ∙ Cohen, J.V. ∙ Brastianos, P.K. ... Concurrent therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and TNFα blockade in patients with gastrointestinal immune-related adverse events J. Immunother. Cancer. 2019; 7 :226 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ), and an increased TNFα-induced gene expression signature was observed in myeloid cells from +CPI colitis compared with control subjects ( Figure 6 C). IL-1 release is induced by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and we found that a signature representing regulation of inflammasome expression was higher in myeloid cells from +CPI colitis compared with control subjects ( Figures 7 H, 7I, S7 D, and S7E). We also examined a signature comprised of genes encoding the NLRP3 inflammasome core pathway, which was expressed in all myeloid cells but elevated in clusters 1 and 2 ( Figure S7 F). Single-cell analysis of IL1B and NLRP3 inflammasome core pathway genes showed highly significant co-expression ( Figure S7 G). In a recent clinical trial that evaluated the IL-1β blocking antibody canakinumab in patients with atherosclerosis, the incidence of newly diagnosed lung cancer and lung cancer mortality were significantly reduced in the canakinumab treatment arm compared with the placebo group ( Ridker et al., 2017 48. Ridker, P.M. ∙ MacFadyen, J.G. ∙ Thuren, T. ..., CANTOS Trial Group Effect of interleukin-1β inhibition with canakinumab on incident lung cancer in patients with atherosclerosis: exploratory results from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Lancet. 2017; 390 :1833-1842 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (940) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this mAb could also represent an opportunity for treatment of +CPI colitis.

Section: Discussion

This comprehensive single-cell analysis of +CPI colitis identified major changes in immune cell composition and effector programs underlying this common and severe irAE. TCRαβ analysis demonstrated a connectivity between CD8 Trm cells and emergence of cytotoxic effector cells in +CPI colitis patients. Colitis may be a relatively common and early irAE because a large number of such tissue-resident CD8 + T cells are already present in the healthy colon. We therefore hypothesize that activation of tissue-resident CD8 T cells plays an important role in colitis and that activation of such T cells induces subsequent recruitment of additional CD8 and CD4 T cell populations from the blood.
The pronounced activation and proliferation of cytotoxic effector CD8 + T cells in +CPI colitis may in part explain the response to systemic corticosteroid therapy because corticosteroids induce apoptosis of activated T cells ( Herold et al., 2006 20. Herold, M.J. ∙ McPherson, K.G. ∙ Reichardt, H.M. Glucocorticoids in T cell apoptosis and function Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63 :60-72 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many other irAEs associated with CPIs also respond to corticosteroids, consistent with the hypothesis that highly activated T cells may also be present in other tissues affected by irAEs. The large fraction of cycling T cells in +CPI colitis may also explain the clinical observation that this irAE often occurs with rapid onset and escalates over a period of days rather than weeks, as is typical for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ( Dougan, 2017 11. Dougan, M. Checkpoint Blockade Toxicity and Immune Homeostasis in the Gastrointestinal Tract Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1547 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, tumor-infiltrating T cells are far less proliferative following checkpoint blockade because of T cell exhaustion ( McLane et al., 2019 41. McLane, L.M. ∙ Abdel-Hakeem, M.S. ∙ Wherry, E.J. CD8 T Cell Exhaustion During Chronic Viral Infection and Cancer Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 37 :457-495 Crossref Scopus (1114) PubMed Google Scholar ). This lower proliferative capacity may explain why anti-tumor effects of checkpoint blockade are not fully abrogated by systemic corticosteroid exposure. Nevertheless, some deleterious effects of prolonged high-dose corticosteroids on anti-tumor immunity are likely, underscoring the importance of identifying alternative therapeutic targets.
Recent single-cell analyses of intestinal Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) lesions provide an opportunity for comparison with +CPI colitis ( Martin et al., 2019 37. Martin, J.C. ∙ Chang, C. ∙ Boschetti, G. ... Single-Cell Analysis of Crohn’s Disease Lesions Identifies a Pathogenic Cellular Module Associated with Resistance to Anti-TNF Therapy Cell. 2019; 178 :1493-1508.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (462) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smillie et al., 2019 53. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ). Proliferating T cells were increased in UC, Crohn’s disease, and +CPI colitis compared with healthy colon tissue; however, their elevation was most pronounced in +CPI colitis. T cell cytokine profiles also showed substantial differences between these forms of colitis; UC was characterized by an increase in IL-17 + CD8 T cells, whereas IL-17 expression was unchanged in +CPI colitis. In contrast, T cell IFNγ expression and IFNγ-inducible genes were strongly increased in +CPI colitis compared with control subjects. In UC and Crohn’s disease, there was a shift from IgA + to IgG + plasma B cells that was not observed in +CPI colitis, which may be related to differences in underlying mechanisms and disease state. These data suggest that there are important differences in T cell functional states, T cell cytokine expression programs, and B cell-mediated immunity between IBD and +CPI colitis.
Colitis-associated T cell populations expressed high levels of CXCR6 and CXCR3 chemokine receptor genes. CXCL16 , which encodes the ligand for CXCR6, was expressed by colonic myeloid cells and mast cells, and its expression is known to be regulated by IFNγ and TNFα. CXCR6 and CXCL16 are potential targets for the treatment of colitis, in particular because this chemokine-receptor pair also contributes to tumor cell metastasis ( Xiao et al., 2015 62. Xiao, G. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Wang, J. ... CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine signaling mediates breast cancer progression by pERK1/2-dependent mechanisms Oncotarget. 2015; 6 :14165-14178 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). CXCL9 and CXCL10, the ligands for CXCR3, are induced by IFNγ, and the corresponding genes were overexpressed by myeloid cells in colitis versus control subjects. However, CXCL9 and CXCL10 have been shown to be important for recruiting effector T cells to tumors, and blockade of either chemokine or IFNγ would be expected to have negative effects on anti-tumor immunity ( Groom and Luster, 2011 17. Groom, J.R. ∙ Luster, A.D. CXCR3 ligands: redundant, collaborative and antagonistic functions Immunol. Cell Biol. 2011; 89 :207-215 Crossref Scopus (723) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, recruitment of lymphocytes into the gut is dependent on binding of the α4β7 integrin to MadCAM on the gut endothelium ( Neurath, 2019 44. Neurath, M.F. Targeting immune cell circuits and trafficking in inflammatory bowel disease Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :970-979 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inhibition of α4β7 integrin using the mAb vedolizumab is effective for treatment of IBD and appears to have efficacy in patients with +CPI colitis who failed to respond to corticosteroids ( Abu-Sbeih et al., 2018 1. Abu-Sbeih, H. ∙ Ali, F.S. ∙ Alsaadi, D. ... Outcomes of vedolizumab therapy in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis: a multi-center study J. Immunother. Cancer. 2018; 6 :142 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, we observed expression of both genes ( ITGA4 and ITGB7 ) encoding the α4β7 integrin receptor in T cells from multiple T cell clusters, including colitis-associated clusters. Retention of lymphocytes in the gut mucosa is dependent on αEβ7 integrin ( Neurath, 2019 44. Neurath, M.F. Targeting immune cell circuits and trafficking in inflammatory bowel disease Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :970-979 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we observed high-level expression of the ITGAE gene in colitis-associated T cell clusters (in particular CD8 + T cells), suggesting that this integrin may be another potential therapeutic target. A mAb targeting the β7 integrin chain shared by α4β7 and α E β7 receptors is under clinical development (e.g., NCT02394028 and NCT02136069) and may be particularly effective for treatment of +CPI colitis.
The findings described here may have broad relevance for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of other irAEs triggered by checkpoint blockade, in particular those occurring in epithelia infiltrated even in the healthy state by substantial populations of lymphocytes. Histological analysis of two cases with severe colitis following treatment with anti-PD-1 monotherapy demonstrated infiltration of the mucosa by CD8 + T cells and T-bet + CD4 + T cells, consistent with our findings for patients who received combination CPI ( Yoshino et al., 2019 63. Yoshino, K. ∙ Nakayama, T. ∙ Ito, A. ... Severe colitis after PD-1 blockade with nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients: potential role of Th1-dominant immune response in immune-related adverse events: two case reports BMC Cancer. 2019; 19 :1019 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, fatal myocarditis in two melanoma patients treated with combination CPI was associated with robust infiltration of the myocardium by CD3 + and CD8 + T cells as well as macrophages ( Johnson et al., 2016 25. Johnson, D.B. ∙ Balko, J.M. ∙ Compton, M.L. ... Fulminant Myocarditis with Combination Immune Checkpoint Blockade N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375 :1749-1755 Crossref Scopus (1675) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data provide a rich source for identification of therapeutic targets for +CPI colitis and other irAEs, as illustrated by the identified chemokines, cytokines, and cell surface receptors.

Biopsy samples were obtained from CPI-treated melanoma patients undergoing a diagnostic endoscopy procedure at Massachusetts General Hospital or Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Prior to the procedure, patients provided informed consent for collection of additional research biopsies, in accordance with IRB-approved protocols (DF/HCC 15-302, 18-080, 11-181, and 18-498). Histological analysis of biopsies was performed following endoscopy, at which time patients were assigned to either +CPI colitis or +CPI no colitis patient groups. As an additional control group, healthy age-matched adults were consented prior to a regular screening colonoscopy procedure (DF/HCC 15-302 and 18-080). Subjects included both males and females spanning an age range of 21-78 years, and details on individual patients can be found in Table S1 . In all cases, biopsies were obtained during endoscopy using a standard-of-care forceps, spanning the regions from the descending colon, sigmoidal colon, and rectum; for two patients, C2 and NC2, biopsies from the ascending colon were also collected. Typically, 2-6 biopsies from each region were separately allocated into DMEM media and transported on ice to the lab for immediate tissue dissociation. For some patients (n = 4 control, n = 1 +CPI no colitis), descending, sigmoid, and rectum biopsies were collected as a single pool rather than separately from each region.
When biopsies were collected from multiple subregions, we combined main colon biopsies (descending colon for all patients except for C2 and NC2, from whom ascending biopsies were also combined) and sigmoid plus rectum biopsies to make two pools. Biopsies were transferred to 6 cm tissue culture dishes placed on ice and cut into < 1 mm pieces with a razor blade while immersed in a small volume in DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific # 11995073) to preserve tissue hydration. Tissue pieces were centrifuged (400 g for 5 min at 4°C for all centrifuge steps) and resuspended in 2 mL of collagenase-containing enzymatic digestion solution prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Human Tumor Dissociation Kit #30-095-929). Biopsies were incubated at 37°C for 25-30 min with mixing using a P1000 pipet tip (10-minute intervals) and intervening gentle vortexing (2-5-minute intervals). Digestion produced a nearly uniform single cell suspension which was passed through a 70 μm nylon mesh filter. Filtered cell suspensions were centrifuged and resuspended in 3 mL ACK red blood cell lysis buffer (GIBCO #A1049201) for 1 minute at RT, then immediately diluted with 10 mL of PBS buffer containing 0.5% FBS (Life Technologies# 10437028) and 1 mM EDTA to halt osmotic stress. Cells were centrifuged and subsequently resuspended in Zombie NIR (Biolegend #423106) viability dye solution (1:500 in PBS), followed by 15 min incubation at RT in the dark. Cells were counted with a hemocytometer, generally yielding > 100,000 live cells per individual biopsy. Following viability dye staining, cells were allocated for sorting/single-cell RNA-seq or spectral flow cytometry.
For patients with biopsies spanning multiple regions, descending colon and sigmoid-rectum cell suspensions were combined in equal numbers to provide an aggregate analysis of the lower colon. Cells stained with viability dye (0.4-0.6 × 10 6 ) were resuspended in 100 μL of FACS wash buffer (FWB; PBS, 2%FBS, 1 mM EDTA) with the addition of the following antibodies: TruStain FcX (Biolegend 422302), CD3-PE/Dazzle (Biolegend 300450), CD45-Pacific Blue (Biolegend 304022), CD66b-PE/Cy7 (Biolegend 305116) and CD15-APC (Biolegend 301908). Cells were incubated on ice for 20 minutes, washed with 1 mL FWB, and then resuspended in 500 μL FWB for sorting on a FACS Aria II or III (BD Biosciences). For the majority of samples, 12-15 × 10 3 live CD45 + CD66b - mononuclear cells (MNC) cells and CD3 + cells (pre-gated on live MNC) were separately sorted into T cell media (RMPI + 10% FBS) and immediately transferred to ice. CD66b+ granulocytes were excluded from the analysis because these cells interfere with scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics protocol.
Sorted cells were centrifuged and washed with PBS containing 0.05% RNase-free BSA (ThermoFisher Scientific #AM2616), leaving a final volume of < 31 μL. CD3 + and CD45 + MNC cells were loaded into separate channels of a Single Cell Chip A, along with reverse transcriptase reagent mixture and 5′ gel beads according to manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics). Chips were loaded into the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller for single-cell partitioning. Emulsions were immediately recovered from the chip and incubated in a deep-well block Thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for the reverse transcription reaction.
All steps from cDNA isolation to library preparation were completed as per manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated cDNA was amplified (14 cycles), after which cDNA was allocated for TCR enrichment/library preparation with the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J TCR kit, or for preparation of a gene expression library. cDNA and library quality was evaluated using the D5000 and D1000 high-sensitivity kits on a 2200 TapeStation system (Agilent).
We also prepared custom γδ TCR-enriched libraries. From amplified cDNA, we performed 2 rounds of PCR enrichment of γδ TCR genes used nested primers annealing to TRGC1/2 and TRDC (1 μM each in reaction). Forward primers were the same as used for αβ TCR enrichment as described in the manufacturer’s technical protocol: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTC for the first-round PCR and AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCT for the second-round PCR, both at 2 μM. PCR reaction conditions, purification steps, and library preparation were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for TCR V(D)J enrichment.

CD3 + T cell gene expression libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with 150 bp paired-end read configuration. CD45+ MNC libraries were sequenced either on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with 150 bp paired-end read configuration or the HisSeq 2500 platform on rapid run mode. We obtained > 30,000 reads per cell for all samples, which was particularly important with CD45+ libraries for sufficient sampling of non-immunoglobulin genes given the high plasma B cell count. TCR V(D)J libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (V2 flowcell), HiSeq 2500, or HiSeq 4000 platform, all on 150 bp paired-end read configuration.
Viability dye-stained cells (0.1-1 x10 6 ) from the combined descending and sigmoid-rectum colon cell suspensions were centrifuged and resuspended in 50-100 μL FWB to a density of 0.2-1x10 7 cells/mL in V-bottom plates. The following antibodies for cell surface epitope staining were added, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. Flow cytometry antibodies - surface staining Reagent Dilution Supplier Catalog Number BV421 anti-γδ TCR 1:20 Biolegend 331218 Pacific Blue anti-CD45 1:40 Biolegend 304022 BV510 anti-CD14, CD15, CD64, CD163 (Dump mixture) 1:80 each Biolegend, BD 301842, 323028, 563459, 333628 BV570 anti-CD8α 1:40 Biolegend 301038 BV605 anti-CD103 1:40 Biolegend 350217 BV785 anti-Vα7.2 TCR 1:20 Biolegend 351722 Alexa Fluor 532 anti-CD3 1:40 eBioscience 58-0038-42 PE anti-CD69 1:40 Biolegend 310906 PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-CD161 1:20 Biolegend 339908 Alexa Fluor 700 anti-CD4 1:20 eBioscience 56-0049-42 Open table in a new tab
Following incubation, cells were washed twice with 150-200 μL FWB before proceeding to intracellular staining. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized with the FoxP3/transcription factor buffer staining set (eBioscience) for 20 min at RT. Cells were washed twice with 1x permeabilization buffer before proceeding to intracellular staining with the following antibodies diluted in 1X permeabilization buffer.

Cells were stained for 20 min at RT in the dark, and then washed twice with 1X permeabilization buffer. Stained cells were resuspended in 300 μL FWB and stored at 4°C protected from light until analysis within 48 hours.
Stained cells were passed through a 40 μm filter and analyzed with a Sony SP6800 Spectral Analyzer. Single-color controls for spectral unmixing, using the identical antibodies as for analysis, were acquired using OneComp eBeads (ThermoFisher 01-1111-41) and fixed when applicable to match experimental conditions. The single-color control for Zombie NIR viability dye was acquired with PBMCs. Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star) version 10.4. Gating was confirmed with fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls from patient biopsy cell suspensions for low-density antigens, or a mixture of activated PBMC and Caco-2 colon cells for highly expressed antigens given the limited number of cells available from biopsies.
For cases (six from each patient group) with separately collected biopsies from multiple regions, we stained and analyzed descending colon (in 2 cases also including ascending colon) and sigmoid plus rectum separately. There were no significant regional variations in T cell populations, thus for analysis we used an average of these regions for comparison to patients from whom regional biopsies had been combined during initial collection.
Flow analysis included 3 additional patients not included in the scRNA-seq analysis. These comprised one +CPI no colitis patient and two healthy control subjects. Analysis of samples was performed over a 14-month period, and changes were made to the antibody panel after the initial patients to enable validation of key findings from the scRNA-seq data analysis. For patients C1 and C2, anti-Ki-67 and anti-CD103 were not included in the panel. For patients C3, NC1, NC2, and NC3, anti-Ki67 was not included in the panel. For patients C1 and C2, FITC-conjugated anti-CTLA-4 was used, which could not be clearly resolved during analysis and was exchanged with Pe-Cy7-conjugated anti-CTLA-4. These variations are reflected in sample numbers for corresponding flow analyses shown in the figures. Mean fluorescence intensities for parameters were only compared among patients with identical antibody panels and instrument configurations.
Sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were cut at a thickness of 4μm, de-paraffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. Antigen retrieval using EDTA (Dako, S2367) was performed at 120°C for 20 minutes using a bench-top thermal processor (Electron Microscopy Services, 62706). Subsequent multiplex immunofluorescence staining was performed using a Leica BOND RX automated staining instrument (Leica Biosystems). Following protein block (ARD1001EA, Akoya Biosciences), primary antibodies (anti-CD3, Dako M7254; anti-CD4, Cell Marque EP204; anti-FOXP3, BioLegend 206D; anti-CD8, Dako M7103; anti-Ki67, ThermoFisher MA5-14520; Pan-cytokeratin, Dako M3515 and Cell Signaling CST4545) were each sequentially applied for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by a 10 minute incubation with a secondary antibody (ARH1001EA, Akoya Biosciences) and subsequent detection via tyramide-signal amplification and an Opal fluorophore for 10 minutes (CD3 Opal 540; CD4 Opal 520; FOXP3 Opal 570; CD8 Opal 650; Ki67 Opal 690 and Pan-cytokeratin Opal 620). After each round of detection, heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed on the autostainer using sodium citrate, pH 6 (Leica Biosystems, AR9961). After the final immunofluorescence staining round, DAPI (Akoya Biosciences, FP1490) was applied for 10 minutes. Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade (ThermoFisher Scientific, P36935). Whole slide overview images at 10x magnification were obtained using a Vectra 3.0 multispectral imaging system (Akoya Biosciences) and were used to select representative regions for multispectral imaging at 20x. Following generation of a spectral library using single color and unstained controls, multispectral unmixing was performed using the inForm software package (Akoya Biosciences, v2.4).
Statistical analyses of flow cytometry data were performed with Prism 8.4.1 (GraphPad). The number of n, which represents the number of individual patients analyzed, is shown in the figure legends with details in Table S5 . The Bartlett’s test for equal variances was applied to the datasets to determine whether the standard deviations among comparison groups were significantly similar, informing which analyses were appropriate. The statistical method for each analysis is shown in the figure legends, and all analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons when appropriate. The mean and standard deviation is displayed in all plots ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
Raw single-cell RNA-seq data were processed using 10X Genomics Cell Ranger (v3.0.2), including demultiplexing the FASTQ reads, aligning them to the human reference genome (GRCh38, v3.0.0, from 10X Genomics), and counting the unique molecular identifier (UMI) (by using “cellranger count” function). All patient samples from each dataset were then aggregated by using the “cellranger aggr” function without depth normalization. As a result, a digital cell by gene expression matrix was generated, containing the number of UMIs for each gene detected in each cell. In addition, we carried out a number of steps to filter out poor quality data. First, we removed cells with high mitochondrial gene expression because damaged and dead cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination ( Ilicic et al., 2016 24. Ilicic, T. ∙ Kim, J.K. ∙ Kolodziejczyk, A.A. ... Classification of low quality cells from single-cell RNA-seq data Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :29 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, we fit the expression level of mitochondrial genes by using a median-centered median absolute deviation (MAD)-variance normal distribution, and then removed the cells with significantly higher expression levels than expected (determined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p < 0.01, for CD3+ dataset: 11.13%; for CD45+ dataset: 13.33%) ( Pijuan-Sala et al., 2019 45. Pijuan-Sala, B. ∙ Griffiths, J.A. ∙ Guibentif, C. ... A single-cell molecular map of mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :490-495 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, we removed cells for which less than 200 genes were detected. Third, we identified and removed potential doublets by using DoubletFinder (v2.0.2), using 92.5 th percentile of the doublet score as cutoff ( McGinnis et al., 2019 39. McGinnis, C.S. ∙ Murrow, L.M. ∙ Gartner, Z.J. DoubletFinder: Doublet Detection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Using Artificial Nearest Neighbors Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :329-337.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1324) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the end, we retained a total of 68,728 and 51,652 single cells for the CD3+ and CD45+ cell datasets, respectively.
The processed whole gene expression matrix with all selected cells was fed to Seurat (v3.1.0, R package) for downstream analyses ( Stuart et al., 2019 55. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7323) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, only genes expressed in more than 10 cells were kept, and the UMI count matrix was normalized by using ‘NormalizeData’ function, in which the number of UMI for each gene was divided by the total number of UMI in each cell and multiplied by a scale factor of 10,000, followed by adding a pseudocount 1 for each gene and natural-log transformation. Based on the normalized gene expression matrix, 2,000 highly variable genes were identified by using the ‘FindVariableFeatures’ function with the ‘vst’ method for both CD3+ and CD45+ datasets. In order to avoid the dominant effect of T cell receptor variable genes, as these genes usually show very high expression level in subpopulations of cells, in the determination of T cell clusters, TCR genes ( TRAV , TRBV , TRDV and TRGV genes) were removed from the clustering analysis of the CD3+ dataset. In addition to the T cell receptor variable genes, the immunoglobulin variable (IG[X]V genes) genes were also removed from the highly variable genes in CD45+ dataset in clustering analysis. ‘ScaleData’ function was then used to scale and center the gene expression matrix after regressing out the heterogeneity associated with the mitochondrial contamination. To perform the clustering analysis, the first 20 principal components were selected for constructing the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph by using ‘FindNeighbors’ function, and then Louvain clustering algorithm was used to group the cells into different clusters ( Blondel et al., 2008 7. Blondel, V.D. ∙ Guillaume, J.-L. ∙ Lambiotte, R. ... Fast unfolding of communities in large networks J. Stat. Mech. 2008; 2008 :P10008 Crossref Scopus (13969) Google Scholar ). For the CD3+ dataset, we removed four small clusters which did not express T cell marker genes ( CD3D , CD3E and CD3G ) and performed the clustering analysis again based on the remaining cells (67,926 cells).
We used two complementary approaches to annotate the identities of different cell clusters: (1) we checked whether the well-studied marker genes of different immune cell types were in the top rank of differential expressed genes of query cluster and then assigned the most likely identity for each cell cluster; (2) applied an unbiased cell type recognition method named SingleR (v0.99.10, R package) ( Aran et al., 2019 3. Aran, D. ∙ Looney, A.P. ∙ Liu, L. ... Reference-based analysis of lung single-cell sequencing reveals a transitional profibrotic macrophage Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :163-172 Crossref Scopus (1976) PubMed Google Scholar ), which leverages reference transcriptomic datasets of known cell types for annotation ( Martin et al., 2019 37. Martin, J.C. ∙ Chang, C. ∙ Boschetti, G. ... Single-Cell Analysis of Crohn’s Disease Lesions Identifies a Pathogenic Cellular Module Associated with Resistance to Anti-TNF Therapy Cell. 2019; 178 :1493-1508.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (462) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smillie et al., 2019 53. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; 178 :714-730.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first applied SingleR to determine if the predicted annotations for a query cluster based on different reference datasets were consistent, and then assigned this cluster as the predicted cell type annotation; alternatively, we checked which genes were in the top rank of differentially expressed gene list of this cluster. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was applied to visualize the single cell transcriptional profile in 2D space based on the SNN graph described above ( Becht et al., 2018 6. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37 :38-44 Crossref Scopus (2577) Google Scholar ; McInnes et al., 2018 40. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2018; 1802.03426 https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426 Google Scholar ). Other bar plots, boxplots, violin plots and heatmaps were generated by customized R code through ggplot2 (v3.2.1, R package) ( Wickham, 2016 61. Wickham, H. ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis Springer, 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ).
To analyze CD3+ T cells in detail, we split the CD3+ T cell dataset into CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets according to the mutually exclusive expression of CD4 (CD4 > 1 and CD8A < 1) and CD8A (CD4 < 1 and CD8A > 1) genes (based on normalized expression), and then applied the pipelines as described above, with the modification that 1,500 highly variable genes were selected to identify, annotate and visualize the cell clusters. We also used the same steps to perform the sub-clustering analysis for the Treg cell cluster (from CD4+ subset) and myeloid cell cluster (from CD45+ cell dataset). In the CD8+ dataset, we observed slight patient-specific batch effects as evidenced by clusters containing cells from only a single patient or fraction of patients, likely caused by technical differences. To correct this, we regressed out the unwanted source of technical variation by implementing the ‘ScaleData’ function before cell clustering.
To make the number of cells from different patients in each cluster comparable in CD3+, CD45+ datasets and other subsets, we first normalized the number of cells for each patient to the median of patients’ total number of cells. Then the percentages of cells from different patients were calculated in each cluster and the two-sided Wilcoxon test was applied to obtain the P values between control and colitis groups. The clusters with P value < 0.05 were assigned as colitis-associated clusters.
Differentially expressed genes in different clusters were identified by ‘FindAllMarkers’ function (use default parameters but set min.pct as 0.3) in Seurat. We also calculated a cell-type specificity score based on our previously described Jensen-Shannon Divergence algorithm for each identified differentially expressed gene and visualized the top ranked genes in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets ( Suo et al., 2018 56. Suo, S. ∙ Zhu, Q. ∙ Saadatpour, A. ... Revealing the Critical Regulators of Cell Identity in the Mouse Cell Atlas Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :1436-1445.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to identify colitis-related differentially expressed genes in CD4+ or CD8+ subsets, we combined colitis-associated clusters together and then compared with other clusters by using ‘FindMarkers’ function in Seurat with default parameters but set min.pct as 0.3 and logfc.threshold as 0. Within the myeloid cluster, we used the same approach but compared cells from the CPI colitis group with cells from control or +CPI no colitis groups to identify colitis-related genes.
We used a fast per-ranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) named fgsea (v1.11.1, R package) to perform functional enrichment analysis for colitis-related differentially expressed genes ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 28. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ). First we downloaded the hallmark gene sets from Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB; https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp ; Liberzon et al., 2015 34. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6409) PubMed Google Scholar ), and then fed each differentially expressed gene list together with averaged log (fold-change) of each gene and the hallmark gene sets to the ‘fgsea’ function (minSize = 15, maxSize = 1000, nperm = 1000). Finally, only hallmark gene sets with adjusted P value < 0.05 were selected as the functionally enriched biological states or processes.
RNA velocity is widely used to infer the directionality and future state of individual cells by distinguishing un-spliced and spliced mRNAs from single-cell RNA-seq data. To analyze the expression dynamics in CD8+ or CD4+ T cell subsets, we applied the velocyto (v0.17.17, python package) to estimate the RNA velocity of single cells by distinguishing spliced and un-spliced mRNAs ( La Manno et al., 2018 31. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1954) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first generated the individual loom file based on the output file of Cell Ranger for each patient sample and then merged all loom files together. Then we fed the merged loom files and the UMAP coordinates of single cells generated by Seurat to velocyto and followed its analysis steps to finally project the RNA velocity vectors onto low-dimension embeddings.
Raw T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data were processed by using 10X Genomics Cell Ranger (v3.1.0). Briefly, FASTQ reads were aligned to human GRCh38 V(D)J reference genome (v3.1.0, from 10X Genomics) by using the “cellranger vdj” function, resulting in the assembly of V(D)J sequences and clonotypes ( Yost et al., 2019 64. Yost, K.E. ∙ Satpathy, A.T. ∙ Wells, D.K. ... Clonal replacement of tumor-specific T cells following PD-1 blockade Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1251-1259 Crossref Scopus (881) PubMed Google Scholar ). On average, 5,988 read pairs were detected per cell in each patient sample. 95.36% (and 98.61%, respectively) of CD3+ cells were associated with at least one productive TRA ( TRB , respectively) rearrangement. The filtered contig annotations, which contained high-level annotations of each high-confident cellular contig, were further filtered by removing the records with ‘raw_consensus_id’ as ‘none’. Of all detected clonotypes, 81.22% contained one TRA and one TRB sequences, and 10.23% contained two TRA and one TRB sequences. Only 1.78% of clonotypes contained one TRA and two TRB sequences and only 1.47% of clonotypes had two TRA and two TRB sequences on average. In total, 91.23% of all CD3+ T cells could be assigned an αβ TCR sequence. Within the CD4+ and CD8+ datasets, TCR sequences could be detected in 98.88% and 91.04% of cells, respectively. The CD3+ and CD8+ datasets contain additional cells lacking αβ TCRs, such as CD4-CD8- and CD8+ γδ T cells, respectively, which account for the lower % of cells.
Raw γδ TCR sequencing data were processed using 10X Genomics Cell Ranger VDJ (v3.0.0) aligned to the GRCh38 V(D)J reference genome (v3.1.0, from 10X Genomics). Prevalence of TRDV gene usage was determined among bona fide γδ T cells containing both productive TRG and TRD rearrangements, as many αβ T cells also productively rearrange the TRG loci as previously reported and evident in our data ( Sherwood et al., 2011 51. Sherwood, A.M. ∙ Desmarais, C. ∙ Livingston, R.J. ... Deep sequencing of the human TCRγ and TCRβ repertoires suggests that TCRβ rearranges after αβ and γδ T cell commitment Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3 :90ra61 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ).
On average, we could detect 1,967 unique αβ TCR clonotypes in each patient (ranging from 1,247 to 2,678 among all patient samples). For the total 43,262 unique clonotypes detected in all patient samples, clonotype size ranged from 1 to 446 cells and 12.29% of clonotypes were expanded. An expanded clonotype was defined as a clonotype that could be detected in at least two cells. In the CD4+ or CD8+ T cell subsets, we further separated TCR clonotypes into the three corresponding patient groups (+CPI colitis, +CPI no colitis, control). A shared clonotype was defined as a TCR that could be detected in at least one cell in two different clusters. In the CD4+ T cell subset, we identified 148, 93 and 62 shared clonotypes between any two clusters in control, +CPI no-colitis and +CPI colitis groups, respectively. In the CD8+ T cell subset, we identified 245, 148 and 867 shared clonotypes in control, +CPI no colitis and +CPI colitis groups, respectively. In order to statistically test the cluster relationships in terms of clonal expansion for all shared clonotypes, we counted the number of shared clonotypes among different clusters, and then applied the one-sided Fisher’s exact test (followed with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction) on 2 × 2 cluster-by-cluster contingency tables to evaluate the significance of clone sharing between clusters. Finally, Cytoscape was used to visualize clonotype sharing between different clusters, with the nodes representing the clusters and the lines reflecting the number of shared clonotypes as well as the statistical significance of clonotype sharing between two clusters ( Shannon et al., 2003 49. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (32540) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In order to evaluate whether a hallmark gene set or another related gene set was enriched among the top ranking expressed genes in each cell, we calculated a gene set activity score for each gene set by applying an area under the curve method named AUCell (v1.7.2, R package) ( Aibar et al., 2017 2. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (2533) PubMed Google Scholar ). For query gene set, we built the area under the recovery (AUC) curve based on the ranking of the top 1,500 genes in each single cell; the x axis is the ranking of expressed genes from high to low based on their expression values, and the y axis is the number of genes recovered from the query gene set. The gene set activity score is measured as the proportion of expressed genes in the query gene set and their relative expression levels compared to the other genes in each cell. NLRP3 inflammasome related gene sets used in the analyses included “GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_NLRP3_INFLAMMASOME_COMPLEX_ASSEMBLY” ( TLR6 , GBP5 , USP50 , DHX33 , TLR4 , ATAT1 , and CD36 ) from MSigDB GO gene sets ( Liberzon et al., 2015 34. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a custom gene set “NLRP3 inflammasome core pathway” ( IL1B , NLRP3 , PYCARD , CASP1 , GSDMD and IL18 ).
Guilt-by-association analysis was applied to evaluate the co-activation probability of IL1B gene expression and NLRP3 inflammasome core pathway activity in singe cells ( Walker et al., 1999 58. Walker, M.G. ∙ Volkmuth, W. ∙ Sprinzak, E. ... Prediction of gene function by genome-scale expression analysis: prostate cancer-associated genes Genome Res. 1999; 9 :1198-1203 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, for all myeloid cells from each patient group, the expression values of IL1B gene and activity scores of NLRP3 inflammasome core pathway were first z-score-normalized across all cells, respectively. Then a binary vector was constructed for each of the normalized vectors with the following strategy: the binary value was set to 1 if the corresponding z-scored value > 0, otherwise the binary value was 0. Finally, the P value for observing co-activation of IL1B gene expression and NLRP3 inflammasome core pathway activity were determined by one-sided Fisher’s exact test based on a 2 × 2 contingency table generated from the binary vectors.
We examined the interaction of different cell types based on the expression level of ligand-receptor pairs in the CD45+ dataset. The specific ligand-receptor pairs were analyzed separately for chemokines ( CCL17-CCR4, CCL22-CCR4, CCL3-CCR5, CCL4-CCR5, CCL5-CCR5, CCL20-CCR6, CCL19-CCR7, CCL21-CCR7, CXCL9-CXCR3, CXCL10-CXCR3, CXCL11-CXCR3, CXCL12-CXCR4, CXCL13-CXCR5, CXCL16-CXCR6, XCL1-XCR1, XCL2-XCR1 ) and cytokines ( AREG-EGFR, CSF2-CSF2RA, IFNG-IFNGR1, IL10-IL10RA/B, IL12-IL12RA, IL12A-IL12RB1, IL15-IL15RA, IL17A-IL17RA, IL17F-IL17RA, IL18-IL18R, IL1B-IL1R1, IL2-IL2RA/B/G, IL21-IL21R, IL22-IL22RA1, IL23-IL23R, IL6-IL6R, IL7-IL7R, LTB-LTBR, TNF-TNFRSF1A, TGFB1-TGFBR1/2 ). To test whether the sender cell cluster is significantly communicated with the receiver cell cluster from the expression level of their ligand and receptor genes, we first averaged the normalized expression value of each ligand gene in cluster i as E L,i and receptor gene in cluster j as E R,j , and then inferred that cluster i could interact with cluster j if the E L,i > 1 and E R,j > 1. The circlize (v0.4.8, R package) was used to visualize the interaction of different clusters ( Gu et al., 2014 19. Gu, Z. ∙ Gu, L. ∙ Eils, R. ... circlize Implements and enhances circular visualization in R Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2811-2812 Crossref Scopus (2254) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a more quantitative metric, we defined the ligand-receptor score as S L,R = E L,i ∗ E R,j with E L,i > 1 and E R,j > 1 and applied a permutation test to evaluate whether the inferred cluster interaction was statistically significant ( Martin et al., 2019 37. Martin, J.C. ∙ Chang, C. ∙ Boschetti, G. ... Single-Cell Analysis of Crohn’s Disease Lesions Identifies a Pathogenic Cellular Module Associated with Resistance to Anti-TNF Therapy Cell. 2019; 178 :1493-1508.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (462) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we first shuffled the cluster identity of each cell randomly for 10,000 times with the size of each cluster consistent with the truth, and then calculated the ligand-receptor scores again based on permutated data. Finally, a permutation P value was evaluated as the number of times that S random > S tru e divided by 10,000.
