Title: Identification of ALK in Thinness


Abstract: Summary

There is considerable inter-individual variability in susceptibility to weight gain despite an equally obesogenic environment in large parts of the world. Whereas many studies have focused on identifying the genetic susceptibility to obesity, we performed a GWAS on metabolically healthy thin individuals (lowest 6 th percentile of the population-wide BMI spectrum) in a uniquely phenotyped Estonian cohort. We discovered anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) as a candidate thinness gene. In Drosophila , RNAi mediated knockdown of Alk led to decreased triglyceride levels. In mice, genetic deletion of Alk resulted in thin animals with marked resistance to diet- and leptin-mutation-induced obesity. Mechanistically, we found that ALK expression in hypothalamic neurons controls energy expenditure via sympathetic control of adipose tissue lipolysis. Our genetic and mechanistic experiments identify ALK as a thinness gene, which is involved in the resistance to weight gain.

Section: Introduction

The prevalence of obesity and health-associated complications continue to rise throughout the world ( Abarca-Gómez et al., 2017 1. Abarca-Gómez, L. ∙ Abdeen, Z.A. ∙ Hamid, Z.A. ..., NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) Worldwide trends in body-mass index, underweight, overweight, and obesity from 1975 to 2016: a pooled analysis of 2416 population-based measurement studies in 128·9 million children, adolescents, and adults Lancet. 2017; 390 :2627-2642 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1518) PubMed Google Scholar ). Body mass index (BMI), commonly used to classify weight categories, is a highly complex trait that integrates the action of many genes and environmental cues ( Maes et al., 1997 63. Maes, H.H.M. ∙ Neale, M.C. ∙ Eaves, L.J. Genetic and environmental factors in relative body weight and human adiposity Behav. Genet. 1997; 27 :325-351 Crossref Scopus (1055) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent developments of large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic variants involved in polygenic obesity ( Locke et al., 2015 57. Locke, A.E. ∙ Kahali, B. ∙ Berndt, S.I. ..., LifeLines Cohort Study, ADIPOGen Consortium, AGEN-BMI Working Group, CARDIOGRAMplusC4D Consortium, CKDGen Consortium, GLGC, ICBP, MAGIC Investigators, MuTHER Consortium, MIGen Consortium, PAGE Consortium, ReproGen Consortium, GENIE Consortium, International Endogene Consortium Genetic studies of body mass index yield new insights for obesity biology Nature. 2015; 518 :197-206 Crossref Scopus (1732) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the fact that more than 700 common SNPs have been linked to BMI ( Yengo et al., 2018a 105. Yengo, L. ∙ Sidorenko, J. ∙ Kemper, K.E. ...

Though most studies in the field have focused on the susceptibility to obesity, only few have explored the genetics of thinness, either in humans ( Bulik and Allison, 2001; Laskarzewski et al., 1983; Lu et al., 2016; Magnusson and Rasmussen, 2002; Ran et al., 2017; Riveros-McKay et al., 2019; Zillikens et al., 2017 10.

A polygenic model of the metabolic syndrome with reduced circulating and intra-adipose glucocorticoid action Diabetes. 2005; 54 :3371-3378 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, few of these studies provided any direct functional evidence linking human data to identification of potential gene(s) involved in the resistance to weight gain.
To further investigate the role of genetics in body weight regulation, we explored the human phenotype of persistent extreme low BMI (defined as BMI below the population-wide 6 th percentile, adjusted for gender and age, generally corresponding to BMI lower than 18 kg/m 2 ) ( Apfelbaum and Sachet, 1982; Estour et al., 2014 3. Apfelbaum, M. ∙ Sachet, P. [Constitutional thinness] Rev. Prat. 1982; 32 :245-247 PubMed Google Scholar 24. Estour, B. ∙ Galusca, B. ∙ Germain, N. Constitutional thinness and anorexia nervosa: a possible misdiagnosis? Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2014; 5 :175 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed a GWAS comparing thin with control individuals. We discovered that variants within the ALK gene are associated with the thinness phenotype. ALK is frequently mutated in various types of cancer ( Della Corte et al., 2018 19. Della Corte, C.M. ∙ Viscardi, G. ∙ Di Liello, R. ... Role and targeting of anaplastic lymphoma kinase in cancer Mol. Cancer. 2018; 17 :30 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), thereby having gained prominence as a key oncogenic driver; however, the physiological role of ALK outside of cancer has remained largely unclear. Using multiple independent genetic mouse models, we show that knock out of ALK results in thin animals resistant to diet-induced obesity with many striking similarities to the human thinness phenotype.

Section: Results

To identify variants associating with thinness, we performed a GWAS between groups belonging to different categories of the population-wide BMI spectrum in Estonia. The Estonian biobank (Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu; EGCUT) contains one of the largest and best phenotyped population cohort data in the world ( www.biobank.ee ), enabling us to use stringent and well-defined criteria that exclude samples from people with diseases such as lipodystrophy or anorexia nervosa ( Figure 1 A; see STAR Methods and Table S1 for detailed exclusion criteria). Population-wide BMI distributions are greatly affected by age and gender ( Bulik and Allison, 2001 10. Bulik, C.M. ∙ Allison, D.B. The genetic epidemiology of thinness Obes. Rev. 2001; 2 :107-115 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, rather than using strict BMI cutoffs, we selected individuals based on age- and gender-adjusted BMI. Control individuals were within the 30–50 th percentile, thin individuals belonged to the lowest 6 th percentile, and obese individuals to the highest 95 th percentile of the population-wide BMI range grouped by age and gender ( Figure S1 ). Based on these criteria, we classified ∼1.9% of the cohort as “thin individuals.”
Case-control GWAS analysis of the thin-versus-control individuals identified a distinct set of variants reaching p < 10 −5 ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ). When comparing control versus obese individuals in the EGCUT dataset, we found among the top variants the well-known BMI-associated variants such as FTO and MC4R ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). Of the top five genomic loci associating with thinness versus controls ( Table 1 ), two loci were located between genes (between ICE1 and MED10 , and FOS and TMED10 ). Furthermore, we found association of the thinness phenotype with a variant in an uncharacterized lncRNA (long non-coding RNA), AC013652.1. Two variants were located within genes: rs79938778 within DEPTOR and rs568057364 located in the first intron of ALK . Interestingly, the ALK rs568057364 variant is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with another thinness-associated ALK variant rs202021741 ( Figure 2 A; Table S1 ). Genotype frequencies of these two ALK variants in the thin and control group are shown in Figure S2 A. Principal component analysis of the two ALK variants identified in the Estonian population did not reveal abnormal stratification in different populations; both indels are common in European, Asian, as well as admixed American populations but less frequent in African ancestry populations ( Figure S2 B). DEPTOR is a negative regulator of the mTOR signaling pathway which, in mouse studies, was identified as a regulator of adipogenesis ( Laplante et al., 2012 48. Laplante, M. ∙ Horvat, S. ∙ Festuccia, W.T. ... DEPTOR cell-autonomously promotes adipogenesis, and its expression is associated with obesity Cell Metab. 2012; 16 :202-212 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in the protection against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity when overexpressed in the hypothalamus ( Caron et al., 2015 12. Caron, A. ∙ Labbé, S.M. ∙ Lanfray, D. ... Mediobasal hypothalamic overexpression of DEPTOR protects against high-fat diet-induced obesity Mol. Metab. 2015; 5 :102-112 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). ALK has been extensively studied in cancer, but little is known about the biological role of ALK outside the context of cancer.
Next, we used Drosophila genetics to prioritize potential genes for follow-up studies. We therefore determined whether the genes in the vicinity of the thinness variants regulate fat metabolism. Briefly, we identified 38 human genes that are within ∼1Mb of the top five thinness-associated loci, determined their orthologs in flies, performed RNAi-mediated knockdown in Drosophila , and evaluated the effect on whole-body triglyceride levels ( Figure 2 B; Table S2 ). Of the 24 orthologous genes, knockdown of 5 genes resulted in significantly lower triglyceride accumulation: the fly orthologs of the transcription factors ZC2HC1C (CG42675) and MEIS2 (hth), the metallopeptidase ADAMTS16 (AdamTS-A), the DNA polymerase PAPD7 (Trf4-2) involved in DNA repair, and, importantly, ALK (Alk). In multiple repeat experiments, we confirmed that knockdown of Alk results in reduced triglyceride levels using normal- as well as high-sucrose diets ( Figure 2 C). Of note, Alk RNAi flies showed normal food intake but exhibited a mild reduction in lifespan compared to the parental control Actin-Gal4 line ( Figures S2 C and S2D), indicating metabolic dysregulation. Overexpression of Alk had no apparent effect on triglyceride levels and lifespan ( Figures S2 E and S2F). Thus, knockdown of fly orthologs of genes near the human GWAS variants from the Estonian thinness cohort affect triglyceride levels in Drosophila .
As a next prioritization step for these five candidate genes, we queried GWAS data as well as prior metabolic phenome-wide associations ( Table S2 ). We found that only two of these five genes have been associated with defined metabolic traits. For MEIS2 , one metabolic trait (waist circumference) has been reported. Importantly, our data mining showed that multiple metabolic traits have been associated with the ALK locus, including BMI, plasma triglyceride levels, plasma LDL cholesterol levels, glucose homeostasis, plasma adiponectin levels, and glycated hemoglobin ( Figure 2 A; Table S2 ). Of note, applying the same stringent selection criteria of our GWAS (6 th percentile lowest BMI and exclusion criteria) to the UKBB data to categorize thin individuals, we found no significant association with thinness for the two ALK variants (imputation score > 90% for both indels) identified in the Estonian cohort. However, the association of other variants within the ALK locus with BMI was found in two major, publicly available resources, namely the UKBB and the GIANT consortium (see above). Thus, our new EGCUT data and mining of the GWAS catalog showed that several variants within ALK are associated with different metabolic traits such as thinness, BMI, and lipid and glucose homeostasis.
Given that we found that the ALK locus is associated with multiple metabolic phenotypes in human and that knockdown of Alk results in reduced triglyceride accumulation in the fly, we focused our functional characterization on this gene. ALK is a member of the insulin receptor superfamily ( Iwahara et al., 1997; Morris et al., 1994 43. Iwahara, T. ∙ Fujimoto, J. ∙ Wen, D. ...

Fusion of a kinase gene, ALK, to a nucleolar protein gene, NPM, in non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma Science. 1994; 263 :1281-1284 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), first described as an oncogene resulting from a t(2;5)(p23;q35) NPM1 / ALK chromosomal translocation in anaplastic large-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas ( Morris et al., 1994 69. Morris, S.W. ∙ Kirstein, M.N. ∙ Valentine, M.B. ... Fusion of a kinase gene, ALK, to a nucleolar protein gene, NPM, in non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma Science. 1994; 263 :1281-1284 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). More than 20 different ALK rearrangements and mutations have been reported in tumors including neuroblastomas and non-small cell lung cancers ( Della Corte et al., 2018; Hallberg and Palmer, 2016 19.

Hallberg, B. ∙ Palmer, R.H. The role of the ALK receptor in cancer biology Ann. Oncol. 2016; 27 :iii4-iii15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the expression of its mRNA throughout the nervous system during embryogenesis and also in the adult brain, mammalian ALK is thought to play a role in the development and function of the nervous system ( Iwahara et al., 1997; Vernersson et al., 2006 43.

However, besides subtle behavioral alterations observed in Alk deficient mice ( Bilsland et al., 2008; Lasek et al., 2011a; Mangieri et al., 2017; Weiss et al., 2012 9. Bilsland, J.G. ∙ Wheeldon, A. ∙ Mead, A. ...

Behav. 2012; 100 :566-574 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), these mice are viable and fertile, showing no obvious phenotypes. Interestingly, one study noted a small difference in body weight of Alk deficient mice but did not further explore these preliminary findings ( Bilsland et al., 2008 9. Bilsland, J.G. ∙ Wheeldon, A. ∙ Mead, A. ... Behavioral and neurochemical alterations in mice deficient in anaplastic lymphoma kinase suggest therapeutic potential for psychiatric indications Neuropsychopharmacology. 2008; 33 :685-700 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we performed an in-depth analysis of Alk knockout ( Alk −/− ) mice and also generated a new, independent mutant mouse line for tissue-specific Alk deletion to assess the role of ALK in metabolism.
Alk mutant mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio ( Figure S3 A), and loss of Alk had no apparent effect on anxiety (open field test); locomotion, coordination, and balance (rotarod test); pain perception (hot plate and tail flick tests); fertility; physical appearance; tissue morphology; blood composition; or serum chemistry ( Figures S3 B–S3E; Table S3 ). Next, we recorded body weights of male and female Alk +/+ and Alk −/− mice fed a standard chow diet (SD). Mice of both genotypes were born with similar weights but Alk −/− mice developed a thin phenotype at the age of 5 weeks, persisting into adulthood ( Figure 3 A; Figure S3 F) while body length was normal ( Figure S3 G). Analysis of lean and fat mass by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantification of epididymal and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (epWAT and scWAT) revealed a reduced body adiposity in Alk −/− compared to Alk +/+ mice while lean mass was similar ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Furthermore, adipocytes from Alk −/− epWAT and scWAT depots displayed a markedly reduced cell size ( Figure 3 D), indicating reduced lipid accumulation.
We examined the daily food intake of single housed Alk +/+ and Alk −/− mice over several weeks but did not observe a difference between genotypes ( Figure 3 E). Intestinal lipid absorption and levels of neutral sterols and bile acid content in the feces were unchanged in Alk −/− mice as compared to littermate controls ( Figures S3 H and S3I), suggesting normal intestinal digestion and absorption of fat in Alk -deficient mice. Daily activity was also not changed in Alk −/− mice ( Figure 3 F). In line with reduced body weight, Alk mutant mice exhibited improved glucose tolerance ( Figure 3 G). Notably, adiponectin levels were increased in Alk −/− mice ( Figure 3 H). Importantly, male Alk −/− mice housed at thermoneutrality (30°C), the optimal housing temperature to mimic the thermal environment of humans ( Fischer et al., 2018 25. Fischer, A.W. ∙ Cannon, B. ∙ Nedergaard, J. Optimal housing temperatures for mice to mimic the thermal environment of humans: An experimental study Mol. Metab. 2018; 7 :161-170 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed reduced weight gain compared to Alk +/+ mice ( Figure 3 I). These results, in line with our human GWAS and fly data, show that Alk −/− mice on standard chow diet exhibit a thin phenotype, elevated adiponectin levels, and improved glucose homeostasis, while having unaltered food intake and activity.
Constitutionally thin individuals show a resistance to weight gain following a fat overfeeding period ( Germain et al., 2014 30. Germain, N. ∙ Galusca, B. ∙ Caron-Dorval, D. ... Specific appetite, energetic and metabolomics responses to fat overfeeding in resistant-to-bodyweight-gain constitutional thinness Nutr. Diabetes. 2014; 4 :e126 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if Alk −/− mice resist weight gain, we mimicked caloric overload by challenging adult mice with a HFD for 16 weeks. Intriguingly, Alk knockout mice were significantly protected against HFD-induced obesity ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Of note, Alk +/− mice also showed reduced body weight gain on HFD compared to Alk +/+ mice (not shown), indicative of a gene-dosage effect. To confirm these findings in an independent Alk mutant mouse line, we generated Alk conditional knockout mice ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Floxed mice crossed to transgenic animals expressing Cre recombinase under the ubiquitous actin promoter ( Alk fl/fl ActinCre + ) recapitulated the resistance to HFD-induced obesity observed in conventional Alk −/− mice ( Figure 4 C). Moreover, similar to diet-induced obesity, Alk deficiency led to a significantly reduced weight gain in the genetic obesity model of leptin deficiency ( ob/ob ) ( Figure 4 D).
Next, we assessed body composition of mice by MRI. Alk −/− mice fed HFD displayed normal lean mass but a strong reduction in adiposity ( Figures 4 E–4G) and smaller adipocytes in both epWAT and scWAT compared to HFD-fed Alk +/+ mice ( Figure 4 H; Figure S4 C), while daily caloric intake of individually housed mice was not different ( Figure 4 I). In accordance with unaltered food intake but reduced weight gain, Alk -deficient mice showed reduced feeding efficiency ( Figure 4 J), a measure of mg body weight gain per kcal food intake. To unravel the resistance to diet-induced weight gain in Alk knockout mice, we measured energy expenditure (EE) using indirect calorimetry. Plotting of individual data points revealed that Alk −/− mice have an elevated daily EE compared to Alk +/+ mice ( Figure 4 K), suggesting excess catabolism as the potential cause of the adiposity resistant phenotype. We did not observe any apparent difference in daily circadian activity between the cohorts analyzed ( Figure S4 D). Glucose tolerance was markedly improved in Alk −/− mice versus Alk +/+ mice fed the HFD ( Figure S4 E). Plasma adiponectin levels were also increased in HFD-fed mutant mice ( Figure S4 F). Various ligands for ALK have been reported, including pleiotrophin ( Ptn ) ( Stoica et al., 2001 91. Stoica, G.E. ∙ Kuo, A. ∙ Aigner, A. ... Identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase as a receptor for the growth factor pleiotrophin J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :16772-16779 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ), midkine ( Mdk ) ( Stoica et al., 2002 92. Stoica, G.E. ∙ Kuo, A. ∙ Powers, C. ... Midkine binds to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and acts as a growth factor for different cell types J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :35990-35998 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ), heparin ( Murray et al., 2015 72. Murray, P.B. ∙ Lax, I. ∙ Reshetnyak, A. ... Heparin is an activating ligand of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase ALK Sci. Signal. 2015; 8 :ra6 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ALK and LTK ligand 1 and 2 ( Alkal1 and Alkal2 ) ( Guan et al., 2015 32. Guan, J. ∙ Umapathy, G. ∙ Yamazaki, Y. ... FAM150A and FAM150B are activating ligands for anaplastic lymphoma kinase eLife. 2015; 4 :e09811 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). We combined single and double mutants for Mdk and/or Ptn with Alk knockouts and found that loss of Alk still diminished HFD-induced obesity in the absence of both ligands ( Figures S4 G–S4I), suggesting that other ligands might be involved. Thus, Alk -deficient mice exhibit increased energy expenditure and are markedly protected against HFD- and genetically induced obesity.
To gain further insight into ALK-mediated control of weight gain, we examined Alk mRNA expression in a mouse tissue library and observed high levels of Alk mRNA in cerebellum, cortex, and especially hypothalamus of the central nervous system ( Figure S5 A). Notably, we did not detect Alk expression in key metabolic tissues such as liver, muscle, WAT, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) ( Figure S5 A). To further analyze Alk expression, we took advantage of the lacZ cassette inserted into the Alk locus in our conventional knockout mice ( Alk −/− ) . X-gal staining of Alk −/− mice revealed strong lacZ expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus ( Figure 5 A), a brain center where numerous afferent neuronal circuits converge to regulate energy balance via hormonal output pathways and sympathetic tone ( Cowley et al., 1999; Foster et al., 2010; Hill, 2012; Williams et al., 2001 15.

The hypothalamus and the control of energy homeostasis: different circuits, different purposes Physiol. Behav. 2001; 74 :683-701 Crossref Scopus (443) PubMed Google Scholar ). Comparable Alk expression in the PVN can also be seen in the Allen brain atlas ( http://mouse.brain-map.org/ ). Quantification of hypothalamic mRNA levels in fasted and refed Alk +/+ mice showed that Alk mRNA expression was induced in response to feeding ( Figure 5 B). In human, ALK is also highly expressed in the hypothalamus ( http://gtexportal.org ).
To further characterize Alk + neurons in the PVN, we employed single-cell RNA-sequencing (10x Genomics on 11,380 cells of ectodermal origin) in postnatal mice (P10–23). We used published criteria on hypothalamic neuronal heterogeneity ( Simmons and Swanson, 2009 89. Simmons, D.M. ∙ Swanson, L.W. Comparison of the spatial distribution of seven types of neuroendocrine neurons in the rat paraventricular nucleus: toward a global 3D model J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 516 :423-441 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to separate magnocellular neuroendocrine oxytocin (mneOXY), magnocellular neuroendocrine vasopressin (mneVAS), parvicellular neuroendocrine corticotropin-releasing hormone (pneCRH), parvicellular neuroendocrine somatostatin (pneSS), and parvicellular neuroendocrine thyrotropin-releasing hormone (pneTRH) neurons ( Figure 5 C; Figures S5 B and S5C). Out of the 514 neurons we were able to assign to PVN origin, 223 also expressed Alk . Further fine mapping showed that most Alk + cells are excitatory glutamatergic neurons based on their co-expression of Slc17a6 ( Vglut2 ; Figure 5 D, left panel). Alk + neurons were largely negative for Gad1 ( Figure 5 D, middle panel), a marker for inhibitory GABA neurons. Among the five subtypes of PVN neurons, Alk + neurons preferentially correspond to pneSS neurons ( Figure 5 D, right panel) and to a lesser extent to pneCRH neurons ( Figure S6 A). Among pneTRH, mneOXY, and mneVAS neurons, Alk can be expressed, but neither positive nor strong correlation was observed ( Figures S6 B–S6D). Using UpSet plots revealed co-expression of the neuropetides Gal > Adcyap1 > Bdnf and Cartpt in Alk + neurons. Moreover, many Alk + neurons contained mRNAs for growth hormone receptor ( Ghr ), μ opioid receptors ( Oprm1 ), opioid-related nociception receptor 1 ( Oprl1 ), and ciliary neurotrophic factors ( Cntfr ) ( Figure S6 E). Finally, we assessed differential gene expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers and known constituents of the ALK signaling pathway in the five defined neuronal populations of the PVN: in pneSS neurons, we find expression (defined as >25% of cells/cluster) of Slc17a6 ( Vglut2 ); Slc2a3 ( Glut3 ); Alk, Ptprz1 (regulator of ALK activity) ( Perez-Pinera et al., 2007 77.

Expression of Alk in excitatory Vglut2 + neurons was confirmed in an independent single-cell dataset from the hypothalamus (not shown).
Next, we searched to further annotate the thinness-associated ALK variants using public data from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) epigenomic web browser, as well as PhenoScanner and different brain eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) databases. Chromatin state annotation predicted that the region is within an enhancer site in adipocytes and neurospheres ( https://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/ ) ( Li et al., 2019 55. Li, D. ∙ Hsu, S. ∙ Purushotham, D. ... WashU Epigenome Browser update 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W158-W165 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). We cloned a 239 base pair fragment spanning the rs568057364 indel into a luciferase reporter vector ( Muerdter et al., 2018 71. Muerdter, F. ∙ Boryń, Ł.M. ∙ Woodfin, A.R. ... Resolving systematic errors in widely used enhancer activity assays in human cells Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :141-149 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) and introduced this reporter into SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which directly confirmed that this region has enhancer activity ( Figure S6 G). We also attempted to model both ALK indels in cell lines but the complexity (stretches of DNA with guanine/cytosine content >80%) and repetitiveness of the DNA sequence spanning the 2 ALK indels did not allow synthesis or targeting of the locus using CRISPR-Cas9. Therefore, we could not assess whether different variants affect enhancer activity. Taking advantage of the Human Brain Almanac, we investigated possible eQTL effects in 10 different brain regions. Owing to the modest sample size (n = 134 subjects), and in order to increase statistical power, we performed a set-based analyses of 11 SNPs (corresponding to SNPs with r-square >50% with our top variants). We found an eQTL effect with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10% for three brain tissues, namely the temporal cortex, putamen, and cerebellar cortex ( Table S4 ). Of note, we have no access to such data from the hypothalamus. Thus, in mouse and man, ALK is expressed in defined brain regions and the human variants appear to associate with altered expression.
Finally, to genetically map the tissue responsible for the observed action of Alk in thinness, we crossed our Alk -floxed mice to various tissue-specific Cre mouse lines. In line with our Alk expression data ( Figure S5 A), tissue-specific depletion of Alk in WAT ( AdipoqCre ) or BAT ( Ucp1Cre ), intestine ( VillinCre ), liver ( AlbuminCre ), muscle ( MckCre ), or hematopoietic cells ( Vav1-iCre ) did not affect HFD-induced obesity ( Figures S7 A–S7F). Of note, we could not analyze Alk fl/fl NestinCre mice, because our NestinCre line itself exhibits a strong metabolic phenotype, obscuring any conclusions (not shown). Because Alk is mainly expressed in the PVN, we therefore used stereotactic brain injections of adenovirus to target the PVN of Alk fl/fl mice and specifically deplete Alk expression. This approach also allowed us to exclude any potential developmental effects of Alk deletion. Control mice received an injection of the AAV::GFP viral vector ( Alk fl/fl GFP), whereas the experimental group was co-injected with AAV::DIO-GFP (Cre-dependent GFP) and AAV::Cre viral vectors ( Alk fl/fl GFP+CRE), leading to PVN-specific deletion of Alk ( Figure 5 E). Following surgery, the mice recovered for 2 weeks and were subsequently fed a HFD. Strikingly, Alk fl/fl GFP+CRE mice showed resistance to HFD-induced obesity and reduced feeding efficiency relative to Alk fl/fl GFP mice ( Figures 5 F and 5G). These data show that ALK acts in the central nervous system to control body weight and weight gain.
How does ALK in the PVN control fat metabolism? Plasma levels of PVN-regulated hormones corticosterone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and oxytocin appeared normal in Alk mutant mice ( Figures S7 G–S7I). The PVN has also been shown to regulate sympathetic outflow to WAT ( Bamshad et al., 1998; Foster et al., 2010 5. Bamshad, M. ∙ Aoki, V.T. ∙ Adkison, M.G. ... Central nervous system origins of the sympathetic nervous system outflow to white adipose tissue Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275 :R291-R299 PubMed Google Scholar 27.

Hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus lesion involvement in the sympathetic control of lipid mobilization Obesity (Silver Spring). 2010; 18 :682-689 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and BAT ( Bamshad et al., 1999; Oldfield et al., 2002; Sved et al., 2001 6. Bamshad, M. ∙ Song, C.K. ∙ Bartness, T.J. CNS origins of the sympathetic nervous system outflow to brown adipose tissue Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276 :R1569-R1578 PubMed Google Scholar 73.

Physiol. 2001; 28 :115-119 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, quantification of the sympathetic mediator norepinephrine (NE) in epWAT and scWAT revealed increased levels of NE in Alk -deficient mice compared to controls ( Figure 6 A), suggesting that Alk acts in the hypothalamus to control sympathetic tone to the fat tissue. We next asked whether increased sympathetic tone to the adipose tissue also exists in constitutionally thin humans. We took advantage of the availability of fat tissue samples from a previously described clinical study on 30 well-characterized constitutionally thin individuals ( Ling et al., 2019 56. Ling, Y. ∙ Carayol, J. ∙ Galusca, B. ... Persistent low body weight in humans is associated with higher mitochondrial activity in white adipose tissue Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2019; 110 :605-616 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Paralleling our findings in mice, we indeed found markedly increased NE levels in the WAT of constitutionally thin subjects compared to their age- and sex-matched controls ( Figure 6 B).
Because NE induces lipolysis in fat tissues ( Bartness et al., 2014 7. Bartness, T.J. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Shrestha, Y.B. ... Neural innervation of white adipose tissue and the control of lipolysis Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2014; 35 :473-493 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), we focused on lipid storage and metabolism. As with mice on SD, HFD-fed Alk +/+ and Alk −/− mice displayed normal levels of neutral sterols and bile acid content in the feces and plasma triglycerides ( Figures S8 A and S8B). Interestingly, despite reduced body adiposity, plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels were elevated in both male and female SD-fed Alk −/− mice ( Figures S8 C and S8D), our second Alk −/− mouse line Alk fl/fl ActinCre + ( Figure S8 E), and HFD-fed Alk −/− mice ( Figure S8 F) when compared to littermate controls. Moreover, adipose tissue NEFA levels were also increased in HFD-fed Alk −/− mice ( Figure 6 C), suggesting that Alk −/− mice exhibit increased adipose tissue lipolysis. To directly test this hypothesis, we measured phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) at serine 660, a critical step in the induction of lipolysis ( Holm, 2003 38. Holm, C. Molecular mechanisms regulating hormone-sensitive lipase and lipolysis Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31 :1120-1124 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, western blot analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of HSL in both epWAT and scWAT of fasted Alk −/− mice fed SDs as well as HFDs compared to controls ( Figures 6 D and 6E). In line with increased HSL phosphorylation, we observed marked upregulation of seven key genes involved in fatty acid oxidation ( Pgc1α , Pdk4 , Acox1 , Cpt1b , Acads , Acadl , and Acadm ) in the epWAT of Alk −/− mice compared to Alk +/+ mice fed SD ( Figure 6 F) as well as HFD ( Figure 6 G). We also observed enhanced NE levels and HSL-serine 660 phosphorylation in BAT of Alk −/− mice ( Figures S8 G and S8H). In addition, PVN-specific Alk depletion using stereotactic injections phenocopied the increased WAT lipolysis, as determined by HSL phosphorylation ( Figure 6 H).
NE has also been shown to induce browning of fat tissue ( Harms and Seale, 2013 36. Harms, M. ∙ Seale, P. Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1252-1263 Crossref Scopus (1152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas Ucp1 protein levels were apparently not changed in the BAT of Alk mutant mice ( Figure S8 H), we did observe increased levels of Ucp1 protein ( Figure 6 I) as well upregulation of thermogenic ( Elovl3 , Cidea , Dio2 ) and mitochondrial ( Pdk4 , Acadl , Acadm , Cox7a , and Cox8b ) gene expression ( Figure S8 I) in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, indicating browning of WAT. Of note, increased levels of plasma NEFA levels and lipolysis did not result in ectopic fat deposition because liver and muscle triglyceride levels were not changed in HFD-fed mice ( Figure S8 J). Moreover, levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, iNOS, and TNF-α) were not changed in the liver of HFD-fed Alk −/− mice ( Figure S8 K). Overall, our data show that ALK in the PVN acts as a negative regulator of WAT lipolysis and sympathetic tone to fine-tune energy homeostasis.

Section: Discussion

Our results identify genetic variants in ALK associated with thinness as well as other metabolic traits in human. As the genetic association of the ALK variants with thinness remained correlative, we further characterized the metabolic function of ALK in vivo . A role for ALK in thinness was confirmed in Drosophila and multiple genetic mouse models, establishing a critical role for ALK in the regulation of thinness throughout evolution.
Few studies have evaluated the genetics of thinness. This is partly due to the difficulty of identifying suitable large cohorts in which the true metabolically healthy thinness state can be refined. We took advantage of the wide age range of the unique Estonian biobank recruitment as well as its strong phenotypic datasets, making ECGUT an ideal starting point to identify potential variants and genes playing a role in thinness. Of note, the Estonian population has been shown to be comparable to other European populations, in contrast to specific isolated populations such as Finns or Icelanders ( Khrunin et al., 2013; Saag et al., 2019 47. Khrunin, A.V. ∙ Khokhrin, D.V. ∙ Filippova, I.N. ... A genome-wide analysis of populations from European Russia reveals a new pole of genetic diversity in northern Europe PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e58552 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 84.

Biol. 2019; 29 :1701-1711.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the Estonian biobank, we identified multiple novel variants associated with thinness. These variants were further prioritized using fly genetic studies. This assumes that the allele with preliminary evidence for association with thinness in humans is the one that leads to either decreased expression or function of its target gene. In the case that the thinness allele would lead to increased expression or a gain of function with respect to the reference allele, the RNAi screen would miss those candidates. From the genes that showed an association with triglyceride levels in our fly screening assays, only for the ALK gene, the BMI-associated variants were located within the body of the gene. Importantly, in addition to the top ALK variants from the EGCUT cohort (indels rs568057364 and rs202021741), mining of GWAS data uncovered a further four downstream variants (rs12990552, rs10495771, rs55737023, and rs7578465) within the ALK locus that are associated with BMI in the GIANT ( Fox et al., 2007; Locke et al., 2015 28.

Yengo, L. ∙ Sidorenko, J. ∙ Kemper, K.E. ..., GIANT Consortium Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for height and body mass index in :700000 individuals of European ancestry Hum. Mol. Genet. 2018; 27 :3641-3649 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/ ) datasets. Conditional analyses with these four variants showed no impact on the association of the two ALK indels identified in our EGCUT GWAS with the thinness phenotype (rs568057364 p = 1.52E-06 and rs202021741 p = 4.71E-06), thereby demonstrating the independence of our ALK indels and the BMI-associated ALK variants. Moreover, other variants within the ALK gene are associated with other metabolic traits, including adiponectin levels, glucose- and lipid homeostasis ( Kathiresan et al., 2009; Lettre et al., 2011; Li et al., 2015; Meigs et al., 2007; Palmer et al., 2015 46.

Genetic variants associated with quantitative glucose homeostasis traits translate to type 2 diabetes in Mexican Americans: The GUARDIAN (Genetics underlying diabetes in Hispanics) consortium Diabetes. 2015; 64 :1853-1866 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, our ECGUT results and mining of GWAS data showed that several variants within the ALK locus are associated with metabolic traits such as lipid and glucose homeostasis, BMI, and, importantly, thinness.
In an attempt to replicate our human GWAS findings, we explored different cohorts. Importantly, our top two ALK variants are imputed indels and thus might not be systematically present in all cohorts (e.g., in GIANT studies). Moreover, they are located in a recombination hotspot and in low LD with other variants, making its detection challenging. In addition, the selection criteria for the UK Biobank (UKBB) ( Sudlow et al., 2015 94. Sudlow, C. ∙ Gallacher, J. ∙ Allen, N. ... UK biobank: an open access resource for identifying the causes of a wide range of complex diseases of middle and old age PLoS Med. 2015; 12 :e1001779 Crossref Scopus (1281) PubMed Google Scholar ) and STILTS (Study Into Lean and Thin Subjects) cohorts ( Riveros-McKay et al., 2019 82. Riveros-McKay, F. ∙ Mistry, V. ∙ Bounds, R. ..., Understanding Society Scientific Group Genetic architecture of human thinness compared to severe obesity PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1007603 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) are different from the EGCUT cohort. First, the UKBB only includes individuals in the age range from 37 to 69, which is substantially older than the population selected in our study (20 to 44 years old). By selecting only the overlapping age categories (up to 45 years old) and using a similar BMI percentile approach as for the EGCUT analysis, the thinness-associating ALK variants identified in the EGCUT cohort were tested but did not associate with thinness in the UKBB. Second, the recent thinness study using the STILTS database ( Riveros-McKay et al., 2019 82. Riveros-McKay, F. ∙ Mistry, V. ∙ Bounds, R. ..., Understanding Society Scientific Group Genetic architecture of human thinness compared to severe obesity PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1007603 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) identified persistently thin healthy individuals using a fixed BMI cutoff of less than 19, independent of age and gender. Moreover, less stringent selection criteria were used for the control group from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), whose BMI ranged from normal to obese (mean BMI 27 kg/m 2 +/− 8 SD), differed significantly in gender proportion (82% thin versus 55% control women, Fisher’s exact test p < 0.001) and were significantly older than the thin subjects (52 versus 37 years old, t test p < 0.001). The UKBB is one of the largest and most commonly used prospective cohorts, yet, relative to the EGCUT cohort, targeted toward older age, where BMI associations become more variable. Indeed, using the full EGCUT cohort, we found a strong non-linear association between BMI and age (p value < 2e-16). When repeating such association analysis in subjects in the 20- to 45-year age category only, this complex relationship was still observed (p value = 0.016), yet it was significantly smaller (20-fold factor). Even though we did not observe a significant interaction between age and genotype effect (p values > 0.1 for both ALK indels) in our study, body composition changes are known to occur frequently in healthy people from the ages of 45–50 onward related to hormonal changes (such as menopause) and decreased physical activity ( Davis et al., 2012; Guo et al., 1999 17. Davis, S.R. ∙ Castelo-Branco, C. ∙ Chedraui, P. ..., Writing Group of the International Menopause Society for World Menopause Day 2012 Understanding weight gain at menopause Climacteric. 2012; 15 :419-429 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Guo, S.S. ∙ Zeller, C. ∙ Chumlea, W.C. ... Aging, body composition, and lifestyle: the Fels Longitudinal Study Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 70 :405-411 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study is not empowered to evaluate a hormonal interaction with the genetic makeup in subjects above 46 years, but we used this upper age limit to exclude another factor of variability. We conclude that the different age distribution in the UKBB might be one factor contributing to the lack of replication.
The consequence of the intronic ALK variants associated with thinness requires further investigation. Our data suggest that the top ALK variants might be located in a regulatory region. Indeed, experimental enhancer assays in a human neuroblastoma cell line support the notion that at least the region around rs568057364 has enhancer activity. Moreover, eQTL analysis using the Brain Almanac data showed evidence for the ALK variants to affect ALK expression in specific brain regions, such as the cerebellar cortex, putamen, and temporal cortex: brain regions in which ALK expression was among the highest. Yet at this stage we cannot pinpoint any direct causal effect of the variants on ALK expression in humans because this would require access to both hypothalamus-specific gene expression data and also large sample size to perform reliable Mendelian randomization analyses ( Burgess, 2014; Davies et al., 2018 11. Burgess, S. Sample size and power calculations in Mendelian randomization with a single instrumental variable and a binary outcome Int. J. Epidemiol. 2014; 43 :922-929 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar 16. Davies, N.M. ∙ Holmes, M.V. ∙ Davey Smith, G. Reading Mendelian randomisation studies: a guide, glossary, and checklist for clinicians BMJ. 2018; 362 :k601 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). A direct link between the ALK variants and human thinness is therefore preliminary and requires additional validation in other cohorts and follow-up studies.
Nonetheless, although all these data are supporting the notion of ALK being involved in metabolism in human, the caveats of GWAS have been demonstrated in case of the most prominent obesity associated gene, FTO . Although several studies showed that intronic variants of the FTO gene robustly associate with human obesity ( Dina et al., 2007; Frayling et al., 2007; Scuteri et al., 2007 20. Dina, C. ∙ Meyre, D. ∙ Gallina, S. ... Variation in FTO contributes to childhood obesity and severe adult obesity Nat. Genet. 2007; 39 :724-726 Crossref Scopus (1073) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Frayling, T.M. ∙ Timpson, N.J. ∙ Weedon, M.N. ... A common variant in the FTO gene is associated with body mass index and predisposes to childhood and adult obesity Science. 2007; 316 :889-894 Crossref Scopus (2835) PubMed Google Scholar 87. Scuteri, A. ∙ Sanna, S. ∙ Chen, W.M. ... Genome-wide association scan shows genetic variants in the FTO gene are associated with obesity-related traits PLoS Genet. 2007; 3 :e115 Crossref Scopus (1133) PubMed Google Scholar ), follow-up studies revealed that two neighboring genes, IRX3 and RPGRIP1L , rather than FTO activity itself, are responsible for the observed body weight effects ( Tung et al., 2014 97. Tung, Y.C.L. ∙ Yeo, G.S.H. ∙ O’Rahilly, S. ... Obesity and FTO: Changing focus at a complex locus Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :710-718 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it was paramount to directly demonstrate that ALK is indeed involved in weight regulation and glucose homeostasis. Our mouse knockouts of Alk , using two distinct and independently generated mutant lines, results in thin mice at normal diet, HFD, and under conditions of leptin deficiency. These genetic data provide direct proof that ALK has a role in weight regulation, with striking similarities to the human thinness phenotype.
Our data in Drosophila show that Alk downregulations using RNAi results in reduced triglyceride levels. Moreover, we previously identified Alk as a hit for “skinny” Drosophila in our genome-wide screen for obesity ( Pospisilik et al., 2010 78. Pospisilik, J.A. ∙ Schramek, D. ∙ Schnidar, H. ... Drosophila genome-wide obesity screen reveals hedgehog as a determinant of brown versus white adipose cell fate Cell. 2010; 140 :148-160 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ) and another fly study identified Alk as a cell-intrinsic regulator of organ sparing (neuroblasts) under conditions of nutrient restriction ( Cheng et al., 2011 13. Cheng, L.Y. ∙ Bailey, A.P. ∙ Leevers, S.J. ... Anaplastic lymphoma kinase spares organ growth during nutrient restriction in Drosophila Cell. 2011; 146 :435-447 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because our mechanistic mouse data now show that ALK slows lipolysis and maintains adipose storage, anabolic and catabolic lipid flux and excess fat storage might be evolutionary conserved to ensure protection from cold and regulate nutrient availability.
Unlike patients with anorexia nervosa, a disease tightly linked to psychiatric phenotypes ( Duncan et al., 2017 21. Duncan, L. ∙ Yilmaz, Z. ∙ Gaspar, H. ..., Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Significant Locus and Metabolic Genetic Correlations Revealed in Genome-Wide Association Study of Anorexia Nervosa Am. J. Psychiatry. 2017; 174 :850-858 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ), metabolically healthy thin individuals often have the desire to gain weight and have normal food intake and frequently snack, indicating they have a metabolic rather than hedonic low body weight. The metabolic body weight set point has a genetic basis, programmed by the energy balance circuitry in the hypothalamus and other specific brain regions ( Yu et al., 2015 108. Yu, Y.H. ∙ Vasselli, J.R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Metabolic vs. hedonic obesity: a conceptual distinction and its clinical implications Obes. Rev. 2015; 16 :234-247 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent clinical study led by some of the authors of our study showed that thin individuals (with BMI lower than 18.5 kg/m 2 ) have a distinct adipose-specific molecular signature, with smaller adipocytes, increased adipose mitochondrial activity, and concomitant augmented fatty acid oxidation, similar to the phenotypes of Alk mutant mice. Furthermore, plasma proteomic analyses demonstrated significantly higher plasma levels of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in thin individuals (23% higher), which was speculated to be an indicator for an increased sympathetic neuro-adipose axis in thin subjects ( Ling et al., 2019 56. Ling, Y. ∙ Carayol, J. ∙ Galusca, B. ... Persistent low body weight in humans is associated with higher mitochondrial activity in white adipose tissue Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2019; 110 :605-616 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, we now report enhanced levels of NE in the adipose tissue of constitutively thin humans. In addition, we found increased NE levels in the white as well as brown fat of Alk mutant mice, providing genetic evidence that Alk deficiency is associated with an altered sympathetic tone to the adipose organ. In line with enhanced sympathetic activation, we found molecular evidence for increased lipolysis as well as browning of the fat tissue, ultimately resulting in reduced feeding efficiency and enhanced EE independent of circadian activity, which mechanistically explains why Alk mutant mice remain thin.
Expression analysis revealed high Alk mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, especially in the PVN, which is also true for humans. Single-cell RNA sequencing in mouse showed that Alk is primarily expressed in the pneSS population within the PVN, in excitatory neurons in particular. Importantly our functional knockout data show that Alk expression in the PVN is indeed the critical site for the observed resistance to weight gain under HFD. The PVN receives inputs from several hypothalamic nuclei including the arcuate nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus and regulates energy homeostasis via hormonal pathways and the sympathetic nervous system ( Hill, 2012 37. Hill, J.W. PVN pathways controlling energy homeostasis Indian J. Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 16 :S627-S636 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, our single-cell profiling also showed that Alk -expressing neurons in the PVN overlap with Lmo4 expression. LMO4 (LIM domain only 4) was reported to repress Alk transcription ( Lasek et al., 2011b 50. Lasek, A.W. ∙ Gesch, J. ∙ Giorgetti, F. ... Alk is a transcriptional target of LMO4 and ERα that promotes cocaine sensitization and reward J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :14134-14141 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ablation of LMO4 in mouse excitatory glutamatergic neurons, including neurons of the PVN, results in obesity, reduced energy expenditure, and reduced sympathetic outflow to adipose tissue ( Zhou et al., 2012 110. Zhou, X. ∙ Gomez-Smith, M. ∙ Qin, Z. ... Ablation of LMO4 in glutamatergic neurons impairs leptin control of fat metabolism Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69 :819-828 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), further strengthening the notion that Alk is part of a brain circuit that controls feeding efficiency and EE. How ALK-expressing neurons shape metabolic control and how loss of ALK activity can ultimately overcome an obesogenic environment needs further investigation.
Leptin mediates its lipolytic effect through the action of sympathetic nerve fibers that innervate the adipose tissue ( Zeng et al., 2015 109. Zeng, W. ∙ Pirzgalska, R.M. ∙ Pereira, M.M.A. ... Sympathetic neuro-adipose connections mediate leptin-driven lipolysis Cell. 2015; 163 :84-94 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data that inactivation of Alk results in increased sympathetic tone to adipose tissue and markedly reduces obesity in leptin mutant mice also suggest a crosstalk to other key neuronal paths that control body mass ( Yi et al., 2013 107. Yi, C.X. ∙ Meyer, C.W. ∙ Jastroch, M. Leptin action in the brain: How (and when) it makes fat burn Mol. Metab. 2013; 2 :63-64 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, ALK pathway inhibition might promote thinness even in leptin resistance and other conditions of general and morbid obesity ( Sáinz et al., 2015 85.

ALK has gained prominence in cancer as a key oncogenic driver and as a drug target in multiple tumors. However, although ALK is a member of the insulin-receptor superfamily ( Morris et al., 1994 69. Morris, S.W. ∙ Kirstein, M.N. ∙ Valentine, M.B. ... Fusion of a kinase gene, ALK, to a nucleolar protein gene, NPM, in non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma Science. 1994; 263 :1281-1284 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), its physiological function was largely unknown. Our human GWAS data along with genetic and functional studies in flies and mice place ALK as a key central nervous system regulator of EE and identify ALK as a candidate gene for thinness.

Single-cell RNA-seq were deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number: GSE132730 ).
Individuals were selected from the EGCUT (Estonian Genomic Center of the University of Tartu) cohort ( https://genomics.ut.ee/en ). At the time of analysis, this population-based biobank contained clinical data and biological samples from 47102 individuals. All participants provided informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committees (Switzerland, protocol number 279/14).
Fly stocks were maintained on standard diet with agar, sugar and yeast and were raised in 25°C incubator at a 12/12 dark and night cycle. Actin-Gal4 was from Bloomington. RNAi fly lines were from the VDRC (Vienna Drosophila Resource Center).
Experimental animals were housed in SMI type2 long standard filtertop or individually ventilated cages, fed ad libitum and checked daily by veterinary staff. Unless stated otherwise, only male littermate mice group-housed at room temperature (∼23°C) were used for all experiments described and randomly assigned to experimental groups. All animal experiments were approved by the Austrian Animal Care and Use Committee.
The thinness phenotype was defined as those people with the lowest 6 th percentile BMI in the cohort adjusted for age and sex. Age ranged from 20 to 44 years old. Strict exclusion criteria based on ICD10 codes ( Table S1 ) were applied, including pregnancy, breastfeeding, postmenopausal or menstrual abnormalities, subjects with eating disorders according to DSMIV, severe chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes), professional athletes, depression or psychiatric condition (anti-depressant treatment), past surgery known to influence the endocrine system and/or weight (especially bariatric surgery), subjects under known treatment with beta-blockers, anti-hypertensives, lipid lowering drugs or corticoids for a long duration, as well as cancer patients. Control individuals were selected based on age-adjusted BMI in the 30-50 th percentile, while obese individuals had a BMI in the highest 95 th percentile of the population-wide BMI range ( Figure S1 ). Using these criteria, 881 putative thinness individuals were identified (one third male and two third females), as well as 3173 age- and sex-matched controls, and 555 age- and sex-matched obese individuals.
Genotype data were generated using HumanCorePsy array (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Genotypes were called with the GenomeStudio Software (Illumina). Rare variant genotype calling was performed using zCall ( Goldstein et al., 2012 31. Goldstein, J.I. ∙ Crenshaw, A. ∙ Carey, J. ..., Swedish Schizophrenia Consortium, ARRA Autism Sequencing Consortium zCall: a rare variant caller for array-based genotyping: genetics and population analysis Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :2543-2545 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genotype quality control removed any subject with SNP call rate lower than 98%, any gender discrepancies between known gender and inferred gender from genotype data, genotype heterozygosity > 3 standard deviations, population outlier (as detected with MDS analyses). Quality control also excluded any marker if the call rate was lower than 95%, it deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 1e-4), was a rare variant with Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) lower than 1%, and A/T or C/G genotypes (prior imputation). Genotype imputation was performed using SHAPEIT ( Delaneau et al., 2011 18. Delaneau, O. ∙ Marchini, J. ∙ Zagury, J.F. A linear complexity phasing method for thousands of genomes Nat. Methods. 2011; 9 :179-181 Crossref Scopus (845) PubMed Google Scholar ) and IMPUTE2 ( Howie et al., 2009 40. Howie, B.N. ∙ Donnelly, P. ∙ Marchini, J. A flexible and accurate genotype imputation method for the next generation of genome-wide association studies PLoS Genet. 2009; 5 :e1000529 Crossref Scopus (2291) PubMed Google Scholar ) based reference panels from the 1000 Genomes project ( Abecasis et al., 2012 2. Abecasis, G.R. ∙ Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes Nature. 2012; 491 :56-65 Crossref Scopus (4839) PubMed Google Scholar ) (1000 Genomes integrated haplotypes, Dec 2013 release). Post-imputation quality control removed markers with INFO score < 0.8 or MAF < 1%. In total, the genotype data consisted of 281K genotyped and 8.3M imputed markers.
10 virgin Actin-Gal4/CyO virgin females were crossed with 5-7 young UAS-RNAi or control w1118 males to drive RNAi-mediated whole-body knockdown of target genes. Once the F1 flies hatched, males were selected and at the age of 4-7 days put onto normal diet (10% sucrose, 10% yeast) or high sucrose diet (47.5% sucrose, 10% yeast) for 10 days. Body weight was measured using an analytic balance. For triglyceride measurements, 10 male flies were weighted and homogenized in 200 μL PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) on ice and sonicated. After sonication, 800 μL ice-cold PBST was added and mixed thoroughly. 50 μL of the mixture was used to determine the triglycerides using the Roche triglycerides kit (11730711216) under the manufacturer’s instructions. Triglyceride levels were normalized to body weight. The values were converted to a Z-score based on the following formula: ((Mean of Individual-Mean of Controls)/SD of control) and the cut off was at a 95% confidence interval on a 2-tailed test, which corresponded to a Z score of ≥ 1.96 or ≤ −1.96. Any target gene considered as a hit was confirmed by three independent screens for confirmation.
Food intake was measured by CAFE assay, which was modified from a previous study ( Ja et al., 2007 44. Ja, W.W. ∙ Carvalho, G.B. ∙ Mak, E.M. ... Prandiology of Drosophila and the CAFE assay Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2007; 104 :8253-8256 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5 male flies (4 days old) were put into each vial with wet paper at bottom and empty vials were used for evaporation controls. Liquid food of 5% yeast extract and 10% sucrose were loaded into 5 μl capillary and put into each vial for food intake assay. All food intake experiments were set up at Zeitgeber time 6–8, and food intake was recorded exactly 24 h after start of food loading.
For assessment of fly lifespan, 45 male flies were collected per genotype and the number of dead flies was counted every 2-3 days when flies were transferred to new medium.
Mice were housed on a 14/10 h light/dark cycle (except for indirect calorimetry and thermoneutrality, where mice were on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle). Standard chow diet was purchased from SSNIFF (V 1184-300; 10mm pellets autoclavable; 49% kcal carbohydrates, 36% kcal protein and 15% kcal fat) and high fat diet from ResearchDiets (D12492i; 20% kcal carbohydrates, 20% kcal protein and 60% kcal fat). Alk conventional knockout mice, containing a LacZ cassette, were purchased from Deltagen ( www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:5700373 ) ; Mdk and Ptn knockout mice were both purchased from Riken BRC ( https://www.brc.riken.jp/ ); Alk flox/flox conditional knockout mice were derived in-house from targeted ES cells generated by the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program ( www.eucomm.org ); Ucp1 Cre mice were kindly provided by Dr. Jan-Wilhelm Kornfeld (Jens Bruening Lab); β-Actin Cre mice were kindly provided by Dr. Andreas Leibbrandt (originally Nasmyth group – IMP) and Villin Cre mice originate from Institut Curie (Sylvie Robine Lab). The following mouse lines were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory ( https://www.jax.org/ ): β-Actin Cre (FVB/N- Tmem163 Tg(ACTB-cre)2Mrt /J); Adipoq Cre (B6;FVB-Tg(Adipoq-cre)1Evdr/J); Alb Cre (B6.Cg-Speer6-ps1Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J); Mck Cre (B6.FVB(129S4)-Tg(Ckmm-cre)5Khn/J); Vav1-i Cre (B6.Cg-Commd10Tg(Vav1-icre)A2Kio/J) and Lep knockout mice (B6.Cg-Lepob/J).
An autosomal genome scan was performed by means of a low-density panel of 88 DNA-microsatellite markers (short tandem repeats, STRs) which show isogenic strain-specific allele fragment lengths ( Wakeland et al., 1997 101. Wakeland, E. ∙ Morel, L. ∙ Achey, K. ... Speed congenics: a classic technique in the fast lane (relatively speaking) Immunol. Today. 1997; 18 :472-477 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Map locations and primer sequences of the microsatellite loci were used according to the Mouse Locus List ( http://www.informatics.jax.org ). The PCR-based scan was applied to 40 backcrossed mice; the animals showing the highest percentage of recipient strain genome and the smallest size of the donor strain element co-segregating with the site of interest were used for further backcrossing.
In difference to all other experiments, where Alk knockout mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 using speed congenics, animals used for global phenotypic and behavioral analysis as well as histopathology were still on a mixed genetic background of C57BL/6 and 129.
Behavioral tests. All behavioral tests were performed on the same group of adult males 10-12 weeks (n ≥ 7). Mice were run through the behavioral programs in the following order: open field test, tail flick test, rotarod test and hot plate test. Females were not studied due to variability caused by the estrous cycle. Males were group-housed, with no access to females post-weaning. Wild-type and homozygous mutant mice were not segregated by cage. Mice were allowed to habituate to the behavior room environment for 30 min prior to experimentation unless otherwise indicated. Chambers were sanitized with a 0.25% bleach solution before each test and between animals. The experimenters changed gloves before handling mice from different cages.
Mice were screened for behavioral abnormalities by evaluating the response to a novel environment using an open field test (ENV-515; constructed with opaque PVC, 43.2 × 43.2 × 30.5 cm; https://www.med-associates.com ). Movement of animals was monitored by an array of 16 infrared detectors. The computer controller allowed the operation of 8 independent chambers simultaneously. Each animal was placed gently in the center of its assigned chamber. Tests were for 10 min, with the experimenter out of the animals’ sight. Activity of individual mice was recorded for the 10-min test session and monitored by photobeam breaks in the x-, y- and z axes. Measurements taken include total distance traveled, percent of session time spent in the central region of the test apparatus and average velocity during the ambulatory episodes.
For the tail flick test, a high intensity light beam was directed at the restrained tail of the mouse through a small hole and latency to the tail flick was detected automatically. Inter-trial intervals lasted at least 60 s.
The Accelerating Rotarod (AccuScan Instruments, Inc.; Columbus, OH 43228) was used to screen for motor coordination, balance and ataxia phenotypes. The unit consists of an analyzer with 4 ports to connect up to 4 test chambers. Each test chamber is individually controlled. The analyzer is connected to a computer’s serial COM port and interfaced via Windows 3.1 software. Light beams are used for sensing an animal’s fall. Each test chamber records the time when the animal falls off the rotating rod (70 mm in diameter), and the speed of rod at the time of fall. Test chambers are fully enclosed, so the animals are not able to jump out or see neighboring subjects. Mice were allowed to move about on their wire-cage top for 30 s prior to testing to ensure awareness. Mice were placed on the stationary rod, facing away from the experimenter. The “speed profile” programs the rotarod to reach 60 rpm after six minutes. Most mice fell from the rotarod between 30 and 90 s after the test is begun. A photobeam is broken when the animal falls, which stops the test clock for that chamber. The animals were tested over three trials with a 20-min rest period between trials.
For the hot plate assay, wild-type and mutant litter-mate mice were tested for hot plate latency at 50°C and 55°C (UGO Basile, Model 35100). Mice were placed gently on the surface and the time from then until response was noted. Responses include licking of either hind paw or jumping.
Physical exam. Male and female mice (age bin: 49 and 300 days) were first observed in their home cages for a number of general characteristics such as activity level, behavior toward siblings, posture, grooming, breathing pattern and sounds, and movement. General body condition and size were noted as well. Following a visual inspection of the mouse in the cage, the mouse was handled for a detailed, stepwise examination. The head was examined first, including eyes, ears, and nose, noting any discharge, malformations, or other abnormalities. Lymph nodes and glands of the head and neck were palpated. Skin, hair coat, axial and appendicular skeleton, and abdomen were also assessed. The limbs and torso were palpated for masses, malformations or other abnormalities. The anogenital region was examined for discharges, staining of hair, or other changes. If the mouse defecated during the examination, the feces were assessed for color and consistency.
Fertility . The reproductive traits of male (67-159 days old) and female Alk mutant mice were tested to identify potential defects in spermatogenesis, oogenesis, maternal ability to support pre- or post-embryonic development, or mammary gland defects and ability of the female knockout mice to nurse their pups. Three homozygous mutant mice of each gender were set up in a fertility mating with a homozygous mutant mouse of the opposite gender at seven to eight weeks of age. The numbers of pups born from one to three litters were recorded at birth. Three weeks later, the live pups were counted and weaned.
Necropsy . The necropsy, or post-mortem examination, was performed following deep general anesthesia, cardiac puncture for terminal blood collection, and euthanasia. The necropsy, which was done in a stepwise fashion, included detailed examination of the whole mouse, the skinned carcass, skeleton, and all major organ systems. Significant lesions and abnormal findings in organs and tissues were noted during the examination. When an organ appeared normal, the term “NSA” or “No Significant Abnormalities” was chosen. Terms such as mass, exudate, discoloration, and others were chosen as appropriate to describe changes in organs. Organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and submitted to the histopathology laboratory for processing. Male and female mice (age bin: 49 and 300 days) were examined for the following observables: adrenal glands, bone marrow, bone - cranium, bone - femur, bone - sternum, bone - stifle joint, bone - vertebral column, brain, cecum, colon, duodenum, epididymis - seminal vesicle, esophagus, eyes, gallbladder, general appearance, harderian glands, heart, ileum, jejunum, kidneys, liver, lungs, lymph nodes, mesentery, ovaries, pancreas, penis, salivary glands, sciatic nerve, scrotum, skeletal muscle, skin, skinned mouse, spleen, stomach, testes, thymus, tongue, trachea, urinary bladder, urine, uterus, and vagina.
Histopathology . The following tissues of male and female mice (age bin: 49 and 300 days) were examined: white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, brain, pituitary gland, ears, nasal cavity, salivary glands, oral cavity, lymph nodes, aorta, lungs, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, stomach, small and large intestines, larynx, esophagus, trachea, thyroid gland, thymus gland, tongue, skeletal muscle, sciatic nerve, mammary glands, vertebrae, spinal cord, bone (skull, sternum, femur, tibia, and stifle joint), reproductive tract (including gonads), eyes, harderian glands, integumentary system (skin and either clitoral or preputial glands), and bone marrow (examined in sections of sternum, vertebrae, and/or femur and tibia).
Hematology. Blood samples of male and female mice (age bin: 49, 90, 180 and 300 days) were collected via a terminal cardiac puncture in a syringe. One hundred microliters of each whole blood sample were transferred into tubes pre-filled with EDTA. Approximately 25uL of the blood were placed onto a glass slide to prepare a peripheral blood smear. The blood smears were later stained with Wright’s Stain that differentially stains white blood cell nuclei, granules and cytoplasm, and allows the identification of different cell types. The slides were analyzed microscopically by counting and noting each cell type in a total of 100 white blood cells. The percentage of each of the cell types counted was then calculated. Red blood cell morphology was also evaluated. Furthermore, whole blood was analyzed using a Cell-Dyn 3700 Hematology Analyzer. The following parameters were measured: white blood cells, red blood cells, red blood cell morphology, haemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils.
Serum Chemistry . The following analytes were measured in male and female mice (age bin: 49, 90, 180 and 300 days): electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate); renal function (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, osmolality), inorganic ions (calcium, phosphorus), liver function (alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin); cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, triglycerides, glucose and creatine kinase.
Evaluation of lean and fat mass was performed by using a 15.2 T MRI horizontal bore scanner and BFG6S-100 actively shielded gradient system (1 T/m maximum gradient strength (Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). A 35 mm quadrature birdcage coil was used for both transmission and reception. All animals (SD: 6 months old; HFD: 5 months old and 1 month on HFD) were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction and 1.5% maintenance). Imaging was done using multi-slice spin echo sequence (TR/TE 800/4.01 ms, NAX = 2, 0.137 X 0.137 mm 2 , 0.5 mm slice thickness, 2 averages). During imaging, respiration was monitored using small animal monitoring system (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY), and the body temperature was maintained using circulating water bath (Thermo Scientific). The lean and fat volume was calculated based on semi-automated segmentation of 2D images multiplied by slice thickness using AMIRA (V 6.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Adipocyte size analyses was performed using H&E stained paraffin sections of epididymal and subcutaneous WAT pads (SD: 18 weeks old; HFD: 6 months old and 16 weeks on HFD). 50 adipocytes per fat pad section and four sections per mouse were analyzed by semi-automated morphometry (AxioVision morphometry software, Zeiss).
Prior to recording of food intake, mice were single housed and let to acclimatize to new housing conditions for 2 weeks. Food intake and body weight gain of standard chow (2-5 months old) and high fat diet (3-9 months old and 1-16 weeks on HFD) fed animals were measured over several weeks. Feeding efficiency (1 st month on HFD) was calculated as mg body weight gain per kcal food consumed. Data was excluded if food was spilled in the cage.
To study intestinal absorption of dietary fat, mice (3-4 months old) were challenged with a bolus of 100 μL of olive oil containing 2 μCi 3H-triolein (Perkin Elmer) through intragastric gavage. To inhibit the clearance of plasma triacylglycerol, we administered i.p. 100 μL of the surfactant tyloxapol (5% in PBS, Sigma-Aldrich) 15 min before intragastric gavage. Blood was collected before (time 0) and at 1 h, 2 h and 4 h after intragastric gavage for scintillation counting (Ultima Gold solution measured using the Tri-Carb 4910TR liquid scintillation counter; Perkin Elmer).
The following kits were used to measure plasma TG, NEFA, corticosterone, TSH, oxytocin and adiponectin levels (SD: 4 months old; HFD: 6 months old and 16 weeks on HFD): Dialab triglycerides, GPO-PAP (D00390); WAKO (HR Series NEFA-HR(2)); Enzo Life Sciences corticosterone ELISA kit (ADI-900-097); EIAAB mouse thyrotropin subunit beta ELISA (E0463m); Enzo Life Sciences oxytocin ELISA kit (ADI-900-153A) and Quantikine mouse adiponectin/Acrp30 Immunoassay (MRP300).
Tissue triglyceride measurements . Tissue lipid extraction was performed using a slightly modified Folch method ( Folch et al., 1957 26. Folch, J. ∙ Lees, M. ∙ Sloane Stanley, G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226 :497-509 Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, approximately 50mg (±10mg) of snap frozen tissues (mice were 5 months old and 1 month on HFD) were homogenized using the “Precellys Evolution” bead homogenizer in 250μl ice-cold PBS, and subsequently mixed by vortexing with 750μl of a chloroform/methanol (2:1) solution, followed by a centrifugation step (21,000 g for 10 min at 4°C). The organic phase of the samples was transferred to a fresh glass tube. The organic solvents were vaporized under a nitrogen flow, and the resulting pellet resuspended in 250μl of chloroform (2% Triton-X v/v). After an additional vaporizing step at 50°C, we resolubilized the pellets in 100μl aqua bidest. TG abundance was measured using the widely employed GOP/PAP method, where glycerol is enzymatically cleaved from the acyl side chains and in further enzymatic reactions, a colorimetric shift is produced, corresponding to the concentration of the TG content (Roche Diagnostics).
Tissue NEFA measurements. For tissue extraction of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), we used the recommended protocol of the Abcam free fatty acid kit (ab65341) ( Becares et al., 2019; Scopelliti et al., 2019 8. Becares, N. ∙ Gage, M.C. ∙ Voisin, M. ... Impaired LXRα Phosphorylation Attenuates Progression of Fatty Liver Disease Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :984-995.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 86. Scopelliti, A. ∙ Bauer, C. ∙ Yu, Y. ... A Neuronal Relay Mediates a Nutrient Responsive Gut/Fat Body Axis Regulating Energy Homeostasis in Adult Drosophila Cell Metab. 2019; 29 :269-284.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). A chloroform solution containing 1%Triton-X (v/v) was employed for lysing snap frozen tissue samples (mice were 5 months old and 1 month on HFD). The average weight of the utilized tissue was 20mg (±5mg). After cutting and weighing, the samples were lysed using the “Precellys Evolution” homogenizer until the lysate was homogeneous. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000 g at 4°C, and consequently the organic phase was transferred to a fresh glass tube. We removed the organic phase by air-drying at 50°C in a fume hood. The pellet was resolubilized in the Abcam assay buffer and quantified using the Abcam free fatty acid kit.
Mice (SD: 3-4 months old; HFD: 5 months old and 3 months on HFD) were fasted overnight and administered an oral glucose bolus by gavage (2g/kg for standard chow fed mice and 1g/kg for high fat diet fed mice). Blood glucose concentrations were measured every 15 min over a time range of one h using a handheld blood glucose meter (One Touch UltraEasy; Lifescan). For analysis of insulin levels, tail vein blood samples were added to a NaCl/EDTA solution to avoid blood clotting and plasma insulin concentrations were determined using the Alpco Mouse Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA (80-INSMSU-E10).
At the age of 8 weeks, male Alk +/+ and Alk −/− mice were single housed in SMI type2 long standard filtertop cages and transferred to a climate chamber (Memmert, HPP 750) set to 30°C and 12/12 h light/dark cycle. Animals were fed ad libitum , checked daily by veterinary staff and body weight was recorded once a week.
Fecal samples collected from individually housed mice over a 24 h (SD fed mice; 4 months old) or 48 h (HFD fed mice; 5 months old and 3 months on HFD) period were dried, weighed and thoroughly grounded. An internal standard (49 nmol of 5α-cholestane) was added to 50mg of feces followed by the addition of 250μl 1M sodium hydroxide and 750μl methanol. Samples were heated to 80°C and then extracted 3 times with petroleum ether 60-80, each time collecting the ether fractions, which were subsequently evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. After adding a mixture of BSTFA, pyridine and TMCS (5:5:0.1) followed by evaporation again under a stream of nitrogen, heptane was added to the samples and they were analyzed for neutral sterols by gas liquid chromatography (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The water layer from the extraction was transferred to Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, flushed out with 75% methanol and then the eluate was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. 200μl of methanol and acetyl chloride (1:20) were added to the tubes, the mixture was heated to 55°C and then dried again under a stream of nitrogen. Derivatization was performed exactly as for neutral sterols and samples were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography.
All measurements were performed at room temperature (21°C-23°C) on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle in a PhenoMaster System (TSE systems, Bad Homburg, Germany) using an open circuit calorimetry system and animals were checked daily by veterinary staff. Mice (4-7 months old; 2-14 weeks on HFD) were housed individually, trained on drinking nozzles for 72 h and allowed to adapt to the PhenoMaster chamber for 2 days. Food and water were provided ad libitum in the appropriate devices and measured by the build-in automated instruments. Parameters of indirect calorimetry and activity were measured for 5 consecutive days. Body weight was recorded at the beginning and end of the experiment and averaged values were blotted against energy expenditure and activity data as guidelines for experimental design for indirect calorimetry recommended ( Tschöp et al., 2011 96. Tschöp, M.H. ∙ Speakman, J.R. ∙ Arch, J.R.S. ... A guide to analysis of mouse energy metabolism Nat. Methods. 2011; 9 :57-63 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ).
An in-house made mouse tissue library (n = 3 mice) was used to analyze the tissue distribution of mouse Alk mRNA expression. Mouse total RNA was prepared from 8 weeks old B6J mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory and reverse transcribed to cDNA. Post-amplification melting curve analysis was performed to check for unspecific products. For normalization, Alk threshold cycles (Ct-values) were normalized to Rplp0 (ribosomal protein, large P0;) within each sample to obtain sample-specific ΔCt values ( = Ct gene of interest – Ct housekeeping gene ). 2 -ΔΔCt values were calculated to obtain fold expression levels.
Mice (SD; 4 months old) were euthanized with CO2 and perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Dissected brain tissue was fixed overnight at 4°C in 2% PFA and embedded in 1.5% low melting agarose (in PBS). The hypothalamic area was cut into 50μM sections using a vibratome. Sections were stored in PBS. Upon removal of PBS, sections were incubated overnight in LacZ staining solution at 37°C. A paint brush was used to transfer sections into a dish containing PBS ( = washing) and then onto slides. Sections on slide were dried at room temperature and post-fixed in 4% PFA. Sections were then counterstained using Nuclear Fast Red, washed in H2O and stepwise dehydrated in 30, 70, 80, 95 and 100% EtOH followed by an incubation in xylene for one minute each. The following LacZ staining solution was used: 44mL PBS; 2mL K3 (potassium ferricyanide; 500mM); 2mL K4 (potassium ferrocyanide ; 500mM); 0,5mL Na-deoxycholate (1%); 0,1mL MgCl (1M); 10 μL NP-40; 1,25mL Bluo-Gal (100mg in 2,5mL dimethylformamide).
Quantification of mouse (7-11 months old) adipose tissue norepinephrine levels was performed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC-QTOF) mass spectrometry by the West Coast Metabolomics Center (UC Davis) and human adipose samples were analyzed by the NeuroChemistry Core at Vanderbilt University.
Data were generated on C57Bl6/N mice of both sexes on postnatal days 10-23. Single-cell RNA-seq by the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Kit (version 2) was performed on methanol-fixed cells that had been dissociated with the Papain Dissociation System (Worthington). High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq3000 instrument. We used published criteria on hypothalamic neuronal heterogeneity ( Simmons and Swanson, 2009 89. Simmons, D.M. ∙ Swanson, L.W. Comparison of the spatial distribution of seven types of neuroendocrine neurons in the rat paraventricular nucleus: toward a global 3D model J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 516 :423-441 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to distinguish major magnocellular and parvocellular neuronal subtypes of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus by using positional marks of the PVN (such as, e.g., the lack of clock genes and c- fos expression otherwise characterizing Oxt+ and Avp+ neurons of the suprachiasmatic and supraoptic nuclei and lack of Onecut3 transcription factor for Sst neurons ( Romanov et al., 2017 83. Romanov, R.A. ∙ Zeisel, A. ∙ Bakker, J. ... Molecular interrogation of hypothalamic organization reveals distinct dopamine neuronal subtypes Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :176-188 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar )): five cell groups ( Figure 5 C) were obtained and processed by the SCT-pipeline of Seurat 3.1 package ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019; Stuart et al., 2019 34. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R.

Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (472) PubMed Google Scholar ) and visualized by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm ( McInnes et al., 2018 67. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Saul, N. ... UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection J. Open Source Softw, 2018 Google Scholar ). A log-normalized expression matrix was used to derive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each neuronal group against a background with Student’s t test using Bonferroni correction for all genes in the dataset ( Table S5 ). Expression of genes associated with inhibitory GABAergic neurons ( Gad1 ) and excitatory glutamatergic neurons (S lc17a6 ) were correlated with Alk expression. The composition of Alk positive cells was determined by inspecting the occurrence of marker genes characteristic for PVN cell populations as intersection sets ( Conway et al., 2017 14. Conway, J.R. ∙ Lex, A. ∙ Gehlenborg, N. UpSetR: an R package for the visualization of intersecting sets and their properties Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2938-2940 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, major neuropeptide/hormone, neuropeptide receptor and Alk signaling determinants in each of the five major PVN clusters ( Oxt, Avp, Crh, Trh, Sst ) were defined.
5x10 5 SH-SY5Y cells (Sigma #94030304) were electroporated via Maxcyte STX (Cat No. GOC1) with the “luciferase reporter vector” (Addgene ID #99297) utilizing the ORI as a core promoter ( Muerdter et al., 2018 71. Muerdter, F. ∙ Boryń, Ł.M. ∙ Woodfin, A.R. ... Resolving systematic errors in widely used enhancer activity assays in human cells Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :141-149 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) comprising either the putative identified enhancer region spanning the ALK indel rs568057364 or a negative control (Addgene ID #99315) together with a Renilla control vector (Promega # E2261) in a ratio of 10 to 1. After 25min recovery time at 37°C, cells received medium (dmem/f12 supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% fcs) and 1x10ˆ5 cells were diluted into 6well plates. 6h later cells were collected, centrifuged at 500 g and washed with 1xPBS. PBS was removed and cells were lysed using QIAshredder columns (QIAGEN #79654) followed by total RNA extraction via the RNeasy mini prep kit (QIAGEN #74104), with beta-Mercaptoethanol supplemented RLT buffer. 1.5μg of isolated total RNA was treated with TurboDNase (Invitrogen Cat No. AM2238) for 30min at 37°C in a thermocycler. Afterward, 2μl DNase inactivation reagent (Ambion #AM1906) was added and vortexed for 2min, with 20sec breaks within, and centrifuged for 5min at 10,000 g. 10μl of RNA were added to the reverse transcription reaction mixture containing 1μl dt18 (NEB #S1316S), 1μl dNTPs (NEB #4475), 1μl RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher #EN0531), 1μl SuperScript III (Invitrogen #18080093), 1μl DTT (Invitrogen #18080093; within SSIII kit), 4μl forward strand buffer (Invitrogen #18080093, within SSIII kit) and 1μl H 2 0. Reaction was mixed and heated to 25°C for 5min, 50°C for 50min, 70°C for 15min and 4°C for 10min in a thermocycler. Afterward samples got diluted to a total of 100μl and 2μl were used for qPCR. Reaction setup/sample: 10μl SybrGreen (Thermo Fisher #4309155), 1μl forward (10μM), 1μl reverse primer (10μM), 7μl H 2 0 and 2μl cDNA. qPCR setup/whole plate: 95°C 2sec, 95°C 3min, 60°C 30sec, read plate, go back to step 2 for 39 times (40 cycles in total). Post-amplification melting curve analysis was performed to check for unspecific products. For normalization, Firefly threshold cycles (Ct) values were normalized to Renilla Ct values and the normalized negative control values were set as 1 and the DNA fragment spanning ALK variant rs568057364 values were presented as fold change.
Alk fl/fl male mice (2-3 months old) were anaesthetized with isoflurane (5%, Abbot Laboratories) and fixed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf). Anesthesia throughout the procedure was delivered via mouth tubing and maintained between 1.6 and 2.2% of isoflurane in the air. The body temperature was monitored with a rectal thermometer and kept constant at 36°C by a heating pad (DC temperature controller). The mouse head was shaved and 0.1ml of the local anesthetic Xylanaest 0.5% (Gebro Pharma) injected subcutaneously. The skull was exposed, cleaned and small holes were drilled bilaterally above the PVN, at coordinates: AP −0.82, ML ± 0.35, DV −4.9, relative to bregma ( Paxinos and Franklin, 2007 76. Paxinos, G. ∙ Franklin, K.B.J. The mouse brain in stereotaxic coordinates Elsevier Science, 2007 Google Scholar ). Mice were injected with 45nl/injection site of 1:10 mixture of AAV::DIO-GFP (Cre-dependent GFP, 0.1 × 10 11 GC/mL) and AAV::Cre (1 × 10 12 GC/mL) viral vectors; control mice received injection of AAV::GFP (1.15 × 10 13 GC/mL). Vectors were delivered to the PVN via a thin glass pipette and the injection was controlled by a Micro4 Micro Syringe Pump (World Precision Instruments; injection volume 45nl/site, delivery rate 15nl/min). To prevent backflow, the pipette was left at the injection site for 3 min after the injection was finished. Mice were let to recover for at least one week after the surgery and during that time their drinking water was supplied with enrofloxacine 0.1mg/mL (Baytril, Bayer) and caprofen 0.2mg/mL (Rimadyl, Pfizer). At the end of the experiment, mice were euthanized using CO 2 followed by histological validation of correct viral targeting of the PVN.
Fasted mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Figures 6 D and 6I and S8 H: SD; 4 months old. Figure 6 E: 5 months old and 8 weeks on HFD. Figure 6 H: 6 months old and 14 weeks on HFD. Mouse tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer (Sigma; R0278) containing Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific; 78440). Western blotting was carried out using standard protocols. Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% Phosphoblocker Blocking Rgnt (Cell Biolabs; AKR-103) in TBST (1 × TBS and 0.1% Tween-20) and were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in 5% Phosphoblocker in TBST (1:1000 dilution). Blots were washed three times in TBST for 15 min, then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in 5% Phosphoblocker in TBST (1:2500 dilution) for 45 min at room temperature, washed three times in TBST for 15 min and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Pierce, 1896327). The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma, A5316); anti-HSL (Cell Signaling, 4107), anti-phospho-HSL (Ser660) (Cell Signaling, 4126) and anti-Ucp1 (Abcam, ab10983). Secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit IgG HRP (GE Healthcare, NA9340V) and anti-mouse IgG HRP (Promega, W4021). Quantification of western blot bands was performed by selection of equal sized areas of Ucp1 and Actin. The positively stained area was quantified using the gel analysis tool in ImageJ and the ratio of Ucp1 and Actin was calculated.
Figure 5 B: Mouse tissues (SD: 4 months old) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit from QIAGEN and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit from BioRad. qPCR reactions were performed in the CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad) using the GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega). Post-amplification melting curve analysis was performed to check for unspecific products. For normalization, threshold cycles (Ct-values) were normalized to Hprt within each sample to obtain sample-specific ΔCt values ( = Ct gene of interest – Ct housekeeping gene ). 2 -ΔΔCt values were calculated to obtain fold expression levels. Fasted values were set as 100% and refed values were presented as percentage change.
Figures 6 F and 6G and S8 I: Mouse tissues (SD: 4 months old; HFD: 4 months old and 1 month on HFD) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from tissue using TRIzol (Thermo Scientific #15596018) and treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific #EN0521) for genomic DNA digestion prior cDNA synthesis. 1μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (RevertAid RT Kit, Thermo Scientific #K1691) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX), Roche #04913914001) using a QuantStudio 6 RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Post-amplification melting curve analysis was performed to check for unspecific products. For normalization, threshold cycles (Ct-values) were normalized to 36B4 within each sample to obtain sample-specific ΔCt values ( = Ct gene of interest – Ct housekeeping gene ). 2 -ΔΔCt values were calculated to obtain fold expression levels. Wild-type values were set as 1 and knockout values were presented as fold change.
Figure S8 K: Mouse tissues (5 months old; 1 month on HFD) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using PeqGold Trifast (VWR) and reverse transcribed with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using a universal probes mix (BioRad) on a CFX cycler and analyzed with CFX software (BioRad). For normalization, threshold cycles (Ct-values) were normalized to Rpl4 , Oaz1 and Rpl13a within each sample to obtain sample-specific ΔCt values ( = Ct gene of interest – Ct housekeeping gene ). 2 -ΔΔCt values were calculated to obtain fold expression levels. Wild-type values were set as 1 and knockout values were presented as fold change.
Estimate of IBS (identity by state) between each pair of samples, based on a pruned subset of SNPs, was required to evaluate the extent of relatedness between samples. This pruned subset of SNPs was obtained by following the steps below:
Prune extracted SNPs for r2 > 0.2 using a sliding window of 50 SNPs with a 5 SNP overlap (PLINK command options–indep 50 5 1.25). Estimation of IBS was achieved by using plink: plink–bfile mydata.pruned–Z-genome. We can then identify all pairs of samples with pi_hat > 0.3 as “related” (threshold may vary between cohorts). For each pair of samples with pi_hat > 0.3, samples were selected for exclusion using the following criteria: 1) Exclude any sample that is related to more than one other sample; 2) Exclude the sample with lowest call rate on the basis of all variants passing QC.
Principal components (PCs) were calculated to identify ethnic outliers and to evaluate the extent of population stratification within cohorts. Principal components were constructed on the basis of the IBS estimated in the previous step using the pruned subset of SNPs. The PLINK v1.9 command line was: "plink -bfile egcut_data -read-genome egcut_data.pruned.genome.gz -cluster-mds-plot 10". The projection of each sample was recorded onto the first ten principal components (PCs) for use in downstream analyses to adjust for population structure. Clear non-European outliers were excluded. For scatterplot, 1000 Genomes CEU, YRI and CHB/JPT were used for anchoring.
Statistical analysis was performed with SNPTEST ( Marchini et al., 2007 66. Marchini, J. ∙ Howie, B. ∙ Myers, S. ... A new multipoint method for genome-wide association studies by imputation of genotypes Nat. Genet. 2007; 39 :906-913 Crossref Scopus (1749) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the method ‘expected’. Covariates included gender, age and the four first components from a Principal Component Analysis on genotype data (to account for possible population stratification).
Two case-control analyses (logistic regression) were performed:
ANALYSIS 1 : healthy thin as cases and healthy control weight subjects (controls) as controls ; healthy thin ∼SNP + sex + age + population stratification PCs.
ANALYSIS 2 : healthy overweight and/or obese subjects as cases and healthy normal weight subjects (controls) as controls; healthy overweight and/or obese ∼SNP + sex + age + population stratification PCs.
Upon analysis, no abnormal p value inflations were seen on QQ plots (not shown).
These analyses were performed to evaluate whether the ALK indels would remain associated with the thinness status (relative to healthy controls) when adjusting for 4 ALK variants associated with BMI. Analyses were performed using the following logistic regression; controls ; healthy thin ∼SNP + age + sex + population stratification PCs + 4 ALK variants associated with BMI.
These analyses aimed to evaluate whether the ALK genetic effect from our indels, was dependent on the subject’s age. Analyses were performed using the following logistic regression; controls ; healthy thin ∼SNP ∗ age + sex + population stratification PCs.
UK Biobank data was analyzed as a part of project 17085. Non-European ancestry was used as exclusion criteria. The age distribution in the UKBB was significantly higher than in the EGCUT biobank (age range of 40-69 with the youngest individual being 37 years old). To align the data with our current analysis we only considered the age group 41-45 which showed a similar BMI distribution as the respective age group in the Estonian biobank. Sample size of the thin individuals by selecting the 6 th lowest percentile was 2527 individuals (1167 male and 1360 females) and 8430 (3898 males and 4532 females) for the control individuals (30-50th percentile). The analysis was performed using BOLT-LMM v2.3 software using sex, age and the first 15 PCs as covariates ( Loh et al., 2018 58. Loh, P.-R. ∙ Kichaev, G. ∙ Gazal, S. ... Mixed-model association for biobank-scale datasets Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :906-908 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Expression in 10 different brain regions and genotype were retrieved for 134 subjects from the Brain Almanac ( http://www.braineac.org/ ) ( Huckins et al., 2019 41.

Missing expression values were imputed using chained-equation (using MICE ( van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011 99. van Buuren, S. ∙ Groothuis-Oudshoorn, K. mice: Multivariate imputation by chained equations in R J. Stat. Softw. 2011; Crossref Google Scholar ), with settings m = 5, maxit = 50, method = pmm). Subsequent eQTL analyses focused on the t2546409 probeset and used the MatrixEQTL ( Shabalin, 2012 88. Shabalin, A.A. Matrix eQTL: ultra fast eQTL analysis via large matrix operations Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :1353-1358 Crossref Scopus (544) PubMed Google Scholar ) package with a linear model. Next, for SNPs displaying at least R-square > 50% with our indels, we performed a multi-marker analysis using GATES ( Li et al., 2011 53. Li, M.X. ∙ Gui, H.S. ∙ Kwan, J.S.H. ... GATES: a rapid and powerful gene-based association test using extended Simes procedure Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011; 88 :283-293 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ), as implemented in the aSPU R package ( Pan et al., 2014 75. Pan, W. ∙ Kim, J. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... A powerful and adaptive association test for rare variants Genetics. 2014; 197 :1081-1095 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Molecular QTL (p-/e-/m-QTL) and overlap with published GWA hits for the ALK variants were retrieved from the PhenoScanner ( Kamat et al., 2019; Staley et al., 2016 45. Kamat, M.A. ∙ Blackshaw, J.A. ∙ Young, R. ... PhenoScanner V2: an expanded tool for searching human genotype-phenotype associations Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :4851-4853 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar 90.

PhenoScanner: a database of human genotype-phenotype associations Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :3207-3209 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ) database. Allele frequencies and LD relationship for our two indels in different populations were retrieved from the 1000G project ( Auton et al., 2015 4. Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ∙ Durbin, R.M. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (4710) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the LDlink portal ( https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/ ) ( Machiela and Chanock, 2015 62. Machiela, M.J. ∙ Chanock, S.J. LDlink: a web-based application for exploring population-specific haplotype structure and linking correlated alleles of possible functional variants Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3555-3557 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Chromatin state annotation of the locus around the two top ALK indels was evaluated using the Epigenome browser ( https://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/ ; ( Li et al., 2019 55. Li, D. ∙ Hsu, S. ∙ Purushotham, D. ... WashU Epigenome Browser update 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W158-W165 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar )). PrimaryHMM tracks (15 state core model) from the public data hub were used to visualize the regulatory state of the different human cell lines and tissues form the Roadmap Epigenomic Project.
All mouse data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was tested by Student’s two tailed, unpaired t test; Mann-Whitney U test; 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test or Analysis of Co-Variance (ANCOVA) using body weight as covariate where appropriate ( Tschöp et al., 2011 96. Tschöp, M.H. ∙ Speakman, J.R. ∙ Arch, J.R.S. ... A guide to analysis of mouse energy metabolism Nat. Methods. 2011; 9 :57-63 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ). All figures and mouse statistical analyses were generated using Prism 8 (GraphPad) or R. Details of the statistical tests used are stated in the figure legends. In all figures, statistical significance is represented as ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
