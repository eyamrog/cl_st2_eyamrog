Title: Cryo-EM Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2-G i Signaling Complex


Abstract: Summary

Drugs selectively targeting CB2 hold promise for treating neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation, and pain while avoiding psychotropic side effects mediated by CB1. The mechanisms underlying CB2 activation and signaling are poorly understood but critical for drug design. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the human CB2-G i signaling complex bound to the agonist WIN 55,212-2. The 3D structure reveals the binding mode of WIN 55,212-2 and structural determinants for distinguishing CB2 agonists from antagonists, which are supported by a pair of rationally designed agonist and antagonist. Further structural analyses with computational docking results uncover the differences between CB2 and CB1 in receptor activation, ligand recognition, and G i coupling. These findings are expected to facilitate rational structure-based discovery of drugs targeting the cannabinoid system.

Section: Introduction

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) includes two major G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), cannabinoid receptor subtypes 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2), which mediate the biophysiological activities of the phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and several endogenous cannabinoids. ECS is a complex and homeostatic system that is involved in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological processes such as appetite regulation ( Kirkham, 2005 29. Kirkham, T.C.

Efforts have been made to develop selective CB1 and CB2 ligands that can modulate these biological functions and treat associated diseases. Although some CB2-selective agonists have been developed, showing certain efficacy in animal models or in vitro assays ( Leleu-Chavain et al., 2019; Nettekoven et al., 2016; Scott et al., 2019; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016; Mugnaini et al., 2019 33.

As a therapeutic target, CB2 has a notable advantage over CB1 in its pattern of expression. CB1 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and is the primary receptor responsible for the psychotropic effects of THC and the deleterious psychiatric side effects of CB1-targeting drugs. The CB1 inverse agonists rimonabant and taranabant (MK-0364) were developed as anti-obesity drugs, but both produce crippling CNS side effects of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation ( Aronne et al., 2010; Proietto et al., 2010; Moreira and Crippa, 2009 3. Aronne, L.J. ∙ Tonstad, S. ∙ Moreno, M. ... A clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of taranabant, a CB1R inverse agonist, in obese and overweight patients: a high-dose study Int. J.

In contrast, CB2 is predominantly expressed in peripheral tissues of the immune system, such as the spleen and thymus, where it modulates immune suppression, apoptosis, and cell migration ( Yang et al., 2012a; Galiègue et al., 1995 16. Galiègue, S. ∙ Mary, S. ∙ Marchand, J. ... Expression of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors in human immune tissues and leukocyte subpopulations Eur. J.

Lead discovery, chemistry optimization, and biological evaluation studies of novel biamide derivatives as CB2 receptor inverse agonists and osteoclast inhibitors J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55 :9973-9987 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Modest levels of CB2 expression have also been observed in several areas of the brain, such as ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons and hippocampal CA3 neurons ( Onaivi et al., 2006 50. Onaivi, E.S. ∙ Ishiguro, H. ∙ Gong, J.P. ... Discovery of the presence and functional expression of cannabinoid CB2 receptors in brain Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2006; 1074 :514-536 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ), which regulate cravings of drug addiction and memory processes, respectively ( Chen et al., 2017 7.

Thus, it is believed that targeting the CB2 receptor and CB2 structure-based design offer promising avenues of new drug discovery for treatment of a number of disorders while avoiding the severe psychiatric side effects associated with CB1 ( Seely et al., 2011 62. Seely, K.A. ∙ Prather, P.L. ∙ James, L.P. ... Marijuana-based drugs: innovative therapeutics or designer drugs of abuse? Mol. Interv. 2011; 11 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Activated CB2 mainly couples to the G i/o family and induces G i/o -mediated signaling pathways, although G q/11 coupling has also been reported ( Ibsen et al., 2017 23. Ibsen, M.S. ∙ Connor, M. ∙ Glass, M. Cannabinoid CB 1 and CB 2 Receptor Signaling and Bias Cannabis Cannabinoid Res. 2017; 2 :48-60 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). CB2 antagonists and inverse agonists have been reported to promote osteoclast apoptosis and prevent bone loss ( Idris et al., 2005 25. Idris, A.I. ∙ van ’t Hof, R.J. ∙ Greig, I.R. ... Regulation of bone mass, bone loss and osteoclast activity by cannabinoid receptors Nat. Med. 2005; 11 :774-779 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, a large body of evidence has indicated a broad therapeutic application of CB2 agonists in neurodegenerative disorders ( Aso and Ferrer, 2016; Gómez-Gálvez et al., 2016 4.

Brain cannabinoid receptor 2: expression, function and modulation Acta Pharmacol.

Drug Targets. 2018; 18 :34-51 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), and neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain ( Lisboa et al., 2018; Turcotte et al., 2016; Guindon and Hohmann, 2008 18.

Life Sci. 2016; 73 :4449-4470 Crossref Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, lack of a well-defined CB2 ligand activation and signaling mechanism has hindered development of synthetic CB2 agonists.
WIN 55,212-2 ((R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone) is a representative agonist of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 (K i = 62.3 nM and 3.3 nM, respectively), and it has been used extensively to investigate cannabinoid receptor function. In animal models, WIN 55,212-2 has demonstrated efficacy in treating several disease states, including pain ( Mohammadi Vosough et al., 2019 45.

Citraro, R. ∙ Russo, E. ∙ Leo, A. ... Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic influence of N-palmitoylethanolamine, arachidonyl-2′-chloroethylamide and WIN 55,212-2 on the anticonvulsant activity of antiepileptic drugs against audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2016; 791 :523-534 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), and cancer ( Roberto et al., 2019 57. Roberto, D. ∙ Klotz, L.H. ∙ Venkateswaran, V. Cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in prostate cancer in a cannabinoid-receptor 2 dependent manner Prostate. 2019; 79 :151-159 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike most CB1 and CB2 agonists, WIN 55,212-2 activates G protein signaling pathways without eliciting CB2 internalization, a property that putatively avoids drug tolerance development. Here we report a 3.2-Å cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human CB2 bound to the potent agonist WIN 55,212-2 in complex with G i . Analyses of the ligand binding pocket, the CB2-G i signaling complex, and conformational dynamics of activated CB2 are conducted by comparisons and contrasts with previously reported structures of inverse agonist-bound CB2 and inverse agonist or agonist-bound CB1. We developed and applied an innovative residual energy calculation algorithm to aid in the design of a pair of selective CB2 agonist and inverse agonist to validate our putative mechanism of receptor activation involving the structural arrangement of critical residues. Our results provide insightful information to facilitate structure-based design and discovery of high-affinity and/or high-selectivity CB2 ligands that can be developed as CB2-targeting therapeutic agents.

Section: Results

To obtain a stable complex of CB2 bound to WIN 55,212-2 and G i , we co-expressed human CB2 with heterotrimeric G i protein in insect cells ( Figure S1 ). The receptor-G i complexes were assembled on the membrane by incubation with WIN 55,212-2 and apyrase. In addition, the antibody fragment scFv16 was added to stabilize the nucleotide-free G i complex by binding to the interface between Gα i and Gβ ( Maeda et al., 2018 39. Maeda, S. ∙ Koehl, A. ∙ Matile, H. ... Development of an antibody fragment that stabilizes GPCR/G-protein complexes Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3712 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CB2-WIN 55,212-2-G i -scFv16 complex was then purified through sequential steps of affinity chromatography to homogeneity, yielding a relatively thermostable complex suitable for single-particle cryo-EM analysis ( Figure S1 ).
The structure of the CB2-WIN 55,212-2-G i -scFv16 complex ( Figure 1 ) was determined from 772,000 particles to a nominal resolution of 3.2 Å ( Figure S2 ), which allowed unambiguous assignment of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of CB2, G i protein, as well as the antibody fragment in the EM density maps ( Figure S3 ). The α-helical domain (AHD) of Gα i , which is poorly resolved in most cryo-EM GPCR-G protein complex structures, is resolved in our CB2-G i complex structure with a relatively low resolution compared with that of the core structure of this complex. The overall structures were built by rigid body fit of an online homology building model ( Kelley et al., 2015 28. Kelley, L.A. ∙ Mezulis, S. ∙ Yates, C.M. ... The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :845-858 Crossref Scopus (7220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Apart from the AHD of the G i protein, the majority of the amino acid side chains were well resolved in the final models against the EM density map with excellent geometry ( Table S1 ).
The EM density map shows the binding mode of the CB2 agonist WIN 55,212-2 in the orthosteric binding site in the TMD of CB2. The orientation of the agonist was determined with the electron density and the chemical and geometric constraints of the binding pocket of CB2 ( Figure 2 ). To further validate the binding pose of WIN 55,212-2 in the ligand-binding pocket of CB2, we conducted molecular docking ( Figure S4 A) using three different software packages or algorithms: Schrödinger-Glide, Auto Dock, and SYBYL-Surflex Dock. The pose of WIN 55,212-2 depicted in our complex structure ( Figure S4 A) was scored as the top one or two from all three algorithms with the lowest binding energies. We also performed a molecular dynamics simulation, and the results showed that the pose of WIN 55,212-2 in the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket of CB2 is stable ( Figures S4 B–S4D). The binding interface between WIN 55,212-2 and CB2 is also supported by previously reported mutagenesis-based and structural studies ( Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2011; McAllister et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2002 34.

As shown in Figure 2 , the binding pocket of WIN 55,212-2, buried in the transmembrane (TM) region, is formed by residues from TM2–TM3 and TM5–TM7 and capped by extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). The naphthalene moiety of WIN 55,212-2 extends between TM2 and TM3 and is predicted to form strong π-π interactions with F91 2.61 and F94 2.64 and hydrophobic interactions with F87 2.57 , H95 2.65 , P184 ECL2 , and F281 7.35 . These results are consistent with the findings from Li et al. (2019) 34. Li, X. ∙ Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2 Cell. 2019; 176 :459-467.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar , who reported that F87 2.57 , F91 2.61 , F94 2.64 , and H95 2.65 in TM2 are important for recognition of the CB2 antagonist AM10257. Furthermore, our cryo-EM data reveal that the core structure of WIN 55,212-2 (2,3-dihydro-[1,4]oxazino[2,3,4- hi ]indole) points downward and engages in π-π interactions with F117 3.36 and W258 6.48 . It also interacts with I110 3.29 , V113 3.32 , F183 ECL2 , V261 6.51 , and M265 6.55 via hydrophobic interactions, which have been shown previously to play key roles in ligand binding of CB2. The morpholine moiety of WIN 55,212-2, which adopts the chair conformation, approaches TM5 and ECL2 to form additional hydrophobic interactions with critical residues that have been reported to function in ligand binding ( Feng et al., 2014 13. Feng, Z. ∙ Alqarni, M.H. ∙ Yang, P. ... Modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and mutation validation for structure of cannabinoid receptor 2 based on known crystal structures of GPCRs J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2014; 54 :2483-2499 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ), including F183 ECL2 , I186 ECL2 , and W194 5.43 .
WIN 55,212-2 has a certain similarity to the antagonist AM10257 in binding to the receptor, but noteworthy differences also exist. From the structural alignment shown in Figure 3 A, we may infer that AM10257 (antagonist) and WIN 55,212-2 (agonist) share a similar binding pocket and that most of the interactions with the receptor are conserved ( Figure 3 A). In addition, the volume of the WIN 55,212-2 binding site within active CB2 (∼415 Å 3 ) is similar to that of the AM10257 binding site (antagonist, ∼447 Å 3 ). One significant difference is that AM10257 (antagonist; Figure 3 A, orange sticks) inserts deeper (2.8 Å) into the binding pocket compared with WIN 55,212-2 (agonist; Figure 3 A, cyan sticks), which results in different conformations of the toggle switch residue W258 6.48 . W258 6.48 is a highly conserved residue in class A GPCRs and has been reported to have a crucial role in GPCR activation ( Lin and Sakmar, 1996 37. Lin, S.W. ∙ Sakmar, T.P. Specific tryptophan UV-absorbance changes are probes of the transition of rhodopsin to its active state Biochemistry. 1996; 35 :11149-11159 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). In comparison with the inactive CB2, our data showed that W258 6.48 undergoes a 64° clockwise rotation and F117 3.36 a 10° counterclockwise rotation in the active CB2 ( Figures 3 A and 3B). We also noted that the distance between W258 6.48 and WIN 55,212-2 is about 5.0 Å, greater than that observed for AM10257 (∼3.8 Å). Therefore, the steric effects of CB2 ligands on W258 6.48 appear to play critical roles in determining ligand efficacy.
To further explore the role of critical residues on CB2 activation, we calculated the individual residue energy contribution to determine how much certain residues contribute to the binding of WIN 55,212-2. Briefly, the total binding energy of WIN 55,212-2 at CB2 is the sum of intra-ligand free energy (the energy of WIN 55,212-2) and inter-ligand free energy (the energy between WIN 55,212-2 and residues in CB2), with the latter component further divided into energy contributions from each residue. We quantitatively calculated and compared the residual energy contributions between the inactive and active CB2. Although most of the residues contribute equally to recognition of both antagonist-AM10257 ( Figure 3 C, green bars) and agonist-WIN 55,212-2 ( Figure 3 C, magenta bars), three residues, W194 5.43 , F117 3.36 , and W258 6.48 , were found to potentially play important roles in distinguishing agonist from antagonist. This occurs in a manner not requiring direct interaction because they are too far from the WIN 55,212-2 molecule to significantly contribute to its recognition as an agonist ( Figure 3 C). Several mutagenesis studies from our group and others ( Zhang et al., 2011; McAllister et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2002 43. McAllister, S.D. ∙ Hurst, D.P. ∙ Barnett-Norris, J. ...

Chem. 2004; 279 :48024-48037 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar 63. Singh, R. ∙ Hurst, D.P. ∙ Barnett-Norris, J. ... Activation of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor may involve a W6 48/F3 36 rotamer toggle switch J. Pept. Res. 2002; 60 :357-370 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar 75. Zhang, Y. ∙ Xie, Z. ∙ Wang, L. ... Mutagenesis and computer modeling studies of a GPCR conserved residue W5.43(194) in ligand recognition and signal transduction for CB2 receptor Int. Immunopharmacol. 2011; 11 :1303-1310 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) also provided evidence of the importance of these three residues in terms of WIN 55,212-2 binding and CB2 activation, further validating our residual energy contribution algorithm. This derivation aids in predicting how to design a functional agonist/antagonist pair based on 3D structure.
To further investigate and validate the structural findings, we rationally designed and synthesized two structurally related CB2-selective compounds and also measured the binding affinity K i to CB1 and CB2, XIE55 (CB2 K i = 138 nM, CB1/CB2 > 1,000) and XIE57 (CB2 K i = 639 nM, CB1/CB2 > 1,000). They share the same pharmacophore but with different chemical moieties; XIE55 has a phenylethylene group, whereas XIE57 has a thiophene ring ( Figure 4 A; Figure S5 ). Congruently, cyclic AMP (cAMP) functional assays determined that XIE55 behaves as an inverse agonist and XIE57 acts as a partial agonist of CB2. Molecular docking also showed that these two ligands adopt similar binding poses to interact with CB2 ( Figure 4 C). The most different feature is that the agonist XIE57 does not extend sufficiently deep to constrain the conformation of W258 6.48 with a distance of 5.5 Å, whereas the inverse agonist XIE55 approaches closer to W258 6.48 to form potentially strong π-π interactions (3.0 Å), which is consistent with our structural analysis of the action of WIN 55,212-2 and AM10257, addressed above. This pair of small molecules (XIE55 and XIE57) serves as a “proof of concept” of our method and investigation that can be applied by other researchers in the field for design and discovery of CB2 functional ligands.
To explore the differences in receptor activation between CB2 and CB1, we aligned the agonist-bound CB2-G i and agonist-bound CB1-G i complexes. Although the two ligands, WIN 55,212-2 and Methyl (S)-2-(1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate (MDMB)-Fubinaca (FUB), overlap very well, the critical “toggle switch” residues W 6.48 and F 3.36 show differences. Specifically, W356 6.48 in CB1 is positioned about 2.3 Å up toward the extracellular surface, and F200 3.36 in CB1 is rotated 68° compared with the analogous residues in CB2 ( Figure 5 A). As a result, the distance between W356 6.48 and F200 3.36 in CB1 (4.8 Å) is longer than that in CB2 (3.4 Å). Similarly, the different arrangement of the toggle switch causes a 74° counterclockwise rotation of F202 5.51 in TM5 of CB2 in comparison with the corresponding residue L287 5.51 in CB1. Other residues involved in orthosteric binding in CB receptors, especially those from TM2 and ECL2, show some conformational differences as well ( Figure 5 A). Interestingly, the conformation and position of ECLs remain largely unchanged during receptor activation, which can likely be attributed to the C174-C179 disulfide bond and a rigid motif of “PXP” (P176 and P178). We also observed modest upward shifts of residues on the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM6 of CB2 relative to those of CB1 ( Figure 5 B), which leads to a shift of Y 7.53 in the NPXXY motif away from Y 5.58 and L 6.41 in CB2 compared with that in CB1. Such structural differences in the ligand-binding pockets are associated with observed differences in the conformation of TM5 and TM6 and the G i coupling interface between CB1 and CB2, indicating that the activation mechanisms of CB1 and CB2 are not the same. All of these structural alterations may be also associated with the distinct interactions of G proteins between CB1 and CB2 (discussed below).
To compare the selectivity between CB2 and CB1, we conducted molecular docking studies and calculated the residual energy contribution for GW-405,833 (L-768,242) on active CB2 and inactive CB1 (PDB: 5TGZ ) ( Hua et al., 2016 22. Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ∙ Pu, M. ... Crystal structure of the human cannabinoid receptor CB1 Cell. 2016; 167 :750-762.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). GW-405,833, a dual-function compound ( Dhopeshwarkar et al., 2017 10. Dhopeshwarkar, A. ∙ Murataeva, N. ∙ Makriyannis, A. ... Two Janus cannabinoids that are both CB2 agonists and CB1 antagonists J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2017; 360 :300-311 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), acts as a highly selective partial agonist on CB2 (K i = 3.92 ± 1.58 nM) but as an antagonist on CB1 (K i = 4772 ± 1,676 nM). The docking poses of GW-405,833 on these two receptors are quite different, as shown in Figure 6 A. Moreover, the binding energy of GW-405,833 on CB2 (−10.83 kcal/mol) is greater than that on CB1 (−6.66 kcal/mol), which is consistent with the reported binding affinities for CB2 and CB1. Sequentially, the residual energy contributions for GW-405,833 binding on both CB2 and CB1 were calculated and compared ( Figure 6 B). Several residues on inactive CB1, including P102 (N terminus), M103 (N terminus), I105 (N terminus), F170 2.57 , and W356 6.48 , are important for GW-405,833 binding. In particular, W356 6.48 on CB1 contributes greatly (−0.94 kcal/mol) to recognition of GW-405,833 as an antagonist. However, the energy contribution of the corresponding residue W258 6.48 on CB2 for the partial agonist GW-405,833 is −0.15 kcal/mol ( Figure 6 B), which is similar to that for WIN 55,212-2. Importantly, L182 ECL2 , F183 ECL2 , P184 ECL2 , and I186 ECL2 from ECL2 show greater contributions to binding of GW-405,833 on CB2 than the corresponding residues on CB1 ( Figure 6 B), supporting findings from previous studies ( Raitio et al., 2005 55. Raitio, K.H. ∙ Salo, O.M. ∙ Nevalainen, T. ... Targeting the cannabinoid CB2 receptor: mutations, modeling and development of CB2 selective ligands Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12 :1217-1237 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The overall cryo-EM structure of the CB2-G i complex reveals a similar interaction mode between the receptor and G protein compared with other G i or G s -coupled receptors ( Figure S6 ). The C-terminal α5 helix of the Gα i subunit inserts into the cavity at the cytoplasmic site of CB2 to form the major interaction interface with residues from TM2, ICL2, TM3, TM5, and TM6 of the receptor. When aligned with the reported μ-opioid receptor (μOR)-G i (PDB: 6DDE ) and β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR)-G s (PDB: 3SN6 ) complexes ( Rasmussen et al., 2011 56. Rasmussen, S.G. ∙ DeVree, B.T. ∙ Zou, Y. ... Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex Nature. 2011; 477 :549-555 Crossref Scopus (2472) PubMed Google Scholar ), the α5 helix in CB2-G i is rotated by 18° and 14°, respectively, along the axis of the membrane ( Figures S6 A and 6 B). However, several striking differences in G i protein coupling between CB2 and CB1 can be observed. For example, the N terminus of the α5 helix of Gα i in CB2-G i is closer to TM5 ( Figure 7 A) and inserts deeper into the receptor binding cavity than those in Rhodopsin-G i (PDB: 6CMO ; Kang et al., 2018 27. Kang, Y. ∙ Kuybeda, O. ∙ de Waal, P.W. ... Cryo-EM structure of human rhodopsin bound to an inhibitory G protein Nature. 2018; 558 :553-558 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CB1-G i (PDB: 6N4B ; Li et al., 2019 34. Li, X. ∙ Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2 Cell. 2019; 176 :459-467.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ) complexes, as pointed out above. As a result, CB2 forms a more extensive hydrogen-bonding network with the α5 helix of Gα i than that found in the structure of CB1-G i ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Specifically, compared with the five hydrophilic interactions between CB1 and Gα i ( Li et al., 2019 34. Li, X. ∙ Hua, T. ∙ Vemuri, K. ... Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2 Cell. 2019; 176 :459-467.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ), eight pairs of hydrogen bonds can be observed between CB2 and the α5 helix ( Figure 7 B). K67 2.37 and S69 2.39 in the intracellular side of TM2 are observed to form hydrogen bonds with D350 and C351 in the α5 helix, respectively. K142 ICL2 in ICL2 interacts with both N347 and D350 via strong hydrogen bond interactions. R131 3.50 , a residue of the “ionic lock” in TM3, also forms a hydrogen bond with C351. In addition, H219 5.68 and H226 5.75 in TM5 approach D341 and D337 in α5 to form two hydrogen bonds. Finally, we also observed a hydrogen bond between R242 6.32 and F354. In contrast to CB1, ICL3 in CB2 is well structured and directly interacts with G i . As shown in Figure 7 D, an additional α-helix is formed by residues from ICL3 and TM6, including R229 ICL3 , Q230 ICL3 , V231 6.21 , and P232 6.22 . Two polar residues from ICL3, Q227 ICL3 and R229 ICL3 , form additional hydrogen bonds with Q304 and E297 of Gα i , which are absent in the CB1-G i complex ( Figure S7 ).
Although CB1 and μOR primarily signal through the G i/o family, previous studies suggested that they can also couple to G s ( Krishna Kumar et al., 2019 31. Krishna Kumar, K. ∙ Shalev-Benami, M. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of a Signaling Cannabinoid Receptor 1-G protein complex Cell. 2019; 176 :448-458.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, CB2 does not couple to the G s family. On the other hand, ICL2 point mutations P139F, P139M, or P139L allow CB2 to couple to G s in a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-driven luciferase assay ( Zheng et al., 2013 76. Zheng, C. ∙ Chen, L. ∙ Chen, X. ... The second intracellular loop of the human cannabinoid CB2 receptor governs G protein coupling in coordination with the carboxyl terminal domain PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e63262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, a CB2 P139L mutant could activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) through both G i - and G s -mediated pathways ( Zheng et al., 2013 76. Zheng, C. ∙ Chen, L. ∙ Chen, X. ... The second intracellular loop of the human cannabinoid CB2 receptor governs G protein coupling in coordination with the carboxyl terminal domain PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e63262 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, when L222 of CB1 (corresponding to P139 of CB2) is mutated to proline, G s coupling is lost, but coupling to G i is retained ( Timossi et al., 2002 65. Timossi, C. ∙ Maldonado, D. ∙ Vizcaíno, A. ... Structural determinants in the second intracellular loop of the human follicle-stimulating hormone receptor are involved in G(s) protein activation Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 189 :157-168 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies, together with previous cross-linking studies ( Mnpotra et al., 2014 44. Mnpotra, J.S. ∙ Qiao, Z. ∙ Cai, J. ... Structural basis of G protein-coupled receptor-Gi protein interaction: formation of the cannabinoid CB2 receptor-Gi protein complex J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :20259-20272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggest an important role of P139 ICL2 in G protein selectivity and coupling for CB2.
In our cryo-EM structure, P139 ICL2 in CB2 interacts with L194 in the β2-β3 loop of G i but is away from the hydrophobic pocket formed by L194, I343, T340, and F336 in G i ( Figure 7 E). It has been suggested that, for CB1, the corresponding residue of P139 ICL2 in CB2, L222 ICL2 ( Figure 7 F), may engage a similar hydrophobic pocket when coupled to G s , which is important for G s recognition ( Krishna Kumar et al., 2019 31. Krishna Kumar, K. ∙ Shalev-Benami, M. ∙ Robertson, M.J. ... Structure of a Signaling Cannabinoid Receptor 1-G protein complex Cell. 2019; 176 :448-458.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the P139 ICL2 in CB2 may not permit interactions with the hydrophobic pocket in G s because of the rigid “P138 ICL2 P139 ICL2 ” motif, leading to high selectivity of CB2 for G i over G s . Consistently, mutation of CB2 P139 ICL2 to bulkier residues, such as Phe or Leu, might allow such coupling interactions with G s to be regained.

Section: Discussion

Delineating the CB2 structural basis for ligand recognition and G protein recruitment will facilitate rational design and development of drugs with high affinity and selectivity as well as optimal therapeutic effects. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of an agonist-bound CB2-G i signaling complex and detailed interactions between the potent agonist WIN 55,212-2 and the receptor, the key residues determining ligand selectivity and efficacy, the differences in activation mechanisms between CB2 and CB1, and the unique molecular features of the CB2-G i protein interaction. A video of the 3D protein structure can be found at https://youtu.be/x8ucDtoLJi0 for an illustration (the video was not part of the peer review process).
Our 3D cryo-EM structure of CB2 reveals that WIN 55,212-2 occupies the same orthosteric binding pocket as the antagonist AM10257 in CB2 and that it stabilizes the CB2-G i complex in its active conformation through interference with the toggle switch residue W258 6.48 , which is critical for distinguishing agonists from antagonists. ECL2 and residues from TM2, TM3, and TM6 play important roles in CB2 ligand recognition and ligand selectivity. This provides an advanced strategy for rational design of CB2-selective agonists. The divergent conformation of W 6.48 in CB1 versus CB2 is associated with a series of distinct residue rearrangements in the intracellular side of TM5, TM6, and TM7 of CB2, as addressed above, which distinguish the activation and G i signaling mechanism of CB2 from that of CB1. Although several synthetic CB2-selective agonists, including thiophene-containing compounds, have been reported recently ( Scott et al., 2019; Leleu-Chavain et al., 2019; Nettekoven et al., 2016; Mugnaini et al., 2019; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016 33.

The results presented here are likely to aid in the development of potent and selective CB2 ligands with clinical therapy potential.
Comparison of the CB2-G i complex with CB1-G i , Rhodopsin-G i , μOR-G i , and β 2 AR-G s complexes reveals certain similar overall interaction profiles for receptor-G protein binding. Although CB2 and CB1 share great structural similarity, their interactions with the α5 helix of the G protein remain distinct, reflecting the versatility of G i coupling. P139 ICL2 in CB2 and the homologous residue in other GPCRs are critical for G protein coupling, and the unique motif of P138 ICL2 P139 ICL2 in ICL2 of CB2 contributes to its G i coupling specificity. The well-resolved ICL3 structure provides detailed information relating to CB2 interaction with G protein. Our findings, along with the published CB1 structures and CB2 inactive structures, fulfill the complete profile of cannabinoid system receptors and should aid in the rational design of drugs targeting CB2.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (PerkinElmer) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells (Novagen) were cultured in ESF 921 serum-free medium (Expression Systems) in 27°C. CHO-K1 cells overexpressing CB2 were used in radioligand-binding assays and cAMP functional assays. Sf9 cells were used exclusively for recombinant protein expression.
The full-length gene coding sequence of wild-type human CB2 was cloned into pFastBac vector (ThermoFisher) with an N-terminal FLAG tag followed by β2-AR N-terminal tail region (BN, hereafter) as fusion protein and a TEV cleavage site, along with a His8 tag at the C-terminal to facilitate expression and purification. The prolactin precursor sequence was inserted into the N terminus as a signaling peptide to anchor CB2 to the membrane and improve CB2 expression. A dominant-negative bovine Gαi1 (Gαi1_4M) construct was generated by site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate mutations S47N, G203A, E245A and A326S to decrease the affinity of nucleotide binding of Gαβγ complex ( Liang et al., 2018 36. Liang, Y.-L. ∙ Zhao, P. ∙ Draper-Joyce, C. ... Dominant negative G proteins enhance formation and purification of agonist-GPCR-G protein complexes for structure determination ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2018; 1 :12-20 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). All three G protein complex components, Gαi1_4M, rat Gβ1 and bovine Gγ2, were cloned into pFastBac vector separately. ScFv16 coding sequence was cloned into pFastBac vector (ThermoFisher) with a GP67 signaling peptide inserted into the N terminus and a TEV cleavage site-His8 at the C terminus.
Purification of scFv16 was conducted as previously described ( Koehl et al., 2018 30. Koehl, A. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Structure of the µ-opioid receptor–G i protein complex Nature. 2018; 558 :547-552 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a subtle change. Briefly, secreted scFv16 from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells (Novagen) was purified using Ni-NTA and size exclusion chromatography. After balancing the pH and removing the chelating agents by Ni 2+ and Ca 2+ , the cell culture supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA. The nickel resin was first washed with 20mM HEPES pH 7.2, 100mM NaCl, 50mM imidazole for 10 column volumes and then eluted in buffer containing 250mM imidazole. The eluted sample was treated with TEV protease (homemade) followed by dialysis in 20mM HEPES pH 7.2, 100mM NaCl overnight at 4°C and then reloaded onto Ni-NTA resin to remove cleaved octa-histidine tag. The flow-through was collected and applied to a HiLoad Superdex 200, 10/60 column (GE Healthcare). The monomeric peak fractions were concentrated and fast-frozen by liquid nitrogen.
CB2, Gαi1_4M, His8-tagged Gβ1 and Gγ2 were co-expressed in Sf9 insect cells (Novagen) using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Cell cultures were grown in ESF 921 serum-free medium (Expression Systems) at 27°C to a density of 4 × 10 6 cells mL -1 and then infected with the four types of baculoviruses expressing CB2, Gαi1_4M, His8-tagged Gβ1 and Gγ2 at the ratio of 1:1:1:1. After infection at 27°C for 48h, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm (ThermoFisher, H12000) for 20 min and kept frozen at −80°C for further usage.
For the purification of CB2-G i complex, cell pellets from 1.5L culture were thawed at room temperature and suspended by French press in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl 2 . Complex was formed on cell membrane in the presence of 2 μM WIN 55,212-2 (Tocris) and treated with apyrase (25 mU/ml, NEB), followed by incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature. Cell membranes were collected by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 35 min. The membranes were then re-suspended and solubilized in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 10% Glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM, Anatrace), 0.15% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate TRIS salt (CHS, Anatrace), 0.5% (w/v) 3‐[(3‐cholamido‐propyl)‐dimethylammonio]‐1‐propanesulfonate (CHAPS, Anatrace), 0.1%(w/v) digitonin (Sigma Aldrich), 2 μM WIN 55,212-2 and 25 mU mL -1 apyrase for 2.5 h at 4°C. The supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min and then incubated for 3h at 4°C with pre-equilibrated 5mL FLAG resin. After batch binding, the FLAG resin with immobilized protein complex was manually loaded onto a gravity column (Bio-Rad). The resin was first washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% DDM (w/v), 0.01% CHS (w/v), 0.05% CHAPS, 0.1% digitonin(w/v), 2 μM WIN 55,212-2. Detergent was then exchanged on resin by two washing steps in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 2 μM WIN 55,212-2 supplemented with different detergents: first 0.02% DDM (w/v), 0.004% CHS (w/v), 0.02% CHAPS, 0.1% digitonin, then 0.1% digitonin for 10 column volumes each. Subsequently, the FLAG resin with bound material was gently resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% digitonin, 2 μM WIN 55,212-2, treated with TEV protease and 2.5 mg scFv16 overnight at 4°C. Released protein from FLAG beads was collected next day, concentrated and then loaded onto a Superdex 200, 10/300 GL increase column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.075% digitonin, 2 μM WIN 55,212-2. The eluted fractions of monomeric complex were pooled and concentrated for cryo-EM grids preparation. The final yield of purified complex is approximately 1mg per liter of insect cell culture.
A droplet (3.0 μl) of the purified CB2-WIN 55,212-2-G i -scFv16 complex at a concentration of about 7.0 mg ml −1 was applied to a glow-discharged holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3, Au 300 mesh), and subsequently vitrified using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI Company). Cryo-EM movie stacks were collected on a Titan Krios microscope operated at 300 kV under EFTEM mode. Nanoprobe with 0.9 μm illumination area was used. Data were recorded on a post-GIF Gatan K2 summit camera at a nominal magnification of 130,000, using super-resolution counting model at physical pixel size of 1.029 Å. BioQuantum energy filter was operated in the zero-energy-loss mode with an energy slit width of 20 eV. The total accumulative electron dose is ∼83 e-/ Å 2 fractioned over 40 subframes with a total exposure time of 8 s. The target defocus range was set to −1.0 ∼-2.5 μm. A total of 8,810 image stacks were collected with two datasets.
The movie stacks were corrected for drift and beam-induced motion by MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 77. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) with 2 × binning, which generated drift-corrected summed images with and without electron-dose weighting. Each micrograph was manually inspected to remove bad pictures that were contaminated by crystalline ice or other forms of visible contamination, and CTF parameters were estimated by CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 58. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ) using non-dose-weighted images. After sorting, micrographs with maximum estimated resolution beyond 4.0 Å were discarded, and good motion-corrected summed images with dose-weighting were used for all other image processing in RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 78.

New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 54. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ). Global and local resolution estimates were calculated in RELION using the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC = 0.143) criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 59. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ). About 3.5K manually picked parties were used to generate the auto picking 2D reference. The two datasets were performed auto picking and particle extraction, separately in RELION3.0. Particles extracted from each sub-dataset were 4 times downscaled and subjected to reference-free 2D classification to remove false picks and obvious junk classes leaving behind approximately 341,033 particles from dataset1 and 627,252 particles from dataset2 ( Figure S2 ). The selected particles were re-centered and re-extracted for further 3-D processing. The initial model was generated in cryoSPARC ( Figure S2 ) with re-extracted particles from dataset1. The totally good 968,288 particles were 3-D classified with 8 classes in RELION3.0 with 60 Å low pass filter of the initial model. Two good classes (∼812k particles) were selected for another round of 3-D classification with CB2/G i /scFv16 mask. A final set of 772k homogeneous CB2/G i /scFv16 complex particles was selected to perform 3-D refinements in RELION3.0. The final model was refined to an overall resolution of 3.2 Å. The map was sharpened with a B-factor of −98 Å 2 ( Figure S3 ). Local resolution estimates were determined by ResMap software ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 32. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1314) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 ). The final set of homogeneous CB2/Gi/scFv16 complex particles were also subjected to AHD focused refinement to generate a better map for AHD domain ( Figure S3 ).
The initial G i protein and scFv16 model were adopted from the cryo-EM structure of μ-opioid receptor-G i Protein complex (PDB: 6DDE ), and initial CB2 model was generated by an online homology model building tool ( Kelley et al., 2015 28. Kelley, L.A. ∙ Mezulis, S. ∙ Yates, C.M. ... The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :845-858 Crossref Scopus (7220) PubMed Google Scholar ). All models were docked into the electron microscopy density map, followed by iterative manual adjustment and rebuilding in COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 12. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ), and real space refinement using Phenix programs ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model statistics were validated using Phenix Comprehensive validation ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural figures were prepared in Chimera and PyMOL ( https://pymol.org/2/ ). The final refinement statistics are provided in the Table S1 . The extent of any model overfitting during refinement was measured by refining the final model against one of the half-maps and by comparing the resulting map versus model FSC curves with the two half-maps and the full model.
A fluorescence detection assay was conducted using the thiol-specific fluorochrome N-[4-(7-diethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)-phenyl]-maleimide (CPM) to determine thermal stability of CB2-G i -scFv16 complex. The CPM reacts with the native cysteines embedded in the protein. CPM dye (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved at 4 mg/mL in DMSO as stock, and then diluted 1:40 with CPM dilution buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl. The protein (30–40 ng) was diluted in CPM dilution buffer supplemented with 0.1% digitonin to a final volume of 150 μL. 10 μL of the diluted dye was added and mixed together with protein sample gently. After incubation in ice for 10 min to allow fully equilibration of the reaction system, the mixture was transferred into a sub-micro quartz fluorimeter cuvette (Starna Cells, Inc.). The melting curve was recorded by heating the mixture from 20°C to 90°C with a ramp rate of 2°C/min in a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). The excitation wavelength was set at 387 nm and the emission wavelength was 463 nm. Data analysis was performed by Prism 7 (GraphPad), Tm were determined by fitting the curve to the Boltzmann sigmoidal equation.
3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzylamine (1972 mg, 10 mmol) was added slowly to a solution of 4-(diethylamino) benzaldehyde (1770 mg, 10 mmol) and methanol (20 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred and refluxed for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the solvent was removed by evaporation in vacuum to give the crude compound 1 , which was used in the next step without further purification.
The crude compound 1 was dissolved in methanol (20 mL), and NaBH 4 (570 mg, 15 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred continuously for 12 hours at room temperature. The reaction solution was poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with water and brine and then dried over Na 2 SO 4 . The residue was purified by flash chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether, 1:2) on silica gel to obtain the intermediate 2 used in the following steps.
XIE55 was prepared from the intermediate compound 2 (358 mg, 1.0 mmol) and ( E )-2-phenylethene-1- sulfonyl chloride (202 mg, 1.0 mmol).

XIE57 was prepared from the intermediate compound 2 (358 mg, 1.0 mmol) and thiophene-2-sulfonyl chloride (182 mg, 1.0 mmol). The residue was purified by flash chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether, 1:2) on silica gel to obtain final product XIE57 . Yellow solid (270 mg, yield: 54%). m.p 77-80°C; 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO- d 6) δ 8.03–8.02 (m, 1H), 7.76–7.75 (m, 1H), 7.28–7.25 (m, 1H), 6.96 (d, J = 8.40 Hz, 2H), 6.55 (d, J = 8.80 Hz, 2H), 6.28 (s, 2H), 4.20 (s, 2H), 4.17 (s, 2H), 3.61 (s, 6H), 3.60 (s, 3H), 3.30–3.26 (m, 4H), 1.06 (t, J = 11.20 Hz, 6H); 13 C NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 153.06, 147.44, 141.71, 137.18, 131.72, 131.57, 131.33, 130.27, 127.28, 121.26, 111.36, 105.50(2C), 60.84, 56.00, 50.84, 50.73, 44.30, 12.52; MS (ESI): m/z 505.28 (M + H) + .
Nonradioactive ligands were diluted in binding buffer and supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 0.4% methylcellulose. Each assay plate well contained a total of 200 μL of reaction mixture composed of 5 μg of CB2 membrane protein, labeled [ 3 H] CP-55,940 ligand at a final concentration of 3 nM, and the unlabeled ligand at variable dilutions, as stated above. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 1 h with gentle shaking. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through Unifilter GF/B filter plates using a Unifilter Cell Harvester (PerkinElmer). After the plate was allowed to dry overnight, 30 μL of MicroScint-0 cocktail (PerkinElmer) was added to each well and the radioactivity was counted using a PerkinElmer TopCounter. All assays were performed in duplicate and data points were represented as mean ± SEM. Bound radioactivity data was analyzed for Ki values using nonlinear regression analysis via GraphPad Prism 7 software.
Cellular cAMP levels were measured according to the reported method with modifications using LANCE cAMP 384 kits (PerkinElmer) ( Zhang et al., 2011; Ouyang et al., 2013 51. Ouyang, Q. ∙ Tong, Q. ∙ Feng, R. ... Trisubstituted Sulfonamides: a New Chemotype for Development of Potent and Selective CB2 Receptor Inverse Agonists ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2013; 4 :387-392 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar 75. Zhang, Y. ∙ Xie, Z. ∙ Wang, L. ... Mutagenesis and computer modeling studies of a GPCR conserved residue W5.43(194) in ligand recognition and signal transduction for CB2 receptor Int. Immunopharmacol. 2011; 11 :1303-1310 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The assay is based on competition between a Europium-labeled cAMP trace complex and total cAMP for binding sites on cAMP-specific antibodies labeled with a fluorescent dye. CB 2 receptor wild-type (WT)-transfected CHO cells were seeded into a 384-well white ProxiPlates with a density of 2000 cells per well in 5 μL of RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% dialyzed FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 100 μg/mL penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin and 200 μg/mL of G-418. After culture overnight, 2.5 μL of cAMP antibody and RO20-1724 (final concentration, 50 μM) in stimulation buffer (DPBS 1x, containing 0.1% BSA) was added to each well, followed by addition of either 2.5 μL compound or forskolin (final 5 μM) for agonist-inhibited adenylate cyclase (AC) activity assay. After incubation at room temperature for 45 min, 10 μL of detection reagent was added into each well. The plate was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature and measured in Synergy H1 hybrid reader (BioTek) with excitation at 340 nm and emission at 665 nm. Each cAMP determination was made via at least three independent experiments, each in triplicate. EC 50 values were determined by nonlinear regression, dose-response curves (GraphPad Prism 7).
Ligand binding always involves its interaction with key binding residues, the changes in the features of ligand binding site, particular rearrangements of the protein structure, etc. Thus, several key aspects of ligand binding can be explored quantitatively in a special binding region of a crystal/Cryo-EM structure, including the involved key residues, residual energy contribution, energy term, etc. Starting with the code base of the current stable version 2.2.3 of idock ( Li et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2019 8. Chen, M. ∙ Jing, Y. ∙ Wang, L. ... DAKB-GPCRs: An Integrated Computational Platform for Drug Abuse Related GPCRs J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2019; 59 :1283-1289 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar 35.

Trott, O. ∙ Olson, A.J. AutoDock Vina: improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization, and multithreading J. Comput. Chem. 2010; 31 :455-461 Crossref Scopus (7925) PubMed Google Scholar ), we developed an even more efficient variant integrating the ability to calculate also the residual contributions of the binding energy. Our adaptation skips the CPU-intensive precalculation of free energy grid map in the case of crystal/Cryo-EM structures with a ligand bound because the need for testing a massive number of conformational candidates is no longer there. Thereafter, the program populates the precisely calculated per-atom-pair free energy for every residue and produces the results. The improvement could reduce total time consumption by 95%∼97% for most input. We will discuss this method in depth in our future publications.
The docking program Surflex-Dock GeomX (SFXC) in SYBYL-X 2.0 was applied to construct receptor-ligand complexes in which the docking scores were expressed in -log10 (Kd). The main protocols or parameters of docking were addressed in our previous publications ( Feng et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2015 13. Feng, Z. ∙ Alqarni, M.H. ∙ Yang, P. ... Modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and mutation validation for structure of cannabinoid receptor 2 based on known crystal structures of GPCRs J. Chem. Inf.

Model. 2015; 55 :572-588 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the docking parameters used were as follows: (a) the “number of starting conformations per ligand” was set to 10, and the “number of max conformations per fragment” was set to 20; (b) the “maximum number of rotatable bonds per molecule” was set to 100; (c) flags were turned on at “pre-dock minimization,” “post-dock minimization,” “molecule fragmentation,” and “soft grid treatment”; (d) “activate spin alignment method with density of search” was set to 9.0; and (e) the “number of spins per alignment” was set to 12.
The MD simulation system consists of one copy of human CB2 transmembrane domain and the WIN 55212-2 ligand, 240 POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) lipids, 0.15 M NaCl, and 17082 TIP3P ( Jorgensen et al., 1983 26. Jorgensen, W.L. ∙ Chandrasekhar, J. ∙ Madura, J.D. ... Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79 :926 Crossref Scopus (33497) Google Scholar ) water molecules. The lipids, ions and water molecules were added using CHARMM-GUI. The detailed force field set up and MD protocol can be found elsewhere ( Yin et al., 2018 74. Yin, J. ∙ Chapman, K. ∙ Clark, L.D. ... Crystal structure of the human NK 1 tachykinin receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :13264-13269 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, protein, lipid and the ligand are described by AMBER FF14SB ( Maier et al., 2015 40. Maier, J.A. ∙ Martinez, C. ∙ Kasavajhala, K. ... ff14SB: Improving the Accuracy of Protein Side Chain and Backbone Parameters from ff99SB J. Chem.

Chem. 2004; 25 :1157-1174 Crossref Scopus (14096) PubMed Google Scholar ) force fields, respectively.
MD simulation was performed using the AMBER18 software package ( Case et al., 2018 6. Case, D.A. ∙ Ben-Shalom, I.Y. ∙ Brozell, S.R. ... AMBER 2018 University of California, San Francisco, 2018 Google Scholar ). The MD system was first relaxed by a set of minimizations by removing possible steric clashes. There were three phases for the subsequent NPT (constant particle number, pressure and temperature) MD simulations: the relaxation phase (1 ns for each temperature from 50 to 250 K at a step of 50 K), the equilibrium phase (25 ns, 298 K), and the sampling phase (200 ns). 2000 snapshots were evenly selected from the sampling phase for MM-GBSA binding free energy decomposition analysis. Integration of the equations of motion was conducted at a time step of 1 fs for the relaxation phase and 2 fs for the equilibrium and sampling phases.
For each MD snapshot, the molecular mechanical (MM) energy (E MM ) and the MM-GB/SA solvation free energy were calculated without further minimization ( Wang et al., 2006; Hou et al., 2011a, 2011b 20.

Recent Advances in Free Energy Calculations with a Combination of Molecular Mechanics and Continuum Models Curr. Computer-Aided Drug Des. 2006; 2 :287-306 Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar ). The interaction energies between each residue and the ligand were calculated with the solvent effect being taken into account using a MM-GBSA solvation model developed previously ( Hawkins et al., 1996 19. Hawkins, G.D. ∙ Cramer, C.J. ∙ Truhlar, D.G. Parametrized models of aqueous free energies of solvation based on pairwise descreening of solute atomic charges from a dielectric medium J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100 :19824-19839 Crossref Scopus (821) Google Scholar ). Key parameters controlling the MM-GBSA analyses were the following: external dielectric constant ∼80; internal dielectric constant ∼1; and the surface tension for estimating the nonpolar solvation energy ∼0.005.
Structural figures were prepared in UCSF Chimera ( https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/ ) and PyMOL ( https://pymol.org/2/ ).
All reported resolutions in cryo-EM studies are based upon the 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation criterion. Error bars in Figure 4 B represent standard error of the mean for three independent experiments.
