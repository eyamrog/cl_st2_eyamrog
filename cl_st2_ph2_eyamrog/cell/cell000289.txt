Title: Spliceosome-targeted therapies trigger an antiviral immune response in triple-negative breast cancer


Abstract: Summary

Many oncogenic insults deregulate RNA splicing, often leading to hypersensitivity of tumors to spliceosome-targeted therapies (STTs). However, the mechanisms by which STTs selectively kill cancers remain largely unknown. Herein, we discover that mis-spliced RNA itself is a molecular trigger for tumor killing through viral mimicry. In MYC-driven triple-negative breast cancer, STTs cause widespread cytoplasmic accumulation of mis-spliced mRNAs, many of which form double-stranded structures. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding proteins recognize these endogenous dsRNAs, triggering antiviral signaling and extrinsic apoptosis. In immune-competent models of breast cancer, STTs cause tumor cell-intrinsic antiviral signaling, downstream adaptive immune signaling, and tumor cell death. Furthermore, RNA mis-splicing in human breast cancers correlates with innate and adaptive immune signatures, especially in MYC-amplified tumors that are typically immune cold. These findings indicate that dsRNA-sensing pathways respond to global aberrations of RNA splicing in cancer and provoke the hypothesis that STTs may provide unexplored strategies to activate anti-tumor immune pathways.

Section: Introduction

Tumor transcriptomes are replete with indications of deregulated RNA splicing, such as aberrant retention of introns and alterations in both canonical and alternative splicing ( Venables, 2004 120.

Non-spliceosome-associated oncogenic alterations, such as hyperactivation of the transcription factor MYC, have also been shown to broadly deregulate splicing and lead to increased reliance on components of pre-mRNA splicing ( David et al., 2010 24.

Small-molecule splicing modulators have been explored as anti-cancer therapeutics for over 20 years ( Nakajima et al., 1996 84. Nakajima, H. ∙ Hori, Y. ∙ Terano, H. ...

Spliceostatin A targets SF3b and inhibits both splicing and nuclear retention of pre-mRNA Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3 :576-583 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ), but their downstream mechanisms of selective anti-tumor activity are not well understood. While spliceosome modulators are known to induce transcriptome-wide mis-splicing, previous work has focused on mis-splicing of specific genes to explain tumor cell death and other phenotypes associated with splicing perturbation. For instance, cell-cycle arrest phenotypes have been attributed to mis-splicing of genes encoding cell-cycle regulators such as p27 ( Kaida et al., 2007 49.

Genome-wide RNAi screens in human brain tumor isolates reveal a novel viability requirement for PHF5A Genes Dev. 2013; 27 :1032-1045 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, alternative splicing of BCL2 family genes is thought to induce activation of apoptosis in some contexts ( Aird et al., 2019 1. Aird, D. ∙ Teng, T. ∙ Huang, C.-L. ...

An alternative splicing network links cell-cycle control to apoptosis Cell. 2010; 142 :625-636 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). These important studies highlight the impact of individual mis-spliced mRNAs and their encoded proteins but also emphasize that culprit mis-spliced genes may vary widely across individual tumors and their diverse transcriptomes. This leaves open the question of whether there are more generalized pathways that govern tumor cell response to spliceosome-targeted therapies (STTs), especially in tumor types that exhibit heightened dependency on RNA splicing.
The current study reveals that mis-spliced mRNAs themselves are a class of macromolecules that are sensed upon spliceosome inhibition, triggering an antiviral immune response and TNBC cell death. We show that STTs cause widespread accumulation of intron-containing transcripts and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cytoplasm of TNBC cells. These endogenous intron-containing dsRNAs trigger an antiviral immune response via multiple dsRNA binding proteins, including those that activate the signaling integrator MAVS. Notably, STTs trigger both tumor cell-intrinsic antiviral signaling and adaptive immune signaling in animal models of breast cancer. Moreover, intrinsic defects in RNA splicing in primary human breast malignancies correlate with evidence of immune engagement and associate with improved disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. These findings point to dysregulated splicing as an unanticipated approach by which to trigger tumor-intrinsic dsRNA antiviral signaling and provide mechanistic insight to explain, in part, the selective anti-cancer activity of STTs.

Section: Results

Previous studies have demonstrated that MYC-driven cancers such as TNBC are sensitive to partial pharmacologic and genetic perturbation of the spliceosome ( Hsu et al., 2015 43. Hsu, T.Y.-T. ∙ Simon, L.M. ∙ Neill, N.J. ... The spliceosome is a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC-driven cancer Nature. 2015; 525 :384-388 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koh et al., 2015 58.

MYC regulates the core pre-mRNA splicing machinery as an essential step in lymphomagenesis Nature. 2015; 523 :96-100 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the pathways that are activated by and coordinate cell-fate decision making in response to spliceosome inhibition are largely unknown. We integrated two unbiased approaches—gene-expression analysis and forward genetic screening—to investigate these pathways. First, we characterized the transcriptional changes of two MYC-driven TNBC cell lines, SUM159 and MDA-MB-231-LM2 (LM2) ( Kessler et al., 2012 53. Kessler, J.D. ∙ Kahle, K.T. ∙ Sun, T. ...

Hsu, T.Y.-T. ∙ Simon, L.M. ∙ Neill, N.J. ... The spliceosome is a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC-driven cancer Nature. 2015; 525 :384-388 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ), following treatment with the small-molecule spliceosome modulator sudemycin D6 (SD6) ( Lagisetti et al., 2013 60. Lagisetti, C. ∙ Palacios, G. ∙ Goronga, T. ... Optimization of antitumor modulators of pre-mRNA splicing J. Med. Chem. 2013; 56 :10033-10044 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 110. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (17346) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed that transcriptional changes in response to spliceosome inhibition were highly correlated between the two cell lines ( Figure 1 B), suggesting that a common set of cellular pathways may respond to acute splicing perturbation. Consistent with previous reports, cell-cycle and RNA-processing pathways were downregulated in response to spliceosome inhibition ( Hsu et al., 2015 43. Hsu, T.Y.-T. ∙ Simon, L.M. ∙ Neill, N.J. ... The spliceosome is a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC-driven cancer Nature. 2015; 525 :384-388 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hubert et al., 2013 44.

Genome-wide RNAi screens in human brain tumor isolates reveal a novel viability requirement for PHF5A Genes Dev. 2013; 27 :1032-1045 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Seiler et al., 2018b 100. Seiler, M. ∙ Yoshimi, A. ∙ Darman, R. ... H3B-8800, an orally available small-molecule splicing modulator, induces lethality in spliceosome-mutant cancers Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :497-504 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, immune signaling pathways, including interferon (IFN) alpha and beta signaling, were among the most significant positively enriched pathways ( Figure 1 C). Upregulation of both IFN-stimulated genes (e.g., OAS1, MX1 ) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-responsive genes (e.g., TNF , IL1B ) indicate activation of an antiviral transcriptional program in response to spliceosome inhibition ( Figure 1 D). Induction of IFNB expression preceded the expression of well-characterized IFN-responsive genes, suggesting activation of IFN-responsive antiviral signaling ( Figure S1 A). These results are not unique to SD6, as treatment of SUM159 and LM2 cells with H3B-8800 ( Seiler et al., 2018b 100. Seiler, M. ∙ Yoshimi, A. ∙ Darman, R. ... H3B-8800, an orally available small-molecule splicing modulator, induces lethality in spliceosome-mutant cancers Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :497-504 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ), a structurally distinct spliceosome modulator currently in clinical trials (NCT02841540), resulted in similar upregulation of an antiviral transcriptional program of mRNAs ( Figure 1 E; Figures S1 B and S1C) and secretion of their encoded proteins ( Figure 1 F). Together, these data support the model that inhibition of splicing induces an antiviral immune transcriptional response.
Notably, H3B-8800 induced antiviral transcriptional programs in MYC-driven TNBC cells to a much greater extent than non-transformed mammary epithelial cells ( Figure 1 E). Given that MYC hyperactivation has been shown to increase sensitivity to spliceosome inhibition, we asked whether MYC hyperactivation alone is sufficient to prime activation of such antiviral programs upon spliceosome inhibition using human mammary epithelial cells engineered with inducible MYC-ER transgene (MYC-ER HME1) ( Hsu et al., 2015 43. Hsu, T.Y.-T. ∙ Simon, L.M. ∙ Neill, N.J. ... The spliceosome is a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC-driven cancer Nature. 2015; 525 :384-388 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kessler et al., 2012 53. Kessler, J.D. ∙ Kahle, K.T. ∙ Sun, T. ... A SUMOylation-Dependent Transcriptional Subprogram Is Required for Myc-Driven Tumorigenesis Science. 2012; 335 :348-353 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, the combination of MYC hyperactivation and H3B-8800 treatment induced robust activation of antiviral signaling programs ( Figures 1 G and 1H), but the individual perturbations did not, strongly suggesting that oncogenic MYC can prime antiviral immune response to spliceosome inhibition.
To confirm that activation of antiviral transcriptional signaling was due to on-target inhibition of spliceosome activity, we evaluated the effects of chemical-genetic depletion of SF3B1, the protein target of SD6 and H3B-8800. Expression of SF3B1-FKBP12 F36V in SUM159 cells with knockout of endogenous SF3B1 enabled selective and dose-dependent perturbation of SF3B1 function ( Figure S1 D; Nabet et al., 2018 83. Nabet, B. ∙ Roberts, J.M. ∙ Buckley, D.L. ... The dTAG system for immediate and target-specific protein degradation Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14 :431-441 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to treatment with STTs, degradation of SF3B1-FKBP12 F36V induced expression of IFN and NF-κB-responsive genes ( Figures 1 I and 1J). From these data, we conclude that spliceosome perturbation induces an antiviral transcriptional response in MYC-driven TNBCs.
Second, we sought to identify genes required for sensitivity to spliceosome inhibition in TNBC cells. We performed a forward genetic screen with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library (18,370 shRNAs targeting 1,837 genes) targeting signal transducing protein classes (kinases, phosphatases, and ubiquitin ligases). SUM159 cells transduced with the retroviral shRNA library were grown in the presence or absence of SD6 ( Figure 2 A). The shRNA abundance in tumor cell genomic DNA was quantified in initial and treated samples by sequencing. We focused our downstream analysis on shRNAs that increased in abundance specifically in the SD6-treated state, referred to as “resistance candidates” because candidate knockdown conferred resistance to spliceosome inhibition ( Table S1 ). MeSH term enrichment analysis ( Yu, 2018 130. Yu, G. Using meshes for MeSH term enrichment and semantic analyses Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :3766-3767 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) of the top 50 resistance candidates revealed a cluster of genes involved in immune response ( Figure 2 B; Table S2 ), suggesting that immune pathways may regulate tumor cell response to spliceosome-targeted therapies (STTs). StringDB analysis of resistance candidates revealed enrichment of pathways related to immunity and regulation of signaling downstream of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing ( Figure S2 A). Notably, 5 of the top 30 resistance candidates were documented modulators of dsRNA-sensing pathways ( Figure S2 B) ( Arimoto et al., 2007 4. Arimoto, K. ∙ Takahashi, H. ∙ Hishiki, T. ...

USP1-UAF1 deubiquitinase complex stabilizes TBK1 and enhances antiviral responses J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :3553-3563 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). shRNAs targeting these modulators were consistently enriched upon partial spliceosome inhibition ( Figure 2 C; Figures S2 C and S2D). These data suggest that activation of dsRNA-sensing and signaling pathways contributes to sensitivity to spliceosome inhibition. Indeed, independent competition-based assays validated that depletion of RNF128 , RNF125 , and UBE2D1 increased resistance to spliceosome inhibition ( Figure 2 D; Figures S2 E–S2G). As these genes have been shown to mediate activation of antiviral transcriptional programs, we tested whether their depletion would suppress antiviral immune transcriptional activation induced by spliceosome inhibition. Knockout of RNF128 suppressed induction of immune signaling transcriptional changes upon treatment with SD6 ( Figure 2 E). Collectively, these unbiased transcriptomic and genetic approaches suggest that partial inhibition of the spliceosome induces antiviral signaling in tumor cells and that these pathways regulate tumor cell survival in response to STTs.
We next investigated the trigger of antiviral signaling in response to spliceosome inhibition. Our genetic screen indicated that dsRNA antiviral signaling pathways modulate cancer cell response to STTs, suggesting that spliceosome perturbation may lead to accumulation of dsRNA. Immunofluorescence staining using a dsRNA-specific antibody (J2 antibody) ( Schönborn et al., 1991 97. Schönborn, J. ∙ Oberstrass, J. ∙ Breyel, E. ... Monoclonal antibodies to double-stranded RNA as probes of RNA structure in crude nucleic acid extracts Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 :2993-3000 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) across multiple TNBC lines revealed that H3B-8800 induced significant increases in cytoplasmic dsRNA ( Figures 3 A–3D; Figures S3 A and S3B). The J2 signal was abolished by dsRNA-specific RNase III treatment, indicating that the J2 antibody specifically recognized accumulation of dsRNA structures ( Figures 3 A–3D). In contrast to these MYC-driven TNBC models, non-transformed HME1 cells did not exhibit increased J2 signal at the same dose of H3B-8800 ( Figure S3 C). Notably, in the MYC-ER HME1 system, the combination of MYC hyperactivation and H3B-8800 led to a significant increase in dsRNA accumulation compared to MYC or H3B-8800 alone ( Figure 3 E), indicating that MYC is sufficient to prime accumulation of dsRNAs in response to spliceosome inhibition. Importantly, in both the TNBC and MYC-ER HME1 experimental systems, dsRNA accumulated prominently in the cytoplasm (representative images in Figures 3 A, 3C, and 3E; Figures S3 A and S3B), where dsRNA-sensing proteins have been shown to engage dsRNA viruses and other dsRNA species.
Next, we established that direct perturbation of the spliceosome induced dsRNA accumulation. Degradation of exogenous SF3B1-FKBP12 F36V in an endogenous SF3B1 knockout background resulted in accumulation of cytoplasmic dsRNA ( Figure 3 F), phenocopying the effect of H3B-8800. To further confirm the SF3B1-on-target effect of H3B-8800 as the source of dsRNA accumulation, we utilized exogenously expressed SF3B1 R1074H ( Figures S3 D and S3G), which confers resistance to small molecules targeting SF3B1 ( Seiler et al., 2018b 100.

SF3B1 R1074H expression suppressed H3B-8800-induced intron retention ( Figure S3 F) and increase in J2 signal ( Figure 3 G; Figure S3 I). These results indicate that spliceosome inhibition leads to widespread accumulation of cytoplasmic dsRNA in MYC-driven TNBC cells. Together with activation of antiviral signaling by spliceosome inhibition ( Figures 1 and 2 ), these observations support the model that STTs exert a therapeutic effect, at least in part, via dsRNA sensing and downstream antiviral signaling.
We then sought to investigate the source of cytoplasmic dsRNA in response to acute spliceosome inhibition. Spliceosome perturbations induce transcriptome-wide defects in splicing, including intron retention, but the extent to which these intron-retained transcripts are exported and accumulate in the cytoplasm is unclear. Some intron-containing gene isoforms have well-characterized biological functions in the cytoplasm ( Buckley et al., 2014 13. Buckley, P.T. ∙ Khaladkar, M. ∙ Kim, J. ... Cytoplasmic intron retention, function, splicing, and the sentinel RNA hypothesis Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2014; 5 :223-230 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), and certain cancer-associated neoepitopes are derived from intron-retained RNA ( Smart et al., 2018 106.

However, the majority of intron-retained RNAs are predicted to be degraded by quality-control mechanisms ( Braunschweig et al., 2014 12. Braunschweig, U. ∙ Barbosa-Morais, N.L. ∙ Pan, Q. ...

Zhang, J. ∙ Manley, J.L. Misregulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing in cancer Cancer Discov. 2013; 3 :1228-1237 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, we found that acute spliceosome perturbation led to widespread accumulation of intron-retained transcripts in the cytoplasm of TNBC cells. Poly(A) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of cytoplasmic fraction RNA of SUM159 cells treated with H3B-8800 ( Figure S4 A) revealed a significant increase in intron retention (IR) across 24,883 introns ( Figure 4 A; Figure S4 B). Investigation of individual RNA localization using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a significant increase in intron-containing RNA in the cytoplasm after H3B-8800 treatment ( Figures 4 B and 4C; Figures S4 C–S4F). Importantly, overlapping intronic and exonic foci indicates these cytoplasmic introns are present in the context of unspliced transcripts, as opposed to intron lariats or off-target probe recognition. Based on these results, we conclude that acute spliceosome inhibition induces global accumulation of mis-spliced, intron-containing RNA in the cytoplasm.
Given that spliceosome inhibition induced substantial accumulation of cytoplasmic intron-retained RNAs and dsRNA, we hypothesized that intron-retained mRNAs were a source of cytoplasmic dsRNA. Previous studies have shown that introns form double-stranded structures in the nucleus ( Saldi et al., 2014 94. Saldi, T.K. ∙ Ash, P.E. ∙ Wilson, G. ... TDP-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of TDP-43, limits the accumulation of double-stranded RNA EMBO J. 2014; 33 :2947-2966 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sun et al., 2019 112. Sun, L. ∙ Fazal, F.M. ∙ Li, P. ... RNA structure maps across mammalian cellular compartments Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :322-330 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that a large proportion of retrotransposable elements (e.g., LINE, SINE/Alus) in the genome are located in introns ( Sela et al., 2007 101. Sela, N. ∙ Mersch, B. ∙ Gal-Mark, N. ... Comparative analysis of transposed element insertion within human and mouse genomes reveals Alu’s unique role in shaping the human transcriptome Genome Biol. 2007; 8 :R127 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, there was a significant increase in expression of over 9,000 intron-residing retrotransposons, including LINE and SINE/Alu elements, after H3B-8800 treatment ( Figure 4 D; Figure S4 G). In contrast, expression of retrotransposons residing outside of intronic regions did not substantively change ( Figure 4 E; Figure S4 H). Therefore, in contrast to primarily intergenic endogenous retroviral elements induced by DNA demethylating agents ( Chiappinelli et al., 2015 18. Chiappinelli, K.B. ∙ Strissel, P.L. ∙ Desrichard, A. ...

DNA-Demethylating Agents Target Colorectal Cancer Cells by Inducing Viral Mimicry by Endogenous Transcripts Cell. 2015; 162 :961-973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (472) PubMed Google Scholar ), we conclude that acute perturbation of splicing reveals a previously unexplored class of endogenous double-stranded RNAs that may serve as triggers of an antiviral response.
To directly assess the composition of dsRNAs that accumulate after spliceosome inhibition, we performed dsRNA immunoprecipitation using the J2 antibody followed by poly(A) RNA-seq (J2 dsRIP-seq). Introns retained after spliceosome inhibition were significantly enriched by J2 dsRIP-seq ( Figures 4 F and 4G), suggesting pervasive formation of double-stranded secondary structure. Among those genes with highly J2-enriched retained introns was RPL30 ( Figure 4 H), which contains inverted Alu elements that contribute to a long stretch of predicted dsRNA structure ( Figure S4 I). Interestingly, introns without retrotransposons were also enriched by J2 and predicted to form lengthy, continuous double-stranded structures ( Figures S4 J and S4K), suggesting that introns broadly contribute to accumulation of dsRNA. Probing of RNA structure using single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) digestion followed by qRT-PCR revealed J2-enriched introns were enriched 10- to 15-fold for dsRNA structure ( Figure 4 I), supporting their contribution to the pool of dsRNA following spliceosome inhibition. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that spliceosome inhibition causes accumulation of intron-retained RNAs, which form double-stranded structures that accumulate in the cytoplasm.
Our data thus far indicate that STTs cause cytoplasmic accumulation of dsRNA in MYC-driven TNBC. Recognition of cytoplasmic dsRNA has been shown to activate an antiviral transcriptional response and, in some contexts, induce extrinsic apoptosis ( Kibler et al., 1997 54.

However, previous work has suggested that STTs induce apoptosis through alternative splicing of BCL2 family genes ( Larrayoz et al., 2016 62. Larrayoz, M. ∙ Blakemore, S.J. ∙ Dobson, R.C. ...

An alternative splicing network links cell-cycle control to apoptosis Cell. 2010; 142 :625-636 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ), which mediate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway ( Elmore, 2007 33. Elmore, S. Apoptosis: a review of programmed cell death Toxicol. Pathol. 2007; 35 :495-516 Crossref Scopus (6310) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we sought to determine whether extrinsic or intrinsic pathways drive apoptosis in response to STTs. Consistent with prior studies, both H3B-8800 and SD6 activated downstream effector caspases-3 and -7 ( Figure 5 A; Figure S5 A). Notably, both STTs activated caspase-8 ( Figure 5 B; Figure S5 B), an initiator caspase of extrinsic apoptosis. Likewise, in MYC-ER HME1 cells, the combination of MYC hyperactivation and H3B-8800 led to robust induction of both caspases-3 and -7 and caspase-8 activity ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Additionally, expression of SF3B1 R1074H suppressed activation of both caspase-8 and caspases-3 and -7, suggesting that apoptotic cell death is indeed due to on-target spliceosome inhibition ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Caspase-8 cleavage occurred within 12 h, preceding caspase-3 cleavage ( Figure 5 C). Strikingly, inhibition of both caspase-8 and -10, initiators of extrinsic apoptosis, suppressed activation of downstream effector caspases by H3B-8800 and SD6 ( Figure 5 D; Figure S5 G). In contrast, inhibition of caspase-9, an initiator of intrinsic apoptosis, did not significantly suppress caspase-3 and -7 activation ( Figure S5 G), suggesting intrinsic mechanisms do not play a primary role in activation of apoptosis, at least in the context of TNBC. Additionally, necroptosis is not a primary pathway of cell death as inhibition of RIPK3 did not impede H3B-8800-induced cell death ( Figures S5 H–S5J). Together, these results indicate that the induction of apoptosis by spliceosome inhibition occurs through extrinsic mechanisms in breast cancer.
Extrinsic apoptosis can be activated through mechanisms that are dependent on cell-surface death receptors. We observed that after H3B-8800, death-receptor-related ligands and receptors were not substantially upregulated ( Figures S5 K–S5N). Additionally, cFLIP splicing and isoform expression were not changed ( Figures S5 O and S5P). Knockdown of TNFR1 did not significantly suppress induction of apoptosis ( Figures S5 Q–S5S). These data suggest that extrinsic apoptosis is activated in a death-receptor-independent manner.
Prior studies have shown that recognition of cytoplasmic dsRNA can trigger death-receptor-independent extrinsic apoptosis ( Gil and Esteban, 2000 35. Gil, J. ∙ Esteban, M. Induction of apoptosis by the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR): mechanism of action Apoptosis. 2000; 5 :107-114 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ; El Maadidi et al., 2014 31.

Immunol. 2014; 192 :1171-1183 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our genetic screen ( Figure 2 ) implicated the RIG-I-like Receptor (RLR) dsRNA-sensing pathway in sensitivity to STTs, suggesting that spliceosome inhibition activates extrinsic apoptosis via dsRNA binding proteins, including RLRs.

To systematically test their role in H3B-8800-induced extrinsic apoptosis, we depleted individual dsRNA binding proteins, including RLRs, using multiple independent small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) ( Figure S5 T) and tested STT-induced extrinsic apoptosis. Depletion of several dsRNA binding proteins partially suppressed activity of caspase-8 and downstream activation of apoptosis upon H3B-8800 treatment ( Figures 5 E and 5F), while knockdown of others had no effect, suggesting there may be selectivity of dsRNA sensors that recognize endogenous dsRNA accumulation and stimulate apoptosis. The observation that RIG-I and MDA5, which recognize distinct pools of dsRNA ( Hornung et al., 2006 41.

Collectively, these results indicate that recognition of dsRNAs induced by STTs contributes to downstream activation of apoptosis. However, the observed partial suppression of extrinsic apoptosis suggests there may be redundancy in dsRNA-recognition pathways or that other pathways contribute to apoptosis.
Several of these dsRNA sensors (MDA5, RIG-I, DHX9, and DHX33) converge on activation of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) to induce two independent arms of downstream antiviral signal transduction: transcriptional changes and induction of apoptosis ( Kawai et al., 2005 52.

DHX9 pairs with IPS-1 to sense double-stranded RNA in myeloid dendritic cells J. Immunol. 2011; 187 :4501-4508 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that spliceosome inhibition activates the signaling integrator MAVS, resulting in initiation of an antiviral response. Activation of MAVS results in its aggregation on the mitochondrial membrane ( Hou et al., 2011 42. Hou, F. ∙ Sun, L. ∙ Zheng, H. ... MAVS forms functional prion-like aggregates to activate and propagate antiviral innate immune response Cell. 2011; 146 :448-461 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (670) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, H3B-8800 induced aggregation of MAVS in both SUM159 and LM2 cells, as assessed by immunofluorescence imaging ( Figures 5 G and 5H; Figures S5 U and S5V) and SDD-AGE followed by immunoblotting ( Figures 5 I and S5 W). Knockdown of MAVS partially suppressed extrinsic apoptosis ( Figures 5 J and 5K; Figure S5 X). The observed partial suppression of extrinsic apoptosis suggests there may be additional pathways that initiate extrinsic apoptosis. Consistent with this, the dsRNA sensors DHX36, DDX21, and DDX1 are partially required for H3B-8800-induced extrinsic apoptosis but have not, to our knowledge, been characterized to signal through MAVS. Finally, knockout of MAVS impaired antiviral transcriptional changes upon H3B-8800 treatment ( Figure 5 L; Figures S5 Y and S5Z). Taken together, these data support the model that STTs induce accumulation of dsRNA and consequently activate dsRNA-sensing pathways (likely MAVS-dependent and -independent), leading to upregulation of an antiviral transcriptional program and activation of extrinsic apoptosis.
Antiviral signaling through dsRNA pathways induces tumor cell death through a variety of mechanisms, including cell-autonomous apoptosis ( Der et al., 1997 27. Der, S.D. ∙ Yang, Y.-L. ∙ Weissmann, C. ... A double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway mediating stress-induced apoptosis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Loss of ADAR1 in tumours overcomes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade Nature. 2019; 565 :43-48 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). While STTs trigger tumor cell death in a cell-autonomous manner ( Figure 5 ), robust induction of antiviral transcriptional programs by STTs prompts the hypothesis that such antiviral signaling may also serve as a beacon for downstream host immune surveillance. Therefore, we assessed the impact of spliceosome inhibition on TNBC in an immune-competent host using multiple transplantable syngeneic murine tumor models (2208L, PyMT-M, AT3, and T11). Consistent with prior work ( Seiler et al., 2018b 100. Seiler, M. ∙ Yoshimi, A. ∙ Darman, R. ... H3B-8800, an orally available small-molecule splicing modulator, induces lethality in spliceosome-mutant cancers Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :497-504 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ), H3B-8800 treatment was well tolerated. Notably, the effect of spliceosome perturbation on tumor progression varied significantly across these models. H3B-8800 significantly impaired tumor progression in 2208L and PyMT-M tumor models (“sensitive” models), while only modestly delaying tumor growth in AT3 and T11 models (“resistant” models) ( Figure 6 A), indicating H3B-8800 is differentially efficacious as a single agent across TNBC models.
To investigate the mechanisms contributing to this differential sensitivity, we performed bulk tumor RNA sequencing. Splicing analysis showed that H3B-8800 induced widespread IR across all models. Notably, H3B-8800 induced a significantly greater increase in global IR in sensitive tumor models ( Figure 6 B) compared to resistant tumor models. The underlying causes of the increased global intron retention in sensitive models are currently unknown but could be a consequence of multiple mechanisms including partial defects in spliceosome function (e.g., somatic spliceosome mutations ( Lee et al., 2016 63.

Nonetheless, this observation indicates that elevated levels of intron-retained mRNA correlates with efficacy of spliceosome-targeted therapy in these immune-competent models of TNBC.
To further study the underlying causes for differential sensitivity, we queried the differential effects of H3B-8800 on transcriptional programs in sensitive versus resistant models using a DESeq2 multifactor model ( Love et al., 2014 73. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (14911) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by enrichment analysis. Pathways upregulated in sensitive models were almost exclusively immune-related pathways, in particular, those related to antiviral signaling, cytokine and chemokine signaling, and adaptive immunity ( Figures S6 A and S6B). H3B-8800 significantly upregulated expression of antiviral signaling genes in sensitive models, which had greater induction of IR but not in resistant models ( Figure 6 C). As an orthogonal approach, we performed GSEA on genes differentially expressed in H3B-8800-treated compared to vehicle-treated tumors. Hierarchical clustering of pathways commonly enriched among models revealed a pronounced cluster comprised almost exclusively of antiviral and adaptive immune pathways enriched solely in sensitive tumor models ( Figure 6 D; Table S3 ). These findings provide evidence that STTs activate not only tumor antiviral signaling but also adaptive immune signaling in models sensitive to this single-agent regimen. Furthermore, these pathways are negatively enriched in resistant tumor models, supporting the hypothesis that activation of antiviral immune signaling is crucial for the anti-tumor activity of STTs.
The observation that H3B-8800 induced strong antiviral transcriptional patterns specifically in sensitive tumor models supports the hypothesis that the STT-induced dsRNA-antiviral response observed in human TNBC models ( Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) also occurs in these sensitive murine TNBC cells. To confirm that gene-expression changes in non-tumor cells did not confound our analysis, we derived in vitro cell lines from these syngeneic models to investigate the tumor cell-intrinsic response to STT. While H3B-8800 induced IR across all models in vitro , H3B-8800 induced more IR in the 2208L and PyMT-M cell lines (from sensitive tumor models) than in AT3 and T11 cell lines (from resistant tumor models) ( Figure S6 C), consistent with results from bulk tumors in vivo . Additionally, H3B-8800 treatment induced significantly greater accumulation of dsRNA in 2208L and PyMT-M cell lines than in AT3 and T11 cell lines ( Figure 6 E). Importantly, H3B-8800 induced antiviral transcriptional targets Cxcl10 , Cxcl11 , and Tlr9 ( Figure 6 F) and secretion of CXCL10 protein ( Figure S6 D) in sensitive cell lines but had little or no effect in resistant cell lines ( Figure 6 F), suggesting that intron retention and dsRNA accumulation correlate with downstream induction of antiviral pathways in murine TNBC cells. Notably, cell lines from resistant tumor models (AT3 and T11) were largely recalcitrant to H3B-8800-induced cell death ( Figure S6 E). In contrast, H3B-8800 strongly induced apoptosis in tumor cells from the 2208L tumor model, consistent with its strong activation of dsRNA-antiviral programs and sensitivity to H3B-8800 in vivo ( Figure S6 E). Interestingly, H3B-8800 did not induce caspase-8 in tumor cells from the PyMT-M tumor model despite a strong activation of dsRNA antiviral response, possibly due to suppression of caspase-8 activity by the PyMT viral oncoprotein ( Courtneidge and Smith, 1983 20. Courtneidge, S.A. ∙ Smith, A.E. Polyoma virus transforming protein associates with the product of the c-src cellular gene Nature. 1983; 303 :435-439 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Tsang et al., 2016 117. Tsang, J.L. ∙ Jia, S.H. ∙ Parodo, J. ... Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Caspase-8 Abrogates Its Apoptotic Activity and Promotes Activation of c-Src PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0153946 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this observation, prior reports indicate that induction of antiviral transcriptional programs and apoptotic (caspase-8) mechanisms downstream of dsRNA sensing can be independent ( Lei et al., 2009 64. Lei, Y. ∙ Moore, C.B. ∙ Liesman, R.M. ... MAVS-mediated apoptosis and its inhibition by viral proteins PLoS ONE. 2009; 4 :e5466 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that these two outputs may be disengaged in some contexts. These results raise the possibility that H3B-8800-mediated tumor control in the PyMT-M model (and perhaps other tumor contexts) may occur through tumor cell non-autonomous mechanisms, a hypothesis that requires further investigation. Together, these data further support the model that accumulation of mis-spliced and double-stranded RNA induces antiviral signaling pathways within tumor cells.
Our RNA-seq analysis indicated that, in addition to antiviral signaling, signatures associated with adaptive immune engagement were upregulated in sensitive syngeneic models. H3B-8800 treatment led to increased expression of several T cell chemoattractants (such as Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 ) and corresponding adaptive immune gene sets ( Figures 6 C and 6D). On closer examination, expression of Cd4 and multiple common markers of T cell activation were increased in sensitive (but not resistant) models with H3B-8800 treatment ( Figures S6 F–S6I), which supports potential engagement of host T cells. We also assessed the “cytolytic index,” the co-expression of both granzyme A ( Gzma ) and perforin ( Prf1 ), as a proxy for CD8 + T cell activity ( Rooney et al., 2015 91. Rooney, M.S. ∙ Shukla, S.A. ∙ Wu, C.J. ... Molecular and genetic properties of tumors associated with local immune cytolytic activity Cell. 2015; 160 :48-61 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the cytolytic index was increased following H3B-8800 selectively in sensitive models ( Figure S6 J), suggesting CD8 + T cell activation in response to treatment with H3B-8800. Indeed, tumor infiltration of CD8 + T cells was significantly increased upon H3B-8800 treatment in PyMT-M tumors ( Figures S6 K and S6L), consistent with upregulation of gene sets related to T cell co-stimulation and T cell receptor signaling ( Figure 6 D). Overall, these findings support the model that spliceosome inhibition induces upregulation of both antiviral and adaptive immune signaling in tumor cells and provoke the hypothesis that STTs may, in some contexts, stimulate anti-tumor immunity, an area of study that requires further investigation.
The observations that global defects in tumor RNA splicing may activate adaptive immune signaling in murine models of breast cancer raise the question of whether similar effects occur in human breast cancer. While the effects of STTs have not yet been evaluated in breast cancer patients, we hypothesized that tumors with intrinsic global defects in splicing (as indicated by widespread IR) may instigate an immune response. To evaluate this hypothesis, we computed global IR levels across 983 TCGA primary breast tumors ( Koboldt et al., 2012 57. Koboldt, D.C. ∙ Fulton, R.S. ∙ McLellan, M.D. ..., Cancer Genome Atlas Network Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours Nature. 2012; 490 :61-70 Crossref Scopus (6284) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tested whether elevated IR correlates with expression signatures of tumor-infiltrating immune cells using immune cell single-sample GSEA analysis ( Barbie et al., 2009 7. Barbie, D.A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Boehm, J.S. ... Systematic RNA interference reveals that oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers require TBK1 Nature. 2009; 462 :108-112 Crossref Scopus (1100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, tumor IR levels significantly correlated with previously characterized T cell immune infiltration signatures ( Bindea et al., 2013 11. Bindea, G. ∙ Mlecnik, B. ∙ Tosolini, M. ... Spatiotemporal dynamics of intratumoral immune cells reveal the immune landscape in human cancer Immunity. 2013; 39 :782-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (863) PubMed Google Scholar ), including helper, memory, and effector T cells ( Figure 7 A; Table S4 ). When IR was considered as a categorical variable (high being >1 SD above and low being >1 SD below the cohort mean), IR continued to associate significantly with the same signatures ( Figure 7 A). We then used GSEA to more broadly query gene-expression differences between tumors with high and low intrinsic IR. Notably, immune signaling-related pathways made up 36% of significantly positively enriched pathways (FDR ≤ 0.01) ( Figure 7 B). Tumor mutational burden (TMB), a feature of cancers previously shown to be associated with immune recruitment and anti-tumor immunity ( Rizvi et al., 2015 89. Rizvi, N.A. ∙ Hellmann, M.D. ∙ Snyder, A. ...

Med. 2014; 371 :2189-2199 Crossref Scopus (2281) PubMed Google Scholar ), was negatively correlated with IR levels in this cohort ( Figure S7 A), suggesting tumor-intrinsic IR is a distinct feature correlating with immune engagement. Importantly, high IR is associated with improved patient disease-free survival ( Figure 7 C), suggesting that improved tumor control may be, in part, due to increased immune engagement seen in tumors with high levels of RNA mis-splicing.
MYC has been demonstrated to suppress immune engagement ( Bernards et al., 1986 9. Bernards, R. ∙ Dessain, S.K. ∙ Weinberg, R.A.

C-myc, not HER-2/neu, can predict recurrence and mortality of patients with node-negative breast cancer Breast Cancer Res. 2003; 5 :R30-R36 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this study has uncovered that oncogenic MYC primes cancer cells to activate antiviral immune signaling in the context of spliceosome perturbation. Therefore, we hypothesized that MYC amplification in tumor cells might augment the immune signaling associated with high baseline RNA mis-splicing. To test this, we divided tumors into four cohorts based on MYC copy number (amplified or normal as measured by GISTIC) and intron retention (IR high or low using aforementioned cutoffs). Utilizing GSEA, we compared gene-expression patterns of tumors in each of these cohorts to determine enrichment profiles unique to each group. Importantly, 7 of the top 10 enriched pathways in the high IR high MYC cohort were related to immune signaling ( Figure 7 D), while high IR normal MYC cohort exhibited enrichment of only 1 immune pathway. This same pattern was not observed with CCNE1, another commonly amplified gene in breast cancer ( Figure 7 E), suggesting a unique interaction between MYC and IR to induce immune signaling. These data are concordant with previous work ( Hsu et al., 2015 43. Hsu, T.Y.-T. ∙ Simon, L.M. ∙ Neill, N.J. ... The spliceosome is a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC-driven cancer Nature. 2015; 525 :384-388 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ) demonstrating that MYC drives sensitivity to spliceosome inhibition. More broadly, this lends evidence to the idea that IR burden may be a quantifiable intrinsic feature of tumors and that IR burden above a threshold could promote immune signaling in certain oncogenic contexts (like MYC amplification). The strong correlation of defective RNA processing and T cell recruitment could arise through multiple non-mutually exclusive mechanisms like activation of antiviral signaling and consequent recruitment of T cells, expression of neo-antigens, or others yet to be elucidated. Nonetheless, these data provoke the hypothesis that global RNA splicing defects, whether tumor intrinsic or induced by acute spliceosome inhibition, may stimulate adaptive immune responses.

Section: Discussion

Small-molecule modulators of the spliceosome exhibit potent anti-tumor activity across many cancers, though the mechanisms by which they kill tumors have been unclear. Important studies have characterized the mis-splicing of single genes or gene families in response to spliceosome inhibition, leading the field to focus on these aberrant protein products to explain sensitivity to spliceosome therapeutics. In contrast, we find that mis-spliced RNA itself may have an unrealized, broader function as a macromolecule in dictating tumor cell sensitivity to spliceosome inhibition. Our results show that tumor cell death is associated with accumulation and recognition of intron-resident dsRNA and subsequent activation of antiviral immune pathways. These results highlight endogenous mis-spliced RNA as an unexpected substrate for dsRNA sensors that can be leveraged therapeutically to engage a tumor cell-intrinsic immune response. Activation of tumor-intrinsic immune signaling via dsRNA-recognition pathways has been studied recently in the context of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors ( Chiappinelli et al., 2015 18. Chiappinelli, K.B. ∙ Strissel, P.L. ∙ Desrichard, A. ...

USA. 2017; 114 :E10981-E10990 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ADAR perturbations ( Gannon et al., 2018 34. Gannon, H.S. ∙ Zou, T. ∙ Kiessling, M.K. ...

However, in these scenarios it is unclear whether there is selectivity in dsRNA induction across tumor types or between tumor and non-malignant tissues. This study identifies introns as a distinctive source of endogenous dsRNA substrates that can be differentially induced in cancer cells, particularly those with hyperactivation of the MYC oncogene.
As recent clinical trials have demonstrated profound albeit heterogeneous success in modulating the immune system to treat cancer ( Sharma et al., 2017 103. Sharma, P. ∙ Hu-Lieskovan, S. ∙ Wargo, J.A. ... Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1194) PubMed Google Scholar ), the community has searched for tumor-intrinsic features that dictate whether the immune system can be stimulated to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. For instance, tumor mutational burden (TMB) and high burden of clonal tumor neoantigens have been shown to drive T cell infiltration into the tumor ( McGranahan et al., 2016 77. McGranahan, N. ∙ Furness, A.J.S. ∙ Rosenthal, R. ... Clonal neoantigens elicit T cell immunoreactivity and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade Science. 2016; 351 :1463-1469 Crossref Scopus (1260) PubMed Google Scholar ), and these features strongly associate with success of immune-checkpoint blockade ( Cristescu et al., 2018 21.

However, DNA aberrations (e.g., somatic mutations) are likely only one among many characteristics of tumors that drive tumor recognition by the immune system. We provide evidence that a high burden of RNA mis-splicing (in the form of intron retention) may be an unexplored feature of some cancers that engages tumor antiviral signaling and downstream adaptive immunity. Indeed, analysis of primary breast cancers supports this hypothesis, with tumors that harbor high levels of intron retention also exhibiting overexpression of gene-expression programs enriched for immune pathways, especially in tumors with MYC amplification. This observation suggests that inherent RNA-processing defects, which are a pervasive but heterogeneous feature of cancers, may induce tumor-intrinsic immune signaling in some contexts. It also raises the therapeutic hypothesis that RNA splicing defects may prime sensitivity to immune-checkpoint blockade or other therapies that engage adaptive immunity.
Finally, our results engender the idea that activation of cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity may be a common mechanism that responds to widespread splicing defects across cancer and other disease states. Aberrations in macromolecules such as DNA and protein are recognized by well-established pathways, such as the DNA damage response (DDR) and unfolded protein response (UPR). These pathways regulate coordinated responses to these aberrations to either restore cellular homeostasis or cause cell death and, in some contexts, serve as potent oncogenic checkpoints to prevent tumorigenesis. In contrast, while we are aware of important quality-control mechanisms for RNA such as nonsense-mediated decay, it has been unclear whether there are signaling pathways that sense widespread mis-splicing of RNA and dictate cell fate (e.g., apoptosis). We provide evidence that dsRNA sensing and antiviral signaling may serve as such a coordinated response for widespread mis-splicing of RNA, with intron-resident dsRNAs serving as a trigger for this response. Our data support the involvement of multiple dsRNA sensors, including but not limited to those that interface with MAVS, in dictating cell fate in response to widespread RNA mis-splicing. Our data suggest the presence of diverse pools of intron-containing dsRNA and concordant dsRNA sensors that trigger this antiviral immune response. In the future, it will be important to elucidate which pools of endogenous dsRNAs stimulate dsRNA sensors, and how the varied genetic/epigenetic context of cancer drivers like MYC may influence these dsRNA pools and sensors and prime tumors to dsRNA antiviral immune responses. More broadly, aberrantly spliced transcripts may be similarly sensed as dsRNA triggers in other pathologies with well-characterized RNA-processing defects such as Alzheimer disease, which is characterized by broad accumulation of mis-spliced RNA ( Bai et al., 2013 6. Bai, B. ∙ Hales, C.M. ∙ Chen, P.-C. ... U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex and RNA splicing alterations in Alzheimer’s disease Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Inflammation in Alzheimer disease: driving force, bystander or beneficial response? Nat. Med. 2006; 12 :1005-1015 Crossref Scopus (912) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the exciting possibility that antiviral immune signaling, a critical component of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, may be activated by surveillance and sensing of aberrantly spliced RNAs. Overall, our findings reveal dsRNA-mediated antiviral immunity as a sensing and response mechanism for broad cellular splicing defects, suggesting that deregulated RNA processing may contribute to cellular antiviral pathway activation in cancer and other diseases.

Section: Limitations of study

This study has focused on exploring the tumor cell-intrinsic responses to STTs, revealing that spliceosome inhibition triggers accumulation of dsRNA and activation of antiviral signaling pathways. Moreover, acute therapeutic spliceosome inhibition is sufficient in some contexts to stimulate both antiviral and adaptive immune signaling, as well as tumor T cell infiltration. However, further studies are needed to investigate the contribution of the adaptive immune response to the anti-tumoral activity of STTs. There are several outstanding questions requiring investigation. How does tumor cell-intrinsic activation of antiviral pathways in the context of STT treatment or other scenarios of RNA misprocessing communicate to the host adaptive immune compartment? What compartments of the adaptive immune system, if any, are required for STT anti-cancer efficacy? What are the effects of STTs on immune cell types and do they elicit counter-balancing effects on anti-tumor immunity? These areas of exploration will be critical to exploring whether STTs can be leveraged to galvanize the immune system against aggressive, immune-cold tumors like TNBC.

For cell line studies, SUM159 (female) cells were cultured in F12 media supplemented with 5% FBS, 10mM HEPES, 5ug/mL insulin, and 1ug/mL hydrocortisone. MDA-MB-231 (female), MDA-MB-231-LM2 (female) ( Minn et al., 2005 81. Minn, A.J. ∙ Gupta, G.P. ∙ Siegel, P.M. ... Genes that mediate breast cancer metastasis to lung Nature. 2005; 436 :518-524 Crossref Scopus (2008) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS. BT549 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS. HME1 (female) cells were cultured in MEGM (Lonza, CC-3150). MYC-ER HME1 cells were cultured in MEGM and treated with 10uM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) where indicated to induce MYC hyperactivation. PyMT-M (female), 2208L (female), and AT3 (female) cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin. T11 (female) cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 5ug/mL insulin, 1ug/mL hydrocortisone, 10ng/mL EGF, and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin. These cell lines were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination in the laboratory. All cell lines were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 .
For in vivo animal studies, all animal protocols related to mouse experiments were approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol AN-6672). 4-5-week-old female C57BL/6J and BALB/c AnNHsd mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (000664) and Envigo (4701F), respectively. Mice were housed in ventilated cages in a pathogen-free animal facility under a 14hr light/10hr dark cycle. 2208L, PyMT-M, and AT3 tumors were randomized onto vehicle or H3B-8800 at 150-250mm 3 for long term response studies or 300-500mm 3 for short term studies. Animals were allocated into treatment groups so that the average tumor size in both groups was similar. T11 tumors were randomized onto vehicle or H3B-8800 one day post tumor transplant. Sample size was determined for each syngeneic model separately based on previous tumor kinetic data.
Stable cell lines expressing shRNAs, sgRNAs, or cDNA were generated by retroviral or lentiviral transduction using 8ug/mL polybrene. Cells were selected using puromycin (1ug/mL). Transient depletion of genes using siRNA was achieved by reverse transfection of cell with 10pmol siRNA in RNAiMax for 12 hours. Depletion of target genes using shRNA or siRNA was confirmed using RT-qPCR. Knockout of genes using sgRNAs or expression of exogenous cDNA was confirmed using western blotting. See Table S5 for sequences of shRNAs used. See Table S5 for sequences of siRNAs used. See Key Resources Table for sgRNAs used.
Lentiviruses and retroviruses were generated by transfection of 293Ts with appropriate shRNA, sgRNA, or cDNA construct with packaging plasmids using Mirus Bio’s TransitIT transfection reagent. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 hours after transfection.
Total RNA (1ug/sample) was used as input for the TruSeq Stranded mRNA HT Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were made following Illumina’s recommended protocol, except for dsRNA libraries. For library preparation of J2 enriched dsRNA, first stranded cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript III (ThermoFisher Scientific) with the following modifications: RNA was heated to 70°C for 3 minutes to reduce secondary structure, followed by reverse transcription for 10 minutes at 25°C, 50 minutes at 50°C, and 15 minutes at 70°C. Amplified libraries were purified and quantified using the KAPA quantification kit (Roche). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument as 75-bp paired-end reads. In Figures 1 A–1D SD6 gene expression analyses, cells were treated with DMSO or SD6 GI40 dose (200nM for SUM159 and 50nM for LM2).
After demultiplexing, reads for both human and mouse samples were processed using SAMtools (v1.4) ( Li et al., 2009 65. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (21090) PubMed Google Scholar ) and aligned using the splice aware aligner Hisat2 (v2.0.4) ( Kim et al., 2015a 55. Kim, D. ∙ Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. HISAT: a fast spliced aligner with low memory requirements Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :357-360 Crossref Scopus (4207) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. The coordinates and gene annotations used in all subsequent analyses were based on the human (hg38/GRCh38) and mouse (mm10/GRCm38) reference genome builds and the corresponding UCSC RefSeq genes unless otherwise noted.
Gene expression FPKM values used for downstream GSEA analyses were obtained using the cufflinks suite (v2.2.1) ( Trapnell et al., 2010 116. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (8248) PubMed Google Scholar ). For analysis of differential gene expression changes in “sensitive” versus “resistant” syngeneic tumors after H3B-8800 treatment, the following pipeline was employed: featureCounts (v1.6.2) ( Liao, Smyth and Shi, 2014 67. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (4035) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to quantify counts, followed by interaction analysis using DESeq2 ( Love, Huber and Anders, 2014 73. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (14911) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following design: ~response + treatment + response:treatment. Annotations for repeat elements were obtained from RepeatMasker (open-4.0.5). Counting of reads mapped to annotated repeat elements was performed using the Python module Pysam ( Li et al., 2009 65. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (21090) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression was then RPKM normalized.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on genes differentially expressed after spliceosome inhibition in human cell lines and syngeneic murine tumors (p ≥ 0.05). Reactome pathways from the MSigDB database ( Liberzon et al., 2011 68. Liberzon, A. ∙ Subramanian, A. ∙ Pinchback, R. ... Molecular signatures database (MSigDB) 3.0 Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :1739-1740 Crossref Scopus (1408) PubMed Google Scholar ; Subramanian et al., 2005 110. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (17346) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used for human data analysis; the “Mouse_AllPathways_June_24_2016_symbol.gmt” pathway collection from the Bader lab ( http://baderlab.org/GeneSets ), consisting of C2 Canonical Pathways (C2 CP) was used for mouse GSEA data analysis. Pathway over-representation of genes with differential gene expression changes in “sensitive” versus “resistant” syngeneic tumors after H3B-8800 treatment was performed using Metascape ( Zhou et al., 2019 137. Zhou, Y. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Pache, L. ... Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1523 Crossref Scopus (768) PubMed Google Scholar ) using C2 CP annotations.
Hisat2-aligned reads were filtered for proper-paired reads (-f 2 flag in SAMtools). Intron annotations were parsed from UCSC RefSeq gene annotation files and were filtered to exclude features that overlap genomic loci on the same strand. Reads mapping to introns were counted using Pysam. For each intron feature, we defined the following two read classes: (1) “intronic” reads mapping at least 6 bases contiguously within the intron and (2) “spanning” reads with ends mapping to the flanking exons. The intron retention (IR) score was then computed as the ratio of the RPKM-normalized “intronic” read density over the RPKM-normalized “spanning” read density. In order to compare commonly expressed IR events across samples, introns with < 10 spanning RPKM in any sample were excluded from all analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using R. Empirical cumulative distributions of IR scores were compared, and p values estimated using a Mann-Whitney U test.
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Synthesis of cDNA was done using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems). RT-qPCR was performed using the SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on 20ng of input cDNA. Relative transcript abundance was normalized ( GAPDH for human samples, 18 s for mouse samples) and assessed using the Applied Biosystems StepOne Software v2.1. Data were calculated as log 2 (fold change) relative to control data using the ΔΔCt method. All experiments were performed in biological triplicate. For intron retention analysis, primer sets were designed to measure intron-containing transcripts and fully spliced transcripts. Intron retention was calculated as the ratio of intron-containing transcripts over fully spliced transcripts. Data were calculated as fold change relative to control data using the ΔΔCt method. For enzymatic dsRNA structure probing, relative transcript abundance was normalized ( ACTB ) and data were calculated as fold change relative to control data using the ΔΔCt method. In Figures 1 G and 1H, MYC-ER HME1 cells were treated with 10nM 4-OHT and 10nM H3B-8800. In Figure 2 E, SUM159 cells were treated with 200nM SD6. In Figures 5 J and S5W, SUM159 cells were treated 15nM H3B-8800. In Figure 4 , SUM159 cells were treated with 100nM H3B-8800. In Figure S5 F, SUM159 cells were treated with 100nM H3B-8800. In Figure 6 I, syngeneic tumor-derived cell lines were treated with 50nM H3B-8800. In Figure 6 K, syngeneic tumor-derived cell lines were treated with 25nM H3B-8800. See Table S6 for primer sequences.
Innate immune transcriptional changes in response to treatment with H3B-8800 were measured using RT 2 Profiler PCR Array Human Antiviral Response (QIAGEN, 330231) following treatment of SUM159s (DMSO or 25nM H3B-8800) and LM2s (DMSO or 25nM H3B-8800). Relative transcript abundance was normalized to B2M and assessed using the Applied Biosystems StepOne Software v2.1. Data were calculated as fold change relative to control data using the ΔΔCt method. All experiments were performed in biological triplicate.
SUM159 cells were treated with DMSO or 25nM H3B-8800 and conditioned media was collected for analysis using the Luminex Assay. Conditioned media was incubated overnight with analyte targeted beads and analyte concentration was calculated based on analyte standard curve. Concentration was normalized to cell number determined by Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) staining of a duplicate plate, followed by nuclei counting using the Celigo Imaging Cell Cytometer (Brooks).
The FKBP12 F36V fragment ( Nabet et al., 2018 83. Nabet, B. ∙ Roberts, J.M. ∙ Buckley, D.L. ... The dTAG system for immediate and target-specific protein degradation Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14 :431-441 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ) was fused to the C terminus of SF3B1 cDNA and cloned into a pHAGE-PGK backbone. Cas9 was amplified from pCW-Cas9 ( Wang et al., 2014 121. Wang, T. ∙ Wei, J.J. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. ... Genetic screens in human cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Science. 2014; 343 :80-84 Crossref Scopus (1488) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cloned into pINDUCER20 to allow for dox-inducible Cas9 expression ( Meerbrey et al., 2011 78. Meerbrey, K.L. ∙ Hu, G. ∙ Kessler, J.D. ... The pINDUCER lentiviral toolkit for inducible RNA interference in vitro and in vivo Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :3665-3670 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ). This vector was transduced into SUM159 cells and was selected with neomycin. A clone was selected to generate SUM159-Cas9 cells with homogeneous Cas9 expression and inducibility. SUM159 cells stably expressing dox-inducible Cas9 were transduced with the SF3B1- FKBP12 F36V lentivirus and then selected with puromycin. To knock out the endogenous SF3B1 locus, Cas9 expression was turned on with 500 ng/mL of doxycycline for 24 hours, followed by 48 hour co-transfection of Edit-R tracrRNA (Dharmacon) and crRNA targeting the first intron-exon junction of SF3B1. A single clone was then selected, and western blotting was used to confirm knockout of the endogenous protein and expression of SF3B1- FKBP12 F36V . SF3B1 degradation was assayed using 10nM dTAG-51 ( Nabet et al., 2018 83. Nabet, B. ∙ Roberts, J.M. ∙ Buckley, D.L. ... The dTAG system for immediate and target-specific protein degradation Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14 :431-441 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the stated durations. Gene expression analysis in Figure 1 J was performed following treatment with DMSO or 10nM dTAG-51. Immunofluorescence assay in Figure 3 F were performed following 10nM dTAG-51 treatment.
Cell lysates were collected in RIPA Buffer + Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 11836170001) + Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma, P5726), then mixed with 6x Laemmli SDS reducing buffer (Alfa Aesar, J61337) before incubation at 95°C for 10 minutes. Protein lysates were quantified using Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, 23225). Samples were loaded for SDS-PAGE using homemade tris-glycine gels and run in SDS running buffer.
Proteins were transferred using wet transfer to 0.45 μM Nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Life Science, 10600007). The membrane was blocked for 1 hours using 5% BSA in TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20 in 1x TBS) and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The membrane was then washed 3 times in TBS-T for 5 minutes before incubation with the secondary antibody at RT for 2 hours. The membrane was then washed 3 times with TBST before incubation with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, 170-5060) and imaging with the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad).
SUM159s were transduced with a MSCV-based retroviral library ( Rousseaux et al., 2018 93. Rousseaux, M.W.C. ∙ Vázquez-Vélez, G.E. ∙ Al-Ramahi, I. ... A druggable genome screen identifies modifiers of α-synuclein levels via a tiered cross-species validation approach J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :9286-9301 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) containing a total of 18,370 shRNAs divided into two separate pools at a MOI of 0.5 and a target representation of 1000 cellular integrations for each shRNA. After transduction, cells were selected for 3 days in puromycin, then split into parallel ± SD6 arms (in quadruplicate) and cultured for 12 population doublings. During this time, cells were passaged every 3 days (6 passages for DMSO treated, 7 passages for SD6 treated). After selection (T0) and at each subsequent passage, 20 million cells were collected from each replicate and stored at −80°C. Cell pellets from T0 and the final passage were used for downstream analysis.
The QIAamp DNA Blood Midi kit (QIAGEN) was used to extract genomic DNA from cell pellets followed by ethanol precipitation to clean and concentrate. Half-hairpin sequences were amplified from the genomic DNA (primers 5′- TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTA-3′ and 5′- GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTATAAACGGTTGGTCTTCCAA-3′) using Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB). PCR reactions were cleaned up using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) followed by measurement of the concentration of the target amplicon using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation. DNA samples were indexed using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) and size selected to remove spurious amplification products using the PippinHT (Sage Science). Indexed and size-selected samples were quantified using the KAPA Illumina Library Quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems) and pooled at equal concentration prior to sequencing using the HiSeq 2500 System (Illumina) in single-end, 100bp, high-output mode using v4 SBS reagents.
Cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 76. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. J. 2011; 17 :10 Crossref Google Scholar ) was used to remove adaptor sequences from reads, followed by alignment to the reference library using Bowtie 2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 61. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (16313) PubMed Google Scholar ) in end-to-end mode, allowing up to a maximum of 3 mismatches/indels compared to the reference sequence. The number of reads mapping to each shRNA in each sample was then extracted from the SAM files and DESeq2 ( Love, Huber and Anders, 2014 73. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (14911) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to determine the fold-change in abundance of each shRNA between the vehicle and SD6-treated arms after 12 population doublings. shRNA-level fold-change estimates were combined to gene-level estimates by summing the individual fold-changes of all “significant” shRNAs (p value < 0.05 and absolute fold-change > 0.5) mapped to a given gene. Gene-level p values were calculated by combining the individual p values of all “significant” shRNAs mapping to a given gene using Fisher’s method. Gene-level weighted growth effects were calculated by multiplying the gene-level fold change by the -log 10 (gene-level p value).
Analysis of over-represented Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) was performed using the R package “meshes” (v1.8.0) ( Yu, 2018 130. Yu, G. Using meshes for MeSH term enrichment and semantic analyses Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :3766-3767 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following parameters: MeSHDb = ‘MeSH.Hsa.eg.db’, database = ‘gene2pubmed’ and category = ‘C’. For Cytoscape visualization, individual genes in MeSH term categories were set as nodes and common MeSH terms as edges. Pathway over-representation for screen candidates was performed using StringDB (v11.0) ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 113. Szklarczyk, D. ∙ Gable, A.L. ∙ Lyon, D. ... STRING v11: protein-protein association networks with increased coverage, supporting functional discovery in genome-wide experimental datasets Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D607-D613 Crossref Scopus (1848) PubMed Google Scholar ).
SUM159 cells were transduced with MSCV retroviral shRNAs targeting Firefly luciferase (shControl), RNF128, RNF125, UBE2D1, or USP1 and selected for three days with puromycin. After selection, these cells were mixed at a 40:60 ratio with SUM159 cells transduced with pHAGE-PGK-E2 Crimson and grown in 96-well plates in the presence of DMSO or 200nM SD6. At seeding and when the cells reached confluence, cells were passaged and the percentage of E2-Crimson-positive cells was measured by flow cytometry. The percentage of shRNA knockdown cells was calculated as the percentage of non-E2 Crimson positive cells.
Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 x with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X for 10 minutes at RT. Cells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 15 minutes at RT before incubating with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-dsRNA J2 (Scicons, 10010500) ( Schönborn et al., 1991 97. Schönborn, J. ∙ Oberstrass, J. ∙ Breyel, E. ... Monoclonal antibodies to double-stranded RNA as probes of RNA structure in crude nucleic acid extracts Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 :2993-3000 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), monoclonal anti-MAVS (Cell Signaling, 24930)) diluted in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. Cells were washed 3 x with PBS before incubation with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, A11029) for J2 antibody and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, A11012) for MAVS antibody), Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, H3570), and Phalloidin (Invitrogen, A12381) for 1 hour at RT in the dark. Cells were washed 3 x with PBS before mounting on coverslips with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, H-1000).
SUM159, MDA-MB-231, and BT549 cells were treated with DMSO or 100nM H3B-8800 before processing. LM2 cells were treated with DMSO or 50nM H3B- before processing. In Figure 3 E, MYC-ER HME1 cells were treated with 10nM 4-OHT and 20nM H3B-8800. In Figure S3 C, SUM159 and HME1 cells were treated with DMSO or 50nM H3B-8800 before processing. In Figure 6 J, syngeneic tumor-derived cell lines were treated with DMSO or 20nM H3B-8800 before processing. When indicated, cells were incubated with 4U RNaseIII (Applied Biosystems, A2290) in reaction buffer at 37C for 4 hours as instructed after permeabilization. For J2 dsRNA imaging, cells were imaged and analyzed on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope with the NIS-Element AR 4.30 software. Briefly, images were captured with Z stacked (0.3um) setting under 60X oil objective lens and Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera. For quantification the cytoplasmic J2 intensity, a ROI defining cytoplasm was determined by the Hoechst and Phalloidin staining for each cell. The average fluorescent intensity for defined ROIs and background from the same image were directly measured by the NIS-Element AR software. J2 intensity for each cell was defined by difference between the ROI and background intensity. J2 intensity was normalized to mean intensity in the DMSO treated state for each experiment. Plots shown in figures are from one representative experiment of more than three independent experiments.
The SF3B1 R1074H mutant was generated in pDONR221 using the QuikChange II Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). SF3B1 WT and SF3B1 R1074H were FLAG-tagged then cloned into pINDUCER20 to allow for dox-inducible expression. This vector was transduced into SUM159 and LM2 cells. H3B-8800 dose curve assay was performed by treating SUM159 and LM2 cells with 1ug/mL doxycycline followed by the indicated concentration of H3B-8800. Cell numbers were determined by Hoechst 33342 staining, followed by nuclei counting using the Celigo Imaging Cell Cytometer (Brooks). Western blot analysis of inducible protein expression was performed with the same treatment conditions. Intron retention following treatment of SUM159 cells ± 1 ug/mL doxycycline for 24 hours followed by 12 hours of treatment with 100nM H3B-8800 using RT-qPCR. Immunofluorescence assays were performed ± 1 ug/mL doxycycline for 24 hours followed by DMSO or 50nM H3B-8800 treatment.
SUM159 cells were treated with 100nM H3B-8800 or DMSO, collected in biological duplicate in ice-cold PBS, then spun down at 180 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was removed, and cells were lysed in cytoplasmic lysis buffer (CLB: 10mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10mM KCl, 1mM MgCl2, 0.5mM EDTA, 1mM DDT, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 1 U/ul RNasin Plus) for 5 minutes on ice. Lysates were spun down at 1000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant, or cytoplasmic fraction, was transferred to separate tubes for collecting RNA and protein. The cell pellet was washed once with CLB and lysed on ice in high salt nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS) for 5 minutes on ice. The lysate was then divided for collecting RNA and protein. Equal cell-normalized quantities of protein were analyzed by western blot to confirm fractional purity (total H3 for nuclear fraction, α-Tubulin for cytoplasmic fraction).
Custom Stellaris® FISH probes were designed against SEC14L1 and SETD1A by utilizing the Stellaris® RNA FISH Probe Designer (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Petaluma, CA) available online at www.biosearchtech.com/stellarisdesigner (see Table S7 for probe sequences). The probe sets were hybridized with TAMRA (intronic probe sets) and Quasar 670® (exonic probe sets). RNA FISH was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions available online at http://www.biosearchtech.com/stellaris-designer . with minor modifications. In brief, SUM159 cells were treated with DMSO or 100nM H3B-8800. Fixation and permeabilization were performed as described for immunofluorescence. After permeabilization, cells were washed 2 x with PBS and 1x with Wash Buffer A (Bioresearch Technologies, SMF-WA1-60) with 10% (v/v) formamide (Ambion, AM9342) at RT for 5 minutes. Coverslips were than incubated in the Hybridization Buffer (Bioresearch Technologies, #SMF-HB1-10) with 10% (v/v) formamide containing indicated probes at 37°C overnight in a humidified chamber. Coverslips were washed with Wash Buffer A at 37°C for 30 minutes, then incubated with Wash Buffer A containing Hoechst for 37°C for 30 minutes. Samples were then washed with Wash Buffer B (Bioresearch Technologies, #SMF-WB1-20) at RT for 5 minutes. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, H-1000). All steps following hybridization were done protected from light. Imaging was performed and processed as previously described using a GE Healthcare DVLive epifluorescence microscope. After imaging, Z stacks were transformed into a 2D image by maximal projection. Cytoplasmic intron and exon foci for each cell were manually counted by the ImageJ software. Plots shown in figures are representative of two independent experiments.
Protein A Dynabeads were washed and resuspended in NT-2 buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630). Per sample, 100ul of beads were pre-bound to 5 ug of anti-dsRNA mAb (J2) overnight at 4°C. SUM159 cells were treated with 100nM H3B-8800 or DMSO, collected in biological duplicate in ice-cold PBS, then spun down at 180 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was removed, and cells were lysed in 1mL RIP buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 1 U/ul RNasin Plus) for 5 minutes on ice. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf. Total RNA was harvested from 10% input lysate using Trizol. For immunoprecipitation, 100 ul of J2-bound Protein A Dynabeads was added to the remaining lysate and incubated for 3 hours at 4°C with constant mixing. Beads were washed three times with NT-2 buffer, transferred to a new tube, and then washed three times with high salt wash buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS). J2-bound dsRNA was harvested directly from beads with Trizol. Chloroform was added at a ratio of 1:5, and RNA was isolated from the aqueous phase using the RNA Clean and Concentrator columns (Zymo).
RNA structure prediction was done using the RNAfold web server ( http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi ) with default options.
SUM159 cells were treated with 100nM H3B-8800 or DMSO, collected in biological triplicate in ice-cold PBS, then spun down at 180 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was removed and cells were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed in 1mL RIP buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 1 U/ul RNasin Plus) for 5 minutes on ice. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf. Lysates were treated with or without 5U RNaseOne (Promega, M4261) for 30 minutes at room temperature. RNA was harvested using Trizol. Chloroform was added at a ratio of 1:5, and RNA was isolated from the aqueous phase using the RNA Clean and Concentrator columns (Zymo). First stranded cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript III (ThermoFisher Scientific) with the following modifications: RNA was heated to 70°C for 3 minutes to reduce secondary structure, followed by reverse transcription for 10 minutes at 25°C, 50 minutes at 50°C, and 15 minutes at 70°C. Transcript abundance was measured using RT-qPCR using the SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on 20ng of input cDNA. Relative transcript abundance in samples treated with and without RNaseOne was normalized ( ACTB ) and assessed using the Applied Biosystems StepOne Software v2.1. The dsRNA/ssRNA fold enrichment was calculated using the ΔΔCt method comparing relative transcript abundance in the sample treated with RNaseOne to the sample treated without RNaseOne.
PI positive cells were assessed by incubating cells with 1:100 dilution of Propidium Iodide (Sigma Aldrich, P4864) for 15 minutes before counting using the Celigo Imaging Cell Cytometer (Brooks). Number of PI positive foci was normalized to cell number determined by Hoechst 33342 staining of a duplicate plate, followed by nuclei counting using Celigo Imaging Cell Cytometer (Brooks). Cell viability was assessed by incubating CellTiterGlo (Promega, G7570) with cells for 10 minutes in a 96-well plate and measuring luminescence with a plate reader (Molecular Devices). SUM159 cells were treated with 50nM H3B-8800. Luminescence was normalized to cell number as described above.
Caspase-3/7 and Caspase-8 activity was assessed in breast cancer lines by incubating Caspase-Glo 3/7 (Promega, G8090) and −8 (Promega, G8200) reagent with cells for one hour in a 96-well plate and measuring luminescence with a plate reader (Molecular Devices). SUM159 and LM2 cells were treated with 50nM H3B-8800 for 36 hours or with 200nM SD6 and 1ug/mL ZVAD, ZIETD, Z-AEVD, or Z-LEHD (R&D Systems) as annotated. MYC-ER HME1 cells were treated with 10nM 4-OHT and 20nM H3B-8800. 2208L, PyMT-M, AT3, and 2208L cells were treated with 50nM H3B-8800. Luminescence was normalized to cell number determined by Hoechst 33342 staining of a duplicate plate, followed by nuclei counting using the Celigo Imaging Cell Cytometer (Brooks).
LM2 and SUM159 cells were treated with DMSO or 20nM H3B-8800. High resolution imaging was performed on a GE Healthcare DVLive epifluorescence image restoration microscope using an Olympus PlanApo 60x/1.42 NA objective and a 1.9k x 1.9x sCMOS camera. Z stacks (0.25μm) were acquired before applying a conservative restorative algorithm for quantitative image deconvolution. Max intensity projections were generated and used for image analysis. To quantify the spatial distribution of the MAVS signal, we measured a dispersion index using a custom-made MATLAB script. Briefly, z stacks were transformed into a 2D image by maximal projection. Single cells were then manually segmented using an interactive polygonal ROI. The dispersion index of the MAVS signal for each cell was then determined as follows: first, the MAVS signal was segmented using an Otsu thresholding method, and the weighted centroid location of the resulting mask was determined using the underlying pixel intensities. Then, the distance between each pixel of the MAVS mask to the weighted centroid was calculated and the dispersion index was defined as the mean of these distances. Aggregation was calculated as the inverse of the dispersion index.
SUM159 and LM2 cells treated with DMSO, 20nM H3B-8800, or 0.5ug/mL p (I:C) (Sigma Aldrich, P1530) were washed with ice-cold PBS and detached using a cell scraper. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in Buffer A (10mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.25 M D-mannitol, and Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail), and lysed by repeated douncing. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to isolate the P5 mitochondrial fraction. SDD-AGE was performed according to a previously published protocol ( Halfmann and Lindquist, 2008 39. Halfmann, R. ∙ Lindquist, S. Screening for amyloid aggregation by Semi-Denaturing Detergent-Agarose Gel Electrophoresis J. Vis. Exp. 2008; 17 :838 PubMed Google Scholar ) with slight modifications. Crude P5 mitochondria was resuspended in 1 x sample buffer (0.5 x TBE, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.0025% bromophenol blue) and run on a vertical agarose gel (1.5% agarose with 0.1% SDS in 1 x TBE) in running buffer (1 x TBE with 0.1% SDS) for 45 minutes at a constant 100 V in 4°C. Protein was transferred using capillary transfer overnight to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting.
Tumor chunks were transplanted into clear mammary fat pad of 4-5 week old female C57BL/6J or BALB/c AnNHsd female mice. 2208L, PyMT-M, and AT3 tumors were randomized onto vehicle or H3B-8800 (8 mg/kg in 0.5% methylcellulose daily) at 150-250mm 3 for long term response studies or 300-500mm 3 for short term studies. T11 tumors were randomized onto vehicle or H3B-8800 one day post tumor transplant. Tumor volume was measured using calipers three days per week. Tumors were harvested between 1500 and 2000 mm 3 . Tissue chunks were stored in RNAlater for gene expression profiling. Tissue for IHC analysis was fixed in PFA, 70% EtOH, then paraffin embedded.
Tumor chunks were fixed in 10% formalin overnight at 4°C overnight, and subsequently transferred into 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at regular intervals. Slides were deparaffinized and hydrated using xylene, graded ethyl alcohol, and dH2O. After antigen retrieval, 15 minutes of steaming at 90°C with pressure in 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 5 minutes. Sections were incubated with primary antibody (CD8a, Cell Signaling 98941 diluted 1:100) for 1hr at RT. Sections were then incubated with Envision Labeled Polymer-HRP (Dako) for 30 minutes at RT. DAB+ solution (DakoCytomation) was then added to section, incubated for 15 minutes, followed by application of DAB Sparkle Enhancer (Biocare). Sections were counterstained with Harris Hematoxylin. Counting of CD8a+ stained cells was done using the Count Tool in Adobe Photoshop.
Analysis of immune cell gene signatures was performed using single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( Barbie et al., 2009 7. Barbie, D.A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Boehm, J.S. ... Systematic RNA interference reveals that oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers require TBK1 Nature. 2009; 462 :108-112 Crossref Scopus (1100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Marker genes for immune cell types were obtained from ( Bindea et al., 2013 11. Bindea, G. ∙ Mlecnik, B. ∙ Tosolini, M. ... Spatiotemporal dynamics of intratumoral immune cells reveal the immune landscape in human cancer Immunity. 2013; 39 :782-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (863) PubMed Google Scholar ). Heatmaps display z-score normalized IR levels and ssGSEA scores across samples, with “high” and “low” IR being defined as having an IR level outside one standard deviation of the mean.
Intron retention analysis was performed on BRCA TCGA RNA sequencing datasets ( Koboldt et al., 2012 57. Koboldt, D.C. ∙ Fulton, R.S. ∙ McLellan, M.D. ..., Cancer Genome Atlas Network Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours Nature. 2012; 490 :61-70 Crossref Scopus (6284) PubMed Google Scholar ). TCGA fastq reads were mapped using the STAR aligner (v2.3.1) ( Dobin et al., 2013 28. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (9723) PubMed Google Scholar ) onto the hg19/GRCh37 reference genome as previously described ( Hsu et al., 2015 43. Hsu, T.Y.-T. ∙ Simon, L.M. ∙ Neill, N.J. ... The spliceosome is a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC-driven cancer Nature. 2015; 525 :384-388 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Level of intron retention (IR level) within each sample was calculated as the number of introns with IR scores > 0.01, as defined previously. “High” and “Low” IR were defined as having an IR level outside one standard deviation of the mean. RSEM normalized gene expression data from TCGA was obtained from the Broad GDAC Firehose. Copy number was obtained from cBioPortal as GISTIC2.0 data. Copy number analysis was done by segregating tumors based on a score of ≥ 1 (“High”) versus ≤ 0 (“Low” or normal). GSEA was performed using C2 Canonical Pathway annotations. TMB was obtained from GDC mutation data using the TCGAbiolinks R package ( Colaprico et al., 2016 19. Colaprico, A. ∙ Silva, T.C. ∙ Olsen, C. ... TCGAbiolinks: an R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis of TCGA data Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :e71 e71 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ). Survival data was obtained from the GDC portal and KM curves were plotted using the survminer R package. P values were calculated using log-rank test.
Data are typically mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test between two groups, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. GraphPad Prism or R were used to generate all charts and statistical analyses. Statistical details of experiments, including statistical tests and sample sizes used, can be found in the figure legends. All experiments were performed on biological replicates unless otherwise specified.
