Title: Augmenting NK cell-based immunotherapy by targeting mitochondrial apoptosis


Abstract: Summary

Interest in harnessing natural killer (NK) cells for cancer immunotherapy is rapidly growing. However, efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapy remains limited in most trials. Strategies to augment the killing efficacy of NK cells are thus much needed. In the current study, we found that mitochondrial apoptosis (mtApoptosis) pathway is essential for efficient NK killing, especially at physiologically relevant effector-to-target ratios. Furthermore, NK cells can prime cancer cells for mtApoptosis and mitochondrial priming status affects cancer-cell susceptibility to NK-mediated killing. Interestingly, pre-activating NK cells confers on them resistance to BH3 mimetics. Combining BH3 mimetics with NK cells synergistically kills cancer cells in vitro and suppresses tumor growth in vivo . The ideal BH3 mimetic to use in such an approach can be predicted by BH3 profiling. We herein report a rational and precision strategy to augment NK-based immunotherapy, which may be adaptable to T cell-based immunotherapies as well.

Section: Introduction

In the past decade, therapeutic advances in immunotherapy have revolutionized the treatment of multiple cancers. T cells have been at the forefront of immunotherapy research. Despite the successful application of T cell-based immunotherapies to a broad range of cancers, overall, only a fraction of patients experience a life-changing durable response ( June et al., 2018 23. June, C.H. ∙ O'Connor, R.S. ∙ Kawalekar, O.U. ... CAR T cell immunotherapy for human cancer Science. 2018; 359 :1361-1365 Crossref Scopus (1857) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ribas and Wolchok, 2018 45.

Sharma, P. ∙ Allison, J.P. Dissecting the mechanisms of immune checkpoint therapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :75-76 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ). NK cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes of the innate immune system distinguished by their ability to spontaneously detect and kill infected or malignant cells. NK cells use an array of activating receptors to recognize germline-encoded ligands upregulated on stressed cancer cells without requiring tumor neoantigen presentation by MHC molecules as T cells do ( Crinier et al., 2020 9. Crinier, A. ∙ Narni-Mancinelli, E. ∙ Ugolini, S. ... SnapShot: natural killer cells Cell. 2020; 180 :1280-1280.e1 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lanier, 2008 27.

Raulet, D.H. ∙ Guerra, N. Oncogenic stress sensed by the immune system: role of natural killer cell receptors Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9 :568-580 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, NK cells can kill cancer cells with low mutational burden or those lacking neoantigen presentation. Therefore, theoretically a broader spectrum of cancers might respond to NK cellular therapy and NK cells could potentially combat resistance to T cell-based therapies ( Bald et al., 2020 3.

Myers, J.A. ∙ Miller, J.S. Exploring the NK cell platform for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 18 :85-100 Crossref Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ). Currently, the leading approach of NK-based therapy is the adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells. Adoptive NK cell transfer is comparatively safe, with low risk of graft-versus-host disease or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) ( Miller et al., 2005 33. Miller, J.S. ∙ Soignier, Y. ∙ Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A. ...

Effectiveness of donor natural killer cell alloreactivity in mismatched hematopoietic transplants Science. 2002; 295 :2097-2100 Crossref Scopus (2836) PubMed Google Scholar ). The safety profile also makes NK cells highly feasible for “off-the-shelf” manufacturing. These promising features have led to rapidly increasing laboratory and clinical efforts dedicated to advancing NK-based immunotherapies.
Preclinical evidence and early clinical successes have established NK immunotherapy as a safe, feasible, and promising therapeutic strategy. For example, human NK cell adoptive transfer has been shown to suppress primary tumor growth and secondary metastases in mice ( Huntington et al., 2020 21.

Exploring the NK cell platform for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 18 :85-100 Crossref Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clinical studies, particularly those in patients with blood cancers and neuroblastoma have shown encouraging results. Some clinical trials have reported responses in 1/3 to 1/2 of the patients. Nonetheless, the efficacy of adoptive NK transfer remains unsatisfying and limited in most trials ( Childs and Carlsten, 2015 8. Childs, R.W. ∙ Carlsten, M.

Drug Discov. 2015; 14 :487-498 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ; Myers and Miller, 2021 37. Myers, J.A. ∙ Miller, J.S. Exploring the NK cell platform for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev.

Drug Discov. 2020; 19 :200-218 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To augment the therapeutic efficacy of NK cells, most current studies revolve around two focal points: optimizing the source of NK cells and improving their functionality and persistence in vivo ( Kundu et al., 2021 25. Kundu, S. ∙ Gurney, M. ∙ O'Dwyer, M. Generating natural killer cells for adoptive transfer: expanding horizons Cytotherapy. 2021; 23 :559-566 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Myers and Miller, 2021 37.

Shimasaki, N. ∙ Jain, A. ∙ Campana, D. NK cells for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2020; 19 :200-218 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the current study, we took a different approach by studying how to make cancer cells more vulnerable to NK killing. We found that mitochondrial apoptosis (mtApoptosis) played an essential role in NK-mediated killing. Modulating mtApoptosis priming status (mitochondrial readiness for apoptosis) affected cancer-cell susceptibility to NK cells. Additionally, NK treatment drove surviving cancer cells closer to mtApoptosis thresholds. We therefore hypothesized that increasing mtApoptosis priming with BH3 mimetics would synergize with NK cells in pushing cancer cells across apoptotic thresholds, thus augmenting NK-mediated killing. We also hypothesized that BH3 profiling ( Letai, 2017 28. Letai, A. Functional precision cancer medicine-moving beyond pure genomics Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1028-1035 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ; Montero et al., 2015 35. Montero, J. ∙ Sarosiek, K.A. ∙ DeAngelo, J.D. ... Drug-induced death signaling strategy rapidly predicts cancer response to chemotherapy Cell. 2015; 160 :977-989 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ) could predict which BH3 mimetic would best synergize with NK cells on different cancer cells. In the present study, in vitro and in vivo models with different anti-apoptotic dependencies were utilized to examine our hypotheses.

Section: Results

NK cells and T cells can deliver granzymes or utilize death ligands to trigger apoptosis of cancer cells ( Guillerey et al., 2016 17. Guillerey, C. ∙ Huntington, N.D. ∙ Smyth, M.J.

NK cells and cancer: you can teach innate cells new tricks Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :7-19 Crossref Scopus (841) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been reported that recombinant granzyme B induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria of Jurkat cells ( Goping et al., 2003 16. Goping, I.S. ∙ Barry, M. ∙ Liston, P. ...

Chem. 2001; 276 :12060-12067 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sutton et al., 2003 59. Sutton, V.R. ∙ Wowk, M.E. ∙ Cancilla, M. ... Caspase activation by granzyme B is indirect, and caspase autoprocessing requires the release of proapoptotic mitochondrial factors Immunity. 2003; 18 :319-329 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it remains unclear to what extent mtApoptosis machinery is required for NK cell-mediated killing, especially at relatively low effector-to-target (E:T) ratios. Indeed, many studies use high E:T ratios (e.g., 3:1, 10:1, or higher) in cytotoxic cell-killing assays. However, in tumor stroma, cytotoxic cells are almost always outnumbered by cancer cells ( Galon and Bruni, 2019 15. Galon, J. ∙ Bruni, D. Approaches to treat immune hot, altered and cold tumours with combination immunotherapies Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18 :197-218 Crossref Scopus (1913) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shimasaki et al., 2020 55. Shimasaki, N. ∙ Jain, A. ∙ Campana, D. NK cells for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2020; 19 :200-218 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such high E:T ratios may not reflect how cancer cells are killed in vivo .
In the present study, we first investigated if primary NK cells induce mtApoptosis or other forms of programed cell death at relatively low E:T ratios. OCI-AML3 was chosen to represent blood cancers because it is a widely used refractory leukemia cell line and many NK therapy trials focus on leukemias ( Myers and Miller, 2021 37. Myers, J.A. ∙ Miller, J.S. Exploring the NK cell platform for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 18 :85-100 Crossref Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shimasaki et al., 2020 55. Shimasaki, N. ∙ Jain, A. ∙ Campana, D. NK cells for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2020; 19 :200-218 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ). Meanwhile, the widely used HeLa cervical cancer cell line was selected to represent solid cancers. For effector cells, we isolated primary NK cells from leukapheresis samples of healthy donors and named them as “NK#n” with “n” as the order they were used in this study. Since NK cells in peripheral blood of healthy individuals are typically in a resting state, isolated NK cells were pre-activated and expanded with 100 IU/mL interleukin-2 (IL-2), a common method for NK pre-activation ( Fujisaki et al., 2009 14. Fujisaki, H. ∙ Kakuda, H. ∙ Shimasaki, N. ...

James, A.M. ∙ Hsu, H.T. ∙ Dongre, P. ... Rapid activation receptor- or IL-2-induced lytic granule convergence in human natural killer cells requires Src, but not downstream signaling Blood. 2013; 121 :2627-2637 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nayyar et al., 2019 38. Nayyar, G. ∙ Chu, Y. ∙ Cairo, M.S. Overcoming resistance to natural killer cell based immunotherapies for solid tumors Front. Oncol. 2019; 9 :51 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pre-activated NK cells were used between day 3 and day 14 post-isolation. Next, we co-cultured CFSE-labeled cancer cells with pre-activated NK cells at different E:T ratios and time points (see STAR Methods ).
Pre-activated NK cells induced loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential as determined by CMXRos staining ( Figures 1 A, 1M, and S1 C) and rapidly triggered cytochrome c release from mitochondria ( Figures 1 B, 1N, and S1 D), which are the events required for mtApoptosis. NK treatment also quickly activated caspase-3 ( Figures 1 C, 1O, and S1 E) and triggered phosphatidylserine externalization ( Figures 1 D, 1P, and S1 F). NK treatment induced cleavage of BID, caspase-9, -8, -3, and PARP-1 ( Figures 1 E and 1Q) and led to target cells blebbing and formation of apoptotic bodies, which are typical morphological features of apoptosis ( Figures 1 G and 1T). These hallmarks collectively indicate that primary NK cells induced mtApoptosis. NK treatment also readily induced cytochrome c release in all tested blood and solid cancer-cell lines ( Figure S1 G), suggesting that induction of mtApoptosis may be a general mechanism for NK-mediated killing. Of note, NK cells induced cancer-cell mtApoptosis very quickly, which is detectable after a few hours using different methods in different cell lines ( Figures 1 F, 1R, 1S, and S1 H).
Several other forms of programed cell death have been established in the past decade, including necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis ( Shi et al., 2017 54. Shi, J. ∙ Gao, W. ∙ Shao, F.

Weinlich, R. ∙ Oberst, A. ∙ Beere, H.M. ... Necroptosis in development, inflammation and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :127-136 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether these types of cell death also contribute to NK-mediated killing, we pre-treated cancer cells with established inhibitors and then added NK cells. Consistent with an apoptotic form of cell death, the caspase-3 inhibitor zDEVD-fmk or the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk significantly reduced NK killing. In contrast, none of the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1s, the pyroptosis inhibitor dimethyl fumarate (DMF) ( Humphries et al., 2020 20. Humphries, F. ∙ Shmuel-Galia, L. ∙ Ketelut-Carneiro, N. ... Succination inactivates gasdermin D and blocks pyroptosis Science. 2020; 369 :1633-1637 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ), or the ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 and α-tocopherol suppressed NK killing ( Figures 1 H and 1U), suggesting that necroptotic, pyroptotic, and ferroptotic forms of cell death were not involved here. Consistently, most annexin V positive cells retained plasma membrane integrity (AnxV + DAPI − , Figures 1 D and 1M for representative plots), which is lost in necroptotic, pyroptotic, and ferroptotic cells but retained in early apoptotic cells ( Aglietti and Dueber, 2017 1.

Necroptosis in development, inflammation and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :127-136 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also studied if cell-cell contact is dispensable for NK-mediated killing. The Ca 2+ chelator EGTA, which interferes with cytotoxic cell-target cell contact, completely abrogated NK-induced cell death ( Figures 1 I and 1V). Meanwhile, NK-conditioned medium (CM) or NK cells in transwell inserts ( Figures 1 J, 1K, 1W, and 1X) did not induce cancer-cell death, suggesting that cell-cell contact is required for NK killing. NK cells can deliver granzymes or use death ligands to engage target cells and initiate mtApoptosis. We found that neutralizing antibodies targeting death ligands, namely, TNFα, Trail, and FasL, by themselves or in double combinations, did not significantly reduce NK killing. Interestingly, the triple combination slightly but significantly reduced NK killing ( Figure S1 J), suggesting death ligands contribute to NK killing, but to a limited extent. Caspase-8 is a major effector protein downstream of the death ligand signaling. We next used HeLa-caspase-8 knockout cells to further evaluate the contribution of death ligand signaling. Knockout of caspase-8 slightly reduced NK killing, but the reduction is not statistically significant ( Figure S1 K). Taken together, these assays suggest that death ligands did not play a major role. NK treatment robustly induced BID cleavage ( Figures 1 E and 1Q) and cytochrome c release ( Figures 1 B and 1N) in target cells. These observations fit the established paradigm that granzyme B directly cleaves BID ( Lord et al., 2003 31. Lord, S.J. ∙ Rajotte, R.V. ∙ Korbutt, G.S. ... Granzyme B: a natural born killer Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193 :31-38 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ; Waterhouse et al., 2005 63. Waterhouse, N.J. ∙ Sedelies, K.A. ∙ Browne, K.A. ... A central role for Bid in granzyme B-induced apoptosis J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :4476-4482 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that cleaved BID can initiate mtApoptosis ( Letai, 2008 29. Letai, A.G. Diagnosing and exploiting cancer's addiction to blocks in apoptosis Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8 :121-132 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2000 64. Wei, M.C. ∙ Lindsten, T. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... tBID, a membrane-targeted death ligand, oligomerizes BAK to release cytochrome c Genes Dev. 2000; 14 :2060-2071 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In further support, granzyme B knockdown in NK cells ( Figure S1 L) markedly reduced their cytotoxicity on OCI-AML3 and HeLa cells ( Figures 1 L and 1Y). Furthermore, BID knockdown in target cancer cells ( Figure S1 M) made them significantly less sensitive to NK killing ( Figures 1 L and 1Y).
Next, we asked if the mtApoptosis machinery is dispensable for efficient NK killing. To this end, we first used BAX/BAK double knockout (DKO) cells. BAX and BAK are required for the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) that is necessary for mtApoptosis ( Wei et al., 2001 65. Wei, M.C. ∙ Zong, W.X. ∙ Cheng, E.H. ... Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death Science. 2001; 292 :727-730 Crossref Scopus (3445) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first validated that the HeLa DKO cells are indeed mtApoptosis deficient. Although BIM peptide (which inhibits all anti-apoptotic proteins) readily induced cytochrome c release from control (WT) mitochondria, the DKO mitochondria did not respond to BIM peptide ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Next, HeLa WT or DKO cells were seeded, and NK cells were then added at a relatively low E:T ratio of 1:2. Of note, throughout the paper, particular caution was taken to ensure even distribution of both NK and target cells so that at E:T ≤ 1, a single cancer cell was, generally, not engaged simultaneously by two or more NK cells. We found that NK cells induced a time-dependent increase of apoptosis in WT control cells, whereas only a minimal level of apoptosis was seen in DKO ones ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Correspondingly, significantly more DKO cells survived 10-h NK treatment than their WT counterparts ( Figure 2 C).
Next, we examined the effects of E:T ratios on NK-mediated killing. At low E:T ratios such as 1:4 and 1:2, NK cells readily induced apoptosis in WT cells, but only minimal cell death was seen in DKO cells ( Figures 2 D and 2E), suggesting that at low E:T ratios, mtApoptosis machinery is essential for NK killing. However, at E:T = 2:1, while ∼95% WT cells were apoptotic, a substantial fraction (36%) of DKO cells were also apoptotic. Furthermore, at E:T = 4:1, almost all DKO cells were dead ( Figures 2 D and 2E), implying that at high E:T ratios, mtApoptosis may be dispensable for NK killing. Crystal violet staining assays also indicated that at E:T ≤ 1, WT cells were sensitive to both NK samples, whereas DKO cells were resistant ( Figure 2 F). At E:T = 4:1, NK#6, but not NK#8, efficiently killed DKO cells ( Figure 2 F), implying that high E:T ratios were not always capable of overcoming resistance conferred by deficient mtApoptosis machinery. Consistent with the killing data of primary NK cells, two tested NK cell lines KHYG-1 and NK-92MI, at E:T = 1:2, efficiently killed WT control cells, whereas both of them only marginally killed DKO cells. It is known that NK-92MI has stronger cytotoxicity than KHYG-1 cells. At E:T = 2:1, NK-92MI induced substantial apoptosis of DKO cells, whereas the weaker KHYG-1 cells were largely ineffective ( Figures 2 G and S2 E).
We next chose a pair of B cell lymphoma cell lines as target cells and several NK samples selected for different killing ability to study if mtApoptosis is essential for efficient killing by both strong and weak killers. SU-DHL6 has intact mtApoptosis machinery, whereas BBDL does not express BAX and BAK and is thus unable to undergo MOMP and mtApoptosis ( Figures S2 C and S2D). NK#11 and NK#18 were defined as “weak” killers here based on the observation of their relatively weak killing ability, whereas NK#13 and NK-92MI were defined as “strong” killers ( Figure 2 H). At E:T =1:2, neither the weak nor the strong killers could efficiently kill BBDL cells similar to how they killed the paired SU-DHL6 cells ( Figure 2 I). At E:T = 2:1, the strong killers, but not the weak ones, were able to circumvent the mitochondrial deficiency and effectively killed BBDL cells ( Figure 2 I).
Our results using NK cells from eight different donors and two NK cell lines and both blood and solid cancer cells suggest that mtApoptosis pathway is essential for efficient NK killing, especially when NK cells are employed at E:T ratios ≤1. At high E:T ratios, such as 2:1 or 4:1, the “strong” killers, to different extents, circumvented the resistance conferred by mtApoptosis deficiency. However, as aforementioned, such high E:T ratios are probably not physiologically relevant as the endogenous or adoptively transferred NK cells are usually, if not always, outnumbered by cancer cells ( Galon and Bruni, 2019 15. Galon, J. ∙ Bruni, D. Approaches to treat immune hot, altered and cold tumours with combination immunotherapies Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18 :197-218 Crossref Scopus (1913) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shimasaki et al., 2020 55. Shimasaki, N. ∙ Jain, A. ∙ Campana, D. NK cells for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2020; 19 :200-218 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We have shown that mtApoptosis is essential for efficient NK killing using binary live/dead assays. It has been postulated that effector-target cell contacts are mostly sublethal rather than “live/death” binary events, and the sublethal damage can accumulate by subsequent contacts to eventually kill cancers ( Beck et al., 2020 5.

Commun. 2021; 12 :5217 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). If true, we reasoned that the sublethal contacts might push cancer cells toward apoptotic threshold (i.e., prime cancer cells for mtApoptosis) before killing them by subsequent contacts. We investigated this question using BH3 profiling ( Figures 3 A–3C). BH3 profiling was developed as a tool to integrate the interactions among 21 known BCL-2 family proteins ( Montero et al., 2015 35. Montero, J. ∙ Sarosiek, K.A. ∙ DeAngelo, J.D. ...

There are two types of synthetic 20-mer BH3 peptides used in BH3 profiling. Promiscuous peptides, such as BIM peptide, measure overall “priming” (cell proximity to its apoptotic threshold), whereas selective BH3 peptides can determine selective dependence on anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, or BFL-1, for survival. The more sensitive mitochondria are to BH3 peptides, the more “primed” or “dependent” they are. Specifically, the 20-mer BH3 peptides are derived and modified from the BH3 domains of BH3-only proteins, which can dock into the hydrophobic grooves of anti-apoptotic proteins. The BIM-derived peptide binds to all anti-apoptotic proteins; therefore, it measures overall “mitochondrial priming.” The other BH3 peptides that were used have a more selective binding pattern ( Figure 3 A; Certo et al., 2006 7. Certo, M. ∙ Del Gaizo Moore, V. ∙ Nishino, M. ... Mitochondria primed by death signals determine cellular addiction to antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members Cancer Cell. 2006; 9 :351-365 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1048) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, MS-1 peptide only binds to MCL-1, and thus a response from MS-1 peptide indicates a dependence on MCL-1. Similarly, the HRK peptide only binds BCL-XL, and FS-1 peptide only binds BFL-1. BAD peptide binds BCL-2 and BCL-XL. When it is used in parallel with BCL-XL selective HRK peptide and BCL-2 selective compound ABT-199, the specific anti-apoptotic dependence can be elucidated. Therefore, selective BH3 peptides determine on which anti-apoptotic proteins cells depend for survival.
We co-cultured NK cells with cancer cells at an E:T ratio of 1:2 for 2 h—a pre-determined condition where 80%–90% cancer cells were alive—and performed BH3 profiling on gated viable cells. As shown in Figures 3 D and 3E, NK treatment markedly increased the overall mitochondrial priming and anti-apoptotic dependence of surviving cells, as measured by the promiscuous and selective peptides. Next, we focused on BH3 profiling with only BIM peptide to examine the changes of overall priming using more cell lines. Both NK samples effectively increased overall priming of 3/3 blood cancer cell lines ( Figure 3 F). Similarly, the two NK samples also effectively primed 3/3 solid cancer cell lines ( Figure 3 G). Of note, the blood cancer cells appeared to be more easily primed by NK cells than the solid ones ( Figures 3 F–3H), consistent with the observation that NK therapies are generally more efficacious in blood malignancies. We also examined the priming status of co-cultured cancer cells over time. At all tested time points, surviving cancer cells as a population were more primed for mtApoptosis than untreated controls ( Figure 3 I). Interestingly, NK-induced priming was lower at later time points than at 2 h. This may be explained by the fast-killing dynamics of NK cells. Killed cancer cells have been lost to assay at later time points. The profiled membrane-intact remaining cells have thus been selected for relative resistance to being primed by NK cells. Note that direct cell-cell contact appeared to be required for NK-mediated priming as NK CM did not prime cancer cells ( Figure S3 ). Also, in the presence of EGTA, which impairs NK-target cell contacts, NK-induced priming was abrogated ( Figure S3 ).
Recently, several publications suggested that multiple contacts were needed for majority of killing by cytotoxic cells ( Beck et al., 2020 5. Beck, R.J. ∙ Bijker, D.I. ∙ Beltman, J.B. Heterogeneous, delayed-onset killing by multiple-hitting T cells: stochastic simulations to assess methods for analysis of imaging data PLoS Comput. Biol. 2020; 16 e1007972 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Halle et al., 2016 18. Halle, S. ∙ Keyser, K.A. ∙ Stahl, F.R. ... In vivo killing capacity of cytotoxic T cells is limited and involves dynamic interactions and T cell cooperativity Immunity. 2016; 44 :233-245 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weigelin et al., 2020 66. Weigelin, B. ∙ den Boer, A.T. ∙ Wagena, E. ... Cancer cell elimination by cytotoxic T cell cooperation and additive damage Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Our results that NK treatment could prime cancer cells for mtApoptosis in a graded fashion provide an explanation for the additive cytotoxicity of serial cytotoxic cell contacts. We consequently postulated that additional agents that prime cancer cells (e.g., BH3 mimetics) might complement NK-induced priming to synergistically push cancer cells across apoptosis threshold and augment NK-mediated killing (investigated in the coming results).
Upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, especially BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1, has been widely implicated in drug resistance to chemo- and targeted therapies ( Ashkenazi et al., 2017 2. Ashkenazi, A. ∙ Fairbrother, W.J. ∙ Leverson, J.D. ... From basic apoptosis discoveries to advanced selective BCL-2 family inhibitors Nat. Rev.

Singh, R. ∙ Letai, A. ∙ Sarosiek, K. Regulation of apoptosis in health and disease: the balancing act of BCL-2 family proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :175-193 Crossref Scopus (1188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, we investigated how overexpression of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 affects cancer-cell-priming status and their susceptibility to NK cells.
BH3 profiling with the BIM peptide indicated that BCL-2 overexpression ( Figure 4 D) considerably reduced the overall priming status of HL-60 cells ( Figure 4 A, black bars). Next, we co-cultured the BCL-2 overexpressors with both the relatively weak NK#10 and relatively strong NK#11 at two E:T ratios and two time points. Unexceptionally, the BCL-2 overexpressors became less susceptible to NK-mediated killing ( Figure 4 F). Overexpression of BCL-XL also significantly decreased overall mitochondrial priming ( Figure 4 B, black bars). As expected, NK cells were less efficacious against BCL-XL overexpressors ( Figure 4 G). Similarly, MCL-1 overexpression significantly diminished mitochondrial priming ( Figure 4 C, black bars) and reduced killing by both the weak and strong killers at all tested conditions ( Figure 4 H). These results suggest that reduced priming makes cancer cells less susceptible to NK killing.
We also used selective BH3 peptides to determine the changes in anti-apoptotic dependence ( Figures 3 A–3C). We speculated that changes of dependence on individual anti-apoptotic proteins affect cell sensitivity to corresponding BH3 mimetics, but only the overall priming status matters when it comes to cancer susceptibility to NK cells. Note that the BH3 mimetics that are used throughout the paper are BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax, BCL-2i), MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 (MCL-1i), and BCL-XL inhibitor A-1331852 (BCL-XLi), all of which have been further validated by us as highly specific bona fide BH3 mimetics ( Villalobos-Ortiz et al., 2020 60. Villalobos-Ortiz, M. ∙ Ryan, J. ∙ Mashaka, T.N. ... BH3 profiling discriminates on-target small molecule BH3 mimetics from putative mimetics Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27 :999-1007 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). As determined by BH3 profiling, BCL-2 overexpression rendered the cells solely dependent on BCL-2 ( Figure 4 A, middle panel). Consistently, BCL-2 overexpressors only responded to BCL-2i but not to MCL-1i as the control cells did ( Figure 4 I). BCL-XL overexpressors became more dependent on BCL-XL and less dependent on BCL-2 and MCL-1 ( Figure 4 B). Consequently, the BCL-XL overexpressors gained sensitivity to BCL-XLi and acquired resistance to BCL-2i or MCL-1i ( Figure 4 J). Similarly, MCL-1 overexpressors became more dependent on MCL-1 ( Figure 4 C) and thus less sensitive to BCL2i but retained sensitivity to MCL-1i ( Figure 4 K).
Indeed, shifts of anti-apoptotic dependence could serve as good indicators of changes of cell sensitivity to selective BH3 mimetics. Nonetheless, it did not imply changes of cell sensitivity to NK cells. Instead, decreased overall mitochondrial priming consistently accompanied reduced sensitivity to NK cells. This also stayed true for cytarabine and etoposide ( Figures 4 I–4K), two widely used genotoxic therapeutics known to induce mtApoptosis. Though the initial targets of NK cells and genotoxic reagents are quite different, it appears that mitochondrial priming status affects their efficacy in a similar fashion.
BH3 mimetics are arguably the most direct and efficient compounds for priming cancer cells for mtApoptosis. We postulated that BH3 mimetics might significantly synergize with NK cells in pushing cancer cells across apoptotic thresholds but on the premise that NK cells could tolerate combined BH3 mimetics. Unfortunately, the gated CD3 − CD56 + NK population in four peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were sensitive to BCL-2i/BCL-XLi/MCL-1i ( Figures 5 A, S4 A, and S4B). Of note, NK cells in peripheral blood of healthy donors are typically in a resting state. For adoptive transfer, NK cells are generally pre-activated with IL-2 to enhance their functionality ( Fujisaki et al., 2009 14. Fujisaki, H. ∙ Kakuda, H. ∙ Shimasaki, N. ... Expansion of highly cytotoxic human natural killer cells for cancer cell therapy Cancer Res. 2009; 69 :4010-4017 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ; James et al., 2013 22. James, A.M. ∙ Hsu, H.T. ∙ Dongre, P. ... Rapid activation receptor- or IL-2-induced lytic granule convergence in human natural killer cells requires Src, but not downstream signaling Blood. 2013; 121 :2627-2637 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shimasaki et al., 2020 55. Shimasaki, N. ∙ Jain, A. ∙ Campana, D. NK cells for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2020; 19 :200-218 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next pre-activated isolated NK cells and found that all tested NK samples markedly increased their expression of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 after pre-activation ( Figure 5 B). But interestingly, the pro-apoptotic proteins such as BIM, BAX, and BAK were upregulated as well. In addition, caspase-9 expression was elevated in 3/3 samples, whereas caspase-3 level was reduced in 2/3 samples and increased in 1/3 sample ( Figure 5 B). The increase of both anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins made it difficult to infer whether the pre-activated cells were more or less primed for mtApoptosis based on protein expression alone.
We therefore performed BH3 profiling using the BIM peptide and found that, surprisingly, 4/4 pre-activated NK samples all became significantly less primed for mtApoptosis ( Figure 5 C), suggesting that pre-activation pushed NK cells away from their apoptotic thresholds. These unexpected findings promoted us to compare the sensitivity of resting and pre-activated NK cells with BH3 mimetics. We first treated three pairs of NK samples with BCL-2i ABT-199 for 24 h and used 20% apoptosis (IC 20 ) as a cutoff for considerable toxicity. The IC 20 s of pre-activated NK cells from all three donors dramatically increased from <50 nM to >4,000 nM ( Figure 5 D). Next, we treated pre-activated NK cells for up to 96 h and enumerated the numbers of viable cells. There was no significant difference between 24 and 96 h ( Figure 5 E), and the percentage of apoptosis also remained low at 96 h ( Figure S4 C). We further examined the effects of BCL-2i at NK mitochondrial level. BCL-2i markedly increased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (ΔΨm) and induced cytochrome c release in resting NK cells, but not in pre-activated NK cells ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Taken together, pre-activated NK cells acquired resistance to BCL-2i at both the cellular and mitochondrial levels. Note that the pre-activated NK cells (day 5) have higher background cell death than freshly isolated resting NK cells ( Figure 5 G), which is likely caused by prolonged ex vivo culture, as without IL-2 pre-activation, NK cells were mostly dead after 5 days and thus unsuitable for cell death studies.
We next examined if pre-activation also conferred NK cells resistance to BCL-XLi or MCL-1i. Compared with resting NK cells, BCL-XLi IC 20 s of pre-activated cells increased from <10 nM to >4,000 nM and the MCL-1i IC 20 s increased from ∼100 nM to >1,000 nM ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Interestingly, pre-activated NK cells upregulated XIAP and became extremely sensitive to XIAP inhibition ( Figures 5 B and 5J), suggesting that special precaution needs to be taken when considering combining IAP inhibitors with NK therapies. Note that the chosen BH3 mimetics were able to effectively prime tumor cells at low nM range ( Figure S4 D). Given the acquired resistance of pre-activated NK cells to BH3 mimetics, a wide therapeutic window may exist for augmenting NK-based therapies with BH3 mimetics.
Having shown that the effects of NK cells and BH3 mimetics converge on mtApoptosis and that pre-activated NK cells can tolerate BH3 mimetics, we next tested if NK cells and BH3 mimetics would synergize in killing cancer cells and if BH3 profiling could predict which mimetic is the ideal one to be combined. BH3 profiling suggested that HeLa cells had anti-apoptotic dependence on MCL-1 ( Figure 6 A). We thus predicted that MCL-1i, but not BCL-2i or BCL-XLi, would synergize with NK cells in priming and killing HeLa cells. Indeed, only MCL-1i significantly augmented NK-induced priming of HeLa cells, whereas BCL-2i or BCL-XLi did not ( Figure 6 B). Furthermore, as predicted, MCL-1i synergized with NK cells in killing HeLa cells, whereas BCL-2i or BCL-XLi did not ( Figure 6 C).
We next selected HL60-BCL2, a blood cancer cell line with an anti-apoptotic dependence distinct from HeLa cells ( Figure 6 D), to further examine our hypothesis. BH3 profiling indicated that it is a BCL-2-dependent cell line. We predicted that BCL-2i, but not BCL-XLi or MCL-1i, would synergize with NK cells in priming and in killing HL60-BCL2 cells. As expected, only BCL-2i triggered a significant increase of delta priming ( Figure 6 E), and only BCL-2i augmented NK-induced priming ( Figure 6 E). More importantly, BCL-2i synergized with NK cells in killing target cells, whereas the other two combinations had no synergy at all ( Figure 6 F).
We have shown that HL60-BCLXL and OCI-AML3-MCL1 cells, respectively, depend on BCL-XL and MCL-1 for survival. As speculated, BCL-XLi and NK cells synergistically induced apoptosis in the BCL-XL-dependent cells ( Figure 6 G). Similarly, MCL-1i synergized with NK cells in killing OCI-AML3-MCL1 cells ( Figure 6 H).
Of note, BH3 mimetics do not upregulate stress-inducible ligands such as MICA and MICB in malignant or non-transformed cells ( Figures S5 A and S5B). We also explored the combined effects on non-transformed cells. BCL-2 inhibitor did not increase NK killing of endothelial, macrophage, and fibroblast cells ( Figure S5 C). The MCL-1 or BCL-XL antagonists slightly or moderately increased NK killing of endothelial cells and macrophages but not fibroblast cells ( Figures S5 D and S5E). Of note, NK cells by itself can kill ex vivo expanded non-transformed cells, though to a much lesser extent than they can kill malignant cells. This is not unexpected because these non-transformed cells had gone through extended ex vivo culture, which could stress them to upregulate stress-inducible ligands, thus being different from in situ “unstressed” cells, which likely do not trigger NK killing. Consistent with this postulation, adoptive transfer of pre-activated NK cells has demonstrated a good safety profile in clinical trials ( Miller et al., 2005 33. Miller, J.S. ∙ Soignier, Y. ∙ Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A. ...

Effectiveness of donor natural killer cell alloreactivity in mismatched hematopoietic transplants Science. 2002; 295 :2097-2100 Crossref Scopus (2836) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A common strategy to augment NK killing is to use antibodies such as rituximab and cetuximab to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of NK cells. We also performed exploratory experiments to examine whether CD20-targeting rituximab or EGFR-targeting cetuximab affects tumor cell priming for mtApoptosis. We found that rituximab treatment significantly increased mitochondrial priming of CD20 + SU-DHL4 and SU-DHL6 cells ( Figure S6 A). Cetuximab significantly increased priming status of EGFR + HeLa cells but not of MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure S6 B). We postulate that the increased mitochondrial priming may also contribute to the widely reported synergy between the two ADCC-inducing agents and NK cells ( Baysal et al., 2020 4.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13 :1552-1561 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the treatment of certain types of cancers. We found that PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab did not change the priming status of HeLa and OCI-AML3 cells, the two representative cell lines used in this study ( Figures S6 D and S6E). We also examined a panel of 14 cancer cell lines and found that none of them express PD-1 or CTLA-4 ( Figure S6 F), which is not surprising since PD-1 or CTLA-4 are receptor proteins generally expressed and studied in immune cells. Among the 14 profiled cell lines, breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and lung cancer cell lines H1975 and H460 express PD-L1 ( Figures S6 G and S6H). PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab did not change the mitochondrial priming of the three PD-L1 + cell lines ( Figure S6 I). In summary, we found that although some therapeutic antibodies may well enhance killing by NK cells via inducing ADCC, an additional mechanism, through enhanced mitochondrial priming of the target cancer cells, might also contribute.
Taken together, BH3 mimetics were able to synergize with NK cells in both priming and killing cancer cells. Our previous work showed that BH3 profiling predicted cancer response to different drugs in vitro , in vivo , and in the clinic ( Letai, 2017 28. Letai, A.

Selective BCL-2 inhibition by ABT-199 causes on-target cell death in acute myeloid leukemia Cancer Discov. 2014; 4 :362-375 Crossref Scopus (542) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we performed BH3 profiling experiments in the context of immunotherapy and demonstrated that synergy between NK cells and BH3 mimetics can be predicted by BH3 profiling as well.
Next, we investigated if BH3 mimetics would synergize with adoptively transferred NK cells in vivo and if BH3 profiling could predict the combined effects. For the first mouse model, we subcutaneously injected HL60-BCL2 cells into NOD SCID gamma (NSG) immunodeficient mice. After mice developed palpable tumors, they were randomly assigned into six groups and treated with regimens as detailed in Figure 7 A. Based on the BH3 profiling results that the injected cells are highly dependent on BCL-2 ( Figure 6 D), we predicted that BCL-2i, but not MCL-1i, would synergize with NK cells in vivo . Indeed, BCL-2i synergized with NK cells in priming engrafted cells in vivo , as determined by ex vivo BH3 profiling assays ( Figure 7 B). Consistently, NK cells or BCL-2i alone moderately suppressed tumor growth, whereas the combination reduced tumor burden to a significantly greater extent ( Figure 7 C). NK cells or BCL-2i monotherapy prolonged mouse median survival by 3 or 4 days, whereas the combination synergistically extended survival by 16 days ( Figure 7 D) in this highly aggressive model, where 0.5 million injected cells could form tumors >2,000 mm 3 (the endpoint) within 2 weeks. In contrast, MCL-1i, which was predicted to be non-synergistic but nevertheless included as a “negative” control, synergized with NK cells neither in reducing tumor burden nor in prolonging mouse survival ( Figure 7 D).
The second in vivo model we chose is the HeLa-NSG xenograft mouse model ( Figure 7 E). This model was selected because BH3 profiling suggested that HeLa cells are dependent on MCL-1 rather than BCL-2 for survival ( Figure 6 A), thus offering a useful contrast to the first model. We thus predicted that NK cells would synergize with MCL-1i, but not BCL-2i, in this model. Indeed, MCL-1i significantly synergized with NK cells in priming engrafted HeLa cells ( Figure 7 F). Furthermore, both MCL-1i and NK cells suppressed tumor growth, but the combination reduced tumor volume significantly greater than either treatment alone. In contrast, BCL-2i, which had been predicted to be non-synergistic by BH3 profiling, was largely ineffective by itself and did not augment NK-mediated tumor suppression ( Figures 7 G and 7H).
Taken together, using a blood and a solid tumor xenograft model, each with different anti-apoptotic dependencies, we demonstrated that BH3 mimetics synergized with NK cells in vivo and that BH3 profiling predicted if a given BH3 mimetic would synergize with adoptive NK cells. In summary, increasing apoptotic priming in target cancer cells with rationally chosen BH3 mimetics augmented efficacy of NK cells both in vitro and in vivo .
Though the current study centered around NK cells, we also performed some exploratory proof-of-concept experiments using T cells. Both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells form immunological synapses to deliver granzymes or use death ligands to initiate killing of cancer cells ( Morvan and Lanier, 2016 36. Morvan, M.G. ∙ Lanier, L.L. NK cells and cancer: you can teach innate cells new tricks Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :7-19 Crossref Scopus (841) PubMed Google Scholar ; Waldman et al., 2020 62.

Immunol. 2020; 20 :651-668 Crossref Scopus (2073) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given this similarity, mtApoptosis may also play an essential role in T cell-mediated killing, and, if so, BH3 mimetics may synergize with T cells as well but again on the premise that T cells could tolerate BH3 mimetics. TCR-, TIL-, and CAR-T cells for adoptive T cell transfer are generally generated from pre-activated T cells ( June et al., 2018 23. June, C.H. ∙ O'Connor, R.S. ∙ Kawalekar, O.U. ... CAR T cell immunotherapy for human cancer Science. 2018; 359 :1361-1365 Crossref Scopus (1857) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rosenberg and Restifo, 2015 48. Rosenberg, S.A. ∙ Restifo, N.P. Adoptive cell transfer as personalized immunotherapy for human cancer Science. 2015; 348 :62-68 Crossref Scopus (1782) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that pre-activation with IL-2 and CD3/CD28 Dynabeads rendered CD8 + cytotoxic T cells resistant to BCL-2i and MCL-1i ( Figure S7 A), similarly as we observed in pre-activated NK cells. The acquired resistance opens the possibility to combine these BH3 mimetics with adoptive T cells. We transduced CD8 + T cells with TCR specific for NY-ESO-1 antigen ( Rapoport et al., 2015 43. Rapoport, A.P. ∙ Stadtmauer, E.A. ∙ Binder-Scholl, G.K. ... NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-engineered T cells mediate sustained antigen-specific antitumor effects in myeloma Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :914-921 Crossref Scopus (675) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that the TCR-T cells effectively primed NY-ESO-1-expressing cancer cells for mtApoptosis ( Figure S7 B). Furthermore, as speculated, TCR-T cells significantly synergized with BCL-2i and MCL-1i in inducing target cell apoptosis and in reducing the number of target cells ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Based on these proof-of-concept experiments, we postulated that the strategy of targeting mtApoptosis to augment NK killing may be adaptable to adoptive T cell therapies as well.

Section: Discussion

Our results, using different models, indicate that mtApoptosis deficiency made cells resistant to efficient NK killing. This was true for both “weak” and “strong” NK killers when used at E:T ≤ 1:1. Mitochondria thus appear to be essential amplifiers for the death signal delivered by NK cells. Recent reports suggested that cytotoxic cell contacts are, generally, not binary “live/death” events ( Beck et al., 2020 5. Beck, R.J. ∙ Bijker, D.I. ∙ Beltman, J.B.

Weigelin, B. ∙ den Boer, A.T. ∙ Wagena, E. ... Cancer cell elimination by cytotoxic T cell cooperation and additive damage Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). On the contrary, most contacts are sublethal and the incurred damage can accumulate to lethal levels by subsequent contacts over time. For example, Halle et al. observed that the probability of target cell death after a single cytotoxic cell contact was ∼15%, whereas that increased to >80% after three or more contacts. Using different models, Weigelin et al. demonstrated that apoptotic events were often proceeded by multiple cytotoxic T cell contacts. Furthermore, the sublethal damage in the plasma/nuclear membrane and in DNA integrity resembled damages induced by chemical assaults, which were also incremental and can be repaired if given time ( Callen et al., 2013 6.

Weigelin, B. ∙ den Boer, A.T. ∙ Wagena, E. ... Cancer cell elimination by cytotoxic T cell cooperation and additive damage Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Our observation of increased apoptotic priming following NK treatment ( Figure 3 ) offers an explanation for the additive cytotoxicity of serial NK encounters. We postulate that at low E:T ratios, the NK-target cell contacts happen less often, and the sublethal damage needs to be amplified by mitochondria to push cancer cells beyond their apoptotic thresholds. This amplifier function seems only dispensable when “strong” killers are used at high E:T ratios (e.g., 2:1 and 4:1) where BAX/BAK DKO cells are effectively killed. For “weak” NK killers, even when used at high E:T ratios, it seems that the accumulated death signal still does not suffice and needs to be amplified by mitochondria. Consequently, “weak killers” are largely ineffective against BAX/BAK DKO cells.
However, when cancer cells are pushed closer to apoptotic thresholds (primed) by BH3 mimetics, less-powerful hits from “weak” killers or less-frequent NK punches due to low E:T ratios may become sufficient to push cancer cells across apoptotic thresholds. This may explain why BH3 mimetics—even when used at low nM concentrations, they could prime cancer cells ( Figure S4 D) but barely kill them as single agents ( Figures 6 F–6H)—almost always sensitized cancer cells to NK-mediated killing. The strategy of priming cancer cells with BH3 mimetics could make them easier targets for NK cells, thus potentially accelerating NK-mediated killing. In light of the short lifespan and persistence of adoptively transferred NK cells ( Lutz et al., 2011 32. Lutz, C.T. ∙ Karapetyan, A. ∙ Al-Attar, A. ... Human NK cells proliferate and die in vivo more rapidly than T cells in healthy young and elderly adults J.

NKAML: a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of haploidentical natural killer cell transplantation in childhood acute myeloid leukemia J. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 28 :955-959 Crossref Scopus (522) PubMed Google Scholar ), a strategy to accelerate NK killing and augment their anti-tumor efficacy is particularly relevant.
We have demonstrated that combining BH3 mimetics offer synergistic benefit to NK cell therapy in vitro and in vivo . If this concept is taken into the clinic, it is beneficial to first determine the anti-apoptotic dependence of patient cancer cells. For cancers with known dependence (e.g., chronic lymphoid leukemias are highly dependent on BCL-2 ( Del Gaizo Moore et al., 2007 11. Del Gaizo Moore, V. ∙ Brown, J.R. ∙ Certo, M. ... Chronic lymphocytic leukemia requires BCL2 to sequester prodeath BIM, explaining sensitivity to BCL2 antagonist ABT-737 J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117 :112-121 Crossref Scopus (542) PubMed Google Scholar ; Letai, 2008 29. Letai, A.G. Diagnosing and exploiting cancer's addiction to blocks in apoptosis Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8 :121-132 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar )), it is logical to combine the corresponding BH3 mimetic with NK cells—in this case, a BCL-2i. For cancers without a consistent dependence, BH3 profiling can be used to determine the baseline dependence and/or BH3 mimetic-induced priming of patient cells, in an assay that typically takes a few hours and does not require extended ex vivo culture. In the era of precision medicine, BH3 profiling may help rationally assign individual patients to a BH3 mimetic-NK combination that potentially benefits them the most.
In addition to BH3 mimetics, many other chemo- and targeted therapeutics kill cancer cells by inducing mtApoptosis ( Ashkenazi et al., 2017 2. Ashkenazi, A. ∙ Fairbrother, W.J. ∙ Leverson, J.D. ... From basic apoptosis discoveries to advanced selective BCL-2 family inhibitors Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017; 16 :273-284 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hata et al., 2015 19.

Diagnosing and exploiting cancer's addiction to blocks in apoptosis Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8 :121-132 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ; Singh et al., 2019 56. Singh, R. ∙ Letai, A. ∙ Sarosiek, K. Regulation of apoptosis in health and disease: the balancing act of BCL-2 family proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :175-193 Crossref Scopus (1188) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is plausible to reason that when properly selected, such right agent might potentially sensitize tumor cells to NK-mediated killing, provided the combined compounds can be well tolerated by NK cells. We have demonstrated that pre-activated NK cells became less primed for mtApoptosis. They are thus likely capable of tolerating higher doses of mtApoptosis-inducing agents, thus opening the possibility of more combination options. Moreover, certain combinatorial strategies might offer additional benefits. In addition to making malignant cells easier kills for NK cells, some therapeutics (e.g., genotoxic agents) can upregulate germline-encoded ligands on cancer cells and facilitate target recognition by activation receptors on NK cells ( Huntington et al., 2020 21. Huntington, N.D. ∙ Cursons, J. ∙ Rautela, J. The cancer-natural killer cell immunity cycle Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2020; 20 :437-454 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raulet and Guerra, 2009 44. Raulet, D.H. ∙ Guerra, N. Oncogenic stress sensed by the immune system: role of natural killer cell receptors Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9 :568-580 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus leading to a more robust NK response.
In summary, strategies to augment NK-based therapies are much needed. Herein, we report that mtApoptosis machinery is essential for efficient NK killing and proposed targeting mtApoptosis to enhance NK anti-tumor efficacy. Using multiple in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated that BH3 mimetics and NK cells markedly synergized in killing cancer cells and BH3 profiling can be utilized to rationally select BH3 mimetics to be combined with NK cells. Our results may serve as the basis for future clinical trials testing the combinations of NK cells with BH3 mimetics. Furthermore, as demonstrated by our exploratory experiments, this approach may be adaptable to T cell-based immunotherapies as well. Taken together, we proposed a rational strategy to sensitize cancer cells to cytotoxic cell-mediated killing and a therapeutic avenue to be tested both in laboratories and in the clinic.
The employed mouse models utilized immunodeficient mice, human cancer cells, and human NK cells. We had considered using the combination of immunocompetent mice and syngeneic murine cancer and NK cells. However, there are practical issues that render such a model less productive to evaluate adoptive NK therapy. Laboratory mice are inbred so that each strain is homozygous and has a unique MHC haplotype. When using NK cells from the same strain, the inhibitory effects from self-MHC recognition, inefficient stimulation of NK cells by syngeneic tumor cells, development of resistance to “autologous” NK cells after tumor engraftment, and complications from endogenous T, B, and NK cells made this experimental model inconclusive. Actually, almost all current adoptive NK transfer trials use allogenic NK cells because autologous NK cells failed to produce significant therapeutic effects ( Bald et al., 2020 3. Bald, T. ∙ Krummel, M.F. ∙ Smyth, M.J. ... The NK cell-cancer cycle: advances and new challenges in NK cell-based immunotherapies Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :835-847 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ; Myers and Miller, 2021 37. Myers, J.A. ∙ Miller, J.S. Exploring the NK cell platform for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 18 :85-100 Crossref Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ruggeri et al., 2002 50. Ruggeri, L. ∙ Capanni, M. ∙ Urbani, E. ... Effectiveness of donor natural killer cell alloreactivity in mismatched hematopoietic transplants Science. 2002; 295 :2097-2100 Crossref Scopus (2836) PubMed Google Scholar ). We had also considered injecting allogeneic NK cells from a different murine strain into immunocompetent mice. However, there is a major concern with host rejection by host T and B cell alloimmune responses, leading to clearance of allogenic NK cells. In fact, this is why nearly all allogeneic NK transfer requires chemical immunosuppression of the recipients. After taking these issues into consideration, we used the combination of immunodeficient mice + human tumor cells + allogenic human NK cells. But there are limitations associated with this type of mouse models. In the clinic, pre-conditioning before allogenic NK transfer ablated recipients’ T, B, and NK cells, etc., but there are still other immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory cells remaining in the tumor stroma. There might be unexpected interactions between those cells and the BH3-mimetics, which could not be investigated by the employed mouse models. For example, the models that we employed are not ideal to study whether the combination would cause CRS because this effect depends on a complicated immunological milieu that is likely not present in these models. In addition, the contribution of cytokines released by human NK cells might be underestimated due to their attenuated interaction with murine receptors in the host. Although adoptively transferred NK cells by itself have been shown not to induce CRS, this possibility cannot be excluded when they are used in conjunction with BH3 mimetics. This question may be systematically investigated in the clinic or using primate models to better mimic the clinical situations in follow-up studies.

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
Cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) or Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany) and maintained according to the vendors’ instructions. HL-60 cell lines with stable overexpression of BCL-2 or BCL-XL and the control cell line were kindly provided by Dr. Kapil N. Bhalla (UT MD Anderson Cancer Center). Human caspase-8 knockout HeLa cell line was ordered from Abcam. All cell lines were mycoplasma free, as tested by PCR Mycoplasma Detection Kit (#G238, Applied Biological Materials). Cell lines were validated by short tandem repeat DNA fingerprinting using the AmpFlSTR Identifier kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Exponentially growing cells with viability greater than 95% were used for all in vitro and in vivo studies.
Animal experiments were performed after approval from the Dana-Farber Cancer Center Committee on Use and Care of Animals and were conducted as per NIH guidelines for animal welfare. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines at Dana-Farber cancer institute animal facility (IACUC protocol#14-038). Animals were housed and cared according to standard guidelines with free access to water and food. All mouse experiments were performed on 6-8 weeks old, female NOD SCID gamma (NSG) female mice (Jackson labs stock#005557). Animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups.
Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated from healthy blood donor leukapheresis collars. All human samples were deidentified, discarded clinical material and their use was approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University human studies review boards. Primary Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells were ordered from ATCC and cultured according to the vendors’ instructions.
Cells were lysed at a density of 1 x 10 6 /50 μL in lysis buffer (0.25 M Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecylsulfate, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) supplemented with 1 X protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (#5872, Cell Signaling Technology). Cell lysates were then loaded onto polyacrylamide gels with sodium dodecyl sulfate (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The transblotted membranes were blocked for 1 hr and then probed with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Next day, the membranes were washed three times for a total of 30 min and then incubated with IRDye® 680RD Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) or IRDye® 800CW Donkey anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (Li-COR Biosciences) in darkness at room temperature for 1 h. After another three washes, Odyssey infrared imaging system and companion software (LI-COR Biosciences) were used to scan immunoblot membranes and to quantify band intensity according to the manufacturer’s manual. Please refer to the key resources table for providers of all primary or secondary antibodies.
Human NK cells were isolated from fresh leukapheresis blood collars (< 6 h after collection) from healthy donors that were generated by Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Boston. Samples were diluted with an equal volume of PBS, and PBMC cells were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Isolated cells were washed twice with PBS, and NK cells were then isolated by negative selection using the EasySep™ Human NK Cell Isolation Kit (#17955, StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Enriched resting NK cells (purity > 90%) were then cultured with RPMI medium supplemented with 5 mM Hepes, 2 mM Glutamax, 50 μg/ml Pen/Strep, 5 mM NEAA, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, 9% certified heat-inactivated FBS, 1% human A/B serum, as well as 50 μM freshly-added beta-mercaptoethanol. To pre-activate and expand the isolated resting NK cells, the medium was also supplemented with 100 IU/mL of recombinant human IL-2 (Peprotech). Half of the IL-2 containing medium was replaced with fresh medium three times a week. The cell density was kept between 1-3 million/mL and fresh complete medium was added to dilute the cell culture when necessary. Primary NK cells were pre-activated for three days before they were used in killing assays and were used within 2 weeks (day 3 to day 14) after isolation.
Exponentially growing adherent cells were trypsinized and then labelled with CFSE (Abcam) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were next resuspended in pre-warmed culture medium and plated in flat-bottom 96-well plates (30,000 cells/100 μL/well). Of note, to achieve even distribution of the plated cells, vibration and agitation should be minimized especially before cells settle down and attach. Cells were cultured in low vibration incubator for 3 hours. The medium was then aspirated off with caution and replaced with 100 μL medium with different compounds, with or without NK cells at indicated E:T ratios. Again, vibration and agitation should be minimized before NK cells settle down. The cells were next co-cultured for indicated time in incubator with low vibration. After incubation, the supernatant was transferred to a 96 well flat-bottom plate with non-binding surface. The remaining attached cells were then washed with PBS, trypsinized, and combined with the supernatant. 20 μL of 10X annexin V binding buffer (100 mM HEPES, 40 mM KCl, 1.4 M NaCl, 7,5 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.4) with annexin V–Alexa647 and 20 μM/mL DAPI was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Next, the plates were placed on ice and analyzed immediately with BD Fortessa flow cytometer with a high-throughput module.
For non-adherent cells, CFSE-labeled cancer cells were mixed with NK cells at different E:T ratios and the final concentration for cancer cells is 0.5 million/mL. Then 100 μL cell mixture was dispensed into 96-well plates pre-loaded with 100 μL medium supplemented with 2X final concentrations of different drugs. Vibration and agitation should be avoided to allow cancer cells and NK cells settle down evenly on the bottom. The cells were next incubated for indicated time in incubator with low vibration. The cells were then stained and analyzed as described above for adherent cells.
Cancer, NK, or T cells were treated with different compounds or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as indicated in the figures and figure legends. DMSO served as the drug vehicle, and its final concentration was no more than 0.1%. After treatment, cells were collected, stained with annexin V and DAPI, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, 10X annexin V binding buffer (100 mM HEPES, 40 mM KCl, 1.4 M NaCl, 7,5 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.4) with fluorochrome-conjugated annexin V and 20 μM/mL DAPI was added and incubated at RT for 15 min. Next, the plates were placed on ice and analyzed immediately with BD Fortessa flow cytometer. To determine absolute cell number, CountBright Absolute Counting Beads (Life Technologies) were also added. Data were analyzed by BD FACSDiva™ Software (BD Biosciences) and Flowjo software v10 (Flowjo). Calcusyn 2.0 software (Biosoft) was used to calculate combination index and whether there is a synergy, based on the number of live cells (i.e., AnxV − /DAPI − ). The percentage of specific apoptosis was calculated as follows: 100 × (experimental apoptosis % – spontaneous apoptosis %)/(100 % – spontaneous apoptosis %).
Adherent cells were labelled with CFSE and next resuspended in pre-warmed culture medium in T75 flask. Cells were cultured for 3 hours to allow them to attach evenly (For non-adherent cells, this step can be skipped). Compounds were then added followed by addition of NK cells. The cells were then incubated for indicated time in incubator with low vibration. After incubation, the supernatant and the attached cells from one flask were harvested into the same tube. Cells were then counted with Vi-Cell cell counter (Beckman Coulter), stained with Zombie Violet live/dead dye (Biolegend) and fluorescence-labeled antibodies sequentially. After that, BH3 profiling with the iBH3 method was performed as previously described ( Ryan et al., 2016 51. Ryan, J. ∙ Montero, J. ∙ Rocco, J. ... iBH3: simple, fixable BH3 profiling to determine apoptotic priming in primary tissue by flow cytometry Biol. Chem. 2016; 397 :671-678 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and suspended at 1 million/mL in MEB2-P25 buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM mannitol, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM succinate, 1 μM EDTA, 1 μM EGTA, 0.1% protease free BSA, 0.25% polaxamer 188, pH = 7.4). Cells were then dispensed to 384-well plates (15 μL/well) containing peptides at 2X their final concentrations in 15 μL MEB2-P25 buffer with 0.002% digitonin. Cells were incubated at 25°C for 45 min before fixation and neutralization. Cells were then stained with cytochrome c antibody overnight at 4°C. samples were next analyzed by BD Fortessa flow cytometer with a high-throughput module. The raw data were converted to percentage of cytochrome c loss. The BH3 peptides are used as the probes for mitochondrial priming. When BIM peptide is used, the more cytochrome c release, the more primed the cells are for mtApoptosis. Therefore, mitochondrial priming is calculated as percentage of cytochrome c release following peptide exposure. For each data point, % cytochrome c loss was calculated using the equation described below. % c y t o c h r o m e c l o s s = 1 0 0 x ⁢ [ 1 - ( M F I T r e a t e d − M F I A L M ) / ( M F I C o n t r o l ⁢ - M F I A L M ) ]
“Treated” is the treatment well being analyzed, “ALM” is a control with alamethicin treatment which lead to highest possible release of cytochromes c, thus defining the minimum possible cytochrome c signal. The “Control” is a well with all assay components but no synthetic BH3 peptide, which defines complete cytochrome c retention (0% cytochrome c loss).

Cell surface staining was done on ice for 15 min in the dark. Briefly, single cells were stained with conjugated fluorescent, unconjugated primary antibodies, or isotype controls and incubated for 15min. Then cells were washed with ice-cold staining buffer two times by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min. When using unconjugated primary antibodies, the supernatant was aspirated off and the pellet was resuspended in 100 uL buffer with conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies and incubated on ice in the dark for 15 min. After another two washes, the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.3 mL of staining buffer with DAPI and incubated for 5 minutes in the dark. The cells are then ready for flow analysis.
Seven- to eight-week-old female NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratory) were subcutaneously injected with four million HeLa cells or half million HL60-BCL2 cells resuspended in a 50:50 mixture of cold PBS and Matrigel (GIBCO). After confirmation of engraftment, the mice were randomly assigned to six groups (n = 7 per group) and treated with drugs and/or NK cells as indicated in Figure 7 A. The NK cells used for in vivo studies were generated and pre-activated following the same procedure as described in STARMethods : Human NK cell isolation and expansion. ABT-199 was prepared weekly in 10% ethanol, 30% polyethyleneglycol-400, and 60% phosal 50 propylene glycol. S63845 was formulated extemporaneously in 25 mM HCl, 20% 2-hydroxy propyl β-cyclo dextrin 20% (Fisher Scientifics). All drugs and IL-2 were administrated at the doses and schedules as described in Figure 7 A. The width and length of the tumors were measured every two days (HL60-BCL2 model) or twice a week (HeLa model) using an electronic caliper. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (length × width 2 )/2. For ethical reasons, mice carrying tumors exceeding 2,000 mm 3 were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation after tumor sizes were measured and recorded. Tumor burden is represented as mean of tumor volume ± SEM over time (days). For the statistical analysis of differences in tumor volume between groups, a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures on day factor was performed. Log-rank test was used to statistically compare mouse survival curves of different groups.
Blood mononuclear cells were isolated as described above. CD8 + T cells were then isolated by negative selection using the EasySep™ Human CD8 + T Cell Enrichment Kit (#19053, StemCell Technologies). Enriched T cells (purity > 90%) were then resuspended with RPMI medium supplemented with 5 mM Hepes, 2 mM Glutamax, 50 μg/ml Pen/Strep, 5 mM NEAA, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, 9% certified heat-inactivated FBS, 1% human A/B serum, 50 μM beta-mercaptoethanol, as well as 30 IU/mL of human IL-2 (Peprotech). Next, 1 mL of T cells (2 million/mL) were transferred into each well of a 48-well plate and stimulated with 2 million CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (#11131D, ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocol. After stimulation, cells were pooled into flasks. Half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium to keep the cell density between 0.5 - 4 million/mL. After expansion, T cell purity (CD3 + CD8 + ) was > 97% as determined by flow cytometry analysis.
Non-tissue culture-treated 24-well plates were coated overnight at 4°C with recombinant fibronectin fragment (RetroNectin; Takara) at 25 μg/mL in PBS. The following day, the RetroNection solution was replaced with 0.5 mL of sterile 2% BSA in PBS to block the plates for 30 min at room temperature. After a single wash with PBS, virus particles were added and then pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 2 hours at 32°C. The supernatant was gently removed, and the wells are washed with 500 μL PBS followed by adding 0.5 million T cells in 2 mL T cell medium supplemented with 10 μg/mL protamine sulfate. Next the plates were centrifuged at 500 g for 3 min and then incubated for 3 days. On the third day after transduction, the cells were pooled together, stained with HA-tag antibody (#901509, Biolegend), and sorted to purify TCR transduced population. After sorting, transduced T cells were cultured in IL-2 containing media (30 IU/mL) and split as necessary to maintain cell density between 0.5 and 4 million cells/mL.
Lentiviral transduction was performed as described before ( Pan et al., 2017 41. Pan, R. ∙ Ruvolo, V. ∙ Mu, H. ... Synthetic lethality of combined Bcl-2 inhibition and p53 activation in AML: mechanisms and superior antileukemic efficacy Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :748-760.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, lentivirus was prepared by co-transfection of log-phase HEK293T cells with an equimolar mix of transfer vector psPAX2, packaging plasmid pMD2.G, and NY-ESO-1 Ag-Luci-ZsGreen plasmid using jetPrime transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Polyplus). Lentiviral supernatants were harvested 48 hr after transfection by centrifugation (800 g, 10 min) at room temperature. The supernatant was then filtered through 0.45 mM surfactant-free cellulose acetate membranes to remove lentivirus-producing cells. Polybrene (Chemicon) was added to a final concentration of 8 mg/mL, and the virus stock was used immediately to infect cell lines. Exponentially growing cells were resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 million cells per mL of virus stock, transferred to 12-well tissue plates, and centrifuged for 45 min (1,300 g, 30°C). After adding one volume of fresh virus stock, the cells were centrifuged again and incubated in a tissue culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for 1 hr. The cells were then washed twice with growth medium to remove the polybrene and returned to the tissue culture incubator. After two doubling times, infected cells were subjected to sorting for ZsGreen + population.
Pre-activated NK cells were cultured in a T175 flask with a starting density of 1 million/mL. After 3 days, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min to remove NK cells and cell debris. Then the conditioned medium was filtered using The Stericup™ vacuum filtration system (0.22 μM filter) from MilliporeSigma. The conditioned medium was then used to treat cancer cells on the same day of generation.
Transient gene knockdown was conducted using Accell siRNA transfection method. Accell siRNAs, Accell siRNA delivery media, and Accell non-targeting control were all purchased from Dharmacon. Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, log-phase cancer cells or pre-activated human primary NK cells (day 3) were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 5 min. The pelleted cells were then resuspended in appropriate volume of Accell siRNA Delivery Media. Next, siRNAs were added to a final concentration of 1 μM and gently mixed. The cells were then incubated with Accell siRNAs at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After 48 hr incubation, regular growth media for different cell types were added back to half of the transfection volume. After another 24 h, cells were harvested for cytotoxicity assays and an aliquot was lysed as descried in Immunoblotting and Antibodies . Gene knockdown was validated by immunoblotting.
Unless otherwise indicated, data represent the mean ± SEM of triplicate experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software v8.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). For normally distributed data and comparisons between two groups, the significance was calculated using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t -tests. Comparisons between three or more groups were performed using ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Log-rank test was used to statistically compare mouse survival curves of different groups. Throughout the paper, significance was determined at the following cutoff points: not significant (ns), p >0.05, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
