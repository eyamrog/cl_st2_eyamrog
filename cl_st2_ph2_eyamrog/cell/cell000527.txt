Title: GSDMB is increased in IBD and regulates epithelial restitution/repair independent of pyroptosis


Abstract: Summary

Gasdermins are a family of structurally related proteins originally described for their role in pyroptosis. Gasdermin B (GSDMB) is currently the least studied, and while its association with genetic susceptibility to chronic mucosal inflammatory disorders is well established, little is known about its functional relevance during active disease states. Herein, we report increased GSDMB in inflammatory bowel disease, with single-cell analysis identifying epithelial specificity to inflamed colonocytes/crypt top colonocytes. Surprisingly, mechanistic experiments and transcriptome profiling reveal lack of inherent GSDMB-dependent pyroptosis in activated epithelial cells and organoids but instead point to increased proliferation and migration during in vitro wound closure, which arrests in GSDMB-deficient cells that display hyper-adhesiveness and enhanced formation of vinculin-based focal adhesions dependent on PDGF-A-mediated FAK phosphorylation. Importantly, carriage of disease-associated GSDMB SNPs confers functional defects, disrupting epithelial restitution/repair, which, altogether, establishes GSDMB as a critical factor for restoration of epithelial barrier function and the resolution of inflammation.

Section: Introduction

Gasdermins (GSDMs) comprise six members (GSDM A–E and DFNB59) that, aside from DFNB59, share sequence homology and are primarily known for their role in pyroptosis ( Broz et al., 2020 4. Broz, P. ∙ Pelegrín, P. ∙ Shao, F. The gasdermins, a protein family executing cell death and inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :143-157 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ). At present, gasdermin D (GSDMD) is the best characterized of the GSDMs, and notably, the discovery of its pore-forming capabilities upon cleavage, oligomerization, and translocation of the N-terminal effector domain to the plasma membrane has revolutionized fundamental concepts regarding mechanisms of programmed cell death ( Shi et al., 2015 60. Shi, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, K. ... Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases determines pyroptotic cell death Nature. 2015; 526 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (4216) PubMed Google Scholar ) and interleukin (IL)-1β secretion ( Evavold et al., 2018 20. Evavold, C.L. ∙ Ruan, J. ∙ Tan, Y. ... The pore-forming protein gasdermin D regulates interleukin-1 secretion from living macrophages Immunity. 2018; 48 :35-44.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (774) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, the precise function and mechanism(s) of action of gasdermin B (GSDMB) remain somewhat elusive, mainly due to limited in vivo experimentation attributed to the lack of a mouse ortholog, which is unique among other GSDM family members ( Broz et al., 2020 4. Broz, P. ∙ Pelegrín, P. ∙ Shao, F. The gasdermins, a protein family executing cell death and inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :143-157 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike GSDMD, evidence supporting an essential role for GSDMB during pyroptosis is controversial ( Li et al., 2020 31. Li, L. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Bai, Y. Role of GSDMB in pyroptosis and cancer Cancer Manag. Res. 2020; 12 :3033-3043 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ), with recent studies indicating the requirement of either secondary effector cells (i.e., cytotoxic lymphocytes) ( Zhou et al., 2020 75. Zhou, Z. ∙ He, H. ∙ Wang, K. ... Granzyme A from cytotoxic lymphocytes cleaves GSDMB to trigger pyroptosis in target cells Science. 2020; 368 :eaaz7548 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ) or caspase-4 ( Chen et al., 2019 12. Chen, Q. ∙ Shi, P. ∙ Wang, Y. ... GSDMB promotes non-canonical pyroptosis by enhancing caspase-4 activity J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 11 :496-508 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ) for cleavage of full-length protein and subsequent activation of pyroptosis in GSDMB-expressing target cells. In fact, much of what has been speculated regarding GSDMB’s function is based on studies of other family members; however, GSDMB’s structure and domain architecture are reported as one of the most distinct compared with other GSDMs (Li et al., 2020a), giving rise to the speculation of alternative functions.
Clues uncovering the potential role(s) of GSDMB during health and disease mainly come from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) describing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the protein coding and transcriptional regulatory regions of GSDMB that are associated with increased susceptibility of acquiring immune-mediated disorders, including asthma ( Moffatt et al., 2007 41. Moffatt, M.F. ∙ Kabesch, M. ∙ Liang, L. ... Genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression contribute to the risk of childhood asthma Nature. 2007; 448 :470-473 Crossref Scopus (1346) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inflammatory bowel disease ( Jostins et al., 2012 64. Jostins, L. ∙ Ripke, S. ∙ Weersma, R.K. ... Host–microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2012; 491 :119-124 Crossref Scopus (3649) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, a survey of 27 different healthy tissues shows the greatest GSDMB abundance in GI-associated organs (i.e., stomach, small intestine, colon) ( Fagerberg et al., 2014 21. Fagerberg, L. ∙ Hallström, B.M. ∙ Oksvold, P. ... Analysis of the human tissue-specific expression by genome-wide integration of transcriptomics and antibody-based proteomics Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2014; 13 :397-406 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2556) PubMed Google Scholar ) and predominant expression in epithelial cells ( Saeki et al., 2009 56. Saeki, N. ∙ Usui, T. ∙ Aoyagi, K. ... Distinctive expression and function of four GSDM family genes ( GSDMA-D ) in normal and malignant upper gastrointestinal epithelium Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009; 48 :261-271 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, while more recent reports confirm GSDMB’s role in asthma, particularly those describing the influence of, and linkage to, gene polymorphisms on 17q21 ( Stein et al., 2018 62. Stein, M.M. ∙ Thompson, E.E. ∙ Schoettler, N. ... A decade of research on the 17q12-21 asthma locus: piecing together the puzzle J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2018; 142 :749-764.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2021 32. Li, X. ∙ Christenson, S.A. ∙ Modena, B. ... Genetic analyses identify GSDMB associated with asthma severity, exacerbations, and antiviral pathways J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2021; 147 :894-909 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), mechanistic studies regarding disease pathogenesis are severely lacking, with none to date evaluating GSDMB’s function in healthy intestinal mucosa and/or during IBD.
IBD, which encompasses Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic, relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in immune-mediated tissue destruction and compromise of intestinal barrier function. CD can occur anywhere along the GI tract and can penetrate transmurally, while UC is limited to the colonic mucosa. Although the precise etiology is currently unknown, it is well accepted that IBD develops from dysregulated mucosal immune responses to environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. To date, there is no known cure for IBD; rather, current treatment modalities are aimed at controlling symptoms and achieving long-term remission ( Pouillon et al., 2020 48. Pouillon, L. ∙ Travis, S. ∙ Bossuyt, P. ... Head-to-head trials in inflammatory bowel disease: past, present and future Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2020; 17 :365-376 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). A key physiological process that promotes restoration of normal organ function and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis is the resolution of inflammation, in which intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are central players due to their anatomical location and complex interaction(s) with both the underlying mucosal immune system, as well as the local gut microenvironment. In fact, dysfunction and/or delay in mucosal healing has been implicated in the development of IBD, as well as other chronic inflammatory disorders ( Leoni et al., 2015 30. Leoni, G. ∙ Neumann, P.-A. ∙ Sumagin, R. ... Wound repair: role of immune–epithelial interactions Mucosal Immunol. 2015; 8 :959-968 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ), wherein IECs fail to undergo appropriate repair and restitution, ultimately resulting in compromised barrier integrity. Currently, no treatment modalities exist that specifically enhance and/or improve gut barrier function; however, the intestinal epithelium represents a promising therapeutic target for IBD that remains a very active area of research and development ( Odenwald and Turner, 2017 44. Odenwald, M.A. ∙ Turner, J.R. The intestinal epithelial barrier: a therapeutic target? Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2017; 14 :9-21 Crossref Scopus (814) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Herein, we provide a comprehensive report characterizing the expression and potential function of GSDMB in IBD. GSDMB is upregulated and most prevalently expressed in IECs, specifically colonocytes/crypt top colonocytes, from both CD and UC patients with active disease compared with healthy controls. Importantly, our data show a lack of direct GSDMB-dependent programmed cell death (i.e., pyroptosis) in IECs and epithelial organoids but instead point to its functional importance in promoting epithelial migration and regulating cell adhesion, adding depth to the literature regarding its role during epithelial proliferation. We also mechanistically address the translational relevance of GSDMB’s disease-associated SNPs ( Chao et al., 2017 10. Chao, K.L. ∙ Kulakova, L. ∙ Herzberg, O. Gene polymorphism linked to increased asthma and IBD risk alters gasdermin-B structure, a sulfatide and phosphoinositide binding protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E1128-E1137 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ) and demonstrate key functional differences from wild-type GSDMB . Specifically, the introduction of changes from glycine to arginine at position 299 and from proline to serine at position 306 in GSDMB markedly dampens IEC proliferation and migration but profoundly enhances epithelial adhesion by impeding phosphorylation of the key focal adhesion protein, FAK (focal adhesion kinase), through a mechanism that involves PDGF-A that together impairs wound healing. These effects can be partially overridden by pharmacologically targeting phosphorylation of FAK. In summary, our results show IBD-specific upregulation of epithelial-derived GSDMB, a function that is overall protective in nature; yet, the introduction of disease-associated GSDMB SNPs confers functional alterations that mechanistically affect IEC processes critical for restoration of barrier integrity and the resolution of inflammation.

Section: Results

To initially screen for GSDMB in IBD, the GSE database was mined using two separate datasets of endoscopically procured gut mucosal biopsies from both patients with CD and UC ( Table S1 ). Overall, GSDMB is increased in inflamed mucosa from different anatomical locations (i.e., terminal ileum, as well as the ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon) in CD, with more striking differences observed at the same site of consecutive active and remission stages of disease during UC, compared with non-inflamed, location-matched healthy controls ( Figure 1 A). To expand these studies, macroscopically involved and non-involved biopsies from individual patients with CD and UC ( Table S2 ) were assayed, with results confirming substantial increases in GSDMB compared with non-inflamed, healthy controls and a consistent trend of elevated GSDMB in involved versus non-involved patient-matched samples ( Figure 1 B, left). At the protein level, robust expression of full-length (FL), and to a lesser extent, cleaved, GSDMB is present in gut mucosal biopsies from both patients with CD and UC compared with non-inflamed, healthy controls ( Figure 1 B, right) indicating abundant pooled sources of GSDMB-FL, of which partial cleavage occurs during IBD in both involved and non-involved areas ( Figure S1 A).
Immunolocalization experiments were performed on surgically resected full-thickness intestinal tissues from patients with IBD compared with non-inflamed, healthy margins of patients undergoing therapeutic bowel resection for malignant and other non-malignant, non-inflammatory conditions to determine the precise cellular source of increased GSDMB in IBD. The results show intense staining in ileal and colonic specimens from patients with CD and UC, respectively, that mainly localizes to IECs, with little to any expression in controls ( Figure 1 C, left). Interestingly, the presence of GSDMB in restituting epithelium, characterized by undifferentiated, single-layer IECs overlying areas of active inflammation and granulation tissue, commonly found in IBD ( Figure 1 C, arrows), suggests its role in mucosal healing. Co-localization of GSDMB (red) with the epithelial-specific cell surface marker, EpCAM (green) ( Figure 1 C, right), confirms expression to the epithelium, specifically along the plasma membrane in inflamed IBD tissues ( Figure 1 C, arrowheads). In further support of these findings, freshly isolated IECs from nonresolving CD and UC patients ( Table S2 ) show dramatic increases (5.09-fold and 5.83-fold, respectively) in GSDMB compared with non-inflamed healthy controls ( Figure 2 A, left). Corresponding protein levels are also consistent with those observed in unfractionated gut mucosal tissues, with robust expression of IEC-derived GSDMB-FL in patients with CD and UC compared with controls but notably in the absence of cleaved forms ( Figure 2 A, right, Figure S1 B).
Next, to further identify GSDMB -expressing IEC subpopulations, a supervised analysis was performed on a previously published large-scale scRNA-seq dataset compiled from profiled IECs, isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed areas of active, immunomodulatory-naive patients with UC and from normal, non-inflamed healthy controls, in which IEC subpopulations unique to IBD were reported ( Parikh et al., 2019 45. Parikh, K. ∙ Antanaviciute, A. ∙ Fawkner-Corbett, D. ... Colonic epithelial cell diversity in health and inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2019; 567 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 D). Results reveal differential distribution and distinct differences in relative GSDMB among IEC subtypes ( Figures 2 B and 2C), predominantly in colonocytes, crypt top colonocytes, and, to a lesser extent, goblet cells, with a general increase in inflamed versus non-inflamed and healthy controls ( Figure 2 C). Upregulated gene ontology (GO) biological processes were evaluated in GSDMB -expressing colonocyte and crypt top colonocyte subpopulations, showing the prevalence of gene enrichment pathways associated with proliferation, migration, and adhesion ( Figure 2 D) but surprisingly lacking the prevalence of those related to pyroptosis or cell lysis. Together, our results represent a comprehensive characterization of GSDMB in IBD, showing increased GSDMB, primarily localized to IECs and indicate potential functional importance in non-pyroptotic roles.
The unexpected lack of enriched gene pathways identified with pyroptosis in our scRNA-seq analysis prompted further investigation of GSDMB-dependent functions, importantly dissecting its role in the absence of confounding inflammation. A fundamental issue pervading the field of gasdermin biology has been to identify the mechanism(s) by which GSDMB can be increased in vitro ( Broz et al., 2020 4. Broz, P. ∙ Pelegrín, P. ∙ Shao, F. The gasdermins, a protein family executing cell death and inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :143-157 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2020a). To this end, evaluation of several IEC lines was performed, selecting undifferentiated HT-29 cells, a human adenocarcinoma colorectal cell line, for its ability to endogenously express GSDMB ( Figure S2 A) and to serve as a suitable transfection host. Moreover, after testing a wide array of inflammatory mediators known to be involved in the development of IBD ( Figure S2 B) and using a public repository of high-throughput functional genomic data analyzing potential molecules regulating GSDMB (i.e., GEO, NIH), methotrexate (Mtx) was identified as an inducer of GSDMB-FL, but of note, it did not execute its cleavage, similar to IFNγ ( Zhou et al., 2020 75. Zhou, Z. ∙ He, H. ∙ Wang, K. ... Granzyme A from cytotoxic lymphocytes cleaves GSDMB to trigger pyroptosis in target cells Science. 2020; 368 :eaaz7548 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2 C and S2D). Mtx is a multi-function drug, best known to inhibit purine and pyrimidine synthesis and target proliferation of T lymphocytes ( Cronstein and Aune, 2020 14. Cronstein, B.N. ∙ Aune, T.M. Methotrexate and its mechanisms of action in inflammatory arthritis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2020; 16 :145-154 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas little is known regarding its effect(s) on IECs ( Jeffes et al., 1995 28. Jeffes, E.W.B. ∙ McCullough, J.L. ∙ Pittelkow, M.R. ... Methotrexate therapy of psoriasis: differential sensitivity of proliferating lymphoid and epithelial cells to the cytotoxic and growth-inhibitory effects of methotrexate J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104 :183-188 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunolabeling of GSDMB in HT-29s demonstrates upregulation of its expression and importantly, translocation to the lateral plasma membrane where it is adjacent to, and/or co-localizes with the basolateral plasma membrane marker, E-cadherin, in a punctate pattern upon stimulation with Mtx ( Figure 3 A, middle, arrowheads) but not with IFNγ ( Figure 3 A, lower). Subcellular fractionation displays consistent results with this finding, showing increased GSDMB-FL in IEC membrane and organelle fractions upon exposure to Mtx versus IFNγ or untreated controls ( Figure 3 B). These results are confirmed in colonic epithelial organoids ( Table S2 ), in which GSDMB increases after exposure to Mtx and IFNγ but co-localizes (arrowheads) with EpCAM only after Mtx stimulation ( Figure 3 C).
Remarkably, Mtx- and IFNγ-induced GSDMB expression does not induce IEC cytotoxicity, measured by lack of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release, in either wild-type (WT) HT-29 or GSDMB knockout (GSDMB −/− ) cells ( Figures S3 A–S3E), compared with untreated controls ( Figure 3 D). These results are confirmed in epithelial organoids upon Mtx stimulation, in contrast to GSDMD-dependent activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by LPS plus nigericin that predictably triggers significant cell death ( Mehto et al., 2019 39. Mehto, S. ∙ Jena, K.K. ∙ Nath, P. ... The Crohn’s Disease Risk Factor IRGM Limits NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation by Impeding Its Assembly and by Mediating Its Selective Autophagy Mol Cell. 2019; 73 :429-445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicated by the uptake of SYTOX Deep Red stain ( Figure 3 E, arrowheads). Association between cell death and GSDMB expression was examined via processing and cleavage of pyroptotic caspase 1 ( Figures S2 E and S2F), in addition to cleavage of initiator caspase-8 and executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7, all of which yielded negative results in WT and GSDMB −/− cells, with or without GSDMB upregulation ( Figures S2 G–S2I). Together, these data indicate that, despite its ability to upregulate and translocate GSDMB-FL to the cell membrane and cell membrane-associated organelles, Mtx does not appear to induce GSDMB-dependent cell death by pore formation, which may be attributed to its failure to cleave GSDMB-FL.
To further address this issue, either GSDMB-NT or GSDMB-FL was overexpressed in HEK293T cells, which lack endogenous expression of any gasdermins ( Zhou et al., 2020 75. Zhou, Z. ∙ He, H. ∙ Wang, K. ... Granzyme A from cytotoxic lymphocytes cleaves GSDMB to trigger pyroptosis in target cells Science. 2020; 368 :eaaz7548 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ), and compared with cells overexpressing GSDMD-NT ( Figures S4 A–S4C) that effectively induce cell death by autolytic pore formation ( Shi et al., 2015 60. Shi, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Wang, K. ... Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases determines pyroptotic cell death Nature. 2015; 526 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (4216) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike GSDMD-NT, neither GSDMB-NT nor GSDMB-FL has the ability to induce cell cytotoxicity ( Figure 3 F), and neither shows evidence of pore formation, measured by propidium iodide (PI) uptake ( Figures 3 G and S4 D), a hallmark feature of pyroptosis leading to eventual cell lysis ( Ding et al., 2016 18. Ding, J. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Liu, W. ... Pore-forming activity and structural autoinhibition of the gasdermin family Nature. 2016; 535 :111-116 Crossref Scopus (1830) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results suggest that other GSDMB-dependent, non-pyroptotic function(s) may be important and likely occur in IECs.
In line with our scRNA-seq results ( Figure 2 D) and following an unsupervised cluster analysis of RNA-seq expression data comparing GSDMB −/− versus WT HT-29s, we found significant enrichment of GO pathways associated with proliferation, migration, and adhesion ( Figures S5 A and S5B). These are key IEC functions that are essential for maintenance of the normal gut barrier under homeostatic conditions and barrier restitution during mucosal inflammation. Heatmaps demonstrate global, yet distinct, differences in expression of genes related to proliferation and migration comparing GSDMB −/− versus WT HT-29s ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Applying more strict statistical criteria (log 2 FC > 2) ( Figure 4 A), differential gene expression of molecules related to decreased epithelial proliferation is observed in GSDMB −/− compared with WT HT-29s, including CDX2 , CDKN1A , HOXD13 , MTSS1 , PHLDA2 , and HLA-DMB ( Figure 4 B), which represent the greatest, differentially expressed genes ( Table S3 ). Functionally, cells lacking GSDMB demonstrate a marked reduction in baseline proliferative activity compared with controls (by approximately 45%), and while stimulation with Mtx, but not IFNγ, causes a modest yet significant increase, these responses are generally dampened in GSDMB −/− cells ( Figure 4 C).
Because wound repair requires sequential phases of proliferation and migration ( Gurtner et al., 2008 23. Gurtner, G.C. ∙ Werner, S. ∙ Barrandon, Y. ... Wound repair and regeneration Nature. 2008; 453 :314-321 Crossref Scopus (4658) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next evaluated GSDMB’s potential role in contributing to in vitro wound healing and found that lack of GSDMB substantially impedes IEC wound closure in WT HT-29s (by 57%), as well as after Mtx or IFNγ treatment (by 68% and 48%, respectively), and is accelerated in WT cells upon stimulation with Mtx (by 24%) but not with IFNγ ( Figure 4 D). In fact, heatmap clustering of genes associated with epithelial migration, such as CX3CL1 , AGT , CSPG4 , ROBO1 , and TGFB1 , reveals significant differences comparing GSDMB −/− IECs and WT HT-29 cells and points to decreased migration in the absence of GSDMB ( Figures 4 E and 4F; Table S3 ). Boyden chamber migration assays functionally show that the lack of GSDMB potently decreases the ability of IECs to effectively migrate compared with WT HT-29s, even in the absence or presence of either Mtx or IFNγ (by 57%, 54%, and 55%, respectively; Figure 4 G). Overall, these data further support GSDMB’s role in IEC proliferation, while highlighting its contribution to GSDMB-dependent epithelial cell migration.
Extracellular matrix adhesion represents an important mechanism impacting cell migration and overall cell motility ( Ridley et al., 2003 52. Ridley, A.J. ∙ Schwartz, M.A. ∙ Burridge, K. ... Cell migration: integrating signals from front to back Science. 2003; 302 :1704-1709 Crossref Scopus (4008) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with the previous observations, heatmap gene clustering of adhesion-related molecules is significantly altered in GSDMB −/− compared with WT HT-29 IECs ( Figure S5 E) and includes CDH17 , CD99 , GAS6 , KIF26B , GPC4 , and CAV1 ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Table S3 ). Network analyses generated with central nodes of proliferation, migration, and adhesion showcase differentially expressed genes with log 2 FC>2 and highlight their interconnections ( Figure 5 C). Functionally, adhesion is markedly enhanced in GSDMB −/− cells versus WT controls (by 20%) and further increases with Mtx (by 37%) ( Figure 5 D). To gain better insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this GSDMB-dependent phenotype, immunofluorescent labeling of wound-activated HT-29 cells was performed for vinculin, a molecule associated with cell-matrix adhesion ( Bays and DeMali, 2017 3. Bays, J.L. ∙ DeMali, K.A. Vinculin in cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesions Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2017; 74 :2999-3009 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ), and non-muscle myosin IIA (NM IIA), providing contextual structural morphology for the leading edge of the inflicted wound. Our results reveal the emergence of vinculin-based focal adhesions in GSDMB −/− cells when stimulated with Mtx, which are increased compared with WT ( Figure 5 E, arrows). Together, we show that lack of GSDMB results in a hyper-adhesive IEC phenotype that impairs the overarching process of epithelial wound closure.
To date, the most compelling data linking GSDMB to IBD come from GWASs, revealing strong genetic association in regions of chromosome 17q21, corresponding to GSDMB , with increased susceptibility to IBD ( Jostins et al., 2012 64. Jostins, L. ∙ Ripke, S. ∙ Weersma, R.K. ... Host–microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2012; 491 :119-124 Crossref Scopus (3649) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two candidate SNPs (rs2305479 and rs2305480) include a change from glycine to arginine at position 299 and from proline to serine at position 306, respectively ( GSDMB ΔR299:S306 ), which, together, is speculated to confer decreased conformational flexibility and a greater positive surface charge compared with WT GSDMB ( GSDMB G299:P306 ), based on differences in their crystal structure ( Chao et al., 2017 10. Chao, K.L. ∙ Kulakova, L. ∙ Herzberg, O. Gene polymorphism linked to increased asthma and IBD risk alters gasdermin-B structure, a sulfatide and phosphoinositide binding protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E1128-E1137 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, preliminary findings indicate that carriage of mutant GSDMB ΔR299:S306 confers increased GSDMB in gut mucosal biopsies derived from patients with IBD as well as healthy controls, compared with WT GSDMB G299:P306 ( Figure S1 C).
To assess the functional relevance of these SNPs, specifically in IECs, we utilized GSDMB −/− (KO) cells and developed rescued cell lines that stably express GSDMB encoded by either mutant or canonical WT GSDMB , with GSDMB KO cells transfected with an empty vector serving as control (Cont.) ( Figures S3 F–S3H). RNA-seq comparing IECs rescued with WT versus mutant GSDMB once again shows significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes related to proliferation, migration, and adhesion ( Figure 6 A). Functionally, both GSDMB-overexpressing IEC lines demonstrate markedly increased proliferation compared with control. However, mutant GSDMB ΔR299:S306 IECs show a slight, although significant, decrease in proliferative activity compared with GSDMB WT ( Figure 6 B). In line with these results, carriage of mutant GSMDB in colonic epithelial organoids derived from patients with UC shows less proliferation compared with WT, measured by DNA synthesis staining with EdU, which further decreases in WT GSDMB KD (knockdown) organoids ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Measurement of in vitro wound healing reveals more striking results, in which GSDMB −/− cells rescued with GSDMB WT exhibit accelerated wound closure versus mutant GSDMB ΔR299:S306 and Cont. (by 32% and 75%, respectively), even after Mtx ( Figure 6 C), which was recapitulated in WT versus mutant and in WT GSDMB KD organoids ( Figure S6 C). Moreover, migration of mutant GSDMB ΔR299:S306 IECs is dampened (by 47%) ( Figure 6 D), while adhesion is significantly increased ( Figure 6 E) compared with GSDMB WT, similar to what is observed in organoids carrying the mutant GSDMB variants versus WT GSDMB , which is further enhanced when GSDMB is knocked down ( Figure S6 D). Expectedly, co-localization of NM IIA and vinculin in control IECs lacking GSDMB highlights the presence of vinculin-based focal adhesions ( Figure 6 F, upper), which are virtually absent in rescued GSDMB WT IECs ( Figure 6 F, middle). However, robust formation of these vinculin-based adhesion stress fibers is evident in mutant, IBD-associated GSDMB ΔR299:S306 IECs ( Figure 6 F, lower). These results are consistent with observations of UC organoids carrying either WT or mutant GSDMB , which show enhanced stress fibers (arrows) after stimulation with Mtx ( Figure S6 E). Together, these results indicate that carriage of GSDMB -associated IBD SNPs confers functional IEC alterations associated with decreased proliferation and migration and enhanced adhesion, which together hamper epithelial restitution/repair processes important during mucosal wound healing.
To better understand potential mechanism(s) involved in GSDMB-mediated regulation of efficient IEC restitution, we interrogated a battery of adhesion-related molecules ( Figure S7 A), which are important and known regulators of focal adhesion dynamics ( Figure S7 B). Our results show a specific decrease of FAK phosphorylation in GSDMB −/− versus control WT cells, which has been reported to considerably enhance cell adhesion ( McLean et al., 2005 38. McLean, G.W. ∙ Carragher, N.O. ∙ Avizienyte, E. ... The role of focal-adhesion kinase in cancer – a new therapeutic opportunity Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5 :505-515 Crossref Scopus (909) PubMed Google Scholar ), with no change in baseline, unphosphorylated FAK ( Figures 7 A and S7 C). Phosphorylated FAK is decreased in IECs rescued with mutant GSDMB ΔR299:S306 , similar to control IECs lacking GSDMB , compared with GSDMB WT ( Figures 7 B and S7 D). Using a small-molecule drug, ZINC40099027, that serves as an allosteric activator of FAK phosphorylation ( Rashmi et al., 2021 50. Rashmi ∙ More, S.K. ∙ Wang, Q. ...

Perspect. 2021; 9 :e00737 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S7 E), in vitro epithelial wound closure of treated WT, but not GSDMB −/− , IECs is dramatically increased, whereas wound closure is accelerated in rescued GSDMB WT and to a lesser extent in mutant GSDMB ΔR299:S306 ( Figure 7 C). Heatmaps of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq of GSDMB −/− versus WT HT-29s, in fact, show clustering of molecules related to regulation and/or function of FAK ( Figure 7 D), including PDGFA , a polypeptide growth factor demonstrated to phosphorylate FAK ( Singh et al., 2019 61.

Physiol. 2004; 200 :213-222 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was analyzed to be of greatest statistical significance compared with all modulated genes ( Figure 7 E). PDGF-AA protein expression (one of two ligands encoded by the PDGFA gene) was confirmed to be dependent upon GSDMB expression, rescued by WT GSDMB and to a lesser extent by GSDMB ΔR299:S306 ( Figure 7 F), whereas PDGF-AB did not display significant trends dependent upon GSDMB ( Figure S7 F). Upon stimulation with recombinant PDGF-AA, FAK phosphorylation was observed to increase in WT HT-29s, but more significantly, it increased in GSDMB −/− cells ( Figure 7 G), prompting rescue of the deficiency in epithelial in vitro wound closure ( Figure 7 H). Overall, these data further support GSDMB’s role in proliferation while highlighting GSDMB-dependent functions of cell migration and adhesion, with changes in FAK phosphorylation modulated by PDGF-A, which globally affect cell motility and the overall process of epithelial restitution and repair ( Figure 7 I).

Section: Discussion

Although the current literature indicates an undeniable link between GSDMB and genetic susceptibility to asthma and IBD, functional studies are limited due to the lack of in vivo models. An exception is the study by Das et al., in which bronchoprovocation of mice genetically engineered to overexpress the human GSDMB-FL transgene (i.e., h GSDMB Zp3-Cre strain) showed airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling after methacholine exposure (in the absence of inflammation), which could be exacerbated upon challenge with house dust mite allergens that also induced potent Th2 immune responses and asthma-like symptoms ( Das et al., 2016 15. Das, S. ∙ Miller, M. ∙ Beppu, A.K. ... GSDMB induces an asthma phenotype characterized by increased airway responsiveness and remodeling without lung inflammation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :13132-13137 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pyroptosis was not investigated in this study, and since these mice were contrived to globally produce GSMDB, it is unclear whether the aforementioned effects are specifically due to overexpression of IEC-derived GSDMB or an orchestration of several different cell types that may, or may not, normally produce GSDMB. It should be noted, however, that h GSDMB Zp3-Cre mice appear to develop normally, and under homeostatic conditions, no phenotypic pathologies were reported when compared with WT controls ( Das et al., 2016 15. Das, S. ∙ Miller, M. ∙ Beppu, A.K. ... GSDMB induces an asthma phenotype characterized by increased airway responsiveness and remodeling without lung inflammation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :13132-13137 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the GI tract was not specifically examined for baseline inflammation and/or other gut-related abnormalities.
While GSDMB-related research has been more active in asthma, this study fully characterizes GSDMB in patients with both CD and UC, the two idiopathic forms of IBD. In line with other disease states, we show that, in IBD, the major source of GSDMB is IECs, particularly from inflamed lesions, with single-cell profiling determining specificity to colonocytes and crypt top colonocytes, known to be functionally essential for absorption, and more recently described to express upregulated inflammatory pathways across these cell clusters ( Parikh et al., 2019 45. Parikh, K. ∙ Antanaviciute, A. ∙ Fawkner-Corbett, D. ... Colonic epithelial cell diversity in health and inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2019; 567 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon further analysis of GSDMB + colonocytes/crypt top colonocytes, we found enriched gene pathways associated with proliferation, migration, and adhesion but, surprisingly, not programmed cell death/pyroptosis, which led us to pursue potential GSDMB-dependent mechanism(s) focused on epithelial restitution and mucosal wound healing. Interestingly, across all IEC subtypes, we recently showed increased GSDMD also in colonocytes and crypt top colonocytes from inflamed IBD lesions ( Bulek et al., 2020 6. Bulek, K. ∙ Zhao, J. ∙ Liao, Y. ... Epithelial-derived gasdermin D mediates nonlytic IL-1β release during experimental colitis J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :4218-4234 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting probable interaction(s) and cooperativity of these two gasdermin family members, at least in particular subpopulation of IECs, which may contribute to IBD pathogenesis. Further investigation is warranted to probe this potential relationship.
Of note, while it is well accepted that GSDMD is required, the contribution of GSDMB during pyroptosis and subsequent cell lysis remains a contested issue (Li et al., 2020a). Earlier studies suggest alternative, non-pyroptotic (mainly proliferative) functions, whereas more recent studies point to pyroptosis but by non-conventional mechanisms that are dependent upon either caspase-4 ( Chen et al., 2019 12. Chen, Q. ∙ Shi, P. ∙ Wang, Y. ... GSDMB promotes non-canonical pyroptosis by enhancing caspase-4 activity J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 11 :496-508 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ) or a two-step process relying on the interaction with cytotoxic lymphocytes ( Zhou et al., 2020 75. Zhou, Z. ∙ He, H. ∙ Wang, K. ... Granzyme A from cytotoxic lymphocytes cleaves GSDMB to trigger pyroptosis in target cells Science. 2020; 368 :eaaz7548 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the latter, electroporation or release of pore-forming perforin after co-culture with either cytotoxic T lymphocytes or NK cells allows access of granzyme A into GSDMB-expressing target cells, which cleaves and activates GSDMB-FL, resulting in pyroptosis ( Zhou et al., 2020 75. Zhou, Z. ∙ He, H. ∙ Wang, K. ... Granzyme A from cytotoxic lymphocytes cleaves GSDMB to trigger pyroptosis in target cells Science. 2020; 368 :eaaz7548 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although our data point to inherent, non-pyroptotic function(s), GSDMB-dependent IEC pyroptosis cannot be ruled out as a potential pathogenic mechanism during IBD. Indeed, while GSDMB-FL remains the major isoform, cleaved fragments are also clearly present in IBD intestinal biopsies (comprising several mucosal cell types) in involved and non-involved lesions but are virtually absent in freshly isolated IECs from all patient groups. As such, while inflammation, for example, may provide the trigger for GSDMB-dependent pyroptosis, which may or may not require auxiliary immune cells, other roles for GSDMB, particularly its full-length form, may also have functional importance for the gut epithelium.
In the search for non-inflammatory stimuli that could potentially upregulate GSDMB, we mined publicly accessible high-throughput functional genomics data submitted by the research community and ultimately identified Mtx, a folate antagonist and well-established pharmaceutical used to treat inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis ( Cronstein and Aune, 2020 14. Cronstein, B.N. ∙ Aune, T.M. Methotrexate and its mechanisms of action in inflammatory arthritis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2020; 16 :145-154 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ) and IBD ( Herfarth et al., 2016 25. Herfarth, H.H. ∙ Kappelman, M.D. ∙ Long, M.D. ... Use of methotrexate in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2016; 22 :224-233 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although it has long been accepted to impede proliferation of T lymphocytes by inhibiting de novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, alternative mechanisms of action have been recently attributed to Mtx, including, among others, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, activation of JAK-STAT signaling, and transmethylation reactions ( Cronstein and Aune, 2020 14. Cronstein, B.N. ∙ Aune, T.M. Methotrexate and its mechanisms of action in inflammatory arthritis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2020; 16 :145-154 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ). Herein, we report the induction of epithelial-derived GSDMB via Mtx and, importantly, make the observation that Mtx promotes GSDMB translocation to the plasma membrane, interestingly only in its full-length form, which together makes Mtx useful to regulate GSDMB without the confounding factors associated with inflammation. With regard to inflammatory stimuli, however, IFNγ was also recently described to markedly upregulate GSDMB ( Zhou et al., 2020 75. Zhou, Z. ∙ He, H. ∙ Wang, K. ... Granzyme A from cytotoxic lymphocytes cleaves GSDMB to trigger pyroptosis in target cells Science. 2020; 368 :eaaz7548 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ), which we confirm, but unlike Mtx, it does not elicit translocation to membrane-bound organelles or the plasma membrane. We also confirm the ability of IFNγ alone to promote cell cytotoxicity and robustly induce caspase-1 ( Detjen et al., 2001 17. Detjen, K.M. ∙ Farwig, K. ∙ Welzel, M. ... Interferon gamma inhibits growth of human pancreatic carcinoma cells via caspase-1 dependent induction of apoptosis Gut. 2001; 49 :251-262 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, these effects are independent of GSDMB.
Importantly, our data highlight a previously unrecognized function of GSDMB in regulating IEC migration, a required process for effective epithelial restitution and repair that is particularly critical for patients with IBD to promote healing of mucosal wounds and ulcerations during remission phases of disease. Epithelial wound healing is a collective process orchestrated by a variety of mechanisms but primarily coordinates proliferation and migration of cells and requires critical interactions between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions ( Leoni et al., 2015 30. Leoni, G. ∙ Neumann, P.-A. ∙ Sumagin, R. ... Wound repair: role of immune–epithelial interactions Mucosal Immunol. 2015; 8 :959-968 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our reported effects of GSDMB on IEC migration appear to be independent from regulation of cell proliferation and involve control of cell-matrix adhesion; specifically, loss of GSDMB results in cell hyper-adhesiveness, which impedes cell motility. Enhanced GSDMB-dependent matrix adhesion is associated with the increased assembly of vinculin-based focal adhesions. This is likely due to PDGF-A-dependent inactivation (de-phosphorylation) of FAK, a key tyrosine kinase that regulates focal adhesion turnover and linkage to the cytoskeleton ( Schaller, 2010 58. Schaller, M.D. Cellular functions of FAK kinases: insight into molecular mechanisms and novel functions J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 :1007-1013 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hu et al., 2014 26. Hu, Y.-L. ∙ Lu, S. ∙ Szeto, K.W. ... FAK and paxillin dynamics at focal adhesions in the protrusions of migrating cells Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :6024 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). PDGF-A is one of the four growth factors and is a well-established modulator of cellular proliferation ( Chen et al., 2013 11. Chen, P.-H. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ He, X. Platelet-derived growth factors and their receptors: structural and functional perspectives Acta BBA - Proteins Proteomics 1834. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 2176-2186 Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar ), but importantly, it is a well-established modulator of actin reorganization and phosphorylation of FAK ( Singh et al., 2019 61. Singh, J. ∙ Sharma, K. ∙ Frost, E.E. ... Role of PDGF-A-activated ERK signaling mediated FAK-paxillin interaction in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell migration J. Mol. Neurosci. 2019; 67 :564-573 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), specifically at site Tyr-397, the area of our focus ( Hunger-Glaser et al., 2004 27. Hunger-Glaser, I. ∙ Fan, R.S. ∙ Perez-Salazar, E. ... PDGF and FGF induce focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation at Ser-910: dissociation from Tyr-397 phosphorylation and requirement for ERK activation J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200 :213-222 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that GSDMB KO IECs rescued with IBD-associated GSDMB SNPs decrease phosphorylation of FAK and increase formation of vinculin-based actomyosin stress fibers, together enhancing adhesion and phenotypically resembling IECs lacking GSDMB. Furthermore, using a small drug-like FAK allosteric activator, ZINC40099027, in addition to recombinant PDGF-AA, we confirm the importance of FAK phosphorylation for GSDMB-mediated in vitro wound closure, which represents an interesting therapeutic target to enhance epithelial restitution and repair, similar to other effector molecules impacting epithelial barrier integrity and function, including MLCK1, which has shown success in pre-clinical models of IBD ( Graham et al., 2019 22. Graham, W.V. ∙ He, W. ∙ Marchiando, A.M. ... Intracellular MLCK1 diversion reverses barrier loss to restore mucosal homeostasis Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :690-700 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study conceptually presents the functional consequences of carriage of disease-associated GSMDB SNPs, aside from increased adhesion, decreased migration, and to a lesser extent, proliferation, as well as overall hampered in vitro wound healing, which occurs in IECs. These results complement a recent study reporting conformational changes in the crystal structure of GSDMB-FL that cause an altered charge on the protein surface loop and subsequent structural rigidity of mutant GSDMB ( Chao et al., 2017 10. Chao, K.L. ∙ Kulakova, L. ∙ Herzberg, O. Gene polymorphism linked to increased asthma and IBD risk alters gasdermin-B structure, a sulfatide and phosphoinositide binding protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E1128-E1137 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the same study, GSDMB-FL binding to phosphoinositides and sulfatides ( Chao et al., 2017 10. Chao, K.L. ∙ Kulakova, L. ∙ Herzberg, O. Gene polymorphism linked to increased asthma and IBD risk alters gasdermin-B structure, a sulfatide and phosphoinositide binding protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E1128-E1137 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ), commonly enriched within intracellular plasma/organelle and apical membranes of epithelial cells, respectively, was observed, which, along with our data demonstrating GSDMB-FL translocation to membrane-associated cell structures, suggests that mutant GSDMB may impede the efficiency of epithelial motility during restitution.
In conclusion, we report functions of full-length GSDMB that involve epithelial restitution and repair via cellular proliferation, migration, and adhesion, and modulation of FAK phosphorylation that are, in part, regulated by PDGF-A. Future studies investigating potential downstream targets of GSDMB will be critical to better understand the molecular mechanisms of these processes, especially differences attributed to disease-associated GSDMB SNPs. Our findings provide the foundation to develop therapeutic strategies that target GSDMB to potentially improve epithelial restitution/repair and the resolution of inflammation, with the goal of more effectively treating disorders affecting barrier function, such as IBD.
While GSDMB lacks a mouse ortholog, future studies utilizing animal models of IBD that transgenically express h GSDMB may provide more clarity regarding its role in an in vivo setting. Preliminary data regarding IBD biopsy samples expressing mutant GSDMB (containing SNPs correlated with increased risk of asthma and IBD) also needs to be further expanded using large patient populations to better define a definitive association between mutant and WT GSDMB with regard to IBD phenotype and disease progression. Additionally, while the present study has provided a better understanding regarding the mechanism by which GSDMB-dependent function(s) in IECs impact IBD pathogenesis, at the same time, it has also instigated compelling questions to pursue for future investigation. For example, what is GSDMB’s precise role in IL-1β processing and secretion, and do GSDMB-FL versus GSDMB-NT proteins impart functional differences that impact fundamental epithelial biology? Furthermore, the downstream targets of GSDMB, including FAK and PDGF-A, represent one pathway that promotes epithelial restitution and repair; however, restoration of intestinal barrier function is a multifactorial process and likely encompasses other GSDMB-dependent molecular signaling events that require further study.
Finally, an important conceptual issue that cannot be ignored is that both IBD and asthma are disorders that affect organs directly interfacing with the external environment and their associated microbiomes ( Budden et al., 2017 5. Budden, K.F. ∙ Gellatly, S.L. ∙ Wood, D.L.A. ... Emerging pathogenic links between microbiota and the gut–lung axis Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 15 :55-63 Crossref Scopus (959) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, the emerging role of gasdermin family members within the context of infection has centered upon host defense ( Tang et al., 2020 63. Tang, L. ∙ Lu, C. ∙ Zheng, G. ... Emerging insights on the role of gasdermins in infection and inflammatory diseases Clin. Transl. Immunology. 2020; 9 :e1186 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, with regard to GSDMB, little is known concerning the impact of infection and/or the microbiome. Earlier work reported increased GSDMB after rhinovirus infection ( Çalışkan et al., 2013 8. Çalışkan, M. ∙ Bochkov, Y.A. ∙ Kreiner-Møller, E. ... Rhinovirus wheezing illness and genetic risk of childhood-onset asthma N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368 :1398-1407 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ), while a more recent study elegantly showed that, after Shigella infection, GSDMB can selectively form pores in bacterial-derived membranes and promote microbicidal activity while protecting host IECs from undergoing pyroptosis ( Hansen et al., 2021 24. Hansen, J.M. ∙ de Jong, M.F. ∙ Wu, Q. ... Pathogenic ubiquitination of GSDMB inhibits NK cell bactericidal functions Cell. 2021; 184 :3178-3191.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further investigations regarding the potential role(s) of GSDMB during host-microbiome interaction(s) are warranted and will likely uncover important, functional mechanism(s) in mucosal-associated diseases, such as IBD.

Surgically-resected intestinal tissues, gut mucosal biopsies and freshly-isolated IECs were harvested and/or processed as previously described ( Pastorelli et al., 2010 47. Pastorelli, L. ∙ Garg, R.R. ∙ Hoang, S.B. ... Epithelial-derived IL-33 and its receptor ST2 are dysregulated in ulcerative colitis and in experimental Th1/Th2 driven enteritis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :8017-8022 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ), and obtained from the Biorepository Core of the NIH-sponsored Cleveland Digestive Diseases Research Center (DDRCC) and the Endoscopy Unit of the first Department of Internal Medicine, Propaedeutic, at Laikon Hospital (Athens, Greece). Samples were taken from areas with evident macroscopic inflammation (involved), and normal-appearing mucosa (non-involved), with confirmed histopathologic diagnoses of either CD or UC. Patients undergoing therapeutic bowel resection for malignant and other non-malignant, non-inflammatory conditions and individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy, who did not display endoscopic and histopathological mucosal abnormalities, served as controls. Age and sex of subjects can be found in Table S2 . Tissues were used for: IHC, as described below, cultivation of colonic epithelial organoids, as described below, or maintained at either 4°C for 1-2d in RNAl ater TM solution until further processing or storage at -80°C, and subsequently used for total RNA isolation/qPCR and protein extraction. All studies were approved by the appropriate Ethics Committees of the Cleveland DDRCC, Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), and Laikon Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
HT-29 cells (human; sex: female, colonic epithelial) were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium modified with L-glutamine and sodium bicarbonate, supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293T cells (human; sex: female, kidney epithelial) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% SuperCalf serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Intestinal epithelial organoids were derived from the colon of IBD and control patients as previously described ( Sarvestani et al., 2018 57. Sarvestani, S.K. ∙ Signs, S.A. ∙ Lefebvre, V. ... Cancer-predicting transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures revealed for ulcerative colitis in patient-derived epithelial organoids Oncotarget. 2018; 9 :28717-28730 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ); age and sex of subjects can be found in Table S2 . Organoid cultures were cultivated in Matrigel® using 50% Advanced DMEM and 50% conditioned media, conditioned by Wnt3a, R-spondin 3 and Noggin (L-WRN) L-cells, prepared according to ( Miyoshi and Stappenbeck, 2013 40. Miyoshi, H. ∙ Stappenbeck, T.S. In vitro expansion and genetic modification of gastrointestinal stem cells in spheroid culture Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2471-2482 Crossref Scopus (498) PubMed Google Scholar ) Generation and maintenance of 2D monolayers from 3D organoids were followed as previously described ( Reed et al., 2019 51. Reed, M. ∙ Luissint, A.-C. ∙ Azcutia, V. ... Epithelial CD47 is critical for mucosal repair in the murine intestine in vivo Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5004 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), and used for subsequent functional assays. All cell lines were grown at 37°C under 5% CO 2 . Cell lines were authenticated by STR profiling and assayed for mycoplasma contamination using LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit.
HT-29 cells or colonic epithelial organoids were grown to 70% confluency in complete media, with or without either; Mtx (10uM/mL for 24h), human recombinant (hr)IFNγ (10ng/mL for 24h), hrTGFβ, hrTNF (both at 50ng/mL for 12h), hrIL-33 (100ng/mL for 6h), flagellin (500ng/mL for 6h), DSS (2% for 4h), ZINC40099027 (10nM for 24h) or hrPDGF-AA (10ng/mL for 24h). Serum starved cells (2h) were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL for 4h), followed by nigericin (10μM for 1.5h) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 1% FBS and MEM Amino Acid Solution. Supernatants were immediately collected, aliquoted and frozen at -20°C for subsequent assays; cells were harvested for total RNA or protein extraction as described below.
Gut mucosal biopsies (collected as previously described) were rinsed, examined for gross morphological changes, and a representative full-thickness sample was obtained. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate for 24h at RT, followed by dehydration in 3 separate 70% ethanol washes, and subsequently stored in 70% ethanol for 2-7d. Samples were then embedded in paraffin and resulting blocks were stored at room temperature for later tissue sectioning. Five-micron-thick serial sections were obtained and mounted on poly-L-lysine coated Superfrost/Plus glass slides. Slides were heated to 60°C for 20 min, followed by two 5-min washes in xylene to deparaffinize and single 5 min washes in 100%, 95%, 70% to dehydrate. Tissue sections were then permeabilized for 30 min with saponin buffer (0.5% saponin in PBS) and blocked for endogenous peroxidase using 1% H 2 O 2 in saponin buffer for 30 min. Sections were blocked for 30 min with normal goat serum for 30 min and incubated with primary GSDMB antibody overnight at 4°C. The following day, slides were washed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min, followed by avidin-biotin complex (ABC) for 30 min. Reactive cells were visualized by adding diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate and counterstained with hematoxylin. Protocol was followed as previously described ( Pastorelli et al., 2010 47. Pastorelli, L. ∙ Garg, R.R. ∙ Hoang, S.B. ... Epithelial-derived IL-33 and its receptor ST2 are dysregulated in ulcerative colitis and in experimental Th1/Th2 driven enteritis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :8017-8022 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). IHC stained slide images were obtained on an Olympus VS120-S6-W Virtual Slide Microscope. Immunofluorescent labeling for confocal imaging of tissue sections, HT-29 cell monolayers (grown to 100% confluency on glass coverslips) or epithelial monolayer derived from 3D colonoids (described above) was completed as described, with the exception of using an appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody; key resource table. Confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope and subsequently processed using Adobe Photoshop.
Total RNA was harvested from HT-29 cells and colonoids using High Pure RNA Isolation Kits and from endoscopic biopsies and freshly isolated IECs using the AllPrep® DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kits both per manufacturers’ protocols. Total RNA was stored at -80°C until 1ug was reverse-transcribed using High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA TM Kits. cDNA was diluted 4-fold in RT-PCR grade water and stored at -20°C until use. Real-time qPCR was performed using Taqman gene-expressing assays and FastStart Universal Probe Master (ROX); key resource table, as previously described ( Lopetuso et al., 2018 34. Lopetuso, L.R. ∙ De Salvo, C. ∙ Pastorelli, L. ... IL-33 promotes recovery from acute colitis by inducing miR-320 to stimulate epithelial restitution and repair Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018; 115 :E9362-E9370 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ) or as outlined by manufacturer on QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR Systems under ΔΔCT run method. Values were calculated as ratio of GSDMB/GAPDH (housekeeping gene) and expressed as fold-differences vs. Cont. for all experiments.
WCLs were prepared and run as previously described ( Bulek et al., 2020 6. Bulek, K. ∙ Zhao, J. ∙ Liao, Y. ... Epithelial-derived gasdermin D mediates nonlytic IL-1β release during experimental colitis J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :4218-4234 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ) using AllPrep® DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kits and subcellular fractions using Cell Fractionation Kits, both per manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of protein was completed using Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay Kits. WCL protein for Phospho-FAK analysis was extracted and prepped as described above, except using PhosphoSafe TM Extraction Reagent instead of RIPA. Digital blot exposures were analyzed using ImageQuant TM LAS 4000 and densitometry calculated using Image J software.
Total DNA was harvested from endoscopic biopsies using AllPrep® DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kits 80004. DNA was quantified by NanoDrop TM spectrophotometry and subsequently used for analysis by commercially available TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assay single-tube assays using TaqMan® Genotyping Master Mix and specific, predesigned SNP primers for position 299 and 306; key resource table, as per manufacturer’s protocol. Results were analyzed using TaqMan® Genotyper Software.
Guide RNA plasmids were generated ( Figure S3 ) as previously described ( Ran et al., 2013 49. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7792) PubMed Google Scholar ), and synthesized by Millipore Sigma with the following modifications: NEB Buffer 2.0 was supplemented instead of Tango Buffer and px459 (Puro) plasmid was used. Constructs were transformed into DH5-α and sequenced to confirm colonies. Lipofectamine TM 3000 was used per manufacturer’s instruction for transfection of HT-29 cells with 6:1 and 3:2 ratios of Lipofectamine to plasmid, respectively. HT-29 cells were selected with G418 for 5d, with surviving cells used in serial dilutions to be screened as individual clones. Clones were TA cloned using pGEM-T and sequenced for deletion confirmation. A second round of transfection from Lipofectamine TM 3000 onward was employed to remove the third allele. GSDMB KD of colonoids employed commercially available shRNA knockdown lentiviral vector for h GSDMB ; key resource table. Puromycin selection was used as previously described ( Miyoshi and Stappenbeck, 2013 40. Miyoshi, H. ∙ Stappenbeck, T.S. In vitro expansion and genetic modification of gastrointestinal stem cells in spheroid culture Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2471-2482 Crossref Scopus (498) PubMed Google Scholar ) to select for GSDMB deficient colonoid cultures.
GSDMB, pMD2.G #12259 and psPAX #12260 were a gift from Didier Trono. Gibson assembly was used to subclone GSDMD-NT, GSDMB-NT, and GSDMB-FL into transient or lentiviral vectors ( Figure S4 ). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create R299G and S306P polymorphisms ( Figure S3 ). All constructs were Sanger-sequence verified. HEK293T cells were seeded overnight in 6-well plates and transfected using calcium phosphate with 1, 2 or 4 μg of plasmid DNA. Four hours post transfection, cells were washed with PBS and changed into fresh media. For lentiviral production, lentiviral plasmids, pMD2.G, and PsPax, were transfected in a 4:3:1.2 ratio in HEK293T cells. After 2d of virus production, supernatant was collected, cleared by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.45μm filter. GSDMB -/- HT-29 cells were incubated with viral supernatants for 2d with Polybrene transfection reagent (10μg/mL) and selected in G418 (750 μg/mL).
LDH release was analyzed using cyQUANT TM LDH Cytotoxicity Assay as per manufacturer’s protocol. Percent cell death was calculated by LDH release = (sample – untreated) / (maximum – untreated) x 100.
1μg/mL PI or 0.5 μg/mL SYTOX TM deep red was added to cells or intact 3D colonoids seeded in 6-well plates. PI was read twice on a SpectraMax i3x Multimode microplate reader at 533/617 (excitation/emission), maximum fluorescence was obtained by using lysed plate. Relative PI uptake was calculated using background (untreated) and maximum fluorescence, and calculated as percent PI uptake = (sample - background) / (maximum – background) x 100. Images for SYTOX were acquired 15 min after dye uptake at 660/682 (excitation/emission) with brightfield overlay using a Keyence Microscope.
3D colonoids were seeded at a consistent density for all groups and treated with 10μM EdU for 2h incubated at 37°C. Media was removed to add ice-cold PBS to dissolve Matrigel®, followed by harvesting of colonoids into microcentrifuge tubes. Subsequently, protocol outlined by manufacturer for Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation Kit was followed, with images of stained cells captured at 650/670 (excitation/emission) with brightfield overlay on a Keyence Microscope.
Cells were seeded at a density of 1 x 10 6 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates. Cells were counted each day over a course of 3d by staining with trypan blue 0.4% and counting viable cells using a hemocytometer. Untreated control was set as baseline.
Protocol was followed as previously described ( Lechuga et al., 2019 29. Lechuga, S. ∙ Amin, P.H. ∙ Wolen, A.R. ... Adducins inhibit lung cancer cell migration through mechanisms involving regulation of cell-matrix adhesion and cadherin-11 expression Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2019; 1866 :395-408 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) using HT-29 cells. Cells were detached from the plate using TrypLE Express solution, resuspended in serum-free media and counted to be added in consistent numbers per upper well chamber of a Transwell® 6.5mm membrane inserts with 0.8μm pores. Membrane inserts were coated with 15μg.cm 2 of collagen I a day prior. Complete media containing 10% FBS as a chemoattractant was added to the lower chamber and cells were allowed to migrate for 12h or 16h at 37°C. Membrane inserts were fixed with methanol and non-migrated cells were removed from the top of the filter using a cotton swab. Cells that remained at bottom of filter, or within membranes, were labeled with ProLong TM Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI and visualized by a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.
Protocol was followed as previously described ( Lechuga et al., 2019 29. Lechuga, S. ∙ Amin, P.H. ∙ Wolen, A.R. ... Adducins inhibit lung cancer cell migration through mechanisms involving regulation of cell-matrix adhesion and cadherin-11 expression Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2019; 1866 :395-408 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) using HT-29 cells. Cells were detached from the plate, resuspended in complete media, and counted to be added in consistent numbers to each well of a 24-well plate coated with collagen I (coated a day prior). Cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37°C, followed by vacuum aspiration of unattached cells. Wells were then gently washed with HBSS buffer. Remaining cells were fixed with methanol and stained using Crystal Violet Cytotoxicity Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions, and visualized using an Axiophot microscope, captured on an Axiocam, and assembled on an Axiovision Release 4.5. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop, counted using the Image J software on a 20x20mm 2 area.
HT-29 cells were counted and seeded at a density of 1 x 10 6 into each chamber of a two silicone chamber Culture-Insert 2, placed in a 35mm μ-Dish and incubated overnight at 37°C. Silicone inserts were then removed by sterile forceps, monolayers washed with PBS followed by addition of complete media to dishes. Prior to image acquisition (acquired daily over 3d), old media was removed, monolayers washed with PBS and fresh complete media was added. Images were obtained using an Axiophot microscope, captured on an Axiocam, assembled on an Axiovision Release 4.5, with the distance between leading edges calculated using Image J. The same aforementioned protocol was used with intestinal epithelial organoids, with the additional step of transforming 3D colonoids into 2D monolayers as described above.
Protocol was followed as previously described ( Lechuga et al., 2019 29. Lechuga, S. ∙ Amin, P.H. ∙ Wolen, A.R. ... Adducins inhibit lung cancer cell migration through mechanisms involving regulation of cell-matrix adhesion and cadherin-11 expression Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2019; 1866 :395-408 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) with HT-29 monolayers cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips that were mechanically-induced scratch wounded using a 200μl pipette tip, followed by fixation with 4% PFA for 20 min at RT and permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Scratched monolayers were then blocked with HBSS containing 1% BSA for 1h at RT followed by 1h incubation with primary antibodies and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution; key resources table . Fluorescently labelled cell monolayers were captured on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop. The same aforementioned protocol was used with intestinal epithelial organoids, with the additional step of transforming 3D colonoids into 2D monolayers as described above.
For microarray analysis, R package GEOquery ( Davis and Meltzer, 2007 16. Davis, S. ∙ Meltzer, P.S. GEOquery: a bridge between the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and BioConductor Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :1846-1847 Crossref Scopus (1791) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to download gene array expression data from GSE database accessions GSE20881 ( Noble et al., 2010 43. Noble, C.L. ∙ Abbas, A.R. ∙ Lees, C.W. ... Characterization of intestinal gene expression profiles in Crohnʼs disease by genome-wide microarray analysis Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2010; 16 :1717-1728 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ), and GSE53306 ( Zhao et al., 2015 73. Zhao, X. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Zhi, F. ... Mobilization of epithelial mesenchymal transition genes distinguishes active from inactive lesional tissue in patients with ulcerative colitis Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24 :4615-4624 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ambiguous and control probes were filtered out from each data set (presented as log 2 M). limma R package ( Ritchie et al., 2015 53. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21729) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to fit generalized linear models for each cohort and the empirical Bayes variance moderation method was used to estimate moderate t statistics and P -values. For scRNA-Seq analysis, 10x Genomics single-cell data were processed as previously described ( Parikh et al., 2019 45. Parikh, K. ∙ Antanaviciute, A. ∙ Fawkner-Corbett, D. ... Colonic epithelial cell diversity in health and inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2019; 567 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ). Normalized single-cell expression values were visualized using Seurat package ( Butler et al., 2018 7. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6227) PubMed Google Scholar ), with data embeddings generated as previously described ( Parikh et al., 2019 45. Parikh, K. ∙ Antanaviciute, A. ∙ Fawkner-Corbett, D. ... Colonic epithelial cell diversity in health and inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2019; 567 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pseudo-bulk analyses were carried out as follows: epithelial cell populations were isolated in silico , discarding contaminating immune types, and a pseudo-bulk for each sample was generated by aggregating raw unique molecular identifier counts from selected cellular barcodes for each subpopulation. DESeq2 R package ( Love et al., 2014 35. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48497) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to compute library size factors, normalize data, and perform differential expression analysis using negative binomial Wald’s test. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to estimate (FDR), and q-values using R package qvalue. For RNA-Seq, sequencing reads generated from the Illumina platform were assessed for quality and trimmed for adapter sequences using TrimGalore! v0.4.2 (Babraham Bioinformatics), a wrapper script for FastQC and cutadapt. Reads that passed quality control were then aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using STAR aligner v2.5.3 ( Dobin et al., 2013 19. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27081) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignment for sequences were guided using GENCODE annotation for GRCh38, with aligned reads analyzed for differential expression using Cufflinks v2.2.1 ( Trapnell et al., 2010 65. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (11853) PubMed Google Scholar ), a RNASeq analysis package that reports fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) for each gene. Differential analysis report was generated using the cuffdiff command performed in a pairwise manner for each group. Differential genes were identified using a significance cutoff of q-value < 0.05. For enriched gene pathway analysis, biological process Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of significantly upregulated genes in each cluster of UC IECs was performed using the R package clusterProfiler ( Yu et al., 2012 70. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.-G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes Among gene clusters Omics J. Integr. Biol. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (18538) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment and an FDR cut-off of 0.05, using all expressed/detected genes as background control. Results are visualized as dotplots using clusterProfiler and ggplot2 R packages.
Quantification of Western blot densitometry was performed by pixel density using ImageJ. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9. Selection of appropriate statistical tests was based on variance and underlying distribution of data. Global effects between groups were first assessed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Differences between individual groups were directly compared as indicated in each figure legend, with P < 0.05 considered significant.
