Title: A midbrain-thalamus-cortex circuit reorganizes cortical dynamics to initiate movement


Abstract: Summary

Motor behaviors are often planned long before execution but only released after specific sensory events. Planning and execution are each associated with distinct patterns of motor cortex activity. Key questions are how these dynamic activity patterns are generated and how they relate to behavior. Here, we investigate the multi-regional neural circuits that link an auditory “Go cue” and the transition from planning to execution of directional licking. Ascending glutamatergic neurons in the midbrain reticular and pedunculopontine nuclei show short latency and phasic changes in spike rate that are selective for the Go cue. This signal is transmitted via the thalamus to the motor cortex, where it triggers a rapid reorganization of motor cortex state from planning-related activity to a motor command, which in turn drives appropriate movement. Our studies show how midbrain can control cortical dynamics via the thalamus for rapid and precise motor behavior.

Section: Introduction

Many behaviors, including purposeful movements, are composed of sequential phases that require different computations. For example, while waiting at a red light to make a turn, we plan to rotate the steering wheel while pressing the gas pedal. After the signal turns green, we achieve our goal by executing a program of skilled movements effortlessly. The planning and execution phases are produced by distinct patterns of neuronal activity ( Svoboda and Li, 2018 108. Svoboda, K. ∙ Li, N.

In laboratory decision-making tasks, behavior-related neural activity rapidly switches from one pattern to another at the appropriate time, often guided by contextual cues ( Funahashi et al., 1989 30.

Planned movements that are released by a contextual “Go cue” are faster and more precise than unplanned movements ( Hanes and Schall, 1996 43. Hanes, D.P. ∙ Schall, J.D.

Planned movements are anticipated by slowly varying neuronal activity in multiple connected brain areas, including the motor cortex (MCx), non-sensory thalamus, and others ( Tanji and Evarts, 1976 112.

This “preparatory activity” encodes specific upcoming movements, often seconds before movement onset ( Tanji and Evarts, 1976 112. Tanji, J. ∙ Evarts, E.V. Anticipatory activity of motor cortex neurons in relation to direction of an intended movement J. Neurophysiol. 1976; 39 :1062-1068 Crossref Scopus (355) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cortical activity then changes rapidly and profoundly just before movement onset ( Guo et al., 2014b 41. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Li, N. ∙ Huber, D. ...

Recordings from large populations of neurons have enabled state space analysis of neural activity ( Laurent, 2002 65. Laurent, G. Olfactory network dynamics and the coding of multidimensional signals Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3 :884-895 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stopfer et al., 2003 107. Stopfer, M. ∙ Jayaraman, V. ∙ Laurent, G. Intensity versus Identity Coding in an Olfactory System Neuron. 2003; 39 :991-1004 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ). With n recorded neurons, population activity can be represented as a trajectory in n -dimensional activity space. These trajectories are typically confined to a low-dimensional manifold, defined by several “activity modes” that explain a significant proportion of the population activity. Activity modes can be obtained by projecting neural activity along specific directions in neural state space, or similar dimensionality reduction methods ( Cunningham and Yu, 2014 14.

A successful decomposition of neural activity provides activity modes that are interpretable, by predicting specific aspects of behavior and revealing related neural computations ( Mante et al., 2013 76.

For example, during motor planning, preparatory activity in MCx occupies an activity mode that discriminates future movement types. This activity mode follows attractor dynamics and funnels preparatory activity to an initial condition (a fixed point) appropriate to trigger accurate and rapid movements ( Churchland et al., 2010 11.

Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Fontolan, L. ∙ Romani, S. ... Discrete attractor dynamics underlies persistent activity in the frontal cortex Nature. 2019; 566 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the Go cue, the dynamics in MCx shows large changes. The motor planning mode collapses ( Funahashi et al., 1989 30. Funahashi, S. ∙ Bruce, C.J. ∙ Goldman-Rakic, P.S.

Neurosci. 2014; 17 :440-448 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a new activity mode with multi-phasic dynamics emerges ( Churchland et al., 2012 10. Churchland, M.M. ∙ Cunningham, J.P. ∙ Kaufman, M.T. ... Neural population dynamics during reaching Nature. 2012; 487 :51-56 Crossref Scopus (649) PubMed Google Scholar ). This movement-type-specific mode is preferentially represented in the descending MCx neurons that project to premotor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord ( Li et al., 2015 69. Li, N. ∙ Chen, T.-W. ∙ Guo, Z.V. ... A motor cortex circuit for motor planning and movement Nature. 2015; 519 :51-56 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ; Economo et al., 2018 22.

Duan, C.A. ∙ Pagan, M. ∙ Piet, A.T. ... Collicular circuits for flexible sensorimotor routing Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24 :1110-1120 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ) and presumably serves as part of a motor command to initiate a specific movement. Another activity mode after the Go cue consists of changes that are invariant to the movement type (condition-invariant signal; Kaufman et al., 2016 57. Kaufman, M.T. ∙ Seely, J.S. ∙ Sussillo, D. ... The largest response component in the motor cortex reflects movement timing but not movement type eNeuro. 2016; 3 ENEURO.0085-16.2016 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), referred to here as “Go cue direction” ( D go ) mode. Altogether, when an animal releases a planned action following a Go cue, neuronal activity in MCx transforms from a motor planning mode (i.e., preparatory activity) to a motor command mode and a D go mode. These modes occupy near-orthogonal subspaces, which may explain in part why movements are not triggered during planning ( Kaufman et al., 2014 56. Kaufman, M.T. ∙ Churchland, M.M. ∙ Ryu, S.I. ...

Neuronal dynamics underlying motor planning and execution have been studied in non-human primates and rodents trained in delayed-response tasks ( Funahashi et al., 1989 30.

An instruction informs movement type (e.g., movement direction or target; eye, tongue, arm, or orienting movements) and a Go cue after a delay releases planned actions and thereby movement onset. The anterior lateral motor (ALM) cortex, a part of MCx, is necessary for motor planning and execution of directional licking in mice ( Komiyama et al., 2010 62.

Bollu, T. ∙ Ito, B.S. ∙ Whitehead, S.C. ... Cortex-dependent corrections as the tongue reaches for and misses targets Nature. 2021; 594 :82-87 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stimulation of ALM triggers rhythmic licking ( Komiyama et al., 2010 62. Komiyama, T. ∙ Sato, T.R. ∙ O’Connor, D.H. ... Learning-related fine-scale specificity imaged in motor cortex circuits of behaving mice Nature. 2010; 464 :1182-1186 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2015 69. Li, N. ∙ Chen, T.-W. ∙ Guo, Z.V. ... A motor cortex circuit for motor planning and movement Nature. 2015; 519 :51-56 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ). ALM forms reciprocal connections with parts of the thalamus (referred to as ALM-projecting thalamus, or thal ALM ) to maintain the motor plan ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thal ALM receives input from the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and the midbrain, which directly or indirectly receive input from ALM ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ,2018). Thus, thal ALM is a hub linking subcortical structures and ALM, forming multi-regional loops essential for orofacial movements.
Here, we mapped the mechanisms underlying cue-triggered switching of activity modes and the resulting movement initiation, in the context of a delayed directional licking task ( Guo et al., 2014b 41. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Li, N. ∙ Huber, D. ... Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice Neuron. 2014; 81 :179-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). By combining anatomy and large-scale electrophysiological recordings, we established that Go-cue-related information flows from the midbrain to ALM via thal ALM , where it initiates D go signals and motor-command-like dynamics in ALM, followed by appropriate movements. Altogether, we have identified a multi-regional pathway mediating cue-triggered mode switching for the release of planned movements.

Section: Results

We studied head-restrained mice performing a delayed-response task ( Guo et al., 2014b 41. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Li, N. ∙ Huber, D. ... Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice Neuron. 2014; 81 :179-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Video S1 ). A tactile stimulus, an object presented to the right whiskers at one of two locations during the sample epoch, instructed lick direction (left or right). Mice were trained to withhold licking during the following delay epoch (1.2 s). After an auditory Go cue (3 or 3.4 kHz, 0.1 s), licking in the correct direction was rewarded. In this task, mice plan upcoming movements during the delay epoch and release planned movements following the Go cue.

We performed extracellular recordings in left ALM (5,136 putative pyramidal neurons). Consistent with previous reports ( Guo et al., 2014b 41. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Li, N. ∙ Huber, D. ... Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice Neuron. 2014; 81 :179-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ; Inagaki et al., 2018 50. Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Inagaki, M. ∙ Romani, S. ... Low-dimensional and monotonic preparatory activity in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :4163-4185 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), ALM neurons showed spike rates selective for lick direction (selectivity; p < 0.05, rank-sum test) during the delay (1,926/5,136 neurons) and the response epochs (2,641/5,136 neurons). An early hypothesis suggested that preparatory activity is a subthreshold version of the activity that later causes the movement ( Tanji and Evarts, 1976 112. Tanji, J. ∙ Evarts, E.V. Anticipatory activity of motor cortex neurons in relation to direction of an intended movement J. Neurophysiol. 1976; 39 :1062-1068 Crossref Scopus (355) PubMed Google Scholar ). This would imply that the Go cue enhances each neuron’s preparatory activity to trigger movement. Some neurons have activity consistent with this view. For example, cell #653 shows delay selectivity, and consistent selectivity peaks after the Go cue ( Figure 1 C). More generally, activity patterns changed qualitatively after the Go cue ( Figures 1 C, S1 A, and S1D) ( Kaufman et al., 2014 56. Kaufman, M.T. ∙ Churchland, M.M. ∙ Ryu, S.I. ... Cortical activity in the null space: permitting preparation without movement Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :440-448 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, cell #2484 shows lick left selectivity during the delay epoch, but the selectivity collapses during the response epoch. In addition, a subset of cells (177/5,136 cells) switched selectivity. The simple notion that preparatory activity is a subthreshold motor command therefore does not explain ALM activity around the time of movement initiation.
To quantify how movement-related selectivity in ALM evolves at a population level we analyzed neural dynamics in activity space ( Cunningham and Yu, 2014 14. Cunningham, J.P. ∙ Yu, B.M. Dimensionality reduction for large-scale neural recordings Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :1500-1509 Crossref Scopus (435) PubMed Google Scholar ). We defined a population selectivity vector: wt = r lick-right, t − r lick-left, t , where r lick-right, t and r lick-left, t are vectors of spike rate of individual neurons for each time t , averaged over lick right and left trials, respectively (the number of elements in the vector equals the number of recorded neurons). Pearson’s correlation of this population selectivity vector is high across time within the delay epoch ( Figure 1 D, a box with white dotted outline), implying that a similar combination of ALM neurons maintains selectivity during motor planning ( Li et al., 2016 70. Li, N. ∙ Daie, K. ∙ Svoboda, K. ... Robust neuronal dynamics in premotor cortex during motor planning Nature. 2016; 532 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ; Economo et al., 2018 22. Economo, M.N. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ∙ Tasic, B. ... Distinct descending motor cortex pathways and their roles in movement Nature. 2018; 563 :79-84 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ; Inagaki et al., 2018 50. Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Inagaki, M. ∙ Romani, S. ... Low-dimensional and monotonic preparatory activity in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :4163-4185 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, population selectivity has a low correlation between time points before and after the Go cue ( Figure 1 D, magenta box), implying that different combinations of neurons show selectivity. Similarly, the population activity of ALM neurons within each trial type ( r lick-right, t , or r lick-left, t ) shows low correlation before versus after the Go cue ( Figure S1 B). Moreover, intracellular recordings of ALM neurons show that membrane conductances increase rapidly after the Go cue, driven by reorganization of synaptic input after the Go cue, which presumably supports the switch in population activity patterns ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Altogether, these results imply that the population activity patterns in ALM change rapidly before and during movement initiation. Similar changes in activity have been observed across species and behavioral tasks ( Funahashi et al., 1989 30. Funahashi, S. ∙ Bruce, C.J. ∙ Goldman-Rakic, P.S.

The stable preparatory activity during the delay epoch ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S1 A, and S1B) suggests a low-dimensional representation of ALM population activity. We defined a delay coding direction CD delay = ̅ 𝑤 𝑡 (−0.6 s < t < 0 s; time to Go cue) as the direction in activity space that discriminates future lick directions (lick left or right) during the delay epoch. Consistent with previous studies, this direction contains almost all movement-direction-selective activity before the Go cue and allows decoding of lick direction one second before movement ( Figures 1 E and S1 I) ( Li et al., 2016 70. Li, N. ∙ Daie, K. ∙ Svoboda, K. ... Robust neuronal dynamics in premotor cortex during motor planning Nature. 2016; 532 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ; Inagaki et al., 2019 49. Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Fontolan, L. ∙ Romani, S. ... Discrete attractor dynamics underlies persistent activity in the frontal cortex Nature. 2019; 566 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, we defined CD response = ̅ 𝑤 𝑡 (0 s < t < 0.4 s; time to Go cue) as a direction that discriminates lick directions after the onset of the Go cue. We orthogonalized CD response to CD delay to isolate activity patterns that emerge after the Go cue ( Economo et al., 2018 22. Economo, M.N. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ∙ Tasic, B. ... Distinct descending motor cortex pathways and their roles in movement Nature. 2018; 563 :79-84 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S1 G and S1H). Activity along CD response contains a large proportion of direction-selective activity and allows decoding of movement ( Figures 1 E and S1 I–S1K). These two modes together explain 71.2 (65.3–76.0) % (mean, 2.5%–97.5% confidence interval) of selectivity in ALM around the movement initiation (±200 ms from the Go cue; Figure 1 F, cyan line).
Activity projected onto CD delay and CD response is correlated at the level of single trials ( Figure S1 L). This implies that information carried along CD delay is transferred to CD response following the Go cue (i.e., trials with strong activity along CD delay have strong activity along CD response , and vice versa). This finding is consistent with the observation that fine-scale movement parameters and reaction times are coded in preparatory activity (unpublished observations) ( Li et al., 2016 70. Li, N. ∙ Daie, K. ∙ Svoboda, K. ... Robust neuronal dynamics in premotor cortex during motor planning Nature. 2016; 532 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ; Even-Chen et al., 2019 26. Even-Chen, N. ∙ Sheffer, B. ∙ Vyas, S. ... Structure and variability of delay activity in premotor cortex PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15 , e1006808 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) and implies that ALM preparatory activity (activity along CD delay ) contributes to control of future movements (activity along CD response ).
We also find phasic non-selective activity after the Go cue in ALM (e.g., cell #2583 in Figure 1 C). At the population level we defined a direction that discriminates activity before and after the Go cue, D go = r after Go cue − r before Go cue , averaged over all correct trials (100-ms time window). Activity along D go explains a large proportion of ALM activity after the Go cue ( Figure S1 I), similar to the “condition-invariant signal” described in a primate reaching task ( Kaufman et al., 2016 57. Kaufman, M.T. ∙ Seely, J.S. ∙ Sussillo, D. ... The largest response component in the motor cortex reflects movement timing but not movement type eNeuro. 2016; 3 ENEURO.0085-16.2016 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Activity along D go is non-selective ( Figure 1 E) and cannot decode lick direction ( Figure S1 J) because activity changes around the Go cue are largely similar across trial types ( Figure S1 C). The trial-type differences that do exist contribute to CD response . These three directions in activity space, together with a fourth direction that captures non-selective ramping activity during the delay epoch ( Li et al., 2016 70. Li, N. ∙ Daie, K. ∙ Svoboda, K. ... Robust neuronal dynamics in premotor cortex during motor planning Nature. 2016; 532 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ; Inagaki et al., 2018 50.

Neurosci. 2018; 38 :4163-4185 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), account for nearly all (87.4%, 84.8%–89.6%; mean, 2.5%–97.5% confidence interval) of population activity around the Go cue (±200 ms from the Go cue; Figure S1 I, cyan line).
Consistent with single neuron dynamics, activity along D go and CD response changed rapidly after the Go cue (latencies, 20.0 (16–24) ms, 30.4 (18–44) ms, respectively; mean (2.5%–97.5% confidence interval); STAR Methods ; Figure 1 G). These changes precede movement onset (64.3 (56–75) ms; mean (2.5%–97.5% confidence interval); blue dashed line in Figure 1 G). Because activity along D go and CD response precede movement ( Figure S1 K), and because silencing of ALM results in loss of cued licking ( Komiyama et al., 2010 62.

Cortex-dependent corrections as the tongue reaches for and misses targets Nature. 2021; 594 :82-87 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that the mode switch is essential to initiate planned movement. We tested the hypothesis that the Go cue triggers non-selective D go signals in ALM, which then reorganizes movement-type-selective activity from CD delay to CD response to initiate movement.
Our hypothesis predicts that although both D go and CD response appear after the Go cue, they may be dissociable with manipulation of the CD response . We silenced ALM neurons projecting to the medulla (pyramidal tract neurons in lower layer 5b, “PT lower ”) which contribute disproportionately to the CD response ( Economo et al., 2018 22. Economo, M.N. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ∙ Tasic, B. ... Distinct descending motor cortex pathways and their roles in movement Nature. 2018; 563 :79-84 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the medulla contains the motor centers for orofacial movement ( Travers et al., 1997 115. Travers, J.B. ∙ Dinardo, L.A. ∙ Karimnamazi, H. Motor and premotor mechanisms of licking Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1997; 21 :631-647 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stanek et al., 2014 103. Stanek, E.,I.V. ∙ Cheng, S. ∙ Takatoh, J. ... Monosynaptic premotor circuit tracing reveals neural substrates for oro-motor coordination eLife. 2014; 3 , e02511 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), descending signals from ALM to the medulla may be necessary for movement initiation. We injected AAV retro ( Tervo et al., 2016 113. Tervo, D.G.R. ∙ Hwang, B.-Y. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ... A designer AAV variant permits efficient retrograde access to projection neurons Neuron. 2016; 92 :372-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ) encoding soma-targeted (st) GtACR1 ( Govorunova et al., 2015 37.

Commun. 2018; 9 :4125 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the medulla ( Figures 2 A and S2 A; Tables S1 and S3 ). Bilateral optogenetic silencing of PT lower cells in ALM (centered at anterior-posterior [AP] 2.5 mm L 1.5 mm from Bregma; 1 s of photostimulation starting at the onset of Go cue) resulted in a loss of cue-triggered licking ( Figures 2 B, 2C, S2 B, and S2C). Similar bilateral silencing in posterior cortical regions (centered around AP 0 mm L 1.5 mm from Bregma) had a weaker behavioral effect ( Figure S2 C). Following the end of the photostimulus, mice licked in the correct direction ( Figures 2 B and S2 D), implying that activity of ALM PT lower cells is required to initiate movements, but not to maintain motor plans and not for a memory of the Go cue.
We next performed extracellular recordings in ALM during this manipulation, using photostimulation powers that produced significant behavioral effects (0.5 mW; Figure S2 C). Spike rates were altered in 248/899 cells (p < 0.05, rank-sum test; Figures 2 D–2F, S2 E, and S2F). Cells silenced by the photostimulus (150/899) could include PT lower cells and neurons excited by them directly or indirectly ( Figures 2 D–2F; putative PT lower cells), whereas excited cells (129/899) are neurons indirectly inhibited by PT lower cells ( Figures 2 D–2F; PT lower -inhibited cells). Strongly silenced cells (p < 0.001, rank-sum test) were in deep cortical layers (821 ± 185 μm; mean ± SD; 56 cells), consistent with the depths of PT lower cells ( Economo et al., 2018 22. Economo, M.N. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ∙ Tasic, B. ... Distinct descending motor cortex pathways and their roles in movement Nature. 2018; 563 :79-84 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The PT lower silencing attenuated activity along CD response in lick right trials (when recording in the left hemisphere), without affecting activity along D go ( Figures 2 G and S2 J). The contralateral reduction in CD response does not simply reflect silencing of PT lower cells but is a network effect. First, PT lower cells are a small proportion of ALM neurons and thus make a correspondingly small contribution to CD response ( Figure S2 A) ( Economo et al., 2018 22. Economo, M.N. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ∙ Tasic, B. ... Distinct descending motor cortex pathways and their roles in movement Nature. 2018; 563 :79-84 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, putative PT lower cells do not have strong contralateral selectivity on average, and the extent of silencing is equal between trial types (i.e., no contralateral bias in putative PT lower cells; Figures S2 F and S2G). Third, CD response based on non-PT lower cells alone shows a contralateral reduction in CD response activity during PT lower silencing ( Figure S2 G). Although PT lower cells have only weak connections with other pyramidal cells ( Brown and Hestrin, 2009 7. Brown, S.P. ∙ Hestrin, S. Intracortical circuits of pyramidal neurons reflect their long-range axonal targets Nature. 2009; 457 :1133-1136 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kiritani et al., 2012 59. Kiritani, T. ∙ Wickersham, I.R. ∙ Seung, H.S. ... Hierarchical connectivity and connection-specific dynamics in the corticospinal-corticostriatal microcircuit in mouse motor cortex J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :4992-5001 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), they may influence the network via their connections to local GABAergic interneurons or through multi-regional loops ( Svoboda and Li, 2018 108. Svoboda, K. ∙ Li, N. Neural mechanisms of movement planning: motor cortex and beyond Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2018; 49 :33-41 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). These experiments imply that D go develops independent of CD response .
Additional support for distinct roles of D go and CD response comes from analysis of trials in which mice failed to lick after the Go cue (no response trials; mostly near the end of a session when they are satiated). Activity along CD delay is attenuated during the delay epoch in these trials likely modulated by the motivational state of the animal ( Allen et al., 2019 1. Allen, W.E. ∙ Chen, M.Z. ∙ Pichamoorthy, N. ... Thirst regulates motivated behavior through modulation of brainwide neural population dynamics Science. 2019; 364 :253 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2 I and S2J). Although activity along D go increases, activity along CD response does not develop after the Go cue ( Figures S2 I and S2J). Thus, even when activity along D go appears after the Go cue, without properly developed motor planning ( CD delay ), activity along CD response does not emerge.
These experiments together show that descending output from PT lower cells is required for movement initiation. Furthermore, activity along CD response , which is encoded by PT lower and other cells ( Economo et al., 2018 22. Economo, M.N. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ∙ Tasic, B. ... Distinct descending motor cortex pathways and their roles in movement Nature. 2018; 563 :79-84 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ), instructs lick direction and develops before movement execution. These results are consistent with a view that activity along CD response is part of the motor command for directional licking.
In contrast, activity along D go precedes movement but it is not instructive on movement type or sufficient to trigger movement by itself (without a change in activity along CD response ). Thus, activity along D go is not a motor command. Instead, D go may trigger the activity along CD response following the Go cue. Testing this hypothesis requires manipulations of activity along D go by activating or inhibiting neurons that carry this signal. This requires mapping the pathways that transmit Go-cue-related signals to ALM.
To explore the causal chain of events leading from an auditory Go cue to movement initiation, we analyzed rapid changes in activity after the Go cue and compared latencies across brain areas. ALM forms strong reciprocal connections with thal ALM , including parts of the ventral medial (VM), ventral anterolateral (VAL), mediodorsal (MD), paracentral (PCN), central lateral (CL), central medial (CM), and parafascicular (PF) nuclei of the thalamus ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). The PCN, CL, CM, and PF comprise the so-called intralaminar (IL) nuclei of the thalamus.
We performed extracellular recordings in thal ALM and compared responses to the Go cue (i.e., changes in spike rate after the Go cue) with those in ALM ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S3 , and S5 ). Neurons in ALM and thal ALM responded with increases or decreases in spike rate (go-up and go-down cells, respectively). The latency was shorter in thalamus (16.5 ± 1.5 ms; mean ± SEM; time when 1% of cells show increase in spike rate) compared with ALM (25.0 ± 0.8 ms; mean ± SEM) (p < 0.001; bootstrap; Figures 3 A and 3B). The latency difference between thal ALM and ALM is consistent with the action potential propagation speed in thalamocortical axons ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neurons with short latencies (<20 ms) were widespread in thal ALM , and appeared to be partially spatially segregated from delay-selective neurons ( Figure 3 C; 5.4% of thal ALM cells with delay selectivity had short latency) ( Gaidica et al., 2018 31. Gaidica, M. ∙ Hurst, A. ∙ Cyr, C. ... Distinct populations of motor thalamic neurons encode action initiation, action selection, and movement vigor J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :6563-6573 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed similar short latency activity in thal ALM of mice performing an auditory delayed-response task ( Figure S3 ) ( Inagaki et al., 2018 50. Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Inagaki, M. ∙ Romani, S. ... Low-dimensional and monotonic preparatory activity in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :4163-4185 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Photoinhibition of ALM reduced the activity of thal ALM during the delay epoch ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 D, 3E, and S3 E) but did not change the amplitude of the Go cue response in thal ALM , although the photoinhibition lasts until the response epoch ( Figure 3 F). Thus, ALM is not necessary for the Go cue response in thal ALM . Together with the latency analysis, these results indicate that the Go cue activity first arrives in thal ALM , then drives ALM ( Dacre et al., 2021 16. Dacre, J. ∙ Colligan, M. ∙ Clarke, T. ...

Auditory cortex neurons can respond to sounds with short latencies (12 ms; Williamson and Polley, 2019 120. Williamson, R.S. ∙ Polley, D.B. Parallel pathways for sound processing and functional connectivity among layer 5 and 6 auditory corticofugal neurons eLife. 2019; 8 , e42974 Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar ) but do not directly project to ALM ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oh et al., 2014 83. Oh, S.W. ∙ Harris, J.A. ∙ Ng, L. ... A mesoscale connectome of the mouse brain Nature. 2014; 508 :207-214 Crossref Scopus (1206) PubMed Google Scholar ). M1 (AP 0.15 mm, ML 1.7 mm from Bregma) and ALM are bidirectionally connected ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). M1 showed latencies similar to ALM ( Figure S3 ; 20.6 ± 5.1 ms; mean ± SEM; p = 0.41, Bootstrap). Because M1 is not necessary for initiation of directional licking ( Xu et al., 2019 122. Xu, D. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Delgado, A.M. ... A functional cortical network for sensorimotor sequence generation Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/783050 Date: 2019 Google Scholar ), and because of slow propagation of intercortical signals between M1 and ALM ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ), a parsimonious explanation is that the Go cue response in ALM does not rely on M1. Instead, thal ALM is likely a source for the Go cue to ALM.
We injected retrograde tracers in thal ALM (retrobeads and AAV retro ; Figures S4 A–S4C), which revealed inputs from ipsilateral frontal cortex and multiple subcortical areas, including the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), superior colliculus (SC), deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), and PPN/MRN ( Figures S4 A–S4C) ( Saper and Loewy, 1982 94.

To map the projections from these subcortical areas within thal ALM and beyond, we injected AAVs expressing fluorescent proteins in each area ( Figures 4 A and S4 D; Table S2 ). PPN/MRN neurons have widespread projections to thal ALM , whereas other structures have relatively localized projections ( Figure 4 B). We focused on PPN/MRN because their output overlaps with the short latency Go cue responses in thal ALM ( Figure S4 F).
Thalamus-projecting PPN/MRN (PPN/MRN Th ) neurons are distributed across a region referred to as the “mesencephalic locomotor region” (MLR) ( Shik et al., 1966 99. Shik, M.L. ∙ Severin, F.V. ∙ Orlovskiĭ, G.N. [Control of walking and running by means of electric stimulation of the midbrain] Biofizika. 1966; 11 :659-666 PubMed Google Scholar ). Stimulation of the MLR produces locomotion, mediated by glutamatergic neurons that descend into the medulla ( Shik et al., 1966 99. Shik, M.L. ∙ Severin, F.V. ∙ Orlovskiĭ, G.N. [Control of walking and running by means of electric stimulation of the midbrain] Biofizika. 1966; 11 :659-666 PubMed Google Scholar ; Roseberry et al., 2016 90.

Midbrain circuits that set locomotor speed and gait selection Nature. 2018; 553 :455-460 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). PPN/MRN neurons in mice project to both thalamus and the medulla ( Figure 4 C). To label PPN/MRN Th neurons specifically, we injected AAV retro -Cre in thal ALM , and AAV-FLEX-YFP in PPN/MRN ( Figure 4 D). By injecting a retrograde tracer in ALM of the same animal, we confirmed that projections from PPN/MRN partially overlap with thal ALM ( Figures 4 E and 4F). These experiments revealed that PPN/MRN Th neurons lack a projection to the medulla, and thus constitute a distinct population, intermingled with neurons that project to the medulla ( Figure 4 D). PPN contains a high density of cholinergic ( chat +) cells ( Sofroniew et al., 1985 100. Sofroniew, M.V. ∙ Priestley, J.V. ∙ Consolazione, A. ...

However, the majority (75%) of PPN/MRN Th neurons are glutamatergic ( vglut2 +), not cholinergic or GABAergic ( gad1 +), as confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining ( Figures S4 G–S4J; Table S4 ). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute brain slices confirmed direct glutamatergic input from PPN/MRN to thal ALM neurons ( Figures S4 K–S4Q).
Next, we compared the latencies of Go cue responses across the subcortical areas projecting to thal ALM , including DCN ( Gao et al., 2018 32. Gao, Z. ∙ Davis, C. ∙ Thomas, A.M. ... A cortico-cerebellar loop for motor planning Nature. 2018; 563 :113-116 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ), SNr ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ), SC, and PPN/MRN ( Figure 5 A). We found neurons with fast Go cue responses (<15 ms) in multiple areas: the nucleus of lateral lemniscus (NLL), an auditory center that receives direct input from the cochlear nucleus ( Davis et al., 1982 17.

Neurosci. 1982; 2 :791-805 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ); the pontine reticular nucleus (PRN), part of the acoustic startle pathway ( Davis et al., 1982 17. Davis, M. ∙ Gendelman, D.S. ∙ Tischler, M.D. ... A primary acoustic startle circuit: lesion and stimulation studies J. Neurosci. 1982; 2 :791-805 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ); the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) ( Figure 5 A; arrowheads; these brain areas do not project to thal ALM directly). In addition, we found cells with short latency Go cue responses in PPN/MRN (white outline; Figures 5 A–5C) ( Reese et al., 1995 87. Reese, N.B. ∙ Garcia-Rill, E. ∙ Skinner, R.D.

We compared the latencies and spike rates after the Go cue across brain areas ( Figures 5 D and S5 ). All thal ALM -projecting subcortical areas contain cells with Go cue latencies shorter than thal ALM . To analyze the latency of the non-selective component of the Go cue response, we projected activity in each area to its D go . Among the thal ALM -projecting areas, PPN/MRN is one of the first where D go emerges after the Go cue ( Figure 5 E; p = 0.07, the probability that PPN/MRN has the shortest latency, hierarchical bootstrap). Unlike activity along D go , the selective component of the Go cue response, i.e., activity along CD response in each brain area, emerged almost simultaneously across brain areas, and later than D go ( Figure 5 F). Thus, following the Go cue, non-selective activity rapidly spreads across brain areas, followed by emergence of selective activity.
The fast Go cue responses in PPN/MRN are not simple auditory responses. Rather, they constitute a learned response that is specific to the sound used as the Go cue. We tested this by recording in mice trained with either 3- or 12-kHz Go cue and trained to ignore the other tone ( Figures 5 G and S5 G). The response does not reflect timing of the task because there was no response without the Go cue ( Figure 5 G). Responses in thal ALM were also specific to the Go cue, with no response to the other tone, consistent with the view that PPN/MRN conveys Go cue signal to thal ALM ( Figures S5 G–S5J).
Since PPN/MRN contains cells with short latencies ( Figures 5 D and 5E), and since their projections overlap with a subregion of thal ALM containing fast Go cue responses ( Figure S4 F), we next tested whether activity in thalamus-projecting PPN/MRN is causal for the cue-triggered activity in ALM and movement initiation.
If PPN/MRN neurons signal the Go cue to ALM via thalamus, phasic optogenetic stimulation of PPN/MRN Th neurons should trigger the effects of the Go cue. To stimulate PPN/MRN Th neurons, we injected ChR2-expressing AAV in PPN/MRN (unilaterally or bilaterally, n = 20 mice) and placed a fiber optic unilaterally in thal ALM for axonal photostimulation ( Figures 6 A and S6 A–S6C) ( Petreanu et al., 2007 86. Petreanu, L. ∙ Huber, D. ∙ Sobczyk, A. ... Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping of long-range callosal projections Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10 :663-668 Crossref Scopus (629) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mimicking the phasic Go cue response with brief (5 or 10 ms) photostimulation of PPN/MRN axons increased licking responses ( Figures 6 B and S6 H; p < 0.001, bootstrap; differences across animals are partially explained by the location of AAV infection and by the evoked activity patterns; Figures S6 D–S6F). Importantly, when mice licked in response to photostimulation, they licked in the correct direction defined by the trial type ( Figure 6 C). This was the case even in mice with unilateral injection of ChR2-expressing AAV in PPN/MRN and ipsilateral photostimulation in thal ALM ( Figure S6 G; n = 3 mice; note that PPN/MRN neurons project to ipsilateral Th, and more weakly to contralateral thalamus; Figure S4 E). Triggering the movement to the instructed direction is precisely what the Go cue does: it does not carry directional information by itself but releases planned movements. This property of PPN/MRN stimulation is unusual, as unilateral stimulation of motor-related cortex and midbrain generally drives contralateral movements ( Li et al., 2015 69.

In addition, photostimulation of PPN/MRN Th neurons induced orofacial movements similar to those triggered by the Go cue ( Figures 1 B and 6 D; Video S2 ). Mice did not initiate movement by anticipating the Go cue timing ( Figure 6 D; Go cue omitted). In trials in which mice did not lick in response to photostimulation, orofacial movements were attenuated ( Figure 6 D; stim, w.o. lick).

We next compared ALM activity with Go cue-triggered licks and PPN/MRN Th stimulation-triggered licks. The changes in activity produced by the Go cue and photostimulation were remarkably similar. In particular, the photostimuli did not merely excite all ALM neurons by increasing glutamatergic input from PPN/MRN Th neurons. Instead, in trials in which mice licked in response to photostimulation, neural activity in ALM resembled activity triggered by the Go cue at the level of individual cells ( Figure S6 I) and at the population level ( Figures S6 J and S6K) by both increasing and decreasing spike rates ( Dacre et al., 2021 16. Dacre, J. ∙ Colligan, M. ∙ Clarke, T. ... A cerebellar-thalamocortical pathway drives behavioral context-dependent movement initiation Neuron. 2021; 109 :2326-2338.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To analyze the population activity pattern, we projected the population activity along CD delay , CD response , and D go . The activity underlying stimulation-triggered licks was similar to that underlying cue-triggered licks. Namely, we observed a significant change in activity along D go and CD response ( Figures 6 E and S6 L). Furthermore, activity along CD delay collapsed after the photostimulation, similar to changes observed after the Go cue ( Figure 6 E). These changes happen before the onset of movement (within 50 ms after the onset of stimulation; Figures S6 L and S6M), implying that they are not caused by the movement. In trials in which mice did not lick in response to photostimulation, changes in activity were much attenuated, consistent with the reduced orofacial movements ( Figures 6 D and 6E). No activity change was observed in Go cue omitted trials consistent with the lack of movement.
The amplitude of activity along D go predicted whether photostimulation triggered licks on a trial-by-trial basis ( Figure S6 N; p < 0.05 in 4 out of 7 sessions). Activity along CD response is determined by both activity along D go and CD delay ( Figures S6 O and S6P). Altogether, when photostimuli induced sufficiently large activity along D go , they create activity along CD response in a manner proportional to the activity along CD delay , which results in licking in the planned direction.
We next tested if PPN/MRN activity is necessary for cue-triggered movement initiation. First, infusion of the GABA A receptor antagonist muscimol bilaterally (2.5–5 ng) in PPN/MRN prevented mice from licking ( Figures S7 A and S7B). To test whether PPN/MRN is required for the Go cue response in ALM, we performed extracellular recordings of ALM during the muscimol infusion. Similar to licking, the Go cue response decreased rapidly after infusion ( Figures S7 C–S7H). Thus, PPN/MRN is required for the Go cue response in ALM and licking.
To perturb PPN/MRN Th neurons in a temporally precise manner, we expressed stGtACR1 in PPN/MRN Th neurons bilaterally by injecting AAV retro -syn-Cre in thalamus and AAV-FLEX-stGtACR1 in PPN/MRN ( Figures 7 A, S8 A, and S8B). Optogenetic perturbation during the Go cue presentation blocked cue-triggered licks ( Figure 7 B; laser was turned on 0.6 s before the Go cue and lasted for 1.2 s; 473 nm 40 Hz sinusoidal). Perturbation of glutamatergic PPN/MRN Th neurons (using AAV retro -CamKII-Cre; Figure S4 H) resulted in a similar behavioral effect ( Figure 7 B; in contrast, perturbation of cholinergic neurons did not affect movement initiation). Even after the end of the perturbation, mice showed reduced licks ( Figure S8 C). Thus, unlike PT lower silencing in which mice licked after silencing ( Figure 2 B), mice behaved as if there was no Go cue.
To measure the effect of the optogenetic manipulation, we performed extracellular recordings in mice expressing stGtACR1 in CamKII+ PPN/MRN Th neurons. A subset of PPN/MRN neurons showed increases in spike rate time-locked to the sinusoidal laser modulation (23/45 cells; p < 0.05, rank-sum test; analyzed cells with latency to the Go cue shorter than 50 ms), likely due to residual axonal excitation caused by stGtACR1 ( Figures 7 C, S2 H, and S8 D) ( Mahn et al., 2018 74. Mahn, M. ∙ Gibor, L. ∙ Patil, P. ... High-efficiency optogenetic silencing with soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsins Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4125 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Messier et al., 2018 80. Messier, J.E. ∙ Chen, H. ∙ Cai, Z.-L. ... Targeting light-gated chloride channels to neuronal somatodendritic domain reduces their excitatory effect in the axon eLife. 2018; 7 , e38506 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, increases in spike rate occurred around and slightly after the peak of the laser power ( Figure S8 F). Other PPN/MRN neurons (13/45; p < 0.05, rank-sum test) were silenced ( Figures 7 C and S8 D). In both cases, the Go cue response was abolished in perturbation trials ( Figures 7 C and S8 D).
Next, we performed extracellular recordings in ALM. Like in PPN/MRN, the Go cue response was eliminated in individual ALM neurons during the perturbation ( Figures 7 C and S8 E). The sinusoidal modulation was attenuated in ALM ( Figure S8 F). ALM neurons showed a loss of Go cue response when Syn+ or CamKII+ PPN/MRN Th neurons were perturbed, but not when ChAT+ PPN/MRN neurons were perturbed, consistent with the behavioral effect ( Figure S8 G).
In activity space, the Go cue response disappeared across all directions ( Figures 7 D and S8 I). In addition to the loss of the Go cue response, the photostimulation onset caused a transient onset response, which was likely induced by stGtACR1-dependent axonal excitation ( Figure 7 E) ( Mahn et al., 2018 74. Mahn, M. ∙ Gibor, L. ∙ Patil, P. ... High-efficiency optogenetic silencing with soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsins Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4125 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Messier et al., 2018 80. Messier, J.E. ∙ Chen, H. ∙ Cai, Z.-L. ... Targeting light-gated chloride channels to neuronal somatodendritic domain reduces their excitatory effect in the axon eLife. 2018; 7 , e38506 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). This excitation did not trigger licks, presumably because the temporal patterns of excitation are different (e.g., much briefer) compared with activity after the Go cue. A question is whether this transient excitation precludes ALM from responding to the Go cue. We addressed this question in three ways. First, logistic regression showed that larger attenuation of the Go cue response corresponds to lower probability of licking ( Figure 7 E). Second, the amplitude of the onset response was not correlated with the loss of the Go cue response ( Figures 7 F and S8 H). Third, presenting a Go cue in the middle of the delay epoch does not preclude mice and ALM activity from responding to another Go cue presented at the end of the delay epoch ( Figures S7 I–S7K). Altogether, a parsimonious explanation is that the perturbation of the Go cue response in PPN/MRN results in a loss of Go cue response in ALM and a loss of movement initiation.

Section: Discussion

ALM activity can be decomposed into several activity modes that capture a large proportion of cortical activity ( Figure 1 ) ( Li et al., 2016 70. Li, N. ∙ Daie, K. ∙ Svoboda, K. ... Robust neuronal dynamics in premotor cortex during motor planning Nature. 2016; 532 :459-464 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ; Inagaki et al., 2018 50. Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Inagaki, M. ∙ Romani, S. ... Low-dimensional and monotonic preparatory activity in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :4163-4185 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the delay epoch, movement-selective preparatory activity is contained mostly in the CD delay mode in activity space. After the Go cue, this activity rapidly reorganizes into the non-selective D go mode and the direction-selective CD response mode. This progression underlies movement initiation.
We identified a multi-regional neural pathway that is critical for reorganizing ALM activity in response to the Go cue and to initiate planned directional licking ( Figure 7 G). Ascending glutamatergic neurons in PPN/MRN signal the Go cue information to ALM via thal ALM and thereby cause the reorganization of ALM activity and release planned movements. Our conclusions are based on multiple lines of evidence. First, PPN/MRN contains neurons that specifically respond to the auditory Go cue (and not to other sounds) ( Figure 5 G). Second, latencies after the Go cue are shorter in PPN/MRN than in thal ALM ( Figure 5 E). Third, PPN/MRN neurons project to areas of thal ALM that show short latency Go cue responses ( Figure 4 ). Fourth, brief optogenetic stimulation of PPN/MRN Th neurons triggers rapid changes in ALM activity, similar to those caused by the Go cue itself ( Figure 6 E). Fifth, optogenetic stimulation of PPN/MRN Th neurons elicited the appropriate directional licking, even after unilateral stimulation of PPN/MRN Th neurons ( Figure 6 C), unlike other thal ALM -projecting areas. Sixth, perturbation of PPN/MRN Th activity resulted in a loss of Go cue response in ALM and abolished behavioral responses ( Figures 7 , S7 , and S8 ). Our findings are consistent with previous experiments in rats, cats, and monkeys, in which lesioning or silencing of PPN/MRN blocks cue-triggered movements ( Wilson, 1973 121. Wilson, P.D.

Neurol. 1973; 40 :424-430 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ; Condé et al., 1998 13. Condé, H. ∙ Dormont, J.F. ∙ Farin, D.

The function of the pedunculopontine nucleus in the preparation and execution of an externally-cued bar pressing task in the rat Behav. Brain Res. 1999; 104 :95-104 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In humans, PPN/MRN and downstream thalamic areas show activity in cued movement tasks ( Kinomura et al., 1996 58. Kinomura, S. ∙ Larsson, J. ∙ Gulyás, B. ... Activation by attention of the human reticular formation and thalamic intralaminar nuclei Science. 1996; 271 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (511) PubMed Google Scholar ).
PPN/MRN receives input from NLL ( Reese et al., 1995 87. Reese, N.B. ∙ Garcia-Rill, E. ∙ Skinner, R.D. The pedunculopontine nucleus—auditory input, arousal and pathophysiology Prog. Neurobiol. 1995; 47 :105-133 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), which itself receives direct auditory input from the cochlear nucleus ( Davis et al., 1982 17. Davis, M. ∙ Gendelman, D.S. ∙ Tischler, M.D. ... A primary acoustic startle circuit: lesion and stimulation studies J. Neurosci. 1982; 2 :791-805 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the latency to the Go cue in NLL is shorter than in PPN/MRN ( Figure 5 ). The auditory response in PPN/MRN is specific to the sound associated as the Go cue ( Figures 5 G and S5 G–S5J). PPN/MRN is likely the site of this association. PPN/MRN also responds to other sensory stimuli ( Pan et al., 2005 85. Pan, W.-X. ∙ Schmidt, R. ∙ Wickens, J.R. ... Dopamine cells respond to predicted events during classical conditioning: evidence for eligibility traces in the reward-learning network J.

Most of our understanding of thalamocortical processing is based on sensory thalamus and cortex. Less is known about non-sensory (“higher-order”) thalamus and its interactions with the frontal cortex. Cortex and higher-order thalamus are coupled in both directions ( Bolkan et al., 2017 4. Bolkan, S.S. ∙ Stujenske, J.M. ∙ Parnaudeau, S. ... Thalamic projections sustain prefrontal activity during working memory maintenance Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :987-996 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ...

Schmitt, L.I. ∙ Wimmer, R.D. ∙ Nakajima, M. ... Thalamic amplification of cortical connectivity sustains attentional control Nature. 2017; 545 :219-223 Crossref Scopus (260) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our experiments suggest that midbrain sends simple contextual signals to the cortex via particular thalamic nuclei to modulate cortical activity modes. Different thalamic nuclei contain neurons with different projection patterns ( Steriade et al., 1997 106. Steriade, M. ∙ Jones, E.G. ∙ McCormick, D.A. Thalamus Elsevier, 1997 Google Scholar ; Clascá et al., 2012 12. Clascá, F. ∙ Rubio-Garrido, P. ∙ Jabaudon, D. Unveiling the diversity of thalamocortical neuron subtypes Eur. J. Neurosci. 2012; 35 :1524-1532 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, VM contains neurons that have broad projection patterns to layer 1 (“matrix”). VAL instead projects in a more focal manner to middle layers (“core”) ( Jones, 1998 51. Jones, E.G. Viewpoint: the core and matrix of thalamic organization Neuroscience. 1998; 85 :331-345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuramoto et al., 2015 64. Kuramoto, E. ∙ Ohno, S. ∙ Furuta, T. ... Ventral medial nucleus neurons send thalamocortical afferents more widely and more preferentially to layer 1 than neurons of the ventral anterior-ventral lateral nuclear complex in the rat Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25 :221-235 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). These different thalamocortical projections activate cortical microcircuits in specific ways ( Anastasiades et al., 2021 2. Anastasiades, P.G. ∙ Collins, D.P. ∙ Carter, A.G. Mediodorsal and ventromedial thalamus engage distinct L1 circuits in the prefrontal cortex Neuron. 2021; 109 :314-330.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). The spatial distribution of thal ALM neurons with short latencies to the Go cue appears to differ from those showing delay selectivity ( Figure 3 C). It will be interesting to learn how the thalamic nuclei showing different activity patterns modulate cortex through their specific thalamocortical projections. We note that the PPN/MRN input to thal ALM produces short latency and reliable synaptic currents with paired-pulse depression ( Figures S4 P and S4Q). Thus, the PPN/MRN Th thal ALM projection has the hallmarks of a classic driver input ( Guillery and Sherman, 2002 38. Guillery, R.W. ∙ Sherman, S.M.

Animal behavior often consists of multiple phases, each corresponding to different computations. Activity modes underlying each phase likely occupy near-orthogonal activity subspaces so that the different computations do not interfere with each other ( Mante et al., 2013 76.

Condition-dependent neural dimensions progressively shift during reach to grasp Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :3158-3168.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the information carried by a mode needs to be transferred to subsequent modes to mediate coherent behavior. For example, information encoded by the preparatory activity must be transferred to the motor command to initiate planned movement. Indeed, we observed correlation between activity along CD delay during the delay epoch and CD response after the Go cue ( Figures S1 L and S6 P).
We designed our optogenetic manipulations to test the causal roles of each activity mode. Silencing PT lower neurons resulted in a loss of movements and reduced activity along CD response , without affecting D go ( Figure 2 G). Optogenetic stimulation of PPN/MRN Th axons first increased activity along the D go . When D go activity was sufficiently large it also induced selective activity along CD response and triggered appropriate behavioral responses ( Figures 6 E and S6 O). Thus, although both CD response and D go emerge after the Go cue, they are dissociable ( Figures 2 and 6 ): activity along D go is not sufficient to trigger movement by itself. Instead, it induces activity along CD response , which then presumably controls the movement via PT lower cells.
Our analysis relies on the millisecond temporal precision provided by electrophysiology and behavioral tracking with high-speed video, as well as a behavioral task with multiple choices. Our results provide a clear demonstration that state space analysis can extract features of population activity that have specific roles in behavior.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients experience difficulty in self-initiating movement, clinically described as freezing of gait (FOG). However, they can often perform complex movements in response to sensory cues, such as catching a ball. This phenomenon, known as paradoxical kinesis, is commonly used for rehabilitation ( Ginis et al., 2018 36. Ginis, P. ∙ Nackaerts, E. ∙ Nieuwboer, A. ...

In addition, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of PPN has been applied to treat the FOG in PD ( Thevathasan and Moro, 2019 114. Thevathasan, W. ∙ Moro, E. What is the therapeutic mechanism of pedunculopontine nucleus stimulation in Parkinson’s disease? Neurobiol. Dis. 2019; 128 :67-74 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). The PPN DBS improves simple reaction tasks ( Thevathasan and Moro, 2019 114. Thevathasan, W. ∙ Moro, E. What is the therapeutic mechanism of pedunculopontine nucleus stimulation in Parkinson’s disease? Neurobiol. Dis. 2019; 128 :67-74 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising a possibility that PPN DBS is acting on the cue-triggered movement initiation mechanism. Further investigation on genetically defined cell types and precise location of PPN/MRN neurons that underlie cue-triggered movement may help to optimize treatment of PD.
Here, we emphasized the PPN/MRN Th → thal ALM → ALM circuit. However, PPN/MRN neurons likely exert their role in movement initiation via additional brain regions. For example, PPN/MRN Th neurons also project to the SNr and subthalamic nucleus (STN) ( Figure 4 A) ( Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2011 77. Martinez-Gonzalez, C. ∙ Bolam, J.P. ∙ Mena-Segovia, J.

STN in turn projects to SNr, and SNr is known to control premotor circuits in the SC and medulla ( DeLong, 1990 18. DeLong, M.R.

What, if, and when to move: basal ganglia circuits and self-paced action initiation Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2019; 42 :459-483 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, PPN/MRN Th neurons may locally excite or inhibit PPN/MRN neurons that descend to motor centers. Indeed, PPN/MRN is ideally positioned to coherently control brain-wide circuits for movement initiation.
Our experiments do not exclude contributions from additional subcortical areas to movement initiation, such as DCN ( Spidalieri et al., 1983 102. Spidalieri, G. ∙ Busby, L. ∙ Lamarre, Y.

Unilateral optogenetic stimulation of DCN in the delayed-response task biased lick direction but did not trigger licks ( Gao et al., 2018 32. Gao, Z. ∙ Davis, C. ∙ Thomas, A.M. ... A cortico-cerebellar loop for motor planning Nature. 2018; 563 :113-116 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, in a cued reaching task, DCN activity is causal for the movement initiation and activity in MCx ( Dacre et al., 2021 16. Dacre, J. ∙ Colligan, M. ∙ Clarke, T. ... A cerebellar-thalamocortical pathway drives behavioral context-dependent movement initiation Neuron. 2021; 109 :2326-2338.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains to be seen whether DCN can serve a similar role as PPN/MRN in terms of switching modes of cortical activity. PPN/MRN and DCN project to partially overlapping thalamic nuclei. Further investigation is required to test whether PPN/MRN and DCN are redundant, serve as parts of a chain or loop ( Hazrati and Parent, 1992 44. Hazrati, L.N. ∙ Parent, A.

This study is based on both male and female mice (age > P60, except for acute slice recording). We used eight mouse lines: C57Bl/6J (JAX #000664), VGAT-ChR2-EYFP (JAX #14548) ( Zhao et al., 2011 124.

All procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the Janelia Institutional Animal Care, MPFI IACUC committee, and Use Committee or the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee. Detailed information on water restriction, surgical procedures, and behavior have been published ( Guo et al., 2014a 39. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Hires, S.A. ∙ Li, N. ... Procedures for behavioral experiments in head-fixed mice PLoS One. 2014; 9 , e88678 Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar ). Mice were housed in a 12:12 reverse light: dark cycle and behaviorally tested during the dark phase. A typical behavioral session lasted between 1 and 2 hours. Mice obtained all of their water in the behavior apparatus (approximately 1 ml per day; 0.3 ml was supplemented if mice drank less than 0.5 ml). Mice were implanted with a titanium headpost and single housed. For cortical photoinhibition, mice were implanted with a clear skull cap (Guo et al., 2014c). Craniotomies for recording were made after behavioral training.
We followed published protocols ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bctxiwpn ) for virus and tracer injection. See Tables S1 and S2 for detailed descriptions of viruses and injection coordinates. We used the following tracers: WGA-Alexa555 (WGA-Alexa Fluor® 555; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Red RetroBeads (Lumafluor). See Table S3 for a list of viruses used in this research.
For the tactile delayed-response task ( Guo et al., 2014a 39. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Hires, S.A. ∙ Li, N. ... Procedures for behavioral experiments in head-fixed mice PLoS One. 2014; 9 , e88678 Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar ) (all experiments but Figures S3 A–S3D and S7 ), at the beginning of each trial, a metal pole (diameter, 0.9 mm) moved within reach of the whiskers (0.2 s travel time) for 1.0 seconds, after which it was retracted (0.2 s retraction time). The sample epoch (1.4 s total) was the time from the onset of pole movement to the completion of pole retraction. The delay epoch lasted for another 1.2 s after the completion of pole retraction. An auditory ‘Go cue’ (pure tone, 3 or 3.4 kHz, 0.1 s) separated the delay and the response epochs.
A two-spout lickport (4.5 mm between spouts) was used to record licking events and deliver water rewards. After the Go cue, licking the correct lickport produced a water reward (approximately 2 μL); licking the incorrect lickport triggered a timeout (0 to 5 s). Licking before the Go cue (‘early lick’ trials) was punished by a timeout (1 s). Trials in which mice did not lick within 1.5 seconds after the Go cue (‘no response’ trials) were rare and typically occurred at the end of behavioral sessions.
For Figure 5 G, individual mice were trained to respond to a 3 (or 12) kHz (pure tone, 0.1 s) Go cue, but to ignore another pure tone (12 or 3 kHz), played at the time of normal Go cue (different tone trials). Go cue omitted trials (trials without Go cue) and different tone trials were deployed in 25% randomly selected trials. Licking in Go cue omitted trials and different tone trials was punished with a timeout (1 s).
For the auditory delayed-response task ( Figures S3 A–S3D and S7 ), tones were presented at one of two frequencies: 3 or 12 kHz, during the sample epoch. Each tone was played three times for 150 ms with 100 ms inter-tone intervals. The following delay epoch lasted for another 1.2 seconds. An auditory ‘Go cue’ (carrier frequency 6 kHz, with 360 Hz modulating frequency, 0.1 s) separated the delay and the response epochs. For the task with a fake cue ( Figures S7 I–S7K), the Go cue sound was played 0.6s after the onset of the delay epoch. Licks after the fake cue were not rewarded or punished.
Photostimulation was deployed on ∼25% trials selected at random. To prevent mice from distinguishing photostimulation trials from control trials using visual cues, a ‘masking flash’ (1 ms pulses at 10 Hz) was delivered using 470 nm LEDs (Luxeon Star) throughout the trial. For both ChR2 and stGtACR1, we used a 473 nm laser (Laser Quantum). The laser power was controlled by an acousto optical modulator (AOM; Quanta Tech) and a shutter (Vincent Associates). See Table S1 .
The ChR2-assisted photoinihibition of ALM ( Figures 3 D–3F) was performed through clear-skull cap (beam diameter at the skull: 400 μm at 4 σ) (Guo et al., 2014c). We stimulated parvalbumin-positive interneurons in PV-IRES-Cre mice crossed to Ai32 reporter mice expressing ChR2 ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 1.6 s starting at the onset of the delay epoch (T delay ) with 200 ms ramping down (mean laser power: 1.5mW). We silenced ALM ipsilateral to the recorded thalamus.
To silence medulla-projecting ALM neurons (PT lower ) bilaterally ( Figure 2 ), we photoinhibited for 1 s with 100 ms ramping down, starting at the timing of the Go cue. We photoinhibited four spots on each hemisphere, centered on ALM (AP 2.5 mm; ML 1.5 mm) with 1 mm spacing (in total eight spots bilaterally) using scanning Galvo mirrors through clear-skull cap. We photoinhibited each spot sequentially, at the rate of 5 ms per spot. The laser powers noted in the figures and text indicate the mean laser power per spot.
For PPN/MRN Th axonal photostimulation experiments ( Figure 6 ), we randomly interleaved three trial types: (1) Go cue trials, trials with Go cue at T delay + 1.2 s (i.e. 1.2 s after delay onset; this is the control condition mice were trained with, which constitutes 75-85% of trials during the experiments); (2) Go cue omitted trials, trials without Go cue at T delay + 1.2 s; (3) stimulation trials, trials with axonal excitation of Thalamus-projecting PPN/MRN by 20mW 473nm laser at T delay + 1.2 s for 5 or 10 ms (through N.A. 0.37 fiber optics; see Table S1 for coordinates). In both Go cue omitted trials and stimulation trials, a delayed Go cue was presented at T delay + 2.4 s and licks to this Go cue were rewarded in order to maintain behavioral performance.
To prevent mice from associating optogenetic stimulation with water reward (and increasing licks because of this association), we did not provide water reward to stimulation-triggered licks (licks after the stimulation and before the delayed Go cue). Consequently, mice decreased stimulation-triggered licks over trials/sessions, presumably by learning to distinguish stimulation and the actual Go cue ( Figure S6 H).
For PPN/MRN Th perturbations using stGtACR1 ( Figure 7 ), we delivered photostimuli bilaterally to PPN/MRN Th starting at T delay + 0.6 s lasting 1.2 s duration (with 200 ms ramp up and down to minimize axonal excitation, 40Hz sinusoidal modulation; Go cue was presented at T delay + 1.2 s). We tested 0.25, 1, and 10 mW photostimuli. The strongest photostimulus triggered axonal excitation, and was excluded from the analyses ( Li et al., 2019 68. Li, N. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Guo, Z.V. ... Spatiotemporal constraints on optogenetic inactivation in cortical circuits eLife. 2019; 8 , e48622 Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar ).
Guide cannulas (26 Gauge, P1 Technologies) were implanted bilaterally during the head bar surgery. Internal cannulas (33 Gauge, P1 Technologies) projecting 1.5mm beyond the guide cannula tips were inserted just before infusion in mice performing the auditory delayed-response task (after 257 ± 47 trials, mean ± std). Muscimol hydrobromide (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in cortex buffer (NaCl 125 mM, KCl 5 mM, Glucose 10 mM, HEPES 10 mM, CaCl 2 2 mM, MgSO 4 2 mM, pH 7.4). The control solution was cortex buffer without muscimol. In all conditions, 50 nl solution was infused per hemisphere using Hamilton syringes. Behavior was initiated five minutes after the infusion. We focused our analysis on the first 20 trials (154 ± 26 seconds, mean ± std.) after the infusion ( Figures S7 B–S7E) to avoid side effects caused by the lack of licking and diffusion of muscimol. See Table S1 .
All whole-cell recordings were made from the left ALM. Data and detailed procedures have been published ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, we partially compensated for series resistance and injected a ramping current until action potentials disappeared ( Anderson et al., 2000 3. Anderson, J.S. ∙ Carandini, M. ∙ Ferster, D. Orientation tuning of input conductance, excitation, and inhibition in cat primary visual cortex J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84 :909-926 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2016 123.

The principle of this experiment is as following. Neglecting spatial components, the membrane potential of ALM neurons is governed by: 𝐶 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑉 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = − 𝑔 𝐿 ⁡ ( 𝑉 ) ⁢ ( 𝑉 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) − 𝐸 𝐿 ) − 𝑔 𝐸 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⁢ ( 𝑉 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) − 𝐸 𝐸 ) − 𝑔 𝐼 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⁢ ( 𝑉 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) − 𝐸 𝐼 ) + 𝐼 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑗 ⁡ ( 𝑡 )
g L , g E , and g I are conductances related to leak, excitatory, and inhibitory currents, respectively. E L , E E , and E I are the corresponding reversal potentials. g L is a function of membrane potential because of intrinsic voltage-dependent currents.
We assume E L = -50 mV, E E = 0 mV and E I = -70 mV. To selectively expose inhibitory conductances, we depolarized V near 0 mV. The contribution of g E to the membrane potential is reduced because V(t) – E E is near 0. On the other hand, the contributions of g I to the membrane potential become stronger, since V(t) – E I = 70 mV is larger (approximately 3.5 fold) compared to resting conditions (V(t) – E I = 20mV). Increases or decreases in g I result in hyperpolarization or depolarization, respectively. Similarly, for negative current injection experiments, we hyperpolarized V near -70 mV. Under this condition, the contributions of g E to the membrane potential is increased. Increases or decreases in g E result in depolarization or hyperpolarization, respectively.
A small craniotomy (diameter, 0.5 – 1 mm) was made over the recording sites one day prior to the first recording session. Extracellular spikes were recorded using Janelia silicon probes (HH-2) with two shanks (32 channels each, 25 μm interval between channel, 250 μm between shanks), or Neuropixels probes ( Jun et al., 2017b 55.

Neuropixels 2.0: a miniaturized high-density probe for stable, long-term brain recordings Science. 2021; 372 , eabf4588 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the HH-2 probe, 64 channel voltage signals were multiplexed, recorded on a PCI6133 board (National instrument), and digitized at 400 kHz (14 bit). The signals were demultiplexed into 64 voltage traces sampled at 25 kHz and stored for offline analysis. All recordings were made with open-source software SpikeGLX ( http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/ ). During recordings the craniotomy was immersed in cortex buffer. Brain tissue was allowed to settle for at least five minutes before recordings. For ALM, recording depth (between 800 μm to 1100 μm) was inferred from manipulator readings. For subcortical areas, electrode tracks labelled with CM-DiI were used to determine recording locations ( Liu et al., 2020 71. Liu, L.D. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Economo, M.N. ... Accurate localization of linear probe electrodes across multiple brains Preprint at bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 F).
Mice were perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 4% PFA / 0.1 M PB. Brains were post fixed overnight and transferred to 20% sucrose PB before sectioning on a freezing microtome. Coronal 50 μm free-floating sections were processed using standard fluorescent immunohistochemical techniques. All sections were stained with NeuroTrace® 435/455 Blue Fluorescent Nissl Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, N21479). The fluorescent label was amplified with immunohistochemical techniques with rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland Immunochemicals, Pottsdown, PA, 600-401-3790) and goat anti-rabbit 555 secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher Scientific, A27039) or chicken anti-GFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10262) and goat anti-chicken 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11039). Cholinergic neurons were labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody to ChAT (Sigma, AMAb 91130) and goat anti-mouse 647 secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11039). Slide-mounted sections were imaged on a Zeiss microscope with a Ludl motorized stage controlled with Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience). Imaging was done with a 10× objective and a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 camera. The image in Figure 4 F was acquired with a spinning-disk confocal system (Marianas; 3I, Inc.) consisting of a Axio Observer Z1 (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a CSU-W1 spinning-disk head (Yokogawa Corporation of America), ORCA-Flash4.0 v2 sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics), 63x 1.4 NA / Plan-Apochromat / 180μm WD oil objective. Image acquisition was performed using SlideBook 6.0 (3I, Inc).
AAV5-EF1α-DIO-hChR2 (H134R)-mCherry (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) or AAV2/8-EF1α-DIO-hChR2 (H134R)-EYFP (Addgene) was injected in Vglut2-IRES-Cre mice at coordinates from Bregma (in mm); AP -4.7, ML 1.2 and -1.2, DV -3.5 in mice (P21-P28). Mice were used for slice recordings 4-8 weeks after the viral surgery. Animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, perfused transcardially with ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 50 sucrose, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 4 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, and 1.2 NaH2PO4, osmolarity 300–310 mOsm/kg) and subsequently decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed, and 300 μm thick coronal brain slices (Leica VT1000S vibratome, Germany) were prepared in chilled cutting solution, after which the slices were transferred to oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF in mM; 118 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 2.5 KCl 2.5, 1.2 NaHPO4, 1.3 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2). Slices were kept at 33 °C for 30 min and then kept at room temperature for at least 30 minutes prior to recording. For drug application experiments, VM neurons were voltage clamped at -60mV. Tetrodotoxin (TTX 1 μM; Alomone) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP 200 μM; Sigma) were used to eliminate action potential-dependent EPSCs, while augmenting light-induced, direct depolarization of ChR2-positive PPN/MRN terminals, resulting in the selective elimination of polysynaptic events. The non-NMDA iGluR antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX 10 μM; Tocris) was used to block AMPA/ kainate iGluR receptors to confirm that the synaptic PPN/MRN to VM connection is glutamatergic.
Acute brain slices were transferred to the recording chamber of an upright microscope (Olympus BX50WI, Japan) fitted with a CCD camera (Michigan City, IN), LED system (Olympus pE-2 CoolLED, Japan) with YFP/RFP filter sets, and a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA). During the recording of VM neurons, slices were perfused with warmed oxygenated ACSF (32 ± 2 °C). Recording pipettes were pulled to a tip resistance of 4–6 MΩ when filled with an internal solution. The internal solution contained (in mM): 135 KMeSO4, 7 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg2ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, and 0.3% biocytin, pH7.3 adjusted with KOH, osmolarity 280-290 mOsm. In experiments where only voltage-clamp and no current-clamp recordings were made, the internal solution contained (in mM): 135 CsMeSO4, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 7 Na-phosphocreatine, 2 Mg2-ATP, 0.3 Na3-GTP, 10 EGTA, 0.1 spermine, and 0.3% biocytin (pH, 7.3 with CsOH; Osmolarity, 280-290 mOsm). Electrode offset potentials were corrected prior to giga-ohm seal formation. ChR2-expressing axon terminals were light-activated with 5 or 100 ms whole-field LED illumination at blue excitation wavelengths (470 nm) at 1.8 mW (0.09 mW for subthreshold stimulation). Liquid junction potentials were not compensated for. The series resistance was typically between 10–30 MΩ and was monitored during the experiments. For voltage-clamp average responses, neurons were clamped at -60 mV, and at least 10 photostimuli (duration, 5 ms; wavelength, 470 nm) were given at 10second intervals. Light-evoked response amplitudes were measured from baseline to peak. Response latencies were measured from the onset of the photostimulus, and jitter was defined as the standard deviation of the latencies. Data were acquired using AxoGraph X (AxoGraph, Australia), filtered at 10 kHz, and digitized at 20 kHz using an ITC-16 board (InstruTech, USA). Off-line analysis was performed with AxoGraph X.
To calculate the proportion of trials with licks, ‘lick early’ trials were excluded ( Figures 2 C, 7 B, S2 C, and S2D). To calculate the correct rate (i.e., the proportion of licks to the correct direction), ‘lick early’ trials and ‘no response’ trials were excluded ( Figures S2 C and S6 G). ‘Lick’ was defined as a contact of the tongue with the electrical lick ports. This explains the existence of trials with tongue movement (based on high-speed videography) but without ‘lick’ ( Figure 6 D, stim w.o. lick).
For PPN/MRN stimulation experiments ( Figure 6 B) we plotted the proportion of trials with T delay + 1.2 s < T lick < T delay + 1.8 s (T lick denotes the timing of the first lick). Since stimulation was delivered at T delay + 1.2s, this corresponds to a proportion of trials with licks within 0.6 s after the stimulation. An increase in lick during stim trials ( Figures S6 D, S6F, and S6H) is the difference in the proportion of trials with licks between stim trials and the Go cue omitted trials. To calculate the correct rate of stim trials ( Figures 6 C and S6 G, right), we considered the first lick direction within T delay + 1.2 s < T lick < T delay + 1.8s. The control ( Figures 6 C and S6 G, left) is the correct rate of Go cue trials. For statistics, we performed hierarchical bootstrapping: first, we randomly selected animals with replacement, second, randomly selected sessions of each animal with replacement, and third randomly selected trials within each session with replacement.
High-speed (400 Hz) videography of orofacial movement (side view) was acquired using a CMOS camera (acA2040-180km, Basler) with IR illumination (940nm LED, Roithner Laser). We used DeepLabCut ( Mathis et al., 2018 78. Mathis, A. ∙ Mamidanna, P. ∙ Cury, K.M. ... DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of user-defined body parts with deep learning Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :1281-1289 Crossref Scopus (736) PubMed Google Scholar ) to track the movement of the tongue, jaw, and nose ( Figure 1 B; Videos S1 and S2 ). For jaw and nose, movements along dorsoventral direction were analyzed. The amplitude of movement was normalized per session so that the mean position at T delay + 1.2 seconds (time 0 in Figure 6 D) was 0 and the maximum movement in the Go cue trials was 1. Note that the jaw moves downward after the Go cue, but due to this normalization, the value increases in Figure 6 .
To calculate the onset of jaw and nose movements, we performed hierarchical bootstrapping. The mean trace was calculated based on these randomly selected trials. Next, we linearly detrended the mean trace based on its value between T delay + 0.6 s and T delay + 1.2 s (time 0 to -0.6 in Figure 6 D). We identified the time point in which movement exceeds three times the standard deviation of the baseline before the Go cue (100 ms window). We repeated this procedure 1,000 times to estimate the mean and S.E.M.
To calculate the onset of tongue movement, we first calculated the cumulative distribution (c.d.f.) of the first time point when the tongue was detected by DeepLabCut after the Go cue (T delay + 1.2 seconds). We subtracted the c.d.f. of a trial type of interest by the c.d.f. of the Go cue omitted trial ( Figure 6 D, dotted line). Movement onset is the time point at which the difference passes 0.05. We repeated this procedure with hierarchical bootstrapping 1,000 times to estimate the mean and S.E.M.
Following these methods, tongue detection onset in Figure 6 D: (Go cue) 64.3 (56.0–75.0) ms; mean (2.5-97.5% confidence interval); (stim followed by lick) 75.5 (50.0-118.0) ms; p = 0.194 (hierarchical bootstrap). Jaw movement onse in Fig6Dt: (Go cue) 33.2 (20.0-42.5) ms; (stim followed by lick) 69.7 (8.8-102.5) ms; p = 0.114 (hierarchical bootstrap). Nose movement onset in Figure 6 D: (Go cue) 43.0 (32.5-50.0) ms; (stim followed by lick) 61.9 (7.5-117.1) ms; p = 0.139 (hierarchical bootstrap). The null hypothesis for p-value is that the onset of Go cue trials is shorter than that in stim trials.
JRClust ( Jun et al., 2017a 54. Jun, J.J. ∙ Mitelut, C. ∙ Lai, C. ... Real-time spike sorting platform for high-density extracellular probes with ground-truth validation and drift correction Preprint at bioRxiv. 2017; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) ( https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/JRCLUST ) with manual curation (all data except Figures S3 A–S3D) or Kilosort2 ( https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort2 ) were used for spike sorting. For Kilosort2, we used a combination of quality metrics ( https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ecephys_spike_sorting ) to extract potential good units for analysis: amplitude > 100 μV, ISI violation < 0.5, amplitude cutoff < 0.1, SNR > 2.5, spike width < 1.2 ms, and a presence ratio > 0.95 over the course of recording sessions.
During the tactile delayed-response task, we recorded 9472 neurons across 300 behavioral sessions from 53 mice. For ALM, in total, 6030 neurons were recorded across 173 behavioral sessions from 37 mice. For thalamus, in total, 640 neurons were recorded across 23 behavioral sessions from 4 mice. For midbrain, 2808 neurons were recorded across 102 sessions from 18 mice. In addition, we analyzed published data collected from mice trained in the same tactile delayed-response task: 611 thalamus neurons and 116 SNr neurons from Guo et al. (2017) 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar , and 554 DCN neurons from Gao et al. (2018) 32. Gao, Z. ∙ Davis, C. ∙ Thomas, A.M. ... A cortico-cerebellar loop for motor planning Nature. 2018; 563 :113-116 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar . Spike widths were computed as the trough-to-peak interval of the mean spike waveform. In ALM, putative pyramidal neurons (units with spike width > 0.5 ms) were analyzed (Guo et al., 2014c). In thalamus and SNr, units with width > 0.35ms and < 0.35ms, respectively, were analyzed following the criteria in Guo et al. (2017) 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar .
In the auditory delayed-response task ( Figures S3 A–S3D), we obtained 13139 units across 76 sessions from 15 animals. We analyzed 5072, 655, 607, 1145, and 1560 units in ALM, M1, thal ALM , SC, and PPN/MRN, respectively.
For Figures 1 , 3 , and 5 , neurons with at least 40 correct lick right trials and 40 correct lick left trials were analyzed. Forty trials were randomly subsampled for each correct trial type (lick right and left) to analyze latency and selectivity. To calculate the latency from the Go cue for each neuron, we assumed that spike generation follows a Poisson process. First, we calculated the baseline spike rate before T go (time of the Go cue; 100 ms window to calculate the baseline). Second, we identified the first time point after T go in which the spike rate becomes higher or lower than a significance level, ⍺ = 0.001 (Poisson distribution based on the baseline spike rate; we call this time point as T p = 0.001 ). We defined the latency as the last time-point in which the spike rate becomes higher or lower than a second significance level, ⍺ = 0.05 (Poisson distribution) between (T go , T p =0.001 ]. We took this two steps approach to avoid detecting small amplitude changes.
Delay- and response- selective cells ( Figure S5 C) are neurons with significant delay or response selectivity ( ranksum test comparing spike counts in correct lick right vs. correct lick left trials during (T go – 0.6s, T go ), and (T go , T go + 0.6s), respectively; Forty trials were randomly subsampled for each correct trial type; p < 0.05.)
For the peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) in Figures 1 C, 5 B, and S1 A, only correct trials were included. In Figures 2 F, S2 E, S6 I, S8 D, and S8 E, correct, incorrect, and no-lick trials were pooled to compare control vs. perturbation conditions. PSTHs were smoothed with a 100 ms boxcar filter for plots including all epochs (e.g., Figure 1 B) or with a 5 ms causal boxcar filter for plots zoomed in around the Go cue (e.g., Figure 5 B). In Figures 3 A, 5 C, 7 C, and S5 A, spike rates were z-scored.
To plot the density of neurons in Figures 3 C and 5 A, we applied a 2D Gaussian filter (half-width = 250 μm) to the estimated location of each neuron. For each pixel we calculated the density as (number of neurons with short latency or delay selectivity) / (number of neurons + 0.05). The 0.05 was added to the denominator to prevent pixels with low numbers of neurons from having an extremely high estimated density.
To calculate delay coding direction (CD delay ) for a population of n recorded neurons, we looked for an n × 1 unit vector that maximally distinguished the two trial types in the n-dimensional activity space. For each time point t , we defined a population selectivity vector: wt = r lick-right, t − r lick-left, t, where r lick-right, t and r lick-left, t are n × 1 vectors of spike rate of individual neurons averaged across correct lick right and left trials without optogenetic manipulations (unperturbed correct trials) respectively. CD delay is wt averaged over the last 600 ms of the delay epoch (T go - 0.6 s < t < T go ) and normalized it by its norm. The coding direction after the Go cue (CD response ) was calculated similarly over the first 400 ms of the response epoch (T go < t < T go + 0.4 s). We then orthogonalized CD response to CD delay using the Gram-Schmidt process. To calculate the go direction ( D go ), we subtracted ( r lick-right, t + r lick-left, t )/2 after the Go cue (T go < t < T go + 0.1 s) from that before the Go cue (T go - 0.1 s < t < T go ), followed by normalization. The ramping direction ( D ramp ; Figure S1 I) was defined as a vector maximally distinguishing the mean activity before the trial onset (0.6 s window) and the mean activity before the Go cue (0.1 s window). All directions were orthogonalized to each other using the Gram-Schmidt process in Figures 1 F and S1 I. The stimulation direction ( D stim ; Figures S6 E and S6F) was defined as a vector maximally distinguishing control (Go cue omitted) and stimulation trials after the stimulation (T go < t < T go + 0.1 s).
In each recording session we randomly selected 50 % of unperturbed correct trials to calculate directions in individual recording sessions ( Figures 2 , 6 , 7 , S1 H, S1J–S1L, S2 , S6 , S7 , and S8 ). We then projected the spike rate in the remaining trials to the calculated directions to obtain trajectories. To pool trajectories across sessions, we normalized projections in each session based on the mean trajectories of the unperturbed correct trials. The projection to CD delay was normalized by the mean activity before the Go cue (T go - 0.1 s < t < T go ) so that activity in the lick left trials becomes 0 and in lick right trials 1. The projection to CD response in each session was normalized by the mean activity after the Go cue (T go < t < T go + 0.4 s) so that activity in lick left trials becomes 0 and in lick right trials 1. D go in each session was normalized by the mean activity around the Go cue (mean activity difference before and after the Go cue, 100 ms window, to be 1). The plots ( Figures 2 , 6 , 7 , S1 , S2 , S6 , S7 , and S8 ) show grand medians. Hierarchical bootstrapping was used to estimate S.E.M. Neurons with low spike rates (less than 2 spikes per s) were excluded from analysis. Sessions with less than five cells or without significant selectivity before the Go cue (100 ms window, p > 0.05, ranksum test) were excluded from session-based analysis because directions could not be well defined (34/129 sessions). In Figures 6 E and S6 L–S6P, sessions with stimulation-triggered licks were analyzed (21 sessions).
In Figure 5 we performed latency analysis across sessions and we thus calculated directions by subsampling cells recorded across sessions (i.e., projection is not based on simultaneous recordings) ( Figures 1 and S1 I were performed similarly for consistency). For each cell, we subsampled 20 unperturbed correct lick right and left trials each to define directions. Then, we projected the spike rate in the other 20 trials to these directions as an inner product to obtain trajectories. We excluded cells with less than 40 correct trials per lick direction. To calculate the “selectivity explained” ( Figure 1 F), we first calculated the total selectivity as the squared sum of selectivity across neurons (squared sum of n × 1 vector). We then calculated the squared sum of selectivity of the projection along each mode at each time point. To calculate the “activity explained” ( Figure S1 I), we calculated the squared sum of the spike rate after subtracting the baseline (mean spike rate before the sample onset; 0.6 s window) across neurons. Similarly, we calculated the squared sum of the activity along each direction after subtracting the baseline. In Figures 1 G, 5 E, and 5F, the mean of correct lick right and left trials is shown for D go , and the difference between correct lick right and left trials is shown for CD delay and CD response . Projections are boxcar filtered (causal, 10 ms window). In Figures 5 E and 5F, projections are standardized by the activity before the Go cue (T go - 0.1 s < t < T go ). To calculate the latency to the Go cue ( Figures 1 G, 5 E, and 5F), we first identified the first time point in which the projection passes five times of the standard deviation after the Go cue (T std = 5 ). We then defined the latency as the last time point in which the projection passes two times of the standard deviation between (T go , T std=5 ). We subsampled 1,000 cells with replacement in Figures 1 E–1G and S1 I. In Figure 5 , to match the data size across brain areas, we randomly subsampled 226 cells with replacement to calculate the direction and projection (except for SNr and NLL, where we had 116 and 23 cells, respectively; in these areas, we randomly sampled 116 and 23 cells with replacement). We repeated this subsampling 1,000 times.
Each coronal section was made up of 80–200 image tiles merged with Neurolucida software. The whole-brain image stack was registered to the Allen Institute Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) ( Wang et al., 2020 119. Wang, Q. ∙ Ding, S.-L. ∙ Li, Y. ... The Allen Mouse Brain Common coordinate framework: a 3D reference atlas Cell. 2020; 181 :936-953.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ) of the mouse brain using NeuroInfo software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) or using a Matlab-based script (Mike Economo, Boston University). For cell counting ( Figure S4 ), neurons labeled with AAV retro were detected with a Laplacian of Gaussian algorithm using NeuroInfo software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Tips of the probe tracks were annotated manually and transformed into the Allen CCF to estimate recording sites ( Figure S3 F). In Figures 4 A and S4 D, pixel intensities are normalized: (signal in each pixel – mean signal in cortical areas)/ (99.5 percentile signal in the image – mean signal in cortical areas); since these subcortical areas do not project to the cortex, the cortical signal was used as a baseline for normalization. In Figure 4 B, the mean normalized pixel intensities were averaged per nucleus in thal ALM .
To define thal ALM , we injected WGA-Alexa555 in ALM ( Guo et al., 2017 40. Guo, Z.V. ∙ Inagaki, H.K. ∙ Daie, K. ... Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop Nature. 2017; 545 :181-186 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). After registering to the Allen CCF, 10 μm voxels with retrogradely labeled cells (n = 3 mice) were defined as thal ALM .
For fluorescent in situ hybridization ( Figures S4 G and S4H) we used hybridization chain reaction (HCR; Molecular Instruments) ( Choi et al., 2018 9. Choi, H.M.T. ∙ Schwarzkopf, M. ∙ Fornace, M.E. ... Third-generation in situ hybridization chain reaction: multiplexed, quantitative, sensitive, versatile, robust Development. 2018; 145 :dev165753 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ) on 150 μm thick coronal sections, following the protocol described in Nicovich et al. (2019) 82. Nicovich, P.R. ∙ Taormina, M.J. ∙ Baker, C.A. ... Multimodal cell type correspondence by intersectional mFISH in intact tissues. Preprint at bioRxiv 2019 Crossref Google Scholar . We probed for Chat (H1), Gad1 (H2) and, Slc17a6 ( VGglut2 ; H3) with amplifiers conjugated with Alexa546 (for H1), Alexa647 (for H2), and Alexa594 (for H3) (See Table S4 for probe sequences). Images were acquired with an LSM880 confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a Plan-Apochromat 40x N.A. 1.3 Oil objective.
The sample sizes are similar to the sample sizes used in the field. No statistical methods were used to determine sample size. During experiments, trial types were randomly determined by a computer program. During spike sorting, experimenters cannot tell the trial type and therefore were blind to conditions. All comparisons using signed rank and ranksum tests were two-sided. All bootstrapping was done over 1,000 iterations.
