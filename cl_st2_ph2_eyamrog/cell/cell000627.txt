Title: Humoral and cellular immune memory to four COVID-19 vaccines


Abstract: Summary

Multiple COVID-19 vaccines, representing diverse vaccine platforms, successfully protect against symptomatic COVID-19 cases and deaths. Head-to-head comparisons of T cell, B cell, and antibody responses to diverse vaccines in humans are likely to be informative for understanding protective immunity against COVID-19, with particular interest in immune memory. Here, SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific immune responses to Moderna mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S, and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 were examined longitudinally for 6 months 100% of individuals made memory CD4 + T cells, with cTfh and CD4-CTL highly represented after mRNA or NVX-CoV2373 vaccination. mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S induced comparable CD8 + T cell frequencies, though only detectable in 60–67% of subjects at 6 months. A differentiating feature of Ad26.COV2.S immunization was a high frequency of CXCR3 + memory B cells. mRNA vaccinees had substantial declines in antibodies, while memory T and B cells were comparatively stable. These results may also be relevant for insights against other pathogens.

Section: Introduction

The response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has relied in large part on the development, testing, and deployments of vaccines. In a short time, several different vaccine platforms have been developed and, after establishing their safety and efficacy, deployed for use in a large number of individuals. In the USA, two different mRNA vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 [ Jackson et al., 2020 22. Jackson, L.A. ∙ Anderson, E.J. ∙ Rouphael, N.G. ... An mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 - Preliminary report N.

The recombinant protein-based adjuvanted vaccine Novavax NVX-CoV2373 completed successful Phase 3 efficacy clinical trials in the USA, Mexico, and the UK ( Dunkle et al., 2021 13. Dunkle, L.M. ∙ Kotloff, K.L. ∙ Gay, C.L. ... Efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in Adults in the United States and Mexico N. Engl. J.

Novavax Coronavirus Vaccine Candidate Updates 2022 Google Scholar ). These four vaccines are representatives of the three main vaccine platforms in use for the prevention of COVID-19, namely mRNA, viral vector, and recombinant protein plus adjuvant ( Pollard and Bijker, 2021 49. Pollard, A.J. ∙ Bijker, E.M. A guide to vaccinology: from basic principles to new developments Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21 :83-100 Crossref Scopus (679) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In Phase 3 trials, these vaccines proved remarkably effective with early vaccine efficacy (VE) of 95% for BNT162b2 ( Thomas et al., 2021 64. Thomas, S.J. ∙ Moreira, Jr., E.D. ∙ Kitchin, N. ...

Med. 2021; 385 :1761-1773 Crossref Scopus (894) PubMed Google Scholar ), 94% for mRNA-1273 ( Baden et al., 2021 2. Baden, L.R. ∙ El Sahly, H.M. ∙ Essink, B. ... Efficacy and safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384 :403-416 Crossref Scopus (6714) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 90% for NVX-CoV2373 ( Dunkle et al., 2021 13.

Med. 2021; 385 :1172-1183 Crossref Scopus (664) PubMed Google Scholar ) against COVID-19 cases. A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S was associated with 67% VE overall and 70% in the USA ( Sadoff et al., 2021 55. Sadoff, J. ∙ Gray, G. ∙ Vandebosch, A. ... Safety and efficacy of single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine against Covid-19 N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384 :2187-2201 Crossref Scopus (1627) PubMed Google Scholar ). 6-month efficacy data for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were 91 and 93% against COVID-19 cases ( Thomas et al., 2021 64.

Med. 2021; 385 :1761-1773 Crossref Scopus (894) PubMed Google Scholar ). Population-based "real world" studies of COVID-19 VE have provided additional insights, including comparisons between vaccines. VE wanes against symptomatic COVID-19 over time ( Leon et al., 2022 31.

In one large study, VE against symptomatic COVID-19 for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 decreased to 67 and 75% at 5–7 months ( Rosenberg et al., 2022 52. Rosenberg, E.S. ∙ Dorabawila, V. ∙ Easton, D. ... Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness in New York state N. Engl. J. Med. 2022; 386 :116-127 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). 1-dose Ad26.COV2.S VE started lower and also declined ( Rosenberg et al., 2022 52.

Comparable findings were made in multiple studies of populations using BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S ( Leon et al., 2022 31. Leon, T.M. ∙ Dorabawila, V. ∙ Nelson, L. ...

If any detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered, as opposed to symptomatic disease, lower VE is observed for all vaccines ( Nordstrom et al., 2022 42. Nordstrom, P. ∙ Ballin, M. ∙ Nordstrom, A. Risk of infection, hospitalisation, and death up to 9 months after a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine: a retrospective, total population cohort study in Sweden Lancet. 2022; 399 :814-823 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pouwels et al., 2021 50.

Med. 2021; 27 :2127-2135 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Higher VE against hospitalization is observed for all COVID-19 vaccines, with somewhat lower hospitalization VE for Ad26.COV2.S compared to the mRNA vaccines (e.g. 82 vs. 94% [ Rosenberg et al., 2022 52. Rosenberg, E.S. ∙ Dorabawila, V. ∙ Easton, D. ... Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness in New York state N. Engl. J. Med. 2022; 386 :116-127 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ]). Notably, in multiple large "real world" studies, VE against hospitalization was stable over time in contrast to VE against infections ( Tartof et al., 2021 63. Tartof, S.Y. ∙ Slezak, J.M. ∙ Fischer, H. ... Effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine up to 6 months in a large integrated health system in the USA: a retrospective cohort study Lancet. 2021; 398 :1407-1416 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ), potentially indicating distinct immunological mechanisms of action contributing to protection against hospitalization compared to detectable infection ( Sette and Crotty, 2021 59. Sette, A. ∙ Crotty, S. Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Cell. 2021; 184 :861-880 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1124) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Antibodies have been established as a clear correlate of protection against infection over the first months post-vaccination ( Gilbert et al., 2022 17. Gilbert, P.B. ∙ Montefiori, D.C. ∙ McDermott, A.B. ... Immune correlates analysis of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy clinical trial Science. 2022; 375 :43-50 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khoury et al., 2021 27. Khoury, D.S. ∙ Cromer, D. ∙ Reynaldi, A. ... Neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of immune protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1205-1211 Crossref Scopus (2459) PubMed Google Scholar ), but several lines of evidence also suggest important contributions from T and B cell memory responses in protective immunity ( Sette and Crotty, 2021 59. Sette, A. ∙ Crotty, S. Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Cell. 2021; 184 :861-880 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1124) PubMed Google Scholar ), with neutralizing antibodies playing a dominant role in prevention of infection, while cellular immunity might be key to modulate disease severity and resolve infection ( Kedzierska, 2022 23. Kedzierska, K. Count on us: T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination Cell Rep Med. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, available data suggest that coordinated functions of different branches of adaptive immunity may provide multiple mechanisms of protective immunity against COVID-19.
Differences between VE of COVID-19 vaccines suggest that the different vaccines might generate differential immune memory. Comparisons of immunogenicity and immune memory of different COVID-19 vaccines have been limited, hampered by multiple challenges. First, side-by-side comparisons with standardized cellular assays are often lacking. Standardized binding antibody and neutralizing antibody quantitation is possible via the use of WHO international standards ( Mattiuzzo, 2020 37. Mattiuzzo, G. Establishment of the WHO International Standard and Reference Panel for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody 2020 Google Scholar ). However, CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, and memory B cell assays all use live cells and complex reagents, which are far less amenable to cross-laboratory comparisons, and thus memory T and B cell measurements within the same study are required for quantitative comparisons. This is highlighted by the initial discordant findings regarding CD8 + T cell responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, with early reports suggesting quite different CD8 + T cell response rates to BNT162b2 compared to mRNA-1273 ( Corbett et al., 2020 8. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Flynn, B. ∙ Foulds, K.E. ... Evaluation of the mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Nonhuman Primates N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :1544-1555 Crossref Scopus (774) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jackson et al., 2020 22. Jackson, L.A. ∙ Anderson, E.J. ∙ Rouphael, N.G. ... An mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 - Preliminary report N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :1920-1931 Crossref Scopus (2300) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sahin et al., 2021 56. Sahin, U. ∙ Muik, A. ∙ Vogler, I. ... BNT162b2 vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies and poly-specific T cells in humans Nature. 2021; 595 :572-577 Crossref Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, longitudinal studies with cryopreserved PBMCs are needed to directly determine kinetics of vaccine-specific immune memory in humans. Additionally, few studies have assessed antibody, CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, and memory B cell vaccine responses simultaneously in the same individuals.
The massive COVID-19 immunization campaigns represent a unique opportunity to comprehensively collect and analyze immune responses in a longitudinal fashion for individuals immunized in the same year and having no prior immunity. The present study was designed to establish the magnitude and duration of vaccine-induced immune memory with four different vaccine platforms. A direct, side-by-side, comprehensive evaluation of effector and memory immune responses induced by different vaccine platforms is important to advance our understanding of the protection afforded by the various COVID-19 vaccines, as well as understand fundamental differences in immunogenicity and immune memory to mRNA, adenoviral vector, and recombinant protein vaccine platforms in humans. Here, we compare the immune responses induced by three different vaccine platforms, namely two different mRNA vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 and Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2), a viral vector-based vaccine (Janssen Ad26.COV2.S) and the protein-based adjuvanted vaccine Novavax NVX-CoV2373. The inclusion of NVX-CoV2373 was of particular interest for head-to-head comparisons of immune memory between a more conventional recombinant protein vaccine and mRNA and viral vectors. We additionally compared their immune memory to natural infection for binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, spike-specific CD4 + T cells, spike-specific CD8 + T cells, and spike- and RBD-specific memory B cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive side-by-side evaluation of the kinetics of immune memory to these four different vaccine platforms.

Section: Results

To compare the development of immune memory, we enrolled subjects who were either planning or had received immunization with mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, or NVX-CoV2373 vaccine. Characteristics of the donor cohorts are shown in Figure 1 A. All four vaccine groups were similar in their distribution of gender, age, and race or ethnicity. Blood donations were obtained at multiple time points, and both plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were preserved. For example, sampling time points for mRNA-1273 were pre-vaccination (T1), and then four sampling time points after immunization (T2 to T5), counting days after the first immunization: T2 at 15 ± 4 days, T3 at 45 ± 6 days, T4 at 3.5 months (105 ± 6 days), and T5 at 6 months (185 ± 9 days) ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Both cohorts of mRNA vaccinees (mRNA-1273, BNT162b2) received two doses of vaccine, approximately 28 and 21 days apart, respectively. Ad26.COV2.S was authorized as a 1-dose vaccine and thus blood donation timepoints were based on the initial immunization date. For NVX-CoV2373, volunteers were recruited locally who had participated in an NVX-CoV2373 efficacy trial of two intramuscular 5 μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 plus adjuvant 21 days apart ( Dunkle et al., 2021 13. Dunkle, L.M. ∙ Kotloff, K.L. ∙ Gay, C.L. ... Efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in Adults in the United States and Mexico N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). The NVX-CoV2373 trial was structured such that donors initially received two doses of placebo or vaccine in a blinded manner and were then provided two doses of the opposite (vaccine or placebo), such that all participants were vaccinated ( Clinicaltrials.gov, 2022 6. Clinicaltrials.gov, (2022). A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Immune Response, and Safety of a COVID-19 Vaccine in Adults ≥ 18 Years with a Pediatric Expansion in Adolescents (12 to < 18 Years) at Risk for SARS-CoV-2. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04611802 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B). To measure possible exposure to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, IgG levels against the Nucleocapsid (N) protein were measured in each vaccinee ( Figure S1 A. See method details for exclusion criteria).
For all donors at all available time points, SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies ( Figure 2 A), receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies ( Figure 2 B), N antibodies ( Figure S1 A), and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) neutralization titers ( Figure 2 C) were determined, for a total of 1,408 measurements from 352 samples. Binding antibody titers and PSV neutralization titers were quantified based on a WHO standard.
For mRNA-1273, after first dose immunization, 100% of vaccinees had detectable spike IgG and RBD IgG titers ( Figures 2 A and 2B). 86% of vaccinees had detectable neutralizing antibody titers after the first dose ( Figure 2 C). These early findings are consistent with a large mRNA-1273 clinical trial cohort that measured serology at early time points (100% positive for RBD IgG and spike IgG, 82% positive for neutralizing antibody ( Gilbert et al., 2022 17. Gilbert, P.B. ∙ Montefiori, D.C. ∙ McDermott, A.B. ... Immune correlates analysis of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy clinical trial Science. 2022; 375 :43-50 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the second immunization, antibody levels of both spike and RBD IgG were boosted 9-fold ( Figures 2 A and 2B) and neutralizing antibody titers were boosted 25-fold (GMT 1,399) ( Figure 2 C). 100% of mRNA-1273 recipients remained positive for spike IgG, RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibodies at 6-month post-vaccination (T5). From peak (T3) to 6-month (T5), GMTs of spike IgG decreased 6-fold, RBD IgG decreased 9-fold, and neutralizing antibodies decreased 7-fold.
For BNT162b2, after first dose immunization, 100% of vaccinees had detectable Spike IgG and RBD IgG titers ( Figures 2 A and 2B). 76% of vaccinees had detectable neutralizing antibodies after the first dose, which was slightly lower than the 86% with mRNA-1273 ( Figure 2 C). After the second immunization, spike and RBD IgG were boosted nine- to 16-fold ( Figures 2 A and 2B), and neutralizing antibody titers were boosted 20-fold (GMT 903) ( Figure 2 C). 100% of BNT162b2 recipients remained positive for spike IgG, RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibodies at 6-month post-immunization ( Figures 2 A–2C). From peak (T3) to 6-month (T5), GMT of spike IgG, RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody titers decreased by 6-fold, 9-fold, and 6-fold, respectively. These antibody declines after BNT162b2 immunization were comparable with declines after mRNA-1273 immunization ( Figures 2 A–2C). Neutralizing antibody titers in BNT162b2 recipients were lower than mRNA-1273 recipients by 1.6-fold (p = 0.059), 2.2-fold (p = 0.0014), and 1.5-fold (p = 0.13), at the T3, T4, and T5 time points, respectively. Neutralizing antibody titers trended lower in BNT162b2 than mRNA-1273 recipients when assessed in aggregate across the entire 6-month time period (area under curve [AUC], p = 0.051, Figures S1 B-D).
For Ad26.COV2.S 1-dose immunization, 86% of vaccinees had detectable Spike IgG and 79% RBD IgG at T2 ( Figures 2 A and 2B). 64% of vaccinees had detectable neutralizing antibodies at T2, which was somewhat lower than the 86% with mRNA-1273 and 76% with BNT162b2 ( Figure 2 C). Ad26.COV2.S antibody binding and neutralization titers gradually increased over time, with 100% of recipients having detectable Spike IgG, RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibodies at 6-month post-immunization. Ad26.COV2.S neutralizing antibody titers peaked at T5 (GMT 58), but that peak was still 24-fold lower than the mRNA-1273 peak (GMT 1,399) and 16-fold lower than the BNT162b2 peak (GMT 903). At 6-month post-immunization, Ad26.COV2.S neutralizing antibody titers were 3.6-fold lower than mRNA-1273 and 2.4-fold lower than BNT162b2 ( Figure 2 C). Over the entire 6-month time period, Ad26.COV2.S spike IgG, RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody titers were significantly lower than mRNA vaccine recipients (p < 0.0001 mRNA-1273, p < 0.0001 BNT162b2. Figures S1 B–S1D).
For NVX-CoV2373, antibody titers were available for 3.5 and 6 months. Spike and RBD IgG titers were substantial at 3.5 months post-vaccination and were marginally (not significantly) decreased at T5 ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Neutralizing antibody titers were comparable at both timepoints ( Figure 2 C). At 6-month post-immunization, NVX-CoV2373 neutralizing antibody titers (GMT 152) were 2.6-fold higher than Ad26.COV2.S (GMT 58), and were comparable to mRNA-1273 (GMT 209) and BNT162b2 (GMT 140). Considering the 3.5-month to 6-month period in aggregate, RBD IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in NVX-CoV2373 recipients were comparable to both mRNA vaccines ( Figures S1 F-G). Spike IgG decay rates at the final time point were comparable for NVX-CoV2373, mRNA-1273, and BNT162b2 ( t 1/2 were 52, 68, and 69 days respectively. 95% Cls: 37–88, 59–81, and 60–82 days).
Lastly, antibody titers at 6 months were compared to SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects ( Figures 2 D–2F) who were enrolled for a previously reported study ( Mateus et al., 2021 35. Mateus, J. ∙ Dan, J.M. ∙ Zhang, Z. ... Low-dose mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine generates durable memory enhanced by cross-reactive T cells Science. 2021; 374 :eabj9853 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). The previously infected individuals were selected randomly. Recipients of the mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2) had 4.5-fold higher spike IgG ( Figures 2 D), 6.4-fold higher RBD IgG ( Figure 2 E), and 3.4-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers ( Figure 2 F) compared to previously infected subjects. Antibody titers from NVX-CoV2373 recipients also trended higher than SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects ( Figures 2 D–2F). Antibody titers from Ad26.COV2.S were similar to titers from SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects ( Figures 2 D–2F).
Overall, antibody titers were significantly higher for mRNA recipients than Ad26.COV2.S recipients. Recipients of NVX-Co2373 immunization also had higher peak antibody titers than recipients of Ad26.COV2.S. Antibody titers to mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2.S changed substantially over the 6+ months of observation, with different patterns seen for the mRNA versus adenoviral vector platforms.
SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4 + T cell responses were measured for all donors at all available timepoints utilizing two previously described flow cytometry activation-induced marker (AIM) assays (OX40 + CD137 + and OX40 + surface CD40L + [sCD40L]) ( Figure 3 A, 3B, and S2 ) and separate intracellular staining (ICS) for cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2), granzyme B (GzB), and intracellular CD40L (iCD40L) ( Figure 4 ). SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific circulating follicular helper T (cTfh) cells were measured at all time points ( Figures 3 C and S2 D), as this subpopulation of CD4 + T cells is crucial for supporting antibody responses following vaccination ( Crotty, 2019 9.

In response to a single dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (T2), a majority of subjects developed a spike-specific CD4 + T cell response as measured by both AIM + ( Figures 3 A-B) and iCD40L + secreted-effector + (ICS + ) CD4 + T cells ( Figure 4 A and 4B). Spike-specific CD4 + T cell responses peaked after the second mRNA-1273 vaccination (100% responders, T3) and were well maintained out to 6 months post-vaccination, with only a 1.1- to 1.9-fold reduction in AIM + or ICS + CD4 + T cells, respectively ( Figures 3 A, 3B, 4 A and 4B). mRNA-1273 vaccination induced spike-specific cTfh cells in most donors after the first dose, which peaked after the second dose (97%, T3), and memory cTfh cells were maintained out to 6 months post-vaccination with only a 1.8-fold change from peak (T3 to T5, Figure 3 C). Memory cTfh cells represented 27% of the spike-specific memory CD4 + T cells, on average.
Vaccination with BNT162b2 induced spike-specific AIM + and ICS + CD4 + T cells after the first vaccination (T2), with peak responses after the second immunization (T3). However, peak responses to BNT162b2 vaccination were significantly lower than mRNA-1273 peak vaccine responses both by AIM and ICS (1.5-fold lower, p = 0.023; and 2.5-fold lower, p = 0.0075. Figures 3 A and 4 ). Memory CD4 + T cells were detectable in 86–100% of BNT162b2 vaccinees at 6 months after immunization, but the memory CD4 + T cell frequencies were significantly lower than for mRNA-1273 (1.8-fold lower by AIM, p = 0.014 and 2.6-fold lower by ICS, p = 0.0148. Figures 3 A and 4 ). Spike-specific memory cTfh cell frequencies were comparable between BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccination ( Figure 3 C).
Both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccination induced ICS + spike-specific memory CD4 + T cells, including iCD40L + IFNγ + , iCD40L + TNFα + , and iCD40L + IL-2 + cells, detectable out to 6 months post-vaccination. mRNA-1273 vaccinees had significantly higher frequencies of TNFα + and IL-2 + CD4 + T cells at all timepoints and higher levels of IFNγ + memory CD4 + T cells at 6 months relative to BNT162b2 vaccinees ( Figure 4 ). GzB + CD4 + T cells (iCD40L + GzB + ) were assessed as indicators of CD4 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTL). Interestingly, both mRNA vaccines generated GzB + CD4 + T cells as a significant fraction of the overall spike-specific CD4 + T cell response ( Figures 4 G and 4S3). Multifunctional spike-specific CD4 + T cells were observed after the first dose of either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2, and multifunctionality was stably maintained out to 6 months ( Figures 4 B and 4S3).
For the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, spike-specific CD4 + T cell responses were detectable in a majority of individuals and were largely stable out to 6 months post-vaccination (71–100% of individuals with spike-specific CD4 + T cells by AIM assays; 43% with spike-specific CD4 + T cells by ICS ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and 4 ). cTfh cells were detectable in the majority of individuals ( Figure 3 C). Peak CD4 + T cell responses were lower to Ad26.COV2.S than either of the mRNA vaccines. Peak AIM + CD4 + T cells to Ad26.COV2.S were 2.2- to 2.4-fold lower than BNT162b2 and 3.4- to 3.2-fold lower than mRNA-1273 peak responses ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Peak spike-specific ICS + CD4 + T cell responses to Ad26.COV2.S were 6.1-fold lower than BNT162b2 and 15-fold lower than mRNA-1273 ( Figure 4 B). Both mRNA vaccines generated significantly higher peak frequencies of IFNγ + CD4 + T cells than Ad26.COV2.S vaccination (iCD40L + IFNγ + , mRNA1273 p < 0.0001, BNT162b2 p = 0.007), and mRNA-1273 vaccinees had significantly higher IFNγ + spike-specific memory CD4 + T cells than Ad26.COV2.S at 6 months post-vaccination (p = 0.0009, Figure 4 D). The mRNA vaccines also induced significantly more CD4-CTLs at peak than Ad26.COV2.S (mRNA1273 p < 0.0001, BNT162b2 p = 0.0012, Figure 4 G), and the CD4-CTLs induced by the mRNA vaccines were more sustained as memory cells at the 6-month memory timepoint relative to Ad26.COV2.S ( Figure 4 G). Spike-specific CD4 + T cells induced by Ad26.COV2.S had less multifunctionality at all time points relative to both mRNA vaccines (>3 functions, T3 p = 0.023, T4 p = 0.017, T5 p = 0.023; Figures 4 B and S3 A). Overall, memory CD4 + T cell frequencies were lower after Ad26.COV2.S immunization compared to mRNA vaccines, assessed as total spike-specific memory (AIM + ), cTfh memory, IFNγ + memory, CD4-CTL memory, or memory CD4 + T cell multifunctionality.
For the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine, 100% of immunized individuals developed spike-specific memory CD4 + T cells detected by both AIM and ICS assays ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and 4 ). All NVX-CoV2373 immunized individuals had spike-specific memory cTfh cells ( Figure 3 C). Memory CD4 + T cell responses to NVX-CoV2373 were comparable in magnitude to the mRNA vaccines by AIM ( Figures 3 A and 3B). At 6 months post-vaccination, AIM + memory CD4 + T cell frequencies appear to have stabilized, with no discernible half-life for all four vaccines. By ICS, NVX-CoV2373 responses 6 months post-vaccination were comparable to BNT162b2 (NVX-CoV2373 geomean 0.074%, BNT162b2 geomean 0.059%), and significantly higher than the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S geomean 0.015%, p = 0.0057. Figure 4 B). NVX-CoV2373 induced multifunctional memory spike-specific CD4 + T cells comparably to both mRNA vaccines (T4 and T5, Figures 4 B and S3 A), with a shift in the relative abundance of IL-2 + cells over IFNγ + memory CD4 + T cells observed for NVX-CoV2373 ( Figures 4 D and 4F).
Spike-specific CD4 + T cell responses in COVID-19 recovered individuals were assessed to compare infection-induced versus vaccine-elicited T cell memory ( Figures 3 D–3F and 4C). Spike-specific CD4 + T cell memory at 6 months post-vaccination in mRNA-1273 and NVX-CoV2373 vaccinees was significantly higher than for COVID-19 recovered individuals, both by AIM and ICS ( Figures 3 D and 4 C). The frequencies of memory CD4 + T cells generated by BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV.2S were not significantly different than SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figures 3 D and 4 C). Memory cTfh cell frequencies were similar between all four vaccines and infection ( Figure 3 F). Overall, all four of the COVID-19 vaccines generated memory CD4 + T cells in the majority of vaccinated individuals, with representation of both Th1 (IFNγ + ) and Tfh memory, with memory CD4-CTL also generated by mRNA and NVX-CoV2373 vaccines. Additionally, the magnitude of spike-specific CD4 + T cell memory was generally higher for mRNA vaccines and NVX-CoV2373 than seen in COVID-19 recovered individuals.
SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD8 + T cells were measured by ICS at all time points to identify IFNγ, TNFα, or IL-2 producing cells (CD69 + cytokine + gating = “ICS + ”. Figures 5 and S4 ) for all vaccine modalities. Spike-specific CD8 + T cells were also measured by AIM (CD69 + CD137 + , Figures S4 E–S4G).
For the mRNA-1273 vaccine, 83% of vaccinees had detectable spike-specific CD8 + T cell responses after the first immunization ( Figure 5 C). ICS + CD8 + T cell response rates peaked after the second immunization (87% T3 responders, Figure 5 C). Spike-specific memory CD8 + T cells were largely maintained out to 6 months after mRNA-1273 vaccination (67% responders, Figure 5 C), with only a 2.3-fold decline in geomean frequency from the peak (0.077%–0.033%, Figure 5 C). Both acute and memory CD8 + T cell responses were dominated by IFNγ-producing cells ( Figures 5 B, 5C, S4A, S4B and S4I), the majority of which co-expressed GzB ( Figure S4 I). The majority of the memory spike-specific CD8 + T cells exhibited an effector memory (T EM ) surface phenotype ( Figure S4 J).
For the BNT162b2 vaccine, IFNγ + and total ICS + CD8 + T cell responses also peaked after the second immunization (T3 73 and 85% responders, respectively Figures 5 B and 5C). Memory CD8 + T cells were maintained out to 6 months after BNT162b2 vaccination (64% responders, Figure 5 C), with only a 2-fold decline in geomean frequency ( Figure 5 C). Multifunctional spike-specific memory CD8 + T cells were more common in mRNA-1273 compared to BNT162b2 vaccinees ( Figures 5 C, S4 H, and S4I), with the responses dominated by IFNγ + cells ( Figures 5 C, S4H, and S4I). Overall, spike-specific CD8 + T cell acute and memory responses to BNT162b2 were similar to mRNA-1273 but slightly lower in frequency and multifunctionality.
The fraction of CD8 + T cell responders to Ad26.COV2.S was lower than both mRNA vaccines (67% compared to 87 and 85%, Figure 5 C). Nevertheless, Ad26.COV2.S spike-specific CD8 + T cell frequencies were relatively stable through 6 months post-vaccination ( Figures 5 B, 5C, S4A, and S4B) and geomean frequencies of memory CD8 + T cells after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination were comparable to both mRNA vaccines at 6 months ( Figures 5 B, 5C, S4A, and S4B). The estimated t 1/2 for memory CD8 + T cells at 6 months post-mRNA1273 or Ad26.COV2.S was greater than 1 year ( t 1/2 449 and 381 days, respectively. 95% Cls: 101 to ∞ days, and 89 to ∞ days, respectively).
For the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine, spike-specific ICS + memory CD8 + T cells were observed in 10%–50% of donors (T4 and T5, Figure 5 C). There were minimal multifunctional CD8 + T cells ( Figures 5 C, S4H, and S4 I).
Overall, memory CD8 + T cell frequencies and response rates were similar between mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2.S immunizations. Low but detectable memory CD8 + T cells were observed in some individuals after NVX-CoV2373 immunization. CD8 + T cell responses to all COVID-19 vaccines were dominated by IFNγ-producing cells. No differences in IFNγ MFI were observed between memory CD8 + T cells generated for each of the vaccines ( Figure S4 D). All vaccines elicited IFNγ + memory CD8 + cells ( Figure S4 C) and AIM + memory CD8 + cells ( Figure S4 G) at frequencies comparable to, or slightly higher than, frequencies observed in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals at six months ( Figures S4 C and S4G).
Next, we sought to characterize and compare the development of B cell memory across the four different COVID-19 vaccines. For that, we utilized spike and RDB probes to identify, quantify and phenotypically characterize memory B cells from vaccinated subjects at 3.5 (T4) and 6 months (T5) after immunization ( Figures 6 A, 6B, and S5 A). Spike-specific and RBD-specific memory B cells were detected in all vaccinated subjects at 6 months ( Figures 6 C and 6D). RBD-specific memory B cells comprised 15 to 20% of the spike-specific memory B cell population, on average ( Figure S5 B). Immunization with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 led to higher frequencies of spike-specific and RBD-specific memory B cells compared to Ad26.COV2.S and NVX-CoV2373 at 3.5 and 6 months (each p < 0.01. Figures 6 C and 6D).
Memory B cell responses to the four vaccines did not exhibit the same kinetics as the antibody responses. The frequency of spike-specific memory B cells increased over time, (mRNA-1273, p = 0.017; BNT162b2, p = 0.0018, Ad26.COV2.S, p = 0.021. Figure 6 C). RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies increased at 6 months after mRNA-1273 (1.7-fold, p = 0.024), BNT162b2 (2.2-fold, p = 0.06), Ad26.COV2.S (2.1-fold, p = 0.06), and NVX-CoV2373 (3.05-fold, p = 0.033) ( Figure 6 D).
RBD-specific memory B cell isotypes were mostly comparable among the different vaccines, with an average distribution of 83% IgG, 2.5% IgM, and 2.2% IgA at 6 months (donut graphs, Figures 6 D and S5 C); however, IgA + RBD-specific memory B cells were higher at 3.5 months in mRNA vaccinees compared to Ad26.COV2.S (mRNA-1273 p = 0.003. BNT162b2 p = 0.04. Figure 6 D). Phenotypically, activated memory B cells (CD21 − CD27 + ) comprised 49% of spike-specific memory B cells after mRNA vaccination ( Figure S6 B), which was significantly higher than observed for Ad26.COV2.S or NVX-CoV2373 (mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vs. Ad26.COV2.S, p < 0.0001. mRNA-1273 vs. NVX-CoV2373, p = 0.0027; BNT162b2 vs. NVX-CoV2373 p = 0.0038 ( Figure S6 B), and these differences persisted at 6 months ( Figure 6 E). Reciprocally, the representation of classical memory B cells (CD21 + CD27 + ) was lower in response to mRNA vaccines ( Figures 6 F and S6 C). The frequency of atypical memory B cells (CD21 − CD27 − ) was low and comparable among vaccines ( Figure S6 D). To further qualitatively compare memory B cells across vaccine platforms, we assessed CD71, CXCR3, CD95, and CD11c expression on spike-specific memory B cells. No differences in CD11c were observed ( Figure S6 I). CD71 + memory B cells were more common at 3.5 months in response to mRNA vaccines than Ad26.COV2.S or NVX-CoV2373 (T4 Figure 6 G), with higher expression on activated memory B cells ( Figure S6 E). Considering that CD71 is a proliferation marker of B cells, this may reflect greater continuing production of memory B cells in response to mRNA vaccines at 3.5 months compared to Ad26.COV2.S and NVX-CoV2373 vaccines. At 6 months, the frequency of CD71 + spike-specific memory B cells remained elevated for mRNA-1273 ( Figure S6 F).
CXCR3 + spike-specific memory B cell frequencies were substantially higher in response to Ad26.COV2.S compared to the other vaccine platforms (mRNA-1273 p < 0.001, BNT162b2 p < 0.001, NVX-CoV2373 p = 0.008. Figure 6 H) and remained elevated at 6 months ( Figure S6 G). In previously infected individuals, ∼40% of spike-binding memory B cells were CXCR3 + at 6 months post-symptom onset (PSO), which was significantly higher than the ∼7% CXCR3 + observed from mRNA vaccinees at 6 months ( Figure S6 G). Since CXCR3 expression during viral responses can be driven by the transcription factor Tbet, we assessed the frequency of Tbet + spike-specific memory B cells. There was a trend toward higher Tbet expression in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinees ( Figure S6 J). Atypical memory B cells or “age-associated B cells” are often Tbet + and express CXCR3 ( Rubtsova et al., 2015 53. Rubtsova, K. ∙ Rubtsov, A.V. ∙ Cancro, M.P. ... Age-associated B cells: a T-bet-dependent effector with roles in protective and pathogenic immunity J. Immunol. 2015; 195 :1933-1937 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, atypical memory B cells are rare in response to these COVID-19 vaccines by the CD21 − CD27 − cell definition ( Figure S6 D). Furthermore, while CD95 + spike-specific memory B cells were increased in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinees ( Figure S6 H), CD11c or CD95 expression was not selectively observed on CXCR3 + compared to CXCR3 - spike-binding memory B cells ( Figure S6 K and S6L); and, by performing quadrant gating, the majority of the spike-specific memory B cell enrichment in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinees was CXCR3 + CD95 − CD11c − cells ( Figure S6 M and S6N). In sum, using multiple approaches to characterize the CXCR3 + memory B cells, and to classify atypical B cells, our data suggest that atypical memory B cells are uncommon in response to any of the COVID-19 vaccines analyzed here, whereas CXCR3 + memory B cells are substantially generated in response to Ad26.COV2.S immunization or SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Lastly, the frequencies of spike-specific and RBD-specific memory B cells at 6 months post-vaccination were comparable to the frequencies found in previously infected subjects at 6 months ( Figures 6 I and 6J), indicating robust memory B cell development in response to each of the four COVID-19 vaccines.
We performed multiparametric analyses, utilizing both correlation matrixes and principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the relative immunogenicity of the four vaccines ( Figures 7 and S7 ). Considering all parameters of vaccine antigen-specific immune responses at 6 months after mRNA (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2) or Ad26.COV2.S vaccination ( Figures S7 A and S7B), we observed strong correlations between spike IgG, RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody titers ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and 7F). Neutralizing antibody titers correlated with spike-specific and RBD-specific memory B cells for mRNA vaccinees at 6 months ( Figures 7 A, 7C, and 7D). Antibody levels and memory CD4 + T cells were significantly associated in mRNA vaccinees by multiple metrics ( Figures 7 A and 7E). In contrast, no relationship was observed between antibodies and memory CD8 + T cells ( Figure 7 A). Memory CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells were significantly cross-correlated in mRNA vaccinees ( Figure S7 A). For Ad26.COV2.S vaccination, no significant correlations were detected at 6 months between antibodies, memory B cells, memory CD4 + T cells, or memory CD8 + T cells, which may be related to the smaller cohort size ( Figures 7 A and 7G–7I).
Next, we tested for relationships between early immune responses and immune memory ( Figures 7 J–7N and S7C–S7H). Peak post-second mRNA immunization cTfh CD4 + T cells were strongly associated with 6-month antibody levels ( Figures 7 J–7L, S7C, and S7D), providing an early indicator of long-term humoral immunity. Early RBD IgG titers after the first mRNA immunization were positively associated with 6-month RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies ( Figures S7 G and S7H). For both mRNA and Ad26.COV2.S, peak ICS + CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses significantly cross-correlated (T3, Figure 7 J). Overall, these observations suggest that early peak CD4 + T cells responses had a lasting effect on the humoral response.
PCA mapping was performed using 3.5-month ( Figure S7 I) and 6-month ( Figure 7 O) post-vaccination data. PCA discriminated mRNA-1273 and Ad26.COV2.S, indicating these two vaccines generated distinct immunological profiles ( Figure 7 O). BNT162b2 largely developed the same profile as mRNA-1273 but with more heterogeneity. NVX-CoV2373 generated an immune memory profile overlapping with that of mRNA and adenoviral vectors ( Figure 7 O). Prominent immunological features distinguishing between mRNA and Ad26.COV2.S were CXCR3 + spike-specific memory B cells, ICS + memory CD4 + T cells, CD71 + memory B cells, and spike IgG ( Figures 7 O and S7 I). Notably, neutralizing antibody titers and CXCR3 + spike-specific memory B cells were correlated for Ad26.COV2.S vaccinees (r = 0.44, p = 0.04) but not mRNA vaccinees (mRNA-1273, p = 0.25. BNT162b2, p = 0.79. Figure 7 P), corroborating the immunologically distinct outcomes. Overall, substantial relationships were observed between multiple components of immune memory for these COVID-19 vaccines, with distinct immune memory profiles for different vaccine platforms.

Section: Discussion

COVID-19 vaccines have achieved extraordinary success in protection from infection and disease, yet some limitations exist, including differences in VE between vaccines and waning of protection against infection over a period of several months. Here, diverse metrics of adaptive responses were measured to mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, and NVX-CoV2373, with implications for understanding the protection against COVID-19 associated with each of the vaccines. A strength of this study is that the samples from different vaccine platforms were obtained from the same blood processing facility, from the same geographical location, and were analyzed concomitantly, utilizing the same experimental platform.
In the present study, antibody responses were detected in 100% of individuals. At 6 months post-immunization, the neutralizing antibody titer hierarchy between the vaccines was mRNA-1273∼BNT162b2∼NVX-CoV2373 > Ad26.COV2.S. These serological data are consistent with previous reports for single vaccines ( Atmar et al., 2022 1. Atmar, R.L. ∙ Lyke, K.E. ∙ Deming, M.E. ...

Comparisons of NVX-CoV2373 antibody responses compared to other vaccines after 6 months have been very limited. Here we observed that NVX-CoV2373 neutralizing antibody titers were comparable to that of BNT162b2 and only moderately lower than mRNA-1273.
In this side-by-side comparative study, spike-specific CD4 + T cell responses were detected in 100% of individuals to all four vaccines. While neutralizing antibody kinetics were different between mRNA and viral vector vaccines, the CD4 + T cell response kinetics were similar. The hierarchy of the magnitude of the memory CD4 + T cells was mRNA-1273 > BNT162b2∼NVX-CoV2373 > Ad26.COV2.S.

Interestingly, multifunctional CD4 + T cells were observed most frequently after mRNA-1273 immunization, and GzB + early CD4-CTLs represented a substantial fraction of the memory CD4 + T cells after mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, or NVX-CoV2373 vaccination. cTfh memory cells were represented as a substantial fraction of CD4 + T cell memory for each of the four vaccines, consistent with these vaccine platforms being selected for their ability to induce antibody responses. Memory CD4 + T cell responses were also compared to infected individuals, demonstrated that each vaccine was successful in generating circulating spike-specific CD4 + T cell memory frequencies similar to or higher than SARS-CoV-2 infection, though of course infection also generates responses to other viral antigens.
The two mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S induced comparable acute and memory CD8 + T cell frequencies. These data are broadly consistent with previous reports for mRNA vaccines or adenoviral vectors ( Goel et al., 2021 18.

Med. 2021; 385 :2010-2012 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ), compared to the overnight stimulation used here. As expected for a protein-based vaccine, IFNγ + memory CD8 + T cell frequencies after NVX-CoV2373 were lower than the other vaccine platforms assessed, but it was notable that NVX-CoV2373 generated spike-specific CD8 + T cell memory in a significant fraction of individuals, and the IFNγ + spike-specific memory CD8 + T cell frequencies were similar at 6 months between NVX-CoV2373 immunizations and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Spike- and RBD-specific memory B cell responses were detected in all individuals to each of the four vaccines. While neutralizing antibody titers declined over time in mRNA vaccinees, the frequency of spike-specific memory B cells increased over time. These divergent antibody and memory B cell kinetics were also observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Dan et al., 2021 10. Dan, J.M. ∙ Mateus, J. ∙ Kato, Y. ... Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection Science. 2021; 371 Crossref Scopus (1829) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mRNA vaccine data are comparable to Goel et al. (2021) 18. Goel, R.R. ∙ Painter, M.M. ∙ Apostolidis, S.A. ... mRNA vaccines induce durable immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern Science. 2021; 374 :abm0829 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar , but memory B cell data and kinetics for the Ad26.COV2.S or NVX-CoV2373 vaccines have not previously been available. At 6 months post-immunization, the spike-specific memory B cell hierarchy was mRNA1273∼BNT162b2 > Ad26.COV2.S > NVX-CoV2373. One of the most differentiating features of Ad26.COV2.S immunization observed here was the high frequency of CXCR3 + memory B cells. CXCR3 + memory B cells were correlated with neutralizing antibody titers after Ad26.COV2.S immunization, but not mRNA immunization, suggesting a specific functional role in viral vector B cell responses. CXCR3 expression was present on most memory B cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Fig. S6 G). CXCR3 expression on memory B cells has been found to be important for mucosal immunity in two mouse models ( Oh et al., 2019 44. Oh, J.E. ∙ Iijima, N. ∙ Song, E. ... Migrant memory B cells secrete luminal antibody in the vagina Nature. 2019; 571 :122-126 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 45. Oh, J.E. ∙ Song, E. ∙ Moriyama, M. ... Intranasal priming induces local lung-resident B cell populations that secrete protective mucosal antiviral IgA Science Immunology. 2021; 6 :eabj5129 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). CXCR3 ligands are also expressed in infection-induced IFNγ inflammation in non-mucosal sites.
Between the mRNA vaccines, mRNA-1273 elicited more immune memory than BNT162b2. Vaccine dose and timing are likely explanations for the observed differences. mRNA-1273 contains 100 μg mRNA, while BNT162b2 contains 30 μg. In a clinical trial of mRNA-1273, a 25 μg dose elicited somewhat lower neutralizing antibody and memory CD4 + T cell responses than the 100 μg dose ( Mateus et al., 2021 35. Mateus, J. ∙ Dan, J.M. ∙ Zhang, Z. ... Low-dose mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine generates durable memory enhanced by cross-reactive T cells Science. 2021; 374 :eabj9853 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the differences between 25 and 100 μg mRNA-1273 were comparable to the differences observed here between 100 μg mRNA-1273 and 30 μg BNT162b2. The time interval between the first and second mRNA dose may also contribute to the differences in the frequencies and phenotypes of memory T cells between mRNA1273 and BNT162b2. Memory T cells with high proliferative potential are typically not generated until several weeks after a first immunization ( Sallusto et al., 2010 57. Sallusto, F. ∙ Lanzavecchia, A. ∙ Araki, K. ... From vaccines to memory and back Immunity. 2010; 33 :451-463 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, a second immunization prior to maximal establishment of memory T cells after the first dose may contribute to sub-optimal T cell memory later. A longer time interval likely also contributes to higher quality memory B cell responses, as observed for SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccines ( Cho et al., 2021 5. Cho, A. ∙ Muecksch, F. ∙ Schaefer-Babajew, D. ... Anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain antibody evolution after mRNA vaccination Nature. 2021; 600 :517-522 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ; Muecksch et al., 2022 39.

Increased potency and Breadth of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after a Third mRNA vaccine dose bioRxiv. 2022; 2022.2002.2014.480394 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and other contexts ( Lee et al., 2021 30. Lee, J.H. ∙ Sutton, H. ∙ Cottrell, C.A. ... Long-lasting germinal center responses to a priming immunization with continuous proliferation and somatic mutation bioRxiv. 2021; 2021.2012.2020.473537 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Across the antigen-specific immune metrics assessed, mRNA vaccines were consistently the most immunogenic, with levels higher than or equal to that of Ad26.COV2.S and NVX-CoV2373 vaccines for each immune response. NVX-CoV2373 elicited CD4 + T cell memory and neutralizing antibody titers comparably to the mRNA vaccines. The responses induced by the Ad26.COV2.S were generally lower but relatively stable. The mRNA vaccine platforms were associated with substantial declines in neutralizing antibody titers over 6 months, while memory CD4 + T cells, memory CD8 + T cells, and memory B cells exhibited small reductions (T cells) or increases (B cells). These observations appear to be consistent with the relatively high degree of protection maintained against hospitalizations with COVID-19 after these vaccines over 6 months, and the differential VE reported between mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S. These results of detailed immunological evaluations, coupled with analyses of VE data published for the various vaccine platforms, may also be relevant for other vaccine efforts.

A total of 354 peripheral blood samples were obtained from 102 participants who received either the Moderna mRNA-1273 (n = 30), Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 (n = 30), Janssen Ad26.COV2.S (n = 30) and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 vaccines (n = 12), according to the approved dose schedule. Blood sample collection schedules are shown in Figure 1 B. For baseline determinations, for a subset of donors, blood samples were collected before vaccination (T1). T2 was 2 weeks (targeting 15 ± 3 days) after the first immunization. T3 was 2 weeks after the second immunization, or approximately day 45 after the first immunization for the 1-dose Ad26.COV2.S. T4 was 3.5 months after the first dose. T5 was 6 months after the first dose. An overview of all samples analyzed in this study is provided in Figure 1 C.
Both cohorts of mRNA vaccinees (mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2) received two doses of the vaccine (28 and 21 days apart, respectively). In the case of the Novavax NVX-CoV2373, we advertised locally to recruit subjects who had participated in an investigational NVX-CoV2373 trial conducted in the San Diego region, where two intramuscular 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo were administered 21 days apart ( Clinicaltrials.gov ). The NVX-CoV2373 trial was structured such that donors initially received two doses of placebo or vaccine in a blinded manner and were then provided two doses of the opposite (vaccine or placebo), such that all participants were vaccinated. The gap between dose two and dose three for the LJI recruited cohort was 53 ± 38 days ( Figure 1 B); participants were blinded to their immunization regimen, and LJI had no information on which group the participants were in. All experiments performed at the La Jolla Institute (LJI) were approved by the institutional review boards (IRB) of the La Jolla Institute (IRB#: VD-214).
To avoid any batch effect all of the samples and cells in this study were collected, processed and stored by the clinical core at LJI following the same standard operating procedures. Experimental characterization of antibody and B cell responses were carried out by one person, utilizing the exact same protocol and same experimental equipment. T cell assay sample batching and standardization is described in sections below. After all experiments were run, experimentalists were unblinded to allow of vaccine specific analysis and data interpretation.
To compare levels of immune memory responses induced by any of the vaccine platforms to immune memory responses induced by infection with SARS-CoV-2, samples were used from individuals that experienced infection with SARS-CoV-2, originally reported in ( Mateus et al., 2021 35. Mateus, J. ∙ Dan, J.M. ∙ Zhang, Z. ... Low-dose mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine generates durable memory enhanced by cross-reactive T cells Science. 2021; 374 :eabj9853 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). We matched the 7 months (209 days) post-vaccination samples with samples from convalescent donors collected on average 181 days (range 170–195) post symptoms onset (PSOB cell experiments were repeated for nine donors of this cohort and new five donors. The five new donors were selected randomly based to match the timepoint post symptom onset of the other samples. Seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by ELISA, as described below. At the time of enrollment, all COVID-19 convalescent donors provided informed consent to participate in the present and future studies.
Before analyzing the entire dataset for our cohort, we generated exclusion criteria as follows: subjects who tested positive for RBD and neutralization antibodies at baseline were excluded (one subject, mRNA-1273); subjects with no baseline sample available and whose RBD and neutralization antibody reached the peak after first-dose immunization (indicative of memory from previous infection) and were nucleocapsid (NC) antibody-positive were also excluded as previously infected subjects (one subject, mRNA-1273). In addition, any time points following a confirmed COVID-19 booster immunization were excluded for any subject (five subjects, BNT162b2, two Ad26.COV2.S, two NVX-CoV2373).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma isolation.
Whole blood samples from subjects vaccinated with the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, or NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent samples after COVID-19 infection were collected at La Jolla Institute in heparin-coated blood bags and centrifuged for 15 min at 803 g to separate the cellular fraction and plasma. Blood samples were collected at the times described above. The plasma was then carefully removed from the cell pellet and stored at minus 20 °C. PBMCs were isolated by density-gradient sedimentation using Ficoll-Paque (Lymphoprep, Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway) as previously described ( Dan et al., 2021 10.

Isolated PBMCs were cryopreserved in cell recovery media containing 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Gibco), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan UT), and stored in liquid nitrogen until used in the assays. Plasma samples were used for antibody measurements by ELISA and PSV neutralization assay and PBMC samples were used for flow cytometry in the T cell and B cell assays.

Briefly, 96-well half-area plates (ThermoFisher 3690) were coated with 1 𝑢 g/mL of antigen and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Antigens included recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein and spike protein, both obtained from the Saphire laboratory at LJI, and recombinant nucleocapsid protein (GenScript Z03488). The next day, plates were blocked with 3% milk in PBS (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1.5 h at room temperature. Plasma was heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 to 60 min. Plasma was diluted in 1% milk containing 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS starting at a 1:3 dilution followed by serial dilutions by three and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Plates were washed five times with 0.05% PBS-Tween-20. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% milk containing 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Anti-human IgG peroxidase antibody produced in goat (Sigma A6029) was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Plates were read on Spectramax Plate Reader at 450 nm, and data analysis was performed using SoftMax Pro.
End-point titers were plotted for each sample, using background-subtracted data. Negative and positive controls were used to standardize each assay and normalize across experiments. A positive control standard was created by pooling plasma from six convalescent COVID-19 donors to normalize between experiments. The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as 1:3 of IgG. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for COVID-19 vaccinated individuals were established based on pre-vaccinated individuals (timepoint 1) and set as the titer at which 95% of pre-vaccinated samples (T1) fell below the dotted line ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Titers, LOD, and LOQ were calibrated to the WHO International Reference Panel for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike, RBD, and nucleocapsid binding antibody units per milliliter (WHO BAU/mL). For Spike IgG, the LOD was 0.20 with a LOQ of 1.024 ( Figures 2 A and 2D). For RBD IgG, the LOD was 0.83 with a LOQ of 7.12 ( Figures 2 B and 2E). For NC IgG, the LOD was 0.68 with a LOQ of 30.48 ( Figure S1 A).
For comparison among mRNA-1273, BNT162b, and Ad26.COV2.S over the entire 6 + month time period, log 10 transformed end-point titers (WHO BAU/mL) were used to generate area under the curve (AUC) for each donor ( Figures S1 B-D). Donors with only one timepoint excluded. If there was no (T1), T1 was set as the LOD ET (BAU/mL). Correction factors for AUCs were determined by the number of time points and normalized to compare donor to donor. For comparison among mRNA-1273, BNT162b, Ad26.COV2.S, and NVZ-CoV2373 over the 3.5 months–6 months period, log 10 transformed end-point titers (WHO BAU/mL) were used to generate area under the curve (AUC) for each donor ( Figures S1 E-G). Donors with only one timepoint excluded. Kruskal-Wallis tests for AUC were <0.0001 for Figures S1 B-G. Comparison between different vaccines were made by Mann-Whitney. Values plotted show GMT with GM SD
To calculate the spike IgG half-life ( t 1/2 ) for the memory time point, a simple linear regression was performed using log 2 -transformed T4-T5 paired data. The mean and 95% Cl of t 1/2 were described in the Results section.
The PSV neutralization assays in samples from vaccinated subjects were performed as previously described ( Dan et al., 2021 10. Dan, J.M. ∙ Mateus, J. ∙ Kato, Y. ...

Briefly, 2.5×10 4 VERO cells (ATCC, Cat. No. CCL-81) were seeded in clear flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific, Cat. No. 165305) to produce a monolayer at the time of infection. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S-D614G pseudotyped VSV-ΔG-GFP were generated by transfecting HEK293T cells (ATCC, Cat. No. CRL-321) with plasmid phCMV3-SARS-CoV2-Spike kindly provided by Dr. E. Saphire and then infecting with VSV-ΔG-GFP. Pre-titrated rVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-D614G was incubated with serially diluted human heat-inactivated plasma at 37 °C for 1–1.5 h before addition to confluent VERO cell monolayers. Cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 (Santa Cruz, Cat. No. sc-281692) with 10 μg/mL of Hoechst (Thermo Scientific, Cat. No. 62249), and imaged using a CellInsight CX5 imager to quantify the total number of cells and infected GFP expressing cells to determine the percentage of infection. Neutralization titers or inhibition dose 50 (ID50) were calculated using the One-Site Fit Log IC50 model in Prism 9.3 (GraphPad). As internal quality control to define the variation inter-assay, a pooled plasma (secondary standard) from 10 donors who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine was included across the PSV neutralization assays. Samples that did not reach 50% inhibition at the lowest serum dilution of 1:20 were considered as non-neutralizing and the values were set to 19. PSV neutralization titers were done with two replicates per experiment. We included the WHO International Reference Panel for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (20/268) to calibrate our PSV neutralization titers. The WHO IU calibrated neutralization ID50 (cID50-IU/mL) was graphed in figures. The limit of detection was calculated as 10.73 IU/mL.
All T cell assays were carried out by two independent investigators (JMT and CMR) on the same model analyzer (Cytek Aurora). To ensure comparability between results, all samples were distributed in a blinded fashion and subjects which received different vaccines were distributed between the batches. All timepoints (T1-T5) from a given donor were run in the same experiment, including a positive and negative control for each donor. Furthermore, each independent experiment included a sample of the same control donor, with known SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T cell reactivity. Deviation from the expected reactivity resulted in repetition of the experiment. Details of the T cell assays are provided below. After all experiments were run, experimentalists were unblinded to allow of vaccine specific analysis and data interpretation.
We have previously developed the MP approach to allow simultaneous testing of a large number of epitopes, as reported previously ( Grifoni et al., 2020 19.

According to this approach, large numbers of different epitopes are solubilized, pooled, and re-lyophilized to avoid cell toxicity problems associated with high concentrations of DMSO typically encountered when single pre-solubilized epitopes are pooled ( Grifoni et al., 2020 19.

Here, were used for ex vivo stimulation of PBMCs for flow cytometry an MP to evaluate the antigen-specific T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 spike. We used a Spike MP of 253 overlapping peptides spanning the entire sequence of the Spike protein. As this peptide pool consists of peptides with a length of 15 amino acids, both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have the capacity to recognize this MP, as described previously ( Dan et al., 2021 10.

The AIM assays in samples from subjects vaccinated with mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, or NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine were performed as previously described ( Dan et al., 2021 10.

Spike-specific CD4 + T cells were measured as a percentage of OX40 + CD137 + AIM + or OX40 + sCD40L + AIM + and spike-specific CD8 + T cells were measured as a percentage of CD69 + CD137 + AIM + CD8 + T cells after stimulation of PBMCs from subjects vaccinated with the Spike MP. Also, spike-specific circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells (CXCR5 + OX40 + CD40L + , as a percentage of CD4 + T cells) were defined by the AIM assay. Briefly, prior to the addition of the Spike MP, PBMCs were blocked at 37 °C for 15 min with 0.5 μg/mL anti-CD40 mAb (Miltenyi Biotec). Then, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence of fluorescently labeled chemokine receptor antibodies (anti-CCR6, CXCR5, CXCR3, and CCR7) and the Spike MP (1 μg/mL) in 96-wells U-bottom plates, as previously described ( Mateus et al., 2021 35.

In addition, PBMCs were incubated with an equimolar amount of DMSO as negative control and with phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/mL) (PHA, Roche) as a positive control. For the surface stain, 1×10 6 PBMCs were resuspended in PBS, incubated with BD human FC block (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and the LIVE/DEAD marker in the dark for 15 min and washed with PBS. Then, the antibody mix containing the rest of the surface antibodies was added directly to cells and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in the dark. Following surface staining, cells were then washed twice with PBS containing 3% FBS (FACS buffer). All samples were acquired on a Cytek Aurora (Cytek Biosciences, Fremont, CA). A list of antibodies used in this panel can be found in table S1 and a representative gating strategy of spike-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells using the AIM assay is shown in Figure S2 , respectively.
Spike-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were measured as background (DMSO) subtracted data, with a minimal DMSO level set to 0.005%. Response >0.02% and a stimulation index (SI) > 2 for CD4 + and >0.03% and SI > 3 for CD8 + T cells were considered positive. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for antigen-specific CD4 + T cell responses (0.03%) and antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses (0.05%) was calculated using the median 2-fold SD of all negative controls.
The ICS assays in samples from subjects vaccinated with mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, or NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine were performed as previously described ( Mateus et al., 2021 35. Mateus, J. ∙ Dan, J.M. ∙ Zhang, Z. ...

Prior to the addition of the Spike MP, PBMC were blocked at 37 °C for 15 min with 0.5 μg/mL anti-CD40 mAb, as previously described ( Mateus et al., 2021 35. Mateus, J. ∙ Dan, J.M. ∙ Zhang, Z. ...

PBMCs were cultured in the presence of the Spike MP (1 μg/mL) for 20 h at 37 °C in 96-wells U-bottom plates. In addition, cells were incubated with an equimolar amount of DMSO as a negative control. After 20 h, Golgi-Plug and Golgi-Stop were added to the culture for 4 h along with the anti-CD69 Ab. Cells were then washed, incubated with BD human FC block, and stained with the LIVE/DEAD marker as described above. Then, cells were washed and surface stained for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark and fixed with 1% of paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Subsequently, cells were permeated and stained with intracellular antibodies for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. All samples were acquired on a Cytek Aurora. Antibodies used in the ICS assay are listed in table S2 and a representative gating strategy of spike-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells producing IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2 and/or GzB using the ICS assay is shown in Figures 4 A and 5 A.
To define the spike-specific T cells by the ICS assay, we gated the cytokine- or GzB-producing cells together with the expression of iCD40L or CD69 on CD4 + or CD8 + T cells, respectively ( Figures 4 A and 5 A). Then, a Boolean analysis was performed to define the multifunctional profiles on FlowJo 10.8.1. The overall response to spike, denoted as Secreted-effector + (IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, and/or GzB) or Cytokine + (IFNγ, TNFα, and/or IL-2), was defined as the sum of the background-subtracted responses to each combination of individual cytokines or GzB. The total spike-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells producing IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, and/or GzB are shown in Figures 4 and 5 and Figure S3-4 . To define the multifunctional profiles of spike-specific T cells, all positive background-subtracted data (>0.005% and an SI > 2 for CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells) was aggregated into a combined sum of antigen-specific CD4 + or CD8 + T cells based on the number of functions. Values higher than the LOQ (0.01%) were considered for the analysis of the multifunctional spike-specific T cell responses. The average of the relative CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses was calculated per donor and visit to define the proportion of multifunctional spike-specific T cell responses with one, two, three, and four functions ( Figures 4 B, 5 C, S3 A-B and S4 H-I).
To calculate the ICS + CD8 + T cell and AIM + CD4 + T cell half-life ( t 1/2 ) for the memory time point, a simple linear regression was performed using log 2 -transformed T4-T5 paired data. The mean and 95% Cl of t 1/2 were described in the Result section.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells (MBCs) in samples from subjects vaccinated with mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, or NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine was performed using B cell probes as previously described ( Dan et al., 2021 10. Dan, J.M. ∙ Mateus, J. ∙ Kato, Y. ... Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection Science. 2021; 371 Crossref Scopus (1829) PubMed Google Scholar ) Biotinylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was purchased from Acro Biosystems and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) was purchased from BioLegend.
To enhance specificity, identification of both spike- and RBD-specific MBCs was performed using two fluorochromes for each protein. Thus, the biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike was incubated with either Alexa Fluor 647 or BV421 at a 20:1 ratio (∼6:1 M ratio) for 1 h at 4 °C. Biotinylated RBD was conjugated with BV711 or PE-Cy7 at a 2.2:1 ratio (∼4:1 M ratio). Streptavidin PE-Cy5.5 was used as a decoy probe to minimize background by eliminating SARS-CoV-2 nonspecific streptavidin-binding B cells. Then, 9×10 6 PBMCs were placed in U-bottom 96 well plates and stained with a solution consisting of 5 μM of biotin to avoid cross-reactivity among probes, 20 ng of decoy probe, 211 ng of Spike and 31.25 ng of RBD per sample, diluted in Brilliant Buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4°C, protected from light. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with surface antibodies ( table S3 ) diluted in Brilliant Staining Buffer for 30 min at 4 °C in dark. Viability staining was performed using Live/Dead Fixable Blue Stain Kit diluted at 1:200 in PBS and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. For T-bet staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized in 100 uL of eBioscience Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 88-8824-00) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with 1X BD Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences, catalog no. 554723) and stained for T-bet in 50 uL of eBioscience Permeabilization Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 00-8333-56). Cells were subsequently washed twice in 1X BD Perm/Wash and resuspended in FACS buffer before acquisition. The acquisition was performed using Cytek Aurora. The frequency of antigen-specific MBCs was expressed as a percentage of total memory B cells (Singlets, Lymphocytes, Live, CD3– CD14– CD16– CD56–CD19+ CD20 + CD38int/– IgD– and/or CD27 + ). For every experiment, PBMCs from a known positive control (COVID-19 convalescent subject) and an unexposed subject were included to ensure consistent sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Limit of detection was calculated as median + 2x SD of [1/(number of total B cells recorded)]
Correlograms plotting the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r) between all paired parameters were created with the corrplot package (v0.84) running in Rstudio (1.1.456) as previously described ( Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020 54. Rydyznski Moderbacher, C. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ∙ Dan, J.M. ... Antigen-specific adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in acute COVID-19 and associations with age and disease severity Cell. 2020; 183 :996-1012 e1019 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1223) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spearman rank two-tailed p values were calculated using corr.mtest and graphed based on ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001. The codes used are: M = cor(DataFrame, method = "spearman", use = "pairwise.complete.obs") MP = cor.mtest(DataFrame, method = "spearman", use = "pairwise.complete.obs", conf.level = 0.95, exact = FALSE) corrplot(M, p.mat = MP$p, method = 'square', tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.7, tl.srt = 45, cl.align = "l", type = 'lower', sig.level = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05), pch.cex = 0.7, insig = 'label_sig', pch.col = 'white')
The “DataFrame” is the data from each correlation matrix shown in Figure 6 , collected and organized in spreadsheet.
The codes for PCA analysis are as follows:
res.pca = PCA(na.omit(MP), scale = TRUE)
fviz_eig(res.pca, addlabels = TRUE)
fviz_pca_biplot(res.pca, label = "var", labelsize = 3, repel = TRUE, geom.ind = "point", pointsize = 4, col.ind = Group$Vaccine, palette = c("darkgreen", "blue", "red", "purple"), col.var = "black", alpha.var = 0.5, addEllipses = TRUE, ellipse.alpha = 0, select.var = list(name = c("RBD IgG", "Spike IgG", "nAbs", "MBC", "aMBC", "cMBC", "CXCR3+ MBC", "AIM2+ CD4", "ICS + CD4", "ICS + CD8″)), ellipse.level = 0.8, legend.title = "Groups", invisible = "quali", title = "").
