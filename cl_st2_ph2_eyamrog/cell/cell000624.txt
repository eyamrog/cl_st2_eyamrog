Title: A family of conserved bacterial virulence factors dampens interferon responses by blocking calcium signaling


Abstract: Summary

Interferons (IFNs) induce an antimicrobial state, protecting tissues from infection. Many viruses inhibit IFN signaling, but whether bacterial pathogens evade IFN responses remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the Shigella OspC family of type-III-secreted effectors blocks IFN signaling independently of its cell death inhibitory activity. Rather, IFN inhibition was mediated by the binding of OspC1 and OspC3 to the Ca 2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM), blocking CaM kinase II and downstream JAK/STAT signaling. The growth of Shigella lacking OspC1 and OspC3 was attenuated in epithelial cells and in a murine model of infection. This phenotype was rescued in both models by the depletion of IFN receptors. OspC homologs conserved in additional pathogens not only bound CaM but also inhibited IFN, suggesting a widespread virulence strategy. These findings reveal a conserved but previously undescribed molecular mechanism of IFN inhibition and demonstrate the critical role of Ca 2+ and IFN targeting in bacterial pathogenesis.

Section: Introduction

Interferons (IFNs) are families of immunomodulatory cytokines produced in response to infection ( De Weerd and Nguyen, 2012 16. De Weerd, N.A. ∙ Nguyen, T. The interferons and their receptors—distribution and regulation Immunol. Cell Biol. 2012; 90 :483-491 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Type II (IFNγ) is the archetypal antibacterial IFN. Type I (IFNαs, β) and type III IFNs (IFNλ1-4) have been historically studied for their antiviral properties, but evidence of their antibacterial roles is emerging ( Burke et al., 2020 12.

A few ISGs have been established to have direct antibacterial functions ( Gaudet et al., 2021 26. Gaudet, R.G. ∙ Zhu, S. ∙ Halder, A. ...

For example, human guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) serves as a lipopolysaccharide sensor to activate Caspase 4. This facilitates activation of the noncanonical inflammasome, leading to inflammatory cell death and clearance of intracellular bacteria such as Shigella ( Kutsch et al., 2020 33.

Shigella spp. are Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae , and the major etiological agents of bacillary dysentery, also called shigellosis ( Trofa et al., 1999 74.

Shigellosis, predominantly caused by Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei , is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide ( Anderson et al., 2017 3.

Shigella sonnei infection of zebrafish reveals that O-antigen mediates neutrophil tolerance and dysentery incidence PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1008006 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following entry into the gastrointestinal tract, Shigella spp invade colonic epithelial cells, rupture their vacuole, and replicate in the cytosol. The pathogenesis of Shigella is dependent on its type III secretion system (T3SS), which is encoded on a large virulence plasmid. The T3SS serves as a molecular needle, injecting ∽30 effectors, which are highly conserved among Shigella spp., into the host cell to modulate multiple facets of cell physiology and establish a viable niche for infection ( Bajunaid et al., 2020 5.

Mapping of Shigella flexneri ’s tissue distribution and type III secretion apparatus activity during infection of the large intestine of guinea pigs Pathog. Dis. 2019; 77 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar ). Among these effectors, the OspC family is emerging as a potent modulator of host immune responses. It comprises the following 3 members: OspC1, OspC2, and OspC3. Despite sharing a high degree of sequence similarity, distinct functions of these effectors have been described. OspC1 was initially shown to promote neutrophil migration ( Zurawski et al., 2006 83. Zurawski, D.V. ∙ Mitsuhata, C. ∙ Mumy, K.L. ... OspF and OspC1 are Shigella flexneri type III secretion system effectors that are required for postinvasion aspects of virulence Infect. Immun. 2006; 74 :5964-5976 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent evidence demonstrated that OspC1 also inhibits Caspase 3/7-induced apoptosis, prolonging the survival of infected epithelial cells ( Ashida et al., 2020 4. Ashida, H. ∙ Sasakawa, C. ∙ Suzuki, T. A unique bacterial tactic to circumvent the cell death crosstalk induced by blockade of caspase-8 EMBO J. 2020; 39 :e104469 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). OspC3 blocks Caspase 4/11-mediated inflammatory cell death ( Kobayashi et al., 2013 31. Kobayashi, T. ∙ Ogawa, M. ∙ Sanada, T. ...

Viruses are extremely sensitive to IFN-induced responses, and almost all have evolved mechanisms that target components of IFN signaling cascades. Whether bacterial pathogens are capable of the same functions remains unknown. The emerging role of ISGs in the restriction of infection by intracellular bacteria such as Shigella led us to hypothesize that Shigella might counteract ISG expression. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved family of OspC effectors blocks IFN responses through binding and inhibition of the host Ca 2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) ( Berchtold and Villalobo, 2014 7. Berchtold, M.W. ∙ Villalobo, A. The many faces of calmodulin in cell proliferation, programmed cell death, autophagy, and cancer Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843 :398-435 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that a Shigella strain lacking OspC1 and OspC3 (Δ ospC1/C3 ) strain is attenuated in cell culture and in the murine gut in an IFN-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of IFN inhibition as a virulence strategy. Our data provide a mandate for future work on ISG targeting by bacterial pathogens but also noncanonical IFN inhibition as a common virulence mechanism.

Section: Results

To identify bacterial strategies that interfere with IFN signaling, we monitored the expression of ISGs in response to Shigella infection. We selected HeLa cells for these experiments as they show limited ISG induction in response to infection with Shigella but respond robustly to exogenous IFN ( Figure S1 A). Cells were infected with wild-type (WT) S. sonnei or a strain lacking a functional T3SS (Δ mxiD ). After 30 min, cells were treated with IFNβ for 4.5 h, and ISG expression was quantified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) ( Figure 1 A). As expected, the ISGs encoding Viperin and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide 1 ( IFIT1 ) were induced when uninfected (UI) cells were treated with IFNβ ( Figure 1 B). Infection with WT Shigella significantly inhibited ISG expression in response to IFNβ. This inhibition depended on the presence of a functional T3SS, as Δ mxiD Shigella infection did not suppress Viperin or IFIT1 expression. This finding implicates T3SS effectors as potential IFN signaling inhibitors. To identify candidate effectors, we utilized a 293T cell line engineered to express luciferase under the control of an interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) sequence, which is activated by type I and III IFNs ( Odendall and Kagan, 2015 50.

Cells expressing individual green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged effectors were treated with IFNβ for 18 h ( Figure 1 C). As a positive control, cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Chikungunya virus (ChikV) NSP2, a protein known to block IFN signaling ( Fros et al., 2010 24. Fros, J.J. ∙ Liu, W.J. ∙ Prow, N.A. ... Chikungunya virus nonstructural protein 2 inhibits type I/II interferon-stimulated JAK-STAT signaling J. Virol. 2010; 84 :10877-10887 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression of several effectors (blue bars) led to IFN inhibition at a level comparable with that mediated by NSP2 ( Figure 1 D). We chose to follow up on the OspC effector family that had previously been shown to modulate immune pathways ( Ashida et al., 2020 4. Ashida, H. ∙ Sasakawa, C. ∙ Suzuki, T.

Immun. 2006; 74 :5964-5976 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine the spectrum of IFN signaling pathways impacted by OspC family members, we examined the ability of each effector to interfere with type I, II, or III IFN activity. 293T cells cotransfected with each OspC effector and an ISRE reporter were treated with type I IFN (IFNα, IFNβ) or type III IFN (IFNλ1) ( Figures 1 C and 1E). Given that IFNγ induces a different set of ISGs that contain γ-activated sequences (GAS), IFNγ signaling was assessed following expression of a GAS reporter in HeLa cells ( Figures 1 C and 1E). ChikV NSP2 was used as a positive control, whereas OspD1, an effector that displayed no inhibition of ISRE in our initial screen ( Figure 1 D), served as a negative control. We found that OspC1 and OspC3 blocked signaling downstream of increasing concentrations of IFNs from all 3 families ( Figure 1 E). OspC2 potently inhibited IFNλ1 signaling but was far less efficient at blocking type I IFN signaling and unable to inhibit IFNγ.
We next confirmed that OspC effectors block the expression of endogenous ISGs by monitoring Viperin mRNA expression by qRT-PCR in OspC-expressing cells postexposure to IFNβ or IFNλ1 ( Figure 1 F). Consistent with the reporter analyses described above, OspC1 and OspC3 displayed the most potent ISG suppressive activity. To determine if OspCs globally suppressed ISG expression, we employed RNA-seq analysis of cells expressing the empty GFP control, OspC1 or OspC3, treated or not with IFNβ. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing IFNβ-treated GFP with OspC1- or OspC3-expressing cells to identify the hallmark pathways most affected by the presence of OspC family members. In both comparisons, IFN response pathways were among the top five pathways enriched in control samples (GFP) ( Figure S1 B), indicating global suppression of IFN response pathways by OspC. Finally, we tested whether ISG expression was blocked at the protein level by quantifying cell surface expression of the ISG Tetherin by flow cytometry. After gating on live transfected cells ( Figure S1 C), we found that Tetherin expression was blocked in cells expressing OspC1 and OspC3 ( Figure 1 G).
Next, we sought to determine if OspC family members translocated at endogenous levels by Shigella during infection impact IFN signaling. HeLa cells infected with WT Shigella or strains lacking either ospC1 , ospC3 , or both (Δ ospC1/C3 ) were treated with IFNβ, and ISG expression was assessed. As previously observed, infection with WT bacteria inhibited expression of Viperin and IFIT1 ( Figure 1 H). Infection with Δ ospC1 , Δ ospC3 , or Δ ospC1/C3 resulted in higher levels of IFNβ-mediated ISG expression than infection with WT bacteria ( Figure 1 H). Analysis of protein levels by western blot demonstrated that IFIT1 expression was also significantly diminished when cells infected with WT Shigella , but not strains lacking ospC1 and/or ospC3 , were exposed to IFNβ ( Figure 1 I and quantification Figure S1 D). These data indicate that OspC1 and OspC3 contribute to the inhibition of IFN signaling in epithelial cells infected with Shigella . However, when compared with Δ mxiD -infected cells, the rescue we observed in Δ ospC1/C3 -infected cells was only partial, likely suggesting a contribution from other effectors identified in our screen ( Figure 1 D).
OspC1 and OspC3 have previously been reported to inhibit cell death pathways. OspC1 targets an unknown host factor to inhibit Caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis ( Ashida et al., 2020 4. Ashida, H. ∙ Sasakawa, C. ∙ Suzuki, T. A unique bacterial tactic to circumvent the cell death crosstalk induced by blockade of caspase-8 EMBO J. 2020; 39 :e104469 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas OspC3 binds Caspase 4/11 to inhibit pyroptosis via its ADP-riboxanase activity ( Kobayashi et al., 2013 31. Kobayashi, T. ∙ Ogawa, M. ∙ Sanada, T. ... The Shigella OspC3 effector inhibits caspase-4, antagonizes inflammatory cell death, and promotes epithelial infection Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13 :570-583 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2021 37. Li, Z. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Fu, J. ... Shigella evades pyroptosis by arginine ADP-riboxanation of caspase-11 Nature. 2021; 599 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oh et al., 2021 53. Oh, C. ∙ Verma, A. ∙ Hafeez, M. ... Shigella OspC3 suppresses murine cytosolic LPS sensing iScience. 2021; 24 :102910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next investigated whether inhibition of IFN signaling by OspC1 and OspC3 was related to their cell death inhibition. Expression of OspC effectors in 293T cells in the absence or presence of IFNβ had no effect on host cell viability, as assessed by quantifying released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ( Figure S2 A), intracellular ATP—a marker of active metabolism ( Figure S2 B) or by using flow cytometry to determine the percentages of live versus dead cells ( Figures S2 C and S1 C). In addition, inhibition of pyroptosis and apoptosis with Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketon (Z-VAD-FMK) or necroptosis with necrosulfonamide had no effect on ISRE activation ( Figures S2 D and S2E). Finally, the inhibitory activities of OspC1 and OspC3 were identical in the presence of a DMSO vehicle control or cell death inhibitors ( Figures S2 D and S2F). These data demonstrate that expression of OspC1 or OspC3 in combination with IFN treatment is not cytotoxic. In addition, we show that pharmacological inhibition of pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis neither phenocopy OspC1 or OspC3 expression in blocking IFN signaling nor affect their ability to block IFN signaling.
Our prediction of the OspC3 tertiary structure using AlphaFold ( Jumper et al., 2021 30. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (16905) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggests the presence of distinct N- and C-terminal domains ( Figure S3 A). The C terminus of OspC3 is required for binding to Caspase 4/11 ( Kobayashi et al., 2013 31. Kobayashi, T. ∙ Ogawa, M. ∙ Sanada, T. ... The Shigella OspC3 effector inhibits caspase-4, antagonizes inflammatory cell death, and promotes epithelial infection Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13 :570-583 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2021 37. Li, Z. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Fu, J. ... Shigella evades pyroptosis by arginine ADP-riboxanation of caspase-11 Nature. 2021; 599 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that if cell death and IFN signaling inhibition are independent activities, distinct regions within OspC effectors may be required for these activities. By swapping N- and C-terminal regions of OspC3 and OspC2 ( Figure 2 A), the latter of which has limited IFNβ inhibitory activity in our reporter assay ( Figure 1 E), we mapped the region of OspC3 that is sufficient to prevent IFN signaling ( Figure 2 B). We found that chimeras A-D, which contain regions of the OspC2 N terminus and the OspC3 C terminus (shown in royal blue in 2B), were not able to block IFNβ signaling in our reporter assay. By contrast, chimeras E-H (shown in turquoise in 2B) that contained the N-terminal portion of OspC3 potently inhibited IFN signaling. Thus, the N-terminal region of OspC3 within amino acids (aa) 1–183 (as in chimera E) is required to restrict IFNβ activity.
To confirm these observations, we constructed 2 sets of truncation mutants. The first set (denoted N t ) contains the entire N-terminal domain of OspC1, OspC2, or OspC3 ( Figure S3 B), but lack the Caspase 4-binding region, shown to be essential for pyroptosis inhibition ( Ashida et al., 2020 4. Ashida, H. ∙ Sasakawa, C. ∙ Suzuki, T. A unique bacterial tactic to circumvent the cell death crosstalk induced by blockade of caspase-8 EMBO J. 2020; 39 :e104469 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2021 37. Li, Z. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Fu, J. ... Shigella evades pyroptosis by arginine ADP-riboxanation of caspase-11 Nature. 2021; 599 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). The second set (denoted C t ) contains most of each OspC protein, including the entire C-terminal domain, lacking only the putative IFN inhibitory motif identified in the chimera experiments ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S3 B). Only the N-terminal fragments of each OspC effector were able to block Tetherin expression following IFNβ treatment ( Figure 2 C).
The ability of OspC3 to block pyroptosis was recently demonstrated to be attributed to its ADP-riboxanation of Caspase 4, an enzymatic activity shared by other OspC effectors ( Li et al., 2021 37. Li, Z. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Fu, J. ... Shigella evades pyroptosis by arginine ADP-riboxanation of caspase-11 Nature. 2021; 599 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). In their study, Li and colleagues showed that this activity is dependent on several residues, including E326 and H328. Mutation of E326 and H328 to alanines (EH/AA) abrogates ADP-riboxanase activity, preventing OspC3 from modifying Caspase 4 and inhibiting pyroptosis ( Li et al., 2021 37. Li, Z. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Fu, J. ... Shigella evades pyroptosis by arginine ADP-riboxanation of caspase-11 Nature. 2021; 599 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated OspC1 and OspC3 alleles that harbor these EH/AA mutations. These enzymatically inactive proteins retained their ability to block the activation of ISRE ( Figure 2 D), as well as the induction of ISGs, as assessed by western immunoblotting against endogenous proteins in human ( Figure 2 E, quantification Figure S3 D) and mouse cells ( Figure S3 C). Finally, OspC3 EH/AA also blocked IFNβ-induced Tetherin expression ( Figure 2 F).
Next, we introduced chimera B ( Figure 2 A) into Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella . This chimera contains the OspC3 Caspase 4 binding site and all residues necessary for its ADP-riboxanation, but not the residues necessary for IFN inhibition ( Figure 2 B). As predicted, infection with the resulting strain Δ ospC1/C3 , pB led to minimal cell death, when compared with Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella after IFNβ or IFNγ treatment ( Figures S3 E–S3G). Importantly, this strain blocked cell death at least as efficiently as WT Shigella but was incapable of blocking IFNβ-mediated IFIT1 expression ( Figure 2 G, quantification Figure S3 H).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the C-terminal domain and ADP-riboxanase activity of OspC3, which are essential for Caspase 4 inhibition, are dispensable for its inhibition of IFN signaling and ISG expression. Therefore, these findings establish that OspC effectors inhibit cell death and IFN signaling by distinct biochemical mechanisms.
In an effort to identify additional candidate host binding partners of OspC effectors, full-length OspC1, OspC2, and OspC3 were each used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a cDNA fragment library generated from human macrophages activated with the Toll-like receptor 2 ligand Pam3CSK4 and IFNβ. Candidate interacting proteins were assigned a predicted biological score of A to F ( Formstecher et al., 2005 22. Formstecher, E. ∙ Aresta, S. ∙ Collura, V. ... Protein interaction mapping: a Drosophila case study Genome Res. 2005; 15 :376-384 Crossref Scopus (453) PubMed Google Scholar ), with A corresponding to a very high confidence in the interaction ( Figure S4 A). Between 60 and 100 million interactions were tested for each effector. For all three OspC effectors, over 150 clones were obtained, the vast majority of which contained a prey fragment encoding CALM (calmodulin, CaM) with a score of A ( Figures S4 B–S4D). As predicted ( Kobayashi et al., 2013 31. Kobayashi, T. ∙ Ogawa, M. ∙ Sanada, T. ... The Shigella OspC3 effector inhibits caspase-4, antagonizes inflammatory cell death, and promotes epithelial infection Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13 :570-583 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ), and as a validation of our screen, OspC3 was found to interact with Caspase 4 ( Figure S4 D).
CaM is a 17 kDa protein and a host Ca 2+ sensor ( Berchtold and Villalobo, 2014 7. Berchtold, M.W. ∙ Villalobo, A.

When bound to Ca 2+ , CaM adopts an open conformation facilitating its binding to, and activation of, a large number of downstream targets including calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). We determined whether OspC effectors interacted with Ca 2+ -bound or Ca 2+ -free (Apo−) CaM. Lysates of 293T cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins of interest were incubated with CaM-sepharose beads in buffer containing either CaCl 2 or the Ca 2+ chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), followed by elution in the opposite condition ( Figure 3 A). We observed no interactions in Ca 2+ -enriched conditions ( Figure 3 B, left half of blot). However, all three OspC effectors interacted with Apo-CaM ( Figure 3 B, right half of blot). Importantly, we detected interaction with the N-, but not the C-terminal fragments of each effector ( Figure 3 C). Additionally, OspC1 and OspC3 EH/AA mutants bound Apo-CaM as efficiently as their WT counterparts ( Figure 3 D). These data, along with our findings in Figures 2 B–2G, demonstrate that interaction with CaM and inhibition of IFN signaling occur via the N termini of OspC1 and OspC3 and independently of their cell death inhibitory activities.
We next used AlphaFold to model the OspC1-CaM complex. This led to a high-confidence model, with the two lobes of CaM wrapped around an α helix protruding from the OspC1 N-terminal domain ( Figures S5 A and S5B). This interaction is reminiscent of CaM binding to CaMKII, whereby the two lobes of CaM are similarly wrapped around a helix at the N terminus of CaMKII ( Figure S5 C). This suggests a model whereby OspC recruits and sequesters CaM in the absence of Ca 2+ , thus preventing its downstream activation of CaMKII.
We hypothesized that targeting of Apo-CaM by OspC1 and OspC3 might prevent CaM from binding and activating its signaling partners. When bound to Ca 2+ , CaM binds and activates CaMKII by inducing its autophosphorylation on T286. Cells expressing OspC effectors were treated with the Ca 2+ ionophore ionomycin for 30 s to increase CaMKII phosphorylation ( Figures 3 E and 3F). T286 phosphorylation was reduced upon expression of OspC1 or OspC3 but not OspC2 ( Figure 3 F). Importantly, ChikV NSP2, which blocks IFN signaling via a different mechanism ( Fros et al., 2010 24. Fros, J.J. ∙ Liu, W.J. ∙ Prow, N.A. ... Chikungunya virus nonstructural protein 2 inhibits type I/II interferon-stimulated JAK-STAT signaling J. Virol. 2010; 84 :10877-10887 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ), had no effect on CaMKII activation. pCaMKII binding to CaM was similarly inhibited by OspC1 or OspC3 but not OspC2 ( Figure 3 G). Moreover, although HeLa cells infected with WT Shigella exhibited little to no CaMKII phosphorylation, those infected with strains lacking either OspC1 or OspC3 demonstrated evidence of T286 phosphorylation that was further increased within cells infected with Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella ( Figure 3 H, quantification Figure S5 D). These data therefore establish that OspC1 and OspC3 synergize to block CaMKII activation.
IFNα or IFNγ signaling pathways were shown to be modulated by CaM and CaMKII in macrophages, but whether this is the case for IFNβ in epithelial cells had not been studied ( Nair et al., 2002 48. Nair, J.S. ∙ DaFonseca, C.J. ∙ Tjernberg, A. ... Requirement of Ca2+ and CaMKII for Stat1 Ser-727 phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :5971-5976 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2008 77. Wang, L. ∙ Tassiulas, I. ∙ Park-Min, K.H. ... Tuning” of type I interferon-induced Jak-STAT1 signaling by calcium-dependent kinases in macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :186-193 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings that N-terminal fragments of OspC1 and OspC3 both bind CaM and inhibit IFN suggested that these two phenotypes are linked. Thus, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of CaM would recapitulate the effects of OspC1 and OspC3 expression and block IFN signaling. First, 293T cells expressing an ISRE reporter were treated with inhibitors of CaM (W7), CaMKII (KN93), and its downstream signaling partner Pyk2 (Tyrphostin A9-TyrA9) ( Broeke et al., 2004 10. Broeke, R. Ten ∙ Leusink-Muis, T. ∙ Hilberdink, R. ... Specific modulation of calmodulin activity induces a dramatic production of superoxide by alveolar macrophages Lab.

Wang, M. ∙ Sun, H. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Functional activation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase2 (PYK2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus BMC Musculoskelet. Disord. 2009; 10 :141 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by stimulation with IFNβ ( Figures 4 A and 4B). In parallel, HeLa cells expressing a GAS reporter were treated with W7 and stimulated with IFNγ ( Figures 4 A and 4C). W7 blocked ISRE and GAS activation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Inhibition of CaMKII with KN93 or Pyk2 with TyrA9 blocked IFNβ signaling ( Figure 4 B). Second, genetic depletion of CaM ( Munk et al., 2020 47. Munk, M. ∙ Alcalde, J. ∙ Lorentzen, L. ... The impact of calmodulin on the cell cycle analyzed in a novel human cellular genetic system Cell Calcium. 2020; 88 :102207 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) reduced the ability of HeLa cells to induce ISGs following IFNβ treatment as assessed by immunoblotting for STAT1, IFIT1, or IFITM3 ( Figure 4 D, quantification Figure S5 E) and by monitoring the levels of ISG mRNAs via qRT-PCR ( Figure 4 E). Finally, the increase we observed in IFNβ-mediated IFIT1 expression following Δ ospC1/C3 or Δ ospC1/C3, pB infection was ablated in cells depleted for CaM ( Figure 4 F).
All IFNs signal via the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). As IFN-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation was shown to be blocked by inhibition of CaM signaling in primed macrophages ( Nair et al., 2002 48. Nair, J.S. ∙ DaFonseca, C.J. ∙ Tjernberg, A. ... Requirement of Ca2+ and CaMKII for Stat1 Ser-727 phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :5971-5976 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2008 77. Wang, L. ∙ Tassiulas, I. ∙ Park-Min, K.H. ... Tuning” of type I interferon-induced Jak-STAT1 signaling by calcium-dependent kinases in macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :186-193 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), we investigated whether CaM/CaMKII contributes to STAT1 phosphorylation in our experimental system ( Figures 4 A and 4G). W7, KN93, and TyrA9 all inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation. These data suggest that the CaM/CaMKII pathway modulates ISRE and ISG expression via phosphorylation of STAT1.
We therefore hypothesized that if OspC1 and OspC3 inhibited ISG expression by targeting CaM, they should block STAT1 phosphorylation. Expression of OspC1 and OspC3 completely abolished STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFNβ treatment ( Figures 4 H and S5 F). We also observed elevated IFNβ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in HeLa cells infected with strains lacking ospC1 , ospC3 , or both ( Figures 4 I and S5 G, quantification Figure S5 H).
Finally, we reasoned that if OspC1 and OspC3 block IFN signaling by preventing CaM from activating CaMKII, overexpression of active CaMKII along with these effectors might bypass their ability to block ISG expression. Thus, GFP- or GFP-tagged constitutively active CaMKII (T286D, T305/6A) ( Chang et al., 2019 14. Chang, J.Y. ∙ Nakahata, Y. ∙ Hayano, Y. ... Mechanisms of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II activation in single dendritic spines Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2784 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) expression plasmids were cotransfected with dsRed-OspC effector plasmids and our ISRE luciferase reporter ( Figures 4 J and 4K). Expression of active CaMKII increased IFN-mediated activation of ISRE by almost 10-fold, compared with GFP (compare gray and black bars in dsRed conditions; Figure 4 K). These data show that constitutively active CaMKII increases IFN signaling. We next tested whether active CaMKII can bypass the inhibitory effects of OspC1 and OspC3. When coexpressed with GFP, dsRed-tagged OspC1 or OspC3 inhibited IFNβ-mediated activation of ISRE 5-fold, whereas OspC2 was not inhibitory ( Figure 4 K, gray bars). However, in the presence of active GFP-CaMKII, OspC1 and OspC3 were no longer able to significantly block ISRE activation ( Figure 4 K, black bars). This is in contrast with NSP2 that blocked IFN signaling almost equally in the presence or absence of active CaMKII. Taken together, these data demonstrate that OspC1 and OspC3 target the CaM/CaMKII pathway to block STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression ( Figure S5 I).
We sought to determine if OspC effectors were limited to Shigella spp . or whether they were conserved across multiple pathogens. A BLASTp query of the OspC3 amino acid sequence in the NCBI database revealed several homologs distributed across Proteobacteria . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the most likely recent common ancestral sequences included plant-associated opportunistic human pathogens ( Figure 5 A). Furthermore, the Shigella OspC3 sequence was rooted in a clade consisting of homologs from the major human pathogens Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) ( Pasqua et al., 2017 55. Pasqua, M. ∙ Michelacci, V. ∙ Di Martino, M.L. ... The intriguing evolutionary journey of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) toward pathogenicity Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8 :2390 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Salmonella enterica ( Figueira et al., 2013 21. Figueira, R. ∙ Watson, K.G. ∙ Holden, D.W. ... Identification of Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 type III secretion system effectors involved in intramacrophage replication of S. enterica serovar typhimurium: implications for rational vaccine design mBio. 2013; 4 :e00065 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), in addition to the emerging pathogens Enterobacter hormaechei ( Wenger et al., 1997 80. Wenger, P.N. ∙ Tokars, J.I. ∙ Brennan, P. ... An outbreak of Enterobacter hormaechei infection and colonization in an intensive care nursery Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24 :1243-1244 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Escherichia albertii ( Ooka et al., 2012 54. Ooka, T. ∙ Seto, K. ∙ Kawano, K. ... Clinical significance of Escherichia albertii Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2012; 18 :488-492 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 A). BLAST analysis confirmed that all strains contained components of T3SSs, and further interrogation of the homologs amino acid sequences with PREFFECTOR demonstrated that all contained signatures of putative effector proteins, indicating their propensity for secretion ( Figure S6 ).
Comparison of representative OspC homologs with the Shigella OspC sequence revealed high degrees of similarity in the N-terminal domain and, to a lesser extent, the C-terminal domain ( Figures 5 B and 5C). We thus hypothesized that these OspC homologs might bind CaM and block IFN signaling. To verify this, representative effectors from across the phylogeny were expressed in 293T cells and lysates were subjected to pulldowns with CaM beads. We found that almost all effectors were able to bind Apo-CaM ( Figure 5 D). A notable exception was the S. enterica protein that harbored a large insertion relative to other effectors, potentially altering CaM binding. Moreover, functional analysis revealed that proteins from bacteria which are not frequently associated with human or animal infections, did not block ISRE activation ( Figure 5 E, gray bars). However, homologs from pathogenic EIEC, E. hormaechei , and E. albertii blocked ISRE activation to levels consistent with Shigella OspC3 ( Figure 5 E, blue bars). This indicates that these OspC-like effectors may represent previously unrecognized virulence determinants. More importantly, these data show that CaM binding and subsequent inhibition of IFN by OspC effectors is a virulence strategy conserved across multiple bacterial pathogens.
Our data show that the highly conserved Shigella OspC family of effectors inhibits signaling downstream of type I and III IFNs. Evolution of such countermeasures suggests these IFNs impose a significant selection pressure against intracellular bacteria. We thus compared the growth of Shigella within epithelial cells in the presence and absence of IFNs via enumeration of intracellular bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) using gentamicin protection assays. Pretreatment of HeLa cells with IFNβ slightly inhibited the replication of intracellular WT Shigella sonnei ( Figures S7 A and S7B). Growth of Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella was moderately attenuated under control conditions and completely inhibited in the presence of IFNβ ( Figure S7 B).
To determine the sensitivity of Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella to additional IFNs, we made use of T84 colonic epithelial cells (T84wt), which are responsive to all 3 IFN families ( Pervolaraki et al., 2019 58. Pervolaraki, K. ∙ Guo, C. ∙ Albrecht, D. ... Type-specific crosstalk modulates interferon signaling in intestinal epithelial cells J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2019; 39 :650-660 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were infected with WT or Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella . IFNβ, IFNλ1, or IFNγ was added 30 min postinvasion, allowing enough time for effector secretion and binding of OspCs to their host cell targets ( Figures 6 A–6D). Although each IFN treatment lowered WT Shigella replication, Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella were entirely unable to replicate in the presence of IFN ( Figures 6 B–6D).
OspC1 and OspC3 block the activities of Caspase 3/7 and Caspase 4/11, respectively. To investigate whether cell death induced by these Caspases plays a role in the observed IFN-mediated restriction of intracellular bacterial replication, we pretreated T84 cells with the broad-spectrum Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and the necroptosis inhibitor, necrosulfonamide ( Figures S7 C and S7D). The growth of Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella was only partially restored in the presence of these inhibitors. This finding shows that the defect in growth of the mutant is partially due to its inability to block cell death, confirming previous reports ( Ashida et al., 2020 4. Ashida, H. ∙ Sasakawa, C. ∙ Suzuki, T. A unique bacterial tactic to circumvent the cell death crosstalk induced by blockade of caspase-8 EMBO J. 2020; 39 :e104469 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wandel et al., 2020 76. Wandel, M.P. ∙ Kim, B.H. ∙ Park, E.S. ... Guanylate-binding proteins convert cytosolic bacteria into caspase-4 signaling platforms Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :880-891 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in the presence of these drugs, the intracellular growth of Δ ospC1/C3 was still significantly restricted, and IFNs significantly further lowered bacterial numbers ( Figure S7 D). Similarly, the growth in HeLa cells of Δ ospC1/C3 , pB Shigella that cannot block ISG expression ( Figures 2 G, 4 F, and S3 H) but can block host cell death ( Figures S3 E–S3G), was inhibited by IFNβ or IFNγ ( Figure S7 E) to levels undistinguishable from Δ ospC1/C3 bacteria. These data demonstrate that IFN-mediated restriction of Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella replication is, in part, independent of host cell death.
Growth of Δ ospC1/C3 in T84 cells was very limited in the absence of exogenous IFN, leading us to speculate that this growth inhibition is due to the activity of endogenously produced IFN. Therefore, we compared the replication of Shigella strains in WT T84 cells (T84wt) or cells lacking either the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR KO), the IFNλ receptor (IFNLR KO), or IFNAR and IFNLR double knockout (IFNR dKO) ( Figures 6 A, 6E–6G, and S7 F). In T84wt cells, Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella replicated to significantly lower levels than WT bacteria ( Figures 6 E–6G, black stars). However, in IFNR dKO cells, Δ ospC1/C3 bacteria were no longer replication defective compared with WT bacteria (p = 0.4) and replicated an order of magnitude more efficiently than in WT cells (purple stars). IFNAR ( Figure 6 F) or IFNLR KO cells ( Figure 6 G) displayed comparable phenotypes, with IFNLR deletion having the strongest effect.
Although S. sonnei causes limited disease pathology when administered orally to mice, it is able to colonize the intestines of mice pretreated with streptomycin ( Anderson et al., 2017 3. Anderson, M.C. ∙ Vonaesch, P. ∙ Saffarian, A. ... Shigella sonnei encodes a functional T6SS used for interbacterial competition and niche occupancy Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 21 :769-776.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we orally inoculated WT C57BL/6J mice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), streptomycin-resistant WT, or Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella for 24 h ( Figure 7 A). Consistent with previous observations ( Anderson et al., 2017 3. Anderson, M.C. ∙ Vonaesch, P. ∙ Saffarian, A. ... Shigella sonnei encodes a functional T6SS used for interbacterial competition and niche occupancy Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 21 :769-776.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Singer and Sansonetti, 2004 68. Singer, M. ∙ Sansonetti, P.J. IL-8 is a key chemokine regulating neutrophil recruitment in a new mouse model of Shigella -induced colitis J. Immunol. 2004; 173 :4197-4206 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ), colon length and inflammation were similar to uninfected animals ( Figures S8 A and S8B). Pathological scores revealed very minor epithelial damage and goblet cell loss in infected mice compared with uninfected ( Figure S8 B). After gentamicin treatment to clear extracellular organisms, bacterial CFUs were plated to quantify intracellular bacterial burdens. Bacterial titers in the colon of WT-infected mice were significantly higher than those of Δ ospC1/C3 -infected colons ( Figure 7 B). CFUs in the cecum showed the same trend ( Figure 7 C) with almost a log difference between the two strains, although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0578).
We next sought to determine whether CaMKII phosphorylation and ISG expression was increased in mice infected with Δ ospC1/C3 bacteria. At 24 h postinfection, comparable phosphorylation of CaMKII was found in the colons of uninfected and WT Shigella -infected mice, whereas those of mice infected with the Δ ospC1/C3 strain exhibited significant higher levels of pCaMKII ( Figures S8 C and S8D), suggesting that the lack of OspC1 and OspC3 increases CaMKII phosphorylation in mouse colonic cells. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that WT Shigella infection induced a small but nonsignificant expression of multiple ISGs ( Cxcl10 , Viperin , and Ifit1 ) in the colon compared with uninfected organs ( Figure 7 D). Conversely, infection with the Δ ospC1/C3 strain induced a significant increase in expression of these 3 ISGs in the colon compared with uninfected animals ( Figure 7 D). Moreover, Cxcl10 expression was significantly increased in mice infected with Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella , compared with WT Shigella , despite the lower bacterial titers observed in the Δ ospC1/C3 infection. Together these data demonstrate that OspC1 and OspC3 predispose Shigella to efficient infection of the tissue, an observation that correlates with increased expression of antibacterial ISGs in Δ ospC1/C3 -infected animals.
The role of IFNs in bacterial infection is complex. Notably, type I IFNs are either protective or detrimental to the host depending on the bacterial species and disease model ( Boxx and Cheng, 2016 9. Boxx, G.M. ∙ Cheng, G. The roles of type I interferon in bacterial infection Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :760-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peignier and Parker, 2021 56. Peignier, A. ∙ Parker, D. Impact of Type I interferons on susceptibility to bacterial pathogens Trends Microbiol. 2021; 29 :823-835 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, we deciphered the role of type I IFNs in anti- Shigella immunity by infecting WT and Ifnar −/− mice with WT and Δ ospC1/C3 S. sonnei . The colonization defect of Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella in the colon and cecum of WT mice was rescued in the Ifnar −/− background ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Similarly, although Δ ospC1/C3 displayed reduced dissemination to the spleen of WT mice, this deficiency was rescued in Ifnar −/− mice ( Figure 7 G). Together, these data highlight the crucial role that IFNs play in intestinal defense against Shigella . In response, OspC effectors are indispensable for Shigella to subvert host responses and colonize the murine gut.

Section: Discussion

The functions of type I and III IFNs in antibacterial immunity remain poorly understood. Depending on the pathogen and route of infection, type I IFNs have been shown to be protective or detrimental to hosts infected with bacteria ( Alphonse et al., 2021 1. Alphonse, N. ∙ Dickenson, R.E. ∙ Odendall, C. Interferons: tug of war between bacteria and their host Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2021; 11 :624094 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Boxx and Cheng, 2016 9. Boxx, G.M. ∙ Cheng, G. The roles of type I interferon in bacterial infection Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :760-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peignier and Parker, 2021 56. Peignier, A. ∙ Parker, D. Impact of Type I interferons on susceptibility to bacterial pathogens Trends Microbiol. 2021; 29 :823-835 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously showed that type III IFNs protect epithelial barriers against invasive bacteria ( Odendall et al., 2017 52. Odendall, C. ∙ Voak, A.A. ∙ Kagan, J.C. Type III interferons are commonly induced by bacteria-sensing TLRs, and reinforce epithelial barriers during infection J. Immunol. 2017; 176 :139-148 Google Scholar ), but the mechanisms by which type III IFNs afford protection remain unknown. Here, we find that both type I and III IFNs restrict S. sonnei infection of epithelial cells. Most importantly, our data reveal a role for type I IFN in protecting against Shigella colonization in a mouse model of infection.
The importance of type I and III IFNs in immunity against bacteria is underlined by our discovery that Shigella blocks IFN signaling and ISG expression. Our multilayered approach encompassing global and targeted techniques revealed that Shigella utilizes the OspC family of effectors as potent inhibitors of the host IFN response. Although most viruses possess at least one virulence factor that blocks signaling downstream of IFN receptors, our study reports identification of bacterial effectors that inhibit JAK/STAT and IFN signaling and ISG expression. Our findings establish both the importance of IFN inhibition in bacterial pathogenesis and re-enforce the role of this family of cytokines in antibacterial immunity.
Regulation of IFN signaling is multifaceted, involving the coordinated activity of multiple host proteins ( Stanifer et al., 2019 71. Stanifer, M.L. ∙ Pervolaraki, K. ∙ Boulant, S. Differential regulation of type I and type III interferon signaling Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar ). In this study, we demonstrate a previously undescribed mechanism by which OspC1 and OspC3 block IFN signaling through their interaction with the ubiquitous Ca 2+ sensor CaM, preventing it from binding and activating its key target CaMKII. Intriguingly, although we detected a very clear interaction between OspC2 and Apo-CaM, OspC2 did not block CaMKII phosphorylation. Future structural determination of Apo-CaM/OspC complexes will decipher the molecular determinants of CaM inhibition by OspC1 and OspC3 and shed light into OspC2’s divergent activity. Furthermore, inhibition of CaMKII by OspC1 and OspC3 blocked STAT1 phosphorylation, a phenotype that was phenocopied by pharmacological inhibition of CaM/CaMKII. Our data confirm a previously described ( Nair et al., 2002 48. Nair, J.S. ∙ DaFonseca, C.J. ∙ Tjernberg, A. ... Requirement of Ca2+ and CaMKII for Stat1 Ser-727 phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :5971-5976 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2008 77. Wang, L. ∙ Tassiulas, I. ∙ Park-Min, K.H. ... Tuning” of type I interferon-induced Jak-STAT1 signaling by calcium-dependent kinases in macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :186-193 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ) but underappreciated role of the Ca 2+ /CaM/CaMKII axis in modulating IFN signaling and ISG expression, highlighting the importance of this pathway in controlling bacterial infections.
OspC1 and OspC3 bind CaM and inhibit IFN via their N-terminal domain, independently of the residues and biochemical activity that mediate inhibition of cell death. These data not only reinforce the link between CaM targeting and IFN signaling inhibition but also demonstrate that OspC3 (and presumably OspC1) has at least two genetically and spatially separable functions. Other bacterial effectors have been attributed multiple functions, but our study highlights a rare example of multifunctional effectors with discrete molecular domains that mediate binding to distinct targets, as well as targeting of distinct host cell processes. These findings highlight the pleiotropic and pivotal role of OspC1 and OspC3 in Shigella pathogenesis.
Our data also revealed the presence of OspC-like effectors in diverse species of bacteria. Fascinatingly, although CaM binding is an ancestral trait of most OspC homologs tested, inhibition of IFN responses was restricted to the pathogens EIEC, E. albertii , and E. hormaechei . This not only demonstrates that inhibition of Ca 2+ , and by extension IFN signaling, is a widespread virulence strategy but that the ability to inhibit IFN may be a trait evolved in response to selection for immune evasion. Evidence is emerging that different OspC family members may leverage CaM binding for distinct functions. Indeed, Chromobacterium violaceum CopC, an OspC homolog, was recently shown to hijack CaM, using it as a cofactor to enable its enzymatic activity ( Peng et al., 2022 57. Peng, T. ∙ Tao, X. ∙ Xia, Z. ... Pathogen hijacks programmed cell death signaling by arginine ADPR-deacylization of caspases Mol.

Calmodulin Binding Activates Chromobacterium CopC Effector to ADP-Riboxanate Host Apoptotic Caspases mBio. 2022; 0069022 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ), similarly to Bordetella CyaA ( Guo et al., 2005 28.

Protein polyglutamylation catalyzed by the bacterial calmodulin-dependent pseudokinase SidJ eLife. 2019; 8 :e51162 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although CopC possesses the same ADP-riboxanase activity as Shigella OspCs, it is unable to inactivate Caspases in the absence of CaM ( Peng et al., 2022 57. Peng, T. ∙ Tao, X. ∙ Xia, Z. ... Pathogen hijacks programmed cell death signaling by arginine ADPR-deacylization of caspases Mol. Cell. 2022; 82 :1-15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). OspC3 modifies Caspase 4 when both proteins are expressed in bacteria, in the absence of any eukaryotic protein ( Li et al., 2021 37. Li, Z. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Fu, J. ... Shigella evades pyroptosis by arginine ADP-riboxanation of caspase-11 Nature. 2021; 599 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, whether CaM is a Shigella OspC cofactor remains unclear. Our findings that OspC1 and OspC3 block CaMKII phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo argue that these bacterial effectors do inhibit CaM to target innate responses. These findings place CaM as a key molecular target for virulence factors conserved across multiple bacterial taxa, both by hijacking it to enable their function and by blocking its downstream targets, including those regulating innate immunity. The work presented in this study mandates further research into the roles of Ca 2+ and CaM at the host-pathogen interface.
This study examined the molecular basis for inhibition of IFN signaling, by a single family of homologous effector proteins. Future studies should investigate the combined activities of the multiple IFN inhibitory effector proteins identified in our IFN inhibitor screen under infection conditions. Further, although we demonstrate that deletion of OspC1 and OspC3 from Shigella renders them deficient in colonization of the murine intestine in WT mice, neither these mice nor the Ifnar −/− mice displayed pathological signs of Shigella infection. Future studies utilizing NLRC4-deficient mice—a model of murine shigellosis ( Mitchell et al., 2020 45. Mitchell, P.S. ∙ Roncaioli, J.L. ∙ Turcotte, E.A. ... NAIP–NLRC4-deficient mice are susceptible to shigellosis eLife. 2020; 9 :e59022 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar )—will decipher the role of OspC effectors and by extension IFN signaling in Shigella pathogenesis. Finally, although AlphaFold predictions formed a conceptual framework for this study, future work should experimentally resolve the structure of the CaM-OspC complex.

Prior to use, cells were cultured in 1 μg/mL Doxycycline (Sigma) for 72 hrs to induce CaM depletion.
Unless stated otherwise, when indicated, cells were treated with 10 ng/mL of human IFNβ, λ1 or γ (Peprotech), 1.6-1000 U/m of human IFNα (Pbl Assay Science) or 1000 U/mL of mouse IFNβ. The following drugs were used and unless otherwise stated were applied to cells 30 mins prior to infection until the experimental endpoint; Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketon (Z-VAD-FMK) (25 μM, Apexbio), Necrosulfonamide (20 μM, Tocris), W7 (CaM inhibitor, 2.5-20 μM, Calbiochem), KN93 (CaMKII inhibitor, 2.5-20 μM, MedChemExpress), TyrA9 (Pyk2 inhibitor, 0.625-5 μM, Calbiochem).
This study utilized Shigella sonnei strain 53G and its isogenic deletion mutants for ospC1, ospC3 , and mxiD . All bacterial strains used and generated in this study are outlined in the key resources table . In frame deletion mutants were generated using the lambda red recombination system as previously described ( Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 15. Datsenko, K.A. ∙ Wanner, B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :6640-6645 Crossref Scopus (12007) PubMed Google Scholar ), using primers outlined in the key resources table . Plasmids were transformed into competent Shigella strains by electroporation using a Biorad Micropulser. All Shigella strains were grown in trypticase soy broth (TSB, Sigma) at 37°C with 200 rpm shaking, unless otherwise stated. Antibiotics used for selection were as follows; ampicillin (100 ug/mL), kanamycin (50 ug/mL), chloramphenicol (25 ug/mL) and streptomycin (100 ug/mL). MOIs are indicated on each figure legend. For experiments using the Δ ospC1/C3 Shigella complimented with the pB OspC3/2 chimera (Δ ospC1/C3, pB ), strains were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) lacking glucose to alleviate repression of the lac promoter. Growth in culture medium and invasion of Hela and T84 cells was determined for all recombinant Shigella strains prior to use in this study ( Figures S8 E–S8G).
Oral murine infections were performed in male and female 6-16-week-old C57BL/6J and Ifnar1 −/− mice. All animals used in this study were handled in accordance with the Home Office, UK project license P292BBCE, under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Procedures and experiments were approved by the King’s College London animal ethic committee. C57/BL/6J mice were either obtained from Charles River or bred at the King’s College facility under pathogen-free condition. Ifnar1 −/− mice were bred at the King’s College facility under pathogen-free condition. Groups of 4-6 mice were randomly allocated and maintained in a 7am-7pm light cycle, according to standard husbandry practices at the Kings College London Biological Safety Unit. During experiments, female C57BL/6J and Ifnar1 −/− mice were co-housed in the same cage. Mice starved for 3 hrs were orally gavaged with 200 μL of 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulphate (20 mg/mouse) and placed in a cage with fresh bedding. 24 hrs later, mice were again starved for 3 hrs before being orally gavaged with 10 9 -10 10 CFU of log-phase, streptomycin resistant WT or ΔospC1/C3 S. sonnei 53G, resuspended in 400 μL PBS. Mouse weights and sign of diseases were recorded at regular intervals. Mice were culled, and aseptically removed and processed post-mortem. Infection inputs were verified by serially diluting a fraction of the initial inoculum and plating on TSB plates containing 0.01% Congo red (CR) and 100μg/mL streptomycin.
Each effector mammalian expression plasmid was constructed using the Gateway™ recombination system (Invitrogen). Entry plasmids for the full-length effectors were generated as previously described ( Schmitz et al., 2009 65. Schmitz, A.M. ∙ Morrison, M.F. ∙ Agunwamba, A.O. ... Protein interaction platforms: visualization of interacting proteins in yeast Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :500-502 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Entry plasmids for the OspC2/OspC3 chimeras were generated via sewing overlap PCR using oligomers described in the key resources table . Genes encoding the chimeras were introduced into pDNR221 and sequence verified. The full length and chimeric effector genes were transferred into gateway compatible variants of pEGFP-C1 and pDsRed-monomer-C1 (Clontech). These Gateway compatible variants were generated by introducing a Gateway cassette into the SmaI restriction site in the polylinker of each parent vector. Additional transfection vectors expressing OspC homologs from Citrobacter amalonaticus , Burkholderia ubonensis , Cedecea spp. , Morganella morganii , Escherichia albertii , Enterobacter hormaechei , Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and Salmonella enterica , in addition to catalytically inactive Shigella OspC EH/AA in the pEGFP-C1 background were synthesized by Biobasic (Canada).
All transfection plasmids used in this study are outlined in the key resources table . Cells were transfected using jetPRIME (Polyplus) or PEI (PolySciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Successful transfection was monitored by way of GFP fluorescence using a Floid Cell Imaging Station (Life Technologies).
HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of 2x10 5 cells/mL and were transfected as above with the pGL4.45 ISRE-Luc reporter plasmids and incubated overnight (O/N). Where indicated, a Renilla internal control was used to account for changes in cell viability. Alternatively, 293T-ISRE luciferase cells were used. The following day, cells were treated O/N with IFNs for 18 hrs at the indicated concentrations before lysis in Lysis buffer (3.3g Gly-Gly, 1.8g MgSO 4 anhydrous, 1.52g EGTA tetrasodium, 2.5mL Triton-100X, pH 7.8) + BrightGlo (Promega) containing the luciferin substrate for the reaction. If using Renilla, a dual Firefly/Renilla assay kit was used (Promega), following the manufacturers recommendation. Samples were transferred to white flat bottom plates (Biovision), and luminescence was read using a PerkinElmer 2030 VICTOR X Light plate reader.
Cells were seeded at 2x10 5 cells/mL in antibiotic-free complete medium. Where indicated, cells were treated with IFNs or drugs once they had adhered to the well. The following day, cells were starved in antibiotic free medium with 1% FBS for 2 hrs, before challenge with logarithmic phase (OD 600 = 0.8-1.0) bacteria at the indicated multiplicity of infection for 30-45 mins at 37°C. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and placed in medium containing 10% FBS supplemented with 100 μg/mL of gentamicin and incubated for another 30 mins (1 h post infection) to 4.5 hrs (5 hrs post infection) at 37°C. At the respective time points, cells were washed and lysed in PBS (Thermo Fisher) containing 1% Triton100X (ChemCruz). Lysates were serially diluted, and plated onto agar plates and the number of internalized bacteria was determined by counting the colony-forming units after O/N incubation at 37°C.
Protein extraction was performed using modified Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 nM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 250 mM NaCl) supplemented with phosphatase-phostop (Roche) and Halt Protease inhibitor (Nalgene). Electrophoresis was carried out on TGX gels (Biorad) using 1X Tris-Glycine running buffer. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using BioRad Transfer Blot turbo system. Membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody incubations were carried out either O/N at 4°C or for 2 hr at RT. Secondary antibody incubations were carried out for 1 hr at RT after 3x 5 mins washes in TBST. Blots were developed with Pierce™ ECL Plus western Blotting substrate, and detected on AMERSHAM ImageQuant 800 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) or Odyssey (LI-COR). All primary and secondary antibodies used in this study are shown in the key resources table . Western blotting data were quantified using the ImageJ densitometry function comparing the protein of interest to loading control bands as previously described ( Schindelin et al., 2012 64. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40001) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cells were lysed in RLT Lysis buffer (Qiagen 1015762) supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol. RNA was then isolated using RNA Mini Kit columns (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. qRT-PCR was carried out using TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1-step kit (Applied Biosystems cat. 4392938) on the QuantStudio 5 (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized against the expression of a control gene (GAPDH) followed by the untreated sample using the ΔΔCt method. When no counts were detected in a sample, an arbitrary number of 45 cycles was selected. All probes used in this study are shown in key resources table .
Cells were washed and detached from the tissue culture plate by incubating in TrypLE Dissociation Reagent (Gibco) for 5 mins at 37°C, transferred to 1.5mL conical tubes, pelleted by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 mins at 4°C, stained in 100μl of APC-anti-CD317 antibody for 20 mins at RT and 1mL of Live/Dead dye (Invitrogen L34976A) for another 30 mins at RT, washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (1%BSA+0.1%sodium azide in DPBS). Samples were run on the FACS Aria (BD) flow cytometer equipped with the 488nm and 635nm lasers. Data were analyzed with FlowJo Software.
RNA from HEK293T cells was extracted as above. Sequencing was performed on the NovaSeq platform and typically generated ∼25 million bp reads per sample. The nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (version 3.5; Ewels et al., 2020 20. Ewels, P.A. ∙ Peltzer, A. ∙ Fillinger, S. ... The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :276-278 Crossref Scopus (780) PubMed Google Scholar ) written in the Nextflow domain specific language (version 19.10.0; Di Tommaso et al., 2017 18. Di Tommaso, P. ∙ Chatzou, M. ∙ Floden, E.W. ... Nextflow enables reproducible computational workflows Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :316-319 Crossref Scopus (1326) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to perform the primary analysis of the samples in conjunction with Singularity (version 2.6.0; Kurtzer et al., 2017 32. Kurtzer, G.M. ∙ Sochat, V. ∙ Bauer, M.W. Singularity: scientific containers for mobility of compute PLoS One. 2017; 12 :e0177459 Crossref Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ). All data was processed relative to the human GRCh38 genome downloaded from Ensembl (release 95). Gene counts per gene per sample were obtained using the RSEM-STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 19. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27072) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li and Dewey, 2011 36. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13975) PubMed Google Scholar ) option of the pipeline and they were imported on DESeq (v1.28.0; Love et al., 2014 39. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48468) PubMed Google Scholar ) within R environment v4.0.3 for differential expression analysis. Gene Set Enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out using R package Cluster Profiler (v3.18.1; Yu et al., 2012 82. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... ClusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (18530) PubMed Google Scholar ) and gene lists ranked using the Wald statistic. Pre-ranked analyses were carried out using Hallmark pathway gene sets from the Molecular Signatures database (MSigDB, v7.2). Gene signatures were considered significant if FDR q-value ≤ 0.05.
5x10 6 293T cells expressing GFP tagged proteins of interest were washed in cold TBS and lysed in 400 μl 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail (Halt), pH 7.4 supplemented with either 2 mM CaCl 2 or 2 mM EDTA, to identify whether proteins interact with Ca 2+ -bound CaM or Ca 2+ -free (Apo-) CaM respectively. Cleared lysates were then incubated with 30 μl Calmodulin beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 hrs or O/N, rotating end over end at 4°C. Beads were spun down and washed in Lysis buffer 6 times. Elution was carried out in Lysis buffer supplemented in either 10 mM EDTA or 10 mM CaCl 2 (at the opposite condition used for lysis) at RT for 30 mins with gentle shaking. In these conditions, a protein that interacts with Apo-CaM binds in the presence of EDTA and is released by the addition of CaCl 2 and vice versa . Elutes were then resuspended in 4X sample buffer. Lysates and pulldown fractions were run on SDS-PAGE as described above the presence of GFP-tagged proteins in the elutes was analyzed with an anti-GFP antibody (see key resources table ).
Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed by Hybrigenics Services, S.A.S., Evry, France ( http://www.hybrigenics-services.com ).
The coding sequences for S. flexneri OspC1 (aa 1-477), OspC2 and OspC3 (aa 1-484) were PCR-amplified and cloned into pB27 as a C-terminal fusion to LexA (LexA-OspC1-3). The construct was checked by sequencing the entire insert and used as a bait to screen a cDNA library of human macrophages stimulated by Pam3CSK4 or IFNβ constructed into pP6. pB27 and pP6 derive from the original pBTM116 ( Vojtek and Hollenberg, 1995 75. Vojtek, A.B. ∙ Hollenberg, S.M. Ras-Raf interaction: two-hybrid analysis Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255 :331-342 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pGADGH ( Bartel et al, 1993 6. Bartel, P.L. ∙ Chien, C.T. ∙ Sternglanz, R. ... Using the two-hybrid system to detect protein–protein interactions Hartley, D.A. (Editor) Cellular interactions in development: A practical approach Oxford University Press, 1993; 153-179 Crossref Google Scholar ) plasmids, respectively.
In the case of OspC3, 65 million clones (5-fold the complexity of the library) were screened using a mating approach with YHGX13 (Y187 ade2-101::loxP-kanMX-loxP, matα) and L40ΔGal4 (mata) yeast strains as previously described ( Fromont-Racine et al., 1997 23. Fromont-Racine, M. ∙ Rain, J.C. ∙ Legrain, P. Toward a functional analysis of the yeast genome through exhaustive two-hybrid screens Nat. Genet. 1997; 16 :277-282 Crossref Scopus (733) PubMed Google Scholar ). 280 His+ colonies were selected on a medium lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine. The prey fragments of the positive clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced at their 5’ and 3’ junctions. The resulting sequences were used to identify the corresponding interacting proteins in the GenBank database (NCBI) using a fully automated procedure. A confidence Predicted Biological Score was attributed to each interaction as previously described ( Formstecher et al., 2005 22. Formstecher, E. ∙ Aresta, S. ∙ Collura, V. ... Protein interaction mapping: a Drosophila case study Genome Res. 2005; 15 :376-384 Crossref Scopus (453) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Post-mortem, ceca and colons were harvested, flushed with cold PBS and cut longitudinally in 3 pieces. One piece was placed in gentamicin (400 μg/mL) for 30 mins, washed 5x and homogenized in 1% Triton X-100 for enumeration of CFU. The other sections were either homogenized in 1mL Trizol (Invitrogen cat. 15596026) as above for RNA extraction or fixed for histology purposes. Post-mortem spleens were homogenized in 1% Triton X-100 for enumeration of CFU. For CFU determination, serial dilutions were made in PBS and plated on TSB plates containing 0.01% CR and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. RNA extraction was carried out following Invitrogen user guide. For protein extraction, cells were lysed in 1%Triton X-100 and protein concentration were determined by Bradford assay. Colon length was calculating using Fiji software.
Day 1 post infection, colons were isolated, flushed, cut longitudinally, fixed in 10% neutral formalin for 24 hrs prior to be transferred in 70% ethanol. Samples were processed by the Crick histology platform following routine histologic methods. In brief, tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 3-5 μm thickness on a rotary microtome, and mounted on glass slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and coverslipped. Histopathological scoring of the organs was performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (SLP) who was blinded to the experimental groups at the time of the evaluation.
Cell death was quantified by measuring LDH release to the supernatant. To measure LDH, LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (Thermo Scientific) was used, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To normalize for spontaneous cell lysis, the percentage of cell death was calculated as follows: (LDHsample – LDHnegative control)/ (LDHpositive control – LDHnegative control) × 100. Cell death was also analyzed by the uptake of propidium iodide (PI). Briefly, prior to infection, cells were incubated for 30 minutes with complete medium supplemented with 5 μg/mL PI (Thermo Scientific). Fluorescence was measured at 630 nm every hour with a Polarstar Omega plate reader at the indicated time points. Data were expressed as the % of fluorescence signal from cells lysed with a final concentration of 0.05% Triton-X100. Lastly, cell viability was determined using the CellTiterGlo luminescence detection assay (Promega) which quantifies intracellular ATP levels, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
To identify OspC homologs in other bacterial species, the Shigella flexneri OspC3 amino acid sequence was subject to BLASTp ( Altschul et al., 1990 2. Altschul, S.F. ∙ Gish, W. ∙ Miller, W. ... Basic local alignment search tool J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215 :403-410 Crossref Scopus (76852) PubMed Google Scholar ) analysis against the entire NCBI database excluding the Shigella taxid using default parameters. FASTA files for the top 100 most similar proteins were extracted, and aligned with Clustal Omega ( Sievers and Higgins, 2018 67. Sievers, F. ∙ Higgins, D.G. Clustal Omega for making accurate alignments of many protein sequences Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :135-145 Crossref Scopus (1088) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sequence alignment was used to generate a phylogenetic tree in Interactive Tree of Life (iTol) ( Letunic and Bork, 2021 35. Letunic, I. ∙ Bork, P. Interactive tree of life (iTOL) v3: an online tool for the display and annotation Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :W293-W296 Crossref Scopus (4832) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the maximum likelihood algorithm. For presentation, the tree was pruned to contain only a single sequence per genus in each individual clade of the tree. Amino acid sequences of the identified proteins were further analyzed with PREFFECTOR ( Dhroso et al., 2018 17. Dhroso, A. ∙ Eidson, S. ∙ Korkin, D. Genome-wide prediction of bacterial effector candidates across six secretion system types using a feature-based statistical framework Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :17209 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) to predict their propensity to be T3SS effectors. For prediction of potential secondary structures, amino acid sequences were queried using PSIPRED ( Buchan and Jones, 2019 11. Buchan, D.W.A. ∙ Jones, D.T. The PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench: 20 years on Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W402-W407 Crossref Scopus (872) PubMed Google Scholar ; McGuffin et al., 2000 43. McGuffin, L.J. ∙ Bryson, K. ∙ Jones, D.T. The PSIPRED protein structure prediction server Bioinformatics. 2000; 16 :404-405 Crossref Scopus (3010) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting.PDB file was used to annotate sequence alignments using ESPript ( Gouet et al., 2003 27. Gouet, P. ∙ Robert, X. ∙ Courcelle, E. ESPript/ENDscript: extracting and rendering sequence and 3D information from atomic structures of proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :3320-3323 Crossref Scopus (1158) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The atomic model of OspC1 was generated with AlphaFold ( Jumper et al., 2021 30. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (16905) PubMed Google Scholar ), with default parameters. The structure of the OspC1-CaM complex was modelled using AlphaFold-Multimer. For this, an initial model was generated using the full-length protein sequences of both OspC1 and CaM. This led to a set of models where CaM was consistently binding around helix 1; however, for some of them, the confidence score was low. Upon inspection of the models, it became apparent that this was because in some of them, either the intrinsically-disordered N-terminus, or the C-terminal domain, was clashing with the putative position of CaM. We therefore performed a second modelling experiment, using only the N-terminal domain of OspC1. This led to a set of highly-similar, high-confidence models of the complex, supporting the reported binding mode. All structural figures were generated in ChimeraX.
Data are shown as the means ± SEM. All statistical comparisons were performed using Prism 8 or 9 (GraphPad). Figure legends indicate the specific statistical tests used for each experiment. Statistical significance was considered as P<0.05.
