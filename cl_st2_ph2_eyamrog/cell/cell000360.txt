Title: TOP1 inhibition therapy protects against SARS-CoV-2-induced lethal inflammation


Abstract: Summary

The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting millions of lives worldwide. Large retrospective studies indicate that an elevated level of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors are associated with both increased disease severity and mortality. Here, using multidimensional epigenetic, transcriptional, in vitro , and in vivo analyses, we report that topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic treatment with two doses of topotecan (TPT), an FDA-approved TOP1 inhibitor, suppresses infection-induced inflammation in hamsters. TPT treatment as late as 4 days post-infection reduces morbidity and rescues mortality in a transgenic mouse model. These results support the potential of TOP1 inhibition as an effective host-directed therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TPT and its derivatives are inexpensive clinical-grade inhibitors available in most countries. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of repurposing TOP1 inhibitors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.

Section: Introduction

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of lives worldwide and poses an overwhelming burden on global health systems and economy. The development of novel therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 remains a top priority. While prophylactic measures are being evaluated and distributed, drugs available to target SARS-CoV-2 and function therapeutically are direly needed, especially for severe cases of COVID-19.
Disease progression in severe COVID-19 features an initial phase of increasing viremia that wears off and is followed by a second phase characterized by a steep increase in systemic inflammation ( Lee et al., 2020 34. Lee, S. ∙ Channappanavar, R. ∙ Kanneganti, T.D.

Several studies have shown that levels of inflammatory molecules can help distinguish those who survive COVID-19 from those who do not. For example, increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrin degradation products (D-dimer), as well as other single measurements like C-reactive protein (CRP) or combined-measurement parameters (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; SOFA score), have been correlated with risk for death from COVID-19. ( Zhou et al., 2020a 79. Zhou, F. ∙ Yu, T. ∙ Du, R. ... Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study Lancet. 2020; 395 :1054-1062 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, all non-survivors experienced sepsis ( Zhou et al., 2020a 79. Zhou, F. ∙ Yu, T. ∙ Du, R. ... Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study Lancet. 2020; 395 :1054-1062 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the increased systemic inflammation that occurs during disease progression provides a biological rationale for interrupting hyper-inflammation to reduce disease severity. Guided by this logic, clinical trials have begun to examine the efficacy of cytokine blockers and anti-inflammatory molecules as potential COVID-19 therapeutics ( Merad and Martin, 2020 48. Merad, M. ∙ Martin, J.C. Pathological inflammation in patients with COVID-19: a key role for monocytes and macrophages Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :355-362 Crossref Scopus (1750) PubMed Google Scholar ).
However, inhibition of single cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) might not be sufficient ( Hermine et al., 2021 25. Hermine, O. ∙ Mariette, X. ∙ Tharaux, P.L. ..., CORIMUNO-19 Collaborative Group Effect of Tocilizumab vs Usual Care in Adults Hospitalized With COVID-19 and Moderate or Severe Pneumonia: A Randomized Clinical Trial JAMA Intern. Med. 2021; 181 :32-40 Crossref Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ; Salvarani et al., 2021 62. Salvarani, C. ∙ Dolci, G. ∙ Massari, M. ... Effect of Tocilizumab vs Standard Care on Clinical Worsening in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Randomized Clinical Trial JAMA Intern. Med. 2021; 181 :24-31 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is due to the fact that many signaling molecules and pathways are involved in triggering an inflammatory response. Additionally, levels of individual cytokines can vary depending on the age and the clinical history of the patient, thus limiting the scope of therapeutics that only target a single inflammatory molecule.
Infection causes a rapid and orchestrated gene induction governed by expression of antiviral and inflammatory mediators. This is often referred to as “infection-induced gene program.” In many instances, the magnitude of induction of the inflammatory components in a gene program can be overwhelming and become more harmful than protective. Such overt induction of inflammatory genes can be driven by unique features of the infectious agent. For example, viral antagonism in infected cells may delay initial responses, causing inappropriate and prolonged production of pro-inflammatory genes and immunopathology later in infection ( Channappanavar et al., 2016 11. Channappanavar, R. ∙ Fehr, A.R. ∙ Vijay, R. ...

Immunopathol. 2017; 39 :529-539 Crossref Scopus (1889) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, excessive inflammation may be immune mediated and driven by excessive local or systemic recruitment and activation of immune cells. The ultimate result is an overt expression of inflammatory mediators that is fatal to the host.
Reducing the magnitude of the induction of gene expression upon infection might hold the key to the development of novel therapeutics for infections associated with hyper-inflammation. Previously, we reported that chromatin factors play key roles in controlling the induction of inflammatory gene expression programs ( Marazzi et al., 2012 43. Marazzi, I. ∙ Ho, J.S. ∙ Kim, J. ... Suppression of the antiviral response by an influenza histone mimic Nature. 2012; 483 :428-433 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miller et al., 2015 49. Miller, M.S. ∙ Rialdi, A. ∙ Ho, J.S. ... Senataxin suppresses the antiviral transcriptional response and controls viral biogenesis Nat.

Suppression of inflammation by a synthetic histone mimic Nature. 2010; 468 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (1293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Targeting the activity of these proteins acting on the chromatin template, where infection-induced gene transcription is executed, leads to partial suppression (buffering) of multiple genes ( Marazzi et al., 2012 43. Marazzi, I. ∙ Ho, J.S. ∙ Kim, J. ... Suppression of the antiviral response by an influenza histone mimic Nature. 2012; 483 :428-433 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miller et al., 2015 49. Miller, M.S. ∙ Rialdi, A. ∙ Ho, J.S. ... Senataxin suppresses the antiviral transcriptional response and controls viral biogenesis Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16 :485-494 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nicodeme et al., 2010 54. Nicodeme, E. ∙ Jeffrey, K.L. ∙ Schaefer, U. ... Suppression of inflammation by a synthetic histone mimic Nature. 2010; 468 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (1293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such simultaneous inhibition of many virus-induced genes “in one go” can have a clear advantage over conventional single target therapies ( Marazzi et al., 2018 44. Marazzi, I. ∙ Greenbaum, B.D. ∙ Low, D.H.P. ... Chromatin dependencies in cancer and inflammation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :245-261 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In fact, there are at least two scenarios in which reducing the induction of gene expression upon infection could be advantageous. In the first scenario, partial suppression of infection-induced antiviral and inflammatory genes in the cells targeted by virus results in retaining an amount of antiviral molecules for blocking viral replication while avoiding excessive induction of inflammatory genes and pathways. A second scenario is when the gene programs are triggered by noninfected immune cells that respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in an overwhelmingly inflammatory fashion. This latter scenario occurs in many instances of infection that leads to sepsis.
We have previously shown that the host enzyme topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is required to fully transactivate infection-induced genes and thus controls the establishment of inflammatory gene programs during many viral and bacterial infection and co-infections ( Rialdi et al., 2016 59. Rialdi, A. ∙ Campisi, L. ∙ Zhao, N. ... Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :aad7993 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therapeutic administration (after infection) of one to three doses of topoisomerase inhibitors can rescue mortality in four animal models of inflammation-induced death ( Rialdi et al., 2016 59. Rialdi, A. ∙ Campisi, L. ∙ Zhao, N. ... Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :aad7993 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data support the hypothesis that host-directed epigenetic therapy can suppress hyper-inflammatory responses upon infection without compromising pathogen clearance. At that time (2016), we also predicted that this strategy could be useful for future pandemics. We present here a series of experiments in which we tested the hypothesis that modifying the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection with epigenetic therapy can ameliorate severe COVID-19.

Section: Results

Cell signaling cascades converge on chromatin to dictate changes in gene expression upon cell-intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Gene expression programs are controlled by transcriptional activity, which is, in turn, influenced by changes in chromatin structural (physical movement of genes into chromatin compartments or enhancer-promoter interaction) and functional (epigenetic modifications that demarcate regions of gene activity) organization.
Comparison between how a signal is received and decoded at the chromatin level and the final output of gene expression can elucidate how a pathogen alters the host gene expression program during infection. More importantly, it can instruct the targeting of chromatin factors in order to achieve a partial suppression (buffering) of infection-induced gene expression programs.
In an effort to understand how SARS-CoV-2 alters chromatin function and gene activity upon infection, we performed a combined structural and epigenetic analysis during infection.
To first characterize structural chromatin changes, we performed Hi-C on uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected A549 cells expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (A549-ACE2) at both early (8 h) and late (24 h) time points post-infection. Reproducible results were achieved across replicates for all time points ( Table S1 ). Our analysis indicates that large portions of the genome alter their global interaction profiles as infection progresses, culminating in a major redistribution of chromatin associated with either the active (A) or inactive (B) compartments at the 24-h time point ( Figure 1 A).
Notably, compartment changes result in a shortening of the domain size, with large linear stretches of A and B compartment chromatin generally becoming divided into A/B subdomains ( Figures 1 A and 1B). To determine whether these topological effects are unique to SARS-CoV-2, we performed temporal Hi-C profile during infection by influenza A virus (IAV). Our results indicate that similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection, influenza virus infection causes A-B and B-A changes and domain shortening at later time points post-infection ( Figures S1 A and S1B). These results indicate that chromosomal compartmentalization is affected by infection-induced signals, suggesting that large chromatin domains (megabases) lose structural constraints imposed by cohesin ( Rao et al., 2017 58. Rao, S.S.P. ∙ Huang, S.C. ∙ Glenn St Hilaire, B. ... Cohesin Loss Eliminates All Loop Domains Cell. 2017; 171 :305-320.e24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1094) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schwarzer et al., 2017 64. Schwarzer, W. ∙ Abdennur, N. ∙ Goloborodko, A. ... Two independent modes of chromatin organization revealed by cohesin removal Nature. 2017; 551 :51-56 Crossref Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar ),
While the resolution limit of Hi-C does not allow to us characterize single genes in A and B domains, we could still determine if the large-scale structural changes were associated with functional changes to chromatin organization and transcriptional activity. To do this, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (K27ac), an epigenetic mark found at active regulatory regions (promoters and enhancers) that is commonly used to monitor dynamic changes in transcriptional activation. ChIP-seq for K27ac was performed in uninfected and infected A549-ACE2 cells at both early (8 h) and late (24 h) time points post-infection. Our analysis showed high correlation of K27ac levels between replicates ( Figure S1 C). While some regions of the genome showed no change in K27ac levels upon infection (cluster i), there were significant changes in K27ac levels at promoters and other regulatory regions during the course of infection (clusters ii–vii; Figure 1 C; Tables S2 A–S2C). Regions that significantly gain (clusters v and vi; Figure 1 C) and lose K27ac (clusters ii and iii; Figure 1 C) over the course of infection were detected.
We then combined structural and functional information by overlaying the changes in K27ac and DNA topology. Our analysis indicates that regions that gain or lose K27ac are enriched in chromatin domains that move from B-A (inactive to active) or A-B (active to inactive) compartments, respectively ( Figure 1 E). This partitioning occurs dynamically throughout infection ( Figure 1 E; compare 8 h versus 24 h) and is associated with gene expression activity ( Figure 1 F). These results suggest that the dynamic restructuring of genome compartmentalization by SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly associated with transcriptional activity.
To characterize whether a unique set of transcription factors might drive these changes, we performed motif enrichment analysis of regions displaying differential H3K27ac activity. Our results indicate that repressed regions lack unique enrichment of immune-specific transcription factors at promoters, enhancers, and other putative regulatory regions ( Figure S1 D; Table S2 D). Regions that gain K27ac signal display a strong enrichment for motifs recognized by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (red bars), AP1 (orange bars), and to a lesser extent interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors (green and blue bars respectively, clusters v and vi; Figure S1 D; Table S2 D). These data suggest that the epigenetic landscape established as a result of the infection (and viral antagonism) is skewed toward the usage of regulatory regions controlling inflammatory responses
To then provide direct evidence that identified regulatory regions do indeed contact a given gene promoters to sustain gene transactivation, we performed promoter capture Hi-C. This technique measures enhancer-promoter interactions at a single-gene resolution. Promoter capture Hi-C was conducted in SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-ACE2 cells at 8 and 24 hpi, as well as in uninfected cells (0 hpi). Following alignment and quality control, we detected a total of 63,804 interactions between 11,244 promoters and 40,387 promoter-interacting regions (PIRs) across the three time points using CHiCAGO ( Cairns et al., 2016 9. Cairns, J. ∙ Freire-Pritchett, P. ∙ Wingett, S.W. ... CHiCAGO: robust detection of DNA looping interactions in Capture Hi-C data Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :127 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on unsupervised clustering and post hoc filtering, we classified the promoter interactions into three broad categories based on their dynamics upon infection: 10,983 “lost,” 11,022 “retained,” and 11,334 “gained” (see STAR Methods for details).
To obtain a gene-level view, we computed the change in the number of active enhancers connected to each gene between 0 and 24 hpi, accounting for promoter interaction rewiring and changes in enhancer activity at the PIRs of either preexisting or novel contacts. We found a significant association between this property and gene expression dynamics ( Figure 1 G; Fisher’s test p = 0.008). In particular, an increase in the number of promoter-connected active enhancers associated with upregulation of their respective target genes ( Figure 1 G; log-odds ratio [LOR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13–1.30). Examples of the detected promoter interaction profiles at each time point for TIPARP and NFKIBIZ genes that are strongly induced upon infection (log2 fold change [log2FC] > 1) are shown in Figures 1 H and S1 E, respectively.
Overall, our results characterized the epithelial cell gene expression programs upon infection with respect to global topological effects, as well as local topological and epigenetic changes that dictate enhancer-promoter rewiring and gene activity. Our results indicate that because of infection-induced epigenetic remodeling and the effect of viral antagonism geared to suppress antiviral responses ( Banerjee et al., 2020b 5. Banerjee, A.K. ∙ Blanco, M.R. ∙ Bruce, E.A. ... SARS-CoV-2 Disrupts Splicing, Translation, and Protein Trafficking to Suppress Host Defenses Cell. 2020; 183 :1325-1339.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lei et al., 2020 35. Lei, X. ∙ Dong, X. ∙ Ma, R. ... Activation and evasion of type I interferon responses by SARS-CoV-2 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3810 Crossref Scopus (704) PubMed Google Scholar ), infection induces genes that are mostly inflammatory. These genes are regulated by specific repertoire of transcription factors and display prototypical epigenetic features of transactivation, suggesting that unique host chromatin factors dictate the magnitude of their transcriptional induction.
To determine whether chromatin factors can control the transactivation of SARS-CoV-2-induced genes, we focused our attention on TOP1, a factor known to activate bacterial- and viral-infection-induced genes ( Rialdi et al., 2016 59. Rialdi, A. ∙ Campisi, L. ∙ Zhao, N. ... Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :aad7993 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of TOP1 (siTOP1) along with control siRNA (siSCR) in A549-ACE2 cells, followed by mock treatment (PBS only; uninfected controls) or infection with SARS-CoV-2. Gene expression changes in these cells were quantified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at 24 h post-infection (hpi). Our analyses indicate that siTOP1 treated cells had a distinct transcriptional response to the virus ( Figure 2 A) as compared to no siRNA or siSCR-treated cells, resulting in selective suppression of many infection-induced genes (fold change > 1.5, adjusted p value [padj] < 0.05; Figures 2 B and 2C; Tables S3 . Gene Ontology (GO) pathway analyses of genes that are downregulated upon TOP1 knockdown suggest that many of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses ( Figure 2 C; Table S3 C). We further validated our results by qPCR for representative genes IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, EGR1, and TNFAIP3 ( Figure 2 D), verifying that depletion of TOP1 protein levels ( Figure 2 E) reduces the expression of these inflammatory genes.
To understand the specificity of TOP1, we profiled infection-induced and TOP1 dependent genes (“Dep.”; Table S3 D) identified in Figure 2 B with respect to their structural and epigenetic status at basal state and after infection. As controls, we used all expressed genes (“Exp”; Table S3 D) or genes that are also induced by infection but unaffected by TOP1 depletion (TOP1 independent, “Indep.”; Table S3 D). Our analysis indicates that genes that depend on TOP1 for their upregulation are induced to higher levels then TOP1-independent genes upon infection ( Figure 2 F). TOP1-dependent genes also displayed greater shifts toward active chromatin compartment (positive delta PC1 levels; Figure 2 G) and increases in K27ac signals (positive delta H3K27ac levels; Figure 2 H) and an increase in number of enhancers (Wilcoxon p = 0.015) compared to TOP1-independent genes. These differences are typical features of genes that are amenable for selective inhibition by transcriptional and epigenetic inhibitors ( Marazzi et al., 2018 44. Marazzi, I. ∙ Greenbaum, B.D. ∙ Low, D.H.P. ... Chromatin dependencies in cancer and inflammation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :245-261 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine whether inhibition of TOP1 activity phenocopies depletion of TOP1 and dampens inflammatory gene expression, we treated SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-ACE2 cells with topotecan (TPT), a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved TOP1 inhibitor. TPT treatment, unlike DMSO treatment, dampens the expression of IL-6, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, EGR1, and TNFAIP3 ( Figure S2 A), similar to what we observed in siTOP1-treated cells ( Figures 2 B and 2D). Reduced inflammatory gene expression was not a result of a direct antiviral effect of TPT. Unlike remdesivir, a drug with known antiviral activity toward SARS-CoV-2, TPT does not inhibit viral replication ( Figures S2 B and S2C), suggesting that its activity is directed toward suppression of host gene expression.
To determine if inhibition of TOP1 activity can dampen inflammatory gene expression in vivo , we assessed the effects of TPT treatment in the golden Syrian hamster model ( Muñoz-Fontela et al., 2020 51. Muñoz-Fontela, C. ∙ Dowling, W.E. ∙ Funnell, S.G.P. ... Animal models for COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 586 :509-515 Crossref Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ) (hereafter referred as hamster), a nonlethal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Imai et al., 2020 28. Imai, M. ∙ Iwatsuki-Horimoto, K. ∙ Hatta, M. ... Syrian hamsters as a small animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and countermeasure development Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :16587-16595 Crossref Scopus (678) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sia et al., 2020 66. Sia, S.F. ∙ Yan, L.M. ∙ Chin, A.W.H. ... Pathogenesis and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in golden hamsters Nature. 2020; 583 :834-838 Crossref Scopus (941) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We treated SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with either vehicle control (DMSO) or 10 mg/kg TPT at days 1 and 2 post-infection. Lungs from these animals were then collected for histology and transcriptome analysis at days 4 and 6 post-infection ( Figure 3 A).
Clustering of RNA-seq reads using principal-component analysis (PCA) indicates that the gene expression profiles under the three conditions (uninfected, infected/DMSO treated, and infected/TPT treated) partition based on infection, treatment status, and the temporality of the infection (days 4 and 6), with each replicate clustering in close proximity to its counterpart ( Figure 3 B).
Differential expression (DE) analysis showed that TPT suppresses inflammatory gene expression in the lungs of infected hamsters ( Figures 3 C and 3D; Tables S4 A and S4B). Clustering of the DE data indicates that the gene expression profiles of TPT-treated infected lungs are more similar to that of the noninfected lungs rather than infected ones ( Figure 3 C). The GO categories associated with the TPT-suppressed genes indicates specific inhibition of virus-induced and inflammatory genes at both day 4 and day 6 post-infection ( Figure 3 D; Tables S4 C and S4D).
Histopathological analysis of infected, DMSO vehicle-treated hamster lungs at days 4 and 6 post-infection displayed diffused alveoli destruction, bronchiolar epithelium cell death, and hemorrhaging, coupled with massive immune cell infiltration and exudation, typically associated with increased expression of inflammatory mediators and recruitment of immune cells during infection ( Figures 3 E and 3F). On the contrary, TPT treatment diminished pathological features of lung damage in infected animals. Lungs from these animals did not have conspicuous alveolar space infiltration, exudation, or hemorrhaging at both days 4 and 6 post-infection ( Figures 3 G and 3H).
To determine the clinical significance of our observations, we then asked if the genes that were downregulated by TPT treatment in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters also corresponded to immunopathological gene signatures that have been observed in COVID-19 patients. Cross-comparison of our results with the gene expression profiles in human lungs isolated from autopsies of COVID-19 patients and uninfected control lungs ( Nienhold et al., 2020 55. Nienhold, R. ∙ Ciani, Y. ∙ Koelzer, V.H. ... Two distinct immunopathological profiles in autopsy lungs of COVID-19 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5086 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicated that TPT-suppressed genes are hyperactivated in patients who succumbed to infection ( Figures 4 A and 4B). In fact, TPT-inhibited genes are genes that are upregulated in COVID-19 lung autopsy tissue relative to healthy control (p < 1E-3) ( Figure 4 A, left panel), while genes upregulated by TPT are downregulated in COVID-19 lung relative to control (p < 1E-7) ( Figure 4 A, right panel). These results suggest that treatment with TPT might reverse COVID-19-induced lung gene expression responses. The gene expression profiles of TPT-inhibited genes in individual patients (heatmap, Figure 4 B) and the corresponding gene set enrichment scores are shown in Figure 4 B.
SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells induce limited type I and type II interferon responses ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020 7. Blanco-Melo, D. ∙ Nilsson-Payant, B.E. ∙ Liu, W.C. ... Imbalanced Host Response to SARS-CoV-2 Drives Development of COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 181 :1036-1045.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2981) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since we observe that these genes are downregulated in the presence of TPT in infected hamster lungs ( Figure 3 D), this suggested that TPT may also act on immune cells that are recruited to and/or activated in the lung upon infection. To determine if the TPT-dependent transcriptomic signature we observe is driven by suppression of inflammatory genes solely in epithelial cells or also from immune cells, we performed gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of gene expression profiles in immune cell types derived from single cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients with severe disease or from healthy controls ( Liao et al., 2020 38. Liao, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Yuan, J. ... Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :842-844 Crossref Scopus (1710) PubMed Google Scholar ). Doing so allowed us to characterize immune-cell-type-specific transcriptome signatures during infection with SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses indicate that a subset of genes suppressed by TPT in our animal model are expressed specifically by immune cells (macrophage, neutrophil, and dendritic cells) isolated from severe COVID-19 cases and not in healthy controls ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Notably, an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature appears to mainly reside in phagocytes; however, the nature of the cells that produce the interferons and the nature of the interferons themselves that drive ISGs remain largely unknown.
Immune cells are unlikely to be productively infected by SARS-CoV-2 ( Banerjee et al., 2020a 4. Banerjee, A. ∙ Nasir, J.A. ∙ Budylowski, P. ... Isolation, Sequence, Infectivity, and Replication Kinetics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2020; 26 :2054-2063 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ), so their infection-induced gene programs targeted by TPT treatment are most likely driven by PAMP/DAMP-dependent stimulation (e.g., viral RNA released from apoptotic cells) or cytokine signaling from bystander infected epithelial cells. To determine if this is true, we performed in vitro experiments in THP-1, a human monocytic cell line. Our data indicate that TPT suppresses, in a concentration-dependent manner, inflammatory genes in response to purified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or supernatant from productively infected cells ( Figure S3 C). We were unable to detect productive SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cells, in line with a previous report ( Banerjee et al., 2020a 4. Banerjee, A. ∙ Nasir, J.A. ∙ Budylowski, P. ... Isolation, Sequence, Infectivity, and Replication Kinetics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2020; 26 :2054-2063 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, our analyses support the idea that TPT is active in both epithelial and immune cells and suppresses inflammatory gene programs induced by the infection.
We next sought to validate whether lower dosages of TPT, which are associated with negligible cytostatic effects ( Guichard et al., 2001 22. Guichard, S. ∙ Montazeri, A. ∙ Chatelut, E. ...

We performed a parallel experiment to the one described in Figure 3 A using 5-fold-lower dose of TPT (2 mg/kg) and the same regimen of TPT treatment at days 1 and 2 post-infection ( Figure S4 A). Lungs from infected and treated hamsters were assayed at day 4 post-infection.
Animals treated with TPT had reduced lung to body weight ratios post-infection ( Figure S4 B), which suggest reduced pulmonary edemas in these animals. In line with this, histopathological analyses showed reduced broncho-pneumonia ( Figures S4 C–S4E) and immune cell infiltration ( Table S5 ) in the lungs of TPT-treated animals when compared to DMSO-treated ones. qPCR analysis of representative genes also suggested reduced expression of inflammatory genes in TPT-treated animals ( Figure S4 F).
Gene suppression and reduced lung damage occurred despite of a moderate 3-fold increase virus growth at day 4, where both TPT- and DMSO-treated lungs display similar viral titer. By day 8, virus growth in both TPT and DMSO treatment ceased to an undetectable level ( Figure S4 G), suggesting that TPT treatment does not change the overall kinetics of viral clearance.
Overall, these results suggest that lower doses of TPT treatment can still effectively suppress the expression of inflammatory molecules and ameliorate inflammation-induced pathology during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that TPT suppresses SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation in vivo .
To further verify our results, we extended our studies to a complementary model and evaluated the effects of TPT treatment in transgenic mice that express the human ACE2 receptor under the cytokeratin 18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2). This mouse strain is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and displays a disease progression profile that shares many features of severe COVID-19 ( Winkler et al., 2020 74. Winkler, E.S. ∙ Bailey, A.L. ∙ Kafai, N.M. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection of human ACE2-transgenic mice causes severe lung inflammation and impaired function Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1327-1335 Crossref Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, loss of pulmonary function and weight loss in these mice occurs after the peak of viral replication and coincides with infiltration of immune cells (monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils) in the lung and alveolar spaces at day 4 post-infection ( Winkler et al., 2020 74. Winkler, E.S. ∙ Bailey, A.L. ∙ Kafai, N.M. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection of human ACE2-transgenic mice causes severe lung inflammation and impaired function Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1327-1335 Crossref Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, K18-hACE2 has been suggested as a model to define the basis of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung disease and test immune and antiviral countermeasures ( Bao et al., 2020 6. Bao, L. ∙ Deng, W. ∙ Huang, B. ... The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice Nature. 2020; 583 :830-833 Crossref Scopus (840) PubMed Google Scholar ; Winkler et al., 2020 74. Winkler, E.S. ∙ Bailey, A.L. ∙ Kafai, N.M. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection of human ACE2-transgenic mice causes severe lung inflammation and impaired function Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1327-1335 Crossref Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To test whether TPT-mediated reduction of inflammation provides a protective effect in infected K18-hACE2 mice, we performed three different regimes of TPT treatments, labeled as early, intermediate, and late, to respectively describe dosing of the inhibitor at 2 mg/kg on days 1+2, 3+4, or 4+5 post-infection respectively ( Figures 5 A and S5 A).
The rationale behind this approach is that inhibition of inflammation could be detrimental during the early phases of the infection. The optimal protective effect of inhibiting inflammation should be achieved during the hyper-inflammatory phase of the disease, which would coincide with the later stage of infection. Late suppression of inflammatory response would have the added benefit of not altering early phases of the antiviral response. Indeed, our results showed that early and intermediate treatment of TPT is ineffective in reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figures S5 B and S5C), despite intermediate TPT treatment significantly delaying the onset of weight loss (p = 0.0028, two-way ANOVA [mixed effects]).
Strikingly, we found that late TPT treatment provided significant survival benefit (p = 0.0085, log-rank Mantel-Cox) to infected mice when compared to DMSO-vehicle-treated controls ( Figure 5 B). In addition, TPT significantly improved morbidity outcomes in infected mice. Despite an overall delay in weight loss kinetics in TPT mice ( Figure 5 C), fewer mice lost >15% of their body weight compared to DMSO-treated mice ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.0409, Fisher’s exact test). Importantly, TPT administration did not significantly change viral titers immediately after treatment (day 7 post-infection, Figure 5 E), nor did it delay viral clearance kinetics, as no detectable virus, as measured by plaque assays, was found in the lungs of both TPT- and DMSO-treated mice by day 14 post-infection ( Figure 5 E). As expected, TPT treatment was also associated with suppression of inflammatory gene expression in the lung, as indicated by qPCR of representative genes ( Figure 5 F) and supporting our initial hypotheses.
Finally, we assessed longer-term effects of TPT treatment in mice. TPT-treated mice survived past 9 weeks post-infection, with post-recovery weight gain levels ( Figure 5 G) similar to those of DMSO-treated mice. Levels of neutralizing antibody activity in the blood of DMSO- and TPT-treated mice were similar at 5 weeks post-infection ( Figure 5 H), suggesting that TPT treatment does not negatively impact adaptive immune responses.
Overall, our results indicate that inhibition of hyper-inflammation by therapeutic administration of TPT can rescue K18-hACE2 mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Section: Discussion

Although the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully characterized, it has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers hyper-activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α]) and chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL2) ( Huang et al., 2020 27.

The increased level of inflammatory molecules has been shown to correlate with COVID-19 disease severity ( Del Valle et al., 2020 16. Del Valle, D.M. ∙ Kim-Schulze, S. ∙ Huang, H.H. ...

While the exact mechanism and cell-type-specific contributions to hyper-inflammation still needs to be fully elucidated, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are primary candidates and have been reported to contribute to the cytokine-mediated immunopathology seen in human ( Del Valle et al., 2020 16.

This is supported by previous studies of the immune response against SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections ( Cheung et al., 2005 14.

Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2004; 136 :95-103 Crossref Scopus (1056) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, non-myeloid cells have been recently shown to contribute to the hyper-inflammatory program ( Zhou et al., 2020b 80. Zhou, Y. ∙ Fu, B. ∙ Zheng, X. ... Pathogenic T-cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storms in severe COVID-19 patients Natl. Sci. Rev. 2020; 7 :998-1002 Crossref Scopus (834) PubMed Google Scholar ). Elevated inflammatory responses contribute to sepsis and multi-organ failure, major causes of death from COVID-19 ( Zhou et al., 2020a 79. Zhou, F. ∙ Yu, T. ∙ Du, R. ... Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study Lancet. 2020; 395 :1054-1062 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, treatments that can suppress host inflammatory response might be effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. In this light, it is important to highlight that glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and hydrocortisone), which act as suppressors of systemic inflammation, have been reported to ameliorate the outcome of COVID-19, especially in hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen ( WHO REACT Working Group et al., 2020 72.

Association Between Administration of Systemic Corticosteroids and Mortality Among Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: a Meta-analysis JAMA. 2020; 324 :1330-1341 Crossref Scopus (1719) PubMed Google Scholar ).
While our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is expanding rapidly, little is known about how epigenetic modifications and genome structure are affected by infection and in what capacity they affect gene activity ( Liu et al., 2020 40. Liu, X. ∙ Hong, T. ∙ Parameswaran, S. ... Human Virus Transcriptional Regulators Cell. 2020; 182 :24-37 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection imposes both global and local (gene-specific) effects on host chromatin, ultimately dictating gene induction and suppression, and the establishment of a gene expression program in the infected cell.
Regarding SARS-CoV-2-infection-induced compartment movement, we surmise that A-B (active to inactive) and B-A (inactive to active) switches are driven by transcriptional and epigenome activity. While A-B transitions are characterized by decreased K27ac at promoters and gene suppression, B-A is accompanied by increased K27ac at promoters and enhancers, enhancer-promoter interactions, and transcriptional induction. Gene suppression has functional consequences, as it affects many conventional infection-induced genes activated by STAT1/2 and IRF3 transcription factors. Suppression is likely a result of viral antagonism. Gene activation is the result of signal-induced transactivation and indicates that many cellular genes escape viral suppression during infection. One prominent example is a subset of inflammatory genes whose expression is driven by infection-activated transcription factor NF-κB. The proteins encoded by these genes are potent pro-inflammatory molecules and present systemically with high levels in severe COVID-19 patients ( Del Valle et al., 2020 16. Del Valle, D.M. ∙ Kim-Schulze, S. ∙ Huang, H.H. ... An inflammatory cytokine signature predicts COVID-19 severity and survival Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1636-1643 Crossref Scopus (1623) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moore and June, 2020 50. Moore, J.B. ∙ June, C.H. Cytokine release syndrome in severe COVID-19 Science. 2020; 368 :473-474 Crossref Scopus (1428) PubMed Google Scholar ). The selective and concerted induction of inflammatory genes provides the rationale for using epigenetic inhibitors to suppress their induction and establish a global anti-inflammatory state ( Marazzi et al., 2018 44. Marazzi, I. ∙ Greenbaum, B.D. ∙ Low, D.H.P. ... Chromatin dependencies in cancer and inflammation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :245-261 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We show that the host enzyme TOP1 promotes transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We then demonstrate that TOP1 inhibition limits the expression of inflammatory genes in the lungs of infected animals. Most importantly, TOP1 inhibition decreases morbidity and morbidity in infected mice. The therapeutic effect can be achieved by drug administration 4–5 days following infection.
The suppression of inflammation in vivo is most likely the result of not only a dampened epithelial response but also neutrophil/monocytic cell activation and response. Based on our experiments and gene signature analyses of specific cell types, we posit that TPT suppresses inducible transcriptional programs in both infected and bystander cells. Dampening highly inducible genes and sparing housekeeper genes is a typical feature of epigenetic inhibitors that act on signal-induced genes, which aside from the requirement of cofactors for their activation have unifying genomic features like high burst rates conferred by many regulatory enhancers ( Chen et al., 2019 13.

Enhancer-core-promoter specificity separates developmental and housekeeping gene regulation Nature. 2015; 518 :556-559 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Lethal inflammation in severe COVID-19 has been associated with the dysregulation of multiple inflammatory genes, including IL-6, IL-1, and IL-10. However, many of the current strategies proposed to treat severe COVID-19, such as anti-IL-6 (e.g., tocilizumab and sarilumab) or anti-IL-1 (e.g., anakinra) inhibitors, are directed against single inflammatory mediators and specific gene expression programs. The effects of such drugs may be undermined by alternative gene activation pathways driven by other cytokines/transcription factors.
In contrast, TPT functions to broadly dampen inflammatory gene expression programs, regardless of the cell or activation pathways. Inhibition of systemic inflammation using the glucocorticoid dexamethasone has been shown to provide survival benefit to severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting that this is indeed a viable strategy. That being said, it is important to note that TPT and glucocorticoids have different molecular targets and exert anti-inflammatory effects via different molecular mechanisms of action.
Finally, TPT and other TOP1 inhibitors like irinotecan are widely available and FDA approved. Irinotecan is in the World Health Organization (WHO) list of essential medicines. They are inexpensive, and generic formulation exists throughout the world, making them easily accessible for immediate use. Overall, our results suggest that repurposing of TOP1 inhibitor could be a valuable strategy to treat severe COVID-19.
Our study indicates a promising effect of TPT in COVID-19 in preclinical animal models. As with any animal model, they are only partially representative of the biology of humans. In our animal models, we can suppress inflammation and reduce disease pathology in the lung using two doses of TOP1 inhibition therapy with TPT at 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally. This equates to a 5-fold reduction from typical chemotherapeutic anti-cancer doses in rodent models ( Guichard et al., 2001 22. Guichard, S. ∙ Montazeri, A. ∙ Chatelut, E. ...

In clinical practice, the TOP1 inhibitors TPT and irinotecan have well-characterized pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles ( Kollmannsberger et al., 1999 29. Kollmannsberger, C. ∙ Mross, K. ∙ Jakob, A. ...

Doses that are 5-fold lower than those used in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (TPT) ( Rowinsky et al., 1992 61. Rowinsky, E.K. ∙ Grochow, L.B. ∙ Hendricks, C.B. ...

Topotecan versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine for the treatment of recurrent small-cell lung cancer J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17 :658-667 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and colorectal cancer (irinotecan) ( André et al., 1999 3. André, T. ∙ Louvet, C. ∙ Maindrault-Goebel, F. ... CPT-11 (irinotecan) addition to bimonthly, high-dose leucovorin and bolus and continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) for pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer. GERCOR Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35 :1343-1347 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ) are expected to cause little to no toxicity and, importantly, no risk of neutropenia. Nonetheless, safety trials of the reduced dosage of TPT or irinotecan in COVID-19 patients will need to be performed prior to testing efficacy.
Another important consideration is that the window of opportunity for TOP1 inhibitor treatment in humans needs to be carefully evaluated. Many reports indicate that the timing of the intervention against coronaviruses is key, as protective antiviral and damaging excessive inflammatory responses need to be balanced ( Channappanavar et al., 2016 11. Channappanavar, R. ∙ Fehr, A.R. ∙ Vijay, R. ... Dysregulated Type I Interferon and Inflammatory Monocyte-Macrophage Responses Cause Lethal Pneumonia in SARS-CoV-Infected Mice Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :181-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1136) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 12. Channappanavar, R. ∙ Fehr, A.R. ∙ Zheng, J. ... IFN-I response timing relative to virus replication determines MERS coronavirus infection outcomes J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :3625-3639 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ; Grajales-Reyes and Colonna, 2020 21. Grajales-Reyes, G.E. ∙ Colonna, M. Interferon responses in viral pneumonias Science. 2020; 369 :626-627 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data align with those studies, as early treatment of TPT did not display protective effect in mice.
In essence, stratification of patients based on inflammatory marker is key, as suppressing gene programs too early during infection might compromise antiviral response together with limiting inflammatory responses, with the unwanted effect of increasing viral replication and dissemination. Accordingly, glucocorticoids can lead to increase in viral persistence in convalescent severe patients. Similarly, corticosteroid treatment has been suggested to have negative effects post-recovery in patients with non-severe COVID-19.
In line with this, inhibition of inflammation by TPT or other molecules that lower systemic inflammation could theoretically lead to a resurgence in viral replication and administration of an antiviral agent with activity against SARS-CoV-2 after anti-inflammatory therapy should be used.
The safety and efficacy of our strategy will now be evaluated in two clinical trials of TPT that have been submitted for trial initiation. Lastly, we strongly discourage any “off label” use of TOP1 inhibitors until safety and effectiveness is established by clinical trials.

For Infections with THP-1 cells ( Figure S3 C) and hamsters in Figure 3 , isolate HKG/13_P2/2020 (MT835140) was used. For Infections with hamsters in Figure S4 and all infections in K18-hACE2 mice ( Figures 5 and S5 ), isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was used. SARS-CoV-2 was grown in Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. Plaque assays were used to determine infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 by infection of Vero E6 cells in Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 2% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 0.12% NaHCO3 and 0.7% agar.
Generation of A549-ACE2 cells was performed as previously described ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020 7. Blanco-Melo, D. ∙ Nilsson-Payant, B.E. ∙ Liu, W.C. ...

Briefly, A549 cells were transduced with lentiviral vector pHR-PGK expressing human ACE2 coding sequence. A549 cells were then transduced with the lentivirus in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml). Cells were used for downstream assays after 48h post transduction.
7.5E4 A549-ACE2 cells were plated in a 24 well dishes. 16 hours post plating, cells were transfected with control, scrambled (siSCR), TOP1-targeting (siTOP1) or no siRNA (no siRNA) using Lipofectamine RNAiMax to a final concentration of 50nM. 48hours post transfection, the media was replaced, and fresh media was added to each well. Cells were then mock infected (PBS only) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.5. Viral isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was used in these experiments. 24 hours post infection, media was removed, and cells were lysed in 250ul of Trizol reagent (Thermo Scientific). RNA was then extracted using the Purelink RNA Minikit (Invitrogen) with DNaseI treatment, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the RNA 6000 Nano kit and the Eukaryote Total RNA Nano assay on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System. RNA quantity was determined by Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit.
To then prepare RNA-sequencing libraries, 300 ng of RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA using NEBNext® rRNA Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat), according to the manusfacturer’s instructions. Libraries were then prepared from rRNA depleted RNA using the NEBNext® Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina®, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Final libraries were quantified and sizing was determined using the High Sensitivity DNA Assay reagents and chip in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System and the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit respectively. Individual libraries were then pooled and sequenced using 75bp paired end on the NextSeq 550 using the NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit
To prepare ChIP-Sequencing libraries, ∼2E5 A549-ACE2 cells were plated into 12 well dishes. Cells were either mock infected (PBS only) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI 0.5. Viral isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was used in these experiments. 24 hours post infection, media was removed from the well, and replaced with Fixation buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 1% Methanol-Free Formaldehye). Cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min. 2M Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 0.125M, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 5min to quench the reaction. Supernatants were removed from wells, and each well was washed 3 times with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed in the well using 250ul of SDS Lysis Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris pH8.0, 5mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 0.5% SDS + 1X Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific)] and cell lysates were collected in a 1.5ml tube and snap frozen at −80°C. On the day of sonication, lysates were thawed, and diluted with 125ul of Triton Dilution Buffer [100mM Tris pH8.5, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 5% Triton X-100 + 1X Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor]. Lysates were then sonicated for 5 - 30 s ON/ 30 s OFF cycles twice using the Bioruptor Pico. Each sonicated lysate was then pre-cleared using 10ul of Rabbit-IgG Dynabeads for 1 hour, rotating at 4°C. 1ug of anti-H3K27ac antibody was then added to 300ul of pre-cleared lysate. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with overnight rotation at 4°C. To recover IP-complexes, 10ul of Dynabeads M-280 Sheep anti-Rabbit IgG were added to each reaction and tubes were rotated for 2 hours at 4°C. Bead-chromatin complexes were then washed 6 times on a magnet using ice cold RIPA wash buffer [50mM HEPES-KOH pH7.6, 100mM LiCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-Deoxycholate]. Washed beads were then incubated in 125ul Elution buffer [1% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO3] at 65°C overnight for elution and de-crosslinking. ChIP DNA was then purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and quantified using the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit.
ChIP libraries were prepared using the NEBNext® Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following the manufacturer’s recommendations. 1ng of ChIP-DNA was used to prepare each library. ChIP input libraries were prepared by pooling equal amounts of purified sonicated and non-IPed DNA from each sample. 1ng of the pooled ChIP-input DNA was used for library preparation. Libraries were quantified and sizing was determined using the High Sensitivity DNA Assay reagents and chip in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System and the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit respectively. Individual libraries were then pooled and sequenced 75bp paired end on the NextSeq 550 using the NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5.
In situ Hi-C was performed as described ( Heinz et al., 2018 24. Heinz, S. ∙ Texari, L. ∙ Hayes, M.G.B. ... Transcription Elongation Can Affect Genome 3D Structure Cell. 2018; 174 :1522-1536.e1522 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. The day before infection, 200k A549-ACE2 cells were plated in a 12 well dishes. Cells were either mock-infected (PBS only) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI 0.5. Viral isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was used in these experiments. Twenty-four hours post infection, media was removed from the well, and replaced with Fixation buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 1% Methanol-Free Formaldehyde). Cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min. 2M Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 0.125M, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 5min to quench the reaction. Supernatants were then removed wells, and each well was washed 2 times with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed in the well using 250 μl of Lysis Buffer [0.5% SDS + Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitors (Thermo Scientific)]. Cell lysates were collected in a 1.5ml tube. 1.5 mU RNaseA (Thermo Scientific) was added to each lysate, and lysates were then incubated at 37oC for 1h. RNaseA treated lysates were then snap frozen and stored in −80°C. After thawing, nuclei were collected at 1500 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Most of the supernatant was discarded, leaving the nuclei in 10 μl liquid. Samples were resuspended in reaction buffer (25 μl 10% Triton X-100, 25 μl 10x Dpn II buffer, 188 μl water) and rotated at 37°C, 8 RPM for 15 minutes. Chromatin was digested overnight (ON) with either 2 μl (100 U) Dpn II (NEB) (later experiments) at 37°C, rotating overhead with 8 RPM. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 minutes at room temperature, 225 μl of the supernatant were discarded, leaving the nuclei in 25 μl liquid, and overhangs were filled in with Biotin-14-dATP by adding 75 μl Klenow Master Mix (54.45 μl water, 7.5 μl NEBuffer 2, 0.35 μl 10 mM dCTP, 0.35 μl 10 mM dTTP, 0.35 μl 10 mM dGTP, 7.5 μl 0.4 mM Biotin-14-dATP (Invitrogen), 2 μl 10% Triton X-100, 2.5 μl (12.5 U) Klenow fragment (Enzymatics)) and rotating overhead at RT, 8 RPM for 40 minutes. Reactions were stopped by adding 2.5 μl 0.5 M EDTA and placed on ice. Proximity ligation was performed by transferring the entire reaction into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 400 μl ligase mix (322.5 μl water, 40 μl 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer (Enzymatics), 36 μl 10% Triton X-100, 0.5 μl 10% BSA, 1 μl (600 U) T4 DNA ligase (HC, Enzymatics) and rotating ON at 16°C, 8 RPM. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl 0.5 M EDTA, treated with 1 μl 10 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A for 15 minutes at 42°C, then 31 μl 5 M NaCl, 29 μl 10% SDS and 5 μl 20 mg/ml DNase-free proteinase K (Thermo) were added, proteins digested for 1 h at 55°C while shaking at 800 RPM, then crosslinks reversed ON at 65°C. After extraction with 600 μl pH 8-buffered phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Ambion) followed by extraction with 600 μl chloroform, DNA was precipitated with 1.5 μl (22.5 μg) Glycoblue (Ambion) and 1400 μl 100% ethanol ON at −20°C. After centrifugation for 20’ at 16000 g, 4°C, the DNA pellet was washed twice with 80% ethanol, and the pellet air-dried and dissolved in 131 μl TT (0.05% Tween 20/Tris pH 8). DNA (200 ng) was sheared to 300 bp in 130 μl TT on a Covaris E220 sonicator using the manufacturer’s protocol. Biotinylated DNA was captured on Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Thermo) by combining the sonicated DNA sample (130 μl) with 20 μl Dynabeads that had previously been washed with 1x B&W buffer (2X B&W: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl) and had been resuspended in 130 μl 2x B&W containing 0.2% Tween 20. The binding reaction was rotated at RT for 45 minutes, and DNA-bound beads were vigorously washed twice with 150 μl 1x B&W/0.1% Triton X-100, once with 180 μl TET (0.05% Tween 20, 10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA). Libraries were prepared on-beads using an NEBnext Ultra II DNA library prep kit using half the reagent/reaction volumes given in NEB’s instruction manual and 1.6 pmol Bioo DNA sequencing adapters (Illumina TruSeq-compatible) per reaction. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl 0.5 M EDTA, beads collected on a magnet and washed twice with 150 μl 1x B&W/0.1% Triton X-100, twice with 180 μl TET and resuspended in 20 μl TT (0.05% Tween 20, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0). Libraries were amplified by PCR for 10 cycles (98°C, 30 s; 10x [98°C, 10 s; 63°C, 20 s; 72°C, 30 s]; 72°C, 2 min; 4°C, ∞), using 10 μl of the bead suspension in a 50 μl reaction with NEBNext Ultra II Q5 2x master mix (NEB) and 0.5 μM each Solexa 1GA/1GB primers (Solexa 1GA: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGA, Solexa 1GB: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA). Libraries were precipitated onto magnetic beads by adding 40 μl 20% PEG8000/2.5 M NaCl and 2 μl SpeedBeads (8.9% PEG final) to 48 μl PCR reaction, thorough mixing by vortexing followed by 10-minute incubation at RT. Beads were collected using a magnet and the supernatant discarded. After washing beads twice by adding 180 μl 80% EtOH, moving the tube strip 6x from side to side of the magnet, collecting beads and discarding the supernatant, beads were air-dried, and DNA eluted by adding 20 μl TT. Libraries were sequenced paired-end for 42 cycles each to a depth of approximately 250 million reads per experiment on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer.
For RNA sequencing analyses in infected hamsters shown in Figure 3 , infected hamsters that were treated with TPT or vehicle control, were euthanized at days 4 and 6 post infection. Uninfected hamsters were used as controls. After euthanasia, lung left inferior lobe from hamsters were cut into pieces and lysed with RA1 lysis buffer provided with the NucleoSpin ® RNA Plus kit (Macherey-nagel), RNA extraction was performed according the manufacturer’s recommendations, including an on-column genomic DNA digestion step. RNA sequencing library preparation and sequencing were then performed by BGI Genomics
For experiments shown in Figure 3 , Female Golden Syrian hamster, aged 6-8 week old (∼70-100 g), were obtained from Laboratory Animal Unit, University of Hong Kong (HKU). All experiments were performed in a Biosafety Level-3 animal facility, LKS Facility of Medicine, HKU. The study has been approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research, HKU. Virus stock (isolate HKG/13_P2/2020 (MT835140)) was diluted with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to 2 × 104 PFU/ml. Syrian hamsters were obtained from the LASEC, Chinese University of Hong Kong via the Centre for Comparative Medicine Research at the University of Hong Kong. Hamsters were anesthetized with ketamine (150mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/mg) and then intranasally inoculation with 50 ul of diluted viruses containing 10 3 PFU of viruses. For drug treatments, 10mg/kg TPT resuspended in vehicle [5% DMSO + 5% corn oil in PBS] or vehicle alone was administered intraperitoneally to animals on the indicated days post infection.
For experiments shown in Figure S4 , infection procedures were performed following protocols approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. 7-10 week old (∼120-140 g) female Golden Syrian hamsters (Charles River) were anesthetized using 90mg/kg Ketamine and 2mg/kg Xylazine by intraperitoneal injection. Once anesthetized, hamsters were intransally infected with 1E5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281)) re-suspended in 100ul of PBS. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of illness and weight loss after infection. For drug treatments, 2mg/kg TPT resuspended in vehicle [4.5% DMSO + 20% Sulfobutylether-β-Cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) in PBS] or vehicle alone was administered intraperitoneally to animals on the indicated days post infection.
All mice infection procedures were performed following protocols approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. 5-10 week old female B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J (K18-hACE2) mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 90mg/kg Ketamine and 2 mg/kg xylazine. Once anesthetized, mice were infected with 1E4 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281)) suspended in 30ul of PBS. Mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of illness and weight loss after infection. Animals that reached 80% bodyweight or clinical signs that are irrevocably linked with death were humanely euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of 60mg/kg pentobarbital.
For drug treatments, 2mg/kg Topotecan-hydrochloride (TPT; 14129, Cayman Chemical Company) re-suspended in vehicle [4.5% DMSO + 20% Sulfobutylether-β-Cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) in PBS] was administered intraperitoneally to animals on the indicated days post infection.
Upon euthanasia, the superior lobe of infected hACE2-KI mice or Golden Syrian hamsters were collected for RNA extraction. Lungs were lysed and homogenized in Trizol. RNA extraction was performed using the Purelink RNA Mini Kit with a DNaseI treatment step, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher).
For histological slides shown in Figures 3 E–3H, Lung left superior lobes of infected Golden Syrian hamster were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then processed for paraffin embedding. The 4μm tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination. Images were with Olympus BX53 semi-motorized fluorescence microscope using cellSens imaging software.
For histological slides shown in Figures S4 D and S4E, the left lung lobe of infected Golden Syrian hamsters was fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours. Embedding in paraffin blocks and staining with H&E were conducted by the Biorepository and Pathology Dean’s CoRE at the the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Microscopic sections were analyzed in a blinded fashion by the same pathologist (A.M.). A number was randomly assigned by the investigator to discriminate each section, which was then submitted for analysis. No information about treatments and mouse genotypes was communicated to the pathologist. Lungs were scored by the area involved in broncho-pneumonia.
We combined PCHi-C ( Schoenfelder et al., 2015 63. Schoenfelder, S. ∙ Furlan-Magaril, M. ∙ Mifsud, B. ... The pluripotent regulatory circuitry connecting promoters to their long-range interacting elements Genome Res. 2015; 25 :582-597 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Hi-C library generation as described previously ( Nagano et al., 2017 52. Nagano, T. ∙ Lubling, Y. ∙ Várnai, C. ... Cell-cycle dynamics of chromosomal organization at single-cell resolution Nature. 2017; 547 :61-67 Crossref Scopus (481) PubMed Google Scholar ), with some modifications. Cells were fixed in 2% PFA for 10 minutes, lysed in lysis buffer (30 minutes on ice), and digested with DpnII (NEB) overnight at 37C rotating (950rpm). Restriction overhangs were filled-in with Klenow (NEB) using biotin-14-dATP (Jena Bioscience), and ligation was performed in ligation buffer for 4 hours at 16C (T4 DNA ligase; Life Technologies). After overnight decrosslinking at 65C, the ligated DNA was tagmented to produce fragments of 300-700 bp range. Ligation products were isolated using MyOne C1 streptavidin beads (Life Technologies), followed by washing with Wash&Binding buffer and nuclease-free water. Isolated Hi-C ligation products on the beads were then used directly for PCR amplification, and the final Hi-C library was purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Promoter Capture Hi-C was performed using a custom-design Agilent SureSelect system following the manufacturer’s protocol.
For quantification of viral titers in the lungs tissues of infected animals, the middle, inferior and post-caval lobes of infected mice/hamsters were collected and homogenized in 1ml of ice-cold PBS. Lysates were then centrifuged at 10000rpm for 5min to remove cellular debris, and the cleared lysates transferred to new tubes. Lysates were then diluted in 10-fold dilutions 6 times. Quantification of infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers was then performed by plaque assays. Briefly, Vero-E6 cells were plated as confluent monolayers in 12 well dishes. Media was removed, and wells washed in 1ml of PBS. 200ul of diluted lysates was then added per well and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at 37°C. After viral adsorption, lysates were removed from the well and cells were overlaid with Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 2% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 0.12% NaHCO3 and 0.7% agar. 72h post infection, agar plugs were fixed in 10% formalin for 24h before being removed. Plaques were visualized by immune staining with anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein antibodies (mAb 1C7) for 1 hour at RTP followed by anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (abcam) for 1 hour at RTP after 3 washes in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20. Plaques were then developed using the TrueBlue substrate (KPL-Seracare) and viral titers calculated and expressed as PFU/ml
Microneutralization assays were performed as previously described ( Amanat et al., 2020 1. Amanat, F. ∙ Stadlbauer, D. ∙ Strohmeier, S. ... A serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1033-1036 Crossref Scopus (1204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded at a density of 20,000 cells per well in a 96-well cell culture plate in complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (cDMEM). The following day, heat-inactivated serum samples (dilution of 1:10) were serially diluted threefold in 1 × MEM (10% 10 × minimal essential medium (GIBCO), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1% sodium bicarbonate (wt/vol; GIBCO), 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; GIBCO), 100 U ml–1 penicillin, 100 ug/ml–1 streptomycin (GIBCO) and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (MP Biomedicals)). Then, 80 μl of each serum dilution and 80 μl of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, diluted to a concentration of 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) were added to a 96-well cell culture plate and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Media was then removed from the Vero E6 cells, and 120ul of the virus-serum mixture added to each well. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Virus-serum mixture was then removed from the cells, and 100ul of each corresponding serum dilution and 100ul of 1X MEM/1%FBS added back to each well. Cells were incubated for 48h at 37 °C before being fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 24h at 4°C. After fixation, formaldehyde was removed, and cells were washed with 200ul PBS, before being permeabilized with 150ul PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 15min. Plates were then washed three times with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked in 3% Milk/PBST for 1h at RTP. 100ul of 1:1000 diluted mAb 1C7 iwas then added to each well. Plates were incubated for a further 1h at RTP. After incubation, plates were wash 3 times with PBST, before anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:3000 in 3% milk) was added to the well. Plates were incubated for a further 1 hour at RTP, before being washed 3 times with PBST. Finally, SIGMAFAST OPD (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to wells. The reaction was stopped after 10 min through the addition of 50ul 3M HCl. OD490 was then measured on a Synergy 4 plate reader (BioTek). Concentrations of antibodies in serum were blank normalized and curve-fitted to calculate IC 50 using Graphpad prism 8.0.
1E5 A549-ACE2 cells were plated in a 24 well dishes 16h prior to infection. For infection, cells were then mock infected (PBS only) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 2. TPT was added to a final concentration of 100nM or 500nM. DMSO controls were also included. 8 and 24 hours post infection, media was removed, and cells were lysed in 250ul of Trizol reagent (Thermo Scientific). Uninfected and drug treated cells were also infected as controls. RNA was then extracted using the Purelink RNA Minikit (Invitrogen) with DNaseI treatment, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Viral isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was used in these experiments.
THP1 cells were plated in 48 well dishes. For purified viral RNA (vRNA) treatment, THP1 cells were transfected with 1ug purified SARS-CoV-2 (isolate HKG/13_P2/2020 (MT835140)) vRNA using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For supernatant treated cells, media of THP1 cells was replaced with conditioned media from infected cells. At 6 hours post treatment (either by vRNA transfection or conditioned media), remaining media was removed from THP1 cells, and cells were lysed in Trizol. RNA was then extracted according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. To make conditioned media, Calu-3 cells were infected with 0.1 MOI SAR-CoV-2 (HKG/13_P2/2020 (MT835140)). At 72hpi, supernatant was collected and filtered using YM100 Amicon Ultra Filter to remove residual viruses. Filtered supernatants were then used for downstream assays.
Experiments were performed as previously described ( Gordon et al., 2020 20. Gordon, D.E. ∙ Jang, G.M. ∙ Bouhaddou, M. ... A SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map reveals targets for drug repurposing Nature. 2020; 583 :459-468 Crossref Scopus (3035) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 24h hours prior to the assay, 2000 Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 96 well plates and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Medium was replaced 2 hours before infection with DMEM (2% FBS) media containing drugs of interest at different doses and at concentrations 50% greater than those indicated. Cells were then infected with 100 PFU (MOI = 0.025) SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281)) in 50ul, bringing the final drug concentration to those indicated. Plates were then incubated for 48h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Supernatants were then removed and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24h. To determine % of infected cells, cells were stained for NP protein (1° antibody: anti-sera produced in the García -Sastre laboratory; 1:10,000; 2° antibody: anti-rabbit Alexa flour 488nM) and a DAPI counterstain. Infected cells were visualized and quantified using the Celigo (Nexcelcom) imaging cytometer. Accumulation of viral NP protein in the nucleus was used as a proxy for infectivity. The percentage of infected cells per well was quantified as ((infected cells/total cells) − background) × 100 and the DMSO control was then set to 100% infection for analysis. The IC 50 was then determined using Graphpad Prism 8.0 software by performing a non linear regression (inhibitor versus response) curve fit. To measure cytotoxicity of drugs, MTT assays (Roche) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These assays were performed in uninfected Vero-E6 cells using the same concentrations of drugs, and performed concurrently with viral replication assays. All assays were performed in biologically independent triplicates.
Mice were randomly assigned into treatment groups. Statistical significance between survival curves was calculated using a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using Graphpad Prism 8.0 software. Differences in weight loss curves were determined using a Two-Way Mixed Model ANOVA in Graphpad Prism 8.0 Software. Data are shown as ± SEM. To determine effects of drug treatment on morbidity, the maximum weight lost for each mouse in each condition was tabulated, Mice were grouped by those that had a maximum weight loss of either > 15% or ≤ 15%. Differences in percentages of mice falling in these two groups under late TPT treatment or DMSO vehicle control treatment was then calculated using a Fisher’s Exact Test in Graphpad Prism 8.0 software.
The following primers were used for qPCR: [Human] HPRT1 F: TGCTGAGGATTTGGAAAGGG, HPRT1 R: ACAGAGGGCTACAATGTGATG, CXCL8 F: ATACTCCAAACCTTTCCACCC, CXCL8 R: TCTGCACCCAGTTTTCCTTG, CXCL3 F: AAGTGTGAATGTAAGGTCCCC, CXCL3 R: GTGCTCCCCTTGTTCAGTATC, CXCL2 F: AACCGAAGTCATAGCCACAC, CXCL2 R: CTTCTGGTCAGTTGGATTTGC, IL6 F: ACTCACCTCTTCAGAACGAATTG, IL6 R: CCATCTTTGGAAGGTTCAGGTTG, TNFAIP3 F: GATAGAAATCCCCGTCCAAGG, TNFAIP3 R: CTGCCATTTCTTGTACTCATGC, EGR1 F: TGTCACCAACTCCTTCAGC, EGR1 R: TCCTGTCCTTTAAGTCTCTTGTG, CXCL10 F: CXCL10 R CXCL11 F CXCL11 R: [Mouse] Hprt F: GGCCAGACTTTGTTGGATTTG, Hprt R: CGCTCATCTTAGGCTTTGTATTTG Ccr8 F: AGTGGGCAGCTCTGAAAC, Ccr8 R: GCTCCATCGTGTAATCCATCG, Il10 F: AGCCGGGAAGACAATAACTG, Il10 R: GGAGTCGGTTAGCAGTATGTTG, Arg1 F: AAGAATGGAAGAGTCAGTGTGG, Arg1 R: GGGAGTGTTGATGTCAGTGTG, Ccr2 F: GCTCTACATTCACTCCTTCCAC, Ccr2 R: ACCACTGTCTTTGAGGCTTG, Ccl5 F: GGGTACCATGAAGATCTCTGC, Ccl5 R: TCTAGGGAGAGGTAGGCAAAG, Ccr5 F: TCCAGCAAGACAATCCTGATC, Ccr5 R: AACCATTCCTACTCCCAAGC [Hamster] Tbp F: CCCTTGTACCCTTCACCTATG, Tbp R: ACATCCAAGATTCACCGTGG, Ccl5 F: GCAAGGAAAGCAAATGGAGAC, Ccl5 R: GTGCTGGTTTCTTGGGTTTG, Ccr5 F: GACATCTACCTGCTCAACCTG, Ccr5 R: AACCAATGTGATAGAGCCCTG, Ccr1 F: CTCCTTCTCAGAGTTGTCACAG, Ccr1 R: GCACAAGACACAGAACACAAG, Ccl4 F: TCCTGACCAGAAAAGGCAAG, Ccl4 R: AGCTCAGTTCAACTCCAAGTC. qPCR assays performed for the quantification of gene expression in the in vitro models were done in 3 biological replicates. Expression of genes of interest were normalized to that of a housekeeping gene using the comparative Cq method, where using the comparative Cq method: 2−ΔCq, where ΔCq = Cq Target gene - Cq Housekeeping gene. For human samples either HPRT1 or ACTB was used as a housekeeping gene. For mouse and hamster samples, Hprt and Tbp were used respectively. Where samples were normalized to mock infected samples, ΔCq of infected replicates were exponentially transformed to 2ˆ-ΔCq before being averaged and the standard deviation determined. The mean of infected samples was then compared to that of the corresponding uninfected (mock treated samples), such that the final ratio of ΔCq Infected / ΔCq Uninfected was determined. This method takes into account effects associated with experimental treatment. Statistical significance in gene expression was estimated with Graphpad Prism 8.0 software, and determined using two-tailed Student’s t test under the assumption of equal variances between groups. Data are shown as ± SD.
qPCR assays performed for gene expression analysis in the lungs of infected animals were done with 3-4 biological replicates (3-4 infected animals/condition). Expression of genes of interest were normalized to that of a housekeeping gene using the comparative Cq method, where using the relative Cq method: 2−ΔCq, where ΔCq = Cq Target gene - Cq Housekeeping gene. Statistical significance in gene expression was estimated with Graphpad Prism 8.0 software, and determined using one or two-tailed Student’s t test under the assumption of equal variances between groups. Tests used are indicated in the legends. Data are shown as ± SEM.
After adaptor removal with cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 45. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet.journal. 2011; 17 :3 Crossref Google Scholar ) and base-quality trimming to remove 3′read sequences if more than 20 bases with Q < 20 were present, paired-end reads were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 and human (hg38) or hamster ( Mesocricetus auratus ; MesAur1.0) reference genomes with STAR. Gene-count summaries were generated with featureCounts ( Liao et al., 2014 37. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (13451) PubMed Google Scholar ). A numeric matrix of raw read counts was generated, with genes in rows and samples in columns, and used for differential gene expression analysis with the Bioconductor Limma package ( Ritchie et al., 2015 60. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21729) PubMed Google Scholar ) after removing genes with less than 50 total reads across all samples or of less than 200 nucleotides in length. Normalization factors were computed on the filtered data matrix using the weighted trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method, followed by voom ( Law et al., 2014 33. Law, C.W. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Shi, W. ... voom: Precision weights unlock linear model analysis tools for RNA-seq read counts Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :R29 Crossref Scopus (3657) PubMed Google Scholar ) mean-variance transformation in preparation for Limma linear modeling. To specifically identify the effect of siRNA mediated TOP1 depletion on the inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 in A549-ACE2 cells shown in Figure 2 , we used interaction model (siTOP1_Infected:siTOP_uninfected - siSCR_Infected:siSCR_uninfected or no_siRNA_infected:no_siRNA:uninfected - siSCR_Infected:siSCR_uninfected), that takes into account basal differences between conditions. Gene ontology analysis were performed with clusterProfiler ( Yu et al., 2012 76. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (18538) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify TPT dependent gene expression changes in infected hamsters showin in Figure 3 , we performed pairwise contrast between experimental groups (i.e: TPT D4 – DMSO D4; TPT D6 – DMSO D6). Pairwise comparisons were then performed between treatment groups and eBayes adjusted P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamin-Hochberg (BH) method and used to select genes with significant expression differences (fold change > 1.5, adjusted P value < 0.05). For gene ontology analysis in hamsters, hamster gene ids were converted to available human orthologs using ENSEMBL, and inputted into clusterProfiler ( Yu et al., 2012 76. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (18538) PubMed Google Scholar ) program in R.
We identified TOP1 inhibitor gene signatures from TPT-treated Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. We defined the up- and downregulated signatures as genes differentially expressed after 4 or 6 days of treatment (log2|FC| > 1, FDR = 10%). We converted hamster genes to available human orthologs using ENSEMBL (Release 101). We downloaded normalized transcript expression from targeted RNA-seq (398 genes) on lung autopsy tissue from COVID19 patients (16 patients, 34 samples), normal lung tissue (6 patients, 17 samples), and lung tissue from from bacterial or viral pneumonia (4 patients, 5 samples) ( Nienhold et al., 2020 55. Nienhold, R. ∙ Ciani, Y. ∙ Koelzer, V.H. ... Two distinct immunopathological profiles in autopsy lungs of COVID-19 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5086 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ; GEO accession: GSE151764 ). Gene set enrichment analysis ( Subramanian et al., 2005 69. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33620) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed using the R package fgsea ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 30. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; 060012 Google Scholar ). We used Tukey’s multiple comparison test to identify significant differences in mean normalized enrichment scores.
For gene set enrichment analysis of lung-cell-type gene, we downloaded UMI counts of single-cell RNA-seq of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with moderate and severe COVID19, along with healthy controls ( Liao et al., 2020 38. Liao, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Yuan, J. ... Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :842-844 Crossref Scopus (1710) PubMed Google Scholar ). We removed a sample from a patient with severe COVID19 identified to be co-infected with HPMV ( Bost et al., 2020 8. Bost, P. ∙ Giladi, A. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Host-Viral Infection Maps Reveal Signatures of Severe COVID-19 Patients Cell. 2020; 181 :1475-1488.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ). We removed cell doublets from individual patient samples using DoubletFinder ( McGinnis et al., 2019 47. McGinnis, C.S. ∙ Murrow, L.M. ∙ Gartner, Z.J. DoubletFinder: Doublet Detection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Using Artificial Nearest Neighbors Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :329-337.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ). We integrated patient samples using canonical correlation analysis in Seurat ( Stuart et al., 2019 68. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e1821 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7328) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We aggregated UMI counts for each cell-type from each patient sample, keeping ”pseudo-bulk” samples mad up of at least 10 cells. Pseudo-bulk counts were robustly normalized with DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 41. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48497) PubMed Google Scholar )and gene expression was Z-scored across cells. We performed GSEA ( Subramanian et al., 2005 69. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33620) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the R package fgsea ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 30. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; 060012 Google Scholar ).
ChIP-seq datasets were processed and analyzed using an in-house automated pipeline ( https://github.com/MarioPujato/NextGenAligner ). Briefly, basic quality control for raw sequencing reads was performed using FASTQC (version 0.11.2) ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc ). Adaptor sequences were removed using Trim Galore (version 0.4.2) ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ ), a wrapper script that
runs cutadapt (version 1.9.1) to remove the detected adaptor sequence from the reads. The quality-controlled reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19/GRCh37) using bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.1) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 32. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33805) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aligned reads were then sorted using samtools (version 1.8) ( Li et al., 2009 36. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38872) PubMed Google Scholar ) and duplicate reads were removed using picard (version 1.89) ( https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ). Peaks were called using MACS2 (version 2.1.0) ( https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS ) ( Zhang et al., 2008 78. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (10897) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the control/input aligned reads as background (callpeak -g hs -q 0.01 –broad -c input/control). ENCODE blacklist regions ( Amemiya et al., 2019 2. Amemiya, H.M. ∙ Kundaje, A. ∙ Boyle, A.P. The ENCODE Blacklist: Identification of Problematic Regions of the Genome Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :9354 Crossref Scopus (722) PubMed Google Scholar ) were removed using the hg19-blacklist.v2.bed.gz file available at https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/tree/master/lists .
The ChIP-seq experimental design consisted of triplicates experiments for each condition (0hr, 8hr, 24hr infections). PCA analysis indicating strong agreement between experimental replicates and clear separation between conditions ( Figure S1 A) Sequencing reads from replicates were thus combined, and alignment and peak calling was again performed as described above. For differential peak analysis, the union set of all peaks from these three conditions was generated using bedtools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 57. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15115) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each of the resulting genomic regions, read counts were obtained for all 9 replicates. These read counts used as input to DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 41. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48497) PubMed Google Scholar ). A fold change cutoff of greater than or equal to 1.5 and an FDR-corrected p value cutoff of less than or equal to 0.05 were used to identify differential peaks for each pairwise comparison between conditions.
We used the HOMER suite of tools ( Heinz et al., 2010 23. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8027) PubMed Google Scholar ), modified to use a log base two scoring system and to include the large set of human motifs contained in the CisBP database (build 2.0) ( Lambert et al., 2019 31. Lambert, S.A. ∙ Yang, A.W.H. ∙ Sasse, A. ... Similarity regression predicts evolution of transcription factor sequence specificity Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :981-989 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify enriched motifs within the sequences of differential and shared ChIP-seq peaks. To minimize redundancy, motifs were grouped into classes using the following procedure. Each human transcription factor was assigned the single best p value obtained for any of its corresponding motifs. Transcription factors with identical best motifs were merged then into a single class.
Hi-C data was processed as described in Heinz et al. (2018) 24. Heinz, S. ∙ Texari, L. ∙ Hayes, M.G.B. ... Transcription Elongation Can Affect Genome 3D Structure Cell. 2018; 174 :1522-1536.e1522 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, Hi-C reads were trimmed at MboI/DpnII recognition sites (GATC) and aligned to the human genome (GRCh38/hg38) using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 17. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27081) PubMed Google Scholar ), keeping only read pairs that both map to unique genomic locations for further analysis (MAPQ > 10). All PCR duplicates were also removed. PCA analysis of Hi-C experiments used to define chromatin compartments were performed with HOMER ( Lin et al., 2012 39. Lin, Y.C. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Mansson, R. ... Global changes in the nuclear positioning of genes and intra- and interdomain genomic interactions that orchestrate B cell fate Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :1196-1204 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each chromosome, a balanced and distance normalized contact matrix was generated using window size of 50 kb sampled every 25 kb, reporting the ratios of observed to expected contact frequencies for any two regions. The correlation coefficient of the interaction profiles for any two regions across the entire chromosome were then calculated to generate a correlation matrix (also visualized in Figure 1 A). This matrix was then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from the prcomp function in R ( https://www.r-project.org ), and the eigenvector loadings for each 25 kb region along the first principal component were assigned to each region (PC1 values). The PC1 values from each chromosome were scaled by their standard deviation to make them more comparable across chromosomes and analysis parameters. For each chromosome, PC1 values are multiplied by −1 if negative PC1 regions are more strongly enriched for active chromatin regions defined by H3K27ac peaks to ensure the positive PC1 values align with the A/permissive compartment (as opposed to the B/inert compartment). chrY was excluded from the PCA analysis due to its small size and high repeat content. Balanced, normalized Hi-C contact maps were generated at 25 kb resolution for visualization ( Figure 1 A). Assignment of PC1 values to Gencode gene promoters and other features was performed using HOMER’s annotatePeaks.pl function using the results from the PCA analysis.
Sequencing data from three biological replicates of PCHi-C at each of the three time points were aligned and quality-controlled with HiCUP ( Wingett et al., 2015 73. Wingett, S. ∙ Ewels, P. ∙ Furlan-Magaril, M. ... HiCUP: pipeline for mapping and processing Hi-C data F1000Res. 2015; 4 :1310 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). DpnII fragment-level reads were pooled over consecutive fragments over the total length of at least 5k, except for the baited promoter fragments that were left unbinned. To achieve a balanced dataset for the analysis of promoter interaction dynamics across time points, sequencing data for each replicate were subsampled to a similar number of HiCUP-processed valid captured reads per time point. Significant interactions were then detected for each time point jointly across the replicates by CHiCAGO ( Cairns et al., 2016 9. Cairns, J. ∙ Freire-Pritchett, P. ∙ Wingett, S.W. ... CHiCAGO: robust detection of DNA looping interactions in Capture Hi-C data Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :127 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ), with minNPerBait set to 90 and all other parameters left at defaults.
A peak matrix was generated listing the CHiCAGO scores at each time point for all interactions that exceeded a CHiCAGO score cutoff of 5 in at least one time point. K-means clustering was used to partition the peak matrix into 7 clusters based on arcsinh-transformed CHiCAGO scores, corresponding to interactions detected in a single time point (“0h,” “8h,” “24h”), two time points (“0+8hpi,” “0+24hpi,” “8+24hpi”) or all time points (“0+8+24hpi”). To minimize the impact of false-negative calls at each time point on cluster assignment, we additionally called interactions in each full-sized single replicate and filtered the above clusters to remove interactions that had CHiCAGO scores above 3 in any single replicate/time point, for which the corresponding cluster was negative (e.g., interactions in the 0hpi cluster were filtered out if they had scores > 3 in any of the single-replicate 8hpi or 24hpi calls, etc.). This filtered interaction set was then curated based on their k-means cluster assignment into three categories: lost (“0hpi” and “0+8h”), retained (the “0+8+24hpi” cluster) and gained (“8+24hpi” and “24hpi”), respectively, upon infection.
To assess the relationship between H3K27ac dynamics and changes in promoter-enhancer interactions at 0 versus 24 hpi, we used Fisher’s test on 3x3 contingency tables between the “lost” (log2FC < −2; padj < 0.05), “constant” (padj > 0.1; baseMean > 50) and “gained” (log2FC > 2; padj < 0.05) H3K27ac peaks and the promoter interaction categories defined as above. Interactions without H3K27ac ChIP peaks at PIRs at either 0 or 24 hpi were removed from the analysis. Results were presented as heatmaps, with each combination of expression and promoter interaction category color-coded by the log-odds ratio (LORs) for the given versus the other two expression and promoter interaction categories combined, respectively. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the LORs were computed based on Fisher’s exact test, with LORs whose CIs cross zero greyed out on the heatmaps.
To assess the relationship between gene expression dynamics and change in the number of connected active enhancers, we used the same promoter interaction and H3K27ac dynamics categories, and additionally classified genes into “down” (log2FC < 1, padj < 0.05), “neutral” (|log2FC < 0.5|, padj > 0.2) and “up” (log2FC > 1, padj < 0.05) at 24 versus 0 hpi. For each gene, change in the number of connected active enhancers C was computed as follows: C = #(retained interactions with gained H3K27ac peaks) + #(gained interactions with gained H3K27ac peaks) + #(gained interactions with constant H3K27ac peaks) – #(retained interactions with lost H3K27ac peaks) – #(lost interactions with lost H3K27ac peaks) – #(lost interactions with constant H3K27ac peaks).
Genes were partitioned into three categories based on this quantity: “ reduced” ( C < 0), “constant” ( C = 0), “increased” ( C > 0). The relationship between these categories and the gene expression category (“down,” “neutral,” “up”) was probed and visualized using 3x3 contingency tables in the same manner as above.
