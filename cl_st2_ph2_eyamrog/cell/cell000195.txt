Title: Loss of Bcl-6-Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and Germinal Centers in COVID-19


Abstract: Summary

Humoral responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are often of limited durability, as seen with other human coronavirus epidemics. To address the underlying etiology, we examined post mortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers and a striking reduction in Bcl-6 + germinal center B cells but preservation of AID + B cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6 + T FH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet + T H1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-α accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific “disease-related” B cell populations. These data identify defective Bcl-6 + T FH cell generation and dysregulated humoral immune induction early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic explanation for the limited durability of antibody responses in coronavirus infections, and suggest that achieving herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult.

Section: Introduction

Adaptive immunity is initiated in secondary lymphoid organs and is influenced by the milieu generated by the initial activation of the innate immune system. Longitudinal studies on humoral immunity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as studies in convalescent subjects indicate that humoral immunity is often short lived and that most SARS-CoV-2 antibodies exhibit limited somatic hypermutation ( Brouwer et al., 2020 2. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ...

Understanding how the adaptive immune system is modulated in severe COVID-19 disease thus requires interrogation of secondary lymphoid organs in the acute phase of infection, where these responses are generated, but most studies to date have largely focused on peripheral blood samples.
SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic to rapidly fatal, but the reasons for this heterogeneity are not known. Severely ill patients experience a life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even in an advanced care setting, some patients sustain severe lung damage and succumb early ( Zhu et al., 2020 48. Zhu, N. ∙ Zhang, D. ∙ Wang, W. ..., China Novel Coronavirus Investigating and Research Team A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :727-733 Crossref Scopus (18842) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 47. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.L. ∙ Wang, X.G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14580) PubMed Google Scholar ). Virus is found in the lungs and airways early in infection, but not as the disease progresses ( Schaefer et al., 2020 37. Schaefer, I.M. ∙ Padera, R.F. ∙ Solomon, I.H. ... In situ detection of SARS-CoV-2 in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19 Mod. Pathol. 2020; 19 :1-11 Google Scholar ). Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by infected pneumocytes likely combine with viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to activate innate immunity ( Vardhana and Wolchok, 2020 39. Vardhana, S.A. ∙ Wolchok, J.D. The many faces of the anti-COVID immune response J Exp Med. 2020; 217 :e20200678 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The cytokine milieu thus generated would be predicted to influence the induction of lymphocyte activation by antigen conveyed directly in the lymph or by dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes. Viremia likely also leads to the initiation of immune responses in the spleen.
Many of the features of severe human coronavirus disease in COVID-19 and in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are strikingly similar. Progressive lymphopenia has been described in SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Guan et al., 2020 10. Guan, W.J. ∙ Ni, Z.Y. ∙ Hu, Y. ..., China Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19 Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :1708-1720 Crossref Scopus (20504) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the degree of lymphopenia has been correlated with increases in circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 ( Zhang et al., 2020 45. Zhang, X. ∙ Tan, Y. ∙ Ling, Y. ... Viral and host factors related to the clinical outcome of COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 583 :437-440 Crossref Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lymphopenia was also observed in SARS at the peak of active disease, which was also characterized by cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress ( Perlman and Dandekar, 2005 29. Perlman, S. ∙ Dandekar, A.A. Immunopathogenesis of coronavirus infections: implications for SARS Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5 :917-927 Crossref Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autopsy studies in SARS showed atrophy of lymphoid organs, including lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer’s patches, and loss of germinal centers ( Gu et al., 2005 9. Gu, J. ∙ Gong, E. ∙ Zhang, B. ... Multiple organ infection and the pathogenesis of SARS J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202 :415-424 Crossref Scopus (1078) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autopsy studies in COVID-19 have also identified splenic white pulp atrophy ( Xu et al., 2020 44. Xu, X. ∙ Chang, X.N. ∙ Pan, H.X. ...

Pathol. 2020; 48 :107233 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ) and lymphocyte depletion in spleen and lymph nodes ( Lax et al., 2020 18. Lax, S.F. ∙ Skok, K. ∙ Zechner, P. ... Pulmonary arterial thrombosis in COVID-19 with fatal outcome: results from a prospective, single-center, clinicopathologic case series Ann. Intern. Med. 2020; Published online May 14, 2020 Crossref Scopus (580) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, numerous viral and non-viral infections do give rise to cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress, and lymphopenia ( Tisoncik et al., 2012 38. Tisoncik, J.R. ∙ Korth, M.J. ∙ Simmons, C.P. ... Into the eye of the cytokine storm Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2012; 76 :16-32 Crossref Scopus (1377) PubMed Google Scholar ). Splenic white pulp atrophy has also been histo-pathologically demonstrated in Ebola and Marburg disease ( Martines et al., 2015 24. Martines, R.B. ∙ Ng, D.L. ∙ Greer, P.W. ... Tissue and cellular tropism, pathology and pathogenesis of Ebola and Marburg viruses J. Pathol. 2015; 235 :153-174 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rippey et. al., 1984 33. Rippey, J.J. ∙ Schepers, N.J. ∙ Gear, J.H. The pathology of Marburg virus disease S. Afr. Med. J. 1984; 66 :50-54 PubMed Google Scholar ) and in H5N1 influenza ( Gao et al., 2010 8. Gao, R. ∙ Dong, L. ∙ Dong, J. ... A systematic molecular pathology study of a laboratory confirmed H5N1 human case PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e13315 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2008 21. Lu, M. ∙ Xie, Z.G. ∙ Gao, Z.C. ... [Histopathologic study of avian influenza H5N1 infection in humans] Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2008; 37 :145-149 PubMed Google Scholar ). These data, taken together, suggest that many different viral and infectious triggers can contribute to a similar constellation of immunological phenomena that may drive pathology.
In persons with COVID-19, the magnitude and durability of antibody responses are greater in those with more severe disease ( Ju et al., 2020 12. Ju, B. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Ge, J. ... Human neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection Nature. 2020; 584 :115-119 Crossref Scopus (1174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Amanat et al., 2020 1.

Med. 2020; 26 :1033-1036 Crossref Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ) but are often of low magnitude ( Robbiani et al., 2020 34. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ) and appear to lack durability ( Long et al., 2020 20. Long, Q.X. ∙ Liu, B.Z. ∙ Deng, H.J. ... Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :845-848 Crossref Scopus (2078) PubMed Google Scholar ). This may be similar to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), where humoral responses were generally not durable except in a subset of individuals ( Mo et al., 2006 26. Mo, H. ∙ Zeng, G. ∙ Ren, X. ... Longitudinal profile of antibodies against SARS-coronavirus in SARS patients and their clinical significance Respirology. 2006; 11 :49-53 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zumla et al., 2015 49. Zumla, A. ∙ Hui, D.S. ∙ Perlman, S. Middle East respiratory syndrome Lancet. 2015; 386 :995-1007 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (857) PubMed Google Scholar ). Impaired infection-induced protective immunity has also been documented by repeated infections with the human coronaviruses CoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 in patients with less severe respiratory tract infections ( Galanti et al., 2019 7. Galanti, M. ∙ Birger, R. ∙ Ud-Dean, M. ... Longitudinal active sampling for respiratory viral infections across age groups Influenza Other Respir. Viruses. 2019; 13 :226-232 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reinfection could be possibly attributed to viral strain subtypes, but the reason/s for the general lack of durable humoral immune responses to coronaviruses has never been established.
A better understanding of alterations to components of the humoral immune system, especially in secondary lymphoid organs, provides an opportunity to decipher why natural infections with coronaviruses often do not provide durable immunity. A granular analysis of B and T lymphocytes in draining lymph nodes and spleens of SARS or MERS patients was never reported, leaving the underlying basis for the lymphopenia and the general lack of durability of antibody responses in those diseases unresolved. Because COVID-19 disease most significantly affects the lungs, we undertook an analysis of thoracic lymph nodes, examining lymphoid architecture and lymphocyte populations using multi-color immunofluorescence, multispectral imaging, and cell-cell interaction analyses from the time of disease onset in persons with diverse disease outcomes. Given that viremia has been observed in this illness ( Zheng et al., 2020 46. Zheng, S. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Yu, F. ... Viral load dynamics and disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Zhejiang province, China, January-March 2020: retrospective cohort study BMJ. 2020; 369 :m1443 Crossref Scopus (1093) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lescure et al., 2020 19. Lescure, F.X. ∙ Bouadma, L. ∙ Nguyen, D. ... Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series Lancet Infect. Dis. 2020; 20 :697-706 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also interrogated spleens both in the acute- and late-disease settings and complemented these studies with examination of peripheral blood samples in a separate cohort, wherein convalescence could also be studied. Our results identify a striking absence of lymph node and splenic germinal centers and Bcl-6-expressing B cells, defective Bcl-6 + T follicular helper cell generation and differentiation, and dysregulated SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic explanation for the limited durability of humoral immunity and the less robust somatic hypermutation seen in this disease following natural infection.

Section: Results

We have used a human-tissue-imaging platform with quantitative high-resolution automated slide-scanning microscopy, exploiting both regular and confocal approaches and multispectral imaging, in order to interrogate human lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs at the single-cell level. These approaches crucially preserve architecture over broad swaths of tissue. Thoracic lymph nodes in severely ill COVID-19 patients who succumbed in less than 8 days after admission (the group designated “early”; less than 10 days from the onset of respiratory symptoms; Table S1 ) displayed a lack of germinal centers, and these were also absent in those who succumbed later (15–36 days after admission, categorized as “late”; Figures 1 A and 1B). Controls were thoracic lymph nodes from age-matched individuals who succumbed from non-COVID-19 causes ( Table S2 ). Quantitation revealed dramatic early loss of both B and T cells, absolute numbers declining to about one-third of their non-COVID-19 controls, and this persisted in late disease ( Figures 1 D and 1E), though distinct T and B cell zones could always be clearly discerned. Human control lymph nodes contain germinal centers possibly because of ongoing adaptive immunity initiated by commensal antigens. The absence of germinal centers in the thoracic lymph nodes of acutely ill COVID-19 patients in whose lungs we have already described very high viral loads ( Schaefer et al., 2020 37. Schaefer, I.M. ∙ Padera, R.F. ∙ Solomon, I.H. ... In situ detection of SARS-CoV-2 in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19 Mod. Pathol. 2020; 19 :1-11 Google Scholar ) was particularly surprising.
Bcl-6-expressing germinal center B cells were also markedly reduced in COVID-19, but there was a preservation of AID-expressing B cells, although these were diffusely distributed compared to controls ( Figures 1 C, 1F, and 1G).
Analysis of spleens in this same group of COVID-19 patients also revealed a preponderance of red pulp and paucity of white pulp ( Figures 2 A and 2B), a marked reduction in B and T cell numbers ( Figures 2 B, 2D, and 2E), and a marked reduction in Bcl-6 + germinal center B cells ( Figures 2 C and 2F). There was, however, very clear and quantitative preservation of AID + B cells in both early and late splenic tissue ( Figures 2 C and 2G). Importantly, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) were present in both lymph nodes and spleen in these patients, indicating that the lack of these cells was not contributing to the lack of germinal center B cells ( Figure S1 ). Together, these data indicate that, early in severe COVID-19 disease, even within 10 days of the onset of respiratory symptoms, there is severe attrition in B and T cell numbers and a striking reduction in Bcl-6 + B cells in lymph nodes and the spleen and the loss of germinal centers. Interestingly, AID + B cells are preserved, indicating that activated helper T cells are still likely to be in frequent contact with antigen-specific B cells.
To better understand the absence of germinal centers in COVID-19, we explored the possibility that the tissue milieu might contribute to defective T follicular helper cell differentiation. In both the lymph nodes and spleen, in early as well as late disease, CD4 + ICOS + T FH cells were diminished ( Figures 3 A, 3C, 3E, and 3G) and CD4 + CXCR5 + T FH cells were present but reduced in numbers ( Figure S2 ), but the decrease in CD4 + Bcl-6 + germinal center type T FH (GC-T FH ) cells was striking ( Figures 3 B, 3D, 3F, and 3H). Tissue quantitation confirmed significant differences for both early and late disease compared to controls. Because these changes were seen both in thoracic lymph nodes and in the spleen, these data are consistent with the view that circulating factors in severely ill COVID-19 patients may impair GC-T FH cell differentiation and thus abrogate the generation of germinal centers. Although, in principle, phenotypically defined CD4 + Bcl-6 + T cells could include both T FH cells and T follicular regulatory cells, we stained cells simultaneously with CD4, CXCR5, FOXP3, and Bcl-6 among other markers and used multispectral imaging to establish that, although there were FOXP3 + T reg cells present, there was no overlap in Bcl-6 and FoxP3 expression in COVID-19 secondary lymphoid organs, indicating that there are very few if any T follicular regulatory cells in COVID-19 ( Figure S3 A). Although there is a developmental role for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in primary lymphoid follicular development ( Pasparakis et al., 1996 27. Pasparakis, M. ∙ Alexopoulou, L. ∙ Episkopou, V. ... Immune and inflammatory responses in TNF alpha-deficient mice: a critical requirement for TNF alpha in the formation of primary B cell follicles, follicular dendritic cell networks and germinal centers, and in the maturation of the humoral immune response J.

Distinct roles for lymphotoxin-alpha and tumor necrosis factor in organogenesis and spatial organization of lymphoid tissue Eur. J.

Ryg-Cornejo, V. ∙ Ioannidis, L.J. ∙ Ly, A. ... Severe malaria infections impair germinal center responses by inhibiting T follicular helper cell differentiation Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :68-81 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ; Popescu et al., 2019 30. Popescu, M. ∙ Cabrera-Martinez, B. ∙ Winslow, G.M. TNF-α contributes to lymphoid tissue disorganization and germinal center B cell suppression during intracellular bacterial infection J. Immunol. 2019; 203 :2415-2424 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), and also linked genetically to an abundance of TNF-α ( Popescu et al., 2019 30. Popescu, M. ∙ Cabrera-Martinez, B. ∙ Winslow, G.M. TNF-α contributes to lymphoid tissue disorganization and germinal center B cell suppression during intracellular bacterial infection J. Immunol. 2019; 203 :2415-2424 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore also examined activated secondary lymphoid tissues from controls and COVID-19 lymph nodes for TNF-α expression. In this case, we used tonsils from non-COVID-infected patients as a control for activated lymphoid tissue. Although TNF-α is expressed at low levels in the follicle in controls, in COVID-19, it is expressed very abundantly both inside and outside the follicle ( Figures S3 C and S3D). These data indicate that the differentiation of activated CD4 + T cells into GC-type Bcl-6 + T FH cells is specifically blocked in COVID-19. Given the information obtained from the above animal models ( Popescu et al., 2019 30. Popescu, M. ∙ Cabrera-Martinez, B. ∙ Winslow, G.M. TNF-α contributes to lymphoid tissue disorganization and germinal center B cell suppression during intracellular bacterial infection J. Immunol. 2019; 203 :2415-2424 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ryg-Cornejo et al., 2016 36. Ryg-Cornejo, V. ∙ Ioannidis, L.J. ∙ Ly, A. ... Severe malaria infections impair germinal center responses by inhibiting T follicular helper cell differentiation Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :68-81 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is possible that the aberrant and exuberant synthesis of TNF-α at the site of T FH differentiation in COVID-19 lymph nodes may contribute to the lack of germinal centers and the impaired quality and durability of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in this disease.
We hypothesized that the reduction in GC-T FH cell numbers likely reflects a block in differentiation and next sought to determine whether this reduction was specific to this particular CD4 + T cell subset. We quantitated CD4 + T cell subsets in the lymph nodes and spleens using the well-established transcription factors T-bet, GATA-3, RORγt, and FOXP3 as key markers. In contrast to the reduced GC-T FH cell numbers, T H1 cells were consistently increased early and late in both the lymph nodes and spleen, whereas an increase in T H17 cells was more variable ( Figure 4 ). In contrast, a consistent reduction in T H2 cells was observed ( Figure 4 ). Late in the disease, FOXP3 + T reg cells made up a large part of the population of CD4 + T cells. Overall, there was an increase in secondary lymphoid organ CD4 + T cells relative to CD8 + T cells in COVID-19 secondary lymphoid organs, though this was variable ( Figure S4 ). These data indicate that the defect in GC-type T FH cell differentiation is specific and suggest that this defect may be indirectly linked to the strong T H1 response seen in this disease.
The preservation in COVID-19 of AID + B cells and the relatively large proportions of CD4 + CXCR5 + T FH cells (that do not express Bcl-6) and T H1 cells, both known to express CD40L, led us to hypothesize that, even though there were no germinal centers, there may be frequent T-B conjugates in COVID-19 within follicles as well as in extra-follicular locations. The absence of germinal centers (most germinal center B cells are immunoglobulin D [IgD] − CD27 − Bcl-6 + AID + CXCR5 + CD19 + cells) offered the opportunity to directly ask whether many of the scattered activated AID + B cells inside and outside follicles in COVID-19 secondary lymphoid organs were also IgD − CD27 − “double-negative” B cells. These cells are often observed in chronic infectious contexts, including in viral infections as well as in autoimmunity ( Portugal et al., 2017 31. Portugal, S. ∙ Obeng-Adjei, N. ∙ Moir, S. ... Atypical memory B cells in human chronic infectious diseases: an interim report Cell. Immunol. 2017; 321 :18-25 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jenks et al., 2019 11. Jenks, S.A. ∙ Cashman, K.S. ∙ Woodruff, M.C. ... Extrafollicular responses in humans and SLE Immunol. Rev. 2019; 288 :136-148 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). They are considered to be “disease-related” cells and are generally described as “extra-follicular,” implying they are not derived from the germinal center reaction but are frequently class switched and have the hallmarks of having been induced in a T-dependent manner without germinal-center-based selection. At extra-follicular and follicular sites, these double-negative B cells may be less capable of inducing the differentiation of the Bcl-6 + GC-T FH cells that are required to induce germinal centers.
By applying computational tools to systematically quantitate the area of cytoplasmic overlap between sets of two cells of two different cell types, and using pre-determined cutoffs to assess true cell-cell interaction, we quantified the degree and intimacy of plasma membrane contacts between cells and observed the presence of numerous T-B conjugates in COVID-19 lymph nodes and spleens ( Figure S5 ). The presence of IgD − CD27 − double-negative cells both within and outside follicles in COVID-19 lymph nodes and spleens was clearly evident ( Figure S5 ). IgG-expressing class-switched plasmablasts were prominent within both the follicular and extra-follicular areas ( Figure S3 B). These data indicate that, in the absence of germinal center formation in COVID-19, an extra-follicular type of class-switched B cell response, more typical of disease rather than of long-lasting protection, predominates in secondary lymphoid organs.
Although the interrogation of secondary lymphoid organs from autopsies helps provide snapshots regarding the sites of the induction of the immune response, we sought to obtain information from patients at different stages of the disease, including convalescence and ongoing severe illness, by the use of extended flow cytometry panels by examining peripheral blood from patients. Given the observed accumulation of activated non-germinal-center-derived B cells, such as IgD − CD27 − double-negative B cells, in COVID-19 lymphoid organs, we examined whether similar activated B cell populations with binding specificity for SARS-CoV-2 could be found in the circulation in persons with disparate disease severity.
Patients were divided into gradations of severity that included asymptomatic convalescence and active severe illness requiring hospitalization that was further subdivided by intermediate (CRP < 200 mg/L; “CRP int”) and high (CRP > 200 mg/L; “CRP hi”) levels of maximum inflammatory marker elevation ( Table S4 ). Studies on freshly isolated PBMCs revealed that the proportions and absolute numbers of total CD19 + B cells in addition to naive (IgD + CD27 − ), early transitional T1 and T2 (IgD + CD27 − CD10 + CD45RB − ), and CXCR5 + follicular (IgD + CD27 − CD10 − CD73 + ; Farmer et al., 2019 6. Farmer, J.R. ∙ Allard-Chamard, H. ∙ Sun, N. ... Induction of metabolic quiescence defines the transitional to follicular B cell switch Sci. Signal. 2019; 12 :eaaw5573 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) B cell subsets were markedly reduced in severely ill COVID-19 patients with high CRP levels as compared to convalescent patients and healthy controls ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S6 , and S7 ). The relative loss of these naive B cells correlated with the maximum level of CRP elevation ( Figure 5 C) and with the clinical parameters of symptom duration at the time of blood draw and total days of hospital admission for loss of early transitional B cells, specifically ( Figure 5 D). These data suggest a direct association between these B cell phenotypic changes in blood and patient clinical morbidity from COVID-19. They indicate that, in the milieu of severe COVID-19, B cells either develop very inefficiently in the bone marrow or are possibly generated but acquire an activated phenotype and are lost. This results in a marked reduction in early transitional and follicular B cells and likely further compounds defects in humoral immunity.
Within the CD27 + memory B cell compartment, total switched memory (IgD − ) B cells, including activated (CD21 lo ) switched memory B cells, and plasmablasts were significantly elevated (as a proportion of all B cells) in severely ill COVID-19 patients with high CRP levels as compared to convalescent COVID-19 patients and healthy controls ( Figures 6 A and 6B), though in terms of absolute numbers, these relative increases were blunted by the greater degree of B cell lymphopenia ( Figure S7 ). Within the IgD + CD27 − compartment, severely ill patients with COVID-19 and high CRP levels, specifically, showed an increase in a number of disease-related presumed non-germinal-center-derived activated B cells as compared to convalescent patients. These include activated naive B cells (IgD + CD27 − CD21 lo CD11c hi ; Kaminski et al., 2012 13. Kaminski, D.A. ∙ Wei, C. ∙ Rosenberg, A.F. ... Multiparameter flow cytometry and bioanalytics for B cell profiling in systemic lupus erythematosus Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 900 :109-134 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as atypical late transitional B cells (IgD + CD27 − CD10 − CD73 − CXCR5 − ; Figure 6 C). Additionally, IgD − CD27 − CXCR5 − B cells that include populations described by Kaminski et al. based on the expression of CXCR5 and CD11c were expanded in severely ill COVID-19 patients with high CRP levels, specifically, as compared to convalescent patients and healthy controls ( Figure 6 D). The sum accumulation of these activated B cells was markedly higher in the severely ill COVID-19 patients with high versus intermediate CRP levels and also in comparison to convalescent patients and healthy controls ( Figure 6 E). Paralleling the trends observed with the loss of early transitional B cells, the gain in circulating activated B cells correlated with higher CRP levels and increased patient morbidity as measured by symptom duration and length of inpatient hospitalization ( Figure 6 F).
Although recent studies have also documented circulating activated B cell populations in COVID-19 patients ( Mathew et al., 2020 25. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ...

Critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients display lupus-like hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ), the antigen specificity of these cells was not evaluated. We tested whether the activated B cell populations we had identified were specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) using recombinant RBD labeled separately with allophycocyanin (APC) and phycoerythrin (PE) fluorophores. Cells that stained with both labeled probes were considered authentic RBD-specific B cells ( Figure 7 A). This probe contains a very small fraction of all the potential antibody epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 but is highly specific for this particular virus ( Premkumar et al., 2020 32.

All the activated and mainly disease-related populations of relevance in COVID-19 contain SARS-CoV-2-specific cells ( Figures 7 A and 7B), establishing that they were expanded as a result of an adaptive immune response to this virus. In particular, the presence of antigen-specific double-negative B cells, switched memory B cells, and plasmablasts is consistent with an extra-germinal center/extra-follicular type class-switched antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These data establish that the aberrant non-germinal-center-type-activated B cells that accumulate in tissues also accumulate in the blood of severely ill and convalescent COVID-19 patients, and these include virus-specific B cells. Given that they bear the hallmarks of not being from germinal centers, they are therefore unlikely to provide optimal or durable humoral immunity.

Section: Discussion

Long-lasting B cell memory and the highest affinity pathogen-specific antibodies are derived within germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs. Germinal centers are anatomically structured to facilitate the selection of high-affinity B cell with long lifespans ( Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012 40. Victora, G.D. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Germinal centers Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :429-457 Crossref Scopus (1490) PubMed Google Scholar ). Longevity of such responses exceeds decades for some infectious diseases and, when a substantial portion of a population is infected, can contribute to herd immunity. In contrast, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 appear to be similar to other human coronaviruses in being short lived in a large fraction of individuals ( Long et al., 2020 20. Long, Q.X. ∙ Liu, B.Z. ∙ Deng, H.J. ... Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :845-848 Crossref Scopus (2078) PubMed Google Scholar ). Understanding the reasons for this decline in responses requires architectural studies of lymphoid organs from patients coupled with cell-cell interaction analyses, as well as approaches to reliably identify, quantify, and physically locate the diverse immune cell types that contribute to antibody induction. Using quantitative multi-color immunofluorescence combined with multispectral imaging and cell-cell interaction analyses of autopsy specimens as well as analyses of peripheral blood samples in parallel cohorts with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, we show evidence for dysregulated humoral immune induction early in COVID-19, including a striking absence of germinal centers in the earliest stages of infection, defective Bcl6 + T FH cell generation, and aberrant lymphoid TNF-α production.
The absence of Bcl-6 + T follicular helper cells (and the consequent absence of germinal centers) in COVID-19 secondary lymphoid organs provides an explanation for a phenomenon anecdotally observed in autopsies of many different severe viral infections. These findings also provide a mechanistic basis for the recent descriptions of non-durable humoral immune responses, impaired humoral immunity, and the low levels of somatic hypermutation in antibodies from convalescent COVID-19 patients ( Long et al., 2020 20. Long, Q.X. ∙ Liu, B.Z. ∙ Deng, H.J. ... Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :845-848 Crossref Scopus (2078) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robbiani et al., 2020 34. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Brouwer et al., 2020 2. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ). The alteration of the cytokine milieu in secondary lymphoid organs in this disease likely reflects a continuum across the spectrum of disease. Although T-dependent B cell activation, class switching, and some low-level somatic hypermutation do occur in COVID-19, the germinal center reaction is sub-optimal or totally absent, and this will likely, in due course of time, be reflected in less-durable class-switched antibody responses similar to those seen in SARS and MERS. These findings have some bearing on concepts such as herd immunity and immunity passports following natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. They strongly underscore the need and relevance of vaccination approaches to the prevention of COVID-19.
Severe infections by many different human viruses result in high levels of circulating cytokines and peripheral lymphopenia, but few studies have examined secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses are generated. Autopsy studies have revealed lymphoid depletion of the spleen and lymph nodes in Ebola, Marburg, and in H5N1 ( Martines et al., 2015 24. Martines, R.B. ∙ Ng, D.L. ∙ Greer, P.W. ... Tissue and cellular tropism, pathology and pathogenesis of Ebola and Marburg viruses J. Pathol. 2015; 235 :153-174 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rippey et al., 1984 33. Rippey, J.J. ∙ Schepers, N.J. ∙ Gear, J.H. The pathology of Marburg virus disease S. Afr. Med. J. 1984; 66 :50-54 PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2008 21. Lu, M. ∙ Xie, Z.G. ∙ Gao, Z.C. ...

A systematic molecular pathology study of a laboratory confirmed H5N1 human case PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e13315 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). In SARS, lymphoid depletion and loss of germinal centers was also reported ( Gu et al., 2005 9. Gu, J. ∙ Gong, E. ∙ Zhang, B. ... Multiple organ infection and the pathogenesis of SARS J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202 :415-424 Crossref Scopus (1078) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autopsy studies in these severe viral infections had not systematically examined lymphoid populations in secondary lymphoid organs. More detailed mechanistic studies of tissues have been undertaken in murine model systems. In a mouse model of severe malaria, germinal center responses were defective, and this was linked to a defect in T follicular helper cell differentiation ( Ryg-Cornejo et al., 2016 36. Ryg-Cornejo, V. ∙ Ioannidis, L.J. ∙ Ly, A. ... Severe malaria infections impair germinal center responses by inhibiting T follicular helper cell differentiation Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :68-81 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ) that could be reversed by TNF-α blockade. Ehrlichia muris infection in mice has also been associated with the loss of germinal centers, and TNF-α blockade restored germinal centers as did the genetic deletion of TNF-α ( Popescu et al., 2019 30. Popescu, M. ∙ Cabrera-Martinez, B. ∙ Winslow, G.M. TNF-α contributes to lymphoid tissue disorganization and germinal center B cell suppression during intracellular bacterial infection J. Immunol. 2019; 203 :2415-2424 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). A mouse immunization model that involved prior generation of specific CD4 + T cell memory prior to infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus generated a severe cytokine storm, splenic shrinkage, loss of germinal centers, and bone marrow hypocellularity, suggesting that lymphopenia and lymphoid organ abnormalities may be attributed to immune mechanisms rather than being a direct consequence of viral cytolysis ( Penaloza-MacMaster et al., 2015 28. Penaloza-MacMaster, P. ∙ Barber, D.L. ∙ Wherry, E.J. ... Vaccine-elicited CD4 T cells induce immunopathology after chronic LCMV infection Science. 2015; 347 :278-282 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies in mice, taken together, suggest that significant elevation of secreted cytokines and chemokines seen in the context of protozoan, bacterial, and viral infections can cause the loss of germinal centers.
The studies of Ryg-Cornejo et al. in murine malaria and our studies in COVID-19 suggest that the observed cytokine and chemokine dysregulation may block germinal center type T follicular helper cell differentiation. The contribution of TNF-α to follicular development and germinal center formation ( Pasparakis et al., 1996 27. Pasparakis, M. ∙ Alexopoulou, L. ∙ Episkopou, V. ...

Distinct roles for lymphotoxin-alpha and tumor necrosis factor in organogenesis and spatial organization of lymphoid tissue Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27 :2600-2609 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as to the loss of germinal centers is complex and seemingly contradictory ( Ryg-Cornejo et al., 2016 36. Ryg-Cornejo, V. ∙ Ioannidis, L.J. ∙ Ly, A. ... Severe malaria infections impair germinal center responses by inhibiting T follicular helper cell differentiation Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :68-81 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ; Popescu et al., 2019 30. Popescu, M. ∙ Cabrera-Martinez, B. ∙ Winslow, G.M. TNF-α contributes to lymphoid tissue disorganization and germinal center B cell suppression during intracellular bacterial infection J. Immunol. 2019; 203 :2415-2424 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local cytokine concentrations at the site of T follicular helper cell differentiation likely have important consequences for the germinal center reaction. The differentiation of CD4 + Bcl-6 − CXCR5 + pre-germinal center T FH cells into CD4 + Bcl-6 + CXCR5 + GC-T FH cells likely occurs extra-follicularly at the T-B interface ( Kerfoot et al., 2011 14.

Vinuesa, C.G. ∙ Linterman, M.A. ∙ Yu, D. ... Follicular helper T cells Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34 :335-368 Crossref Scopus (799) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our findings, we suspect that the very high local levels of TNF-α and possibly other cytokines at this location in COVID-19 lymph nodes, possibly induced downstream of T H1 cell activation, block the final step in T follicular helper cell differentiation. In the murine malaria model, IFN-γ blockade also restored T FH cells and germinal centers, consistent with T H1 cells being upstream of the induction of TNF-α. Given that Bcl-6 + B cells, Bcl-6 + T FH cells, and Bcl-6 + T follicular regulatory cells are all extremely sparse or absent in COVID-19 secondary lymphoid organs, the formal possibility that excessive TNF signaling (or excessive signaling by some combination of cytokines in the extra-follicular area) negatively impacts the expression of BCL6 either transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally also needs to be investigated. Such deeper mechanistic studies can best be pursued in murine models.
Because of our focus on the loss of germinal centers, we have concentrated on TNF-α because of its known ability, when produced in excess, to contribute to impaired T FH cell differentiation and germinal center loss. Many other cytokines are induced in COVID-19 and probably contribute to some aspects of the phenotypes that we describe here. IL-6, for example, though it has pleiotropic effects, is known to suppress lymphopoiesis and induce myelopoiesis ( Maeda et al., 2009 22. Maeda, K. ∙ Malykhin, A. ∙ Teague-Weber, B.N. ... Interleukin-6 aborts lymphopoiesis and elevates production of myeloid cells in systemic lupus erythematosus-prone B6.Sle1.Yaa animals Blood. 2009; 113 :4534-4540 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it might thus contribute to the B lymphopenia that we document here.
Altered extra-follicular B cell activation could potentially also contribute to a defect in T follicular helper cell differentiation observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. After the initial activation of naive CD4 + T cells by dendritic cells presenting the relevant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule and peptide, along with co-stimulation, these T cells activate antigen-specific B cells that present the same MHC-peptide complex, and extra-follicular B cell foci are generated. It is in this vicinity that pre-germinal center T follicular helper cells are first generated, and we have shown in humans ( Maehara et al., 2018 23. Maehara, T. ∙ Mattoo, H. ∙ Mahajan, V.S. ... The expansion in lymphoid organs of IL-4 + BATF + T follicular helper cells is linked to IgG4 class switching in vivo Life Sci. Alliance. 2018; 1 :e201800050 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), as others have in mice ( Roco et al., 2019 35. Roco, J.A. ∙ Mesin, L. ∙ Binder, S.C. ... Class-switch recombination occurs infrequently in germinal centers Immunity. 2019; 51 :337-350.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ), that most isotype switching actually occurs at this location. In COVID-19, it is likely that some antibody generation occurs extra-follicularly, though we have identified IgG-expressing plasmablasts extra-follicularly as well as in the follicles bereft of germinal centers. Activated B cells expressing ICOSL provide additional differentiation signals to activated CD4 + T cells to acquire high levels of CXCR5, induce the expression of Bcl-6, and migrate into the follicles as fully differentiated germinal center type T follicular helper cells, which set up the germinal center reaction. Perhaps because cytokine alterations lead to the formation of dysfunctional B cells and plasmablasts outside the follicle, activated B cells in COVID-19 may be less capable of inducing cognate T cells to differentiate into germinal center type T follicular helper cells.
It is possible that our investigations may throw some light on the mechanisms of disease progression in severe COVID-19, although a deeper understanding will likely await the acquisition of more knowledge and the development of suitable animal models. The evasion of the anti-viral aspects of innate immunity and the overly aggressive activation of inflammation by the virus likely results in an altered milieu that contributes both to the relative attenuation of CD8 + T cell immunity and prevents the generation of Bcl-6 + T follicular helper cells. As a result of the latter, the early development of high-affinity antibodies that could contribute to some attenuation of viral spread may be compromised. Whether the increased CD4 + /CD8 + T cell ratio we observe in lymph nodes and spleens of COVID-19 patients reflects selective activation of CD4 + T cells or a preferential depletion of CD8 + T cells is unclear. Why certain individuals are more prone to initial more aggressive and destructive immune responses also remains a very difficult question to address at this time. Based on our analyses, severe disease does not appear to be due to a paucity of regulatory T cells in secondary lymphoid organs at the earlier stages of the disease, though our approaches do not interrogate T reg cell function. The striking relative accumulation of FOXP3 + regulatory T cells that we observe late in disease could possibly reflect a homeostatic mechanism for the resolution of infection. More likely, it reflects the reduced overall numbers of recirculating T cells entering lymphoid organs and the recurring activation of naive CD4 + T cells into activated subsets that egress these lymphoid organs while lymphoid organ-resident regulatory T cells perhaps do not leave these sites and therefore appear to accumulate in lymph nodes and the spleen.
In summary, even in acutely ill COVID-19 patients, at a time when they have extremely high viral loads and abundant virus has been demonstrated in their lungs, there is a striking absence of germinal centers associated with a marked reduction of germinal center B cells but preservation of AID-expressing B cells. Thus, though there is robust T-cell-mediated activation of B cells, germinal centers do not form. The robust activation of non-germinal center type B cell responses does not give rise to long-lived memory or high-affinity B cells. The underlying basis for the loss of germinal centers is best explained by the striking failure of differentiation of Bcl-6 + T follicular helper cells, likely because of dramatic changes in the extra-follicular cytokine milieu driven by T H1 cells and the aberrant local production of TNF-α in lymphoid organs. We believe these findings will be relevant to a range of human viral and non-viral diseases in which there is a cytokine storm, a better understanding of which will require a granular function-focused analysis of the architecture and composition of lymph nodes and spleens. We predict that a broadly applicable common mechanistic basis similar to what we describe here will be elucidated in future studies on MERS, H1N1, Ebola, Marburg, and other viral diseases.
Our studies on secondary lymphoid organs focused by necessity on very ill patients, and although changes in the disease may represent a continuum, it is quite possible that patients with less-severe disease may induce better germinal center responses. Of necessity, the numbers for thoracic lymph node and spleen were relatively small. We used a single approach to study lymphocyte populations in the lymph nodes and the spleen, and the complementary use of an orthogonal approach would have been ideal.

The published article includes all data generated or analyzed during this study, and summarized in the accompanying tables, figures and Supplemental Information .
Thoracic lymph nodes and spleens samples from COVID-19 patients were obtained through the Brigham and Women’s hospital Department of Pathology.
Sample Size Estimation: Power calculations and sample size estimation were not performed before the initiation of this study which was based primarily on the availability of COVID-19 positive autopsies for analysis between March and May 2020. All cases were retrieved from the Anatomic Pathology files of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and included 17 patients (information on age and gender in Tables S1 and S2 ) including 11 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who underwent autopsy in 2020.
Sample allocation to experimental groups: All patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs in a laboratory during hospital admission. All cases were divided into two groups; early (less than ten days from respiratory symptoms onsets to death, hospitalization of up to 8 days), and late (hospitalized for 15-36 days prior to death). Thoracic lymph nodes were obtained from six age-matched non-COVID-19 patients who underwent autopsies at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in the same time window. In addition, seven spleens from automobile accident victims were obtained from the Ragon Institute Tissue Core. These were histologically normal. Information on age and gender is in Table S3 . Ten discarded control tonsils from Massachusetts General Hospital not matched for age and gender were also used for initial titration and validation of certain antibodies and as controls for TNF-α and CD8 staining studies,
Peripheral blood samples were drawn from both Outpatients and Inpatients with COVID-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital and fresh blood was analyzed for flow cytometry using a multi-color panel.
Sample Size estimation: Power calculations were not undertaken pior to the initiation of these studies. However, the primary end-point was the sum of activated B cells (as a % CD19+ B cells in peripheral blood). Using a two sided Student’s t test to compare log values of convalescent and severe (CRP hi) COVID-19 patient samples, with groups of 10, we had more than 90% power to detect an effect of size of 1.20 between groups based on simulation studies using 10,000 Monte Carlo samples with a type 1 error rate of 5%.
Allocation to Experimental Groups: Data is presented on B cell populations from 68 patients, including moderately ill, severely ill and convalescent patients. Convalescence was defined as a clinically asymptomatic state on the date of blood draw, either from a baseline asymptomatic state or recuperated from moderate clinical symptoms of COVID- 19. Moderate disease was defined as active clinical symptoms of COVID-19 on the date of blood draw that did not necessitate a hospital admission. Severe disease was defined as active clinical symptoms of COVID-19 on the date of blood draw that did necessitate a hospital admission. Severe disease was further subdivided by maximum CRP level during hospital admission as CRP < 200 mg/L classified as ‘CRP intermediate (int)’ and CRP > 200 mg/L as ‘CRP high (hi).’
This study was performed with the approval of the Institutional Review Boards at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Tissue samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. These specimens were incubated with the following antibodies: anti-CD3 (clone: A045229-2; DAKO), anti-CD4 (clone: EPR6855;Abcam), anti-CD19 (clone: SKU310; Biocare Medical), anti-Bcl6 (clone: LN22; Biocare Medical), anti-AID (clone: ZA001; Invitrogen), anti-T-bet (clone: ab150440; Abcam), GATA3 (clone: CM405A; Biocare), ICOS (clone: 89601; Cell Signaling Technology), Rorc (clone: ab212496; Abcam), CXCR5 (clone: MAB190; R&D Systems), Foxp3 (clone: 98377; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CD8 (clone: ab85792; Abcam), anti-IgD (clone: AA093; DAKO), anti-CD27 (clone: ab131254; Abcam), anti-IgG (clone: ab109489; Abcam), anti-TNF-α (clone: ab6671; Abcam), and anti-CD35 (clone: ab25; Abcam) followed by incubation with a secondary antibody using an Opal Multiplex Kit (Perkin Elmer). The samples were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade mountant containing DAPI (Invitrogen).
Images of the tissue specimens were acquired using the TissueFAXS platform (TissueGnostics). For quantitative analysis, the entire area of the tissue was acquired as a digital grayscale image in five channels with filter settings for FITC, Cy3, Cy5 and AF75 in addition to DAPI. Cells of a given phenotype were identified and quantitated using the TissueQuest software (TissueGnostics), with cut-off values determined relative to the positive controls. This microscopy-based multicolor tissue cytometry software permits multicolor analysis of single cells within tissue sections similar to flow cytometry. In addition, multispectral images (seven-colors staining) were unmixed using spectral libraries built from images of single stained tissues for each reagent using the StrataQuest (TissueGnostics) software. StrataQuest software was also used to quantify cell-to-cell contact. In the StrataQuest cell-to-cell contact application, masks of the nuclei based on DAPI staining establish the inner boundary of the cytoplasm and the software “looks” outward toward the plasma membrane boundary. Overlap of at least 3 pixels of adjacent cell markers is required to establish a “contact” criterion. Although the software has been developed and validated more recently, the principle of the method and the algorithms used have been described in detail elsewhere ( Ecker and Steiner, 2004 5. Ecker, R.C. ∙ Steiner, G.E. Microscopy-based multicolor tissue cytometry at the single-cell level Cytometry A. 2004; 59 :182-190 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
1 Million fresh PBMCs were stained within 2 hours of isolation. Prior to antibody staining, Fc receptors were blocked using human FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi) at a concentration of 1:50 at 4°C for 10 minutes. Cells were surface stained at 4°C, protected from light, using optimized concentrations of fluorochrome-conjugated primary antibodies for 30 minutes as well as live/dead fixable blue stain (Thermo Fisher) at a concentration of 1:20 using the following antibody panels (clone, manufacturer).
B cell panel: CD3 (UCHT1, BD Biosciences), CD56 (NCAM16.2, BD Biosciences), CD19 (SJ25C1, BioLegend), CD27 (L128, BD Biosciences), IgD (IA6-2, BD Biosciences), CD38 (HB-7, BioLegend), CD10 (HI10a, BioLegend), CD21 (B-ly4, BD Biosciences), CD73 (AD2, BioLegend), CD45RB (MEM-55, BioLegend), CD138 (MI15, BioLegend), CD11c (Bu15, BioLegend), and CXCR5 (J252D4, BioLegend).
For the RBD-specific characterization, 6-7 million fresh PBMCs were stained using fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 RBD in addition to the B cell panel antibodies listed above.
Cells were then washed in PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at at 4°C. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Symphony (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and rainbow tracking beads (8 peaks calibration beads, Fisher) were used to ensure consistent signals between flow cytometry batches. FCS files were analyzed, and B cell subsets were quantified using FlowJo software (version 10).
SARS-2 RBD (GenBank: MN975262.1) was cloned into pVRC vector containing an HRV 3C-cleavable C-terminal SBP-His 8X tag and sequence confirmed by Genwiz. The construct was transiently transfected into mammalian Expi293F suspension cells for recombinant expression. 5 days post-transfection, supernatants were harvested and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. The RBD was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Cobalt-TALON resin (Takara) followed by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in PBS. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The fluorescent PE-SA (Invitrogen, Cat#12-4317-877) and APC-SA (Invitrogen; Cat#S32362) labels were added to the purified SBP-tagged RBD proteins through iterative complex formation, as previously described ( Weaver et al., 2016 42.

Protoc. 2016; 11 :193-213 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fluorescent SA conjugates were added to SBP-RBD in five increments to sequentially form the complexes. In this case the final molar ratio of probe to streptavidin valency was 1:1 (one SA-fluorophore can bind two SBP tags). After each stepwise addition of the fluorescent label, the mixture was incubated for 20 minutes and set rotating at 4C within an opaque 1.5 mL Eppendorf spin tube. Using this method, we generated fluorescent probes at a final concentration of 0.1ug/ul. An example of SBP-RBD (31,000 g/mol) labeled with PE-SA (300,000 g/mol) is described for a total 10 assays (0.5 ug labeled protein per assay): First, 5uL of SBP-RBD at 1ug/ul was diluted in 20.8uL PBS. Fluorescent PE-SA at 1ug/ul was then added in five increments, with an incremental volume of 4.8 uL for a final volume of 50uL.
Flow cytometry, clinical correlations and tissue studies. GraphPad Prism version 8 was used for statistical analysis, curve fitting and linear regression. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used to calculate p values for continuous, non-parametric variables. For comparing more than one population, Kruskal-Wallis testing was used with Dunn’s multiple comparison testing. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
