Title: N-terminal domain antigenic mapping reveals a site of vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2


Abstract: Summary

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein contains an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeted by most neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in COVID-19 patient plasma. Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD and their contribution to protection. Here, we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite (designated site i) recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, albeit selecting escape mutants in some animals. Indeed, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages, harbor frequent mutations within the NTD supersite, suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs for protective immunity and vaccine design.

Section: Introduction

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019 resulted in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, bringing the world to a standstill ( Zhou et al., 2020 106. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.L. ∙ Wang, X.G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (6424) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2020 107.

The lack of pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 combined with its efficient human-to-human transmission has already resulted in more than 109 million infections and over 2.3 million fatalities as of February 2021. Although vaccines are being developed and deployed at an unprecedented pace, the timeline for large-scale manufacturing and distribution to a large enough population for achieving community protection remains uncertain. As a result, prophylactic and/or therapeutic anti-viral drugs are expected to play a role in controlling COVID-19 disease and the ongoing pandemic. Such drugs may be helpful for unvaccinated individuals or those who respond poorly to vaccination, as well as upon waning of immunity and emergence of antigenically distinct variants or strains.
SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through attachment of the viral transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) followed by fusion of the viral and host membranes ( Letko et al., 2020 53.

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein comprises an N-terminal S 1 subunit responsible for virus-receptor binding and a C-terminal S 2 subunit that promotes virus-cell membrane fusion ( Walls et al., 2020b 87.

The S 1 subunit comprises an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), also known as domain A and B, respectively ( Tortorici and Veesler, 2019 82. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Veesler, D.

A subset of these mAbs is currently being evaluated in clinical trials or have recently received emergency use authorization from the FDA.

Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

Watanabe, Y. ∙ Allen, J.D. ∙ Wrapp, D. ... Site-specific glycan analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike Science. 2020; 369 :330-333 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, recent studies have reported the isolation of NTD-targeted mAbs and their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro , suggesting they could be useful for COVID-19 prophylaxis or treatment ( Chi et al., 2020 19. Chi, X. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, J. ...

Liu, L. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Nair, M.S. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies against multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike Nature. 2020; 584 :450-456 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the NTD has been proposed to interact with auxiliary receptors in cell types that do not express ACE2 (e.g., DC-SIGN/L-SIGN), its role and the mechanism of action of NTD-targeted neutralizing mAbs remain unknown ( Soh et al., 2020 74. Soh, W.T. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Nakayama, E.E. ... The N-terminal domain of spike glycoprotein mediates SARS-CoV-2 infection by associating with L-SIGN and DC-SIGN bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Understanding the immunogenicity of different S domains and the function of mAbs targeting them, including the NTD, is critical to a full understanding of immunity during the pandemic.
Here, we analyze Ab responses in three COVID-19 convalescent individuals and describe 41 NTD-specific human mAbs. Integrating cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), binding assays, and Ab escape mutant analysis, we define a SARS-CoV-2 NTD antigenic map and identify a supersite (designated site i) recognized by potent neutralizing mAbs. We show that these mAbs exhibit neutralization activities on par with best-in-class RBD-specific mAbs and efficiently activate Fc-mediated effector functions. We also identify immunologically important variation of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD suggesting that the S glycoprotein is under selective pressure from the host humoral immune response. Finally, we provide proof-of-principle that prophylactic administration of a highly potent NTD mAb confers protection of Syrian hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge albeit selecting for escape mutants in some animals. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs for protective immunity, virus evolution, and vaccine design.

Section: Results

To discover mAbs targeting diverse SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, we sorted immunoglobulin (Ig)G + memory B cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of three COVID-19 convalescent individuals (L, M, X) using biotinylated prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S as a bait. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG + memory B cells ranged between 1.1%–1.3%. A total of 278 mAbs were isolated and recombinantly produced as human IgG1 ( Figure 1 A). Characterization by ELISA showed that most mAbs isolated from the three donors recognize the RBD (65%–77%), with a smaller fraction targeting the NTD (6%–20%). The remaining mAbs (4%–20%) are expected to bind to either the S 2 subunit or the C-D domains within the S 1 subunit ( Figure 1 A). The low proportion of NTD-specific mAbs isolated from these donors is in line with the previously observed limited NTD immunogenicity in SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals ( Piccoli et al., 2020 64. Piccoli, L. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

Isolation of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and protection from disease in a small animal model Science. 2020; 369 :956-963 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, we identified 41 mAbs recognizing the SARS-CoV2 NTD with EC 50 s ranging between 7.6–698 ng/mL and nanomolar binding affinities, as evaluated using ELISA and biolayer interferometry, respectively ( Figures 1 B and S1 A; Table S1 ). These NTD-specific mAbs use a large repertoire of V genes, with an over-representation of IGHV3-21 and IGK3-15 genes ( Figures S1 B and S1C; Table S1 ), and harbor few somatic hypermutations (VH and VL are 97.57% and 97.54% identical to V germline genes, respectively; Figure S1 D; Table S1 ), as previously described for many SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs binding to the RBD ( Piccoli et al., 2020 64.

Seydoux, E. ∙ Homad, L.J. ∙ MacCamy, A.J. ... Characterization of neutralizing antibodies from a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). CDRH3 lengths range between 10 and 24 amino acid residues ( Figure S1 E). Collectively, these data indicate that the Ab response to the SARS-CoV-2 NTD is polyclonal.
The in vitro neutralization activity of the NTD-specific mAbs was subsequently evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV) system ( Millet and Whittaker, 2016 62. Millet, J.K. ∙ Whittaker, G.R. Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV)-based Coronavirus Spike-pseudotyped Particle Production and Infection Biol.

Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Out of 41 mAbs, 9 are potent neutralizers (IC 50 < 50 ng/mL) and 6 are moderate neutralizers (IC 50 of 50–150 ng/mL) ( Figure 1 C). The remaining 25 mAbs were non-neutralizing. Most of the mAbs plateaued around 80%–90% maximum neutralization in this assay ( Figure 1 D). Evaluation of the neutralization potency of a subset of NTD-specific mAbs measured 6 h post-infection of Vero E6 cells infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus confirmed that these mAbs did not completely block viral entry and instead plateaued at 80%–90% neutralization, as opposed to the RBD-specific mAbs S309, S2E12, and S2M11 that achieved 100% neutralization ( Figure 1 E) ( Pinto et al., 2020 65. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tortorici et al., 2020 83. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Beltramello, M. ∙ Lempp, F.A. ... Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms Science. 2020; 370 :950-957 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). When the activity was measured at 24 h post-infection, however, all mAbs tested achieved 95%–100% neutralization with a marked enhancement of neutralization potency ( Figure 1 F). For instance, S2X333 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with an IC 50 of 2 ng/mL and an IC 90 of 12 ng/mL, on par with the best-in-class ultrapotent RBD-targeting mAbs S2E12 and S2M11 ( Figure 1 F). The time-dependent difference of the results may reflect inhibition of extensive viral spread during the 24 h assay as opposed to the sole inhibition of viral entry measured after 6 h.
Previous studies established that SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells proceeds through cathepsin-activated endosomal fusion, as opposed to TMPRSS2-dependent entry, which is supposed to occur at the level of the plasma membrane and to be the most relevant route of lung cells infection ( Hoffmann et al., 2020a 41. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Pöhlmann, S. A Multibasic Cleavage Site in the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Is Essential for Infection of Human Lung Cells Mol.

Chloroquine does not inhibit infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2020; 585 :588-590 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, and S2X333 efficiently blocked cell-cell membrane fusion of Vero E6 cells transiently transfected with full-length wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S ( Figure S1 F), binding of S2L28, S2M28, and S2X333 to SARS-CoV-2 S was dampened by 2 orders of magnitude at endosomal pH (pH5) compared to neutral pH (pH7) ( Figure S1 G). As cell-cell membrane fusion bypasses the endosomal compartment, S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, and S2X333 efficiently blocked fusion of Vero E6 cells transiently transfected with full-length wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S ( Figure S1 F). Therefore, partial neutralization may have been a result of reduced blocking of the endosomal entry route at 6 h post-infection, whereas cell-cell spread of the virus after 24 h was efficiently blocked.
To elucidate the mechanism of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by NTD mAbs, we carried out single-particle cryo-EM analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer bound to one NTD-specific mAb from each donor—S2L28, S2M28 or S2X333—in combination with the RBD-specific mAb S2M11. S2M11 was used as it locks the RBDs in the closed state by recognizing a quaternary epitope spanning two adjacent RBDs, thus enabling the use of 3-fold symmetry during reconstruction ( Tortorici et al., 2020 83. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Beltramello, M. ∙ Lempp, F.A. ... Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms Science. 2020; 370 :950-957 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). 3D classification of the particle images belonging to each dataset revealed the presence of homogeneous ternary complexes with three S2M11 Fabs bound to the RBDs and three bound NTD Fabs radiating from the trimer periphery. We determined reconstructions at 2.6 Å, 2.5 Å, and 2.2 Å for the S2L28/S2M11/S, S2M28/S2M11/S, and S2X333/S2M11/S complexes ( Figures 2 A–2I and S2 A–S2C; Table S2 ). We subsequently used local refinement to account for the pronounced conformational dynamics of S2L28, S2M28, and S2X333 and obtained reconstructions at 2.6–3.0 Å resolution for the region comprising the Fab variable domains and their bound epitope in the NTD ( Figures 2 A–2I and S2 A–S2C; Table S2 ). In parallel, we determined a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD in complex with the S2M28 Fab at 3.0 Å resolution revealing several additional ordered loops and N-linked glycans ( Figures 2 E–2H; Table S3 ).
S2L28, S2M28, and S2X333 contact the N-terminal region (residues 14–20, NTD N terminus), a β-hairpin formed by residues 140–158 (supersite β-hairpin), and a loop spanning residues 245–264 (supersite loop). These three regions collectively form an antigenic supersite on the pinnacle of the NTD on the side distal to the viral membrane ( Figures 2 A–2I). The epitopes targeted by S2L28, S2M28, and S2X333 are overlapping and flanked by the oligosaccharides at position N17 and N149, which are located at opposite sides of the antigenic supersite ( Figures 2 D–2I). As a stunning example of convergent binding, each mAb uses hydrophobic residues at the tip of the HCDR3 loop to contact the NTD supersite near residue R246. For S2L28, S2M28, and S2X333, this hydrophobic residue is W105, I93, and W106, respectively ( Figures 2 G–2I).
Although these Fabs recognize overlapping epitopes within this antigenic supersite, the detailed nature of the interactions formed with the NTD varies. In particular, S2L28 primarily binds to residues in the NTD supersite loop including residue D253 ( Figure 2 G), while S2X333 interacts primarily with the N-terminal region including residue N17 and the supersite β-hairpin including residues E156 and R158 ( Figure 2 I). S2M28 interacts extensively with all three supersite regions, including residues 146–148 in the supersite β-hairpin, D253 in the supersite loop, and N17 in the N-terminal region ( Figure 2 H). As a result of these distinct interactions, whereas the S2L28-bound NTD adopts an identical conformation to that observed in the apo S structures ( Walls et al., 2020b 87.

Cryo-EM maps of S2L28-, S2M28-, S2X28-, and S2X333-bound SARS-CoV-2 S delineate an antigenic supersite recognized by potent NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs isolated from COVID-19 individuals ( Figures 2 A–2I and S3 A). Likewise, the previously described mAb 4A8 ( Chi et al., 2020 19. Chi, X. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, J. ... A neutralizing human antibody binds to the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :650-655 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as the recently described FC05 ( Zhang et al., 2020 104. Zhang, L. ∙ Cao, L. ∙ Gao, X.-S. ... A proof of concept for neutralizing antibody-guided vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) and CM25 ( Voss et al., 2020 84. Voss, W.N. ∙ Hou, Y.J. ∙ Johnson, N.V. ... Prevalent, protective, and convergent IgG recognition of SARS-CoV-2 non-RBD spike epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent plasma bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), bind to the same NTD antigenic supersite to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, these results show that NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs have adopted a convergent mechanism of viral inhibition through the use of multiple V genes ( Table S1 ), which points to a key role of the NTD supersite in viral neutralization and putatively also infection.
To understand the markedly different neutralization potencies across the 41 NTD-specific mAbs identified, we carried out competition biolayer interferometry binding assays using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer or isolated NTD. The data indicated that the mAbs recognize six distinct antigenic sites, which we designated i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi. Most mAbs clustered within antigenic sites i and iii whereas sites ii, iv, v, and vi each accounted for only one or a small number of mAbs from our panel ( Figure 3 A). All potently neutralizing mAbs competed for binding to the NTD site i, indicating they recognize overlapping epitopes within the structurally identified antigenic supersite ( Figures 1 B–1E, 2 , and 3 A).
To evaluate the presence of site i-specific mAbs in previously infected or vaccinated individuals, we carried out competition ELISA using S2X28. Plasma from infected individuals and convalescent subjects that received a first dose of mRNA vaccine (convalescent-Vx1), but not naive-vaccinated individuals (Vx1), efficiently competed with S2X28 for binding to the antigenic supersite (site i) ( Table S5 ). These results confirm that in some individuals, antigenic site i-specific Abs can be elicited as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection and are possibly boosted upon vaccination despite the dense glycosylation of the NTD.
To delineate the different NTD antigenic sites, we mapped the epitopes targeted by representative mAbs through determination of cryo-EM structures of S2M24, S2X316, or S2L20 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 S, together with S2M11 to expedite structural determination at 6–8 Å resolution ( Figure S3 ; Table S4 ). S2L20 (site iv) binds to an epitope flanked by glycans at positions N17, N61, and N234 located within the NTD side, which faces the RBD belonging to the same protomer ( Figures 3 B–3D). S2M24 (site vi) recognizes the viral membrane proximal side of the NTD, which is devoid of glycans except for the presence of the N61 oligosaccharide on the edge of the epitope ( Figures 3 B–3D). S2M24 recognizes a similar antigenic site as the one described for the polyclonal Fabs COV57 isolated directly from COVID-19 patient sera ( Barnes et al., 2020b 7. Barnes, C.O. ∙ West, A.P. ∙ Huey-Tubman, K.E. ... Structures of Human Antibodies Bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Reveal Common Epitopes and Recurrent Features of Antibodies Cell. 2020; 182 :828-842.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). S2X316 (site v) interacts with an epitope residing nearby glycans N74 and N149 at the peripheral-most part of the NTD, located in between antigenic sites i and vi ( Figures 3 B–3D). As all NTD-specific mAbs with neutralizing activity target the structurally identified antigenic supersite site (site i), our data points to the existence of a site of vulnerability that is harnessed by the immune system of multiple individuals.
Analysis of the 508,771 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences deposited in GISAID as of February 12, 2021 reveals a larger number of prevalent mutations and deletions in the NTD relative to other regions of the S glycoprotein ( Figure 4 A). We therefore set out to evaluate the impact on NTD-specific mAb binding of several mutations identified within and outside the NTD antigenic supersite along with a few mutants designed based on the structural data. The recombinant mutant NTDs tested include S12F, L18F, T19A (removes the N15 glycan), a 69/70 deletion, D80A, a Y144 deletion, H146Y, N149Q (removes the N149 glycan), A222V, R246A, D253G/Y, S254F, S255F, and the B1.351 NTD (comprising the L18F, D80A, D215G, 242–244 deletion, and R246I mutations).
All neutralizing NTD mAbs bound efficiently to NTD variants carrying either a 69/70 deletion or the A222V substitutions, indicating the site i-targeting mAbs would not be affected by these common SARS-CoV-2 mutations ( Hodcroft et al., 2020 40. Hodcroft, E.B. ∙ Zuber, M. ∙ Nadeau, S. ... Emergence and spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant through Europe in the summer of 2020 medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 A and 4B). The R246A substitution decreased binding of S2L28, S2M28, and S2X333 (to various extents), in agreement with the extensive interactions formed by the R246 side chain with aromatic and hydrophobic residues found in the HCDR3 of each mAb. This substitution also markedly affected the binding of S2X28 and of the previously described mAb 4A8 ( Chi et al., 2020 19. Chi, X. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, J. ... A neutralizing human antibody binds to the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :650-655 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 B). The L18F, D80A, D253G/Y, or S255F variants only abrogated binding of S2L28 to the NTD, which is relevant considering the L18F substitution is one of the most prevalent mutants sequenced to date and is present in both the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages ( Tegally et al., 2020 78. Tegally, H. ∙ Wilkinson, E. ∙ Giovanetti, M. ... Emergence and rapid spread of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage with multiple spike mutations in South Africa medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 B). Conversely, the Y144 deletion abrogated binding to S2M28, S2X28, S2X333, and 4A8, but not S2L28, explaining the lost ability of these mAbs to neutralize the B.1.1.7 S pseudovirus, which contains this deletion ( Collier et al., 2021 23. Collier, D.A. ∙ De Marco, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 to mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ; Davies et al., 2020 29. Davies, N.G. ∙ Barnard, R.C. ∙ Jarvis, C.I. ... Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 B). The H146Y mutant reduced binding of S2M28, S2X28, and in particular of 4A8 ( Figure 4 A). Binding of all site i-specific NTD mAbs to the B.1.351 NTD was abrogated, in agreement with a recent study showing that 4A8 did not recognize this NTD variant ( Wibmer et al., 2021 95. Wibmer, C.K. ∙ Ayres, F. ∙ Hermanus, T. ... SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 escapes neutralization by South African COVID-19 donor plasma bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, binding of the non-neutralizing S2L20 NTD-specific mAb was not affected by any of these variants, confirming retention of proper folding of the purified NTD mutants ( Figure 4 A). Collectively these data show that S2M28, S2X28, S2X333, and 4A8 have a similar reactivity profile to these NTD mutants, whereas S2L28 has a distinct and complementary pattern. These data demonstrate that several currently circulating variants will partially or completely escape neutralization mediated by mAbs targeting the antigenic supersite (site i), including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages.
To investigate the cross-reactivity of NTD-specific mAbs with sarbecovirus S glycoproteins, we probed individual mAb binding to ExpiCHO cells expressing full-length S from representative members of the three clades of the sarbecovirus subgenus. All mAbs tested bound to RaTG13 S, which is the most closely related S glycoprotein and NTD to SARS-CoV-2 S ( Figure 4 C). S2X333 and S2M28 weakly bound to S from the Pangolin Guanxi 2017 (P-GX) isolate, whereas S2L28 and S2M28 weakly bound to S from the Pangolin Guangdong 2019 (P-GD) isolate ( Figure 4 C). Consistently, weak mAb binding to P-GD S was confirmed by ELISA for S2L28, S2M28, S2X333, and S2M24 ( Figure S4 A). We next evaluated the neutralization breadth of S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, and S2X333 against SARS-CoV-2- and SARS-CoV-related sarbecoviruses using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped neutralization assay. All mAbs tested neutralized RaTG13 S pseudotypes with comparable potency to SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus but none of them neutralized the more distantly related P-GX S, P-GD S, SARS-CoV S, WIV1 S, or WIV16 S pseudotyped viruses ( Figures S4 B–S4H). These findings are in line with the low conservation of the NTD supersite (site i) in phylogenetically distant viruses and indicate that NTD mAbs could be useful countermeasures against a subset of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 but not against divergent viruses. Both species-specific functions and host immunity may play a role in the antigenic diversification of this region compared to other S domains that are more conserved.
To investigate potential viral escape from neutralization mediated by the potent neutralizing NTD mAbs, we passaged a replication competent VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimera in which the native glycoprotein was replaced by the SARS-CoV-2 S Wuhan-1 isolate gene in the presence of S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, and S2X333, as previously described ( Case et al., 2020 16. Case, J.B. ∙ Rothlauf, P.W. ∙ Chen, R.E. ...

Landscape analysis of escape variants identifies SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations that attenuate monoclonal and serum antibody neutralization bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Selective pressure provided by each mAb led to emergence of several escape mutants that clustered within the antigenic supersite i.e., the NTD N terminus, the supersite β-hairpin, and the supersite loop as well as surrounding residues ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Similar to what was previously described for RBD mAbs ( Starr et al., 2020a 75. Starr, T.N. ∙ Greaney, A.J. ∙ Addetia, A. ... Prospective mapping of viral mutations that escape antibodies used to treat COVID-19 Science. 2020; 371 :850-854 Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar , 2020b 76. Starr, T.N. ∙ Greaney, A.J. ∙ Hilton, S.K. ... Deep Mutational Scanning of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Reveals Constraints on Folding and ACE2 Binding Cell. 2020; 182 :1295-1310.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), all viral escape mutants resulted from a single non-synonymous nucleotide mutation.
The four mAbs selected for many shared escape mutations but with a distinct pattern for S2L28, in agreement with the structural observations indicating distinct residues are important for recognition of this antibody. For instance, S2L28 selected for and was uniquely sensitive to the D80N and D253G mutations, whereas it still bound to the K147T mutation, which abrogated binding by S2M28, S2X28, S2X333, and 4A8. S2X28 selected for Y144C/N substitutions, both S2M28 and S2X28 selected for R246G substitutions, and all four mAbs selected for L18P substitutions ( Figure 5 A). Mutations including L18F, D80A, deletion of residue Y144, R246I/T/K, and D253G/Y have been detected in SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, most of them in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, or P.1 lineages, demonstrating the ability of this system to recapitulate variants at naturally occurring S residues ( Davies et al., 2020 29. Davies, N.G. ∙ Barnard, R.C. ∙ Jarvis, C.I. ... Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Tegally et al., 2020 78. Tegally, H. ∙ Wilkinson, E. ∙ Giovanetti, M. ... Emergence and rapid spread of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage with multiple spike mutations in South Africa medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Besides residue substitutions that are expected to impact the epitope/paratope interface directly, we observed escape mutants in the signal peptide region and at cysteine residues 15 and 136. The latter two residues are jointly engaged in a disulfide bond that staples the NTD N terminus against the galectin-like β sandwich ( Figures 2 G–2I). Alteration of this bond (via C15S or C136Y substitutions) abrogates recognition by S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, S2X333, and 4A8 ( Figure 5 B), likely via dislodging this key supersite component, explaining the observed phenotype. These data further suggest that this mechanism of escape is likely to be effective with all mAbs targeting the NTD antigenic supersite.
The predicted SARS-CoV-2 S signal peptide cleavage site occurs between residues T13 and Q14. Signal peptide cleavage site prediction using SignalP5.0 ( Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019 2. Almagro Armenteros, J.J. ∙ Tsirigos, K.D. ∙ Sønderby, C.K. ... SignalP 5.0 improves signal peptide predictions using deep neural networks Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :420-423 Crossref Scopus (777) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggests that the selected S12P escape mutation alters cleavage to occur between residues C15 and V16, thereby eliminating the C15-C136 disulfide bond—similarly to escape mutants at positions C15 and C136. To test the effect of the S12P substitution with purified NTD, we introduced the native signal peptide in the presence or absence of S12P. Similar to direct disruption of the C15-C136 disulfide bond, the S12P signal peptide mutation was found to markedly reduce binding to S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, S2X333, and 4A8 ( Figure 5 B). Mass spectrometry analysis of the S12P mutant was consistent with signal peptide cleavage occurring immediately after residue C15 ( Figures 5 C–5F). The S12F mutation observed in clinical isolates, however, did not affect binding of the NTD-specific mAbs tested ( Figure 4 B). Collectively these findings indicate the involvement of the S signal peptide in immune evasion and warrant closer monitoring of NTD variants.
To understand NTD-specific mAb-mediated inhibition of viral entry, we evaluated the ability of these mAbs to block ACE2 binding as this step correlates with neutralization titers in SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals ( Piccoli et al., 2020 64. Piccoli, L. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

None of the site i-targeting mAbs (S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, and S2X333) blocked binding of SARS-CoV-2 S to immobilized human recombinant ACE2 as measured by biolayer interferometry ( Figure 6 A), excluding interference with engagement of the main entry receptor as mechanism of action. Moreover, these mAbs did not promote shedding of the S 1 subunit from cell-surface-expressed full-length SARS-CoV-2 S ( Figure 6 B), ruling out the possibility of premature S triggering, as previously shown for a SARS-CoV and several SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs ( Huo et al., 2020 46.

Wrobel, A.G. ∙ Benton, D.J. ∙ Hussain, S. ... Antibody-mediated disruption of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5337 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, and S2X333 blocked SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion, indicating they could prevent interaction with an auxiliary receptor, proteolytic activation, or membrane fusion ( Figure S1 G).
To assess whether steric hindrance plays a role in the neutralization activity of S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, and S2X333, we evaluated the neutralization potency of each mAb, in both Fab and IgG formats, against authentic SARS-CoV-2-Nluc ( Figure 6 C). NTD-specific Fabs displayed a marked potency reduction, both in terms of IC 50 values and maximal neutralization plateau reached ( Table S1 ), as compared to IgGs, possibly due to reduced avidity as observed by surface plasmon resonance ( Figure 6 D). Since the Fabs could still partially neutralize SARS-CoV-2, at least part of the observed neutralization activity results from direct interaction with their respective epitopes. It is possible that NTD-specific mAb-mediated neutralization further relies on the steric hindrance provided by Fc positioning, similar to what was observed for anti-hemagglutinin influenza A virus neutralizing mAbs ( Xiong et al., 2015 102. Xiong, X. ∙ Corti, D. ∙ Liu, J. ... Structures of complexes formed by H5 influenza hemagglutinin with a potent broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :9430-9435 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next examined potential additive, antagonistic, or synergistic effects of NTD- and RBD-targeting mAbs, as mAb synergy was previously described for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization ( Pinto et al., 2020 65. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ; ter Meulen et al., 2006 80. ter Meulen, J. ∙ van den Brink, E.N. ∙ Poon, L.L. ... Human monoclonal antibody combination against SARS coronavirus: synergy and coverage of escape mutants PLoS Med. 2006; 3 :e237 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cocktails of S2X333 with S309, S2E12, or S2M11 additively prevented entry of SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV pseudotyped virus in Vero E6 cells ( Figures S5 A–S5C). This additive effect was also observed between S2X333 and S309 using authentic SARS-CoV-2 at 24 h post-infection in Vero E6 cells ( Figure S5 D). These results are consistent with RBD- and NTD-targeting mAbs mediating inhibition by distinct mechanisms and demonstrate that they could be used as cocktails for prophylaxis or therapy.
Since Fc-mediated effector functions contribute to protection by promoting viral clearance and anti-viral immune responses in vivo ( Bournazos et al., 2020 12.

Human neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 require intact Fc effector functions and monocytes for optimal therapeutic protection Cell. 2020; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), we evaluated the ability of site i-targeting mAbs to trigger activation of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa as a proxy for Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), respectively. S2L28, S2M28, S2X28, and S2X333 promoted dose-dependent FcγRIIa- and FcγRIIIa-mediated signaling to levels comparable to those of the highly effective mAb S309 ( Pinto et al., 2020 65. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 6 E and 6F). In contrast, the non-neutralizing site vi-targeting S2M24 mAb did not promote FcγR-mediated signaling, possibly due to the different orientation relative to the membrane of the effector cells in comparison to site i-specific mAbs ( Figures 6 E and 6F). These findings suggest that besides their neutralizing activity, mAbs recognizing site i can exert a protective activity via promoting Fc-mediated effector functions.
To evaluate the protective efficacy of NTD-directed mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo , we selected the S2X333 mAb for a prophylactic study in a Syrian hamster model ( Boudewijns et al., 2020 10. Boudewijns, R. ∙ Thibaut, H.J. ∙ Kaptein, S.J.F. ... STAT2 signaling restricts viral dissemination but drives severe pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5838 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mAb was administered at 4 and 1 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection 48 h before intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Four days later, lungs were collected for the quantification of viral RNA and infectious virus titers. Prophylactic administration of S2X333 at a dose of 4 mg/kg decreased the amount of viral RNA detected in the lungs by ∼3 orders of magnitude, compared to hamsters receiving a control mAb ( Figure 7 A). Viral replication in the lungs was completely abrogated for most of the animals at both doses tested ( Figure 7 B). However, although all animals had similar serum mAb concentrations within each group, infectious viral titers were not decreased relative to the control group for 1 and 4 hamsters administered with S2X333 at 1 and 4 mg/kg, respectively ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Based on the aforementioned variability and mutation tolerance of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD, we hypothesized that S2X333 escape mutants might have been selected in these animals. Sequencing of the viral RNA extracted from the lungs of one outlier from each group administered with S2X333 revealed an S deletion encompassing position Y144 (within site i) in comparison to the input virus or the animal from the control group. The deletion corresponds to 4 and 2 amino acids for the animals treated with 1 (LGVY 144 ) and 4 mg/kg (VY 144 ), respectively ( Figure S6 ). These results show that potent NTD mAbs targeting the antigenic supersite (site i) impose a selection pressure driving viral evolution to escape neutralization. Overall, these data show that low doses of anti-NTD mAbs provide remarkable prophylactic activity in vivo , comparable to best-in-class RBD-specific mAbs S2E12 and S2M11 ( Tortorici et al., 2020 83. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Beltramello, M. ∙ Lempp, F.A. ... Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms Science. 2020; 370 :950-957 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with their potent in vitro neutralizing activity. We anticipate that the protection efficacy of S2X333 (and related NTD mAbs) would be further enhanced in humans due to an optimal matching with human Fcγ receptors. However, our results also indicate that potent NTD mAbs targeting the antigenic supersite (site i) impose a selection pressure driving viral evolution to escape neutralization.

Section: Discussion

The data herein demonstrate that neutralizing NTD-targeting mAbs represent a key aspect of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and account for 5%–20% of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific mAbs cloned from memory B cells isolated from the PBMCs of three COVID-19 individuals. Analysis of a large panel of neutralizing and non-neutralizing mAbs led us to define an antigenic map of the heavily glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 NTD, in which six antigenic sites (i–vi) were identified. We found that all the neutralizing mAbs from the three donors investigated, along with the mAbs 4A8 ( Chi et al., 2020 19. Chi, X. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, J. ... A neutralizing human antibody binds to the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :650-655 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ), FC05 ( Zhang et al., 2020 104. Zhang, L. ∙ Cao, L. ∙ Gao, X.-S. ... A proof of concept for neutralizing antibody-guided vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and CM25 ( Voss et al., 2020 84.

Prevalent, protective, and convergent IgG recognition of SARS-CoV-2 non-RBD spike epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent plasma bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), target the same antigenic supersite (site i) using various germline V genes, thereby providing examples of convergent solutions to NTD-targeted mAb neutralization. We show that a highly potent NTD mAb provides prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge of Syrian hamsters showcasing that this class of mAbs can be a critical barrier to infection and are promising clinical candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, previous work on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) established that the NTD is the target of several potent and protective neutralizing mAbs and an attractive target for vaccine design ( Chen et al., 2017 18.

Our cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 S bound to the ultrapotent RBD-specific mAb S2M11 and to S2X333, S2M28, or S2L28, together with evidence of additive neutralizing effect of RBD- and NTD-targeted mAbs, provide proof of concept for implementing countermeasures using mAb cocktails targeting both the NTD and the RBD and potentially also for vaccine design. As several examples of single amino acid mutations reducing or completely abrogating neutralization by immune sera have been reported ( Li et al., 2020 54. Li, Q. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Nie, J. ...

Weisblum, Y. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Zhang, F. ... Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants eLife. 2020; 9 :e61312 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), we propose that combinations of mAbs targeting distinct domains might reduce the likelihood of emergence of escape mutants, as previously demonstrated for MERS-CoV ( Wang et al., 2018 89. Wang, L. ∙ Shi, W. ∙ Chappell, J.D. ... Importance of Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Multiple Antigenic Sites on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein To Avoid Neutralization Escape J. Virol. 2018; 92 :e02002-17 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we show that site i-targeting NTD neutralizing mAbs efficiently activate FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa in vitro . Fc-mediated effector functions can be affected by the epitope specificity of the mAbs ( Piccoli et al., 2020 64. Piccoli, L. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Mapping Neutralizing and Immunodominant Sites on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain by Structure-Guided High-Resolution Serology Cell. 2020; 183 :1024-1042.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ), highlighting the importance of the orientation of the S-bound Fc fragments for efficient FcγR cross-linking and engagement. The site vi-targeting NTD mAb S2M24 did not activate either FcγRIIa or FcγRIIIa, presumably due to the different angle of approach. The contribution of Fc-mediated effector functions could further enhance the prophylactic activity of potent NTD-specific mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in humans as demonstrated for two RBD-specific SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs ( Schäfer et al., 2021 71. Schäfer, A. ∙ Muecksch, F. ∙ Lorenzi, J.C.C. ... Antibody potency, effector function, and combinations in protection and therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo J. Exp.

The emergence and fixation of SARS-CoV-2 D614G yielded a virus mutant with enhanced ACE2 binding, transmissibility, and replication but without marked changes of antigenicity ( Hou et al., 2020 44. Hou, Y.J. ∙ Chiba, S. ∙ Halfmann, P. ...

Structural and Functional Analysis of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variant Cell. 2020; 183 :739-751.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, we observed that several variants detected in circulating SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates reduced or abrogated recognition by some NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. For instance, the L18F substitution, which has a prevalence of 10% among sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes and is present in the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages initially identified in South Africa and Brazil ( Tegally et al., 2020 78. Tegally, H. ∙ Wilkinson, E. ∙ Giovanetti, M. ... Emergence and rapid spread of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage with multiple spike mutations in South Africa medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), would escape S2L28-mediated neutralization. The deletion of residue Y144 found in 13% of circulating SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, including the B.1.1.7 lineage originally detected in the UK before being identified in numerous other countries ( Davies et al., 2020 29. Davies, N.G. ∙ Barnard, R.C. ∙ Jarvis, C.I. ... Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), would circumvent neutralization by S2M28, S2X28, S2X333, and 4A8 ( Collier et al., 2021 23. Collier, D.A. ∙ De Marco, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 to mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). Using selection of viral escape mutants and structural analysis, we identified additional key residues for binding of neutralizing mAbs, such as S12 (indirectly) and R246, for which natural variants are reported and are thus expected to participate in neutralization escape. The finding that multiple circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants map to the NTD, including several of them in the antigenic supersite (site i), suggests that the NTD is under selective pressure from the host humoral immune response. This is further supported by the identification of NTD deletions within the antigenic supersite (site i) in immunocompromised hosts with prolonged infections ( Avanzato et al., 2020 4. Avanzato, V.A. ∙ Matson, M.J. ∙ Seifert, S.N. ...

Recurrent deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein drive antibody escape Science. 2021; 371 :1139-1142 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), the in vitro selection of SARS-CoV-2 S escape variants with NTD mutations that decrease the neutralization potency of COVID-19 convalescent patient sera ( Andreano et al., 2020 3.

Weisblum, Y. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Zhang, F. ... Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants eLife. 2020; 9 :e61312 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the escape mutants reported here. Collectively, these data indicate that the mutations and deletions accumulated in the NTDs of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages are a direct result of mAb-mediated selective pressure in infected hosts. We propose that mAb cocktails comprising S2L28 plus S2M28, S2X28, or S2X333 could provide broad protection against some SARS-CoV-2 variants as these mAbs are susceptible to distinct sets of SARS-CoV-2 S mutations, as previously proposed for RBD-specific mAbs ( Greaney et al., 2020 36.

The cryo-EM maps, X-ray diffraction data and atomic models have been deposited at the Electron Microscopy Data Bank and the PDB with accession codes listed in the Key Resources Tables.
Cell lines used in this study were obtained from ATCC (HEK293T and Vero-E6) or ThermoFisher Scientific (Expi CHO cells, FreeStyle 293-F cells and Expi293F cells).
Samples from three SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, designates as donors L (male, 34 years-old), M (female, 50 years-old), and X (male, 52 years-old), were obtained under study protocols approved by the local Institutional Review Boards (Canton Ticino Ethics Committee, Switzerland, the Ethical committee of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy). All donors provided written informed consent for the use of blood and blood components (such as PBMCs, sera or plasma).
Samples were collected 14 and 52 days after symptoms onset for donor L and M, respectively. Blood drawn from donor X was obtained at day 36, 48, 75 and 125 after symptoms onset.
SARS-CoV-2 NTD was sub-cloned with E. coli DH10B Competent Cells into pCMV using primers NTD_fwd and NTD_rev. The resulting construct was mutated by PCR mutagenesis to generate C15S, 69/70del, D80A/N, G142D, N149Q, D253G/Y, T19A, R246A, L18F/P, H146Y, A222V, Y144del, S254F, S255F, K147T, C136Y, and the NTD construct with native signal peptide with and without S12P/F, using the eponymously named primers ( Key Resources Table ). The genes encoding for the Sarbecovirus S proteins tested were cloned in the phCMV1 or pcDNA.3 vectors, and the gene for the C-terminally his-tagged ectodomain of P-GD S was cloned into pCMV ( Key Resources Table ). Plasmid sequences were verified by Genewiz sequencing facilities (Brooks Life Sciences).
All SARS-CoV-2 S spike ectodomains were produced in 500 mL cultures of FreeStyle 293-F cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) grown in suspension using FreeStyle 293 expression medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 37°C in a humidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 rpm Cells grown to a density of 2.5 million cells per mL were transfected using PEI (9 μg/mL) and pCMV::SARS-CoV-2_S_ecto_hexapro, pCMV::SARS-CoV-2_S_ecto_2P_DS, pCMV::P-GD_S_ecto, pCMV::SARS-CoV-2_S_ecto_avi, pCMV::SARS-CoV-2_S_D614G_ecto_avi and cultivated for 4 days. The supernatant was harvested and cells were resuspended for another three days, yielding two harvests. S ectodomains were purified from clarified supernatants using a Cobalt affinity column (Cytiva, HiTrap TALON crude), washing with 20 column volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl and eluted with a gradient of 600 mM imidazole. The same protocol was followed for P-GD spike ectodomain purification, except that 25 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 and 300 mM sodium chloride were used instead of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. At this stage, SARS-CoV-2 S with the avi tag (from pCMV::SARS-CoV-2_S_ecto_avi) was biotinylated (BirA biotin-protein ligase standard reaction kit, Avidity) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superose6, GE Healthcare). All purified proteins were then concentrated using a 100 kDa centrifugal filter (Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filters, MilliporeSigma), residual imidazole was washed away by consecutive dilutions in the centrifugal filter unit with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl, and finally concentrated to 5 mg/mL and flash frozen.
All SARS-CoV-2 S NTD domain constructs (residues 14-307) with a C-terminal 8XHis-tag were produced in 100 mL culture of Expi293F Cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) grown in suspension using Expi293 Expression Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 37°C in a humidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 rpm) ( Walls et al., 2020b 87. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells grown to a density of 3 million cells per mL were transfected using pCMV::SARS-CoV-2_S_NTD derivative mutants with the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) with and cultivated for five days at which point the supernatant was harvested. His-tagged NTD domain constructs were purified from clarified supernatants using 2 mL of cobalt resin (Takara Bio TALON), washing with 50 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl and eluted with 600 mM imidazole. Purified protein was concentrated using a 30 kDa centrifugal filter (Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filters, MilliporeSigma), the imidazole was washed away by consecutive dilutions in the centrifugal filter unit with 20 mM HEPES-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl, and finally concentrated to 20 mg/mL and flash frozen. For crystallization, the purified NTD was not frozen but was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex Increase 75 10/300 G, GE Healthcare), concentrated using a new 30 kDa centrifugal filter, and used immediately.
The purpose of intact MS was to verify the n-terminal sequence on four constructs. N-linked glycans were removed by PNGase F after overnight non-denaturing reaction at room temperature. 4 μg of deglycosylated protein was used for each injection on the LC-MS system to acquire intact MS signal after separation of protease and protein by LC (Agilent PLRP-S reversed phase column). Thermo MS (Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap) was used to acquire intact protein mass under denaturing condition. BioPharma Finder 3.2 software was used to deconvolute the raw m/z data to protein average mass.
The purpose of peptide mapping was to identify the post modification on unpaired cysteines. Tryptic digestion was used without adding reducing reagent. 50 μg of deglycosyated protein was denatured (6 M guanidine hydrochloride), alkylated (Iodoacetamide), and buffer exchanged (Zeba spin desalting column) before trypsin digestion. 10 μg of digested peptide was analyzed on the LC-MS system (Agilent AdvanceBio peptide mapping column and Thermo Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap MS) to acquire both MS1 and MS2 data under HCD fragmentation. Peptide mapping data was analyzed on Biopharma Finder 3.2 by searching the possible modifications such as cysteinylation and carbamidomethylation on the cysteines.
PBMCs were isolated from blood draw performed using tubes pre-filled with heparin, followed by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were either used freshly along SARS-CoV2 Spike protein specific memory B cells sorting or stored in liquid nitrogen for later use. Sera were obtained from blood collected using tubes containing clot activator, followed by centrifugation and stored at −80°C.
Starting from freshly isolated PBMCs or upon cells thawing, B cells were enriched by staining with CD19 PE-Cy7 and incubation with anti-PE beads, followed by positive selection using LS columns. Enriched B cells were stained with anti-IgM, anti-IgD, anti-CD14 and anti-IgA, all PE labeled, and prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S with a biotinylated avi tag conjugated to Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 647 (Life Technologies). SARSCoV-2 S-specific IgG+ memory B cells were sorted by flow cytometry via gating for PE negative and Alexa Fluor 647 positive cells. Cells were cultured for the screening of positive supernatants. Antibody VH and VL sequences were obtained by RT-PCR and mAbs were expressed as recombinant human Fab fragment or as IgG1 (G1m3 allotype) carrying the half-life extending M428L/N434S (LS) mutation in the Fc region. ExpiCHO cells were transiently transfected with heavy and light chain expression vectors as previously described ( Pinto et al., 2020 65. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Affinity purification was performed on ÄKTA Xpress FPLC (Cytiva) operated by UNICORN software version 5.11 (Build 407) using HiTrap Protein A columns (Cytiva) for full length human and hamster mAbs and CaptureSelect CH1-XL MiniChrom columns (ThermoFisher Scientific) for Fab fragments, using PBS as mobile phase. Buffer exchange to the appropriate formulation buffer was performed with a HiTrap Fast desalting column (Cytiva). The final products were sterilized by filtration through 0.22 μm filters and stored at 4°C.
To determine specificity of recombinantly produced mAbs, 96 half area well-plates (Corning) were coated over-night at 4°C with of SARS-CoV-2 S, NTD or RBD proteins prepared at 1 μg/mL, 2 μg/mL and 5 μg/mL in PBS pH 7.2, respectively. Plates were then blocked with PBS 1% BSA (Sigma) and subsequently incubated with mAbs serial dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. After 2 washing steps with PBS 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) (Sigma-Aldrich) goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Southern Biotech) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were then washed again with PBS-T and 4-NitroPhenyl phosphate (pNPP, Sigma-Aldrich) substrate added. After 30 min incubation, absorbance at 405 nm was measured by a plate reader (Biotek) and data plotted using Prism GraphPad.
For all other applications reported, the following ELISA procedure was followed: 30 μl of ectodomains (stabilized prefusion trimer) of S or NTD from SARS-CoV-2 were coated on 384 well ELISA plates at 1 ng/μl for 16 h at 4°C. Plates were washed with a 405 TS Microplate Washer (BioTek Instruments) then blocked with 80 μl SuperBlock (PBS) Blocking Buffer (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were then washed and 30 μl antibodies were added to the plates at concentrations between 0.001 and 100,000 ng/mL and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were washed and then incubated with 30 μl of 1/5000 diluted goat anti-human Fc IgG-HRP (Invitrogen). Plates were washed and then 30 μl Substrate TMB microwell peroxidase (Seracare) was added for 4 min at room temperature. The colorimetric reaction was stopped by addition of 30 μl of 1 N HCl. A 450 was read on a Varioskan Lux plate reader (Thermo Scientific).
To generate SARS-CoV-2 S murine leukemia virus pseudotyped virus, HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The next day cells were transfected with a SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein-encoding plasmid harboring the D19 C-terminal truncation ( Ou et al., 2020 63. Ou, X. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Lei, X. ... Characterization of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 on virus entry and its immune cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1620 Crossref Scopus (890) PubMed Google Scholar ), an MLV Gag-Pol packaging construct and the reporter vector pTG-Luc, using the X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 72 h. Supernatant was harvested and cleared from cellular debris by centrifugation at 400 x g, and stored at −80°C.
For neutralization assays, Vero E6 cells were seeded into white 96-well plates (PerkinElmer) at 20,000 cells/well and cultured overnight at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in 100 μl DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The next day, MLV-SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was activated with 10 μg/mL TPCK treated-Trypsin (Worthington Biochem) for 1 h at 37°C. Next, recombinant antibodies at various concentrations were incubated with activated pseudovirus for 1 h at 37°C. The Vero E6 cells were then washed with DMEM, and 50 μL of pseudovirus/mAbs mixes were added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . After incubation, 50 μl of DMEM containing 20% FBS and 2% penicillin/streptomycin was added and the cells were incubated 48 h at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Following these 48 h of infection, culture medium was removed from the cells and 50 μl/well of Bio-Glo (Promega) diluted 1:2 with PBS with Ca 2+ Mg 2+ (Thermo Fisher) was added to the cells and incubated in the dark for 15 min before reading on a Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode plate reader (Biotek). Measurements were done in duplicate, RLU values were converted to percentage of neutralization and plotted with a nonlinear regression curve fit in Graph Prism.
SARS-CoV-2 S (YP 009724390.1), RaTG13 S (QHR63300.2), Pangolin-Guangdong S(QLR06867.1), Pangolin-Guanxi S (EPI ISL 410539), SARS-CoV S (YP 009825051.1), WIV1 S (AGZ48831.1) and WIV16 S (ALK02457.1) pseudotyped VSV viruses were prepared using 293T cells seeded in 10-cm dishes. Briefly, cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep were transfected with the plasmid encoding for the corresponding S glycoprotein using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) following manufacturer’s indications. One day post-transfection, cells were infected with VSV(G ∗ ΔG-luciferase) and after 2 h, infected cells were washed four times with DMEM before adding medium supplemented with anti-VSV-G antibody (I1- mouse hybridoma supernatant diluted 1 to 50, from CRL- 2700, ATCC). Particles were harvested 18 h post-inoculation, clarified from cellular debris by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 5 min and concentrated 10 times using a 30 kDa cut off membrane and used for neutralization experiments, aliquoted and frozen at −80°C until use in neutralization experiments.
For neutralization, stable 293T cells expressing ACE2 ( Crawford et al., 2020 26. Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Eguia, R. ∙ Dingens, A.S. ... Protocol and Reagents for Pseudotyping Lentiviral Particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein for Neutralization Assays Viruses. 2020; 12 :513 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep were seeded at 40,000 cells/well into clear bottom white walled 96-well plates and cultured overnight at 37°C. Twelve-point 3-fold serial dilutions of the corresponding mAb were prepared in DMEM and pseudotyped VSV viruses were added 1:1 to each mAb dilution in the presence of anti-VSV-G antibody from I1- mouse hybridoma supernatant diluted 50 times. After 45 min incubation at 37 ̊C, 40 μl of the mixture was added to the cells and 2 h post-infection, 40 μL DMEM was added to the cells. After 17-20 h 50 μL/well of One-Glo-EX substrate (Promega) was added to the cells and incubated in the dark for 5-10 min prior reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader (ThermoFisher). Measurements were done in duplicate with two independent productions of pseudotyped viruses and RLU values were converted to percentage of neutralization and plotted with a nonlinear regression curve fit in Graph Prism.
Neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 by entry-inhibition assay Neutralization was determined using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc, an infectious clone of SARSCoV-2 (based on strain 2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020) which encodes nanoluciferase in place of the viral ORF7 and demonstrated comparable growth kinetics to wildtype virus ( Xie et al., 2020 101. Xie, X. ∙ Muruato, A.E. ∙ Zhang, X. ... A nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 for rapid neutralization testing and screening of anti-infective drugs for COVID-19 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5214 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Vero E6 cells were seeded into black-walled, clear-bottom 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well and cultured overnight at 37°C. The next day, 9-point 4-fold serial dilutions of mAbs were prepared in infection media (DMEM + 10% FBS). SARS-CoV-2-Nluc was diluted in infection media at a final MOI of 0.1 or 0.01 PFU/cell, added to the mAb dilutions and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Media was removed from the Vero E6 cells, mAb-virus complexes were added and incubated at 37°C for 6 or 24 h. Media was removed from the cells, Nano-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) was added according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, incubated for 10 min at room temperature and the luciferase signal was quantified on a VICTOR Nivo plate reader (Perkin Elmer).
BLI measurements were performed using an Octet Red96 (ForteBio). All reagents were prepared in kinetics buffer (PBS plus 0.01% BSA) at the indicated concentrations.
BLI was used to assess antibody binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 NTD. IgG antibodies were prepared at 2.7 μg/mL and captured on pre-hydrated Protein A biosensors (Sartorius) for 1 min. The biosensors with immobilized antibodies were moved into kinetics buffer with SARS-CoV-2 NTD (concentrations tested: 333.3, 166.6, 83.3, 41.7, 20.8, 10.4, 5.2 nM) for 5 min (i.e., association). The dissociation of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD was then recorded for 9 min in wells containing kinetics buffer. Affinity constants were calculated using a global fit model and results were plotted using GraphPad Prism.
BLI was also used to assess antibody competition studies to define the NTD antigenic map. Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein was prepared at 10 μg/mL in kinetics buffer and loaded on pre-hydrated High Precision Streptavidin SAX Biosensors (Sartorius) for 3 min. NTD mAbs at 20 μg/mL in kinetics buffer were then sequentially added to observe binding competition and signal recorded for 5 min (or 7 min). Given the low responses detected for binding of S2L11 and S2X176 to the S ectodomain trimer, mapping of these mAbs was performed by capturing the purified NTD to BLI biosensors. NTD was prepared at 8 μg/mL and assay performed using the same kinetics conditions described above.
BLI was also used to assess mAb-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S binding to human recombinant ACE2. Before the assay SARS-CoV2 S ectodomain trimer (5 μg/mL) was incubated with tested mAbs (30 μg/mL) or no mAb for 30 min at 37°C. Biotinylated recombinant human ACE2 protein (2 μg/mL) was immobilized on High Precision Streptavidin SAX Biosensors (Sartorius). Next, an association step with S/mAb complexes was performed for 10 min. Results were plotted using GraphPad Prism.
S2X28 mAb was biotinylated using EZ-Link NHS-PEG solid phase biotinylation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and binding to NTD tested to set optimal concentration to be used in the assay after sample desalting using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (ThermoFisher Scietific). Half area 96 well-plates were coated over-night at 4°C with SARS-CoV-2 NTD diluted at 2 μg/mL in PBS. After a blocking step with Blocker Casein (ThermoFisher Scientific), serial plasma dilutions in Blocker Casein were incubated 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated S2X28 was added at a concentration achieving 70% of maximal binding and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Alkaline-phosphatase conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was diluted at 0.5 μg/mL in Blocker Casein and added on plates previously washed 4 times with PBS 0.05%Tween 20. After 30 min incubation, plates were washed and 4-NitroPhenyl phosphate substrate incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured and percentage of inhibition was calculated as follows: (1-(OD sample-OD neg ctr)/ (OD pos ctr-OD neg ctr)) x100.
SPR binding measurements were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument where purified avi-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S D614G ectodomain trimer was captured using anti-AviTag pAb covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip. The running buffer was Cytiva HBS-EP+ pH 7.4; measurements were performed at 25þC. Affinity/avidity determinations were run as single-cycle kinetics, with a 3-fold dilution series of mAb starting from 300 nM, and each concentration injected for 180 s. Double reference-subtracted data were fit to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore Evaluation software. Fit results for IgG yielded apparent equilibrium dissociation constants due to avidity. For dissociation rates that were too slow to fit, equilibrium dissociation constants are reported as an upper limit.
Immediately before transfection, ExpiCHO-S cells were seeded at 6 × 10 6 cells cells/mL in a volume of 5 mL in a 50 mL bioreactor. Spike coding plasmids were diluted in cold OptiPRO SFM, mixed with ExpiFectamine CHO Reagent (Life Technologies) and added to the cells. Transfected cells were then incubated at 37°C with 8% CO 2 with an orbital shaking speed of 120 RPM (orbital diameter of 25 mm) for 42 h
Transiently transfected ExpiCHO cells were harvested and washed two times in wash buffer (PBS 1% BSA, 2 mM EDTA). Cells were counted, distributed into round bottom 96-well plates (Corning) and incubated with the NTD antibodies at the final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Alexa Fluor647-labeled Goat Anti-Human IgG secondary Ab (Jackson Immunoresearch) was prepared at 1.5 μg/mL added onto cells after two washing steps. Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in wash buffer for data acquisition at ZE5 cytometer (Biorad).
Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96 well plates at 15,000 cells per well in 70 μL DMEM with high glucose and 2.4% FBS (Hyclone). After 16 h at 37°C with 8% CO 2 , the cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2-S-D19_pcDNA3.1 as follows: for 10 wells, 0.57 μg plasmid SARS-CoV-2- S-D19_pcDNA3.1 were mixed with 1.68 μl X-tremeGENE HP in 30 μl OPTIMEM. After 15 min incubation, the mixture was diluted 1:10 in DMEM medium and 30 μL was added per well. A 4-fold serial dilution mAbs was prepared and added to the cells, with a starting concentration of 20 μg/mL. The following day, 30 μL 5X concentrated DRAQ5 in DMEM was added per well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Nine images of each well were acquired with a Cytation 5 equipment for analysis.
mAb-dependent activation of human FcγRs was performed with a bioluminescent reporter assay. ExpiCHO cells stably expressing full-length wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S (target cells) were incubated with different amounts of mAbs. After a 15-min incubation, Jurkat cells stably expressing FcγRIIIa receptor (V158 variant) or FcγRIIa receptor (H131 variant) and NFAT-driven luciferase gene (effector cells) were added at an effector to target ratio of 6:1 for FcγRIIIa and 5:1 for FcγRIIa. Signaling was quantified by the luciferase signal produced as a result of NFAT pathway activation. Luminescence was measured after 20 h of incubation at 37þC with 5% CO2 with a luminometer using the Bio-Glo-TM Luciferase Assay Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega).
CHO cells stably expressing wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S were resuspended in wash buffer (PBS 1% BSA, 2 mM EDTA) and treated with 10 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Worthington Biochem) for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed and distributed into round bottom 96-well plates (90,000 cells/well). MAbs were added to cells at 15 μg/mL final concentration for 180 min at 37°C. Cells were collected at different time points (5, 30, 60, 120 and 180), washed with wash buffer at 4°C, and incubated with 1.5 mg/mL secondary goat anti-human IgG, Fc fragment specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch) on ice for 20 min. Cells were washed and resuspended in wash buffer and analyzed with ZE5 FACS (Bio-rad).
VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimera was used to select for SARS-CoV-2 S monoclonal antibody resistant mutants (MARMS) as previously described ( Case et al., 2020 16. Case, J.B. ∙ Rothlauf, P.W. ∙ Chen, R.E. ... Neutralizing Antibody and Soluble ACE2 Inhibition of a Replication-Competent VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and a Clinical Isolate of SARS-CoV-2 Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28 :475-485.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2020b 57. Liu, Z. ∙ VanBlargan, L.A. ∙ Rothlauf, P.W. ... Landscape analysis of escape variants identifies SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations that attenuate monoclonal and serum antibody neutralization bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Briefly, MARMS were recovered by plaque isolation on Vero cells with the indicated mAb in the overlay. The concentration of mAb in the overlay was determined by neutralization assays at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. Escape clones were plaque-purified on Vero cells in the presence of mAb, and plaques in agarose plugs were amplified on MA104 cells with the mAb present in the medium. Viral stocks were amplified on MA104 cells at an MOI of 0.01 in Medium 199 containing 2% FBS and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.7 (Millipore Sigma) at 34°C. Viral supernatants were harvested upon extensive cytopathic effect and clarified of cell debris by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min. Aliquots were maintained at −80°C. Viral RNA was extracted from VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutant viruses using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN), and S was amplified using OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN). The mutations were identified by Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ). Their resistance was verified by subsequent virus infection in the presence or absence of antibody. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded into 12 well plates overnight. The virus was serially diluted using DMEM and cells were infected at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were cultured with an agarose overlay in the presence or absence of mAb at 34°C for 2 days. Plates were scanned on a biomolecular imager and expression of eGFP is show at 48 h post-infection.
2.5 μL of 12 mg/mL S2M11 Fab, 2.5 μL of 12 mg/mL NTD Fab, and 6 μL of 5 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S (specifically the hexapro construct ( Hsieh et al., 2020 45. Hsieh, C.L. ∙ Goldsmith, J.A. ∙ Schaub, J.M. ... Structure-based design of prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes Science. 2020; 369 :1501-1505 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar )) were incubated together for 30 min at 37°C. Alternatively, 3 μL of 3 mg/mL S2X28 Fab, and 3 μL of 1 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 2P DS S ( McCallum et al., 2020 58. McCallum, M. ∙ Walls, A.C. ∙ Bowen, J.E. ... Structure-guided covalent stabilization of coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimers in the closed conformation Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :942-949 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) were incubated together for 30 min at 37°C. Unbound Fab was then washed away with three consecutive dilutions in 400 μL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl over a 100 kDa centrifugal filter (Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filters, MilliporeSigma). The complex was concentrated to 1.2 mg/mL and 3 μL was applied onto a freshly glow discharged 2.0/2.0 UltraFoil grid (200 mesh), plunge frozen using a vitrobot MarkIV (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a blot force of −1 and 6.5 s blot time at 100% humidity and 23°C.
Data were acquired using the Leginon software ( Suloway et al., 2005 77. Suloway, C. ∙ Pulokas, J. ∙ Fellmann, D. ... Automated molecular microscopy: the new Leginon system J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151 :41-60 Crossref Scopus (876) PubMed Google Scholar ) to control a FEI Titan Krios or Glacios transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detectors and operated at 300 kV with a Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter or at 200 kV, respectively. For both microscopes, the dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in 50 frames of 200 ms. For the Krios, ∼3000 micrographs were acquired for each session with a super-resolution pixel size of 0.525 Å with a defocus range between −0.8 and −2.0 μm. For the Glacios, ∼100 micrographs with a pixel size of 1.16 Å were collected in a single session with a defocus range between −0.8 and −2.0 μm.
Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function parameters, particle picking and extraction (with a box size of 400 pixels 2 ) were carried out using Warp ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 79. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). At this stage, the pixel size was binned to 1.05 Å for data collected from the Krios. Reference-free 2D classification was performed using cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 67. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (936) PubMed Google Scholar ) to select well-defined particle images. 3D classification with 50 iterations each (angular sampling 7.5þ for 25 iterations and 1.8þ with local search for 25 iterations) were carried out using Relion ( Zivanov et al., 2018 108. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (974) PubMed Google Scholar ) without imposing symmetry to separate distinct SARS-CoV-2 S conformations. 3D refinements were carried out using non-uniform refinement along with per-particle defocus refinement in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2020 68. Punjani, A. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Fleet, D.J. Non-uniform refinement: adaptive regularization improves single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :1214-1221 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) before particle images were subjected to Bayesian polishing using Relion ( Zivanov et al., 2019 109. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. A Bayesian approach to beam-induced motion correction in cryo-EM single-particle analysis IUCrJ. 2019; 6 :5-17 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). To accommodate the resolution of the S/S2M11/S2X333 dataset, at the polishing stage the box size was adjusted to 600 Å while the pixel size was binned to 0.896 Å. Another round of non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC was performed, followed by global and per-particle defocus refinement and again non-uniform refinement. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143 criterion and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution ( Scheres and Chen, 2012 72.

Crystals of S2M28 Fab with SARS-CoV-2 NTD were identified by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method, set-up by hand with MCSG-1 crystallization screen (Anatrace). Optimized crystals were generated with 1 μl of 5.7 mg/mL Fab and 4 mg/mL NTD in 20 mM HEPES-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl plus 1 μl mother liquor solution containing 0.2 M Ammonium Sulfate, 0.1 M Sodium Citrate pH 4.75, 25% (w/v) PEG4000. Crystals were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen using the mother liquor solution supplemented with 17.5% (w/v) xylitol as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected on synchrotron beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source, and processed with the XDS software package ( Kabsch, 2010 50. Kabsch, W. XDS Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (9282) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using Phenix-Phaser ( McCoy et al., 2007 60. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (12556) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the S/S2M11/S2M28 cryoEM structure. Several subsequent rounds of model building and refinement were performed using Coot ( Casañal et al., 2019 15. Casañal, A. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Emsley, P. Current developments in Coot for macromolecular model building of Electron Cryo-microscopy and Crystallographic Data Protein Sci. 2019; 29 :1069-1078 Google Scholar ) and Phenix-Refine ( Adams et al., 2010 1.

KU LEUVEN R&D has developed and validated a SARS-CoV-2 Syrian Golden hamster infection model ( Boudewijns et al., 2020 10. Boudewijns, R. ∙ Thibaut, H.J. ∙ Kaptein, S.J.F. ... STAT2 signaling restricts viral dissemination but drives severe pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5838 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The SARS-CoV-2 isolate used in this study (BetaCoV/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020-EPI ISL 109 407976|2020-02-03), was recovered from a nasopharyngeal swab taken from a RT-qPCR confirmed asymptomatic patient who returned from Wuhan, China at the beginning of February 2020. A close relatedness with the prototypic Wuhan-Hu-1 2019 SARS-CoV-2 isolate was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Infectious virus was isolated by serial passaging on Huh7 and Vero E6 cells and passage 6 virus was used for the study described here. The titer of the virus stock was determined by end-point dilution on Vero E6 cells by the Reed and Muench method ( Reed and Muench, 1938 69. Reed, L.J. ∙ Muench, H. A SIMPLE METHOD OF ESTIMATING FIFTY PER CENT ENDPOINTS12 Am. J. Epidemiol. 1938; 27 :493-497 Crossref Scopus (14535) Google Scholar ). This work was conducted in the high-containment A3 and BSL3+ facilities of the KU Leuven Rega Institute (3CAPS) under licenses AMV 30112018 SBB 219 2018 0892 and AMV 23102017 SBB 219 20170589 according to institutional guidelines.
Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were purchased from Janvier Laboratories and were housed per two in ventilated isolator cages (IsoCage N Biocontainment System, Tecniplast) with ad libitum access to food and water and cage enrichment (wood block). Housing conditions and experimental procedures were approved by the ethical committee of animal experimentation of KU Leuven (license P065-2020). 6-10 week-old female hamsters were administered by intraperitoneal injection with S2X333 mAb at 1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg 48 h before intranasal infection with 1.89 × 10 6 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) in 50 μl inoculum. Hamsters were monitored for appearance, behavior and weight. At day 4 post infection hamsters were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of 500 μL Dolethal (200 mg/mL sodium pentobarbital, Vétoquinol SA). Lungs were collected, homogenized using bead disruption (Precellys) in 350 μL RLT buffer (RNeasy Mini kit, QIAGEN) and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C) to pellet the cell debris. RNA was extracted using a NucleoSpin kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR was performed on a LightCycler96 platform (Roche) using the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step RTqPCR kit (BioRad) with N2 primers and probes targeting the nucleocapsid ( Boudewijns et al., 2020 10. Boudewijns, R. ∙ Thibaut, H.J. ∙ Kaptein, S.J.F. ... STAT2 signaling restricts viral dissemination but drives severe pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5838 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Standards of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA (IDT) were used to express viral genome copies per mg tissue or per mL serum. To quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles, endpoint titrations were performed on confluent Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates. Viral titers were calculated by the Reed and Muench method ( Reed and Muench, 1938 69. Reed, L.J. ∙ Muench, H. A SIMPLE METHOD OF ESTIMATING FIFTY PER CENT ENDPOINTS12 Am. J. Epidemiol. 1938; 27 :493-497 Crossref Scopus (14535) Google Scholar ) and were expressed as TCID 50 per mg tissue.
To detect escape mutants in the in vivo tests, cDNAs were synthesized from 100 ng vRNAs extracted from lung homogenates using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Spike-cDNA-R oligonucleotide. A gene-specific fragment of 1664 bp encompassing the NTD region of SARS-CoV-2-S was amplified by PCR using Spike-SEQ1-F and Spike-SEQ1-R primers with Q5® Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). Reaction conditions were as follows: 50 μl reaction volume containing 2 μl of cDNA, 1X Q5 Reaction buffer, 200 μM each of four dNTPs (Cytiva Europe GmbH), 0.5 μM of each primer (Microsynth) and 0.02 U/μl of polymerase. PCR conditions: 98°C for 30 s (initial denaturation); 45 cycles of 98°C for 10 s (denaturation), 62°C for 30 s (annealing), 72°C for 60 s (elongation), followed by 1 cycle of 72°C for 2 min (final elongation).PCR products were purified with GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Cytiva Europe GmbH), and sequencing was outsourced at Microsynth (Sanger sequencing) with Spike-SEQ2-F, Spike-SEQ3-F, Spike-SEQ-NTD-R, and Spike-SEQ2-NTD-R primers. Sequence analysis was performed with CLC Main Workbench 21 (QIAGEN) using NCBI NC_045512.2 and virus stock SARS-CoV-2 S -p6-20200525 as reference sequences.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v9) and Microsoft Excel for Windows 10 (v16.0.13001.20254). Statistical differences were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical significance was defined as ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01. EC 50 and IC 50 , values were determined by non-linear regression analysis (log(agonist) versus response - Variable slope (four parameters)).
