Title: HGT is widespread in insects and contributes to male courtship in lepidopterans


Abstract: Summary

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important evolutionary force shaping prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. HGT-acquired genes have been sporadically reported in insects, a lineage containing >50% of animals. We systematically examined HGT in 218 high-quality genomes of diverse insects and found that they acquired 1,410 genes exhibiting diverse functions, including many not previously reported, via 741 distinct transfers from non-metazoan donors. Lepidopterans had the highest average number of HGT-acquired genes. HGT-acquired genes containing introns exhibited substantially higher expression levels than genes lacking introns, suggesting that intron gains were likely involved in HGT adaptation. Lastly, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to edit the prevalent unreported gene LOC105383139 , which was transferred into the last common ancestor of moths and butterflies. In diamondback moths, males lacking LOC105383139 courted females significantly less. We conclude that HGT has been a major contributor to insect adaptation.

Section: Introduction

Insects originated in the Early Ordovician (∼479 million years ago) ( Misof et al., 2014 41. Misof, B. ∙ Liu, S. ∙ Meusemann, K. ... Phylogenomics resolves the timing and pattern of insect evolution Science. 2014; 346 :763-767 Crossref Scopus (1852) PubMed Google Scholar ) and comprise over 50% of all described living animals on Earth ( Stork, 2018 62. Stork, N.E. How many species of insects and other terrestrial arthropods are there on Earth? Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2018; 63 :31-45 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ). This ancient lineage exhibits remarkable diversity in relation to, but not limited to, development, behavior, social organization, and ecology ( Smith et al., 2008 59. Smith, C.R. ∙ Toth, A.L. ∙ Suarez, A.V. ... Genetic and genomic analyses of the division of labour in insect societies Nat. Rev.

Entomol. 2018; 63 :31-45 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some studies have argued that the symbionts of host insects are important contributors to insect diversification (e.g., Archibald, 2015 2. Archibald, J.M.

Genet. 2022; 23 :23-39 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, at least 20% of insect species harbor Wolbachia bacterial endosymbionts, whose genes have been found to be horizontally transmitted into host insect genomes ( Boto, 2014 7. Boto, L. Horizontal gene transfer in the acquisition of novel traits by metazoans Proc. Biol. Sci. 2014; 281 :20132450 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). Drosophila ananassae , for instance, has acquired nearly the entire genome of Wolbachia pipientis via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) ( Hotopp et al., 2007 25. Hotopp, J.C.D. ∙ Clark, M.E. ∙ Oliveira, D.C.S.G. ... Widespread lateral gene transfer from intracellular bacteria to multicellular eukaryotes Science. 2007; 317 :1753-1756 Crossref Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to pieces of symbiont genomes introduced into insects via HGT, some studies have reported the transfer of a single or few genes from fungi, bacteria, plants, and viruses (e.g., Boto, 2014 7. Boto, L. Horizontal gene transfer in the acquisition of novel traits by metazoans Proc. Biol. Sci. 2014; 281 :20132450 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ; Husnik and McCutcheon, 2018 26.

Genet. 2022; 23 :23-39 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). The functions of these transferred genes appear ecologically important; for example, carotenoid biosynthesis genes transferred from fungi to aphids contribute to aphid body coloration ( Moran and Jarvik, 2010 43. Moran, N.A. ∙ Jarvik, T. Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids Science. 2010; 328 :624-627 Crossref Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ), genes that neutralize phenolic glucosides acquired by whiteflies from plants contribute to whitefly detoxification capabilities ( Xia et al., 2021 69. Xia, J. ∙ Guo, Z. ∙ Yang, Z. ... Whitefly hijacks a plant detoxification gene that neutralizes plant toxins Cell. 2021; 184 :1693-1705.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a parasitoid killing factor gene transferred from a virus to lepidopterans contributes to lepidopteran defense ( Gasmi et al., 2021 22. Gasmi, L. ∙ Sieminska, E. ∙ Okuno, S. ... Horizontally transmitted parasitoid killing factor shapes insect defense to parasitoids Science. 2021; 373 :535-541 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given the ecological importance of the few known examples of insect HGT and the enormous magnitude of insect diversity, we undertook a systematic investigation of HGT-acquired genes in insect genomes, including their functions and contributions to insect adaptation. Using a robust and conservative phylogeny-based approach, we systematically identified and characterized horizontally acquired genes in the high-quality genomes of 218 insects, representing 11/19 species-rich orders (i.e., orders with >1,000 described species) ( Stork, 2018 62. Stork, N.E. How many species of insects and other terrestrial arthropods are there on Earth? Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2018; 63 :31-45 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, we asked three questions: (1) what is the distribution of horizontally acquired genes across major insect groups? (2) What factors contribute to the adaptation of HGTs in insect genomes? (3) What are the biological functions of HGTs in insects?

Section: Results

To systematically identify putative HGT-acquired genes in insects, we downloaded 218 publicly available genomes from GenBank and Lepbase ( Challis et al., 2016 11. Challis, R.J. ∙ Kumar, S. ∙ Dasmahapatra, K.K. ... Lepbase: the Lepidopteran genome database Preprint at bioRxiv. 2016; Crossref Google Scholar ) (see STAR Methods ). The genomes of these 218 insects represent 11 of 19 species-rich orders (i.e., orders with >1,000 described species) ( Table S1 ; Stork, 2018 62. Stork, N.E. How many species of insects and other terrestrial arthropods are there on Earth? Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2018; 63 :31-45 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ), including Ephemeroptera (2), Orthoptera (1), Blattodea (4), Thysanoptera (2), Hemiptera (19), Phthiraptera (1), Hymenoptera (68), Coleoptera (19), Lepidoptera (39), Siphonaptera (1), and Diptera (62). We used a robust and conservative phylogeny-based approach to examine the protein sequence of each of the 2,806,851 genes present in the contigs with a length of ≥100 kb from 218 insect genomes for evidence of HGT (e.g., Shen et al., 2018 58. Shen, X.-X. ∙ Opulente, D.A. ∙ Kominek, J. ... Tempo and mode of genome evolution in the budding yeast subphylum Cell. 2018; 175 :1533-1545.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wisecaver et al., 2016 66. Wisecaver, J.H. ∙ Alexander, W.G. ∙ King, S.B. ... Dynamic evolution of nitric oxide detoxifying flavohemoglobins, a family of single-protein metabolic modules in bacteria and eukaryotes Mol. Biol. Evol. 2016; 33 :1979-1987 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 ). We found a total of 1,410 genes in 192 insect genomes that were likely acquired via 741 distinct events from non-metazoan sources ( Figures 1 and S2 ; Table S2 ), including 1,115 (79.0%) genes from bacteria, 194 (13.8%) genes from fungi, 43 (3.0%) genes from plants, 36 (2.6%) genes from viruses, and 22 (1.6%) genes from other lineages.
To gauge the reliability of the inference of these 1,410 HGT-acquired genes, we first used Conterminator v1.c74b5 ( Steinegger and Salzberg, 2020 61. Steinegger, M. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Terminating contamination: large-scale search identifies more than 2, 000, 000 contaminated entries in GenBank Genome Biol. 2020; 21 :115 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ) to detect contamination and found that none of these 1,410 HGT-acquired genes was identified as a potential contaminant. Second, we examined the recovery rate of 54 randomly selected genes from 16 insects representing 8/11 orders, using PCR and Sanger sequencing (see STAR Methods ). Our results show that the rate of PCR success varied between 33.3% and 100% across 16 tested insects, with an average value of 83.3% (45/54 genes) ( Figure 2 A). Third, we compared our list of 1,410 HGT-acquired genes with a list of 193 previously published genes and found that 164/193 (85%) HGT-acquired genes in previous studies were also found in our study. Fourth, we examined the distribution of sequence lengths of the 928 genomic contigs that contain the 1,410 HGT-acquired genes alongside the distribution of sequence lengths of the 89,481 genomic contigs that do not contain HGT-acquired genes. We found that contigs containing the HGT-acquired genes were typically longer than contigs lacking them ( Figure 2 B). Fifth, we examined the distribution of proportions of 1,410 HGT-acquired genes that reside in the 928 contigs and found that none of the 928 contigs contained HGT-acquired genes in frequencies greater than 5% ( Figure 2 C). Finally, we examined the protein sequence similarity between the HGT-acquired genes in the insect recipients and their closest homologs in non-metazoan donors for all 1,410 HGT-acquired genes and found that similarity values ranged between 12% and 89%, with an average value of 39% ( Figure 2 D). Collectively, these results suggest that the list of 1,410 HGT-acquired genes present in the contigs with a length of ≥100 kb is reliable.
When evaluating the 1,410 HGT-acquired genes by the number of genomes included from each order, we found that the order Lepidoptera acquired by far the highest average number of HGT-acquired genes (16 genes per species), followed by the orders Hemiptera (13 genes per species), Coleoptera (6 genes per species), Hymenoptera (3 genes per species), and Diptera (2 genes per species) ( Table S2 ). From the 741 distinct HGT events, 588 were species-specific, whereas the remaining 153 involved two or more species ( Figure S2 ). Of the 153 distinct HGT events that involved two or more species, 63, 20, 15, 12, and 8 were found in the five largest orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera, respectively ( Figure S2 ). When examining genome size, gene content, species divergence time, and genome completeness, we found that the number of HGT-acquired genes exhibited low levels of correlations with genome size, gene content, species divergence time, and genome completeness.
By examining putative donor organisms for 1,410 HGT-acquired genes using a combination of BLAST and phylogenetics, we found that the 1,410 HGT-acquired genes were likely acquired from 670 putative donor species (bacteria: 533/670 [80%], fungi: 74/670 [11%]; plants: 25/670 [4%], viruses: 29/670 [4%], and others: 9/670 [1%]) ( Figure 3 A). Overall, in addition to the common endosymbiotic bacterial genus Wolbachia (3%), the bacterial genera Serratia (3%), Bacillus (2%), Pseudomonas (2%), and Paenibacillus (2%) were also prevalent donor organisms ( Figure 3 A). In addition, some HGT donors were order-specific. For example, the fungal genera Exophiala and Encephalitozoon were Hemiptera-specific and Hymenoptera-specific donors, respectively; the bacterial genera Streptomyces , Listeria , and Erwinia were Coleoptera-specific, Lepidoptera-specific, and Diptera-specific donors, respectively.
Since some studies have argued that the genes in symbionts of the host insects have been horizontally transmitted into the host insect genomes (e.g., Archibald, 2015 2. Archibald, J.M. Endosymbiosis and eukaryotic cell evolution Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :R911-R921 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ; Blondel et al., 2020 5. Blondel, L. ∙ Jones, T.E. ∙ Extavour, C.G. Bacterial contribution to genesis of the novel germ line determinant oskar eLife. 2020; 9 :e45539 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Perreau and Moran, 2022 50. Perreau, J. ∙ Moran, N.A. Genetic innovations in animal–microbe symbioses Nat. Rev. Genet. 2022; 23 :23-39 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), we investigated the association between putative HGT donor organisms and known insect symbionts. Specifically, we calculated the relative abundance of each HGT donor genus as well as the relative abundance of each known symbiont genus in 20 insects (from 7/11 orders) in SymGenDB ( Reyes-Prieto et al., 2015 52. Reyes-Prieto, M. ∙ Vargas-Chávez, C. ∙ Latorre, A. ... SymbioGenomesDB: a database for the integration and access to knowledge on host–symbiont relationships Database. 2015; 2015 :bav109 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the correlation in relative abundance between HGT donor genera and known insect symbiont genera was significant (r = 0.68, p value = 7.6 × 10 −9 ) ( Figure 3 B). This strong correlation still held when we examined the association between all putative HGT donor species and all insect symbiont species, without considering one-to-one corresponding relationships between HGT recipient insects and host insects of the symbionts. These results raise the possibility that symbionts of host insects—especially symbionts in the Rickettsia and Wolbachia lineages—might be involved in transitions of foreign genes into insect genomes.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the 1,410 HGT-acquired genes shows that most were associated with metabolism- and cellular-related terms ( Figure 3 C). In addition to previously reported functions (e.g., detoxification, body coloration, and defense) ( Gasmi et al., 2021 22. Gasmi, L. ∙ Sieminska, E. ∙ Okuno, S. ... Horizontally transmitted parasitoid killing factor shapes insect defense to parasitoids Science. 2021; 373 :535-541 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moran and Jarvik, 2010 43. Moran, N.A. ∙ Jarvik, T. Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids Science. 2010; 328 :624-627 Crossref Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xia et al., 2021 69. Xia, J. ∙ Guo, Z. ∙ Yang, Z. ... Whitefly hijacks a plant detoxification gene that neutralizes plant toxins Cell. 2021; 184 :1693-1705.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found diverse functions that include but are not limited to immunity, courtship behavior, metabolism, nutrition, adaptation to extreme environments, growth, and development. We found similar functional distributions of the GO categories (BP, biological process; CC, cellular component; and MF, molecular function) in the five largest orders in our study.
From the 1,410 HGT-acquired genes, 849 contain 1,534 introns ≥100 bp in length, whereas the remaining 561 lack introns ( Figure 4 A). Comparisons of introns between the genes of putative HGT donor organisms and their HGT insect recipients showed that all 1,534 introns present in the 849 genes were gained after these genes were inserted into insect genomes. Specifically, of the 1,410 HGT-acquired genes, 519 did not contain any introns in HGT donor organisms and recipient insects (i.e., no intron gain or loss); 42 contained 53 introns in HGT donor organisms but did not retain them in recipient insects (i.e., intron loss); 849 lost 245 introns (loss is inferred based on the observation that 245 introns are present in the corresponding genes in HGT donor organisms) but gained 1,534 introns in recipient insects after gene transfers (i.e., intron gain) ( Figure 4 A).
Since the identifications of HGT-acquired genes were based on the protein sequences, the origins of these 1,534 gained introns in the 849 HGT-acquired genes were unknown. To address this question, we carried out BLASTN searches of DNA sequences of introns against a custom database consisting of nucleotide (nt) database at the NCBI as of 20 April 2022, and 218 insect genomes, with an e value cutoff of 1e−5 and the option “-task blastn-short.” We found that 1,013/1,534 (66%) introns had BLAST hits, with an average identity of 86%, whereas 521/1,534 (34%) had no BLAST hits ( Figure 4 B). Further analyses of best hits for the 1,013 introns showed that all best hits came from their native insect genomes. Characterizing the features of these 1,013 gained introns from native insect genomes, we found that 891/1,013 (88%) introns are repeat-rich DNA sequences, including DNA transposons (51.6%), LTR transposons (25.8%), and unclassified repeats (10.6%) ( Figure 4 C).
By characterizing the gene structures of 1,410 HGT-acquired genes in the putative donor and recipient genomes as well as of all native insect genes, we found that the length of HGT-acquired genes in insects was significantly longer than that of their counterparts in HGT donor species, but it was significantly shorter than that of native genes in insects (on average, length of acquired genes in recipient genomes: 5.00 kb, length of transferred genes in HGT donor genomes: 1.54 kb, and length of native genes in recipient genomes: 12.27 kb) ( Figure 4 D). The 1,410 HGT-acquired genes in the putative donor and recipient genomes had similar coding sequence (CDS) lengths compared with all native insect genes (on average, length of CDS in foreign genes in recipient genomes: 1.45 kb, length of CDS in transferred genes in HGT donor genomes: 1.45 kb, and length of CDS in native genes in recipient genomes: 1.46 kb) ( Figure 4 D). By contrast, the length of introns in the 1,410 HGT-acquired genes in the recipient genomes was substantially longer than that in the putative donor genomes but was significantly shorter than that of introns in native genes (on average, length of introns in foreign genes in recipient genomes: 3.55 kb, length of introns in transferred genes in HGT donor genomes: 0.09 kb, and length of introns in native genes in recipient genomes: 10.81 kb) ( Figure 4 D). This trend can be explained by intron gain events (on average, number of introns in foreign genes in recipient insects: 1.43, number of introns in transferred genes in HGT donor species: 0.23, and number of introns in native genes in percipient insects: 5.05) ( Figure 4 D).
To further explore whether intron gains were involved in the adaptation of HGT-acquired genes to insect genomes, we conducted two separate analyses. First, we examined the changes of gene structures of HGT-acquired genes over evolutionary time ( Figure 4 E). Since inferring the time of evolutionary divergence of species-specific HGT-acquired genes is infeasible, we focused on the 822/1,410 HGT-acquired genes that were present in two or more insect species. We found that gene length, intron length, and the number of introns apparently increased over evolutionary time, whereas CDS length did not significantly change over evolutionary time ( Figure 4 E). Second, we compared expression levels of HGT-acquired genes containing introns and HGT-acquired genes lacking introns for transcriptome datasets from each of the 32 insects representing 6/11 orders using 90 publicly available transcriptome data ( Table S3 ). Note that we compared HGT-acquired genes with and without introns only within each transcriptomic dataset (e.g., only using transcriptome data from the same stage and the same tissue for a given species). Of the 32 insect datasets, 26 (81.3%) had on average ∼11-fold higher gene expression levels of HGT-acquired genes containing introns compared with HGT-acquired genes lacking introns, whereas only six (18.7%) had on average ∼4-fold lower gene expression levels of HGT-acquired genes containing introns compared with HGT-acquired genes lacking introns ( Figure 4 F). Collectively, our results show that repeat-rich intron gains from native insect genomes, which enabled these foreign genes to increase their lengths toward the average length of native genes, were likely involved in adaptation of HGTs in insect genomes.
We evaluated the genetic function of the prevalent HGT-acquired gene LOC105383139 in our list, which was acquired by the last common ancestor of moths and butterflies from a donor in the bacterial genus Listeria ( Figure 5 A). This gene belongs to the zinc-binding alcohol dehydrogenase family predicted by the Pfam database ( Mistry et al., 2021 42. Mistry, J. ∙ Chuguransky, S. ∙ Williams, L. ... Pfam: the protein families database in 2021 Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :D412-D419 Crossref Scopus (2813) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the Alphafold2 ( Jumper et al., 2021 30. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (16923) PubMed Google Scholar ), but little is known about its function in either the donor organisms or the recipient insects. The gene family phylogeny of LOC105383139 , which includes sequences of the gene from nearly all examined moths and butterflies, except for the moth Chilo suppressalis and the butterfly Leptidea sinapis , shows that 12 species contain multiple-copy homologs (e.g., Papilio machaon ), whereas 25 species contain only a single-copy homolog (e.g., Plutella xylostella ). After searching all 37 publicly available lepidopteran genomes, we found only six moth and two butterfly genomes that reported sex chromosomes. In all eight genomes, we found that the gene LOC105383139 resides in the autosomes rather than in the sex chromosomes. To evaluate the gene’s function, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to create homozygous mutants (MT-139) at generation 2 (G2) with two sgRNAs in the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella , a serious agricultural pest of crucifer vegetables ( Figure 5 B).
During rearing diamondback moths, we initially found that knockout (MT-139) moths have a ∼5- to 6-fold lower number of offspring but have no significant differences in five developmental phenotypes, including body size, feeding, movement, testis size, and sperm activity ( Figure S3 ), compared with wild-type (WT) moths. To identify underlying causes of the lower number of offspring in MT-139 moths, we first measured the number of eggs produced by emerging MT-139 and WT moths in 48 h. We found that the number of eggs produced by 15 pairs of knockout males (MT-139♂) + knockout females (MT-139♀) was significantly lower than that of eggs produced by 15 pairs of wild-type males (WT♂) + wild-type females (WT♀) (on average, MT-139: 46 eggs and WT: 101 eggs) ( Figure 5 C). However, the number of eggs produced by 15 knockout virgin females (MT-139-virgin) was similar to the number of eggs produced by 15 wild-type virgin females (WT-virgin) (on average, MT-139-virgin: 28 eggs and WT-virgin: 25 eggs) ( Figure 5 C). Next, we examined four developmental stages from eggs to hatching during 70 h. We found that the rate of successfully hatched eggs (stage IV in Figure 5 D) in MT-139 moths was substantially lower than that of successfully hatched eggs in WT moths (MT-139: rate of hatched eggs = 9.5% and WT: rate of hatched eggs = 56%). Among these unsuccessfully hatched eggs in MT-139moths, over 80% of eggs were stuck in stage I (no gastrulation) for 70 h ( Figure 5 D), whereas in WT moths only 35% of eggs were stuck in stage I for 70 h. Strikingly, of the 30 examined pairs of MT-139 moths, 20 (66.7%) were found to have all their eggs stuck in stage I (no gastrulation). However, in WT moths, there were only 4/26 (15.4%) pairs whose eggs were stuck in the stage I. We also examined the developmental stages of unfertilized eggs produced by MT-139-virgin and WT-virgin. We found that all unfertilized eggs were completely stuck in stage I from MT-139-virgin and WT-virgin. These results suggest that the higher proportion of eggs that were stuck in stage I (no gastrulation) from MT-139 moths were likely due to the higher rate of unfertilized eggs in MT-139 moths ( Figure 5 D).
Through further observations, we found that MT-139 moths had apparently lower mating rates than WT moths. To precisely quantify mating behavior, we evaluated courtship index and mating index for WT and MT-139 moths that were 1 day old after emergence for 48 consecutive hours, respectively. Courtship index is the percentage of successfully courted pairs, in which the male moves toward the female with flapping wings and tipping the abdomen, in a given time period ( Xu et al., 2020 70. Xu, J. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Yang, D. ... Regulation of olfactory-based sex behaviors in the silkworm by genes in the sex-determination cascade PLoS Genet. 2020; 16 :e1008622 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mating index is the percentage of successfully mated pairs in which the male copulates with the female for approximately 1 h ( Song et al., 2014 60. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Li, P. ... Analysis of the mating and reproductive traits of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) J. Insect Sci. 2014; 14 :267 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used four treatments for behavioral experiments: WT♂ + WT♀, WT♂ + MT-139♀, MT-139♂ + MT-139♀, and MT-139♂ + WT♀ (each treatment had three replicates using 24 pairs of 1-day-old male and female adult moths) ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Strikingly, we found that MT-139♂ had a significantly lower percentage of courting attempts toward MT-139♀ and WT♀ than WT♂ (on average, percentage of courted pairs, MT-139♂ + MT-139♀: 46%; MT-139♂ + WT♀: 48%; WT♂ + WT♀: 86%; and WT♂ + MT-139♀: 84%) ( Figure 5 E). Moreover, MT-139♂ had a significantly lower percentage of mating with MT-139♀ and WT♀ than WT♂ (on average, percentage of mating pairs, MT-139♂ + MT-139♀: 13%; MT-139♂ + WT♀: 10%; WT♂ + WT♀: 65%; and WT♂ + MT-139♀: 64%) ( Figure 5 F; Table S4 ; Video S1 ).

Behavioral experiments between wild-type and knockout diamondback moths, related to Figure 5
We also examined the role of the gene LOC105383139 in two closely related butterflies ( Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno ) with publicly available courtship data and transcriptome data (eye and brain) in courtship situations ( Merrill et al., 2019 39. Merrill, R.M. ∙ Rastas, P. ∙ Martin, S.H. ... Genetic dissection of assortative mating behavior PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e2005902 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rossi et al., 2020 56. Rossi, M. ∙ Hausmann, A.E. ∙ Thurman, T.J. ... Visual mate preference evolution during butterfly speciation is linked to neural processing genes Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4763 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 ). We found that H. melpomene males, which courted females significantly more than H. cydno males (on average, number of courting episodes toward females in five trials, H. melpomene : 18 and H. cydno : 6) ( Figure S4 A), had a 6.5-fold higher expression level of the gene LOC105383139 compared with H. cydno males (on average, the expression level of the gene LOC105383139 in five male adults, H. melpomene : 130 reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads [RPKM] and H. cydno : 20 RPKM) ( Figure S4 B). Further analyses of the publicly available transcriptome data of 15 pairs of adult male and female lepidopterans revealed that males had significantly higher expression levels of the gene LOC105383139 than females as well ( Figure 5 G). Collectively, these results suggest that one of the functions of the gene LOC105383139 , acquired by the last common ancestor of moths and butterflies via HGT, is the enhancement of male courtship behavior.
The question then arises, what genes interact with the male courtship-associated foreign gene LOC105383139 ? We first quantified the gene’s expression levels at 13 different developmental stages from egg to adult in diamondback moths (see STAR Methods ). Consistent with the results of 15 pairs of publicly available lepidopteran transcriptome data ( Figure 5 G), the qRT-PCR results showed that adult males had the highest expression levels when compared with different developmental stages in male and female moths. In addition, we also examined the expression levels of the foreign gene LOC105383139 in five tissues (antennae, head, thorax, abdomen, and reproductive system) in male moths. Interestingly, we found that the foreign gene was highly expressed in the abdomen and reproductive system but was lowly expressed in the antennae, head, and thorax. Next, we generated transcriptome data of the whole bodies for 1-day-old wild-type male adult (WT male), wild-type female adult (WT female), knockout male adult (MT-139 male), and knockout female adult (MT-139 female). We found that 462 genes were significantly under-expressed and 359 were significantly over-expressed in the MT-139 male versus WT male analysis.
The GO term enrichment analysis reveals that in the MT-139♂ versus WT♂ analysis, the terms courtship behavior, reproductive process, metabolic process, biological regulation, and response to stimulus were significantly enriched in the 462 under-expressed genes, whereas the terms developmental process, localization, metabolic process, and immune system process were significantly enriched in the 359 over-expressed genes ( Figure S5 A). Examination of the biological process of the 462 under-expressed genes in the MT-139♂ versus WT♂ analysis identified nine genes ( FBgn0028572 : quick-to-court, FBgn0003068 : period, FBgn0000535 : ether a go-go, FBgn0263111 : cacophony, FBgn0020277 : lush, FBgn0011279 : odorant-binding protein 69a, FBgn0283510 : peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine-α-amidating lyase 1, FBgn0004573 : 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7, and FBgn0005626 : tyrosine 3-monooxygenase in Drosophila melanogaster ), which could potentially be involved in courtship behavior (GO term: 0007619). By contrast, courtship-associated genes were not found from the set of the 359 over-expressed genes ( Figure S5 A). These results suggest that these nine courtship-associated genes, and possibly other differentially expressed genes, that interact with the foreign gene LOC105383139 might be involved in male courtship behavior, but their roles in diamondback moths deserve further experimental investigations. We also performed analysis of differential gene expression and GO term enrichment for MT-139♀ versus WT♀, and identified 348 genes that were significantly under-expressed and 375 that were significantly over-expressed. However, these differentially under-/over-expressed genes were mostly involved in the metabolic process, developmental process, cellular process, biological regulation, locomotion, response to stimulus, and signaling, but none of them were associated with female mating behaviors, including mate choice (mate recognition and acceptance) and oviposition ( Figure S5 B).

Section: Discussion

In this study, taking advantage of the high-quality genomes of 218 insects representing 11 of 19 species-rich orders (i.e., orders with >1,000 described species) ( Stork, 2018 62. Stork, N.E. How many species of insects and other terrestrial arthropods are there on Earth? Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2018; 63 :31-45 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ), we systematically inferred that 1,410 genes were transmitted via 741 distinct HGT events into insects from non-metazoan (mostly bacterial) sources.
Many previous studies have shown the occurrence of HGT in insects, but their taxon sampling strategies focused on either a few insects of interest or on a specific order of insects (e.g., Crisp et al., 2015 12.

Although these previous efforts are significant in establishing the occurrence and ecological importance of HGT in insects, the use of sparse and sporadic sampling of insect genomes has hampered better understanding of the distribution of HGT-acquired genes across the insect lineage, the largest and most diverse clade comprising >50% of all described animals. Our systematic identification of 1,410 HGTs shows that the order Lepidoptera acquired by far the highest average number of HGT-acquired genes (16 genes per species), followed by the orders Hemiptera (13 genes per species), Coleoptera (6 genes per species), Hymenoptera (3 genes per species), and Diptera (2 genes per species) ( Figure 1 ). In addition, examination of putative HGT donor organisms and known symbionts of host insects revealed that genes in insect symbionts were likely to be horizontally transferred into the host insects ( Figures 3 A and 3B), which is consistent with previous findings ( Archibald, 2015 2.

In general, many studies agree that HGT-acquired genes were involved in adaptation to recipient genomes, but views vary on factors that contribute to the adaptation of these foreign genes in insect genomes (e.g., Arnold et al., 2022 3. Arnold, B.J. ∙ Huang, I.-T. ∙ Hanage, W.P. Horizontal gene transfer and adaptive evolution in bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2022; 20 :206-218 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Husnik and McCutcheon, 2018 26. Husnik, F. ∙ McCutcheon, J.P. Functional horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16 :67-79 Crossref Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, codon usage is an important factor that determines the fate of transferred genes due to the need for compatibility with the transfer RNA (tRNA) pool in the host ( Husnik and McCutcheon, 2018 26. Husnik, F. ∙ McCutcheon, J.P. Functional horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16 :67-79 Crossref Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ). Selection is also considered as the dominant force for the adaptation of HGTs in bacteria, but there is still much debate on whether most transfers are beneficial, neutral, or even deleterious to the recipients ( Arnold et al., 2022 3. Arnold, B.J. ∙ Huang, I.-T. ∙ Hanage, W.P. Horizontal gene transfer and adaptive evolution in bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2022; 20 :206-218 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, a recent study argued that introns did not give rise to the significant difference in gene length between foreign genes and native genes and did not play an important role in adaptations of foreign genes to recipient phytoplankton genomes ( Fan et al., 2020 21. Fan, X. ∙ Qiu, H. ∙ Han, W. ... Phytoplankton pangenome reveals extensive prokaryotic horizontal gene transfer of diverse functions Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 :eaba0111 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, we found that 849/1,410 HGT-acquired genes contain repeat-rich introns, which were likely acquired from the native insect genomes after the initial gene transfers ( Figures 4 A–4C). Moreover, a comparison of gene structures between HGT-acquired genes in the context of divergence times shows that intron gain events occurred over evolutionary time, which enabled these foreign genes to increase their lengths toward the average length of native genes ( Figures 4 D and 4E). More importantly, HGT-acquired genes containing introns exhibited substantially higher expression levels than genes lacking introns ( Figure 4 F), which is consistent with previous studies in diverse organisms (green microalgae, plants, and insects) showing that intron gains can enhance gene expression levels ( Baier et al., 2018 4. Baier, T. ∙ Wichmann, J. ∙ Kruse, O. ... Intron-containing algal transgenes mediate efficient recombinant gene expression in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :6909-6919 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ; Husnik et al., 2013 27.

Rose, A.B. ∙ Emami, S. ∙ Bradnam, K. ... Evidence for a DNA-based mechanism of intron-mediated enhancement Front. Plant Sci. 2011; 2 :98 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, our results suggest that the repeat-rich introns acquired from native insect genomes were likely involved in adaptation of HGTs to recipient genomes.
Many previous studies have reported instances of HGT-acquired genes contributing to important traits in insects, although only some of them constructed the mutants to verify function due to the challenge in genome editing for non-model insects ( Dai et al., 2021 13. Dai, X. ∙ Kiuchi, T. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... Horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication of β-fructofuranosidase confer lepidopteran insects metabolic benefits Mol. Biol.

Among these previously reported HGTs, three are well studied and have shown that transferred genes can have ecologically diverse functions, including in body coloration ( Moran and Jarvik, 2010 43. Moran, N.A. ∙ Jarvik, T. Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids Science. 2010; 328 :624-627 Crossref Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ), detoxification ( Xia et al., 2021 69.

Whitefly hijacks a plant detoxification gene that neutralizes plant toxins Cell. 2021; 184 :1693-1705.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ), and defense ( Gasmi et al., 2021 22. Gasmi, L. ∙ Sieminska, E. ∙ Okuno, S. ... Horizontally transmitted parasitoid killing factor shapes insect defense to parasitoids Science. 2021; 373 :535-541 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, the set of 1,410 HGT-acquired genes not only included the majority (∼85%) of previously reported cases (including the three examples cited in the previous sentence) but also provided additional diverse functions, which include but are not limited to metabolism, courtship behavior, nutrition, adaptation to extreme environment, growth, and development. In the list of 1,410 HGT-acquired genes, the prevalent gene LOC105383139 , which was horizontally introduced into nearly all moths and butterflies from a donor in the bacterial genus Listeria , was validated by the CRISPR-Cas9 system and a series of behavioral experiments in the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella . Surprisingly, we found that male diamondback moths lacking the gene LOC105383139 courted female ones significantly less, showing a reduced level of mating behavior. The master genes fruitless and doublesex were well studied in courtship behavior in the fruit fly and silkworm ( Anderson, 2016 1. Anderson, D.J.

Yamamoto, D. ∙ Koganezawa, M. Genes and circuits of courtship behaviour in Drosophila males Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14 :681-692 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ), but none of the previous studies reported that a foreign gene can be also associated with courtship behavior.
In summary, our results provide a resource of HGT-acquired genes in insects. This resource will enable users to study the functions of these foreign genes not only in our examined species but also in other insects. Moreover, the tempo and mode of evolution of these HGT-acquired genes insects also provide guidelines for insect biological science, insect pest control, and insect biodiversity.
Our study suggests that HGT is widespread in insect genomes and has likely contributed to insect adaptation. There are a few limitations to our study. First, the disproportional genome sampling across different insect orders could potentially influence the precision of our estimates of the number of HGT-acquired genes and HGT donor sources (e.g., symbionts) between orders. Second, although we deemed that intron gains from insect native genomes were likely involved in adaptation of HGTs in insect genomes, we cannot exclude alternative explanations of how foreign genes evolved in insect genomes, such as selective constraint under rapid adaptation to environmental change ( Woods et al., 2020 67. Woods, L.C. ∙ Gorrell, R.J. ∙ Taylor, F. ... Horizontal gene transfer potentiates adaptation by reducing selective constraints on the spread of genetic variation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :26868-26875 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, the disruption of the gene LOC105383139 in diamondback moths significantly reduces males’ courting of females, but its functional role in other lepidopteran species has not yet been validated with genome editing technology. As more insect genomes are sequenced and genome editing techniques enable genetic manipulation experiments in lepidopterans (e.g., butterflies) at higher levels of efficiency, these limitations could be experimentally tested.

Plutella xylostella that were originally collected in 2015 from the cabbage field in Hangzhou (30°30’N, 120°09’E), Zhejiang Provence, China, were reared at 25 ± 1°C and 65 ± 5% relative humidity under a 16-hour light and 8-hour dark photoperiod. Larvae were fed with cabbage, while adults were supplied with 10% honey solution. Both one day old male and female adults after emergence were used in this study.
To collect the greatest possible set of genome representatives of the class Insecta as of 17 November 2020, we used “insects” as search term in NCBI’s Genome Browser ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse !/eukaryotes/insects) to obtain the basic information of species name, assembly accession number, assembly release date, assembly level (e.g., contig, scaffold, etc.), and GenBank FTP access number. For species with multiple genomes sequenced, we only included the genome that has publicly available annotation, the highest assembly level, and the latest release date. In addition, we also included high-quality genomes of all 12 butterflies in Lepbase ( http://lepbase.org/ ) ( Challis et al., 2016 11. Challis, R.J. ∙ Kumar, S. ∙ Dasmahapatra, K.K. ... Lepbase: the Lepidopteran genome database Preprint at bioRxiv. 2016; Crossref Google Scholar ). Collectively, we included 218 insects representing 11 of 19 species-rich orders (i.e., orders with >1,000 described species) ( Stork, 2018 62. Stork, N.E. How many species of insects and other terrestrial arthropods are there on Earth? Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2018; 63 :31-45 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ), including Ephemeroptera (2), Orthoptera (1), Blattodea (4), Thysanoptera (2), Hemiptera (19), Phthiraptera (1), Hymenoptera (68), Coleoptera (19), Lepidoptera (39), Siphonaptera (1), and Diptera (62). Analysis of genome assembly completeness reveals that 212 of 218 (∼97%) genomes have ≥ 90% of the 1,367 preselected genes that are single-copy in at least 90% of the 75 reference insect genomes in OrthoDB v10 ( Kriventseva et al., 2019 32.

Detailed information is given in Table S1 .
To detect insect genes that may have been horizontally acquired from non-metazoan organisms, we employed a robust and conservative phylogeny-based approach ( Figure S1 ; Gonçalves et al., 2018 23. Gonçalves, C. ∙ Wisecaver, J.H. ∙ Kominek, J. ... Evidence for loss and reacquisition of alcoholic fermentation in a fructophilic yeast lineage eLife. 2018; 7 :e33034 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shen et al., 2018 58.

Wisecaver, J.H. ∙ Alexander, W.G. ∙ King, S.B. ... Dynamic evolution of nitric oxide detoxifying flavohemoglobins, a family of single-protein metabolic modules in bacteria and eukaryotes Mol. Biol. Evol. 2016; 33 :1979-1987 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our approach incorporated the information from each gene’s Alien Index (AI) score, which compared the similarity of the gene between specified ingroup and outgroup taxa (e.g., insects and bacteria, respectively), the distribution of outgroup taxa in the list of each gene’s top 1,000 blast hits against the Refseq database (last accessed January 10, 2021), as well as each gene’s placement in a maximum likelihood phylogenic tree with its 1,000 most similar homologs. To avoid spurious results due to the presence of small genomic fragments of contaminant organisms in our genome assemblies, we limited our analyses to those genes that resided in genomic contigs or scaffolds that were ≥ 100 kb, which was adopted from our previous study ( Shen et al., 2018 58. Shen, X.-X. ∙ Opulente, D.A. ∙ Kominek, J. ... Tempo and mode of genome evolution in the budding yeast subphylum Cell. 2018; 175 :1533-1545.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ). This filter resulted in the analysis of 2,806,851 of 3,185,017 (88.1%) protein-coding genes in 218 insect genomes.
For each gene’s protein sequence, we evaluated whether it had been horizontally acquired using a two-step workflow following the pipeline provided by Shen et al., ( Shen et al., 2018 58. Shen, X.-X. ∙ Opulente, D.A. ∙ Kominek, J. ... Tempo and mode of genome evolution in the budding yeast subphylum Cell. 2018; 175 :1533-1545.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 ). Briefly, in step 1 we first carried out a BLASTP in DIAMOND v 2.0.9 ( Buchfink et al., 2021 9. Buchfink, B. ∙ Reuter, K. ∙ Drost, H.-G. Sensitive protein alignments at tree-of-life scale using DIAMOND Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :366-368 Crossref Scopus (1124) PubMed Google Scholar ) search against a custom database (Refseq+) consisting of the reference protein sequences (Refseq) (last accessed January 10, 2021) and all insect protein sequences, with an e-value cutoff of 10 -10 . We next used HGTfinder v1 ( Shen et al., 2018 58. Shen, X.-X. ∙ Opulente, D.A. ∙ Kominek, J. ... Tempo and mode of genome evolution in the budding yeast subphylum Cell. 2018; 175 :1533-1545.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ) to: (a) assign taxonomic information to each BLAST hit from the NCBI Taxonomy database, and then (b) parse the BLAST hits, based on their taxonomic information, into three different lineages (RECIPIENT: insects; GROUP: other metazoans; OUTGROUP: non-metazoan) so as to obtain three values: bbhO (BLAST bitscore of the best hit in OUTGROUP lineage), bbhG (bitscore of the best hit in GROUP lineage but not in RECIPIENT lineage), and maxB (bitscore of the query to itself). Using this information, we next calculated: (a) the Alien Index: 𝐀 ⁢ 𝐈 = ( 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑂 / 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝐵 ) − ( 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝐺 / 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝐵 ) , and (b) the percentage of species from OUTGROUP lineage ( outg_pct ) in the list of the top 1,000 hits that have different taxonomic species names. From the 2,806,851 genes analyzed, 28,822 genes passed the cutoffs AI value > 0 and outg_pct ≥ 80%. In step 2, we retrieved the 1,000 most similar homologs from the Refseq+ database (see above), aligned them by the MAFFT, version 7.299 ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 31. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (28533) PubMed Google Scholar ), with “--auto” option, and trimmed ambiguously aligned regions using trimAl v1.4 ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 10. Capella-Gutiérrez, S. ∙ Silla-Martínez, J.M. ∙ Gabaldón, T. trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1972-1973 Crossref Scopus (6639) PubMed Google Scholar ) with “-automated1” option. We then used the resulting alignment to infer the ML tree using IQ-TREE 1.6.12 ( Nguyen et al., 2015 44. Nguyen, L.-T. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ von Haeseler, A. ... IQ-TREE: A fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating maximum-likelihood phylogenies Mol. Biol. Evol. 2015; 32 :268-274 Crossref Scopus (15108) PubMed Google Scholar ) with its best-fitting model of amino acid evolution and 1000 ultrafast bootstrapping replicates ( Minh et al., 2013 40. Minh, B.Q. ∙ Nguyen, M.A.T. ∙ von Haeseler, A. Ultrafast approximation for phylogenetic bootstrap Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :1188-1195 Crossref Scopus (2911) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lastly, we rooted each ML tree at the midpoint using the ape and phangorn R packages ( Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996 28. Ihaka, R. ∙ Gentleman, R. R: a language for data analysis and graphics J. Comput. Graph. Stat. 1996; 5 :299-314 Crossref Scopus (8914) Google Scholar ; Paradis et al., 2004 48. Paradis, E. ∙ Claude, J. ∙ Strimmer, K. APE: analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution in R language Bioinformatics. 2004; 20 :289-290 Crossref Scopus (9113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schliep, 2011 57. Schliep, K.P. phangorn: phylogenetic analysis in R Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :592-593 Crossref Scopus (2287) PubMed Google Scholar ) and visualized it using the command version of iTOL v4 ( Letunic and Bork, 2019 34. Letunic, I. ∙ Bork, P. Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v4: recent updates and new developments Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W256-W259 Crossref Scopus (4080) PubMed Google Scholar ). After manually inspecting all 28,822 ML trees, we identified 1,410 putative HGT-acquired genes. We compared the number of HGT-acquired genes between 165 genomes annotated by NCBI pipeline and 53 genomes annotated by the authors of the original studies and found that the number of HGT-acquired genes did not differ significantly between the two types of genome annotations (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; P -value = 0.16).
To evaluate the reliability of 1,410 putative HGT-acquired genes, we carried out three separate analyses: PCR assays, comparison of our putative HGT-acquired genes with previously published genes, and gene expression assays of HGT-acquired genes.
We randomly sampled 54 genes acquired by 16 different insects, representing 8 / 11 orders in this study. For each gene, we first used two separate PCR reactions to amplify upstream and downstream regions that flanked the foreign gene. Each PCR target size was ∼ 1,500 bp. We used agarose gel electrophoretic analysis to judge whether PCR products were expected or not. If the PCR product matched our expected size, we then sequenced the PCR product using Sanger sequence technology. Here, we considered that the HGT-acquired gene was successfully validated if its upstream and downstream regions were successfully amplified and their Sanger sequences were nearly identical (identity of ≥ 98%) to DNA sequences in our contigs or scaffolds.
To collect the greatest possible set of previously published HGT-acquired genes as of 20 June 2021, we used “insect and HGT” and “insect and horizontal gene transfer” as search terms in NCBI’s PubMed Browser ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). As a results, 68 studies were found. For each study, we manually checked whether the insects mentioned in the published study were also included in the list of our 218 insects. This filter resulted in the analysis of 193 HGT-acquired genes from 14 previously published studies.
To retrieve the transcriptome data for 218 insects, we used each species name as search term in NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA) Browser ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra ) to get RNA-seq SRA accession numbers. As a result, 90 transcriptome datasets for 32 insects representing 6 / 11 orders were downloaded. The detailed information of stage and tissue for the transcriptome data for each species is given in Table S3 . For each of 699 genes acquired by 32 insects via HGT, we calculated its gene expression by the reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) using featureCounts v1.6.0 ( Liao et al., 2014 35. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (13451) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that at least 478 / 699 (68%) HGT-acquired genes had expression values ≥ 5 RPKM. Average expression of each of 32 insects varies between 11 and 4,082 RPKM. Compared to the average expression level of native genes (608 RPKM), the average expression level of HGT-acquired genes was moderately lower (350 RPKM), which is consistent with the observations in phytoplankton genomes ( Fan et al., 2020 21. Fan, X. ∙ Qiu, H. ∙ Han, W. ... Phytoplankton pangenome reveals extensive prokaryotic horizontal gene transfer of diverse functions Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 :eaba0111 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) and fungal genomes ( Shen et al., 2018 58. Shen, X.-X. ∙ Opulente, D.A. ∙ Kominek, J. ... Tempo and mode of genome evolution in the budding yeast subphylum Cell. 2018; 175 :1533-1545.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ).
From 1,410 HGT-acquired genes, 849 gained 1,534 introns ≥ 100 bp in length. To identify the origin of each of 1,534 introns, we first carried out a BLASTN search against a custom database consisting of the Nucleotide (nt) database at the NCBI as of 20 April 2022 and 218 insect genomes (note that DNA sequences of HGT-acquired genes were masked in insect genomes to avoid self-hits), with an e-value cutoff of 1e-5 and the option “-task blastn-short”. We next parsed all hits for each intron and determined the putative origin of the intron.
To characterize the features of DNA sequences in introns, we first used the Extensive de novo TE Annotator (EDTA v1.9.4) to annotate the whole genome for each of 218 insects with the default settings ( Ou et al., 2019 45. Ou, S. ∙ Su, W. ∙ Liao, Y. ... Benchmarking transposable element annotation methods for creation of a streamlined, comprehensive pipeline Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :275 Crossref Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, we retrieved the features of introns according to their positions in genome.
Two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to the P. xylostella gene LOC105383139 via the CRISPdirect online tool ( http://crispr.dbcls.jp ) based on the N 20 NGG rule. After searching against the P. xylostella genome, we selected two sgRNAs with the lowest probability of off-target effects: sgRNA1: 5’-GGAGGTGAGTTTGCCGGCGGTGG-3’ and sgRNA2: 5’-GGCGACCACGTCTACTTCTCCGG-3’. Note that 3’ end TGG for sgRNA1 and 3’ end CGG for sgRNA2 are the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. DNA templates used for in vitro sgRNA synthesis were amplified with forward primers (Px139-sg1-F: 5’ TAATACGACTCACTATAGGAGGTGAGTTTGCCGGCGGGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGCTAGTCC-3’; Px139-sg2-F: 5’-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCGACCACGTCTACTTCTCGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGCTAGTCC-3’) and the common reverse primer (sgRNA-R: 5’-AAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTCAAGTTGATAACGGACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAA-3’), respectively. PCR products were purified using TaKaRa MiniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa) and then transcribed using T7 High Yield RNA Transcription Kit (Vazyme) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For preparing injection solution, a mixture of sgRNA1 (500 ng/μl), sgRNA2 (500 ng/μl) and Cas9 protein (500 ng/μl, GenCrispr NLS-cas9-NLS nuclease, GenScript) was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to form a stable sgRNAs/Cas9 complex. Given concentrations are at final volume of the injection solution.
Fresh eggs collected within 1 h post oviposition were injected with the sgRNAs/Cas9 solution using a FemtoJet 4i and an InjectMan 4 microinjection system (Eppendorf). The injected eggs were immediately returned to normal rearing conditions and were allowed to develop to adult as the initial generation (G0). Then, a serial crossing scheme was designed to establish a stable homozygous mutant strain of LOC105383139 gene. Briefly, the virgin G0 adults were mated with virgin wild-type (WT) adults in single pairs to produce the G1 progeny. After that, the genomic DNA was extracted from G0 individuals using the FastPure Cell/Tissue DNA Isolation Mini Kit (Vazyme). PCR was performed to amplify the region containing the sgRNA target sites with the genomic DNA from a plucked leg in adult moth, and the generated PCR products were sequenced to examine the mutation. After genotyping, we focused on G1 progeny derived from mutated G0. Retained G1 siblings were crossed in single pairs to generate G2 progeny. Then, single-pair crosses between G2 siblings were performed and kept only G3 progeny from homozygous mutant G2 parents by PCR-based genotyping to establish the LOC105383139 knockout strain (MT-139).
For the egg-laying assay, four different treatments of P. xylostella were set up: 15 pairs of emerged WT female and male adults (WT mated group), 15 pairs of emerged MT-139 female and male adults (MT-139 mated group), 15 emerged WT female adults (WT virgin group), and 15 emerged MT-139 female adults (MT-139 virgin group). Each pair or single female was separately kept in a plastic box. 24 hours later, the P. xylostella females were moved to a new box with a parafilm sheet containing the cabbage leaf extract for egg laying. The P. xylostella females were allowed to lay eggs for 48 hours, and the number of eggs was recorded individually. 10% honey solution was provided for nutrition.
To investigate the development of the eggs laid by the above different groups of P. xylostella females, the percent of eggs terminated at four stages were carefully monitored. The four stages are: 0-10 h (Stage I, no gastrulation), 30 h (Stage II, eye spot is visible), 60 h (Stage III, head capsule is visible), and 70 h (Stage IV, hatching). The morphological characteristics of the developing P. xylostella eggs were photographed by digital microscope SZX2-ILLT (OLYMPUS).
We conducted four treatments: wild-type males (WT♂) + wild-type females (WT♀), wild-type males (WT♂) + knockout females (MT-139♀), knockout males (MT-139♂) + knockout females (MT-139♀), and knockout males (MT-139♂) + wild-type females (WT♀). Each treatment had three replicates using 24 pairs of male and female moths. We sampled adults that were one day old after emergence because by this stage males are mature and frequently court females. For each individual pair no-choice assay, one 1-day-old male adult and one 1-day-old female adult were loaded into round chambers (diameter: 1.6 cm; height: 1.6 cm). The behavioral assays were performed at 25 ± 1 °C and 65 ± 5% relative humidity under the full spectrum LED light (400 lux); the assays started at 10am of 4 January 2022 and were recorded by digital video camera (FDR-AX700, SONY) for 48 consecutive hours of constant light. For a given time period, courtship index is the percentage of successfully courted pairs, in which the male moves toward the female with flapping wings and tipping the abdomen ( Xu et al., 2020 70. Xu, J. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Yang, D. ... Regulation of olfactory-based sex behaviors in the silkworm by genes in the sex-determination cascade PLoS Genet. 2020; 16 :e1008622 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mating index is the percentage of successfully mated pairs in which the male copulates with the female for approximately one hour ( Song et al., 2014 60. Song, W. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Li, P. ... Analysis of the mating and reproductive traits of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) J. Insect Sci. 2014; 14 :267 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ).
P. xylostella from different stages of development were sampled, including egg, L1 (day 1-2 larvae), L2 (day 3 larvae), L3 (day 4 larvae), L4E (day 5 larvae), L4L-M (day 7 male larvae), L4L-F (day 7 female larvae), PE-M (day 1-2 male pupae; early pupal stage), PE-F (day 1-2 female pupae; early pupal stage), PL-M (day 4-5 male pupae; late pupal stage), PL-F (day 4-5 female pupae; late pupal stage), A-M (day 1-2 male adults) and A-F (day 1-2 female adults). In addition to 13 different stages, we also sampled five different tissues (antennae, head, thorax, abdomen, and reproductive system) in 1-day-old male adults. Total RNA was extracted using the FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme) and then reverse transcribed into cDNA using HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR was performed in the AriaMx real-time PCR system (Agilent Technologies) with the ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix Kit (Vazyme). Reactions were carried out for 30s at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of three-step PCR for 10s at 95 °C, 20 s at 55°C, and 20s at 72°C. The RNA levels of the target gene LOC105383139 were normalized to that of tubulin mRNA, and the relative concentration was determined using the 2 −ΔΔCt method.
P. xylostella total RNA was isolated from the whole body from 1-day-old MT-139 male adult, MT-139 female adult, WT male adult, and WT female adult using FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme), and the residual DNA was removed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each treatment had three replicates using 10 moths. For RNA-seq data, library construction and sequencing were performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 (pair ends).
Raw RNA-seq reads were removed of low-quality reads and adapter sequences using Trimmomatic v0.39 ( Bolger et al., 2014 6. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (38365) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. Clean reads were mapped to the reference P. xylostella genome using STAR v2.7.6a ( Dobin et al., 2013 18. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27081) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reads numbers mapped to each gene was counted by featureCounts v1.6.0 ( Liao et al., 2014 35. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (13451) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the resulting transcript count tables were subjected using R packages edgeR v3.360 ( Robinson et al., 2010 54. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26732) PubMed Google Scholar ) and limma v3.50.0 ( Ritchie et al., 2015 53. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21729) PubMed Google Scholar ) for differential expression analysis. Transcripts with an adjusted P value of ≤ 0.05 and log 2 fold change of ≥1 or ≤ -1 were determined as differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially under- or over-expressed genes was conducted using Metascape v3.5 ( https://metascape.org/ ) ( Zhou et al., 2019 72. Zhou, Y. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Pache, L. ... Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1523 Crossref Scopus (7477) PubMed Google Scholar ) in knockout male vs wild-type male and knockout female vs wild-type female, respectively.
To investigate the role of the gene LOC105383139 in butterflies, two closely related Heliconius butterflies ( H. melpomene and H. cydno ) were examined ( Merrill et al., 2019 39. Merrill, R.M. ∙ Rastas, P. ∙ Martin, S.H. ... Genetic dissection of assortative mating behavior PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e2005902 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rossi et al., 2020 56. Rossi, M. ∙ Hausmann, A.E. ∙ Thurman, T.J. ... Visual mate preference evolution during butterfly speciation is linked to neural processing genes Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4763 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, we counted the number of male courting episodes toward females in five trials (each trial lasted 15 minutes) for H. melpomene and H. cydno , respectively. The publicly available courtship data were retrieved from Merrill et al. ( Merrill et al., 2019 39. Merrill, R.M. ∙ Rastas, P. ∙ Martin, S.H. ... Genetic dissection of assortative mating behavior PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e2005902 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, we calculated the expression level of the homolog of the gene LOC105383139 in H. melpomene and H. cydno males using the publicly available transcriptomic data ( Rossi et al., 2020 56. Rossi, M. ∙ Hausmann, A.E. ∙ Thurman, T.J. ... Visual mate preference evolution during butterfly speciation is linked to neural processing genes Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :4763 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were mapped to the H. melpomene and H. cydno genomes in Lepbase ( http://lepbase.org/ ) ( Challis et al., 2016 11. Challis, R.J. ∙ Kumar, S. ∙ Dasmahapatra, K.K. ... Lepbase: the Lepidopteran genome database Preprint at bioRxiv. 2016; Crossref Google Scholar ), respectively. These publicly available transcriptomic data were generated in 2019 from the tissues (eye and brain) from 10-day-old male adults. By this stage males are mature and frequently court females.
We used the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO), version 5.2.2 ( Manni et al., 2021 36. Manni, M. ∙ Berkeley, M.R. ∙ Seppey, M. ... BUSCO update: novel and streamlined workflows along with broader and deeper phylogenetic coverage for scoring of eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral genomes Mol. Biol. Evol. 2021; 38 :4647-4654 Crossref Scopus (1681) PubMed Google Scholar ) to assess the quality of each of the 218 insect genome assemblies. Each assembly’s completeness was assessed based on the presence / absence of a set of 1,367 predefined orthologs that are single-copy in at least 90% of the 75 reference insect genomes in OrthoDB v10 ( Kriventseva et al., 2019 32. Kriventseva, E.V. ∙ Kuznetsov, D. ∙ Tegenfeldt, F. ... OrthoDB v10: sampling the diversity of animal, plant, fungal, protist, bacterial and viral genomes for evolutionary and functional annotations of orthologs Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D807-D811 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ; Waterhouse et al., 2013 64. Waterhouse, R.M. ∙ Tegenfeldt, F. ∙ Li, J. ... OrthoDB: a hierarchical catalog of animal, fungal and bacterial orthologs Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D358-D365 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ).

We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in R v. 3.6.3 ( R Core Team, 2021 51. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2021 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ) to test whether the sets of values in two groups (knockout vs wild-type) are significantly different (NS, P > 0.05; ∗ , P < 0.05; ∗∗ , P < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , P < 0.001). Data are shown as the mean ± SD. Further details of number of samples and replicates are provided in STAR Methods .
