Title: Single Residue Variation in Skeletal Muscle Myosin Enables Direct and Selective Drug Targeting for Spasticity and Muscle Stiffness


Abstract: Summary

Muscle spasticity after nervous system injuries and painful low back spasm affect more than 10% of global population. Current medications are of limited efficacy and cause neurological and cardiovascular side effects because they target upstream regulators of muscle contraction. Direct myosin inhibition could provide optimal muscle relaxation; however, targeting skeletal myosin is particularly challenging because of its similarity to the cardiac isoform. We identified a key residue difference between these myosin isoforms, located in the communication center of the functional regions, which allowed us to design a selective inhibitor, MPH-220. Mutagenic analysis and the atomic structure of MPH-220-bound skeletal muscle myosin confirmed the mechanism of specificity. Targeting skeletal muscle myosin by MPH-220 enabled muscle relaxation, in human and model systems, without cardiovascular side effects and improved spastic gait disorders after brain injury in a disease model. MPH-220 provides a potential nervous-system-independent option to treat spasticity and muscle stiffness.

Section: Introduction

Spasticity—characterized by involuntary increased tone of skeletal muscles—is a common sensorimotor disorder in patients with brain and spinal cord injuries after stroke, trauma, cerebral palsy, or in multiple sclerosis and several myopathies of different etiologies ( Li, 2017 27. Li, S. Spasticity, motor recovery, and neural plasticity after stroke Front. Neurol. 2017; 8 :120 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Trompetto et al., 2014 65. Trompetto, C. ∙ Marinelli, L. ∙ Mori, L. ... Pathophysiology of spasticity: implications for neurorehabilitation BioMed Res. Int. 2014; 2014 :354906 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spasticity-related physical and mental conditions of patients often permanently disable self-supporting life management and ability to work ( Martin et al., 2014 34. Martin, A. ∙ Abogunrin, S. ∙ Kurth, H. ... Epidemiological, humanistic, and economic burden of illness of lower limb spasticity in adults: a systematic review Neuropsychiatr. Dis.

Quality of life and costs of spasticity treatment in German stroke patients Health Econ. Rev. 2016; 6 :27 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Economic burden for post-stroke patients with spasticity is 4-fold higher than those for patients without spasticity ( Zorowitz et al., 2013 86. Zorowitz, R.D. ∙ Gillard, P.J. ∙ Brainin, M. Poststroke spasticity: sequelae and burden on stroke survivors and caregivers Neurology. 2013; 80 :S45-S52 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which includes direct costs of medications and hospitalization and indirect costs of caregiver assignments and independent daily-life-facilitating instruments.
Spasticity develops as a consequence of complex rearrangements of supraspinal inputs, which transforms the synaptic regulation of motoneurons that drives muscle contraction. The resulting exaggerated stretch reflex is accompanied with disrupted balance in regulation from the premotor cortex and reticular formation of the brainstem, which finally leads to aberrantly increased potentiation of motoneurons and hypercontraction of muscles ( Enslin et al., 2020 14.

Current muscle relaxants in medical practice target the central nervous system (e.g., baclofen [GABA B agonist] and tizanidine [α2 agonist]), the neuromuscular junction (botulinum toxins), or the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells (dantrolene; Figure 1 A). Due to their aspecific mechanism of action, centrally acting muscle relaxants have a wide range of neurological and cardiovascular side effects (drowsiness, dizziness, depression, and low blood pressure; Meleger, 2006 38.

Heart conduction problems in a tetraplegic patient caused by a single therapeutic dosage of Baclofen Spinal Cord. 2008; 46 :317-318 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) and low levels of efficacy ( Orsnes et al., 2000 46. Orsnes, G.B. ∙ Sørensen, P.S. ∙ Larsen, T.K. ... Effect of baclofen on gait in spastic MS patients Acta Neurol. Scand. 2000; 101 :244-248 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), which often necessitate the application of an intrathecal pump surgically implanted inside the body ( Medical Advisory, 2005 37. Medical Advisory, S., Medical Advisory Secretariat Intrathecal baclofen pump for spasticity: an evidence-based analysis Ont. Health Technol. Assess. Ser. 2005; 5 :1-93 Google Scholar ). Systemic treatment with botulinum toxins is impossible due to their lethal effect on respiratory and cardiac functions, and local treatments are painful, costly, and often ineffective ( Careta et al., 2015 8. Careta, M.F. ∙ Delgado, L. ∙ Patriota, R. Report of allergic reaction after application of botulinum toxin Aesthet. Surg. J. 2015; 35 :NP102-NP105 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pavone et al., 2016 47. Pavone, V. ∙ Testa, G. ∙ Restivo, D.A. ... Botulinum toxin treatment for limb spasticity in childhood cerebral palsy Front. Pharmacol. 2016; 7 :29 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dantrolene has been associated with severe hepatotoxicity and genotoxicity ( NIH, 2012 43. NIH Dantrolene LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2012 Google Scholar ); therefore, its clinical use is now restricted to life-threatening malignant hyperthermia. Surgical treatment of severe spasticity is limited to selective dorsal rhizotomy, when the sensory roots that transfer abnormal information from the muscles to the spinal cord are transected. However, the advantage of dorsal rhizotomy over oral medications is only marginal, because the treatment often leads to paralysis, chronic back pain, sensory dysfunction, inflammation, constipation, and cyst formation in the spinal column (cf. NICE interventional guidance 373).
Besides nervous-system-injury-related spasticity, permanent muscle spasms emerge as the leading source of prolonged pain in non-specific low back pain and chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder, fibromyalgia, altogether affecting more than 10% of global population ( Marques et al., 2017 33. Marques, A.P. ∙ Santo, A.S.D.E. ∙ Berssaneti, A.A. ... Prevalence of fibromyalgia: literature review update Rev. Bras. Reumatol. Engl. 2017; 57 :356-363 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vos et al., 2012 74. Vos, T. ∙ Flaxman, A.D. ∙ Naghavi, M. ... Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 Lancet. 2012; 380 :2163-2196 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6292) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although treatments of muscle spasm in these syndromes with systemic muscle relaxants are statistically effective, recommendations for their use in clinics underline precautions due to the reported adverse side effects resulting from non-specific targeting of the nervous system ( Tofferi et al., 2004 63. Tofferi, J.K. ∙ Jackson, J.L. ∙ O’Malley, P.G. Treatment of fibromyalgia with cyclobenzaprine: A meta-analysis Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 51 :9-13 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ; van Tulder et al., 2003 70. van Tulder, M.W. ∙ Touray, T. ∙ Furlan, A.D. ... Muscle relaxants for non-specific low back pain Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2003; CD004252 PubMed Google Scholar ).
These considerations emphasize the unmet medical need for the development of a new-generation anti-spastic drug, which directly targets the effector protein of muscle contraction while avoiding neurological and cardiovascular side effects. Nervous-system-independent inhibition of muscle contraction in spastic patients could also overcome the need for targeting the otherwise disrupted synaptic balance of neuronal regulation.
Selective inhibition of skeletal muscles, however, raises the challenge of developing a small molecule that distinguishes between the structurally and sequentially highly similar myosin-2 isoforms. The ideal candidate inhibits only skeletal muscle fast isoforms (MyHC IIa,b,x/d), because the slow isoform in skeletal muscles (myosin heavy chain [MyHC I]) expressed from the MYH7 gene is identical to β-cardiac myosin, the most abundant motor in the ventricles of the heart ( Coluccio, 2020 9. Coluccio, L.M. Myosins and disease Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2020; 1239 :245-316 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 B and S1 ).

Section: Results

In order to relax muscle fibers, we aimed to arrest the actomyosin force-generation cycle in the actin-detached weak actin-binding state ( Takács et al., 2010 62. Takács, B. ∙ Billington, N. ∙ Gyimesi, M. ... Myosin complexed with ADP and blebbistatin reversibly adopts a conformation resembling the start point of the working stroke Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :6799-6804 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), when myosin heads are decoupled from actin filaments ( Málnási-Csizmadia and Kovács, 2010 31.

Biol. 2018; 10 :a023200 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 C). Using rational pharmacological design in a model MyHC IIa myosin structure, we developed and optimized a small-molecule inhibitor (MPH-220) into the myosin-2 class-specific blebbistatin-binding pocket ( Allingham et al., 2005 1. Allingham, J.S. ∙ Smith, R. ∙ Rayment, I. The structural basis of blebbistatin inhibition and specificity for myosin II Nat. Struct. Mol.

Specificity of blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; 25 :337-341 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Straight et al., 2003 60. Straight, A.F. ∙ Cheung, A. ∙ Limouze, J. ... Dissecting temporal and spatial control of cytokinesis with a myosin II Inhibitor Science. 2003; 299 :1743-1747 Crossref Scopus (1167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 D and S2 ). MPH-220 enabled selective inhibition of fast skeletal myosin-2 isoforms (further referred to as skeletal myosins; Figure S1 ) isolated from rabbit psoas muscle, whereas—even at extremely high concentrations—it did not inhibit the ATPase activity of slow skeletal/β-cardiac myosin (further referred to as cardiac myosin) isolated from left ventricle of porcine heart or smooth muscle myosin-2 ( Figure 1 E; Table S1 ) or any non-muscle myosin-2 (NM2) isoforms ( Figure 1 F; Table S1 ). Sequence analysis of the inhibitor binding site revealed an important difference between the cardiac and skeletal myosins near the morpholine ring of MPH-220 at a location playing a key role in the myosin force-generation pathway ( Málnási-Csizmadia and Kovács, 2010 31. Málnási-Csizmadia, A. ∙ Kovács, M. Emerging complex pathways of the actomyosin powerstroke Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35 :684-690 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). The drug-interacting amino acid is uniquely and invariably leucine in fast skeletal myosin heavy chains (Leu 476 in human MyHC IIa), whereas this position is occupied by phenylalanine in all other myosin-2 isoforms ( Figures 1 B and S1 ). We hypothesized that this structural difference can be the basis for the extreme selectivity of MPH-220 toward skeletal myosins. Therefore, we assessed the role of a Phe/Leu exchange through mutational analysis of human non-muscle myosin-2C (NM2C), which is not inhibited by MPH-220 in the wild-type form, possibly due to the presence of Phe 490 in the corresponding position. According to our hypothesis, the expressed NM2C F490L variant became sensitive to MPH-220 ( Figure 1 F), corroborating that the single-amino-acid change determines the observed selectivity.
Considering the selective inhibitory nature of MPH-220 on myosin samples ( Figures 1 E and 1F) and its potential to become a new-generation anti-spastic drug candidate, we performed ATPase inhibition assays on human myosin samples. Expressed human β-cardiac myosin was essentially unaffected by MPH-220, however, the non-selective myosin-2 inhibitor, blebbistatin, completely blocked its ATPase activity ( Figure 1 G; Table S1 ). We further tested MPH-220 on skeletal and cardiac myosin samples isolated from patient-derived biopsies ( Figure 1 H; Table S1 ). In line with their myosin-2 isoform composition, skeletal myosin samples from m.vastus lateralis and m.soleus —containing 56% and 28% fast isoforms in human muscles ( Figure S1 )—were inhibited by 70% and 29%, respectively, confirming the hypothesis that only the fast isoform fraction is targeted by MPH-220. More importantly, β-cardiac myosin isolated from human heart left ventricle was unaffected by MPH-220 ( Figure 1 H; Table S1 ). By contrast, blebbistatin reduced the activity of m.vastus lateralis and cardiac myosin samples by more than 90%, confirming that MPH-220 inhibition is proportional to the ratio of fast myosin isoform in different tissues ( Figure 1 H; Table S1 ). These results provide the basis for future safe systemic administration of MPH-220 to human patients. Left ventricle human biopsy contains cca. 10% α-cardiac myosin isoform (expressed from the MYH6 gene [ Figure S1 ; Miyata et al., 2000 40. Miyata, S. ∙ Minobe, W. ∙ Bristow, M.R. ... Myosin heavy chain isoform expression in the failing and nonfailing human heart Circ. Res. 2000; 86 :386-390 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ], which also contains Phe in the proximal part of HP-helix Phe 474 ). The lack of inhibition of myosin samples from the biopsies confirms that α-cardiac myosin could not be inhibited by MPH-220. We also note that gene products of MYH1, MYH2, and MYH4 encoding fast skeletal muscle myosin heavy chains IIx/d, IIa, and IIb, respectively, are not expressed in adult human heart in significant amount ( England and Loughna, 2013 13. England, J. ∙ Loughna, S. Heavy and light roles: myosin in the morphogenesis of the heart Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70 :1221-1239 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; NCBI Gene Expression database).
In order to further analyze the molecular background of selectivity, we crystalized fast skeletal muscle myosin (isolated from high-quality rabbit m.psoas ) in the presence of MPH-220 ( Figures 2 A and S3 ). The crystal structure confirmed that MPH-220 binds to the blebbistatin-binding cleft and its morpholine ring is in close proximity to Leu 476 . This residue is at the N terminus of the so-called HP-helix of the L50 subdomain ( Cope et al., 1996 10. Cope, M.J. ∙ Whisstock, J. ∙ Rayment, I. ... Conservation within the myosin motor domain: implications for structure and function Structure. 1996; 4 :969-987 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is preceded by the switch-2 loop and followed by the relay region of the motor. Comparison of the MPH-220-bound skeletal and blebbistatin-bound Dictyostelium myosin-2 structures confirms that, although the tricyclic cores of the inhibitors, including the chiral OH, are positioned similarly, Phe 466 of the HP-helix in Dictyostelium myosin-2 comes into steric hindrance with MPH-220 ( Figure 2 B). Likewise, the position of this Phe in cardiac myosin structure also causes steric hindrance with MPH-220 ( Planelles-Herrero et al., 2017 49. Planelles-Herrero, V.J. ∙ Hartman, J.J. ∙ Robert-Paganin, J. ... Mechanistic and structural basis for activation of cardiac myosin force production by omecamtiv mecarbil Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :190 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 C). This steric hindrance based on crystal structures together with the biochemical results strongly support that the unique Leu in the HP-helix of fast skeletal muscle myosin isoforms is responsible for the extreme selectivity of MPH-220. This mechanism for selective inhibition among myosin-2 isoforms is analogous to how blebbistatin is selective for myosin-2s due to the presence of the switch-2 Ser/Ala residue in myosin-2s ( Allingham et al., 2005 1. Allingham, J.S. ∙ Smith, R. ∙ Rayment, I. The structural basis of blebbistatin inhibition and specificity for myosin II Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12 :378-379 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas this position is occupied by Tyr/Phe in myosins from other classes that are uninhibited by blebbistatin. The resolved crystal structure also confirmed that MPH-220 selects and stabilizes the pre-powerstroke state. Overall, the structure validated the in silico approach to design molecules for selective inhibitor development ( Figure S3 ).
We further studied the effect of MPH-220 on muscle force generation in living animals ( Figure 3 A). In agreement with the ATPase inhibitory properties, the S(−) enantiomer of MPH-220 was drastically more effective than the R(+) enantiomer when animals were treated orally with MPH-220 ( Figure S4 ). Consequently, the force-relaxing effect of the racemic mixture was significantly lower than that of the S(−) enantiomer. Although the racemic mixture caused maximum 40% reduction, the S(−) enantiomer could decrease hindleg force by 70% in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figures 3 B and 3C). The 30% residual isometric force level for S(−)-MPH-220 is in line with the presence of uninhibitable slow skeletal muscle isoforms in rat hindleg muscles. This attribute is of high importance because, unlike centrally acting muscle relaxants, MPH-220 would never cause overdose-related patient immobilization due to the remaining slow myosin-mediated muscle tone. Importantly, the decreased force persisted for more than 10 h ( Figure 3 C), which indicates optimal properties for pharmacological development. The force-relaxing effect after oral administration was only marginally slower than that after intraperitoneal injection ( Figure S4 ), which indicated optimal absorption properties of MPH-220. High endothelial permeability was further confirmed by Caco-2 assay, which showed that MPH-220 is highly permeable with significantly faster transfer rate in the absorptive direction over the excretive direction ( Figure S4 ).
Although skeletal muscle relaxation could be efficiently achieved by MPH-220, cardiac function was not perturbed in the concentration range that was effective in skeletal muscle force relaxation experiments ( Figures 3 F and S4 ). More importantly, neither cardiac nor respiratory functions differed significantly from the excipient control during the 10-h experiments, suggesting a reasonable safety range between the effective and toxic doses of MPH-220 ( Figures 3 E and 3F). The maximum 25% decrease in heart rate and blood flow parameters is most probably due to the 10-h-long anesthesia without food and drink after an overnight starvation period and not the effect of myosin inhibition ( Figure S4 ). Moreover, the identical direction of the change in heart rate and blood flow parameters solely reflects slowing down the heart during anesthesia, because cardiac myosin inhibition preceding heart failure increases heart rate while drastically lowering blood flow, as shown with the non-selective inhibitor, AmBleb ( Figure S4 ).
We also examined MPH-220 distribution in rat tissues in a time-dependent manner and observed a dose-dependent, few-fold accumulation of MPH-220 in skeletal muscle samples over other tissues, including brain, heart, kidney, and blood ( Figures 3 G–3I). Accumulation in skeletal muscle persists after 3 h when MPH-220 is completely eliminated from blood and other tissues, whereas its concentration in target muscles is still in the effective concentration range (10-fold higher than the determined inhibitory constant [IC 50 ]). MPH-220 concentration was only temporarily elevated in the liver, which metabolizes MPH-220. We note that MPH-220 concentration in the diaphragm was much lower compared to other striated muscle samples, which explains the lack of respiratory dysfunctions after MPH-220 treatments. This feature is expected to prove even more favorable in human patients due to the substantially higher ratio of MyHC I slow isoforms in human diaphragm ( Figure S1 ). The pronounced accumulation of MPH-220 in skeletal muscles might be the result of high concentration of fast skeletal myosin isoforms, which bind the inhibitor with high affinity. This hypothesis is supported by the significantly lower accumulation of the R(+) enantiomer, which further explains the 4-fold weaker force relaxation by the R(+) enantiomer (cf. Figure S4 A ). The species-specific MyHC distribution ( Figure S1 ) also emphasizes the need for testing these pharmacodynamic properties of MPH-220 in larger animals (dogs and mini pigs), which—unlike rodents—have higher slow isoform proportions, more similar to human tissues.
Direct and efficient targeting of skeletal muscle contraction by MPH-220 raises the possibility of the development of a new-generation, nervous-system-independent, anti-spastic drug. Therefore, we investigated the efficiency of MPH-220 to improve spasticity-related gait disorders in rats with brain injury. We applied the recently developed spastic cerebral palsy animal model to provoke paralysis-coupled spasticity in rats ( Figure 4 A; Yu et al., 2013 84. Yu, Y. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Shao, X. ... Establishing a rat model of spastic cerebral palsy by targeted ethanol injection Neural Regen. Res. 2013; 8 :3255-3262 PubMed Google Scholar ), and gait disorders were analyzed by non-invasive methods focusing on the motoric functions of rats combined with neural-network-based deep-learning movement analysis ( Figure 4 B; Video S1 ). Similarly to human patients with stroke or brain trauma, rats showed individually variable gait patterns with different degrees of palsy in the lower limbs. Thus, we analyzed the effect of MPH-220 treatment individually on each animal and focused on treatment-induced changes in spasticity-related gait components.

Rat-A could not use the right forelimb and the left hindleg due to paralysis-coupled spasticity, which resulted in an almost complete one-sided circling behavior in the open-field box 2 days after the surgery ( Video S2 ). 40 min after MPH-220 treatment, the ratio of left turns increased from 15% to 38%, which further improved to 51% 3 h after the treatment ( Figure 4 C). Even though rat-A walked significantly less after treatment, it was obvious that a major improvement was achieved: after relaxing spasticity in its left hindleg, rat-A was able to use this leg and make quasi-normal steps ( Video S3 ). Rat-B and C also had paralysis-coupled spasticity in the hindlegs, although to a lower degree than rat-A. The most obvious spasticity-related feature in the open-field test was the random falling and the spontaneous cramping of the right hindleg of rat-C ( Video S4 ). Importantly, the relative frequency of both symptoms decreased drastically after MPH-220 treatment ( Figure 4 D). Besides these serious gait abnormalities, rat-B and C could not stand up in the cylinder assay before MPH-220 treatment. In agreement with the kinetics observed in the open-field assay, 3 and 5 h after oral MPH-220 treatment, both rats could stand up in the cylinder, touching the wall with both forepaws with the same number of events as their healthy littermates ( Figure 4 D). Next morning, the positive effects on falling and cramping frequencies and on the ability to stand up in the cylinder disappeared as MPH-220 was excreted from their bodies. Rat-D showed spastic gait disorders only in the right hindleg without signs of severe palsy, and all other legs remained unaffected. This animal could not use the right hindleg normally due to stiff muscles, which resulted in abnormal positioning of all four paws ( Figures 4 E and S5 ). The spastic leg was offset from the body axis, which hindered normal progression of the limb during walking and resulted in lopsided gait patterns with tilted body axis ( Figures 4 F and S5 ; Video S5 ). After MPH-220 treatment, the gait of this animal improved significantly as it started to use both hindlegs normally. The improved movement was the consequence of relaxed spasticity in the hindlegs, which enabled the animal to pull its leg into the body axis, thereby making normal walking steps ( Figures 4 E, 4F, and S5 ; Video S5 ). The enhanced gait functions remained persistent for 5 h, when paw positions and body symmetry were close to those of the healthy animals. Similarly to the other experiments, the effect relapsed to the pretreatment state after 21 h. These effects could be reproduced 5 and 12 days after the first treatment, corroborating the specific anti-spastic effect of MPH-220 treatment.

Beside the individual patterns of spastic behavior that could be improved by MPH-220 treatment, deep-learning analysis was used to assess the over-ground locomotion of all animals during 15 min of free movement in the open-field test. We used 28 parameters characterizing the 3D position of the limbs and body axis in three movement-speed regimes ( Figure S5 ) to quantify the locomotor features based on pose-estimating deep-learning algorithms and exposed these to a principal-components analysis (PCA). In the global PCA space—including all three speed regimes—the major gait component (PC1) was significantly different from the healthy range, indicating that pyramidal tract damage-induced spastic walk asymmetry is reflected in the major principal gait component ( Figure 5 A). Most importantly, MPH-220 treatment significantly decreased PC1 scores, the effect of which was maximal at 3 h and no longer detected after 21 h. Importantly, PC1 scores were significantly different from the untreated level, however, the treated values did not differ significantly from the healthy range, which confirms that MPH-220 ameliorated gait pattern of the treated animals to that of the healthy rats. However, when we analyzed the three speed regimes separately, we found that pyramid tract damage mostly affected PC1 in the slow and medium-speed regimes, whereas PC2 and PC3 were significantly affected in the fast regime ( Figures 5 B and S5 ). More importantly, PC1 could be significantly improved by MPH-220 treatment in the slow- and medium-speed regimes, and PC3 was significantly improved in the fast regime. We identified the major parameters that predominantly contributed to PC1 and PC3 in the slow, medium, and fast regimes and found a marked difference in the parameter sets defining PC1 and PC3 ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S5 ). Analysis of these components revealed that, in the slow- and medium-speed regimes, MPH-220 treatment has the largest effect on the volumes of the ellipsoids representing paw positions and on the distances between their centers, both suggesting a much-ordered stepping pattern and straightened body axis ( Figure 5 E). On the other hand, in the fast regime, MPH-220 has the most pronounced effect on the angles of the ellipsoids, which indicates that the treated rats could keep their legs closer to the body axis similarly to the healthy running pattern. These results further solidify that MPH-220 is capable of treating the spastic component of movement abnormalities after brain injury, exhibiting a promising potential to address the unmet medical need for effective anti-spastic therapies.

Section: Discussion

Our biochemical and in vivo results demonstrate that MPH-220 selectively inhibits fast skeletal myosin-2 isoforms, which enables effective improvements of spastic gait disorders after brain damage as a consequence of efficient reduction of muscle force. These findings emphasize that nervous-system-injury-derived muscle spasticity can be treated by directly targeting the effector protein of muscle contraction, thereby avoiding adverse neurological and cardiovascular side effects that are characteristic of currently used muscle relaxants. Moreover, as MPH-220 proved a promising candidate for further anti-spastic drug development, we tested its pharmacological properties by investigating its off-target effects on human enzymes, including kinase panels and G-protein-coupled and nuclear hormone receptors ( Figure S6 ). We also demonstrate that MPH-220 is not mutagenic and not cytotoxic ( Figure S6 ), which, together with its high-absorption properties, confirms that MPH-220 is safe and possesses optimal attributes for further drug development as a new-generation anti-spastic drug candidate.
Although we acknowledge that MPH-220 may cause general muscle weakness as observed in our animal disease model, we believe that this effect will be significantly less pronounced in human patients due to the higher ratio of MyHC I slow skeletal muscle myosin isoform. In human skeletal muscles, the presence of 40%–60% MyHC I isoform, which is not inhibited by MPH-220, highlights another important aspect of this type of muscle relaxation as opposed to nervous-system-targeting medications. Although general weakness of aspecific muscle groups may appear by using both types of muscle relaxants, the MPH-220-based anti-spastic effect is not expected to cause complete immobilization of patients due to the residual muscle tone from the uninhibited slow isoform fraction. Another concern may arise regarding extraocular muscles, which express MYH13 gene product containing Leu required for MPH-220 inhibition ( Figure S1 ). Nevertheless, in adult human extraocular muscles, significant amount of α-cardiac myosin heavy chain is expressed ( Kjellgren et al., 2003 22. Kjellgren, D. ∙ Thornell, L.E. ∙ Andersen, J. ... Myosin heavy chain isoforms in human extraocular muscles Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44 :1419-1425 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ); therefore, these muscles will also not be completely immobilized by MPH-220. However, these effects might be investigated during future clinical trials. Moreover, based on the complex pathophysiology of spasticity development ( Trompetto et al., 2014 65. Trompetto, C. ∙ Marinelli, L. ∙ Mori, L. ... Pathophysiology of spasticity: implications for neurorehabilitation BioMed Res. Int. 2014; 2014 :354906 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ), we suppose that early treatment with an effective anti-spastic drug will significantly delay the onset and markedly reduce the severity of spastic symptoms after nervous system injuries.
Besides traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries in stroke and cerebral palsy, spasticity is also a common symptom in several other diseases of broad etiology ( Table 1 ). Spasticity is a major component of upper motor neuron lesion syndromes, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spastic paraplegia, multiple system atrophy, and atypical Parkinsonism, and also a characteristic symptom in several skeletal muscle myopathies, such as myotonia congenita, myotonia fluctuans, or certain neurodegenerative diseases. Altogether, spasticity in these syndromes affect nearly 1% of the human population (cca. 55 million spastic patients), and more than 10% of people suffer from often-painful muscle stiffness in low back pain and fibromyalgia ( Marques et al., 2017 33. Marques, A.P. ∙ Santo, A.S.D.E. ∙ Berssaneti, A.A. ... Prevalence of fibromyalgia: literature review update Rev. Bras. Reumatol.

Consequently, a nervous-system-independent, safe, and effective treatment is a significant unmet need from both clinical and socio-economical perspectives. Therefore, MPH-220 is a promising anti-spastic drug candidate to improve quality of life and may contribute to extended life expectancy ( Blair et al., 2019 5.

Rabbit actin was prepared as described previously from rabbit muscle acetone powder (Pel-Freez Biologicals Llc., AR, USA) ( Spudich and Watt, 1971 59. Spudich, J.A. ∙ Watt, S. The regulation of rabbit skeletal muscle contraction. I. Biochemical studies of the interaction of the tropomyosin-troponin complex with actin and the proteolytic fragments of myosin J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246 :4866-4871 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 5-6 g muscle acetone powder was soaked into ice cold G-actin Buffer (20 ml/g powder; 2 mM Tris pH 7.7, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 2 mM DTT) and was stirred on ice for 40 min. After stirring wet acetone powder was filtered using filter paper. 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl were added to the filtered solution and further incubated at room temperature for 30 min. KCl was added to the final concentration 0.5 M and was stirred for further 60 min. Solution was centrifuged (40,000 rpm, 90 min, 4°C) and pellet was homogenized in G-buffer and excessively dialyzed against G-buffer. After dialysis, solution was centrifuged (40,000 rpm, 90 min, 4°C) and the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen in 1 mL aliquots. Skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1 (S1) was prepared from rabbit m.psoas according to an earlier published protocol ( Margossian and Lowey, 1982 32. Margossian, S.S. ∙ Lowey, S. Preparation of myosin and its subfragments from rabbit skeletal muscle Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85 :55-71 Crossref Scopus (883) PubMed Google Scholar ) by α-chymotryptic digestion (0.25 mg/ml α-chymotrypsin, 10 min, 25°C; reaction was stopped with 3 mM PMSF). Psoas S1 prep was further purified on MonoS 5/50 GL column to produce high-quality prep for crystallization. Cardiac muscle myosin S1 was isolated from left ventricle of porcine heart following cardiac myofibril preparation protocol ( Tong et al., 2008 64. Tong, C.W. ∙ Stelzer, J.E. ∙ Greaser, M.L. ... Acceleration of crossbridge kinetics by protein kinase A phosphorylation of cardiac myosin binding protein C modulates cardiac function Circ. Res. 2008; 103 :974-982 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) by α-chymotryptic digestion (0.05 mg/ml α-chymotrypsin, 10 min, 25°C; reaction was stopped with 3 mM PMSF). Human cardiac muscle myosin subfragment-1 (S1) was prepared from adult human left ventricular tissue samples obtained from ethically consented donors (AnaBios Corporation) according to earlier published protocol ( Margossian and Lowey, 1982 32. Margossian, S.S. ∙ Lowey, S. Preparation of myosin and its subfragments from rabbit skeletal muscle Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85 :55-71 Crossref Scopus (883) PubMed Google Scholar ) by α-chymotryptic digestion (0.25 mg/ml α-chymotrypsin, 9 min, 25°C; reaction was stopped with 3 mM PMSF). Smooth muscle myosin S1 was prepared from chicken gizzard ( Trybus, 2000 66. Trybus, K.M. Biochemical studies of myosin Methods. 2000; 22 :327-335 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) by activated papain digestion ( Seidel, 1980 55. Seidel, J.C. Fragmentation of gizzard myosin by alpha-chymotrypsin and papain, the effects on ATPase activity, and the interaction with actin J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255 :4355-4361 Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) (0.2 mg/ml papain, 12 min, 25°C; reaction was stopped with 5 mM sodium iodoacetate). Human skeletal muscle myosin was prepared similarly to rabbit skeletal muscle myosin ( Margossian and Lowey, 1982 32. Margossian, S.S. ∙ Lowey, S. Preparation of myosin and its subfragments from rabbit skeletal muscle Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85 :55-71 Crossref Scopus (883) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, biopsies were washed in Rigor Buffer (20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 40 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 ) and myosin was extracted in Myosin Extraction Buffer (20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 500 mM KCl). Extracted myosin was precipitated in 21-volume ultrapure water with 1 mM EDTA. Myosin was collected in tabletop centrifuge, dissolved in Myosin Extraction Buffer and kept on ice until the measurement. The Sf9 codon optimized sequences for NM2 motor domains (Met 1 -Arg 775 for NM2A, Met 1 -Arg 782 for NM2B (B0) and Met 1 -Arg 799 for NM2C (C0)) fused to an Ala-Ser linker and an artificial α-actinin lever arm: (amino acid sequence: AS -EQTKSDYLKRANELVQWINDKQASLESRDFGDSIE-SVQSFMNAHKEYKKTEKPPKGQEVSELEAIYNSLQTKLRLIKREPFVAPAGLTPNEIDST-WSALEKAEQEHAEALRIELKRQKKIAVLLQKYNRILKKLENWATTKSVYLGSNETGDSI-TAVQAKLKNLEAFDGECQSLEGQSNSDLLSILAQLTELNYNGVPELTERKDTFFAQQW-TGVKSSAETYKNTLLAELERLQKIED) as described earlier for NM2C ( Heissler and Manstein, 2011 19. Heissler, S.M. ∙ Manstein, D.J. Comparative kinetic and functional characterization of the motor domains of human nonmuscle myosin-2C isoforms J. Biol.

The NM2C-F490L construct was also synthesized by Biomatik Co in pFastBac1 expression vector. The pFastBac1/NM2 constructs were overexpressed in Sf9 cells after bacmid preparation from DH10Bac cells. To reduce proteolytic digestion during expression, Pepstatin-A (0.1 mg/l) was added to Sf9 cells ( Gotoh et al., 2001 16. Gotoh, T. ∙ Miyazaki, Y. ∙ Sato, W. ... Proteolytic activity and recombinant protein production in virus-infected Sf-9 insect cell cultures supplemented with carboxyl and cysteine protease inhibitors J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2001; 92 :248-255 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expressed human β-cardiac myosin S1 ( Kawana et al., 2017 20. Kawana, M. ∙ Sarkar, S.S. ∙ Sutton, S. ... Biophysical properties of human β-cardiac myosin with converter mutations that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1601959 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) was prepared as earlier described ( Sommese et al., 2013 58. Sommese, R.F. ∙ Sung, J. ∙ Nag, S. ... Molecular consequences of the R453C hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation on human β-cardiac myosin motor function Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :12607-12612 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Steady-state ATPase measurements were carried out in 50 μL volume in a flat bottom 384-well plate (Nunc-Thermo Fischer) using NADH-PK/LDH coupled assay described previously ( Gyimesi et al., 2008 18. Gyimesi, M. ∙ Kintses, B. ∙ Bodor, A. ... The mechanism of the reverse recovery step, phosphate release, and actin activation of Dictyostelium myosin II J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :8153-8163 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, myosin samples were mixed with 2% pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (PK/LDH) mixture (Sigma P0294), 1 mM phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) and 200 μM NADH at 25°C in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP and 25 μM F-actin in ATPase buffer (10 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) for 15 minutes. Absorbance was followed at 340 nm wavelength to follow the decrease of NADH in Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek Epoch). ATPase activity was calculated from linear regression of the time dependent absorbance data collected at 340 nm. Different concentrations of inhibitors were added to the reaction in 0.5 μL DMSO (1% of total volume). DMSO and actin-controls were measured for each measurement set.
Simulations were carried out using the AMBER16 program suite. The ff14SB force field ( Maier et al., 2015 30. Maier, J.A. ∙ Martinez, C. ∙ Kasavajhala, K. ... ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015; 11 :3696-3713 Crossref Scopus (6930) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used in all subsequent simulations to model protein interactions. The initial structure of the Fast Human Skeletal myosin-2 motor domain was modeled using structural homology with the SWISS-MODEL server ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 78. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (7765) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Human Cardiac myosin-2 motor domain (PDB: 5N69 ). ADP.VO 4 was substituted to ADP.PO 4 . Coordinates and partials charges for MPH-220 were refined using antechamber of the AMBERTOOLS package with the AM1 semi-empirical Hamiltonian. Force field parameters for the MPH-220 atoms were adopted from GAFF force field ( Wang et al., 2004 77. Wang, J. ∙ Wolf, R.M. ∙ Caldwell, J.W. ... Development and testing of a general amber force field J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1157-1174 Crossref Scopus (14096) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on structural similarity following the suggestions of the parmchk2 program. We determined the initial position of MPH-220 by RMSD least-square fitting the model’s structure with the blebbistatin- Dyctiostelium motor domain (PDB: 3BZ9 ) binding pocket. The initial position was then determined by RMSD least-square fitting the tricyclic ring of MPH-220 to blebbistatin’s tricyclic ring. The water molecules resolved by crystallography were retained and the model was expanded in an 8-Angstrom clearance dodecahedron box with TIP3P water molecules for explicit solvation and counterions were added to neutralize the system’s net charge. The complex was minimized with 2000 steps steepest descent followed by 4000 steps of conjugate gradient method while applying 10 kcal/(mol Å 2 ) to all atoms except water molecules. The minimization continued with the same protocol while removing the restraint from all H atoms. The same restraints were applied for the following steps. The complex was heated in 3 100-K 20-ps steps to 300 K under NVT conditions, then subsequently equilibrated to 1 bar in 20 ps under NPT conditions. NPT conditions were applied in all further steps. The system was cooled back to 10 K in the next 20 ps. Restraints from this point were only applied to the protein backbone. The system was heated back to 300 K in 10 ps and the simulation was continued for 1ns. The restraint force was then gradually reduced in 1 ns simulations steps to 5, 1, 0.5 and 0 kcal/(mol Å 2 ). The simulation was then allowed to continue and equilibrate under NPT conditions for a further 200 ns to obtain the final structures. The trajectories were sampled every 50 ps during the simulation.
MyCH IIb-MPH-220 crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion using a protein solution at 10 mg/ml containing 10 mM MOPS pH 7.3; 50 mM NaCl; 3 mM MgCl 2 ; 0.2 mM ATP; 3 mM NaN 3 ; 1 mM DTT; 0.1 mM EGTA; 0.1 mM PMSF; 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2mM MgADP, 2mM VO 4 , 0.5 mM MPH-220 against a reservoir containing 35% PEG600, 20mM DTT; 100mM HEPES pH 7.0; 5% DMSO at 291K. Optimization of crystallization conditions was performed with trypsin in situ proteolysis. Crystals were frozen then shot in the Proxima2 beamline (synchrotron Soleil). X-ray diffraction images were processed with AutoProc ( Vonrhein et al., 2011 73. Vonrhein, C. ∙ Flensburg, C. ∙ Keller, P. ... Data processing and analysis with the autoPROC toolbox Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :293-302 Crossref Scopus (1202) PubMed Google Scholar ). The crystal belongs to the P2 1 2 1 2 1 space group with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Figure S3 .
Structure of the motor domain was initially solved by molecular replacement using 1QVI ( Gourinath et al., 2003 17. Gourinath, S. ∙ Himmel, D.M. ∙ Brown, J.H. ...

Vagin, A. ∙ Teplyakov, A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :22-25 Crossref Scopus (3010) PubMed Google Scholar ), and completed with a second search for the lever arm and its essential light chain from 5N69 ( Planelles-Herrero et al., 2017 49. Planelles-Herrero, V.J. ∙ Hartman, J.J. ∙ Robert-Paganin, J. ... Mechanistic and structural basis for activation of cardiac myosin force production by omecamtiv mecarbil Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :190 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Phaser ( McCoy et al., 2007 36. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (16083) PubMed Google Scholar ). Refinement constraints for the ligand were automatically generated with Grade ( Bricogne et al., 2017 7. Bricogne, G. ∙ Blanc, E. ∙ Brandl, M. ... BUSTER version 2.10.3 Global Phasing, 2017 Google Scholar ). The final model was obtained after several cycles of building in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 12. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refinement with the latest 2019 release of BUSTER-TNT ( Bricogne et al., 2017 7. Bricogne, G. ∙ Blanc, E. ∙ Brandl, M. ... BUSTER version 2.10.3 Global Phasing, 2017 Google Scholar ).
Isometric force of rat left hindleg was measured by a force meter (Supertech Ltd.) after the hindleg was fixed and stimulated according to earlier published protocol ( Pratt and Lovering, 2014 51. Pratt, S.J.P. ∙ Lovering, R.M. A stepwise procedure to test contractility and susceptibility to injury for the rodent quadriceps muscle J. Biol. Methods. 2014; 1 :e8 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). A non-elastic wire was attached to the ankle of the rat and pulled until pre-strained position. Spike (R) software controlled stimulator (BioStim, Supertech Ltd.) was used to trigger the n. femoralis through metal electrodes with 100 Hz, 1 s, 4V, 2.5 minute intervals. Data detection was performed with CED Micro 1401 data acquisition interface. Inhibitors were either dissolved in 200 μL DMSO for intraperitoneal injection or in 1ml 30% SBECD solution (dissolved in GIBCO™ Dulbeccos’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (D-PBS)) for oral administration.
Cardiovascular and respiratory functions were measured using a non-invasive pulse oximeter (MouseOx Plus, Starr Life Sciences Corp., PA, USA). Blood flow parameters shown on figures corresponds to the measured pulse distention, which is the measure of change in blood vessel volumes in the light path of the sensor, which reflects local blood pressure changes. Rats were anesthetized and the neck region was trimmed using a small animal trimmer to facilitate accurate measurements by size specific collar sensor.
Animals were treated i.p. or per os with MPH-220, over-anesthetized and tissue samples were collected and frozen at −80°C. Tissue samples were thawed and homogenized in D-PBS, and chloroform was added to the homogenate. Samples were thoroughly shaken, vortexed and sonicated. After sonication, samples were centrifuged and the chloroform layer was collected. Chloroform extraction was repeated two more times. Chloroform was evaporated in a fume-hood. After chloroform drying, water-acetonitrile solution (50%/50%) was added to the samples, which were again vortexed and sonicated again. Samples were centrifuged and supernatants were collected and transferred into ultra-centrifuge vials and ultracentrifuged at 60,000 rpm, 10°C for 60 minutes before HPLC-MS injection. Peak area of compound in HPLC was determined at 400 nm and concentration of compound was determined from the calibration curve. HPLC-MS conditions were the following: Merck Purosphere STAR RP-18 endcapped 250 mm X 4.6 mm column, mobile phase: isocratic 50% H 2 O (0.1% TFA) – 50% ACN (0.09% TFA), injection volume: 20 μL HPLC, flow rate: 0.5 ml/min, run time: 25 min, detection at 260, 280, 300, 400 and 450 nm, capillary voltage: 3.5 kV, cone voltage: 30 V.
Targeted brain damage was performed to establish a rat model of spastic cerebral palsy. Briefly, animals were pre-anesthetized with 4% isoflurane, which was reduced to 2% after the fixation of the animal on the stereotactic apparatus. First, a 2 cm-long longitudinal incision between ears was carried out, which was followed by the cleaning of the surface of the skull by hydrogen peroxide to visualize the Bregma point. Injection coordinates were determined based on The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, 6th Edition ( Paxinos and Watson, 2007 48. Paxinos, G. ∙ Watson, C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates Academic/Elsevier, 2007 Google Scholar ): ML −0.8 mm, AP −10 mm and DV 9.7 mm from the dura. A 25 μl Neuros Syringe (Hamilton, NV, USA) with needle size 22G was used to gently inject 15 μl ethanol for left pyramidal tract lesion. After the injection the syringe was left in place for 10 minutes, followed by its removal from the brain and the sealing of the wound.
The over-ground locomotion of the animals was recorded in an 80 by 80 cm wide plastic open-field box using an 8 mm thick transparent Plexiglas as the bottom panel over the course of 15 minutes. The arena was placed on a custom-made wooden frame in order to raise it 1 m above the ground level, while keeping the transparent bottom unobstructed. A Microsoft Kinect V2 for XBOX ONE (2013) RGB-D sensor was secured approx. 80 cm below the Plexiglas facing upward to capture depth information from inside the open-field arena ( Figure 4 B). The Kinect sensor was connected to a Windows PC (i5-9500F, GeForce GTX 1050 2 GB, 16GB DDR4) placed in a separate room via the official adaptor (Kinect Adaptor for Windows PC) and a USB extension cable. The Kinect for Windows SDK V2.0.1410.19000 API-s were used to control the Kinect sensor in MATLAB v. R2019b with the Image Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for Kinect for Windows Sensor add-on.
An in-house MATLAB program was used to calibrate the spatial position of the device by measuring the relative distance of the four corners of the arena to the sensor to ensure uniform depth information values in the whole arena during experiments. Another in-house MATLAB program was used for image acquisition by the infrared depth camera (512 × 424 / 30 FPS) and the RGB camera (1920 × 1080 / 30 FPS) simultaneously. Video recordings from the depth camera were stored in .mj2 archives using lossless 16-Bit Motion JPEG 2000 compression, while the RGB camera recordings were stored in MP4 formats to allow easy viewer access. The depth video recordings were subjected to a preprocessing MATLAB script to correct the erroneous depth estimates arising from the time-of-flight depth sensing, such as flying pixels and multipath interference. The modified archives were scaled to preserve intensity values of the region of interest (rat in the arena) and exported as 8-Bit uncompressed AVI videos for further use.
A Resnet-50 deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict distinct body parts (nose, neck, center, right forelimb, left forelimb, right hindlimb, left hindlimb, base of the tail) of the animals on the 8-Bit depth recordings using the DeepLabCut toolbox ( Mathis et al., 2018 35. Mathis, A. ∙ Mamidanna, P. ∙ Cury, K.M. ... DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of user-defined body parts with deep learning Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :1281-1289 Crossref Scopus (2046) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the Google Colaboratory python environment. The network training parameters were identical as described in Nath et al. (2019) 42. Nath, T. ∙ Mathis, A. ∙ Chen, A.C. ... Using DeepLabCut for 3D markerless pose estimation across species and behaviors Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :2152-2176 Crossref Scopus (606) PubMed Google Scholar with the provided pre-trained resnet_v1_50 architecture using stochastic gradient descent optimizer, multi-step learning rate (0,005 until 10000 epochs, 0.02 until 430.000, 0.002 until 500.000), batch size of 1, train-test split of 0.3, and no early stopping. We used ∼1000 manually annotated frames for the final training and validation sets (training on 500.000 epochs achieved 1.75 mean pixel error for the training and 7.33 mean pixel error for the validation set). A custom MATLAB script was then used to process the previously modified depth archives (25.000 frames / recording) in conjunction with the error corrected numerical output (X and Y coordinates) of the deep learning algorithm of each labeled body part. The animals were first segmented based on the pixel intensity deviation relative to the background. Each frame was then translated and rotated based on the position and angle of the axis between the center of mass of the animal and the position of its nose to create egocentric recording. This transformation and rotation was then carried out on the body part labels as well. The 3 dimensional position of each limb was calculated by combining the transformed output coordinates of the deep neural net with the depth information of the labeled body parts on each frame of the preprocessed and transformed depth recordings. The three dimensional movement maps were exported to further analyses.
In the final algorithm 95% CI least-squares elliptical fittings were computed on the 3D movement maps of each individual limb of the animals and the gait parameters were calculated (Table S3). Centroid displacement thresholds on moving average function of 100 frames were used to calculate distinct locomotion regimes (1 st Regime: < 0.6 pixel deviation, 2 nd Regime: > 0.6 and < 1.2 pixel deviation, 3 rd Regime: > 1.2 pixel deviation.). The gait parameters were scaled using the Z-score method and subjected to principal component analysis and the results were represented in the 3D PC space together with the 95% CI ellipsoids.
Motor functions of spastic rats were tested in an open-top, 21 cm diameter, clear plastic cylinder. Forelimb activity was calculated from number of touches of each forelimb against the wall of the arena. Forelimb touch was defined when the whole palm touched the sidewall of the cylinder. Number of sidewall touches was counted for 3 minutes.
G-protein coupled receptor inhibition and activation was tested in the gpcrMAX panel of DiscoverX® Profiling service (Eurofins). Caco-2 assays were carried out by Absorption and Permeability Services at Eurofins Discovery. Predictor™ hERG Fluroescence Polarization Assay, SelectScreen Kinase Profiling and SelectScreen Nuclear Receptor Profiling was carried out by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Ames MPF™ (Xenometrix, Switzerland) reverse mutagenicity assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s guide on TA98 and TA100 bacterial strains in the absence and presence of phenobarbital/β-naphtoflavone-induced rat liver S9 fraction. Cytotoxicity measurements were performed with CyQUANT™ LDH Cytotoxicity assay (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocols with human adult dermal (GIBCO, Thermo Fisher) and lung (Cell Applications Inc., CA, USA) fibroblast strains.
Unless otherwise specified, data are presented as means with standard deviations. Principal component analysis data are presented as box and whishkers representation with min to max whiskers in GraphPad Prism software (Graphpad Software Inc.). ATPase activity analysis, IC 50 and maximal inhibition analysis, single exponential fitting and t tests for significance analysis were performed by GraphPad Prism software (Graphpad Software Inc.). Tissue concentration determination was based on standard curve fitting and area under curve analysis by MassLynx software (Waters Ltd.). Principal component analysis was performed by MATLAB software (MathWorks). We did not apply statistical methods to predetermine sample sizes for animal experiments and kept the used subject numbers at a minimum to conform with ARRIVE and 3R principles. Further details of statistical analysis can be found in the figure legends or in the Method Details section.
