Title: Antibody Affinity Shapes the Choice between Memory and Germinal Center B Cell Fates


Abstract: Summary

Immunological memory is required for protection against repeated infections and is the basis of all effective vaccines. Antibodies produced by memory B cells play an essential role in many of these responses. We have combined lineage tracing with antibody cloning from single B cells to examine the role of affinity in B cell selection into germinal centers (GCs) and the memory B cell compartment in mice immunized with an HIV-1 antigen. We find that contemporaneously developing memory and GC B cells differ in their affinity for antigen throughout the immune response. Whereas GC cells and their precursors are enriched in antigen binding, memory B cells are not. Thus, the polyclonal memory B cell compartment is composed of B cells that were activated during the immune response but whose antigen binding affinity failed to support further clonal expansion in the GC.

Section: Introduction

Most effective vaccines elicit memory B cells that produce rapid recall humoral immune responses upon pathogen challenge. However, not all vaccines are equally effective or able to produce lasting neutralizing responses. For example, HIV-1 vaccine development has been particularly vexing, in part, because there is little understanding of how memory B cells expressing broadly neutralizing antibodies are selected or evolve in response to series of related viruses or sequential immunogens ( Escolano et al., 2016 11.

In mice, memory B cell production begins early after the initial immunization when activated precursors rapidly develop into memory cells, enter germinal centers (GCs) or differentiate into plasma cells ( Akkaya et al., 2020 2.

The first wave of memory cells emerges before GC maturation and is composed primarily of immunoglobulin M (IgM)-expressing B cells that have undergone a small number of divisions and carry few if any somatic mutations ( Inamine et al., 2005 17.

Subsequent rounds of memory B cell development occur in GCs after B cells acquire affinity enhancing somatic mutations and undergo class switch recombination ( Suan et al., 2017 42.

Recall immune responses are more rapid than primary responses and produce higher levels of high-affinity antibodies, in part, because long-lived memory cells promptly develop into short-lived antibody-producing plasma cells ( Askonas and Williamson, 1972 3.

In addition, memory B cells can re-enter GCs wherein they undergo further rounds of somatic mutation ( Bende et al., 2007 4. Bende, R.J. ∙ van Maldegem, F. ∙ Triesscheijn, M. ...

Immunol. 2014; 15 :631-637 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, memory B cells represent a small proportion of the cells in secondary GCs ( Mesin et al., 2020 32.

B cell receptor affinity for antigen is one of the important determinants in the cell fate decision for plasma cell and GC B cell differentiation. B cells with higher affinity receptors tend to develop into plasma cells ( Kräutler et al., 2017 23. Kräutler, N.J. ∙ Suan, D. ∙ Butt, D. ...

Exp. Med. 2000; 191 :475-484 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, GC entry is in large measure gated on affinity competition for antigen ( Schwickert et al., 2011 37. Schwickert, T.A. ∙ Victora, G.D. ∙ Fooksman, D.R. ... A dynamic T cell-limited checkpoint regulates affinity-dependent B cell entry into the germinal center J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :1243-1252 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the absence of competition, B cells with relatively low-affinity receptors enter GCs but are outcompeted for entry in the presence of higher affinity cells ( Abbott et al., 2018 1. Abbott, R.K. ∙ Lee, J.H. ∙ Menis, S. ...

How affinity might influence the memory B cell fate decision has been studied primarily using transgenic B cells with pre-determined antigen binding affinities or by identifying antigen binding cells in polyclonal systems ( Smith et al., 1997 40.

Apoptosis and antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation of a single naïve B cell Science. 2015; 347 :784-787 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In elegant single B cell transfer experiments, memory cells developing after allophycocyanin immunization showed low levels of antigen binding as measured by flow cytometry ( Taylor et al., 2015 45. Taylor, J.J. ∙ Pape, K.A. ∙ Steach, H.R. ... Humoral immunity. Apoptosis and antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation of a single naïve B cell Science. 2015; 347 :784-787 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, anti-HEL transgenic B cells challenged with either high or low-affinity antigens developed higher number of memory cells in response to the lower affinity challenge ( Taylor et al., 2015 45. Taylor, J.J. ∙ Pape, K.A. ∙ Steach, H.R. ... Humoral immunity. Apoptosis and antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation of a single naïve B cell Science. 2015; 347 :784-787 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar results were also obtained when pre-memory IgG1 expressing GC B cells were examined ( Suan et al., 2017 42. Suan, D. ∙ Krautler, N.J. ∙ Maag, J.L.V. ... CCR6 Defines Memory B Cell Precursors in Mouse and Human Germinal Centers, Revealing Light-Zone Location and Predominant Low Antigen Affinity Immunity. 2017; 47 :1142-1153 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the requirement for antigen binding or transgenic receptor expression introduced a potential bias in these experiments and the precise role of affinity in shaping the memory B cell fate decision in a polyclonal immune response remains poorly understood.
Here, we report on fate-mapping experiments that directly compare the affinity of B cells entering the memory compartment with those entering or remaining in the GCs during a polyclonal immune response.

Section: Results

To analyze memory B cells formed after immunization without introducing the potential bias of detectable antigen binding affinity, we used S1pr2 -ERT2cre mice ( Shinnakasu et al., 2016 38. Shinnakasu, R. ∙ Inoue, T. ∙ Kometani, K. ... Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). S1pr2 is expressed in pre-GC and GC B cells but not in naive B cells ( Shinnakasu et al., 2016 38. Shinnakasu, R. ∙ Inoue, T. ∙ Kometani, K. ... Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A). Tamoxifen administration permanently labels S1pr2 -expressing cells with green or red fluorescent proteins in mice that carry S1pr2 -ERT2cre and Rosa26 -lox-stop-lox-ZSGreen or Rosa26 -lox-stop-lox-tdTomato ( S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 ZSGreen/+ S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 tdT/+ ) ( Madisen et al., 2010 29. Madisen, L. ∙ Zwingman, T.A. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13 :133-140 Crossref Scopus (4610) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, any plasma or memory B cells that develop from the S1pr2-expressing B cells will also be labeled ( Figure S1 A).
To examine the relationship between the GC and the memory compartment, we initially immunized S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 ZSGreen/+ mice with the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl conjugated to ovalbumin (NP-OVA) (day 0) and gave a single oral administration of tamoxifen on day 5 ( Figure 1 A). Igλ expression was used as a surrogate for antigen-specific cells, because the primary GC response to NP in C57BL/6 mice is dominated by Igλ-expressing B cells ( Jack et al., 1977 19. Jack, R.S. ∙ Imanishi-Kari, T. ∙ Rajewsky, K. Idiotypic analysis of the response of C57BL:6 mice to the (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl group Eur. J. Immunol. 1977; 7 :559-565 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas Igλ + B cells comprise an average of 5.7% of the naive follicular B cell compartment, 43% of the ZSGreen + GC B cells were Igλ + on day 14 and 35% on day 42 ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 C). In contrast, only 9.7% of the memory B cell population derived from contemporaneously labeled cells was composed of Igλ-expressing B cells when assayed on day 42 ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 D). Therefore, Igλ + B cells, and by inference NP-specific B cells, are significantly enriched in the GC on day 14 when S1pr2-expressing B cells are labeled on day 5 after immunization (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 1 C). In contrast, the memory B cells derived from S1pr2-expressing B cells labeled at the same time are not significantly enriched for Igλ expression compared to naive B cells (p = 0.4418) ( Figure 1 C). Similar results were obtained by analyzing NP binding in GC and memory B cells that had undergone switch recombination in C57Bl6 mice and S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 tdT/+ mice in the absence of tamoxifen administration ( Figure S1 B).
To determine whether responses to complex protein antigens also show differences between GC and memory compartments, we immunized S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 tdT/+ mice with an HIV-1 derived protein antigen TM4-Core (HIV-1 TM4-Core) and administered tamoxifen on day 5 ( Dosenovic et al., 2015 9. Dosenovic, P. ∙ von Boehmer, L. ∙ Escolano, A. ... Immunization for HIV-1 Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies in Human Ig Knockin Mice Cell. 2015; 161 :1505-1515 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 D). Antigen binding B cells were difficult to detect in the resting B cell population (0.3%) ( Figures 1 E and 1F). In contrast, HIV-1 TM4-Core binding cells comprised 40% of the S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 tdT/+ -labeled GC B cells on day 14 after immunization (p < 0.0001) ( Figures 1 E and 1F) and 18% on day 42 ( Figure S1 C). However, there was no significant enrichment of such cells in the S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 tdT/+ memory B cell compartment assayed on day 42 (p = 0.8687) ( Figures 1 F and S1 D). Thus, whereas antigen-specific S1pr2 expressing GC B cell precursors labeled by a single administration of tamoxifen on day 5 are highly expanded in the GC 14 days after immunization, these cells are far less enriched in the memory B cell compartment.
The number of memory B cells that emerge during an immune response varies with time ( Shinnakasu et al., 2016 38. Shinnakasu, R. ∙ Inoue, T. ∙ Kometani, K. ... Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weisel et al., 2016 54. Weisel, F.J. ∙ Zuccarino-Catania, G.V. ∙ Chikina, M. ... A Temporal Switch in the Germinal Center Determines Differential Output of Memory B and Plasma Cells Immunity. 2016; 44 :116-130 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine the relationship between contemporaneously formed GC and memory B cells at different time points during the immune response, we immunized S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 ZSGreen /+ mice with HIV-1 TM4-Core and administered a single dose of tamoxifen by oral gavage on days 9, 15, or 21 after immunization. The draining lymph nodes were assayed 3 days after tamoxifen administration ( Figure 2 A). In the absence of immunization, labeled GC, or memory B cells were nearly undetectable in the lymph node ( Figure 2 B). In contrast, we found labeled GC and memory B cells in the draining lymph nodes at all 3 time points after immunization with HIV-1 TM4-Core ( Figures 2 B–2D). The percentage of antigen binding GC cells was similar at all 3 time points with significant enrichment over the naive compartment (on average 31%, 33%, and 21% on days 12, 18, and 24, respectively) ( Figures 2 C and 2D). However, there was no significant enrichment of antigen-binding cells in the contemporaneously produced memory B cell compartment when compared to naive B cells (5.8% p = 0.2105, 3.5% p = 0.6547, and 1.4% p = 0.9724, on days 12, 18, and 24, respectively) ( Figures 2 C and 2D).
As an alternative to fate mapping by Cre and tamoxifen administration, we used Vav Tg Col1a mCherry/+ mice to examine the antigen binding properties of class-switched memory B cells formed between days 9–12 after immunization ( Gitlin et al., 2014 15. Gitlin, A.D. ∙ Shulman, Z. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Clonal selection in the germinal centre by regulated proliferation and hypermutation Nature. 2014; 509 :637-640 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). Vav Tg Col1a mCherry/+ mice express H2B-mCherry constitutively. Administration of doxycycline represses H2B-mCherry synthesis, and dividing cells dilute the marker protein in direct proportion to the number of cell divisions. Thus, resting follicular B cells express high levels of mCherry (mCherry hi ), and highly proliferative GC cells dilute it to show only low levels (mCherry low ) ( Figure 2 E). In the absence of immunization or doxycycline administration, there were few, if any, mCherry low class switched memory B cells ( Figure 2 F). Doxycycline administration 9–12 days after immunization with HIV-1 TM4-Core or NP-OVA produced mCherry low GC and memory B cells deriving from them ( Figures 2 E and 2F). mCherry low antigen binding B cells were enriched in the GC (HIV-1 TM4-Core: 26.8%; NP-OVA: 26.6%) ( Figures 2 G and 2H). However, there was no significant enrichment of mCherry low antigen binding cells in the contemporaneously produced memory B cells (HIV-1 TM4-Core: 1.7% p = 0.9647; NP-OVA: 3.5% p = 0.9606) ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Thus, memory B cells were not significantly enriched for detectable antigen binding even when antigen binding cells accounted for up to 50% of the contemporaneous GC.
To examine the B cell receptors expressed by GC and contemporaneously developing memory B cells, we characterized the antibodies produced by individual fate mapped cells on days 12, 18, or 24 after immunization ( Figures 2 A, 3 A, and S2 A). GC B cells showed a broad distribution of Ig mutations at all time points ranging from 0–29 mutations increasing significantly over time (mean of 5.7–9.3 between days 12–24, p < 0.0001) ( Figure 3 A). Contemporaneously produced memory B cell Ig genes carried significantly fewer mutations than GC B cells at all time points assayed (mean of 2.5 versus 5.7 on day 12, p < 0.0001; 3.5 versus 8.4 on day 18, p < 0.0001; and 3.7 versus 9.3 on day 24, p < 0.0001) ( Figure 3 A). Moreover, the number of mutations accumulating over time in memory B cells did not parallel the GC. There was no significant difference in mutation frequency in memory B cell antibodies over time after immunization (day 9 versus day 18, p = 0.58; day 9 versus day 24, p = 0.21) ( Figure 3 A). The same results were found by analyzing the number of amino acids mutations ( Figure S2 B). Thus, memory B cells carry fewer somatic mutations than contemporaneously produced GC cells at all time points assayed and there is no significant increase in the number of mutations in memory cells emerging at later time points.
To examine the clonal relationships between contemporaneously produced memory B cells and GC cells, we compared antibodies produced by memory and GC B cells in the same lymph node between days 9–12 after immunization ( Figure 3 B). In contrast to the GC B cells, 90% of which were part of an expanded clone, only 6.6% of the memory cells were found in expanded clones ( Figure 3 B). Moreover, only 6 out of 75 antibodies obtained from the memory compartment were represented in the 313 sequences obtained from the GC ( Figure 3 B). The memory antibodies that were shared between the 2 compartments were found as clones or singlets in the corresponding GCs ( Figure 3 B). Phylogenetic trees based on heavy and light chain nucleotide sequences indicate that 2 of the 4 memory B cell antibodies were GC-derived (LN2 yellow and LN3 red) and 2 others originated from the same B cell clone that entered the GC (LN2 red and green) ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Thus, in contrast to GC B cells, there are few expanded clones in the memory compartment, and there is limited overlap between the 2 compartments.
To compare the affinity of the B cell receptors expressed by contemporaneously developing GC and memory B cells, we produced 234 representative Fabs from fate-mapped cells ( Figures 2 A and S2 C). Biolayer interferometry was used to measure the affinity of antibodies obtained from mice on days 12, 18, or 24 after immunization with HIV-1 TM4-Core ( Figures 4 A and 4B). To document monovalent interactions, the HIV-1 TM4-Core trimer was immobilized on the biosensor chip and subsequently exposed to the cloned Fab. 3BNC60, an anti-HIV-1 CD4 binding site-specific antibody, served as a positive control, and 38 Fabs obtained from random naive follicle origin B cells as negative controls ( Figure 4 A). Fabs derived from GC B cells showed varying levels of affinity for TM4-Core at all time points assayed (K D : undetectable to >0.001 nM) ( Figures 4 B and S3 A). Overall, 32% of the GC antibodies had measurable monovalent binding affinities for TM4-Core, a number that is entirely consistent with the flow cytometry data ( Figures 1 F and 2 D). In contrast, only 2 of the 125 memory B cell Fabs showed measurable affinities in this assay (p = 0.023) ( Figures 4 B and S3 A). The difference between memory and GC B cell affinity was not directly related to number of mutations. GC antibodies with 0–5 mutations displayed the same proportion of high- and low-affinity binders as antibodies with 6–12 or greater than 13 mutations (0–5 mutations,29%; 6–12 mutations, 36%; and more than 13 mutations, 27%) ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Thus, there was no correlation between the K D and the number of mutations (r 2 = 0.079 p = 0.35) ( Figure 4 E).
Although the precise nature of the interaction between antigen and GC B cells is not known, it is believed to be polyvalent because antigen is displayed as immune complexes on follicular dendritic cells, and there are many thousands of antigen receptors on the B cell surface. Thus, our inability to find measurable affinity in over 98% of the memory B cell antibodies assayed ( Figures 4 F and 4G) may not be a true reflection of their ability to bind antigen but simply a reflection of valency and sensitivity of the assay. To begin to model polyvalent antigen-antibody interactions, we coated the biosensor chip with the Fab to create a multivalent surface and exposed the chip to the HIV-1 TM4-Core trimer in solution ( Figures 4 H, S3 B, and S3C). The Fab fragment of 3BNC60 served as a positive control and the same 38 Fabs obtained from naive B cells served as negative controls ( Figure S3 B).
We assayed 39 GC and 42 memory B cell antibodies developing 9–12 days after immunization. Of the 27 GC B cell antibodies, with no measurable monovalent binding affinity tested, 5 showed binding above the background when the Fab was used to create a multivalent surface ( Figures 4 H and S3 D). In addition, 6 of the 41 contemporaneous memory B cell antibodies showed affinity for the HIV-1 TM4-Core antigen in the same assay ( Figures 4 H, 4I, and S3 D). Similar results were also obtained with GC and memory antibodies obtained on days 15–18 or 21–24 after immunization ( Figures S3 C and S3D). To further increase valency, we multimerized the antigen using streptavidin to create tetramers ( Figure 4 J). ED38, a polyreactive antibody, served as an additional negative control for specificity ( Gitlin et al., 2016 16. Gitlin, A.D. ∙ von Boehmer, L. ∙ Gazumyan, A. ... Independent Roles of Switching and Hypermutation in the Development and Persistence of B Lymphocyte Memory Immunity. 2016; 44 :769-781 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). This increase in valency revealed that an additional 2 of the 20 GC and 8 of the 35 memory B cells antibodies assayed bind to TM4-Core ( Figures 4 J and 4K). In conclusion, increasing the valency in the binding assay reveals low-affinity interactions that were not appreciated under monovalent binding conditions ( Figures 4 G, 4I, and 4K). In total, 48.7% of the GC Fabs and 35.7% of the memory B cells Fabs show binding to HIV-1 TM4-Core. However, whereas GC B cells frequently express antibodies that can bind to antigen monovalently only a small fraction of memory cells do so ( Figures 4 G, 4I, and 4K). Conversely, memory B cell antibodies primarily bind to multimerized antigen ( Figures 4 G, 4I, and 4K). We conclude that the affinity of antibodies produced by memory B cells is significantly lower and by enlarge not representative of contemporaneously produced GC B cells.
To confirm that a small fraction of high-affinity memory B cells are produced following HIV-1 TM4-Core immunization, we purified antigen binding B cells produced between days 9 and 12 after immunization by cell sorting ( Wang et al., 2020 51. Wang, Z. ∙ Merkenschlager, J. ∙ Chen, S.T. ... Isolation of single HIV-1 Envelope specific B cells and antibody cloning from immunized rhesus macaques J. Immunol. Methods. 2020; 478 :112734 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 A). The mutational landscape of the antigen-selected populations was similar to the fate-mapped cells ( Figure S4 B). All of the GC-derived Fabs and half of those from memory B cells showed significant antigen binding by biolayer interferometry ( Figure S4 C). Thus, high-affinity memory B cells are produced after HIV-1 TM4-Core immunization, but they represent a small proportion of the memory compartment.
Memory B cells participate in recall responses by differentiating into plasmablasts and GC B cells, but the number of such cells in recall GCs is relatively small ( Mesin et al., 2020 32. Mesin, L. ∙ Schiepers, A. ∙ Ersching, J. ... Restricted Clonality and Limited Germinal Center Reentry Characterize Memory B Cell Reactivation by Boosting Cell. 2020; 180 :92-106 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). To gain further insight into the nature of the memory cells entering GCs during a recall response, we immunized S1pr2 CreERT2/+ R26 ZSGreen/+ mice with HIV-1 TM4-Core in the right footpad and labeled the emerging memory cells by tamoxifen injection on days 4 and 8. Recall responses were initiated by immunizing the left footpad with the same antigen or the control NP-OVA on day 30 ( Figure 5 A) ( Mesin et al., 2020 32. Mesin, L. ∙ Schiepers, A. ∙ Ersching, J. ... Restricted Clonality and Limited Germinal Center Reentry Characterize Memory B Cell Reactivation by Boosting Cell. 2020; 180 :92-106 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, the number of memory B cells entering the GC in the contralateral LN after challenge with cognate antigen was significantly greater than with the NP-OVA control ( Figures 5 B and 5C). The memory B cells that re-entered the GC 6 days after secondary immunization accounted for only 4% of the overall GC B cell population ( Figure 5 D). Nevertheless, nearly 30% of the recalled memory cells bound to HIV-1 TM4-Core antigen as determined by flow cytometry, a proportion that is significantly higher than the newly recruited naive B cells in the GCs in the same lymph node at this time point (p = 0.0088) ( Figures 5 E and 5F) and far higher than the overall memory B cell population ( Figures 1 E, 1F, 2 C, and 2D). Thus, rare memory B cells with affinities that allow them to compete with naive B cells for GC entry are recalled to the GC.
To study the fate of the recalled memory B cells at a later stage in the GC reaction, we analyzed the ZSGreen + GC B cells, 14 days after the second immunization ( Figure 5 G). The proportion of antigen binding recall memory cells varied between lymph nodes, however, nearly all were clonally expanded including those with relatively low antigen binding by flow cytometry and biolayer interferometry ( Figures 5 G–5J and S5 ). Thus, memory B cells can be recalled to secondary GCs and compete successfully against primary GC B cells.
Repeated immunization favors persistence of immune responses ( Cirelli et al., 2019 7. Cirelli, K.M. ∙ Carnathan, D.G. ∙ Nogal, B. ... Slow Delivery Immunization Enhances HIV Neutralizing Antibody and Germinal Center Responses via Modulation of Immunodominance Cell. 2019; 177 :1153-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fallet et al., 2020 13. Fallet, B. ∙ Hao, Y. ∙ Florova, M. ... Chronic Viral Infection Promotes Efficient Germinal Center B Cell Responses Cell Rep. 2020; 30 :1013-1026 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine how repeated immunization alters the GC and memory B cell compartments, we compared GC and memory B cells produced after one or 4 repeated immunizations with HIV-1 TM4-Core over a 60-day period ( Figure 6 A). To capture GC or memory B cells emerging during an extended period after immunization, tamoxifen was administered for 37 days after the last antigenic challenge ( Figure 6 A). In the absence of immunization, there were few if any detectable memory B cells in the draining lymph nodes ( Figure S6 A). As expected, multiple immunizations produced a significant increase in memory B cells ( Figures 6 B and 6C). In addition, the antibodies produced by GC B cells after multiple immunizations showed greater numbers of somatic mutations (15.4 versus 9.3 for 4 versus 1 immunization; p > 0.0001) ( Figure 6 D). In contrast, the number of mutations in memory B cells was indistinguishable between 1 or 4 immunizations (3.9 versus 4.3 for 4 versus 1 immunizations; p = 0.460) ( Figures 6 E and S6 B). Thus, memory B cells preferentially differentiate from B cells carrying smaller number of mutations even when the number of mutations increases in GCs.
To determine whether memory B cell antibodies obtained after multiple immunizations show increased antigen binding affinity we compared antibodies produced after 1 or 4 immunizations ( Figure S6 C). Biolayer interferometry was performed on HIV-1 TM4-Core-coated chips to obtain monovalent binding affinities and on Fab-coated chips to obtain relative affinities for multivalent binding ( Figures 6 F and 6G). None of the memory B cell antibodies showed measurable affinities in the monovalent binding assay ( Figure 6 F). Under conditions of increased valency, 4 of the Fabs produced after 4 immunizations bound to HIV-1 TM4-Core ( Figures 6 G and S6 D). Thus, repeated immunization with the same antigen increases the number of memory B cells but does not impact their somatic mutations and has little detectable effect on memory B cell antibody affinity.
To determine whether the higher affinity antibodies found in GCs are products of mutation as opposed to preferential precursor selection into GCs, we reverted 17 GC antibodies that showed measurable monovalent binding to their inferred unmutated common ancestors (UCAs) ( Figure 7 A, left panel). When tested under monovalent binding conditions, 9 of the reverted GC antibodies had measurable affinity for the HIV-1 TM4-Core immunogen ( Figure 7 A, middle panel). The remaining 8 showed binding under conditions of increased valency ( Figure 7 A, right panel). Thus, all of the GC antibodies that bound monovalently were derived from precursors with measurable binding affinity to HIV-1 TM4-Core.
We also reverted 11 GC antibodies that only showed binding under higher valency conditions ( Figure 7 C, left panel). Three of the UCAs showed detectable monovalent binding ( Figure 7 C, middle panel), 5 of the remaining UCAs bound under conditions of increased valency ( Figure 7 C, right panel). In conclusion, nearly 90% of the 28 GC B cell antibodies with measurable binding affinities developed from UCAs with measurable affinity for the immunizing antigen.
Only one of the 2 memory B cell antibodies that showed measurable monovalent binding could be expressed as the UCA and it showed no significant binding to HIV-1 TM4-Core under monovalent or polyvalent conditions ( Figure 7 B). Of the 9 memory B cell antibodies that showed measurable affinity under conditions of increased valency, 2 had no mutations, and of the 7 that were mutated ( Figure 7 D, left panel), none had measurable monovalent binding when expressed as UCAs ( Figure 7 D, middle panel) and 3 showed significant binding to HIV-1 TM4-Core under polyvalent conditions ( Figure 7 D, right panel). In addition, we reverted 23 memory B cells antibodies with no measurable binding in either assay to their UCAs, none of the reverted antibodies showed significant binding to HIV-1 TM4-Core in either assay ( Figure 7 B). Thus, of a total of 31 UCAs derived from memory B cells, none showed monovalent binding and only 3 had measurable binding under polyvalent conditions. In total, of 132 memory B cell antibodies tested that carried either no initial mutations or the UCAs of mutated antibodies, only 5 showed any measurable binding to HIV-1 TM4-Core.
In conclusion, a significant fraction of GC B cells display measurable antigen binding affinities and 90% of these cells are derived from precursors that also had measurable affinities. In contrast, approximately 10% of the contemporaneously produced memory B cells have measurable antigen binding affinities and only half of these originate from cells with demonstrable affinity. Thus, 95% of the memory compartment that emerges after HIV-1 TM4-Core immunization originates from B cells with no measurable affinity for the antigen.

Section: Discussion

To date, the memory B cell fate decision has been studied primarily using transgenic B cells or by identifying memory cells by their ability to bind antigen. We have taken an unbiased fate mapping approach in mice with an intact immune system. The mice were immunized with an HIV-1 antigen to understand the relationship between B cells entering the memory compartment and contemporaneous GC B cells. A large fraction of the B cells in the GC expressed high-affinity B cell receptors that were derived from UCAs with significant affinity. In contrast, the great majority of contemporaneously selected memory B cells express receptors with very low-affinity for the antigen.
Elegant single cell transfer experiments indicated that following cell division, a single precursor could give rise to multiple B cell fates including memory B cells ( Taylor et al., 2015 45. Taylor, J.J. ∙ Pape, K.A. ∙ Steach, H.R. ... Humoral immunity. Apoptosis and antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation of a single naïve B cell Science. 2015; 347 :784-787 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). When identified by means of antigen binding, precursors that produced both plasma and memory cells were found to bind fewer antigens than those that produced just plasma cells. In addition, transgenic B cells produced more memory B cells when challenged with lower than higher affinity antigens ( Taylor et al., 2015 45. Taylor, J.J. ∙ Pape, K.A. ∙ Steach, H.R. ... Humoral immunity. Apoptosis and antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation of a single naïve B cell Science. 2015; 347 :784-787 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pre-memory B cells in the GC light zone also bind lower amounts of antigen than other cells in the same compartment ( Suan et al., 2017 42. Suan, D. ∙ Krautler, N.J. ∙ Maag, J.L.V. ... CCR6 Defines Memory B Cell Precursors in Mouse and Human Germinal Centers, Revealing Light-Zone Location and Predominant Low Antigen Affinity Immunity. 2017; 47 :1142-1153 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our experiments directly compare the affinity of antibodies expressed by B cells in contemporaneous memory and GC compartments. Under monovalent binding conditions, 30.7% of GC and only 2.3% of memory B cells showed measurable binding in biolayer interferometry assays. These numbers increased to 48.7% and 35.7%, respectively, in an assay with artificially increased valency where the Fabs were immobilized on the sensogram chips and exposed to tetramers of trimeric antigen. Thus, nascent memory cells bind to antigen but require high valency interactions that increase the apparent affinity through avidity effects resulting in a compartment with much lower overall affinities than the contemporaneous GC.
Although increasing valency by tetramerizing the antigen revealed low-affinity interactions, it is likely that this under-represents what may be happening in vivo where high-density bivalent receptors on the B cell surface interact with immune complexes. Thus, our inability to detect binding does not rule out a low-affinity interaction at high levels of valency. Finally, the difference between GC and memory B cells was not related to the number of somatic mutations, because the difference in affinity is also seen when comparing GC and memory B cells with 5 or fewer mutations.
The vast majority of the memory B cell compartment is composed of cells expressing low-affinity receptors, nevertheless the memory compartment in both humans and mice contains a small number of B cells that carry high-affinity antibodies that can be identified by their ability to bind antigen ( Figure S4 ). In humans infected with HIV-1, memory B cells purified on the basis of antigen binding show high antigen binding and neutralizing activities ( Scheid et al., 2011 36. Scheid, J.F. ∙ Mouquet, H. ∙ Ueberheide, B. ... Sequence and structural convergence of broad and potent HIV antibodies that mimic CD4 binding Science. 2011; 333 :1633-1637 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar ). This phenomenon is not limited to HIV-1 infection, because high-affinity memory B cells also develop in response to ZIKA ( Robbiani et al., 2017 34. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Bozzacco, L. ∙ Keeffe, J.R. ... Recurrent Potent Human Neutralizing Antibodies to Zika Virus in Brazil and Mexico Cell. 2017; 169 :597-609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ), SARS-CoV ( Traggiai et al., 2004 47. Traggiai, E. ∙ Becker, S. ∙ Subbarao, K. ... An efficient method to make human monoclonal antibodies from memory B cells: potent neutralization of SARS coronavirus Nat. Med. 2004; 10 :871-875 Crossref Scopus (605) PubMed Google Scholar ), influenza ( Laursen and Wilson, 2013 26. Laursen, N.S. ∙ Wilson, I.A. Broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses Antiviral Res. 2013; 98 :476-483 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), malaria ( Julien and Wardemann, 2019 20. Julien, J.P. ∙ Wardemann, H. Antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum malaria at the molecular level Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :761-775 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), and SARS-CoV-2 ( Robbiani et al., 2020 35. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (1287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings are not inconsistent with these earlier experiments; the key difference is that the fate mapping approach is not biased by selection for memory B cells that bind antigen.
In the GC, cells compete for limiting T follicular helper cells (Tfh) help based on their ability to bind, internalize, and present antigen ( Gitlin et al., 2014 15. Gitlin, A.D. ∙ Shulman, Z. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Clonal selection in the germinal centre by regulated proliferation and hypermutation Nature. 2014; 509 :637-640 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ; Victora et al., 2010 48.

Germinal center dynamics revealed by multiphoton microscopy with a photoactivatable fluorescent reporter Cell. 2010; 143 :592-605 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (899) PubMed Google Scholar ). The interaction with Tfh cells leads to activation of a gene expression program that depends on the amount of antigen presented ( Finkin et al., 2019 14. Finkin, S. ∙ Hartweger, H. ∙ Oliveira, T.Y. ... Protein Amounts of the MYC Transcription Factor Determine Germinal Center B Cell Division Capacity Immunity. 2019; 51 :324-336 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shinnakasu et al., 2016 38.

Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas B cells receiving greater levels of help upregulate genes required for proliferation ( Finkin et al., 2019 14. Finkin, S. ∙ Hartweger, H. ∙ Oliveira, T.Y. ... Protein Amounts of the MYC Transcription Factor Determine Germinal Center B Cell Division Capacity Immunity. 2019; 51 :324-336 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) or plasma cell differentiation ( Ise and Kurosaki, 2019 18. Ise, W. ∙ Kurosaki, T. Plasma cell differentiation during the germinal center reaction Immunol Rev. 2019; 288 :64-74 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), lower levels of antigen presentation result in fewer divisions ( Finkin et al., 2019 14. Finkin, S. ∙ Hartweger, H. ∙ Oliveira, T.Y. ... Protein Amounts of the MYC Transcription Factor Determine Germinal Center B Cell Division Capacity Immunity. 2019; 51 :324-336 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) and decreased Bach2 expression that is associated with memory B cell development ( Shinnakasu et al., 2016 38. Shinnakasu, R. ∙ Inoue, T. ∙ Kometani, K. ... Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our observation that the largest expanded clones in the GC are poorly represented in the memory compartment is consistent with the idea that memory development in the GC favors B cells with lower affinity receptors that undergo fewer divisions.
Moreover, our data indicate that there is little, if any, increase in the number of B cells with higher numbers of mutations entering the memory compartment at later stages in the immune response. In addition, this phenomenon is not altered by repeated immunization. Because mutation is directly related to cell division, and GC cells divide every 4–6 h, the relatively low number of mutations indicates that most of the B cells joining the memory compartment during the later stages of the immune response have spent very little time dividing in the GC.
GC entry is dependent on the relative affinity of a precursor B cell for antigen. B cells that capture antigen compete for limiting help provided by T follicular helper cells ( Schwickert et al., 2011 37. Schwickert, T.A. ∙ Victora, G.D. ∙ Fooksman, D.R. ... A dynamic T cell-limited checkpoint regulates affinity-dependent B cell entry into the germinal center J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :1243-1252 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, when transgenic B cells expressing receptors with different affinities for the same antigen compete, only the higher affinity cells enter the GC ( Schwickert et al., 2011 37. Schwickert, T.A. ∙ Victora, G.D. ∙ Fooksman, D.R. ... A dynamic T cell-limited checkpoint regulates affinity-dependent B cell entry into the germinal center J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :1243-1252 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under physiologic circumstances, each GC is seeded by dozens of GC B cell precursors expressing receptors with a broad range of affinities ( Tas et al., 2016 43. Tas, J.M. ∙ Mesin, L. ∙ Pasqual, G. ... Visualizing antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers Science. 2016; 351 :1048-1054 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our fate mapping approach to understand the nature of polyclonal B cells seeding GCs in response to an HIV-1 antigen extends prior observations and demonstrates that most GC B cells with measurable affinities for antigen evolved from precursors that express UCAs with measurable antigen binding affinities.
High-affinity B cells comprise a small minority of the memory compartment, nevertheless they play an essential role in recall responses by rapidly differentiating into antibody-producing plasma cells ( Akkaya et al., 2020 2. Akkaya, M. ∙ Kwak, K. ∙ Pierce, S.K. B cell memory: building two walls of protection against pathogens Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :229-238 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, a small number of such cells can re-enter the GC ( Mesin et al., 2020 32. Mesin, L. ∙ Schiepers, A. ∙ Ersching, J. ... Restricted Clonality and Limited Germinal Center Reentry Characterize Memory B Cell Reactivation by Boosting Cell. 2020; 180 :92-106 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our experiments indicate that a significant fraction of recall memory B cells entering secondary GCs are competitive with their naive counterparts because they are selected based on their affinity for the antigen. However, memory cells that re-enter secondary GCs include cells expressing receptors with affinities below the thresholds required for detection by flow cytometry. Re-activation of memory B cells with lower affinities could be facilitated by intrinsic differences in gene expression, epigenetic modifications ( Li et al., 2013 27. Li, G. ∙ Zan, H. ∙ Xu, Z. ... Epigenetics of the antibody response Trends Immunol. 2013; 34 :460-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cytoskeleton organization between memory B cells and the other B cells populations ( Kwak et al., 2019 25. Kwak, K. ∙ Akkaya, M. ∙ Pierce, S.K. B cell signaling in context Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :963-969 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tolar, 2017 46. Tolar, P. Cytoskeletal control of B cell responses to antigens Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :621-634 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The memory B cell compartment displays many of the important features predicted by Burnett, Talmage, and Lederberg in their clonal selection theory ( Burnet, 1960 6. Burnet, M. The clonal selection theory of acquired immunity Yale J Biol Med. 1960; 32 :480 Google Scholar ), including expanded groups of antigen selected cells, a small number of which can rapidly develop into high-affinity antibody producing plasma cells. However, the vast preponderance of memory cells with little or no measurable affinity for antigen was unexpected. Why would the immune system select for a diverse group of low-affinity B cells in the memory compartment? We speculate that one of the important functions of the memory compartment is to provide an expanded pool of cells that can anticipate infection with related pathogens. This might be particularly valuable in dealing with a mutating pathogen like HIV-1 or influenza. Broadly neutralizing antibody development during HIV-1 infection involves co-evolution of the antibody with the virus over a period of 1–3 years ( Bonsignori et al., 2017 5. Bonsignori, M. ∙ Liao, H.X. ∙ Gao, F. ... Antibody-virus co-evolution in HIV infection: paths for HIV vaccine development Immunol. Rev. 2017; 275 :145-160 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liao et al., 2013 28. Liao, H.X. ∙ Lynch, R. ∙ Zhou, T. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Co-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus Nature. 2013; 496 :469-476 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar ). This unusual immune response requires recall GC responses to viral escape variants by B cells producing receptors with low affinity for the immunogen ( Liao et al., 2013 28. Liao, H.X. ∙ Lynch, R. ∙ Zhou, T. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Co-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus Nature. 2013; 496 :469-476 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar ). An expanded population of memory cells with some affinity for closely related viruses could also mitigate repeated infections with closely related and rapidly emerging variants of viruses like those that comprise the Orthocoronavirinae .

Activation of the Cre recombinase in the S1pr2 -ERT2cre mice was induced by one oral administration of 12mg tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) in 200 μL of Corn oil (Sigma, C8267) at the indicated time point, followed by a weekly intraperitoneal injection of 2mg tamoxifen in 100 μL of Corn oil where indicated. mCherry dilution was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg of doxycycline (Sigma D9891) in 1X PBS followed by supplementing the drinking water for the next 3 days with 1g/L of doxycycline and 5% sucrose (Sigma S0389).
Lymph nodes (axillary or popliteal) were collected in FACS buffer (PBS1X, 10%FCS, 2mM EDTA) on ice. Single-cell suspensions were obtained by mechanical disruption through a 70-mm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Erythrocytes were lysed with 1 mL of ACK lysing buffer (GIBCO). After incubation with 5 μg/ml of anti-CD16/32 (rat mAb 2.4G2, mouse Fc block BD) for 15 min at 4°C, cell surface antigens were stained for 30 min at 4°C.

The linearized human Fab vector (30-50ng) and the insert (4 μL of purified product) were ligated at 25°C for 2.5 min. Ligation was transformed in DH5α competent bacteria. Next day, bacterial colonies were analyzed by PCR. PCR protocol 1x (95°C 15min) 50x (94°C 30 s-57°C 30S-72°C 55 s) 1x (72°C 10min).
Germline versions of mutated Fabs were produced by reverting all nucleotide mutations in the V(D)J antibody genes to their corresponding inferred germline sequences while conserving the N nucleotides from the V(D)J junctions found in the mutated antibodies.
Ig sequences were cloned into human IgH Fab and IgK plasmids and Fabs were expressed by transient transfection of HEK293-6E cells and purified with Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). After buffer exchange in PBS, the Fab yield productivity was checked by measurement with nanodrop and PAGE analysis.
Biolayer interferometry assays were performed on the Octet Red instrument (ForteBio) at 30°C with shaking at 1,000rpm.
All measurements of HIV-1 TM4-Core/Fabs binding were corrected by subtracting the signal obtained from traces performed with HIV-1 TM4-Core but in absence of Fabs. The same trimer used for the immunization was biotinylated using EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin at a ratio of one biotin molecule per trimer and un-ligated biotin was removed using Zebra desalting columns (Thermo Scientific, 21330). The kinetic analysis using high precision streptavidin biosensor (ForteBio 18-5118) was performed as follows: (1) baseline: 60sec immersion in buffer (kinetics buffer 10x ForteBio 18-1105). (2) loading: 200sec immersion in a solution with Biotinylated trimeric TM4-core at 400nM. (3) baseline: 200sec immersion in buffer. (4) Association: 300sec immersion in solution with Fab 10 μg/mL (5) dissociation: 600sec immersion in buffer. Curve fitting was performed using a fast 2:1 binding model and the Data analysis software (ForteBio). Mean K D values were determined by averaging all binding curves that matched the theoretical fit with an R 2 value ≥ 0.98.
All measurements of Fab/TM4-Core binding were corrected by subtracting the signal obtained from traces performed with the same Fab but in absence of TM4-Core. The kinetic analysis using FAB2G biosensor (ForteBio 18-5125) was performed as for the affinity measurement. Curve fitting was performed using a bivalent model and the Data analysis software (ForteBio). Mean K D values were determined by averaging all binding curves that matched the theoretical fit with an R 2 value ≥ 0.9. The same protocol was used with multimerized TM4-Core.
Statistical information, including n (number of mice or cells per group), number of replicates, mean (center bars) and statistical significance values, is indicated in the figure legends. None specific method was used to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach. Statistical significance was determined with Graphpad Prism 7 using the tests indicated in each figure. Data were considered statistically significant at ∗ p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.0001.
