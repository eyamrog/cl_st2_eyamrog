Title: TRIM7 inhibits enterovirus replication and promotes emergence of a viral variant with increased pathogenicity


Abstract: Summary

To control viral infection, vertebrates rely on both inducible interferon responses and less well-characterized cell-intrinsic responses composed of “at the ready” antiviral effector proteins. Here, we show that E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM7 is a cell-intrinsic antiviral effector that restricts multiple human enteroviruses by targeting viral 2BC, a membrane remodeling protein, for ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Selective pressure exerted by TRIM7 results in emergence of a TRIM7-resistant coxsackievirus with a single point mutation in the viral 2C ATPase/helicase. In cultured cells, the mutation helps the virus evade TRIM7 but impairs optimal viral replication, and this correlates with a hyperactive and structurally plastic 2C ATPase. Unexpectedly, the TRIM7-resistant virus has a replication advantage in mice and causes lethal pancreatitis. These findings reveal a unique mechanism for targeting enterovirus replication and provide molecular insight into the benefits and trade-offs of viral evolution imposed by a host restriction factor.

Section: Introduction

The mammalian innate immune system controls viral infection in part through the actions of protein-based antiviral effectors. While many of these effectors are only expressed after viral infection triggers an interferon response ( Schoggins, 2019 62. Schoggins, J.W. Interferon-Stimulated Genes: What Do They All Do? Annu. Rev. Virol. 2019; 6 :567-584 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ), cell-intrinsic restriction factors are constitutively present and variably regulated by interferon. These cell-intrinsic effectors provide a frontline defense against viruses prior to transcription of interferon and interferon-stimulated genes.
Several E3 ligases have been identified as cell-intrinsic antiviral effectors. In many, but not all, cases, E3 ligases target viral proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( van Gent et al., 2018 75. van Gent, M. ∙ Sparrer, K.M.J. ∙ Gack, M.U.

For example, tripartite-motif-containing protein 5 (TRIM5) targets the protease of tick-borne encephalitis virus for ubiquitin-dependent degradation ( Chiramel et al., 2019 12.

Together, the known antiviral TRIMs (approximately seven) constitute a small fraction of the RING-type E3 ligase protein family, which likely contains more uncharacterized antiviral effectors.
Since several TRIM proteins target RNA viruses, we hypothesized that enteroviruses in the Picornaviridae family may also be susceptible to antiviral E3 ligases. The Picornaviridae family includes important human pathogens and model laboratory viruses, such as coxsackieviruses, poliovirus (PV), enterovirus A71 (EV71), and echoviruses. Using a genetic screen, we identified TRIM7 as an inhibitor of multiple human enteroviruses. We reveal the mechanism by which TRIM7 suppresses enterovirus replication and demonstrate that TRIM7-mediated inhibition can be overcome by a single point mutation in a viral protein. The TRIM7-resistant virus has reduced replicative fitness in cultured cells but an unexpected increased fitness advantage in vivo , leading to disseminated infection and severe pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first E3 ligase targeting an enterovirus protein and the first demonstration that a viral membrane remodeling protein is subject to degradation as a host antiviral strategy. The TRIM7-resistant coxsackievirus highlights a unique mechanism of viral innovation and may also serve as a novel tool in experimental animal models of severe pancreatitis.

Section: Results

To identify E3 ubiquitin ligases that modulate viral infection, we screened a lentivirus-based cDNA library containing 118 human RING-type E3 ligases for genes that inhibit a GFP-expressing coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3- GFP) when individually expressed ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ; Schoggins et al., 2011 63. Schoggins, J.W. ∙ Wilson, S.J. ∙ Panis, M. ... A diverse range of gene products are effectors of the type I interferon antiviral response Nature. 2011; 472 :481-485 Crossref Scopus (1844) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression of TRIM7 showed a specific and potent inhibition of CVB3 infection, with no inhibition of flaviviruses, alphaviruses, paramyxoviruses, hepatitis C virus, or a non-replicating adenovirus type 5 vector ( Figures 1 A and S1 B). The antiviral effect of TRIM7 occurred independently of cell type, as TRIM7 expression in HeLa, Huh7.5, 293T, U251, HCT116, RD, and U2OS cells significantly restricted CVB3 infection ( Figure S1 C). TRIM7 also inhibited non-reporter CVB3 in HeLa cells at multiple time points and MOIs, with as much as a 10,000-fold reduction in viral yield at 12 h post-infection ( Figures 1 B and 1C).
To determine whether TRIM7 inhibits other enteroviruses, HeLa cells expressing a 3x-FLAG-tagged TRIM7 (HeLa-TRIM7) were infected with three different human enterovirus types, including EV71 (type A), CVB3 and E11 (type B), and PV (type C), and the non-human enterovirus mengovirus (MenV). Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is produced during replication, was quantified by flow cytometry. TRIM7 expression significantly reduced viral dsRNA production in cells infected with EV71, CVB3, E11, and PV, but not MenV ( Figure 1 D). Accordingly, viral titers of EV71, CVB3, E11, EVD68, and PV in the supernatants of infected HeLa-TRIM7 cells were 10- to 250-fold lower than titers from control HeLa cells expressing firefly luciferase (HeLa-Fluc) ( Figures 1 E–1H). In contrast, there was no difference in the titers of MenV in HeLa-TRIM7 compared to HeLa-Fluc ( Figure 1 I).
To assess whether endogenous TRIM7, as opposed to ectopically expressed protein, inhibits enterovirus, we silenced TRIM7 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and confirmed knockdown efficiency by western blotting ( Figure S1 D). Depletion of TRIM7 significantly increased production of CVB3 at 8 h post-infection ( Figure 1 J). Similar results were observed in HepG2 cells at 12 and 24 h post-infection with CVB3 ( Figure S1 E) and 8 h post-infection with E11 ( Figure S1 F). Collectively, our data demonstrate that TRIM7 is an intrinsic antiviral factor that inhibits human enteroviruses.
We next assessed which step in the viral replication cycle is targeted by TRIM7. Using confocal microscopy to visualize viral particles and plaque assay to quantitate bound and internalized virions, we observed no effect of TRIM7 on binding or entry ( Figures 2 A–2D). Next, we transfected CVB3-GFP infectious viral RNA into HeLa-TRIM7 and HeLa-Fluc cells to measure replication when entry is bypassed. Compared to control HeLa-Fluc cells, which had robust GFP signal after viral RNA transfection, GFP was not detected in HeLa-TRIM7 cells at any time point ( Figure 2 E). Accordingly, the yield of infectious virus from RNA-transfected cells was barely detectable from TRIM7-expressing cells ( Figure 2 F). Similar results were obtained with PV-GFP RNA ( Figure 2 G), indicating that TRIM7 restricts enterovirus replication after viral binding and entry.
We analyzed viral RNA translation and/or replication using subgenomic replicons expressing a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter. This truncated viral RNA lacks genes that encode structural proteins but otherwise replicates and expresses viral proteins and Rluc reporter. Upon transfection of the wild-type (WT) CVB3 replicon CVB3-Rluc into HeLa-TRIM7 or HeLa-Fluc cells, we observed a similar luciferase signal during the primary translation phase (up to 4 h post-transfection) ( Figure 2 H). Starting at 4.5 h post-transfection, an increase in luciferase signal was observed in HeLa-Fluc, but not HeLa-TRIM7. To monitor viral translation in the absence of replication, we constructed a replication-deficient replicon, CVB3-Rluc (3D-GDDmut). Similar levels of Rluc signal from this replicon were observed in HeLa-TRIM7 and HeLa-Fluc cells at all time points ( Figure 2 I), indicating that TRIM7 inhibits viral replication and not translation. We also used strand-specific RT-PCR to distinguish the production of positive-strand and negative-strand viral RNA (+vRNA and −vRNA). In HeLa-TRIM7 cells, the production of +vRNA was significantly reduced, and −vRNA was barely detectable ( Figure 2 J), which correlated with a near-complete loss of intracellular virus production ( Figure 2 K). These results demonstrate that TRIM7 restricts CVB3 by suppressing viral RNA replication.
Since TRIM7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase ( Montori-Grau et al., 2018 47. Montori-Grau, M. ∙ Pedreira-Casahuga, R. ∙ Boyer-Díaz, Z. ... GNIP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase is a novel player in regulating glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle Metabolism. 2018; 83 :177-187 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that it may target a viral protein or viral host dependency factor for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We treated TRIM7-expressing cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and observed a striking rescue of CVB3-GFP infection and production ( Figures S2 A–S2C). High doses of MG132 modestly impaired infection in control HeLa-Fluc cells, as previously reported ( Si et al., 2008 68. Si, X. ∙ Gao, G. ∙ Wong, J. ... Ubiquitination is required for effective replication of coxsackievirus B3 PLoS ONE. 2008; 3 :e2585 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Time-of-addition studies revealed that MG132 treatment failed to rescue infection in TRIM7-expressing cells when added at later time points (after primary translation, >4 h) ( Figures S2 A and S2C). This suggests that virus infection in TRIM7-expressing cells can be salvaged by inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation before or very early during infection. N2,N4-dibenzylquinazoline-2,4-diamine (DBeQ), an inhibitor of the VCP/p97-ATPase complex, failed to rescue viral replication in TRIM7-expressing cells ( Figure S2 D), suggesting that TRIM7 does not inhibit viral replication through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation or autophagy pathways. DBeQ modestly reduced CVB3 infectivity in HeLa-Fluc cells, as previously shown ( Wang et al., 2017 77. Wang, T. ∙ Wang, B. ∙ Huang, H. ... Enterovirus 71 protease 2Apro and 3Cpro differentially inhibit the cellular endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway via distinct mechanisms, and enterovirus 71 hijacks ERAD component p97 to promote its replication PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006674 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inhibitors of autophagosome-lysosome degradation, bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, had no impact on CVB3 infectivity in control HeLa-Fluc cells, nor did they reverse the antiviral effects of TRIM7, although these drugs inhibited replication of vesicular stomatitis virus ( Figures S2 E and S2F), as previously reported ( Johannsdottir et al., 2009 34. Johannsdottir, H.K. ∙ Mancini, R. ∙ Kartenbeck, J. ... Host cell factors and functions involved in vesicular stomatitis virus entry J. Virol. 2009; 83 :440-453 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2007 40. Lee, H.K. ∙ Lund, J.M. ∙ Ramanathan, B. ... Autophagy-dependent viral recognition by plasmacytoid dendritic cells Science. 2007; 315 :1398-1401 Crossref Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar results with these drugs were observed during PV-GFP infection ( Figure S2 G). These data indicate that TRIM7 functions through a proteasome-dependent pathway to inhibit enterovirus replication.
To examine the mechanism of action of TRIM7, we used an evolutionary genetic approach, hypothesizing that TRIM7 may impose a selective pressure that facilitates emergence of resistant variants ( Duggal and Emerman, 2012 17. Duggal, N.K. ∙ Emerman, M. Evolutionary conflicts between viruses and restriction factors shape immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :687-695 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). We serially passaged CVB3 in HeLa-TRIM7 or HeLa-Fluc cells and found that the fourth passage of CVB3 from HeLa-TRIM7 cells induced cytopathic effects in HeLa-TRIM7 cells ( Figure S3 A). This suggested emergence of a TRIM7-resistant CVB3, herein referred to as CVB3/TRIM7-R. A serially passaged CVB3 from control HeLa-Fluc cells was named CVB3/CTRL. We verified that CVB3/TRIM7-R was infectious by dsRNA immunofluorescence ( Figure S3 A). We then isolated CVB3/TRIM7-R from single plaques, performed consensus sequencing, and identified a unique single-nucleotide A-to-G mutation at position 5,009, which results in a T323A missense variant in the viral 2C protein ( Figure 3 A). We cloned T323A into the CVB3-GFP molecular clone and found that the resulting virus, CVB3/T323A-GFP, replicated in TRIM7-expressing cells, in contrast to the parental CVB3/WT-GFP ( Figure 3 B).
Enterovirus 2C is an ATPase/helicase that is critical for intracellular membrane rearrangement, the formation of virus-induced cytoplasmic vesicles, and viral RNA replication ( Baggen et al., 2018 7. Baggen, J. ∙ Thibaut, H.J. ∙ Strating, J.R.P.M. ... The life cycle of non-polio enteroviruses and how to target it Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16 :368-381 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2C is formed by proteolytic processing of the precursor 2BC, which itself is the product of a larger pre-processed 2ABC precursor generated from the viral polyprotein. The crystal structures of 2C from EV71 and PV show that T323 is part of C-terminal helix α6 (T323 or C323 to P329) of 2C, which forms the pocket-binding motif (PBM) that binds the hydrophobic pocket between the zinc-finger and ATPase domains in 2C ( Guan et al., 2017 26. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Qin, B. ... Crystal structure of 2C helicase from enterovirus 71 Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1602573 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 27. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Zhang, C. ... Crystal structure of a soluble fragment of poliovirus 2CATPase PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007304 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, the side chain of residue T323 of EV71 2C binds the hydrophobic pocket in 2C ( Guan et al., 2017 26. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Qin, B. ... Crystal structure of 2C helicase from enterovirus 71 Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1602573 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequence alignment revealed that T323 is highly conserved in type B enteroviruses, with only three non-human primate enteroviruses (EV-B112, EV-B113, and EV-B114 [or SA5]; Mombo et al., 2017 46. Mombo, I.M. ∙ Lukashev, A.N. ∙ Bleicker, T. ... African non-human primates host diverse enteroviruses PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0169067 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) differing by having valine instead of threonine at this position ( Figure S3 B). We assessed TRIM7 antiviral activity on SA5 and found that TRIM7 expression restricted SA5 replication, but only ∼10-fold more than Fluc control, as compared to the 10,000-fold inhibition of CVB3 replication ( Figures S3 C and 1 B). Consistent with the variable antiviral effects of TRIM7 on non-type-B human enteroviruses ( Figure 1 ), these data raise the possibility that TRIM7 exerts a range of antiviral activities depending on the enterovirus 2C sequence. Surprisingly, we noticed that a single clinical isolate of human echovirus 18 (E18) from an outbreak in Germany has an isoleucine (Ile/I) at position 323 in 2C ( Figure S3 D), whereas other E18 isolates have a conserved T323 ( Krumbholz et al., 2016 37. Krumbholz, A. ∙ Egerer, R. ∙ Braun, H. ... Analysis of an echovirus 18 outbreak in Thuringia, Germany: insights into the molecular epidemiology and evolution of several enterovirus species B members Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 2016; 205 :471-483 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore, synthesized infectious molecular clones of E18 bearing T323 or I323. Both viruses had similar growth kinetics, and E18-I323 partially resisted inhibition by human TRIM7 and mouse Trim7 ( Figures S3 E–S3G). These data indicate that both laboratory-adapted CVB3 and a natural variant of E18 have increased resistance to TRIM7-mediated inhibition via a point mutation in 2C.
To understand how T323A confers resistance to TRIM7, we used StrepII-3XFLAG tandem affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to identify viral proteins that may interact with TRIM7 during infection ( Figure S4 A). Most CVB3 viral proteins co-precipitated with TRIM7, with 2C protein being the top hit ( Figures S4 B and S4C; Table S3 ). Interaction of 2C and 2BC, but not 2B, with TRIM7 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) using hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged viral proteins as bait ( Figure 3 C). Next, we generated TRIM7 truncations to determine the domain that interacts with 2BC ( Figure 3 D). We also made E3 ubiquitin “ligase-dead” TRIM7 (TRIM7-CA) to prevent degradation of putative interacting factors. We found that the C-terminal PRY/SPRY domain of TRIM7 is required for interaction with 2BC ( Figures 3 E and 3F) and that a TRIM7-PRY/SPRY mutant (TRIM7-ΔPS) failed to colocalize with 2BC ( Figure 3 G). Localization of 2C and 2BC to lipid droplets (LDs) is critical for formation of viral replication complexes ( Laufman et al., 2019 39. Laufman, O. ∙ Perrino, J. ∙ Andino, R. Viral Generated Inter-Organelle Contacts Redirect Lipid Flux for Genome Replication Cell. 2019; 178 :275-289.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suhy et al., 2000 70. Suhy, D.A. ∙ Giddings, Jr., T.H. ∙ Kirkegaard, K. Remodeling the endoplasmic reticulum by poliovirus infection and by individual viral proteins: an autophagy-like origin for virus-induced vesicles J. Virol. 2000; 74 :8953-8965 Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that when ectopically expressed alone, the majority of 2BC localized to LDs, as previously reported ( Laufman et al., 2019 39. Laufman, O. ∙ Perrino, J. ∙ Andino, R. Viral Generated Inter-Organelle Contacts Redirect Lipid Flux for Genome Replication Cell. 2019; 178 :275-289.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a small fraction of TRIM7 also localized near LDs ( Figure 3 H). Notably, when TRIM7 was co-expressed with 2BC, most of the TRIM7 signal was found adjacent to 2BC on LDs ( Figure 3 I). To examine TRIM7-2BC interactions during infection, we used biochemical fractionation of CVB3-infected cells. The majority of 2ABC, 2BC, and 2C was detected in the ER fraction, with a smaller proportion of these proteins found in LD fractions ( Figure 3 J). Compared to uninfected cells, TRIM7 was also enriched in both the ER and LD fractions during virus infection ( Figure 3 J). Thus, while ectopic expression and bona fide viral infection result in distinct partitioning patterns of 2BC to LD or ER, in both cases, TRIM7 becomes enriched in these compartments when 2BC is present, suggesting that an interaction between the TRIM7 and 2BC is critical for the observed antiviral effects.
To determine how CVB3/T323A overcomes TRIM7-mediated inhibition, we tested whether the T323A mutation in 2C modulates interactions between TRIM7 and 2BC or 2C. We performed a coIP assay to assess interactions between ligase-dead TRIM7-CA and 2BC, 2BC-T323A, or 2BC lacking the C-terminal PBM (2BC-ΔPBM). Compared to WT 2BC, 2BC-T323A had reduced interaction with TRIM7, whereas interactions of TRIM7 and 2BC-ΔPBM were nearly ablated ( Figure 3 M). We further evaluated the interaction between TRIM7 and 2C with an N-terminal truncation by in vitro pull-down assay using proteins purified recombinantly in E. coli. Consistent with the coIP results, TRIM7 was pulled down by 2CΔN/WT, whereas pull-down efficiency was reduced with 2CΔN/T323A ( Figure 3 N). Together, these data indicate that the T323A mutation in CVB3 2C impairs the interaction between 2BC and TRIM7 that is required for TRIM7-mediated restriction of CVB3 replication.
Since TRIM7 binds 2C and 2BC, we tested whether TRIM7 targets either by co-expressing proteins in 293T cells. We also tested other viral nonstructural proteins, since coIP/mass spectrometry revealed that some of them may interact with TRIM7 ( Figure S4 C). Expression of TRIM7 resulted in reduced levels of HA-2BC, but not other viral proteins ( Figure 4 A), including HA-2C( Figure 3 C). TRIM7 triggered 2BC degradation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 4 B and 4C). A ligase-dead TRIM7-CA did not affect HA-2BC levels, consistent with its loss of antiviral activity ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Moreover, proteasome inhibition by MG132 restored HA-2BC protein in the presence of TRIM7 ( Figure 4 F). Similar results were obtained with 2BC from other TRIM7-targeted enteroviruses, including EV71 and EVD68, whereas 2BC from TRIM7-insensitive MenV was unaffected ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Accordingly, 2BC from EV71, but not MenV, interacted with TRIM7 in pull-down assays ( Figure 4 I). These data suggest that the antiviral mechanism of action of TRIM7 is selective targeting of enterovirus 2BC for proteasomal degradation.
Lys48-linked ubiquitination of substrates is important for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( Grice and Nathan, 2016 25. Grice, G.L. ∙ Nathan, J.A. The recognition of ubiquitinated proteins by the proteasome Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 73 :3497-3506 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used a cell-based transfection assay to determine whether CVB3 2BC could immunoprecipitate ubiquitin in the presence of TRIM7. Indeed, in the presence of TRIM7, but not ligase-dead TRIM7-CA, HA-2BC pulled down more Strep-tagged WT ubiquitin (Strep-WT.Ubi) or K48-only ubiquitin (Strep-K48.Ubi) ( Figure 4 J). Furthermore, TRIM7, but not ligase-dead TRIM7-CA, promoted the ubiquitination of 2BC in an in vitro ubiquitination assay ( Figure 4 K). These results further support a model in which TRIM7 modifies enterovirus 2BC protein by K48-linked ubiquitination, leading to degradation of 2BC by the proteasome.
While adaptive mutation in 2C in an experimental setting helps the virus overcome TRIM7-mediated restriction, we did not find in sequence databases any naturally occurring 2C-T323A variants in human type B enteroviruses. However, as mentioned above, a single isolate of human echovirus 18 was reported to have a T323I mutation in 2C ( Krumbholz et al., 2016 37. Krumbholz, A. ∙ Egerer, R. ∙ Braun, H. ... Analysis of an echovirus 18 outbreak in Thuringia, Germany: insights into the molecular epidemiology and evolution of several enterovirus species B members Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 2016; 205 :471-483 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), which conferred partial resistance to TRIM7 ( Figure S3 D). We therefore examined the impact of T323A on viral fitness. As previously noted, CVB3-T323A has impaired viral production when compared to CVB3-WT in the absence of ectopically expressed TRIM7 ( Figure 5 A). We further confirmed reduced replicative fitness of CVB3-T323A in HeLa cells using strand-specific RT-PCR; compared to CVB3-WT, lower levels of both positive- and negative-strand RNA of the mutant virus were detected ( Figure 5 B). We also observed greater than 100-fold reduction in intracellular CVB3-T323A virus production during a single replication cycle as compared to CVB3-WT ( Figure 5 C), suggesting a fitness cost to the virus for overcoming TRIM7-mediated restriction.
To study mechanisms underlying this fitness cost, we first asked whether T323A affects 2C oligomerization, which is required for optimal ATPase activity ( Guan et al., 2017 26. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Qin, B. ... Crystal structure of 2C helicase from enterovirus 71 Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1602573 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 27. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Zhang, C. ... Crystal structure of a soluble fragment of poliovirus 2CATPase PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007304 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment of TRIM7-expressing cells with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) crosslinker ( Nozawa et al., 2017 50. Nozawa, R.S. ∙ Boteva, L. ∙ Soares, D.C. ... SAF-A Regulates Interphase Chromosome Structure through Oligomerization with Chromatin-Associated RNAs Cell. 2017; 169 :1214-1227.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ) resulted in high-molecular-weight oligomeric species for both 2C-WT and 2C-T323A, but not 2C lacking the PBM (2CΔPBM), which is required for optimal interaction with TRIM7 ( Figure S5 A). Oligomerization was more pronounced for 2C-T323A than for 2C-WT. Similar results were obtained in an in vitro oligomerization assay using recombinant N-terminally truncated soluble regions of 2C-WT, 2C-T323A, and 2CΔPBM ( Figures S5 B and S5C). These results indicate that T323A does not abolish, and may even promote, the oligomerization of 2C protein. We next examined the ATPase activity of recombinant 2C-WT, 2C-T323A, and 2CΔPBM. In a dose response, time course, and substrate titration, we found that 2C-T323A is a more catalytically active ATPase than 2C-WT ( Figures 5 D–5F), suggesting that hyperactivity in this ATPase may disfavor optimal replication.
To correlate our biochemical findings with structural data, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the impact of T323A on CVB3 2C dimer behavior. Starting from the crystal structure of EV71 2C, we mutated all amino acid positions to convert to CVB3 2C, followed by energy minimization and pre-equilibration of dynamics for the dimer complex. MD simulations produced two dominant dynamic modes, which capture most (>60%) of the total dynamical variation and are also mutually orthogonal motions. The remaining 40% of the variation is distributed over 800 distinct non-negligible modes. The first mode is a “breathing” motion in which the monomers move away from each other, while the second is a “twisting” motion in which monomers rotate relative to each other ( Figure 5 G; Videos S1 and S2 ). Both of these motions are facilitated by a hinge region at residues S318–319, which was previously identified as a fulcrum based on multiple crystal structure configurations ( Guan et al., 2017 26. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Qin, B. ... Crystal structure of 2C helicase from enterovirus 71 Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1602573 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2C-WT has a dominant breathing mode (54.6% ± 3.5% amplitude), with minimal twisting (6.9% ± 1.4% amplitude). By contrast, 2C-T323A has an attenuated breathing mode (18.2% ± 2.9%), with dominant twisting (42.6% ± 2.5%). The same trend was observed in simulations of 2C in complex with the substrate ATP ( Figure S5 D). Two other mutations, T323G and T323S, resulted in decreased breathing and increased twisting at an intermediate level between WT and T323A ( Figure 5 H). Consistent with the observed increase in structural plasticity, CVB3-T323G and CVB3-T323S viruses were attenuated compared to CVB3-WT but still replicated to higher levels than CVB3-T323A ( Figure S5 E). Accordingly, both CVB3-T323G and CVB3-T323S viruses retained their sensitivity to TRIM7-mediated restriction ( Figure S5 F).

Although MD simulations cannot capture the quantum mechanical phenomenon of ATP hydrolysis, we can quantify configurational statistics of key residues required for hydrolysis when ATP is bound to the nucleotide pocket. Because ATP coordination is a rate-limiting step in hydrolysis, we can thereby infer the effect of the mutation on hydrolysis rate. The key residues are G132, G134, K135, S136, D176, D177, and N223 of one monomer and T196, R240, and R241 of the other ( Guan et al., 2017 26. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Qin, B. ... Crystal structure of 2C helicase from enterovirus 71 Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1602573 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 I). We used the radius of gyration of these residue sidechains as a metric of pocket tightness and hydrolysis-compatible coordination. By calculating the statistics of this metric over the course of the simulations, we quantified the extent of deformations in the overall shape of the pocket and inferred how tightly the ATP molecule (0.7 nm diffusion radius) coordinated with the hydrolysis residue. We found that the 2C-T323A mutant maintains a tight radius of gyration between 0.8 nm and 0.9 nm, while 2C-WT has much looser coordination centered on a 1.35-nm radius ( Figure 5 J).
Together, these data highlight an exquisite amino acid selectivity in 2C at residue 323. CVB3 can acquire a T→A mutation that confers resistance to TRIM7. The same 2C residue can tolerate T→S and T→G mutations but does not benefit from these modifications. In all cases, relative to WT, these mutations compromise normal replicative fitness in the absence of TRIM7, likely by altering optimal 2C function.
We next wanted to determine whether TRIM7 resistance affected viral replication and pathogenesis in a mouse model. We first evaluated the effects of mouse Trim7 (mTrim7) on CVB3 infection. RNAi-mediated knockdown of murine Trim7 resulted in increased susceptibility of C2C12 mouse myoblast cells ( Figures S6 A, S6B, and 6 ) and primary mouse cardiomyocytes ( Figure 6 B) to CVB3 infection. Conversely, ectopic expression of mTrim7 achieved similar levels of viral inhibition as human TRIM7 (hTRIM7) in HeLa cells ( Figure 6 C). We next used liver-targeted lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to assess the therapeutic potential of mTrim7 delivery ( Cheng et al., 2020 11. Cheng, Q. ∙ Wei, T. ∙ Farbiak, L. ... Selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles for tissue-specific mRNA delivery and CRISPR-Cas gene editing Nat. Nanotechnol. 2020; 15 :313-320 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar ). In cultured cells, LNPs-mTrim7 expression was detected by western blot and potently suppressed CVB3 infection as compared to LNPs-Fluc ( Figure S6 C). To study these effects in vivo , LNPs-mRNA were administered intravenously to C57BL/6J mice 6 h prior to intraperitoneal infection with CVB3 ( Cheng et al., 2018 10. Cheng, Q. ∙ Wei, T. ∙ Jia, Y. ... Dendrimer-Based Lipid Nanoparticles Deliver Therapeutic FAH mRNA to Normalize Liver Function and Extend Survival in a Mouse Model of Hepatorenal Tyrosinemia Type I Adv. Mater. 2018; 30 :e1805308 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Viral titers in liver were determined 48 h later, revealing that LNPs-mTrim7 conferred a nearly 100-fold reduction in CVB3 as compared to control LNPs-Fluc-treated mice ( Figure 6 D). Together, these data suggest that mTrim7 is important for controlling CVB3 in relevant murine cells and can limit CVB3 replication in vivo .
At the protein level, Trim7 is expressed highly in heart, kidney, and thigh muscle, while lower levels were observed in liver and pancreas, and Trim7 was nearly undetectable in spleen ( Figure 6 E). Since Trim7 levels are high in thigh muscle, we hypothesized that if mice were inoculated via intramuscular (i.m.) injection, CVB3-T323A might replicate better than CVB3-WT in muscle and disseminate more efficiently to other tissues. To test this, we used i.m. administration to infect C57BL/6J mice with CVB3-WT and CVB3-T323A (10 6 plaque-forming unit [PFU] per mouse) and assessed viral load in multiple tissues at 2 days post-infection. CVB3-T323A replicated to higher levels than CVB3-WT in all tested tissues ( Figure 6 F) and in serum ( Figure 6 G), with the largest difference in spleen. We next inoculated mice with 10 4 PFU virus via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, which targets the H3 strain of CVB3 efficiently to liver and spleen, and variable levels in heart, depending on dose and time point ( Althof et al., 2014 5. Althof, N. ∙ Harkins, S. ∙ Kemball, C.C. ... In vivo ablation of type I interferon receptor from cardiomyocytes delays coxsackieviral clearance and accelerates myocardial disease J. Virol. 2014; 88 :5087-5099 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kallewaard et al., 2009 35. Kallewaard, N.L. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Chen, J.W. ...

Kimura, T. ∙ Flynn, C.T. ∙ Alirezaei, M. ... Biphasic and cardiomyocyte-specific IFIT activity protects cardiomyocytes from enteroviral infection PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1007674 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robinson et al., 2017 59. Robinson, C.M. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Pfeiffer, J.K. Sex-Dependent Intestinal Replication of an Enteric Virus J. Virol. 2017; 91 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar ). We again observed higher titers of CVB3-T323A than CVB3-WT in all tissues tested ( Figure 6 H), with a marked 10,000-fold increase in the heart. These findings led us hypothesize that CVB3-T323A might have a competitive advantage over CVB3-WT at early time points. To test this, we performed an in vivo viral competition assay by administering both viruses together and determining whether either had a replicative advantage ( Figures S6 D–S6H). We observed that CVB3-T323A outcompeted CVB3-WT in liver and spleen. Thus, despite having decreased replicative fitness in normal cultured cells, CVB3-T323A has a fitness advantage in vivo .
We questioned whether the heightened replication of CVB3-T323A in vivo was due to the ability of this virus to evade triggering antiviral immune responses. Transcriptional profiling of RNA from infected thigh muscle and liver at 2 days post-infection revealed that CVB3-T323A activated immune responses (interferon, inflammation, and innate and adaptive immune pathways) more robustly than CVB3-WT ( Figure S6 I). CVB3-T323A induced higher levels of antiviral genes than CVB3-WT, including viral sensors ( Ddx58/Rig-I ; Ifih1/Mda5 ), transcription factors ( Irf7; Stat1 ), and ISGs (e.g., Ifit1 , Isg15 , and Oasl1 ) ( Figures S6 J and S6K). These data suggest that the high replication levels of CVB3-T323A in vivo is likely not due to impaired triggering of antiviral immune responses.
We next assessed pathogenic outcomes in mice infected with CVB3-WT and CVB3-T323A. Mice infected with CVB3-T323A rapidly lost weight starting from 3 days post-infection, and most mice succumbed to infection by day 10 ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Significant visceral fat necrosis was observed in CVB3-T323A-infected mice at 3 days post-infection ( Figure 7 C), and this outcome worsened by day 7 ( Figure 7 D). Visceral fat necrosis can result from enzymatic release from injured pancreatic cells ( Patel et al., 2015 55. Patel, K. ∙ Trivedi, R.N. ∙ Durgampudi, C. ... Lipolysis of visceral adipocyte triglyceride by pancreatic lipases converts mild acute pancreatitis to severe pancreatitis independent of necrosis and inflammation Am. J. Pathol. 2015; 185 :808-819 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since CVB3 can also replicate in the pancreas and cause pancreatic damage ( Mena et al., 2000 45. Mena, I. ∙ Fischer, C. ∙ Gebhard, J.R. ... Coxsackievirus infection of the pancreas: evaluation of receptor expression, pathogenesis, and immunopathology Virology. 2000; 271 :276-288 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tracy et al., 2000 74. Tracy, S. ∙ Höfling, K. ∙ Pirruccello, S. ... Group B coxsackievirus myocarditis and pancreatitis: connection between viral virulence phenotypes in mice J. Med. Virol. 2000; 62 :70-81 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined replication of CVB3-T323A in this organ. Indeed, the titer of CVB3-T323A in pancreas was approximately -800fold higher than CVB3-WT ( Figure 7 E). We also assessed kidney, liver, and pancreas damage by measuring blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine transaminase (ALT), amylase (AMYL), and lipase (LIPA) from serum. Compared to CVB3-WT, CVB3-T323A infection resulted in significantly elevated serum levels of BUN and ALT and trended toward a non-significant increase of AMYL and LIPA at 3 days post-infection ( Figure S7 A). By 7 days post-infection, serum ALT levels were similar in infected and uninfected mice. However, both AMYL and LIPA from CVB3-T323 trended toward a non-significant reduction relative to CVB-WT ( Figure S7 B).
Next, we evaluated the systemic immune responses by quantifying cytokine and chemokine production in serum during early infection (2 and 3 days post-infection). A broad panel of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were more highly induced by CVB3-T323A as compared to CVB3-WT ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Consistent with this, select chemokine mRNAs from pancreata were significantly elevated in CVB3-T323A-infected mice, as were genes involved in apoptosis including CD3, Sell, and Lcn2 ( Figure S7 E).
Finally, we used histology to characterize the pathologic damage of multiple organs, including thigh muscle, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, colon, ileum, and white and brown adipose tissue (3 and 7 days post-infection). Most organs (thigh muscle, liver, kidney, spleen, colon, ileum, and brown adipose) were normal when comparing PBS treatment to viral infection at 3 or 7 days (data not shown). At 3 days post-infection, hearts were normal in PBS-injected and infected mice, but on day 7, a greater proportion of CVB3-T323A-infected mice showed myocardial changes and inflammation in heart tissue ( Figure S7 F). At 3 days post-infection, the pancreas of CVB3-T323A infected mice exhibited irreversible injury in most acinar cells and an influx of inflammatory cells between the pancreatic lobules ( Figure 7 F). By contrast, the pancreas from mice infected with CVB3-WT had fewer injured acini. At 7 days post-infection, the pancreatic parenchyma showed significant inflammation, consisting of macrophages and lymphocytes, with marked acinar loss in CVB3-T323A-infected pancreas ( Figure 7 G). Notably, in all mice, CVB3 infection did not have apparent effects on the islets of Langerhans, as previously reported in BALB/c mice ( Vuorinen et al., 1989 76. Vuorinen, T. ∙ Kallajoki, M. ∙ Hyypiä, T. ... Coxsackievirus B3-induced acute pancreatitis: analysis of histopathological and viral parameters in a mouse model Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1989; 70 :395-403 PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with visible visceral fat necrosis ( Figures 7 C and 7D), histopathologic analysis of white adipose tissue revealed that CVB3-T323A caused more severe damage than CVB-WT, with large regions of necrotic adipocytes surrounded by inflammatory cells ( Figures 7 H and 7I). Thus, the marked lethality observed with CVB3-T323A is likely due primarily to a severe form of pancreatitis, consisting of high viral replication, exacerbated immunopathology, and irreversible pancreatic destruction.

Section: Discussion

Viruses are known to rely on or even hijack the ubiquitin-proteasome system to promote replication ( Calistri et al., 2014 8. Calistri, A. ∙ Munegato, D. ∙ Carli, I. ...

Gustin, J.K. ∙ Moses, A.V. ∙ Früh, K. ... Viral takeover of the host ubiquitin system Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2 :161 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a small but growing number of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, particularly E3 ligases, are emerging as important cell-intrinsic antiviral effectors ( Patil and Li, 2019 56. Patil, G. ∙ Li, S. Tripartite motif proteins: an emerging antiviral protein family Future Virol. 2019; 14 :107-122 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, TRIM79α and TRIM52 target flavivirus nonstructural proteins for degradation ( Fan et al., 2016 20. Fan, W. ∙ Wu, M. ∙ Qian, S. ...

TRIM22, TRIM41, TRIM14, and TRIM32 inhibit influenza A virus by degrading viral nucleoprotein (NP) or polymerase subunit 1 (PB1) ( Fu et al., 2015 22. Fu, B. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Ding, H. ...

TRIM33 and the non-TRIM E3 ligase C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) inhibit HIV-1 replication through degradation of the viral integrase and Tat, respectively ( Ali et al., 2019a 3. Ali, A. ∙ Farooqui, S.R. ∙ Banerjea, A.C. The host cell ubiquitin ligase protein CHIP is a potent suppressor of HIV-1 replication J. Biol.

Cellular TRIM33 restrains HIV-1 infection by targeting viral integrase for proteasomal degradation Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :926 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we discovered that human TRIM7 restricts multiple human enteroviruses ( Figure 1 ). TRIM7, also known as glycogenin-interacting protein (GNIP), belongs to a large family of proteins with similar structural domains, including a RING domain, B-box domain, coiled-coil domain, and PRY/SPRY domain ( Skurat et al., 2002 69. Skurat, A.V. ∙ Dietrich, A.D. ∙ Zhai, L. ... GNIP, a novel protein that binds and activates glycogenin, the self-glucosylating initiator of glycogen biosynthesis J. Biol.

Structure-function analysis of GNIP, the glycogenin-interacting protein Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421 :236-242 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). TRIM7 was previously shown to have both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing activities depending on the model system ( Chakraborty et al., 2015 9. Chakraborty, A. ∙ Diefenbacher, M.E. ∙ Mylona, A. ... The E3 ubiquitin ligase Trim7 mediates c-Jun/AP-1 activation by Ras signalling Nat.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM7 suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma progression by directly targeting Src protein Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27 :1819-1831 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) Mouse Trim7 was identified in a CRISPR screen as a host factor that inhibits murine norovirus replication ( Orchard et al., 2018 52. Orchard, R.C. ∙ Sullender, M.E. ∙ Dunlap, B.F. ... Identification of Antinorovirus Genes in Human Cells Using Genome-Wide CRISPR Activation Screening J. Virol. 2018; 93 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar ), suggesting a broader role in antiviral immunity. TRIM7 also negatively regulates antiviral responses by degrading STING ( Yang et al., 2020 79. Yang, B. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Cui, Y. ... RNF90 negatively regulates cellular antiviral responses by targeting MITA for degradation PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16 :e1008387 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) and has been identified as a host factor required for optimal flavivirus infection via ubiquitination of the viral envelope protein ( Giraldo et al., 2020 24. Giraldo, M.I. ∙ Xia, H. ∙ Aguilera-Aguirre, L. ... Envelope protein ubiquitination drives entry and pathogenesis of Zika virus Nature. 2020; 585 :414-419 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We found that TRIM7 restricts enteroviruses by impairing viral RNA replication. 2C and its precursor, 2BC, are the major viral proteins that interact with TRIM7. However, TRIM7 only mediates degradation of 2BC, but not 2C. Both 2C and 2BC proteins help remodel host membranes to form replication organelles. 2C also functions as an ATPase and RNA helicase and is critical for viral RNA replication ( Baggen et al., 2018 7. Baggen, J. ∙ Thibaut, H.J. ∙ Strating, J.R.P.M. ... The life cycle of non-polio enteroviruses and how to target it Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16 :368-381 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ; Laufman et al., 2019 39. Laufman, O. ∙ Perrino, J. ∙ Andino, R. Viral Generated Inter-Organelle Contacts Redirect Lipid Flux for Genome Replication Cell. 2019; 178 :275-289.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). The finding that TRIM7 specifically targets 2BC highlights a previously unappreciated vulnerability of this viral precursor to host restriction.
During virus-host conflicts, viruses use diverse strategies to counteract host restriction ( Duggal and Emerman, 2012 17. Duggal, N.K. ∙ Emerman, M. Evolutionary conflicts between viruses and restriction factors shape immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :687-695 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, HIV evades host restriction by expressing virally encoded antagonist proteins Vpx, Vif, and Vpu that degrade SAMHD1 ( Hrecka et al., 2011 30. Hrecka, K. ∙ Hao, C. ∙ Gierszewska, M. ... Vpx relieves inhibition of HIV-1 infection of macrophages mediated by the SAMHD1 protein Nature. 2011; 474 :658-661 Crossref Scopus (977) PubMed Google Scholar ; Laguette et al., 2011 38. Laguette, N. ∙ Sobhian, B. ∙ Casartelli, N. ... SAMHD1 is the dendritic- and myeloid-cell-specific HIV-1 restriction factor counteracted by Vpx Nature. 2011; 474 :654-657 Crossref Scopus (1207) PubMed Google Scholar ), APOBEC3 ( Marin et al., 2003 44. Marin, M. ∙ Rose, K.M. ∙ Kozak, S.L. ... HIV-1 Vif protein binds the editing enzyme APOBEC3G and induces its degradation Nat. Med. 2003; 9 :1398-1403 Crossref Scopus (701) PubMed Google Scholar ), and BST2 ( Neil et al., 2007 49. Neil, S.J.D. ∙ Sandrin, V. ∙ Sundquist, W.I. ... An interferon-α-induced tethering mechanism inhibits HIV-1 and Ebola virus particle release but is counteracted by the HIV-1 Vpu protein Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2 :193-203 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. In addition to encoding viral antagonists, viruses also can gain beneficial mutations in viral proteins targeted by restriction factors. For example, retroviruses can escape TRIM5-mediated restriction through viral capsid mutations ( Pacheco et al., 2010 53. Pacheco, B. ∙ Finzi, A. ∙ Stremlau, M. ... Adaptation of HIV-1 to cells expressing rhesus monkey TRIM5α Virology. 2010; 408 :204-212 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show that under selective pressure by TRIM7, a CVB3 variant with a mutation in 2C ATPase at position 323 rapidly emerges. While the T323A mutation benefits the virus with respect to TRIM7 evasion, the cost to the virus is reduced replication in normal cultured cells. MD simulations, which are increasingly being used to study virus-host interactions ( Sheik Amamuddy et al., 2020 67. Sheik Amamuddy, O. ∙ Verkhivker, G.M. ∙ Tastan Bishop, Ö. Impact of early pandemic stage mutations on molecular dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 MPro J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2020; 60 :5080-5102 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ode et al., 2012 51. Ode, H. ∙ Nakashima, M. ∙ Kitamura, S. ... Molecular dynamics simulation in virus research Front. Microbiol. 2012; 3 :258 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), show that the 2C-2C dimer complex undergoes two fundamental independent orthogonal motions supported by a hinge region in the proximity of the mutation site ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Mutations produce different effects in the relative amplitudes of these two essential motions. The most distinct change is T323A, which drastically reduces the dominant breathing motion and significantly enhances the twisting motion. This motion also correlates with the ability of 2C-T323A to escape from TRIM7 binding ( Figures 3 M and 3N). The breathing motion seems to be the main dynamic mode for normal viral replication, as the T323A mutation reduces breathing amplitude and impairs viral fitness ( Figures 5 A–5C). Additionally, the simulations also show that the residues involved in ATP hydrolysis are tightly coordinated in the 2C-T323A mutant and loosely coordinated in 2C-WT, providing a molecular explanation for the increased hydrolysis rate of 2C-T323A compared to 2C-WT ( Figure 5 F). Summarily, MD not only revealed the link between protein dynamics and TRIM7 evasion but also suggests that such dynamics are evolutionarily constrained due to other functional requirements of the protein.
In mice, Trim7 is expressed at variable levels in multiple tissues ( Figure 6 E). Delivery of Trim7 mRNA to liver via LNPs demonstrated proof-of-concept that Trim7 can suppress CVB3 in vivo ( Figure 6 D). Additionally, CVB3-T323 replicates to higher titers than CVB-WT in all tissues tested by either i.m. or i.p. administration ( Figures 6 F–6H, and 7 E). CVB3-T323A also has a competitive advantage over CVB3-WT in vivo ( Figure S7 ). We speculate that in mice, CVB3-T323A establishes a more productive replicative niche than CVB3-WT in Trim7-expressing tissues, such as muscle, leading to increased replication and dissemination to other tissues, such as liver, spleen, and pancreas.
The increased replicative potential of CVB3-T323A was associated with enhanced pathogenicity measured by extreme weight loss and an 84.6% mortality rate ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Notably, visceral fat necrosis was grossly evident in the peritoneum of CVB3-T323A-infected mice ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Histopathologic analysis of pancreas showed that CVB3-T323A infection caused acinar cell destruction and irreversible pancreatic damage ( Figures 7 F and 7G), which correlated with inflamed and necrotic white adipose tissue ( Figures 7 H and 7I). Uncontrolled replication of CVB3 in pancreas triggers a hyper-inflammatory immune response that results in the destruction of pancreatic exocrine tissue ( Huber and Ramsingh, 2004 32. Huber, S. ∙ Ramsingh, A.I. Review Coxsackievirus-Induced Pancreatitis. 2004; 17 :358-369 Google Scholar ; Tracy et al., 2000 74. Tracy, S. ∙ Höfling, K. ∙ Pirruccello, S. ... Group B coxsackievirus myocarditis and pancreatitis: connection between viral virulence phenotypes in mice J. Med. Virol. 2000; 62 :70-81 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we speculate that CVB3-T323A-induced pancreatitis drives the increased mortality rate. Indeed, we found that the 2C-T323A mutation enhances replication in pancreas by 800-fold ( Figure 7 E). We also found that CVB-T323A infection resulted in higher induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines ( Figures S7 C and S7D). These data indicate that the excessive inflammation and damage caused by CVB3-T323A appears to render an otherwise robust antiviral response ( Figures S6 J and S6K) insufficient to protect the mice from disease and death.
It is intriguing to speculate whether TRIM7 resistance can arise naturally if the virus encounters cells or tissues with high TRIM7 levels. We propose that enterovirus variants with 2C-T323 mutations are not favored in nature due to increased pathogenicity, which may preclude extended viral shedding and transmission to new hosts. Rather, this experimentally derived viral adaptation suggests that an evolutionary virus-host genetic conflict may exist between enteroviruses and mammalian TRIM7. Indeed, a naturally occurring valine at position 323 of 2C was identified in type B enteroviruses from non-human primates (EV-B112, EV-B113, and EV-B114/SA5) and cows (bovine enterovirus, BEV) ( Figure S3 B). Despite high sequence similarity to TRIM7-sensitive CVB3 and E11, one non-human primate enterovirus, SA5, was only modestly inhibited by TRIM7 ( Figure S3 C). In humans, only one 2C-T323I variant in a human clinical isolate of echovirus 18 has been reported ( Figure S3 E; Krumbholz et al., 2016 37. Krumbholz, A. ∙ Egerer, R. ∙ Braun, H. ... Analysis of an echovirus 18 outbreak in Thuringia, Germany: insights into the molecular epidemiology and evolution of several enterovirus species B members Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 2016; 205 :471-483 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). This I323 variant was less sensitive than E18-T323 to TRIM7-mediated inhibition in vitro ( Figures S3 F and S3G). Thus, evolutionary pressure may have contributed to a structurally plastic enterovirus 2C molecule that can adapt to gain a fitness advantage in the presence of TRIM7.
For the TRIM7 resistance mutation, we have characterized the impact of T323A on 2C dimerization and ATPase activity; however, we did not analyze whether the mutation affects 2C helicase activity. We also have not determined whether non-human enteroviruses with the T323V variation in 2C have altered susceptibility to their species-matched TRIM7 proteins and, more generally, whether position 323 in enterovirus 2C is a TRIM7-driven determinant in species susceptibility. In vivo , our study lacks specific insight into the relative contribution of virus-induced cell damage and host-induced immunopathology in the context of pancreatic cell destruction. We also have yet to determine the fitness cost to a host lacking Trim7, which is needed to fully appreciate the evolutionary principles governing the interaction between enteroviruses and this unique cell-intrinsic restriction factor.

5-week-old female wild-type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. 6 to 7-week-old mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups for virus infections. Animal studies were carried out in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities managed and maintained by the UTSW Animal Resource Center. Facilities were maintained at an acceptable range of 68–79°F at a humidity of 30%–70% on a 12 h dark/12 h light cycle. Mice were handled according to the Guide for the Care of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All mouse studies were performed at UT Southwestern (Animal Welfare Assurance no. a3472-01) after obtaining approval by the UTSW Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in a manner designed to minimize pain, and any animals that exhibited severe disease were euthanized immediately .
118 RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase pENTR clones ( Table S1 ) were obtained from N. Alto. These 118 E3 genes were subcloned into Lentivirus-based expression vector pTRIP.CMV.IVSb.ires.TagRFP-DEST ( Schoggins et al., 2011 63. Schoggins, J.W. ∙ Wilson, S.J. ∙ Panis, M. ... A diverse range of gene products are effectors of the type I interferon antiviral response Nature. 2011; 472 :481-485 Crossref Scopus (1844) PubMed Google Scholar ) or pSCRPSY-DEST ( Schoggins et al., 2012 64. Schoggins, J.W. ∙ Dorner, M. ∙ Feulner, M. ... Dengue reporter viruses reveal viral dynamics in interferon receptor-deficient mice and sensitivity to interferon effectors in vitro Proc. Natl. Acad.

To generate N-terminal HA-tagged gene expression constructs, the empty pTarget vector (Promega) was reengineered by inserting HA-tag coding sequence between BamHI and XhoI, and the new expression vector was named pTT-HA-C. All viral protein coding genes used in this study were subcloned into pTT-HA-C using XhoI and SacII. N-terminal StrepII-tagged wild-type and mutated ubiquitin (K48 only and K48R) were custom-synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. and cloned into pRK5-HA-ubiquitin-WT plasmid (Addgene #17608, a gift from Ted Dawson) using SalI and NotI. For protein expression and purification, TRIM7 PRY/SPRY domain was cloned into pGEX4T-1 vector (a gift from N. Alto) using EcoRI and XhoI. CVB3 N-terminal transmembrane region (1-115) deleted 2C (116-329) and its single mutation T323A and pocket-binding motif deletion were cloned into pHis-MBP-His vector (a gift from N. Alto) using BamHI and NotI using Gibson Assembly. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Lentiviral production and transduction was performed as previous described ( Schoggins et al., 2011 63. Schoggins, J.W. ∙ Wilson, S.J. ∙ Panis, M. ... A diverse range of gene products are effectors of the type I interferon antiviral response Nature. 2011; 472 :481-485 Crossref Scopus (1844) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 5 × 10 5 293T cells in 6-well plates or 1 × 10 5 cells in 24-well plates were co-transfected with plasmids expressing E3 (pTRIP-E3 or pSCRPSY-E3), HIV-1 gag–pol and VSV-G in a ratio of 1/0.8/0.2, respectively. For 6-well plate transfection, 6 μl X-tremeGENE HP (Roche) was combined with 2.0 μg total DNA in 100 μl Opti-MEM (GIBCO). For 24-well plate transfection, 1.5 μl FuGENE (Roche) was combined with 0.5 μg total DNA in 25 μl Opti-MEM. Transfections were carried out for 6 h, followed by a medium change to DMEM containing 3% FBS. Supernatants were collected at 48 h and 72 h, pooled, cleared by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. For lentiviral transduction, HeLa or Huh7.5 cells were seeded in to 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 10 4 cells per well and transduced with lentivirus by spinoculation at 1000 x g at 37°C for 45 min in medium containing 3% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 4 μg/mL polybrene.
For virus infection assay, then lentivirus transduced cells were split and reseeded in to 24-well plates 48 h post-transduction at a density of 4 × 10 4 cells per well. 16-24 h later, the cells were infected with the indicated reporter virus at low multiplicity of infection (MOI. 1 MOI = 1 plaque formation unit per cell). The cells were harvested for FACS-based infectivity analysis. The harvest time for each virus is: CVB3-GFP, 8 h, ONNV-GFP, 24 h, VEEV-GFP, 24 h, PIV3-GFP 24 h, Adv5-GFP at 12 h, YFV-venus and ZIKV-GFP at 48 h.
To generate a non-reporter wild-type infectious clone of CVB3 [strain Woodruff, also known as H3 strain], the total RNA from wild-type CVB3 infected cells was extracted. Subsequently, the cDNA was generated using SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Cat#18091050) to be template. Then, we used PCR to clone the full-length CVB3 genome using Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Cat#600675), and cloned it into pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Cat#K280002). This plasmid was named pCRII-T7-CVB3. The constructs were sequenced to verify the original sequence. The 2C mutated CVB3 used in this study was engineered by using overlap PCR to generate a fragment containing the mutation, then inserted into CVB3 infectious cDNA constructs using SpeI and PmlI.
For CVB3 replicon constructs, we modified pCVB3-eGFP infectious clone ( Feuer et al., 2002 21. Feuer, R. ∙ Mena, I. ∙ Pagarigan, R. ... Cell cycle status affects coxsackievirus replication, persistence, and reactivation in vitro J. Virol. 2002; 76 :4430-4440 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ) by inserting Rluc2A coding sequence using BstBI and NdeI restriction sites. The wild-type CVB3 replicon was termed pCVB3-Rluc2A-RepWT. To make a replication-deficient replicon, the codons of the GDD polymerase active site “ggt gac gat” in viral 3D gene were replaced with “acg cgt,” which encodes amino acids TR, and is recognized by restriction enzyme MluI. This plasmid was named pCVB3-RLuc2A-RepMut.
CVB3 viral RNA and replicon RNA were in vitro transcribed using T7 RiboMAX Express Large-Scale RNA Production System (Promega, Cat#P1320). RNA was purified from the transcription reaction using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Cat#74106) and quantified by Nanodrop.
The TransIT®-mRNA Transfection Kit (Mirus Bio, Cat#MIR2250) was used for the transfection of infectious viral RNA and replicon RNA. To produce virus from in vitro transcribed RNA, HeLa cells were seeded in a 100cm dish at a density of 4 × 10 6 cells the day before transfection. A total of 4 μg of viral RNA was transfected in each dish, and virus was harvested 36 to 48 h post-transfection. For CVB3 replicon assays, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 10 4 cells per well in 24-well plates the day before transfection. 100 ng viral replicon RNA was transfected into the cells. The transfected cells were harvested at the indicated time points using Renilla lysis buffer. Renilla luciferase activity was quantified using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Cat# E2820) and LUMIstar OPTIMA Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH).
Confocal microscopy analysis of binding and entry: cells were seeded in Falcon 8-well culture slide (Cat#354118) at a density of 5 × 10 3 cells per well the day before infection. The cells were infected with CVB3 at 1,000 MOI and adsorbed to cells for 1.5 h at 4°C with horizontal shaking. After adsorption, the cells were washed five times with cold FBS-free DMEM. For the binding assays, the cells were fixed using 4% PFA at the end of washing. For entry assays, the washed cells were incubated with pre-warmed medium containing 5% FBS at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were then immediately chilled on ice and washed with cold DMEM three times, followed by three washes each of cold glycine buffer (pH3.5) and cold DMEM. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA, PFA was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS three time at room temperature. Virus was visualized using anti-VP1 antibody staining according to the “Immunofluorescence assay and microscopy” procedure described below.
Plaque assay of binding and entry: cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells per well the day before infection. The cells were infected with CVB3 at 100 MOI and adsorbed to cells for 1.5 h at 4°C with horizontal shaking. The cells were processed as described in the preceding section. After the final wash, 200 μL FBS free DMEM was added into the wells, and the plates were placed in −80°C for 1h. After three freeze-thaw cycles, bound or internalized virus was quantified by plaque assay.
Total RNA from tissue culture cells was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Cat#74106) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from mouse tissue was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR assays, SuperScript IV First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Cat#18091050) was used to generate the complementary DNA template.
For CVB3 strand-specific real-time RT-PCR, CVB3-5′UTR-forward primer (UTJS19202) was used to synthesize viral minus strand RNA, and CVB3-3′UTR-reverse primer (UTJS19203) was used to synthesize viral plus strand RNA. CVB3 genomic RNA copies were determined by quantitative RT-PCR using primer pairs targeting viral RNA encoding the 3C protein. Plasmid pTT-HA-3C was used as standard template. The real-time PCR was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystem, Cat#4385612). All RT-qPCR reactions were performed using a 7500 FAST Real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are listed in Table S2 .
CVB3 was serially passaged in HeLa-TRIM7 cells or control cells expressing Fluc. Briefly, the cells were infected with CVB3 at 10 MOI, and the supernatants were harvested 12h post-infection. Then, 50% of the supernatant was used for the next round of infection. CPE was observed after the 4 th passage. Plaque purification was used to isolate single clonal variants. The full-length viral genomes of TRIM7-resistant CVB3 or control passaged CVB3 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector. Plasmid were sequenced using fourteen primers spanning the CVB3 full-length genome ( Table S2 ).
For CVB3 infections, after fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in 1x PBS containing 3% BSA at 4°C for 20 min and blocked in 1x PBS containing 3% BSA at RT for 1 h. Then the cells were incubated with VP1 primary antibody (EMD Millipore, Cat#MAB948, 1:1000) or anti-dsRNA antibody (J2, 1:1,000) in 1x PBS containing 1% BSA for 1h at RT. Cell were washed five time with PBS, incubated with 1:5,000 Alexa Fluor-488 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) in 1x PBS containing 1% BSA for 1h at room temperature in the dark, followed by five washes with PBS, and staining with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen, Cat#P36962).

Tissue culture cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated on ice for 30min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. For mouse tissue lysates, fresh tissues were collected in 2ml round-bottom Eppendorf tubes containing NP40 lysis buffer and cut to small pieces using scissors. Then the tissues were homogenized with a Bullet Blender homogenizer (Next Advanced Inc., Averill Park, NY), and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. Western blot analyses were performed as previously described ( Mar et al., 2018 43. Mar, K.B. ∙ Rinkenberger, N.R. ∙ Boys, I.N. ... LY6E mediates an evolutionarily conserved enhancement of virus infection by targeting a late entry step Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3603 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Coxsackievirus B3 proteins directionally complement each other to downregulate surface major histocompatibility complex class I J. Virol. 2007; 81 :6785-6797 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For Co-IP assays, plasmids expressing genes of interest were co-transfected into 293T cells in 6-well plate. The cells were harvested at 30 h post-transfection and lysed in 400 μL NP40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. After incubation on ice for 30min, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. Subsequently, a proportion of the cell lysate was saved for analysis as input, and another proportion was subjected to precipitation with anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce, Cat#88837) or Anti-Flag M2 affinity Gel (Sigma, Cat#A2220) overnight at 4°C with rocking. The next day, the beads or gel were washed seven times with IP wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) NP-40, 1 mM EDTA). Precipitated proteins were eluted from beads or gel by heating sample in SDS loading buffer at 75°C for 15 min.
For cell-based ubiquitination assays, plasmids expressing HA-2BC, StrepII-Ubi, and TRIM7-3F were co-transfected into 293T cells in 6-well plates. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μM) was added into culture medium at 24 h post-transfection, and the cells were harvested at 30 h post-transfection. The cell lysates were subjected to precipitation with HA-Beads or Strep-beads overnight at 4°C clod room. Precipitated proteins were eluted from beads or gel by heating samples in SDS loading buffer at 75°C for 15 min.
To identify TRIM7-interacting proteins, StrepII-3xFlag tandem affinity purification was performed as described ( Ma et al., 2017 42. Ma, Z. ∙ Fung, V. ∙ D’Orso, I. Tandem affinity purification of protein complexes from eukaryotic cells J. Vis. Exp. 2017; 119 :55236 Google Scholar ) with the following modifications. Briefly, HeLa-TRIM7 cells in two 150-cm dishes were infected with CVB3 at 25 MOI in the presence of MG132 for 6h. Total cell lysate (1.5 mL) was separated into two equal volumes and subjected to first affinity with anti-Flag or anti-IgG beads overnight at 4°C cold room with rolling. The next day, beads were washed seven times with IP wash buffer. The precipitated proteins were eluted using 3xFlag peptides (Sigma, Cat#F4799). The volume of eluted proteins was adjusted to 400 μL with IP wash buffer, then incubated with Strep-Tactin Beads (IBA, Cat#2-1206-002) for 4h at 4°C with rocking for a second affinity purification. After seven washes, the precipitated proteins were eluted with Strep-Tactin elution buffer (IBA, Cat#2-1000-025: 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 2.5 mM Desthiobiotin). To identify TRIM7 interacting proteins, the eluted proteins were separated on a gradient gel (BioRad, 4%–20% precast polyacrylamide gel) at 120V for 5∼10 min, until the protein ladder run ∼1cm into gel. Then the gel was stained with Coomassie blue for 1h at RT. After destaining of the gel, the stained area was cut into slices and each slice was placed into an Eppendorf 1.5 mL tube, which had been previously rinsed with 50% acetone and millipure water. Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry by the UT Southwestern Proteomics Core.
To knockdown endogenous TRIM7 expression in HepG2 cells, the cells were transduced with lentivirus-expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets TRIM7 or control LacZ gene. To knockdown endogenous Trim7 expression in C2C12 cells, the cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA that targets mouse Trim7 using lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Cat#13778030) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Non-targeting siRNA was used as control. The custom-synthesized shRNA sequences were ordered from Sigma, then cloned into pLKO.1 vector. The custom-synthesized siRNA duplexes were ordered from Sigma. All synthesized sequences are listed in Table S2 . Knockdown efficiency of endogenous TRIM7 expression was confirmed by western blot using an antibody against TRIM7.
For experiments to study interactions between TRIM7 and wild-type or mutated 2C, GST-tagged TRIM7 PRY/SPRY domain, His-MBP-His-tagged 2C 116-329 region and its mutants with T323A or pocket-binding motif deletion were expressed on E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. To express 2C proteins and a control protein His-MBP-His, the cells were grown at 37°C and induced overnight at 18°C with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 0.1 or 0.3 mM). To express GST-TRIM7-PRY/SPRY, the cells were grown at 37°C and induced overnight at 12°C with 0.3mM IPTG. Bacteria expressing 2C proteins were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 0.5 mMTCEP, and 1x EDTA-free protease inhibitor. The cells were disrupted using high pressure homogenization with Avestin Emulsiflex-C5 machine. The lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 9,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. Lysates were then incubated with nickel-charged and coupled with chelating ligand nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) affinity resin (Ni-NTA) (QIAGEN, Cat#30210) at 4°C for 2h with rocking. After multiple washes in wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole), proteins were eluted in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole. For GST-TRIM7PRY/SPRY purification, a similar strategy was employed, using Glutathione Sepharose® 4B (GE, 17-0756-05) for pull-down and 10 mM reduced glutathione (Fisher Scientific, Cat#BP2521-100), 1 mM DTT for elution.
20 μg of purified protein His-MBP-His, His-MBP-His-2CΔN.WT, His-MBP-His-2CΔN.T323A, and His-MBP-His-2CΔN.ΔPBM were preincubated with Ni-NTA magnetic beads (NEB, Cat#S1423S) in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP) in a total volume of 500 μL for 1h at room temperature. Beads were washed five times with wash buffer. Subsequently, 20 μg GST-TRIM7PRY/SPRY was resuspended in 500 μL binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA), and incubated with the pretreated Ni-NTA beads for 1h at room temperature. The bound proteins were eluted with 500 mM imidazole elution buffer. The eluted proteins were boiled in SDS loading buffer at 75°C for 15 min, then separated using SDS-PAGE gel, followed by staining with Coomassie blue.
The concentration of purified proteins was determined by the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat#23227) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 2C ATPase activity was performed using the QuantiChrom™ ATPase assay kit (BioAssay Systems, Cat#DATG-200) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
For isolation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs) from CVB3 infected cells, HeLa-TRIM7CA-3F cells were mock- infected or infected with 10 MOI CVB3. Cells were harvested 6 h post-infection by trypsinization, and collected by centrifugation at 4C, 1500 x g , for 5 min. The cells were then washed twice with 10 volumes of ice chilled 1x PBS, followed by two washes with 10 volumes of cold hypotonic buffer (50 mm HEPES pH7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose). Next, cell pellets were resuspended in 5 volume of hypotonic buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4C, 1500 x g for 5 min. Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing protease inhibitors and homogenized by dounce homogenizer to achieve at least 90% disruption. Post-nuclear supernatants (PNS) were isolated by centrifugation at 4C, 1500 x g for 10 min. Subsequently, the post-mitochondria supernatants (PMS) were isolated by centrifugation at 4C, 15,000 x g for 15 min. The protein concentration of PMS isolated from infected and mock-infected cells were determined using BCA assay. Equal amounts of protein in PMS fractions were adjusted to 3 mL using hypotonic buffer containing protease inhibitors. 3 mL of isotonic buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2) containing 60% sucrose was added, for a total of 6 mL of 30% sucrose solution. The 6 mL were overlaid in ultracentrifugation tubes with 2 mL of 18% sucrose in isotonic buffer, 2 mL of 10% sucrose in isotonic buffer and 2 mL of isotonic buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 h at 4C using SW40Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). 0.6 mL fractions containing lipid droplets were collected from the top and transferred to 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 mL of isotonic buffer. Fractions were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4C. A gel loading tip was used to remove the underlying solution until the sample volume was minimized to 50 μL. Samples were mixed with 1 volume of 2x SDS loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by western blot. For ER isolation, following LDs fractionation, the bottom pellets were resuspended in cold 1x PBS and collected by centrifugation at 4C, 15,000 x g for 10 min. Pellets were washed three times with cold PBS and dissolved in NP40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. The protein concentration of ER fraction was determined by BCA assay and equal protein amount was used for western blot analysis. Two independent isolation were performed for each experimental condition.
TRIM7-3F and HA-2BC were purified from 293T cells using anti-Flag beads and anti-HA beads, respectively. An in vitro ubiquitination assay on HA beads was performed by setting a 100 ul reaction containing the following components: 1x E3 ligase reaction buffer, 100um His-ubiquitin, 10mM MgATP solution, 100 nM E1, 1 μM E2, and 1 μM E3 TRIM7-3F. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 60 min. The HA-beads were washed five times with NP40 buffer containing 300 mM NaCl and 25 mM imidazole. Finally, the proteins were eluted by boiling with 1x SDS-PAGE buffer, and analyzed by western blot.
A dimer model of CVB3 was constructed using the crystal structure of EV71 (pdb id: 5gq1 ) ( Guan et al., 2017 26. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Qin, B. ... Crystal structure of 2C helicase from enterovirus 71 Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1602573 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Point mutations were performed on this EV71 structure to obtain the corresponding CVB3 WT and mutant dimer structures, by using COOT software ( Emsley et al., 2010 18. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). The two Zn ions (one for each monomer) were included and the missing residues were inserted with their most probable rotomeric forms. Then, dodecahedron simulation boxes were generated for each system imposing periodic boundary conditions, with the inclusions of SPCE explicit waters and neutralizing ions. AMBER99sb-ildn force-field ( Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010 41. Lindorff-Larsen, K. ∙ Piana, S. ∙ Palmo, K. ... Improved side-chain torsion potentials for the Amber ff99SB protein force field Proteins. 2010; 78 :1950-1958 Crossref Scopus (4387) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for all simulations. After an initial converged steepest descent energy minimization, 10 ns of NVT and 20 ns of NPT (first 10 with Berendsen [ Eslami et al., 2010 19. Eslami, H. ∙ Mojahedi, F. ∙ Moghadasi, J. Molecular dynamics simulation with weak coupling to heat and material baths J. Chem. Phys. 2010; 133 :084105 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ] and the last 10 with Parrinello-Rahman ( Parrinello and Rahman, 1981 54. Parrinello, M. ∙ Rahman, A. Polymorphic transitions in single crystals: A new molecular dynamics method J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 52 :7182 Crossref Scopus (14082) Google Scholar ) barostats) thermal equilibrations at T = 300 K and p = 1atm were performed. We employed 2 fs time steps in production level trajectories where simulations were run under NPT ensemble with Parrinello-Rahman barostat. Long-range electrostatics were handled with Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) ( Darden et al., 1993 14. Darden, T. ∙ York, D. ∙ Pedersen, L. Particle mesh Ewald: An N·log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98 :10089-10092 Crossref Scopus (23943) Google Scholar ) summation. All simulations were performed by Gromacs package ( Abraham et al., 2015 1. Abraham, M.J. ∙ Murtola, T. ∙ Schulz, R. ... Gromacs: High performance molecular simulations through multi-level parallelism from laptops to supercomputers SoftwareX. 2015; 1–2 :19 15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14546) Google Scholar ) on UTSW’s biohpc computing cluster.
We obtained 500 ns production level MD trajectory for each mutant. Two post-simulation analyses were carried out. First, the (mass-weighted) covariance matrix was calculated and diagonalized to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors, by fitting each MD frame to the initially equilibrated crystal structure. Then, principal component analyses were done by projecting the overall MD trajectory along each of the first 3 largest eigenvectors. This procedure to extract important dynamical information is also commonly known as “essential dynamics” ( Amadei et al., 1993 6. Amadei, A. ∙ Linssen, A.B.M. ∙ Berendsen, H.J.C. Essential dynamics of proteins Proteins. 1993; 17 :412-425 Crossref Scopus (2887) PubMed Google Scholar ; David and Jacobs, 2014 15. David, C.C. ∙ Jacobs, D.J. Principal component analysis: a method for determining the essential dynamics of proteins Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1084 :193-226 Crossref Scopus (700) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a second analysis, radius of gyration of the ATP binding pocket was calculated, and associated probability distributions were obtained. Here, the ATP binding residues from crystallographic structures were used to define the binding pocket (see Figure 3.c. of Guan et al., 2017 26. Guan, H. ∙ Tian, J. ∙ Qin, B. ... Crystal structure of 2C helicase from enterovirus 71 Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1602573 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Simulation convergences were assessed by calculating associated errors as the half of the difference between first and second halves of a given simulation.
Female C57BL/6J mice were inoculated by i.m. route with 1 × 10 6 PFU or i.p. 1 × 10 4 PFU of CVB3-WT or CVB3-T323A per mouse. Mice were sacrificed at 2-day post-infection, and thigh muscle (i.m. only), heart, liver, and spleen were harvested. Viral titers in pancrease were determined 3 days post-infection via i.m. route. To determine viral titers, fresh tissues were weighed and homogenized with a Bullet Blender homogenizer (Next Advanced Inc., Averill Park, NY), followed by plaque assay to quantitate viral genomes as described above.
To assess the antiviral activity of TRIM7 in vivo using lipid nanoparticle-delivered mRNAs, synthetic RNAs were purchased from Trilink Biotechnologies. This included the manufacturer’s “CleanCap Fluc mRNA” and a pseodouridylated, capped, and polyadenylated murine Trim7 RNA. mRNA delivery to the liver was achieved via Selective ORgan Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles (SORT LNPs) ( Cheng et al., 2020 11. Cheng, Q. ∙ Wei, T. ∙ Farbiak, L. ... Selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles for tissue-specific mRNA delivery and CRISPR-Cas gene editing Nat. Nanotechnol. 2020; 15 :313-320 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar ). Liver SORT LNPs consisted of five lipids with fixed 5A2-SC8:DOPE:cholesterol:DMG-PEG2000:DODAP ratio of 15:15:30:3:15.8 (molar), wherein 5A2-SC8 was synthesized as reported previously ( Zhou et al., 2016 81. Zhou, K. ∙ Nguyen, L.H. ∙ Miller, J.B. ... Modular degradable dendrimers enable small RNAs to extend survival in an aggressive liver cancer model Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :520-525 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Commercial lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), cholesterol, 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG2000) and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DODAP) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. To form LNPs-mRNA formulations, all required lipids were dissolved in ethanol and mRNA in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.0), followed by rapidly mixing the above two solutions at a volume ratio of 1:3 (ethanol to buffer) to reach the final weight ratio of 40:1 (total lipids to mRNA). After standing at room temperature 15 min, LNPs-mRNA formulations were dialyzed against 1XPBS for 2 h before intravenous injection into mice. Wild-type female mice were administrated 10 μg mRNA per mouse via intravenous injection (i.v.) to tail vein (n = 7 each group). At 6 h post i.v. administration, mice were challenged i.p. with CVB3 at 10 4 PFU per mouse. Livers were harvested at 2-day post infection. Virus loading in liver and spleen were determined by plaque assay. The expression and antiviral potential of mTrim7 from LNPs was independently confirmed in cell culture by delivering mRNA to HeLa cells, followed by western blot and a CVB3-GFP inhibition assay, as described above.
For in vivo growth-competition assay, female C57BL/6J mice were co-infected by i.m. and i.p. route with an equal amount of CVB3-WT and CVB3-T323A, for a total of 10 6 (i.m.) or 10 4 (i.p.) PFU virus. The liver and spleen were harvested at 2-day post-infection. Viral RNA was isolated and reverse transcription was performed using oligo-dT to generate cDNA template. Primer pairs forward-UTJS19019 and reverse-UTJS20101 ( Table S2 ) were used in a PCR reaction to amplify a 505 bp fragment that containing the T323A mutation site. Due to introduction of a BglI restriction site at the T323A mutation, BglI digestion was performed on the PCR products to distinguish the cDNA templates that came from CVB3-WT and CVB3-T323A. Only PCR products amplified from the CVB3-T323A, but not CVB3-WT could be cut, resulting in two fragments of 155 bp and 305 bp. To quantify the proportion of CVB3-WT and CVB3-T323A, the intensity reduction of the 505bp bands post BglI digestion was analyzed using ImageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2012 60. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intensity of individual 505 bp bands was measured, and the intensity scores were used to label peak images. To quantify the proportion of CVB3-WT and CVB3-T323A, the intensity reduction of the 505 bp bands post BglI digestion was analyzed using ImageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2012 60. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intensity of individual 505 bp bands were measured, and intensity scores inserted in peak images in Figure S6 E. The PCR products were also sequenced using sanger DNA sequencing to analyze the mixture of CVB3-WT and CVB3-T323A by analyzing the sequencing chromatogram.
Mouse primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from 2-day-old neonatal mice using Pierce primary cardiomyocyte isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog number #88281). The primary cardiomyocytes were transfected with mouse Trim7 specific targeting siRNA or non-targeting siRNA for 30 h, then infected with CVB3.
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine transaminase (ALT), amylase (AMYL), and lipase (LIPA) were measured in fresh, unfrozen serum using VITROS MicroSlide Technology by the UTSW Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Core. Muscle, heart, liver, pancreas, perigonadal white fat, and other mouse organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffer formalin, dehydrated, cleared, and infiltrated with paraffin. 5 μm paraffin sections were prepared from harvested organs and independently reviewed by a pair of blinded pathologists affiliated with UT Southwestern’s Animal Resource Center and UT Southwestern’s Histo Pathology Core.
Thigh muscle and liver were harvested at 2 d post-infection and pancreas was harvested at 3 d post-infection. The total tissue RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The concentration and quality of RNA samples were determined using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Gene expression profiling was performed with the nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString, Cat# 115000142, XT_PGX_MmV1_CancerImm_CSO) using the nCounter Analysis System (NanoString) per manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quantification, processing, and gene expression profiling were performed by the UTSW Microarray and Immune Phenotyping Core Facility. Gene expression data for all tissues was analyzed with nSolver 4.0 using the Advanced Analysis plugin, version 2.0 (NanoString), per manufacturer’s protocol. The background signal was calculated as the average of negative controls multiplied by 2 times the standard deviation of negative controls. The threshold background value was determined independently for each tissue by multiplying the maximum background signal by two. A frequency cutoff was applied with nSolver, such that genes with detection levels below a tissue-specific threshold background value in greater than 40% of samples (liver and muscle) or 70% of samples (pancreas) were automatically omitted from the dataset prior to gene set and differential expression analysis. Clustering of differentially expressed genes was performed with Morpheus (Broad Institute).
The profiling of mouse chemokines and inflammatory cytokines from serum samples were detected and quantified using Bio-Plex Mouse Chemokine Panel 31-Plex assay (Cat# 12009159). The assay was carried out by the UTSW Microarray and Immune Phenotyping Core Facility according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A single analysis was done for each mouse. In results presentation, a heatmap was generated using the average of log 2-fold change in concentration of each infected group of mice compared to PBS treated mice. Violin plots present the concentration of the indicated cytokines or chemokines (pg/mL).
All data were presented as means ± SD and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 8). Individual statistical tests are specified within the figure legends. For data with two groups, unpaired students’ t tests were used under the assumption of normality. Data with more than two groups were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) under assumption of normality. In general, at least three independent biological replicates (n) were carried out for each experiment. Data were reproduced in independent experiments as indicated in the legends.
