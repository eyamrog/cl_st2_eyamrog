Title: LetB Structure Reveals a Tunnel for Lipid Transport across the Bacterial Envelope


Abstract: Summary

Gram-negative bacteria are surrounded by an outer membrane composed of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide, which acts as a barrier and contributes to antibiotic resistance. The systems that mediate phospholipid trafficking across the periplasm, such as MCE (Mammalian Cell Entry) transporters, have not been well characterized. Our ~3.5 Å cryo-EM structure of the E. coli MCE protein LetB reveals an ~0.6 megadalton complex that consists of seven stacked rings, with a central hydrophobic tunnel sufficiently long to span the periplasm. Lipids bind inside the tunnel, suggesting that it functions as a pathway for lipid transport. Cryo-EM structures in the open and closed states reveal a dynamic tunnel lining, with implications for gating or substrate translocation. Our results support a model in which LetB establishes a physical link between the two membranes and creates a hydrophobic pathway for the translocation of lipids across the periplasm.

Section: Introduction

The bacterial outer membrane (OM) constitutes a formidable barrier that protects the cell against antibiotics and other harsh environmental stresses. Understanding the machinery involved in building and maintaining the OM is critical for the development of new antimicrobials targeting these fundamental, conserved pathways. In Gram-negative bacteria, the OM is an asymmetric lipid bilayer, with a phospholipid inner leaflet and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer leaflet, and this asymmetry is critical for its barrier function. To generate this barrier, membrane lipids, which are poorly soluble in water, must be transported across the hydrophilic periplasmic space between the inner membrane (IM) and OM.
Protein-based macromolecular machines have evolved unique architectures and mechanisms to transport hydrophobic molecules across aqueous spaces, such as efflux pumps and lipid/lipoprotein transporters ( Konovalova and Silhavy, 2015; Okuda et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2019 33.

A series of studies have unraveled how the E. coli LPS transport system employs an ABC transporter in the IM to drive movement of LPS molecules across a periplasmic bridge to an OM complex that mediates their insertion into the outer leaflet ( Li et al., 2019; May et al., 2015; Owens et al., 2019; Ruiz et al., 2009; Sherman et al., 2018 35.

Of these, the Mla system is the best characterized and has been implicated in the Maintenance of OM Lipid Asymmetry in E. coli ( Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009; Powers and Trent, 2018 38.

In contrast to the periplasmic bridge used for LPS transport, the Mla system consists of a soluble periplasmic protein (MlaC) that ferries lipids between an ABC transporter complex in the IM (MlaFEDB) and a protein complex in the OM (MlaA-OmpF/C) ( Abellón-Ruiz et al., 2017; Ekiert et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018; Kamischke et al., 2019; Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009; Thong et al., 2016; Chong et al., 2015 1.

In the MlaFEDB complex, the MCE subunit, MlaD, forms a homohexameric ring on the periplasmic side of the IM, through which a hydrophobic tunnel was proposed to form part of the lipid translocation pathway ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, other E. coli MCE genes, such as pqiB are much larger than mlaD and encode proteins with multiple MCE domains that can create much longer architectures ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). MCE transport systems are ubiquitous in double-membraned bacteria and chloroplasts ( Casali and Riley, 2007; Isom et al., 2017 9. Casali, N. ∙ Riley, L.W.

Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of one of the largest MCE proteins identified to date, a protein from E. coli that we name LetB for Lipophilic Envelope-spanning Tunnel B (formerly YebT; homologous to MAM-7 from Vibrio parahaemolyticus ; Krachler et al., 2011 34. Krachler, A.M. ∙ Ham, H. ∙ Orth, K. Outer membrane adhesion factor multivalent adhesion molecule 7 initiates host cell binding during infection by gram-negative pathogens Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :11614-11619 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that LetB forms a dynamic tunnel sufficiently long to mediate lipid transport directly between the IM and OM without the need for a shuttle protein. Thus, like LPS, phospholipids may also be transported across the periplasm by large transenvelope complexes.

Section: Results

LetB from E. coli is a large MCE gene encoded in an operon together with letA (formerly yebS ), an integral IM protein ( Figure 1 A). E. coli and Salmonella strains lacking letAB exhibit phenotypes consistent with OM defects ( Isom et al., 2018, 2017 25. Isom, G.L. ∙ Davies, N.J. ∙ Chong, Z.-S. ... MCE domain proteins: conserved inner membrane lipid-binding proteins required for outer membrane homeostasis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8608 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Isom, G. ∙ Rooke, J. ∙ Antunes, C. ... Mammalian Cell Entry domains are required for bile resistance and virulence in Salmonella bioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) ( Figures S1 A–S1C). LetB encodes seven MCE domains in a single polypeptide chain (MCE1–MCE7), with an N-terminal transmembrane helix that anchors LetB to the IM and is required for its function ( Figure S1 D). Our previous low-resolution negative-stain EM data showed that LetB resembles an elongated, segmented rod ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). To gain an understanding of how LetB may function to modulate OM integrity, we used cryo-EM to determine a high-resolution structure of LetB (residues 43–877, Figure 1 A). We collected data on a Krios microscope equipped with a K2 camera ( Table S1 ), which we processed in Relion ( Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2017 19. Fernandez-Leiro, R. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. A pipeline approach to single-particle processing in RELION Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2017; 73 :496-502 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2D class averages clearly show the overall arrangement of LetB, which is an elongated, hollow, hexameric structure with seven layers ( Figure 1 B). Extensive 3D classification, signal subtraction, and refinement schemes yielded a final set of 8 maps covering various subvolumes ( Figures S1 E, S1F, and S2 ). The resolution of these maps ranged from ~3–4 Å, allowing us to build a complete structural model of LetB ( Table S1 ; Figure S1 G). After our preprint corresponding to this paper was published ( Isom et al., 2019 27. Isom, G. ∙ Coudray, N. ∙ MacRae, M.R. ... Structure of LetB Reveals a Tunnel for Lipid Transport Across the Bacterial Envelope bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), another structure of LetB (YebT) was reported, with a similar overall architecture ( Liu et al., 2020 36. Liu, C. ∙ Ma, J. ∙ Wang, J. ... Cryo-EM Structure of a Bacterial Lipid Transporter YebT J. Mol. Biol. 2020; 432 :1008-1019 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The sequences of the seven MCE domains in LetB differ considerably, with sequence identity ranging from 17% to 28% in pairwise comparisons, and the domains of LetB are also highly diverged from the other E. coli MCE proteins, MlaD and PqiB ( Data S1 ; Table S2 ). However, each MCE domain has a structurally conserved core, consisting of a seven-stranded β-barrel ( Figures 1 C and 1D), similar to the MCE domains of PqiB and MlaD ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we identify two main regions that are variable between the structures of MCE domains ( Figure 1 E). The first variable region is the β6-β7 loop on the exterior surface of the β-barrel, which ranges from 9 to 15 residues in length and in which only MCE5 contains a helix. The second variable region is the β5-β6 loop, which ranges from 17 to 27 residues, with an average length of 20 residues in LetB and consists of a β-hairpin followed by a short ~two-turn helix.
The seven MCE domains of a single protomer of LetB resemble seven beads on a string ( Figure 1 F), with the order of the domains in the primary sequence determining the order of MCE “beads” on the string. The seven MCE domains are stacked almost directly on top of one another, and each domain is connected to the next by a short helical linker. Six copies of this linearly configured LetB protomer associate laterally to form a homohexameric assembly ( Figure 1 G). In the assembly, each MCE domain associates with the five other equivalent MCE domains from adjacent protomers to form a ring. The seven MCE domains lead to a final assembly of seven distinct rings, with a ring of MCE1 domains at the N terminus and the MCE7 ring at the C terminus ( Figure 2 A). These seven MCE rings that make up LetB stack to form an elongated macromolecular barrel with each protomer extending the entire length of the barrel. The N-terminal transmembrane helix of each protomer is expected to be anchored in the IM, as previously reported ( Isom et al., 2017 25. Isom, G.L. ∙ Davies, N.J. ∙ Chong, Z.-S. ... MCE domain proteins: conserved inner membrane lipid-binding proteins required for outer membrane homeostasis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8608 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the MCE1 ring abutting the IM and the MCE7 ring closest to the OM.
A continuous central tunnel runs through LetB, which is largely hydrophobic ( Figure 2 B), similar to that of the other two E. coli MCE proteins, PqiB and MlaD ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Though evolutionarily unrelated, the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC forms a similarly elongated assembly in the periplasm and uses proton motive force to transport substrates through its central tunnel out of the cell ( Figure S3 A). The average diameter of the LetB tunnel is ~14 Å, narrower than the tunnel running through AcrAB-TolC but large enough for the passage of lipids and other small molecules. While, in AcrAB-TolC, the tunnel is formed via the tight association of helices to form a rigid barrel; in LetB, the tunnel is largely formed by the conformationally dynamic β5-β6 loops that emerge from each MCE domain, which we term pore-lining loops (PLLs) ( Figures 2 C and 2D). The length of LetB is ~220 Å, comparable to the width of the periplasmic space ( Cohen et al., 2017; Graham et al., 1991; Matias et al., 2003; Semeraro et al., 2017 13.

In situ structure and assembly of the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2635 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). In summary, LetB is poised to serve as a tunnel for the transport of small molecules between the IM and OM by creating a bridge across the periplasm, perhaps via interactions with LetA in the IM and proteins or lipids in the OM.
The structure of LetB implies that MCE domains function as ring-shaped modular building blocks. This led us to hypothesize that, in multi-domain MCE proteins, the number of MCE domains in the primary sequence specifies the number of rings stacked in the final assembly. Indeed, the primary sequences of E. coli MlaD, PqiB, and LetB consist of one, three, and seven tandem MCE domains, respectively, and structures of these three proteins revealed that they consist of one, three, and seven stacked rings ( Figure 3 A). To further test this hypothesis, we selected MCE proteins from other bacterial species that were predicted to contain four, five, six, or eight MCE domains ( Isom et al., 2017 25. Isom, G.L. ∙ Davies, N.J. ∙ Chong, Z.-S. ... MCE domain proteins: conserved inner membrane lipid-binding proteins required for outer membrane homeostasis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8608 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) and visualized them by negative-stain EM. 2D class averages for the proteins containing four, five, and six tandem MCE domains clearly revealed multiple layers of density, consistent with barrel structures assembled from four, five, and six stacked rings, respectively ( Figures 3 B and S4 A–S4C). The eight domain MCE protein was less stable, often resulting in smaller, likely monomeric, particles; when oligomers were formed, these contained eight stacked rings ( Figures 3 B and S4 A–S4C). 2D class averages of the top view of all proteins revealed that they are approximately 6-fold symmetric like LetB and other MCE proteins, suggesting that they also assemble to form homo-hexamers ( Figure S4 A). Overall, these data indicate that MCE domains are modular building blocks of larger proteins, with each domain in the primary sequence specifying one ring in the resulting structure. From the 2D classes of these proteins and our structures of MlaD (1 ring), PqiB (3 rings), and LetB (7 rings), we estimated the lengths of the one, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight ring MCE barrels to be ~25, ~95, ~140, ~165, ~190, ~220, and ~260 Å, respectively. Thus, naturally occurring MCE proteins have evolved to form barrels with a range of lengths, perhaps in part to adapt to differences in the mean periplasmic width in different species and to accommodate larger or smaller interacting complexes in the IM or OM.
Given that the length of MCE proteins varies with the number of MCE domains, and the length of LetB is approximately the same as the reported width of the periplasm in E. coli ( Cohen et al., 2017; Graham et al., 1991; Matias et al., 2003; Semeraro et al., 2017 13.

In vivo analysis of the Escherichia coli ultrastructure by small-angle scattering IUCrJ. 2017; 4 :751-757 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that LetB may physically bridge the gap between the IM and OM, creating a continuous path for lipid transport. If this model is correct, then the length of LetB would be important for its function. To test this hypothesis, we engineered shorter mutant forms of LetB, which contained two, three, four, five, or six MCE domains instead of seven, as in the wild-type protein ( Figure 3 C; see STAR Methods for rationale of mutant design). To assess whether these engineered mutants were folded and assembled into shorter barrels of the expected size, we overexpressed and purified each mutant and imaged the proteins by negative-stain EM. 2D classification revealed that all of the LetB truncation mutants folded and homo-hexamerized to form the expected number of rings ( Figures 3 D, S4 D, and S4E).
To assay the function of these shorter LetB variants, we took advantage of a genetic interaction between pqiAB and letAB mutants. Disruption of pqiAB results in a moderate growth defect in the presence of the detergent lauryl sulfobetaine (LSB), while the growth of a letAB mutant is unaffected ( Isom et al., 2017 25. Isom, G.L. ∙ Davies, N.J. ∙ Chong, Z.-S. ... MCE domain proteins: conserved inner membrane lipid-binding proteins required for outer membrane homeostasis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8608 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, disruption of letAB in combination with pqiAB ( pqiAB letAB double knockout) significantly exacerbates LSB sensitivity, and complementation with wild-type letAB from a plasmid relieves this exacerbation, as previously described ( Isom et al., 2017 25. Isom, G.L. ∙ Davies, N.J. ∙ Chong, Z.-S. ... MCE domain proteins: conserved inner membrane lipid-binding proteins required for outer membrane homeostasis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8608 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 C). We used this complementation assay to assess whether or not the shorter LetB variants in a plasmid can also relieve the exacerbated phenotype of the pqiAB letAB double knockout. In the presence of LSB, LetB mutants that were five and six rings in length restored growth of the pqiAB letAB knockout to levels comparable or even greater than WT LetB, indicating that a five or six-ring form of LetB is functional ( Figure 3 E). In contrast, LetB variants that are four, three, and two rings in length were unable to restore growth of the pqiAB letAB knockout in the presence of LSB ( Figure 3 E). This indicates that these proteins are non-functional, despite being stable and properly folded in vitro ( Figures 3 D, S4 D, and S4E). As the four-ring mutant was the longest variant of LetB unable to restore growth in our complementation assay, we tested two other four-ring mutants containing rings 1-2-3-7 and 1-3-4-7. The 1-2-3-7 mutant folded poorly as assessed by negative-stain EM, while the 1-3-4-7 mutant folded and assembled into hexamers. Both the 1-2-3-7 and 1-3-4-7 mutants did not restore growth in the complementation assay ( Figure S4 G). Together, the data for all four-ring mutants (1-5-6-7, 1-2-3-7, and 1-3-4-7) support a model in which variants shorter than 5 rings in length do not function in cells. These results are consistent with the idea that the length of LetB may be one important factor for its function, possibly reflecting a minimum length required to bridge the distance between the IM and OM.
Our cryo-EM density map showed that the local resolution varied considerably between different regions of LetB: higher in the vicinity of rings 2–4, which are well ordered, and lower in the vicinity of rings 1, 5, 6, and 7 ( Figures 4 A and S1 E). One possibility was that conformational heterogeneity was leading to lower resolution. To tease apart different conformations, we explored multi-body refinement ( Nakane et al., 2018 47. Nakane, T. ∙ Kimanius, D. ∙ Lindahl, E. ... Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION eLife. 2018; 7 :e36861 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 3D variability analysis ( Punjani et al., 2017 53.

Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3661) PubMed Google Scholar ), which showed the flexibility of the overall structure ( Video S1 ). Using several masking and signal subtraction strategies ( Figure S2 ), we identified 8 classes ranging from 2.96 to 3.78 Å resolution, capturing the conformational dynamics of the sample. Rings 1, 5, 6, and 7 show multiple discrete conformational states, while rings 2, 3, and 4 are relatively rigid and are resolved in one conformation ( Figures 4 B, S1 E, and S2 ; Video S2 ). We focus our analysis here on the two most distinct conformational states, in which the central tunnel is either open or closed.

Morph between the Open and Closed States of LetB, Related to Figure 4 These models are generated from composite open and closed maps.
The configuration of the open and closed states is controlled primarily by two factors. First, the individual MCE domains from rings 1, 5, 6, and 7 undergo pivoting motions about axes through each MCE domain ( Figure 4 C). Second, the PLLs of rings 1, 5, 6 and 7 shift, resulting in dilation and constriction of the corresponding pores, resembling the opening and closing of a camera diaphragm ( Figure 4 D). The PLLs exhibit an additional layer of flexibility: within a given state (closed or open) the PLLs can likely adopt different conformations, as evidenced by additional loop-like densities in PLLs 5 and 7 ( Figure S5 A). Consistent with the observation that PLLs are flexible, a crystal structure we determined of the monomeric MCE2–MCE3 domains (residues 159–383) at 2.15 Å resolution ( Table S3 ) also revealed flexibility in the PLLs. The PLL is entirely disordered in MCE2 and adopts a significantly different conformation in MCE3 ( Figures S5 B–S5F), while the core MCE domains from the crystal structure are in good agreement with the EM structure. Our data suggest that, while the tunnel may have a propensity to be in a more closed or more open conformation, which we were able to separate as discrete conformations, the PLLs are fluid in nature regardless of the overall conformation of the tunnel. These loop dynamics may facilitate the movement of molecules through the tunnel and provide some plasticity to allow substrates of differing sizes to be accommodated. Substrates may include the diacyl phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), larger phospholipids such as cardiolipin, or perhaps other substrates yet to be identified. Interestingly, re-analyzing our published cryo-EM dataset of MCE protein PqiB ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB 5UVN ), with newer versions of Relion ( Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2017 19. Fernandez-Leiro, R. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. A pipeline approach to single-particle processing in RELION Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2017; 73 :496-502 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed similar conformational changes in this smaller, three-ring barrel ( Video S3 ; Figure S3 B), which result in modulation of the central pore diameter, as observed for LetB ( Figure 4 E).

Morph between the Open and Closed States of PqiB, Related to Figure 4
The opening and closing of the central pore through each MCE ring could also play a role in tunnel gating and translocation of substrates. Atomic-level conformational changes are known to be important for substrate translocation in several systems such as AcrAB-TolC and the LPS transporter. Opening and closing of the periplasmic tunnel in AcrAB-TolC has been observed ( Du et al., 2014 16. Du, D. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ James, N.R. ... Structure of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump Nature. 2014; 509 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ) and has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of transport activity. Similarly, conformational changes in a periplasmic component of the LPS transporter have been implicated in modulating substrate transport ( Owens et al., 2019 50. Owens, T.W. ∙ Taylor, R.J. ∙ Pahil, K.S. ... Structural basis of unidirectional export of lipopolysaccharide to the cell surface Nature. 2019; 567 :550-553 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). The conformational states we observe here may analogously play a role in the transport function of LetB. In E. coli , PE and PG constitute the bulk of the phospholipids in the OM ( Dowhan, 1997; Gidden et al., 2009 15. Dowhan, W. Molecular basis for membrane phospholipid diversity: why are there so many lipids? Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66 :199-232 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar 20. Gidden, J. ∙ Denson, J. ∙ Liyanage, R. ... Lipid Compositions in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis During Growth as Determined by MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometry Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2009; 283 :178-184 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we have previously shown that LetB binds both PE and PG ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the open state, the LetB tunnel is sufficiently wide to allow the passage of PE or PG from ring 1 to ring 6 (diameter of lipids ~9 Å assuming a surface area of at most ~62.8 Å, [ Murzyn et al., 2005 45. Murzyn, K. ∙ Róg, T. ∙ Pasenkiewicz-Gierula, M. Phosphatidylethanolamine-phosphatidylglycerol bilayer as a model of the inner bacterial membrane Biophys. J. 2005; 88 :1091-1103 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ]) ( Figure 4 E). Docking these lipids into the pore of ring 6 reveals that in the open state these lipids are easily accommodated, while in the closed state their passage is restricted ( Figure 4 F). The pore of ring 7 is narrower in both the closed and open states and may restrict the flux of lipids to or from the OM. The density is weak for the tips of PLL7, where the tunnel is narrowest in ring 7, suggesting that these loops are very flexible and loop dynamics may facilitate lipid passage through the constriction. Conformational dynamics may additionally be modulated by binding partners such as LetA, or other subunits yet to be identified.
Since each PLL contributes to the formation of a dynamic, hydrophobic tunnel ( Figure 2 B), we hypothesized that these loops may be essential for LetB function. To test this, we generated LetB PLL deletion mutants in which the β-hairpin motif of each PLL was deleted ( Figure 5 A). To determine whether these mutants were functional in a cellular context, we assessed whether these mutants could relieve the exacerbated phenotype of a pqiAB letAB double mutant in the presence of LSB, using the assay described above. None of the LetB PLL mutants restored growth in the presence of LSB ( Figure 5 B). While expression of all of the mutants could be detected in the cell ( Figure S6 B), negative-stain EM revealed that only the ΔPLL2 and ΔPLL3 mutants form stable hexameric structures similar to the WT protein ( Figure 5 C), while the other mutants appeared to be destabilized to some degree, as they assembled into hexameric structures at a lower frequency, or not at all ( Figures S7 A–S7C). Strikingly, 2D class averages of both ΔPLL2 and ΔPLL3 show a loss of density where the corresponding PLLs were deleted ( Figure 5 C), indicating that there is a gap in the wall of the tunnel.
Since our results show that ΔPLL2 and ΔPLL3 are folded yet functionally impaired, we asked whether specific amino acid residues within PLL2 and PLL3 may play important roles in LetB function. An analysis of PLL sequences showed that each PLL contains a conserved hydrophobic motif, ΦxxΦΦ (Φ denotes a hydrophobic residue; x denotes any residue), which faces the tunnel interior. A similar hydrophobic motif is also observed in the MCE protein MlaD and is important for function ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether these residues also play a functional role in LetB, we generated six point mutants: L243N, L246N, and V247N in PLL2 and L355N, L358N, and L359N in PLL3 ( Figure 5 D). Our complementation assay showed that none of these mutants are able to relieve the exacerbated phenotype of a pqiAB letAB double mutant in the presence of LSB ( Figure 5 E), suggesting that each point mutation in the hydrophobic motif of PLL2 or PLL3 is sufficient to disrupt LetB function. Negative-stain EM analysis of recombinantly produced mutants shows that each mutant is well folded and assembled into a hexameric structure similar to the wild type ( Figures 5 F, S7 D, and S7E), suggesting that the observed phenotypes likely correspond to a loss of function and not destabilization of the proteins. Together, our results suggest that the intact hydrophobic tunnel lining formed by the PLLs is important for LetB function.
Our data point to a model in which LetB transports substrates between the IM and OM through a central tunnel. Previous work has demonstrated that both LetB and its homologs are phospholipid-binding proteins ( Awai et al., 2006; Ekiert et al., 2017; Krachler et al., 2011; Thong et al., 2016 3. Awai, K. ∙ Xu, C. ∙ Tamot, B. ... A phosphatidic acid-binding protein of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane involved in lipid trafficking Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Krachler, A.M. ∙ Ham, H. ∙ Orth, K. Outer membrane adhesion factor multivalent adhesion molecule 7 initiates host cell binding during infection by gram-negative pathogens Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :11614-11619 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Thong, S. ∙ Ercan, B. ∙ Torta, F. ... Defining key roles for auxiliary proteins in an ABC transporter that maintains bacterial outer membrane lipid asymmetry eLife. 2016; 5 Published online August 16, 2016 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is unknown precisely where phospholipids or other substrates interact with LetB, and whether the interior of the tunnel is indeed part of the transport pathway. To assess whether potential substrates such as phospholipids are present in the tunnel, we developed a crosslinking-based approach to identify the locations of substrate-binding sites within LetB. To avoid detection of phospholipids non-specifically bound to the transmembrane regions, we used a soluble LetB construct with the TM helix deleted. We site-specifically incorporated the unnatural photocrosslinking amino acid p -benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (BPA) at multiple locations within LetB using amber stop codon suppression and an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA system in E. coli ( Chin et al., 2002 12. Chin, J.W. ∙ Martin, A.B. ∙ King, D.S. ... Addition of a photocrosslinking amino acid to the genetic code of Escherichiacoli Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :11020-11024 Crossref Scopus (558) PubMed Google Scholar ). UV irradiation of the sample leads to crosslinking of BPA to C-H bonds of potential substrates nearby. To facilitate detection of these crosslinked adducts, E. coli cultures were grown in the presence of 32 P orthophosphate, leading to labeling of bulk phospholipids and other phosphate-containing molecules. Thus, crosslinking-dependent 32 P association with LetB would be consistent with phospholipids being in close proximity to the site of BPA incorporation. As BPA is a bulky amino acid that is somewhat larger than tryptophan, we targeted all of the sites in the tunnel that presented bulky side chains facing the lumen for individual replacements with BPA (F468, W476, Y814, F818, and F833) ( Figure 6 A). In parallel, we designed mutations on the exterior, periplasm-facing surface of LetB where we hypothesized that phospholipids would not be present (K488 and E854) ( Figure 6 A).
After crosslinking in E. coli lysates, we purified the LetB protein by affinity chromatography, separated samples by SDS-PAGE, and detected LetB protein and associated phospholipids by Coomassie staining and a phosphorimager, respectively. Strong 32 P association with LetB was detected at all five sites of BPA incorporation inside the tunnel ( Figures 6 B and S7 F), while minimal 32 P association was detected at locations on the exterior surface of the tunnel. Thus, phospholipids or other 32 P containing substrates are specifically present inside the LetB tunnel.

Section: Discussion

Our data support a model wherein LetB serves as a tunnel to mediate lipid transport ( Figure 7 ), providing a shielded environment for hydrophobic lipids to traverse the hydrophilic periplasm and the peptidoglycan ( Figure S3 C). LetB is sufficiently long to span the gap between the inner and OMs and may physically interact with lipids and/or proteins in both membranes simultaneously. Consequently, the hydrophobic tunnel running the length of LetB may create a continuous pathway between the lipid environments of the IM and OM. To facilitate lipid insertion and extraction from membranes, it is likely that protein complexes in the IM and OM will also play a role. Indeed, the integral membrane protein LetA, which is encoded in the same operon as LetB, is a candidate to fulfill this role in the IM, while the existence of an OM complex remains hypothetical at this point.
This tripartite organization (IM, periplasmic, and OM subunits) is a common feature of many transenvelope transport systems, where complexes in the IM and OM mediate the movement of substrates in, out, or across the membranes, while the periplasmic components facilitate transport in between. While in LetB, a single polypeptide is capable of spanning the periplasm, several other systems bridge the inner and OMs via protein-protein interactions of different subunits, and are evolutionarily unrelated to the MCE protein family. Among these are the Lpt system, which uses ATP hydrolysis to translocate the glycolipid LPS across an open, solvent exposed “bridge” of LptA proteins toward a protein complex in the OM ( Botos et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2017; Okuda et al., 2012; Ruiz et al., 2008; Sperandeo et al., 2007, 2008; Suits et al., 2008; Tefsen et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2006 6.

USA. 2006; 103 :11754-11759 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 ). In contrast, other transenvelope transport systems employ a soluble periplasmic “ferry” protein to shuttle substrates between complexes in the IM and OM, as has been proposed for the lipoprotein export system Lol ( Konovalova and Silhavy, 2015 33. Konovalova, A. ∙ Silhavy, T.J. Outer membrane lipoprotein biogenesis: Lol is not the end Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2015; 370 :20150030 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a subset of MCE transporters, such as Mla ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 ). Thus, while “bridges” of LptA are used for LPS transport, the MCE family of transporters appears to employ at least two distinct strategies—ferries and tunnels—for periplasmic transport of phospholipids.
In contrast to the Lpt system, whose function is well established as an exporter of LPS, the direction of transport mediated by MCE systems is less clear, as are the particular lipid species transported by the diverse MCE systems encoded in bacterial genomes. Whether these systems act on different substrates, under different environmental conditions, or perhaps even drive transport in different directions, remain open questions. While the membrane protein LetA may be predicted to fulfill a role similar to the ABC transporter permease MlaE, they appear to be evolutionarily unrelated and may therefore function very differently from one another. Indeed, there is no evidence thus far that the Let system is driven by ATP hydrolysis, and we cannot rule out that other energy sources may be coupled to transport. Alternatively the Let system may allow passive equilibration of lipids between the IM and OM, in a manner conceptually similar to the sites of IM-OM hemifusion that were proposed over 50 years ago ( Bayer, 1968 5. Bayer, M.E. Areas of adhesion between wall and membrane of Escherichia coli J. Gen. Microbiol. 1968; 53 :395-404 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ) but could potentially be mediated by transenvelope protein complexes instead of direct interaction of the IM and OM to facilitate lipid exchange. Our studies presented here provide insights into the architecture and mechanism of LetB, which forms a dynamic tunnel poised to transport lipids across the periplasm.

All bacteria were grown in LB medium (Difco) or on LB plates (Difco broth supplemented with 1.5% nutrient agar) and incubated at 37 °C. For strains harboring a plasmid, the liquid medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and/or 38 μg/ml chloramphenical.
All mutants were constructed in the background of E. coli K-12 BW25113. Bacteria were grown in LB medium (Difco) or on LB plates (Difco broth supplemented with 1.5% nutrient agar) and incubated at 37 °C. For strains harboring a plasmid, the liquid medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. Strains with deletions of pqiAB and/or letAB were constructed in a previous study ( Isom et al., 2017 25. Isom, G.L. ∙ Davies, N.J. ∙ Chong, Z.-S. ... MCE domain proteins: conserved inner membrane lipid-binding proteins required for outer membrane homeostasis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8608 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the function of various LetB mutants, the WT letAB operon from BW25113 was cloned into pET17b, and leaky uninduced expression of LetAB from this plasmid was sufficient to complement a letAB chromosomal deletion. LetB mutations of interest were introduced into this plasmid carrying both letA and letB , yielding a construct that expressed WT LetA and the desired LetB mutant (including the TM helix). To test for functional complementation, 10-fold serial dilutions of overnight cultures of the relevant strains were prepared in a microtiter plate, and a multichannel pipette was used to spot 2 μl of each dilution to LB agar plates supplemented with sodium cholate (8%, Sigma Aldrich), sodium deoxycholate (4%, Sigma Aldrich), or lauryl sulfobetaine (LSB; (1%, Sigma Aldrich). The growth phenotypes in the presence of LSB are sensitive to at least these three aspects of the media preparation: 1) the LSB was dissolved in water to form a stock of 20% (w/v) that was aliquoted and frozen until further use, 2) the LB agar was made using LB broth mix (Difco) plus the addition of bacteriological agar (1.5%, Difco), as opposed to the use of an LB agar mix and 3) sufficient cooling of LB agar to approximately 60°C prior to the addition of LSB. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C, then photographed using a GelDoc system (Bio-Rad). At least three independent colonies were used to perform replicates for each phenotypic assay.
DNA corresponding to LetB lacking its TM region (residues 43-877) was amplified from the MG1655 genome and cloned by Gibson assembly into a custom pET vector (pBEL587) resulting in a C-terminal 6xHis tag, for cytoplasmic expression. The resulting plasmid (pBEL1324) was transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) cells (Novagen). For expression, overnight cultures of Rosetta 2 (DE3)/pBEL1324 were diluted 1:100 in LB (Difco) supplemented with carbenicillin (100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (38 μg/mL) and grown at 37°C with shaking to an OD600 of 0.9, then induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM and continued incubation overnight shaking at 15°C. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole). Cells were lysed by two passes through an Emulsiflex-C3 cell disruptor (Avestin), then centrifuged at 38,000 xg to pellet cell debris. The clarified lysates were incubated with NiNTA resin (QIAGEN) at 4°C, which was subsequently washed with Ni Wash Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) and bound proteins eluted with Ni Elution Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole). LetB containing fractions eluted from the NiNTA column were pooled and concentrated before separation on a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl.
All mutant forms of the LetB with the TM helix deleted were produced by introducing the target mutation into pBEL1324 by site-directed mutagenesis and Gibson assembly of the resulting PCR products, and purified following similar procedures.
In order to test the impact of tunnel length on LetB function, we set out to design shorter LetB derivatives consisting of two, three, four, five, or six MCE rings (versus seven rings in WT LetB). The challenge was to remove entire ring modules from LetB without disrupting the folding of adjacent rings, such that the variants would still fold, hexamerize, and form stable complexes with a range of tunnel lengths. For all mutant constructs, rings 1 and 7 were left intact, to preserve possible interactions with the inner and outer membranes/membrane proteins. Internal ring deletions were guided by our cryo-EM structure of LetB. First, the structure revealed that the interfaces between each ring in the stack are small and are formed by relatively flexible elements, primarily by short helical linkers that connect the MCE domains together with smaller interactions made by the tips of the PLLs ( Figure 1 E). Thus, we inferred that an independently folding structural module for each ring would most likely include the core MCE domain, its PLL, and the helical linker that follows it on the C-terminal side ( Figures 1 C and 1D), and therefore we targeted complete structural modules for deletion. Second, the conformational states observed in our structures suggested that the internal rings formed two groups: a rigid group (rings 2, 3, and 4) and a dynamic group that samples different conformations (rings 5 and 6). Using this knowledge as a guide, we designed constructs to preserve these groups of rings where possible. In order to make a four ring protein by removing three rings, we hypothesized that removing rings 2, 3, and 4 would be most likely to result in a stable complex; similarly, in order to make a five ring protein by removing two rings, we hypothesized that removing rings 5 and 6 would be least perturbing. For other variants, it was necessary to breakup one module or the other. In order to make a six ring protein by removing a single ring, we decided to remove either ring 5 or 6, since the dynamic nature of these rings implied that the interfaces between the rings are more flexible and might better tolerate perturbation (we opted to remove ring 6). Based upon the logic regarding the flexibility of rings 5 and 6, we created a three ring protein by removing four rings: the entire rigid module (ring 2, 3, and 4) plus the adjacent ring 5. This allowed us to a) avoid breaking up the rigid module and b) create only one “new” ring-ring interface (between rings 1 and 6, preserving the native interface between rings 6 and 7.
In order to test for expression of protein in the strains used for the complementation assays, 10 mL cultures of E. coli strains Δ pqiAB , Δ pqiAB Δ letAB and Δ pqiAB Δ letAB containing each complementation plasmid was grown to an OD of 0.6-0.8. The cells were pelleted at 4000 g for 10 mins and resuspended in 1 mL of freeze thaw lysis buffer (PBS, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 μl/ml of benzonase (Millipore)), and incubated on ice for 1 hour. The samples underwent 8 cycles of freeze-thaw lysis by alternating between liquid nitrogen and a 37°C heat block. After lysis, the cells were pelleted at 23,000 g for 15 minutes and the pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 2xSDS-page loading buffer. 10 μl of each sample were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in PBST containing 5% milk for 1 hour. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibody in PBST + 5% milk (either rabbit polyclonal anti-LetB (YebT) at a dilution of 1:1000 or rabbit polyclonal anti-BamA at a dilution of 1:2000) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then washed 3 times with PBST and were incubated with anti-rabbit HRP conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) in PBST + 5% milk for 1 hour. The membranes were then washed 3 times with PBST and incubated with ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) substrate and developed using autoradiography film (Denville).
To prepare grids for negative stain EM, the sample was applied to a freshly glow discharged carbon coated 400 mesh copper grids and blotted off. Immediately after blotting, a 2% uranyl formate solution was applied for staining and blotted off. The stain was applied five times for each sample. Samples were allowed to air dry before imaging. Data were collected on a Talos L120C TEM (FEI) equipped with a 4K x 4K OneView camera (Gatan) at a nominal magnification of 73,000x corresponding to a pixel size of 2.00 Å /pixel on the specimen, and a defocus range of 1 – 2 uM underfocus. Data processing was carried out in Relion 3.0 ( Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2017 19. Fernandez-Leiro, R. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. A pipeline approach to single-particle processing in RELION Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2017; 73 :496-502 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Micrographs were imported, particles were picked manually followed by automated template-based picking. Several rounds of 2D classification were carried out using default parameters, except for the offset search range and offset search step, which were adjusted to 60 and 5 pixels, respectively. At least two replicates were performed for negative stain EM of each sample, starting from expression of recombinant protein.
After size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (see Expression and Purification above), LetB was concentrated to 2 mg/mL. 3 μL of LetB at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL was applied to 400 mesh quantifoil 1.2/1.3 grids. The sample was then frozen in liquid ethane using the Vitrobot Mark III. Images were collected on a Titan Krios microscope (“Krios 2”) located at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus, operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector camera. Images were recorded using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 39. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3087) PubMed Google Scholar ) at a nominal magnification of 22,500x, corresponding to a pixel size of 1.31 Å. Further data collection parameters are shown in Table S1 .
Movies were drift corrected using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 76. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4281) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CTF estimation was performed using GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 74. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2308) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data were processed with Relion 2.1 ( Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2017; Kimanius et al., 2016 19. Fernandez-Leiro, R. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. A pipeline approach to single-particle processing in RELION Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2017; 73 :496-502 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Kimanius, D. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ∙ Scheres, S.H. ... Accelerated cryo-EM structure determination with parallelisation using GPUs in RELION-2 eLife. 2016; 5 :e18722 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ) unless otherwise stated, and the data processing workflow is described in Figure S2 . ~1,000 particles were selected manually and subjected to 2D classification. The resulting class averages were used as templates for subsequent automated particle picking. After 2D classification, 534,003 particles were selected from the 732,231 auto-picked particles and used for a first round of 3D classification. The map obtained from a reconstruction of the negatively stained sample ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) (EMDB ID: EMD-8611) was used as a reference for initial 3D classification into three classes named cl_1 to cl_3 (left side of Figure S2 ). The class cl_1 with 226,082 particles led to a reasonable map with the expected size, which was selected for further processing. Maps from the other two classes were poorly defined, especially at the two ends of LetB, and were temporarily discarded. The best map was refined to ~3.25 Å with a C6 symmetry and its local resolutions were estimated using blocres (kernel = 24 pixels) from Bsoft ( Heymann and Belnap, 2007 23. Heymann, J.B. ∙ Belnap, D.M. Bsoft: image processing and molecular modeling for electron microscopy J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :3-18 Crossref Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following strategies were used to improve resolution, and refinements were carried out in parallel with C6 symmetry imposed or no symmetry imposed (C1) for several maps. Final maps are with C6 symmetry imposed.
First, 3D classification into five classes of the whole map was performed. This resulted in classes dominated by different conformations in rings 5 to 7. In two of these classes, rings 5 to 7 adopt a closed conformation, and in two other classes, those rings adopt an open conformation where the tunnel diameter is larger. In the remaining class (cl_1.4 in Figure S2 ), density for ring 1 was not visible and was weak even when the map was refined with no enforced symmetry.
Second, to improve the local resolution and analyze conformational heterogeneity, we masked, refined and classified different parts of the density map. Different sizes and types of masks were explored. The regions of interest were masked out and the projection of the high-resolution map subtracted from the micrographs. Iterative 3D classification and refinement was carried out as shown in Figure S2 . The masking and signal subtraction of three consecutive rings was optimal, while refinement and classification of density corresponding to individual rings or of the pore-lining loops forming the central pore resulted in misalignment and poor resolution.
Finally, we investigated whether the resolution could be improved or new classes found by recovering the particles rejected by the initial 3D classification and using the maps obtained as starting references (right side of Figure S2 ). The whole process was repeated with the 534,003 particles originally selected after 2D classification instead of 226,082 and we thereby managed to further improve the resolution of the masked maps in the closed state.
The resolution of the best maps selected for de novo modeling varies from 2.96 Å to 3.78 Å. For each map, the overall resolution was estimated using the gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation criterion (FSC = 0.143). The FSC curves were calculated using soft masks and applying the masking-effect correction previously described ( Chen et al., 2013 11. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 3D FSC were computed using the “Remote 3DFSC Processing Server” at https://3dfsc.salk.edu/ ( Tan et al., 2017 68. Tan, Y.Z. ∙ Baldwin, P.R. ∙ Davis, J.H. ... Addressing preferred specimen orientation in single-particle cryo-EM through tilting Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :793-796 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ). The local resolution maps were computed using Bsoft ( Heymann and Belnap, 2007 23. Heymann, J.B. ∙ Belnap, D.M. Bsoft: image processing and molecular modeling for electron microscopy J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :3-18 Crossref Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further analyze the relative movements of the MCE domains, we ran multi-body refinements in Relion 3.0-beta ( Nakane et al., 2018 47. Nakane, T. ∙ Kimanius, D. ∙ Lindahl, E. ... Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION eLife. 2018; 7 :e36861 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) using model 1 (from map 1) of LetB. We tried non-overlapping masks of the 7 individual rings as well as masks of two consecutive rings with a one-ring overlap. Masking two consecutive rings with a one-ring overlap gave results that were interpretable. We also imported particles into CryoSparc v2.9 ( Punjani et al., 2017 53. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3661) PubMed Google Scholar ) to compute a 3D variability analysis using the map 1 obtained after 3D classification. Results are shown in Video S1 .
The MCE domain of MlaD (PDB ID: 5UW2 ) ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ), was used to assign the hand of our LetB density map, and as a starting point for model building. The MlaD coordinates were initially fit into the density of the best resolved domain of LetB, (ring 3). The sequence was mutated to match that of ring 3 and residues were manually adjusted in COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 18. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19609) PubMed Google Scholar ). The same process was repeated for all the other rings but using the model obtained for ring 3 as a reference. For each of the seven LetB rings, the initial model was built using the density map with the highest resolution (i.e., the masked map of the closed conformation for rings 1, 5, 6 and 7, and the wider masked density map for rings 2 to 4). The models were then subjected to the real_space_refine algorithm in PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2012 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution International Tables for Crystallography 2012; 539-547 Crossref Google Scholar ) using 1 to 5 cycles and 50 to 100 iterations to optimize the fit and reduce clashes. These models were iteratively rebuilt in COOT then refined in PHENIX until completion. The models refined against these first maps were then fit into all the other maps and underwent rebuilding and refinement to model the observed alternative states of LetB.
The PLL from each MCE domain emerges toward the lumen of the tunnel. As each loop roughly adopts a β-hairpin conformation, one would expect to observe two densities for each MCE domain (one corresponding to each strand of the β-hairpin), or 12 total densities for each hexameric MCE ring. However, for ring 5 in the open conformation, and for rings 2, 4, and 7, 18 densities are visible in each ring, as was observed for some of the rings of PqiB ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to the lower resolution of this part of the map, we were unable to identify whether the extra density corresponds to a bound substrate (such as a lipid), or flexibility of the loops which may adopt multiple conformations. Since masking and 3D classification were unable to separate out different states or improve the maps, we built a single conformation of each loop through the densities that yielded the most sterically plausible final models.
We also generated composite models of LetB corresponding a fully closed (where the pores of the MCE1, 5, 6, and 7 rings are simultaneously all in their most constricted/closed state) and open state (where the pores of the MCE1, 5, 6, and 7 rings are simultaneously all in their most dilated/open state). As our classification and signal subtraction approaches generally divided LetB into three-ring modules, it is unclear if these fully open and fully closed states are well populated, or if some rings may adopt an open state at the same time others are closed. However, we find these models best illustrate the extent of the conformational changes in the transport tunnel. The composite closed model was created by combining the models built into map 5 (rings 1 and 2), 4 (rings 3 and 4), 3 (rings 5 to 7) and 1 (4 residues linking rings 4 to 5). The composite open model was created by combining the models built into map 8 (rings 1 and 2), 7 (rings 3 and 4), 6 (rings 5 to 7) and 2 (4 residues linking rings 4 to 5).
Statistics regarding the final models ( Table S1 ) were extracted from the results of the real_space_refine algorithm as well as the the MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 10. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (10872) PubMed Google Scholar ) and EMRINGER ( Barad et al., 2015 4. Barad, B.A. ∙ Echols, N. ∙ Wang, R.Y.-R. ... EMRinger: side chain-directed model and map validation for 3D cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :943-946 Crossref Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ) functions as implemented in the PHENIX package ( Adams et al., 2012 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution International Tables for Crystallography 2012; 539-547 Crossref Google Scholar ). To display the movements between the closed and open configuration, we modified the ColorByRMSD plugin from pymol ( https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/ColorByRMSD ). To analyze the radii of the central pores, the CHAP software ( Klesse et al., 2019 32. Klesse, G. ∙ Rao, S. ∙ Sansom, M.S.P. ... CHAP: A Versatile Tool for the Structural and Functional Annotation of Ion Channel Pores J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431 :3353-3365 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Molecular graphics and analyses were performed with either the UCSF Chimera package ( Pettersen et al., 2004; Smart et al., 1993 52. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ...

As many new cryo-EM software versions have recently become available with new capabilities, we recovered the data used previously to obtain the EM density map and model of PqiB (PDB 5UVN ) ( Ekiert et al., 2017 17. Ekiert, D.C. ∙ Bhabha, G. ∙ Isom, G.L. ... Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane Cell. 2017; 169 :273-285 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) and reanalyzed it in Relion 2.1 Iterative 3D classification with masking and signal subtraction led to the identification of distinct closed and open states. When the classification is focused on the three MCE domains, we distinguish two clearly different classes: class 1 with 40,462 particles, and class 2 with 15,811 particles. These classes were refined at 3.8 Å and 4.4 Å respectively in which we fitted the model 5UVN. After a rigid-body docking of each MCE domain, the pore-lining loops of rings 1 and 2 of class 2 were further refined in Phenix. Multi-body refinement was carried out as described above for LetB.
DNA corresponding to the MCE2+MCE3 domains of LetB (residues 159-383) was amplified from the MG1655 genome and cloned by Gibson assembly into a custom pET vector (pDCE587) resulting in a C-terminal 6xHis tag. The resulting plasmid (pBEL1584) was transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) cells (Novagen). For expression, overnight cultures of Rosetta 2 (DE3)/pBEL1584 were diluted 1:100 in LB (Difco) supplemented with carbenicillin (100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (38 μg/mL) and incubated at 37°C with shaking at 225 RPM to an OD600 of 0.9, then induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM with continued shaking at 37°C for 4 hours. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl). Cells were lysed by two passes through an Emulsiflex-C3 cell disruptor (Avestin), then centrifuged at 38,000 xg to pellet cell debris. The clarified lysates loaded onto a cOmplete His-tag Purification column (Roche) at 4°C on an Akta FPLC (GE Healthcare), which was subsequently washed/eluted with a gradient of increasing concentrations of imidazole. LetB containing fractions eluted from the NiNTA column were pooled and concentrated before separation on a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl.
Size exclusion fractions containing LetB (residues 159-383, plus C-terminal His tag) were concentrated to 23 and 70 mg/mL, and sitting drop, vapor-diffusion crystallization trials were conducted using the JCSG Core I-IV screens (QIAGEN). Crystals grew from drops consisting of 100 nL protein plus 100 nL of a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 20% w/v PEG 1K, and were cryoprotected by supplementing the reservoir solution with 15% ethylene glycol. Native diffraction data was collected at the GM-CA/CAT beamline 23-ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source, and indexed to P6 5 and reduced using XDS (Table S4) ( Kabsch, 2010 28. Kabsch, Wolfgang Xds Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12644) PubMed Google Scholar ). This dataset was phased by molecular replacement using Phaser ( McCoy et al., 2007 42. McCoy, Airlie ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, W., Ralph ∙ Adams, D., Paul ... Phaser crystallographic software. Journal of applied crystallography. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (15799) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the MCE2 and MCE3 domains from the cryo-EM structure as search models. The resulting model was adjusted in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 18. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19609) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refined using Phenix ( Adams et al., 2012 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution International Tables for Crystallography 2012; 539-547 Crossref Google Scholar ). This final model consists of two copies of the MCE2-MCE3 domain fragment of LetB in a monomeric state.
T7express E. coli (NEB) were co-transformed with plasmids to express LetB (either WT or mutant forms derived from pBEL1324, without the TM helix) and pEVOL-pBpF (Addgene #31190), which encodes a tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for the in vivo incorporation p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (BPA) in E. coli proteins at the amber stop codon, TAG ( Chin et al., 2002; Isom et al., 2017 12.

Bacterial colonies were inoculated in LB broth supplemented with carbenicillin (100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (38 μg/mL) and grown overnight at 37°C. The following day, bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in 32 P Labeling Medium (a low phosphate minimal media we optimized starting from LS-5052 ( Studier, 2005 66. Studier, F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41 :207-234 Crossref Scopus (4453) PubMed Google Scholar ): 1 mM Na2HP04, 1 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM Na2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 20 mM Na2-Succinate, 0.2x trace metals and 0.2% glucose) supplemented with carbenicillin (100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (38 μg/mL) and inoculated 1:50 in the 10 mL of the same medium. Bacteria were grown to OD 0.9 and a final concentration of 1 mM IPTG, 0.2% L-arabinose and 0.5 mM BPA (Bachem), alongside 500 μCi 32 P orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer) were added and left to induce overnight. The following day, the cultures were spun down and resuspended in 1 mL of freeze-thaw lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 mM EDTA, 25U benzonase) and then underwent eight freeze-thaw cycles by alternating between liquid nitrogen and a 37°C heat block. Unbroken cells were pelleted at 12,000 xg for 2 mins and the lysates were transferred to a 12 well culture plate. Samples to undergo crosslinking were treated with 365 nM UV in a Spectrolinker for 30 mins. Each sample was then mixed with 25 μl of nickel beads (Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow) for 30 mins. The beads were pelleted at 500 xg for 1 min and the supernatant collected. The beads were then washed four times with detergent wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 0.25% Triton X-100) and finally resuspended in 50 μl of 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The beads were boiled for 5 mins to elute protein and spun down at 12,000 xg for 2 mins. Eluted protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained using InstantBlue Protein Stain (Expedeon). Relative LetB loading on the gel was estimated integrating the density of the corresponding bands in the InstantBlue-stained gel in ImageJ ( Rueden et al., 2017 55. Rueden, C.T. ∙ Schindelin, J. ∙ Hiner, M.C. ... ImageJ2: ImageJ for the next generation of scientific image data BMC Bioinformatics. 2017; 18 :529 Crossref Scopus (3888) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this was used to normalize the amount of LetB loaded on a second gel, to enable more quantitative comparisons between samples. The normalized gel was stained and 32 P signal was detected using a phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon scanner (Amersham). Three replicates of the experiment were performed, starting with protein expression.
Per-residue backbone RMSD values were calculated using superposed models in UCSF Chimera (using exclusively the secondary structure score and core domain strands and MlaD as a reference, Data S1 ( Meng et al., 2006 43. Meng, E.C. ∙ Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Couch, G.S. ...

Sievers, F. ∙ Higgins, D.G. Clustal Omega for making accurate alignments of many protein sequences Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :135-145 Crossref Scopus (1028) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S2 ). All statistical validation performed on the deposited models was done using PHENIX ( Tables S1 and S3 ).
