Title: Niche-Selective Inhibition of Pathogenic Th17 Cells by Targeting Metabolic Redundancy


Abstract: Summary

Targeting glycolysis has been considered therapeutically intractable owing to its essential housekeeping role. However, the context-dependent requirement for individual glycolytic steps has not been fully explored. We show that CRISPR-mediated targeting of glycolysis in T cells in mice results in global loss of Th17 cells, whereas deficiency of the glycolytic enzyme glucose phosphate isomerase (Gpi1) selectively eliminates inflammatory encephalitogenic and colitogenic Th17 cells, without substantially affecting homeostatic microbiota-specific Th17 cells. In homeostatic Th17 cells, partial blockade of glycolysis upon Gpi1 inactivation was compensated by pentose phosphate pathway flux and increased mitochondrial respiration. In contrast, inflammatory Th17 cells experience a hypoxic microenvironment known to limit mitochondrial respiration, which is incompatible with loss of Gpi1 . Our study suggests that inhibiting glycolysis by targeting Gpi1 could be an effective therapeutic strategy with minimum toxicity for Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, and, more generally, that metabolic redundancies can be exploited for selective targeting of disease processes.

Section: Introduction

Cellular metabolism is a dynamic process that supports all aspects of the cell’s activities. It is orchestrated by more than 2,000 metabolic enzymes organized into pathways that are specialized for processing and producing distinct metabolites. Multiple metabolites are shared by different pathways, serving as nodes in a complex network with many redundant elements. A well-appreciated example of metabolic plasticity is the generation of ATP by either glycolysis or by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), making the two processes partially redundant despite having other non-redundant functions ( O’Neill et al., 2016 59. O’Neill, L.A. ∙ Kishton, R.J. ∙ Rathmell, J. A guide to immunometabolism for immunologists Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16 :553-565 Crossref Scopus (1938) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we explore metabolic plasticity in the context of T cell function and microenvironment and the consequence of limiting that plasticity by inhibiting specific metabolic enzymes.
Th17 cells are a subset of CD4 + T cells whose differentiation is governed by the transcription factor RORγt, which regulates the expression of the signature interleukin-17 (IL-17) cytokines ( Ivanov et al., 2006 26.

Under homeostatic conditions, Th17 cells typically reside at mucosal surfaces where they provide protection from pathogenic bacteria and fungi and also regulate the composition of the microbiota ( Kumar et al., 2016 34.

In this study, we aimed to identify genes and pathways that are required for the function of inflammatory pathogenic Th17 cells but are dispensable for homeostatic Th17 cells, which may enable the selective therapeutic targeting of pathogenic Th17 cells.
T cell activation leads to extensive clonal expansion, demanding a large amount of energy and biomass production ( O’Neill et al., 2016 59. O’Neill, L.A. ∙ Kishton, R.J. ∙ Rathmell, J.

Glycolysis is central both in generating ATP and providing building blocks for macromolecular biosynthesis ( Zhu and Thompson, 2019 95. Zhu, J. ∙ Thompson, C.B. Metabolic regulation of cell growth and proliferation Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :436-450 Crossref Scopus (588) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glycolysis catabolizes glucose into pyruvate through ten enzymatic reactions. In normoxic environments, pyruvate is typically transported into the mitochondria to be processed by the tricarboxylic acid cycle, driving OXPHOS for ATP production. In hypoxic environments, OXPHOS is suppressed and glycolysis is enhanced, generating lactate from pyruvate in order to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) needed to support ongoing glycolytic flux ( Birsoy et al., 2015 6.

In highly proliferating cells, such as cancer cells and activated T cells, pyruvate can be converted into lactate in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon termed aerobic glycolysis or the “Warburg effect” ( MacIver et al., 2013 43.

Here, we systematically interrogate the requirement for individual glycolytic reactions in Th17 cell models of inflammation and homeostatic function. We found that the glycolysis gene Gpi1 is unique in that it is selectively required by inflammatory pathogenic Th17 but not homeostatic Th17 cells. All other tested glycolysis genes were essential for functions of both Th17 cell types. Our mechanistic study revealed that, upon Gpi1 loss during homeostasis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity was sufficient to maintain basal glycolytic flux for biomass generation, while increased mitochondrial respiration compensated for reduced glycolytic flux. In contrast, Th17 cells in the inflammation models are confined to hypoxic environments and hence were unable to increase respiration to compensate for reduced glycolytic flux. This metabolic stress led to the selective elimination of Gpi1-deficient Th17 cells in inflammatory settings but not in healthy intestinal lamina propria. Overall, our study reveals a context-dependent metabolic requirement that can be targeted to eliminate pathogenic Th17 cells. As Gpi1 blockade can be better tolerated than inhibition of other glycolysis components, it is a potentially attractive target for clinical use.

Commensal SFB induce the generation of homeostatic Th17 cells in the small intestine lamina propria (SILP) ( Ivanov et al., 2009 27. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Atarashi, K. ∙ Manel, N. ... Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria Cell. 2009; 139 :485-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3584) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) induces pathogenic Th17 cells in the spinal cord (SC), resulting in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) ( Cua et al., 2003 11.

Immunol. 2009; 10 :314-324 Crossref Scopus (854) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify genes involved in the pathogenic but not the homeostatic Th17 cell program, we reconstituted Rag1 −/− mice with isotype-marked Il23r -sufficient ( Il23r GFP/+ ) and Il23r knockout (KO) ( Il23r GFP/GFP ) bone marrow cells and sorted CD4 + T cells of both genetic backgrounds from the SILP of SFB-colonized mice and the SC of EAE mice for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis ( Figure S1 A). We identified 4 clusters of CD4 + T cells in the SC of EAE mice and 5 clusters of CD4 + T cells in ileum lamina propria of SFB-colonized mice ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Clusters were annotated based on their signature genes, i.e., Th17 cells ( Il17a ), Th1 cells ( Ifng ), Treg cells ( Foxp3 ), and Tcf7 + cells ( Tcf7 ) ( Figures S1 D and S1E). Importantly, two of the EAE clusters consist mostly of IL-23R-sufficient T cells ( Figures S1 F–S1H), indicating that these populations are likely pathogenic. One of them was annotated as Th17 and the other as Th1 ∗ according to earlier publications describing such cells as Il23r- dependent IFN-γ producers ( Hirota et al., 2011 23. Hirota, K. ∙ Duarte, J.H. ∙ Veldhoen, M. ... Fate mapping of IL-17-producing T cells in inflammatory responses Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :255-263 Crossref Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ; Okada et al., 2015 60. Okada, S. ∙ Markle, J.G. ∙ Deenick, E.K. ... IMMUNODEFICIENCIES. Impairment of immunity to Candida and Mycobacterium in humans with bi-allelic RORC mutations Science. 2015; 349 :606-613 Crossref Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ), and they were validated using flow cytometry ( Figure S1 I). Importantly, pathway enrichment analysis revealed glycolysis as the top pathway upregulated in both EAE Th17 and Th1 ∗ compared to the SFB-induced Th17 cells ( Figures S1 J and S1K).
We selected a subset of genes that were differentially expressed in the pathogenic Th17/Th1 ∗ cells (EAE model) versus the homeostatic Th17 cells (SFB model) for pilot functional studies ( Figures S1 L and S1M). We developed a CRISPR-based T cell transfer EAE system to evaluate the roles of the selected genes in pathogenicity ( Figures S2 A–S2C; see STAR Methods ). Among 12 genes tested, only triosephosphate isomerase 1 ( Tpi1 ), encoding an enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, was required for disease onset following transfer of in vitro -differentiated MOG-specific 2D2 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells ( Figure S2 D). This result was confirmed by analyzing Tpi1 f/f Cd4 cre mice, which, unlike Tpi1 +/+ CD4 cre littermates, were completely resistant to EAE induction ( Figure 1 A). This finding prompted us to direct our focus on the glycolysis pathway. The relatively sparse scRNA-seq data detected the transcripts of only a few glycolysis pathway genes. We therefore compared bulk RNA-seq data of the two major pathogenic populations (Th1 ∗ : IL-17a GFP- Klrc1 + Foxp3 RFP– , Th17: IL-17a GFP+ Klrc1 – Foxp3 RFP– ) and the Treg cells (Foxp3 RFP+ IL-17a GFP– Klrc1 - ) from the SC of EAE model mice and of the Th17 (IL-17a GFP+ Foxp3 RFP– ) and Treg (IL-17a GFP– Foxp3 RFP+ ) cells from the SILP of the SFB model ( Figures S2 E and S2F). We found that almost every glycolysis pathway gene was expressed at a higher level in the EAE model than in the SILP CD4 + T cells, irrespective of whether cells were pathogenic or Treg ( Figure 1 B), suggesting that most CD4 + T cells have more active glycolysis in the inflamed SC microenvironment than in the SILP at homeostasis.
Despite these differences in gene expression, Tpi1 was also indispensable for the SFB-dependent induction of homeostatic Th17 cells. We analyzed CD4 + T cell profiles in chimeric Rag1 KO mice reconstituted with a 1:1 mix of bone marrow cells from Tpi1 +/+ CD4 cre CD45.1/2 and Tpi1 f/f CD4 cre CD45.2/2 donors ( Figure S3 A). Tpi1 deficiency led to 33-fold reduction of total CD4 + T cells in the SILP and to 1.4- and 1.7-fold reduction in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) and the peripheral blood, respectively ( Figure 1 D). Moreover, RORγt, Foxp3, IL-17a, and IFN-γ were all severely reduced in mutant T cells relative to the wild-type (WT) cells in the SILP and mLN ( Figures S3 A and S3B). The same pattern was observed in the EAE model, using mixed bone marrow chimeric mice ( Figures 1 E and S3 C), indicating that Tpi1 is essential for the differentiation of all CD4 + T cell subsets.
The higher glycolytic activity of the inflammatory Th17 cells suggested that they may be more sensitive than the homeostatic Th17 cells to inhibition of glycolysis, which might be achieved by inactivation of Tpi1 , Gpi1 , or Ldha (explained in Figure S4 A). However, neither cell type is likely to survive a complete block in glycolysis by Gapdh KO. To test the hypothesis, we assessed the ability of co-transferred control and targeted TCR transgenic T cells to differentiate into Th17 cells in models of homeostasis (7B8 T cells in SFB-colonized mice [ Yang et al., 2014 89. Yang, Y. ∙ Torchinsky, M.B. ∙ Gobert, M. ... Focused specificity of intestinal TH17 cells towards commensal bacterial antigens Nature. 2014; 510 :152-156 Crossref Scopus (398) PubMed Google Scholar ]) and inflammatory disease (2D2 T cells for EAE [ Bettelli et al., 2003 5. Bettelli, E. ∙ Pagany, M. ∙ Weiner, H.L. ... Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific T cell receptor transgenic mice develop spontaneous autoimmune optic neuritis J. Exp.

Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ]) ( Figure 2 A). The genes of interest (indicated in Figure S4 A) or the control gene Olfr2 were inactivated by guide RNA electroporation of naive isotype-marked CD4 + TCR and Cas9 transgenic T cells ( Platt et al., 2014 69. Platt, R.J. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... CRISPR-Cas9 knockin mice for genome editing and cancer modeling Cell. 2014; 159 :440-455 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1389) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were then transferred in equal numbers into recipient mice ( Figures 2 A and S4 B). Targeting was performed with sgRNAs that achieved the highest in vitro KO efficiency (∼80%–90%) ( Figures S4 C–S4E), which corresponded to the frequency of targeted cells at 4 days after electroporation and transfer into mice, as assessed by targeting of GFP ( Figure S4 B). This strategy also allowed for efficient double-gene KO ( Figure S4 F).
In both SFB and EAE T cell transfer experiments, there were roughly 9-fold fewer Tpi1 -targeted than co-transferred control Th17 cells in the SILP or the SC, respectively ( Figures 2 B–2D), consistent with the in vitro KO efficiency ( Figure S4 C), suggesting that the majority of the Tpi1 KO cells were eliminated in the total T cell pool. The remaining cells expressed RORγt and IL-17a at a similar level to control populations ( Figures S5 A–S5D), which was not observed in the previous Tpi1 bone-marrow-reconstituted mice ( Figure S3 B), suggesting that they were not targeted. These results indicated that the electroporation transfer system could be successfully used to evaluate T cell gene functions in vivo .
Similar to the Tpi1 KO, cells deficient for Gapdh were eliminated in all three models tested ( Figures 2 B–2E). Inactivation of Ldha resulted in loss of the cells in the EAE model, and a less striking, but still substantial, cell-number reduction in the homeostatic SFB model ( Figures 2 B–2E). In contrast, although Gpi1 ablation reduced cell number by 75% in the inflammatory EAE and colitis models, it had no significant effect on cell number in the homeostatic Th17 cell model ( Figures 2 B–2E). Consistent with the reduction in cell number, Gpi1 mutant 2D2 cells were unable to induce EAE ( Figure 2 F), suggesting that Gpi1 is essential for pathogenicity. We also investigated Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine production by Gpi1 -deficient cells in the SFB model and found no difference from co-transferred control cells in terms of RORγt/Foxp3 expression ( Figures 2 G) or IL-17a production, as demonstrated using 7B8 cells from mice bred to the Il17a GFP/+ reporter strain ( Figure 2 H). In vitro restimulation further confirmed that transferred Gpi1-targeted 7B8 cells were indeed Gpi1 deficient ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Collectively, these data suggest that Gpi1 is selectively required by the inflammatory encephalitogenic and colitogenic Th17 cells but not by homeostatic SFB-induced Th17 cells. In contrast, Gapdh, Tpi1, and Ldha are required for the accumulation of both types of Th17 cells.
To explain why Gpi1 is dispensable in the homeostatic SFB model while other glycolysis genes are not, we hypothesized that the PPP shunt might maintain some glycolytic activity in the Gpi1 KO cells and thus compensate for Gpi1 deficiency ( Figure S4 A). We tested the hypothesis with in vitro isotope tracing. Irrespective of the non-pathogenic (npTh17, cultured in IL-6 and TGF-β [ Veldhoen et al., 2006 84.

This result resembles the different sensitivities observed in the homeostatic SFB model, suggesting that the cytokine milieu of the pathogenic and homeostatic Th17 cells does not account for the phenotypes of the Gpi1 mutant mice. We incubated np/p Th17 cells with 13 C 1,2 -glucose and analyzed downstream 13 C label incorporation. The 13 C 1,2 -glucose tracer is catabolized through glycolysis via Gpi1, producing pyruvate or lactate containing two heavy carbons (M2), while Gpi1-independent shunting through the PPP produces pyruvate and lactate containing one heavy carbon (M1) ( Figure 3 B) ( Lee et al., 1998 36. Lee, W.N. ∙ Boros, L.G. ∙ Puigjaner, J. ... Mass isotopomer study of the nonoxidative pathways of the pentose cycle with [1,2-13C2]glucose Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274 :E843-E851 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed an ∼3-fold increase in relative PPP activity in the Gpi1 KO Th17 cells compared to the Olfr2 KO control, irrespective of npTh17 or pTh17 condition ( Figure 3 C), indicating that Gpi1 deficiency maintains active glycolytic flux through PPP shunting.
To test whether PPP activity compensates for Gpi1 deficiency in vivo in the homeostatic SFB model, we knocked out both Gpi1 and G6pdx , which catalyzes the initial oxidative step in the PPP, with the CRISPR-electroporation transfer system. Combined deletion of these two genes would be expected to block glycolysis, similar to Gapdh KO. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Gpi1/G6pdx double KO reduced cell number by about 75%, which is similar to that with the Gapdh single KO yet significantly different from that with inactivation of either Gpi1 or G6pdx alone ( Figure 3 D). These results suggest that in vivo PPP activity maintains viability of the homeostatic SFB-induced Th17 cells lacking Gpi1.
To determine the impact of Gpi1 deficiency on aerobic glycolysis activity, we quantified lactate production by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and found it to be markedly reduced in Gpi1 KO cells ( Figure 4 A). A significant reduction in lactate production may suggest compromised glycolytic ATP production in Gpi1 KO cells. As in vitro -cultured Gpi1 KO Th17 cells and homeostatic SFB-specific Gpi1 KO Th17 cells were largely unaffected in terms of cell number and cytokine production, we speculate that mitochondrial respiration may provide an alternative source of ATP to compensate. Indeed, in vitro -cultured Gpi1 KO cells displayed a higher ATP-linked respiration rate than Olfr2 control cells, irrespective of npTh17 or pTh17 cell-culture condition ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Furthermore, upon Antimycin A (complex III inhibitor) treatment, Gpi1 KO cells were decreased in cell number, similar to Gapdh -deficient cells ( Figure 4 D), consistent with increased mitochondrial respiration compensating for Gpi1 deficiency in the in vitro cell-culture system.
To determine whether increased respiration rescues Gpi1 deficiency in vivo in the homeostatic SFB model, we targeted Gpi1 in 7B8 T cells along with genes responsible for the oxidation of three major substrates feeding the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: Pdha1 (pyruvate), Gls1 (glutamine), and Hadhb (fatty acids). Following co-transfer of control cells and cells lacking Pdha1 , Gls1 , or Hadhb , there was no defect in Th17 cell number, RORγt expression, or cytokine production (data not shown). However, only double KO of Gpi1 and Pdha1 led to a significant reduction in cell number, similar to that with the Gapdh KO cells ( Figure 4 E), suggesting that mitochondrial respiration through pyruvate oxidation compensates for Gpi1 deficiency in homeostatic Th17 cell differentiation induced by SFB colonization.
Compensation for Gpi1 deletion by the combination of the PPP and mitochondrial respiration suggests the existence of a partial metabolic redundancy for Gpi1. To understand the compensatory mechanism, we performed kinetic flux profiling, employing GC-MS to measure the passage of isotope label from 13 C 6 -glucose into downstream metabolites ( Yuan et al., 2008 90. Yuan, J. ∙ Bennett, B.D. ∙ Rabinowitz, J.D. Kinetic flux profiling for quantitation of cellular metabolic fluxes Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3 :1328-1340 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting kinetic data, along with metabolite abundance, was used to quantify metabolic flux in npTh17 cells prepared from Gpi1 KO, Olfr2 KO, and cells treated with koningic acid (KA), to inhibit Gapdh ( Liberti et al., 2017 40. Liberti, M.V. ∙ Dai, Z. ∙ Wardell, S.E. ... A Predictive Model for Selective Targeting of the Warburg Effect through GAPDH Inhibition with a Natural Product Cell Metab. 2017; 26 :648-659 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ), since more than 50% of cells in the Gapdh KO culture were WT escapees ( Figure S4 C).
Loss of Gpi1 resulted in reduction of glucose uptake ( Figure 5 A) and in substantially decreased transmission of isotopic label to intracellular pyruvate and lactate, whose abundance was also reduced ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and 5I). Interestingly, a lower lactate production/glucose consumption ratio was observed in Gpi1 KO than control cells ( Figure 5 B), suggesting that Gpi1-deficient cells may be more inclined to use glucose carbons for the synthesis of biosynthetic metabolites, rather than lactate production. Indeed, the labeling rate and total abundance of the biosynthetic metabolites alanine, serine, glycine, and citrate either did not change or were slightly increased in the Gpi1 KO cells ( Figures 5 E–5I). The flux of pyruvate, lactate, alanine, serine, and glycine in the Gpi1-deficient cells, as compared to Olfr2 KO control ( Figure 5 J), was consistent with the PPP supporting the branching pathways of glycolysis important for biosynthetic metabolite production, despite a reduced glycolysis rate. In contrast, Gapdh inhibition by KA treatment almost completely prevented the synthesis of downstream metabolites ( Figures 5 C–5H) and lactate production ( Figure 5 K). However, it did not induce an increase in OCR ( Figures 5 K and 5L), possibly due to the severely limited production of pyruvate.
Taken together, we conclude that the reduced amount of glucose metabolized via the PPP by Gpi1 -deficient cells was sufficient to support the production of glycolytic intermediates and maintain pyruvate oxidation. Gpi1 -deficient cells increased their mitochondrial respiration to compensate for the loss of glycolytic flux. In contrast, glycolytic blockade by Gapdh inhibition completely prevented carbon flux needed for key biosynthetic metabolites, which is incompatible with cell viability.
To understand why inflammatory Th17 cells are particularly sensitive to Gpi1 deficiency, we reasoned that metabolic compensation (either through PPP or mitochondrial respiration), which occurs in the homeostatic model, may be restricted in inflammatory Th17 cells. G6pdx KO in the EAE model resulted in a 70% reduction in 2D2 cell number in the SC ( Figures S6 A and S6B), suggesting that PPP flux is still active in the setting of inflammation. On the other hand, a number of reports have shown that inflamed tissues, including the SC in EAE and the large intestine lamina propria (LILP) in colitis, are associated with low oxygenation (hypoxia) ( Davies et al., 2013 13.

This suggests that impaired mitochondrial respiration might occur, which would result in an inability to provide sufficient ATP to compensate for energy loss due to Gpi1 deficiency in these tissues. To test this hypothesis, we cultured Th17 cells in normoxic (20% O 2 ) and mild hypoxic (3% O 2 ) conditions and found that Gpi1 KO Th17 cells in the hypoxic state, irrespective of npTh17 or pTh17 differentiation protocols, displayed a growth defect similar to that occurring with Gapdh deficiency ( Figure 6 A). Furthermore, Olfr2 control npTh17 cells displayed about a 2-fold increase in lactate production in hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions ( Figure S6 C), indicating that hypoxic cells rely more on glycolysis to generate ATP. Gpi1 KO cells had substantially decreased lactate production in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions ( Figure S6 C), but there was reduced intracellular ATP only with hypoxia ( Figure S6 D), suggesting that restrained mitochondrial respiration in hypoxia cannot compensate for Gpi1 inactivation and hence leads to energy crisis.
We next investigated whether the inflamed tissue in the EAE model differs from the homeostatic tissue in the SFB model with regard to oxygen availability. To address this, we performed an intravenous injection of pimonidazole, an indicator of O 2 levels, into mice with EAE or with SFB colonization, and found that CD4 + T cells in the EAE model SC had a 2-fold higher pimonidazole staining than in the dLN and ∼2.7-fold compared to CD4 + T cells in SILP and mLN ( Figure 6 B). This result suggests that CD4 + T cells in the SC of the EAE model experience greater oxygen deprivation than in other tissues examined. The increased labeling in the SC was observed in all subsets of CD4 + T cells ( Figures S6 E and S6F), indicating that decreased oxygen availability is likely a tissue feature.
Hif1α is an oxygen sensor that, upon activation by hypoxia, initiates transcription of genes, including glycolysis genes, to allow cells to adapt in poorly oxygenated tissue ( Corcoran and O’Neill, 2016 10.

Invest. 2013; 123 :3664-3671 Crossref Scopus (1000) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further examine the oxygenation level of SILP and SC, we investigated the effect of Hif1a deficiency in the different models of CD4 + T cell differentiation. Using chimeric Rag1 KO mice reconstituted with equal numbers of Hif1a +/+ CD4 cre and Hif1a f/f CD4 cre bone marrow cells, there was an ∼40% reduction of Hif1α-deficient CD4 + T cells in the SC of mice with EAE but little difference in the SILP ( Figures 6 C–6E). Furthermore, in the SILP of SFB-colonized mice, there was no significant difference in RORγt and Foxp3 expression or IL-17a and IFN-γ production between WT and KO CD4 + T cells ( Figures S6 G and S6H). In contrast, in the SC of the EAE mice, there was a slight decrease in the Th17 cell fractions and increase in the Foxp3 + fraction in the Hif1a KO compared to WT CD4 + T cells ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Overall, these data suggest that Hif1α is functionally important for the pathogenic Th17 cells (as well as Treg cells) in the EAE model, but not for homeostatic SILP Th17 cells, reinforcing the conclusion of the pimonidazole experiment that T cells in the inflamed SC experience greater oxygen deprivation than those in the healthy SILP.
To address when and how Gpi1 deficiency impairs inflammatory Th17 cell differentiation and/or function, we performed a time-course experiment to assess the kinetics of the co-transferred Olfr2 KO control and Gpi1 KO 2D2 cells in the EAE model. Gpi1 KO T cells, like Olfr2 KO control cells, were maintained in the dLN until day 13, the last time point when transferred 2D2 cells were still detectable in the draining lymph nodes (dLN) ( Figure 6 E). However, at 13 days post-immunization, Gpi1 mutant cell number was reduced by 50% compared to control T cells in the SC ( Figure 6 E). This finding is consistent with the previous observation that the SC, but not the dLN, is hypoxic. Accordingly, we observed reduced proliferation of Gpi1 KO 2D2 cells in the SC but not in the dLN ( Figures 6 F and S6 I). Importantly, 2D2 cells in the dLN of mice with EAE proliferated at a markedly faster rate than 7B8 cells in the mLN of the SFB model ( Figures S6 J and S6K). This demonstrates that Gpi1-deficient 2D2 cells can maintain the higher demand for energy and biomass associated with rapid proliferation and emphasizes the role of the SC hypoxic environment in the T cell’s dependence on Gpi1. We also examined Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine production, by staining for RORγt/Foxp3 and IL-17a, apoptosis, by staining for the active form of caspase 3, and potential for migration, by staining for Ccr6, and observed no differences between Gpi1 -deficient and co-transferred control Olfr2 KO 2D2 T cells ( Figures S6 L–S6P). We conclude that Th17 cells increase glycolysis activity to adapt to the hypoxic environment in the EAE SC, and the restrained mitochondrial respiration in this setting cannot compensate for the loss of glycolytic ATP production upon Gpi1 inactivation, leading to energy crisis and cell elimination.

Section: Discussion

Our results demonstrate the remarkable plasticity of cellular metabolism owing to redundant components in the network and highlight that plasticity can vary based on microenvironmental factors. Due to the unique position of Gpi1 in the glycolysis pathway, its deficiency was compensated by the combination of two metabolic pathways—the PPP and mitochondrial respiration. The PPP maintained glycolytic activity, albeit at a reduced level, to fully support biosynthetic precursor synthesis through branching pathways. Pyruvate, which is also produced by way of the PPP, increased its flux into the TCA cycle, elevating ATP production from mitochondrial respiration, thus compensating for loss of ATP production from glycolysis. Therefore, upon Gpi1 inactivation, homeostatic SFB-induced Th17 cells reprogrammed their metabolism, retaining the ability to provide adequate biomass and energy to support cell function. In contrast, limitation of mitochondrial respiration due to low oxygen availability in the inflamed EAE SC rendered Gpi1-deficient cells unable to generate sufficient ATP molecules either through glycolysis or mitochondrial respiration, resulting in energy crisis and cell elimination. Inactivation of Gapdh, whose function, unlike that of Gpi1, cannot be compensated by other metabolic pathways, completely blocked glycolysis and hence led to elimination of both homeostatic and inflammatory Th17 cells. Our results suggest not only that suppressing glycolysis by Gpi1 inhibition could be a well-tolerated treatment for hypoxia-related autoimmune diseases but also that metabolic redundancies can be exploited for targeting disease processes in selected tissues.
We found that CD4 + T cells (pathogenic or Treg) in the EAE model had greater expression of glycolytic genes than homeostatic CD4 + T cells, which is consistent with the recent demonstration that Citrobacter -induced inflammatory Th17 cells were more glycolytic than SFB-induced homeostatic Th17 cells ( Omenetti et al., 2019 62. Omenetti, S. ∙ Bussi, C. ∙ Metidji, A. ... The Intestine Harbors Functionally Distinct Homeostatic Tissue-Resident and Inflammatory Th17 Cells Immunity. 2019; 51 :77-89 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that T cells adapt to the hypoxic environment in the inflamed SC by upregulating glycolysis, most likely by hypoxia-stabilized Hif1α.
In spite of the difference in glycolytic activity, blockade of glycolysis by Gapdh KO is incompatible with Th17 cell expansion and differentiation in either homeostatic or inflammatory models. However, the finding that Gpi1-deficient 2D2 T cells proliferated normally in the dLN of the EAE model suggests that T cell activation and differentiation in vivo do not necessarily need a fully functional glycolytic pathway. With the PPP providing sufficient metabolites for biomass production and mitochondria generating greater amounts of ATP, T cell proliferation and execution of the non-pathogenic Th17 program in vivo can be largely maintained in the Gpi1 KO cells. Our data highlight the complexity of the glycolysis pathway and suggest that not every enzyme is equally important to glycolytic activity and cell function.

HIF1alpha-dependent glycolytic pathway orchestrates a metabolic checkpoint for the differentiation of TH17 and Treg cells J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :1367-1376 Crossref Scopus (1392) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our in vivo genetic data, however, support an indispensable role of glycolysis in Treg cell differentiation, as demonstrated by complete loss of the intestinal and SC Foxp3 + T cells in mice deficient for Tpi1 in T cells.
One intriguing finding that we have not characterized in detail is the dispensable role of Pdha1, Gls1, and Hadhb in SFB-induced homeostatic Th17 cell differentiation. While OXPHOS is essential for SFB-specific Th17 cells (data not shown), their ability to differentiate in the absence of genes controlling metabolite fueling of the TCA cycle suggests potential redundancies. Furthermore, the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro function of Pdha1 (as shown in this study) and Gls1 (by comparing the in vivo data in this study with reported in vitro data [ Johnson et al., 2018 29. Johnson, M.O. ∙ Wolf, M.M. ∙ Madden, M.Z. ... Distinct Regulation of Th17 and Th1 Cell Differentiation by Glutaminase-Dependent Metabolism Cell. 2018; 175 :1780-1795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ]) suggests that the microenvironment is critical for T cell metabolism and gene function, as does a recent report showing distinct metabolism profiles of in vivo and in vitro -activated T cells ( Ma et al., 2019 41. Ma, E.H. ∙ Verway, M.J. ∙ Johnson, R.M. ... Metabolic Profiling Using Stable Isotope Tracing Reveals Distinct Patterns of Glucose Utilization by Physiologically Activated CD8(+) T Cells Immunity. 2019; 51 :856-870 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our study reveals that Gpi1 may be a good drug target for Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases. The sensitivity to Gpi1 deficiency is dependent on whether cells are competent to increase mitochondrial respiration. Therefore, other disease processes involving hypoxia-related pathologies may also be susceptible to Gpi1 inhibition. A recent report showed that 1% O 2 almost completely inhibited in vitro growth of Gpi1 mutant tumor cell lines, but the proliferation defect was much milder when cells were cultured in normoxic condition ( de Padua et al., 2017 14. de Padua, M.C. ∙ Delodi, G. ∙ Vučetić, M. ... Disrupting glucose-6-phosphate isomerase fully suppresses the “Warburg effect” and activates OXPHOS with minimal impact on tumor growth except in hypoxia Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :87623-87637 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that hypoxia-mediated sensitivity to Gpi1 deficiency can be a general phenomenon, from Th17 cells to tumor cells, which may extend the deployment of Gpi1 inhibition to a broader range of diseases.
Sensitivity to inhibition of both Hif1α and Gpi1 is dependent on oxygen availability. In the mixed bone marrow chimera experiments with the EAE model, there was less than a 2-fold reduction in Hif1a mutant compared to WT SC CD4 + T cells, whereas Gpi1 -targeted T cells were reduced 5-fold compared to WT cells in the transfer model of EAE. Hif1a inactivation efficiency was almost complete (data not shown), while Gpi1 KO efficiency was roughly 80%, which suggests that Gpi1 deficiency resulted in a more severe defect than Hif1a deficiency when the T cells were in a hypoxic environment. This is not unexpected, as Gpi1 itself participates in the glycolysis pathway, while Hif1α regulates the transcription of genes in the pathway. Although EAE was attenuated following Hif1a inactivation in CD4 + T cells ( Dang et al., 2011 12. Dang, E.V. ∙ Barbi, J. ∙ Yang, H.Y. ... Control of T(H)17/T(reg) balance by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 Cell. 2011; 146 :772-784 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1244) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2011 76. Shi, L.Z. ∙ Wang, R. ∙ Huang, G. ... HIF1alpha-dependent glycolytic pathway orchestrates a metabolic checkpoint for the differentiation of TH17 and Treg cells J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :1367-1376 Crossref Scopus (1392) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results suggest that Gpi1 inhibition may be at least as effective a means of blocking cell function in hypoxic microenvironments.
While our data suggest that hypoxia is an essential factor that restains proliferation of Gpi1-deficient Th17 cells in the SC, we cannot exclude the possibility that other environmental factors also contribute to the phenotype, as oxygenation level is certainly not the only difference between the inflamed SC and the healthy SILP.
Glycolysis is a universal metabolic pathway whose blockade by inhibitors such as 2DG can yield adverse side effects even at dosages too low to control tumor growth ( Raez et al., 2013 71. Raez, L.E. ∙ Papadopoulos, K. ∙ Ricart, A.D. ... A phase I dose-escalation trial of 2-deoxy-D-glucose alone or combined with docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2013; 71 :523-530 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2DG inhibits the first three steps of glycolysis, an effect that is recapitulated by Gapdh inhibition, given that no alternative pathway exists for glucose catabolism. Although glycolysis is essential for T cell activation, treating diseases caused by autoimmune T cells with drugs that fully inhibit the pathway, e.g., 2DG or KA, would also likely be too toxic at potentially efficacious dosages. In light of the results presented here, Gpi1 may represent a better drug target than other glycolysis gene products for treating Th17-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, as targeting Gpi1 may be well tolerated by most cells and tissues, thus causing minimal side effects.
This hypothesis is supported by genetic data obtained from patients with glycolysis gene deficiencies. With few exceptions, patients deficient for Tpi1 or Pgk1 have combined symptoms of anemia, mental retardation, and muscle weakness (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] entry 190450, 311800) ( Schneider, 2000 72. Schneider, A.S. Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency: historical perspectives and molecular aspects Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2000; 13 :119-140 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutations in glycolysis gene products that have redundant isozymes can result in dysfunction of cell types in which only the mutated isozyme gets expressed, such that Pgam2 deficiency results in muscle breakdown and Pklr deficiency causes anemia ( Zanella et al., 2005 92. Zanella, A. ∙ Fermo, E. ∙ Bianchi, P. ... Red cell pyruvate kinase deficiency: molecular and clinical aspects Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 130 :11-25 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). The human genetic data are thus consistent with the prediction that inhibition of glycolysis enzymes would result in serious side effects. However, the vast majority of patients with Gpi1 mutations, which can result in preservation of less than 20% enzymatic activity, have mild to severe anemia that is treatable, with no neurological or muscle developmental defects ( Baronciani et al., 1996 3.

These clinical data indicate that neurons and muscle cells can afford losing most of their Gpi1 activity even though they require glycolysis, and hence they behave similarly to homeostatic Th17 cells. Collectively, these patient data strongly support our proposal that Gpi1 can be a therapeutic target.

Our study demonstrates compensatory metabolic pathways in CD4 + T cells in vivo and highlights that such redundancy can be selective, depending on the cellular microenvironment. Indeed, specific inhibition of pathogenic cells can be achieved by metabolic targeting of selective redundant components. Therefore, characterization of the metabolic redundancy of cells in microenvironments with varying oxygen level, pH, abundance of extracellular metabolites, redox status, cytokine milieu, or temperature, may provide opportunities for metabolic targeting of cells in selected tissue microenvironments for therapeutic purposes.

They were crossed to the Cas9 Tg Cd45.1/1 mice to generate 7B8 Cas9 Tg , 2D2 Cas9 Tg , and HH7-2 Cas9 Tg mice with either Cd45.1/1 or Cd45.1/2 congenic markers. 7B8 Cas9 CD45.1/2 mice were further crossed with IL17a GFP/GFP reporter mice (JAX; C57BL/6-Il17atm1Bcgen/J) to generate 7B8 Cas9 IL17a GFP/ + Cd45.1/2 or Cd45.2/2 mice. Female Foxp3 RFP/RFP reporter mice (Jax; C57BL/6-Foxp3 tm1Flv /J) were crossed with male IL17a GFP/GFP reporter mice to generate IL17a GFP/+ Foxp3 RFP male mice for bulk RNaseq. Hif1a f/f mice (Jax; B6.129-Hif1a tm3Rsjo /J) were crossed with CD4 cre mice (Jax; B6.Cg-Tg(Cd4-cre)1Cwi/BfluJ) and CD45.1/1 mice to generate Hif1a +/+ CD4 cre CD45.1/1 and Hif1a f/f CD4 cre CD45.2/2 littermates.

For transcription factor and cytokine staining of ex vivo cells, single cell suspensions were incubated for 3h in RPMI with 10% FBS, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (50 ng/ml; Sigma), ionomycin (500 ng/ml;Sigma) and GolgiStop (BD). Cells were then resuspended with surface-staining antibodies in HEPES-buffered HBSS. Staining was performed for 20-30 min on ice. Surface-stained cells were washed and resuspended in live/dead fixable blue (ThermoFisher) for 5 min prior to fixation. Cells were treated using the FoxP3 staining buffer set from eBioscience according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Intracellular stains were prepared in 1X eBioscience permwash buffer containing anti-CD16/anti-CD32, normal mouse IgG, and normal rat IgG Staining was performed for 30-60 min on ice.
For cytokine analysis of in vitro cultured Th17 cells, cells were incubated in the restimulation buffer for 3 h. After surface and live/dead staining, cells were treated using the Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer set from BD Biosciences according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Intracellular stains were prepared in BD permwash in the same manner used for transcription factor staining. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on an LSR II (BD Biosciences) or an Aria II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
The protocol described in this section was only used for experiments shown in Figures 2 F and S2 A–S2D. sgRNAs were designed using the Crispr guide design software ( http://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources ). sgRNA encoding sequences were cloned into the retroviral sgRNA expression vector pSIN-U6-sgRNAEF1as-Thy1.1-P2A-Neo that has been reported before ( Ng et al., 2019 58. Ng, C. ∙ Aichinger, M. ∙ Nguyen, T. ... The histone chaperone CAF-1 cooperates with the DNA methyltransferases to maintain Cd4 silencing in cytotoxic T cells Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :669-683 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). To make the double sgRNA vector for experiments shown in Figures S2 A–S2D, the sgRNA transcription cassette, ranging from the U6 promoter to the U6 terminator, was amplified (primer sequences can be found in the Key Resources Table ) and cloned into the pSIN vector after the first sgRNA encoding cassette. For the EAE experiment shown in Figure 2 F, only one sgRNA was used for each virus. Retroviruses were packaged in PlatE cells by transient transfection using TransIT 293 (Mirus Bio).
Tissue culture plates were coated with polyclonal goat anti-hamster IgG (MP Biomedicals) at 37 °C for at least 3 h and washed 3 × with PBS before cell plating. FACS-sorted CD4 + CD8 − CD25 − CD62L + CD44 low -naive 2D2 TCRtg Cas9 Tg T cells were seeded for 24 h in T cell medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 2mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2mM glutamine), along with anti-CD3 (BioXcell, clone 145-2C11, 0.25 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (BioXcell, clone 37.5.1, 1 μg/ml) antibodies. Cells were then transduced with the pSIN virus by spin infection at 1200 × g at 30 °C for 90 min in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Viral supernatants were removed 12 h later and replaced with fresh medium containing anti-CD3/anti-CD28, 20ng/ml IL-6 and 0.3ng/ml TGF-β. Cells were lifted off 48 h later and supplemented with IL-2 for another 48hours. Thy1.1 high cells were then sorted with the ARIA and i.v. injected into Rag1 −/− mice (50k cells/mouse). Mice were then immunized subcutaneously on day 0 with 100μg of MOG 35-55 peptide, emulsified in CFA (Complete Freund’s Adjuvant supplemented with 2mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra), and injected i.p. with 200 ng pertussis toxin (Calbiochem). The EAE scoring system was as follows: 0-no disease, 1-Partially limp tail; 2-Paralyzed tail; 3-Hind limb paresis, uncoordinated movement; 4-One hind limb paralyzed; 5-Both hind limbs paralyzed; 6-Hind limbs paralyzed, weakness in forelimbs; 7-Hind limbs paralyzed, one forelimb paralyzed; 8-Hind limbs paralyzed, both forelimbs paralyzed; 9-Moribund; 10-Death.
sgRNA-encoding sequences were cloned into the pSIN vector (single sgRNA in one vector). The sgRNA encoding cassette, ranging from the U6 promoter to the U6 terminator, was amplified with 34 cycles of PCR with Phusion (NEB), and purified with Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega), and concentrated with a standard ethanol DNA precipitation protocol. Amplicons were resuspended in a small volume of H 2 O and kept at −80 °C until use. Amplicon concentration was measured with Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermofisher)
The Amaxa P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X kit was used for T cell electroporation. 2 million FACS-sorted naive CD4 + Cas9 Tg cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100ul P3 primary cell solution supplemented with 0.56ug sgRNA amplicon (for single gene knockout), or equal amounts of sgRNA amplicons (0.56ug each for targeting two genes simultaneously in Figures 3 D and 4 E). For GFP KO ( Figure S4 B), a mixture of three pSIN vectors at equal amount containing different sgRNA-encoding sequences (all targeting GFP) was used as template for PCR amplifaction, and 0.56ug of amplicon was used for electroporation. Cell suspensions were transferred into a Nucleocuvette Vessel for electroporation in the Nucleofector X unit, using program “T cell. Mouse. Unstim.” Cells were then rested in 500 ul mouse T cell nucleofector medium (Lonza) for 30 min before in vitro culture or transfer into mice.
In vitro cell culture – 96 well flat-bottom tissue culture plates (Corning) were coated with polyclonal goat anti-hamster IgG (MP Biomedicals) at 37 °C for at least 3 h and washed 3 × with PBS before cell plating. Electroporated cells were plated into each well containing 200ul T cell culture medium (glucose-free RPMI (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals), 4g/L glucose, 4mM glutamine, 50uM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 μg/ml anti-CD3 (BioXcell, clone 145-2C11) and 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 (BioXcell, clone 37.5.1) antibodies). For npTh17 culture, 20ng/ml IL-6 and 0.3ng/ml TGF- β were further added into the T cell medium. For pTh17 cell culture, 20ng/ml IL-6, 20ng/ml IL-23, and 20ng/ml IL-1β were further added into the T cell medium. Cells were then cultured for 96 h or 120 h in normoxia or hypoxia (3% oxygen) before metabolic experiments or cell number counting/western/FACS profiling, respectively.
T cell transfer into mice – TCR transgenic Cas9 Tg naive CD4 + T cells (7B8 TCRtg for SFB model, 2D2 TCRtg for EAE model, and HH7-2 TCRtg for colitis model) with different isotype markers were electroporated at the same time. Equal numbers of isotype-distinct electroporated resting cells were mixed, pelleted and resuspended in dPBS supplemented with 1% filtered FBS before retro-orbital injection into recipient mice (100,000 cells in total for each mouse). The transferred cells were isolated from SILP of the SFB model, SC of the EAE model, and the LILP of the colitis model at day 15 post transfer, unless otherwise indicated.
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and maintained in SFB-free SPF cages. Fresh feces of SFB mono-colonized mice maintained in our gnotobiotic animal facility were collected and frozen at −80 °C until use. Fecal pellets were meshed through a 100uM strainer (Corning) in cold sterile dPBS (Hyclone). 300 μL feces suspension, equal to the amount of 1/3 pellet, was administered to each mouse by oral gavage. Mice were inoculated one more time at 24 h. For the transfer experiment, electroporated cells were injected 96 h after the initial gavage.
H. hepaticus was provided by J. Fox (MIT) and grown on blood agar plates (TSA with 5% sheep blood, Thermo Fisher) as previously described ( Xu et al., 2018 87. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Rag1 −/− mice were colonized with H. hepaticus by oral gavage on days 0 and 4 of the experiment. At day 7, electroporated naive HH7-2 TCRtg Cas9 Tg CD4 + T cells were adoptively transferred into the H. hepaticus-colonized recipients. In order to confirm H. hepaticus colonization, H. hepaticus-specific 16S primers were used on DNA extracted from fecal pellets. Universal 16S were quantified simultaneously to normalize H. hepaticus colonization of each sample.
Right after the transfer of electroporated 2D2 Cas9 Tg cells, mice were immunized subcutaneously on day 0 with 100μg of MOG 35-55 peptide, emulsified in CFA (Complete Freund’s Adjuvant supplemented with 2mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra), and injected i.p. on days 0 and 2 with 200 ng pertussis toxin (Calbiochem).
For isolating mononuclear cells from the lamina propria, the intestine (small and/or large) was removed immediately after euthanasia, carefully stripped of mesenteric fat and Peyer’s patches/cecal patch, sliced longitudinally and vigorously washed in cold HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS to remove all fecal traces. The tissue was cut into 1-inch fragments and placed in a 50ml conical containing 10ml of HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS and 1 mM of fresh DTT. The conical was placed in a bacterial shaker set to 37°C and 200rpm for 10 minutes. After 45 s of vigorously shaking the conical by hand, the tissue was moved to a fresh conical containing 10ml of HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS and 5 mM of EDTA. The conical was placed in a bacterial shaker set to 37°C and 200rpm for 10 minutes. After 45 s of vigorously shaking the conical by hand, the EDTA wash was repeated once more in order to completely remove epithelial cells. The tissue was minced and digested in 5-7ml of 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI containing collagenase (1 mg/ml collagenaseD; Roche), DNase I (100 μg/ml; Sigma), dispase (0.05 U/ml; Worthington) and subjected to constant shaking at 155rpm, 37°C for 35 min (small intestine) or 55 min (large intestine). Digested tissue was vigorously shaken by hand for 2 min before adding 2 volumes of media and subsequently passed through a 70 μm cell strainer. The tissue was spun down and resuspended in 40% buffered percoll solution, which was then aliquoted into a 15ml conical. An equal volume of 80% buffered percoll solution was underlaid to create a sharp interface. The tube was spun at 2200rpm for 22 min at 22°C to enrich for live mononuclear cells. Lamina propria (LP) lymphocytes were collected from the interface and washed once prior to staining.
For isolating mononuclear cells from spinal cords during EAE, spinal cords were mechanically disrupted and dissociated in RPMI containing collagenase (1 mg/ml collagenaseD; Roche), DNase I (100 μg/ml; Sigma) and 10% FBS at 37°C for 30 min. Leukocytes were collected at the interface of a 40%/80% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare).
For isolating mononuclear cells from lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes (for the SFB model), and draining lymph nodes (Inguinal, axillary, and brachial lymph nodes for the EAE model) were mechanically dissected and minced in RPMI containing 10% FBS and 25mM HEPES through 40uM strainer. Cells were collected for further analysis.
Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from donor mice by flushing the long bones. To generate Tpi1 WT / Tpi1 KO chimeric reconstituted mice, Tpi1 +/+ Cd4 Cre CD45.1/2 and Tpi1 f/f Cd4 Cre CD45.2/2 mice were used as donors. To generate Hif1a WT /Hif1a KO chimeric reconstituted mice, Hif1a +/+ Cd4 Cre CD45.1/2 and Hif1a f/f Cd4 Cre CD45.1/1 mice were used as donors. To generate Il23r het /Il23r KO chimeric reconstituted mice, Il23r Gfp/+ CD45.1/2 and Il23r Gfp/Gfp CD45.1/1 mice were used as donors. Red blood cells were lysed with ACK Lysing Buffer, and CD4/CD8 T cells were labeled with CD4/CD8 magnetic microbeads and depleted with a Miltenyi LD column. The remaining cells were resuspended in PBS for injection in at a 1:1 ratio (WT: KO). 4 × 10 6 cells were injected intravenously into 6 week old mice (CD45.1/1 in Tpi1 experiment; Rag1 −/− in Hif1a experiment) that were irradiated 4h before reconstitution using 1000 rads/mouse (2x500rads, at an interval of 3h, at X-RAD 320 X-Ray Irradiator). Peripheral blood samples were collected and analyzed by FACS 8 weeks later to check for reconstitution, after which SFB colonization or EAE induction were performed.
Pimonidazole HCl (hypoxyprobe) was retro orbitally injected into mice at the dose of 100mg/kg under general anesthesia (Ketamine 100mg/Kg, Xylazine 15mg/Kg). 3 h later, tissues were dissected and processed to get the mononuclear cell fraction. After surface/live/dead staining, cells were treated using the FoxP3 staining buffer set from eBioscience according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Intracellular staining with anti-RORγt, Foxp3, Tbet, and biotin-pimonidazole adduct antibodies were performed for 60min on ice in 1X eBioscience permwash buffer containing normal mouse IgG (50 μg/ml), and normal rat IgG (50 μg/ml). The pimonidazole labeling was visualized with streptavidin APC staining in the same buffer.
Two doses of EdU (50mg/kg for each) were i.p. injected into MOG/CFA-immunized mice in 12 h intervals at days 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12 post immunization. Draining lymph nodes and/or spinal cords were dissected 12 h post the second injection. Detection of EdU incorporation into the DNA was performed with EdU-click 647 Kit (Baseclick) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, surface-stained cells were fixed in 100 μL fixative solution, and permeabilized in 100 μL permeabilization buffer. Cells were pelleted and incubated for 30min in 220 μL EdU reaction mixture containing 20 μL permeabilization buffer, 20 μL buffer additive, 1 μL dye azide, 4 μL catalyst solution, and 175 μL dPBS, before 3x wash and FACS analysis.
Sorted naive 7B8 or 2D2 CD45.1/1 CD4 T cells were stained with CFSE cell proliferation kit (Life Technology). Labeled cells were administered into each congenic CD45.2/2 recipient mouse by retro-orbital injection. Mice receiving 7B8 cells were gavaged with SFB mono-feces twice on days −4 and −3. Mice receiving 2D2 cells were immunized for EAE induction immediately after cell transfer. mLNs of the SFB-colonized mice were collected at 72h and 120h, and dLN of 2D2-injected mice were collected at 72h, 96h and 120h post transfer for cell division analysis.
Total RNA from sorted target cell populations was isolated using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen) followed by DNase I (QIAGEN) treatment and cleanup with RNeasy Plus Micro kit (QIAGEN; 74034). RNA quality was assessed using Pico Bioanalyser chips (Agilent). RNASeq libraries were prepared using the Clontech Smart-Seq Ultra low RNA kit (Takara Bio) for cDNA preparation, starting with 550 pg of total RNA, and 13 cycles of PCR for cDNA amplification. The SMARTer Thruplex DNA-Seq kit (Takara Bio) was used for library prep, with 7 cycles of PCR amplification, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The amplified library was purified using AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter), quantified by Qubit and QPCR, and visualized in an Agilent Bioanalyzer. The libraries were pooled equimolarly, and run on a HiSeq 4000, as paired end reads, 50 nucleotides in length.
Libraries from isolated single cells were generated based on the Smart-seq2 protocol ( Picelli et al., 2014 67. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, A.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (2542) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following modifications. In brief, RNA from sorted single cells was used as template for oligo-dT primed reverse transcription with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher), and the cDNA library was generated by 20 cycle PCR amplification with IS PCR primer using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems) followed by Agencourt AMPure XP bead purification (Beckman Coulter) as described. Libraries were tagmented using the Nextera XT Library Prep kit (Illumina) with custom barcode adapters (sequences available upon request). Libraries with unique barcodes were combined and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 in RapidRun mode, with either 2x50 or 1x50 nt reads.
In vitro cultured np/pTh17 cells were collected at 96h, washed twice in glucose-free RPMI (ThermoFisher, 11879020) containing 10% dialyzed FBS (ThermoFisher), and re-plated in anti-hamster IgG-coated 96-well plates at 60,000/well in np/pTh17 medium (glucose-free RPMI containing 10% dialyzed FBS, 2mM β-mercaptoethanol, 4mM glutamine, anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and 4g/L isotype labeled glucose). For KA-treated samples, Olfr2 KO cells were previously treated with 30 μM KA before collection and re-plating. The re-plated cells were cultured in Th17 medium supplemented with 30 μM KA.
To measure relative PPP activity, 13 C 1,2 -glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added into the Th17 medium. Re-plated cells were further cultured 12 h before metabolite extraction and GC-MS analysis. After a brief wash with 0.9% ice-cold saline solution to remove media contamination, cellular metabolites were extracted using a pre-chilled methanol/water/chloroform extraction method, as previously described ( Metallo et al., 2011 48. Metallo, C.M. ∙ Gameiro, P.A. ∙ Bell, E.L. ... Reductive glutamine metabolism by IDH1 mediates lipogenesis under hypoxia Nature. 2011; 481 :380-384 Crossref Scopus (1397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aqueous and inorganic layers were separated by cold centrifugation for 15 min. The aqueous layer was transferred to sample vials (Agilent 5190-2243) and evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac (Savant Thermo SPD111V).
For lactate secretion analysis, re-plated cells were cultured in normoxia or hypoxia for 12 h. media was collected and centrifuged at 1,000 x g to pellet cellular debris. 5 μL of supernatant was extracted in 80% ice-cold methanol mixture containing isotope-labeled internal standards and evaporated to dryness.
Metabolite abundance [X m ] was determined using the following equation: [ 𝑋 𝑚 ] = 𝑋 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑑 − % 𝑀 ⁢ 0 𝑥 1 0 0 − % 𝑀 ⁢ 0 𝑥 where X std is the molar amount of isotope-labeled standard (e.g., 5 nmol lactate) and %M0 x is the relative abundance of unlabeled metabolite X corrected for natural isotope abundance.
To quantify the metabolite secretion flux (Flux m ), the molar change in extracellular metabolites was determined by calculating the difference between conditioned and fresh media and normalizing to changes in cell density: 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑥 𝑚 = 𝑋 𝑓 − 𝑋 𝑖 ∫ 𝑓 0 𝑋 0 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑡 where X f and X i are the final and initial molar amounts of metabolite, respectively, X 0 is the initial cell density, k is the exponential growth rate (hr -1 ), and t is the media conditioning time.
For kinetic flux profiling, npTh17 medium was supplemented with 4g/L 13 C 6 -glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Cells were collected at various time points. Unlabeled metabolite (M0) versus time (t) were plotted and the data were fitted to an equation as previously described ( Yuan et al., 2008 90. Yuan, J. ∙ Bennett, B.D. ∙ Rabinowitz, J.D. Kinetic flux profiling for quantitation of cellular metabolic fluxes Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3 :1328-1340 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ) to quantify the metabolite turnover rate (t -1 ): 𝑌 = ( 1 − 𝛼 ) ∗ ⁢ e x p ⁡ ( − 𝑘 ∗ ⁢ 𝑡 ) + 𝛼 where α is the percentage of unlabeled (M0) metabolite at steady-state, k is the metabolite turnover rate and t is time.
Metabolite flux was quantified by multiplying the decay rate by the intracellular metabolite abundance.
Metabolite derivatization using MOX-tBDMS was conducted as previously described ( Lewis et al., 2014 38. Lewis, C.A. ∙ Parker, S.J. ∙ Fiske, B.P. ... Tracing compartmentalized NADPH metabolism in the cytosol and mitochondria of mammalian cells Mol. Cell. 2014; 55 :253-263 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). Derivatized samples were analyzed by GC-MS using a DB-35MS column (30 m x 0.25mm i.d. x 0.25 μm) installed in an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (GC) interfaced with an Agilent 5977B mass spectrometer as previously described ( Grassian et al., 2014 19. Grassian, A.R. ∙ Parker, S.J. ∙ Davidson, S.M. ... IDH1 mutations alter citric acid cycle metabolism and increase dependence on oxidative mitochondrial metabolism Cancer Res. 2014; 74 :3317-3331 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ) and corrected for natural abundance using in-house algorithms adapted from ( Fernandez et al., 1996 16. Fernandez, C.A. ∙ Des Rosiers, C. ∙ Previs, S.F. ... Correction of 13C mass isotopomer distributions for natural stable isotope abundance J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31 :255-262 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ).
npTh17 cells were cultured in vitro in normoxic condition for 96 h before being collected and washed twice in glucose-free RPMI (ThermoFisher) containing 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), and re-plated in anti-hamster IgG-coated 96-well plates at 20,000/well in 200 μL npTh17 medium (glucose-free RPMI containing 10% dialyzed FBS, 2mM β-mercaptoethanol, 4mM glutamine, anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and 4g/L glucose). 12 hours later, cell numbers were determined in replicate wells, and ATP measurements were made using CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega) according to instructions.
For glucose consumption analysis, supernatants of npTh17 cells, or cell free control, were collected at 24h post cell re-plating. Metabolites were extracted for LC-MS analysis to measure glucose and lactate quantities. Glucose consumption rate and lactate production rate was quantified on a relative basis by calculating the ion count difference between conditioned and fresh media and normalizing to changes in cell density.
Samples were subjected to an LC-MS analysis to detect and quantify known peaks. A metabolite extraction was carried out on each sample with a previously described method ( Pacold et al., 2016 63. Pacold, M.E. ∙ Brimacombe, K.R. ∙ Chan, S.H. ... A PHGDH inhibitor reveals coordination of serine synthesis and one-carbon unit fate Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12 :452-458 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, samples were extracted by mixing 10 μL of sample with 490 μL of extraction buffer (81.63% methanol (Fisher Scientific) and 500 nM metabolomics amino acid mix standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.)) in 2.0mL screw cap vials containing ∼100 μL of disruption beads (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL). Each was homogenized for 10 cycles on a bead blaster homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific, Edison, NJ). Cycling consisted of a 30 s homogenization time at 6 m/s followed by a 30 s pause. Samples were subsequently spun at 21,000 g for 3 min at 4°C. A set volume of each (360 μL) was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and dried down by speedvac (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Samples were reconstituted in 40 μL of Optima LC/MS grade water (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Samples were sonicated for 2 mins, then spun at 21,000 g for 3min at 4°C. Twenty microliters were transferred to LC vials containing glass inserts for analysis.
The LC column was a MilliporeTM ZIC-pHILIC (2.1 x150 mm, 5 μm) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000TM system and the column oven temperature was set to 25 °C for the gradient elution. A flow rate of 100 μL/min was used with the following buffers; A) 10 mM ammonium carbonate in water, pH 9.0, and B) neat acetonitrile. The gradient profile was as follows; 80%–20%B (0-30 min), 20%–80%B (30-31 min), 80%–80%B (31-42 min). Injection volume was set to 1 μL for all analyses (42 min total run time per injection).
MS analyses were carried out by coupling the LC system to a Thermo Q Exactive HFTM mass spectrometer operating in heated electrospray ionization mode (HESI). Method duration was 30 min with a polarity switching data-dependent Top 5 method for both positive and negative modes. Spray voltage for both positive and negative modes was 3.5kV and capillary temperature was set to 320°C with a sheath gas rate of 35, aux gas of 10, and max spray current of 100 μA. The full MS scan for both polarities utilized 120,000 resolution with an AGC target of 3e6 and a maximum IT of 100 ms, and the scan range was from 67-1000 m/z. Tandem MS spectra for both positive and negative mode used a resolution of 15,000, AGC target of 1e5, maximum IT of 50 ms, isolation window of 0.4 m/z, isolation offset of 0.1 m/z, fixed first mass of 50 m/z, and 3- way multiplexed normalized collision energies (nCE) of 10, 35, 80. The minimum AGC target was 1e4 with an intensity threshold of 2e5. All data were acquired in profile mode.
OCR and ECAR measurements were performed using a Seahorse XFe96 analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences). Seahorse XFe96 plates were coated with 0.56ug Cell-Tak (Corning) in 24 μL coating buffer (8 μL H 2 O + 16 μL 0.1M NaHCO 3 (PH 8.0)) overnight at 4 °C, and washed 3x with H 2 O before use. In vitro cultured Th17 cells were collected at 96 h, washed twice in Seahorse RPMI media PH7.4 (Agilent, 103576-100) and seeded onto the coated plates at 100,000 per well. To measure the OCR and ECAR of KA-treated cells, 30 μM KA (Santa Cruz) was added into Olfr2 control Th17 cell samples at the beginning of the Seahorse measurement. Respiratory rates were measured in RPMI Seahorse media, pH7.4 (Agilent) supplemented with 10 mM glucose (Agilent) and 2 mM glutamine (Agilent) in response to sequential injections of oligomycin (1 μM), FCCP (0.5 μM) and antimycin/rotenone (1 μM) (all Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Whole cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by wet transfer for 4 h on ice at 60 V. Blots were blocked in TBS blocking buffer (Li-Cor) and then stained overnight with primary antibody at 4°C. The next day, membranes were washed three times in TBST (TBS and 0.1% Tween-20), stained with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies (Li-Cor) at 1:10,000 dilution in TBS blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and then imaged in the 680- and 800-nm channels. Antibodies used: Gapdh (CST), Gpi1 (Thermo Fisher), Ldha (CST), Pdha1 (Abcam), Tpi1 (Abcam), G6pdx (Abcam), α-tubulin (Santa Cruz).
Raw reads from bulk RNA-seq were aligned to the mm10 genome using STAR v 2.6.1d with the quantmode parameter to get read counts. DESeq2 v 1.22.2 was used for differential expression analysis. Heatmaps were produced using gplots v 3.0.1.1.
The single cell RNA raw sequence reads were aligned to the UCSC Mus musculus genome, mm10, using Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 7. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (5208) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mean number of reads per cell was 241,500. Gene expression values were quantified into Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM). We removed cells which had fewer than 800 detected genes or more than 3,000 genes. After filtering, the mean number of detected genes per cell were 1,765. Then, for the SFB and EAE dataset, we normalized the gene matrix by SCTransform ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 20. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (1792) PubMed Google Scholar ) regression with percent of mitochondria reads separately.
To visualize the EAE and SFB data, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and further reduced PCA dimensions into two dimensional space using UMAP ( Becht et al., 2018 4. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; Published online December 3, 2018 Crossref Scopus (2578) PubMed Google Scholar ; McInnes and Healy, 2018 46. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2018; arXiv:abs/1802.03426 Google Scholar ). UMAP matrix was also used to build the weighted shared nearest neighbor graph and clustering of single cells was performed by the original Louvain algorithm. All the above analysis was performed using Seurat v3 R package ( Butler et al., 2018 9. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6227) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stuart et al., 2019 77. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7328) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we noticed there was one cluster of cells with a much lower number of features in which over 60% of cells had fewer features than the average. Thus, it was removed from the analysis.
A table of average gene expression for each cluster, and a table of log2 Fold Change values with p values between each sample were calculated with Seurat. Seurat calculates differential expression based on the non-parameteric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Log fold change is calculated using the average expression between two groups. These values were used in Figures S1 J and S1K. with IPA for a pathway analysis, and in Figure S1 L to make volcano plots.
Differences between groups were calculated using the unpaired two-sided Welch’s t test. Difference between two groups of co-transferred cells, or in bone marrow chimera experiments, were calculated using the paired two-tailed t test. Differences between EAE clinical score was calculated using two-way ANOVA for repeated-measures with Bonferroni correction. For RNA-seq analysis, differential expression was tested by DESeq2 by use of a negative binomial generalized linear model. We treated less than 0.05 of p value as significant differences. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001. Details regarding number of replicates and the definition of center/error bars can be found in figure legends.
