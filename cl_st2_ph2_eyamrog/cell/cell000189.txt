Title: A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress


Abstract: Summary

Metazoan organisms rely on conserved stress response pathways to alleviate adverse conditions and preserve cellular integrity. Stress responses are particularly important in stem cells that provide lifetime support for tissue formation and repair, but how these protective systems are integrated into developmental programs is poorly understood. Here we used myoblast differentiation to identify the E3 ligase CUL2 FEM1B and its substrate FNIP1 as core components of the reductive stress response. Reductive stress, as caused by prolonged antioxidant signaling or mitochondrial inactivity, reverts the oxidation of invariant Cys residues in FNIP1 and allows CUL2 FEM1B to recognize its target. The ensuing proteasomal degradation of FNIP1 restores mitochondrial activity to preserve redox homeostasis and stem cell integrity. The reductive stress response is therefore built around a ubiquitin-dependent rheostat that tunes mitochondrial activity to redox needs and implicates metabolic control in coordination of stress and developmental signaling.

Section: Introduction

Metazoan development relies on carefully balanced transcriptional networks to generate the more than 200 cell types of an adult organism. Stem cells are at the apex of this intricate program, and their defective homeostasis gives rise to many pediatric diseases ( Avior et al., 2016 3. Avior, Y. ∙ Sagi, I. ∙ Benvenisty, N. Pluripotent stem cells in disease modelling and drug discovery Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 :170-182 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nusse and Clevers, 2017 63. Nusse, R. ∙ Clevers, H. Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling, Disease, and Emerging Therapeutic Modalities Cell. 2017; 169 :985-999 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (927) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because pluripotent cells also support tissue repair, their aberrant maintenance has been linked to tumorigenesis and tissue degeneration ( Almada and Wagers, 2016 1. Almada, A.E. ∙ Wagers, A.J. Molecular circuitry of stem cell fate in skeletal muscle regeneration, ageing and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 :267-279 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To protect their stem cell populations from damage, organisms possess conserved stress response pathways that detect and alleviate a wide range of adverse conditions. Many stem cells reside in hypoxic niches and rely on glycolysis as a main source of energy, which limits oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, or proteins ( Donato et al., 2017 29. Donato, V. ∙ Bonora, M. ∙ Simoneschi, D. ... The TDH-GCN5L1-Fbxo15-KBP axis limits mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse embryonic stem cells Nat.

Neurosci. 2000; 20 :7377-7383 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). If too many reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate, these cells activate the oxidative stress response to stabilize the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). NRF2 drives expression of proteins that scavenge oxidizing molecules and revert oxidized proteins into their functional reduced state ( Suzuki and Yamamoto, 2017 87. Suzuki, T. ∙ Yamamoto, M.

Chem. 2017; 292 :16817-16824 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Failure to elicit antioxidant signaling impairs stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and endangers tissue maintenance ( Tsai et al., 2013 88. Tsai, J.J. ∙ Dudakov, J.A. ∙ Takahashi, K. ...

Rev. 2018; 98 :1169-1203 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stem cell integrity is similarly preserved by stress responses that are activated by protein misfolding, DNA damage, or lack of oxygen ( Balchin et al., 2016 7.

Mirroring their rapid activation, stress responses have to be shut off soon after cellular homeostasis has been restored. Stem cells that do not turn off the oxidative stress response fail to accumulate physiological ROS required for signaling and are unable to differentiate ( Bellezza et al., 2018 10.

Despite such dire consequences, how reductive stress is sensed and alleviated is still unknown.
Stress responses are often controlled by ubiquitylation, a modification whose specificity is imparted by hundreds of E3 ligases ( Balchin et al., 2016 7. Balchin, D. ∙ Hayer-Hartl, M. ∙ Hartl, F.U.

The increasing complexity of the ubiquitin code Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :579-586 Crossref Scopus (593) PubMed Google Scholar ). Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) pairs up with Cullin-3 (CUL3) and RBX1 to form the E3 CUL3 KEAP1 , which sequesters and ubiquitylates NRF2 ( Wakabayashi et al., 2003 92.

Genet. 2003; 35 :238-245 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ). When cells experience oxidative stress, CUL3 KEAP1 is inhibited, and NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus to drive antioxidant gene expression ( Furukawa and Xiong, 2005 32. Furukawa, M. ∙ Xiong, Y.

Biol. 2004; 24 :10941-10953 Crossref Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ). The E3 CUL2 VHL similarly restricts HIF-1α until hypoxic stress stabilizes this transcription factor to initiate angiogenesis ( Denko, 2008 26. Denko, N.C. Hypoxia, HIF1 and glucose metabolism in the solid tumour Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8 :705-713 Crossref Scopus (965) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaelin, 2007 49. Kaelin, W.G. Von Hippel-Lindau disease Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2007; 2 :145-173 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ). Underscoring the importance of accurate stress signaling, deletion of VHL or KEAP1 elicits embryonic or early postnatal death, respectively ( Gnarra et al., 1997 34. Gnarra, J.R. ∙ Ward, J.M. ∙ Porter, F.D. ... Defective placental vasculogenesis causes embryonic lethality in VHL-deficient mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94 :9102-9107 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wakabayashi et al., 2003 92. Wakabayashi, N. ∙ Itoh, K. ∙ Wakabayashi, J. ... Keap1-null mutation leads to postnatal lethality due to constitutive Nrf2 activation Nat. Genet. 2003; 35 :238-245 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ), and their mutation is a frequent cause of cancer ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012 22. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive genomic characterization of squamous cell lung cancers Nature. 2012; 489 :519-525 Crossref Scopus (2220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaelin, 2007 49. Kaelin, W.G. Von Hippel-Lindau disease Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2007; 2 :145-173 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether reductive stress is also controlled by a ubiquitin-dependent stress response and whether this is important for development has not been investigated.
Here we made use of the redox-sensitive pathways underlying myoblast differentiation to identify CUL2 FEM1B and its target Folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1) as core components of the reductive stress response. Reductive stress as a consequence of persistent mitochondrial inactivity or antioxidant signaling reverses oxidation of invariant Cys residues in FNIP1, a prerequisite for CUL2 FEM1B to bind its substrate. The ensuing ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of FNIP1 increase mitochondrial output to generate ROS and preserve redox homeostasis. The reductive stress response is therefore built around a ubiquitin-dependent rheostat that tunes mitochondrial output to cellular needs and couples stress and developmental signaling in vertebrates.

As a tissue reliant on oxygen consumption, muscle provides a system to identify proteins with roles in redox stress management ( Almada and Wagers, 2016 1. Almada, A.E. ∙ Wagers, A.J.

This prompted us to ask whether Cullin-Ring-E3 ligases (CRLs), a family of E3s known to control stress and developmental signaling ( Bellezza et al., 2018 10.

We depleted each of seven Cullin scaffolds from C2C12 myoblasts and followed myotube formation by staining for myosin heavy chain (MyHC) ( Bader et al., 1982 6. Bader, D. ∙ Masaki, T. ∙ Fischman, D.A. Immunochemical analysis of myosin heavy chain during avian myogenesis in vivo and in vitro J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95 :763-770 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These experiments showed that CUL2 and CUL3 were particularly important for myotube formation ( Figure S1 A), which is consistent with the effects of CUL3 deletion on muscle development in mice ( Blondelle et al., 2017 15.

CUL2 and CUL3 select their substrates through adaptors containing VHL boxes or BTB domains ( Silverman et al., 2012 80. Silverman, J.S. ∙ Skaar, J.R. ∙ Pagano, M.

Using affinity purification of CUL2 and CUL3 coupled to mass spectrometry, we detected 19 CUL2 and 32 CUL3 adaptors in myoblasts or myotubes ( Table S1 ). This included candidate adaptors, such as the muscular dystrophy protein myoferlin, and factors linked to familial myopathy, such as KLHL9. After combining this list with adaptors from other cell types ( Bennett et al., 2010 12. Bennett, E.J. ∙ Rush, J. ∙ Gygi, S.P. ...

Dimerization quality control ensures neuronal development and survival Science. 2018; 362 :eaap8236 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), we depleted 156 CRL2 and CRL3 subunits from myoblasts, initiated differentiation, and recorded MyHC-positive myotubes by microscopy and automated image analysis ( Figure 1 A). Critical phenotypes were confirmed with multiple small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to eliminate the risk of off-target effects.
Our screen revealed that the CUL3 adaptors KEAP1, BTBD9, KLHL22, and ANKFY1 were required for myotube formation, whereas depletion of the CUL2 adaptor fem-1 homolog B (FEM1B) strongly improved this differentiation program ( Figures 1 A–1C). Because loss of these adaptors minimally affected cell numbers ( Figure S1 B), aberrant cell division or survival was unlikely to account for the changes in cell fate specification. Notably, all adaptors required for myotube formation had links to disease; mutations in KEAP1 lead to lung and renal cancer ( Kovac et al., 2015 52. Kovac, M. ∙ Navas, C. ∙ Horswell, S. ...

Nephrol. 2018; 29 :2123-2138 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We were intrigued to see that depletion of the oxidative stress sensor KEAP1 prevented myoblast differentiation. Although oxidative stress transiently inhibits CUL3 KEAP1 ( Zhang et al., 2004 104. Zhang, D.D. ∙ Lo, S.C. ∙ Cross, J.V. ... Keap1 is a redox-regulated substrate adaptor protein for a Cul3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complex Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24 :10941-10953 Crossref Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ), genetic loss of KEAP1 stabilizes NRF2 for prolonged periods of time and elicits reductive stress ( Rajasekaran et al., 2011 71. Rajasekaran, N.S. ∙ Varadharaj, S. ∙ Khanderao, G.D. ... Sustained activation of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element signaling promotes reductive stress in the human mutant protein aggregation cardiomyopathy in mice Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14 :957-971 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). KEAP1 depletion in myoblasts induced accumulation of NRF2 ( Figures 1 C and 1D) and its target genes ( Figures 2 E and 2F). This caused an increase in NADPH levels ( Figure S1 C) and a steep drop in ROS, the hallmark of reductive stress ( Figure 1 E). When we blunted such antioxidant signaling by co-depleting NRF2 or enzymes of glutathione synthesis and recycling, differentiation was restored ( Figures 1 D and 1F; Figure S1 D). Scavengers of mitochondrion-derived ROS, which impose reductive stress by chemical means ( Banba et al., 2019 8. Banba, A. ∙ Tsuji, A. ∙ Kimura, H. ...

Biol. 2015; 11 :834-836 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ), also inhibited myoblast differentiation ( Figure 1 G). We therefore conclude that, consistent with recent findings using KEAP1 inhibitors ( Rajasekaran et al., 2020 72. Rajasekaran, N.S. ∙ Shelar, S.B. ∙ Jones, D.P. ... Reductive stress impairs myogenic differentiation Redox Biol. 2020; 34 :101492 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), reductive stress impairs myogenesis in vitro . Although this lent support to the notion that ROS fulfill critical signaling roles ( Holmström and Finkel, 2014 42. Holmström, K.M. ∙ Finkel, T. Cellular mechanisms and physiological consequences of redox-dependent signalling Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 :411-421 Crossref Scopus (856) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sena and Chandel, 2012 79. Sena, L.A. ∙ Chandel, N.S. Physiological roles of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species Mol. Cell. 2012; 48 :158-167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1228) PubMed Google Scholar ), it reinforced the question of how reductive stress is sensed and counteracted during normal development.
To dissect cellular responses to reductive stress, we designed a genetic modifier screen aimed at rescuing differentiation of KEAP1-deficient myoblasts. Focusing on E3 ligases as likely stress regulators, we found that depletion of the CUL2 adaptor FEM1B enabled myotube formation despite lack of KEAP1 ( Figure 2 A). We confirmed this result with independent siRNAs in microscopy and western blot analyses of myoblast differentiation ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Loss of FEM1B also rescued differentiation in the presence of scavengers of mitochondrion-derived ROS, showing that FEM1B affects reductive stress imposed by genetic or chemical means ( Figure 2 D). Intriguingly, FEM1B had already emerged from our initial screen as hit whose depletion showed the strongest increase in efficiency of myotube formation ( Figure 1 A), the opposite phenotype of loss of KEAP1.
Gene expression analyses showed that KEAP1 depletion induced antioxidant NRF2 targets, such as enzymes of glutathione synthesis, ROS scavengers, or components of the pentose phosphate pathway ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Figures S2 A and S2B). Depletion of FEM1B had the opposite effect and reduced NRF2 targets but increased the myogenic markers MYOG and MYL1 ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Importantly, concomitant depletion of KEAP1 and FEM1B cancelled each of these phenotypes of single E3 ligase depletion ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Figure S2 A). Consistent with these results, depletion of FEM1B restored ROS levels in KEAP1-deficient myoblasts ( Figure 1 E).
Although KEAP1 is best known for controlling NRF2 levels; it also sequesters the transcription factor in the cytoplasm ( Itoh et al., 2003 45. Itoh, K. ∙ Wakabayashi, N. ∙ Katoh, Y. ... Keap1 regulates both cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling and degradation of Nrf2 in response to electrophiles Genes Cells. 2003; 8 :379-391 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although FEM1B depletion reduced NRF2 mRNA ( Figure S2 C), it had only a minor effect on the abundance of the NRF2 protein ( Figure 2 C). In contrast, loss of FEM1B had striking effects on NRF2 localization; although NRF2 accumulated in the nucleus of KEAP1-deficient myoblasts, co-depletion of FEM1B directed NRF2 to perinuclear regions, where it cannot induce gene expression ( Figure 2 G). Our results therefore identified FEM1B as a critical regulator of redox signaling and raised the possibility that the E3 CUL2 FEM1B might affect, directly or indirectly, the reductive stress response.

Mutation of the respective FEM1B residue, Leu597, produced an adaptor that failed to bind CUL2 and, hence, cannot support ubiquitylation ( Figure S2 D) but contained ankyrin repeats and should thus retain its ability to recognize substrates. As seen with other CRLs ( Mena et al., 2018 61. Mena, E.L. ∙ Kjolby, R.A.S. ∙ Saxton, R.A. ... Dimerization quality control ensures neuronal development and survival Science. 2018; 362 :eaap8236 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), we expected FEM1B L597A to show prolonged binding to otherwise short-lived targets to facilitate their identification by CompPASS mass spectrometry ( Huttlin et al., 2017 44.

Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks Nature. 2017; 545 :505-509 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Proteomics analyses confirmed that FEM1B L597A was impaired in binding to CUL2, Elongin B, and Elongin C ( Figure 3 A). In contrast, FEM1B L597A interacted more strongly than FEM1B with several proteins considered to be candidate substrates. These included the GATOR1 complex, which inhibits mTORC1 signaling during amino acid limitation ( Bar-Peled et al., 2013 9. Bar-Peled, L. ∙ Chantranupong, L. ∙ Cherniack, A.D. ...

Loss of a Negative Regulator of mTORC1 Induces Aerobic Glycolysis and Altered Fiber Composition in Skeletal Muscle Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :1907-1914 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as Folliculin (FLCN) and FNIP1, which also bind each other ( Baba et al., 2006 4. Baba, M. ∙ Hong, S.B. ∙ Sharma, N. ... Folliculin encoded by the BHD gene interacts with a binding protein, FNIP1, and AMPK, and is involved in AMPK and mTOR signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :15552-15557 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ). A close FNIP1 homolog, FNIP2, was not detected. We confirmed, by immunoprecipitation and western blotting, that FEM1B associated with GATOR1, FLCN, and FNIP1 in a manner that was stabilized by mutation of the VHL box in FEM1B ( Figure 3 B; Figure S2 E). In contrast, mutation of Cys186, an invariant residue in the substrate-binding ankyrin repeats, strongly diminished recognition of GATOR1, FLCN, and FNIP1 by FEM1B ( Figure 3 B).
FEM1B overexpression elicited CUL2- and proteasome-dependent degradation of FNIP1, whereas substrate binding-deficient FEM1B C186S , inactive FEM1B L597A , or the related adaptor FEM1A did not have this effect ( Figure 3 C; Figures S2 E and S2F). Depletion of FEM1B caused the opposite outcome and increased levels of endogenous FNIP1 ( Figure 3 D). NEDD8-modified CUL2 FEM1B also polyubiquitylated FNIP1 in vitro when incubated with the E2 enzymes UBE2D3 and UBE2R1 ( Figure 3 E). In contrast, expression of FEM1B did not induce degradation of FLCN, GATOR1 subunits, or FNIP2 ( Figure 3 B; Figures S2 E–S2G), and CUL2 FEM1B did not ubiquitylate these proteins in vitro ( Figure 3 E; Figure S2 H). We conclude that FNIP1 is a proteolytic CUL2 FEM1B substrate, whereas FLCN or GATOR1 might interact with FEM1B indirectly or in a role that is distinct from being a degradation target.
Although loss of FNIP1 had little effect on differentiation ( Figure S2 I), FNIP1, but not GATOR1, co-depletion reverted the effects of FEM1B loss on myotube formation ( Figure 3 F; Figures S2 I and S2J). Thus, accumulation of FNIP1 promoted differentiation in the absence of FEM1B. Loss of FNIP1 also prevented myogenesis in cells lacking both FEM1B and KEAP1 ( Figure 3 G) and caused NRF2 to re-enter the nucleus ( Figure 3 H), which documents that it was FNIP1 stabilization that allowed myoblasts to bypass reductive stress.
We conclude that FNIP1 is a critical target of CUL2 FEM1B during reductive stress. Previous work implicated FNIP1 in mitochondrial biogenesis ( Hasumi et al., 2012 39.

To determine whether ROS modulates recognition of FNIP1 by CUL2 FEM1B , we first needed to identify the FNIP1 degron that is bound by FEM1B. Through deletion analyses, we found a short stretch in the central region of FNIP1 that was required for recognition by CUL2 FEM1B and its proteasomal degradation ( Figures 4 A and 4B). As expected for a transferable motif, a degron fusion to GFP (GFP degron ) was readily detected by CUL2 FEM1B ( Figures S3 A and S3B). As with full-length FNIP1, GFP degron showed stronger binding to the substrate trap FEM1B L597A ( Figure S3 A), but it did not interact with FEM1B C186S ( Figure S3 B). We next expressed GFP degron along with mCherry and used the GFP/mCherry ratio as a quantitative readout for protein degradation. FEM1B, but not FEM1B L597A or FEM1B C186S , triggered dramatic loss of GFP degron ( Figure 4 C), whereas deletion of FEM1B by CRISPR-Cas9, depletion of FEM1B by shRNAs, or proteasome inhibition protected GFP degron from degradation ( Figure 4 D; Figures S3 C and S3D). The FNIP1 degron also mediated a robust interaction with recombinant FEM1B as well as ubiquitylation by CUL2 FEM1B ( Figures 4 E and 4F). A central degron is therefore required and sufficient for FNIP1 ubiquitylation and degradation through CUL2 FEM1B . Although this degron is conserved among FNIP1 homologs ( Figure S3 E), it is not found in the closely related FNIP2, which is not recognized by CUL2 FEM1B ( Figure S3 F).
Given the role of CUL2 FEM1B in reductive stress signaling, we were excited to see that the FNIP1 degron contained three invariant Cys residues ( Figure S3 E). Cys585 was essential for FEM1B-dependent degradation of GFP degron ( Figure 5 A). Simultaneous mutation of Cys580 and Cys582 strongly impaired clearance of GFP degron , and mutation of all Cys residues fully protected the reporter against CUL2 FEM1B -dependent degradation ( Figure 5 A). Mutating its Cys residues blocked binding of the degron to recombinant FEM1B ( Figure 5 B) and prevented its ubiquitylation by CUL2 FEM1B ( Figure 5 C). The reliance on Cys residues was even more pronounced in full-length FNIP1, where each of the three Cys as well as a neighboring His residue were required for FEM1B binding and proteasomal degradation ( Figure 5 D; Figure S4 A).
In line with this mutational analysis, treatment of the FNIP1 degron with Cys-modifying iodoacetamide or N-ethylmaleimide inhibited its recognition by FEM1B ( Figure 5 E; Figures S4 B and S4C) and its CUL2 FEM1B -dependent ubiquitylation ( Figure 5 F). Similar observations were made in cells, where the iodoacetamide derivative IA-Alkyne impaired FEM1B-dependent degradation of GFP degron ( Figure 5 G). We conclude that the reductive stress E3 ligase CUL2 FEM1B relies on an unmodified Cys degron to detect its essential substrate FNIP1.
Given the role of Cys residues in CUL2 FEM1B recognition, we next determined the oxidation state of the FNIP1 degron during normal conditions and reductive stress. Despite treating FNIP1 immunoprecipitates with multiple proteases or even using synthesized peptides, we could not detect the entire degron by proteomic means. This peptide was also absent from global analyses of Cys oxidation, suggesting that it evades analysis by mass spectrometry ( Leichert et al., 2008 55. Leichert, L.I. ∙ Gehrke, F. ∙ Gudiseva, H.V. ... Quantifying changes in the thiol redox proteome upon oxidative stress in vivo Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :8197-8202 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ; Souza et al., 2018 83. Souza, R.W.A. ∙ Alves, C.R.R. ∙ Medeiros, A. ...

Proteome-wide analysis of cysteine oxidation reveals metabolic sensitivity to redox stress Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1581 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Selective derivatization was hampered by 30 additional Cys residues in FNIP1. However, because the degron was prone to disulfide bond formation ( Figure S5 A), we could analyze its oxidation using the thioredoxin TRX ( Lindahl and Florencio, 2003 57. Lindahl, M. ∙ Florencio, F.J. Thioredoxin-linked processes in cyanobacteria are as numerous as in chloroplasts, but targets are different Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :16107-16112 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). TRX contains an active site Cys residue that attacks intracellular disulfide bonds before a second TRX Cys targets the mixed disulfide to release a reduced protein. A TRX C35S variant lacking the second Cys fails to resolve the mixed disulfide and covalently traps oxidized proteins; the more a protein is trapped by TRX C35S , the more it is oxidized in cells.
Revealing significant degron oxidation under normal conditions, we found that GFP degron , but not the Cys-free reporter, was efficiently trapped by TRX C35S ( Figure 6 A). Treatment with α-ketoglutarate, which escalates ROS by increasing flux through the mitochondrial TCA cycle, or antimycin A, which elevates ROS by inhibiting mitochondrial complex III, enhanced TRX C35S trapping of GFP degron or full-length FNIP1 ( Figure 6 B; Figure S5 B). Importantly, ROS depletion after CUL3 KEAP1 inhibition shielded the degron from TRX C35S , which documented a reversal of degron oxidation during reductive stress ( Figure 6 C).
Several observations showed that degron oxidation controls FNIP1 recognition by CUL2 FEM1B . Even brief incubation of the degron without a reducing agent disrupted its binding to FEM1B, which was restored by Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) ( Figure 6 D). In cells, treatment with α-ketoglutarate or antimycin A stabilized GFP degron ( Figures 6 E and 6F; Figure S5 C), dependent on ROS produced by the respiratory chain ( Figure S5 C). Similar observations were made for myxothiazol, which increased ROS and stabilized GFP degron ( Figures S5 D and S5E), and for loss of the antioxidant enzymes GSR and TXRND1 ( Figure S5 F). Conversely, conditions that evoked reductive stress, as mitochondrial inactivation through glutamine starvation or CUL3 KEAP1 inhibition, accelerated GFP degron turnover ( Figure 6 F; Figure S5 G).
Extending these results to full-length proteins, antimycin A reduced binding of FNIP1 to FEM1B, but reductive stress strongly promoted this interaction ( Figure 6 G). In fact, when FEM1B and FNIP1 were present at endogenous levels, we could detect their association only after reductive stress had been imposed by CUL3 KEAP1 inhibition ( Figure 6 H). Reductive stress also lowered the protein levels but increased ubiquitylation of endogenous FNIP1 ( Figure 6 I). We conclude that reductive stress reverses oxidation of Cys residues in the FNIP1 degron and allows CUL2 FEM1B to associate with its substrate. These findings identify the FNIP1 degron as a reductive stress sensor that is read out by CUL2 FEM1B .
We speculated that FNIP1 degradation might modulate the activities of AMPK or mTORC1 ( Baba et al., 2006 4. Baba, M. ∙ Hong, S.B. ∙ Sharma, N. ...

Hasumi, H. ∙ Baba, M. ∙ Hasumi, Y. ... Regulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism by tumor suppressor FLCN J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2012; 104 :1750-1764 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tsun et al., 2013 89. Tsun, Z.Y. ∙ Bar-Peled, L. ∙ Chantranupong, L. ... The folliculin tumor suppressor is a GAP for the RagC/D GTPases that signal amino acid levels to mTORC1 Mol. Cell. 2013; 52 :495-505 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ) because these kinases control biogenesis of mitochondria, which produce most cellular ROS. However, although loss of FEM1B slightly improved amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 in myoblasts, this was stimulated, rather than decreased, by FNIP1 co-depletion ( Figure S6 A). The minor increase in AMPK activity caused by lack of FEM1B was also unaffected by FNIP1 co-depletion ( Figure S6 B). Furthermore, mutation of its degron did not affect binding of FNIP1 to AMPK or regulators of mTORC1 ( Figure S6 C), which indicated that FNIP1 stability did not affect mTORC1 or AMPK signaling in myoblasts.
Alternatively, FNIP1 stability might directly affect mitochondria. Indeed, although FEM1B depletion did not reduce mitochondrial content ( Figure S6 D), all mitochondria of FEM1B-deficient cells showed a heavily stained matrix in transmission electron microscopy ( Figure 7 Ab). Mitochondria in FEM1B-depleted cells thus undergo matrix condensation, which been ascribed to a lack of substrate for oxidative phosphorylation ( Hackenbrock, 1966 37. Hackenbrock, C.R. Ultrastructural bases for metabolically linked mechanical activity in mitochondria. I. Reversible ultrastructural changes with change in metabolic steady state in isolated liver mitochondria J. Cell Biol. 1966; 30 :269-297 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Many mitochondria also displayed onion-like swirling of cristae ( Figure 7 Ac), indicative of upregulation of respiratory chain components in response to impaired oxidative phosphorylation ( Jiang et al., 2017 46. Jiang, Y.F. ∙ Lin, S.S. ∙ Chen, J.M. ... Electron tomographic analysis reveals ultrastructural features of mitochondrial cristae architecture which reflect energetic state and aging Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :45474 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Walker and Benzer, 2004 93. Walker, D.W. ∙ Benzer, S. Mitochondrial “swirls” induced by oxygen stress and in the Drosophila mutant hyperswirl Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :10290-10295 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and some mitochondria contained large blebs ( Figure 7 Ad), as observed upon initiation of mitophagy ( Jin et al., 2010 47. Jin, S.M. ∙ Lazarou, M. ∙ Wang, C. ... Mitochondrial membrane potential regulates PINK1 import and proteolytic destabilization by PARL J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191 :933-942 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pickles et al., 2018 68. Pickles, S. ∙ Vigié, P. ∙ Youle, R.J. Mitophagy and Quality Control Mechanisms in Mitochondrial Maintenance Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :R170-R185 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (260) PubMed Google Scholar ). These phenotypes were rescued by FNIP1 co-depletion ( Figure 7 Af), showing that FNIP1 stabilization altered mitochondrial morphology, consistent with reduced oxidative phosphorylation.
In line with these findings, FEM1B depletion reduced, but loss of FNIP1 increased, the mitochondrial membrane potential ( Figure 7 B). Cells lacking FEM1B also contained a fragmented mitochondrial network clustered around the nucleus ( Figure 7 C) and did not produce mitochondrial ROS ( Figure 7 D). These phenotypes were rescued by FNIP1 depletion ( Figures 7 B–7D), showing that FNIP1 stabilization inhibits, but its degradation through CUL2 FEM1B increases, mitochondrial output to produce ROS and counteract reductive stress.
How could cytoplasmic FNIP1 degradation improve mitochondrial activity? Mitochondria harbor enzymes for fatty acid β-oxidation and the TCA cycle, which convert acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) into substrate for oxidative phosphorylation and building blocks for amino acid synthesis. To fuel these reactions, mitochondria import pyruvate, fatty acids, or TCA cycle intermediates, coupling cytoplasmic metabolism with mitochondrial energy production.
We thus wanted to find out whether FNIP1 stability affected glycolysis as a major source of pyruvate. FEM1B depletion reduced the glycolytic rate of myoblasts, whereas the respiratory chain itself was unaffected, as monitored by the oxygen consumption rate ( Figures S7 A and S7B). The extracellular acidification rate, which reflects secretion of lactate downstream of pyruvate, was also lowered by loss of FEM1B ( Figure S7 C). Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry revealed that loss of FEM1B depleted cells of glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates ( Figure 7 E; Figure S7 D). In addition, lack of FEM1B reduced the levels of glucose ( Figure 7 E) as well as glucose uptake ( Figure S7 E). However, only a few glycolytic intermediates increased, and glucose import was only improved mildly, upon FNIP1 co-depletion ( Figure S7 E). Mass spectrometry experiments showed that myoblasts derive few TCA cycle intermediates from glucose ( Figure S7 F), and the flux of glucose carbon atoms to the TCA cycle was unaffected by FEM1B depletion ( Figure S7 G). Co-depletion of glucose-utilizing enzymes also did not restore differentiation during reductive stress ( Figure S7 H). Thus, although FEM1B affects glucose metabolism, this likely involves a substrate distinct from FNIP1.
We noted that myoblasts derive most TCA cycle intermediates from glutamine ( Figure S7 F), which is converted into glutamate prior to its import into mitochondria. Metabolomics analyses found that FEM1B depletion decreased glutamate levels, whereas loss of FNIP1 increased its abundance ( Figure 7 E). Co-depletion of FEM1B and FNIP1 cancelled these phenotypes. In a similar manner, precursors or components of other mitochondrial shuttles were increased by FNIP1 loss, decreased upon depletion of FEM1B, and unaltered in myoblasts lacking FEM1B and FNIP1. This included citrulline and ornithine, which replenish fumarate from arginine; the fatty acid carrier acetylcarnitine and its precursor panthothenate; and the NADH shuttle glycerol-3-phosphate ( Figure 7 E). Degradation of FNIP1 through CUL2 FEM1B therefore increases the availability of several metabolite shuttles, which could provide a means to jumpstart the TCA cycle and induce production of mitochondrion-derived ROS. We conclude that CUL2 FEM1B and FNIP1 not only sense but also alleviate reductive stress, identifying these proteins as a core module of the reductive stress response.

Although mitochondrial inactivity provides a physiological trigger for reductive stress, it is also elicited by inhibition of CUL3 KEAP1 and the ensuing accumulation of NRF2.

Thus, mechanisms must exist to detect and alleviate reductive stress.
Indeed, we identified CUL2 FEM1B and its target FNIP1 as core components of the reductive stress response. CUL2 FEM1B only binds FNIP1 if the oxidation of Cys residues in FNIP1 is reverted during reductive stress. CUL2 FEM1B then ubiquitylates FNIP1, which, in turn, activates mitochondria to counteract reductive stress ( Figure 7 F). We also found that CUL2 FEM1B is required for nuclear import of NRF2, which, paradoxically, should support antioxidant gene expression. We speculate that the ability of CUL2 FEM1B to license NRF2 nuclear import provides a safety mechanism during prolonged periods of FNIP1 degradation and mitochondrial activation. A similar dichotomy exists during oxidative stress, where NRF2 stabilization triggers antioxidant signaling and, likely with a delay, mitochondrial biogenesis ( Rojo de la Vega et al., 2018 77. Rojo de la Vega, M. ∙ Chapman, E. ∙ Zhang, D.D. NRF2 and the Hallmarks of Cancer Cancer Cell. 2018; 34 :21-43 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings highlight the importance of maintaining physiological ROS levels, which we now attribute to a redox rheostat that integrates oxidative and reductive stress responses.
Our findings suggest that FNIP1 degradation mainly acts as a mitochondrial gatekeeper. Stabilization of FNIP1 reduced mitochondrion-derived ROS and induced changes in mitochondrial morphology reminiscent of a lack of substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. Stable FNIP1 also depleted cells of metabolite shuttles, which reduced the levels of TCA cycle intermediates and dampened the reactions that generate substrate for the respiratory chain. FNIP1 stabilization could thus contribute to antioxidant defenses in cells with highly active mitochondria. FNIP1’s role as a mitochondrial inhibitor might also be related to its recruitment to damaged mitochondria prior to autophagy because compromised organelles need to be shut down to ensure cell survival ( Heo et al., 2018 40. Heo, J.M. ∙ Ordureau, A. ∙ Swarup, S. ... RAB7A phosphorylation by TBK1 promotes mitophagy via the PINK-PARKIN pathway Sci. Adv. 2018; 4 :eaav0443 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Importantly, reductive stress through its hallmark absence of ROS reduces the Cys degron in FNIP1 and triggers proteasomal degradation of this mitochondrial gatekeeper. Loss of FNIP1 boosted levels of metabolite shuttles, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and restored mitochondrial activity in cells lacking FEM1B. These observations are congruent with phenotypes of FNIP1 deletion in mice, which causes a switch from glycolytic to oxidative myofibers, characterized by abundant mitochondria ( Reyes et al., 2015 74. Reyes, N.L. ∙ Banks, G.B. ∙ Tsang, M. ... Fnip1 regulates skeletal muscle fiber type specification, fatigue resistance, and susceptibility to muscular dystrophy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :424-429 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We conclude that FNIP1 degradation increases mitochondrial output to produce ROS and counteract reductive stress. CUL2 FEM1B and FNIP1 thus constitute a ubiquitin-dependent stress module that tunes mitochondrial output to the metabolic and redox needs of myoblasts ( Figure 7 F).
The reductive stress response bears striking similarity to pathways that respond to hypoxic and oxidative stress; these also rely on E3 ligases of the CRL family, which detect their substrates dependent on oxidation events. Although prolyl hydroxylation marks HIF1α for ubiquitylation by the hypoxic stress E3 CUL2 VHL ( Kaelin, 2007 49. Kaelin, W.G. Von Hippel-Lindau disease Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2007; 2 :145-173 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ohh et al., 2000 65. Ohh, M. ∙ Park, C.W. ∙ Ivan, M. ... Ubiquitination of hypoxia-inducible factor requires direct binding to the beta-domain of the von Hippel-Lindau protein Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2 :423-427 Crossref Scopus (1136) PubMed Google Scholar ), oxidation of Cys residues in KEAP1 prevents NRF2 ubiquitylation during oxidative stress ( Zhang et al., 2004 104. Zhang, D.D. ∙ Lo, S.C. ∙ Cross, J.V. ... Keap1 is a redox-regulated substrate adaptor protein for a Cul3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complex Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24 :10941-10953 Crossref Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ). It appears that cells evolved highly similar ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms to cope with different insults on redox homeostasis, which highlights the power of ubiquitylation to help cells adapt to rapidly changing environments.
Underscoring the importance of reductive stress signaling for tissue homeostasis, loss of FNIP1’s partner FLCN results in predisposition to renal cancer ( Baba et al., 2006 4. Baba, M. ∙ Hong, S.B. ∙ Sharma, N. ... Folliculin encoded by the BHD gene interacts with a binding protein, FNIP1, and AMPK, and is involved in AMPK and mTOR signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The same tumor type is caused by mutation of KEAP1 , CUL3 , NFE2L2 , or VHL ( Kaelin, 2007 49. Kaelin, W.G. Von Hippel-Lindau disease Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2007; 2 :145-173 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ; Singh et al., 2006 81. Singh, A. ∙ Misra, V. ∙ Thimmulappa, R.K. ... Dysfunctional KEAP1-NRF2 interaction in non-small-cell lung cancer PLoS Med. 2006; 3 :e420 Crossref Scopus (677) PubMed Google Scholar ) or aberrant oxidative metabolism ( Xu et al., 2019 101. Xu, J. ∙ Reznik, E. ∙ Lee, H.J. ... Abnormal oxidative metabolism in a quiet genomic background underlies clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma eLife. 2019; 8 :e38986 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Kidney cells might frequently fail to sustain the high ATP levels needed to filter toxic substrates out of blood ( Bhargava and Schnellmann, 2017 13. Bhargava, P. ∙ Schnellmann, R.G. Mitochondrial energetics in the kidney Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2017; 13 :629-646 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ), a condition that resembles reductive stress. In line with the importance of ATP production, redox stress pathways shape energy metabolism; HIF1α increases glycolysis, NRF2 elicits mitochondrial biogenesis ( Gonzalez et al., 2018 35. Gonzalez, F.J. ∙ Xie, C. ∙ Jiang, C. The role of hypoxia-inducible factors in metabolic diseases Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2018; 15 :21-32 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rojo de la Vega et al., 2018 77. Rojo de la Vega, M. ∙ Chapman, E. ∙ Zhang, D.D. NRF2 and the Hallmarks of Cancer Cancer Cell. 2018; 34 :21-43 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ), and FNIP1 tunes oxidative phosphorylation. Given the similar consequences of KEAP1 , FLCN , and VHL mutation and their overlapping functions, we propose that it is regulation of metabolism that integrates the stress and developmental roles of these stress response pathways.
Although FNIP1 is its critical substrate during reductive stress, CUL2 FEM1B also targets other proteins; CUL2 paired with FEM1A, FEM1B, or FEM1C ubiquitylates the histone mRNA-binding protein SLBP ( Dankert et al., 2017 25. Dankert, J.F. ∙ Pagan, J.K. ∙ Starostina, N.G. ... FEM1 proteins are ancient regulators of SLBP degradation Cell Cycle. 2017; 16 :556-564 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), and FEM-1 binds Gli transcription factors in worms ( Starostina et al., 2007 84. Starostina, N.G. ∙ Lim, J.M. ∙ Schvarzstein, M. ... A CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase containing three FEM proteins degrades TRA-1 to regulate C. elegans sex determination Dev. Cell. 2007; 13 :127-139 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). FEM1 proteins also act in the C-end rule pathway to eliminate proteins with carboxyl-terminal degrons or truncations ( Koren et al., 2018 51. Koren, I. ∙ Timms, R.T. ∙ Kula, T. ... The Eukaryotic Proteome Is Shaped by E3 Ubiquitin Ligases Targeting C-Terminal Degrons Cell. 2018; 173 :1622-1635.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because FEM1A does not bind FNIP1, it is likely that FEM1B detects these targets through a distinct site, potentially coordinating their degradation with redox regulation. We also found that CUL2 FEM1B binds, but does not polyubiquitylate, the mTORC1 inhibitor GATOR1 ( Bar-Peled et al., 2013 9. Bar-Peled, L. ∙ Chantranupong, L. ∙ Cherniack, A.D. ... A Tumor suppressor complex with GAP activity for the Rag GTPases that signal amino acid sufficiency to mTORC1 Science. 2013; 340 :1100-1106 Crossref Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dutchak et al., 2018 30. Dutchak, P.A. ∙ Estill-Terpack, S.J. ∙ Plec, A.A. ... Loss of a Negative Regulator of mTORC1 Induces Aerobic Glycolysis and Altered Fiber Composition in Skeletal Muscle Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :1907-1914 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Opposite FNIP1 deletion, which increases oxidative muscle fibers, muscle-specific loss of GATOR1 causes a switch to glycolytic fibers ( Dutchak et al., 2018 30. Dutchak, P.A. ∙ Estill-Terpack, S.J. ∙ Plec, A.A. ... Loss of a Negative Regulator of mTORC1 Induces Aerobic Glycolysis and Altered Fiber Composition in Skeletal Muscle Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :1907-1914 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculate that GATOR1 regulates FEM1B to prevent untimely FNIP1 degradation or coordinate reductive stress and mTORC1 signaling. Our discovery of the reductive stress response thus provides a starting point to dissect, and modulate for therapeutic benefit, the complex architecture of metazoan redox stress signaling, an important step toward elucidating how tissue homeostasis is accomplished in the natural environments of metazoan organisms.

C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC, CRL-1772, female) and HEK293Ts (ATCC, CRL-3216, female) were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . For C2C12 differentiation, cells were grown to 70%–90% confluence and had their media changed 2-3x in differentiation medium, DMEM with 2% donor equine serum. For amino acid starvation, cells were washed 1x in PBS and put in amino acid free RPMI (US biologicals, R9010-01) and 10% dialyzed FBS. 1x Amino acids were added to the cultures at indicated time points. For glucose and glutamine starvations, cells were rinsed in phosphate buffered saline and incubated with DMEM -Glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11966025) or DMEM -Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11960044) with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. SF9 (ATCC, CRL-1711, female) insect cell cultures were grown in in ESF921 (Expression Systems) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15240062) at 28°C with shaking at 125rpm. All cell stocks and SF9 cultures were obtained from the UCB Cell Culture Facility which is supported by The University of California Berkeley.
For the CUL2 and CUL3 adaptor screen, early passage C2C12 mouse myoblasts were seeded into 96 well plates at 400 to 500 cells/well using a Thermo Scientific Mulitdrop Combi system. The next day, cells were transfected with ∼20nM final concentration of siRNAs using an Agilent Velocity 11 Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform. The next day, cells were differentiated by changing the media 3x with differentiation media using the Bravo. Media was changed every day and on the fourth day, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20min. Fixed cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% triton, and stained for immunofluorescence with antibodies in phosphate buffered saline with 10% fetal bovine serum. All incubations for immunofluorescence were done with very slow mixing in a circular motion on a plate shaker for 3 hours for primary antibody and 1 hour for secondary antibody and Hoechst (AnaSpec, 83218). Plates were imaged on a Molecular Devices ImageXpress Micro Widefield High-Content Analysis System with a 10x objective capturing 25 images per well. Images were analyzed by a MetaXpress custom module from Molecular Devices to quantify the myotube area and nuclei count.
Individual siRNA myotube analysis was performed as described above, but with 12 well plates seeded with early passage C2C12 cells at 40,000-50,000 cells per well. The day after seeding, cells were transfected with 20-80nM final concentration of siRNAs depending on the number of co-depletions. For S1QEL1.1 and S3QEL 2 myotube analysis, 12-14 hours after siRNA transfection, the media was replaced with growth media containing DMSO or 1.75 μM S1QEL1.1 and 42.5 μM S3QEL 2 (Sigma-Aldrich, SML1948 and SML1554). These drug concentrations were maintained for all subsequent media changes throughout differentiation. Cells were fixed at day 3 or 4 of differentiation and prepared for immunofluorescence as above. 49 or 100 images per condition were acquired on Perkin Elmer Opera Phenix automated microscope using a 20x objective.

Fem1b, Nprl2, Fnip1, Fnip2, Flcn, Rbx1, Elongin B, Elongin C, Cul2, constructs were cloned from cDNA prepared from C2C12s. DEPDC5, NPRL3, and TRX were generated from 293T cDNA. We cloned FNIP1 as two isoforms, full length and a truncation missing 208-235. Both isoforms interact with and are degraded by Fem1b, but the short form of FNIP1 expresses considerably better and retains binding to currently known FNIP1 interactors. All FNIP1 experiments presented in this study use the short isoform and the residue positions indicated are reference to this isoform. All FEM1B and FNIP1 mutants were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, or site directed mutagenesis using quick change method. The pCS2+-GFP-degron-IRES-mCherry reporter was generated using Gibson assembly of all of the individual components (GFP, IRES, mCherry, and pCS2) ( Gibson et al., 2009 33. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (3714) PubMed Google Scholar ). A 4xGly-Ser linker was added between GFP and two Esp3I sites (NEB, R0734S) which allow for the easy insertion of DNA fragments. The FNIP1 degron was inserted into the reporter construct by annealing and phosphorylating two oligos corresponding to degron sequences with the forward oligo containing an extra CAGC at the 5′ end and the reverse oligo with 5′- ATCA, each complementary to overhangs generated by the Esp3I digest.
All lentiviral constructs were cloned and transformed into Stbl3 E. Coli (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C737303). Lentiviral shFEM1B pLKO.1 constructs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (shFEM1B #1 : TRCN0000303677125, shFEM1B #2 : TRCN0000299671125, shFEM1B #3 : TRCN0000303647125, shFEM1B #4 : TRCN0000303746125, shTXNRD1: TRCN0000046535, shGSR: TRCN0000046425). pLenti-PGK-Hygro-Flag-CUL2 and shRNA containing Lentiviruses were generated in 293T cells by co-transfection with lentiviral constructs with packaging plasmids (pMD2.5G Addgene, 12259; psPAX2 Addgene, 12260) using PEI. Viral supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.45μm filter and concentrated with LentiX concentrator following the manufactures protocol (Takara 631232). Precipitated virus was resuspended in media, aliquoted, and frozen.
Total RNA from C2C12 cells myoblasts grown in 6cm dishes and was purified using nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, 740955). cDNA was generated (Thermo Fisher Scientific, F470) and qRT-PCRs were performed on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using 2X KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (Roche, KK4602). All qPCR primers were ordered from IDT and sequences can be found in Table S3 .
Large scale immunoprecipitations were performed after harvesting cells in cold PBS (20 15cm plates of transfected C2C12 cells or 10 15cm plates of 293T cells) and centrifuging them at 300 g for 10min, and flash freezing them in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5x the volume of pellet weight (ml/g) of lysis buffer (40mM HEPES 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.2% NP40, with Roche cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, the FLAG FNIP1 IP lysis buffer also contained 10mM β-glycerol phosphate, 10mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2.5mM MgCl 2 ). CUL3 and Flag CUL2 IP lysis buffer contained 2mM 1,10-Phenanthroline (Sigma-Aldrich, P1,280-4). Lysates were gently rocked for 1h at 4°C and cleared by centrifugation at 500 g, 5min and 21000 g, 30min. Supernatants were added to 90 μL of ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Agarose Gel slurry (Sigma-Aldrich, A2220) and rotated for 1-2h at 4°C. Beads were washed extensively in lysis buffer and eluted 2x with 250 μL of 3xFlag peptide (F4799, Millipore). Elutions were pooled and precipitated overnight on ice with 20% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated pellets were washed in acetone, dried, and solubilized in 8M urea, 100mM TRIS, pH 8.5. The samples were reduced with TCEP, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested overnight with trypsin (V5111, Promega). Trypsinized samples were analyzed by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) at the Vincent J. Coates Proteomics/Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at UC Berkeley. Specific proteins were identified by comparing each IP to a dataset of 40-150 similar (databases for C2C12 and 293T cells) αFLAG IP/mass spectrometry samples using CompPASS analysis ( Huttlin et al., 2015 43. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Ting, L. ∙ Bruckner, R.J. ... The BioPlex Network: A Systematic Exploration of the Human Interactome Cell. 2015; 162 :425-440 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (602) PubMed Google Scholar ). All total spectral counts were normalized to TSC of bait (4000 for all experiments except for CUL3 and CUL2 C2C12 analysis).
FEM1B knockout HEK293T cell lines were generated using the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) method ( DeWitt et al., 2017 27. DeWitt, M.A. ∙ Corn, J.E. ∙ Carroll, D. Genome editing via delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein Methods. 2017; 121-122 :9-15 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) using guides targeting the 5′ UTR and intronic regions adjacent to exon1 of FEM1B (5′-ATTAACGAGTCCGCGCGCGT-3′, 5′-AAGACGAGCTTTCGCAGACA-3′). Guide RNAs were synthesized with NEB HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (E2040S), DNase treated with turboDNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2238), and purified with a MEGAclear clean-up kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM1908). RNPs were assembled with Cas9 purified by the UC Berkeley QB3 MacroLab in a 10 μL reaction of 100 pmol of Cas9 and 120 pmol sgRNA in Cas9 buffer (20 mM HEPES 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Reactions were gently mixed for 30 s and incubated for 20min at room temperature. RNP complexes and 200k 293T cells resuspended in buffer SF (Lonza) were added to a nucleofection strip and the mixture pulsed with program DS150 Lonza 4D-Nucleofector. Cells were plated into 6 well dishes. Endogenous 3xFLAG FEM1B 293T cell lines were generated using a guide targeting near the start codon of FEM1B (5′-GGCGGCGGCCATGGAGGGCC-3′) that was cloned into pX330 and cotransfectd with a 200bp repair template containing a 3xFLAG tag (5′-TCCGGGGGCGCACGGCAGCTGCAGCGGTGGCGACCAAACGGGTGTTGGAGTTGGCGGCGGCCATGGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGGAGGGCCTGGCTGGCTATGTATACAAGGCGGCCAGCGAGGGCAAGGTGCTGACTCTGGCCGCCTTGCTT-3′) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11668019). After confirmation of bulk editing by PCR for both knockouts and knock-ins, cells were diluted to 5cells/ml and 100 μL of cell suspension was plated per well plated into 96 well plates containing 200 μL total media, 20% FBS DMEM + Pen/Strep. Colonies were expanded and screened for homozygous knockout or 3xFLAG tagging by PCR and western blot and confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Total RNA was extracted from sub-confluent C2C12s treated with siFEM1B, siKEAP1, siFEM1B-siKEAP1, or siCNTRL siRNAs (in triplicate) using a NucleoSpin RNA mini kit (Macherey-Nagel, 740955.250). NGS libraries were made using a TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit (Illumina), with an average size of 250 bp. Libraries were prepared by the UC Berkeley Functional Genomics Laboratory. Paired-end RNA-sequencing was done using a HiSeq400 (Illumina). Sequencing of the libraries was done two times to obtain technical replicates.
We used the Kallisto-Sleuth pipeline to perform differential gene expression analysis between samples ( Pimentel et al., 2017 69. Pimentel, H. ∙ Bray, N.L. ∙ Puente, S. ... Differential analysis of RNA-seq incorporating quantification uncertainty Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :687-690 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, paired-end RNA-seq reads were aligned using Kallisto, using the mm10 Mus musculus reference transcriptome and 200 bootstrap steps. For differential expression analysis, the R Sleuth package was used. To obtain log2 fold changes, we had to implement the following transformation function during the initial sleuth object (so) preparation step: 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 < − 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ _ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑝 ( 𝑠 ⁢ 2 ⁢ 𝑐 , ∼ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 / 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 _ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑝 , 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 _ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 _ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑦 = 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑈 ⁢ 𝐸 , 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑡 _ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑔 = 𝑡 ⁢ 2 ⁢ 𝑔 , 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 _ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 = 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 2 ⁢ ( 𝑥 + 0 . 5 ) ) To identify significant differentially expressed genes, the following conditions were compared: siCNTRL v siFem1b; siCNTRL v siKeap1; siFem1b v siKeap1. From each comparison, significant differentially expressed genes with a qval ≤ 0.075 were kept. This generated four different gene lists, which were then merged together. This gene list was used to generate heatmaps for data visualization. Heatmaps of significant differentially expressed genes were generated using the R “heatmap.2” package, normalized by row, and using unsupervised clustering applying the “ward.D2” option. Transcription factor enrichment for significant differentially expressed genes was done using the ChEA3 and oPOSSUM algorithms ( Keenan et al., 2019 50. Keenan, A.B. ∙ Torre, D. ∙ Lachmann, A. ...

siCNTRL, siFEM1B, siFNIP1, and siFNIP1-siFEM1B treated C2C12 cells were grown to 50% confluence and fixed in 2% guleteraldehyde: 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2) for 20 min, followed by 3 washes with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Cells were then gently harvested and collected in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, followed by imbedding in agarose plugs. After solidifying, agar plugs containing the specimens were carefully cut into ∼2.5 mm 3 slices. Slices were stained in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 1 hr, followed by 1.38% potassium ferricyanide for 1 hr. Stained samples were step-dehydrated in acetone (35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 95%, 100%, 100%) for 10 min at each step. Dehydrated samples were then step-infiltrated with acetone:Epon resin (2:1, 1:1, 1:2 for 1 hr each). After final acetone:resin infiltration, samples were embedded in pure Epon resin at room temperature, overnight, followed by curing at 65°C for two days. Cured samples were then sliced using a Leica UC 6 microtome, taking 70 nm sections. Sliced sections were picked up on 100 mesh formvar-coated copper grids, then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 5 min, followed by 2% lead citrate for 2 min. Grids were examined under a Tecnai 12 TEM at 120 kV.
All quantifications are presented as the means ± standard deviation. Significance was determined by 2 tailed t test, ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001. All quantitative myotube analysis figures represent at least 3 independent biological replicates ( Figure 1 A is 2 biological replicate screen done in duplicate and Figure S2 J are the quantification of 2 technical replicates). Seahorse and glucose uptake quantification in Figures 7 A, 7B, and 7E is presented as the mean of 4-6 wells per condition. ECAR measurements were calculated from 4 biological replicates consisting of 5-6 well each. All luciferase assays were measured from 5 biological replicates unless otherwise indicated ( Figure 1 E comprises 2 biological replicates Figure S5 D is from 1). All metabolomics experiments are quantified from 5 technical replicates. For the NRF2 nuclear localization ratio a mask was created in Fiji for the nuclei channel (Hoechst) and for the cytoplasm 1 μm around the nuclei mask, the NRF2 signal from these masks was measured (n = 15-20). For the mitochondrial distance measurement, a line was drawn from the edge of nuclei to the farthest point of the mitochondrial staining (n = 10-15, ∗∗ p = 9.05E-11 and ∗∗∗ p = 1.57E-12).
