Title: Glioblastoma hijacks neuronal mechanisms for brain invasion


Abstract: Summary

Glioblastomas are incurable tumors infiltrating the brain. A subpopulation of glioblastoma cells forms a functional and therapy-resistant tumor cell network interconnected by tumor microtubes (TMs). Other subpopulations appear unconnected, and their biological role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that whole-brain colonization is fueled by glioblastoma cells that lack connections with other tumor cells and astrocytes yet receive synaptic input from neurons. This subpopulation corresponds to neuronal and neural-progenitor-like tumor cell states, as defined by single-cell transcriptomics, both in mouse models and in the human disease. Tumor cell invasion resembled neuronal migration mechanisms and adopted a Lévy-like movement pattern of probing the environment. Neuronal activity induced complex calcium signals in glioblastoma cells followed by the de novo formation of TMs and increased invasion speed. Collectively, superimposing molecular and functional single-cell data revealed that neuronal mechanisms govern glioblastoma cell invasion on multiple levels. This explains how glioblastoma’s dissemination and cellular heterogeneity are closely interlinked.

Section: Introduction

Glioblastomas (GBs) are incurable brain tumors characterized by their cellular heterogeneity ( Garofano et al., 2021 24. Garofano, L. ∙ Migliozzi, S. ∙ Oh, Y.T. ...

Addressing diffuse glioma as a systemic brain disease with single-cell analysis Arch. Neurol. 2012; 69 :523-526 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ), rendering these tumors incurable. GBs also show considerable resistance against standard-of-care treatment with radio- and chemotherapy as well as surgical resection ( Wick et al., 2018 102. Wick, W. ∙ Osswald, M. ∙ Wick, A. ... Treatment of glioblastoma in adults Ther. Adv. Neurol. Diso. 2018; 11 1756286418790452 PubMed Google Scholar ). A large subpopulation of GB cells (GBCs) can organize in networks where they are connected with each other via ultralong and thin membrane protrusions, tumor microtubes (TMs), that are the anatomical basis of a highly functional tumor cell network coupled via gap junctions. This network is a key mediator of therapeutic resistance ( Osswald et al., 2015 57. Osswald, M. ∙ Jung, E. ∙ Sahm, F. ... Brain tumour cells interconnect to a functional and resistant network Nature. 2015; 528 :93-98 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weil et al., 2017 101.

Oncol. 2017; 19 :1316-1326 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, neuronal activity—via paracrine signaling and glutamatergic synapses that are formed onto GBC networks—can activate these networks and are associated with increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91.

This could imply that mutually connected GBCs also drive invasion ( Gritsenko et al., 2020 32. Gritsenko, P.G. ∙ Atlasy, N. ∙ Dieteren, C.E.J. ... p120-catenin-dependent collective brain infiltration by glioma cell networks Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :97-107 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), similar to collective migration in other cancer entities ( Friedl et al., 2012 23. Friedl, P. ∙ Locker, J. ∙ Sahai, E. ... Classifying collective cancer cell invasion Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14 :777-783 Crossref Scopus (635) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternative current models describe GBC invasion along blood vessels, nerve and astrocytic tracts, and diffusely through the extracellular matrix ( Cuddapah et al., 2014 13. Cuddapah, V.A. ∙ Robel, S. ∙ Watkins, S. ... A neurocentric perspective on glioma invasion Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15 :455-465 Crossref Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ). In light of these data, two important questions remain: what are the mechanisms of GB brain invasion? And what is the role of GBCs not connected to other tumor cells? How the latter contribute to tumor progression and interact with other cells of the tumor microenvironment, such as astrocytes and neurons, remains unclear.
The heterogeneous molecular composition of GBCs has been recently classified using pathway-based and gene-expression-based cell states ( Garofano et al., 2021 24. Garofano, L. ∙ Migliozzi, S. ∙ Oh, Y.T. ... Pathway-based classification of glioblastoma uncovers a mitochondrial subtype with therapeutic vulnerabilities Nat.

Richards, L.M. ∙ Whitley, O.K.N. ∙ MacLeod, G. ... Gradient of Developmental and Injury Response transcriptional states defines functional vulnerabilities underpinning glioblastoma heterogeneity Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :157-173 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019a 97. Wang, L. ∙ Babikir, H. ∙ Müller, S. ... The phenotypes of proliferating glioblastoma cells reside on a single axis of variation Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1708-1719 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains an open question how these molecular cell states are related to tumor biology, which includes the recently discovered neuronal GBC state ( Garofano et al., 2021 24. Garofano, L. ∙ Migliozzi, S. ∙ Oh, Y.T. ... Pathway-based classification of glioblastoma uncovers a mitochondrial subtype with therapeutic vulnerabilities Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :141-156 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particularly, how those GBC states are functionally related to tumor cell connectivity and ability to invade the normal brain is unclear. In addition, it is still controversial what kind of trajectories brain tumor cell states follow ( Chaligne et al., 2021 11. Chaligne, R. ∙ Gaiti, F. ∙ Silverbush, D. ... Epigenetic encoding, heritability and plasticity of glioma transcriptional cell states Nat. Genet. 2021; 53 :1469-1479 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019a 97.

The phenotypes of proliferating glioblastoma cells reside on a single axis of variation Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1708-1719 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ) and how these cell states might change with disease progression.
Here, we integrate molecular and functional states of GBCs to lay the ground for insights into multidimensional tumor cell heterogeneity and its relation to multicellular connectivity and propensity of brain invasion. Longitudinal time-lapse imaging of migrating GBCs in vivo revealed that single GBCs lacking connections to other GBCs and astrocytes are main drivers of diffuse brain tumor invasion. These GBCs were enriched for neuronal, neural-progenitor-like, and non-mesenchymal-like (MES-like) cell states. Infiltrative regions enriched with such tumor cell and astrocyte-unconnected, invasive GBCs transition over time into regions with predominantly tumor cell and astrocyte-connected, stable GBC networks. GBC invasion resembled mechanisms of neuronal migration during development. Lastly, activation of glutamatergic neurogliomal synapses increased GBC invasiveness by stimulating the formation and dynamics of TMs. In summary, three layers of neuronal features governing GBC invasion illustrate parallels between brain development and incurable GB.

Section: Results

To comprehensively characterize intratumoral heterogeneity, we established a workflow integrating longitudinal 3D in vivo imaging of patient-derived human GBCs in the living mouse with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data ( Figure 1 A, patient-derived gliobastoma xenograft [PDX] models and human GB from resected tissue; Figure S1 A; Table S1 ). GBCs were separated into two groups based on their in vivo uptake of the gap junction-permeable dye SR101 ( Nimmerjahn et al., 2004 55. Nimmerjahn, A. ∙ Kirchhoff, F. ∙ Kerr, J.N.D. ... Sulforhodamine 101 as a specific marker of astroglia in the neocortex in vivo Nat. Methods. 2004; 1 :31-37 Crossref Scopus (636) PubMed Google Scholar ): GBCs that were anatomically connected with each other via TMs and gap junctions ( Osswald et al., 2015 57. Osswald, M. ∙ Jung, E. ∙ Sahm, F. ... Brain tumour cells interconnect to a functional and resistant network Nature. 2015; 528 :93-98 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ) took up SR101 and dynamically spread it across the tumor cell network, while GBCs lacking anatomical connections barely took up SR101 ( Figures 1 B and 1C). These mutually connected GBCs showed multicellular co-active calcium events indicating functional connectivity across this GBC subpopulation, while calcium events remained local in GBCs not exhibiting connecting TMs suggesting that they are disconnected from other GBCs ( Figures S1 B–S1D). SR101 accumulated rapidly in astrocytes after intraperitoneal injection while a subpopulation of neighboring GBCs was stained after a delay ( Figures S1 E–S1H). After injection into tumor microregions, SR101 was taken up both by astrocytes and GBCs, which was inhibited by pharmacological gap junction blockade ( Figures 1 D and 1E). To further confirm gap junctional coupling of GBCs with each other, with astrocytes, or with both (from here on termed “connected TUM/AC ”), single GBCs expressing GFP were filled with Alexa 594 via whole-cell patch-clamp recordings performed in co-cultures. This gap junction-permeable dye was dynamically distributed to GBCs and to morphologically distinct astrocytes not expressing GFP ( Figures 1 F, S1 I, and S1J). Consistent with gap junctional coupling, connected TUM/AC GBCs had a significantly decreased input resistance as compared with unconnected TUM/AC GBCs ( McKhann et al., 1997 48. McKhann, 2nd, G.M. ∙ D'Ambrosio, R. ∙ Janigro, D. Heterogeneity of astrocyte resting membrane potentials and intercellular coupling revealed by whole-cell and gramicidin-perforated patch recordings from cultured neocortical and hippocampal slice astrocytes J. Neurosci. 1997; 17 :6850-6863 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 K). This coupling was reflected in TM-mediated morphological connectivity between GBCs and astrocytes in vitro and in vivo ( Figures 1 G and S1 L). To test whether these two cell populations were also functionally coupled, astrocytes and GBCs were loaded with Rhod-2AM applied at the brain surface. Subsequent intravital calcium imaging revealed co-active events in astrocytes and GBCs ( Figures 1 H and 1I), indicating functional coupling of a GBC subpopulation with astrocytes. In summary, GBCs are not only gap-junction-connected among themselves, but also with astrocytes. The discovery of this GB-astrocyte network extends the tumor network concept: from a purely homotypic to an even larger, heterotypic, connected TUM/AC network.
By functionally separating connected TUM/AC and unconnected TUM/AC GBCs, we first sought to define which of them drive diffuse brain colonization. Time-lapse intravital two-photon microscopy revealed that unconnected TUM/AC GBCs are invasive, whereas connected TUM/AC GBCs remained mostly stationary ( Figures 1 J and 1K). Migration speed significantly differed in connected TUM/AC (as evidenced by SR101 uptake or by morphological connectivity) versus unconnected TUM/AC GBCs ( Figures 1 L and S1 M–S1O), demonstrating that GB invasion is dominated by unconnected TUM/AC GBCs.
To molecularly characterize these functionally distinct tumor cell subpopulations, GFP/SR101-labeled GBCs were isolated using cell sorting and submitted to scRNA-seq ( Hai et al., 2021 33. Hai, L. ∙ Hoffmann, D.C. ∙ Mandelbaum, H. ... A connectivity signature for glioblastoma Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Connected TUM/AC and unconnected TUM/AC GBCs could be distinguished by their gene expression profiles in three PDX models ( Figures 2 A and S2 A–S2D). To quantitatively characterize changes in cellular transcriptional programs in the context of potential temporal trajectories between connected TUM/AC and unconnected TUM/AC GBCs, they were sorted according to pseudotime ( Cao et al., 2019 8. Cao, J. ∙ Spielmann, M. ∙ Qiu, X. ... The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :496-502 Crossref Scopus (1050) PubMed Google Scholar ). In all three PDX models used here, transcriptional changes appear along the axis from unconnected TUM/AC to connected TUM/AC GBCs ( Figures 2 B, 2C, and S2 E–S2H). However, this approach does not allow to infer a directionality of the respective trajectories. Therefore, longitudinal intravital two-photon imaging (IV2PM) was used to follow invasion and network formation in a defined brain area at the rim of the tumor ( Figure 2 D). Quantitative analysis confirmed an increase of connected TUM/AC cells over time and with increasing tumor cell density ( Figures 2 E and S2 I–S2Q; Video S1 ). Taken together, combined scRNA-seq and IV2PM suggest a concept of how brain colonization is achieved by brain tumors: unconnected TUM/AC GBCs are taking the lead, colonize new brain regions, and over time interconnect with other GBCs and astrocytes, transitioning to connected TUM/AC GBCs.

GBCs are shown here in the S24 PDX model. Raw data were trained in ilastik (Berg et al., 2019) and the probability map is shown here with an object segmentation of the SR101 signal.
Next, we superimposed intravital imaging and scRNA-seq results to identify key molecular and functional cellular states driving tumor progression. Unconnected TUM/AC cells were predominately enriched for the neuronal (NEU) ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S2 R; Garofano et al., 2021 24. Garofano, L. ∙ Migliozzi, S. ∙ Oh, Y.T. ... Pathway-based classification of glioblastoma uncovers a mitochondrial subtype with therapeutic vulnerabilities Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :141-156 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the oligodendrocyte precursor-like (OPC-like)/neural precursor-like (NPC-like) cell states ( Figures 2 H–2K and S2 S; Neftel et al., 2019 54. Neftel, C. ∙ Laffy, J. ∙ Filbin, M.G. ... An integrative model of cellular states, plasticity, and genetics for glioblastoma Cell. 2019; 178 :835-849.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (790) PubMed Google Scholar ), and neurodevelopmental transcriptional signatures ( Richards et al., 2021 64. Richards, L.M. ∙ Whitley, O.K.N. ∙ MacLeod, G. ... Gradient of Developmental and Injury Response transcriptional states defines functional vulnerabilities underpinning glioblastoma heterogeneity Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :157-173 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 F, 2L–2N, and S2 T). In contrast, connected TUM/AC GBCs were enriched for the non-neuronal cell states (glycolytic/plurimetabolic [GPM], mitochondrial [MTC], proliferative/progenitor [PPR]) ( Garofano et al., 2021 24. Garofano, L. ∙ Migliozzi, S. ∙ Oh, Y.T. ... Pathway-based classification of glioblastoma uncovers a mitochondrial subtype with therapeutic vulnerabilities Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :141-156 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 F), and astrocyte-like (AC-like)/MES-like cell states ( Neftel et al., 2019 54. Neftel, C. ∙ Laffy, J. ∙ Filbin, M.G. ... An integrative model of cellular states, plasticity, and genetics for glioblastoma Cell. 2019; 178 :835-849.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (790) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 H–2K and S2 S). Furthermore, connected TUM/AC GBCs exhibited an injury response transcriptional signature ( Richards et al., 2021 64. Richards, L.M. ∙ Whitley, O.K.N. ∙ MacLeod, G. ... Gradient of Developmental and Injury Response transcriptional states defines functional vulnerabilities underpinning glioblastoma heterogeneity Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :157-173 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) in three different PDX models, confirmed in human scRNA-seq datasets of GB core and infiltration zones ( Figures 2 L–2N and S2 T). The predominance of the neuronal cell state in unconnected TUM/AC GBCs is consistent with an enriched neuronal cell state in the tumor rim versus the core in human GB ( Garofano et al., 2021 24. Garofano, L. ∙ Migliozzi, S. ∙ Oh, Y.T. ... Pathway-based classification of glioblastoma uncovers a mitochondrial subtype with therapeutic vulnerabilities Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :141-156 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2020 105. Yu, K. ∙ Hu, Y.Q. ∙ Wu, F. ... Surveying brain tumor heterogeneity by single-cell RNA-sequencing of multi-sector biopsies Natl. Sci. Rev. 2020; 7 :1306-1318 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 G). Together, the neuronal cell state coincides with invasion at the infiltration zone.
Accordingly, the mesenchymal marker CD44 ( Hara et al., 2021 34. Hara, T. ∙ Chanoch-Myers, R. ∙ Mathewson, N.D. ... Interactions between cancer cells and immune cells drive transitions to mesenchymal-like states in glioblastoma Cancer Cell. 2021; 39 :779-792.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Neftel et al., 2019 54. Neftel, C. ∙ Laffy, J. ∙ Filbin, M.G. ... An integrative model of cellular states, plasticity, and genetics for glioblastoma Cell. 2019; 178 :835-849.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (790) PubMed Google Scholar ) stained high in densely connected TUM/AC GBC regions, but not unconnected TUM/AC ones ( Figure 2 J), and also in the GB core versus rim ( Figure 2 K), consistent with an enrichment in MES-like and non-neuronal cell states ( Figures 2 I and S3 A–S3D). This contrasts with work suggesting a major role for the mesenchymal cell state in GBC invasion ( Iwadate, 2016 38. Iwadate, Y. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma progression Oncol. Lett. 2016; 11 :1615-1620 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ) but agrees with early observations that mesenchymal development was accompanied by multicellular network formation via long membrane protrusions ( Lewis, 1922 42. Lewis, W.H. Is mesenchyme a syncytium? Anat. Rec. 1922; 23 :177-184 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ). Moreover, the gap junction gene GJA1 was also enriched in non-neuronal cell states ( Figures S3 E–S3H) and in MES/AC-like cell states, consistent with broad gap junctional coupling found in mesenchymal cells and astrocytes ( Bodi et al., 2004 5. Bodi, E. ∙ Hurtado, S.P. ∙ Carvalho, M.A. ... Gap junctions in hematopoietic stroma control proliferation and differentiation of blood cell precursors An. Acad. Bras.

Lond. 2004; 555 :617-626 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
In addition, a transcriptional gradient between neurodevelopmental and injury response was linked to molecular GB heterogeneity ( Richards et al., 2021 64. Richards, L.M. ∙ Whitley, O.K.N. ∙ MacLeod, G. ... Gradient of Developmental and Injury Response transcriptional states defines functional vulnerabilities underpinning glioblastoma heterogeneity Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :157-173 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with findings showing that connected TUM/AC GBCs increased TM formation and self-repair after surgical lesions, photoablation and radio/chemotherapy ( Osswald et al., 2015 57. Osswald, M. ∙ Jung, E. ∙ Sahm, F. ... Brain tumour cells interconnect to a functional and resistant network Nature. 2015; 528 :93-98 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weil et al., 2017 101. Weil, S. ∙ Osswald, M. ∙ Solecki, G. ... Tumor microtubes convey resistance to surgical lesions and chemotherapy in gliomas Neuro. Oncol. 2017; 19 :1316-1326 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), single-cell RNA-seq in PDX models showed a high transcriptional injury signature in connected TUM/AC GBCs, whereas unconnected TUM/AC cells were enriched for a neurodevelopmental transcriptional signature ( Figures 2 L–2N and S2 T).
In conclusion, neuronal, OPC/NPC-like cell states and a neurodevelopmental transcriptional signature were enriched in unconnected TUM/AC GBCs, whereas MES-like, non-neuronal cell states, and a transcriptional injury signature were enriched in connected TUM/AC GBCs.
To define molecular changes occurring during tumor evolution from unconnected TUM/AC to connected TUM/AC cellular states, we derived an invasivity gene expression signature from three PDX models based on genes changing as a function of pseudotime from unconnected TUM/AC to connected TUM/AC cells ( Figure S3 I; Table S2 ). This signature was enriched in the tumor rim versus core of tissue obtained from GB patients ( Figures 2 O, S3 J, and S3K), as well as in the neuronal cell state and OPC/NPC-like cell states ( Figures 2 P and S3 L–S3N). Furthermore, the invasivity score correlated well with the distribution of connected TUM/AC and unconnected TUM/AC GBC states, the distribution of the neuronal cell state, and morphological invasiveness ( Figures S4 A–S4F). Lastly, the gene signatures of the invasivity score were positively correlated with genes and GO terms of neuronal features, migration, and invasion ( Figures S4 G–S4J; Table S2 ; STAR Methods ).
As neuronal and neural progenitor-like cell states were associated with invasivity of GBCs, we next wanted to understand how cellular neuronal features relate to brain tumor invasion. GBCs stably expressing mGFP to reveal finest structural details such as filopodia were intravitally time-lapse-imaged at reduced phototoxicity while maintaining spatial and temporal resolution using deep learning image restoration ( Weigert et al., 2018 100. Weigert, M. ∙ Schmidt, U. ∙ Boothe, T. ... Content-aware image restoration: pushing the limits of fluorescence microscopy Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :1090-1097 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ). We refer to this approach as deep-learning-enabled intravital subcellular time-lapse imaging (DeepISTI, Figures 3 A, 3B, and S5 A; Video S2 ; see STAR Methods ). The signal-to-noise ratio strongly increased with DeepISTI, providing a basis for subsequent automated image analyses ( Figures 3 B, 3C, S5 A, and S5B).

DeepISTI workflow and effects on signal-to-noise ratio for intravital imaging, related to Figures 3 and 4 In the first part, the DeepISTI workflow is illustrated with in vivo two-photon microscopy data and the respective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated. This is displayed together with the respective 3D rendering of multiple GBCs with their TMs in the S24 PDX model. In the second part, the three basic mechanisms of TM dynamics are shown in this time-lapse video of single GBC imaged with in vivo two-photon microscopy. For each mechanism (TM branching, TM protrusion and TM retraction) a time-lapse video is shown from S24 PDX mice. In the third part, examples of the dynamic behavior in three classes of small processes (filopodia, TM-like, lamellipodia) are shown here as 3D renderings of in vivo time-lapse imaging of BG5 and BG7 PDX mice.
Before using DeepISTI, we determined the contribution of cellular compartments to cell volume and surface because these parameters govern the interaction of GBC with the brain parenchyma. A quantitative morphometric analysis showed that in single GBCs, TMs contributed mainly to GBC volume and surface area and served as the predominant site of interaction with neurons in the brain ( Figures 3 D–3L and S5 C).
To assess the dynamics of GBCs and their processes, we used DeepISTI to intravitally follow individual cells over several hours in PDX models. Figure 3 M shows an unconnected TUM/AC GBC that extended two processes and moved the soma in the same direction, while retracting the trailing process. In contrast, the soma remained at the same position in non-somatokinetic cells while the TM extended further only little ( Figure 3 M). Somatokinetic cells exhibited a higher TM turnover ( Figures 3 N–3P). To understand whether all TMs contribute to the invasive process, we subclassified them based on whether they are connected to other TMs or whether they are blind-ending ( Figure 3 Q). We found that blind-ending TMs contribute largely to TM invasion, as they showed a much higher turnover than tumor-connected TMs ( Figure 3 R). As expected, unconnected TUM/AC GBCs showed a higher TM turnover than connected TUM/AC ones ( Figure 3 S). When focusing on invasive, blind-ending TMs we found three main mechanisms of TM movement patterns consisting of protrusion, retraction, and TM generation via TM branching ( Figures 3 T and S5 D–S5K; Video S2 ). Interestingly, these mechanisms were reminiscent of dynamics occurring during migration of immature neurons ( Marín et al., 2010 46. Marín, O. ∙ Valiente, M. ∙ Ge, X. ... Guiding neuronal cell migrations Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2 :a001834 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martini et al., 2009 47. Martini, F.J. ∙ Valiente, M. ∙ López Bendito, G. ... Biased selection of leading process branches mediates chemotaxis during tangential neuronal migration Development. 2009; 136 :41-50 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). On a smaller spatial scale we found filopodial extensions ( Figures 4 A–4C, S5 L, and S5M), with only a few converting into TM-like protrusions ( Figures 4 A, 4D, and S5 N–S5P; Video S2 ). TM-like protrusions were thicker and longer than filopodia, and more stable, yet about 50% of them were eliminated ( Figures 4 B and 4D; Figure S5 L). Finally, lamellipodial protrusions could transform into TM-like protrusions, persist, or get eliminated at equal chance ( Figures 4 C and 4D). We also identified these small processes on the ultrastructural level ( Figures 4 E and 4F). When compared with classical TMs, small protrusions were shorter, more dynamic, and less efficient in their growth ( Figures S5 M and S5P). In summary, we suggest that TMs and associated small membrane protrusions mediate the dynamic scanning of the brain microenvironment.
When TMs were manually tracked over time ( Figure 4 G), the analysis revealed small steps interspersed with bigger steps, characteristic of Lévy-like movement ( Huda et al., 2018 36. Huda, S. ∙ Weigelin, B. ∙ Wolf, K. ... Levy-like movement patterns of metastatic cancer cells revealed in microfabricated systems and implicated in vivo Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4539 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zaburdaev et al., 2015 106. Zaburdaev, V. ∙ Denisov, S. ∙ Klafter, J. Levy walks Rev. Mod. Phys. 2015; 87 :483-530 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Several mathematical approaches confirmed that GB TM growth follows a stochastic process with a heavy-tailed step-length distribution. This can be interpreted as Lévy-like ( Figures 4 H and 4I, STAR Methods ), a pattern that has been described in animal predators looking for scarce sources of food ( Humphries et al., 2012 37. Humphries, N.E. ∙ Weimerskirch, H. ∙ Queiroz, N. ... Foraging success of biological Levy flights recorded in situ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :7169-7174 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sims et al., 2008 76. Sims, D.W. ∙ Southall, E.J. ∙ Humphries, N.E. ...

Raposo, E.P. ∙ Buldyrev, S.V. ∙ da Luz, M.G. ... Dynamical robustness of Levy search strategies Phys. Rev. Lett. 2003; 91 :240601 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ; Viswanathan et al., 1999 95. Viswanathan, G.M. ∙ Buldyrev, S.V. ∙ Havlin, S. ...

Lévy flights and superdiffusion in the context of biological encounters and random searches Phys. Life Rev. 2008; 5 :133-150 Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar ). Hence, TM invasion follows a search-efficient mechanism.
To understand patterns of GBC invasion in more depth, we further examined the dynamics of TMs and somata of invading, unconnected TUM/AC , somatokinetic GBCs using DeepISTI. We found three major invasion mechanisms of GBCs: branching migration, locomotion, and translocation ( Figures 4 J and S5 Q–S5T). Branching migration showed extensive branching, protrusion and retraction of the TMs during the invasion of these cells, whereas locomotion appeared in uni- or bipolar cells where the leading TM was protruding, and the soma was following the leading TM. Lastly, translocation occurred with the TM stably anchored and the soma translocating with the length of the TM shortening during this process ( Figures 4 J and S5 U). These three mechanisms of GBC invasion were comparable to neuronal progenitor ( Nadarajah et al., 2001 53. Nadarajah, B. ∙ Brunstrom, J.E. ∙ Grutzendler, J. ... Two modes of radial migration in early development of the cerebral cortex Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4 :143-150 Crossref Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar , 2003 52. Nadarajah, B. ∙ Alifragis, P. ∙ Wong, R.O. ... Neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex: observations based on real-time imaging Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13 :607-611 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tabata and Nakajima, 2003 81. Tabata, H. ∙ Nakajima, K. Multipolar migration: the third mode of radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :9996-10001 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and other neural progenitor cells ( Tsai et al., 2016 85. Tsai, H.H. ∙ Niu, J. ∙ Munji, R. ... Oligodendrocyte precursors migrate along vasculature in the developing nervous system Science. 2016; 351 :379-384 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ) migrating during brain development. Quantitative analyses of these processes revealed that branching migration was the mechanism with the highest TM turnover, and also the predominant mechanism of GB invasion ( Figures 4 K–4M and S5 V). We hypothesized that TM branching during GBC invasion may induce directionality changes during invasion. Indeed, GBCs followed newly formed leading TM branches during migration ( Figures 4 N–4P and S5 W–S5Y). Furthermore, the directionality change of leading TMs during protrusion and retraction was significantly lower than in branched TMs ( Figures 4 O and S5 W–S5Y). This mechanism differs from axonal growth cone pathfinding but resembles interneuron movement during tangential migration ( Martini et al., 2009 47. Martini, F.J. ∙ Valiente, M. ∙ López Bendito, G. ... Biased selection of leading process branches mediates chemotaxis during tangential neuronal migration Development. 2009; 136 :41-50 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Valiente and Martini, 2009 86. Valiente, M. ∙ Martini, F.J. Migration of cortical interneurons relies on branched leading process dynamics Cell Adh. Migr. 2009; 3 :278-280 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, GBCs adopt migration strategies initially described for neuronal progenitor cells during development, a feature that is likely related to their neuronal- and neural progenitor-like transcriptional states.
Next, we asked how neurogliomal synapses ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ; Venkatesh et al., 2019 93. Venkatesh, H.S. ∙ Morishita, W. ∙ Geraghty, A.C. ... Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits Nature. 2019; 573 :539-545 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ) would impact the formation and growth of TMs and tumor invasion. For this, neuronal activity was modulated either by varying anesthesia depth or by in vivo optogenetic activation of neurons ( Figures S6 A–S6C). We found that neuronal activity increased the number of TM branching events and TM turnover ( Figures 5 A–5F), implying that neuronal input drives TM dynamics in the context of invasion. Neuronal activity also increased the average step length of TM movements per GBC ( Figures 5 G and 5H), and Lévy-like movements were significantly accelerated ( Figures 5 I, 5J, and S6 D–S6K). In effect, these mechanisms lead to a neuronal-activity-related significant increase in invasion speed of GBCs ( Figures 5 K and 5L).
To identify contributing cellular mechanisms, we tested whether TMs of unconnected TUM/AC GBCs receive direct synaptic input. Using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to create 3D reconstructions of GBC processes, we unequivocally identified unconnected TUM/AC GBCs in xenograft models and found neurogliomal synapses on these cells ( Figure 5 M). Functionality of synaptic inputs was established ex vivo and in vitro via whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from unconnected TUM/AC GBCs, identified by dye filling ( Figure 5 N). Spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) demonstrated functional synaptic input to unconnected TUM/AC GBCs ( Figures 5 O and S6 L). Additionally, using the same approach, we could show that also connected TUM/AC GBCs can receive synaptic input ( Figure S6 M–S6V). Lastly, we studied the dynamics of neurogliomal synapses on unconnected TUM/AC GBCs. We found that neurogliomal synaptic boutons are predominately transient on invasive, unconnected TUM/AC GBCs ( Figures S6 W–S6Z). Together, these findings demonstrate that synaptic input stimulates unconnected TUM/AC GBCs to invade the brain.
To understand whether neuronal activity was also functionally relevant for putative downstream mechanisms such as calcium transients, we established 3D in vivo calcium imaging of GBCs, similar to Bindocci et al. (2017) 4. Bindocci, E. ∙ Savtchouk, I. ∙ Liaudet, N. ... Three-dimensional Ca(2+) imaging advances understanding of astrocyte biology Science. 2017; 356 eaai8185 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ( Figure 6 A; Video S3 ). We found complex calcium signals including microdomains in TMs and somata ( Figures S7 A–S7F). Neuronal activity drove these complex calcium dynamics in single GBCs. Optogenetic activation of neurons in vivo and in vitro glutamate puffing in co-cultures increased calcium event area and frequency in GBCs ( Figures 6 B–6E and S7 G–S7J). To identify functional consequences of these single-cell calcium dynamics increased by neuronal activity, calcium events were ablated in GBCs using the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis( o -aminophenoxy)ethane- N , N , N′ , N′ -tetraacetic acid). TM generation as well as GBC invasion were significantly reduced ( Figures 6 F–6I and S7 K–S7O). To identify downstream mechanisms, a transcription factor analysis ( Yu et al., 2020 105. Yu, K. ∙ Hu, Y.Q. ∙ Wu, F. ... Surveying brain tumor heterogeneity by single-cell RNA-sequencing of multi-sector biopsies Natl. Sci. Rev. 2020; 7 :1306-1318 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) as a potential neuronal-activity-dependent and calcium-regulated target ( Figures 6 J, S7 P, and S7Q). CREB was targeted with the inhibitor 666-15 ( Middei et al., 2013 51. Middei, S. ∙ Houeland, G. ∙ Cavallucci, V. ... CREB is necessary for synaptic maintenance and learning-induced changes of the ampa receptor GluA1 subunit Hippocampus. 2013; 23 :488-499 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zirpel et al., 2000 109. Zirpel, L. ∙ Janowiak, M.A. ∙ Veltri, C.A. ... AMPA receptor-mediated, calcium-dependent CREB phosphorylation in a subpopulation of auditory neurons surviving activity deprivation J. Neurosci. 2000; 20 :6267-6275 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), resulting in reduced TM generation and GBC invasion ( Figures 6 K–6M). Thus, these analyses together with the discovery of neurogliomal synapses on unconnected TUM/AC tumor cells provide a crucial link between neuronal activity, calcium signaling, and TM-dependent tumor invasion, connecting three key biological factors of brain tumor biology.

In vivo 3D calcium imaging of GBC reveals complex calcium event classes, related to Figure 6 Five distinct classes of calcium dynamics are revealed with 3D calcium imaging in vivo . These calcium transient classes consist of TM calcium transients, soma calcium transients, calcium transients that involve both parts of TM and GBC soma, whole-cell calcium transients and multicellular calcium events where at least parts of multiple GBCs show co-active calcium transients and are connected with each other via direct contacts.
To understand how neuronal synaptic input to GBCs affects TM dynamics, we investigated the spatial distribution of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ; Venkatesh et al., 2019 93. Venkatesh, H.S. ∙ Morishita, W. ∙ Geraghty, A.C. ... Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits Nature. 2019; 573 :539-545 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ). An AMPAR gene expression score was applied to bulk RNA-seq data ( Puchalski et al., 2018 60. Puchalski, R.B. ∙ Shah, N. ∙ Miller, J. ... An anatomic transcriptional atlas of human glioblastoma Science. 2018; 360 :660-663 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as scRNA-seq data of spatially defined GB regions ( Yu et al., 2020 105. Yu, K. ∙ Hu, Y.Q. ∙ Wu, F. ... Surveying brain tumor heterogeneity by single-cell RNA-sequencing of multi-sector biopsies Natl. Sci. Rev. 2020; 7 :1306-1318 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both analyses showed that AMPAR gene expression is enriched at the tumor rim compared with the core ( Figures 7 A–7C and S8 A), supporting a key role of neurogliomal synapses for tumor invasion. In line, AMPAR gene expression scores are significantly enriched in unconnected TUM/AC GBCs compared with connected TUM/AC GBCs ( Figures 7 D and S8 B; Hai et al., 2021 33. Hai, L. ∙ Hoffmann, D.C. ∙ Mandelbaum, H. ... A connectivity signature for glioblastoma Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Correlating these analyses back to the gene- and pathway-based cell states discussed before unveiled enriched AMPAR gene expression in neuronal-like, non-MES-like, and neurodevelopmental cell states ( Figures 7 E–7I and S8 C–S8G). Lastly, we found two cell clusters in the rim of human GB to be enriched for the AMPAR gene expression score, synaptic and cell projection GO terms and associated with a high invasivity gene expression score ( Figures S8 H–S8J). In summary, AMPAR expression in unconnected TUM/AC GBCs of the neuronal and non-MES-like cell states is associated with activity-dependent TM dynamics and invasion.
To link AMPAR-mediated responses to changes in cell morphology, co-cultures of neurons and GBCs were investigated by electrophysiology and confocal microscopy. GBCs exhibiting spontaneous EPSCs when co-cultured with neurons had longer TMs and more branches/filopodia than GBCs without neuronal input, suggesting that synaptic input drove TM formation and growth ( Figures 7 J–7L and S8 K). The frequency and magnitude of GBC calcium events elicited by glutamate puffing was reversibly decreased by CNQX in a GBC subpopulation ( Figures 7 M, 7N, and S8 L). To further support a contribution of AMPARs to TM formation and growth, we expressed dominant-negative AMPAR in GBCs and evaluated the structural consequences by IV2PM ( Figure 7 O). The total length and number of TMs and number of branching points were significantly reduced ( Figures 7 P, 7Q, S8 M, and S8N), consistently demonstrating that synaptic input via AMPAR is required for TM formation and growth. As a first step toward clinical translation, mice received the FDA-approved AMPAR inhibiting antiepileptic drug perampanel, and comparable tumor regions of treated and control mice were assessed intravitally ( Figure 7 R). TM length and branching points were significantly reduced by perampanel treatment ( Figures 7 S–7V and S8 O–S8Z).

Section: Discussion

Our work demonstrates that a distinct subpopulation of GBCs, transcriptionally residing in neuronal- and neural-progenitor-like cell states and not connected to other tumor cells or astrocytes, but receiving neuronal synaptic input, is driving brain invasion via adaptation of cellular neuronal mechanisms. This mechanism of tumor cell migration allows effective brain colonization and thus contributes to GB’s incurability.
In this study, we connected recently described gene- and pathway-based classifications ( Garofano et al., 2021 24. Garofano, L. ∙ Migliozzi, S. ∙ Oh, Y.T. ...

Previous work was focused on tumor-connected GBCs and their networks connected via TMs ( Jung et al., 2017 39. Jung, E. ∙ Osswald, M. ∙ Blaes, J. ...

Oncol. 2017; 19 :1316-1326 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we extended this concept of the “GB connectome” to astrocytes in vivo , with direct gap junction-mediated heterotypic contacts between both cell types ( Sin et al., 2016 77. Sin, W.C. ∙ Aftab, Q. ∙ Bechberger, J.F. ... Astrocytes promote glioma invasion via the Gap junction protein connexin43 Oncogene. 2016; 35 :1504-1516 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 1999 108. Zhang, W. ∙ Couldwell, W.T. ∙ Simard, M.F. ... Direct gap junction communication between malignant glioma cells and astrocytes Cancer Res. 1999; 59 :1994-2003 PubMed Google Scholar ).
In contrast to previous work suggesting collective network invasion of GBCs ( Gritsenko et al., 2020 32. Gritsenko, P.G. ∙ Atlasy, N. ∙ Dieteren, C.E.J. ... p120-catenin-dependent collective brain infiltration by glioma cell networks Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :97-107 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our own hypotheses ( Osswald et al., 2015 57. Osswald, M. ∙ Jung, E. ∙ Sahm, F. ... Brain tumour cells interconnect to a functional and resistant network Nature. 2015; 528 :93-98 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that unconnected TUM/AC GBCs receiving neurogliomal synaptic input drive brain invasion and colonization. This could be explained by in vitro models that were previously used ( Gritsenko et al., 2017 31. Gritsenko, P. ∙ Leenders, W. ∙ Friedl, P. Recapitulating in vivo-like plasticity of glioma cell invasion along blood vessels and in astrocyte-rich stroma Histochem. Cell Biol. 2017; 148 :395-406 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, a sufficient temporal and spatial resolution was obligatory to uncover the role of unconnected TUM/AC GBCs, as these cell states transition into connected TUM/AC GBCs. Thus, unconnected TUM/AC and connected TUM/AC GBCs represent opposite ends of a cell state gradient.
As connected TUM/AC and unconnected TUM/AC GBCs could be functionally separated and subsequently characterized with scRNA-seq, we could overlay their tumor biological differences with the molecular cell states for gene- and pathway-based classification. The neuronal, OPC/NPC and neurodevelopmental-like cell states were enriched in the unconnected TUM/AC GBCs, whereas the connected TUM/AC GBCs were enriched for AC/MES-like and non-NEU cell states as well as those associated with an injury response. In contrast to previous work suggesting a role for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in invasion of GB ( Iwadate, 2016 38. Iwadate, Y. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma progression Oncol. Lett. 2016; 11 :1615-1620 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Siebzehnrubl et al., 2013 73. Siebzehnrubl, F.A. ∙ Silver, D.J. ∙ Tugertimur, B. ... The ZEB1 pathway links glioblastoma initiation, invasion and chemoresistance EMBO Mol. Med. 2013; 5 :1196-1212 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that MES-like cell states were enriched in the core of GB samples where tumor networks prevail.
This is in line with a recent publication demonstrating that upregulation of neuronal signaling programs is associated with brain tumor invasiveness at recurrence in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type gliomas, including GBs ( Varn et al., 2022 90. Varn, F.S. ∙ Johnson, K.C. ∙ Martinek, J. ... Glioma progression is shaped by genetic evolution and microenvironment interactions Cell. 2022; 185 :2184-2199.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We also demonstrate a transition of cell states in GB: with expansion of the tumor mass and as tumor cellularity increases, unconnected TUM/AC GBCs were progressively integrating into a tumor cell/astrocyte-connected network, suggesting an ordered evolution of cell states during the progression of GB. This context-dependent transition of GBC states in the infiltration zone adds another layer of complexity to the recent debate of brain tumor cell state transitions ( Chaligne et al., 2021 11. Chaligne, R. ∙ Gaiti, F. ∙ Silverbush, D. ... Epigenetic encoding, heritability and plasticity of glioma transcriptional cell states Nat. Genet. 2021; 53 :1469-1479 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fine, 2019 21. Fine, H.A. Malignant gliomas: simplifying the complexity Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1650-1652 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019a 97. Wang, L. ∙ Babikir, H. ∙ Müller, S. ... The phenotypes of proliferating glioblastoma cells reside on a single axis of variation Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :1708-1719 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, the framework developed here for GB points toward fruitful opportunities for other tumor entities where molecular intratumoral heterogeneity is increasingly well understood, but without clear links to tumor biology yet.
Analogous mechanisms to neuronal migration during neurodevelopment demonstrate a second layer of neuronal features. The three different mechanisms of GB single-cell invasion in vivo reported here enhance current ideas of GB invasion obtained in vitro ( Bhaduri et al., 2020 3. Bhaduri, A. ∙ Di Lullo, E. ∙ Jung, D.N. ... Outer radial glia-like cancer stem cells contribute to heterogeneity of glioblastoma Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 26 :48-63.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). This extends the concept of how basic neurodevelopmental pathways are hijacked to further brain tumor progression.
The last layer of neuronal features was the observation that neuron-GBC synaptic activity can generate new TMs and also makes their brain scanning behavior more efficient, ultimately driving GB invasion and progression. In addition to previous work suggesting synapses mainly on tumor-connected GBCs ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ; Venkatesh et al., 2019 93. Venkatesh, H.S. ∙ Morishita, W. ∙ Geraghty, A.C. ... Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits Nature. 2019; 573 :539-545 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ), we now found that glutamatergic synaptic contacts are present on unconnected TUM/AC GBCs as well; here, neurogliomal synapses drive efficient migration and brain colonization of GBCs. Together this advances our understanding of how heterotypic multicellular networks in brain tumors are differentially regulating tumor biological functions. Finally, targeting specific subcellular mechanisms of TM dynamics and TM formation decreased overall invasion in GB by mechanisms downstream of AMPAR signaling. Synaptic input stimulating the migration of unconnected TUM/AC GBCs is mirrored by synaptic input driving neuronal progenitor cell migration during brain development ( Ohtaka-Maruyama et al., 2018 56. Ohtaka-Maruyama, C. ∙ Okamoto, M. ∙ Endo, K. ... Synaptic transmission from subplate neurons controls radial migration of neocortical neurons Science. 2018; 360 :313-317 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wefers et al., 2017 99. Wefers, A.K. ∙ Haberlandt, C. ∙ Tekin, N.B. ... Synaptic input as a directional cue for migrating interneuron precursors Development. 2017; 144 :4125-4136 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In conclusion, we present a model of how three layers of neuronal features drive GBC invasion, reaching from molecular cell states over cellular mechanisms that resemble neuronal progenitor-like migration to functional effects of synaptic communication of neurons with migrating tumor cells. This explains how dissemination and cellular heterogeneity of brain tumors, two crucial hallmarks of the disease, are closely interlinked and identifies specific vulnerabilities that can be clinically tested, such as the dependency of migrating tumor cells on AMPAR signaling.
In this study, the nature of tumor progression and evolution of cell states was analyzed using multiple PDX models. However, the effects of therapeutic pressures including radio- and chemotherapy and effects of surgical resection were not analyzed. Thus, to completely characterize tumor heterogeneity, its biological functions, its interrelations with invasion, proliferation, and therapeutic resistance will require further studies. As the IV2PM cell state analysis showed that unconnected TUM/AC GBCs evolve over time into connected TUM/AC GBCs, it will be important to further understand whether and how many intermediary cell states might exist, and how they might interchange during brain tumor progression. Furthermore, it is yet unclear which factors drive this cell state evolution, including the role of neurogliomal synapses. Although neurogliomal synapses exist on both unconnected TUM/AC and connected TUM/AC GBCs, the role for the latter is less well understood; it is reasonable to assume that synaptic input activates intercellular Ca 2+ waves and promotes growth and potentially resistance of the main tumor mass. Interestingly, on a broad gene expression level, unconnected TUM/AC GBCs are enriched for synaptic gene signatures such as the AMPAR gene expression score. However, this is likely due to the large heterogeneity of connected TUM/AC GBCs. Therefore, the characterization of GBCs receiving neurogliomal synapses with respect to their connectivity to other GBCs and astrocytes will be an important line of future investigations. Furthermore, the timescale on which synaptic input effects tumor biology and cell state transitions remains unclear. For this purpose, further technological innovation that can directly link connectivity, molecular, and functional analyses on a single-cell level is needed. It will be interesting to learn whether additional cell types of the brain tumor microenvironment can interconnect with GBCs and heterotypic tumor cell networks. Lastly, the clinical translation of the basic research findings reported here will require further studies in GB patient cohorts and further technological development to monitor the diffuse brain tumor infiltration zone with clinical imaging.

Male NMRI nude mice and NSG (NOD scid gamma) mice (age 8-12 weeks) were used for all animal studies involving human patient-derived primary GBCs. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the European Directive on animal experimentation (2010/63/EU) and institutional laboratory animal research guidelines after approval of the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany and the Animal Welfare Structure of the Luxembourg Institute of Health. Efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used according to the 3R principles. Mice were clinically scored and if they showed marked neurological symptoms or weight loss exceeding 10-20%, experiments were terminated. No maximum tumor size was defined for the invasive brain tumor models. Human tissues were used from patients having given informed consent and after approval of the local regulatory authorities (Ethic Committees at the Mannheim and Heidelberg Medical Faculty of the University Heidelberg, protocols (S-206/2005, S-207/2005, S-306/2019, 2018-614N-MA, 2018-843R-MA), the National Committee for Ethics in Research (CNER) Luxembourg (201201/06) and the regionale komiteer for medisinsk og helsefaglig forskningsetikk at the Helse Bergen (protocol 2013/720/REK vest). Diagnoses were molecularly confirmed with IDH1-R132H and ATRX stainings and the Illumina 850k methylation array (Department of Neuropathology, University of Heidelberg). Human patient samples were pseudonymized manually.
Patient-derived tumor cell lines from resected GB were cultivated as previously described ( Jung et al., 2017 39. Jung, E. ∙ Osswald, M. ∙ Blaes, J. ...

The molecular classification of glioblastoma xenograft models used in this study can be found in Table S1 . The Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC kit was used to obtain the DNA methylation status at >850,000 CpG sites in all GBC lines, according to the manufacturer’s instructions at the Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility of the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany, as described previously ( Capper et al., 2018 9.

Transduced cells were sorted regularly by FACS with either FACSAria Fusion 2 Bernhard Shoor or FACSAria Fusion Richard Sweet. The BL 530/30 filter was used for FACS-sorting GFP and Twitch3A. For tdTomato, the YG 586/15 filter was used.
Surgical procedures were performed as described previously ( Osswald et al., 2015 57. Osswald, M. ∙ Jung, E. ∙ Sahm, F. ...

Cranial window implantation in mice was done in a modification of what we had previously described, including a custom-made titanium ring for painless head fixation during imaging. 500-900 nl of AAV viral particle for either one of the following constructs were injected cortically in 450 μm depth: neuronal channelrhodopsin expression (pAAV-CaMKIIa-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry (AAV2), UNC Vector Core or pAAV-CamKIIa-ChrimsonR-mScarlet-KV2.1 (AAV9), Addgene 124651), a viral construct used as control (pAAV-CaMKIIa-mCherry (AAV2), Addgene 114469) or pAAVCAG-Synaptophysin-mCherry (AAV1/2) (analogous to Wimmer et al., 2004 103. Wimmer, V.C. ∙ Nevian, T. ∙ Kuner, T. Targeted in vivo expression of proteins in the calyx of Held Pflugers Arch. 2004; 449 :319-333 PubMed Google Scholar ) 1 to 3 weeks after cranial window implantation, 50.000-100.000 tumor cells were stereotactically injected into the mouse cortex at an approximate depth of 500 μm. Alternatively, the tumor cell injection was done in one procedure with the cranial window implantation.
For MPLSM imaging, male NMRI nude mice older than 8 weeks (Charles River and Janvier) were operated to implant chronic cranial windows and were injected with tumor cells as described before ( Osswald et al., 2015 57. Osswald, M. ∙ Jung, E. ∙ Sahm, F. ...

Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tumors were intravitally observed from 3 weeks after tumor implantation with a Zeiss 7MP microscope (Zeiss), a Zeiss LSM 980 with Airyscan2 and a TriM Scope II microscope (LaVision BioTec GmbH). All microscopes were equipped with a pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon II ultra; Coherent). SR101, GFP, tdTomato and TRITC dextran were imaged using 850 nm and 960 nm wavelengths respectively. Twitch3A reporter GBCs were imaged at an excitation wavelength of 860 nm. Emitted fluorescence was split with a 560 nm dichroic. The Zeiss 7MP and the Zeiss LSM 980 setup were equipped with bandpass filter sets of 500 - 550 nm and 575 - 610 nm. For the TriM Scope II setup, filter sets with bandpass 500 - 570 nm and longpass 590 nm were used. For FRET imaging, only the TriM Scope II was used. Emitted fluorescence was split with a 495 nm dichroic and filtered with bandpass 460 - 500 nm and bandpass 500 - 570 nm. A 20x, 1.0 NA, apochromatic, 1.7 mm working distance, water immersion objective (Zeiss) was used for imaging at the Zeiss 7MP and the Zeiss LSM 980 setup. The TriM Scope II set up contained a 16x, 0.8 NA, apochromatic, 3 mm working distance, water immersion objective and a 25 x, 1.1 NA, apochromatic 2 mm working distance, water immersion objective (both Nikon). Fluorescence emission was detected with low-noise high-sensitivity photomultiplier tubes.
Isoflurane gas was diluted in 100 % O2 to a concentration between 0.5 - 4.0% depending on the experiment. For the induction of anesthesia, the mouse was exposed to 3-5% isoflurane, which was lowered to 0.5-3% depending on the experiment for anesthesia maintenance and monitored based on the breathing rate of the mice. Eye cream was applied to the mice after anesthesia induction. During imaging, the body temperature of the mice was monitored and kept at 37°C using a temperature sensor and a heating plate. Anesthesia was regularly evaluated during image acquisition by checking postures and breathing rates. TRITC-dextran (fluorescent conjugated tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-dextran, 500.000 g/mol) was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl-solution at 10 mg/ml. Before imaging, 100 μl of TRITC solution was injected into the lateral tail vein for blood vessel visualization. Connected TUM/AC GBCs were classified as such if there was at least one end-to-end connected TM to another GBC manually analyzed in 3D or showed uptake of SR101. Otherwise, GBCs were classified as unconnected TUM/AC GBCs.
An imaging and image processing pipeline was designed to enable high temporal and spatial resolution at low phototoxicity for three-dimensional in vivo two-photon time-lapse imaging. This workflow was developed to visualize and quantify in vivo GBC invasion on a subcellular level. The workflow consists of three layers: deep learning-based restoration microscopy, machine learning-based segmentation and subsequent post-processing analyses for further image enhancement and intensity normalization over time and subsequent quantification of GBC dynamics. For the deep learning-based image restoration we used the Nikon enhance.ai deep learning tool, analogous to the previously published CARE algorithms ( Weigert et al., 2018 100.

Methods. 2018; 15 :1090-1097 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ). To train the enhance.ai model, pairs of 3D image stacks were acquired with low and high signal-to-noise ratios. High signal-to-noise ratio imaging stacks were imaged with a pixel dwell time of 3.14 μs at a pixel size of 0.59 μm whereas low signal-to-noise ratio imaging stacks were imaged with the same resolution, with a pixel dwell time of 0.79 μs. For high signal-to-noise-ratio imaging stacks laser powers between 5-17 mW were measured at the objective. The laser powers used were adapted according to the z-depth. For the low signal-to-noise ratios the laser powers were reduced by 10 %. These data were used in the NIS-Elements AR Analysis software suite to train the enhance.ai model with 1000 iterations. Similar imaging conditions to the low signal-to-noise ratio imaging stacks were then routinely acquired as time-lapse imaging experiments and the enhance.ai inference was applied to restore the low signal-to-noise image stacks. Further improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio and intensity normalization over time was achieved by training the ilastik pixel classification classifier using a combination of raw images and the restored data. Indeed, both pairs of images were used to train the pixel classification workflow and obtained as a prediction the probability map of the foreground pixels ( Berg et al., 2019 2. Berg, S. ∙ Kutra, D. ∙ Kroeger, T. ... ilastik: interactive machine learning for (bio)image analysis Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1226-1232 Crossref Scopus (831) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ilastik probability maps trained on the combination of raw and enhanced images show the highest signal-to-noise ratio and allow analysis of subcellular structures such as TM or even small processes of GBCs in vivo over time. These data can then be further processed and for instance be used for tracking TM dynamics or to perform somatokinetic measurements as described below.
Tail veins were injected with TRITC-dextran under isoflurane anesthesia. Before time-lapse imaging, a stable respiratory rate (RR) was established by manual monitoring of breathing over 15 seconds with an application (Tap BPM https://www.beatsperminuteonline.com/ ). Deep anesthesia corresponded to a mean respiratory rate < 60 bpm, while light anesthesia corresponded to a mean respiratory rate > 100 bpm. Once a stable respiratory rate was established, a field of view with a volume of 607.28μm x 607.28μm x 100μm, was selected and the image stack was repetitively imaged over 4h every 5 min resulting in a total of 48 time points. The laser power was chosen at 90% of the optimal amount according to the built-in range indicator function of Zen to reduce laser power and avoid phototoxicity. Visible drift during time-lapse imaging was corrected manually after image acquisition of each stack in xyz directions. The respiratory rate was monitored after each stack as described above and the isoflurane concentration was adapted if needed to adjust the respective breathing rates as readout for anesthesia depth. After imaging, the mice were observed carefully until they woke up and injected s.c. with 1 ml 0.9% NaCl-Glucose-solution for the prevention of dehydration.
The 48 stacks for each time point were hyperstacked and registered in Fiji via the vessel signal and by using the plugin Correct 3D drift ( Parslow et al., 2014 59. Parslow, A. ∙ Cardona, A. ∙ Bryson-Richardson, R.J. Sample drift correction following 4D confocal time-lapse imaging J. Vis. Exp. 2014; 12 :51086 Google Scholar ).
To analyze the effect of neuronal stimulation on TM dynamics and GBCs, neurons infected with AAV particles expressing CaMKIIahChR2-mCherry (experimental group) or CaMKIIa-mCherry (control group) (see ‘Surgical procedures’) were stimulated with 473 nm laser light (Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co. Ltd, China) via an optical fiber (Laser Components, Item 3016347). Cells were stimulated 15 times at 20 Hz for 30 s using 90 s pause intervals as described previously ( Venkatesh et al., 2015 92. Venkatesh, H.S. ∙ Johung, T.B. ∙ Caretti, V. ... Neuronal activity promotes glioma growth through Neuroligin-3 secretion Cell. 2015; 161 :803-816 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). The PMT shutter of the TriM II MPLSM was closed during stimulation. Stimulation and shutter were controlled using a PulsePal device and a custom written MATLAB script ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). Afterwards, the same tumor microregions were repetitively imaged every five minutes for four hours in analogy to the above-described experimental paradigm using isoflurane anesthesia.
For all SR101 in vivo imaging, SR101 dissolved in 1x phosphate buffered saline (Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally at a dosage of 0.12 mg per g bodyweight as described previously ( Xie et al., 2021 104. Xie, R. ∙ Kessler, T. ∙ Grosch, J. ... Tumor cell network integration in glioma represents a stemness feature Neuro. Oncol. 2021; 23 :757-769 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine SR101 uptake in GBCs, four experimental paradigms were used. In the first experimental paradigm, in vivo 3D time-lapse stacks of GBCs over the course of four hours were acquired (see ‘ In vivo 3D time-lapse experiments with isoflurane anesthesia experimental paradigms using MPLSM’). SR101 was intraperitoneally injected directly after the experiment and a 3D stack of the respective tumor microregion was acquired after six to eight hours. The 3D stack (3.15 μs pixel dwell time, 0.59 μm pixel size) was acquired in the same field of view (FoV) as for the previous time-lapse experiment. These stacks were then concatenated with the time-lapse images from the invasion experiment to clearly identify the same cells for subsequent analysis.
To analyze dynamic SR101 uptake in GBCs and glial cells, SR101 was injected into the mice at the same dosage stated above and after approximately 1.5h, the chosen FoV was imaged once every 5 min for 4 h (volume of FoV = 607.28 um x 607.28 μm x 100 μm, pixel size 0.59 μm, 0.79 μs pixel dwell time). A mean respiratory rate of >100/min was aimed for and the respiratory rate was monitored after each stack. The isoflurane concentration was adapted accordingly. After imaging, mice were injected s.c. with 1 ml 0.9% NaCl-Glucose-Solution and observed until awake. The stacks were hyperstacked and registered as described above.
In the third experimental paradigm, uptake of SR101 in GBCs was weekly determined. SR101 was injected each week as described above six to ten hours prior to two-photon microscopy imaging.
In the fourth experimental paradigm, SR101 uptake in GBCs and its inhibition by the gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone was determined by direct injection of SR101 into tumor regions.
Specifically, 50 nl of 100 μM SR101 and 100 μM carbenoxolone (CBX, Sigma-Aldrich, C4790) were injected under isoflurane anesthesia through a thin glass pipette into the selected tumor regions with similar tumor density > 90 days after tumor injection. For the control experiments, CBX was omitted. The images were acquired 120 minutes after the microinjection.
SR101 signal intensity was measured in 3D image stacks by selecting the cell soma boundary in Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 69. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (31257) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the Polygon selection-tool in a slice with maximum extension in the x/y-axis and measuring the mean grey value in the SR101 channel.
For the SR101 intensity analyses, the results measured over time for GBCs and astrocytes were either normalized by subtracting the mean background intensity per time point, mean SR101 intensity values were normalized per dataset by dividing by the mean background intensity measured in various positions of the 3D image stack or by subtracting a filtered image of the raw data (Gaussian Blur with a sigma (radius)=20) from the raw data.
For the synaptophysin punctae tracking, 500-900 nl of AAV particles expressing the presynaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin (pAAV-CAG-Synaptophysin-mCherry (AAV1/2)) were injected into the mouse cortex at a depth of 400 μm prior to tumor cell injection during the chronic cranial window implantation as described above. Synaptophysin is a synaptic vesicle marker and allows to reliably identify presynaptic boutons that can be distinguished with confocal microscopy as punctae in the range of 0.4-4 μm ( Fantuzzo et al., 2017 20. Fantuzzo, J.A. ∙ Mirabella, V.R. ∙ Hamod, A.H. ... Intellicount : High-Throughput Quantification of Fluorescent Synaptic Protein Puncta by Machine Learning eNeuro. 2017; 4 , ENEURO.0219-17.2017 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three to six weeks after surgery, experiments were performed. Imaging of GBCs and respective synaptophysin punctae was repeated, with a minimal time interval of 1 hour between the first and the last time point (pixel size = 0.21 μm, pixel dwell time = 4.73 μs).
After image acquisition, the images were denoised using Denoise.ai within Nikon NIS- Elements AR Analysis. To determine putative neurogliomal synapses, we first segmented GBC that were fluorescently labeled with mGFP as well synaptic boutons with interactive machine learning ( Berg et al., 2019 2. Berg, S. ∙ Kutra, D. ∙ Kroeger, T. ... ilastik: interactive machine learning for (bio)image analysis Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1226-1232 Crossref Scopus (831) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a subsequent watershed algorithm in Arivis Vision 4D. Next, we used the direct overlap of signal coming from the segmented synaptic boutons and GBCs which allows the identification of putative neurogliomal synapses. Usually, distance thresholds commonly used for determining synaptic connectivity in ex vivo analyses with confocal imaging 0.7-2.5 μm ( Fogarty et al., 2013; Schätzle et al., 2012 22. Fogarty, M.J. ∙ Hammond, L.A. ∙ Kanjhan, R. ... A method for the three-dimensional reconstruction of Neurobiotin™-filled neurons and the location of their synaptic inputs Front. Neural Circuits. 2013; 7 :153 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 68. Schätzle, P. ∙ Wuttke, R. ∙ Ziegler, U. ... Automated quantification of synapses by fluorescence microscopy J. Neurosci. Methods. 2012; 204 :144-149 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the chosen workflow should enable a more reliable identification of putative neurogliomal synapses.
For simultaneous in vivo calcium imaging of GBCs and astrocytes, the following small molecule calcium indicators were applied to the brain surface for 45 minutes as described before ( Osswald et al., 2015 57. Osswald, M. ∙ Jung, E. ∙ Sahm, F. ... Brain tumour cells interconnect to a functional and resistant network Nature. 2015; 528 :93-98 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on previous published protocols ( Kantevari et al., 2011 41. Kantevari, S. ∙ Gordon, G.R.J. ∙ MacVicar, B.A. ... A practical guide to the synthesis and use of membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl esters of caged inositol polyphosphates Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6 :327-337 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Takano et al., 2006 82. Takano, T. ∙ Tian, G.F. ∙ Peng, W.G. ... Astrocyte-mediated control of cerebral blood flow Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9 :260-267 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ): for GFP-transfected tumor cells, 2 mM Rhod-2AM (Life Technologies, R-1244); for RFP-transfected, 2 mM Fluo-4AM (Life Technologies, F-14201). Subsequent in vivo calcium imaging was performed as described previously ( Osswald et al., 2015 57. Osswald, M. ∙ Jung, E. ∙ Sahm, F. ... Brain tumour cells interconnect to a functional and resistant network Nature. 2015; 528 :93-98 Crossref Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In vivo imaging of dominant-negative AMPAR and control GBCs was performed as described previously ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Previously, we validated the dominant-negative AMPAR in HEK cells transfected with GluA2-eGFP and dominant-negative GluA2-tdTomato as compared to cells transfected with GluA2-eGFP alone. As previously described, glutamate-induced peak currents were significantly inhibited when HEK cell were transfected with both GluA2-eGFP and dominant-negative GluA2-tdTomato ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ).
3D in vivo calcium imaging was performed to cover whole GBC calcium dynamics with a sufficient time resolution to capture calcium microdomains, whole cell and multicellular calcium events. Cells were centered in the field of view and their maximum z range was determined. The piezoelectric objective z-actuator was used to repetitively acquire z stacks over a range of 15-25 μm with a z step size between 3-5 μm and a frequency of 0.3-0.5 Hz.
To analyze the effect of neuronal stimulation on GBC calcium dynamics, neurons expressing CaMKIIahChR2-mCherry or CamKIIa-ChrimsonR-mScarlet after AAV infection (see ‘Surgical procedures’) were stimulated with 473 nm laser light (Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co. Ltd, China) via an optical fiber (Laser Components, Item 3016347). For 3D in vivo calcium imaging, regions were stimulated at 40 Hz for 1 s with 1 min intervals between stimulations for five minutes. Baseline activity was recorded for five minutes beforehand. Pulsed illumination at 40 Hz for 1 s was an effective trigger for calcium transients in GBCs as described previously ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The maximum intensity projection (MIP) of the z-stack was used for further analysis. The time-lapse MIP stack was motion corrected using the ImageJ/Fiji plugin moco ( Dubbs et al., 2016 19. Dubbs, A. ∙ Guevara, J. ∙ Yuste, R. moco: fast Motion Correction for Calcium Imaging Front. Neuroinform. 2016; 10 :6 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Calcium events in motion-corrected stacks were analyzed using AquA (Astrocyte Quantification and Analysis) ( Wang et al., 2019b 98. Wang, Y. ∙ DelRosso, N.V. ∙ Vaidyanathan, T.V. ... Accurate quantification of astrocyte and neurotransmitter fluorescence dynamics for single-cell and population-level physiology Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1936-1944 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Image processing was primarily performed in ImageJ/Fiji (e.g. to reduce and remove unspecific background by subtraction of different channels, filtering with a median filter or the ‘Remove Outlier’) ( Schindelin et al., 2012 69. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (31257) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Arivis Vision 4D and ImageJ/Fiji were used for 3D and 4D Image visualization. Image restoration was performed using the enhance.ai tool within the Nikon NIS-Elements AR Analysis software v5.30.01 (Nikon GmbH Germany/Laboratory Imaging) as described above. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) images and in vivo imaging data were denoised using the denoise.ai pretrained model and enhance.ai (see ‘Deep learning-enabled intravital subcellular time-lapse imaging (DeepISTI) workflow’) in the Nikon NIS-Elements AR software v5.30.01 (Nikon GmbH Germany/Laboratory Imaging). Videos were produced in DaVinci Resolve 17.
Tumor microtube dynamics were tracked using MTrackJ ( Meijering et al., 2012 49. Meijering, E. ∙ Dzyubachyk, O. ∙ Smal, I. Methods for cell and particle tracking Methods Enzymol. 2012; 504 :183-200 Crossref Scopus (1017) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each tumor cell process was tracked separately for all time points, and subsequent TM dynamics quantification was performed using custom-written scripts in RStudio (Version 1.2.5033). The directionality change of the leading TM was calculated by comparing the direction of the leading TM at time point 0 and after 4 hours. The directions of the TMs were used as vectors. The angle between the two vectors was determined with ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 69. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (31257) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Measurement of somatokinesis was performed in ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 69. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (31257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were cropped and registered using the 3D Drift Correction plugin in ImageJ/Fiji ( Parslow et al., 2014 59. Parslow, A. ∙ Cardona, A. ∙ Bryson-Richardson, R.J. Sample drift correction following 4D confocal time-lapse imaging J. Vis. Exp. 2014; 12 :51086 Google Scholar ). The cell somata were outlined and the center point of the selection was determined using the centroid function. The distance between the center points of two time points was divided by the experimental observation time to calculate the somatokinetic speed.
The tips of TMs were manually tracked over time with MTrackJ ( Meijering et al., 2012 49. Meijering, E. ∙ Dzyubachyk, O. ∙ Smal, I. Methods for cell and particle tracking Methods Enzymol. 2012; 504 :183-200 Crossref Scopus (1017) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, the steps between each time point of these tracks were extracted. The TM turnover per single TM was determined by adding up the distances between the single steps and dividing this number by the experimental observation time and referred to as TM turnover per TM to sum up the dynamics of single TMs. The TM turnover per GBC was determined by tracking all TMs of a cell, adding single steps up and divide this number by the experimental observation time and the number of TMs. The total TM turnover per GBC was determined by tracking all TMs of a cell, adding single steps up and divide this number by the experimental observation time.
TM turnover per TM was used to investigate the heterogeneity of TM dynamics in blind TMs as compared to 4 connected TMs. To characterise the TM turnover of the three different invasion phenotypes, the total TM turnover per GBC was analyzed. For this purpose, the TM turnover of all TMs per cell was added up. To determine the effects of neuronal stimulation, effects on TM dynamics of whole GBCs were determined. As neuronal stimulation also increased branching TM generation, TM turnover was normalized in addition to the TMs per cell.
The TMs of GBCs were analyzed in three-dimensional imaging stacks to determine whether they were connected or ended blindly: Only end-to-end connections between TMs or TM connected with GBC somata were classified as connected TMs, all other TMs were classified as blindly ending TMs.
Filopodial structures were defined as structures shorter than 10 μm and thinner than 1.25 μm. Structures that were shorter than normal TMs (10 μm), but exhibiting TM diameters from 1.25 μm to 3 μm were classified as TM-like structures. Short structures that were thicker than normal TM (> 3 μm) were classified as lamellipodia like structures.
To distinguish between connected TUM/AC and unconnected TUM/AC GBCs in fluorescent (GFP) PDX models, 0.12 mg/g body weight SR101 injected i.p. into tumor bearing mice prior to perfusion as described previously ( Xie et al., 2021 104. Xie, R. ∙ Kessler, T. ∙ Grosch, J. ... Tumor cell network integration in glioma represents a stemness feature Neuro. Oncol. 2021; 23 :757-769 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). The perfused brain was dissolved into a single cell suspension by using the brain tumor dissociation kit and device by Miltenyi as described before ( Xie et al., 2021 104. Xie, R. ∙ Kessler, T. ∙ Grosch, J. ... Tumor cell network integration in glioma represents a stemness feature Neuro. Oncol. 2021; 23 :757-769 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). The samples were stained with a dead cell marker (TO-PRO3) and a live cell marker (Calcein Violet 450 AM) to identify the vital cell population. The single cell suspension was sorted with a FACSAria Fusion 2 Bernhard Shoor or a FACSAria Fusion Richard Sweet (BD Biosciences). Tumor cells were identified by the GFP signal measured with the filter BL-530/30 and the SR101 signal was determined with the filter YG-586/15. Lasers with wavelengths of 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm were used for this purpose. Tumor cells were gated into connected TUM/AC (SR101 high) and unconnected TUM/AC (SR101 low) groups as described previously ( Xie et al., 2021 104. Xie, R. ∙ Kessler, T. ∙ Grosch, J. ... Tumor cell network integration in glioma represents a stemness feature Neuro. Oncol. 2021; 23 :757-769 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Xenograft single-cell RNA-sequencing data were taken from Hai et al. (2021) 33. Hai, L. ∙ Hoffmann, D.C. ∙ Mandelbaum, H. ... A connectivity signature for glioblastoma Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar . Gene expression count matrices were generated and aligned with Cell Ranger (v.2.1.1, 10X Genomics). Quality controls were performed as described previously ( Hai et al., 2021 33. Hai, L. ∙ Hoffmann, D.C. ∙ Mandelbaum, H. ... A connectivity signature for glioblastoma Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
The Yu dataset ( Yu et al., 2020 105. Yu, K. ∙ Hu, Y.Q. ∙ Wu, F. ... Surveying brain tumor heterogeneity by single-cell RNA-sequencing of multi-sector biopsies Natl. Sci. Rev. 2020; 7 :1306-1318 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) was obtained from the Gene Ontology Omnibus (GSE117891). Cells that were classified as tumor cells as described previously ( Garofano et al., 2021 24. Garofano, L. ∙ Migliozzi, S. ∙ Oh, Y.T. ... Pathway-based classification of glioblastoma uncovers a mitochondrial subtype with therapeutic vulnerabilities Nat. Cancer. 2021; 2 :141-156 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used for the subsequent analysis presented in this manuscript. Data was normalized and scaled in Seurat ( Stuart et al., 2019 79. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4645) PubMed Google Scholar ). Principal components were calculated using RunPCA. The Neftel dataset ( Neftel et al., 2019 54. Neftel, C. ∙ Laffy, J. ∙ Filbin, M.G. ... An integrative model of cellular states, plasticity, and genetics for glioblastoma Cell. 2019; 178 :835-849.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (790) PubMed Google Scholar ) was obtained from the Gene Ontology Omnibus (GSE131928).
Cell cycle scoring was performed on the three PDX models and their scores were regressed out in Seurat. After scaling and centering, principal component analysis was performed. Data was visualized with UMAP using the first ten principal components. Using Monocle3 (1.0.0) ( Cao et al., 2019 8. Cao, J. ∙ Spielmann, M. ∙ Qiu, X. ... The single-cell transcriptional landscape of mammalian organogenesis Nature. 2019; 566 :496-502 Crossref Scopus (1050) PubMed Google Scholar ), cells were clustered and the graph was learned based on the reduced dimensions using the learn graph function. Subsequently, cells were ordered using the order_cells function where root nodes were set to the unconnected TUM/AC cells of each cell line. Pseudotime was inferred for each cell. For all genes, expression was correlated to pseudotime using the stats::cor function. For each cell line, genes whose absolute value of their correlation coefficient was higher than 0.2 were further analyzed. Genes that were correlated or anticorrelated in the same direction in two cell lines were kept. The expression levels for correlated and anticorrelated genes were calculated separately by using the AddModuleScore function for each group of genes. For each cell, the score calculated for the correlated genes was subtracted from the score calculated for the anticorrelated genes to compute the invasivity score. For further validation of the gene sets defining the invasivity score, GeneCards information was downloaded from GeneCards using batch inquiries at GeneALaCart ( Stelzer et al., 2016 78. Stelzer, G. ∙ Rosen, N. ∙ Plaschkes, I. ... The GeneCards Suite: from gene data mining to disease genome sequence analyses Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2016; 54 1 30 31–31 30 33 Crossref Scopus (1361) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the AMPAR gene expression score all four AMPAR genes GRIA1, GRIA2, GRIA3 and GRIA4 were used using the AddModuleScore function in Stuart et al. (2019) 79.

Protocol for derivation of organoids and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts from glioma patient tumors Star Protoc. 2021; 2 :100534 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar . Shortly, primary organoids were derived from mechanically minced IDH-wildtype GB tumor tissue. Organoids were cultured shortly in DMEM medium, 10% FBS, 2mM L-Glutamine, 0.4 mM NEAA, and 100 U/ml Pen–Strep (all from Lonza) for maximum 12 days. Organoids were implanted intracranially to immunodeficient mice and tumor development was monitored by MRI. Tumor development was validated by IHC using an anti-vimentin antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Mab3400), vasculature was monitored with mouse-specific anti-CD31 antibody (Millipore, CBL1337). Tumors were dissociated with the MACS Neural Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Human tumor cells were purified with FACS (as human-specific CD90 + cells) or MACS with Mouse Cell Depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Single cell RNA-seq based on Drop-seq or 10xGenomics technology was performed on purified human tumor cells as described before ( Dirkse et al., 2019 15. Dirkse, A. ∙ Golebiewska, A. ∙ Buder, T. ... Stem cell-associated heterogeneity in Glioblastoma results from intrinsic tumor plasticity shaped by the microenvironment Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1787 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ) and according to the manufacturer’s protocol. scRNA-seq data is available at Omnibus repository ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) under accession number GSE128195.
Gene sets of differentially expressed genes based on anatomic regions were used from previously published work ( Puchalski et al., 2018 60. Puchalski, R.B. ∙ Shah, N. ∙ Miller, J. ... An anatomic transcriptional atlas of human glioblastoma Science. 2018; 360 :660-663 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene sets were analyzed in Cytoscape (Version 3.8.2, Java 11.0.6) ( Shannon et al., 2003 72. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (26124) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool (BiNGO, Version 3.0.4) ( Maere et al., 2005 44.

BiNGO: a cytoscape plugin to assess overrepresentation of gene ontology categories in biological networks Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :3448-3449 Crossref Scopus (3127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overrepresented GO Terms within the Biological Process Ontology were calculated by using a hypergeometric test as statistical test and the Benjamini & Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) Correction to correct for multiple testing. Additional GO term analyses were performed using ShinyGO ( Ge et al., 2020 25. Ge, S.X. ∙ Jung, D. ∙ Yao, R. ShinyGO: a graphical gene-set enrichment tool for animals and plants Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :2628-2629 Crossref Scopus (667) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Transcription factor analysis was performed using the python implementation of SCENIC ( Van de Sande et al., 2020 88. Van de Sande, B. ∙ Flerin, C. ∙ Davie, K. ... A scalable SCENIC workflow for single-cell gene regulatory network analysis Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15 :2247-2276 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene regulatory networks were inferred using the GRNBoost2 algorithm of SCENIC. Enriched motifs were identified and regulon prediction was performed using the CLI ctx function. The enrichment of regulon activity for each cell was calculated using the AUCELL algorithm. Results were integrated into Seurat ( Stuart et al., 2019 79. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4645) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons and astrocytes were prepared as described previously ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the cells were cultivated from E19 embryos and plated at a density of 90,000 cells/cm 2 on 12 mm coverslips in 24-well plates coated with poly-L-lysine and maintained in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 supplement (50x) (2% v/v) and L-glutamine (0.5 mM). After 7 days in vitro (DIV), mechanically dissociated, patient-derived primary GBCs (1000 per well) were added and co-cultured in medium. For electrophysiology and live-cell imaging GBCs (DIV 4-28) were used.
After seeding 1000 GBC onto E19 rat cortex neurons (DIV 7) in 24 well plates and waiting 4-7 days, they were incubated with BAPTA-AM (Sigma-Aldrich; reaching a culture medium concentration of 1,2 μM), 666-15 (Tocris, reaching a culture medium concentration of 1μM) or DMSO as control. After 12-hour incubation, well plates were imaged using a LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 10x (NA 0.3) objective in 37 degrees Celsius and 5% CO 2 every 10 minutes for a period of 9-12 hours.
For live-cell imaging experiments, gabazine (Abcam, reaching a culture medium concentration of 4μM) was added prior to imaging to inhibit GABA A receptor activity, thus disinhibiting neuronal activity and leading to neuronal stimulation and epileptiform neuronal activity ( Margineanu and Wulfert, 1997 45. Margineanu, D.G. ∙ Wülfert, E. Inhibition by levetiracetam of a non-GABA(A) receptor-associated epileptiform effect of bicuculline in rat hippocampus Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122 :1146-1150 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Seeding of S24 GBCs was done as described before, with S24tdTomato and S24GluA2Q dominant negative tdTomato cells ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5-10 days after seeding, cells were imaged in baseline live cell (5% CO 2 , 37 degrees Celsius) conditions using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 10x (NA 0.3) objective. After 4 hours, perampanel (BioCrick, reaching a culture medium concentration of 60μM) was applied and imaged for the same time period.
All images were acquired with a pixel size of 346nm in xy with a fully open pinhole and subsequently analyzed manually with ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 69. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (31257) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For in vitro calcium imaging the genetically encoded calcium indicator jGCaMP7b ( Dana et al., 2019 14. Dana, H. ∙ Sun, Y. ∙ Mohar, B. ... High-performance calcium sensors for imaging activity in neuronal populations and microcompartments Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :649-657 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used. GBCs in our co-cultures were identified by the tdTomato signal.
For live cell imaging, co-culture coverslips (DIV 5-12) were immersed in 2ml neurobasal medium supplemented with L-glutamine (0.5 mM) and B27 supplement (50x). Coverslips were imaged for 100 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius with 5% CO2 using a 20x objective of Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a numerical aperture of 0.75. Images were acquired with a pixel size of 445,63 nm in xy with a fully open pinhole and an image frequency of 1 Hz in a bidirectional acquisition mode.
1000 GBCs were seeded onto rat cortical neurons (DIV 7). After 5-12 days, coverslips were transferred to an upright confocal setup and perfused with carbonated aCSF at 35°C. Simultaneous calcium imaging and puffing was performed. For image acquisition, a TCS SP5 Leica microscope equipped with a 20x water immersion objective (NA 1,0) and a Luigs and Neumann stage was used. Images were acquired with a pixel size of 0,2 μm and 1,3 μm with a frequency of 1,56 Hz in a bidirectional xyt acquisition mode. For simultaneous puffing and calcium imaging, Patchmaster software (HEKA) was used for triggered puff recordings, with a puff applied every 45 s. Puffs were generated at 10-15 PSI using a Picospritzer. Pipettes for puffing were fabricated from borosilicate capillaries (World Precision Instruments) and had resistances of 2-7 MΩ. For all co-culture experiments, aCSF with 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) was used to exclude that action potentials of neurons are evoked by the puffing of glutamate. Puffing was performed as follows: Glutamate puffing, aCSF puffing, drug wash-in for 7 min 30 s, i.e. CNQX (Abcam; reaching an aCSF concentration of 20 μM) /TTX (HelloBio; reaching an aCSF concentration of 1 μM) or BAPTA-AM (Sigma-Aldrich; reaching an aCSF concentration of 1,2 μM) /TTX (HelloBio; reaching an aCSF concentration of 1 μM)) respectively, calcium imaging under pharmacologically altered conditions, CNQX/TTX wash-out (7min 30 s) and in the case of CNQX/TTX calcium imaging after wash out with continuous glutamate puffing after aCSF puffing control. Total recording time per imaging series was 3 min 45 s with 5 puff stimulations. Data were analyzed using ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 69. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (31257) PubMed Google Scholar ) and AQuA ( Wang et al., 2019b 98. Wang, Y. ∙ DelRosso, N.V. ∙ Vaidyanathan, T.V. ... Accurate quantification of astrocyte and neurotransmitter fluorescence dynamics for single-cell and population-level physiology Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22 :1936-1944 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Correlated calcium transients were defined as transients occurring within 20 s or less after glutamate stimulation. GBCs in which ACSF puffing could evoke calcium transients were excluded from the analysis.
For the in vitro synaptophysin punctae tracking, cortical rat neurons (DIV 7) were transduced with 1μl of AAV particles expressing the presynaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin (pAAV-CAG-Synaptophysin-mCherry (AAV1/2)). Three days after neuronal infection, S24GFP GBCs were seeded onto cortical neurons.
Seven days after seeding, these co-cultures were imaged in glass bottom dishes using a TCS SP8, Leica with a 40x objective (NA 1.1) and pixel size of 94,7 nm in xy. They were observed over a period of two hours with a 15-minute interval.
Image processing and analysis were done as described above for the in vivo imaging analysis (see ‘ In vivo imaging of synaptophysin and GBCs’).
For ex vivo analyses of PDX models the mice were anesthetized with either ketamine/xylazine or pentobarbital i.p. First, mice were perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 4-4,5% PFA (w/v) in 1x PBS. After the removal of the brain, it was postfixed in 4% PFA overnight and kept in PBS at 4°C. Serial sections of 70-100 μm were cut with a semiautomatic vibratome (Leica VT1000s). The expression of fluorescence (mGFP or cytosolic GFP) in the GBCs of the PDX models was checked under a wide field fluorescence microscope (Leica DM6000) and slabs of ∼400 μm x 400 μm in size were dissected.
For the nestin antibody staining, the human slices were put into 10% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma) dissolved in PBS for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the concentration was increased and slices were stored in 30% sucrose solution for 12-15h. To prepare the infiltration of the antibody, slices were freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen twice for 5 seconds. As a blocking solution, 5% FBS in PBS was used for 1 hour at RT. The slices were incubated overnight at 4°C with human-specific mouse anti-nestin antibody in blocking solution and washed three times in PBS. The samples were stained in 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) precipitate. For the DAB precipitate labeling, slices were incubated for 12-15h at 4°C with secondary AB, a biotinylated anti-mouse AB (Abcam (ab6788), 1:500, in blocking solution). Slices were washed in PBS three times and then incubated in Vectastain ABC-kit (Linaris) for 1h at RT. Incubation in glucose-DAB-solution (glucose: 2mg/ml, DAB: 1.4mg/ml, dissolved) followed. After another hour of incubation in glucose-DAB oxidase solution (glucose oxidase: 0.1 mg/ml, Serva) the electron dense precipitate could be assessed under a wide field light microscope.
For correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), the sections were stained with DAPI (1:1000) for 1 hour and subsequently imaged under a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a 63X objective (NA 1.4) and a 20X (NA 0.75) a with a pixel size of 200 nm in a z-stack taking an image at every 520 nm with a scanning speed of 400-600Hz. The sections were washed in PBS and in cacodylic buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4, (Serva)) (SERVA#15540.1 Cacodylic acid-Na-salt-3H2O, 100mM, pH 7.4) at 4°C. For post-fixation and contrasting it was incubated in 1.5% potassium ferricyanide (Serva) and 2% osmium tetroxide (Serva) for 1h on ice. Next, the sections were rinsed three times with dH2O and then put on a spinning wheel for 30 minutes. The sections were dehydrated in solutions of increasing ethanol concentrations (70%/95%/100%). The samples were subsequently embedded in resin as described previously ( Horstmann et al., 2012 35. Horstmann, H. ∙ Körber, C. ∙ Sätzler, K. ... Serial section scanning electron microscopy (S3EM) on silicon wafers for ultra-structural volume imaging of cells and tissues PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e35172 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). The self-produced Epon consisted of 455.8 mg/ml Glycidether 100/E812, 308.6 mg/ml DDSA, 235.4 mg/ml MNA hardener and 0,015 ml/ml DMP-30/BDMA. Sections were then infiltrated in a 1:1 mixture of propylenoxide and Epon (Serva) for 12-15h at 4°C, followed by three times rinsing in fresh Epon 100% and embedding in epoxy resin. The sample blocks were polymerized at 60°C for at least 24 hours. Afterwards, the blocks were trimmed with the Leica EM-trim and fine trimming into a trapezoid form was performed with a razor blade. For CLEM, the whole tissue block was cut with a custom-modified ultramicrotome (Ultracut S, Leica) using a diamond knife (DIATOME Ultra 45°) ( Horstmann et al., 2012 35. Horstmann, H. ∙ Körber, C. ∙ Sätzler, K. ... Serial section scanning electron microscopy (S3EM) on silicon wafers for ultra-structural volume imaging of cells and tissues PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e35172 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Serial sectioning of the whole sample (70-100 um) with 40-70 nm slices resulted in up to 30 wafers with up to 100 sections per wafer. While cutting, the bottom side of the trapezoid-shaped sample was coated with a thin layer of Patex glue (Henkel, Düsseldorf, Germany) and Xylene (1:3) to give the long ribbon more stability and connectivity on the water surface in the knife boat.
After drying, the wafers were poststained with uranyl acetate (3%) in a closed dark reaction tube for 16 minutes followed by rinsing shortly in dH2O for three times. A modified Reynolds-procedure was used as previously described ( Horstmann et al., 2012 35. Horstmann, H. ∙ Körber, C. ∙ Sätzler, K. ... Serial section scanning electron microscopy (S3EM) on silicon wafers for ultra-structural volume imaging of cells and tissues PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e35172 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reynolds, 1963 63. Reynolds, E.S. The use of lead citrate at high pH as an electron-opaque stain in electron microscopy J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17 :208-212 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, wafers were incubated with a lead citrate solution for 8 minutes at room temperature in a closed reaction tube to avoid contact with carbon dioxide. Subsequently, the wafers were dried at 60°C for 30 min. The wafers were mounted on SEM pin stubs (0,5”/6mm length #G301F; agar scientific, Essex UK) with Acheson silver (#3692, Plano, Wetzlar, Germany).
For the correlation of GBCs with light microscopy and electron microscopy, overview images of single sections were acquired with scanning electron microscopy to locate the corresponding level in the light microscopy stack. Fluorescent GBCs were identified by the cell/nucleus morphology and the spatial arrangement of the DAPI signal. The exact light microscopic level was unequivocally identified with an overlay of EM and LM with TrakEM2 ( Cardona et al., 2012 10. Cardona, A. ∙ Saalfeld, S. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrakEM2 software for neural circuit reconstruction PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e38011 Crossref Scopus (586) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For image acquisition, a LEO Gemini 1530 scanning electron microscope (Zeiss) and an Auriga (Zeiss) scanning electron microscope were used in combination with an ATLAS scan generator (Zeiss). The working distance was set to 2-3 mm and the aperture to 20 μm. The acceleration voltage was set to 2 kV. For the 3D reconstructions, images were taken at the same spot in consecutive slices. A stack was created with extensions in z with steps of 70-280 nm. Pixel sizes between 2 and 5 nm, a pixel dwell time of 12.8 μs and FoVs ranging from 100 μm 2 to 2400 μm 2 were used as imaging parameters. The acquisition time differed from 3 to 75 minutes. For larger overview images, the FoV size was increased up to 1 mm 2 with a pixel size of 30 nm. Connected TUM/AC and unconnected TUM/AC cells were defined based on morphological connectivity. Direct synaptic contacts formed onto GBCs were counted as such if 2 out of 3 criteria were met: (1) synaptic vesicle cluster present, (2) synaptic cleft visible, (3) postsynaptic density (PSD) apparent. For the analysis of the synapses, EM-sections were reacquired at 2 nm pixel size on each 70nm-section. Manual segmentation of the synaptic bouton was performed in TrakEM2 ( Cardona et al., 2012 10. Cardona, A. ∙ Saalfeld, S. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrakEM2 software for neural circuit reconstruction PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e38011 Crossref Scopus (586) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ultrastructural morphometric synaptic features were analyzed using custom-written scripts in ImageJ/Fiji. The diameter of the synaptic vesicles was measured at the maximum extent in the 2D-section. The boundaries of the cells/synaptic boutons were manually segmented and imported as area lists on consecutive EM-sections in TrakEM2 ( Cardona et al., 2012 10. Cardona, A. ∙ Saalfeld, S. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrakEM2 software for neural circuit reconstruction PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e38011 Crossref Scopus (586) PubMed Google Scholar ). 3D visualization of the structures was performed in Fiji 3D Viewer ( Schmid et al., 2010 70. Schmid, B. ∙ Schindelin, J. ∙ Cardona, A. ... A high-level 3D visualization API for Java and ImageJ BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11 :274 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Meshes were smoothed and the areas were interpolated in z-dimension. The smoothed model was exported to Autodesk 3DS MAX for further visualization.
Following deep anesthesia with isoflurane, xenograft mice were transcardially perfused with 4% (w/v) PFA dissolved in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma or Gibco) after >3 months of tumor growth or showing of symptoms. Brains were collected and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight before transfer to a DAPI (1:10000) solution in PBS. Preparation of serial 80 μm thick tissue sections was performed using a Leica VT000S vibratome.
Permeabilization of sections was performed with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, shaking, for 2 hours at RT. Following, primary antibodies were applied in a 1% FBS and 0,2% Triton X-100 blocking solution and incubation at 4° Celsius overnight, shaking. Before applying appropriate secondary antibodies, 3x washing steps for 15 min with a 2% FBS solution at RT was performed. Secondary antibodies were then coupled to chicken Alexa488 (Invitrogen) and rabbit Alexa647 (Invitrogen) with a dilution of 1:500 (same solution as the primary antibodies) and incubated for 3 hours. Before mounting, the sections were washed first 3x with a 1% FBS solution and then three times with PBS for 10 minutes at RT. Mounting was performed with “SlowFade Gold” solution.
Images were acquired using a 63x immersion oil objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4 at a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS SP8, Leica microsystems and LSM710 ConfoCor3, Zeiss). The pixel size of the acquired images was 141 nm or 220 nm and the z step size was 300 nm.
To validate the phosphorylation of CREB ( Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989 30. Gonzalez, G.A. ∙ Montminy, M.R. Cyclic-AMP stimulates somatostatin gene-transcription by phosphorylation of Creb at Serine-133 Cell. 1989; 59 :675-680 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) in GBCs after neuronal stimulation, DIV5-12 GBC co-cultures were incubated with gabazine (Abcam, reaching a medium concentration of 4μM), CNQX (Abcam, reaching a medium concentration of 20μM) together with TTX (HelloBio, reaching a medium concentration of 1μM) or DMSO for 4 hours. Next, the coverslips were fixated in methanol at -20° Celsius for 5 minutes and subsequently blocked in 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum FBS solution for 10 minutes at RT. Following,the primary antibody (anti-phospho-CREB, Millipore, 1:100 dilution) was applied in a 5% FBS solution and incubated for 1 hour at RT, shaking. Before applying appropriate secondary antibodies, 3x washing steps for 5 min with a 5% FBS solution at RT were performed. 1:500 diluted appropriate secondary antibodies were applied in a 5% FBS solution and incubated for 1 hour at RT, shaking. Before mounting, the coverslips were washed first 3x with a 5% FBS solution and then three times with PBS for 5 minutes at RT, shaking. Mounting was also performed with “SlowFade Gold” and DAPI (1:10000 dilution in PBS). Confocal images were acquired as described for PDX brain sections.
Human biopsy tissue was immersion fixed with 4% PFA overnight as previously described ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). Afterwards, the tissue was washed in PBS and subsequently serially cut to 100 μm thick tissue sections using a Leica VT000S vibratome and stored in PBS. The staining of the sections was done as described above. To visualize tumor cells a mouse anti-nestin antibody (Abcam, ab22035) was used. A secondary antibody coupled with Alexa 488 against mouse was subsequently used. Sections were stained with DAPI to simultaneously visualize nuclei. Images were acquired using a 40x immersion oil objective of a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM710 ConfoCor3, Zeiss) with a numerical aperture of 1.3. Images were acquired with a pixel size of 350 nm and a z step size of 390 nm.
3D rendering and analysis of the in vivo two photon microscopy images of PDX mice and confocal microscopy images of fixed human GB tissue were done using Arivis Vision 4D. Tumor cells were semiautomatically segmented using the ‘Magic Wand’ function. Somata and TMs were manually split and annotated using the ‘Splitting Tool’. Features, such as volume and surface area, were exported for further morphometric comparison.
First, each channel of the confocal images was segmented with a machine-learning based pixel classification using ilastik ( Berg et al., 2019 2. Berg, S. ∙ Kutra, D. ∙ Kroeger, T. ... ilastik: interactive machine learning for (bio)image analysis Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1226-1232 Crossref Scopus (831) PubMed Google Scholar ). 3D Rendering and image analysis were done using Arivis Vision 4D. A custom pipeline was built from existing analysis features to automatically threshold and segment the beta-III-tubulin signal, a pan-neuronal marker ( Sullivan and Cleveland, 1986 80. Sullivan, K.F. ∙ Cleveland, D.W. Identification of conserved isotype-defining variable region sequences for four vertebrate beta tubulin polypeptide classes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1986; 83 :4327-4331 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), from immunohistochemistry. The tumor cells of interest were segmented manually into somata and TMs, and annotated accordingly as described above. Afterwards, the direct overlap of tumor cell signal to neuron signal was automatically determined. Features such as volume and surface area of the detected contacts were exported for further comparisons.
Brain tumor-bearing mice were deeply anesthetized, rapidly decapitated, and the brain was removed in ice-cold slicing solution containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 75 sucrose, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, adjusted to ∼340 mOsm, and aerated with carbogen (5% CO2in O2). 300 μm thick coronal slices were prepared on a vibratome (VT1200S; Leica) and stored in the same solution for 30 min at 37°C. Afterwards, acute slices were transferred into a custom-made incubation system, where slices were slowly cooled down to 16°C and the circulating slicing solution was irradiated with UV light, to extend slice viability as described previously ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). 30 minutes before electrophysiological recordings, slices were warmed up to RT in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM) 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 13 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, aerated with carbogen (5% CO2in O2).
All experiments were performed on a Leica TCS SP5 Confocal Microscope equipped with a Luigs and Neumann stage and a water-immersion objective (20x, NA 1.0) as previously described ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). GBCs were unequivocally identified by their endogenous EGFP or tdTomato-fluorescence, respectively, and subsequently targeted for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Acute brain slices and co-cultured plates were constantly perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 13 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2. The aCSF was permanently aerated with carbogen and heated to 35°C. For the analysis of epileptiform, neuronal activity in co-cultures of neurons, astrocytes and GBCs, gabazine (4 μM) was perfused in aCSF and subsequently neurons were targeted with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. For the analysis of anti-epileptic effects of perampanel ( Chen et al., 2014 12. Chen, C.Y. ∙ Matt, L. ∙ Hell, J.W. ... Perampanel inhibition of AMPA receptor currents in cultured hippocampal neurons PLoS One. 2014; 9 :e108021 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) on neuronal activity in co-culture, epilepsy induced by 4 μM gabazine was compared to neuronal activity under 4 μM gabazine together with 50 μM perampanel.
Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate capillaries (World Precision Instruments) and mounted on Luigs and Neumann-micromanipulators. Pipettes had resistances ranging from 3 to 7 MΩ when put in aCSF and filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 130 K gluconate, 4 KCl, 5 Na-phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP (pH set to 7.2).
An EPC10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) controlled by Patchmaster software (HEKA) was used for acquisition of electrophysiological recordings. Currents were digitized at sampling rates of 25 kHz, filtered at 10 kHz, and Bessel-filtered at 2.9 kHz. The holding potential in the voltage clamp mode was set to -71 mV to correct for the liquid junction potential. Recordings were performed without series resistance compensation.
Electrophysiological data were analyzed using custom written macros in MATLAB and Igor Pro (Wavemetric Inc., Lage Oswego, OR, USA).
To validate the ability of neuronal channelrhodopsin to reliably elicit action potentials, electrophysiological recordings of neurons in co-culture with astrocytes and GBCs were performed. For this purpose, neurons (DIV 7) were infected with 1 μl AAV particles (pAAV-CaMKIIa-mCherry (AAV2)) prior the addition of GBCs to the co-culture model. Infected neurons were subsequently targeted with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Neurons were stimulated with 473 nm laser light (Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co. Ltd, China) via an optical fiber (Laser Components, Item 3016347) with blue light at a frequency of 10 Hz for 1 - 2 s. Currents produced by the opening of voltage-gated channels in the course of an action potential could be reliably elicited.
Perampanel treatment in two xenograft models was performed as described before ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 91. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ten to 100 days prior to imaging, S24 Twitch3A cells or BG5 GFP cells were injected according to the method described above. In vivo MPLSM image z-stacks were acquired at 3 time points (0, 7, 14d). Identical tumor microregions, identified by vascular and other landmarks, were recorded at all 3 time points in every mouse. Imaging parameters for stacks were set to a pixel size of 0.59 μm and to a field of view with a volume of 607.28 μm x 607.28 μm x 240 μm with 81 slices at an interval of 3 μm. On day 0, food pellets of the mice in the treatment group were exchanged by pellets containing 320 mg per kg perampanel (Eisai) and offered ad libitum throughout the time lapse over fourteen days. In a dose escalation study for the GBC line BG5, we applied several amounts of perampanel ranging from 320 mg per kg to 960 mg per kg. Mice in the control group were offered their normal food ad libitum.
For further validation of the invasivity score, we looked at the genes and gene sets that were enriched in the invasivity score. Here, we could clearly see that genes associated with physiological migration of neurons as well as genes associated with tumor cell motility could be found in the 20 genes with the highest invasivity score ( Figure S4 ). Interestingly, the gene for the protein doublecortin (DCX) was among the high invasivity score genes. Doublecortin is a master regulator of physiological neuronal migration ( Gleeson et al., 1999 27. Gleeson, J.G. ∙ Lin, P.T. ∙ Flanagan, L.A. ... Doublecortin is a microtubule-associated protein and is expressed widely by migrating neurons Neuron. 1999; 23 :257-271 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1069) PubMed Google Scholar ) but has also been already described to be involved in GB migration ( Santra et al., 2009 67. Santra, M. ∙ Santra, S. ∙ Roberts, C. ... Doublecortin induces mitotic microtubule catastrophe and inhibits glioma cell invasion J. Neurochem. 2009; 108 :231-245 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another example is the gene MARCKSL1 encoding for the MARCKS-like protein 1. MARCKS-like protein 1 is predominately expressed in the immature brain. Genetic disruption resulted in defects of cranial neural tube closure and neural tube defects where mechanisms such as neuronal migration are critical. Furthermore, MARCKS-like protein 1 has been also reported to play a role for cancer cell migration in breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma ( Liang et al., 2020 43. Liang, W. ∙ Gao, R. ∙ Yang, M. ... MARCKSL1 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells Oncol. Lett. 2020; 19 :2272-2280 PubMed Google Scholar ; Salem et al., 2016 66. Salem, O. ∙ Erdem, N. ∙ Jung, J. ... The highly expressed 5'isomiR of hsa-miR-140-3p contributes to the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-140 by reducing breast cancer proliferation and migration BMC Genomics. 2016; 17 :566 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This further substantiates the concept of parallels between neuronal progenitor migration and tumor cell invasion. In addition, several genes associated with high invasivity have been shown to be involved in either brain tumor cell motility (e.g. BCAN; Zhang et al., 1998 107. Zhang, H. ∙ Kelly, G. ∙ Zerillo, C. ... Expression of a cleaved brain-specific extracellular matrix protein mediates glioma cell invasion in vivo J. Neurosci. 1998; 18 :2370-2376 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) or tumor cell motility across various entities (e.g. MALAT1 [ Tano et al., 2010 83. Tano, K. ∙ Mizuno, R. ∙ Okada, T. ... MALAT-1 enhances cell motility of lung adenocarcinoma cells by influencing the expression of motility-related genes FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 :4575-4580 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ], ETV1 [ Rahim et al., 2011 61. Rahim, S. ∙ Beauchamp, E.M. ∙ Kong, Y. ...

Metastatic properties and genomic amplification of the tyrosine kinase gene ACK1 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15901-15906 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ]).
Further analysis revealed that the gene set for the invasion score is enriched for GO terms involving migration, motility and movement ( Figure S4 ).
In the past decades, Lévy walks have been used to analyze a wide range of mechanisms, e.g., in finance, biology, ecology or physics ( Zaburdaev et al., 2015 106. Zaburdaev, V. ∙ Denisov, S. ∙ Klafter, J. Levy walks Rev. Mod. Phys. 2015; 87 :483-530 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). For example, it has been controversely discussed if Lévy walks can be associated with an efficient search pattern in animal foraging ( Sims et al., 2007 75. Sims, D.W. ∙ Righton, D. ∙ Pitchford, J.W. Minimizing errors in identifying Levy flight behaviour of organisms J. Anim. Ecol. 2007; 76 :222-229 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zaburdaev et al., 2015 106. Zaburdaev, V. ∙ Denisov, S. ∙ Klafter, J. Levy walks Rev. Mod. Phys. 2015; 87 :483-530 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Recently, this movement pattern has been hypothesized to be a characteristic property of metastatic cancer cells ( Huda et al., 2018 36. Huda, S. ∙ Weigelin, B. ∙ Wolf, K. ... Levy-like movement patterns of metastatic cancer cells revealed in microfabricated systems and implicated in vivo Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4539 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the statistical analysis of stochastic processes, the differences between processes in discrete time and in continuous time should be carefully considered. While it can be useful to use a discrete index set to account for the finite number of sampling times and disregard the behavior in between these observations, there is no reason for most biological settings to assume that the actual process does not move continuously in time. This can lead to profound consequences. For example, it is sometimes attempted to determine the distribution of a process 𝑋 by estimating the exponential parameter of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) ⟨ 𝑋 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⟩ ∼ 𝑡 𝛼 for 𝛼 > 0 and 𝑡 → ∞ , which, even within the class of Gaussian processes, does not uniquely determine the process ( Gneiting and Schlather, 2004 28. Gneiting, T. ∙ Schlather, M. Stochastic models that separate fractal dimension and the Hurst effect SIAM Rev. 2004; 46 :269-282 Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar ; Zaburdaev et al., 2015 106. Zaburdaev, V. ∙ Denisov, S. ∙ Klafter, J. Levy walks Rev. Mod. Phys. 2015; 87 :483-530 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We accommodate the two model settings by introducing a time-continuous Lévy walk, which also allows the existence of second moments. In general, it should be noted that the sole analysis of the MSD as a metric to determine the distribution of a stochastic process is insufficient and has significant weaknesses. While it can be used to decide if the process diffuses anomalously (i.e., slower of faster than a Brownian motion) and is a useful tool to analyze the scaling behavior of self-similar processes, the scaling parameter 𝛼 in general does not determine the behavior of 𝑋 on short time scales and for Lévy walks and for stable Lévy processes with stability index smaller than 2 the MSD is not even finite.
Moreover, the MSD relies on a sufficient number of data points at each time step. Specifically, due to the complexity ofdata collection, our dataset comprises a small number of tracks which persist through the whole time horizon. This is a possible explanation for the deteriorating fit of the log-log-linear regression for later stages in the experiment (see Figures S6 D–S6K). Furthermore, it is sometimes criticized that, from a visual point of view, the log-log scale makes relationships seem more linear ( Sims et al., 2007 75. Sims, D.W. ∙ Righton, D. ∙ Pitchford, J.W. Minimizing errors in identifying Levy flight behaviour of organisms J. Anim. Ecol. 2007; 76 :222-229 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
As an alternative, we consider the case of an anomalously diffusive Lévy process ( 𝑋 𝑡 ) 𝑡 ≥ 0 with a stability parameter 𝛼 > 0 which moves through time with an acceleration factor 𝑐 > 0 . Then, 𝔼 ⁡ [ ( 𝑋 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 − 𝑋 0 ) 2 ] = ( 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ) 𝛼 .
For equidistant observation times 𝑡 0 = 0 , 𝑡 1 = 𝛥 , . . . , 𝑡 𝑁 = 𝑁 ⁢ 𝛥 with 𝑁 ∈ ℕ , 𝛥 > 0 , it then holds that 1 𝑛 ⁢ 𝔼 ⁡ [ ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 ( 𝑋 𝑡 𝑖 − 𝑋 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ) 2 ] = 𝛥 𝛼 , for 𝑛 = 1 , . . . , 𝑁 . If the underlying process 𝑋 is indeed a Lévy process, we get for independent trajectories 𝑋 ( 1 ) , . . . , 𝑋 ( 𝑀 ) of 𝑋 through the law of large numbers 1 𝑀 ⁢ ∑ 𝑀 𝑘 = 1 1 𝑁 ⁢ ∑ 𝑁 𝑖 = 1 ( 𝑋 ( 𝑘 ) 𝑡 𝑖 − 𝑋 ( 𝑘 ) 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ) 2 ≈ 𝛥 𝛼 , with a higher number of independent data points involved in the calculation. This quantity can be interpreted as an approximation of the mean-squared variation. By plugging in the MSD estimates for 𝑐 and 𝛼 , we can compare the two approaches. We see in see Figures S6 D–S6K that the estimation is rather rough and the mean-squared variation does not converge, indicating that the assumption of independent, stationary increments might be violated.
Due to a lack of observable drivers of TM growth, we do not specify a stochastic process to model the expansion of TMs. In particular, there is no physiological justification to assume self-similarity. We observe that there is little to no movement in the TMs for a significant fraction of the observed sampling times of the process, interspersed with time frames of large growth. Since the empirical step size distribution is not atomless, a maximum-likelihood approach would yield flawed results. Instead, we rely on nonparametric methods from the field of extreme value theory to capture the behavior of the process and use estimators for the generalized extreme value index to demonstrate that the flight distribution between sampling times is indeed heavy-tailed. We depict the Hill plot generated by the Hill estimator ( Bruce, 1975 6. Bruce, M.H. A simple general approach to inference about the tail of a distribution Ann. Stat. 1975; 3 :1163-1174 Google Scholar ) ̂ 𝛾 ( 𝐻 ) 𝑘 , 𝑛 = 1 𝑘 ⁢ ∑ 𝑘 − 1 𝑖 = 0 ( l o g ⁡ ( 𝑋 ( 𝑛 − 𝑖 ) : 𝑛 ) − l o g ⁡ ( 𝑋 ( 𝑛 − 𝑘 ) : 𝑛 ) ) , 𝑘 = 1 , . . . , 𝑛 , and the Dekkers-Einmal-de Haan plot generated by the corresponding estimator ( Arnold and Laurens De, 1989 1. Arnold, L.M.D. ∙ Laurens De, H. On the estimation of the extreme-value index and large quantile estimation Ann. Stat. 1989; 17 :1795-1832 Google Scholar ) ̂ 𝛾 ( 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐻 𝑘 , 𝑛 = ̂ 𝛾 ( 𝐻 ) 𝑘 , 𝑛 + 1 − 1 2 ⁢ ( 1 − ( ̂ 𝛾 ( 𝐻 ) 𝑘 , 𝑛 ) 2 1 𝑘 ⁢ ∑ 𝑘 − 1 𝑖 = 0 ( l o g ⁡ ( 𝑋 ( 𝑛 − 𝑖 ) : 𝑛 ) − l o g ⁡ ( 𝑋 ( 𝑛 − 𝑘 ) : 𝑛 ) ) 2 ) − 1 , 𝑘 = 1 , . . . , 𝑛 , in see Figures S6 D–S6K, where 𝑋 1 , . . . , 𝑋 𝑛 are the step sizes and 𝑋 𝑘 : 𝑛 denotes the 𝑘 -th order statistic. Though we are not able to determine a high-confidence estimate for the generalized extreme value index of the max-domain of attraction, it becomes clear that the step sizes follow a heavy-tailed distribution. Furthermore, the empirical autocorrelation function for the step sizes in Figure 4 H seems to support the hypothesis of long-range dependence. We show the positive part of the empirical tail function (i.e., the excess tail function in 0) in see Figures S6 D–S6K, which shows a polynomial decay.
As discussed above, we do not assume the structure of a specific stochastic process. Still, it is clear from our analysis that the analyzed TMs exhibit an anomalous diffusion behavior. Since the collection of in vivo data is complex, we rely on a limited number of TM observations, that is, between 50 and 100 tracks per setting. To analyze the effect of small sample sizes on the estimation, we simulate different stochastic processes with a diffusion behavior which is similar to the observed data. We use moment estimators to derive estimates of the stability parameter and the acceleration factor.
In the following, we first analyze several stochastic processes which diffuse anomalously with an (approximately) log-log-linear mean squared displacement. Afterwards, we simulate independent copies of these processes and analyze the behavior of the moment estimates, in particular in the setting of small sample sizes. While for certain processes consistency results for these estimators can be shown, we restrict ourselves to numerical experiments.
Let ( 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑡 ≥ 0 ) be a fractional Poisson process with intensity 𝜆 > 0 and stability parameter 𝜈 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] as defined in Cahoy et al. (2010) 7. Cahoy, D.O. ∙ Uchaikin, V.V. ∙ Woyczynski, W.A. Parameter estimation for fractional Poisson processes J. Stat. Plan. Inference. 2010; 140 :3106-3120 Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar . Furthermore, let ( 𝑋 𝑘 ) 𝑘 ∈ ℕ 0 be a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables with probability distribution 𝑃 𝑋 1 = 1 2 ⁢ 𝛿 − 1 + 1 2 ⁢ 𝛿 1 , independent of 𝑁 . Define the fractional compound Poisson process ( 𝑍 𝑡 ) 𝑡 ≥ 0 with drift 𝜇 > 0 as 𝑍 𝑡 = 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜈 / 2 + ∑ 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) 𝑖 = 0 𝑋 𝑘 . It then holds that 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝑍 2 𝑡 ] = ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 0 𝔼 ⁡ [ ( 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜈 / 2 + ∑ 𝑛 𝑘 = 1 𝑋 𝑘 ) 2 ⁢ 1 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑛 ] ⁢ = 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜈 + ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 0 𝔼 ⁡ [ ( 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜈 / 2 ⁢ ∑ 𝑛 𝑘 = 1 𝑋 𝑘 + ∑ 𝑛 𝑗 , 𝑘 = 1 𝑋 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑋 𝑗 ) ⁢ 1 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑛 ] ⁢ = 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜈 + ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 0 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑛 ) ⋅ 𝑛 ⋅ 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝑋 2 1 ] ⁢ = 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜈 + 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ] ⁢ = ( 𝜆 𝛤 ⁢ ( 𝜈 + 1 ) + 𝜇 ) ⁢ 𝑡 𝜈 .
Therefore, we get that l o g ⁡ ( 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝑍 2 𝑡 ] ) = 𝜈 ⁢ l o g ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) + l o g ⁡ ( 𝜆 𝛤 ⁢ ( 𝜈 + 1 ) + 𝜇 ) .
Fixing either 𝜆 > 0 or 𝜇 > 0 , we obtain a model for which moment estimators are derivable and for a fixed number of observations 𝑡 0 , . . . , 𝑡 𝑛 we set ̂ 𝜈 = 1 𝑛 ⁢ ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 l o g ⁡ ( ̂ 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝑍 2 𝑡 𝑖 ] ) − l o g ⁡ ( ̂ 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝑍 2 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ] ) l o g ⁡ ( 𝑡 𝑖 ) − l o g ⁡ ( 𝑡 𝑖 − 1 ) and estimate the constant 𝑐 = l o g ⁡ ( 𝜆 / 𝛤 ⁢ ( 𝜈 + 1 ) + 𝜇 ) through plug-in estimation. For fixed 𝜆 > 0 , we then use the estimator ̂ 𝜇 = 𝑒 ̂ 𝑐 − 𝜆 / 𝛤 ⁢ ( ̂ 𝜈 + 1 ) .
Following Cahoy et al. (2010) 7. Cahoy, D.O. ∙ Uchaikin, V.V. ∙ Woyczynski, W.A. Parameter estimation for fractional Poisson processes J. Stat. Plan. Inference. 2010; 140 :3106-3120 Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar , we simulate the inter-arrival times of the fractional Poisson process 𝑁 with rate 𝜆 > 0 by 𝑇 𝑑 = | l o g ⁡ ( 𝑈 1 ) | 1 / 𝜈 𝜆 1 / 𝜈 ⁢ s i n ⁡ ( 𝜈 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑈 2 ) ⁢ ( s i n ⁡ ( ( 1 − 𝜈 ) ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑈 2 ) ) 1 / 𝜈 − 1 ( s i n ⁡ ( 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑈 2 ) ) 1 / 𝜈 ⁢ | l o g ⁡ ( 𝑈 3 ) | 1 / 𝜈 − 1 , for independent 𝑈 1 , 𝑈 2 , 𝑈 3 ∼ 𝒰 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] . We use this fact to simulate the paths of a fractional compound Poisson process.
Note that the log-log-linear MSD of a compound Poisson process follows as a special case with 𝜈 = 1 .
Let 𝐵 𝐻 = ( 𝐵 𝐻 𝑡 ) 𝑡 ≥ 0 be a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter 𝐻 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) . Then the MSD of the process 𝑍 𝑡 = 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝐻 + 𝐵 𝑡 for 𝑡 ≥ 0 is given by 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝑍 2 𝑡 ] = 𝜇 2 ⁢ 𝑡 2 ⁢ 𝐻 + 2 ⁢ 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑡 𝐻 ⁢ 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝐵 𝑡 ] + 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝐵 2 𝑡 ] = ( 𝜇 2 + 1 ) ⁢ 𝑡 2 ⁢ 𝐻 .
Therefore, the MSD of the process 𝑍 is again log-log-linear. We simulate trajectories of this process by generating a sample of a multivariate normal distribution with the appropriate covariance structure.
In general, the Karamata Representation Theorem (see, e.g., Theorem 1.5 in Geluk and Haan, 1987 26. Geluk, J.L. ∙ Haan, L.F.M.d. Regular Variation, Extensions and Tauberian Theorems CWI, 1987 Google Scholar ) yields that for any process with deterministic start point 𝑋 0 and second moments of the form 𝔼 ⁡ [ 𝑍 2 𝑡 ] = 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⁢ e x p ⁡ ( 𝑡 ∫ 0 𝑎 ⁡ ( 𝑠 ) 𝑠 d 𝑠 ) , for all 𝑡 ≥ 0 and functions 𝑐 , 𝑎 : ( 0 , ∞ ) → ℝ with existing limits l i m 𝑡 → ∞ ⁢ 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) , l i m 𝑡 → ∞ ⁢ 𝑎 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = : 𝛼 > 0 , the MSD is asymptotically mononomial with exponent 𝛼 , i.e., ⟨ 𝑋 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ⟩ ∼ 𝑡 𝛼 for 𝑡 → ∞ , the characteristic of anomalous diffusion ( Metzler and Klafter, 2000 50. Metzler, R. ∙ Klafter, J. The random walk's guide to anomalous diffusion: a fractional dynamics approach Phys. Rep. 2000; 339 :1-77 Crossref Google Scholar ). Hence, it is straightforward to construct superdiffusive processes for which the MSD on a limited time scale is not log-log-linear. Yet, the empirically observed process has the desired property on the observation interval and, using the models from Gneiting and Schlather (2004) 28. Gneiting, T. ∙ Schlather, M. Stochastic models that separate fractal dimension and the Hurst effect SIAM Rev. 2004; 46 :269-282 Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar , we investigate the estimation stability for the 𝛼 index in small sampling sizes if the long-term scaling limit differs from the short-term behavior.
For the numerical analysis of the moment estimators for the MSD, we simulated 50 trajectories of the different stochastic processes and calculated the estimates for the intercept and slope in the log-log-linear relationship. This was repeated 1000 times and the mean and standard deviation of the respective values were calculated. The number of time steps 40 and the number of trajectories 50 were chosen to reflect the worst-case settings of the real-world experiment. We illustrate the results of the analysis in Figure 4 H. In general, it can be observed that for the processes in consideration the average intercept and slope only mildly deviates from the true values. The empirical standard deviation, however, depends on the respective process, with a larger variance for the estimates for the fractional compound Poisson process.
The results of all quantifications were transferred to GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) or R to test the statistical significance with the appropriate tests (data were tested for normality using the D’Agostino & Pearson normality). Statistical significance was assessed by the two-sided Students’ t-test for normally distributed data. Otherwise, a Mann–Whitney test was used for non-normal distributions. For more than 2 groups a one-way ANOVA test was used for normally distributed data and a Kruskal-Wallis test or the Friedman test (paired data) for non-normal distributed data. Results were considered statistically significant if the P value was below 0.05. Quantifications were done blinded by 2 independent investigators. Animal group sizes were as low as possible and empirically chosen and longitudinal measurements allowed a reduction of animal numbers by maintaining an adequate power. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Quantifications were depicted as dot plots with mean ± standard error of means or as violin plots.
