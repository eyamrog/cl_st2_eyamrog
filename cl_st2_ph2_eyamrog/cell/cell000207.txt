Title: A Phase Ib Trial of Personalized Neoantigen Therapy Plus Anti-PD-1 in Patients with Advanced Melanoma, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, or Bladder Cancer


Abstract: Summary

Neoantigens arise from mutations in cancer cells and are important targets of T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Here, we report the first open-label, phase Ib clinical trial of a personalized neoantigen-based vaccine, NEO-PV-01, in combination with PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or bladder cancer. This analysis of 82 patients demonstrated that the regimen was safe, with no treatment-related serious adverse events observed. De novo neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses were observed post-vaccination in all of the patients. The vaccine-induced T cells had a cytotoxic phenotype and were capable of trafficking to the tumor and mediating cell killing. In addition, epitope spread to neoantigens not included in the vaccine was detected post-vaccination. These data support the safety and immunogenicity of this regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02897765 ).

Section: Introduction

The repertoire of tumor-specific T cells in cancer patients is shaped by interactions between the tumor and the host’s immune response. Neoantigens, encoded by mutations that are unique to a patient’s tumors, are key targets of effective anti-tumor immune responses ( Hu et al., 2018 35. Hu, Z. ∙ Ott, P.A. ∙ Wu, C.J.

Recent first-in-human clinical trials, harnessing the ability to identify neoantigens in real time using next-generation sequencing technology and computational pipelines, have demonstrated that personalized neoantigen vaccines are feasible, safe, and immunogenic in cancer patients ( Carreno et al., 2015 16.

Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has revolutionized the treatment of cancer patients over the past decade. Treatment with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and anti-PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies have demonstrated substantial anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor types ( Havel et al., 2019 29. Havel, J.J. ∙ Chowell, D. ∙ Chan, T.A. The evolving landscape of biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :133-150 Crossref Scopus (1509) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yarchoan et al., 2017 79. Yarchoan, M. ∙ Hopkins, A. ∙ Jaffee, E.M. Tumor Mutational Burden and Response Rate to PD-1 Inhibition N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 377 :2500-2501 Crossref Scopus (2210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the success of anti-PD-1 therapy across a wide range of tumor types, only a subset of patients receives long-term clinical benefit from the treatment ( Sharma and Allison, 2015 65. Sharma, P. ∙ Allison, J.P. The future of immune checkpoint therapy Science. 2015; 348 :56-61 Crossref Scopus (3539) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest in combination therapies to improve the efficacy of ICI and ultimately patient outcomes.
Neoantigens arise from mutations in cancer cells and are important targets of T cell-mediated immunity. A high neoantigen burden in tumors is associated with favorable clinical response and improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with multiple tumor types treated with anti-PD-1 ( Łuksza et al., 2017 48.

Van Allen, E.M. ∙ Miao, D. ∙ Schilling, B. ... Genomic correlates of response to CTLA-4 blockade in metastatic melanoma Science. 2015; 350 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (1998) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the early promise of personalized neoantigen vaccines in the adjuvant setting ( Ott et al., 2017 53. Ott, P.A. ∙ Hu, Z. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ... An immunogenic personal neoantigen vaccine for patients with melanoma Nature. 2017; 547 :217-221 Crossref Scopus (1897) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sahin et al., 2017 60. Sahin, U. ∙ Derhovanessian, E. ∙ Miller, M. ... Personalized RNA mutanome vaccines mobilize poly-specific therapeutic immunity against cancer Nature. 2017; 547 :222-226 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), coupled with the observation that the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 inhibition in melanoma is largely limited to patients with tumors exhibiting a preexisting T cell infiltrate ( Tumeh et al., 2014 73. Tumeh, P.C. ∙ Harview, C.L. ∙ Yearley, J.H. ... PD-1 blockade induces responses by inhibiting adaptive immune resistance Nature. 2014; 515 :568-571 Crossref Scopus (5059) PubMed Google Scholar ), there is a strong rationale for combining these modalities in the metastatic setting. We reasoned that this strategy could augment the response rates and durability of responses over the results of PD-1 inhibition alone by inducing, expanding, and broadening the tumor-directed T cell repertoire.
We report here the first clinical trial combining a personalized neoantigen vaccine (NEO-PV-01) with PD-1 inhibition, in patients with high TMB metastatic tumors including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and urothelial carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder (NCT02897765). In addition to addressing the feasibility and safety of this combination in a large phase Ib study, we performed comprehensive molecular and immune analyses to define the parameters associated with progression-free survival. These analyses revealed that there were few preexisting neoantigen responses. However, following vaccination, there was induction of neoantigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that can traffic to the tumor. In addition, epitope spread to non-vaccinating epitopes and major pathological responses were seen post-vaccination. The approach described here presents a treatment strategy for metastatic tumors based on increasing the frequencies of neoantigen-specific T cells to control tumor growth and spread.

Section: Results

The study was open to patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, smoking-associated NSCLC, and TCC of the bladder, who were enrolled at nine major cancer centers in the United States. The protocol specified at most one prior regimen for metastatic disease and no prior immunotherapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1, although at the start of the study, nivolumab monotherapy was not approved for the first-line treatment of NSCLC or TCC. Enrollment was not restricted based on PD-L1 status. The major study endpoints included evaluations for safety, objective response, progression-free survival, and comprehensive immune analysis in blood and tumor ( Method Details , study protocol).
To produce the personalized neoantigen vaccine NEO-PV-01, tumor mutations were first identified by whole exome and RNA sequencing of each patient’s formalin-fixed tumor and matched normal cells from blood as outlined in the vaccine manufacturing schema ( Figure 1 A). High-quality neoepitopes encoded by somatic mutations were then selected using bioinformatics algorithms, as previously described ( Abelin et al., 2017 1.

NetMHCpan-3.0; improved prediction of binding to MHC class I molecules integrating information from multiple receptor and peptide length datasets Genome Med. 2016; 8 :33 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neoepitopes were prioritized based on the expression of mutated alleles by RNA sequencing, binding to autologous human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A) and HLA-B, and additional variables. Details of the production, including the selection of vaccine peptides, are provided in Method Details . Each neoantigen vaccine consisted of up to 20 unique peptides, 14–35 amino acids in length, and was formulated in up to 4 distinct pools and mixed with the adjuvant poly-ICLC for administration. Patients were treated with nivolumab for 12 weeks while the vaccines were generated ( Figure 1 B, study schema). Starting at week 12, 1.5 mL NEO-PV-01 was administered subcutaneously into each of 4 separate, non-rotating anatomical sites per administration. Five priming and 2 booster vaccinations were administered within a 3-month period, which made up a full NEO-PV-01 course. Nivolumab was continued during both the vaccine and post-vaccine time periods.
Between November 2016 and August 2018, 82 patients were enrolled across 9 clinical sites and received at least 1 dose of nivolumab. This set was defined as the intention-to-treat (ITT) set ( Figure 1 C). Among these patients, 41% of melanoma, 67% of NSCLC, and 71% of bladder cancer patients had prior therapy ( Table 1 ). Thirty-eight percent of melanoma patients had received prior immunotherapy, including ipilimumab (29%) and interferon-α (9%). Nineteen percent of bladder cancer patients had received prior immunotherapy, in all cases Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).
Of the 82 patients in the ITT set, 22 (27%) were not vaccinated for reasons that included radiographic or clinical progression (N = 11), insufficient tumor cellularity or low tumor mutational burden (N = 4), and other reasons (N = 7) ( Figure 1 C). Therefore, the vaccinated set included 60 patients, each of whom received at least 1 dose of vaccine (27 melanoma, 18 NSCLC, 15 bladder cancer). Of the 60 patients, 14 (23%) received the vaccine after radiographic progression on nivolumab by RECIST 1.1 criteria (6 melanoma, 4 NSCLC, and 4 bladder cancer). Although the role of pseudo-progression was considered in progressors, this is a relatively rare phenomenon with anti-PD-1 therapy alone ( Hodi et al., 2018 33. Hodi, F.S. ∙ Ballinger, M. ∙ Lyons, B. ... Immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (imRECIST): Refining Guidelines to Assess the Clinical Benefit of Cancer Immunotherapy J. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 36 :850-858 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ott, 2018 52. Ott, P.A. Immunotherapy: Immune-modified response criteria - an iterative learning process? Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 15 :267-268 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the vaccinated set, 30% of melanoma, 61% of NSCLC, and 73% of bladder cancer patients had prior therapy ( Table 1 ). Eleven of the vaccinated patients had BRAF mutations (2 NSCLC and 9 melanoma) and 3 had KRAS mutations (all codon 12 and all in NSCLC). No other specific mutations (same amino acid change in the same gene) occurred in ≥5 patients in the study.
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NEO-PV-01 in combination with nivolumab ( Tables S1–S3 ). The most common adverse events in vaccinated patients were injection-site reactions and influenza-like illness (52% and 35% of the patients, respectively). Injection site reactions typically manifested as transient, localized warmth and erythema. These events were mild (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 1) in all cases except in 1 patient, who had a grade 2 injection site erythema. Injection site-related adverse events did not lead to NEO-PV-01 dose interruption or discontinuation for any patient ( Table S2 ). Treatment-related events of grade ≥3 severity were noted for only 2 patients in the vaccinated group, with 1 case each of hypokalemia and rash, and 1 patient in the vaccinated group discontinued treatment for grade 2 gastritis ( Table S3 ). No treatment-related serious adverse events were observed.
The objective response rates (ORRs, RECIST version 1.1), PFS and overall survival (OS) were analyzed with a minimum follow-up of 12 months as of the August 2019 data cutoff. Figure 2 summarizes the radiographic response profiles (RECIST 1.1) for each patient by tumor type (change in sum of target lesions) who received anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with NEO-PV-01. The pair of bar plots (top panel) for the vaccinated patients allow for the comparison of the best response before vaccine initiation (dark shade) and the best response overall (light shade). The difference indicates a further reduction in tumor size following the start of the vaccine. The PD-L1 status of the vaccinated patients did not correlate with the ORR in any of the three cohorts ( Figure S1 A). We note that the further tumor regression observed after vaccination could reflect delayed responses following nivolumab monotherapy, although vaccine-induced anti-tumor T cell responses may be a component of these responses. Among the vaccinated patients (N = 60), ORRs (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 59% (39%–78%), 39% (17%–64%), and 27% (8%–55%) for melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer patients, respectively. The median duration of response was not reached for any of the three cohorts. Efficacy data for the ITT and the vaccinated sets are included in Table S4 . Overall, 8 of 60 vaccinated patients met the criteria for tumor response conversions, for a response conversion rate (RCR) of 13%. The RCRs for the melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer patient cohorts were 15%, 17%, and 7%, respectively. Among the 14 patients who had progressive disease before vaccination, 1 patient with NSCLC had a partial response and 1 patient with bladder cancer experienced stable disease after vaccination.
Kaplan-Meier estimates for PFS and OS in both the ITT and vaccinated cohorts for the melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer patients are shown in Figures S1 B and S1C, respectively. The median PFS (95% CI) among vaccinated patients was 23.5 months (6.6, NE), 8.5 months (3.9, NE), and 5.8 months (2.8, 12.7) in the melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer cohorts, respectively. The median OS for vaccinated patients was not reached in the melanoma and NSCLC cohorts, while for the bladder cancer cohort, the median OS was 20.7 months (4.8, NE). The 1-year OS rates were 96% (76%–99%), 83% (57%–94%) and 67% (38%–85%) for melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer patients, respectively ( Table S4 ). These data compare favorably with historical data for anti-PD-1 monotherapy ( Balar et al., 2017 6.

Oncol. 2018; 36 :383-390 Crossref Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ). The clinical data indicate that vaccination with personalized neoantigens is feasible and safe in multiple solid tumor types when co-administered with anti-PD-1 therapy. The single-arm design of the trial does not allow attribution of responses specifically to the vaccine since it was administered in combination with anti-PD-1.
We next investigated the presence of biomarkers that could correlate with PFS across all three tumor cohorts. For this post hoc analysis, we introduced an exploratory endpoint defined by lack of progression at 9 months (PFS-9) post-initiation of nivolumab therapy for the melanoma and the NSCLC cohorts and lack of progression at 6 months (PFS-6) for the bladder cancer cohort. Patients were classified into two groups who either did or did not achieve PFS-9 or PFS-6, respectively. The time point for bladder cancer was set at 6 months to ensure sufficient patient numbers in both groups (PFS-6 or no PFS-6, respectively) due to higher dropout in this cohort. Previous ICI monotherapy studies have investigated clinical outcomes with a variety of different markers, including tumor mutation burden (TMB) ( Cristescu et al., 2018 25.

Mutational profiling of tumor by whole-exome sequencing in all ITT patients revealed a median of 215 non-silent somatic variants ( Table 1 ). Since class I MHC expression on tumors is critical for neoepitope presentation, we also addressed the presence of β2 m mutations in tumor biopsies. There were only two patients from the ITT population who had non-silent somatic mutations in the β2 m gene, with both patients being positive for HLA class I expression on tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (data not shown). Thus, the presence of these types of mutations was rare in the study.
With respect to TMB, we observed a significant positive correlation with PFS-9 in the melanoma cohort and a positive trend in the NSCLC cohort ( Figure S2 A, I). Data for the bladder cancer cohort, which had limited variability in TMB, revealed no such trend ( Figure S2 A, I). The epitope quality score, a unique score assigned to each candidate epitope based on its binding affinity, allele-specific expression, and proteasomal cleavage potential ( Abelin et al., 2017 1. Abelin, J.G. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ∙ Sarkizova, S. ... Mass Spectrometry Profiling of HLA-Associated Peptidomes in Mono-allelic Cells Enables More Accurate Epitope Prediction Immunity. 2017; 46 :315-326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ), falls on a 0–1 scale, with higher scores corresponding to the increased likelihood of presentation. Epitope quality scores of the vaccine peptides (sum of all HLA class I epitopes in the vaccine peptides), which were correlated with overall TMB, likewise showed positive associations with PFS-9 in the melanoma and NSCLC cohorts, but only reached statistical significance for the melanoma cohort ( Figure S2 A, II). No association with PFS-6 was observed for the bladder cancer cohort ( Figure S2 A, II). Evaluation of intra-tumoral gene expression for markers of inflammation ( Ayers et al., 2017 5. Ayers, M. ∙ Lunceford, J. ∙ Nebozhyn, M. ... IFN-γ-related mRNA profile predicts clinical response to PD-1 blockade J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 :2930-2940 Crossref Scopus (2322) PubMed Google Scholar ) at the pre-treatment time point revealed a positive trend for the melanoma and bladder cancer cohorts, but not for the NSCLC cohort ( Figure S2 A, III). Data for the vaccinated set are shown in Figure S2 A, panels IV, V, and VI, and, similar to the ITT set, we observed a significant positive correlation in the melanoma cohort for the epitope quality score and a trend toward positive correlation for TMB. Whole-exome sequencing of additional biopsies taken later in the treatment course showed only minor changes in the mutational landscape and TMB. Overall, these data suggest that both TMB and epitope quality are important determinants of response to the combination of the neoantigen vaccine and anti-PD-1 therapy.
To characterize potential biomarkers outside the tumor microenvironment, we evaluated distinct immune cell phenotypes including T, B, natural killer (NK), and myeloid cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained at week 0 (pre-treatment), week 10 (pre-vaccine), and week 20 (post-vaccine) in patients from all 3 cohorts. Melanoma patients who achieved PFS-9 had a higher percentage of peripheral effector memory CD8 + T cells compared to patients with progression before the 9-month mark, with significant differences observed at both the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine time points ( Figure 3 A). Conversely, the percentage of naive CD8 + T cells was higher in melanoma patients with progression, with significant differences observed at all three time points ( Figure 3 A). Consistent with the observation of increased effector memory CD8 + T cells, melanoma patients with PFS-9 had a more restricted and less diverse circulating T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire than patients who progressed ( Figure 3 B) ( Fairfax et al., 2020 26.

Distinct immune phenotypes in the peripheral blood were also observed in the NSCLC and bladder cancer cohorts correlating with PFS-9 and PFS-6, respectively, although the number of samples available in these cohorts was limited. NSCLC patients who achieved PFS-9 had a lower percentage of plasmacytoid DCs than patients who progressed ( Figure S2 B, I). Significant correlation to plasmacytoid DCs was not seen in the melanoma or bladder cancer cohorts. Bladder cancer patients who achieved PFS-6 had a significantly higher percentage of memory CD8 + T cells that was observed only at the post-vaccine time point when compared to bladder cancer patients who progressed ( Figure S2 B, II).
We further evaluated the presence of stem-like memory T cells in the tumor using a gene signature analysis based on recently defined genes that includes TCF7, a critical transcription factor defining stem-like T cells ( Jansen et al., 2019 37. Jansen, C.S. ∙ Prokhnevska, N. ∙ Master, V.A. ... An intra-tumoral niche maintains and differentiates stem-like CD8 T cells Nature. 2019; 576 :465-470 Crossref Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sade-Feldman et al., 2018 59. Sade-Feldman, M. ∙ Yizhak, K. ∙ Bjorgaard, S.L. ... Defining T Cell States Associated with Response to Checkpoint Immunotherapy in Melanoma Cell. 2018; 175 :998-1013.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1016) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with the memory phenotype observed in peripheral CD8 + T cells of melanoma patients who had PFS-9, higher levels of stem-like memory T cell gene signatures were also seen in tumor biopsies from patients with PFS-9 compared to patients with progression ( Figure 3 C, upper panel). This was further corroborated by the presence of increased CD8 + TCF7 + T cells in the TME of patients with PFS-9 ( Figure 3 C, lower panel). Both the peripheral and tumor markers described above did not show changes when comparing pre-vaccine to pre-treatment samples or post-vaccine to pre-vaccine samples in patients with or without PFS-9.
We also investigated whether any germline markers correlated with PFS in each of the tumor cohorts. Notably, more melanoma patients with PFS-9 had at least one germline copy of the APOE4 genetic variant compared to patients with progression before the 9-month mark ( Figure S2 C) ( Tavazoie et al., 2018 68. Tavazoie, M.F. ∙ Pollack, I. ∙ Tanqueco, R. ... LXR/ApoE Activation Restricts Innate Immune Suppression in Cancer Cell. 2018; 172 :825-840.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, an opposite correlation to the presence of the APOE4 genetic variant was seen in the NSCLC cohort and no correlation was seen in the bladder cancer patients. Further validation of these observations should be addressed in future trials.
The immunogenicity of NEO-PV-01 plus nivolumab was evaluated in the peripheral blood by interferon γ (IFN-γ) ELISpot assay. Analysis of 570 vaccinating peptides across 34 patients with sufficient peripheral leukapheresis samples across all 3 time points (18 melanoma, 7 NSCLC, and 9 bladder cancer) revealed robust de novo immune responses to multiple vaccinating peptides in all of the patients (melanoma 52%, NSCLC 47%, and bladder cancer 52%; Figure 4 A). Of these, 42% were ex vivo responses detected in an overnight assay with added peptide and the remainder were detected after peptide stimulation in a 5-day assay, both without added cytokines (see Method Details ). Minimal neoantigen-specific T cell responses were detected at the pre-treatment and pre-vaccine time points, respectively ( Figures 4 A and S3 A–S3C). These data are consistent with previous studies indicating that preexisting responses to neoantigens in the periphery are rarely detected ( Ott et al., 2017 53. Ott, P.A. ∙ Hu, Z. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ... An immunogenic personal neoantigen vaccine for patients with melanoma Nature. 2017; 547 :217-221 Crossref Scopus (1897) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Similar proportions of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses were detected in all 3 cohorts, with an average of 42% and 24% of vaccinating peptides generating CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses, respectively ( Figure 4 A). Specificity of the vaccine-generated immune responses to the mutant epitope versus the wild-type epitope was tested using an IFN-γ ELISpot assay across a wide range of peptide concentrations. Reactivity of the mutant versus the wild-type epitope was seen preferentially in 12 (92%) of the 13 mutant epitopes tested ( Figure 4 B; Table S5 ). Persistence of these vaccine-induced responses was tested in blood samples obtained at week 52 after the start of the anti-PD-1 treatment, or ∼29 weeks after the last vaccine dose. Among the 193 neoepitopes tested in 12 melanoma, 4 NSCLC, and 4 bladder cancer patients, persistent immune responses were detected for 58% of the neoepitopes ( Figure 4 C). These responses included both CD4 + and CD8 + epitopes based on their detection in earlier (week 20) analyses. These data demonstrate that vaccination with NEO-PV-01 results in the generation of T cell responses that are specific and durable.
Detailed phenotypic analysis of neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses from selected patients with available samples revealed an activated and effector memory phenotype of these cells ( Figure S4 ). In addition, neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells from a patient who progressed on study had higher expression of multiple co-inhibitory receptors that was not seen in the neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from patients who achieved PFS-9 ( Figure S4 ). The cytotoxic phenotype of neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood was determined by the surface expression of CD107a, a marker for T cell degranulation ( Betts et al., 2003 9. Betts, M.R. ∙ Brenchley, J.M. ∙ Price, D.A. ... Sensitive and viable identification of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by a flow cytometric assay for degranulation J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 281 :65-78 Crossref Scopus (1341) PubMed Google Scholar ), when assayed in the presence of the neoantigen peptide. Among the 71 CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes tested across 21 patients (13 melanoma, 3 NSCLC, and 5 bladder), the surface expression of CD107a was detected in the presence of 58% of the epitopes at the post-vaccine time point ( Figures 5 A and S5 ).
To further elucidate the role of the vaccine-induced cytolytic T cell responses in anti-tumor responses, the presence of NEO-PV-01-specific T cells was assessed by TCR sequencing in both the peripheral blood and in serial tumor biopsies from 3 melanoma patients who achieved PFS-9. Patient M1 was a 67-year-old female metastatic melanoma patient who had liver and pre-sacral metastases and experienced stable disease for 24 months on the study. A CD8 + T cell response specific to a neoepitope in the RICTOR gene (IM24) was detected by tetramer analysis in PBMCs of this patient. IM24-specific CD8 + T cells represented ∼0.17% of all circulating CD8 + T cells post-vaccine and were not present pre-vaccination ( Figure 5 B, I). CD8 + T cells reactive to a control EBV epitope from the viral LMP2A protein were detected at all 3 time points at similar levels (∼0.04% CD8 + T cells; Figure S6 A). Further characterization of RICTOR mutant-specific CD8 + T cells revealed a memory phenotype, polyfunctionality, and cytolytic potential ( Figures 5 B, II, and S6 B). Single-cell sequencing of the TCR α and β chain loci was performed to identify the paired complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) regions and revealed 3 major clones ( Figure S6 C). We compared the CDR3β sequences of these clones to CDR3β sequences identified by targeted sequencing of bulk RNA from serial metastatic tumors. One of these three major clones (M1TCR3) was found to be enriched in the post-vaccine tumor and was absent at the pre-treatment or pre-vaccine time points ( Figure 5 B, III). The sequences from M1TCR3 were cloned and expressed in the patient’s pre-treatment CD8 + T cells. These transduced CD8 + T cells were assessed for killing of the cancer cell line A375 expressing the patient HLA allele when pulsed with either the wild-type or mutant neoepitope. Specific killing of the cancer cell line, as assessed by cleaved caspase-3 upregulation, was seen only in the presence of the mutant, but not the wild-type peptide ( Figure 5 B, IV).
Similarly, in patient M13, a 60-year-old male melanoma patient with lymph node metastases, who had a partial radiographic response to treatment, a functional cytolytic peripheral CD4 + T cell response specific to the immunizing peptide IM07 (frameshift mutation in the gene LGALS3BP) was detected following vaccination ( Figure 5 C, I). Further phenotypic analysis of IM07-specific T cells demonstrated that these cells were of the memory phenotype and could secrete multiple cytokines upon stimulation with the IM07 peptide ( Figure S6 D). Single-cell CDR3 TCR sequence analysis of these cells revealed multiple clones ( Figure S6 E), of which two were detected exclusively in the post-vaccine biopsy ( Figure 5 C, II). Subsequent expression of M13TCRs in TCR-deficient Jurkat T cells confirmed the specificity of these TCRs for IM07 in an interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion assay ( Figure 5 C, III). Cytotoxicity analysis of these IM07-specific CD4 + TCRs was limited because the MHC class II restriction of these TCRs was unknown. Additional neoantigen-specific TCRs were found in the biopsies at multiple time points in 2 patients (M13 and M14) who achieved PFS-9 ( Figure S6 F). These data demonstrate trafficking of neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells into the tumor.
Given the detection of memory and potentially cytolytic T cells in the tumor, we reasoned that the killing of tumor cells by neoantigen-specific T cells could release additional epitopes resulting in the generation of a broadened neoantigen-specific immune response. This phenomenon, known as epitope spreading, has been previously reported to be important for expanding the T cell responses to vaccines ( Corbière et al., 2011 23. Corbière, V. ∙ Chapiro, J. ∙ Stroobant, V. ... Antigen spreading contributes to MAGE vaccination-induced regression of melanoma metastases Cancer Res. 2011; 71 :1253-1262 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kreiter et al., 2015 41. Kreiter, S. ∙ Vormehr, M. ∙ van de Roemer, N. ... Mutant MHC class II epitopes drive therapeutic immune responses to cancer Nature. 2015; 520 :692-696 Crossref Scopus (910) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess whether epitope spread occurred after vaccination, we screened for the presence of peripheral T cell responses against epitopes that were highly ranked but were not included in the vaccine (referred to as “non-immunizing neoepitopes”). We assessed epitope spread in the two melanoma patients (patients M1 and M13) whose tumors were infiltrated with vaccine-induced neoantigen-specific T cells as assessed by single-cell TCR sequencing. Peripheral immune responses reactive against 4 of 15 and 3 of 13 non-immunizing neoepitopes were detected post-vaccination in patients M1 and M13, respectively ( Figure S6 G). Of note, these responses were not present pre-treatment or pre-vaccine, suggesting that the presence of epitope spread could be a surrogate marker for tumor cell killing by neoantigen-specific T cells induced by vaccination.
The presence of epitope spread was then evaluated across multiple patients with sufficient samples available for analysis. Among 330 non-immunizing neoepitopes tested across 13 melanoma, 5 NSCLC, and 7 bladder cancer patients, post-vaccine-specific immune responses were detected for 33 non-immunizing neoepitopes ( Table S6 ). These immune responses were not detected in the pre-vaccine or pre-treatment PBMCs. Notably, the extent of epitope spread responses was higher in patients who achieved PFS-9 or PFS-6, respectively, and correlated with longer PFS across all 3 cohorts ( Figure 5 D). It is possible that epitope spread could be a self-amplifying process, wherein dying tumor cells can trigger additional neoantigen-specific immune responses during the course of the treatment. This was indeed the case in patient M2, a 65-year-old male melanoma patient with gastric metastases, who experienced a clinical complete response at 66 weeks from the start of treatment. An expansion of epitope spread to 3 additional non-immunizing neoepitopes was detected at 52 weeks post-initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy ( Figure S6 H). Thus, the observation of epitope spread suggests that NEO-PV-01-induced T cells could be cytotoxic to tumor cells and thus expand the repertoire of T cell responses against tumor neoantigens.
The observation of epitope spread suggested that vaccination with NEO-PV-01 could lead to major changes in tumor cellularity post-vaccination. We were able to address this question in the melanoma cohort, where there were sufficient numbers of serial tumor samples available for this analysis. Tumor cellularity was evaluated in multiple longitudinal core biopsies by a blinded independent pathologist, and the highest percentage of tumor at each time point was recorded. Assessment of residual viable tumor (RVT) across the 3 longitudinal biopsies obtained from the same gastric lesion in patient M2 described above revealed the presence of considerable tumor at the pre-treatment (95%) and pre-vaccine (40%) biopsies ( Figure 6 A). However, there was no evidence of RVT in any of the 5 core biopsies obtained at the post-vaccine time point. Notably, increased infiltration of the tumor with CD3 + T cells was seen at the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine time points ( Figure 6 A).
Serial tumor biopsies from 19 melanoma patients who had tumor biopsies at all 3 time points from the same anatomical site were then assessed for pathological response in relation to treatment. Of the 19 patients, 5 had tumor present at all time points. At 12 weeks after initiation of nivolumab monotherapy (pre-vaccination), 5 of 19 patients (26%) achieved MPR (RVT < 5% in all of the biopsy cores), indicating response to nivolumab monotherapy in these patients ( Figure 6 B, left). At 12 weeks post-initiation of vaccine, 9 melanoma patients who had not achieved an MPR with nivolumab exhibited a post-vaccine MPR ( Figure 6 B, right; Table S7 ). Three of these patients had >80% tumor pre-vaccination. We note that the MPRs seen after vaccination could also represent delayed responses to nivolumab monotherapy. In addition, epitope spread data for 6 of the post-vaccine MPR patients were available, and 5 of them had epitope spread. Although these data are from a limited number of patients, they suggest an association of epitope spread with decreased tumor cellularity post-vaccine. Notably, all of the patients who exhibited MPR still had evidence of residual tumors by radiographic measurements, suggesting a disconnect between these measurements (3 SD, 10 PR, and 1 PD); there was no statistically significant correlation between MPR and best overall response by RESIST (p = 0.2098). However, the presence of MPR at any time point (n = 14) or seen only at the post-vaccine time point (n = 9) correlated with prolonged PFS compared to patients without MPR (n = 5; Figure 6 C).

Section: Discussion

Since neoantigens are specific for tumors versus normal tissues and thus are not subject to central tolerance, they provide excellent targets for the generation and amplification of immune responses to synergize with ICI therapy ( McGranahan et al., 2016 49.

In the phase Ib trial reported here, we extend earlier studies testing personalized vaccines as monotherapy in patients with melanoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) ( Carreno et al., 2015 16.

Furthermore, by studying serial tumor biopsies and PBMCs obtained pre-treatment, pre-vaccine, and post-vaccine, we were able to investigate the clinical, immune, and pathologic responses to this therapy.
We observed that radiographic responses deepened following treatment with the vaccine and were durable across all three cohorts. Of note, deepening of radiographic responses over time can be seen with nivolumab monotherapy. Comparison of all three cohorts treated with the combination of anti-PD-1 and NEO-PV-01 to historical data of anti-PD-1 monotherapy showed similar response rates, PFS, and OS ( Balar et al., 2017 6.

Med. 2017; 377 :1345-1356 Crossref Scopus (2658) PubMed Google Scholar ). The relevance of such comparisons with considerably larger randomized historical clinical studies remains to be determined, as does the role of the vaccine alone.
Approximately 25% of enrolled patients were unable to proceed to vaccination, the majority due to either disease progression or inability to generate vaccines because of low tumor content in the biopsy samples or a low number of mutations. Opportunities to mitigate this issue include acceleration of vaccine production timelines and the incorporation of potentially higher-yield tumor sampling approaches. Furthermore, the selection of alternative clinical settings can be envisioned, such as the adjuvant or minimal residual disease setting or a strategy that uses pre-manufacturing of personalized vaccines at an earlier point in the disease for use during a later line of treatment.
The ability to design effective neoantigen vaccines is dependent on having a rapid computational pipeline for DNA and RNA sequence analysis and epitope scoring and prioritization. In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based predictor ( Abelin et al., 2017 1. Abelin, J.G. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ∙ Sarkizova, S. ... Mass Spectrometry Profiling of HLA-Associated Peptidomes in Mono-allelic Cells Enables More Accurate Epitope Prediction Immunity. 2017; 46 :315-326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate epitope rankings that jointly considers expression, proteasomal processing potential, and HLA-I binding affinity ( Nielsen and Andreatta, 2016 51. Nielsen, M. ∙ Andreatta, M. NetMHCpan-3.0; improved prediction of binding to MHC class I molecules integrating information from multiple receptor and peptide length datasets Genome Med. 2016; 8 :33 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). This strategy yielded multiple CD8 + T cell responses in the majority of the patients, but, interestingly, it also yielded frequent CD4 + T cell responses despite the absence of the HLA-II binding prediction in the selection scheme. Similar observations have been made with previous neoantigen vaccines ( Ott et al., 2017 53. Ott, P.A. ∙ Hu, Z. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ... An immunogenic personal neoantigen vaccine for patients with melanoma Nature. 2017; 547 :217-221 Crossref Scopus (1897) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sahin et al., 2017 60. Sahin, U. ∙ Derhovanessian, E. ∙ Miller, M. ... Personalized RNA mutanome vaccines mobilize poly-specific therapeutic immunity against cancer Nature. 2017; 547 :222-226 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A recent study by our group indicated that class II presentation is mainly dependent on the presentation of these epitopes by dendritic cells ( Abelin et al., 2019 2. Abelin, J.G. ∙ Harjanto, D. ∙ Malloy, M. ... Defining HLA-II Ligand Processing and Binding Rules with Mass Spectrometry Enhances Cancer Epitope Prediction Immunity. 2019; 51 :766-779.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, the generation of CD4 + T cells is likely due to exogenous loading of peptides used in the vaccine since their size ranged from 14 to 35 amino acids, which is consistent with the length distribution of presented class II epitopes. Recent data suggest a critical role for CD4 + T cells in tumor control in pre-clinical tumor models ( Alspach et al., 2019 3. Alspach, E. ∙ Lussier, D.M. ∙ Miceli, A.P. ... MHC-II neoantigens shape tumour immunity and response to immunotherapy Nature. 2019; 574 :696-701 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kreiter et al., 2015 41. Kreiter, S. ∙ Vormehr, M. ∙ van de Roemer, N. ... Mutant MHC class II epitopes drive therapeutic immune responses to cancer Nature. 2015; 520 :692-696 Crossref Scopus (910) PubMed Google Scholar ). Endogenous CD4 + T cell responses against neoantigens have been observed previously in patients with melanoma, and neoantigen-reactive CD4 + T cells have been shown to mediate clinical regression of tumor lesions upon adoptive transfer in a patient with cholangiocarcinoma ( Tran et al., 2014 72. Tran, E. ∙ Turcotte, S. ∙ Gros, A. ... Cancer immunotherapy based on mutation-specific CD4+ T cells in a patient with epithelial cancer Science. 2014; 344 :641-645 Crossref Scopus (1322) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, we observed that post-vaccine peripheral CD4 + T cells upregulated CD107a in response to stimulation with many of the vaccine neoantigen peptides, indicating their cytolytic capacity.
Another aspect of the immune responses generated by NEO-PV-01 was their phenotype and specificity. T cells generated by the vaccines exhibited a memory phenotype, had cytotoxic potential, were mutant specific and durable, and could migrate to the tumor. An interesting observation was the differential expression of co-inhibitory receptors in neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells induced by the vaccine in patients who achieved PFS-9 or PFS-6, respectively, versus those who did not, and will require further validation. In summary, our data suggest that vaccine-induced T cells exhibited properties that would be expected in a T cell population that could mediate tumor-specific immune killing.
Epitope spread was correlated with PFS in patients across all three tumors. This observation is important for several reasons. First, it suggests that the neoantigen-induced T cells generated by NEO-PV-01 are not only capable of trafficking to the tumor but also are potentially able to kill tumor cells, leading to the release of additional neoantigens that become targets for additional T cells. The data suggest that it may only be necessary to target a subset of neoantigens expressed by the tumor to generate a broad immune response against the expressed neoantigens ( Corbière et al., 2011 23. Corbière, V. ∙ Chapiro, J. ∙ Stroobant, V. ... Antigen spreading contributes to MAGE vaccination-induced regression of melanoma metastases Cancer Res. 2011; 71 :1253-1262 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). The generation of epitope spread may help to control tumor cells that do not express truncal neoantigens and thus could be a mechanism to control tumor heterogeneity.
Finally, we addressed the ability of the combination of NEO-PV-01 and anti-PD-1 to induce MPR in melanoma patients. Two patterns of MPR were noted in this analysis of 19 melanoma patients, all of whom had biopsies from the same site at all 3 time points. One group of patients (n = 5) had MPR after initial therapy with nivolumab alone. A second group of patients (n = 9) who had no or only partial pathologic responses after nivolumab, achieved MPR post-vaccination. While not directly comparable to the metastatic disease setting, given that in our study only core biopsies were examined rather than completely surgically resected disease, it is also worth noting that major or complete pathological responses were recently found to be strongly associated with superior clinical outcomes in patients with resectable stage III melanoma who received PD-1 inhibitors ( Cottrell et al., 2018 24. Cottrell, T.R. ∙ Thompson, E.D. ∙ Forde, P.M. ... Pathologic features of response to neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 in resected non-small-cell lung carcinoma: a proposal for quantitative immune-related pathologic response criteria (irPRC) Ann. Oncol. 2018; 29 :1853-1860 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ; Huang et al., 2019 36. Huang, A.C. ∙ Orlowski, R.J. ∙ Xu, X. ... A single dose of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade predicts clinical outcomes in resectable melanoma Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :454-461 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ; Topalian et al., 2020 71. Topalian, S.L. ∙ Taube, J.M. ∙ Pardoll, D.M. Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade for cancer immunotherapy Science. 2020; 367 :eaax0182 Crossref Scopus (526) PubMed Google Scholar ) or combined PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting ( Blank et al., 2018 11. Blank, C.U. ∙ Rozeman, E.A. ∙ Fanchi, L.F. ... Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab in macroscopic stage III melanoma Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1655-1661 Crossref Scopus (582) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A limitation of our study is its single-arm design. Since the treatment was a combination of the neoantigen vaccine and anti-PD-1 and there was no nivolumab monotherapy comparator cohort, the deepening of radiographic responses, epitope spread, and major pathologic responses observed after vaccination cannot definitively be linked to the vaccine. Randomized trials of neoantigen-directed therapy plus anti-PD-1 versus anti-PD-1 monotherapy will be necessary to confirm these findings and determine the specific contribution of the personalized neoantigen vaccine.
In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility and safety of this personalized neoantigen-based vaccine in combination with anti-PD-1 to generate de novo neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells that have a cytotoxic phenotype and are capable of trafficking to the tumor. We also observed epitope spread and evidence for major pathological responses in post-vaccination tumor biopsies. The potential to use peripheral blood and tumor biomarkers to select patients for the design of future randomized studies holds promise. These additional studies will be needed to better refine this approach and determine whether personalized neoantigen vaccines in combination with anti-PD-1 may play a role in the therapy of cancer patients.

All vaccine peptide and immune assay peptide sequences are provided in Table S8 . Patient sequencing information will be provided for patients consistent with their institutional informed consent. Epitope selection utilized previously published algorithms and methods as described in the STAR Methods .
Details of the study can be found in the attached clinical study protocol NT-001 and patient demographics can be found in Table 1 . Nine clinical sites enrolled patients including Dana Farber Cancer Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Massachusetts General Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of California Los Angeles, University of California San Francisco, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Washington University School of Medicine. Patients who were 18 years of age or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic melanoma, NSCLC or UC of the bladder, urethra, ureter or renal pelvis were eligible for enrollment in this multicenter phase I clinical trial (NCT02897765, also known as NT001). No statistical methods were used to pre-determine the sample size for each of the three tumor cohorts. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with approval by the Institutional Review Board at each participating site and written informed consent was obtained for all patients. Key eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and life expectancy of at least 6 months. Excluded from the study were patients with untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, active or history of autoimmune disease, and patients who had received previous therapy with ICI other than cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibition for melanoma and intra-vesical BCG for urothelial carcinoma.
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate safety of administering NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant (poly-ICLC) with nivolumab. The relationship of an adverse event to study treatments was determined according to clinical judgement of the clinical investigators. The secondary objective was to determine the anti-tumor activity of the combination as assessed by objective response rate and the exploratory objective was to determine the vaccine induced immune responses. The clinical characteristics for these patients are included in Table 1 . NEO-PV-01 is a personalized vaccine composed of up to 20 synthesized peptides that are between 14 and 35 amino acids in length. The peptides are divided into up to four individual pools, each pool consisting of 1 to 5 peptides. On the day of vaccination, each pool of NEO-PV-01 was mixed with the adjuvant polyinosinic polycytidylic acid polylysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC; Hiltonol®) for a concentration of 300 μg/mL of each peptide. Each patient was scheduled to receive 5 doses of vaccination during the priming phase (on days 1 and 4 of week 12) and then weekly for 3 weeks (weeks 13, 14, and 15), followed by 2 booster vaccinations at weeks 19 and 23. Each pool was administered by subcutaneous injection in one of the four limbs or left or right midriff as alternative anatomical locations. The anatomical site of injection for each pool was constant through the vaccination regimen. Patients were allowed to start vaccination with NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant poly-ICLC regardless of disease status. Nivolumab at 240 mg flat dose was administered i.v. every 2 weeks starting on study day 1.
Adverse events, laboratory values, ECG, and vital signs were assessed regularly and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Response was assessed at weeks 8 and 12 and subsequently every 12 weeks according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 based on investigator assessment.
Eighty-two patients were enrolled on the study. These included 34 patients with melanoma (68% male), 27 patients with NSCLC (44% male), and 21 patients with bladder cancer (71% male). Leukaphereses, blood, and serum samples were obtained from study participants throughout treatment. Leukaphereses were obtained at pre-treatment, pre-vaccine (week 10-12) and post-vaccine (week 20). Blood and plasma samples were obtained at weeks 6, 14, 16 and 24. Patient PBMCs were isolated within 4h after blood collection using Ficoll-paque (GE Healthcare) density-gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved in Recovery Cell Culture Freezing Medium (Invitrogen). PBMCs were stored in vapor-phase liquid nitrogen and plasma samples were stored at −80°C until time of analysis.
Tumor samples (surgical and core-needle biopsies) were obtained at pre-treatment, pre-vaccine (week 10-12) and post-vaccine (week 24). Samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for at least 18 and no more than 30h and then processed and embedded in paraffin by traditional vacuum infiltration tissue processing techniques. Pre-treatment biopsies were used for generation of NEO-PV-01 and were advanced for DNA and RNA sequencing only if 5 cores or 100mm 3 were available and if pathology review indicated a tumor cellularity ≥ 30%. If none of the core biopsies met the minimum 30% tumor cellularity, enrichment by macro-dissection may have been performed. In several instances, archival biopsies were permitted, if they had been obtained within 180 days of patient consent and if there had been no intercurrent therapy.
WES (library protocol: ACE(TM) Cancer Research Exome, Personalis, Menlo Park, CA) and RNA-Seq (library protocol: ACE(TM) Cancer Research Transcriptome, Personalis, Menlo Park, CA) libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq in a CLIA/CAP accredited laboratory (Personalis, Menlo Park, CA). WES was conducted on a tumor sample and a normal blood sample per patient (depths: 158-347 reads and 65-289 reads, respectively); RNA-Seq was conducted on tumor samples only (depth: 94-547 reads).
The HLA-A and HLA-B genotype of each patient was determined by amplifying informative exons by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using locus-specific primers. Dye-terminator sequencing fragments from the PCR fragments were analyzed on a capillary sequencer to determine nucleotide sequences for each haplotype (BloodCenter of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI).
All computational analysis steps were conducted using an automated analysis pipeline hosted on a cloud computing platform (Seven Bridges Genomics, Charlestown, MA).
Tumor and germline WES and tumor RNA-Seq FASTQs were aligned to the human genome (Gencode V19) using the BWA-MEM (version 0.7.13) ( Li and Durbin, 2009 46. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (31658) PubMed Google Scholar ) and STAR (version 2.5.1.b), respectively. All alignments were post-processed with the GATK 3.5 workflow ( McKenna et al., 2010 50. McKenna, A. ∙ Hanna, M. ∙ Banks, E. ... The Genome Analysis Toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data Genome Res. 2010; 20 :1297-1303 Crossref Scopus (17473) PubMed Google Scholar ) including GATK Indel Realigner, GATK Base Recalibrator, and Picard Mark Duplicates (version 1.140). ConTest ( Cibulskis et al., 2011 20. Cibulskis, K. ∙ McKenna, A. ∙ Fennell, T. ... ContEst: estimating cross-contamination of human samples in next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :2601-2602 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to confirm that all three samples originated from the same individual.
Somatic variants were called on the basis of tumor and normal WES using an ensemble of seven different mutation calling algorithms: VarDict (version 1.4.6) ( Lai et al., 2016 43. Lai, Z. ∙ Markovets, A. ∙ Ahdesmaki, M. ... VarDict: a novel and versatile variant caller for next-generation sequencing in cancer research Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :e108 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar ), Strelka (version 1.0.15) ( Saunders et al., 2012 61. Saunders, C.T. ∙ Wong, W.S. ∙ Swamy, S. ... Strelka: accurate somatic small-variant calling from sequenced tumor-normal sample pairs Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :1811-1817 Crossref Scopus (1123) PubMed Google Scholar ), VarScan2 (version 2.3.9) ( Koboldt et al., 2012 40. Koboldt, D.C. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Larson, D.E. ... VarScan 2: somatic mutation and copy number alteration discovery in cancer by exome sequencing Genome Res. 2012; 22 :568-576 Crossref Scopus (3360) PubMed Google Scholar ), Mutect2 (from the GATK version 3.5 bundle) ( Cibulskis et al., 2013 21. Cibulskis, K. ∙ Lawrence, M.S. ∙ Carter, S.L. ... Sensitive detection of somatic point mutations in impure and heterogeneous cancer samples Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31 :213-219 Crossref Scopus (3317) PubMed Google Scholar ), Atlas Indel2 (version 1.4.3) ( Challis et al., 2012 18. Challis, D. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Evani, U.S. ... An integrative variant analysis suite for whole exome next-generation sequencing data BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13 :8 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), Seurat (version 2.6) ( Christoforides et al., 2013 19. Christoforides, A. ∙ Carpten, J.D. ∙ Weiss, G.J. ... Identification of somatic mutations in cancer through Bayesian-based analysis of sequenced genome pairs BMC Genomics. 2013; 14 :302 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Platypus (version 0.8.1) ( Rimmer et al., 2014 55. Rimmer, A. ∙ Phan, H. ∙ Mathieson, I. ..., WGS500 Consortium Integrating mapping-, assembly- and haplotype-based approaches for calling variants in clinical sequencing applications Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :912-918 Crossref Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ). The three sequencing datasets were then realigned using HaplotypeCaller (from the GATK version 3.5 bundle), specifying the candidate mutations (union of the seven call sets) as known variants. Finally, the variants were filtered according the following features: the level of read support in the tumor WES data, the presence of variant reads in the normal WES data, read orientation bias, adequacy of coverage in the normal WES sample, the presence of neighboring (+/−30nt) variants (somatic or germline), and read quality bias observed in mutation-supporting reads.
RNA-Seq expression levels of all genes and transcripts were quantified in transcripts per million (TPM) using RSEM (version 1.2.31) ( Li and Dewey, 2011 45. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13399) PubMed Google Scholar ). The overall expression of each somatic variant was calculated as the product of the RSEM-derived transcript expression (summing across all overlapping protein-coding transcripts) and the fraction of RNA-Seq reads supporting the variant. Variants with zero supporting RNA reads were still considered as valid mutations (and counted toward tumor mutation burden) but were not considered for inclusion in vaccine. RNA-Seq was additionally processed using STAR-Fusion (version 2.5.1.b) ( Haas et al., 2017 14. Haas, B.J. ∙ Dobin, A. ∙ Stransky, N. ... STAR-Fusion: Fast and Accurate Fusion Transcript Detection from RNA-Seq bioRxiv. 2017; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) to identify transcript fusions (requiring both junction support and spanning read pairs).
In the event that an adequate RNA library could not be prepared (patients: B9 and M17), fusion calling was skipped and reference expression was obtained from TCGA samples with high tumor purity (as assessed by Absolute; five samples per tumor type) ( Carter et al., 2012 17. Carter, S.L. ∙ Cibulskis, K. ∙ Helman, E. ... Absolute quantification of somatic DNA alterations in human cancer Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :413-421 Crossref Scopus (1404) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since these patients lacked RNA-Seq as a filter against false positive mutation calls, their somatic variants were required to have a higher level of read support in the tumor WES and to have been identified by more than one mutation caller.
Patients with at least 50 non-synonymous point mutations and/or gene fusions were advanced to the vaccine design step. The vaccine peptides, also referred to as immunizing (IM) peptides, were identified by selecting 6 peptides on the basis of HLA-I presentation scores (also referred to as epitope quality scores, see below), 2 peptides based on high expression, and 2 peptides based on highly expressed frameshifts, iteratively until the full roster of 30 peptides was completed. HLA-I epitopes were required to have a NetMHCpan (version 3.0) percent rank lower than 2%, and the latter two epitope classes were required to have expression levels > 10 TPM and > 5 TPM, respectively (if none were available, the slots were ceded to HLA-I selections). Generally, each mutation was targeted by only one vaccine peptide and excluded from subsequent selections unless the span of novel sequence generated could not be covered by a single peptide (as can happen with frameshifts) or if the likelihood of manufacturing success was questionable for the first peptide per known synthesis constraints. The trade-off between synthesis constraints and immune-related scoring further dictated the relative length of the vaccine peptides (allowable range: 14-35 amino acids) and whether they were centered or shifted with respect to the site of mutation.
HLA-I presentation scores were determined based on a logistic regression that considered binding affinity (NetMHCpan-3.0 percent rank) ( Nielsen and Andreatta, 2016 51. Nielsen, M. ∙ Andreatta, M. NetMHCpan-3.0; improved prediction of binding to MHC class I molecules integrating information from multiple receptor and peptide length datasets Genome Med. 2016; 8 :33 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), allele-specific expression, and proteasomal cleavage potential (using a previously described prediction approach); the weights of the logistic regression were optimized according to mass spectrometry data as previously described ( Abelin et al., 2017 1. Abelin, J.G. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ∙ Sarkizova, S. ... Mass Spectrometry Profiling of HLA-Associated Peptidomes in Mono-allelic Cells Enables More Accurate Epitope Prediction Immunity. 2017; 46 :315-326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). The score of a candidate vaccine peptide was determined by summing all the relevant peptide-allele combinations (epitopes lengths 8-11; HLA-A and HLA-B alleles only).
Secondary characteristics were used to up-weight and down-weight candidate epitopes but were purposely tuned to have less importance than the above-mentioned factors. Thus, all other parameters being equal, the selection algorithm favored more clonal epitopes (higher mutant allele fraction) over sub-clonal epitopes, frameshifts over point mutations, oncogenes over passenger genes, and peptides with good manufacturing scores over those with poor predicted manufacturability. Our scoring system did not consider the relative binding scores of wild-type peptides or similarity to known pathogen sequences ( Łuksza et al., 2017 48. Łuksza, M. ∙ Riaz, N. ∙ Makarov, V. ... A neoantigen fitness model predicts tumour response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy Nature. 2017; 551 :517-520 Crossref Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar ) .
The GMP grade peptides of NEO-PV-01 were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) on automated parallel peptide synthesizers. 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry was employed. After the assembly of the peptide chains, the peptides were removed from the resins using cleavage cocktails containing trifluoroacetic acid and scavengers. The peptides were precipitated and washed with ether. After drying, the crude peptides were purified on automated preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep HPLC) systems with ultraviolet (UV) and mass spectrometry (MS) detectors. The prep HPLC fractions were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-UV/MS systems to determine molecular weights (MW) and purities. The fractions containing the target peptides and desired purities were lyophilized to solid powders with the final purities equal to or higher than 95%. Up to 20 peptides per vaccine were formulated in a buffered aqueous solution containing 4% DMSO in isotonic dextrose and mixed into up to four pools, each containing up to five peptides. The pooled peptide solutions were filtered through 0.22 μm filters for sterilization. The vaccines were analyzed for identity (molecular weights based on UPLC-UV/MS analysis), sterility, endotoxin, and strength before their releases from the GMP manufacturing site. The amino- and carboxyl-termini of the peptides are free amines and carboxylic acids respectively, without structural modifications.
The peptides for in vitro immune response studies were synthesized using SPPS on computer-controlled high-throughput peptide synthesizers. The peptides were assembled on resins by employing Fmoc-chemistry. The chemical cleavages of peptides from the resins were performed by using TFA solution containing scavengers followed by peptide precipitation and washes with diethyl ether. The assay peptides (ASP) were purified on automated prep HPLC systems equipped with UV and MS detectors. The prep HPLC fractions of each peptide that met the molecular weight (MW) and purity criteria based on UPLC-UV/MS analysis were pooled and dried using either parallel centrifugal evaporators or lyophilizers. The epitope peptides (EPT) were resuspended in acetonitrile and water and dried on a lyophilizer after diethyl ether washes and analyzed for required purity and MW by using UPLC-UV/MS. Assay peptides (ASP) were 13-15 amino acids and overlapped by at least 9 amino acids to cover the immunizing peptide (IM) sequence or were 8-11 amino acids and predicted to bind class I ( Ott et al., 2017 53. Ott, P.A. ∙ Hu, Z. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ... An immunogenic personal neoantigen vaccine for patients with melanoma Nature. 2017; 547 :217-221 Crossref Scopus (1897) PubMed Google Scholar ). All assay peptide sequences are provided in Table S8 .
For ex vivo assays, patient PBMCs were rested overnight at 2 × 10 6 cells/mL in X-Vivo media (Lonza) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO). For neoantigen pre-exposure assays, patient PBMCs were rested overnight and cultured with individual peptides (2 μM) or pooled peptides (2 μM per peptide) for 5 days at a density of 5x10 6 cells/ml in a 24-well plate. On day 3 of culture, half the well volume was replaced with fresh media. All immunizing peptides were tested in both the ex vivo as well as in the 5-day stimulation with the neoantigen peptide assay formats. Immunizing peptides are referred to as IM followed by the peptide number.
IFN-γ ELISpot assays were performed using 96-well MultiScreen Filter Plates (Millipore) and the Ready-Set-Go! Human IFN-γ ELISpot Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were coated overnight at 4°C with anti-IFNγ Capture Antibody diluted in 1X Coating Buffer, washed with 1X Coating Buffer and blocked with X-Vivo media (Lonza) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO) for 1h. For ex vivo ELISpots, PBMCs were plated in triplicate with 1 × 10 6 cells per well. For cells that were pre-exposed to peptide, cells were washed and plated in triplicate with 1 × 10 5 cells per well. Peptides were added to ELISpot wells at 2 μM per peptide. Each plate included a healthy donor positive and negative control with the CEF viral peptide pool (JPT) and Cell Stimulation Cocktail (Life Technologies) to confirm reagent performance. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. Plates were washed 3 times using PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and detection antibody diluted in 1X ELISpot diluent was added to wells for 2h. After washing 3 times with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20, Avidin-HRP was diluted in 1X ELISpot diluent and added to wells for 45 min. Plates were washed with both PBS with Tween-20 and PBS 3 times. AEC substrate-chromogen (BD Biosciences) was then added for 20 min. Plates were rinsed with deionized water 3 times and allowed to dry at room temperature overnight. Spots were imaged and enumerated using an Immunospot analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited). Responses were characterized as positive if spot-forming cell count detected was at least 10 spots over the DMSO control and +3 standard deviations and confirmed in repeat experiments.
CD3 + T cells were isolated from patient PBMCs by negative selection using the Pan T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi). Both the CD3 + and CD3 - populations were collected, washed, and counted after isolation. The CD3- population was used as APCs (antigen presenting cells) for this assay. The CD3 + population then underwent CD4 + positive isolation using CD4 + microbeads (Miltenyi). Both the CD4 + (positive-selection) and CD8 + (negative-selection) T cells were collected, washed, and counted. A co-culture containing APCs and either CD4 + or CD8 + cells at a ratio of 3:1, 2:1, or 1:1 were plated in a 96-well flat bottom polystyrene plate for 24-48h. Peptide was added directly to wells, in triplicate, at 2 μM per peptide. If the T cells were pre-exposed to neoantigen peptide for 5-6 days, CD3 - APCs were isolated from fresh patient PBMCs using CD3 microbeads (Miltenyi). Supernatants were collected at the end of the coculture and frozen at −80°C until use.
The Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) U-Plex system was used to detect 10 distinct analytes from the coculture supernatants. The analytes measured were: IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17a, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. MSD 10-plex plates were coated with the linker-antibody solution for 1h with shaking at room temperature. The plates were then washed 3 times with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 on a BioTek plate washer. Supernatant and standards were diluted 1:2 and added to the plate for 1h with shaking at room temperature. Plates were washed again with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 before the addition of the detection antibody solution for 1h. Plates were washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and 2X Read Buffer (MSD) was added to the plates for detection on the MSD SECTOR S 600 instrument. Concentration in pg/mL was calculated by the MSD Discovery Workbench software by comparing luminescent signal of the patient samples against the known standard curve. CD4 + and CD8 + positive responses were determined separately based on the corresponding DMSO controls. A positive signal was determined by an IFN-γ signal 1.5-fold higher than the DMSO control.
Recombinant pMHC-I monomers with UV cleavable conditional ligands were prepared for analysis of vaccine-induced neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells. The gene sequences of the human class I HLA heavy chains were identified from the IPD-IMGT/HLA webpage ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla ) and codon-optimized for expression in E. coli using commercially available algorithms (Genewiz). The extracellular domain of class I heavy chain (amino acid residues 1-276) was fused to a C-terminal GSGGSGGSAGG linker and a GLNDIFEAQKIEWH biotinylation tag and cloned via the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites into the bacterial expression vector pET22b (Millipore Sigma). The human β2 m sequence (amino acid residues 1-99) was cloned into pET22b via the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites.
The HLA heavy chains were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells (NEB) grown in LB media at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.8 followed by induction with 1 mM Isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4h. The human β2 m protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells grown in Studier ZYM-5052 auto-induction medium at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.8 followed by a temperature shift to 20°C for overnight growth. Both proteins accumulate in inclusion bodies which were isolated from the E. coli cells using a previously described protocol and solubilized in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 8M Urea for subsequent refolding ( Rodenko et al., 2006 57. Rodenko, B. ∙ Toebes, M. ∙ Hadrup, S.R. ... Generation of peptide-MHC class I complexes through UV-mediated ligand exchange Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :1120-1132 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). UV conditional ligand (CL) peptide-loaded pMHC-I monomers were refolded by mixing 3 μM class I heavy chain with 6 μM β2 m and 10 μM CL peptide in refolding buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 400 mM L-arginine, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 15% glycerol, 3 mM PMSF and 1X CompleteTM EDTA free-protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)) and incubated at 4°C for 5 days ( Garboczi et al., 1992 27. Garboczi, D.N. ∙ Hung, D.T. ∙ Wiley, D.C. HLA-A2-peptide complexes: refolding and crystallization of molecules expressed in Escherichia coli and complexed with single antigenic peptides Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89 :3429-3433 Crossref Scopus (579) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rodenko et al., 2006 57. Rodenko, B. ∙ Toebes, M. ∙ Hadrup, S.R. ...

Toebes, M. ∙ Coccoris, M. ∙ Bins, A. ... Design and use of conditional MHC class I ligands Nat. Med. 2006; 12 :246-251 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). The refolded trimetric HLA complex was subsequently buffer exchanged on a SARTOFLOW-R (Sartorius) crossflow system against 20 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 25 mM NaCl, 15% glycerol and loaded on a HiTrap Q HP anion exchange chromatography column followed by elution with a continuous salt gradient elution to 500 mM NaCl on a ÄKTAPurifier system (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing refolded pMHC-I monomers were identified, pooled and concentrated to 60 μM in 500 mM Bicine, pH 8.3. 100 mM ATP, 100 mM MgOAc, 1 mM biotin for biotinylation for 3h at 30°C with 1 μM recombinant BirA ( Abelin et al., 2019 2. Abelin, J.G. ∙ Harjanto, D. ∙ Malloy, M. ... Defining HLA-II Ligand Processing and Binding Rules with Mass Spectrometry Enhances Cancer Epitope Prediction Immunity. 2019; 51 :766-779.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reaction mixture was then concentrated to 5 mL and loaded on a Yarra S2000 (Phenomenex) column equilibrated in 1xPBS+16% (v/v) glycerol to separate the biotinylated pMHC-I monomers from other components of the biotinylation reaction by size exclusion chromatography on a ÄKTAPurifier system (GE Healthcare). The pMHC-I monomer product was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and stored at −80°C until further use.
Peptide MHC multimers were generated by irradiating UV-cleavable monomers (0.1mg/mL) in the presence of EPT (9-12 amino acids) peptides (10mM in DMSO) at a 1:50 ratio under UV light (365 nm) at 4°C for 1h, followed by a 1h incubation at 37°C. Exchanged monomers were centrifuged at 3600RPM for 10 min. The exchanged monomer supernatant was incubated with fluorochrome conjugated streptavidin antibodies on ice for 30 min in the dark. Excess biotin (1:20 dilution) was added after incubation and exchanged fluorochrome-conjugated multimers were stored at 4°C until staining.
Patient PBMCs were treated with benzonase and dasatinib, both at a 1:1000 dilution, and were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Samples were centrifuged at 1500RPM for 5 min, washed once in FACS buffer containing dasatinib, and resuspended with the pooled multimer mixture at a final staining volume of 50 μL per sample with FACS buffer containing dasatinib. Samples were incubated with multimers at 37°C for 15 min, and subsequently stained with the appropriate surface antibodies for 30 min on ice. After incubation, samples were washed once with FACS buffer containing dasatinib and resuspended in 200 μL FACS buffer containing dasatinib. Samples were acquired on a BD LSR Fortessa instrument.
For ex vivo detection, patient PBMCs were recalled with 2 μM peptide or DMSO for 6 or 24h. For patient PBMCs pre-exposed to neoantigen peptide, CD3 - APCs were isolated from fresh PBMCs using CD3 microbeads (Miltenyi) and co-cultured with CD3 + T cells at a T cell:APC ratio of 2:1 and recalled with 2 μM peptide or DMSO for 6 or 24h. Anti-CD107a antibody was added 6h prior to the end of co-culture. GolgiStop/Plug (BD Biosciences) were added 4h prior to the end of co-culture. Subsequently, cells were stained with cell surface antibodies at 4°C for 30 min, followed by fixation/permeabilization with Fixation and Permeabilization Solution (BD Biosciences), and subsequently stained with antibodies against intracellular proteins at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were stored in FACS buffer at 4°C until acquisition on a BD LSR Fortessa instrument.
For intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), patient PBMCs were stimulated with 2 μM peptide or DMSO for 6 or 24h. GolgiStop/Plug (BD Biosciences) were added 4-5h prior to end of recall period with peptide. For phenotyping, patient PBMCs were treated with dasatinib at a 1:1000 dilution in X-Vivo media (Lonza) at 37°C for 30-60 min followed by staining with tetramers (if applicable) at 4°C for 30 min. For both assays, patient PBMCs were treated with benzonase (Millipore) at a 1:1000 dilution in X-Vivo media (Lonza) at 37°C for 30-60 min, followed by staining of surface antibodies. Cells were fixed at 20°C for 30 min using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) for phenotyping, and with the Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilization Buffer Set (eBioscience) for ICS, and subsequently stained for intracellular proteins at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were stored in FACS buffer at 4°C until acquisition on a BD LSR Fortessa instrument.
Patient PBMCs were treated with benzonase (Millipore) at a 1:1000 dilution in X-Vivo media (Lonza) at 37°C for 30 min. A total of 2 × 10 6 cells per sample were plated for flow staining and washed once with FACS buffer (PBS + 0.5% BSA). Cells were then incubated with cell surface antibodies for 30 min on ice, followed by a wash with FACS buffer. Cells were fixed and permeabilized for intracellular staining using either the BD cyofix/cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) or Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 20 min on ice. Cells were then incubated with intracellular antibodies in the corresponding permeabilization wash buffer for 30 min on ice, washed with the appropriate permeabilization wash buffer and followed by a final wash with FACS buffer. Cells were stored in FACS buffer at 4°C until acquisition on a BD LSR Fortessa instrument.
For FFPE tumor blocks, 2-4 scrolls of 20 μM thickness were deparaffinized using heptane and RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit according to the manufacturers’ instructions (QIAGEN). For PBMC samples, CD3 + T cells were isolated using the Pan T cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi) and subjected to RNA extraction using RNeasy Plus Mini or Micro Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN). RNA was quantified using the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturers’ instruction. Quality and size distribution of extracted RNA was determined on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using either the RNA 6000 Nano Kit or RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent).
Bulk TCR sequencing was performed on RNA samples extracted from patient FFPE tumor blocks and CD3 + T cell enriched PBMCs. Up to 1 ug of RNA was submitted to iRepertoire for targeted TCR sequencing ( Wang et al., 2010 76. Wang, C. ∙ Sanders, C.M. ∙ Yang, Q. ... High throughput sequencing reveals a complex pattern of dynamic interrelationships among human T cell subsets Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :1518-1523 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ) or processed according to iRepertoire protocol and sequenced using Illumina sequencers at a depth of ∼1 million reads per sample. BCL files were converted to FASTQ format. The first three bases of each read were trimmed, and the samples were then demultiplexed using either through the Illumina built-in software or the fastq-multx function from the ea-utils package ( Aronesty, 2011 4. Aronesty, E. ea-utils: “Command-line tools for processing biological sequencing data. GitHub, 2011 https://expressionanalysis.github.io/ea-utils/ Google Scholar ). TCR repertoire data were generated from raw demultiplexed data using MiXCR, version 3.0.12, ( Bolotin et al., 2015 12. Bolotin, D.A. ∙ Poslavsky, S. ∙ Mitrophanov, I. ... MiXCR: software for comprehensive adaptive immunity profiling Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :380-381 Crossref Scopus (979) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of TCR repertoire characteristics and features was performed in the R environment for statistical computing. Unless specifically stated, analyses were performed on the amino acid (AA) TCRbeta-CDR3 clonotypes, aggregating counts from various nucleotide CDR3 sequences encoding the same AA CDR3. Non-functional (out-of-frame or containing stop codons) CDR3 were excluded.
The unbiased gini coefficient, indicating the inequality in the AA CDR3 frequency distribution, was calculated using the “Gini” function from the DescTools package ( Signorell et al., 2016 67. Signorell, A. ∙ Aho, K.A. ∙ Alfons, A. ... DescTools: tools for descriptive statistics 2016 https://rdrr.io/cran/DescTools/man/DescTools-package.html Google Scholar ), using the counts of all detected functional AA CDR3 clonotypes in each sample. The unbiased gini coefficient ranges from “0” (complete equality) to “1” (complete inequality).
The DE50 coefficient, a diversity and clonality index representing the minimal number of clones to cover half of the overall frequency space, was calculated by ranking the clones based on their AA CDR3 frequency from high to low. The rank of the clone was then obtained at which the cumulative frequency reaches 50% of the total sum of repertoire frequencies with low numbers indicating high clonality. The DE50 is the obtained rank divided by the maximal rank of the sample (the number of unique AA CDR3 clonotypes).
For single-cell TCR sequencing (scTCRseq), patient PBMCs were sorted in 96-well plates either based on tetramer staining or staining with T cell activation markers (CD69, CD107a, CD25, PD-1) after neoantigen peptide exposure for 5-6 days and recall for 6-24h. Final sort gates for neoantigen-reactive subpopulations were determined based on control tetramer staining or control cocultures with DMSO. Plates were submitted to iRepertoire for scTCRseq (iPair-TCR). Paired sequencing information was used to determine clonal composition of sorted cell populations and candidate alpha/beta chain pairs were tested for neoantigen-reactivity after lentivirus-based T cell transductions ( Banu et al., 2014 7. Banu, N. ∙ Chia, A. ∙ Ho, Z.Z. ... Building and optimizing a virus-specific T cell receptor library for targeted immunotherapy in viral infections Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :4166 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar )
Second generation lentivirus vectors were generated on 293FT producer cell lines using shuttle plasmids (GenScript) containing TCR beta and alpha chains under the control of a SFFV promoter and separated by a furin cleavage site and a P2A ribosomal skip sequence. Human TCR variable regions were fused to cysteine-modified mouse constant regions for both chains resulting in recombinant mTCR ( Cohen et al., 2006 22. Cohen, C.J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Zheng, Z. ... Enhanced antitumor activity of murine-human hybrid T-cell receptor (TCR) in human lymphocytes is associated with improved pairing and TCR/CD3 stability Cancer Res. 2006; 66 :8878-8886 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuball et al., 2007 42. Kuball, J. ∙ Dossett, M.L. ∙ Wolfl, M. ... Facilitating matched pairing and expression of TCR chains introduced into human T cells Blood. 2007; 109 :2331-2338 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neoantigen-reactivity of mTCR Jurkat cells was determined by IL-2 secretion measured by electrochemiluminescence (MSD) in 24h co-culture assays of mTCR transduced Jurkat cells with neoantigen peptide and allele matched antigen presenting cell lines or CD3 + T cell depleted autologous patient PBMCs. Cytotoxicity of recombinant mTCR transduced PBMCs was assessed based on CD107a surface staining of effector cells and activated caspase-3 staining of target cells.
A375 target cells (ATCC) that were HLA-matched to the patient peptide of interest were harvested and plated in DMEM, high glucose, GlutaMAX Supplement, pyruvate (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning) at a density of 100,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The following day, the A375 cells were loaded with EPT length peptides (either containing the mutation or wild-type) by replacing the media in the wells with fresh AIM V Medium (GIBCO) containing peptide at a 2 μM final concentration. Patient PBMCs from the pre-treatment time point were enriched for CD3 + T cells using the Pan T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi). Isolated CD3 + T cells were transduced with neoantigen-specific TCRs and cocultured with target A375 cells at varying effector:target ratios for a period of 6 or 24h.
Targeted gene expression analysis on total RNA extracted from FFPE blocks was performed using the NanoString nCounter platform (NanoString Technologies). A custom code set consisting of 800 genes, including markers for immune cell populations, cytolytic markers, immune activation and suppression, and the tumor microenvironment, was used. For each sample, either 50ng or 100ng of total RNA was hybridized with the custom gene expression code set for 16h at 65°C according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Hybridized samples were run on the NanoString nCounter SPRINT Profiler instrument (NanoString Technologies). Raw data was normalized to the 30 housekeeping genes included in the custom code set using the nSolver software (version 3.0). Modified PanCancer IO360 gene signature scores were calculated and provided by NanoString Technologies. Additional gene signature scores were calculated in house using normalized gene expression.
To assess the APOE genotype from patients, whole exome sequencing data (aligned to hg19) was queried for allele frequencies using pysam (v0.15.2)( Li et al., 2009 47. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (37568) PubMed Google Scholar ) at genomic locations chr19:45411941 (site A) and chr19:45412079 (site B) as determined in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study ( Blair et al., 2005 10. Blair, C.K. ∙ Folsom, A.R. ∙ Knopman, D.S. ... APOE genotype and cognitive decline in a middle-aged cohort Neurology. 2005; 64 :268-276 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). APOE E4 genotype was assigned if site A and B were both homozygous for cytosine.
For each patient FFPE tumor block, histological and immunohistochemical analysis was done at Mosaic Laboratories (Lake Forest, CA). H&E analysis was performed according to Mosaic Laboratories’ optimized protocols and reviewed for cellular quality, morphology, and presence of tumor by an independent pathologist. Immunohistochemical analysis for PD-L1 (DAKO kit, MOS504-APD) was performed according to Mosaic Laboratories’ optimized protocols. Staining was evaluated using ImageScope software and standard pathology review. PD-L1 staining was evaluated using scoring criteria provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Immunohistochemistry for CD3 was performed on 5μm FFPE tumor sections. Slides were baked at 60°C overnight, dewaxed and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed using a microwave (MWT) with antigen retrieval buffer (citric acid based, pH 6.0, Vector Labs) heated to 90°C for 15min. After cooling to room temperature (RT), slides were washed with TBST/0.5% Tween and blocked for 10min with Akoya blocking buffer (Akoya Biosciences). Primary antibody CD3 (Biocare Medical, clone LN10, 1:100) was incubated at RT for 30min. Slides were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:1 in TBS for 30min (Vector Labs). CD3 was visualized with ImmPACT Vector Red chromogenic staining.
Manual multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining was performed on 5μm FFPE tumor sections using the TSA Plus Fluorescence kit (Akoya Biosciences). Slides were baked at 60°C overnight, dewaxed and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed using a microwave (MWT) with antigen retrieval buffer (citric acid based, pH 6.0, Vector Labs) heated to 90°C for 15min. After cooling to room temperature (RT), slides were washed with TBST/0.5% Tween and incubated with 3% H 2 O 2 for 15min. Next, slides were blocked with 2% BSA, 5% NHS in TBST for 1h. Primary antibody TCF7 (Cell Signal Technology, clone C6D9, 1:50) was incubated at RT for 1h. Slides were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:1 in TBS for 30min (Vector Labs). TCF7 was visualized with TSA Cy5 (1:50) for 10 min.
Multiplex staining was performed by repeating staining cycles with MWT heating between each step to remove the antibody complex. Successive antibodies include: CD8 (Biocare Medical, clone SP16, 1:100, TSA plus Cy3) and S100 (Biocare Medical, clone 15E2E2&4C4.9, 1:100, TSA Fluorescein) each incubated for 30min. Secondary HRP antibodies were diluted 1:1 with TBS and incubated for 30min (Vector Labs). Nuclei were stained with DAPI 1:3000 for 10min (Fisher Scientific), washed and mounted with Prolong gold (Fisher Scientific). Human tonsil FFPE tissues were used with and without primary antibodies to serve as positive and negative (autofluorescence) controls.
The multiplex slides were scanned with a Vectra 3.0 microscope system (Perkin Elmer). Whole slide scans were performed using the 10x objective lens. Up to ten individual fields were selected in the Phenochart program (Phenochart 1.0.9, Perkin Elmer) for higher resolution scanning at 20x (669x500 μm). Multispectral images were unmixed and analyzed using inForm software (inForm 2.4.2, Perkin Elmer) and analyzed with tissue component segmentation based on tumor cell staining: tumor = S100+ regions and stroma = S100- regions. Individual cells (defined by DAPI positive nuclei) were then phenotyped to characterize various cell populations. Density of cells in each ROI was calculated by combining the cell counts from all images and normalizing by the total area (cells/mm 2 ).
Anti-tumor activity was assessed for objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1. DOR is defined as the date of the first documented confirmed response to the date of the first documented PD or death. PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dosing to the date of first documented PD or death. OS is defined from the date of enrollment to death. Statistical efficacy analyses were performed separately for each indication for both the ITT set defined as receiving at least one dose of nivolumab and the safety set defined as receiving at least one dose of vaccine. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate PFS and OS. For PFS, patients who did not have PFS event on study or who were lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last tumor assessment. For OS, patients who were alive or who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last record on database.
All other analyses were performed in either the R language and environment for statistical computing (version 3.5.1) or GraphPad Prism (version 7.01). Likewise, all figures were created using an R script on the “ggplot2” package ( Wickham, 2016 77. Wickham, H. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis Springer, 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ) or GraphPad Prism. Unless otherwise specified, p values were derived from a two-tailed Student’s t test.
