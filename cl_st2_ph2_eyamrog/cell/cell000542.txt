Title: An adjuvant strategy enabled by modulation of the physical properties of microbial ligands expands antigen immunogenicity


Abstract: Summary

Activation of the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is key to generate lasting adaptive immunity. PRRs detect unique chemical patterns associated with invading microorganisms, but whether and how the physical properties of PRR ligands influence the development of the immune response remains unknown. Through the study of fungal mannans, we show that the physical form of PRR ligands dictates the immune response. Soluble mannans are immunosilent in the periphery but elicit a potent pro-inflammatory response in the draining lymph node (dLN). By modulating the physical form of mannans, we developed a formulation that targets both the periphery and the dLN. When combined with viral glycoprotein antigens, this mannan formulation broadens epitope recognition, elicits potent antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies, and confers protection against viral infections of the lung. Thus, the physical properties of microbial ligands determine the outcome of the immune response and can be harnessed for vaccine development.

Section: Introduction

The dialogue between the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system is critical for protection against infections, as well as the pathogenesis of autoimmune, allergic, and inflammatory diseases ( Banchereau and Steinman, 1998 4.

Tolerance, danger, and the extended family Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12 :991-1045 Crossref Scopus (4171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peripheral tissue infection and/or damage leads to the activation and migration of innate immune phagocytes to the draining lymph node (dLN), where they initiate an antigen-dependent adaptive immune response. Alternatively, innate stimuli or microbes with specific physical properties (e.g., diameter in the nanometer range) can directly drain to the dLN and activate the lymph node (LN)-resident innate and adaptive immune cells ( Bachmann and Jennings, 2010 3.

The dLN has been thoroughly scrutinized for its capacity to host adaptive immune responses, but recent reports indicate that the antigen-dependent adaptive immune response is preceded and supported by an antigen-independent LN innate response ( Acton et al., 2014 1.

The LN innate response allows antigen-independent LN expansion, establishment of a pro-inflammatory milieu, and the development of an effective adaptive immune response ( Acton and Reis e Sousa, 2016 2.

The lymph node at a glance – how spatial organization optimizes the immune response J. Cell Sci. 2020; 133 Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar ). It remains a mystery whether and how the LN innate response may differ when it is driven by the migration of phagocytes from the periphery, as opposed to when it is governed by the direct targeting of LN-resident innate immune cells.
Innate immune cells recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) ( Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002 30. Janeway, Jr., C.A. ∙ Medzhitov, R. Innate immune recognition Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20 :197-216 Crossref Scopus (6548) PubMed Google Scholar ) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) ( Brubaker et al., 2015 10. Brubaker, S.W. ∙ Bonham, K.S. ∙ Zanoni, I. ... Innate immune pattern recognition: a cell biological perspective Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33 :257-290 Crossref Scopus (1078) PubMed Google Scholar ). PRR activation is critical for triggering inflammation and for the ensuing development of adaptive immune responses. For this reason, targeting of PRRs has been harnessed for vaccine development ( O’Hagan et al., 2020 54. O’Hagan, D.T. ∙ Lodaya, R.N. ∙ Lofano, G. The continued advance of vaccine adjuvants – ‘we can work it out Semin. Immunol. 2020; 50 :101426 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among PRRs, the biology of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and their potential as vaccine adjuvant targets have been less investigated.
CLRs control innate and adaptive immune responses to fungal infection through recognition of cell wall polysaccharides ( Borriello et al., 2020 7. Borriello, F. ∙ Zanoni, I. ∙ Granucci, F. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of antifungal innate immunity at epithelial barriers: the role of C-type lectin receptors Eur. J. Immunol. 2020; 50 :317-325 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Brown et al., 2018 9. Brown, G.D. ∙ Willment, J.A. ∙ Whitehead, L. C-type lectins in immunity and homeostasis Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :374-389 Crossref Scopus (437) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CLRs Dectin-1 ( Clec7a ) and Dectin-2 ( Clec4n ) are activated by β-glucans and mannans, respectively. These fungal polysaccharides vary not only by chemical structure but also by physical form (e.g., size and solubility). Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 bind fungal polysaccharides in soluble, as well as insoluble forms, but only the latter induces efficient receptor clustering and activation ( Goodridge et al., 2011 21. Goodridge, H.S. ∙ Reyes, C.N. ∙ Becker, C.A. ... Activation of the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 upon formation of a ‘phagocytic synapse Nature. 2011; 472 :471-475 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2013 77. Zhu, L.L. ∙ Zhao, X.Q. ∙ Jiang, C. ...

Consequently, it is widely held that only particulate polysaccharides are immuno-stimulatory. In this study, we re-examined this paradigm and show that the quality of LN innate and adaptive immune responses can be tuned by modulating the physical properties of fungal ligands, providing a promising approach for adjuvant design and vaccine development.

Section: Results

We employed preparations of β-glucans and mannans isolated from Candida albicans that exhibit distinct physical forms, being insoluble (with a diameter of ∼500 nm) and soluble (with a diameter of ∼20 nm) ( Figure S1 A). Particulate β-glucans, but not soluble mannans, elicited cytokine production and expression of co-stimulatory molecules by phagocytes in vitro ( Figure S1 B). As expected, signaling by β-glucans required Dectin-1 ( Figure S1 C). In contrast to soluble mannans, immobilization of mannans onto microbeads resulted in Dectin-2- and FcRγ-dependent activation of phagocytes ( Figure S1 C, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and curdlan were used as controls). Accordingly, β-glucans elicited formation of skin abscesses and lesions upon in vivo intradermal injection, whereas mannans did not ( Figure 1 A). These results were confirmed by transcriptomic analysis of skin samples ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). Pathway analysis of the cluster of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upregulated by β-glucans showed enrichment for pro-inflammatory and type II interferon (IFN) pathways, consistent with the response elicited by C. albicans skin infection ( Figure S1 D) ( Santus et al., 2017 60. Santus, W. ∙ Barresi, S. ∙ Mingozzi, F. ... Skin infections are eliminated by cooperation of the fibrinolytic and innate immune systems Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 , eaan2725 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). While soluble mannans did not induce skin inflammation, these fungal ligands induced dLN expansion and lymphocyte accrual as early as 6 h post-injection (h.p.i.), which was sustained at 24 h.p.i. ( Figure 1 C; Figures S2 A–S2C) and dependent on circulating leukocyte recruitment ( Figure 1 D). β-glucans also elicited LN expansion but only at 24 h.p.i. ( Figure 1 C; Figures S2 A–S2C). Both fungal ligands increased the numbers of myeloid cells in the dLN ( Figures S2 D–S2G), with β-glucans preferentially increasing neutrophils, possibly reflecting drainage from the skin ( Figure S2 D). However, only mannans induced the activation of myeloid cells, as measured by increased CD86 expression ( Figure S2 H). Considering the fast response and the diameter compatible with lymphatic drainage, we reasoned that mannans might activate LN-intrinsic circuits that eventually lead to dLN expansion. In keeping with this hypothesis, mannans rapidly accumulated in the dLN of wild-type (WT) and Ccr7 −/− mice in which migration of immune cells from the periphery (i.e., skin) to the dLNs is abolished ( Figure 1 E) ( Ohl et al., 2004 55. Ohl, L. ∙ Mohaupt, M. ∙ Czeloth, N. ... CCR7 governs skin dendritic cell migration under inflammatory and steady-state conditions Immunity. 2004; 21 :279-288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (842) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, mannans induced dLN expansion even in Ccr7 −/− mice ( Figure 1 F) A transcriptomic analysis of dLNs showed a completely opposite profile compared with the skin, with mannans eliciting an earlier and more pronounced response than β-glucans ( Figure 1 G; Table S2 ). Pathway analysis showed that mannans upregulated type I and II IFN pathways ( Figures 1 H and 1I).
The presence of type II IFN (IFNγ)-producing cells in mannan-treated dLN was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure S2 I). The majority of IFNγ-producing cells were CD8 + T and NK cells ( Figure S2 J), with NK cells expressing IFNγ at higher levels ( Figure S2 K). When NK cells were depleted, expression of Ifng was impaired ( Figure S2 L). Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) produce cytokines that induce NK cell activation and IFNγ production ( Cancel et al., 2019 11. Cancel, J.C. ∙ Crozat, K. ∙ Dalod, M. ... Are conventional Type 1 dendritic cells critical for protective antitumor immunity and how? Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :9 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may therefore contribute to the response induced by mannans. Nevertheless, Batf3 −/− mice that lack cDC1s showed no impairment of mannan-elicited Ifng expression ( Figure S2 M). Notably, NK cell depletion only partially affected LN expansion and cell accrual ( Figure S2 N). In keeping with this, IFNγ blockade only partially reduced the mannan-induced expansion of LN ( Figure 1 J). We, therefore, tested whether the absence of both IFNγ and type I IFN signaling impacted the LN innate response. Simultaneous blockade of both IFN types prevented mannan-elicited LN expansion and the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) ( Figure 1 J). This mechanism was not restricted to mannans, since LN expansion and the induction of ISGs elicited by Lipo-CpG, a well characterized LN-targeted Toll-like receptor (TLR)9 ligand ( Liu et al., 2014 39. Liu, H. ∙ Moynihan, K.D. ∙ Zheng, Y. ... Structure-based programming of lymph-node targeting in molecular vaccines Nature. 2014; 507 :519-522 Crossref Scopus (748) PubMed Google Scholar ), were also impaired in Ifnar −/− Ifngr −/− mice ( Figure 1 K). To further establish whether these differences were due to the distinct physical forms of fungal polysaccharides, we evaluated the response to whole glucan particles (WGP) in dispersible (D) or soluble (S) forms, which have been characterized as Dectin-1 agonists and antagonists, respectively ( Goodridge et al., 2011 21. Goodridge, H.S. ∙ Reyes, C.N. ∙ Becker, C.A. ... Activation of the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 upon formation of a ‘phagocytic synapse Nature. 2011; 472 :471-475 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the pattern observed in mannans, WGP-S did not induce skin inflammation ( Figure S3 A) but elicited LN expansion and ISG expression ( Figure S3 B). Altogether, these results support a model in which the physical form of PAMPs drives dLN expansion and ISG induction.
We found that Dectin-2, the major receptor for mannans ( Borriello et al., 2020 7. Borriello, F. ∙ Zanoni, I. ∙ Granucci, F.

An integrated model of the recognition of Candida albicans by the innate immune system Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6 :67-78 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ) and its co-receptor FcRγ were required for mannan-elicited LN expansion and ISG induction ( Figure 2 A). We employed fluorescently labeled mannans and found that mannan-laden cells were CD45 + cells ( Figure 2 B). Imaging cytometry analysis confirmed that these cells internalized mannans ( Figure 2 C), and confocal microscopy analysis showed colocalization of phospho-Syk and mannans ( Figure 2 D), indicative of Dectin-2 and FcRγ-mediated activation. Accordingly, mannan-laden cells showed the highest levels of expression of CD86 in an FcRγ-dependent manner ( Figure 2 E). We found that more than 50% of mannan-laden cells were Ly6G − (CD11b + Ly6C + ) − CD11c + cells, while less abundant cell subsets were neutrophils (CD11b + Ly6G + ) and monocytes (-derived) cells (MoCs, Ly6G − CD11b + Ly6C + ) ( Figure 2 F). The depletion of CD11c + cells, but not the inhibition of monocyte egress from the bone marrow or the depletion of neutrophils, abolished the mannan-elicited LN innate response ( Figure 2 G–2I). CD11c + cells can be further distinguished based on the expression of CD11b ( Figure 2 F). Since Dectin-2 is critical for mannan-elicited LN innate response, we assessed its expression on CD11b − CD11c + and CD11b + CD11c + cells at steady state. Dectin-2 was expressed mainly by CD11b + CD11c + cells ( Figure 2 J). The majority of CD11b + CD11c + Dectin-2 + cells expressed the subcapsular and medullary sinus macrophage marker CD169 ( Figure 2 K). Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed the colocalization of CD169 and Dectin-2 on cells lining the LN subcapsular sinus ( Figure 2 L). Furthermore, DT-mediated depletion of CD169 + cells in CD169-DTR mice phenocopied the results obtained with CD11c-DTR mice and completely abolished mannan-elicited LN expansion and ISG induction ( Figure 2 M). These results are consistent with a role for CD169 + sinus macrophages as sentinels of lymph-borne materials ( Moran et al., 2019 50. Moran, I. ∙ Grootveld, A.K. ∙ Nguyen, A. ... Subcapsular sinus macrophages: the seat of innate and adaptive memory in murine lymph nodes Trends Immunol. 2019; 40 :35-48 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ).
CARD9 is the major signaling adaptor of Dectins ( Brubaker et al., 2015 10. Brubaker, S.W. ∙ Bonham, K.S. ∙ Zanoni, I. ... Innate immune pattern recognition: a cell biological perspective Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33 :257-290 Crossref Scopus (1078) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the mannan-elicited LN expansion was comparable between WT and Card9 −/− mice ( Figure 3 A). In keeping with this, the induction of ISGs was largely maintained in Card9 −/− mice ( Figure 3 A). In particular, type I IFN-dependent genes were unchanged in Card9 −/− compared with WT mice, while type II IFN-dependent ISGs, although significantly decreased compared with WT mice, were still partially induced ( Figure 3 A). Next, we performed a targeted transcriptomic analysis of mannan-laden CD11b + CD11c + cells isolated from WT, Fcer1g −/− , and Card9 −/− mice. While several genes were differentially expressed between WT (or Card9 −/− ) and Fcer1g −/− mice, cells isolated from WT and Card9 −/− mice exhibited strikingly similar transcriptomes ( Figure 3 B; Tables S3–S7 ). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that DEGs between cells isolated from WT and Fcer1g −/− mice were represented in TNF/NF-κB, type I and II IFN pathways ( Figure S4 ). Downstream of Dectin-2, Syk activates the kinase NIK, which in turn leads to CARD9-independent activation of the non-canonical NF-κB transcription factor RelB ( Gringhuis et al., 2009 24. Gringhuis, S.I. ∙ den Dunnen, J. ∙ Litjens, M. ... Dectin-1 directs T helper cell differentiation by controlling noncanonical NF-κB activation through Raf-1 and Syk Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10 :203-213 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2018 76. Xu, X. ∙ Xu, J.F. ∙ Zheng, G. ... CARD9(S12N) facilitates the production of IL-5 by alveolar macrophages for the induction of type 2 immune responses Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :547-560 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). We, therefore, generated mice in which RelB was conditionally deleted in the CD11c + compartment ( Cd11c cre Relb fl/fl ). Mannan-induced LN expansion and expression of both type I and type II IFN-dependent ISGs were significantly reduced compared with control ( Relb fl/fl ) mice ( Figure 3 C). Similar results were obtained when Lipo-CpG was employed ( Figure 3 D). These results support a model in which RelB regulates optimal IFN-dependent ISG expression elicited by LN-targeted stimuli to sustain LN expansion.
We reasoned that lymphocyte accrual and IFN signatures induced by mannan may favor the encounter of T cells with their cognate antigen and its efficient presentation by the innate immune compartment, thereby improving the adaptive immune response. We employed a model of adoptive transfer of CFSE-labeled, ovalbumin (OVA)-specific OT-I CD8 + and OT-II CD4 + T cells to assess the modulation of T cell proliferation ( Figures 4 A–4H). Combining mannans with OVA resulted in a strong increase in the numbers of OT-I and OT-II cells in the dLN compared with the mice injected with saline or OVA alone ( Figures 4 A and 4E). This increase was likely due to the improved T cell recruitment to the dLN and more efficient antigen presentation/co-stimulation by LN-resident innate immune cells. Indeed, we detected a lower percentage of non-proliferating T cells, as well as a higher percentage of T cells undergoing 6 or 7 divisions in mice treated with OVA and mannans compared with OVA alone ( Figures 4 B and 4F). Of note, the effect of mannans on T cell proliferation was abrogated in Fcer1g −/− mice, while it was only attenuated in Card9 −/− mice ( Figures 4 C, 4D, 4G, and 4H). These results show that pathways required for the mannan-elicited LN innate response are also critical for the adjuvant activity of mannans on antigen-specific adaptive immune responses.
To further modulate the physical properties of mannans, we exploited the presence of phosphate groups of mannans to promote adsorption onto aluminum hydroxide (hereafter alum), as shown for other molecules ( Morefield et al., 2005 51. Morefield, G.L. ∙ Jiang, D. ∙ Romero-Mendez, I.Z. ... Effect of phosphorylation of ovalbumin on adsorption by aluminum-containing adjuvants and elution upon exposure to interstitial fluid Vaccine. 2005; 23 :1502-1506 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moyer et al., 2020 52. Moyer, T.J. ∙ Kato, Y. ∙ Abraham, W. ... Engineered immunogen binding to alum adjuvant enhances humoral immunity Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :430-440 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). By 1 H-NMR, we found that alum adsorbed ∼40% of mannans, with the remainder staying soluble ( Figure S5 A). We also quantified alum-bound mannans at approximately twice its mass in the formulation used in these experiments.
In vitro experiments showed that the formulation of mannans with alum, but not alum or mannans alone, induced cytokine production in a Dectin-2- and CARD9-dependent manner ( Figures S5 B and S5C), while the expression of co-stimulatory molecules was Dectin-2-dependent but CARD9-independent ( Figures S5 D and S5E). Finally, mannans formulated or not with alum, but not alum alone, induced ISG expression in a Dectin-2-dependent but CARD9-independent manner, except for CXCL1 that was significantly upregulated only in response to mannans formulated with alum in WT cells ( Figure S5 F–S5I).
When injected into mice, mannans formulated with alum not only elicited skin inflammation ( Figure 5 A) but also drained to the LN in a CCR7-independent manner ( Figure 5 B). Mannans formulated with alum induced over time a higher LN expansion compared with alum, mannans, or β-glucans ( Figure 5 C). Moreover, mannans alone or in combination with alum elicited comparable ISG expression in the dLN ( Figure 5 D). As expected, β-glucans induced LN expansion but were largely excluded from the LN and did not induce expression of ISG ( Figures 5 B–5D). LN expansion induced by mannans formulated with alum, but not β-glucans, was impaired in Ifnar −/− mice treated with an anti-IFNγ blocking antibody ( Figure 5 E). Similar results were obtained when IFN production was transiently blocked by treating WT mice with anti-IFNAR and anti-IFNγ blocking antibodies ( Figure 5 F). Overall, these results are compatible with a model in which the particulate fraction (mannans adsorbed onto alum) promotes skin inflammation, while the soluble fraction (unbound mannans) drains to the LN and induces the ISG expression. Side by side injections of mice with either particulate or soluble fractions of mannans formulated with alum validated this model ( Figure 5 G, H). Finally, we assessed whether the LN innate response induced by mannans formulated with alum exploits the same cellular and molecular mechanisms of mannans or whether the immunomodulatory functions of alum ( Eisenbarth et al., 2008 17. Eisenbarth, S.C. ∙ Colegio, O.R. ∙ O’Connor, W. ... Crucial role for the Nalp3 inflammasome in the immunostimulatory properties of aluminium adjuvants Nature. 2008; 453 :1122-1126 Crossref Scopus (1272) PubMed Google Scholar ) completely rewired these requirements. We found that LN expansion and ISG induction were impaired in Clec4n −/− and Fcer1g −/− mice ( Figure 5 I). In addition, Ifng expression in the dLN was reduced when NK cells were depleted ( Figure 5 J) and preserved in Batf3 −/− mice lacking cDC1 ( Figure 5 K). Overall, formulation with alum endows mannans with enhanced immunological functions that can be predicted based on their physical properties (i.e., particulate versus soluble) and reflects triggering of mannan-dependent Dectin-2-activated pathways.
To investigate adjuvant activities of mannans in an immunization model of translational relevance, we used the pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer (hereafter Spike) ( Corbett et al., 2020 14.

We immunized mice with Spike alone or with Spike admixed with alum, β-glucans, or mannans that are either formulated or not with alum, with a prime-boost schedule. Mannans formulated with alum induced the highest levels of anti-Spike or anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Type-1 immunity has been associated with reduced risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease upon viral infection ( Graham, 2020 22. Graham, B.S. Rapid COVID-19 vaccine development Science. 2020; 368 :945-946 Crossref Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ), and mannans formulated with alum promoted anti-Spike type-1 immunity by inducing anti-Spike IgG2c and antigen-specific T cells skewed toward IFNγ production ( Figures 6 A–6C). Elevated levels of anti-Spike IgG1 and IgG2c were maintained for up to 98 days post immunization ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Next, we performed a surrogate virus neutralization test and an actual SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test and found that mice immunized with Spike and mannans formulated with alum showed the highest degree of neutralization ( Figures 6 D and 6E). We also assessed whether there were spatial and temporal constraints to the adjuvant effect of mannans formulated with alum. Mice were injected with Spike and mannans formulated with alum at the same site, or with Spike formulated with alum at one injection site and with mannans at an adjacent site, either on the same day or on the next day. An enhanced antibody response was observed only when Spike was admixed with mannans formulated with alum ( Figures 6 F and 6G). In contrast to B cell responses, IFNγ production by antigen-specific T cells was observed in mice immunized with alum and mannans, regardless of when and where mannans were injected ( Figure 6 H).
B and T cell responses induced by mannans formulated with alum were abrogated in Clec4n −/− mice ( Figures S6 C and S6D) but only partially impaired in Card9 −/− mice ( Figures S6 E and S6F). Immunization of Cd11c cre Relb fl/fl or Ifnar −/− Ifngr −/− mice, as well as of WT mice in which IFN signaling was transiently abrogated during the immunization phase by administration of anti-IFNAR and anti-IFNγ antibodies, all showed impairment in the anti-Spike IgG response ( Figures S6 G–S6I). Finally, we found that cDC1s were also required, as assessed by impaired IgG production in Batf3 −/− mice ( Figure S6 J).
To determine the Spike epitopes targeted by antibodies elicited by the different adjuvant formulations tested above, we performed a VirScan analysis ( Shrock et al., 2020 63. Shrock, E. ∙ Fujimura, E. ∙ Kula, T. ... Viral epitope profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals cross-reactivity and correlates of severity Science. 2020; 370 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2015a 74. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). All formulations induced antibodies against the heptad repeat 2 region, but only mannans formulated with alum induced antibodies directed toward the fusion peptide and RBD ( Figure 6 I). This epitope-targeting profile was comparable for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike proteins. Notably, although fewer epitopes were recognized, the MERS Spike was also detected by antibodies elicited in mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and mannans formulated with alum ( Figure 6 I). Altogether, our results show that mannan formulations enhance anti-Spike antibody levels and promote anti-Spike type 1 immunity, and that mannans formulated with alum are particularly effective at inducing anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies with broad epitope specificity.
Next, we benchmarked mannans formulated with alum against adjuvants that are part of FDA-approved vaccines: squalene-based oil-in-water nano-emulsions (AS03-like AddaS03 or MF59-like AddaVax) and the AS04-like formulation prepared by a simple admixture of alum and PHAD, a synthetic structural analog of the monophosphoryl lipid A (alum/PHAD).
Immunization of mice with Spike and mannans formulated with alum, AddaS03, or alum/PHAD elicited comparable levels of anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgG antibodies ( Figure 7 A). Increased anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies correlated with increased neutralization capacity compared with alum alone ( Figures S7 A and S7B). When mice were infected with the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10 strain ( Leist et al., 2020 36. Leist, S.R. ∙ Dinnon, 3rd, K.H. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... A mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 induces acute lung injury and mortality in standard laboratory mice Cell. 2020; 183 :1070-1085 e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found markedly reduced viral lung titers in mice immunized with mannans formulated with alum, AddaS03, or alum/PHAD compared with saline-treated or alum-immunized mice ( Figure 7 B).
The enhanced magnitude and breadth of the antigen-specific antibody response elicited by mannans formulated with alum might be relevant for additional viral glycoproteins of high antigenic variability, such as influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA). IAV is characterized by many strains within multiple serotypes, generating high subtypic diversity ( Sangesland and Lingwood, 2021 59. Sangesland, M. ∙ Lingwood, D. Antibody focusing to conserved sites of vulnerability: the immunological pathways for ‘universal’ influenza vaccines Vaccines (Basel). 2021; 9 :125 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reasoned that the mannan formulation might not only promote a robust antibody response against target antigens but also heterosubtypic immunity upon influenza vaccine immunization. We employed the clinically relevant recombinant HA (rHA) vaccine Flublok, and immunized mice with Flublok alone or Flublok formulated with alum, mannans formulated with alum, Addavax, or alum/PHAD. Anti-rHA antibodies were significantly increased in mice immunized with rHA and mannans formulated with alum, AddaVax, or alum/PHAD ( Figure 7 C). We then challenged the mice intranasally with the IAV strain A/PR/8/1934, whose HA is not part of the Flublok vaccine, and found that only mice previously immunized with Flublok and mannans formulated with alum were significantly protected. These results correlated with high IgG levels against recombinant HA derived from A/PR/8/1934 (rPR8) in mice immunized with Flublok and mannans formulated with alum, but not the other adjuvant formulations ( Figures 7 D–7F and S7 D).
Overall, these data show that the mannans formulated with alum enhance both magnitude and breadth of the antibody response against multiple viral glycoproteins in clinically relevant immunization models.

Section: Discussion

The activation of innate immune cells by PRR ligands is a critical step to initiate an adaptive immune response ( Banchereau and Steinman, 1998 4. Banchereau, J. ∙ Steinman, R.M. Dendritic cells and the control of immunity Nature. 1998; 392 :245-252 Crossref Scopus (12601) PubMed Google Scholar ; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004 28. Iwasaki, A. ∙ Medzhitov, R. Toll-like receptor control of the adaptive immune responses Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5 :987-995 Crossref Scopus (3499) PubMed Google Scholar ; Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002 30. Janeway, Jr., C.A. ∙ Medzhitov, R. Innate immune recognition Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20 :197-216 Crossref Scopus (6548) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matzinger, 1994 46. Matzinger, P. Tolerance, danger, and the extended family Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12 :991-1045 Crossref Scopus (4171) PubMed Google Scholar ). The study of cellular and molecular events triggered by PRRs led to the identification of signaling organelles, metabolic pathways, and gene expression profiles that shape the innate immune response ( Brubaker et al., 2015 10. Brubaker, S.W. ∙ Bonham, K.S. ∙ Zanoni, I. ... Innate immune pattern recognition: a cell biological perspective Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33 :257-290 Crossref Scopus (1078) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, cell-intrinsic features of PRR activation and signaling alone do not explain the complexity of the in vivo inflammatory response elicited by innate stimuli. Indeed, their localization at cellular and organismal levels plays a key role in determining the activation status of innate immune cells ( Evavold and Kagan, 2019 18. Evavold, C.L. ∙ Kagan, J.C. Inflammasomes: threat-assessment organelles of the innate immune system Immunity. 2019; 51 :609-624 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The study of CLRs, and specifically of Dectin-1 and -2, is of particular interest since only the particulate form of their ligands induces efficient receptor clustering and activation ( Goodridge et al., 2011 21. Goodridge, H.S. ∙ Reyes, C.N. ∙ Becker, C.A. ... Activation of the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 upon formation of a ‘phagocytic synapse Nature. 2011; 472 :471-475 Crossref Scopus (654) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2013 77.

In our study, we show that soluble mannans, while largely inactive in vitro and in vivo at the injection site, traffic to the LN due to their size and elicit a potent innate response, characterized by LN expansion and expression of type I and II IFN transcriptional programs. Remarkably, the responses that we observed bypass the need for dendritic cell migration from the periphery to the dLN, and soluble mannans directly target CD169 + sinus macrophages. We further modulated the physical properties of mannans by adsorbing them onto alum to obtain formulations in which mannans are present in both soluble and particulate forms. We show that this formulation results in enhanced immunological properties, such as full activation of innate immune cells in vitro and simultaneous targeting of the periphery and the LN. When tested as an adjuvant system formulated with viral glycoprotein antigens (IAV HA or SARS-CoV-2 Spike), mannans enabled induction of neutralizing antibodies with broad epitope specificity. Mannans formulated with alum protect against a SARS-CoV-2 MA10 challenge to the same extent as adjuvants that resemble those included in licensed vaccines. Immunization of mice with rHA-based Flublok vaccine formulated with alum and mannans elicited heterosubtypic immunity. Overall, our work sheds light on the molecular pathways activated by mannan formulations that trigger LN innate and adaptive responses and result in antibody responses against viral glycoproteins of enhanced magnitude and breadth.
A key aspect of our work is the requirement for both type I and II IFNs to sustain mannan-induced lymphocyte accrual and LN expansion. Also, IFNs are necessary to potentiate the induction of antigen-specific antibodies. IFNs act on both myeloid cells and LN stromal cells where they modulate a range of functions, including chemokine expression and vascular permeability ( Barrat et al., 2019 5. Barrat, F.J. ∙ Crow, M.K. ∙ Ivashkiv, L.B. Interferon target-gene expression and epigenomic signatures in health and disease Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :1574-1583 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ivashkiv, 2018 27. Ivashkiv, L.B. IFNγ: signalling, epigenetics and roles in immunity, metabolism, disease and cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :545-558 Crossref Scopus (730) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, our results raise the possibility that mannan-elicited IFN signatures affect LN-resident myeloid and stromal compartments, eventually leading to potentiated adaptive immune responses. Our data on the augmented production and epitope specificity of the anti-Spike antibody and data on the induction of cross-reactive anti-A/PR/8/1934 HA-antibodies suggest that the IFN signature driven by mannans formulated with alum broadens epitope recognition and potentiates protection against viruses. Nevertheless, in the future, it will be important to assess a possible “innate training” effect promoted by a more potent IFN response that may yield to cross-protective innate immunity.
Mannans formulated with alum acquire remarkable new immunological properties. Although we cannot exclude synergy between alum and mannans, our results are more readily explained by the concurrent presence in the formulation of mannans unbound to alum and alum-adsorbed mannans. The former is responsible for ISG expression in the dLN, while the latter mediates skin inflammation. Evaluation of mannans formulated with alum in our immunization model with SARS-CoV-2 Spike supports this model. Direct synergy between alum and mannan inflammatory activity was excluded when alum and mannans were injected separately but in close physical proximity, an approach that led to a loss of the capacity of these adjuvants to enhance anti-Spike IgG. Such loss did not apply to T cell-mediated responses, which were boosted by the presence of mannans, independently of their coformulation with alum. Analysis of soluble mannans that are either formulated or not with alum and admixed to Spike also showed that both formulations induce humoral and cellular type 1 immunity. Early induction of type I and II IFN signatures in the dLN is therefore sufficient to explain polarization of the adaptive immune response. Transient disruption of type I/II IFN signaling by administration of blocking antibodies significantly decreased levels of anti-Spike IgG, suggesting that early IFN signatures in the dLN translate into long-term potentiation of the immune response.
A remarkable property of the formulation of mannans and alum is its ability to induce neutralizing anti-Spike antibodies with broad epitope specificity. These antibodies cross-react with the SARS-CoV Spike and, to a lesser extent, the MERS Spike. The epitope specificity profile observed in mice immunized with alum and mannans is comparable to that observed in COVID-19 patients, highlighting the translational relevance of our results ( Shrock et al., 2020 63. Shrock, E. ∙ Fujimura, E. ∙ Kula, T. ... Viral epitope profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals cross-reactivity and correlates of severity Science. 2020; 370 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ). Production of these antibodies has the same molecular and cellular requirements as the LN innate reaction induced by mannans formulated with alum, with the sole exception of cDC1 that play an important role in driving the IgG response but not the LN innate response. Neutralizing antibodies are important for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models ( Cao et al., 2020 12. Cao, Y. ∙ Su, B. ∙ Guo, X. ...

Accordingly, mice immunized with Spike and mannans formulated with alum show undetectable lung viral titers after infection with SARS-CoV-2 MA10, similar to mice immunized with clinically relevant adjuvant formulations. We then employed a model of influenza vaccination, using the clinically relevant Flublok vaccine. While all adjuvants tested enhanced the antibody response to Flublok, only mannans formulated with alum induced heterosubtypic immunity that was paralleled by detection of antibodies that cross-react against HA of A/PR/8/1934. It will be important in the future to clarify how the formulation of mannans and alum modulates germinal center dynamics and B cell repertoire selection. From a translational perspective, the broadening of epitope specificity suggests that mannans formulated with alum in combination with appropriate antigens might be a promising candidate for the development of vaccines that target multiple coronavirus or influenza A strains.
Overall, our study provides mechanistic and translational insights into how modulation of the physical form of mannans enables Dectin-2 targeting to enhance vaccine immunogenicity and protection, thereby illuminating the relationship between the physical form of innate stimuli and LN innate and adaptive immune responses.
Our study provides a detailed mechanistic analysis of mannan-induced LN innate response at the molecular and cellular level. We demonstrated that mannans alone or mannans admixed with alum require Dectin-2-expressing, CD169 + sinus macrophages, but not cDC1s, neutrophils, or monocytes for LN expansion, while cDC1s are required to potentiate antibody production. It remains to be elucidated whether other immune cells, such as cDC2, may be involved in either the LN innate or adaptive response. Also, it will be important to unravel the possible relationship between NK cells and DCs. Another unexpected finding is the only partial requirement of CARD9, the key signaling adaptor downstream of Dectins ( Borriello et al., 2020 7. Borriello, F. ∙ Zanoni, I. ∙ Granucci, F. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of antifungal innate immunity at epithelial barriers: the role of C-type lectin receptors Eur. J. Immunol. 2020; 50 :317-325 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Brubaker et al., 2015 10. Brubaker, S.W. ∙ Bonham, K.S. ∙ Zanoni, I. ... Innate immune pattern recognition: a cell biological perspective Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33 :257-290 Crossref Scopus (1078) PubMed Google Scholar ). CARD9-independent pathways downstream of Dectins have also been described, including NIK-dependent activation of the non-canonical NFκB subunits p52 and RelB ( Gringhuis et al., 2009 24. Gringhuis, S.I. ∙ den Dunnen, J. ∙ Litjens, M. ... Dectin-1 directs T helper cell differentiation by controlling noncanonical NF-κB activation through Raf-1 and Syk Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10 :203-213 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2018 76. Xu, X. ∙ Xu, J.F. ∙ Zheng, G. ... CARD9(S12N) facilitates the production of IL-5 by alveolar macrophages for the induction of type 2 immune responses Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :547-560 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice that lack NIK, p52, or RelB have profound defects in secondary lymphoid organ development ( Sun, 2017 66. Sun, S.C. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway in immunity and inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :545-558 Crossref Scopus (1204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results show that RelB activation in CD11c-expressing cells regulates mannan-induced LN expansion and expression of type I IFN-dependent ISGs and cooperates with CARD9 in modulating the expression of type II IFN-dependent ISGs. Although the role of RelB in modulating IFN responses and ISG expression is ambiguous ( Le Bon et al., 2006 34. Le Bon, A. ∙ Montoya, M. ∙ Edwards, M.J. ... A role for the transcription factor RelB in IFN-alpha production and in IFN-alpha-stimulated cross-priming Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36 :2085-2093 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saha et al., 2020 57. Saha, I. ∙ Jaiswal, H. ∙ Mishra, R. ... RelB suppresses type I interferon signaling in dendritic cells Cell. Immunol. 2020; 349 :104043 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), and more studies will be required to decipher its role upon mannan encounter, our findings create an intriguing parallelism between LN development and the innate response, setting the stage for RelB as a central regulator of the biology of secondary lymphoid organs.

The formulation of alum and mannans (AH/mann) was obtained by admixture of alum (100 μg/10 μl), mannans (500 μg/25 μl) and saline (15 μl). When formulated with an antigen (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer or Flublok) the volume of saline was reduced accordingly in order to keep the total volume constant. This formulation is further described in the NIH/NIAID Vaccine Adjuvant Compendium ( https://vac.niaid.nih.gov ).
For mannan isolation, C. albicans was inoculated into 15 l of YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) and grown for 20 hours at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 minutes. This resulted in a 100 g pellet from 15 l of media. We used a standard protocol for isolation and NMR characterization of the mannan ( Kruppa et al., 2011 33. Kruppa, M. ∙ Greene, R.R. ∙ Noss, I. ... C. albicans increases cell wall mannoprotein, but not mannan, in response to blood, serum and cultivation at physiological temperature Glycobiology. 2011; 21 :1173-1180 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lowman et al., 2011 41. Lowman, D.W. ∙ Ensley, H.E. ∙ Greene, R.R. ... Mannan structural complexity is decreased when Candida albicans is cultivated in blood or serum at physiological temperature Carbohydr. Res. 2011; 346 :2752-2759 PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the cell pellets were suspended in 200 ml of acetone to delipidate the cells for 20 minutes prior to centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 minutes, removal of acetone and drying of the pellet for an hour. Dried pellets were broken up and transferred to a tissue homogenizer. An equivalent volume of acid-washed glass beads was added and 200 ml of dH 2 O was added to the mixture. The cells were subjected to bead beating for three 30 second pulses before the entire mixture was transferred to a 1 l flask. The material was autoclaved for 2 hours, allowed to cool and then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 5000 g . The supernatant was retained and the cell pellet discarded. Pronase (500 mg in 20 ml dH 2 O), which had been filter sterilized and heat treated for 20 minutes at 65°C (to remove any glycosidic activity) was added to the supernatant along with sodium azide to a concentration of 1 mM. The mixture was then incubated overnight (20 hours) at 37°C to allow for degradation of any proteins in the solution. Mannans were extracted by addition of an equal volume of Fehling’s solution to the protease treated mannan solution and allowed to mix for one hour at room temperature. After mixing the solution was allowed to stand for 20 minutes to facilitate mannan precipitation. The supernatant was decanted and the precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of 3M HCl, to enable release of copper from the reducing ends of the mannans. To the dissolved mannan solution 500 ml of an 8:1 mixture of methanol:acetic acid was added, and the mixture stirred to allow the mannan to precipitate overnight. After the material had settled, the supernatant was decanted, washed again with 500 ml of methanol, allowing six hours for the mannans to settle. The supernatant was decanted and the remaining precipitate was dissolved in 200 ml dH 2 O. The mannans were dialyzed against a 200-fold change of dH 2 O over 48 hours using a 2000 MW cutoff membrane to remove residual acid, methanol and other compounds from the extraction process. The dialysate was then subjected to lyophilization and stored at -20°C until needed. A small sample (10 mg) of the material was subjected to NMR to confirm for the purity of the N-linked mannans ( Lowman et al., 2011 41. Lowman, D.W. ∙ Ensley, H.E. ∙ Greene, R.R. ... Mannan structural complexity is decreased when Candida albicans is cultivated in blood or serum at physiological temperature Carbohydr. Res. 2011; 346 :2752-2759 PubMed Google Scholar ) and for assessment of molecular weight ( Kruppa et al., 2011 33. Kruppa, M. ∙ Greene, R.R. ∙ Noss, I. ... C. albicans increases cell wall mannoprotein, but not mannan, in response to blood, serum and cultivation at physiological temperature Glycobiology. 2011; 21 :1173-1180 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to in vitro or in vivo use the mannan is depyrogenated to remove any residual endotoxin and filter sterilized.
Mannan (100 mg) was dissolved in 6 ml of water, followed by addition of 1,3-diaminopropane (0.6 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 hour. Sodium cyanoborohydride (300 mg) was added and the pH value of the reaction mixture was adjusted to ∼4.8 by slowly adding acetic acid (∼1.1 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 hours, then dialyzed with a 2000 MWCO RC membrane against ultrapure water (1000 ml x 4). The retentate was harvested and lyophilized to yield the DAP attached mannan. The recovery was 88.5 mg, ∼88%. The mannan-DAP was characterized by 1 H-NMR to confirm the identity of the compound.
For conjugation with Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Ester (Succinimidyl Ester), ∼15 mg of mannan-DAP were resuspended in 1 ml of sodium borate conjugation buffer (100 mM, pH 8.5) and allowed to solvate for at least 24 hours. Then, 1 mg of Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Ester resuspended in 35 μl of DMSO was added to the solution and incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature with gentle agitation. The reaction mixture was dialyzed with a 6000-8000 MWCO RC membrane against saline (1000 ml x 4) and the retentate was filter sterilized.
For conjugation with carboxyl latex beads 3 μm, mannan-DAP was resuspended at a concentration of 10 mg/1 ml of BupH MES conjugation buffer pH 4.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and allowed to solvate for at least 24 hours. 1 ml of mannan-DAP was added to 50 x 10 6 beads and then mixed with 4 mg/1 ml of EDC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) resuspended in pure water. The reaction mixture was incubated for 4 hours in the dark at room temperature with gentle agitation. Then, the beads were washed twice (4000 g for 10 minutes) with saline and resuspended in saline at a concentration of 10 8 beads/ml.
β-glucan particles were isolated from Candida albicans SC5314 as previously described by our laboratory ( Lowman et al., 2014 42. Lowman, D.W. ∙ Greene, R.R. ∙ Bearden, D.W. ... Novel structural features in Candida albicans hyphal glucan provide a basis for differential innate immune recognition of hyphae versus yeast J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :3432-3443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, glucan was isolated from C.albicans using a base/acid extraction approach with provides water insoluble glucan particles that are > 95% pure. The structure and purity of the glucan was determined by 1 H-NMR in DMSO-d 6 ( Lowman et al., 2014 42. Lowman, D.W. ∙ Greene, R.R. ∙ Bearden, D.W. ... Novel structural features in Candida albicans hyphal glucan provide a basis for differential innate immune recognition of hyphae versus yeast J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :3432-3443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to in vitro or in vivo use the β-glucan particles are depyrogenated and sterilized.
β-glucan particles (20 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in 4 ml vial after one hour of stirring. 1,3-Diaminopropane (100 μL) was added and stirred at ambient temperature for 3 hours. Sodium cyanoborohydride (100 mg) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 48 hours, followed by addition of sodium borohydride (50 mg) and stirring for 24 hours. Acetic acid (200 μl) was added dropwise at 0°C to quench the reaction and the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 3 hours. The β-glucan particles were harvested and washed five times in water by centrifugation (862 g ). The recovery was >95%. The glucan-DAP was characterized by 1 H-NMR to confirm the derivatized glucan was still intact. The glucan-DAP was lyophilized to dryness and stored at -20°C in the dark in a desiccator until needed.
For conjugation with Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Ester (Succinimidyl Ester), 20 mg of glucan-DAP were suspended in 1 ml of sodium borate conjugation buffer (100 mM, pH 8.5) and allowed to hydrate for at least 24 hours at 4°C. 1 mg of Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Ester resuspended in 35 μl of DMSO was then added to the solution which was incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature with gentle agitation. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, washed five times in water with centrifugation (862 g ) and the 488 labeled glucan particles were harvested.
Supernatants were harvested from the alum/mannans mixture and were lyophilized. Lyophilized supernatants and a standard mannan sample (4.0 mg) that was not mixed with AH were respectively dissolved in 500 μl of deuterium oxide (99.9% D) with 0.01% (W/V) internal standard TMSP-2,2,3,3-D 4 (98.0% D). 1 H-NMR data were collected on a 400MHz Bruker Avance Ultra Shield NMR spectrometer at 295 K with the same acquisition parameters for all the samples. NMR spectra were processed using TOPSPIN 2.1 running on the Avance 400MHz NMR. The ring proton resonances (3.25 - 4.50 ppm) were integrated referencing to the integral of internal standard (-0.02 - 0.02 ppm) calibrated as 1.0. Based on the ratio between the mass of standard mannan (4.0 mg) and its ring proton integral (39.12), the mass of mannan in the supernatant was calculated using the detected ring proton integral multiplied by 4.0/39.2. Thus, the amount of mannan absorbed by the AH was determined by difference between the mass of total mannan added and the mass of mannan remaining in the supernatant after formulation.
To assess skin and LN innate responses, mice were injected intradermally on day 0 with the indicated compounds in a volume of 50 μl on each side of the back (one side for the compound and the contralateral side for saline of vehicle control). 6 or 24 hours post-injection skin samples at the injection sites and draining (brachial) LNs were collected for subsequent analysis. In selected experiment LNs were also collected 7 and 14 days post-injection.
Skin samples were transferred to a tissue homogenizer and disrupted with beads in 1 ml of TRI Reagent (Zymo Research). Then, samples were centrifuged 12000 g for 10 minutes and 800 μl of cleared supernatant were transferred to a new tube for subsequent RNA isolation.
LNs were weighted on an analytical scale prior to transfer to a tissue homogenizer and disrupted with beads in TRI Reagent as indicated for skin samples or processed to generate a LN cell suspension by modification of a previously published protocol ( Fletcher et al., 2011 20. Fletcher, A.L. ∙ Malhotra, D. ∙ Acton, S.E. ... Reproducible isolation of lymph node stromal cells reveals site-dependent differences in fibroblastic reticular cells Front. Immunol. 2011; 2 :35 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, individual LNs were incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes in 400 μl of digestion mix (IMDM + pen/strep + FBS 2% + collagenase 100 mg/ml + dispase II 100 mg/ml + DNase 10 mg/ml). Then, LNs were ground by pipetting with a 1000 μl tip, supernatants were transferred to new tubes and kept at 4°C while 200 μl of digestion mix were added to the pellets and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. This cycle was repeated one more time, then pooled supernatants of individual LNs were divided into two aliquots: one for flow cytometry analysis, another one was centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes and the cell pellet was resuspended in 800 μl of TRI Reagent for subsequent RNA isolation. In selected experiment LN suspensions were cultured in the presence of Brefeldin A (BioLegend) for 4 hours and then processed for flow cytometry analysis (both surface staining and intracellular cytokine staining).
For specific experiments mice were treated with: anti-CD62L blocking antibody or isotype control, intravenous injections on day -1; anti-IFNγ and anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody or isotype controls, intravenous injections on day -1 and 0; anti-Asialo-GM1 or PBS, intravenous injections on day -1 and 0; anti-Ly6G depleting antibody or isotype control, intraperitoneal injections on day -1 and 0; diphtheria toxin, intravenous injections on day -1 and intradermal injections (co-injected with mannans) on day 0 for CD11c-DTR mice, intraperitoneal injection on day -2 for CD169-DTR mice.
Bone marrow-derived phagocytes were differentiated from murine bone marrow in IMDM + 10% B16-GM-CSF derived supernatant + 10% FBS + pen/strep + L-Gln and used after 7 days of culture. Then, cells were harvested, plated in flat bottom 96 well plates at a density of 10 5 cells/200 μl/well in IMDM + 10% FBS + pen/strep + L-Gln and stimulated with the indicated compounds for 18-21 hours. At the end of stimulation, supernatants were harvested, and TNF and IL-2 concentrations were measured by ELISA (BioLegend) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were detached with PBS + EDTA 2 mM and transferred to a round bottom 96 well plate for subsequent flow cytometry staining and analysis. Alternatively, cells were stimulated for 6 hours, lysed in TRI Reagent and RNA was extracted for gene expression analysis.
Mice were intradermally injected with 500 μg/mouse of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated β-glucans and mannans (in selected experiments mannans were formulated with 100 μg/mouse of AH before injection). At the indicated timepoints dLNs were collected, transferred to a tissue homogenizer and disrupted with beads in 400 μl of deionized water. Then, samples were centrifuged (12000 g for 10 minutes) and cleared supernatants were transferred to a 96 well clear bottom black plate. Fluorescence values were measured with SpectraMax i3x microplate reader (Molecular Devices) and expressed as arbitrary units after background (deionized water) subtraction.
For flow cytometry analysis, cells were first stained with Zombie Red Fixable Viability in PBS for 5 minutes at 4°C, washed once with PBS + BSA 0.2% + NaN 3 0.05% (300 g for 5 minutes) and then stained with antibodies against surface antigens diluted in PBS + BSA 0.2% + NaN 3 0.05% for 20 minutes at 4°C. Cells were then washed, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed again and resuspended in PBS + BSA 0.2% + NaN 3 0.05%. Samples were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer and data were analyzed using FlowJo v.10 software (BD Biosciences). CountBright Absolute Counting Beads were used to quantify absolute cell numbers. In selected experiments, after fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde cells were permeabilized by incubation with a saponin-based permeabilization buffer (BioLegend) for 10 minutes at 4°C and stained with antibodies against intracellular cytokines diluted in permeabilization buffer for 20 minutes at 4°C. Then, cells were washed with permeabilization buffer, resuspended in PBS + BSA 0.2% + NaN 3 0.05% and acquired as indicated before.
For FACS and imaging cytometry, mice were intradermally injected with AF488-mannans and 6 hours later dLNs were harvested to obtain LN cell suspensions. For FACS, cells were stained with antibodies against surface antigens diluted in PBS + BSA 0.2% for 20 minutes at 4°C. Cells were then washed once, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS + BSA 0.2%, filtered through 70 μm cell strainers (Fisher Scientific) and sorted with a Sony MA900 cell sorter directly into 1 ml of TRI Reagent. The following cell subset was sorted: CD3 - CD19 - NK1.1 - Ter119 - CD45 + AF488-mannan + Ly6G - (CD11b + Ly6C + ) - CD11b + CD11c + . For imaging cytometry, cells were depleted of lymphoid and erythroid cells by sequential staining with biotinylated antibodies against anti-CD3, anti-CD19, anti-NK1.1, anti-Ter119 and Streptavidin Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The remaining cells were stained with anti-CD45 APC, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, washed once and resuspended in 60 μl of PBS + DAPI (0.2 μg/ml). Samples were then acquired on an Amnis ImageStream X Mark II (Luminex Corporation). Mannan internalization was analyzed with Amnis Ideas Software and calculated with Internalization Feature as AF488 signal within the APC mask.
For confocal microscopy, dLNs were isolated at steady state or 1 hour post-injection of AF488-mannans and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Tissue slides were prepared from frozen LN samples at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Histology Core Facility and stained at the BIDMC Confocal Imaging Core Facility. Briefly, frozen sections were air-dried for 30 minutes and rehydrated. The sections were permeabilized using 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature and washed three times with TBS. The sections were then incubated with 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab) for 1 hour at room temperature. For Dectin-2 staining of steady state LNs, slides were incubated with rat anti-Dectin-2 overnight at 4 ° C. The slides were washed three times and incubated with: Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Donkey anti-rat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab) for 90 minutes at room temperature and washed four times. Slides were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated rat anti-CD169 primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated rat anti-CD45R/B220 primary antibody for 90 minutes at room temperature and then washed with TBS. For phospho-Syk staining of AF488-mannan-treated LNs, slides were incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-Syk (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 ° C. The slides were washed three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab) for 90 minutes at room temperature and washed four times. Slides were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated rat anti-CD45R/B220 primary antibody for 90 minutes at room temperature and then washed with TBS. rabbit anti-phospho-Syk (Cell Signaling Technology). Samples were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and washed three times with TBS. Slides were mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade mounting media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged on a Zeiss 880 laser scanning confocal microscope at the Boston Children’s Hospital Harvard Digestive Disease Center.
RNA was isolated from TRI Reagent samples using phenol-chloroform extraction or column-based extraction systems (Direct-zol RNA Microprep and Miniprep, Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration and purity (260/280 and 260/230 ratios) were measured by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Purified RNA was analyzed for gene expression by qPCR on a CFX384 real time cycler (Bio-rad) using pre-designed KiCqStart SYBR Green Primers (MilliporeSigma) specific for Cxcl9 (M_Cxcl9_1), Gbp2 (M_Gpb2_1), Ifit2 (M_Ifit2_1), Rsad2 (M_Rsad2_1), Il6 (M_Il6_1), Cxcl1 (M_Cxcl1_1), Rpl13a (M_Rpl13a_1) or pre-designed PrimeTime qPCR Primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) specific for Gapdh (Mm.PT.39a.1).
For bulk RNAseq analysis, RNA isolated from skin or LN samples was submitted to Genewiz. RNA samples were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA integrity was checked with RNA Screen Tape on Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). RNA sequencing library preparation was prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA library Prep kit following manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, Cat# RS-122-2101). Briefly, mRNAs were first enriched with Oligod(T) beads. Enriched mRNAs were fragmented for 8 minutes at 94°C. First strand and second strand cDNA were subsequently synthesized. The second strand of cDNA was marked by incorporating dUTP during the synthesis. cDNA fragments were adenylated at 3’ends, and indexed adapter was ligated to cDNA fragments. Limited cycle PCR was used for library enrichment. The incorporated dUTP in second strand cDNA quenched the amplification of second strand, which helped to preserve the strand specificity. Sequencing libraries were validated using DNA Analysis Screen Tape on the Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies), and quantified by using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as well as by quantitative PCR (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing libraries were multiplexed and clustered on 1 lane of flowcell. After clustering, the flowcell was loaded on the Illumina HiSeq instrument according to manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were sequenced using a 2x150 Pair-End (PE) High Output configuration. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) on the HiSeq instrument. Raw sequence data (.bcl files) generated from Illumina HiSeq was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq program version 2.17. One mismatch was allowed for index sequence identification. Reads were quality-controlled using FastQC. Illumina adapters were removed using cutadapt. Trimmed reads were mapped to the mouse transcriptome (GRCm38) based on Ensembl annotations using Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 8. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (5202) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcript counts were imported and aggregated to gene counts using tximport ( Soneson et al., 2015 65. Soneson, C. ∙ Love, M.I. ∙ Robinson, M.D. Differential analyses for RNA-seq: transcript-level estimates improve gene-level inferences F1000Res. 2015; 4 :1521 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene counts were analyzed using the R package DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 40. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). When applicable, batch was used as a blocking factor in the statistical model. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified as those passing a threshold of FDR significance threshold (0.05 for skin; 0.01 for lymph nodes, a more stringent threshold thanks to the greater power due to higher number of replicates) where the alternate hypothesis was that the absolute log 2 FC was greater than 0. Genes induced by mannan or glucan treatment over saline were plotted in heatmaps using the R package ComplexHeatmap, using Z-scored log 2 normalized abundance. Genes were arranged by abundance delta between glucan and mannan (aggregated from multiple time points when appropriate), with a gap delimiting two clusters: genes more highly expressed upon mannan stimulation vs genes more highly expressed upon glucan stimulation. Pathway analysis was performed with the R package hypeR ( Federico and Monti, 2020 19. Federico, A. ∙ Monti, S. hypeR: an R package for geneset enrichment workflows Bioinformatics. 2020; 36 :1307-1308 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), using hypergeometric enrichment tests of genes belonging to a cluster of interest and the Hallmark gene set collection from the Broad Institute's MSigDB collection.
For targeted transcriptome sequencing, 25 ng of RNA isolated from sorted cells was retrotranscribed to cDNA using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Barcoded libraries were prepared using the Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Mouse Gene Expression Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced using an Ion S5 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the ampliSeqRNA plugin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To quantify the number of DEGs, gene-level fold change < -1.5 or > 1.5 and gene-level p value < 0.05 (ANOVA) were considered. For heatmap representation, DEGs were defined with an F-test FDR less than 0.05 and a log 2 fold-change (FC) greater than 1 (or lower than -1) between a mutant and WT control. Hierarchical clustering was performed with Pearson correlation and average linkage. Pathway analysis was performed with the R package hypeR, using Kolmogorov Smirnov Test on genes ranked according to their log2FC.
Spleens were isolated from OT-II or OT-I mice and meshed with the plunger end of a syringe. Then, splenocyte cell suspensions were treated with ACK lysis buffer (2 ml for 2 minutes at room temperature), washed with PBS (300 g for 5 minutes) and filtered through 70 μm cell strainers. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were respectively purified using CD4 (L3T4) or CD8a (Ly-2) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and stained with CellTrace CFSE (5 μM in PBS + FBS 2.5% for 20 minutes in the dark). At the end of incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended at a concentration of 5 x 10 5 cells/100 μl saline and 100 μl of cell suspension was intravenously injected into each mouse. 24 hours later (day 0) mice were intradermally injected with OVA (5 μg/mouse) alone or combined with mannans (500 μg/mouse). Saline-injected mice were used as control. On day +3 dLNs were harvested and LN cell suspension were stained with anti-CD19, anti-Ter119, anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies. Adoptively transferred, CFSE-labelled OT-II and OT-I cells were respectively detected in the CD19 - Ter119 - CD3 + CD4 + and CD19 - Ter119 - CD3 + CD8 + gates. Results are expressed as absolute number of CD19 - Ter119 - CD3 + CD4 + CFSE lo or CD19 - Ter119 - CD3 + CD8 + CFSE lo cells (i.e., cells undergoing at least one division cycle) or percentage of each division peak within the CD19 - Ter119 - CD3 + CD4 + or CD19 - Ter119 - CD3 + CD8 + gates.
Full length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and RBD constructs (amino acid residues R319-K529), both with an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag at C-terminus, were obtained from Drs. Barney S. Graham (NIH Vaccine Research Center) and Aaron G. Schmidt (Ragon Institute), respectively. These expression vectors were used to transiently transfect Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using polyethylenimine (Polysciences). Protein was purified from filtered cell supernatants using either StrepTactin resin (IBA) or Cobalt-TALON resin (Takara). Affinity tags were cleaved off from eluted protein samples by HRV3C protease and tag removed proteins were subjected to additional purification by size-exclusion chromatography using either a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) or a Superdex 75 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) in PBS (pH 7.4) buffer.
CB6F1 mice were immunized by intradermal injection of Spike (1 μg/mouse) alone or formulated with AH (100 μg/mouse), β-glucans (500 μg/mouse), mannans (500 μg/mouse), alum (AH)/mannans (AH/mann), AddaS03 or AH/PHAD on day 0 and day +14. Alternatively, C57BL/6 mice were immunized by intradermal injection Flublok vaccine (1 μg/mouse) alone or formulated with AH, AH/mann, AddaVax or AH/PHAD on day 0 and day +14. Saline-injected mice were used as control. Blood samples were collected by retroorbital bleeding on day +14 (pre-boost) and day +28, and serum samples were isolated after centrifugation of blood samples twice at 1500 g for 10 minutes. In selected experiments blood samples were collected on day +98 or 7 days post-challenge. Spike-, RBD-, Flublok- and rPR8-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2c antibody levels were quantified in serum samples by ELISA by modification of a previously described protocol ( Borriello et al., 2017 6. Borriello, F. ∙ Pietrasanta, C. ∙ Lai, J.C.Y. ... Identification and characterization of stimulator of interferon genes as a robust adjuvant target for early life immunization Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :1772 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, high binding flat bottom 96-well plates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml Spike, 1 μg/ml RBD, 1 μg/ml Flublok or 1 μg/ml rPR8 in PBS, incubated overnight at 4°C, washed once with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) and blocked with PBS + BSA 1% for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, serum samples were added with an initial dilution of 1:100 and 1:4 serial dilutions in PBS + BSA 1% to generate 11-point curves and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were then washed three times with PBST and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 or IgG2c (Southern Biotech) antibodies. At the end of the incubation, plates were washed five times with PBST and developed with tetramethylbenzidine (BD OptEIA Substrate Solution for Spike, rHA, and rPR8; Thermo Fisher Scientific 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution for RBD ELISA) for 5 min, then stopped with 2 N H 2 SO 4 . Optical densities (ODs) were read at 450 nm with SpectraMax iD3x microplate reader (Molecular Devices) and endpoint titers were calculated using as cutoff three times the optical density of the background. Values < 100 were reported as 25.
Immunized mice were sacrificed on day 35 and their spleens were collected. To isolate splenocytes, spleens were mashed through a 70 μm cell strainer and the resulting cell suspensions were washed with PBS and incubated with ACK lysis buffer (2 ml for 2 minutes at room temperature) to lyse erythrocytes. Splenocytes were re-washed with PBS and plated in flat bottom 96-well plates (2 x 10 6 cells per well). Then, SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptides (PepTivator SARS-CoV-2 Prot_S, Miltenyi Biotec) were added at a final concentration of 0.6 nmol/ml (total cell culture volume, 200 μl per well). After 96 hours, supernatants were harvested and IFNγ levels were measured by ELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The surrogate virus neutralization test was performed by modification of a previously published protocol ( Tan et al., 2020 67. Tan, C.W. ∙ Chia, W.N. ∙ Qin, X. ... A SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test based on antibody-mediated blockage of ACE2-spike protein-protein interaction Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1073-1078 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, high binding flat bottom 96-well plates were coated with 2 μg/ml recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2, MilliporeSigma) in PBS, incubated overnight at 4°C, washed three times with PBST and blocked with PBS + BSA 1% for 1 hour at room temperature. In the meantime, each serum sample (final dilution 1:160) was pre-incubated with 3 ng of RBD-Fc (R&D Systems) in PBS + BSA 1% for 1 hour at room temperature and then transferred to the hACE2-coated plate. As positive control, RBD-Fc was also added to hACE2-coated wells without pre-incubation with serum samples. After 1 hour at room temperature, plates were washed three times with PBST and incubated with an HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Southern Biotech) for 1 hour at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, plates were washed five times with PBST and developed with tetramethylbenzidine (BD Biosciences) for 5 min, then stopped with 2 N H 2 SO 4 . The optical density was read at 450 nm with SpectraMax iD3x microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Percentage inhibition of RBD binding to hACE2 was calculated with the following formula: Inhibition (%) = [1 - (Sample OD value - Background OD value) / (Control OD value - Background OD value)] x 100.
All serum samples were heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes to deactivate complement and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to processing for neutralization titer. Samples were diluted in duplicate to an initial dilution of 1:5 or 1:10 followed by 1:2 serial dilutions, resulting in a 12-dilution series with each well containing 100 μl. All dilutions were performed in DMEM (Quality Biological), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated, MilliporeSigma), 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bio-products) and 1% (v/v) L-glutamine (2 mM final concentration, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Dilution plates were then transported into the BSL-3 laboratory and 100 μl of diluted SARS-CoV-2 (WA-1, courtesy of Dr. Natalie Thornburg/CDC) inoculum was added to each well to result in a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 upon transfer to titering plates. A non-treated, virus-only control and a mock infection control were included on every plate. The sample/virus mixture was then incubated at 37°C (5.0% CO 2 ) for 1 hour before transferring to 96-well titer plates with confluent VeroE6 cells. Titer plates were incubated at 37°C (5.0% CO 2 ) for 72 hours, followed by cytopathic effect (CPE) determination for each well in the plate. The first sample dilution to show CPE was reported as the minimum sample dilution required to neutralize >99% of the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 tested (neut99).
We performed phage IP and sequencing as described previously ( Xu et al., 2015a 74. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ) with slight modifications. A sublibrary encoding a 56-mer peptide library tiling every 28 amino acids through the proteomes of the six HCoVs and three bat coronaviruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 ( Shrock et al., 2020 63. Shrock, E. ∙ Fujimura, E. ∙ Kula, T. ... Viral epitope profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals cross-reactivity and correlates of severity Science. 2020; 370 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ) was mixed with the original VirScan library to enable mapping of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. 0.6 μl mouse sera, or approximately 2 μg of IgG, was included in each VirScan reaction. Immunoprecipitations were performed using magnetic protein A and protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described ( Xu et al., 2015a 74. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine prior to intranasal inoculation with 1x10 4 pfu MA-10 ( Leist et al., 2020 36. Leist, S.R. ∙ Dinnon, 3rd, K.H. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... A mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 induces acute lung injury and mortality in standard laboratory mice Cell. 2020; 183 :1070-1085 e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ) per mouse in 50μL PBS. Weights were measured daily starting from the day of inoculation (Day 0) to the day of euthanization (Day 2). Two days post-infection, mice were euthanized with isoflurane and dissected. The entire left lung was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for histology and the right lung was halved and stored in either TRIzol for RNA isolation or PBS for titering by plaque assay.
The day prior to infection, 2x10 5 VeroE6 cells (ATCC, CRL-1586) were seeded per well in 12-well plates. Lung samples were homogenized and then 25μL of each sample was serially diluted 1:10 in 225μL DMEM. Media was removed from the cells and 200μL of each dilution was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for one hour, rocking every 15 minutes. The cells were then overlaid with 2mL of a semi-solid agar overlay (DMEM+2%FBS+0.05% w/v Ultra Pure Agarose (Invitrogen, A9539). Plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for 72 hours before being fixed with 4% PFA and stained with a 0.25% w/v crystal violet + 20% Ethanol solution. Plaques were counted and titers calculated.
C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized by isoflurane before intranasally inoculated with 50 μl of 4 x 10 3 plaque-forming units (PFU) of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1). Mice were monitored daily and the body weights were recorded for 7 days. On day 7 post-infection mice were sacrificed and lungs were collected for histological analysis.
When necessary, data were Log-transformed before statistical analysis to approximate normal distributions. One-sample t test was used to compare each group against the value 1 (or 0 after Log-transformation, which represent the contralateral control sample expressed as fold). Statistical differences between groups in datasets with one categorical variable were evaluated by two sample t test (2 groups) or one-way ANOVA (more than 2 groups) corrected for multiple comparisons. Statistical differences between groups in datasets with two categorical variables were evaluated by two-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons. # or ∗ and ∗∗ or ## respectively indicate p ≤ 0.05 and 0.01.
