Title: TIR domains of plant immune receptors are 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetases mediating cell death


Abstract: Summary

2′,3′-cAMP is a positional isomer of the well-established second messenger 3′,5′-cAMP, but little is known about the biology of this noncanonical cyclic nucleotide monophosphate (cNMP). Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors have the NADase function necessary but insufficient to activate plant immune responses. Here, we show that plant TIR proteins, besides being NADases, act as 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetases by hydrolyzing RNA/DNA. Structural data show that a TIR domain adopts distinct oligomers with mutually exclusive NADase and synthetase activity. Mutations specifically disrupting the synthetase activity abrogate TIR-mediated cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana ( Nb ), supporting an important role for these cNMPs in TIR signaling. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis negative regulator of TIR-NLR signaling, NUDT7, displays 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP but not 3′,5′-cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase activity and suppresses cell death activity of TIRs in Nb . Our study identifies a family of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetases and establishes a critical role for them in plant immune responses.

Section: Introduction

2′,3′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (2′,3′-cAMP) is a regioisomer of the canonical second messenger 3′,5′-cAMP, but little is known about the noncanonical cyclic nucleotide monophosphate (cNMP). It was not until recently that 2′,3′-cAMP was identified in animals ( Ren et al., 2009 54. Ren, J. ∙ Mi, Z. ∙ Stewart, N.A. ... Identification and quantification of 2′,3′-cAMP release by the kidney J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2009; 328 :855-865 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in plants ( Van Damme et al., 2014 67. Van Damme, T. ∙ Blancquaert, D. ∙ Couturon, P. ... Wounding stress causes rapid increase in concentration of the naturally occurring 2′,3′-isomers of cyclic guanosine- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cGMP and cAMP) in plant tissues Phytochemistry. 2014; 103 :59-66 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). The occurrence of 2′,3′-cAMP and other 2′,3′-cNMPs has now been shown in different kingdoms ( Jackson, 2017 28. Jackson, E.K. Non-canonical cyclic Nucleotides: discovery and roles of 2,3-cAMP in biological systems Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2017; 238 :229-252 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). mRNA turnover by RNases can produce 2′,3′-cNMPs ( Jackson, 2017 28. Jackson, E.K. Non-canonical cyclic Nucleotides: discovery and roles of 2,3-cAMP in biological systems Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2017; 238 :229-252 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Studies in animals support a physiological role for 2′,3′-cNMPs in response to injury ( Azarashvili et al., 2009 2. Azarashvili, T. ∙ Krestinina, O. ∙ Galvita, A. ...

In Arabidopsis , wounding ( Van Damme et al., 2014 67. Van Damme, T. ∙ Blancquaert, D. ∙ Couturon, P. ...

Interaction of 2′,3′-cAMP with Rbp47b plays a role in stress granule formation Plant Physiol. 2018; 177 :411-421 PubMed Google Scholar ) and mimics the abiotic stress response in Arabidopsis ( Chodasiewicz et al., 2022 11.

The metabolization of 2′,3′-cNMPs to 2′-NMPs and 3′-NMPs has been demonstrated ( Trapp et al., 1988 65. Trapp, B.D. ∙ Bernier, L. ∙ Andrews, S.B. ...

Plant defense against microbial pathogens is built on a two-tiered immune system that consists of an interdependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) ( Ngou et al., 2021 44. Ngou, B.P.M. ∙ Ahn, H.K. ∙ Ding, P. ...

Yuan, M. ∙ Jiang, Z. ∙ Bi, G. ... Pattern-recognition receptors are required for NLR-mediated plant immunity Nature. 2021; 592 :105-109 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ). ETI is typically mediated by intracellular nucleotide-binding (NB) leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors, which recognize strain-specific pathogen effectors delivered inside plant cells. NLRs can be largely divided into two groups, with N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) or N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. Recognition of pathogen effectors induces oligomeric NLR complexes termed resistosomes ( Xiong et al., 2020 77. Xiong, Y. ∙ Han, Z. ∙ Chai, J. Resistosome and inflammasome: platforms mediating innate immunity Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2020; 56 :47-55 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Activation of NLR resistosomes induces ETI responses, often including a hypersensitive response (HR), a form of regulated cell death that is localized to sites of attempted pathogen infection. Whereas the CC-NLR (CNL) ZAR1 resistosome is a Ca 2+ -permeable cation channel ( Bi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019 7. Bi, G. ∙ Su, M. ∙ Li, N. ...

TIR domains of plant immune receptors are NAD(+)-cleaving enzymes that promote cell death Science. 2019; 365 :799-803 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). The NADase activity is required for the activation of two immune signaling nodes, EDS1-SAG101 and EDS1-PAD4 heterodimers and the “helper” NLRs (RNLs), ADR1s, and NRG1s ( Castel et al., 2019 10.

Once TNLs are activated, EDS1-PAD4 and EDS1-SAG101 form hetero complexes with ADR1s and NRG1s, respectively ( Sun et al., 2021 62. Sun, X. ∙ Lapin, D. ∙ Feehan, J.M. ...

EDS1 signaling is also involved in abiotic stress responses of plants ( Suzuki et al., 2012 63. Suzuki, N. ∙ Koussevitzky, S. ∙ Mittler, R. ...

Wiermer, M. ∙ Feys, B.J. ∙ Parker, J.E. Plant immunity: the EDS1 regulatory node Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8 :383-389 Crossref Scopus (474) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Arabidopsis , EDS1 signaling is negatively regulated by AtNUDT7 , a nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X (Nudix) hydrolase, and its closest homolog AtNUDT6 ( Bartsch et al., 2006 3.

In addition to canonical TNLs, plant genomes encode many TIR proteins consisting only of a TIR domain (TIR-only or TX) or TIR-NB (TN) ( Collier et al., 2011 12.

USA. 2017; 114 :E2053-E2062 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, the TIR-only protein RBA1 in Arabidopsis Ag-0 triggers EDS1-dependent immune signaling in response to the bacterial pathogen effector HopBA1 ( Nishimura et al., 2017 47.

A truncated NLR protein, TIR-NBS2, is required for activated defense responses in the exo70B1 mutant PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 , e1004945 Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar ), indicating that TIR-containing members share a conserved signaling pathway to mediate immune responses. Cell death mediated by TIR-containing proteins depends on a conserved putative catalytic glutamate ( Wan et al., 2019 69. Wan, L. ∙ Essuman, K. ∙ Anderson, R.G. ... TIR domains of plant immune receptors are NAD(+)-cleaving enzymes that promote cell death Science. 2019; 365 :799-803 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). TIR NADase activity is essential but not sufficient for cell death and defense activation ( Duxbury et al., 2020 16. Duxbury, Z. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ MacKenzie, C.I. ... Induced proximity of a TIR signaling domain on a plant-mammalian NLR chimera activates defense in plants Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

TIR domains of plant immune receptors are NAD(+)-cleaving enzymes that promote cell death Science. 2019; 365 :799-803 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that additional signaling components are needed to fully activate TIR-mediated immune responses.
Here, we show that plant TIR domain proteins produce 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP via hydrolysis of RNA and probably DNA (RNA/DNA unless defined otherwise). Nuclease activity was not sufficient for TIR-mediated cell death, as TIR mutants retaining both nuclease and NADase activity but lacking the 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetase (referred to synthetase hereafter) activity failed to trigger cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana ( Nb ). The structural basis of TIR proteins as bifunctional enzymes was revealed by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-bound TIR domain of flax TNL L7 (L7 TIR ) that recognizes the flax rust fungus effector AvrL567 ( Dodds et al., 2006 14. Dodds, P.N. ∙ Lawrence, G.J. ∙ Catanzariti, A.M. ... Direct protein interaction underlies gene-for-gene specificity and coevolution of the flax resistance genes and flax rust avirulence genes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :8888-8893 Crossref Scopus (598) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specific disruption of the synthetase activity in vitro greatly suppressed TIR-mediated cell death in Nb , indicating that this enzymatic activity is required for TIR signaling. Moreover, At NUDT7 and the oomycete pathogen effector Avr3b function as 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in vitro . Furthermore, co-expression of wild-type (WT) AtNUDT7 , but not its catalytic mutant, suppressed RBA1-mediated cell death in Nb . As Nudix hydrolases are highly conserved throughout all organisms ( McLennan, 2006 39. McLennan, A.G. The Nudix hydrolase superfamily Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63 :123-143 Crossref Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ), our findings open opportunities for the study of 2′,3′-cNMPs beyond plants.

Section: Results

When assaying RBA1 NADase activity, we found that the TIR-only protein hydrolyzed many metabolites besides nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized form (NAD + ) ( Figures S1 A and S1B). All these in vitro RBA1 substrates contain phosphodiester bonds, prompting us to test if DNA and RNA are RBA1 substrates. The purified RBA1 protein exhibited activity of degrading PCR product ( Figure 1 A, left), plasmid DNA ( Figure 1 A, right) or Arabidopsis genomic DNA (gDNA) ( Figure 1 B). RBA1 displayed a much higher nuclease activity when Arabidopsis total RNA ( At RNA) was used as the substrate ( Figures 1 A–1C, S1 C, and S1D). The nuclease activity appears to be a general feature of TIR proteins, as several TIR proteins tested including L7 TIR also displayed the activity of degrading Arabidopsis gDNA and total RNA ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Furthermore, RBA1 and several other TIR proteins exhibited clear cleavage activity toward a fluorescent DNA probe ( Figure 1 D). Unlike DNase I, TIR-catalyzed production of the fluorescent product appears not to obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
We then investigated whether the nuclease activity is associated with TIR-mediated cell death in planta . Cys132 of L7 TIR is highly conserved among plant TIR proteins ( Figure S1 E) ( Lapin et al., 2022 34. Lapin, D. ∙ Johanndrees, O. ∙ Wu, Z. ... Molecular innovations in plant TIR-based immunity signaling Plant Cell. 2022; 00 :1-18 Google Scholar ; Johanndrees et al., 2021 31. Johanndrees, O. ∙ Baggs, L.E. ∙ Uhlmann, C. ... Differential EDS1 requirement for cell death activities of plant TIR-domain proteins Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The equivalent cysteine residue is important for cell death mediated by grape RPV1 TIR ( Williams et al., 2016 73. Williams, S.J. ∙ Yin, L. ∙ Foley, G. ... Structure and function of the TIR domain from the grape NLR protein RPV1 Front. Plant Sci. 2016; 7 :1850 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) and L6 TIR ( Bernoux et al., 2011 5. Bernoux, M. ∙ Ve, T. ∙ Williams, S. ... Structural and functional analysis of a plant resistance protein TIR domain reveals interfaces for self-association, signaling, and autoregulation Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 9 :200-211 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ) in N. tabacum ( Nt ). The residue at this position is substituted with Thr in the bacterial Acinetobacter baumannii TIR ( Ab TIR) ( Figure S1 E), which possesses NADase activity but has no cell death activity in Nt ( Duxbury et al., 2020 16. Duxbury, Z. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ MacKenzie, C.I. ... Induced proximity of a TIR signaling domain on a plant-mammalian NLR chimera activates defense in plants Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :18832-18839 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results suggest that the phenotype caused by mutation of the conserved cysteine residue in L6 TIR and RPV1 TIR in planta is probably not due to the absence of their NADase activity. Indeed, L7 TIR C132A had little impact on the NADase activity of L7 TIR ( Figure S1 F). Unexpectedly, however, the L7 TIR mutant protein also retained nuclease activity comparable with that of the WT protein ( Figure S1 F). These results suggest that the nuclease activity, if important, is not sufficient for the cell death activity of TIRs in planta .
The data above suggest that there are unknown molecules generated by TIR-mediated degradation of RNA/DNA for the cell death activity. To probe this possibility, we analyzed products of At RNA or gDNA incubated with L7 TIR using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Incubation of L7 TIR with At RNA or gDNA, but not L7 TIR , the RNA, or DNA alone, gave rise to two distinct peaks, one with a parent ion of 330 m / z ( Figures 1 E, 1F, S1 G, and S1H) and the other 346 m / z ( Figures 1 G, 1H, S1 G, and S1H), corresponding to the molecular weight of 3′,5′-cAMP and 3′,5′-cGMP, respectively. However, the retention time of these two unknown substances matches that of neither standard 3′,5′-cAMP nor standard 3′,5′-cGMP ( Figures 1 E, 1G, and S1 G). LC-MS assays showed that the retention time of 330 and 346 m / z was identical to that of the standard 2′,3′-cAMP and 2′,3′-cGMP, respectively ( Figures 1 E, 1G, and S1 G). The identities of the two unknown substances were further confirmed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) ( Figures 1 E and 1G) and high-resolution MS analyses ( Figures 1 F and 1H). Similar results were obtained with the products from RBA1 incubated with At RNA or gDNA as the substrate ( Figure S1 I). The synthetase activity of L7 TIR appears to be conserved among TIR proteins, as several Arabidopsis TIR proteins, including RBA1, produced these two cNMPs when Arabidopsis gDNA ( Figure S1 K) or At RNA ( Figure S1 L) was used as the substrate. As a control, fungal RNase T1, but not DNase I, showed similar activity in producing 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP ( Figure S1 J). These data demonstrate that TIR domains act as synthetases with RNA/DNA as substrates.
During protein purification, we found that several TIR proteins, including L7 TIR , were eluted at the void position of a Superose 6 gel filtration column, suggesting the formation of large “aggregates” of these TIR proteins. The aggregates appeared to contain nucleic acids as evidenced by UV absorbance at the wavelength of 260 nm ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Visualization of the negatively stained large molecular weight species revealed filament or filament-like structures ( Figure S2 A). Notably, the filaments formed by L7 TIR following the removal of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag were more uniform ( Figure S2 A). Then, we solved the cryo-EM structures of the L7 TIR filaments ( Figures S2 C–F), representing an initial dsDNA/dsRNA binding state, an intermediate state, and an end state of DNA/RNA hydrolysis, with a resolution of 3.3, 2.7, and 2.6 Å, respectively ( Figures S2 G–S2J; Table S1 ).
In the initial dsDNA/RNA binding state, the L7 TIR filament is composed of 4 protofilaments with the two outer ones being made of L7 TIR ( Figure 2 A). Sandwiched between the two L7 TIR protofilaments are two thinner protofilaments, which clearly come from dsDNA or dsRNA ( Figure 2 A), although the density does not allow a distinction. dsDNA was modeled to the helical-shaped density because it was more resistant to TIR degradation compared with RNA in vitro ( Figures 1 A, 1B, S1 C, and S1D). Nonetheless, dsDNA cleavage can be found in part of the L7 TIR -dsDNA complex, as represented by the structures of the intermediate (∼3 base pairs of dsDNA bound) and the end state (0–1 base pair of dsDNA bound) of L7 TIR filaments ( Figures S2 I–S2K). Interactions of the two L7 TIR protofilaments mediated by the two dsDNA protofilaments result in the formation of a superhelical structure ( Figures 2 A and S2 N).
The L7 TIR protofilaments contain two types of symmetric homodimers. One is mediated by the interface involving helices αA and αE (AE interface) ( Figure 2 B) seen in the crystal structures of TIR domains ( Bernoux et al., 2011 5.

Nimma, S. ∙ Ve, T. ∙ Williams, S.J. ... Towards the structure of the TIR-domain signalosome Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2017; 43 :122-130 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Propagation of the AE dimers through the interaction of two L7 TIR monomers of two adjacent AE dimers forms the second type of the L7 TIR dimer ( Figure 2 B) that is nearly identical to the dimer in the crystal structure of L6 TIR mediated by the interface involving helices αD and αE (DE interface) ( Figure S2 L). This interface is conserved in many TIR proteins and is required for their cell death activities ( Nishimura et al., 2017 47. Nishimura, M.T. ∙ Anderson, R.G. ∙ Cherkis, K.A. ... TIR-only protein RBA1 recognizes a pathogen effector to regulate cell death in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2053-E2062 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 80. Zhang, X. ∙ Bernoux, M. ∙ Bentham, A.R. ... Multiple functional self-association interfaces in plant TIR domains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2046-E2052 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). The L7 TIR protofilaments are reminiscent of a structural model of the L6 TIR domain higher order assembly ( Zhang et al., 2017 80. Zhang, X. ∙ Bernoux, M. ∙ Bentham, A.R. ... Multiple functional self-association interfaces in plant TIR domains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2046-E2052 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Parallel packing of the two AE dimers via the DE interface generates a tetrameric L7 TIR , which is different from the closed tetrameric TIR in the RPP1 resistosome ( Figure 2 B). Asymmetric L7 TIR dimers similar to those important for the NADase activity of the TNL resistosomes are absent in the tetrameric L7 TIR . Along each L7 TIR protofilament are two positively charged surfaces sandwiching two dsDNAs ( Figure 2 C). We cannot assign the sequence of the modeled dsDNA due to its limited quality of cryo-EM density. However, the L7 TIR makes no base-specific contacts with the dsDNA, indicating non-sequence-specific binding to dsDNA/dsRNA by L7 TIR . This is consistent with sequence-independent cleavage of Arabidopsis or barley total RNA in vitro ( Figure S1 C).
The formation of asymmetric TIR dimers is required for NADase activity of TNLs ( Ma et al., 2020 36. Ma, S. ∙ Lapin, D. ∙ Liu, L. ... Direct pathogen-induced assembly of an NLR immune receptor complex to form a holoenzyme Science. 2020; 370 , eabe3069 Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar ; Martin et al., 2020 38. Martin, R. ∙ Qi, T. ∙ Zhang, H. ... Structure of the activated ROQ1 resistosome directly recognizing the pathogen effector XopQ Science. 2020; 370 , eabd9993 Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar ). The lack of such dimers suggests that L7 TIR in the filaments cannot hydrolyze NAD + . This was confirmed by the NADase activity assay of the L7 TIR protein eluted at the void position in gel filtration ( Figure 2 D, left) with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ( Figure 2 D, right). By contrast, the L7 TIR protein at the position with lower molecular weight species ( Figure 2 D, middle) fully consumed NAD + under the same conditions. These results suggest that L7 TIR forms distinct oligomers for its synthetase and NADase activity.
The distance between two adjacent L7 TIR along the two outer protofilaments is ∼3.5 nm ( Figure 2 B), close to the length of one turn of dsDNA (3.4 nm). This allows L7 TIR αD from one side of the outer protofilaments to periodically interact with the major groove of the dsDNA via electrostatic interaction ( Figures 2 A and 3 A), which is characteristic of major groove binders of dsDNA ( Eckel et al., 2003 17. Eckel, R. ∙ Ros, R. ∙ Ros, A. ... Identification of binding mechanisms in single molecule-DNA complexes Biophys. J. 2003; 85 :1968-1973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). A cluster of basic residues from αD is solvent exposed and largely conserved among TIR proteins ( Figure S1 E). Additionally, the loop connecting αB and βB (called the BB-loop) of L7 TIR , with different conformation from that of its equivalent of L6 TIR ( Figure S3 A), also contacts the backbones of dsDNA ( Figure 3 A). BB-loops are also critical to mediate the formation of asymmetric dimerization of RPP1 TIR ( Ma et al., 2020 36. Ma, S. ∙ Lapin, D. ∙ Liu, L. ... Direct pathogen-induced assembly of an NLR immune receptor complex to form a holoenzyme Science. 2020; 370 , eabe3069 Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar ) and Roq1 TIR ( Martin et al., 2020 38. Martin, R. ∙ Qi, T. ∙ Zhang, H. ... Structure of the activated ROQ1 resistosome directly recognizing the pathogen effector XopQ Science. 2020; 370 , eabd9993 Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar ). These results suggest that the BB-loop is likely important for both NADase and synthetase activity of TIR proteins. The AE interface in L7 TIR filaments is highly conserved in other TIRs ( Figure S2 L). As in the crystal structure of L6 TIR ( Bernoux et al., 2011 5. Bernoux, M. ∙ Ve, T. ∙ Williams, S. ... Structural and functional analysis of a plant resistance protein TIR domain reveals interfaces for self-association, signaling, and autoregulation Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 9 :200-211 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ), the DE interface in the L7 TIR filaments is mainly mediated by van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts ( Figure 3 B). Hydrophobic residues are also conserved at this corresponding position in other TIRs ( Figure S2 L).
To investigate whether the dsDNA-αD interaction is important for the synthetase activity of L7 TIR , we made a simultaneous mutation K171A/K172A/R175A (KKR AAA ) for the basic residues from this helix. In contrast to WT L7 TIR , the KKR AAA protein was eluted only at the position of the low molecular species in gel filtration ( Figure 3 C), indicating that the mutant has lost its filament-forming activity. Similar effects were also observed with K176A/K180A (KK AA ) and K100A/G101A/K102A/E103A (KGKE AAAA ) mutations predicted to disrupt αD and BB-loop interactions with dsDNA, respectively ( Figure 3 C). Furthermore, KKR AAA significantly diminished the activity of L7 TIR nuclease ( Figures 3 D and S3 D) and synthetase ( Figures 3 E, S3 B, and S3C). These basic residues are not involved in the formation of the AE dimer and the predicted asymmetric L7 TIR dimer. Indeed, the KKR AAA mutation had little impact on the NADase activity of the TIR protein ( Figure 3 F).
Supporting an essential role of the DE interface in the filament-forming activity of L7 TIR , L7 TIR K200E at this interface ( Figure 3 B) was eluted only at the low molecular species position ( Figure 3 C). As expected, the mutation greatly reduced L7 TIR nuclease ( Figures 3 D and S3 D) and synthetase ( Figures 3 E and S3 C) activity but not its NADase activity ( Figure 3 F). By comparison, all three L7 TIR enzymatic activities were reduced by F79A/E209A (FE AA ) from the AE interface ( Figures 3 C–3F). Taken together, these data show that TIR oligomers mediated by different interface combinations confer synthetase or NADase activity.
In addition to 2′,3′-cNMPs, RNA cleavage by RNases also generates 2′,3′-cyclophosphate-terminated RNA oligonucleotides ( Jackson, 2017 28. Jackson, E.K. Non-canonical cyclic Nucleotides: discovery and roles of 2,3-cAMP in biological systems Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2017; 238 :229-252 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, this type of RNA oligonucleotides generated by RNase T2 act as PAMPs recognized by Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) to stimulate innate immune responses in humans ( Greulich et al., 2019 24. Greulich, W. ∙ Wagner, M. ∙ Gaidt, M.M. ... TLR8 is a sensor of RNase T2 degradation products Cell. 2019; 179 :1264-1275 e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ostendorf et al., 2020 50. Ostendorf, T. ∙ Zillinger, T. ∙ Andryka, K. ... Immune sensing of synthetic, bacterial, and protozoan RNA by toll-like receptor 8 requires coordinated processing by RNase T2 and RNase 2 Immunity. 2020; 52 :591-605 e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested whether TIRs produce similar RNA oligonucleotides. LC-MS assay of At RNA incubated with L7 TIR showed that the products contained no chemical species with a molecular weight corresponding to 2′,3′-cAMP- or 2′,3′-cGMP-terminated RNA dinucleotides ( Figure 4 A). By contrast, fungal RNase T1, a guanine base-specific RNase ( Yoshida, 2001 78. Yoshida, H. The ribonuclease T1 family Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341 :28-41 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ), strongly promoted the production of compounds with molecular weights corresponding to 2′,3′-cGMP terminated UMP and 2′,3′-cGMP terminated CMP (UGp and CGp, respectively).
The cryo-EM structure of L7 TIR filaments in the end state revealed that the packing of the tetrameric TIR domains ( Figure 2 B, left) is similar to that in the initial and intermediate states ( Figure S4 A). Compared with the other two states, the end state displays less conformational heterogeneity, yielding the best resolution density ( Figure S2 H) that allowed us to build a detailed atomic model of the TIR domain ( Figures 4 B and S4 B). No clear density for dsDNA is present in the end state, suggesting that nucleic acid hydrolysis is complete ( Figure 4 C). There is an extra density blob inside the predicted NAD + -binding pocket of L7 TIR roughly the size of a single nucleotide ( Figure 4 C). Interestingly, the conformation of the BB-loop of L7 TIR is nearly identical to that of RUN1 TIR bound by NADP + and bis-Tris ( Figure S4 C). The quality of the density does not allow us to unambiguously determine the identity of the molecule bound in the pocket, but docking of nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives showed that a 2′,3′-cNMP (2′,3′-cAMP modeled) best fits the topology of the density ( Figure 4 D). The modeled 2′,3′-cAMP completely overlaps with bis-Tris bound in RUN1 TIR and is buried in that pocket ( Figures 4 D and S4 C). By comparison, the active sites of RNase T1 ( Ishikawa et al., 1996 27. Ishikawa, K. ∙ Suzuki, E. ∙ Tanokura, M. ... Crystal structure of ribonuclease T1 carboxymethylated at Glu58 in complex with 2′-GMP Biochemistry. 1996; 35 :8329-8334 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RNase MC1 ( Numata et al., 2003 48. Numata, T. ∙ Suzuki, A. ∙ Kakuta, Y. ... Crystal structures of the ribonuclease MC1 mutants N71T and N71S in complex with 5′-GMP: structural basis for alterations in substrate specificity Biochemistry. 2003; 42 :5270-5278 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) are largely solvent exposed, making it possible for them to bind an oligonucleotide for cyclization of the 3′-phosphate group ( Figure 4 E). The smaller size of the binding pocket of L7 TIR can only allow the binding of a mononucleotide for cyclization reaction.
Next, we asked whether the synthetase activity is required for TIR signaling. Although the conserved Cys132 was dispensable for the NADase and nuclease activity of L7 TIR ( Figure S1 F), the equivalent residue is important for the cell death activity of L6 TIR ( Bernoux et al., 2011 5. Bernoux, M. ∙ Ve, T. ∙ Williams, S. ... Structural and functional analysis of a plant resistance protein TIR domain reveals interfaces for self-association, signaling, and autoregulation Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 9 :200-211 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RPV1 TIR ( Williams et al., 2016 73. Williams, S.J. ∙ Yin, L. ∙ Foley, G. ... Structure and function of the TIR domain from the grape NLR protein RPV1 Front. Plant Sci. 2016; 7 :1850 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) in Nt . These results suggest that this conserved residue may be specifically important for the synthetase activity of TIRs. Indeed, C132A abrogated much of L7 TIR synthetase activity ( Figure S5 A). Similarly, RBA1 C83A greatly impaired the synthetase activity ( Figures 5 A and S5 B), but had no detectable effect on the NADase ( Figure 5 B) and a modest effect on the nuclease activity ( Figure S5 C) of RBA1. Like mutations of the equivalent residues of L6 TIR and RPV1 TIR , RBA1 C83A substantially suppressed the cell death activity of RBA1 in Nb ( Figure 5 C). Together, these results support an essential and conserved role of synthetase activity in TIR-mediated cell death, confirming the idea that nuclease activity is not sufficient for TIR-mediated cell death.
Like the mutation of basic residues in L7 TIR ( Figures 3 F–3H), a simultaneous mutation K122A/K123A/K130A (KKK AAA ) of the equivalent residues from αD in RBA1 nearly abrogated the synthetase ( Figures 5 A and S5 C) and nuclease ( Figure S5 B) activities, however, only slightly affected the NADase ( Figure 5 B) activity of RBA1. By contrast, the catalytic mutation E86A resulted in the loss of these three enzymatic activities of RBA1 ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S5 B, and S5C). We then employed RBA1 KKK AAA to further confirm whether the synthetase activity is important for TIR-mediated cell death. The cell death phenotype by RBA1 in Nb was completely suppressed by the catalytic E86A mutation ( Figures 5 B and 5C), further confirming an essential role for the NADase activity in TIR signaling. Importantly, the cell death phenotype was similarly suppressed by the KKK AAA mutation ( Figure 5 C). Together, these results support a critical and conserved role for the cluster of basic residues from αD in the cell death activity of TIRs.
We next investigated if TIR expression promotes the accumulation of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP in planta . Levels of these two non-canonical 2′,3′-cNMPs in RBA1 -expressing Nb plants were assayed by LC-MS. Expression of WT RBA1 , but not empty vector (EV) and catalytic mutant E86A, significantly enhanced accumulation of both 2′,3′-cAMP and 2′,3′-cGMP ( Figures 5 D and S5 D). Similarly, KKK AAA with reduced RBA1-mediated cell death also reduced the accumulation of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP. These results indicate that RBA1-mediated cell death in Nb is accompanied by increased 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP levels.
Ab TIR has NADase activity ( Essuman et al., 2018 18. Essuman, K. ∙ Summers, D.W. ∙ Sasaki, Y. ... TIR domain proteins are an ancient family of NAD + -consuming enzymes Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :421-430 e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) but fails to induce cell death when expressed in Nt ( Duxbury et al., 2020 16. Duxbury, Z. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ MacKenzie, C.I. ... Induced proximity of a TIR signaling domain on a plant-mammalian NLR chimera activates defense in plants Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :18832-18839 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cluster of basic residues conserved in plant TIRs is not conserved in Ab TIR ( Figure S1 E), suggesting that Ab TIR lacks synthetase activity. Indeed, while Ab TIR had comparable NADase activity to L7 TIR as previously reported ( Duxbury et al., 2020 16. Duxbury, Z. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ MacKenzie, C.I. ... Induced proximity of a TIR signaling domain on a plant-mammalian NLR chimera activates defense in plants Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :18832-18839 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), the bacterial TIR protein displayed no nuclease and synthetase activity ( Figures 5 E and S5 E). These results may explain why Ab TIR has no cell death activity in planta and provide additional evidence for a critical role of synthetase activity in TIR-mediated cell death.
Our results support a crucial role of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP in TIR-mediated cell death. Conceivably, the intracellular homeostasis of these noncanonical cNMPs has to be maintained in the absence of biotic or abiotic stress conditions. Although in vivo substrates of At NUDT6 and At NUDT7 remain unknown, the catalytic residue Glu154 is required for At NUDT7 inhibition of EDS1 signaling ( Ge et al., 2007 21. Ge, X. ∙ Li, G.J. ∙ Wang, S.B. ... At NUDT7, a negative regulator of basal immunity in Arabidopsis , modulates two distinct defense response pathways and is involved in maintaining redox homeostasis Plant Physiol. 2007; 145 :204-215 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized that At NUDT7 acts as a 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDE to negatively regulate EDS1-dependent signaling. HPLC analyses showed that purified At NUDT7 protein exhibited PDE activity toward 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP but not 3′,5′-cAMP/cGMP ( Figures 6 A, S6 A, and S6B). Furthermore, the substitution of the catalytic residue Glu154 with Gln abolished the PDE activity ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). These results demonstrate that At NUDT7 acts as a 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDE in vitro . Further supporting this conclusion, the At NUDT7 protein hydrolyzed 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP produced by L7 TIR but had no effect on L7 TIR -mediated degradation of At RNA ( Figures S6 A and S6C).
Next, we investigated if the 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDE activity is required for AtNUDT7 inhibition of EDS1 signaling. Supporting previous data ( Bartsch et al., 2006 3. Bartsch, M. ∙ Gobbato, E. ∙ Bednarek, P. ... Salicylic acid-independent enhanced disease susceptibility1 signaling in Arabidopsis immunity and cell death is regulated by the monooxygenase FMO1 and the Nudix hydrolase NUDT7 Plant Cell. 2006; 18 :1038-1051 Crossref Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ge et al., 2007 21. Ge, X. ∙ Li, G.J. ∙ Wang, S.B. ... At NUDT7, a negative regulator of basal immunity in Arabidopsis , modulates two distinct defense response pathways and is involved in maintaining redox homeostasis Plant Physiol. 2007; 145 :204-215 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ), Atnudt7 Arabidopsis plants exhibited a stunted growth phenotype ( Figure S6 D). Quantification with LC-MS showed that levels of both 2′,3′-cAMP ( Figure 6 B, left) and 2′,3′-cGMP ( Figure S6 E, left) were markedly elevated in the Atnudt7 plants as compared with those of WT plants, suggesting that the absence of At NUDT7 reduces hydrolysis of these cNMPs. Although not statistically significant, the levels of 2′, 3′-cAMP/cGMP in Atnudt7 eds1 double-mutant plants appear to be higher than those of WT plants ( Figures 6 B and S6 E), suggesting an EDS1-dependent and an EDS1-independent role in promoting the production of these cNMPs. These results support At NUDT7 as a 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDE in vivo and reinforce our conclusion that synthetase activity is required for TIR-mediated and EDS1-dependent signaling.
We next assessed the effect of AtNUDT7 on RBA1 -mediated cell death in Nb . Co-expression with AtNUDT7 strongly suppressed the cell death activity of RBA1 ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 F). This suppressing activity of AtNUDT7 was nearly abrogated by the catalytic mutation E154Q, indicating that At NUDT7 inhibition of RBA1-mediated cell death is dependent on 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDE activity. In support of this conclusion, 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP levels were significantly reduced in Nb expressing RBA1 and AtNUDT7 compared with Nb expressing RBA1 and EV ( Figures 6 B, right and S6 E, right). By contrast, co-expression with 3′,5′-cGMP-specific PDE9 ( Hanna et al., 2012 25. Hanna, C.B. ∙ Yao, S. ∙ Wu, X. ... Identification of phosphodiesterase 9A as a cyclic guanosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase in germinal vesicle oocytes: a proposed role in the resumption of meiosis Fertil. Steril. 2012; 98 :487-495.e1 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) had little effect on RBA1-mediated cell death ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 F). Taken together, these data indicate that At NUDT7 suppresses RBA1-mediated cell death by acting as a 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDE.
We then asked whether 2′,3′-cNMP PDEs can generally inhibit RBA1-mediated cell death. 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-PDE (CNPase) is an animal enzyme that hydrolyzes 2′,3′-cNMPs to their respective 2′-nucleotides ( Myllykoski et al., 2016 42. Myllykoski, M. ∙ Seidel, L. ∙ Muruganandam, G. ... Structural and functional evolution of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase Brain Res. 2016; 1641 :64-78 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). The enzymatic activity of mouse CNPase (mCNPase) was confirmed by HPLC ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). Like At NUDT7, mCNPase had no activity of hydrolyzing 3′,5′-cAMP/cGMP in vitro ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Co-expression with mCNPase in Nb greatly compromised RBA1-mediated cell death ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 F). Similar observations were made with an Arabidopsis 2′,3′-cyclic PDE ( At CPDase) ( Figures 6 A, 6C, 6D, S6 A, S6B, and S6F).
Our data above show that Nudix hydrolases can act as 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDEs to suppress EDS1 signaling. Nudix hydrolases are present in many pathogens ( Dong and Wang, 2016 15. Dong, S. ∙ Wang, Y. Nudix effectors: a common weapon in the arsenal of plant pathogens PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12 , e1005704 Google Scholar ) and some Nudix effectors like Xanthomonas euvesicatoria XopQ ( Adlung and Bonas, 2017 1. Adlung, N. ∙ Bonas, U. Dissecting virulence function from recognition: cell death suppression in Nicotiana benthamiana by XopQ/HopQ1-family effectors relies on EDS1-dependent immunity Plant J. Cell Mol. Biol. 2017; 91 :430-442 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Phytophthora sojae Avr3b ( Kong et al., 2015 32. Kong, G. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Jing, M. ... The activation of Phytophthora effector Avr3b by plant cyclophilin is required for the Nudix hydrolase activity of Avr3b PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 , e1005139 Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar ) are critical for pathogen virulence activity, suggesting that these two effectors may have 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDE activity. Assays by HPLC showed that purified XopQ and Avr3b displayed activity to hydrolyze 2′,3′- but not 3′,5′-cAMP/cGMP ( Figures 6 A, S6 A, and S6B). Furthermore, co-expression with Avr3b compromised RBA1-mediated cell death in Nb ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 F). A similar experiment was not performed for XopQ because the effector is recognized by the endogenous Nb TNL Roq1 ( Schultink et al., 2017 59. Schultink, A. ∙ Qi, T. ∙ Lee, A. ... Roq1 mediates recognition of the Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas effector proteins XopQ and HopQ1 Plant J. 2017; 92 :787-795 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, these results support pathogen-mediated negative regulation of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP-induced signaling by PDEs. The metabolization of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP by XopQ also provides an explanation for XopQ-mediated inhibition of EDS1-dependent cell death in Nicotiana species ( Adlung and Bonas, 2017 1. Adlung, N. ∙ Bonas, U. Dissecting virulence function from recognition: cell death suppression in Nicotiana benthamiana by XopQ/HopQ1-family effectors relies on EDS1-dependent immunity Plant J. Cell Mol. Biol. 2017; 91 :430-442 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Next, we asked whether upregulation of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP promotes RBA1 cell death activity. Treatment of Nb plants with 8-Br-2′,3′-cAMP, a cell-permeable analog of 2′,3′-cAMP, had no effect on the cell death activity of RBA1, likely because the analog is unable to mimic all functions of 2′,3′-cAMP in plants and/or both 2′,3′-cAMP and 2′,3′-cGMP are needed to promote RBA1 signaling. We then tested if HopBA1-induced cell death in Arabidopsis Ag-0 is accompanied by increased levels of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP. Supporting a previous study, delivery of HopBA1 by Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 in leaves induced visible cell death in Arabidopsis Ag-0 48 h post infection (hpi) ( Figure S7 A). 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP levels in these plants were higher than those in EV carrying Pf0-1 infiltrated plants ( Figure 7 A). Together with previous data ( Nishimura et al., 2017 47. Nishimura, M.T. ∙ Anderson, R.G. ∙ Cherkis, K.A. ... TIR-only protein RBA1 recognizes a pathogen effector to regulate cell death in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2053-E2062 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), these results indicate a positive correlation between 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP levels and RBA1-mediated immune signaling.
Our results suggest that the production of 2′,3′-cNMPs by TIRs is upstream of EDS1. Unexpectedly, however, expression of RBA1 in eds1 mutants of Nb induced no pronounced accumulation of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP ( Figure S7 B). This is consistent with the observation that 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP levels in Atnudt7 eds1 plants were comparable with those of WT Arabidopsis ( Figures 6 B and S6 E). However, downregulation of these two cNMPs by 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDEs greatly compromised EDS1-dependent immune signaling in Nb ( Figures 6 C and 6D). A model reconciling these data is positive feedback between TIR-catalyzed 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP and EDS1, which is negatively regulated by 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDEs ( Figure 7 B). The model agrees with the observation that the strength of TIR-mediated HR-like cell death is strongly correlated with protein levels ( Zhang et al., 2004 81. Zhang, Y. ∙ Dorey, S. ∙ Swiderski, M. ... Expression of RPS4 in tobacco induces an AvrRps4-independent HR that requires EDS1, SGT1 and HSP90 Plant J. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 40 :213-224 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since TIR signaling is activated during PTI ( Pruitt et al., 2021 52. Pruitt, R.N. ∙ Gust, A.A. ∙ Nürnberger, T. Plant immunity unified Nat. Plants. 2021; 7 :382-383 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roth et al., 2017 57. Roth, C. ∙ Ludke, D. ∙ Klenke, M. ...

Activation of TIR signalling boosts pattern-triggered immunity Nature. 2021; 598 :500-503 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ), this model may also explain why PTI activation potentiates HR cell death in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing AvrRps4 ( Ngou et al., 2020 45. Ngou, B.P.M. ∙ Ahn, H.K. ∙ Ding, P. ... Estradiol-inducible AvrRps4 expression reveals distinct properties of TIR-NLR-mediated effector-triggered immunity J. Exp. Bot. 2020; 71 :2186-2197 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) and flg22 enhances HR-like cell death mediated by At TN3 in Nb ( Nandety et al., 2013 43. Nandety, R.S. ∙ Caplan, J.L. ∙ Cavanaugh, K. ... The role of TIR-NBS and TIR-X proteins in plant basal defense responses Plant Physiol. 2013; 162 :1459-1472 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP-promoted EDS1 signaling appears to involve a self-amplification mechanism.

Section: Discussion

Enzymes engaging in the specific production of 2′,3′-cNMPs remained unidentified. Here, we provide evidence that plant TIR proteins are bifunctional enzymes with both NADase and synthetase activity. TIR mutants lacking either enzymatic activity lost their cell death activity, indicating that the dual enzymatic activity is important for TIR function. Furthermore, downregulation of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP levels by 2′,3′-cyclic PDEs from different origins suppressed TIR-mediated cell death; conversely, upregulation of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP in Atnudt7 plants or the delivery of HopBA1 into RBA1-containing host cells was associated with cell death. These results collectively support an important role for the synthetase activity in TIR-mediated immune signaling. This study not only identified an enzyme family for the production of 2′,3′-cNMPs but also established an essential role for them in mediating EDS1-dependent signaling.
Both DNA and RNA were hydrolyzed by TIR proteins to produce 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP in vitro , but whether DNA, RNA, or both are substrates of TIR synthetases remains unknown. In vitro , RNA appears to be a much more favorable substrate. It is rather surprising that DNA acts as a substrate for 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP production since it does not have a 2′-hydroxyl group. The mechanism of TIR-catalyzed 2′,3′-cNMPs remains undefined, but our data ( Figures 4 B, S1 F, and S5 A) suggest a two-step mechanism for their production: RNA/DNA cleavage could result in the flipping and binding of a nucleotide to the catalytic site of TIRs for the cyclization reaction. Consistently, a patch of density in the catalytic pocket of the intermediate state appears to come from a flipped nucleotide ( Figure S2 K). This model would explain why ATP and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) were not substrates of TIRs to produce 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP ( Figure S7 C). Thus, plant TIRs are different from human DNase/RNase endonuclease G that directly cleaves RNA/DNA for apoptotic cell death ( Cregan et al., 2004 13. Cregan, S.P. ∙ Dawson, V.L. ∙ Slack, R.S. Role of AIF in caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death Oncogene. 2004; 23 :2785-2796 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we cannot exclude a role of TIR nuclease activity in other processes than plant cell death.
In contrast to canonical bifunctional enzymes that generally harbor two structural domains with separate catalytic sites ( Moore, 2004 41. Moore, Bd. Bifunctional and moonlighting enzymes: lighting the way to regulatory control Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9 :221-228 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), the dual enzymatic activity of TIR proteins is encoded by the same structural domain. TIRs form different oligomers for their NADase and synthetase activities ( Figures 2 B and 2D). In addition to the AE and DE interfaces, RNA/DNA substrates clearly have an important role in forming TIR oligomers for synthetase activity, because mutations predicted to disrupt DNA binding activity resulted in the loss of the enzymatic activity ( Figures 3 D and 3E).
The formation of the L7 TIR -dsDNA complex is mediated by both AE and DE interfaces ( Figure 2 B), revealing the mechanism underlying the simultaneous requirement of the two interfaces for TIR functions ( Nishimura et al., 2017 47. Nishimura, M.T. ∙ Anderson, R.G. ∙ Cherkis, K.A. ... TIR-only protein RBA1 recognizes a pathogen effector to regulate cell death in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2053-E2062 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ; Williams et al., 2016 73. Williams, S.J. ∙ Yin, L. ∙ Foley, G. ... Structure and function of the TIR domain from the grape NLR protein RPV1 Front. Plant Sci. 2016; 7 :1850 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 80. Zhang, X. ∙ Bernoux, M. ∙ Bentham, A.R. ... Multiple functional self-association interfaces in plant TIR domains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2046-E2052 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the AE interface is highly conserved among TIRs, variations exist in the DE interface. These variations, as seen in the crystal structure of RPP1 TIR , allow no propagation of the DE and AE interfaces to form a filament-like structure ( Zhang et al., 2017 80. Zhang, X. ∙ Bernoux, M. ∙ Bentham, A.R. ... Multiple functional self-association interfaces in plant TIR domains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2046-E2052 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the RPP1 TIR protein was active in producing 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP albeit with lower activity ( Figure S7 D), suggesting that filament formation is not absolutely required for the synthetase activity. This can be explained by the observation that a L7 TIR tetramer mediated by the AE and DE interfaces is sufficient for binding one complete turn of dsDNA/dsRNA ( Figure 3 A). The tetramer is incompatible with the tetrameric TIR that is important for the NADase activity ( Ma et al., 2020 36. Ma, S. ∙ Lapin, D. ∙ Liu, L. ... Direct pathogen-induced assembly of an NLR immune receptor complex to form a holoenzyme Science. 2020; 370 , eabe3069 Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar ; Martin et al., 2020 38. Martin, R. ∙ Qi, T. ∙ Zhang, H. ... Structure of the activated ROQ1 resistosome directly recognizing the pathogen effector XopQ Science. 2020; 370 , eabd9993 Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar ), suggesting that synthetase and NADase activity are exclusive in a given oligomeric TIR. Consistent with this conclusion, the L7 TIR -dsDNA complex had little NADase activity ( Figure 2 D). NADase activity of TIR domain proteins from different kingdoms has been demonstrated ( Essuman et al., 2018 18. Essuman, K. ∙ Summers, D.W. ∙ Sasaki, Y. ...

Ofir, G. ∙ Herbst, E. ∙ Baroz, M. ... Antiviral activity of bacterial TIR domains via immune signalling molecules Nature. 2021; 600 :116-120 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data with Ab TIR could be a hint that TIR synthetase activity did not evolve universally in all kingdoms.
Both synthetase and NADase activities are essential for RBA1-mediated HR cell death in Nb but whether and how the two activities interact remain unknown. Triggering initiation of TIR immune signaling may require the dual enzymatic activity. Once initiated, TIR signaling can promote the production of 2′,3′-cNMPs, which in turn further amplify TIR signaling. Initiation of EDS1 signaling may cause alterations, for example, in structures and/or stability of DNA/RNA, which allow a TIR protein to access the otherwise poor substrates. This model agrees with the observations that some TNLs require nuclear localization ( Wirthmueller et al., 2007 74. Wirthmueller, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Jones, J.D. ... Nuclear accumulation of the Arabidopsis immune receptor RPS4 is necessary for triggering EDS1-dependent defense Curr. Biol. 2007; 17 :2023-2029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2010 83. Zhu, Y. ∙ Qian, W. ∙ Hua, J. Temperature modulates plant defense responses through NB-LRR proteins PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6 , e1000844 Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar ) for function and NLR activation induces EDS1-dependent DNA damage ( Rodriguez et al., 2018 56. Rodriguez, E. ∙ Chevalier, J. ∙ El Ghoul, H. ... DNA damage as a consequence of NLR activation PLoS Genet. 2018; 14 , e1007235 Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar ). Furthermore, cytosolic or membrane localization has been reported for other TIRs ( Nandety et al., 2013 43. Nandety, R.S. ∙ Caplan, J.L. ∙ Cavanaugh, K. ... The role of TIR-NBS and TIR-X proteins in plant basal defense responses Plant Physiol. 2013; 162 :1459-1472 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roth et al., 2017 57. Roth, C. ∙ Ludke, D. ∙ Klenke, M. ... The truncated NLR protein TIR-NBS13 is a MOS6/IMPORTIN-alpha3 interaction partner required for plant immunity Plant J. Cell Mol. Biol. 2017; 92 :808-821 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nishimura et al., 2017 47. Nishimura, M.T. ∙ Anderson, R.G. ∙ Cherkis, K.A. ... TIR-only protein RBA1 recognizes a pathogen effector to regulate cell death in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2053-E2062 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, different cellular localization may enable TIRs to guard the integrity of RNA/DNA. This would provide an explanation of how TIR-only proteins sense the presence of pathogen effectors despite the lack of the pathogen-sensing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) as demonstrated in both CNLs and TNLs ( Ma et al., 2020 36. Ma, S. ∙ Lapin, D. ∙ Liu, L. ... Direct pathogen-induced assembly of an NLR immune receptor complex to form a holoenzyme Science. 2020; 370 , eabe3069 Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar ; Martin et al., 2020 38. Martin, R. ∙ Qi, T. ∙ Zhang, H. ... Structure of the activated ROQ1 resistosome directly recognizing the pathogen effector XopQ Science. 2020; 370 , eabd9993 Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar ). Clearly, more studies, including the identification of predicted 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP receptors, are needed to unveil the signaling mechanism of these noncanonical cNMPs. These studies may also aid to determine whether these cNMPs act as second messengers or not.
Although several small molecules were shown to be substrates of At NUDT7 in vitro , changes in their levels were not detected in Atnudt7 mutant plants ( Ge et al., 2007 21. Ge, X. ∙ Li, G.J. ∙ Wang, S.B. ... At NUDT7, a negative regulator of basal immunity in Arabidopsis , modulates two distinct defense response pathways and is involved in maintaining redox homeostasis Plant Physiol. 2007; 145 :204-215 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accumulation of 2′,3′-cAMP ( Figure 6 B, left) and 2′,3′-cGMP ( Figure S6 E, left) were strongly enhanced in Atnudt7 leaves, supporting the role of these two cNMPs in immune signaling. However, the phenotypes of Atnudt7-1 plants are largely abolished under conditions of reduced stress ( Straus et al., 2010 61. Straus, M.R. ∙ Rietz, S. ∙ Ver Loren van Themaat, E. ... Salicylic acid antagonism of EDS1-driven cell death is important for immune and oxidative stress responses in Arabidopsis Plant J. 2010; 62 :628-640 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that 2′,3′-cNMPs alone are insufficient for EDS1 activation. This is consistent with the idea that both 2′,3′-cNMP synthetase and NADase activities are required for TIR-mediated signaling. Notably, the Nudix effector XopQ and Avr3b also exhibited 2′,3′- but not 3′,5′-cAMP/cGMP PDE activity in vitro , with the latter effector suppressing RBA1-mediated cell death in Nb ( Figures 6 C and 6D). These results suggest that pathogens have evolved strategies for targeting 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP-induced signaling to defeat plant immunity.
Nudix hydrolases belong to a highly conserved family of enzymes across all organisms and have broad substrate specificities ( McLennan, 2006 39. McLennan, A.G. The Nudix hydrolase superfamily Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63 :123-143 Crossref Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our finding that At NUDT7, XopQ, and Avr3b act as 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDEs opens opportunities for investigations of this enzyme family and the two noncanonical cNMPs beyond plants. In addition to Nudix hydrolases, plant 2′,3′-AMP/cGMP PDEs were also found in Triticum aestivum germ and shown to possess the ability to hydrolyze 2′,3′-cNMPs into 2′-NMPs ( Tyc et al., 1987 66. Tyc, K. ∙ Kellenberger, C. ∙ Filipowicz, W. Purification and characterization of wheat germ 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262 :12994-13000 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two homologs of this group of PDEs are present in Arabidopsis . Biochemical data showed that At 4g18930 has similar enzymatic activity ( Genschik et al., 1997 22. Genschik, P. ∙ Hall, J. ∙ Filipowicz, W. Cloning and characterization of the Arabidopsis cyclic phosphodiesterase which hydrolyzes ADP-ribose 1′′,2′′-cyclic phosphate and nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 :13211-13219 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). It will be of interest to know whether these non-Nudix 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDEs have a role in regulating EDS1-dependent signaling. Given the diversity of TIR and Nudix hydrolase-encoding gene families in plant genomes, the accumulation of these non-canonical cNMPs might be differentially regulated in other plant organs and tissues.
The accumulation of RBA1 is induced by HopBA1 and broadly correlated with HR cell death triggered by canonical NLRs ( Nishimura et al., 2017 47. Nishimura, M.T. ∙ Anderson, R.G. ∙ Cherkis, K.A. ... TIR-only protein RBA1 recognizes a pathogen effector to regulate cell death in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2053-E2062 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), including the role of RBA1 in immune signaling mediated by the CNL ZAR1 ( Martel et al., 2020 37. Martel, A. ∙ Laflamme, B. ∙ Seto, D. ... Immunodiversity of the Arabidopsis ZAR1 NLR is conveyed by receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase sensors Front. Plant Sci. 2020; 11 :1290 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with a contribution of TIRs in CNL-mediated ETI, more recent data revealed a direct functional link between At TN13 and RPS5 in Arabidopsis ( Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, H. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Rui, L. ... The TIR-NBS protein TN13 associates with the CC-NBS-LRR resistance protein RPS5 and contributes to RPS5-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis Plant J. 2021; 107 :775-786 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results agree with gene expression profiling analysis revealing biotic stress-induced expression of TIR-only and TN genes ( Nandety et al., 2013 43. Nandety, R.S. ∙ Caplan, J.L. ∙ Cavanaugh, K. ... The role of TIR-NBS and TIR-X proteins in plant basal defense responses Plant Physiol. 2013; 162 :1459-1472 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to ETI, accumulating evidence supports the role of TIR signaling in PTI responses ( Pruitt et al., 2021 52. Pruitt, R.N. ∙ Gust, A.A. ∙ Nürnberger, T. Plant immunity unified Nat. Plants. 2021; 7 :382-383 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roth et al., 2017 57. Roth, C. ∙ Ludke, D. ∙ Klenke, M. ...

Activation of TIR signalling boosts pattern-triggered immunity Nature. 2021; 598 :500-503 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, EDS1-dependent signaling is required for basal resistance to virulent pathogens ( Bonardi et al., 2011 8. Bonardi, V. ∙ Tang, S. ∙ Stallmann, A. ... Expanded functions for a family of plant intracellular immune receptors beyond specific recognition of pathogen effectors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :16463-16468 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rietz et al., 2011 55. Rietz, S. ∙ Stamm, A. ∙ Malonek, S. ...

These results suggest a broad role for TIR signaling in ETI and PTI responses. The role of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP in plant abiotic stresses was supported by recent data ( Van Damme et al., 2014 67. Van Damme, T. ∙ Blancquaert, D. ∙ Couturon, P. ... Wounding stress causes rapid increase in concentration of the naturally occurring 2′,3′-isomers of cyclic guanosine- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cGMP and cAMP) in plant tissues Phytochemistry. 2014; 103 :59-66 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kosmacz et al., 2018 33. Kosmacz, M. ∙ Luzarowski, M. ∙ Kerber, O. ... Interaction of 2′,3′-cAMP with Rbp47b plays a role in stress granule formation Plant Physiol. 2018; 177 :411-421 PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, 2′,3′-cAMP mediates SG formation ( Kosmacz et al., 2018 33. Kosmacz, M. ∙ Luzarowski, M. ∙ Kerber, O. ... Interaction of 2′,3′-cAMP with Rbp47b plays a role in stress granule formation Plant Physiol. 2018; 177 :411-421 PubMed Google Scholar ), which mimics the abiotic response in Arabidopsis ( Chodasiewicz et al., 2022 11. Chodasiewicz, M. ∙ Kerber, O. ∙ Gorka, M. ... 2′,3′-cAMP treatment mimics abiotic stress response Plant Physiol. 2022; 188 :1966-1978 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, AtNUDT7 is one of the most induced genes in response to 2′,3′-cAMP ( Chodasiewicz et al., 2022 11. Chodasiewicz, M. ∙ Kerber, O. ∙ Gorka, M. ... 2′,3′-cAMP treatment mimics abiotic stress response Plant Physiol. 2022; 188 :1966-1978 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). AtNUDT7 transcripts are responsive to numerous abiotic and biotic stress conditions ( Straus et al., 2010 61. Straus, M.R. ∙ Rietz, S. ∙ Ver Loren van Themaat, E. ... Salicylic acid antagonism of EDS1-driven cell death is important for immune and oxidative stress responses in Arabidopsis Plant J. 2010; 62 :628-640 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a broad role for AtNUDT7 and possibly 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP in the regulation of plant stress responses. However, it remains unknown whether TIR signaling is directly involved in abiotic stress responses induced by 2′,3′-cAMP in plants. Future investigations are needed to determine whether and how 2′,3′-cNMPs are involved in the interplay between PTI and ETI, TNL- and CNL-triggered, and abiotic/biotic stress responses. Answering these questions may provide new signaling paradigms for stress biology.
In this study, we show that plant TIR proteins act as synthetases with RNA/DNA serving as substrates and provide evidence for the role of the two noncanonical cNMPs in TIR-mediated cell death. Thus, TIR proteins are bifunctional enzymes with NADase and 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetase activities. We propose that products such as the previously identified v-cADPR from the NADase activity and 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP act cooperatively to trigger the initiation of TIR-dependent immune signaling, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the future, identification and characterization of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP targets will reveal whether the two mutually exclusive TIR enzyme activities converge on the same or act on different host targets. Finally, chemical synthesis of the cell-permeable prodrug analogs that can be hydrolyzed to 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP in plant cells will be useful to provide further evidence for their biological function and to explore a broader role of these cNMPs in plant stress biology.

Bacteria strain Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was used in this work for protein purification. Bacteria were cultured in LB medium (CarlRoth) at 37°C until OD 600 reached 0.6, protein expression was induced by addition of 0.8 mM Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 18°C for 16 h with 180 rpm in shaking incubator (MaxQ 6000, Thermo Scientific).
Insect cell strain Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) was used in this work for protein purification. Cells were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Gibco) at 28°C with 120 rpm in shaking incubator (Innova 44, Eppendorf). Baculovirus infected cells were cultured at 28°C with 120 rpm for 48 h.
Arabidopsis thaliana accession Ag-0, Col-0 and Nicotiana benthamiana were used in this work. The N. benthamiana quadruple mutant epss ( eds1, pad4, sag101a, sag101b ) , Arabidopsis single mutant Atnudt7 and double mutant Atnudt7 eds1 were described previously ( Lapin et al.,2019 35. Lapin, D. ∙ Kovacova, V. ∙ Sun, X. ... A coevolved EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 module mediates cell death signaling by TIR-domain immune receptors Plant Cell. 2019; 31 :2430-2455 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Straus et al., 2010 61. Straus, M.R. ∙ Rietz, S. ∙ Ver Loren van Themaat, E. ... Salicylic acid antagonism of EDS1-driven cell death is important for immune and oxidative stress responses in Arabidopsis Plant J. 2010; 62 :628-640 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). All plants were grown on soil in walk-in growth chambers, the greenhouse, the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne.
TX0 ( At 1g57630, residues 1-172) was cloned into pMAL C2X vector and expressed in E. coli as MBP-fusion protein with an additional C-terminal GST tag, TX7 ( At 1g57850, residues 1-192), Ab TIR (residues 1-269), L6 TIR (residues 26-231) and L7 TIR (residues 26-231) were cloned into pMAL C2X vector and expressed in E. coli as MBP-fusion proteins with additional C-terminal 6 × His tags. The constructs were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) at 42°C with 90 s heat shock and the cell cultures were grown at 37°C to OD 600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG, Sigma) was added to induce protein expression at 18°C for 16 h. The E. coli cells were harvested and lysed by sonification in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 15 mM imidazole. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 1.5 h. The supernatant containing soluble proteins was collected and allowed to flow through Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare). After washing with three column volumes of sonification buffer, the fusion proteins were eluted in the buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 150 mM imidazole. For TX0 and TX7, tags could not be completely removed by PreScission protease. Arabidopsis NUDT7 (residues 1-322), NUDT7 E154Q (residues 1-322), Phytophthora sojae Avr3b p6497 (residues 19-314), Xanthomonas euvesicatoria XopQ (residues 85-465), mouse CNPase1 (mCNPase1, residues 161-380) and Arabidopsis CPDase (AtCPDase, residues 1-181) were cloned into pGEX6p-1 vector and expressed in E. coli as N-terminal GST-fused proteins. The same protocol as described above was used for E. coli culturing. The E. coli cells were harvested and lysed by sonification in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 1.5 h. The supernatant containing soluble proteins were collected and allowed to flow through GST4B resin (GE Healthcare). After washing with three column volumes of sonification buffer, the fusion proteins were incubated with PreScission at 4°C overnight to remove the N-terminal GST tag and the digested proteins flowed through the columns in the buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl. WT RBA1 (residues 1-363) and RBA1 mutant proteins were cloned into the pFastBac 1 vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal SUMO-6×His tag. The constructs were used for generating recombinant baculovirus in Sf21 insect cells (Invitrogen). RBA1 and RBA1 mutant proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect cells with recombinant baculovirus infection at 28 °C for 48 h. The infected cells were harvested and lysed by sonification in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 15 mM imidazole. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 1.5 h. The supernatant containing soluble proteins were collected and allowed to flow through Ni-NTA resin. After washing with three column volumes of sonification buffer, the fusion proteins were incubated with PreScission protease at 4°C overnight to remove the N-terminal SUMO-6×His tag and the digested proteins flowed through the columns in the buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl.
Purified WT and mutant L7 TIR proteins (20 μM), Ab TIR (20 μM), WT RBA1 and mutant proteins (10 μM) were used for NADase assays. Proteins were individually incubated with 100 μM NAD + (final concentration) and 10 mM MgCl 2 in buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The total volume for each reaction was 100 μl. Reactions were performed in a thermoshaker (CellMedia) at 25°C for 16 h. After reaction, samples were centrifuged and immediately applied for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.
HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1260 bioinert HPLC system using a Synergi Fusion-RP 80 Å (4.6 × 150 mm, 4 μm) (Phenomenex) column. The samples were measured via an 8-min method. Samples (10 μl) were injected at 550 μl/min with ammonium formate (5 mM) in water and methanol used as mobile phases A and B, respectively. The elution profile was as follows: 0 to 3 min, 10 to 70% B; 3 to 6 min, 70% B; 6 to 6.1 min, 70 to 10% B; 6.1 to 8 min, 10% B. The autosampler temperature was maintained at 4°C and the column temperature at 25°C. UV signals were detected at 260 nm. Reference standards were used to determine respective retention times. The integrations of peak area were used to calculate relative concentrations.
At NUDT7 E154Q construct was introduced using overlap extension PCR. All other mutations of the constructs used for in vitro and in vivo assays were introduced using a Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Arabidopsis genomic DNA, Arabidopsis total RNA, PCR product and plasmid (100 ng for each) were individually incubated with purified RBA1 and RBA1 mutant proteins (200 nM for each), TX0, TX7, Ab TIR, L7 TIR and L7 TIR mutant proteins (1 μM for each) in the buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl at 25°C for 16 h if not mentioned otherwise. After reaction, the products were mixed with DNA loading buffer and visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Reaction products were visualized 6 h after reaction when RNA was used as substrate.
Nuclease activity was further measured by DNase I Assay Kit (Fluorometric, Abcam) with a fluorescent DNA probe as the substrate. The purified TIR proteins (5 μM) individually were incubated with the fluorescent DNA probe (25 μM, Abcam). The samples were measured by microplate reader SynergyH1 (BioTek) with excitation/emission 646/686 nm fluorescence.
Purified At NUDT7, At NUDT7 E154Q , Avr3b, XopQ, mCNPase and At CPDase (2 μM for each) were used for 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP PDE assay. Proteins were individually incubated with 100 μM 2′,3′-cAMP, 2′,3′-cAMP cGMP, 3′,5′-cAMP or 3′,5′-cGMP (final concentration) and 10 mM MgCl 2 in buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The total volume for each reaction was 50 μl. Reactions were performed in a thermoshaker (CellMedia) at 25°C for 16 h. After reaction, samples were centrifuged and immediately applied for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.
The purified RBA1 and RBA1 mutant proteins (5 μM for each), TX0, TX7 Ab TIR, L7 TIR and L7 TIR mutant proteins (1 μM for each) were incubated with 100 ng Arabidopsis genomic DNA or Arabidopsis total RNA in the buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. 2.5 μL of RNase T1 (Thermo Scientific) or DNase I (Jena Bioscience) was incubated with 100 ng Arabidopsis total RNA or gDNA. The total volume for each reaction was 100 μl. After incubation at 25°C for 16 h, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied to LC-MS/MS for metabolite identification and quantification.
For quality examination and overall structure analysis, TX0, RBA1, L6 TIR , L7 TIR and MBP tagged L7 TIR were subjected to Superose 6 10/300 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Fractions eluted at void volume were collected. 3 μl of each protein (0.1mg/ml) was applied to formvar carbon grids glow-discharged for 45 s at high level in Harrick Plasma after 2 min evacuation. The sample stayed on grid for 1 min at room temperature and dried by touching the edge of a filter paper. 3 μl 2% uranyl acetate was then applied to the grid for 45 s. The excess stain was removed. Grids were dried at room temperature for 2 min. Samples were imaged using Hitachi H-7650 120 kV transmission electron microscope (TEM) and images were recorded with an AMT XR-41 camera.
For structure determination, MBP tagged L7 TIR was incubated with PreScission protease at 4°C or 22°C for 12 h to remove the MBP tag. The L7 TIR protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using Superose6 10/300 gel filtration column in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl. 2.5 μl L7 TIR protein (1mg/ml) was applied to holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Cu 1.2/1.3, 300 mesh) glow-discharged for 30 s at high level in Harrick Plasma after 2 min evacuation. Grids were then blotted on filter paper (Ted Pella Inc.) for 3 s at 4°C with 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using FEI Vitrobot Marked IV. Several other conditions were tested with the hope to capture intermediate states, MBP-L7 TIR samples were cleaved by PreScission protease at room temperature (22°C) for 4 h, then further purified and blotted following similar protocol.
Two datasets of the L7 TIR filaments were collected: 4°C processed dataset on a Titan Krios2 electron microscope operated at 300 kV, equipped with Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector and a Gatan Quantum energy filter, and the 22°C processed dataset on Titan Krios2 with Gatan K3 detector later on.
Processing of the cryo-EM data followed a previous workflow used for reconstructing thin flexible helical complexes ( Gong et al., 2021 23. Gong, Q. ∙ Robinson, K. ∙ Xu, C. ... Structural basis for distinct inflammasome complex assembly by human NLRP1 and CARD8 Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :188 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Firstly, Motion Correction and CTF determination were carried out using corresponding modules in RELION. An in-house picking script designed specifically for filament picking was then used to select end-to-end filament coordinates ( https://github.com/Alexu0/Cryo-EM-filament-picker ). After segment extraction, coordinates and raw images were imported to cryoSPARC for binned 2D classification. Then selected particle coordinates were transferred back to RELION for helical 2D and 3D classification, 3D helical refinement, and final refinement and masked polishing.
In preliminary non-helical 2D analysis, 150 Å appeared to be the basic repeat unit of the physical rise after rotating the filament by either 180° or 360°. In addition, it appeared that there was a smaller helical unit around 35 Å. Then we exhausted and tested all the potential combinations of helical parameters that fit with these two observations. The preliminary helical parameter hits emerged to be +/-43°, and 34 Å. After iterative 3D classification and optimization, it turned out that the initial state Complex had helical parameters of 159.2°, 16.56 Å (mathematically equivalent to -41.6°, 33.12 Å). The intermediate state complex was -48.6°, 33.51 Å. The end state complex was -49.3°, 33.43 Å. Based on Gold Standard FSC = 0.143 measurement, the initial complex, intermediate complex and the end state complex maps were refined to the resolution of 3.4 Å, 3.5 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively.
Previous TIR domain crystal structure was used as initial model. Model refinement was achieved by fitting PDB 6O0W into a single TIR domain density of the end state complex (PDB code: 7VU8 ). Phenix real space refinement module was used to optimize the model fitting. Final model to density FSC (0.143) = 2.95 Å, while mask to density CC values (CC-mask, volume, peak, box) were within the range of 0.718 to 0.791. An extra blob of density was identified inside the nucleotide binding pocket. Extensive small molecule docking identified 2′,3′-cAMP as the best fit to accommodate this extra density. 16 refined L7 TIR models were docked into initial state complex, and the remaining dsDNA like density was fitted with 43 bp A-form dsDNA (PDB code: 7X5K ), model generated by Chimera. For every 11bp DNA, there was 2-3 base pairs found to be stretched, and possessing high slide and twist values, after Phenix real space optimization of the model fitting. This 43bp-16 TIR model was used to analyze how TIR domains oligomerize and cooperatively recognize nucleic acids. From several intermediate state complex structures, one representative density, which showed all double stranded region hydrolyzed down to 3 remaining base pair, was selected for model building. Using Coot and Chimera, nucleotides were manually added in to best represent the density. A detailed four L7 TIR model with the bound nucleic acids was built (PDB code: 7X5L ), with the aim of analyzing the nucleic acid-TIR interface during the progressive hydrolysis.
Two L7 TIR models together, with the bound single stranded DNA, was docked into the end state complex map to determine the complex conformation at the end of nucleic acid hydrolysis (PDB code: 7X5M ). Nucleotides were manually docked in, using Coot and Chimeraand later optimized using Phenix real space refinement. This model highlighted additional TIR-TIR interactions and how the residual single stranded nucleic acids remaining associated with TIR after many nucleotides were cleaved and removed. At this conformation, the 2′,3′-cNMP density inside the TIR domain was most obvious among all complexes.
For N. benthamiana transient expression, RBA1 (residues 1-363), AtNUDT7 (residues 1-322), PDE9 (residues 1-533), mCNPase1 (residues 161-380), AtCPDase (residues 1-181), Avr3b (residues 19-314), were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K240020). The obtained pENTR/D-TOPO RBA1 and RBA1 mutant plasmids were LR-recombined into pXCSG vectors with a C-terminal MYC tag. AtNUDT7 and PDE9 were cloned into pEGAD vectors with a C-terminal GFP tag by ligation and the obtained pENTR/D-TOPO mCNPase1 , AtCPDase , Avr3b plasmids were LR-recombined into pXCSG vectors with a C-terminal 3×HA tag. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Generated constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Rhizobium radiobacter) GV3101 pMP90RK via electroporation.
RBA1 and RBA1 mutants were expressed in leaves of four weeks old N. benthamiana plants using agrobacteria -mediated transient expression assays in the presence of the P19 suppressor of RNAi silencing. The final OD 600 for each strain was set to 0.8. For co-infiltration, agrobacteria carrying TIR and hydrolases expression constructs were mixed at 1:1 ratio. TIRs mixed with the EV were applied as a negative control to rule out the possibility that high titer of agrobacteria would affect infection efficiency. To detect RBA1, RBA1 mutants and the co-infiltrated At NUDT7, At NUDT7 E154Q and PDE9 protein expression, N. benthamiana leaves were collected at 2 dpi, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to fine powder. The powder (∼100 μl in a tube) was resuspended in 100 μl of urea-SDS sample buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 8 M urea, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and 0.004% Bromophenol Blue] and vortexed for 10 min at room temperature. No boiling step was included. After centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min, 10 μl of the supernatant was loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE and proteins were blotted onto a PVDF membrane.
To detect co-infiltrated mCNPase, At CPDase and Avr3b proteins expression, 300 mg N. benthamiana leaves were collected at 2 dpi and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All further steps were performed at 4°C if not mentioned otherwise. Tissue samples were ground to fine powder and resuspended in 1 ml of IP buffer [100mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton, 2% (w/v) PVPP, 10mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) 2% (v/v), protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 0.5 mM PMSF] and incubated for 1 h with gentle rotation. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 21,000 g for 15 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 5 μl rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Abcam 9110) coupled to 50 μl bed volume Protein A agarose (Roche) per sample. After 4 h of incubation under constant rotation, beads were washed 5 times in 1 mL IP buffer (without PVPP) and eluted by boiling in 100 μL of 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at 95°C. 10 μl was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and proteins were blotted onto a PVDF membrane.
Immunoblot assays were performed using monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody (Sigma Aldrich, 11867423001), mouse anti-Myc antibody (ThermoScientific R950-25), and rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Chromtek.pabg1-100) diluted 1:3000 in 1× TBS, 0.1% Tween-20 with 5% non-fat milk powder. Proteins were detected with a Gel Doc XR+ Gel Documentation System by using ECL SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate and ECL Western Blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific) in a ratio of 2:1.
RBA1 and RBA1 mutants and combinations with 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP hydrolase AtNUDT7 , PDE9 , mCNPase , AtCPDase and Avr3b were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana as described above and three individual agrobacteria -infiltrated leaf zones were used for electrolyte leakage assays. Five 8-mm leaf discs from N. benthamiana agroinfiltrated leaves were taken at 3 dpi, washed in 10 to 20 mL of milliQ water (18.2 MΩ ∗ cm, mQ) for 30 to 60 min, transferred to a 24-well plate with 1 mL mQ in each well, and incubated at room temperature. Electrolyte leakage was measured at 0 and 6 h with a conductometer Horiba Twin Model B-173. Statistical analysis was performed on conductivity data via Tukey′s HSD (honestly significant difference) test (a=0.05). Images of agrobacteria -infiltrated leaf spots were taken at 4 -5 dpi.
Cloning of the HopBA1 effector into bacterial type III secretion vector pCK014 to mobilize into the Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Pf0-1was performed as described ( Gantner et al., 2018 19. Gantner, J. ∙ Ordon, J. ∙ Ilse, T. ... Peripheral infrastructure vectors and an extended set of plant parts for the Modular Cloning system PLoS One. 2018; 13 , e0197185 Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar ). Overnight grown Pf0-1 carrying HopBA-1 or EV bacteria were resuspended in 10 mM MgCl 2 to OD 600 of 0.2 and infiltrated with a needleless syringe into rosette leaves of 5-6 weeks old Arabidopsis Ag-0 plants before noon. 3 infiltrated leaves were harvested from each pot, leaves from 3 pots were harvested and snap-frozen at 24 or 36 hpi for 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP detection. Images of infiltrated leaves were taken at 48 hpi.
2′,3′-cNMP were extracted from N. benthamiana or Arabidopsis as described ( Van Damme et al., 2014 67. Van Damme, T. ∙ Blancquaert, D. ∙ Couturon, P. ... Wounding stress causes rapid increase in concentration of the naturally occurring 2′,3′-isomers of cyclic guanosine- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cGMP and cAMP) in plant tissues Phytochemistry. 2014; 103 :59-66 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). For WT and RBA1 mutants infiltrated or RBA1 -hydrolase co-infiltrated N. benthamina leaves, 3 individual infiltrated zones were harvested and snap-frozen at 3 dpi. For 4 weeks old Col-0 and Atnudt7 eds1 Arabidopsis , 3 leaves were harvested from each pot; for 4 weeks old Atnudt7 leaves, due to the dwarf phenotype, 2 leaves were harvested from each pot. Leaves from 4 pots were harvested and snap-frozen. Frozen plant leaves were homogenized manually with a precooled mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen. 100 (±5) mg ground tissue was transferred to precooled 2 ml. Eppendorf tubes. 600 μl 4% acetic acid with 20 μl 1mM phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma) and 0.6 μl 1mM spike control 8-Br-2′,3′-cAMP (BioLog) were added to per 100 mg sample. The samples were vortexed for 2 min and subsequently centrifuged for 9 min at 9000 g . The supernatant was transferred into new precooled tubes. 800 μl chloroform was added to each tube. The tubes were gently inverted 6 times and then centrifuged at 6000 g for 6 min. Aqueous phase were collected and extracted again by chloroform. The samples were dried at 30°C in speed vacuum concentrator and reconstituted in 50 μl of water and vortexed for 1 min. The samples were centrifuged 12,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied to the LC-MS/MS for metabolite identification and quantification.
Chromatography was performed on a Nexera XR 40 series HPLC (Shimadzu) using a Synergi 4 μM Fusion-RP 80 Å 150×2mm column (Phenomenex). The column temperature was maintained at 40°C and the sample tray at 4°C. Samples (10 μl) were injected at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using 10 mM ammonium formate at pH 4.2 and methanol as mobile phases A and B, respectively. Metabolites were eluted using the profile 0-8 min, 8-90% B; 8-10 min, 90% B; 10-10.1 min 90-8% B; 10.1-20 min, 8% B. The LCMS-8060 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electro spray ionization (Shimadzu) was operated in positive mode. Scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to monitor analyte parent ion to product ion formation. MRM conditions were optimized using authentic standard chemicals including: 2′,3′-cAMP ([M+H] + 330.00>136.20, 330.00>99.15, 330.00>119.15), 2′,3′-cGMP ([M+H] + 346.00>152.15, 346.00 >135.20, 346.00>110.15), 2′,3′-cCMP ([M+H] + 306.00>112.15, 306.00>95.20, 306.00>178.20), 2′,3′-cUMP ([M+H] + 307.00>113.15, 307.00>195.10, 307.00>136.15), 8-Br-2′,3′-cAMP ([M+H] + 407.90 >214.00, 407.90>99.20, 407.90>69.25), 3′,5′-cAMP ([M+H] + 329.80>135.95, 329.80>311.90, 329.80>96.95), 3′,5′-cGMP ([M+H] + 345.90>151.95, 345.90>135.05, 345.90>110.20), 3′,5′-cCMP ([M+H] + 306.00>112.20, 306.00>95.20, 306.00>69.20), 3′,5′-cUMP ([M+H] + 307.00>97.15, 307.00>148.15, 307.00>113.15). Both Q1 and Q3 quadrupoles were maintained in unit resolution. LabSolutions LCMS v5.97 software was used for data acquisition and LabSolutions Postrun for processing (both Shimadzu). Metabolites were quantified by scheduled MRM peak integration using external calibration curves of standard chemicals.
If not otherwise indicated, statistical significance was determined with Tukey′s HSD test. For electrolyte leakage assay, each dot represents the conductometer readout value of an 8-mm leaf disc. Different colors indicate the biological replicates, n=15, α = 0.05. Shared lowercase letters indicate no significant difference. For 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP detection, height of the bar graph is the averaged fold change of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP from three biological replicates, n=3, α = 0.05, shared lowercase letters indicate no significant difference.
