Title: Cell Type-Specific Intralocus Interactions Reveal Oligodendrocyte Mechanisms in MS


Abstract: Summary

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by attack on oligodendrocytes within the central nervous system (CNS). Despite widespread use of immunomodulatory therapies, patients may still face progressive disability because of failure of myelin regeneration and loss of neurons, suggesting additional cellular pathologies. Here, we describe a general approach for identifying specific cell types in which a disease allele exerts a pathogenic effect. Applying this approach to MS risk loci, we pinpoint likely pathogenic cell types for 70%. In addition to T cell loci, we unexpectedly identified myeloid- and CNS-specific risk loci, including two sites that dysregulate transcriptional pause release in oligodendrocytes. Functional studies demonstrated inhibition of transcriptional elongation is a dominant pathway blocking oligodendrocyte maturation. Furthermore, pause release factors are frequently dysregulated in MS brain tissue. These data implicate cell-intrinsic aberrations outside of the immune system and suggest new avenues for therapeutic development.

Section: Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease involving central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of self-reactive lymphocytes, demyelination, and subsequent disability ( Bennett and Stüve, 2009; Hafler et al., 2005; McFarland and Martin, 2007 7.

More than 200 MS risk loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) ( Hafler et al., 2007; De Jager et al., 2009; Beecham et al., 2013; Patsopoulos et al., 2011; Sawcer et al., 2011 6.

Historically, these loci have largely implicated immunological target genes such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC), interleukins ( IL-2 and IL7R ) , and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 ( TNFR1 ) and pathways such as T cell differentiation and leukocyte activation ( Baranzini and Oksenberg, 2017; Dendrou et al., 2015; Sawcer et al., 2011 5.

Over the last decade, this T cell-centric model has evolved to include additional cell types such as B cells, myeloid cells, and resident immune cells in the CNS ( Filippi et al., 2018; Gandhi et al., 2010 31.

Recently, the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium completed a tour-de-force effort to expand the genetic map of MS, reporting genetic variants that account for ∼48% of MS heritability. In addition to T and B cells, these risk loci implicate innate immune cells and microglia ( Gosselin et al., 2017; International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium, 2019 36.

Oligodendrocytes also play a critical role in the progression of MS. In relapsing-remitting MS, patients experience acute periods of inflammation leading to demyelination and neurological symptoms, followed by periods of remission ( Dendrou et al., 2015 22. Dendrou, C.A. ∙ Fugger, L. ∙ Friese, M.A. Immunopathology of multiple sclerosis Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :545-558 Crossref Scopus (1589) PubMed Google Scholar ). During early stages of the disease, remyelination occurs to some degree, but it ultimately fails, leaving unmyelinated axons ( Keirstead and Blakemore, 1999 55. Keirstead, H.S. ∙ Blakemore, W.F. The role of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors in CNS remyelination Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 468 :183-197 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are essential for the generation of myelin sheaths. OPCs are present throughout the CNS, even in MS patients ( Chang et al., 2000, 2002 13. Chang, A. ∙ Nishiyama, A. ∙ Peterson, J. ... NG2-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in adult human brain and multiple sclerosis lesions J.

Med. 2002; 346 :165-173 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ), but fail to replace the significant numbers of lost oligodendrocytes. Current MS therapies are aimed at preventing further immune-mediated damage of myelin. While these drugs decrease relapse rates, they ultimately fail to slow long-term disease progression or avert neurodegeneration, though the long-term effects of early immunomodulatory intervention are not yet clear ( Feinstein et al., 2015; Haghikia et al., 2013 29.

Med. 2013; 19 :309-319 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further insights into the genetic contributions to MS risk have the potential to reveal whether risk SNPs affect genes with functional commonalities beyond autoimmunity and augment immune-centric therapeutic paradigms. While efforts are underway to develop neuroprotective or remyelination therapies, the contribution of CNS-intrinsic defects to MS risk remains unclear.
We developed a strategy to expand understanding of GWAS results by identifying cell types impacted by the presence of a given disease allele. Like many complex traits, MS risk variants are profoundly enriched in enhancer clusters, genetic loci characterized by a high density of active regulatory elements that physically interact in the context of the 3-dimensional genome ( Corradin et al., 2014; Hnisz et al., 2013 16.

Functional studies in model organisms and saturation mutagenesis experiments with CRISPR/Cas9 have shown that these regions often contain multiple functional enhancers that collectively contribute to gene regulation ( Canver et al., 2017; Corradin et al., 2014; Fortini et al., 2014; Glubb et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2015; He et al., 2015; Rajagopal et al., 2016 11.

Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :167-174 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously investigated the combinatorial role of DNA variants within enhancer clusters in defining target gene expression and altering risk to disease. We identified “outside variants,” DNA variants that physically interact with the same gene target as GWAS SNPs but are in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the reported GWAS SNP. Despite the low LD of outside variants and GWAS SNPs, we identified outside variants that collude with risk SNPs to influence target gene expression and significantly impact disease risk. Additionally, including outside variants in estimates of heritability increased total heritability explained by GWAS loci 3- to 5-fold ( Corradin et al., 2016 17. Corradin, O. ∙ Cohen, A.J. ∙ Luppino, J.M. ... Modeling disease risk through analysis of physical interactions between genetic variants within chromatin regulatory circuitry Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :1313-1320 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we identify outside variants that physically interact with the same target gene as MS GWAS SNPs and cooperatively contribute to MS risk. For each GWAS locus, outside variants provide additional information about the cis regulatory elements that are critical to disease pathogenesis. Our approach integrates these “intralocus” genetic risk factors with cell type-specific chromatin activity to identify the pathogenic cell type of individual MS risk loci ( Figure 1 A). The advantage of this approach over conventional “enrichment-based” strategies is that it facilitates the identification of relevant cell types for GWAS SNPs on a locus-by-locus basis. Using this method, we identified an unexpected oligodendrocyte intrinsic contribution to MS risk via disruption of key genes involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) release. Our data revealed a functional role for transcriptional pause release regulation in the maturation of oligodendrocytes. Collectively, these results illustrate the power of our approach to reveal new insights into disease biology by identifying the pathogenic cell type of disease alleles.

Section: Results

We developed an approach to identify the pathogenic cell type of individual disease-associated alleles by integrating intralocus genetic risk factors with cell type-specific chromatin activity. Candidate outside variants, SNPs that physically interact with the same target gene as MS GWAS SNPs, were identified using high-throughput chromosome conformation (Hi-C) data from 15 immune cell types as well as neural precursor cells (NPCs) ( Figure S1 ). We curated a panel of publicly available ChIP-seq experiments from 20 immune and CNS cell types and filtered candidate outside variants to those found in putative regulatory elements marked by H3K27ac enrichment ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). In order to evaluate the impact of candidate outside variants on MS disease risk, we utilized a two-tiered stratification approach that we previously described ( Corradin et al., 2016 17. Corradin, O. ∙ Cohen, A.J. ∙ Luppino, J.M. ... Modeling disease risk through analysis of physical interactions between genetic variants within chromatin regulatory circuitry Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :1313-1320 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A, left). Here, individuals are first stratified by genotype of GWAS SNP and then again by genotype of outside variant, resulting in up to nine possible genotype combinations. Each genotype combination is evaluated separately to identify outside variants that significantly contribute to disease risk beyond the effect of the GWAS SNP ( STAR Methods ; Figure S1 ). We identified outside variants that significantly altered MS risk for 126 out of 163 MS GWAS loci.
We reasoned that outside variants provide novel information about the intralocus genomic regions that contribute to disease risk and would enable us to distinguish local regulatory regions that alter risk from those that do not ( Figure 1 A, center). We hypothesized that comparing these genetic risk “barcodes” to cell type-specific molecular activity, such as active chromatin features (H3K27ac), could facilitate the identification of the cell type(s) in which risk alleles exert their pathogenic effect. For this approach, cell types for which active molecular activity coincided with regions that contributed to disease risk would be predicted as likely pathogenic ( Figure 1 A, purple). Conversely, cell types for which molecular activity did not coincide with genetic risk ( Figure 1 A, blue, green) would be less likely to be defined as pathogenic for a given disease locus.
An example is the IRF8 locus shown in Figure 1 B. Here, an MS risk SNP (highlighted in gray) lies within putative regulatory elements identified by histone modifications H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. Furthermore, the enhancer harboring the risk SNP was determined through promoter capture Hi-C to physically engage promoters in nine immune cell types, including activated CD4 + T cells (purple) and monocytes (blue) ( Javierre et al., 2016 51. Javierre, B.M. ∙ Burren, O.S. ∙ Wilder, S.P. ... Lineage-specific genome architecture links enhancers and non-coding disease variants to target gene promoters Cell. 2016; 167 :1369-1384.e1319 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (639) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified outside variants that significantly altered risk to MS, beyond the effect of the reported GWAS SNP ( Figure 1 B, top). An example outside variant site is highlighted in red. In contrast to the GWAS site, the molecular activity at this outside variant site is highly cell type specific, with H3K4me1/H3K27ac and Hi-C activity only identified in monocytes. Outside variant sites that influence disease risk and are involved in this type of cell type-specific intralocus interaction provide us with an opportunity to distinguish likely pathogenic cell types ( STAR Methods ).
We applied this approach to the 126 MS risk loci for which we identified outside variants and predicted pathogenic cell types for 104. This included loci predicted to act outside of T and B cells and, more surprisingly, outside of the immune system altogether. We grouped the GWAS loci based on the pathogenic cell type predicted by the outside variant approach; e.g., loci predicted to act primarily in the T cells were grouped together, and those predicted to act in monocytes and macrophages were grouped as myeloid predictions ( Figure 1 C, right; Table S2 ). We compared these results to the standard approach of overlapping the GWAS SNP (and SNPs in LD) with active regulatory elements identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). While MS GWAS SNPs are significantly enriched in T cell active regulatory elements ( Figure 1 C, bottom left), the majority of GWAS SNPs also overlap with H3K27ac across a wide variety of cell types, including B cells, monocytes, and macrophages ( Figure 1 C, top left). In contrast, for the majority of MS risk loci, the outside variant approach was able to narrow down specific cell types likely to be pathogenically impacted by the risk SNPs ( Figure 1 C, right). This included not only 35 loci predicted to act primarily in T cells but also 6 other loci predicted to impact B cells and 18 loci in myeloid cells. Among the risk loci predicted to affect myeloid cells was the IRF8 locus highlighted in Figure 1 B. This prediction is well supported by a previous study that demonstrated that Irf8 expression in monocytes, but not in T cells, is required for the progression of MS in the mouse experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS model ( Yoshida et al., 2014 82. Yoshida, Y. ∙ Yoshimi, R. ∙ Yoshii, H. ... The transcription factor IRF8 activates integrin-mediated TGF-β signaling and promotes neuroinflammation Immunity. 2014; 40 :187-198 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to loci that act in the immune system, we also identified six MS loci to be pathogenic specifically in the CNS. Thus, incorporating outside variants and intralocus enhancer-gene interactions enables us to identify loci that may act outside of the proposed disease causal cell types, which was not possible with previous enrichment-based strategies.
To validate these results, we utilized two diverse approaches: functional perturbation of outside variants and evaluation of genetic similarity of our outside variant prediction clusters with other human traits. Our approach is based on the premise that outside variants found in H3K27ac-enriched sites will functionally contribute to gene regulation in the identified cell type. We tested this premise by utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 to generate indels at outside variant sites and assessing the impact of mutations on target gene expression in a T cell model (Jurkat cells) and a B cell model (GM12878). We selected a locus that was identified to act specifically in T cells (rs7191700). While indels at the transcription start site (TSS) decreased expression of target gene SOCS1 in both cell types, mutations generated at outside variant sites decreased expression of the target gene in the T cell model, while mutations in the same loci induced little to no effect on expression in the B cell model ( Figure S3 ; Table S3 ). This supports not only that outside variant sites functionally contribute to gene regulation but also that our approach can distinguish cell type-specific effects.
We next sought to globally assess our predictions by evaluating which MS genetic risk factors contribute to the heritability of other diseases and traits ( Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015; Finucane et al., 2015 8. Bulik-Sullivan, B. ∙ Finucane, H.K. ∙ Anttila, V. ..., ReproGen Consortium, Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, Genetic Consortium for Anorexia Nervosa of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 An atlas of genetic correlations across human diseases and traits Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1236-1241 Crossref Scopus (2265) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Finucane, H.K. ∙ Bulik-Sullivan, B. ∙ Gusev, A. ..., ReproGen Consortium, Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, RACI Consortium Partitioning heritability by functional annotation using genome-wide association summary statistics Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1228-1235 Crossref Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autoimmune disorders, including MS, have a strong shared genetic architecture ( Cotsapas et al., 2011; Beecham et al., 2013 6. Beecham, A.H. ∙ Patsopoulos, N.A. ∙ Xifara, D.K. ..., International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC), Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2), International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) Analysis of immune-related loci identifies 48 new susceptibility variants for multiple sclerosis Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 :1353-1360 Crossref Scopus (1080) PubMed Google Scholar 18. Cotsapas, C. ∙ Voight, B.F. ∙ Rossin, E. ..., FOCiS Network of Consortia Pervasive sharing of genetic effects in autoimmune disease PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 :e1002254 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ). Risk loci identified by GWASs often confer risk to multiple autoimmune traits. Thus, we hypothesized that MS risk loci that act in the T cells would be most likely to explain heritability for other autoimmune disorders, while any MS risk loci that act outside of the immune system would be unlikely to coincide with genetic risk to autoimmune disorders. We found that the loci predicted to act in the T cells explained the largest portion of genetic similarity with other autoimmune disorders, while CNS predicted loci explained minimal heritability of other autoimmune disorders. This supports our predictions, as risk factors that act in the CNS in MS are the most likely to distinguish MS from other autoimmune disorders ( Figure 1 D, left).
We applied this approach to a total of 28 disorders ( Table S1 ) and found that the MS risk loci predicted to act in the CNS had the strongest similarity with traits with known CNS function, including depression, autism, and body mass index ( Locke et al., 2015 61. Locke, A.E. ∙ Kahali, B. ∙ Berndt, S.I. ..., LifeLines Cohort Study, ADIPOGen Consortium, AGEN-BMI Working Group, CARDIOGRAMplusC4D Consortium, CKDGen Consortium, GLGC, ICBP, MAGIC Investigators, MuTHER Consortium, MIGen Consortium, PAGE Consortium, ReproGen Consortium, GENIE Consortium, International Endogene Consortium Genetic studies of body mass index yield new insights for obesity biology Nature. 2015; 518 :197-206 Crossref Scopus (3170) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 D, right). Importantly, none of these traits share a strong genetic correlation with MS. The genetic overlap was specific to the MS risk loci we predicted to act in the CNS. Together, these results demonstrate that outside variants can be utilized to define likely pathogenic cell types of individual risk loci and furthermore identify groups of risk loci that act within the same cell type or lineage.
Despite failure of remyelination being a dominant cellular pathology in MS patients, an oligodendrocyte-intrinsic contribution to MS risk or severity has not yet been recognized. Using our outside variant approach, we identified three loci to be pathogenic specifically in the oligodendrocyte lineage. This prediction was consistent across three biological replicates of ChIP-seq of oligodendrocytes isolated from independent human donors ( Kozlenkov et al., 2018 56. Kozlenkov, A. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Apontes, P. ... A unique role for DNA (hydroxy)methylation in epigenetic regulation of human inhibitory neurons Sci. Adv. 2018; 4 :eaau6190 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 A–2D). We identified putative target genes using publicly available Hi-C data of upstream neural progenitors and prefrontal cortex ( Schmitt et al., 2016 77. Schmitt, A.D. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Jung, I. ... A compendium of chromatin contact maps reveals spatially active regions in the human genome Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :2042-2059 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (517) PubMed Google Scholar ). For two out of three loci, we found that GWAS SNPs and outside variants physically interacted with target genes that play a key role in the regulation of transcriptional elongation via the release of promoter-proximal RNAPII. This included a bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) containing protein BRD3 ( Figures 2 C and 2D), which facilitates transcriptional elongation ( Dai et al., 2019; LeRoy et al., 2008 20. Dai, J. ∙ Zhou, S. ∙ Ge, Q. ... Recruitment of Brd3 and Brd4 to acetylated chromatin is essential for proinflammatory cytokine-induced matrix-degrading enzyme expression J. Orthop. Surg.

Cell. 2008; 30 :51-60 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ), and HEXIM1/2 ( Figures 2 A and 2B), which inhibits transcriptional elongation by sequestering positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in an inactive complex ( Jonkers and Lis, 2015; Young et al., 2007 52. Jonkers, I. ∙ Lis, J.T. Getting up to speed with transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 :167-177 Crossref Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Young, T.M. ∙ Tsai, M. ∙ Tian, B. ... Cellular mRNA activates transcription elongation by displacing 7SK RNA PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 :e1010 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that several outside variant sites that are active enhancers in the oligodendrocytes to also be active in neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) and thus leveraged NPCs to assess the functional impact of these regions on gene regulation. Mutations at outside variant sites induced by CRISPR/Cas9 led to a significant reduction in HEXIM1 ( Figure 2 E) and BRD3 ( Figure 2 F) mRNA levels at each respective locus, demonstrating the functional role these sites play in regulating the transcription of pause release factors.
These observations led to the hypothesis that dysregulation of transcriptional elongation in the oligodendrocyte lineage contributes to MS pathogenesis. Transcriptional pausing is a critical mechanism by which the cell regulates gene expression. A growing number of genes have been linked to the regulation of promoter-proximal RNAPII pausing ( Jonkers and Lis, 2015 52. Jonkers, I. ∙ Lis, J.T. Getting up to speed with transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 :167-177 Crossref Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar ). We aimed to assess the genetic contribution of this pathway to MS, independent of the outside variant approach. We utilized LD score regression (LDSR) to assess MS heritability enrichment for two curated gene sets derived from Reactome ( Fabregat et al., 2018 26. Fabregat, A. ∙ Jupe, S. ∙ Matthews, L. ... The Reactome pathway knowledgebase Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D649-D655 Crossref Scopus (1816) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Gene Ontology (GO) (see STAR Methods ) ( Finucane et al., 2015 32. Finucane, H.K. ∙ Bulik-Sullivan, B. ∙ Gusev, A. ..., ReproGen Consortium, Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, RACI Consortium Partitioning heritability by functional annotation using genome-wide association summary statistics Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1228-1235 Crossref Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both transcriptional pausing gene sets were significantly enriched for MS heritability, supporting the hypothesis that genetic variation in this pathway contributes to MS ( Figure 2 G; Table S4 ).
Together, these results provide genetic support for dysregulation of pause release genes in the oligodendrocyte lineage as a basis for MS risk. We sought to utilize an unbiased approach to identify fundamental pathways that are critical to the maturation of oligodendrocytes and thus the generation of new myelin. Performing an unbiased screen enabled us to identify not only whether transcriptional pause release plays a role in oligodendrocyte maturation but also how this pathway compares to other pathways that are critical to the generation of new myelin.
We adapted a high-content image-based phenotypic screening platform with a proven record identifying modulators of oligodendrocyte maturation ( Najm et al., 2011, 2015 67. Najm, F.J. ∙ Zaremba, A. ∙ Caprariello, A.V. ... Rapid and robust generation of functional oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from epiblast stem cells Nat.

Drug-based modulation of endogenous stem cells promotes functional remyelination in vivo Nature. 2015; 522 :216-220 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). A library of 3,141 compounds with well-annotated targets was screened to identify compounds that block or delay the generation of mouse oligodendrocytes from OPCs. Compounds that negatively impacted cell viability or oligodendrocyte lineage marker OLIG2 were excluded. Known pro-myelinating compounds benztropine, clemastine, ketoconazole, and miconazole increased the fraction of cells positive for the oligodendrocyte marker myelin basic protein (MBP), validating the overall performance of the screen ( Deshmukh et al., 2013; Mei et al., 2014; Najm et al., 2015 23. Deshmukh, V.A. ∙ Tardif, V. ∙ Lyssiotis, C.A. ... A regenerative approach to the treatment of multiple sclerosis Nature. 2013; 502 :327-332 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Mei, F. ∙ Fancy, S.P.J. ∙ Shen, Y.A. ... Micropillar arrays as a high-throughput screening platform for therapeutics in multiple sclerosis Nat.

Drug-based modulation of endogenous stem cells promotes functional remyelination in vivo Nature. 2015; 522 :216-220 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 A and S4 A–S4C). Consistent with our outside variant genetic analysis, we found four dual-bromodomain BET inhibitors, which potently inhibit transcriptional elongation, in the top 2% of compounds that inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation. In total, four out of seven BET bromodomain inhibitors included in the screen were classified as hits at the single dose tested, making it the predominant pathway identified in our screen to inhibit oligodendrocyte maturation ( Figure 3 A).
To further evaluate the role of BET bromodomain inhibition on myelination, we utilized the canonical small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 ( Filippakopoulos et al., 2010 30. Filippakopoulos, P. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Picaud, S. ... Selective inhibition of BET bromodomains Nature. 2010; 468 :1067-1073 Crossref Scopus (3237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Racemic JQ1 and the active (S)- stereoisomer both dramatically inhibited cell maturation in a dose-dependent manner, while expression of OLIG2 was maintained ( Figures 3 B–3D and S4 D). In contrast, vehicle and the inactive (R)- stereoisomer did not inhibit the maturation of oligodendrocytes, confirming the on-target effect of JQ1 ( Figures 3 B and 3D). We next co-cultured OPCs with rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG)-derived neurons in order to test the impact on myelination in more physiologically relevant conditions. We found that BET bromodomain inhibition prevented OPCs from developing and associating with neural axons ( Figures 3 E and S4 E). We found the effect of JQ1 to be reversible in each of these experiments, as removing JQ1 enabled cells to mature into myelinating oligodendrocytes ( Figures 3 D, 3E, and S4 E). This suggests that JQ1 did not divert the cells to an alternative cell state; rather, JQ1 temporarily blocked maturation. Finally, since our primary OPC screening platform utilized mouse cells, we validated that JQ1 also inhibits the generation of human oligodendrocytes using OPCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) ( Figures S4 G). Together, these findings demonstrate that BET bromodomain inhibitors have a substantial functional impact on the generation of new myelinating oligodendrocytes.
To determine whether JQ1’s effect on oligodendrocyte maturation is specifically attributable to its impact on transcriptional elongation, we compared gene expression in OPCs in maintenance conditions to that of cells cultured for 3 days in pro-maturation conditions with or without JQ1 ( Figure S5 A). We found that genes downregulated as OPCs differentiate to oligodendrocytes were also concordantly downregulated in the presence of JQ1. Likewise, genes that have consistent expression in OPCs and oligodendrocytes were not significantly altered by JQ1 treatment ( Figures S5 B–S5E). In contrast, genes that are normally induced during oligodendrocyte development, such as the proteolipid protein 1 ( Plp1 ), failed to be activated in the presence of JQ1 ( Figures S5 F and S5G). Thus, BET bromodomain inhibition hinders oligodendrocyte maturation by preventing transcriptional activation of oligodendrocyte-specific genes. We evaluated RNAPII occupancy at genes inhibited by JQ1 using RNAPII ChIP-seq. In the presence of JQ1, we found a decrease in RNAPII occupancy at the gene bodies of oligodendrocyte-specific genes, implicating inhibited transcriptional elongation as the mechanism by which JQ1 prevents activation of the oligodendrocyte gene program ( Figures S5 H–S5J).
To more broadly evaluate whether perturbation of the transcriptional elongation blocks oligodendrocyte maturation, we tested whether inhibition of other proteins in the transcriptional elongation pathway resulted in similar phenotypes. Inhibition of either the P-TEFb component CDK9 or the histone methyltransferase DOT1L also blocked oligodendrocyte maturation, supporting the conclusion that transcriptional elongation is a dominant pathway blocking oligodendrocyte generation and myelination from OPCs ( Figures S5 K and S5L).
Our outside variant approach led to the hypothesis that dysregulation of transcriptional elongation in oligodendrocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of MS. We found that chemical inhibition of this pathway impacted the maturation of oligodendrocytes. We next sought to assess whether dysregulation of Hexim1 , a critical gene target in one of our predicted loci with a known role for inhibiting transcriptional elongation ( Jonkers and Lis, 2015; Young et al., 2007 52. Jonkers, I. ∙ Lis, J.T. Getting up to speed with transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 :167-177 Crossref Scopus (604) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Young, T.M. ∙ Tsai, M. ∙ Tian, B. ... Cellular mRNA activates transcription elongation by displacing 7SK RNA PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 :e1010 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), is sufficient to alter oligodendrocyte maturation. We utilized CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to alter Hexim1 transcript levels. We designed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target the Hexim1 promoter with catalytically dead Cas9 fused to either Kruppel-associated box (dCas9-KRAB) or VP64 (dCas9-VP64) in mouse OPCs to facilitate Hexim1 knockdown and Hexim1 activation, respectively.
OPCs transduced with CRISPRi and CRISPRa constructs were cultured for 3 days in pro-maturation conditions using the same approach as our chemical screen. CRISPRa targeted to the Hexim1 promoter led to a 2-fold increase in Hexim1 gene expression relative to the non-targeting control (NTC) gRNA, whereas CRISPRi led to a 4-fold decrease in Hexim1 expression ( Figures 4 A and 4D). We next assessed whether the alteration in expression was sufficient to disrupt oligodendrocyte maturation. We found that CRISPR-mediated activation led to a 50% reduction in MBP-positive cells (2B,C). In constrast, CRISPR-mediated knockdown of Hexim1 resulted in a 8-fold increase in the proportion of MBP-positive cells ( Figures 4 E and 4F). As Hexim1 is an inhibitor of transcriptional elongation, this is directionally consistent with the results of our drug screen that indicate inhibition of transcriptional elongation reduces the generation of mature oligodendrocyte from OPCs. These results suggest that dysregulation of Hexim1 alone is sufficient to alter oligodendrocyte maturation from OPCs. Furthermore, this supports our hypothesis that dysregulation of transcriptional elongation in the oligodendrocytes contributes to MS risk by inhibiting the maturation of oligodendrocytes.
To further evaluate the role of transcriptional pausing in MS, we evaluated the expression of these genes in previously published MS patient tissue microarray data ( Huynh et al., 2014 49. Huynh, J.L. ∙ Garg, P. ∙ Thin, T.H. ... Epigenome-wide differences in pathology-free regions of multiple sclerosis-affected brains Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :121-130 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, BRD3 expression was significantly downregulated in white matter (WM) lesions of MS patients and HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 expression was significantly increased in MS patient WM lesions compared to controls ( Figure 5 A). This is directionally consistent with increased transcriptional pausing as BRD3 is an activator of transcriptional elongation and HEXIM proteins inhibit elongation.
Given the potential confounders of gene expression analysis in bulk MS lesion tissue such as immune infiltration and oligodendrocyte death, we next examined patient tissue sections immunostained for HEXIM1 to determine whether dysregulation occurred in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Comparison of sections from patient lesions showed an increase of HEXIM1 positive cells as compared to healthy controls ( Figure 5 B; Table S5 ). We utilized PLP1, a marker of early or mature oligodendrocyte identity, to evaluate HEXIM1 expression specifically in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. We quantified the number of PLP1-positive oligodendrocyte lineage cells that also expressed HEXIM1 in patient lesions compared to controls. Patients with primary progressive MS displayed a 6-fold increase in the number of cells co-stained for HEXIM1 and PLP1 as compared to normal controls. Similarly, secondary progressive MS patient lesions showed a 10-fold increase in HEXIM1/PLP1 double-positive cells ( Figure 5 C). These data provide further evidence for cell-intrinsic defects in the transcriptional elongation pathway of the MS patient oligodendrocyte lineage.

Section: Discussion

Here, we describe an approach to identify the pathogenic cell type of individual risk loci. This approach differs from previous methods that utilize results from GWASs to identify disease critical cell types, as it evaluates each locus independently. This enables identification of clusters of risk loci that contribute to disease via dysregulation of the same cell type and thus enables us to identify disease critical pathways that may be obscured when all risk loci are evaluated collectively. Here, we demonstrate the power of this approach by identifying risk loci that act via dysregulation of expression in the oligodendrocytes within a shared pathway.
We functionally validated these computational findings with an unbiased approach to identify the pathways critical to the maturation of oligodendrocytes. We found that disruption of transcriptional pause release is a dominant pathway critical for oligodendrocyte maturation and thereby the generation of new myelin. In patient brain tissue samples, we also found that these gene targets were frequently dysregulated in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Importantly, our findings do not contradict the autoimmune T cell-centric model of MS pathogenesis. Rather, we implicate an additional oligodendrocyte-intrinsic aspect of MS risk. These results suggest that some individuals may be predisposed toward increased transcriptional pausing and therefore be less efficient at generating new myelinating oligodendrocytes from OPCs. Whether the effect of these variants on myelin is more pronounced in the context of MS remains unknown.
While many genetic risk loci have implicated lymphocyte dysregulation, relatively few have implicated CNS cells, including astrocytes ( Ponath et al., 2018 72. Ponath, G. ∙ Lincoln, M.R. ∙ Levine-Ritterman, M. ... Enhanced astrocyte responses are driven by a genetic risk allele associated with multiple sclerosis Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5337 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) and microglia ( Gosselin et al., 2017; International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium, 2019 36. Gosselin, D. ∙ Skola, D. ∙ Coufal, N.G. ... An environment-dependent transcriptional network specifies human microglia identity Science. 2017; 356 :eaal3222 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar 50. International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium Multiple sclerosis genomic map implicates peripheral immune cells and microglia in susceptibility Science. 2019; 365 :eaav7188 Crossref Scopus (754) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the expected role of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the etiology of MS, to our knowledge, this study presents the first example of oligodendrocyte-intrinsic dysfunction contributing to MS genetic risk. We also predicted three MS risk loci to contribute to MS risk via dysregulation of gene expression in neurons. Among the potential gene targets nominated by physical interaction with these GWAS loci in brain Hi-C data are BRINP1 and AVIL ( Jung et al., 2019 54. Jung, I. ∙ Schmitt, A. ∙ Diao, Y. ... A compendium of promoter-centered long-range chromatin interactions in the human genome Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1442-1449 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, both of these genes have been implicated in the positive regulation of neuronal differentiation ( Ashburner et al., 2000; The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2019 3. Ashburner, M. ∙ Ball, C.A. ∙ Blake, J.A. ..., The Gene Ontology Consortium Gene Ontology: tool for the unification of biology Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :25-29 Crossref Scopus (30809) PubMed Google Scholar 79. The Gene Ontology Consortium The Gene Ontology Resource: 20 years and still GOing strong Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D330-D338 Crossref Scopus (2880) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies are required to evaluate the critical gene targets of these loci and their potential contribution to neuronal dysfunction in MS pathogenesis. Predicting the pathogenic cell type of these loci enables the generation of specific hypotheses that can guide future functional studies that reveal further insights into the pathogenesis of MS.
We predicted 98 MS risk loci to act via dysregulation of immune cells and 6 loci to contribute to MS through CNS-intrinsic functions. It is however important to note that our predictions may be underestimating the role of CNS cell types in MS risk. Our approach is reliant upon high quality epigenomic profiles, which can be challenging to derive for neuronal and glial cell types. As our understanding of the epigenetic landscape of the human brain expands ( Jung et al., 2019 54. Jung, I. ∙ Schmitt, A. ∙ Diao, Y. ... A compendium of promoter-centered long-range chromatin interactions in the human genome Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :1442-1449 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), we will be able to assess the impact of MS risk loci on the function of cell types such as microglia and astrocytes. Disease- or context-specific ChIP-seq profiling could also aid identification of regulatory elements that contribute to disease risk specifically in the environmental context of the trait. Additionally, here we evaluated genetic variants that contribute to risk of developing MS. Genetic variants that alter oligodendrocytes and other CNS cell types may be more likely to contribute to other MS characteristics such as severity, relapse rate, or rate of progression. Further studies that characterize the genetic risk associated with these phenotypes could reveal additional roles of oligodendrocytes in MS pathogenesis.
Enrichment-based approaches nominate disease relevant cell types by comparing epigenomic profiles to genetic risk to identify cells types that are globally enriched for genetic contribution to disease. Multiple studies have demonstrated that regulatory elements active in T cells are enriched for MS genetic risk ( Cusanovich et al., 2018; Farh et al., 2014; Hnisz et al., 2013; Maurano et al., 2012 19.

Genetic and epigenetic fine mapping of causal autoimmune disease variants Nature. 2014; 518 :337-343 Crossref Scopus (1349) PubMed Google Scholar identified likely causal SNPs for autoimmune disease risk loci and compared these loci to ChIP-seq from a comprehensive panel of immune cell types. They found the likely causal SNPs for MS to be enriched for active regulatory elements found in multiple immune cells, with strongest enrichment among stimulated T helper cell populations and B cells. These enrichment-based strategies are powerful approaches that can reveal primary disease causal cell types essential to disease pathogenesis. The outside variant approach complements these methods by providing the opportunity to identify risk loci that act outside of the primary disease causal cell type. Despite several limiting factors, such as the degree of regulatory element cell type specificity, the accuracy by which ChIP-seq can distinguish active and inactive regulatory elements, and the extent of LD within each locus, we identified pathogenic cell types for 104 MS GWAS loci. Together, these results suggest that applying this approach to multiple diseases and cell types could facilitate rapid delineation of the pathogenic consequence of disease-associated variants.

Human, male Jurkat cells (clone E6-1; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; ATCC) and penicillin (100 U/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 1x10 5 – 1x10 6 cells/ml and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
Human, female GM12878 cells (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were maintained in RPMI 1640, 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburg, PA) and penicillin (100 U/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 2x10 5 – 1x10 6 cells/ml and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
Neuronal differentiation of human, male and female embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) was performed similarly to previous work ( Muffat et al., 2016 66. Muffat, J. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Yuan, B. ... Efficient derivation of microglia-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :1358-1367 Crossref Scopus (459) PubMed Google Scholar ). WIBR3 ESCs ( Lengner et al., 2010 58. Lengner, C.J. ∙ Gimelbrant, A.A. ∙ Erwin, J.A. ... Derivation of pre-X inactivation human embryonic stem cells under physiological oxygen concentrations Cell. 2010; 141 :872-883 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar ), and iPSCs generated from fibroblasts (human, 88 year old female and 29 year old male; Coriell Institute for Medical Research) were dissociated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (isolated from E13.5 embryos of male and female CD-1 mice (in accordance with protocols approved by Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Committee on Animal Care); Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) with 1.5 mg/mL collagenase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were plated in Matrigel-coated 6 well plates (Corning Life Sciences, Oneonta, NY) at a density of ≥ 5x10 6 cells per well in neuroglial differentiation media (NGD; ( Muffat et al., 2016 66. Muffat, J. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Yuan, B. ... Efficient derivation of microglia-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :1358-1367 Crossref Scopus (459) PubMed Google Scholar )) containing 10 ng/mL human recombinant FGF-Basic (AA 1-155) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), an additional 10 mM of human insulin (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA), 10 μM Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (MilliporeSigma), and 2.5 μM dorsomorphin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and received fresh NGD media containing FGF, insulin and dorsomorphin every day for ∼8-12 days, at which point neural rosettes were visible throughout the well. Dorsomorphin was then removed, and cells were passaged with StemPro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 1:1 split ratio, and then expanded for two passages plating ≥ 5x10 6 cells per well. Cells were frozen at passage 3 at 10 7 cells per cryovial in NGD media containing FGF, insulin and ROCK inhibitor, and each vial was thawed into one Matrigel-coated well in the same media for all experiments.
Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were maintained in Neurobasal Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 0.5X Gem21 Neuroplex without Vitamin A (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA), 0.2% (w/v) AlbuMAX I lipid-rich bovine serum albumin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X N2 NeuroPlex serum-free supplement (Gemini Bio-Products, #400-163), 0.05 M NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2 mM GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 3.5 ng/ml biotin (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA) dissolved in 1 M NaOH (MilliporeSigma), 10 μM ascorbic acid (MilliporeSigma), 0.017% DL-lactic acid syrup (MilliporeSigma), 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF-Basic (AA 1-155), and 0.02 mg/ml human insulin at 1x10 6 -5x10 6 cells/ml on Matrigel-coated plates and medium was replaced each day. For passaging, cells were dissociated with accutase and plated in the above media with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y27632. NPCs were supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
OPCs were cultured as described previously, with the exception that SHH was not used for maintenance or differentiation ( Najm et al., 2011 67. Najm, F.J. ∙ Zaremba, A. ∙ Caprariello, A.V. ... Rapid and robust generation of functional oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from epiblast stem cells Nat. Methods. 2011; 8 :957-962 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were handled under protocols approved by Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). First, epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) were isolated from 129S/SvEv male embryos (E3.5; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). For neural rosette formation, cells were plated in Knockout Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 20% Knockout Serum Replacement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2 mM GlutaMax, 1X nonessential amino acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (MilliporeSigma) (EpiSC basal medium) plus 100 ng/ml Noggin (R&D Systems), 20 μM SB431542 (MilliporeSigma) and 2 μM dorsomorphin (MilliporeSigma). After 24 hours, cells were fed with 1 part EpiSC basal medium and 1 part neural basal medium (DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X high insulin N-2 supplement (R&D Systems), 1X B-27 without vitamin A (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2 mM GlutaMax) supplemented with 100 ng/ml Noggin, 20 μM SB431542, and 2 μM dorsomorphin. After 24 hours, cells were fed with neural basal medium plus 100 ng/ml Noggin. After an additional 24 hours, 10 μM all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA; MilliporeSigma) was added. For differentiation into OPCs, neural rosettes were passaged into Nunclon-Δ plates coated with poly-L-ornithine (MilliporeSigma) and laminin (MilliporeSigma). Cells were maintained in neural basal medium plus 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2; R&D Systems) and 20 ng/ml PDGF-AA (R&D Systems). For differentiation into oligodendrocytes, OPCs were plated in neural basal medium plus 0.4 ng/ml 3,3′,5-triiodothronine (T3; MilliporeSigma), 100 ng/ml Noggin, 10 μM dibutyryl cyclic-AMP sodium salt (cAMP; MilliporeSigma), 100 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; R&D Systems), and 10 ng/ml neurotrophin-3 (NT-3; R&D Systems). Cultures were maintained in 37°C with 5% CO 2 supplemented with 50U penicillin-streptomycin.
Wild-type, mixed sex B6CBACaF1/J-Aw-J/A mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were euthanized two days after birth and cerebral cortex was dissected in ice cold DMEM/F12 with 50U penicillin-streptomycin. The meninges were removed and tissue was dissociated to single cells using the Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) with gentle trituration. Cell aggregates were excluded using a 70 μm Corning Falcon cell strainer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were cultured as described in mouse OPC culture. Mice were handled under protocols approved by Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine’s IACUC.
Human OPCs were generated from iPSCs as previously described ( Nevin et al., 2017 69. Nevin, Z.S. ∙ Factor, D.C. ∙ Karl, R.T. ... Modeling the mutational and phenotypic landscapes of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease with human iPSC-derived oligodendrocytes Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2017; 100 :617-634 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ) from a 16 year old male donor. For seven days, cells were maintained in DMEM/F12, 1X high insulin N-2 supplement, 10 μM SB431542, 250 nM LDN189193 (R&D Systems), and 100 nM ATRA. For the next four days, cells were fed daily with DMEM/F12, 1X low insulin N-2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 nM ATRA, and 1 μM smoothened agonist (SAG; MilliporeSigma). Cells were then lifted with a cell scraper and plated into ultra-low attachment plates (Corning Life Sciences) for eight days during which two-thirds medium was replaced with DMEM/F12, 1X low insulin N-2 supplement, 1X B-27 supplement without vitamin A, 100 nM ATRA, and 1 μM SAG every other day. For the next 10 days, cells underwent two-thirds medium changes of DMEM/F12, 1X low insulin N-2, 1X B-27, 10 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AA; R&D Systems), 10 ng/mL IGF-1, 5 ng/mL hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; R&D Systems), 10 ng/mL NT-3, 60 ng/mL T3, 100 ng/mL biotin, 1 μM cAMP, and 25 μg/mL insulin. Cells were then plated onto poly-L-ornithine- and laminin-coated plates for 30 days during which two-thirds medium was replaced with DMEM/F12, 1X low insulin N-2, 1X B-27, 10 ng/mL PDGF-AA, 10 ng/mL IGF-1, 5 ng/mL HGF, 10 ng/mL NT-3, 60 ng/mL T3, 100 ng/mL biotin, 1 μM cAMP, and 25 μg/mL insulin every other day. OPC cultures were maintained in PDGF-AA, IGF-1, and HGF containing media through day 70. For OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes, cells were passaged into medium lacking PDGF-AA, IGF-1, and HGF. All medium was supplemented with 5 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
DRG cultures were grown as previously described ( Nevin et al., 2017 69. Nevin, Z.S. ∙ Factor, D.C. ∙ Karl, R.T. ... Modeling the mutational and phenotypic landscapes of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease with human iPSC-derived oligodendrocytes Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2017; 100 :617-634 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 5x10 4 DRG neurons derived from E15.5 embryos were plated into 24-well VisiPlates (PerkinElmer) precoated with rat tail collagen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dried. Cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Media (MEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% FBS, 2% glucose (MilliporeSigma), plus 100 ng/ml NGF (R&D Systems) for 24 h and then fed with MEM, 2% glucose, 1X high insulin N-2 supplement, 245 ng/ml FDU (MilliporeSigma), 245 ng/ml uridine (MilliporeSigma) and 100 ng/ml NGF. Cells were maintained until day 20 (human OPCs) or day 30 (mouse OPCs) prior to seeding 5x10 4 OPCs per well. Cultures were supplemented with 5 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Plates were fixed at day 37 or 40 and immunostained as described below. Rats were handled under protocols approved by Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine’s IACUC.
Human brains (male and female ages 27 – 76; Table S5 ) were collected as part of the tissue procurement program approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the relevant Cleveland Clinic Institutional regulations and guidelines.
Multiple sclerosis genetic data was obtained from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. This includes 9,772 cases and 5,175 controls of European descent. Prior to imputation, genotypes and samples were filtered based on the quality control detailed by WTCCC2 ( Sawcer et al., 2011 75. Sawcer, S. ∙ Hellenthal, G. ∙ Pirinen, M. ..., International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium, Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 Genetic risk and a primary role for cell-mediated immune mechanisms in multiple sclerosis Nature. 2011; 476 :214-219 Crossref Scopus (2201) PubMed Google Scholar ). IMPUTE2 with the 1000 genomes integrated reference panel (Phase 1) was utilized to perform imputation ( Howie et al., 2009 47. Howie, B.N. ∙ Donnelly, P. ∙ Marchini, J. A flexible and accurate genotype imputation method for the next generation of genome-wide association studies PLoS Genet. 2009; 5 :e1000529 Crossref Scopus (3029) PubMed Google Scholar ). SNPs departing from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE p < 1E-6) were excluded. Two filters were applied to identify high quality SNPs. First, we required SNPs have INFO scores > 0.4 in > 95% of samples. Second, we excluded genotypes that did not surpass a stringent imputation filter requiring > 0.9 confidence for the genotype call and < 0.3 for the remaining two potential genotypes for at least 10% of cases and 10% controls.
Preprocessed promoter capture Hi-C data was obtained for 15 immune cell types. Physical interactions with promoters were identified using the CHiCAGO pipeline ( Cairns et al., 2016 10. Cairns, J. ∙ Freire-Pritchett, P. ∙ Wingett, S.W. ... CHiCAGO: robust detection of DNA looping interactions in capture Hi-C data Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :127 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ) as previously described ( Javierre et al., 2016 51. Javierre, B.M. ∙ Burren, O.S. ∙ Wilder, S.P. ... Lineage-specific genome architecture links enhancers and non-coding disease variants to target gene promoters Cell. 2016; 167 :1369-1384.e1319 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (639) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interactions with a CHiCAGO score ≥ 5 in at least one sample were utilized for subsequent analyses. Previously published NPC Hi-C data ( Dixon et al., 2015 24. Dixon, J.R. ∙ Jung, I. ∙ Selvaraj, S. ... Chromatin architecture reorganization during stem cell differentiation Nature. 2015; 518 :331-336 Crossref Scopus (1104) PubMed Google Scholar ) were incorporated to capture potential CNS-specific interactions. NPC Hi-C data was processed with HiC-Pro ( Servant et al., 2015 78. Servant, N. ∙ Varoquaux, N. ∙ Lajoie, B.R. ... HiC-Pro: an optimized and flexible pipeline for Hi-C data processing Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :259 Crossref Scopus (1356) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 57. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ) with bin size 20-kb. Pairwise contacts with ICE normalized scores > 4 (top 10 th percentile of intrachromosome contacts), were identified as putative physical interactions. Pairwise physical interactions were filtered to include only those that involved a transcription start site (TSS) in at least one end.
A panel of 20 cell types from the immune and central nervous system were acquired from previously published ChIP-seq studies. The majority of immune cell ChIP-seq experiments were acquired from the BLUEPRINT consortium ( Adams et al., 2012 1. Adams, D. ∙ Altucci, L. ∙ Antonarakis, S.E. ... BLUEPRINT to decode the epigenetic signature written in blood Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :224-226 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). BLUEPRINT preprocessed data, including replicates for each cell type where available, were downloaded. Published BLUEPRINT samples met standard quality control metrics including fraction of reads in peaks (FriP) score > 0.01, normalized strand correlation (NSC) > 1.05, and relative strand correlation (RSC) > 0.8.
Previously published H3K27ac ChIP-seq for Th17 ( Aschenbrenner et al., 2018 2. Aschenbrenner, D. ∙ Foglierini, M. ∙ Jarrossay, D. ... An immunoregulatory and tissue-residency program modulated by c-MAF in human T H 17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1126-1136 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), (GABA)ergic inhibitory neurons, glutamatergic excitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes ( Kozlenkov et al., 2018 56. Kozlenkov, A. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Apontes, P. ... A unique role for DNA (hydroxy)methylation in epigenetic regulation of human inhibitory neurons Sci. Adv. 2018; 4 :eaau6190 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) were also obtained. These samples were evaluated with ChIPQC ( Carroll et al., 2014 12. Carroll, T.S. ∙ Liang, Z. ∙ Salama, R. ... Impact of artifact removal on ChIP quality metrics in ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo data Front. Genet. 2014; 5 :75 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ) and each were found to pass the same ChIP QC metrics as BLUEPRINT (FriP score > 0.01, NSC > 1.05 and RSC > 0.8). We processed these raw datasets following a pipeline similar to BLUEPRINT ( Chen et al., 2016 15. Chen, L. ∙ Ge, B. ∙ Casale, F.P. ... Genetic drivers of epigenetic and transcriptional variation in human immune cells Cell. 2016; 167 :1398-1414.e1324 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar ) on these additional samples, detailed below. We aligned reads to hg38 (GRCh38) using BWA quality threshold of 15 (bwa aln -q 15). Duplicate reads and reads with mapping quality < 15 were discarded using SAMtools ( Li et al., 2009 60. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38834) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peaks were called using MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 84. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (10883) PubMed Google Scholar ) standard parameters with narrow peaks option. Fragment size input for MAC2 algorithm was calculated using PhantomPeakQualTools ( Marinov et al., 2014 62. Marinov, G.K. ∙ Kundaje, A. ∙ Park, P.J. ... Large-scale quality analysis of published ChIP-seq data G3 (Bethesda). 2014; 4 :209-223 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ).
As an additional QC metric, hierarchical clustering was utilized to compare curated samples including sample replicates. We verified that immune cell types clustered as expected based on cellular lineage as well as correlated well within replicates ( Figure S2 ). Finally, all of the samples that passed these standard QC metrics were visually evaluated on the genome browser. The replicate with the least background was selected to complete our final panel of 20. ( Table S1 ).
All MACS2 narrow peaks with p value < 1E-9 were identified for the panel of 20 cell types. Peaks were extended by 300bp in either direction and then collapsed to create a consensus peak list used in subsequent analyses below.
Candidate outside variants were identified using ChIP-seq and Hi-C data from immune and neural cell types and further filtered based on genotype frequency and LD as detailed below ( Figure S1 ). Previously published MS risk SNPs (n = 163) were identified from the GWAS catalog (2/11/2018; ( Buniello et al., 2019 9. Buniello, A. ∙ MacArthur, J.A.L. ∙ Cerezo, M. ... The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog of published genome-wide association studies, targeted arrays and summary statistics 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D1005-D1012 Crossref Scopus (2450) PubMed Google Scholar ). GWAS SNPs and SNPs in LD with the lead SNP (r 2 > 0.8) were compared to promoter-centric Hi-C interactions identified in 15 immune cell types and NPCs (see Hi-C data analysis). Putative gene targets were defined as any promoter that physically associated with the GWAS SNPs (or LD SNPs r 2 > 0.8) in at least one cell type. All SNPs in Hi-C interactions with these putative gene targets were identified to define putative candidate outside variants. Candidate outside variants were filtered to include only those that were in sites enriched for H3K27ac in at least one of the 20 cell types included in our panel, defined by our consensus peak list (Curation of ChIP-seq panel).
This resulted in a list of candidate outside variants (n = 54,471) paired to a GWAS SNP based on shared physical interaction with the same target promoter. The candidate outside variant list was further filtered based on genotype frequency and LD with the GWAS SNP (described below). Nine possible genotype combinations are produced from each GWAS SNP + outside variant pair. The frequency of each genotype combination in the MS GWAS panel was quantified. Genotype combinations that were < 1% of cases or controls were excluded.
Additionally, only outside variants for which at least 6 of the 9 genotype combinations surpassed this frequency were considered. This filter enables exclusion of variants that are in strong LD with the GWAS SNP (note: if the GWAS SNP and outside variant were in perfect LD only 3 genotype combinations would be observed). After filtering, 48,455 outside variants remained across 126 GWAS loci. On average 560 outside variants were tested per GWAS SNP (range: 27-1,804 outside variants per GWAS SNP).
The impact of outside variants on clinical risk was evaluated as previously described ( Corradin et al., 2016 17. Corradin, O. ∙ Cohen, A.J. ∙ Luppino, J.M. ... Modeling disease risk through analysis of physical interactions between genetic variants within chromatin regulatory circuitry Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :1313-1320 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, individuals were stratified based on the genotype of the GWAS SNPs and then again by the genotype of the outside variant. This resulted in up to 9 possible genotype combinations ( Figure S1 ). Risk was calculated for each of these groups separately. To evaluate whether the change in odds ratio was significant, the outside variant was randomly permuted such that outside variant allele frequency remains constant and the impact of the GWAS SNP on risk remained unchanged. For example, if all individuals homozygous for the risk allele had an odds ratio of 1.1, permuting the outside variant (i.e., randomly segregating risk/risk individuals) would generate a null distribution of odds ratios with a median of approximately 1.1. This approach enables quantification of whether the observed impact of the outside variant genotype is more than expected by random chance. Each genotype combination was evaluated independently such that up to nine p values are generated per outside variant GWAS pair. This approach enables identification of outside variants that alter clinical risk beyond the effect of the primary GWAS SNP while being agnostic to the type of interaction between GWAS SNP and outside SNP (i.e., additive, epistatic, dominant interactions modes can all be identified using this method Figure S1 ).
An adaptive permutation approach was utilized to estimate p values and reduce the substantial computational burden of permutation-based tests. We calculated the 95% confidence interval for each p value iteratively at multiple steps through the permutation process. If the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval was below the p value threshold the genotype was defined as significant and no additional permutation were performed. If the lower bound of the confidence interval is above the p value threshold the genotype was defined as not significant. For all others, additional permutations were performed up to a maximum of 10 million permutations.
As each genotype combination is evaluated independently, multi-test correction accounted for the number of outside variants tested for each GWAS SNP and the total number of genotypes evaluated for each outside variant. For example, if all 9 genotype combinations were tested for 1,500 GWAS SNP-outside variants pairs then the p value threshold would be 0.05/(9 ∗ 1500) = 3.7E-6. The most stringent p value threshold was 3.9E-6
Outside variant results described above were incorporated with H3K27ac ChIP-seq data to identify likely pathogenic cell types for each GWAS risk locus. Outside variant results were segmented utilizing the ChIP-seq peaks from the consensus peak list as boundaries. The set of outside variants paired to each GWAS locus were evaluated separately. For each GWAS locus, all ChIP peaks containing at least one outside variant that significantly altered risk were defined as ‘sites that alter risk’ and peaks for which at least one outside variant was tested, but none were significant were classified as ‘sites that do not alter risk’ ( Figure S4 ). This strategy prevents overrepresentation of genomic regions with multiple outside variants. Additionally, it reduces the disproportional weighing of enhancer regions due to differences in LD without excluding the contribution of multiple functional variants in LD (as has been previously described in Canver et al., 2017; Corradin et al., 2014; Fortini et al., 2014; Glubb et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2015; He et al., 2015; Rajagopal et al., 2016 11.

H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal was quantified for each peak region in order to compare sites that alter risk to those that do not. ChIP signal was quantified in 40 equal sized bins ± 1500bp from the center of each peak from the consensus peak list. The median signal was extracted from wig files with step size of 10bp for each bin. The resulting matrix was then z-scored. For each GWAS locus, the signal across all sites that alter risk was aggregated by taking the average of each bin across the set of peaks. The average signal in each bin was also aggregated across sites that do not alter risk. One-sided Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to identify cell types in which H3K27ac signal at sites that alter risk was greater than the signal at sites that do not alter risk. This process was repeated for each cell type of interest. P values were multi-test corrected for the total number of GWAS SNPs (n = 126) and total number of cell type evaluated (n = 20) resulting in a threshold of p < 2E-5.
LDSR was utilized to estimate heritability enrichment across annotated SNP lists for (1) H3K27ac enriched sites found in each of the 20 cells in our panel ( Figure 1 C), (2) clusters of GWAS loci defined by outside variant cell type predictions ( Figure 1 D), and (3) transcriptional pausing pathway gene sets ( Figure 2 G). For each, European LD scores and weights were downloaded from the LDSC ( Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015 8. Bulik-Sullivan, B. ∙ Finucane, H.K. ∙ Anttila, V. ..., ReproGen Consortium, Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, Genetic Consortium for Anorexia Nervosa of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 An atlas of genetic correlations across human diseases and traits Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1236-1241 Crossref Scopus (2265) PubMed Google Scholar ). Formatted summary statistics for multiple sclerosis and 27 additional traits were obtained https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/sumstats_formatted/ . The GWA studies utilized are listed in Table S1 . For each SNP list of interest (detailed below) annotation-specific LD scores were calculated as recommended https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/ using HapMap3 SNPs and 1000 genomes phase 3 reference files ( Auton et al., 2015 4. Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ∙ Durbin, R.M. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (10727) PubMed Google Scholar ). Heritability enrichment calculations were conditioned on the recommended ‘baseline model’, comprised of multiple functional categories including conserved regions and multiple enhancer classifications.
Annotated SNP lists were defined as follows:
To estimate MS heritability enrichment in H3K27ac enriched sites found in each cell type, SNPs within ChIP-seq peaks identified by MACS2 with p < 1E-9 were utilized.
LDSR was also used to evaluate heritability enrichment across multiple diseases for the GWAS loci grouped by cell type prediction. SNPs within 250kb of each GWAS SNP within the outside variant defined cluster were utilized. The significance threshold was defined through Bonferroni multi-test correction (8 groups of GWAS loci, 28 disorders = 224 tests).
Two sets of gene list were generated to evaluate heritability enrichment of transcriptional elongation pathway. The first came from Reactome ( Fabregat et al., 2018 26. Fabregat, A. ∙ Jupe, S. ∙ Matthews, L. ... The Reactome pathway knowledgebase Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D649-D655 Crossref Scopus (1816) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene sets and their interactors (IntAct database; ( Hermjakob et al., 2004 44. Hermjakob, H. ∙ Montecchi-Palazzi, L. ∙ Lewington, C. ... IntAct: an open source molecular interaction database Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :D452-D455 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ); confidence score > 0.45) involved in pre-transcription events (ID:R-HSA-674695.3), transcription pre-initiation and promoter opening (ID:R-HSA-73779.2), transcription initiation and promoter clearance (ID: R-HSA-76042.3), RNAP II CTD phosphorylation and interaction with CE (ID:R-HSA-77075.2), and transcriptional elongation (ID:R-HSA-75955.2) were downloaded from Reactome. SNPs within 500kb of the TSSs of these gene sets were utilized. The second gene list was curated based on the gene ontology GO-0006368, “Transcription elongation from RNA polymerase II promoter” ( Ashburner et al., 2000 3. Ashburner, M. ∙ Ball, C.A. ∙ Blake, J.A. ..., The Gene Ontology Consortium Gene Ontology: tool for the unification of biology Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :25-29 Crossref Scopus (30809) PubMed Google Scholar ). This gene ontology adapted to include missing critical components for pause release regulation such as the 7SK complex which includes HEXIM1/2, LARP7 and RN7SK. These genes were supplemented to GO-0006368 and components involved in the assembly of RNAPII such as GTF2A1 were excluded. Each gene and the reason for its inclusion is listed in Table S4 . SNPs within 500kb of the TSSs of these gene sets were utilized.
Outside variants that significantly alter risk for the HEXIM1 , BRD3, and SOCS1 loci with robust H3K4me1/H3K27ac enrichment were selected. Single guide (sg) RNAs were designed using the CRISPOR online tool ( Haeussler et al., 2016 38. Haeussler, M. ∙ Schönig, K. ∙ Eckert, H. ... Evaluation of off-target and on-target scoring algorithms and integration into the guide RNA selection tool CRISPOR Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :148 Crossref Scopus (1101) PubMed Google Scholar )( Table S2 ). sgRNA oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP vector (PX458, Addgene plasmid #48138, Watertown, MA ( Ran et al., 2013 74. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cells were electroporated using the Neon Transfection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 30 μg of plasmid DNA and 2x10 6 cells were used per transfection for Jurkat cells, 20 μg plasmid DNA and 2x10 6 cells were used for GM12878 cells, and 30 μg plasmid DNA and 2.5x10 6 cells for NPCs. Jurkat and NPC parameters were: 1350 V, 10 ms, 3 pulses. GM12878 parameters were: 1150 V, 30 ms, 2 pulses. After transfection, Jurkat cells and GM12878 cells were incubated for 48 hours in maintenance media lacking penicillin-streptomycin. NPCs were incubated at 37°C at 5% CO 2 for 24 hours in supplemented maintenance media plus ROCK inhibitor lacking penicillin-streptomycin followed by 48 hours in supplemented maintenance media with penicillin-streptomycin after transfection. GFP+ cells were subsequently sorted via FACSAria II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Genomic DNA from at least 5x10 4 GFP+ cells was isolated and amplified using the GeneArt Genomic Cleavage Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; see Table S2 for primer sequences). Cleavage assays were performed as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Images were acquired using the Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR+ system and the Image Lab software. Non-overlapping PCR products were pooled for sequencing. CRISPResso tool was utilized to analyze indels generated by select sgRNAs ( Pinello et al., 2016 71. Pinello, L. ∙ Canver, M.C. ∙ Hoban, M.D. ... Analyzing CRISPR genome-editing experiments with CRISPResso Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :695-697 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ).
RNA was isolated from at least 3x10 5 GFP+ Jurkat cells, GM12878 cells, and NPCs using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and cDNA was generated using SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per the manufacturers’ protocols. qPCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with TaqMan probes ( Table S3 ) on the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fold change was determined using the ΔΔC T method, using samples transfected with Cas9 plasmid without a guide RNA as a comparator. Samples were run in technical triplicate or quadruplicate and the average result from each biological replicate is reported. Data was analyzed and visualized using GraphPad Prism 7.0.
Poly-D-lysine coated 384-well CellCarrier ultra plates (PerkinElmer) were coated with laminin (4 μg/mL). OPCs were plated at 1.25x10 4 per well in differentiation media (DMEM/F12; 1X N-2 high insulin supplement; 1X B-27 without vitamin A; 1X GlutaMAX; 100 ng/ml Noggin; 10 ng/ml NT-3; 50 μM cAMP; and 100 ng/ml IGF-1). Cells were left at room temperature for 45 minutes to attach before addition of drug. A library of 3,141 bioactive small molecules with well-annotated targets was added to the cells (columns 1-22, Figures S7 C and S7D) by pin transfer at a final concentration of 2 μM, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. 20 ng/ml FGF was added to negative control wells (column 24, Figures S7 C and S7D) and 40 ng/ml T3 to all other wells. T3 alone was used as a positive control (column 23, Figures S7 C and S7D). Cells were fixed and stained for oligodendrocyte lineage marker OLIG2 (MilliporeSigma), oligodendrocyte marker MBP (Abcam), and DAPI (MilliporeSigma) after 72 hours.
A total of 10 plates were utilized to assess the 3,141 compound library. All plates were processed simultaneously to reduce variability. Five 20X fields per well were captured using an Operetta high content imaging system (PerkinElmer). Harmony software (PerkinElmer) was used to identify nuclei using DAPI. Cells with nuclear OLIG2 staining and those with peri-nuclear MBP staining were counted in each well and percent positivity of each calculated. The percent MBP positive cells in each treatment was normalized to controls on a plate-by-plate basis. Compounds that were in the bottom 10% of the library for either total cell count or percent oligodendrocyte lineage (OLIG2+) cells were excluded. The median and standard deviation for each well position was calculated across the 10 plates to assess for well position effects as shown in Figure S7 . The standard deviation across different compounds in the same well position was similar across the plates. Some well-to-well variation in median MBP positive percentages was observed which could contribute to the false negative rate. The two percent of compounds that produced the smallest percent oligodendrocytes (MBP+) after these exclusions were selected for further analysis.
Cells were fixed for 15 minutes in fresh cold 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and permeabilized for 10 minutes with 0.2% Triton X-100 (MilliporeSigma) in pH 7.4 PBS. Blocking was performed for 1 hour with 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were incubated in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C, then washed with PBS. Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 and anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488; 1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were diluted in blocking solution and incubated on cells for 1 hour at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI in PBS for 5 minutes and then washed with PBS. Primary antibodies used were as follows: Sox10 (R&D Systems; 1:100), OLIG2 (MilliporeSigma; 1:1000), NF (Covance; 1:1000).
RNA from 1x10 6 cells was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by phase separation using Phase Lock tubes (5 Prime) and isolation with the miRNeasy kit (QIAGEN). Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit (Illumina) and sequenced on Illumina instruments at the Case Western Reserve University Genomics Core. Reads were aligned to the iGenomes mm9 build using Tophat ( Trapnell et al., 2010 80. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (11847) PubMed Google Scholar ). FPKMs were calculated using Cufflinks ( Trapnell et al., 2010 80. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (11847) PubMed Google Scholar ) then quantile normalized. FPKMs were floored to allow log transformations by replacing all values below FPKM = 0.25 with 0.25. Differential expression testing was performed using Cuffdiff ( Trapnell et al., 2010 80. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (11847) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Briefly, cells were crosslinked with 11% buffered formaldehyde (MilliporeSigma) and sonicated. Antibodies were incubated with Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before proceeding to immunoprecipitation. ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced on Illumina instruments at the Case Western Reserve University Genomics Core Facility. Adaptor sequence and quality trimming were performed using the FASTX-Toolkit. Reads were aligned to iGenomes mm9 builds using Bowtie ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 57. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ). Duplicate reads were removed using SAMtools ( Li et al., 2009 60. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38834) PubMed Google Scholar ) and peaks called using MACS using input DNA as control. Wiggle tracks generated by MACS were converted to BigWig using the UCSC Genome Browser’s wigToBigWig tool and visualized on the UCSC Genome Browser. Gene body read counts were generated for the region from 500bp downstream of the transcription start site to the transcription termination site using the annotatePeaks tool in the HOMER package ( Heinz et al., 2010 43.

CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) OPCs were generated following a similar protocol used previously ( Hubler et al., 2018; Tripathi et al., 2019 48. Hubler, Z. ∙ Allimuthu, D. ∙ Bederman, I. ...

Guide sequences for CRISPRa and CRISPRi were curated from the CRISPRa v2 and CRISPRi v2 libraries, respectively ( Horlbeck et al., 2016 46. Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Villalta, J.E. ... Compact and highly active next-generation libraries for CRISPR-mediated gene repression and activation eLife. 2016; 5 :e19760 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ). For CRISPRa, guides were cloned into the lentiSAMv2 backbone (Addgene plasmid #75112; ( Joung et al., 2017 53. Joung, J. ∙ Konermann, S. ∙ Gootenberg, J.S. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and transcriptional activation screening Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :828-863 Crossref Scopus (716) PubMed Google Scholar ). The activation helper plasmid lentiMPHv2 (Addgene plasmid #89308; ( Joung et al., 2017 53. Joung, J. ∙ Konermann, S. ∙ Gootenberg, J.S. ...

Guides for CRISPRi were cloned into the pLV hU6-sgRNA hUbC-dCas9-KRAB-T2a-Puro backbone (Addgene plasmid #71236; ( Joung et al., 2017 53. Joung, J. ∙ Konermann, S. ∙ Gootenberg, J.S. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and transcriptional activation screening Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :828-863 Crossref Scopus (716) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specific guides used in experiments are detailed in Table S3 . Plasmids used were confirmed to have the correct inserted oligomer using Sanger sequencing. Lentivirus was produced using Lenti-X Packaging Single Shots following the manufacturer’s protocol (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA). Lentiviral media was collected after 3 days, filtered, supplemented with OPC growth factors PDGF and FGF, and added to OPCs at a ratio of 1:2 viral media to growth media. After 24 hours of incubation with viral media, transduced cells were switched to fresh OPC growth media and allowed to recover for 48 hours. CRISPRa and NTC OPCs were then selected with a lethal dose of blasticidin (10 μg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and hygromycin (100 μg/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 96 hours. CRISPRi OPCs were selected by switching to OPC growth media supplemented with a lethal dose of puromycin (500 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 96 hours. OPCs were then allowed to recover for at least 24 hours following removal of selection and frozen down in aliquots for future use. For all experiments, the CRISPRa/i targeting and non-targeting OPCs were derived from the same batch of OPCs and infected and selected simultaneously.
qRT-PCR was performed to validate a reduction or overexpression of gene targets of interest compared to the non-targeting control. At least 10 6 OPCs were lysed in TRIzol reagent followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and processing with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was then generated using the iSCRIPT kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed using pre-designed TaqMan gene expression assays (Table S3; Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System and probes were normalized to the Rpl13a endogenous control.
HEXIM1/2 and BRD3 expression was analyzed using previously published microarray data ( Huynh et al., 2014 49. Huynh, J.L. ∙ Garg, P. ∙ Thin, T.H. ... Epigenome-wide differences in pathology-free regions of multiple sclerosis-affected brains Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :121-130 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, unidentified post-mortem brain frontal lobe specimens were obtained from the UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank. White matter regions from 13 controls and 12 MS patient lesions were evaluated. RMA normalization was utilized to quantify gene expression.
A rapid autopsy protocol was used to remove the brains within 6 hours post mortem. The brains were then sliced 1 cm thick and alternating sections were frozen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen 30 μm sections were cut for characterization by immunohistochemistry and for assessment of demyelination and other pathology using previously described protocols ( Dutta et al., 2006 25. Dutta, R. ∙ McDonough, J. ∙ Yin, X. ... Mitochondrial dysfunction as a cause of axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis patients Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59 :478-489 Crossref Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Patient demographics are listed in Table S4 . Sections were washed 3 times in PBS and then microwaved twice in 10 mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0; MilliporeSigma) for 5 minutes and allowed to cool to room temperature. The sections were then permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 minutes and then incubated with antibodies against HEXIM1 (Abcam) and PLP (produced in house at the Cleveland Clinic hybridoma facility) for 3 days followed by fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 and anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488) for 2 hours. PLP1 staining was utilized to identify oligodendrocyte lineage cells.
A total of 5 MS patients (2 primary progressive and 3 secondary progressive) and 3 controls were assessed (Table S6). MS patient lesions were randomly sampled in multiple regions of the forebrain. The number of HEXIM1+ cells counted from multiple 0.07 mm 2 areas from the samples are plotted in Figure 5 C.
Statistical details can be found in figure legends.
