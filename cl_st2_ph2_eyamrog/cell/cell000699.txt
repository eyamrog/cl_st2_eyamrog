Title: The gut-to-brain axis for toxin-induced defensive responses


Abstract: Summary

After ingestion of toxin-contaminated food, the brain initiates a series of defensive responses (e.g., nausea, retching, and vomiting). How the brain detects ingested toxin and coordinates diverse defensive responses remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a mouse-based paradigm to study defensive responses induced by bacterial toxins. Using this paradigm, we identified a set of molecularly defined gut-to-brain and brain circuits that jointly mediate toxin-induced defensive responses. The gut-to-brain circuit consists of a subset of Htr3a + vagal sensory neurons that transmit toxin-related signals from intestinal enterochromaffin cells to Tac1 + neurons in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Tac1 + DVC neurons drive retching-like behavior and conditioned flavor avoidance via divergent projections to the rostral ventral respiratory group and lateral parabrachial nucleus, respectively. Manipulating these circuits also interferes with defensive responses induced by the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. These results suggest that food poisoning and chemotherapy recruit similar circuit modules to initiate defensive responses.

Section: Introduction

Upon ingestion of food contaminated with bacterial toxin, the brain initiates a series of defensive responses ( Hernández-Cortez et al., 2017 29.

These responses include motor reflexes such as retching and vomiting, which promote expulsion of toxin from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as unpleasant sensation termed “nausea,” which serves as a teaching signal for conditioned flavor avoidance to prevent future ingestion of the same toxin ( Horn, 2008 32.

Paradoxically, these defensive responses for protecting the body from toxins are the main cause of severe side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs ( Hesketh, 2008 30. Hesketh, P.J. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358 :2482-2494 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The neurobiology of toxin-induced defensive responses has been intensively studied in the past several decades. Using emesis-competent animal models, studies suggest that a gut-to-brain axis is involved in toxin-induced nausea and vomiting ( Hornby, 2001 35. Hornby, P.J.

However, the mechanisms for this gut-to-brain axis remain elusive, with important questions to be answered. First, the key neuronal subtypes in the NTS and their efferent circuits to coordinate toxin-induced defensive responses remain uncharted. Second, the molecular identities and physiological properties of the vagal sensory neurons in this gut-to-brain axis are largely unknown. Third, the cellular processes in the gut critical for toxin-induced defensive responses are poorly understood.
These questions are difficult to answer, because traditional experimental paradigms for toxin-induced defensive responses are primarily based on emetic species ( King, 1990 44. King, G.L. Animal models in the study of vomiting Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 68 :260-268 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Laboratory mice are rarely used in such studies due to their lack of a vomiting response to emetic agents ( Horn et al., 2013 34. Horn, C.C. ∙ Kimball, B.A. ∙ Wang, H. ... Why can't rodents vomit? A comparative behavioral, anatomical, and physiological study PLoS One. 2013; 8 :e60537 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mice do exhibit conditioned flavor avoidance (CFA) ( Zhang et al., 2021 87. Zhang, C.C. ∙ Kaye, J.A. ∙ Cai, Z.R. ... Area postrema cell types that mediate nausea-associated behaviors Neuron. 2021; 109 :461-472.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) and potentially retching-like behavior ( Tanaka, 1955 75.

Ther. 1955; 113 :89-99 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Furukawa and Yamada, 1980 23. Furukawa, T. ∙ Yamada, K. The α-naphthoxyacetic acid-elicited retching involves dopaminergic inhibition in mice Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1980; 12 :735-738 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we developed the mouse-based experimental paradigm and thereby addressed the above three questions on the gut-to-brain axis for toxin-induced defensive responses in mice.

Section: Results

We used mice to develop a paradigm of toxin-induced defensive responses. Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), a type of exotoxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus , causes food poisoning in emetic species ( Argudín et al., 2010 3. Argudín, M.Á. ∙ Mendoza, M.C. ∙ Rodicio, M.R. Food poisoning and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins Toxins (Basel). 2010; 2 :1751-1773 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hu and Nakane, 2014 36. Hu, D.L. ∙ Nakane, A. Mechanisms of staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced emesis Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 722 :95-107 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). After intraperitoneal injection of SEA (0.3 mg/kg), mouse behavior was monitored for 3 h ( Figure 1 A). We observed unusual mouth-opening actions in all SEA-treated mice (10/10, latency = 87 ± 14 min) but not in those treated with saline ( Figures 1 B and S1 A; Video S1 ). To characterize the mouth-opening actions, we measured the angle of open mouth ( Figure S1 B) and plotted its time course ( Figure 1 C). In SEA-treated mice, the “open” phase of mouth-opening action was defined as the time range when the open angle was above 0.1× peak angle ( Figure 1 C). We quantified the peak angle and duration of mouth-opening actions in saline- and SEA-treated mice. The saline-treated mice occasionally exhibited spontaneous mouth-opening actions, with small amplitude (9 ± 1 deg) and short duration (185 ± 7 ms) ( Figure S1 C). The mouth-opening actions in SEA-treated mice were divided into two clusters ( Figure S1 D). One cluster of actions resembled the spontaneous mouth-opening actions in saline-treated mice (amplitude: 10 ± 1 deg; duration: 193 ± 10 ms), whereas the other cluster exhibited larger amplitude (76 ± 5 deg) and longer duration (1,063 ± 63 ms) ( Figure S1 D).

SEA-induced retching-like behavior, related to Figure 1 Movie S1 shows SEA-induced retching-like behavior in a wild-type mouse.
The SEA-induced unusual mouth-opening actions were reminiscent of “retching in mice” in early studies ( Tanaka, 1955 75. Tanaka, K. Studies on veratrum alkaloids. 20. Actions of veratrum alkaloids upon the central nervous system of mice J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1955; 113 :89-99 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Furukawa and Yamada, 1980 23. Furukawa, T. ∙ Yamada, K. The α-naphthoxyacetic acid-elicited retching involves dopaminergic inhibition in mice Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1980; 12 :735-738 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). In emetic species, retching is physiologically characterized by synchronous activation of diaphragm (inspiratory) and abdominal (expiratory) muscles ( Miller, 1990 56. Miller, A.D. Respiratory muscle control during vomiting Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 68 :237-241 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recorded the activities of these muscles in mice and found that SEA-induced mouth-opening action was accompanied by synchronous bursting-like electromyogram (EMG) activities of diaphragm and abdominal external oblique muscles ( Figure 1 D, top). In control mice, normal ventilation paralleled with the alternating EMG activities of these muscles ( Figure 1 D, bottom). In SEA-treated mice, both diaphragm EMG amplitude and frequency during “open” phase were significantly higher than those during “closed” phase of mouth-opening actions ( Figures 1 E and 1F). These data provide physiological evidence that the SEA-induced unusual mouth-opening actions in mice are retching-like behavior.
To further study retching-like behavior, we performed two control experiments. The gaping response evoked by intraoral delivery of bitter stimulus (e.g., quinine) also involves mouth-opening actions ( Grill and Norgren, 1978 24. Grill, H.J. ∙ Norgren, R. The taste reactivity test. I. Mimetic responses to gustatory stimuli in neurologically normal rats Brain Res. 1978; 143 :263-279 Crossref Scopus (923) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the peak angle of open mouth in SEA-induced retching-like behavior was significantly higher than that in quinine-induced gaping response, suggesting that retching-like behavior differs from gaping response ( Figure S1 E). During SEA-induced retching-like behavior, the mice did not exhibit sonic or ultrasonic vocalization, suggesting that retching-like behavior is not involved in vocalization ( Figure S1 F).
We next explored whether retching-like behavior in mice can be evoked by various emetic agents. Different Staphylococcal enterotoxins (A, B, C1, D, E, and H) can induce vomiting in emetic species ( Hu et al., 2003 37. Hu, D.L. ∙ Omoe, K. ∙ Shimoda, Y. ... Induction of emetic response to staphylococcal enterotoxins in the house musk shrew ( Suncus murinus ) Infect. Immun. 2003; 71 :567-570 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that mice displayed retching-like behavior to these enterotoxins, with the time spent in mouth-opening actions dependent on the dose of each enterotoxin ( Figures 1 G and S1 G). They also exhibited retching-like behavior in response to other emetics, such as protoveratrine A and copper sulfate ( Figures S1 H and S1I).
We then tested whether SEA induces CFA that reflects “nausea” ( Chambers, 2018 15. Chambers, K.C. Conditioned taste aversions World J. Otorhinolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 2018; 4 :92-100 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2021 87. Zhang, C.C. ∙ Kaye, J.A. ∙ Cai, Z.R. ... Area postrema cell types that mediate nausea-associated behaviors Neuron. 2021; 109 :461-472.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). We developed a paradigm for SEA-induced CFA ( Figures 1 H and 1I) and calculated the CFA index, defined as the time for drinking the conditioned flavor divided by total time for drinking. We found that SEA treatment induced CFA in a dose-dependent manner in mice ( Figure 1 J).
Next, we examined whether SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA share similar pharmacological properties with toxin-induced vomiting in emetic species ( Rojas et al., 2014 67. Rojas, C. ∙ Raje, M. ∙ Tsukamoto, T. ... Molecular mechanisms of 5-HT(3) and NK(1) receptor antagonists in prevention of emesis Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 722 :26-37 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intraperitoneal pretreatment with CP-99994, an anti-emetic NK 1 R antagonist ( Rudd et al., 1996 69. Rudd, J.A. ∙ Jordan, C.C. ∙ Naylor, R.J. The action of the NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist, CP 99,994, in antagonizing the acute and delayed emesis induced by cisplatin in the ferret Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119 :931-936 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ), reduced SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA ( Figure 1 K). The 5-HT 3 R antagonist granisetron ( Reynolds et al., 1991 66. Reynolds, D.J. ∙ Barber, N.A. ∙ Grahame-Smith, D.G. ... Cisplatin-evoked induction of c-fos protein in the brainstem of the ferret: the effect of cervical vagotomy and the anti-emetic 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron (BRL 43694) Brain Res. 1991; 565 :231-236 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) also impaired SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA ( Figure 1 L). These data suggest that SEA induces defensive responses that depend on NK 1 R- and 5-HT 3 R-mediated signaling in mice. Thus, we used this experimental paradigm to explore the mechanisms underpinning toxin-induced defensive responses in mice.
Previous studies on emetic species suggest that the vagus nerve is critical for toxin-induced emesis ( Reynolds et al., 1991 66. Reynolds, D.J. ∙ Barber, N.A. ∙ Grahame-Smith, D.G. ... Cisplatin-evoked induction of c-fos protein in the brainstem of the ferret: the effect of cervical vagotomy and the anti-emetic 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron (BRL 43694) Brain Res. 1991; 565 :231-236 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fukui et al., 1992 22. Fukui, H. ∙ Yamamoto, M. ∙ Sato, S. Vagal afferent fibers and peripheral 5-HT3 receptors mediate cisplatin-induced emesis in dogs Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 59 :221-226 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mutoh et al., 1992 59. Mutoh, M. ∙ Imanishi, H. ∙ Torii, Y. ... Cisplatin-induced emesis in Suncus murinus Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 58 :321-324 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hu et al., 2007 38. Hu, D.L. ∙ Zhu, G. ∙ Mori, F. ... Staphylococcal enterotoxin induces emesis through increasing serotonin release in intestine and it is downregulated by cannabinoid receptor 1 Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9 :2267-2277 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly impaired SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA in mice ( Figure 1 M). The brain area targeted by the vagal afferents is the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) in the medulla, which includes the NTS, area postrema (AP), and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). To examine the functional relevance of DVC neurons in SEA-induced defensive responses, we employed the FosTRAP2 strategy to genetically label neurons activated by SEA treatment ( Figure S1 J). FosTRAP2 (Fos-2A-CreERT2) was designed to express a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase in neurons that are activated during specific behaviors ( Allen et al., 2017 1. Allen, W.E. ∙ DeNardo, L.A. ∙ Chen, M.Z. ... Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive Science. 2017; 357 :1149-1155 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). In SEA-TRAP mice, abundant DVC neurons were labeled with hM4Di-mCherry (2,241 ± 366 cells, 9 mice); in Saline-TRAP mice (control), DVC neurons were rarely labeled (114 ± 12, 9 mice) ( Figures S1 K and S1L).
To examine the specificity and efficiency of hM4Di-mCherry labeling, we stained Fos and mCherry in the DVC of SEA-TRAP mice ( Figures 1 N and 1O). A large proportion of mCherry+ cells (76% ± 5.8%, 9 mice) were positive for Fos, and most Fos+ cells (86% ± 6.9%, 9 mice) were positive for mCherry ( Figures 1 P and 1Q). Chemogenetic inactivation of these neurons with an intraperitoneal clozapine N-oxide (CNO, 1 mg/kg) impaired SEA-induced retching-like behavior ( Figure 1 R) and CFA ( Figure 1 S). These data suggest a gut-to-brain axis for SEA-induced defensive responses in mice.
A recent study using single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed that genes encoding neuropeptides are abundantly expressed in the DVC ( Ludwig et al., 2021 51. Ludwig, M.Q. ∙ Cheng, W. ∙ Gordian, D. ... A genetic map of the mouse dorsal vagal complex and its role in obesity Nat. Metab. 2021; 3 :530-545 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we confirmed the expression of several neuropeptide-encoding genes in the DVC, including preprotachykinin 1 ( Tac1 : Figure 2 A), neuropeptide Y ( Npy : Figure S2 A), and cholecystokinin ( Cck : Figure S2 B). We quantified the spatial distributions of neurons expressing these genes in the DVC ( Tac1 : Figures 2 B and 2C; Npy : Figures S2 C and S2D; Cck : Figures S2 E and S2F). About 1,600 Tac1 + neurons were detected in the DVC, mostly in the NTS (91% ± 6.9%, 5 mice) rather than the AP (5.4% ± 1.2%) or DMV (3.6% ± 0.7%) ( Figure 2 B). Tac1+ neurons were broadly distributed in the rostral, intermediate, and caudal parts of NTS ( Figure 2 C). At 3 h after SEA treatment, a considerable proportion (36% ± 6.2%, 3 mice) of Tac1+ neurons expressed Fos, an indicator of neuronal activation ( Figures 2 D, S2 G, and S2H). Considering that Tac1 encodes tachykinin neuropeptides that bind to NK 1 R ( Krause et al., 1992 47. Krause, J.E. ∙ Takeda, Y. ∙ Hershey, A.D. Structure, functions, and mechanisms of substance P receptor action J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98 :2S-7S Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cao et al., 1998 13.

Primary afferent tachykinins are required to experience moderate to intense pain Nature. 1998; 392 :390-394 Crossref Scopus (519) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the functional importance of NK 1 R in vomiting ( Rudd et al., 1996 69. Rudd, J.A. ∙ Jordan, C.C. ∙ Naylor, R.J. The action of the NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist, CP 99,994, in antagonizing the acute and delayed emesis induced by cisplatin in the ferret Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119 :931-936 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rojas et al., 2014 67. Rojas, C. ∙ Raje, M. ∙ Tsukamoto, T. ... Molecular mechanisms of 5-HT(3) and NK(1) receptor antagonists in prevention of emesis Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 722 :26-37 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that Tac1+ DVC neurons may participate in SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA.
To test this hypothesis, we examined whether Tac1 + DVC neurons are required for SEA-induced defensive responses. We injected AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry ( Armbruster et al., 2007 4. Armbruster, B.N. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Pausch, M.H. ... Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :5163-5168 Crossref Scopus (1481) PubMed Google Scholar ) or AAV-DIO-mCherry (as control) into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice ( Figure 2 E) and validated the specific expression of hM4Di-mCherry in Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Cells in the nodose ganglion (NG) were rarely retrogradely labeled with hM4Di-mCherry ( Figure S 2I). The effectiveness of CNO to chemogenetically suppress the firing of action potentials in Tac1 + DVC neurons was confirmed in a control experiment ( Figure 2 H). We found that chemogenetic inactivation of Tac1 + DVC neurons impaired SEA-induced retching-like behavior ( Figure 2 I) and CFA ( Figure 2 J). However, inactivation of Tac1+ DVC neurons did not alter CFA induced by lithium chloride (LiCl) ( Figures S2 J–S2L), suggesting that they selectively participate in SEA-induced defensive responses. Using Npy-IRES-Cre and Cck-IRES-Cre mice, we examined whether Npy + and Cck + DVC neurons are required for SEA-induced defensive responses. Chemogenetic inactivation of Npy + and Cck + DVC neurons ( Npy +: Figures S2 N–S2Q; Cck +: Figures S2 R–S2U) did not significantly impair SEA-induced retching-like behavior ( Figures 2 K and 2M) and CFA ( Figures 2 L and 2N). These data suggest that Tac1 + DVC neurons may be an important component in the central circuit module required for SEA-induced defensive responses in mice.
We next examined the neurotransmitters released by Tac1 + DVC neurons. We injected AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry ( Boyden et al., 2005 11. Boyden, E.S. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ Bamberg, E. ... Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8 :1263-1268 Crossref Scopus (3720) PubMed Google Scholar ) into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice and found that most mCherry+ DVC neurons were positive for Slc17a6 mRNA (94% ± 8%, 5 mice) and negative for Slc32a1 mRNA (93% ± 7%, 5 mice) ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). In acute brain slices containing Tac1 + DVC neurons expressing ChR2-mCherry, light-evoked postsynaptic currents recorded from ChR2-negative neurons were blocked by APV and CNQX but not by the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PTX) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) ( Figures 3 B and 3C). These data suggest that Tac1 + DVC neurons release glutamate rather than GABA.
To further test the neurotransmitter release of Tac1 + DVC neurons, we applied repetitive light pulses while blocking glutamatergic currents with APV and CNQX. Repetitive light pulses (10 Hz, 2 ms, 6 pulses) evoked a slow inward current from ChR2-negative neurons (rise time = 11.3 ± 3.2 ms, 9 cells), which was significantly reduced by perfusion of GR82334 (5 μM), an antagonist of NK 1 R ( Figures 3 D and 3E). These data suggest that Tac1 + DVC neurons may release both glutamate and Tac1 -encoded neuropeptides ( Figure 3 F).
To test the contribution of Tac1 -encoded neuropeptides to SEA-induced defensive responses, we injected AAV-EGFP-2A-Cre into the DVC of Tac1 f/f or Tac1 +/+ mice (control) ( Figure 3 G). This genetic manipulation, resulting in ablation of Tac1 gene expression ( Figures 3 H and 3I) without altering the expression of Slc17a6 in the DVC ( Figure S3 B), significantly impaired SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA ( Figures 3 M and 3N).
To measure how glutamate release from Tac1 + DVC neurons contributes to SEA-induced defensive responses, we generated Tac1-IRES-Flp mice ( Figures S3 C and S3D) that enabled us to use an intersectional strategy to specifically delete Slc17a6 in Tac1 + DVC neurons. To validate the specificity and efficiency of this Flp line, we injected AAV-fDIO-EGFP in the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Flp mice. EGFP+ DVC neurons were predominantly positive for Tac1 mRNA (82% ± 5%, 3 mice), while Tac1 + DVC neurons were mostly positive for EGFP (86% ± 8%, 3 mice) ( Figure S3 E). We crossed this line with Slc17a6 f/f mice ( Tong et al., 2007 78. Tong, Q.C. ∙ Ye, C.P. ∙ McCrimmon, R.J. ... Synaptic glutamate release by ventromedial hypothalamic neurons is part of the neurocircuitry that prevents hypoglycemia Cell Metab. 2007; 5 :383-393 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate Tac1-IRES-Flp; Slc17a6 f/f mice, then injected AAV-fDIO-EGFP-2A-Cre into the DVC of these mice ( Figure 3 J). This intersectional strategy resulted in ablation of Slc17a6 expression in Tac1 + DVC neurons (EGFP+) ( Figures 3 K and 3L) without altering the expression of Tac1 in the DVC ( Figure S3 F). We found that deletion of Slc17a6 in Tac1 + DVC neurons impaired SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA ( Figures 3 O and 3P). These data suggest that both glutamate and Tac1 -encoded neuropeptides released by Tac1 + DVC neurons participate in the regulation of SEA-induced defensive responses in mice.
To map the gut-to-brain circuit that monosynaptically innervates Tac1 + DVC neurons, we performed retrograde tracing with recombinant rabies virus (RV) ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and S4 A–S4C) ( Wickersham et al., 2007 82. Wickersham, I.R. ∙ Finke, S. ∙ Conzelmann, K.K. ... Retrograde neuronal tracing with a deletion-mutant rabies virus Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :47-49 Crossref Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that Tac1 + DVC neurons were monosynaptically innervated by the ipsilateral vagal sensory neurons ( Figure 4 C) and several brain areas ( Figures S4 D and S4E). These areas included the central amygdaloid nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, parasubthalamic nucleus, and areas in the pons and medulla of the hind brain ( Figures S4 D1–S4D5).
We next characterized the projections of RV-labeled vagal sensory neurons (EGFP+) in the gastrointestinal tract ( Berthoud et al., 2004 10. Berthoud, H.R. ∙ Blackshaw, L.A. ∙ Brookes, S.J. ... Neuroanatomy of extrinsic afferents supplying the gastrointestinal tract Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2004; 16 :28-33 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ). The axons of these EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons rarely formed intraganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs) with neurons (NeuN+) in the gastrointestinal tract ( Figures S4 F and S4G) or innervated intestinal crypts ( Figures S4 H and S4I). However, they formed mucosal endings that terminated primarily in the villi of antrum of stomach and proximal segments (0–3 cm, 3–10 cm) of small intestine ( Figures 4 D and 4E). The mucosal endings in the intestinal villi of EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons were in proximity to 5-HT+ EC cells ( Figure 4 F), a type of enteroendocrine cells that release 5-HT ( Mawe and Hoffman, 2013 54. Mawe, G.M. ∙ Hoffman, J.M. Serotonin signalling in the gut--functions, dysfunctions and therapeutic targets Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10 :473-486 Crossref Scopus (795) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bellono et al., 2017 9. Bellono, N.W. ∙ Bayrer, J.R. ∙ Leitch, D.B. ... Enterochromaffin cells are gut chemosensors that couple to sensory neural pathways Cell. 2017; 170 :185-198.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (555) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation prompted us to wonder whether EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons respond to 5-HT.
To test this possibility, we performed FISH and found that a large proportion of EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons were positive for Htr3a mRNA (65% ± 7%, 5 mice) rather than Htr1a mRNA (12% ± 6%, 5 mice) or Cckar mRNA (14% ± 5%, 5 mice) ( Figures 4 G–4I and S4 J–S4L). For functional analyses, we acutely dissociated these EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons and recorded postsynaptic currents evoked by puff-application of different reagents ( Figure 4 J). Strikingly, 5-HT but not CCK-8 selectively evoked an inward current from the acutely dissociated EGFP+ neurons (12 cells) ( Figure 4 K). The inward currents evoked by 5-HT were blocked by 5-HT 3 R antagonist ondansetron (12 cells) ( Figure 4 L). These data suggest that the EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons that monosynaptically innervate Tac1 + DVC neurons may respond to 5-HT released by EC cells.
As gut chemosensors that couple to sensory neural pathways ( Bellono et al., 2017 9. Bellono, N.W. ∙ Bayrer, J.R. ∙ Leitch, D.B. ... Enterochromaffin cells are gut chemosensors that couple to sensory neural pathways Cell. 2017; 170 :185-198.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (555) PubMed Google Scholar ), EC cells have been implicated in rotavirus-induced nausea and vomiting in emetic species ( Hagbom et al., 2011 26. Hagbom, M. ∙ Istrate, C. ∙ Engblom, D. ... Rotavirus stimulates release of serotonin (5-HT) from human enterochromaffin cells and activates brain structures involved in nausea and vomiting PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7 :e1002115 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, evidence regarding their causal role in toxin-induced defensive responses is still lacking. To examine the role of EC cells in SEA-induced defensive responses, we generated Vil1-Cre; Tph1 f/f mice, in which Tph1 is deleted in villus and crypt epithelial cells of the small and large intestines ( Madison et al., 2002 53. Madison, B.B. ∙ Dunbar, L. ∙ Qiao, X.T. ... Cis elements of the villin gene control expression in restricted domains of the vertical (crypt) and horizontal (duodenum, cecum) axes of the intestine J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :33275-33283 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (623) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tph1 is the gene that encodes tryptophan hydroxylase 1 for synthesis of 5-HT in EC cells. This genetic manipulation ablated 5-HT synthesis in the EC cells and impaired SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA ( Figures 4 M–4O). As a control, deletion of Tph2 in Vil1-Cre; Tph2 f/f mice did not alter 5-HT synthesis in EC cells and did not significantly change SEA-induced defensive responses ( Figures S4 M–S4O). Ablation of 5-HT synthesis in the EC cells did not impaired LiCl-induced CFA ( Figure S2 M), suggesting intestinal EC cells selectively participate in SEA-induced defensive responses.
To further explore the role of 5-HT in SEA-induced defensive responses, we tested whether fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, would regulate SEA-induced retching-like behavior ( Figure S4 P). Fluoxetine treatment alone did not evoke retching ( Figure S4 Q). However, pretreatment of fluoxetine promoted SEA-induced retching-like behavior ( Figures S4 Q–S4S), suggesting that a rapid reuptake of 5-HT may be involved in the regulation of SEA-induced defensive responses.
Together, these data suggest that Tac1 + DVC neurons are monosynaptically innervated by a subset of Htr3a+ vagal sensory neurons that functionally connect Tac1 + DVC neurons to intestinal EC cells, thus forming a molecularly defined gut-to-brain circuit to mediate SEA-induced defensive responses.
To examine how this gut-to-brain circuit conveys neural signals to Tac1 + DVC neurons, we expressed jGCaMP7s in these neurons ( Figures 5 A and 5B) and monitored GCaMP fluorescence with fiber photometry in SEA-treated mice ( Figure 5 C). When the mice exhibited SEA-induced retching-like behavior, we observed a transient increase in GCaMP fluorescence in Tac1 + DVC neurons, as measured by normalizing the change of GCaMP fluorescence (ΔF/F) ( Figure 5 D). The increase in GCaMP fluorescence was not a motion artifact, as fluorescence in the EGFP-expressing Tac1 + DVC neurons did not change during retching-like behavior ( Figures S5 A–S5C). The increase in GCaMP fluorescence was specific for retching-like behavior, as GCaMP fluorescence did not significantly change during normal ventilation in SEA-treated mice ( Figures S5 D–S5F).
To examine the temporal relationship between GCaMP signals and retching-like behavior, we aligned the GCaMP-signal episodes in individual trials to the onset of retching-like behavior ( Figure 5 E) and plotted the average curve ( Figure 5 F). The onset of retching-like behavior was defined as the time when the angle of mouth-opening action reaches 0.1× peak angle (see also Figure 1 C). We defined the onset of GCaMP signal as the time when the signal reached 15% of peak amplitude relative to baseline. The average GCaMP signal started to rise ∼49 ms before the onset of retching-like behavior (49 ± 9 ms, 7 mice) ( Figure 5 F). Then we examined whether Tac1+ DVC neurons encode the amplitude and duration of SEA-induced retching-like behavior, by correlating the peak mouth-opening angle with the peak GCaMP response of these neurons. We found a correlation (R = 0.725) between the peak angle of retching and the peak GCaMP response of Tac1+ DVC neurons ( Figure S5 G). Similarly, the duration of retching and the peak GCaMP response were also correlated (R = 0.853) ( Figure S5 H). These data suggest that Tac1 + DVC neurons encode the amplitude and duration of retching-like behavior.
We then examined whether retching-correlated GCaMP signals were transmitted by vagal sensory neurons from the gut to Tac1 + DVC neurons. Both subdiaphragmatic vagotomy and pretreatment of HT 3 R antagonist granisetron dampened the transient increase of GCaMP fluorescence in Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Quantitative analyses indicated that vagotomy and granisetron significantly decreased the amplitude of GCaMP signals ( Figure 5 I). However, these manipulations did not change the onset of transient increase in GCaMP fluorescence ( Figure 5 J). These data suggest that retching-correlated GCaMP signals are transmitted by vagal sensory neurons from the gut to Tac1 + DVC neurons.
We next examined whether activation of Tac1 + DVC neurons is sufficient to induce retching-like behavior and CFA in mice. To optogenetically activate Tac1+ DVC neurons, we injected AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry in the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice, followed by optical fiber implantation above the DVC ( Figure S5 L). In acute slices, light pulses reliably evoked APs in ChR2-expressing Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Figure S5 M). Optogenetic activation of Tac1+ DVC neurons induced retching-like behavior that was temporally locked with light pulses ( Figures S5 N and S5O; Video S2 ). The time spent in light-evoked retching-like behavior depends on the frequency and laser power of light stimulation ( Figures S5 P and S5Q).

Optogenetically evoked retching-like behavior, related to Figure 5 Movie S2 shows that optogenetic activation of Tac1 + DVC neurons evoked phase-locked retching-like behavior in an example mouse.
To chemogenetically activate Tac1+ DVC neurons, we injected AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice, resulting in specific expression of hM3Dq-mCherry in Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Figures 5 K–5M). Cells in the NG were rarely retrogradely labeled with hM3Dq-mCherry ( Figure S5 R). The effectiveness of CNO to evoke action potential firing in hM3Dq-mCherry+ neurons was validated ( Figure 5 N). Intraperitoneal CNO (1 mg/kg) to activate Tac1 + DVC neurons induced intermittent mouth-opening actions ( Figure 5 O; Video S3 ). These actions were accompanied by synchronized EMGs of the diaphragm and abdominal external oblique muscles, a physiological characteristic of retching in emetic species ( Figure 5 P). The time spent in chemogenetically evoked retching-like behavior was significantly higher than that in control mice ( Figure 5 Q). Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of Tac1 + DVC neurons also induced CFA ( Figure 5 R). These data suggest that activation of Tac1 + DVC neurons is sufficient to induce defensive responses in mice.

Chemogenetically evoked retching-like behavior, related to Figure 5 Movie S3 shows that chemogenetic activation of Tac1 + DVC neurons evoked retching-like behavior in an example mouse.
Next, we mapped the projections of Tac1 + DVC neurons by injecting AAV-DIO-EGFP into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice ( Figure 6 A). The EGFP-expressing Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Figure 6 B, left) projected to the ipsilateral rostral part of the ventral respiratory group (rVRG) in the ventrolateral medulla ( Figure 6 B, middle), lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB) in the pons ( Figure 6 B, right), and other brain areas ( Figure S6 A). Using a dual AAV2-retro strategy ( Tervo et al., 2016 77. Tervo, D.G. ∙ Hwang, B.Y. ∙ Viswanathan, S. ... A designer AAV variant permits efficient retrograde access to projection neurons Neuron. 2016; 92 :372-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (809) PubMed Google Scholar ), we labeled rVRG-projecting and LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons with mCherry and EGFP, respectively ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Quantitative analyses indicated that very few Tac1 + DVC neurons were dually labeled with mCherry and EGFP ( Figure 6 E), suggesting that rVRG- and LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons are spatially segregated.
We then explored the functional importance of these two subsets of Tac1 + DVC neurons. In the rVRG of emetic species, respiratory bulbospinal neurons fire synchronously with retching and vomiting ( Miller et al., 1987 57. Miller, A.D. ∙ Tan, L.K. ∙ Suzuki, I. Control of abdominal and expiratory intercostal muscle activity during vomiting: role of ventral respiratory group expiratory neurons J. Neurophysiol. 1987; 57 :1854-1866 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koga, 1991 46. Koga, T. Discharge patterns of bulbar respiratory neurons during retching and vomiting in decerebrate dogs Jpn. J. Physiol. 1991; 41 :233-249 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the LPB is implicated in aversive taste memories ( Chen et al., 2018 17. Chen, J.Y. ∙ Campos, C.A. ∙ Jarvie, B.C. ... Parabrachial CGRP neurons establish and sustain aversive taste memories Neuron. 2018; 100 :891-899.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies suggest that rVRG- and LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons may be involved in SEA-induced retching and CFA, respectively. To test this hypothesis, we bilaterally injected AAV2-retro-DIO-Flp into the rVRG and AAV-fDIO-hM3Dq-mCherry into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice ( Figure 6 F). The specificity of this intersectional strategy was validated in control experiments ( Figures S6 B–S6E). This strategy resulted in hM3Dq-mCherry expression in Tac1 + DVC neurons that selectively project to the rVRG rather than the LPB ( Figure S6 F). Chemogenetic activation of rVRG-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons selectively evoked retching-like behavior without inducing CFA ( Figures 6 G and 6H). To further test the hypothesis, we injected AAV2-retro-DIO-Flp into the LPB and AAV-fDIO-hM3Dq-mCherry into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice ( Figure 6 I), resulting in hM3Dq-mCherry expression in LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Figure S6 G). Chemogenetic activation of LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons did not evoke retching-like behavior but induced CFA ( Figures 6 J and 6K). These findings suggest that activation of rVRG- and LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons selectively evokes retching-like behavior and CFA, respectively.
We next tested the roles of rVRG-projecting and LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons in SEA-induced defensive responses. We bilaterally injected AAV2-retro-DIO-Flp into the rVRG and AAV-fDIO-hM4Di-mCherry into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice ( Figure 6 L). Chemogenetic inactivation of rVRG-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons selectively impaired SEA-induced retching-like behavior without preventing CFA ( Figures 6 M and 6N). With a similar strategy, we injected AAV2-retro-DIO-Flp into the LPB, followed by injection of AAV-fDIO-hM4Di-mCherry into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice ( Figure 6 O). Chemogenetic inactivation of LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons did not impair SEA-induced retching-like behavior but prevented SEA-induced CFA ( Figures 6 P and 6Q). These data suggest that rVRG- and LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons are selectively required for SEA-induced retching-like behavior and CFA, respectively.
In addition to toxin-contaminated food, chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., cisplatin and doxorubicin) also induce strong defensive responses (e.g., nausea, retching, and vomiting) in cancer patients ( Hesketh, 2008 30. Hesketh, P.J. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358 :2482-2494 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that intraperitoneal cisplatin effectively induced CFA, but only slightly evoked retching-like behavior in mice ( Figures S6 H and S6I). In contrast, intraperitoneal doxorubicin was more effective at simultaneously inducing retching-like behavior and CFA ( Figures S6 J and S6K). Thus, we examined whether Tac1 + DVC neurons participate in defensive responses induced by doxorubicin.
Chemogenetic inactivation of Tac1 + DVC neurons significantly reduced doxorubicin-induced defensive responses ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Deletion of the Tac1 gene in the DVC ( Figures 7 C and 7D) or deletion of Slc17a6 in Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Figures 7 E and 7F) also significantly impaired doxorubicin-induced defensive responses. Ablation of 5-HT synthesis in EC cells by deleting Tph1 in Vil1+ intestinal epithelial cells also significantly impaired doxorubicin-induced defensive responses ( Figures 7 G and 7H). Chemogenetic inactivation of rVRG-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons selectively impaired doxorubicin-induced retching-like behavior rather than CFA ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Chemogenetic inactivation of LPB-projecting Tac1 + DVC neurons selectively impaired doxorubicin-induced CFA rather than retching-like behavior ( Figures 7 K and 7L). These data suggest that Tac1 + DVC neurons identified in this study may also play an important role in chemotherapy-induced defensive responses in mice.
Finally, we examined how SEA and doxorubicin recruit the gut-to-brain circuit identified in this study. Intragastrically applied SEA or doxorubicin by gavage also evoked retching-like behavior ( Figures S7 A and S7B) and CFA ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Moreover, these defensive responses were significantly impaired by chemogenetic inactivation of Tac1+ DVC neurons ( Figures S7 E and S7F) and deletion of Tph1 in Vil1+ intestinal epithelial cells ( Figures S7 G and S7H). These data support the model that the intestinal EC cells and Tac1+ DVC neurons are critical for defensive responses to “ingested” toxins.
We wondered how luminal toxins recruit the gut-to-brain circuit to evoke defensive responses in mice. It is likely that SEA and doxorubicin may directly activate NG neurons or enteric EC cells. To test this possibility, we puffed SEA or doxorubicin while performing whole-cell recording from the dissociated NG neurons. Neither SEA nor doxorubicin evoked APs in these dissociated neurons; as positive control, puff-application of 4-AP reliably evoked APs in the same recorded neurons ( Figures S7 I and S7J). Furthermore, puff-application of SEA or doxorubicin failed to evoked APs in CFP+ EC cells dissociated from Tph1-CFP mice ( Knutson et al., 2018 45. Knutson, K. ∙ Strege, P.R. ∙ Li, J. ... Whole cell electrophysiology of primary cultured murine enterochromaffin cells J. Vis. Exp. 2018; 139 :58112 Google Scholar ) ( Figures S7 K and S7L). These data suggest that SEA and doxorubicin may not directly activate NG neurons or intestinal EC cells. Consistent with these in vitro data, intragastric application of SEA did not induce immediate GCaMP responses from Tac1+ DVC neurons in vivo ( Figures S5 I–S5K).
Then we tested whether SEA and doxorubicin indirectly recruit the gut-to-brain circuit. It was shown that SEA causes inflammatory injury in the gastrointestinal tract of human ( Banwell and Sherr, 1973 7. Banwell, J.G. ∙ Sherr, H. Effect of bacterial enterotoxins on the gastrointestinal tract Gastroenterology. 1973; 65 :467-497 Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) and rodents ( Beery et al., 1984 8. Beery, J.T. ∙ Taylor, S.L. ∙ Schlunz, L.R. ... Effects of staphylococcal enterotoxin A on the rat gastrointestinal tract Infect. Immun. 1984; 44 :234-240 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2022 49. Liu, C. ∙ Chi, K. ∙ Yang, M. ... Staphylococcal enterotoxin A induces intestinal barrier dysfunction and activates NLRP3 inflammasome via NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathways in mice Toxins (Basel). 2022; 14 Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar ). Doxorubicin causes apoptosis-related mucosal damage ( Dekaney et al., 2009 21. Dekaney, C.M. ∙ Gulati, A.S. ∙ Garrison, A.P. ... Regeneration of intestinal stem/progenitor cells following doxorubicin treatment of mice Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2009; 297 :G461-G470 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon injury, the intestinal epithelial cells may release an alarmin cytokine IL33 that binds to IL33 receptor on EC cells and induces 5-HT release via TRPA1 ( Chen et al., 2021 18. Chen, Z. ∙ Luo, J. ∙ Li, J. ... Interleukin-33 promotes serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells for intestinal homeostasis Immunity. 2021; 54 :151-163.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that SEA and doxorubicin may recruit the gut-to-brain circuit via this immune-neuroendocrine axis ( Figure S7 M). We found that SEA- and doxorubicin-induced defensive responses were significantly impaired by genetic deletion of Il33 (encoding IL33) ( Figures S7 N and S7O), Il1rl1 (encoding IL33 receptor ST2) ( Figures S7 P and S7Q), or Trpa1 ( Figures S7 R and S7S) in mice. These data support the hypothesis that SEA and doxorubicin may recruit the gut-to-brain circuit via an immune-neuroendocrine axis.

Section: Discussion

After ingesting toxins, the body generates a series of defensive responses ( Horn, 2008 32. Horn, C.C. Why is the neurobiology of nausea and vomiting so important? Appetite. 2008; 50 :430-434 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Singh et al., 2016 71. Singh, P. ∙ Yoon, S.S. ∙ Kuo, B. Nausea: a review of pathophysiology and therapeutics Ther. Adv.

(Editors) Nausea and vomiting: diagnosis and treatment Springer International Publishing, 2017; 15-25 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ). The mechanisms underlying the detection of toxins and coordination of defensive responses are poorly understood. The major obstacle hampering addressing these questions is the lack of mouse-based experimental paradigm. We have developed this paradigm and thereby revealed molecularly defined gut-to-brain circuit for transmitting toxin-relevant signals and divergent brain circuits for coordinating toxin-induced defensive responses in mice ( Figure 7 M).
Unlike emetic species, rodents do not vomit, probably due to anatomical differences. For example, the smooth muscle of esophagus in rodents may not be strong enough to facilitate expulsion of food from the gastrointestinal tract ( Horn et al., 2013 34. Horn, C.C. ∙ Kimball, B.A. ∙ Wang, H. ... Why can't rodents vomit? A comparative behavioral, anatomical, and physiological study PLoS One. 2013; 8 :e60537 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, they do display emetics-induced pica ( Takeda et al., 1993 74. Takeda, N. ∙ Hasegawa, S. ∙ Morita, M. ... Pica in rats is analogous to emesis: an animal model in emesis research Pharmacol.

The early studies on retching-like behavior in mice failed to perform physiological validation ( Tanaka, 1955 75. Tanaka, K. Studies on veratrum alkaloids. 20.

No further studies on retching were conducted in mice, because multiple emetic species were available for studying the neurobiology of emesis ( King, 1990 44. King, G.L. Animal models in the study of vomiting Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 68 :260-268 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we provide behavioral and physiological evidence showing that mice display retching-like behavior in response to SEA and other toxins.
The DVC is an important brain area consisting of many neurons defined by diverse molecular markers ( Ludwig et al., 2021 51. Ludwig, M.Q. ∙ Cheng, W. ∙ Gordian, D. ... A genetic map of the mouse dorsal vagal complex and its role in obesity Nat. Metab. 2021; 3 :530-545 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several neuronal subtypes in the DVC that express neuropeptides are implicated in the regulation of food ingestion ( Cck +: D’Agostino et al., 2016 19.

In this study, we explored neuronal subtypes in the DVC that are critical for toxin-induced defensive responses.
Substance P is an endogenous ligand for NK 1 R ( Krause et al., 1992 47. Krause, J.E. ∙ Takeda, Y. ∙ Hershey, A.D. Structure, functions, and mechanisms of substance P receptor action J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98 :2S-7S Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is sufficient to induce vomiting in emetic species ( Carpenter et al., 1984 14. Carpenter, D.O. ∙ Briggs, D.B. ∙ Strominger, N. Peptide-induced emesis in dogs Behav. Brain Res. 1984; 11 :277-281 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although abundant substance P neurons exist in the DVC of rodents ( Kanazawa and Jessell, 1976 41. Kanazawa, I. ∙ Jessell, T. Post mortem changes and regional distribution of substance P in the rat and mouse nervous system Brain Res. 1976; 117 :362-367 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ) and humans ( McRitchie and Törk, 1994 55. McRitchie, D.A. ∙ Törk, I. Distribution of substance P-like immunoreactive neurons and terminals throughout the nucleus of the solitary tract in the human brainstem J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 343 :83-101 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), their functions remain unclear. Our data revealed a critical role of Tac1 + DVC neurons, which express substance P and other tachykinin neuropeptides ( Cao et al., 1998 13. Cao, Y.Q. ∙ Mantyh, P.W. ∙ Carlson, E.J. ... Primary afferent tachykinins are required to experience moderate to intense pain Nature. 1998; 392 :390-394 Crossref Scopus (519) PubMed Google Scholar ), in toxin-induced defensive responses. In contrast, Cck+ and Npy+ DVC neurons that regulate food ingestion ( D’Agostino et al., 2016 19. D’Agostino, G. ∙ Lyons, D.J. ∙ Cristiano, C. ... Appetite controlled by a cholecystokinin nucleus of the solitary tract to hypothalamus neurocircuit eLife. 2016; 5 :e12225 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roman et al., 2016 68. Roman, C.W. ∙ Derkach, V.A. ∙ Palmiter, R.D. Genetically and functionally defined NTS to PBN brain circuits mediating anorexia Nat.

Biol. 2020; 30 :3986-3998.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ) were not essential for these responses. Thus, we discovered a key neuronal subtype in the DVC required for toxin-induced defensive responses.
In the DVC, the AP is another area involved in sensing toxins (e.g., LiCl and LPS) and providing neural signals to the LPB to induce CFA ( Zhang et al., 2021 87. Zhang, C.C. ∙ Kaye, J.A. ∙ Cai, Z.R. ... Area postrema cell types that mediate nausea-associated behaviors Neuron. 2021; 109 :461-472.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results do not rule out the possibility that the AP neurons may also participate in SEA-induced defensive responses.
Recent studies have identified multiple parallel gut-to-brain circuits to regulate food ingestion ( Williams et al., 2016 83. Williams, E.K. ∙ Chang, R.B. ∙ Strochlic, D.E. ...

Kim, D.Y. ∙ Heo, G. ∙ Kim, M. ... A neural circuit mechanism for mechanosensory feedback control of ingestion Nature. 2020; 580 :376-380 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies focused on sensory detection of nutrients or mechanical cues that regulate food ingestion. Our work explored the gut-to-brain circuit that are involved in detection of toxins in the gut. We identified a molecularly defined gut-to-brain circuit composed of a subset of Htr3a+ vagal sensory neurons that functionally link Tac1 + DVC neurons to 5-HT+ intestinal EC cells. Htr3a+ vagal sensory neurons are a large neuronal population in the NG that innervate different peripheral organs (gastrointestinal tract: Williams et al., 2016 83.

Potenzieri, C. ∙ Meeker, S. ∙ Undem, B.J. Activation of mouse bronchopulmonary C-fibres by serotonin and allergen-ovalbumin challenge J. Physiol. 2012; 590 :5449-5459 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; for review see Prescott and Liberles, 2022 65. Prescott, S.L. ∙ Liberles, S.D. Internal senses of the vagus nerve Neuron. 2022; 110 :579-599 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). We demonstrated that the subset of Htr3a+ vagal sensory neurons that monosynaptically innervate Tac1 + DVC neurons selectively responded to 5-HT rather than CCK8. These results are consistent with previous electrophysiological studies ( Peters et al., 1993 63. Peters, J.A. ∙ Malone, H.M. ∙ Lambert, J.J. An electrophysiological investigation of the properties of 5-HT3 receptors of rabbit nodose ganglion neurones in culture Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110 :665-676 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hillsley and Grundy, 1998 31. Hillsley, K. ∙ Grundy, D. Serotonin and cholecystokinin activate different populations of rat mesenteric vagal afferents Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 255 :63-66 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) and suggest that these vagal sensory neurons may not be involved in detecting CCK-mediated satiety signals in the gut. As gut chemosensors, EC cells use TRPA1 to detect irritants in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract ( Bellono et al., 2017 9. Bellono, N.W. ∙ Bayrer, J.R. ∙ Leitch, D.B. ... Enterochromaffin cells are gut chemosensors that couple to sensory neural pathways Cell. 2017; 170 :185-198.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (555) PubMed Google Scholar ) and chemotherapeutic drug metabolite acrolein ( Nozawa et al., 2009 60. Nozawa, K. ∙ Kawabata-Shoda, E. ∙ Doihara, H. ... TRPA1 regulates gastrointestinal motility through serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :3408-3413 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, EC cells release 5-HT in response to NSP4, an enterotoxin synthesized by rotavirus ( Hagbom et al., 2011 26. Hagbom, M. ∙ Istrate, C. ∙ Engblom, D. ... Rotavirus stimulates release of serotonin (5-HT) from human enterochromaffin cells and activates brain structures involved in nausea and vomiting PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7 :e1002115 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). We showed that ablation of 5-HT synthesis in intestinal EC cells impaired retching-like behavior and CFA, suggesting EC cells are gut chemosensors for toxin-induced defensive responses.
We propose that retching and CFA are controlled by Tac1+ DVC-rVRG and DVC-LPB pathways, respectively. The rVRG is part of ventral respiratory column that contain respiratory neurons ( Smith et al., 2009 73. Smith, J.C. ∙ Abdala, A.P. ∙ Rybak, I.A. ... Structural and functional architecture of respiratory networks in the mammalian brainstem Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364 :2577-2587 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). In these neurons, respiration-related activity is in synchrony with abdominal and phrenic nerve activity during vomiting ( Miller et al., 1987 57. Miller, A.D. ∙ Tan, L.K. ∙ Suzuki, I. Control of abdominal and expiratory intercostal muscle activity during vomiting: role of ventral respiratory group expiratory neurons J. Neurophysiol. 1987; 57 :1854-1866 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koga, 1991 46. Koga, T. Discharge patterns of bulbar respiratory neurons during retching and vomiting in decerebrate dogs Jpn. J. Physiol. 1991; 41 :233-249 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that Tac1 + DVC-rVRG pathway may recruit respiration-related neurons to trigger retching-like behavior in mice. The LPB relays multiple sensory signals to forebrain structures, including visceral malaise ( Palmiter, 2018 61. Palmiter, R.D. The parabrachial nucleus: CGRP neurons function as a general alarm Trends Neurosci. 2018; 41 :280-293 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). CGRP+ neurons are critical for conditioned taste aversion (CTA) learning ( Chen et al., 2018 17. Chen, J.Y. ∙ Campos, C.A. ∙ Jarvie, B.C. ... Parabrachial CGRP neurons establish and sustain aversive taste memories Neuron. 2018; 100 :891-899.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is likely that Tac1 + DVC-LPB pathway recruit CGRP+ LPB neurons to induce CFA.
Our study has several limitations. First, although our data suggest that an immune-neuroendocrine axis may be involved in toxin-induced defensive responses, it requires further investigations in future study. Cell-type-specific deletion of Il1rl1 and Trpa1 in EC cells are essential to draw a final conclusion. Second, the genetic identity of Htr3a+ vagal sensory neurons that innervate Tac1 + DVC neurons remain unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing is required to identify the molecular markers of these vagal sensory neurons ( Bai et al., 2019 6. Bai, L. ∙ Mesgarzadeh, S. ∙ Ramesh, K.S. ... Genetic identification of vagal sensory neurons that control feeding Cell. 2019; 179 :1129-1143.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kupari et al., 2019 48. Kupari, J. ∙ Häring, M. ∙ Agirre, E. ... An atlas of vagal sensory neurons and their molecular specialization Cell Rep. 2019; 27 :2508-2523.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, ablation of Tac1 or Slc17a6 in Tac1+ DVC neurons caused significant but mild effects on defensive responses. In future studies, we will test whether simultaneous ablations of these genes would have additive effects. Finally, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly reduced retching-like behavior but did not abolish it, suggesting that spinal afferents may also contribute to SEA-induced defensive responses in mice.

Tac1 f/f and Tph1 f/f , Il33 -/- , and Il1rl1 -/- mice were imported from GemPharmatech ( https://www.gempharmatech.com/ ). The Tac1-IRES-Flp mice were generated in this study (see below). Mice were maintained on a circadian 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum . Mice were housed in groups (3–5 animals per cage) before separation three days prior to virus injection. After virus injection, each mouse was housed in a single cage for at least 3 weeks before subsequent experiments. To avoid potential sex-specific differences, we used male mice only.
The Tac1-IRES-Flp mice were produced using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In brief, one single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting site (Sequence: TGAATAGATAGTGCGTTCAG) was used for Tac1 targeting. All homologous recombination donor templates were prepared based on mouse genomic sequence (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000072.7) by insertion of IRES-Flpe sequence to the end of Tac1 gene. The transcribed sgRNA and purified donor templates were mixed with Cas9 protein for mouse embryo microinjection. Genomic DNA from newborn pups was extracted from the tails of 7-day-old mice ( Ma et al., 2017 52. Ma, Y. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Huang, X. Building Cre Knockin Rat Lines Using CRISPR/Cas9. Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1642 :37-52 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genotyping was performed using primers listed in key resources table . Correct insertion was confirmed by sequencing.
Two adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes (AAV2/9, AAV2-retro) were used. The AAVs and RV used in the present study are listed in key resources table . Viral particles were purchased from Shanghai Taitool Bioscience Inc. and Brain VTA Inc. The viral vector titers before dilution were in the range of 0.8–1.5 × 10 13 viral particles/ml. The final titer used for AAV injection was 5 × 10 12 viral particles/ml.
Stereotaxic injection was performed according to our published work ( Huang et al., 2021 39. Huang, M. ∙ Li, D. ∙ Cheng, X. ... The tectonigral pathway regulates appetitive locomotion in predatory hunting in mice Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :4409 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of tribromoethanol (125–250 mg/kg). Standard surgery was performed to expose the brain surface above the DVC, LPB, and rVRG. Coordinates used for DVC injection were: bregma −7.56 mm, lateral ±0.50 mm, and dura −2.50 mm. Coordinates used for LPB injection were: bregma −5.34 mm, lateral ±1.30 mm, and dura −2.25 mm. Coordinates used for rVRG injection were: bregma −7.20 mm, lateral ±1.25 mm, and dura −4.00 mm. The AAVs were stereotaxically injected with a glass pipette connected to a Nanoliter Injector 201 (World Precision Instruments, Inc.) at a slow flow rate of 0.15 μl/min to avoid potential damage to local brain tissue. The pipette was withdrawn at least 20 min after viral injection.
For chemogenetic activation/inactivation, injections were bilateral. For anterograde and retrograde tracing, injections were bilateral. Behavioral tests were conducted 3 weeks after viral injection. Slice physiology and histology were conducted at least 3 weeks after AAV injection. Experimental designs related to viral injection are summarized in Table S2 .
At 30 min after AAV injection, a ceramic ferrule with an optical fiber (200 μm in diameter, N.A. 0.37) was implanted with the optical fiber tip on top of the DVC (bregma −7.56 mm, lateral ±0.50 mm, dura −2.50 mm). The ferrule was secured on the skull with dental cement. After optical fiber implantation, the skin was sutured, and antibiotics were applied to the surgical wound. Fiber photometry recording and optogenetic stimulation were conducted 3 weeks after fiber implantation. All experiments related to optical fiber implantation are summarized in Table S2 .
AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry or AAV-DIO-mCherry (control) was bilaterally injected into the DVC of Fos-2A-iCreER mice on Day 1. Then, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen was dissolved in corn oil (20 mg/ml) overnight on a shaker at 37 °C. On Day 7, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen was intraperitoneally injected into the Fos-2A-iCreER mice at a dose of 25 mg/kg. At 1 h after 4-OH-tamoxifen injection, the mice were intraperitoneally treated with SEA (SEA-TRAP) or saline (Saline-TRAP) in their home cages. On Day 28 (3 weeks after SEA-TRAP/Saline-TRAP), the mice were treated with SEA, followed by perfusion 3 h after treatment (SEA-Fos). Coronal sections were collected (bregma −6.24 to −8.24), evenly spaced by 200 μm, for immunohistochemical analysis of mCherry and Fos.
After AAV injection and optical fiber implantation, the mice were housed individually for 3 weeks before the behavioral tests and handled daily by the experimenters for at least three days. On the day of the behavioral test, the mice were transferred to the testing room and were habituated to the room conditions for 3 h before the experiments started. The apparatus was cleaned with 20% ethanol to eliminate odor cues from other mice. All behavioral tests were conducted during the same circadian period (13:00–19:00). All behaviors were scored by experimenters blind to the animal treatments.
Highly purified staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA, SEB, SEC1, SED, SEE, and SEH) were dissolved in saline and administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection or intragastric delivery by a gavage (0, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg). Protoveratrine A was dissolved in saline and administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection (0, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg). Copper sulfate was dissolved in saline and intragastrically administered to mice using a gavage needle (0, 60, and 120 mg/kg). Cisplatin was dissolved in saline and administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection (0, 5, and 10 mg/kg). Doxorubicin was dissolved in saline and administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection or intragastric delivery by a gavage (0, 5, and 10 mg/kg).
The mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline (control) or SEA dissolved in saline. The mice were then placed in an arena and their behaviors were recorded with a high-speed camera (160 frames/s) for 3 h. Time spent in retching-like behaviors was measured after the experiment off-line. The open angle of the mouth as a function of time was measured by a custom-written MATLAB program ( Figure S1 B). The MATLAB code is available upon request. Onset and offset of mouth-opening action were defined as the time when the open angle reached 10% peak angle and returned to 10% peak angle, respectively. Time spent in each mouth-opening action was defined as the time from the onset to the offset of each action. Total time spent in retching-like behavior in each mouse was calculated by adding the time spent in each mouth-opening action. The behavioral measurement procedures for cisplatin- and doxorubicin-induced retching-like behavior were the same as those for SEA described above. See Table S1 for more quantitative analyses of retching-like behavior.
CFA was performed according to a previous study ( Zhang et al., 2021 87. Zhang, C.C. ∙ Kaye, J.A. ∙ Cai, Z.R. ... Area postrema cell types that mediate nausea-associated behaviors Neuron. 2021; 109 :461-472.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the first three habituation days (Days 1 to 3), mice were subjected to water restriction for 23.5 h in their home cage and then transferred to the test cage equipped with two water bottles, in which they stayed for 30 min with ad libitum access of unflavored water from the water bottles. On Day 4, the water-restricted mice were transferred to the test cage with two bottles filled with grape- or cherry-flavored water sweetened with 0.2% saccharine. Immediately after water drinking in the test cage, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline (control) or SEA (0.30 mg/kg). In some experiments, LiCl was used to induce CFA (0.3 M, 6 ml/kg). On Day 5, the two water bottles were filled with unflavored water. On Day 6, the water bottles were filled with saccharine solution flavored with either cherry or grape. The consumption of flavored saccharine solution was measured using an automated lickometer ( Slotnick, 2009 72. Slotnick, B. A simple 2-transistor touch or lick detector circuit J. Exp. Anal. Behav. 2009; 91 :253-255 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar method was used for measuring cisplatin- and doxorubicin-induced CFA. CFA index was defined as the time spent drinking saccharine solution mixed with conditioned flavor divided by the total time spent drinking saccharine solution.
For physiological validation of toxin-induced retching-like behavior in mice, EMGs of both diaphragm and abdominal muscles were simultaneously recorded. The EMG recording method followed our previously published work ( Xie et al., 2022 84. Xie, Z.Y. ∙ Gu, H.T. ∙ Huang, M.Z. ... Mechanically evoked defensive attack is controlled by GABAergic neurons in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus Nat. Neurosci. 2022; 25 :72-85 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1.25 g/kg body weight). Satisfactory anesthesia was verified by the lack of hindlimb retraction to a toe pinch. Supplementary doses of 100 mg/kg were administered as needed. Each mouse was placed in a stereotaxic frame in a prone position. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a program-controlled heating pad. To monitor diaphragm muscle activity, we implanted acute EMG electrodes in the right dome of the diaphragm muscle. To monitor abdominal muscle activity, we implanted acute EMG electrodes in the external oblique muscle in the lateral abdominal region. The EMG electrode was made of flexible multi-strand stainless steel wires (A-M Systems, No. 793200). The insulation of a small segment of the wire (∼0.5 mm) was removed to expose the electrode to the muscle. During the surgical procedure, the wires were threaded through and anchored with a knot in the muscle. The wires were then attached to ground electrodes on the forelimb. After surgery, mice were connected to flexible EMG connection cables and EMG signals were recorded using a Microelectrode AC Amplifier Model 1800 (A-M System), filtered (10–500 Hz EMG recordings) and digitized at 250 Hz using Spike2 software. A flashing LED triggered by a 1-s square-wave pulse was simultaneously recorded to synchronize the video and EMG signals. A muscle was considered activated when the amplitude of the EMG trace increased by at least 30% above the basal level.
To test the effects of CP-99994 on SEA-induced retching, mice were intraperitoneally treated with CP-99994 (10 mg/kg) or saline (control) 20 min before intraperitoneal treatment with SEA. To test the effects of granisetron on SEA-induced retching, mice were intraperitoneally treated with granisetron (5 mg/kg) or saline (control) 20 min before intraperitoneal treatment with SEA. After SEA treatment, the mice were placed in an arena and their behaviors were recorded with a high-speed camera. Time spent in retching-like behaviors was measured after the experiment off-line.
To test the effects of CP-99994 on SEA-induced CFA, mice that drank grape- or cherry-flavored saccharine solution on Day 4 were intraperitoneally treated with CP-99994 (10 mg/kg) or saline (control) 20 min before intraperitoneal treatment with SEA. To test the effects of granisetron on SEA-induced CFA, mice that drank grape- or cherry-flavored saccharine solution on Day 4 were intraperitoneally treated with granisetron (5 mg/kg) or saline (as a control) 20 min before intraperitoneal treatment with SEA. All other procedures were the same as those described in “ behavioral measurement of toxin-induced CFA ”.
Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy was performed according to our published work ( Chen et al., 2020 16. Chen, J. ∙ Cheng, M.X. ∙ Wang, L. ... A vagal-NTS neural pathway that stimulates feeding Curr. Biol. 2020; 30 :3986-3998.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, mice were anaesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane and underwent surgical procedures in ventral recumbency on a heating pad. The abdominal cavity was exposed by surgery, followed by the stomach and esophagus without damaging blood vessels or the liver. All identifiable vagus nerve fibers above the hepatic branches of the vagus were excised with micro-scissors to achieve total subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. The abdominal muscle layer and skin were then sutured. After vagotomy, the mice were allowed 2 weeks for recovery before subsequent experiments. To confirm the effectiveness of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, fluorogold dissolved in saline (2 mg/ml; 400 μl) was intraperitoneally injected into the vagotomized mice or control mice (sham surgery). The presence of fluorogold in the dorsal vagal complex was histologically examined in the mice.
For chemogenetic manipulation of DVC neurons, AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry (for inactivation) or AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry (for activation) was bilaterally injected into the DVC of individual Cre mouse lines. Chemogenetic manipulation was performed about 3 weeks after viral injection. Clozapine N-oxide (CNO) stock solution was prepared in saline at 5 mg/ml. To prepare working solution for experiments, CNO was diluted 1:10 with saline (0.5 mg/ml). Mice were intraperitoneally injected with either saline (control) or CNO (1 mg/kg). Mice injected with CNO were allowed to rest for 15 min before behavioral tests.
Mice with Tac1 + DVC neurons expressing hM4Di-mCherry or mCherry (control) were intraperitoneally treated with CNO (1 mg/kg) 20 min before intraperitoneal treatment with SEA. The mice were then placed in an arena and their behaviors were recorded with a high-speed camera. Time spent in retching-like behaviors was measured after the experiment off-line. Similar methods were used for SEA-TRAP mice with SEA-activated DVC neurons expressing hM4Di-mCherry or mCherry (control).
After drinking grape- or cherry-flavored saccharine solution on Day 4, mice with Tac1 + DVC neurons expressing hM4Di-mCherry or mCherry (control) were intraperitoneally treated with CNO (1 mg/kg) 20 min before intraperitoneal treatment with SEA. All other procedures were the same as those described in “ behavioral measurement of toxin-induced CFA ”.
Mice with Tac1 + DVC neurons expressing hM3Dq-mCherry or mCherry (control) were intraperitoneally treated with CNO (1 mg/kg). The mice were then placed in an arena and their behaviors were recorded with a high-speed camera. Time spent in retching-like behaviors was measured after the experiment off-line.
After drinking grape- or cherry-flavored saccharine solution on Day 4, mice with Tac1 + DVC neurons expressing hM3Dq-mCherry or mCherry (control) were intraperitoneally treated with CNO (1 mg/kg) rather than SEA. Two days after conditioning, the mice were subjected to a two-bottle choice test comparing consumption of cherry- and grape-flavored saccharine solutions. All other procedures were the same as those described in “ behavioral measurement of SEA-induced CFA ”.
For optogenetic stimulation, the output of the laser was measured and adjusted to 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 mW before each experiment. The pulse onset, duration, and frequency of light stimulation were controlled by a programmable pulse generator attached to the laser system. Optogenetic stimulation was usually performed 3 weeks after AAV injection. On the day of experiment, the test mouse with optic fiber implantation above the NTS was allowed to explore an arena (20 cm x 20 cm) for 15 minutes. Then light stimulation was applied to optogenetically activate Tac1 + DVC neurons. Laser power and frequency of light pulses were adjusted to measure the dependence of retching on different parameters of light stimulation. The behavior of test mouse was recorded with a high-speed camera (100 frames/sec). Three light stimulation protocols [(20 Hz, 2 mW), (20 Hz, 10 mW), (10 Hz, 10 mW)] were used to test the dependence of retching time on laser power and light stimulation frequency.
To induce gaping response in mice, quinine solution (5 mM, 100 μl/s) was intraorally delivered with a peristaltic pump. The gaping response was recorded with a high-speed camera. The peak angle of the open mouth during gaping response was measured by the same custom-written MATLAB program for retching-like behavior.
The SEA-treated male mice were placed in a test arena in a sound-proof box (Pan Lab, USA) which was equipped with an ultrasonic microphone (CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany) for recording ultrasonic vocalization (USV). USVs were recorded in the arena via UltraSoundGate 116H interface (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany) and then digitally stored at 250 kHz in SASLab Lite software (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany). Prior to test, synchronization between sounds and other signals was calibrated by synchronously sending out artificial signals (current, lights, sounds). After experiments, ultrasonic vocalizations were then analyzed offline in spike2 software (CED co., UK). Build-in ‘sonogram’ function was applied to perform a fast Fourier transformation (hanning window, 256 block size) on raw waveforms to generate high-resolution spectrograms. As a positive control, the SEA-treated male mice were introduced with a female conspecific to elicit USVs.
Monitoring ventilation followed our previous study ( Liu et al., 2017 50. Liu, Z. ∙ Chen, Z. ∙ Shang, C. ... IGF1-dependent synaptic plasticity of mitral cells in olfactory memory during social learning Neuron. 2017; 95 :106-122.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). One week before ventilation recording, mice were implanted with an intranasal cannula during anesthesia. On the day of recording, the intranasal cannula was connected to a pressure transducer by a piece of polyethylene tubing. During the experiment, breathing of freely moving mice was monitored by measuring intranasal respiratory pressure. The voltage was amplified 100×, low-pass filtered at 100 Hz, and digitized at 8 000 Hz using Spike2.
A fiber photometry system (Thinker Tech, Nanjing, China) was used for recording GCaMP signals from Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Gunaydin et al., 2014 25. Gunaydin, L.A. ∙ Grosenick, L. ∙ Finkelstein, J.C. ... Natural neural projection dynamics underlying social behavior Cell. 2014; 157 :1535-1551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ). To induce fluorescence signals, a laser beam from a laser tube (488 nm) was reflected by a dichroic mirror, focused by a 10× lens (N.A. 0.3), and coupled to an optical commutator. A 2-m optical fiber (230-μm diameter, N.A. 0.37) guided the light between the commutator and implanted optical fiber. To minimize photo bleaching, the power intensity at the fiber tip was adjusted to 0.02 mW. GCaMP7s ( Dana et al., 2019 20. Dana, H. ∙ Sun, Y. ∙ Mohar, B. ... High-performance calcium sensors for imaging activity in neuronal populations and microcompartments Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :649-657 Crossref Scopus (625) PubMed Google Scholar ) fluorescence was band-pass filtered (MF525-39, Thorlabs) and collected using a photomultiplier tube (R3896, Hamamatsu). An amplifier (C7319, Hamamatsu) was used to convert the photomultiplier tube current output to voltage signals, which were further filtered through a low-pass filter (40 Hz cut-off; Brownlee 440). The analogue voltage signals were digitalized at 100 Hz and recorded by a Power 1401 digitizer and Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge, UK).
AAV-hSyn-DIO-GCaMP7s was stereotaxically injected into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice, followed by optical fiber implantation above the Tac1 + DVC neurons (see “ stereotaxic injection ” and “ optical fiber implantation ”). Three weeks after AAV injection, fiber photometry was used to record GCaMP signals from Tac1 + DVC neurons in freely moving mice monitored by a high-speed camera. A flashing LED triggered by a 1-s square-wave pulse was simultaneously recorded to synchronize the video and GCaMP signals. Fiber photometry started before intragastric or intraperitoneal application of SEA. The recording continued in real-time in parallel with SEA administration and SEA-induced retching-like behavior in mice. The GCaMP fluorescence was routinely normalized by calculating ΔF/F, according to established method ( Gunaydin et al., 2014 25. Gunaydin, L.A. ∙ Grosenick, L. ∙ Finkelstein, J.C. ... Natural neural projection dynamics underlying social behavior Cell. 2014; 157 :1535-1551 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ). EGFP was used as a control for GCaMP7. After the experiments, the optical fiber tip sites above the NTS were histologically examined in each mouse.
A modified RV-based three-virus system was used for mapping whole-brain inputs to Tac1 + DVC neurons ( Wickersham et al., 2007 82. Wickersham, I.R. ∙ Finke, S. ∙ Conzelmann, K.K. ... Retrograde neuronal tracing with a deletion-mutant rabies virus Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :47-49 Crossref Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar ). All viruses, including AAV2/9-CAG-DIO-tdTomato-2A-TVA (5 × 10 12 viral particles per ml), AAV2/9-CAG-DIO-RVG (5 × 10 12 viral particles/ml), and EnvA-pseudotyped, glycoprotein (RG)-deleted, and EGFP-expressing RVs (RV-EvnA-ΔG-EGFP) (5.0 × 10 8 viral particles/ml), were packaged and provided by BrainVTA Inc. (Wuhan, China). A mixture of AAV2/9-CAG-DIO-tdTomato-2A-TVA and AAV2/9-CAG-DIO-RVG (1:1, 200 nl) was stereotaxically injected into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice bilaterally. Two weeks after AAV helper injection, RV-EvnA-ΔG-EGFP (300 nl) was injected into the same location in the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice in a biosafety level-2 lab facility. Starter neurons were characterized by the co-expression of tdTomato and EGFP, which were restricted in the DVC. One week after injection of RV, the mice were perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The brain and nodose ganglion (NG) were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 8 h and then incubated in PBS containing 30% sucrose until they sank to the bottom. Coronal brain and NG sections (40-μm thickness) were prepared using a cryostat (Leica CM1900). All sections were collected and stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The sections were imaged with an Olympus VS120 epifluorescence microscope (10× objective lens) and analyzed with ImageJ software. For quantification of subregions, boundaries were based on the Allen Institute’s reference atlas. We selectively analyzed retrogradely labeled dense areas. The fractional distribution of total cells labeled with RV was measured.
For cell-type-specific anterograde tracing of Tac1 + DVC neurons, AAV-DIO-EGFP (200 nl) was stereotaxically injected into the DVC of Tac1-IRES-Cre mice. The mice were then maintained in a cage individually. Three weeks after viral injection, the mice were perfused with saline, followed by 4% PFA in PBS. The brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 8 h and then incubated in PBS containing 30% sucrose until they sank to the bottom. Coronal brain sections (40-μm thickness) were prepared using a cryostat (Leica CM1900). All coronal sections were collected and stained with primary antibodies against EGFP and DAPI. The coronal brain sections were imaged with an Olympus VS120 epifluorescence microscope (10× objective lens).
Preparation of acute brain slices was performed according to previous study ( Liu et al., 2017 50. Liu, Z. ∙ Chen, Z. ∙ Shang, C. ... IGF1-dependent synaptic plasticity of mitral cells in olfactory memory during social learning Neuron. 2017; 95 :106-122.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Brain slices containing the DVC were prepared from adult mice anesthetized with isofiurane before decapitation. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ) cutting solution (228 mM sucrose, 11 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM NaH 2 P O 4 , 2.5 mM KCl, 7 mM MgSO 4 , and 0.5 mM CaCl 2 ). Coronal brain slices (400-μm thickness) were cut using a vibratome (VT 1200S, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The slices were incubated at 28 °C in oxygenated ACSF (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.0 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM NaHCO 3 , 15 mM glucose, and 2.0 mM CaCl 2 ) for 30 min (∼305 mOsm, pH 7.4). The slices were then kept at room temperature under the same conditions for 30 min before transfer to the recording chamber at room temperature. The ACSF was perfused at 1 ml/min. The acute brain slices were visualized with a 40× Olympus water immersion lens, differential interference contrast optics (Olympus Inc., Japan), and a CCD camera.
Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubes (Cat #64-0793, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) using a PC-10 pipette puller (Narishige Inc., Tokyo, Japan). For recording of APs (current clamp), pipettes were filled with solution (135 mM K-methanesulfonate, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na-GTP, 4 mM Mg-ATP, pH 7.4). For recording of postsynaptic currents (voltage clamp), pipettes were filled with solution (135 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM QX-314 chloride, 1 mM Na-GTP, 4 mM Mg-ATP, pH 7.4). The resistance of pipettes varied between 3.0–3.5 MΩ. The current and voltage signals were recorded with MultiClamp 700B and Clampex 10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices). After establishment of the whole-cell configuration and equilibration of the intracellular pipette solution with the cytoplasm, series resistance was compensated to 10–15 MΩ. Recordings with series resistances > 15 MΩ were rejected. An optical fiber (200-μm diameter) was used to deliver light pulses, with the fiber tip positioned 500 μm above the brain slices. Laser power was adjusted to 2 mW before each experiment. Pulse onset, duration, and frequency of light stimulation were controlled by a programmable pulse generator attached to the laser system. Light-evoked postsynaptic currents from ChR2-mCherry-negative neurons in the DVC were triggered by a single light-pulse (2 ms) or a light-pulse train (473 nm, 2 ms, 10 Hz, 2 mW) in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 20 μM) and tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM). D-AP5 (50 μM), CNQX (20 μM), picrotoxin (PTX, 50 μM), and GR82334 (1 μM) were perfused with ACSF to examine the neurotransmitter receptor type of optically evoked postsynaptic currents.
Both left and right nodose/jugular ganglia containing RV-labeled vagal sensory neurons were harvested. Ganglia were digested in Hank’s solution containing collagenase I (2 mg/ml) and dispase II (3 mg/ml) at 37 °C in an incubator for 30 min, washed with Gibco L-15 medium three times, and gently dissociated with a 1-ml pipette. Isolated single cells were filtered with a 50-mm cell strainer, resuspended in culture medium (Gibco L-15 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)), placed onto a Matrigel-coated coverslip, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in an incubator until most cells were attached to the coverslip. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed to record postsynaptic currents from EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons infected with RV ( Cao et al., 2013 12. Cao, P. ∙ Yang, X. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Complexin activates exocytosis of distinct secretory vesicles controlled by different synaptotagmins J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 :1714-1727 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). The bath solution contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). The whole-cell intracellular pipette solution contained (in mM) 135 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 1 Na-GTP, 4 Mg-ATP, and 10 QX-314 (pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubes (Warner Instruments, Cat #64-0793) using a PC-10 pipette puller (Narishiage Inc.). The resistance of pipettes filled with intracellular pipette solution varied between 3.0–3.5 MΩ. EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons were visualized with a 40× water immersion lens, differential interference contrast optics, and a CCD camera (Q-Imaging Rolera-XR, BC, Canada). The neurons were then randomly picked for patching and maintained in voltage-clamp (−70 mV) whole-cell configuration using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices Inc.). After establishment of whole-cell configuration and equilibration of the intracellular pipette solution with the cytoplasm, series resistance was compensated to 10–15 MΩ. Recordings with series resistances > 15 MΩ were rejected. A pipette containing extracellular solution with a certain reagent (5-HT, 10 μM; CCK-8, 10 nM; Ondansetron, 10 μM) was positioned 200 μm above the recorded EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons. Using Picospritzer III, a puff of individual reagent was delivered at 5 psi for 1 s while EGFP+ vagal sensory neurons were recorded.
EC cells were dissociated according to an established method ( Knutson et al., 2018 45. Knutson, K. ∙ Strege, P.R. ∙ Li, J. ... Whole cell electrophysiology of primary cultured murine enterochromaffin cells J. Vis. Exp. 2018; 139 :58112 Google Scholar ). In brief, Tph1-CFP transgenic mice were anaesthetized, followed by collection of the small intestine. After washing luminal contents out, intestinal tissue was inverted and chopped into small pieces. The tissue was digested with Collagenase type XI (0.6 mg/mL) at 37 °C in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for a total of 30 min. Supernatants from the last digestion were collected by centrifugation (100 g, 5 min). Cell pellet was resuspended at in DMEM containing 5% FBS, 1% Pen-step, 1% L-Glutamine, and 10 μM Y-27632. Cells were plated on coverslips coated with Matrigel. Cells were maintained in standard culture conditions for 24-48 hours before whole-cell recording. The procedure for whole-cell recording was the similar to the procedure for recording dissociated NG neurons.
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and sequentially perfused with saline and PBS with 4% PFA. Brains were incubated in PBS containing 30% sucrose until they sank to the bottom. Cryostat sections (40 μm) were collected, incubated overnight with blocking solution (PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.7% Triton X-100), then treated with primary antibodies diluted with blocking solution for 3–4 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemical analysis are displayed in key resources table . Primary antibodies were washed three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.7% Triton X-100) before incubation with secondary antibodies (tagged with Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5; dilution 1:500; Life Technologies Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then washed three times with washing buffer, stained with DAPI, washed with PBS, transferred onto Super Frost slides, and mounted under glass coverslips with mounting media. Sections were imaged with an Olympus VS120 epifluorescence microscope (10× objective lens) or a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (20× and 60× oil-immersion objective lens). Samples were excited by 488-, 543-, or 633-nm lasers in sequential acquisition mode to avoid signal leakage. Saturation was avoided by monitoring pixel intensity under Hi-Lo mode. Confocal images were analyzed with ImageJ software.
Mice were perfused with 0.1% DEPC- (Sigma, D5758) treated PBS, followed by DEPC-treated PBS containing 4% PFA (PBS-PFA). Brains were post-fixed in DEPC-treated PBS-PFA solution overnight and then placed in DEPC-treated 30% sucrose solution at 4 °C for 30 h. Brain sections (30-μm thickness) were prepared using a cryostat (Leica, CM3050S) and collected in DEPC-treated PBS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed as described previously ( Chen et al., 2020 16. Chen, J. ∙ Cheng, M.X. ∙ Wang, L. ... A vagal-NTS neural pathway that stimulates feeding Curr. Biol. 2020; 30 :3986-3998.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), with minor modifications. Briefly, brain sections were rinsed with DEPC-treated PBS, permeabilized with DEPC-treated 0.1% Tween 20 solution (in PBS) and DEPC-treated 2 × SSC containing 0.5% Triton. Brain sections were then treated with H 2 O 2 solution and acetic anhydride solution to reduce nonspecific FISH signals. After 2 h of incubation in prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% Tween20, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mM EDTA in DEPC-treated water) at 65 °C, the brain sections were hybridized with hybridization solution containing mouse anti-sense cRNA probes (digoxigenin labeling) for Tac1 , Cck , and Npy at 65 °C for 20 h. The cDNA primer sequences for the cRNA probes were the same as those in the ISH data from the Allen Brain Atlas ( https://mouse.brain-map.org/ ), as listed in key resources table . After washing, the brain sections were incubated with anti-digoxigenin-POD, Fab fragments (1:400, Roche, 11207733910) at 4 °C for 30 h, and FISH signals were detected using a TSA Plus Cyanine 3 Kit (NEL744001KT, PerkinElmer). To visualize tdTomato and mCherry signals, the brain sections were incubated with primary antibodies against mCherry at 4 °C for 24 h and then with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:500, A11034, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 2 h. The brain sections were mounted and imaged using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope or the Olympus VS120 Slide Scanning System.
The cell-counting strategies are summarized in Table S3 . For counting cells in the DVC, we collected 40-μm coronal sections from bregma −6.24 to −8.24 for each mouse. Five evenly spaced (200 μm) sections were sampled for immunohistochemistry or FISH to label cells positive for different markers. We acquired fluorescent images (10× objective, Olympus FV1200 microscope) of the DVC, followed by cell counting with ImageJ software.
Quantitative analysis of IGLEs followed standard criteria ( Wang and Powley, 2000 79. Wang, F.B. ∙ Powley, T.L. Topographic inventories of vagal afferents in gastrointestinal muscle J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 421 :302-324 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The stomach was divided into the gastric fundus, corpus, and antrum. The small intestine was divided into four segments (0–3 cm, 3–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm). The large intestine was divided into two segments (colon and rectum). In the whole-mount sections, enteric neurons were labeled by immunostaining of NeuN. Representative images of each segment covering ∼20 mm 2 were taken from the gastrointestinal tissues. The density of IGLEs in the representative images was calculated by the total number of IGLEs divided by the analyzed area in the whole-mount section. For Quantitative analyses of mucosal endings in gastrointestinal tract, the stomach was divided into three segments: greater curvature of gastric corpus, lesser curvature of gastric corpus, and gastric antrum. The small intestine was divided into four segments (0–3 cm, 3–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm). In the whole-mount preparation, the EGFP+ endings and 5-HT+ EC cells in villi and crypts were visualized by immunostaining of EGFP and 5-HT. Representative images covering ∼20 mm 2 were taken from each segment of the gastrointestinal tissues. The ratio of mucosal innervation of the EGFP+ axonal terminals in the villi and crypts in the analyzed area of the whole-mount section in the representative images was calculated.
All experiments were performed with anonymized samples in which the experimenter was unaware of the experimental conditions of the mice. For statistical analyses of experimental data, Student t -test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. The “n” used in these analyses represents number of mice or cells. Detailed information on statistical analyses is provided in the figure legends and Table S4 .
