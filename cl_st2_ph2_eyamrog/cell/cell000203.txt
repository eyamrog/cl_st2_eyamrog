Title: Structural Basis for Blocking Sugar Uptake into the Malaria Parasite Plasmodium falciparum


Abstract: Summary

Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria, rely on glucose for energy supply during blood stage. Inhibition of glucose uptake thus represents a potential strategy for the development of antimalarial drugs. Here, we present the crystal structures of PfHT1, the sole hexose transporter in the genome of Plasmodium species, at resolutions of 2.6 Å in complex with D-glucose and 3.7 Å with a moderately selective inhibitor, C3361. Although both structures exhibit occluded conformations, binding of C3361 induces marked rearrangements that result in an additional pocket. This inhibitor-binding-induced pocket presents an opportunity for the rational design of PfHT1-specific inhibitors. Among our designed C3361 derivatives, several exhibited improved inhibition of PfHT1 and cellular potency against P. falciparum , with excellent selectivity to human GLUT1. These findings serve as a proof of concept for the development of the next-generation antimalarial chemotherapeutics by simultaneously targeting the orthosteric and allosteric sites of PfHT1.

Section: Introduction

Despite decades of efforts to eradicate the disease, malaria remains a widespread endemic in the tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Malaria is caused by the parasites Plasmodium spp ., which are transmitted through mosquito bites; the deadliest form is P. falciparum ( Ashley et al., 2018 4. Ashley, E.A. ∙ Pyae Phyo, A. ∙ Woodrow, C.J. Malaria Lancet. 2018; 391 :1608-1621 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ; Milner, 2018 44. Milner, Jr., D.A. Malaria Pathogenesis Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2018; 8 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although distinct classes of drugs, exemplified by chloroquine, artemisinin, and their derivatives, have been developed for the treatment of malaria with great success in the past, multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium strains have evolved, necessitating the next-generation antimalarial therapeutics with unconventional mechanism to eradicate the deadly disease ( Fairhurst and Dondorp, 2016 15.

The malaria parasites utilize glucose as the primary carbon source ( Kirk et al., 1996 30. Kirk, K. ∙ Horner, H.A. ∙ Kirk, J. Glucose uptake in Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes is an equilibrative not an active process Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82 :195-205 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). One potential strategy for antimalarial drug discovery is to selectively inhibit parasitic glucose uptake without compromising the same physiological process in the host. Glucose uptake into P. falciparum is mediated by the hexose transporter PfHT1 ( Woodrow et al., 1999 64. Woodrow, C.J. ∙ Penny, J.I. ∙ Krishna, S.

Inhibition of PfHT1 by a small-molecule glucose derivative, compound 3361 (C3361), effectively suppresses the growth of P. falciparum cultured in medium with D-glucose or D-fructose ( Blume et al., 2011 8.

PfHT1 (TCDB #: 2.A.1.1.24) belongs to the sugar porter (SP) family within the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) ( Yan, 2017 69. Yan, N. A glimpse of membrane transport through structures-advances in the structural biology of the GLUT glucose transporters J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 :2710-2725 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). It shares 29% and 48% sequence identity and similarity, respectively, with human GLUT1 (TCDB #: 2.A.1.1.28), the primary glucose transporter in erythrocytes ( Figure S1 ). This relatively low sequence conservation may translate into meaningful structural differences that would allow selective inhibition of PfHT1 over human glucose transporters. For instance, C3361 inhibits PfHT1 and GLUT1 with an over 60-fold selectivity difference in K i values, namely ∼50 μΜ versus ∼3.3 mM ( Joët et al., 2003 26. Joët, T. ∙ Eckstein-Ludwig, U. ∙ Morin, C. ... Validation of the hexose transporter of Plasmodium falciparum as a novel drug target Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nonetheless, the low sequence similarity between PfHT1 and other sugar transporters also prevents reliable homology modeling, necessitating high resolution structures for consequential inhibitor optimizations.
As the most extensive and ubiquitous transporter family, a number of MFS sugar transporters have been structurally elucidated, including the E. coli lactose: H + symporter LacY, the xylose: H + symporter XylE, the human glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, and mammalian fructose transporter GLUT5 ( Abramson et al., 2003 2.

MFS members all share the core structure of twelve transmembrane segments (TMs) that fold into symmetry-related amino (N) and carboxy (C) domains, within each of which the six TMs are further arranged as “3+3” inverted repeats ( Radestock and Forrest, 2011 48.

We successfully obtained the crystal structure of PfHT1 in the presence of D-glucose at 2.6-Å resolution years ago, and since then have been focusing on the complex structure with C3361, which was eventually determined at 3.7-Å resolution using lipidic cubic phase (LCP) crystallization. Based on these structures, we designed and optimized compounds that exhibit markedly improved potency while retaining selectivity. During our manuscript preparation, the structure of PfHT1 bound to D-glucose at 3.6-Å resolution was reported ( Qureshi et al., 2020 47. Qureshi, A.A. ∙ Suades, A. ∙ Matsuoka, R. ... The molecular basis for sugar import in malaria parasites Nature. 2020; 578 :321-325 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although our high-resolution structure is able to reveal, in more intricate detail, the ligand coordination and inter-domain interaction, we will focus this paper on the inhibitor-bound PfHT1 complex and the structure-facilitated inhibitor design.

Section: Results

For crystallization of PfHT1, the N-terminal His 10 -tagged full-length protein was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. The glucose transport activity of purified recombinant protein was confirmed in a liposome-based counterflow assay ( Figure 1 A). Crystals of PfHT1, in the presence of 0.4% (w/v) n -nonyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (β-NG, Anatrace) and 50 mM glucose, were obtained and diffracted X-rays beyond 2.6 Å. The structure was determined using molecular replacement (MR) with the coordinates of glucose-bound GLUT3 ( Deng et al., 2015 13. Deng, D. ∙ Sun, P. ∙ Yan, C. ... Molecular basis of ligand recognition and transport by glucose transporters Nature. 2015; 526 :391-396 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a search model. The final atomic model was refined to a 2.6-Å resolution with excellent electron density ( Figures 1 B, S2 A, and S2B; Table S1 ). There are four protein molecules within each unit cell of the PfHT1-glucose crystal in the P2 1 space group ( Figure S2 C). The four molecules are primarily identical, with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values of 0.2–0.3 Å when the overall structures are superimposed pairwise ( Figure S2 D).
Like all other SP members, the N and C domains of PfHT1 are related by a 2-fold pseudo-symmetry around an axis that is perpendicular to the membrane plane. PfHT1 shares the following common features with GLUTs and other SP members ( Yan, 2017 69. Yan, N. A glimpse of membrane transport through structures-advances in the structural biology of the GLUT glucose transporters J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 :2710-2725 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). (1) The intervening sequence between the N and C domains, as well as the C-terminal segment, constitute an intracellular helical (ICH) domain that consists of short helices. (2) The extracellular half of TM1, albeit shorter in PfHT1 than in GLUTs, is bent to form an extracellular helix designated TM1e, which is almost parallel to the membrane plane. (3) TM7 is broken in the middle and the resulting segments are named TM7a and TM7b ( Figure 1 B).
A glucose molecule can be unambiguously assigned in the central pocket enclosed by the N and C domains. The overall transmembrane domain of PfHT1 has similar dimensions on the extracellular and intracellular sides, with the bound glucose sealed from both sides of the membrane ( Figures 1 B and S2 B). Therefore, the structure represents a substrate-bound occluded state, similar to the recently reported structure of PfHT1 ( Qureshi et al., 2020 47. Qureshi, A.A. ∙ Suades, A. ∙ Matsuoka, R. ... The molecular basis for sugar import in malaria parasites Nature. 2020; 578 :321-325 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Despite the relatively low overall sequence similarity and different conformations, the residues that constitute the glucose binding site are nearly identical to those in the inward-open GLUT1 and outward-facing GLUT3 ( Figure 1 C) ( Deng et al., 2014 12. Deng, D. ∙ Xu, C. ∙ Sun, P. ... Crystal structure of the human glucose transporter GLUT1 Nature. 2014; 510 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 13. Deng, D. ∙ Sun, P. ∙ Yan, C. ... Molecular basis of ligand recognition and transport by glucose transporters Nature. 2015; 526 :391-396 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each and every hydroxyl group on glucose is coordinated through at least one hydrogen bond (H-bond). The N domain only contributes Gln169 on TM5, whereas the C domain engages four polar residues: Gln305 on TM7a, Asn311 on TM7b, Asn341 on TM8, and Trp412 on TM10. Since the published structure mainly focuses on substrate recognition and promiscuity ( Qureshi et al., 2020 47. Qureshi, A.A. ∙ Suades, A. ∙ Matsuoka, R. ... The molecular basis for sugar import in malaria parasites Nature. 2020; 578 :321-325 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), we will not elaborate here.
When compared to the outward-open and outward-occluded structures of human GLUT3 ( Deng et al., 2015 13. Deng, D. ∙ Sun, P. ∙ Yan, C. ... Molecular basis of ligand recognition and transport by glucose transporters Nature. 2015; 526 :391-396 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ), the domain-wise shift is minor between the overall structures. However, major local shift is found in TM7b. In PfHT1, the half transmembrane helix is bent to a larger degree to further seal the bound sugar in the accommodation site. Together, a consecutive bending of TM7b has been observed between the outward-open GLUT3, outward-occluded GLUT3, and the occluded PfHT1, highlighting the critical role of the flexible TM7b during the alternating access cycle ( Figure 1 D).
The extracellular loops, L1-2 (residues 59–70) between TM1 and TM2 and L5-6 (residues 186–200) between TM5 and TM6, are substantially longer than the corresponding segments in XylE and GLUTs. Also, a disulfide bond between Cys61 and Cys70 is revealed ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Disruption of the disulfide bond by substitution of Cys61 with Ser led to a nearly 60% reduction in transport activity ( Figure 1 E). Cys61 and Cys70 demarcate TM1e and TM2, respectively. Disulfide formation may facilitate concerted motion between these two helices during alternating access.
Furthermore, deletion of either or both extracellular loops in the N domain led to enhanced glucose transport activity ( Figure 1 E). Deletion of the loops may constrain the relative motion of the connecting TMs, consistent with the importance of the disulfide bond. More dramatically, an Ala substitution of Arg67, a loop L1-2 residue that interacts with loop L5-6, resulted in a 2-fold increase in transport activity. These results suggest that these extracellular loops have a negligible role in glucose transport, although their biological functions, such as possible involvement in protein trafficking, await further investigation.
After structural determination of glucose-bound PfHT1, we set out to examine the inhibitory mechanism of PfHT1 by C3361. Using our counterflow assay, we confirmed the selective inhibition of PfHT1 by C3361. The IC 50 values of C3361 are 33.1 ± 2.0 μM for PfHT1, and approximately 1.3 mM and 0.7 mM for GLUT1 and GLUT3, respectively ( Figure 2 A). Extensive crystallization trials were then carried out for PfHT1 in the presence of C3361 using both vapor diffusion hanging drop and the LCP methods.
Crystallization of the PfHT1-C3361 complex was unexpectedly challenging, although C3361 only has an additional hydrophobic tail conjugated to the C3-OH of D-glucose. Eventually, LCP crystals of PfHT1 in the presence of 50 mM C3361 were obtained that could diffract X-rays beyond 4.0 Å. The structure was also determined using MR, with glucose-bound PfHT1 as the input, and the final model was refined to 3.7 Å ( Figures 2 B, S3 A, and S3B; Table S1 ). There are two nearly identical PfHT1 molecules in each asymmetric unit of the P4 1 22 space group ( Figures S3 C and S3D).
Interestingly, the aliphatic tail of C3361 induces sophisticated structural rearrangements of PfHT1 from the glucose-bound form ( Figure 2 C; Video S1 ). Although the overall structure still represents an occluded state, an unprecedented conformation is now observed for the SP members. The most evident differences occur in TM1 and TM7b, both of which straighten up upon C3361 association. Consequently, TM1e becomes an integral fragment of TM1 ( Figure 2 D). TM2 and TM4 in the N domain also undergo evident displacement away from the center of the structure ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Video S1 ).

Conformational Changes between Glucose- and C3361-Bound PfHT1, Related to Figures 2 and 3 The morph was generated using the structures of glucose- and C3361-bound PfHT1 as the starting and end frame. TM1e and the bent TM7b are colored orange.
Previous structural analyses of SP members suggest that the C domain, which plays a primary role in substrate coordination, exhibits local conformational changes exemplified by TM7 and TM10, whereas the N domain undergoes rigid-body rotation during the alternating access cycle ( Yan, 2017 69. Yan, N. A glimpse of membrane transport through structures-advances in the structural biology of the GLUT glucose transporters J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 :2710-2725 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intradomain rearrangements of the PfHT1 N domain observed here represents an important update to our mechanistic understanding of the SP and the MFS transporters.
The density corresponding to C3361 is well-resolved between the N and C domains ( Figure S3 B). Despite prominent differences between the glucose- and C3361-bound structures, coordination of the sugar moiety of C3361 is nearly identical to that of D-glucose by the conserved residues in PfHT1 ( Figure 3 A). However, the presence of the aliphatic tail has reshaped the central cavity, resulting in an additional pocket surrounding the end of the tail ( Figures 3 B and 3C; Video S1 ).
If PfHT1 had adopted the same conformation as in the glucose-bound form, the tail of C3361 would clash with TM2 and TM7b ( Figures 2 D and 3 B). As a result of the shift of TM1e, TM2, and TM7b, the aliphatic tail of C3361 is now surrounded by a number of hydrophobic residues on the extracellular halves of TM1, TM2, TM7b, and TM11 ( Figures 3 B and 3D).
Of particular importance, the pocket that encages the last five-carbon chain is not perfectly contoured with the linear chain. It is more spacious than the ligand, affording opportunities to further extend C3361 to occupy this additional pocket to improve potency and selectivity ( Figures 3 C and 3D). We were encouraged by this serendipitous structure discovery and set out to design derivatives of C3361 with improved potency and selectivity based on the PfHT1 complex structure.
The structure of the PfHT1-C3361 complex suggests a strategy of simultaneously occupying the allosteric pocket along with the substrate-binding site, which may increase both the affinity toward PfHT1 and selectivity over GLUTs. To prove this hypothesis, various C3361 derivatives with explorative structural modifications were designed, synthesized, and functionally examined ( Table 1 ).
Out of dozens of rationally designed compounds, three C3361 derivatives, designated 1a , 1b , and 1c , stood out in preliminary simulation ( Figure 4 A). In these three compounds, an aromatic group ( 1a , phenyl; 1b , 2-naphthyl) or a heteroaromatic group ( 1c , 6-quinolyl) of various sizes is attached to the distal terminus of the C 8 alkyl chain via an ether linker with an intention to explore the induced pocket in the PfHT1-C3361 complex.
Compounds 1a , 1b , and 1c were successfully prepared using a concise synthetic route (Supplemental Information). These three compounds were then examined for their inhibitory effects on PfHT1 using the counterflow assay. Consistently, improvement of potency was observed for all compounds, showing IC 50 values of 15.5 ± 1.3 μM for 1a , 2.37 ± 0.20 μM for 1b , and 0.513 ± 0.026 μM for 1c , respectively ( Figure 4 B; Table 1 ). These results are particularly promising not only because they represent 2-, 15-, and 64-fold increase, respectively, over C3361 ( Table 1 ), but also, this order of increasing potency of allyl- (C3361), phenyloxy- ( 1a ), naphthyloxy- ( 1b ), and quinolin-6-yloxyl ( 1c ) groups is in a good agreement with the estimated size of the allosteric pocket, lending support to the approach of targeting the second pocket ( Figures 4 A and 4B). More importantly, all three compounds retain the selectivity of PfHT1 over its human ortholog, GLUT1. At a concentration of 100 μM, the glucose-transport activity of GLUT1 was reduced by less than 10% by either 1a , 1b , or 1c ( Figure 4 B, right). Given the particularly promising inhibitory effects of compound 1c , we hereafter focused on this lead and rename it HTI-1 for HT-1 Inhibitor.
To shed light on the improved inhibitory potency of HTI-1 at a molecular level, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for HTI-1 using the C3361-bound PfHT1 as the structural basis. We first complemented the structure of PfHT1 in complex with C3361 by stitching the missing loops with segments grafted from the structure of the PfHT1-glucose complex. The complex between PfHT1 and HTI-1 retains a stable conformation throughout a 50-ns simulation in phospholipid bilayer, with the quinolin-6-yloxyl group remaining static in the allosteric pocket, suggesting a favorable binding mode ( Figures S4 A and S4B). Local shifts were observed for TM1, TM2, and TM7b, resulting in a noticeable reduction of the pocket size upon occupation by the quinolin-6-yloxyl group of HTI-1 ( Figure S4 C; Video S2 ). This reduction implied decent spatial complementarity, supporting a rational design of HTI-1 that simultaneously targets two distinct pockets in PfHT1.

The increased binding affinity of HTI-1 is also corroborated by the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) binding energy calculation ( Figure S4 D). HTI-1 appears to be H-bonded to Lys51, which can be further stabilized by Asp447 during the 50-ns simulation ( Figures 4 C and S4 E). These additional contacts may account for the increased potency of HTI-1 over 1a and 1b . To test this hypothesis, the IC 50 values of HTI-1 against PfHT1 mutants that contain a single point mutation, K51A, or a double mutation, K51A/D447A, were measured using the counterflow assay. Both mutations led to reduced potency of HTI-1 against PfHT1. Of particular note, the IC 50 of HTI-1 against PfHT1(K51A/D447A) decreased to the level nearly identical to that of compound 1b against WT PfHT1, confirming the contribution by the H-bonding to the increased potency of HTI-1 ( Figure 4 D).
To further profile these two binding pockets, a focused library of HTI-1 derivatives with various polymethylene linkers (C 6 for 2a , C 10 for 2b , and C 12 for 2c ) and sugar moieties (L-glucose for 3a and D-fructose for 3b ) were synthesized and examined ( Table 1 ). This structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation indicates that the polymethylene linker is optimal between eight and ten carbons, perhaps a length that can effectively position substituents to the distal pockets. Also, replacement of the D-glucose moiety (HTI-1) with either L-glucose ( 3a ) or D-fructose ( 3b ) resulted in dramatic reduction of potency ( Table 1 ). Taken together, these SAR results confirm a dual inhibition of the glucose binding site and the allosteric pocket induced by inhibitor binding, leading to a significantly higher potency of HTI-1 against PfHT1.
Next, we evaluated the antiparasitic potency of the HTI-1 derivatives against a drug-sensitive strain (3D7) and a multi-drug-resistant strain (Dd2) of P. falciparum using a phenotypic blood-stage growth inhibition assay. To demonstrate the on-target effects of the HTI-1 derivatives, we first compared their IC 50 values for PfHT1 inhibition and the EC 50 values obtained in the parasite growth inhibition assay. A good correlation between the two parameters ( r 2 = 0.91) was observed using six representative HTI-1 derivatives covering a range of activities ( Figure 5 A). This notable correlation strongly suggests that direct inhibition of PfHT1 by the HTI-1 derivatives causes the suppression of the parasite growth.
Another interesting note is that these HTI-1 derivatives with decent IC 50 were, by and large, equipotent to both Pf 3D7 and Pf Dd2 strains ( Figure 5 B), laying a solid foundation for future development of antimalarial drugs overcoming resistance. Furthermore, most of these derivatives showed low cytotoxicity to two mammalian cell lines, HepG2 and HEK93T/17 ( Figure 5 C). In particular, HTI-1 has demonstrated superior cytotoxicity profiles to its analogs with comparable parasite killing activities (e.g., compound 2b ), demonstrating promising drug development potential.
Next, we benchmarked the lead compound HTI-1 with MMV009085, the only compound from the influential Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) database that was suggested to target PfHT1 ( Kraft et al., 2016 32. Kraft, T.E. ∙ Heitmeier, M.R. ∙ Putanko, M. ... A novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based screen in high-throughput format to identify inhibitors of malarial and human glucose transporters Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2016; 60 :7407-7414 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). MMV009085 inhibited the transport activity of PfHT-1 with an IC 50 of 212 ± 39 μM ( Figure S5 A; Table 1 ). Still, the EC 50 values of MMV009085 in the parasite growth inhibition assay were 1.23 ± 0.04 μM against 3D7 and 0.720 ± 0.05 μM against Dd2, agreeing with reported values ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Table 1 ) ( Kraft et al., 2016 32. Kraft, T.E. ∙ Heitmeier, M.R. ∙ Putanko, M. ... A novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based screen in high-throughput format to identify inhibitors of malarial and human glucose transporters Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2016; 60 :7407-7414 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, MMV009085 displayed significant cytotoxicity with CC 50 values of 2.46 ± 0.03 μM and 1.92 ± 0.85 μM for HEK293T and HepG2 cells, respectively ( Figure 5 B). In contrast, HTI-1 showed notably higher anti-parasite potency with EC 50 values of 0.377 ± 0.027 μM against 3D7 and 0.398 ± 0.023 μM against Dd2. In fact, HTI-1 is more potent than the majority of more than 400 candidate drugs in the MMV database ( Figure S5 B) ( Spangenberg et al., 2013 56. Spangenberg, T. ∙ Burrows, J.N. ∙ Kowalczyk, P. ... The open access malaria box: a drug discovery catalyst for neglected diseases PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e62906 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the cytotoxicity of HTI-1 is substantially lower with a CC 50 greater than 50 μM ( Figures 5 B and 5C).
Finally, we found that the antiparasitic potency of HTI-1 depends on the glucose concentration in media. Conventionally, P. falciparum culture is maintained in RPMI 1640 medium that contains 11 mM of glucose, whereas the glucose concentration in human blood normally fluctuates between approximately 4 and 6.5 mM ( Hindmarsh and Geertsma, 2017 18. Hindmarsh, P.C. ∙ Geertsma, K. Glucose and cortisol Hindmarsh, P.C. ∙ Geertsma, K. (Editors) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Academic Press, 2017; 219-230 Crossref Google Scholar ). As HTI-1 competes with glucose for the binding to PfHT1, we tested the effects of glucose concentration on the potency of HTI-1 against parasite growth. HTI-1 showed significantly higher potency against Dd2 strain at the lower glucose concentration (EC 50 = 118 ± 7 nM with 2 mM glucose). By contrast, the potency of artemisinin is independent of glucose concentration ( Figure 5 D). These results not only suggested that the potency of HTI-1 may be underestimated in the presence of glucose rich media, but also indicated that the antiparasitic effects by HTI-1 is via PfHT1, further confirming its on-target effects.

Section: Discussion

Emerging resistance to frontline therapeutics underscores the urgent need for next-generation antimalarials that act via alternative molecular targets and mechanisms of action. The blockage of glucose uptake, a concept attempting to “starve out the malaria parasites,” represents an unconventional strategy for antimalarial drug discovery. For this, inhibitors that selectively inhibit glucose uptake into the parasite, but not human cells, are required. PfHT, the major hexose importer in P. falciparum , has attracted great interest, but the absence of structural insights has prevented rational design of its small molecule inhibitors.
Our structure of PfHT1 in complex with compound C3361, a selective inhibitor with moderate potency, has established a foundation for structure-guided drug discovery ( Figure 6 ). The inhibitor-induced allosteric pocket in a previously unobserved conformation of the SP proteins represents a serendipitous structural discovery. The underlying allosteric mechanism presents an innovative strategy to achieve selective inhibition of PfHT1 over its human homologs.
The discovery of the unique allosteric pocket induced by the binding of C3661, a previously described orthosteric PfHT1 inhibitor, prompted us to develop more potent and selective PfHT1 inhibitors. We rationally designed and synthesized C3661 derivatives that target the orthosteric and allosteric sites of PfHT1 simultaneously and identified a lead compound, HTI-1, in which the hydrophobic tail of C3361 was replaced with a flexible polymethylene linker with a distal 6-quinolyl substitution, with high potency and low cytotoxicity. Our findings reported here serve as proof of concept for an orthosteric-allosteric dual inhibition of PfHT1 and validate that PfHT1 as a druggable target for next-generation antimalarials.

Atomic coordinates of PfHT1 with glucose and C3361 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( http://www.rcsb.org ) under the accession codes 6M20 and 6M2L, respectively.
Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (GIBCO) at 27°C.
Strains of Plasmodium falciparum Dd2 (a multi-drug resistant strain) and 3D7 (a drug-sensitive strain) were a gift from the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Science. The erythrocytic stages of parasites were cultured by standard methods in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo) supplemented with human blood, 5.94 g/L HEPES (Thermo), 0.5% Albumax II (Thermo, GIBCO), 50 mg/L hypoxanthine (Sigma), 2.1 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), and 25 mg/L gentamicin (Sangon). Cultures were grown at 37°C in a gas mixture of 5% O 2 , 5% CO 2 , and 90% N 2 and regularly synchronized by 5% sorbitol (Sigma) treatment.
Mammalian cells (HEK293T/17 and HepG2) were obtained from the ATCC and cultured routinely in an atmosphere of 5% O 2 at 37°C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, GIBCO) with 10% (v/v) FBS (GIBCO) and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). For cytotoxicity assays, the test compounds in DMSO were dispensed into 384-well white, solid-bottom plates by Tecan D300e Digital Dispenser along with the control compound (puromycin).
The human glucose transporter GLUT1 (N45T) and GLUT3 (N43T) were expressed and purified following identical protocols as described previously ( Deng et al., 2014 12. Deng, D. ∙ Xu, C. ∙ Sun, P. ... Crystal structure of the human glucose transporter GLUT1 Nature. 2014; 510 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 13. Deng, D. ∙ Sun, P. ∙ Yan, C. ... Molecular basis of ligand recognition and transport by glucose transporters Nature. 2015; 526 :391-396 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Codon-optimized cDNA of full-length PfHT1 was synthesized and subcloned into modified pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal His 10 tag. All mutants were generated with a standard PCR-based strategy. The recombinant PfHT1 and mutants were expressed using the pFastBac baculovirus system (Invitrogen). Bacmids were generated in DH10Bac cells, followed by the transfection of Sf9 insect cells to generate and amplify baculoviruses.
After 72 h viral infection, the Sf9 cells were harvested and resuspended in the buffer containing 25 mM MES pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitors cocktail (aprotinin at 5 μg/mL, pepstatin at 1 μg/mL, and leupeptin at 5 μg/mL; Amresco). The overexpressed PfHT1 and mutants were extracted by 2% (w/v) n -dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) at 4°C for 2 h. The debris of cell membrane was precipitated by high-speed centrifugation (18,700 g ) at 4°C for 30 min and the supernatant was incubated with Ni 2+ -nitrilotriacetate affinity resin (Ni-NTA, QIAGEN) at 4°C for 30 min. The resin was rinsed with the buffer containing 25 mM MES pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, and 0.02% (w/v) DDM. The protein was eluted with wash buffer plus 270 mM imidazole. For crystallization, the wild type (WT) PfHT1 was concentrated to 15 mg/mL and digested by 10 mg/mL protease K (Sigma) with a 32:1 protein to protease K ratio (v/v) at 18°C for 30 min to remove the flexible segment on the N terminus. The proteolytic reaction was terminated by addition of 1 mM PMSF before size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the buffer containing 25 mM MES pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, and selected detergent. Peak fractions were collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further experiments. For biochemical analysis, both WT and mutants were directly applied to gel filtration without protease K digestion.
Liposomes and proteoliposomes were prepared as described previously ( Deng et al., 2015 13. Deng, D. ∙ Sun, P. ∙ Yan, C. ... Molecular basis of ligand recognition and transport by glucose transporters Nature. 2015; 526 :391-396 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiang et al., 2019 23.

Sun, L. ∙ Zeng, X. ∙ Yan, C. ... Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of glucose transporters GLUT1-4 Nature. 2012; 490 :361-366 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti) was dissolved to 20 mg/mL in KPM 6.5 buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.5, 2 mM MgSO 4 ) plus 50 mM D-glucose. After incubation with 1% n -octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (β-OG, Anatrace) at 4°C for 30 min, liposomes were mixed with 200 μg/mL indicated proteins and incubated for another 1 h at 4°C. β-OG was removed by incubation with 400 mg/mL Bio-Beads SM2 (Bio-Rad) overnight. Proteoliposomes were frozen and thawed in liquid nitrogen for 5 times and extruded through 0.4 μm membrane filter (Millipore). To remove remaining glucose, the homogenized proteoliposomes were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h and the precipitant was rinsed with ice-cold KPM 6.5 buffer twice. Finally, the proteoliposomes were resuspended to 100 mg/mL with ice-cold KPM 6.5 buffer for counterflow assay.
Counterflow assays were performed at 25°C. For each assay, 2 μL of 100 mg/mL proteoliposomes preloaded with 50 mM D-glucose were mixed with 100 μL KPM6.5 buffer containing 1 μCi D-[2- 3 H]-glucose (PerkinElmer), equivalent of 0.427 μM D-[2- 3 H]-glucose with the specific radioactivity of 23.4 Ci/mmol. After 30 s, the mixed solution was aspirated through 0.22 μm membrane filters (Millipore) and rinsed with 2 mL ice-cold KPM 6.5 buffer. The filter was incubated with 0.5 mL Optiphase HISAFE 3 (PerkinElmer) overnight before liquid scintillation counting using MicroBeta JET (PerkinElmer).
Time-course experiments showed that accumulation of D-[2- 3 H]-glucose was roughly linear within the first 30 s. To determine the K m and V max of D-glucose transport by PfHT1, the initial velocities were measured at 15 s. The glucose concentration in external solution was adjusted using non-radiolabeled substrate. The data were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation, V = ( V max [D-glucose])/ ( K m + [D-glucose]), in Prism Software version 8 (GraphPad).
To test inhibitors, proteoliposomes were pre-incubated with 100 μM indicated inhibitors for 30 min on ice. Then 2 μL proteoliposomes was added to 98 μL KPM buffer containing 1 μCi D-[2- 3 H]-glucose and 100 μM inhibitors. The rest of the protocol is identical to that described above. To determine IC 50 of the inhibitors, the concentration of tested inhibitors was varied as indicated.
All experiments were repeated for three times. Error bars represent SD. All data were processed in Prism Software version 8 (GraphPad).
WT PfHT1 purified in the presence of 0.4% (w/v) n -nonyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (β-NG, Anatrace) and 50 mM glucose was crystallized using hanging-drop vapor diffusion method with the mother liquid containing 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M MES pH 5.7, 26% (w/v) PEG400 and 2% (w/v) benzamidine hydrochloride. The crystals were grown at 18°C for about 1 week before reaching full size.
For lipidic cubic phase crystallization of the PfHT1-C3361 complex, the WT protein purified in 0.06% (w/v) 6-cyclohexyl-1-hexyl-β-D-maltoside (Cymal-6, Anatrace) and 0.01% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate tris salt (CHS, Anatrace) was concentrated to ∼40 mg/mL and pre-incubated with 50 mM C3361 at 4°C for 1 h before mixing with monoolein (Sigma) in 2:3 protein to lipid ratio (w/w) ( Caffrey and Cherezov, 2009 10. Caffrey, M. ∙ Cherezov, V. Crystallizing membrane proteins using lipidic mesophases Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :706-731 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then 45 nL meso phase was mixed with 400 nL well buffer for each condition on glass sandwich plates using an LCP crystallization robot (Gryphon, Art Robbins Instruments). It is notable that 2 to 3 layers of spacers were stuck to the glass sandwich plates to ensure the growth of crystals ( Li et al., 2011 39. Li, D. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Caffrey, M. Crystallizing membrane proteins in lipidic mesophases. A host lipid screen Cryst. Growth Des. 2011; 11 :530-537 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). The best diffracting crystals were obtained in the condition with 0.1 M NH 4 Cl, 0.1 M Na 3 Citrate pH 5.2 and 28% PEG500MME at 20°C. Crystals, which appeared after 2 days and grew to full size in one week, were collected using MicroMesh (M3-L18SP-50; MiTeGen) and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data were collected at SPring-8 beamline BL32XU using an EIGER X 9M detector. The hanging drop crystals were exposed under 10 × 15 μm micro-focus beam with a wavelength of 1.0 Å. Diffraction datasets were collected manually for 180°-360°. For LCP crystals, wedges of 10° were collected for each single crystal using 10 × 15 μm micro-focus beam with 1.0 Å wavelength. The oscillation angle was set to 0.1° per frame. Datasets of LCP crystals were automatically collected by ZOO system ( Hirata et al., 2019 19. Hirata, K. ∙ Yamashita, K. ∙ Ueno, G. ... ZOO: an automatic data-collection system for high-throughput structure analysis in protein microcrystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :138-150 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). KAMO was used for first-round automatic data processing ( Yamashita et al., 2018 67. Yamashita, K. ∙ Hirata, K. ∙ Yamamoto, M. KAMO: towards automated data processing for microcrystals Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :441-449 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Datasets with good diffraction were manually picked out based on R-merge. After removal of poor diffracted datasets, all datasets were integrated and scaled using XDS ( Kabsch, 2010 28. Kabsch, W. Xds Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12932) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by anisotropy analysis through UCLA Diffraction Anisotropy Server ( Strong et al., 2006 59. Strong, M. ∙ Sawaya, M.R. ∙ Wang, S. ... Toward the structural genomics of complexes: crystal structure of a PE/PPE protein complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :8060-8065 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate anisotropy-truncated datasets. Further processing was carried out using the CCP4 suite ( Bailey, 1994 5. Bailey, S., Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50 :760-763 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phase was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER ( McCoy et al., 2007 41. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (16083) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a modified GLUT3 structure (PDB code: 4ZW9 ), whose residues were modified by CHAINSAW ( Stein, 2008 58. Stein, N. CHAINSAW: a program for mutating pdb files used as templates in molecular replacement Journal of Applied Crystallography. 2008; 41 :641-643 Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar ) in CCP4 suite the corresponding sequence of PfHT1, as search model. The structural model was rebuilt in COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 14. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refined with PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2002 3. Adams, P.D. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Hung, L.W. ... PHENIX: building new software for automated crystallographic structure determination Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58 :1948-1954 Crossref Scopus (3845) PubMed Google Scholar ). Statistics for data collection and structure refinement is summarized in Supplementary information, Table S1 .
3- O -((undec-10-en)-1-yl)-D-glucose (C3361) was synthesized from condensation of 11-bromo-1-undecene and diacetone-D-glucose, and followed by removal of protecting groups using a modified procedure of previously established methods ( Ikekawa et al., 1987 21. Ikekawa, T. ∙ Irinoda, K. ∙ Saze, K. ... Studies on synthesis of 3- O -alkyl-D-glucose and 3- O -alkyl-D-allose derivatives and their biological activities Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1987; 35 :2894-2899 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). For preparation of other compounds, 3- O -(8-bromooctyl)-1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-D-glucofuranose was first synthesized by condensation of 1,8-dibromooctane and diacetone-D-glucose. Then, diacetone-D-glucose (5.0 g, 19.2 mmol) was dissolved in 25 mL anhydrous N, N -dimethylformamide (DMF) in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask, and sodium hydride in mineral oil (60%) (1.2 g, 28.7 mmol), tetra- n -butylammonium iodide (1.0 g, 2.7 mmol) were added under argon in small portions over a period of 5 min. The mixture was stirred for 30 min in ice-water bath. Then 1,8-dibromooctane (5.3 ml, 28.7 mmol) was added slowly. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 24 h. Upon completion of the reaction, organic solvent was removed. The resulting precipitant was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The crude was then purified by column chromatography on silica gel (8% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether) to furnish 3- O -(8-bromooctyl)-1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-D-glucofuranose (compound 1 ) with a 48.4% yield (4.2 g, 9.3 mmol). Compound 1 (964 mg, 2.1 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL anhydrous DMF and 6-hydroxyquinoline (295 mg, 2.0 mmol) and potassium carbonate (420 mg, 3.0 mmol) were then added. The mixture was stirred at 70°C for 10 h followed by the removal of organic solvent which led to products precipitated in water. The resulting residue was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The crude was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether) to afford 3- O -(8-(quinolin-6-yloxy)octyl)-1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-D-glucofuranose (compound 2 ) with a 84.6% yield (887 mg, 1.7 mmol). Compound 2 (887 mg, 1.7 mmol) was placed in 50 mL round-bottomed flask, and trifluoroacetic acid (7.2 ml), water (0.8 ml) were then added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 40 min following by purification using column chromatography on silica gel (10% methanol in dichloromethane) to afford 3- O -(8-(quinolin-6-yloxy)octyl)-D-glucose (HTI-1) in 98% yield (725 mg, 1.7 mmol). Other compounds were synthesized following the similar procedure. All final products were validated with purity > 95% purity by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometric (HMS) analyses. The final products were reconstituted in 100% DMSO prior to dilutions in aqueous buffers or cell culture medium for the following assays. Please refer to the Supplemental Methods for details.
After removal of ligand from the C3361-PfHT1 complex, compound 1a , 1b , and HTI-1 were docked using Schrödinger Suite 2018-1 ( Schrödinger, LLC, 2018 52. Schrödinger, LLC, 2018. Schrödinger Release 2018-1. Schrödinger, LLC. https://www.schrodinger.com/releases/release-2018-1 . Google Scholar ). The initial 3D conformation of ligands were generated from their 2D structures using the LigPrep program ( Sastry et al., 2013 50. Sastry, G.M. ∙ Adzhigirey, M. ∙ Day, T. ... Protein and ligand preparation: parameters, protocols, and influence on virtual screening enrichments J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2013; 27 :221-234 Crossref Scopus (3994) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the OPLS3 force field ( Harder et al., 2016 17. Harder, E. ∙ Damm, W. ∙ Maple, J. ... OPLS3: A force field providing broad coverage of drug-like small molecules and proteins J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016; 12 :281-296 Crossref Scopus (2252) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protein structure was then processed by Protein Preparation Wizard using the coordinates of PfHT1-C3361 complex as the input. Molecular docking was performed using the extra-precision docking (Glide XP) within the Glide program. The binding free energies of all different poses from XP docking outputs were carried out using Prime-MM/GBSA module.
The ligand-bound PfHT1 systems with the Cys61-Cys70 disulfide bond were built with the CHARMM-GUI online membrane builder ( Brooks et al., 2009 9.

CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder toward realistic biological membrane simulations J. Comput. Chem. 2014; 35 :1997-2004 Crossref Scopus (1593) PubMed Google Scholar ). The missing loop L1-2 (residue index 62-69) in the crystal structure of C3361-PfHT1 complex was remodeled and refined by Rosetta 2018.33 using Generalized Kinematic Closure algorithm ( Bhardwaj et al., 2016 7.

Sub-angstrom accuracy in protein loop reconstruction by robotics-inspired conformational sampling Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :551-552 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ). Loop L5-6 (residue index 184-204) was rebuilt using the structure of glucose-PfHT1 complex as a template and refined by Rosetta 2018.33. The HTI-1 binding pose was selected from docking results, followed by the insertion of the protein into a lipid bilayer composed of 200 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) molecules solvated with a 22.5 Å-thick layer of 150 mM NaCl aqueous solution, resulting in a box with approximate dimensions of 92 × 92 × 122 Å 3 containing 96,530 atoms.
To investigate the stability of the docked PTI-1 poses, 50-ns simulations were performed in triplicate with the PTI-1-bound PfHT1 complex. After 5000 steps of minimization, the systems were equilibrated in six steps as default from CHARMM-GUI lipid bilayer outputs ( Brooks et al., 2009 9.

Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79 :926-935 Crossref Scopus (33497) Google Scholar ) for water. All simulations were carried out using isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensembles at a constant temperature of 303.15 K.
RMSD values and distances were calculated using MDTraj 1.9.3 ( McGibbon et al., 2015 42. McGibbon, R.T. ∙ Beauchamp, K.A. ∙ Harrigan, M.P. ... MDTraj: a modern open library for the analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories Biophys. J. 2015; 109 :1528-1532 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1298) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gaussian kernel density estimation of the distance distributions was performed with SciPy ( Virtanen et al., 2020 63. Virtanen, P. ∙ Gommers, R. ∙ Oliphant, T.E. ..., SciPy 1.0 Contributors SciPy 1.0: fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :261-272 Crossref Scopus (18328) PubMed Google Scholar ). To estimate the binding free energy of HTI-1 and C3361, we performed MD simulation starting with the C3361-bound PfHT1 crystal structure following the same protocol. We then performed MM-PBSA calculations on MD simulation trajectories of C3361-bound and HTI-1-bound systems including explicit membrane respectively, with the g_mmpbsa tool ( Baker et al., 2001 6. Baker, N.A. ∙ Sept, D. ∙ Joseph, S. ... Electrostatics of nanosystems: application to microtubules and the ribosome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Model. 2014; 54 :1951-1962 Crossref Scopus (3379) PubMed Google Scholar ) using solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) as the model for non-polar solvation energy.
For the in vitro assay, the test compounds in DMSO were printed in duplicate into 384-well black, clear-bottom plates by Tecan D300e Digital Dispenser along with dihydroartemisinin as killing control. Synchronized ring-stage parasites suspension at 1.0% parasitemia and 0.8% hematocrit was dispensed into the assay plates and incubated for 72 h at 37°C. SYBR Green I fluorescent dye (Invitrogen) in lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (Sangon Biotech), 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Scientific), 0.16% (w/v) Saponin (Sangon Biotech), 1.6% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sangon Biotech)] was added, and after overnight incubation for optimal staining, fluorescence intensity was measured (485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission) by Envision (PerkinElmer). EC 50 values were determined using a nonlinear regression curve fit in Prism Software version 8 (GraphPad). The reported values were the results of two technical and at least three biological replicates.
Assay media containing glucose at 2 mM, 4 mM, 6 mM, 8 mM, 10 mM and 11 mM were prepared by adding glucose (Sigma) to RPMI 1640 with no glucose (Thermo), adjusted to 7.4 pH and sterile-filtered. Ring-stage Dd2 parasite suspension was prepared in these assay media and cultured for 48 h at 37°C. EC 50 values were determined in the same way as described above.
HEK293T/17 cells or HepG2 cells were seeded into the assay plates at approximately 2,000 cells per well and 2,500 cells per well respectively and incubated for 72 h. The viability was measured using Cell-Titer Glo (Promega) following its instruction, and luminescence signals were measured using an Envision instrument (PerkinElmer). CC 50 values were fitted to a nonlinear regression curve using Prism Software version 8 (GraphPad). The reported values were the results of two technical and at least three biological replicates.
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism Software version 8 (GraphPad). To determine the K m and V max of D-glucose transport by PfHT1, the data were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation, V = ( V max [D-glucose])/ ( K m + [D-glucose]) and presented in Figure 1 . IC 50 values of the inhibitors, presented in Figures 2 , 4 , and Table 1 , were determined using a nonlinear regression curve fit. The blood-stage potency (EC 50 ) against two P. falciparum strains (3D7 and Dd2) and cell cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) against different human cell lines (HEK293T/17 and HepG2) is presented in Figure 5 . All experiments were independently repeated for three times. Data are presented as mean ± SD. No new method was applied to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach.
