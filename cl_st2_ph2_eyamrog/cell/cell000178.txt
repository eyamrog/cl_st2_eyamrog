Title: Diet Diurnally Regulates Small Intestinal Microbiome-Epithelial-Immune Homeostasis and Enteritis


Abstract: Summary

Throughout a 24-h period, the small intestine (SI) is exposed to diurnally varying food- and microbiome-derived antigenic burdens but maintains a strict immune homeostasis, which when perturbed in genetically susceptible individuals, may lead to Crohn disease. Herein, we demonstrate that dietary content and rhythmicity regulate the diurnally shifting SI epithelial cell (SIEC) transcriptional landscape through modulation of the SI microbiome. We exemplify this concept with SIEC major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is diurnally modulated by distinct mucosal-adherent SI commensals, while supporting downstream diurnal activity of intra-epithelial IL-10 + lymphocytes regulating the SI barrier function. Disruption of this diurnally regulated diet-microbiome-MHC class II-IL-10-epithelial barrier axis by circadian clock disarrangement, alterations in feeding time or content, or epithelial-specific MHC class II depletion leads to an extensive microbial product influx, driving Crohn-like enteritis. Collectively, we highlight nutritional features that modulate SI microbiome, immunity, and barrier function and identify dietary, epithelial, and immune checkpoints along this axis to be potentially exploitable in future Crohn disease interventions.

Section: Introduction

Diet shapes intestinal physiology, through a variety of microbiome-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, most nutritional influences have been primarily studied in the large intestine and in the context of metabolic health ( Canfora et al., 2015 14. Canfora, E.E. ∙ Jocken, J.W. ∙ Blaak, E.E.

In contrast, mechanistic understanding of dietary modulation of small intestine (SI) physiology, where the majority of dietary exposures and interactions take place remains elusive. The SI epithelial layer, comprising distinct SI epithelial cells (SIECs) and resident intra-epithelial T cell lymphocytes (IELs), is constantly challenged with extreme shifts in dietary influences throughout the course of a day. During waking hours, peaking nutrient availability mandates rapid adaptation of SIEC absorptive functions, balanced with immune tolerance toward increased antigenic burdens associated with food intake. Opposite conditions are present during the resting phase. The crosstalk between SIECs and IELs includes SIEC uptake of luminal antigens ( Büning et al., 2005 12.

Invest. 1997; 100 :204-215 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ), presentation to T cells ( Vezys et al., 2000 67. Vezys, V. ∙ Olson, S. ∙ Lefrançois, L.

T Helper Cell Cytokines Modulate Intestinal Stem Cell Renewal and Differentiation Cell. 2018; 175 :1307-1320 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, how SIECs and IELs cooperate in coping with the daily fluctuations in food intake and related antigenic exposures, maintaining the crucial equilibrium between the host’s nutritional and immune demands, remains largely unknown.
A breakdown of this poorly understood SIEC circadian adaptation to changing environmental cues may lead to immune dysregulation, culminating in immunopathology among individuals with underlying genetic susceptibilities to auto-inflammatory disorders. For example, Celiac disease is characterized by an uncontrolled auto-inflammation in genetically predisposed individuals, which is driven by a gluten-containing diet ( Lázár-Molnar and Snyder, 2018 39. Lázár-Molnár, E. ∙ Snyder, M. The Role of Human Leukocyte Antigen in Celiac Disease Diagnostics Clin. Lab. Med. 2018; 38 :655-668 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ameliorated by gluten-free diet ( Cummins et al., 1991 20. Cummins, A.G. ∙ Penttila, I.A. ∙ Labrooy, J.T. ... Recovery of the small intestine in coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet: changes in intestinal permeability, small bowel morphology and T-cell activity J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1991; 6 :53-57 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has long served as an empiric management therapy of pediatric Crohn disease (CD) ( Ashton et al., 2019 3. Ashton, J.J. ∙ Gavin, J. ∙ Beattie, R.M. Exclusive enteral nutrition in Crohn’s disease: Evidence and practicalities Clin. Nutr. 2019; 38 :80-89 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the mechanism by which dietary interventions help in shaping the SI immunity in homeostasis and in CD remains unknown.
Likewise, most gut microbiome research has been predominantly focused on the large intestinal microbial community and its proxy, the fecal microbiome, while modulatory dietary activities related to the distinct SI microbiome ( Suez et al., 2018 57. Suez, J. ∙ Zmora, N. ∙ Zilberman-Schapira, G. ...

In the large intestine, circadian rhythm constitutes a major organizational principle of homeоstatic diet-host-microbiome cooperation ( Chaix et al., 2014 17. Chaix, A. ∙ Zarrinpar, A. ∙ Miu, P. ...

Diet and feeding pattern affect the diurnal dynamics of the gut microbiome Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :1006-1017 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (636) PubMed Google Scholar ), while breach of large intestinal microbiome circadian homeostasis leads to a concomitant microbial and host dysfunction, contributing to metabolic disease ( Thaiss et al., 2014 60. Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Zeevi, D. ∙ Levy, M. ...

Whether similar circadian organizational principles apply to SI host-microbiome cooperative adaptation to diurnally shifting environmental conditions, including diet, remains unknown. In this study, we sought to explore these interactions and their potential impacts on SI immune homeostasis and risk of development of CD.

Section: Results

Throughout this section, results pertaining to pooled experiments derive from independent repeats performed under identical conditions, available at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wp2wt38pdg/draft?a=1bb5fe57-453f-4b05-b558-3207bb705b8a . We began our investigation by characterizing the transcriptomic landscape (by RNA sequencing) of sorted jejunal small intestinal epithelial cells (SIECs, CD45 – EpCAM HI ) of male 12-week-old C57BL6 mice, kept in specific pathogen-free (SPF) versus germ-free (GF) conditions, or collected at the peak (ZT12) versus trough (ZT0) time points of SI absorptive activity ( Pan and Hussain, 2009 48. Pan, X. ∙ Hussain, M.M. Clock is important for food and circadian regulation of macronutrient absorption in mice J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50 :1800-1813 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). SIECs were further compared to colonic intestinal epithelial cells ( Figure 1 A). Transcriptome comparison between SIECs collected from SPF mice at the peak (ZT12) versus trough (ZT0) of SI absorptive activity revealed 114 changing Gene Ontology (GO) terms (q < 0.1), suggesting a diurnal nature of SIEC gene expression ( Figure S1 A). Comparison between SIECs collected at SPF versus GF conditions at ZT0 identified 254 GO terms (q < 0.1) to be differentially regulated by the microbiome ( Figure S1 B). Comparison between jejunal and colonic IECs at ZT0 revealed 57 differentially expressed SI-specific GO terms (q < 0.1, Figure S1 C). The trilateral analysis of all three conditions (SI versus colon; GF versus SPF and ZT0 versus ZT12) revealed 16 GO terms to constitute common denominators that potentially represented diurnally adapting transcriptomic pathways that were specific to SI and modulated by time and the microbiome ( Figure 1 A). Among them were GO terms of circadian clock machinery, pathways responsible for absorption, intracellular transport, and antimicrobial defense. Surprisingly, several of the common denominator GO terms included pathways related to antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II complex ( Figure 1 A). Indeed, SIECs were previously suggested to act as non-classic antigen-presenting cells that closely interact with lymphocyte populations of SI through MHC class II, thereby directing CD4 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cell differentiation ( Westendorf et al., 2009 69. Westendorf, A.M. ∙ Fleissner, D. ∙ Groebe, L. ... CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell expansion induced by antigen-driven interaction with intestinal epithelial cells independent of local dendritic cells Gut. 2009; 58 :211-219 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), while reciprocally, T helper cell-derived cytokines have been reported to direct the development of MHC class II + SI stem cells ( Biton et al., 2018 7. Biton, M. ∙ Haber, A.L. ∙ Rogel, N. ... T Helper Cell Cytokines Modulate Intestinal Stem Cell Renewal and Differentiation Cell. 2018; 175 :1307-1320 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, SIEC MHC-class-II-mediated activity was shown to be induced by the gut microbiome and play a critical role in graft versus host disease ( Koyama et al., 2019 34. Koyama, M. ∙ Mukhopadhyay, P. ∙ Schuster, I.S. ... MHC Class II Antigen Presentation by the Intestinal Epithelium Initiates Graft-versus-Host Disease and Is Influenced by the Microbiota Immunity Immunity. 2019; 51 :885-898 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next examined the baseline frequency of MHC-class-II-expressing mature intestinal cells (CD45 – EpCAM HI ) along the gastro-intestinal tract of ad libitum normal chow (NC)-fed 8-week-old male C57BL6 mice, at peak (ZT12) or trough (ZT0) time points ( Figures 1 B–1D, pooled results, three independent repeats). The frequency of MHC class II + SIECs was significantly higher at ZT12 as compared to ZT0. In contrast to the SI, the cecum and colon showed no such temporal expression differences and a much lower MHC class II + SIEC frequency. To exclude a vivarium-specific or a strain-specific effect, we further compared the frequency of MHC II + SIECs between wild-type (WT) male, 8-week-old C57BL6 mice that were housed at our vivarium (Weizmann Institute of Science) for more than ten generations, to that of 8-week-old C57BL6 mice purchased from two independent commercial vendors (Jackson Laboratory, Figure S1 D, and Envigo, Figure S1 E), as well as to gender- and age-matched outbred Swiss Webster mice housed at our facility ( Figure S1 F). Indeed, the frequency of MHC class II + SIECs exhibited a temporally shifting pattern across vivaria and genetic strains. These results suggested that a subpopulation of MHC class II + SIEC may feature a diurnally regulated MHC class II expression profile.
In vivo examination of the frequency of MHC class II + SIECs collected every 4 h throughout two consecutive 24-h cycles in male, 10-week-old C57BL6 mice confirmed that SIEC MHC class II protein expression features a diurnally oscillating pattern (meta cycle Lomb-Scargle [LS] p = 0.0231, Figure 1 E, pooled results, four independent repeats; permutation test [PT] p = 0.0009, Figure 1 F). Likewise, at the mRNA level, expression levels of a MHC class II representative gene H2-AB1 were highest at ZT4 and minimal at ZT20 and featured a diurnal pattern (LS p = 0.0438, PT p = 0.0009, Figures S1 G and S1H). In contrast, SIEC expression of H1-K1 gene, a MHC class I member ( Figures S1 I and S1J, LS p = 0.9882; PT p = 0.1904), as well as that of interferon (IFN)-γ ( Figures S2 A and S2B, LS p = 0.8053; PT p = 0.2121), and EpCAM (protein level expression, Figures S2 C and S2D, LS p = 0.9915; PT p = 0.5444; mRNA level expression, Figures S2 E and S2F, LS p = 0.7460; PT p = 0.0766) did not exhibit diurnal oscillations. Overall, these results suggest that, in contrast to colonic IECs, EpCAM HI SIECs express MHC class II at steady state, and a large subpopulation of SIECs exhibits diurnal patterns in levels of MHC class II expression on both protein and mRNA levels.
We next set out to spatially define the oscillating MHC class II + SIEC subpopulation, since SIEC subsets specialize in various tasks along a villus height, including anti-microbial defense at the bottom of the crypt, absorptive function at the middle of the villi, and immunomodulation at the top of the villi ( Moor et al., 2018 46. Moor, A.E. ∙ Harnik, Y. ∙ Ben-Moshe, S. ... Spatial Reconstruction of Single Enterocytes Uncovers Broad Zonation along the Intestinal Villus Axis Cell. 2018; 175 :1156-1167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) performed at the trough (ZT0) and peak (ZT8) of SIEC MHC class II expression on the jejunum of WT male, 8-week-old C57BL6 mice demonstrated that the distribution of H2-AB1 mRNA is zonated along the length of villi in a time-specific manner. The highest concentration of mRNA molecules localized to the upper third of villi at ZT8, and to the middle of villi at ZT0 ( Figures 1 G and 1H), suggesting that the temporally oscillating SIEC MHC class II + population may be involved in nutrient absorption, which occurs within the same region at a similar time range ( Moor et al., 2017 45.

Circadian variation in the propagation velocity of the migrating motor complex Gastroenterology. 1986; 91 :926-930 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ) and intestinal blood outflow to the liver ( Lemmer and Nold, 1991 40. Lemmer, B. ∙ Nold, G. Circadian changes in estimated hepatic blood flow in healthy subjects Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1991; 32 :627-629 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, SIEC E-cadherin expression distribution mirrored that of H2-AB1 ( Figure 1 I; Figure S2 G). Intracellularly, H2-AB1 mRNA molecules were concentrated at the apical side of SIECs ( Figures 1 J and 1K). Indeed, H2-AB1 was among the 30% most highly expressed polar localized mRNAs molecules within IECs ( Moor et al., 2018 46. Moor, A.E. ∙ Harnik, Y. ∙ Ben-Moshe, S. ... Spatial Reconstruction of Single Enterocytes Uncovers Broad Zonation along the Intestinal Villus Axis Cell. 2018; 175 :1156-1167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ), with higher mRNA concentration noted in the ribosome-enriched apical cell side, a subcellular locality previously suggested to allow IECs to rapidly respond to external stimuli such as food intake ( Moor et al., 2017 45. Moor, A.E. ∙ Golan, M. ∙ Massasa, E.E. ... Global mRNA polarization regulates translation efficiency in the intestinal epithelium Science. 2017; 357 :1299-1303 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given the diurnal MHC class II activity noted in SIECs, we next set out to determine whether intact circadian clocks of the host are required for diurnal fluctuations of SIEC MHC class II expression. Toward this aim, we utilized both genetic and environmental models of circadian clock disruption to examine the SIEC MHC class II + population. The frequency of MHC class II + SIECs was examined every 6 h throughout two consecutive 24-h cycles in male, 8-week-old Period 1/2 double knockout (Per1/2 DKO) mice, which are deficient in core circadian clock genes and characterized by arrhythmic feeding ( Bae et al., 2001 5. Bae, K. ∙ Jin, X. ∙ Maywood, E.S. ... Differential functions of mPer1, mPer2, and mPer3 in the SCN circadian clock Neuron. 2001; 30 :525-536 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (760) PubMed Google Scholar ), as compared to age- and gender-matched circadian clock-sufficient WT C57BL6 mice. Indeed, diurnal pattern of SIEC MHC class II expression was opposite in Per1/2 DKO mice compared to WT mice in both protein ( Figures 2 A and 2B, LS p = 0.1849; PT p = 0.0028, pooled results, two independent repeats; Figure S2 H) and mRNA levels ( Figures S2 I and S2J, LS p = 0.147; PT p = 0.0013), with no diurnal changes noted in expression of the epithelial marker EpCAM ( Figures S3 A and S3B, LS p = 0.878; PT p = 0.6626). Similarly, examination of MHC class II + SIEC frequency in jet-lagged mice, subjected to 4 weeks of regular re-adaptation to an 8-h phase shift in light/dark cycle ( Figure 2 C), demonstrated a loss of diurnal pattern of SIEC MHC class II expression at ZT0 and ZT8 compared to control mice ( Figure 2 D, pooled results, three independent repeats).
As circadian clocks in mammals feature a hierarchical two-tier structure, featuring central hypothalamic circadian clocks and peripheral circadian clocks within each cell of the body, we next examined whether the diurnal MHC class II activity of SIECs requires endogenous SIEC clocks. Toward this aim, we generated intestinal epithelial specific knockout of Bmal1—a key member of circadian clock machinery, which featured an intact SIEC MHC class II protein expression at both trough (ZT0) and peak (ZT8) time points ( Figure 2 E, pooled results, three independent repeats). We next examined whether feeding rhythmicity might serve as the mechanism for the entrainment of diurnal SIEC MHC class II activity. Time-restricted feeding (TRF), limiting food access of 8-week-old WT and arrhythmic Per1/2 DKO male mice exclusively to the dark phase (night-fed group, NF) or to the light phase (day-fed group, DF) of a 24-h cycle for 4 weeks, uncovered a feeding-dependent phase-shift in diurnal MHC class II expression in WT mice, and a restored rhythmic SIEC MHC class II expression in Per1/2 DKO mice ( Figure 2 F, pooled results, two independent repeats). These results suggested that feeding rhythmicity may contribute to diurnal rhythmicity entrainment of SIEC MHC class II expression.
To uncover whether compositional dietary alterations, complementary to the above temporal dietary cues, may shape the diurnal expression pattern of SIEC MHC class II, we determined the in vivo SIEC MHC class II expression pattern in C57BL6, male 12-week-old mice fed ad libitum high-fat diet (HFD), containing 60% of calories in fat versus NC for 4 weeks at ZT0 and ZT8. Indeed, a dietary switch from NC to HFD led to a marked reduction on the protein frequency of MHC class II + SIECs at ZT8 to ZT0 levels ( Figure 2 G, pooled results, four independent repeats). Likewise, a repetitive 4-h measurement of MHC class II expression throughout a 48-h period upon transition to HFD demonstrated an overall reduction of SIEC MHC class II expression and a loss of the diurnal pattern on both protein ( Figures 2 H and 2I, HFD LS p = 0.9999; PT p = 0.5030 pooled results, two independent repeats) and mRNA levels ( Figures S3 C and S3D, HFD LS p = 0.5584; PT p = 0.2679), with no changes noted in expression of the epithelial marker EpCAM ( Figures S3 E and S3F, HFD LS p = 0.8519; PT p = 0.5887). To dissociate indirect effects of HFD on diurnal MHC class II expression mediated by its impact on the timing of feeding in mice, from its direct effects on rhythmic MHC class II expression, we applied time-restricted feeding (TRF) to HFD-fed mice ( Figures 2 J and 2K). While TRF induced weight loss ( Figure 2 J), it did not reverse the HFD-mediated suppression of SIEC MHC class II expression ( Figure 2 K), suggesting that the effects of HFD on SIEC MHC class II can be predominantly attributed to its dietary composition rather than its indirect effects on feeding behavior. Collectively, these results suggest that feeding rhythmicity and dietary content both act as regulators of diurnal SIEC MHC class II expression.
We next sought to decode the mechanism by which dietary interventions modulate SIEC MHC class II expression. One such mechanism may include regulation by the intestinal microbiome ( Thaiss et al., 2015 61. Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Zeevi, D. ∙ Levy, M. ... A day in the life of the meta-organism: diurnal rhythms of the intestinal microbiome and its host Gut Microbes. 2015; 6 :137-142 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 62.

Microbiota Diurnal Rhythmicity Programs Host Transcriptome Oscillations Cell. 2016; 167 :1495-1510 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (565) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we found that, similarly to large intestinal community ( Thaiss et al., 2014 60. Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Zeevi, D. ∙ Levy, M. ... Transkingdom control of microbiota diurnal oscillations promotes metabolic homeostasis Cell. 2014; 159 :514-529 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (932) PubMed Google Scholar ), the SI microbiome undergoes time-of-day-specific changes in its composition, both in the lumen ( Figures S3 G and S3I) and mucosal fraction ( Figures S3 H and S3J). To test whether the SI microbiome participates in regulation of SIEC MHC class II, we examined diurnally shifting SIEC MHC class II expression under microbiome disruptive conditions, in either 12-week-old C57BL6 male GF mice or gender-and age-matched mice treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotics cocktail consisting of ampicillin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and neomycin (AVMN) in drinking water for 4 weeks. In both conditions, the frequency of MHC class II + SIECs was reduced, and the diurnal pattern of expression lost, as compared to non-microbiome-disrupted controls ( Figure 3 A, pooled results, two independent repeats; Figure S4 A). To corroborate these findings, we examined SIEC MHC class II expression every 4 h throughout two consecutive 24-h cycles in 12-week-old GF male mice and in age- and gender-matched AVMN-treated male mice compared to non-microbiome-disrupted controls. While control SPF mice exhibited a SIEC MHC class II diurnal pattern (LS p = 0.0496; PT p = 0.0009), GF mice (LS p = 0.9574; PT p = 0.7474) and AVMN-treated mice (LS p = 0.3578; PT p = 0.1730) featured a reduced MHC class II + SIECs frequency and an absent diurnal pattern of expression on both protein ( Figures 3 B and 3C, pooled results, two independent repeats) and mRNA levels ( Figures S4 B and S4C).
To further delineate the microbiome members involved in SIEC MHC class II induction, we examined SIEC MHC class II expression in 12-week-old C57BL6 male mice treated for 4 weeks with individual components of the AVMN broad-spectrum antibiotics regimen. Importantly, vancomycin treatment, but none of the other three antibiotics, induced a substantial decrease in MHC class II + SIEC frequency ( Figure 3 D, pooled results, three independent repeats), suggesting that gram-positive vancomycin-sensitive bacteria may drive SIEC MHC class II expression at our vivarium. In agreement, mice treated for 4 weeks with metronidazole retained a diurnal pattern of SIEC MHC class II expression at ZT8 versus ZT0, while this pattern was lost upon vancomycin treatment ( Figure 3 E, pooled results, three independent repeats). To further prove that the microbiome directly impacts SIEC MHC class II expression, we transferred microbiomes from either metronidazole or vancomycin-treated mice into 8-week-old C57BL6 GF male mice ( Figures 3 F and 3G, pooled results, three independent repeats) and examined, 2 weeks later, SIEC MHC class II expression in recipient mice. While microbiomes from metronidazole-treated mice successfully induced SPF control levels of SIEC MHC class II expression, microbiomes from vancomycin-treated mice failed to induce such levels of SIEC MHC class II, suggesting that the vancomycin-impacted microbiome is deficient in its SIEC MHC-class-II-inducing capacity for at least 2 weeks after antibiotic exposure.
Having separately linked either the gut microbiome or diet as regulators of SIEC MHC class II expression, we set out to explore whether the observed dietary effect on MHC class II + SIEC frequency acts upstream to the microbiome. To this aim, we transferred microbiomes from either HFD or NC ad libitum fed male mice into 8-week-old C57BL6 GF male mice and examined, 2 weeks later, MHC class II + SIEC frequency ( Figures 3 F and 3H, pooled results, three independent repeats) in recipient mice. While the microbiome from NC-fed mice induced a high SIEC MHC class II expression, the microbiome from HFD-fed donors failed to do so, demonstrating that the effect of HFD on SIEC MHC class II expression is mediated, at least partially, by the microbiome. However, while the HFD microbiome induced low SIEC MHC class II expression, it remained significantly higher than the GF baseline SIEC MHC class II expression level, suggesting that some commensals in the HFD microbiome configuration retain an ability to induce low and temporally stable level SIEC MHC class II expression. Concordantly, “low” SIEC MHC class II expression of 16-week-old C57BL6 HFD-fed male mice could be further inhibited by the AVMN antibiotic regimen ( Figures S4 D and S4E). To further explore whether the observed effect of circadian clock disruption on SIEC MHC class II expression is mediated through dietary impacts on the microbiome, we transferred the microbiome from 12-week-old C57BL6 jet-lagged or control mice into 8-week-old C57BL6 GF male mice ( Figures 3 F and 3I, pooled results, three independent repeats) and examined, 2 weeks later, SIEC MHC class II expression in recipient mice. Indeed, the microbiome from jet-lagged mice failed to induce SIEC MHC class II expression, thereby demonstrating that the effect of circadian clock disruption on SIEC MHC class II population is mediated, at least partially, by the microbiome. Together, these results suggest that the SI microbiome serves as a signaling hub integrating dietary composition and timing inputs and entrains diurnality of MHC class II expression in SIECs.
We next sought to identify which members of the SI microbiome orchestrate diurnal regulation of the MHC class II + SIEC population at our vivarium. To this aim, we examined SI luminal and mucosal microbiome compositions under the conditions featuring low SIEC MHC class II expression, namely, treatment of 12-week-old C57BL6 male mice with vancomycin ( Figures S4 F–S4I), or exposure to HFD ( Figure S4 J). Overall, we identified 6 bacterial taxa ( Lactobacillus , Sutterella , Curtobacterium , Parabacteroides , Desulfovibrio , Aggregatibacter ) to be enriched at the SI mucosa in conditions characterized by low SIEC MHC class II expression (HFD and vancomycin), while 9 bacterial taxa ( Coprococcus , Ruminococcus , Allobaculum , Akkermansia , Candidatus Arthromitus , Streptococcus , Oscillospira , Dorea , Christensenella ) were over-represented when SIEC MHC class II expression was high (NC, metronidazole, Table S1 ). To further pinpoint potential SIEC MHC class II modulators, we treated 8-week-old C57BL6 male mice with either metronidazole, vancomycin, or their combination, to induce a reduction in SIEC MHC class II expression upon vancomycin exposure, followed by a 2-week recovery period in which SIEC MHC class II expression concomitantly returned to control levels ( Figures 4 A and 4B, pooled results, two independent repeats). SI microbiome 16S rDNA composition and SIEC MHC class II protein expression were concomitantly assessed at baseline, after completion of antibiotic intervention, and at the time of reversion of SIEC MHC class II to baseline levels. Cross-correlation analysis identified 3 potential “inducers” ( Candidatus Arthromitus , Lachnospiraceae , Akkermansia ) and 5 potential “suppressors” ( Lactobacillus , Sutterella , Erwinia , Allobaculum , Ruminococcus ) at our vivarium, whose relative abundance positively or negatively correlated with all phases of changes of SIEC MHC class II expression ( Figure 4 C). As this culture-independent search may be susceptible to PCR bias toward more abundant species ( Lau et al., 2016 38. Lau, J.T. ∙ Whelan, F.J. ∙ Herath, I. ... Capturing the diversity of the human gut microbiota through culture-enriched molecular profiling Genome Med. 2016; 8 :72 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ), we complemented it with “culturomics” analysis of SI mucosal microbiome samples from metronidazole- or vancomycin-treated mice ( Figure 4 D) by growing them aerobically or anaerobically on 31 types of media ( Lau et al., 2016 38. Lau, J.T. ∙ Whelan, F.J. ∙ Herath, I. ... Capturing the diversity of the human gut microbiota through culture-enriched molecular profiling Genome Med. 2016; 8 :72 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). 16S rDNA analysis of grown colonies ( Figure 4 D) identified a list of 3 potential “inducers” ( Erwinia , Lachnospiraceae, Akkermansia ) and 7 potential “suppressors” (Lactobacillaceae, Pseudomonas , Streptococcus , Ruminococcus , Allobaculum , Helicobacteraceae, Chromatiaceae) of SIEC MHC class II expression that could be isolated from mice in vivo . Importantly, results of the culturomics approach were mostly consistent with those of the culture-independent approach.
In order to directly test the predicted associations between the SIEC MHC class II and potential “inducers” and “suppressors,” we then mono-colonized 8-week-old C57BL6 GF male mice for 2 weeks with predicted “inducers” and one of the predicted “suppressors” as compared to heat-inactivated strains. Indeed, we demonstrated that live “inducers” such as Akkermansia (AKK), Lachnospiraceae (LH), and segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) induced SIEC MHC class II expression, while the live predicted “suppressor” Lactobacillus Murinus (LBM) as well as heat-inactivated “inducers” failed to do so ( Figures 4 E and 4F; Figure S5 A). As the “inducer” genera Akkermansia , Lachnospiraceae and SFB belong to a group of mucosa-associated bacteria that actively attach to the SIECs as part of their natural behavior, we determined whether attachment to SIECs by an inducer strain is important for the induction of MHC class II expression. Toward this aim, we mono-colonized 8-week-old C57BL6 GF male mice with either mouse SFB (mSFB) or rat SFB (rSFB), with only the former being able to effectively colonize the mouse SI mucosa ( Atarashi et al., 2015 4. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Ando, M. ... Th17 Cell Induction by Adhesion of Microbes to Intestinal Epithelial Cells Cell. 2015; 163 :367-380 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (803) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thaiss et al., 2016 62.

Microbiota Diurnal Rhythmicity Programs Host Transcriptome Oscillations Cell. 2016; 167 :1495-1510 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (565) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, only mSFB was able to induce SIEC MHC class II expression in GF mice, while rSFB failed to do so, indicating that epithelial attachment may be required for the induction of SIEC MHC class II expression by mSFB ( Figures 4 G and 4H, pooled results, three independent repeats). We next sought to determine whether previously described mechanisms downstream of SFB attachment to IECs, namely, CDC42-mediated microbial adhesion triggered endocytosis (MATE) ( Ladinsky et al., 2019 37. Ladinsky, M.S. ∙ Araujo, L.P. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Endocytosis of commensal antigens by intestinal epithelial cells regulates mucosal T cell homeostasis Science. 2019; 363 :eaat4042 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA)-mediated signaling ( Atarashi et al., 2015 4. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Ando, M. ... Th17 Cell Induction by Adhesion of Microbes to Intestinal Epithelial Cells Cell. 2015; 163 :367-380 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (803) PubMed Google Scholar ), modulate SIEC MHC class II expression. Indeed, chemical inhibition of several endocytosis pathways in SIECs ( Figure 4 I) suggested that CDC42-dependent, clathrin-independent, dynamin-dependent endocytosis contributed to regulation of SIEC MHC class II expression. Similarly, the absence of epithelial CDC42 resulted in the loss of diurnal pattern in SIEC MHC class II expression ( Figure 4 J). Moreover, mucosal SI microbiome of Villin-Cre-CDC42 fl/fl mice was depleted of MHC class II inducer bacteria, such as SFB and Akkermansia , akin of other SIEC MHC class II disruptive conditions ( Figure S5 B), while whole body deletion of SAA genes 1, 2, and 3 (SAA triple-knockout mice) was associated with an absence of SIEC MHC class II diurnal activity as compared to co-housed controls ( Figure 4 K). Collectively, these results suggest that rhythmic feeding entrains distinct diurnal SI commensals, which, in turn, induce diurnal fluctuation of SIEC MHC class II through the CDC42 and SAA pathways. Disruption of homeostatic SI microbiome composition by dietary changes (HFD) or antibiotic perturbation leads to depletion of SIEC MHC-class-II-inducing microbial species.
We next aimed to uncover downstream impacts of diet and microbiome-regulated SIEC MHC class II expression on SIEC immunity. To this aim, we generated conditional knockout mice lacking a functional beta chain of the MHC class II complex (I-Ab) ( Hashimoto et al., 2002 29. Hashimoto, K. ∙ Joshi, S.K. ∙ Koni, P.A. A conditional null allele of the major histocompatibility IA-beta chain gene Genesis. 2002; 32 :152-153 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ) specifically in mature enterocytes (Villin-Cre-I-Ab fl /fl , Figures S5 C–S5E) and explored MHC class II contribution to interactions of SIECs with SI intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs), as was previously described in the large intestine ( Biton et al., 2018 7. Biton, M. ∙ Haber, A.L. ∙ Rogel, N. ... T Helper Cell Cytokines Modulate Intestinal Stem Cell Renewal and Differentiation Cell. 2018; 175 :1307-1320 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westendorf et al., 2009 69. Westendorf, A.M. ∙ Fleissner, D. ∙ Groebe, L. ... CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell expansion induced by antigen-driven interaction with intestinal epithelial cells independent of local dendritic cells Gut. 2009; 58 :211-219 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, we found that 8-week old Villin-Cre I-Ab fl /fl mice featured a significant reduction in the frequency of CD4 + T IELs ( Figure 5 A, pooled results, three independent repeats) as compared to littermate controls, suggesting that SIEC MHC class II is required for the SI IEL homeostasis. Furthermore, SIECs in Villin-Cre I-Ab fl /fl Rag1 –/– mice, adoptively transferred with 0.5 × 10 6 OVA-specific (OTII) T cells, failed to induce CD4 + IEL proliferation following systemic introduction of an OVA antigen ( Figure 5 B). In contrast to MHC-class-II-expressing SIECs, “professional” antigen-presenting subpopulations and lamina propria CD4 + lymphocytes remained unaltered in frequency in WT mice upon induction of HFD, a SIEC MHC-class-II-suppressing condition ( Figures S5 F–S5J). The SIEC-IEL MHC-class-II-mediated interaction seems to be unidirectional, as no difference in SIEC MHC class II was observed in CD4 –/– mice comparing to littermate WT controls ( Figure 5 C) as well as in Rag1 –/– mice lacking the adaptive immune arm ( Figure S5 K). In support of the SIEC MHC class II role in modulating homeostasis of the CD4 + IEL population, conditions featuring impaired SIEC MHC class II expression, such as administration of vancomycin, but not ampicillin, neomycin, or metronidazole treatment, were associated with a diminished IEL CD4 + T cell population ( Figure 5 D, pooled results, three independent repeats; Figure 5 G). Similarly, GF mice reconstituted with microbiome from HFD-fed donors failed to increase their IEL CD4 + T cell population compared to NC-microbiome-transferred GF mice ( Figure 5 E, pooled results, three independent repeats; Figure 5 G), while GF mice mono-colonized with mSFB, but not with rSFB, featured an increase in their IEL CD4 + T cell population ( Figures 5 F and 5G, pooled results, three independent repeats). Together, these findings indicate that SIEC MHC class II expression is linked to SI IEL expansion, while genetic or environmentally induced ablation of SIEC MHC class II expression leads to a diminished presence of SI IELs.
As several SI IEL populations, such as CD4 + CD8β – FOXP3 + IL-4 – cells, were previously shown to play an immune-tolerogenic role mediated in part through IL-10 secretion ( Carton et al., 2004 16. Carton, J. ∙ Byrne, B. ∙ Madrigal-Estebas, L. ... CD4+CD8+ human small intestinal T cells are decreased in coeliac patients, with CD8 expression downregulated on intra-epithelial T cells in the active disease Eur. J. Gastroenterol.

Tissue adaptation of regulatory and intraepithelial CD4 + T cells controls gut inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :1581-1586 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next investigated potential effects of SI MHC class II on SI IEL IL-10 protein expression at peak and trough of SI MHC class II expression in either Villin-Cre I-Ab fl /fl mice or littermate controls. In vivo , SI CD4 IEL IL-10 protein expression in WT I-Ab fl /fl littermates was significantly elevated at ZT0 compared to ZT8, while this diurnal shift in IL-10 protein expression was lost in Villin-Cre I-Ab fl /fl mice ( Figure 5 H, pooled results, three independent repeats). These results were corroborated by measurements of CD4 + IEL-derived IL-10 levels every 6 h throughout a 24-h cycle ( Figures S6 A–S6C), in which IEL-derived IL-10 levels featured a diurnal pattern in untreated SPF WT C57BL6 control mice ( Figure S6 B, PT p = 0.0026) but not in broad-spectrum antibiotic (AVMN)-treated mice. Concordantly, environmental disruption of circadian clocks in a model of chronic jet lag negated diurnal fluctuations of SI CD4 + IEL population frequency ( Figures S6 D–S6F). In support of the hypothesis that SIEC MHC class II expression is located downstream to mucosal bacterial attachment, we did not detect statistically significant differences in the mucosal microbiome of 8-week-old, male Villin-Cre I-Ab fl /fl mice versus I-Ab fl /fl littermates ( Figure S6 G). SI CD4 + IEL IL-10 protein expression in Villin-Cre CDC42 fl /fl mice was similar between ZT8 and ZT0 ( Figure 5 I), reflecting a potential role of CDC42 in regulating SIEC diurnal control of downstream mucosal immunity. In contrast, SI CD4 + IEL IL-10 protein expression in SAA TKO mice maintained its differences between ZT8 and ZT0, similar to WT controls ( Figure 5 J). Collectively, these results suggest CDC42 may be required, while SAA1, 2, and 3 are dispensable, for the diurnal production of IL-10 by SI CD4 + IELs.
We next explored the physiological consequences of diurnal SIEC MHC-class-II-induced IL-10 expression on downstream SI function. One of the well-established roles of IEL-derived IL-10 is regulation of gut permeability, also termed barrier function ( Carton et al., 2004 16. Carton, J. ∙ Byrne, B. ∙ Madrigal-Estebas, L. ... CD4+CD8+ human small intestinal T cells are decreased in coeliac patients, with CD8 expression downregulated on intra-epithelial T cells in the active disease Eur. J. Gastroenterol.

An important regulatory role for CD4+CD8 alpha alpha T cells in the intestinal epithelial layer in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :5324-5329 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ; McDonald et al., 2018 44. McDonald, B.D. ∙ Jabri, B. ∙ Bendelac, A. Diverse developmental pathways of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :514-525 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ; Senju et al., 1991 54. Senju, M. ∙ Wu, K.C. ∙ Mahida, Y.R. ...

Sujino, T. ∙ London, M. ∙ Hoytema van Konijnenburg, D.P. ... Tissue adaptation of regulatory and intraepithelial CD4 + T cells controls gut inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :1581-1586 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether this physiologically critical function is diurnally regulated at steady state, we first examined SI ion permeability and trans-epithelial resistance every 4 h throughout two consecutive 24-h cycles ( Figure S6 H) and found both measures of gut barrier function to exhibit diurnal fluctuations ( Figures 6 A and 6B for ion permeability, LS p = 0.0717; PT p = 0.0009; pooled results, two independent repeats; Figures S6 I–S6J for resistance, LS p = 0.0587; PT p = 0.0010). Importantly, the presence of an intact intestinal microbiome was necessary to support this homeostatic diurnal barrier function and was diminished by 4 weeks of broad-spectrum antibiotic (AVMN) treatment ( Figures 6 A and 6B for ion permeability, ABX (AVMN): LS p = 0.9999; PT p = 0.5888; pooled results, two independent repeats; Figures S6 I and S6J for resistance, ABX (AVMN): LS p = 0.9999; PT p = 0.5416). We corroborated these barrier diurnal fluctuations by oral administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-coated 4 kDa dextran beads to mice at different time points across a 24 h period. This enabled generation of a time course quantification of barrier function (reflected by FITC MFI of peripheral blood samples) across the course of a 24 h period. Indeed, results suggested a diurnal pattern of SI permeability ( Figure S6 K, PT p = 0.0035). Similarly, quantification of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) ligand concentrations ( Thaiss et al., 2018 63. Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Levy, M. ∙ Grosheva, I. ... Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection Science. 2018; 359 :1376-1383 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the portal vein ( Figure 6 C), peripheral blood ( Figure S6 L), and the liver ( Figure S6 M) demonstrated a diurnal fluctuation of barrier function. Dietary rhythmicity was a potent regulator of diurnal SI barrier function. Disruption of circadian clocks by both genetic (Per1/2 deficiency) and environmental (chronic jet lag) perturbations led to a significant disruption in SI barrier function, as featured in SI ion permeability, epithelial resistance, FITC-dextran systemic influx and (PRR) ligand concentrations ( Figure 6 D, pooled results, three independent repeats; Figure S6 N; Figure S7 A). These effects were mediated by circadian modulation of feeding rhythmicity, as restoration of periodic feeding rhythmicity in Per1/2 DKO mice by TRF either during the light (day fed, [DF]) or dark phase (night fed [NF]) reversed the altered diurnal pattern of the SI barrier function in these mice ( Figures S7 B and S7C). Similarly, feeding-time restriction could shift the temporal dynamics of SI permeability in WT controls by 12 h ( Figure 6 E, pooled results, independent repeats; Figure S7 D).
Dietary content was also a regulator of the SI barrier function, as HFD feeding of 12-week-old C57BL6 males impaired SI permeability, as featured in SI ion permeability, epithelial resistance, FITC-dextran systemic influx, and PRR ligand concentrations ( Figure 6 F, pooled results, three independent repeats ; Figures S7 E and S7F). Expectedly, TRF of HFD-fed 12-week-old C57BL6 male mice, either during the light or dark phases, had no effect on SI barrier function ( Figures S7 G–S7I). This dietary effect was driven by the HFD-induced altered microbiome, as fecal transplantation of microbiome from HFD-fed donors into GF mice significantly impaired SI permeability, as compared to recipients of microbiome from NC-consuming donors ( Figure 6 G, pooled results, three independent repeats; Figure S7 J). SIEC MHC class II expression downstream of diet composition, feeding rhythms, and the associated SI microbiome likewise was demonstrated to regulate the SI barrier function, as Villin-Cre I-Ab fl /fl mice featured a 3-fold increase in gut permeability and loss of the diurnal pattern, compared to I-Ab fl /fl littermate controls ( Figure 6 H, pooled results, three independent repeats; Figures S7 K and S7L). Systemic supplementation of recombinant IL-10 (rIL-10) to Villin-Cre I-Ab fl /fl mice ( Figure 6 I, pooled results, three independent repeats; Figures S8 A and S8B), to HFD fed mice ( Figure 6 J, pooled results, three independent repeats; Figure S8 C), or to Per1/2 DKO mice and jet-lagged mice ( Figure 6 K, pooled results, three independent repeats; Figure S8 D) significantly improved gut barrier dysfunction in these settings. CDC42-mediated endocytosis potentially participated in regulation of SI barrier function, as PRR ligand concentrations at ZT2 and ZT10 in peripheral blood ( Figure S8 E) and liver ( Figure S8 F) of Villin-Cre CDC42 fl /fl mice were increased as compared to CDC42 fl /fl littermate controls. Collectively, the aforementioned studies suggest that the dietary-microbiome-SIEC MHC class II-IL-10 axis contributes to control of a diurnally variating SI barrier function.
Finally, we explored potential physiological roles of SIEC MHC class II in modulating a murine model of SI CD. To this aim, we utilized a CD4 + T cell transfer-mediated model of IBD that manifests in SI as Crohn-like enteritis by transferring 1.5 ∗ 10 6 naive T cells (CD4 + CD25 – CD44 Low CD62L hi CD45RB hi ) into 8-week-old male Villin-Cre-I-Ab fl /fl -Rag1 –/– mice or into I-Ab fl /fl Rag1 –/– littermate controls ( Figure S8 G). Four weeks later, mice were sacrificed and SI histology, barrier function, and MHC class II expression were assessed. Importantly, recipient Villin-Cre-I-Ab fl /fl -Rag1 –/– mice featured an enhanced weight loss compared to recipient littermate I-Ab fl /fl -Rag1 –/– mice ( Figure 7 A, pooled results, two independent repeats), driven by worsened inflammation by histological score, characterized by transmural inflammation, dense infiltrates involving neutrophils, and crypt abscesses ( Figure 7 B, exemplary histology panels, Figure 7 C, histological quantification, pooled results, two independent repeats). These histopathological changes were coupled with increased SI permeability ( Figure 7 D, pooled results, two independent repeats) and reduced frequency of IL-10 + CD4 + IELs ( Figure 7 E, pooled results, two independent repeats), collectively suggesting that SIEC MHC class II plays a protective role in this SI inflammatory setting.
To further delineate the role of SIEC MHC class II diurnal regulation, we next implemented the chronic jet-lag protocol in the context of T cell transfer-mediated enteritis in I-Ab fl /fl -Rag1 –/– mice. Indeed, jet lag resulted in an accelerated weight loss ( Figure 7 F), reduced SIEC MHC class II expression ( Figure 7 G), increased SI ion permeability ( Figure 7 H), and reduced frequency of IL-10 + CD4 + IELs ( Figure 7 I) in recipient mice, suggesting that temporal regulation of SIEC MHC class II is necessary in regulating SI immune response and barrier function. Supplementation of rIL-10 to Villin-Cre I-Ab fl /fl -Rag1 –/– mice upon induction of adoptive T cell transfer-mediated enteritis ameliorated weight loss ( Figure 7 J), decreased SI ion permeability ( Figure 7 L), but had no effect on SIEC MHC class II expression ( Figure 7 K) or the frequency of IL-10 + CD4 + IELs ( Figure 7 M), supporting the notion that IL-10 activity is downstream of SIEC MHC class II. Collectively, these results suggest that the aforementioned dietary-microbiome-host mucosal immune axis regulates SI immune homeostasis, while its disruption contributes to SI auto-inflammation.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we uncover how feeding composition and rhythmicity modulate the SI barrier function, by shaping the SI microbiome, and regulating SIEC crosstalk with IEL across a 24-h cycle. We highlight diurnally shifting MHC class II expression ( Christ and Blumberg, 1997 18. Christ, A.D. ∙ Blumberg, R.S. The intestinal epithelial cell: immunological aspects Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1997; 18 :449-461 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ) in SIECs to be a signaling conduit, interconnecting extrinsic microbial and dietary cues with diurnal activity of CD4 + CD8a – TCR-αβ + TCR-γδ – IL-10 + IL-4 – Foxp3 – IELs, which, in turn, diurnally secrete IL-10 ( Das et al., 2003 21. Das, G. ∙ Augustine, M.M. ∙ Das, J. ... An important regulatory role for CD4+CD8 alpha alpha T cells in the intestinal epithelial layer in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :5324-5329 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sujino et al., 2016 58. Sujino, T. ∙ London, M. ∙ Hoytema van Konijnenburg, D.P. ... Tissue adaptation of regulatory and intraepithelial CD4 + T cells controls gut inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :1581-1586 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), ultimately driving a higher SI permeability and tissue tolerance during the active phase and a lower permeability and tissue tolerance during the resting phase (summary schematic available at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wp2wt38pdg/draft?a+1bb5fe57-453f-4b05-b558-43207bb705b8a ) . Disruption of this diurnally regulated diet-microbiome-SIEC MHC class II-IL-10 axis by host circadian clock disruption, dietary alterations, or epithelial-specific MHC class II depletion leads to commensal-dependent impairment of the SI barrier function and extensive microbial product influx, contributing to exacerbated Crohn-like enteritis. This axis, to be further explored in future studies, may present a mechanistic explanation for the observed reduction of IELs noted in patients with Celiac disease ( Carton et al., 2004 16. Carton, J. ∙ Byrne, B. ∙ Madrigal-Estebas, L. ... CD4+CD8+ human small intestinal T cells are decreased in coeliac patients, with CD8 expression downregulated on intra-epithelial T cells in the active disease Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2004; 16 :961-968 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) and supports the IEL tolerogenic role observed in experimental models of IBD ( McDonald et al., 2018 44. McDonald, B.D. ∙ Jabri, B. ∙ Bendelac, A. Diverse developmental pathways of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :514-525 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Additionally, our study identifies the SI microbiome as a central module responding to nutritional inputs, such as feeding composition and rhythmicity, by altering its composition, to enable relay of environmental signals to host SIECs across a 24-h cycle. Through this activity, one may speculate that the dynamically shifting SI microbiome enables the host to anticipate incoming nutrient availability, accordingly adapt its SI absorptive machinery, and synchronize the tolerogenic activity of intra-epithelial first line immune responders to an anticipated increase in antigenic burden. We envision a diurnal SIEC reactivity to nutritional and microbiome signals as potentially constituting an important organizational principle of host-microbiome meta-organismal cooperation, jointly orchestrating the SI barrier function and associated mucosal immunity. Disruption of any of the components of this metaorganismal SI host-microbiome axis can deleteriously impact SI barrier integrity. Such disruption, in turn, may contribute to an exacerbated SI inflammation culminating in Crohn-like enteritis in susceptible hosts.
Future animal and human studies may delineate the relevance of the principles highlighted by our study to increased risk of CD exacerbation upon disruption of the sleep-wake cycle ( Liu et al., 2017 42.

Such mechanistic insights may help delineate new person-specific dietary, microbiome, and SIEC-targeted interventions, aimed at utilizing checkpoints along this axis toward restoring barrier function and tissue tolerance in SI auto-inflammatory disorders.
Our study focused on exploring the effects of nutrition and the microbiome on SIEC interactions with IEL, which may impact downstream barrier function and inflammatory capacity in both direct and indirect manners. Other IEC-immune interactions may indirectly affect downstream barrier function and inflammation and merit further studies. Additionally, a residual 40% SIEC MHC class II expression noted upon exposure to HFD ( Figure 3 B) may point to the presence of SIEC subsets that feature a stable, rather than diurnally shifting MHC class II expression pattern and merit further studies. Likewise, the intricate details of molecular machinery regulating SIEC MHC class II expression and its interplay with microbial adhesion events constitute promising avenues of future research.

C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Envigo and allowed to acclimatize to the animal facility environment for 2 weeks before used for experimentation. Germ-free C57BL/6 and Swiss Webster mice were born in the Weizmann Institute germ-free facility and routinely monitored for sterility. Villin-Cre (B6.Cg-Tg(Vil1-cre)1000Gum/J), OTII (OT-IIB6.CgTg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J), CD4 KO (Cd4 tm1Mak ) and Rag1 –/– (B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom/J) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. I-Ab fl/fl on a C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by Steffen Jung (Weizmann Institute) and Pandelakis A. Koni (Augusta University). Per1/2 DKO mice on a C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by Gad Asher (Weizmann Institute). SAA (1,2,3) triple knockout mice were kindly provided by Kenya Honda (Keio University). Villin-Cre CDC42 fl /fl mice were kindly provided by Nan Gao (Rutgers University). In all experiments, age- and gender-matched mice were used. Mice were 8-12 weeks of age at the beginning of experiments. All mice were kept at a strict 24-hour light-dark cycle, with lights being turned on from 6am to 6pm. For circadian experiments circadian cabinets (ActiMetrics) and software: ClockLab Analysis 6 (ActiMetrics); ClockLab Data Collection (ActiMetrics); ClockLab Chamber Control (ActiMetrics) were used to facilitate around the clock sample collection throughout two consecutive 24-hour cycles. In timed feeding experiments, food access was limited to the dark phase or light phase where indicated. Prior to any interventions, mice were randomized to ensure that no incidental pre-intervention differences in body weight existed between the different groups. Mice were exposed to high-fat diet for 4 weeks (Research Diets D12492) or normal chow diet (Envigo, Teklad 2018) as indicated. For antibiotic treatment, mice were given a combination of vancomycin (0.5 g/l), ampicillin (1 g/l), kanamycin (1 g/l), and metronidazole (1 g/l) in their drinking water for four weeks as previously described ( Levy et al., 2015 41. Levy, M. ∙ Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Zeevi, D. ... Microbiota-Modulated Metabolites Shape the Intestinal Microenvironment by Regulating NLRP6 Inflammasome Signaling Cell. 2015; 163 :1428-1443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). All antibiotics were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. All experimental procedures were approved by the Weizmann Institute of Science IACUC.
Frozen SI luminal and mucosal microbiome samples were processed for DNA isolation using the DNeasy PowerLyzer PowerSoil kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the 16S rDNA gene PCR amplification, 1 ng of the purified fecal DNA was used for PCR amplification. Amplicons spanning the variable region V4 of the 16S rDNA gene were generated by using the following primers:Fwd 515F- AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTATGGTAATTGTGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA, Rev 806R-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATXXXXXXXXXXXXAGTCAGTCAGCCGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT, where X represents a barcode base. The reactions were subsequently pooled and cleaned (PCR clean kit, Invitrogen), and the PCR products were then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with 500 bp paired-end reads. Overlapping paired-end FASTQ files of 16S amplicon sequencing data were matched and analyzed using the Qiime2 pipeline (q2cli version 2019.7.0) ( Bolyen et al., 2019 8. Bolyen, E. ∙ Rideout, J.R. ∙ Dillon, M.R. ... Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2 Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :852-857 Crossref Scopus (11052) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data were demultiplexed according to sample-specific barcodes, poor quality bases were trimmed, sequences were denoised and binned to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using the dada2 plugin for Qiime2 ( Callahan et al., 2016 13. Callahan, B.J. ∙ McMurdie, P.J. ∙ Rosen, M.J. ... DADA2: High-resolution sample inference from Illumina amplicon data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :581-583 Crossref Scopus (17029) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequences were aligned using Mafft, masked and a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with fasttree. Taxonomic assignment was performed using naive Bayes feature classifier and Greengenes 13_8 database. Community ecology analyses were carried out in R (v3.5.0). Data normalization was carried out by subsampling to the lowest sequencing depth in the respective experiment using the vegan package (v2.5-6, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html ) function rrarefy. Weighted UniFrac distances for ordination and clustering were calculated using the GUniFrac R package (v1.1, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GUniFrac/index.html ). Hierarchical clustering was performed using hclust function and Ward’s minimum variance method. Differential abundance testing of individual bacterial genera was carried out with Mann-Whitney U test using the wilcox.test function, and log2 fold changes were calculated.
Library preparation of sorted SIEC was performed based on a previously published protocol ( Bagnoli et al., 2018 6. Bagnoli, J.W. ∙ Ziegenhain, C. ∙ Janjic, A. ... Sensitive and powerful single-cell RNA sequencing using mcSCRB-seq Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2937 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Specifically, 10,000 cells were collected and were resuspended in 20ul RLT buffer (QIAGEN, 79216) supplement with 40mM DTT. The cells solution was cleaned with 2X AM pure beads (Beckman Coulter) and reverse transcription was directly done on the cells with the beads using 20 u/μl Maxima H reverse transcriptase (Thermo, EP0753), 1mM dNTPS (Thermo R0182), 7.5% PEG 8000 (Sigma), 2 μM TSO E5V6NEXT (IDT) and 1 μL of 4nM barcoded RT primer for each reaction. The reaction was incubated at 42°C for 90 minutes inactivated at 80°C for 10 minutes. Finally, 1 μL of the reaction was diluted 1:20 with Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and measured by real-time PCR using GAPDH primers as a house keeping gene to determine the Ct values of each sample. Samples with similar Ct values were pooled together, cleaned with 1X AM pure beads (Beckman Coulter) and eluted with 17 μL Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). The samples were then incubated with 1 μL of exonuclease I (20 u/μl) and 2 μL exonuclease buffer (Thermo, EN0582) and incubated 20 minutes at 37°C followed by 10 minutes at 80°C. cDNA amplification was performed by adding 1 μL of Terra polymerase (1.25u/μl) and 25 μL of Terra direct 2x buffer (Clontech, 639270), 1 μL of SINGV6 primer (10 μM, IDT) and 3 μL nuclease free water (Sigma, W4502). The PCR was done by 3 min 98°C, followed by 13-15 PCR cycles (for 0.5-3 ng/μl cDNA after amplification) of 15 s 98°C, 30 s 65°C, 68°C 4 min. Final elongation was performed for 5 minutes, 72°C. The cDNA products were cleaned using 0.8X AM pure beads (Beckman Coulter) and eluted with 10 μL Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). cDNA (0.8-2 ng/μl) was further used to construct Nextera XT DNA libraries (Illumina, FC-131-1024) following manufacturer’s instructions and 3′ ends were enriched with a custom P5 primer (P5NEXTPT5, IDT) and amplified with i7 index primers from Nextera XT Index Kit v2 (Illumina, FC-131-1002). Finally, the amplified libraries were cleaned using 0.6X AM pure beads (Beckman Coulter) and eluted with 20 μL of Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). The quality control of the resulting libraries was performed with an Agilent High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape System (Agilent, 5067- 5584). Libraries that passed quality control were loaded with a concentration of 2 pM on 75 cycle high output flow cells (Illumina, FC-404-2005) and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) with the following cycle distribution: 8bp index 1, no index 2, 16bp read 1, 66bp read 2.
Raw files were converted to fastq files using the bcl2fatq package (Illumina). i7 barcodes were then used for pool demultiplexing. zUMIs package ( https://doi.org/10.1101/153940 ) was used for samples demultiplexing, STAR alignment to the mouse genome (GRCm38.84), and unique UMI counting. For each comparison, genes with #reads ≥ 10e-4 of total reads, expressed in at least 1/5 of one group in each comparison were included for the analysis.
DE genes were found using DESeq2 models fitted separately for each comparison ( Figure 1 A; Figures S1 B–S1D, Figure S2 A). Normalized gene expression values ( Figures S1 B–S1D; Figure S2 A) were calculated using the regularized log transformation (rlog). Gene assignment to GO terms was done in the following manner: For each gene, -log(padj) sign(log2FoldChange) scores were calculated. Then the bulk.gsea function (liger package http://ge-lab.org/gskb/2-MousePath/MousePath_GO_gmt.gmt ) was used as the universe model.
Collected murine tissues were flushed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 3 hours and subsequently agitated in 30% sucrose, 4% PFA in PBS overnight at 4°C. Fixed tissues were embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek), 8 μm sections were used for smFISH staining. Probe libraries ( Tables S2 and S3 ) were designed using the Stellaris FISH Probe Designer (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Petaluma, CA). The intestinal sections were hybridized with smFISH probe sets according to a previously published protocol. Dapi (Sigma-Aldrich, D9542) and a FITC-conjugated antibody against E-Cadherin (BD Biosciences, 612131) were utilized as nuclear and cell-membrane counterstains, respectively. SmFISH imaging was performed on a Nikon-Ti-E inverted fluorescence microscope with a 100 × oil-immersion objective and a Photometrics Pixis 1024 CCD camera using MetaMorph software as previously reported . The epithelial cell fragments were manually segmented based on nuclear and cell-membrane counterstains and mRNA density (number of mRNA per unit cell segment volume) was computed using custom MATLAB program ( 28 , MATLAB Release 2016a, The MathWorks Inc., USA). We used FIJI software to extract the intensity profiles along manually marked lines spanning the basal to apical cell axis. A previously reported FIJI script was used to extract the intensity profiles along these lines for each channel and for each stack using the getProfile command. Using MATLAB, we identified the basal and apical parts of the line segments according to the line intensity profile of the DAPI channel, where the proximal and distal line segments that were below 0.7 of the maximum were defined as basal and apical sides respectively. We next removed background intensity, defined as the lower percentile of the line profiles and computed the ratio between the maximal intensities in the apical and basal sides.
Images of tissue sections were taken with a confocal microscope Fluorview FV1200 using Kalman and sequential laser emission to reduce noise and signal overlap. Scale bars were added to each image using the confocal software FV10-ASW 3.1 Viewer. Images were analyzed and visualized using ImageJ software ( Schneider et al., 2012 53. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (43944) PubMed Google Scholar ).
SI samples were extensively washed from the luminal content and opened longitudinally. The tissue was then cut into pieces of 1cm length and incubated in HBSS containing 2mM EDTA and 1mM DTT at 37°C for 15 minutes while shaking at 180 rpm. Epithelial cells were collected, filtered, centrifuged, and subsequently stained with the Zombie-UV viability dye at room temperature protected from light for 15 minutes, followed by a wash with PBS containing 1% BSA (FACS buffer), FC-receptors blocking and surface markers staining on ice for 30 minutes. Following the separation from epithelium, the lamina propria samples were digested using DNAase I and Collagenase II (Sigma). The isolated cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer for direct cell surface staining. Intracellular staining with antibodies against transcription factor targets was performed on cells fixed using Foxp3 Intracellular Staining Kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, while intracellular staining with antibodies against cytokines was performed on in vitro re-stimulated cells using Cell Activation Cocktail with Brefeldin A (Biolegend) and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature protected from light. Multiparameter analysis was performed on a LSR II or LSR Fortessa (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Transepithelial resistance was measured a modular Ussing chamber system (Warner Instruments, P2300) according to the manufacturer’s instructions as in Thaiss et al. (2018) 63. Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Levy, M. ∙ Grosheva, I. ... Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection Science. 2018; 359 :1376-1383 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar . In brief, EasyMount chambers were calibrated, SI tissue was excised from mice and immediately mounted, and voltage clamp measurements were performed. Tissues were maintained at 37°C in physiological salt solution throughout the duration of the recordings.
On the day of the assay, 4 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a concentration of 40 mg/ml. Mice were fasted for 4 hours prior to gavage with 200 μL of dextran. Mice were anesthetized and 3 hours following gavage peripheral blood was collected, excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm.
The following PRR reporter cell lines were obtained from InvivoGen (HEK-Blue TLR and NLR Reporter cell lines): TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR9, NOD1, NOD2. Extracts from liver, portal vein serum and peripheral blood serum were homogenized and added to reporter cell lines incubated with HEK-Blue detection medium (InvivoGen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions as in Thaiss et al. (2018) 63. Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Levy, M. ∙ Grosheva, I. ... Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection Science. 2018; 359 :1376-1383 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar .
Intestinal tissue was excised from mice, thoroughly rinsed with ice-cold PBS to clean the tissue from luminal content and opened longitudinally. The tissue was then cut into pieces of 1cm length and incubated in HBSS containing 2mM EDTA and 1mM DTT at 37°C for 15 minutes while shaking at 180 rpm. Epithelial cells were collected, filtered, centrifuged, and subsequently stained with the Zombie-UV viability dye at room temperature protected from light for 15 minutes, followed by a wash with FACS buffer, FcR blocking and anti-EpCAM, anti-CD45 staining on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed, resuspended, filtered and sorted into lysis/binding buffer (Life Technologies) using a FACS-Fusion cell sorter (BD).
Perfusion of extra-intestinal loops was done as previously described ( Ladinsky et al., 2019 37. Ladinsky, M.S. ∙ Araujo, L.P. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Endocytosis of commensal antigens by intestinal epithelial cells regulates mucosal T cell homeostasis Science. 2019; 363 :eaat4042 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized using ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). A 6 cm portion of the distal jejunum was exteriorized and the contents flushed. The externalized portion was perfused with the inhibitors for 30 min using a syringe pump. Animals were perfused with 20 mM Pitstop 2 (SIGMA SML1169), 10 mM CASIN (SIGMA SML 1253), 50 uM Dynasore (SIGMA D7693), or buffer. Mice were anesthetized throughout the experiment and kept warm by heating pads linked to thermoregulators (Harvard Apparatus Homeothermic Monitoring System Model 55-7020) that sense and maintain body temperature. After perfusion, the perfused section, were collected and processed for FACS.
Fresh anaerobic mucosal distal jejunum samples from metronidazole- and vancomycin- treated mice ( Figure 1 C) were cultured anaerobically and aerobically using 31 media ( Table S4 ) for culture-enriched molecular profiling as described previously ( Lau et al., 2016 38. Lau, J.T. ∙ Whelan, F.J. ∙ Herath, I. ... Capturing the diversity of the human gut microbiota through culture-enriched molecular profiling Genome Med. 2016; 8 :72 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cultivable portion of the mucosal microbiota was determined by comparing the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) recovered by 16S sequencing of the culture plates to OTUs from culture-independent sequencing of the microbiome sample.
All FMT procedures were carried out as fast as possible to avoid prolonged exposure to oxygen. All collections were carried out within a laminar flow hood. Microbiome sample collection: Microbiome samples were collected in 2ml tubes (Eppendorf) containing sterile 20% glycerol. Following sample transfer into glycerol solution, the microbiome matter was homogenized. After homogenization the samples were immediately placed on dry ice prior to long-term storage at –80°C. Microbiome transfer: Following thawing, 0.1g of fecal sample was mixed in 1 mL sterile PBS, filtered and immediately placed in a Gaspak EZ Anaerobe System (BD) prior to oral gavage with 200 μL of a diluted microbiome sample per mouse.
Spleen T effector cells (CD4 + CD25 – CD45RB HI ) were sorted and 0.3ml of the cell suspension was injected i.p. at the concentration 5 ∗ 10 6 cells/ml into Villin-Cre MHCII fl /fl Rag1 –/– versus MHCII fl /fl Rag1 –/– littermate mice, as described previously ( Powrie et al., 1994 49. Powrie, F. ∙ Leach, M.W. ∙ Mauze, S. ... Inhibition of Th1 responses prevents inflammatory bowel disease in scid mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi CD4+ T cells Immunity. 1994; 1 :553-562 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1028) PubMed Google Scholar ), to trigger pan enteritis ( Eri et al., 2012 22. Eri, R. ∙ McGuckin, M.A. ∙ Wadley, R. T cell transfer model of colitis: a great tool to assess the contribution of T cells in chronic intestinal inflammation Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 844 :261-275 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Weight measurements were conducted twice weekly. Three weeks post T cell transfer intestinal permeability was assessed using FITC-dextran. In the IL-10 rescue experiment mice were intraperitoneally injected with 4 μg of recombinant IL-10 (Sigma) in 100 μL of PBS or with vehicle alone ( Flannigan et al., 2014 24. Flannigan, K.L. ∙ Agbor, T.A. ∙ Blackler, R.W. ... Impaired hydrogen sulfide synthesis and IL-10 signaling underlie hyperhomocysteinemia-associated exacerbation of colitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :13559-13564 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kunisawa et al., 2013 36. Kunisawa, J. ∙ Gohda, M. ∙ Hashimoto, E. ... Microbe-dependent CD11b+ IgA+ plasma cells mediate robust early-phase intestinal IgA responses in mice Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :1772 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Injections were performed every three days starting from day 21 on days 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36 post adoptive transfer. Mice were euthanized four weeks post T cell transfer and histological, Ussing chamber measurements and FACS analysis of the ileum and distal jejunum were performed.
Intraperitoneal injections of 4 μg of recombinant IL-10 (Sigma) in 100 μL of PBS or with vehicle alone ( Flannigan et al., 2014 24. Flannigan, K.L. ∙ Agbor, T.A. ∙ Blackler, R.W. ... Impaired hydrogen sulfide synthesis and IL-10 signaling underlie hyperhomocysteinemia-associated exacerbation of colitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :13559-13564 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kunisawa et al., 2013 36. Kunisawa, J. ∙ Gohda, M. ∙ Hashimoto, E. ... Microbe-dependent CD11b+ IgA+ plasma cells mediate robust early-phase intestinal IgA responses in mice Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :1772 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) were carried out twice weekly for two weeks prior to mice euthanization, Ussing chamber measurements and FACS analysis of the ileum and distal jejunum. Measurements of FITC-dextran concentration in peripheral blood samples were done 3 days prior to mice euthanization.
Ileum sections were fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for staining with H&E. Subsequently, sections were examined by a blinded veterinary pathologist and scored for transmural inflammation, dense infiltrates involving neutrophils, and crypt abscessation on a scale from 0 (healthy) to 4 (most severe).
Figure and supplementary figure panels were checked for data integrity using the Proofig pipeline.
Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Comparisons made between two groups were performed using Mann-Whitney U-test. ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test were used for comparisons between multiple groups. Cycling behavior was assessed using the Meta_cycle package ( Wu et al., 2016 70. Wu, G. ∙ Anafi, R.C. ∙ Hughes, M.E. ... MetaCycle: an integrated R package to evaluate periodicity in large scale data Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :3351-3353 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ), with oscillations tested for a 24-hour period length. For experiments shorter than 30 hours, we evaluated the significance of the periodic trend using 100 cross validations (CV), in which the data was split to train (70%) and test (30%) groups, a periodic model 𝐴 ⁢ s i n ⁡ ( 𝑇 + 𝐶 ) was trained on the training dataset (where 𝑇 represents the time variable, and parameters 𝐴 and 𝐶 are learned by minimizing the L2 norm of the objective from the ground truth). For the test dataset, we set 𝑇 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑠 as the mean square error (MSE) from the fitted model, then for 1000 permutations we set 𝑇 𝑖 to hold the MSE of the shuffled testing group from the fitted model. For each CV round, we set 𝑝 𝑗 ← # { 𝑖 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ 𝑡 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 𝑇 𝑖 ≤ 𝑇 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑠 } / 1 0 0 1 and report the mean 𝑝 𝑗 across all CV rounds. To test for rhythmicity in experiments longer than 30 hours, for pulled experiments we used the Lomb-Scargle (LS) method ( Glynn et al., 2006 26. Glynn, E.F. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Mushegian, A.R. Detecting periodic patterns in unevenly spaced gene expression time series using Lomb-Scargle periodograms Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :310-316 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lomb, 1976 43. Lomb, N.R. Least-squares frequency analysis of unequally spaced data Astrophys. Space Sci. 1976; 39 :447-462 Crossref Scopus (4353) Google Scholar ), and for individual repetitions we used JTK_CYCLE ( Hughes et al., 2010 32. Hughes, M.E. ∙ Hogenesch, J.B. ∙ Kornacker, K. JTK_CYCLE: an efficient nonparametric algorithm for detecting rhythmic components in genome-scale data sets J. Biol. Rhythms. 2010; 25 :372-380 Crossref Scopus (742) PubMed Google Scholar ), both implemented in MetaCycle package. The data was averaged per time point. Linear regression was used to assess correlations between two datasets. Unless stated otherwise, elements with p < 0.05 and q < 0.1 were considered significant. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001
