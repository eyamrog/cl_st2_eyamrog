Title: Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike


Abstract: Summary

Soon after the emergence and global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage BA.1, another Omicron lineage, BA.2, began outcompeting BA.1. The results of statistical analysis showed that the effective reproduction number of BA.2 is 1.4-fold higher than that of BA.1. Neutralization experiments revealed that immunity induced by COVID vaccines widely administered to human populations is not effective against BA.2, similar to BA.1, and that the antigenicity of BA.2 is notably different from that of BA.1. Cell culture experiments showed that the BA.2 spike confers higher replication efficacy in human nasal epithelial cells and is more efficient in mediating syncytia formation than the BA.1 spike. Furthermore, infection experiments using hamsters indicated that the BA.2 spike-bearing virus is more pathogenic than the BA.1 spike-bearing virus. Altogether, the results of our multiscale investigations suggest that the risk of BA.2 to global health is potentially higher than that of BA.1.

Section: Introduction

The virological characteristics of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as their transmissibility, pathogenicity, and resistance to vaccine-induced immunity and antiviral drugs, represent an urgent global health concern. In March 2022, the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 and BA lineages) is the most recently recognized variant of concern, and it has spread worldwide ( WHO, 2022 58. WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (February 3, 2022) 2022 https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/ Google Scholar ). Omicron was first reported in South Africa at the end of November 2021 ( WHO, 2021 57. WHO Classification of Omicron (B.1.1.529): SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (November 26, 2021) 2021 https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern Google Scholar ). Soon after its emergence, a variant of Omicron, the BA.1 lineage, rapidly spread worldwide and outcompeted other variants, such as Delta. Since then, another variant of Omicron, the BA.2 lineage, was detected (March 2022) in multiple countries, such as Denmark and the UK ( UKHSA, 2022 51. UKHSA SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England Tech. Briefing. 2022; 35 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1050999/Technical-Briefing-35-28January2022.pdf Google Scholar ). Notably, BA.2 has begun outcompeting BA.1 ( UKHSA, 2022 51. UKHSA SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England Tech. Briefing. 2022; 35 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1050999/Technical-Briefing-35-28January2022.pdf Google Scholar ), suggesting that BA.2 is more transmissible than BA.1.
The virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as the antigenicity and infection route into the cells, are determined by the spike (S) protein. The precursor of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is initially cleaved in infected cells by a cellular protease, furin, yielding two subunits, S1 and S2 (reviewed in V'Kovski et al., 2021 55. V'Kovski, P. ∙ Kratzel, A. ∙ Steiner, S. ... Coronavirus biology and replication: implications for SARS-CoV-2 Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2021; 19 :155-170 Crossref Scopus (1864) PubMed Google Scholar ). The S1 subunit binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes this molecule as the receptor for cell entry ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 17. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor Cell. 2020; 181 :271-280.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13999) PubMed Google Scholar ). After binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 invades the cells via transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)-dependent or -independent pathways. In the former pathway, the S2 subunit is processed by another cellular protease, TMPRSS2, which is expressed on the cell surface, and the viral particle then fuses with the plasma membrane. In the latter pathway, the viral particle bound to ACE2 is endocytosed independently of TMPRSS2, and then the S2 subunit on the viral particle is processed by the cellular proteases expressed in endosomes (e.g., cathepsin), leading to viral fusion [reviewed in ( V'Kovski et al., 2021 55. V'Kovski, P. ∙ Kratzel, A. ∙ Steiner, S. ... Coronavirus biology and replication: implications for SARS-CoV-2 Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2021; 19 :155-170 Crossref Scopus (1864) PubMed Google Scholar )]. Since the BA.2 S protein bears >30 mutations compared with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain (B lineage, strain Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank: NC_045512.2 ) ( Wu et al., 2020 60. Wu, F. ∙ Zhao, S. ∙ Yu, B. ... A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China Nature. 2020; 579 :265-269 Crossref Scopus (7932) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is feasible to assume that the virological features of BA.2 are dramatically different from those of the original virus as well as the other variants.

Additionally, the S protein of BA.1 is less efficiently cleaved by furin and less fusogenic than those of the Delta variant and an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variant belonging to the B.1.1 lineage ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ...

However, the virological characteristics of BA.2 remain poorly understood.

Section: Results

Omicron has been classified into three main lineages: BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. As a sublineage of BA.1, BA1.1 harbors an R346K substitution in its S protein ( Figure 1 A). Although these lineages are monophyletic, their sequences have greatly diversified. For example, BA.1 differs from BA.2 by 50 amino acids, which is approximately twice the number found among four other variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) and Wuhan-Hu-1, a prototypical SARS-CoV-2 isolate ( Figure 1 B). Phylodynamic analysis has suggested that BA.1 emerged first, followed by BA.2 and BA.3 ( Figure S1 ). In addition to BA.1, the earlier strains of BA.2, BA.3, and BA.1.1 were isolated in Gauteng Province, South Africa, the site of the earliest Omicron (BA.1) epidemic ( Figure S1 ) ( Viana et al., 2022 54. Viana, R. ∙ Moyo, S. ∙ Amoako, D.G. ... Rapid epidemic expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in southern Africa Nature. 2022; 603 :679-686 Crossref Scopus (1014) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results suggest that the remarkable diversification of Omicron probably occurred around Gauteng Province and that all Omicron lineages emerged there.
Although BA.1 spread worldwide earlier than BA.2, since January 2022, the lineage frequency of BA.2 has increased and exceeded that of BA.1 in multiple countries, such as the Philippines, India, Denmark, Singapore, Austria, and South Africa ( Figures 1 C and S2 ). To quantify the growth advantage of BA.2 in the population, we constructed a Bayesian hierarchical model representing the epidemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineages. This hierarchical model can estimate the global average value of the relative effective reproduction number of each viral lineage ( Figure 1 D) as well as the number in each country ( Figure S2 ). The effective reproduction number of BA.2 is 1.40-fold higher than that of BA.1 on average worldwide [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.27–1.56; Figure 1 D]. Furthermore, the effective reproduction number of BA.2 is even higher than that of BA.1.1 ( Figures 1 D and S2 D). These results suggest that the BA.2 epidemic will further expand around the world, highlighting the importance of elucidating the virological features of BA.2 in depth.
Since the sequence of BA.2 (particularly that of the S protein) is substantially different from that of BA.1 ( Figures 1 B and 2 A), it is reasonable to assume that the virological properties of BA.2, such as its immune resistance and pathogenicity, are also different. To elucidate the virological features of BA.2, we set out to perform a neutralization assay using pseudoviruses and the neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination.

An infectious SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 Omicron virus escapes neutralization by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies Nat. Med. 2022; 28 :490-495 Crossref Scopus (470) PubMed Google Scholar ), BA.1 was found to be highly resistant to the antisera elicited by the mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, and BNT162b2 vaccines ( Figures 2 B–2D). Similar to BA.1, BA.2 was also highly resistant to vaccine-induced antisera ( Figures 2 B–2D). On the other hand, the sera obtained 1 month after the 3rd dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine showed that both of BA.1 and BA.2 could be neutralized, but the neutralization levels were still lower than those of B.1.1 and Delta ( Figure 2 D). Additionally, BA.2 was almost completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, and was 35-fold more resistant to another therapeutic antibody, sotrovimab, than the ancestral D614G-bearing B.1.1 virus ( Figure 2 E). Moreover, both BA.1 and BA.2 were highly resistant to convalescent sera from individuals who had been infected with an early pandemic virus (collected before May 2020) and the Alpha and Delta variants ( Figure 2 F). These data suggest that similar to BA.1, BA.2 is highly resistant to antisera induced by vaccination or infection with other SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as three antiviral therapeutic antibodies.
We next tested the 21 sera infected with BA.1 from 13 convalescents who were fully vaccinated (2 shots), 1 convalescent who was 1-dose vaccinated, and 7 convalescents who were not vaccinated ( Table S2 ). BA.1 convalescent sera exhibited the strongest antiviral effect against BA.1 ( Figure 2 F). Regarding the case of the BA.1-infected sera with full vaccination, the antiviral effects against BA.1 and BA.2 were comparable ( Figure 2 F). On the other hand, it is interesting to note that compared with the BA.1 variant, the BA.2 variant was significantly (4.1-fold) more resistant to the BA.1-infected sera from convalescents without full vaccination ( Figure 2 F; p = 0.016 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test), suggesting that the BA.1 infection without vaccination cannot elicit efficient antiviral humoral immunity against BA.2. Importantly, the sera from fully vaccinated BA.1-infected convalescents exhibited significantly stronger antiviral effects against all variants tested than those from unvaccinated or 1-dose vaccinated convalescents ( Figure 2 G), suggesting that BA.1 infection without vaccination cannot elicit efficient antiviral humoral immunity.
To further address the possibility that BA.1-induced humoral immunity is less effective against BA.2, we used convalescent sera obtained from infected hamsters at 16 days postinfection (d.p.i.). Similar to the results of experiments involving convalescent human sera ( Figure 2 F), both BA.1 and BA.2 exhibited pronounced resistance against B.1.1- and Delta-infected convalescent hamster sera ( Figure 2 H). More importantly, BA.2 was significantly (2.9-fold) more resistant to BA.1-infected convalescent hamster sera than BA.1 ( Figure 2 H; p = 0.031 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test), which is consistent with the observation using human sera ( Figure 2 F). Moreover, mice were immunized with cells expressing the S proteins of ancestral B.1.1, BA.1, and BA.2 viruses, and murine antisera were collected. Again, the neutralization assay using murine sera showed that compared with BA.1, BA.2 is more significantly (6.4-fold) resistant to BA.1 S-immunized sera ( Figure 2 I; p = 0.012 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Again, these findings suggest that BA.1-induced humoral immunity is less effective against BA.2. In contrast to the resistance of BA.2 to BA.1-induced humoral immunity ( Figures 2 F, 2H, and 2I), the sensitivity of BA.1 to BA.2-induced humoral immunity in rodents was comparable with that of BA.2 ( Figures 2 H and 2I). These data suggest that BA.2-induced immunity is cross-reactive with BA.1.
To investigate the virological characteristics of BA.2, we generated chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 that expresses GFP and harbors the S gene of ancestral B.1.1, Delta, BA.1, or BA.2 by reverse genetics (rB.1.1 S-GFP, rDelta S-GFP, rBA.1 S-GFP, and rBA.2-GFP, respectively, summarized in Figure 3 A) ( Torii et al., 2021 50. Torii, S. ∙ Ono, C. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Establishment of a reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV-2 using circular polymerase extension reaction Cell Rep. 2021; 35 :109014 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the growth of rBA.1 S-GFP and rBA.2 S-GFP in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells was comparable, rBA.2 S-GFP was more replicative than rBA.1 S-GFP in Calu-3 cells and primary human nasal epithelial cells ( Figure 3 B). Notably, the morphology of the infected cells differed; rBA.2 S-GFP formed significantly (1.52-fold) larger syncytia than rBA.1 S-GFP ( Figures 3 C and S3 A). However, the plaque size of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells infected with rBA.1 S-GFP and rBA.2 S-GFP was significantly smaller than that of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells infected with rB.1.1 S-GFP, and the plaques that formed following rBA.2 S-GFP infection were significantly (1.27-fold) larger than those that formed following rBA.1 S-GFP infection ( Figure 3 D). Moreover, coculture of S-expressing cells with HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells showed that BA.2 S induced the formation of significantly (2.9-fold) larger multinuclear syncytia than BA.1 S ( Figure S3 B). These data suggest that BA.2 is more fusogenic than BA.1. To further explore this possibility, we analyzed the efficiency in mediating syncytia formation of BA.2 S ( Motozono et al., 2021 33. Motozono, C. ∙ Toyoda, M. ∙ Zahradnik, J. ... SARS-CoV-2 spike L452R variant evades cellular immunity and increases infectivity Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 29 :1124-1136.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). The expression level of BA.2 S on the cell surface was significantly lower than that of BA.1 S ( Figure 3 E). Nevertheless, our fusion assays using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells and Calu-3 cells showed that BA.2 S is significantly more efficient in mediating syncytia formation than BA.1 S ( Figure 3 F).
Because we have proposed that SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated fusogenicity is closely associated with the efficiency of S1/S2 cleavage ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48.

Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that BA.2 S is more efficiently cleaved than BA.1 S. However, western blotting analysis showed that BA.2 S is less efficiently cleaved than B.1.1 S and that the cleavage efficiencies of BA.1 S and BA.2 S are comparable ( Figure 3 G). These data suggest that BA.2 S exhibits a higher fusogenicity independent of S1/S2 cleavage.
Next, we assessed the features of pseudoviruses. The levels of cleaved S2 in viruses pseudotyped with BA.1 S and BA.2 S were comparable, whereas these S2 levels were lower than those pseudotyped with B.1.1 S ( Figure 3 G). However, the pseudovirus infectivity of BA.2 S was significantly higher than that of BA.1 S ( Figure 3 H). We then analyzed the binding affinity of the BA.2 S receptor-binding domain (RBD) toward ACE2 in a yeast surface display assay ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2022 9.

Ther. 2022; 7 :8 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ), our yeast surface display assay showed that the binding affinity of the BA.2 S RBD is significantly higher than that of the BA.1 S RBD ( Figure 3 I).
We have recently revealed that BA.1 poorly utilizes TMPRSS2 for infection ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). To analyze TMPRSS2 utilization by BA.2 S, we performed a cell-based fusion assay using 293-ACE2 cells with or without TMPRSS2 expression. We verified that endogenous TMPRSS2 was undetectable on the surface of 293-ACE2 cells ( Figure 3 J). As shown in Figure 3 K, the efficiency in mediating syncytia formation of BA.2 S was significantly higher than that of BA.1 in both cell lines. However, although BA.2 S was less fusogenic than B.1.1 S in 293-ACE2 cells, the efficiency in mediating syncytia formation of BA.2 S and B.1.1 S in 293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells was comparable ( Figure 3 K). These results suggest that the relatively higher fusogenicity of BA.2 is dependent on TMPRSS2 expression on the surface of the target cell. To further assess whether a TMPRSS2-dependent increase in infection was also observed when cell-free virus was used, we inoculated 293-ACE2 cells and 293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells with pseudoviruses. Although the infectivity of B.1.1 and Delta was increased 15.3-fold and 24.6-fold, respectively, when TMPRSS2 was expressed on the target cell, the level of TMPRSS2 expression did not affect the infectivity of either BA.1 or BA.2 (Figure 3L). These results suggest that TMPRSS2 does not affect the infectivity of cell-free BA.2 virus.
Our recent study showed that BA.1 prefers the endocytic entry pathway rather than the TMPRSS2-mediated cell surface entry pathway ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). To address whether BA.2 also prefers the endocytic entry route, E64d, a cathepsin inhibitor that blocks the endocytosis-dependent entry of SARS-CoV-2 ( Zhao et al., 2021 65. Zhao, M.M. ∙ Yang, W.L. ∙ Yang, F.Y. ... Cathepsin L plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and humanized mice and is a promising target for new drug development Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 2021; 6 :134 Crossref Scopus (321) PubMed Google Scholar ), was used. Consistent with a previous report ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ), Delta was resistant to E64d (Figure 3M). In contrast, both BA.1 and BA.2 were sensitive to E64d (Figure 3M). We verified that the inhibitory activity of E64d with concentrations did not show cytotoxicity in our experimental setup ( Figure S3 C). These data suggest that the BA.2 virus prefers the endocytosis-dependent entry pathway.
Finally, we investigated the growth of BA.2 in the presence or absence of TMPRSS2. Although the growth of rBA.1 S-GFP and rBA.2 S-GFP was comparable in 293-ACE2 cells, rBA.2 S-GFP was more replicative than rBA.1 S-GFP in 293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells (Figure 3N). Overall, our data suggest that the BA.2 S is involved in stronger efficiency in mediating syncytia formation and more efficient replication than the BA.1 S in a TMPRSS2-dependent manner.
To investigate the dynamics of the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 carrying the BA.2 S in vivo , we conducted hamster infection experiments using the chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 described above ( Figure 3 A). Consistent with our recent study using clinical B.1.1 and BA.1 isolates ( Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ), rB.1.1 S-GFP-infected hamsters exhibited decreased body weight and respiratory disorders, as reflected by two surrogate markers of bronchoconstriction or airway obstruction (enhanced pause [Penh] and the ratio of time to peak expiratory follow relative to the total expiratory time [Rpef]), as well as decreased subcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ). However, the rBA.1 S-GFP-infected hamsters exhibited no respiratory disorder or only slight effects ( Figure 4 A). Notably, all of the routinely measured parameters, including body weight, Penh, Rpef, and SpO 2 , were significantly different between rBA.2 S-GFP-infected hamsters and uninfected or rBA.1 S-GFP-infected hamsters but were comparable between rBA.2 S-GFP-infected and rB.1.1 S-GFP-infected hamsters ( Figure 4 A). These data suggest that the BA.2 S confers higher pathogenicity compared with the BA.1 S.
To analyze viral spread in the respiratory organs of infected hamsters, the viral RNA load and nucleocapsid (N) expression were assessed by RT-qPCR analysis of viral RNA and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. As shown in Figure 4 B, the viral RNA loads in the two lung regions (hilum and periphery) of rBA.2 S-GFP-infected hamsters were significantly higher than those of rBA.1 S-GFP-infected hamsters. In the lung periphery, the viral RNA load of rBA.2 S-GFP was significantly higher than that of rB.1.1 S-GFP, and the viral RNA load of rBA.2 S-GFP at 1 d.p.i. was 11-fold and 9.3-fold higher than those of rB.1.1 S-GFP and rBA.1 S-GFP, respectively, at the same time point ( Figure 4 B). To address the possibility that the BA.2 S-carrying SARS-CoV-2 spreads more efficiently than the BA.1 S-carrying virus, we investigated N protein positivity in the trachea and the lung area close to the hilum. At 1 d.p.i., N protein was detectable in the lower tracheal epithelium in all infected hamsters, and its expression was particularly salient in the middle portion of the trachea in rBA.2 S-GFP-infected hamsters ( Figure S4 A). N protein positivity was observed in both the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia in all infected lungs ( Figure 4 C). Notably, alveolar positivity was observed in rB.1.1 S-GFP- and rBA.2 S-GFP-infected lungs but not in rBA.1 S-GFP-infected lungs ( Figure 4 C). Morphometry showed that the percentage of N-positive cells in rBA.2 S-GFP-infected lungs was significantly higher than that in rBA.1 S-GFP-infected lungs and peaked at 3 d.p.i. ( Figures 4 D and S4 B). On the other hand, the percentage of N-positive cells in the bronchus/bronchioles of rBA.2 S-GFP-infected hamsters at 3 d.p.i. was 5.4-fold lower than that in rBA.1 S-GFP-infected hamsters ( Figure 4 E). At 5 d.p.i., N protein expression had almost disappeared in rBA.1 S-GFP-infected lungs, whereas alveolar staining was still detectable in rB.1.1 S-GFP- and rBA.2 S-GFP-infected lungs ( Figures 4 C, 4D, and S4 B). These data suggest that the BA.2 S contributes to more efficient viral spread though lung tissues compared with the BA.1 S.
To investigate the pathogenicity of BA.2, the right lungs of infected hamsters were collected at 1, 3, and 5 d.p.i. and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and histopathological analysis ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). All histopathological parameters of rBA.2 S-GFP-infected hamsters, including bronchitis/bronchiolitis, hemorrhage, alveolar damage, and the levels of type II pneumocytes, were significantly higher than those of rBA.1 S-GFP-infected hamsters ( Figures 4 F and 4G). The hemorrhage score, including congestive edema, was significantly higher for rBA.2 S-GFP than for rB.1.1 S-GFP ( Figure 4 G). As shown in our previous studies ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48.

Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ), hyperplastic large type II pneumocytes, indicating the severity of inflammation, were observed in all the infected hamsters at 5 d.p.i., and the area of large type II pneumocytes in rBA.2 S-GFP-infected hamsters was significantly larger than that in in rB.1.1 S-GFP- and rBA.1 S-GFP-infected hamsters ( Figure 4 G). The total histology score of rBA.2 S-GFP was significantly higher than that of rBA.1 S-GFP ( Figure 4 G). Furthermore, in rBA.2 S-GFP- and rB.1.1 S-GFP-infected lungs, inflammation with type II alveolar pneumocyte hyperplasia was found in each lobe, especially in the frontal/upper and accessary lobes ( Figures 4 H, 4I, and S4 C).

Section: Discussion

Although BA.2 is considered an Omicron variant, its genomic sequence is much different from that of BA.1, which suggests that the virological characteristics of BA.2 are different from those of BA.1. Herein, we elucidated the virological characteristics of BA.2, which included a higher effective reproduction number and higher fusogenicity and higher pathogenic potential than BA.1. We demonstrated that BA.2 is resistant to BA.1-induced humoral immunity. Using a hamster model and chimeric recombinant viruses harboring the S genes of SARS-CoV-2 variants, we showed that the BA.2 S-bearing virus is more pathogenic than the BA.1 S-bearing virus. Together, our data indicate that BA.2 is virologically distinct from BA.1.
Using three different types of antisera obtained from BA.1-infected individuals and experimental animals (BA.1-infected hamsters and the mice immunized with BA.1 S protein), we demonstrated the resistance of BA.2 to BA.1-induced humoral immunity. Our results indicate that the antigenicity of BA.2 is different from that of BA.1. Additionally, we demonstrated that sera from individuals with breakthrough BA.1 infection (i.e., BA.1 infection after the 2nd vaccination dose) exhibited robust antiviral immunity against BA.1, BA.2, and the other variants tested. On the other hand, sera from BA.1-infected individuals without full vaccination (i.e., only the 1st dose or no vaccination) showed poor antiviral activity against all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested. These data suggest that the antiviral effects of BA.1 infection alone cannot match those of a live attenuated vaccine, but BA.1 infection after full vaccination can boost antiviral effects.
The higher fusogenicity of BA.2 S was a pronounced characteristic observed in the in vitro experiments. The results indicated that Delta S is more highly fusogenic than BA.1 S and B.1.1 S; hence, we hypothesized that the higher fusogenicity could be attributed to the higher efficiency of S cleavage ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ...

Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, BA.2 S exhibited higher fusogenicity than BA.1 S without an increase in S cleavage efficiency. In recent studies ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48.

Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ), we proposed that the fusogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 variant is closely related to its pathogenicity. This hypothesis was further supported by the results for the BA.2 S-bearing virus in the present study. However, unlike Delta, the higher fusogenicity of BA.2 does not appear to be attributed to a higher efficiency of S cleavage ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mlcochova et al., 2021 32.

Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, although TMPRSS2 increased the efficiency of both cell-cell fusion ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cell-free infection mediated by B.1.1 S and Delta S, TMPRSS2 increased the efficiency of BA.2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion but did not affect the efficiency of BA.2 S-mediated cell-free infection. These observations suggest that TMPRSS2 contributes to cell-cell fusion and cell-free infection mediated by BA.2 S via different mechanisms of action.
In our prior studies, which focused on the Delta ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Omicron/BA.1 ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ) variants, SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated fusogenicity was closely associated with the efficiency of S1/S2 cleavage. However, although BA.2 S exhibited higher fusogenicity than BA.1 S, the cleavage efficiency of BA.2 S was comparable with that of the BA.1 S. Additionally, BA.2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion was enhanced by TMPRSS2 expression, whereas BA.2 S-mediated cell-free infection was not, as it favors the TMPRSS2-independent endocytosis-dependent pathway. Although the difference in TMPRSS2 preference between the cell-cell and cell-free BA.2 infection pathways is of scientific interest, the mechanism of action remains unclear. By fully elucidating this mechanism, the virological features of BA.2 could be understood, including its possibly higher pathogenicity, as observed in the hamsters infected with rBA.2 S-GFP virus.
The most critical finding affecting global health is that the BA.2 S-bearing virus exhibits higher pathogenicity than the BA.1 S-bearing virus. Although the BA.2 pathogenicity should be evaluated by clinical studies in depth, our investigations using a hamster model and chimeric recombinant viruses showed that the pathogenicity of the BA.2 S-bearing virus is similar to that of the B.1.1 S-bearing virus and higher than that of the BA.1 S-bearing virus. More importantly, the viral RNA load at the lung periphery and the histopathological disorders associated with BA.2 were more severe than those associated with BA.1 and even B.1.1. Together with the higher effective reproduction number and pronounced immune resistance of BA.2, it is evident that the spread of BA.2 may be a serious global health issue in the near future. In summary, our data suggest that BA.2 may be the most concerning variant for global health identified thus far.
Here, we showed that a recombinant BA.2 virus (rBA.2 S-GFP) is more pathogenic than a recombinant BA.1 virus (rBA.1 S-GFP) in an experimental hamster model ( Figure 4 ). In contrast, it has been recently reported that the risks of infection by and hospitalization from BA.2 are comparable with those of BA.1 in the human population ( Qassim et al., 2022 41. Qassim, S.H. ∙ Chemaitelly, H. ∙ Ayoub, H.H. ... Effects of BA.1/BA.2 subvariant, vaccination, and prior infection on infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infections MedRxiv. 2022; Crossref Google Scholar ; Wolter et al., 2022 59. Wolter, N. ∙ Jassat, W. ∙ Gottberg, A.v. ... Clinical severity of Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 compared to BA.1 in South Africa MedRxiv. 2022; Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This discrepancy might be due to differences between experimental animal models and humans, and findings about disease severity in the hamster model may not reflect the course of human disease with BA.2. However, it should be noted that in recent studies ( Qassim et al., 2022 41. Qassim, S.H. ∙ Chemaitelly, H. ∙ Ayoub, H.H. ... Effects of BA.1/BA.2 subvariant, vaccination, and prior infection on infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infections MedRxiv. 2022; Crossref Google Scholar ; Wolter et al., 2022 59. Wolter, N. ∙ Jassat, W. ∙ Gottberg, A.v. ... Clinical severity of Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 compared to BA.1 in South Africa MedRxiv. 2022; Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), most of individuals surveyed have been vaccinated or experienced previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Because experimental hamsters are immunologically naive, the differences in the results observed between experimental animals and humans might be due to this difference in immunological status. In fact, as of April 2022, a large surge of BA.2 infection, with relatively higher severity and increased hospitalization rates, has been reported from Hong Kong, where the vaccination rate in elderly people is not very high ( HKSAR, 2022 16. HKSAR Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in HK (March 18, 2022) 2022 https://chp-dashboard.geodata.gov.hk/covid-19/en.html Google Scholar ). This might be due to the potentially greater pathogenicity of BA.2.
Another limitation of the present study is the use of a chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2, rBA.2 S-GFP virus, which harbors the BA.2 S gene in a non-BA.2 (PANGO lineage A) genomic backbone ( Figure 3 A), instead of a genuine BA.2 virus. Therefore, the virological features of rBA.2 S-GFP may not completely reflect those of BA.2. For example, although we showed that rBA.2 S-GFP is more pathogenic than rBA.1 S-GFP in a hamster model, a recent study using a clinical isolate of BA.2 showed that the pathogenicity of BA.2 is similar to that of BA.1 in animal models ( Kawaoka et al., 2022 20. Kawaoka, Y. ∙ Uraki, R. ∙ Kiso, M. ... Characterization and antiviral susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron/BA.2 Res. Sq. 2022; PubMed Google Scholar ). The inconsistency of BA.2 pathogenicity found between our study and other’s ( Kawaoka et al., 2022 20. Kawaoka, Y. ∙ Uraki, R. ∙ Kiso, M. ... Characterization and antiviral susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron/BA.2 Res. Sq. 2022; PubMed Google Scholar ) can be explained by the possibility that the BA.2 S is potentially pathogenic, but the non- S region of the BA.2 genome could attenuate its viral pathogenicity. Moreover, we should emphasize the possibility of the emergence of recombinant SARS-CoV-2. In fact, there are some reports showing the recombination between SARS-CoV-2 variants ( Colson et al., 2022 8. Colson, P. ∙ Fournier, P.-E. ∙ Delerce, J. ...

GitHub Potential BA.1/BA.2 recombinant lineage with likely breakpoint at NSP5/NSP6 (267 sequences in the UK and Ireland 2022 https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues/454 Google Scholar ). Overall, the results of this study and others indicate that it might be possible for certain recombinants to emerge that harbor the BA.2 S gene in a non-BA.2 genomic backbone, which can exhibit higher pathogenicity, as shown in this study.

Vaccine sera were collected from sixteen vaccinees four weeks after their second vaccination with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) (average age: 27, range: 20-47, 38% male). Sera obtained from nine vaccinees 10-25 days after their second vaccination with the ChAdOx1 vaccine (Oxford-Astra Zeneca) (average age: 45, range: 35-54; 67% male) were purchased from BioIVT. Sera of thirteen individuals who had BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) (average age: 37, range: 28-53; 54% male) were obtained at one month after the second dose, four months after the second dose, and one month after the third dose. The details of the vaccine sera are summarized in Table S2 .
Convalescent sera were collected from vaccine-naïve individuals who had been infected with the alpha variant (n=8; average age: 41, range: 21-57, 63% male) or Delta variant (n=15; average age: 51, range: 22-67, 80% male). Convalescent sera of BA.1-infected individuals (n=21; average age: 40, range: 16-73; 48% male; 62% had received the second vaccination) were also collected. To identify the SARS-CoV-2 variants infecting patients, saliva was collected from COVID-19 patients during infection onset, and RNA was extracted using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Cat# 52906) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To identified Alpha and Delta variants, viral genome sequencing was performed as previously described ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). For details, see the "Viral genome sequencing" section below. To identify the BA.1 variant, mutation-targeting RT–qPCR was performed. To identify the S E484A substitution (common in all Omicron variants including BA.1 and BA.2), an E484A (SARS-CoV-2) primer/probe set (Takara, Cat# RC322A) was used. To detect the S R214EPE insertion (specific to B.1.1.529 and BA.1, undetectable in BA.2), an in-house-developed protocol was used with the following primers and probe: Omi_ins214s-F1, 5’-TTC TAA GCA CAC GCC TAT TAT AGT GC-3’; Omi_ins214s-R1, 5’-TAA AGC CGA AAA ACC CTG AGG-3’; and Omi_ins214s, FAM-TGA GCC AGA AGA TC-MGB. Sera collected from twelve convalescents during the early pandemic (until May 2020) (average age: 71, range: 52-92, 8% male) were purchased from RayBiotech. Sera were inactivated at 56°C for 30 m and stored at –80°C until use. The details of the convalescent sera are summarized in Table S2 .

Briefly, the virus sequences were verified by viral RNA-sequencing analysis. Viral RNA was extracted using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Cat# 52906). The sequencing library employed for total RNA sequencing was prepared using the NEB next ultra RNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Cat# E7530). Paired-end 76-bp sequencing was performed using a MiSeq system (Illumina) with MiSeq reagent kit v3 (Illumina, Cat# MS-102-3001). Sequencing reads were trimmed using fastp v0.21.0 ( Chen et al., 2018 6. Chen, S. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Chen, Y. ...

Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32752) PubMed Google Scholar ). Variant calling, filtering, and annotation were performed using SAMtools v1.9 ( Li et al., 2009 27. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The sequence alignment/map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38835) PubMed Google Scholar ) and snpEff v5.0e ( Cingolani et al., 2012 7.

To construct a maximum likelihood tree of Omicron lineages (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3) sampled from South Africa, the genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 and its metadata were downloaded from the GISAID database ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ) ( Khare et al., 2021 21. Khare, S. ∙ Gurry, C. ∙ Freitas, L. ... GISAID's role in pandemic response China CDC Wkly. 2021; 3 :1049-1051 Crossref Scopus (511) PubMed Google Scholar ) on January 26, 2022. We excluded the data of viral strains with the following features from the analysis: i) a lack collection date information; ii) sampling from animals other than humans; iii) a low-coverage sequencing flag; or iv) >2% undetermined nucleotide characters. All the BA.2 and BA.3 sequences and 200 randomly sampled BA.1 (including 20 BA.1.1) sequences were used for tree construction, in addition to an outgroup sequence, EPI_ISL_466615, representing the oldest isolate of B.1.1 obtained in the UK. The viral genome sequences were mapped to the reference sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession no.: NC_045512.2 ) using Minimap2 v2.17 ( Li, 2018 25. Li, H. Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :3094-3100 Crossref Scopus (5678) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequently converted to a multiple sequence alignment according to the GISAID phylogenetic analysis pipeline ( https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo ). The alignment sites corresponding to the 1–265 and 29674–29903 positions in the reference genome were masked (i.e., converted to NNN). Alignment sites at which >50% of sequences contained a gap or undetermined/ambiguous nucleotide were trimmed using trimAl v1.2 ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 4. Capella-Gutiérrez, S. ∙ Silla-Martínez, J.M. ∙ Gabaldón, T. trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1972-1973 Crossref Scopus (6625) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phylogenetic tree construction was performed via a three-step protocol: i) the first tree was constructed; ii) tips with longer external branches (Z score > 4) were removed from the dataset; iii) and the final tree was constructed. Tree reconstruction was performed by RAxML v8.2.12 ( Stamatakis, 2014 47. Stamatakis, A. RAxML version 8: a tool for phylogenetic analysis and post-analysis of large phylogenies Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1312-1313 Crossref Scopus (23581) PubMed Google Scholar ) under the GTRCAT substitution model. The node support value was calculated by 100 times bootstrap analysis.
We performed the phylodynamic analysis of Omicron lineages (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3) sampled from South Africa as described below. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence dataset used above was split into each Omicron lineage. As an outgroup, the oldest BA.2 sequence (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_8128463) was added to the BA.1 and BA.3 datasets, and the oldest BA.3 sequence (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_8616600) was added to the BA.2 dataset. The multiple sequence alignment was constructed as described above. A time-calibrated tree of each lineage was constructed by BEAST2 v2.6.6 ( Bouckaert et al., 2014 1. Bouckaert, R. ∙ Heled, J. ∙ Kühnert, D. ... BEAST 2: a software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10 :e1003537 Crossref Scopus (4812) PubMed Google Scholar ). The HKY model ( Hasegawa et al., 1985 15. Hasegawa, M. ∙ Kishino, H. ∙ Yano, T. Dating of the human-ape splitting by a molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA J. Mol. Evol. 1985; 22 :160-174 Crossref Scopus (7141) PubMed Google Scholar ) with four categories of discrete gamma rate variation was selected as a nucleotide substitution model. A relaxed molecular clock modelled based on a log-normal distribution was selected. The exponential growth coalescent model was used. For the BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3 datasets, nineteen, four, and three independent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were run with 2,000,000 warmup and 18,000,000 sampling iterations, respectively. We confirmed that the effective sampling sizes for all parameters were greater than 200, indicating that the MCMC runs were successfully convergent. The maximum credible trees with common ancestor heights are shown in Figure S1 .
The numbers of amino acid differences (including nonsynonymous substitutions, insertions, and deletions) between SARS-CoV-2 lineages were identified as follows (see “Modeling the epidemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineages” section). Information on the amino acid differences of each viral strain compared with the reference sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession no.: NC_045512.2 ) was extracted from GISAID metadata (downloaded on January 26, 2022). In each viral lineage, the amino acid differences that were present in >10% sequences were extracted and subsequently counted. For the comparison of BA.1 and BA.2, the set of symmetric amino acid differences compared with the reference was determined, and the number of differences was subsequently counted.
To quantify the spread rate of each SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the human population, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number of each viral lineage according to the epidemic dynamics, calculated on the basis of viral genomic surveillance data. The data were downloaded from the GISAID database ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ) on February 1, 2022. We excluded the data of viral strains with the following features from the analysis: i) a lack of collection date information; ii) sampling in animals other than humans; or iii) sampling by quarantine. We analyzed the datasets of the eleven countries with >100 available BA.2 sequences (Austria, Denmark, Germany, India, Israel, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the USA) ( Figures 1 and S2 ). The dynamics of BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY lineages) in each country from October 1, 2021, to January 25, 2022, were analyzed. The number of viral sequences of each viral lineage collected on each day in each country was counted. Finally, we constructed an L (lineage) × C (country) × T (time) = 4 × 11 × 117-shaped array, which comprises the count of each viral lineage in each country on each day. This array was used as input data for the statistical model described below.
We constructed a Bayesian hierarchical model to represent relative lineage growth dynamics with multinomial logistic regression. The mathematical theory underlying the model is described in detail elsewhere ( Obermeyer et al., 2022 35. Obermeyer, F. ∙ Schaffner, S.F. ∙ Jankowiak, M. ... Analysis of 2.1 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes identifies mutations associated with transmissibility MedRxiv. 2022; Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Vöhringer et al., 2021 56. Vöhringer, H.S. ∙ Sanderson, T. ∙ Sinnott, M. ... Genomic reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in England Nature. 2021; 600 :506-511 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this model was similar to the model used in our previous study ( Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the present study, we incorporated a hierarchical structure into the slope parameter over time, which enabled us to estimate the global average relative effective reproduction number of each viral lineage as well as the value for each country. Arrays in the model index over one or more indices: L = 4 viral lineages 𝑙 ; C = 11 countries 𝑐 ; and T = 117 days 𝑡 . The model is: β 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ∼ S t u d e n t _ t ⁡ ( 6 , β 𝑙 , σ 𝑙 ) μ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 = α 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 + β 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ t θ . 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 = s o f t m a x ⁡ ( μ . 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ) 𝑦 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ∼ M u l t i n o m i a l ⁡ ( ∑ 𝑙 𝑦 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 , θ . 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 )
The explanatory variable was time, 𝑡 , and the outcome variable was 𝑦 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 , which represented the count of viral lineage 𝑙 in country 𝑐 at time 𝑡 . The slope parameter of lineage 𝑙 in country 𝑐 , β 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 , was generated from a Student’s t distribution with hyperparameters of the mean, β 𝑙 , and the standard deviation, σ 𝑙 . As the distribution generating β 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 , we used a Student’s t distribution with six degrees of freedom instead of a normal distribution to reduce the effects of outlier values of β 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 . In the model, the linear estimator μ . 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 , consisting of the intercept α . 𝑐 and the slope β . 𝑐 , was converted to the simplex θ . 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 , which represented the probability of occurrence of each viral lineage at time 𝑡 in country 𝑐 , based on the softmax link function defined as: s o f t m a x ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) = e x p ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) ∑ 𝑖 e x p ⁡ ( 𝑥 𝑖 )
𝑦 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 is generated from θ . 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 and the total count of all lineages at time 𝑡 in country c according to a multinomial distribution.
The relative effective reproduction number of each viral lineage in each county ( 𝑟 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ) was calculated according to the slope parameter β 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 as: r 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 = e x p ⁡ ( γ ⁢ β 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑐 ) where γ is the average viral generation time (2.1 days) ( http://sonorouschocolate.com/covid19/index.php?title=Estimating_Generation_Time_Of_Omicron ). Similarly, the global average relative effective reproduction number of each viral lineage was calculated according to the slope hyperparameter β 𝑙 as: r 𝑙 = e x p ⁡ ( γ ⁢ β 𝑙 )
For parameter estimation, the intercept and slope parameters of the BA.1 variant were fixed at 0. Consequently, the relative effective reproduction number of BA.1 was fixed at 1, and those of the other lineages were estimated relative to that of BA.1.
Parameter estimation was performed via the MCMC approach implemented in CmdStan v2.28.1 ( https://mc-stan.org ) with CmdStanr v0.4.0 ( https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/ ). Noninformative priors were set for all parameters. Four independent MCMC chains were run with 1,000 and 2,000 steps in the warmup and sampling iterations, respectively. We confirmed that all estimated parameters showed <1.01 R-hat convergence diagnostic values and >200 effective sampling size values, indicating that the MCMC runs were successfully convergent. The fitted model closely recapitulated the observed viral lineage dynamics in each country ( Figure S2 C). The above analyses were performed in R v4.1.2 ( https://www.r-project.org/ ). Information on the relative effective reproduction number of BA.2 estimated in the present study is summarized in Table S1 .
To validate our statistical model used in the present study, we compared the effective reproduction number of BA.2 relative to that of BA.1 in Denmark estimated by our model and that by another group ( Ito et al., 2022 18. Ito, K. ∙ Piantham, C. ∙ Nishiura, H. Estimating relative generation times and relative reproduction numbers of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 with respect to Delta in Denmark MedRxiv. 2022; Crossref Google Scholar ). We confirmed that the relative effective reproduction number of BA.2 in Denmark estimated by our model (1.28) is comparative with that by the previous study (1.26) ( Table S1 ).
Plasmids expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins of B.1.1 (the parental D614G-bearing variant), Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2) and BA.1 variants were prepared in our previous studies ( Kimura et al., 2022 22.

Plasmids expressing the codon-optimized S proteins of BA.2 and a BA.2 derivative that loses its cytoplasmic tail were generated by site-directed overlap extension PCR using the primers listed in Table S3 . The resulting PCR fragment was digested with KpnI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding site of the pCAGGS vector ( Niwa et al., 1991 34. Niwa, H. ∙ Yamamura, K. ∙ Miyazaki, J. Efficient selection for high-expression transfectants with a novel eukaryotic vector Gene. 1991; 108 :193-199 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). To construct the plasmids expressing anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab, imdevimab or sotrovimab), the sequences of the variable regions of these antibodies were obtained from KEGG Drug Database ( https://www.genome.jp/kegg/drug/ ) and were artificially synthesized (Fasmac). The obtained coding sequences of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains were cloned into the pCAGGS vector containing the sequences of the human immunoglobulin 1 and kappa constant region [kindly provided by Dr. Hisashi Arase (Osaka University, Japan)]. Nucleotide sequences were determined by DNA sequencing services (Eurofins), and the sequence data were analyzed by Sequencher v5.1 software (Gene Codes Corporation).
Casirivimab, imdevimab and sotrovimab were prepared as previously described ( Liu et al., 2021b 29. Liu, Y. ∙ Arase, N. ∙ Kishikawa, J.-i. ...

Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (657) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the pCAGGS vectors containing the sequences encoding the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains were cotransfected into HEK293T cells using PEI Max (Polysciences, Cat# 24765-1). At 48 h posttransfection, the cell culture supernatants were harvested, and the antibodies were purified using NAb protein A plus spin kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 89948) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The SARS-CoV-2 S-immunized mouse sera were prepared as previously described ( Liu et al., 2021b 29. Liu, Y. ∙ Arase, N. ∙ Kishikawa, J.-i. ... The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is poised to acquire complete resistance to wild-type spike vaccines bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Google Scholar ). To prepare the immunogen, B16F10 cells (2,500,000 cells) were transfected with 5 μg S expression plasmid by PEI Max (Polysciences, Cat# 24765-1) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Two days posttransfection, the transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, and then the cell pellets were stored at –80°C (10,000,000 cells per stock). The expression of transfected S protein was verified by flow cytometry and western blot. BALB/c mice (female, 7 weeks old) were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. For the immunization, mice were subcutaneously immunized with the freeze-thawed S-expressing B16F10 cells in 50% complete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# F5881). Three weeks after immunization, blood was collected in BD microtainer blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences, Cat# 365967) and sera were collected by centrifugation.

Briefly, the SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses (counting ∼20,000 relative light units) were incubated with serially diluted (40-fold to 29,160-fold dilution at the final concentration) heat-inactivated sera or monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab, imdevimab or sotrovimab) at 37°C for 1 h. Pseudoviruses without sera were included as controls. Then, an 80 μl mixture of pseudovirus and serum/antibody was added to HOS-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells/50 μl) in a 96-well white plate. At 2 d.p.i., the infected cells were lysed with a One-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Cat# E6130) or a Bright-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Cat# E2650), and the luminescent signal was measured using a GloMax explorer multimode microplate reader 3500 (Promega) or CentroXS3 (Berthhold Technologies). The assay of each serum was performed in triplicate, and the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) was calculated using Prism 9 software v9.1.1 (GraphPad Software).

To prepare GFP-expressing replication-competent recombinant SARS-CoV-2, we used fragment 9, in which the GFP gene was inserted in the ORF7a frame, instead of the authentic F9 fragment (see Figure 3 A and Table S3 ) ( Torii et al., 2021 50. Torii, S. ∙ Ono, C. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

To generate chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2, rBA.1 S-GFP and rBA.2 S-GFP (summarized in Figure 3 A), mutations were inserted in fragment 8 ( Table S3 ) using the GENEART site-directed mutagenesis system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# A13312) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the primers listed in Table S3 . A recombinant SARS-CoV-2 that bears D614G S (rB.1.1 S-GFP) was prepared in our previous study ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). To prepare a rDelta S-GFP ( Figure 3 A), the fragment of viral genome that corresponds to the region of fragment 8 ( Table S3 ) was subcloned from a Delta isolate (strain TKYTK1734; GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_2378732) ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nucleotide sequences were determined by a DNA sequencing service (Fasmac), and the sequence data were analyzed by Sequencher software v5.1 (Gene Codes Corporation).
To produce recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (seed viruses), the CPER products were transfected into HEK293-C34 cells using TransIT-LT1 (Takara, Cat# MIR2300) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At one day posttransfection, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM (high glucose) (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 6429-500ML) containing 2% FBS, 1% PS and doxycycline (1 μg/ml; Takara, Cat# 1311N). At six days posttransfection, the culture medium was harvested and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected as the seed virus. To remove the CPER products (i.e., SARS-CoV-2-related DNA), 1 ml of the seed virus was treated with 2 μl TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# AM2238) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Complete removal of the CPER products from the seed virus was verified by PCR. The working virus stock was prepared using the seed virus as described below (see “SARS-CoV-2 preparation and titration” section).
The working virus stocks of chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rB.1.1 S-GFP, rDelta S-GFP, rBA.1 S-GFP and rBA.2 S-GFP) were prepared and titrated as previously described ( Motozono et al., 2021 33.

Establishment of a reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV-2 using circular polymerase extension reaction Cell Rep. 2021; 35 :109014 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 20 μl of the seed virus was inoculated into VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (5,000,000 cells in a T-75 flask). One hour postinfection (h.p.i.), the culture medium was replaced with DMEM (low glucose) (Wako, Cat# 041-29775) containing 2% FBS and 1% PS. At 3 d.p.i., the culture medium was harvested and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected as the working virus stock.
The titer of the prepared working virus was measured as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ). Briefly, one day before infection, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells) were seeded into a 96-well plate. Serially diluted virus stocks were inoculated into the cells and incubated at 37°C for 4 d. The cells were observed under microscopy to judge the CPE appearance. The value of TCID 50 /ml was calculated with the Reed–Muench method ( Reed and Muench, 1938 42. Reed, L.J. ∙ Muench, H. A simple method of estimating fifty percent endpoints Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27 :493-497 Google Scholar ).
To verify the sequence of chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2, viral RNA was extracted from the working viruses using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Cat# 52906) and viral genome sequence was analyzed as described above (see "Viral genome sequencing" section). In brief, the viral sequences of rB.1.1 S-GFP, rDelta S-GFP, rBA.1 S-GFP and rBA.2 S-GFP were used for the reference. Information on the unexpected mutations detected is summarized in Table S4 , and the raw data are deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number: GSE196649 ).
One day before infection, Vero cells (10,000 cells), VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells), Calu-3 cells (20,000 cells), HEK293-ACE2 cells (10,000 cells), HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells), were seeded into a 96-well plate. SARS-CoV-2 [100 TCID 50 for VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells ( Figure 3 B), 1,000 TCID 50 for Vero cells ( Figure 3 B), HEK293-ACE2 cells (10,000 cells) (Figure 3N), and HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells) (Figure 3N); and 2,000 TCID 50 for Calu-3 cells ( Figure 3 B)] was inoculated and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. The infected cells were washed, and 180 μl culture medium was added. The culture supernatant (10 μl) was harvested at the indicated timepoints and used for RT–qPCR to quantify the viral RNA copy number (see “RT–qPCR” section below).
The infection experiment primary human nasal epithelial cells ( Figure 3 B) was performed as previously described ( Meng et al., 2022 31. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ...

Briefly, the working viruses were diluted with Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 11058021). The diluted viruses (1,000 TCID 50 in 100 μl) were inoculated onto the apical side of the culture and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The inoculated viruses were removed and washed twice with Opti-MEM. To harvest the viruses on the apical side of the culture, 100 μl Opti-MEM was applied onto the apical side of the culture and incubated at 37°C for 10 m. The Opti-MEM applied was harvested and used for RT–qPCR to quantify the viral RNA copy number (see “RT–qPCR” section below).

Briefly, 5 μl culture supernatant was mixed with 5 μl 2 × RNA lysis buffer [2% Triton X-100 (Nacalai Tesque, Cat# 35501-15), 50 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40% glycerol, 0.8 U/μl recombinant RNase inhibitor (Takara, Cat# 2313B)] and incubated at room temperature for 10 m. RNase-free water (90 μl) was added, and the diluted sample (2.5 μl) was used as the template for real-time RT-PCR performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using One Step TB Green PrimeScript PLUS RT-PCR kit (Takara, Cat# RR096A) and the following primers: Forward N , 5'-AGC CTC TTC TCG TTC CTC ATC AC-3'; and Reverse N , 5'-CCG CCA TTG CCA GCC ATT C-3'. The viral RNA copy number was standardized with a SARS-CoV-2 direct detection RT-qPCR kit (Takara, Cat# RC300A). Fluorescent signals were acquired using QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad), Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumina), qTOWER3 G Real-Time System (Analytik Jena) or 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Mounting solution containing 3% FBS and 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (Wako, Cat# 039-01335) was overlaid, followed by incubation at 37°C. At 3 d.p.i., the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate (Nacalai Tesque, Cat# 09154-85). The fixed cells were washed with tap water, dried, and stained with staining solution [0.1% methylene blue (Nacalai Tesque, Cat# 22412-14) in water] for 30 m. The stained cells were washed with tap water and dried, and the size of plaques was measured using Fiji software v2.2.0 (ImageJ).
Coculture experiment ( Figure S3 B) was performed as previously described ( Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). This assay utilizes a dual split protein (DSP) encoding Renilla luciferase and GFP genes; the respective split proteins, DSP 8-11 and DSP 1-7 , are expressed in effector and target cells by transfection. Briefly, one day before transfection, effector cells (i.e., S-expressing cells) were seeded on the poly-L-lysine (Sigma, Cat# P4832) coated coverslips put in a 12-well plate, and target cells were prepared at a density of 100,000 cells in a 12-well plate. To prepare effector cells, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the S-expression plasmids (500 ng) and pDSP 8-11 (500 ng) using PEI Max (Polysciences, Cat# 24765-1). To prepare target cells, HEK293 and HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were transfected with pDSP 1-7 (500 ng) ( Kondo et al., 2011 23. Kondo, N. ∙ Miyauchi, K. ∙ Matsuda, Z.

VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, HEK293-ACE2 cells and HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were transfected with pDSP 1-7 (400ng). On day 3 (24 h posttransfection), 16,000 effector cells were detached and reseeded into 96-well black plates (PerkinElmer, Cat# 6005225), and target cells (HEK293 cells, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 or Calu-3/DSP 1-7 cells) were reseeded at a density of 1,000,000 cells/2 ml/well in 6-well plates. On day 4 (48 h posttransfection), target cells were incubated with EnduRen live cell substrate (Promega, Cat# E6481) for 3 h and then detached, and 32,000 target cells were added to a 96-well plate with effector cells. Renilla luciferase activity was measured at the indicated time points using Centro XS3 LB960 (Berthhold Technologies). To measure the surface expression level of S protein, effector cells were stained with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 S S1/S2 polyclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# PA5-112048, 1:100). Normal rabbit IgG (Southern Biotech, Cat# 0111-01, 1:100) was used as negative controls, and APC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 111-136-144, 1:50) was used as a secondary antibody. Surface expression level of S proteins ( Figure 3 E) was measured using FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software v10.7.1 (BD Biosciences). To calculate fusion activity, Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to the MFI of surface S proteins. The normalized value (i.e., Renilla luciferase activity per the surface S MFI) is shown as fusion activity.

The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S B.1.1, BA.1, and BA.2 RBDs to human ACE2 were titrated by flow cytometry. The CF640-labelled ACE2 at 12–14 different concentrations (200 nM to 13 pM in PBS supplemented with bovine serum albumin at 1 g/l) per measurement were incubated with expressed yeast aliquots and 1 nM bilirubin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 14370-1G) and analyzed by using FACS S3e cell sorter device (Bio-Rad) as previously described ( Kimura et al., 2022 22.

To measure the surface expression level of TMPRSS2 ( Figure 3 J), HEK293-ACE2 cells and HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were stained with rabbit anti-TMPRSS2 polyclonal antibody (BIOSS, Cat# BS-6285R, 1:100). Normal rabbit IgG (Southern Biotech, Cat# 0111-01, 1:100) was used as negative controls, and APC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 111-136-144, 1:50) was used as a secondary antibody. Surface expression level of TMPRSS2 was measured using FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software v10.7.1 (BD Biosciences).
One day before infection, HOS-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells) were seeded into a 96-well plate. The next day, the cells were treated with the indicated doses of E64d (Aloxistatin) (Selleck, Cat# S7393) for 1 h, then infected with the pseudoviruses. At 2 d.p.i., the infected cells were lysed with a Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Cat# E2620), and the luminescent signal was measured using a GloMax Explorer Multimode Microplate Reader (Promega). The assay of each pseudovirus was performed in triplicate, and the IC50 was calculated using Prism 9 software v9.1.1 (GraphPad Software).
The cytotoxicity of E64d (Aloxistatin) ( Figure S3 C) was tested using the cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo, Cat# CK04-11) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, one day before the assay, HOS-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells) were seeded into a 96-well plate. The cells were cultured with the serially diluted compound for 48 h. The cell counting kit-8 solution (10 μl) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 90 m. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a GloMax Explorer Microplate Reader (Promega).
Animal experiments ( Figure 4 ) were performed as previously described ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Syrian hamsters (male, 4 weeks old) were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). Baseline body weights were measured before infection. For the virus infection experiments, hamsters were anaesthetized by intramuscular injection of a mixture of either 0.15 mg/kg medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitor®, Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo), 2.0 mg/kg midazolam (FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals, Cat# 135-13791) and 2.5 mg/kg butorphanol (Vetorphale®, Meiji Seika Pharma), or 0.15 mg/kg medetomidine 0butorphanol. The chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rB.1.1 S-GFP, rDelta S-GFP, rBA.1 S-GFP and rBA.2 S-GFP) (10,000 TCID 50 in 100 μl), or saline (100 μl) were intranasally inoculated under anesthesia. Oral swabs were daily collected under anesthesia with isoflurane (Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma). Body weight, enhanced pause (Penh), the ratio of time to peak expiratory follow relative to the total expiratory time (Rpef) and subcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) were routinely monitored at indicated timepoints (see “Lung function test” section below). Respiratory organs were anatomically collected at 1, 3 and 5 d.p.i (for lung) or 1 d.p.i. (for trachea). Viral RNA load in the respiratory tissues were determined by RT–qPCR. The respiratory tissues were also used for histopathological and IHC analyses (see “H&E staining” and “IHC” sections below). Sera of infected hamsters were collected at 16 d.p.i. using cardiac puncture under anesthesia with isoflurane and used for neutralization assay (see “Neutralization assay” above).
Lung function test ( Figure 4 A) was performed as previously described ( Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Respiratory parameters (Penh and Rpef) were measured by using a whole-body plethysmography system (DSI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, a hamster was placed in an unrestrained plethysmography chamber and allowed to acclimatize for 30 s, then, data were acquired over a 4-m period by using FinePointe Station and Review softwares v2.9.2.12849 (STARR). The state of oxygenation was examined by measuring SpO 2 using pulse oximeter, MouseOx PLUS (STARR). SpO 2 was measured by attaching a measuring chip to the neck of hamsters sedated by 0.25 mg/kg medetomidine hydrochloride.
IHC ( Figures 4 C, S2 A, and S4 B) was performed as previously described ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ) using an Autostainer Link 48 (Dako). The deparaffinized sections were exposed to EnVision FLEX target retrieval solution high pH (Agilent, Cat# K8004) for 20 m at 97°C to activate, and mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 N monoclonal antibody (clone 1035111, R&D systems, Cat# MAB10474-SP, 1:400) was used as a primary antibody. The sections were sensitized using EnVision FLEX (Agilent) for 15 m and visualized by peroxidase-based enzymatic reaction with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dako, Cat# DM827) as substrate for 5 m. The N protein positivity ( Figures 4 D and 4E) was evaluated by certificated pathologists as previously described ( Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Images were incorporated as virtual slide by NDP.scan software v3.2.4 (Hamamatsu Photonics). The N-protein positivity was measured as the area using Fiji software v2.2.0 (ImageJ).
H&E staining ( Figures 4 F, 4H, and S4 C) was performed as previously described ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, excised animal tissues were fixed with 10% formalin neutral buffer solution, and processed for paraffin embedding. The paraffin blocks were sectioned with 3 μm-thickness and then mounted on MAS-GP-coated glass slides (Matsunami Glass, Cat# Cat# S9901). H&E staining was performed according to a standard protocol.
Histopathological scoring ( Figure 4 G) was performed as previously described ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pathological features including bronchitis or bronchiolitis, hemorrhage with congestive edema, alveolar damage with epithelial apoptosis and macrophage infiltration, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, and the area of the hyperplasia of large type II pneumocytes were evaluated by certified pathologists and the degree of these pathological findings were arbitrarily scored using four-tiered system as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). The "large type II pneumocytes" are the hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes exhibiting more than 10-μm-diameter nucleus. We described "large type II pneumocytes" as one of the remarkable histopathological features reacting SARS-CoV-2 infection in our previous studies ( Saito et al., 2022 43. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 48. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total histology score is the sum of these five indices.
To measure the inflammation area in the infected lungs ( Figure 4 I), four hamsters infected with each virus were sacrificed at the 1, 3 and 5 d.p.i., and all four right lung lobes, including upper (anterior/cranial), middle, lower (posterior/caudal), and accessory lobes, were sectioned along with their bronchi. The tissue sections were stained by H&E, and the digital microscopic images were incorporated into virtual slides using NDP.scan software v3.2.4 (Hamamatsu Photonics). The inflammatory area including type II pneumocyte hyperplasia in the infected whole lungs was morphometrically analyzed using Fiji software v2.2.0 (ImageJ).
Statistical significance was tested using a two-sided Mann–Whitney U -test, a two-sided Student's t -test or a two-sided paired t -test unless otherwise noted. The tests above were performed using Prism 9 software v9.1.1 (GraphPad Software).
In the time-course experiments ( Figures 3 B, 3F, 3K, 3N, 4 A, 4B, 4D, and 4G), a multiple regression analysis including experimental conditions (i.e., the types of infected viruses) as explanatory variables and timepoints as qualitative control variables was performed to evaluate the difference between experimental conditions thorough all timepoints. P value was calculated by a two-sided Wald test. Subsequently, familywise error rates (FWERs) were calculated by the Holm method. These analyses were performed in R v4.1.2 ( https://www.r-project.org/ ).
In Figures 4 C, 4F, 4H, and S4 , photographs shown are the representative areas of at least two independent experiments by using four hamsters at each timepoint. In Figures 3 C and S3 , photographs shown are the representatives of >20 fields of view taken for each sample.
