Title: Mitocytosis, a migrasome-mediated mitochondrial quality-control process


Abstract: Summary

Damaged mitochondria need to be cleared to maintain the quality of the mitochondrial pool. Here, we report mitocytosis, a migrasome-mediated mitochondrial quality-control process. We found that, upon exposure to mild mitochondrial stresses, damaged mitochondria are transported into migrasomes and subsequently disposed of from migrating cells. Mechanistically, mitocytosis requires positioning of damaged mitochondria at the cell periphery, which occurs because damaged mitochondria avoid binding to inward motor proteins. Functionally, mitocytosis plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial quality. Enhanced mitocytosis protects cells from mitochondrial stressor-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial respiration; conversely, blocking mitocytosis causes loss of MMP and mitochondrial respiration under normal conditions. Physiologically, we demonstrate that mitocytosis is required for maintaining MMP and viability in neutrophils in vivo . We propose that mitocytosis is an important mitochondrial quality-control process in migrating cells, which couples mitochondrial homeostasis with cell migration.

Section: Introduction

As vital organelles for eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are subject to tight quality control ( Youle, 2019 26. Youle, R.J. Mitochondria—Striking a balance between host and endosymbiont Science. 2019; 365 :eaaw9855 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). Various mechanisms, including mitochondrial proteases, proteasome-mediated degradation of outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) proteins, degradation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs), and mitophagy have been shown play important roles in mitochondrial quality control ( Pickles et al., 2018 14.

Biol. 2018; 28 :R170-R185 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1273) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most of the known mechanisms to remove damaged mitochondria are based on protease- or proteasome-mediated degradation of mitochondria or mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondria can be shed from cells through various mechanisms ( Davis et al., 2014 1. Davis, C.H. ∙ Kim, K.Y. ∙ Bushong, E.A. ... Transcellular degradation of axonal mitochondria Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :9633-9638 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hayakawa et al., 2016 3. Hayakawa, K. ∙ Esposito, E. ∙ Wang, X. ...

Melentijevic, I. ∙ Toth, M.L. ∙ Arnold, M.L. ... C. elegans neurons jettison protein aggregates and mitochondria under neurotoxic stress Nature. 2017; 542 :367-371 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ) or serve as a mechanism to mediate horizontal transfer of mitochondria between cells ( Hayakawa et al., 2016 3.

Migrasomes are organelles in migrating cells ( Ma et al., 2015 11. Ma, L. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Peng, J. ... Discovery of the migrasome, an organelle mediating release of cytoplasmic contents during cell migration Cell Res. 2015; 25 :24-38 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). During cell migration, retraction fibers are pulled from the rear end of cells, and large vesicular structures named migrasomes grow on the retraction fibers. When the cell migrates away, the retraction fibers break and migrasomes are left behind. Cellular contents such as vesicles and cytosol can be released from the cell through migrasomes. Migrasome formation depends on migration. Blocking migration using the Myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin, or by modulating cell adhesion, inhibits migrasome formation ( Wu et al., 2017 25. Wu, D. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Ding, T. ... Pairing of integrins with ECM proteins determines migrasome formation Cell Res. 2017; 27 :1397-1400 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Members of the tetraspanin family have emerged as key regulators of migrasome formation. A subset of tetraspanins, including TSPAN4 and TSPAN9, can induce migrasome formation when overexpressed. Conversely, knocking out the most highly expressed migrasome-forming tetraspanins impairs migrasome formation. Migrasome formation is mediated by assembly of tetraspanin-enriched macrodomains, which increase the bending rigidity of the migrasomal membrane and promote migrasome formation through a biophysical process that we named as the membrane stiffening model ( Huang et al., 2019 5. Huang, Y. ∙ Zucker, B. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Migrasome formation is mediated by assembly of micron-scale tetraspanin macrodomains Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :991-1002 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recently, migrasomes have been shown to play a key role in zebrafish organogenesis ( Jiang et al., 2019 7. Jiang, D. ∙ Jiang, Z. ∙ Lu, D. ... Migrasomes provide regional cues for organ morphogenesis during zebrafish gastrulation Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :966-977 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). During zebrafish embryo development, developmental cues such as chemokines, morphogens, and growth factors are enriched in migrasomes and delivered to spatially restricted locations in the embryo to modulate organogenesis. Thus, migrasomes are organelles for non-autonomous cell-cell communication. Whether migrasomes have autonomous functions is not known.

Section: Results

We started by examining L929 cells expressing TSPAN4-GFP, which labels migrasomes, and MitoDsRed, which labels mitochondria. When we treated the cells with the oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3 chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 2 μM), we observed the MitoDsRed signal inside migrasomes ( Figure 1 A). To verify this observation biochemically, we isolated migrasomes before and after CCCP treatment. We found that proteins from the mitochondrial outer membrane, inner membrane, and matrix do indeed accumulate in migrasomes after CCCP treatment ( Figure 1 B). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that, after CCCP treatment, mitochondria indeed accumulate inside migrasomes. We named these mitochondrion-containing migrasomes as mitosomes. Detailed analysis showed that these mitochondria are small, with an average size of 240 nm. These structures are evidently mitochondria, but not MDVs, as the mitochondrial inner membrane and cristae are clearly visible. The swollen mitochondrial cristae imply that the mitochondria inside migrasomes may have been damaged. A single mitosome can contain multiple mitochondria ( Figure 1 C). Since migrasomes are eventually left behind the migrating cell, the translocation of mitochondria into migrasomes suggests that mitochondria can be cleared from cells by migrasomes. We named this process as mitocytosis.
We found that as low as 1 μM CCCP is enough to induce mitocytosis. In cells treated with 10 μM CCCP, which is the dose used for inducing mitophagy, mitocytosis is barely induced ( Figures 1 D). The rate of mitocytosis is modest, with eviction of an average of 4.4 mitochondrial puncta per hour ( Figure 1 E). Besides CCCP, all the mitochondrial stressors we tested (Deferiprone [DFP], Antimycin A, and Oligomycin) can induce mitocytosis ( Figures 1 F–1H). In addition, we found that starvation also enhances mitocytosis ( Figure 1 I). CCCP treatment induced mitocytosis in all the cultured mammalian cells we tested ( Figures 1 J–1M). These data suggest that mitocytosis is a general mechanism that is activated by various mitochondrial stresses and in a variety of cells.
Next, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying mitocytosis. We found that, during mitocytosis, the highly dynamic tubular mitochondria have extensive outward extensions. Once the tips of tubular mitochondria reach the proximity of the plasma membrane, the tips undergo fission from the mitochondrial network, generating fragments that adhere to areas close to the plasma membrane. Eventually, when the cells migrate away, the “trapped” mitochondrial fragments are left on the retraction fibers and subsequently move into migrasomes ( Figure 2 A; Video S2 ). In contrast, in the control cells, although mitochondria extend to the plasma membrane, these mitochondria just retract away from the plasma membrane ( Video S1 ).

Mitocytosis is induced in the presence of 2 μM CCCP, related to Figure 2 L929 cells stably expressing TSPAN4-GFP and MitoDsRed were cultured on FN-coated dishes in the presence of 2 μM CCCP. The mitocytosis process was observed by a NIKON A1 confocal microscope. Time interval, 87 s. Scale bar, 5 μm.
TEM analysis revealed that the mitochondrial network is segmented into two zones ( Figure S1 A). In areas close to the bottom of the cell immediately above the plasma membrane, almost all mitochondria have a condensed matrix and swollen cristae, which indicates that these mitochondria are damaged. Some of these damaged mitochondria are localized at the entrance of retraction fibers. Treatment with 2 μM CCCP enhances the number of mitochondria on the bottom of cells. In the middle section of cells (along the y axis), most mitochondria still retain their normal morphology, even in cells treated with 2 μM CCCP ( Figures 2 B–2D). These data suggest that damaged mitochondria are transported to the bottom of the cell and are eventually left behind the cell by mitocytosis.
Next, we studied the role of various factors that contribute to mitochondrial dynamics. The outward movement of mitochondria is mediated by KIF5B ( Tanaka et al., 1998 20. Tanaka, Y. ∙ Kanai, Y. ∙ Okada, Y. ... Targeted disruption of mouse conventional kinesin heavy chain, kif5B, results in abnormal perinuclear clustering of mitochondria Cell. 1998; 93 :1147-1158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ); we found that KIF5B is required for mitocytosis. In KIF5B knockdown cells, mitocytosis is dramatically reduced ( Figure 2 E; Figure S2 A). Detailed analysis using time-lapse microscopy showed that the outward mobility of mitochondria is markedly reduced in KIF5B-deficient cells ( Figure 2 H; Video S4 ). This results in shrinkage of the mitochondrial network to the peri-nuclear region. These data indicate that proximity to the plasma membrane, which is mediated by the outward motor KIF5B, is necessary for mitocytosis.

KIF5B is required for outward extension of mitochondria during mitocytosis, related to Figure 2 KIF5B knockdown L929 cells stably expressing TSPAN4-GFP and MitoDsRed were cultured on FN-coated dishes in the presence of 2 μM CCCP. The mitocytosis process was observed by a NIKON A1 confocal microscope. Time interval, 45 s. Scale bar, 5 μm.
Next, we investigated the roles of the mitochondrial fusion/fission machinery ( Hoppins and Nunnari, 2012 4. Hoppins, S. ∙ Nunnari, J. Cell Biology. Mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis--the ER connection Science. 2012; 337 :1052-1054 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ; Youle and van der Bliek, 2012 27. Youle, R.J. ∙ van der Bliek, A.M. Mitochondrial fission, fusion, and stress Science. 2012; 337 :1062-1065 Crossref Scopus (2607) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that knocking down Drp1, the mitochondrial fission factor, blocks mitocytosis ( Figure 2 F; Figure S2 A). However, knocking down MFN1/MFN2, the mitochondrial fusion factors, only has a marginal effect in promoting mitocytosis ( Figures S2 A and S2B).
Time-lapse imaging revealed that under CCCP treatment, mitochondria extended into the area close to the plasma membrane and appeared to be trapped in that area ( Figure 2 H; Video S3 ). Myosin19 is a mitochondrion-associated myosin that can bind both mitochondria and actin. Myo19 has been shown to mediate the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced translocation of mitochondria to filopodia ( Shneyer et al., 2017 19. Shneyer, B.I. ∙ Usaj, M. ∙ Wiesel-Motiuk, N. ... ROS induced distribution of mitochondria to filopodia by Myo19 depends on a class specific tryptophan in the motor domain Sci Rep. 2017; 7 :11577 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, Myo19 has been shown to tether the mitochondria to cortical actin on the plasma membrane ( Quintero et al., 2009 16. Quintero, O.A. ∙ DiVito, M.M. ∙ Adikes, R.C. ... Human Myo19 is a novel myosin that associates with mitochondria Curr. Biol. 2009; 19 :2008-2013 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shneyer et al., 2016 18. Shneyer, B.I. ∙ Ušaj, M. ∙ Henn, A. Myo19 is an outer mitochondrial membrane motor and effector of starvation-induced filopodia J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 :543-556 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). As we expected, we found that knockdown of Myo19 blocked mitocytosis ( Figure 2 G; Figure S2 A). In KIF5B knockdown cells, the mitochondrial network shrinks to the peri-nuclear region, and there are very few outward extensions of mitochondria to the plasma membrane ( Figure 2 H; Video S4 ). In Myo19 knockdown cells, the extension of mitochondria is only slightly affected ( Figure 2 H; Video S5 ). However, the remaining highly dynamic tubular mitochondria that extend to the plasma membrane in Myo19 knockdown cells rarely adhere in the vicinity of the plasma membrane area; they just retract back quickly ( Figure 2 H; Video S5 ).

Myosin19 affects outward extension and peripheral retention of mitochondria during mitocytosis, related to Figure 2 Myosin19 knockdown L929 cells stably expressing TSPAN4-GFP and MitoDsRed were cultured on FN-coated dishes in the presence of 2 μM CCCP. Mitocytosis was observed by a NIKON A1 confocal microscope. Time interval, 45 s. Scale bar, 5 μm.
Overexpressing Myo19 is sufficient to promote mitocytosis, overexpression of Myo19-W140V, which lacks mobility but retains its mitochondrial localization and actin-binding activity, can still promote mitocytosis, suggesting that Myo19 may contribute to mitocytosis mainly by tethering mitochondria to the cortical actin network on the plasma membrane ( Figure 2 I).
Put together, these data suggest that KIF5B mediates mitocytosis by pulling mitochondria to the plasma membrane, where Myo19 tethers mitochondria to cortical actin, which is tightly associated with the plasma membrane. Finally, the tips of tubular mitochondria, which bind to cortical actin, undergo Drp1-mediated fission and are then sent into migrasomes ( Figure 2 J).
We noticed that knocking down dynein, the inward motor on microtubules ( Sheng, 2014 17. Sheng, Z.H. Mitochondrial trafficking and anchoring in neurons: New insight and implications J. Cell Biol. 2014; 204 :1087-1098 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ), is sufficient to trigger mitocytosis in cells that are not exposed to mitochondrial stressors ( Figure S2 C). Mitocytosis triggered by dynein knockdown can be blocked by knocking down KIF5B, Drp1, or Myo19 ( Figures S2 D–S2F). This suggests that mitocytosis triggered by dynein knockdown is regulated by the same pathway as mitochondrial stressor-induced mitocytosis.
TEM images reveal that the majority of mitochondria inside migrasomes have a condensed matrix and swollen cristae, which suggests that these mitochondria may be damaged ( Figure 3 A). To directly test this hypothesis, we stained cells with MitoSOX, a dye that labels mitochondria with high ROS, a sign of damaged mitochondria. Indeed, the vast majority of mitochondria inside migrasomes are MitoSOX positive ( Figure 3 B). Similarly, most mitochondria in migrasomes are TMRM negative, which suggests that the mitochondria in migrasomes have lost their membrane potential ( Figure 3 C).
Next, we asked whether mitochondria lost their mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) before or after mitocytosis. When we treated cells with CCCP and then stained them with TMRM, we found that the majority of mitochondria localized at the entrance of retraction fibers are TMRM negative ( Figure S3 A). This suggests that mitochondria lose their MMP before they are translocated into migrasomes. Similarly, when we treated cells with Antimycin A, we found the majority of mitochondria at the entrance of retraction fibers are MitoSOX positive ( Figure S3 B), which suggests that mitochondrial damage occurs prior to mitocytosis. Our TEM analysis showed that damaged mitochondria are enriched on the bottom of cells. To characterize the properties of mitochondria in different regions of the cell, we carried out 3D confocal imaging analysis of cells, focusing on the bottom, middle, and top planes. We found indeed that the majority of mitochondria in the bottom of cells had lost their MMP after CCCP treatment, while, in the middle section, the majority of mitochondria still have normal MMP ( Figure S3 D). Similarly, the Mito-SOX signal is also much higher in mitochondria in the bottom layer of cells treated with Antimycin A compared to the middle section ( Figure S3 C). These data suggest that loss of MMP and generation of ROS occur prior to mitocytosis ( Figure S3 E).
If mitocytosis can expel damaged mitochondria, we reasoned that mitochondria with a deleterious mutation in mtDNA should be selectively disposed of by mitocytosis. We tested this hypothesis using a cell model of mitochondrial heteroplasmy ( Liu et al., 2009 10. Liu, C.Y. ∙ Lee, C.F. ∙ Wei, Y.H. Activation of PKCdelta and ERK1/2 in the sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis of human cells harboring 4977 bp deletion of mitochondrial DNA Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792 :783-790 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Porteous et al., 1998 15. Porteous, W.K. ∙ James, A.M. ∙ Sheard, P.W. ... Bioenergetic consequences of accumulating the common 4977-bp mitochondrial DNA deletion Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257 :192-201 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wei et al., 2001 23. Wei, Y.H. ∙ Lee, C.F. ∙ Lee, H.C. ... Increases of mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial genome in association with enhanced oxidative stress in human cells harboring 4,977 BP-deleted mitochondrial DNA Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2001; 928 :97-112 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this model, both wild-type (WT) mitochondria and mitochondria harboring mutant mtDNA with a 4,977 bp deletion of electron transport chain (ETC) genes are present ( Figure 3 D). We found that mitochondria harboring mutant mtDNA is selectively enriched in migrasomes ( Figures 3 E and 3F), which suggests that mitochondria with deleterious mtDNA mutations are selectively disposed of by mitocytosis.
How the damaged mitochondria are sensed and transported into migrasomes? TEM analysis revealed that damaged mitochondria may be selectively transported to the cell periphery ( Figure 2 B). To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the recruitment of KIF5B and dynein onto isolated mitochondria. We found that treatment of cells with 10 μM CCCP dramatically decreased the mitochondrial recruitment of dynein and increased the recruitment of KIF5B. In contrast, treating cells with 2 μM CCCP only slightly decreased the recruitment of dynein onto mitochondria, while there was no detectable effect on the recruitment of KIF5B ( Figure 4 A). The small effect on KIF5B and dynein recruitment to mitochondria in cells treated with 2 μM CCCP is not surprising, because, at this dose, only a very small fraction of mitochondria is damaged.
We devised an in vitro assay to further verify this observation. In this assay, the mitochondria isolated from control cells or cells treated with 10 μM CCCP were incubated with the S-100 cytosol fraction isolated from an untreated cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged KIF5B and mCherry-tagged DYNLL1. After incubation, the mitochondria were washed and analyzed for recruitment of the exogenous tagged proteins ( Figure 4 B). We found that indeed the mitochondria from the CCCP-treated cells had a significantly reduced ability to recruit dynein, while their ability to recruit KIF5B was dramatically enhanced ( Figure 4 C).
To directly test whether damaged mitochondria are disassociated from dynein and selectively recruit KIF5B, we carried out a modified in vitro binding assay that allows us to distinguish between the normal and damaged mitochondria. In this assay, mitochondria are damaged by treating cells with 2 μM CCCP, and the isolated mitochondria are then subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on the low or high MMP and used in the binding assay as described above ( Figures 4 D and 4E). We found that both the high TMRM and low TMRM populations of mitochondria can recruit a similar level of KIF5B ( Figure 4 F). This indicates that the enhanced KIF5B recruitment to mitochondria in 10 μM CCCP-treated cells ( Figure 4 C) results from the global increase of KIF5B recruitment to mitochondria. However, we found that recruitment of dynein is significantly reduced in the low TMRM population ( Figure 4 F), which suggests that damaged mitochondria do tend to bind less dynein.
These data suggest that, in CCCP-treated cells, damaged mitochondria signal their status and subsequently move to the cell periphery through their intrinsic avoidance of binding dynein, the inward motor, and through globally enhanced KIF5B recruitment to mitochondria.
We reasoned that if mitocytosis can dispose of damaged mitochondria, it may serve as a mitochondrial quality control mechanism to protect mitochondria during stress. To test this hypothesis, we generated cell lines in which either migrasome formation or mitochondrial translocation to migrasomes is enhanced. To enhance migrasome formation, we overexpressed TSPAN4 or TSPAN9, as we previously demonstrated that overexpressing these tetraspanins significantly enhances migrasome formation. To elevate the translocation of mitochondria into migrasomes, we knocked down dynein, which results in enhanced translocation of mitochondria into migrasomes. We found that overexpressing TSPAN4 or TSPAN9, or knocking down dynein, markedly protected cells from CCCP-induced loss of MMP ( Figures 5 A). To test whether this protective effect is indeed due to mitocytosis, we knocked down KIF5B in TSPAN4- or TSPAN9-overexpressing cells and in dynein knockdown cells. We found that KIF5B knockdown abolished the protective effect of tetraspanin overexpression and dynein knockdown ( Figure 5 B). This suggests that the protective effect of these manipulations is due to mitocytosis.
We reasoned that tetraspanin overexpression or dynein knockdown protected cells from CCCP-induced loss of MMP by enhancing mitocytosis over time, and therefore we should see enhanced recovery of MMP in these cells after acute CCCP treatment. To test this hypothesis, we first treated control, TSPAN4-expressing and dynein knockdown cells with CCCP for 1 h and then cultured them in normal medium for an additional 9 h. We found that, after 1 h of CCCP treatment, all the cells have similar MMP. However, after culture for 9 h in normal medium, the TSPAN4-expressing cells and the dynein knockdown cells have higher MMP than after 1 h of CCCP treatment, while, in control cells, the recovery is much weaker. This result suggests that mitocytosis promotes recovery of MMP over time ( Figures S4 A–S4C).
We also tested the spare respiration capacity of mitochondria by seahorse analysis. We found that overexpression of TSPAN4 or TSPAN9, or knockdown of dynein, preserved the spare respiration capacity after CCCP treatment ( Figure 5 C). Finally, we used the MtKeima assay to assess the mitophagy level as a proxy for mitochondrial damage. We found that 2 μm CCCP treatment induces a weak mitophagy signal, which can be reduced by enhanced mitocytosis. In contrast, 10 μM CCCP induces a strong mitophagy signal, which cannot be reduced by enhanced mitocytosis ( Figure S4 D). These data are consistent with the notion that mitocytosis can mitigate mitochondrial damage induced by mild mitochondrial stress.
Mitochondrial respiration is coupled with generation of ROS, which can cause mitochondrial damage. We speculated that mitocytosis may play a role in maintaining mitochondrial quality in cells that are not exposed to mitochondrial stressors. To test this hypothesis, we blocked the translocation of mitochondria into migrasomes by knocking down KIF5B. We also blocked migrasome formation by inhibiting cell migration. We found that both treatments markedly reduced the MMP ( Figure 5 D). Conversely, overexpression of TSPAN4 or TSPAN9, or knockdown of dynein, significantly elevated the MMP ( Figure 5 E). Blocking mitocytosis also reduces the spare respiration capacity ( Figure 5 F), while elevating mitocytosis enhances it ( Figure 5 G).
Macrophages are capable of generating migrasomes and CCCP can trigger mitocytosis ( Figures 1 L, S5 A, and S5B). We found that bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) can form migrasomes on a glass surface without any coating but not on a surface that had undergone hydrophilic treatment ( Figure 6 A), which significantly reduced the migration of macrophages. Remarkably, simply culturing BMDMs on a hydrophilic surface caused significant loss of MMP, which suggests that migrasome formation is required for maintaining MMP in BMDMs ( Figure 6 B).
To further test the role of mitocytosis in BMDMs, we generated TSPAN9 knockout mice ( Figure 6 C). We isolated monocytes from WT and TSPAN9 −/− mice and then differentiated them into BMDMs ex vivo . We found that the migrasome formation is markedly reduced in BMDMs derived from TSPAN9 −/− mice ( Figure 6 D). Moreover, these BMDMs have significant loss of MMP compared to those from WT mice ( Figures 6 E).
To determine whether the loss of membrane potential is caused by mitocytosis or by a function of TSPAN9 independent of mitocytosis, we transfected TSPAN9 −/− macrophages with TSPAN9 and then cultured these cells on an untreated surface or a hydrophilic surface. Expressing TSPAN9 partially restored the formation of migrasomes and MMP in cells grown on the untreated migrasome-forming surface but not in cells grown on the treated surface, which does not support migrasome formation ( Figures 6 F and 6G). Thus, TSPAN9 likely regulates MMPthrough mitocytosis.
To study the role of mitocytosis in a more physiologically relevant setting, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from WT and TSPAN9 −/− mice. We found that the MMP is reduced in TSPAN9 −/− peritoneal macrophages ( Figure 7 H). Interestingly, there was no difference in the MMP of immobile hepatocytes isolated from WT and TSPAN9 −/− , which indicates that knockout of TSPAN9 does not affect MMP in immobile cells ( Figure 6 I).
To investigate the physiological roles of mitocytosis in vivo , we choose neutrophils as our subject of study as they are highly migratory cells that are very abundant in the circulation. To label the neutrophils in mice, we injected PE-labeled anti-Ly-6G into the tail vein. We used one-photon spinning-disk microscopy to observe the liver and spleen. Although this imaging approach cannot observe deep into tissue, the blood vessels on the surface of tissues can nevertheless be very clearly observed.
We found that our in vivo staining approach labeled neutrophils efficiently. As shown in Figure 7 A and Video S6 , we found that migrasomes were extensively generated by circulating neutrophils. Next, we tested whether migrasomes generated by neutrophils contain mitochondria. We isolated the neutrophils and stained them with Mito-SOX to label damaged mitochondria and then we injected these neutrophils back into mice. We found that indeed many of the migrasomes generated by neutrophils contain Mito-SOX signal ( Figure 7 B). When we isolated migrasomes from blood, we found that around 87% of them originated from neutrophils ( Figure 7 C). We subjected the migrasomes to ultra-thin sectioning and examined them by TEM. The isolated migrasomes are highly homogeneous and share the morphological hallmarks of migrasomes. Importantly, many of the isolated migrasomes contain damaged mitochondria ( Figure 7 D). Accordingly, the isolated migrasomes contain various migrasomal and mitochondrial markers ( Figure 7 E). Thus, mitocytosis does occur in vivo .

Generation of migrasomes by circulating neutrophils, related to Figure 7 Intravital imaging of mice liver neutrophils. Mice were injected with anti-mouse Ly-6G (Gr-1) PE (to label neutrophils) and AF647-WGA (to label blood vessels) by tail intravenous (i.v.) injection. Imaging was carried out by spinning-disk confocal microscopy. Scale bar, 10 μm.
Next, we investigate migrasome formation in TSPAN9 −/− mice. To directly compare the rate of migrasome formation between WT and knockout neutrophils, we isolated neutrophils from WT and TSPAN9 −/− mice and labeled them with different colors. We then injected the WT/TSPAN9 −/− neutrophil mixture into WT mice ( Figure 7 F). As shown in Figures 7 G and 7H and Video S7 , we found that the formation of migrasomes by TSPAN9 −/− neutrophils is significantly reduced.

The formation of migrasomes by neutrophils from TSPAN9 −/− mice is significantly reduced, related to Figure 7 Intravital imaging of mouse liver neutrophils. WT and TSPAN9−/− neutrophils were isolated and labeled with anti-mouse Ly-6G (Gr-1) PE and AF647 anti-mouse Ly-6G respectively, then combined in equal numbers and injected back into the blood vessels of WT mice. Intravital imaging of mouse liver was performed by spinning-disk microscopy. AF488-WGA was injected (i.v.) to label blood vessels before neutrophil injection. Scale bar, 20 μm.
To test whether reduced mitocytosis affects mitochondrial quality control, we isolated neutrophils from spleen and then measured their MMP. We found there are two populations of neutrophils, one with higher MMP, and the other with lower MMP. In the majority of WT mice, most neutrophils are in the higher MMP population. In contrast, in TSPAN9 −/− mice, despite the considerable variation between different animals, the percentage of neutrophils with higher MMP is greatly reduced ( Figure 7 I).
To distinguish between the roles of TSPAN9 and migrasomes in mitochondrial quality control, we measured the MMP in mature neutrophils in bone marrow. Neutrophils are produced and matured in the bone marrow and then migrate into the circulation, where they undergo long-distance migration before reaching the spleen. We reasoned that, if migrasomes, but not TSPAN9, are required to maintain mitochondrial quality, there should be less difference between the MMP of WT and TSPAN9 −/− bone-marrow neutrophils than between WT and TSPAN9 −/− spleen neutrophils. This is because bone-marrow neutrophils have not yet undergone their long-distance migration, and therefore mitocytosis has not yet kicked in. Indeed, we found there is almost no difference in MMP between WT and TSPAN9 −/− bone-marrow neutrophils ( Figure 7 J). These data suggest that it is migrasomes, and not TSPAN9, that contribute to mitochondrial quality control.
Finally, we explored the physiological consequence of impaired mitocytosis in neutrophils. It is well established that accumulation of damaged mitochondria can impair the viability of cells. Thus, we measured the number of mature neutrophils in bone morrow and spleen of WT and TSPAN9 −/− mice. We found that the number of neutrophils in bone marrow is very similar in both genotypes ( Figure 7 K), which indicates that the generation and maturation of neutrophils are normal in TSPAN9 −/− mice. However, compared to WT mice, the number of neutrophils in spleen is reduced in TSPAN9 −/− mice, which suggests that TSPAN9 −/− neutrophils may have reduced viability ( Figure 7 L). To directly test the viability of neutrophils, we isolated bone-marrow neutrophils from WT and TSPAN9 −/− mice and then labeled them with different doses of CFSE and injected equal numbers back into WT mice ( Figure 7 M). We found that after 1 day’s circulation, WT neutrophils significantly outnumber TSPAN9 −/− neutrophils ( Figures 7 M and 7N), which suggests that mitocytosis does contribute to the viability of neutrophils in the circulation.

Section: Discussion

Compared to stationary cells, migrating cells need to consume more energy to support migration, and thus they likely have a higher respiration rate, higher ROS generation, and a higher mitochondrial stress load. Therefore, migrating cells require additional mechanisms to mitigate this higher mitochondrial stress burden. It makes sense that mitocytosis, which is intrinsically associated with migration, is the mechanism of choice for mitochondrial quality control in migrating cells. In this sense, mitocytosis couples mitochondrial homeostasis with cell migration.
Mitocytosis is induced by mild mitochondrial stress. It is worth noting that 10 μM CCCP, which is the dose used to induce mitophagy, only marginally induces mitocytosis. This is probably explained by the fact that cells are barely migrating in the presence of 10 μM CCCP. We speculate that mitocytosis and mitophagy may serve as a two-gear system to maintain mitochondrial quality in migrating cells, with mitocytosis dealing with mild mitochondrial damage, which likely occurs frequently under physiological conditions, while mitophagy deals with severe mitochondrial damage related to pathological conditions.
The rate of mitocytosis is fairly low, which is not unexpected. Mitocytosis is a mitochondrial quality-control process for dealing with the very mild mitochondrial stress, which cells may encounter in physiological conditions. Thus, we do not expect that migrating cells will expel large amounts of mitochondria via mitocytosis. Damaged mitochondria release cytochrome C, which can trigger activation of the self-amplifying caspase cascade. Therefore, accumulation of even small numbers of damaged mitochondria may have a drastic effect in the long run. By continually removing damaged mitochondria, mitocytosis can help cells avoid the adverse effects associated with accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. This notion is supported by our data showing that cell viability and MMP are reduced in neutrophils with impaired migrasome formation.
In this study, we found that motor proteins such as KIF5B and dynein contribute to mitochondria quality control by playing key roles in regulating mitocytosis. It is worth noting that KIF5B and dynein may contribute to mitochondrial quality control through other mechanisms, as it has been reported that mitochondria can provide ROS to the leading edge of migrating cells, where ROS can regulate actin dynamics and be consumed during this process ( Wang et al., 2011 22. Wang, Y. ∙ Zang, Q.S. ∙ Liu, Z. ... Regulation of VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 301 :C695-C704 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilson and González-Billault, 2015 24. Wilson, C. ∙ González-Billault, C. Regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics by redox signaling and oxidative stress: implications for neuronal development and trafficking Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2015; 9 :381 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mitochondrial dynamics is regulated by motor proteins, and ROS is an important source of mitochondrial toxicity. Thus, mitochondrial trafficking, which is mediated by motor proteins, may also contribute to the role of motor proteins in regulating mitochondrial quality control.
We propose that mitocytosis is a mitochondrial quality-control process in migrating cells. At this point, at least 3 important questions remain. (1) We showed that mitocytosis maintains mitochondrial quality and viability in neutrophils. Our analysis is limited to mice in the steady state. Future studies using an infection model are required to establish the role of mitocytosis in the immune response. In addition, the study should also be extended to other types of migratory immune cells. (2) We found that damaged mitochondria intrinsically avoid binding to the inward motor protein. However, the cues that signal the status of damaged mitochondria for mitocytosis still remain elusive. (3) It remains to be tested whether or not mitocytosis has other functions, for example, horizontal transfer of mitochondria between cells.

L929, NRK and MiaCaPa-2 cells were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone) medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Biological Industries), 2 mM GlutaMAX and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin in 5% CO 2 at 37°C. HUVEC cells were grown in ECM (ScienCell) supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% ECGS and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin.
Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were obtained from WT or TSPAN9−/− C57BL/6 mice as previously described ( Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2010 2. Fernandes-Alnemri, T. ∙ Yu, J.W. ∙ Juliana, C. ... The AIM2 inflammasome is critical for innate immunity to Francisella tularensis Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11 :385-393 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ). Monocytes and BMDMs were maintained in L929 conditioned medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% L929 supernatant and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin) for 5 days. Suspension cells were discarded and adherent BMDMs were used in the following experiments.
Peritoneal macrophages were acquired from WT or TSPAN9−/− C57BL/6 mice as described previously ( Ji et al., 2019 6. Ji, L. ∙ Zhao, X. ∙ Zhang, B. ... Slc6a8-Mediated Creatine Uptake and Accumulation Reprogram Macrophage Polarization via Regulating Cytokine Responses Immunity. 2019; 51 :272-284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.0 mL of 4% sterile thioglycollate. After 4 days, thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were isolated from peritoneum by lavage using 5 mL PBS. Peritoneal macrophages stained with APC anti-mouse F4/80 Antibody (BioLegend) were analyzed by flow cytometry.
The heteroplasmic cells harboring 20% wild-type mtDNA and 80% mtDNA with a 4977-bp deletion of the ETC genes were made by fusing mtDNA-less (ρ0) human 143B osteosarcoma cells with denucleated skin fibroblasts ( Liu et al., 2009 10. Liu, C.Y. ∙ Lee, C.F. ∙ Wei, Y.H. Activation of PKCdelta and ERK1/2 in the sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis of human cells harboring 4977 bp deletion of mitochondrial DNA Biochim. Biophys.

The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 μg/ml pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, 200 U/ml penicillin G, 200 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37°C.
Neutrophil isolation was performed using Anti-Ly-6G MicroBeads UltraPure (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-120-337). Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated and treated with Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK) lysis buffer for 2 min to lyse red blood cells. The mixture of bone marrow cells was then incubated with Anti-Ly-6G MicroBeads for 20 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended with PBS (containing 2% FBS) and subjected to positive selection through LS Columns (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-042-401) on a QuadroMACS Separator (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-051). The columns were disconnected from the separator, and the neutrophils were washed out with 5 mL PBS (containing 2% FBS).
We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out Tspan9 in C57BL/6 mice. The sgRNA sequence used for CRISPR/Cas9 was 5′-GAAGGTGGCGAAGTTGCCTT-3′. Gender- and age-matched WT C57BL/6 mice were used as controls for TSPAN9−/− animals. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in a temperature- and light-regulated room in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions and received food and water ad libitum . All animal procedures and experiments were performed following the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Research Center of Tsinghua University. Protocols for mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tsinghua University. The laboratory animal facility has been licensed by the Science and Technology Commission of Beijing Municipality (SYXK-2014-0024) and accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.
Vigofect was used for cell transfection according to the manufacturer’s manual. Cells were seeded in a 35 mm dish and grown to 80% confluency, and then transfected with 200 μL NaCl (150 mM) that contained 2 μL Vigofect and 5 μg plasmid. The transfection mix was replaced with fresh medium after 4-6 hr. Cells were cultured for another 20 hr for protein expression.
Lentiviral production and infection were conducted as previously described ( Jiao et al., 2015 8. Jiao, H. ∙ Su, G.Q. ∙ Dong, W. ... Chaperone-like protein p32 regulates ULK1 stability and autophagy Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22 :1812-1823 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the manufacturer’s instructions (MISSION Lentiviral Packaging Mix). Briefly, lentivirus was produced from 293T cells transfected with lentiviral vectors using the above Vigofect transfection protocol. For virus infection, cells were seeded in a 35 mm dish at 50%–60% density. Growth medium was removed and virus-containing polybrene (8 μg/ml) was added to cells. After 24 hours, cells were selected in fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin until drug-resistant colonies became visible. pLKO.1-puro vectors bearing shRNA were used for knockdown, and plvx-puro vectors encoding TSPAN9-mCherry were used for rescue in TSPAN9 KO BMDMs. shRNA sequences were as follows: mouse KIF5B: 5′-CCTATGTTCCTTATCGAGATA-3′, mouse DYNLL1: 5′-GCTTAGTATCTTTGTGCTCAA-3′, mouse Drp1: 5′-GCTTCAGATCAGAGAACTTAT-3′, mouse MFN1: 5′-GCGTTTAAGCAGCAGTTTGTA-3′, mouse MFN2: 5′-GCTACAGCTCATCATCAGTTA-3′, mouse DYNLL1: 5′-GCCCATATCAAGAAGGAGTTT-3′, mouse Itgβ1: 5′-GCACGATGTGATGATTTAGAA-3′.
The PiggyBac Transposon Vector System was used to generate the L929 stably expressing cell lines. L929 cells were co-transfected with pB (transposon vector) and pBASE (transposase vector) at a ratio of 1:3. After 24 hr, the cells were selected in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 or 200 μg/ml hygromycin B for 3-5 days, followed by single cell sorting with a fluorescence activated cell sorting. These single cell clones were further identified using confocal microscopy.
Migrasome isolation was performed by iodixanol-sucrose density gradient centrifugation using an Optiprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich, LYSISO1), and the procedure was based on a modification of previous protocols ( Ma et al., 2015 11. Ma, L. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Peng, J. ... Discovery of the migrasome, an organelle mediating release of cytoplasmic contents during cell migration Cell Res. 2015; 25 :24-38 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were grown in 150 mm dishes precoated with fibronectin (1 μg/ml) in full DMEM medium for 12 hr. Growth medium was disposed of and cells were washed to remove other extracellular vesicles in the medium. Cells were trypsinized and collected in 50 mL tubes. All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4°C. Cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min followed by 4000 g for 20 min. Crude migrasomes were then collected as the pellet by centrifugation at 18,000 g for 30 min. Migrasome fractionation was performed by density gradient centrifugation, using Optiprep as the density medium. The crude migrasome sample was prepared by first resuspending the pellet with 400 μl 1 × extraction buffer mixed with 400 μl 10% Optiprep. First, a step gradient was built starting with 50% (500 μl), followed by 40% (500 μl), 35% (500 μl), 30% (500 μl), 25% (500 μl), 20% (500 μl), 15% (500 μl), 10% (500 μl), 5% (500 μl) and crude migrasomes (5%, 800 μl). Second, the prepared gradient was centrifuged at 150,000 g for 4 hr at 4°C in an MLS-50 rotor (Beckman). Third, samples were collected from top to bottom (500 μl per fraction). Each fraction was mixed with the same volume of PBS (500 μl) and centrifuged at 18,000 g for 30 min to collect the pellet. The pellets were washed with PBS and centrifuged again at 18,000 g for 30 min. The samples were compatible with western blot analysis, TEM, cryo-EM and mass spectrometry.
35 mm confocal dishes were precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) at 37°C for 1 hour. Cells were cultured in fibronectin-precoated confocal dishes for 10-12 hr. Confocal snapshot images were acquired using a NIKON A1RSiHD25 laser scanning confocal microscope at 1024 × 1024 pixels. For live-cell imaging, cells were cultured in fibronectin-precoated confocal dishes for 4-6 hours before imaging. Cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 , and monitored with a NIKON A1 microscope at 1024 × 1024 pixels. Images were processed with ImageJ and Imaris software 8.1.4, and statistical analyses were conducted using Graphpad Prism 5. For presentation, final images were deconvoluted by NIS-Elements analysis 5.0 software.
Cells were grown in 35 mm dishes precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml). After 10-12 hours, cells were pre-fixed using a 1:1 ratio of growth medium to 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were further fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PB buffer for 2 hours at room temperature, washed three times with PBS and dehydrated in an ascending gradual series of ethanol (50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, and 100%) for 8 min each. Samples were infiltrated with and embedded in SPON12 resin. After polymerizing for 48 h at 60°C, 70-nm-thick ultrathin sections were cut using a diamond knife, and then picked up with Formvar-coated copper grids (100 mesh). The sections were double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. After air drying, samples were examined with a transmission electron microscope H-7650B at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV.
Cells or migrasomes were lysed by SDS lysis buffer (2.5% in PBS), then boiled for 10-20 min at 95°C. Equal amounts of protein were separated on SDS-PAGE gels of an appropriate percentage according to the MW of target proteins, followed by electrophoretic transfer onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer, and incubated with primary antibody in solution 1 (TOYOBO) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature, and signals were detected with a WESTAR ηC 2.0 kit (CYANAGEN).
The following primary antibodies were used for western blot analyses at the indicated dilution: anti-TOM20 (1:5000), anti-TIM23 (1:5000), anti-HSP60 (1:5000), anti-GAPDH (1:5000), anti-Integrin α5 (1:1000), anti-KIF5B (1:5000), anti-Drp1 (1:2000), anti-MFN1 (1:1000), anti-MFN2 (1:1000) anti-DYNLL1 (1:5000), anti-MYO19 (1:1000) and anti-Integrin β1 (1:1000).
Mitochondrial fractionation was performed following published protocols with minor modifications ( Tanaka et al., 1998 20. Tanaka, Y. ∙ Kanai, Y. ∙ Okada, Y. ... Targeted disruption of mouse conventional kinesin heavy chain, kif5B, results in abnormal perinuclear clustering of mitochondria Cell. 1998; 93 :1147-1158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS several times, suspended and broken in H-S buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 320 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors) by passing 15 times through 1 mL syringes fitted with 27G needles. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 11 400 × g for 20 min at 4°C to precipitate the crude mitochondrial fraction. The pellet was resuspended in H-S buffer and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. First, the centrifuge tube was layered with a HEPES-buffered sucrose step density gradient (0.3 mL of 2.3 M, 1.7 mL of 1.7 M, and 1.5 mL of 1 M). Then, the crude mitochondrial fraction was layered on the top of the sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the mitochondria accumulated at the interface of the 1 M and 1.7 M sucrose layers. 500 μL of the 1 M/1.7 M interface was recovered, diluted 3-fold with H-S buffer, and pelleted by centrifuging for 10 min at 11 400 × g. This wash step was repeated 3 times.
The S-100 cytosol fraction was prepared as described previously with some modifications ( Liu et al., 1996 9. Liu, X. ∙ Kim, C.N. ∙ Yang, J. ... Induction of apoptotic program in cell-free extracts: requirement for dATP and cytochrome c Cell. 1996; 86 :147-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4592) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in ice-cold buffer S (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors). After sitting on ice for 15 min, the cells were lysed by 15 passes through 1 mL syringes fitted with 27G needles. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the nuclei, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant (S-100 cytosol) was used for the in vitro cell-free system assay.
Mitochondrial fractions and S-100 cytosolic fractions were obtained as described above from L929 cells. The in vitro mitochondrial pull-down assay was performed according to established protocols with some modifications ( MacDonald et al., 1999 12. MacDonald, G. ∙ Shi, L. ∙ Vande Velde, C. ... Mitochondria-dependent and -independent regulation of Granzyme B-induced apoptosis J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189 :131-144 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 100 μL diluted mitochondria (500 μg/ml) were mixed with 1 mL L929 S-100 cytosol in dilution buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM DTT) for 4 hr at 37°C. After incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged to pellet the mitochondria, and the purified mitochondria were washed three times and then run on SDS-PAGE gels followed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies.
Mitochondrial ROS production was measured using MitoSOX probe according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Life Technologies). In brief, cells were cultured in fibronectin-precoated confocal dishes and treated as described. Cells were gently washed once with PBS and then were incubated with 3 μM MitoSOX Red and 1 μg/ml WGA in HBSS for 10 min at 37°C. After three gentle washes with warm PBS, cells were cultured in HBSS and subjected to confocal analysis.
TMRM and JC-1 were used to determine mitochondrial membrane potential according to the manufacturer’s manual. Briefly, after treatment as described, cells were gently washed once with warm PBS. Cells were incubated in either TMRM or JC-1 working solution for 20 min at 37°C, and then gently washed three times with warm PBS. For flow cytometry assay, cells were trypsin-digested and suspended in HBSS. The TMRM intensity in different groups was measured by FACS (Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX LX) and analyzed using CytExpert software. Data were obtained from three independent experiments, and 50,000 cells were examined per group in each experiment. For microscopy assay, cells stained with WGA were immersed in HBSS and then imaged as quickly as possible. Confocal images were acquired using a NIKON A1 microscope.
Oxygen consumption rates of cells were measured with the Seahorse XF e 96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, after treatment as described, 5000 cells (per well) were cultured in FN-precoated XF e 96 well plates with medium for 12 hr. Before measurement, cell medium was replaced by XF assay medium (XF Base Medium supplemented with 25 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, 6 mM L-glutamine and adjusted to pH 7.4). Cells were then maintained in 175 μL/well of XF assay medium at 37°C in an incubator without supplied CO 2 for 1 hour. During the incubation time, 16 μM oligomycin (8 × ), 18 μM FCCP (9 × ), 10 μM rotenone (10 × ) and 10 μM antimycin A (10 × ) in XF assay medium were successively loaded into the injection ports in the XF e 96 sensor cartridge. The assay procedure was set as ‘Mix-03:00, Wait-00:00, Measurement-03:00’ for 4 cycles. After measurement, cells were digested with trypsin and counted for cell number. Oxygen consumption rates of cells were normalized to cell number. Datasets were analyzed by Wave software (Agilent Technologies).
For neutrophil imaging, 5 mg of AF647-WGA (Thermo Fisher, W32466) and 1 μg of PE-Ly-6G/Ly-6C antibody (eBioscience, 12-5931-82) were injected into C57BL6/J mice (male, 8-12 weeks) by intravenous injection (i.v.). After 5 min, anesthesia was induced in the mice by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of Avertin (375 mg/kg). Subsequently, the mice were dissected to expose the liver on a plate with a round cover glass in the center for spinning-disk confocal microscopy imaging.
For Mito-SOX staining imaging, neutrophils were isolated from bone marrow of C57BL6/J mice and stained with Mito-SOX red (1:400) and AF647-Ly-6G antibody (BioLegend, 127610, 1:200) at 37°C for 30 min. Neutrophils were washed and injected into the spleen of anesthetized mice. Subsequently, the mice were dissected to expose the liver on a plate with a round cover glass in the center for spinning-disk confocal microscopy imaging.
For WT and TSPAN9−/− neutrophil imaging, neutrophils were isolated from WT and TSPAN9−/− mice, and then stained with PE-Ly-6G/Ly-6C antibody and AF647-Ly-6G antibody, respectively. Equal numbers of neutrophils were washed with PBS and combined together for injection into the spleen of C57BL6/J mice which had been injected (i.v.) with 5 mg AF647-WGA to label vessels. Subsequently, the mice were anesthetized and dissected to expose the liver on a plate with a round cover glass in the center for spinning-disk confocal microscopy imaging.
Anesthesia was induced in the mice by Avertin injection (375 mg/kg, i.p.), and blood was collected from the ocular venous plexus and put into a tube containing blood collection buffer (PBS+10 mM EDTA) on ice. The blood mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 g, 4°C for 5 min, followed by 2000 g, 4°C for 15 min to remove the blood cells and finally at 20000 g, 4°C for 40 min. The pellet is the crude migrasome fraction.
Bone marrow neutrophils were isolated from WT and TSPAN9−/− mice, and labeled with 0.5 μM CFSE (CFSE low ) (BestBio, BB-4211-500T) and 5 μM CFSE (CFSE high ) respectively. WT and TSPAN9−/− neutrophils were then combined together in equal numbers and injected back into the tail vein of C57BL6/J mice. After 16-24 hours, spleen cell suspensions were isolated and treated with ACK buffer to lyse the red blood cells. Red blood cell-free spleen cells were stained with a Zombie NIR Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend, 423105) and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Viable cells were gated on the CFSE low and CFSE high populations and analyzed for cell number.
Spleen cell suspensions and/or bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated and treated with ACK buffer to lyse the red blood cells. Red blood cell-free spleen cells or bone marrow cells were stained with AF647 anti-mouse Ly-6G (1:200), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-CD11b (1:200) and TMRM for 15 min at 4°C, and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis with a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX LX. Viable cells were gated on the Ly-6G+/CD11b+ population and analyzed for TMRM intensity and/or cell numbers.
