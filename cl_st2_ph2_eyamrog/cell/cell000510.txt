Title: Xist nucleates local protein gradients to propagate silencing across the X chromosome


Abstract: Summary

The lncRNA Xist forms ∼50 diffraction-limited foci to transcriptionally silence one X chromosome. How this small number of RNA foci and interacting proteins regulate a much larger number of X-linked genes is unknown. We show that Xist foci are locally confined, contain ∼2 RNA molecules, and nucleate supramolecular complexes (SMACs) that include many copies of the critical silencing protein SPEN. Aggregation and exchange of SMAC proteins generate local protein gradients that regulate broad, proximal chromatin regions. Partitioning of numerous SPEN molecules into SMACs is mediated by their intrinsically disordered regions and essential for transcriptional repression. Polycomb deposition via SMACs induces chromatin compaction and the increase in SMACs density around genes, which propagates silencing across the X chromosome. Our findings introduce a mechanism for functional nuclear compartmentalization whereby crowding of transcriptional and architectural regulators enables the silencing of many target genes by few RNA molecules.

Section: Introduction

Mammalian genomes encode thousands of long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, many of which play key roles in regulating gene expression by localizing effector proteins to genomic targets ( Engreitz et al., 2016 35. Engreitz, J.M. ∙ Ollikainen, N. ∙ Guttman, M. Long non-coding RNAs: spatial amplifiers that control nuclear structure and gene expression Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2021; 22 :96-118 Google Scholar ). There has been considerable debate about how lncRNAs can robustly regulate gene expression, given that they are often expressed at low levels ( Cabili et al., 2015 15.

One such example is the Xist lncRNA, which silences transcription of a large number of genes across an entire chromosome.
Xist is transcribed from, coats, and silences one of the two X chromosomes during development of female placental mammals in a process referred to as X chromosome inactivation (XCI) ( Brockdorff et al., 2020 14.

Xist initiates gene silencing, large-scale chromatin remodeling, and formation of a unique nuclear compartment, the inactive X chromosome (Xi), through the recruitment of chromatin-modifying proteins, transcriptional silencers, and other RNA-binding proteins ( Chaumeil et al., 2006 20.

However, a subset of X-linked genes also requires other Xist -interactors for silencing, including non-canonical PRC1-type Polycomb group protein complexes and the architectural protein structural-maintenance of chromosomes hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1) ( Almeida et al., 2017 1.

PRC1 collaborates with SMCHD1 to fold the X-chromosome and spread Xist RNA between chromosome compartments Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2950 Google Scholar ). Moreover, some X-linked genes become repressed sooner than others ( Barros de Andrade E. Sousa et al., 2019 3. Barros de Andrade E. Sousa, L. ∙ Jonkers, I. ∙ Syx, L. ... Kinetics of Xist -induced gene silencing can be predicted from combinations of epigenetic and genomic features Genome Res. 2019; 29 :1087-1099 Google Scholar ). Why X-linked genes differ in their silencing dynamics and require multiple repressive pathways for inactivation remain major questions.
Based on conventional fluorescence microscopy and genomic methods that measure an ensemble of millions of cells at high resolution, Xist , its effector proteins, and Xi chromatin modifications appear to accumulate along the entire chromosome ( Clemson et al., 1996 23.

These observations have led to a model in which Xist and its interacting proteins form ribonucleoprotein complexes that are distributed across all X-linked genes to control gene expression. However, super-resolution microscopy has shown that Xist distributes as only 50 to 150 diffraction-limited foci on the Xi in differentiated cells ( Cerase et al., 2014 16. Cerase, A. ∙ Smeets, D. ∙ Tang, Y.A. ... Spatial separation of Xist RNA and polycomb proteins revealed by superresolution microscopy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2015; 112 :E4216-E4225 Google Scholar ). Therefore, these foci cannot regulate gene expression through simultaneous accumulation at each target gene. Thus, even though we know the effector proteins of Xist , the mechanism by which RNA foci exploit these proteins to induce silencing of ∼1,000 genes distributed over 167 million base pairs remains unknown. Here, we addressed this fundamental problem by developing quantitative super-resolution microscopy approaches to interrogate the stoichiometry and spatial relationship of Xist to its effector proteins and target genes during the initiation of XCI. We also performed kinetic measurements and single-particle tracking to explore the dynamics and mobility of Xist and associated proteins.
We discovered that Xist foci are locally confined and that they induce the de novo formation of local protein compartments that encompass Xist -interactors at concentrations exceeding those of the RNA. We refer to these compartments as supramolecular complexes (SMACs). SMACs are dynamic structures formed by transient protein interactions around a slowly exchanging Xist core. The rapid binding and dissociation of most Xist -interacting proteins in SMACs create local protein concentration gradients over broad chromosomal regions. We show that the intrinsically disordered regions of SPEN are essential for its integration into SMACs and for gene silencing, and that Polycomb-mediated chromatin reconfiguration propagates silencing across the X chromosome. In summary, our work reveals that protein crowding enables a limited number of locally confined seeding RNA molecules to silence a much larger number of target genes.

Section: Results

To explore how Xist orchestrates the formation of the Xi, we differentiated female mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), which leads to the induction of Xist expression and initiation of XCI ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). Gene silencing occurs predominantly during the transition from day 2 (D2) to D4, as shown by nascent transcript detection of rapidly ( Rlim ) and slowly ( AtrX and Mecp2 ) silencing genes ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 B). Single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses extended this result to all X-linked genes ( Figures 1 D and S1 C). These data confirm that Xist coating and gene silencing are stepwise processes ( Chaumeil et al., 2006 20. Chaumeil, J. ∙ Le Baccon, P. ∙ Wutz, A. ... A novel role for Xist RNA in the formation of a repressive nuclear compartment into which genes are recruited when silenced Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :2223-2237 Google Scholar ) and establish the D2 to D4 transition as a critical window for dissecting the relationship between Xist , its interacting proteins, and gradual gene silencing. Henceforth, we refer to the D2 X chromosome as the “pre-Xi” and the D4 X chromosome as the “Xi.”
Although architectural differences between the active X chromosome (Xa) and Xi are well known ( Darrow et al., 2016 27. Darrow, E.M. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Dudchenko, O. ... Deletion of DXZ4 on the human inactive X chromosome alters higher-order genome architecture Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E4504-E4512 Google Scholar ; Giorgetti et al., 2016 41. Giorgetti, L. ∙ Lajoie, B.R. ∙ Carter, A.C. ... Structural organization of the inactive X chromosome in the mouse Nature. 2016; 535 :575-579 Google Scholar ; Teller et al., 2011 103. Teller, K. ∙ Illner, D. ∙ Thamm, S. ... A top-down analysis of Xa- and Xi-territories reveals differences of higher order structure at 3 20 Mb genomic length scales Nucleus. 2011; 2 :465-477 Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 112. Wang, C.Y. ∙ Colognori, D. ∙ Sunwoo, H. ... PRC1 collaborates with SMCHD1 to fold the X-chromosome and spread Xist RNA between chromosome compartments Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2950 Google Scholar ), it remains unclear when they arise during XCI. Volume and sphericity measurements upon X-painting showed that the pre-Xi is similar to the Xa and that the Xi at D4 is as compact and spherical as in somatic cells ( Figures 1 E and 1F) ( Teller et al., 2011 103. Teller, K. ∙ Illner, D. ∙ Thamm, S. ... A top-down analysis of Xa- and Xi-territories reveals differences of higher order structure at 3 20 Mb genomic length scales Nucleus. 2011; 2 :465-477 Google Scholar ). Accordingly, assessing the conformation of seven loci on the X through DNA FISH revealed a moderate change of the higher-order configuration in the pre-Xi compared to the Xa and a dramatic difference between the Xa and Xi ( Figures 1 G–1I and S1 D–S1F). Thus, gene silencing is associated with major changes in higher-order chromatin structure and both processes need to be considered to understand the mechanism through which Xist foci form the Xi.
As the number of Xist foci during the initiation of XCI is unknown, we employed super-resolution three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to quantify them during the D2 to D4 transition. To this end, we generated a female mouse ESC line that allows for Xist detection in fixed as well as living cells. Specifically, exploiting the MS2 RNA-MS2 coat protein (MCP) interaction ( Bertrand et al., 1998 6. Bertrand, E. ∙ Chartrand, P. ∙ Schaefer, M. ... Localization of ASH1 mRNA particles in living yeast Mol. Cell. 1998; 2 :437-445 Scopus (1168) Google Scholar ), we tagged the Xist gene on one of the two X chromosomes with 24 MS2-repeats. We then expressed MCP-GFP to label Xist with GFP and confirmed the functionality of the Xist MS2-GFP allele ( Figures 1 J, 1K, and S1 G). Quantitative 3D-SIM analysis of Xist MS2-GFP signals showed that the Xist territory consists of, on average, 74 diffraction-limited foci on the pre-Xi and 60 on the Xi ( Figure 1 L), which we corroborated by RNA FISH ( Figures S1 H and S1I). We also found that the doubling of the X chromosome with DNA replication is accompanied by the doubling of Xist foci from ∼50 in G1 to ∼100 in G2 and that the number of foci correlates with chromosome length ( Figures 1 M and S2 A–S2D). Thus, the variability in the number of Xist foci is largely due to differences in cell cycle across the cell population. Xist foci maintain their integrated density and volume, which is consistent with the constitutive transcription of the Xist locus, suggesting that RNA levels on the Xi are stable throughout XCI ( Figures 1 N, S1 I, S2 E, and S2F). Taken together, these data reveal that XCI is induced by only ∼50 Xist foci and that the pre-Xi to Xi transition occurs without a dramatic change in their number.
To estimate the number of Xist molecules per focus, we transiently expressed nanocages consisting of 60 GFP molecules (cage 60GFP ) ( Hsia et al., 2016 48. Hsia, Y. ∙ Bale, J.B. ∙ Gonen, S. ... Design of a hyperstable 60-subunit protein dodecahedron. [corrected] Nature. 2016; 535 :136-139 Google Scholar ) as internal fluorescence standards in Xist MS2-GFP cells and confirmed similar intensity profiles of cages 60GFP in the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Figures S2 G and S2H). The integrated density of one Xist MS2-GFP focus on the pre-Xi and Xi corresponds to that of one cage 60GFP ( Figures 1 O, S2 I, and S2J). Since ∼30 MCP-GFP molecules bind to 24 MS2-repeats ( Wu et al., 2012 115. Wu, B. ∙ Chao, J.A. ∙ Singer, R.H. Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy enables quantitative imaging of single mRNAs in living cells Biophys. J. 2012; 102 :2936-2944 Google Scholar ), we infer that each focus contains ∼2 Xist molecules. This result is consistent with measured levels of Xist RNA in single differentiating ESCs ( Pacini et al., 2021 79. Pacini, G. ∙ Dunkel, I. ∙ Mages, N. ... Integrated analysis of Xist upregulation and X-chromosome inactivation with single-cell and single-allele resolution Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :3638 Google Scholar ) and estimated numbers of Xist molecules in differentiated cells ( Sunwoo et al., 2015 100. Sunwoo, H. ∙ Wu, J.Y. ∙ Lee, J.T. The Xist RNA-PRC2 complex at 20-nm resolution reveals a low Xist stoichiometry and suggests a hit-and-run mechanism in mouse cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E4216-E4225 Google Scholar ). Thus, only ∼100 Xist molecules orchestrate the initiation and maintenance of XCI.
Hence, how the limited number of Xist foci can silence the ∼1000 X-linked genes remains a puzzle. One possibility is that they regulate target genes via rapid diffusion and transient contacts. To investigate the mobility of Xist foci, we developed conditions for live-cell 3D-SIM of Xist MS2-GFP at D2 and D4. Single-particle tracking for at least 2 min ( Videos S1 and S2 ) showed that Xist foci exhibit restricted motion without fission or fusion ( Figures 2 A and 2B). In 90% of cases, the displacement of each Xist focus over time was less than 200 nm and foci movement was characterized by diffusion in a local confining potential ( Figures 2 C–2E). The confined motion of Xist foci is highly correlated with the motion of chromatin loci ( Chen et al., 2013 21. Chen, B. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Cimini, B.A. ... Dynamic imaging of genomic loci in living human cells by an optimized CRISPR/Cas system Cell. 2013; 155 :1479-1491 Google Scholar ; Nozaki et al., 2017 77. Nozaki, T. ∙ Imai, R. ∙ Tanbo, M. ... Dynamic Organization of Chromatin Domains Revealed by Super-Resolution Live-Cell Imaging Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :282-293.e7 Google Scholar ). We conclude that Xist foci are tethered to chromatin with high affinity, constraining their movement to the local Brownian motion of chromatin. Thus, XCI is initiated through ∼50 sites at which Xist molecules are locally confined.

Xist foci are persistent through time, related to Figure 2 Xist foci from Video S1 after magnification with bilinear pixel size interpolation for clarity.
To investigate if the “wiggling” of Xist foci around their centers occurs within a specific chromatin environment, we introduced a histone H2B-Halo transgene into Xist MS2-GFP ESCs and performed live-cell 3D-SIM ( Figure 2 F; Video S3 ). H2B signals were segmented into intensity levels that correspond to chromatin density classes, with class 1 representing DNA-free interchromatin channels (ICs) and classes 2 to 7 capturing increasing chromatin densities ( Markaki et al., 2012 62. Markaki, Y. ∙ Smeets, D. ∙ Fiedler, S. ... The potential of 3D-FISH and super-resolution structured illumination microscopy for studies of 3D nuclear architecture: 3D structured illumination microscopy of defined chromosomal structures visualized by 3D (immuno)-FISH opens new perspectives for studies of nuclear architecture BioEssays. 2012; 34 :412-426 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 G). Xist foci covered predominantly classes 1 to 3 ( Figure S2 K). Over time, the chromatin densities underlying the footprint of Xist foci never surpassed class 3 and the centroids remained within chromatin class 2, consistent with the linearly and incrementally increasing chromatin density ( Figures 2 H and S2 L). Thus, Xist foci are spatially confined to the periphery of chromatin domains and stably maintain their positions relative to chromatin.

Xist foci are locally confined at chromatin borders facing the IC space, related to Figure 2 Live-cell 3D-SIM imaging of Xist MS2-GFP (green) and H2B-Halo JF647 (magenta) at D4 of differentiation. Projections of optical stacks acquired through time are shown.
In agreement with these observations, RNA antisense purification (RAP) of Xist followed by DNA sequencing of associated chromatin ( Engreitz et al., 2013 34. Engreitz, J.M. ∙ Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ McDonel, P. ... The Xist lncRNA exploits three-dimensional genome architecture to spread across the X chromosome Science. 2013; 341 :1237973 Google Scholar ) showed that Xist localizes to gene-rich, open chromatin regions of the A-compartment ( Figure 2 I). We identified 65 and 63 highly overlapping peaks of Xist enrichment on the pre-Xi and Xi, respectively ( Figures 2 J and S2 M), similar to the number of foci detected by 3D-SIM. These peaks cover broad genomic regions of 1–5 megabases ( Figure S2 N), indicating variability in Xist foci locations between cells. Xist peaks in the Xi are broader than those in the pre-Xi despite the overall similar distributions (Pearson’s correlation r = 0.83) ( Figures 2 I, 2J, and S2 N), suggesting that the chromatin contacts of Xist foci change over time due to chromatin compaction.
To explore how Xist effector proteins accumulate relative to ∼50 locally confined Xist foci, we set out to quantify, at sub-diffraction resolution, their spatial relationship to Xist and to each other. We initially focused on SPEN, PCGF5, CELF1, and CIZ1, four proteins that bind to distinct repeat sequences of Xist and have different roles in XCI ( Figure 3 A) ( Loda and Heard, 2019 61. Loda, A. ∙ Heard, E. Xist RNA in action: Past, present, and future PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1008333 Google Scholar ). SPEN binds the A-repeat of Xist and activates HDAC3 on chromatin to induce gene silencing ( Chu et al., 2015 22. Chu, C. ∙ Zhang, Q.C. ∙ da Rocha, S.T. ...

The Xist lncRNA interacts directly with SHARP to silence transcription through HDAC3 Nature. 2015; 521 :232-236 Google Scholar ). The non-canonical PRC1 subunit PCGF5 is recruited to the Xi via the B-repeat and supports silencing of some X-linked genes ( Almeida et al., 2017 1. Almeida, M. ∙ Pintacuda, G. ∙ Masui, O. ...

CELF1 and CIZ1 bind to the E-repeat and restrict Xist to the Xi ( Pandya-Jones et al., 2020 80. Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ Markaki, Y. ∙ Serizay, J. ...

To interrogate the localization of Xist -interactors, we introduced Halo-tagged transgenes into Xist MS2-GFP cells, allowing imaging of an antibody-stained and a stably expressed Halo-fusion protein together with Xist by multispectral 3D-SIM. We observed the formation of diffraction-limited protein assemblies in proximity to Xist foci in both the pre-Xi and Xi that are larger than nuclear accumulations ( Figures 3 B, S3 A, and S3B). To quantitatively define these distributions, we extracted nucleus-wide spatial coordinates of thousands of segmented diffraction-limited protein particles ( Figures S3 C–S3E). We paired protein to Xist foci and measured nearest neighbor distances between pairs of different interactors associated with the same Xist focus ( Figure 3 C) or protein pairs located in the remainder of the nucleus. For all pairs, protein foci are on average within ∼150–200 nm of each other when associated with Xist , both on the pre-Xi and Xi, and are separated by >350 nm in the rest of the nucleus ( Figure 3 D). Thus, Xist foci induce the de novo formation of unique protein complexes that locally concentrate effector proteins more than elsewhere in the nucleus. The density of SPEN, CELF1, PCGF5, and CIZ1 particles is significantly higher in the pre-Xi and Xi than in the nucleus, consistent with their decreased nearest and average distances in the X-territory ( Figures 3 E, S4 A, and S4B). Furthermore, their concentration increases from the pre-Xi to the Xi, along with the observed chromatin compaction. Hence, large multi-protein assemblies that are not typically found outside the Xi form around Xist foci. In this way, Xist recruitment increases the concentration of proteins within the forming Xi. We refer to the Xist -nucleated proteinaceous nanostructures as supramolecular complexes (SMACs). We also observed their formation when XCI is ectopically induced on an autosome ( Figure S3 F) consistent with SMACs being a fundamental feature of the XCI process.
To explore whether integration into SMACs is the main mechanism of protein recruitment in the Xi, we probed the distribution of additional XCI effectors ( Figure S4 C), including the PRC1 subunit RYBP ( Tavares et al., 2012 102. Tavares, L. ∙ Dimitrova, E. ∙ Oxley, D. ... RYBP-PRC1 complexes mediate H2A ubiquitylation at polycomb target sites independently of PRC2 and H3K27me3 Cell. 2012; 148 :664-678 Google Scholar ); the EZH2 subunit of PRC2 ( Plath et al., 2003 84. Plath, K. ∙ Fang, J. ∙ Mlynarczyk-Evans, S.K. ... Role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in X inactivation Science. 2003; 300 :131-135 Google Scholar ; Silva et al., 2003 95.

Cell. 2003; 4 :481-495 Google Scholar ); hnRNP-K, which binds the Xist B-repeat to recruit PCGF5 ( Pintacuda et al., 2017 82. Pintacuda, G. ∙ Wei, G. ∙ Roustan, C. ... hnRNPK Recruits PCGF3/5-PRC1 to the Xist RNA B-Repeat to Establish Polycomb-Mediated Chromosomal Silencing Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :955-969.e10 Google Scholar ); PTBP1 and MATR3, which regulate Xist localization with CELF1 ( Pandya-Jones et al., 2020 80. Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ Markaki, Y. ∙ Serizay, J. ... A protein assembly mediates Xist localization and gene silencing Nature. 2020; 587 :145-151 Google Scholar ). For all examined proteins, we detected a particle associated with a Xist focus in a near 1:1 ratio and nearest neighbor measurements revealed their presence within a 200 nm zone from the centroid of Xist , significantly more proximal than randomized protein populations ( Figures 3 F and S4 D; Table S1 ). These data corroborate the de novo formation of a multi-protein macromolecular cloud around Xist foci at the onset of XCI ( Figure 3 G).
We next quantified the concentration of proteins in SMACs in relation to nuclear accumulations ( Figures 3 H and S4 E). Integrated density and particle volume measurements showed that the levels of CIZ1, CELF1, SPEN, PCGF5, EZH2, and RYBP in SMACs significantly exceed those in nuclear assemblies. Protein accumulation in SMACs varies moderately across the pre-Xi to Xi transition. CIZ1 levels remain relatively stable; PCGF5, EZH2, and RYBP levels follow nuclear changes; CELF1 levels decrease; and SPEN levels dramatically increase. Thus, gene silencing is correlated with more SPEN molecules in SMACs. MATR3, PTBP1, and hnRNP-K exhibit baseline concentrations in SMACs, suggesting that their recruitment, rather than increased accumulation is essential in XCI.
To estimate numbers of protein molecules incorporated into SMACs, we focused on the critical silencing factor SPEN. We exploited our cage 60GFP -standard approach and a cell line in which endogenously encoded SPEN is GFP-tagged and Xist can be induced with doxycycline (dox) ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 I). Compared to developmentally induced XCI, dox-induction results in a larger number of Xist foci, yet yields similar levels of SPEN in SMACs. Moreover, before plateauing, SPEN-SMAC levels increase between 6 and 18 h of dox-addition as seen for the pre-Xi to Xi transition ( Figures S4 F and S4G). This result is consistent with the observation that SPEN increases over the Xi-territory across time upon dox-induction of Xist ( Jachowicz et al., 2021 51. Jachowicz, J.W. ∙ Strehle, M. ∙ Banerjee, A.K. ... Xist spatially amplifies SHARP recruitment to balance chromosome-wide silencing and specificity to the X chromosome bioRxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ). Comparing the integrated density of SPEN-GFP to that of cage 60GFP , we infer that there are up to 35 SPEN molecules per SMAC ( Figure 3 J). This finding suggests that each complex may consist of hundreds to thousands of protein molecules and that many effector proteins likely are significantly enriched relative to the number of RNA molecules ( Figure 3 G).
To explore the kinetic behavior of SMAC protein components, we introduced Halo or mCherry-tagged SPEN, PCGF5, CIZ1, CELF1, or PTBP1 fusions into Xist MS2-GFP ESCs and performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) over the Xist MS2-GFP -demarcated Xi-territory and other same-size nuclear regions. We also examined Xist RNA dynamics after confirming that no recovery of the Xist MS2-GFP signals occurred in the absence of transcription ( Figures S5 A–S5E). We observed a slow exchange of photobleached Xist MS2-GFP in the Xi ( Figure 4 A), comparable to that of ectopically expressed Xist ( Ng et al., 2011 76. Ng, K. ∙ Daigle, N. ∙ Bancaud, A. ... A system for imaging the regulatory noncoding Xist RNA in living mouse embryonic stem cells Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22 :2634-2645 Google Scholar ). A single-exponential kinetic model provided the best fit to the measured FRAP curve and inferred a slow dissociation rate (0.05/min) and an average lifetime of ∼22 min. This result is consistent with a single type of high-affinity interaction between Xist and chromatin ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Similar to Xist , CIZ1 has a ∼19 min recovery time in the Xi, which is much longer than that of all other interrogated proteins ( Figures 4 D–F). The tight kinetic and spatial relationship between Xist and CIZ1 ( Figures 3 F and 4 D; Video S4 ) suggests that CIZ1 and Xist molecules form a relatively stable core within a SMAC.

Xist and CIZ1 exhibit a highly correlated motion in the Xi-territory, related to Figure 4 Live-cell 3D-SIM imaging of Xist MS2-GFP (green) and CIZ1-Halo JF647 (magenta) at D4 of differentiation. Projections of optical stacks acquired through time are shown.
Kinetic modeling of the SPEN, PCGF5, CELF1, and PTBP1 FRAP curves yielded faster exchange rates than CIZ1 and Xist and two effective types of binding sites ( Figures 4 F, 4G, and S5 D–S5F). Using two-exponential fits, we inferred parameters for the short-lived ( f 1 ) and long-lived ( f 2 ) bound fractions within and outside of the Xi. For each protein, the rapid binding events occurred within seconds, while slow dissociation required several minutes ( Figures 4 G and S5 G). SPEN was the most dynamic among the examined proteins. Recruitment by Xist extended the residence time of these proteins compared to that in the nucleus, indicating that the Xi forms a unique nuclear compartment within which proteins exhibit distinct kinetic behaviors ( Figure 4 G). The kinetic assays indicate that Xist effector proteins with short residence times bind to the slowly exchanging Xist -CIZ1 core. Thus, SMACs are rapidly exchanging dynamic complexes that form local, high-affinity concentration platforms. Accordingly, examination of SPEN and PCGF5 populations in the Xi, outside SMACs, revealed higher protein concentrations than in nuclear accumulations, demonstrating that recruitment to SMACs leads to enrichment of constituent proteins across extended local neighborhoods in the X-territory ( Figures 4 H and S5 H–S5K).
The formation of SMACs is consistent with a requirement for extensive protein-protein interactions ( Figure 3 G). SPEN contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which typically mediate weak, multivalent interactions ( Banani et al., 2017 2. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Google Scholar ; Cerase et al., 2019 17. Cerase, A. ∙ Armaos, A. ∙ Neumayer, C. ...

Atomic-level characterization of disordered protein ensembles Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17 :3-14 Google Scholar ; Uversky, 2015 106. Uversky, V.N. The multifaceted roles of intrinsic disorder in protein complexes FEBS Lett. 2015; 589 :2498-2506 Google Scholar ). We homozygously deleted the IDRs within the endogenous SPEN alleles in female ESCs in which SPEN is tagged with GFP ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ) and showed that ΔIDR SPEN expression did not disrupt the formation of the Xist cloud ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S6 A, and S6B). Deletion of the IDRs does not interfere with the binding of the protein to Xist but eliminates the increased SPEN levels in SMACs such that ΔIDR SPEN levels in the pre-Xi and Xi are close to those of the wild-type (WT) protein within the nucleus ( Figures 5 B and 5C). We conclude that the accumulation of SPEN in SMACs is driven exclusively by their IDRs. A recent study similarly showed that exogenous expression of SPEN lacking its IDRs impacts SPEN localization over the Xi-territory upon dox induction of Xist without affecting Xist binding ( Jachowicz et al., 2021 51. Jachowicz, J.W. ∙ Strehle, M. ∙ Banerjee, A.K. ... Xist spatially amplifies SHARP recruitment to balance chromosome-wide silencing and specificity to the X chromosome bioRxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ). Moreover, binding to Xist through its RNA binding (RRM) domains is required for the IDR-mediated concentration of SPEN into SMACs ( Figures S6 C–S6E). FRAP experiments showed that the deletion of the IDRs or RRMs abolishes the characteristic Xi-immobile fraction of SPEN and dramatically alters residence times, with ΔIDR SPEN exhibiting very long unbinding times in both the Xi and nuclear fractions, possibly due to the tight binding to the RNA through the RRMs ( Figures S6 F–S6H). Therefore, the IDRs of SPEN are also critical for creating a dynamic protein assembly ( Figure 5 K).
The SPOC domain of SPEN is essential for silencing ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ), but whether the crowding of SPEN is necessary for the functionality of SPOC is unknown. RNA FISH for nascent transcription of five X-linked genes revealed a striking silencing defect when IDR-mediated crowding was ablated, similar to the lack of silencing caused by the deletion of SPOC ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 D and 5E). This is consistent with a recent report that showed, that the IDRs of SPEN are required for transcriptional silencing of four X-linked genes upon dox-induction of Xist , based on RNA FISH ( Jachowicz et al., 2021 51. Jachowicz, J.W. ∙ Strehle, M. ∙ Banerjee, A.K. ... Xist spatially amplifies SHARP recruitment to balance chromosome-wide silencing and specificity to the X chromosome bioRxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ). To explore if the loss of gene silencing by ΔIDR SPEN extends to the entire X chromosome, we performed scRNA-seq before and 24 h after Xist induction in ΔIDR-, ΔSPOC-, and WT SPEN-expressing cells. Although X-linked gene repression was observed in WT cells, both ΔIDR- and ΔSPOC SPEN-expressing cells displayed a dramatic X chromosome-wide loss of gene silencing, affecting both rapidly and slowly silencing genes ( Barros de Andrade E. Sousa et al., 2019 3. Barros de Andrade E. Sousa, L. ∙ Jonkers, I. ∙ Syx, L. ... Kinetics of Xist -induced gene silencing can be predicted from combinations of epigenetic and genomic features Genome Res. 2019; 29 :1087-1099 Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Next, we constitutively expressed Halo-tagged ΔIDR or full-length (FL) SPEN as rescue constructs in ESCs in which the endogenously encoded SPEN is fused to the AID degron tag and can be depleted by addition of auxin ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Bulk RNA-seq showed that FL but not ΔIDR SPEN can rescue X-linked gene silencing ( Figure 5 J). Interestingly, when only SPOC is tightly tethered to Xist ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ), X-linked genes are inefficiently silenced ( Figures S6 I–S6K), consistent with a dynamic SPEN protein being required for XCI. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the concentration of SPEN in SMACs and its rapid kinetic behavior, both mediated by the IDRs, are required for the protein to exert its silencing function through the SPOC domain ( Figure 5 K).
Non-canonical PRC1 induces the recruitment of canonical PRC1 and downstream accumulation of PRC2 ( Brockdorff, 2017 13. Brockdorff, N. Polycomb complexes in X chromosome inactivation Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 372 :20170021 Google Scholar ) and is implicated in the silencing of a subset of X-linked genes ( Bousard et al., 2019 9.

Zylicz, J.J. ∙ Bousard, A. ∙ Zumer, K. ... The Implication of Early Chromatin Changes in X Chromosome Inactivation Cell. 2019; 176 :182-197.e23 Google Scholar ). Yet, PRC1 spreads into genes only after silencing has occurred ( Zylicz et al., 2019 124. Zylicz, J.J. ∙ Bousard, A. ∙ Zumer, K. ... The Implication of Early Chromatin Changes in X Chromosome Inactivation Cell. 2019; 176 :182-197.e23 Google Scholar ), raising the question of how it contributes to XCI. Since PRC1 is critical for chromatin compaction in various developmental contexts ( Boyle et al., 2020 10. Boyle, S. ∙ Flyamer, I.M. ∙ Williamson, I. ... A central role for canonical PRC1 in shaping the 3D nuclear landscape Genes Dev. 2020; 34 :931-949 Google Scholar ; Francis et al., 2004 37. Francis, N.J. ∙ Kingston, R.E. ∙ Woodcock, C.L.

Chromatin folding and nuclear architecture: PRC1 function in 3D Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2019; 55 :82-90 Google Scholar ), we explored whether the B-repeat is required for the structural reorganization of the Xi.
We perturbed PRC1 recruitment to the X by heterozygously deleting the B-repeat (ΔB- Xist ) on the MS2-tagged 129 Xist allele in female ESCs derived from a 129 × castaneous (Cas) cross and compared the compaction of the Xi Cas formed by FL- Xist to the Xi 129 induced by ΔB- Xist ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Deletion of the B-repeat results in less compacted pre-Xi and Xi territories, larger distances between Xist foci and an expansion of the Xist cluster ( Figures 6 B–6C and S7 A–S7C). Accordingly, the density of SPEN-decorated SMACs is far lower in the ΔΒ-Xi than in the WT-Xi, although the concentration of SPEN in their respective SMACs is similar ( Figures S7 D and S7E). Together, these results uncover a role of the B-repeat, and in turn of PRC1 and its downstream effectors, in driving the compaction of the X chromosome and densification of SMACs during XCI initiation.
To explore if X-linked gene-silencing dynamics are altered in the absence of compaction, we performed scRNA-seq at D2 and D4. Upon deletion of the B-repeat, silencing is more impaired on the Xi than on the pre-Xi ( Figure 6 E). The silencing defect is strongest for slowly silencing genes ( Figures 6 F–6H). These results extend to cells lacking SMCHD1 that controls the compartmentalization of the Xi and is recruited to the Xi by PRC1 ( Jansz et al., 2018 52. Jansz, N. ∙ Nesterova, T. ∙ Keniry, A. ... Smchd1 Targeting to the Inactive X Is Dependent on the Xist-HnrnpK-PRC1 Pathway Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :1912-1923.e9 Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 112. Wang, C.Y. ∙ Colognori, D. ∙ Sunwoo, H. ... PRC1 collaborates with SMCHD1 to fold the X-chromosome and spread Xist RNA between chromosome compartments Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2950 Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 E). Thus, compaction by PRC1 and SMCHD1 and the further clustering of the Xist -SMACs allows SPEN to act on all genes.
We next explored how genes with different silencing kinetics, i.e., rapidly (early) and slowly (late) silencing genes, localize relative to Xist foci. To determine these spatial relationships, we applied multiple distance metrics to 20 simultaneously detected early or late genes distributed across the entire X chromosome, their nascent transcripts, and Xist by RNA/DNA FISH and 3D-SIM ( Figures 7 A–7D).
We first monitored the distribution of early and late gene loci on the Xa relative to the Xist transcription locus by exploiting the detection of Tsix RNA as a proxy for the X-inactivation center (Xic) where the Xist gene is located ( Plath et al., 2002 83. Plath, K. ∙ Mlynarczyk-Evans, S. ∙ Nusinow, D.A. ... Xist RNA and the mechanism of X chromosome inactivation Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36 :233-278 Google Scholar ). This analysis showed that early genes are closer to the Xist locus than late genes ( Figures 7 C and 7E). Accordingly, upon differentiation, early genes are closer to individual Xist foci or to the center of the entire Xist cluster than late genes, which is more pronounced on the pre-Xi ( Figures 7 F and S7 G). Thus, genomic regions containing early genes are spatially more proximal to the Xist locus at the onset of XCI and more likely to be populated by the Xist cluster. Intriguingly, there is no significant difference in the nearest distance of active and silenced genes to Xist foci within each group, yet active genes tend to be more distal to the center of the Xist foci cluster ( Figures 7 G and S7 H). This finding is consistent with late genes being further away from the Xist cluster in the pre-Xi.
Chromosomal compaction significantly decreases the distances of both early and late genes to Xist foci in the pre-Xi to Xi transition, with a higher impact on late genes, which also exhibit the most dramatic repositioning ( Figures 7 F and 7H). The result of the conformational change is that early and late genes congregate and move closer to the center of the Xist cluster ( Figures 7 C and S7 G). Consequently, the same number of Xist foci can progressively silence more genes. The gradual gene silencing during the XCI process can therefore be explained by the spatial organization and reconfiguration of the X chromosome that dictate the relationship of genes to the Xist cluster.
Finally, we explored how loss of compaction affects the organization of genes relative to Xist in cells expressing ΔB- Xist . All genes on the ΔB-Xi, regardless of their silencing kinetics, are at larger distances from the centroid of the Xist cluster and to each other, and the overall distances between early and late genes are enlarged compared to WT-Xi ( Figures 7 I–7L). However, nearest neighbor measurements between Xist foci and early or late genes revealed no significant difference for the ΔB and WT Xi, suggesting that Xist foci localize similarly to target regions ( Figure 7 M). These findings indicate that the lack in compaction affects the reorganization of genes, which results in poor clustering of SMACs and inefficient silencing, particularly of late genes.

Section: Discussion

XCI is a powerful model for interrogating how lncRNA molecules can establish a functional nuclear compartment. Since its discovery, it has been thought that Xist progressively spreads on chromatin to associate with all target genes. This view was refined by the observation that Xist first localizes to sites in close spatial proximity to its transcription locus and then spreads chromosome wide ( Engreitz et al., 2013 34. Engreitz, J.M. ∙ Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ McDonel, P. ... The Xist lncRNA exploits three-dimensional genome architecture to spread across the X chromosome Science. 2013; 341 :1237973 Google Scholar ). Owing to the focal accumulation of Xist revealed by super-resolution microscopy studies, it was proposed that the RNA and interacting proteins form ribonucleoprotein complexes that sample genes along the chromosome through a “hit-and-run” model ( Sunwoo et al., 2015 100. Sunwoo, H. ∙ Wu, J.Y. ∙ Lee, J.T. The Xist RNA-PRC2 complex at 20-nm resolution reveals a low Xist stoichiometry and suggests a hit-and-run mechanism in mouse cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :E4216-E4225 Google Scholar ). Our study shows that Xist foci are instead stably bound to chromatin and that they induce the de novo formation of SMACs. Each Xist -SMAC accumulates ∼35 copies of the ∼400 KDa protein SPEN. A comparison with other protein levels in SMACs suggests that other Xist effectors likely concentrate to much higher levels. The formation of SMACs induces a phase transition in the Xi, as SMACs surrounding stably bound Xist molecules create a sharp increase in protein density at the boundary of the Xi. Whether SMACs exhibit features of liquid-liquid phase separation and whether the progressive coalescence of chromatin regions induces polymer-polymer phase separation ( Frank and Rippe, 2020 38. Frank, L. ∙ Rippe, K. Repetitive RNAs as Regulators of Chromatin-Associated Subcompartment Formation by Phase Separation J. Mol. Biol. 2020; 432 :4270-4286 Google Scholar ) remains to be determined.
Our results suggest that different binding environments in SMACs allow for both topological retention of proteins as well as their rapid exchange. IDRs are critical for the dynamic supramolecular aggregation of SPEN in SMACs, which is necessary for its catalytic domain SPOC to exert gene silencing. This finding is consistent with reports that catalytic rates of IDR-containing DNA modifying enzymes increase with crowding ( Kuznetsova et al., 2014 58. Kuznetsova, I.M. ∙ Turoverov, K.K. ∙ Uversky, V.N. What macromolecular crowding can do to a protein Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014; 15 :23090-23140 Google Scholar ; Zimmerman and Pheiffer, 1983 123. Zimmerman, S.B. ∙ Pheiffer, B.H. Macromolecular crowding allows blunt-end ligation by DNA ligases from rat liver or Escherichia coli Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1983; 80 :5852-5856 Google Scholar ). Many Xist -interacting proteins contain IDRs and have the propensity to self-aggregate ( Cerase et al., 2019 17. Cerase, A. ∙ Armaos, A. ∙ Neumayer, C. ... Phase separation drives X-chromosome inactivation: a hypothesis Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :331-334 Google Scholar ; Pandya-Jones et al., 2020 80. Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ Markaki, Y. ∙ Serizay, J. ... A protein assembly mediates Xist localization and gene silencing Nature. 2020; 587 :145-151 Google Scholar ). Whether the IDRs of SPEN are involved solely in homotypic interactions and how IDRs of other Xist -interactors contribute to the formation and function of SMACs remain open questions. Interestingly, the binding to Xist is required for the IDR-dependent integration of SPEN into SMACs and may impart specificity to protein interactions within the Xi. RNA binding may induce folding of unstructured IDRs and enable “entry” into SMACs, consistent with observations for other IDR-containing proteins ( Uversky, 2015 106. Uversky, V.N. The multifaceted roles of intrinsic disorder in protein complexes FEBS Lett. 2015; 589 :2498-2506 Google Scholar ).
Our work yields a revised model of how Xist establishes the Xi compartment and orchestrates gradual transcriptional silencing ( Figure 7 N). Through expression, diffusion, sequestration, and degradation (see section “Expression-diffusion-degradation model for Xist confinement” in Methods S1 ), two Xist transcripts become localized and tightly bound to chromatin, seeding SMACs at 50 regions that are proximal to the Xist locus and enriched for rapidly silencing genes. By establishing high local concentrations of transiently binding effector proteins in SMACs, Xist induces gradients of silencing proteins, most importantly of SPEN, that can act at genomic locations on the X without their continuous association with Xist . This process initiates silencing on the pre-Xi. The high concentration of PRC1 and likely other architectural regulators brought about by SMACs progressively induces higher-order chromatin changes and compaction. Compaction promotes the overall densification of genes under the SMACs cluster, enabling a constant number of SMACs to gain access to an increasing number of genes. Consequently, a higher concentration of SPEN is present in the vicinity of more genes and silencing expands across the entire X. However, the presence of a SMAC per se is not sufficient to induce effective silencing as genomic regions that are poorly crowded by SMACs silence less efficiently. By showing that SMAC formation and chromatin reconfiguration are interdependent mechanisms to achieve robust gene silencing, our model fills the knowledge gap of how different repressive pathways cooperate in XCI.
Phase separation has recently emerged as a much-debated mechanism in the field of gene regulation ( McSwiggen et al., 2019 66. McSwiggen, D.T. ∙ Mir, M. ∙ Darzacq, X. ... Evaluating phase separation in live cells: diagnosis, caveats, and functional consequences Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :1619-1634 Google Scholar ). Yet, the functional role of condensates in gene regulation remains largely undefined. Macromolecular crowding as the mode of heterochromatin formation, described here, expands transcriptional control beyond the seeding molecule. This mechanism may be particularly important for gene regulatory RNAs, typically expressed at low numbers relative to their targets ( Cabili et al., 2015 15. Cabili, M.N. ∙ Dunagin, M.C. ∙ McClanahan, P.D. ... Localization and abundance analysis of human lncRNAs at single-cell and single-molecule resolution Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :20 Google Scholar ; Derrien et al., 2012 29. Derrien, T. ∙ Johnson, R. ∙ Bussotti, G. ... The GENCODE v7 catalog of human long noncoding RNAs: analysis of their gene structure, evolution, and expression Genome Res. 2012; 22 :1775-1789 Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, other lncRNAs have also been found to induce spreading of Polycomb complexes ( Schertzer et al., 2019 93. Schertzer, M.D. ∙ Braceros, K.C.A. ∙ Starmer, J. ... lncRNA-Induced Spread of Polycomb Controlled by Genome Architecture, RNA Abundance, and CpG Island DNA Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :523-537.e10 Google Scholar ), suggesting that a common mechanism in the organization of an efficient repressive nuclear compartment may involve enzymes that induce transcriptional repression together with regulators of chromatin architecture.
In this study, we applied super-resolution imaging in combination with kinetic modeling, genomic approaches, and functional perturbations to investigate fundamental principles of RNA-seeded nuclear compartmentalization. While multi-spectral quantitative super-resolution imaging allowed us to explore the spatial relationships of RNA, DNA, and protein in individual cells, it is subject to physical limitations. With 3D-SIM, we can resolve the distribution of XCI effectors down to few hundreds of kb along the genome that does not allow us to examine enrichment at specific genes, which would require even higher resolution ( Xie and Liu, 2021 118. Xie, L. ∙ Liu, Z. Single-cell imaging of genome organization and dynamics Mol. Syst. Biol. 2021; 17 :e9653 Google Scholar ). Furthermore, due to the limited number of individual fluorophores that can be employed, it is not possible to simultaneously detect several SMAC proteins Xist , genes, and gene transcripts to directly determine what changes trigger the switch from an active to a repressed state. Additionally, fixation, permeabilization, and heat-denaturation applied in FISH or immunodetection experiments solubilize a considerable amount of protein, thus, the protein levels in SMACs is likely underestimated. Finally, although a sharp boundary needs to be determined in segmentation-based image analysis, as employed in our study, SMACs are dynamic, formed by rapidly exchanging proteins and likely do not adopt defined, but rather graded, distributed structures. Despite these limitations, super-resolution microscopy was critical for disentangling the processes of gene silencing and chromatin reconfiguration and allowed us to distinguish Xist from its protein interactors as functionally distinct entities in the Xi space.

Female mouse polymorphic 129S4/SvJae / castaneus F1 2-1 ESCs ( Panning et al., 1997 81. Panning, B. ∙ Dausman, J. ∙ Jaenisch, R. X chromosome inactivation is mediated by Xist RNA stabilization Cell. 1997; 90 :907-916 Google Scholar ) and its engineered derivatives were grown on 0.5% gelatin-coated flasks seeded with irradiated DR4 feeders (obtained from day 14.5 embryos with appropriate animal protocols in place). Cultures were maintained in mouse ESC medium containing knockout medium DMEM (Life Technologies), 15% FBS (Omega), 2mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 1x NEAA (Life Technologies), 0.1mM β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin (Life Technologies), and 1000U/mL mouse LIF (homemade) in 5% CO2, 37°C incubators.
Epiblast-like (EpiLC) differentiation was performed as described ( Hayashi and Saitou, 2013 46. Hayashi, K. ∙ Saitou, M. Generation of eggs from mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1513-1524 Google Scholar ). Briefly, prior to induction of EpiLC differentiation cells were adjusted for 3 passages to feeder-free conditions in the presence of 1000U/mL LIF and two inhibitors, CHIR99021 (3 μM) and PD0325901 (0.4 μM) (2i+LIF) in serum-free N2B27 medium containing 1x N2 supplement and 1x B27 supplement (Thermo Fischer), 2mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 1x NEAA (Life Technologies), 0.1mM β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 0.5 x Penicillin/Streptomycin (Life Technologies). To induce differentiation, cells were dissociated and seeded at a density of 2 × 10 5 cells/mL in N2B27 media containing 20 ng/mL Activin A and 12 ng/mL bFGF on geltrex-coated flasks or coverslips. For experiments extending beyond day 4 of differentiation, we applied a protocol previously described in ( Ying and Smith, 2003 119. Ying, Q.L. ∙ Smith, A.G. Defined conditions for neural commitment and differentiation Methods Enzymol. 2003; 365 :327-341 Google Scholar ). Briefly, at day 4 of differentiation, EpiLCs were dissociated with accutase and seeded on geltrex-coated coverslips at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells/cm 2 . Cells were then grown in N2B27 media supplemented with EGF and FGF (10 ng/mL each), on geltrex-coated coverslips for 4 more days (day 8 of differentiation). At this developmental stage, cells have lost Tsix expression as observed in Figure 1 B. Media was exchanged daily.
TX1072, female polymorphic B6/castaneus mouse ESCs lines, carrying a tetO-promoter driving the endogenous Xist allele on the B6 X chromosome (B6 tetO-Xist Cas WT-Xist ), further modified by a homozygous insertion of the GFP or Halo tag in the endogenous Spen loci ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ) or the deletion of the SPOC domain in the endogenous locus (ΔSPOC-SPEN-GFP) ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ), as well as derivative cell lines generated in this study carrying ΔIDR-SPEN-GFP or Rosa26 knockins, were grown on gelatin-coated flasks in feeder-free conditions (2i+LIF in mouse ESC medium) and EpiLC differentiation was performed as described for the F1 2-1 ESCs. When induction of XCI was performed from the tetO- Xist , 0.5 μg/mL doxycycline were added to ESC media without 2i+LIF for 24 h. Similarly, male tetO- Xist ESCs were grown on gelatin-coated flasks in feeder-free conditions and induction of Xist expression was performed with addition of 0.5 μg/mL doxycycline in ESC media for 18 to 24 h.
For auxin-mediated depletion experiments of the TX1072 ESCs expressing SPEN-AID-GFP ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ) and Rosa26 SPEN rescue knockins, auxin was added to 2i+LIF ESC medium at 500 μM for 12 h. Following, cells were dissociated by trypsinization and seeded in ESC medium without 2i+LIF including 500 μM auxin and 0.5 μg/mL doxycycline for 24 h to induce Xist expression.
C127 cells were purchased from ATCC and human fibroblasts containing abnormal X-chromosomes (GM3827, GM00735, GM06960, GM07213) were obtained from Coriell Institute. These cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies), 15% FBS (Omega), 2mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin (Life Technologies).
Plasmids containing the 24xMS2 repeats (#31865) and MS2-Coat-Protein-GFP (MCP-GFP) coding sequence (#27121) were obtained from Addgene. The pBglII5k plasmid ( Jonkers et al., 2008 54. Jonkers, I. ∙ Monkhorst, K. ∙ Rentmeester, E. ... Xist RNA is confined to the nuclear territory of the silenced X chromosome throughout the cell cycle Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28 :5583-5594 Google Scholar ) was used for targeting the 24xMS2 repeats into Xist and contains homology arms for insertion into exon 7 of Xist, downstream of the E-repeat sequence, and a floxed neomycin resistance cassette. The 24xMS2 repeats were excised from plasmid #31865 by restriction digest with BglII and BamHI and inserted into the pBglII5k plasmid by Infusion cloning, yielding the pBglII5k-24xMS2 plasmid (which replaces the 16xMS2 repeat array originally contained in the pBglII5k plasmid). The coding region for MCP-GFP was amplified by PCR from plasmid #27121 and introduced under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (tetO) into the pBS31 plasmid (pgkATGfrt) ( Beard et al., 2006 4. Beard, C. ∙ Hochedlinger, K. ∙ Plath, K. ... Efficient method to generate single-copy transgenic mice by site-specific integration in embryonic stem cells Genesis. 2006; 44 :23-28 Google Scholar ) by Infusion cloning, yielding pBS31-MCP-GFP. A reverse tetracycline TransActivator (rtTA3) cassette containing the PGK promoter and a BGH polyA element was amplified by PCR from the MXS_PGK::rtTA3-bGHpA plasmid ( Addgene, #62446) and introduced into the unique AscI site of pBS31-MCP-GFP, downstream of the tetO-MCP-GFP-polyA insert, by Infusion cloning, resulting in the pBS31-MCP-GFP-rtTA3 plasmid. For deletion of the B-repeat of Xist the p13-5-Xist-Bdel plasmid was constructed from PCR-amplified 5′ and 3′ homology regions obtained from the PCV-Xist-PA plasmid and a loxP-flanked hygroTK cassette that replaces the B-repeat sequence (chrX: 103480156-103480430, mm10), inserted into a PBS-KS (+) plasmid.
For the integration of transgenes expressing various mCherry or Halo protein fusions under the control of the endogenous Rosa26 promoter in Xist MS2-GFP ESCs, we employed a parent plasmid harboring homology arms for targeting the Rosa26 locus and a loxP-flanked puromycin cassette for antibiotic selection (R26-SA-EGFP-puro). A splice-acceptor (SA) sequence and a splice-donor (SD) coding sequence were synthesized (Genewiz) and inserted into the R26-SA-EGFP-puro plasmid after MluI/MfeI restriction digest to remove the GFP, by Infusion reaction. The resulting pYM215-R26-SA/SD-puro plasmid was used as the parent plasmid for insertion of all protein fusions in three-piece Infusion reactions. The coding sequence for CIZ1 was amplified from the donor plasmid pBS32-MCP-CIZ1( Pandya-Jones et al., 2020 80. Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ Markaki, Y. ∙ Serizay, J. ... A protein assembly mediates Xist localization and gene silencing Nature. 2020; 587 :145-151 Google Scholar ). Coding sequences for histone H2B and mCherry were amplified from a H2B-mCherry plasmid (Addgene, #20972) and the Halo cDNA was obtained from the Halo-EasyFusion plasmid (Addgene, #112852). The coding sequences for PTBP1, PCGF5, and CELF1 were synthesized (Genewiz).
To generate the Spen-FL-Halo, Spen-ΔRRM-Halo and Spen-ΔIDR-Halo plasmids, introduced into Xist MS2-GFP ESCs or TX1072 ESCs, the full-length Spen Entry Clone (Sp22) was modified using Polymerase Incomplete Primer Extension-based mutagenesis with primers designed to delete amino acids 639-3460 or 1-591, respectively. Sp22 and the Spen-ΔIDR or Spen-ΔRRM entry clones, respectively, were inserted into the PyPP-CAG-Halo-V5-IRES-Puro destination vector using Gateway LR Recombination, generating PyPP-CAG-Halo-full-length-Spen-V5, PyPP-CAG-Halo-Spen-ΔIDR-V5 and PyPP-CAG-Halo-Spen-ΔRRM-V5, respectively, also containing an IRES-puromycin resistance cassette for selection. These plasmids enable constitutive expression of Spen variants with an N-terminal Halo tag and a C-terminal V5 tag and contain a polyoma episomal origin of replication for efficient propagation in mammalian cell culture.
For integration of the full length (FL-) and ΔIDR-Spen-Halo transgenes into the SPEN-AID-GFP female ESC lines the plasmid pFD46 for targeting into the Rosa26 locus was used (previously described in ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar )). Halo was amplified from plasmid Halo-EasyFusion (Addgene, #112852) and inserted upstream the Spen coding sequence of pFD46 by Infusion cloning, resulting in the plasmid pYM300. Similarly, the FL-Spen coding sequence was excised from pFD46 by restriction digest and Infusion cloning was performed to insert Halo-ΔIDR-Spen amplified from plasmid PyPP-CAG-Halo-Spen-ΔIDR-V5, resulting in plasmid pYM301. For the integration of FL-Spen-Halo into the Xist-FL Cas Xist-ΔΒ 129 female F1 2-1 ESCs and 36.11 cells, a male ESC line carrying an autosomal tetO-Xist transgene (on chromosome 11)( Wutz and Jaenisch, 2000 117. Wutz, A. ∙ Jaenisch, R. A shift from reversible to irreversible X inactivation is triggered during ES cell differentiation Mol. Cell. 2000; 5 :695-705 Google Scholar ), the same strategy was employed. All plasmids were verified by restriction digests and sequencing.
For targeting, F1 2-1 female ESC lines were grown on DR4 feeders. All targetings were performed by electroporation using the GenePulserII (Biorad). Approximately 2 × 10 7 cells and 50 μg of DNA were resuspended in 400 μL PBS in 4mm diameter cuvettes and pulsed twice for 0.2msec at 800V. To target the Rosa26 locus with plasmids pYM300 or pYM301 and pFD82, pFD83 in TX1072 ESCs expressing SPEN-AID-GFP, female F1 2-1 Xist 129ΔB/CasWT ESCs and male ESCs carrying an autosomal tetO-Xist transgene (36.11), the 3D Nucleofector (Lonza) was used with program CG-104 and 100 μL cuvettes according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibiotics were added to the growth media 24-36 h after electroporation. Puromycin was used at 1.5 μg/mL, hygromycin at 130 μg/mL and G418 at 400 μg/mL. The culture medium containing the respective antibiotics was exchanged every 2 to 3 days. Once adequate colony growth was observed (1-2 weeks), 100-200 colonies were picked under a stereoscope, dissociated by trypsinization and seeded in 96-well plate replicates. One replicate plate was used for genomic DNA extraction and subsequent genotyping PCR. All positive clones used in this study were screened to ensure that they maintain two X chromosomes in the undifferentiated state indicated by the presence of two Tsix transcripts in RNA FISH experiments. In addition, we confirmed gene silencing by Xist and normal Xist distribution across the X-territory upon induction of differentiation as applicable ( Figures 1 K and S1 G).
The pBglII5k-24xMS2 plasmid was electroporated into the F1 2-1 ESC line after linearization with XhoI. The cell culture was exposed to neomycin selection 36 h post-electroporation. Colonies were picked and expanded for screening by genotyping PCR and RNA FISH with Xist and MS2 probes was performed on EpiLCs at day 4 as shown in Figure S1 G. We confirmed that the 24xMS2-repeat unit was introduced into the 129 allele ( Figure S1 G, right). This observation comes in line with the known skewing of XCI in 129/Cas female cells, where ∼80% of cells inactivate the 129 allele. The loxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette was removed from targeted ESC clones by transient expression of Cre-recombinase. Subsequently, a FRT-recombination site-containing a landing pad (FRT-neo plasmid) ( Beard et al., 2006 4. Beard, C. ∙ Hochedlinger, K. ∙ Plath, K. ... Efficient method to generate single-copy transgenic mice by site-specific integration in embryonic stem cells Genesis. 2006; 44 :23-28 Google Scholar ) was targeted into the inert Col1A locus (on chromosome 11) in F1 2-1 24xMS2-Xist ESCs. The MCP-GFP-rtTA3 expression cassette was then inserted into the FRT site by electroporation of a FlpO-recombinase-encoding plasmid and the pBS31-MCP-GFP-rtTA3 plasmid. The resulting ESC line was denoted as Xist MS2-GFP .
CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing was used for the deletion of the IDRs of SPEN with two guide RNAs targeting intronic sequences flanking the IDR-encoding exons, which were synthesized by Synthego. Targeting was performed in the TX1072-SPEN-GFP cell line ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ). Cells were targeted using recombinant Cas9 protein (Synthego) and gRNAs with the 4D Nucleofector (Lonza). ∼2.5 × 10 5 cells/mL were resuspended in 20 μL Lonza solution and electroporated with 1.8 μL of gRNA1, 1.8 μL gRNA2 and 2.4 μL Cas9 using program CG-104. gRNA sequences are given in Table S2 . Nucleofected cells were serially diluted and plated onto 10cm dishes. Once adequate colony growth was observed (1-2 weeks), 100 colonies were picked under a stereoscope, dissociated by trypsinization, and seeded in 96-well plate replicates. One replicate plate was used for genomic DNA extraction and subsequent genotyping PCR. Genotyping PCR was performed as shown in Figure S6 A. Positive clones were selected based on an expected 605bp band and sequenced to verify deletion. Biallelic expression was confirmed using RT-PCR with oligo-dT primers and sequencing as shown in Figure S6 B, scoring for SNPs in exon 5 (rs27580268) and exon 7 (rs223335536).
F1 2-1 ESC line previously targeted with an 16xMS2 tag in the large final Xist exon on the 129 allele ( Jonkers et al., 2008 54. Jonkers, I. ∙ Monkhorst, K. ∙ Rentmeester, E. ... Xist RNA is confined to the nuclear territory of the silenced X chromosome throughout the cell cycle Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28 :5583-5594 Google Scholar ) or male V6.5 ESCs expressing Xist under a tetO promoter ( Engreitz et al., 2013 34. Engreitz, J.M. ∙ Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ McDonel, P. ... The Xist lncRNA exploits three-dimensional genome architecture to spread across the X chromosome Science. 2013; 341 :1237973 Google Scholar ) were electroporated with the linearized plasmid 13-5 harboring homology arms for targeting into the B-repeat region of XIST and replacing it with a loxP-flanked hygroTK cassette for antibiotic selection. The loxP-flanked hygroTK resistance cassette was removed from targeted clones by transient expression of the Cre-recombinase and ganciclovir treatment. Genotyping and confirmation of deletion of the B-repeat in both cell lines and targeting on the 129 allele in F1 2-1 ESCs were performed by Southern blotting (not shown).
The gene encoding ct-60 (cage 60GFP ) was amplified by PCR from plasmid I3-01-ct60GFP ( Hsia et al., 2016 48. Hsia, Y. ∙ Bale, J.B. ∙ Gonen, S. ... Design of a hyperstable 60-subunit protein dodecahedron. [corrected] Nature. 2016; 535 :136-139 Google Scholar ). The fragment was introduced under control of the CACGS promoter into the pBS32 plasmid by Infusion reaction yielding pBS32-cage 60GFP and positive clones were confirmed by restriction digests and sequencing. The pBS32 plasmid was derived from the pBS31 plasmid upon replacement of the tetO promoter with a CAGGS promoter. To visualize both Xist MS2-GFP and cage 60GFP , Xist MS2-GFP ESCs were differentiated into EpiLCs to induce endogenous Xist expression and doxycycline was added at 0.5 μg/mL for 2 h to induce MCP-GFP expression. Expression of the cage 60GFP was achieved by transient transfection of the pBS32-cage 60GFP plasmid into differentiating cells by Lipofectamine3000 24 h prior to imaging, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For FRAP experiments of Halo-fused proteins, 5 μM of TMR Halo ligand was added to the culture medium for 30min following a 30min incubation in media without added ligand to wash-off unbound ligand. For fixed and live-cell 3D-SIM imaging, 1 μM JF549 or JF646 Halo ligands were introduced to the media for 15min, washed-off twice with PBS and exchanged with fresh medium which was incubated for another 15 min. Live-cell imaging or fixation was done as described in the corresponding sections.
Immunodetection was performed as described in ( Kraus et al., 2017 57. Kraus, F. ∙ Miron, E. ∙ Demmerle, J. ... Quantitative 3D structured illumination microscopy of nuclear structures Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1011-1028 Google Scholar ). In brief, cells were grown on geltrex-coated high precision coverslips at the desired differentiation state. Coverslips were then transferred to new multi-well plates, washed three times with PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde dissolved in PBS for 10min, followed by two washes with PBST (1xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Samples were then quenched for 10min with 20mM glycine in PBS. Following samples were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 dissolved in PBS for 10min and washed once with PBST. Samples were then blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBST, 2% BSA, 0.5% Fish skin gelatin) and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h in a humidified chamber at RT. Samples where then washed three times with PBST followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 45min and another round of PBST washes. Samples were then washed once with PBS, post-fixed with 4% formaldehyde dissolved in PBS for 10min, followed by two washes with PBST. Chromatin counterstaining was performed using DAPI dissolved in PBST at a concentration of 2 μg/mL for 5min. Samples were then washed four times with PBS, mounted on slides with Vectashield and sealed with Covergrip. For combined Halo ligand and antibody detection, cells were labeled with the Halo ligands as described in the Halo labeling section, fixed and processed by immunostaining. For the 4-color 3D-SIM imaging where we detect combinations of proteins together with Xist MS2-GFP ( Figures 3 B and S3 A) we used CIZ1-Halo and CELF1 antibody staining, SPEN-Halo and CIZ1 antibody staining, PCGF5-Halo and CIZ1/CELF1 antibody staining. Halo transgenes were detected with the Halo ligand JF549 and primary antibodies with secondary antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor647. In Figures 3 H and S4 C we used endogenous Halo-tagged SPEN ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ) and Halo transgenes for detection of CIZ1, PCGF5 and PTBP1 labeled by the Halo ligand JF549 and antibody stainings with primary and secondary antibodies conjugated to CF568 dye for CELF1, RYBP, EZH2 and hnRNP-K. In Figures S6 C and S7 D , we used Halo transgenes FL-/ΔIDR-/ΔRRM-SPEN expressed in Xist MS2-GFP or F1 2-1 Xist 129ΔB/CasWT EpiLCs labeled by the Halo ligand JF549. In Figure S3 F, RYBP and CIZ1 are detected with antibodies and secondaries conjugated to CF568, while SPEN is stably integrated into the Rosa26 locus (plasmid YM301) and detected with the JF549 Halo ligand. In Figure 5 C, we detect the endogenous WT-SPEN-GFP or ΔIDR-SPEN-GFP with anti-GFP antibodies. We compared the distribution of the CIZ1-Halo fusion protein and the endogenous (antibody-stained) CIZ1 protein and show the same trend ( Figure S3 B) similarly to the distribution of endogenously Halo- or GFP-tagged SPEN proteins to Halo tagged transgenes ( Figures 3 H, 5 C, and S6 E).
Endogenous CELF1 was detected with monoclonal rabbit anti-CUG-BP1 antibody ab129115 (1/800; Abcam); hnRNP-K with polyclonal rabbit antibody A300-678A (1/800, Bethyl); MATR3 with polyclonal rabbit antibody IHC-00081 (1/200, Bethyl); RYBP (DEDAF) with polyclonal rabbit antibody AB3637 (1/1000; Sigma); Ezh2 with monoclonal rabbit antibody #5246 (1/500; Cell Signaling Technology); CIZ1 with a polyclonal rabbit antibody NB100-74624 (1/800; Novus Biologicals), and histone H3 phospho-Serine 10 with the polyclonal rabbit anti-histone H3-phospho-Serine10 #39253 (1/1000; Active Motif). GFP with a polyclonal rabbit antibody ab6556 (1/500, Abcam). Two secondary antibodies were used, including high cross-absorbed donkey anti-rabbit IgG CF568 antibody SAB4600076 (1/400; Sigma) and high cross-absorbed goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 antibody A21245 (1/400; Life Technologies).
Probes for DNA and RNA FISH experiments were labeled by Nick Translation (NT) as previously described ( Cremer et al., 2008 25. Cremer, M. ∙ Grasser, F. ∙ Lanctôt, C. ... Multicolor 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization for imaging interphase chromosomes Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 463 :205-239 Google Scholar ). Briefly, 1 μg of DNA was labeled in a 50 μL NT reaction for 8 h using 1.3-2.5 μL fluorescently-labeled dUTPs, 1 μL of DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2 μL of DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) from a stock which was freshly prepared by a 1:200 dilution in ice-cold H 2 O. NT reactions were purified using magnetic beads, probes were then resuspended in Nuclease-free H 2 O and ethanol-precipitated together with Salmon sperm and Cot1 DNA at −80°C ON. After precipitation and washes with ethanol series (70%–100%), probes were resuspended in deionized formamide with shaking at 37°C ON. Probes were then adjusted in hybridization buffer (50%formamide, 2 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate) and stored at −20°C. To create mouse Xist probes, we used a full-length mouse Xist cDNA plasmid (p15A-31-17.9kb Xist). Human XIST probes were created from a full-length XIST cDNA construct. For assessing X-linked gene silencing, Atrx probes were synthesized using BAC RP23-265D6, Rlim probes using fosmid WI1-2704K12 and Mecp2 probes using fosmid WI-894A5. For the chromosome barcoding experiment, we used BACs RP23-53H15, RP23-83J1, RP23-451D5, RP24-81K23, RP24-374B8, RP23-401G5, RP23-104K18. To create an intronic probe against the first intron of Xist , the corresponding region was amplified from the Xist-encoding BAC RP23-223G18 and was labeled by NT. To create MS2 probes the corresponding region was amplified from plasmid #31865 (Addgene) and labeled by NT. For multispectral chromosome barcoding experiments, individual BACs were labeled separately, pooled in a 1:1 ratio and used at 0.1 μg/cm 2 . DNA from flow sorted mouse X-chromosomes was a gift from Irina Solovei and labeled using the Bioprimer kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. NT products were labeled with Atto488-dUTP, Alexa Fluor 568-dUTP, Cy3-dUTP, Cy5-dUTP, Texas Red-dUTP and chromosome paints were labeled with Atto448-dUTPs or Cy3-dUTPs.

All BACs and fosmids used in this study were purchased from CHORI-BACPAC.
We selected 20 early (half time [0-0.4] days) and 20 very late (half time [1-1.6] days) silencing genes from published silencing kinetics data ( Barros de Andrade E. Sousa et al., 2019 3. Barros de Andrade E. Sousa, L. ∙ Jonkers, I. ∙ Syx, L. ... Kinetics of Xist -induced gene silencing can be predicted from combinations of epigenetic and genomic features Genome Res. 2019; 29 :1087-1099 Google Scholar ) that are longer than 10kb and have high expression levels in ESCs. To ensure the assessment of genes across the length of the chromosome, we selected no more than five genes per early or late silencing group from each 10Mb region of the X chromosome.
The resulting early silencing genes were: ENSMUSG00000025862, ENSMUSG00000055780, ENSMUSG00000036022, ENSMUSG00000023092, ENSMUSG00000000838, ENSMUSG00000016382, ENSMUSG00000025246, ENSMUSG00000025059, ENSMUSG00000035232, ENSMUSG00000050332, ENSMUSG00000079487, ENSMUSG00000034055, ENSMUSG00000056537, ENSMUSG00000046449, ENSMUSG00000031333, ENSMUSG00000031232, ENSMUSG00000025531, ENSMUSG00000025271, ENSMUSG00000041649, ENSMUSG00000025289.
The late silencing genes were: ENSMUSG00000031161, ENSMUSG00000040363, ENSMUSG00000031012, ENSMUSG00000031060, ENSMUSG00000001173, ENSMUSG00000063785, ENSMUSG00000025630, ENSMUSG00000031351, ENSMUSG00000002015, ENSMUSG00000031328, ENSMUSG00000031197, ENSMUSG00000006678, ENSMUSG00000035150, ENSMUSG00000034480, ENSMUSG00000041229, ENSMUSG00000045180, ENSMUSG00000046873, ENSMUSG00000067194, ENSMUSG00000079316, ENSMUSG00000031352.
We note that the first 40Mb of the chromosome are poor in early-silencing genes that provide high expression levels (RPKMs) for sufficient detection by oligonucleotide FISH. Custom fluorescent oligonucleotide probe pools (MyTags) targeting either genes or their corresponding transcripts were designed and synthesized by Daicel Arbor Biosciences. To detect nascent gene transcripts, ∼500 45bp oligonucleotide probes targeting gene introns downstream of the transcriptional start site of the gene were synthesized spanning 31 to 68kb. To detect genes, ∼500 45bp anti-sense oligonucleotide probes targeting upstream of the transcriptional start site were synthesized, spanning between 31 to 61kb. Probe sequences are given in Table S2 .
RNA and DNA FISH experiments were conducted as previously described ( Markaki et al., 2013 63. Markaki, Y. ∙ Smeets, D. ∙ Cremer, M. ... Fluorescence in situ hybridization applications for super-resolution 3D structured illumination microscopy Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 950 :43-64 Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were grown on geltrex-coated high precision coverslips at the desired differentiation state. Coverslips were then transferred to new multi-well plates, washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3% formaldehyde dissolved in PBS for 10min, followed by two washes with PBS. Samples were then quenched for 10min with 20mM glycine in PBS. Following, samples were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 dissolved in PBS for 15min, washed twice with PBST, equilibrated in 2xSSC for 10min and incubated for 30min to 2 h with 50%formamide/ 2xSSC. Probes were denatured at 76°C for 7min and kept on ice. To hybridize the specimens, probes were spotted on slides and coverslips were placed on the probes and sealed with rubber cement. All probes were used at 0.1 μg/cm 2 and oligonucleotide probes were used at 10pmol/cm 2 . For DNA FISH, a denaturation step was performed for 2min at 76°C. Samples were then hybridized in a humidified chamber at 37°C ON. After demounting coverslips, unbound probes were washed-off with three 20min washes with 2xSSCT (2xSSC, 0.5% Tween 20) under mild shaking, followed by three 5min washes with 4xSSCT. For DNA FISH samples were washed with three additional 5min washes with 0.1xSSC. Following, samples were post-fixed and chromatin was counterstained with DAPI as described in the Immunofluorescence staining section.
For sequential RNA and DNA FISH experiments with X chromosome paints (mmX paints) or oligonucleotide probes and Xist probes, RNA FISH was performed first, samples were post-fixed and DNA FISH followed. For the detection of SPEN proteins fused to GFP together with Xist RNA, detected by FISH probes, immunodetection was performed first, samples were post-fixed and RNA FISH followed.
Confocal and improved confocal (Airyscan detector) laser scanning microscopy was performed on the LSM880 platform equipped with 100x/1.46NA or 63x/1.4 NA plan Apochromat oil objectives and 405/488 diode and 594 Helium-Neon lasers (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY). To optimize imaging and reduce photobleaching, the regions of interest (ROIs) in each case were marked and the appropriate magnifications were used. The pixel size and z-optical sectioning were set to meet the Nyquist sampling criterion in each case. Airyscan raw data were reconstructed using the ZEN Black (v2.3) software.
For the detection of genomic regions across the X chromosome with spectral barcoding, cells were seeded on gridded coverslips and DNA FISH was performed first. 5-color optical z stacks of 0.35 μm were acquired on a confocal Zeiss LSM880 system. Grid coordinates were recorded, and spatial coordinates of the acquired positions were registered on the ZEN Black software and saved. Following, samples were equilibrated with 50% formamide in 2xSSC pH 7.2 solution for 3 h at 37°C followed by RNA FISH with Cy3-labeled Xist probes. Specimens were returned to the microscope stage and saved spatial coordinates were revisited to acquire the Xist RNA signal and discriminate between the Xi and Xa in downstream analyses. Although hybridization of RNA usually precedes DNA FISH, we have found that Xist RNA is remarkably stable during the sequential process. Since the sequential hybridization for this experiment was only necessary for the scoring of the Xi, without the need for harsh probe strip-off steps, RNA FISH was performed last.
To discriminate between different cell cycle stages, we used a combination of EdU pulse labeling, to detect S-phase cells, and anti-histone H3-phospho-Serine10 (Active Motif, #39253), to detect G2/M phase cells, while G1 cells remained marker-free. EdU and click-iT labeling were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 10mM EdU stock solution was diluted 1:1000 in growth media and cells were pulsed for 20min prior to fixation. RNA FISH with Xist probes was performed in the 488 channel and detection of EdU by click-iT reaction with CF dye Azide 568 (Biotium, #92082) was combined with immunodetection of phospho-histone H3 Serine 10 and secondary antibodies conjugated to CF568, where RNA FISH was performed first ( Markaki et al., 2013 63. Markaki, Y. ∙ Smeets, D. ∙ Cremer, M. ... Fluorescence in situ hybridization applications for super-resolution 3D structured illumination microscopy Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 950 :43-64 Google Scholar ). For the assessment of Xist foci features and number throughout the cell cycle in EpiLCs (at day 4 of differentiation), we used the Xist MS2-GFP cell line and detected Xist MS2-GFP signals after addition of 0.5 μg/mL doxycycline for 2 h (for MCP-GFP induction).
3D-Structured Illumination Microscopy (3D-SIM) was performed on a DeltaVision OMX-SR system (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) equipped with a 60x/1.42 NA Plan Apo oil immersion objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), sCMOS cameras (PCO, Kelheim, Germany) and 405, 488, 642nm diode lasers and a 568nm DPSS laser. Image stacks were acquired on the OMX AcquireSR software package 4.4.9934 with a z-steps of 125nm and with 15 raw images per plane (five phases, three angles). Raw data were computationally reconstructed with the soft-WoRx 7.0.0 software package (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) using a Wiener filter set at 0.001 to 0.002 (up to 0.006 for DAPI) and optical transfer functions (OTFs) measured specifically for each channel using immersion oil with different refractive indices (RIs) as described in ( Demmerle et al., 2017 28. Demmerle, J. ∙ Innocent, C. ∙ North, A.J. ... Strategic and practical guidelines for successful structured illumination microscopy Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :988-1010 Google Scholar ; Kraus et al., 2017 57. Kraus, F. ∙ Miron, E. ∙ Demmerle, J. ... Quantitative 3D structured illumination microscopy of nuclear structures Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1011-1028 Google Scholar ). Images from different channels were registered using alignment parameters obtained from a calibration slide of 100nm gold grid holes and a second calibration for axial alignment using 100nm diameter Tetraspeck beads according to established procedures ( Demmerle et al., 2017 28. Demmerle, J. ∙ Innocent, C. ∙ North, A.J. ... Strategic and practical guidelines for successful structured illumination microscopy Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :988-1010 Google Scholar ).
Wide-field and confocal scanning microscopy (for FRAP experiments) or 3D-SIM live-cell imaging (4D-SIM) were performed at 37°C (for 3D-SIM in conjunction with an objective heater), with 5% CO 2 , controlled humidity and 10%O 2 , having equilibrated the system and immersion oils for at least five h prior to acquisitions. This equilibration was particularly important for obtaining artifact-free 3D-SIM datasets and minimize stage drift. Cells were differentiated in geltrex-coated chambers fitted with a high precision glass (ibidi) with daily exchange of media. To induce MCP-GFP expression, doxycycline was added to the cells two h prior to acquisitions at a concentration of 1 μg/mL. Imaging was performed in media containing no phenol red and supplemented with ProlongLive Antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher). For live-cell 3D-SIM imaging, typically 1 μm to 2 μm stacks of 125nm z sections were acquired in 1- or 2-color 3D-SIM imaging to obtain 240-500 raw images per frame in 5-8 s intervals depending on exposure times and z-depth. Photobleaching over time was corrected by using histogram matching on the BleachCorrection plugin in ImageJ/Fiji.
FRAP experiments with z sectioning for Xist MS2-GFP and CIZ1-mCherry were performed on an LSM880 equipped with an Airyscan on a Plan-Apochromat 63x1.4NA oil immersion objective, an image size of 67.5 μm x 67.5 μm with a pixel size of 0.085 μm. Z-optical stacks of 0.5 μm were obtained through a 15 μm z-depth. Bleaching was performed in ROIs demarcating the Xist territory or corresponding nuclear (control) regions at full laser power and 4 iterations with a pixel dwell time of 4.04 μsec. The first post-bleach frame was acquired immediately after bleaching. Time series were acquired every 1.3min up to 10 frames and every 2min thereafter for a total of 30min with an Argon ion 488nm laser or a DPSS 561nm laser set to 1% laser power.
Single-plane FRAP experiments for all other proteins were performed on the OMX-SR platform in widefield mode and an image size of 512x512 pixels with a pixel size of 0.08 μm. In these experiments, we employed transgenic cells lines carrying mCherry-tagged CIZ1 and CELF1 and Halo-tagged FL-/ΔIDR-/ΔRMM-SPEN, PCGF5 and PTBP1, respectively ( Figures 4 F, S5 D, and S6 F). Images were acquired for Xist MS2-GFP in the 488nm channel (95MHz- 6% amplitude, 20msec) and for all mCherry- or Halo-fused-TMR labeled proteins in the 568nm channel (272MHz, 6% amplitude, 50-100ms exposure). Bleaching in ROIs demarcating the Xist territory or nuclear (control) regions was performed by using the 568nm laser line in the Ring-TIRF/PK photokinetics module with a bleach spot of 1 μm for one iteration for 0.1sec.
F1 2-1 female mouse ESCs were seeded on geltrex-coated plates and differentiated for 2 or 4 days. 5 × 10 6 cells were collected per condition after dissociation by accutase and RAP-seq was performed ( Engreitz et al., 2013 34. Engreitz, J.M. ∙ Pandya-Jones, A. ∙ McDonel, P. ... The Xist lncRNA exploits three-dimensional genome architecture to spread across the X chromosome Science. 2013; 341 :1237973 Google Scholar ). Briefly, harvested cells were incubated for 45min with 2mM DSG in PBS at RT, crosslinked with 3% formaldehyde for 10min and quenched with 500mM glycine. Following, cells were pelleted at 1,500xg for 5min and flash frozen. Pellets were resuspended in 10ml nuclear extraction buffer LB1 containing 50mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.5% (vol/vol) NP-40/Igepal CA-630 and 0.25% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and incubated for 10min with rotation at 4°C, then pelleted at 2000xg for 5min and the same procedure was followed with buffer LB2, containing 10mM Tris-HCL (pH 8.0), 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA and 0.5mM EGTA ( Mohammed et al., 2016 70. Mohammed, H. ∙ Taylor, C. ∙ Brown, G.D. ... Rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME) for analysis of chromatin complexes Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :316-326 Google Scholar ). For cell lysis, nuclei were resuspended in 300 μL buffer LB3 containing 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 0.1% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate and 0.5% (vol/vol) N-lauroylsarcosine and sonicated on ice using a Misonix S-400 sonicator with microtip for 2min with 1sec pulses intermitted by 3sec pauses. Chromatin was then digested using TURBO DNase at a concentration of 0.1-0.4U/μl at 37°C for 15min. For each pulldown library, an input library was also generated. The RNA pulldown was performed using 50pmol of 90nt long biotinylated oligonucleotide probes for every 5 × 10 6 cells and Streptavidin C1 beads. DNA was eluted by RNase H digestion, and the crosslinks were reversed by proteinase K digestion of the eluted DNA at 60þC. The DNA libraries were prepared using NEB Next Ultra End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (NEB) and TruSeq DNA adapters (Illumina) were ligated using Quick Ligase (NEB). Libraries were amplified by KAPA HiFi Polymerase, pooled and sequenced on the Illlumina HiSeq 6000 platform to generate 50bp pair-end reads. Probe sequences are given in Table S2 .
scRNA-seq was performed in F1 2-1 Xist 129-WT/Cas-WT and Xist 129-ΔB/Cas-WT ESC lines at days 2 and 4 of EpiLC differentiation. For the B6 tetO-Xist Cas WT-Xist TX1072 ESC lines expressing SPEN-GFP or ΔSPOC-SPEN-GFP ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ) and ΔIDR-SPEN-GFP generated in this study, scRNA-seq was performed without (0 h) or with (24 h) of 0.5 μg/mL doxycycline to induce tetO-Xist expression.
Cells were dissociated with accutase for 5min, washed 3 times with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 0.04% BSA. Cell concentration was adjusted between 800 to 1200 cells/μl and cell suspension was kept on ice before loading on the 10x Genomics Chromium instrument. scRNA-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium single cell 3′¢ reagent kit V3.1. Individual libraries were designed to target up to 10,000 cells. Libraries were generated following manufacturer’s instructions and library fragment size distribution was determined by BioAnalyzer. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform to generate 100bp pair-end reads.
Bulk mRNA-seq libraries were generated from B6 tetO-Xist Cas WT-Xist TX1072 ESC lines homozygously expressing WT-SPEN-AID-GFP ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ), with no Rosa26 knockin rescue, full length (FL)-SPEN Rosa26 knockin rescue, or ΔIDR-SPEN Rosa26 knockin rescue, at 0 h and 24 h dox treatment and upon auxin treatment. Harvested cells were washed with PBS and collected into TRI reagent. Lysates were processed immediately or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for up to 3 days. All conditions were collected from three biological replicates where samples for each replicate were processed at the same time. RNA was isolated using the Zymo Research RNA miniprep isolation kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TrueSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform to generate 100bp pair-end reads.
CLAP-seq libraries were generated from B6 tetO-Xist Cas WT-Xist TX1072 derivative ESC lines expressing the FL-, ΔIDR- or ΔRRM-Halo-SPEN at day 4 of differentiation with the addition of 0.5 μg/mL doxycycline for the last 24 h to induce tetO-Xist expression. For each pulldown library, an input library was also generated. ∼5 × 10 7 cells were collected for each replicate. Cells grown on gelatin-coated 150cm 2 culture dishes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and UV-cross-linked on ice using 0.25 Jcm−2 (UV2.5k) at 254 nm in a Spectrolinker UV Crosslinker. Cells were then collected through scraping on ice and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 5min, washed once with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation in aliquots of 5 × 10 6 cells. Pellets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C. CLAP-seq using the HaloLink Resin to pulldown the Halo-tagged proteins was performed as previously described ( Quinodoz et al., 2020 86. Quinodoz, S.A. ∙ Bhat, P. ∙ Ollikainen, N. ... RNA promotes the formation of spatial compartments in the nucleus bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.2008.2025.267435 Google Scholar ). In brief, each pellet was lysed for 10min in 1ml Lysis buffer containing 50mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Promega), 200U of Murine RNase Inhibitor, 20U Turbo DNase and 1X Manganese/Calcium Mix (0.5mM CaCl2, 2.5mM MnCl2) at 37°C. Lysates were pelleted at 800xg for 8min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed and pellets were resuspended in 1ml Lysis buffer and sonicated for 30sec with 0.7sec pulses intermitted by 2.3sec pauses. After removal a 10min incubation at 37°C, samples were pelleted at 15,000xg for 2min and the resulting supernatant was collected and stored on ice. The HaloLink Resin was washed three times in Wash buffer (1xPBS, 0.1% Triton) and blocked for 20min in Blocking buffer (50mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 μg/mL Random 9-mer, 100 μg/mL BSA). Following the HaloLink Resin was incubated with the supernatant for 3-16 h under rotation at 4°C. After incubation, three washes in Wash buffer were performed at RT and three additional washes at 90C for 2min with the following buffers: NLS buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2% NLS, 10mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 10mM DTT), High Salt Buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 1M NaCl), 8M Urea Buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 8M Urea) and Tween buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 10mM EDTA). The HaloLink Resin was then equilibrated by washing three times with Elution buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40) at 30C and elution was performed by resuspension in 100 μL of NLS buffer containing 10% Proteinase K and shaking at 50°C for 30min. Successful elution of the Halo-fused proteins was tested by western blotting. After elution RNA overhangs were repaired by treatment with FastAP and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase with no ATP at 37°C for 15min and 1 h, respectively. The RNA was then reverse transcribed using Superscript III according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following, the cDNA was amplified by PCR using illumina sequencing adaptors libraries, pooled and sequenced on the Illlumina HiSeq 6000 platform to generate 100bp pair-end reads.
For image segmentation and image objects (particles) determination, 32-bit raw datasets were imported into ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 94. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Google Scholar ) and converted to 16-bit tiff composite stacks. The segmentation of Xist and protein particles (foci) was performed as previously described ( Kraus et al., 2017 57. Kraus, F. ∙ Miron, E. ∙ Demmerle, J. ... Quantitative 3D structured illumination microscopy of nuclear structures Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1011-1028 Google Scholar ) using the TANGO suite ( Ollion et al., 2013 78. Ollion, J. ∙ Cochennec, J. ∙ Loll, F. ... TANGO: a generic tool for high-throughput 3D image analysis for studying nuclear organization Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :1840-1841 Google Scholar ). Specifically, raw datasets without filtering or subtraction of signals were imported into the segmentation pipeline. Image segmentation pipelines, adjustment of thresholds and creation of seeds were performed using high-throughput batch-processing and without manual intervention. Resulting masks of segmented particles were inspected by overlays over the raw data to ensure that the majority of signals was contained in the area to be analyzed. Nuclear masks were created using the DAPI channel as the segmentation volume. For each channel, a duplicate was generated and filtered with a 3D Gaussian filter with standard deviation of 1 (σ = 1) and a Tophat filter with a radius of two pixels in xy and a one-pixel radius in z. The filtered image was segmented using the 3D Suite’s Watershed method. Seed threshold and image threshold for watershed were calculated by equations Mean+StdDev ∗ 2 ∗ seed multiplier and (Mean+StdDev ∗ 2 ∗ seed multiplier)/image multiplier (Signal-to-Noise Ratio, SNR), respectively, where seed multiplier and image multiplier were determined and inspected manually to ensure the inclusion of all the regions of interest (ROIs) and the removal of background noise. Object features and distance measurements were performed using the 3D ImageJ Suite’s “Measure 3D,” “Quantif 3D” and “Distance” option plugins for ImageJ/Fiji.
For the assessment of the cage 60GFP versus Xist signals, Xist MS2-GFP cells expressing the cage 60GFP plasmid were typically imaged in the same Field of View (FOV) as cells with the Xist MS2-GFP signal, allowing us to obtain data that could be directly compared. When cells expressed both entities, since the cages are located in the cytosol in the majority of cells, nuclear masks from the DAPI channel were created and Xist MS2-GFP signals were measured inside the masked regions, whereas the signal from the GFP-expressing cages was measured outside the nuclear masks. For the comparison of intensities of cages expressed in the cytosol or in the nucleus the same masking procedure was applied. The variability of the integrated density of fluorescent cages imaged under 3D-SIM conditions was compared to that obtained by a similar analysis in the original publication ( Hsia et al., 2016 48. Hsia, Y. ∙ Bale, J.B. ∙ Gonen, S. ... Design of a hyperstable 60-subunit protein dodecahedron. [corrected] Nature. 2016; 535 :136-139 Google Scholar ) and found that results are within the same range.
The number of Xist foci is typically lower when detecting the RNA via MCP-GFP compared to detection by RNA FISH using probes that cover the entire spliced transcript. Our labeling with FISH probes captures the entire RNA molecule in contrast to MCP-GFP, which detects a region in the last large exon of Xist downstream to the E-repeat sequence. Therefore, RNA FISH-based detection results in slightly larger and possibly more complex Xist structures. Moreover, the different average number of Xist foci between cells at D2, D4, D8 of differentiation or in C127 cells, defined across the cell population without discriminating cell cycle stage ( Figures 1 L, S1 I, and S2 B), is likely a reflection of different populations of cells across the different cell states.
For the comparison of the integrated densities of SPEN-GFP and cage 60GFP , cells expressing the cage 60GFP plasmid and TX1072 (B6 tetO-Xist Cas WT-Xist ) derivative cells expressing SPEN-GFP after addition of 0.5 μg/mL doxycycline, to induce expression of the tetO-Bgl-mCherry- Xist ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ), were imaged under the same settings and datasets processed with the same threshold to define seeds and objects (particles). We found that the increase in Xist -associated SPEN accumulation during differentiation, observed from the D2 to D4 transition, also occurs similarly upon doxycycline induction of Xist expression between 6 and 18 h of Xist induction. Moreover, the levels of SPEN in SMACs are the same upon tetO-Xist induction at 18 h as for WT-Xist at D4 of differentiation (not shown).
To extract global nuclear protein particle features (in and outside the Xi) such as mean intensity, integrated density (amount of fluorescence per defined particle volume) and volume, masks of the protein signals of interest were created by filtering raw data with a 3D Gaussian blur followed by automatic thresholding to include all signals and exclude nucleoli. ROIs within a 4 μm radius of Xist centroids were selected for features extraction to limit computation time. Nearest neighbor centroid distances and all distances between ROIs within each channel and across different channels were extracted using the 3D ImageJ Suite for minimal distance and average distance analysis, respectively. Distance averaging was performed in Python. Assignment of Xist -associated signals was based on a proximity threshold to Xist centroids with a radius of 250nm. Signals 500nm away from Xist centroids, resulting in a ‘rim’ around the Xi due to the scattering of many Xist foci throughout the Xi, were defined as the nuclear fraction. To test the specificity of the tight spatial association of Xist and its associated protein particles in the Xi, we performed randomized controls ( Figure S4 D). We first determined the Xi territory by generating voxel arrays corresponding to a 350nm radius from Xist foci centroids. The overlapping (double-called) voxels were removed. We then generated random positions equal to Xist -associated protein particles within the Xi masks of each nucleus using Python’s numpy.random.choice function. We found a statistically significant difference between the nearest-neighbor Xist -associated protein particle to Xist compared to the randomized positions to Xist . The comparison of protein features, such as integrated density of fluorescence and volume, was performed by measurements acquired in the same laser line (568nm) for all proteins detected either with the Halo ligand JF549 or primary and secondary antibodies conjugated to CF568 dye. For each experiment, ROIs with integrated density and volume values below the 10th percentile or above the 90th percentile of the dataset were removed as outliers.
For the oligo-FISH analysis, signal centroid from 3D-SIM data were extracted as described above using the 3D ImageJ Suite. Signal coordinates were imported into Python using Pandas and separated by cell and signal type (late, early, DNA, RNA, Xist ) into NumPy arrays. We detected on average ∼10-30 foci for each gene pool per X chromosome. Numbers in the higher range can likely be explained by the detection of some genomic regions as doublets after DNA replication or the segmentation of extended structures. Xist cluster centroids were calculated for each nucleus using the corresponding Xist array and centroid formula: 𝐺 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧 = ( 𝑥 1 + 𝑥 2 + 𝑥 3 + … + 𝑥 𝑛 𝑛 , 𝑦 1 + 𝑦 2 + 𝑦 3 + … + 𝑦 𝑛 𝑛 , 𝑧 1 + 𝑧 2 + 𝑧 3 + … + 𝑧 𝑛 𝑛 )
Distance to Xist centroid was then calculated using the spatial coordinates of each gene centroid to Xist centroid for the corresponding nucleus using the distance formula. Gene transcriptional activity was determined by pairing DNA signals to RNA signals in each nucleus. Nearest neighbors (NN) of DNA and RNA were determined by calculating the distance between DNA and RNA centroids. DNA centroids with a NN RNA closer than 350 nm were paired and labeled as “active genes” while those with a NN farther away were labeled as “silent genes.”
Confocal optical stacks were imported to ImageJ/Fiji and converted to 16-bit tiffs. Raw data were processed using the “Smooth” function and an automatic threshold, using either the Yen or Otsu method, was set to create 3D masks for the X chromosome territories. Assignment of the Xi was based on RNA FISH signals from the Xist channel. Masks were imported into 3D Suite and the volume and sphericity measurements of the X chromosomes (Xa and Xi) were extracted. Sphericity is defined as the length of the object over its width, with a maximum value of one.
Confocal optical stacks from sequential rounds were imported into Fiji/ImageJ and superimposed and alignment of the two sequential rounds was performed with the affine transformation of the StackReg plugin based on the DAPI channel. Data were smoothed with a 3D Gaussian blur with a standard deviation of 1 (σ = 1) and background removal was performed using the “Subtract Background” plugin with a rolling ball radius of 10 pixels. The Xa and Xi (scored by the presence of Xist RNA) were identified and saved as separate stacks. Subsequently, each probe signal centroid was extracted using the “3D Object Counter” plugin. The 3D Object Counter generated a list of coordinates of probe signals for each channel. To assign signals to multi-spectral barcodes consisting of two labels, a nearest neighbor search between the two corresponding channels was applied based on all spatial coordinates in each channel. Once pairs of signals were assigned to the multi-spectral barcodes the coordinates obtained in the shortest wavelength were used. In cases where two adjacent signals were detected per probe, potentially due to the presence of transcripts or DNA replication, only one of the signals was used.
The coordinates of individual barcodes for the Xa and Xi at days 2 and 4 of EpiLC differentiation were reoriented in 3D space to compute spatial statistics across all cells. To obtain configurations of chromosomal backbones, for each set of probe coordinates, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in the x and y axes using MATLAB. The z axis was unused as the segmentation resolution in that axis is significantly lower, contributing to large variations in the z coordinate ( Finn et al., 2017 36. Finn, E.H. ∙ Pegoraro, G. ∙ Shachar, S. ... Comparative analysis of 2D and 3D distance measurements to study spatial genome organization Methods. 2017; 123 :47-55 Google Scholar ) and confounding the reorientation method used, which is highly sensitive to anisotropic error. The principal component is assumed to be the “backbone” of the chromosome: the expected orientation of a chromosome if initially stretched out along that component’s direction before entropically relaxing into an equilibrium configuration. Each set of probes is rotated in order to align its corresponding principal components with the y axis and translated such that the probes’ centroid is aligned with the coordinate origin. Probes of the same loci were then statistically compared to locate their local spatial centroid and 95% confidence interval for Xa day 2, Xi day 2, Xa day 4, and Xi day 4 separately. Ellipsoids encompassing the 95% confidence interval were plotted around each loci centroid. In order to quantify the relative compaction between Xa and Xi from day 2 to day 4, the pairwise distances of 3D coordinates (x,y,z) between each barcode location were measured and averaged over all cells. Averages of Xa distances were subtracted from those of Xi at day 2 and the same was done for day 4 in order to measure the absolute change between chromosomes. A heatmap of this change was plotted, where large negative numbers indicate a higher compaction.
Individual Xist particles from live-cell 3D-SIM data were extracted using TrackMate ( Tinevez et al., 2017 105. Tinevez, J.Y. ∙ Perry, N. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrackMate: An open and extensible platform for single-particle tracking Methods. 2017; 115 :80-90 Google Scholar ), an ImageJ plugin. DoG Detector with a 0.2 μm diameter was used to define the particles and the Simple LAP Tracker with 0.25 max linking distance, 0.3 gap-closing max distance and 2 gap-closing max frame gap were used to track the particles and generate trajectories. Trajectories that were not possible to track for over 10 consecutive frames were not used. Over 850 trajectories from 30 cells were analyzed and approximately 50% of all Xist foci could be tracked without manual intervention per nucleus for an average of 2min. To characterize the motion of Xist foci, the data extracted from the software were fed into downstream confinement analyses described in Methods S1 (see section on “ Xist foci position trajectories and effective confining potentials”).
Two types of motion are captured simultaneously in live-cell 3D-SIM microscopy: a) the developmental motion of the cell and the nucleus, and b) the individual motion of Xist foci within the nucleus. To specifically extract (b) from live-cell 3D-SIM images we implemented the following processing pipeline using Python: 1) A set of Xist foci were tracked using TrackMate and spatial coordinates were extracted and imported into Python using PyTrackmate. 2) For each timestep t , the individual displacement vectors x i,t of each Xist focus were calculated using NumPy and Pandas. 3) For each time-step, individual displacement vectors were averaged to obtain X t, an approximation of the developmental motion in that time-step. 4) This developmental motion was then subtracted from the displacement vector of each Xist focus to arrive at an approximation to granule i ‘s motion, x i,t - X t .
Histone H2B-Halo JF646 intensities were extracted on ImageJ/Fiji plugin using the “getValue” macro command, that iterates over every pixel in the image to get the intensity value of each pixel, generating a list of all the pixel intensities and their corresponding coordinates. The list of intensities was imported to Python. Then, seven intensity/density classes of equal variance were determined. The 3D Suite was used to create Xist masks, and Xist trajectories were extracted from TrackMate to obtain spatial coordinates (centroids) from each time point. The matrices were paired within the radius of one pixel and chromatin density classes were measured under the masks. Radial distances were measured at all pixels within the respective 100, 250, 500 nm radius of the Xist centroid and the maximal intensity value within that range was defined. Averaged values were then plotted in a line graph as a function of time. To extract the nearest neighbors (NN) in chromatin density maps, neighboring intensities for each H2B pixel were determined as the average intensity of all adjacent pixels and stored in an array. A strip plot was used to plot the averaged intensity values where each value was assigned to one of the 7 classes based on the class of the origin pixel ( Figure S2 L).
FRAP time series were imported into Fiji and converted to 16-bit tiffs. Datasets from Xist and CIZ1 derived from z stacking were projected for each time point. To correct for drift, images were registered using the Correct3DDrift plugin and datasets that could not be registered were discarded. To measure FRAP recoveries data were normalized for fluorescence decay as described ( Dundr and Misteli, 2003 32. Dundr, M. ∙ Misteli, T. Measuring dynamics of nuclear proteins by photobleaching Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2003; Google Scholar ). In brief, ∼2 μm user-defined ROIs were created to define and measure the bleached region ( I t ), a randomly selected unbleached nuclear region ( T t ), and a randomly selected region outside the cell ( B t ) for each time point. A relative intensity for each time point was calculated using the equation: I rel = ( T 0 − B 0 ) × ( I (t) – B (t) )/( T (t) − B (t) ) × ( I 0 – B 0 ) where T 0 and I 0 are derived from the average intensity of the region of interest during prebleach. To derive the FRAP recovery, I rel was measured through time. For compiling figures, FRAP time series were bleach-corrected using the BleachCorrect ImageJ/Fiji plugin. To infer dissociation rates and residence times, FRAP curves for Xist and all proteins were fit to single or double exponential models derived from mass-action kinetics. Squared errors were minimized to obtain best-fit detachment rates, binding site densities, and freely diffusing fractions described in the Methods S1 (“Mass-action binding and dissociation model of FRAP dynamics”).
Data analysis and visualization were performed using Python and executed in Google Colaboratory. All violin plots, boxplots, bar plots and point-plots were generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib. NumPy and SciPy were used for mathematical computation and Pandas for data analysis. Unless stated otherwise, all graphs show the median as the central point or the central line, and bars on point plots represent the standard deviation. Point plots of protein integrated density and volume in Figures 3 H, S3 B, S5 J, S5K, and S6 D show the percentage of the maximum absolute value in each group. Statistical differences between two groups were analyzed by the two-sided Wilcoxon’s or Mann-Whitney rank-sum test (scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu). The Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used for statistical comparisons between multiple groups (scipy.stats.kruskal). Statistical significance was defined as a p value less than 0.05.
RAP-seq reads were trimmed using trim_galore (v0.4.1) with default parameters to remove the standard Illumina adaptor sequences. Bowtie2 (v2.2.9) was used to align reads to the mouse genome (mm9) with the default parameters. Reads with mapping quality less than 30 were removed using samtools (v1.2). Picard MarkDuplicates (v2.1.0) was used to remove PCR duplicates. Bedtools intersect (v2.26.0) was used to count reads in sliding windows (100Kb every 25Kb) along the X chromosome. Xist localization across the X chromosome was defined by calculating the Xist enrichment scores ( Xist pulldown/input) in the sliding windows. Unmappable regions were masked.
MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 121. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Google Scholar ) was used to call broadPeaks in D2 and D4 Xist pulldown data, using the input as control. Peaks within 50kb were merged. To identify overlapping Xist peaks between D2 and D4, the respective X-linked peak sets were intersected using bedtools intersect. The most significant peaks were selected with a log 10 (qvalue)>13 cutoff. The R package makeVennDiagram with connectedPeaks = min was used to make the Venn Diagram from the two peak ranges.
To plot the average Xist enrichment around the summits of Xist peaks, Xist peak summits defined for D2 were used and filtered for summit scores > 100 on the X chromosome. The RAP-seq enrichment scores for 2500kb up and downstream of these D2 summits were extracted from the D2 and D4 data using normalizeToMatrix function in the R package EnrichedHeatmap.
To compare Hi-C compartmentalization and Xist enrichment, Hi-C PC1 values were downloaded from GSE99991 ( Wang et al., 2018 111. Wang, C.Y. ∙ Jegu, T. ∙ Chu, H.P. ... SMCHD1 Merges Chromosome Compartments and Assists Formation of Super-Structures on the Inactive X Cell. 2018; 174 :406-421.e25 Google Scholar ). Analysis was performed in R (v3.6.0). Hi-C PC1 values from undifferentiated ESCs were correlated with Xist enrichment at D2 and Hi-C PC1 values at differentiation D4 with Xist enrichment at D4. In addition, Xist enrichment at D2 and D4 were correlated. Datasets were intersected with plyranges (v1.4.4) ( Lee et al., 2019 60. Lee, S. ∙ Cook, D. ∙ Lawrence, M. plyranges: a grammar of genomic data transformation Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :4 Google Scholar ). Plots were made with ggplot2 (v3.3.2) and pearson’s correlation coefficients and p values (two-sided t test, r≠0) were calculated with the function stat_cor in the R package ggpubr (v0.4.0).
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified to distinguish the mus castaneous (Cas) genome from the 129S4/SvJae (129) or C57BL/6J (B6, reference) strains of Mus musculus . Parental genome sequencing data were downloaded from publicly available databases (Cas genome sequence (EMBL-EBI: ERP000042); 129 genome sequence (SRA: SRX037820). In order to identify distinguishing SNPs, we first aligned whole genome sequencing reads of each strain to the mm10 genome with bowtie2 (v2.3.5.1), filtered multimapped reads (mapq < 10) with samtools (v1.7), and removed duplicates with GATK (v4.1.4.1) MarkDuplicates. For allelic analysis in Cas/129 F1 hybrid cells, we jointly called SNPs with the aligned Cas data and the aligned 129 data and filtered out low quality SNPs with bcftools (v1.8). For allelic analysis in Cas/B6 F1 hybrid cells, we called SNPs with the aligned Cas data alone and filtered out low quality SNPs with bcftools. SNPs were required to have a minimum depth of 5, with at least 90% of the reads supporting the alternate allele, a minimum of 3 reads supporting the alternate allele and no more than 2 reads supporting the reference allele. Indels and complex SNPs were not included. To filter the Cas/129 SNPs, SNPs that were alternate in both strains were excluded. When a SNP is alternate in one strain, the other strain must have fewer than 10% of reads supporting the alternate allele, at least 2 reads supporting the reference allele, and fewer than 2 reads supporting the alternate allele. The resulting Cas/129 and Cas/B6 variant call files (VCFs) were used in subsequent allelic analysis.
Cellranger count (v5.0.1) was used to align and process scRNA-seq reads to the mm10 genome with the option [–include-introns]. Seurat (v3.9.9.9024) in R (v3.6.1) to identify and exclude low quality cells, defined by a high percent of reads aligning to the mitochondrial genome (> 7%) or a low number of unique feature counts. As the feature count per cell is partially a function of read depth per library, the threshold used was based on the number of features in the bulk of the cells in each library and ranged between 1500 and 2000. Vartrix (v1.1.14) was used to identify and count reads with informative SNPs (allelic reads) with the options [–scoring-method coverage –umi]. Either the Cas/129 VCF or the Cas/B6 VCF described above were used, as appropriate for the strain. All subsequent analyses were done in R. Allelic reads from the X chromosome were summarized for each gene to generate Xi allelic reads ratio Xi/(Xi+Xa) per X-linked gene. Lowly expressed genes were filtered out, by requiring a minimum of 10 cells in each library to have at least one allelic read of that gene. Xi allelic ratios for each gene were calculated per cell, requiring a minimum of 3 allelic reads to get an Xi ratio for a given gene in a cell.
For scRNA-seq data of the female F1 2-1 Xist 129 WT / Cas WT or Xist 129 ΔB / Cas WT EpiLCs, cells with biallelic or undetectable Xist expression (< 3 allelic reads), and XO cells, were excluded, and the Xi was determined based on monoallelic Xist expression. Xi allelic ratios between WT 129 Xi and ΔΒ 129 Xi were compared using a one-sided welch t test (p < 0.05) with the R function t.test, where each cell is a replicate.
For the scRNA-seq data of TX1072 (B6 tetO-Xist Cas WT-Xist ) ESC lines expressing WT-SPEN-GFP, ΔIDR-SPEN-GFP, and ΔSPOC-SPEN-GFP at 0 h and 24 h of dox treatment, where Xist is induced by doxycycline from the B6 allele, XO cells were excluded. All cells were assumed to inactivate the B6 X chromosome. The Xi ratios between 0 and 24 h dox induction of Xist for the respective cell line were compared using a one-sided welch t test (p < 0.05) with the R function t.test, where each cell is a replicate.
The mean Xi allelic ratios per gene were found for each set of cells and plotted with ggplot2. Statistical tests comparing distributions were performed with the function stat_compare_means in the R package ggpubr. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for pairwise comparisons, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare multiple groups.
Reads were aligned to the mm10 genome with STAR (v2.7.1a), filtered multimapped reads (mapq < 10) with samtools (v1.7) and allelic ratios were found using GATK (v4.1.4.1) ASEReadCounter and the Cas/B6 VCF described above. Allelic reads were assigned to genes using bedtools intersect with all genes from the gencode mm10 annotation file (gencode.vM24.annotation.gtf). All subsequent analyses were done in R. Due to the tetO Xist promoter being on the B6 allele, the B6 X chromosome was inactivated in all cells. Allelic reads were summed across genes and the allelic reads ratio Xi/(Xi+Xa) were found. Genes with fewer than 10 reads with informative SNPs (allelic reads) were filtered out from each sample. Xi ratios between 0 h and 24 h dox were compared with a one-sided welch t test (p < 0.05) with the R function t.test, with 3 replicates per condition. The mean Xi allelic ratios per gene were found for each condition and plotted with ggplot2. Statistical tests comparing distributions were performed with the function stat_compare_means in the R package ggpubr. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for pairwise comparisons, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare multiple groups.
The silencing half-times of genes during XCI were downloaded from ( Barros de Andrade E. Sousa et al., 2019 3. Barros de Andrade E. Sousa, L. ∙ Jonkers, I. ∙ Syx, L. ... Kinetics of Xist -induced gene silencing can be predicted from combinations of epigenetic and genomic features Genome Res. 2019; 29 :1087-1099 Google Scholar ) and analyzed in R. X-linked genes with a half-time range of 0-0.4 days were classified as early-silencing genes, of 0.4–1 days as late-silencing genes, of 1-2 days as very late silencing genes, and > 2 days as escapee genes.
CLAP-seq libraries of FL, ΔΙDR and ΔRRM SPEN were aligned to the mm10 genome with STAR (v2.7.1a), filtered multimapped reads (mapq < 10) with samtools (v1.7), duplicate reads were removed with GATK (v4.1.4.1) MarkDuplicates. RPKM values were calculated for each sample in 100bp bins smoothed across 300bp with deeptools, only counting the forward strand in order to avoid double counting fragments, (v3.5.0) with the options [–normalizeUsing RPKM–binSize 100–samFlagInclude 64–skipNAs]. Enrichment was calculated in R by dividing SPEN pulldown RPKM over input RPKM in each bin. The R package ggplot2 was used to plot the enrichment scores.
To identify genes that were repressed by SPOC tethered to Xist in the absence of SPEN, we used previously published allele-specific RNA-seq count data from GSE131784 of TX1072 B6 tetO-Xist Cas WT-Xist ESC lines expressing SPEN-AID-GFP, where depletion of SPEN was rescued through tethering of BglG-GFP-SPOC or BglG-GFP (as a control) to tetO- Xist –Bgl stem–loop RNA via BglG ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ).
SPOC silencing values for each gene were calculated as described ( Dossin et al., 2020 31. Dossin, F. ∙ Pinheiro, I. ∙ Żylicz, J.J. ... SPEN integrates transcriptional and epigenetic control of X-inactivation Nature. 2020; 578 :455-460 Google Scholar ). Briefly, we filtered out genes that were skewed or not silenced under control conditions. We then calculated a silencing index under normal conditions (silencing_index DOX = 1 − (allelic_ratio DOX/ allelic_ratio control ) and after degrading SPEN and expressing SPOC tethered to Xist (silencing_index SPOC = 1 − (allelic_ratio SPOC /allelic_ratio control ). To quantify the silencing defect in cells expressing only Xist -tethered SPOC, we calculated the silencing defect (silencing_defect = 1 – (silencing_index SPOC /silencing_index DOX ). We calculated the silencing defects for the control BglG-GFP rescue identically. The silencing defect per gene was found for each condition and plotted with ggplot2. Statistical tests comparing distributions were performed with the function stat_compare_means in the R package ggpubr. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for pairwise comparisons, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare multiple groups.
To identify genes with a silencing defect as a result of the knockout of Smchd1 , we downloaded RNA-seq allelic counts from GSE99991 and classified genes as SMCHD1-sensitive or -insensitive following the previously analysis pipeline (Wang et al.). All analysis was performed in R. Briefly, the Xi allelic reads ratio Xi/(Xi+Xa) was determined per X-linked gene. Genes with fewer than 13 reads with informative SNPs (allelic reads), a skewed allelic ratio, or that escape X inactivation were filtered out. SMCHD1-sensitive genes were defined as having Xi allelic ratio in SMCHD1 knockout neural progenitor cells (NPCs) of 3-fold greater than Xi allelic ratio in WT NPCs. The silencing half-time from Barros de Andrade E. Sousa et al., (2019) 3. Barros de Andrade E. Sousa, L. ∙ Jonkers, I. ∙ Syx, L. ... Kinetics of Xist -induced gene silencing can be predicted from combinations of epigenetic and genomic features Genome Res. 2019; 29 :1087-1099 Google Scholar was plotted for SMCHD1-sensitive and -insensitive genes with the R package ggplot2, and distributions were compared with a Wilcoxon rank sum test using the function stat_compare_means from the R package ggpubr.
