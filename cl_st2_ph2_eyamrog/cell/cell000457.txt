Title: Parallel pathways for recruiting effector proteins determine centromere drive and suppression


Abstract: Summary

Selfish centromere DNA sequences bias their transmission to the egg in female meiosis. Evolutionary theory suggests that centromere proteins evolve to suppress costs of this “centromere drive.” In hybrid mouse models with genetically different maternal and paternal centromeres, selfish centromere DNA exploits a kinetochore pathway to recruit microtubule-destabilizing proteins that act as drive effectors. We show that such functional differences are suppressed by a parallel pathway for effector recruitment by heterochromatin, which is similar between centromeres in this system. Disrupting the kinetochore pathway with a divergent allele of CENP-C reduces functional differences between centromeres, whereas disrupting heterochromatin by CENP-B deletion amplifies the differences. Molecular evolution analyses using Murinae genomes identify adaptive evolution in proteins in both pathways. We propose that centromere proteins have recurrently evolved to minimize the kinetochore pathway, which is exploited by selfish DNA, relative to the heterochromatin pathway that equalizes centromeres, while maintaining essential functions.

Section: Introduction

Centromere evolution is paradoxical in that both repetitive centromere DNA and centromere-binding proteins evolve rapidly despite the conserved requirement of centromeres for faithful chromosome segregation ( Henikoff et al., 2001 34.

Repeat copy number also varies within species, for example, between human individuals or between mouse strains ( Iwata-Otsubo et al., 2017 40. Iwata-Otsubo, A. ∙ Dawicki-McKenna, J.M. ∙ Akera, T. ...

To explain this rapid evolution, the centromere drive hypothesis proposes that selfish centromere DNA sequences (either monomer sequence variants or repeat number expansions) drive in female meiosis by increasing their transmission rate to the egg. Potential deleterious consequences of driving centromeres, such as meiotic segregation errors, would select for centromere-binding protein variants that suppress these fitness costs ( Finseth et al., 2021 24.

New selfish DNA variants subsequently arise to start another cycle of drive and suppression in a continual evolutionary arms race.
Our previous work leveraged natural variation in mouse centromere DNA to study the molecular mechanisms of centromere drive ( Akera et al., 2017 3. Akera, T. ∙ Chmátal, L. ∙ Trimm, E. ...

Biol. 2017; 27 :2365-2373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Selfish centromeres in these model systems recruit more effector proteins that preferentially destabilize interactions with tyrosinated microtubules on the cortical side of an asymmetric meiosis I spindle, allowing them to detach from microtubules that would otherwise direct them to the polar body. Microtubule detachment and reattachment reorients the selfish centromeres toward the egg side of the spindle ( Akera et al., 2017 3. Akera, T. ∙ Chmátal, L. ∙ Trimm, E. ... Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation Science. 2017; 358 :668-672 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 4.

This reorientation depends on BUB1 kinase at kinetochores, which phosphorylates pericentromeric histone H2A. Phosphorylated H2A recruits Shugoshin-2 (SGO2), which recruits microtubule destabilizing proteins such as MCAK and the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) ( Akera et al., 2019 4. Akera, T. ∙ Trimm, E. ∙ Lampson, M.A. Molecular strategies of meiotic cheating by selfish centromeres Cell. 2019; 178 :1132-1144 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B, kinetochore pathway). In one intra-species Mus musculus domesticus hybrid, selfish centromeres with expanded minor satellite DNA repeats assemble more centromere chromatin containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A ( Iwata-Otsubo et al., 2017 40. Iwata-Otsubo, A. ∙ Dawicki-McKenna, J.M. ∙ Akera, T. ... Expanded satellite repeats amplify a discrete CENP-A nucleosome assembly site on chromosomes that drive in female meiosis Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :2365-2373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). These expanded centromeres also form larger kinetochores with more BUB1 kinase, leading to more effectors (inner centromere proteins such as SGO2, CPC, and MCAK) ( Akera et al., 2019 4. Akera, T. ∙ Trimm, E. ∙ Lampson, M.A. Molecular strategies of meiotic cheating by selfish centromeres Cell. 2019; 178 :1132-1144 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this hybrid, the larger centromeres are from a standard laboratory strain (either CF-1 or C57BL/6J), which is crossed to a wild-derived strain (CHPO) with smaller centromeres. Thus, the centromeres of paired homologous chromosomes within a meiotic bivalent are both genetically and functionally different in the hybrid ( Figure 1 C). These findings show how selfish centromeres can drive by recruiting more effectors. How centromere-binding proteins can evolve to suppress the costs of drive remains an open question despite being a crucial component of the centromere drive model. Details of the fitness costs are unclear, but they likely depend on functional differences between paired centromeres in meiosis and would therefore be suppressed by reducing these differences.

Section: Results

Based on our finding that selfish centromeres drive by recruiting more effectors, we propose that functional differences between centromeres can be suppressed by equalizing effector recruitment via a second pathway. This equalization would render genetically different centromeres functionally equivalent. This model incorporates previous findings that in addition to the kinetochore pathway, which acts through BUB1 kinase, effectors are also recruited through a heterochromatin pathway. Pericentromeric heterochromatin recruits the CPC, which recruits SGO2 and MCAK ( Figure 1 B, heterochromatin pathway) ( Abe et al., 2016 1. Abe, Y. ∙ Sako, K. ∙ Takagaki, K. ...

Cell. Biol. 2015; 35 :634-648 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our CHPO hybrid model system ( Figure 1 C), the kinetochore pathway is asymmetric: we observe higher levels of the kinetochore proteins HEC1/NDC80 and CENP-C on larger versus smaller centromeres ( Chmátal et al., 2014 13. Chmátal, L. ∙ Gabriel, S.I. ∙ Mitsainas, G.P. ... Centromere strength provides the cell biological basis for meiotic drive and karyotype evolution in mice Curr.

Expanded satellite repeats amplify a discrete CENP-A nucleosome assembly site on chromosomes that drive in female meiosis Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :2365-2373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the heterochromatin pathway is symmetric: the heterochromatin mark, H3K9me3, is equal on the two sides of each bivalent ( Figure 1 D and 1E) ( Iwata-Otsubo et al., 2017 40. Iwata-Otsubo, A. ∙ Dawicki-McKenna, J.M. ∙ Akera, T. ... Expanded satellite repeats amplify a discrete CENP-A nucleosome assembly site on chromosomes that drive in female meiosis Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :2365-2373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations suggest that, in this system, selfish centromere DNA exploits the kinetochore pathway to make genetically different centromeres also functionally different, with larger centromeres recruiting more effectors. In contrast, the heterochromatin pathway appears insensitive to selfish DNA, recruiting effectors equally. We propose that centromere protein evolution suppresses functional differences by minimizing the contribution of the asymmetric kinetochore pathway to effector recruitment, relative to the symmetric heterochromatin pathway.
Evolution of the kinetochore pathway is constrained by its indispensable role in mitotic and meiotic chromosome segregation. Nevertheless, proteins may evolve to weaken the pathway by reducing interactions between centromere-binding proteins and DNA or between proteins leading to effector recruitment ( Figure 1 F). Similarly, evolution of heterochromatin proteins is constrained by numerous vital heterochromatin-dependent cellular functions ( Allshire and Madhani, 2018 5. Allshire, R.C. ∙ Madhani, H.D. Ten principles of heterochromatin formation and function Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :229-244 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inner centromere proteins (such as the CPC) that interact with heterochromatin may evolve, however, to increase effector recruitment. Finally, overall effector levels are also constrained because microtubule destabilizing activity is necessary to correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors, but excessive destabilizing activity weakens attachments necessary for anaphase segregation and activates the spindle assembly checkpoint ( Godek et al., 2015 31. Godek, K.M. ∙ Kabeche, L. ∙ Compton, D.A. Regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments through homeostatic control during mitosis Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 :57-64 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). According to our parallel pathway model, a new centromere DNA variant can exploit the kinetochore pathway to recruit more effectors by strengthening interactions with any centromere-binding protein that contacts the DNA: CENP-A, the CENP-A chromatin assembly machinery, or other proteins that link centromere chromatin to the kinetochore (e.g., CENP-C or CENP-T). To suppress functional differences between centromeres, the centromere protein network recurrently evolves to minimize the kinetochore pathway relative to the heterochromatin pathway while maintaining essential functions.
Here, we test three predictions from the parallel pathway model. First, when the asymmetric kinetochore pathway is weakened, we predict that centromeres become functionally more similar due to the symmetric heterochromatin pathway. We selected CENP-C as a key scaffold protein in the kinetochore pathway that is known to evolve rapidly under positive selection ( Klare et al., 2015 52. Klare, K. ∙ Weir, J.R. ∙ Basilico, F. ... CENP-C is a blueprint for constitutive centromere-associated network assembly within human kinetochores J. Cell Biol. 2015; 210 :11-22 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Schueler et al., 2010 85. Schueler, M.G. ∙ Swanson, W. ∙ Thomas, P.J. ..., NISC Comparative Sequencing Program Adaptive evolution of foundation kinetochore proteins in primates Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27 :1585-1597 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Talbert et al., 2004 93. Talbert, P.B. ∙ Bryson, T.D. ∙ Henikoff, S. Adaptive evolution of centromere proteins in plants and animals J. Biol. 2004; 3 :18 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Under the parallel pathway model, CENP-C interfaces have co-evolved with interacting partners to modulate effector recruitment. Thus, introducing a divergent allele of CENP-C in mouse cells (e.g., rat CENP-C, in which 32% of the amino acid sequence is different) is predicted to disrupt such interactions and weaken the kinetochore pathway ( Figure 1 G). Second, when the symmetric heterochromatin pathway is weakened, we predict that the asymmetric kinetochore pathway makes a relatively larger contribution to effector recruitment. Genetically different centromeres in our hybrid model system should therefore become functionally more different. To target pericentromeric heterochromatin, we deleted CENP-B, which is the only centromeric chromatin component that is dispensable for core centromere function. CENP-B is recently acquired in mammals and fission yeast from a pogo-like transposase ( Casola et al., 2008 9. Casola, C. ∙ Hucks, D. ∙ Feschotte, C.

In mouse and human cultured cells and fission yeast, CENP-B contributes to pericentromeric heterochromatin formation via heterochromatin protein recruitment ( Nakagawa et al., 2002 67.

Cell Sci. 2020; 133 :jcs243303 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), so deleting CENP-B should weaken the heterochromatin pathway ( Figure 1 H). Mammalian CENP-B can also contribute to the kinetochore pathway via CENP-C recruitment ( Fachinetti et al., 2015 22. Fachinetti, D. ∙ Han, J.S. ∙ McMahon, M.A. ... DNA sequence-specific binding of CENP-B enhances the fidelity of human centromere function Dev. Cell. 2015; 33 :314-327 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), so the functional consequences of CENP-B deletion in our model need to be tested. Third, if proteins in the kinetochore and heterochromatin pathways have evolved to modulate effector recruitment, we predict signatures of positive selection in multiple protein domains involved in effector recruitment. In contrast, the previous model of an arms race limited to interactions between centromere DNA and DNA-binding proteins only predicts rapid evolution of protein domains involved in DNA binding ( Henikoff et al., 2001 34. Henikoff, S. ∙ Ahmad, K. ∙ Malik, H.S. The centromere paradox: stable inheritance with rapidly evolving DNA Science. 2001; 293 :1098-1102 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ; Malik and Henikoff, 2001 58. Malik, H.S. ∙ Henikoff, S. Adaptive evolution of Cid, a centromere-specific histone in Drosophila Genetics. 2001; 157 :1293-1298 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Our observations are consistent with all three predictions, supporting our parallel pathway model for drive and suppression.
To weaken the kinetochore pathway, we targeted CENP-C because it serves as a hub for recruiting kinetochore proteins. Our model predicts that CENP-C has co-evolved with interacting partners to modulate effector recruitment, so that an allele from another species will disrupt these interactions and weaken the kinetochore pathway ( Figure 1 G, prediction 1). To test this prediction, we selected divergent alleles from rat and from the African striped mouse Rhabdomys pumilio as model organisms close to mouse with divergent centromere DNA and proteins ( Figure 2 A) ( Cazaux et al., 2013 10. Cazaux, B. ∙ Catalan, J. ∙ Justy, F. ...

Res. 2013; 755 :73-80 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because protein interfaces change by genetic drift as well as by selection, alleles from closely related species minimize incompatibilities coming from stochastic changes. We introduced GFP-tagged divergent alleles (or the mouse allele as a control) into mouse oocytes in the presence of endogenous CENP-C ( Figures S1 A and S1B). We find that rat CENP-C expression reduces effector recruitment, as represented by SGO2 staining, compared to mouse CENP-C expression ( Figure 2 B). This result is consistent with our model prediction and could reflect differences between mouse and rat CENP-C in their recruitment to centromeres or in their interactions with other kinetochore proteins. For example, evolution at an interface with CENP-A nucleosomes or with CENP-B may disrupt rat CENP-C recruitment to centromeres. Alternatively, CENP-C evolution might impact the domains that mediate interactions with other kinetochore proteins involved in SGO2 recruitment. We find that mouse and rat CENP-C are equally recruited and incorporated into mouse centromeres ( Figure 2 C and Figures S1 C–S1E), indicating functional changes at an interface with other kinetochore proteins.
In contrast to our results with rat CENP-C, R. pumilio CENP-C is recruited at higher levels to mouse centromeres compared to mouse CENP-C ( Figure 2 D), with similar expression levels as measured by cytoplasmic GFP ( Figure S1 F). Consistent with this result, effector recruitment is also increased in cells expressing R. pumilio CENP-C ( Figure 2 E). Together, these findings show that different CENP-C interfaces, with centromere chromatin or with other kinetochore proteins, have changed through rodent evolution to modulate effector recruitment ( Figure 2 F). Furthermore, differences between R. pumilio and mouse CENP-C localization to mouse centromeres suggest that mouse CENP-C has evolved to weaken its interactions with centromere chromatin.
Rat CENP-C expression provides an experimental tool to specifically weaken the kinetochore pathway, without affecting heterochromatin ( Figure 2 G; Figure S1 G), allowing us to test our prediction that genetically different centromeres become functionally more similar in our hybrid model system ( Figure 1 G, prediction 2). As a functional readout of centromere asymmetry, we analyzed chromosome position on the spindle at metaphase I ( Figure 2 H; Figures S2 A and S2B). Chromosome position is sensitive to differences in interactions with spindle microtubules between centromeres of homologous chromosomes, which are paired in a meiotic bivalent. If the paired centromeres are genetically and functionally similar, then chromosomes align at the spindle equator in a typical metaphase configuration. In our CHPO hybrid model systems, paired centromeres are genetically and functionally different, and bivalents are positioned off-center on the spindle, with the larger centromere closer to its attached pole ( Akera et al., 2019 4. Akera, T. ∙ Trimm, E. ∙ Lampson, M.A. Molecular strategies of meiotic cheating by selfish centromeres Cell. 2019; 178 :1132-1144 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chmátal et al., 2014 13. Chmátal, L. ∙ Gabriel, S.I. ∙ Mitsainas, G.P. ... Centromere strength provides the cell biological basis for meiotic drive and karyotype evolution in mice Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :2295-2300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Manipulations that make these genetically different centromeres functionally more similar will lead to positioning closer to the spindle equator, as previously shown by manipulating BUB1 kinase to equalize MCAK levels on larger and smaller centromeres ( Akera et al., 2019 4. Akera, T. ∙ Trimm, E. ∙ Lampson, M.A. Molecular strategies of meiotic cheating by selfish centromeres Cell. 2019; 178 :1132-1144 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, manipulations that make the centromeres functionally more different will position bivalents closer to the poles. We find that expression of rat CENP-C in CHPO hybrid oocytes ( Figure 1 C) leads to bivalents positioned closer to the spindle equator ( Figure 2 I), without affecting meiotic progression ( Figure S2 C). This result indicates that the paired larger and smaller centromeres are functionally more similar, consistent with the prediction that the symmetric heterochromatin pathway becomes relatively more dominant when the asymmetric kinetochore pathway is weakened ( Figure 1 G, prediction 2). We also tested R. pumilio CENP-C expression but did not find changes in chromosome position ( Figure S1 H), suggesting that the modest increase in effector recruitment ( Figure 2 E) does not impact microtubule destabilizing activity enough to be detected in our assay.
To determine the contribution of CENP-B to effector recruitment, we created Cenpb -null mice using CRISPR genome editing ( Figures S3 A–S3C). We find that loss of CENP-B weakens both the kinetochore and heterochromatin pathways, as shown by reduced CENP-C and H3K9me3 staining, respectively ( Figure 3 A). These results are consistent with previous findings that CENP-B contributes to CENP-C recruitment and to formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin ( Fachinetti et al., 2015 22. Fachinetti, D. ∙ Han, J.S. ∙ McMahon, M.A. ... DNA sequence-specific binding of CENP-B enhances the fidelity of human centromere function Dev.

Otake, K. ∙ Ohzeki, J.-I. ∙ Shono, N. ... CENP-B creates alternative epigenetic chromatin states permissive for CENP-A or heterochromatin assembly J. Cell Sci. 2020; 133 :jcs243303 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We also find reduced effector recruitment, as represented by SGO2 staining ( Figure 3 A), consistent with the idea that CENP-B recruits effectors through the kinetochore and heterochromatin pathways.
The known functions of CENP-B suggest two hypotheses for how it might affect centromeres in our CHPO hybrid model system. First, as the only centromere protein known to recognize a specific DNA sequence (the CENP-B box in repetitive centromere DNA) ( Masumoto et al., 1989 62. Masumoto, H. ∙ Masukata, H. ∙ Muro, Y. ... A human centromere antigen (CENP-B) interacts with a short specific sequence in alphoid DNA, a human centromeric satellite J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109 :1963-1973 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), CENP-B could be exploited by selfish larger centromeres with more CENP-B boxes to increase asymmetry via the kinetochore pathway. Second, CENP-B may suppress functional differences between centromeres by increasing the symmetric heterochromatin pathway. To test these hypotheses, we generated Cenpb -null mice with paired larger and smaller centromeres through two generations of crosses ( Figure 3 B), and analyzed kinetochore pathway asymmetry and functional differences between centromeres. Due to technical limitations ( Figure S3 D), we were unable to measure transmission bias in these animals. To determine the impact of CENP-B on the kinetochore pathway, we analyzed CENP-C in meiotic bivalents with paired larger and smaller centromeres in second-generation hybrid Cenpb −/− oocytes. CENP-C was reduced to a similar extent on both larger and smaller centromeres ( Figure S3 E), and, consistent with this equivalent reduction, the kinetochore asymmetry remained intact ( Figure 3 C). Therefore, CENP-B does not contribute to asymmetry in the kinetochore pathway, arguing against the first hypothesis that selfish centromere DNA exploits the kinetochore pathway via CENP-B.
To test the second hypothesis, that CENP-B acts as a suppressor through the symmetric heterochromatin pathway ( Figure 1 H), we examined functional differences between centromeres in second-generation hybrid oocytes, using the chromosome position assay ( Figure 2 H). We find that asymmetric bivalents with genetically different centromeres are positioned more off-center, closer to the spindle poles, in Cenpb −/− compared to control Cenpb +/− oocytes ( Figure 3 D). In contrast, we find no effect on positioning of symmetric bivalents with genetically identical centromeres in the same cells, and meiotic progression is similar in control and Cenpb −/− oocytes ( Figure S2 D). Together these findings indicate that positioning of asymmetric bivalents closer to spindle poles in Cenpb −/− oocytes is due to increased functional differences between paired centromeres. This result is opposite to the result for rat CENP-C expression, which specifically weakens the kinetochore pathway ( Figures 2 B and 2G) and reduces functional asymmetry ( Figure 2 I). Therefore, although CENP-B deletion also weakens the kinetochore pathway, the dominant effect is to weaken a different pathway that equalizes centromeres, leading to increased functional asymmetry. Several lines of evidence indicate that this equalization pathway acts through heterochromatin: CENP-B is an established regulator of heterochromatin ( Nakagawa et al., 2002 67.

It is also possible, however, that CENP-B equalizes centromeres through an uncharacterized pathway independent of kinetochore assembly and heterochromatin.
The original model of centromere drive and suppression posits an arms race between selfish centromere DNA and DNA-binding proteins such as CENP-A ( Henikoff et al., 2001 34. Henikoff, S. ∙ Ahmad, K. ∙ Malik, H.S. The centromere paradox: stable inheritance with rapidly evolving DNA Science. 2001; 293 :1098-1102 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ; Malik and Henikoff, 2001 58. Malik, H.S. ∙ Henikoff, S. Adaptive evolution of Cid, a centromere-specific histone in Drosophila Genetics. 2001; 157 :1293-1298 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This model predicts adaptive evolution of centromere protein domains that physically interact with DNA, and conservation of domains and other centromere proteins that do not bind DNA. In contrast, our parallel pathway model predicts signatures of recurrent adaptive evolution in protein domains leading to effector recruitment, including those that do not directly contact centromere DNA ( Figure 4 A). These changes could either weaken the kinetochore pathway or strengthen the heterochromatin pathway to make genetically different centromeres functionally more similar ( Figure 1 F). Rapid evolution of centromere proteins has been reported in several eukaryotic lineages, but there are no mechanistic studies of drive in these lineages ( Finseth et al., 2015 23. Finseth, F.R. ∙ Dong, Y. ∙ Saunders, A. ... Duplication and adaptive evolution of a key centromeric protein in Mimulus, a genus with female meiotic drive Mol. Biol.

Genome-scale detection of positive selection in nine primates predicts human-virus evolutionary conflicts Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :10634-10648 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). To analyze centromere protein evolution in a system where we have identified drive effectors, we tested for signatures of positive selection in Murinae. Because the sparseness of the phylogenetic tree of currently available Murinae genomes limits our statistical power to detect positive selection, we sequenced six additional genomes ( Figure 4 B) using linked-read whole-genome sequencing (10x Genomics). Each genome was assembled onto the Mus musculus reference genome (mm10) with LongRanger and de novo assembled with Supernova (see STAR Methods and Table S1 ). Sampling evolutionary time more comprehensively increases our opportunities to observe adaptive changes (and minimize false positives from stochastic changes by genetic drift), especially those adaptive changes that are common to multiple independent lineages. Thus, these genomes provide a valuable resource for molecular evolution approaches in mouse as a mammalian model organism, such as our analyses of centromere proteins discussed below.
Low rates of nonsynonymous substitutions, which change the encoded amino acid, relative to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) indicate purifying selection, as deleterious substitutions are selected against. Higher dN/dS indicates either adaptive evolution or loss of constraint, necessitating further analysis to identify signatures of positive selection ( Echave et al., 2016 20. Echave, J. ∙ Spielman, S.J. ∙ Wilke, C.O. Causes of evolutionary rate variation among protein sites Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :109-121 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sironi et al., 2015 88. Sironi, M. ∙ Cagliani, R. ∙ Forni, D. ... Evolutionary insights into host-pathogen interactions from mammalian sequence data Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16 :224-236 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). We calculated dN/dS for all annotated mouse-rat orthologous genes. We find that multiple genes encoding centromere proteins have high dN/dS relative to the genome overall ( Figure 4 C), and the average dN/dS for these genes is significantly higher than for any other subcellular compartment ( Figure 4 D). We selected 46 genes with well-characterized centromere functions to analyze for signatures of positive selection based on phylogenetic analysis, using PAML ( Yang, 2007 104. Yang, Z. PAML 4: phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24 :1586-1591 Crossref Scopus (7094) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with our prediction, we find such signatures at multiple genes in the kinetochore and heterochromatin pathways ( Figure 4 E).
Extensive previous studies of centromere organization and function have established functional modules, which can recruit drive effectors either directly or indirectly ( Figure 4 A). To fit our observations into this framework, we assigned genes to these modules ( Figure S4 ). One module is CENP-A chromatin. Selfish centromere DNA can increase effector recruitment by expanding CENP-A chromatin through increased deposition of CENP-A nucleosomes. This process depends on a specialized histone chaperone, HJURP, which is targeted to centromeres by the MIS18 complex though interactions with CENP-C or CENP-I ( Dunleavy et al., 2009 19. Dunleavy, E.M. ∙ Roche, D. ∙ Tagami, H. ...

We find rapid evolution of HJURP, MIS18BP1, CENP-I, and the domain of CENP-C that interacts with the MIS18 complex ( Figures 4 E and 5 A). In contrast, heterochromatin proteins such as HP1 paralogs and SUV39H1, which are not specific to centromeres/pericentromeres, are highly conserved ( Table S2 ), consistent with the idea that heterochromatin broadly suppresses selfish genetic elements regardless of the underlying DNA sequence ( Allshire and Madhani, 2018 5. Allshire, R.C. ∙ Madhani, H.D. Ten principles of heterochromatin formation and function Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :229-244 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggest that selection acts on the CENP-A chromatin assembly pathway to prevent expansion, but selfish centromere DNA does not exploit the heterochromatin pathway, consistent with our observation that genetically different centromeres have symmetric heterochromatin in our intra-species and inter-species hybrids ( Figure 1 D; our unpublished data).
Under our model ( Figure 1 B), selfish centromere DNA can also recruit more effectors through the kinetochore pathway by strengthening direct interactions with CENP-A or with the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), leading to larger kinetochores and more BUB1 kinase. Proteins can subsequently adapt by weakening interactions either with DNA or with other kinetochore proteins ( Figure 4 A, DNA interface and kinetochore assembly). Within the CCAN, CENP-C and CENP-T connect CENP-A chromatin to kinetochore proteins. The middle part of CENP-C interacts with CENP-A nucleosomes, while the N terminus interacts with the MIS12 kinetochore complex ( Petrovic et al., 2016 80. Petrovic, A. ∙ Keller, J. ∙ Liu, Y. ...

Weir, J.R. ∙ Faesen, A.C. ∙ Klare, K. ... Insights from biochemical reconstitution into the architecture of human kinetochores Nature. 2016; 537 :249-253 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the CENP-TWSX nucleosome-like complex contacts centromere DNA, and the other end of CENP-T interact with MIS12 and NDC80 kinetochore complexes ( Cortes-Silva et al., 2020 15.

Consistent with our model, we detect signatures of positive selection in the chromatin-interacting domains and the kinetochore-interacting domains of both CENP-C and CENP-T ( Figures 5 A and 5B). In contrast, the DNA-interacting domain of CENP-B is conserved, consistent with our finding that selfish centromere DNA does not exploit CENP-B. Unlike in other eukaryotic lineages such as monkeyflower, fly, and primates ( Finseth et al., 2015 23. Finseth, F.R. ∙ Dong, Y. ∙ Saunders, A. ...

Diversification of the CENP-A N-terminal tail is also observed in plants, where crosses between strains expressing different alleles exhibit zygotic segregation errors and genome elimination ( Maheshwari et al., 2015 57. Maheshwari, S. ∙ Tan, E.H. ∙ West, A. ... Naturally occurring differences in CENH3 affect chromosome segregation in zygotic mitosis of hybrids PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1004970 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In the kinetochore module, proteins can adapt to weaken the kinetochore pathway by reducing either kinetochore assembly or BUB1 binding to the kinetochore ( Figure 4 A). We find rapid evolution of the kinetochore proteins DSN1, KNL1, and NDC80. DSN1 is a component of the MIS12 complex, which assembles onto the CCAN and serves as a platform for binding KNL1 and the NDC80 complex ( Petrovic et al., 2014 79. Petrovic, A. ∙ Mosalaganti, S. ∙ Keller, J. ... Modular assembly of RWD domains on the Mis12 complex underlies outer kinetochore organization Mol. Cell. 2014; 53 :591-605 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). KNL1 contains multiple protein docking motifs, including repeated MELT motifs that recruit BUB1 kinase ( Musacchio and Desai, 2017 66. Musacchio, A. ∙ Desai, A. A molecular view of kinetochore assembly and function Biology (Basel). 2017; 6 :5 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, changes in DSN1 and KNL1 can regulate kinetochore assembly and BUB1 recruitment. Consistent with the possibility that these interfaces evolve to modulate effector recruitment, we find signatures of positive selection in the MELT motifs of KNL1 ( Figure 5 C). NDC80 is the major microtubule binding protein in the kinetochore, but we find signatures of positive selection in the coiled-coil domain and not in the microtubule interacting domain. The coiled-coil domain recruits the SKA complex, which stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachment ( Huis In ’t Veld et al., 2019 39. Huis In ’t Veld, P.J. ∙ Volkov, V.A. ∙ Stender, I.D. ... Molecular determinants of the Ska-Ndc80 interaction and their influence on microtubule tracking and force-coupling eLife. 2019; 8 :e49539 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) and could be involved in counteracting destabilizing activities exploited by selfish centromeres.
Although selfish centromere DNA is likely unable to exploit heterochromatin to drive, inner centromere proteins can adapt to increase effector recruitment through the heterochromatin pathway relative to the kinetochore pathway in our model. In the inner centromere module ( Figure 4 A), INCENP is a scaffold component of the CPC that interacts directly with heterochromatin and indirectly with SGO1/2 ( Abe et al., 2016 1.

Yamagishi, Y. ∙ Honda, T. ∙ Tanno, Y. ... Two histone marks establish the inner centromere and chromosome bi-orientation Science. 2010; 330 :239-243 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ). The catalytic component of the CPC is Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates kinetochore substrates to destabilize microtubule interactions and is thus a potential drive effector. We find that positive selection shapes the domains of INCENP that interact with Borealin/Survivin, with HP1, and with Aurora B ( Figure 5 D), suggesting that INCENP can adapt to selfish centromere DNA by modulating its localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin and ultimately the recruitment of SGO1/2 and Aurora B. Furthermore, we find rapid evolution of SGO2, suggesting that it can also tune the relative strength of the two pathways through mutations that modulate its recruitment by either pathway. In comparison, SGO1 is a paralog of SGO2 that does not recruit MCAK ( Yao and Dai, 2012 106. Yao, Y. ∙ Dai, W. Shugoshins function as a guardian for chromosomal stability in nuclear division Cell Cycle. 2012; 11 :2631-2642 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and does not have signatures of positive selection, suggesting that evolutionary pressure to regulate MCAK recruitment shapes SGO2 evolution. Overall, our molecular evolution analyses show signatures of positive selection in both the kinetochore and heterochromatin pathways. We find these changes both in domains that interact directly with DNA and in protein-protein interaction domains leading to recruitment of drive effectors. These results are consistent with our parallel pathway model for drive and suppression, but not with a simpler model of an arms race limited to centromere DNA and DNA binding proteins.

Section: Discussion

Here, we propose a parallel pathway model for drive and suppression of selfish centromeres: centromere DNA can exploit the kinetochore pathway to increase effector recruitment, and centromere protein evolution can make centromeres functionally equivalent by minimizing the contribution of the kinetochore pathway relative to the heterochromatin pathway ( Figure 6 A). This model predicts that disruption of either pathway will reduce effector (e.g., SGO2) recruitment, but the functional consequences will depend on which pathway is affected. Centromeres become either functionally more similar if the asymmetric kinetochore pathway is weakened, or more different if the symmetric heterochromatin pathway is weakened. In our experiments, either introduction of a divergent allele of CENP-C or deletion of CENP-B leads to SGO2 reduction to a similar extent ( Figures 2 B and 3 A). However, genetically different centromeres in CHPO hybrid oocytes become functionally more similar when rat CENP-C is expressed ( Figure 2 I), whereas they become functionally more different when CENP-B is deleted ( Figure 3 D). The CENP-C results are consistent with our model prediction that natural selection has acted on CENP-C interfaces involved in effector recruitment, so a divergent rat CENP-C interacts less well with mouse binding partners in the kinetochore pathway. Therefore, expression of rat CENP-C weakens the asymmetric kinetochore pathway, making the symmetric heterochromatin pathway relatively more dominant. In contrast, CENP-B deletion weakens the symmetric heterochromatin pathway, as shown by reduced H3K9me3, making the asymmetric kinetochore pathway more dominant. Loss of CENP-B also reduces CENP-C recruitment but does not affect the asymmetry between larger and smaller centromeres ( Figure 3 C).
Our molecular evolution analyses show adaptive evolution in multiple centromere proteins and in specific domains that interact with CENP-A chromatin or with other proteins leading to effector recruitment ( Figures 4 and 5 ). The previous model of a molecular arms race limited to interactions between centromere DNA and DNA-interacting proteins (such as CENP-A) ( Henikoff et al., 2001 34. Henikoff, S. ∙ Ahmad, K. ∙ Malik, H.S. The centromere paradox: stable inheritance with rapidly evolving DNA Science. 2001; 293 :1098-1102 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ) does not explain the more widespread recurrent evolution of centromere proteins. An alternative explanation, independent of centromere drive, is that the selective pressure may be related to non-centromere functions. For example, kinetochore proteins are repurposed for neural development in fly and worm ( Cheerambathur et al., 2019 11. Cheerambathur, D.K. ∙ Prevo, B. ∙ Chow, T.-L. ...

Kinetochore proteins have a post-mitotic function in neurodevelopment Dev. Cell. 2019; 48 :873-882 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), and KNL1 (also known as CASC5) is implicated in human brain size regulation ( Omer Javed et al., 2018 72.

Genet. 2017; 136 :193-204 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, such non-centromere functions have not been identified more broadly in eukaryotes. In contrast, our parallel pathway model predicts recurrent evolution of proteins in both pathways to equalize centromeres by weakening the kinetochore pathway or strengthening the heterochromatin pathway. In our model, selfish centromere DNA evolves to exploit the kinetochore pathway by recruiting more of a protein that ultimately recruits effectors. To suppress functional differences between centromeres, proteins in the kinetochore pathway can adapt to minimize the impact of selfish centromere DNA on kinetochore formation or effector recruitment. Indeed, our findings with R. pumilio CENP-C indicate that mouse CENP-C is not optimized for maximum binding to mouse centromeres, effectively weakening the kinetochore pathway ( Figure 2 D). Furthermore, proteins in the heterochromatin pathway such as CENP-B can adapt to increase effector recruitment equally at all centromeres, or INCENP and SGO2 can adapt by modulating their recruitment by either pathway ( Figure 6 A). The acidic domain of CENP-B is implicated in recruiting heterochromatin proteins ( Otake et al., 2020 73. Otake, K. ∙ Ohzeki, J.-I. ∙ Shono, N. ... CENP-B creates alternative epigenetic chromatin states permissive for CENP-A or heterochromatin assembly J. Cell Sci. 2020; 133 :jcs243303 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and the number of negatively charged amino acids in this domain is recurrently changed in mammals ( Figures S5 B and S5C). Although these changes are not analyzed in PAML, they suggest that CENP-B may have evolved to regulate pericentromeric heterochromatin. Overall, a protein network for effector recruitment can adapt to minimize asymmetric recruitment by selfish centromere DNA, while maintaining essential functions of the kinetochore and of microtubule destabilizing factors for accurate chromosome segregation.
Our results suggest an explanation for the conservation of CENP-B in mammals, as well as the presence of its binding sequence, the CENP-B box, at most mammalian centromeres with the notable exception of the Y chromosome. Although CENP-B is the only centromere protein known to bind a specific DNA sequence in mammals, neither the protein nor the binding sequence is essential for centromere function ( Amor et al., 2004 7.

Biol. 1998; 201 :135-143 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that CENP-B is conserved because it suppresses functional differences between centromeres by strengthening the heterochromatin pathway ( Figure 6 B), consistent with a more general function of heterochromatin in suppressing many selfish genetic elements ( Allshire and Madhani, 2018 5. Allshire, R.C. ∙ Madhani, H.D. Ten principles of heterochromatin formation and function Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :229-244 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). This CENP-B function is important only when centromeres of homologous chromosomes are different, which would frequently occur in outbred populations. Loss of CENP-B therefore increases functional difference between larger and smaller centromeres in our hybrid model but does not significantly impair fertility or viability in inbred laboratory strains ( Hudson et al., 1998 36. Hudson, D.F. ∙ Fowler, K.J. ∙ Earle, E. ... Centromere protein B null mice are mitotically and meiotically normal but have lower body and testis weights J.

Biol. 1998; 201 :135-143 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). A potential cost of increasing heterochromatin, however, is that its invasion into CENP-A chromatin disrupts centromere function ( Ohzeki et al., 2016 70. Ohzeki, J. ∙ Shono, N. ∙ Otake, K. ... KAT7/HBO1/MYST2 regulates CENP-A chromatin assembly by antagonizing Suv39h1-mediated centromere inactivation Dev. Cell. 2016; 37 :413-427 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore propose that mammalian CENP-B has acquired an additional function to maintain CENP-A chromatin, by recruiting CENP-C and CENP-A chromatin regulators ( Fachinetti et al., 2015 22. Fachinetti, D. ∙ Han, J.S. ∙ McMahon, M.A. ... DNA sequence-specific binding of CENP-B enhances the fidelity of human centromere function Dev.

CENP-B creates alternative epigenetic chromatin states permissive for CENP-A or heterochromatin assembly J. Cell Sci. 2020; 133 :jcs243303 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 B). Consistent with this idea, CENP-A chromatin is reduced in Cenpb -null oocytes ( Figure S3 F). By regulating both CENP-A chromatin and heterochromatin, alternative functions of CENP-B in different chromatin environments may suppress functional differences between centromeres through heterochromatin while maintaining centromere function. CENP-B can suppress differences between centromeres only if its functions are insensitive to expansion of the number of CENP-B binding sites; otherwise, it would contribute to higher levels of effector recruitment by DNA repeat expansions. Indeed, we find that CENP-B does not contribute to asymmetry in CENP-C recruitment between larger and smaller centromeres ( Figure 3 C), despite 6- to 10-fold differences in minor satellite sequences containing CENP-B boxes ( Iwata-Otsubo et al., 2017 40. Iwata-Otsubo, A. ∙ Dawicki-McKenna, J.M. ∙ Akera, T. ... Expanded satellite repeats amplify a discrete CENP-A nucleosome assembly site on chromosomes that drive in female meiosis Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :2365-2373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). This result suggests that CENP-B recruits CENP-C only within the CENP-A chromatin domain, so that CENP-B binding outside of this domain does not strengthen the kinetochore pathway. Furthermore, the heterochromatin symmetry between larger and smaller centromeres ( Figure 1 D) suggests that although CENP-B contributes to initiating heterochromatin formation, for example by recruiting an H3K9 methyltransferase, heterochromatin spreading does not depend on the number of CENP-B boxes. Initiation of heterochromatin propagation is a common mechanism to regulate heterochromatin formation, as in the example of X inactivation where XIST initiates heterochromatinization of the entire chromosome ( Allshire and Madhani, 2018 5. Allshire, R.C. ∙ Madhani, H.D. Ten principles of heterochromatin formation and function Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :229-244 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, CENP-B functions in CENP-A chromatin and heterochromatin are insensitive to repeat expansion. A centromere variant completely lacking CENP-B boxes, however, will lose to an existing centromere in female meiosis because it will recruit fewer effectors by both the kinetochore and heterochromatin pathways. Therefore, CENP-B boxes are maintained at most centromeres ( Figure 6 A), but this selective pressure does not affect the Y chromosome, which never experiences female meiosis and does not bind CENP-B ( Gamba and Fachinetti, 2020 28. Gamba, R. ∙ Fachinetti, D. From evolution to function: Two sides of the same CENP-B coin? Exp. Cell Res. 2020; 390 :111959 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Genetic conflict between selfish centromere DNA and centromere-binding proteins potentially explains the complexity of eukaryotic centromeres. Opportunities for selfish genetic elements to exploit the chromosome segregation machinery are not limited to female meiosis, as selfish plasmids (e.g., 2-micron plasmids in budding yeast) benefit by maximizing their transmission to daughter cells in mitosis ( Malik and Henikoff, 2009 59. Malik, H.S. ∙ Henikoff, S. Major evolutionary transitions in centromere complexity Cell. 2009; 138 :1067-1082 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rizvi et al., 2018 82. Rizvi, S.M.A. ∙ Prajapati, H.K. ∙ Ghosh, S.K. The 2 micron plasmid: a selfish genetic element with an optimized survival strategy within Saccharomyces cerevisiae Curr. Genet. 2018; 64 :25-42 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). These opportunities are limited by the strong epigenetic component of most eukaryotic centromeres, which are not defined by specific DNA sequences. Centromeres cannot be completely independent of the underlying DNA sequence, however, because some protein must interact with DNA, so different sequences can have different binding affinities or impact the structure of the centromeric nucleosome complex ( Allu et al., 2019 6. Allu, P.K. ∙ Dawicki-McKenna, J.M. ∙ Van Eeuwen, T. ... Structure of the human core centromeric nucleosome complex Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :2625-2639 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). The presence of multiple pathways to form a kinetochore (e.g., via CENP-ACLN and CENP-TWSX connected by CENP-HIKM, or via CENP-OPQUR) ( Cortes-Silva et al., 2020 15.

Structure of the inner kinetochore CCAN complex assembled onto a centromeric nucleosome Nature. 2019; 574 :278-282 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) allows proteins to adapt by minimizing a pathway that is exploited by a selfish element, while maintaining kinetochore function via other pathways. Consistent with this idea of independent modules for kinetochore formation, CENP-A depletion leads to proportional reduction of centromeric CENP-C, whereas CENP-T and CENP-I persist longer ( Fachinetti et al., 2013 21. Fachinetti, D. ∙ Folco, H.D. ∙ Nechemia-Arbely, Y. ... A two-step mechanism for epigenetic specification of centromere identity and function Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15 :1056-1066 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, recurrent changes in kinetochore modules are observed throughout eukaryotic evolution, such as changes in the number of MELT motifs in KNL1 and replacement of the SKA complex by the DAM complex ( van Hooff et al., 2017 98. van Hooff, J.J.E. ∙ Snel, B. ∙ Kops, G.J.P.L. Unique phylogenetic distributions of the Ska and Dam1 complexes support functional analogy and suggest multiple parallel displacements of Ska by Dam1 Genome Biol. Evol. 2017; 9 :1295-1303 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tromer et al., 2015 95. Tromer, E. ∙ Snel, B. ∙ Kops, G.J.P.L. Widespread recurrent patterns of rapid repeat evolution in the kinetochore scaffold KNL1 Genome Biol. Evol. 2015; 7 :2383-2393 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachment stability may be another way to suppress selfish genetic elements, as MELT motifs recruit BUB1 and SKA and DAM complexes stabilize attachments. Thus, internal conflicts between selfish genetic elements and the chromosome segregation machinery may have shaped complexity in eukaryotic centromeres.
Although we are able to experimentally weaken the kinetochore pathway specifically by rat CENP-C expression, we are unable to reduce heterochromatin without also perturbing the kinetochore pathway. Functional changes in heterochromatin likely require manipulations on longer timescales than the typical microinjection experiment, so testing possible experimental strategies will require transgenic or genome-edited animals. Given this limitation, our results imply that the dominant effect of CENP-B deletion is to weaken the heterochromatin pathway, as explained in the Results . Alternatively, CENP-B may equalize centromeres through an uncharacterized pathway independent of kinetochore assembly and heterochromatin, to explain our finding that CENP-B deletion increases functional asymmetry.

Mouse strains were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (ZALENDE/EiJ, stock #001392 corresponds to CHPO; C57BL/6J, stock# 000664) and from Envigo (NSA, stock# 033 corresponds to CF-1). CHPO males were crossed to CF-1 females to generate hybrids shown in Figure 1 C and Figure S1 B. The CHPO strain contains seven Robertsonian fusions (Rb(1.3), Rb(4.6), Rb(5.15), Rb(11.13), Rb(8.12), Rb(9.14), and Rb(16.17)), each of which pairs with two CF-1 chromosomes in CHPO hybrid meiosis I to form a trivalent ( Chmátal et al., 2014 13. Chmátal, L. ∙ Gabriel, S.I. ∙ Mitsainas, G.P. ... Centromere strength provides the cell biological basis for meiotic drive and karyotype evolution in mice Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :2295-2300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). We included only bivalents (chromosome 2, 7, 10, 18, 19, X) in our analyses to avoid complications of trivalents.
In order to generate CENP-B null mice, 1-cell embryos (from female CF-1 and male DBA/2J x C57BL/6J hybrid) were collected and microinjected with Cas9 mRNA (TriLink, CleanCap Cas9 mRNA, L-7606) and gRNA (GAAGAACAAGCGCGCCA) (Thermo Fisher scientific, GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit, A29377). Embryos were cultured in vitro until blastocyst stage and transferred to pseudopregnant females to produce a founder mouse carrying 37bp deletion (TGAGCACCATCCTGAAGAACAAGCGCGCCATCCTGGC) that produces a premature stop codon at Leu100 in the DNA binding domain. The founder was crossed with C57BL/6J for multiple generations to remove possible off-target mutations. Mice were genotyped by extracting genomic DNA from tail clip (QIAGEN, DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, 69504) and amplifying a Cenpb fragment (Agilent, Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase). To generate Cenpb null mice with larger and smaller centromeres, CHPO females were crossed to C57BL/6J Cenpb null males to generate first generation hybrid females, which were then crossed to C57BL/6J Cenpb null males to generate second-generation hybrid females as shown in Figure 3 B and Figure S3 D. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were consistent with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. The age of the mice used in the study was 8-14 weeks.
Female mice (8-14 weeks of age) were hormonally primed with 5U of Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG, Calbiochem, cat# 367222) or 0.1mL of CARD HyperOva (Cosmo Bio, KYD-010-EX) 44-48 h prior to oocyte collection. Germinal vesicle (GV)-intact oocytes were collected in M2 medium (Sigma, M7167), denuded from cumulus cells, and cultured in Chatot-Ziomek-Bavister (CZB) medium (Thermo Fisher, MR019D) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air at 37.8C ° . During collection, meiotic resumption was inhibited by addition of 2.5 mM milrinone. Milrinone was subsequently washed out to allow meiotic resumption. Oocytes were checked for GVBD (germinal vesicle breakdown), and those that did not enter GVBD stage were removed from the culture.
GV oocytes were microinjected with ∼5 pl of cRNAs in M2 medium (with 2.5 mM milrinone and 3mg/mL BSA) at room temperature (RT) with a micromanipulator TransferMan NK 2 (Eppendorf) and picoinjector (Medical Systems Corp.). After the injection, oocytes were kept in milrinone for 16 h to allow protein expression. cRNAs used for microinjections were dCas9-EGFP (dead Cas9 with EGFP at the N terminus) at 1000ng/μL, dCas9-mCherry (dead Cas9 with mCherry at the N terminus) at 1000ng/μL, gRNA that targets minor satellite repeat (ACACTGAAAAACACATTCGT) at 200ng/μL, H2B-EGFP (human histone H2B with EGFP at the C terminus) at 150ng/μL, H2B-mCherry (human histone H2B with mCherry at the C terminus) at 150ng/μL, EGFP-MmCENP-C (mouse CENP-C with EGFP at the N terminus) at 100ng/μL, EGFP-RnCENP-C (rat CENP-C with EGFP at the N terminus) at 100ng/μL, and EGFP-RpCENP-C ( R. pumilio CENP-C with EGFP at the N terminus) at 100ng/μL. Mouse, rat and R. pumilio CENP-C sequences were cloned from cDNA libraries from liver. Mouse and rat CENP-C sequences were verified by mm10 Mus musculus and rn6 Rattus norvegicus reference genomes. R. pumilio CENP-C sequence was verified by the genome sequence (personal communication with Ricardo Mallarino). cRNAs were synthesized using the T7 mScriptTM Standard mRNA Production System (CELL SCRIPT) or mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher scientific). gRNAs were synthesized using GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher scientific A29377).
For the chromosome position assay, oocytes were collected and microinjected with the constructs indicated in the figure legends. After inducing meiotic resumption by washing out milrinone, oocytes were placed into 2μL drops of CZB media covered with mineral oil in a glass-bottom tissue culture dish (FluoroDish FD35-100) in a heated environmental chamber with a stage top incubator (Incubator BL and Heating Insert P; PeCon GmBH) to maintain 37C ° . Confocal images were collected with a microscope (DMI4000 B; Leica) equipped with a 63x 1.3 NA glycerol-immersion objective lens, an xy piezo Z stage (Applied Scientific Instrumentation), a spinning disk confocal scanner (Yokogawa Corporation of America), and an electron multiplier charge-coupled device camera (ImageEM C9100-13; Hamamatsu Photonics), controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Excitation was with an LMM5 laser merge module with 488- and 593-nm lasers (Spectral Applied Research) or a Vortran Stradus VersaLase 4 laser module with 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 639 nm lasers (Vortran Laser Technology). Confocal images were collected as z stacks at 0.5 μm intervals to visualize the entire meiotic spindle. The position of the spindle near the cortex was confirmed by differential interference contrast images. The spindle equator was determined as a middle of the spindle. The chromosome position of each bivalent was determined as a crossover site and normalized by the distance between spindle equator and spindle poles.
After inducing meiotic resumption by washing out milrinone (4.5 hours for prometaphase staining and 7.5 hours for metaphase staining), MI oocytes were fixed in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, for 20 min at RT, permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at RT, placed in blocking solution (PBS containing 0.3% BSA and 0.01% Tween-20) 15 min RT or overnight at 4C, incubated 1-2 h with primary antibodies in blocking solution, washed 3 times for 15 min each, incubated 1 h with secondary antibodies, washed 3 times for 15 min each, and mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (Vector, H-1200) to visualize chromosomes. Primary antibodies used for this study were rabbit anti-human H3K9me3 (1:500; Abcam, ab8898), mouse anti-mouse SGO2 (1:500, a gift from Yoshinori Watanabe), and rabbit anti-mouse CENP-C (1:2500, a gift from Yoshinori Watanabe). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse, or Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse (1:500, Invitrogen). Confocal images were collected as z stacks at 0.5 μm intervals to visualize the entire meiotic spindle, using the spinning disc confocal microscope described above. To quantify centromere signal ratios, optical slices containing centromeres from the same bivalent were added to produce a sum projection using Fiji/ImageJ. Ellipses were drawn around the centromeres, and signal intensity was integrated over each ellipse after subtracting cytoplasmic background. Ratios were obtained for each bivalent by dividing the intensity of the larger centromere by that of the smaller centromere, as determined by dCas9 signal intensity.
Frozen tissue samples from male individuals were obtained from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, Berkeley, CA (MZV) and the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL (FMNH). Hylomyscus alleni (MVZ Mamm 196246) was captured in Cameroon in 2000, Praomys delectorum (MVZ Mamm 221157) was captured in Malawi in 2007, Mastomys natalensis (MVZ Mamm 221054) was captured in Malawi in 2007, Grammomys dolichurus (MVZ Mamm 221001) was captured in Malawi in 2007, Rhabdomys dilectus (FMNH 192475) was captured in Malawi in 2006, and Rhynchomys soricoides (FMNH 198792) was captured in The Philippines in 2008. All genomes were sequenced in the Center for Applied Genomics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. High molecular weight DNA was extracted following the protocol provided by 10xGenomics (CG000072 Rev B Sample Preparation Demonstrated Protocol, DNA Extraction from Fresh Frozen Tissue). Extracted DNA was quality controlled (CG00019 Rev B Sample Preparation Demonstrated Protocol, High Molecular Weight DNA QC), and all of the samples had a mean length greater than 50kb, and high enough concentration to dilute to 1ng/μL for library preparation. Chromium Genome Reagent Kits v2 from 10xGenomics was used to prepare libraries of 2x150 base reads, with read 1 constituting 10xBarcode (16bp) + nmer (6bp) + genome sequence (128bp) and read 2 constituting genome sequence (150bp). i7 index used 8bp sample index, and i5 index was not used. Sequencing depth was calculated based on putative genome size 3Gb and coverage 56x, following 10xGenomics R&D recommendation, and the libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq. Demultiplexed FASTQ files were analyzed using the LongRanger wgs -basic pipeline. This pipeline gave general QC statistics related to the 10x barcoding and number of read pairs present in the FASTQ files. All sample FASTQs contained more than 688M read pairs and have acceptable barcode diversity/% on whitelist. LongRanger was used to assemble genomes, using the Mus musculus (mm10) as reference. In parallel, Supernova was used to assemble de novo genomes. See Table S1 for assembly statistics. In order to obtain protein coding sequences, mm10 annotation was used to annotate reference-guided assemblies, and translated BLAST (tblastn) was used to pull homologous sequences from de novo assemblies using Mus musculus protein sequences as query sequences.
The species tree shown in Figure 4 B was obtained from maximum likelihood (RAxML) and Bayesian inference (MrBayes). The phylogeny within Mus was previously studied ( Keane et al., 2011 48. Keane, T.M. ∙ Goodstadt, L. ∙ Danecek, P. ... Mouse genomic variation and its effect on phenotypes and gene regulation Nature. 2011; 477 :289-294 Crossref Scopus (958) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thybert et al., 2018 94. Thybert, D. ∙ Roller, M. ∙ Navarro, F.C.P. ... Repeat associated mechanisms of genome evolution and function revealed by the Mus caroli and Mus pahari genomes Genome Res. 2018; 28 :448-459 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to resolve phylogeny in Murinae, the same set of genes that were used to construct a primate phylogenetic tree ( Perelman et al., 2011 76. Perelman, P. ∙ Johnson, W.E. ∙ Roos, C. ... A molecular phylogeny of living primates PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 :e1001342 Crossref Scopus (807) PubMed Google Scholar ) was aligned by MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 45. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (16422) PubMed Google Scholar ; Katoh et al., 2002 46. Katoh, K. ∙ Misawa, K. ∙ Kuma, K. ... MAFFT: a novel method for rapid multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 :3059-3066 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The initial alignment was imported in Geneious Prime, and manually inspected for sequence alignment ambiguity. Ambiguous regions were removed from subsequent analyses. Maximum likelihood tree was constructed with RAxML ( Stamatakis, 2014 89. Stamatakis, A. RAxML version 8: a tool for phylogenetic analysis and post-analysis of large phylogenies Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1312-1313 Crossref Scopus (15517) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Bayesian inference tree was constructed with MrBayes ( Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 37. Huelsenbeck, J.P. ∙ Ronquist, F. MRBAYES: Bayesian inference of phylogenetic trees Bioinformatics. 2001; 17 :754-755 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), with Peromyscus maniculatus as outgroup. Both inferences supported the tree topology shown in Figure 4 B.
In order to create a histogram in Figure 4 C, alignments of mouse-rat orthologs were filtered for dS below 0.5, as higher dS values indicate misalignment. A list of genes for each subcellular compartment was obtained from Human Protein Atlas. Mouse-human orthologs were used to calculate average dN/dS for each subcellular compartment in Figure 4 D. The analysis to identify signatures of positive selection (PAML) is highly sensitive to alignment errors, so automated genome-wide analysis is prone to false positives ( van der Lee et al., 2017 97. van der Lee, R. ∙ Wiel, L. ∙ van Dam, T.J.P. ... Genome-scale detection of positive selection in nine primates predicts human-virus evolutionary conflicts Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :10634-10648 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). To prevent these errors, alignments for selected genes were manually inspected. Coding sequences for each gene were aligned by Geneious Alignment (translation align) implemented in Geneious Prime, and manually inspected for sequence alignment ambiguity. Insertions or deletions as well as their flanking codons were removed from analyses. To test signatures of positive selection, we compared the likelihood of models of neutral codon evolution to models of codon evolution allowing positive selection, implemented in PAML version 4 ( Yang, 2007 104. Yang, Z. PAML 4: phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24 :1586-1591 Crossref Scopus (7094) PubMed Google Scholar ). The neutral model M1 (fixed dN/dS values between 0 to 1) and M2 (M1 parameters plus dN/dS > 1) were compared in the first test, and the neutral model M7 (dN/dS values fit a beta distribution from 0 to 1) and M8 (M7 parameters plus dN/dS > 1) were compared in the second test, assuming the F3x4 model of codon frequencies. Degree of freedom for each test was 2, and the log likelihood test was significant above 5.99 (p < 0.05). We first used the species tree, and signatures of positive selection were confirmed using a gene tree for each gene, created by RAxML.
Data points are pooled from at least two independent experiments. The following statistical methods were used: unpaired t test in Figures 2 B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2G, 2I, 3 A, 3C, 3D, S1 D, S1G, S1H, S3 E, and S3F; Mann-Whitney U test in Figure 4 D; ordinary one-way ANOVA in Figure S1 D; chi square test for goodness of fit for deviations from 1 in Figure 1 D and for statistical models (likelihood-ratio test) in Figure 4 E and Table S2 ; Naive Emprical Bayes (NEB) analysis and Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis in Figures 4 B and 4E; F test to compare variance in Figure S5 C. The exact value of n, what n represents, and definition of center can be found in the figure legends for each experiment. Unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, ordinary one-way ANOVA, and F test were performed using GraphPad Prism; chi square tests were performed using Excel; NEB and BEB analyses were performed using PAML model 2 and 8. P value of less than 0.05 was judged as statistically significant.
