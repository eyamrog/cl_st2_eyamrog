Title: Liver Immune Profiling Reveals Pathogenesis and Therapeutics for Biliary Atresia


Abstract: Summary

Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe cholangiopathy that leads to liver failure in infants, but its pathogenesis remains to be fully characterized. By single-cell RNA profiling, we observed macrophage hypo-inflammation, Kupffer cell scavenger function defects, cytotoxic T cell expansion, and deficiency of CX3CR1 + effector T and natural killer (NK) cells in infants with BA. More importantly, we discovered that hepatic B cell lymphopoiesis did not cease after birth and that tolerance defects contributed to immunoglobulin G (IgG)-autoantibody accumulation in BA. In a rhesus-rotavirus induced BA model, depleting B cells or blocking antigen presentation ameliorated liver damage. In a pilot clinical study, we demonstrated that rituximab was effective in depleting hepatic B cells and restoring the functions of macrophages, Kupffer cells, and T cells to levels comparable to those of control subjects. In summary, our comprehensive immune profiling in infants with BA had educed that B-cell-modifying therapies may alleviate liver pathology.

Section: Introduction

Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe cholangiopathy mediated by extrahepatic bile duct obstruction, causing pathological jaundice and liver failure in early infancy ( Asai et al., 2015 2. Asai, A. ∙ Miethke, A. ∙ Bezerra, J.A. Pathogenesis of biliary atresia: defining biology to understand clinical phenotypes Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2015; 12 :342-352 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). The incidence of BA varies geographically, ranging from 1 in every 5,000–18,000 live births ( Hartley et al., 2009 26. Hartley, J.L. ∙ Davenport, M. ∙ Kelly, D.A. Biliary atresia Lancet. 2009; 374 :1704-1713 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (754) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multifactorial etiological factors, from both developmental and environmental origins, contribute to disease development ( Lakshminarayanan and Davenport, 2016 41. Lakshminarayanan, B. ∙ Davenport, M. Biliary atresia: A comprehensive review J. Autoimmun. 2016; 73 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai’s operation) is required to remove the duct remnants after diagnosis ( Hopkins et al., 2017 31. Hopkins, P.C. ∙ Yazigi, N. ∙ Nylund, C.M. Incidence of Biliary Atresia and Timing of Hepatoportoenterostomy in the United States J. Pediatr. 2017; 187 :253-257 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). If untreated, BA progression to end-stage liver cirrhosis is rapid, usually within 1 year. After Kasai’s operation, approximately 50% of the BA patients will require liver transplantation within the first 2 years of life due to liver cirrhosis, and most of the remainder children relying on their native livers will suffer long-term complications, including repeated cholangitis, portal hypertension, esophageal variceal bleeding, and hepatic osteodystrophy ( Sundaram et al., 2017 80. Sundaram, S.S. ∙ Mack, C.L. ∙ Feldman, A.G. ... Biliary atresia: Indications and timing of liver transplantation and optimization of pretransplant care Liver Transpl. 2017; 23 :96-109 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Virus-associated autoimmune destruction of the bile duct has been considered an important contributor of BA pathogenesis ( Asai et al., 2015 2. Asai, A. ∙ Miethke, A. ∙ Bezerra, J.A. Pathogenesis of biliary atresia: defining biology to understand clinical phenotypes Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2015; 12 :342-352 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bessho and Bezerra, 2011 6. Bessho, K. ∙ Bezerra, J.A. Biliary atresia: will blocking inflammation tame the disease? Annu. Rev. Med. 2011; 62 :171-185 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD68 + macrophages and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-secreting CD4 + and CD8 + T cells accumulated around the portal tracts ( Mack et al., 2004 55. Mack, C.L. ∙ Tucker, R.M. ∙ Sokol, R.J. ... Biliary atresia is associated with CD4+ Th1 cell-mediated portal tract inflammation Pediatr. Res. 2004; 56 :79-87 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ) and biliary ductal epithelium ( Ohya et al., 1995 66. Ohya, T. ∙ Fujimoto, T. ∙ Shimomura, H. ... Degeneration of intrahepatic bile duct with lymphocyte infiltration into biliary epithelial cells in biliary atresia J. Pediatr. Surg. 1995; 30 :515-518 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) in infants with BA. In a rhesus rotavirus (RRV)-induced BA mouse model, blocking IFN-γ production prevented the inflammatory and fibrosing obstruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts ( Shivakumar et al., 2004 76. Shivakumar, P. ∙ Campbell, K.M. ∙ Sabla, G.E. ... Obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts by lymphocytes is regulated by IFN-gamma in experimental biliary atresia J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114 :322-329 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) β-chain variable regions had uncovered oligoclonal expansion of infiltrating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in infants with BA ( Tucker et al., 2007 86. Tucker, R.M. ∙ Hendrickson, R.J. ∙ Mukaida, N. ... Progressive biliary destruction is independent of a functional tumor necrosis factor-alpha pathway in a rhesus rotavirus-induced murine model of biliary atresia Viral Immunol. 2007; 20 :34-43 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire in the biliary remnants of BA patients was also oligoclonal ( Taylor et al., 2019 82. Taylor, S.A. ∙ Malladi, P. ∙ Pan, X. ... Oligoclonal immunoglobulin repertoire in biliary remnants of biliary atresia Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :4508 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). IgM and IgG autoantibodies deposited along the basement of the bile duct epithelia ( Hadchouel et al., 1981 22. Hadchouel, M. ∙ Hugon, R.N. ∙ Odievre, M. Immunoglobulin deposits in the biliary remnants of extrahepatic biliary atresia: a study by immunoperoxidase staining in 128 infants Histopathology. 1981; 5 :217-221 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) and autoantibodies that target epithelial α-enolase had been shown to cross-react with viral antigens in infants with BA ( Lu et al., 2010 52. Lu, B.R. ∙ Brindley, S.M. ∙ Tucker, R.M. ... α-enolase autoantibodies cross-reactive to viral proteins in a mouse model of biliary atresia Gastroenterology. 2010; 139 :1753-1761 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autoantibodies were also highly elevated in the circulation in infants with BA ( Pang et al., 2018 67. Pang, S.Y. ∙ Dai, Y.M. ∙ Zhang, R.Z. ... Autoimmune liver disease-related autoantibodies in patients with biliary atresia World J. Gastroenterol. 2018; 24 :387-396 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notwithstanding the above information, a comprehensive description of immune dysfunction that leads to rapid liver failure in infants with BA has yet to be established.
In this study, we profiled mononuclear immune cells (granulocyte depleted) from liver biopsies and blood of infants with BA, and compared the profiles with those of control subjects at single-cell resolution. We identified 42 cell subsets encompassing tissue-resident and circulating conventional (CD4 + and CD8 + T) and unconventional (natural killer T [NKT], mucosal-associated invariant T [MAIT], gamma-delta T [γδT]) T cells, B cells, innate lymphoid cells (natural killer [NK], type 1 innate lymphoid cells [ILC1s]), monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and Kupffer cells. Importantly, we showed that B cell lymphopoiesis in the liver was extended beyond birth, persisting through at least the first few months of life. These B cells formed a functional hub, and their dysregulation contributed to autoantibody accumulation and liver failure in infants with BA. We provided pre-clinical and clinical evidence showing that B-cell-modifying therapies may be used to restore liver immune function for infants with BA.

Section: Results

We studied two cohorts of children: one with BA and the other with choledochal cysts (CC). Both required surgical operations for bile drainage but had contrasting clinical prognoses. BA was diagnosed when the intrahepatic biliary tree and/or the extrahepatic bile duct cannot be observed during intraoperative cholangiography. CC was diagnosed according to cystic dilation of the common bile duct due to malformations at the intersection of the bile and the pancreatic ducts. On retrospective examination of the electronic medical records of BA (n = 927), CC (n = 248), physiologic jaundice (n = 9,297), and healthy subjects (n = 2,471), we found that infants with BA had persistently elevated concentrations of r-glutamyl transferase (r-GT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bile acid (TBA), and direct bilirubin (DBIL) ( Figures 1 A and 1B), consistent with advanced liver pathology. In contrast, laboratory indices and long-term prognosis of patients with CC were comparable to those of the healthy control subjects. To deduce immune pathogenesis of infants with BA, we chose CC as well as non-cholestatic subjects with normal liver function as control subjects ( Figure 1 C).
Notably, indirect bilirubin (IBIL) concentrations in infants with BA were significantly lower than those in infants with physiological jaundice ( Figure S1 A). Thus, the combined values of decreased IBIL with increased r-GT, ALT, AST, TBA, and DBIL could potentially offer an additional biomarker for the detection of patients with BA to distinguish them from those with physiological jaundice or CC ( Figure S1 B). Critically, nearly 50% of patients will require liver transplantation within one year after Kasai's operation ( Figure S1 C). Therefore, there is a serious need for more effective treatments.
To identify immune changes associated with BA, we generated 159,622 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes for immune cells (CD45 + cells excluding granulocytes) from 6 BA, 6 CC (control-CC), and 4 non-cholestatic (control-other) control subjects ( Figure 1 D). Single-cell V(D)J profiling of T and B cells was also performed for each of the 16 subjects. After data pre-processing and quality control, immune cells were partitioned into 11 major clusters ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Cell clustering was based on shared expression features of known marker genes. All cellular subsets had representative cells from each individual sample. Batch effects were negligible ( Figure S1 D). Sub-clustering analysis revealed 42 subsets ( Figure S1 E). Transcriptional features and candidate ligand-receptor pairs for all subsets were provided ( Tables S1 , S2 , and S3 ).
We identified 17 subsets of conventional (CD4 + and CD8 + ) and unconventional T cells (γδT and MAIT cells) from blood and liver biopsies ( Figures 2 A–2C). Among the 5 CD4 T cell subsets, cytotoxic T helper 1 (cTh1) cells were defined according to the expression of both Th1 ( CXCR3 + IFNG + ) and cytotoxic T cell programs ( GZMA + GZMK + ) ( Takeuchi and Saito, 2017 81. Takeuchi, A. ∙ Saito, T. CD4 CTL, a Cytotoxic Subset of CD4 + T Cells, Their Differentiation and Function Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :194 Crossref Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ); ex-cTh17 cells were defined according to the expression of cytotoxic, Th17 ( CCR6 + RORA + RORC + IL23R + ) and Th1 ( STAT4 + IFNG + ) programs ( Harbour et al., 2015 25. Harbour, S.N. ∙ Maynard, C.L. ∙ Zindl, C.L. ... Th17 cells give rise to Th1 cells that are required for the pathogenesis of colitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :7061-7066 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hirota et al., 2011 29. Hirota, K. ∙ Duarte, J.H. ∙ Veldhoen, M. ... Fate mapping of IL-17-producing T cells in inflammatory responses Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :255-263 Crossref Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both cTh1 and ex-cTh17 cells were significantly increased in the liver biopsies of infants with BA ( Figure S2 A). Analysis of shared TCR clonotypes revealed an increased trend of cell fate transition between ex-cTh17 and cTh1 cells in BA compared with that of control subjects ( Figure S2 B). Transcriptional ( Figure S2 C) and functional analysis confirmed these findings and showed that the proportions of ROR-γt + IFN-γ + ex-cTh17 cells were significantly increased in liver biopsies of infants with BA compared with those of control subjects ( Figure S2 D).
The comparison of gene expression revealed shared transcriptional programs of ex-cTh17 and cTh1 cells, including genes regulating Th17 ( IKZF3 and DUSP2 ) ( Lu et al., 2015 53. Lu, D. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Ji, X. ... The phosphatase DUSP2 controls the activity of the transcription activator STAT3 and regulates TH17 differentiation Nat.

Immunol. 2010; 185 :5247-5258 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ) differentiation, cytotoxicity ( GZMK , CTSC , and CST7 ) ( Perišić Nanut et al., 2017 69.

Interleukin-32: a new proinflammatory cytokine involved in hepatitis C virus-related liver inflammation and fibrosis Hepatology. 2011; 53 :1819-1829 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), chemotaxis ( CCL5 and CCL4 ), immunoproteasome, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation ( PSMB9 , RARRES3 , and HLA-DR , HLD-DP ) ( Figures S2 E and S2F). Apart from CD4 T cells, IL-17 + γδT (ex-γδT17) and IL-17 + MAIT (ex-MAIT17) also exhibited TBX21 + STAT4 + EOMES + phenotypes and highly expressed IFN-γ, which suggested that the altered liver inflammatory microenvironment would have promoted Th17 to Th1 trans -differentiation in the livers of infants with BA ( Figure S2 G).
For the CD8 T cell compartment, biopsies from infants with BA contained significantly increased proportions of CD69 + tissue-resident memory T (CD8Trm) cells, but the proportions of CX3CR1 + CD8 effector T (CX3CR1 + CD8Teff) cells ( Böttcher et al., 2015 7.

TCR profiling revealed that CD8Trm cells displayed substantially increased clonal expansion in infants with BA compared with that of control subjects ( Figure 2 D). Analysis of shared TCR clonotypes revealed that TCF7 + LEF1 + CXCR3 + XCL1 + stem-cell-like memory CD8 T cells (CD8Tscm) ( Gattinoni et al., 2017 18.

By examining the phenotypes of proliferating CD8 T cells in the liver, we confirmed that the proportions of CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells were significantly decreased in infants with BA compared with those of control subjects ( Figure 2 G).
Hepatic stellate cells secrete CX3CL1 ( Bourd-Boittin et al., 2009 8. Bourd-Boittin, K. ∙ Basset, L. ∙ Bonnier, D. ... CX3CL1/fractalkine shedding by human hepatic stellate cells: contribution to chronic inflammation in the liver J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2009; 13 :1526-1535 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ), which mediates recruitment and adhesion of CX3CR1-expressing lymphocytes ( Bazan et al., 1997 4.

Identification and molecular characterization of fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, which mediates both leukocyte migration and adhesion Cell. 1997; 91 :521-530 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1235) PubMed Google Scholar ), Kupffer cells ( Karlmark et al., 2010 34. Karlmark, K.R. ∙ Zimmermann, H.W. ∙ Roderburg, C. ... The fractalkine receptor CX 3 CR1 protects against liver fibrosis by controlling differentiation and survival of infiltrating hepatic monocytes Hepatology. 2010; 52 :1769-1782 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ), and monocyte-derived macrophages ( Karlmark et al., 2010 34. Karlmark, K.R. ∙ Zimmermann, H.W. ∙ Roderburg, C. ... The fractalkine receptor CX 3 CR1 protects against liver fibrosis by controlling differentiation and survival of infiltrating hepatic monocytes Hepatology. 2010; 52 :1769-1782 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice deficient in Cx3cr1 are prone to secrete tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which activate hepatic stellate cells and promote fibrosis. To uncover a potential role for CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells in control of fibrosis, we first compared differentially expressed genes ( Figure S3 C) and transcription factors (TFs) ( Figure S3 D) with those of CD8Trm cells. By Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells were enriched with genes that promote migration ( Figure S3 E). Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of purified CX3CR1 + CD8Teff and CD8Trm cells confirmed these findings ( Figure S3 F). Analysis of TFs and their target genes suggested that ASCL2 , BATF , KLF2 , and PRDM1 were active and may regulate the migration and function of the CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells ( Figure S3 G). Subsequently, we found that the expression levels of ASCL2 , KLF2 , CX3CR1 , and S1PR1 were significantly decreased in CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells in infants with BA compared with those from control subjects ( Figure 2 H). We validated the effects of CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells and confirmed that they suppressed the expression of fibrogenic genes ( COL1A1 and COL1A2 ) when co-cultured with a hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2 cells) ( Figure 2 I).
We identified 5 populations of innate lymphocytes (ILCs), comprising KLRD1 + NCAM1 dim CX3CR1 + circulating NK cells (cir-NK), KLRD1 + NCAM1 + CX3CR1 − CD69 + liver-resident NK cells (lr-NK), IFNG -expressing lrNK (lr-NK-IFNG hi ), IL7R + TCF7 + SELL + KLRD1 + NCAM1 + ILC1-like cells, and IL7R + TCF7 + SELL + KLRD1 lo KIT + AHR + LTB + lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Two subsets of unconventional T cells, namely the KLRD1 + CX3CR1 + CD3D + circulating NKT (cir-NKT) cells and the KLRD1 + CX3CR1 - CD3D + CD69 + liver-resident NKT (lr-NKT) cells, clustered closely with the ILCs and were analyzed in parallel ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Figure S4 A).
The proportions of CX3CR1 -expressing cir-NK and cir-NKT cells were also significantly decreased in liver biopsies of infants with BA ( Figures S4 B and S4C). Similar to the CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells, cir-NK cells were also enriched with genes that promote migration and interaction with non-lymphoid cells in comparison to lr-NK cells ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Interestingly, ASCL2 and KLF2 were also active in cir-NK cells ( Figure 3 C; Figure S4 F). In fact, a comparison of the CX3CR1 -expressing cir-NK with CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells revealed a common program affected by ASCL2 and KLF2, including high expression of genes associated with migration ( CX3CR1 and S1PR5 ) ( Drouillard et al., 2018 15. Drouillard, A. ∙ Mathieu, A.L. ∙ Marcais, A. ... S1PR5 is essential for human natural killer cell migration toward sphingosine-1 phosphate J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2018; 141 :2265-2268.e2261 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) and collagen binding ( ADGRG1 , LAIR1 , and LAIR2 ) ( Franzke et al., 2002 17.

USA. 2011; 108 :12925-12930 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 D and 3E). By chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis of cir-NK cells, we confirmed that ASCL2 was bound to the promoter of KLF2. In addition, KLF2 was bound to the promoter of CX3CR1 in HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged KLF2 ( Figure 3 F).
We observed that the expressions of TFs and receptors that promote cir-NK cell migration were not significantly different in infants with BA compared with those in control subjects ( Figure 3 G), which indicated that additional mechanisms (e.g., ligand concentration or bile flow obstruction) may attribute to recruitment defects of the cir-NK cells in infants with BA. We examined the concentrations of CX3CL1 and found that they were significantly decreased in liver biopsies of infants with BA compared with control subjects ( Figure 3 H). To establish a potential contribution of bile duct obstruction, we analyzed hepatic NK cells using an RRV-induced BA model, in which jaundice normally occurs at day 7 following RRV infection. At day 12, we found that both the production of Cx3cl1 and the proportions of cir-NK cells were significantly decreased in the livers of the RRV-infected mice compared with those in the control littermates ( Figures S4 G and S4H).
Cytotoxic lymphocytes, including T and NK cells, are capable of triggering granzyme-mediated death of target cells ( Zhang et al., 2020 95. Zhang, Z. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Xia, S. ... Gasdermin E suppresses tumour growth by activating anti-tumour immunity Nature. 2020; 579 :415-420 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2020 97. Zhou, Z. ∙ He, H. ∙ Wang, K. ... Granzyme A from cytotoxic lymphocytes cleaves GSDMB to trigger pyroptosis in target cells Science. 2020; 368 :eaaz7548 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed co-staining of granzyme B (encoded by GZMB ) in hepatic fibroblast (α-SMA + ) cells and showed that their co-localization was significantly decreased in infants with BA ( Figure 3 I). Collectively, these data highlight that reduced CX3CR1-CX3CL1-mediated killing of fibroblasts may contribute to liver fibrosis in infants with BA.
We identified 9 subsets of myeloid cells, including 3 monocyte subsets ( CD14 + , CD16 + , and CD14 + CD16 + monocytes), 3 DC subsets ( CLEC9A + CD141 + XCR1 + cDC1, CD1C + cDC2, and pDC), Kupffer cells ( CD5L + C1QA + C1QB + MARCO + VSIG4 + ), and mitotic myeloid cells ( MKI67 + PCNA + ) ( Figures 4 A and 4B). cDC1 and Kupffer cells were mainly detected in the liver ( Figure 4 C). When comparing BA with control subjects, we found that inflammation and chemotaxis were markedly suppressed in myeloid cells of infants with BA ( Figure 4 D). In addition, Kupffer cells from infants with BA exhibited decreased expression of scavenger genes ( MARCO and CD5L ) ( Figure 4 D). This was also validated in vitro , in which Kupffer cells from infants with BA were markedly impaired in their ability to engulf fluorescent-labeled Escherichia coli ( Figure 4 E).
To confirm macrophage hypo-inflammation, we measured concentrations of cytokines in liver biopsy homogenates. The majority of the inflammatory cytokines, except for IL-32, TNFSF8 (CD30L), Chitinase-3-like 1 (CHI3L1), TNFSF13B (B-cell activation factor [BAFF]), IL-8, and MMP-2, were significantly decreased in liver biopsies of infants with BA compared with those of control subjects ( Figure 4 F). CHI3L1 forms a complex with IL-13, which engages IL13RA2 on macrophages and suppresses IL-1β and TNF production ( He et al., 2013 28. He, C.H. ∙ Lee, C.G. ∙ Dela Cruz, C.S. ...

Immun. 2016; 84 :2094-2104 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). The increased concentrations of the soluble receptors (sTNF-R1 and -R2) were also concordant with the decreased TNF concentrations in the liver of infants with BA.
To identify mechanisms underlying myeloid dysfunction, we considered contributions of bile acids, which are cholesterol-derived signaling compounds produced in the liver. Published studies suggest that bile acids suppress inflammation, chemotaxis, and phagocytic function of macrophages by the cell surface receptor TGR5 (encoded by GPBAR1 ) in a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent fashion ( Guo et al., 2016 21.

GPBAR1 was highly expressed by circulating and hepatic myeloid cells ( Figure 4 G). By expression correlation analysis, we confirmed that GPBAR1 expression was positively associated with activation of cAMP signaling, which would have resulted in suppression of inflammatory genes ( Figures 4 H and 4I). Thus, bile acid accumulation might have contributed to hypo-inflammation of the hepatic myeloid cells in infants with BA.
Hematopoiesis in the liver occurs in the human fetus but ceases soon after birth ( Holt and Jones, 2000 30. Holt, P.G. ∙ Jones, C.A. The development of the immune system during pregnancy and early life Allergy. 2000; 55 :688-697 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unexpectedly, we found that hepatic B cell lymphopoiesis remained intact after birth; developmentally related CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ( CD34 + SPINK2 + SOX4 + IL1B + ), pre-pro-B ( CD19 − CD34 + CD10 + RAG1/2 + ), progenitor (pro-B) ( CD19 + CD34 lo CD10 + RAG1/2 + ), precursor (pre-B) ( CD19 + CD10 + CD34 − RAG1 + RAG2 + ), immature ( CD19 + CD10 lo RAG1/2 lo/− ), transitional ( CD19 + CD24 int CD38 i nt ), naive ( CD19 + CD27 − IGHD + ), CD27 + classic memory (CD27 + memory), CD27 − non-classic memory (CD27 − memory), plasmablast (PB) ( CD27 + CD38 + MKI67 + ), and plasma cells (PCs) ( CD27 + CD38 + TNFRSF17 + ) were identified in liver biopsies from control subjects and infants with BA ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Figure S5 A). Specific TFs required for B cell fate maintenance ( PAX5 and SPI1 ) and antibody secretion ( BLIMP1 and XBP1 ) were also detected in the hepatic B cell subsets ( Nutt et al., 2015 63. Nutt, S.L. ∙ Hodgkin, P.D. ∙ Tarlinton, D.M. ... The generation of antibody-secreting plasma cells Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :160-171 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ; Willis and Nutt, 2019 94. Willis, S.N. ∙ Nutt, S.L. New players in the gene regulatory network controlling late B cell differentiation Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2019; 58 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To validate hepatic B cell lymphopoiesis, we performed bulk RNA-seq of HSCs, and the developing B cells sorted respectively from liver biopsies, bone marrows, and PBMCs ( Figure 5 C). In the liver and bone marrow, transcriptional profiles of the counterpart B cells were nearly identical at their respective developmental stages ( Figures S5 C and S5D). To further confirm the above findings in situ , we performed immunofluorescent staining and showed that RAG1 and RAG2 were expressed in the pro-, pre-, and immature B cells (shown as CD10 + B cells) in liver biopsies of both BA and control subjects ( Figure 5 D). Furthermore, we showed that although the proportions of developing CD10 + B cells declined with age, B cell lymphopoiesis nevertheless continued at least through the first 4 months after birth ( Figure 5 E).
Studies of human bone marrow B cells have suggested that the majority of the pre-B and immature B cells possess self-reactive B cell receptors (BCRs). Exit of these B cells from the bone marrow to the periphery requires depletion of the high-affinity BCRs in a process known as central tolerance ( Nemazee, 2017 62. Nemazee, D. Mechanisms of central tolerance for B cells Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :281-294 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that an infectious insult could activate the autoreactive pre-B and immature B cells and predispose infants to autoimmune liver damage. Autoreactive BCRs have been reported to have increased lengths and positively charged amino acids of the heavy chain CDR3 regions ( Wardemann et al., 2003 92. Wardemann, H. ∙ Yurasov, S. ∙ Schaefer, A. ... Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors Science. 2003; 301 :1374-1377 Crossref Scopus (1642) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not observe substantially altered CDR3 lengths or impaired V(D)J recombination in BA compared with control subjects ( Figures S5 E and S5F). However, somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the variable regions ( Figure 5 F) and class switch recombination (CSR) ( Figure 5 G) were visibly decreased in the memory B, PB, and PC populations in infants with BA compared with control subjects. The decreased CSR might be related to elevated expression of TNFSF8 (CD30L) by T and NK cells in infants with BA ( Figure 5 H). CD30 engagement in a hypo-inflammatory environment has been shown to suppress CD40-mediated CSR of human naive B cells ( Cerutti et al., 1998 11. Cerutti, A. ∙ Schaffer, A. ∙ Shah, S. ... CD30 is a CD40-inducible molecule that negatively regulates CD40-mediated immunoglobulin class switching in non-antigen-selected human B cells Immunity. 1998; 9 :247-256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further confirm that B cell lymphopoiesis and tolerance defects contributed to BA pathogenesis, we first measured the serum concentrations of the immunoglobulin isotypes. We found that an increased IgM: IgG4 ratio was associated with significantly prolonged jaundice-free survival after Kasai’s operation in infants with BA ( Figure 6 A). In subsequent analysis of autoantibody involvement, we found that subjects with BA had significantly decreased IgM- but increased IgG-specific autoantibodies to multiple cytosolic and nuclear self-antigens ( Figure 6 B). Self-reactive natural IgM autoantibodies have been shown to protect against microbial invasion, facilitate removal of apoptotic cells, and prevent autoimmune destruction of host cells ( Lobo, 2016 50. Lobo, P.I. Role of Natural Autoantibodies and Natural IgM Anti-Leucocyte Autoantibodies in Health and Disease Front. Immunol. 2016; 7 :198 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). IgG autoantibodies with high affinity to self-antigens, in contrast, can cause tissue damage and autoimmune disease development ( Siloşi et al., 2016 78. Siloşi, I. ∙ Siloşi, C.A. ∙ Boldeanu, M.V. ... The role of autoantibodies in health and disease Rom. J. Morphol. Embryol. 2016; 57 :633-638 PubMed Google Scholar ). Of the B-cell-modifying cytokines that were elevated in liver biopsies of infants with BA ( Figure 6 C), BAFF (encoded by TNFSF13B ) concentrations were positively correlated with Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A (Ro/SSA)-specific IgG concentrations in the liver ( Figure 6 D). This finding is consistent with published studies showing that BAFF promoted the survival of IgG + autoreactive B cells ( Lesley et al., 2004 46. Lesley, R. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Kalled, S.L. ... Reduced competitiveness of autoantigen-engaged B cells due to increased dependence on BAFF Immunity. 2004; 20 :441-453 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ) and accumulation of Ro/SSA-specific IgGs in patients with autoimmune diseases ( Mariette et al., 2003 57. Mariette, X. ∙ Roux, S. ∙ Zhang, J. ... The level of BLyS (BAFF) correlates with the titre of autoantibodies in human Sjögren’s syndrome Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2003; 62 :168-171 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ). The above findings were additionally supported by the expression of autoreactive Ro/SSA-specific BCRs in hepatic B cells ( Figure 6 E).
Apart from producing autoantibodies, B cells may also modify the functions of T, NK, and myeloid cells through MHC-mediated antigen presentation or soluble mediators ( Figure 6 F). We wanted to test whether B-cell-modifying therapies could potentially ameliorate liver damage in an RRV-induced BA mouse model in neonatal BALB/c mice. First, we showed that hepatic B cell lymphopoiesis was present in 11-day-old BALB/c mice ( Figure S6 A). Next, we found that depletion of B cells by an anti-CD20 antibody, or more strikingly blocking MHC-class-II- or MHC-class-I-mediated antigen presentation, significantly improved weight gain and decreased jaundice occurrence compared with untreated RRV mice ( Figures 6 G and 6H). The improved treatment efficacy of anti-MHC-class-I/-II therapy suggested additional contributions of antigen-presenting cells to BA pathogenesis.
Despite the improved outcomes above, 60.6% (20/33) of anti-CD20-treated RRV mice still developed jaundice. These jaundiced mice had increased B1-a, pre-pro-B cells ( Figure S6 B) and IFN-γ + CD4 and CD8 T cells ( Figure 6 I) in the liver compared with the jaundice-free RRV-mice. Thus, depletion efficacy of B cells and abundance of pre-B cells may account for the heterogeneity in response outcomes. Of note, anti-CD20 or anti-MHC-mediated therapies did not impair RRV clearance of the infected mice ( Figure S6 C).
We also found that the concentrations of hepatic Cx3cl1 and C1q (which suppresses autoreactive CD8 + T cells activation) ( Ling et al., 2018 49. Ling, G.S. ∙ Crawford, G. ∙ Buang, N. ... C1q restrains autoimmunity and viral infection by regulating CD8 + T cell metabolism Science. 2018; 360 :558-563 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ) were significantly increased in anti-CD20- or anti-MHC-treated jaundice-free RRV mice ( Figure S6 D). Kupffer cell numbers and scavenger function were also enhanced after treatment ( Figure S6 E). Histologically, lymphocytic infiltration around the liver portal area was decreased and the lobular structures were more intact in the treated RRV mice ( Figure S6 F). At the same time, liver fibrosis, as shown by Masson’s trichrome staining, was reduced in treated compared with untreated RRV mice ( Figure S6 G).
With the efficacy shown in the BA mouse model above, we foreshadowed that anti-CD20 treatment might be useful in infants with BA. Transient B cell depletion with rituximab (RTX) has been used to prevent allograft rejection after liver transplantation in infants with BA ( Egawa et al., 2007 16. Egawa, H. ∙ Ohmori, K. ∙ Haga, H. ... B-cell surface marker analysis for improvement of rituximab prophylaxis in ABO-incompatible adult living donor liver transplantation Liver Transpl. 2007; 13 :579-588 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ; Usuda et al., 2005 87. Usuda, M. ∙ Fujimori, K. ∙ Koyamada, N. ... Successful use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) for ABO-incompatible living-related liver transplantation Transplantation. 2005; 79 :12-16 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the safety and efficacy of RTX, we conducted an open-label pilot clinical study. Four infants with BA were recruited for treatment. We found that a single dose of RTX (187.5 mg/m 2 ) was safe and was not associated with severe adverse events after drug administration. On average, the peripheral and liver-derived B cells were effectively depleted 1 day after RTX administration, and B cell recovery occurred 2–3 months following RTX administration ( Figure 7 A; Figures S7 A–S7C). RTX treatment halted rising of Ro/SSA-IgG concentrations in the 4 trial subjects compared to the 14 BA subjects without RTX treatment ( Figure 7 B).
To uncover immune changes following RTX treatment, we obtained scRNA-seq data from 3 RTX-treated trial subjects. Transcriptomic, TCR, and BCR data of 42,254 single cells were obtained, and 42 clusters were annotated as described above. BCR analysis showed that B cells with CD20 expression were effectively depleted in all patients treated with RTX, whereas the RAG1/2 + B cells and PCs were not significantly affected ( Figure 7 C). Furthermore, RTX treatment significantly decreased the frequency and clonal expansion of CD8Trm cells ( Figure 7 D). Clonal transition between the CX3CR1 + CD8Teff and CD8Trm cells was also significantly decreased ( Figure 7 D).
Transcriptome wide, RTX treatment increased CX3CR1 and cytotoxic gene ( GZMA GZMB ) expression in CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells but decreased IFNG expression in CD8Trm cells. Monocytes from the RTX-treated patients displayed increased expression of inflammasome components ( PYCARD and IL1B ), whereas Kupffer cells showed increased scavenger ( MARCO and CD5L ) and liver regenerative ( CXCL12 ) ( Liepelt and Tacke, 2016 48. Liepelt, A. ∙ Tacke, F. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) as a target in liver diseases Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2016; 311 :G203-G209 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) function ( Figure 7 E). Additionally, expressions of Th17 signature genes ( KLRB1 , RORC , and CCR6 ) were increased in ex-cTh17 cells ( Figure S7 E). It should be mentioned that RTX treatment also decreased the expression of genes associated with T cell co-inhibition ( PDCD1 , LAG3 , and CTLA4 ) in cTh1 and ex-cTh17 cells ( Figure S7 E). The significance of these changes after RTX treatment is currently unknown. Overall, however, transient B cell depletion might serve as a pre- or post-operational strategy to restore liver immune cell function in infants with BA ( Figure 7 F).

Section: Discussion

We showed that patients with BA had persistently elevated DBIL, TBAs, liver enzymes (r-GT, ALT, and AST) and IgG4: IgM ratio. Liver damage was correlated with both immune-mediated destruction and reduced immune restoration. For the former, infants with BA had increased cytotoxic-type immunity (CD8Trm and Th1) but decreased Th17-type immunity (cTh17, MAIT17, and γδT17). ex-Th17 cells had previously been shown to play pathogenetic roles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( Basdeo et al., 2015 3.

Preferential recruitment of interferon-gamma-expressing TH17 cells in multiple sclerosis Ann. Neurol. 2009; 66 :390-402 Crossref Scopus (449) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the latter, infants with BA had fewer CX3CR1 + CD8Teff and cir-NK cells, resulting in deficiency of granzyme-mediated killing of fibroblasts. Moreover, Kupffer cells were defective in the scavenger function. Bile acids, which suppress inflammation and phagocytosis of myeloid cells ( Guo et al., 2016 21. Guo, C. ∙ Xie, S. ∙ Chi, Z. ...

Hang, S. ∙ Paik, D. ∙ Yao, L. ... Bile acid metabolites control T H 17 and T reg cell differentiation Nature. 2019; 576 :143-148 Crossref Scopus (716) PubMed Google Scholar ), might have contributed to many of the aforementioned T cell and myeloid cell dysfunctions in infants with BA.
An unexpected finding was that B cell lymphopoiesis was present in the infant liver and persisted throughout the first few months of life. For infants with BA, the concentrations of self-reactive natural IgM antibodies were decreased, whereas the pathogenic high-affinity IgG antibodies were increased in comparison to control subjects. Natural IgM, constituting the majority of the total circulating IgM ( Weller et al., 2004 93. Weller, S. ∙ Braun, M.C. ∙ Tan, B.K. ... Human blood IgM “memory” B cells are circulating splenic marginal zone B cells harboring a prediversified immunoglobulin repertoire Blood. 2004; 104 :3647-3654 Crossref Scopus (655) PubMed Google Scholar ), plays protective roles in immune defenses against common infections and autoimmune disease development ( Bove et al., 2018 9. Bove, K.E. ∙ Sheridan, R. ∙ Fei, L. ... Hepatic Hilar Lymph Node Reactivity at Kasai Portoenterostomy for Biliary Atresia: Correlations With Age, Outcome, and Histology of Proximal Biliary Remnant Pediatr. Dev. Pathol. 2018; 21 :29-40 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the exact causes leading to natural IgM deficiency are unknown, the consequences would be consistent with infection triggering BA pathogenesis ( Asai et al., 2015 2. Asai, A. ∙ Miethke, A. ∙ Bezerra, J.A. Pathogenesis of biliary atresia: defining biology to understand clinical phenotypes Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2015; 12 :342-352 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bessho and Bezerra, 2011 6. Bessho, K. ∙ Bezerra, J.A. Biliary atresia: will blocking inflammation tame the disease? Annu. Rev. Med. 2011; 62 :171-185 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, myeloid-derived TNFSF13B (BAFF) might contribute to an increased production of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies in infants with BA ( Lesley et al., 2004 46. Lesley, R. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Kalled, S.L. ... Reduced competitiveness of autoantigen-engaged B cells due to increased dependence on BAFF Immunity. 2004; 20 :441-453 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mariette et al., 2003 57. Mariette, X. ∙ Roux, S. ∙ Zhang, J. ... The level of BLyS (BAFF) correlates with the titre of autoantibodies in human Sjögren’s syndrome Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2003; 62 :168-171 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, the nature of ex-bone marrow B cell lymphopoiesis ( O’Byrne et al., 2019 64. O’Byrne, S. ∙ Elliott, N. ∙ Rice, S. ... Discovery of a CD10-negative B-progenitor in human fetal life identifies unique ontogeny-related developmental programs Blood. 2019; 134 :1059-1071 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the activation and tolerance mechanisms, as well as the clinical relevance of these findings to other pediatric liver and autoimmune diseases, warrant further studies.
We also demonstrated that temporarily depleting B cells by a single dose of RTX was safe and well tolerated in infants with BA. RTX administration spared the pro-B cells and PCs but depleted immature, naive, and memory B cells from circulation and liver of infants with BA. The beneficial effects are likely manifold, including halting the increase of IgG autoantibodies and preventing the expansion of cytotoxic T cells. Additional unexpected advantageous outcomes include increasing the inflammatory potential of macrophages, promoting the repairing function of CX3CR1 + CD8Teff and cir-NK cells, and restoring the scavenger and regenerative function of Kupffer cells.
In summary, we provide comprehensive immune pathogenic mechanisms that can lead to rapid liver failure in infants with BA. In particular, we propose that B-cell-modifying therapies may ameliorate BA pathology.

The Medical Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center approved the study procedures and clinical trial (ID: 201948701). The implementations were in concordance with the International Ethical Guidelines for Research Involving Human Subjects as stated in the Helsinki Declaration. The legal guardians of all participants signed the consent forms.
The electronic medical records (EMRs) of children with BA (n = 927), CC (n = 248), physiological jaundice (n = 9,297) and non-disease control subjects (n = 2,471) between January 2011 to August 2019 were retrospectively examined. Baseline demographics, laboratory test results and clinical outcomes of these subjects were retrieved.
To study immune pathogenesis, a cohort of children from the Department of Pediatric Surgery at Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center were enrolled between January 2019 and June 2020. BA (n = 152) (median age: 2 months, ranging from 1 month to 7 months; male/female = 0.92) was diagnosed when intrahepatic biliary tree and/or extrahepatic bile duct could not be observed with intraoperative cholangiography. For controls, children with normal liver function but requiring surgery for choledochal cyst (CC) (n = 63) (median age: 25 months, ranging from 2 months to 12 years; male/female = 0.43) or non-cholestatic diseases (n = 35) (median age: 4 years, ranging from 1 months to 13 years; male/female = 1.06) were included.
For assessing the therapeutic effects of Rituximab, an open label clinical study was conducted in 4 patients with BA. Rituximab was administered at 187.5 mg/m 2 5-7 days before or after the Kasai’s operation. The postoperative (PO) course involved nasogastric drainage and intravenous fluids until there was evidence of bowel function. Ursodeoxycholic acid (10-15 mg/kg bid PO) was added after the infants had begun normal feeding. Methylprednisolone injection was given 5 th −7 th days PO at 4 mg/kg qd followed by 2 mg/kg qd, and tablets were given orally 2 mg/kg qd for 3 weeks. Cefoperazone and metronidazole were administered for 10-14 days PO. Cefixime and TMPco were alternately administered for 6 months to minimize the risk of cholangitis. Blood B cell counts, laboratory indices and adverse events were monitored before, during and after Rituximab administration.
The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Guangzhou Medical University (ID: 2019-471). BALB/c mice were purchased from Laboratory Animal Center of Guangdong Province. Breeding pairs (1 male and 2 or 3 female mice) were housed in microisolator cages in laminar flow hoods. Maximized number of pregnancies were obtained within the same week. Once the females were pregnant, they were placed into separate housings. All newborn pups (aged 1 day) were randomly assinged to control, RRV and therapeutic groups. All experimental procedures were carried out according to the institutional guidelines.
LX-2 cells obtained from ATCC were grown in RPMI1640, supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM glutamine and 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO 2 at 100% humidity.
Immune cells from peripheral blood and liver biopsies were isolated by flow-cytometry based sorting.
The LASSO-regression model was applied to identify BA specific clinical indices. Only indices with records in more than 20% of the 12,943 EMR reports were included in the machine learning process. A subset of 10% of the subjects was randomly selected as the dataset for training process. The 58 significant coefficients (clinical indices) determined by the regression model were selected as group specific parameters. Among those 58 coefficients, the r-GT, ALT, AST, TBA and DBIL showed significantly elevated levels in infants with BA, which was consistent with clinical consensus ( Figure 1 A). The rest 90% of the subjects were utilized to validate the predictive performance of the BA-specific clinical indices to distinguish children with BA from CC, physiologic jaundice and non-diseased control subjects ( Figure S1 B).
Liver biopsies were obtained from patients during laparoscopy or Kasai’s operation. The specimens were collected in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 1 mM EDTA (pH = 8.0) (FACS buffer). Each sample was sent for histological assessment and the sparing tissue was used for the isolation of intrahepatic lymphocytes. Specifically, hepatic tissues (0.05-0.2 g) were washed three times with FACS buffer to eliminate blood contaminations and remove intravascular lymphocytes. Samples were transferred onto 70 μm cell strainers pre-wetted with 2 mL FACS buffer that were placed in 50 mm Petri dishes, cut into < 1 mm 3 pieces with ophthalmic scissors and minced gently with plunger of 1 mL insulin syringe. An extra 2 mL FACS buffer was added to wash the cell strainer. A total 4 mL cell suspensions were filtered through cell strainer (Falcon, Round-Bottom Tubes with Cell Strainer Cap). To remove majority of the hepatocytes, cells were centrifuged at 50 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was collected for further centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (liver homogenates) was saved in −80 þC freezer for further laboratory tests. Cell pellets were re-suspended with 1-2 mL red cell lysis buffer for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Prior to centrifugation, 10 mL FACS buffer was added to stop the reaction. Cell pellets were re-suspended in 10 mL 35% Percoll for centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 30 min at 4þC. The resulted cell pellets (lymphocytes) were washed once in PBS and re-suspended in FACS buffer, which were ready for phenotypic flow cytometry assays.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or hepatic lymphocytes were incubated for 45 min at 4þC with saturating concentrations of fluorescently labeled antibodies and analyzed on a FACSAria SORP flow cytometer (BD Science). For T cell phenotype analysis, cells were stained with anti-CD45, CD3, CD8a, CD4, CD25, CX3CR1, CD69, CD45RA, CCR7 antibodies. The proportions of CX3CR1 + CD8Teff cells (CD45 + CD3 + CD8 + CD4 - CD45RA + CCR7 - CX3CR1 + CD69 +/− ), CD69 + CD8 + Trm cells (CD45 + CD3 + CD8 + CD4 - CD45RA - CCR7 + CX3CR1 - CD69 + ) in CD8 + T cell cells were analyzed. For B cell phenotype analysis, cells were stained with anti-CD45, CD3, CD19, CD20, CD10, CD71, CD38, IgD, IgM, CD34, CD138, CD21, CD27, FCRL5, IgG, IgA antibodies. B cells at differentiation stages in liver were identified by surface markers as described previously ( Bendall et al., 2014 5. Bendall, S.C. ∙ Davis, K.L. ∙ Amir, A.D. ...

Single cell suspensions for liver samples were prepared and seeded onto a 96-well plate (2 × 10 6 /well) followed by incubation with 5 μL/well E. coli slurry for 2 hours in the cell incubator. After washing the wells three times with ice-cold Phagocytosis Assay Buffer, cells from human samples were surface-stained with CD68 and VSIG4, and cells from mice were surface-stained with CD45, CD3, CD19, CD11b, F4/80, Iy6G, Ly6C. Gating strategies for human and mice Kupffer cells were shown in Figures 4 E and S6 E, respectively. Stained cells were analyzed immediately with a FACSCalibur. Prior to flow cytometric acquisition, PI was added for exclusion of dead cells. The phagocytosis activity was expressed as proportion of FITC + Kupffer cells.
The cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) technology was utilized with modifications to pulldown ASCL2-binding chromatin regions ( Kaya-Okur et al., 2019 35. Kaya-Okur, H.S. ∙ Wu, S.J. ∙ Codomo, C.A. ... CUT&Tag for efficient epigenomic profiling of small samples and single cells Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1930 Crossref Scopus (987) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads (ConA beads) (10 μL per sample) were activated by washing with Binding Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MnCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 ) twice and gently re-suspended in Binding Buffer. NK cells were sorted from human cord blood and washed with ice-cold PBS twice. Around 2 × 10 5 cells were washed with 1 mL Wash Buffer (250 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 1 × Protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at 1,600 r.p.m for 5 min at RT. Cells were re-suspended with 100 μL Wash Buffer, gently mixed with 10 μL activated ConA beads, and incubated at RT for 15 min. The bead-bound cells were rinsed with magnetic stand and res-suspended with 50 μL ice-cold antibody buffer (20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.05% Digitonin, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 1 × Protease inhibitor cocktail) supplemented with 1 μL anti-ASLC2 antibody. The cell-beads-antibody mixture was incubated at RT for 2 hours with gentle rotation. 1 st antibody was removed with magnetic stand. 2 nd antibody (1 μg) were diluted in 50 μL of Dig-wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.05% Digitonin, 1 × Protease inhibitor cocktail). Cells were incubated in the 2 nd antibody solution for 1 hour at RT. Cells were washed three times with Dig-wash buffer and incubated with 0.04 μM Hyperactive pA-Tn5 Transposase adaptor complex mix (TTE mix) in 100 μL of Dig-300 buffer (20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.01% Digitonin, 1 × Protease inhibitor cocktail) at RT for 1 hour. Cells were then washed three times with Dig-300 buffer and resuspended in 300 μL of tagmentation buffer (10 mM MgCl 2 in Dig-300 buffer) and incubated at 37 þC for 1 hour. Tagmentation was terminated by adding 10 μL of 0.5 M EDTA, 3 μL of 10% SDS and 5 μL of 10 mg/mL Proteinase K to the sample and incubated at 50 þC for 1 hour. DNA was purified with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation, followed by SYBR qPCR detection.
HEK293T cells with transient expression of Flag-tagged KLF2 were used for ChIP assay as there’s no usable IP-grade anti-KLF2 antibody. ChIP assay was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) according to manufacturer’s instructions. HEK293T cells with overexpression of KLF2-3 × Flag were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 þC. The anti-Flag antibody was applied for immunoprecipitation.
Liver Biopsies from 19 children (6 Ctrl-CC, 4 Ctrl-other, 6 BA, and 3 BA receiving RTX treatment) were processed following the steps above. Single cell suspensions were subsequently stained with antibody (CD45-BV421, 0.5 μL/10 6 cells), after which they were sorted into Eppendorf tubes that were pre-wetted with fetal bovine serum (FBS) using a FACSAria SORP flow cytometer (BD Science). Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide (PI). Single-cell 5’ RNA sequencing libraries for each of the 21 samples were separately constructed for immune (CD45 + ) cells according to the protocols of the Chromium Single Cell 5' Library kit (10x GENOMICS). Briefly, single-cell suspension mixed with RT-PCR master mix was loaded with partitioning oil and nanoliter-scale gel beads into a single-cell 5’ chip according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate a single multiplexed library, RNA transcripts were uniquely barcoded within single cells and reverse-transcribed into barcoded cDNAs, which were purified, amplified, end-repaired, and ligated with illumine adapters. TCR - and BCR - enriched libraries were generated with aliquots from each of the aforementioned cDNAs using the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment kit. All the libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform.
The off-machine 5¢-expression sequencing data was demultiplexed and aligned to the human transcriptome (build GRCh38) using the Cell Ranger v2.1.1 (10x Genomics). The generated outputs for the 21 samples were pooled to obtain a combined raw expression matrix (gene counts versus cells) using the function cellranger aggr . The unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was transformed into Seurat objects using the R package Seurat v 3.1.2 ( Butler et al., 2018 10. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6227) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stuart et al., 2019 79. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e1821 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7328) PubMed Google Scholar ). Qualified cells with detected gene number between 200 and 5,000, UMI number below 50,000 and percentage of mitochondrial genes below 12.5% were kept. After quality control, a dataset of 159,622 cells × 21,173 genes were obtained for downstream analysis. The raw gene expression measurements for each cell were normalized by dividing them by the total expression followed by scale factor-multiplying ( × 10,000) and log-transformation In (UMI-per-10,000+1) with the function NormalizeData in the Seurat toolkit.
To eliminate batch effects, a reference Seurat object was generated by identifying anchor genes between samples. Briefly, we split the combined Seurat object into a list of Seurat objects with each dataset as an element by running the command of SplitObject . Each Seurat dataset within the list was normalized for identification of variable genes by running NormalizeData and FindVariableFeatures (xxx, selection.method = “vst,” nfeatures = 2000). Next, anchors were identified using the command FindIntegrationAnchors (object.list = BA.list, dims = 1:30) . These anchors were then passed to the function IntegrateData (anchorset = anchors, dims = 1:30) , which returned a Seurat object holding an integrated batch effects corrected expression matrix. An “integrated” assay with the integrated expression matrix was contained in the Seurat object. The original uncorrected values were stored in the object in the “RNA” assay, ready to be switched back and forth.
The new integrated expression matrix was used for downstream analysis. First, we scaled the integrated data for PCA and tSNE visualization. The cells were then clustered by cell type, rather than by batch effects. Major cell types (T cells, B cells and plasma cells, Natural killer (NK) and NKT cells, and myeloid cells) were identified by mapping canonical marker genes in the two-dimensional t-SNE map ( Tables S1 and S2 ).
The cell identities for Seurat object generated with cells from two BA infants treated with Rituximab were determined by the methods of label transfer in Seurat v 3.1.2. Briefly, transferred anchors between the reference Seurat object and objects from Rituximab group were calculated using anchorset = FindTransferAnchors (reference = BA, query = query_obj, dims = 1:30) . Predicted cell identities were determined by passing the anchorset mentioned above to the function TransferData (anchorset = anchorset, refdata = BA.downsample$cluster, dims = 1:30).
Functional sub-clusters within each of major cell types were partitioned and analyzed. We performed PCA using the variably expressed genes for each of the major cell type objects under “integrated” assay mode. Significant principal components, selected by looking at the elbow position on standard deviation graphs of PCAs, were used for subsequent clustering and t-SNE visualization. Seurat function FindClusters was utilized with suitable resolution to identify sub-clusters within each major cell type. Cells with expression of double-lineage genes, including CD3 + CD19 + cells, CD68 + CD19 + cells, were excluded to eliminate potential doublet capture bias. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each of the sub-clusters were identified using FindAllMarkers function under RNA assay mode. The test method used for FindAllMarkers was the Wilcoxon rank sum test . We defined each cell sub-cluster based on the expression of canonical markers ( Table S1 ). Any transcriptomic comparisons, e.g., between control and BA, between liver and PBMC group, were performed using function FindMarkers (object = obj, ident.1 = ident.1, ident.2 = ident.2, verbose = FALSE) under RNA assa y mode.
Single-cell trajectory analysis was performed with the Monocle package (v2.8.0) ( Qiu et al., 2017 71. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (2116) PubMed Google Scholar ). The starting subject CellDataSet class was created with normalized expression cells × genes matrix. The DEGs across sub-clusters were identified by performing differentialGeneTest function and subsequently used as genes to define cell progress. DDRTree incorporated in the reduceDimension function was applied for data dimension reduction. Cells were then ordered in pesudotime with the orderCells function. The trajectory was visualized in two-dimensional space by running plot_cell_trajectory function.
To measure TF activity, SCENIC ( Aibar et al., 2017 1. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (2534) PubMed Google Scholar ) was applied to deduce gene regulatory networks across cell clusters. Briefly, genes co-expressed with TFs were identified using the function runGenie3 in the GENIE3 package. The aforementioned co-expressed genes were converted into co-expression modules by running the function runSCENIC_1_coexNetwork2modules . Potential direct-binding target genesets (regulons) were identified using the function runSCENIC_2_createRegulons implemented in RcisTarget package. The regulon activity was then scored for each cell by performing runSCENIC_3_scoreCells function in the R package AUCell . The AUCell matrices were retrieved for heatmap plotting. Genie3Weight values for pairs of TF-target genes were utilized for regulatory network analysis and visualization with Cytoscape (v3.7.0) ( Shannon et al., 2003 75. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (32549) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Single-cell sequencing data of BCR and TCR were analyzed with the cellranger vdj pipeline with parameter setting of –chain = IG and –chain = TR , respectively. cellranger vdj pipeline performs V(D)J sequence assembly and paired cell-by-cell clonotype calling. The outputs of cellranger vdj include the productive nucleotide sequences and translated amino acid sequences of the CDR3 region for TCRs (a and b chains) and BCRs (heavy and light chains). The information of TCR or BCR for each cell was matched with its 5¢ expression data via the unique cellular barcode. A clonotype was defined as identical CDR3 sequences of a-b TCR pair or heavy-light BCR pair. Cells with the same clonotype were identified as clonal TCRs or BCRs. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) with a chain composed of V segment TRAV1-2 were excluded from the downstream analysis. 1) Clonal expansion Cells with the same clonotype ID within one T or B cell sub-cluster were counted for each sample. Percentage of expanded clonotype ( P exp ) was calculated as below: P e x p = ∑ 𝑚 𝑖 = 1 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑖 𝑁 × 1 0 0 ⁢ % , i n w h i c h
m: number of clonotype ID with attributed cell number > = 2;
n i : attributed cell number for clonotype i;
N: total cell number in a sub-cluster for a sample.
Two-sided Student’s t test was applied for P exp comparison between control and BA group. The mean P exp value for each sub-cluster from control or BA group was calculated and used for heatmap plotting. 2) Clonal transition Percentage of clonal transition between any two (C1 and C2) of the T or B cell sub-clusters for each sample ( P tran C1-C2 ) was calculated as below: P t r a n C ⁢ 1 − C ⁢ 2 = ∑ 𝑚 𝑖 = 1 ( 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑖 − 𝐶 ⁢ 1 + 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑖 − 𝐶 ⁢ 2 ) 𝑁 , i n w h i c h m: kinds of clonotype IDs with presence in both C1 and C2; ni-C1: attributed cell number for clnonotype i in C1; ni-C2: attributed cell number for clonotype i in C2; N: total T or B cell number from one sample
Mean P tran values were calculated for BA and control group and subjected for network plotting with Cytoscape (v3.7.0). 3) BCR V × J rearrangement index During B cell development, gene loci encoding light chain BCRs undergo frequent VJ recombination events. If light chain generated from primary recombination turns out to be inefficient to erase autoreactivity, the IgL locus would initiate secondary recombination to increase the chance to produce non-autoreactive BCR. Primary recombination is prone to take place between v- and j-gene adjacent to thev-j boundary, while secondary recombination would occur at v- and j-gene relatively remote to the v-j boundary. Based on the assumption, we defined the BCR V × J rearrangement index to continuously measure the likelihood of a given light chain is derived from advanced V × J recombination. For the light chain of a given BCR, the V × J rearrangement index was calculated as below: V × J − i n d e x = o r d e r − v × o r d e r − j , i n w h i c h order-v: the order of the given v gene among v-genes loci on human chromosome. order-j: the order of the given j gene among j-genes loci on human chromosome. 4) Analysis of the autoimmune characteristics of BCR repertoires CDR3 length and number of positive charged amino acids within CDR3 region were counted for each heavy chain and compared between BA and control group. For each BCR, number of mutated nucleotides within Fv region in comparison with respective reference germline sequence were counted.
We employed a method called CellPhoneDB tailored for single-cell transcriptome data to explore cell-cell communications based on the manually curated repository of interacting ligands and receptors ( https://www.cellphonedb.org ; Vento-Tormo et al., 2018 90. Vento-Tormo, R. ∙ Efremova, M. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell reconstruction of the early maternal-fetal interface in humans Nature. 2018; 563 :347-353 Crossref Scopus (1309) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the method infers potential cell-cell interactions based on expression of interacting ligand-receptor pairs between two clusters. The gene encoding receptor or ligand included in the downstream analysis should be expressed by more than 30% cells in a specific cluster. To identify the significance of a ligand-receptor pair between two clusters, the permutation test was performed by randomly assigning the cluster labels of each cell for 1,000 times. An empirical P value was determined by the rank of actual average expression of a given ligand and receptor pair in two clusters among the 1,000 permutated results.
Total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and preamplification were performed with Discover-scTM WTA Kit V2 (Vazyme). RNA purity, concentration, and integrity were determined by NanoDrop® spectrophotometers (Thermo Fisher, MA, USA), Qubit® RNA assay kit on Qubit® 3.0 Flurometer (Life technologies, CA, USA), and RNA Nano 6000 Assay kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), respectively. Library was prepared using VAHTS mRNA-seq v2 library Prep Kit for Illumina® (Vazyme, NR601) following manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were then sequenced on Illumina Hiseq X Ten platform with 150 bp paired-end module. Clean reads were obtained by filtering the raw reads with cutadapt (v1.2) ( Martin, 2011 59. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet J. 2011; 17 :10 Crossref Google Scholar ). Clean reads were aligned to reference genome (GRCh38) using Hisat2 (v2.0.5) ( Kim et al., 2015 38. Kim, D. ∙ Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. HISAT: a fast spliced aligner with low memory requirements Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :357-360 Crossref Scopus (13773) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pertea et al., 2016 70. Pertea, M. ∙ Kim, D. ∙ Pertea, G.M. ... Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1650-1667 Crossref Scopus (3950) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mapped reads of each sample were assembled using Stringtie (v1.3.3) with a reference-based approach ( Pertea et al., 2016 70. Pertea, M. ∙ Kim, D. ∙ Pertea, G.M. ... Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :1650-1667 Crossref Scopus (3950) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene counts were quantified for each sample using the R package Rsubread (v2.0.1) with bam files as the input ( Liao et al., 2019 47. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. The R package Rsubread is easier, faster, cheaper and better for alignment and quantification of RNA sequencing reads Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :e47 Crossref Scopus (1334) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequently subjected to differential expressed genes (DEGs) calling using DESeq2 (v1.18.1) (absolute log2FoldChange > = 1, adjusted p value < 0.05) ( Love et al., 2014 51. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48497) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cuffdiff (v1.3.0) was applied to calculate Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped (FPKMs) for coding genes in each sample ( Trapnell et al., 2012 83. Trapnell, C. ∙ Roberts, A. ∙ Goff, L. ... Differential gene and transcript expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with TopHat and Cufflinks Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :562-578 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ).
R v3.5.3 (Foundation for Statistical Computing) was applied for the statistical analyses and graphics production with scRNA-seq data. For the experimental data, GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software) was used to perform statistical analyses and graphics production. All the statistical analyses were performed in two-sided manner. Detailed descriptions of statistical tests are speciðed in the Results section and in the Figure Legends.
The clinical trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000031738).
