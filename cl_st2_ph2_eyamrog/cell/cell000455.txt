Title: Ancient and modern genomes unravel the evolutionary history of the rhinoceros family


Abstract: Summary

Only five species of the once-diverse Rhinocerotidae remain, making the reconstruction of their evolutionary history a challenge to biologists since Darwin. We sequenced genomes from five rhinoceros species (three extinct and two living), which we compared to existing data from the remaining three living species and a range of outgroups. We identify an early divergence between extant African and Eurasian lineages, resolving a key debate regarding the phylogeny of extant rhinoceroses. This early Miocene (∼16 million years ago [mya]) split post-dates the land bridge formation between the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian landmasses. Our analyses also show that while rhinoceros genomes in general exhibit low levels of genome-wide diversity, heterozygosity is lowest and inbreeding is highest in the modern species. These results suggest that while low genetic diversity is a long-term feature of the family, it has been particularly exacerbated recently, likely reflecting recent anthropogenic-driven population declines.

Section: Introduction

Understanding the relationships among rhinoceros species and when they diverged has been a question addressed by evolutionary biologists since the dawn of the field. Darwin himself discussed the topic in 1842 as one of a handful of examples in his short treatise on evolution that preceded On the Origin of Species in 1859 ( Darwin, 1909 25. Darwin, F. (Editor) The foundations of the origin of species. Two essays written in 1842 and 1844 Cambridge University Press, 1909 Crossref Google Scholar ). Although rhinoceroses were once a diverse clade, extant rhinoceroses comprise only five species, all of which are highly endangered and global priorities for conservation. Rhinocerotoidea, the clade including the rhinoceros family (Rhinocerotidae), diverged from tapirs 55–60 million years ago (mya) in either Eurasia or North America ( Bai et al., 2020 6. Bai, B. ∙ Meng, J. ∙ Zhang, C. ... The origin of Rhinocerotoidea and phylogeny of Ceratomorpha (Mammalia, Perissodactyla) Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :509 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). The family subsequently radiated into at least 100 species distributed across Africa, Eurasia, North, and Central America ( Cerdeño, 1998 20. Cerdeño, E. Diversity and evolutionary trends of the Family Rhinocerotidae (Perissodactyla) Palaeogeogr. Palaeoclimatol. Palaeoecol. 1998; 141 :13-34 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) and included some of the largest land mammals that ever lived. Most rhinocerotids went extinct prior to the Pleistocene, with just nine species surviving into the Late Pleistocene, during which additional extinctions occurred. These consist of the five extant species, as well as the now-extinct Siberian unicorn ( Elasmotherium sibiricum ), Merck’s rhinoceros ( Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis ) and its relative Stephanorhinus hemitoechus (not studied here), and the woolly rhinoceros ( Coelodonta antiquitatis ).
Despite decades of study, fundamental questions remain regarding the evolutionary relationships among the extant rhinoceros species and their recently extinct relatives. Furthermore, several rhinoceros species lack available genomic resources that would allow applications, including DNA-based monitoring, conservation management, and environmental DNA studies. To address these questions and needs, we analyzed a genome dataset representing eight rhinoceros species ( Figure 1 ), including all seven genera that survived into the Late Pleistocene ( Cerdeño, 1998 20. Cerdeño, E. Diversity and evolutionary trends of the Family Rhinocerotidae (Perissodactyla) Palaeogeogr. Palaeoclimatol. Palaeoecol. 1998; 141 :13-34 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Our data include the five extant rhinoceros species represented by four de novo genome assemblies of black ( Diceros bicornis ), white ( Ceratotherium simum ), Sumatran ( Dicerorhinus sumatrensis ), and greater one-horned ( Rhinoceros unicornis , also known as Indian) rhinoceroses and a resequenced genome of a Javan rhinoceros ( R. sondaicus ). The Javan rhinoceros genome was retrieved from a museum specimen dating to 1838 and resequenced to high coverage (25×). In addition, we sequenced the genomes of three extinct rhinoceros species from Late Pleistocene fossils that are close to, or beyond, the radiocarbon dating limit of ∼50 thousand years ago (kya), specifically a Siberian unicorn, a Merck’s rhinoceros, and a woolly rhinoceros, sequenced to 9×, 12×, and 35× coverage, respectively ( Table S1 ).

Section: Results

Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phylogenetic relationships within living Rhinocerotidae: (1) the “horn hypothesis,” which groups the two-horned rhinoceros species together, specifically placing the Sumatran rhinoceros as sister to the African Diceroti (black and white rhinoceroses) and has been supported by morphology ( Antoine et al., 2010 1.

Early Pleistocene enamel proteome from Dmanisi resolves Stephanorhinus phylogeny Nature. 2019; 574 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ); (2) the “geographical hypothesis,” which places the Asian species together, with Sumatran as sister to the greater one-horned and Javan rhinoceroses, and is based on morpho-anatomical evidence ( Antoine et al., 2021 3.

Soc. 2020; 190 :372-383 Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar ). These conflicting hypotheses emphasize the limitations of using lower-resolution markers in reconstructing evolutionary relationships within Rhinocerotidae and highlight the potential of applying phylogenomic approaches. Prior studies have also debated the phylogenetic placement of the three extinct species included in this study. For example, the relationship of Merck’s and woolly rhinoceroses to each other, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the two African Diceroti remained contentious due to contrasting conclusions drawn from morpho-anatomical versus mitogenomic and paleoproteomic evidence ( Antoine et al., 2021 3.

To circumvent the problem of reference genome biases ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2017 41. Gopalakrishnan, S. ∙ Samaniego Castruita, J.A. ∙ Sinding, M.S. ... The wolf reference genome sequence ( Canis lupus lupus ) and its implications for Canis spp. population genomics BMC Genomics. 2017; 18 :495 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Heintzman et al., 2017 46. Heintzman, P.D. ∙ Zazula, G.D. ∙ MacPhee, R. ... A new genus of horse from Pleistocene North America eLife. 2017; 6 :e29944 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S1 A and S1B), we conducted whole-genome alignments for the eight rhinoceros species using domestic horse ( Equus caballus ) as an outgroup. We then inferred a genome-wide species tree summarizing the phylogenetic signal from individual gene trees based on 22,066 100-kb genomic windows. Our phylogenomic analysis identified three major clades within the subfamily Rhinocerotinae and provided strong support for the geographical hypothesis of rhinoceros evolution. A clade comprising the two African species Diceros bicornis and Ceratotherium simum , the Diceroti, is the sister lineage to the remaining rhinoceroses in our dataset (with the exception of the Siberian unicorn). A second clade includes the Sumatran, Merck’s, and woolly rhinoceroses (hereafter referred to as the Dicerorhinus-Coelodonta-Stephanorhinus [ DCS ] clade), all of which have current or past geographic ranges that include parts of Asia. The third clade includes the two Rhinoceros species ( Figure 2 A). Thus, the principal divergence among the rhinoceros lineages is related to the geographical division between species on the African and Eurasian continents.
Our phylogenomic analyses confirm prior conclusions based on morphological and biomolecular evidence ( Figure 2 A) that place the extinct Siberian unicorn as outgroup to the subfamily Rhinocerotinae (P.-O.A., unpublished data; Becker et al., 2013 7. Becker, D. ∙ Antoine, P. ∙ Maridet, O. A new genus of Rhinocerotidae (Mammalia, Perissodactyla) from the Oligocene of Europe J. Syst. Palaeontology. 2013; 11 :947-972 Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar ; Kosintsev et al., 2019 61. Kosintsev, P. ∙ Mitchell, K.J. ∙ Devièse, T. ... Evolution and extinction of the giant rhinoceros Elasmotherium sibiricum sheds light on late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2019; 3 :31-38 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within the DCS clade, we found strong support for the Sumatran rhinoceros as sister to the clade that includes the extinct Merck’s and woolly rhinoceroses. A remaining challenge is understanding the relationships of more ancient extinct species, for which DNA remains unrecoverable. As our findings suggest that results based purely on morphology (the horn hypothesis) are not supported, attempting to fill in the rest of the phylogeny based solely on the morphology of extinct taxa may prove difficult.
While we were able to resolve a genome-wide rhinoceros species tree, we uncovered significant phylogenetic discordance across the rhinoceros genomes, suggesting gene flow or incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) among taxa. While this topology represents the dominant signal of species relationships across the whole genome, analyses of individual chromosomes did not always recover the same topology ( Figure S1 C). Most prominently, we observed that the species-tree position of the DCS clade was supported by only ∼45% of the individual sliding-window trees, which is substantially fewer than recovered for other nodes in the phylogeny ( Figure 2 B). Because a genomic region of 100 kb in length may contain multiple recombination breakpoints, we also inferred gene trees using 5-kb alignments randomly subsampled from within each 100-kb sliding window. The results corroborated the phylogenetic discordance discovered in the initial dataset ( Figure S1 D). We then simulated the gene tree distribution expected under a hypothesis of genetic drift with ILS and compared this to the empirical data. We found disagreement between the simulated and empirical data, suggestive of both ILS and gene flow as the cause of the diminished support for the species tree. We found in the empirical data an excess of gene tree topologies supporting the placement of the Sumatran rhinoceros as sister to the other species of the Rhinocerotinae subfamily, as observed previously in some mitochondrial phylogenies ( Willerslev et al., 2009 133. Willerslev, E. ∙ Gilbert, M.T.P. ∙ Binladen, J. ... Analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes from extinct and extant rhinoceroses reveals lack of phylogenetic resolution BMC Evol. Biol. 2009; 9 :95 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Margaryan et al., 2020 76. Margaryan, A. ∙ Sinding, M.S. ∙ Liu, S. ... Recent mitochondrial lineage extinction in the critically endangered Javan rhinoceros Zool. J. Linn. Soc. 2020; 190 :372-383 Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar ; Figure 2 B).
To further explore the origins of the phylogenomic discordances, we used D-statistics analyses to differentiate ancient gene flow events from ILS ( Green et al., 2010 42. Green, R.E. ∙ Krause, J. ∙ Briggs, A.W. ... A draft sequence of the Neandertal genome Science. 2010; 328 :710-722 Crossref Scopus (2197) PubMed Google Scholar ). The use of this method can be problematic when applied to relatively divergent species due both to possible violations in assumptions such as equal mutation rates and the infinite sites model and biases derived from the mapping of resequenced data to a reference genome ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Despite these potential sources of error, the D-statistics are congruent with the phylogenomic analyses in suggesting that gene flow and ILS occurred between the ancestors of the Diceroti and Rhinoceros species ( Figures 2 B and 2C). This gene flow may have been enabled by the Eurasian origin of both African species ( Antoine et al., 2021 3. Antoine, P.-O. ∙ Reyes, M.C. ∙ Amano, N. ... A new clade of rhinoceroses from the Pleistocene of Asia sheds light on mainland mammal dispersals to the Philippines Zool. J. Linn. Soc. 2021; Published online May 22, 2021 Crossref Google Scholar ; Geraads, 2005 37. Geraads, D. Pliocene Rhinocerotidae (Mammalia) from Hadar and Dikika (Lower Awash, Ethiopia), and a revision of the origin of modern african rhinos J. Vertebr.

Evol. 2020; 140 :102373 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our analyses also revealed an excess of shared derived alleles between the two extinct members of the DCS clade (Merck’s and woolly rhinoceroses) and both representatives of Rhinoceros , suggesting gene flow between these two pairs of lineages. We found no evidence of excess shared derived alleles between the Sumatran rhinoceros and either Rhinoceros species ( Figure S2 D), despite their closer geographic proximity ( Figure 1 ). This suggests either no gene flow or similar levels of gene flow between the Sumatran rhino and both Rhinoceros species. These differential patterns of gene flow may explain the discrepancy of the phylogenetic placement of the Sumatran rhinoceros as sister to the genus Rhinoceros based on nuclear DNA versus sister to all other members of the subfamily Rhinocerotinae in some mitochondrial phylogenies ( Willerslev et al., 2009 133. Willerslev, E. ∙ Gilbert, M.T.P. ∙ Binladen, J. ... Analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes from extinct and extant rhinoceroses reveals lack of phylogenetic resolution BMC Evol.

We used fossil data to calibrate our phylogeny and estimate lineage divergence times ( Figure 2 A). This resulted in a ∼65 mya estimate for the common ancestor of horses, tapirs, and rhinoceroses and a ∼36 mya estimate for the common ancestor of the extinct rhinoceros subfamily Elasmotheriinae and the extant subfamily Rhinocerotinae. The three major clades within the Rhinocerotinae subfamily diverged ∼16 mya ( Figure 2 A), at the end of the early Miocene and around the time of the Miocene climatic optimum (17–14 mya), a period that was ∼3°C–4°C warmer than present ( Lewis et al., 2008 64.

Commun. 2020; 11 :134 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Diversification occurred after the formation of the terrestrial connection between the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian landmasses ∼20 mya ( Van Couvering and Delson, 2020 121. Van Couvering, J.A. ∙ Delson, E. African land mammal ages J. Vertebr. Paleontol. 2020; 40 :e1803340 Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar ). We hypothesize that this land bridge enabled dispersal events followed by vicariance, as is well documented with the immigration into Africa from Eurasia of early rhinocerotids, giraffids, suids, and viverrids and the emigration from Africa to Eurasia of apes, deinotheres, and elephantoids, among others ( Van Couvering and Delson, 2020 121.

Previous genomic studies on black, white, and Sumatran rhinoceroses identified low levels of genetic diversity ( Mays et al., 2018 78. Mays, Jr., H.L. ∙ Hung, C.M. ∙ Shaner, P.J.L. ...

These findings are consistent with the observation that all extant rhinoceros species have gone through recent population size declines, even though some species (white and greater one-horned rhinoceroses) have since recovered ( Ellis and Talukdar, 2019 33.

However, low genetic diversity can also be a consequence of particular life-history traits and/or long-term small population size ( Westbury et al., 2018 130. Westbury, M.V. ∙ Hartmann, S. ∙ Barlow, A. ... Extended and continuous decline in effective population size results in low genomic diversity in the world’s rarest hyena species, the brown hyena Mol.

Mountain gorilla genomes reveal the impact of long-term population decline and inbreeding Science. 2015; 348 :242-245 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate this, we calculated genome-wide heterozygosity (GWH) for all eight rhinoceros species and compared these estimates with GWH in a range of other animal species, including ruminants and, more broadly, mammals. We assessed whether GWH levels are lower in genomes recovered from present-day animals (i.e., black, white, greater one-horned, and Sumatran rhinoceroses) compared to GWH in genomes recovered from specimens that pre-date the human-mediated declines during the last 100 years (i.e., the nearly 180-year-old Javan rhinoceros genome as well as the genomes from the three extinct species).
We estimated GWH based on transversions only to limit the potential influence of DNA damage on estimates from the ancient and historical genomes. However, for comparability with published results for other taxa, which incorporate all variable sites, we recalibrated our estimates based on the expected transition/transversion ratio (see Figure S3 A). Our results showed that present-day rhinoceros genomes exhibit significantly lower GWH compared to the historical Javan and extinct genomes (one-way ANOVA, n = 8, F = 7.4, p = 0.04). On the other hand, our comparison with a broad range of animals shows that rhinoceroses in general display comparatively low levels of GWH, especially relative to not only the combined dataset of all animals but also ruminants and other large herbivores ( Figure 3 A). The only mammalian family displaying lower average levels of GWH was the Felidae ( Figure S3 B), which is not unexpected, as carnivores/predators are generally less abundant than herbivores/prey ( Owen-Smith, 2015 89. Owen-Smith, N. Mechanisms of coexistence in diverse herbivore–carnivore assemblages: demographic, temporal and spatial heterogeneities affecting prey vulnerability Oikos. 2015; 124 :1417-1426 Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar ). These findings are robust to choice of reference genome used in our analyses (see Figure S3 C).
To better contextualize the observed levels of GWH, we characterized the inbreeding levels in our genomes through distributions of runs of homozygosity (ROH). To evaluate the robustness of our results, we first explored the effect of excluding transitions on ROH inference ( Figure S4 A). This analysis indicated that a reliance solely on transversions shifts the distribution of ROH segments to longer stretches but that this is only a problem for species with low overall GWH. Since all the resequenced genomes (Javan, Siberian unicorn, Merck’s, and woolly rhinoceroses) exhibit higher GWH than at least three of the de novo assembled genomes (black, white, Sumatran, and greater one-horned rhinoceros), a reliance solely on transversions for these individuals may somewhat artificially inflate the length of ROH segments but should not bias our overall interpretations.
We did not detect any ROH segments in the Siberian unicorn, which may reflect its exceptional phylogenetic distance to the white rhinoceros genome against which it was mapped, artificially inflating heterozygous sites ( Figure S3 C). In contrast, ROH segments >2 Mb were detected in all other rhinoceros species, where all species except the woolly rhinoceros also exhibited stretches as long as 5 Mb. However, we observed significantly higher inbreeding levels (one-way ANOVA, n = 7, F = 36.7, p = 0.002), which are proportional to the overall length of ROH segments, in the genomes from present-day rhinoceroses compared to the genomes of the historical Javan and extinct Merck’s and woolly rhinoceroses ( Figure 3 B).
Overall, the comparisons of GWH and inbreeding levels suggest that recent population declines caused by heavy anthropogenic pressure in the 20th century (e.g., Player, 1973 95. Player, I. The White Rhino Saga, 1st Stein and Day, 1973 Google Scholar ) resulted in marked losses in genetic diversity, as well as increased inbreeding levels. However, the genomes from historical and extinct species, which were sampled either prior to their recent population collapse or many thousands of years before their extinction, also exhibit low levels of GWH when compared to other animal species ( Figure 3 A). Moreover, the observation of a moderate amount of long ROH segments in the genomes from the Javan, Merck’s, and woolly rhinoceroses is consistent with background inbreeding in these species. We thus hypothesize that limited genetic diversity and moderate inbreeding levels are intrinsic features of rhinoceros life history, where low population densities and limited dispersal result in increased genetic drift as well as occasional mating between relatives.
To further assess the genomic background of the overall low GWH and moderate inbreeding levels in Rhinocerotidae, we modeled changes in effective population size (N e ) throughout the Pleistocene using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) model ( Li and Durbin, 2011 69. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Inference of human population history from individual whole-genome sequences Nature. 2011; 475 :493-496 Crossref Scopus (1029) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 ). Although previous studies have reconstructed the demographic histories for a subset of species, including black rhinoceros ( Moodley et al., 2020 82. Moodley, Y. ∙ Westbury, M.V. ∙ Russo, I.M. ... Interspecific gene flow and the evolution of specialisation in black and white rhinoceros Mol. Biol. Evol. 2020; 37 :3105-3117 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ), white rhinoceros ( Tunstall et al., 2018 120. Tunstall, T. ∙ Kock, R. ∙ Vahala, J. ... Evaluating recovery potential of the northern white rhinoceros from cryopreserved somatic cells Genome Res. 2018; 28 :780-788 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), Sumatran rhinoceros ( Mays et al., 2018 78. Mays, Jr., H.L. ∙ Hung, C.M. ∙ Shaner, P.J.L. ... Genomic analysis of demographic history and ecological niche modeling in the endangered Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :70-76.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), and woolly rhinoceros ( Lord et al., 2020 71. Lord, E. ∙ Dussex, N. ∙ Kierczak, M. ... Pre-extinction demographic stability and genomic signatures of adaptation in the woolly rhinoceros Curr. Biol. 2020; 30 :3871-3879.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), our combined analysis allows exploration of both shared and unique responses through time. Overall, it is striking that all eight species displayed either a general continual decrease in N e over the last two million years or a continuously small N e over extended time periods.
Previous studies have suggested that maintenance of a low population size over extended periods of time allows for the purging of deleterious alleles while keeping low genome-wide levels of genetic diversity ( Westbury et al., 2018 130. Westbury, M.V. ∙ Hartmann, S. ∙ Barlow, A. ... Extended and continuous decline in effective population size results in low genomic diversity in the world’s rarest hyena species, the brown hyena Mol.

Mountain gorilla genomes reveal the impact of long-term population decline and inbreeding Science. 2015; 348 :242-245 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our finding that all rhinoceros species have had a small N e during extended periods of their history could thus indicate a similar scenario.
To investigate how mutational load in Rhinocerotidae compares to other species, we calculated ratios of loss-of-function (LoF; generally highly deleterious) versus synonymous mutations for seven of the rhinoceros species and 30 mammalian species from diverse clades ( Table S4 ). The results show that the levels of mutational load in rhinoceroses fall within the range observed among other present-day mammals ( Figure 5 ). However, the extinct and historic rhinoceros genomes (Siberian unicorn, woolly, and Javan rhinoceroses) displayed a significantly higher number of LoF mutations ( Figure 5 ; one-way ANOVA, n = 7, F = 29.0, p = 0.003) compared to the present-day rhinoceros genomes (i.e., black, white, Sumatran, and greater one-horned rhinoceroses). We thus find no evidence for an accumulation of mutational load within the last decades for those species that have gone through recent population declines. Although speculative, we therefore hypothesize that extant rhinoceroses may have undergone some purging of mutational load in connection with their demographic declines in the last 100 years. However, this hypothesis requires further testing, for example through intra-specific comparisons of historical and modern genomes that span these declines and, in some cases, recoveries ( Sánchez-Barreiro et al., 2021 102. Sánchez-Barreiro, F. ∙ Gopalakrishnan, S. ∙ Ramos-Madrigal, J. ... Historical population declines prompted significant genomic erosion in the northern and southern white rhinoceros. Mol. Ecol. 2021; Published online June 27, 2021 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ; von Seth et al., 2021 124. von Seth, J. ∙ Dussex, N. ∙ Díez-Del-Molino, D. ... Genomic insights into the conservation status of the world’s last remaining Sumatran rhinoceros populations Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :2393 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Meanwhile, it is worth noting that some of the species used in the analysis were mapped onto their closely related species with available reference genomes, and the qualities of genome assemblies and annotations vary between species as well, both of which could influence the accuracy of gene effect estimation.

Section: Discussion

Our combined rhinoceros genome dataset represents a valuable resource for both the current and future study of the evolution and biology of these species, including characterization of the genetic basis of rhinoceros phenotypes ( Table S5 ). For example, we uncovered frameshift mutations in IFT43 (intraflagellar transport 43) that could contribute to rhinoceroses’ poor eyesight. IFT43 is involved in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are important for the development and function of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) ( Arts et al., 2011 4. Arts, H.H. ∙ Bongers, E.M.H.F. ∙ Mans, D.A. ... C14ORF179 encoding IFT43 is mutated in Sensenbrenner syndrome J. Med. Genet. 2011; 48 :390-395 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In the case of the Javan and greater one-horned rhinoceros, our genome sequences also provide a basis for further species-specific conservation genetic analyses. By analyzing this dataset, we resolved a long-standing debate related to the evolutionary history of living and recently extinct rhinoceroses and provided evidence that relatively low genomic heterozygosity and moderate inbreeding levels may represent their long-term natural state. These findings suggest that low levels of diversity and high inbreeding observed in present-day rhinoceros genomes can only partially be attributed to recent declines. This may be positive news for conservation, since it implies that recent declines may have had less impact on the genetic aspects of population viability than previously thought. Nonetheless, extant rhinoceroses undoubtedly face enormous challenges in the future, principally due to anthropogenic and environmental effects. A major priority for rhinoceros conservation will be to halt illegal poaching and ensure that there is sufficient carrying capacity for population recovery. Our study highlights how genomics can complement such actions by enabling monitoring of ongoing changes in genetic variation, inbreeding, and mutational load.
Given the historic and ancient nature of the specimens from four of the species studied, their DNA quality was not suitable for de novo assembly; thus, their genome sequences were recovered through mapping against other species. This process can introduce biases in downstream analyses that can arise due to differential mapping efficiencies influenced by phylogenetic distance to the reference genome, ancient DNA damage, and short read lengths. Therefore, although we took several steps to alleviate such influences, we highlight that this should be kept in mind. Furthermore, it should be noted that the rhinoceros family was once a speciose group, and only a small fraction of these were studied here. Thus, given that we lack genome sequences from the majority of the clade, clearly a huge gap will remain that needs to be bridged before we can fully understand the evolutionary history of the rhinoceros family.

The specimen of the greater one-horned [Indian] rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros unicornis ) derives from cell culture held at the San Diego Zoo (ID = KB14498, SB137) and originally derives from a captive born female individual, that in turn was derived from captive born parents (Dam-100288 and Sire-100289). The specimen of black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis ) was provided by the Zululand Rhino Reserve, South Africa (ID = 46373), and is detailed further in the original paper reporting its genome ( Moodley et al., 2020 82.

Evol. 2020; 37 :3105-3117 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Sumatran rhinoceros ( Dicerorhinus sumatrensis ) sample derives from blood sampled from an individual named Kertam by a staff at the Sabah Wildlife Department in Borneo, Malaysia. Further details on this specimen are detailed in the original paper that released its genome ( Lord et al., 2020 71. Lord, E. ∙ Dussex, N. ∙ Kierczak, M. ...

The Javan rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros sondaicus ) genome derives from three sub-samples of dried soft tissue (two) and bone (one) taken from a skull collected in 1838 in Java, that is currently kept in the collections of the Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo (Natural History Museum, Oso; accession Museum id: 734). The woolly rhinoceros ( Coelodonta antiquitatis ) specimen (ID = ND036; a femur) was collected along the Rakvachan River (N69° 17,80’ E167° 38,53’), on the Kyttyk Peninsula, Chukotka, Russia. The sample has been radiocarbon dated twice, yielding radiocarbon age estimates of 46200 ± 2300 14 C years BP (OxA-36569) and 51980 ± 4900 14C years BP (MAG-2095). The Siberian unicorn ( Elasmotherium sibiricum ) genome was generated from a radius subsample of a specimen (IPAE 915/2804) that originated from Tobolsk, Russia (58°N 68°E) and has a radiocarbon age of > 49,200 14 C years BP (OxA-34900). The genome of the Merck’s rhinoceros ( Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis ) derives from a first molar (M1) tooth root that was subsampled from a complete cranium (National Alliance of Shidlovskiy “Ice Age,” Ice Age Museum, Moscow; accession F-4160) recovered from the Chondon River valley in Yakutia, Russia (N70° 12′ E137°) and dated to between 48,000 and 70,000 years BP ( Kirillova et al., 2017 58.

Briefly, in addition to the DNA extract obtained in Kirillova et al., a second DNA extraction was performed following the previously reported methods ( Dabney et al., 2013 24. Dabney, J. ∙ Knapp, M. ∙ Glocke, I. ... Complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a Middle Pleistocene cave bear reconstructed from ultrashort DNA fragments Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :15758-15763 Crossref Scopus (618) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the University of California Santa Cruz Paleogenomics laboratory. We constructed four libraries (single-indexed and double-stranded) for each DNA extract following the methods reported by Meyer and Kircher (2010 80. Meyer, M. ∙ Kircher, M. Illumina sequencing library preparation for highly multiplexed target capture and sequencing Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2010; 2010 pdb.prot5448 Crossref Scopus (1056) Google Scholar ). The total of eight indexed libraries were pooled and sent to SciLifeLab (Stockholm, Sweden) for sequencing on two lanes of the Illumina HiSeq-X platform (150 PE). In addition, a subsample was processed in the ancient DNA laboratories at the GLOBE Institute, University of Copenhagen, following the same protocols as described with the same library construction method for the Javan rhinoceros, and sequenced on three lanes of PE100 data on a BGISeq 500 platform at BGI Shenzhen.
A subsample was taken from a radius (IPAE 915/2804) of the Siberian unicorn and DNA was extracted at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (University of Adelaide) as previously reported by Kosintsev et al.

The library was split into 8 separate PCR reactions to minimize PCR bias and maintain library complexity. Each PCR of 25 μL contained 1 × HiFi buffer, 2.5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM dNTPs, 0.5 mM each primer (containing a unique combination of 7-mer i5 and i7 indexes), 0.1 U Platinum Taq Hi-Fi polymerase and 3 μL DNA. The cycling conditions were 94°C for 6 min; 7 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 40 s; followed by 68°C for 10 min. Following PCR, replicates were pooled and purified using 1.1x volume AxyPrep magnetic beads, eluted in 30 μL EB buffer, and quantified using a TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). The library was sequenced on three lanes of an Illumina HiSeq X Ten at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research (Sydney, Australia). 4 additional PCR reactions were conducted in Stockholm, Sweden. Each PCR of 25 μL contained 1x AccuPrime reaction mix, 0.3 μM IS4 amplification primer, 0.3 μM P7 indexing primer, 7 U AccuPrime Pfx (Thermo Scientific) polymerase. The cycling conditions were 95°C for 2 min, 14 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s and 68°C for 1 min. PCR replicates were pooled and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), eluted in 36 μL EB Buffer, and quantified using a high-sensitivity DNA chip on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The library was subsequently sequenced on one Illumina HiSeqX lane with a 2 × 151 bp setup in the High Output mode at SciLifeLab (Stockholm, Sweden).
For the historic/ancient rhinoceros samples, although multiple sequencing libraries were constructed and some were sequenced with different read length strategies, comparison tests of the different datasets found no bias differences (detailed in the Additional resources section) and thus we merged them for the subsequent analyses.
High molecular weight DNA was extracted from a cell culture specimen from the San Diego Zoo (ID = KB14498, SB137) for the greater one-horned rhinoceros using a Kingfisher duo prime extraction robot. Paired-end Truseq PCR-free libraries of insert size of 180bp and 670bp were constructed and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X platform at SciLifeLab (Stockholm, Sweden) generating approximately 400 million paired-end (2x150bp) each. Additionally, three mate-pair libraries (3, 5 and 20 kb) from two specimens, one from San Diego Zoo (KB17733) and one from Rotterdam Zoo (IR_104724), were constructed and sequenced for approximately 100 million paired-end reads (2x150bp) each on the Illumina HiSeq X at SciLifeLab (Stockholm, Sweden).
We merged the paired-end reads for all the ancient and historic rhino samples (Siberian unicorn, Javan, Merck’s and woolly rhinoceros) using a modified version of AdapterRemoval ( Schubert et al., 2016 104. Schubert, M. ∙ Lindgreen, S. ∙ Orlando, L. AdapterRemoval v2: rapid adapter trimming, identification, and read merging BMC Res. Notes. 2016; 9 :88 Crossref Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ) which masked the conflict bases that have identical sequencing qualities to Ns and removed collapsed reads < 30 bp. Then, we mapped the short reads from those rhinoceros species onto their corresponding genome references ( Table S2 ) and obtained their genomes (consensus sequences) using the doFasta module (-doFasta 2) in ANGSD (version 0.924) ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 60. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: analysis of next generation sequencing data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a minimum requirement of mapping quality and base quality of 20. A minimum depth of 5 was set for the Javan and woolly rhinoceros, and the minimum depth was set as 3 for the Siberian unicorn and Merck’s rhinoceros due to their relatively lower coverages (∼30× for the former pair, versus ∼10× for the latter pair).
For the greater one-horned rhinoceros, we obtained its genome using a mate-pair assembly. Since assembly quality can vary for different datasets, we used three different assemblers and evaluated their performance. The following assemblers for short read sequence data were used: ALLPATHS-LG v.52485 (HAPLOIDIFY = True) ( Gnerre et al., 2011 40. Gnerre, S. ∙ Maccallum, I. ∙ Przybylski, D. ... High-quality draft assemblies of mammalian genomes from massively parallel sequence data Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :1513-1518 Crossref Scopus (1119) PubMed Google Scholar ), ABySS v.2.0.2 (-k = 61) ( Simpson et al., 2009 107. Simpson, J.T. ∙ Wong, K. ∙ Jackman, S.D. ... ABySS: a parallel assembler for short read sequence data Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1117-1123 Crossref Scopus (2377) PubMed Google Scholar ) and SOAPdenovo2 v. 2.04 (-K 61) ( Luo et al., 2015 72. Luo, R. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Xie, Y. ... Erratum: SOAPdenovo2: an empirically improved memory-efficient short-read de novo assembler Gigascience. 2015; 4 :30 30 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Out of the three assemblers, ALLPATHS-LG was selected for downstream analyses as it produced the most gene-complete and the contiguous assembly (with a scaffold N50 of 27.7 Mbp. Gene completeness was measured with BUSCO v.5.0.0 ( Seppey et al., 2019 105. Seppey, M. ∙ Manni, M. ∙ Zdobnov, E.M. BUSCO: Assessing Genome Assembly and Annotation Completeness Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :227-245 Crossref Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the “mammalia_odb10” ortholog dataset, which showed a low degree of missing, fragmented and duplicated genes: “C:96.2% [S:95.6%, D:0.6%], F:1.0%, M:2.8%, n:9226.”
The genome annotation of white rhinoceros is its original release with its genome assembly. Since genome annotations of both the black and Sumatran rhinoceros were not released with their genome assemblies, we annotated the genomes of the black, Sumatran and greater one-horned rhinoceroses as follows. First, repeats were masked using RepeatMasker (Smit, AFA, Hubley, R & Green, P. RepeatMasker Open-4.0.2013-2015) with all (“model_org=all”) species being included in the RepBase. Then, we masked the transposable element proteins using RepeatRunner ( Smith et al., 2007 109. Smith, C.D. ∙ Edgar, R.C. ∙ Yandell, M.D. ... Improved repeat identification and masking in Dipterans Gene. 2007; 389 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the repeat protein library te_proteins.fasta (downloaded from http://weatherby.genetics.utah.edu/data/maker_tutorial.tgz ). After that, we applied Ensemble (version 64) ( Yates et al., 2020 137. Yates, A.D. ∙ Achuthan, P. ∙ Akanni, W. ... Ensembl 2020 Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :D682-D688 PubMed Google Scholar ) for homolog prediction with its amino acid datasets including Sus scrofa , Tursiops truncatus , Bos taurus, Drosophila melanogaster, Vicugna pacos and Homo sapiens . De novo gene prediction was achieved with: a) Augustus (version 3.2.3) ( Stanke et al., 2008 113. Stanke, M. ∙ Diekhans, M. ∙ Baertsch, R. ... Using native and syntenically mapped cDNA alignments to improve de novo gene finding Bioinformatics. 2008; 24 :637-644 Crossref Scopus (699) PubMed Google Scholar ), where “human” was used as the gene prediction species model for Augustus; b) and SNAP ( Korf, 2004 59. Korf, I. Gene finding in novel genomes BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5 :59 59 Crossref Scopus (1230) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the provided mammal model (mam54). Finally, Maker (version 2.31.10) ( Holt and Yandell, 2011 49. Holt, C. ∙ Yandell, M. MAKER2: an annotation pipeline and genome-database management tool for second-generation genome projects BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :491 Crossref Scopus (807) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to weigh and merge different evidence, and obtain protein-coding-gene sets for the black, Sumatran and greater one-horned rhinoceros.
The four de novo assembled rhinoceros genomes and the genome of tapir ( Tapirus terrestris , GCA_004025025.1) were aligned to the horse reference genome ( Equus caballus , GCF_000002305.2) using LAST with parameters of -m 100 -E 0.05 ( Kiełbasa et al., 2011 57. Kiełbasa, S.M. ∙ Wan, R. ∙ Sato, K. ... Adaptive seeds tame genomic sequence comparison Genome Res. 2011; 21 :487-493 Crossref Scopus (594) PubMed Google Scholar ), and each pairwise alignment was chained and netted to form high quality blocks. After that, the non-syntenic regions were filtered out from each alignment. Finally, the pairwise local alignments were combined to generate a final multi-species whole genome alignment (MWGA) using MULTIZ without reference fixed and with a radius of 50 in dynamic programming ( Blanchette et al., 2004 8. Blanchette, M. ∙ Kent, W.J. ∙ Riemer, C. ... Aligning multiple genomic sequences with the threaded blockset aligner Genome Res. 2004; 14 :708-715 Crossref Scopus (934) PubMed Google Scholar ).
After generating the MWGA for all the de novo assemblies, a sliding window-based phylogenetic analysis was conducted along the horse genome with a window size of 100 kb. A set of UCSC genome browser tools ( Kuhn et al., 2013 63. Kuhn, R.M. ∙ Haussler, D. ∙ Kent, W.J. The UCSC genome browser and associated tools Brief. Bioinform. 2013; 14 :144-161 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ), including mafsInRegion, mafFilter, maf2fasta, and several in-house PERL scripts were applied to divide the whole genome alignment into sub-regions. Then, for each sub-region, we included the genome sequences of the non- de novo sequenced rhinoceros samples, via extracting the corresponding sequences based on the region coordinate information on their reference genomes, and conducted multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 55. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (16422) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also removed the alignments with effective length < 1,000 bp and effective ratio < 0.5, of which the effective sites represent nucleotide sites that do not include missing information (Ns) for any taxa in the multiple sequence alignment. After that, the GTR+CAT model of RaxML ( Stamatakis, 2014 112. Stamatakis, A. RAxML version 8: a tool for phylogenetic analysis and post-analysis of large phylogenies Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1312-1313 Crossref Scopus (15517) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to build Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees for each window. Finally, the species tree was generated using the multi-species coalescent model-based software ASTRAL III ( Mirarab et al., 2014 81. Mirarab, S. ∙ Reaz, R. ∙ Bayzid, M.S. ... ASTRAL: genome-scale coalescent-based species tree estimation Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :i541-i548 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ), by combining all the regional trees.
Due to the poor quality of the endogenous DNA recovered from the historical and ancient samples, their genome sequences could only be reconstructed through mapping against a reference genome. To test whether the choice of reference genome would play any role in shaping either the consensus sequence recovered, or phylogenetic inference based on the data, we used the 100 PE reads generated from the woolly rhinoceros and the Siberian unicorn to examine reference bias via aligning their short reads onto different references including the horse ( Equus caballus ), white, greater one-horned, and Sumatran rhinoceros, respectively. Following genome alignment, 82 genome regions of length > 20,000 bp were selected to infer phylogenetic trees ( Figure S1 A). Those regions were randomly scattered across the genome, thus having little chance of being found in the same recombination blocks.
We calculated the frequency of three topologies around each focal internal branch of the species tree ( Figure 2 B) using DiscoVista ( Sayyari et al., 2018 103. Sayyari, E. ∙ Whitfield, J.B. ∙ Mirarab, S. DiscoVista: Interpretable visualizations of gene tree discordance Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2018; 122 :110-115 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) and NW_utils ( Junier and Zdobnov, 2010 50. Junier, T. ∙ Zdobnov, E.M. The Newick utilities: high-throughput phylogenetic tree processing in the UNIX shell Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :1669-1670 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ), for the 100 kb windows based gene trees. A multi-species coalescent simulation was also applied to determine the expected gene tree distributions on the basis of the dated species tree using the Phybase package following Wang et al. (2018) 125. Wang, K. ∙ Lenstra, J.A. ∙ Liu, L. ... Incomplete lineage sorting rather than hybridization explains the inconsistent phylogeny of the wisent Commun. Biol. 2018; 1 :169 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar . Then, we inspected the congruency between the frequency of the three topologies inferred from empirical genomic data and that generated from the simulation for the Rhinocerotinae lineage.
To validate the robustness of our species tree, we also reconstructed the phylogenetic relationship across each chromosome independently (reference by horse’s chromosomes) for all the rhinoceros species that have de novo genome assemblies and two outgroups of tapir and horse using the aforementioned 100 kb sliding windows based method. Then, for each chromosome we inferred a species tree and calculated the tree topology frequency using DiscoVista ( Sayyari et al., 2018 103. Sayyari, E. ∙ Whitfield, J.B. ∙ Mirarab, S. DiscoVista: Interpretable visualizations of gene tree discordance Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2018; 122 :110-115 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ).
As a genomic region with length of 100 kb may contain multiple recombination breakpoints, we sampled a short alignment with length of 5,000 bp within each 100 kb sliding window to infer gene trees using RaxML ( Stamatakis, 2014 112. Stamatakis, A. RAxML version 8: a tool for phylogenetic analysis and post-analysis of large phylogenies Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1312-1313 Crossref Scopus (15517) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a substitution model setting of GTR+CAT and 100 bootstrap replicates. Then we filtered out gene trees with nodes of bootstrap support < 85 to guarantee congruent signals throughout each subregion. Finally, the frequency of three topologies around the phylogenetic discordance branch obversed based on 100 kb sliding windows were calculated using DiscoVista ( Sayyari et al., 2018 103. Sayyari, E. ∙ Whitfield, J.B. ∙ Mirarab, S. DiscoVista: Interpretable visualizations of gene tree discordance Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2018; 122 :110-115 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Orthologs of the species with de novo genome assemblies were extracted from the former synteny checked MWGA: 1) gene location and the corresponding exon regions in the horse genome annotation file were used to extract CDSs from the MWGA alignment asking for a coverage ≥ 80%; 2) the amino acid sequences obtained from the horse genome serving as query were used to find corresponding homologs for each species using protein2genome model in EXONERATE ( Slater and Birney, 2005 108. Slater, G.S.C. ∙ Birney, E. Automated generation of heuristics for biological sequence comparison BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6 :31 Crossref Scopus (1271) PubMed Google Scholar ); 3) exons that were not shared by all species were removed to improve the gene alignment accuracy; 4) amino acid sequences were aligned using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 55. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (16422) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in turn used to guide the CDS alignment using PAL2NAL ( Suyama et al., 2006 115. Suyama, M. ∙ Torrents, D. ∙ Bork, P. PAL2NAL: robust conversion of protein sequence alignments into the corresponding codon alignments Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 :W609-12 Crossref Scopus (1467) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the samples without de novo assemblies, we obtained their orthologs according to the gene and exon location information from their reference genomes. In order to further diminish the potential influence of reference bias, we obtained two gene sequences for each ortholog by mapping their reads onto two different reference genomes ( Table S2 ), and merged the two gene sequences while masking conflicts as “N” (X for amino acids).
We inferred the evolutionary timescale of rhinoceros lineages using a set of 3,513 orthologs from the set identified in the previous section (8,820,642 nucleotides). The set of orthologs was selected to minimize the possible bias in molecular rates arising from analyses of finite number of sites or excessive discrepancies in molecular rates across lineages in particular loci ( Marshall et al., 2006 77. Marshall, D.C. ∙ Simon, C. ∙ Buckley, T.R. Accurate branch length estimation in partitioned Bayesian analyses requires accommodation of among-partition rate variation and attention to branch length priors Syst. Biol. 2006; 55 :993-1003 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). To select orthologs, we first performed a fast tree search for each ortholog, using only NNI tree rearrangements, under a GTR+R4 substitution model ( Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017 52. Kalyaanamoorthy, S. ∙ Minh, B.Q. ∙ Wong, T.K.F. ... ModelFinder: fast model selection for accurate phylogenetic estimates Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :587-589 Crossref Scopus (2961) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in IQ-TREE v1.6 ( Nguyen et al., 2015 85. Nguyen, L.T. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ von Haeseler, A. ... IQ-TREE: a fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating maximum-likelihood phylogenies Mol. Biol. Evol. 2015; 32 :268-274 Crossref Scopus (6381) PubMed Google Scholar ). Orthologs were considered as adequate for molecular dating analyses if they contained low degrees of rate variation among lineages ( Doyle et al., 2015 31. Doyle, V.P. ∙ Young, R.E. ∙ Naylor, G.J.P. ... Can we identify genes with Increased Phylogenetic Reliability Syst. Biol. 2015; 64 :824-837 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), and if their gene trees were not too greatly distinct from the species tree ( Mendes and Hahn 2016 79. Mendes, F.K. ∙ Hahn, M.W. Gene tree discordance causes apparent substitution rate variation Syst. Biol. 2016; 65 :711-721 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, the orthologs retained had gene trees with coefficients of variation in root-to-tip length (non-clocklikeness) < 0.1, and Robinson-Foulds distances to our inferred species tree ≤ 2.
Our analyses included time-calibrations on four splits of the species tree, each based on several lines of evidence from the fossil record. The nodes were calibrated using uniform distributions with soft maximum bounds, placing a 0.025 probability on older ages. Placement of maximum bound for a clade assumes that less inclusive clades cannot be older than the oldest fossils of more inclusive clades. (i) We calibrated the split between Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae as occurring between 35 Ma and 44 Ma. This minimum bound is supported by the earliest record of Rhinocerotinae, with Epiaceratherium naduongense , at between 35-39 Ma ( Böhme et al., 2013 9. Böhme, M. ∙ Aiglstorfer, M. ∙ Antoine, P. ... Na Duong (northern Vietnam) – an exceptional window into Eocene ecosystems from Southeast Asia Zitteliana. 2013; 53 :121-167 Google Scholar ), which is unambiguously a species nested within Rhinocerotinae. Additional evidence for this minimum bound is the earliest species assigned to Elasmotheriinae, Penetrigonas dakotensis , which appears at ca. 38 Ma ( Heissig, 2012 48. Heissig, K. The American genus Penetrigonias Tanner & Martin, 1976 (Mammalia: Rhinocerotidae) as a stem group elasmothere and ancestor of Menoceras Troxell, 1921 Zitteliana, 2012 Google Scholar ). Furthermore, morpho-anatomical cladistic analysis has placed the 38 My-old fossil Subhyracodon occidentali s as a representative of Elasmotheriinae ( Becker et al., 2013 7. Becker, D. ∙ Antoine, P. ∙ Maridet, O. A new genus of Rhinocerotidae (Mammalia, Perissodactyla) from the Oligocene of Europe J. Syst. Palaeontology. 2013; 11 :947-972 Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar ). The maximum bound is supported by fossil and phylogenetic evidence placing with high confidence the minimum age of Rhinocerotidae at 44 Ma ( Bai et al., 2020 6. Bai, B. ∙ Meng, J. ∙ Zhang, C. ... The origin of Rhinocerotoidea and phylogeny of Ceratomorpha (Mammalia, Perissodactyla) Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :509 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). (ii) The split between Rhinoceros and Dicerorhinus was calibrated as occurring between 13 Ma and 23 Ma. The minimum age is based on remains from the middle Siwaliks of Pakistan dating from ca. 13 Ma and unambiguously assigned to Dicerorhinus , under the name of D. aff. sumatrensis ( Heissig, 1972 47. Heissig, K. Paläontologische und geologische Untersuchungen im Tertiär von Pakistan. V. Rhinocerotidae (Mamm.) aus den unteren und mittleren Siwalik-Schichten Abh. Bayerischen Akad. Wiss. 1972; 152 :1-112 Google Scholar ). Other remains from the same region and age confirm the occurrence of Dicerorhinus as early as the middle Miocene (13.7-11.65 Ma; P.-O.A., unpublished data). The maximum bound is informed by the first attested occurrence of Rhinocerotina in the fossil record (one-horned rhinocerotine Gaindatherium cf. browni ; Bugti Hills, Pakistan: 22.6 Ma; Antoine et al., 2013 2. Antoine, P.-O. ∙ Métais, G. ∙ Orliac, M.J. ... Mammalian Neogene biostratigraphy of the Sulaiman Province, Pakistan Columbia University Press, Wang, X.-m. ∙ Flynn, L.J. ∙ Fortelius, M. (Editors) in: Fossil mammals of Asia: Neogene Biostratigraphy and Chronology. 2013; 400-422 Google Scholar ). (iii) The split between Rhinoceros unicornis and Rhinoceros sondaicus was calibrated as occurring between 1.9 Ma and 5.3 Ma. The minimum bound is supported by the earliest occurrence of both species in the fossil record ( Antoine et al., 2021 3. Antoine, P.-O. ∙ Reyes, M.C. ∙ Amano, N. ... A new clade of rhinoceroses from the Pleistocene of Asia sheds light on mainland mammal dispersals to the Philippines Zool. J. Linn. Soc. 2021; Published online May 22, 2021 Crossref Google Scholar ). A morphology-based phylogenetic analysis of Rhinocerotina, with a comprehensive sample within Rhinoceros , retrieves the following topology: ( R. sondaicus, ( R. sinensis ,( R. unicornis ,( R. kendengindicus , R. platyrhinus )))), with the first occurrence of Rhinoceros platyrhinus estimated at around the Pliocene–Pleistocene transition (2.58 Ma; Antoine et al., 2021 3. Antoine, P.-O. ∙ Reyes, M.C. ∙ Amano, N. ... A new clade of rhinoceroses from the Pleistocene of Asia sheds light on mainland mammal dispersals to the Philippines Zool. J. Linn. Soc. 2021; Published online May 22, 2021 Crossref Google Scholar ). The maximum age constraint coincides with the earliest estimated age of Rhinoceros from the same morphology-based phylogenetic analyses. (iv) The split between Ceratotherium simum and Diceros bicornis was calibrated to occur between 5.3 Ma and 7.3 Ma. This range is consistent with records of Diceros bicornis recognized in upper Miocene deposits (> 5.3 Ma) at Lothagam (Kenya, 6.54-5.2 Ma; Brown and McDougall, 2011 14. Brown, F.H. ∙ McDougall, I. Geochronology of the Turkana depression of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia Evol. Anthropol. 2011; 20 :217-227 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Albertine (Uganda, 7.25-5.3 Ma; Pickford et al., 1993 94. Pickford, M. ∙ Senut, B. ∙ Hadoto, D. Geology and palaeobiology of the Albertine Rift valley, Uganda-Zaire. Volume I: geology; Géologie et paléobiologie de la vallée du Rift albertin, Ouganda, Zaïre. Volume I: Géologie CIFEG Occasional Publications, 1993 Google Scholar ).
Molecular data tend to identify the timing of the early radiation of mammals as being older than fossil evidence (e.g., O’Leary et al., 2013 86. O’Leary, M.A. ∙ Bloch, J.I. ∙ Flynn, J.J. ... The placental mammal ancestor and the post-K-Pg radiation of placentals Science. 2013; 339 :662-667 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; dos Reis et al., 2014 30. dos Reis, M. ∙ Donoghue, P.C.J. ∙ Yang, Z. Neither phylogenomic nor palaeontological data support a Palaeogene origin of placental mammals Biol. Lett. 2014; 10 :20131003 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). For this reason, we performed analyses that included a fifth node-calibration on the age of the crown of all extant Perissodactyla. This calibration was a soft maximum bound at 66 Ma with a 0.01 prior probability of an older age. The age of this bound is based on the absence of unambiguous crown placental mammals before this time. All analyses were repeated after excluding this calibration for comparison ( Figure S5 A).
Additional molecular dating analyses were performed by including data from the tapir genome ( Figure S5 A), therefore including representatives of all living families of Perissodactyla (Equidae, Tapiridae, and Rhinocerotidae). The addition of these data was followed by filtering loci for biased rate estimates as described above, which led to a dataset of similar size (3,163 orthologs with 7,325,631 nucleotides). The species tree topology in these augmented analyses included the tapir as the sister to Rhinocerotidae, while the horse remained as the outgroup. We included a sixth calibration in addition to those described above, this time on the timing of the split between Rhinocerotidae and Tapiridae. The calibration had a hard minimum bound and soft maximum bound (0.025 prior probability on older ages), ranging between 54 Ma and 64 Ma. The minimum age is based on the earliest appearance of Tapiroidea in the fossil record shortly after the Paleocene-Eocene transition, around 54 Ma, with Vastanolophus holbrooki and Cambaylophus vastanensis in Asia ( Rose et al., 2014 101. Rose, K.D. ∙ Holbrook, L.T. ∙ Rana, R.S. ... Early Eocene fossils suggest that the mammalian order Perissodactyla originated in India Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5570 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 53.5 Ma with Heptodon in North America ( Vandenberghe et al., 2012 122. Vandenberghe, N. ∙ Hilgen, F.J. ∙ Speijer, R.P. The Paleogene period Elsevier Science, Gradstein, F.M. ∙ Ogg, J.G. ∙ Schmitz, M.D. ... (Editors) in: The Geologic Time Scale 2012. 2012; 855-921 Google Scholar ). The maximum age is based on the earliest record of Notoungulata at ∼65 Ma (Tiupampa, Bolivia; Muizon and Ladevèze, 2020 83. Muizon, C.d. ∙ Ladevèze, S. Cranial anatomy of Andinodelphys cochabambensis , a stem metatherian from the early Palaeocene of Bolivia Geodiversitas. 2020; 42 :597-739 Crossref Google Scholar ). The extinct South American orders Notoungulata and Litopterna form a clade, sister to Perissodactyla within Panperissodactyla ( Buckley, 2015 15. Buckley, M. Ancient collagen reveals evolutionary history of the endemic South American ‘ungulates’ Proc. Biol. Sci. 2015; 282 :20142671 20142671 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Welker et al., 2015 127. Welker, F. ∙ Collins, M.J. ∙ Thomas, J.A. ... Ancient proteins resolve the evolutionary history of Darwin’s South American ungulates Nature. 2015; 522 :81-84 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westbury et al., 2017 129. Westbury, M. ∙ Baleka, S. ∙ Barlow, A. ... A mitogenomic timetree for Darwin’s enigmatic South American mammal Macrauchenia patachonica Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15951 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), therefore suggesting a similar, or earlier, age for stem Perissodactyla.
Bayesian dating analyses were performed using a GTR+Γ substitution model and an uncorrelated -gamma relaxed clock model as implemented in MCMCtree, part of PAML v4.8 ( Yang 2007 135. Yang, Z. PAML 4: phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24 :1586-1591 Crossref Scopus (7094) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further addressed heterogeneity in molecular evolutionary processes by partitioning the molecular clock and substitution models into each of the three codon positions (three partition subsets). We improved the efficiency of the analysis using approximate Bayesian computation ( Thorne et al., 1998 118. Thorne, J.L. ∙ Kishino, H. ∙ Painter, I.S. Estimating the rate of evolution of the rate of molecular evolution Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15 :1647-1657 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The posterior distribution was estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. After a burn-in phase of 10 5 MCMC steps, samples were drawn every 10 3 MCMC steps over a total of 10 7 steps. We verified convergence to the stationary distribution by comparing parameter estimates from four independent runs. Effective sample sizes were verified to be above 200 for all estimated parameters.
The BWA-ALN algorithm ( Li and Durbin, 2009 68. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (21953) PubMed Google Scholar ) is commonly used to align such short reads generated in aDNA studies to reference genomes, owing to its stable performance for ultra-short length (typically shorter than 100 bp). However, simulation data showed read mapping success rate of the relatively longer reads (60 bp and 80 bp) dropped about three fold for high divergence reads (3% divergence level) using BWA-ALN ( Parks and Lambert, 2015 93. Parks, M. ∙ Lambert, D. Impacts of low coverage depths and post-mortem DNA damage on variant calling: a simulation study BMC Genomics. 2015; 16 :19 19 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore compared the performance of BWA-ALN against BWA-MEM ( Li, 2013 66. Li, H. Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA-MEM. arXiv Genomics. 2013; 1303 :3997 Google Scholar ), on the sequencing data obtained for the four historical/ancient samples ( Figure S5 B). For BWA-ALN, we disabled read seeding (-l 1024) to enhance error tolerance, while we marked shorter split hits as secondary alignments and removed them from the outputs for the BWA-MEM method.
To explore for potential gene flow between the different rhinoceros species, we computed D-statistics that assesses genetic affinities between taxa based on patterns of shared derived alleles ( Green et al., 2010 42. Green, R.E. ∙ Krause, J. ∙ Briggs, A.W. ... A draft sequence of the Neandertal genome Science. 2010; 328 :710-722 Crossref Scopus (2197) PubMed Google Scholar ). For a given tree of topology (((H1, H2), H3), O), where O represents an outgroup, under the null hypothesis of no gene flow, shared derived alleles between H1 and H3, or H2 and H3, can only derive from incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and are expected to be symmetric between the two pairs. Therefore, ancient gene flow is assumed between a pair in which imbalanced aggregation of shared derived alleles are detected. However, we should be aware of the limitations of D-statistics analysis between highly divergent lineages - certain assumptions could be violated in cases such as repeated or independent mutations ( Prüfer et al., 2012 97. Prüfer, K. ∙ Munch, K. ∙ Hellmann, I. ... The bonobo genome compared with the chimpanzee and human genomes Nature. 2012; 486 :527-531 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ) and differences in lineage specific mutation rates ( Zheng and Janke, 2018 141. Zheng, Y. ∙ Janke, A. Gene flow analysis method, the D-statistic, is robust in a wide parameter space BMC Bioinformatics. 2018; 19 :10 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We independently mapped all raw reads from each rhinoceros species and the horse to three different reference genomes (greater one-horned rhinoceros, white rhinoceros and Sumatran rhinoceros) and then calculated D-statistics using the doAbbababa function module in ANGSD ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 60. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: analysis of next generation sequencing data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar ) specifying the horse as the outgroup ancestral allele and the following filtering parameters: 1) use only sites where the reads of the outgroup all have the same base; 2) minimum base quality and mapping quality of 20; 3) use only the transversion sites, all individuals have a minimum depth of 3, and maximum depth of 70; 4) a block size of 5 Mb to estimate standard errors using jackknife procedure.
We further assessed whether less efficient mapping of the horse outgroup to the rhinoceros reference genomes may be driving some of our conflicting D-statistics results that differed based on the reference genome choice. We did this by calculating the pairwise distance of all rhinoceros species to the outgroup horse three times using all individuals mapped to the three different reference genomes. We calculated pairwise distances in 1 Mb sliding windows across all scaffolds > 1 Mb in size using a consensus base call approach (-doIBS 2) in ANGSD. We additionally applied the following filters; only include sites that have coverage in all individuals, a minimum base quality and mapping quality of 20, and only consider transversion differences.
We estimated genome-wide heterozygosity for all the rhinoceros species based on a Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), of which one diploid individual will generate three allelic states: homozygous ancestral allele state (AA), heterozygotic state (AB) and homozygous derived allele state (BB). Therefore, the whole genome level heterozygosity rate can be calculated as AB/(AA+AB+BB). We applied the doSaf function (-doSaf 1) module in ANGSD (version 0.924) ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 60. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: analysis of next generation sequencing data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar ) to calculate genome-wide heterozygosity for each rhinoceros species with parameters of: unique mapping, a minimum mapping quality of 20, a minimum base quality of 20, a minimum and maximum depth value of 1/3 and 2 times of the average genome depths, respectively, for each species. For the ancient and historic samples (Javan, Merck’s, woolly rhinoceros and Siberian unicorn), transition sites were removed (-noTrans 1) to eliminate the potential influences of DNA damage derived from cytosine deamination.
We applied the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) method ( Li and Durbin, 2011 69. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Inference of human population history from individual whole-genome sequences Nature. 2011; 475 :493-496 Crossref Scopus (1029) PubMed Google Scholar ) to infer the history of population size changes in the ancestors of all the eight rhino species. For the species for which genomes were de novo assembled, we aligned ∼30× genome coverage of the shotgun reads to recover the diploid genome heterozygosity information with depth filters of ≥ 1/3 and ≤ 2 × of the average depths. Then, PSMC was used to estimate the distribution of the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) between the two alleles across all chromosomes using the density information of heterozygous sites across each diploid genome. Changes in effective population size (N e ) were inferred assuming a substitution rate (μ) of 2.2 × 10 −8 substitutions/site/generation and a generation time (g) of 25 years for the African rhinoceroses ( Figure 3 A; Moodley et al., 2020 82. Moodley, Y. ∙ Westbury, M.V. ∙ Russo, I.M. ... Interspecific gene flow and the evolution of specialisation in black and white rhinoceros Mol. Biol. Evol. 2020; 37 :3105-3117 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a μ of 2.34 × 10 −8 and g of 12 years for the other rhinoceros species ( Figures 3 B and 3C; Dinerstein and McCracken, 1990 28. Dinerstein, E. ∙ McCracken, G.F. Endangered greater one-horned rhinoceros carry high levels of genetic variation Conserv. Biol. 1990; 4 :417-422 Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar ; Lord et al., 2020 71. Lord, E. ∙ Dussex, N. ∙ Kierczak, M. ...

Genomic analysis of demographic history and ecological niche modeling in the endangered Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :70-76.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). The consistency of the demographic results was tested by performing 100 bootstrap replicates as shown in Figure 4 . ROH segments were recorded by summarizing genome regions of which the TMRCA dated to a recent time period (best fit K value of ≤ 2) following the method in Palkopoulou et al. (2015) 91. Palkopoulou, E. ∙ Mallick, S. ∙ Skoglund, P. ... Complete genomes reveal signatures of demographic and genetic declines in the woolly mammoth Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :1395-1400 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar .
First, gene annotation files of the de novo sequenced genomes (white, black, Sumatran and greater one-horned rhinoceroses) were imported into SnpEFF ( Cingolani et al., 2012 23. Cingolani, P. ∙ Platts, A. ∙ Wang, L. ... A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3 Fly (Austin). 2012; 6 :80-92 Crossref Scopus (4309) PubMed Google Scholar ) to create a gene function database. Then, we obtained the heterozygous sites for each rhinoceros species using BCFTOOLS ( Li, 2011 65. Li, H. A statistical framework for SNP calling, mutation discovery, association mapping and population genetical parameter estimation from sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :2987-2993 Crossref Scopus (2372) PubMed Google Scholar ) requiring: minimum and maximum depth of 1/3 and 2x of the average depth; mapping and base quality ≥ 20; variance quality ≥ 30; read supporting number of minor allele account for ≥ 20% of the total depth. After that, functional classes of the variances were estimated using SnpEFF ( Cingolani et al., 2012 23. Cingolani, P. ∙ Platts, A. ∙ Wang, L. ... A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3 Fly (Austin). 2012; 6 :80-92 Crossref Scopus (4309) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default settings. We trimmed 10 bp from the 5′ and 3′ ends of each read for the Merck’s rhinoceros and Siberian unicorn to alleviate the impact of DNA damages, because both the samples showed abnormal transition/transversion ratios - as high as 5.367 without end trimming ( Figure S4 B). However, as the transition/transversion ratio of the Merck’s rhinoceros stayed abnormally high after trimming, which is consistent with previous reports of its DNA damage pattern (Figure S4 in Cappellini et al., 2019 17. Cappellini, E. ∙ Welker, F. ∙ Pandolfi, L. ... Early Pleistocene enamel proteome from Dmanisi resolves Stephanorhinus phylogeny Nature. 2019; 574 :103-107 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ), we excluded it from further comparisons
To compare the rate of missense and loss-of-function mutations in rhinoceros to that of other mammals we obtained published re-sequencing data for 402 mammalian genomes from 30 species and mapped these to the phylogenetically closest available reference genome for each species (detailed in Table S4 ) using BWA-MEM v0.7.17 ( Li, 2013 66. Li, H. Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA-MEM. arXiv Genomics. 2013; 1303 :3997 Google Scholar ). We then obtained and filtered variant calls for each individual using GATK HaplotypeCaller v3.8 following the “short variant discovery best-practices guidelines including “hard filtering” ( Auwera et al., 2013 5. Auwera, G.A.V.d. ∙ Carneiro, M.O. ∙ Hartl, C. ... From FastQ data to high-confidence variant calls: the Genome Analysis Toolkit best practices pipeline Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2013; 43 :11.10.11-11.10.33 Crossref Scopus (2512) Google Scholar ). Additionally, we only retained within-species bi-allelic sites, and removed all indels and sites found at a frequency that was either less than one third, or greater than three times, the genome-wide autosomal coverage ( Li, 2014 67. Li, H. Toward better understanding of artifacts in variant calling from high-coverage samples Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2843-2851 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To investigate the putative genetic background of unique rhinoceros biological adaptations, we explored frameshift mutations shared across the rhinoceros lineages. We inspected the frameshift mutations in the alignment results generated by the EXONERATE analysis mentioned above. First, all the frameshift mutations with their location information (Gene IDs and Exon IDs) were extracted out for rhinoceros species with de novo assemblies being available (black, white, Sumatran and greater one-horned rhinoceroses). Then, we filtered out the frameshift mutations that share the same locations and exist in all four rhinoceros species, and recorded their gene information for further examination.
Since four of the rhinoceros genomes were generated from historic and ancient samples, data could only be generated from them by short read re-sequencing. Furthermore, given they represent historical or ancient samples, they are expected to contain damaged DNA (principally cytosine deamination ( Pääbo, 1989 90. Pääbo, S. Ancient DNA: extraction, characterization, molecular cloning, and enzymatic amplification Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :1939-1943 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar )) manifested as elevated C > T/G > A transitions at the 5′ and 3′ ends of sequence reads ( Briggs et al., 2007 11. Briggs, A.W. ∙ Stenzel, U. ∙ Johnson, P.L.F. ... Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :14616-14621 Crossref Scopus (516) PubMed Google Scholar ; Brotherton et al., 2007 13. Brotherton, P. ∙ Endicott, P. ∙ Sánchez, J.J.M. ... Novel high-resolution characterization of ancient DNA reveals C > U-type base modification events as the sole cause of post mortem miscoding lesions Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :5717-5728 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested the viability of restricting a number of the analyses performed to only the transversions, including heterozygosity estimation, historical demographical inference, and ROH estimation ( Figures S3 and S4 ). Also, the influences of the other factors such as reference selection and sequencing depth were evaluated. For the ROH estimation, we applied the ROH inference method to the four rhinoceros species with de novo genome assemblies, using the datasets both with and without transitions. For the PSMC estimation, we mapped short reads representing various data volumes (different genome coverages, 11×, 17× and 35×) from the black rhinoceros onto the white rhinoceros genome to test whether it is possible to obtain accurate demographic history results using short read data from species that have a closely-related reference genome available.
Analyses related to genome assembly, assembly quality evaluation, short read alignment and evolutionary relationship inferences can be found in the Method details section.
The results of some additional tests could be useful in understanding the sequence dataset for the historic/ancient rhinoceros samples and the comparative genome analyses, and can be found at: https://github.com/liushanlin/rhinoceros-comparative-genome/blob/main/additional_resources.md
