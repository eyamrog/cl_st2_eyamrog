Title: Maternal Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Cesarean-Born Infants Rapidly Restores Normal Gut Microbial Development: A Proof-of-Concept Study


Abstract: Summary

Infants born by vaginal delivery are colonized with maternal fecal microbes. Cesarean section (CS) birth disturbs mother-to-neonate transmission. In this study (NCT03568734), we evaluated whether disturbed intestinal microbiota development could be restored in term CS-born infants by postnatal, orally delivered fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). We recruited 17 mothers, of whom seven were selected after careful screening. Their infants received a diluted fecal sample from their own mothers, taken 3 weeks prior to delivery. All seven infants had an uneventful clinical course during the 3-month follow-up and showed no adverse effects. The temporal development of the fecal microbiota composition of FMT-treated CS-born infants no longer resembled that of untreated CS-born infants but showed significant similarity to that of vaginally born infants. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the intestinal microbiota of CS-born infants can be restored postnatally by maternal FMT. However, this should only be done after careful clinical and microbiological screening.

Section: Introduction

Microbial colonization of the newborn is a pivotal process that affects later-life health ( Stiemsma and Michels, 2018 50. Stiemsma, L.T. ∙ Michels, K.B.

Stunted microbiota and opportunistic pathogen colonization in caesarean-section birth Nature. 2019; 574 :117-121 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). After cessation of breastfeeding, the fecal microbiota gradually becomes dominated by mainly anaerobic Clostridia ( Bäckhed et al., 2015 4. Bäckhed, F. ∙ Roswall, J. ∙ Peng, Y. ... Dynamics and stabilization of the human gut microbiome during the first year of life Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17 :852 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ). This general pattern is evident across populations and likely represents a biologically determined phenomenon integral to normal human development ( Korpela and de Vos, 2018 22. Korpela, K. ∙ de Vos, W.M. Early life colonization of the human gut: microbes matter everywhere Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2018; 44 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is thus very likely that the human system has adapted to receiving specific microbial signals during certain time windows for reciprocal immune and metabolic programming during early life ( Maynard et al., 2012 32. Maynard, C.L. ∙ Elson, C.O. ∙ Hatton, R.D. ...

Natural microbiota colonization and development can be disturbed by practices that prevent maternal transmission of bacteria or alter the microbiota in the infant. One of the strongest disrupting factors of the normal colonization process is birth by cesarean section (CS). This practice effectively eliminates the possibility of natural vertical transfer of gut bacteria from mother to infant at birth, resulting in a deviation of microbiota development, most notably in the first 6 months of life ( Bäckhed et al., 2015 4. Bäckhed, F. ∙ Roswall, J. ∙ Peng, Y. ...

Korpela, K. ∙ de Vos, W.M. Early life colonization of the human gut: microbes matter everywhere Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2018; 44 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ).
CS deliveries are increasing worldwide, affecting over 50% of infants in certain regions, and there is emerging evidence that that infants born by CS have different bacterial and other exposures that may subtly alter neonatal physiology ( Boerma et al., 2018 8. Boerma, T. ∙ Ronsmans, C. ∙ Melesse, D.Y. ... Global epidemiology of use of and disparities in caesarean sections Lancet. 2018; 392 :1341-1348 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (861) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sandall et al., 2018 45.

Short-term and long-term effects of caesarean section on the health of women and children Lancet. 2018; 392 :1349-1357 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (708) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several studies have shown that birth by CS is associated with short- and long-term effects, including increased risk of chronic immune diseases ( Sevelsted et al., 2015 47. Sevelsted, A. ∙ Stokholm, J. ∙ Bønnelykke, K. ... Cesarean section and chronic immune disorders Pediatrics. 2015; 135 :e92-e98 Crossref Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ; Keag et al., 2018 21. Keag, O.E. ∙ Norman, J.E. ∙ Stock, S.J. Long-term risks and benefits associated with cesarean delivery for mother, baby, and subsequent pregnancies: Systematic review and meta-analysis PLoS Med. 2018; 15 :e1002494 Crossref Scopus (516) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, controversies remain regarding the effects of CS delivery, and it should be noted that premature delivery, use of antibiotics, and other confounders may affect the reported associations. Some large studies, notably in Scandinavia, found that CS delivery is not associated with specific diseases, such as type 1 diabetes ( Samuelsson et al., 2015 44. Samuelsson, U. ∙ Lindell, N. ∙ Bladh, M. ... Caesarean section per se does not increase the risk of offspring developing type 1 diabetes: a Swedish population-based study Diabetologia. 2015; 58 :2517-2524 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Clausen et al., 2016 11. Clausen, T.D. ∙ Bergholt, T. ∙ Eriksson, F. ... Prelabor cesarean section and risk of childhood Type 1 diabetes: a Nationwide Register-based Cohort Study Epidemiology. 2016; 27 :547-555 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, a recent Danish study addressing over 2.5 million childbirths between 1982–2010 with an up to 40-year follow-up showed an increased risk in CS-born children compared with those born by vaginal delivery of four common, immune-mediated hospital-diagnosed childhood chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes ( Andersen et al., 2020 2. Andersen, V. ∙ Möller, S. ∙ Jensen, P.B. ... Caesarean delivery and risk of chronic inflammatory diseases (Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Coeliac Disease, and Diabetes Mellitus): A population based registry study of 2,699,479 births in Denmark during 1973-2016 Clin. Epidemiol. 2020; 12 :287-293 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, a recent large United Kingdom-based cohort study showed stunted microbiota development, an increased level of pathogens, and impaired mother-to-infant microbiota transfer in CS-born infants ( Shao et al., 2019 48. Shao, Y. ∙ Forster, S.C. ∙ Tsaliki, E. ... Stunted microbiota and opportunistic pathogen colonization in caesarean-section birth Nature. 2019; 574 :117-121 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). Apart from the effect on the individual, this pervasive lack of vertical bacterial transfer may have intergenerational effects; when inheritance of gut bacteria from mother to daughter is eliminated, is it possible that certain mutualistic bacteria, co-adapted with the host for millennia, are permanently lost ( Blaser, 2017 7. Blaser, M.J. The theory of disappearing microbiota and the epidemics of chronic diseases Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :461-463 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The accumulating evidence of the importance of the gut microbiota for overall child development is raising the need for early correction of the microbiota imbalances caused by CS delivery. Because the infant gut is normally colonized at birth by maternal gut microbes, the most natural inoculum to seed the microbiota of the CS-born infant is maternal fecal matter. In this study (registered at Clinical Trials as NCT03568734), we investigated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) ( Smits et al., 2013 49. Smits, L.P. ∙ Bouter, K.E. ∙ de Vos, W.M. ... Therapeutic potential of fecal microbiota transplantation Gastroenterology. 2013; 145 :946-953 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ) from a mother to her own infant is safe and effective for restoring the normal gut microbiota and its development in early life in CS-born infants.

Section: Results

In this study (registered at Clinical Trials as NCT03568734), a total of 17 pregnant mothers due to deliver by CS were enrolled for postnatal FMT of their infants. 7 mothers were selected following extensive screening in line with the European consensus recommendation for FMT ( Cammarota et al., 2017 9. Cammarota, G. ∙ Ianiro, G. ∙ Tilg, H. ..., European FMT Working Group European consensus conference on faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice Gut. 2017; 66 :569-580 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar ), with our modifications relevant for newborns, including group B Streptococcus (GBS) carrier status analysis ( STAR Methods ; Table S1 ). All mothers delivered at the gestational age of 37 weeks (±3 days) and breastfed exclusively for at least 2 months ( Table S2 ). The mother of infant M11 received oral cefalexin for mastitis for 7 days starting 32 days after delivery, the other mother-infant pairs did not receive antibiotics apart from a single intravenous dose of 1.5 g cefuroxime, given 30–60 min before incision to all women undergoing elective CS. After birth by CS, the 7 selected newborns, 5 girls and 2 boys, were subjected to FMT with a stool transplant of their own mother that was delivered in 5 mL of the first human milk feeding. The infants were followed at the maternity ward for 2 days, and their inflammatory markers were assessed ( Table 1 ). The mean birth weight of the FMT-treated infants was 3,240 ± 285 g, and the height was 49.9 ± 1.7 cm. All infants were healthy with a mean APGAR score of 9 ± 1. All infants received 3.5 mg of the transplant, except for one infant (M6), who was given 7 mg of the transplant. Anaerobic plating indicated that a single dose contained approximately 0.7–16 × 10 6 live bacterial cells ( Table 1 ).
Although all other neonates had C-reactive protein (CRP) of 10 mg/L or less ( Table 1 ) 48 h after birth, infant M6 presented a value of 67 mg/L. This infant did not have clinical symptoms related to infection, and during follow-up the next day, the CRP decreased to 39 mg/L, and the infant was discharged without commencement of antimicrobial treatment. Although clinically inconsequential, because of this increase in CRP, all subsequent infants received 3.5 mg of transplant, and no increased CRP was observed ( Table 1 ).
The clinical course of the infants was uneventful. No increase in temperature was observed during follow-up at the maternity ward. At the 4-week follow-up visit, the parents of three neonates (infants M4, M8, and M12) reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms. The four other parents reported no gastrointestinal symptoms. Overall, the parents did not report any other symptoms, illness, or need for doctor appointments that could be related to the treatment, indicating that FMT did not cause any adverse health effects by the age of 3 months. The weight of the treated infants at 3 months (5,702 ± 525 g) was in the range of normal development ( Table 1 ; Table S3 ).
Because the health and development of FMT-treated infants were normal, we focused on their fecal microbiota, which was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and comparison with that of their mothers ( Figure 1 ). For procedural and scientific reasons, we used a mother’s fresh fecal sample generated 3 weeks prior to delivery (samples coded Mother A) to prepare the transplant (samples coded Transplant) and compared these with the mothers’ samples donated a few days prior to delivery (samples coded Mother B) for microbiota composition. As expected for adults, the microbiotas in these mothers’ samples were highly similar but clearly distinct from that of the infants’ samples in an unsupervised principal-coordinates analysis (PCoA) visualization ( Figure 1 ). The microbiota in meconium samples was equally different from any of the fecal samples. Infant samples collected after day 2 were rather similar in composition ( Figure 1 ).
The microbiota in FMT-treated infants’ samples was found to be very different from the microbiota of the mothers who donated the transplant, indicating highly selective outgrowth upon transplantation ( Figure 2 ). The mothers’ microbiota had the characteristic adult composition, dominated by Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. The meconium samples were mostly dominated by Aeromonas spp., except for infants M12 and M17, who had a more diverse composition resembling fecal samples. Six of the seven infants showed uniform microbiota development with Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp. rapidly rising to dominance, whereas infant M17 had high abundances of Enterobacter/Escherichia , Streptococcus , and Veillonella . Remarkably, these were already present in the meconium of M17. In the 2-day fecal samples, the microbiota consisted nearly exclusively of Bacteroides spp. (M10 and M11) or approximately half Bacteroides spp. together with uncultured Acidaminococcaceae (M4), Butyricimonas and Enterococcus spp. (M6; this infant had an elevated CRP on that day), or Paludibacter (M8), or Enterobacter/Escherichia (M12). Infant M17 retained a diverse composition on day 2. The abundance of Bacteroides spp. declined with age in all infants, except for M17, in whom Bacteroides outgrowth was observed at 4 weeks. By the age of 7 days, bifidobacteria had emerged as the dominant group in all but two infants (M17 and M11), who were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae . Bifidobacterium remained abundant in all subsequent samples, with the exception of the 4-week samples of infants M6 and M17, in whom Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides were abundant.
To compare the samples from FMT-treated infants with representative data from untreated Finnish infants, we collected 82 additional samples from vaginally born and CS-born fully breastfed infants ( Table 2 ; Table S2 ) that were processed and analyzed for microbiota composition following the same methodology ( Figure 2 ). Our ethics permission did not allow us to take blood at 2 days and compare the CRP levels of the other Finnish infants, but no difference was observed between the groups for average birth weight, weight at 3 months, or weight gain in 3 months ( Table S3 ). Most FMT-treated CS-born infants received probiotics ( Table 2 ). These mainly included Lactobacillus reuteri , which is present in a commonly used brand of vitamin D supplement that, in a Finnish national program, is given to infants from 2 weeks onward. No effects of this intervention were observed in the microbiota of FMT-treated CS-born infants or in samples of Finnish control infants, who also received this probiotic (32 of the “3 weeks or later” samples; Table 2 ; Table S2 ).
The overall microbiota development in FMT-treated CS-born infants much more resembled that of vaginally delivered infants than that of non-treated CS-born infants. During the first few days of life, the microbiota of FMT-treated infants differed from that of vaginally delivered infants (p = 0.03, PERMANOVA), but from 7 days onward, FMT-treated infants were similar to vaginally delivered infants and distinct from non-treated CS-delivered ones ( Table 3 ).
To further detail microbiota development in transplant-treated infants, we tested for microbiota differences between vaginally born infants and CS-born treated and untreated infants. We adjusted the tests for probiotics use (all control infants were fully breastfed and did no receive antibiotics) and performed a sensitivity analysis by omitting urgent CS cases. When comparing the abundances of the major microbiota families ( Figure 3 A) and orders ( Figure 3 B), we observed that, compared with vaginally delivered infants, CS-born infants had consistently and significantly low abundances of Bacteroidales (mainly genus Bacteroides ) and Bifidobacteriales and an increased abundance of Lactobacillales, Clostridiales, and Enterobacterales. This was not the case in FMT-treated CS-born infants (excluding a potential effect of the used probiotic Lactobacillus ), and the most remarkable effect of FMT treatment was rapid normalization of Bacteroidales abundance. Indeed, the abundance of Bacteroidales was significantly lower in the CS group compared with the FMT group and the vaginally born group at 1 and 3 weeks (p ≤ 0.001). At 12 weeks, the abundance of Bacteroidales declined in the FMT group. FMT-treated infants had a non-significantly reduced abundance of bifidobacteria during the first 2 days of life, after which the levels of bifidobacteria were comparable with those in vaginally born infants. Clostridiacaea were significantly elevated in infants of the CS group compared with those in the vaginally born and FMT-treated groups, especially at 3 and 12 weeks (p < 0.01). In addition to the differences in the dominant taxa, there were further, mostly transient differences between the groups in the lower-abundance taxa ( Figure S1 ). FMT treatment changed the microbiota of CS-born infants in such a way that the temporal development of all relevant groups resembled that of vaginally delivered infants. Importantly, the combined relative abundance of the potential pathogens Enterococcus faecium , Enterococcus faecalis , Enterobacter cloacae , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Klebsiella oxytoca , Haemophilus influenza , Campylobacter jejuni , and Salmonella enterica were consistently elevated in the CS group, but not in the FMT-treated CS-born group ( Figure 3 B). The difference in pathogen abundance between the CS-born and the FMT-treated CS-born groups was significant at 1 week (p < 0.0001) and 12 weeks (p < 0.00001).
Microbial diversity, as measured by the inverse Simpson diversity index, counts of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and species count, tended to be lower in the CS group compared with the vaginally born and FMT-treated groups ( Figure 3 C). FMT treatment increased diversity, particularly the OTU count, by the age of 1 week. This was due to an increase in very-low-abundance OTUs, many of which mapped to the same taxonomic species; the number of abundant species was similar between the groups.
To generalize our observations that FMT treatment restored the microbiota of CS-born infants, we expanded our data with publicly available microbiota datasets obtained from cohorts in Sweden ( Bäckhed et al., 2015 4.

These included, in total, 163 vaginally born and 38 CS-born infants as well as 6 CS-born infants who were experimentally inoculated with maternal vaginal microbes ( Dominguez Bello et al., 2016 13.

We characterized the microbiota at class level (Proteobacteria summarized to phylum level for simplicity) because this appeared to be sufficiently robust against biases caused by technical variation, as reported previously ( Korpela and de Vos, 2018 22. Korpela, K. ∙ de Vos, W.M. Early life colonization of the human gut: microbes matter everywhere Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2018; 44 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). A PCoA plot of this mixed dataset revealed that the microbiota composition clustered clearly by birth mode ( Figure 4 ). Confirming and expanding the earlier observations, the microbiota from FMT-treated CS-born infants clustered with those from vaginally born infants from 2 days until 3 months. Notably, samples from infants treated by vaginal swab, as described previously ( Dominguez Bello et al., 2016 13. Dominguez-Bello, M.G. ∙ De Jesus-Laboy, K.M. ∙ Shen, N. ... Partial restoration of the microbiota of cesarean-born infants via vaginal microbial transfer Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :250-253 Crossref Scopus (698) PubMed Google Scholar ), clustered with untreated CS-born infants (2 days, 7 days, 4 weeks) or did not resemble any of the other samples (2–3 weeks). This result was very generic and not driven by the country where the samples were collected, probiotics use, breast or formula feeding, or the type of CS (urgent or elective) ( Figure S2 ).

Section: Discussion

In this proof-of-concept pilot study, we transferred fecal microbiota from mother to infant to correct the gut microbiota imbalance commonly observed in CS-delivered infants. Although follow-up monitoring is desired, the presented results are clearly promising. None of the 7 treated infants showed complications, and FMT restored microbiota development to resemble that of infants born by vaginal delivery. Importantly, maternal FMT corrected the persistent lack of Bacteroides spp. in CS-born infants and delayed Bifidobacterium development, a signature of CS-born infants (Bäckhed et al., 2017; Korpela and de Vos, 2018 22. Korpela, K. ∙ de Vos, W.M. Early life colonization of the human gut: microbes matter everywhere Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2018; 44 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar Shao et al., 2019 48. Shao, Y. ∙ Forster, S.C. ∙ Tsaliki, E. ... Stunted microbiota and opportunistic pathogen colonization in caesarean-section birth Nature. 2019; 574 :117-121 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent large-scale study of the microbiota of newborns confirmed disrupted transmission of Bacteroides strains in CS-born infants ( Shao et al., 2019 48. Shao, Y. ∙ Forster, S.C. ∙ Tsaliki, E. ... Stunted microbiota and opportunistic pathogen colonization in caesarean-section birth Nature. 2019; 574 :117-121 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of interest, it was also observed that, compared with vaginally delivered infants, CS-born infants showed increased levels of potential opportunistic pathogens, such as Enterococcus , Enterobacter , and Klebsiella spp. ( Shao et al., 2019 48. Shao, Y. ∙ Forster, S.C. ∙ Tsaliki, E. ... Stunted microbiota and opportunistic pathogen colonization in caesarean-section birth Nature. 2019; 574 :117-121 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed a similar pattern in CS-born infants that was mitigated by FMT ( Figure 3 B).
We carefully selected mothers for their suitability to serve as donors for their own infants using established and newly developed criteria, of which the carrier state of GBS was the most important counter-selective parameter. We refrained from using a healthy non-GBS carrying donor for CS-born infants of excluded mothers. However, such allotransplantation of fecal microbiota could be considered in specific cases when more evidence of the safety and potential health benefits of this novel approach has emerged.
We developed the FMT procedure by using human milk as a delivery system and inoculated the first milk that was offered to a CS-born infant. This is based on the concept that fecal-oral microbiota transfer is a normal way of vertical microbiota transmission ( Zoetendal et al., 2001 55. Zoetendal, E.G. ∙ Akkermans, A.D.L. ∙ Akkermans-van Vliet, W. ... The host genotype affects the bacterial community in the human gastrointestinal tract Microb. Ecol. Health Dis. 2001; 13 :129-134 Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar ; Sakwinska et al., 2017 43. Sakwinska, O. ∙ Foata, F. ∙ Berger, B. ... Does the maternal vaginal microbiota play a role in seeding the microbiota of neonatal gut and nose? Benef. Microbes. 2017; 8 :763-778 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, it capitalizes on recent studies indicating a role of breastfeeding in mother-to-infant microbiota transmission ( Pannaraj et al., 2017 39. Pannaraj, P.S. ∙ Li, F. ∙ Cerini, C. ... Association between breast milk bacterial communities and establishment and development of the infant gut microbiome JAMA Pediatr. 2017; 171 :647-654 Crossref Scopus (701) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the presence in mother’s milk of a significant number of culturable cells or their DNA that derive from species found in the human gut ( Schwab et al., 2019 46. Schwab, C. ∙ Voney, E. ∙ Ramirez Garcia, A. ... Characterization of the cultivable microbiota in fresh and stored mature human breast milk Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10 :2666 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Asnicar et al., 2018 3. Asnicar, F. ∙ Manara, S. ∙ Zolfo, M. ... Studying vertical microbiome transmission from mothers to infants by strain-level metagenomic profiling mSystems. 2018; 2 :e00164-16 Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar ). Finally, for simplicity reasons, we used a single transfer with diluted fecal microbiota corresponding to 3.5 or 7 mg of the transplant (10 6 –10 7 viable cells). Whether the higher dose was associated with the temporally elevated CRP values of infant M6 cannot be ascertained, but this pilot study shows that the lower dose is effective and did not cause deleterious effects in the treated infants. The transplant used was found to contain, on average, 7 × 10 6 viable bacterial cells ( Table 1 ), with numbers and variations that are in line with what can be expected of diluted adult fecal microbiota ( Ben-Amor et al., 2005 5. Ben-Amor, K. ∙ Heilig, H. ∙ Smidt, H. ... Genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene analysis Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71 :4679-4689 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been well established that most women experience some degree of bowel movement during labor ( Fraser and Cooper, 2009 17. Fraser, D.M. ∙ Cooper, M.A. Myle’s Textbook for Midwives Elsevier Health Science Publishers, London, 2009 Google Scholar ). This would provide a potential route of seeding that may be more manifest when hygiene measures are not as strict as presently in the Western world. It is noteworthy to mention that a day of fasting or anal lavage preceding vaginal birth is practiced in some countries. It would be of interest to determine whether this also affects mother-to-baby microbiota transfer in vaginally delivered infants.
In this proof-of-principle study, we chose to take a fresh fecal sample when the mother was at ease during a scheduled study visit 3 weeks prior to delivery to rapidly process the transplant and enable pathogen screening in the actual transplant. During screening, we found that 29% (5 of 17) screened positive for pathogenic microbes, four for GBS, and one for herpes. In addition, a single case of suspected hepatitis was found ( Table S1 ). Hence, our findings warn against unsupervised, parent-driven maternal microbiota transfer (vaginal or fecal) to neonates because the probability of transmitting harmful microbes appears to be high. In contrast, future work should address the appropriate dose that simulates natural exposure to maternal feces at birth.
We did not find significant differences in microbiota composition between the transplant sample and the fecal sample of the mother taken within 3 days before delivery (Mother B) ( Figure 1 ). However, we clearly demonstrated that the infant gut is a highly selective environment because the microbial composition of the single maternal transplant changed dramatically after 2 days and beyond ( Figure 1 ). The temporal development of the newborn infant microbiota has been attributed to choreographed colonization by bacterial populations with the view that the human body is continuously sampling the pool of available colonists ( Costello et al., 2012 12. Costello, E.K. ∙ Stagaman, K. ∙ Dethlefsen, L. ... The application of ecological theory toward an understanding of the human microbiome Science. 2012; 336 :1255-1262 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar ; Milani et al., 2016). However, here we show that the temporal development in FMT-treated CS-born infants is a consequence of selective outgrowth of a fecal maternal inoculum. It has to be determined whether, in vaginally born infants, normal seeding is also a single large inoculation as applied here or the result of multiple and consecutive transfer events of the maternal microbiota. There are indications that maternal gut microbes gradually colonize CS-born infants in a delayed manner over the first several months of life, suggesting that bacterial transfer between family members occurs postnatally as well ( Korpela et al., 2018a 25. Korpela, K. ∙ Costea, P. ∙ Coelho, L.P. ... Selective maternal seeding and environment shape the human gut microbiome Genome Res. 2018; 28 :561-568 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). When the maternal inoculum has been transferred, the factors driving selective pressure may include fucosylated and other human milk oligosaccharides of the mother’s milk as well as other factors still to be discovered ( Milani et al., 2017 33. Milani, C. ∙ Duranti, S. ∙ Bottacini, F. ... The First Microbial Colonizers of the Human Gut: Composition, Activities, and Health Implications of the Infant Gut Microbiota Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2017; 81 :e00036 e1 Crossref Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ; Korpela et al., 2018a 25. Korpela, K. ∙ Costea, P. ∙ Coelho, L.P. ... Selective maternal seeding and environment shape the human gut microbiome Genome Res. 2018; 28 :561-568 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some of these factors may show temporal developments because, in a recent mouse model, it has been shown that the seeding moment of the transplant determines the resulting community ( Martínez et al., 2018 31. Martínez, I. ∙ Maldonado-Gomez, M.X. ∙ Gomes-Neto, J.C. ... Experimental evaluation of the importance of colonization history in early-life gut microbiota assembly eLife. 2018; 7 :e36521 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). This may also contribute to the variations observed in temporal development of early-life microbiota ( Costello et al., 2012 12. Costello, E.K. ∙ Stagaman, K. ∙ Dethlefsen, L. ... The application of ecological theory toward an understanding of the human microbiome Science. 2012; 336 :1255-1262 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar ; Milani et al., 2016).
Until now, there has been no safe and effective means of full microbiota restoration in CS-delivered infants. Vaginal microbiota transfer has been suggested as a means to naturalize the CS-born infant’s gut microbiota ( Dominguez-Bello et al., 2016 13. Dominguez-Bello, M.G. ∙ De Jesus-Laboy, K.M. ∙ Shen, N. ... Partial restoration of the microbiota of cesarean-born infants via vaginal microbial transfer Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :250-253 Crossref Scopus (698) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, here we show that vaginal swabbing does not correct the CS-induced microbiota imbalance. This is not surprising because vaginal bacteria do not normally colonize the infant gut ( Sakwinska et al., 2017 43. Sakwinska, O. ∙ Foata, F. ∙ Berger, B. ... Does the maternal vaginal microbiota play a role in seeding the microbiota of neonatal gut and nose? Benef. Microbes. 2017; 8 :763-778 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ferretti et al., 2018 15. Ferretti, P. ∙ Pasolli, E. ∙ Tett, A. ... Mother-to-Infant microbial transmission from different body sites shapes the developing infant gut microbiome Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :133-145.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some formulations marketed as probiotics contain bifidobacteria that may partly normalize the overall microbiota ( Korpela et al., 2018c 27. Korpela, K. ∙ Salonen, A. ∙ Vepsäläinen, O. ... Probiotic supplementation restores normal microbiota composition and function in antibiotic-treated and in caesarean-born infants Microbiome. 2018; 6 :182 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the most dramatic difference between vaginally and CS-delivered infants is the ubiquitous lack of Bacteroides spp. in the latter group ( Bäckhed et al., 2015 4. Bäckhed, F. ∙ Roswall, J. ∙ Peng, Y. ... Dynamics and stabilization of the human gut microbiome during the first year of life Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17 :852 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ; Korpela and de Vos, 2018 22. Korpela, K. ∙ de Vos, W.M. Early life colonization of the human gut: microbes matter everywhere Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2018; 44 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). This cannot be restored by administering bifidobacteria or by a vaginal swab. Moreover, although there are no live strains of Bacteroides spp. marketed as probiotics, these might not even fully substitute the specific maternal strains the infant would receive naturally. Therefore, the most natural and cost-effective way to inoculate the term infant gut is to expose the infant to maternal intestinal bacteria, as we show in this proof-of-concept study.
Pediatric immune system-related diseases as well as obesity and metabolic diseases are increasing in prevalence globally and are a significant public health burden. Although causality remains to be demonstrated, many such chronic diseases have been associated with CS birth and are likely at least partly due to the abnormal microbiota signals to which the infant is exposed ( Stiemsma and Michels, 2018 50. Stiemsma, L.T. ∙ Michels, K.B. The role of the microbiome in the developmental origins of health and disease Pediatrics. 2018; 141 :e20172437 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gut bacteria are in constant interaction with the host, signaling to the host and influencing metabolic and immunological functions. Microbial signals are considered especially important during early development, when the immune system is taking shape. Indeed, mouse experiments indicate that the gut microbiota may influence epigenetic programming ( Pan et al., 2018 38. Pan, W.H. ∙ Sommer, F. ∙ Falk-Paulsen, M. ... Exposure to the gut microbiota drives distinct methylome and transcriptome changes in intestinal epithelial cells during postnatal development Genome Med. 2018; 10 :27 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), guide development of the immune system ( Gensollen et al., 2016 18. Gensollen, T. ∙ Iyer, S.S. ∙ Kasper, D.L. ... How colonization by microbiota in early life shapes the immune system Science. 2016; 352 :539-544 Crossref Scopus (1322) PubMed Google Scholar ), and affect growth and energy metabolism ( Blanton et al., 2016 6. Blanton, L.V. ∙ Charbonneau, M.R. ∙ Salih, T. ... Gut bacteria that prevent growth impairments transmitted by microbiota from malnourished children Science. 2016; 351 :aad3311 Crossref Scopus (529) PubMed Google Scholar ). Successful restoration of normal vertical microbiota transfer and subsequent age-associated microbiota development in CS-born infants may thus have widespread consequences for the long-term health of these infants.

Recruitment of the mothers-to-be took place after the antenatal visit at 33-34 gestational weeks at the Helsinki University Hospital for the assessment of the method of delivery in the period of October 27, 2017 till June 31, 2018. This was supervised by the Helsinki University Hospital and approved by the by the ethical committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS/2338/2016). The mothers had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Gestational age was calculated from the first day of the mother’s last menstrual period and confirmed by ultrasound examination of the fetus during the first trimester according to the national practice.
Potential participants (total of 50) planning CS delivery were initially informed about the study by the personnel at the maternity outpatient clinic of the Women’s Hospital (Helsinki University Hospital) and written information was given to all. Interested participants were contacted by the study nurse and informed about the study practicalities in more detail. Those who decided to join the study (total of 17) were visited by the study nurse at home to be consulted further about the study and to answer any questions. Moreover, the possibility to talk with the study physician was given, either through a phone call or by appointment. A written consent was collected during the visit of the study nurse if the mothers fulfilled the eligibility criteria, incuding a healthy pregnancy and willingness to be subject of elaborate screening of themselves and analysis of their infant. Maternal exclusion criteria included positive GBS status, maternal antibiotic treatment within 3 months of delivery, any travel outside the EU within the last 3 months, multiple pregnancy and cesarean section after the onset of labor. In addition, the mothers were subject to intensive screening for pathogens as detailed below, in line with the European consensus recommendation for FMT ( Cammarota et al., 2017 9. Cammarota, G. ∙ Ianiro, G. ∙ Tilg, H. ..., European FMT Working Group European consensus conference on faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice Gut. 2017; 66 :569-580 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following the pathogen screening and further clinical inspection before the due date, it appeared that 10 of the 17 mothers were ineligible since 4 were positive for GBS, 1 had initially inconclusive results for hepatitis E antigen, 1 had a clinically assessed herpes infection, while 2 infants were born in an emergency operation, 1 infant presented with transient tachypnea of the newborn and in one pregnancy the screening had not been carried out before delivery. Therefore, seven pregnant mothers were selected for the FMT procedure with an average age of 34.9 years (see Table 1 and Table S1 ).
Prior to the transplantation, all seven mothers (and fathers when available) were met by one of the clinicians (OH or SA) to discuss the practical aspects and potential risks associated with the study, and answer any questions related to the study. In the CS procedure as practiced at the Helsinki Hospital (both for elective and urgent CS delivery) all mothers receive a single intravenous dose of 1.5 g cefuroxime, given 30 to 60 minutes prior to incision.
Two observational cohorts were used for delivering control samples that were collected at the same time points as in the FMT-treated infants: HELMi ( Korpela et al., 2019 28. Korpela, K. ∙ Dikareva, E. ∙ Hanski, E. ... Cohort profile: Finnish Health and Early Life Microbiota (HELMi) longitudinal birth cohort BMJ open. 2019; 9 :e028500 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Jorvi ( Korpela et al., 2020 29. Korpela, K. ∙ Salonen, A. ∙ Saxen, H. ... Antibiotics in early life associate with specific gut microbiota signatures in a prospective longitudinal infant cohort Pediatr. Res. 2020; 88 :438-443 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Participants for the HELMi cohort were recruited from antenatal clinics in Helsinki, Finland (indicated Hel in Table S2 ). The Jorvi cohort was recruited at the maternity ward of the Jorvi hospital in Espoo, Finland (indicated L in Table S2 ). All families provided informed consent. Samples from healthy, term-born, normal-weight breastfed infants that were never exposed to antibiotics, excluding CS-associated antibiotics, were selected to be used as control samples. All samples were processed and analyzed in the same laboratory and the same personnel using the same protocol.
At 3 weeks before the planned CS delivery, a fresh fecal sample was collected and a blood sample of 5 mL was taken from the recruited mothers. The blood samples were screened for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus, human T cell lymphotrophic virus, Treponema pallidum , hepatitis A, B, C and E. Their fecal samples were analyzed for the presence of protozoa and helminths, Entamoeba histolytica , Clostridium difficile , enteric pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Vibrio cholerae, pathogenic Escherichia coli strains EHEC, ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, EAEC), Helicobacter pylori , norovirus, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). This screening was performed using standard serological tests for Helicobacter pylori, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium spp. while all other pathogens were detected using nucleic acid-based PCR or RT-PCR assays at the Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB, Helsinki, Finland). Except for EAEC, EIEC, EPEC and ETEC, culture-based methods were used for further typing in cases of any positive findings. The presence of MRSA, MDR bacteria and VRE were tested by culturing on specific plates but none of the samples tested positive. In addition, the presence of group B streptococci (GBS) in perinanal and cervical swabs was assayed by PCR in the first five mothers (infants M1-M5) and by culture in all consecutive mothers.
The fresh fecal sample of each mother taken 3 weeks before the planned C-section was further processed within 5 hours of donation by dissolving 100 mg in 15 mL of isotonic saline containing 10% glycerol (pharmaceutical grade), and frozen at −80°C until delivery (Transplant). Viable counts of this preparation were determined by plating on Fastidious Anaerobic Agar and colonies were scored after 7 days of anaerobic incubation at 37°C. An aliquot of 100 mg was also immediately frozen at −80°C and used for DNA isolation (Mother A sample). Another fecal sample of the mothers was taken 1-3 days prior to delivery and used for DNA isolation (Mother B sample).
For the FMT procedure, the Transplant sample was thawed in the morning of the elective CS, and 1.0 mL was mixed with mother’s own milk obtained before the CS and if needed pasteurized bank milk to a total volume of 10 ml. A sample (10 mL for infant M2 and 5 mL for all other infants) was administered in the first feeding of the infant within 2 h of birth. Mixing own milk and bank milk for the first feeding of the newborn is common practice in the Helsinki birth clinics and is applied to neonates if the maternal milk supply is not sufficient, most typically after elective CS.
The infants were followed after delivery according to the normal clinical routine including determination of the APGAR score. In addition, temperature measurements took place every 6 hours and complete blood counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined at 2 days of age, and the meconium and fecal sample at 2 days of age were preserved in the hospital ward first by freezing at −20°C and subsequently stored at −80°C in the research lab. After discharge, fecal samples were gathered weekly at home for the first 4 weeks and again at 3 months of age. These samples were immediately frozen at −20 C in the home freezer and transferred in frozen form in containers to the research laboratory where they were stored at −80 C until use for DNA extraction. A follow-up visit took place at 4 weeks of age, during which a pediatrician performed a clinical examination of the infant, documented the use of vitamin D supplementation and any probiotics, and received the collected fecal samples. At three months of age the families met with the study nurse, who collected the 3-month fecal sample and documented information on weight and height gain, further probiotic use, and vaccinations according to the routine follow-up schedule at the well-baby-clinic. All infants were breast-fed for three months, except for infant M17 who started formula feeding at the age of 2 months. Except for one infant (M6) all infants received probiotics from the age of 2-4 weeks (predominantly Lactobacillus reuteri ) but in all cases after the 2-week fecal sample had been donated or later. All infants received vitamin D from the age of two weeks as recommended by the Finnish National Welfare Institute. Rotavirus vaccine was administered to all but for infant M8 at 2 and 3 months of age. Infant M6 was presented with inguinal hernia, which was surgically operated at 76 days of age. Comparative microbiota analyses (see below) were performed with fecal samples, collected and processed as described above, from non-treated CS- and vaginally delivered infants (see Table S2 ). The probiotic use of these infants had been recorded and included the use of Lactobacillus reuteri (see Table 2 ). The control infants or their lactating mothers did not use any antibiotics during the follow-up period.
DNA was extracted from the fecal samples, 16S rRNA amplicons were generated and subjected to Illumina MiSeq sequencing as previously described ( Korpela et al., 2018b 26. Korpela, K. ∙ Salonen, A. ∙ Hickman, B. ... Fucosylated oligosaccharides in mother’s milk alleviate the effects of caesarean birth on infant gut microbiota Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :13757 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, fecal DNA was extracted by repeated bead beating and processed for sequencing using primers 341F 5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′ and 785R 5’-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′ ( Korpela et al., 2018b 26. Korpela, K. ∙ Salonen, A. ∙ Hickman, B. ... Fucosylated oligosaccharides in mother’s milk alleviate the effects of caesarean birth on infant gut microbiota Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :13757 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). The V3-V4 amplicons were equipped with Illumina TruSeq dual index primers (PE-121-1003) and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq using 2 × 300 bp reads and a MiSeq v3 reagent kit (MS-102-3003) with 5% PhiX as spike-in (Illumina). The DNA sequences were processed and analyzed using the R-package mare ( Korpela et al., 2016 23. Korpela, K. ∙ Salonen, A. ∙ Virta, L.J. ... Intestinal microbiome is related to lifetime antibiotic use in Finnish pre-school children Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10410 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ), which uses usearch for read processing, and taxonomic annotation ( Edgar, 2010 14. Edgar, R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2460-2461 Crossref Scopus (15878) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA extractions and MiSeq runs were processed in a time frame of 12 months and included internal reference samples and a mock community ( Ramiro-Garcia et al., 2016 42. Ramiro-Garcia, J. ∙ Hermes, G.D.A. ∙ Giatsis, C. ... NG-Tax, a highly accurate and validated pipeline for analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons from complex biomes F1000Res. 2016; 5 :1791 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The latter samples showed highly similar results (R2 < 3%, p > 0.5 for run ID in PERMANOVA; Pearson correlation coefficient above 87%). The Silva database was used for taxonomic annotation ( Quast et al., 2013 41. Quast, C. ∙ Pruesse, E. ∙ Yilmaz, P. ... The SILVA ribosomal RNA gene database project: improved data processing and web-based tools Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D590-D596 Crossref Scopus (19331) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data analysis was done without rarefaction or transformations, instead the number of reads was used as an offset in all statistical models ( Korpela et al., 2018b 26. Korpela, K. ∙ Salonen, A. ∙ Hickman, B. ... Fucosylated oligosaccharides in mother’s milk alleviate the effects of caesarean birth on infant gut microbiota Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :13757 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Statistical analysis was done using the R package mare ( Korpela et al., 2016 23. Korpela, K. ∙ Salonen, A. ∙ Virta, L.J. ... Intestinal microbiome is related to lifetime antibiotic use in Finnish pre-school children Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10410 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCoA was conducted using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity as the distance measure and calculated with the capscale function of R the package vegan and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities with function vegdist of the same package ( Oksanen et al., 2016 36. Oksanen, J. ∙ Blanchet, F.G. ∙ Friendly, M. ... vegan: Community Ecology Package. R package version 2.4-0 R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2016 Google Scholar ). Comparison of the relative abundance of bacterial genera between the groups at each time point was performed using the GroupTest function of the mare package. This function selects the most optimal model for each taxon, depending on its distribution, using either the glm.nb function from the MASS package ( Venables & Ripley 2002 52. Venables, W.N. ∙ Ripley, B.D. Modern Applied Statistics with S Springer, 2002 Crossref Google Scholar ) or the gls function from the nlme package ( Pinheiro et al., 2016 40. Pinheiro, J. ∙ Bates, D. ∙ DebRoy, S. ..., R Core Team nlme: Linear and Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models. R package version 3.1-128 R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2016 Google Scholar ). The GroupTest function tests whether the model is approapriate for each taxon separately and if not, attempts to find a suitable model. If no model is found, where the data meet the model assumptions, no p value is reported. The read counts for each taxon and sample were modeled as a function of delivery group, using the total read count per sample as the offset in the model. In the statistical testing, the vaginally born group was used as the reference group, and we tested for significance of the microbiota differences between the vaginally born reference group and the FMT-treated and non-treated CS-born groups at ages 1, 3, and 12 weeks. The tests were adjusted for probiotic use. Standard Benjamini-Hochberg corrections for FDR were applied as included in the R-package mare ( Korpela et al., 2016 23. Korpela, K. ∙ Salonen, A. ∙ Virta, L.J. ... Intestinal microbiome is related to lifetime antibiotic use in Finnish pre-school children Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10410 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ). FDR-corrected p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Further statistical details can be found in the Figure legends and in the results section.

Summary of Information about the Infant Samples Used in This Study, Related to Figure 4 The information on birth mode, vaginal or cesarean section (Csection) (planned or urgent indicated as Pl and Ur), time point (in months) as well as the use of probiotics (indicated as P) and breast milk is provided. For the FMT-CS infants the suffix also indicates the sample time point: meconium is indicated as Mec; days, weeks and months indicated as d, w and m, respectively (3 months represents 3-4 months samples). The relative abundances of Bifidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Clostridia, Bacteroidia and Bacilli are indicated. The FMT-treated cesarean section-born infants are indicated by Csection+FMT with the appropriate running M number (see Figure 1 ). The control samples collected in the period 2016-2018 from Finnish infants in the same hospital as where the FMT interventions were performed are also indicated (infants indicated by L and Hel). Finally, the control samples obtained from public data sets are shown and include averaged data for large global cohorts (indicated as average with N indicating the number of infants) as well as single infants from public datasets.
