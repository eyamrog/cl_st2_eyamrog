Title: The Immunoglobulin Superfamily Receptome Defines Cancer-Relevant Networks Associated with Clinical Outcome


Abstract: Summary

Cell surface receptors and their interactions play a central role in physiological and pathological signaling. Despite its clinical relevance, the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) remains uncharacterized and underrepresented in databases. Here, we present a systematic extracellular protein map, the IgSF interactome. Using a high-throughput technology to interrogate most single transmembrane receptors for binding to 445 IgSF proteins, we identify over 500 interactions, 82% previously undocumented, and confirm more than 60 receptor-ligand pairs using orthogonal assays. Our study reveals a map of cell-type-specific interactions and the landscape of dysregulated receptor-ligand crosstalk in cancer, including selective loss of function for tumor-associated mutations. Furthermore, investigation of the IgSF interactome in a large cohort of cancer patients identifies interacting protein signatures associated with clinical outcome. The IgSF interactome represents an important resource to fuel biological discoveries and a framework for understanding the functional organization of the surfaceome during homeostasis and disease, ultimately informing therapeutic development.

Section: Introduction

The plasma membrane constitutes a critical biological interface between the cytosol and the extracellular environment of the cell. Cell surface receptors are therefore quintessential regulators of cellular communication and interaction with the extracellular milieu, control signaling cascades during homeostasis, and are largely responsible for dysregulation during disease ( Overington et al., 2006 30. Overington, J.P. ∙ Al-Lazikani, B. ∙ Hopkins, A.L. How many drug targets are there? Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5 :993-996 Crossref Scopus (2947) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protein families that dictate these processes have expanded greatly during evolution, and recent studies predict that over 3,000 genes in the human genome encode for membrane-expressed proteins ( Thul et al., 2017 45. Thul, P.J. ∙ Åkesson, L. ∙ Wiking, M. ... A subcellular map of the human proteome Science. 2017; 356 :eaal3321 Crossref Scopus (1770) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vogel and Chothia, 2006 48. Vogel, C. ∙ Chothia, C. Protein family expansions and biological complexity PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2 :e48 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). By virtue of these essential functions and accessible location, families of cell-surface receptors represent prime targets for development of protein-based therapeutics ( Hopkins and Groom, 2002 18.

Notwithstanding these significant efforts, interactions that take place at the cell surface remain remarkably underrepresented in the aggregate of large-scale datasets ( Bausch-Fluck et al., 2018 5.

Our fragmentary understanding of the extracellular interactome can be partially attributed to the difficulties associated with the study of membrane proteins and limited compatibility with most high-throughput proteomics technologies ( Martinez-Martin, 2017 24.

Signal initiation in biological systems: the properties and detection of transient extracellular protein interactions Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5 :1405-1412 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To address these challenges and comprehensively study the extracellular protein networks in humans, we recently developed a technology for high-throughput detection of receptor-ligand interactions within a near complete library of human single transmembrane (STM) proteins ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 26. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ...

In this study, we utilize our discovery platform to elucidate the extracellular interaction network for the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), the most represented domain in human proteins ( Özkan et al., 2013 31. Özkan, E. ∙ Carrillo, R.A. ∙ Eastman, C.L. ... An extracellular interactome of immunoglobulin and LRR proteins reveals receptor-ligand networks Cell. 2013; 154 :228-239 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yap et al., 2014 52. Yap, E.H. ∙ Rosche, T. ∙ Almo, S. ... Functional clustering of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins with protein-protein interaction information calibrated hidden Markov model sequence profiles J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426 :945-961 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ) and largest family of secreted and cell surface-expressed proteins. IgSF members mediate a wide array of functionalities and represent a major focus for drug development efforts. Nevertheless, although select IgSF proteins have been studied in great detail, the majority remain uncharacterized in terms of binding partners and biological activity. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic experimental evaluation of the ensemble of interactions between human IgSF members, let alone between IgSF and a comprehensive set of STM receptors.
To systematically study this interaction ensemble, we screened 445 IgSF proteins against the STM library, resulting in a network of 577 high confidence protein-protein interactions (PPI) that revealed more than 400 interactions previously undocumented in either BioPlex ( https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu ; Huttlin et al., 2017 21. Huttlin, E.L. ∙ Bruckner, R.J. ∙ Paulo, J.A. ... Architecture of the human interactome defines protein communities and disease networks Nature. 2017; 545 :505-509 Crossref Scopus (987) PubMed Google Scholar ), Biogrid ( Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2017 10. Chatr-Aryamontri, A. ∙ Oughtred, R. ∙ Boucher, L. ... The BioGRID interaction database: 2017 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D369-D379 Crossref Scopus (730) PubMed Google Scholar ), or STRING ( Szklarczyk et al., 2015 44. Szklarczyk, D. ∙ Franceschini, A. ∙ Wyder, S. ... STRING v10: protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D447-D452 Crossref Scopus (7752) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using complementary biophysical methods, cell-based assays, and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we confirmed more than 60 receptor-ligand pairs, including interactors for prominent immune receptors, such as PD-L1/CD274 and PD-L2/PDCD1LG2. Integration of the IgSF interactome with human tissue expression profiles suggested functional associations between families, placing multitude of proteins with unknown or poorly defined functions in a biological context, including orphan receptors. In the same vein, overlay with differential mRNA and protein expression profiles in tumors enabled identification of interacting communities synergistically dysregulated, highlighting perturbations that may play a prominent role in cancer. Finally, evaluation of the IgSF Interactome in a cohort of cancer patients treated with the anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody atezolizumab revealed interacting protein communities associated with CD8 + T-effector (T eff ) cell function and uncovered protein interaction signatures highly correlated with lack of response to treatment and survival.
In sum, this study presents an experimental map of human extracellular protein interactions, spanning a significant fraction of the IgSF and STM receptors encoded by the human genome. Our results reveal hundreds of previously unknown interactions, including binding partners for prominent immune receptors and orphan proteins, suggesting functional associations between protein families and providing valuable insights into dysregulation of receptor-ligand pairs in tumors. Combined with clinical data, our work identifies interacting protein signatures significantly associated with clinical outcome, which uncover potential determinants of response and resistance to treatment. Collectively, this study represents an important resource to identify therapeutically relevant targets, and provides insights into individual receptor functions as well as global human receptome organization.

Section: Results

Striving toward the goal of elucidating the human extracellular interactome, we sought to determine the network of interactions between the IgSF and STM receptors in the human genome. First, a comprehensive list of STM receptors, including the IgSF, was compiled. A collection 445 human proteins, covering 365 proteins with at least one IgSF domain (≈73% of the superfamily) was complemented with selected functionally relevant extracellular proteins to constitute the set of “query” proteins to be screened against a library of >1,100 unique STM proteins, referred to as “preys” ( Figures 1 A and S1 A; Table S1 ). To enable robust detection of receptor interactions at large scale, we recently implemented a cell surface interaction screen to interrogate this collection of STM proteins in high-throughput ( Bushell et al., 2008 8. Bushell, K.M. ∙ Söllner, C. ∙ Schuster-Boeckler, B. ... Large-scale screening for novel low-affinity extracellular protein interactions Genome Res. 2008; 18 :622-630 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 26. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 B; STAR Methods ). We have previously demonstrated the power of this technology to detect receptor-ligand interactions characterized by a wide range of affinities, including transient interactions with micromolar K D ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 26. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further benchmark the sensitivity and robustness of this platform, PD-1/PDCD1 and PD-L2/PDCD1LG2 proteins were screened following the procedure described ( Figure 1 B). All expected interactors were detected with high normalized signal (>0.75), high binding specificity, and reproducibility (Pearson’s r ≥0.87) ( Figures 1 C and S1 B–S1D).
The systematic exploration of the interaction repertoire between IgSF members and STM receptors entailed screening over 2,000 individual 384-well plates to test ∼600,000 binary binding events ( Figure S2 A). To enable analysis of this dataset and reliably identify non-specific (false-positives) binders in an automated manner we developed a custom computational classification tool. To allow comparisons between thousands of screenings results, the enzymatic absorbance values were normalized and used to compute query and prey Z scores. Additionally, a custom specificity score was computed for each interacting pair ( Figures 2 B and S2 B; STAR Methods ). To predict high-confidence interactions, a supervised classification algorithm using the four above described metrics was trained on a benchmark dataset ( Figures S2 C–S2E; Table S2 ). This resulted in 577 predicted high-confidence interactions between 440 unique IgSF and STM proteins, referred to as the “IgSF interactome” ( Figure 2 A; Table S2 ; Data S1 ). To facilitate data integration, analysis, and visualization, the IgSF interactome was represented as a cytoscape interaction network where “nodes” represent extracellular proteins and “edges” the interactions between them ( Figure 2 A). A network analysis showed that the IgSF interactome network is highly connected with on average of 2–3 neighbors per node and with topological coefficients following a power-law distribution ( Figure 2 C), a hallmark of scale-free networks ( Barabási, 2009 4. Barabási, A.L. Scale-free networks: a decade and beyond Science. 2009; 325 :412-413 Crossref Scopus (1522) PubMed Google Scholar ), altogether suggesting that the network consists of modular components with dense intra-connectivity and sparse but relevant interconnectivity ( Albert, 2005 1. Albert, R. Scale-free networks in cell biology J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118 :4947-4957 Crossref Scopus (914) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Remarkably, the IgSF interactome recapitulated 105 known protein pairs and identified 472 interactions that were previously undocumented in the aggregate of Biogrid, BioPlex, and STRING databases ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). The largest overlap was found with the STRING database (82/1,037) and the smallest overlap with the combined BioPlex in HEK293 and HCT116 cells (11/350), an important observation given the scale and coverage of the BioPlex effort ( Figure S1 A). Integration of protein localization information (from the Human Protein Atlas) revealed that the number of interactions between two extracellular proteins is disproportionally low (∼1%) in BioPlex ( Figure 2 E), further highlighting the relevance of the present study to address interactions that take place in the extracellular environment. Finally, given that all IgSF query proteins are also included as STM library proteins, we investigated the percentage of reciprocal binding events for 316 heterophilic interactions in our screen. Indeed, 114 interactions (∼36%) were observed both as query-prey and prey-query pair ( Figure 2 F; Table S2), whereas 202 (∼64%) were not reproduced reciprocally. These included well-known protein pairs such as CTLA4, which as a query failed to bind the CD80 and CD86 library proteins, despite their demonstrated activity upon the CD28 query protein, suggesting that the format in which protein pairs are studied can influence their binding properties and result in potential false-negatives when not tested reciprocally.
The inherent challenges associated with the study of plasma membrane proteins have importantly hindered a systematic exploration of functional relationships between human receptors. To facilitate a functional interpretation of the IgSF Interactome, healthy tissue mRNA expression profiles for all genes in the network were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) project ( Pierson et al., 2015 35. Pierson, E. ∙ Koller, D. ∙ Battle, A. ..., GTEx Consortium Sharing and Specificity of Co-expression Networks across 35 Human Tissues PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004220 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 A). In agreement with the hypothesis that network modules with tight functional relationships are more likely to be co-expressed, we observed that the global tissue correlation coefficients for pairs of interacting proteins were significantly higher, compared to those of non-interacting pairs (p < 1.2 e −20 , one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test) ( Figure 3 B). Given the clear agreement between physical and co-expression evidence, GTEX expression correlation coefficients were used to inform clustering of the IgSF Interactome into modular components or “communities” ( Figures 3 A and S3 B; Table S3 ). The clustered Interactome displayed a number of tightly connected communities between closely related IgSF members, such as the nectin receptors ( Figure 3 , cluster 13) or the semaphorin/plexin family ( Figure 3 , cluster 21), among others. Next, each community was interrogated with a custom Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to attempt its functional classification. This enrichment analysis showed that all sizeable communities (n > 2) captured known IgSF biological processes and enabled assignment of putative functions to poorly characterized extracellular proteins, by association ( Figure 3 A; Table S3 ).
Although significant, the modest increase (+0.2) in average expression correlation of the interacting pairs suggested that this observation was driven by selected interactions and/or interactions in a specific tissue context. Indeed, within the top 5%, the expression of many known binding partners was prominently correlated in select tissues ( Figures 3 C, 3D, and S3 C). Interestingly, many of the protein pairs newly identified in the IgSF Interactome dataset also displayed similarly strong tissue-dependent associations ( Figures 3 D–3F and S3 D–S3F). We next asked whether some of these interactions could take place on cells, using a tetramerization-based approach for high sensitivity detection of putative binders ( Figure 3 H). These assays, in combination with co-immunoprecipitation studies ( Figures 3 L–3N), confirmed putative protein pairs predicted in our interactome ( Figures 3 K and S3 G–S3I).
The functional interaction map revealed that certain receptors showed distinct binding specificity and differential tissue expression within a protein family, suggesting unappreciated regulation within otherwise related families. Two notable examples were the ephrin receptor EPHA3, and the cell surface protein CEACAM4, identified as binding partners for PD-L1 and PD-L2, respectively ( Figure 4 A), which showed divergent expression patterns relative to related family members ( Figures S4 A–S4C). Importantly, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies confirmed binding of EPHA3 to PD-L1 ( Figure 4 B) and CEACAM4 to PD-L2 ( Figure 4 C) with moderate binding affinities (PD-L1/EPHA3: K D : 2.8 × 10 −8 M ± 2.7; PD-L2/CEACAM4, K D : 8.4 × 10 −8 M ± 69) ( Figures S4 D and S4E). SPR analysis also confirmed the newly identified interaction between the LILR family member LILRA3 and EPHA3 ( Figure 4 D). To further prove binding specificity, these interactions were assayed using cells expressing the relevant binding partners, as described in Figure 3 H. PD-L1 specifically interacted with its known binding partners PD-1 and PD-L2 as well as EPHA3 expressed on cells ( Figure 4 E), whereas PD-L2 bound to PD-L1, PD-1 and the new interactor CEACAM4, and not EPHA3 or other related proteins ( Figure 4 F). Interestingly, the therapeutic antibody atezolizumab, known to block the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and thus currently used as immunotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors ( Shah et al., 2018 41. Shah, N.J. ∙ Kelly, W.J. ∙ Liu, S.V. ... Product review on the Anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab Hum. Vaccin. Immunother. 2018; 14 :269-276 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), also competed the interaction with EPHA3 ( Figure 4 G).
We then studied the LILR immunoreceptor family, focusing on LILRB1, LILRB3, LILRB4, and LILRB5, characterized by the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) ( Brown et al., 2004 7. Brown, D. ∙ Trowsdale, J. ∙ Allen, R. The LILR family: modulators of innate and adaptive immune pathways in health and disease Tissue Antigens. 2004; 64 :215-225 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; van der Touw et al., 2017 46. van der Touw, W. ∙ Chen, H.M. ∙ Pan, P.Y. ... LILRB receptor-mediated regulation of myeloid cell maturation and function Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2017; 66 :1079-1087 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). These assays corroborated specific interactions for the LILR family ( Figure 4 H), results that were further confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation studies ( Figures 4 I–4K), further demonstrating that these interactions can take place in the plasma membrane.
Next, we focused on the community centered around the PTPR family, the largest family of plasma membrane-expressed receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases ( Du and Grandis, 2015 16. Du, Y. ∙ Grandis, J.R. Receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases in cancer Chin. J. Cancer. 2015; 34 :61-69 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). This community revealed a tightly knit module between members of the PTPR family and four different families of nervous system-related proteins ( Figures 3 , cluster 1, and 5 A). In addition, the netrin-G ligand-3 (NGL-3/LRRC4B), known to interact with PTPRs proteins, was found to bind specific members of the butyrophilin family ( Arnett and Viney, 2014 2. Arnett, H.A. ∙ Viney, J.L. Immune modulation by butyrophilins Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :559-569 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). To confirm and further study the complex connections between these protein families, PTPRD, PTPRS, and PTPRF were expressed as cell surface proteins and tested for binding to their putative partners ( Figure 3 H). These results confirmed the specific interaction between the SLITRK3 and PTPRD and PTPRS ( Figure 5 B), as well as LFRN5 ( Figure 5 C) and IL1RAP ( Figure 5 D), to PTPRD, PTPRS, and PTPRF but no other family members ( Figures S5 B–S5E). In line with these results, SPR analysis further confirmed PTPRD binding to SLITRK1, SLITRK4, LFRN1, LFRN4, IL1RAP, and IL1RAPL1 proteins ( Figure 5 E). In addition, we confirmed binding of cell surface expressed LRRC4B to specific butyrophilin proteins ( Figures 5 F, 5G, S5 A, S5F, and S5G) and corroborated these interactions by co-immunoprecipitation studies ( Figures 5 H–5J).
The increasing number of population-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has greatly enhanced our perception of disease-specific mutations, however, their mechanistic or functional consequences are often poorly understood. To investigate whether genetic alterations in the PTPRD protein with high prevalence in tumors ( Peyser et al., 2015 33. Peyser, N.D. ∙ Du, Y. ∙ Li, H. ... Loss-of-Function PTPRD Mutations Lead to Increased STAT3 Activation and Sensitivity to STAT3 Inhibition in Head and Neck Cancer PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0135750 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Veeriah et al., 2009 47. Veeriah, S. ∙ Brennan, C. ∙ Meng, S. ... The tyrosine phosphatase PTPRD is a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated and mutated in glioblastoma and other human cancers Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :9435-9440 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ) lead to perturbations in its interaction network, we examined a collection of 14 mutants representing all domains in the ectodomain ( Figure 5 K; Table S4 ; STAR Methods ). Interestingly, in addition to alterations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase domain, frequently occurring mutations were located throughout the immunoglobulin (IG) and fibronectin (FN) ectodomains, suggesting indeed an impact on the landscape of extracellular PTPRD interactions. Overall, we found that mutations in the FN domains did not substantially modify the PTPRD interaction repertoire, whereas alterations in the IG domain had a more significant effect ( Figure 5 L), in agreement with published reports and existing structures ( Mohebiany et al., 2013 27. Mohebiany, A.N. ∙ Nikolaienko, R.M. ∙ Bouyain, S. ... Receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase ligands: looking for the needle in the haystack FEBS J. 2013; 280 :388-400 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Veeriah et al., 2009 47. Veeriah, S. ∙ Brennan, C. ∙ Meng, S. ... The tyrosine phosphatase PTPRD is a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated and mutated in glioblastoma and other human cancers Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :9435-9440 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, binding to ILRAP family members was not or only marginally impaired, with the exception of mutants in the IG1 and IG2 domains ( Figure 5 L). Nearly all studied mutations impacted the weaker interactor LRRC4B, suggesting that these interactions are generally perturbed in the tumor. Unexpectedly, these results also revealed that specific mutations selectively impact binding to specific family members ( Figure 5 L; Table S4 ). This perturbed interaction network for prevalent cancer-associated PTPRD mutations may play a role in disease pathology and suggests a broader scope of biological functions and signaling properties that had remained uncharacterized for PTPRD.
A list of all the receptor-ligand interactions identified in this study and validated using orthogonal methods is provided in Table 1 . Some of the protein pairs tested could not be validated with the techniques utilized. Several reasons could account for this, including poor quality of the recombinant proteins, inactivation of the query protein upon biotinylation, or lack of expression in the selected cell lines.
Despite significant insights on dysregulated gene expression in tumors by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program ( http://www.cbioportal.org/ ), our understanding of how gene expression alterations impact signaling pathways in cancer remains significantly limited, in part due to the poor coverage of receptor-ligand interactions. In an attempt to connect genomic information and functional significance, differential mRNA expression data between tumor and adjacent normal tissue, as reported in TCGA, was incorporated into the IgSF interactome ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). Interestingly, we observed that over 90% of the IgSF genes studied were significantly differentially expressed (two-sided t test, |log 2 fold-change| > 1, q < 0.05) in at least one tumor indication ( Figure 6 A; Table S5 ). In fact, a systematic randomized comparison between pairs of unrelated genes, reported in TCGA, and pairs found to interact in our dataset, showed that counts of the latter were consistently higher across all TCGA indications ( Figure 6 B). Notably, this integration effort highlighted interacting proteins that were jointly downregulated in nearly all tumors, such as members of the PTPR family, consistently with a tumor suppressor function ( Bae et al., 2017 3. Bae, H. ∙ Kim, B. ∙ Lee, H. ... Epigenetically regulated Fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein 2 (FLRT2) shows tumor suppressor activity in breast cancer cells Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :272 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chang et al., 2010 9. Chang, G. ∙ Xu, S. ∙ Dhir, R. ... Hypoexpression and epigenetic regulation of candidate tumor suppressor gene CADM-2 in human prostate cancer Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16 :5390-5401 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, this analysis also confirmed that well-characterized interacting pairs are commonly upregulated in multiple shared TCGA indications, including immune receptor pairs such as CTLA4/CD80 or PD-1/PD-L1 ( Figures 6 C and 6D). In addition, as illustrated by certain members of the LILR family, a number of interacting proteins were found to be differentially expressed in opposing directions across multiple tumor indications ( Figures S6 B and S6C; Table S5 ), suggesting that disruption of these interactions may influence cell communication in the tumor in a yet to be understood manner.
Next, we sought to investigate which interactions had strongly correlated protein expression levels in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), a recently published resource of 375 cancer cell lines ( Nusinow et al., 2020 28. Nusinow, D.P. ∙ Szpyt, J. ∙ Ghandi, M. ... Quantitative Proteomics of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Cell. 2020; 180 :387-402 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (507) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to the observations made using GTEX, the Pearson correlations for the subset of interacting pairs was significantly higher compared to the non-interacting pairs albeit less outspoken (one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum text, p < 0.05) ( Figure 6 E) and with overall lower correlation scores. Nevertheless, the integration with relative protein expression profiles in the CCLE also revealed many interactions that were significantly correlated ( Figures 6 F–6M, S3 H, S3I, and S6 F), such as the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL and its novel binder VSIG10L ( Figure 6 N; Zhu et al., 2019 54.

Cancer. 2019; 18 :153 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the lack of protein expression measurements for the second putative interactor identified, IL1RL1, we were also able to confirm the interaction between AXL and IL1RL1 using multiple orthogonal methods, and validate that it was not shared with the highly related MERTK and TYRO3 receptors ( Figures 6 O–6Q). Finally, tightly negatively correlated interactions were also observed ( Figures S6 I and S6J), suggesting an important suppressive role for these interactions ( Chung et al., 2019 12. Chung, M. ∙ Teigen, L.E. ∙ Libro, S. ...

Notwithstanding the measurable success of immune checkpoint therapies to reinvigorate pre-existing anti-tumoral responses, only a fraction of patients response to treatment, suggesting that unknown non-redundant pathways can influence tumorigenesis ( Sharma et al., 2017; Chen and Mellman, 2017 11.

Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3421) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify new receptor-ligand networks associated with resistance and response to therapy, the IgSF Interactome was studied in the context of a large phase 2 trial (IMvigor210) that included transcriptome profiles for a cohort of 298 metastatic urothelial cancer patients treated with the PD-L1 blocking antibody Atezolizumab ( Mariathasan et al., 2018 23. Mariathasan, S. ∙ Turley, S.J. ∙ Nickles, D. ... TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (3242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, subsets of IgSF Interactome proteins exhibited strong correlations with either immune cold (or non-inflamed), hot (inflamed) tumors, or immune excluded phenotypes, defined by a CD8 + T eff cell signature and a pan-fibroblast transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signature, respectively ( Figures 7 A and S7 A: Mariathasan et al., 2018 23. Mariathasan, S. ∙ Turley, S.J. ∙ Nickles, D. ... TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (3242) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Supported by the observation that PD-L1 expression correlates with the T eff cell signature, and a better response to therapy, our analysis highlighted known interacting proteins with a clear association to hot tumors including PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA4/CD80, CD28/CD86, or CD47/SIRPA, as well as newly identified proteins pairs such as PD-L1/EPHA3, PD-L2/CEACAM4, LILRB4/CNTFR, LILRB1/EDAR, and LILRB1/IL6R ( Figures 7 A and S7 A; Table S6 ). Conversely, cell adhesion families including the semaphorin and the plexin receptors or UNC and FLRT proteins, alongside newly identified interactors such as UNC5D/GPC3, were prominently associated with immune cold tumors ( Figures 7 A and S7 A; Table S6 ).
We then sought to explore the association between the interacting IgSF/STM pairs identified in this study and observed clinical outcomes, beyond T eff cell function. Patients were categorized in responders and non-responders to atezolizumab, as previously described ( Mariathasan et al., 2018 23. Mariathasan, S. ∙ Turley, S.J. ∙ Nickles, D. ... TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (3242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Approximately 80 protein interactions (∼15% of the interactome network) were indeed significantly associated with either an improved or worsened clinical outcome for this cohort ( Figure 7 B; Table S6 ). As expected, interactions within the CD80 and PD-1 families of immunoreceptors were strongly correlated with response to atezolizumab. In addition, new protein pairs such as interactions between LRRC4B and specific butyrophylin members were strongly correlated with response ( Figures 7 B, S7 B and S7C, and S7E and S7F; Table S6 ). Conversely, interactions within the semaphorin/plexin family, as well as specific PTPRD regulators, were significantly associated with poor response to treatment ( Figure 7 B).
Next, we investigated whether interacting gene pairs showed a synergistic effect on the predicted clinical outcome by comparing the product of their individual gene expression hazard ratio to the “protein interaction” hazard ratio (HR), derived from their joint expression. Notably, 137 protein pairs, representing ∼25% of the IgSF Interactome network, showed a significantly exaggerated HR ( Figure 7 C; Table S6 ). Among those associated with a lack of response to treatment, we observed new interactions for proteins with well characterized roles in tumors, such as FLT1, EDAR, or CD47, as well as the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases or members of the LILR family. A prominent example of a synergistic interaction was ephrinB1 (EFNB1) ( Figure S7 D; Table S2 ), which showed a significantly higher association with non-responders when its interaction partners ECV2, AQPEP, and EPHB6 were also expressed relative to their gene expression in isolation ( Figure 7 D). Strikingly, the observed co-expression of EFNB1/ECV2 was significantly associated with poor prognosis ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Conversely, validated protein pairs, such as LRRC4B and the butyrophilins, showed an enhanced response prediction, albeit toward a favorable outcome ( Figures S7 C and S7F; Table S6 )

Section: Discussion

Understanding plasma membrane interactomes is central for defining the molecular processes that drive cell functions, elucidating basic aspects of receptor functions, and identifying pathways amenable to therapeutic intervention. Here, we provide an experimental, integrated interaction map of the IgSF and STM proteins in the human genome. Comparison of the IgSF Interactome dataset with BioPlex, Biogrid, and STRING showed close to 500 newly reported IgSF-STM binary binding partners, while many reported interactions between IgSF proteins in previous efforts were not recapitulated in this study. Intrinsic differences between the technologies utilized may explain the partial overlap between datasets. For example, our method fails to detect in cis interactions that involve the transmembrane or cytosolic regions of the protein under study. Additionally, a majority of the protein interaction data in these resources was captured by AP-MS and therefore may occur through complex associations, in contrast to the direct interactions that are predominant in this study. Conversely, our technology is optimally suited for identification of in trans interactions that involve receptors expressed in different cell types, which is not detectable by most of the methodologies available and therefore remains significantly underrepresented in databases. Finally, given the size and diversity of our library, it is still possible that a fraction of proteins do not contain all relevant post-translational modifications, leading to false negatives. Nevertheless, previously published data ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 26. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ; Husain et al., 2019 19. Husain, B. ∙ Ramani, S.R. ∙ Chiang, E. ... A Platform for Extracellular Interactome Discovery Identifies Novel Functional Binding Partners for the Immune Receptors B7-H3/CD276 and PVR/CD155 Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2019; 18 :2310-2323 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), alongside the validation of many known and novel binding events, indicates that most library proteins are indeed properly folded and viable for identification of relevant interactions.
Although expansive in its coverage of membrane protein pairs, the IgSF Interactome network remains incomplete. For almost half of the IgSF proteins included as queries (242), we could not confidently assign interactions with STM proteins in the library. We acknowledge that some of the IgSF members studied here are bona fide receptors for secreted factors, whereas others might interact with other receptor types, such as G protein-coupled receptors, both not within the scope of the current study. In addition, although we take advantage of ectodomain oligomerization for increased avidity, our study does not address the specific oligomeric state responsible for binding for the interactions identified, an important aspect that should be evaluated in future studies. The next logical step to fully understand the functions of protein complexes in the extracellular environment is therefore to expand the current Interactome to the complete set of STM receptors as well as secreted molecules encoded by the human genome. Future studies should also assess disease-related variants, prioritizing those that are notorious to perturb protein-protein interaction networks ( Sahni et al., 2015 40. Sahni, N. ∙ Yi, S. ∙ Taipale, M. ... Widespread macromolecular interaction perturbations in human genetic disorders Cell. 2015; 161 :647-660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Enabling data-driven hypothesis building for poorly characterized proteins and assignment of new functionalities for relatively well-characterized receptors is a key aspect of this study. In this regard, incorporation of comprehensive tissue- and cell-type-specific expression resources such as GTEx, TCGA, and CCLE reveals connected network modules and expression correlation patterns that can be leveraged to infer functional relationships. Of note, although gene expression correlation has shown to be predictive of physical interactions, a poor correlation does not necessarily imply a lack of biological significance, due to the existence of complex regulatory mechanisms and incomplete information for secreted and membrane proteins in current datasets, as exemplified by the lack of protein expression data for many extracellular proteins in CCLE. The usefulness of integrating comprehensive expression datasets with physical interaction networks is well illustrated by the observation that for multiple receptor families with high sequence homology in the ectodomain, such as the LILR or the butyrophilin, distinct binding patterns emerge, suggestive of a high degree of multi-functional specialization. Multifunctional binding is a feature that is common to many well-characterized intracellular interaction networks and is also observed in this study to be present in receptor interactomes. We also define additional interactors for essential immunoregulators that have been extensively studied, such as the PD-L1 family or CD28/CTLA4 co-stimulatory proteins. It is plausible that specific interactions are observed only in certain tissue microenvironments and/or cellular activation states. In support of this hypothesis, our analyses showed tight correlations in specific tissues for many interactions, suggesting a biological context where they may be relevant. Together, this systems biology approach lays the foundation for future studies to understand plasma membrane protein biology and assess therapeutic relevance.
In agreement with this notion, integrating the IgSF Interactome with clinical data led to the identification of protein pairs binding associated with response to PD-L1 blockade and interestingly, highlighted a considerable number of cases where the expression of a specific binding partner dominated the overall predicted outcome of the interacting pair. It is plausible that alternative binding partners exert a context-dependent regulation leading to a differential signaling outcome, ultimately influencing responsiveness, as suggested for EFNB1 ( Pasquale, 2010; Orsulic and Kemler, 2000 29. Orsulic, S. ∙ Kemler, R. Expression of Eph receptors and ephrins is differentially regulated by E-cadherin J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 :1793-1802 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 32. Pasquale, E.B. Eph receptors and ephrins in cancer: bidirectional signalling and beyond Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10 :165-180 Crossref Scopus (998) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, alternative binders for receptors strongly associated with T eff function and response may play a yet unknown regulatory function that ultimately results in the poor responses observed. These examples illustrate the challenges when predicting outcomes considering only individual genes, and emphasize the need for more comprehensive predictors of clinical outcome. Given the unbiased nature of the Interactome, which defines all possible receptor communities regardless of tissue expression or cell activation state, such predictive network signatures may be applicable to dissect large patient cohorts besides the one used in this study. Further integration with cell-type-specific signatures will provide important insights into the protein interaction networks that dictate inter-cellular communication and shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying immunological surveillance and tumor immuno-evasion. As such, the IgSF Interactome represents a unique resource for understanding basic aspects of individual receptor functionalities as well as global organization of the cell surface proteome and provides fundamental insights for therapeutic target discovery.

Conditioned Media for human receptor library was prepared using Expi293F cells (Thermo-Fisher), a suspension cell line adapted from HEK293 cells (epithelial human cells, embryonic kidney). Cells were cultivated under the following conditions: 37°C, 8% CO 2 , 80% humidity and 150 rpm agitation speed. Expi293 expression medium (Life Technologies) was used as the seed train and production media. The same cell line and culture conditions were used for expression of the IgSF proteins as pentameric proteins secreted to the conditioned media. COS7 cells (fibroblast cell line derived from monkey kidney tissue, purchased from ATCC) or HEK293 cells were used for transient expression of the relevant binding partners, expressed as full-length proteins (Genentech). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine LTX with PLUS Reagent (Life Technologies) in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). Cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutmine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in a 37°C humidified, 5% CO 2 incubator.
Samples for this analysis were collected from IMvigor210, a single arm phase II study investigating atezolizumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients. Details concerning this trial can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov (Unique Identifiers: NCT02951767, NCT02108652), and previous publications ( Mariathasan et al., 2018 23.

Tumor tissues were taken from all patients 2 years prior to study entry. RECIST v1.1 was used to assess response to therapy.
The library of STM receptors was compiled by integrating computational predictions and functional annotations, followed by careful manual curation and review ( Clark et al., 2003 13. Clark, H.F. ∙ Gurney, A.L. ∙ Abaya, E. ...

An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the boundaries of the ectodomain were determined by predicting signal peptides and transmembrane helices or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linkage sites, using publicly available servers for prediction of protein features (Phobius, TMHMM, SignalP3.0). Subsequently, the ectodomain of each receptor, according to UniProt annotations, was synthesized and cloned into a pRK5 vector (Genentech) containing a C-terminal hIgG (Fc) tag. For type II STM proteins, a HSV signal sequence was inserted upstream of the N-terminal Fc tag. The resulting library consists of 1,364 prey constructs, including a number of replicate constructs as assay controls, and 1,132 unique human receptors. Similar to the STM prey library, the IgSF query collection was compiled integrating computational predictions and functional annotations, followed by careful manual curation and review ( Clark et al., 2003 13. Clark, H.F. ∙ Gurney, A.L. ∙ Abaya, E. ...

Functional clustering of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins with protein-protein interaction information calibrated hidden Markov model sequence profiles J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426 :945-961 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, a list of reviewed human proteins with predicted “Immunoglobulin-like domain superfamily” membership, according to InterPro’s SuperFamily annotations (SSF48726), was downloaded from the Uniprot database. This list was complemented with 98 selected proteins based on their participation in key biological functions. Subsequently, the aggregate list was further curated with extracellular domain boundaries and motif annotations relevant to receptor signaling functions, resulting in a collection of 445 proteins, encompassing 365 human IgSF proteins that represent ≈73% of the IgSF ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ). All IgSF query proteins were cloned as described before ( Bushell et al., 2008 8. Bushell, K.M. ∙ Söllner, C. ∙ Schuster-Boeckler, B. ...

An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ), Essentially, the ectodomain of each IgSF query protein was fused to the pentameric helical region of rat cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and β-lactamase to allow a colorimetric readout upon addition of the substrate nitrocefin. All clones were synthesized using sequences codon-optimized for mammalian cell expression.
The collection of STM receptors, cloned as ectodomains fused to a human IgG tag, was transiently transfected in human cells for expression as soluble proteins in the conditioned media. Cell culture and instrumentation for cell transfection automation have been described in detail ( Bos et al., 2015 6. Bos, A.B. ∙ Luan, P. ∙ Duque, J.N. ... Optimization and automation of an end-to-end high-throughput microscale transient protein production process Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015; 112 :1832-1842 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, transfections were performed using Expi293 (Life Technologies), a suspension adapted HEK293 line. Expi293 Expression Medium (Life Technologies) was used as the seed train and production medium. Cells were cultivated as a seed train in flasks and grown at 37°C, 5% CO 2 and 150 rpm agitation speed in a humidified incubator before transient transfection. A Tecan EVO liquid handling system and integrated MultiDrop Combi reagent dispenser was utilized for all automated cell culture operations. The prey library (Receptor ectodomain-Fc) was prepared using micro-scale 1 mL transient transfections, using an automated platform that has been recently described ( Bos et al., 2015 6. Bos, A.B. ∙ Luan, P. ∙ Duque, J.N. ... Optimization and automation of an end-to-end high-throughput microscale transient protein production process Biotechnol.

In brief, DNA was purified at the miniprep scale using a high-throughput plasmid purification system, and 1 μg of DNA was dispensed in each well. For generation of conditioned media enriched in oligomeric query proteins, 30 mL transient transfections using a total of 30 μg in each well were carried out in 50 mL tubespins processed in batches of 96 for efficiency using a Biomek FX liquid handling robot, essentially as described ( Bos et al., 2015 6.

Bioeng. 2015; 112 :1832-1842 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). 25 KDa Linear PEI was used for the transient transfection procedures, and conditioned media were harvested 7 days post-transfection.
The receptor-ligand screening technology utilized was based on the AVEXIS method ( Bushell et al., 2008 8. Bushell, K.M. ∙ Söllner, C. ∙ Schuster-Boeckler, B. ... Large-scale screening for novel low-affinity extracellular protein interactions Genome Res. 2008; 18 :622-630 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ), further implemented for automated high-throughput screening in 384 well plate format, as recently described ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 26. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, to prepare the conditioned media for the high-throughput screens, the STM prey library and IgSF query proteins were produced in a human expression system as described above in order to maximize addition of the relevant post-translational modifications. Cell transfections were performed as described, and cell cultures were grown for 7 days before removing the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 30 min. Protein A-coated plates (Thermo Scientific) were used to capture the prey library from conditioned media, by overnight incubation followed by storage at 4°C. A similar procedure was used to prepare the IgSF query proteins, which were assayed directly in the conditioned media without any capturing step. Prior to screening, the concentration of each pentameric IgSF receptor was normalized using β-lactamase activity in the conditioned media as readout. Briefly, a dilution series of the supernatant was added to nitrocefin (0.125 mg/ml) and immediately transferred to a plate reader to record absorbance at 485 nm every minute for a total of 20 min. The expression levels for each query protein were normalized to threshold levels previously determined to identify interactions of ≤ 10 μM, as described ( Bushell et al., 2008 8. Bushell, K.M. ∙ Söllner, C. ∙ Schuster-Boeckler, B. ... Large-scale screening for novel low-affinity extracellular protein interactions Genome Res. 2008; 18 :622-630 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Preparation of STM receptor library-coated plates and screening of the oligomeric IgSF proteins against the human receptor library was performed using an integrated robotic system consisting of automated liquid handling devices to allow for high-throughput analysis of protein-protein interactions while minimizing manual operations ( Martinez-Martin et al., 2018 26. Martinez-Martin, N. ∙ Marcandalli, J. ∙ Huang, C.S. ... An Unbiased Screen for Human Cytomegalovirus Identifies Neuropilin-2 as a Central Viral Receptor Cell. 2018; 174 :1158-1171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). The high-throughput screening workflow was implemented using an ATF platform, a fully automated microplate assay system that consists of several devices integrated with a robotic arm. This system was configured with a Biomek FX liquid handler with a 384-channel pipette head for plate-to-plate sample transfer, a Thermo Cytomat 9 hotel carousel for storing assay plates and tip boxes, a BioTek EL406 combination washer dispenser for washing and dispensing reagents to plates, and a BioTek MultiFlo dispenser for dispensing additional reagents. A TECAN Infinite M1000 multimode microplate reader was used to record signal from screening plates. The method was developed using Beckman Coulter SAMI software, which schedules the methods according to the number of assay plates in a run and controls the execution of the entire automated processes. Every 384 well screening plate used in this study is configured with 16 wells reporting the maximal enzymatic absorbance potential of the query construct (used as normalization control for automation procedures), 16 blank wells to report plate background (negative control) and 346 randomly spotted prey proteins from the STM library. On average, this workflow allows to screen up to 6 query proteins a day against a library consisting of 1,364 preys, spread out over 4 screening plates. The day of the screen, protein A-coated plates that had been incubated overnight with the conditioned media library were washed three times with PBS containing Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ . Subsequently, plates were incubated with the conditioned media containing the pentamerized IgSF query protein (50 μl/well) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were then washed with PBS to remove any unbound IgSF pentamer prior to addition of nitrocefin (Calbiochem) (50 μl/well). Nitrocefin turnover is observed in the presence of β-lactamase activity and is indicative of IgSF protein binding to the individual receptor captured in the well. Plates were incubated at RT for 1 h, and IgSF-STM receptor interactions were identified by measuring absorbance at 485 nm.
The concentration of each prey receptor ectodomain-Fc in the conditioned media utilized for the assays was measured using a human IgG, Fcƴ TR-FRET assay. AffiniPur F(ab’) 2 Goat anti-Human IgG, Fcƴ (Jackson ImmunoResearch) conjugated with Europium Cryptate (Cisbio Bioassays), and AlexaFluor647®-AffiniPur F(ab’) 2 Donkey anti-Human IgG, Fcƴ were used as donor and acceptor, respectively. Standards, controls and samples were diluted in assay diluent (PBS/0.5% BSA/ 0.05%Tween-20/ 15ppm Proclin), and added to 1536-well MaKO white plates (Aurora Biotechnologies). A combined donor and acceptor reagent solution was then added to each well. Plates were allowed to incubate at ambient temperature for 1 hour, following ready using a PHERAstar FS (BMG Labtech) plate reader with an excitation wavelength at 320 nm and emission wavelengths at 665 nm and 620 nm. The TR-FRET signal was reported as the ratio of the two emission wavelengths (665 nm/620 nm) multiplied by 10,000. Sample quantification was obtained by interpolating the results from a 5 parameter fit of the standard. Data was processed using a custom software.
The putative receptor-receptor interactions were analyzed by SPR, using a Biacore 8K (GE Healthcare) or Proteon instrument (Biorad). Indicated proteins were immobilized on CM5 or GLC sensors chips, respectively, using standard amino coupling method. Analytes were run at the concentrations indicated in each case, in HBS-P buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.005% surfactant P20, pH7.4) or in PBS-0.01 tween 20 when the Proteon instrument was used. For kinetic calculations, ligands were immobilized at low resonance units, and K D values were calculated in equilibrium. For kinetics experiments his-tagged recombinant proteins were used as analytes. In all cases, bulk refractive index changes were removed by substracting the reference flow responses, and sensograms were analyzed using the Proteon software version x (Biorad). Interactions between AXL and IL1RL1 and Gas6 binding partners were assayed by biolayer interferometry, using an Octet Red system, as previously described ( Husain et al., 2019 19. Husain, B. ∙ Ramani, S.R. ∙ Chiang, E. ... A Platform for Extracellular Interactome Discovery Identifies Novel Functional Binding Partners for the Immune Receptors B7-H3/CD276 and PVR/CD155 Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2019; 18 :2310-2323 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, recombinant AXL, MERTK or Tyro3 ectodomains were biotinylated in vitro using the EZ-link Sulfo-NHS biotin kit (Thermo Scientific), and captured on streptavidin-coated sensors. These receptors were tested for binding to Gas6 or IL1RL1, expressed as recombinant ectodomains assayed in PBS buffer. Data were analyzed using Forte Pall (Port Washington, NY) software 9.0. The following proteins were purchased from Sino Biologicals: CNTFR, LDLR, SLITRK4, BTN3A3. The following proteins were obtained from R&D Biosystems: CHL1, MCAM, SIRPA, CNTN1, SLITRK2, SLITRK3, LRFN5, EDAR, FLT4, PD-L1, PD-1, EPHA3, EPHA4, BTNA2A, BTN3A1, AXL, IL1RL1, VSIG10L, FLRT1, FLRT2, FLRT3, NCR1, MDGA1, TREML2, IGSF9B, LILRA3, Gas6, MERTK, Tyro3. CEACAM4, expressed as ectodomain-Fc fusions, was expressed in mammalian cells and purified in house using standard affinity chromatography techniques ( Ramani et al., 2012 37. Ramani, S.R. ∙ Tom, I. ∙ Lewin-Koh, N. ... A secreted protein microarray platform for extracellular protein interaction discovery Anal. Biochem. 2012; 420 :127-138 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The following STM proteins were expressed as full-length proteins fused a C-terminal HA tag: FAM187B, LRRC4B, LRRC4C, VSIG8, CDH9, ST14, TGOLN2, IGSF5, IL1RL1, VSIG10L, PD-L2, PD-L1, LILRA3, LILRB4, LILRB5, NCR1. The following STM proteins were expressed as full-length proteins fused a C-terminal FLAG tag: BTN2A1, BTN3A1, BTN3A2, BTN3A3, AXL, CD300A, CD300C, CD300LF, CEACAM4, EPHA3, IL6R, EDAR, ILDR1, CNTFR, LDLR, SIGLEC7, SIGLEC8, CD4. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the relevant protein pairs (expressed as HA- and Flag-tagged fusions, respectively) using Lipofectamine LTX reagent. Low plasmid concentrations were using to avoid high overexpression of the proteins. Typically, 6 × 10 5 cells were seeded in M6 well plates and reversed transfected with 1 μg of a 1:1 DNA mixture. Cell lysates were washed with PBS and lysed ∼18 hours post-transfection. RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris HCL pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 (w/v) Na-deoxycholate, 0.1 % (w/v) SDS, 1 % (v/v) NP40). Equal amounts of the lysates were incubated with EZview Red ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Millipore Sigma) at 4°C O/N, following manufacturer’s instructions. The beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer and proteins were eluted using loading buffer SDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using denaturing conditions. Immuno-precipitates were analyzed by western blotting using anti-Flag (Cell Signaling Technologies) and anti-HA antibodies (Abcam), using a LICOR instrument.
The query proteins were randomly biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Cat. No. 21217, Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. After biotinylation and buffer exchange, the query proteins were multimerized using fluorescently labeled streptavidin (Prozyme) for increased avidity and enhanced detection of transient protein-protein interactions. The indicated receptors expressed as full-length constructs (Genentech) were transiently transfected in COS7 cells. Two days after transfection the cultures were washed with PBS and blocked with 5% BSA for 20 min at room temperature. Next, the multimerized query proteins were incubated with the cells for 45 min at 4°C, washed and subsequently fixed with 4% PFA. Images were acquired using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope and analyzed using Fiji software.
TCGA ( http://www.cbioportal.org/ ), COSMIC ( https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic ) and the published information referenced in the text were mined to identify PTPRD mutations present in tumors. Mutations were selected based on domain localization, biological relevance and prevalence across tumor samples. PTPRD mutants were expressed as pentameric proteins, following the cloning procedure described for the IgSF query proteins. All clones were synthesized using codon-optimized sequences. The collection of mutants studied is shown in Table S5 .
Whole transcriptome profiles for all 298 samples were generated using TruSeq RNA Access technology. RNA reads were first aligned with the ribosomal RNA sequences to remove ribosomal reads. The remaining reads were aligned to the human reference Genome (GRCh38) using GSNAP aligner allowing maximum of two mismatches with the following parameters: -M 2 -n 10 -B 2 -i 1 -N 1 -w 200000 -E 1–pairmax-rna = 200000–clip-overlap. To quantify gene expression levels, the number of reads mapped to the exons of each RefSeq gene was calculated in a strand-specific manner using the functionality provided by the R/Bioconductor package GenomicAlignments.
First, raw enzymatic absorbance values were corrected per screened plate by subtracting the plate’s estimated background enzymatic absorbance (10%-ile) and subsequently scaling those values to the maximal enzymatic absorbance estimate (99.5%-ile) to derive a normalized absorbance value within the [0,1] range for each measured well. All absorbance controls and empty well values were filtered out and the normalized absorbance values were compiled in a query (row) by prey (column) data matrix. Using the data matrix, four predictive features were computed for each query-prey pair: 1) the normalized absorbance value 2) a query Z-score (Z-score across all preys on the 4 STM library plates for a single query); 3) a prey Z-score (Z-score per prey in the STM receptor library across all queries that were screened against it); and 4) a custom Specificity Score, computed as follows: 𝐴 𝑞 , 𝑝 𝑁 = 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑧 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑞 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑦 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 , 𝐴 𝑃 𝑁 = ∑ 𝑞 𝑖 = 1 𝑣 = 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑦 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 , 𝐴 𝑆 𝑁 = ∑ 𝑝 𝑖 = 1 𝐴 𝑃 𝑁 = 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 , 𝑆 𝑞 , 𝑝 = 2 √ 𝐴 𝑞 , 𝑝 𝑁 ∗ 𝐴 𝑆 𝑁 𝐴 𝑃 𝑁 = 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 , A supervised random forest classifier, implemented in the Caret R package, was trained using all four features on a benchmark of compiled true positive receptor interactions from literature, observed ‘non-specific’ preys from orthogonal library screens ( Table S2 ) and true negative interactions, sampled at a 1:10 positive to negative ratio from the data points below the 99-%-ile (Normalized Absorbance < 0.057). All absorbance controls were removed prior to training and prediction. The training function in Caret was configured with the following parameters: training set size 75%, test set size 25%, repeated cross-validation (N = 10, R = 10), multi-class predictions (Positive, Negative, Non-specific), grid-search parameter optimization for Random Forest (mtry = 20, .ntree = 30) and Accuracy as performance metric. The predicted ‘high-confidence’ IgSF interactome was defined by additionally filtering by the following class probabilities: P(Positive) > = 0.75, P(Non-specific) ≤ 0.25 and P(Negative) ≤ 0.05. Finally, for representation and data integration purposes all interactions identified with multiple prey constructs for identical STM receptors and bi-directionally identified interactions were summarized into a non-directional, non-redundant list of unique binding partners.
The Bioplex dataset was downloaded from the Bioplex webpage ( https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu , Hek293 v3.0 and HCT116 v1.0). The Biogrid dataset was downloaded from the Biogrid webpage ( https://thebiogrid.org , v3.4.160, physical interactions). The STRING dataset, including all STRING ‘evidence channels’, was downloaded from the STRING website (v.10.5) and filtered to retain only interactions with a STRING ‘combined score > 0.7’. A more detailed description of the calculation of combined STRING scores based on the weighted evidence channels has been previously described ( von Mering et al., 2005 49. von Mering, C. ∙ Jensen, L.J. ∙ Snel, B. ... STRING: known and predicted protein-protein associations, integrated and transferred across organisms Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :D433-D437 Crossref Scopus (1313) PubMed Google Scholar ). To compute the overlap percentages, all three protein interaction resources were restricted to the scope of binary interactions tested in this work, being the combinatorial set of all query by prey proteins. All network statistics were computed in Cytoscape (v.3.6.1) ( Shannon et al., 2003 42. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (32512) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The GTEx dataset was downloaded from the GTEx Portal webpage ( http://gtexportal.org/home/index.html , v7). Genes were matched by EntrezID (438/440 matched, 2 missing) and all RPKM expression values were recomputed by our internal RNA-Seq analysis pipeline. Tissue expression correlations between pairs of genes in GTEx were calculated as the Pearson coefficient on the log2-transformed RPKM across all tissue detail categories. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression by tissue category was performed with Ward linkage and a Pearson correlation distance and plotted as heatmaps with the ‘pheatmap’ R package. Clustering of the IgSF interactome into communities was performed in Cytoscape (v.3.6.1) using the Markov CLustering algorithm (MCL), implemented in the ClusterMaker2 plugin, with the Pearson correlation coefficients as edge weights (inflation parameter = 1.45, stop if residual increases = False, number of iterations = 500). Gene Ontology enrichment statistics were computed per MCL cluster using the ‘GOstats’ R package ( Falcon and Gentleman, 2007 17. Falcon, S. ∙ Gentleman, R. Using GOstats to test gene lists for GO term association Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :257-258 Crossref Scopus (1502) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significantly enriched GO Biological Process terms were determined by q-value < 0.05. All significant terms were manually curated and aggregated in the simplified categories depicted in Figure 3 and listed in Table S3 . All Cytoscape networks were uploaded on the NDEX portal and will be made publicly available upon publication through the portal.
The TCGA RNA-Seq data was downloaded from the NCI Genomic Data Commons PanCanAtlas Publications webpage ( https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas ). Genes were matched by EntrezID (435/440 matched, 5 missing). Differential expression between Tumor and Adjacent Normal samples was calculated with a two-sided Student’s t test for all TCGA indications with at least ten Adjacent Normal samples (15/33). All test p values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. ‘Significant’ differentially expressed genes were defined by a |log2 RSEM mean-change| > 1 and p < 0.05. To compare the number of down- and upregulated IgSF genes with a reference set of unrelated genes, 10 subsets of 435 non-IgSF genes were randomly selected from the TCGA dataset and their differential expression was computed in the same way. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the log2 RSEM mean-change for genes by tumor categories was performed with Ward linkage and Euclidean distance and plotted as heatmaps with the ‘pheatmap’ R package.
The expression clustering analysis was done as reported ( Mariathasan et al., 2018 23. Mariathasan, S. ∙ Turley, S.J. ∙ Nickles, D. ... TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (3242) PubMed Google Scholar ). 1038 most variable genes were analyzed by hierarchical clustering with Pearson correlation, complete linkage. A centroid for each subtype in the training set was generated by the average expression for each gene of a given subtype. The subtype cluster membership for each sample was determined using the maximum association criterion by calculating a Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the median centered (log 2 ) gene expression values of an individual sample compared to each of the centroid gene values for UroA, GU, Infiltrated and UroB. The subtype classification for the new sample is assigned to the centroid with the highest correlation.
To calculate scores for each of these signatures, counts were first normalized using edgeR’s normalization factors ( Robinson and Oshlack, 2010 39. Robinson, M.D. ∙ Oshlack, A. A scaling normalization method for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data Genome Biol. 2010; 11 :R25 Crossref Scopus (4967) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by filtering out genes with low coverage (i.e., not reaching 0.25 CPM (counts per million) in at least one-tenth of available samples) and log 2 -transformation using limma’s voom ( Ritchie et al., 2015 38. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21697) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene expression score for each PPI was calculated as described ( Mariathasan et al., 2018 23. Mariathasan, S. ∙ Turley, S.J. ∙ Nickles, D. ... TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (3242) PubMed Google Scholar ). A principal component analysis was performed on the z-score transformed expression of each gene, and principal component 1 was extracted to serve as gene signature scores. For the heatmap ( Figure 7 A), each sample was ordered based on Lund subtyping scheme ( Mariathasan et al., 2018 23. Mariathasan, S. ∙ Turley, S.J. ∙ Nickles, D. ... TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (3242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hierarchical clustering was performed for all the genes in the three gene expression signatures: T eff : CD8A, GZMA, GZMB, PRF1 (block A); TGFβ/stromal: TGFBR2, TGFB3, ACTA2, PDGFRB, LUM, DCN, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL6A1 and LAMA4 (block B). All genes in IgSF Interactome (block C). Z -score-transformed normalized counts are shown.
Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the probability of overall survival (OS) and to estimate the median overall survival for the IMvigor210 cohort, and Kaplan-Meier curves were produced. For OS analysis, data for patients who were alive were censored at the time of the last contact. The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for OS were estimated by a Cox regression model.
