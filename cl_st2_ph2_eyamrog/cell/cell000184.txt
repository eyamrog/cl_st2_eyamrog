Title: Phase Separation of a PKA Regulatory Subunit Controls cAMP Compartmentation and Oncogenic Signaling


Abstract: Summary

The fidelity of intracellular signaling hinges on the organization of dynamic activity architectures. Spatial compartmentation was first proposed over 30 years ago to explain how diverse G protein-coupled receptors achieve specificity despite converging on a ubiquitous messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, the mechanisms responsible for spatially constraining this diffusible messenger remain elusive. Here, we reveal that the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), RIα, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a function of cAMP signaling to form biomolecular condensates enriched in cAMP and PKA activity, critical for effective cAMP compartmentation. We further show that a PKA fusion oncoprotein associated with an atypical liver cancer potently blocks RIα LLPS and induces aberrant cAMP signaling. Loss of RIα LLPS in normal cells increases cell proliferation and induces cell transformation. Our work reveals LLPS as a principal organizer of signaling compartments and highlights the pathological consequences of dysregulating this activity architecture.

Section: Introduction

3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a universal regulator of cellular function and behavior across evolution. In eukaryotes, cAMP production is canonically triggered in response to hormone signaling via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated activation of transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (ACs), which catalyze synthesis of cAMP from ATP. cAMP signals are transduced by a number of well-studied effector proteins, most prominently cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a tetrameric holoenzyme consisting of a regulatory subunit dimer bound to a pair of catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the PKA regulatory subunit unleashes the activity of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKA cat ), which then phosphorylates a myriad of targets throughout the cell. Together, cAMP and PKA exert tight control over numerous physiological processes, from cell growth and survival ( Gottesman and Fleischmann, 1986 36. Gottesman, M.M. ∙ Fleischmann, R.D.

The functional diversity of cAMP signaling is driven by hundreds of GPCR inputs ( Kroeze et al., 2003 51. Kroeze, W.K. ∙ Sheffler, D.J. ∙ Roth, B.L. G-protein-coupled receptors at a glance J.

Patra, C. ∙ Brady, M.F. Biochemistry, cAMP StatPearls Publishing, 2018 Google Scholar ). This remarkable specificity may be achieved through compartmentation of cAMP, a concept first proposed over 35 years ago ( Brunton et al., 1981 13. Brunton, L.L. ∙ Hayes, J.S. ∙ Mayer, S.E.

Although compartmentalized AC activity is involved in forming these cAMP microdomains ( Cooper, 2003 24. Cooper, D.M.F. Regulation and organization of adenylyl cyclases and cAMP Biochem.

However, this long-standing model of PDE-controlled cAMP compartmentation is at odds with reports describing almost unrestricted (e.g., 270–780 μm 2 /s) cAMP diffusion in cells ( Bacskai et al., 1993 3.

Indeed, various computational studies have failed to reproduce formation of cAMP gradients through the sole action of PDEs ( Boras et al., 2014 8. Boras, B.W. ∙ Kornev, A. ∙ Taylor, S.S. ...

Experimental and mathematical analysis of cAMP nanodomains PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0174856 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that experimentally observed cAMP microdomains instead require substantially (∼100- to 10,000-fold) slower cAMP diffusion. Notably, more recent investigations have reported significantly lower cytosolic cAMP diffusion rates that are more conducive for cAMP compartmentalization than the original estimates ( Agarwal et al., 2016 2.

Res. 2016; 110 :395-407 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the specific mechanisms responsible for spatially constraining this critical second messenger remain to be elucidated.
Here we identify the formation of biomolecular condensates of the type I regulatory subunit of PKA, RIα, as a key driver of cAMP compartmentation. RIα undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) at endogenous levels as a function of dynamic cAMP signaling to form RIα bodies harboring high levels of cAMP and PKA activity, and this dynamic cAMP sequestration is required to spatially constrain cAMP in cells. Importantly, RIα LLPS is explicitly disrupted by a PKA cat fusion oncoprotein present in the atypical liver cancer fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) ( Honeyman et al., 2014 42. Honeyman, J.N. ∙ Simon, E.P. ∙ Robine, N. ... Detection of a recurrent DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma Science. 2014; 343 :1010-1014 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to aberrant cAMP signaling and cell transformation. Our work reveals LLPS as an essential coordinator of signaling compartments and provides critical mechanistic clues into the etiology of FLC, highlighting the pathological consequences of dysregulated signaling activity architecture.

Section: Results

Of the four non-redundant PKA regulatory subunits, only RIα is ubiquitously expressed, and it is essential for proper regulation of PKA activity ( Cadd and McKnight, 1989 16. Cadd, G. ∙ McKnight, G.S. Distinct patterns of cAMP-dependent protein kinase gene expression in mouse brain Neuron. 1989; 3 :71-79 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). To visualize the dynamics of RIα expressed at endogenous levels, we introduced the 11 th β strand of GFP (FP 11 ) ( Leonetti et al., 2016 54. Leonetti, M.D. ∙ Sekine, S. ∙ Kamiyama, D. ... A scalable strategy for high-throughput GFP tagging of endogenous human proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E3501-E3508 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ) at the C terminus of RIα via CRISPR-Cas9 in HEK293A cells, yielding the 293-RIα cell line. This small segment permits efficient knockin and enables targeted reconstitution of intact GFP when the remainder of superfolder GFP (GFP 1–10 ) is co-expressed. By doing so in 293-RIα cells, we observed fluorescent puncta ( Figure 1 A) similar to those seen with overexpressed RIα ( Day et al., 2011 25. Day, M.E. ∙ Gaietta, G.M. ∙ Sastri, M. ... Isoform-specific targeting of PKA to multivesicular bodies J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193 :347-363 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mavrakis et al., 2006 62. Mavrakis, M. ∙ Lippincott-Schwartz, J. ∙ Stratakis, C.A. ...

Genet. 2006; 15 :2962-2971 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). These puncta are highly dynamic, and coalescence of dispersed puncta occurred on the minute scale ( Figure 1 B; Video S1 ). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicated that labeled RIα can dynamically exchange between the puncta and diffusible pools, as indicated by similar fluorescence recovery kinetics (time to half maximum [t 1/2 ] of 7 s ± 0.44 s, mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM] indicated throughout the paper, n = 12 puncta versus t 1/2 of 7.8 s ± 0.41 s, n = 5 cytosolic regions) ( Figure 1 C; Video S2 ), although labeled RIα showed decreased mobility within puncta (t 1/2 , 35 s ± 1.3 s; n = 9 regions inside RIα puncta; p < 0.0001; Figure S1 A). In addition, treatment with 2.5% 1,6-hexanediol (Hex), which disrupts weak intermolecular forces present in liquid-like assemblies ( Peskett et al., 2018 70.

Cell. 2018; 70 :588-601.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ), reduced the number of endogenous RIα puncta per cell by 68% ± 8.6% ( Figure 1 D).

Strikingly, purified RIα by itself formed liquid droplets in vitro ( Figure 1 E). Increasing molecular crowding with increasing concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) decreased the concentrations of RIα needed for liquid droplet formation ( Figure 1 F), whereas increasing salt (KCl) concentrations increased the concentrations of RIα needed for liquid droplet formation ( Figure S1 B). RIα droplets varied in size in vitro and in cells ( Figure S1 C), and although endogenous RIα puncta account for only 0.09% ± 0.02% of the entire cellular volume, we estimated the RIα concentration inside these puncta to be about 5.5 μM ( Figures S1 D and S1E). We also observed similar fluorescent puncta in various other cell types expressing RIα-GFP, such as cardiomyocytes, astrocytes, and neurons ( Figures S1 F–S1H). Together, these data indicate that RIα is capable of forming biomolecular condensates and that it does so at endogenous expression levels.
RIα forms an obligate dimer via its N-terminal dimerization and docking (D/D) domain, which bridges its binding to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Connecting the D/D domain and cAMP binding domains is a linker region that is relatively disordered ( STAR Methods ) and contains an inhibitory sequence that acts as a pseudosubstrate for PKA cat ( Figure 2 A; Kim et al., 2005 50. Kim, C. ∙ Xuong, N.-H. ∙ Taylor, S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA Science. 2005; 307 :690-696 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). To probe the role of these domains in RIα LLPS, we generated a panel of EGFP-tagged RIα truncation mutants and monitored their ability to form puncta when overexpressed in wild-type HEK293T cells. No puncta were observed with mutants lacking the D/D domain or the linker region ( Figures 2 B and S2 A–S2E), in contrast to the wild-type control, whereas fluorescent puncta were observed in cells expressing a truncation mutant containing only these two regions ( Figure 2 B). These data suggest that a segment containing the D/D domain and linker region is necessary and, to some extent, sufficient for RIα LLPS.
The inhibitory sequence and a portion of the linker region become disordered when cAMP-bound RIα is dissociated from PKA cat ( Kim et al., 2005 50. Kim, C. ∙ Xuong, N.-H. ∙ Taylor, S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA Science. 2005; 307 :690-696 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because this region is involved in RIα LLPS, we hypothesized that PKA cat and cAMP might directly influence this process. Indeed, increasing concentrations of purified PKA cat increased the minimal RIα concentration required for liquid droplet formation in vitro ( Figure 2 C). Moreover, overexpression of PKA cat in GFP 1–10 -expressing 293-RIα cells decreased the number of endogenous RIα puncta per cell by 67% (p = 0.001; −PKA cat , n = 18 cells; +PKA cat , n = 16 cells) in the basal state ( Figure S2 F).
On the other hand, cAMP directly enhances RIα LLPS in the presence of PKA cat because addition of cAMP attenuated the inhibitory effect of PKA cat on RIα liquid droplet formation in vitro and allowed liquid droplet formation at lower RIα concentrations ( Figure 2 C). In 293-RIα cells expressing GFP 1–10 , stimulation with the AC activator forskolin (Fsk) to elevate cAMP induced an acute increase in endogenous RIα puncta (70% ± 12%, n = 32 cells) ( Figures 2 D and 2F). Furthermore, increasing cAMP levels through the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol transiently increased the number of endogenous RIα puncta per cell ( Figure 2 F), consistent with the cAMP dynamics induced by this GPCR agonist ( DiPilato and Zhang, 2009 30. DiPilato, L.M. ∙ Zhang, J. The role of membrane microdomains in shaping beta2-adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP dynamics Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5 :832-837 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rich et al., 2001 73. Rich, T.C. ∙ Fagan, K.A. ∙ Tse, T.E. ... A uniform extracellular stimulus triggers distinct cAMP signals in different compartments of a simple cell Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :13049-13054 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data suggest that cAMP-bound RIα is more prone to undergo LLPS, consistent with an increase in disorder within the inhibitory sequence and linker region when cAMP-bound RIα dissociates from PKA cat . To observe the localization of PKA cat in this process, we stimulated HEK293T cells overexpressing RIα and PKA cat with Fsk and observed a 164% ± 32% increase in the number of RIα puncta per cell, and PKA cat co-localized with RIα puncta ( Figures 2 E, S2 G, and S2H; Video S3 ; n = 22 cells). Consistent with this observation, PKA cat (1% GFP-tagged) formed liquid droplets in vitro when mixed with RIα and cAMP ( Figure 2 G) but did not form liquid droplets on its own ( Figure S5 B). These results suggest that cAMP dynamics dictate formation and dissolution of RIα phase-separated bodies and that PKA cat co-phase-separates with RIα.

Fsk Induces Formation of RIα Phase-Separated Bodies and Co-phase Separation of PKAcat, Related to Figure 2 Epifluorescence imaging of HEK293T cells expressing EGFP-RIα (left) and mCherry-PKA cat (right). During imaging, cells were stimulated with 50 μM Fsk to observe RIα puncta formation. Scale bar, 10 μm.4
The observed enrichment of PKA cat in RIα phase-separated bodies prompted us to directly probe PKA activity in these bodies. To perform these measurements at the endogenous level, we designed fluorescent sensors targeted to endogenous proteins (FluoSTEPs), a class of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors that contain sensing domains sandwiched between mRuby2 (acceptor) and GFP 1–10 (partial donor). The FRET donor fully reconstitutes in the presence of GFP 11 fused to an endogenous protein of interest, resulting in assembly of functional biosensors only at endogenous protein loci. We designed FluoSTEP-AKAR based on previously established PKA activity-sensing domain consisting of a surrogate PKA substrate sequence (LRRA T LVD) and forkhead associated domain 1 (FHA1) as the phosphoamino acid-binding domain ( Figure 3 A; Zhang et al., 2005 96. Zhang, J. ∙ Hupfeld, C.J. ∙ Taylor, S.S. ... Insulin disrupts beta-adrenergic signalling to protein kinase A in adipocytes Nature. 2005; 437 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). When PKA is active, phosphorylation of the PKA substrate and its subsequent binding to FHA1 are expected to induce a conformational change and an increase in the red/green emission ratio ( Figure S3 A).
In 293-RIα cells expressing FluoSTEP-AKAR, Fsk induced a 4.7% ± 0.35% increase in the red/green emission ratio (raw emission ratios [R]: R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.82 to 0.86; n = 35 cells) in diffuse RIα regions ( Figure 3 B) but no detectable changes within RIα puncta (R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.88 to 0.86; n = 32 cells), indicating clear differences in PKA activity despite the limited dynamic range of this first-generation technology. Conversely, the cell-permeable, myristoylated Protein Kinase A inhibitor (PKI) induced no detectable ratio changes in diffuse RIα regions (R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.79 to 0.81; n = 17 cells) under the same conditions but induced a 9.6% ± 1.1% (R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.89 to 0.81; n = 18 cells) decrease in the red/green emission ratio in RIα puncta ( Figure 3 C), suggesting that basal PKA activity within RIα phase-separated bodies is high enough to saturate FluoSTEP-AKAR prior to stimulation. Indeed, prior to any stimulation, the initial red/green emission ratio was higher in RIα puncta regions compared with diffuse RIα regions ( Figure 3 D). As a control, 293-RIα cells transfected with FluoSTEP-AKAR T/A, which contains a threonine-to-alanine (T/A) mutation within the PKA substrate ( Zhang et al., 2005 96. Zhang, J. ∙ Hupfeld, C.J. ∙ Taylor, S.S. ... Insulin disrupts beta-adrenergic signalling to protein kinase A in adipocytes Nature. 2005; 437 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed no significant red/green ratio difference between RIα puncta and diffuse regions ( Figure 3 D). The observed high basal emission ratio is consistent with enrichment of PKA activity in RIα phase-separated bodies, although exclusion of phosphatases from RIα condensates could also contribute to the observed effect.
To similarly probe cAMP dynamics within RIα puncta, we utilized a FluoSTEP indicator of cAMP using Epac (ICUE) designed based on the same split biosensor approach ( Figure 3 A). After reconstitution of the donor fluorophore, cAMP binding to a truncated fragment of Epac1, a previously established cAMP-sensing domain ( DiPilato and Zhang, 2009 30. DiPilato, L.M. ∙ Zhang, J. The role of membrane microdomains in shaping beta2-adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP dynamics Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5 :832-837 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ) that includes the cAMP binding domain, Ras exchange motif (REM), and guanine exchange factor (GEF) domain, induces a conformational change and an increase in the green/red emission ratio ( Figures S3 B and S3C). In 293-RIα cells transfected with FluoSTEP-ICUE, Fsk induced no detectable changes in RIα punctum regions (R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.61 to 0.61; n = 25 cells) but induced a 4.9% ± 0.4% increase in the green/red emission ratio in diffuse RIα regions (R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.57 to 0.59; n = 29 cells) ( Figure 3 E), suggesting that basal cAMP levels in RIα phase-separated bodies are also able to saturate FluoSTEP-ICUE prior to stimulation. As an indication of basal cAMP levels, the initial green/red emission ratio for FluoSTEP-ICUE was higher in RIα punctum regions compared with diffuse RIα regions, whereas introducing an R279E mutation to inhibit cAMP binding ( DiPilato et al., 2004 31. DiPilato, L.M. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Zhang, J. Fluorescent indicators of cAMP and Epac activation reveal differential dynamics of cAMP signaling within discrete subcellular compartments Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :16513-16518 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ) abolished this difference ( Figure 3 F). Importantly, the dynamic range of our cAMP biosensor was not affected by localization to RIα puncta, as demonstrated by identical green/red emission ratio increases inside and outside of puncta in cells expressing RIα-tethered green/red ICUE and treated with the AC inhibitor MDL-12330A (MDL) followed by a cAMP analog ( Figure S3 D). Notably, the emission ratio of the punctum-localized sensor gradually decreased to that in diffuse regions after MDL addition ( Figure S3 D), and a fluorescently labeled cAMP analog (8-Φ-450-cAMP) localized almost exclusively to RIα liquid droplets in vitro ( Figures S3 E–S3G), further supporting high basal cAMP levels within these puncta.
Next, we examined how PKA activity and cAMP dynamics changed during formation of RIα puncta. In PKA cat -expressing 293-RIα cells that showed Fsk-induced punctum formation ( Figure S2 F), Fsk induced a larger increase in the FluoSTEP-AKAR red/green emission ratio (8.6% ± 0.63%; R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.8 to 0.87; n = 27 cells) in newly formed RIα puncta compared with the constantly diffuse RIα regions (4.8% ± 0.35%; R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.8 to 0.82; n = 27 cells) ( Figure 3 G). Similarly, Fsk-induced FluoSTEP-ICUE responses were larger in newly formed RIα puncta (8.4% ± 0.66%; R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.55 to 0.59; n = 35 cells) compared with the constantly diffuse RIα regions (4.3% ± 0.34%; R t = 0 to R t = end , 0.55 to 0.57; n = 36 cells) ( Figure 3 H). These results suggest that RIα phase-separated bodies recruit and retain active PKA cat and cAMP.
Although cAMP degradation by PDEs has been shown to help create cAMP compartments in cells, PDE activity alone appears to be insufficient to restrict cAMP, given the current understanding of cAMP diffusion characteristics ( Boras et al., 2014 8. Boras, B.W. ∙ Kornev, A. ∙ Taylor, S.S. ... Using Markov state models to develop a mechanistic understanding of protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIα activation in response to cAMP binding J. Biol.

A Computational Modeling and Simulation Approach to Investigate Mechanisms of Subcellular cAMP Compartmentation PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12 :e1005005 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Key mechanisms that enable cAMP compartmentation therefore await discovery. Given the high level of cAMP observed in RIα condensates, we hypothesized that these bodies help compartmentalize cAMP by serving as a dynamic buffering system. Using an improved cAMP sensor (ICUE4) ( Figures S4 A and S4B) fused to the catalytic portion of PDE4D2 (PDE4D2 cat ) (PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4) ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and S4 C) to monitor local cAMP within PDE compartments ( Bock et al., 2020 6. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530 this issue Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar , this issue of Cell ) as a direct assay for cAMP compartmentation, we found that Fsk induced a small increase in the normalized cyan/yellow emission ratio of only 6.2% ± 0.23% (n = 55 cells), whereas blocking PDE activity by using the PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram and a general PDE inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), rescued the response, suggesting that PDE4D2 cat can form a cAMP sink under control conditions when the cAMP compartmentation system is intact ( Figure 4 B). However, when RIα LLPS was disrupted with 2.5% 1,6-hexanediol pretreatment ( Figures 4 B and S4 D–S4F), Fsk induced much greater cAMP accumulation around PDE4D2, indicated by a larger increase in the normalized cyan/yellow emission ratio (30% ± 0.76%, p < 0.0001; n = 50 cells) of the PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 probe, suggesting that disrupting RIα condensates leads to decreased cAMP buffering and loss of effective cAMP compartmentation. In cells with no RIα LLPS because RIα is homozygously knocked out, Fsk induced similar changes with and without 1,6-hexanediol pretreatment ( Figure 4 C), suggesting that the effect on cAMP compartmentation is mediated by RIα. The effect of disrupting RIα condensates was even stronger when RIα was overexpressed. In control cells, Fsk induced no detectable changes in the normalized PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 emission ratio (−0.40% ± 0.055%, n = 72 cells), suggesting that RIα overexpression further enhances cAMP compartmentation. In sharp contrast, when RIα LLPS was disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol pretreatment, Fsk stimulation induced a large 65% ± 2.0% (n = 30 cells) increase in the normalized emission ratio ( Figure 4 D) (p < 0.0001). Moreover, RIα LLPS decreased basal cAMP levels around the PDE4D2 compartment because the initial cyan/yellow emission ratios for PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 were lower when RIα was present versus when RIα was knocked out ( Figure S4 G).
To identify the key determinants of RIα-mediated cAMP compartmentation, we expressed mRuby2-tagged RIα D/D+linker , which can phase-separate but does not bind cAMP, and mRuby2-tagged RIα ΔD/D+linker , which can bind to cAMP but cannot phase-separate, in RIα-null cells and measured cAMP levels around PDE4D2 cat . In both cases, Fsk treatment induced significant increases in cAMP levels around PDE4D2 cat irrespective of 1,6-hexanediol pretreatment, and basal cAMP levels around the PDE4D2 compartment were also elevated; the initial cyan/yellow emission ratios for PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 were higher for both mutants compared with wild-type RIα ( Figures S4 G–S4L). These data suggest that formation of RIα condensates and the ability of RIα to sequester cAMP are required for effective cAMP compartmentalization. Moreover, experiments using dye-labeled cAMP suggest that cAMP is essentially “trapped” in the RIα condensates ( Figures S3 E, S3F, and 4 E). Overall, these results highlight a key mechanism of cAMP compartmentation where RIα condensates enable PDEs to function as local cAMP sinks to drive cAMP signaling specificity.
Disruption of RIα phase separation leads to defective cAMP compartmentation, and the aberrant cAMP/PKA signaling caused by altered cAMP compartmentation is linked to various diseases ( Caretta and Mucignat-Caretta, 2011 19.

FLC is an atypical liver cancer that primarily affects young adults with no pre-existing liver conditions ( Sergi, 2015 79. Sergi, C.M. Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Fibrolamellar Variant: Diagnostic Pathologic Criteria and Molecular Pathology Update. A Primer Diagnostics (Basel). 2015; 6 :3 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ), making the etiology of this cancer enigmatic. Although the DnaJB1-PKA cat fusion oncogene is detected in nearly all FLC patients, the mechanism by which this fusion protein drives FLC is completely unknown ( Honeyman et al., 2014 42. Honeyman, J.N. ∙ Simon, E.P. ∙ Robine, N. ...

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :13076-13084 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, we observed an almost complete absence of RIα puncta formation in HEK293T cells overexpressing DnaJB1-PKA cat and RIα compared with cells overexpressing wild-type PKA cat and RIα ( Figures 5 A and 5B), consistent with the inhibitory role of DnaJB1-PKA cat on RIα droplet formation in vitro ( Figure S5 A). A kinase-dead, ATP binding-deficient mutant of DnaJB1-PKA cat , DnaJB1-PKA cat K72H , which does not induce FLC in animal models ( Kastenhuber et al., 2017 49.

USA. 2017; 114 :13076-13084 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), restored RIα LLPS when co-expressed ( Figure 5 A and 5B), presumably because of reduced affinity for RIα ( Lu et al., 2019 59.

USA. 2019; 116 :16347-16356 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fsk also failed to induce any significant increases in RIα LLPS when DnaJB1-PKA cat or DnaJB1-PKA cat K72H was co-expressed with RIα, in contrast to wild-type PKA cat ( Figures 5 C and S5 C; Video S4 ), with little RIα LLPS observed in the case of DnaJB1-PKA cat and many RIα puncta observed in the case of DnaJB1-PKA cat K72H .

N-terminal fusion of the 70 amino-acid consensus sequence from DnaJ chaperones such as DnaJB1 (J-domain) abolishes PKA cat myristoylation ( Bastidas et al., 2012 5. Bastidas, A.C. ∙ Deal, M.S. ∙ Steichen, J.M. ... Role of N-terminal myristylation in the structure and regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 422 :215-229 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) and recruits the Hsp70 chaperone to the fusion protein ( Turnham et al., 2019 88. Turnham, R.E. ∙ Smith, F.D. ∙ Kenerson, H.L. ... An acquired scaffolding function of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion contributes to oncogenic signaling in fibrolamellar carcinoma eLife. 2019; 8 :1-27 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ). Therefore, we next tested the effect of PKA cat myristoylation and Hsp70 recruitment by the J-domain on RIα LLPS. Mutating the myristoylation site in wild-type PKA cat (PKA cat G1A ) significantly decreased the numbers of RIα puncta under basal and Fsk stimulation conditions ( Figure 5 D). Intriguingly, adding an N-terminal sequence to restore myristoylation to DnaJB1-PKA cat partially reversed the abolishing effect of DnaJB1-PKA cat on basal RIα LLPS ( Figure 5 D). Furthermore, disrupting the ability of the J-domain to recruit the Hsp70 chaperone by introducing an H33Q mutation ( Turnham et al., 2019 88. Turnham, R.E. ∙ Smith, F.D. ∙ Kenerson, H.L. ... An acquired scaffolding function of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion contributes to oncogenic signaling in fibrolamellar carcinoma eLife. 2019; 8 :1-27 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ) in DnaJB1-PKA cat restored cAMP-responsive formation of RIα biomolecular condensates ( Figure 5 D). Combining these two alterations partially restored basal and Fsk-stimulated punctum formation ( Figure 5 D). Collectively, these results show that DnaJB1-PKA cat strongly suppresses basal and cAMP-responsive RIα LLPS, which are partly mediated by loss of myristoylation and binding to Hsp70, respectively.
Given that RIα LLPS is essential to enable cAMP compartmentation, we expect that DnaJB1-PKA cat -induced loss of RIα LLPS should lead to defective cAMP compartmentation. We therefore tested the effect of DnaJB1-PKA cat using our PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 cAMP compartmentation assay. In cells expressing wild-type PKA cat and RIα, Fsk induced no detectable changes in the normalized cyan/yellow emission ratio of PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 (2.0% ± 1.5%, n = 30 cells) but induced a large (31% ± 1.3%, n = 24 cells) increase in the normalized cyan/yellow emission ratio under these same conditions when RIα LLPS was disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol pretreatment ( Figure 5 E) (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, cells overexpressing DnaJB1-PKA cat showed similar Fsk-induced PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 responses regardless of 1,6-hexanediol pretreatment ( Figure 5 E). However, in the presence of DnaJB1-PKA cat K72H , which restores RIα LLPS, Fsk again induced only a small increase in the normalized PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 emission ratio (5.4% ± 1.2%, n = 29 cells) versus a much larger (29% ± 2.8%, n = 18 cells) increase when RIα LLPS was disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol pretreatment ( Figure 5 E; p < 0.0001). Altogether, these data show that disruption of RIα LLPS by DnaJB1-PKA cat dramatically impairs cAMP compartmentation, providing a mechanistic clue for aberrant signaling caused by this oncoprotein fusion.
A critical question is whether loss of RIα LLPS and subsequent disruption of cAMP compartmentation could have a functional effect on cellular processes, particularly with respect to tumorigenesis. To test the functional consequences of loss of RIα LLPS, we generated an RIα-null cell line by using non-tumorigenic hepatocytic AML12 cells in which we stably expressed wild-type or various mutant forms of RIα and measured their proliferation rates and transformation capabilities. Strikingly, loss of RIα increased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis by 2-fold compared with wild-type cells. In RIα-null cells, re-expressing wild-type RIα rescued the wild-type phenotype, whereas stably expressing RIα mutants that were defective in LLPS or cAMP binding failed to rescue ( Figures 5 F and 5G; p < 0.0001). Moreover, loss of RIα led to formation of detectable colonies on soft agar ( Figures 5 H and S5 D; p < 0.0001), suggesting that loss of RIα leads to anchorage-independent growth, a hallmark of cancer cells. Similar to what was observed for cell proliferation, restoration of wild-type RIα in RIα-null cells inhibited colony formation, whereas RIα-null cells expressing RIα mutants that were defective in LLPS or cAMP binding continued to exhibit anchorage-independent growth ( Figures 5 H and S5 D; p < 0.0001). These results suggest that loss of RIα LLPS and disrupted cAMP compartmentation lead to tumorigenic phenotypes in hepatocytes. Similar results were also observed with mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( Figures S5 E–S5G), suggesting that the tumor-suppressive nature of RIα LLPS has broad implications.

Section: Discussion

cAMP compartmentation is crucial for our understanding of how this pathway achieves signaling specificity ( Baillie, 2009 4. Baillie, G.S.

Local degradation of cAMP has been suggested as a key mechanism in spatially constraining cAMP and forming cAMP compartments ( Conti et al., 2014 23. Conti, M. ∙ Mika, D. ∙ Richter, W.

Lohse, C. ∙ Bock, A. ∙ Maiellaro, I. ... Experimental and mathematical analysis of cAMP nanodomains PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0174856 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, our companion paper ( Bock et al., 2020 6. Bock, A. ∙ Annibale, P. ∙ Konrad, C. ... Optical mapping of cAMP signaling at the nanometer scale Cell. 2020; 182 :1519-1530 this issue Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ) estimated a PDE4A1 turnover number of ∼160 molecules/s in intact cells, ∼30 times faster than in vitro estimates ( Lohse et al., 2017 58. Lohse, C. ∙ Bock, A. ∙ Maiellaro, I. ... Experimental and mathematical analysis of cAMP nanodomains PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0174856 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). They further revealed that cAMP appears to be largely immobile in the basal state, exhibiting buffered diffusion, which results in low free cAMP concentrations and ultimately allows PDEs to create functionally relevant nanodomains of low cAMP concentration. Here we showed that RIα biomolecular condensates act as a dynamic “sponge” in recruiting and retaining cAMP and active PKA cat , processes required for cAMP compartmentation, because disrupting these condensates leads to loss of PDE-mediated cAMP sinks. This work thus fills a key gap in our understanding of this fundamental process by uncovering a crucial mechanism to enable cAMP compartmentation. Thermodynamically, RIα phase-separated bodies and the surrounding cytosol can be considered mixtures of cAMP, RIα, and all other components present. Formation of droplets via LLPS and the non-stoichiometric increase in cAMP in these droplets point to differences in chemical potential ( Denbigh, 1951 27. Denbigh, K.G.

Thermodynamics of irreversible processes: applications to diffusion and rheology Wiley, 1994 Google Scholar ) underlying the cAMP concentration difference between RIα bodies and the cytosol. This discovery of a critical cAMP compartmentation system mediated by LLPS might ultimately redefine our understanding of how cAMP compartmentation shapes the cAMP/PKA signaling landscape to achieve functional diversity. Future studies will further characterize RIα biomolecular condensates to determine whether other components, such as AKAPs and phosphatases, are present.
Increasing evidence suggests that LLPS acts as a principal organizer of numerous cellular processes, such as actin polymerization ( Li et al., 2012 56. Li, P. ∙ Banjade, S. ∙ Cheng, H.-C. ...

Although many macromolecules have been shown to undergo LLPS in cells, how LLPS affects their biochemical activities and functions is often unclear. By engineering FluoSTEPs, we can measure enzyme activity and small-molecule dynamics directly in biomolecular condensates without perturbing the expression levels of their individual constituents. Here we targeted FluoSTEPs to endogenous RIα and measured high cAMP levels and PKA activity in RIα bodies. cAMP levels and PKA activity were particularly enriched and retained in newly formed RIα bodies, suggesting that these condensates dynamically buffer cAMP. These live-cell activity measurements were essential for generating our hypothesis, which led us to discover the cellular function of RIα bodies as a key cAMP compartmentation system critical for signaling specificity in the cAMP/PKA pathway. Because FluoSTEPs have the same modular design as all FRET-based sensors ( Greenwald et al., 2018 38. Greenwald, E.C. ∙ Mehta, S. ∙ Zhang, J. Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Biosensors Illuminate the Spatiotemporal Regulation of Signaling Networks Chem.

Visualizing dynamic activities of signaling enzymes using genetically encodable FRET-based biosensors from designs to applications Methods Enzymol. 2012; 504 :317-340 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), their application is expandable to monitor other signaling activities and should aid in further elucidating the organizing principles of cellular activity architectures, including the role of phase-separated enzymatic assemblies in other systems.
FLC is atypical among liver cancers because it is not correlated with age, cirrhosis, or common markers of liver disease ( Sergi, 2015 79. Sergi, C.M. Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Fibrolamellar Variant: Diagnostic Pathologic Criteria and Molecular Pathology Update. A Primer Diagnostics (Basel). 2015; 6 :3 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). Although the DnaJB1-PKA cat fusion oncoprotein has been reported to be present in the majority of FLC patients ( Dinh et al., 2017 29. Dinh, T.A. ∙ Vitucci, E.C.M. ∙ Wauthier, E. ...

Detection of a recurrent DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma Science. 2014; 343 :1010-1014 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ), the pathological mechanisms of this oncogenic fusion are completely unknown. From a structural and biochemical standpoint, DnaJB1-PKA cat is largely indistinguishable from wild-type PKA cat with respect to interaction interface and binding affinity for PKA regulatory subunits ( Cao et al., 2019 18.

Res. 2016; 80 :110-118 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, although DnaJB1-PKA cat is expressed at approximately 10-fold higher levels than wild-type PKA cat because of promoter alterations ( Riggle et al., 2016 75. Riggle, K.M. ∙ Riehle, K.J. ∙ Kenerson, H.L. ... Enhanced cAMP-stimulated protein kinase A activity in human fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma Pediatr. Res. 2016; 80 :110-118 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), overexpressing wild-type PKA cat does not induce tumor formation in mice ( Kastenhuber et al., 2017 49. Kastenhuber, E.R. ∙ Lalazar, G. ∙ Houlihan, S.L. ... DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion kinase interacts with β-catenin and the liver regenerative response to drive fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :13076-13084 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that expression differences alone are not likely to be the determining factor. Our study provides a mechanistic link between DnaJB1-PKA cat and tumorigenesis. DnaJB1-PKA cat abolishes RIα LLPS, disrupting cAMP compartmentation and deregulating cAMP/PKA signaling. Furthermore, loss of RIα LLPS in non-tumorigenic hepatocytes and fibroblasts leads to tumorigenic phenotypes such as increased cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, a subset of FLC patients lack the DnaJB1-PKA cat oncogene but exhibit loss of RIα protein expression ( Graham et al., 2018 37. Graham, R.P. ∙ Lackner, C. ∙ Terracciano, L. ... Fibrolamellar carcinoma in the Carney complex: PRKAR1A loss instead of the classic DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion Hepatology. 2018; 68 :1441-1447 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), corroborating our model that loss of RIα LLPS is a key driver of FLC. Mechanistically, loss of myristylation and gain of Hsp70 binding ( Turnham et al., 2019 88. Turnham, R.E. ∙ Smith, F.D. ∙ Kenerson, H.L. ... An acquired scaffolding function of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion contributes to oncogenic signaling in fibrolamellar carcinoma eLife. 2019; 8 :1-27 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ) by DnaJB1-PKA cat are partially responsible for blocking RIα LLPS, but other mechanisms might also be involved. Intriguingly, DnaJB1-PKA cat and the related fusion oncoprotein ATP1B1-PKA cat have been detected in intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms ( Singhi et al., 2020 81. Singhi, A.D. ∙ Wood, L.D. ∙ Parks, E. ...

Although multiple studies have shown that emergence or enhancement of LLPS is linked to stress conditions or neurological disease states ( Jain et al., 2016 45.

Tau protein liquid-liquid phase separation can initiate tau aggregation EMBO J. 2018; 37 :1-21 Crossref Scopus (641) PubMed Google Scholar ), our work provides a distinct example of LLPS being necessary for normal cellular function, with loss of LLPS leading to disease phenotypes, where only a limited number of examples exist ( Bouchard et al., 2018 10.

In summary, we discovered a membraneless organelle that shapes the PKA signaling landscape. Our results represent a conceptual leap forward in understanding how the cAMP/PKA pathway is dynamically organized. Given the universal nature of cAMP/PKA signaling and the ubiquitous expression of RIα ( Cadd and McKnight, 1989 16. Cadd, G. ∙ McKnight, G.S.

Furthermore, we discovered a link between spatially dysregulated cAMP/PKA signaling and cancer. Overall, our findings showcase the intricacies of signaling activity architectures and the importance of biomolecular condensates in their construction.

The sequences for FluoSTEP-ICUE and FluoSTEP-AKAR have been uploaded onto GenBank (FluoSTEP-ICUE: MT800777.1; FluoSTEP-AKAR: MT800778.1).
HEK293A, HEK293T, and MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, GIBCO) containing 1 g L −1 glucose and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and 1% (v/v) penicillin–streptomycin (Pen-Strep, Sigma-Aldrich). AML12 cells were cultured in DMEM:F12 medium (Thermo Fisher) containing 10% FBS, 10 μg mL −1 insulin, 5.5 μg mL −1 transferrin, 5 ng mL −1 selenium (ITS liquid media supplement, Sigma-Aldrich), and 40 ng mL −1 dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). All cells were maintained in a 37°C incubator with a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Before transfection, HEK293A and HEK293T cells were plated onto sterile poly-D-lysine coated 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes and grown to 50%–70% confluence. HEK293A and HEK293T cells were then transfected using Polyjet (Signagen) and grown for an additional 16-24 h before imaging.
Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were isolated from cardiac ventricles of 1- to 2-day-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River) as described previously ( Miyamoto et al., 2010 63.

Neonatal myocytes were plated at a density of 3.0 × 10 4 cm −2 on laminin-coated 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes and maintained in DMEM with 15% FBS overnight. Cells were transfected 24 h later using Polyjet for 48 h, with the media changed 24 h after transfection. Primary rat hippocampal neurons and glial cells were harvested from male and female E19 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River) in ice-cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, GIBCO) and were dissociated using the Papain Dissociation System with MgSO 4 and DNase I according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Dissociated neurons and glial cells were diluted to 200,000 cells mL −1 and resuspended in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher) with 2% SM1 supplement (STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were plated onto 35-mm glass-bottom dishes coated with 100 μg mL −1 poly-D-lysine (Sigma) and cultured in a 37°C incubator with a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere.

To generate 293-RIα cells, HEK293A cells were plated in 6-well plates. After 24 h, 1 μg of px459 plasmid ( Ran et al., 2013 71. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ...

Cells were passaged 1 day after transfection into a 60-mm dish, and 1 μg mL −1 puromycin was added 24 h later. When no viable cells remained in the untransfected dish (around 2-3 days), the media was replenished without puromycin. Cells were passaged 24 h later and resuspended in sorting buffer (1 x DPBS with 0.5% BSA, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7, 2.5 μg mL −1 of DNase I (Thermo Fisher)) with 0.1 μg mL −1 DAPI (Thermo Fisher). Cells were sorted for DAPI-negative staining and plated as single cells in a 96-well plate using a BD FACS Aria II Cell Sorter. After 3 weeks of incubation, wells containing single-cell colonies were passaged, and DNA was extracted for genotyping using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN).

After 16 h of expression under 0.5 mM IPTG at 16°C, the cell pellets were collected and then re-suspended and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM MES, pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, and 5 mM DTT plus protease inhibitors and 10 μM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)). The supernatant was collected after high-speed centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 1 h) and incubated overnight with cAMP-resin at 4°C. After centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 10 min) and removal of the supernatant, the resin was then washed sequentially with lysis buffer, wash buffer (20 mM MES, pH 6.5, 600 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, and 5 mM DTT), and lysis buffer again.

USA. 2019; 116 :16347-16356 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) and fuses EGFP to His 6 with a -GSS- linker and EGFP to PKA cat with a -GSAGSAAGSGEF- linker. The plasmid was transformed into Rosetta pLysS (DE3) cells and inoculated in LB media with 50 μg mL −1 kanamycin. Cultures were induced at OD 600 = 0.6-0.8. After 16 h of expression under 0.5 mM IPTG at 18°C, the pellets were collected, re-suspended, and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 5 mM BME).

To purify sfGFP, the pRSET B sfGFP construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and inoculated in LB media with 100 μg mL −1 ampicillin. Cultures were induced at OD 600 = 0.6-1.0. After 6 h of expression under 0.5 mM IPTG at 37°C, the cell pellets were collected, re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl) containing 1 mM PMSF and Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), and lysed by sonication. Following centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, the clarified lysate was loaded onto an Ni-NTA column, washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole), and then eluted using an imidazole gradient (20-200 mM in lysis buffer). The eluted proteins were then concentrated, and the sfGFP protein concentration was measured via BCA assay and absorbance.
All liquid droplet formation assays were performed in 150 mM KCl (unless specified), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 μM cAMP (as indicated), 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM ATP, and 100 mg/ml Polyethylene Glycol 4000 (unless specified). Purified proteins were incubated at different stoichiometries and at various concentrations at room temperature for 1 h and imaged under DIC and/or fluorescence microscopy.
Puncta RIα concentrations were estimated based on calibration of fluorescent protein intensity on the same imaging system used to generate the data shown in Figures 1 A, 1B, 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , and S5 . Briefly, known concentrations of purified sfGFP were loaded in glass capilary tubes and imaged under the same illumination conditions used for live-cell imaging experiments. The resulting intensity images were used to construct a standard curve and calculate a calibration constant (i.e., number of sfGFP molecules per camera count) for the system. Using this value, we then estimated the RIα concentration in each fluorescent puncta in each cell based on the measured area and the mean intensity value, assuming spherical puncta.
Cells were imaged using a Nikon A1R HD confocal with a four-line (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm) LUN-V laser engine and DU4 detector using bandpass and long-pass filters for each channel (450/50, 525/50, 595/50 and 700/75) mounted on a Nikon Ti2 using an Apo 100x 1.49 NA objective and operated using NIS Elements software.

For the Zeiss Axiovert 200M, the following excitation/emission filter combinations (center/bandwidth in nm) were used: BFP - EX380/10, EM475/25; CFP - EX420/20, EM475/25; GFP - EX480/30, EM535/45; YFP - EX495/10, EM535/25; RFP - EX568/55, EM653/95; CFP/YFPFRET - EX420/20, EM535/25; GFP/RFPFRET - EX480/30, EM653/95. For the Zeiss AxioObserver Z1, the following excitation/emission filter combinations were used: GFP - EM480/30, EX535/45. All filter sets were alternated using a Lambda 10-2 filter-changer (Sutter Instruments). Exposure times were 50 (for acceptor direct channel) and 500 ms (for all other channels), with the EM gain set to 20 for the AxioObserver Z1 microscope, and images were acquired every 30 s. All epifluorescence experiments were subsequently analyzed using METAFLUOR 7.7 software. DIC images were acquired on the Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. Brightfield images were acquired on an eVos FL cell imaging system (Thermo Fisher).
Raw fluorescence images were corrected by subtracting the background fluorescence intensity of a cell-free region from the emission intensities of biosensor-expressing cells. Green/red, red/green, or cyan/yellow emission ratios were then calculated at each time point ( R) . For some curves, the resulting time courses were normalized by dividing the emission ratio at each time point by the basal ratio value at time zero ( R / R 0 ), which was defined as the emission ratio at the time point immediately preceding drug addition ( R 0 ). Normalized-to-time-zero ratio changes ( R / R 0 ) from drug stimulation (Δ R / R 0 (drug)) were reported for some of the bar graphs and were calculated as ( R drug – R 0 ) /R 0 , where R drug is the emission ratio at the last time point after the corresponding drug addition. For PDE4D2 cat -ICUE4 curves, the resulting time courses were normalized to the maximum ratio change (Δ R /Δ R max ) by calculating ( R – R 0 )/( R max – R 0 ), where R max is the maximum emission ratio value recorded after all stimulations. Graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad).
For analysis of puncta number, cell images were individually thresholded and underwent particle analysis with circularity and size cut-offs in ImageJ.
The circular FRAP regions were saved and the radius ( r ) was calculated from the area. Time-to-half maximum values ( t 1/2 ) were acquired from ImageJ data processing tools. Since the FRAP regions were circular, the apparent diffusivity ( D app ) is calculated from the following equation ( Kang et al., 2012 48. Kang, M. ∙ Day, C.A. ∙ Kenworthy, A.K. ...

Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad). All data were assessed for normality. For normally distributed data, pairwise comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests, with Welch’s correction for unequal variances used as indicated. Comparisons between three or more groups were performed using ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). For data that were not normally distributed, pairwise comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and comparisons between multiple groups were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Average time courses shown in Figures 1 C; 3 B, 3C, 3E, 3G, and 3H (curves); 4 B–4D (curves); 5 E (curves); S1 A; S3 A, S3B, S3D, and S3F (curves); and S4 B, S4D, S4E, and S4H–S4K (curves) are representative of at least 3 independently repeated experiments. Average time courses and bar graphs shown in Figures 1 D; 2 B and 2F; 3 B–3H (bar graphs); 4 B–4D (bar graphs); 5 B–5D, 5E (bar graphs), and 5 F–5H; S1 C–S1E; S2 B–S2H; S3 C, S3D (bar graph), S3 F, and S3G; S4 B (bar graph), S4 F–S4J (bar graphs), and S4 L; and S5 E–S5G combined datasets from at least 3 independent experiments, unless otherwise stated.
Throughout the paper, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001 and ††††p < 0.0001. Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was performed for Figures 2 B ( ∗ versus wild-type RIα and † versus Δ(D/D+linker)), 5 D (†, versus the corresponding DnaJB1-PKA cat + RIα column), S2 B (versus wild-type RIα), and S5 F (versus WT). Unpaired two-tailed Student t tests were performed for Figures 3 D, 3F, 5 E, S3 D, S4 B, S4F, and S4L, and Welch’s correction was applied for Figures 3 B, 3C, 3E, 3G, 3H, 4 B–4D, 5B, and S4 H–S4J. Unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-tests were performed for Figures 5 D ( ∗ , –Fsk versus +Fsk), S2 D, and S2F. Ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was performed for Figures 5 G, 5H, and S5 G (all versus WT) and followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test for Figure S4 G. A one-sample t test versus a hypothetical value of 1 was performed for Figure S5 E.
