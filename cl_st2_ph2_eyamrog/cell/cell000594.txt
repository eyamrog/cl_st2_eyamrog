Title: Quiescent cancer cells resist T cell attack by forming an immunosuppressive niche


Abstract: Summary

Immunotherapy is a promising treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but patients relapse, highlighting the need to understand the mechanisms of resistance. We discovered that in primary breast cancer, tumor cells that resist T cell attack are quiescent. Quiescent cancer cells (QCCs) form clusters with reduced immune infiltration. They also display superior tumorigenic capacity and higher expression of chemotherapy resistance and stemness genes. We adapted single-cell RNA-sequencing with precise spatial resolution to profile infiltrating cells inside and outside the QCC niche. This transcriptomic analysis revealed hypoxia-induced programs and identified more exhausted T cells, tumor-protective fibroblasts, and dysfunctional dendritic cells inside clusters of QCCs. This uncovered differential phenotypes in infiltrating cells based on their intra-tumor location. Thus, QCCs constitute immunotherapy-resistant reservoirs by orchestrating a local hypoxic immune-suppressive milieu that blocks T cell function. Eliminating QCCs holds the promise to counteract immunotherapy resistance and prevent disease recurrence in TNBC.

Section: Introduction

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive form of breast cancer. It lacks expression of hormone receptors and HER2, preventing the use of targeted therapies. Thus, chemotherapy has long been the only systemic therapy for these patients, limiting their options. Recently, two phase III clinical trials found that immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in combination with chemotherapy improved progression-free survival in metastatic PD-L1-positive TNBC, leading to their approval as a first line treatment ( Cortes et al., 2020 10. Cortes, J. ∙ Cescon, D.W. ∙ Rugo, H.S. ...

However, only a fraction of patients benefit from immunotherapy, raising questions about resistance mechanisms.
There is a major ongoing effort to identify the drivers of tumor microenvironment (TME) diversity, which correlates with immunotherapy resistance ( Binnewies et al., 2018 5. Binnewies, M. ∙ Roberts, E.W. ∙ Kersten, K. ... Understanding the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for effective therapy Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :541-550 Crossref Scopus (3362) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cancer cells are known to modulate the TME ( Wellenstein and Visser, 2018 60. Wellenstein, M.D. ∙ Visser, K.E. de. Cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms shaping the tumor immune landscape Immunity. 2018; 48 :399-416 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the mechanisms are poorly understood. CRISPR screens have uncovered cancer-cell intrinsic resistance mechanisms ( Pan et al., 2018 42. Pan, D. ∙ Kobayashi, A. ∙ Jiang, P. ... A major chromatin regulator determines resistance of tumor cells to T cell-mediated killing Science. 2018; 359 :770-775 Crossref Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ; Patel et al., 2017 45. Patel, S.J. ∙ Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Kishton, R.J. ... Identification of essential genes for cancer immunotherapy Nature. 2017; 548 :537-542 Crossref Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ) but cannot describe how cancer cells orchestrate a multicellular immunosuppressive TME. Alternatively, bulk tumor sequencing can identify signatures of ICB resistance but must contend with different populations of cancer cells within the tumor ( Wolf et al., 2019 61. Wolf, Y. ∙ Bartok, O. ∙ Patkar, S. ... UVB-induced tumor heterogeneity diminishes immune response in melanoma Cell. 2019; 179 :219-235.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). Different cancer-cell clones can evolve distinct strategies for immune evasion. Thus, tumor cells that lose the targeted antigen(s) do not need any other means to escape from T cell attack. These intermingled populations can enhance the difficulty of identifying other resistance mechanisms, mostly those involving modulation of the TME.
Here, we investigate resistance to T cell killing in cancer cells that unequivocally express the targeted antigen by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a visible tumor neo-antigen and exploiting our GFP-specific CD8+ Jedi T cells ( Agudo et al., 2015 2. Agudo, J. ∙ Ruzo, A. ∙ Park, E.S. ... GFP-specific CD8 T cells enable targeted cell depletion and visualization of T-cell interactions Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :1287-1292 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that antigen-expressing (GFP+) but T cell-resistant cancer cells were principally quiescent cancer cells (QCCs). These cells formed clusters with reduced immune infiltration and demonstrated a higher tumorigenic potential. We adapted a technique involving photo-labeling, FACS-sorting, and scRNA-seq ( Medaglia et al., 2017 34. Medaglia, C. ∙ Giladi, A. ∙ Stoler-Barak, L. ... Spatial reconstruction of immune niches by combining photoactivatable reporters and scRNA-seq Science. 2017; 358 :1622-1626 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ) to a tumor setting, which we named photo-conversion of areas to dissect micro-environments (PADME-seq). PADME-seq was used to profile infiltrates inside these QCC clusters and, in parallel, other regions from the same tumor mass. We uncovered that QCCs form a niche containing immune-suppressive fibroblasts, dysfunctional dendritic cells, and highly exhausted T cells. Such ecosystems were orchestrated by QCCs through activation of a hypoxia-induced program.

Section: Results

To investigate how tumor cells that retain expression of targeted antigen(s) can escape T cell killing, we used anti-GFP-specific Jedi T cells ( Agudo et al., 2015 2. Agudo, J. ∙ Ruzo, A. ∙ Park, E.S. ... GFP-specific CD8 T cells enable targeted cell depletion and visualization of T-cell interactions Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :1287-1292 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) in combination with GFP-expressing TNBC 4T07 cells. GFP as a visible tumor antigen allows one to distinguish cells that survive T cell attack and retain antigen expression. We orthotopically injected a mix of GFP+ and mCherry+ cells in mice. Since Jedi T cells do not recognize mCherry, mCherry+ cells constituted labeled controls that were embedded within the same milieu ( Figure 1 A). We generated PD1-deficient Jedi T cells (PD1−/− Jedi) by crossing with PD1−/− mice ( Keir et al., 2007 24. Keir, M.E. ∙ Freeman, G.J. ∙ Sharpe, A.H. PD-1 regulates self-reactive CD8 + T cell responses to antigen in lymph nodes and tissues J. Immunol. 2007; 179 :5064-5070 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ); so, PD1 inactivation was directed only against GFP+ cells. PD1−/− Jedi T cells were transferred at either day 7 or day 15, to capture different stages of tumor growth ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). PD1−/− Jedi T cells effectively killed most but not all GFP+ cancer cells ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 B). Surviving GFP+ cancer cells formed clusters ( Figure 1 D) with two-fold reduced T cell infiltration compared with mCherry+ regions, indicating partial T cell exclusion ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 C–S1E). This result demonstrates that mammary carcinomas contain regions with restricted T cell infiltration likely contributing to their resistance to immunotherapy.
We FACS-sorted GFP+ surviving antigen-expressing cancer cells along with control mCherry+ cells to perform RNA-sequencing. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that GFP+ and mCherry+ cells from the same tumors did not cluster together. Instead GFP+ samples from the various tumors were closer to each other than to mCherry+ cells from the corresponding tumor ( Figures 1 G, S1 F, and S1G). This provided a good framework to search for differentially expressed genes between GFP+ and mCherry+ cells to uncover mechanisms of resistance to T cell killing. Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHCI) has been reported to decrease in resistant pancreatic tumor cells ( Pommier et al., 2018 46. Pommier, A. ∙ Anaparthy, N. ∙ Memos, N. ... Unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress engenders immune-resistant, latent pancreatic cancer metastases Science. 2018; 360 :1-15 Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar ), but we found no reduction in antigen presentation pathway genes ( Figure S1 H) or MHCI protein expression ( Figures 1 H and S1 I). Instead, we found that genes related to resistance to chemotherapy, tumor initiation, and hypoxia were upregulated, such as Ngfr , Aldh1a1 , and Car9 ( Lee et al., 2017 25. Lee, K.-M. ∙ Giltnane, J.M. ∙ Balko, J.M. ...

Nerve growth factor receptor increases the tumor growth and metastatic potential of triple-negative breast cancer cells Oncogene. 2021; 40 :2165-2181 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S1 J and S1K).
The most significant gene ontology pathways that differed between GFP+ and mCherry+ cells were all related to cell cycle ( Figures 1 I and S1 L). Key genes involved in proliferation and DNA replication, such as Mki67 and Pcna , were all downregulated ( Figures S1 M and S1N). To confirm whether these resistant cells were in cell-cycle arrest, we treated tumor-bearing mice with the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) daily, starting before adoptive transfer of PD1−/− Jedi T cells. Six days post-Jedi treatment, most mCherry+ cancer cells were positive for EdU. Conversely, the EdU signal was low in T cell-resistant GFP+ tumor cells. This demonstrated that most T cell-resistant GFP+ cancer cells were not cycling prior to adoptive T cell transfer and did not cycle during T cell killing ( Figures 1 J and 1K). Therefore, cancer cells that escaped attack by CD8+ T cells formed distinct clusters of QCCs.
To understand QCC resistance to T cell killing, we set up an approach to isolate and profile live non-cycling cancer cells. We used a published quiescence reporter ( Oki et al., 2014 39. Oki, T. ∙ Nishimura, K. ∙ Kitaura, J. ... A novel cell-cycle-indicator, mVenus-p27K -, identifies quiescent cells and visualizes G0-G1 transition Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :4012 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), consisting of mVenus fused to an inactive p27-CDK binding domain (mVenus-p27K). We validated this mVenus-p27K reporter in 4T07 tumors and observed that all mVenus-p27K High cells were negative for Ki67 ( Figures S1 O and S1P). mVenus-p27K High cells also remained EdU-negative after 5 days of EdU treatment in vivo ( Figures 1 L and S1 Q). These findings are consistent with previous studies reporting the existence of p27+ quiescent tumor cells in primary breast cancer ( Fluegen et al., 2017 15. Fluegen, G. ∙ Avivar-Valderas, A. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Phenotypic heterogeneity of disseminated tumour cells is preset by primary tumour hypoxic microenvironments Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19 :120-132 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). mVenus-p27K High cells were also observed in 4T07 tumors in immune-deficient NOS scid IL2Rgamma (NSG) mice ( Figure S1 R), demonstrating that these QCCs arise independently of T cells.
Next, we replaced mVenus with the red fluorescent protein tdTomato to prevent spectral overlap with GFP and then engineered 4T07 cells to express either GFP as an antigen or miRFP670 (far red) as a non-immunogenic control label. Mice with tumors that were mix of GFP:miRFP670 cells and carrying the tdTomato-p27K reporter received adoptive transfer of PD1−/− Jedi T cells. Surviving GFP+ cells had a 2-fold increase in tdTomato-p27K High cells compared with miRFP670+ cells ( Figures 1 M, 1N, and S1 S). We repeated this experiment using a higher number of PD1−/− Jedi T cells to enable more stringent killing ( Figure S1 S). In this setting, the few resistant GFP+ cells were almost all quiescent ( Figures 1 M and 1N). Taken together, this suggests that intra-tumor QCCs are more resistant to T cell killing than actively cycling cancer cells.
Next, we assessed whether p27K High cells were enriched upon T cell killing or, conversely, surviving GFP+ cells became quiescent during T cell attack. We built a genetic circuit where doxycycline induces H2B-tdTomato only in p27K+ cells ( Figure 1 O). p27K+ tumor cells were labeled by one doxycycline injection. The next day, after drug clearance, Jedi T cells were adoptively transferred. Around 65% of the surviving GFP+ cells were tdTomato+, while only ∼20% of the cells were tdTomato+ in tumors from NSG mice (with no T cell pressure) ( Figure 1 P). This indicates that most surviving GFP+ tumor cells after Jedi treatment were already p27K High prior to adoptive transfer of Jedi cells.
Since interferons can induce quiescence in disseminated tumor cells ( Correia et al., 2021 9. Correia, A.L. ∙ Guimaraes, J.C. ∙ Auf der Maur, P. ... Hepatic stellate cells suppress NK cell-sustained breast cancer dormancy Nature. 2021; 594 :566-571 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the top upregulated pathway in surviving GFP+ cells after T cell attack was “IFN-beta signaling” ( Figure 1 I), we generated knockout cells for the IFNB receptor Ifnar1 ( Figure S1 T). GFP+ Ifnar1−/− cancer cells were killed by Jedi T cells in a similar rate to their WT counterparts ( Figures 1 Q and S1 U). Among the surviving cells, there was also a similar ratio of p27K High cells compared with WT GFP+ cells ( Figure 1 Q), suggesting that IFNB was not critical for the quiescent phenotype observed in surviving cells.
Since QCCs did not proliferate for multiple days, we questioned whether these resistant cells could re-start a growth program after T cell therapy. We first tested the ability of surviving GFP+ cells to regrow tumors compared with that of bulk GFP cells. Jedi T cell-resistant GFP+ cells were able to regrow tumors more efficiently than non-selected GFP+ tumor cells ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Next, we investigated the ability of p27K High cells from untreated tumors to re-enter into cell cycle. First, we investigated the existence of p27K High QCCs in other models of TNBC: EMT6 and D2A1. In these models, mVenus-p27K High cells also formed clusters and did not proliferate for several days ( Figures S2 C and S2D). Once the presence of QCCs in multiple TNBC models was confirmed, we addressed whether their quiescent state was terminal. We FACS-sorted live mCherry+ mVenus-p27K High (QCCs) and mCherry+ mVenus-p27K Neg proliferative counterparts from these models and injected them in new mice ( Figure 2 A). In all cases, mVenus-p27K High cells re-grew tumors, proving that they were not in a terminal state of quiescence. Remarkably, QCCs displayed a higher tumor initiation potential at these limiting numbers than mVenus-p27K Neg cells ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Thus, QCCs were not only able to re-enter the cell cycle and initiate tumor growth but did so more effectively than their proliferating counterparts.
We performed immuno-staining of CD3 in untreated mVenus-p27K-expressing 4T07, EMT6, and D2A1 tumors ( Figure 2 D). Although T cells were found inside the clusters of QCCs, their numbers were always lower in these regions ( Figures 2 E and S2 E–S2G). Staining for CD4 and CD8 confirmed that both types of T cells were reduced inside the clusters of QCCs ( Figures 2 F, S2 H, and S2I). Further analysis with anti-CD45 staining revealed that regions with QCCs had poor immune infiltration compared with cycling areas ( Figure 2 G). These results demonstrated that QCCs reside in a niche with reduced numbers of infiltrating immune cells.
To dissect the relationship between QCCs and T cells in patients, we analyzed p27, Ki67, CD3, and E-cadherin on tumor tissue ( Figure 2 H). We measured the number of Ki67+ (proliferative) or p27+ (quiescent) tumor cells in contact with T cells in cancer biopsies from 10 de-identified treatment naive patients. This uncovered that Ki67+ cells were more frequently found in the vicinity of T cells than p27+ cancer cells ( Figures 2 I and S2 J). Next, we investigated whether the abundance of quiescent versus proliferative cells in human TNBC could influence the response to ICB. We utilized bulk RNA-seq datasets from pre-treatment biopsies in a cohort of 29 patients with metastatic TNBC that were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (B.-S.R., J.F., K. Collie, et al., unpublished data). In this cohort, 5 patients presented with primary resistance to ICB; we defined them as non-responders. Among the 24 patients with benefit, 5 patients experienced a durable response (durable responders; progression-free survival ranging from 26 to 60 months) ( Figure 2 J). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of these data comparing durable responders and non-responders showed “reactome E2F regulation of DNA replication” as the number one most enriched pathway ( Figure 2 K), suggesting that tumor proliferation may correlate with response to ICB. This result agreed with recent reports comparing chemotherapy+ICB to chemotherapy alone. RNA-seq analysis of >800 patients in a multi-center clinical trial revealed “cell proliferation” as a top pathway enriched in responders in the ICB arm ( Emens et al., 2021 14. Emens, L.A. ∙ Goldstein, L.D. ∙ Schmid, P. ... The tumor microenvironment (TME) and atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel (A+nP) activity in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC): IMpassion130 J. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 39 :1006 Crossref Google Scholar ). Although it is only an association, these data suggest that TNBC with abundant proliferative tumor cells could have a better response to ICB, while QCCs could lead to resistance.
To investigate mechanisms of resistance in QCCs, we FACS-sorted live QCCs (mVenus-p27K High ) and non-quiescent (mVenus-p27K Neg ) tumor cells from 4T07, EMT6, and D2A1 tumors for RNA-seq. Unbiased gene ontology (GO) analysis from differentially expressed genes ( Figure S3 A) showed that the most downregulated genes in QCCs were involved in cell cycle, confirming their quiescent nature ( Figure S3 B). Among the most upregulated genes in QCCs, we identified genes linked to chemoresistance: Car9 ( Lu et al., 2017 28. Lu, H. ∙ Chen, I. ∙ Shimoda, L.A. ... Chemotherapy-induced Ca 2+ release stimulates breast cancer stem cell enrichment Cell Rep. 2017; 18 :1946-1957 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), Kdm5a , and Kdm5b ( Hinohara et al., 2018 19. Hinohara, K. ∙ Wu, H.J. ∙ Vigneau, S. ... KDM5 histone demethylase activity links cellular transcriptomic heterogeneity to therapeutic resistance Cancer Cell. 2018; 34 :939-953.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ); and related to stemness: Runx1 , Klf4 , Sox4 , and Sox9 ( Oskarsson et al., 2014 40. Oskarsson, T. ∙ Batlle, E. ∙ Massagué, J.

Cancer stem cells: the architects of the tumor ecosystem Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 24 :41-53 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A). The top upregulated pathways in QCCs across the 3 models were hypoxia-related (e.g., angiogenesis) and glucose metabolism-related ( Figures 3 B, 3C, S3 C, and S3D). To test whether these QCCs were indeed in a hypoxic niche, we visualized pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe) along with CD3 in mVenus-p27K-expressing tumors. Pimonidazole+ regions partially co-localized with clusters of QCCs and inversely correlated with T cell-rich regions ( Figures 3 D and 3E). Accordingly, areas of surviving GFP+ cancer cells after Jedi T cell attack also showed augmented pimonidazole signal ( Figure 3 F). This suggested that the hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) signature observed in the RNA-seq data was the result of local hypoxia. HIF1A activation leads to expression of glycolytic genes such as the glucose transporter Slc2a1 or Glut1 . QCCs showed a >2-fold increase in uptake of 2-NBDG, demonstrating that these cells were more glycolytic than their proliferative counterparts, a feature that had been described in tumor-initiating cells ( Paolicchi et al., 2016 43. Paolicchi, E. ∙ Gemignani, F. ∙ Krstic-Demonacos, M. ...

Hypoxia-inducible factors: coupling glucose metabolism and redox regulation with induction of the breast cancer stem cell phenotype EMBO J. 2017; 36 :252-259 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 G). Hence, QCCs in breast cancer reside in hypoxic micro-niches and display an enhanced glycolytic phenotype as reported by others ( Fluegen et al., 2017 15. Fluegen, G. ∙ Avivar-Valderas, A. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Phenotypic heterogeneity of disseminated tumour cells is preset by primary tumour hypoxic microenvironments Nat.

To uncover how QCCs limited T cell function at single-cell resolution, we adapted a protocol for isolation of cells from specific tissue areas for scRNA-seq ( Medaglia et al., 2017 34. Medaglia, C. ∙ Giladi, A. ∙ Stoler-Barak, L. ... Spatial reconstruction of immune niches by combining photoactivatable reporters and scRNA-seq Science. 2017; 358 :1622-1626 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ) to our tumor setting. We used transgenic mice expressing the photo-convertible protein Kaede to grow tdTomato-p27K-expressing tumors and generated consecutive slices of live tumor ( Figures 4 A and 4B). This approach, which we named photo-conversion of areas to dissect micro-environments (PADME-seq), allowed us to profile infiltrating cells from distinct sub-regions within the same tumor mass (inside and outside clusters of QCCs). We performed two separate experiments in which we FACS-sorted equivalent numbers of live photo-converted cells from each region. After discarding doublets and cells with low mRNA quality, we had 1,743 and 975 cells from inside the areas of QCCs for each experiment respectively, and 1,968 and 2,259 in non-QCC regions. All major tumor infiltrating cell types (macrophages, fibroblasts, T cells, dendritic cells, NK cells, and neutrophils) were present both inside and outside regions of QCCs ( Figures 4 C and S4 A–S4C). Since immunofluorescence analysis had shown that immune infiltrates ( Figure 2 G) were reduced in QCC regions, we first investigated whether fibroblasts were phenotypically different. Unsupervised GSEA comparing fibroblasts from p27K High versus p27K Neg areas revealed that immune-related defense pathways were downregulated in the QCC niche ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Conversely, collagen-deposition pathways were upregulated ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Notably, we compared our data with a previously published fibroblast signature identified in ICB-resistant patients ( Dominguez et al., 2020 13. Dominguez, C.X. ∙ Müller, S. ∙ Keerthivasan, S. ... Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals stromal evolution into LRRC15+ myofibroblasts as a determinant of patient response to cancer immunotherapy Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :232-253 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ) and confirmed a suppressive fibroblast phenotype inside the QCC niche ( Figure S4 D).
Although immune infiltration was lower in areas of QCCs, some T cells were able to enter. To understand why these T cells could not kill QCCs, we analyzed gene expression profiles of T cells inside and outside QCC areas. First, to elucidate the heterogeneity in T cell subsets, we reclustered the Cd3+ T cell cluster ( Figures 4 F and S4 E). This revealed one subset of γδT cells, one of CD4+ T cells, and five of CD8+ T cells. One CD8+ T cell subset displayed high expression of myeloid-specific genes such as Lyz2 and was not included in further analysis ( Figure S4 E). We performed GSEA of the remaining CD8+ subsets comparing cells inside p27K High regions with cells outside. This revealed downregulation of multiple immune functions and signaling pathways in CD8+ T cells inside the QCC niche ( Figure 4 G). Additionally, we constructed a co-expression network, which showed downregulation of genes related to T cell activation in CD8+ T cells inside QCC areas ( Figures S4 F and S4G). Taken together, these analyses suggest that CD8+ T cells in the QCC niche are more dysfunctional and less fit for anti-tumor immunity.
Further, we classified the 4 identified sub-populations of CD8+ T cells using previous literature ( Beltra et al., 2020 4. Beltra, J.C. ∙ Manne, S. ∙ Abdel-Hakeem, M.S. ... Developmental relationships of four exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets reveals underlying transcriptional and epigenetic landscape control mechanisms Immunity. 2020; 52 :825-841.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (486) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miller et al., 2019 36. Miller, B.C. ∙ Sen, D.R. ∙ Al Abosy, R. ... Subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells differentially mediate tumor control and respond to checkpoint blockade Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :326-336 Crossref Scopus (1088) PubMed Google Scholar ) as: terminally exhausted ( Prf1 , Havcr2 , Gzmb , and Il2rb ), intermediate exhausted ( Tnfrsf4 , Lag3 , Ifng , Ccl3 , Tnfrsf9 , and Csf1 ), proliferative ( mKi67 and Cdk1 ), and progenitor exhausted ( Cd28 , Cxcr3 , Ifit1 , and Stat1 ) ( Figures 4 F, S4 E, and S4H). The percentage of terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells was higher inside the QCC niche, whereas proliferative CD8+ T cells were more frequent outside the QCC niche ( Figure 4 H). Terminally exhausted T cells displayed the highest expression of Havcr2 (TIM3+) ( Figure S4 H), a hallmark of the most dysfunctional T cells ( Sakuishi et al., 2010 48. Sakuishi, K. ∙ Apetoh, L. ∙ Sullivan, J.M. ... Targeting Tim-3 and PD-1 pathways to reverse T cell exhaustion and restore anti-tumor immunity J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207 :2187-2194 Crossref Scopus (1545) PubMed Google Scholar ; Singer et al., 2016 54. Singer, M. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Cong, L. ... A distinct gene module for dysfunction uncoupled from activation in tumor-infiltrating T cells Cell. 2016; 166 :1500-1511.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, to validate this T cell exhaustion signature inside the QCC niche, we quantified PD1+ TIM3+ CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry using the same photo-labeling system ( Figure 4 I). Additionally, we used CODEX (Akoya) for multiplexed immunofluorescence to quantify exhausted T cells with respect to p27+ cells ( Figures 4 J, 4K, and S4 I). Both approaches confirmed that less exhausted TIM3− CD8+ T cells were more abundant in proliferative tumor areas ( Figures 4 I–4K and S4 I). CODEX analysis also confirmed a significant reduction in overall immune infiltration inside the QCC nice ( Figure S4 J). Furthermore, we used CODEX to characterize T cell exhaustion in GFP-expressing tumors upon treatment with Jedi T cells. This confirmed that the small clusters of surviving GFP+ cancer cells after Jedi attack (described in Figure 1 ) displayed lower T cell infiltration ( Figure S4 K) and these few T cells were more exhausted ( Figures 4 L–4N). Thus, all these data demonstrated that the QCC niche was less infiltrated, with more exhausted T cells.
To uncover the immune populations that could contribute to T cell dysfunction in response to local hypoxia, we quantified a hypoxic signature comparing cells inside and outside QCC regions. All subsets of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) showed an enrichment in hypoxia-induced genes: DC1 (identified by Clec9a , Xcr1 , and Wdfy4 ), DC2 ( Itgax , Sirpa , and Cd209a ), and mregDCs ( Ccr7 , Cd80 , Cd200 , and Cd247 ) ( Maier et al., 2020 30.

A conserved dendritic-cell regulatory program limits antitumour immunity Nature. 2020; 580 :257-262 Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 A, S5 A, and S5B). Unsupervised GSEA of all cDCs showed a downregulation of innate immunity and immune-response pathways inside the QCC niche ( Figure 5 B). DC2s displayed a similar result, presenting a highly immune-dysfunctional state ( Figures 5 C and S5 C). Key IFN-induced genes and other important genes for DC function were reduced in DC2 located in the QCC niche ( Figure 5 D). We then focused on mregDCs, which are DCs that have taken up tumor antigen, being key for anti-tumor immunity ( Maier et al., 2020 30. Maier, B. ∙ Leader, A.M. ∙ Chen, S.T. ... A conserved dendritic-cell regulatory program limits antitumour immunity Nature. 2020; 580 :257-262 Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since this is a newly identified subset, we analyzed expression of functionally relevant genes based on the literature ( Figure 5 E). mregDCs in the QCC niche displayed lower expression of MHCI and MHCII-related genes, suggesting a diminished ability to present antigen. They also displayed lower expression of Cd81 and Il12a and Il12b , a key cytokine for T cell responses ( Garris et al., 2018 16. Garris, C.S. ∙ Arlauckas, S.P. ∙ Kohler, R.H. ... Successful anti-PD-1 cancer immunotherapy requires T cell-dendritic cell crosstalk involving the cytokines IFN-γ and IL-12 Immunity. 2018; 49 :1148-1161.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (629) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, mregDCs in the QCC niche had lower expression of Fscn1 (Fascin1), which is expressed in migratory DCs ( Miller et al., 2012 37. Miller, J.C. ∙ Brown, B.D. ∙ Shay, T. ... Deciphering the transcriptional network of the dendritic cell lineage Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :888-899 Crossref Scopus (616) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a reduced capacity to migrate to lymph nodes.
To validate our findings about cDCs from PADME-seq at the protein level, we quantified MHCII in DCs by both conventional immunofluorescence and CODEX. In all settings, DCs displayed lower MHCII when they were located inside areas of surviving GFP+ tumor cells or inside clusters of QCCs in untreated mice ( Figures 5 F–5J). Therefore, DCs within the QCC niche displayed a phenotype consistent with an impaired ability to recruit and activate T cells. Next, we investigated whether dysfunction in DCs was the direct effect of hypoxia by exposing bone marrow-derived DCs ( Agudo et al., 2014 3. Agudo, J. ∙ Ruzo, A. ∙ Tung, N. ... The miR-126–VEGFR2 axis controls the innate response to pathogen-associated nucleic acids Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :54-62 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) to low oxygen levels. Steady-state DCs did not display any difference in key functional markers during hypoxia ( Figure S5 D). Upon treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyI:C, all DCs similarly became activated and upregulated MHCII, CD86, and CD40 regardless of oxygen concentrations. Thus, low oxygen had no effect on the ability of DCs to respond to danger signals ( Figure S5 D).
We assessed whether the immune-suppressive niche orchestrated by QCCs was the result of HIF1a activation in tumor cells by engineering 4T07 cells to express a constitutively active HIF1a (HIF1a STBL ) ( Hu et al., 2007 20. Hu, C.J. ∙ Sataur, A. ∙ Wang, L. ... The N-terminal transactivation domain confers target gene specificity of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18 :4528-4542 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). HIF1a STBL -expressing cells grew slower in vitro ( Figure S6 A) but upon in vivo injection, breast carcinomas showed no statistical differences in weight compared with WT ( Figure S6 B). HIF1a STBL led to a reduced infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and specifically of less exhausted TIM3− T cells ( Figures 6 A–6C). Moreover, MHCII was lower in DCs ( Figures 6 D and 6E), similar to the phenotypes observed inside clusters of QCCs. To investigate whether these alterations could cause resistance to T cell immunity, we generated breast tumors from Cherry+ 4T07 cells mixed with either GFP+ wild-type or GFP+ HIF1a STBL cells ( Figure 6 F). Although only a fraction of cancer cells had HIF1a STBL , DCs showed a trend to lower MHCII levels ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Moreover, mixed mCherry with GFP-HIF1a STBL -expressing tumors showed a ∼50% reduction in CD8+ T cell infiltration and the infiltrating T cells were mostly excluded from GFP+ regions ( Figures 6 G and 6H). Upon adoptive transfer of Jedi T cells, WT tumors showed <6% of surviving GFP+ cells, demonstrating efficient killing. Conversely, ∼26% of GFP+ HIF1a STBL cells survived, constituting a 4-fold increase ( Figures 6 I and 6J). To investigate the therapeutic benefit of HIF1a modulation in cancer cells, we generated Hif1a knockout GFP+ 4T07 cells ( Figure S6 E). Mice with either WT GFP+ or Hif1a−/− GFP+ tumors were treated with Jedi T cells. This led to a larger reduction in size in Hif1a−/− tumors compared with WT ( Figure 6 K). Both endogenous CD8+ T cells and transferred CD45.1+ Jedi T cells displayed increased numbers and reduced exhaustion in Hif1a−/− tumors ( Figures 6 L–6N). These results suggest that HIF1a activation in cancer cells restricts T cell infiltration and increases T cell exhaustion, possibly through forcing DCs into a less activated phenotype ( Figure 6 O). Our data, together with previous reports correlating HIF1a to chemotherapy resistance ( Lu et al., 2017 28. Lu, H. ∙ Chen, I. ∙ Shimoda, L.A. ... Chemotherapy-induced Ca 2+ release stimulates breast cancer stem cell enrichment Cell Rep. 2017; 18 :1946-1957 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggest that HIF1a activation in tumor cells induces a multi-resistant phenotype. Thus, our work has identified a crucial cancer population that orchestrates an immune-suppressive TME and must be eliminated for treatment success.

Section: Discussion

The abundance and types of immune infiltration correlate with response to ICB. Understanding how the location and phenotype of infiltrating cells are determined remains an outstanding question in cancer research. Here, we found that QCCs formed micro-territories with lower immune infiltration, uncovering a hidden driver of immune exclusion. Using PADME-seq, we discovered that QCCs survived during adoptive T cell therapy through orchestration of a local hypoxic and immune-suppressive milieu that led to augmented T cell exhaustion.
Since most cancer studies focus on mechanisms controlling tumor growth, quiescence in the tumor mass has been less studied, with some exceptions ( Fluegen et al., 2017 15. Fluegen, G. ∙ Avivar-Valderas, A. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Phenotypic heterogeneity of disseminated tumour cells is preset by primary tumour hypoxic microenvironments Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19 :120-132 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pascual et al., 2017 44. Pascual, G. ∙ Avgustinova, A. ∙ Mejetta, S. ... Targeting metastasis-initiating cells through the fatty acid receptor CD36 Nature. 2017; 541 :41-45 Crossref Scopus (948) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, we did not identify QCCs in TNBC by studying heterogeneity in cell cycle, but in an unbiased manner by isolating tumor cells that had resisted T cell attack. This intra-tumor quiescent phenotype is different from the process known as cellular tumor dormancy, which occurs in disseminated tumor cells ( Ghajar, 2015 17. Ghajar, C.M. Metastasis prevention by targeting the dormant niche Nat. Publ. Gr. 2015; 15 :238-247 Google Scholar ; Sosa et al., 2014 55. Sosa, M.S. ∙ Bragado, P. ∙ Aguirre-Ghiso, J.A. Mechanisms of disseminated cancer cell dormancy: an awakening field Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2014; 14 :611-622 Crossref Scopus (822) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, QCCs displayed enhanced tumor initiation potential upon isolation and re-injection, demonstrating their potential for disease recurrence. Importantly, reports from the IMpassion130 trial analyzing RNA-seq data from >800 TNBC patients revealed “proliferation” as a feature that correlated with response to ICB. Conversely, “angiogenesis” (a hypoxia-induced pathway that we observed in QCCs) was associated with resistance to ICB ( Emens et al., 2021 14. Emens, L.A. ∙ Goldstein, L.D. ∙ Schmid, P. ... The tumor microenvironment (TME) and atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel (A+nP) activity in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC): IMpassion130 J. Clin. Oncol. 2021; 39 :1006 Crossref Google Scholar ). Thus, a metabolically distinct cancer sub-population of quiescent cells comprises the fittest to survive upon T cell attack, becoming reservoirs of resistance (and probably recurrence) during ICB treatment in TNBC.
One of the strongest mechanisms to escape from T cell killing is by downregulation of antigen presentation ( Patel et al., 2017 45. Patel, S.J. ∙ Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Kishton, R.J. ... Identification of essential genes for cancer immunotherapy Nature. 2017; 548 :537-542 Crossref Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, disseminated pancreatic cancer cells survive during anti-tumor T cell responses by losing MHCI protein ( Pommier et al., 2018 46. Pommier, A. ∙ Anaparthy, N. ∙ Memos, N. ... Unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress engenders immune-resistant, latent pancreatic cancer metastases Science. 2018; 360 :1-15 Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar ), while quiescent stem cells decrease MHCI both at the RNA and protein level ( Agudo et al., 2018 1. Agudo, J. ∙ Park, E.S. ∙ Rose, S.A. ... Quiescent tissue stem cells evade immune surveillance Immunity. 2018; 48 :271-285.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, the quiescence program in primary breast tumors that we uncovered here did not reduce MHCI, illustrating an orthogonal mechanism to previously published means of T cell immune evasion.
Our PADME-seq method exposed that while terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells were more abundant inside the QCC niche, proliferating CD8+ T cells were more likely found outside these niches. Similarly, the percentage of PD1+ TIM3+ CD3+ T cells was greater inside clusters of QCCs. The underlying mechanism/s inducing this exhausted phenotype along with their location within the tumor mass had not been reported. Here we described the spatial distribution of these dysfunctional TIM3+ CD3+ T cells, identifying them near QCCs. We also found that HIF1a activation in tumor cells was sufficient to increase the numbers of these more exhausted T cells. Remarkably, genetic activation of HIF1a in T cells had been shown to improve their ability to eliminate tumors. Conversely, HIF1a loss in T cells had been demonstrated to impair anti-tumor T cell immunity ( Doedens et al., 2013 12. Doedens, A.L. ∙ Phan, A.T. ∙ Stradner, M.H. ... Hypoxia-inducible factors enhance the effector responses of CD8+ T cells to persistent antigen Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :1173-1182 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ; Palazon et al., 2017 41. Palazon, A. ∙ Tyrakis, P.A. ∙ Macias, D. ... An HIF-1α/VEGF-A axis in cytotoxic T cells regulates tumor progression Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :669-683.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, these published data suggest that abrogated T cell function in regions of QQCs is not the result of HIF1a activation in T cells. Instead, we uncovered a circuit by which cancer metabolism altered T cells in an indirect manner through induction of suppressive fibroblasts and DCs. This finding can explain the incongruency of the previously reported beneficial role of HIF1a activation in T cells from the overall detrimental effect of hypoxia on response to immunotherapy ( Jayaprakash et al., 2018 23. Jayaprakash, P. ∙ Ai, M. ∙ Liu, A. ... Targeted hypoxia reduction restores T cell infiltration and sensitizes prostate cancer to immunotherapy J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :5137-5149 Crossref Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scharping et al., 2017 49. Scharping, N.E. ∙ Menk, A.V. ∙ Whetstone, R.D. ... Efficacy of PD-1 blockade is potentiated by metformin-induced reduction of tumor hypoxia Cancer Immunol. Res. 2017; 5 :9-16 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In summary, our work discovered that primary TNBC contained a population of QCCs with the ability to resist T cell attack. These QCCs, through activation of HIF1a, orchestrated a micro-niche with unfit DCs, suppressive fibroblasts, reduced T cell infiltration, and enhanced T cell exhaustion. The development of strategies to overcome immune suppression around QCCs and eradicate these cells will be key to improving responses to immunotherapy in TNBC and preventing recurrence after these treatments.
In this study, we identified quiescence as the top feature of tumor cells that escape from T cell killing in primary breast cancer. We showed that these surviving cancer cells were already in a p27+ quiescent state prior to T cell adoptive transfer. However, the transcriptomes of surviving GFP+ cancer cells from Jedi-treated mice and p27K High cancer cells from untreated animals did not show a clear overlap, mostly due to an increase in IFN and inflammatory signatures in GFP+ cells in response to strong Jedi cell killing. This makes it difficult to determine the correspondence between both quiescent populations, and we cannot exclude that they may be heterogeneous. Moreover, QCCs were not terminally arrested but instead showed a higher tumor-initiating potential than their proliferative counterparts. We did not uncover whether this enhanced potential was the result of an inherent resistance to cell death, their immune evasion properties, or higher stemness potential. Additional studies will be necessary to deepen into this feature of QCCs.
Furthermore, we observed a clear hypoxia signature in the QCC niche and demonstrated that HIF1a activation in tumor cells was sufficient to recapitulate the immune evasion mechanisms found in the QCCs’ microenvironment. Nevertheless, we did not specifically identify a direct molecular link between HIF1a+ cancer cells and downstream impaired responses in DCs and T cells. Lack of oxygen did not alter DC function, but deprivation of nutrients along with unknown secreted factors by QCCs could be the underlying mechanisms. Uncovering the complex crosstalk between QCCs and the diverse immune and stromal components of the TME will require further investigations.

These Jedi mice were bred with PD1 -/- mice (B6.Cg-Pdcd1tm1.1Shr/J, Stock No. 028276, from Jackson Labs) to generate PD1 -/- Jedi, ensuring the H2-Kd haplotype and CD45.1 congenital marker were also selected. F1 from BALB/cJ crossed with C57BL/6J mice (Stock No. 000664 from Jackson Labs) were used for tumor implantation in experiments using PD1 -/- Jedi T cells adoptive transfer. Kaede mice were previously reported ( Tomura et al., 2008 58. Tomura, M. ∙ Yoshida, N. ∙ Tanaka, J. ...

Kaede mice were crossed with BALB/cJ one generation for injection of 4T07 breast cancer cells for tumor formation. All animal procedures were approved by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IACUC and the Harvard Medical School IACUC and performed according to DFCI protocol #17-017 and HMS protocol # IS00002540. The study is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations regarding animal research.
4T07 and D2A1 breast cancer cell lines were a gift from Dr. Robert Weinberg. EMT6 breast cancer cells were purchased from ATCC. HEK293T cells were purchased from Takara. All cell lines were cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), 10% heat inactivated FBS (Gibco), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco) and 1% Glutamax (Gibco). 4T07, EMT6 and D2A1 cells were engineered to express the desired fluorescent proteins and markers by stable transduction with lentiviral vectors (LV). All cells were tested for mycoplasma prior to injection.
GFP and mCherry-expressing 4T07 cells used in Figure 1 were subjected to RNA-sequencing analysis to ensure no bias had occurred during generation of the cell lines. This analysis revealed no differences between the cell lines.
This study was performed in accordance with the guidelines of ethical regulation for human samples under approved protocols 11-104 and 93-085 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute.
Sections from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded Primary Triple Negative Breast Cancer from treatment naïve unidentified patients were obtained from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Pathology core.
Bulk RNAseq data cohort was formed by 29 patients with confirmed mTNBC defined as <1% progesterone receptor, <1% estrogen receptor and HER2 negative by ASCO/CAP guidelines on a metastatic biopsy. Patient regimens: treated with an ICB alone (pembrolizumab, n = 6, NCT02447003; atezolizumab, n = 4, NCT01375842) or as part of a combination regimen with chemotherapy (pembrolizumab + eribulin, n = 8, NCT02513472; atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel, n = 5, NCT0163970) or a targeted therapy (nivolumab + cabozantinib, n = 6, NCT03316586). Samples were sequenced before ICB treatment. PFS was defined as the date of starting immunotherapy to the date of progression, death, or last follow-up. Durable responders were considered as free of disease progression at time of analysis (5 patients) with a PFS of 26-60 months.
Third generation lentiviral packaging and lentiviral vector (LV) backbone with eGFP expression under PGK promoter were a gift from Dr. Brian Brown ( Brown et al., 2006 8. Brown, B.D. ∙ Venneri, M.A. ∙ Zingale, A. ... Endogenous microRNA regulation suppresses transgene expression in hematopoietic lineages and enables stable gene transfer Nat. Med. 2006; 12 :585-591 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mVenus-p27K insert sequence was a gift from Dr. Kitamura ( Oki et al., 2014 39. Oki, T. ∙ Nishimura, K. ∙ Kitaura, J. ... A novel cell-cycle-indicator, mVenus-p27K -, identifies quiescent cells and visualizes G0-G1 transition Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :4012 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fluorescent protein sequences were obtained from the following vectors: mCherry (Dr. Brian Brown gift), H2B-mCherry (Addgene #51007) and H2B-tdTomato (Addgene #58101). The eGFP lentiviral plasmid was used as backbone to generate vectors expressing mCherry, H2B-mCherry, mVenus-p27K, tdTomato-p27K and a shuttle vector for co-expressing two proteins with Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) element by PCR, digestion by BamHI and SalI restriction enzymes and T4 DNA Ligase.
The mVenus fluorescent protein (yellow) was replaced by tdTomato by PCR from H2B-tdTomato and using BamHI and BsaBI restriction enzymes to make a tdTomato-p27k fusion protein in red color. Same strategy was used to create a fusion protein with rtTA-p27K for the genetic circuit in Figure 1 O. The rtTA sequence was obtained from Addgene #104543. The doxycycline expression vector was obtained from Addgene #131687 in which H2B-tdTomato fluorescent protein was introduced using BclI and NotI.
The fluorescent proteins mCherry or eGFP were cloned into the same third generation LV backbone with a normoxia-stable form of HIF1a, mHif-1α MYC (P402A/P577A/N813A) (Addgene #44028), here referred as HIF1a STBL . The resulting vectors had therefore the following structure mCherry-IRES-HIF1a STBL and GFP-IRES-HIF1a STBL . DNA was extracted by miniprep or maxiprep kits (QIAGEN) after transformation in Stbl3 E.coli (ThermoFisher). All plasmids were verified by Sanger sequencing.
Breast tumors were induced by intra-mammary fat pad injection of indicated breast cancer cell lines (4T07, EMT6 and D2A1). The injections were performed after introducing a 2mm incision to visualize the 4th mammary fat pad under isoflurane anesthesia. A total of 250,000 cells in 50μL sterile PBS were injected in the fat pad of the mammary gland. Local analgesic was used for pain relieve. Tumors were measured with a caliper and monitored twice a week and tumor volume was calculated as (length ∗ width ∗ width)/2.
Third generation lentivirus were produced by Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 transfection into HEK293T cells ( Brown et al., 2006 8. Brown, B.D. ∙ Venneri, M.A. ∙ Zingale, A. ... Endogenous microRNA regulation suppresses transgene expression in hematopoietic lineages and enables stable gene transfer Nat. Med. 2006; 12 :585-591 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supernatants were collected, passed through a 0.22μm filter, aliquoted and frozen, or directly used to transduce breast cancer cell lines.
For LV transduction, tumor cells were cultured with filtered LV in the presence of 1:2000 Polybrene Transfection Reagent (Millipore) for 16-24 hours, expanded, and subsequently FACS-sorted with Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) using the expressed fluorescent reporter. All transgenes introduced by LV transduction were expressed under the ubiquitous promoter PGK.
Amaxa 4D-Nucleofector X Unit device (Lonza) was used to generate knockout cells lines through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Briefly, 2.5μL 200μM trRNA, 2.5μL 200μM gRNA and 5μL 20μM recombinant CAS9 (Integrated DNA Technologies) were mixed to make Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The RNP was delivered into tumor cell lines using program A549 by SF Cell Line 4D-NucleofectorTM X Kit S (Lonza). 200,000 cells were used per reaction and recovered in 6-well plate for 4 days after nucleofection, and then subjected to a 2nd round of the same process. The efficiency of Ifnar1-/- was validated by flow cytometry analysis. Hif1a-/- cells were validated by western blot using HIF-1a (D1S7W) rabbit antibody from Cell Signaling Technology. The guide RNA sequences were: HIF1a (AGTGCACCCTAACAAGCCGG), Ifnar1 (GCTCGCTGTCGTGGGCGCGG).
Jedi CD8+ T cells as well as PD1 -/- Jedi CD8+ T cells were purified from spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) after obtaining a single cell suspension by mechanical disruption and filtering through a 70μm cell strainer. CD8+ T cells were selected with the mouse CD8+ T cells isolation kit (STEMCELL) following manufacturer’s instruction. 5-7×10 6 T cells (unless stated otherwise) were injected via tail vein per mouse in 200μL sterile PBS.
Tumors were collected and placed in 500μL of digestion solution (400U/mL CollagenaseIV, 6.8U/mL Hyaluronidase, 20μg/mL DNaseI and 10%FBS in HBSS). After mincing, they were transferred to a 10mL tube with 5mL digestion solution and incubated at 37 °C for 20 minutes on a rotator. Digested samples were then filtered through a 100μm cell strainer followed by red blood cell (RBC) lysis (Biolegend) for 5 minutes at room temperature (RT). Single cell suspensions were blocked with 1:100 dilution of TruStain FcX (#101319 Biolegend) in flow buffer (2mM EDTA 0.1% BSA PBS). Samples were then stained with the appropriate antibodies. DAPI (1:10,000) or 7AAD (1:100) were used as viability markers. Samples were analyzed by CytoFLEX (Beckman). Cells were FACS-sorted by Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and collected in 15mL tubes with 5mL of media. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v.10 software.
GFP+ and mCherry+ 4T07 cells in Figure 1 were directly FACS-sorted into TRIzol LS (Invitrogen) and submitted directly for RNA extraction and low-input RNA-sequencing to GENEWIZ. FACS-sorted mVenusp27K High and mVenus-p27K Neg 4T07, EMT6 and D2A1 cells from primary tumors were collected in media, centrifuged, and resuspended in 1mL TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted with miRNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were submitted to GENEWIZ for bulk RNA-sequencing.
Tumors were harvested and fixed in 20% Sucrose 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS overnight at 4°C. They were then embedded in OCT compound (Fisher Health Care) and stored in -80°C. Sections (10μm) were blocked in 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2% Normal Mouse Serum, 0.1% Tween-20 TBS for 1 hour at RT and incubated for 3 hours at RT or overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. Tissue was washed and, when needed, incubated with secondary fluorescently labelled antibodies for 2 hours before nuclear staining with DAPI (ThermoFisher). For Nuclear marker Ki67, samples were permeabilized with 1% TritonX-100 at 37 °C for 30min prior to staining. For biotin antibodies, an extra blocking step was done with Avidin/Biotin Blocking System (Biolegnd) following the instruction of the Kit. Antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution in blocking buffer. The stained tissue was then mounted on ProLong™ Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen) and covered with a #1.5 coverslip.
For assessment of tumor hypoxia, Pimonidazole (75mg/Kg of body weight) was intraperitoneally injected 30-60min prior to euthanasia. Staining was performed with Hypoxyprobe® following manufacturer instructions.

To evaluate cell proliferation in vivo , animals were injected intraperitoneally with 10mg/Kg of EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) daily during the last 5-8 days of tumor growth. Tumors were harvested and processed for immunofluorescence staining as described above. EdU was stained using the immunofluorescence BCK-EdU647 staining kit (BaseClick) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Evaluation of cell cycle state prior to adoptive transfer of Jedi T cells was performed using a genetic circuit as explained in Figure 1 O. 4T07 cells carrying both GFP and the genetic circuit were injected in the mammary fat pad. Animals received one intraperitoneal injection of Doxycycline (50mg/kg diluted in sterile PBS) 30h prior to adoptive transfer of Jedi T cells to ensure doxycycline had been eliminated from the system ( Bocker et al., 1981 7. Böcker, R. ∙ Estler, C.J. ∙ Maywald, M. ... Comparison of distribution of doxycycline in mice after oral and intravenous application measured by a high-performance liquid chromatographic method Arzneimittelforschung. 1981; 31 :2116-2117 PubMed Google Scholar ; Lucchetti et al., 2019 29. Lucchetti, J. ∙ Fracasso, C. ∙ Balducci, C. ... Plasma and brain concentrations of doxycycline after single and repeated doses in wild-type and APP23 mice J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2019; 368 :32-40 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5 million Jedi T cells were injected on day 6 of tumor growth. H2B-tdTomato+ tumor cells were quantified by flow cytometry on day 12 of tumor growth.
To test the tumor initiation potential of Jedi-resistant cancer cells: GFP or mCherry-expressing 4T07 cells were mixed 1:1 ratio and injected into the mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. 7 days after tumor inoculation 5M of Jedi T cells were adoptively transfer. In parallel, double transduced tdTomato-p27K and GFP-expressing 4T07 were injected into mammary fat pad of NSG mice as controls with no T cell killing. 14 days after tumor inoculation tumors from both groups were processed and surviving GFP+ cells were FACS-sorted. 500 live (DAPI-) were injected into mammary fat pad of new BALB/c mice.
To test the tumor initiation potential of p27K High cells: mCherry and mVenus-p27K expressing breast tumors (4T07, D2A1 or EMT6) were processed to obtain single cell suspensions by collagenase digestion. mCherry+ mVenus–p27K Neg and mCherry+ mVenus-p27K High cells were FACS-sorted. Tumor initiation potential was assessed by injecting 500 live (DAPI-) cells (for EMT6) and 1,000 cells (4T07 and D2A1) into mammary fat pad of new BALB/c mice.
Tumor single cell suspensions were resuspended in 200μM 2NBDG (BioVision) in flow buffer for 20 min at 37 °C, using equivalent number of cells across tumors. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry.
tdTomato-p27K-expressing 4T07 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of Kaede x BALB/c F1 females. Tumors were embedded in 2% low melting agarose and cut into 300μm slices by the Compresstome® VF 310-0Z vibrating microtome (Precisionary Instruments). Setting of the machine were 3 for vibration and 1-2 for speed depending on tumor consistency. Tumors were sectioned to obtain 2 consecutive slices together from 2 depths/regions from each tumor mass. Consecutive slices were used to photoconvert cells infiltrating tdTomato-negative areas and then cells in regions with tdTomato-p27K High cells. Slices were kept in a 12 well plate with IMDM media on ice. Photoconversion was performed in a Zeiss LSM710 single point-scanning confocal unit with galvanometer mirrors attached to a fully motorized Axio-Observer Z1 equipped with a Zeiss motorized stage using a Zeiss Plan Apochromat 20x/0.8 NA DIC air objective. Photoconversion of Kaede was performed using a 405nm 30mW diode AOTF modulated line set to 0.2 % transmittance laser and a time series of 325 cycles at a 1.58μsec/pixel pixel dwell times, using a 405 long-pass dichroic mirror. Kaede green and red (after photoconversion) fluorescence was collected by illuminating the sample with an argon multi-line 488 nm 25 mW Argon AOTF modulated line set to 0.2 % transmittance and a 561 nm 20mW DPSS AOTF modulated line set to 0.2 % transmittance, using a multi-bandpass dichroic mirror with 488/561cut off wavelengths (MBS 488/561). The emission wavelength range for the green and red fluorescence signal was set to 499-560 nm and 571-735 and collected by multi-alkali PMTs. No offset was applied. The microscope was controlled by ZEN Black SP2 acquisition software, scanned unidirectionally with a pixel dwell time of 1.58μsec/pixel, no averaging, a 12-bit digitizer, zoom 1.0x, a pixel size of 0.83 μm and pinhole set to 1 A.U. for 488 nm wavelength. Images were saved with the.czi file format.
Photoconverted slices were digested in collagense IV + DNAse as described above. Samples were digested for 15 min at 37°C and pass through a 100μm cell strainer followed by RBC lysis. Cells were washed and resuspended in 1mL flow buffer with DAPI (1:10,000) for sorting. Green/red double positive live cells were considered as the successful photoconverted ones and FACS-sorted into 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes with 500μL media at AriaIII.
mCherry from the original Figure 1 setting was replaced by Thy1.1 as a tumor marker. The CODEX technology requires three spectrally distinct dyes (Atto 550, Cy5, Alexa Fluor™ 750) for each imaging cycle and Atto550 overlaps with mCherry. Thy1.1 was not immunogenic in BALB/c mice and antibody in the panel was used to detect Thy1.1 (as the non-GFP cancer cells). Wildtype (untrunsduced) or Thy1.1:GFP-expressing mixed 4T07 tumors were harvested and dehydrated in 20% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C. Tumors were then embedded in OCT compound and stored in -80°C. Sections (8μm) were obtained onto poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and blocked for 1h at RT in Akoya CODEX Blocking Buffer® with IgG isotype controls and anti-mouse Fc receptors (93, Biolegend #101330). Then tissues were stained overnight at 4°C with the oligonucleotides-barcoded primary antibody cocktail, which were prepared following Akoya Biosciences CODEX Fresh-Frozen Tissue Staining protocol. The following primary antibodies were purchased from Akoya Biosciences: CD45, MHCII, CD3, CD11c. The rest primary antibodies were conjugated to Akoya barcodes according to Akoya Biosciences CODEX Antibody Conjugation protocol: p27, GFP, Thy1.1, F4/80, TIM3. Secondary fluorophore-tagged oligonucleotides (reporters) and DAPI (Akoya #7000003) were automatically added and washed away for each imaging cycle using Akoya CODEX system to allow multiplexed visualization on a single tissue section. Images ( Figures 4 L, 5 G, and S4 F) were acquired using a motorized Zeiss Axio Observer 7 inverted microscope equipped with a LED Colibri 7 fluorescence light source, and motorized scanning stage with a Z-piezo insert of 500 μm range. A Photometrics Prime BSI sCMOS 6.5 um photodiode size was used for detection. Images were acquired using a Zeiss 20x Plan Apo 20x/0.8 DICII air; the final digital resolution of the image was 0.325 μm/pixel. Signal from DAPI, Atto 550, Cy5 and Alexa Fluor™ 750, was collected by illuminating the sample with a Zeiss 90 HE DAPI/GFP/Cy3/Cy5 multi-band pass filter cube or a Zeiss 110 HE DAPI/GFP/Cy3.5/Cy7 multi-band-pass filter cube. Images were collected using Zen Blue (Zen 2.6 Pro) acquisition software and saved as .czi files. Analysis was done using CODEX Multiplex Analysis Viewer CODEXMAV (v1.5.0.8) plugin in Fiji (v2.1.0/1.53c).
BM-DCs were generated using Flt3l as already described in Agudo et al. (2014) 3. Agudo, J. ∙ Ruzo, A. ∙ Tung, N. ... The miR-126–VEGFR2 axis controls the innate response to pathogen-associated nucleic acids Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :54-62 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar . At day 9 BMDC were recovered with flow buffer 10mM EDTA and 90,000 live cells/well were seeded in a 96 well U bottom plate. Cells were conditioned for 2 hours to the required oxygen level (normoxia, 5% or 1%O2). Then either LPS (50ng/ml) or PolyI:C (5μg/ml) was added. Cells were kept with either LPS or PolyI:C for 18h at the corresponding oxygen level (so total 20h). Cells were detached with flow buffer 10mM EDTA and processed for flow cytometry assay.
Whole cell lysate (WCL) was collected from 1 million WT or Hif1a-/- cells using RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, CST) with Pierce Protease Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After incubating for 10 min on ice, WCL was spined for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C to get the supernatant. 3X loading buffer with DTT (CST) was added and boiled at 100°C for 5 min to denature. Protein samples were separated by Novex 4-20% Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Cell Signaling Technology, CST). The membranes were blocked by 5% milk TBST (0.1% Tween 20), then incubated with rabbit anti-HIF1A (D1S7W, 1:1000, CST) and mouse anti-Actin (8H10D10, 1: 5000, CST) overnight at 4°C. Followed by washing use TBST for 3 times, the membranes were incubated with AF555 Goat anti-mouse (1:5000,Invitrogen) and IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit (1:5000, LI-COR Biosciences) fluorescent secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. The membranes were imaged using Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System.
All images were analyzed using FiJi® (v2.0.0-rc-69/1.52i) ( Schindelin et al., 2012 50. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ).
T cell density per area was analyzed in tumors from Figures 1 E, 1F, 2 E, S1 E, S2 F, and S2G after CD3 staining. Areas were drawn using mVenus-p27K, GFP or mCherry and blindly to CD3 signal. After drawing the regions of interest (ROIs), CD3 signal was revealed, and T cells were counted manually. Area was calculated by FiJi after scaling images. Density of T cells was calculated as number of T cells/area (mm 2 ).
Colocalization analysis for nuclear markers (Ki67, mVenus-p27K and EdU) was done using DAPI channel for segmentation with the Trainable Weka Segmentation (v3.2.29) plugin. Nuclear particles were converted into a binary mask to analyze the fluorescent intensity in the different channels with the function Analyze Particles. Intensities of the different channels in the same particle were plotted to assess correlation or exclusion patterns.
Quantification of MHCII fluorescent intensity in DCs ( Figure 5 G) was performed on immunofluorescence images with CD11c and MHCII staining on mVenus-p27K-expressing 4T07 breast tumors. ROIs were drawn using only mVenus-p27K, being blind to both CD11c and MHCII. Afterwards, CD11c channel was used to create a binary mask after thresholding with Otsu method. Fluorescent intensity of the MHCII channel was measured using Analyze Particles function using particles generated by the CD11c mask.
FFPE sample slides from 10 anonymized TNBC patients were stained by the BWH Pathology Core with E-Cadherin (24E10, CST), p27K (57/Kip1/p27, BD), Ki67 (SP6, Biocare) and CD3 (F7.2.38, Agilent). Samples were imaged with Zeiss Axio Observer 7 inverted microscope as explained in the immunofluorescence method section. For T cell enrichment analysis areas surrounding T cells that were able to infiltrate E-Cadherin+ areas were drawn and then evaluated for Ki67 or p27 positive cells. Total number of positive cells were normalized by area to obtain density of p27+ and Ki67+ cells in the vicinity of T cells.
GENEWIZ performed basic computational analysis for quality controls and constructed the gene matrices. Gene matrices were normalized using DESeq2 size factors and filtering for a minimum of 10 read per condition (60-80 rowSums). The resulting genes with adjusted p-Value < 0.05 were considered significant for GO term enrichment analysis at https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ . Log 2 fold change ≥0.5 was considered as upregulated and ≤ -0.5 as downregulated genes. Volcano plots were generated with the package EnhancedVolcano from Bioconductor. Heatmaps were generated in excel using Z-score across different samples in a given gene after after counts per million mapped reads (CPM) normalization.
Raw images were processed using Akoya CODEX Processor® for background subtraction, deconvolution, extended depth of field and shading correction. CODEXMAV plugin in ImageJ was used for visualization and selection of cell populations. To assess T cell exhaustion, p27 positive versus negative areas or Thy1.1+ versus GFP+ areas in tumor images were drawn and then evaluated for TIM3 expression on T cells (CD45+ CD3+ MHCII- CD11c- F4/80-). To assess DC function, same selected areas were used. DCs were considered as CD45+CD11c+F4/80-CD3-. MHCII intensities were recorded for each DC. T cells were normalized dividing the total number of T cells by the area (μm 2 ) of the ROI. MHCII intensities from DC were normalized and centered using a Z-score to be able to pool the different experiments eliminating the batch effect.
RNAseq data was aligned using the STAR software ( Dobin et al., 2013 11. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further transcript per million (TPM) quantification was performed using RSEM ( Li and Dewey, 2011 26. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13966) PubMed Google Scholar ). Canonical pathways compiled in MSigDB from pathway databases, namely the C2 CP gene sets, were used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis using 1000 permutations by phenotype ( Subramanian et al., 2005 56. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33572) PubMed Google Scholar ).
FACS-sorted live cells were submitted to the Bigham and Women’s Hospital Single Cell Genomics Core for 10x genomics. Samples from different areas were tagged using hashed antibodies and then pooled to reduce technical variability in the preparation of the 10X library following an approved protocol from the core ( Table S1 ). The BWH Single Cell Genomics Core performed basic computational analysis using Cell Ranger pipeline and provided us the filtered matrix of read counts per gene in each cell.
Seurat v4.0.3 package ( Hao et al., 2021 18. Hao, Y. ∙ Hao, S. ∙ Andersen-Nissen, E. ... Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data Cell. 2021; 184 :3573-3587.e29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4942) PubMed Google Scholar ) for R was used to analyze the scRNA-seq data. Following Seurat-guided clustering tutorial (Source: vignettes/pbmc3k_ tutorial.Rmd), cells were filtered using <15% of mitochondrial genes reads to eliminate dead cells. We distinguish unique hashtags from each cell by excluding the cells that have > 250 read count in both hashtags. We excluded cells outlier to the 200-25000 read count (nCount RNA) to eliminate doublets and debris. Having filtered our data, we normalized, scaled and log-transformed the matrix (NormalizeData function) and then we centered the mean to 0 and the variance to 1 (ScaleData function) without regressing out variables.
Next, we performed a linear dimensional reduction by PCA using the top 2,000 most variable genes (FindVariableFeatures using the vst method and a span of 0.3). Based on an elbow plot (function ElbowPlot) we selected 30 PCs to calculate the shared nearest neighbor graph based on the calculated Euclidean distance (FindNeighbors function) and clustered our data using the Louvain algorithm ( Blondel et al., 2008 6. Blondel, V.D. ∙ Guillaume, J.L. ∙ Lambiotte, R. ... Fast unfolding of communities in large networks arXiv. 2008; Crossref Google Scholar ) with a resolution of 0.5, with the Seurat function FindClusters ( McDavid et al., 2013 31. McDavid, A. ∙ Finak, G. ∙ Chattopadyay, P.K. ... Data exploration, quality control and testing in single-cell qPCR-based gene expression experiments Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :461-467 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 32.

Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clustered data was displayed using the UMAP dimensional reduction (RunUMAP function, McInnes et al., 2020 33. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: uniform manifold aproximation and projection of dimension reduction arXiv. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ). Clusters were identified using well known markers for immune populations and fibroblasts as described in the Figures 4 C, S4 A, S4E, S4H, S5 A, and S5B.
Cells from the T cell cluster were subjected to another round of unsupervised clustering as described above, except 10 PCs were used, to find further differences among QCC and non-QCC areas.
Differential expression analysis was performed using the Seurat function FindMarkers. Genes were pre-filtered for a minimum log fold change of 0.25 and detectable expression in at least 10% of cells in the cluster, then compared for differential expression using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 27. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes with an FDR-adjusted p-value less than 0.1 were selected as input for gene-set enrichment analysis using GO biological processes as implemented in the clusterProfiler package from Bioconductor ( Wu et al., 2021a 62. Wu, T. ∙ Hu, E. ∙ Xu, S. ... clusterProfiler 4.0: A universal enrichment tool for interpreting omics data Innovation (N Y). 2021; 2 :100141 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4710) PubMed Google Scholar ), using a set size between 3 and 800 genes and an FDR-adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05. Relevant genes were curated from the GSEA to generate heatmaps. Average gene expression for each tumor and area was generated using AverageExpression.
Heatmaps from Figures S4 E and S5 A were generated with the individual cell values and the top 10 differentially expressed genes per cluster. Heatmaps with specific genes selected from the differential analysis between QCC and non-QCC areas and selected signatures among the same cluster were generated using the average value of cells coming from the same tumor and area with the function AverageExpression.
We performed a Fisher’s exact test for each cell type between the two different groups followed by Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction to obtain adjusted p value.
To understand differences in the regulation of CD8+ T cells, we generated a co-expression gene network. Because of the zero-inflated and highly noisy nature of single-cell transcriptome data, we inferred co-expression of gene pairs using BigSCale2 ( Iacono et al., 2019 22. Iacono, G. ∙ Massoni-Badosa, R. ∙ Heyn, H. Single-cell transcriptomics unveils gene regulatory network plasticity Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :110 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), which pools cells with similar expression profile. We considered the set of genes from the co-expression network that were direct neighbors of the 124 genes that had been identified as downregulated in the DEG analysis, and we refer to this as the DEG module. The DEG module was visualized by cytoscape (ver 3.7.1) ( Shannon et al., 2003 53. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (32512) PubMed Google Scholar ). We obtained the enriched pathways for the DEG module by GO enrichment analysis ( Mi et al., 2019 35. Mi, H. ∙ Muruganujan, A. ∙ Ebert, D. ... PANTHER version 14: more genomes, a new PANTHER GO-slim and improvements in enrichment analysis tools Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D419-D426 Crossref Scopus (1876) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in Gene Ontology website ( http://geneontology.org/ ).
Hypoxic signature scores were calculated using the Seurat function AddModuleScore that calculates the average expression of a given signature per cell and subtracts it from the average expression of randomly selected control features. AddModuleScore ( Tirosh et al., 2016 57. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Crossref Scopus (2751) PubMed Google Scholar ) was run using 100 control features. Scores were averaged within all cells from the same cluster and tumor region (p27K+ or p27K- areas). To compare the hypoxic signature across populations we generated a delta score subtracting the average score of p27K- areas to that of p27K+ areas for each cluster of cells. Hypoxic signature was formed by: Hif1a, Slc2a1, Vegfa, Hmox1, Bnip3, Nos2, Mmp2, Sod3, Cited2, Ldha. This list is constituted by genes from the GO:0001666 “Response to hypoxia” that were upregulated in mVenus-p27K+ QCCs. Statistical analysis was performed by two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test followed by BH correction.
All analysis was performed using data from at least three independent biological replicates (exact number of replicates are stated in the figure legend). Unless stated otherwise, all statistical analyses were performed in PRISM6 software using paired or unpaired Student’s t test.
