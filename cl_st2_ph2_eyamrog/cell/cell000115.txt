Title: High-Resolution mRNA and Secretome Atlas of Human Enteroendocrine Cells


Abstract: Summary

Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) sense intestinal content and release hormones to regulate gastrointestinal activity, systemic metabolism, and food intake. Little is known about the molecular make-up of human EEC subtypes and the regulated secretion of individual hormones. Here, we describe an organoid-based platform for functional studies of human EECs. EEC formation is induced in vitro by transient expression of NEUROG3 . A set of gut organoids was engineered in which the major hormones are fluorescently tagged. A single-cell mRNA atlas was generated for the different EEC subtypes, and their secreted products were recorded by mass-spectrometry. We note key differences to murine EECs, including hormones, sensory receptors, and transcription factors. Notably, several hormone-like molecules were identified. Inter-EEC communication is exemplified by secretin-induced GLP-1 secretion. Indeed, individual EEC subtypes carry receptors for various EEC hormones. This study provides a rich resource to study human EEC development and function.

Section: Introduction

The principal function of the intestine is to digest food and absorb nutrients, but as the largest hormone producing organ, it also secretes hormones through its enteroendocrine cells (EECs) ( Gribble and Reimann, 2017 31. Gribble, F.M. ∙ Reimann, F. Signalling in the gut endocrine axis Physiol. Behav. 2017; 176 :183-188 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). EECs are rare secretory cells, comprising <1% of the epithelial cells. Apical EEC receptors sense chemicals in the intestinal lumen derived from food and microbiota ( Furness et al., 2013 26. Furness, J.B. ∙ Rivera, L.R. ∙ Cho, H.-J. ... The gut as a sensory organ Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10 :729-740 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hormones secreted by EECs signal to the local enteric nervous system and to distant organs including the pancreas and the brain, thus controlling food intake, insulin release, secretion of digestive enzymes, and bowel movement. EECs are therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases (i.e., obesity and diabetes), illustrated by recently introduced type 2 diabetes drugs that stabilize the hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) or activate its receptor, leading to release of insulin from pancreatic β cells ( Sharma et al., 2018 74. Sharma, D. ∙ Verma, S. ∙ Vaidya, S. ... Recent updates on GLP-1 agonists: Current advancements & challenges Biomed. Pharmacother. 2018; 108 :952-962 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ).
EECs produce ∼20 different hormones. GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are the incretin hormones that stimulate insulin secretion. The enterochromaffin (EC) cells produce 90% of body serotonin and regulate bowel movement ( Worthington et al., 2018 87. Worthington, J.J. ∙ Reimann, F. ∙ Gribble, F.M. Enteroendocrine cells-sensory sentinels of the intestinal environment and orchestrators of mucosal immunity Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11 :3-20 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Motilin (MLN) is a human EEC hormone, which controls gut contractions in the inter-digestive state ( Worthington et al., 2018 87. Worthington, J.J. ∙ Reimann, F. ∙ Gribble, F.M. Enteroendocrine cells-sensory sentinels of the intestinal environment and orchestrators of mucosal immunity Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11 :3-20 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple hormones control appetite, including the appetite-inducing ghrelin (GHRL), the appetite-reducing peptide YY (PYY), and cholecystokinin (CCK). Gastrin (GAST) is secreted in the duodenum to control luminal acid by regulating proton secretion of stomach parietal cells. Somatostatin (SST) is an inhibitory peptide for most other intestinal hormones ( Worthington et al., 2018 87. Worthington, J.J. ∙ Reimann, F. ∙ Gribble, F.M. Enteroendocrine cells-sensory sentinels of the intestinal environment and orchestrators of mucosal immunity Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11 :3-20 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Lgr5+ cells generate all differentiated intestinal cell types ( Barker et al., 2007 3. Barker, N. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Kuipers, J. ... Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5 Nature. 2007; 449 :1003-1007 Crossref Scopus (4307) PubMed Google Scholar ). The murine EEC subtypes are historically defined by their principle hormone product: L cells (Glp-1, Pyy), I cells (Cck), K cells (gastric inhibitory protein, Gip), N cells (neurotensin, Nts), S cells (secretin, Sct), EC cells (serotonin/5-HT), X cells (Ghrl), G cells (Gast), and D cells (Sst) ( Engelstoft et al., 2013a; Gehart et al., 2019 18. Engelstoft, M.S. ∙ Egerod, K.L. ∙ Lund, M.L. ... Enteroendocrine cell types revisited Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2013; 13 :912-921 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ... Identification of Enteroendocrine Regulators by Real-Time Single-Cell Differentiation Mapping Cell. 2019; 176 :1158-1173.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although this suggests that EEC phenotypes are hardwired, we have recently found that the crypt-villus BMP-signaling gradient induces hormone switching within individual murine EEC lineages ( Beumer et al., 2018 6. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). The relative abundance of EEC subtypes greatly differs along the proximal-distal gastrointestinal axis. Studies on EECs have largely focused on murine models, exploiting a variety of reporter mice for subsets of EECs to monitor their responses to nutritional or genetic challenges ( Goldspink et al., 2018 29. Goldspink, D.A. ∙ Reimann, F. ∙ Gribble, F.M. Models and Tools for Studying Enteroendocrine Cells Endocrinology. 2018; 159 :3874-3884 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). We have recently described the developmental hierarchy of murine subtypes EECs using a mouse model in which endogenous Neurogenin-3 expression, the main determinant of EEC fate, was coupled to the production of two separate fluorescent proteins with different half-lives ( Gehart et al., 2019 28. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ... Identification of Enteroendocrine Regulators by Real-Time Single-Cell Differentiation Mapping Cell. 2019; 176 :1158-1173.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single-cell RNA sequencing of sorted EEC progenitors allowed for construction of a time-resolved development roadmap of the mouse EEC lineage.
Because the human diet and microbiome and that of rodents differ greatly ( Nguyen et al., 2015 54. Nguyen, T.L.A. ∙ Vieira-Silva, S. ∙ Liston, A. ... How informative is the mouse for human gut microbiota research? Dis. Model. Mech. 2015; 8 :1-16 Crossref Scopus (872) PubMed Google Scholar ), secretory hormone responses may also differ between these species. The study of human EECs is challenging because of their rarity and the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models. Few human EEC-immortalized cell lines exist, and these differ substantially from their wild-type counterparts ( Goldspink et al., 2018 29. Goldspink, D.A. ∙ Reimann, F. ∙ Gribble, F.M. Models and Tools for Studying Enteroendocrine Cells Endocrinology. 2018; 159 :3874-3884 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is currently no atlas of human EEC subtypes. Although some inducers of hormone secretion have been described in mice, there has been no experimental model to systematically assess such secretagogues for human EECs. Here, we describe an organoid-based platform to provide a detailed molecular and functional description of human EECs.

Section: Results

Previous attempts to create human EECs in vitro have relied on growth-factor-based differentiation ( Beumer et al., 2018 6. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) or overexpression of NEUROG3 , the key transcription factor to instruct EEC fate ( McCracken et al., 2014; Sinagoga et al., 2018 50. McCracken, K.W. ∙ Catá, E.M. ∙ Crawford, C.M. ...

Deriving functional human enteroendocrine cells from pluripotent stem cells Development. 2018; 145 :dev165795 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both induced-pluripotent-stem-cell- ( Zhang et al., 2019 90. Zhang, X. ∙ McGrath, P.S. ∙ Salomone, J. ...

Chang-Graham, A.L. ∙ Danhof, H.A. ∙ Engevik, M.A. ... Human Intestinal Enteroids With Inducible Neurogenin-3 Expression as a Novel Model of Gut Hormone Secretion Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2019; 8 :209-229 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) approaches allow studying of human EEC biology, such as modeling of hereditary NEUROG3 mutations and virally induced serotonin release ( Chang-Graham et al., 2019 11. Chang-Graham, A.L. ∙ Danhof, H.A. ∙ Engevik, M.A. ... Human Intestinal Enteroids With Inducible Neurogenin-3 Expression as a Novel Model of Gut Hormone Secretion Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2019; 8 :209-229 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, imperfect differentiation and regional restriction of the donor material have limited these studies to a subset of human EECs.
To generate the full spectrum of human EECs, we established organoids from healthy adult proximal small intestine (duodenum), distal small intestine (ileum), and the ascending colon ( Sato et al., 2011 70. Sato, T. ∙ Stange, D.E. ∙ Ferrante, M. ... Long-term expansion of epithelial organoids from human colon, adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and Barrett’s epithelium Gastroenterology. 2011; 141 :1762-1772 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2523) PubMed Google Scholar ). These organoids were transduced with a doxycycline-inducible NEUROG3 construct ( Figure 1 A). dTomato was inserted 3′ to the NEUROG3 reading frame, separated by a self-cleavable P2A sequence to avoid creating a fusion protein. A 48 h-pulsed expression of NEUROG3 in the basic medium “ENR” promoted the expression of the broad EEC marker chromogranin A ( CHGA) ( Figure 1 B). Proximal small intestinal (SI) hormones such as GAST , CCK , and MLN were enriched in duodenal organoids, whereas NTS , PYY , and GCG were predominantly observed in distal SI organoids. Of note, GCG encodes the preproglucagon prehormone, a protein precursor to a set of hormones including GLP-1 (see below). SST was comparably expressed in proximal and distal organoids, consistent with its profile in the mouse gut. A recent single-cell RNA sequencing study generated the profile of 83 colonic EECs, suggesting that the human colon only contains serotonin-producing ECs and L cells positive for GCG and PYY ( Parikh et al., 2019 58. Parikh, K. ∙ Antanaviciute, A. ∙ Fawkner-Corbett, D. ... Colonic epithelial cell diversity in health and inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2019; 567 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, induced colon organoids only yielded serotonin-producing ECs and GCG-expressing EECs. We found that hormone expression peaked 5 days after initiation of NEUROG3 expression ( Figure S1 A). Shorter doxycycline inductions stimulated the production of fewer EECs, whereas continuous doxycycline treatment throughout the differentiation window enhanced EC generation at the expense of L cells ( Figure S1 B). This suggests that Neurogenin-3 expression duration determines EEC subtype. We chose a 48 h doxycycline treatment in ENR, the maximum duration of NEUROG3 expression in vivo ( Gehart et al., 2019 28. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ... Identification of Enteroendocrine Regulators by Real-Time Single-Cell Differentiation Mapping Cell. 2019; 176 :1158-1173.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under these conditions, EECs in organoids displayed a normal morphology as visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Note the typical basal concentration of hormone vesicles ( Figure 1 C).
By immunofluorescent staining ( Figure S1 C), we observed mutually exclusive expression for MLN and GAST for GHRL and CHGA and for Serotonin and GLP-1, whereas a subset of GIP-positive cells co-expressed CCK. This closely resembled the co-expression patterns in mice (with the exception of MLN, a pseudogene in mice) ( Haber et al., 2017 34. Haber, A.L. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Rogel, N. ... A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium Nature. 2017; 551 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 C). Virtually all EECs, as identified by the broad marker CHGA, were derived from NEUROG3-overexpressing cells ( Figure S1 C). A definitive hallmark of a mature EEC is its ability to secrete hormones. Indeed, exposure to forskolin, a stimulator of adenylate cyclase, greatly enhanced secreted GLP-1 levels ( Figure 1 D). We have previously reported that BMP signaling induces hormone expression changes in mature murine EECs in villi ( Beumer et al., 2018 6. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with our observations in murine EECs, we found that activation of BMP signaling enhances the expression of NTS while reducing GLP-1 ( Figures S2 A and S2B).
Because the initial expression of NEUROG3 occurs at random positions along the crypt axis in mice ( Gehart et al., 2019 28. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ... Identification of Enteroendocrine Regulators by Real-Time Single-Cell Differentiation Mapping Cell. 2019; 176 :1158-1173.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that exposure to other crypt differentiation signals (i.e., Notch, Wnt) prior to this expression pulse could potentially determine EEC subtype. We modulated these signals prior to inducing NEUROG3 expression, mimicking the different initiation sites along the intestinal crypt axis ( Figure S2 C). As a control, we modulated the same signals after NEUROG3 induction ( Figure S2 D). Inhibition of Notch before or after expression of NEUROG3 did not affect EEC differentiation ( Figure S2 E). Inhibition of Wnt signaling before (but not after) the NEUROG3 pulse stimulated expression of MLN at the expense of GCG , while SST was unaffected ( Figure S2 E). Immunofluorescence revealed an increase in the number of MLN-producing cells rather than in the “per cell” expression levels ( Figure S2 F), resulting in a strong shift in L cell/M cell ratio ( Figure S2 G).
Mouse models in which hormones are fluorescently tagged exist for several murine EEC hormones that were instrumental to study EEC subsets: Chga, Gcg, Gip, Cck, Ghrl, and Pyy ( Engelstoft et al., 2013b; 2015; Gong et al., 2003; Parker et al., 2009; Reimann et al., 2008; Sommer and Mostoslavsky, 2014 19.

CRISPR-Cas9 targeting followed by homology-directed repair (HDR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) allows the introduction of exogenous genetic material ( Bukhari and Müller, 2019; He et al., 2016; Schmid-Burgk et al., 2016 9.

Commun. 2016; 7 :12338 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). To mark ECs, we labeled tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), the rate-limiting enzyme involved in serotonin synthesis. Using HDR, we tagged TPH1 with fluorescent mClover separated by a self-cleaving P2A site. We recently optimized a strategy for site-specific introduction of DNA into organoids using NHEJ (CRISPR-HOT) ( Artegiani et al., 2020 1. Artegiani, B. ∙ Hendriks, D. ∙ Beumer, J. ... Fast and efficient generation of knock-in human organoids using homology-independent CRISPR-Cas9 precision genome editing Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :321-331 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ), which allowed fluorescently labeling of multiple secreted hormones ( Figure 2 A).
We generated a biobank of hormone reporter organoids termed EEC-TAG, consisting of duodenal, ileal, and colon organoids for a total of 10 human hormones ( Figure 2 B). All organoid lines showed complete overlap between fluorescent reporters and the corresponding hormone product ( Figure 2 C). The fluorescently tagged hormones localized to cytoplasmic vesicles. Serial tagging into the same organoid lines for multi-hormone labeling was feasible ( Figure 2 D).
Calcium signaling induces hormone secretion ( Goldspink et al., 2018 29. Goldspink, D.A. ∙ Reimann, F. ∙ Gribble, F.M. Models and Tools for Studying Enteroendocrine Cells Endocrinology. 2018; 159 :3874-3884 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). We stably introduced a turquoise Ca 2+ sensor (Tq-Ca-FLITS) into NEUROG3 dTomato TPH1 mClover reporter organoids using lentiviral transduction. The resulting genotype of the organoids is NEUROG3 dTomato TPH1 mClover CaFLITS Turqouise . We stimulated the olfactory receptor OR51E2, of which the mouse homolog ( Olfr78 ) is reported to be expressed in mouse EECs ( Fleischer et al., 2015; Jovancevic et al., 2017 23. Fleischer, J. ∙ Bumbalo, R. ∙ Bautze, V. ... Expression of odorant receptor Olfr78 in enteroendocrine cells of the colon Cell Tissue Res. 2015; 361 :697-710 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Jovancevic, N. ∙ Khalfaoui, S. ∙ Weinrich, M. ... Odorant receptor 51E2 agonist β-ionone regulates RPE cell migration and proliferation Front. Physiol. 2017; 8 :888 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). HEK cells overexpressing OR51E2 elicit a calcium response when stimulated with the selective agonist beta-ionone ( Pietraszewska-Bogiel et al., 2019 61. Pietraszewska-Bogiel, A. ∙ van Weeren, L. ∙ Goedhart, J. Seeing cells smell: Dynamic optical measurements of Ca 2+ and cAMP signaling from Olfactory Receptors transiently expressed in HEK293TN cells bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ). OR51E2 is most strongly upregulated in distal organoids ( Figure 2 E). When reporter organoids were stimulated with beta-ionone, we observed calcium sparking in EECs that were TPH1-negative ( Figure 2 F), illustrating that sensors combined with hormone reporters can visualize activation of human EEC subtypes.
Studies have utilized reporter mice to enrich for hormone-producing cells when performing single-cell RNA sequencing. This approach cannot be used for primary human EECs, making the generation of a detailed atlas from SI tissue challenging. Murine EECs taken from primary tissue and from organoids are essentially identical ( Gehart et al., 2019; Grün et al., 2015 28. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ... Identification of Enteroendocrine Regulators by Real-Time Single-Cell Differentiation Mapping Cell. 2019; 176 :1158-1173.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Grün, D. ∙ Lyubimova, A. ∙ Kester, L. ... Single-cell messenger RNA sequencing reveals rare intestinal cell types Nature. 2015; 525 :251-255 Crossref Scopus (852) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore exploited the human NEUROG3-induced organoids to perform single-cell RNA sequencing. NEUROG3 was induced in duodenal, ileal, and colon organoids in the absence or presence of BMP (to generate the crypt- and villus-“versions” of EECs; Figure S2 ). Data from 8,448 cells were generated and processed by sorting and robot-assisted transcriptome sequencing (SORT-seq; Muraro et al., 2016 53. Muraro, M.J. ∙ Dharmadhikari, G. ∙ Grün, D. ... A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :385-394.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S3 A and S3B) and analyzed using RaceID3, a clustering method based on k-medoids ( Herman et al., 2018 38. Herman, J.S. ∙ Sagar ∙ Grün, D. FateID infers cell fate bias in multipotent progenitors from single-cell RNA-seq data Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :379-386 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). After filtering, a broad intestinal cell type atlas was built from 4,281 cells ( Figures S3 B and S3C). This atlas contained five large clusters: CHGA -positive EECs (2,255) and the following well-defined “contaminant” lineages: FABP1 -positive enterocytes (585), OLFM4 -positive stem cells (113), rare MUC2 -positive goblet cells (33), LYZ / MMP7 -positive Paneth cells (11), and several progenitor populations ( Figure S3 D).
Neuropeptide W ( NPW ) and VGF , recently observed in bulk EEC RNA sequencing ( Roberts et al., 2019 65. Roberts, G.P. ∙ Larraufie, P. ∙ Richards, P. ... Comparison of human and murine enteroendocrine cells by transcriptomic and peptidomic profiling Diabetes. 2019; 68 :1062-1072 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), were broadly expressed ( Figure S3 C). Although the function of VGF remains elusive, NPW is known to increase food intake when injected in the hypothalamus ( Levine et al., 2005 44. Levine, A.S. ∙ Winsky-Sommerer, R. ∙ Huitron-Resendiz, S. ... Injection of neuropeptide W into paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus increases food intake Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2005; 288 :R1727-R1732 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunofluorescence confirmed protein expression of NPW by EECs in sections of human intestine ( Figure 3 A).
All EECs and their progenitors were identified by thresholding for expression of the generic EEC marker CHGA and thresholding against MUC2 , FABP1 , LYZ , and OLFM4 . An EEC atlas was constructed from 2,255 cells (of which 805 cells were BMP-treated) ( Figures 3 B, 3C, and S4 A). The major clusters overlapped with their mouse equivalents, and the different EEC subtypes followed regional identity ( Figure S4 B) ( Haber et al., 2017 34. Haber, A.L. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Rogel, N. ... A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium Nature. 2017; 551 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar ). The human EEC atlas significantly differed from the mouse tissue EEC atlas ( Figure S4 C) ( Gehart et al., 2019 28. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ... Identification of Enteroendocrine Regulators by Real-Time Single-Cell Differentiation Mapping Cell. 2019; 176 :1158-1173.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). To validate the in vitro EEC identities, we searched for EECs in a large single-cell dataset obtained from healthy and diseased human small intestines of various ages. Of 11,302 cells represented in this dataset, we derived mRNA signatures for 39 human EECs, underscoring the challenge of deriving single EEC mRNA signatures from human ileal biopsies ( Figure S4 D).
The largest cluster was formed by TPH1 -expressing EC cells, highly expressing CHGA (as in mouse) and representing the most frequent EEC type in vivo ( Figures 3 B and 3C). ECs occurred in three “flavors”: REG4 high and REG4 low cells (in cluster 4), which also exist in murine intestine ( Haber et al., 2017 34. Haber, A.L. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Rogel, N. ... A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium Nature. 2017; 551 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar ). A third population of ECs, not observed in mice, expressed high levels of the secretogranin SCG2 and occurred mostly in proximal SI organoids (cluster 9) ( Figures 3 B and 3C). All human ECs highly expressed dopa decarboxylase ( DDC ) involved in serotonin biosynthesis, as well as SLC18A1 , involved in serotonin transport ( Figure S4 E) ( Lohoff et al., 2006 48. Lohoff, F.W. ∙ Dahl, J.P. ∙ Ferraro, T.N. ... Variations in the vesicular monoamine transporter 1 gene (VMAT1/SLC18A1) are associated with bipolar i disorder Neuropsychopharmacology. 2006; 31 :2739-2747 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). The prototypical EC markers CHGB and GPR112 were broadly expressed by human ECs, as was the olfactory receptor OR51E1 (mouse homolog Olfr558), a marker of serotonin-producing neuroendocrine tumors in man ( Figure S4 E) ( Cui et al., 2013 15. Cui, T. ∙ Tsolakis, A.V. ∙ Li, S.C. ... Olfactory receptor 51E1 protein as a potential novel tissue biomarker for small intestine neuroendocrine carcinomas Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2013; 168 :253-261 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ).
G cells produce Gast and are largely restricted to the mouse stomach, whereas in man, expression continues more distally along the GI tract in EECs ( Engelstoft et al., 2013a 18. Engelstoft, M.S. ∙ Egerod, K.L. ∙ Lund, M.L. ... Enteroendocrine cell types revisited Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2013; 13 :912-921 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells expressing GAST (cluster 3) co-expressed the receptor for Gast-releasing peptide, GRPR , a marker of G cells in mouse stomach ( Figures 3 B and 3C). GAST -expression often overlapped with high expression of the incretin GIP (same cluster 3), the main hormone product of murine K cells. We named these cells G/K cells ( Figures 3 B and 3C). In histological sections, we confirmed overlapping expression for these two hormones ( Figure 3 E). Some cells in cluster 3 almost exclusively produced either GIP or GAST , as seen on intestinal sections and in the atlas. The L cell lineage clusters 8 and 13 displayed largely overlapping expression of GCG , NTS , and PYY ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Cluster 2 contained SST-positive D cells, also expressing the transcription factor HHEX . HHEX has been described in murine pancreatic and intestinal Sst-producing cells ( Haber et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2014 34. Haber, A.L. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Rogel, N. ... A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium Nature. 2017; 551 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar 89. Zhang, J. ∙ McKenna, L.B. ∙ Bogue, C.W. ... The diabetes gene Hhex maintains δ-cell differentiation and islet function Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :829-834 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, human D cells in tissue and organoids lacked expression of amylin ( IAPP ), a peptide hormone expressed in mouse D cells ( Figures 3 B, 3C, and S4 D).
Mln + cells do not exist in mice. We identified a cluster of cells producing MLN and GHRL (cluster 5). A gradient from predominantly MLN - to predominantly GHRL -expressing cells can be observed in t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) space ( Figures 3 C and 3D). We termed these M/X or X/M cells (based on the highest expression of either MLN or GHRL , respectively) and speculate that these might represent different states of the same cell type. Indeed, BMP treatment reduced levels of GHRL , whereas MLN levels were slightly increased ( Figure S6 B). M/X cells were further characterized by ENPP1 expression, a known regulator of insulin responses and extracellular ATP levels ( Di Paola et al., 2011 16. Di Paola, R. ∙ Caporarello, N. ∙ Marucci, A. ... ENPP1 affects insulin action and secretion: evidences from in vitro studies PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e19462 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), similarly expressed by murine X cells ( Figures 3 C and 3D). GHRL requires a specific acyl modification by the acyl-CoA synthetase Acsl1 in mouse stomach X cells ( Bando et al., 2016 2. Bando, M. ∙ Iwakura, H. ∙ Koyama, H. ... High incorporation of long-chain fatty acids contributes to the efficient production of acylated ghrelin in ghrelin-producing cells FEBS Lett. 2016; 590 :992-1001 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human M/X cells and mouse intestinal X cells both expressed high levels of Acsl1 ( Figures 3 C and 3D).
We next searched for EEC genes differentially expressed between human and mouse ( Figure S4 F). The heparin-binding growth factor midkine ( MDK ) was highly expressed by all human EEC types but not by, e.g., goblet cells ( Figure 4 A). MDK is a reported biomarker of human intestinal neuroendocrine tumors ( Edfeldt et al., 2017 17. Edfeldt, K. ∙ Daskalakis, K. ∙ Bäcklin, C. ... DcR3, TFF3, and Midkine Are Novel Serum Biomarkers in Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Neuroendocrinology. 2017; 105 :170-181 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Midkine has been associated with obesity and inhibits insulin signaling in adipocytes ( Fan et al., 2014 22. Fan, N. ∙ Sun, H. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Midkine, a potential link between obesity and insulin resistance PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e88299 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). The carboxypeptidase CPB1 was produced by most EECs (highest in M/X cells), with the exception of ECs ( Figure 4 A). Carboxypeptidases are typically involved in hormone processing ( Sapio and Fricker, 2014 68. Sapio, M.R. ∙ Fricker, L.D. Carboxypeptidases in disease: insights from peptidomic studies Proteomics Clin. Appl. 2014; 8 :327-337 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression of Cpb1 has been observed in the rat pancreas ( Yu et al., 2017 88. Yu, S.L. ∙ Han, S. ∙ Kim, H.R. ... Phosphorylation of carboxypeptidase B1 protein regulates β-cell proliferation Int. J. Mol. Med. 2017; 40 :1397-1404 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). FGF14 is a human pan-EEC marker—with very limited expression in murine EECs—and belongs to a set of intracellular FGFs, that play a role in the clustering of ion channels in neurons ( Figures 4 A and S4 F) ( Pablo and Pitta, 2017 55. Pablo, J.L. ∙ Pitta, G.S. FGF14 is a regulator of KCNQ2/3 channels Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2017; Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar ). The olfactory receptor OR51E2 was sporadically expressed by different EEC subtypes, with highest levels occurring in PYY + cells ( Figure 4 A). The mouse homolog Olfr78 was lowly expressed in ECs only ( Figure S4 F). The enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase ( TDO2 ) was found in duodenal EECs from the proximal intestine ( Figures 4 A and S4 A). TDO2 can metabolize tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway and is one of the primary regulators of availability of this amino acid. Tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin and Tdo2 knockout mice experience increased serotonin levels ( Too et al., 2016 82. Too, L.K. ∙ Li, K.M. ∙ Suarna, C. ... Deletion of TDO2, IDO-1 and IDO-2 differentially affects mouse behavior and cognitive function Behav. Brain Res. 2016; 312 :102-117 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that Tdo2 could locally regulate serotonin production in the gut. We noted the tachykinin peptide-coding TAC3 w as a broadly expressed gene in human EECs, whereas the mouse homolog Tac2 is not expressed in the murine intestine ( Figure 4 A). TAC3 codes for neurokinin B and has been described as a regulator of secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the human hypothalamus ( Sanger, 2004 67. Sanger, G.J. Neurokinin NK1 and NK3 receptors as targets for drugs to treat gastrointestinal motility disorders and pain Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141 :1303-1312 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the main receptor for NKB, NK 3 (coded by TACR3) , has been implicated in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility ( Sanger, 2004 67. Sanger, G.J. Neurokinin NK1 and NK3 receptors as targets for drugs to treat gastrointestinal motility disorders and pain Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141 :1303-1312 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). The hepatokine FGF21 is a regulator of blood glucose. Several FGF21 mimetics are currently being tested for the treatment of diabetes ( Kuro-O, 2019 43. Kuro-O, M. The Klotho proteins in health and disease Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2019; 15 :27-44 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the receptors for FGF21 are described as a complex of FGFR1 and B-Klotho (KLB), the site of action of FGF21 is debated. We observed broad expression of FGFR1 and KLB by human EECs, suggesting that FGF21 effects could be partially mediated through the gut ( Figure 4 A). Fgfr1 is absent in murine EECs, whereas Klb is expressed at very low levels ( Figure S4 F). We noted an upregulation of multiple hormones after FGF21 treatment, pointing to a potential role of signaling through FGFR1/KLB in EEC function ( Figure S4 G). C10ORF10 (also known as DEPP1 ) was widely expressed by human EECs. This gene is negatively regulated by insulin in liver and adipocyte tissue; its product controls the ratio between ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis ( Li et al., 2018 45. Li, W. ∙ Ji, M. ∙ Lin, Y. ... DEPP/DEPP1/C10ORF10 regulates hepatic glucose and fat metabolism partly via ROS-induced FGF21 FASEB J. 2018; 32 :5459-5469 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A). Finally, LCN15 was produced by NTS + cells ( Figure 4 A). LCN15 is a lipocalin and one of the strongest glucose-regulated genes in Caco-2 cells ( Boztepe and Gulec, 2018 8. Boztepe, T. ∙ Gulec, S. Investigation of the influence of high glucose on molecular and genetic responses: an in vitro study using a human intestine model Genes Nutr. 2018; 13 :11 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although some lipocalins have been implicated in insulin resistance, LCN15’s function remains unknown.
We then focused on unique genes expressed by M/X cells but absent in murine X cells. TRNP1 , involved in cortical folding in the brain ( Stahl et al., 2013 78. Stahl, R. ∙ Walcher, T. ∙ De Juan Romero, C. ... Trnp1 regulates expansion and folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex by control of radial glial fate Cell. 2013; 153 :535-549 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ), was the only transcription factor specific to M/X cells ( Figure 4 B). A putative hormone, precerebellin 1 ( CBLN1 ), was expressed in all M/X cells ( Figure 4 B). CBLN1 stimulates food intake upon intracerebroventricular injection (like GHRE) ( Gardiner et al., 2010 27. Gardiner, J.V. ∙ Beale, K.E. ∙ Roy, D. ... Cerebellin1 is a novel orexigenic peptide Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2010; 12 :883-890 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed CBLN1 expression in human GHRL + cells in vivo using immunofluorescence ( Figure 4 C). We noted that M/X cells expressed the receptor for cytokines of the IL10-family (IL20-RA), an observation confirmed in vivo ( Figures 4 B and 4C). We detected high expression of the peptide hormone angiotensin ( AGT ), a regulator of blood pressure, but also of contraction of the human intestinal musculature (similar to motilin) ( Ewert et al., 2006 21. Ewert, S. ∙ Spak, E. ∙ Olbers, T. ... Angiotensin II induced contraction of rat and human small intestinal wall musculature in vitro Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2006; 188 :33-40 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 B). Finally, M/X cells displayed the highest expression of all EECs of the sulfate transporter SLC26A7 and of T 4 - and retinol-binding transthyretin ( TTR ) ( Figure 4 B). We confirmed the expression of these EEC genes in the (limited) number of single-cell sequenced human ileal EECs ( Figures 4 A and 4B).
To identify heterogeneity among the different EEC subtypes, we subclustered cells sorted from organoids carrying the individual hormone reporters. Expression of the fluorescent reporters directly correlated with the levels of the pertinent hormone transcripts within the same cell ( Figure S5 A). A substantial number of the cells sorted for MLN-reporter expression (yet with low MLN expression) were L cells ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Surprisingly, we identified a rare subcluster of GCG +-reporter cells that highly expressed PPY ( Cox, 2007 14. Cox, H.M. Neuropeptide Y receptors; antisecretory control of intestinal epithelial function Auton. Neurosci. 2007; 133 :76-85 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), a well-described pancreas hormone involved in appetite regulation, never seen in human or mouse small intestine. We confirmed its expression and partial overlap with GLP-1 by staining on human intestinal sections ( Figures S5 B and S5C).
We analyzed expression of transcription factors known from mice to specify individual lineages ( Figure 5 A). PAX4 specifies D/EC cells, whereas expression of ARX promotes all other EEC fates ( Beucher et al., 2012 5. Beucher, A. ∙ Gjernes, E. ∙ Collin, C. ... The homeodomain-containing transcription factors Arx and Pax4 control enteroendocrine subtype specification in mice PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e36449 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), in agreement with our expression profiles. HHEX and LMX1A defined human D and EC lineages respectively, consistent with mouse ( Figure 5 A) ( Gross et al., 2016 32. Gross, S. ∙ Garofalo, D.C. ∙ Balderes, D.A. ... The novel enterochromaffin marker Lmx1a regulates serotonin biosynthesis in enteroendocrine cell lineages downstream of Nkx2.2 Development. 2016; 143 :2616-2628 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). The broad murine EEC transcription factors NKX2-2, PAX6, SOX4, and RFX6 ( Gehart et al., 2019 28. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ... Identification of Enteroendocrine Regulators by Real-Time Single-Cell Differentiation Mapping Cell. 2019; 176 :1158-1173.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) were ubiquitously expressed in human EECs. We additionally identify ASCL1 as a broad human EEC transcription factor, absent from M/X cells and from all mouse EECs ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Ascl1 is expressed in endocrine cells in murine lung ( Borges et al., 1997 7. Borges, M. ∙ Linnoila, R.I. ∙ van de Velde, H.J.K. ... An achaete-scute homologue essential for neuroendocrine differentiation in the lung Nature. 1997; 386 :852-855 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). MNX1 was highly expressed by human ECs; it promotes neonatal diabetes when mutated ( Figures 5 A and 5B) ( Pan et al., 2015 56. Pan, F.C. ∙ Brissova, M. ∙ Powers, A.C. ... Inactivating the permanent neonatal diabetes gene Mnx1 switches insulin-producing β-cells to a γ-like fate and reveals a facultative proliferative capacity in aged β-cells Dev. 2015; 142 :3637-3648 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). MLN + cells developmentally resembled murine Ghrl-producing X cells.
We chose to knock out the EC-specific LMX1A gene and the D-cell-specific HHEX gene ( Figures 5 A and 5C). Organoids were transiently transfected with a Cas9-EGFP coding plasmid that included the site-specific guide RNA (gRNA) ( Ran et al., 2013 63. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7570) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genotyping of clonal organoids was performed to identify homozygous loss-of-function alleles. Lmx1a -null mice die shortly after birth, lacking intestinal Tph1 and Chga expression, indicative of EC loss ( Gross et al., 2016 32. Gross, S. ∙ Garofalo, D.C. ∙ Balderes, D.A. ... The novel enterochromaffin marker Lmx1a regulates serotonin biosynthesis in enteroendocrine cell lineages downstream of Nkx2.2 Development. 2016; 143 :2616-2628 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). LMX1A mutant human organoids displayed a strong reduction in TPH1 ( Figure 5 D). We also observed a milder reduction in SST derived from D cells. In contrast to mouse EECs, human LMX1A is also expressed in D-cells ( Figure 5 A)
HHEX has been linked to type 2 diabetes ( Scott et al., 2007 73. Scott, L.J. ∙ Mohlke, K.L. ∙ Bonnycastle, L.L. ... A genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in finns detects multiple susceptibility variants Science. 2007; 316 :1341-1345 Crossref Scopus (2317) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although loss of Hhex in mice impairs the function of Sst-producing cells in pancreatic islets, effects in the murine intestinal tract were not described ( Zhang et al., 2014 89. Zhang, J. ∙ McKenna, L.B. ∙ Bogue, C.W. ... The diabetes gene Hhex maintains δ-cell differentiation and islet function Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :829-834 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). HHEX gene disruption blocked the production of SST ( Figure 5 D). The most striking increase was observed in GCG expression (over 20-fold). In Hhex -knockout mice, pancreatic glucagon similarly increases ( Zhang et al., 2014 89. Zhang, J. ∙ McKenna, L.B. ∙ Bogue, C.W. ... The diabetes gene Hhex maintains δ-cell differentiation and islet function Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :829-834 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Immunofluorescent staining in HHEX and LMX1A organoids revealed a 4-fold reduction in the number of SST + D cells upon HHEX loss, suggesting impaired allocation of progenitors into this lineage ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Serotonin-producing cells did however not decrease in LMX1A knockout organoids, despite a decline in TPH1 expression ( Figures 5 D–5F). We conclude that LMX1A is not directly important for allocation to the EC fate.
Crypt-villus gradients were observed for human hormones such as GCG ( Figure S5 D). We interrogated BMP dependency of hormone gene expression in the single-cell atlas. BMP activation induced NTS in L cells at the expense of GCG ( Figure S5 E). Live-cell imaging of GCG -reporter organoids confirmed that BMP activation decreased reporter expression in individual L cells ( Figure S5 F). Additionally, we observed BMP-mediated repression of GHRL in M/X cells, accompanied by a mild increase in MLN expression ( Figure S5 E). In murine intestine, we have found that expression of GHRL diminishes with migration of the X cell along the crypt-villus axis ( Gehart et al., 2019 28. Gehart, H. ∙ van Es, J.H. ∙ Hamer, K. ... Identification of Enteroendocrine Regulators by Real-Time Single-Cell Differentiation Mapping Cell. 2019; 176 :1158-1173.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, human MLN/GHRL -producing EECs appeared to undergo a BMP-controlled switch in hormone expression as previously described in mouse.
Transcriptomics of pooled cells has a superior sensitivity compared to single-cell RNA sequencing. We thus generated a deep transcriptomic signature of sorted and pooled EC, L, and M cells ( Figure S6 A). In addition, CHGA-mNeon + cells were sorted to generate a broad EEC signature. We identified the top 20 uniquely expressed markers from the RNA sequencing dataset for each population ( Figure S6 B). We thus uncovered multiple EEC subtype features, unnoticed in the single-cell atlas. The transcription factor IRX3 , member of the Iroquois homeobox family, was one of the most defining markers of TPH1+ cells, yet has not been described in murine EECs ( Haber et al., 2017 34. Haber, A.L. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Rogel, N. ... A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium Nature. 2017; 551 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 B). IRX3 has gained attention as a neuronal regulator of energy balance, and genetic variants in IRX3 associate with obesity in humans ( Schneeberger, 2019 72. Schneeberger, M. Irx3, a new leader on obesity genetics EBioMedicine. 2019; 39 :19-20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We analyzed our bulk transcriptomic datasets for subtype-specific receptors. We noted conserved expression of receptors known from mouse EECs, including FFAR2 (broad EEC), GPBAR1 (L cell), SSTR5 (L cell), OR51E1 (mouse homolog Olfr558 ; EC), ADGRG4 ( Gpr112; EC), and the extracellular calcium sensor CASR (broad EEC) ( Furness et al., 2013 26. Furness, J.B. ∙ Rivera, L.R. ∙ Cho, H.-J. ... The gut as a sensory organ Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10 :729-740 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 C). Human EECs expressed multiple orphan receptors, such as GPR162 (L cells), not found in mice ( Figure S6 C), and reported to be expressed in brain to regulate food intake. Genetic variants in GPR162 are linked to glucose deregulation ( Caruso et al., 2016 10. Caruso, V. ∙ Sreedharan, S. ∙ Carlini, V.P. ... mRNA GPR162 changes are associated with decreased food intake in rat, and its human genetic variants with impairments in glucose homeostasis in two Swedish cohorts Gene. 2016; 581 :139-145 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). GPR68 is an orphan GPCR uniquely expressed by ECs ( Figure S6 C). The orphan peptide CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated protein) activates GPR68 ( Foster et al., 2019 24. Foster, S.R. ∙ Hauser, A.S. ∙ Vedel, L. ... Discovery of Human Signaling Systems: Pairing Peptides to G Protein-Coupled Receptors Cell. 2019; 179 :895-908.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ); it has a role in the regulation of anxiety, reward, and feeding behaviors ( Shcherbina et al., 2018 75. Shcherbina, L. ∙ Lindqvist, A. ∙ Thorén Fischer, A.H. ... Intestinal CART is a regulator of GIP and GLP-1 secretion and expression Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2018; 476 :8-16 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). We find broad expression of the subunit of the GABA-B receptor GABBR2 , potentially allowing a GABA response ( Figure S7 C) ( Hyland and Cryan, 2010 40. Hyland, N.P. ∙ Cryan, J.F. A gut feeling about GABA: Focus on GABAB receptors Front. Pharmacol. 2010; Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified production of multiple hormone receptors in EECs, including the melanocortin receptor MC1R ( Figure S6 C). MC4R in murine L cells is a regulator of hormone secretion and can be activated by MSH-like producing bacteria ( Panaro et al., 2014 57. Panaro, B.L. ∙ Tough, I.R. ∙ Engelstoft, M.S. ... The melanocortin-4 receptor is expressed in enteroendocrine L cells and regulates the release of peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide 1 in vivo Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :1018-1029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). ECs selectively expressed the receptor for the thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSHR ( Figure S6 C). Serotonin regulates thyroid hormone levels ( Sullo et al., 2011 79. Sullo, A. ∙ Brizzi, G. ∙ Maffulli, N. Chronic peripheral administration of serotonin inhibits thyroid function in the rat Muscles Ligaments Tendons J. 2011; 1 :48-50 PubMed Google Scholar ). TSHR expression by ECs suggests that this regulation could work bidirectionally. ECs also expressed the receptor for the L cell hormone PYY, NPY1R ( Figure S6 C), reported in murine enterocytes as a regulator of electrolyte transport ( Goldspink et al., 2018 29. Goldspink, D.A. ∙ Reimann, F. ∙ Gribble, F.M. Models and Tools for Studying Enteroendocrine Cells Endocrinology. 2018; 159 :3874-3884 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not confirm expression of NPY1R in the CHGA-mNeon − population, which includes enterocytes. L cells highly expressed the Sct receptor SCTR as observed in our single-cell atlas but not in mice ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the expression of SCTR in EECs in vivo by overlap with CHGA ( Figure S6 E). Because we observed the highest expression of SCTR in L cells, we measured GLP-1 secretion upon a 24 h secretin treatment in organoids. Indeed, Sct induced GLP-1 secretion at levels comparable to forskolin as measured by ELISA, or as seen by the loss of intracellular fluorescence of GCG-neon ( Figures S6 F–S6H).
We next isolated intracellular proteins for mass spectrometry to establish subtype-specific proteomes ( Figure S6 A). PCA-analysis revealed a clear separation of reporter populations ( Figure S7 A). The analysis confirmed many of the novel markers for EEC populations, including the L cell hormone PPY, EEC marker MIDKINE, and the M cell peptidase CPB1 ( Figure S7 B). A gene identified at RNA level but not in the proteome was CRYBA2 , a crystallin family member ( Figure S7 C), and reported as a marker of human endocrine cells in pancreas and colon ( Muraro et al., 2016; Parikh et al., 2019 53. Muraro, M.J. ∙ Dharmadhikari, G. ∙ Grün, D. ... A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :385-394.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Parikh, K. ∙ Antanaviciute, A. ∙ Fawkner-Corbett, D. ... Colonic epithelial cell diversity in health and inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2019; 567 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRYBA2 protein was also absent on human intestinal sections using immunohistochemistry (IHC) ( Figure S7 D). In the human genome, CRYBA2 maps adjacent to another EEC marker gene, FEV ( Haber et al., 2017 34. Haber, A.L. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Rogel, N. ... A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium Nature. 2017; 551 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRYBA2 and FEV RNAs were expressed in a virtually identical pattern in our single-cell atlas ( Figures S7 C and S7E).
The human EEC organoid cultures uniquely allow proteomic analysis of hormones secreted basolaterally. We isolated supernatants of forskolin-stimulated proximal and distal SI EEC organoids and control organoids, separated into >10kDa and <10kDa fractions. The latter was directly analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), whereas the former was first trypsinised ( Figure 6 A). Proteins secreted by EEC organoids showed a large non-overlap with the bulk proteome of the different EEC populations ( Figure 6 B). These proteins were mainly annotated to extracellular processes such as “secretion” when compared to intracellular proteome ( Figure 6 C). In both the >10kDa and the <10kDa (representing processed hormones) fractions, the expected EEC marker hormones were found among the most abundant proteins and peptides identified ( Figure 6 D). Control organoids (not enriched for EECs) mostly secreted goblet cell products like mucins and trefoil factors. This provided strong evidence for specific hormone processing and secretion by proximal (e.g., GAST, GHRL, MLN, and CCK) and distal (e.g., PYY, NTS and GCG) intestinal organoids.
Hormones known to undergo proteolytic processing were detected in the processed peptides fraction. By contrast, REG4 (biologically active as a full-length protein) was only found in the >10kDa fraction ( Figure 7 A). Processed peptides generally displayed C-terminal trimming, likely due to the endogenous activity of carboxypeptidases ( Figures 7 B and S7 F). All known fragments of the proglucagon pro-hormone were observed ( Figure S7 F). Individual fragments rarely spanned more than a single biologically active peptide. Neuronostatin, a fragment of the pro-somatostatin hormone ( Vainio et al., 2012 84. Vainio, L. ∙ Perjes, A. ∙ Ryti, N. ... Neuronostatin, a novel peptide encoded by somatostatin gene, regulates cardiac contractile function and cardiomyocyte survival J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :4572-4580 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), was found abundantly in the EEC secretome ( Figure S7 F). Processed peptides were biased toward bioactive fragments of multiple hormones and enzymes, including for MLN, PCSK1N, and GHRL ( Figures 7 B and S7 F). The signal peptide (20–25 N-terminal amino acids of the prohormones) was consistently cleaved from all hormones ( Figures 7 B and S7 F). Apart from quantitative differences, we also detected region-specific biases in the ratio between bioactive peptides and those with no known activity. For example, duodenal bioactive peptides from proximal-enriched hormones (GHRL, MLN) were highly overrepresented.
Next, we looked for peptides not shown to be secreted from EECs before. CHGA codes for a 457-amino acid preproprotein, cleaved into many different bioactive products. A shorter second isoform lacks exon 6 and has not been shown to be translated ( Loh et al., 2012 47. Loh, Y.P. ∙ Cheng, Y. ∙ Mahata, S.K. ... Chromogranin A and derived peptides in health and disease J. Mol. Neurosci. 2012; 48 :347-356 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). We now find abundant peptides spanning exon 5 and exon 7 ( Figures 7 A and 7C). Consistent with the observed RNA expression, other previously unknown EEC products were also observed ( Figures 4 A and S7 ). These include NPW, MIDKINE, VGF, and the peptidase CPB1 ( Figures 7 A and 7D). We found expression and secretion of the antimicrobial peptide REG3A from human EECs ( Figures 7 A and S7 F). We further identified EEC-specific secretion of the enzyme PAM (peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase), which activates endocrine peptides by C-terminal amidation ( Figures 7 A and S7 F). Coding variants of PAM are associated with type 2 diabetes and can affect insulin secretion ( Thomsen et al., 2018 81. Thomsen, S.K. ∙ Raimondo, A. ∙ Hastoy, B. ... Type 2 diabetes risk alleles in PAM impact insulin release from human pancreatic β-cells Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :1122-1131 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). We detected the nucleobindin-2 (NUC2B) precursor, processed to the neuropeptides nesfatin-1, -2, and -3 ( Ramesh et al., 2015 62. Ramesh, N. ∙ Mortazavi, S. ∙ Unniappan, S. Nesfatin-1 stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide secretion from STC-1 cells in vitro Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nesfatin-1 has recently gained attention as an anorexigenic and insulinotropic peptide, produced in the hypothalamus and pancreas. Nesfatin-1 has been shown to regulate GLP-1 and GIP secretion in vitro ( Ramesh et al., 2015 62. Ramesh, N. ∙ Mortazavi, S. ∙ Unniappan, S. Nesfatin-1 stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide secretion from STC-1 cells in vitro Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Section: Discussion

Human EECs are rare and have been largely inaccessible for in vitro studies. We have generated a high-resolution transcriptomic and proteomic profile of human EECs from three locations along the gastrointestinal tract, including a first assessment of their secreted products. This dataset yields new hormones, transcription factors, and receptors and can be mined for novel therapeutic targets. The expression atlas highlights key differences with mouse. The transcriptional networks generating the different EEC subtypes have been well worked out in mice ( Beucher et al., 2012; Gehart et al., 2019; Gross et al., 2016; Piccand et al., 2019 5.

Metab. 2019; 29 :24-39 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). These networks could result from a stochastically acting system that generates fixed ratios of different EECs. This would explain why organoids generate conserved ratios of EEC subtypes when compared to their tissue of origin ( Beumer et al., 2018 6. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent study has surveyed a broad human EEC population using antibody-based sorting approaches and bulk RNA sequencing ( Roberts et al., 2019 65. Roberts, G.P. ∙ Larraufie, P. ∙ Richards, P. ... Comparison of human and murine enteroendocrine cells by transcriptomic and peptidomic profiling Diabetes. 2019; 68 :1062-1072 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ) and identified EEC features, such as the expression of neuropeptide W, confirmed by the current study.
We present the first transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of MLN-producing cells. MLN is a regulator of gut motility with intriguing evolutionary dynamics, inactivated independently in lineages leading to the mouse and rat, and guinea pigs ( He et al., 2010 36. He, J. ∙ Irwin, D.M. ∙ Chen, R. ... Stepwise loss of motilin and its specific receptor genes in rodents J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 44 :37-44 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MLN receptor underwent a similar fate ( He et al., 2010 36. He, J. ∙ Irwin, D.M. ∙ Chen, R. ... Stepwise loss of motilin and its specific receptor genes in rodents J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 44 :37-44 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises questions as to how the cell type (the X cell) that produces MLN diverged from that point. For example, the production of a certain hormone is likely to be accompanied by the expression of dedicated sensory receptors. We found many similarities between mouse X cells and the human counterparts, M/X cells. Transcription factors are conserved ( Figure 5 A), as is expression of genes required for GHRL modifications such as Acsl1 ( Figures 3 C and 3D). We noted important differences also, like the expression of putative hormones including CBLN1 and AGT . The latter has been proposed as motility regulator similar to MLN ( Figure 4 ). We also identify a cytokine receptor in M/X cells, IL-20RA , which could link a sensory mechanism for pathogens to an expelling motility response.
The expression of receptors for some EEC hormones by EECs has been reported in mouse, particularly for SST (e.g., Sstr5 in L cells) ( Chisholm and Greenberg, 2002 12. Chisholm, C. ∙ Greenberg, G.R. Somatostatin-28 regulates GLP-1 secretion via somatostatin receptor subtype 5 in rat intestinal cultures Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283 :E311-E317 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). We now find that human EECs can sense extracellular PYY (NPY1R) and Sct (SCTR). The PYY-receptor Npy1r has been suggested as an enterocyte marker in mouse, which we do not confirm in human ( Goldspink et al., 2018 29. Goldspink, D.A. ∙ Reimann, F. ∙ Gribble, F.M. Models and Tools for Studying Enteroendocrine Cells Endocrinology. 2018; 159 :3874-3884 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rather, we observe exclusive expression in human serotonin-producing ECs. SCTR expression is low in ECs and enriched in EECs producing GCG and GAST/GIP . We show that Sct can stimulate L cells to secrete GLP-1. Importantly, a Sct stimulation test is commonly used in diagnostics of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients that suffer from gastrin-producing tumors ( Berna et al., 2006 4. Berna, M.J. ∙ Hoffmann, K.M. ∙ Long, S.H. ... Serum gastrin in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: II. Prospective study of gastrin provocative testing in 293 patients from the National Institutes of Health and comparison with 537 cases from the literature. evaluation of diagnostic criteria, proposal of new criteria, and correlations with clinical and tumoral features Medicine (Baltimore). 2006; 85 :331-364 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sct normally represses blood gastrin by inhibiting the secretion of GAST from stomach G cells (the major site of GAST production), likely through modulating the luminal pH. Patients suffering from SI gastrinoma show sharp increases in serum GAST upon Sct administration. Our data suggest this to occur through SCTR expression by SI GAST-producing G cells. More broadly, our data indicate that human EECs have an extensive capacity to cross-communicate through their hormone products.
Taken together, the EEC atlas and EEC-TAG biobank represent rich resources to identify regulators of human EEC development and function.

Tissues from the human duodenum, ileum and colon were obtained from the UMC Utrecht with informed consent of each patient. All patients were males that were diagnosed with small intestinal or colon adenocarcinoma that was resected. A sample from non-transformed, normal mucosa was taken for this study. The study was approved by the UMC Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands) ethical committee and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and according to Dutch law. This study is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations regarding research involving human participants.
For immunostainings, sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded human intestinal tissue were obtained from resections performed at the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. Anonymized archival pathology material was used according to the guidelines of the UMC Utrecht’s Research Ethics Committee ( Coebergh et al., 2006 13. Coebergh, J.W.W. ∙ van Veen, E.B. ∙ Vandenbroucke, J.P. ... One-time general consent for research on biological samples: opt out system for patients is optimal and endorsed in many countries BMJ. 2006; 332 :665 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Human small intestinal cells were isolated, processed and cultured as described previously ( Beumer et al., 2018; Sato et al., 2011 6. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Sato, T. ∙ Stange, D.E. ∙ Ferrante, M. ... Long-term expansion of epithelial organoids from human colon, adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and Barrett’s epithelium Gastroenterology. 2011; 141 :1762-1772 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2523) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead of Wnt conditioned media, the medium was supplemented with Wnt surrogate (0,15 nM, U-Protein Express). Ileal organoids were splitted on average every 10 days, duodenal and colon organoids ever 7 days. For passaging, organoids were removed from the BME using ice-cold AdDMEM/F12 (GIBCO) and mechanically dissociated into small fragments using a Pasteur pipette. Fragments were replated in fresh BME.
For differentiation toward EECs, organoids were treated with 1 μg/mL doxycycline (Sigma) in ‘ENR’ medium ( Sato et al., 2009 69. Sato, T. ∙ Vries, R.G. ∙ Snippert, H.J. ... Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche Nature. 2009; 459 :262-265 Crossref Scopus (4872) PubMed Google Scholar ). Secretin (Tocris) was used at a concentration of 10 μg/mL. Beta-ionone (Sigma) was used at 100 mg/mL. BMP activation was achieved by withdrawing Noggin from ‘ENR’ and addition of BMP-2 (Peprotech, 50 ng/mL) and BMP-4 (Peprotech, 50 ng/mL). Notch signaling was inhibited by treatment with the Gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Sigma, 10 μM). Wnt inhibition was performed by treatment with the Porcupine inhibitor IWP-2 (StemCell Technologies, Inc., 5 μM). FGF21 was used at a concentration of 1 μg/mL (Peprotech).
The NEUROG3 was cloned in a two insert Gibson reaction into BSKS II vector. Of note, two PCR reactions were done: first, NEUROG3 was amplified from human genomic DNA, since the entire coding region lies in one exon. Second, the BSKS vector was amplified. The forward and reverse primers for Gly linker, FLAG, HA and P2A sequence were annealing to each other ( Table S1 ). All three DNA fragments were then combined in BSKS-NEUROG3-Flag-HA-P2A. In the next step, NEUROG3-P2A sequence was excised using EcoRI enzyme and cloned into previously published pLX-NS2 vector ( Sachs et al., 2019 66. Sachs, N. ∙ Papaspyropoulos, A. ∙ Zomer-van Ommen, D.D. ... Long-term expanding human airway organoids for disease modeling EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e100300 Crossref Scopus (553) PubMed Google Scholar ). Organoids were lentivirally transduced as described before ( Koo et al., 2011 42. Koo, B.K. ∙ Stange, D.E. ∙ Sato, T. ... Controlled gene expression in primary Lgr5 organoid cultures Nat. Methods. 2011; 9 :81-83 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lentiviral transduction was performed on small clumps of cells (2-10 cells) rather than single cells, achieved after TryplE (TrypLE Express; Life Technologies) dissociation.
For generation of the reporter organoid lines using CRISPR-HOT, we utilized a method described in ( Artegiani et al., 2020 1. Artegiani, B. ∙ Hendriks, D. ∙ Beumer, J. ... Fast and efficient generation of knock-in human organoids using homology-independent CRISPR-Cas9 precision genome editing Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :321-331 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we used a targeting plasmid containing a fluorescent protein (mNEON or tdTomato) which can be linearized at a defined base position by a specific sgRNA and Cas9 provided from a second plasmid, which also encodes mCherry ( Schmid-Burgk et al., 2016 71. Schmid-Burgk, J.L. ∙ Höning, K. ∙ Ebert, T.S. ... CRISPaint allows modular base-specific gene tagging using a ligase-4-dependent mechanism Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12338 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). These two plasmids are co-electroporated with a plasmid encoding the sgRNA for the respective locus ( Table S1 ).
The HDR donor plasmid allows C-terminal knock-in of the fluorescent reporter mClover3 in the TPH1 locus and was generated using pUC118 as a backbone. First, the endogenous SapI site in PUC118 was inactivated. Then, a selection cassette (PGK promoter driven expression of blasticidin) flanked by LoxP and two SapI sites was cloned into the SapI-inactivated pUC118 using infusion cloning (638910, Takara). Subsequently, a P2A sequence and the fluorescent protein mClover3 was PCR amplified (Phusion High fidelity DNA polymerase, M0530S, NEB) from the Addgene plasmid #74252 and cloned upstream of the selection cassette using infusion cloning (638910, Takara) and NotI (R0189S, NEB) digestion of the pUC118 selection-cassette containing plasmid. Next, homology arms corresponding to the genomic regions, approximately 1000bp, upstream and downstream of the TPH1 stop codon were PCR amplified (Phusion High fidelity DNA polymerase, M0530S, NEB) from genomic DNA (extracted and purified from human small intestinal organoid DNA). The PCR primers contained overhangs allowing subsequent Golden Gate cloning ( Table S1 ).
The PCR amplified homology arms were purified (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, 28104, QIAGEN) and finally, the targeting vector was generated by SapI (R0569S, NEB) mediated Golden Gate insertion of the homology arms into the pUC118 selection-cassette containing plasmid.
The sgRNA was selected based on the WTSI website ( https://wge.stemcell.sanger.ac.uk// ) and chosen as close to the TPH1 stop codon as possible. The gRNA sequence overlapped with the stop codon, so that the homology vector was not cut. The target sequence was ordered as two complementary oligos (IDT) and cloned in the Cas9-EGFP vector (addgene plasmid #48138) following the protocol described before ( Ran et al., 2013 63. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7570) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the generation of HHEX and LMX1A knockout organoids, gRNAs were selected using the WTSI website and cloned in the Cas9-EGFP vector (addgene plasmid #48138) following the protocol described before ( Ran et al., 2013 63. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7570) PubMed Google Scholar ). gRNAs used in this story are presented in Table S1 .
Human intestinal organoids were transiently transfected using a NEPA21 electroporator and a previously developed protocol ( Fujii et al., 2015 25. Fujii, M. ∙ Matano, M. ∙ Nanki, K. ... Efficient genetic engineering of human intestinal organoids using electroporation Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :1474-1485 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). For electroporation, organoids were dissociated into small clumps of cells (2-10 cells) and washed twice with Optimem. The resulting pellet was resuspended in BTXpress solution (BTX) with 15 μg of plasmids, after which electroporation was performed. 3-7 days after electroporation, either mCherry (for generation of NHEJ-mediated reporter organoids) or EGFP (for generation of HHEX and LMX1A knockout lines) positive cells were sorted using a FACS-ARIA (BD Biosciences). Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632 dihydrochloride; 10 μM, Abmole) was added to the culture medium up to 1 week after sorting to enhance single cell outgrowth. All reporter organoids were generated in organoid lines also transduced with NEUROG3- overexpression (with or without dTomato) vector.
For generation of CRISPR-HOT reporter organoids: Cells were transfected 1) with a gRNA targeting the hormone locus near its stop codon, 2) a vector encoding mNeon or tdTomato and 3) a vector encoding Cas9, a constitutively produced mCherry fluorescent molecule and a gRNA linearizing the vector encoding the fluorescent molecule. Five days later, transfected cells were sorted for mCherry and plated as single cells. After two weeks, NEUROG3 was induced in the resulting clonal organoids to visualize expression of the fluorescent fusion hormones. Typically, the first fluorescent organoids appeared 2-3 days later and were then clonally expanded. Organoids where fluorescent cells appeared during EEC differentiation were picked, digested using TrypLE (TryplE Express; Life Technologies) and clonally expanded to establish stable knock-in organoid lines.
Organoids grown from Cas9-EGFP transfected cells were genotyped for HHEX and LMX1A to confirm homozygous frameshift mutation (primers in Table S1 ).
A red calcium probe (pTorPE-R-GECO1, addgene plasmid #32465) was used as a template to engineer a cyan genetically encoded calcium probe. The cpApple was replaced with a circular permuted mTurquoise. The resulting probe was dubbed Tq-Ca-FLITS (Turquoise Calcium Fluorescence Lifetime Indicator for Truthful Sensing). A triple nuclear localization signal (3xnls) was added to the N terminus of the calcium probe to simplify analysis. Details of the engineering and characterization will be described elsewhere (van der Linden et al., unpublished).
PCRs were performed on Tq-Ca-FLITS (Fw AAACAAGCGGGAGACGTGGAGGAAAACCCTGGACCTCTCGAGatgggatcagatccaaaaaagaagag, Rev ATGGCACTAGGCTAGTTCTAGAcCTACTTCGCTGTCATCATTTGGAC) as well as H2B-mMaroon (Fw TCGGCGCGCCACGCGT, Rev CGTCTCCCGCTTGTTTCAGTAGACTAAAATTCGTCGCGCCAGATCCGCTAGCattaagtttgtgcccc) and the two PCRs were cloned into a lentiviral vector using InPhusion Cloning (Takara), to produce H2B-mMaroon-P2A- Tq-Ca-FLITS, two simultaneously expressed cistrons separated by a de-optimized P2A ( Lo et al., 2015 46. Lo, C.A. ∙ Kays, I. ∙ Emran, F. ... Quantification of Protein Levels in Single Living Cells Cell Rep. 2015; 13 :2634-2644 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ).
H2B-mMaroon-P2A-Tq-Ca-FLITS organoids were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with Argon laser and White Light Laser, the latter allowing spectral flexibility for optimal visualization of all fluorophores. For cell type identification, cells were first imaged in 5 channels (Tq-Ca-FLITS-mTurquoise2, Clover, TdTomato, H2B-Maroon and transmitted light) and subsequently Tq-Ca-FLITS and H2B-mMaroon were time lapse imaged during administration of beta-ionone in XYZT-mode. Post-acquisitional analysis was done with custom-made Fiji-script.
Organoids were fixed with 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer. They were kept in the fixative for 24 h at 4°C. Then, they were washed with 0.1M cacodylate buffer and potsfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer containing 1.5% potassium ferricyanide for 1 h (dark) at 4°C. Then the samples were dehydrated in ethanol, infiltrated with Epon resin for 2 days, embedded in the same resin and polymerized at 60°C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections were obtained using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna) and mounted on Formvar-coated copper grids. They were stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water and lead citrate. Then, sections were observed in a Tecnai T12 electron microscope equipped with an Eagle 4kx4k CCD camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific, the Netherlands).
Alternatively, organoids were chemically fixed at 4°C with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PB buffer. After washing with PB containing 50 mM glycine, cells were embedding in 12% gelatine and infused in 2.3 M sucrose. Mounted gelatine blocks were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thin sections were prepared in an ultracryomicrotome (Leica EM Ultracut UC6/FC6, Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria). Ultrathin cryosections were collected with 2% methylcellulose in 2.3 M sucrose. The observations were performed in an Electron Microscope Tecnai T12 as mentioned.
Organoids were stained as described before ( Beumer et al., 2018 6. Beumer, J. ∙ Artegiani, B. ∙ Post, Y. ... Enteroendocrine cells switch hormone expression along the crypt-to-villus BMP signalling gradient Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :909-916 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, organoids were removed from the BME using ice-cold AdDMEM/F12 (GIBCO), after which these were fixed in formalin for at least 2 h at room temperature. Next, the organoids were washed and blocked for at least 15 min in 2% donkey serum in PBS. After blocking, the cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for at least 15 min. Primary antibodies used were goat anti-chromogranin A (1:500; Santa Cruz), goat anti-cholestocystokin (sc-21617,1:100; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-neurotensin (sc-20806,1:100; Santa Cruz), goat anti-somatostatin (sc-7819, 1:100; Santa Cruz), goat anti-serotonin (ab66047, 1:1,000, Abcam), rabbit anti-gastric inhibitory polypeptide (ab22624-50, 1:500; Abcam), goat anti-GLP1 (sc-7782, 1:100; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-GLP1 (ab22625, 1:200; Abcam), rabbit anti-MLN (HPA069392, 1:200, Atlas antibodies), mouse anti-Gastrin (60346, 1:200, Proteintech), mouse anti beta-Catenin (610154, 1:100; BD transduction laboratories), goat anti-Ghrelin (sc-10368, 1:200; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Neuropeptide W (NBP2-57337, 1:100; Novus), rabbit anti-Precerebellin (ABN304, 1:100; Sigma) and rabbit anti-PPY (HPA032122, 1:200; Atlas antibodies). Organoids were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies Alexa488-, 568- and 647-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-goat (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer containing 4ʹ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1;1,000, Invitrogen). Sections were embedded in Vectashield (Vector Labs) and imaged using a Sp8 confocal microscope (Leica). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software.
FISH was performed using the RNAScope® Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Wang et al., 2012 85. Wang, F. ∙ Flanagan, J. ∙ Su, N. ... RNAscope: a novel in situ RNA analysis platform for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues J. Mol. Diagn. 2012; 14 :22-29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1768) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, paraffin embedded ileal surgical sections were deparaffinized, treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and boiled in target retrieval buffer for 15 min before a 30-min protease treatment. Probes directed against CHGA/SCTR, CHGA/GCG and GHRL/ IL20RA were multiplexed, respectively, amplified and detected using fluorescent probes based on opal dyes. Slides were counterstained with DAPI for 30 s, mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher scientific) and images were obtained using a SP8 confocal fluorescent microscope (Leica).
The supernatant from organoids either cultured in ENR for 5 days or differentiated toward EECs were collected after a 24 h stimulation with 10 μM forskolin (Tocris). GLP-1 concentration was measured using a GLP-1 EIA kit (Rab0201 from Sigma that detects both full-length and N-terminal cleaved GLP-1) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Organoid RNA was isolated using a RNAeasy kit (QIAGEN), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed using biological and technical duplicates as described described before ( Muñoz et al., 2012 52. Muñoz, J. ∙ Stange, D.E. ∙ Schepers, A.G. ... The Lgr5 intestinal stem cell signature: robust expression of proposed quiescent '+4′ cell markers EMBO J. 2012; 31 :3079-3091 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ). Primers were designed using the NCBI primer design tool, tested using a standard curve, and are presented in Table S1 .
Human intestinal mucosal biopsies were obtained from patients undergoing colonoscopy at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK. All patients gave informed consent for extra biopsy samples to be taken for research use when undergoing elective colonoscopy (REC 17/EE/0265). Only those patients with a macroscopically normal mucosa and subsequent histological confirmation of a normal mucosa with no intestinal pathology were included in this study.
Once acquired, biopsies were immediately placed into Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and washed three times in fresh HBSS. Biopsies were then placed into an HBSS solution containing 1.07 Wünsch units/mL Liberase DH (Roche) and 70 U/mL hyaluronidase (Merck) and incubated at 37°C for 15 min while on a plate shaker at 750 rpm. The samples were then mechanically disrupted by pipetting the solution up and down using a p1000 pipette, and then incubated at 37°C for a further 15 min on a plate-shaker at 750rpm. The samples were then washed three times by pelleting the cells using centrifugation at 400 g for 4 min, removal of the supernatant and resuspending in DMEM/F12 (Thermofisher). On the third wash the cells were left in suspension, and a 10 μL aliquot was placed into a Countess ® Automated Cell Counter to estimate the cellular concentration.
3,000 cells suspended in DMEM/F12 (Thermofisher) were loaded into an individual channel of a 10x single cell chip as per the manufacturer’s protocol (version 2, 3′) and run in standard conditions by the chromium controller (10X genomics). cDNA libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced on an Illumina Hi-seq 4000 (2x50bp paired-end reads).
Raw sequence reads in FASTQ format were aligned to the human transcriptome GRCh38-1.2.0 using Cellranger v2.1.1(10x Genomics) with default parameters. Scanpy v1.4 ( Wolf et al., 2018 86. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (2665) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for data processing, quality control and dimensionality reduction. We excluded cells with less than 200 genes and genes expressed in fewer than 3 cells. After quality control, the dataset contained 11,302 cells. EECs were identified and subclustered based on the expression of at least 10 CHGA counts per cell. “
Organoids were dissociated to single cells using a 10-min incubation with TrypLE (TrypLE Express; Life Technologies) and repeated mechanical disruption by pipetting. Cells were sorted using a BD FACS Aria (BD Biosciences) based on fluorescence levels. For single cell RNA sequencing, individual cells were collected in 384-well plates with ERCC spike-ins (Agilent), reverse transcription primers and dNTPs (both Promega). Single cell sequencing was performed according to the Sort-seq method ( Muraro et al., 2016 53. Muraro, M.J. ∙ Dharmadhikari, G. ∙ Grün, D. ... A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :385-394.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequencing libraries were generated with TruSeq small RNA primers (Illumina) and sequenced paired-end at 60 and 26 bp read length, respectively, on the Illumina NextSeq.
For bulk RNA sequencing, cells were sorted into Eppendorf tubes containing RLT buffer (RNeasy kit, QIAGEN). 5,000 – 30,000 cells were sorted per reporter in duplicates (and triplicates for tdTomato negative cells). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing libraries were generated using a modified CELseq2 protocol ( Hashimshony et al., 2016 35. Hashimshony, T. ∙ Senderovich, N. ∙ Avital, G. ... CEL-Seq2: sensitive highly-multiplexed single-cell RNA-Seq Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :77 Crossref Scopus (698) PubMed Google Scholar ). 75 bp paired-end sequencing of libraries was performed on an Illumina NextSeq platform.
Reads were mapped to the human GRCh37 genome assembly. Sort-seq read counts were filtered to exclude reads with identical library-, cell- and molecule barcodes. UMI counts were adjusted using Poisson counting statistics ( Muraro et al., 2016 53. Muraro, M.J. ∙ Dharmadhikari, G. ∙ Grün, D. ... A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :385-394.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells with fewer than 2,000 unique transcripts were excluded from further analysis. The remaining cells in the EEC atlas were derived from the following sources: 1446 cells from duodenum, 2145 cells from ileum, 690 cells from colon.
Subsequently, RaceID3 was used for k-medoids based clustering (knn = 10) of cells and differential gene expression analysis between clusters using the standard settings described at https://github.com/dgrun/RaceID3_StemID2_package .
The dataset was then subsetted to require expression of EEC markers and exclude cells based on expression of markers of other cell types with the following transcript count cutoffs: CHGA > 5; MUC2 < 5; FABP1 < 15; LYZ < 15; OLFM4 < 10. The resulting set of EECs was again subjected to clustering (knn = 5) and differential gene expression as described above.
For reporter analyses, cells sorted by fluorescent reporter positivity were analyzed as one dataset per reporter to gain more detailed insights into single EEC subpopulations. The following deviations from standard settings were made per reporter: GCG: knn = 5; outlg = 1; probthr = 0.00001; perplexity = 10; MLN: knn = 10; probthr = 0.0000001; SST: knn = 10; perplexity = 20
For mouse validation, the tissue-derived single cell count tables from Gehart el al. (2019) were reanalyzed using the procedure and settings described above. No subsetting for EECs was performed.
Reads were mapped to the human GRCh37 genome assembly. The counted reads were filtered to exclude reads with identical library- and molecule barcodes. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package ( Love et al., 2014 49. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45393) PubMed Google Scholar ). For display in heatmaps, genes were ranked by fold change compared against tdTomato negative cells. After filtering for an adjusted p value < 0.05, the row z-score for the top 20 genes was calculated.
Organoids differentiated for 5 days to EECs were washed extensively in PBS and stimulated with 10 μM forskolin (Tocris). Conditioned media was collected for 24 h and supplemented with 1x cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail on harvest (Roche). Potential cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g , for 5 min at 4°C. Conditioned media supernatant was denatured in final 4 M Urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and fractionated by molecular weight with a 10 kDa Vivaspin centrifugal device (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany), at 12,000 x g , for 10 min at 4°C. (i) Endogenously processed peptides recovered from the filtrate were acidified to 5% formic acid, desalted by reversed phase C18 1cc columns (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA), further purified by home-made strong cation exchange STAGE tip, and dried by vacuum centrifugation. (ii) Longer secreted proteins in the 10 kDa retentate were recovered and diluted to final 2 M Urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, for reduction with dithiothreitol, alkylation with iodoacetamide, and overnight digestion with trypsin (Promega, Madison, USA) at 37°C. Digested peptides were similarly acidified to 5% formic acid, desalted by reversed phase C18 1 cc columns (Waters), and dried by vacuum centrifugation.
FACS sorted enteroendocrine cells were lysed in 8M Urea, 50 mM Ammonium bicarbonate, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor, 50 μg/mL DNase I, and sonicated with the Biorupter (3 cycles, 20 s on, 20 s off at 4°C) (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 1 h at 15°C, and supernatant containing extracted proteins were reduced, alkylated, diluted 4 times with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and digested sequentially with Lys-C (Wako) and trypsin (Promega). Peptide digests were quenched to 5% formic acid, and sodium deoxycholate was precipitated and removed by centrifugation at 14,000 x g, 4°C for 10 min. Peptides in the supernatant were diluted to final 20% acetonitrile and purified by SCX STAGE tips. Eluted peptides were dried by vacuum centrifugation.
Peptides were reconstituted in 2% FA for LC-MS injection. Data was acquired using an UHPLC 1290 system (Agilent, California, USA) coupled to an Orbitrap HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Massachussets, USA). Peptides were first trapped in a 2 cm × 100 μM Reprosil C18 trap column (Dr Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) of 3 μM pore size for 5 min in solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water). After trapping, samples separated in an analytical column (Agilent Poroshell, EC-C18, 2.7 μm, 50 cm × 75 μm) using a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile (solvent B). Depending on total peptide input, species complexity, and elution profiles, different LC gradient lengths were used for FACS-sorted whole proteomes (35min, 13%–40% solvent B), secreted proteins (65min, 13%–40% solvent B) and endogenously processed peptides (95min, 13%–44% solvent B). MS acquisition was performed in data-dependent mode. Full scans (MS1) were acquired from 375 to 1600 m/z at resolution 60,000, with 20 ms injection time and 3x10 6 AGC target value. The TOP 15 most intense precursor ions where selected for fragmentation using 1.4 m/z isolation window. Isolated precursors were fragmented using high energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) at normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27%. MS2 scans were acquired at resolution 30,000, with 50 ms injection time and an AGC target value of 1x10 5 . Exclusion times were set to 8, 12 or 16 s for proteomics, digested retentates and endogenously processed peptides respectively.LC-MS injection loads were adjusted to the sample of least quantity, such that all LC-MS measurements to be compared were matched in TIC intensity.
Collected spectral data was processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.3 (Thermo Scientific, Massachussets, USA), and searched using Sequest HT search engine, against UniProt Homo sapiens database (173235 entries, downloaded in August 2019, including common contaminants). Precursor and fragment mass tolerance were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da respectively. Protein N-terminal Acetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. For the endogenously processed peptides, peptides of length 6 - 50 amino acids were generated from the database upon unspecific cleavage. For digested retentates and analyses of the FACS-sorted EECs proteomes, cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification and up to 2 missed trypsin cleavages were allowed. Identified peptides were filtered to 1% FDR using the Percolator algorithm ( The et al., 2016 80. The, M. ∙ MacCoss, M.J. ∙ Noble, W.S. ... Fast and Accurate Protein False Discovery Rates on Large-Scale Proteomics Data Sets with Percolator 3.0 J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2016; 27 :1719-1727 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In proteome analyses, intensities of proteins detected in 2 out of 3 replicates in at least one group were log(2) transformed and missing values were imputed from the normal distribution independently for each sample using Perseus software (v_1.6.2.2)( Tyanova et al., 2016 83. Tyanova, S. ∙ Temu, T. ∙ Sinitcyn, P. ... The Perseus computational platform for comprehensive analysis of (prote)omics data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :731-740 Crossref Scopus (4646) PubMed Google Scholar ). Processed data was assessed for statistical significance among the groups using One-way ANOVA or Student’s t test, and resulting p-value s were corrected for type I error using Benjamini-Hochberg approach (q-value). Tukey Honest Significant Difference test was performed to assess difference between the groups when required. Hormone processing plots were generated from peptides identified at high confidence (1% FDR) in at least 2 out of 3 replicates. For novel secreted products, peptides identified in 3 out of 3 replicates and not observed in the secretome of control organoids were used. Peptide sequences identified based on retention time alignment (not supported by spectral evidence) were not used in hormone processing plots. Statistical analysis and plots were generated using in-house built R scripts (R version 3.6.0). Gene ontology enrichments were performed with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.8 ( Huang et al., 2009 39. Huang, W. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Lempicki, R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :44-57 Crossref Scopus (27554) PubMed Google Scholar ), using all the proteins identified in the bulk EEC proteome as reference list.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to the sample allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), unless stated otherwise. Value of n is always displayed in the figure as individual data points, and in the legends. Statistical tests included unpaired two-tailed t test for Figures 5 F and Figure S1 G.
