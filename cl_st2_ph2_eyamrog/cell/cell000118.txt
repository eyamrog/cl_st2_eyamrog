Title: Cancer Burden Is Controlled by Mural Cell-β3-Integrin Regulated Crosstalk with Tumor Cells


Abstract: Summary

Enhanced blood vessel (BV) formation is thought to drive tumor growth through elevated nutrient delivery. However, this observation has overlooked potential roles for mural cells in directly affecting tumor growth independent of BV function. Here we provide clinical data correlating high percentages of mural-β3-integrin-negative tumor BVs with increased tumor sizes but no effect on BV numbers. Mural-β3-integrin loss also enhances tumor growth in implanted and autochthonous mouse tumor models with no detectable effects on BV numbers or function. At a molecular level, mural-cell β3-integrin loss enhances signaling via FAK-p-HGFR-p-Akt-p-p65, driving CXCL1, CCL2, and TIMP-1 production. In particular, mural-cell-derived CCL2 stimulates tumor cell MEK1-ERK1/2-ROCK2-dependent signaling and enhances tumor cell survival and tumor growth. Overall, our data indicate that mural cells can control tumor growth via paracrine signals regulated by β3-integrin, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism of cancer growth control.

Section: Introduction

The precise mechanisms underlying the role of tumor stromal cells in cancer growth are still unclear. In solid cancers, blood vessels are essential for the delivery of nutrients and oxygen ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011 30. Hanahan, D. ∙ Weinberg, R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation Cell. 2011; 144 :646-674 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49637) PubMed Google Scholar ). Formation of new tumor blood vessels, tumor angiogenesis, involves enhanced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, development of a vessel basement membrane, and subsequent recruitment of supporting mural cells including pericytes ( Chung et al., 2010 13. Chung, A.S. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Ferrara, N. Targeting the tumour vasculature: insights from physiological angiogenesis Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10 :505-514 Crossref Scopus (660) PubMed Google Scholar ). These cellular processes are thought to require changes in cell adhesion. The cell adhesion receptor integrin αvβ3 is upregulated in nascent tumor blood vessels in both endothelial cells and pericytes, suggesting a functional role of this integrin in tumor angiogenesis. Importantly, despite strong preclinical data and the fact that potent β3-integrin inhibitors are now under development, previous strategies to target β3-integrin as anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer strategies have failed in clinical trials ( Mason, 2015; Tucci et al., 2014 38.

This is most likely because a deeper understanding of the role of this integrin in tumor blood vessels and tumor biology is still required. Although β3-integrin in endothelial cells has been studied extensively ( Brooks et al., 1994a, 1994b, 1995; Reynolds et al., 2002, 2009;Steri et al., 2014; Stupp and Ruegg, 2007 6.

Pericytes are generally recognized for being able to cross-talk with endothelial cells and regulate blood vessel leakage ( Armulik et al., 2011; Raza et al., 2010; Stratman et al., 2009 2.

However, the correlation of pericyte abundance in controlling cancer growth and progression is still unclear ( Caspani et al., 2014; Cooke et al., 2012; Furuhashi et al., 2004; O’Keeffe et al., 2008; Sinha et al., 2016 11.

Recent studies have revealed that tumor endothelial cells can produce angiocrine factors, endothelium-derived factors that can regulate tumor growth and chemosensitivity ( Acharyya et al., 2012; Brantley-Sieders et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2014, 2017; Ghajar et al., 2013; Ghiabi et al., 2014; Gilbert and Hemann, 2010; Lu et al., 2013; Pedrosa et al., 2015; Tavora et al., 2014; Wieland et al., 2017 1.

For example, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling and its control of endothelial cell-derived cytokine production has been implicated in cancer progression and chemosensitivity ( Acharyya et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2014, 2017; Gilbert and Hemann, 2010; Tavora et al., 2014 1.

Similar roles for paracrine signals derived from pericytes were hitherto less well studied.
Our findings suggest a concept where direct cross-talk between mural cells and tumor cells promotes cancer growth and that this is controlled by mural cell-β3-integrin.

Section: Results

Here we show that mural cell-β3-integrin was expressed only in a subset of blood vessels and that mural-β3-integrin-negative blood vessels were evident. The range of percentages of blood vessels that were mural-β3-integrin negative across individual patient samples was wide in human cutaneous melanoma (mean value, 41%), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (mean value, 49%) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)+ breast cancer (mean value, 57%) ( Figure 1 A; Figures S1 A–S1D). A high percentage of mural-β3-integrin-negative blood vessels (i.e., when more than the mean number of tumor blood vessels are mural-β3-integrin negative) correlated significantly with patients stratified into those with increased (1) tumor burden in human cutaneous melanoma (identified by increased Breslow thickness), (2) tumor cell proliferation in human cutaneous melanoma ( Figure 1 B; Figure S1 E), and (3) tumor size in human diffuse large B cell lymphoma and human ER+ breast cancer ( Figure 1 B) but not with a change in blood vessel density ( Figure 1 C). Importantly, a high proportion of mural-β3-integrin-negative blood vessels correlated with patients with (1) elevated metastasis incidence ( Figure 1 D), (2) increased disease progression stage ( Figure 1 E), (3) elevated incidence of relapse ( Figure 1 F), and (4) advanced aggressive cancer phenotype ( Figure 1 G) in primary human cutaneous melanoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, ER+ breast cancer, and mesothelioma, respectively. Together, these clinical data indicate that a high percentage of blood vessels that are mural-β3-integrin negative correlate with enhanced tumor size and progression with no apparent effect on blood vessel density.
In order to elucidate the possible mechanisms by which pericyte-β3-integrin loss could regulate cancer growth and progression, we generated a mouse model of pdgfrβcre- driven β3-integrin deficiency, where β3-integrin deficiency was confirmed in tumor pericytes. Mendelian ratios, male:female ratios, and average mouse weights were all normal for mice born to pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl × pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figures S2 A–S2D). Pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice showed no apparent defects in non-tumor-burdened tissues ( Figure S2 E), with poor cre-activity in pericytes of unchallenged skin but good cre activity in tumor pericytes ( Figure S2 F; Reynolds et al., 2017 54. Reynolds, L.E. ∙ D’Amico, G. ∙ Lechertier, T. ... Dual role of pericyte α6β1-integrin in tumour blood vessels J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :1583-1595 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mural cell purity was established ( Figure S2 G), and cell survival was not affected by loss of β3-integrin ( Figure S2 H). Loss of β3-integrin, but not β1 or β5 subunits, was evident only in pericytes isolated from pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figure S2 I). Pericyte specificity of deletion was supported by expression of β3-integrin in endothelial cells and fibroblasts from pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figures S2 J and S2K). These data indicate good specificity of β3-integrin deletion in tumor-associated pericytes from pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice in the systems tested.
To examine the effect of pericyte-β3-integrin loss on tumor growth, pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice were injected subcutaneously with syngeneic mouse melanoma B16F0 and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed reduced β3-integrin expression in platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-positive and α-SMA-positive tumor blood vessel pericytes only in pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figure 2 A; Figure S2 L). B16F0 tumor growth and tumor cell proliferation (Ki67) were enhanced significantly in pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figure 2 B; Figure S2 M). The increase in tumor growth was confirmed using LLC tumor cells in pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figure 2 C). In a second experimental setting, B16F10 or LLC cells were injected via the tail vein, and lung tumor burden was measured by microCT imaging. No differences in the number of CMTPX-labeled tumor cell homing (2 h after tail vein injection) or seeding (48 h after injections) were observed between the lungs of each genotype ( Figure S2 N). However, at 16 days after inoculation, enhanced tumor burden was observed in the lungs of pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figures 2 D and 2E). This correlated with an increase in the number and size of B16F10 and LLC lung nodules in pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Orthotopic growth of syngeneic mammary E0771 tumor cells was also enhanced in pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figure 2 H). However, although no difference in the number of spontaneous lung metastases was observed, the size of E0771 lung metastases was significantly increased in pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figure S2 O). Corroborating these results at 13 weeks of age, spontaneous pancreatic tumor growth was significantly enhanced in RIPtag-2 +; pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice compared with RIPtag-2+ ; pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figure 2 I). Together, these data suggest that loss of pericyte-β3-integrin is sufficient to enhance tumor growth at primary and secondary sites.
The effect of pericyte-β3-integrin loss on vascular properties was examined next. Blood vessel density, detected by immunostaining for endomucin, was not significantly different in B16F0, B16F10, LLC, or E0771 tumors in pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice or spontaneous pancreatic tumors in RIPtag-2 +; pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl and RIPtag-2 +; pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl mice ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Figures S3 A–S3D). The percentage of blood vessels lacking mural cells was not significantly changed between genotypes ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Figures S3 E and S3G). No differences between the percentage of tumor blood vessels perfused ( Figure 3 C; Figures S3 F) and the percentage of tumor blood vessels with basement membrane collagen IV in pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl or pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice were detected ( Figure 3 D; Figure S3 H). Blood vessel leakage, tumor hypoxia, and blood flow were also not changed between genotypes ( Figures 3 E and 3F; Figures S3 I and S3J). Last, unchallenged skin of pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice showed no difference in blood vessel density, percentage of αSMA-negative vessels (pericyte coverage), or vessel leakage ( Figure S3 K), most likely because previous reports and our own data indicate that pdgfrβ promoter activity is low in mural cells of normal quiescent vessels ( Figure S2 F; Heldin, 2013; Pietras et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2010 31. Heldin, C.H. Targeting the PDGF signaling pathway in tumor treatment Cell Commun. Signal. 2013; 11 :97 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar 47. Pietras, K. ∙ Rubin, K. ∙ Sjöblom, T. ... Inhibition of PDGF receptor signaling in tumor stroma enhances antitumor effect of chemotherapy Cancer Res. 2002; 62 :5476-5484 PubMed Google Scholar 68. Wang, Z. ∙ Ahmad, A. ∙ Li, Y. ... Emerging roles of PDGF-D signaling pathway in tumor development and progression Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1806 :122-130 PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these data suggest that the enhanced tumor growth in pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice is not associated with any gross effect on tumor blood vessel number, maturation, perfusion, or flow functions and led us to investigate whether a possible paracrine effect of β3-null pericytes on tumor cells could affect tumor growth directly.
To test the paracrine effect of β3-null mural cells on tumor growth, we developed experiments where wild-type C57BL/6 mice were co-injected with tumor cells and either wild-type (WT) or β3-null pericytes and the resulting tumors analyzed. Subcutaneous co-injection of B16F0 with β3-null pericytes (1:8) showed enhanced tumor growth compared with co-injection of WT pericytes with B16F0 cells ( Figure 4 A; Figure S4 A). No differences in tumor blood vessel density or pericyte coverage were observed between these groups ( Figure 4 B). In a second model, co-injection of B16F10 cells with β3-null pericytes via the tail vein of WT C57BL/6 mice increased the number of B16F10 lung nodules and relative nodule size above that of WT pericytes at both 1:4 and 1:8 ratios ( Figure 4 C; Figure S4 B). Using CMTPX-tagged pericytes, the survival of WT and β3-null pericytes after injection in C57BL/6 mice was not different in vivo ( Figure 4 D), suggesting that changes in tumor burden were not affected by differential pericyte survival. Furthermore, blood vessel density and pericyte coverage of blood vessels were not altered ( Figure 4 E; Figure S4 C). B16F0 cell invasion was similar when B16F0 cells were incubated with conditioned medium from WT or β3-null pericytes, suggesting that tumor cell invasion is not affected by paracrine signals generated from β3-null pericytes ( Figure 4 F). In another model, although the number of spontaneous E0771 lung metastases was similar between groups, the size of metastases was elevated in mice that were co-injected with β3-null pericytes ( Figure 4 G; Figure S4 D). In vitro , conditioned medium from β3-null pericytes was able to significantly enhance tumor cell numbers, indicating that a paracrine signal from pericytes controlled malignant cell growth ( Figure 4 H). These data, together with the evidence showing that tumor cell homing and seeding in the lungs are not affected by loss of pericyte-β3-integrin, suggested that tumor growth, either at primary or secondary sites, was enhanced by loss of pericyte-β3-integrin, pointing toward a possible paracrine mechanism of pericyte-tumor cell cross-talk that is regulated by pericyte-β3-integrin.
Next, the molecular mechanisms underlying pericyte-β3-integrin-tumor cell crosstalk were explored. Unbiased proteomics analysis of WT and β3-null pericytes identified increased expression of multiple candidates in β3-null pericytes. These included FAK, a major known regulator of integrin signaling ( Guan, 2010 27. Guan, J.L. Integrin signaling through FAK in the regulation of mammary stem cells and breast cancer IUBMB Life. 2010; 62 :268-276 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 A; Figure S5 A). Proteome-Profiler tyrosine kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase arrays identified that β3-null pericytes also had significantly elevated levels of p-HGFR, p-Akt (S473), and p-Akt (T308) compared with WT pericytes ( Figure 5 B). The enhancement of Akt signaling was further supported by increased expression of phospho-Akt1 (S122) and phospho-Akt1 (S129) in β3-null pericytes ( Figure S5 A). Previous studies have shown that elevated HGFR phosphorylation can activate Akt activity ( Usatyuk et al., 2014 64. Usatyuk, P.V. ∙ Fu, P. ∙ Mohan, V. ... Role of c-Met/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k)/Akt signaling in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-mediated lamellipodia formation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and motility of lung endothelial cells J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :13476-13491 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), which has been recognized previously to regulate angiocrine signaling from endothelial cells ( Guerrouahen et al., 2014 28.

Cancer Ther. 2014; 13 :3123-3136 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). At a molecular level, Akt activity is also known to regulate NF-κB-mediated signaling ( Cheng et al., 2011; Dan et al., 2008 12. Cheng, J. ∙ Phong, B. ∙ Wilson, D.C. ... Akt fine-tunes NF-κB-dependent gene expression during T cell activation J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :36076-36085 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar 16.

Akt-dependent regulation of NF-kappaB is controlled by mTOR and Raptor in association with IKK Genes Dev. 2008; 22 :1490-1500 Crossref Scopus (512) PubMed Google Scholar ). Western blot analysis confirmed that, in addition to increased phospho-hepatocyte growth factor receptor (p-HGFR) expression, phosphorylation of both Akt (at S473) and the NF-kB subunit p65 (at S536) was elevated in β3-null pericytes ( Figure 5 C). The upregulation of activated p65 was confirmed by increased nuclear localization of p-p65 in β3-null pericytes ( Figure S5 B). Pharmacological inhibition of β3-integrin using cilengitide ( Mas-Moruno et al., 2010 37. Mas-Moruno, C. ∙ Rechenmacher, F. ∙ Kessler, H. Cilengitide: the first anti-angiogenic small molecule drug candidate design, synthesis and clinical evaluation Anticancer. Agents Med. Chem. 2010; 10 :753-768 Crossref Scopus (512) PubMed Google Scholar ) in WT pericytes also enhanced the levels of phospho-HGFR, -Akt, and -p65 ( Figure S5 C). Activation of p65 has been associated with upregulation of cytokine production ( Poulos et al., 2016; Tavora et al., 2014 49. Poulos, M.G. ∙ Ramalingam, P. ∙ Gutkin, M.C. ... Endothelial-specific inhibition of NF-κB enhances functional haematopoiesis Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13829 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Tavora, B. ∙ Reynolds, L.E. ∙ Batista, S. ... Endothelial-cell FAK targeting sensitizes tumours to DNA-damaging therapy Nature. 2014; 514 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, β3-null pericytes produced significantly elevated levels of cytokine-related factors, including sICAM-1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), CXCL1, CCL2, and TIMP-1 compared with WT pericytes ( Figure 5 D). The clinical relevance of the enhanced levels of p-Akt and nuclear p65 were supported by the significant upregulation of p-Akt ( Figure 5 E; Figures S5 D and S5E) and nuclear p65 ( Figure 5 F) in mural cells of human cancers where more than the mean percentage of blood vessels were mural-β3-integrin negative.
In intervention studies, FAK inhibitor (PF573228) treatment reduced the expression of pY397-FAK and also the levels of p-HGFR, p-Akt, and p-p65 in β3-null pericytes ( Figure 5 G). Second, treatment with the HGFR inhibitor PHA-665752 reduced HGFR phosphorylation, p-Akt, and subsequent p-p65 levels in β3-null pericytes ( Figure 5 H). Third, treatment with the Akt inhibitor LY294002 reduced both p-Akt and p-p65 levels ( Figure 5 I). Together, these data demonstrate that the elevated p-HGFR levels observed in β3-null pericytes lead to an increase in Akt phosphorylation and subsequent p65 phosphorylation.
The functional relevance of the molecular changes in p-HGFR, p-Akt, and p-p65 in β3-null pericytes were then evaluated. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of Akt in β3-null pericytes (β3-null;Akt KO pericytes [PCs]) resulted in a reduction in phosphorylation and expression of total Akt as well as a reduction in p-HGFR but not total HGFR ( Figure 6 A). CRISPR-Cas9 ablation of HGFR in β3-null PCs (β3-null;HGFR KO PCs) showed a reduction in the expression total HGFR and modest reduction in p-HGFR as well as a reduction in p-Akt but not total Akt ( Figure 6 A). Together, these data indicate cross-regulation of p-Akt and p-HGFR in β3-null PCs. Downstream of this, Akt or HGFR deletion resulted in a reduction in downstream p-p65 (but not total p65), TIMP-1, and CCL2. Furthermore, exposure of B16F0 cells to conditioned medium from β3-null;Akt KO or β3-null;HGFR KO PCs resulted in significantly reduced tumor cell survival compared with B16F0 cells exposed to conditioned medium from Cas9 control-transfected β3-null PCs (β3 null;Cas9) ( Figure 6 B). Although gene-edited PCs showed similar cell survival levels as controls ( Figure S6 A), co-injection of β3-null;Akt KO pericytes with B16F0 cells reduced the enhanced tumor growth observed in mice co-injected with B16F0 and β3-null;Cas9 PC controls ( Figure 6 C). Together, these data indicate a functional role of PC Akt and HGFR in enhanced tumor cell survival induced by loss of PC-β3-integrin.
The functional consequence of inactivation of NF-κB signaling in β3-null PCs was next assessed in rescue of PC cytokine production and tumor cell growth control. β3-null PCs were transfected with the super-repressor, non-phosphorylatable mutant form of Iκ-Bα, Iκ-BαSR, which has been reported to repress the NF-κB pathway ( Pikarsky et al., 2004 48. Pikarsky, E. ∙ Porat, R.M. ∙ Stein, I. ... NF-kappaB functions as a tumour promoter in inflammation-associated cancer Nature. 2004; 431 :461-466 Crossref Scopus (2241) PubMed Google Scholar ). β3-null PC transfection with Iκ-BαSR was sufficient to reduce p-p65 levels back to WT PC levels ( Figure 6 D) and significantly reduce the expression levels of CXCL1, CCL2, and TIMP-1 ( Figure 6 E), indicating that NF-κB signaling was involved in the regulation of these secreted factors. Furthermore, exposure of tumor cells to conditioned medium from Iκ-BαSR-transfected β3-null PCs reduced the enhanced survival of B16F0, B16F10, and LLC cells compared with exposure to conditioned medium from mock-transfected β3-null PCs ( Figure 6 F). In vivo , co-injection of B16F10 cells with Iκ-BαSR-transfected β3-null pericytes via the tail vein into C57BL/6 mice significantly decreased the number of lung nodules and relative nodule size compared with mice co-injected with B16F10 cells and mock-transfected β3-null PCs ( Figure 6 G). No change in cell survival was observed between mock-transfected or Iκ-BαSR-transfected β3-null PCs ( Figure S6 B), suggesting that altered cell survival was unlikely to be responsible for the altered tumor growth in Figure 6 G. Together, these data indicate a functional role of NF-κB signaling in β3-null PC control of tumor growth.
To test the functional relevance of the enhanced levels of β3-null PC-derived CXCL1, CCL2, and TIMP-1 on enhanced tumor cell survival and tumor growth, β3-null PC with CRISPR-Cas9 depletion of CXCL1, CCL2, or TIMP-1 (β3-null;CXCL1 KO , β3-null;CCL2 KO and β3-null;TIMP-1 KO , respectively) were generated, and target-protein depletion was confirmed by western blotting ( Figure 6 H). Similar to the effect of deletion of Akt and HGFR in β3-null PCs, exposure of B16F0 cells to conditioned medium from β3-null;CXCL1 KO , β3-null;CCL2 KO and β3-null;TIMP-1 KO PCs reduced B16F0 cell survival significantly compared with enhanced survival induced by exposure to conditioned medium from β3-null;Cas9 PCs ( Figure 6 I). This effect on enhancing tumor cell survival was corroborated in vivo , where tumor growth was reduced when co-injecting B16F0 cells with either β3-null;CXCL1 KO , β3-null;CCL2 KO , or β3-null;TIMP-1 KO PCs compared with co-injection of B16F0 cells with β3-null;Cas9 PCs ( Figure 6 J). Together, these data suggest that depletion of these factors in β3-null PCs is sufficient to reduce the enhanced tumor growth observed and implicates them functionally, downstream of NFκB activity, as PC-derived paracrine signals that regulate tumor growth.
Because the fold expression increase in β3-null PC cytokine expression was highest for CCL2 (4-fold increase compared with WT PCs; Figure 5 D) and that Iκ-BαSR transfection of β3-null cells reduced CCL2 expression the most (4-fold decrease compared with mock-transfected PCs; Figure 6 E), we examined whether tumor cell CCR2, the receptor for CCL2, is involved in the enhanced tumor cell survival phenotype. B16F0 cells were exposed to conditioned media from WT and β3-null PCs and also treated with the CCR2 i inhibitor or vehicle alone. Inhibition of CCR2 was sufficient to reduce the enhanced tumor cell survival observed after exposure to β3-null PC conditioned medium, suggesting that CCR2 is involved in tumor cell survival after exposure to β3-null PC conditioned medium ( Figure S6 C).
Using phosphoproteomics analysis of malignant cells, the molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced tumor cell survival and growth after exposure to β3-null PCs was examined. Kinase substrate enrichment analysis of the phosphoproteomics data identified that the ROCK2 signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway in tumor cells exposed to β3-null PC conditioned medium compared with tumor cells exposed to WT PC conditioned medium ( Figure 7 A). The phosphorylation levels of a number of proteins involved in tumor cell survival and progression support the notion that paracrine signals from β3-null PCs enhanced cell survival based signaling in tumor cells ( Figure S6 D).
Non-muscle Myosin II has contractile properties and is regulated by phosphorylation of its light and heavy chains ( Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009 66. Vicente-Manzanares, M. ∙ Ma, X. ∙ Adelstein, R.S. ... Non-muscle myosin II takes centre stage in cell adhesion and migration Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 :778-790 Crossref Scopus (1461) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, a key phospho-substrate for many of the kinases arising from phosphoproteomics analysis was Myosin Light Chain 2 (MLC2, MYL12b, and MYL9). Myosin II-driven contractility relies on multiple kinases. Among them, previously published work has shown that Rho-kinase (ROCK) inactivates the myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) phosphatase, which leads to increased phosphorylation of MLC2 (p-MLC2) and activity of Myosin II ( Ito et al., 2004 32. Ito, M. ∙ Nakano, T. ∙ Erdodi, F. ... Myosin phosphatase: structure, regulation and function Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 259 :197-209 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar ). MLC2 is also directly phosphorylated by ROCK ( Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009 66. Vicente-Manzanares, M. ∙ Ma, X. ∙ Adelstein, R.S. ... Non-muscle myosin II takes centre stage in cell adhesion and migration Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 :778-790 Crossref Scopus (1461) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, tumors arising from C57BL/6 mice injected with B16F0 melanoma cells plus β3-null PCs showed increased levels of p-MLC2 protein (a direct substrate of ROCK) compared with B16F0s co-injected with WT PCs ( Figure 7 B). These data indicate that tumors with β3-null PCs grow with higher levels of actomyosin contractility, a feature associated with faster tumor growth in vivo ( Georgouli et al., 2019 22. Georgouli, M. ∙ Herraiz, C. ∙ Crosas-Molist, E. ...

Given that previous reports have demonstrated that MEK1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade signaling pathways are downstream of CCL2/CCR2-stimulated signaling ( Fang et al., 2012; Tang and Tsai, 2012 18. Fang, W.B. ∙ Jokar, I. ∙ Zou, A. ... CCL2/CCR2 chemokine signaling coordinates survival and motility of breast cancer cells through Smad3 protein- and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent mechanisms J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :36593-36608 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Tang, C.H. ∙ Tsai, C.C. CCL2 increases MMP-9 expression and cell motility in human chondrosarcoma cells via the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83 :335-344 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined whether loss of β3-null PC-derived CCL2 was responsible for the enhancement of MEK1 and ROCK2 signaling pathways in B16F0. Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of p-MEK1/2, pERK1/2, and p-MLC2 in B16F0 cells exposed to conditioned medium from β3 null;CCL2 KO PCs compared with B16F0 cells exposed to β3-null;Cas9 PC conditioned medium ( Figure 7 C). These data suggest that CCL2 was involved in enhanced MEK1 and ROCK2 activity in tumor cells. Additionally, B16F0 tumors co-injected with β3-null;CCL2 KO PCs showed a decrease in p-MLC2 levels, further linking a role of CCL2 to enhanced ROCK2-Myosin II activation in vivo ( Figure 7 D).
To test the functional role of ROCK2 and MEK1 in enhancing tumor cell survival, tumor cells were treated with a MEK1 inhibitor (U0126) or ROCK inhibitor (GSK269962A) after exposure to β3-null PCs. Reduced Myosin II or ERK1/2 activity was confirmed after treatment ( Figure 7 E). B16F0 cells pre-treated with the U0126 MEK1 inhibitor or the GSK269962A ROCK inhibitor displayed reduced tumor cell survival after exposure to β3-null PC conditioned medium compared with WT PC conditioned medium ( Figure 7 F). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of ROCK2 in B16F0 cells resulted in reduced Myosin II activity ( Figure S6 E). Although B16F0;ROCK2 KO cells did not have compromised growth in vitro ( Figure S6 F), depletion of ROCK2 in B16F0 cells was sufficient to reduce tumor growth in pdgfrβcre+:β3 fl/fl mice back to that observed in B16F0;ROCK2 WT or B16F0;ROCK2 KO tumor growth in pdgfrβcre-:β3 fl/fl mice ( Figure 7 G). These data confirm that the enhanced B16F0 tumor growth observed in the absence of PC β3-integrin is dependent on B16F0 ROCK2 activity. The relationship between MEK1 and ROCK2 activation has been reported previously ( Arozarena et al., 2011; Vial et al., 2003; Orgaz et al., 2020 3. Arozarena, I. ∙ Sanchez-Laorden, B. ∙ Packer, L. ...

ERK-MAPK signaling coordinately regulates activity of Rac1 and RhoA for tumor cell motility Cancer Cell. 2003; 4 :67-79 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these results demonstrate a functional role of tumor cell MEK1 and ROCK2-Myosin II signaling in enhanced tumor cell survival and tumor cell growth after exposure to β3-null pericytes.

Section: Discussion

Our data establish that mural cells, by losing β3-integrin expression and thus enhancing signaling via the FAK-HGFR-Akt-NF-κB pathway and increasing CCL2-mediated paracrine signals, can increase tumor burden via tumor cell enrichment of MEK1 and ROCK2 signaling pathways in the absence of affecting tumor blood vessel numbers or functionality. These results are not expected and call for further consideration of the role of tumor PCs in direct control of tumor growth and progression.
Previous work has established that PCs play critical roles in blood-brain barrier function, vascular development, control of vessel contraction, blood flow, and hemostasis ( Armulik et al., 2011; Raza et al., 2010 2. Armulik, A. ∙ Genové, G. ∙ Betsholtz, C. Pericytes: developmental, physiological, and pathological perspectives, problems, and promises Dev. Cell. 2011; 21 :193-215 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1996) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Raza, A. ∙ Franklin, M.J. ∙ Dudek, A.Z. Pericytes and vessel maturation during tumor angiogenesis and metastasis Am. J. Hematol. 2010; 85 :593-598 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on these accepted functions as essential blood vessel-supporting cells, elimination of PCs is considered a logical anti-angiogenic strategy to control cancer. Indeed, antagonists of platelet-derived growth factor signaling have ben shown to eliminate tumor PCs, resulting in vascular disruption and effective tumor regression ( Heldin, 2013 31. Heldin, C.H. Targeting the PDGF signaling pathway in tumor treatment Cell Commun. Signal. 2013; 11 :97 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, similar strategies also result in enhancing vessel leakage and hypoxia, elevating metastasis ( Cooke et al., 2012; Keskin et al., 2015; Xian et al., 2006 14. Cooke, V.G. ∙ LeBleu, V.S. ∙ Keskin, D. ...

Xian, X. ∙ Håkansson, J. ∙ Ståhlberg, A. ... Pericytes limit tumor cell metastasis J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116 :642-651 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, targeting PCs and inducing vascular disruption is unlikely to be a long-term effective method of cancer control. Indeed, more recent reports have suggested that cancer progression can be associated with either increased or reduced PC association with tumor blood vessels ( Cooke et al., 2012; Furuhashi et al., 2004; O’Keeffe et al., 2008; Sennino et al., 2007; Sinha et al., 2016; Xing et al., 2015; Yonenaga et al., 2005 14.

Absence of smooth muscle actin-positive pericyte coverage of tumor vessels correlates with hematogenous metastasis and prognosis of colorectal cancer patients Oncology. 2005; 69 :159-166 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these apparently conflicting data suggest that vascular disruption, or even enhanced blood vessel leakage via loss of PCs, may not be an effective method to control cancer. Indeed, they suggest that PCs might control tumor growth through other mechanisms that have not been carefully investigated until now.
Loss of PC adhesion properties is likely to affect their association and recruitment to endothelial cells of the blood vessel wall. Integrins are a family of cell adhesion molecules that control cell-extracellular matrix interactions. PCs are known to express a variety of integrins, including β1- and β3-integrin heterodimers, and reduced pericyte β1-integrin activity and α4- or α6-integrin levels have been shown to affect blood vessel maturation processes ( Garmy-Susini et al., 2005; Reynolds et al., 2017; You et al., 2014 21. Garmy-Susini, B. ∙ Jin, H. ∙ Zhu, Y. ... Integrin alpha4beta1-VCAM-1-mediated adhesion between endothelial and mural cells is required for blood vessel maturation J. Clin.

NG2 proteoglycan promotes tumor vascularization via integrin-dependent effects on pericyte function Angiogenesis. 2014; 17 :61-76 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the role of β3-integrin in pericyte function was unknown.
Our data demonstrate that loss of PC-β3-integrin is sufficient to enhance tumor growth in the absence of changes in blood vessel density, number of PC negative vessels, vessel perfusion, or tumor hypoxia. Previous work has demonstrated that global deletion of β3-integrin is sufficient to enhance tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth ( Reynolds et al., 2002 51. Reynolds, L.E. ∙ Wyder, L. ∙ Lively, J.C. ... Enhanced pathological angiogenesis in mice lacking beta3 integrin or beta3 and beta5 integrins Nat. Med. 2002; 8 :27-34 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that deletion of endothelial cell β3-integrin only transiently inhibits tumor angiogenesis in established tumors ( Steri et al., 2014 58. Steri, V. ∙ Ellison, T.S. ∙ Gontarczyk, A.M. ... Acute depletion of endothelial β3-integrin transiently inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice Circ. Res. 2014; 114 :79-91 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). This enhanced angiogenesis has been proposed to be due to elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced responses of β3-null endothelial cells because of the upregulated VEGF-receptor 2 expression on these cells ( Reynolds et al., 2002, 2004 51. Reynolds, L.E. ∙ Wyder, L. ∙ Lively, J.C. ... Enhanced pathological angiogenesis in mice lacking beta3 integrin or beta3 and beta5 integrins Nat. Med. 2002; 8 :27-34 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Reynolds, A.R. ∙ Reynolds, L.E. ∙ Nagel, T.E. ... Elevated Flk1 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) signaling mediates enhanced angiogenesis in beta3-integrin-deficient mice Cancer Res. 2004; 64 :8643-8650 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our current study suggests that the mechanisms that control tumor growth in PC-specific-β3-integrin knockout mice are distinct from those in global or endothelial cell-specific knockouts because the enhanced tumor growth is not associated with elevated angiogenesis. Thus, explaining how PC-β3-integrin controls tumor growth was explored.
Our data point toward a possible role for mural cells in directly affecting tumor growth and that this is controlled by β3-integrin expression. This conclusion is supported by clinical evidence showing that a high percentage of blood vessels that are mural-β3-intgerin negative is significantly associated with increased tumor size in four different human cancers—cutaneous melanoma, mesothelioma, lymphoma, and breast cancer—without affecting blood vessel density.
Previous studies from other laboratories and our own have demonstrated that vascular endothelial cells can control tumor progression and chemosensitivity without affecting tumor angiogenesis per se via paracrine signals (namely, angiocrine signals) that include cytokines and chemokines ( Acharyya et al., 2012; Gilbert and Hemann, 2010; Tavora et al., 2014 1. Acharyya, S. ∙ Oskarsson, T. ∙ Vanharanta, S. ... A CXCL1 paracrine network links cancer chemoresistance and metastasis Cell. 2012; 150 :165-178 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (880) PubMed Google Scholar 25. Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Hemann, M.T. DNA damage-mediated induction of a chemoresistant niche Cell. 2010; 143 :355-366 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Tavora, B. ∙ Reynolds, L.E. ∙ Batista, S. ... Endothelial-cell FAK targeting sensitizes tumours to DNA-damaging therapy Nature. 2014; 514 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings indicate that vascular cells can regulate tumor growth in a way beyond their roles in vessel development and maintenance. Our mouse models show that loss of PC-β3-integrin is sufficient to enhance tumor growth via paracrine signals independent of tumor blood vessel function or numbers. Indeed, loss or inhibition of PC-β3-integrin expression significantly enhanced the FAK-p-HGFR-p-Akt-p-p65-CCL2 pathway. Interestingly, FAK and Akt are known regulators of cytokine production and angiocrine signaling ( LaBarbera et al., 2015; Perkins, 2012; Tavora et al., 2014 34. LaBarbera, K.E. ∙ Hyldahl, R.D. ∙ O’Fallon, K.S. ... Pericyte NF-κB activation enhances endothelial cell proliferation and proangiogenic cytokine secretion in vitro Physiol. Rep. 2015; 3 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Perkins, N.D. The diverse and complex roles of NF-κB subunits in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 :121-132 Crossref Scopus (747) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Tavora, B. ∙ Reynolds, L.E. ∙ Batista, S. ... Endothelial-cell FAK targeting sensitizes tumours to DNA-damaging therapy Nature. 2014; 514 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, the clinical relevance of these findings was supported by elevated mural cell Akt and p65 phosphorylation in human melanoma, lymphoma, and breast cancer patients who had a high proportion of mural-β3-integrin-negative blood vessels. Furthermore, expression of CXCL1, CCL2, and TIMP-1 was confirmed to be regulated by NF-κB activation, suggesting that these paracrine factors, controlled by NF-κB, could at least be part of the explanation of how β3-null PCs regulate tumor growth. Within tumor cells, inactivation of ROCK2 in B16F0 tumor cells rescued the paracrine effects of β3-null PCs on tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo , suggesting that inhibition of ROCK2 in cancers with low PC-β3-integrin expression could be a way to control cancer growth and possibly progression. That this increase in tumor cell survival was evident even in the absence of other cell types suggests that the mural cell-derived factors can control tumor cell survival independent of blood flow or other cell types.
Overall, our study indicates that mural cells are not simply vessel-supporting cells but that, via β3-integrin, they can regulate tumor growth via mural cell-derived paracrine signals. Our data provide proof of principle for a role of mural cell-β3-integrin and shed light on a mechanism of tumor growth control.

pdgfrβcre mice were obtained from Professor Ralf Adams (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Münster, Germany). β3 fl/fl mice were generated by Professor Katherine Weilbaecher ( Morgan et al., 2010 41. Morgan, E.A. ∙ Schneider, J.G. ∙ Baroni, T.E. ... Dissection of platelet and myeloid cell defects by conditional targeting of the beta3-integrin subunit FASEB J. 2010; 24 :1117-1127 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice were maintained on a pure C57 background for experiments. β3 fl/fl mice were bred with RIPtag-2 mice provided by Professor Douglas Hanahan, generating both male and female mice were used. mTmG mice were obtained from Cancer Research UK. mTmG mice were crossed with pdgfrβcre+ mice to generate pdgfrβcre-;mTmG and pdgfrβcre+;mTmG mice for Cre-specificity analysis. Unchallenged adult skin from TdTom;pdgfrβcre+ and TdTom;pdgfrβcre- control mice , fixed in 4% formalin, sucrose infiltrated, and snap frozen in OCT were used to assess pdgfrβ-driven cre activity in skin mural cells.
Experimental procedures with pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice were taken with 12-14 weeks-old mice. LLC, B16F0 and B16F0 experiments were performed in males and females. E0771 injection were performed in females. RIPtag-2;pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl ; and RIPtag-2;pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl (males and females) were culled at 13 weeks of age. Co-injection experiments were performed in C57BL/6 females (Charles River) 8-12 weeks old.
In vivo experiments have been done in replicate to confirm observations. For all the animal experiments, mice have been randomized in order that every experimental condition is represented with different gender, age or weight as above. For animals bred in-house –health screens (quarterly) were conducted in accordance with FELASA guidelines for health monitoring of rodent colonies, to confirm their free status of known pathogens in accordance with the FELASA screens. No clinical signs were detected. Animals were housed in groups of 4–6 per individually ventilated cage in a 12 h light dark cycle (06:30–18:30 light; 18:30–06:30 dark), with controlled room temperature (21 ± 1°C) and relative humidity (40%–60%). The cages contained 1–1.5 cm layer of animal bedding, and with environmental enrichment including cardboard Bio-tunnel and crinkled paper nesting material. Animals had access to food and water ad libitum .
All animal procedures were approved by our local animal ethics committee, Queen Mary University of London and were executed in accordance with United Kingdom Home Office regulations.
Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), B16F0 (melanoma, derived from C57BL/6), B16F10 (melanoma, derived from C57BL/6), E0771 (breast cancer, derived from C57BL/6) (all from ATCC). LLC, B16F0 and B16F10 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO 10500 (batch 07Q8041K) Pencillin and Streptomcyin. E0771 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO 10500 (batch 07Q8041K) Pencillin and Streptomcyin. Cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C.
Pericytes (WT, β3 null, WT; Cas9, β3 null;Cas9, β3 null;CCL2 KO , β3 null;CXCL1 KO , β3 null;TIMP1 KO ) were cultured in pericyte medium including supplied pericyte growth supplement, FBS and penicillim/streptomycin (ScienCell-#0010).
Primary mouse endothelial cells (MLEC) were isolated from mouse brains and maintained in MLEC medium (Ham’s F-12, DMEM (low glucose) 10% FCS, heparin and endothelial mitogen (Generon),
Primary fibroblasts were also isolated from brains and cultured in DMEM + 10% FCS.
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples from human melanoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, breast cancer and mesothelioma were sectioned, dewaxed, and antigen retrieval carried out in boiling 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0, 4 μm sections were washed three times in PBS, blocked in 1% normal goat serum (NSG) 0.1% Triton X-100 (TX-100) for 1 h. Sections were double or triple immunostained for mouse monoclonal anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin Cy3-conjugated (Sigma-Aldrich-#C6198) and for either rabbit monoclonal anti-CD31 (Abcam-#ab76533), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Akt (ser 473) (Cell Signaling Technology-#3787), rabbit monoclonal anti-NF-κB p65 (Cell Signaling Technology-#8242), rabbit monoclonal anti-β3-integrin (Abcam-#ab75872) or rabbit polyclonal anti-CD61 (ThermoFisher Scientific-#PA5-32890). Sections were then washed three times with PBS, incubated with Alexa® 488-/546-conjugated anti-rabbit diluted 1:200 in 1% NGS 0.1% TX-100, washed three times and mounted with Prolong Gold Anti-Fade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific-#P36931). For triple immunostaining, the tissue sections were further processed by using Tyramide SuperBoost Kit (Invitrogen-#B4093) combined with IHC (TSA-IHC). Different primary antibodies were sequentially applied, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubation and tyramide signal amplification. The slides were microwave heat-treated after each TSA operation.
For data analysis, the percentage of β3-integrin or p-Akt or p65 and α-SMA-double-positive blood vessels was calculated as the number of β3-integrin or p-Akt or p65 and α-SMA-double-positive blood vessels over the total number of α-SMA-positive blood vessels. Patient data are expressed as those with either less, or more, than the mean percentage of blood vessels that are mural β3-integrin negative.
The primers for the Cre PCR: forward primer: 5′-GCTGTAGACGTAGTAAGTATCG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-GCTGGAGTTTCAATACCGGAG-3′. The reaction generates a fragment of approximately 669 bp. The primers for the β3-floxed PCR: forward primer: 5′-TTGTTGGAGGTGAGCGAGTC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GCCCAGCGGATCTCCATCT-3′. The PCR reaction generates a 272 bp fragment for the β3-floxed allele and a 182 bp fragment for the wild-type allele. All the primers were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific. For PCR reactions, the 25 μL reactions contain 21 μL MegaMix-Blue (MicroZone, Client life science), 100 ng DNA, 1 μL of 10 nM forward and reverse primers respectively. For Cre PCR, the PCR program was run as a simplified hot start PCR with initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 1.5 min at 60°C and 1 min at 72°C, followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72°C. For β3-floxed PCR, the PCR program was run with initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 56°C and 30 s at 70°C, followed by a final extension for 8 min at 72°C. The thermocycler used were GeneAmp PCR systems 9700 (Applied Biosystems). 20 μL of the PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide (0.25 μg/ml) and viewed by a gel image system (BioRad, Germany).
All in vivo experiments have been performed according to Arrive Guidelines. 12-14 week old pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice were given a subcutaneous injection of either 1 × 10 5 Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) or B16F0 (melanoma, derived from C57BL/6) into the flank for subcutaneous tumor growth. Tumor growth was measured by using callipers every two days. Tumor volume (V) was calculated: V = (Length x width 2 ) x 0.52. After 20-26 days, animals were culled, tumors excised and either fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS overnight, or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis. For experimental metastasis assays, 5 × 10 5 LLC or B16F10 melanoma cells were injected via the tail vein of pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice. Lung tumor burden was measured by a Nano SPECT/CT® In vivo preclinical imager (Bioscan) 3-4 times over 16 days according to the manufacturer’s instruction ( Wong et al., 2015 72. Wong, P.P. ∙ Demircioglu, F. ∙ Ghazaly, E. ... Dual-action combination therapy enhances angiogenesis while reducing tumor growth and spread Cancer Cell. 2015; 27 :123-137 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). For breast cancer orthotopic model, 1 × 10 5 E0771 cells were orthotopically injected into mammary fat pad of pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice. RIPtag-2;pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl ; and RIPtag-2;pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl ; were culled at 13 weeks of age. At necropsy, pancreas with peri-pancreatic lymph nodes, were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS or snap frozen for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis.
For co-injection tumor growth assays, wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) were intravenously co-injected with 1 × 10 5 B16F10 cells and either 4 × 10 5 WT or β3 null pericytes, or with 1 × 10 5 B16F10 cells and either 8 × 10 5 WT or β3 null pericytes. Three weeks post injection, the mice were sacrificed and the number of metastases in their lungs was counted. For breast cancer orthotopic model, 1 × 10 5 E0771 cells were co-injected with either 4 × 10 5 WT or β3 null pericytes into the mammary fat pad of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. To perform metastasis analysis, the tumor bearing mice were harvested when their primary tumor sizes reached 600 mm 3 , and their lungs were fixed for further metastasis analysis.
For in vivo rescue experiment, β3 null pericytes were transfected using the Nucleofector® electroporation system (Lonza) with either the empty vector (mock control) or Iκ-BαSR (kindly provided by Professor Neil Perkins) for 48 h. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were intravenously coinjected with 1 × 10 5 B16F10 cells and either 4 × 10 5 mock transfected- or Iκ-BαSR transfected-β3 null pericytes. Three weeks post injection, mice were sacrificed and the number of metastases in their lungs was quantified by counting the average of the number of metastases across entire lung H&E stained section area from three different levels of the lungs, with 10 μm separation between each level. H&E stained sections from E0771 metastases and RIPTag-2 metastases were used to assess metastatic burden.
B16F10 melanoma, WT or β3 null pericytes, previously labeled with CellTracker™ Red CMTPX Dye (Molecular probes, Invitrogen, Life Science), were resuspended at 0.5 × 10 6 cells per 100 ul of PBS and injected via the tail vein into mice. At 2 or 48 h post inoculation, mice were sacrificed and lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dissected and images were captured using a Leica MZ16F stereomicroscope. Then lungs were snap-frozen ( Batista et al., 2014 4. Batista, S. ∙ Maniati, E. ∙ Reynolds, L.E. ... Haematopoietic focal adhesion kinase deficiency alters haematopoietic homeostasis to drive tumour metastasis Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5054 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lungs were dissected, photographed using a Leica M16F fluorescence stereomicropscope, snap-frozen in OCT (Killik, Bio-Optica, IT) and 4 μm cryosections were prepared for analysis. Total number of CMTPX positive tumor cells or pericytes were quantified by counting the average of the number of CMTPX positive cells across entire lung section area from three different levels of the lungs (with 10 μm separation between each level), using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Zeiss).
Mouse tissues were fixed in formalin for 24 hr and transferred to 70% ethanol. The tissues were then paraffin embedded, sectioned, dewaxed, and unmasked in boiling 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0. 5 μm sections were washed three times in PBS, blocked in 1% normal goat serum (NSG) 0.1% Triton X-100 (TX-100) for 1 hr. Sections were double immunostained for mouse monoclonal anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin Cy3-conjugated (Sigma-Aldrich-C6198) and for either rat monoclonal anti-endomucin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology-#sc-65495) or rabbit monoclonal anti-β3-integrin (Abcam-#ab75872). Sections were washed three times with PBS, incubated with Alexa® 488-/546-conjugated anti-rabbit or Alexa® 488-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:200 in 1% NGS 0.1% TX-100, washed three times and mounted with Prolong Gold anti-Fade Mountant with DAPI. The percentage of α-SMA-positive blood vessels with β3-integrin expression was calculated as described previously. For collagen IV (rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen IV (Abcam-#ab6586))/endomucin (rat monoclonal anti-endomucin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology-#sc-65495)) and β3-integrin (rabbit polyclonal anti-CD61 (ThermoFisher Scientific-#PA5-32890))/PDGFRβ (rabbit monoclonal anti-PDGFRβ (Cell Signaling Technology-#3169) double immunostaining experiments, mouse tumors were snap-frozen, sectioned and fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min. 4 μm sections were blocked for 45 min with 1.0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with Alexa 546-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at RT (Invitrogen) diluted 1:200 in 1.0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, washed three times and mounted with Prolong Gold anti-Fade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific). TdTom;pdgfrβcre- and TdTom;pdgfrβcre+ mouse unchallenged skin tissues were obtained from Neil Henderson lab (University of Edinburgh).
In vitro , cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at RT. Rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser 536) (Cell Signaling Technology-#3033) antibody was incubated overnight at 4°C and washed three times with PBS followed by incubation with Alexa® 546-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at RT diluted 1:200 in 1.0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, washed three times and mounted with Prolong Gold anti-Fade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific).
The number of endomucin-positive blood vessels present across the entire area of each mid-line tumor section from size and age-matched tumors or unchallenged skins was counted and divided by the area of the section to determine tumor blood vessel density.
For pericyte coverage, the percentage of α-SMA-positive, endomucin-positive blood vessels were counted.
Vascular perfusion was visualized by injecting mice via the tail vein with PE-conjugated 20 μg of rat monoclonal anti-PE-PECAM (BioLegend-#102408) 10 min prior to culling. Tumors were snap frozen, sectioned and stained for endomucin. The ratio (%) of double-positive blood vessels over endomucin-positive vessels provided an indication of blood vessel perfusion.
Hypoxia and extravascular diffusion (vessel leakage) were tested by injecting mice with pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe-1 Kit) intraperitoneally 1 h prior to culling, and followed by intravenous injection of Hoechst dye (0.4 mg, Sigma-Aldrich) 1 min prior to culling and anti-PE-PECAM as above. Tumors were snap frozen, sectioned and fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min. 100 μm thick frozen tumor sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with a FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-pimonidazole (Hydroxyprobe HPI Burlington-#MA01803), and then washed and mounted. Sections were analyzed using confocal microscopy (LSM710, Carl Zeiss). Confocal stacks of 100 μm were taken at 0.5 μm intervals (20x) on multiple fields using 488 nm laser to excite anti-pimonidazole, 543 nm laser to excite anti-PE-PECAM, and 740 nm Mai-Tai fentosecond pulsing laser to excite Hoechst. For Hoechst diffusion quantification, the mean areas for PE-PECAM and Hoechst staining for each 100 μm stack was calculated using ImageJ software. The Hoechst dye diffusion leakage area was calculated relative to PE-PECAM stained vessel area. For hypoxia quantification, the hypoxia index was calculated as the area of pimonidazole staining intensity across the area of tumor section.
The percentage of endomucin-positive vessels with collagen IV expression was calculated as the number of collagen IV and endomucin-double positive blood vessels over the total number of endomucin-positive blood vessels.
Tumors were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded using standard protocols. 4 μm thick sections were incubated at 60 C° for 20 min and then subjected to antigen retrieval using citric acid based antigen unmasking solution (1:100; Vector Laboratories-#H-3300) at 110 C° for 6 min in a Decloaking Chamber™ NxGen (Biocare Medical). Samples were blocked with Dual Endogenous Enzyme-Blocking Reagent (Dako-#S2003) for 10 min and then were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MLC2 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology-#3671) for 40 min at RT, washed and then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories-#BA-1000) for 30 min at RT. Signal was then amplified using VECTASTAIN ABC HRP Elite kit (Vector Laboratories-#PK-6100;) for 20 min at RT and the reaction was developed using Vector® VIP Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories-#SK-4600) for 10 min at RT. Staining was counterstained with Hematoxylin.
Sections from tumor xenograft experiments were imaged using NanoZoomer S210 slide scanner (Hamamatsu, Japan). Staining quantification was performed using QuPath v0.1.2. The entire whole-section images (WSI) were analyzed performing positive cell detection, and three different thresholds were applied according to the intensity scores (0, 1, 2 and 3). Next, the software was trained by creating random trees classification algorithm combined with the intensity information, in order to differentiate tumor from stroma, necrosis and immune cells. Values used in the analysis correspond to the quantification of p-MLC2 in the tumor margins.
High-resolution ultrasound imaging of B16F0 tumors using the Vevo® 2100 system with a MS250 transducer was performed according to manufacturer instruction (Visualsonics). For blood flow, volume and perfusion measurement, contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging was performed according to manufacturer instructions (Vevo® 2100 system). Briefly, B16F0 tumor bearing pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mice were administered with 100 μL of bolus Vevo Micromarker suspension (VisualSonics) via tail vein using tail vein Micromarker™ catheter. The ultrasound images were processed and analyzed by using VevoCQ™ contrast quantification software.
Primary mouse endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pericytes were isolated from mouse brains and maintained as previously described ( Reynolds et al., 2017 54. Reynolds, L.E. ∙ D’Amico, G. ∙ Lechertier, T. ... Dual role of pericyte α6β1-integrin in tumour blood vessels J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :1583-1595 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/fl mouse brains were minced, collagenase type I digested (GIBCO-#17100017), strained through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon) and the resulting cell suspension plated on flasks coated with a mixture of 0.1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich-#G9136), 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Merck-Millipore-#FC010) and 30 μg/ml rat tail collagen (Sigma-Aldrich). Endothelial cells were purified by a single negative (Rat monoclonal anti-mouse FCγ sort-RII/III; BD Biosciences-#553141) and two positive cell sorts (Rat monoclonal anti-mouse ICAM-2; BD Biosciences-#553326), using DYNAL® sheep anti-rat IgG-conjugated magnetic beads (ThermoFisher Scientific-#11035). During preparation of primary endothelial cells, fibroblasts were isolated from the non-endothelial cell population that was generated during the first positive sorting. For all cell types, passaging occurred when cells reached 70% confluency. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, washed with PBS and re-plated on pre-coated flasks for endothelial cells and pericytes and non-coated flasks for fibroblasts. For culture conditions, fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM + 10% FCS to passage 4, endothelial cells in MLEC medium (Ham’s F-12, DMEM (low glucose), 10% FCS, heparin and endothelial mitogen (Generon)) to passage 4-5. Pericytes were cultured in pericyte medium including supplied pericyte growth supplement, FBS and pen/strep (ScienCell-#0010) to passage 10.
SgRNAs were designed using the CRISPOR algorithm ( http://crispor.tefor.net ). sgRNA sequences targeting TIMP-1 (Gene ID: 21857), CXCL1 (Gene ID: 14825), CCL2 (Gene ID: 20296), Akt1 (Gene ID: 11651), and HGFR (Met) (Gene ID: 17295) (see Table S1 ) were cloned into the pLenti-CRISPR–EGFP plasmid (Addgene-#75159) using BsmBI enzyme site. 5.0 × 10 5 cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min and re-suspended in 100 μL of R1 buffer (Invitrogen). CRISPR/Cas9-EGFP plasmid DNA (10 μg) were added into the WT and β3 null pericytes and loaded into a 100 μL Neon electroporation tip (Invitrogen). Electroporation was performed using 1350 mV for 20 ms with 2 pulse program on the Neon Electroporator (ThermoFisher Scientific). After electroporation, cells were rescued in pre-warmed supplemented media in the 0.1% gelatin with collagen and fibronectin-coated plates. 48 h post transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested with 500 μL of FACS buffer (1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS). A 488-nm diode laser was used for the detection of EGFP. In each sample, viable singlet cells were gated via forward-scatter (FSC) laser and side-scatter (SSC) and EGFP positive cells, regardless of expression levels, were sorted using a FACSAria™ III flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) at the Chelsea Flow Cytometry and Light Microscopy Facility.
ROCK2 knockdown in B16F0 melanoma cells was achieved using doxycycline inducible Tet-pLKO-neo lentiviral shRNA constructs (Addgene-#21916). shRNA sequences for ROCK2 (5′-GCATCTCTTGAAGAAACAAAT-3′) and non-targeting shControl (5′-GCGCGATAGCGCTAATAATTT-3′) were designed using The RNAi Consortium collection (MISSION® shRNA, Sigma-Aldrich) and plasmids were generated by GenScript USA Inc. For lentivirus generation, 2 × 10 6 HEK293T cells on p100 dishes were transfected with lentiviral vector (5 μg) along with packaging vectors (pMDLg/pRRE (2.5 μg), pRSV-Rev (2.5 μg) and pMD2.G (2 μg) (Addgene)) using Optimem-I and Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Supernatants with lentiviruses were collected 48 h after transfection, spun down and filtered (0.45 μm). For lentiviral transduction, 2.5 × 10 5 melanoma cells were seeded in T25 flasks and infected with lentiviruses. Stable cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (Sigma-Aldrich). Gene knock-down was induced by the presence of doxycycline in the culture media (2 μg/ml) for in vitro experiments.
For characterization of primary mouse brain pericytes, pericytes were washed with PBS and trypsinized at 37°C. The cell suspensions were washed in medium containing serum and centrifuged at 1, 200 rpm for 3 min. Cells were washed with cold FACS buffer (1% BSA/PBS) and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with FACS buffer and the cell suspensions were incubated with the following primary antibodies: Rabbit polyclonal anti-NG2, Alexa Flour®488 conjugated (Merck Millipore-#AB5320A4), Rat monoclonal PE-anti-CD31 (BioLegend-#102508), rat monoclonal PE-anti-CD11b (Mac1) (BioLegend-#101208), rat monoclonal APC-anti-PDGFRβ (BioLegend-#136008), rat monoclonal APC-anti-PDGFRα (BioLegend-#135908), rat monoclonal PE/Cy7-anti-CD146 (BioLegend-#134714) for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times in sample buffer and re-suspended in a final volume of 400 ml. As a control, unstained cells were FACS sorted.
WT and β3 null pericytes were grown in normal pericyte media and the whole-cell lysates were extracted after 72 h incubation. Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase and tyrosine kinase arrays ( Proteome-Profilers ARY001B & ARY003B, R&D systems) were processed according to the manufacturer’s instruction using 300 μg of lysates per membrane. Pixel analysis was used for quantification with ImageJ software.
Pericytes, endothelial cells or fibroblasts were harvested and lysed with NP40 lysis buffer (Invitrogen). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 15-30 μg of protein from each sample was loaded onto 8%–12% polyacrylamide gels. The protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated for 1 h in 5% milk phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T), followed by an overnight incubation of primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in 2% milk PBS-T at 4°C. The blots were then washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with the relevant horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody diluted 1:1000 in 2% milk in PBS-T, for 1h at RT. Chemiluminescence was detected by exposing the membrane to high performance Super XR film (Fujifilm, PYSER-SGI limited). Densitometry readings were calculated with ImageJ software. Hsc70 was used as loading control. The following antibodies were used: rat monoclonal anti-endomucin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology-sc-65495), rabbit monoclonal anti-β3-integrin (Cell Signaling Technology-#4702), rabbit monoclonal anti-β5-integrin (Cell Signaling-#3629), rabbit monoclonal anti-β1-integrin (Cell Signaling Technology-#4706), rabbit monoclonal anti-PDGFRβ (Cell Signaling Technology-#3169), rabbit polyclonal anti-NG2 (Merck Millpore-AB5320), rabbit monoclonal anti-NF-κB p65 (Cell Signaling Technology-#8242), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-NF- κB p65 (Ser 536) (Cell Signaling Technology-#3033), rabbit monoclonal anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology-#4691), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser 473) (Cell Signaling Technology-#4060), mouse monoclonal anti-Hsc70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology-#sc7298), goat polyclonal anti-MCP-1 (CCL2) (ThermoFisher Scientific-#PA5-46954), rat monoclonal anti-CXCL1 (ThermoFisher Scientific-#MA5-23811), mouse monoclonal anti-TIMP-1 (ThermoFisher Scientific-#MA5-13688), rabbit monoclonal anti-Myosin Light Chain 2 (Cell Signaling Technology-#3672), rabbit anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr397) (Cell Signaling Technology-#3283), mouse monoclonal anti-Met (HGFR) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology-#sc-8057), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Met (HGFR) (Tyr1234/1235) (Cell Signaling Technology-#3077), mouse monoclonal anti-Akt1 (Cell Signaling Technology-#2967), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221) (Cell Signaling Technology-#9121), mouse monoclonal anti-Rock II (Biosciences-#610624).
WT and β3 null pericytes were seeded in 100 cm 2 Petri dishes at (1 × 10 6 cells/ml). concentration. B16f0 cells were treated with CM from WT and β3 null pericytes for 30 min and 24 h in 100 cm 2 Petri dishes (1 × 10 6 cells/ml). Cells were washed twice with cold PBS supplemented with 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 and 1 mM NaF and lysed in 500 ul urea buffer (8 M urea in 20 mM in HEPES pH 8.0 supplemented with 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 and 1 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate). Cell lysates were homogenized by sonication for 15 cycles of 30 s on 35 s off (Diagenode Bioruptor® Plus, Liege, Belgium). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and protein in the cell extracts was quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) analysis (ThermoFisher Scientific-#23225).
For phosphoproteome analyses, we used published methods ( Gruhler et al., 2005; Larsen et al., 2005; Montoya et al., 2011 26. Gruhler, A. ∙ Olsen, J.V. ∙ Mohammed, S. ... Quantitative phosphoproteomics applied to the yeast pheromone signaling pathway Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4 :310-327 Crossref Scopus (709) PubMed Google Scholar 35.

Characterization of a TiO 2 enrichment method for label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics Methods. 2011; 54 :370-378 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). As they were eluted from the nano-LC system, peptides were infused into the online connected Q-Exactive Plus system operating with a 2.1 s duty cycle. Acquisition of full scan survey spectra (m/z 375-1,500) with a 70,000 FWHM resolution was followed by, data-dependent acquisition in which the 15 most intense ions were selected for HCD (higher energy collisional dissociation) and MS/MS scanning (200-2,000 m/z) with a resolution of 17,500 FWHM. A 30 s dynamic exclusion period was enabled with an exclusion list with 10 ppm mass window. Overall duty cycle generated chromatographic peaks of approximately 30 s at the base, which allowed the construction of extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) with at least 10 data points. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE ( Vizcaíno et al., 2016 67. Vizcaíno, J.A. ∙ Csordas, A. ∙ del-Toro, N. ... 2016 update of the PRIDE database and its related tools Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D447-D456 Crossref Scopus (2916) PubMed Google Scholar ). Partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD014513 (project DOI 10.6019/ PXD014513)
Mascot Daemon 2.5.0 was used to automate peptide identification from MS data. Peak list files (MGFs) from RAW data were generated with Mascot Distiller v2.6.1.0 and loaded into the Mascot search engine (v2.5) in order to match MS/MS data to peptides ( Perkins et al., 1999 46. Perkins, D.N. ∙ Pappin, D.J. ∙ Creasy, D.M. ... Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data Electrophoresis. 1999; 20 :3551-3567 Crossref Scopus (7034) PubMed Google Scholar ). The searches were performed against the SwissProt Database (SwissProt_2018_09. fasta) with a FDR of ∼1% and the following parameters: 2 trypsin missed cleavages, mass tolerance of ± 10 ppm for the MS scans and ± 25 mmu for the MS/MS scans, carbamidomethyl of Cys as a fixed modification, PyroGlu on N-terminal Gln and oxidation of Met and phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, and Tyr as variable modifications. The in-house developed Pescal software was used for label-free peptide quantification ( Cutillas, 2017; Wilkes et al., 2017 15. Cutillas, P.R. Targeted In-Depth Quantification of Signaling Using Label-Free Mass Spectrometry Methods Enzymol. 2017; 585 :245-268 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar 71.

Proteomics. 2017; 16 :1694-1704 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), XICs for all the peptides identified across all samples were constructed with ± 7 ppm and ± 2 min mass and retention time windows, respectively. Peak areas from all XICs were calculated. Undetectable peptides were given an intensity value of 0. Values of 2 technical replicates per sample were averaged and intensity values for each peptide were normalized to total sample intensity. Unpaired, two-tail Student’s t test was used to assess significance in phosphoproteomics data.
For αvβ3-integrin inhibitor experiments, β3 null pericytes were treated with either placebo or 20 μM Cilengitide (purchased from Bachem) for 24 h. For HGFR inhibitor experiments, β3 null pericytes were treated with either DMSO or 1 μM HGFR inhibitor (PHA-665752, provided by Dr. Stéphanie Kermorgant) for 10, 30 and 60 min respectively. For Akt inhibitor experiments, β3 null pericytes were treated with either DMSO or 10 μM Akt inhibitor (LY294002, Sigma-Aldrich-#L9908) for 10, 30 and 60 minutes respectively. For FAK inhibitor experiments, β3 null pericytes were treated with either DMSO or 10 μM FAK inhibitor (PF573228, TOCRIS-#3239) for 24 hours respectively.
For MEK or ROCK inhibitor experiments, B16F0 cells were treated with either the conditioned medium from WT or β3 null pericytes in the presence of either DMSO, MEK inhibitor (U0126, TOCRIS-#1144) or ROCK inhibitor (GSK269962A, TOCRIS-#4009) for 3 days in MTS experiments and 3 days for in vivo experiments or 1 day for western blot analysis.
CCR2 i was discovered through structure-activity relationship modification of screening hits and synthesized by the Medicinal Chemistry Department at ChemoCentryx (Mountain View, CA) according to procedures described (Patent Application Numbers: WO 2014089495 and WO 2016187393). B16F0 cells were treated with conditioned medium form β3 null pericytes in combination or not with CCR2 i for 48 h for MTS assays.
WT and β3 null pericytes or transfected WT and β3 null pericytes were grown in normal pericyte media. After 72 h of transfection, the whole-cell lysates were extracted. Mouse cytokine arrays ( Proteome-Profiler ARY006, R&D systems) were processed according to the manufacturer’s instruction using 300 μg of lysates per membrane, incubated overnight and developed using Streptavidin-HRP system ( Tavora et al., 2014 62. Tavora, B. ∙ Reynolds, L.E. ∙ Batista, S. ... Endothelial-cell FAK targeting sensitizes tumours to DNA-damaging therapy Nature. 2014; 514 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pixel analysis was used for quantification with ImageJ software.
WT and β3 null pericytes were cultured with pericyte medium for 72 h. This medium was then collected and applied to B16F0, B16F10, LLC cells for 3 days at 37°C and tumor cell survival was assessed using the MTS assay as described later. For mock/Iκ-BαSR-transfected pericyte medium, the pericytes were transfected using the Nucleofector® electroporation system (Lonza) with either the empty vector or Iκ-BαSR. After 72 h incubation, this medium was collected and applied to B16F0, B16F10, LLC cells for 3 days.
LLC, B16F0 or B16F10 cell survival was assessed using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega-#G3582), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were read at a wavelength of 490 nm, with absorbance measured relative to blank wells containing reagent only.
Invasion assays were performed using transwell polycarbonate membranes (Sigma Aldrich). A suspension of 5 × 10 4 B16F0 cells in 100 μL OptiMEM was seeded in the upper chamber of the transwell, being the 8 μm-pore membrane pre-coated with 50 μL of collagen (3 mg/ml in serum free DMEM). The lower chamber was filled with conditioned medium from WT or β3 null pericytes during 48 h. At the endpoint membranes were fixed with PFA 4% and stained with DAPI. Number of cells per field were quantified using using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Zeiss).
pdgfrβcre-;β3 fl/fl and pdgfrβcre+;β3 fl/f were injected with 1 × 10 5 B16F0;ROCK2 KO cells or and B16F0;ROCK2 WT cells. Induction of the transgene in the cell lines in vivo was performed by administering doxycycline 2 mg/l in drinking water with 5% sucrose. The administration of doxycycline took place once the tumors were palpable (7 days after injection).
Student’s t test, Chi-square test and two way ANOVA were performed for the statistical analysis and the details can be found in the figure legends: test used, exact value of n and dispersion measures. Statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism. Outliers have been identified using ROUT test and excluded from the analysis.
