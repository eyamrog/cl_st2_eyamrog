Title: Prefrontal deep projection neurons enable cognitive flexibility via persistent feedback monitoring


Abstract: Summary

Cognitive flexibility, the ability to alter strategy according to changing stimulus-response-reward relationships, is critical for updating learned behavior. Attentional set-shifting, a test of cognitive flexibility, depends on the activity of prefrontal cortex (PFC). It remains unclear, however, what role PFC neurons play to support set-shifting. Using optogenetics and two-photon calcium imaging, we demonstrate that medial PFC activity does not bias sensorimotor responses during set-shifting, but rather enables set-shifting by encoding trial feedback information, a role it has been known to play in other contexts. Unexpectedly, the functional properties of PFC cells did not vary with their efferent projection targets. Instead, representations of trial feedback formed a topological gradient, with cells more strongly selective for feedback information located further from the pial surface, where afferent input from the anterior cingulate cortex was denser. These findings identify a critical role for deep PFC projection neurons in enabling set-shifting through behavioral feedback monitoring.

Section: Introduction

Cognitive flexibility, the ability to respond to changing environmental contingencies, is helpful for navigating through dynamic environments. A form of cognitive flexibility frequently used in clinical assessments is attentional set-shifting, a kind of task-switching behavior that requires a subject to ignore a previously relevant stimulus feature and instead attend to a previously irrelevant feature ( Heisler et al., 2015 35.

The dominant model for the role of PFC in set-shifting, which has drawn on support from numerous high-impact publications over the past three decades ( Miller and Cohen, 2001 51.

Neurosci. 2016; 19 :1234-1242 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these studies suggest that PFC activity might provide an attentional filter that biases sensorimotor responses during set-shifting ( Wimmer et al., 2015 83. Wimmer, R. ∙ Schmidt, L. ∙ Davidson, T. ... Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention Nature. 2015; 526 :705-709 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar )—a well-predicated but unproven hypothesis.
Importantly, set-shifting tasks are typically uncued, mirroring the need for uncued adaptations to changing environmental contingencies in the real world; so, set-shifting performance requires continuous trial-and-error learning. Thus, an alternative and not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that PFC supports set-shifting by monitoring feedback in response to recent decisions. In addition to encoding context, prefrontal activity has been shown to represent feedback signals associated with trial outcomes ( Bissonette and Roesch, 2015 9. Bissonette, G.B. ∙ Roesch, M.R.

Neurosci. 2015; 9 :266 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Starkweather et al., 2018 75. Starkweather, C. ∙ Gershman, S. ∙ Uchida, N. The Medial Prefrontal Cortex Shapes Dopamine Reward Prediction Errors under State Uncertainty Neuron. 2018; 98 :616-629.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), and recent evidence suggests that such feedback-related activity is important for task-switching behavior ( Biró et al., 2019 7.

Neurosci. 2019; 13 :119 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ellwood et al., 2017 27. Ellwood, I.T. ∙ Patel, T. ∙ Wadia, V. ... Tonic or Phasic Stimulation of Dopaminergic Projections to Prefrontal Cortex Causes Mice to Maintain or Deviate from Previously Learned Behavioral Strategies J. Neurosci. 2017; 37 :8315-8329 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether PFC activity supports set-shifting through feedback monitoring or through attentional modulation of sensorimotor responses is unclear.
It is also unclear how distinct circuit elements interact within PFC to support set-shifting. A major set of questions in behavioral neuroscience in recent years has centered on how best to define anatomical markers of cell types within cortex. Are the functional/coding properties of a given pyramidal neuron determined by its efferent connectivity or by its laminar location, a correlate of its afferent connectivity ( Adesnik and Naka, 2018 1.

Harris, K.D. ∙ Shepherd, G.M. The neocortical circuit: themes and variations Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :170-181 Crossref Scopus (642) PubMed Google Scholar ). These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and the fact that neuronal subpopulations with distinct efferent connectivity profiles are often found in distinct cortical layers makes it hard to disambiguate the relative contributions of these two factors. While findings from numerous recent studies implicate both laminar location and efferent connectivity in determining the functional properties of pyramidal neurons ( Lui et al., 2021 44.

The critical contribution of PFC activity to set-shifting may be mediated by a number of output pathways, but two PFC projection targets of particular interest are the projection to ventromedial striatum (PFC-VMS) and to the mediodorsal thalamus (PFC-MDT). In rodents, both target structures have established roles in set-shifting behavior ( Aoki et al., 2015 4. Aoki, S. ∙ Liu, A.W. ∙ Zucca, A. ...

Action Selection and Flexible Switching Controlled by the Intralaminar Thalamic Neurons Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :2370-2382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), and PFC projections to both structures underlie behavior that relies on cognitive flexibility ( Marton et al., 2018 49. Marton, T.F. ∙ Seifikar, H. ∙ Luongo, F.J. ... Roles of Prefrontal Cortex and Mediodorsal Thalamus in Task Engagement and Behavioral Flexibility J.

Cell-type-specific contributions of medial prefrontal neurons to flexible behaviors J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :4490-4504 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is unknown whether PFC projections to these downstream targets convey similar or distinct task-critical information during set-shifting.
To address these questions, we developed and validated a novel set-shifting task for head-fixed mice to enable two-photon imaging during serial attentional set-shifts spanning hundreds of trials. While PFC neural activity encoded all essential task features, neural signals encoding the animal’s response were detected only after trial completion, supporting a role for PFC cells in feedback monitoring rather than attentional biasing of sensorimotor responses. This feedback signal persisted through four subsequent trials, spanning up to 55 s. Separate analysis of PFC-VMS and PFC-MDT neurons revealed strikingly similar representations of all task-related features in both cell types. Unexpectedly, whereas optogenetic inhibition of either cell type had no effect on performance when delivered during trials , inhibition during the post-trial epoch did impair performance, confirming that the role of these neurons in set-shifting was feedback monitoring and not attentional modulation of sensorimotor responses. Furthermore, while the functional properties of PFC cells did not vary with their efferent projection targets in this context, we found that representations of trial feedback formed a topological gradient, with cells more strongly selective for feedback information located further from the pial surface and receiving denser afferent inputs from the caudo-ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Together, these findings reveal a critical role for deep PFC projection neurons in supporting set-shifting by relaying feedback information to downstream targets.

Section: Results

Water-restricted mice were presented on each trial with one of two possible whisker vibration stimuli (e.g., 35 versus 155 Hz vibration presented bilaterally) and one of two possible odor stimuli (e.g., almond oil versus olive oil), in randomized combinations, cueing them to respond by licking a left or right lick port to retrieve a water reward upon termination of the 2.5 s compound stimulus ( Figures 1 A and 1B). In alternating trial blocks, either whisker or odor stimuli signaled the location of the reward. As in most set-shifting tasks ( Bissonette et al., 2008 10. Bissonette, G.B. ∙ Martins, G.J. ∙ Franz, T.M. ... Double dissociation of the effects of medial and orbital prefrontal cortical lesions on attentional and affective shifts in mice J.

Attentional set-shifting in rodents: a review of behavioural methods and pharmacological results Curr. Pharm. Des. 2014; 20 :5046-5059 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), animals underwent a standardized series of task transitions to expose them to multiple exemplars from each stimulus modality and build an attentional set: simple discrimination (SD), in which animals were trained to discriminate between two stimuli within a single sensory modality; compound discrimination (CD), in which a distractor stimulus from the untrained sensory modality was added; intradimensional shift (IDS), in which the stimuli from the relevant sensory modality were replaced with a new pair of exemplars; reversal (Rev), in which the left/right mapping was switched; extradimensional shift (EDS), in which the rule changed for the first time so that the pair of stimuli from the previously irrelevant sensory modality became the relevant stimuli; a second IDS (IDS2), in which the pair of stimuli from the newly relevant sensory modality was replaced with a new pair of exemplars; and finally, serial extradimensional shift (SEDS), in which the rule switched automatically whenever the animal reached criterion performance, which was 80% correct within a 30-trial moving window and >50% on both left and right trials ( Figure 1 A; see STAR Methods for details). Infusion of muscimol within PFC ( Figure 1 D) impaired set-shifting performance, increasing trials to criterion in the initial EDS shift as well as after completing 10 shifts of SEDS ( Figure 1 E).
Trials belonged to two classes, which were randomized from trial to trial: those in which the whisker and odor rules cued the same response direction (congruent [CG] trials) and those in which the whisker and odor rules cued opposing response directions (incongruent [ICG] trials). Therefore, ICG trials, but not CG trials, required application of the modality rule, and feedback from ICG trials alone carried information about modality rule. Animals used prior ICG trial information to guide behavior, so that ICG trial performance was enhanced following feedback from a recent ICG trial, and this held true in trials occurring both early and late within trial blocks ( Figure 1 F).
To measure task-related activity in PFC neurons, GCaMP6f-mediated two-photon calcium imaging was performed through a coronally implanted microprism ( Andermann et al., 2013 3. Andermann, M.L. ∙ Gilfoy, N.B. ∙ Goldey, G.J. ...

USA. 2014; 111 :18739-18744 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), producing a field of view that preserved cortical laminar structure and comprised prelimbic and infralimbic areas ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S7 A). GCaMP was expressed pan-neuronally (hSyn-GCaMP6f) or in specific projection neuron subtypes (hSyn-DIO-GCaMP6f and rAAV2-Cre in PFC-VMS and PFC-MDT). Although these cell types were subsequently analyzed separately, we began by characterizing the task responsiveness of all labeled neurons.
We used tensor component analysis (TCA; Figure 2 D) to decompose the neural data into low-rank factors defined as related sets of weights in the neuron, trial, and time point (within-trial) dimensions ( Williams et al., 2018 82. Williams, A.H. ∙ Kim, T.H. ∙ Wang, F. ... Unsupervised Discovery of Demixed, Low-Dimensional Neural Dynamics across Multiple Timescales through Tensor Component Analysis Neuron. 2018; 98 :1099-1115.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because this dimensionality reduction technique separates trial and time point components, it allowed for variables to be directly compared with each other, regardless of when their peak representation occurred within the trial. Using the trial components as inputs to a support vector machine (SVM)-based maximum-margin linear decoder ( Christianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000 19. Christianini, N. ∙ Shawe-Taylor, J. An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods Cambridge University Press, 2000 Crossref Google Scholar ; Meyers et al., 2008 50. Meyers, E.M. ∙ Freedman, D.J. ∙ Kreiman, G. ... Dynamic population coding of category information in inferior temporal and prefrontal cortex J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100 :1407-1419 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ), trials were classified according to whisker stimulus (e.g., clicks versus 210 Hz), odor stimulus (e.g., almond versus olive), response (left/right), outcome (correct/incorrect), and rule (attend whisker or odor) with near perfect accuracy in held-out test data ( Figure 2 E; see also Figure S7 and STAR Methods for model parameterization).
General linear model (GLM) coefficients for whisker and odor stimuli were significantly correlated with each other across factors, as were response and outcome , indicating these pairs of variables were encoded by similar activity patterns ( Figure 2 F). One way this could manifest is if activity patterns encoding whisker and odor follow overlapping temporal trajectories within the trial, and likewise for response and outcome . To determine the trial-aligned time courses of the factors associated with the task variables, we plotted the TCA-derived temporal components of the factors most strongly associated with each variable ( Figure 2 G). Temporal components associated with whisker and odor stimulus peaked during stimulus presentation, while components associated with outcome peaked during the subsequent inter-trial interval (ITI). Notably, components associated with response followed a temporal trajectory that was similar to outcome , peaking after the end of the trial. These results demonstrate that all task elements necessary for successfully executing the task are represented in PFC neuronal population activity; that activity patterns associated with response are more correlated with those associated with outcome than with those associated with the decision-related stimuli; and that the response -associated patterns lag, rather than lead, the animal’s behavioral choice.
Because the TCA-based population analysis revealed signals encoding response and outcome in the post-trial ITI, we wondered whether these variables might continue to be represented in the neural signal beyond the start of the subsequent trial. To answer this question, we used GLM regression to model activity rates in individual neurons as a function of whisker stimulus , odor stimulus , response, outcome , and rule , with the addition of the variables previous trial response and previous trial outcome . Analysis of the mean GLM coefficients at each time point ( Figure 3 C) revealed that coefficient values for response and outcome peaked at a mean of 1.73 and 2.42 s after stimulus offset, respectively, and remained elevated above chance through the following trial.
Given that animals required 15–20 incongruent trials to abandon a rule after an uncued rule change ( Figure 1 E), we looked for signs of outcome-related evidence accumulation that spanned multiple trials, as has been reported in reinforcement learning tasks ( Bari et al., 2019 5. Bari, B.A. ∙ Grossman, C.D. ∙ Lubin, E.E. ...

Neurosci. 2011; 14 :366-372 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ; Siniscalchi et al., 2019 72. Siniscalchi, M. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Kwan, A. ). Enhanced Population Coding for Rewarded Choices in the Medial Frontal Cortex of the Mouse Cereb. Cortex. 2019; 29 :4090-4106 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). We ran linear decoders on whisker and odor stimuli , response , and outcome for past trials and found that, while whisker and odor representations were no longer detectable after one trial, response and outcome representations persisted for up to four trials, or up to 55 s ( Figure 3 D).
Do these response and outcome signals reflect the demands of the uncued set-shifting task, or are they natively expressed during decision-making more generally? To answer this question, we tracked these signals across learning stages. Signals corresponding with the relevant stimulus were present from the earliest recorded session (CD) and remained strong throughout all subsequent task stages ( Figure 3 E, top row). Conversely, response - and outcome -related activity emerged only over the course of multiple task transitions ( Figure 3 E, rows 2 and 3).
That trial feedback information could be decoded for up to four trials in the past led us to question how these past trials were encoded: were these representations stable, maintained by consistent groups of neurons, or maintained by groups whose membership shifted over time? We first examined the stability of outcome selectivity across sessions and found that outcome is represented by relatively stable groups of neurons over days ( Figures 4 A–4C).
We then examined the temporal stability of outcome signals over trials. The neurons responsible for coding a given trial outcome might shift between trials, with different groups of neurons inheriting representations of different past trials. Alternatively, these trial histories might be multiplexed by the same neurons, whose activity could be incrementally modulated with each correct and incorrect trial. To test these possibilities, we compared outcome selectivities for successive past trials and found that they were indeed supported by correlated populations, whereby, e.g., neurons excited by reward in trial t-1 were also excited by reward in trial t-2 ( Figures 4 D–4G). Together, these results define a coding scheme in which a subset of PFC neurons represent the outcome of each trial, with their activity state modulated in an incremental, relatively colinear way, with decreasing amplitude as trials recede into the past, rather than different groups of neurons representing outcomes at different latencies from each trial.
Our above-mentioned findings indicate that PFC cells are highly functionally heterogeneous with respect to their contributions to cognitive flexibility in this set-shifting paradigm. To understand the mechanistic basis of this functional heterogeneity, we questioned whether the task-related activity of a PFC neuron might be a function of its long-range efferent connectivity profile or of its laminar location, a correlate of afferent connectivity. While not mutually exclusive, these two proposed correlates of functional specialization within cortex have motivated numerous studies in recent years, and noteworthy findings have lent support to both hypotheses.
To examine the degree to which projection target specificity contributed to the functional heterogeneity of in PFC neurons during set-shifting, we examined the functional properties PFC-VMS and PFC-MDT neurons, two projection-defined PFC output populations whose target structures have both been implicated in supporting cognitive flexibility in prior work ( Block et al., 2007 12.

A Designer AAV Variant Permits Efficient Retrograde Access to Projection Neurons Neuron. 2016; 92 :372-382 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (780) PubMed Google Scholar ), using rAAV-Cre labeling, revealed two largely non-overlapping cell types that were also spatially intermingled ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Despite this sparse cross-labeling, examination of fluorescent axons in labeled neurons from the two groups ( Figures 5 C and 5D) revealed two distinct populations ( Figures 5 E and S5 ), and SVM linear decoders trained to classify injection type, based on the labeling densities in the target regions presented in Figure 5 E, performed with 100% accuracy on held-out test data from each animal.
Contrary to our expectations, the two populations showed a striking degree of overall similarity in their task responsiveness ( Figure 5 F). Both populations showed modulation by trial outcome that emerged through successive learning stages ( Figure 5 G). Similar distributions of neurons in each population were excited versus inhibited by trial onset ( Figure 5 H), and the two cell types each showed comparable distributions of correct-preferring and incorrect-preferring neurons ( Figure 5 I). Principal component analysis showed similar trial-aligned temporal profiles for the main components ( Figure 5 J). Together, these results show that while individual PFC neurons are highly heterogeneous in their functional properties, efferent projection targets do not account for this functional heterogeneity in these two major projection subtypes.
The finding of durable representations of trial feedback signals over successive trials raised the possibility that the task-critical role of the PFC might be feedback monitoring. However, the robust representation of whisker/odor stimuli and rule , particularly during stimulus presentation, tended to support the prevailing model of PFC involvement in set-shifting, namely that PFC activity controls top-down, attention-mediated biasing of rule-dependent action selection in the task. We next tested these possibilities using projection-targeted optogenetics.
We used the soma-targeted, anion-conducting channelrhodopsin stGtACR2 ( Mahn et al., 2018 46. Mahn, M. ∙ Gibor, L. ∙ Patil, P. ... High-efficiency optogenetic silencing with soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsins Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4125 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ) to inhibit PFC activity ( Figure 6 A). Photoactivation of the channel across a 10-fold range of light intensities produced strong silencing of spiking activity in extracellular recordings ( Figure 6 B). Next, we tested the requirement of PFC activity for successful set-shifting performance in three temporally controlled stimulation regimes: during trials (0.5 s trial-ready cue period, 2.5 s stimulus presentation, and ≤1.5 s response window), during the ITI (8–10 s epoch triggered on response lick) following CG trials, or during the ITI following ICG trials ( Figure 6 C). Trial blocks (beginning with rule switch and ending with the animal reaching criterion for the new rule) alternated light off/on.
Photoactivation of pan-neuronally expressed stGtACR2 during the ITI following incongruent trials impaired performance on ICG trials ( Figure 6 D), but not on CG trials ( Figure 6 E). No effect of light was seen for control tdTomato-expressing animals ( Figures 6 D and 6E). This effect was also seen in animals expressing stGtACR2 in PFC-VMS or PFC-MDT projection neurons ( Figures 6 D and 6E). When light was delivered following CG trials, no impairment was seen on ICG trial performance for either projection population ( Figure 6 F), indicating that the impairment seen with post-ICG inhibition reflected an interference with prior trial feedback, rather than preparation for the subsequent trial (see also Table S1 ). Together, these results confirm a critical role for post-trial activity in both PFC-VMS and PFC-MDT neurons in enabling set-shifting.
Strikingly, neither PFC-VMS nor PFC-MDT activity was necessary for execution of the rule-guided response, as no impairment was seen with photoactivation during ICG trials ( Figure 6 G). In light of this unexpected result, we sought another association area that might mediate rule-dependent responding in real-time. We chose the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which has been previously implicated in cognitive flexibility ( Fox et al., 2003 29. Fox, M. ∙ Barense, M. ∙ Baxter, M. Perceptual attentional set-shifting is impaired in rats with neurotoxic lesions of posterior parietal cortex J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :676-681 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Prado et al., 2017 59. Prado, V. ∙ Janickova, H. ∙ Al-Onaizi, M. ... Cholinergic circuits in cognitive flexibility Neuroscience. 2017; 345 :130-141 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as in monitoring sensory history ( Akrami et al., 2018 2. Akrami, A. ∙ Kopec, C. ∙ Diamond, M. ... Posterior parietal cortex represents sensory history and mediates its effects on behaviour Nature. 2018; 554 :368-372 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). Silencing of PPC during trials impaired performance on ICG trials, but not on CG trials ( Figure 6 G), indicating that the PPC mediates responding in the task in a specifically rule-dependent manner, possibly by an attentional mechanism.
The surprising similarity of both task-related activity and the task-critical function of the PFC-VMS and PFC-MDT pathways left open the question of whether the functional heterogeneity of PFC neurons might be explained by their spatial distribution. As has been demonstrated in sensory cortex ( Smith and Kohn, 2008 73. Smith, M.A. ∙ Kohn, A. Spatial and temporal scales of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex J. Neurosci. 2008; 28 :12591-12603 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ), temporal correlations across pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons decayed with distance ( Figure 7 A), demonstrating an association between spatial proximity and temporal coactivation within the context of the task.
To assess whether neurons’ responsiveness to trials varied as a function of their distance from the pial surface, we quantified the population variance of trial-averaged waveforms to capture the magnitudes of neuron responses, including those both excited and inhibited at each time point. More deeply situated neurons (further from pial surface) exhibited greater response magnitude ( Figures 7 B and 7C).
In addition to trial responsiveness, task-related information was heterogeneously distributed across the cortical laminar axis, with more deeply situated neurons exhibiting greater selectivity for response and outcome during the ITI ( Figures 7 D and 7E). We analyzed variance in response and outcome coding along the dorso-ventral axis, testing for differences between the prelimbic and infralimbic subregions, but we observed no such differences (data not shown).
The findings of greater trial responsiveness and greater selectivity for trial response and outcome in deeper neurons led us to look for a potential mechanism by which deep neurons might exhibit stronger coding of task-critical variables than superficial neurons. To address whether deep and superficial neurons have differential inputs, we used a rabies tracing approach, targeting EnvA-G-deleted rabies-mCherry to PFC projection neurons in spatially restricted deep or superficial injections ( Figure 7 F). We began by comparing the distributions of cells labeled by deep versus superficial injections as a function of their distance from the corresponding PFC injection sites. Because this comparison revealed a significant difference that was driven by neurons located between 1 and 2 mm from the PFC injection coordinates ( Figure 7 G, left), we next identified which regions were occupied by labeled neurons within this range ( Figure 7 G, inset pie chart). A plurality of labeled neurons in this range were located in the caudo-ventral portion of the ACC, and deep PFC injections labeled more cells in caudo-ventral ACC than superficial PFC injections ( Figures 7 G, left, and 7H). Although relatively large numbers of labeled cells were seen in secondary motor cortex (M2), caudo-dorsal ACC, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, medial + lateral), no significant differences were seen across animals by injection site in these regions. Given that ACC has been identified as an area critical for both set-shifting behavior and reward-related feedback monitoring in previous studies ( Bissonette et al., 2013 11. Bissonette, G.B. ∙ Powell, E.M. ∙ Roesch, M.R. Neural structures underlying set-shifting: roles of medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex Behav. Brain Res. 2013; 250 :91-101 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hyman et al., 2017 38. Hyman, J. ∙ Holroyd, C. ∙ Seamans, J. A Novel Neural Prediction Error Found in Anterior Cingulate Cortex Ensembles Neuron. 2017; 95 :447-456.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), this enriched input from caudo-ventral ACC to deep PFC projection neurons provides a potential source of input driving the stronger representation of trial-feedback-related information seen in the deeper neurons. While other regions showed trends toward differences in the number and spatial distribution of inputs to deep and superficial PFC projection neurons that were evident in data pooled across animals, these differences were not significant across animals ( Figure S6 ).
As a further test of the association between laminar depth and stronger coding of response and outcome signals, we leveraged the selective viral tropism of two separate PFC-MDT projection populations ( Figure 7 I): one layer 5 population, for which rAAV2 has strong tropism, heretofore referred to simply as PFC-MDT and hereafter referred to as PFC(L5)-MDT; and one in layer 6, for which canine adenovirus (CAV2) has strong tropism, hereafter referred to as PFC(L6)-MDT ( Collins et al., 2018 20. Collins, D.P. ∙ Anastasiades, P.G. ∙ Marlin, J.J. ... Reciprocal Circuits Linking the Prefrontal Cortex with Dorsal and Ventral Thalamic Nuclei Neuron. 2018; 98 :366-379.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used these two viruses as Cre expression vectors to selectively label the two populations with GCaMP6f and compared their selectivity for response and outcome during the ITI. PFC(L6)-MDT neurons showed greater response and outcome selectivity than either PFC(5)-MDT or PFC-VMS neurons and exhibited the same within-population spatial gradient seen in PFC(L5)-MDT and PFC-VMS neurons ( Figure 7 J). This finding was consistent across multiple statistical approaches that assessed the task feature selectivity of projection neurons as a function of their distance from the laminar surface ( Figure S8 ). Together, these results reveal a potential source of explanatory variance for the functional heterogeneity seen in PFC neurons during set-shifting. These neurons form a topological gradient, with deeper neurons exhibiting more trial responsiveness and stronger selectivity for trial response and outcome , potentially driven by differences in their afferent connectivity profiles and in particular by differential innervation by the caudo-ventral ACC.

Section: Discussion

We began this study with the aim of more clearly resolving the circuit-level mechanisms by which prefrontal activity uses attentional sets to provide context-dependent modulation of sensorimotor processing in set-shifting tasks. The attentional set model of prefrontal involvement in cognitive flexibility, built upon decades of influential literature with thousands of citations, frames the PFC as a mediator of top-down cognitive control, which, in the context of an attentional set-shifting task, would facilitate the filtering of multimodal sensory inputs and the biasing of corresponding motor responses in accordance with context-dependent task rules. Instead, what we present is a very different model for PFC involvement in set-shifting. Rather than modulating attention in real time, PFC output neurons serve to integrate and maintain representations of recent behaviors and their consequences.
While some prior pharmacological silencing studies found that PFC activity is critical for recall, but not acquisition, of rule switching, and that PFC activity was not critical for rule switches once the rules became familiar ( Rich and Shapiro, 2007 61. Rich, E. ∙ Shapiro, M. Prelimbic/Infralimbic Inactivation Impairs Memory for Multiple Task Switches, But Not Flexible Selection of Familiar Tasks J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :4747-4755 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), those experiments were performed in spatial tasks with changing navigation rules, which may not explicitly engage attention or suppression of irrelevant sensory cues in the same way that a cross-modal, set-shifting task does. This task difference may account for the result of the muscimol experiment in the present study, which does find PFC activity to be necessary for switch acquisition, as well as for continued performance of rule shifts after overtraining.
We note that the timing of rule shifts, triggered by criterion performance, means that anticipation of these rule shifts cannot be ruled out. However, such a strategy would necessarily involve acquisition of the new rule as a predicate for anticipation of the change, and it would therefore not eliminate the requirement for any of the key cognitive components of the task. Moreover, the evidence of rule-guided performance ( Figure 1 F) and the failure of animals to immediately abandon the previous rule following a rule shift ( Figure 1 G) argue against such a confound. We also note that while the training sequence used to expose animals to multiple task rules and stimulus exemplars is based on standard protocols that have been well validated by earlier set-shifting studies ( Birrell and Brown, 2000 8. Birrell, J.M. ∙ Brown, V.J. Medial frontal cortex mediates perceptual attentional set shifting in the rat J. Neurosci. 2000; 20 :4320-4324 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Bissonette et al., 2008 10. Bissonette, G.B. ∙ Martins, G.J. ∙ Franz, T.M. ... Double dissociation of the effects of medial and orbital prefrontal cortical lesions on attentional and affective shifts in mice J. Neurosci. 2008; 28 :11124-11130 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tait et al., 2014 78. Tait, D.S. ∙ Chase, E.A. ∙ Brown, V.J. Attentional set-shifting in rodents: a review of behavioural methods and pharmacological results Curr. Pharm. Des. 2014; 20 :5046-5059 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), we did not specifically test the effect of each training step on the physiology of behavioral strategy used in the final task. Nevertheless, the essential cognitive requirements of the task, as well as the performance data analyzed both with and without perturbation ( Figures 1 C and 1G), strongly support the conclusion that the protocol achieves comparable results and engages the same cognitive strategy as the protocols on which this task is based.
The finding of retrospective and persistent representation of response and outcome signals, modulated by the demands of the task, is not without precedent. For example, Sul et al. (2010) 77. Sul, J. ∙ Kim, H. ∙ Huh, N. ... Distinct roles of rodent orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex in decision making Neuron. 2010; 66 :449-460 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar found that the behavioral response in a two-armed bandit task was not represented in PFC activity in advance of the choice, but this was in an explicit test of reinforcement learning and choice valuation. The attentional set model of PFC involvement in set-shifting predicts that representations of rule , whisker/odor stimuli , and corresponding response should be activated during decision-making in order to modulate motor responses in downstream structures, such as striatum, thalamus, and periaqueduct gray matter.
Responsibility for modulating attention, possibly by active suppression of irrelevant stimuli, may be borne by regions with known involvement in multisensory integration—it was this hypothesis that led us to inhibit PPC activity during stimulus presentation. This perturbation did interfere with performance on ICG, but not CG, trials, lending support to the hypothesis.
Future work will seek to elucidate potential neuromodulatory and plasticity-related mechanisms behind these signals. Given the high density of input from the cholinergic nuclei of the basal forebrain that synapse on to these projection neurons ( Figure S6 B), and the established relationship between the central acetylcholine neuromodulatory system and attention-mediated behavior ( Ljubojevic et al., 2014 42. Ljubojevic, V. ∙ Luu, P. ∙ De Rosa, E. Cholinergic contributions to supramodal attentional processes in rats J. Neurosci. 2014; 34 :2264-2275 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Proulx et al., 2014 60. Proulx, E. ∙ Piva, M. ∙ Tian, M.K. ... Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in attention circuitry: the role of layer VI neurons of prefrontal cortex Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71 :1225-1244 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), the possibility that acetylcholine plays a key role in mediating these feedback-monitoring signals remains strong.
It is important to note also that the enhanced task responsiveness of deeply situated neurons may result from physiological mechanisms other than differential long-range inputs. Such correlates, which may include differential expression of neuromodulatory receptors, may provide a causal link between laminar position and task responsiveness and will be investigated in future work. Moreover, caution must be used in extending conclusions from rodent to primate cognition models, particularly in cases where, as in this study, the functional homology of the circuitry in question has itself been the subject of substantial debate.

Male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) were used for all experiments, aged 6-10 weeks at first use. Mice were housed in a Weill Cornell Medical College facility and were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle. Except when water-restricted for the purpose of behavioral training and testing, all mice were given ad libitum access to food and water. Littermates underwent prism or fiber implant surgeries within the same week, and mice were group-housed with littermates with the same surgery status. All procedures were approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine IACUC. Sample sizes for each experiment were determined using power analysis estimates computed in MATLAB, based on anticipated effect sizes that were estimated from previously published reports whenever they were available, and were powered to detect moderate, biologically meaningful effect sizes.
Animals were placed inside a flow box and anesthetized with isoflurane gas (2%) until sedated, at which point they were placed in a stereotax and maintained on 0.5% isoflurane for the duration of the surgery. Scalp hair was trimmed away, and a midline incision was made using fine surgical scissors (Fine Science Tools), exposing the skull. The periosteum was bluntly dissected away and bupivacaine (0.05 mL, 5 mg/kg) was topically applied. For prism implantation, a large rectangular craniotomy was made above left PFC, extending from 1.5mm anterior to 3.7mm anterior, and from 2.0mm lateral (left) to 0.2mm lateral (right, across midline).
A 0.5-mm burr (Fine Science Tools) and a high-speed hand dental drill (Osada) were used, taking great care not to compress brain tissue or damage the sagittal venous sinus. In the event of venous bleeding, Gelfoam (Pfizer) was applied to the dura surface to accelerate clotting. Gentle irrigation with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 10 mM phosphate buffer, VWR) was used to clear debris at regular intervals. The dura beneath the craniotomy was removed using the tip of a 26 g insulin syringe (VWR) and fine forceps (Fine Science Tools).
Chronically implanted microprisms (1.5mm X 1.5mm X 3mm; M/L,A/P,D/V), from OptoSigma (BK7 borosilicate glass with aluminum hypotenuse and silicon dioxide coating), were implanted at a depth of 2.3mm ventral to brain surface using a stereotaxic micromanipulator (Kopf). During implantation, the prism was held in place using vacuum suction via an 18G blunt needle. As in previous studies ( Andermann et al., 2013 3. Andermann, M.L. ∙ Gilfoy, N.B. ∙ Goldey, G.J. ... Chronic cellular imaging of entire cortical columns in awake mice using microprisms Neuron. 2013; 80 :900-913 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ; Low et al., 2014 43. Low, R.J. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Tank, D.W. Cellular resolution optical access to brain regions in fissures: imaging medial prefrontal cortex and grid cells in entorhinal cortex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :18739-18744 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) minimal reactive gliosis was seen in the coronal imaging field, and maximum calcium-mediated fluorescence was seen 50-150 μm past the prism face; therefore imaging planes were confined to this depth.
For PFC-VMS and PFC-MDT projection targeting, an additional craniotomy was made at 1.25mm/1.25mm A/L or 1.2mm/0.35mm P/L, respectively. All head-fixed animals received custom-machined stainless steel head plates affixed to skull surface with Metabond dental cement. Head plates featured a circular central aperture centered around the imaging field (9mm I.D.), with right and left securing arms (25mm total width) that accommodated 0-80 socket screws (0.38 g in total). Sterile eye lubricant (Puralube, FischerSci) was administered to prevent corneal drying, and a microwavable heating pad (Snugglesafe) was used to maintain body temperature. Metacam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered after surgery as a prophylactic analgesic.
AAV of titer exceeding 10 12 vg/ml (Vector Biolabs, UNC Vector Core and Addgene) was used to package the plasmids. For imaging experiments, AAV1-hSyn-GCaMP6f or AAV1-hSyn-DIO-GCaMP6f ( Chen et al., 2013 18. Chen, T. ∙ Wardill, T. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity Nature. 2013; 499 :295-300 Crossref Scopus (4198) PubMed Google Scholar ) was targeted to PFC. Injection coordinates for PFC were 1.75mm anterior. Two parallel injection tracks were made at 0.2mm and 0.5mm lateral, and in each of these tracks, two D/V sites received infusions, at 2.0mm and 1.5mm ventral to brain surface. For rAAV2-Cre projection targeting, VMS injections were delivered at 1.25mm/1.25mm/4.7mm A/L/V, and MDT injections at 1.2mm/0.35mm/3.2mm P/L/V. Hamilton syringes and beveled 36G or 33G NanoFil needles (WPI) were used, and at each site, the needle was allowed to sit 5min to allow for tissue settling before infusion. Virus was infused at a rate of 50nL/min, for a total of 250nL per site.
For the dual labeling tracing experiment ( Figure 5 B), rAAV2-mGreenLantern ( Campbell et al., 2020 16. Campbell, B. ∙ Nabel, E. ∙ Murdock, M. ... mGreenLantern: a bright monomeric fluorescent protein with rapid expression and cell filling properties for neuronal imaging Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :30710-30721 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) was injected in MDT (500nL), CAV-FLP was injected in VMS (500nL), and AAV9-CAG-F3/FRT-NLS-tdTomato-WPRE was injected in PFC (500nL).
Animals received chronically implanted 26G bilateral stainless steel guide cannulae (Plastics One), implanted at 1.75mm/0.35mm/1mm A/L/V. After undergoing the training and task transition sequence up to and including Reversal (see behavioral training protocol below), animals underwent muscimol infusion. In a familiar cage, bilateral internal infusion cannulae were inserted into the guide cannulae, protruding 0.5mm from the end of the guide cannulae, and were left for 5min to allow tissue to settle. Muscimol (1 μg/μL) or physiological saline (0.9%) was infused at a rate of 50nL/min, for a total of 0.25 μL. Five minutes after completion of the infusion, the internal cannulae were removed and the mouse immediately began behavioral testing.
Bilateral fibers were implanted over PFC (Thorlabs dual fiber cannulae, 700 μm center-to-center spacing, 200 μm core) at 0.35mm lateral, 1.75 anterior, 1.2mm ventral to brain surface. In the posterior parietal cortex inhibition cohort, in order to cover the medial-lateral extent of PPC, a dual-fiber cannula (700 μm center-to-center spacing) was placed over each hemisphere, so that both right and left PPC each had two 200 μm-core fibers. The dual fiber cannulae were positioned on the brain surface with the dura intact, at a ML angle of 10° away from midline, with the medial fiber at AP −1.8mm, ML +1.0mm, and the lateral fiber at AP −1.8mm, ML +1.7mm. Light was delivered via Thorlabs M470F3 fiber-coupled LED, 1.5-3mW light power from each fiber. In the trial-concurrent stimulation condition, photoactivation was initiated at the same time as the 500ms trial-ready cue and persisted through the 2.5 s stimulus presentation epoch until either a lick terminated the trial or the 1.5 s response period expired. In the inter-trial interval stimulation conditions, photoactivation was initiated concurrently with the end of the trial (first lick within the response window or upon the conclusion of the 1.5 s response window without a lick) and persisted through the 8-10 s post-trial epoch, terminating with the onset of the subsequent trial-ready cue. In the experiment testing the effects of inhibition during the beginning of the inter-trial interval, the photoactivation was initiated concurrently with lickspout selection and persisted for 4.5 s before terminating; in the experiment testing the effects of inhibition during the end of the inter-trial interval, photoactivation was initiated beginning at 4.5 s following lickspout selection, persisting for the remainder of the 8-10 s inter-trial interval. Light was delivered in alternating trial blocks, beginning with the second block of the session (no light delivered in the initial block). Sessions in which animals failed to reach criterion on the initial block were re-run until the animal reached criterion.

All images were acquired using a commercial two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Olympus RS) equipped with a scanning galvanometer and a Spectra-Physics Mai Tai DeepSee laser tuned to 920nm, operating at 300-500mW. Fluorescence was recorded through gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) detectors using the Fluoview acquisition software (Olympus) using a green light emission bandpass filter (Semrock). Imaging sessions began by performing an isosbestic anatomical scan (810nm 2P excitation light) to aid in relocating the same sites over multiple sessions. Calcium signals were acquired at 256 × 130 pixel resolution, covering a 1500 μm X 760 μm field of view, with a μm/pixel ratio of 5.85. The scan time was 346ms, with a frame rate of 2.89Hz. All calcium imaging experiments occurred in awake mice. For analysis of SEDS sessions, sessions were concatenated using CellReg ( Sheintuch et al., 2017 70. Sheintuch, L. ∙ Rubin, A. ∙ Brande-Eilat, N. ... Tracking the Same Neurons across Multiple Days in Ca 2+ Imaging Data Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :1102-1115 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ) and non-rigid spatial transformation (see Videos S1 and S2 for examples). Neurons were modeled with a maximal centroid distance of 15 μm and a threshold correlation of 0.65. Z-scoring of deconvolved activity traces was performed prior to concatenating across sessions. SEDS neural datasets for each of 21 animals are comprised of a median of 3 sessions (2.5,4 upper, lower quartiles), 1462 trials (1034, 1667 upper, lower quartiles), and 11 set shifts (8.5, 17.5 upper, lower quartiles).

Videos were motion-corrected using NoRMCorre ( Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017 57. Pnevmatikakis, E.A. ∙ Giovannucci, A.

Methods. 2017; 291 :83-94 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in MATLAB (Mathworks), and a constrained non-negative matrix factorization-based source extraction method was used to denoise, deconvolve and demix the videos to extract neural traces (using the extensively validated CNMF-E package ( Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016 58.

Friedrich, J. ∙ Zhou, P. ∙ Paninski, L. Fast online deconvolution of calcium imaging data PLoS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13 :e1005423 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sources were well separated from both neighboring sources and surrounding neuropil, as assessed by performing PCA analysis of putative source and surrounding pixels over time and quantifying their isolation distances ( Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005 66.

Stringer, C. ∙ Pachitariu, M. Computational processing of neural recordings from calcium imaging data Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2019; 55 :22-31 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting traces were deconvolved calcium traces corresponding with estimated event rates, which were then z-scored over the full session to normalize. Calcium signals from sequential sessions were concatenated using non-rigid co-registration of spatial cell footprints using CellReg ( Crowe and Ellis-Davies, 2014 22. Crowe, S.E. ∙ Ellis-Davies, G.C.

Animals recovered 14 days from surgery before being placed on water restriction for four days, after which they typically drank 1-1.2mL/day. Behavioral training and testing procedures were carried out 5 days per week, with each animal undergoing one session per day. Animals underwent two days of hand-feeding, in which they were handled for up to ten minutes by the experimenter while receiving water from a 1mL syringe with a rounded stainless steel gavage needle.
Following two days of hand-feeding, animals underwent a Habituation-1 session in the behavioral apparatus, which consisted of an aluminum restraint tube with dual lickspouts positioned at one end. The restraint tube was 27mm in diameter, a width calibrated to allow the animal to groom and adjust its posture during sessions but which prevented significant lateral or vertical body movement. During Habituation-1 , lickspouts were alternately armed so that a single lick would trigger delivery of a 3uL water bolus, and the identity of the armed lickspout changed every 1-4 trials, with a 1.5 s timeout after each bolus delivery. This alternating schedule forced the animal to explore both lickspouts equally to maximize rewards. Animals would periodically venture out of the restraint tube to explore the behavior chamber, at which point the experimenter would guide them back into the tube by hand. The session terminated when the animal stopped licking for ∼2min, and the animal was considered to have passed this stage when it had consumed 500 μL in a session.
After passing Habituation-1, animals underwent a Habituation-2 stage, which consisted of the same lick/dispense schedule as Habituation-1, but during which the animal was head-restrained for the first time. Here again, the animal needed to consume 500 μL to pass.
After Habituation-2, animals underwent Habituation-3 , in which lickspouts alternated every 20 lick/delivery trials, to establish left/right trial blocks. As with Habituation-1 and −2, animals were considered to have passed this stage after consuming 500 μL of water.
After this, animals underwent a Shaping-1 session, which introduced the trial structure to be used for the rest of the sessions: a 500ms white noise trial-start cue was presented, followed by a 2.5 s stimulus (whisker or odor, depending on the training sequence, which was counter-balanced across animals in the calcium imaging experiment), followed by a ≤ 1.5 s response window, during which the correct lickspout was armed. When the response rate fell to between 0.3 and 0.6 within a 10-trial moving window, reward would be dispensed regardless of whether the animal licked, in order to promote licking. Trials were blocked (20 right, 20 left), and a lick to the incorrect side would not terminate the trial; the animal was allowed to continue until it licked the correct spout. At the start of each trial block, a single 3uL reward was dispensed at the now-rewarded spout. Criterion for passing Shaping-1 was 500 μL consumed.
Shaping-2 differed from Shaping-1 in that trials were randomized between sides rather than blocked. Criterion here, and for all remaining sessions up to SEDS, was reaching 80% correct within a 30-trial moving window, and simultaneously performing above 50% on both left and right trials, at any point within the session.
To counteract animals’ tendency to sporadically exhibit stereotyped direction bias, left/right stimulus probability was dynamically computed as a function of the animal’s concurrent direction bias coefficient. A 10-trial moving window was populated with a [-1] for each incorrect left response, a [1] for each incorrect right response, and a [0] for each correct response. For each trial, the coefficient was the mean over the 10 previous trials. A coefficient absolute value between 0 and 0.25 resulted in 50% left-right stimulus probability; an absolute value between 0.25 and 0.75 resulted in a 33% chance of a stimulus toward the direction of bias; an absolute value between 0.75 and 1 resulted in a 17% chance of a stimulus toward the direction of bias. Trial runs with lick bias coefficients greater than 0.75 were therefore excluded from analysis.
Of the 21 mice included in the imaging experiment, 14 underwent initial training with whisker stimuli, and 7 underwent initial training with odor stimuli. Subsequent comparison of stimulus encoding did not indicate any discernible differences between these two groups following the extradimensional set-shift. It should be noted that the hearing range of mice is 1-80kHz ( Turner et al., 2005 80. Turner, J. ∙ Parrish, J. ∙ Hughes, L. ... Hearing in Laboratory Animals: Strain Differences and Nonauditory Effects of Noise Comp. Med. 2005; 55 :12-23 PubMed Google Scholar ), which falls outside the range of the stimuli used to vibrate the whiskers.
For animals undergoing SD with whisker stimuli, stimuli consisted of a 35Hz sinusoidal stimulus and a 155Hz sinusoidal stimulus. The 35Hz and 155Hz stimuli were delivered bilaterally. These stimuli were generated by a pair of miniature base-frequency audio speakers (2” diameter) coupled to a pair of plastic funnels which served to condense the sound waves into a 5mm diameter compression wave (75 dB). These stimuli produced oscillatory deflections of a majority of whiskers on the order of 10°, and active whisking was routinely observed during these epochs.
Odor stimuli consisted of murine-appetitive oil extracts. For the 7 mice undergoing initial training with odor stimuli, these stimuli were olive oil and sesame oil. The odor port was positioned 5mm below the animal’s nostrils, with the airflow directed up toward the nostrils. Air was delivered through this port at a rate of 2.5 l per minute through 1/32” inner-diameter polytetrafluoroethylene tubing. Outside of the odor stimulus epochs, clean air was delivered continuously through the odor port. At the onset of the odor stimulus epoch, air was rerouted through chambers containing the oil extracts, so that clean air was completely displaced by air from the oil container within 30ms.
Each trial began with a 500ms audible white noise (2kHz-17kHz) to indicate the start of a trial. Immediately following this cue, a whisker and/or odor stimulus (depending on the task phase as outlined in the table in Figure 1 and descriptions below) were presented for 2.5sec. The animal was permitted to lick the water spouts freely during stimulus presentation, though these anticipatory licks did not terminate the stimulus or trigger reward. Following the 2.5sec stimulus delivery, there was a response window of up to 1.5sec during which a lick to either port would end the trial, trigger delivery of a 3 μL water droplet (on correct trials), and begin the inter-trial interval. As shown in Figure 1 B, licking toward the ultimately chosen lick port began well before the termination of the stimulus, and 95% of responses came within the first 0.346ms of the response window, a latency that corresponded with the first frame of imaging following stimulus termination.
For the 14 mice undergoing initial training with whisker stimuli, on each trial a bilateral whisker vibration stimulus (one of two possible patterns) was delivered. Through water reward-mediated reinforcement, mice learned to lick the left lick port in response to the 35Hz stimulus and the right lick port in response to the 155Hz stimulus. For the 7 mice undergoing initial training with odor stimuli, animals learned to lick left in response to an olive oil odorant and right in response to a sesame oil odorant. Sessions consisted of up to 350 trials, and sessions were terminated early if an animal failed to respond to ten consecutive trials. An animal was considered to have reached criterion for the SD phase if at any point during a session it reached 80% correct performance, and simultaneously ≥ 50% correct on both left and right trials, within a 30-trial moving window. The SD phase tests the animal’s ability to learn a stimulus-reward contingency and discriminate between two stimuli from the same dimension (i.e., two odors or two whisker stimuli). When criterion was reached, the current session continued to its end (up to 350 trials), and the animal was moved on to the subsequent task phase on the following session.
An irrelevant stimulus (odor stimulus for mice initially trained on whisker stimuli and vice versa) was added on each trial. Both relevant and irrelevant stimuli were randomly and independently chosen for each trial. The same criterion standard was used as with SD: 80% correct performance (and at least 50% on both right and left trials) within any 30-trial moving window.
A new pair of relevant stimuli replaced the stimuli used for SD and CD, while the irrelevant stimuli remained unchanged. For animals initially trained on whisker stimuli, the new stimuli were a 210Hz sinusoid (lick-left) and a train of Poisson-distributed square-wave clicks averaging 210Hz (lick-right). For animals initially trained on the odor rule, the new stimuli were almond oil (lick-left) and orange extract (lick-right). This phase tests the animal’s ability to learn a new stimulus-reward contingency and discriminate between two new stimuli from the same task-relevant dimension. The criterion for passing IDS was the same as for SD and CD.
The same set of relevant and irrelevant stimuli were used as in IDS, but the left-right mapping was reversed. This phase requires the animal to suppress and replace a previously learned stimulus-response contingency. Criterion was the same as in SD, CD, and IDS.
The same whisker and odor stimuli were used as in IDS and Rev, but the previously irrelevant modality now became the relevant modality and vice versa. Because relevant and irrelevant stimuli were randomly and independently chosen on each trial, 50% of trials were congruent and 50% were incongruent. This phase requires the animal to associate a new stimulus category , the previously irrelevant stimulus modality, with a left-right response mapping. Criterion was the same as in all preceding task phases.
The stimuli in the newly relevant modality were replaced, while those in the newly irrelevant modality were unchanged. This phase serves to ensure that the animal has learned to associate left-right stimulus mappings with multiple exemplar sets in each modality, thereby establishing an abstract attentional set within the newly relevant modality. Criterion was the same as in all preceding task phases.
For each SEDS session, the relevant stimulus modality was chosen randomly at the start of the session. Stimuli during these sessions were the same stimuli used in the IDS2 phase (whisker: 210Hz sinusoid, left, and Poisson click train, right; odor: almond oil, left, and orange extract, right). Upon reaching criterion (still 80% correct and 50% on both left and right in a 30-trial moving window), the modality rule was automatically switched. This phase tests the animal’s ability to integrate trial feedback to flexibly switch between task rules. As with previous phases, relevant and irrelevant stimuli were randomly and independently generated on each trial. To maximize the number of set-shifts in each session, sessions continued until animals reached satiety (ten consecutive non-response trials) or consumed 1.1mL of water.
Animals were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1x PBS. Heads were removed and incubated with all tissues intact in 4% PFA at 6°C. Brains were dissected after 24 hours and fixed in 4% PFA for an additional 24 hours before being dehydrated in a 30% sucrose solution (24-72 hours, until submerged). Tissue was sectioned coronally (in 45 μm sections) at −20°C and submerged in PBS until mounting. (When not in the cryostat tissue was stored at 6°C). Samples were mounted on 25x75x1 mm slides (Cole Parmer or Fisher Superfrost) with Sigma brand, DAPI-infused Fluoroshield mounting medium. For the L5 versus L6 PFC-MDT dual labeling experiment, Fluoroshield without DAPI was used, to enable BFP visualization.
Imaging was carried out on the Leica DM 5500 B microscope with a Leica DFC360 FX fluorescent camera (7x magnification) and EL600 light source, using a 10x apochromat objective with an NA of 0.4. Images were taken in two channels - the red channel used a CY3 filter cube (excitation filter 545/40, dichroic mirror 565, emission filter 610/76) at a 90ms exposure. The blue channel was captured with a DAPI filter cube (excitation 360/40, dichroic 400, emission 470/40) at a 100ms exposure. Both channels were imaged with full laser power and no gain. To allow for comparison across brain regions, both within and across animals, these imaging parameters were held constant for images gathered for the rabies tracing and fluorescent axon tracing experiments.
Images were acquired using the Leica Acquisition System (LASX) (Version 3.6) navigator feature to capture each sample as a series of 1281.71 × 957.36 um (1392x 1040 px) tiles, which were stitched (with no overlap or blending) by the software during acquisition to produce the complete image.
Monosynaptic inputs to PFC-VMS and PFC-MDT projection neurons were labeled by using a cross-sectional three-virus approach. At 4 weeks prior to sacking, AAV encoding the TVA rabies B19 glycoprotein (pAAV-EF1a-FLEX-TVA/B19) was injected into PFC. Virus was infused using a 36 g beveled NanoFil needle (WPI) and a 10 μL Hamilton syringe. Infusions of 250nL were made at each of four sites within PFC: AP +1.75mm, ML −0.2mm and −0.5mm, DV −2.0mm and −1.5mm (brain surface). Virus was infused at a rate of 50nL/min. In the same surgery, retrogradely transported rAAV2-CAG-Cre was injected into MDT (AP −1.2mm, ML −0.35mm, DV −3.2mm) or VMS (AP +1.25mm, ML −1.25mm, DV −4.7mm) in a volume of 500nL.
Following the dual infusions, Vetbond tissue adhesive was applied to the craniotomy over the exposed dura, and the skin was sutured into place using 6-0 silk sutures. Three weeks later, a second infusion surgery was performed to infuse EnvA G-Deleted Rabies-mCherry in PFC. Using a Nanoject nanoliter injector and a borosilicate pulled glass micropipette, 50nL of virus was infused at either a cortically superficial (ML −0.3mm) or deep (ML −0.6mm) site (AP +1.75, DV −1.7). The animal was again sutured and allowed to recover 1 week before sacking.
Surgical preparation, craniotomy, and infusion procedures were the same as those for GCaMP and stGtACR2 projection labeling experiments. AAV1-CAG-DIO-tdTomato was infused in PFC at four sites: AP +1.75mm, ML −0.2mm and −0.5mm, DV −2.0mm and −1.5mm, at a volume of 250nL per site and a rate of 50nL/min. rAAV2-CAG-Cre (500nL) was infused in MDT (AP −1.2mm, ML −0.35mm, DV −3.2mm) or VMS (AP +1.25mm, ML −1.25mm, DV −4.7mm) in a volume of 500nL. Animals were sutured and allowed to recover for four weeks before sacking.
Coronal slices were mounted and imaged from ∼AP +3mm to ∼AP −4mm, spanning the frontal pole of the neocortex to the ventral/caudal hippocampus and surrounding regions. Imaging was performed at 1 μm/pixel resolution and tiled using Leica software. Image cropping, alignment, de-warping, registration to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework ( Wang et al., 2020 81. Wang, Q. ∙ Ding, S. ∙ Li, Y. ... The Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework: A 3D Reference Atlas Cell. 2020; 181 :936-953.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ), and annotation of cell locations was performed using custom MATLAB algorithms adapted in part from the cortex-lab/allenCCF package ( Shamash et al., 2018 68. Shamash, P. ∙ Carandini, M. ∙ Harris, K. ... A tool for analyzing electrode tracks from slice histology BioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Histological images were mapped to corresponding atlas sections by annotating images with manual control points and generating piecewise regression image transformations (MATLAB fitgeotrans ). Individual labeled neurons were then individually annotated in MATLAB and mapped onto atlas locations using the Allen CCF structure tree (data.cortexlab.net/allenCCF).
AAV1-hSyn-stGtACR2-FusionRed was infused in PFC (AP +1.75mm, ML −0.2mm / −0.5mm, DV −2.0mm / −1.5mm, 250nL/site). Animals were sutured and allowed to recover for 4 weeks. On the day of the recording session, they were anesthetized under isoflurane (2%) and transitioned to 0.5% isoflurane over a 20min monitoring period. The craniotomy from the earlier viral transfusion was widened to an area of ∼2mm x 2mm. A 32-channel silicon probe, coupled to a 200 μm-core, 0.6NA optical fiber (H6b-style optrode, Cambridge Neurotech) was lowered into the brain at a rate of ∼100 μm/min to a depth of 1.7mm ventral at the tip. Recording were gathered using an Intan analog-to-digital acquisition system. Spikes were sampled at 20KHz with a 1Hz high-pass filter and 60Hz notch filter, and recording channels were referenced against an alligator clip secured to the neck muscle. Raw voltage recordings were later bandpass filtered between 250Hz and 20KHz using MATLAB’d bandpass function, and multiunit spiking activity was thresholded at −0.1mV.
Anesthesia was administered as described above in the photoactivation experiment. A larger (∼2mm ML x ∼3mm AP) craniotomy was opened over frontal cortex. The animal’s head was raised in order to provide a flat (rather than sloped) cortical surface over frontal areas. A multielectrode array (Innovative Neurophysiology Inc.) was arrayed in two rows of 8, spaced at 150 μm between columns and rows. The rows were arranged along the AP axis, with the most anterior recording site at AP +2.0mm, DV −0.5mm. and the two rows at 0.3mm and 0.5mm left of the midline. Muscimol (1 μg/μL) was infused at a rate of 50nL/min, for a total of 0.25 μL, through a 36 g needle positioned in between the most anterior pair of electrodes and angled 10° toward the anterior. Spontaneous activity during and following infusion was recorded and processed with the same settings as in the photoactivation experiment described above.
To estimate latent population activity associated with each task variable on a trial-to-trial basis, we used an unsupervised tensor component analysis (TCA) approach ( Williams et al., 2018 82. Williams, A.H. ∙ Kim, T.H. ∙ Wang, F. ... Unsupervised Discovery of Demixed, Low-Dimensional Neural Dynamics across Multiple Timescales through Tensor Component Analysis Neuron. 2018; 98 :1099-1115.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trial-aligned z-scored activity traces (trial x neuron x time) were first normalized to a nonnegative range and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel. They were then decomposed into a set of related trial, neuron, and temporal factors. We evaluated models using both standard TCA and nonnegative TCA, in which weights are constrained to positive values, ultimately selecting nonnegative TCA as it provided a more consistent fit. The trial components of these factors were then regressed onto the five primary task variables (whisker, odor, response, outcome, and rule) using MATLAB’s glmfit function. Factors that were significantly modulated (Bonferroni corrected t test) by a given variable in the trial domain were then pooled to estimate temporal profiles for latent population activity underlying each task variable. Tensor reconstruction was performed by performing matrix multiplication on the component neuron ∗ factor, trial ∗ factor, and time ∗ factor matrices. Temporal components shown in Figure 2 G are from factors found to be associated with each task variable with a p value < 10e 10 using the GLM. This stringent criterion was used in order to include only the top 5% of most reliably modulated factors. Less stringent criteria resulted in the inclusion of factors with a high variance among temporal components.
To evaluate the intrinsic dimensionality of the data, decomposition ranks were compared across a range from 4 to 60; a maximal decomposition was also performed using a rank of R = N, where N was the number of neurons in each session, and used to benchmark the reconstruction error at lower ranks ( Figure S8 ). The data were high-dimensional, with a high reconstruction error even with large rank values and without clear inflection points in the rank-error or rank-similarity functions ( Figure S8 B). To identify models that revealed task-related latent features, we also compared the accuracy of SVM decoders trained to classify features from trial components extracted with a range of rank values ( Figure S8 C), and found that classification accuracy increased with higher model ranks, approaching a plateau point around 35 factors. We compared the dynamics of the temporal components associated with feature prediction and found that, across a wide range of model ranks, the temporal profile presented in Figure 2 G remains consistent ( Figure S8 D).
Population decoding was performed with maximum-margin linear decoders (MATLAB fitcsvm). At each iteration data were separated (bootstrapped) into equally sized training and testing sets, and in each set, trials were separated into equal numbers from each binary value for the feature of interest. To combine inputs from neurons across multiple sessions, and to remove inter-trial variability each of these trial groups was than randomly separated into 16 trial groups, each of which was averaged into one super-trial to serve as a decoder input (16 super-trials for one value of the feature of interest and 16 from the opposing value, for a total of 32 observations per model training). This number was calibrated to ensure robust trial subsampling within training and testing sets while removing sufficient trial variability to permit accurate decoding. Standard deviations for classification accuracy were obtained by iterating randomized training and testing over 500 subsamplings with replacement. Decoder testing performed on data from inter-trial intervals was run on binned activity values averaged over the 8 s post response epoch unless otherwise specified.
PCA was used to identify the trial-aligned activity patterns responsible for the greatest variance within the activity space of the neural traces ( Figure 5 J). PCA was performed using MATLAB’s native pca function, and the first three resulting components were plotted through trial-aligned time. PCA was performed separately on trial-averaged traces from PFC-VMS and PFC-MDT sets (neuron x time).
MATLAB’s fitglm function was used to fit a GLM model to projection cell type and topological location (depth from pial surface). Fitglm was also used to model multiple single neuron activity as a function of 7 task variables: whisker stimulus, odor stimulus, response direction (current trial), response direction (previous trial), trial outcome (current trial), trial outcome (previous trial), and task rule. Unless otherwise specified, GLMs were modeled with normal distributions, as linear functions (no interaction effects) with y-intercept terms, and with identity linkages. For analysis of individual neuron responses to task variables, a separate GLM was computed performed for each time point in the trial independently. ̂ 𝑌 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 ⁢ 𝑝 + 𝛽 2 ⁢ 𝑑 + 𝛽 3 ⁢ 𝑝 ⋅ 𝑑
Euclidean distance between pairs of trial averaged conditions was computed as the square root of the sum of the differences between the two conditions across all neurons in the set. 𝑑 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑦 = √ ∑ 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 Euclidean distance was also computed on activity vectors scaled by the vector weights of their corresponding SVM decoders in order to scale the amplitude of feature-selective cells relative to noise. Vector angles were computed as the dot product of the difference vectors, divided by the product of their norms. This value was converted into an angle of degrees by taking its inverse cosine. 𝜃 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑦 = c o s − 1 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ⋅ 𝑦 ) ÷ ( ‖ 𝑥 ‖ ⋅ ‖ 𝑦 ‖ )
