Title: ER-to-Golgi protein delivery through an interwoven, tubular network extending from ER


Abstract: Summary

Cellular versatility depends on accurate trafficking of diverse proteins to their organellar destinations. For the secretory pathway (followed by approximately 30% of all proteins), the physical nature of the vessel conducting the first portage (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] to Golgi apparatus) is unclear. We provide a dynamic 3D view of early secretory compartments in mammalian cells with isotropic resolution and precise protein localization using whole-cell, focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy with cryo-structured illumination microscopy and live-cell synchronized cargo release approaches. Rather than vesicles alone, the ER spawns an elaborate, interwoven tubular network of contiguous lipid bilayers (ER exit site) for protein export. This receptacle is capable of extending microns along microtubules while still connected to the ER by a thin neck. COPII localizes to this neck region and dynamically regulates cargo entry from the ER, while COPI acts more distally, escorting the detached, accelerating tubular entity on its way to joining the Golgi apparatus through microtubule-directed movement.

Section: Introduction

The secretory pathway is a foundational system used by all eukaryotic cells to distribute membrane and secretory proteins ( Barlowe and Helenius, 2016 9. Barlowe, C. ∙ Helenius, A. Cargo Capture and Bulk Flow in the Early Secretory Pathway Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 32 :197-222 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). The first portage of this pathway—protein sorting at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites (ERESs) and transit to the Golgi apparatus—is orchestrated primarily by two evolutionarily conserved protein coat complexes, COPII and COPI, which each polymerize into flexible curved scaffolds to support membrane deformation and protein sorting ( Aridor et al., 1995 5.

COPI and its regulators are proposed to further differentiate the vesicular-tubular clusters into pre-Golgi intermediates enriched in p58 ( Appenzeller et al., 1999 2.

Various aspects of this trafficking model remain unclear. Conflicting data support the formation of the vesicular tubular clusters alternatively by homotypic fusion of COPII vesicles derived from the ER ( Bannykh et al., 1996 7.

Raote, I. ∙ Malhotra, V. Protein transport by vesicles and tunnels J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218 :737-739 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) when cargo is synchronously released from ER. Another unknown is how COPI supports protein recycling to—and protein export from—the ER ( Gomez-Navarro and Miller, 2016 22. Gomez-Navarro, N. ∙ Miller, E.

Biol. 1999; 9 :821-824 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the ability of pre-Golgi intermediates to bud vesicles targeted to the Golgi continues to be uncertain, as several live-cell imaging studies have shown that these compartments themselves move as transport carriers to the Golgi ( Mironov et al., 2003 46. Mironov, A.A. ∙ Mironov, Jr., A.A. ∙ Beznoussenko, G.V. ... ER-to-Golgi carriers arise through direct en bloc protrusion and multistage maturation of specialized ER exit domains Dev.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113 :2177-2185 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Many of these concerns remain unresolved in mammalian cells due to the absence of data on the 3D ultrastructural organization of ERESs and their derived transport intermediates in intact cells at isotropic, nanoscale resolution. Prior serial thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and tomographic approaches ( Bannykh et al., 1996 7. Bannykh, S.I. ∙ Rowe, T. ∙ Balch, W.E. The organization of endoplasmic reticulum export complexes J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135 :19-35 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Horstmann et al., 2002 30.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8 :377-383 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been limited by large section thickness, small sampling volume, and potential artifacts from chemical fixation. These deficiencies have made it difficult to fully reconstruct ERESs and transport intermediates and, thus, to understand how they function in secretory trafficking.
To overcome these difficulties, we applied whole-cell focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) ( Xu et al., 2017 83. Xu, C.S. ∙ Hayworth, K.J. ∙ Lu, Z. ... Enhanced FIB-SEM systems for large-volume 3D imaging eLife. 2017; 6 :e25916 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020 84. Xu, C.S. ∙ Pang, S. ∙ Shtengel, G. ... Isotropic 3D electron microscopy reference library of whole cells and tissues bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) combined with cryogenic-structured illumination microscopy (cryo-SIM) ( Hoffman et al., 2020 29. Hoffman, D.P. ∙ Shtengel, G. ∙ Xu, C.S. ... Correlative three-dimensional super-resolution and block-face electron microscopy of whole vitreously frozen cells Science. 2020; 367 :eaaz5357 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ) to re-examine the ultrastructural features of ERESs and transport intermediates at isotropic, nanoscale resolution throughout an entire cell. To understand the functional significance of these compartments, we used Airyscan microscopy and fast confocal imaging, synchronized cargo release ( Boncompain et al., 2012 13. Boncompain, G. ∙ Divoux, S. ∙ Gareil, N. ... Synchronization of secretory protein traffic in populations of cells Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :493-498 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ), and point localization analysis to dynamically define the localization of COPII, COPI, and cargos in relation to ERESs and transport intermediates.
Our results build on and transform previous thinking in this field ( Bannykh et al., 1996 7. Bannykh, S.I. ∙ Rowe, T. ∙ Balch, W.E. The organization of endoplasmic reticulum export complexes J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135 :19-35 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gomez-Navarro and Miller, 2016 22. Gomez-Navarro, N. ∙ Miller, E. Protein sorting at the ER-Golgi interface J.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113 :2177-2185 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that ERESs consist of an intricate, tangled network of tubules connected by a neck to the ER. COPII and COPI facilitate separate steps within this receptacle, respectively acting to regulate secretory protein entrance into and departure from it. The overall size of the ERES increased in response to sudden cargo influx from ER, while its basic configuration remained unchanged. Extending off the ERESs alongside microtubules were tubular vessels with pearling shapes for protein transport to the Golgi. These vessels themselves advance toward the Golgi with no stable pre-Golgi compartments observed. Dynamic nano-anatomy reveals the ERES as an inter-organelle transport apparatus that actively modulates its shape and size while directing diverse cargo types to the Golgi.

Section: Results

We applied cryo-SIM/FIB-SEM ( Hoffman et al., 2020 29. Hoffman, D.P. ∙ Shtengel, G. ∙ Xu, C.S. ... Correlative three-dimensional super-resolution and block-face electron microscopy of whole vitreously frozen cells Science. 2020; 367 :eaaz5357 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ) to get a finer look at the 3D nano-anatomy of ERESs in mammalian cells. First, cells overexpressing fluorescent protein-tagged Sec23, a COPII coat protein known to localize at ERESs ( Gomez-Navarro and Miller, 2016 22. Gomez-Navarro, N. ∙ Miller, E. Protein sorting at the ER-Golgi interface J. Cell Biol. 2016; 215 :769-778 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peotter et al., 2019 54. Peotter, J. ∙ Kasberg, W. ∙ Pustova, I. ... COPII-mediated trafficking at the ER/ERGIC interface Traffic. 2019; 20 :491-503 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), were high-pressure frozen to preserve their near-native states avoiding artifacts from chemical fixation. Next, cryo-SIM images were taken to obtain Sec23 features, followed by freeze-substitution, resin-embedding, and whole-cell FIB-SEM imaging. Cryo-SIM images of Sec23 ( Figures 1 Ai and 1Aii) were aligned to the FIB-SEM images ( Figures 1 Aiii–1Av) enabling objective identification and analysis of ERES ultrastructure with an isotropic resolution at 4–8 nm. We found that each ERES seen by FIB-SEM, identified by a single Sec23-positive punctum in cryo-SIM images, was composed of a cluster of vesicular-tubular membranes devoid of ribosomes near the ER ( Figure 1 Aiii), consistent with previous EM studies ( Bannykh et al., 1996 7. Bannykh, S.I. ∙ Rowe, T. ∙ Balch, W.E. The organization of endoplasmic reticulum export complexes J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135 :19-35 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Horstmann et al., 2002 30. Horstmann, H. ∙ Ng, C.P. ∙ Tang, B.L. ...

Cell Biol. 1999; 144 :1135-1149 Crossref Scopus (523) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Using this specific morphological identifier, hundreds of discrete ERESs in non-transfected cells were also identified to avoid potential artifacts of Sec23 overexpression ( Figure 1 B). Segmentation through serial FIB-SEM slices and 3D rendering provided a detailed isotropic view with 4-nm resolution of single ERESs. Each individual ERES comprised a highly intertwined tubule network, continuous with the ER by a constricted neck ( Figure 1 B, right panels, and 1C; Video S1 ). While some ERESs had only a single constricted neck attaching it to the ER, others had two or more. These features of ERESs were common in COS7, U2OS, and HeLa cells. The overall diameter of the tubule network was 350–390 nm (n = 207; 7 cells), while individual tubules in the tangled network had a diameter of 40–60 nm (n = 811; 7 cells) ( Figures 1 D and 1E). The neck region of the ERES was slightly constricted compared to the diameter of tubules in the tangled network, while nearby ER tubules were substantially wider ( Figure 1 F). Altogether, these results revealed that ERESs consist of an elaborate interwoven tubule network still attached to the ER. This distinct ERES anatomy would likely have been missed in earlier serial section TEM studies ( Bannykh et al., 1996 7. Bannykh, S.I. ∙ Rowe, T. ∙ Balch, W.E. The organization of endoplasmic reticulum export complexes J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135 :19-35 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Horstmann et al., 2002 30.

ERES continuity with the ER through a narrow neck raised the question of whether some membrane proteins could circulate between the ER and ERESs at steady state. We tested this in living cells using the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) system ( Boncompain et al., 2012 13. Boncompain, G. ∙ Divoux, S. ∙ Gareil, N. ... Synchronization of secretory protein traffic in populations of cells Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :493-498 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). This approach is based on reversible ER trapping of reporter cargos appended to streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) via interaction with ER-localized streptavidin-fused “hook” proteins. Biotin addition competes the binding of streptavidin with SBP, leading to a synchronized reporter cargo release into secretory compartments. We used a transmembrane secretory protein tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) as a RUSH reporter (TNF-α-RUSH) because, before biotin addition, TNF-α-RUSH displayed an ER distribution as well as being enriched at ERESs labeled by Sec23 or Sec31 ( Figures 1 G, S1 A, and S1B) ( Fourriere et al., 2016 18. Fourriere, L. ∙ Divoux, S. ∙ Roceri, M. ... Microtubule-independent secretion requires functional maturation of Golgi elements J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 :3238-3250 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Photobleaching of TNF-α-RUSH in a single ERES in cells with no biotin addition revealed that, after photobleaching, the intensity of TNF-α-RUSH fluorescence quickly returned within the ERES, reaching near-complete recovery in tens of seconds ( Figures 1 G, 1H, S1 C, and S1D). This indicated that TNF-α-RUSH underwent rapid exchange between the ER and ERESs, consistent with the continuity of the ER and ERES membrane revealed by FIB-SEM.
Previous work has shown a requirement for cholesterol in ER-to-Golgi trafficking ( Ridsdale et al., 2006 61. Ridsdale, A. ∙ Denis, M. ∙ Gougeon, P.Y. ... Cholesterol is required for efficient endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport of secretory membrane proteins Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17 :1593-1605 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting this requirement, we found that ERESs labeled with TNF-α-RUSH cargo had higher cholesterol levels compared to levels in the ER based on TopFluor-cholesterol imaging ( Figure 1 I). The cholesterol enrichment at ERESs could help sort certain cargo proteins at these sites, as cholesterol can partition lipids and proteins into subdomains within a continuous bilayer ( Lingwood and Simons, 2010 40. Lingwood, D. ∙ Simons, K. Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle Science. 2010; 327 :46-50 Crossref Scopus (3482) PubMed Google Scholar ; Simunovic et al., 2019 74. Simunovic, M. ∙ Evergren, E. ∙ Callan-Jones, A. ... Curving Cells Inside and Out: Roles of BAR Domain Proteins in Membrane Shaping and Its Cellular Implications Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2019; 35 :111-129 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains to be determined, however, whether ERESs are always cholesterol-enriched environments or only after they have accumulated specific secretory cargo types.
We next explored whether cargo accumulation changes the organization of ERESs. We examined ERESs by cryo-SIM/FIB-SEM during synchronized TNF-α-RUSH cargo release. First, the chronological events of TNF-α-RUSH release were characterized to determine the optimal time for cyro-fixation. Approximately 2–3 min after the addition of biotin, cells entered a synchronized release phase for 10–15 min, in which TNF-α-RUSH in the ER and ERESs underwent anterograde movement. As TNF-α-RUSH left ERESs via mobile, elongated transport intermediates ( Figure S2 A; Video S2 ), a sudden decrease in the intensity of TNF-α-RUSH at ERESs was observed ( Figure S2 B). After 12–18 min of biotin addition, TNF-α-RUSH could be seen accumulating in the Golgi ( Figure S2 C). Thus, we high-pressure-froze cells after 8 min of biotin addition to ensure that significant TNF-α-RUSH would still be at ERESs.

TNF-α-RUSH release after biotin addition in HeLa cells shown by confocal microscopy, related to Figure 2
Cryo-SIM/FIB-SEM imaging revealed TNF-α-RUSH fluorescence localized to an intertwined tubule network connected by a neck to the ER ( Figures 2 A–2Av; Video S3 ), suggesting that these structures are the functional unit of protein exit from the ER. In addition, we saw no enrichment of vesicles near the TNF-α-RUSH-positive ERESs relative to random volumes in the cytoplasm ( Figure S2 D), suggesting that vesicles were not the primary transport vessels. Notably, segmentation and 3D rendering showed that the general organization of ERES during TNF-α-RUSH release remained similar to that in resting cells ( Figures 2 A and 2B). This suggested that sudden cargo accumulation did not fundamentally alter the organization of ERESs. However, the diameter of the entire ERES during TNF-α-RUSH release increased over 2-fold ( Figures 2 B and 2C). This coincided with enlargement of tubules within the network and connecting neck ( Figures 2 B and 2C). The diameters of the nearby ER, by contrast, remained unchanged ( Figure 2 C). Altogether, these results indicated that the size of the ERES and its associated tubules undergo dynamic regulation to accommodate a large quantity of membrane proteins into the secretory pathway, with no fundamental change in ERES organization.

To better understand how such a distinctive organization of ERESs contributes to protein trafficking, we examined the kinetics of cargo entrance into and departure from ERESs using different RUSH cargos. We focused first on TNF-α-RUSH. Despite its pre-localization to ERESs, TNF-α-RUSH remained stationary at ERESs for 2–3 min after biotin addition without any anterograde movement and then moved robustly toward the Golgi, as indicated in the temporal projection map ( Figure 2 D; Video S2 ). This suggested that the ERES entrance and departure of TNF-α-RUSH are differentially regulated.
We next examined other RUSH cargos, including glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored RUSH (GPI-RUSH), transferrin receptor (TfR)-RUSH (transmembrane cargo), and Gp135-RUSH (transmembrane cargo). Unlike TNF-α-RUSH, these RUSH cargos localized primarily in the ER before biotin addition ( Figures 2 E and S2 E). After 2–3 min of biotin incubation, GPI-RUSH accumulated at ERESs, as reflected by an increase in intensity ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Each cargo type entered and accumulated at ERESs at distinct rates ( Figure 2 G). This suggested a specific gating mechanism for cargo entrance into ERESs, which may involve the differential affinity of cargo for COPII, cargo receptors, and/or the ERES’s potentially cholesterol-rich membranes.
Once within an ERES, GPI-RUSH, TfR-RUSH, and Gp135-RUSH all displayed another stationary phase, ranging from 45 s to a few minutes, depending on cargo type ( Figure 2 H), before their movement toward the Golgi. This suggested that cargo departure is also differentially controlled, but through a different mechanism than that for cargo entry into ERESs. Altogether, these results suggest the ERES is a distinct early secretory compartment, with different gatekeeping mechanisms for regulating protein entry and departure.
To explore COPII’s potential gating function at ERESs, we focused on Sar1, a small GTPase responsible for assembling the COPII coat on membranes ( Peotter et al., 2019 54. Peotter, J. ∙ Kasberg, W. ∙ Pustova, I. ... COPII-mediated trafficking at the ER/ERGIC interface Traffic. 2019; 20 :491-503 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used H89, a kinase inhibitor known to inhibit Sar1 recruitment to the ER ( Aridor and Balch, 2000 4. Aridor, M. ∙ Balch, W.E. Kinase signaling initiates coat complex II (COPII) recruitment and export from the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :35673-35676 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee and Linstedt, 2000 38. Lee, T.H. ∙ Linstedt, A.D. Potential role for protein kinases in regulation of bidirectional endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport revealed by protein kinase inhibitor H89 Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 :2577-2590 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), to disrupt COPII assembly. Adding H89 to cells caused a rapid and sustained decrease in the intensity of Sec23 puncta, especially at the cell periphery, without noticeable changes in the ER and Golgi structure over the time period of imaging ( Figures S3 A and S3B). H89 treatment also led to a substantial reduction of TNF-α-RUSH intensity at ERESs ( Figures 3 A and 3B), suggesting that COPII assembly by Sar1-GTP is necessary for TNF-α-RUSH’s entrance into ERESs. In addition, the presence of H89 prevented GPI-RUSH from entering and accumulating at ERESs after biotin addition ( Figures S3 C and S3D), supporting the idea that cargo entry into ERESs requires COPII assembly ( Peotter et al., 2019 54. Peotter, J. ∙ Kasberg, W. ∙ Pustova, I. ... COPII-mediated trafficking at the ER/ERGIC interface Traffic. 2019; 20 :491-503 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Because H89 treatment caused a substantial decrease, but not complete disappearance, of Sec23 puncta, we could identify Sec23 fluorescence in cryo-SIM to analyze their architecture by FIB-SEM under this condition ( Figure 3 C). Examining 200 Sec23-containing puncta in HeLa cells frozen at 9 min of H89 incubation, we found that 42% still had identifiable ERES architectures ( Figures 3 D and S3 F). However, the overall size of these ERESs was significantly smaller with fewer tubule elements; additionally, the necks connecting these ERESs to ER were wider than that seen in control cells ( Figures 3 D–3F). Interestingly, the other 58% of Sec23 remnants under H89 treatment lacked any ERES architecture and instead displayed Sec23 within lysosome-like structures ( Figures S3 E and S3F). This suggested that ERESs are targeted to lysosomes when COPII assembly is perturbed by H89. We further found that RUSH cargos were retained in the ER without the presence of cargo movement to Golgi over 10 min of biotin release in nearly all H89-treated cells ( Figures 3 G and S3 G). Together, these findings support a significant role for COPII activity in the formation and function of ERESs.
We used a GTP-locked Sar1 mutant, Sar1-H79G, to further examine the role of COPII in RUSH cargo release. Previous studies using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) have shown that Sec23 can no longer exchange on and off membranes in cells expressing Sar1-H79G, with the mutation effectively locking COPII on membranes ( Forster et al., 2006 17. Forster, R. ∙ Weiss, M. ∙ Zimmermann, T. ... Secretory cargo regulates the turnover of COPII subunits at single ER exit sites Curr. Biol. 2006; 16 :173-179 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ward et al., 2001 80. Ward, T.H. ∙ Polishchuk, R.S. ∙ Caplan, S. ... Maintenance of Golgi structure and function depends on the integrity of ER export J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155 :557-570 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found fewer yet larger Sec23 puncta in cells expressing Sar1-H79G ( Figures S3 H and S3I). Importantly, these structures no longer functioned as proper ERESs: GPI-RUSH cargo failed to efficiently enter these ERESs after biotin addition ( Figure S3 J), and no cell with Sar1-H79G overexpression was capable of releasing TNF-α- and GPI-RUSH into the secretory pathway for Golgi delivery ( Figure 3 H). While TNF-α-RUSH remained pre-localized to these sites in resting Sar1-H79G-expressing cells, the protein could no longer circulate between the ER and ERESs based on FRAP analysis ( Figures 3 I and 3J). These results suggest that the Sar1-dependent cycle of assembly/disassembly of COPII subunits is required for ER-ERES continuity and cargo sorting in ERESs.
We simultaneously imaged COPII and RUSH cargo during biotin release to examine their distribution relative to each other. Notably, both the inner Sec23 cargo adaptor subunit and outer Sec31 subunit of the COPII coat remained stationary, while transport intermediates carrying TNF-α-RUSH departed from ERESs ( Figures 3 K and S3 K). Temporal projections of COPII and cargo at ERESs show that, after biotin addition, the RUSH cargos, including TNF-α, GPI, Gp135, vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG), and TfR, all exhibited directed motion from peripheral ERESs to the perinuclear Golgi region ( Figures 3 L and S3 L). By contrast, Sec23 or Sec31 remained localized at ERESs and exhibited little movement over this period. This led us to conclude that COPII’s primary role is to gate protein entry into ERESs, a function crucial to both the formation and maintenance of these structures.
Previous work has shown that COPI associates with ERESs and participates in protein departure from these sites ( Scales et al., 1997 66. Scales, S.J. ∙ Pepperkok, R. ∙ Kreis, T.E. Visualization of ER-to-Golgi transport in living cells reveals a sequential mode of action for COPII and COPI Cell. 1997; 90 :1137-1148 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stephens and Pepperkok, 2002 75. Stephens, D.J. ∙ Pepperkok, R. Imaging of procollagen transport reveals COPI-dependent cargo sorting during ER-to-Golgi transport in mammalian cells J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 :1149-1160 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). With these studies in mind, we investigated COPI’s localization with respect to ERESs with Airyscan microscopy, providing a 1.4-fold increase in lateral resolution over conventional confocal imaging ( Huff, 2015 31. Huff, J. The Airyscan detector from ZEISS: confocal imaging with improved signal-to-noise ratio and super-resolution Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 i–ii Crossref Google Scholar ). Antibodies to the endogenous COPI subunit, βCOP, revealed COPI localized both to the Golgi and at peripheral ERESs labeled with Sec23 ( Figure 4 A). In the LdlF-CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell line stably expressing εCOP-YFP (εCOP-CHO) ( Presley et al., 2002 57. Presley, J.F. ∙ Ward, T.H. ∙ Pfeifer, A.C. ... Dissection of COPI and Arf1 dynamics in vivo and role in Golgi membrane transport Nature. 2002; 417 :187-193 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ), εCOP-YFP also co-localized with peripheral ERESs labeled by Sec23 or Sec31 ( Figures 4 B and S4 A), with approximately 70% of the peripheral ERESs decorated with COPI ( Figure 4 C). This percentage was slightly upregulated in cells incubated at 15°C for 2 h to buildup secretory cargo at ERESs ( Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984 64. Saraste, J. ∙ Kuismanen, E. Pre- and post-Golgi vacuoles operate in the transport of Semliki Forest virus membrane glycoproteins to the cell surface Cell. 1984; 38 :535-549 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ) and during GPI-RUSH and TNF-α-RUSH release ( Figures 4 C, 4D, and S4 B). This suggested that, when cargo accumulates in ERESs, more COPI associates with these sites.
After centroid fitting of COPII and COPI on ERESs, we found that they were separated by 140 ± 40 nm, with COPII closer to the ER and COPI further away based on ER labeling by Sec61 ( Figures 4 E and 4G). During RUSH cargo release, GPI-RUSH or TNF-α-RUSH appeared to occupy the space between Sec23 and βCOP at ERESs ( Figures S4 C and S4D) with similar ER-COPII-COPI orientation ( Figures 4 F and 4G). The results thus suggested that, while COPII localizes to ERES zones proximal to ER, COPI distributes to zones distal to ER, with secretory cargo enriched between the two.
We examined whether Sar1-dependent COPII activity is required for COPI’s recruitment to ERESs using H89. We observed that colocalization of COPII and COPI was substantially abolished after H89 treatment in εCOP-CHO cells ( Figure 4 H), with both Sec23 and εCOP puncta diminishing and their localizations becoming dispersed within the cytoplasm. We further found that Sar1-H79G overexpression led to the dissociation of βCOP and εCOP from ERESs ( Figures 4 I, 4J, and S4 E). The results thus suggest that COPI localization at ERESs occurs downstream of Sar1-GTPase activity, raising the possibility that COPII and COPI function sequentially at ERESs to support protein trafficking.
Previous work has revealed that COPI accompanies temperature-sensitive VSVG-containing transport intermediates moving from the ER to Golgi ( Shima et al., 1999 71. Shima, D.T. ∙ Scales, S.J. ∙ Kreis, T.E. ... Segregation of COPI-rich and anterograde-cargo-rich domains in endoplasmic-reticulum-to-Golgi transport complexes Curr. Biol. 1999; 9 :821-824 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stephens et al., 2000 76. Stephens, D.J. ∙ Lin-Marq, N. ∙ Pagano, A. ... COPI-coated ER-to-Golgi transport complexes segregate from COPII in close proximity to ER exit sites J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 :2177-2185 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine COPI’s behavior during the departure of other cargos from ERESs, we monitored εCOP dynamics during synchronized release of different RUSH cargos. Examining TNF-α-RUSH first, we found that εCOP traveled with TNF-α-RUSH-containing transport intermediates as they moved away from ERESs upon biotin addition to cells ( Figure 5 A; Video S4 ). In whole-cell temporal projection traces, εCOP labeled RUSH cargo transport intermediates of TNF-α, GPI, Gp135, VSVG, and TfR, as they moved long distances, anterograde toward the Golgi ( Figure 5 B). Comparable εCOP trajectories could also be seen in εCOP-CHO cells without overexpression of RUSH cargo, suggesting that endogenous transport intermediates are labeled with εCOP ( Figure S5 A). Thus, COPI associates with diversely labeled anterograde transport intermediates from ERESs as they translocate toward the Golgi.
To gain insight into the effect of COPI on ERESs and their derived transport intermediates, we examined ERESs in cells treated with BFA, a drug that inactivates Arf1 GTPase and thereby interferes with COPI membrane association and activities ( Jackson and Casanova, 2000 32. Jackson, C.L. ∙ Casanova, J.E. Turning on ARF: the Sec7 family of guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10 :60-67 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ; Klausner et al., 1992 35. Klausner, R.D. ∙ Donaldson, J.G. ∙ Lippincott-Schwartz, J. Brefeldin A: insights into the control of membrane traffic and organelle structure J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116 :1071-1080 Crossref Scopus (1552) PubMed Google Scholar ). BFA treatment did not alter Sec23 localization at ERESs, despite causing: release of εCOP from these sites ( Figure S5 B); ER retention of both endogenous cargos ( Klausner et al., 1992 35. Klausner, R.D. ∙ Donaldson, J.G. ∙ Lippincott-Schwartz, J. Brefeldin A: insights into the control of membrane traffic and organelle structure J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116 :1071-1080 Crossref Scopus (1552) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ward et al., 2001 80. Ward, T.H. ∙ Polishchuk, R.S. ∙ Caplan, S. ... Maintenance of Golgi structure and function depends on the integrity of ER export J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155 :557-570 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RUSH cargos after biotin incubation ( Figure S5 C); and the loss of ER-to-Golgi transport intermediates ( Altan-Bonnet et al., 2004 1. Altan-Bonnet, N. ∙ Sougrat, R. ∙ Lippincott-Schwartz, J. Molecular basis for Golgi maintenance and biogenesis Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16 :364-372 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, TNF-α-RUSH still circulated between the ER and ERESs in BFA-treated cells, as evidenced by its rapid recovery after photobleaching in ERESs ( Figures 5 C and 5D). ERESs thus persist during BFA treatment, but they are unable to generate transport intermediates targeted to the Golgi.
To analyze the ultrastructure of ERESs in a BFA-treated cell, we applied whole-cell cryo-SIM/FIB-SEM to mEmerald-Sec23-expressing cells frozen 6 min after BFA treatment. This time period was sufficient for BFA to dissemble COPI and early enough to avoid indirect structural changes of ERESs due to prolonged BFA treatment. Sec23-positive ERESs were identified throughout the 3D volume of the cell ( Figure 5 E; Video S5 ). Segmentation and volumetric rendering of these Sec23-positive ERESs revealed an interwoven tubule network connected to the ER ( Figure 5 F), similar to the general organization of ERESs in control cells. However, the overall diameter of the BFA-exposed ERESs was larger than in control cells, and the sizes of tubules in its tubule network were substantially enlarged while the neck was more constricted ( Figures 5 G and 5H).

Together, these results suggested that ERESs can still form and concentrate some cargos (i.e., TNF-α-RUSH) after BFA treatment, but these structures cannot sufficiently mature to bud off anterograde transport intermediates. Given that COPI normally localizes to ERESs and travels with transport intermediates to the Golgi, the results implicated COPI and other Arf1 effectors in the differentiation of transport intermediates derived from ERESs.
We next examined the ultrastructure of transport intermediates using cryo-SIM/FIB-SEM in TNF-α-RUSH-expressing cells frozen at 8 min of biotin release. Positive with TNF-α-RUSH fluorescence, the tubular transport intermediates extended many microns through the cytoplasm ( Figure 6 A). Remarkably, the tubules exhibited a pearled membrane shape, with repeated varicosities ( Figures 6 B and S6 B; Video S6 ). TNF-α-RUSH fluorescence could be seen filling these varicosities ( Figures 6 B and S6 C). The pearled tubule vessels were often immediately adjacent, or still connected, to an ERES ( Figures 6 Bc and 6Bd, green), and microtubules regularly ran parallel to them ( Figure 6 Bd, gray).

As can be seen from the showcased volume renderings in Figures 6 C, S6 B, and S6C, the TNF-α-RUSH-positive tubule transport intermediates displayed variations in length (2.4 ± 0.8 μm, n = 10) and shape, as well as in diameter (50 ± 20 nm; n = 89 pearls), periodicity (200 ± 10 nm; n = 89 pearls), and number of varicosities/pearls (9 ± 5; n = 10) ( Figures 6 D–6H; Video S6 ). Furthermore, these intermediates were not an artifact of RUSH-cargo overexpression, as they could also be found in non-transfected cells ( Figure 6 I), displaying the same characteristics as their RUSH-cargo bearing counterpart, including close proximity to an ERES, a pearled-membrane shape, and close association with microtubules. These results suggested that the pearled transport intermediates may be a common, but not exclusive, vessel for delivery of secretory proteins to the Golgi.
The pearled membrane morphology of these transport intermediates is a characteristic of tubules under tension in model membrane systems ( Bar-Ziv and Moses, 1994 8. Bar-Ziv, R. ∙ Moses, E. Instability and “pearling” states produced in tubular membranes by competition of curvature and tension Phys. Rev. Lett. 1994; 73 :1392-1395 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). This tension may be generated by microtubule-associated motors pulling on these transport intermediates. In fact, the dynactin motor complex has been shown to associate with ERESs through its interactions with COPII ( Watson et al., 2005 81. Watson, P. ∙ Forster, R. ∙ Palmer, K.J. ... Coupling of ER exit to microtubules through direct interaction of COPII with dynactin Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7 :48-55 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ) and to mediate plus-to-minus end movement of transport intermediates containing temperature-sensitive VSVG along microtubules ( Presley et al., 1997 56. Presley, J.F. ∙ Cole, N.B. ∙ Schroer, T.A. ... ER-to-Golgi transport visualized in living cells Nature. 1997; 389 :81-85 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with these previous studies, we found that endogenous p150 Glued , a subunit of the dynactin motor complex visualized by immunostaining, displayed recurrent association with elongated transport intermediates containing TNF-α-, GPI-, Gp135-, TfR-, or VSVG-RUSH cargos ( Figures 6 J and S6 D). These observations support the idea that the pearled transport intermediate is under tension created by the dynactin motor complex.
Previous work has suggested the existence of an ER-Golgi intermediate compartment enriched in p58 that buds off vesicles for protein delivery to the Golgi ( Peotter et al., 2019 54. Peotter, J. ∙ Kasberg, W. ∙ Pustova, I. ... COPII-mediated trafficking at the ER/ERGIC interface Traffic. 2019; 20 :491-503 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schweizer et al., 1988 67. Schweizer, A. ∙ Fransen, J.A. ∙ Bächi, T. ... Identification, by a monoclonal antibody, of a 53-kD protein associated with a tubulo-vesicular compartment at the cis-side of the Golgi apparatus J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107 :1643-1653 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). To clarify the relationship between this purported intermediate compartment and the tubule transport carriers described earlier, we turned to live-cell imaging of RUSH-cargo, COPI, and p58 to obtain a dynamic picture of the system.
We found that fluorescent-protein-tagged p58 was concentrated at ERESs and in elongated tubular structures often linked to ERESs, coinciding with moderate ER and Golgi localization in resting cells ( Figure S7 A). In addition, an offset of 60 ± 30 nm (n = 25, 2 cells) between p58 and Sec23 in the same ERES was observed using Airyscan microscopy ( Figures S7 B and S7C). This offset is similar to the distance of secretory cargos to Sec23 ( Figures S4 D and S4E), suggesting that p58 localizes with these cargos in the mid-region of ERESs.
Significantly, time-lapse imaging revealed that p58-positive tubules were dynamic rather than stationary structures ( Video S7 ). In addition, p150 Glued was often associated with p58-positive tubules ( Figure S7 D), reminiscent of transport intermediates for RUSH cargos. Indeed, p58 decorated and moved concurrently with transport intermediates containing RUSH cargos during biotin release ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Moreover, in the presence of TNF-α-RUSH, the transport intermediates differentiated into cholesterol-rich compartments ( Figure 7 C). These results suggested that, rather than being a stable compartment between ER and Golgi, p58-positive structures are motile transport intermediates, delivering cargo from ERESs to the Golgi. Consistent with this idea, overexpression of Sar1-H79G, which blocks the departure of RUSH cargo from the ER during biotin release, led to ER retention of p58 with no presence in mobile tubules ( Figure 7 D). This also coincided with ER retention of Golgi enzymes ( Figures S7 E and S7F).

Dynamic distribution of p58 in a live HeLa cell monitored by confocal microscopy, related to Figure 7
We next examined the distribution of COPI coats on transport intermediates containing RUSH cargos and p58. Significantly, εCOP was localized to discrete foci on these transport intermediates ( Figures 7 E, 7F, and S7 G). The number of εCOP microdomains appeared to be positively correlated with the length of the tubule transport vessel ( Figure 7 G). While εCOP mostly decorated the tips of these vessels ( Figures 7 E and S7 G), longer transport intermediates often displayed additional εCOP puncta in their middle regions ( Figure 7 F). Similar distributions of COPI on transport intermediates were observed by βCOP immunostaining in cells fixed during RUSH cargo release ( Figure S7 H). This discrete distribution of COPI was not an artifact of RUSH cargo overexpression, as εCOP and βCOP foci were also observed on p58-positive tubes in non-RUSH-cargo-transfected cells ( Figures 7 H and S7 H). Moreover, εCOP moved simultaneously with p58 tubules ( Figures 7 H and 7I), likely carrying endogenous protein cargos from the ER to Golgi. The βCOP microdomains on RUSH-cargo-containing or p58-positive transport intermediates did not colocalize with p150 Glued foci, although they were occasionally nearby ( Figure S7 H), suggesting that COPI components are not directly involved in coupling transport intermediates to microtubules.

Section: Discussion

A key issue in understanding the early secretory pathway and its remarkable adaptability to different cellular states has been how to bridge structural insights from in vitro reconstitution ( Faini et al., 2013 16.

Our re-examination of the architecture and dynamics of the early secretory pathway using whole-cell FIB-SEM technology ( Hoffman et al., 2020 29. Hoffman, D.P. ∙ Shtengel, G. ∙ Xu, C.S. ...

Xu, C.S. ∙ Pang, S. ∙ Shtengel, G. ... Isotropic 3D electron microscopy reference library of whole cells and tissues bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) in combination with multi-modality light microscopy enhances this understanding and, at the same time, significantly transforms it. We showed that, rather than being composed of vesicle-like clusters budded out from nearby ER membranes, as previously suggested ( Aridor, 2018 3. Aridor, M. COPII gets in shape: Lessons derived from morphological aspects of early secretion Traffic. 2018; 19 :823-839 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bannykh et al., 1996 7.

Ultrastructural characterization of endoplasmic reticulum--Golgi transport containers (EGTC) J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 :4263-4273 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), ERESs are intertwined tubules still in continuity with the ER by a narrow neck ( Figure 7 J). This entangled, tubular structure has a diameter of ∼350–390 nm, with COPII distributed closer to the neck and COPI nearer to its rims. When secretory cargo was released into ERESs as a bolus, tubules within the meshwork increased in diameter, and the overall ERES size enlarged. Transport intermediates originating at ERESs were associated with microtubules and appeared as long pearled tubules carrying COPI, but not COPII, on their surface ( Figure 7 J). The earlier serial section TEM approaches, with 10 times less z resolution and a small sampling volume, may have mis-interpreted intertwined tubules as vesicles and missed elongated tubule transport intermediates extending many microns through the cytoplasm.
We envision that, rather than budding off small COPII vesicles, as occurs in in vitro systems, the flexible COPII coat remains associated at the neck region of ERESs through a continuous assembly/disassembly cycle controlled by Sar1-GTPase ( Long et al., 2010 42. Long, K.R. ∙ Yamamoto, Y. ∙ Baker, A.L. ... Sar1 assembly regulates membrane constriction and ER export J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190 :115-128 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see speculative model in Figure 7 J). This cycle would create high membrane curvature for stabilization of a narrow neck ( Hanna et al., 2016 26. Hanna, 4th, M.G. ∙ Mela, I. ∙ Wang, L. ...

Modulation of membrane rigidity by the human vesicle trafficking proteins Sar1A and Sar1B Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 426 :585-589 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Steric hindrance by large proteins such as Tango1L ( Saito et al., 2009 63. Saito, K. ∙ Chen, M. ∙ Bard, F. ... TANGO1 facilitates cargo loading at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites Cell. 2009; 136 :891-902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), which assembles into ring structures at the base of budding ER membranes ( Raote et al., 2018 60. Raote, I. ∙ Ortega-Bellido, M. ∙ Santos, A.J. ... TANGO1 builds a machine for collagen export by recruiting and spatially organizing COPII, tethers and membranes eLife. 2018; 7 :e32723 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), could further stabilize the neck by preventing scission ( Raote and Malhotra, 2021 59. Raote, I. ∙ Malhotra, V. Tunnels for Protein Export from the Endoplasmic Reticulum Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2021; Published online January 27, 2021 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Membrane proteins recruited by COPII could then move into and through this neck, producing a bulging, budding domain that develops into an entangled tubule network ( Bacia et al., 2011 6. Bacia, K. ∙ Futai, E. ∙ Prinz, S. ... Multibudded tubules formed by COPII on artificial liposomes Sci. Rep. 2011; 1 :17 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting this, when COPII was dissociated from ERESs under H89 treatment, cargo proteins at ERESs quickly returned to ER. Airyscan localization analysis further revealed COPII to be more closely positioned to the ER, shown also in previous EM studies ( Bannykh et al., 1996 7. Bannykh, S.I. ∙ Rowe, T. ∙ Balch, W.E.

Cell. 2003; 5 :583-594 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ).
How could newly synthesized cargo proteins sort and concentrate at ERESs if these structures are still connected to the ER by a neck? An important implication of ERESs being a cholesterol-rich environment is that it would create a membrane domain that can dynamically retain membrane proteins and lipids by a partitioning mechanism ( Baumgart et al., 2007 10. Baumgart, T. ∙ Hammond, A.T. ∙ Sengupta, P. ... Large-scale fluid/fluid phase separation of proteins and lipids in giant plasma membrane vesicles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :3165-3170 Crossref Scopus (658) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sengupta et al., 2019 68. Sengupta, P. ∙ Seo, A.Y. ∙ Pasolli, H.A. ... A lipid-based partitioning mechanism for selective incorporation of proteins into membranes of HIV particles Nat.

Struct. 2004; 33 :269-295 Crossref Scopus (1412) PubMed Google Scholar ), thereby helping to sort and concentrate cargos into ERESs. Whether cargo receptors, such as Surf4 ( Mitrovic et al., 2008 47. Mitrovic, S. ∙ Ben-Tekaya, H. ∙ Koegler, E. ... The cargo receptors Surf4, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53, and p25 are required to maintain the architecture of ERGIC and Golgi Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19 :1976-1990 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), contribute to cargo entrance and enrichment of cholesterol at ERESs requires further investigation. This may provide insights into how this continuous membrane system can be tailored for different cargos.
Our data, in agreement with others, showed that COPII remains on ERESs and does not move forward with Golgi-bound transport intermediates ( Shomron et al., 2019 72.

Vesicular and uncoated Rab1-dependent cargo carriers facilitate ER to Golgi transport J. Cell Sci. 2020; 133 :jcs239814 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that COPII does not directly control cargo exit from ERESs. We envision this role to be played by COPI and other Arf1 effectors ( García et al., 2011 20. García, I.A. ∙ Martinez, H.E. ∙ Alvarez, C.

Rab1 and Ca2+ are required for the fusion of carrier vesicles mediating endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125 :239-252 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). This could be achieved if COPI and other Arf1 effectors on ERESs serve to differentiate these sites through recruitment, retention, and recycling of various proteins ( Altan-Bonnet et al., 2004 1.

Biol. 1999; 9 :821-824 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). This activity would likely take place in the middle to peripheral zones of ERESs, where COPI, cargos, and p58 were all localized. The COPI puncta observed at the tips or mid-sections of the tubule carriers could represent domains for further protein cargo sorting or retrieval back to the ER.
In summary, the ultrastructural and dynamic details of ERESs that we observed supports a model for protein trafficking fidelity at ERESs achieved by sequential actions of COPII and COPI within a continuous membrane system. This model of ERES functioning allows secretory transport to be tailored for cargos with various sizes, different cargo loads, or nonselective bulk flow of luminal proteins. This framework may also explain how large cargo such as procollagen exits the ER, as supported by a recent study demonstrating that procollagen travels coincidently with p58 ( Omari et al., 2020 51. Omari, S. ∙ Makareeva, E. ∙ Gorrell, L. ... Mechanisms of procollagen and HSP47 sorting during ER-to-Golgi trafficking Matrix Biol. 2020; 93 :79-94 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). The different rates of cargo entry into and exit from ERESs that we observed could be explained by differential affinity of cargo for COPII or cargo receptors and/or the attraction of cargo to the ERES’s apparent cholesterol-rich, lipid environment. Previous work has shown that spatial segregation of proteins and lipids can occur in continuous bilayer systems from membrane curvature and lipid partitioning effects ( King et al., 2020 34.

Whether a similar mechanism is used in yeast and plants, where COPII vesicles seem to be the primary vessels for protein trafficking ( Donohoe et al., 2013 15. Donohoe, B.S. ∙ Kang, B.H. ∙ Gerl, M.J. ...

If correct, our model would help explain the adaptability of secretory trafficking in healthy and diseased states, including the ERESs’ dynamic control over multiple functions involved in the quality control of protein sorting ( Ge et al., 2017 21.

The proposed model is primarily based on our FIB-SEM and light microscopy data in model cell lines with overexpressing coat proteins and/or cargos, so additional work using secretory components at their endogenous and physiological levels will be needed to verify its conclusions and predictions. Other work needed to extend the conclusions of this study includes examining ERESs and transport intermediates by FIB-SEM technology within cells in tissues rather than in dishes. This will allow assessment of the model in diverse cell types that exhibit large differences in cargo identities, abundances, and sizes. Other open questions that this study has not fully addressed and that remain to be investigated are: the mechanism(s) behind the formation of ERESs and transport intermediates; how receptor-cargo complexes shuttle through COPII and COPI gates to depart from ERESs; and how ERESs adapt their size to accommodate large cargos, such as collagens and lipoproteins.

FIB-SEM dataset generated in this study have been uploaded to https://openorganelle.janelia.org . See below for details.
HeLa, U2OS, and COS-7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HeLa cells were maintained in EMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X penicillin-streptomycin solution. U2OS, COS-7, and εCOP-CHO cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% FBS 1 mM glutamine, and 1X penicillin-streptomycin solution. TransIT-LT1 reagent was used for transfecting HeLa cells, Lipofectamine 3000 for U2OS and COS-7 cells, and Lipofectomine 2000 for εCOP-CHO cells. Transfections were performed according to manufacturers’ instructions for 16-20 hours with the following amount of DNA plasmids (per 0.7-1 cm 2 culture area): 30 ng for SiT-fluorescence protein (FP) and GalT-FP; 50 ng for FP-Sec61β, Sar1-FP, Sar1-H79G-FP, and FP-p58; 75-100 ng for FP-Sec23 and FP-Sec31; 150-200 ng for RUSH plasmids.
mCherry-Sec61β were provided by Molecular Biology Core at Janelia Research Campus. mEmerald-Sec23A, mCherry-Sec23A, and Halo-Sec23A were generated by replacing the YFP portion of YFP-Sec23A (Addgene 66611) ( Stephens et al., 2000 76. Stephens, D.J. ∙ Lin-Marq, N. ∙ Pagano, A. ... COPI-coated ER-to-Golgi transport complexes segregate from COPII in close proximity to ER exit sites J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 :2177-2185 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with mEmerald, mCherry, and Halo, respectively, using AgeI and BsrGI restriction sites. Halo-Sec31 and mEmerald-Sec31 were generated by replacing the CFP portion of CFP-Sec31A (Addgene 66612) ( Stephens et al., 2000 76. Stephens, D.J. ∙ Lin-Marq, N. ∙ Pagano, A. ... COPI-coated ER-to-Golgi transport complexes segregate from COPII in close proximity to ER exit sites J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 :2177-2185 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with Halo and mEmerlad, respectively, using NheI and BsrGI sites. Sar1b-YFP was generated by changing the 39 th amino acid to T in Sar1b-T39N-YFP (Addgene 128155) via site-directed mutagenesis. Sar1-H79G-YFP was then created by mutating H at the 79 th amino acid to T in Sar1b-YFP via site-directed mutagenesis. mApple-tagged Sar1 constructs were generated by replacing the YFP portion of Sar1 constructs with mApple using AgeI and BsrGI sites. Halo-P58 was generated via InFusion cloning kit with a Halo PCR fragment and a P58 backbone PCR fragment. To generated mApple-tagged RUSH constructs, we first created mApple-ΔSbfI-C1 vector to mutate the internal SbfI site in mApple-C1 via site-directed mutagenesis. mApple-RUSH constructs (GPI, TfR, and TNFα) were generated by replacing the EGFP portion of EGFP-GPI-RUSH, EGFP-TfR-RUSH, and EGFP-TNFα-RUSH with a PCR fragment containing mApple-ΔSbfI linked with 5′ SbfI site and 3′ FseI site. Halo-GPI-RUSH, Halo-TfR-RUSH, Halo-VSVG-RUSH, and Halo-TNFα-RUSH were generated the same way using a PCR fragment containing Halo linked with 5′ SbfI site and 3′ FseI site. All oligonucleotides used are listed in Table S2 .
All cells were grown and transfected on Lab-Tek II chambered #1.5 coverglasses or MatTek dishes with #1.5 coverslip. Confocal microscopy was performed on a custom-built Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a YOKOGAWA CSU-X1 Spinning Disk Confocal unit using SR Apo TIRF 100x/1.49 or Plan Apo λ 60x/1.40 objectives. Airyscan imaging were performed using Plan Apo 63x/1.4 objective on ZEISS LSM 880 with Airyscan. Live-cell confocal experiments were conducted with cells incubated in phenol red-free medium at 37°C with 5% CO 2 and humidified air. Photobleaching experiments were performed on the custom-built Nikon microscope equipped with Bruker photoactivation module. HeLa cells co-expressing mEmerald-Sec23 and Halo-TNFα-RUSH stained with JF640 Halo-ligand were subjected to 640 nm laser pulse at maximal intensity in 3.14-μm 2 circular areas to photobleach TNFα-RUSH at ERESs and imaged at 488 nm and 640 nm to monitor the fluorescence recovery. For synchronized cargo release experiments, HeLa or εCOP-CHO cells transfected with RUSH cargo were incubated with biotin at a final concentration of 80 μM.
All procedures were performed at room temperature and all washing steps were done by DPBS for 5 min unless otherwise indicated. For βCOP immunostaining, cells were rinsed with DPBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in DPBS for 20 min. Fixed cells were quenched with 100 mM glycine in DPBS, washed twice, and permeabilized by 0.3% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 20 min. For p150 Glued immunostaining and p150 Glued co-immunostaining with βCOP, cells were fixed with methanol (pre-chilled to −20°C) at −20°C for 5 min. Fixed cells were then washed with DPBS followed by 20 μM digitonin permeabilization in DPBS for 20 min. Permeabilized cells, either by Triton X-100 or digitonin, were then blocked with 5% normal donkey or goat serum in DPBS for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody (anti-βCOP antibody, 1:200 dilution; anti-p150 Glued antibody, 1:500 dilution) in DPBS with 1% BSA at 4°C overnight. After three washes, the samples were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibody (1: 2,000 in dilution) for 1 h. The stained samples were washed for three times and imaged with confocal or Airyscan microscopy at room temperature.
TopFluor-cholesterol was mixed with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) as previously described ( Jansen et al., 2011 33. Jansen, M. ∙ Ohsaki, Y. ∙ Rega, L.R. ... Role of ORPs in sterol transport from plasma membrane to ER and lipid droplets in mammalian cells Traffic. 2011; 12 :218-231 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, TopFluor-cholesterol was dissolved in choloroform:methanol 1:1 (v:v) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in a glass tube. The solution was then dried under a stream of argon gas followed by the addition of 370 mM MβCD in PBS in a 100:1 molar ratio to TopFluor-cholesterol. This mixture was then vortexed, sonicated in water bath for 1-3 min, and incubated at 37°C avoiding light for overnight on a rocker. Undissolved TopFluor-cholesterol was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant containing TopFluor-cholesterol/MβCD mix was aliquoted and stored at −30°C. To monitor subcellular distribution of cholesterol, transfected HeLa cells were incubated with TopFluor-cholesterol/MβCD mix in 1:2,000 dilution for 5 min. Cells were then incubated in label-free media for 30 min to 1 h allowing TopFluor-cholesterol at the PM to be internalized and to reach cholesterol-rich membranes/organelles prior to imaging experiments.
Cryo-SIM, EM sample preparation, and FIB-SEM imaging was performed as previously described ( Hoffman et al., 2020 29. Hoffman, D.P. ∙ Shtengel, G. ∙ Xu, C.S. ... Correlative three-dimensional super-resolution and block-face electron microscopy of whole vitreously frozen cells Science. 2020; 367 :eaaz5357 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2017 83.

Xu, C.S. ∙ Pang, S. ∙ Shtengel, G. ... Isotropic 3D electron microscopy reference library of whole cells and tissues bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). In short, the cells plated on sapphire coverslips were high-pressure frozen and then optically imaged in the custom optical cryostat. SIM images were processed as described ( Gustafsson et al., 2008 25. Gustafsson, M.G. ∙ Shao, L. ∙ Carlton, P.M. ... Three-dimensional resolution doubling in wide-field fluorescence microscopy by structured illumination Biophys. J. 2008; 94 :4957-4970 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following optical imaging, samples were freeze-substituted and resin-embedded. Regions of interested were identified using an XRadia 510 Versa micro X-Ray system (Carl Zeiss X-ray Microscopy Inc.) and then trimmed to expose small (∼100 μm × 100 μm × 60 μm) tabs. FIB-SEM datasets were generated using a Zeiss Capella FIB column fitted onto a Zeiss Merlin SEM for 8 nm isotropic voxels and a Zeiss Gemini500 SEM for 4nm isotropic voxels. The final datasets were registered using a SIFT-based algorithm ( Lowe, 2004 43. Lowe, D.G. Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints Int. J. Comput. Vis. 2004; 60 :91-110 Crossref Scopus (47724) Google Scholar ). To register the FIB-SEM to cryo-SIM we used the software package BigWarp ( Bogovic et al., 2016 12. Bogovic, J.A. ∙ Hanslovsky, P. ∙ Wong, A. ... Robust Registration of Calcium Images by Learned Contrast Synthesis Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging IEEE, 2016; 1123-1126 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7493463 Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar ) and morphological ER landmarks as described ( Hoffman et al., 2020 29. Hoffman, D.P. ∙ Shtengel, G. ∙ Xu, C.S. ... Correlative three-dimensional super-resolution and block-face electron microscopy of whole vitreously frozen cells Science. 2020; 367 :eaaz5357 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). All segmentation was performed using semi-manual thresholding and manual painting tools within Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 3D rendered images and movies were created within Amira. Below is a brief description for each sample including cell type, general sample preparation details, and original publication (where applicable).

All image analyses were performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) unless otherwise indicated. All intensity analyses were subjected to background subtraction. To obtain relative intensity profiles, the intensity values from different conditions were normalized to that at the first time point or in control groups. Diameters of ERES, comprising tubules, ER, ER-ERES necks, and transport intermediates were measured by finding the peak-to-peak distance of line-profile cross-sections from FIB-SEM slices. Distribution of COPI with respect to ERES was quantified by measuring the percentage pixels occupied by both COPI and COPII fluorescence after thresholding. For separation analysis, intensity profiles of corresponding fluorescence puncta were fit to a Gaussian curve to determine its center position. Separation distances are reported relative to the center distance of COPII puncta. Temporal projection maps were generated by Temporal-Color Code from stacks of time-lapse images in ImageJ. COPII, COPI, and RUSH cargo tracking was manually done using Tracking Plugin in ImageJ. To evaluate the % volume occupied by vesicles near and away from ERES, vesicles and cytosol in one cubic micron ROIs were manually segmented. The reported numbers are the ratio of the volume occupied by vesicles versus the total available cytosolic volume.
Data were statistically analyzed by two-tailed t test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software; La Jolla, CA). Data distribution assumed to be normal but not formally tested. ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001; n.s., not significant. Graphs were generated using OriginPro (OriginLab; Northampton, MA) and GraphPad Prism.
