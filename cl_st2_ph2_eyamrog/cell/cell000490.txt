Title: Mechanoreceptor synapses in the brainstem shape the central representation of touch


Abstract: Summary

Mammals use glabrous (hairless) skin of their hands and feet to navigate and manipulate their environment. Cortical maps of the body surface across species contain disproportionately large numbers of neurons dedicated to glabrous skin sensation, in part reflecting a higher density of mechanoreceptors that innervate these skin regions. Here, we find that disproportionate representation of glabrous skin emerges over postnatal development at the first synapse between peripheral mechanoreceptors and their central targets in the brainstem. Mechanoreceptor synapses undergo developmental refinement that depends on proximity of their terminals to glabrous skin, such that those innervating glabrous skin make synaptic connections that expand their central representation. In mice incapable of sensing gentle touch, mechanoreceptors innervating glabrous skin still make more powerful synapses in the brainstem. We propose that the skin region a mechanoreceptor innervates controls the developmental refinement of its central synapses to shape the representation of touch in the brain.

Section: Introduction

Perception relies on populations of sensory neurons that represent salient features of the physical world. Neurons are not uniformly allocated across a sensory space, but rather, particular regions are often represented by disproportionate numbers of neurons. A striking example is the primate visual system, where neurons across the visual hierarchy disproportionately represent central regions of the visual field, in part reflecting the high density of photoreceptors in the center of the primate retina ( Cowey and Rolls, 1974 12. Cowey, A. ∙ Rolls, E.T. Human cortical magnification factor and its relation to visual acuity Exp. Brain Res. 1974; 21 :447-454 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). Disproportionate central representation of foveal visual space has far-reaching consequences, as it shapes the ocular motor strategies used to survey the world as well as cognitive strategies used to comprehend visual scenes ( Yarbus, 1967 48. Yarbus, A.L. Eye movements and vision Plenum Press, 1967 Crossref Google Scholar ). Similarly, the human somatosensory cortex contains an iconic map of the body, the homunculus, that does not faithfully reflect our physical form but rather disproportionately allocates neurons to the hands and face relative to the torso and proximal limbs ( Penfield and Boldrey, 1937 29. Penfield, W. ∙ Boldrey, E. SOMATIC MOTOR AND SENSORY REPRESENTATION IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX OF MAN AS STUDIED BY ELECTRICAL STIMULATION Brain. 1937; 60 :389-443 Crossref Scopus (2947) Google Scholar ). Disproportionate central representation may reflect the tension between completely tiling a sensory space and allocating neural resources to areas where acuity or representational capacity is critical.
A common feature of mammalian cortical body maps is that they favor glabrous (non-hairy) skin surfaces ( Penfield and Boldrey, 1937 29. Penfield, W. ∙ Boldrey, E. SOMATIC MOTOR AND SENSORY REPRESENTATION IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX OF MAN AS STUDIED BY ELECTRICAL STIMULATION Brain. 1937; 60 :389-443 Crossref Scopus (2947) Google Scholar ; Sur et al., 1978 36.

Magnification, receptive-field area, and “hypercolumn” size in areas 3b and 1 of somatosensory cortex in owl monkeys J.

Functional organization of tactile inputs from the hand in the cuneate nucleus and its relationship to organization in the somatosensory cortex J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 411 :369-389 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, glabrous skin representations occupy 30% of primate somatosensory cortex but only 5% of skin surface area ( Sur et al., 1982 38. Sur, M. ∙ Nelson, R.J. ∙ Kaas, J.H. Representations of the body surface in cortical areas 3b and 1 of squirrel monkeys: comparisons with other primates J. Comp. Neurol. 1982; 211 :177-192 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). The distortions to figure of the cortical somatosensory homunculus may reflect differences in the density of mechanoreceptors in skin across the body ( Catani, 2017 5. Catani, M. A little man of some importance Brain. 2017; 140 :3055-3061 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). This view is supported by observations in rodents, where neurons in layer IV of somatosensory cortex that respond to whisker stimulation are organized into barrels, and anatomical measurements revealed that the number of neurons in each barrel is proportionate to the number of myelinated sensory neurons innervating the corresponding whisker ( Lee and Woolsey, 1975 19. Lee, K.J. ∙ Woolsey, T.A. A proportional relationship between peripheral innervation density and cortical neuron number in the somatosensory system of the mouse Brain Res. 1975; 99 :349-353 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ).
However, multiple lines of evidence challenge the conventional view that disproportionate central representation of the body is simply a reflection of skin innervation density. For example, the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the superior colliculus contain body maps with differing proportions ( Dräger and Hubel, 1976 13. Dräger, U.C. ∙ Hubel, D.H. Topography of visual and somatosensory projections to mouse superior colliculus J. Neurophysiol. 1976; 39 :91-101 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the same peripheral inputs can support different central representations. Moreover, a compilation of human anatomical and physiological measurements argues that differences in peripheral sensory neuron numbers may not account for the over-representation of the hands and the digits in somatosensory cortex ( Corniani and Saal, 2020 10. Corniani, G. ∙ Saal, H.P. Tactile innervation densities across the whole body J. Neurophysiol. 2020; 124 :1229-1240 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). This parallels work in the visual system demonstrating that photoreceptor density at the primate retinal fovea is insufficient to explain the enlarged representation of central fields of view in the visual cortex ( Azzopardi and Cowey, 1993 1. Azzopardi, P. ∙ Cowey, A. Preferential representation of the fovea in the primary visual cortex Nature. 1993; 361 :719-721 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, despite the prevalence of disproportionate body maps across mammals with diverse body forms, the mechanisms that shape the representation of the body in the brain have remained incompletely understood since the discovery of these maps nearly a century ago.
Here, we examine body representation in mice and find that disproportionate emphasis of glabrous skin emerges during postnatal development in multiple brain areas, while innervation density remains stable. This shift reflects developmental refinement of synaptic connections in the brainstem and the skin region a mechanoreceptor innervates. Functionally, optical stimulation of glabrous-skin-innervating mechanoreceptors evokes larger synaptic currents and is more effective at driving spiking in brainstem neurons than stimulation of hairy-skin-innervating sensory neurons. Interestingly, this difference is preserved in mice that do not sense gentle touch on their body surface. Together, our findings support a model in which peripheral innervation density and skin-region-dependent synaptic expansion in the brainstem act multiplicatively to shape the central representation of touch.

Section: Results

We investigated the development of glabrous skin representation in mouse S1. Hindlimb and forelimb S1 were identified through retrograde labeling of corticospinal projections to the lumbar and cervical enlargements of the spinal cord ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 ). Stereotactic recordings spanning hindlimb and forelimb S1 were performed with a grid of multielectrode array (MEA) penetrations of S1 in lightly anesthetized mice. Recordings from hindpaw regions of postnatal day 14 (P14) cortex showed an equal number of S1 neurons responding to paw glabrous and paw hairy skin stroke, while forepaw cortex emphasized paw glabrous skin surfaces ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Similar recordings in adult mice uncovered a more pronounced glabrous representation bias, an ∼3-fold increase in the number of neurons that exhibit paw glabrous-to-hairy skin preference across both hindpaw and forepaw S1, compared to P14 animals ( Figures 1 B and 1C). As functional responses in primate S1 depend on Aβ-low threshold mechanoreceptors (Aβ-LTMRs) that ascend the dorsal column of the spinal cord and project directly to the brainstem ( Jain et al., 1997 18. Jain, N. ∙ Catania, K.C. ∙ Kaas, J.H. Deactivation and reactivation of somatosensory cortex after dorsal spinal cord injury Nature. 1997; 386 :495-498 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), we recorded from glabrous- and hairy-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs and confirmed that skin stroke similarly excites both populations ( Figure S1 ). Thus, over-representation of paw glabrous skin relative to paw hairy skin dramatically increases from P14 to adulthood.
In the visual system, the heightened photoreceptor density characteristic of the primate fovea emerges over weeks of postnatal development ( Packer et al., 1990 28. Packer, O. ∙ Hendrickson, A.E. ∙ Curcio, C.A. Development redistribution of photoreceptors across the Macaca nemestrina (pigtail macaque) retina J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 298 :472-493 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), and so we next asked whether a similar developmental rearrangement of peripheral touch neurons accompanies the dramatic developmental shift in paw glabrous skin and hairy skin functional representation observed in S1. We measured the distribution of the terminal endings of Aβ-LTMRs in the skin through retrograde viral transduction of sensory neurons that ascend the dorsal column using the Cre-dependent alkaline phosphatase (AP) reporter mouse Brn3a cKOAP ( Figure 1 D; Badea et al., 2009b 3. Badea, T.C. ∙ Hua, Z.L. ∙ Smallwood, P.M. ... New mouse lines for the analysis of neuronal morphology using CreER(T)/loxP-directed sparse labeling PLoS ONE. 2009; 4 :e7859 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) in P14 and adult (P50) mice. Viral transduction was titrated such that dorsal-column-projecting Aβ-LTMRs were sparsely labeled and the endings of individual neurons in the skin were distinguishable (see STAR Methods ; Figure S1 ); all known Aβ-LTMR subtypes were detected in these experiments ( Wu et al., 2012 46. Wu, H. ∙ Williams, J. ∙ Nathans, J. Morphologic diversity of cutaneous sensory afferents revealed by genetically directed sparse labeling eLife. 2012; 1 :e00181 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bai et al., 2015 4. Bai, L. ∙ Lehnert, B.P. ∙ Liu, J. ... Genetic Identification of an Expansive Mechanoreceptor Sensitive to Skin Stroking Cell. 2015; 163 :1783-1795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are stark differences in the number of Aβ-LTMRs/skin area along the proximal-distal axis of the limbs of adult mice, consistent with previous electrophysiological and anatomical measurements in other species ( Wang et al., 1997 42. Wang, L. ∙ Millecchia, R. ∙ Brown, P.B. Correlation of peripheral innervation density and dorsal horn map scale J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78 :689-702 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 ). Additionally, at both P14 and adulthood, forepaw glabrous skin is approximately three times more densely innervated by Aβ-LTMRs than forepaw hairy skin, consistent with prior functional measurements in mice ( Walcher et al., 2018 41. Walcher, J. ∙ Ojeda-Alonso, J. ∙ Haseleu, J. ... Specialized mechanoreceptor systems in rodent glabrous skin J. Physiol. 2018; 596 :4995-5016 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 D and 1E). In contrast, hindpaw glabrous and hindpaw hairy skin have close to equal innervation densities at these two ages ( Figures 1 D and 1E). For each paw, the ratio of innervation densities is expressed as a glabrous/hairy ratio ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Between P14 and adulthood, we detect no significant changes in glabrous/hairy skin Aβ-LTMR innervation ratios in either the forepaws or the hindpaws ( Figure 1 E). We measured the peripheral arbor morphologies of sparsely labeled neurons in glabrous and hairy skin and found no changes in terminal area between P14 and adulthood ( Figure S1 ).
These functional and anatomical findings define the relationship between paw glabrous and paw hairy skin innervation density and central (S1) representation over development. At P14, paw glabrous skin and hairy skin representation in S1 is proportionate to Aβ-LTMR skin innervation density ( Figure 1 F). In contrast, in adults, there is an ∼3-fold expansion of glabrous skin preferring S1 neurons beyond that predicted by the distribution of Aβ-LTMRs. We also recorded from the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, another brain region that exhibits a prominent representation of the body surface ( Figure 1 F). Inferior collicular representations of glabrous skin in adult mice exceed that predicted by the relative numbers of LTMR endings across hindpaw skin, similar to S1. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the degree of central representation of paw glabrous skin and paw hairy skin surfaces is consistent with receptor density early in postnatal development but that there is a dramatic and unexplained expansion of cortical and collicular neurons responding to touch of glabrous skin in adulthood.
Developmental increases in the number of glabrous skin preferring neurons in cortex (S1) and inferior colliculus could reflect changes at a common anatomical locus earlier in the somatosensory hierarchy. Therefore, we performed dual retrograde labeling experiments targeting the ventroposteriolateral (VPL) thalamus (the main input to somatosensory cortex) and the inferior colliculus to visualize cell bodies of ascending projection neurons of both the gracile nucleus (GN) and cuneate nucleus (CN) of the brainstem dorsal column nuclei, a region that receives direct synaptic input from Aβ-LTMRs. Dual-color retrograde labeling in Gad2 nls-mcherry mice demonstrated the presence of substantial, largely nonoverlapping and intermingled populations of thalamic projection neurons, inferior collicular projection neurons, and presumptive local inhibitory neurons within both the GN and CN ( Figure S2 ).
We developed a preparation for imaging the GN using multiphoton microscopy in mice where GN thalamic projection neurons were retrogradely transduced with the calcium indicator jGCaMP7s ( Figure 2 A). The GN, which encodes mechanosensory inputs from the caudal half of the animal, including the hindlimbs, is optically accessible in acute preparations that expose the brainstem, while the CN is not because it lies beneath ascending fiber tracts. Tactile responses of hundreds of GN neurons at depths up to ∼250 μm and throughout the entirety of the GN were routinely observed for up to 6 h ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
We next asked whether disproportionate representation of glabrous skin is present within the GN and, if so, whether it emerges over postnatal development. Stroke to the ipsilateral hindpaw glabrous skin, hindpaw hairy skin, thigh skin, or back skin of P14 mice (equivalent, ∼10-mm 2 areas) evoked robust responses in GN neurons ( Figure 2 B). Spatial maps of the body revealed a core region of intermingled hindpaw glabrous skin and hairy skin preferring neurons and less numerous populations of thigh and back hairy skin preferring neurons ( Figure 2 D). At P14, GN thalamic projection neurons showed no preference at the population level for touch to glabrous skin compared to hairy skin of the hindpaw ( Figures 2 B and 2D). The same was true for GN inferior collicular projecting neurons, which exhibited no population bias toward glabrous skin at P14 ( Figure 2 E).
In contrast, in adult mice, approximately three times as many GN thalamic projection neurons preferentially responded to glabrous skin stroke as those that preferentially responded to stroke on a comparable surface area on the hairy skin side of the same paw ( Figures 2 F and 2H). GN inferior collicular projecting neurons also showed a marked preference for glabrous skin stimulation ( Figures 2 G and 2H), while glabrous skin representation exceeding skin innervation densities were not observed for locally projecting inhibitory neurons ( Figure 2 H). GN thalamic projection neuron populations had glabrous skin to hairy skin preference ratios that were equivalent to cortical (S1) neuron preference ratios measured at both P14 and adult ( Figure 2 I). Taken together, these findings indicate that disproportionate representation of glabrous skin in both S1 and the inferior colliculus is partially or fully driven by changes in the GN over development.
Disproportionate central representation of glabrous skin might reflect developmental changes in Aβ-LTMR central projections and their synapses onto brainstem neurons. Therefore, we next sparsely labeled Aβ-LTMRs to explore the relationship between the skin type innervated and the branching patterns of their axonal arbors in the GN and CN. The three main classes of cutaneous Aβ-LTMRs were stochastically labeled using the Cre-dependent AP reporter mouse Brn3a cKOAP in conjunction with LTMR-selective CreER lines and low-dose tamoxifen treatments (see STAR Methods ). Samples had one to four labeled LTMRs per animal with central projections terminating in the GN or CN, such that the peripheral arbors of individual LTMRs could be identified in the skin based on established somatotopy. This approach was effective in generating sparsely labeled trunk-level Aβ-LTMRs but more rarely resulted in the labeling of paw-innervating LTMRs, likely because they are fewer in number, as the majority of the mouse’s skin consists of trunk hairy skin. Thus, we generated a dual Cre- and FlpO-recombinase-dependent Tau FsF-iAP reporter mouse to intersectionally label neurons through injection of an AAV2/1-FlpO virus to the skin of animals containing CreER alleles ( Figures 3 A and S3 ).
We reconstructed the entire axonal arbors of each Aβ-LTMR type that innervates paw glabrous skin, paw hairy skin, or trunk hairy skin ( Figures 3 and S3 ). Paw glabrous-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs form elaborate central arbors in the GN or CN that dwarf those formed by trunk-level Aβ-LTMRs and the majority of paw hairy-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs ( Figures 3 B, 3C, and S3 ). Intriguingly, the central arbors of a small number of paw hairy-skin-innervating LTMRs were equally as complex as those of glabrous-skin-innervating LTMRs ( Figures 3 B and 3C). To determine if this variability in paw hairy-skin-innervating LTMR central arbor structure is explained by LTMR subtype or location, we identified the exact position and morphology of each neuron’s peripheral arbor within the paw skin. We detected no relationship between the genetic class of neurons and the properties of their central arbors ( Figure S3 ). Strikingly, hairy-skin-innervating neurons with peripheral arbors located at the border between paw glabrous skin and paw hairy skin (<0.5 mm from the edge of the paw after dissection) form arbors in the GN or CN that are significantly more elaborate than those formed by LTMRs innervating hairy skin >0.5 mm from the edge of the paw ( Figures 3 B, 3C, and S3 ). One such labeled neuron formed peripheral endings that span both hairy and glabrous skin, and this neuron formed a complex central arbor in the brainstem that resembled those of glabrous-skin-innervating neurons ( Figure 3 C, arbor indicated by asterisks). Together, these findings demonstrate that the proximity of an Aβ-LTMR’s peripheral arbor to glabrous skin predicts the complexity of its axonal arbors in the brainstem across multiple genetically and morphologically distinct LTMR subclasses.
We also explored the relationship between Aβ-LTMR skin innervation sites and their histologically defined synapses in the brainstem. Presynaptic terminals of Aβ-LTMRs were labeled with synaptophysin-tdTomato or synaptophysin-mScarlet fusion proteins, hereafter referred to as syn-fluorescent protein (syn-FP), by injecting AAVs into the glabrous or hairy skin of the paw or trunk ( Figure 4 A). We quantified the number of syn-FP + puncta in the GN or CN and the number of labeled LTMR axons entering the brainstem to calculate average synapse numbers per LTMR. In GN and CN sections co-stained with synaptic markers, the majority of syn-FP + puncta were found in apposition to Homer1, a postsynaptic marker for excitatory synapses, and co-localized with vGlut1, a presynaptic marker for Aβ-LTMRs ( Figures 4 A and S4 ). This analysis revealed that individual adult forepaw glabrous-skin-innervating neurons form more synapses in the CN than adult forepaw hairy-skin-innervating neurons ( Figure 4 B). Similarly, adult hindpaw glabrous-skin-innervating neurons form more synapses in the GN than adult neurons innervating back, thigh, and hindpaw hairy skin ( Figure 4 C).
To determine when these synaptic differences in Aβ-LTMR central arbors emerge over development, we injected AAV-syn-FP into hindpaw glabrous skin, hindpaw hairy skin, or thigh hairy skin to label Aβ-LTMRs in P14 animals. At P14, hindlimb hairy-skin- and glabrous-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs form similar numbers of synapses per neuron, in contrast to adult time points ( Figure 4 C). Both hindlimb hairy-skin- and glabrous-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs form more synapses in the GN at P14 than observed in adulthood ( Figure 4 C). However, this difference is more pronounced for hindpaw hairy-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs, which exhibited a ∼75% loss of synapses per neuron between P14 and adulthood. Similarly, we found that P5–P10 hairy-skin-innervating and trunk-level Aβ RA-LTMRs form significantly more complex axonal arbors in the GN or CN than their adult counterparts when quantifying the total number of end points ( Figure S3 ).
We next examined the receptive fields of GN thalamic projection neurons at postnatal and adult time points ( Figure S4 ). We found that these receptive fields decline in size over time, consistent with developmental refinement and possible pruning of synaptic connections. Fewer GN thalamic projection neurons with large, multiregional receptive fields were observed as development progressed ( Figure S4 ). Glabrous expansion could occur through an increase in the number of GN neurons responding to glabrous touch or a depletion of those responding to hairy skin stimulation. We observed a developmental decline in the percentage of the GN thalamic projection neuron population that responded to hairy skin, but not glabrous skin ( Figure S4 ). Anatomically, paw glabrous-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs make more synapses in the brainstem compared to paw or trunk hairy-skin-innervating LTMRs, and these differences emerge over postnatal development ( Figure 4 D). Therefore, disproportionate central representation of glabrous skin could emerge developmentally through skin-region-dependent differences in Aβ-LTMR synaptic refinement ( Figure 4 D).
The functional connectivity of neurons in the visual system has been defined at single-photoreceptor resolution through approaches that relate the history of spiking to a white noise stimulus in a neuron’s receptive field ( Field et al., 2010 14. Field, G.D. ∙ Gauthier, J.L. ∙ Sher, A. ... Functional connectivity in the retina at the resolution of photoreceptors Nature. 2010; 467 :673-677 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). To apply this approach, we expressed the light-gated ion channel ReaChR ( Hooks et al., 2015 16. Hooks, B.M. ∙ Lin, J.Y. ∙ Guo, C. ... Dual-channel circuit mapping reveals sensorimotor convergence in the primary motor cortex J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :4418-4426 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) in peripheral neurons and optically mapped the glabrous and hairy skin receptive fields of GN neurons. Whereas mechanical stimuli that reliably drive spiking inevitably excite many Aβ-LTMRs in the skin, optogenetic approaches have the potential to selectively and reliably excite single LTMRs. We constructed an optomechanical device capable of rapidly and precisely exciting the endings of neurons in the skin of Cdx2-Cre; Avil FlpO ; Rosa26 LsL-FsF-ReaChR mice, which express ReaChR in all sensory neurons innervating hindlimb skin. We inserted MEAs into the L4 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and optically stimulated ReaChR-expressing sensory neuron terminals in the skin with focused pulses of laser light, moving the stimulus to a new random location on the paw every millisecond ( Figure 5 A). We then used reverse correlation analysis to recover a time-varying spatial receptive field for individual units through computation of the spike-triggered average ( Figure 5 B, bottom). The optical receptive fields generated in this manner resemble the mechanosensory terminal fields of individual LTMRs and overlapped with their mechanical receptive fields ( Figure 5 B; n = 11 neurons with targeted mechanical stimulation; data not shown; see STAR Methods ). Importantly, optical stimulation of Aβ-LTMRs in both hairy and glabrous skin typically produced single spikes with equivalent probabilities and latencies ( Figure 5 C; data not shown).
Next, identical optical stimuli were used to excite neurons innervating hindpaw glabrous skin, hindpaw hairy skin, or thigh while recording from the GN of the brainstem using an MEA targeted to the GN ( Figure 5 D). In contrast to the LTMRs recorded in the DRG ( Figures 5 A–5C), GN unit spike-triggered averages demonstrated complex spatiotemporal receptive fields with multiple, discontinuous receptive field “spots” (RF spots) that were reminiscent of individual LTMR spatial receptive fields and staggered with respect to one another in time ( Figures 5 E, S5 C, and S5D). RF spots had similar strength and sizes in control experiments, where only a fraction of Aβ-LTMRs expressed ReaChR, though the number of spatiotemporally isolated RF spots identified were fewer, as expected if each RF spot reflects the contribution of a single LTMR input to a GN neuron’s receptive field ( Figures S5 E and S5F).
Examination of the time-projected spatial receptive fields of optically evoked GN units demonstrated that stimulation of a single RF spot, which likely corresponds to a single Aβ-LTMR input, in glabrous skin is more effective at driving spiking in GN neurons than a similar stimulus applied to a single hairy skin RF spot ( Figure 5 E, F). This effect was consistent across 120 spatiotemporally well-isolated RF spots identified across eight animals ( Figure 5 F). Because the optical stimuli used for these GN maps are equally effective at exciting glabrous skin and hairy skin LTMRs, based on our DRG recordings ( Figure 5 C), this finding indicates that stimulation of individual glabrous-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs more strongly evokes spiking in GN neurons compared to hairy-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMRs.
Our histological synaptic analysis ( Figure 4 ) and optogenetic receptive field measurements ( Figure 5 ) suggest that glabrous-skin-innervating LTMRs make more powerful synaptic connections onto GN neurons. However, the in vivo optogenetic receptive field experiments provide only an indirect measure of synapse strength that lacks cellular specificity. To directly characterize synaptic connections between glabrous skin Aβ-LTMRs or hairy skin Aβ-LTMRs and GN thalamic projection neurons, we made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from GN thalamic projection neurons in acute brainstem slices. The relative strength of glabrous-skin- and hairy-skin-innervating Aβ-LTMR synapses was measured by optogenetically exciting single presynaptic axons in TrkB CreER ; Avil FlpO ; R26 LsL-FsF-ReaChR::mCitrine mice that expressed ReaChR in Aβ RA-LTMRs that innervate glabrous skin, or Ret CreER ; Pvalb FlpO ; R26 LsL-F-ChR2::YFP-F mice that expressed ReaChR in Aβ RA-LTMRs that innervate hairy skin (see STAR Methods ). To measure the total ascending synaptic input and produce corresponding fiber fraction estimates of the convergence of presynaptic inputs onto GN thalamic projection neurons, we also electrically stimulated the dorsal column with a bipolar electrode ( Hooks and Chen, 2006 15. Hooks, B.M. ∙ Chen, C. Distinct roles for spontaneous and visual activity in remodeling of the retinogeniculate synapse Neuron. 2006; 52 :281-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ; Litvina and Chen, 2017 20. Litvina, E.Y. ∙ Chen, C. Functional Convergence at the Retinogeniculate Synapse Neuron. 2017; 96 :330-338.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ).
GN thalamic projection neurons that had been retrogradely labeled from the thalamus with CTB-647 were visually targeted for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings using a horizontal brainstem slice preparation. Minimal optical stimulation of Aβ RA-LTMRs produced short-latency unitary synaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) interspersed with failures ( Figures 6 B and 6E, left panels). EPSC waveforms were stereotyped, and histograms of the evoked synaptic current amplitudes across multiple trials were bimodal, consistent with single-fiber isolation ( Figures 6 B and 6E, right panels). Maximal EPSCs evoked through saturating electrical stimulation of dorsal column axons were of comparable amplitude across recordings from GN thalamic projection neurons postsynaptic to glabrous-skin- and hairy-skin-innervating LTMRs ( Figures 6 C and 6F). Immunohistochemical visualization of genetically labeled LTMRs and filled, recorded GN thalamic projection neurons revealed regions of presynaptic (fluorescent protein and VGlut1 + ) and postsynaptic, dendritic apposition, consistent with a monosynaptic connection ( Figures 6 D and 6G).
These GN whole-cell recordings revealed that glabrous-skin-innervating Aβ RA-LTMR single fiber strengths are two-fold larger than hairy-skin-innervating Aβ RA-LTMR fiber strengths ( Figure 6 H). Moreover, our electrical stimulation findings show that “glabrous skin” and “hairy skin” GN thalamic projection neurons receive comparable total synaptic input ( Figures 6 C and 6F). Skin region specific estimates of the number of presynaptic ascending neurons that converge onto individual GN thalamic projection neurons were computed by dividing the maximal electrically evoked EPSC by the minimal optogenetic single-fiber EPSC ( Figure 6 I). Together, these findings support a model in which glabrous-skin-innervating LTMRs make stronger and less convergent synaptic connections onto GN thalamic projection neurons compared to hairy-skin-innervating LTMRs ( Figure 6 J).
In the visual system, both spontaneous and visually evoked patterns of retinal activity contribute to pruning of retinal ganglion cell synapses in the thalamus during postnatal development ( Hooks and Chen, 2006 15.

To determine if touch-evoked activity in LTMRs shapes the relative strength of Aβ-LTMR synapses in the brainstem, we analyzed conditional knockout animals in which Piezo2, the principal mechano-sensitive ion channel for LTMRs ( Ranade et al., 2014 31. Ranade, S.S. ∙ Woo, S.H. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ... Piezo2 is the major transducer of mechanical forces for touch sensation in mice Nature. 2014; 516 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (595) PubMed Google Scholar ), is deleted using the Cdx2-Cre line, which drives recombination broadly in neurons below cervical level C2, including DRG neurons. Cdx2-Cre; Piezo2 flox/flox and Cdx2-Cre; Piezo2 flox/Null animals display severe coordination deficits, similar to those reported for Hoxb8-Cre; Piezo2 cKO animals ( Woo et al., 2015 45.

We assessed touch sensitivity and optical excitability of Aβ-LTMRs that lack Piezo2 , with the goal of comparing optical receptive fields from different skin regions in GN neurons in brainstem.
In wild-type animals that express ReaChR in all sensory neurons, many of the DRG units that spike in response to optical stimulation of skin also respond to innocuous mechanical brushing, indentation, or pulling of the glabrous skin that mimics gripping forces. This is an underestimate of the extent of mechanosensitivity within the population, as individual receptive fields were not explicitly targeted ( Figure 7 A). In contrast, light touch-evoked responses are nearly absent in Cdx2-Cre; Piezo2 flox/flox ; Avil FlpO ; R26 -FsF-ReaChR animals, while responses to optical stimulation and strong pinch persisted ( Figure 7 B). GN thalamic PNs in Piezo2 conditional mutants showed a similar, nearly complete loss of innocuous touch responses, with no change in the number of neurons responsive to a strong pinch stimulus ( Figure S7 ), excluding the possibility of latent, indirect mechanosensory input from small-caliber LTMRs that might not be easily detected in MEA recordings of DRG neurons. Importantly, the number of DRG sensory neurons responding to skin optical stimulation was equivalent between Piezo2 conditional mutants and control animals ( Figure 7 C).
GN neurons recorded in Cdx2-Cre; Piezo2 flox/flox ; Avil FlpO ; R26 FsF-ReaChR mice that were stimulated with optical stimuli applied to the skin had spatiotemporally well-isolated RF spots with dimensions reminiscent of individual LTMRs (similar to the experiments presented in Figure 5 ). These optically evoked RF spots most likely represent single LTMR inputs to GN neurons ( Figure 7 E). Similar to control animals, we found that stimulation of individual RF spots on glabrous skin more strongly excited GN neurons than comparable stimuli applied to hairy skin in the Piezo2 mutant mice that lack mechanically evoked LTMR activity ( Figures 7 E,and 7F). Together, these findings indicate that the disproportionate strength of glabrous-skin-innervating LTMR synapses in the brainstem can be established independent of mechanically evoked activity in LTMRs.

Section: Discussion

Mammalian nervous systems are embedded in a fascinating diversity of body forms that in turn shape their structure, and nearly half of the mouse brain contains neurons that are organized with respect to the body ( Wang et al., 2020 43. Wang, Q. ∙ Ding, S.L. ∙ Li, Y. ... The Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework: A 3D Reference Atlas Cell. 2020; 181 :936-953.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glabrous-skin-responsive neurons occupy disproportionately large cortical regions in primates, cats, squirrels, and bats, suggesting a common mechanism might unite these observations ( Sur et al., 1978 36. Sur, M. ∙ Nelson, R.J. ∙ Kaas, J.H. The representation of the body surface in somatosensory area I of the grey squirrel J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 179 :425-449 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar , 1980 37. Sur, M. ∙ Merzenich, M.M. ∙ Kaas, J.H. Magnification, receptive-field area, and “hypercolumn” size in areas 3b and 1 of somatosensory cortex in owl monkeys J. Neurophysiol. 1980; 44 :295-311 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we discover a stereotyped transformation during postnatal development that expands the proportion of central neurons dedicated to glabrous skin and demonstrate that remapping occurs at the first synapse between peripheral mechanoreceptors and their central targets in the brainstem.
Synaptic expansion, the ratio of postsynaptic neurons to presynaptic neurons in a neural circuit, will increase as convergence declines if other properties of the circuit remain stable ( Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017 21. Litwin-Kumar, A. ∙ Harris, K.D. ∙ Axel, R. ... Optimal Degrees of Synaptic Connectivity Neuron. 2017; 93 :1153-1164.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that convergence at LTMR-PN brainstem synapses depends on the skin region a LTMR innervates and propose that differential synaptic expansion enhances the central representation of glabrous skin. Within a skin region, representation may be proportionate to innervation density ( Lee and Woolsey, 1975 19. Lee, K.J. ∙ Woolsey, T.A. A proportional relationship between peripheral innervation density and cortical neuron number in the somatosensory system of the mouse Brain Res. 1975; 99 :349-353 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), but each skin region uniquely instructs the extent of expansion of mechanoreceptor synapses in the brainstem to disproportionately shape a collective central representation. This model reconciles previously observed discrepancies between innervation density and central representation across the body in multiple species ( Catania and Kaas, 1997 7. Catania, K.C. ∙ Kaas, J.H. The mole nose instructs the brain Somatosens. Mot. Res. 1997; 14 :56-58 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Corniani and Saal, 2020 10. Corniani, G. ∙ Saal, H.P. Tactile innervation densities across the whole body J. Neurophysiol. 2020; 124 :1229-1240 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee and Woolsey, 1975 19. Lee, K.J. ∙ Woolsey, T.A. A proportional relationship between peripheral innervation density and cortical neuron number in the somatosensory system of the mouse Brain Res. 1975; 99 :349-353 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Skin-region-dependent patterns and strengths of LTMR synaptic connections within the brainstem may reduce evolutionary constraints by flexibly tailoring body maps to disparate body forms. In the visual system, allometric scaling laws that relate the size of visual thalamus and cortex across primate species suggest that synaptic expansion enables higher-order sensory areas to explicitly represent new features of a stimulus (i.e., direction of stimulus movement) while maintaining topography ( Stevens, 2002 35. Stevens, C.F. Predicting functional properties of visual cortex from an evolutionary scaling law Neuron. 2002; 36 :139-142 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is possible that expanded glabrous skin representation in the brainstem may support the subcortical emergence of neural feature tuning. Alternatively, parallel feature computations in early somatosensory circuits are proposed to increase the speed at which the nervous system can act on mechanical feedback ( Tuthill and Wilson, 2016 39. Tuthill, J.C. ∙ Wilson, R.I. Parallel Transformation of Tactile Signals in Central Circuits of Drosophila Cell. 2016; 164 :1046-1059 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), such that disproportionate representation of glabrous skin might support parallel streams of rapid feedback underlying dexterous object manipulation.
In star-nosed moles, a star-shaped pattern of cytochrome-oxidase densities in the brainstem forms over development, with the behaviorally most-relied upon regions of the star appendage forming first and later occupying a disproportionate area ( Catania, 2001; Catania et al., 2011; Catania and Kaas, 1997 6. Catania, K.C. Early development of a somatosensory fovea: a head start in the cortical space race? Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4 :353-354 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar 7. Catania, K.C. ∙ Kaas, J.H. The mole nose instructs the brain Somatosens. Mot. Res. 1997; 14 :56-58 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar 8. Catania, K.C. ∙ Leitch, D.B. ∙ Gauthier, D. A star in the brainstem reveals the first step of cortical magnification PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e22406 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this system, disproportionate body representation may reflect an advantage that the earliest axonal arbors to arrive to the brainstem have over later arrivals, with corresponding potential roles for neural activity differences ( Catania, 2001 6. Catania, K.C. Early development of a somatosensory fovea: a head start in the cortical space race? Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4 :353-354 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). These compelling models do not account for the disproportionate representation of glabrous skin relative to hairy skin reported here, as (1) glabrous-skin- and hairy-skin-innervating peripheral neuron axonal brainstem projections have similar numbers of synapses at P14 and (2) Piezo2 mutant mice retain the relationship between skin target identity and the strength of LTMR synaptic outputs in the brainstem. Peripheral targets play key roles in controlling somatosensory neuron maturation, and skin type can instruct basic properties of peripheral neuron identity, such as the neurotransmitter they produce ( Schotzinger and Landis, 1988 33. Schotzinger, R.J. ∙ Landis, S.C. Cholinergic phenotype developed by noradrenergic sympathetic neurons after innervation of a novel cholinergic target in vivo Nature. 1988; 335 :637-639 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ; Luo et al., 2007 22. Luo, W. ∙ Wickramasinghe, S.R. ∙ Savitt, J.M. ... A hierarchical NGF signaling cascade controls Ret-dependent and Ret-independent events during development of nonpeptidergic DRG neurons Neuron. 2007; 54 :739-754 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that the skin region a mechanoreceptor innervates controls refinement of its central synapses over development to shape the representation of touch in the brain.
The proximity of a LTMRs mechanosensitive endings to glabrous skin is tightly associated with the expansiveness of its central axonal arbor in the brainstem, suggesting the possibility of a diffusible factor or cue intrinsic to glabrous skin that influences refinement of synaptic connections during postnatal developmental. This mechanism may extend beyond the central representations of gentle touch, as a recent study reported that the central arbor morphologies of a subset of nociceptors also vary by body location ( Olson et al., 2017 27. Olson, W. ∙ Abdus-Saboor, I. ∙ Cui, L. ... Sparse genetic tracing reveals regionally specific functional organization of mammalian nociceptors eLife. 2017; 6 :e29507 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Somatotopy develops in an outward-to-inward fashion, such that body maps established at lower levels of the somatosensory hierarchy drive the organization of higher regions ( Iwasato and Erzurumlu, 2018 17. Iwasato, T. ∙ Erzurumlu, R.S. Development of tactile sensory circuits in the CNS Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2018; 53 :66-75 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Extending this idea, we propose that, in addition to skin innervation density, skin target regions themselves are key determinants of disproportionate body representation in the developing brain.
This study raises several questions, some of which we highlight here. First, while we focus on skin-region-dependent developmental shifts at Aβ-LTMR-PN synapses in the brainstem, postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) neurons in the spinal cord also project to the brainstem. PSDCs may shape body representation and contribute to the heterotypic convergence estimates ( Figures 2 and 5 ). Second, we show that skin-region-dependent differences are preserved in Piezo2 mutant animals that do not sense gentle touch but cannot rule out a potential role for noxious tactile stimuli or other modalities (i.e., thermal) in the establishment of skin-region-dependent Aβ-LTMR synaptic strength ( Figure 7 ). Finally, we speculate that the ventral paw/glabrous skin either (1) instructs developing LTMRs to form more synaptic connections in the brainstem or (2) generates cues that attract LTMRs that are fated to make more synaptic connections in the brainstem, but we do not identify any such factors here. The mechanisms instructing differences in synaptic properties of mechanosensory neurons whose endings are embedded in mammalian glabrous and hairy skin are not understood and will require further experimental insight.

All mice used in the study are of mixed background. The dual recombinase-dependent Tau FSFiAP knock-in allele was generated at the Janelia Campus Research Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility using standard ES cell targeting. Briefly, a FRT-2XSTOP-FRT-5′PLAP-loxP-3′PLAP-loxP-attB-Neo-attP cassette was introduced by homologous recombination into the Tau ( Mapt) gene, replacing the first ATG of the Tau coding sequence. The PLAP coding sequence encodes human placental alkaline phosphatase and its 3′ half is inverted and flanked by head-to-head loxP sites, preventing expression in the absence of Cre recombination. TauFSF iAP heterozygous mice were generated by mating chimeric males to females constitutively expressing PhiC31( R26-PhiC31o , JAX #007670) to remove the neomycin selection cassette. Successful excision of the Neo cassette was confirmed in the next generation by PCR genotyping. The following primers were used to genotype TauFSF iAP animals for the presence of the reporter allele: forward 5′-GGATGGGAAACTGAGGCTCT-3′; reverse 5′-ATGGTGGCGAATTCCAAATCA- 3’ . R26 FSF-ReaChR mice were generated from R26 FSF-LSL-ReaChR mice (JAX # 024846)( Hooks et al., 2015 16. Hooks, B.M. ∙ Lin, J.Y. ∙ Guo, C. ...

Mice were handled and housed in standard cages in accordance with the Harvard Medical School and IACUC guidelines. Both male and female mice were used in all experiments. For fiber fraction measurements, in vivo MEA recordings, and adult anatomical and multiphoton imaging experiments, mice were age P50-P300. Anatomical, multiphoton imaging, and in vivo MEA recordings experiments in juvenile mice were conducted between P5-P15.
Animals were transcardially perfused with ice-cold choline solution comprising (in mM) 92 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 Glucose, 5 sodium ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate, 10 MgSO 4 , and 0.5 CaCl 2 adjusted to pH 7.3 with Tris Base. The brainstem and rostral spinal cord were dissected away, immersed in ice-cold choline solution and trimmed at the pons rostrally and the lower cervical spinal cord caudally. Tissue was then mounted dorsal side up and adjusted such that the surface of the dorsal column nuclei was aligned with the direction of the vibratome blade (VT1200S, Leica). An initial 25 micron slice through the remaining dura was made to permit electrode access. Subsequently, a single horizontal slice (280 - 300 μm thick) was cut such that it included the dorsal column nuclei and rostral spinal cord. Slices were transferred to an incubation chamber and bathed in ACSF comprising (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, and 25 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 for 40-60 minutes prior to recording. Immediately prior to placing them in the recording chamber, slices were allowed to adhere to poly-L-lysine coated coverslips (15mm, Warner Instruments) and placed with their dorsal surface exposed for whole-cell recording.
Whole-cell recordings were obtained with an internal solution containing (in mM): 135 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 3.3 QX314 (Cl − salt), 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 8 Na-phosphocreatine, 5 BAPTA, and 10 neurobiotin citrate, adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. Reported voltages are corrected for a −8 mV liquid junction potential between the Cs-methanesulfonate solution and the ACSF.
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a small animal stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). Under aseptic conditions, the skull was exposed and two craniotomies centered at 1.5 mm posterior and 1.9 mm lateral (bilateral) from bregma were created. To retrogradely label thalamic projection neurons residing in the DCN for whole cell recordings, a borosilicate glass pipette was lowered into the thalamus to a depth of 3.1 mm, allowed to rest for 1 minute, then retracted to 3.0mm. After 5 minutes, 100-200 nL of fluorescent retrobeads (Lumafluor) or CTB-647 (Invitrogen) was injected at a rate of 100 nl·min−1 using a Microinject system (World Precision Instruments). During surgery, mice received buprenorphine and carprofen before being returned to their home cage for at least 2 days prior to slice recording.
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from fluorescently labeled thalamic projection neurons in the gracile nucleus under visual guidance. Voltage-clamped currents were recorded with an Axopatch 700A amplifier, low-pass filtered at 10 kHz, and sampled at 40kHz by a 16 bit A/D converter (USB-6343, National Instruments) and acquired in Wavesurfer (Janelia). Neurons were clamped at −70 mV and estimates of access resistance based on the height of the fast current transient during test voltage steps were 5-20 MOhm. The dorsal column was stimulated electrically with a steel bipolar electrode (30204, FHC) or optically in mice expressing ReaChR in glabrous or hairy skin innervated Aβ-LTMRs. To optogenetically stimulate axons, the objective was positioned 1-4 mm caudal to the gracile nucleus and the field stop adjusted to produce a ∼100 micron spot of light on the ipsilateral dorsal column. Brief pulses (100-700 microsecond) of light from an LED light source (M470F3, Thor Labs) was delivered and the intensity adjusted to attain successes and failures in roughly equal proportion, thus stimulating a single fiber. Heterotypic inverse fiber fraction measurements are expressed as the ratio of the amplitude of the current evoked by saturating electrical stimulation to the optogenetic single fiber amplitude. Homotypic inverse fiber fraction measurements are expressed as the ratio of the amplitude of the current evoked by saturating optical stimulation to the optogenetic single fiber amplitude ( Litvina and Chen, 2017 20.

Glabrous skin Aβ RA-LTMRs that innervate Meissner corpuscles and hairy skin Aδ-LTMRs are both labeled in TrkB CreER ; Avil FlpO ; R26 LsL-FsF-ReaChR::mCitrine mice. However, hairy skin Aδ-LTMRs do not project up the dorsal column, and thus their axons are absent in horizontal acute brainstem slices that include the GN and dorsal column. Therefore, we used this genetic labeling strategy to preferentially activate glabrous skin Aβ RA-LTMR inputs to the GN using optogenetics ( Figure S6 ). To achieve corresponding selective genetic access to hairy skin Aβ RA-LTMR inputs in brainstem slices, we noted that Pacinian corpuscle innervating Aβ RA2-LTMRs, Meissner corpuscle innervating Aβ-LTMRs, and hairy skin Aβ RA-LTMRs are all labeled by tamoxifen administration at Ell.5 in Ret CreER mice, but hairy skin Aβ RA-LTMRs are the only population within this group that are not labeled by Pvalb FlpO ( Figure S6 ). Serendipitously, the FRT site within the neo selection cassette flanking ChR2 in Cre-dependent ChR2 transgenic mice R26 LsL-FRT-ChR2::YFP-attB-FRT-Neo-attP (Ai32D) remains unexcised, allowing for a Cre ON, Flp OFF subtractive strategy whereby Aβ RA-LTMRs that form lanceolate endings in hairy skin were selectively labeled in Ret CreER ; Pvalb FlpO ; R26 LsL-F-ChR2::YFP-F mice ( Figure S6 ). Therefore, we used TrkB CreER ; Avil FlpO ; R26 LsL-FsF-ReaChR::mCitrine mice and Ret CreER ; Pvalb FlpO ; R26 LsL-F-ChR2::YFP-F mice to selectively express an opsin in the GN terminals of either glabrous skin- or hairy skin-innervating Aβ RA-LTMRs, respectively ( Figures 6 A and S6 ).
Brainstem projection neurons were retrogradely transduced through injection of AAV2-retro viruses to their brain targets. Three to four weeks prior to imaging of the adult brainstem (or one week prior for P10-P14 imaging), mice were injected with sustained release buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg), anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a small animal stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). To target thalamic projection neurons from brainstem, the skull was exposed under aseptic conditions and two craniotomies centered at 1.5 mm posterior and 1.9 mm lateral (bilateral) from bregma were created. A borosilicate glass pipette was lowered to a depth of 3.2 mm, allowed to rest for 1 minute, then retracted to 3.1mm. After 5 minutes, 100-200 nL of rAAV2-retro jGCaMP7s (∼1e13 gc/mL, Addgene) was injected at a rate of 70 nL·min−1 using a Microinject system (World Precision Instruments). This procedure was repeated a second time to target a different location along the AP axis with a second injection in the coordinate range 1.3-1.7mm posterior to bregma. To target neurons that project to the inferior colliculus, the skin was retracted under aseptic conditions and craniotomies placed bilaterally at 0.5mm posterior to lambda and 1.5 mm lateral to the midline. A glass pipette was lowered to a depth of 1mm from the surface of the brain, then retracted to 0.7mm. After 2 minutes, 200 nL of rAAV2-retro jGCaMP7s (∼1e13 gc/mL, Addgene) was injected at a rate of 70 nL·min−1. This procedure was repeated at a second location along the A-P axis.
Mice were anesthetized with urethane (0.5-1.5 mg/g) and chlorprothixene (5 mg/kg) and placed on a bite bar (Kopf Instruments) on a custom heated recording platform. The head was flexed downward at a 45 degree angle and an incision made in the skin and overlying muscle to expose the cervical paraspinal muscles. Next, the paraspinal muscles were retracted laterally, exposing the skull and first cervical vertebra. A hemicircular cut in the skull was made with a dental drill and a posterior section of the skull overlying the cerebellum removed. The posterior atlanto-occipital membrane was carefully removed through incision directly rostral to the atlas and laterally to the occipital condyles. The dural membrane was then retracted caudally through insertion of a Bonn microprobe (Fine Science Tools) between the cerebellum and dorsal surface of the brainstem. An imaging chamber that stabilizes the brainstem and displaces the cerebellum rostrally was fabricated from a circular 3mm glass coverslip (CS-3R, Warner Instruments) and flanged stainless tube (Microgroup) attached to a titanium plate and mounted to a 3d micromanipulator (MMN-1, Narishige). The assembly was lowered onto the caudal brainstem just rostral to the atlas and downward pressure applied to the brainstem surface until there was no apparent motion. The assembly was then translated dorsally to displace the cerebellum, centered on the obex, and the interface between the imaging chamber and skin sealed with adhesive. Healthy long-term preparations were associated with pressures that stabilized the brainstem cardiac and respiratory motions while avoiding full exsanguination of the spinal vertebral and penetrating arteries. In a small fraction of animals, arterial elaboration over the gracile nucleus made imaging infeasible.
Two-photon calcium imaging was performed using a resonant multiphoton microscope (Scientifica) equipped with a piezoelectric objective Z-stepper (P-726, Physik Instrumente). All images were acquired using a 16X, 0.80 NA, 3 mm WD objective (Nikon) with scan mirror excursions that produced a 510 × 510 μm 2 field of view. Volumetric data was captured by acquiring 4-6 planes with a sawtooth scan configuration, yielding a volumetric imaging rate of 7.5 - 5 Hz. Each FOV was at least 20 μm below or above an adjacent FOV for cell body imaging. Excitation light was provided by a Ti:Sapphire laser (80 MHz, Vision S, Coherent) tuned to 910-925nm with pre-chirp dispersion compensation. Laser powers measured at the front aperture of the objective were between 15 - 60 mW depending on imaging depth. Complete coverage of the gracile nucleus typically required eight tiled multiphoton imaging volumes.
Calcium imaging time series (512 × 512 pixels) were initially registered to a reference image to correct for motion in the rostal-caudal and medial-lateral directions. ROIs containing putative cells were automatically detected based on their morphology and time-varying indicator fluorescence from the aligned image series and manually curated to remove extraneous cell profiles. Signals were extracted as the average value in each ROI sampled at the volumetric frame rate using Suite2P and corrected for signal contamination from surrounding neuropil as F neuropil_corrected (t) = F ROI (t) – 0.7 x F neuropil (t). Touch stimuli were ∼10mm long skin strokes delivered once per second from the proximal to distal direction with a soft, 1.5 mm wide brush (Blick Art Materials, Boston MA). Stroke was delivered for 8 s to a given body region with 16 s inter-trial intervals. Cells were considered responsive if their average fluorescence exceeded the baseline plus 2.5 times the standard deviation of the baseline for 30% of the stimulus period.
For dorsal column injections, mice were placed on the stereotactic frame with their neck bent at a 45 degree angle. The dorsal column was exposed between the C1-C2 levels through retraction of the paraspinal muscles and the overlying laminar and dural membranes removed prior to injection. For neuronal innervation density estimates, 100-200 nL of rAAV2/1-Cre virus (Penn Viral Core, diluted to 2E12 vg/mL) was injected into the dorsal column 200 microns below the spinal cord surface. For optogenetic measures of convergence, 300 nL of undiluted virus (1e13 gc/mL) was injected bilaterally. Incisions were sutured and the animal was allowed to recover before being returned to its home cage for postoperative monitoring.
Mice P6 and older were anesthetized with continuous inhalation of 2% isoflurane from a precision vaporizer for the duration of the procedure (5-10 min). The animal’s breathing rate was monitored throughout the procedure and the anesthetic dose adjusted as needed. The skin region of interest was swabbed with ethanol. Injections were done with a beveled borosilicate or quartz glass pipette. Forceps were used to stabilize the skin while the needle was inserted into the dermis, injecting 0.5-2 μL of virus. Mice were injected in 1-6 locations within the skin region of interest, depending on skin identity and the amount of labeling desired. Mice harboring CreER alleles along with a dual recombinase fluorescent or alkaline phosphatase reporter were injected with AAV2/1-hSyn-FlpO (1.37e13, Boston Children’s Hospital Viral Core) to target select LTMR subtypes. Mice harboring a Cre dependent reporter allele were injected with AAV2-retro-hSyn-Cre (1.2e13, Addgene 105553), while mice harboring a Flp-dependent reporter allele were injected with AAV2/1-hSyn-FlpO (1.37e13, Boston Children’s Hospital Viral Core). Wild-type mice were injected with AAV2/1-hSyn-synaptophysin-TdTomato (1e14, UPenn Viral Core) or AAV2/1-synaptophysin-mScarlet (1.4e13, Boston Children’s Hospital Viral Core). For all injections, a small amount of fast green (Sigma F7252-5G) in 0.9% saline was added to the virus. After injection, mice recovered from anesthesia on a warm pad while being monitored, and animals where fast green was not visible after ten minutes were not used subsequently, as this indicates subdermal spread of virus. Mice were returned to the litter once normal activity had resumed. Five weeks post-injection (1 week post-injection for p14 animals) animals were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion under isoflurane anesthesia. A subset of animals were screened following tissue collection to confirm that viral transduction was restricted to DRGs at somatotopically appropriate segmental levels (C7-C8 for forepaw injections, L3-L5 for hindpaw injections).
Mice were anesthetized under isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 5-10mL of Ames Media (Sigma) in 1xPBS with heparin (10 U/mL), followed by 5-10 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1xPBS. After perfusion, the skull, vertebral column, and central nervous system were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA in 1xPBS at 4°C overnight. Skin samples were removed and treated with commercial depilatory cream (NAIR, Church and Dwight Co.; Princeton, NJ) for 3-5 minutes, then washed with soap and water. Skin samples were fixed overnight in Zamboni’s fixation buffer with gentle agitation at 4°C. Samples were washed 3x10min in 1xPBS at room temp after overnight fixation before fine dissection.
The brain, brainstem, and spinal cord were removed from the skull and vertebral column. The skull was cut down the midline and pulled laterally to remove. The dorsal and ventral sides of the vertebral column were removed. Then, forceps were used to remove the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) bilaterally from the vertebral column and surrounding tissue, retaining the connection to the spinal cord. This was done for all DRGs working from lumbar to cervical levels. Once all DRGs had been removed, the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord could be extracted from the vertebral column and stored in 1x PBS.
Sectioning of tissue samples was done using a vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT100S). Samples were embedded in 3% agarose in 1x PBS. Once solidified, samples were trimmed and attached to the sectioning plate with superglue. Transverse brainstem and spinal cord sections were taken at 100 μm while horizontal brain sections were taken at 200 μm. Tissue samples were then rinsed in 50% ethanol/water solution for 30 minutes, followed by 3x 10 min in 2xPBS. Tissue samples were incubated in a mixture of primary antibodies in high salt Phosphate Buffer Saline (2x PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-1000 (2xPBSt) for 72 hours at 4°C. Primary antibodies used in this study: Guinea pig anti-Vglut1 1:1000 (Sigma AB5905), Rabbit anti-Homer1 1:500 (CedarLane 160003SY), Goat anti-mCherry 1:500 (CedarLane AB0040-200), Chicken anti-GFP 1:500 (Aves GFP-1020), Rabbit anti-tRFP 1:500 (Evrogen AB233), Rabbit anti-S100 1:300 (VWR/ProteinTech 15146-1-AP), Chick anti-Neurofilament 200 kDa 1:500 (Aves NFH). The tissue was rinsed 3x10 min with 2xPBS before incubation in the secondary antibody solution for 24 hours at 4°C. The secondary antibody solution was made up in 2xPBSt and contained species-specific Alexa Fluor 488, 546, and 647 conjugated IgGs. Secondary antibodies used in this study: Donkey anti-Guinea pig Alexa Fluor 647 1:500 (Jackson Immunoresearch 706-605-148), Donkey anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 1:1000 (ThermoFisher A-21206), Donkey anti-Goat IgG Alexa Fluor 546 1:1000 (LifeTech A11056), Donkey anti-Chicken IgG Alexa Fluor 488 1:1000 (Jackson Immunoresearch 703-545-155), Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG DyLight 405 1:1000 (Jackson Immunoresearch 711-475-152). The tissue was then mounted on glass slides, coverslipped in VectaMount mounting medium (Vector labs H-5000) and stored at 4°C until imaging.
Paws were roughly dissected from perfused mice and hair was removed with a commercial depilatory cream (Nair, Church & Dwight). Glabrous and hairy tissue was finely dissected from the paws, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 1x PBS at 4 ° C for 2 days, embedded in OCT (1437365, Fisher), frozen using dry ice, and kept at −80 ° C. The tissues were cyrosectioned (25 μm) using a cryostat (Leica) and collected on glass slides (12-550-15, Fisher). Sections were washed 3 times for 5 minutes each with 1x PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (0.1% PBST), incubated with blocking solutions (0.1% PBST containing 5% normal goat serum (S-1000, Vector Labs) or normal donkey serum (005-000-121, Jackson Immuno)) for 1 hour at RT, incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solutions at 4 ° C overnight, washed 3 times for 10 minutes each with 0.1% PBST, incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solutions at 4 ° C overnight, washed again 4 times for 10 minutes each with 0.1% PBST (DAPI solution was included in the second wash at 1:5000 dilution), and mounted in Fluoromount-G mounting medium (Fisher 0100-01).
MEAs were inserted into the L4 dorsal root ganglia (H6b-32ch or E4-64ch, Cambridge Neurotech), gracile nucleus of the brainstem (E1-16ch or H6-64ch, Cambridge Neurotech), primary somatosensory cortex (F3-32ch or E4-64 ch) or inferior colliculus (H6b-32ch, Cambridge Neurotech) with a 3-axes micromanipulator (IVM mini, Scientifica). MEA signals were high-pass filtered at 200 Hz, amplified (RHD2132) and acquired at 20kHz (RHD2000, Intantech) for offline processing.
Data was converted into contiguous binary files ( https://github.com/peltonen/kwik-tools ) and processed using JRClust (Janelia). After pre-processing and filtering, spikes that exceeded detection thresholds defined as qq factors that were adjusted (4.5-6.0) based on recording site and probe. Spikes were detected and assigned to clusters corresponding to individual or multiples units with JRClust ( https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/JRCLUST ). These initial clusters were manually curated to remove artifacts that did not correspond to spike waveforms, and clusters were examined and split if their PCA decompositions were not monodisperse. This collection of clusters was then examined and merge operations performed if consideration of the average spike waveform and spiking cross-correlation indicated that two clusters corresponded to the same neuron. Manual curation typically resulted in putative isolated single units with intra-cluster waveform correlations greater than 0.9, inter-cluster waveform correlations less than 0.1, and clusters that did not meet these criteria were not considered in the dataset. Clusters computed in this manner contained units with spatially distinct receptive fields, suggesting that units were drawn from non-overlapping sources. Spikes event times for each cluster were exported and processed in Python.
Hair was removed from the hindlimb ipsilateral to site of optical stimulation with a commercial depilatory cream (Nair, Church & Dwight). The leg and foot were immobilized with adhesive tape and positioned underneath a custom-built optical skin stimulator. Next, an image of the animal was taken along the axis of optical stimulation through a high-pass dichroic with a monochrome camera (FLIR Systems). The stimulator mirrors were parked at their origin and the skin illuminated with low power laser light. A subsequent image of the paw and laser illuminated spot was captured. This procedure allowed for the centering and orienting of maps derived from optical stimuli onto the skin.
The optical stimulator was constructed from a laser light source (445 nm, 100 mW), a beam expander (GBE03-A, Thor Labs), galvometer scan mirrors (6210H, Cambridge Technologies), an f-theta lens (FTH-160-1064-M39, Thor Labs), and a front end dichroic (FF660-Di02-25x36 Semrock) for dividing the optical path between the stimulator and camera. The recorded latencies between optical stimulation and GN neuron spiking were consistent with direct synaptic input from Aβ-LTMRs after accounting for the time required to transit the dorsal column, the delay across the synapse, and the time for spike generation, but may also include indirect input from the post-synaptic dorsal column pathway.
A spike-triggered average based analysis was used to describe the receptive fields of mechanically sensitive neurons rendered optically responsive through expression of the channelrhodopsin variant ReaChR ( Hooks et al., 2015 16. Hooks, B.M. ∙ Lin, J.Y. ∙ Guo, C. ... Dual-channel circuit mapping reveals sensorimotor convergence in the primary motor cortex J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :4418-4426 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Optical receptive fields were estimated for each recorded unit that responded to sparse white noise optical stimulation of the skin according to the equation (cite Pillow): 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 | 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 ) = 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 | 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 ) × 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁡ ( 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 ) P r ⁡ ( 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 ) To compute Pr(spike | stimulus), we first binned spikes from each unit at 1 msec to produce a [N x 1] binary vector of spike occurrences, where N is the number of discrete time bins encompassing the recording. Next, the stimulus was binned at each time step into a 2d spatial histogram with 100 micron bin edges to produce a matrix indicating stimulation of a given location. This was subsequently flattened in column-major order to produce a [M x N] stimulus matrix, where M is the number of (binned) spatial locations and N is the number of discrete time bins. Next, a design matrix [(M x mkt) x N] containing the relevant regressors for each time bin was constructed from the stimulus matrix by collecting all space-time stimulus elements within a time window of nkt samples. The spike triggered stimulus average with dimensions [M x nkt] is the product of the design matrix and the spike vector. This was used to compute the quantity Pr(spike | stimulus) according to the equation above by dividing by the raw stimulus ensemble. For DRG neurons, displayed spatial receptive fields were produced from the spike-triggered average by integrating over the response window (4-6 msec) are overlayed over an image of the paw.
A circular craniotomy with a diameter of 3.1 mm was made over right primary somatosensory cortex (stereotaxic coordinates: 0 mm anterior-posterior, 1.8 mm lateral of bregma). A titanium headplate was cemented to the mouse’s skull (C&B Metabond) and the craniotomy covered with Kwik-sil adhesive until the day of recording. The mouse was lightly anesthetized with urethane (.2g/kg) and chloroprothixene (1mg/kg), placed on a heated platform and headfixed such that the paws on the side contralateral to the craniomety were extended for mechanical stimulation.
We used Ret CreER , TrkC CreER , or Ptgfr CreER to label Aβ rapidly adapting (RA)-LTMRs in hairy and glabrous paw skin ( Ret CreER ); Aβ slowly adapting (SA) type I-LTMRs in hairy and glabrous paw skin ( TrkC CreER ), or Aβ Field-LTMRs in hairy paw skin and a previously uncharacterized sensory neuron in glabrous paw skin that will be described elsewhere ( Ptgfr CreER ) ( Luo et al., 2009 23.

Four weeks post virus injection (1 week for P14 animals), animals were transcardially perfused using 4% paraformaldehyde. Skin and paws were cut off, hair was removed using NAIR, and skin was post-fixed in Zamboni solution at 4°C overnight. Spinal cords and brainstems were post-fixed in 4% PFA, 4°C overnight. The next day, tissue was washed three times in 1xPBS and stored in PBS at 4°C until further processing.
To visualize brainstem arbors by sparse labeling, three different strategies were used. To sparsely label all cutaneous neurons that send ascending projections to the dorsal column nuclei, Brn3a cKOAP /+ animals aged 8-15 days were injected with AAV2/retro-hSyn-Cre virus into hairy or glabrous paw skin. 4-5 weeks post virus injection, animals were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and skin and CNS were collected as described above. After fine dissection, brainstems were processed for whole-mount alkaline phosphatase staining (see below). For all animals with sparse labeling of DCN arbors in the gracile or cuneate nucleus (1-4 arbors per animal), the corresponding paws were dissected and stained to identify the position and morphology of the labeled cutaneous arbor. Only neurons with somatotopically unambiguously identified peripheral arbors were used for further analysis. To label specific genetic classes of LTMRs, Ret CreER or Ptgfr CreER mice were crossed to Brn3a cKOAP/+ mice to generate CreER/+; AP/+ animals. Low dosage tamoxifen (∼0.01 mg) was delivered by oral gavage of pregnant females at E11.5 ( Ret CreER ) or intraperitoneal injection of pups at P21 ( Ptgfr CreER ). This method yielded a low success rate of animals with unambiguous, sparse labeling in paws. Therefore, to allow for higher throughput sparse labeling of genetically identified arbors innervating specific skin regions, we generated and used Tau FSFiAP , a dual Cre and FlpO-dependent AP allele. Animals containing CreER alleles (Ret CreER , TrkC CreER , or Ptgfr CreER ) and the Tau FSFiAP allele were administered high doses of tamoxifen to maximize Cre-dependent recombination. Then, AAV-FlpO virus was injected to glabrous or hairy paw skin at P8-P10. 5-6 weeks post virus injection, animals were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and their brainstems and paws were dissected and processed for whole-mount alkaline phosphatase staining. The Tau FSFiAP allele was also used to sparsely label neurons innervating Meissner corpuscles by generating Ret CreER /+; Pvalb FlpO /+; Tau FSFiAP /+ mice and delivering 0.025-0.05 mg tamoxifen intraperitoneally at P5-P7.
Mice were fixed via transcardial perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde in preparation for whole-mount alkaline phosphatase staining. After post-fixation, tissue was washed 3x in 1XPBS, incubated at 65°C for 2-2.5 hours, and washed with B3 buffer (0.1 M Tris pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20) 3x5 min, at room temperature. AP signal was detected by incubating tissue in NBT/BCIP (Roche) diluted at 3.4 μg/mL in B3 buffer at room temperature, for 22-30 hr with gentle rocking. To stop the AP reaction, tissue was incubated in 4% PFA at room temperature for 1 hour, washed 3x 5 min in 1XPBS, and then dehydrated (1 hour 50% ethanol, 1 hour 70% ethanol, 1 hour 100% ethanol followed by overnight incubation in 100% ethanol) before clearing with BABB (1 part benzyl benzoate:2 parts benzyl alcohol) for 4 hours at room temperature. Paws and brainstems were imaged on a Zeiss AxioZoom microscope.
To label pre-synaptic boutons of cutaneous sensory neurons, R26 syt-tdTomato (Ai34) animals were injected with AAV2/retro-Cre virus, or wild-type animals (CD1) were injected with AAV2-retro-synaptophysin-tdTomato or AAV2-retro-synaptophysin-mScarlet virus into the hairy or glabrous paw dermis at P5-P15. Animals were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde 5-6 weeks post injection for adult time points (P50-P70), or 1 week post injection for developmental time points (P14). After overnight post-fixation in 4% PFA at 4°C and three washes in 1xPBS, dorsal column nuclei were finely dissected and sectioned transversely on the vibratome at 90-100 μm/section. Antibody staining was performed as described above. Sections were mounted in VectaMount and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using a 40x oil-immersion lens. To quantify boutons, syn-FP + puncta were identified semi-automatically using Imaris (Bitplane). Automatic thresholding and background subtraction were applied to all images. Total syn-FP + puncta were identified using the Spot tool with manual curation. Co-localization with vGlut1 or Homer1 puncta was assessed manually after bouton identification for a subset of images. Pre-synaptic boutons were found both at arbor end points and along the length of axonal fibers, at an equivalent density in glabrous and hairy neurons ( Figure S4 ).
AAVs encoding nuclear restricted fluorescent proteins, rAAV2-retro-hSyn-H2B-GFP-bGH (5.3E12 gc/mL) and AAV2-retro-hSyn-H2B-mTagBFP2-bGH (3.17E13 gc/mL), were stereotactically injected into the thalamus and the inferior colliculus (approximately 300nl per location) of Gad2 T2A-NLS-mCherry . Sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. To quantify overlap of labeled nuclei, fluorescent nuclei were identified semi-automatically using Imaris. Quantification of labeled nuclei and colocalization was obtained using the Spot tool with manual curation.
Tamoxifen (Sigma T5648) was dissolved in 100% ethanol to 20 mg/mL, (30 minutes vortexing at room temperature) and then mixed in 2X volume sunflower seed oil (Sigma S5007) and vacuum centrifuged for 30 minutes to evaporate the ethanol. 20 mg/mL tamoxifen aliquots in sunflower seed oil were stored at −80°C until the day of use, when they were thawed 30 minutes at room temperature, while protected from light, and if necessary further dissolved in sunflower seed oil before administering to mice. Pregnant mice received 0.02 mg – 3 mg tamoxifen by oral gavage at E11.5 (to label Aβ RA-LTMRs using Ret CreER mice), E12.5 (to label Aβ SA1-LTMRs using TrkC CreER mice), or E13.5-E16.5 (to label glabrous skin innervating Aβ RA-LTMRs using TrkB CreER mice). To label Aβ field/free-LTMRs, Ptgfr CreER animals were administered tamoxifen postnatally by intraperitoneal injection at P21. The amount of tamoxifen delivered was titrated according to experimental needs.
Detection of Piezo2 and Nefh transcripts was performed by fluorescent i n situ hybridization, as described in ( Sharma et al., 2020 34. Sharma, N. ∙ Flaherty, K. ∙ Lezgiyeva, K. ... The emergence of transcriptional identity in somatosensory neurons Nature. 2020; 577 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, individual DRG ganglia were rapidly dissected from euthanized mice and frozen in dry-ice cooled 2 methylbutane and stored at −80°C until further processing. DRGs were cryosectioned at a thickness of 20 μm and RNA was detected using RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The following probes were used: Mm Piezo2 exons 43-45 (Cat# 439971-C3), tdTomato (Cat# 317041), Mm-Nefh (Cat# 443671). Sections were mounted in FluoroMount-G (Fisher 0100-01) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using a 40x oil-immersion lens.
Statistical tests were conducted in Python 3.7.9 using the SciPy stats module or in GraphPad Prism. Non-parametric tests and parametric tests were used for comparing two independent groups (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test or Welch’s t test), two related groups (Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and multiple groups (Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction). p < 0.05 was considered significant. Additional details on sample sizes and statistical tests for each experiment can be found in figure legends and the main text.
