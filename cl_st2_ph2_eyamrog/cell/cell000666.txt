Title: Microbiota imbalance induced by dietary sugar disrupts immune-mediated protection from metabolic syndrome


Abstract: Summary

How intestinal microbes regulate metabolic syndrome is incompletely understood. We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells. Sugar and ILC3 promoted outgrowth of Faecalibaculum rodentium that displaced Th17-inducing microbiota. These results define dietary and microbiota factors posing risk for metabolic syndrome. They also define a microbiota-dependent mechanism for immuno-pathogenicity of dietary sugar and highlight an elaborate interaction between diet, microbiota, and intestinal immunity in regulation of metabolic disorders.

Section: Introduction

Obesity and metabolic syndrome are complex physiological conditions that lead to many pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ( Global et al., 2016 22.

Body-mass index and all-cause mortality: individual-participant-data meta-analysis of 239 prospective studies in four continents Lancet. 2016; 388 :776-786 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dietary changes are a major factor for the increase in incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome ( GBD 2015, 2017 1. The GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators ∙ Afshin, A. ∙ Forouzanfar, M.H. ...

Med. 2019; 381 :2440-2450 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In both humans and mice, Western-style high-fat diet (HFD) initiates a cascade of events that ultimately result in obesity and obesity-associated metabolic complications, such as metabolic syndrome and T2D. Although much is known about later-stage pathophysiology of these conditions, the initiating events are incompletely understood. In addition, the role of non-fat dietary components is not well established. For example, whether sugar content in diets is a significant contributor to metabolic syndrome is debatable, and the mechanisms by which sugar may drive metabolic disorders are unclear ( Macdonald, 2016 47.

Stanhope, K.L. Sugar consumption, metabolic disease and obesity: The state of the controversy Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab Sci. 2016; 53 :52-67 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intestine is the largest immune organ and interfaces dietary antigens with the host. The intestinal immune system has emerged as an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis ( Khan et al., 2021 36. Khan, S. ∙ Luck, H. ∙ Winer, S. ...

Winer, D. ∙ Luck, H. ∙ Tsai, S. ... The Intestinal Immune System in Obesity and Insulin Resistance Cell Metab. 2016; 23 :413-426 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). HFD has been implicated in increasing intestinal inflammation, which can contribute to endotoxemia and adipose tissue inflammation ( Kawano et al., 2016 34. Kawano, Y. ∙ Nakae, J. ∙ Watanabe, N. ...

Regulation of obesity-related insulin resistance with gut anti-inflammatory agents Cell Metab. 2015; 21 :527-542 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mechanisms by which HFD increases intestinal inflammation, as well as the dietary components mediating these changes, have not been defined. Moreover, how mucosal immune cells affect diet-induced obesity (DIO) and metabolic syndrome is unclear.
CD4 T cells play a central role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and direct the nature of immune responses in the gut and other tissues. However, the contribution of individual T helper subsets to metabolic syndrome is less clear. T helper (Th)17 cells can promote metabolic syndrome-associated inflammatory phenotypes ( Dalmas et al., 2014 15. Dalmas, E. ∙ Venteclef, N. ∙ Caer, C. ...

Similarly, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and ILC3-derived IL-22 have been reported to exert both protective and promoting effects in metabolic syndrome ( Upadhyay et al., 2012 68.

Therefore, the role of type 3 immune cells seems complex and possibly context dependent; however, the nature of the environmental, or other, signals controlling this heterogeneity of function is not known.
Microbiota are important modulators of intestinal immunity, including T cell and ILC3 responses ( Honda and Littman, 2016 26. Honda, K. ∙ Littman, D.R. The microbiota in adaptive immune homeostasis and disease Nature. 2016; 535 :75-84 Crossref Scopus (1254) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ivanov et al., 2022 30. Ivanov, II ∙ Tuganbaev, T. ∙ Skelly, A.N. ... T Cell Responses to the Microbiota Annual Review of Immunology. 2022;, 2022 Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar ). HFD induces changes in microbiota composition that play crucial role in obesity phenotypes ( Ley et al., 2006 44. Ley, R.E. ∙ Turnbaugh, P.J. ∙ Klein, S. ...

Diet-induced obesity is linked to marked but reversible alterations in the mouse distal gut microbiome Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2323) PubMed Google Scholar ). HFD microbiota can promote metabolic syndrome by increasing energy harvest, including calory extraction and intestinal lipid absorption ( Petersen et al., 2019 56.

Wang, Y. ∙ Kuang, Z. ∙ Yu, X. ... The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL3 and the circadian clock Science. 2017; 357 :912-916 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), or by inducing intestinal epithelial barrier disruption and endotoxemia, leading to adipose tissue inflammation ( Cani et al., 2008 11. Cani, P.D. ∙ Bibiloni, R. ∙ Knauf, C. ... Changes in gut microbiota control metabolic endotoxemia-induced inflammation in high-fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice Diabetes. 2008; 57 :1470-1481 Crossref Scopus (3781) PubMed Google Scholar ). HFD-associated microbiota can also affect metabolic syndrome by modulating immune responses ( Tilg et al., 2020 64. Tilg, H. ∙ Zmora, N. ∙ Adolph, T.E. ... The intestinal microbiota fuelling metabolic inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :40-54 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar ). The dietary and microbiota entities that regulate host immunity in the context of metabolic syndrome, as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, are not known.
Here, we examined the role of microbiota-controlled intestinal immunity, and in particular type 3 immunity, in early induction of DIO and metabolic syndrome. We found that microbiota-induced Th17 cells are protective against DIO and metabolic syndrome. We identified dietary and microbiota components involved, how these components modify Th17 cell-inducing microbiota, and the mechanisms by which they control metabolic syndrome in a context-dependent manner. We also propose an alternative explanation for the pathogenic role of sugar in metabolic disease through suppression of immuno-protective microbiota.

Section: Results

To identify initiating events in metabolic syndrome, we examined the effects of HFD on intestinal immune homeostasis at 4 weeks, prior to development of inflammatory changes in adipose tissue ( Cani et al., 2008 11. Cani, P.D. ∙ Bibiloni, R. ∙ Knauf, C. ... Changes in gut microbiota control metabolic endotoxemia-induced inflammation in high-fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice Diabetes. 2008; 57 :1470-1481 Crossref Scopus (3781) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kawano et al., 2016 34. Kawano, Y. ∙ Nakae, J. ∙ Watanabe, N. ... Colonic Pro-inflammatory Macrophages Cause Insulin Resistance in an Intestinal Ccl2/Ccr2-Dependent Manner Cell Metab. 2016; 24 :295-310 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to normal chow diet (NCD), WT mice fed HFD developed metabolic syndrome characteristics, including weight gain, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance ( Figure S1 A–S1C). In the small intestinal lamina propria (SI LP), HFD led to a significant decrease in the proportion and total numbers of RORγt + Foxp3 neg Th17 cells ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 D) but had no apparent effect on RORγt neg or RORγt + Foxp3 + Tregs ( Figures 1 C and S1E). Moreover, remaining RORγt + Th17 cells had decreased expression of RORγt ( Figure 1 D), suggesting general loss of Th17 cell functionality. Cytokine staining revealed a corresponding decrease in percentage and total numbers of IL-17 + Th17 cells ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 F) and severely reduced tissue levels of Il17 transcripts in the terminal ileum ( Figure 1 G) in HFD-fed animals. At the same time, HFD did not affect the levels of other RORγt or IL-17-expressing populations, such as RORγt + γδ T cells or total ILC3 ( Figures S1 G and S1H). However, HFD feeding was associated with an increase in the proportion of SI LP Th1 cells ( Figure 1 H), as well as a relative enrichment of CCR6 + ILC3 ( Figures S1 I–S1L), a subset that produces high levels of IL-22 ( Klose and Artis, 2016 37. Klose, C.S.N. ∙ Artis, D. Innate lymphoid cells as regulators of immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :765-774 Crossref Scopus (736) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, at 4 weeks, major inflammatory immune cell subsets in visceral adipose tissue were not significantly changed ( Figures S1 M and S1N). Therefore, HFD leads to specific decrease in intestinal Th17 cell immunity. The loss of SI LP Th17 cells occurred by day 7 following transition to HFD ( Figure 1 I) and preceded the increase in inflammatory LP Th1 cells ( Figure S1 O).
We previously showed that SI LP Th17 cells in specific-pathogen free (SPF) mice are induced by commensal microbiota, particularly segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) ( Goto et al., 2014 23. Goto, Y. ∙ Panea, C. ∙ Nakato, G. ... Segmented filamentous bacteria antigens presented by intestinal dendritic cells drive mucosal Th17 cell differentiation Immunity. 2014; 40 :594-607 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ivanov et al., 2009 29. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Atarashi, K. ∙ Manel, N. ... Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria Cell. 2009; 139 :485-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3584) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we investigated whether HFD affects SFB levels. Transition to HFD led to rapid loss of SFB from both feces and ileal mucosa ( Figures 1 J and 1 K). Notably, SFB loss preceded the loss of Th17 cells ( Figures 1 I and 1J) and occurred in Th17 cell-deficient animals ( Figure S1 P). Thus, the decrease in SI LP Th17 cells following transition to HFD is secondary to the loss of SFB. To confirm that HFD-induced SFB loss eliminates the induction of SFB-specific Th17 cells, we adoptively transferred congenic SFB-specific 7B8 TCR Tg T cells ( Yang et al., 2014 78. Yang, Y. ∙ Torchinsky, M.B. ∙ Gobert, M. ... Focused specificity of intestinal TH17 cells towards commensal bacterial antigens Nature. 2014; 510 :152-156 Crossref Scopus (398) PubMed Google Scholar ) into SFB-positive mice fed NCD or HFD ( Figure 1 L). 7B8 CD4 T cells expanded and differentiated into Th17 cells in NCD controls ( Figures 1 M−1O). In contrast, SFB-specific CD4 T cells did not expand or generate Th17 cells in HFD-fed animals ( Figures 1 M−1O). These results demonstrate that both SFB and SFB-derived T cell antigens are lost following transition to HFD. Collectively, these data suggest that HFD induces rapid loss of Th17 cell-inducing microbiota that leads to loss of homeostatic commensal Th17 cells prior to development of metabolic syndrome.
We also investigated the abundance of previously reported human Th17 cell-inducing bacteria in a published microbiota dataset from non-diabetic adults with or without increased body mass index and metabolic syndrome ( Pedersen et al., 2016 53. Pedersen, H.K. ∙ Gudmundsdottir, V. ∙ Nielsen, H.B. ... Human gut microbes impact host serum metabolome and insulin sensitivity Nature. 2016; 535 :376-381 Crossref Scopus (1437) PubMed Google Scholar ). A significantly higher proportion of adults with metabolic syndrome showed depletion of community of 20 human Th17-inducing bacteria ( Atarashi et al., 2015 4. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Ando, M. ... Th17 Cell Induction by Adhesion of Microbes to Intestinal Epithelial Cells Cell. 2015; 163 :367-380 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (803) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 Q). Metabolic syndrome adults also had decreased relative abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis ( Tan et al., 2016 63. Tan, T.G. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ... Identifying species of symbiont bacteria from the human gut that, alone, can induce intestinal Th17 cells in mice Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2016; 113 :E8141-E8150 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ) but not Eggerthella lenta ( Alexander et al., 2022 2. Alexander, M. ∙ Ang, Q.Y. ∙ Nayak, R.R. ... Human gut bacterial metabolism drives Th17 activation and colitis Cell host & microbe. 2022; 30 :17-30.e9 e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S1 R and S1S). Therefore, metabolic syndrome may also negatively affect Th17-inducing microbiota in humans.
Both Th17 cells and ILC3 have been implicated in protection from metabolic syndrome ( Garidou et al., 2015 21. Garidou, L. ∙ Pomie, C. ∙ Klopp, P. ...

Interleukin-22 alleviates metabolic disorders and restores mucosal immunity in diabetes Nature. 2014; 514 :237-241 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ) and are regulated by SFB ( Ivanov et al., 2009 29. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Atarashi, K. ∙ Manel, N. ...

Therefore, we examined the differential role of Th17 cells and ILC3 in metabolic syndrome. Traditionally, this has been difficult to ascertain because all currently available ILC3-depletion models also have perturbed T cell development and/or Th17 differentiation ( Klose and Artis, 2016 37. Klose, C.S.N. ∙ Artis, D. Innate lymphoid cells as regulators of immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :765-774 Crossref Scopus (736) PubMed Google Scholar , Tait Wojno and Artis, 2016 62. Tait Wojno, E.D. ∙ Artis, D.

Vivier, E. ∙ Artis, D. ∙ Colonna, M. ... Innate Lymphoid Cells: 10 Years On Cell. 2018; 174 :1054-1066 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1406) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated a genetic model in which ILC3 development is selectively impaired while preserving the T cell compartment ( Figure S2 ). We first generated RORγ-STOP-flox (STOP) mice that lack both ILC3 and Th17 cells ( Figure S2 A). These animals phenocopy RORγ-knockout (KO) animals ( Figures S2 B–S2G; data not shown). They have perturbed T cell development in the thymus and do not generate Th17 cells (including SI LP Th17 cells) or ILC3 ( Figures S2 B–S2G). We crossed STOP mice to T cell-specific CD4-Cre animals to recover RORγ expression in double-positive thymocytes (hence in all T cells). The resulting STOP/CD4-Cre (STOP/CD4) mice recover most αβ T cell development and recover SI LP Th17 cell differentiation but maintain other immune deficiencies present in STOP mice, including the lack of ILC3 ( Figures S2 B–S2G).
SFB-negative STOP, STOP/CD4, and WT littermate controls were colonized with SFB and fed HFD. After transition to HFD, WT animals quickly lost SFB as before. In contrast, HFD did not lead to loss of SFB in ILC3-deficient mice (STOP or STOP/CD4) ( Figures 2 A and 2 B), suggesting that ILC3 are required for the HFD-mediated loss of SFB. Irrespective of SFB, HFD-fed STOP mice did not generate Th17 cells and had decreased levels of Il17a transcripts in the terminal ileum ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and S3 A). In contrast, STOP/CD4 mice colonized with SFB maintained high levels of SI LP Th17 cells even under HFD ( Figures 2 C and S3 A). As expected, SFB-negative STOP/CD4 mice lacked SI LP Th17 cells ( Figure 2 D).
Next, we compared the development of DIO and metabolic syndrome in ILC3/Th17-deficient STOP mice and ILC3-deficient/Th17-sufficient STOP/CD4 mice. In the absence of SFB-induced Th17 cells ( Figure 2 D), both strains of ILC3-deficient mice demonstrated weight gain ( Figure 2 E) and metabolic syndrome phenotypes, i.e., increased insulin resistance and glucose intolerance ( Figures 2 F, 2G and S3 B). Moreover, weight gain and metabolic syndrome phenotypes in ILC3-deficient STOP and SFB-negative STOP/CD4 mice were slightly, but significantly, increased compared to WT controls ( Figures 2 E–2J, S3 B, and S3C). In the presence of SFB Th17 cells ( Figure 2 C), STOP/CD4 mice resembled NCD-fed WT controls and were protected from DIO, including weight gain ( Figure 2 H) and increased adiposity ( Figures S3 D and S3E), as well as from pre-diabetic phenotypes associated with metabolic syndrome ( Figures 2 I,2J, and S3 C). Protection was not mediated by changes in brown fat adiposity or food intake ( Figures S3 F and S3G). In addition to maintaining SI LP Th17 cells ( Figure 2 C), HFD-fed SFB-positive STOP/CD4 mice had significantly decreased levels of transcripts for the Th1 cytokine IFNγ in the SI LP compared to HFD-fed WT or STOP mice ( Figure S3 H). They also demonstrated decreased liver pathology, including decreased bacterial translocation and expression of Tnfa transcripts ( Figures 2 K and 2L). The protection from metabolic syndrome in SFB-positive STOP/CD4 mice was also evident at 8 weeks ( Figures S3 I and S3J). Therefore, protection from DIO and metabolic syndrome in STOP/CD4 mice correlates with the presence of SFB-induced Th17 cells.
To confirm that protection is mediated by CD4 T cells, we depleted CD4 T cells in SFB/Th17-positive STOP/CD4 mice using anti-CD4 antibody ( Figure S3 K) and administered a HFD. Depletion of CD4 T cells did not affect SFB levels in HFD-fed STOP/CD4 mice ( Figure S3 L). However, protection from DIO and metabolic syndrome was lost in CD4 T cell-depleted STOP/CD4 mice ( Figures 2 M, 2N, and S3 M). We also crossed STOP/CD4 mice to TCRβ-KO animals to genetically delete αβ T cells. TCRβKO-STOP/CD4 animals became susceptible to DIO and metabolic syndrome ( Figures 2 O, 2P, and S3 N), despite maintenance of SFB ( Figure S3 O). Together, these experiments demonstrate that commensal Th17 cells are required for microbiota-mediated protection against DIO and metabolic syndrome.
To investigate whether Th17 cells are sufficient to bestow protection, we transferred WT CD4 T cells into SFB-colonized metabolic syndrome-susceptible STOP mice ( Figure S3 P). Transfer of CD4 T cells did not affect SFB levels ( Figure S3 Q). Transferred WT CD4 T cells differentiated into Th17 cells locally in the SI LP ( Figure S3 R; Goto et al., 2014 23. Goto, Y. ∙ Panea, C. ∙ Nakato, G. ... Segmented filamentous bacteria antigens presented by intestinal dendritic cells drive mucosal Th17 cell differentiation Immunity. 2014; 40 :594-607 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sano et al., 2015 58. Sano, T. ∙ Huang, W. ∙ Hall, J. ...

STOP mice adoptively transferred with CD4 T cells were significantly protected from DIO and metabolic syndrome compared to untreated animals ( Figures 2 Q and 2R). The foregoing studies suggest that gut microbiota can mediate protection from metabolic syndrome through induction of intestinal Th17 cells. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells appear to be both necessary and sufficient to provide protection and prevent or suppress development of obesity and pre-diabetic phenotypes.
Our results demonstrated that one of the pathogenic effects of HFD is the depletion of homeostatic commensal intestinal Th17 cells through elimination of Th17 cell-inducing microbiota. We hypothesized that recovery of intestinal Th17 cells by maintaining Th17 cell-inducing microbiota under HFD can improve DIO and metabolic disease. Therefore, we treated SFB-positive HFD-fed WT mice with SFB or control bacteria by oral gavage every other day for 4 weeks ( Figure 3 A). HFD-fed animals gavaged with control bacteria lost SFB ( Figure 3 B), which led to a decrease of intestinal Il17a transcripts ( Figure 3 C), due to a decrease of SI LP Th17 cells ( Figures 3 D and 3E). The animals also developed obesity and metabolic disease ( Figures 3 G–3L). SFB administration led to partial, but significant, recovery of SFB levels in fecal contents ( Figure 3 B). Importantly, SFB-treated animals had significant recovery of SI LP Th17 cells ( Figures 3 D and 3E) and IL-17 expression in terminal ileum ( Figure 3 C). Compared to controls, SFB-treated animals had significantly reduced weight gain under HFD ( Figures 3 G and 3H) and were protected from development of pre-diabetic phenotypes, including insulin resistance ( Figures 3 I and 3J) and glucose intolerance ( Figures 3 K and 3L). SFB-treated animals also showed amelioration of HFD-induced intestinal inflammation, including a decrease in inflammatory Th1 cells ( Figure 3 F), transcripts for inflammatory T cell cytokines, e.g., IFN-γ and TNF-α ( Figures S4 A and S4B), and transcripts for markers of tissue inflammation ( Figures S4 C and S4D). We conclude that a probiotic regimen of Th17 cell-inducing microbiota can significantly ameliorate DIO and metabolic syndrome by recalibrating intestinal T cell homeostasis.
Next, we investigated the nature of the dietary components that lead to loss of protective commensal intestinal Th17 cells. We used loss of SFB as a readout to identify dietary ingredients that deplete intestinal Th17 cells. Two of the better-characterized deleterious nutritional components of HFD are excess fat and low dietary fiber. However, neither removal of excess fat from our HFD formulation by using control purified low-fat diet (LFD) nor the addition of dietary fiber in the form of inulin improved SFB maintenance ( Figure 4 A). In contrast to less well-defined grain-based NCD, HFD is a purified diet that contains defined ingredients. Therefore, numerous nutritional components differ between the two formulations. We asked whether the loss of SFB is due to presence of an inhibitory activity or lack of a nutritional component in HFD, as compared to NCD. To answer this question, we provided mice with both diets simultaneously. We reasoned that if HFD contains an excess of an inhibitory component, then it should still inhibit SFB even in the presence of NCD. Alternatively, a missing nutritional component will be recovered by complementation with NCD. WT mice were colonized with SFB and then fed NCD, HFD, or a 50:50 mix of the two diets ( Figure 4 B). The addition of NCD nutritional components as a 50:50 NCD:HFD mix did not prevent SFB decrease ( Figure 4 B). This suggested that HFD contains an “inhibitory” component, prompting us to focus on the ingredients enriched in the HFD formulation. In addition to dietary fat, another ingredient highly represented in HFD is dietary sugar. Whereas NCD formulations contain 3%–6% sugar, HFD formulations contain 25% dietary sugars, including 10% sucrose and 15% maltodextrin. Sucrose and maltodextrin (a common ingredient in packaged foods, including candies and soft drinks) are thought to increase risk of metabolic syndrome, although the mechanisms remain controversial ( Bravo et al., 2013 8. Bravo, S. ∙ Lowndes, J. ∙ Sinnett, S. ...

Sugar-sweetened beverages, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease risk Circulation. 2010; 121 :1356-1364 Crossref Scopus (1269) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sugar levels in diet formulations inversely correlated with the diets’ effects on SFB levels ( Figure S5 A). Sucrose, provided ad libitum into the drinking water of NCD-fed WT animals, eliminated SFB in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4 C). 10% w/v sucrose or maltodextrin decreased SFB levels in feces and ileal mucosa of NCD-fed mice with similar kinetics to HFD-fed animals ( Figures 4 C, S5 B, and S5C). In contrast, 10% galactose did not significantly affect SFB levels ( Figure S5 C). Next, we examined the effects of sucrose on intestinal Th17 cells. Addition of sucrose to the water of NCD-fed animals decreased both RORγt + and IL-17 + Th17 cells in SI LP ( Figures 4 D and 4E), similarly to HFD (compare to Figure 1 ). As observed with HFD, the remaining Th17 cells in sucrose-fed animals had decreased levels of RORγ, suggesting perturbed functionality ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Other intestinal CD4 T cell subsets were not significantly affected by sucrose ( Figure S5 D–S5F). Examination of a published human personalized diet-microbiome dataset ( Johnson et al., 2019 32. Johnson, A.J. ∙ Vangay, P. ∙ Al-Ghalith, G.A. ... Daily Sampling Reveals Personalized Diet-Microbiome Associations in Humans Cell host & microbe. 2019; 25 :789-802.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed that increased sugar consumption was associated with decrease in the relative abundance of Th17 cell-inducing microbes in human volunteers ( Figure S5 G).
To investigate the role of dietary sugar on Th17 cell-mediated protection, we generated sugar-free HFD (SF-HFD) by replacing sucrose and maltodextrin in the HFD with starch. SF-HFD induced obesity and metabolic syndrome similarly to control HFD in SFB-negative animals ( Figures 4 H–4K and S5 H). In contrast, SFB-colonized SF-HFD-fed mice were protected from weight gain ( Figure 4 L), insulin resistance ( Figures 4 M and 4N), and glucose intolerance ( Figure S5 H). In contrast to HFD-fed mice, SFB-gavaged SF-HFD-fed animals maintained high levels of protective intestinal Th17 cells ( Figures 4 O). SFB-gavaged SF-HFD-fed animals also lacked evidence of intestinal and systemic inflammation and had low levels of inflammatory Th1 cells in SI LP ( Figure S5 I) and decreased levels of bacterial DNA and Tnfa transcripts in the liver ( Figures S5 J and S5K). Protection was also present at 9 weeks ( Figures S5 L and S5M).
To confirm that the positive effects of SF-HFD are due to absence of sugar and to control for other potential diet effects, we performed a separate set of experiments in which some SF-HFD animals received 10% sucrose in the drinking water. As before, SFB-colonized SF-HFD-fed animals maintained intestinal Th17 cells and were protected from DIO and metabolic syndrome ( Figures 4 P and 4Q). The protection afforded SF-HFD-fed mice, however, was entirely lost when sugar was added to their drinking water. The animals lost intestinal Th17 cells and were as susceptible as HFD-fed animals to obesity and metabolic syndrome ( Figures 4 P, 4Q, S5 N, and S5O).
To confirm that the protective effects of SF-HFD are mediated by Th17 cells, we examined RORγt-flox/CD4-Cre animals that specifically lack Th17 cell differentiation ( Choi et al., 2016 14. Choi, G.B. ∙ Yim, Y.S. ∙ Wong, H. ... The maternal interleukin-17a pathway in mice promotes autism-like phenotypes in offspring Science. 2016; 351 :933-939 Crossref Scopus (786) PubMed Google Scholar ). RORγt-flox/CD4-Cre and control littermates were colonized with SFB and fed SF-HFD. As expected, RORγt-flox/CD4-Cre animals lacked intestinal Th17 cells ( Figure S5 P). At the same time, protection from DIO and metabolic syndrome was lost in these animals compared with control WT littermates ( Figures 4 R and 4S). Compared to WT littermates, Th17 cell-deficient mice on SF-HFD showed increased weight gain ( Figure 4 R), insulin resistance ( Figure 4 S), glucose intolerance ( Figure S5 Q), and increased bacterial translocation and inflammatory markers in the liver ( Figure S5 R and S5S). Collectively, the foregoing data suggest that dietary sugar counteracts the protective effects of intestinal commensal Th17 cells in the context of DIO and metabolic syndrome by depleting these cells. They also show that elimination of dietary sugar is not sufficient to provide therapeutic benefit; protection also requires presence of commensal Th17 cells. Therefore, dietary interventions may need to be combined with immune therapies to achieve desired effects.
We next investigated the mechanism by which dietary sugar displaces SFB and metabolic syndrome-protective Th17 cells. Similarly to HFD, sugar did not decrease SFB in ILC3-deficient mice ( Figure S6 A), suggesting that sugar does not directly affect these Th17-inducing bacteria. To account for host effects, we treated SFB-monocolonized WT animals with 10% sucrose in the drinking water. In contrast to SPF mice ( Figure 4 C), dietary sugar did not affect SFB levels in monocolonized mice ( Figure 5 A). Therefore, displacement of SFB by sugar requires the presence of commensal microbes. To identify commensal species that mediate the effects of sugar, we compared microbiota composition of animals fed NCD, HFD, or NCD + 10% sucrose in the drinking water ( Figures 5 B–5F). HFD-fed and sugar-treated animals had distinct microbiota composition from that of NCD-fed animals but also significantly differed from each other ( Figure 5 B). This allowed us to narrow down microbiota differences between Th17-depleting (HFD and sugar) and Th17-supporting (NCD) diets. At the family level, Erysipelotrichaceae , Ruminococcaceae , and Lachnospiraceae were upregulated in both Th17-depleting diets ( Figure 5 C). Erysipelotrichaceae was by far the highest and most significantly enriched family in both HFD and sugar over the NCD ( Figure 5 C). Erysipelotrichaceae expansion has been reported in metabolic disorders, including DIO in mice ( Turnbaugh et al., 2008 65. Turnbaugh, P.J. ∙ Backhed, F. ∙ Fulton, L. ... Diet-induced obesity is linked to marked but reversible alterations in the mouse distal gut microbiome Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3 :213-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2323) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as in obese humans ( Zhang et al., 2009 80. Zhang, H. ∙ DiBaise, J.K. ∙ Zuccolo, A. ... Human gut microbiota in obesity and after gastric bypass Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106 :2365-2370 Crossref Scopus (1514) PubMed Google Scholar ). Erysipelotrichaceae expansion in our dataset contained several operational taxonomic units (OTU). However, one particular OTU, identified as Faecalibaculum rodentium ( Frod ), was consistently overrepresented in both HFD and sugar-treated animals ( Figures 5 D–5F). We confirmed expansion of Frod in HFD and sugar-treated mice by qPCR ( Figure 5 G). Comparison of SFB and Frod levels in individual animals identified strong inverse correlation between the two microbiota members ( Figure 5 H). Sugar-mediated Frod expansion was dose-dependent ( Figure S6 B) and was also present in other dietary treatments that eliminated SFB ( Figure S6 C) but not in dietary treatments that maintained SFB ( Figure S6 D). HFD-mediated expansion of Frod did not require SFB ( Figure S6 E). Moreover, it preceded the loss of SFB in SFB-positive animals ( Figure S6 F). We therefore hypothesized that Frod expansion may be responsible for the loss of SFB in SPF mice. In agreement with this hypothesis, neither sugar nor HFD increased Frod in ILC3-deficient mice, which maintain SFB ( Figure S6 G; data not shown). To investigate whether this is because of inability of Frod to colonize or expand in ILC3-deficient mice, we compared colonization kinetics following dietary intervention. For this, we first eliminated endogenous Frod by pre-treating WT and ILC3-deficient STOP/CD4 mice with ampicillin (Amp). We next introduced exogenous Frod by oral gavage and followed colonization kinetics. To examine Frod, expansion animals were also given 10% sucrose in the drinking water ( Figure 5 I). Shortly after Frod gavage (day 2), both WT and STOP/CD4 mice showed similarly high levels of Frod in feces ( Figures 5 J and 5K), suggesting that Frod is capable of colonizing ILC3-deficient animals. Sugar in the drinking water led to a robust expansion of Frod in WT mice by day 10 ( Figure 5 J). In contrast, Frod was almost undetectable at day 10 in sugar-treated STOP/CD4 mice ( Figure 5 K). The foregoing results demonstrate that sugar-mediated expansion of Frod requires ILC3.
The above results strongly suggest that sugar or HFD-mediated expansion of Frod is responsible for the loss of SFB. Therefore, we used gnotobiotic animals to directly test whether Frod is sufficient to outcompete or displace SFB. We first attempted to colonize germ-free (GF) mice with SFB and Frod by gavaging both bacteria at the same time ( Figure 6 A). SFB colonized GF animals to high levels when provided alone ( Figure 6 B). In contrast, SFB levels were 100-fold lower when SFB and Frod were gavaged together ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Addition of sugar to the drinking water of SFB/ Frod dually colonized animals led to expansion of Frod and even further decrease in SFB levels ( Figures 6 D–6F). We also asked whether Frod can displace pre-existing SFB. GF animals were first colonized with SFB and later colonized with Frod or control bacteria ( Figures 6 G and S6 H). All animals were similarly colonized with SFB prior to the introduction of Frod ( Figures 6 H and S6 I). However, SFB quickly disappeared after introduction of Frod ( Figures 6 H and 6I) but not after introduction of control bacteria ( Figure S6 I–S6K). In accordance with the loss of SFB, Frod colonization was also accompanied by a decrease of SFB-induced intestinal Th17 cells ( Figures S6 L–S6O). 24 h after Frod gavage, SFB and Frod were present together in gnotobiotic animals and occupied the same geographical niche in the mucus of terminal ileum close to epithelial cells and also in close proximity to each other ( Figures 6 J and 6K). These findings suggest that dietary sugar expands members of the Erysipelotrichaceae family, and specifically Frod , in an ILC3-dependent manner, which in turn can displace SFB and decrease protective intestinal Th17 cells.
We next investigated the mechanism by which commensal Th17 cells provide protection from metabolic syndrome. IL-17 has strong effects on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and maintains barrier integrity ( Hueber et al., 2012 28. Hueber, W. ∙ Sands, B.E. ∙ Lewitzky, S. ... Secukinumab, a human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody, for moderate to severe Crohn's disease: unexpected results of a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial Gut. 2012; 61 :1693-1700 Crossref Scopus (1248) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2015 43.

Immunol. 2009; 10 :603-609 Crossref Scopus (662) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the gut, epithelial absorption of dietary lipids is a known regulator of metabolic syndrome ( Petersen et al., 2019 56. Petersen, C. ∙ Bell, R. ∙ Klag, K.A. ... T cell-mediated regulation of the microbiota protects against obesity Science. 2019; 365 :eaat9351 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2017 72. Wang, Y. ∙ Kuang, Z. ∙ Yu, X. ... The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL3 and the circadian clock Science. 2017; 357 :912-916 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore examined the effects of commensal Th17 cells on intestinal lipid absorption. We compared lipid concentrations in various tissues in HFD-fed Th17-deficient STOP mice that develop metabolic syndrome and Th17-sufficient STOP/CD4 mice in which Th17 cells protect from metabolic syndrome. STOP/CD4 mice had significantly decreased lipid content in IECs and liver ( Figures 7 A and 7B) but increased lipid levels in feces ( Figure 7 C). This suggested that lipid absorption in IEC is reduced in the presence of Th17 cells, with concomitant accumulation of lipid in the gut lumen. Indeed, expression of several genes involved in lipid uptake and transport were downregulated in IEC of STOP/CD4 mice ( Figures 7 D and S7 A–S7D), most notably Cd36 , encoding a transporter of dietary fatty acids into cells ( Silverstein and Febbraio, 2009 60. Silverstein, R.L. ∙ Febbraio, M. CD36, a scavenger receptor involved in immunity, metabolism, angiogenesis, and behavior Sci. Signal. 2009; 2 :re3 Crossref Scopus (860) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 7 D and S7 E). Downregulation of CD36 in STOP/CD4 IEC required T cells insofar as it was not observed in IEC from HFD-fed αβ T cell-deficient STOP/CD4 mice ( Figure 7 E). Moreover, CD36 downregulation was not mediated by IL-22 because both strains lack ILC3, and we did not detect a difference in IL-22 production from CD4 T cells ( Figure S7 F) or in expression of IL-22 controlled genes in intestinal epithelium ( Figure S7 G; data not shown).
Epithelial CD36 has potent effects on dietary lipid absorption, thereby regulating metabolic syndrome ( Nauli et al., 2006 50. Nauli, A.M. ∙ Nassir, F. ∙ Zheng, S. ... CD36 is important for chylomicron formation and secretion and may mediate cholesterol uptake in the proximal intestine Gastroenterology. 2006; 131 :1197-1207 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ; Petersen et al., 2019 56. Petersen, C. ∙ Bell, R. ∙ Klag, K.A. ... T cell-mediated regulation of the microbiota protects against obesity Science. 2019; 365 :eaat9351 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2017 72. Wang, Y. ∙ Kuang, Z. ∙ Yu, X. ... The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL3 and the circadian clock Science. 2017; 357 :912-916 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD36 is highly expressed in the duodenum, where lipid breakdown occurs, as well as the jejunum, where most lipid absorption occurs, and its expression is lower in ileum at steady state ( Chen et al., 2001 12. Chen, M. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Braunstein, E. ... Gut expression and regulation of FAT/CD36: possible role in fatty acid transport in rat enterocytes Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 281 :E916-E923 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 F–7H). We found that SFB colonization specifically downregulates CD36 gene expression in the distal SI (jejunum and ileum) but not in the duodenum ( Figure 7 F–7H). CD36 downregulation was dependent on Th17 cell-derived IL-17 because it was not observed in Th17-deficient RORγt-flox/CD4-Cre mice ( Figures 7 F–7H), IL-17A-deficient mice ( Figures 7 I and S7 H–S7J), or WT animals treated with neutralizing anti-IL-17A antibody ( Figure 7 J). Thus, commensal Th17 cells can decrease lipid absorption in distal SI by decreasing lipid uptake through CD36 in an IL-17-dependent manner. To investigate whether IL-17 acts directly on the IEC, we examined the effects of IL-17 on CD36 expression in SI enteroids in data from two independent published datasets. Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from ( Kumar et al., 2016 39. Kumar, P. ∙ Monin, L. ∙ Castillo, P. ... Intestinal Interleukin-17 Receptor Signaling Mediates Reciprocal Control of the Gut Microbiota and Autoimmune Inflammation Immunity. 2016; 44 :659-671 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed significant decrease of CD36 expression in terminal ileum enteroids treated with IL-17 in vitro ( Figure 7 K). Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from total SI enteroids from Biton et al. (2018) 7. Biton, M. ∙ Haber, A.L. ∙ Rogel, N. ... T Helper Cell Cytokines Modulate Intestinal Stem Cell Renewal and Differentiation Cell. 2018; 175 :1307-1320.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar showed a similar decrease of CD36 in SI enterocytes treated with IL-17 in vitro ( Figures S7 K and S7L), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Together, these data suggest that Th17 cell-derived IL-17 can directly suppress CD36 expression in SI enterocytes.
At steady state, lipid absorption predominantly occurs in the jejunum; however, during DIO and in HFD-fed animals, excess lipids carry over into the distal gut ( Figure S7 M) and are taken up in the ileum ( Buttet et al., 2016 9. Buttet, M. ∙ Poirier, H. ∙ Traynard, V. ... Deregulated Lipid Sensing by Intestinal CD36 in Diet-Induced Hyperinsulinemic Obese Mouse Model PLoS One. 2016; 11 :e0145626 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; de Wit et al., 2012 16. de Wit, N. ∙ Derrien, M. ∙ Bosch-Vermeulen, H. ... Saturated fat stimulates obesity and hepatic steatosis and affects gut microbiota composition by an enhanced overflow of dietary fat to the distal intestine Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2012; 303 :G589-G599 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that HFD specifically and potently upregulates CD36 expression in the terminal ileum (and to lesser extent in the jejunum) ( Figure S7 N). We hypothesized that sugar-sensitive commensal Th17 cells can protect by counteracting the upregulation of CD36. Indeed, both HFD and SF-HFD induced similar upregulation of CD36 in the ileum and jejunum IEC in absence of SFB-specific Th17 cells ( Figure 7 L). However, this upregulation was significantly suppressed in the presence of commensal Th17 cells in SF-HFD-fed animals ( Figures 7 L and S7 O).
To directly address whether the protective effects of Th17 cells require CD36, we fed SFB-negative and SFB-colonized WT and CD36-deficient animals SF-HFD. As earlier, SFB-induced Th17 cells provided protection from SF-HFD-induced metabolic syndrome in WT animals ( Figure 7 M–7Q). CD36-deficient animals developed significantly less metabolic syndrome compared to WT animals, as previously reported ( Figures 7 M–7Q). However, in contrast to WT animals, SFB Th17 cells did not provide additional protection in the absence of CD36 ( Figures 7 M–7Q). The foregoing findings suggest that commensal Th17 cell-derived IL-17 decreases lipid uptake and absorption specifically in the distal SI during DIO by controlling epithelial expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36.

Section: Discussion

Microbiota and intestinal immunity regulate obesity and metabolic syndrome. Inflammatory changes in the intestine precede liver and adipose tissue inflammation, which drive pathology in metabolic diseases such as metabolic syndrome and T2D ( Tilg et al., 2020 64.

The Intestinal Immune System in Obesity and Insulin Resistance Cell Metab. 2016; 23 :413-426 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ). Imbalance of intestinal immune homeostasis is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of these systemic conditions ( Kawano et al., 2016 34. Kawano, Y. ∙ Nakae, J. ∙ Watanabe, N. ...

Regulation of obesity-related insulin resistance with gut anti-inflammatory agents Cell Metab. 2015; 21 :527-542 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we provide evidence that microbiota-regulated intestinal immunity can also provide protection and should therefore be considered critical therapeutic target in metabolic syndrome and T2D.
The role of type 3 immunity in DIO and metabolic syndrome is complex. Pro-inflammatory Th17 cells are enriched in liver and adipose tissue of obese patients ( Dalmas et al., 2014 15.

At the same time, intestinal Th17 cells have been proposed to provide protection ( Garidou et al., 2015 21. Garidou, L. ∙ Pomie, C. ∙ Klopp, P. ...

Similarly, ILC3 and ILC3-derived IL-22 are considered guardians of the epithelial barrier and beneficial in metabolic syndrome ( Wang et al., 2014 71. Wang, X. ∙ Ota, N. ∙ Manzanillo, P. ... Interleukin-22 alleviates metabolic disorders and restores mucosal immunity in diabetes Nature. 2014; 514 :237-241 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zou et al., 2018 82.

However, ILC3-derived IL-22 can also contribute to metabolic disease ( Sasaki et al., 2019 59. Sasaki, T. ∙ Moro, K. ∙ Kubota, T. ... Innate Lymphoid Cells in the Induction of Obesity Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :202-217.e7 e207 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Upadhyay et al., 2012 68. Upadhyay, V. ∙ Poroyko, V. ∙ Kim, T.J. ... Lymphotoxin regulates commensal responses to enable diet-induced obesity Nat.

The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL3 and the circadian clock Science. 2017; 357 :912-916 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results help reconcile these seemingly contradicting reports and suggest that the role of ILC3 is context dependent. Using an ILC3-deficient model that allows for differentiation of Th17 cells, we find that ILC3 provide protection from metabolic disease in the absence of SFB and SFB Th17 cells. This protection was relatively mild at the 4-week timepoint we examined but could be more significant long-term. We also show that maintenance of commensal Th17 cells in ILC3-deficient mice confers lasting protection. Moreover, ILC3 function, likely through IL-22 production, was required for sugar-mediated expansion of Frod and consequent loss of SFB and protective Th17 cells. Therefore, ILC3 can counteract the protective role of Th17 cells and, in such context, contribute to the pathogenic effects of HFD. Thus, the effects of ILC3, and by extension IL-22, on complex phenotypes, such as metabolic syndrome, are dependent on microbiota composition and the presence of Th17 cells, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting experimental results or designing cytokine-based therapies.
We demonstrate that commensal microbiota can protect from metabolic syndrome through modulation of intestinal T cell homeostasis. Our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting intestinal Th17 cells protect from metabolic syndrome ( Garidou et al., 2015 21. Garidou, L. ∙ Pomie, C. ∙ Klopp, P. ... The gut microbiota regulates intestinal CD4 T cells expressing RORγt and controls metabolic disease Cell Metab. 2015; 22 :100-112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hong et al., 2017 27.

Gut-Specific Delivery of T-Helper 17 Cells Reduces Obesity and Insulin Resistance in Mice Gastroenterology. 2017; 152 :1998-2010 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we demonstrate that protective Th17 cells are commensal-specific and are depleted during DIO by diet-induced depletion of Th17-inducing microbiota. We also identify sucrose as a dietary component that is sufficient to deplete Th17-inducing bacteria and Th17 cells. Dietary sugar is considered detrimental for metabolic disease; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood ( Macdonald, 2016 47. Macdonald, I.A. A review of recent evidence relating to sugars, insulin resistance and diabetes Eur. J. Nutr. 2016; 55 :17-23 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stanhope, 2016 61. Stanhope, K.L. Sugar consumption, metabolic disease and obesity: The state of the controversy Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab Sci. 2016; 53 :52-67 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we propose a conceptually distinct mechanism in which sucrose does not directly drive metabolic syndrome but counteracts the protective function of intestinal immune cells by modulating intestinal microbiota. Sucrose and fructose intake have been associated with increase in intestinal inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease ( Laffin et al., 2019 41. Laffin, M. ∙ Fedorak, R. ∙ Zalasky, A. ... A high-sugar diet rapidly enhances susceptibility to colitis via depletion of luminal short-chain fatty acids in mice Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :12294 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ; Racine et al., 2016 57. Racine, A. ∙ Carbonnel, F. ∙ Chan, S.S.M. ... Dietary Patterns and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Europe: Results from the EPIC Study Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2016; 22 :345-354 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results suggest that dietary sugar can increase the inflammatory tone of the intestine indirectly by depleting intestinal microbes that maintain tissue homeostasis. Elimination of sugar from HFD protected mice from disease by preserving commensal Th17 cells. Importantly, SF-HFD exerted protection only in the presence of Th17 cell-inducing microbiota and provided no benefit in the absence of commensal Th17 cells. Therefore, dietary interventions may only provide benefit if appropriate microbiota-regulated immune mechanisms are also in place. It is expected that individual variations in such mechanisms will affect the success of diet-based therapies and should be taken into consideration.
We find that dietary sugar depletes SFB indirectly by expanding other gut bacteria. We identify Faecalibaculum rodentium as one such microbe and show that it is sufficient to displace SFB and decrease SFB-induced Th17 cells. Frod colonizes the mucosal surface of ileum and colon ( Zagato et al., 2020 79. Zagato, E. ∙ Pozzi, C. ∙ Bertocchi, A. ... Endogenous murine microbiota member Faecalibaculum rodentium and its human homologue protect from intestinal tumour growth Nat Microbiol. 2020; 5 :511-524 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ) and as we report here can be found in close proximity to SFB in gnotobiotic animals, suggesting that displacement could be mediated by direct interactions between the two species. This is also supported by the fact that in our colony, Frod is present in low abundance in NCD-fed SPF mice without displacing SFB. SFB displacement required expansion of Frod by sugar or relatively large amounts of Frod in gnotobiotic animals, which suggests that an abundance threshold is required for Frod to displace SFB. The mechanisms by which Frod inhibits SFB will be important to investigate in the future. An equally important question is whether other microbes have similar effects. We consider it likely that other commensals can also negatively affect Th17 cell-inducing microbiota. Our results demonstrate that dietary effects on immunoregulatory microbes can be mediated by microbe-microbe interactions.
Dietary lipids are major drivers of the inflammatory effects of HFD, including barrier leakage, endotoxemia, and type 1 inflammation ( Basson et al., 2020 6. Basson, A.R. ∙ Chen, C. ∙ Sagl, F. ... Regulation of Intestinal Inflammation by Dietary Fats Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :604989 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khan et al., 2021 36. Khan, S. ∙ Luck, H. ∙ Winer, S. ...

However, the detailed mechanisms involved and the relative contribution of these mechanisms to metabolic disease are not currently known. We find that commensal Th17 cells can decrease lipid absorption, and this will likely affect inflammatory phenotypes in the intestine and adipose tissue. Indeed, in most of our experiments, the presence of commensal Th17 cells was accompanied by decrease in Th1 intestinal responses and bacterial translocation. Decrease in Th1 inflammation, including intestinal Th1 inflammation, improves obesity related metabolic phenotypes ( Luck et al., 2015 45. Luck, H. ∙ Tsai, S. ∙ Chung, J. ...

Deficiency in interferon-gamma results in reduced body weight and better glucose tolerance in mice Endocrinology. 2011; 152 :3690-3699 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ) and can contribute to the protective function of commensal Th17 cells. At the same time, commensal Th17 cells may also influence low-grade inflammation independently of lipid absorption, for example by controlling local intestinal inflammation. Indeed, SFB-induced Th17 cells differ significantly from pathogen-induced inflammatory Th17 cells and may participate in maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis ( Khan et al., 2021 36. Khan, S. ∙ Luck, H. ∙ Winer, S. ... Emerging concepts in intestinal immune control of obesity-related metabolic disease Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :2598 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Omenetti et al., 2019 52. Omenetti, S. ∙ Bussi, C. ∙ Metidji, A. ...

Therefore, commensal Th17 cells may possess additional mechanisms of protection from metabolic disease.
CD36 is a critical regulator of lipid absorption and fat metabolism and CD36 deficiency is associated with resistance to obesity and metabolic syndrome ( Cai et al., 2012 10. Cai, L. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Ji, A. ...

Chem. 2018; 293 :13338-13348 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microbiota can promote host lipid absorption by enhancing epithelial CD36 ( Wang et al., 2017 72. Wang, Y. ∙ Kuang, Z. ∙ Yu, X. ... The intestinal microbiota regulates body composition through NFIL3 and the circadian clock Science. 2017; 357 :912-916 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microbiota can also restrain lipid absorption and prevent obesity by decreasing intestinal epithelial CD36 ( Petersen et al., 2019 56. Petersen, C. ∙ Bell, R. ∙ Klag, K.A. ... T cell-mediated regulation of the microbiota protects against obesity Science. 2019; 365 :eaat9351 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). We find that commensal Th17 cells protect from DIO and metabolic syndrome by decreasing IEC expression of CD36 and intestinal lipid absorption in an IL-17-dependent manner. CD36 is expressed on multiple cell types and has pleiotropic roles in metabolic disease ( Chen et al., 2022 13. Chen, Y. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Cui, W. ...

Structure-function of CD36 and importance of fatty acid signal transduction in fat metabolism Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2014; 34 :281-303 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether Th17 cell mediated regulation of CD36 can protect through additional mechanisms requires further study.
Our work describes an intricate network of interactions between dietary components, microbiota, and intestinal immune cells that regulates metabolic conditions such as DIO, metabolic syndrome, and T2D. Our findings also suggest that the effects of dietary and immune interventions on metabolic conditions are not universal. Future precision medicine therapeutic approaches should take into account individual variations of immunomodulatory microbiota.
Our study was limited to early stages of DIO and changes in intestinal environment. Adipose tissue inflammation was not evident at the early time points we examined; however, the protective effects of commensal Th17 cells were further re-enforced at 9 weeks and are, therefore, long-lasting. Nevertheless, the long-term effects and mechanisms of Th17 cell protection in systemic disease will be important to examine in the future. Also, although we demonstrate clear role for sugar and Faecalibacilum rodentium in opposing commensal Th17 cells, other dietary and microbiota components may have similar effects. Finally, our study was limited to animal models. We find that reported Th17-inducing microbes are also negatively affected by metabolic disease and sugar consumption in adult humans. Whether these, or other, microbes can induce intestinal Th17 cells with protective functions in metabolic disease in human patients will be important to investigate.

Mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories and bred (except for Cd36 −/− mice) at Columbia University. Animals were purchased only from SFB-negative maximum barrier rooms at Jackson. All animals were tested for SFB upon arrival and maintained in an SFB-negative high barrier room at Columbia University. 7B8 mice were bred to CD45.1 and IL-17-GFP mice at Columbia University to generate 7B8.CD45.1.IL-17-GFP animals. RORγ−STOP mice were generated by homologous recombination in C57BL/6 ES cells. The targeting vector generated an inversion of the Rorc genomic sequence containing Exons 3–6 surrounded by two pairs of LoxP and LoxP 2272 sequences in opposite orientation in intron 2 and intron 6 ( Figure S2 ). To generate ILC3-deficient mice that can generate CD4 T cells and Th17 cells, RORγ−STOP mice were crossed to Cd4-Cre mice. All mice were bred and housed under high-barrier specific pathogen-free conditions at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Except for Cd36 −/− , all other lines were bred to heterozygocity and experiments were performed with littermate controls. Whenever possible all genotypes were housed in the same cage to control for microbiota and cage effects. Cd36 −/− animals were ordered from the Jackson Laboratories with age and sex-matched C57BL/6J controls from the same room at Jackson and co-housed for two weeks prior to the start of the experiment and for the duration of the experiment to control for microbiota differences. Germ-free C57BL/6 mice were generated at the gnotobiotic facilities at Rockefeller University, Weill Cornell or Keio University and following defined flora colonization were housed in Techniplast isocages at the same institution. Metabolic experiments used 5-week-old males.
All diets were irradiated for sterility. Diets were provided in pellet form ad libitum and fresh diet provided twice a week. For 50:50 NCD:HFD mix, pellets from individual diets were mechanically disrupted into fine powder. 30 mg powder from each diet were mixed manually with 5–10 mL of autoclaved water to form a palatable pellet. The pellets were dried for 30 min and provided ad libitum to the animals on a clean plastic plate inside the cage. Fresh mixed diet pellets were provided twice weekly. Individual diet formulations are listed in Table S1 .
5-week-old males were colonized with SFB on Day −14 and kept on NCD. SFB colonization was confirmed on Day −10 and Day −1. On Day 0 the animals were switched to corresponding diets. Body weight was followed every 3–4 days throughout the experiment. Insulin tolerance test was performed on Day 28. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed on Day 32. Tissue and cell isolation for flow cytometry or quantitative RT-PCR was performed on Day 35. For insulin tolerance test, animals were subjected to a 6-h fast (8AM-2PM), followed by intraperitoneal insulin injection (0.75 U/kg, human insulin). Blood samples were obtained at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 120 min. For glucose tolerance test, animals were subjected to an overnight fast (6PM-6AM) followed by oral glucose gavage (1.2 g/kg of 12% dextrose solution). 2μL blood samples were obtained at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min.
To deplete CD4 T cells in vivo , animals were injected intraperitoneally with an anti-CD4 antibody or isotype control twice weekly starting on Day 0. To neutralize IL-17A, 300 ug/mouse of an IL-17A neutralizing antibody or IgG1 isotype control were injected intraperitoneally every other day.
For adoptive transfer experiments, 0.5 million CD4 T cells (95%–98% purity) were MACS-purified from spleens and lymph nodes of SFB-negative 7B8/CD45.1/IL-17A-GFP reporter mice, labeled with Cell Trace Violet proliferation dye (Life Technologies) and transferred intravenously into congenic CD45.2 WT mice fed with corresponding diets. Priming and IL-17A induction in SI LP were investigated 7 days after transfer. For CD4 T cell reconstitution experiments, 5–10 million MACS purified CD4 T cells from spleens and LNs of SFB-negative WT/CD45.1/IL-17A-GFP reporter mice were transferred into recipient congenic STOP/CD45.2 mice.
RNA was isolated from tissues after homogenization in Trizol using manufacturer’s protocol. After cDNA synthesis, Q-PCR was performed on LightCycler 480 (Roche) using SYBR Green. Individual parts of the intestine were prepared as follows. Duodenum was dissected macroscopically. The remaining small intestine was divided into four equal parts and the parts were defined as proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, proximal ileum and distal ileum. For RNA isolation 0.5 cm tissue was collected from the center of the pieces defined as duodenum (Duo), distal jejunum (Jej) and distal ileum (Ile). Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were collected from the corresponding part of the small intestine by thorough washing of mucus with PBS followed by gentle scraping of the luminal surface with a glass slide.
LP lymphocytes isolation and intracellular cytokine and transcription factor staining were performed as described previously ( Goto et al., 2014 23. Goto, Y. ∙ Panea, C. ∙ Nakato, G. ... Segmented filamentous bacteria antigens presented by intestinal dendritic cells drive mucosal Th17 cell differentiation Immunity. 2014; 40 :594-607 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Both flaps of epididymal fat were dissected and cut into small pieces. The sample was digested for 45 min at 37 °C with 2 mg/mL typeⅠ collagenase and 1.5% FCS in RPMI.
Neutral lipids were extracted using published protocol ( Kraus et al., 2015 38. Kraus, D. ∙ Yang, Q. ∙ Kahn, B. Lipid Extraction from Mouse Feces Bio-Protoc. 2015; 5 :e1375 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and measured with a commercial lipid quantification kit (see Key Resources Table ).
To examine if IL-17A acts on epithelial cells, previously reported RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse ileum enteroids ( Kumar et al., 2016 39. Kumar, P. ∙ Monin, L. ∙ Castillo, P. ... Intestinal Interleukin-17 Receptor Signaling Mediates Reciprocal Control of the Gut Microbiota and Autoimmune Inflammation Immunity. 2016; 44 :659-671 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of total small intestine organoids ( Biton et al., 2018 7. Biton, M. ∙ Haber, A.L. ∙ Rogel, N. ... T Helper Cell Cytokines Modulate Intestinal Stem Cell Renewal and Differentiation Cell. 2018; 175 :1307-1320.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ) treated in vitro with rIL-17A or control were downloaded from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). For bulk RNA-seq, single-ended raw reads were processed by Cutadapt v2.1 (reference) with following parameters “--minimum-length 24 -u 10 --trim-n -q 15” to remove low-quality bases and Illumina adapters. Reads passing quality filtering were then aligned against mouse cDNA reference GRCm38 by Bowtie2 v2.3.4 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 42. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ) in --very-sensitive mode and reads counts per gene were then normalized by gene length and sequencing depth, i.e., reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM), for expression level quantification. For scRNAseq, raw reads were processed by 10X Genomics Cellranger toolkit v1.0.1 according to the original paper. Next, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes were excluded, and remaining cells were subjected to UMAP ordination and clustering following standard Seurat pipeline ( Hao et al., 2021 25. Hao, Y. ∙ Hao, S. ∙ Andersen-Nissen, E. ... Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data Cell. 2021; 184 :3573-3587.e29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4942) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cell types were manually identified by top cluster markers and gene expression level was calculated by function “AverageExpression” implemented in Seurat package.
SFB were obtained from feces of SFB-monocolonized mice housed at Keio University. Faecalibaculum rodentium (Frod) (PB1) and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (Bpl) (1B11) were isolated in the Kenya Honda laboratory (RIKEN IMS) as previously described ( Atarashi et al., 2015 4. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Ando, M. ... Th17 Cell Induction by Adhesion of Microbes to Intestinal Epithelial Cells Cell. 2015; 163 :367-380 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (803) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zagato et al., 2020 79. Zagato, E. ∙ Pozzi, C. ∙ Bertocchi, A. ... Endogenous murine microbiota member Faecalibaculum rodentium and its human homologue protect from intestinal tumour growth Nat Microbiol. 2020; 5 :511-524 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). B. pseudolongum was chosen as a control strain for Frod gnotobiotic experiments, because it is a relatively high abundance species in our mouse colony that further increased after treatment with sucrose, but not with HFD. Frod and Bpl cultures were grown in pre-reduced Eggerth-Gagnon (EG) medium ( Frod ) or Reinforced Clostridial Medium (Fisher DF1808-17-3) ( Bpl ) in an anaerobic chamber (5% H 2 , 10% CO 2 , 85% N 2 ) at 37C for 48 h. For Frod colonization, mice were gavaged with 200 μL of overnight culture resuspended in pre-reduced PBS (optical density (OD) 600 ≅ 0.6; corresponding to about 5 × 10 7 cfu/mL. For colonization of SPF mice, WT or STOP/CD4 recipient animals were pre-treated with 1 g/L ampicillin in the drinking water for four days. For Bpl colonization, animals received 1 × 10 8 cfu/mL of 1B11 in 200 μL pre-reduced PBS by oral gavage.
Unless otherwise noted, SFB colonization was performed 2 weeks prior to diet change by single oral gavage of fecal suspension from SFB-enriched mice as previously described ( Farkas et al., 2015 19. Farkas, A.M. ∙ Panea, C. ∙ Goto, Y. ... Induction of Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria in the murine intestine J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 421 :104-111 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). For SFB probiotic treatment, animals were gavaged every other day. Control animals were gavaged with fecal suspensions from SFB-negative littermate controls. To control for variability in SFB levels in feces used for gavage, all gavages were performed with frozen stocks from a single batch of SFB-enriched feces. To generate SFB-enriched feces a single cohort of 10 adult SFB-negative maximum barrier NSG mice from The Jackson Laboratory were colonized with feces from SFB-monocolonized mice. Fecal samples were obtained in the period of 8 weeks, tested for SFB by quantitative RT-PCR and frozen as batch aliquots at −80C. Control SFB-negative feces were collected from a separate cohort of littermate NSG mice housed in a similar manner. SFB colonization levels were confirmed by qPCR and normalized to levels of total bacteria (UNI) as previously described ( Farkas et al., 2015 19. Farkas, A.M. ∙ Panea, C. ∙ Goto, Y. ... Induction of Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria in the murine intestine J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 421 :104-111 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Absolute levels of SFB, Faecalibaculum rodentium ( Frod ) and B. pseudolongum (Bpl) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and quantified as μg of DNA per gram feces using standard curves from mono-colonized mice (SFB) or in vitro culture ( Frod, Bpl ).
Genomic DNA from feces was extracted using a silica bead beating-based protocol as previously described ( Farkas et al., 2015 19. Farkas, A.M. ∙ Panea, C. ∙ Goto, Y. ... Induction of Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria in the murine intestine J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 421 :104-111 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). 16S sequencing of the V4 region was performed utilizing a custom dual-indexing protocol, detailed fully in ( Ji et al., 2019 31. Ji, B.W. ∙ Sheth, R.U. ∙ Dixit, P.D. ... Quantifying spatiotemporal variability and noise in absolute microbiota abundances using replicate sampling Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :731-736 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Raw sequencing reads of 16S-V4 amplicons were analyzed by USEARCH v11.0.667 ( Edgar, 2010 17. Edgar, R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2460-2461 Crossref Scopus (15874) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, paired-end reads were merged using “-fastq_mergepairs” mode with default setting. Merged reads were then subjected to quality filtering using “-fastq_filter” mode with the option “-fastq_maxee 1.0 -fastq_minlen 240”. Remaining reads were deduplicated (-fastx_uniques) and clustered into OTUs (-unoise3) at 100% identity, and merged reads were then searched against OTU sequences (-otutab) to generate OTU count table. Taxonomy of OTUs were assigned using RDP classifier trained with 16S rRNA training set 18 ( Wang et al., 2007 70. Wang, Q. ∙ Garrity, G.M. ∙ Tiedje, J.M. ... Naive Bayesian classifier for rapid assignment of rRNA sequences into the new bacterial taxonomy Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73 :5261-5267 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sample total bacterial loads were calculated based on reads ratio of spike-in strain and sample weight, and relative abundance profiles of other taxa were then scaled by bacterial load to obtain absolute OTU abundances in arbitrary units, detailed fully in ( Ji et al., 2019 31. Ji, B.W. ∙ Sheth, R.U. ∙ Dixit, P.D. ... Quantifying spatiotemporal variability and noise in absolute microbiota abundances using replicate sampling Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :731-736 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To examine if Th17-inducing gut microbiota were altered under different conditions, two previously reported metagenome datasets from feces (metabolic syndrome versus healthy controls ( Pedersen et al., 2016 53. Pedersen, H.K. ∙ Gudmundsdottir, V. ∙ Nielsen, H.B. ... Human gut microbes impact host serum metabolome and insulin sensitivity Nature. 2016; 535 :376-381 Crossref Scopus (1437) PubMed Google Scholar ) and healthy individuals with recorded diet ( Johnson et al., 2019 32. Johnson, A.J. ∙ Vangay, P. ∙ Al-Ghalith, G.A. ... Daily Sampling Reveals Personalized Diet-Microbiome Associations in Humans Cell host & microbe. 2019; 25 :789-802.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar )) were downloaded from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Reference genomes of 20 Th17-inducing gut strains ( Atarashi et al., 2015 4. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Ando, M. ... Th17 Cell Induction by Adhesion of Microbes to Intestinal Epithelial Cells Cell. 2015; 163 :367-380 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (803) PubMed Google Scholar ) were accessed according to the original paper and reference genomes of B. adolescentis and E. lenta were downloaded from NCBI Genome under accession NZ_CP028341.1 and NZ_CP089331.1. Reads of each sample were processed by Cutadapt v2.1 ( Martin, 2011 49. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnetjournal. 2011; 17 :10 Crossref Google Scholar ) with following parameters “--minimum-length 24:24 -u 5 -U 5 -q 20 --pair-filter = any” to remove low-quality bases and Nextera adapters. Reads passing quality filtering were then aligned against reference genomes by Bowtie2 v2.3.4 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 42. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ) in --very-sensitive mode and relative abundances of each strain were calculated as # of reads mapped to the strain normalized by total reads count. For the dataset of metabolic syndrome versus healthy control, 295 non-diabetic individuals were classified into “with metabolic syndrome” and “without metabolic syndrome” according to individual annotations in the original paper ( Pedersen et al., 2016 53. Pedersen, H.K. ∙ Gudmundsdottir, V. ∙ Nielsen, H.B. ... Human gut microbes impact host serum metabolome and insulin sensitivity Nature. 2016; 535 :376-381 Crossref Scopus (1437) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the community of 20 Th17-inducing strains, high depletion was defined as more than 12 strains showing less than 25 th percentile relative abundance across all individuals. For the dataset of recorded diet, index of “L2: sugar and sweets” in dietary records were extracted from the original paper ( Johnson et al., 2019 32. Johnson, A.J. ∙ Vangay, P. ∙ Al-Ghalith, G.A. ... Daily Sampling Reveals Personalized Diet-Microbiome Associations in Humans Cell host & microbe. 2019; 25 :789-802.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 509 samples from 34 individuals with accessible shotgun metagenome data were classified into high and low “Sugar and sweets consumption” using threshold of 25 for “L2: sugar and sweets” index.
SFB-monocolonized mice were inoculated with Frod and samples from the terminal ileum were extracted after 24 h and processed for electron microscopy as previously described ( Ladinsky et al., 2019 40. Ladinsky, M.S. ∙ Araujo, L.P. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Endocytosis of commensal antigens by intestinal epithelial cells regulates mucosal T cell homeostasis Science. 2019; 363 :eaat4042 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Semi-thin (170 nm) sections were cut with a UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and imaged on a Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) at 120k eV.
Unless otherwise noted, statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA for panels where more than three groups are being compared, and unpaired t test with Welch’s correction for panels where two groups are compared. p values are represented on figures as follows: ns, not significant, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.005, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0005. On time course panels, p values with a bracket line connecting two curves refer to the whole curves and p values on top of individual datapoints refer only to those individual datapoints. Error bars on all figures represent standard deviation of the mean. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software).
