Title: Origins and Proliferative States of Human Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells


Abstract: Summary

Human cerebral cortex size and complexity has increased greatly during evolution. While increased progenitor diversity and enhanced proliferative potential play important roles in human neurogenesis and gray matter expansion, the mechanisms of human oligodendrogenesis and white matter expansion remain largely unknown. Here, we identify EGFR-expressing “Pre-OPCs” that originate from outer radial glial cells (oRGs) and undergo mitotic somal translocation (MST) during division. oRG-derived Pre-OPCs provide an additional source of human cortical oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and define a lineage trajectory. We further show that human OPCs undergo consecutive symmetric divisions to exponentially increase the progenitor pool size. Additionally, we find that the OPC-enriched gene, PCDH15 , mediates daughter cell repulsion and facilitates proliferation. These findings indicate properties of OPC derivation, proliferation, and dispersion important for human white matter expansion and myelination.

Section: Introduction

Human cerebral white matter has enlarged dramatically during evolution, owing to increased axon fibers and glial cells. Myelinating oligodendrocytes, which first appear in jawed vertebrates, promote greatly enhanced saltatory conduction along axons of the central nervous system ( Zhang and Sejnowski, 2000 51.

While much insight into oligodendrocyte development has been gained from animal studies ( Fancy et al., 2011 11. Fancy, S.P. ∙ Chan, J.R. ∙ Baranzini, S.E. ...

In rodent forebrain, oligodendrocytes arise from the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in temporally distinct waves from the ganglionic eminences (GE) and the cortical ventricular zone (VZ) ( Kessaris et al., 2006 25.

Regulation of cerebral cortex size and folding by expansion of basal progenitors EMBO J. 2013; 32 :1817-1828 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ), human OPC production from the cortical OSVZ and mechanisms regulating their proliferation and expansion are poorly understood.
Here, we investigate the trajectory of human cortical OPC production. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with functional studies, we identify a type of gliogenic intermediate progenitor cell (IPC) (EGFR + Pre-OPC) with diminutive mitotic somal translocation (MST) behavior. We also find that oRG cells provide an extra source of OPC production in the human cortex. Furthermore, we observe high levels of OPC proliferation and describe a repulsive behavior between OPC daughter cells mediated by the OPC-enriched gene PCDH15 . The latter serves to avoid local OPC accumulation and facilitate OPC proliferation. These findings highlight an oligodendrocyte lineage in the human brain with enhanced precursor proliferation and a mechanism for cell dispersion, deepening our understanding of human oligodendrogenesis and white matter expansion.

Section: Results

In order to study the diversity and developmental trajectories of human OPCs, we first consulted a single-cell transcriptomic atlas generated from 48 individuals in the late first and second trimester of gestation ( Figures 1 A and 1B) that comprise neural progenitor cells (NPCs), IPCs, neurons, macroglia, microglia, and endothelial cells ( Nowakowski et al., 2017 33. Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Pollen, A.A. ... Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex Science. 2017; 358 :1318-1323 Crossref Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we found that only 40 of the 4,261 unbiased captured cells were OPCs that expressed PDGFRA ( Figure 1 B), possibly due to low abundance and high fragility. While fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of labeled transgenic mouse OPCs (e.g., PDGFRA -H2B- GFP ) has been used for scRNA-seq ( Marques et al., 2016 28. Marques, S. ∙ Zeisel, A. ∙ Codeluppi, S. ... Oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in the mouse juvenile and adult central nervous system Science. 2016; 352 :1326-1329 Crossref Scopus (679) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 29. Marques, S. ∙ van Bruggen, D. ∙ Vanichkina, D.P. ... Transcriptional convergence of oligodendrocyte lineage progenitors during development Dev. Cell. 2018; 46 :504-517.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ), we purified human embryonic OPCs by immunopanning ( Dugas and Emery, 2013 8. Dugas, J.C. ∙ Emery, B. Purification and culture of oligodendrocyte lineage cells Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2013; 2013 :810-814 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Barres, 2014 2. Barres, B.A. Designing and troubleshooting immunopanning protocols for purifying neural cells Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2014; 2014 :1342-1347 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A). Cortical cells were dissociated from nine brain samples at GW20–GW24, and cells expressing PDGFRA were collected using PDGFRA-antibody-coated Petri dishes. Immunostaining showed that most purified cells were PDGFRA + NKX2-2 + and scRNA-seq confirmed PDGFRA mRNA expression ( Figure 1 C). When we combined these PDGFRA-immunopanned cells with our previous 4,261 unbiased captured cells and clustered them by principal-component analysis (PCA) and Louvain-Jaccard clustering, a total of 980 high-quality cells were characterized as OPCs ( Figure 1 D). Differential gene expression analysis showed that these cells expressed conventional OPC genes OLIG1 , OLIG2 , PDGFRA , NKX2-2 , SOX10 , S100B , and APOD ( Figure 1 E). Conversely, they did not express the neuronal lineage genes EOMES , PPP1R17 , NEUROD2 , or NEUROD6 , and separated from clusters of IPCs, excitatory neurons (EN), and interneurons (INs) ( Figure 1 F).
The OPCs clustered into four groups (clusters 14, 2, 20, and 11). Metadata annotation showed that cortical OPCs acquired by unbiased-capture were comparable to OPCs enriched by PDGFRA immunopanning, and major groups were composed of cells from multiple individuals ( Figure 2 A), indicating minimal technical and/or batch artifacts. Cluster 20 included the largest number of PDGFRA-immunopanned cells ( Figure 2 A), and cluster 2 was similar, suggesting these two clusters might reflect OPCs at different maturation states. In contrast, cluster 11 expressed cell-cycling genes MKI67 , ASPM , TOP2A , and CDK1 , suggesting that these OPCs were actively dividing ( Figure 2 B). Metadata analysis showed that cluster 14 was mainly composed of cells micro-dissected from the cortical germinal zone (Cortex-VZ/SVZ) ( Figure 2 A). Cluster 14 expressed low levels of NPC genes, including GFAP , VIM , NES , HES1 , NOTCH2 , and EGFR , as well as oligodendrocyte lineage genes OLIG1 , OLIG2 , and PDGFRA ; the later stage OPC genes NKX2-2 , SOX10 , and APOD were not expressed ( Figure 2 B). Similarity analysis indicated that cluster 14 was closely related to both NPCs and OPCs ( Figure 2 C), suggesting a transitional “Pre-OPC” stage from multi-potent NPCs to lineage committed OPCs. This was supported by a trajectory reconstruction based upon our scRNA-seq dataset using monocle ( Trapnell et al., 2014 45. Trapnell, C. ∙ Cacchiarelli, D. ∙ Grimsby, J. ... The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (3552) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qiu et al., 2017 36. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (2112) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 D and 2E). According to the pseudo-lineage tree, VIM -expressing NPCs could generate Pre-OPCs or EOMES -expressing IPCs that further differentiate into NEUROD6 -expressing neurons. Feature plots showed NPC genes like VIM and GFAP were downregulated upon lineage commitment, while OPC genes like PDGFRA and APOD were upregulated. Together, our scRNA-seq analysis suggested a local intermediate progenitor source of Pre-OPCs supporting OPC generation in the developing human cortex.
While prior scRNA-seq analysis has indicated that mouse oligodendrocytes progress through various stages of differentiation ( Marques et al., 2016 28. Marques, S. ∙ Zeisel, A. ∙ Codeluppi, S. ... Oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in the mouse juvenile and adult central nervous system Science. 2016; 352 :1326-1329 Crossref Scopus (679) PubMed Google Scholar and 2018 29. Marques, S. ∙ van Bruggen, D. ∙ Vanichkina, D.P. ... Transcriptional convergence of oligodendrocyte lineage progenitors during development Dev. Cell. 2018; 46 :504-517.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ), the progenitor types that generate OPCs prior to lineage commitment remain unclear. We first used immunohistochemistry to characterize OPCs in fixed human cortical sections and found that PDGFRA + OLIG2 + OPCs were present in low numbers across all cortical laminae and were distributed radially from the VZ to the cortical plate (CP) during middle to late stages of neurogenesis (GW16 and GW18). The number of OPCs increased dramatically after GW20 and continued to increase at GW24, the latest age we studied ( Figures S1 A and S1B).
We next evaluated cluster 14 Pre-OPCs by co-staining OPC and NPC markers in GW20–24 tissue. While most PDGFRA + OLIG2 + OPCs did not express NPC markers, >10% of OPCs expressing low levels of PDGFRA and OLIG2 co-expressed NPC markers NES, GFAP, VIM, and EGFR, confirming an NPC signature ( Figure 3 A). EGFR + PDGFRA + cells also expressed OPC markers OLIG1 and NG2 and had bipolar morphology typical of OPCs ( Figure 3 A). Distribution analysis showed that most EGFR + PDGFRA + OLIG2 + cells were located in the OSVZ, though some were also present in the inner subventricular zone (ISVZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) ( Figure S1 C). Considering their NPC and OPC marker co-expression, immature bipolar morphology, and germinal zone location, we reasoned that these cells represent a transitional stage from NPCs to OPCs, consistent with our scRNA-seq data ( Figure 2 ).
In normal development, EGFR signaling regulates oligodendrogenesis and myelination in both juvenile and adult mice ( Aguirre et al., 2007 1. Aguirre, A. ∙ Dupree, J.L. ∙ Mangin, J.M. ... A functional role for EGFR signaling in myelination and remyelination Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10 :990-1002 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential gene analysis based on scRNA-seq showed that EGFR was enriched in cluster 14 and expressed in a subpopulation of NPCs ( Figures 2 B and 2E). At the onset of gliogenesis (GW20–24), we found a large population of EGFR + OLIG2 + cells in cortical germinal zones. These cells were present at low abundance at GW16–18 but increased dramatically between GW20 and 24 ( Figure S1 D), coinciding with OPC generation ( Figure S1 B). They were highly proliferative, with 50% expressing KI67, and were mainly located in the OSVZ ( Figure S1 D). We did not observe KI67 expression in cluster 14 in our scRNA-seq data ( Figure 2 B) because the abundance of cell-cycling genes drove the proliferative EGFR + OLIG2 + cells into cluster 11, which included both proliferative Pre-OPCs (EGFR + ) and dividing OPCs (EGFR – ). Unlike oRGs that exhibit a long radial process, EGFR-expressing cells were found randomly oriented in the germinal zone, being vertical, oblique, or even horizontal to the ventricular surface. Most EGFR + OLIG2 + cells did not express pS6 ( Figure 3 B), an oRG marker and a canonical readout of activated mTOR signaling ( Nowakowski et al., 2017 33. Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Pollen, A.A. ... Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex Science. 2017; 358 :1318-1323 Crossref Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, most TNC + SOX2 + oRGs in the OSVZ did not express EGFR ( Pollen et al., 2015 34. Pollen, A.A. ∙ Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Chen, J. ... Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development Cell. 2015; 163 :55-67 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 B). These results suggest that EGFR labels a population of progenitor cells in the OSVZ distinct from oRGs. Moreover, EGFR + OLIG2 + cells were EOMES – and PPP1R17 – , suggesting a lineage separation between oligodendrocytes and neurons ( Figure 3 B). Together these findings indicate that EGFR expression marks a pre-OPC in the human OSVZ.
We next tested whether the EGFR-expressing progenitors of human OSVZ could generate OPCs. Cells were dissociated from micro-dissected OSVZ at GW20–24. OPCs were depleted by two sequential rounds of PDGFRA and O4 immunopanning to ensure that any OPCs detected arose from precursor cells and not by OPC self-renewal ( Figure 3 C). Cells were further purified through positive selection by EGFR immunopanning. Such EGFR-expressing non-OPC cells were cultured in EGF-containing medium for 2 days and then in PDGF-containing medium for 5 days. Preps were fixed at 2 days in vitro (DIV2) or 7 days in vitro (DIV7). At DIV2, 90%–96% of the cells were EGFR + and 23% were OLIG2 + , but none were NG2 + , PDGFRA + , or NKX2-2 + , consistent with OPC depletion ( Figure 3 C). In contrast, by DIV7, the percentage of EGFR + cells was 40%–48%, while the percentage of OLIG2 + , PDGFRA + , NG2 + , and NKX2-2 + cells had increased to 35%, 35%, 36%, and 28%, respectively ( Figure 3 C). Reduction of EGFR-expressing progenitor cells accompanied the generation of OPCs, providing evidence that EGFR + progenitors in the human OSVZ have the ability to produce OPCs.
We reasoned that if the EGFR-expressing cells were progenitors of OPCs, then manipulation of the EGFR signaling pathway might affect EGFR-expressing cell proliferation and ultimately change OPC production. To test this possibility, we cultured human brain slices at GW20–24 and treated adjacent slices with EGF, or with the EGFR inhibitors, Iressa, AG1478, or PD153035. Slices were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 12 hr before fixation at DIV7. In comparison with DMSO-treated control slices, EGF treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the numbers of both OLIG2 + KI67 + and NKX2-2 + BrdU + cells; conversely, both populations were reduced significantly by EGFR inhibitor treatment ( Figure 3 D). This result combined with the differentiation assay supports the concept of local generation of OPCs from EGFR-expressing progenitors in late second trimester human cortex.
Neurogenic oRGs are a subtype of radial glia found in the primate OSVZ that are rare in rodents and are thought to contribute to gray matter expansion ( Hansen et al., 2010 19. Hansen, D.V. ∙ Lui, J.H. ∙ Parker, P.R. ... Neurogenic radial glia in the outer subventricular zone of human neocortex Nature. 2010; 464 :554-561 Crossref Scopus (1019) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fietz et al., 2010 13. Fietz, S.A. ∙ Kelava, I. ∙ Vogt, J. ... OSVZ progenitors of human and ferret neocortex are epithelial-like and expand by integrin signaling Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13 :690-699 Crossref Scopus (650) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the mechanisms underlying white matter expansion remain unknown, and whether oRGs are involved in human gliogenesis has not been fully demonstrated. The findings above show that, while VZ contains few PDGFRA + OLIG2 + cells, both PDGFRA + OLIG2 + KI67 + OPCs and EGFR + OLIG2 + KI67 + Pre-OPCs are mainly located in the OSVZ ( Figures S1 B and S1D). Through differential gene expression analysis of scRNA-seq data of human OPCs, we found that the Pre-OPC cluster also expressed the oRG genes PTPRZ1 , TNC , MOXD1 , HOPX , and FAM107A ( Pollen et al., 2015 34. Pollen, A.A. ∙ Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Chen, J. ... Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development Cell. 2015; 163 :55-67 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 B), suggesting that oRGs might generate Pre-OPCs.
Immunohistochemistry of fixed cortical sections between GW20 and GW24 showed that fewer than 2% of PDGFRA + OLIG2 + cells co-expressed the oRG markers, HOPX, PTPRZ1, TNC, and pS6 ( Figure S2 A). These cells were far less numerous than contemporaneous EGFR + PDGFRA + OLIG2 + cells. We already showed that most EGFR + OLIG2 + cells did not express the active mTOR readout and oRG marker pS6, and most TNC + Sox2 + oRGs also did not express EGFR ( Figure 3 B), but we found that about 10% of the PTPRZ1 + SOX2 + oRGs in the OSVZ expressed EGFR, and nearly 20% of EGFR + OLIG2 + progenitors were co-labeled with the oRG marker HOPX ( Figures S1 E and S2 B). This indicated that the expression time windows of different oRG markers might be slightly different from one another, and that some oRG progeny still retain oRG marker expression, enabling lineage tracing and trajectory reconstruction. Distribution analysis of cortical staining at GW22 revealed that the HOPX + EGFR + OLIG2 + cells were mainly located in the OSVZ ( Figure S1 E), suggesting that oRGs might be precursors of EGFR-expressing intermediate progenitors that produce OPCs. This concept is supported by our lineage trajectory reconstruction in which HOPX + TNC + oRGs give rise to VIM + EGFR + progenitors that further branch into EOMES + neurogenic IPCs or OLIG2 + Pre-OPCs ( Figures 2 D and 2E).
To directly test whether HOPX-expressing oRGs could generate OPCs, we micro-dissected OSVZ at GW20–24. Two sequential rounds of negative selection of (PDGFRA + O4) and EGFR immunopanning were performed in order to deplete both OPCs and Pre-OPCs in the cell suspension ( Figure S2 C). oRGs were further enriched through positive selection by LIFR immunopanning ( Pollen et al., 2015 34. Pollen, A.A. ∙ Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Chen, J. ... Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development Cell. 2015; 163 :55-67 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ) and expanded in LIF-containing medium for 2 days followed by EGF- and PDGF-containing medium for another 8 days. As shown ( Figure S2 C), at DIV2 around 90% of the cells expressed SOX2, and of these >90% co-expressed GFAP + HOPX + , indicating oRG identity ( Figure S2 C). In contrast, at DIV10, the percentage of SOX2 + cells decreased to 82%, and the percentage of GFAP + HOPX + co-expression decreased to 50%. Meanwhile, the percentage of EGFR + cells increased to 44%, and the percentage of PDGFRA + OLIG2 + cells increased to 17% ( Figure S2 C). These findings suggested LIFR-antibody-enriched oRGs are able to produce OPCs.
The observation that nearly all the PDGFRA + OLIG2 + OPCs generated at DIV10 also expressed EGFR indicates that oRGs generate OPCs through EGFR-expressing Pre-OPCs, consistent with the lineage reconstruction based on scRNA-seq analysis ( Figures 2 D and 2E). This differentiation assay combined with scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry data indicate that a population of late second trimester oRGs act as neural progenitors for oligodendrogenesis. Our results suggest that besides originating from ventricular radial glia (vRG) present in both rodent and primate brain, the large abundance of oRGs in the developing human brain provides an extra source of OPC production not found in rodents, that could enhance oligodendrocyte generation and boost myelination to match demands arising from increased neurogenesis in the human brain.
We next studied the proliferative behavior of Pre-OPCs compared to oRGs and OPCs by time-lapse imaging. Due to the diversity of progenitors in the germinal zones at late second trimester and the lack of genetic tools to specifically label OPCs, EGFR-expressing IPCs, or oRGs, we dissociated cortical cells from OSVZ at GW20–24 and performed immunopanning to selectively enrich specific progenitor populations through sequential positive selection with PDGFRA, EGFR, and LIFR antibodies ( Figure 4 A). We labeled the enriched progenitor types with CMV - GFP adenovirus, transplanted the virus-labeled progenitors back into OSVZ of adjacent slices, and cultured the brain slices without growth factors ( Figure 4 B).
To validate the identity of enriched cells, we performed 10X scRNA-seq of the immunopanned cells prior to virus infection and transplantation ( Figure S3 A). Most LIFR-panned cells expressed LIFR , and the major clusters showed enrichment for GFAP , PAX6 , HOPX , and PTPRZ1 , indicating oRG identity; the remaining non-oRG clusters were astrocytes, LIFR-expressing microglia, or newborn neurons ( Figure S3 A and S3B). Similarly, most EGFR-panned cells expressed EGFR and were enriched for NES , SOX2 , and VIM , consistent with immunostaining in fixed brain slices and indicating progenitor identity ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Most PDGFRA-panned cells expressed PDGFRA , and the major clusters were also enriched for OLIG1 , OLIG2 , NKX2-2 , and SOX10 , reflecting OPC identity ( Figures S3 A and S3B).
Video frames were captured every 35 min for 72 hr (DIV3–6) and GFP-labeled progenitors were observed to migrate on cultured brain slices and divide. Interestingly, most LIFR-panned cells acquired a long radial fiber after transplantation, characteristic of radial glia ( Figure S3 C). The remaining non-radial cells might represent off-target cells or progeny generated by oRGs during the 3 days required for cell recovery and virus expression. Both EGFR- and PDGFRA-panned cells exhibited bipolar morphology but did not show any orientation preference ( Figure S3 C). Radial cells enriched by LIFR-panning exhibited MST ( Figure 4 C; Video S1 ), a “jump-and-divide” behavior of oRGs ( Hansen et al., 2010 19. Hansen, D.V. ∙ Lui, J.H. ∙ Parker, P.R. ...

While most EGFR-panned cells also jumped and divided, the distance of MST was much smaller than oRGs ( Figure 4 C; Video S2 ). Both EGFR-panned daughter cells regrew processes, resembling OPCs ( Figure 4 C). After division, daughter cells of both oRGs and EGFR-panned cells stayed close to each other, while the daughter cells of OPCs rapidly migrated away from each other. Figures 4 D and 4E show the quantification of MST distance and daughter cell distance from 30 samples of each type of cell. Thus, EGFR-expressing cells exhibit their own proliferation pattern but with features resembling a combination of oRG and OPC behavior. Lineage reconstruction by monocle based on scRNA-seq data of unbiased captured cells ( Bhaduri et al., 2020 5. Bhaduri, A. ∙ Andrews, M.G. ∙ Mancia Leon, W. ... Cell stress in cortical organoids impairs molecular subtype specification Nature. 2020; 578 :142-148 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ) also supports the developmental trajectory from oRG to EGFR-expressing IPC to OPC ( Figure S3 D). We incubated brain slices with either EGF or the EGFR inhibitor, Iressa, after EGFR panning, virus labeling, and cell transplantation. When post-stained for NKX2-2 and GFP at DIV7 and compared with DMSO-treated control slices, EGF treatment increased while Iressa treatment decreased OPC production from EGFR-panned cells ( Figure 4 E), indicating an essential role of EGFR-expressing cells in OPC generation.

We next focused on the proliferative ability of OPCs by studying the time-lapse image data generated above. An average of 20 cells were found to divide within a single visual field, and 42 cells were observed to undergo two rounds of division among all 24 visual fields. Figure 5 A shows an example of an OPC that divided to generate two daughter cells, both of which divided again at similar time points to produce four granddaughter cells ( Video S3 ). These observations suggest that OPCs undergo frequent repeated symmetric divisions to exponentially increase the progenitor cell pool. This differs from observations of the mouse brain at comparable neonatal ages, where NG2 -expressing OPCs divide only once in a 5-day period to generate two daughter cells that continue to express NG2 for several days before one or both differentiate into oligodendrocytes ( Zhu et al., 2011 52.

Representative Video of an OPC Undergoing Two Rounds of Continuous Division, Related to Figure 5
Robust OPC migratory behavior resulted in daughter cells often leaving the field of vision, making it difficult to quantitatively analyze the percentage of continuously dividing OPCs by live imaging. Thus, we performed thymidine analog labeling to quantify cell divisions ( Figure 5 B). We labeled PDGFRA-panned OPCs with CMV - GFP adenovirus prior to transplantation into cultured brain slices, incubated brain slices with the thymidine analog, chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU), for 12 hr followed by 24 hr without thymidine analog, and then another 12 hr exposure to the thymidine analog, iododeoxyuridine (IdU), followed by 24 hr without thymidine analog prior to fixation. This was intended to differentially label successive rounds of cell division and to avoid CldU and IdU incorporation into cells during the same S-phase, as our time-lapse imaging indicated that the time interval between two rounds of division was about 36 hr. After fixation we stained the brain slices with OLIG2 that labeled 95% of GFP cells, indicating a high efficiency of OPC enrichment. Approximately 35% of GFP + OLIG2 + cells were either CldU + or IdU + , while 8% of GFP + OLIG2 + cells were CldU + IdU + , indicating two rounds of cell division after OPC commitment ( Figure 5 B). Considering that cells were exposed to the thymidine analog for only 1/3 of their cell cycle and that the cycling OPCs were unsynchronized, the proportion of cycling cells should be triple the thymidine analog-labeled number. Thus, both time-lapse imaging and thymidine analog labeling suggest near continuous division of OPCs in the developing human brain. These results support the concept that during human cortical development, OPCs undergo a prolonged period of proliferation before differentiation and thus act as transit amplifying cells to greatly increase the progenitor pool through symmetric division.
Previous studies and our time-lapse imaging of LIFR- and EGFR-panned cells show that the daughter cells of progenitors usually stay in contact or close to each other long after division ( Hansen et al., 2010 19. Hansen, D.V. ∙ Lui, J.H. ∙ Parker, P.R. ... Neurogenic radial glia in the outer subventricular zone of human neocortex Nature. 2010; 464 :554-561 Crossref Scopus (1019) PubMed Google Scholar ; Betizeau et al., 2013 4. Betizeau, M. ∙ Cortay, V. ∙ Patti, D. ... Precursor diversity and complexity of lineage relationships in the outer subventricular zone of the primate Neuron. 2013; 80 :442-457 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ; Subramanian et al., 2017 43. Subramanian, L. ∙ Bershteyn, M. ∙ Paredes, M.F. ... Dynamic behaviour of human neuroepithelial cells in the developing forebrain Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14167 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our time-lapse imaging of PDGFRA-panned cells revealed an unusual behavior. Immediately following OPC division, the newly generated daughter cells appeared to repel each other and migrate rapidly in opposite directions ( Figure 4 C). We reasoned that this behavior might serve to ensure broad distribution of OPCs across the developing cortex.
To explore the mechanism underlying repulsion, we first compared the RNA profiles of dividing OPCs with other dividing cortical progenitors whose daughters do not repel each other after division (RGs and IPCs). The list of differentially expressed genes included the cell-surface molecules PCDH15 and DSCAM , which ranked high among OPC-enriched genes ( Figures 6 A and 6B). DSCAM belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It promotes repulsion between neurites and mediates tiling between neurons ( Fuerst et al., 2008 17. Fuerst, P.G. ∙ Koizumi, A. ∙ Masland, R.H. ... Neurite arborization and mosaic spacing in the mouse retina require DSCAM Nature. 2008; 451 :470-474 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hattori et al., 2008 20. Hattori, D. ∙ Millard, S.S. ∙ Wojtowicz, W.M. ... Dscam-mediated cell recognition regulates neural circuit formation Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24 :597-620 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCDH15 is a member of the protocadherin superfamily. Although the function of PCDH15 in OPC development is unknown, other members of the protocadherin family have been reported to mediate dendritic self-avoidance ( Lefebvre et al., 2012 26. Lefebvre, J.L. ∙ Kostadinov, D. ∙ Chen, W.V. ... Protocadherins mediate dendritic self-avoidance in the mammalian nervous system Nature. 2012; 488 :517-521 Crossref Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In order to study the function of PCDH15 and DSCAM in OPCs, we used knockdown of PCDH15 or DSCAM by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus ( Figures S4 A and S4B). We performed PDGFRA immunopanning to enrich human OPCs at GW20–24 and infected them with either PCDH15 -shRNA- GFP or DSCAM -shRNA- GFP lentivirus. We transplanted the virus-infected OPCs into cultured cortical slices and performed time-lapse imaging at DIV3–6. The scramble-control exhibited similar behavior to that observed in the CMV - GFP adenovirus-labeled cells ( Figures 4 C and 5 A; Video S3 ); namely, OPC daughter cells repelled each other and migrated rapidly in opposite directions ( Figure 6 C; Video S4 ). In contrast, the PCDH15 -shRNA-infected daughter cells remained in contact with or close to each other following division, often for many hours ( Figure 6 C; Video S5 ). Quantitative analysis of daughter cell distances from one another showed dramatic increases at 5, to 10, and 15 hr after OPC division in the scramble control, while the separation between daughter cells was much smaller in PCDH15 -shRNA at the same time points, with no obvious increase between different time points ( Figure 6 D), indicating significant inhibition of daughter cell dispersion after PCDH15 knockdown. Statistical analysis of the migration speed before division shows no obvious difference between scramble-control and PCDH1 5-shRNA ( Figure 6 E), indicating that the inhibition of OPC dispersion is not due to an underlying mobility defect. The DSCAM -shRNA-infected OPCs repelled each other similarly to control, indicating DSCAM is dispensable for daughter cell repulsion.

To confirm that PCDH15 plays a key role in OPC daughter cell repulsion, we blocked PCDH15 function by an antibody targeting its extracellular domain ( Figure S4 C). OPCs were enriched by PDGFRA immunopanning and labeled with CMV - GFP adenovirus. Two days after cell transplantation, we applied PCDH15 antibody or control IgG to the cultured brain slices and performed live imaging at DIV3–6. While OPC behavior was normal in the control IgG-treated slices ( Figure S4 D; Video S6 ), PCDH15-antibody-treated brain slices resembled PCDH15 knockdown, with OPC sister cells lingering together long after cell division ( Figure S4 D; Video S7 ). These findings indicated that PCDH15 function is required for daughter cell separation after OPC division, a behavior that might be important for evenly distributing OPCs across the cortex.

As self-avoidance is often closely related to tiling ( Hattori et al., 2008 20. Hattori, D. ∙ Millard, S.S. ∙ Wojtowicz, W.M. ... Dscam-mediated cell recognition regulates neural circuit formation Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24 :597-620 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wondered whether PCDH15 plays a role in OPC tiling, a phenomenon that distributes OPCs in a non-redundant manner to maximize coverage of the surface while minimizing overlap between neighboring OPCs ( Hughes et al., 2013 23. Hughes, E.G. ∙ Kang, S.H. ∙ Fukaya, M. ... Oligodendrocyte progenitors balance growth with self-repulsion to achieve homeostasis in the adult brain Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :668-676 Crossref Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cultured human cortical slices were incubated with PCDH15 antibody and fixed at DIV7. We labeled OPCs with OLIG2 and O4 to show their nuclei and processes. In comparison with IgG control, PCDH15-antibody-treated slices showed no significant differences in either soma distribution or process arborization ( Figure 7 A), indicating PCDH15 is not essential for OPC tiling. Furthermore, when we analyzed the time-lapse imaging data of PDGFRA-panned cells, we observed no obvious repulsion between two random OPCs when they encounter each other ( Video S8 ), suggesting PCDH15-mediated repulsion is specific between daughter cells post-division.

Representative Video of Two OPCs Encountering Each Other, Related to Figure 7
Interestingly, many PCDH15-shRNA daughter cells did not re-enter the cell cycle, even long after dividing (>40 hr), while the Scramble-control OPCs usually underwent two rounds of division during this same interval. Figure 7 B shows one PCDH15 -shRNA-infected OPC sample that divided to generate two daughter cells close to each other. Instead of both daughter cells dividing to generate four granddaughter cells at a second round of division ( Figure 5 A; Video S3 ), only one daughter cell divided to generate two granddaughter cells close to each other, while the other daughter cell remained quiescent ( Video S9 ). This suggested that failure of dispersion of daughter cells might inhibit further division, potentially helping to achieve homeostatic control of local OPC density. To confirm that blocking PCDH15 function affects OPC proliferation, we fixed cultured human cortical slices treated with PCDH15 antibody or control IgG at DIV7 and post-stained with NKX2-2 and KI67. While there was no significant difference in the density of NKX2-2 + cells between conditions, both number and percentage of NKX2-2 + KI67 + cells were significantly reduced by incubation with the PCDH15 antibody. Thus, both time-lapse imaging and antibody-blocking experiments support the idea that PCDH15 mediates daughter cell separation and dispersion, serving to prevent local OPC accumulation and facilitate OPC proliferation.

Section: Discussion

The evolutionary expansion of gray matter has been attributed to a prolonged gestational period as well as the presence of different neural stem cell populations and IPCs that greatly increase the neuronal output of cortical germinal niches ( Lui et al., 2011 27. Lui, J.H. ∙ Hansen, D.V. ∙ Kriegstein, A.R. Development and evolution of the human neocortex Cell. 2011; 146 :18-36 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1009) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we investigated cellular origins and genetic mechanisms underlying white matter expansion and how oligodendrocyte production is regulated to meet the increased demands for myelination. By combining scRNA-seq, in vivo immunohistochemistry, ex vivo brain slice culture, and time-lapse imaging, we mapped the lineage trajectory of OPCs from oRGs of the OSVZ in the developing human cortex and identified an intermediate progenitor cell type, we call the EGFR + Pre-OPC. We also observed enhanced proliferation of embryonic OPCs that helps produce the large number of oligodendrocytes associated with human cortical expansion and described a PCDH15 -mediated repulsive behavior between OPC daughter cells that promotes dispersal of OPCs and facilitates OPC proliferation. These findings extend our comprehension of human cortical expansion and human oligodendrogenesis.
During peak periods of neurogenesis in human cortical development (GW13–19), oRGs populate the OSVZ and produce EOMES-expressing transit-amplifying IPCs that ultimately generate neurons. The abundance of oRGs in primates contributes to the production of large numbers of neurons and provides a secondary radial glia scaffold to support neuronal migration ( Lui et al., 2011 27. Lui, J.H. ∙ Hansen, D.V. ∙ Kriegstein, A.R.

Neuronal migration dynamics in the developing ferret cortex J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :14307-14315 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, direct evidence for a possible role of oRGs in gliogenesis is lacking ( Rowitch and Kriegstein, 2010 39. Rowitch, D.H. ∙ Kriegstein, A.R. Developmental genetics of vertebrate glial-cell specification Nature. 2010; 468 :214-222 Crossref Scopus (517) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent study of the developing macaque suggested that oRGs support oligodendrogenesis but lacked functional validation ( Rash et al., 2019 38. Rash, B.G. ∙ Duque, A. ∙ Morozov, Y.M. ... Gliogenesis in the outer subventricular zone promotes enlargement and gyrification of the primate cerebrum Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :7089-7094 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), highlighting the need for experimental studies to determine the identity and role of oligodendrocyte progenitors in the developing primate brain. Here, by combining scRNA-seq with functional experiments, we find evidence for oRG-derived OPC generation in the human cerebral cortex. Our study highlights the important role of oRGs for both neurogenesis and gliogenesis. It will be interesting to further compare early neurogenic oRGs with late oligodendrogenic oRGs and study the mechanisms underlying the temporal switch from neurogenesis to oligodendrogenesis.
EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer, where excessive activation of EGFR signaling often leads to hyper-proliferation of tumor cells ( da Cunha Santos et al., 2011 7. da Cunha Santos, G. ∙ Shepherd, F.A. ∙ Tsao, M.S.

Here, at the onset of gliogenesis, we find that large numbers of EGFR expressing progenitors occupy germinal zones of the embryonic human cortex and support OPC production. Both lineage reconstruction and differentiation assays indicate that oRGs do not generate OPCs directly; instead, EGFR-expressing cells act as intermediate progenitors for oligodendrogenesis. The existence of proliferative Pre-OPCs in the lineage between oRGs and OPCs may serve to increase rounds of division and enlarge the progenitor pool size. The responsiveness of Pre-OPCs to EGF suggests a tight regulation of OPC production by EGF secreted in the progenitor cell niche of the developing cortex. Interestingly, we find that a subset of oRGs express EGF mRNA in our scRNA-seq database. This suggests a possible mechanism for coordination between neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis that could serve to match the increase in neuron production to the requirement of more oligodendrocytes for axon myelination. Alternatively, it might represent a positive feedforward mechanism to facilitate OPC production.
In the adult mouse brain, OPCs tile to occupy mutually exclusive territories through a balance between proliferation and self-repulsion, although the molecular mechanisms are unknown ( Hughes et al., 2013 23. Hughes, E.G. ∙ Kang, S.H. ∙ Fukaya, M. ... Oligodendrocyte progenitors balance growth with self-repulsion to achieve homeostasis in the adult brain Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :668-676 Crossref Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the embryonic human cortex, we observed a self-avoidance behavior between daughter cells following OPC division. This behavior is very different from the phenotype observed in other dividing cells of the developing cortex, including RGs or IPCs, where daughter cells stay in contact long after division ( Noctor et al., 2001 31. Noctor, S.C. ∙ Flint, A.C. ∙ Weissman, T.A. ... Neurons derived from radial glial cells establish radial units in neocortex Nature. 2001; 409 :714-720 Crossref Scopus (1629) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hansen et al., 2010 19.

Precursor diversity and complexity of lineage relationships in the outer subventricular zone of the primate Neuron. 2013; 80 :442-457 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is particularly notable when RGs divide asymmetrically to self-renew and generate a neuron which remains in contact with the parent RG fiber as it migrates. Consecutive divisions of individual rodent RGs and their IPC daughter cells produce a clone of sister cells that remain in contact and eventually form a columnar array of clustered neocortical neurons ( Noctor et al., 2001 31. Noctor, S.C. ∙ Flint, A.C. ∙ Weissman, T.A. ... Neurons derived from radial glial cells establish radial units in neocortex Nature. 2001; 409 :714-720 Crossref Scopus (1629) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2009 49. Yu, Y.C. ∙ Bultje, R.S. ∙ Wang, X. ... Specific synapses develop preferentially among sister excitatory neurons in the neocortex Nature. 2009; 458 :501-504 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, when OPCs in our study divide symmetrically, the two daughter OPCs strongly repel each other and migrate in opposite directions. This behavior likely serves to avoid local accumulation and ensure broad distribution of OPCs. We find that the mechanism of repulsion involves the protocadherin superfamily member PCDH15 that is selectively enriched in OPCs. According to our differential expression data, DSCAM is also enriched in OPCs, but our functional assays indicate it is not involved in daughter cell repulsion, highlighting the specificity of PCDH15 for OPC dispersion. Furthermore, we observe that failure of daughter cell separation impairs the ability of daughter cells to engage in subsequent divisions, reflecting a cellular mechanism underlying homeostatic control of OPC density during development and highlighting the importance OPC dispersion on OPC proliferation and white matter expansion.
PCDH15 is not only a gene differentially expressed between dividing OPCs and RGs or IPCs but also serves as an OPC marker gene. Because our database was composed of most cell types present in the developing human cerebral cortex, including RGs, IPCs, neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, our gene expression database afforded an opportunity to discover marker genes for OPCs. Differential gene expression analysis highlighted several additional cell-type-specific candidate genes, such as LHFPL3 , B3GNT7 , LUZP2 , and SCN1A ( Figure S5 A). Future work elucidating the function of these genes in OPC biology may provide insight into human oligodendrocyte development.
High-throughput sequencing has uncovered a number of gene mutations related to cortical malformations including microcephaly, lissencephaly, and polymicrogyria ( Walsh, 1999 47. Walsh, C.A. Genetic malformations of the human cerebral cortex Neuron. 1999; 23 :19-29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hu et al., 2014 22. Hu, W.F. ∙ Chahrour, M.H. ∙ Walsh, C.A. The diverse genetic landscape of neurodevelopmental disorders Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2014; 15 :195-213 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although a majority of the gene mutations in patients are germline mutations, most studies of the molecular and cellular mechanisms have focused on the neuronal lineage, while abnormalities in glia have generally not been considered. Our scRNA-seq dataset shows that many genes related to brain malformation are also enriched in OPCs. For example, the microcephaly related genes ASPM , STIL , CEP135 , CDK6 , RBBP8 , CEP152 , and CENPJ are all highly expressed in neuronal progenitors including dividing RGs and IPCs, but they are also highly expressed in dividing OPCs ( Figure S5 B), suggesting that disease-causing mutations in these genes might also directly interfere with the production of oligodendrocytes and thus contribute to microcephaly. Additionally, our dataset indicates that many polymicrogyria related genes are expressed broadly in both neural progenitors and OPCs, and many of the genes, such as GPR56 , ATP6V0A2 , GPSM2 , NDE1 , RAB18 , CCND2 , PTEN , DYNC1H1 , KIF5C , TUBA1A , TUBB2A , TUBB2B , BICD2 , DDX3X , EZH2 , and OFD1 , show equal or even higher expression levels in OPCs compared with other cell types ( Figure S5 C). This strongly suggests that an abnormality in OPCs might contribute to polymicrogyria. Together, these cell-type-selective gene expression patterns can inform future analysis of genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental diseases.

Fluidigm C1 and 10x Genomics raw sequencing data were deposited to the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), accession number phs000989.v4.p1. No custom code was used for the analysis of this data and publicly available algorithm usage is described in the analysis section.
De-identified tissue samples were collected with previous patient consent in strict observance of the legal and institutional ethical regulations from elective pregnancy termination specimens at San Francisco General Hospital. Protocols were approved by the Human Gamete, Embryo and Stem Cell Research Committee (institutional review board) at the University of California, San Francisco. Human brain tissue was transported to the laboratory within 2h of collection in artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 125mM NaCl, 2.5mM KCl, 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM CaCl 2 , 1.25mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 25mm NaHCO 3 , 25mm D-glucose, bubbled with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 .
Primary tissue samples were cut into 1cm3 pieces and fixed in 4% PFA in Ca 2+ /Mg2+ free PBS (pH = 7.4) for 1h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C with constant agitation. After fixation, they were washed in PBS, equilibrated in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C, embedded in blocks with a 1:1 mixture of 30% sucrose / OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, VWR) and frozen at −80°C. Blocks were frozen sectioned to a thickness of 16-20um cyosections. Antigen retrieval was performed if necessary, by heating section to 95°C in 10mM sodium citrate (pH = 6) for 20min. Sections were then permeablized and blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% gelatin. Primary antibody incubations were performed at 4°C overnight, followed by three times of 10min PBS wash, and AlexaFluor secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher, 1:500 dilution) with DAPI incubations were performed at room temperature for 3hr. To detect thymidine analogs (BrdU, CldU or IdU), sections were denatured with 2N HCl for 1hr at room temperature followed by neutralization with 0.1M boric acid, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as described above. Slides were mounted with Aqua-mount (Lerner Laboratories). For quantitative analysis of cell numbers in Figures S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 , samples were from 2 to 3 independent biological individuals, and 6 fields of microscrope images from each individual at each position (VZ/ISVZ/OSVZ/IZ/SP/CP) were included. For quantitative analysis of cell numbers in Figure 5 B, 10 fields of microscrope images from each individual were included and the experiment was repeated in 3 independent biological individuals.
Tissue samples were dissected in artificial cerebrospinal fluid using a microsurgical blade under a stereotaxic dissection microscope (Leica). To obtain single cell suspension, tissue samples were further cut into small pieces (< 1mm 3 ) and placed in a 6cm dish containing a pre-warmed solution of Papain and DNase freshly diluted in Earl’s Balanced Salt Solution that was prepared according to the manufacturer protocol (Worthington Biochemical Corporation). After incubation at 37°C for 1h, tissue was centrifuged at 220 g for 1 min to remove the Papain/DNase supernatant, washed with a OVO protease inhibitor stock solution. After centrifugation at 220 g for 10min, and resuspension in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium / Nutrient Mixture F-12, tissue was further gently triturated by pipetting up and down approximately 10 times into a single cells suspension. The cell suspension was then added to a series of plastic Petri dishes pre-coated with cell-type-specific antibodies and incubated at 37°C for 30min to 1h each. Unbound cells were transferred to the subsequent Petri dish; while the dish with bound cells was rinsed 10 times with DPBS to wash away loosely bound contaminating cell types. Bound cells were digested with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA, centrifuge at 220 g for 15min, and resuspended in corresponding medium.
Culture chamber slides were prepared by overnight coating with 0.01% poly-L-ornithine (Millipore Sigma) at 37°C. After three water washes, plates were coated with 5ug/ml laminin (Thermo Fisher) and 1ug/ml fibronectin (Corning) for 2hr. Single cell suspension was plated in the culture chamber slides at the concentration of 10 5 /well for 8 well chambers or 2X10 5 /well for 4 well chambers. Cells were cultured in the medium containing N2 supplement (1:100, Thermo FIsher), B27 supplement (1:50, Thermo Fisher), LIF (20ng/ml, Peprotech), EGF (20ng/ml, Peprotech), Insulin (5ug/ml, Sigma), Penicillin/Streptomycin (100U/ml) in DMEM/F12+GlutamaxTM-I (Thermo Fisher) for the first 2 days, and then in the medium containing N2 supplement, B27 supplement, Insulin, NAC (5ug/ml, Sigma), Biotin (10ng/ml, Sigma), Trace Elements B (1000X, Thermo Fisher), CNTF (10ng/ml, Pepotech), PDGF (20ng/ml, Peprotech), NT-3 (1ng/ml, Peprotech), Penicillin/Streptomycin (100U/ml) in DMEM/F12+GlutamaxTM-I (Thermo Fisher) for the subsequent 5 or 8 days. Cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . For quantitative analysis of cell numbers in Figures 3 C and S5 C, 5 fields of microscrope images from each individual were included and the experiment was repeated in 3 independent biological individuals.
Primary tissue samples were cut into 5mm thick pieces, and embedded in 3% low melting point agarose (Thermo Fisher) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid and sectioned into 250um using a Leica VT1200S vibrating blade microtome in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Slices were then plated on Millicell inserts (Millipore) in the 6-well plate in the medium containing 60% Basal Medium Eagle (Thermo Fisher), 25% Hank’s BSS (Thermo Fisher), 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin/Glutamine (Thermo Fisher), 1% N2 (Thermo Fisher), and 0.66% glucose. Slices were then cultured at 37°C, 5%CO2 and 8% O2 for up to 1 week. For pharmacological treatment assays, EGFR activator EGF was added into the slice culture medium at the final concentration of 50ng/ml [EGF(L)] or 200ng/ml [EGF(H)], while EGFR inhibitors Iressa, AG1478, and PD153035 were added into the slice culture medium at the final concentration of 50nM. For transplantation assays, primary cells were enriched by immunopanning, incubated with CMV-GFP adenovirus for 1hr or shRNA lentivirus for 3hr, washed in DPBS for twice, and injected into the cultured slices using a glass needle pipette. A total of 10 5 cells were evenly injected into 3 pieces of 1cm 2 brain slices. For thymidine incubation assay, CldU, IdU, or BrdU was added into the slice culture medium at the final concentration of 10nM for 12hr, and three iterations of PBS washing were performed after each thymidine treatment. For quantitative analysis of cell numbers in Figures 3 D, 4 E, and 7 C, 6 fields of microscrope images under each treatment from each individual were included and the experiment was repeated in 3 independent biological individuals.
After 2-3 days culture, GFP-expressing brain slices were transferred into glass-bottom plate with fresh medium, placed to an inverted Leica TCS SP5 with an on-stage incubator streaming 5% CO 2 , 8% O 2 , balance N 2 into the chamber. Slices were imaged for GFP using a 10X air objective (Zoom 2X) at 35 min intervals for up to 3 or 5 days with repositioning of the z stacks every 24hr. For quantitative analysis in Figures 4 D, 6 D and 6E, 30 cells from 2-3 independent biological individuals were pooled together.
For Fluidigm C1 scRNA-seq, cDNA synthesis and pre-amplification were performed as described before ( Nowakowski et al., 2017 33. Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Pollen, A.A. ... Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex Science. 2017; 358 :1318-1323 Crossref Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Fluidigm C1 auto-prep system following manufacturer’s protocol. After capture, microscope imaging was performed to identify wells with either debris or doublets and retain single-cell wells; these identifications were used in downstream analysis. Library preparation was performed using the llumina Nextera XT library preparation kit. Library concentration quantification was performed using Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Paired-end 100bp sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500.
For 10X Genomics scRNA-seq, target capture of 10,000 cells per sample was used; cDNA synthesis, pre-amplification and library preparation were performed as described before ( Bhaduri et al., 2020 5. Bhaduri, A. ∙ Andrews, M.G. ∙ Mancia Leon, W. ... Cell stress in cortical organoids impairs molecular subtype specification Nature. 2020; 578 :142-148 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ) following manufacturer’s protocol “User Guide: Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits (V3 Chemistry).” Libraries from individual samples were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 machine.
Trim Galore 3.7 was used to trim 20 bp of adaptor sequencing, and paired-end alignments were performed using HISAT2 to the human reference genome GRCh38. Counts for each cell were performed using subread-1.5.0 function featureCounts. After counts were obtained, normalization to counts per million was performed. Quality control was performed to further ensure that only high quality single cell data was processed further, and cells with fewer than 1000 genes/cell were removed, as were cells with greater than 10% of their individual transcriptome represented in either mitochondrial or ribosomal transcripts. Only genes expressed in at least 30 cells were carried forward in the analysis. For 10X data, the standard Cellranger v3 pipeline was used for alignment and counting.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, and clustering was performed as previously described ( Shekhar et al., 2016 40. Shekhar, K. ∙ Lapan, S.W. ∙ Whitney, I.E. ... Comprehensive classification of retinal bipolar neurons by single-cell transcriptomics Cell. 2016; 166 :1308-1323 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). In PC space, for each cell, the top 30 nearest neighbors were calculated for each cell using the ‘RANN’ R package nn2 function. The Jaccard distance, a weighted distance metric based upon the mutually shared neighbor sets for each pair of neighboring cells was calculated prior to clustering. With the Jaccard weighted distances, louvain clustering was performed using the ‘igraph’ R package. TSNE coordinates were calculated in PCA space (independent of the clusters). Differential expression to identify cluster markers was performed using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat. The heatmap was generated using key marker genes in the space of a subset of clusters relevant to the analysis. The similarity matrix was calculated by correlating clusters to one another in principal component space. For 10X data, Seurat v3 default clustering parameters were used.
Monocle version 2 was used to generate the trajectory analysis. Excitatory neurons, IPCs, RGCs, and OPCs were extracted based upon the above clustering. These cells were re-clustered as above and used as the input to Monocle. Differential gene expression for trajectory construction was performed using these cluster annotations, and metadata of broad cell type was used to color the plot.
HEK293T cells were plated in 12-well plates, and 200ng of cDNA vectors of PCDH15 (NM_001142763.1, Sino Biological HG18931-UT) or DSCAM (NM_001271534.1, Sino Biological HG19944-UT) with 600ng of corresponding shRNA vectors were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 3000. Cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection for mRNA extraction using the RNAeasy micro plus kit. RNA quantity and quality were checked using NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed using the ViiA 7 Real-time PCR System with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix, and analyzed with comparative Ct method normalized against the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Cells were harvested 72 hours after transfection for protein extraction. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysates were homogenized by sonication followed by protein quantification via BCA assay (Pierce). LDS Sample buffer (Invitrogen) with a reducing agent was added to each lysate followed by a 10 min incubation at 95°C. Samples were spun down and electrophoresed on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked for one hour with Intercept (TBS) Protein-Free Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) prior to primary antibody incubation o/n. After 1-hour secondary antibody incubation the next day, membranes were imaged using an Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR).
Additionally, OPCs were enriched by PDGFRA-immunopanning and cultured in 12-well plates (for qRT-PCR) or 6-well plate (for western blotting). When the cell density reached 80% of coverage, cells were infected with PCDH15-shRNA or DSCAM-shRNA lentiviruses. OPCs were harvest three days after infection for qRT-PCR, or five days after infection for western blotting.
HEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates, and 1ug PCDH15 (NM_001142763.1, Sino Biological HG18931-UT), PCDH9 (Dharmacon OHS6085-213579205), or PCHD17 (Dharmacon MHS6278-202801988) cDNA vectors were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 3000. For flow cytometry analysis to assay antibody specificity, cells were released 72 hours after cDNA transfection using PBS-EDTA (Lonza). 2 × 10 ∧ 6 cells per condition were used for PCDH15 primary antibody (R&D systems AF6729, 1:40) staining in FACS staining buffer (D-PBS, 1% BSA, 2mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide) for 30 minutes on ice. Next, cells were washed in FACS staining buffer and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:400) for 30 minutes on ice. After final washes, Sytox Red (Invitrogen, 1:1000) was added to stain dead cells. Flow cytometry was carried out on an BD LSRFortessa X-20.
Quantification of images was performed using the Imaris Image Analysis software (Bitplane). Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Statistical tests, significance values, and experimental n are included in figure legends. All data are shown as mean ± SD. In all cases, p values are represented as follows: ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗ p < 0.5, and N.S. when p > 0.5.
For quantitative analysis of cell numbers in Figure S1 , samples were from 2 to 3 independent biological individuals, and 6 fields of microscrope images from each individual at each position (VZ/ISVZ/OSVZ/IZ/SP/CP) were included. For quantitative analysis of cell numbers in Figures 3 C and S2 C, 5 fields of microscrope images from each individual were included and the experiment was repeated in 3 independent biological individuals. For quantitative analysis of cell numbers in Figures 3 D, 4 E, and 7 C, 6 fields of microscrope images under each treatment from each individual were included and the experiment was repeated in 3 independent biological individuals. For quantitative analysis of cell numbers in Figure 5 B, 10 fields of microscrope images from each individual were included and the experiment was repeated in 3 independent biological individuals. For quantitative analysis in Figures 4 D, 6 D, and 6E, 30 cells from 2-3 independent biological individuals were pooled together.
