Title: A natural single-guide RNA repurposes Cas9 to autoregulate CRISPR-Cas expression


Abstract: Summary

CRISPR-Cas systems provide prokaryotes with acquired immunity against viruses and plasmids, but how these systems are regulated to prevent autoimmunity is poorly understood. Here, we show that in the S. pyogenes CRISPR-Cas system, a long-form transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracr-L) folds into a natural single guide that directs Cas9 to transcriptionally repress its own promoter (P cas ). Further, we demonstrate that P cas serves as a critical regulatory node. De-repression causes a dramatic 3,000-fold increase in immunization rates against viruses; however, heightened immunity comes at the cost of increased autoimmune toxicity. Using bioinformatic analyses, we provide evidence that tracrRNA -mediated autoregulation is widespread in type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems. Collectively, we unveil a new paradigm for the intrinsic regulation of CRISPR-Cas systems by natural single guides, which may facilitate the frequent horizontal transfer of these systems into new hosts that have not yet evolved their own regulatory strategies.

Section: Introduction

All immunity systems must distinguish “self” from “non-self” in order to avoid autoimmunity while still providing potent activity against diverse pathogen-associated antigens. The vertebrate adaptive immune system is a tightly regulated cellular network that undergoes spatiotemporal activation and expansion in response to novel or remembered antigens ( Gasteiger and Rudensky, 2014 24. Gasteiger, G. ∙ Rudensky, A.Y. Interactions between innate and adaptive lymphocytes Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :631-639 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with immunological memory of foreign nucleic acids, thereby protecting their prokaryotic hosts from invasive agents like viruses ( Barrangou et al., 2007 2. Barrangou, R. ∙ Fremaux, C. ∙ Deveau, H. ... CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes Science. 2007; 315 :1709-1712 Crossref Scopus (4555) PubMed Google Scholar ), plasmids ( Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008 47. Marraffini, L.A. ∙ Sontheimer, E.J. CRISPR interference limits horizontal gene transfer in staphylococci by targeting DNA Science. 2008; 322 :1843-1845 Crossref Scopus (1348) PubMed Google Scholar ), and integrative and conjugative elements ( Zhang et al., 2013 84. Zhang, Q. ∙ Rho, M. ∙ Tang, H. ... CRISPR-Cas systems target a diverse collection of invasive mobile genetic elements in human microbiomes Genome Biol. 2013; 14 :R40 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). How CRISPR-Cas immune systems are regulated within their single-celled hosts is not well understood.
Immunological memory is encoded within CRISPR loci as short, roughly 30 bp DNA “spacers,” which are derived from segments of foreign nucleic acids ( Barrangou et al., 2007 2. Barrangou, R. ∙ Fremaux, C. ∙ Deveau, H. ... CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes Science. 2007; 315 :1709-1712 Crossref Scopus (4555) PubMed Google Scholar ). These spacers are located within CRISPR arrays between similarly sized repeating sequences or “repeats” ( Mojica and Rodriguez-Valera, 2016 53. Mojica, F.J. ∙ Rodriguez-Valera, F. The discovery of CRISPR in archaea and bacteria FEBS J. 2016; 283 :3162-3169 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRISPR immunity occurs in three stages. During “adaptation,” spacers are acquired from foreign agents and incorporated into the CRISPR array at the end proximal to a conserved “leader” sequence, causing the duplication of the leader-proximal repeat ( Barrangou et al., 2007 2. Barrangou, R. ∙ Fremaux, C. ∙ Deveau, H. ... CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes Science. 2007; 315 :1709-1712 Crossref Scopus (4555) PubMed Google Scholar ). During “biogenesis,” the CRISPR array is transcribed as one long precursor CRISPR RNA ( pre-crRNA ), which is cleaved within repeats to produce individual CRISPR RNAs ( crRNAs ), each containing a single spacer ( Brouns et al., 2008 7.

Finally, during “interference,” crRNAs direct effector Cas proteins to matching foreign targets ( Gasiunas et al., 2012 23. Gasiunas, G. ∙ Barrangou, R. ∙ Horvath, P. ...

Rev. 2015; 39 :442-463 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). The type II-A CRISPR-Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes encodes four cas genes, expressed as a single operon ( Figure 1 A). While all Cas proteins are required for adaptation ( Heler et al., 2015 31. Heler, R. ∙ Samai, P. ∙ Modell, J.W. ... Cas9 specifies functional viral targets during CRISPR-Cas adaptation Nature. 2015; 519 :199-202 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ), Cas9 alone performs interference by introducing double-strand breaks into crRNA -specified DNA targets or “protospacers”( Garneau et al., 2010 22.

Cas9 targeting requires a 5′-NGG-3′ protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) ( Deveau et al., 2008 14. Deveau, H. ∙ Barrangou, R. ∙ Garneau, J.E. ... Phage response to CRISPR-encoded resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190 :1390-1400 Crossref Scopus (991) PubMed Google Scholar ; Horvath et al., 2008 35.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190 :1401-1412 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is absent in the spacer-adjacent repeats within the CRISPR array, thus preventing the CRISPR system from recognizing its own spacers as foreign targets.
In addition to the pre-crRNA , the S. pyogenes CRISPR-Cas system harbors a second non-coding RNA, the tracrRNA , which functions during all three stages of CRISPR immunity ( Deltcheva et al., 2011 13. Deltcheva, E. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Sharma, C.M. ... CRISPR RNA maturation by trans-encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III Nature. 2011; 471 :602-607 Crossref Scopus (1960) PubMed Google Scholar ; Heler et al., 2015 31. Heler, R. ∙ Samai, P. ∙ Modell, J.W. ... Cas9 specifies functional viral targets during CRISPR-Cas adaptation Nature. 2015; 519 :199-202 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). While its role during adaptation is unclear, during biogenesis, tracrRNA base pairs with repeat-derived sequences within the pre-crRNA , and the tracrRNA:pre-crRNA duplex is then cleaved by the host factor RNaseIII within each repeat, producing individual crRNAs and a processed tracrRNA ( tracr-P ) ( Deltcheva et al., 2011 13. Deltcheva, E. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Sharma, C.M. ... CRISPR RNA maturation by trans-encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III Nature. 2011; 471 :602-607 Crossref Scopus (1960) PubMed Google Scholar ). During interference, the mature targeting complex (Cas9: tracr-P:crRNA ) facilitates target recognition and cleavage. In S. pyogenes , the tracrRNA is transcribed from two promoters producing a long ( tracr-L ) and short ( tracr-S ) form, both of which contain the RNaseIII processing site ( Figures 1 A and 1B) ( Deltcheva et al., 2011 13. Deltcheva, E. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Sharma, C.M. ... CRISPR RNA maturation by trans-encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III Nature. 2011; 471 :602-607 Crossref Scopus (1960) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because tracr-S alone can mediate crRNA biogenesis and interference in vivo and in vitro , it is unclear what role tracr-L plays or why two tracrRNA forms are produced.
Several studies have demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas expression can be regulated in response to extracellular and intracellular cues ( Patterson et al., 2017 57.

Paradoxically, however, few CRISPR loci—and no type II loci—encode dedicated transcription factors.
Here, we show that tracr-L folds into a natural single-guide RNA that directs Cas9 to transcriptionally silence CRISPR-Cas expression. Repression prevents autoimmunity but at the cost of reduced immunity to phage, demonstrating the critical importance of tracr-L regulation. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism of CRISPR-Cas autoregulation and suggests that transcriptional regulation by Cas9 is more prevalent than previously thought.

Section: Results

We initially sought to identify bacterial genes involved in CRISPR-Cas immunity through an unbiased genetic screen. In our model system, Staphylococcus aureus cells that do not encode a native CRISPR-Cas system harbor the S. pyogenes type II CRISPR-Cas system on a medium or low-copy plasmid ( Heler et al., 2015 31. Heler, R. ∙ Samai, P. ∙ Modell, J.W. ... Cas9 specifies functional viral targets during CRISPR-Cas adaptation Nature. 2015; 519 :199-202 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). The S. aureus host provides genetic tractability, an assortment of well-characterized phages, and a compatible cellular environment for the S. pyogenes CRISPR-Cas system. Within this heterologous system, we performed Tn-seq ( van Opijnen et al., 2009 75. van Opijnen, T. ∙ Bodi, K.L. ∙ Camilli, A. Tn-seq: high-throughput parallel sequencing for fitness and genetic interaction studies in microorganisms Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :767-772 Crossref Scopus (643) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify transposon disruptions that enhanced CRISPR-Cas immunity. Cells harboring a “naive” CRISPR-Cas system, containing a single repeat and no spacers, were mutagenized with Tn917 ( Tomich et al., 1979 73. Tomich, P.K. ∙ An, F.Y. ∙ Clewell, D.B. A transposon (Tn917) in Streptococcus faecalis that exhibits enhanced transposition during induction of drug resistance Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1979; 43 :1217-1221 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and infected with bacteriophage φNM4γ4 ( Heler et al., 2015 31. Heler, R. ∙ Samai, P. ∙ Modell, J.W. ... Cas9 specifies functional viral targets during CRISPR-Cas adaptation Nature. 2015; 519 :199-202 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). To our surprise, the transposon insertions that most strongly promoted survival were within the CRISPR locus itself, spanning the 5′ end and promoter of tracr-L ( Figures 1 B and S1 A; Table S1 ).
To determine whether disruption of tracr-L enhances CRISPR immunity, we constructed a naive CRISPR-Cas plasmid with a 52 bp deletion spanning the promoter and 19 nucleotides at the 5′ end of tracr-L , generating Δ tracr-L ( Figure 1 B). Strikingly, Δ tracr-L significantly enhances immunity to φNM4γ4 by roughly 30-fold compared to a representative transposon insertion ( tracr-L::Tn ) or a previously identified hyper-adapting mutant ( hcas9 ) ( Heler et al., 2017 32. Heler, R. ∙ Wright, A.V. ∙ Vucelja, M. ... Mutations in Cas9 Enhance the Rate of Acquisition of Viral Spacer Sequences during the CRISPR-Cas Immune Response Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 :168-175 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by over 3,000-fold relative to the wild-type system ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 B). We recapitulated the Δ tracr-L immunity phenotype with an inactivating single nucleotide mutation in the tracr-L promoter ( Figures S1 C and S1D), and we confirmed that enhanced immunity was not due to a change in φNM4γ4 infectivity in Δ tracr-L cells ( Figure S1 E). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the CRISPR array in φNM4γ4-infected cells revealed that Δ tracr-L increased the abundance of cells with newly acquired spacers but not the distribution of those spacers within the φNM4γ4 genome ( Figures S1 F–S1H). Finally, we confirmed that Δ tracr-L enhanced immunity to another phage, φNM2γ1 ( Figure S1 I).
To test whether expression of tracr-L in trans can complement the Δ tracr-L phenotype, we cloned the tracrRNA locus onto a second plasmid and introduced two T > C mutations in nucleotides 71 and 76 of tracr-L , which constitute critical residues in the −10 promoter element of P tracr-S ( Figure S1 D), effectively eliminating tracr-S expression ( Figure S1 J). Expression of the double mutant, hereafter referred to as tracr-L ∗ , restored low levels of immunity to Δ tracr-L cells ( Figures 1 E and S1 K), indicating that (1) Δ tracr-L is a loss-of-function allele and (2) tracr-L inhibits CRISPR immunity.
We next sought to determine whether the enhanced immunity of Δ tracr-L was due to increased rates of CRISPR adaptation, biogenesis, and/or interference. To test adaptation independently of subsequent steps, we performed two distinct spacer acquisition assays in the absence of phage: (1) we measured spacer acquisition of a defined dsDNA substrate that was electroporated into cells ( Figure 2 A) and (2) we overexpressed the adaptation genes and measured the abundance of spacers acquired from the chromosome and resident plasmid ( Figure S2 A). In each case, Δ tracr-L cells showed elevated adaptation rates compared to the wild type ( Figures 2 B and S2 B), together indicating that tracr-L impairs spacer acquisition.
To determine whether tracr-L also inhibits CRISPR biogenesis and/or interference, we programmed wild-type or Δ tracr-L CRISPR loci with a spacer targeting φNM4γ4 and tested phage defense. On a medium-copy plasmid, the wild-type and Δ tracr-L systems both provide robust defense ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and S2 C). However, on a low-copy plasmid, Δ tracr-L cells significantly outperformed the wild type ( Figures 2 C, 2E, and S2 D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that tracr-L negatively regulates CRISPR-Cas adaptation as well as biogenesis and/or interference.
tracr-L could inhibit CRISPR immunity by affecting the levels or activity of one or more CRISPR-Cas components. Indeed, in the absence of tracr-L , the levels of tracr-S , tracr-P , and processed crRNAs were all dramatically enhanced ( Figure 3 A). In addition, cas gene mRNAs were induced by 30- to 50-fold ( Figures 3 B and S2 E), and Cas9 protein levels showed a corresponding increase by western blot ( Figure 3 C). Induction of CRISPR-Cas components in Δ tracr-L cells was observed whether the CRISPR array contained a single repeat or the native six spacer CRISPR array from S. pyogenes strain SF370 ( Figure S2 F). Complementation of Δ tracr-L by expression of tracr-L from a second plasmid restored low levels of CRISPR-Cas components ( Figures 3 A–3C). In the tracr-L::Tn mutant, tracr-L and Cas9 levels were intermediate between the wild type and Δ tracr-L ( Figure S2 G), indicating that the transposon insertion disrupted but did not eliminate P tracr-L activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that tracr-L inhibits the expression of all CRISPR-Cas coding and non-coding RNAs.
We next asked whether tracr-L downregulates CRISPR-Cas RNA levels by transcriptionally repressing any of the system’s four promoters ( Figure 1 A). Cells expressing cas9 and wild-type tracrRNA but no CRISPR array or other cas genes were transformed with a second plasmid harboring a transcriptional GFP fusion to each CRISPR-Cas promoter. Compared to an empty vector, cells expressing cas9 and tracrRNA inhibited P cas activity by roughly 50-fold but had no effect on the other promoters ( Figure 4 A). Inhibition of P cas -GFP was not observed in cells expressing cas9 and tracr-S ( Figure S3 A) or cas9 alone ( Figure S3 B) indicating that tracr-L is specifically required for P cas repression.
To confirm that repression of P cas requires Cas9, we combined a plasmid expressing tracrRNA and a cas9 nonsense mutant with the P cas -GFP reporter. Indeed, P cas repression required Cas9 ( Figure S3 C) although tracrRNAs were undetectable in cas9 -null mutants ( Figure S3 D), likely because they are protected from degradation by Cas9 protein. To confirm that Cas9 and tracr-L are sufficient to form a repressive complex on P cas , we performed an EMSA with purified Cas9, in vitro -transcribed tracr-L , and P cas target DNA. Indeed, Cas9: tracr-L bound P cas with an affinity of ∼1.6 nM, considerably tighter than the nonspecific affinity of Cas9 alone for P cas or Cas9: tracr-L for a non-targeted control dsDNA ( Figures 4 B, S4 A, and S4B).
Strikingly, inspection of P cas revealed an 11-nucleotide match between the 5′ end of tracr-L and a region 2 bp downstream of the P cas transcriptional start site (TSS) with a 5′-NGG-3′ PAM ( Figures 4 C, S3 E, and S3F). Furthermore, while Cas9 cleaves DNA targets that match the 20 spacer-derived nucleotides with a given processed crRNA ( Figure 4 D), shorter match lengths of up to 16 base pairs allow stable target binding but prevent cleavage ( Bikard et al., 2013 4. Bikard, D. ∙ Jiang, W. ∙ Samai, P. ... Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :7429-7437 Crossref Scopus (883) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sternberg et al., 2015 70.

Ratner, H.K. ∙ Escalera-Maurer, A. ∙ Le Rhun, A. ... Catalytically Active Cas9 Mediates Transcriptional Interference to Facilitate Bacterial Virulence Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :498-510.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether this sequence match contributes to repression, we individually mutated bases within the putative target site on the P cas -GFP reporter plasmid. Repression of P cas was abolished in PAM mutants and greatly reduced in mutants of the 9 bases at the 3′ end of the 11 bp target site ( Figures 4 E and S3 G). Together, our results are consistent with a model in which the 5′ end of tracr-L directs Cas9 to bind its own promoter and repress transcription of the cas gene operon.
Key functional domains of tracr-P have been well defined, including two segments that base pair with the crRNA to form the upper and lower stems of the guide RNA duplex ( Figure 4 D) ( Briner et al., 2014 6. Briner, A.E. ∙ Donohoue, P.D. ∙ Gomaa, A.A. ... Guide RNA functional modules direct Cas9 activity and orthogonality Mol. Cell. 2014; 56 :333-339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, nothing is known about domains that are specific to tracr-L . To probe the determinants of tracr-L repression, we generated a tiled set of 5 nt mutations in the tracr-L -specific 5′ region as well as targeted mutations in the functional domains of tracr-P . As expected, mutations in the nexus and bulge, tracrRNA regions critical for Cas9 activity, alleviated repression of P cas ( Figure 4 F) and destabilized tracr-L ( Figure S3 H), likely due to an inability to bind Cas9. Mutations in the 11 nt P cas -matching sequence similarly blocked repression, consistent with our hypothesis that this region guides tracr-L to its target. Curiously, mutations in the crRNA -binding upper and lower stems also inhibited tracr-L repression and destabilized the tracrRNA ( Figures 4 F and S3 H). This was surprising because tracr-L -mediated repression of P cas occurred in the absence of crRNA ( Figure 4 A), indicating that the upper and lower stems of tracr-L are not occupied by their cognate crRNA residues in the Cas9: tracr-L repressor complex. We noticed, however, that the 12 nucleotides just downstream of the P cas -targeting region of tracr-L almost perfectly mimic those at the 5′ end of the crRNA repeat, suggesting that tracr-L could fold in on itself to reconstitute the upper and lower stems ( Figure 4 C). Consistent with this hypothesis, the crRNA mimicking residues were also essential for repression and stability ( Figures 4 F and S3 H). These results suggested that tracr-L could form a natural single-guide RNA in which the P cas -targeting region takes the place of the crRNA spacer and the upper and lower stems are formed intramolecularly.
In the putative single-guide tracr-L structure, residues 14–19 and 113–118 base pair to form the lower stem, and residues 22–25 and 105–108 form the upper stem. Consistent with this model, and the importance of these stems for Cas9 activity, 5 nt mutations in any of these four segments that would disrupt stem formation also disrupt tracr-L repression ( Figure 4 F). We generated a construct in which both strands of the putative lower stem are simultaneously mutated to their complement, which should restore base pairing potential. Indeed, high levels of repression were observed in the double mutant as well as a compensatory mutant in both upper and lower stems ( Briner et al., 2014 6. Briner, A.E. ∙ Donohoue, P.D. ∙ Gomaa, A.A. ... Guide RNA functional modules direct Cas9 activity and orthogonality Mol. Cell. 2014; 56 :333-339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S3 I–S3K), supporting our model of intramolecular stem formation. Another feature of the natural single guide is the large 79 nt “upper stem extension,” which takes the place of an 8 nt duplex or 5′-GAAA-3′ tetraloop in the crRNA and synthetic sgRNA , respectively ( Figures S7 A–S7D). We replaced the entire 79 nt segment with a 5′-GAAA-3′ tetraloop and found that repression of P cas was maintained ( Figure S3 I), suggesting that this region is dispensable for tracr-L repression.
To confirm that the tracr-L target is specified by the 11 nt P cas -matching region, we mutated this region to match 11 bp sites within artificial promoters unrelated to P cas . Whether these targets were upstream ( Figure S4 C) or downstream ( Figure 5 A) from the transcriptional start site, promoter activity was significantly reduced in the presence of the reprogrammed constructs but not the native tracr-L . We next varied the tracr-L match length and found that increasing complementarity from 11 to 13 or 15 bp further reduced promoter activity ( Figure 5 B). Compared to nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) programmed with a canonical sgRNA (containing a 20 bp spacer) specifying the same target site, repression with the 11 bp or 15 bp tracr-L was 4- or 1.7-fold weaker, respectively ( Figure S4 D). Notably, we could not readily transform cells harboring tracr-L constructs with GFP reporter plasmids containing target matches longer than 16 bp ( Figure S4 E) due to Cas9 cleavage above this threshold ( Figure 5 C), consistent with previous studies using other guides ( Ratner et al., 2019 63. Ratner, H.K. ∙ Escalera-Maurer, A. ∙ Le Rhun, A. ... Catalytically Active Cas9 Mediates Transcriptional Interference to Facilitate Bacterial Virulence Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :498-510.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bikard et al., 2013 4. Bikard, D. ∙ Jiang, W. ∙ Samai, P. ... Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :7429-7437 Crossref Scopus (883) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sternberg et al., 2015 70. Sternberg, S.H. ∙ LaFrance, B. ∙ Kaplan, M. ... Conformational control of DNA target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9 Nature. 2015; 527 :110-113 Crossref Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, our results suggest that tracr-L evolved as a natural single guide that directs Cas9 to bind but not cleave P cas and thereby maintain low levels of Cas operon expression.
We next investigated whether the immunosuppressive effects of tracr-L were solely due to repression of P cas . We constructed a plasmid encoding a naive CRISPR-Cas system with a PAM mutation (P cas NGC ) that renders P cas insensitive to tracr-L repression ( Figure 4 E). The P c as NGC strain displayed high levels of phage resistance comparable to the Δ tracr-L mutant ( Figure 6 A), indicating that transcriptional repression is the primary if not sole inhibitory function of tracr-L . As expected, despite the presence of tracr-L , P cas NGC cells overexpress Cas9 at Δ tracr-L levels ( Figure S5 A). Interestingly, this construct also phenocopies Δ tracr-L with high levels of tracr-S , tracr-P , and crRNA , none of which are transcribed from P cas ( Figure S5 A). To ask whether tracrRNAs and crRNAs are stabilized by higher levels of Cas9 in the P c as NGC strain, we overexpressed Cas9 in cells harboring a wild-type CRISPR system and found that tracr-S , tracr-P , and crRNAs were indeed all upregulated ( Figure S5 B). These results suggest that tracr-L serves as a master regulator for the entire CRISPR-Cas system by (1) directly controlling the protein-coding cas operon through P cas and (2) indirectly controlling tracrRNA and crRNA levels by regulating Cas9 abundance.
We next asked whether tracr-L is a specialized transcriptional repressor or whether, like tracr-S , it can also bind crRNAs . Cells expressing tracr-L as the only tracrRNA were capable of performing interference ( Figures 6 B, S5 C, and S5D), albeit less well than those expressing tracr-S ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Nonetheless, these results indicate that tracr-L can hybridize with crRNAs in order to interfere with viral targets specified by the crRNA spacer.
Once bound, crRNAs occupy the upper and lower stems of tracr-L preventing formation of the natural single guide ( Figure S7 E). We therefore wondered whether crRNA expression interferes with tracr-L -mediated repression of P cas . To explore this possibility, we measured Cas9 levels in cells harboring a CRISPR-Cas system with no CRISPR array, a single repeat, or two repeats surrounding one of the six spacers from the natural S. pyogenes SF370 CRISPR array. We observed low Cas9 levels in cells without a CRISPR array, and the presence of a single repeat did not enhance Cas9 expression, indicating that a naive pre-crRNA did not appreciably interfere with tracr-L repression; however, Cas9 levels increased in the presence of any single spacer and in the 6-spacer S. pyogenes CRISPR array ( Figure S5 G; Figure S2 F). crRNAs could also influence P cas expression by hybridizing with tracr-S and sequestering Cas9 away from tracr-L . Consistent with this possibility, Cas9 levels in a naive CRISPR-Cas system increased after the introduction of a non-targeting sgRNA on a second plasmid ( Figure S5 H). These results suggest the presence of a regulatory circuit in which crRNAs provide feedback through tracr-L to affect P cas expression.
Our results indicate that, in wild-type cells, tracr-L maintains the CRISPR-Cas system in a lowly active state. We wondered whether constitutive expression of CRISPR-Cas components could cause autoimmunity, stemming from adaptation and subsequent interference against the bacterial chromosome or resident plasmids. Indeed, in the absence of phage, we observed more self-targeting spacers in Δ tracr-L cells relative to the wild type and hcas9 , with many derived from the chromosome terminus, a known hotspot for spacer acquisition in type II CRISPR-Cas systems ( Modell et al., 2017 52. Modell, J.W. ∙ Jiang, W. ∙ Marraffini, L.A. CRISPR-Cas systems exploit viral DNA injection to establish and maintain adaptive immunity Nature. 2017; 544 :101-104 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S6 A–S6C). To gauge whether constitutive CRISPR-Cas expression causes a growth defect, we competed wild-type and Δ tracr-L cells and found that after 1 and 2 days, the number of Δ tracr-L cells dropped to 33% and 3% of their original number, respectively ( Figure 6 C). Together, these results suggest that tracr-L could repress the CRISPR system to avoid autoimmunity while allowing enough expression for some level of viral surveillance ( Figures 2 B–2E).
We next explored whether tracr-L represses P cas in its native S. pyogenes host through two parallel approaches: (1) we deleted tracr-L in the S. pyogenes chromosome, and (2) we depleted tracr-L by expressing an antisense RNA. In both cases, tracr-S , tracr-P , and Cas9 protein were significantly elevated in the absence of tracr-L ( Figures 6 D and S6 D) indicating that tracr-L controls CRISPR-Cas expression in S. pyogenes . Next, we asked whether P cas could be de-repressed to induce CRISPR-Cas expression when needed, for instance, during a phage infection. We infected S. pyogenes cells with phage A25 but found no reproducible changes in Cas9 protein levels at any multiplicity of infection (MOI) tested ( Figure S6 E). Alternatively, we hypothesized that cells could induce CRISPR-Cas expression in response to environmental changes that forebode a phage attack. Growth at 25°C mildly enhanced both Cas9 and tracr-L expression relative to 37°C ( Figure S6 F), similar to what we observed for tracr-L -independent mechanisms of Cas9 induction ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Conversely, increases in Cas9 levels were accompanied by decreases in tracr-L during growth into late stationary phase ( Figure S6 F), suggesting that, in this case, Cas9 induction could be driven by de-repression of P cas by tracr-L .
We next investigated whether tracr-L -mediated repression of P cas is found in other type II-A systems. We examined 80 CRISPR-Cas loci from Streptococci , Listeria , and Lactobacilli ( Faure et al., 2019 18. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ... Comparative genomics and evolution of trans-activating RNAs in Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems RNA Biol. 2019; 16 :435-448 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that 34 (43%) contain a putative tracr-L ( tracr-L + ) ( Figure 7 A; Table S2 ). To determine whether these tracr-L + loci encode bona fide repressors, we cloned S. agalactiae strain A909 tracrRNA and cas9 onto an S. aureus plasmid and measured cas9 mRNA levels by qPCR. Deletion of the putative tracr-L or introduction of a P cas PAM mutation enhanced cas9 expression by 20- to 30-fold, suggesting that S. agalactiae tracr-L is a conserved P cas repressor ( Figure 7 B).
tracr-L + genomes are distributed intermittently throughout the II-A tree, suggesting frequent loss or gain events. Curiously, while the lower stems and PAMs showed near perfect conservation among tracr-L + loci, the identity of the matching sequence varied and its length ranged from 11 to 15 bp, indicating covariation over evolutionary timescales between the tracr-L and P cas targeting determinants ( Figure 7 A, Table S5 ). Within tracr-L - loci, the intergenic space between tracr-S and cas9 was on average roughly 200 bp shorter than in tracr-L + loci ( Figure 7 C) owing to deletions that removed the targeting and/or targeted sites ( Table S5 ). In some cases, we observed tracr-L - loci with intergenic lengths comparable to tracr-L + that contained one or more mismatches within the seed but retained perfect PAMs and lower stems ( Table S5 ). Our data suggest that similar seed mutants can retain intermediate levels of repression ( Figure 4 E), while deletions of targeting determinants likely result in complete de-repression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that tracr-L -mediated regulation of P cas is common in type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems.

Section: Discussion

Since the earliest characterization of the S. pyogenes type II-A CRISPR-Cas system ( Deltcheva et al., 2011 13. Deltcheva, E. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Sharma, C.M. ... CRISPR RNA maturation by trans-encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III Nature. 2011; 471 :602-607 Crossref Scopus (1960) PubMed Google Scholar ), it has remained a mystery why two tracrRNA isoforms are expressed given that the short form is sufficient to mediate pre-crRNA processing and Cas9 targeting and cleavage ( Jinek et al., 2012 38. Jinek, M. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Fonfara, I. ... A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity Science. 2012; 337 :816-821 Crossref Scopus (11706) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we report that long-form tracrRNAs form natural single guides that direct Cas9 to bind and transcriptionally repress the cas operon promoter ( Figure 4 C; Figure S7 ). The S. pyogenes Cas9: tracr-L complex binds P cas with a K d of ∼1.6 nM ( Figure S4 B), an affinity that is slightly lower than published values for dCas9: sgRNA ( Sternberg et al., 2014 69. Sternberg, S.H. ∙ Redding, S. ∙ Jinek, M. ... DNA interrogation by the CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 Nature. 2014; 507 :62-67 Crossref Scopus (1399) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jinek et al., 2012 38. Jinek, M. ∙ Chylinski, K. ∙ Fonfara, I. ... A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity Science. 2012; 337 :816-821 Crossref Scopus (11706) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mekler et al., 2017 51. Mekler, V. ∙ Minakhin, L. ∙ Severinov, K. Mechanism of duplex DNA destabilization by RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease during target interrogation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :5443-5448 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), perhaps owing to the shorter targeting sequence (11 versus 20 bp).
The wild-type CRISPR-Cas system is thus maintained in a low activity state that is sufficient to surveil and destroy remembered threats ( Figures 2 C–2E) but adapts poorly to unrecognized phages ( Figures 1 C and 2B). De-repression of the system results in a roughly 50-fold increase in CRISPR-Cas components ( Figure 3 ) and a 3,000-fold increase in immunization rates against an unrecognized phage ( Figures 1 C–1E). As with many immune systems, this hyperactivity comes at a price; cells with de-repressed systems acquire many more autoimmune spacers ( Figures S1 F and S1G), and the substrate preference is altered with a higher percentage of new spacers coming from the bacterial chromosome relative to plasmid and phage sources ( Figures S6 A–S6C). We propose that autoimmune spacer acquisition contributes to the growth defect in cells lacking tracr-L ( Figure 6 C), which could be further exacerbated by the metabolic burden of constitutive CRISPR-Cas expression and off-target cleavage by Cas9 at high concentrations. S. pyogenes therefore joins a small but growing list of prokaryotes that employ an off or dimmer switch to buffer against the deleterious effects of CRISPR-Cas overexpression ( Patterson et al., 2017 57. Patterson, A.G. ∙ Yevstigneyeva, M.S. ∙ Fineran, P.C. Regulation of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2017; 37 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Can physiological stimuli trigger CRISPR-Cas induction as needed by the bacterial host? One logical candidate stimulus is the phage infection itself. The archaeal S. solfataricus type I-A CRISPR-Cas locus encodes the only other known CRISPR-Cas autoregulator, a Cas-encoded transcription factor Csa3b that binds and represses P cas ( Liu et al., 2015 45. Liu, T. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Wang, X. ... Transcriptional regulator-mediated activation of adaptation genes triggers CRISPR de novo spacer acquisition Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :1044-1055 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lintner et al., 2011 44. Lintner, N.G. ∙ Frankel, K.A. ∙ Tsutakawa, S.E. ... The structure of the CRISPR-associated protein Csa3 provides insight into the regulation of the CRISPR/Cas system J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405 :939-955 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Haft et al., 2005 29. Haft, D.H. ∙ Selengut, J. ∙ Mongodin, E.F. ... A guild of 45 CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families and multiple CRISPR/Cas subtypes exist in prokaryotic genomes PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1 :e60 Crossref Scopus (817) PubMed Google Scholar ). When the Cas effector in this system is directed to a non-lytic viral target, it brings Csa3b with it resulting in de-repression of P cas ( He et al., 2017 30. He, F. ∙ Vestergaard, G. ∙ Peng, W. ... CRISPR-Cas type I-A Cascade complex couples viral infection surveillance to host transcriptional regulation in the dependence of Csa3b Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :1902-1913 PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not observe a similar induction of the S. pyogenes type II-A Cas operon following an A25 phage infection at a range of MOIs ( Figure S6 E). While other phages may provoke different outcomes, it is unclear whether a transcriptional response can keep pace with the rapid life cycle of a lytic bacteriophage compared to a non-lytic archaeal virus.
Another possibility is that the CRISPR-Cas system is induced by conditions or environments that might presage a phage threat. We observed a modest increase in Cas9 expression during late stationary phase ( Figure S6 F), when dense bacterial populations could provide ample targets for phage predation. In this case, we also observed a decrease in tracr-L suggesting that Cas9 induction could be driven by de-repression of P cas . In contrast, during growth at 25°C, Cas9 expression increased in tandem with tracr-L , similar to what we observed for modes of Cas9 induction that do not involve loss of tracr-L ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Increasing levels of Cas9: tracr-L could provide negative feedback to P cas , thereby maintaining Cas9 expression within an acceptable window. We note that many bacterial ribonucleases similarly autoregulate their expression, often by cleaving their own mRNA products ( Bechhofer and Deutscher, 2019 3. Bechhofer, D.H. ∙ Deutscher, M.P. Bacterial ribonucleases and their roles in RNA metabolism Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2019; 54 :242-300 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). tracr-L hybridizes with the P cas template strand so regulation of the mRNA is unlikely. Regardless, a critical role of tracr-L may be to maintain Cas9 homeostasis and thereby buffer cells against stochastic or regulated changes in Cas9 expression. Further studies will be required to identify the full set of signals and mechanisms that regulate Cas9, either via or independently of tracr-L .
De-repression of tracr-L could also occur through genetic changes within the targeting elements. Single mutations in tracr-L (targeting seed, lower and upper stems) or P cas (target seed, PAM), encompassing roughly 30 nucleotides in total, partially, or fully relieve repression ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Given bacterial mutation rates ( Chevallereau et al., 2019 11. Chevallereau, A. ∙ Meaden, S. ∙ van Houte, S. ... The effect of bacterial mutation rate on the evolution of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2019; 374 :20180094 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), as many as one in a million cells are expected to be CRISPR-Cas overproducers, or 10–100 per colony. In a bacterial population, wild-type cells could be spared from autoimmunity, while rare CRISPR-Cas overexpressing mutants could serve as sentinels in case of a phage attack. Seed mutations in the tracr-L targeting sequence could function as evolutionary stepping stones, where a second compensatory mutation in P cas , or vice versa, could restore repression as needed. This might provide an explanation for the covariation we observe between the targeting and targeted sites throughout the type II-A tracr-L tree.
t racr-L autoregulators are located throughout the type II-A CRISPR-Cas tree in 43% of representative members ( Figure 7 A). Its intermittent absence suggests that individual strains can use or lose tracr-L according to their unique needs. In strains without tracr-L , constitutive CRISPR-Cas expression could enable survival in phage-rich environments. Alternatively, other non-canonical guide RNAs could regulate P cas in the absence of tracr-L . In the F. novicida type II-B CRISPR system, tracrRNA hybridizes with a “ scaRNA ” that, like tracr-L , reconstitutes dsRNA stem structures normally formed by the crRNA:tracrRNA duplex ( Sampson et al., 2013 66. Sampson, T.R. ∙ Saroj, S.D. ∙ Llewellyn, A.C. ... A CRISPR/Cas system mediates bacterial innate immune evasion and virulence Nature. 2013; 497 :254-257 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ratner et al., 2019 63. Ratner, H.K. ∙ Escalera-Maurer, A. ∙ Le Rhun, A. ... Catalytically Active Cas9 Mediates Transcriptional Interference to Facilitate Bacterial Virulence Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :498-510.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). The scaRNA also utilizes an 11 bp targeting sequence; however, it targets the promoter of an immunostimulatory lipoprotein in the bacterial genome. Whether scaRNAs can target promoters within the CRISPR-Cas system and conversely whether tracr-L can target promoters elsewhere in the bacterial chromosome are open questions.
The composition of the CRISPR array can also affect Cas9 expression ( Figure S5 G). We hypothesize that crRNAs affect the repressive potential of tracr-L by (1) binding to tracr-L and preventing formation of the single-guide ( Figure S7 E) and/or (2) binding to tracr-S and sequestering Cas9 away from tracr-L ( Figure S5 H). crRNAs with spacers that bind the tracrRNAs better or worse could therefore differentially regulate P cas . Notably, the CRISPR array is transcribed from its own promoter providing another entry point for system-wide regulation. Furthermore, larger CRISPR arrays with more repeats provide more binding sites for the sequestration and/or processing of tracr-L . Longer arrays should therefore enhance CRISPR-Cas expression, supported by the higher baseline levels of Cas expression we observe in the native S. pyogenes 6-spacer array relative to a single repeat ( Figure S2 F). Bacterial populations acquire a wide variety of spacers during a phage infection ( Heler et al., 2015 31. Heler, R. ∙ Samai, P. ∙ Modell, J.W. ...

Commun. 2013; 4 :1430 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the most recently acquired spacers are the most highly expressed ( McGinn and Marraffini, 2016 49. McGinn, J. ∙ Marraffini, L.A. CRISPR-Cas Systems Optimize Their Immune Response by Specifying the Site of Spacer Integration Mol.

CRISPR RNA maturation by trans-encoded small RNA and host factor RNase III Nature. 2011; 471 :602-607 Crossref Scopus (1960) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to cleavage efficiency ( Xu et al., 2015 80. Xu, H. ∙ Xiao, T. ∙ Chen, C.H. ... Sequence determinants of improved CRISPR sgRNA design Genome Res. 2015; 25 :1147-1157 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ) and target location ( Modell et al., 2017 52. Modell, J.W. ∙ Jiang, W. ∙ Marraffini, L.A. CRISPR-Cas systems exploit viral DNA injection to establish and maintain adaptive immunity Nature. 2017; 544 :101-104 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Strotskaya et al., 2017 71.

The action of Escherichia coli CRISPR-Cas system on lytic bacteriophages with different lifestyles and development strategies Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :1946-1957 PubMed Google Scholar ), our results unveil CRISPR-Cas expression as a new criterion for spacer selection and maintenance.
The emerging literature on CRISPR-Cas regulation in bacteria focuses on type I systems, which are controlled by transcription factors or chaperones encoded outside the CRISPR-Cas locus ( Patterson et al., 2017 57. Patterson, A.G. ∙ Yevstigneyeva, M.S. ∙ Fineran, P.C. Regulation of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2017; 37 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results provide the first example of an intrinsic CRISPR-Cas regulator within a bacterial host. We believe that intrinsic regulators like tracr-L could facilitate the rampant horizontal transfer of CRISPR-Cas systems in nature by dampening autoimmunity upon delivery and allowing the new bacterial host to tune CRISPR-Cas9 expression to meet its needs, through transient induction or mutation of the control elements.
Our results will also inform new generations of Cas9 tools. t racr-L can be reprogrammed to target promoters of interest and multiplexed with canonical sgRNAs in order to simultaneously cleave one site while transcriptionally repressing another. Alternatively, tracr-L autoregulation of P cas could mitigate off-target effects by buffering Cas9 expression levels. Furthermore, a better understanding of how tracr-L is naturally regulated will facilitate the development of inducible and reversible single guides. As the list of sequenced microbial genomes grows, so does the catalog of novel Cas9 orthologs, each with the possibility of new PAMs and unique cleavage activities. Our results suggest that many of these genomes might be worth a closer look for the blueprints of natural single guides.

Staphylococcus aureus cells were grown at 37°C, unless otherwise indicated, in Bacto Brain-Heart infusion (BHI) broth with shaking at 220 RPM. During outgrowths from stationary phase preceding phage treatments, BHI was supplemented with calcium chloride at 5 mM to allow phage adsorption and with 1 mM IPTG to allow expression from P sparc2 when necessary. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations for strain construction and plasmid maintenance in S. aureus : tetracycline, 5 μg/mL; chloramphenicol, 10 μg/mL; erythromycin, 10 μg/mL; spectinomycin, 250 μg/mL. Streptococcus pyogenes cells were grown at 37°C, unless otherwise indicated, in Bacto Brain-Heart infusion (BHI) broth without shaking. During outgrowths from stationary phase preceding phage treatments, BHI was supplemented with calcium chloride at 5 mM to allow phage adsorption. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations for strain construction and plasmid maintenance in S. pyogenes: chloramphenicol, 3 μg/mL.
Staphylococcus aureus phages (φNM4γ4, φNM2γ1) were amplified on RN4220 and stored in BHI at 4°C. Streptococcus pyogenes phage A25 was amplified on strain C13, a derivative of SF370 prophage-cured strain CEM1ΔΦ ( Euler et al., 2016 17. Euler, C.W. ∙ Juncosa, B. ∙ Ryan, P.A. ... Targeted Curing of All Lysogenic Bacteriophage from Streptococcus pyogenes Using a Novel Counter-selection Technique PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0146408 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a kind gift of Andrew Varble, which has a spontaneous deletion of spacers 2-5 in its CRISPR array, including deletion of the natural spacer targeting A25, and stored in BHI at 4°C.
See Table S4 for strains, plasmids, cloning notes, and oligos used in this study.
Gibson assemblies were performed as described ( Gibson et al., 2009 25. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (6582) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 100 ng of the largest dsDNA fragment to be assembled was combined with equimolar volumes of the smaller fragment(s) and brought to 5 μL total in dH2O on ice. Samples were added to 15 μL of Gibson Assembly master mix, mixed by pipetting and incubated at 50°C for 1 hour. Samples were drop dialyzed in dH2O for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and 5 μL were electroporated into 50 μL electrocompetent RN4220 S. aureus cells.
To create a repeat-spacer-repeat CRISPR array with a defined spacer, we used a restriction digest-based cloning approach. Parent plasmids contain two CRISPR repeats flanking a 30bp sequence housing two BsaI restriction sites. 400-800 ng of the plasmid was mixed with the BsaI-HFv2 restriction enzyme (NEB, R3733S) in a 10 μL reaction volume (1 μL BsaI-HFv2 enzyme, 1 μL CutSmart buffer, plasmid + nuclease-free water to 10 μL) and incubated at 37°C for ∼8 hours. Two IDT oligos, a “top” strand with sequence 5′-AAAC-(30bp spacer)-G-3′, and a “bottom” strand with sequence 5′-AAAAC-(30bp spacer reverse complement)-3′ were phosphorylated with PNK (NEB, M0201S) in a 50 μL reaction volume (1.5 μL 100 μM top oligo, 1.5 μL 100 μM bottom oligo, 41 μL nuclease free water, 5 μL T4 PNK 5x reaction buffer, 1 μL T4 PNK) at 37°C for 30 minutes to 1 hour. After phosphorylation, oligos were annealed by adding 2.5 μL of 1M NaCl to the 50 μL reaction and incubating for 5 minutes at 98°C, then allowing the reaction to cool to room temperature (1-2 hours). The phosphorylated, annealed oligos were diluted 1:10 in nuclease-free water and ligated to the digested plasmid in a 20 μL reaction (10 μL digested plasmid, 6 μL water, 1 μL 1:10 diluted oligos, 2 μL T4 ligase buffer, 1 μL T4 DNA ligase enzyme (NEB, M0202S)) at room temperature overnight. Reactions were drop dialyzed for 1 hour in dH2O and 5 μL were transformed into electrocompetent RN4220 S. aureus cells.
To create the Δ tracr-L mutation in the native Streptococcus pyogenes host chromosome, we performed allelic exchange. The allelic exchange vector pJW854 was constructed by amplification of the pWV01-based shuttle vector pFW13 (a generous gift of Andrew Varble) using primers oJW2637/oJW2638, and insertion of left and right homology arms flanking the chloramphenicol resistance gene cat194 [Cm r ] by Gibson assembly. The left homology arm was amplified from purified Streptococcus pyogenes SF370 genomic DNA (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, QIAGEN, modified protocol described below) using primers oJW2641/oJW2642, cat194 was amplified from pAV259 (a generous gift of Andrew Varble) using primers oJW2640/oJW2639, and the right homology arm containing the 52-bp Δ tracr-L deletion mutation was amplified from pGG32_Dtr-L using primers oJW2643/oJW2644. pJW854 was first transformed into E. coli Dh5α, then isolated from 150 mL overnight culture using the GeneJET Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The purified plasmid was concentrated using ethanol precipitation and transformed into Streptococcus pyogenes strain SF370 using the electroporation protocol described below and plated onto BHI plates with chloramphenicol. After transformation, colonies were restreaked on chloramphenicol plates to reduce background and confirm antibiotic resistance. Restruck colonies were picked, lysed in 100 ul 1X PBS and PlyC (1 μg/ml final concentration), then checked for successful double recombination using PCR, primers oJW2923/oJW2924 and oJW2922/oJW2927.
1 mL of S. pyogenes overnight culture was centrifuged for 1 minute at 6000 RPM, resuspended in 1X PBS and PlyC (1 μg/ml final concentration) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After lysis, the genomic DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN).
S. pyogenes cells were made electrocompetent by diluting an overnight culture 1:20 in 150 mL and growing cells to an OD of ∼0.3, followed by centrifugation at 4000 x g at 4°C for 20 minutes. The supernatant was decanted and the cell pellet was washed with 150 mL cold 10% glycerol and pelleted at 4000 x g at 4°C for 15 minutes. This wash step was repeated once in 150 mL, then twice more in 30 mL in a 50 mL Falcon tube. The washed cell pellet was resuspended in 150 μl 10% glycerol, then separated into 50 μl aliquots. 5 μl of 500 ng/μl plasmid DNA was mixed with the electrocompetent cells, then pipetted into a pre-chilled 0.1cm cuvette (Biorad, 165-2089). The cuvette was dried with a Kimwipe then pulsed at 2.5kV/cm, 200 ohms, and 25 μF. 950 μl of pre-warmed BHI was immediately added to the cuvette and incubated at 37°C without shaking for 3 hours. After incubation, the cells were transferred into an Eppendorf tube, centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 1 min, then resuspended in 300 μl BHI and struck out onto BHI plates with the appropriate antibiotic.
To construct a transposon library in cells lacking a CRISPR system, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220 cells harboring pTV1, a temperature-sensitive plasmid containing transposon Tn917 from Streptococcus faecalis ( Tomich et al., 1979 73. Tomich, P.K. ∙ An, F.Y. ∙ Clewell, D.B. A transposon (Tn917) in Streptococcus faecalis that exhibits enhanced transposition during induction of drug resistance Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1979; 43 :1217-1221 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), were grown overnight at the permissive temperature (30°C) in BHI supplemented with chloramphenicol. The next morning, 500 μL cells were washed 1x in plain BHI and then diluted into 500 mL BHI prewarmed to the restrictive temperature (42°C) and supplemented with erythromycin, without chloramphenicol. Cells were grown at 42°C with shaking for ∼8 hours and diluted again 500 μL into 500 mL BHI/erythromycin. After an overnight growth at 42°C, cells were plated onto BHI agar plates supplemented with erythromycin and incubated overnight at 42°C. The next day, 10,000 colonies were scraped with 3 mL BHI into a Falcon tube and resuspended by pipetting and vortexing. DMSO was added to 10% and library aliquots were stored at −80°C. A second transposon library was constructed in cells harboring the CRISPR-Cas system on plasmid pJW92 as above, with tetracycline added during each step for plasmid maintenance.
Transposon library aliquots were thawed and diluted to OD = 0.05 in 20 mL (- phage experiments) or 500 mL (+ phage experiments) BHI supplemented with calcium chloride. After ∼2 hours of growth at 37°C, culture ODs were roughly 0.4-0.5, and ɸNM4γ4 was added to the + phage experiments in duplicate (CRISPR- library) or triplicate (CRISPR+ library) at MOI = 1. After 24 hours of growth, genomic DNA was prepared using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) and culture aliquots were frozen at −80°C for storage in 10% DMSO. As above, tetracycline was added in all steps for cells harboring pGG32_tetK.
To prepare NGS libraries, genomic DNA was digested with NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase (M0348) for 9 minutes, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 M EDTA (final concentration). The fragmented DNA, centered at 700bp, was then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit and end repaired using the NEBNext DNA Library Reagent Set for Illumina (E6000S). After another QIAquick PCR purification, NEBNext adapters were ligated onto the fragments and DNA in the 0.2 – 1 kb range was purified from an agarose gel with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit. Next, for each sample, a PCR was performed with a unique oligo from the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit (E7335S, Index Primers Set 1) and a universal, transposon-specific primer (oJW451). Amplicons in the 0.2 – 0.5 kb range were gel purified as before and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq using the sequencing primer oJW436. NGS analysis details are given in the Quantification and Statistical Analysis section below.
1-1.5 mL of an overnight culture, unless otherwise indicated, was pelleted and resuspended in 250 μL Buffer P1. 10-20 μL Lysostaphin (Ambi Products LLC, LSPN-50, 100 μg/mL final) was added and the cells were incubated without shaking at 37°C for ∼20 minutes. Following lysis, plasmids were isolated using the QIAGEN Spin Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's protocol, beginning with addition of P2. DNA was eluted from each column in 30 μL RNase-free water.
Electrocompetent S. aureus cells were made by washing overnight cultures twice in full-volumes of dH2O and once in a half-volume of dH2O before resuspending in 1/100 the original volume in 10% glycerol. A 60 bp amplicon from phage ɸNM4γ4 was generated using primers oJW1744 and oJW1745. This amplicon contains a single candidate protospacer with a 5′-NGG-3′ PAM, which Cas9 recognizes during spacer selection ( Heler et al., 2015 31. Heler, R. ∙ Samai, P. ∙ Modell, J.W. ... Cas9 specifies functional viral targets during CRISPR-Cas adaptation Nature. 2015; 519 :199-202 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). The amplicon was dialyzed and 50 ng were added to 50 μL of electrocompetent cells in an Eppendorf tube, mixed by pipetting and left at room temperature for 10 minutes. Cells were transferred to a 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad, 1652086) and electroporated at 1.8 kV using an Eporator (Eppendorf). Following electroporation, 1 mL BHI broth was added and the contents of the cuvette were mixed by pipetting and then transferred to an Eppendorf tube and grown for 1 hour with shaking at 220 RPM at 37°C. Plasmids were miniprepped, and spacer acquisition was monitored by a spacer-specific PCR reaction with primers oJW1833 and oJW1834. PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel run for 25 minutes at 130 V.
In this assay, overexpression of the adaptation genes cas1 , cas2 and csn2 enables spacer acquisition from the host genome and resident plasmids. Overnight cultures of S. aureus were diluted to OD = 0.04 in BHI broth supplemented with antibiotics and grown for 1 hour with shaking at 37°C. Cultures were then supplemented with anhydrotetracycline (ATc) at 0 μg/mL or 0.5 μg/mL (final concentrations). Cultures were incubated with shaking at 37°C for 2 hours and then miniprepped with a lysis step including 15 μL of Lysostaphin incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes. An enrichment PCR was performed as described below and PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel run for 27 minutes at 130 V.
For overexpression adaptation and spacer sequencing analysis we enriched for adapted CRISPR loci using an established enrichment PCR protocol ( Modell et al., 2017 52. Modell, J.W. ∙ Jiang, W. ∙ Marraffini, L.A. CRISPR-Cas systems exploit viral DNA injection to establish and maintain adaptive immunity Nature. 2017; 544 :101-104 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, CRISPR plasmids were harvested from S. aureus cells with a modified QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit protocol: bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μl P1 buffer supplemented with Lysostaphin (100 ug/ml final concentration) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 minutes followed by the standard QIAprep protocol. We used 100ng of plasmid as input for the enrichment PCR of the CRISPR locus using Phusion DNA Polymerase (Thermo) with the following primer mix: three parts oJW8 or oJW419 and one part each oJW3, oJW4 and oJW5. For spacer NGS sequencing, variants of the primer oJW8 with 3–8-bp bar codes at the 5′ end were used to distinguish experiments from each other during multiplexed high-throughput sequencing. PCRs with conventional primers were performed similarly using primers oJW1131 and oL401 with 5′ bar codes for multiplexing. Amplicons were purified with Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter) and subjected to Illumina high-throughput sequencing with the Miseq platform.
Overnight cultures of S. aureus were diluted to OD = 0.025 in BHI broth supplemented with calcium chloride and antibiotics and grown for 1 hour and 15 minutes shaking at 37°C. Cultures were normalized to the OD of the lowest culture and phage ɸNM4γ4 was added to the appropriate MOI. After inverting to mix, 150 μL of each culture were added to a flat-bottom 96-well plate (Grenier 655180), and the plate was incubated at 37°C with shaking in a TECAN Infinite F Nano+ with OD600 measurements recorded every 10 minutes for 24 hours.
100 μL of S. aureus overnight cultures were added to a 50 mL Falcon tube. 6 mL of BHI top agar (0.75% agar) supplemented with calcium chloride (5mM final concentration) was added to each tube. After swirling to mix, the cells and top agar were poured onto a BHI 1.5% agar plate and rocked gently to create a bacterial lawn. The plate was incubated for 15 - 30 minutes at RT. 3.5 μL of 8 10-fold serial dilutions of phage ɸNM4γ4 in BHI broth were spotted on top of the bacterial lawn using a multichannel pipette. After a 30 minute incubation at room temperature, the plates were moved to a 37°C incubator overnight.
200 μL of overnight cultures were spun down in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube at 6,000 rpm for one minute. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of 1X PBS and 150 μL were transferred into a clear, flat-bottomed 96-well plate (Grenier 655180). Measurements for absorbance (at 600 nm) and fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 485 nm; emission wavelength = 535 nm) were recorded (details on calculations in Quantification and Statistical Analysis).
Overnight cultures of Staphylococcus aureus harboring naive CRISPR systems with a single repeat were diluted to OD = 0.1 in BHI supplemented with calcium chloride and relevant antibiotics and grown for 1.5 hours. Cultures were normalized to the OD of the lowest culture, and phage ɸNM4γ4 was added at the specified MOIs. 150 μL of each culture was added to a clear, flat-bottom 96-well plate (Grenier 655180), and the plate was incubated at 37°C with shaking in a TECAN Infinite F Nano+. OD600 measurements were recorded every 10 minutes for 24 hours.
100 μL of overnight cultures of Staphylococcus aureus harboring naive CRISPR systems were mixed with ɸNM4γ4 at MOI = 25 and 6 mL of BHI top agar (0.75% agar) supplemented with calcium chloride and poured onto BHI agar (1.5%) plates. After 15 minutes at room temperature, plates were moved to a 37°C incubator overnight, and surviving colonies were counted. When indicated, colony PCR was performed with primers oJW154 and oJW355 to verify expansion of the CRISPR array due to spacer integration.
PCR was performed with Phusion HF DNA polymerase using 5X Phusion Green Reaction Buffer (Thermo). Each reaction contained 10 μL buffer, 4 μL dNTPs, 0.5 μL each of 100 μM forward and reverse primers, 10-50 ng template, 0.5 μL polymerase and nuclease-free water to 50 μL. Three-step cycling was performed under the following conditions: 98°C for 30 s, 34 cycles of [98°C 5 s, 45-72°C 15 s, 72°C for 30 s/kb], 72°C 10 minutes, hold at 10°C.
To extract S. aureus RNA for Northern blot, RT-qPCR, and RNA-seq analysis, 7.5E8 cells were spun down, resuspended in 150 μL 1X PBS (10X stock, Corning, 46-013-CM) and Lysostaphin (60 μg/ml final concentration), and incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes. Cells were processed from overnight cultures unless otherwise specified. To the whole cell lysate, 450 μl Trizol (Zymo, R2071) and 600 μL 200 proof ethanol were added, samples were vortexed and RNA was extracted using the Direct-Zol Miniprep Plus spin column according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Zymo, R2071). Samples were eluted in 50 μL Ambion RNase-free water (ThermoFisher, AM9937). To extract S. pyogenes RNA for Northern blot and RT-qPCR analyses, 7.5E8 cells from an overnight culture were spun down, resuspended in 150 μl 1X PBS and PlyC (1 μg/ml final concentration), and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. After lysis, the RNA extraction protocol was followed as detailed above.
Total RNA (3-10 μg) was mixed 1:1 with 2X Novex sample buffer (Thermo, LC6876), boiled at 94°C for 3 minutes and placed on ice for 3-5 minutes. Samples were loaded onto a 15% TBE-Urea gel (MINI-Protean, Bio-rad, 4566053) and run at 150 V for 2-2.5 hours. A Hybond N+ membrane (GE lifesciences, 45000854) and 6 sheets of 3 mm Whatman cellulose paper (Sigma Aldrich, WHA3030861) were pre-soaked for 5 minutes in room temperature 0.5X TBE, then assembled into a sandwich of: 3 layers Whatman paper, Hybond membrane, TBE-Urea gel, and 3 more layers of Whatman paper. Blotting was performed using a Trans-blot Turbo (Bio-Rad) at 200 mA for 30 minutes. The membrane was then pre-hybridized in 10 mL ExpressHyb (Clontech, NC9747391) at 44°C in a rotating oven for 1 hour, and probed overnight at 44°C, with rotation, using probes conjugated to irDyes (LICOR; 680CW 929-50010, 800CW 929-50000), made following the protocol detailed at ( https://bio-protocol.org/e3219 ) ( Fields et al., 2019 20. Fields, C. ∙ Sheng, P. ∙ Miller, B. ... Northern Blot with IR Fluorescent Probes: Strategies for Probe Preparation Biol. Protoc. 2019; 9 :e3219 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). The membrane was washed once with 2X SSC/0.1% SDS, and once with 1X SSC/0.1% SDS each for 10 minutes at RT, then visualized on the Odyssey Fc (LICOR). 4.5S RNA was used as a loading control (stability of 4.5S across genetic backgrounds was verified by qPCR, data not shown). For Northern blots performed using S. pyogenes cells using the tracrRNA probe, a nonspecific band (NS) was used as a loading control. Sequences for oligos used to probe crRNA , tracrRNA and 4.5S RNA (oJW2313, oJW1991, oJW2172) are listed in Table S4 .
1.8E8 S. aureus cells were resuspended in 1X PBS supplemented with Lysostaphin (60 μg/ml final concentration) and incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes. Cells were processed from overnight cultures unless otherwise specified. Whole cell lysate was mixed 1:1 with 2x Laemmli solution (Bio-rad, 1610737) supplemented with B-mercaptoethanol (55 mM stock, ThermoFisher, 21985023) at a final concentration of 1.3 mM, and boiled at 98°C for 10 minutes. Samples were loaded onto a 4%–20% Tris-glycine gel (MINI-Protean TGX Pre-cast, Bio-rad, 4561095) and run at 200 V for 15 min-1 hour. A PVDF membrane (Bio-rad) was hydrated with methanol for 15-30 s and pre-wet alongside a stack of blotting paper for 3-5 minutes in 1X Transfer buffer. A blotting sandwich was assembled consisting of six layers (one stack) of filter paper, the PVDF membrane, Tris-glycine gel, and another stack of filter paper. Samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane with the Trans-blot turbo (Bio-Rad, 1704150), with high molecular weight transfer settings (1.6 A for 10 minutes), and the membrane was stained with Ponceau for 5 minutes to perform total protein normalization. In western blot figures, the prominent Ponceau-stained band is shown as a loading control (total protein, TPN). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 hour, then probed with a 1:1000 dilution of Cas9 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, 7A9-3A3) for 2 hours at RT, or at 4°C overnight. The membrane was washed with 1X TBST buffer 3x for 10 minutes at RT, then probed with 1:15,000 dilution of infrared (LICOR, 925-32210) or 1:10,000 dilution of HRP (Pierce, PA174421) secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was washed as before, then visualized on the Odyssey Fc (LICOR). To analyze S. pyogenes Cas9 levels, ∼1.8E8 cells were resuspended in 1X PBS supplemented with PlyC (1 μg/ml final concentration) and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. After lysis, the Western protocol was followed as detailed above.
To prepare RNA libraries for next-generation sequencing, we first depleted ribosomal RNA from the total purified RNA using reverse capture of biotinylated probes annealing to rRNA with streptavidin beads, following the protocol detailed at ( https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/2/e00010-20 ) ( Culviner et al., 2020 12. Culviner, P.H. ∙ Guegler, C.K. ∙ Laub, M.T. A Simple, Cost-Effective, and Robust Method for rRNA Depletion in RNA-Sequencing Studies MBio. 2020; 11 Published online April 21, 2020 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). rRNA depleted samples were prepared for sequencing using the Cleantag Small RNA library prep kit (Trilink, L-3206-24) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with 10 ng RNA input and 18 PCR cycles. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq with a v3 2x75 cycle kit at the Johns Hopkins Genome Resources Core Facility (GRCF).
Purified total RNA (1-4 μg) was treated with TURBO DNA-free (ThermoFisher, AM1907) and reverse transcribed with Superscript IV (ThermoFisher, 18090050) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was diluted to 0.5-1 ng/μL and 4-8 ng was used as input in an 8 μL volume. 1 μL of 10 μM forward/reverse primers were used, and 10 μL of 2X PowerUp SYBR mastermix (ThermoFisher, A25742). qPCR was performed with cycling conditions: 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 2 minutes, 39 cycles of [60°C 1 minute], followed by a melt curve: 65°C to 95°C, incrementing 0.5°C every 5 s. rho was used as a loading control and was amplified using primers oJW2003/2004. cas9 was amplified with primers oW262/oJW1986. cas1 was amplified using primers oJW150/oL432. csn2 was amplified using primers oJW2139/2140. The region spanning csn2 and crRNA ( csn2_cr ) was amplified using oJW2141/2142. The pre-crRNA was amplified using oJW2142/2143. All forms of tracrRNA ( tracr-L , tracr-S , and tracr-P ) were amplified using oJW2012/2013. Streptococcus agalactiae cas9 was amplified using primers oJW2849/2850. In the native Streptococcus pyogenes system, gyrase A ( gyrA) was used as a loading control and was amplified with primers oJW2595/2596. qPCR primer sequences are provided in Table S4 .
10 mL overnight cultures of cells harboring derivatives of pTP16, which encodes cas9 and tracrRN A variants with increasing tracr-L match lengths to the GFP reporter plasmids pJW711 and pCN57 were diluted to OD = 0.1 and outgrown in BHI supplemented with chloramphenicol for 1-2 hours until the OD was between 0.8-1. The cultures were centrifuged at 4200 RPM for 10 minutes and washed twice with 1 mL of ice-cold deionized water in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 6000 RPM 1 minute spins between washes. Cells were resuspended in 150 μL 10% glycerol and stored at −80°C if not used immediately. 50 ng of pJW711, pCN57, or an empty vector pE194 was electroporated into 50 μl of competent cells and outgrown in 300 μl BHI at 37°C with shaking for 3 hours. 100 μL of each outgrowth was plated onto BHI agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol and erythromycin and total transformants were counted the following day.
IVT templates were generated using pTP16 and pRW22-26, the forward primer oJW2267 and reverse primers oJW2268-2274, which begin with the T7 promoter sequence (5′- GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′). To generate tracr-L , pTP16 was amplified with oJW2267 and oJW2268. To generate the GFP-targeting tracr-L with an 11-bp match, pRW22 was amplified with oJW2267 and oJW2269. To generate the GFP-targeting tracr-L with a 13-bp match, pRW23 was amplified with oJW2267 and oJW2270. To generate the GFP-targeting tracr-L with a 15-bp match, pRW24 was amplified with oJW2267 and oJW2271. To generate the GFP-targeting tracr-L with a 17-bp match, pRW25 was amplified with oJW2267 and oJW2272. To generate the GFP-targeting tracr-L with a 19-bp match, pRW26 was amplified with oJW2267 and oJW2273. To generate the sgRNA version of the GFP targeting tracr-L with a 20-bp match, pRW27 was amplified with oJW2267 and oJW2274. tracr-L (wild-type and variants) was in-vitro transcribed from 1 μg of these templates using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA synthesis kit (NEB, E2040S). Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 4 hours and run on a 6% TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen, EC6265BOX). Bands of the appropriate size were excised, added to a sterile Eppendorf tube in 450 μL gel extraction buffer (1X: 0.3 M NaOAc, 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA), and incubated overnight at 4°C in an end-over-end rotator. The buffer with dissolved gel slice was added to 1 mL ice-cold 100% ethanol and 2 μL of glycogen (20 mg/ml, ThermoFisher, R0561) and incubated at −20°C for at least one hour. Samples were centrifuged at max speed at 4°C for 30 minutes, the supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was washed with 1 mL cold 70% ethanol. After another centrifugation step at max speed for 10 minutes at 4°C, the pellets were either dried in a vacuum centrifuge or let air dry for 10 minutes and eluted in Ambion RNase-free water.
DsDNA target substrates were prepared by mixing 20 μL of 20 μM 55-nt top and bottom strand oligos (P cas : oJW2507/2508, P gfp :oJW2509/2510, P cas NGC :oJW2816/2817) in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), heating to 95°C for 5 minutes, then slowly cooling the mixture to room temperature for 1-2 hours. Annealed oligos were mixed with 4 μL 6X loading dye (NEB, B7024S), loaded onto a lab-made 8% TBE gel (Acrylamide/Bis solution 37.5:1, Bio-rad, 1610148), run at 200V for 1 hour, then stained with SYBR Gold (ThermoFisher, S11494) for 10 minutes still, and 10 minutes shaking. Bands of the appropriate size were excised and added to a sterile Eppendorf tube in 450 μL gel extraction buffer (1X: 0.3 M NaOAc, 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA), and incubated overnight at room temperature in a shaker. Gel extraction buffer was added to 1 mL ice-cold 100% ethanol and 2 μL of glycogen (20 mg/mL, ThermoFisher) and incubated at −20C for at least one hour. Samples were centrifuged at max speed at 4°C for 30 minutes, and the pellet was washed with 1 mL cold 70% ethanol. Following another centrifugation step at max speed for 10 minutes at 4°C, pellets were either dried in a vacuum centrifuge or let air dry for 10 minutes, then eluted in RNase-free water (Ambion). Purified dsDNAs were diluted to 200 nM with binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 10% glycerol), then diluted again 1:10 in binding buffer to make a 20 nM stock.
After dsDNA purification, the substrate was radiolabeled with P32 (1 μL 20 nM oligo duplex, 5 μL T4 PNK buffer, 10 mM radioactive ATP, 2 μL T4 PNK in a 50 μL reaction). This reaction was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour and cleaned up with ProbeQuant G50 spin columns (GE Healthcare, GE28-9034-08) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Wild-type tracr-L was prepared by performing in vitro transcription as described in in vitro transcription methods above. Tracr-L was diluted to 8 μM in RNA hybridization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2), then heated at 95°C for 30 s and slow cooled to room temperature (1-2 hours). Cas9 (10 mg/mL, generously gifted by the Seydoux lab) was diluted to 8 μM in storage buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl). Cas9: tracr-L RNPs were pre-formed by mixing 10 μL 8 μM Cas9 with 10 μL 8 μM tracr-L and incubating at RT for 10 minutes. RNPs were diluted to 500 pM - 1 μM in a 1:1 mix of RNA hybridization buffer and Cas9 storage buffer, then brought to volume with binding buffer. For the Cas9-only control, RNA hybridization buffer was substituted for tracr-L . 2 μl of radiolabeled substrate (final concentration 50 pM) was added to each reaction and mixed gently by pipetting. The binding reaction was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, then quenched with 2 μL 6X purple loading dye (NEB) at RT. 15 μL of each reaction was immediately loaded onto an 8% TBE gel (Acrylamide/Bis solution 37.5:1, Bio-rad) supplemented with 2 mM MgCl2, and run at 4°C at 15W in 1X TBE buffer + 5 mM MgCl2 for 75-90 minutes. The gel was then removed from its casing, wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to a phosphor screen overnight. The phosphor screen was scanned and imaged using the Typhoon FLA9500 (GE Healthcare).
20 μL nuclease-free water, 3 μL NEBuffer 3.1, 3 μL of in vitro transcribed 300 nM sgRNA or tracr-L (produced as described in in vitro transcription protocol above) and 1 μL of 1 μM Cas9 nuclease (NEB, M0386S) were mixed and incubated for 10 minutes at 25°C to allow for RNP formation. Next, 3 μL of a 30 nM dsDNA substrate (a 1kb pCN57 amplicon, amplified from pCN57 with oJW134 and oJW1869) was added, mixed thoroughly, pulsed in a microcentrifuge, and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. Final concentrations of the reaction components were 30 nM sgRNA or tracr-L , 33.3 nM purified Cas9 and 3 nM dsDNA. 1 μL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL, QIAGEN) was added and samples were incubated at RT for 10 minutes. 6X loading dye was added, and the reactions were run on a 1.5% agarose gel.
To investigate the fitness costs of Δ tr acr -L , cells harboring a naive wild-type or Δ tr acr -L CRISPR system were co-cultured in a long-term competition assay. Wild-type and Δ tr acr -L cells were inoculated in BHI in triplicate and grown overnight at 37°C, diluted to log phase OD = 0.1, and replicate pairs were mixed 1:1. 50 μL of a 1:100 dilution of this mixture was immediately plated, and 900 μL was frozen at −80°C in 10% DMSO. The remainder of the mixture was grown to stationary phase in the evening, then diluted back 1:1000 and grown overnight. This continued for a total of 5 days, with frozen stocks taken of the cultures each morning before dilution. To determine the ratio of wild-type:Δ tr acr -L cells over time, 5 μL of frozen cultures were diluted 1:5000 and plated, and colonies were picked for colony lysis and PCR of the tracrRNA locus (oJW2012/oJW1447). Amplicon length (314 bp for wild-type and 262 bp for Δ tr acr -L ) allowed us to estimate the relative abundance of each strain in the mixed culture over time.
Sequencing reads were processed with custom Python scripts and aligned to the NCTC8325 genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner ( Li and Durbin, 2009 43. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32751) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tn-seq output was visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer3 ( Robinson et al., 2011 65. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Winckler, W. ... Integrative genomics viewer Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :24-26 Crossref Scopus (9419) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Measurements for absorbance (at 600 nm) and fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 485 nm; emission wavelength = 535 nm) were taken using a TECAN Infinite F Nano+. For each experimental strain, promoter activity was measured as (Fe)/(Ae) - (Fc)/(Ac) where F = fluorescence, A = absorbance, e = experimental strain and c = non-fluorescent control strain.
Bound and unbound intensities for EMSA blots were quantified using ImageJ, and fraction bound was plotted against RNP concentration using GraphPad for Mac version Prism 7.4, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, https://www.graphpad.com:443/ . A nonlinear regression curve fit was applied to extract the K d using Prism 7.4, and was performed separately for two independent analyses.
Sequencing reads were aligned to the NCTC8325 genome and CRISPR plasmid pCR using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Binary alignment files (BAM) were converted to bedgraph format and scaled to reads per million (RPM) using bedtools genomecov. Bedgraph pile-ups were visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer.
Sequencing reads were processed with custom Python scripts and aligned to the NCTC8325 genome, CRISPR plasmid pCR (shorthand for pGG32, pRH163, or pGG32_Δ tr-L depending on the sample), or bacteriophage φNM4γ4 reference sequences using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Binary alignment files (BAM) were converted to bed format. Spacers with no mismatches were aggregated by genomic position, then multiplied by a correction factor accounting for the last base of the spacer (A: 1.812265748, C: 0.267975994, T: 5.640697298, G: 2.467159171), in order to normalize values to the expected frequencies. This normalization was applied as the enrichment PCR process intentionally avoids priming against the single repeat in non-adapted plasmids by using a mix of primers complementary to the last base of a newly acquired spacer (3′ ending in T, A, or G) and omitting the reverse primer ending in C. Additionally, because of the increased bond strength of G-C basepairs, spacers ending in C are overrepresented compared to those ending in A or T. To visualize spacer distributions from a given source, reads per million (RPM) were calculated as follows: the number of normalized reads at a given location were divided by the total number of reads aligned to that source for that experiment and multiplied by one million (RPM chr for spacers matching the RN4220 chromosome; RPM φNM2 for spacers matching φNM4γ4). RPM were aggregated in 10 kb bins for the RN4220 chromosome and 1 kb bins for φNM4γ4.
Bacterial strains harboring type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems with previously annotated short-form tracrRNAs ( Faure et al., 2019 18. Faure, G. ∙ Shmakov, S.A. ∙ Makarova, K.S. ... Comparative genomics and evolution of trans-activating RNAs in Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems RNA Biol. 2019; 16 :435-448 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) were investigated for evidence of tracr-L repression. Accession numbers for species investigated are listed in Table S2 along with all metadata compiled in our analyses. The genomic locus between the annotated 3′ end of tracrRNA and the translational start site of Cas9 was interrogated using the DSK k-mer counting software ( Rizk et al., 2013 64. Rizk, G. ∙ Lavenier, D. ∙ Chikhi, R. DSK: k-mer counting with very low memory usage Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :652-653 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ) with k-mer length set to 11 bp and a minimal match frequency of 2. We classified strains as “ tracr-L+ ” if one k-mer instance was on the same strand as tracr-S followed immediately by a 5′-GTTTTA-3′ sequence allowing for 1 mismatch (representing the targeting site within tracr-L ) and the other instance was upstream of site 1, immediately followed by a 5′-NGG-3′ sequence allowing for 1 mismatch (representing the targeted site within P cas ). We manually inspected the 16 tracr-L loci with intergenic lengths above 167 bp for candidate tracr-L targeting sites with a single seed mismatch but perfect lower stems and PAMs, and found one additional tracr-L sequence with a 10 bp match.
We aligned tracrRNA sequences using MAFFT ( Katoh et al., 2002 40. Katoh, K. ∙ Misawa, K. ∙ Kuma, K. ... MAFFT: a novel method for rapid multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 :3059-3066 Crossref Scopus (11423) PubMed Google Scholar ) (default parameters). Cas9 amino acid sequences for these strains were aligned using MUSCLE ( Edgar, 2004 16. Edgar, R.C. MUSCLE: a multiple sequence alignment method with reduced time and space complexity BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5 :113 Crossref Scopus (6744) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using FastTree ( Price et al., 2010 60. Price, M.N. ∙ Dehal, P.S. ∙ Arkin, A.P. FastTree 2--approximately maximum-likelihood trees for large alignments PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e9490 Crossref Scopus (9016) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the WAG evolutionary model. All multiple sequence alignments and tree generation were performed in Geneious Prime 2020.1.1.
