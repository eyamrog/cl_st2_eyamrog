Title: XIST loss impairs mammary stem cell differentiation and increases tumorigenicity through Mediator hyperactivation


Abstract: Summary

X inactivation (XCI) is triggered by upregulation of XIST , which coats the chromosome in cis , promoting formation of a heterochromatic domain (Xi). XIST role beyond initiation of XCI is only beginning to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that XIST loss impairs differentiation of human mammary stem cells (MaSCs) and promotes emergence of highly tumorigenic and metastatic carcinomas. On the Xi, XIST deficiency triggers epigenetic changes and reactivation of genes overlapping Polycomb domains, including Mediator subunit MED14 . MED14 overdosage results in increased Mediator levels and hyperactivation of the MaSC enhancer landscape and transcriptional program, making differentiation less favorable. We further demonstrate that loss of XIST and Xi transcriptional instability is common among human breast tumors of poor prognosis. We conclude that XIST is a gatekeeper of human mammary epithelium homeostasis, thus unveiling a paradigm in the control of somatic cell identity with potential consequences for our understanding of gender-specific malignancies.

Section: Introduction

X inactivation (XCI) ensures dosage compensation between sexes via transcriptional silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in female cells ( Lyon, 1961 80. Lyon, M.F. Gene action in the X-chromosome of the mouse (Mus musculus L.) Nature. 1961; 190 :372-373 Crossref Scopus (2631) PubMed Google Scholar ). To elicit XCI, the X-inactive specific transcript ( Xist ) is upregulated in early development from one of the two X chromosomes and coats it in cis , triggering a cascade of epigenetic events that impose a silent and compacted chromatin state ( Loda and Heard, 2019 76. Loda, A. ∙ Heard, E. Xist RNA in action: past, present, and future PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1008333 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the maintenance phase, Xist remains highly expressed and tethered to the inactive X (Xi). The essentiality of Xist during initiation and establishment of XCI is well established ( Penny et al., 1996 92. Penny, G.D. ∙ Kay, G.F. ∙ Sheardown, S.A. ...

Xist-deficient mice are defective in dosage compensation but not spermatogenesis Genes Dev. 1997; 11 :156-166 Crossref Scopus (585) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, its role in the maintenance phase is still a matter of debate. Xist was long thought to be dispensable for gene silencing in somatic cells, as multiple studies reported a largely silent, heterochromatic Xi upon its deletion ( Brown and Willard, 1994 15.

However, these studies relied on assessment of a limited number of genes. The use of the more sensitive assays has provided examples of transcriptional reactivation events on the Xi upon deletion of XIST in post-XCI cells ( Zhang et al., 2007 134.

Whether changes in dosage of any of these genes can interfere with cellular function is key to understanding the impact of XIST dysregulation in human disease ( Richardson et al., 2006 101.

Although some studies documented widespread tolerance to Xist loss ( Adrianse et al., 2018 2. Adrianse, R.L. ∙ Smith, K. ∙ Gatbonton-Schwager, T. ...

USA. 2020; 117 :4262-4272 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), others reported remarkable phenotypical consequences. For instance, human stem cells with no XIST expression and an epigenetically eroded Xi fail to differentiate in teratoma assays ( Anguera et al., 2012 5. Anguera, M.C. ∙ Sadreyev, R. ∙ Zhang, Z. ... Molecular signatures of human induced pluripotent stem cells highlight sex differences and cancer genes Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11 :75-90 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Knockout mice for Xist or Ciz1 —a protein of the nuclear matrix that anchors Xist to the Xi—present with impaired maturation of all blood lineages and female-specific hematological tumors ( Yildirim et al., 2013 131. Yildirim, E. ∙ Kirby, J.E. ∙ Brown, D.E. ...

The nuclear matrix protein CIZ1 facilitates localization of Xist RNA to the inactive X-chromosome territory Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :876-888 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, aberrant expression and/or localization of XIST are common features of breast tumors ( Kawakami et al., 2004 64. Kawakami, T. ∙ Zhang, C. ∙ Taniguchi, T. ... Characterization of loss-of-inactive X in Klinefelter syndrome and female-derived cancer cells Oncogene. 2004; 23 :6163-6169 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chaligné et al., 2015 22. Chaligné, R. ∙ Popova, T. ∙ Mendoza-Parra, M.-A. ... The inactive X chromosome is epigenetically unstable and transcriptionally labile in breast cancer Genome Res. 2015; 25 :488-503 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Altogether, these data support the notion that at least in some backgrounds, overdosage of X-linked genes interferes with cell homeostasis and even elicits carcinogenesis.
Here, we provide evidence that disrupting XIST in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) results in defective differentiation of mammary stem cells (MaSCs) and transcriptional reactivation on the Xi of a subset of Polycomb domain-overlapping genes. Mechanistically, we show that reactivation and increased dosage of MED14 contributes to the MaSC differentiation defect by stabilizing the Mediator complex and the stem cell-associated enhancer landscape. Expansion of the MaSC compartment elicited by loss of XIST has a profound impact on tumorigenicity, with XIST -depleted cells giving rise to penetrant, fast-growing, metastatic tumors upon transformation. Finally, exploration of public datasets of human breast cancer reveals that loss of XIST and transcriptional reactivation of the Xi are common features of tumors of poor prognosis enriched in cancer stem cell (CSC) features.

Section: Results

To investigate XIST role in cellular homeostasis, we selected immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC-hTERT-SV40T/t or HMLE) as our in vitro model, since they present a rudimentary hierarchy consisting of mammary stem cells (MaSCs; CD44 + /CD24 − ) and mature luminal cells (ML; CD44 − /CD24 + ) ( Elenbaas et al., 2001 40. Elenbaas, B. ∙ Spirio, L. ∙ Koerner, F. ... Human breast cancer cells generated by oncogenic transformation of primary mammary epithelial cells Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :50-65 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mani et al., 2008 82. Mani, S.A. ∙ Guo, W. ∙ Liao, M.-J. ... The epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates cells with properties of stem cells Cell. 2008; 133 :704-715 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6795) PubMed Google Scholar ). Assessment of CD49f and epithelial specific antigen (ESA) expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) revealed that MaSC can be further subdivided into MaSC1 (ESA − /CD49f + ) and MaSC2 (ESA − /CD49f − ) ( Figure S1 A). To determine the hierarchical relationships between HMLE subpopulations, we performed clonogenic assays where FACS-sorted individual cells were grown separately and monitored for their ESA/CD49f phenotype. MaSC1 cells gave rise to both MaSC2 and ML cells, whereas MaSC2 were only able to self-propagate, concordantly with our previous work defining MaSC2 as an early myoepithelial-committed progenitor ( Morel et al., 2017 86. Morel, A.P. ∙ Ginestier, C. ∙ Pommier, R.M. ... A stemness-related ZEB1-MSRB3 axis governs cellular pliancy and breast cancer genome stability Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :568-578 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). ML cells were restricted to the luminal lineage ( Figure 1 A).
We generated two XIST knockout (KO) HMLE clones via CRISPR-mediated insertion of a cassette into XIST exon 1 that prompts transcription termination ( Wassef et al., 2017 127. Wassef, M. ∙ Luscan, A. ∙ Battistella, A. ... Versatile and precise gene-targeting strategies for functional studies in mammalian cell lines Methods. 2017; 121–122 :45-54 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 B). The KO cassette disrupts the A repeat ( Table S1 )—the most 5′ functional domain of XIST —rendering the short remaining transcript ineffective. KO cells showed virtually complete abrogation of XIST expression, measured by RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, and RNA-FISH ( Figures S1 B–S1D). Interestingly, we detected significantly higher numbers of MaSC2 and a dramatically reduced ability of MaSC1 to give rise to ML cells in both clones ( Figures 1 B and 1C). XIST loss had no impact on MaSC2 or ML cells ( Figure 1 C), suggesting that expansion of MaSC2 was not due to ML dedifferentiation but to impairment of MaSC1 maturation.
To disrupt XIST expression via an alternative approach, we inhibited its transcription with the CRISPRi dCas9-KRAB fusion protein ( Gilbert et al., 2014 47. Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Adamson, B. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-mediated control of gene repression and activation Cell. 2014; 159 :647-661 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1573) PubMed Google Scholar ) in HMLE and HMEC-hTERT (HME) cells (HMLE/HME-KRAB) ( Figures S1 E and S1F). HME were established from primary cells of a donor different to that of HMLE and retain a simplified hierarchy, whereby MaSC1 mature exclusively into ML ( Figure 1 D; Morel et al., 2017 86. Morel, A.P. ∙ Ginestier, C. ∙ Pommier, R.M. ... A stemness-related ZEB1-MSRB3 axis governs cellular pliancy and breast cancer genome stability Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :568-578 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently with the CRISPR KO clones, HMLE and HME transduced with XIST -targeting sgRNAs (sgXIST) displayed impaired MaSC1-to-ML maturation when subjected to clonogenic differentiation assays ( Figures 1 E, S1 G, and S1H).
To evaluate the impact of XIST loss on MaSC1 repopulating activity, we grew mammospheres in suspension cultures from control (sgCTRL) and sgXIST HME-KRAB cells and observed that XIST depletion enhanced by 25-fold their sphere-forming efficiency (SFE) ( Figure 1 F). Establishment of 3D cultures showed that XIST -silenced HME-KRAB cells produced significantly larger and more complex organoids than sgCTRL cells ( Figures 1 G and 1H). Mammary organoids can form acini/low-branched structures or highly-branched lobular-like structures. The first type arises from luminal progenitors; the second type from MaSC ( Lim et al., 2009 75. Lim, E. ∙ Vaillant, F. ∙ Wu, D. ... Aberrant luminal progenitors as the candidate target population for basal tumor development in BRCA1 mutation carriers Nat. Med. 2009; 15 :907-913 Crossref Scopus (1034) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that XIST depletion enhances MaSC potential. We also xenotransplanted sgCTRL and sgXIST HME-KRAB cells into cleared, humanized mouse mammary fat pads and detected formation of human mammary epithelial ducts with the expected tissue organization (CK8 + luminal layer and SMA + myoepithelial cell layer) in both conditions ( Figures 1 I and S1 I). Nonetheless, sgXIST cells had higher in vivo outgrowth-forming capacity, and their estimated MaSC frequency was significantly higher ( Figure 1 J), confirming that XIST loss increases MaSC frequency and repopulating activity.
Lastly, to investigate the role of XIST in a system as close as possible to the normal breast, primary human mammary epithelial cells (pHMECs) were extracted from reduction mammoplasties and immediately transduced with the lentiviral constructs for dCas9-KRAB and sgCTRL or sgXIST ( Figure 1 K). XIST expression was successfully silenced in pHMECs, as shown by qRT-PCR ( Figure S1 J). sgXIST pHMECs gave rise to bigger and more complex organoids when cultured in 3D and showed higher repopulation capacity when transplanted into mouse mammary fat pads ( Figures 1 L and 1M), two observations that are indicative of higher abundance of MaSC cells.
Altogether, our results sustain that loss of XIST leads to impaired MaSC1 differentiation and increased repopulating capacity, suggesting that XIST acts as a gatekeeper of mammary epithelial cell homeostasis.
We hypothesized that defective differentiation triggered by XIST loss arises from transcriptional reactivation of X-linked genes. We thus assessed the transcriptional and epigenetic status of the Xi in WT and KO#1 HMLE using a combination of RNA-seq and Cut&Run-seq for a panel of histone modifications. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis of RNA-seq data showed segregation by genotype and clustering of replicates ( Figure S2 A). As expected from the synergism of the Xi-associated heterochromatin marks ( Csankovszki et al., 2001 31. Csankovszki, G. ∙ Nagy, A. ∙ Jaenisch, R. Synergism of Xist RNA, DNA methylation, and histone hypoacetylation in maintaining X chromosome inactivation J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153 :773-784 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ), differential expression analysis showed no evidence of chromosome-wide transcriptional reactivation or marked imbalance in the X-to-autosome ratios in KO cells ( Figures 2 A, S2 B). In agreement with prior reports ( Plath et al., 2003 96. Plath, K. ∙ Fang, J. ∙ Mlynarczyk-Evans, S.K. ...

Cell. 2004; 7 :663-676 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (707) PubMed Google Scholar ), continuous coating by XIST was required for recruitment of Polycomb to the Xi and deposition of H2AK119Ub and H3K27me3 ( Figure 2 B). Enrichment analysis for these marks on autosomal genes confirmed this to be an Xi-specific effect ( Figure S2 C). This was accompanied by an increase in H3K27Ac, but not in H3K4me3, at promoters of X-linked genes in both KO MaSC and ML cells ( Figure 2 B). In parallel, assessment of enhancer activity based on H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 unveiled a significant increase in both marks at X-linked enhancers ( Figure 2 C) and, intriguingly, at autosomal enhancers ( Figure S2 D). The observed changes in H3K27Ac accumulation at promoters and enhancers of X-linked genes are suggestive of partial Xi reactivation in the absence of XIST .
Allelic analyses have shown that genes on the Xi are not homogeneously silenced. In human, 15% constitutively escape inactivation, and an additional 15% show variable escape between cells, tissues, and individuals ( Carrel and Willard, 2005 18. Carrel, L. ∙ Willard, H.F.

USA. 2018; 115 :13015-13020 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). To delimit the transcriptional reactivation events on the Xi, we sequenced the genome of HMLE and identified informative heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on X-linked genes: 843 SNPs were found on 363 mRNAs, whereas 2,340 were mapped to 461 promoters (TSS ± 3 kb). Allele-specific analysis of RNA-seq and Cut&Run-seq data for H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac allowed us to define the inactivation status of 176 X-linked genes ( Table S2 ). In WT cells, 13 genes showed biallelic expression (constitutive escapees), and 163 were monoallelically expressed (subject), our classification showing a high degree of overlap with previous reports ( Carrel and Willard, 2005 18.

Tukiainen, T. ∙ Villani, A.-C. ∙ Yen, A. ... Landscape of X chromosome inactivation across human tissues Nature. 2017; 550 :244-248 Crossref Scopus (481) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). Deletion of XIST left most X-linked genes unaffected, apart from 13 reactivated genes acquiring biallelic expression and/or accumulation of activating histone modifications in KO cells ( Figures 2 D and S2 E). Of the 13 reactivated genes, 11 were expressed in HMLE cells and, among these, 9 showed statistically significant differences in at least one cell compartment ( Figure 2 D), suggesting that the differences in allelic ratios (ARs) were due to transcriptional reactivation of the Xi allele rather than to silencing of the allele on the active X. In contrast, only 1 of 13 constitutive escapees and 9 of 143 subject genes were differentially expressed ( Figure 2 D). Allele-specific analysis of genes on chr2 showed no differences in terms of expression or enrichment of histone modifications between WT and KO cells ( Table S3 ), suggesting that the impact of XIST loss in allelic expression is restricted to the X. Most reactivated genes were previously annotated as escapees or variable escapees ( Figure 2 D), accumulated in the short arm of the X, and clustered in proximity to constitutive escapees ( Figure 2 E), thus indicating they are in a permissive environment for transcriptional activation.
In silico predictions of transcriptional reactivation were validated by RNA-FISH and pyrosequencing ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Importantly, increased expression of the Xi allele translated into mRNA and protein upregulation, as measured by RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting ( Figures 2 D, 2F, and 2G). A similar degree of reactivation was observed upon XIST silencing in HMLE and HME ( Figures 2 H, 2I, and S2 H–S2J).
To summarize, loss of XIST in mammary epithelial cells leads to partial Xi reactivation and changes in X-linked dosage.
During initiation of XCI, Xist recruits chromatin-modifying complexes to the future Xi that catalyze modification of histone tails, promoter CpG methylation, and substitution of core histones to eventually establish an heterochromatic domain ( Loda and Heard, 2019 76. Loda, A. ∙ Heard, E. Xist RNA in action: past, present, and future PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1008333 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ).

This is thought to trigger a Polycomb cascade, whereby deposition of H2AK119Ub by PRC1 stabilizes recruitment of other ncPRC1 complexes, PRC2 and, eventually, canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) ( Chu et al., 2015 28.

We investigated the epigenomic context and dependencies of reactivated genes. Enrichment analysis of H3K27me3 and H2AK119Ub revealed striking differences between genes grouped by their XCI status in HMLE ( Figure 3 A). As expected, constitutive escapees showed low enrichment for H3K27me3 and H2AK119Ub when compared with genes subjected to XCI ( Goto and Kimura, 2009 50. Goto, Y. ∙ Kimura, H.

Cotton, A.M. ∙ Ge, B. ∙ Light, N. ... Analysis of expressed SNPs identifies variable extents of expression from the human inactive X chromosome Genome Biol. 2013; 14 :R122 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, reactivated genes displayed the highest levels of both Polycomb marks ( Figures 3 A and S2 E). Exploration of public datasets of DNA methylation ( Sharp et al., 2011 106. Sharp, A.J. ∙ Stathaki, E. ∙ Migliavacca, E. ... DNA methylation profiles of human active and inactive X chromosomes Genome Res. 2011; 21 :1592-1600 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed that reactivated genes display comparable or even lower levels of promoter DNA methylation than constitutive escapees ( Figure 3 B).
To test the dependency of reactivated genes on PRC2-mediated deposition of H3K27me3, we inhibited PRC2 enzymatic activity in WT HMLE with the small-molecule inhibitor UNC1999, using its inactive analog UNC2400 as control ( Konze et al., 2013 68. Konze, K.D. ∙ Ma, A. ∙ Li, F. ... An orally bioavailable chemical probe of the lysine methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1 ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 :1324-1334 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment with UNC1999 (1 μM) led to the depletion of H3K27me3 and upregulation HOX genes ( Figures 3 C and 3D). However, analysis of the allelic expression of two reactivated genes, MED14 and USP9X , showed no differences between the control and UNC1999-treated conditions ( Figure 3 E).
To determine the role of PRC1 in repressing expression of reactivated genes, we CRISPR knocked-out RING1A —a core subunit of all PRC1 complexes—in HMLE ( Figure 3 F). We next stably transduced RING1A -KO cells with a dCas9-KRAB and guide RNAs against RING1B to disrupt all PRC1 complexes or against PCGF3/5 (alone and in combination) to specifically target the ncPRC1 involved in initiation of XCI. Derivation of multiple clones per condition and analysis by Western blot and qRT-PCR showed efficient depletion of each targeted component of PRC1 ( Figures 3 Fand 3G). Only disruption of both RING1A and RING1B virtually abrogated H2AK119Ub deposition and resulted in transcriptional reactivation of USP9X and MED14 ( Figures 3 F and 3H). Silencing PCGF3 alone or in combination with PCGF5 also led to, albeit at a lower extent, reactivation of USP9X and MED14 , suggesting that ncPRC1 could also play a role in the maintenance phase of XCI ( Figure 3 H). Allelic expression of ARSD , a gene that remains silent in KO HMLE ( Figure 2 D), was stable in all tested conditions ( Figure 3 H).
To summarize, genes that become reactivated upon loss of XIST overlap with Polycomb domains characterized by low promoter DNA methylation, high H3K27me3, and high H2AK119Ub. However, despite being enriched in both marks, their transcriptional silencing is more reliant on PRC1.
We next assessed whether any of the reactivated genes contributed to the differentiation phenotype by stably transducing sgCTRL and sgXIST HMLE/HME-KRAB cells with sgRNAs directed against USP9X , MED14 , TMEM164 , PLS3 , or RBBP7 . As measured by qRT-PCR, we obtained partial silencing of the target genes leading to, at least, expression levels in sgXIST cells comparable with those of sgCTRL ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Silencing of neither candidate gene affected transcription of the others ( Figure S3 C). Clonogenic differentiation assays showed that depletion of MED14 or RBBP7 restored MaSC1-to-ML differentiation in sgXIST HMLE-KRAB cells ( Figure 4 A). In HME-KRAB, only MED14 silencing restored MaSC1 differentiation ( Figure 4 A). Silencing of neither candidate gene affected the differentiation status of MaSC2 or ML cells ( Figures S3 D and S3E).
To further validate MED14 contribution to the defective differentiation resulting from loss of XIST , we established mammospheres and organoid cultures of HME-KRAB cells. MED14 silencing in sgXIST cells drastically decreased their SFE and the size and complexity of organoids ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Transplantation of MED14 -silenced sgXIST cells into mouse mammary fat pads produced epithelial outgrowths with the expected ductal organization but at a significantly lower rate, comparable with that of control cells ( Figure 4 D).
To determine whether individual upregulation of the candidate genes is sufficient to interfere with MaSC1 differentiation, we generated HMLE with stable integration of a doxycycline-inducible dCas9-VPR (HMLE-VPR). Transduction of cells with sgRNAs against each of the candidates, followed by treatment with doxycycline, efficiently upregulated their mRNA by ∼2–5-fold ( Figure S3 F). Clonogenic differentiation assays of MaSC1 cells revealed the two conditions with the most significant impact on ML differentiation to be those with upregulation of MED14 and RBBP7 ( Figure 4 E).
In summary, reactivation and upregulation of MED14 and, in a context-dependent manner, RBBP7 participate in the dysregulation of cell homeostasis triggered by XIST loss.
MED14 is a subunit of Mediator, which coordinates multiple aspects of transcription to ensure the precise intensity, pattern, and timing of gene expression and is therefore a major determinant of cell fate ( Soutourina, 2018 111. Soutourina, J. Transcription regulation by the Mediator complex Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :262-274 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within the complex, MED14 is a critical functional and structural backbone ( Cevher et al., 2014 21. Cevher, M.A. ∙ Shi, Y. ∙ Li, D. ...

Jaeger, M.G. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Mackowiak, S.D. ... Selective Mediator dependence of cell-type-specifying transcription Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :719-727 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus hypothesized that MED14 upregulation could stabilize the complex and render it more active, resulting in global effects on transcription and cell identity. Higher protein levels of Mediator subunits spanning different modules were detected in KO HMLE ( Figure 5 A), except for MED26 and CDK8. CDK8—Mediator’s kinase module—transiently associates with the core complex ( Soutourina, 2018 111. Soutourina, J. Transcription regulation by the Mediator complex Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :262-274 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is therefore less likely to be impacted by changes in MED14 abundance. Of the 31 subunits, only MED14 and MED17 showed consistently higher mRNA levels in KO cells ( Figures S4 A and S4B), suggesting that accumulation of Mediator involves stabilization of the complex rather than transcriptional regulation, although we cannot rule out some contribution of the latter. Super-resolution confocal imaging of immunofluorescence for MED1—often used as proxy for the complex—revealed that MED1 forms discrete puncta in the nuclei of HMLE cells and that these are significantly larger in both KO MaSC and ML ( Figure 5 B), strengthening the evidence that Mediator is stabilized in the absence of XIST .
We next tested whether stabilization of Mediator was accompanied by changes in its activity. 336 and 833 significantly deregulated genes were identified in KO MaSC and ML cells, respectively. Upregulated genes were more predominant than downregulated ones ( Figure 5 C), consistently with a phenotype of increased Mediator function. To evaluate how these transcriptional changes might contribute to the differentiation phenotype of KO cells, we investigated the TFs and target genes that drive maturation of HMLE ( Figure S4 C). MaSC- and ML-enriched genes belonging to relevant pathways such as “negative regulation of Wnt signaling pathway” or “MAPK signaling pathway” were upregulated in KO MaSC. Most deregulated MaSC genes were also aberrantly high in KO ML cells, whereas ML-specific genes—including key TFs as TP63 , MYC , or JUN —were depleted in the KO ML compartment. These data indicate that XIST-KO MaSC fail at activating the ML transcriptional program and do not properly differentiate into ML cells.
To investigate the impact of increased Mediator levels on enhancer activity, we overlapped the tracks for H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 to identify 53,225 and 43,254 active enhancers in MaSC and ML cells, respectively. In total, 26,753 enhancers were characteristic of MaSC, 12,404 were restricted to ML, and 23,160 were common to both compartments. Enrichment analysis revealed that H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 accumulation was globally higher over MaSC-specific enhancers in KO cells ( Figures 5 D and S5 A). To determine whether differences in histone marks were connected to changes in Mediator occupancy and transcription of associated genes, we focused on enhancers with significant differences in H3K27Ac ( Figure 5 D). ChIP-seq for MED1 showed increased binding over MaSC enhancers with higher levels of H3K27Ac in KO MaSC (n = 400) ( Figure 5 E). In contrast, MED1 occupancy at the smaller pool of H3K27Ac-depleted MaSC enhancers (n = 24) was lower ( Figure 5 E). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that expression of genes linked to hyperactive MaSC enhancers was significantly higher in both KO MaSC and ML ( Figures 5 F–5H), whereas genes under the control of H3K27Ac-depleted enhancers were consistently downregulated ( Figure 5 G). ML-specific enhancers were depleted for H3K4me1 in KO cells but did not display pronounced differences in H3K27Ac ( Figures 5 D and S5 A). Nonetheless, differential analysis identified 86 enhancers with lower levels of H3K27Ac and MED1 in KO MaSC and transcriptional downregulation of associated genes ( Figures 5 D, 5E, 5G, and S5 B). Lastly, common enhancers were overall more enriched for H3K27Ac in KO cells ( Figure 5 D). The impact of differential H3K27Ac accumulation on MED1 binding and transcription regulation for this set of regulatory elements was comparable with that of MaSC-specific enhancers ( Figures 5 E–5G and S5 B). The differential accumulation of histone modifications suggests that the MaSC enhancer landscape becomes hyperactive in the absence of XIST . This results in upregulation of the MaSC transcriptional program, which opposes and limits activation of the ML enhancer network.
If MED14 overdosage impacts cell homeostasis through Mediator stabilization, we reasoned that chemical modulation of Mediator could recapitulate the XIST -null phenotype. We thus evaluated the differentiation potential of HMLE MaSC1 cells in the presence of 8i, an inhibitor of CDK8 ( Lynch et al., 2020 79. Lynch, C.J. ∙ Bernad, R. ∙ Martínez-Val, A. ... Global hyperactivation of enhancers stabilIhuman and mouse naive pluripotency through inhibition of CDK8/19 Mediator kinases Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :1223-1238 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), and OTX015, an inhibitor of BRD4 ( Chapuy et al., 2013 25. Chapuy, B. ∙ McKeown, M.R. ∙ Lin, C.Y. ... Discovery and characterization of super-enhancer-associated dependencies in diffuse large B cell lymphoma Cancer Cell. 2013; 24 :777-790 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ). CDK8 prevents association of Mediator with Pol II and thus inhibition of CDK8 results in enhanced Mediator activity, increased association of Pol II to promoters, and higher transcription of super enhancer target genes ( Pelish et al., 2015 91. Pelish, H.E. ∙ Liau, B.B. ∙ Nitulescu, I.I. ... Mediator kinase inhibition further activates super-enhancer-associated genes in AML Nature. 2015; 526 :273-276 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lynch et al., 2020 79. Lynch, C.J. ∙ Bernad, R. ∙ Martínez-Val, A. ... Global hyperactivation of enhancers stabilIhuman and mouse naive pluripotency through inhibition of CDK8/19 Mediator kinases Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :1223-1238 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, BRD4 inhibitors such as OTX015 trigger eviction of BRD4 and Mediator from enhancers ( Bhagwat et al., 2016 11. Bhagwat, A.S. ∙ Roe, J.-S. ∙ Mok, B.Y.L. ... BET bromodomain inhibition releases the mediator complex from select cis-regulatory elements Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :519-530 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). MaSC1-to-ML differentiation was accelerated by addition of OTX015 and delayed by incubation with 8i ( Figures 5 I and S5 C), suggesting that chemically enhanced Mediator function stabilizes MaSC1 identity and phenocopies XIST loss. The impact of these molecules on MaSC1 maturation was not due to a cytostatic effect since differentiation of MaSC1 grown in 2% FBS was not impaired ( Figure S5 D). KO MaSC1 were resistant to the prodifferentiation effect of OTX015 ( Figures 5 J and S5 E), further supporting that the loss of XIST results in Mediator hyperactivation.
In summary, we reported higher levels of Mediator in KO HMLE that likely stem from transcriptional reactivation of MED14 and stabilization of the complex. This was accompanied by hyperactivation of MaSC enhancers and failure to extinguish the MaSC transcriptional program during maturation towards ML, which we hypothesize is at the basis of the impaired differentiation resulting from loss of XIST .
Cytological disappearance of the Xi is frequent among aggressive breast tumors ( Barr and Moore, 1957 9. Barr, M.L. ∙ Moore, K.L. Chromosomes, sex chromatin, and cancer Proc. Can. Cancer Conf. 1957; 2 :3-16 PubMed Google Scholar ; Borah et al., 1980 14. Borah, V. ∙ Shah, P.N. ∙ Ghosh, S.N. ... Further studies on the prognostic importance of Barr body frequency in human breast cancer: with discussion on its probable mechanism J. Surg. Oncol. 1980; 13 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genetic instability is the most common cause and often involves loss of the Xi and duplication of the active X ( Richardson et al., 2006 101. Richardson, A.L. ∙ Wang, Z.C. ∙ De Nicolo, A. ... X chromosomal abnormalities in basal-like human breast cancer Cancer Cell. 2006; 9 :121-132 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (677) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vincent-Salomon et al., 2007 121.

X inactive-specific transcript RNA coating and genetic instability of the X chromosome in BRCA1 breast tumors Cancer Res. 2007; 67 :5134-5140 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other tumors display major epigenetic erosion of the Xi ( Kawakami et al., 2004 64. Kawakami, T. ∙ Zhang, C. ∙ Taniguchi, T. ... Characterization of loss-of-inactive X in Klinefelter syndrome and female-derived cancer cells Oncogene. 2004; 23 :6163-6169 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chaligné et al., 2015 22. Chaligné, R. ∙ Popova, T. ∙ Mendoza-Parra, M.-A. ... The inactive X chromosome is epigenetically unstable and transcriptionally labile in breast cancer Genome Res. 2015; 25 :488-503 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both scenarios lead to abnormal X dosage, suggesting that it could be positively selected during carcinogenesis.
Having shown that XIST loss triggers changes in X dosage and disrupts MaSC1 differentiation, we hypothesized that it may also influence tumor formation ( Visvader, 2011 122. Visvader, J.E. Cells of origin in cancer Nature. 2011; 469 :314-322 Crossref Scopus (1054) PubMed Google Scholar ). WT and KO HMLE were transformed with HRAS G12V , resulting in aberrant activation of the RAS-ERK pathway (HMLER) ( Figure S6 A). Direct mutations on HRAS are rare in breast cancer, but RAS-ERK is hyperactive in over 50% of tumors ( Von Lintig et al., 2000 123. Von Lintig, F.C. ∙ Dreilinger, A.D. ∙ Varki, N.M. ... Ras activation in human breast cancer Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62 :51-62 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Galiè, 2019 42. Galiè, M. RAS as supporting actor in breast cancer Front. Oncol. 2019; 9 :1199 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, no additional Xi transcriptional reactivation events were detected in HMLER with the exception of ZFX ( Figure S6 B).
Mice recipient of WT HMLER in xenotransplantation assays exhibited superior tumor-free survival rates than those injected with KO cells ( Figure 6 A), suggesting that XIST loss may expand the pool of tumor-initiating CSCs. RAS-ERK activation increased the number of CD44 + /CD24 − CSCs in WT HMLER compared with untransformed cells ( Figure 6 B), this being even more pronounced in KO HMLER. Consistently, mammosphere assays showed that XIST loss further enhances the SFE of HMLER cells ( Figure 6 C). Comparable observations were made in HRAS G12V -overexpressing HME-KRAB (HMER-KRAB), where XIST depletion was also associated with expansion of CSCs ( Figures 6 D–6F and S6 C). Limiting dilution transplantation assays further confirmed that the abundance of tumorigenic CSCs is significantly higher in KO HMLER ( Figure 6 G). In line with prior evidence that abundance of CSCs correlates with the metastatic potential of breast tumors ( Ginestier et al., 2007 48. Ginestier, C. ∙ Hur, M.H. ∙ Charafe-Jauffret, E. ... ALDH1 is a marker of normal and malignant human mammary stem cells and a predictor of poor clinical outcome Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1 :555-567 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3170) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pece et al., 2010 90. Pece, S. ∙ Tosoni, D. ∙ Confalonieri, S. ... Biological and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers correlates with their cancer stem cell content Cell. 2010; 140 :62-73 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (720) PubMed Google Scholar ), mice injected with KO HMLER or sgXIST HMER-KRAB harbored higher numbers of lung metastases ( Figures 6 H–6K).
To assess MED14 role in the increased tumorigenicity of XIST -depleted cells, we first transduced HMLE/HME-KRAB cells with sgCTRL, sgXIST, or sgXIST + sgMED14 and then transformed them with HRAS G12V . MED14 silencing reduced the proportion of CSCs and SFE of XIST -depleted cells ( Figures 6 L and 6M), in addition to severely disrupting the tumor-initiating capacity of sgXIST HMER ( Figure 6 N). Moreover, CRISPRa-mediated overexpression of MED14 in HMLE with a dCas9-VP64 ( Konermann et al., 2015 67. Konermann, S. ∙ Brigham, M.D. ∙ Trevino, A.E. ... Genome-scale transcriptional activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex Nature. 2015; 517 :583-588 Crossref Scopus (1687) PubMed Google Scholar ) was associated with expansion of CD44 + /CD24 − cells, a phenotype that was further enhanced by transformation with HRAS G12V and phenocopied that of KO HMLER ( Figure S6 D). MED14 overexpression conferred increased SFE to HMLER cells ( Figure S6 E).
In summary, the homeostatic imbalance triggered by XIST loss and MED14 overdosage increases MaSC susceptibility to malignant transformation upon oncogenic activation, favoring the emergence of highly tumorigenic, metastatic breast tumors.
Having shown that depletion of XIST and partial Xi reactivation accelerate tumor growth, we sought to investigate whether loss of XIST and Xi transcriptional labilities is more common among human aggressive breast tumors. For this purpose, we employed two datasets with gene expression and copy-number data: METABRIC ( Curtis et al., 2012 33. Curtis, C. ∙ Shah, S.P. ∙ Chin, S.-F. ... The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel subgroups Nature. 2012; 486 :346-352 Crossref Scopus (3738) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pereira et al., 2016 93. Pereira, B. ∙ Chin, S.-F. ∙ Rueda, O.M. ... The somatic mutation profiles of 2,433 breast cancers refines their genomic and transcriptomic landscapes Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11479 Crossref Scopus (954) PubMed Google Scholar ) and TCGA (Firehose Legacy, The ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, 2020 56. ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes Nature. 2020; 578 :82-93 Crossref Scopus (1079) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of the copy-number alterations (CNAs) of X-linked genes showed high X instability among METABRIC tumors of the Her2 and basal molecular subtypes ( Figures S7 A and S7B), in addition to widespread deletions spanning XIST ( Figure S7 C). To avoid confounding factors due to gross genomic anomalies, we focused on samples with low X instability (CNA in <50% of genes) and an intact XIST locus. Even after this filtering step, XIST was differentially expressed among breast cancer subtypes, with basal and claudin-low tumors showing the lowest levels ( Figures 7 A and 7B). We next defined a cancer escape score to assess the extent of Xi reactivation by combining expression of genes reactivated in KO HMLE (n = 13) and genes escaping XCI in breast cancer cells. The latter consists of a prior classification of cancer-specific escapees (n = 31) ( Chaligné et al., 2015 22. Chaligné, R. ∙ Popova, T. ∙ Mendoza-Parra, M.-A. ... The inactive X chromosome is epigenetically unstable and transcriptionally labile in breast cancer Genome Res. 2015; 25 :488-503 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ), together with X-linked genes showing biallelic expression and/or accumulation of euchromatic histone marks in CAL-51, MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-30, and SUM159 (n = 88). This additional set of cancer-specific escapees was identified through biallelic analysis of public RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq experiments ( Wang et al., 2018b 126.

Levels of the cancer escape score were heterogeneous, and high-expressing samples were found among all molecular subtypes; nonetheless, basal and claudin-low tumors scored the highest for cancer escape ( Figure 7 C). MED14 was also significantly higher among basal tumors when compared with other breast tumor types ( Figure S7 D). We next measured expression of a gene set correlated with poor outcome in breast cancer (MammaPrint; van ’t Veer et al., 2002 119. van ’t Veer, L.J. ∙ Dai, H. ∙ van de Vijver, M.J. ... Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer Nature. 2002; 415 :530-536 Crossref Scopus (7803) PubMed Google Scholar ) after stratifying samples according to the cancer escape score and detected significantly higher expression of this signature among cancer escape high tumors ( Figures 7 D and 7E). The link between cancer escape and bad prognosis was further supported by survival data showing poorer 5-year survival rates among patients with cancer escape high tumors ( Figure S7 E), the small number of samples (high = 181, low = 178) probably contributing to a p value at the edge of statistical significance (p = 0.06). Comparable observations were made with breast tumors of the TCGA dataset ( Figures S7 F–S7N).
Overall, our data suggest that loss of XIST expression and Xi reactivation are common features of breast tumors but are more frequent among the basal and claudin-low subtypes, which are characterized for their high enrichment in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers and stem cell-like features ( Prat et al., 2010 97.

Phenotypic and molecular characterization of the claudin-low intrinsic subtype of breast cancer Breast Cancer Res. 2010; 12 :R68 Crossref Scopus (1528) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, the levels of cancer escape are good indicators of disease outcome.

Section: Discussion

In HMLE, most X-linked genes are unaffected by XIST loss. There is however a small subset that is exquisitely sensitive to XIST coating, clusters around constitutive escapees on the small arm of the X, and often shows variable degrees of escape between cells and tissues. These genes are susceptible to reactivation in other cellular systems and organisms, suggesting conservation of the rules that dictate the dependance on XIST expression. This is best exemplified by the Med14 locus. Genetic deletion of Xist in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and blood cells leads to higher accessibility, remodeling, and transcriptional activity at the Med14 locus on the Xi, as evidenced by increased binding of the chromatin-remodeling complex BRG1 ( Jégu et al., 2019 62. Jégu, T. ∙ Blum, R. ∙ Cochrane, J.C. ... Xist RNA antagonizes the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler BRG1 on the inactive X chromosome Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :96-109 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mRNA upregulation ( Yildirim et al., 2013 131. Yildirim, E. ∙ Kirby, J.E. ∙ Brown, D.E. ... Xist RNA is a potent suppressor of hematologic cancer in mice Cell. 2013; 152 :727-742 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, reprogramming of fibroblasts into iPSc involves rapid depletion of Xist and early reactivation of a subset of X-linked genes, including Med14 ( Cantone et al., 2016 17. Cantone, I. ∙ Bagci, H. ∙ Dormann, D. ... Ordered chromatin changes and human X chromosome reactivation by cell fusion-mediated pluripotent reprogramming Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12354 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Janiszewski et al., 2019 58. Janiszewski, A. ∙ Talon, I. ∙ Chappell, J. ... Dynamic reversal of random X-chromosome inactivation during iPSC reprogramming Genome Res. 2019; 29 :1659-1672 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Variable susceptibility to reactivation might reflect differences in epigenomic features that modulate accessibility to transcription effectors. Reactivated genes are characteristically enriched in H3K27me3 and H2Aub, while being depleted in promoter CpG methylation. This is reminiscent of observations in human iPSc with an epigenetically eroded and partially reactivated Xi, where reactivated genes also display higher levels of H3K27me3 relative to escapees and inactive genes ( Vallot et al., 2015 118. Vallot, C. ∙ Ouimette, J.F. ∙ Makhlouf, M. ... Erosion of X chromosome inactivation in human pluripotent cells initiates with XACT coating and depends on a specific heterochromatin landscape Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16 :533-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, we unveiled a dependency on PRC1, but not on PRC2, of reactivated genes. The functional independence between the two Polycomb complexes might look discrepant with the current model of Polycomb recruitment to the Xi: ncPRC1 > PRC2 > cPRC1. The controversy around this topic, the fact that most research has focused on the initiation phase of mouse XCI, and the lack of conservation between species in the XIST domains responsible for Polycomb recruitment ( Almeida et al., 2017 3. Almeida, M. ∙ Pintacuda, G. ∙ Masui, O. ... PCGF3/5-PRC1 initiates Polycomb recruitment in X chromosome inactivation Science. 2017; 356 :1081-1084 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ) could contribute to this apparent inconsistency. A recent report showed that the fragments of human XIST responsible for enriching the Xi with H2Aub were different from those required for H3K27me3 accumulation. Moreover, chemical inhibition of PRC1 only impacted deposition of H2Aub, whereas inhibition of PRC2 only interfered with accumulation of H3K27me3 ( Dixon-McDougall and Brown, 2021 37. Dixon-McDougall, T. ∙ Brown, C.J. Independent domains for recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2 by human XIST PLoS Genet. 2021; 17 :e1009123 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data are in line with a model where PRC1 and PRC2 operate independently, at least in the context of the Xi in human post-XCI cells. The higher dependency of reactivated genes on PRC1 might also reflect the fact that PRC1 plays a more prominent role than PRC2 in gene silencing during XCI ( Nesterova et al., 2019 87. Nesterova, T.B. ∙ Wei, G. ∙ Coker, H. ... Systematic allelic analysis defines the interplay of key pathways in X chromosome inactivation Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3129 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that PRC1 recruits SMCHD1 to the Xi ( Jansz et al., 2018 60. Jansz, N. ∙ Nesterova, T. ∙ Keniry, A. ... Smchd1 targeting to the inactive X is dependent on the Xist-HnrnpK-PRC1 pathway Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :1912-1923.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), where it mediates higher-order structural changes ( Gdula et al., 2019 45. Gdula, M.R. ∙ Nesterova, T.B. ∙ Pintacuda, G. ... The non-canonical SMC protein SmcHD1 antagonisumbermentalization compartmentalisation on the inactive X chromosome Nat.

SMCHD1 merges chromosome compartments and assists formation of super-structures on the inactive X Cell. 2018; 174 :406-421.e25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Deletion of XIST in mammary epithelial cells impairs MaSC differentiation and favors emergence of highly tumorigenic, metastatic tumors. Disruption of XIST expression or coating has been associated with differentiation defects in human iPSc ( Anguera et al., 2012 5. Anguera, M.C. ∙ Sadreyev, R. ∙ Zhang, Z. ... Molecular signatures of human induced pluripotent stem cells highlight sex differences and cancer genes Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11 :75-90 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the mouse hematopoietic compartment ( Yildirim et al., 2013 131. Yildirim, E. ∙ Kirby, J.E. ∙ Brown, D.E. ... Xist RNA is a potent suppressor of hematologic cancer in mice Cell. 2013; 152 :727-742 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ridings-Figueroa et al., 2017 103. Ridings-Figueroa, R. ∙ Stewart, E.R. ∙ Nesterova, T.B. ... The nuclear matrix protein CIZ1 facilitates localization of Xist RNA to the inactive X-chromosome territory Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :876-888 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Not all cellular compartments are equally susceptible: deletion of Xist in B cells, stratified squamous and glandular epithelia, gut, or brain has no apparent phenotypic consequences under physiological conditions ( Adrianse et al., 2018 2. Adrianse, R.L. ∙ Smith, K. ∙ Gatbonton-Schwager, T. ... Perturbed maintenance of transcriptional repression on the inactive X-chromosome in the mouse brain after Xist deletion Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018; 11 :50 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 130. Yang, L. ∙ Yildirim, E. ∙ Kirby, J.E. ... Widespread organ tolerance to Xist loss and X reactivation except under chronic stress in the gut Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :4262-4272 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, and in line with our data, mice with conditional deletion of Xist in the gut epithelium develop larger gastrointestinal tumors than their WT counterparts when exposed to chronic stress ( Yang et al., 2020 130. Yang, L. ∙ Yildirim, E. ∙ Kirby, J.E. ... Widespread organ tolerance to Xist loss and X reactivation except under chronic stress in the gut Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :4262-4272 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, these observations fit with the concept of cellular pliancy, whereby susceptibility to malignant transformation is related to a cell’s differentiation status. We hypothesize that XIST loss may increase the susceptibility of certain precursors to transformation and thus impact tumor evolution.
Reactivation of MED14 is key to the stabilization of MaSC identity elicited by XIST loss and reflects a pivotal role for Mediator in maintaining stemness. In this regard, in vivo deletion of key Mediator subunits results in depletion of stem/progenitor cell compartments ( Aranda-Orgilles et al., 2016 6. Aranda-Orgilles, B. ∙ Saldaña-Meyer, R. ∙ Wang, E. ... MED12 regulates HSC-specific enhancers independently of mediator kinase activity to control hematopoiesis Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19 :784-799 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Burrows et al., 2015 16. Burrows, J.T. ∙ Pearson, B.J. ∙ Scott, I.C. An in vivo requirement for the mediator subunit med14 in the maintenance of stem cell populations Stem Cell Rep. 2015; 4 :670-684 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas chemically enhanced Mediator function stabilizes the naïve pluripotent state in stem cells ( Lynch et al., 2020 79. Lynch, C.J. ∙ Bernad, R. ∙ Martínez-Val, A. ... Global hyperactivation of enhancers stabilIhuman and mouse naive pluripotency through inhibition of CDK8/19 Mediator kinases Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :1223-1238 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). We report that upregulation of MED14 alone can stabilize the Mediator complex and is associated with hyperactivation of the MaSC enhancer network and defective cell maturation. The widespread sensitivity of MED14 to transcriptional reactivation, together with its crucial role within Mediator, suggest that it could be of relevance in systems other than mammary epithelial cells and therefore deserves further exploration.
Finally, we report widespread loss of XIST and transcriptional activation of the Xi in human breast tumors of all molecular subtypes, with a higher prevalence among the most aggressive tumor types. There is currently a lot of interest in developing therapies that exploit the addiction of cancer cells to the enhancer machinery for cell identity and survival. Inhibitors targeting proteins of the Bromodomain and ExtraTerminal (BET) family (e.g., BRD4) (BETi) have shown some but modest antitumor activity in preclinical models including breast cancer ( Zawistowski et al., 2017 133. Zawistowski, J.S. ∙ Bevill, S.M. ∙ Goulet, D.R. ... Enhancer remodeling during adaptive bypass to MEK inhibition is attenuated by pharmacologic targeting of the P-TEFb complex Cancer Discov. 2017; 7 :302-321 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ; Noblejas-López et al., 2019 88. Noblejas-López, M.D.M. ∙ Nieto-Jimenez, C. ∙ Burgos, M. ... Activity of BET-proteolysis targeting chimeric (Protac) compounds in triple negative breast cancer J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2019; 38 :383 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Richart et al., 2021 102. Richart, L. ∙ Bidard, F.C. ∙ Margueron, R. Enhancer rewiring in tumors: an opportunity for therapeutic intervention Oncogene. 2021; 40 :3475-3491 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ), their implementation likely benefiting from biomarkers to better select candidate patients. Given the resistance of KO MaSC1 to OTX015, we hypothesize that XIST expression might be a useful predictor of sensitivity to BETi in cancer cells. Resistance of XIST -depleted cells to BETi could be due to the increased levels and binding of Mediator to chromatin. Klein and colleagues (2020) 66. Klein, I.A. ∙ Boija, A. ∙ Afeyan, L.K. ... Partitioning of cancer therapeutics in nuclear condensates Science. 2020; 368 :1386-1392 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar hypothesized that MED1-overexpressing breast cancer cells are more resistant to tamoxifen because the drug is diluted and therefore rendered ineffective in the bigger MED1 nuclear condensates, a mechanism that could also contribute to the resistance of KO cells to BETi.
One of the limitations of our study is the fact that we rely on the presence of SNPs on mRNA and small windows around the TSS to predict the transcriptional status of X-linked genes. As a result, we have not been able to determine the status of many genes on the X and may have missed their potential contribution to the differentiation defect of XIST null cells.
Another limitation is the fact that there is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from the same promoter as MED14 but on the opposite strand ( MED14OS ). Our CRISPR-based strategies to manipulate MED14 expression may have affected MED14OS as a result. Natural antisense lncRNAs are regulatory RNAs transcribed from the opposite strand of a protein-coding gene that modulate expression of the sense transcript. We cannot however rule out that this RNA influences expression of genes other than MED14 .

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
The NSG (NOD/SCID/IL2rγnull) mouse colony was purchased from Charles River and grown in-house (CRCM animal core facility). Mice were maintained in individually-ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions and fed standard mouse chow. All experiments were performed under a hood with laminar flow. Mice were not subjected to any procedures prior to the xenotransplantation of human cells. Animal studies were conducted in agreement with the French Guidelines for animal handling and approved by local ethics committee (Agreement no. #16487-2018082108541206 v3).
HEK-293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. HMLE cells were a kind gift from Robert Weinberg (MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA) and were generated by sequential retroviral-mediated expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) and SV40 large T and small t antigens (SV40T/t) in primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). HME cells were gifted by Alain Puisieux (CRCL, Lyon, France) and were generated by overexpressing hTERT in HMECs. Both HMLE and HME were gifted by the labs that originally established these cell lines and were therefore not subjected to authentication. HMLE, but not HME, were subcloned prior to inactivation of XIST to obtain a monoclonal population in terms of X inactivation and be able to conduct allele-specific genomic analyses. Both HMLE and HME were cultured in DMEM:F-12/GlutaMAX™ supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% MEM NEAA, 1% Pen/Strep, 10 μg/mL insulin, 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone, and 10 ng/mL EGF. To induce malignant transformation, HMLE and HME cells were transduced with the lentiviral construct pWPIR-RAS-GFP encoding for oncogenic HRAS G12V and GFP ( Morel et al., 2017 86. Morel, A.P. ∙ Ginestier, C. ∙ Pommier, R.M. ... A stemness-related ZEB1-MSRB3 axis governs cellular pliancy and breast cancer genome stability Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :568-578 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). To select successfully transduced cells, GFP + cells were FACS-sorted in an Aria III instrument (BD Biosciences) and cultured for at least 2 weeks before injection into mouse mammary fat pads.
Mammoplasty samples from three women aged 20 to 43 were produced at Hôpital la Conception and manipulated according to approved IRB protocols of the Paoli-Calmettes Institute (Marseille, France) for research on human subjects. The number of samples employed was influenced by the number of scheduled surgeries. Patients were informed and provided written consent, in compliance with French and European regulation. Normal breast tissue was mechanically and enzymatically dissociated as previously described ( Morel et al., 2017 86. Morel, A.P. ∙ Ginestier, C. ∙ Pommier, R.M. ... A stemness-related ZEB1-MSRB3 axis governs cellular pliancy and breast cancer genome stability Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :568-578 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, tissue samples were minced and disaggregated in DMEM/F-12 with 15 mM HEPES buffer, 2% BSA, 5 mg/ml insulin, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin and 300 U/mL collagenase type 3, at 37°C for 16 h. The epithelial cell-rich pellet was collected by centrifugation at 80xg for 4 min and then washed (1X) with DMEM/F-12. Epithelial organoids were further digested for 5 min with 5 U/mL dispase and the enzymatic digestion was stopped by adding an equal volume of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% FBS. Cells were then filtered through a 40 μm nylon mesh (2X) to generate a single cell suspension and red blood cells were removed by treatment with a solution of ammonium chloride.
To grow organoids from HME-KRAB cells, 1-10 cells were resuspended in 25 μL of Matrigel, seeded on a 48-well plate, and cultured in 300 μL of medium (see table below for details on the composition). Medium was renewed every 2-3 days and pictures were taken after 19 days of culture.

For transduction of HMLE or HME, infectious lentiviruses were produced in HEK-293T by PEI:NaCL-mediated transfection of the lentiviral construct of interest together with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pCMV-VSV-G. Post-transfection (48 h), viral supernatants were collected twice for an additional 48 h, filtered, and either frozen into aliquots or applied onto target cells in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/mL). Successfully transduced cells were selected by FACS-sorting and/or incubation with blasticidin (10 μg/mL) when applicable.
pHMECs are famously difficult to transduce with classic lentivirus, therefore we used the new generation of Baboon envelope pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (BaEV-LVs), as described by Colamartino et al. (2019) 29. Colamartino, A.B.L. ∙ Lemieux, W. ∙ Bifsha, P. ... Efficient and robust NK-cell transduction With baboon envelope pseudotyped Lentivector Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :2873 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar . Viral particles were produced by transfection of psPAX2, BAEV 22, and the plasmid of interest into HEK-293T using Lipofectamine LTX. 48 h post-transfection the virus-containing supernatant was harvested and concentrated 100X using Lenti-X™ Concentrator according to manufacturer’s instructions. The Multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the concentrated virus was calculated by titration on HEK-293T. Viral particles were added at a MOI of 2 to RetroNectin-coated plates (40 μg/mL), which were then centrifuged at 1,000xg for 1 h and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. pHMECs were added to the plates at 1x10 6 cells/mL in 500 μL of mammosphere medium in the presence of protamine-sulfate (20 μg/mL). To increase transduction efficiency, plates were centrifuged at 1,000xg for 1 h and incubated at 37°C o/n. The next day, fresh mammosphere medium was added to each well and pHMECs were maintained in culture for 4 days. Efficiently infected pHMECs (mCherry and BFP double positive) were isolated by FACS-sorting using a BD FACSAria™ III Cell Sorter.
Inactivation of XIST and RING1A was achieved via a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach whereby a STOP cassette encoding for resistance to puromycin was inserted by homologous recombination into the targeted genes ( Wassef et al., 2017 127. Wassef, M. ∙ Luscan, A. ∙ Battistella, A. ... Versatile and precise gene-targeting strategies for functional studies in mammalian cell lines Methods. 2017; 121–122 :45-54 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). High-specificity sgRNAs were designed using the CRISPOR online tool ( Haeussler et al., 2016 51. Haeussler, M. ∙ Schönig, K. ∙ Eckert, H. ... Evaluation of off-target and on-target scoring algorithms and integration into the guide RNA selection tool CRISPOR Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :148 Crossref Scopus (888) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cloned into a gRNA Cloning Vector (Addgene Plasmid #41824; Mali et al., 2013 81. Mali, P. ∙ Yang, L. ∙ Esvelt, K.M. ... RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9 Science. 2013; 339 :823-826 Crossref Scopus (6497) PubMed Google Scholar ). The exact sgRNA sequences and their genomic coordinates are: XIST-KO, 5’- GCAGGTATCCGATACCCCGA-3’ (hg38::chrX:73,852,225-73,852,245); RING1A -KO, 5’-GGACATGCTGAAGAATACGA-3’ (hg38::chr6:33,209,703-33,209,722). To express hCas9, we used the Addgene Plasmid #41815 ( Mali et al., 2013 81. Mali, P. ∙ Yang, L. ∙ Esvelt, K.M. ... RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9 Science. 2013; 339 :823-826 Crossref Scopus (6497) PubMed Google Scholar ) where the neomycin resistance gene was previously excised with DraIII and BstZ17I. The left and right homology arms were cloned into the targeting vector containing a C-KO (constitutive knockout) cassette consisting of a ribosome skipping T2A sequence, the puromycin resistance gene, and two SV40 polyadenylation sequences ( Wassef et al., 2017 127. Wassef, M. ∙ Luscan, A. ∙ Battistella, A. ... Versatile and precise gene-targeting strategies for functional studies in mammalian cell lines Methods. 2017; 121–122 :45-54 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genomic sequences targeted by the homology arms are: XIST-KO, left: hg38::chrX:73,852,258-73,853,263, right: hg38::chrX:73,851,493-73,852,239; RING1A -KO, left: hg38::chr6:33,208,856-33,209,698, right: hg38::chr6:33209784-33210292.
After insertion of the C-KO cassette at the XIST locus, only 467 bp of the XIST transcript are expressed (see Figure S1 B for a genome browser snapshot of RNA-Seq tracks of WT and XIST-KO cells). This small fragment of XIST contains only 2 out of the 8 repeat A units of human XIST . For the exact sequence of the XIST locus after genetic manipulation, see Table S1 .
To generate XIST - or RING1A -KO HMLE clones, cells were co-transfected with sgRNA/Cas9/targeting vectors (1:1:1 ratio) using PEI:NaCL or the HMEC Avalanche™ Transfection Reagent. After puromycin selection (final concentration: 1 μg/mL) for 72 h, cells recovered for 1 week. MaSC1 were then FACS-sorted into 96 well plates (1 cell/well), expanded, and screened for the insertion cassette by PCR on genomic DNA. KO clones were further validated by RT-qPCR and RNA-FISH or Western blotting when applicable.
To silence XIST , HMLE and HME cells were co-transduced with two lentiviral constructs: pHR-SFFV-KRAB-dCas9-mCherry (Addgene Plasmid #60954, Gilbert et al., 2014 47. Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Adamson, B. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-mediated control of gene repression and activation Cell. 2014; 159 :647-661 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1573) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pU6-sgRNA EF1Alpha-puro-T2A-BFP (Addgene Plasmid #60955, Gilbert et al., 2014 47. Gilbert, L.A. ∙ Horlbeck, M.A. ∙ Adamson, B. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-mediated control of gene repression and activation Cell. 2014; 159 :647-661 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1573) PubMed Google Scholar ), the latter encoding a control (5’-GCGCCAAACGTGCCCTGACGG) or an XIST -targeting sgRNA (5’-GCAGCGCTTTAAGAACTGAA). Lentiviral infection was conducted by plating 2 ∗ 10 5 HMLE/HME cells on 6-well plates and incubating them overnight (o/n) with 1 mL of culture medium, polybrene (8 μg/mL), and 5-10 μL of lentivirus. Cells were then washed thrice with PBS and expanded in their usual culture medium. Cell sorting was performed with a FACS Aria III instrument (BD Biosciences) to enrich for mCherry and BFP double positive cells.
To inhibit transcription of candidate genes ( MED14 , PLS3 , RBBP7 , TMEM164 , and USP9X ), control and XIST -silenced HMLE-/HME-KRAB cells were transduced with the lentiviral vector pLKO.1-blast-U6-sgRNA-BfuA1-stuffer encoding 2 sgRNAs per target gene. pLKO.1-blast-U6-sgRNA-BfuA1-stuffer was generated by replacing the puromycin resistance cassette in pLKO.1-puro-U6-sgRNA-BfuA1-stuffer (Addgene Plasmid #50920, Kearns et al., 2014 65. Kearns, N.A. ∙ Genga, R.M.J. ∙ Enuameh, M.S. ... Cas9 effector-mediated regulation of transcription and differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells Development. 2014; 141 :219-223 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a gene encoding for blasticidin resistance. Dual-guide constructs were generated by linearizing pLKO.1-blast-U6-sgRNA-BfuA1-stuffer with BfuA1 and using Gibson assembly to insert a PCR product containing one sgRNA sequence followed by the invariant sgRNA scaffold sequence, a modified murine U6 promoter ( Vidigal and Ventura, 2015 120. Vidigal, J.A. ∙ Ventura, A. Rapid and efficient one-step generation of paired gRNA CRISPR-Cas9 libraries Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8083 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a second sgRNA sequence (for more details on sgRNA sequences, see Table S5 ).
HMLE cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible dCas9-VPR fusion protein were generated through stable integration of PB-TRE-FKBP12DD-dCas9-VPR using the PiggyBac Transposon system. The PB-TRE-FKBP12DD-dCas9-VPR construct was generated by inserting the FKBP12-L106P destabilizing domain (DD) ( Banaszynski et al., 2006 8. Banaszynski, L.A. ∙ Chen, L.-C. ∙ Maynard-Smith, L.A. ... A rapid, reversible, and tunable method to regulate protein function in living cells using synthetic small molecules Cell. 2006; 126 :995-1004 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (621) PubMed Google Scholar ) into PB-TRE-dCas9-VPR (Addgene Plasmid #63800; Chavez et al., 2015 27. Chavez, A. ∙ Scheiman, J. ∙ Vora, S. ... Highly efficient Cas9-mediated transcriptional programming Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :326-328 Crossref Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ) as an N-terminal fusion domain. The hyperactive PiggyBac transposase expression vector pCMV-hyPBase ( Yusa et al., 2011 132. Yusa, K. ∙ Zhou, L. ∙ Li, M.A. ... A hyperactive piggyBac transposase for mammalian applications Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :1531-1536 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ) was a gift from F. Stewart.
Briefly, HMLE cells were transiently co-transfected with PiggyBac transposon/transposase vectors (3:1 ratio) using the HMEC Avalanche™ Transfection Reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions. After selection with hygromycin (500 μg/mL) for 7 days, MaSC1 cells were FACS-sorted into 96 well plates (1 cell/well), expanded, and screened for the insertion cassette by PCR on genomic DNA. Positive clones were further tested by RT-qPCR for their ability to induce expression of dCas9-VPR upon treatment with doxycycline (5 μg/mL) for 48 h. The clone displaying the highest mRNA levels of dCas9-VPR after induction was selected for subsequent experiments. To determine the contribution of reactivation candidates to the differentiation phenotype, HMLE dCas9-VPR cells were further transduced with the lentiviral construct pLKO.1-blast-U6-sgRNA-BfuA1-stuffer encoding one CRISPRa sgRNA per target gene (for more details on sgRNA sequences, see Table S5 ).
MED14 -overexpressing HMLE cells were generated by lentiviral transduction of the dCas9-VP64_GFP construct (Addgene Plasmid #61422, Konermann et al., 2015 67. Konermann, S. ∙ Brigham, M.D. ∙ Trevino, A.E. ... Genome-scale transcriptional activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex Nature. 2015; 517 :583-588 Crossref Scopus (1687) PubMed Google Scholar ), together with the pLKO.1-blast-U6-sgRNA-BfuA1-stuffer plasmid encoding for a CRISPRa sgRNA targeting MED14 (see Table S5 for the sequence of the sgRNA). Control cells were instead transduced with an empty pLKO.1-blast-U6-sgRNA-BfuA1-stuffer vector. Efficiently infected cells were isolated based on their GFP positivity and resistance to blasticidin. Clonal cell populations of control and MED14 -overexpressing HMLE-VP64 were then grown by FACS-sorting MaSC1 cells into 96-well plates (1 cell/well). The resulting clones were scanned by RT-qPCR for their MED14 expression, and the ones with the best overexpression were selected for further analyses.
To investigate the impact of chemical modulation of Mediator activity on cell differentiation, WT MaSC1 cells were FACS-sorted into 96-well plates (2,000-2,500 cells/well) using a SH800S cell sorter (Sony) and incubated with the CDK8 inhibitor 8i (500 nM) ( Lynch et al., 2020 79. Lynch, C.J. ∙ Bernad, R. ∙ Martínez-Val, A. ... Global hyperactivation of enhancers stabilIhuman and mouse naive pluripotency through inhibition of CDK8/19 Mediator kinases Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :1223-1238 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), the BRD4 inhibitor OTX015 (200 nM), or 2% FBS the day after. Control and treated cells were phenotyped every day over the course of 3 days by staining with FACS-grade antibodies against CD49f and ESA and analyzing on a NovoCyte flow cytometer (Agilent).
To assess the sensitivity of WT and XIST-KO HMLER to OTX015, cells were plated on opaque-walled 96-well plates (2,000 cells/well) in medium containing control DMSO, OTX015 200 nM or OTX015 500 nM (2 replicates per condition) and cultured for 96 hours. Cell viability was quantitated with the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay following manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol-Chloroform extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation or with the Maxwell RSC simply RNA Tissue Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA with the High Capacity cDNA RT kit or with the Transcriptase inverse SuperScriptII kit.
Real-time PCR amplification and analysis was conducted with SYBR green on a ViiA7 equipment (Applied Biosystems) or, alternatively, with the TaqMan Universal Master Mix II with UNG on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). RNA levels were normalized to HPRT and GAPDH or ACTB expression using the ΔΔCt method. To quantify allelic skewing, cDNA was amplified using biotinylated primers and subsequently sequenced using Q24 Pyromark. Primer sequences are provided in Table S5 .
RNA-FISH was performed as described previously ( Chaumeil et al., 2002 26. Chaumeil, J. ∙ Okamoto, I. ∙ Guggiari, M. ... Integrated kinetics of X chromosome inactivation in differentiating embryonic stem cells Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2002; 99 :75-84 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were grown on coverslips for two days. Then, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and permeabilized for 5 min with ice-cold permeabilization buffer [PBS 1X, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mM Ribonucleoside Vanadyl Complex (VRC)]. Fixed cells were preserved in 70% EtOH at -20°C. Samples were dehydrated in 4 baths of increasing ethanol concentration (80%, 95%, 100% twice) and air-dried quickly. For nascent transcript detection by RNA FISH, intron-spanning BAC and Fosmid probes (RPCI-11 and WIBR-2 libraries) were used (for more details, see key resources table ). Probes were labelled with SpectrumGreen or SpectrumRed dUTPs by nick translation following manufacturer’s recommendations. Labelled probes were co-precipitated with human COT-1 DNA in the presence of salmon sperm, NaOAc, and ice-cold 70% EtOH. Precipitated DNA was then resuspended in formamide, denatured at 75°C for 10 min, and competed at 37°C for 1 h. Probes were co-hybridized in FISH hybridization buffer (50% Formamide, 20% Dextran sulfate, 2X SSC, 1 μg/μL BSA, 10 mM VRC) at 37°C o/n. The next day, hybridized coverslips were washed three times for 5 min with 50% formamide in 2X SSC at 42°C, and three times for 5 min with 2X SSC. Coverslips were mounted with DAPI-containing VECTASHIELD® Antifade Mounting Medium and images were acquired using an Inverted Spinning disk Confocal Microscope with FRAP module (Roper/Nikon).
Phenotyping of HMLE and HME cells was done by staining with the following FACS-grade primary antibodies for 15 min at 4°C: anti-ESA conjugated to APC (dilution 1:120) or FITC (dilution 1:200), anti-CD49f conjugated to FITC (dilution 1:40) or APC (dilution 1:200), anti-CD44 conjugated to APC (dilution 1:10) or e450 (dilution 1:100), and anti-CD24 conjugated to PE-Cya7 (dilution 1:100) or PE (dilution 1:10). For more details on the antibodies, see key resources table . Cells were then analyzed on a LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences).
For the clonogenic differentiation assays, MaSC1 (CD49f + /ESA - ), MaSC2 (CD49f - /ESA - ), and ML (CD49f + /ESA + ) cells were sorted into 96-well plates (1 cell/well) using a FACS Aria III instrument (BD Biosciences). After 2-3 weeks, confluent clones were phenotyped by staining against ESA and CD49f and analyzed on a LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences). Clones were classified according to the proportion of ML cells as ‘differentiated’ (>10% ML) or ‘undifferentiated’ (<10% ML). To assess viability, cells were stained with the Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (dilution 1:1000) for 15 min.
HMLE and HME-KRAB cells were plated on ultra-low-attachment 96-well plates (pre-coated with Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) at 56°C o/n) in serum-free mammary epithelial basal medium (MEBM) supplemented with B-27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic, 1 ng/mL hydrocortisone, 5 μg/mL insulin, and 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Frequency of MaSC with mammosphere-forming ability was determined following the guidelines of the Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) ( Hu and Smyth, 2009 55. Hu, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ELDA: extreme limiting dilution analysis for comparing depleted and enriched populations in stem cell and other assays J. Immunol. Methods. 2009; 347 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (1311) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a range of cells (1 to 2000) was plated in each well, and the number of wells containing at least one mammosphere was computed after 10-15 days of culture. 20 to 80 wells were evaluated per condition.
To evaluate the sphere-forming efficiency of HMLE and HME-KRAB transformed with HRAS G12V , cells were plated and grown in the same conditions as the non-transformed cell lines. However, the number of cells plated to estimate CSC frequency ranged from 1 to 100, and 20 to 40 wells were evaluated per condition.
WT and XIST-KO MaSC and ML cells were FACS-sorted into culture plates and expanded for 48 h. Cells were then passed and plated on top of glass coverslips. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Samples were washed in PBS once and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. Primary antibody incubation with anti-MED1 (1:50) was performed in blocking solution o/n at 4°C. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution. The excess of secondary antibody was washed away three times with PBS and coverslips were mounted with DAPI-containing VECTASHIELD® Antifade Mounting Medium. Images were acquired using a Super Resolution OMX (Applied Precision Incorporation) microscope. To measure the volume of MED1 foci, images in 3D were processed using the public domain program Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 104. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (31040) PubMed Google Scholar ) in combination with the plugin 3D Object Counter ( Bolte and Cordelières, 2006 13. Bolte, S. ∙ Cordelières, F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy J. Microsc. 2006; 224 :213-232 Crossref Scopus (3270) PubMed Google Scholar ). Objects were intensity threshold-ed using an automatic threshold ( Tsai 1985 116. Tsai, W.H. Moment-preserving thresholding: a new approach Comput. Vision Graphics Image Process. 1985; 29 :377-393 Crossref Google Scholar ).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 2-5 μm formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections by the ICEP platform (CRCM, France). IHC staining intensity was scored as negative or positive. Mammary epithelial outgrowths were considered positive when >30% of duct cells were positive. For more details on primary antibodies, see key resources table .
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50mM Tris HCl pH=8, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Following sonication, clearing by centrifugation, and protein determination, equal amounts of protein per sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies diluted in PBS-T, 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed and incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of fluorophore- (Starbright700) or peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2h at RT. Blots were visualized using the BIORAD ChemiDoc MP or the Amersham ECL Detection Reagent kit. Dilutions of primary antibodies used in this study: MED14 (1:1000 dil.), USP9X (1:2000 dil.), RBBP7 (1:1000 dil.), PLS3 (1:2000 dil.), MED1 (1:1000 dil.), MED22 (1:300 dil.), MED31 (1:1000 dil.), CDK8 (1:2000 dil), MED15 (1:500 dil.), MED26 (1:1000 dil.), RING1A (1:1000 dil.), RING1B (1:1000 dil.), H2AK119Ub1 (1:3000 dil.), H3K27me3 (1:3000 dil.), Total H3 (1:3000 dil.), ACTINβ (1:2000 dil.), TUBULINβ (1:2000 dil.), RAS (G12V mutant) (1:500 dil.), ERK2 (1:1000 dil.), and P-ERK (1:2000 dil.).
For the mammary repopulating assays, HME-KRAB cells were injected orthotopically into humanized, cleared fat pads of NSG mice, as described previously ( Morel et al., 2017 86. Morel, A.P. ∙ Ginestier, C. ∙ Pommier, R.M. ... A stemness-related ZEB1-MSRB3 axis governs cellular pliancy and breast cancer genome stability Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :568-578 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inoculated mice were euthanized 18-24 weeks post-implantation, and each fat pad was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. To assess the outgrowth potential of each condition (sgCTRL, sgXIST, sgXIST:sgMED14), we analyzed 40-90 sections per fat pad. Hematoxylin Erythrosine Saffron (Masson’s HES) staining was performed on every tenth serial section and the number of ductal structures was computed (5-10 slides/fat pad). Based on the number of outgrowths, MaSC frequency was calculated with the ELDA algorithm ( Hu and Smyth, 2009 55. Hu, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ELDA: extreme limiting dilution analysis for comparing depleted and enriched populations in stem cell and other assays J. Immunol. Methods. 2009; 347 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (1311) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To evaluate the tumorigenicity of HMLE and HME-KRAB transformed with HRAS G12V , cells were injected orthotopically into fat pads of NSG mice (250,000 HMLER or 1,000,000 HMER cells into one fat pad per mouse) and tumor growth was monitored. Mice were considered as tumor-bearing when tumor size reached 100 mm 3 .
For the metastasis assays, primary tumors were resected when they reached 300-500 mm 3 . Mice were sacrificed according to ethical guidelines, either 210 days after cells injection or when they showed signs of metastatic disease (difficulty in breathing or weight loss). Mice lungs were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. To assess the metastatic potential of each condition (HMLER WT/KO and HMER sgCTRL/sgXIST), we analyzed between 1 and 60 sections per lung (60 sections being required to analyze the whole lung). Hematoxylin Erythrosine Saffron (Masson’s HES) staining was performed on every tenth serial section and mice were considered as lung metastasis-bearing each time a metastasis was found on, at least, one slide.
Genomic DNA from HMLE cells was isolated using the NucleoSpin Tissue, Mini kit for DNA from cells and tissue. WGS libraries were prepared by the Institut Curie Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility using the TruSeq DNA PCR-free Library Prep Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (PE100).
After trimming, reads were aligned to the reference genome using BWA-MEM (v 0.7.15) ( Li, 2013 72. Li, H. Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA-MEM Preprint at arXiv. 2013; Crossref Google Scholar ) with default parameters. To simplify downstream analyses, reads that mapped to the X chromosome were retrieved using SAMtools view (v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 73. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (32152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Variant calling was performed using Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) HaplotypeCaller ( DePristo et al., 2011 35. DePristo, M.A. ∙ Banks, E. ∙ Poplin, R. ... A framework for variation discovery and genotyping using next-generation DNA sequencing data Nat. Genet. 2011; 43 :491-498 Crossref Scopus (7184) PubMed Google Scholar ). GATK Best Practices for short variant discovery ( https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices ) were implemented for base quality score recalibration, indel realignment, and duplicate removal. Heterozygous SNPs were identified using GATK SelectVariants and annotated using ANNOVAR (v20141110) ( Wang et al., 2010 125. Wang, K. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Hakonarson, H. ANNOVAR: functional annotation of genetic variants from high-throughput sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :e164 Crossref Scopus (8025) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For analysis of HMLE, three independent biological replicates of MaSC (ESA - ) and ML (ESA + ) cells were isolated by FACS-sorting from WT and XIST-KO cells. For analysis of HMLER, one round of FACS-sorting was conducted to isolate CD44 + /CD24 - CSCs from WT and XIST-KO cells. Total RNA was extracted as described above and its quality was assessed by Tapestation (only samples with RIN score > 8 were considered for sequencing). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Swift RNA Library Kit (Swift Biosciences, Cat#R1024 and R1096) according to manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (PE100). Both sets of libraries were sequenced at the Institut Curie Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility.
The fasta file of the human reference genome hg19 was first masked with the list of heterozygous SNPs on chromosomes 2 and X identified by variant calling on the WGS data using BEDtools maskfasta (v2.2.2) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 98. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (11943) PubMed Google Scholar ) so that all polymorphic sites would be masked by the ambiguity nucleobase ‘N’. Adapters and low-quality bases (<Q20) were removed from reads with TrimGalore (v0.4.0) and Cutadapt (v1.8.2) ( Martin, 2011 84. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet J. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ). Trimmed reads were then aligned to the “N-masked” reference genome using the gene annotation from GENCODE (Release 19/GRCh37.p13) and the STAR (v2.7.0a) aligner ( Dobin and Gingeras, 2015 38. Dobin, A. ∙ Gingeras, T.R. Mapping RNA-seq reads with STAR Curr. Protoc. Bioinform. 2015; 51 :11.14.1-11.14.19 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the parameters --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 --outSAMattributes NH HI NM MD --alignEndsType EndToEnd. For the analysis of gene expression, reads overlapping exons or genes (GENCODE Release 19/GRCh37.p13) were counted using FeatureCounts (Subread v1.5.1) ( Liao et al., 2014 74. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (9225) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the allele-specific analyses, PCR duplicates were removed from mapped reads using Picard tools (v1.97) and valid reads were then split by allele using SNPsplit (v0.3.2) ( Krueger and Andrews, 2016 69. Krueger, F. ∙ Andrews, S.R. SNPsplit: allele-specific splitting of alignments between genomes with known SNP genotypes F1000Res. 2016; 5 :1479 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads overlapping informative SNPs were quantified using SAMtools (v1.9) mpileup ( Li et al., 2009 73. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (32152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only SNPs with at least 8 overlapping reads per allele were kept for subsequent analyses. For each informative SNP, and since our SNP calls are not phased, we first calculated an allelic ratio (AR) and then its absolute distance to 0.5. The values of this pseudo AR range from 0 to 0.5, where 0 means a gene is bi-allelically expressed, and 0.5 means expression is completely parentally biased. For each gene, we averaged the pseudo AR values of all informative SNPs within.
Differential expression analysis comparing WT versus XIST -KO HMLE was performed with DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 77. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (33579) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each cell compartment, all expressed genes were pre-ranked according to their fold-change. Pre-ranked gene lists were then tested by GSEA for their enrichment on the sets of genes linked to enhancers with significant differences in H3K27Ac ( Figure 5 D). To test the impact of XIST loss on the networks of transcription factors (TFs) and target genes that drive cell differentiation in HMLE, we first identified genes differentially expressed between WT MaSC and ML cells and selected the top 500 enriched in each compartment. We then built protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the cell compartment-specific genes with STRING ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 113. Szklarczyk, D. ∙ Gable, A.L. ∙ Lyon, D. ... STRING v11: protein-protein association networks with increased coverage, supporting functional discovery in genome-wide experimental datasets Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D607-D613 Crossref Scopus (7933) PubMed Google Scholar ) and searched for TF motifs enriched on their promoters using the iRegulon module ( Janky et al., 2014 59. Janky, R. ∙ Verfaillie, A. ∙ Imrichová, H. ... iRegulon: from a gene list to a gene regulatory network using large motif and track collections PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10 :e1003731 Crossref Scopus (518) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in Cytoscape ( Shannon et al., 2003 105. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (25943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, we plotted the PPI networks of the TF that were themselves differentially expressed during cell maturation and their targets using Cytoscape. The nodes in each PPI network were color-coded according to the differential expression between WT and XIST-KO cells. Finally, the PPI networks were scanned for significant enrichment of GO terms and kegg pathways using STRING.
Cut&Run was performed as described previously ( Skene et al., 2018 110. Skene, P.J. ∙ Henikoff, J.G. ∙ Henikoff, S. Targeted in situ genome-wide profiling with high efficiency for low cell numbers Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :1006-1019 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 4-5 ∗ 10 5 HMLE cells were washed twice with Wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH=7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were then resuspended in Binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH=7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCl2) containing 10 μL of blocked BioMag®Plus Concanavalin A-coated beads. After 10 min at RT, cells:beads were transferred to 50 μL of Antibody solution (1:100 dilution of primary antibody in Wash buffer plus 0.1% digitonin) and incubated for 1 h at RT on an end-to-end rotator. Cells:beads were washed three times with Wash buffer-0.1% digitonin and incubated for 10 min with pA-MNase diluted in Wash buffer-0.1% digitonin. After three washes in Wash buffer-0.1% digitonin, tubes were placed in an ice/water bath and equilibrated to 0°C for 10 min. To trigger digestion of the DNA, CaCl 2 was added (2 mM final concentration) for 30 min. Digestion was stopped by addition of 2X STOP buffer (340 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 4 mM EGTA, 0.02% digitonin, 1:200 Rnase A [50 μg/mL final concentration]). Digested DNA fragments were released from cells by incubating sample tubes on a heat block at 37 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was then recovered by placing tubes on a magnetic stand and DNA was purified using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean‑up kit.
Cut&Run-Seq libraries were prepared using the Accel-NGS 2S Plus DNA library kit according to manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 (PE100) at the Institut Curie Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility.
Two independent biological replicates were generated per genotype and cellular compartment for each Cut&Run-Seq experiment.
Adapters and low-quality bases (<Q20) were removed from reads with TrimGalore (v0.4.0) and Cutadapt (v1.8.2) ( Martin, 2011 84. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet J. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ). Trimmed fastq files were then aligned to the human reference genome hg19 using the Bowtie2 aligner (v2.2.5) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 70. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (26715) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. PCR duplicates were discarded using Picard tools (v1.97).
BigWig files were created using DeepTools bamCoverage (v3.0.2) ( Ramírez et al., 2014 99. Ramírez, F. ∙ Dündar, F. ∙ Diehl, S. ... deepTools: a flexible platform for exploring deep-sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W187-W191 Crossref Scopus (1282) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following parameters: --normalizeUsingRPKM –ignoreForNormalization chrX chrY –samFlagInclude 64 –binSize 10 (H3K4me3/H3K4me1/H3K27Ac) or 30 (H3K27me3/H2Aub) –extendReads. Reads overlapping problematic, blacklisted regions (wgEncodeDacMapabilityConsensusExcludable.bed) ( Amemiya et al., 2019 4. Amemiya, H.M. ∙ Kundaje, A. ∙ Boyle, A.P. The ENCODE blacklist: identification of problematic regions of the genome Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :9354 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ) were excluded from the computation of coverage with the option ----blackListFileName. BigWig files of biological replicates were merged with UCSC tools (v2017.05.03) bigWigMerge and bedGraphToBigWig.
Peak calling for H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac Cut&Run-Seq data was done on bam files without PCR duplicates using MACS2 (v2.0.10) callpeak ( Zhang et al., 2008 135. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (8723) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the following parameters: -p 1e-05 –broad –broad-cutoff 1e-03.
To map enhancers in HMLE, consensus lists of H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac peaks were generated by pooling together data from all compartments and genotypes. Overlapping peaks were merged using BEDtools merge (v2.2.2) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 98. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (11943) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the consensus lists for H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 were intersected using BEDtools intersect (v2.2.2) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 98. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (11943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peaks were annotated using HOMER annotatePeaks.pl (v4.3) ( Heinz et al., 2010 52. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6458) PubMed Google Scholar ) and those within TSS ± 3kb windows were excluded. MaSC-specific enhancers were either exclusively found in MaSC cells or showed significantly higher levels of H3K27Ac in MaSC cells (Log 2 FC >= 1; FDR < 0.1). ML-specific enhancers were only detected in ML cells or showed significantly higher levels of H3K27Ac in ML cells (Log 2 FC >= 1; FDR < 0.1). Common enhancers were found in both cell compartments and showed no statistically significant differences in terms of H3K27Ac accumulation.
To identify enhancers with differential enrichment of H3K27Ac between WT and XIST-KO HMLE, we performed DESeq2 analysis ( Love et al., 2014 77. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (33579) PubMed Google Scholar ) on library size-normalized read counts retrieved with FeatureCounts (Subread v1.5.1) ( Liao et al., 2014 74. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (9225) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential accumulation of H3K27Ac was considered significant when Log 2 FC >= 1 | Log 2 FC <= -1 and FDR < 0.1. Genes regulated by enhancers displaying significant changes in H3K27Ac were predicted with GREAT (( McLean et al., 2010 85. McLean, C.Y. ∙ Bristor, D. ∙ Hiller, M. ... GREAT improves functional interpretation of cis-regulatory regions Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :495-501 Crossref Scopus (2526) PubMed Google Scholar ). GREAT associates genomic regions with genes by defining a ‘regulatory domain’ for each gene in the genome. The regulatory domain of a given gene consists of a basal domain that goes from the 5kb upstream to the 1kb downstream of its TSS, which is then extended up to the basal domain of the nearest upstream and downstream genes within 1Mb. The rationale behind the 1Mb threshold is based on Hi-C data showing that promoter-enhancer contacts are mostly confined within Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), or ∼1Mb regions of preferential intra-domain interactions ( Nora et al., 2012 89. Nora, E.P. ∙ Lajoie, B.R. ∙ Schulz, E.G. ... Spatial partitioning of the regulatory landscape of the X-inactivation centre Nature. 2012; 485 :381-385 Crossref Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dixon et al., 2012 36. Dixon, J.R. ∙ Selvaraj, S. ∙ Yue, F. ... Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions Nature. 2012; 485 :376-380 Crossref Scopus (4027) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rao et al., 2014 100. Rao, S.S.P. ∙ Huntley, M.H. ∙ Durand, N.C. ... A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014; 159 :1665-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3686) PubMed Google Scholar ). By providing GREAT with the genomic coordinates of differentially enriched enhancers, we retrieve a list of genes in whose regulatory domains the enhancers lie.
For the allele-specific analysis of H3K27Ac and H3K4me3 Cut&Run-Seq data, trimmed fastq files were aligned to an N-masked version of the human reference genome hg19 at positions of heterozygous SNPs on chromosome X using the Bowtie2 aligner (v2.2.5) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 70. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (26715) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the parameters -q -N 1 -L 22 –end-to-end. PCR duplicates were discarded using Picard tools (v1.97) and valid reads were split by allele using SNPsplit (v0.3.2) ( Krueger and Andrews, 2016 69. Krueger, F. ∙ Andrews, S.R. SNPsplit: allele-specific splitting of alignments between genomes with known SNP genotypes F1000Res. 2016; 5 :1479 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads overlapping heterozygous SNPs were quantified using SAMtools (v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 73. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (32152) PubMed Google Scholar ) mpileup. Only SNPs with at least 8 overlapping reads per allele that fell within TSS ± 3kb were considered informative and kept for subsequent analyses. For each informative SNP, and since our SNP calls are not phased, we first calculated an AR and then its absolute distance to 0.5. The values of this pseudo AR range from 0 to 0.5, where 0 means accumulation of a given histone mark is equal for the two alleles, and 0.5 means accumulation is fully parentally biased. For each gene, we averaged the pseudo AR values of all informative SNPs within its promoter (TSS ± 3kb).
ChIP-Seq for MED1 was performed as previously described ( Holoch et al., 2021 53. Holoch, D. ∙ Wassef, M. ∙ Lövkvist, C. ... A cis-acting mechanism mediates transcriptional memory at Polycomb target genes in mammals Nat. Genet. 2021; 53 :1686-1697 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Briefly, WT and KO MaSC HMLE were FACS-sorted and expanded in culture for 72 h before being cross-linked in the culture dishes by incubation at RT in pre-warmed (37°C) cross-linking medium (DMEM supplemented with 15 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.9, 15 mM NaCl, 0.15 mM EDTA, 0.075 mM EGTA and 1% formaldehyde). After 10 min, the cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of 0.125 M glycine at RT for 5 min. Cells were then rinsed with cold PBS, scraped from the dishes, and transferred to 50-mL conical tubes, pelleted, and washed again in PBS. Next, cells were lysed by incubation at 4°C for 10 min in 1 mL buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors). Nuclei were pelleted, resuspended in 1 mL of buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA plus protease inhibitors) and rocked at RT for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted again, resuspended in 1.3 mL of buffer 3 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5% N-lauroyl-sarcosine supplemented with protease inhibitors) and sonicated using a pre-cooled Diagenode Bioruptor for 30 min (30 s ON/30 s OFF). Solubilized chromatin was recovered by centrifuging at 20,000xg and saving the supernatant. To determine chromatin concentration, 20 μL of chromatin extract were de-crosslinked o/n at 65°C in 180 μL of T 50 E 10 S 1 (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) and were purified the next day by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. 10 μg of chromatin per sample were used to immunoprecipitate MED1. Sample volumes were equalized using buffer 3. For each sample, 50 μL of Protein A Dynabeads slurry were washed in 500 μL 0.5% BSA in PBS (3X) and then rocked at 4°C for several hours in 200 μL 0.5% BSA in PBS and 10 μg of MED1 antibody. Just prior to the IP, 0.5 volume buffer 4 (15 mM EDTA, 3% Triton X-100, 0.3% sodium deoxycholate with protease inhibitors) was added to each chromatin sample, and 1/10th of the resulting volume was set aside as input. For each sample, Dynabeads were washed in 500 μL 0.5% BSA in PBS (3X), resuspended in 50 μL of a 2:1 mixture of buffers 3 and 4, and added to the chromatin extract. After an o/n IP at 4°C (on a rotating wheel), beads were washed 6X in 0.4 mL ice-cold buffer 5 (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 0.5 M LiCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.7% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40 with protease inhibitors), with 2 min RT rotation per wash, and 1X in 0.4 mL 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. Precipitated chromatin was then eluted by incubating beads in 200 μL T 50 E 10 S 1 at 65°C for 30 min (with vigorous shaking). The IP chromatin samples and the input were incubated o/n at 65°C to reverse cross-links, and then treated with 80 μg of Rnase A at 37°C for 1 h and 40 μg of proteinase K at 55°C for 1 h. DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform and precipitated in ethanol.
ChIP-Seq libraries were prepared using the Accel-NGS 2S Plus DNA library kit and sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 (PE100) at the Institut Curie Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility.
ChIP-Seq libraries were aligned to hg19 using Bowtie2 (v2.2.5) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 70. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (26715) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. PCR duplicates were removed with Picard Tools (v1.97) MarkDuplicates. BigWig files were created using DeepTools bamCoverage (v3.0.2) ( Ramírez et al., 2014 99.

Datasets containing either ChIP-Seq or ATAC-Seq experiments were used to identify heterozygous SNPs on the X chromosome and define the inactivation status of X-linked genes with informative SNPs. Briefly, for each dataset, samples were independently aligned against the reference genome using BWA-MEM (v0.7.15) ( Li, 2013 72. Li, H. Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA-MEM Preprint at arXiv. 2013; Crossref Google Scholar ) with default parameters. To simplify downstream analyses, reads mapped to the X chromosome were retrieved using SAMtools view (v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 73. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (32152) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCR duplicates were then discarded using Picard tools (v1.97) MarkDuplicates. Once all samples were aligned, BAM files were merged and indexed using SAMtools (v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 73. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (32152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Variant calling was performed on the merged BAM file using the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode ( DePristo et al., 2011 35. DePristo, M.A. ∙ Banks, E. ∙ Poplin, R. ... A framework for variation discovery and genotyping using next-generation DNA sequencing data Nat. Genet. 2011; 43 :491-498 Crossref Scopus (7184) PubMed Google Scholar ). GATK Best Practices for short variant discovery ( https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices ) were implemented for base quality score recalibration and indel realignment. The GVCF files for all datasets were combined into one single GVCF and variant calling was then performed jointly on the cohort of datasets using GATK GenotypeGVCF. The raw variant call set was further filtered by variant quality score recalibration with GATK VariantRecalibrator and ApplyRecalibration. Finally, heterozygous SNPs were identified using GATK SelectVariants and used to mask the reference genome hg19 with BEDtools maskfasta (v2.2.2) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 98. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (11943) PubMed Google Scholar ).
ChIP-Seq of histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27Ac, and H3K4me1) or RNA Pol II, ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments were then analyzed in an allele-specific manner to determine the XCI status of X-linked genes. ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq fastq files were aligned to the masked reference genome using the Bowtie2 aligner (v2.2.5) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 70. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (26715) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the parameters -q -N 1 -L 22 –end-to-end. PCR duplicates were discarded using Picard tools (v1.97), and the remaining reads were then split by allele using SNPsplit (v0.3.2) ( Krueger and Andrews, 2016 69. Krueger, F. ∙ Andrews, S.R. SNPsplit: allele-specific splitting of alignments between genomes with known SNP genotypes F1000Res. 2016; 5 :1479 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which uses SAMtools (v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 73. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (32152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads overlapping informative SNPs were quantified using SAMtools (v1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 73. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (32152) PubMed Google Scholar ) mpileup. RNA-Seq data was processed similarly but were mapped to the reference genome with STAR (v2.7.0a) ( Dobin and Gingeras, 2015 38. Dobin, A. ∙ Gingeras, T.R. Mapping RNA-seq reads with STAR Curr. Protoc. Bioinform. 2015; 51 :11.14.1-11.14.19 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ) instead of Bowtie2 (parameters: --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 –outSAMattributes NH HI NM MD –alignEndsType EndToEnd).
Only SNPs with at least 5 overlapping reads per allele were considered informative. When analyzing ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq experiments, we focused on SNPs within ±3kb of the TSS; when analyzing RNA-Seq data, we focused on SNPs inside gene bodies. For each informative SNP, and since our SNP calls are not phased, we first calculated an allelic ratio (AR) and then its absolute distance to 0.5. The values of this pseudo AR range from 0 to 0.5, where 0 means the two alleles are comparable in terms of accumulation of histone modifications/chromatin factors or gene expression, and 0.5 means there is a complete parental bias (maternal or paternal). For each gene, we averaged the pseudo AR values of all overlapping informative SNPs. The pseudo AR values of X-linked genes for the 4 breast cancer cell lines can be found in Table S4 .
Gene expression and copy number information from two public datasets of human breast cancer was retrieved through cBioportal ( Cerami et al., 2012 20. Cerami, E. ∙ Gao, J. ∙ Dogrusoz, U. ... The cBio cancer genomics portal: an open platform for exploring multidimensional cancer genomics data Cancer Discov. 2012; 2 :401-404 Crossref Scopus (9571) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gao et al., 2013 43. Gao, J. ∙ Aksoy, B.A. ∙ Dogrusoz, U. ... Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal Sci. Signal. 2013; 6 :pl1 Crossref Scopus (8862) PubMed Google Scholar ): METABRIC ( Curtis et al., 2012 33. Curtis, C. ∙ Shah, S.P. ∙ Chin, S.-F. ... The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel subgroups Nature. 2012; 486 :346-352 Crossref Scopus (3738) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pereira et al., 2016 93. Pereira, B. ∙ Chin, S.-F. ∙ Rueda, O.M. ... The somatic mutation profiles of 2,433 breast cancers refines their genomic and transcriptomic landscapes Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11479 Crossref Scopus (954) PubMed Google Scholar ) and TCGA Firehose Legacy ( The ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, 2020 56. ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes Nature. 2020; 578 :82-93 Crossref Scopus (1079) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The PAM50 intrinsic molecular subtyping of tumors in the TCGA dataset was determined using the genefu Bioconductor library ( Gendoo et al., 2016 46. Gendoo, D.M. ∙ Ratanasirigulchai, N. ∙ Schröder, M.S. ... Genefu: computation of gene expression-based signatures in breast cancer Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :1097-1099 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Molecular classification of samples in the METABRIC dataset was predetermined and part of the clinical information available at cBioportal. t-SNE plots were drawn with the M3C Bioconductor library ( John et al., 2020 63. John, C.R. ∙ Watson, D. ∙ Russ, D. ... M3C: A Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering algorithm Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :1816 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on expression of the top 500 more variable genes.
For each tumor in the TCGA dataset, expression of the 4 normal breast signatures (MaSC, LP, ML, and stroma) ( Lim et al., 2009 75. Lim, E. ∙ Vaillant, F. ∙ Wu, D. ... Aberrant luminal progenitors as the candidate target population for basal tumor development in BRCA1 mutation carriers Nat. Med. 2009; 15 :907-913 Crossref Scopus (1034) PubMed Google Scholar ) was computed by subtracting the mean expression of down-regulated genes from the mean expression of up-regulated genes. Samples were then identified by the gene signature for which they had the highest expression. 322 luminal A tumors with predominant expression of stromal markers were removed from the dataset since they correspond to samples with a strong desmoplastic reaction and very few tumoral cells.
To understand the prevalence of XIST loss and transcription reactivation of the Xi in human breast cancer, and to avoid confounding factors such as gross genomic instability, we discarded tumors with deletions spanning the XIST locus and/or with copy number alterations in more than 50% of X-linked genes. Only after removal of tumors with high X chromosome genomic instability, we investigated expression of XIST , MED14 , cancer escapees, and the poor prognosis signature (MammaPrint™; van ’t Veer et al., 2002 119. van ’t Veer, L.J. ∙ Dai, H. ∙ van de Vijver, M.J. ... Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer Nature. 2002; 415 :530-536 Crossref Scopus (7803) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The cancer escape score was calculated by combining expression of: 12 3) genes reactivated in XIST-KO HMLE (n = 13) ( Table S2 ),) cancer-specific escapees in the breast cancer cell lines ZR-75-1, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-436 (n = 31) ( Chaligné et al., 2015 22. Chaligné, R. ∙ Popova, T. ∙ Mendoza-Parra, M.-A. ... The inactive X chromosome is epigenetically unstable and transcriptionally labile in breast cancer Genome Res. 2015; 25 :488-503 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ) cancer-specific escapees in the breast cancer cell lines CAL-51, MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-30, and SUM159 (n = 88) ( Table S4 ). The resulting values were Z-score normalized.
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6. Two-tailed Student’s t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used to do pair-wise comparisons. When using Student’s t tests, F tests were conducted to compare variances and D’Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality tests were employed to determine whether data followed a Gaussian distribution. All statistical tests, resulting P values, and observation numbers are indicated in the figure panels or in the figure legends. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. ELDA ( Hu and Smyth, 2009 55. Hu, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ELDA: extreme limiting dilution analysis for comparing depleted and enriched populations in stem cell and other assays J. Immunol. Methods. 2009; 347 :70-78 Crossref Scopus (1311) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to evaluate both MaSC and CSC frequency and to determine the statistical significance.
