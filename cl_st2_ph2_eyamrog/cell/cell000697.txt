Title: En masse organoid phenotyping informs metabolic-associated genetic susceptibility to NASH


Abstract: Summary

Genotype-phenotype associations for common diseases are often compounded by pleiotropy and metabolic state. Here, we devised a pooled human organoid-panel of steatohepatitis to investigate the impact of metabolic status on genotype-phenotype association. En masse population-based phenotypic analysis under insulin insensitive conditions predicted key non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-genetic factors including the glucokinase regulatory protein ( GCKR )-rs1260326:C>T. Analysis of NASH clinical cohorts revealed that GCKR -rs1260326-T allele elevates disease severity only under diabetic state but protects from fibrosis under non-diabetic states. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, and pharmacological analyses indicate significant mitochondrial dysfunction incurred by GCKR -rs1260326, which was not reversed with metformin. Uncoupling oxidative mechanisms mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction and permitted adaptation to increased fatty acid supply while protecting against oxidant stress, forming a basis for future therapeutic approaches for diabetic NASH. Thus, “in-a-dish ” genotype-phenotype association strategies disentangle the opposing roles of metabolic-associated gene variant functions and offer a rich mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic inference toolbox toward precision hepatology.

Section: Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease affecting billions of people worldwide. The prevalence of NAFLD globally is 25.24%, with wide geographical variation, ranging from 6.3% to 33% depending on the population, ethnicity, lifestyle, and method of diagnosis ( Bellentani et al., 2010 5. Bellentani, S. ∙ Scaglioni, F. ∙ Marino, M. ... Epidemiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Dig. Dis. 2010; 28 :155-161 Crossref Scopus (762) PubMed Google Scholar ; Everhart and Bambha, 2010 11. Everhart, J.E. ∙ Bambha, K.M.

Vernon, G. ∙ Baranova, A. ∙ Younossi, Z.M. Systematic review: the epidemiology and natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in adults Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2011; 34 :274-285 Crossref Scopus (2523) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even in children, hepatic steatosis has become increasingly recognized, from 13% to 17% depending on age group, and, interestingly, without the increase of visceral adipose tissue for those less than the age of 9.8, indicating potential genetic contributors. Given that steatosis in childhood can lead to a higher incidence of mortality from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver diseases, and malignancy ( Paik et al., 2022 40. Paik, J.M. ∙ Kabbara, K. ∙ Eberly, K.E. ... Global burden of NAFLD and chronic liver disease among adolescents and young adults Hepatology. 2022; 75 :1204-1217 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ), earlier prediction and detection of pathogenic NAFLD is a priority public health challenge. In adults, susceptibility to NAFLD/NASH is highly variable as not all individuals who are obese develop steatosis, and most cases of steatosis do not progress to chronic liver disease. Thus, there remains a critical need to better understand the susceptibility of vulnerable populations toward future preventive and therapeutic strategies ( Tomita et al., 2017 60. Tomita, K. ∙ Kohli, R. ∙ MacLaurin, B.L. ... Mixed-lineage kinase 3 pharmacological inhibition attenuates murine nonalcoholic steatohepatitis JCI Insight. 2017; 2 :94488 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although our understanding of the genetic underpinnings in many diseases has advanced ( Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005 19. Hirschhorn, J.N. ∙ Daly, M.J. Genome-wide association studies for common diseases and complex traits Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6 :95-108 Crossref Scopus (2251) PubMed Google Scholar ), known risk variants explain only a modest fraction of heritability in common metabolic disorders such as NAFLD ( Loomba et al., 2015 34. Loomba, R. ∙ Schork, N. ∙ Chen, C.H. ... Heritability of Hepatic Fibrosis and Steatosis Based on a Prospective Twin Study Gastroenterology. 2015; 149 :1784-1793 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genetic pleiotropy, when intersected with metabolic traits and disorders, further complicates the genetic interpretation of pathogenicity. The major comorbidity of NAFLD is type 2 diabetes (T2D), a prevalent and rapidly growing metabolic disease. In the USA, the co-prevalence of NAFLD and T2D ranges from 32% to 90%, depending on the age group ( Younossi et al., 2020 69. Younossi, Z.M. ∙ Tampi, R.P. ∙ Racila, A. ... Economic and Clinical Burden of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes in the U.S Diabetes Care. 2020; 43 :283-289 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because NAFLD and T2D are often present in the same patients, the contributions of the many different genetic variants identified to date for each clinical phenotype remain to be established.
The glucokinase regulatory protein ( GCKR ) rs1260326:C>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is one such coding variant. GCKR is expressed almost exclusively in liver hepatocytes ( Chambers et al., 2011 7. Chambers, J.C. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Sehmi, J. ... Genome-wide association study identifies loci influencing concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma Nat. Genet. 2011; 43 :1131-1138 Crossref Scopus (443) PubMed Google Scholar ; Speliotes et al., 2011 54. Speliotes, E.K. ∙ Yerges-Armstrong, L.M. ∙ Wu, J. ... Genome-wide association analysis identifies variants associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that have distinct effects on metabolic traits PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 , e1001324 Crossref Scopus (794) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is recognized to play a critical role in glucose utilization and lipogenesis ( Nozaki et al., 2020 36.

USA. 2020; 117 :8166-8176 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). SNP rs1260326 association with NAFLD is widely debated ( Anstee et al., 2020 2. Anstee, Q.M. ∙ Darlay, R. ∙ Cockell, S. ...

Hepatol. 2019; 7 :297-303 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), partly due to its genetic pleiotropy ( Yeh et al., 2022 67. Yeh, K.H. ∙ Hsu, L.A. ∙ Teng, M.S. ... Pleiotropic Effects of Common and Rare GCKR Exonic Mutations on Cardiometabolic Traits Genes. 2022; 13 :491 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ): e.g., protection from T2D and chronic kidney disease, with an increased risk of NAFLD, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, gout, and metabolic syndrome ( Zain et al., 2015 70. Zain, S.M. ∙ Mohamed, Z. ∙ Mohamed, R. A common variant in the glucokinase regulatory gene rs780094 and risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A meta-analysis J. Gastroenterol.

Rationale for Gene-Based Personalized NAFLD Treatment Front. Pharmacol. 2019; 10 :877 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). In support, a recent unbiased deep-phenotype genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified the same GCKR variant as one of only a handful of genomic variants ( MHC , ALDH2, ATXN2/SH2B3 , ABO loci) that was associated with broader traits (28 and 20 traits in European and Japanese populations, respectively), including T2D ( Sakaue et al., 2021 49. Sakaue, S. ∙ Kanai, M. ∙ Tanigawa, Y. ... A cross-population atlas of genetic associations for 220 human phenotypes Nat. Genet. 2021; 53 :1415-1424 Crossref Scopus (617) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, a complete understanding of the pleiotropic roles of candidate variants like GCKR -rs1260326 is essential for more insightful diagnosis and prognosis, particularly for highly heterogeneous metabolic diseases like NAFLD.
"In-a-dish” organ systems are being envisioned as models that allow genotype and phenotype association studies under a defined metabolic context in the absence of other major confounding factors. Recent GWAS-in-a-dish approaches, using metabolic cell types differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have validated human gene expression variation such as gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) ( Kilpinen et al., 2017 25. Kilpinen, H. ∙ Goncalves, A. ∙ Leha, A. ... Common genetic variation drives molecular heterogeneity in human iPSCs Nature. 2017; 546 :370-375 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ). Emerging organoid-based approaches can further increase the potential of this in-a-dish strategy as organoids emulate anatomical and physiological characteristics of in vivo organs in health and disease ( Takebe and Wells, 2019 58. Takebe, T. ∙ Wells, J.M. Organoids by design Science. 2019; 364 :956-959 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, human liver organoid cultures consist of apico-basolaterally polarized hepatocytes with bile canaliculi-like architecture and can maintain the directional bile acid excretion pathway for several weeks ( Ramli et al., 2020 43. Ramli, M.N.B. ∙ Lim, Y.S. ∙ Koe, C.T. ...

High-Fidelity Drug-Induced Liver Injury Screen Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Organoids Gastroenterology. 2021; 160 :831-846.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). This microarchitecture enabled the modeling of cholestatic damage induced by drugs and was purposed for a population-based study to delineate novel polygenic architectures of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) ( Koido et al., 2020 29. Koido, M. ∙ Kawakami, E. ∙ Fukumura, J. ... Polygenic architecture informs potential vulnerability to drug-induced liver injury Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1541-1548 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies highlight the potential of in-a-dish based genomics approach in predicting metabolic dysfunction associated with human phenotype at a targeted organ level.
We previously established organoid-based simple steatosis ( Kimura et al., 2018 27. Kimura, M. ∙ Azuma, M. ∙ Zhang, R.R. ... Digitalized Human Organoid for Wireless Phenotyping iScience. 2018; 4 :294-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) and steatohepatitis ( Ouchi et al., 2019 39. Ouchi, R. ∙ Togo, S. ∙ Kimura, M. ... Modeling steatohepatitis in humans with pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :374-384.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) models that contain essential stromal lineages involving stellate- and Kupffer-like cells. Herein, we devised a pooled human population organoid panel (PoP) for steatohepatitis genotype-phenotype association studies. Steatohepatitis-like organoids from multiple genotyped individuals could be phenotyped under insulin-insensitive conditions, enabling efficient evaluation of genetic association with diabetic NAFLD. Organoid-informed genetic and molecular mechanisms were integrated with extensive clinical data obtained during three randomized controlled trials of therapies for patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH ( Harrison et al., 2020 17. Harrison, S.A. ∙ Wong, V.W.S. ∙ Okanoue, T. ... Selonsertib for patients with bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis due to NASH: Results from randomized phase III STELLAR trials J.

Combination Therapies Including Cilofexor and Firsocostat for Bridging Fibrosis and Cirrhosis Attributable to NASH Hepatology. 2021; 73 :625-643 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). This revealed that the pleiotropic effects of the GCKR -rs1260326:C>T variant ( Shen et al., 2009 52. Shen, H. ∙ Pollin, T.I. ∙ Damcott, C.M. ... Glucokinase regulatory protein gene polymorphism affects postprandial lipemic response in a dietary intervention study Hum. Genet. 2009; 126 :567-574 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) , ( Pollin et al., 2011 42. Pollin, T.I. ∙ Jablonski, K.A. ∙ McAteer, J.B. ... Triglyceride response to an intensive lifestyle intervention is enhanced in carriers of the GCKR Pro446Leu polymorphism J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 96 :E1142-E1147 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) are clinically significant for concomitant NAFLD and T2D, with revelations from organoid models that the functional significance of the variant is dependent on the metabolic status and influences the inflammatory milieu. We propose that metabolically resolved genetic and phenotypic assessments are critical to identifying appropriate biomarkers and tailoring interventional strategies.

Section: Results

Numerous common genomic SNP variants associated with NAFLD/NASH have been identified by GWAS, with the significance most evident for the PNPLA3 -rs738409 SNP. However, for the vast majority of SNPs, the significance remains unclear. We recently reported that human liver organoids (HLOs) from iPSCs are effective for modeling inflammatory diseases such as DILI ( Shinozawa et al., 2021 53. Shinozawa, T. ∙ Kimura, M. ∙ Cai, Y. ... High-Fidelity Drug-Induced Liver Injury Screen Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Organoids Gastroenterology. 2021; 160 :831-846.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) and NAFLD ( Kimura et al., 2018 27. Kimura, M. ∙ Azuma, M. ∙ Zhang, R.R. ... Digitalized Human Organoid for Wireless Phenotyping iScience. 2018; 4 :294-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ouchi et al., 2019 39. Ouchi, R. ∙ Togo, S. ∙ Kimura, M. ... Modeling steatohepatitis in humans with pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :374-384.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we posit that the HLOs could be used to screen for clinically relevant NAFLD/NASH phenotype-genotype associations in different metabolic states. To assess the genotype-phenotype correlation between known significant GWAS SNPs for steatosis, and lipid accumulation phenotypes in our steatohepatitis-like HLO (sHLO), we evaluated an HLO panel of 24 donor iPSC lines of varying genotypes ( Table S1 ). This number of lines was based on a recent Monte Carlo simulation that suggested for an event predicted to occur 1 in 10 patients, a cohort of 24 human iPSC lines would yield a 92% probability that the event will be identified ( Fermini et al., 2018 13. Fermini, B. ∙ Coyne, S.T. ∙ Coyne, K.P. Clinical Trials in a Dish: A Perspective on the Coming Revolution in Drug Development SLAS Discov. 2018; 23 :765-776 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To expedite and facilitate comparative analyses of 24 donor HLOs, we improved our iPSC differentiation protocol to develop an en masse strategy (schematically depicted in Figure 1 A). We discovered that dissociating iPSC-derived foregut (FG) progenitor clusters to single cells before embedding in Matrigel can generate single donor-derived HLO. The single FG progenitor cells, furthermore, could be cryopreserved without affecting viability or differentiation capabilities. Together with improved culturing conditions, we took advantage of our clonal differentiation protocol to generate a PoP by a mixed population of cryopreserved FG progenitors from 24 donors. The multicellular composition of the pooled HLO was evaluated by scRNA-seq ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). Consistent with our previous publications ( Ouchi et al., 2019 39. Ouchi, R. ∙ Togo, S. ∙ Kimura, M. ... Modeling steatohepatitis in humans with pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :374-384.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shinozawa et al., 2021 53. Shinozawa, T. ∙ Kimura, M. ∙ Cai, Y. ... High-Fidelity Drug-Induced Liver Injury Screen Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Organoids Gastroenterology. 2021; 160 :831-846.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ), our protocols enabled paralleled production of hepatocyte-like, macrophage-like, and stellate-like cells ( Figures S1 A and S1B).
Derivation of pooled HLOs from single donor cells was confirmed in each organoid by (1) discernable identity based on unique SNP PCR genotyping of the donors ( Figures S1 C and S1D) and consistent morphology ( Figure S1 E) and (2) lack of organoid chimerism where >90% of HLOs carried single donor-derived SNPs ( Figure S1 F). Further gene expression analysis of the differentiated pooled 24 FG progenitors showed relatively minimal donor-dependent variations of hepatic gene markers, which were distinct from iPSC and FG, but similar to primary hepatocytes ( Figure 1 B). Expression of the markers in the clonally differentiated HLOs, moreover, was consistent with the individual donor-derived HLOs ( Figure 1 B). Although there were some variations among individual donor-derived HLOs in the expression of genes encoding ATP-binding cassette transporters for drug clearance ( BSEP = ABCB11 ; MRP3 = ABCC3 ), expression of the key hepatic markers, albumin ( ALB ), a member of cytochrome P450 superfamily CYP2C9 , and tryptophan 2.3-dioxygenase TD O 2 , were comparable ( Figure 1 B). Thus, we developed the PoP as a viable strategy for enabling en masse generation of the genetically diverse HLO panel.
To generate a NAFLD phenotype in the PoP HLOs, we cultured them with the common fatty acid, oleic acid (OA), which reproducibly induced steatohepatitis-like pathologies of lipid and metabolite accumulation ( Figures S2 A–S2G) and inflammation ( Figures S2 H and S2I) as previously reported ( Ouchi et al., 2019 39. Ouchi, R. ∙ Togo, S. ∙ Kimura, M. ... Modeling steatohepatitis in humans with pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :374-384.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). There was a marked difference in the amount of cholesterol and triglyceride secreted into the culture supernatant ( Figure S2 F). Moreover, mass-spectrometry (MS) analysis quantified an increase in lipogenesis and lipid oxidation markers in the sHLOs, including both acetyl-CoA (lipogenic precursor) and palmitate (saturated lipid), as well as mid- and long-chain acyl-carnitines, e.g ., octanoyl-carnitine (C8 medium chain) and palmitoyl-carnitine (C16 long chain), indicating impaired lipid oxidation ( Figure S2 G). Enhanced inflammatory cytokine production consistent with a steatohepatitis-like phenotype was also detected in OA-treated HLOs ( Figures S2 H and S2I). Moreover, the OA-treated sHLOs exhibited perturbed gluconeogenesis ( Figures S2 J and S2K) and impaired production of glucose response to insulin ( Figures S2 L and S2M), reminiscent of NASH patients who often show hepatic insulin resistance ( Samuel and Shulman, 2019 50. Samuel, V.T. ∙ Shulman, G.I. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Insulin Resistance, and Ceramides N. Engl. J. Med. 2019; 381 :1866-1869 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, our OA-induced PoP model replicates insulin-insensitive NASH-like traits accompanied by increased lipogenesis, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and elevated inflammation.
With evidence supporting steatohepatitis-like phenotype in the sHLO, we next sought to leverage our en masse steatosis quantification strategy to determine whether the organoid-based genotype-phenotype association could predict common NAFLD-associated SNP genotypes. Live BODIPY imaging of lipid droplet staining in OA-treated PoP HLOs allowed us to quantitate a hepatosteatosis index and distinguish lipid-low accumulating HLOs from lipid-high accumulators ( Figure 1 C). Each donor carried multiple SNPs ( Figure 1 D) with odds ratio (OR) analyses (combination of 2 and 1 alleles) showing strong correlations between the HLO lipid accumulation phenotype and the most reported risk SNPs; specifically, the PNPLA3 -rs738409 ( Donati et al., 2016 10. Donati, B. ∙ Motta, B.M. ∙ Pingitore, P. ... The rs2294918 E434K variant modulates patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 expression and liver damage Hepatology. 2016; 63 :787-798 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ) and GCKR -rs780094 and -rs1260326 ( Keebler et al., 2010 23. Keebler, M.E. ∙ Deo, R.C. ∙ Surti, A. ... Fine-mapping in African Americans of 8 recently discovered genetic loci for plasma lipids: the Jackson Heart Study Circ. Cardiovasc. Genet. 2010; 3 :358-364 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) risk alleles ( Figure 1 E). Only GCKR-rs1260326 allelic status is shown in Figure 1 C. The ORs were statistically insignificant for other reported SNPs in our HLO model system ( Figure 1 E), including the TM6SF2 -rs58542926 risk alleles. Because our HLO sample size is small, it is possible that the very low allelic frequency of some of these known SNPs may not be readily captured (e.g., for TM6SF2 -rs58542926, frequency T = 0.065365, GnomAD exome).
It was notable that none of the 24 donors carried two alleles of the well-established PNPLA3 -rs738409 risk SNP. Yet, the OR determined by heterozygosity was still statistically significant and comparable to those calculated from hundreds to thousands of patients in multiple clinical studies ( Figure 1 F). Interestingly, in our HLO model, the OR of GCKR -rs1260326 was as significant as PNPLA3 -rs738409 ( Figure 1 E). Clinical significance of GCKR -rs1260326, in contrast, ranged from relatively modest to not significant and had a calculated OR decidedly less significant than our HLO model ( Figure 1 G). These results indicate that our PoP model offers a human-based system to evaluate the pathophysiological significance of potential risk SNPs and, importantly, can inform steatotic genotype-phenotype correlations for NAFLD/NASH.
GCKR -rs1260326:C>T is a functional coding SNP, c.1337C>T, in which the C to T substitution alters the proline at position 446 to leucine (p.Pro446Leu), whereas GCKR -rs780094, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1260326 ( Santoro et al., 2012 51. Santoro, N. ∙ Zhang, C.K. ∙ Zhao, H. ... Variant in the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene is associated with fatty liver in obese children and adolescents Hepatology. 2012; 55 :781-789 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ; Speliotes et al., 2011 54. Speliotes, E.K. ∙ Yerges-Armstrong, L.M. ∙ Wu, J. ... Genome-wide association analysis identifies variants associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that have distinct effects on metabolic traits PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 , e1001324 Crossref Scopus (794) PubMed Google Scholar ), is intronic and non-functional. In the liver, GCKR competes with glucose for binding to glucokinase (GCK) and, upon binding, inactivates GCK, in part by retaining GCK in the nucleus (schematically depicted in Figure 2 A). The GCKR -rs1260326 TT variant, which has a reduced ability to bind GCK ( Beer et al., 2009 3. Beer, N.L. ∙ Tribble, N.D. ∙ McCulloch, L.J. ... The P446L variant in GCKR associated with fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride levels exerts its effect through increased glucokinase activity in liver Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18 :4081-4088 Crossref Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ), has been proposed to constitutively activate hepatic glucose uptake and glycolysis with the subsequent generation of excess acetyl-CoA, a rate-limiting substrate for lipogenesis ( Beer et al., 2009 3. Beer, N.L. ∙ Tribble, N.D. ∙ McCulloch, L.J. ... The P446L variant in GCKR associated with fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride levels exerts its effect through increased glucokinase activity in liver Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18 :4081-4088 Crossref Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To assess the pathogenesis of the GCKR -rs1260326 TT variant (hereafter referred to as GCKR TT ) in our HLO model, we selected three GCKR TT donor iPSC lines for further analyses, comparing to four GCKR -rs1260326 CC variant ( GCKR CC ) iPSC lines. We also gene-edited several GCKR CC iPSC lines to GCKR TT ( GCKR CC>TT ) to specifically test the causative impact of this SNP in an isogenic background ( Figure S3 ). Three GCKR CC>TT donor iPSC lines (#038, #039, and #040) were selected for further analyses, and compared to their cognate GCKR CC donor iPSC lines ( Table S1 ). GCK activity in the GCKR TT and GCKR CC>TT HLOs was consistently higher than in the isogenic GCKR CC HLOs ( Figures 2 B and 2C). We next evaluated whether the higher GCK activity enhanced de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Steady-state hepatic lipid metabolism under standard high glucose and high insulin culture conditions without exogenous fatty acid loading required prolonged culturing time, and thus HLOs were analyzed on day 30. BODIPY imaging analysis showed that GCKR TT and GCKR CC>TT HLOs generated and accumulated significantly more lipid droplets compared to GCKR CC HLOs ( Figures 2 D and 2E). The fact that GCKR TT HLO has more lipid than GCKR CC>TT indicates the contribution of other disease modifiers. MS analysis further showed that acetyl-CoA and palmitate were significantly increased in GCKR TT HLOs ( Figure 2 F), which correlated with the enhanced expression of lipogenesis genes including Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 ( SREBP1) , ATP citrate lyase ( ACLY), Fatty Acid Synthase ( FASN ), and Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) ( Figure 2 G). Thus, the GCKR -rs1260326 TT variant causatively facilitated GCK enzyme activation, lipid droplet formation, and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids accumulation, concordant with increased expression of genes associated with de novo lipogenesis due to excess acetyl-CoA.
To further evaluate the pathogenesis of dysfunctional GCK-GCKR binding, we treated HLOs with PFK15, a 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFKB3) inhibitor, and AMG3969, which disrupts GCK-GCKR binding, and evaluated the effects on de novo fat accumulation ( Figures 2 H and 2I). PFK15 should increase Fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and consequently suppress GCK activity and inhibit hepatic glycolysis ( Beer et al., 2009 3. Beer, N.L. ∙ Tribble, N.D. ∙ McCulloch, L.J. ... The P446L variant in GCKR associated with fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride levels exerts its effect through increased glucokinase activity in liver Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18 :4081-4088 Crossref Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas AMG3969 treatment should result in the release and migration of GCK into the cytoplasm from the nucleus, independent of glucose availability, thus enhancing glycolysis and lipogenesis ( Lloyd et al., 2013 32. Lloyd, D.J. ∙ St Jean, Jr., D.J. ∙ Kurzeja, R.J.M. ... Antidiabetic effects of glucokinase regulatory protein small-molecule disruptors Nature. 2013; 504 :437-440 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). As predicted, inhibition of GCK activity prevented inhibited lipid accumulation, although this was more obvious with GCKR TT HLOs, which had higher basal lipid profiles ( Figure 2 I). Inhibition of GCK-GCKR complex formation by AMG3969, on the contrary, significantly enhanced lipid droplet accumulation in both GCKR CC and GCKR TT HLOs ( Figures 2 H and 2I). Notably, the maximum lipid droplets detected in GCKR CC HLOs were consistently below untreated GCKR TT HLOs ( Figure 2 I). Our results suggest that, in HLO models, the GCKR TT variant, independent of PNPLA3 -rs738409, is functionally associated with de novo fat accumulation phenotype in the absence of exogenous fat-induced lipogenesis.
The discrepant metabolic impact of the GCKR TT variant between our sHLO model and highly variable clinical reports raised the question of whether other comorbid metabolic traits, such as the onset of diabetes-like symptoms including insulin resistance, should be taken into consideration when evaluating the clinical impacts of GCKR -rs1260326 alleles. Indeed, the cultured conditions (high glucose and high insulin) for our HLO models are most consistent with NAFLD/NASH and T2D phenotypes and explain the blunted responses to insulin under steatotic conditions, independent of risk variant status ( Figure S2 ).
For in vivo assessments, we performed a retrospective analysis on a cohort of 1,091 adults diagnosed with biopsy-proven NASH (STELLAR-3 trial, NCT03053050; ATLAS-trial, NCT03449446) for which demographics, biomarkers, and liver histology of clinical samples were available ( Table S2 ). Demographics were predominantly Caucasian, middle-aged, females with high BMI in the obese range. Correlation analyses between NAFLD clinical parameters and genetic risk variants in the cohort focused on the GCKR -rs1260326 variant compared to the most prevalent risk variants in PNPLA3 , MBOAT7 , and TM6SF2 ( Table 1 and Figure 3 A). Measurements included accepted markers of liver injury (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), histological grading of NAFLD/NASH pathology (NAFLD activity score, [NAS]; lobular inflammation, [LI]; Steatosis, Activity and Fibrosis, [SAF]; for ballooning and LI). The well-established pathogenic PNPLA3 -rs738409 GG risk variant (c.444C>G, p.I148M), as expected, was associated with higher ALT levels (although still within normal ranges) when compared to the reference CC variant ( Table 1 ), but was comparable between reference and risk variants in GCKR , MBOAT7 and TM6SF2 . All variants’ histological analyses were indistinguishable and within pathological ranges ( Table 1 ).
It is of note that fasting glucose (normal: <99 mg/dL; prediabetes: 100–125 mg/dL; diabetes: >126 mg/dL) and fasting insulin levels (normal: <25 uIU/ml) were generally above normal ranges, irrespective of variants, consistent with indications of insulin resistance ( Table S2 ). We therefore performed additional association analysis with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) data available for 1,089 of the 1,091 subjects ( Table 1 ). HbA1c is a common measurement in T2D diagnosis. HbA1c measures glycated hemoglobin and, unlike fasting glucose, reflects a weighted average of blood glucose levels in the preceding 2–4 months. Specifically, HbA1c cutoff values recommended for adults by the CDC (Center for Disease Control), USA, were used, where below 5.7% is within normal ranges; 5.7–6.4%, pre-diabetic; and >6.4%, diabetic. Analyses showed that when HbA1c values were in the diabetic >6.4% ranges for PNPLA3 -rs728409, the GG risk variant (compared to reference CC) was significantly associated with increased ALT, increased SAF score, but histological NAS and LI were not significantly different ( Table 1 and Figure 3 A).
In patients carrying the GCKR TT variant, ALT, NAS, LI, and SAF scores were significantly better (i.e., lower scoring) than reference GCKR CC when HbA1c values were within normal <5.7% ranges ( Table 1 and Figures 3 A–3E). In stark contrast, when HbA1c values were in the diabetic >6.4% range, scoring was higher (i.e., indicative of worsened pathology) in GCKR TT versus GCKR CC cohorts ( Figures 3 A–3E). This worsening of NAFLD/NASH inflammatory pathology was most pronounced within the GCKR TT cohort, when comparing the non-diabetic HbA1c <5.7% to the diabetic HbA1c >6.4% sub-cohorts ( Figures 3 B–3E). For the GCKR CC variant, diabetic HbA1c >6.4% conditions did not worsen inflammatory pathology but trended toward improved (lower) scores ( Figures 3 B–3E). In sum, based on differential HbA1c values, the GCKR TT variant appears to confer unexpected inverse risks for inflammatory pathology, trends not observed with the other genetic risk variants evaluated ( Table 1 and Figure 3 A), for example, the PNPLA3 -rs728409 GG risk variant ( Figures S4 A–S4D). Thus, for patients carrying the GCKR TT variant, HbA1c measurements may have prognostic value for delineating the severity of NAFLD-associated inflammatory pathology.
To assess GCKR TT cellular impacts, we performed an unbiased transcriptomic analysis of available RNA-seq datasets from genotyped patient hepatocyte samples ( Tables S3 and S4 ). In GCKR TT NASH hepatocytes compared to hepatocytes carrying GCKR CC or CT , differential expression gene (DEG) analyses by edgeR (Fold-change [FC] > 1.50, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) revealed upregulated genes including lipogenic genes ( Figure 4 A). This is remarkably consistent with OA-induced sHLO models comparing GCKR CC and TT ( Figures S5 A–S5E and Table S4 ). Intriguingly, downregulated genes included multiple subunits of the mitochondrial ATP synthase ( Figure 4 A), a membrane multimeric complex which utilizes the electrochemical proton gradient during oxidative phosphorylation to catalyze ATP synthesis from ADP. The dysregulation of mitochondrial gene sets was also identified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)-REACTOME analysis ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Though upregulated pathways included inflammatory gene sets in our sHLO models ( Figures S5 F–S5H and Table S4 ), several mitochondrial-related pathways were downregulated, with NES values among the top downregulated REACTOME pathways ( Figure 4 B). When comparing these GCKR TT NASH hepatocyte samples to GCKR TT HLO models, a similar subset of GSEA-REACTOME pathways was significantly downregulated ( Figure 4 C), most prominent of which were the mitochondrial-related REACTOME pathways ( Figure 4 D). The downregulation of respiratory electron transport ATP synthesis pathways was also supported by enrichment plot analyses demonstrating that these metabolic gene sets were significantly different between GCKR TT and GCKR CC with p < 0.001 in both NASH hepatocytes from patients and the HLO models ( Figure 4 E).
Given the transcriptomic indications of mitochondrial dysregulation associated with the GCKR TT variant compared to GCKR CC , and the correlation between clinical GCKR TT NASH hepatocytes and our HLO models, we sought to verify if the mitochondrial function was perturbed in our HLO models. Typically, mitochondrial aerobic respiration relies on electron transfer and a proton gradient to drive ATP production, with reactive oxygen species (ROS) as natural, tightly controlled by-products. We hypothesized that in our HLO systems, mitochondrial dysregulation was a consequence of enhanced oxidative stress created by chronic ROS production in GCKR TT variant cells, which was exacerbated by fatty acid accumulation. We showed that oxygen consumption rates (OCR), determined by a fluorescence-based assay, were significantly compromised in GCKR TT sHLOs compared to GCKR TT HLOs ( Figure 4 F). Further, ATP/AMP ratios determined by intracellular metabolite profiling were dramatically reduced in GCKR TT sHLOs compared to GCKR CC sHLOs ( Figure 4 G). These results were consistent with enhanced ROS, quantified by live cell staining, in GCKR TT sHLOs compared to GCKR CC sHLOs ( Figure 4 H).
To evaluate the effect on mitophagy in GCKR TT sHLOs by quantifying intracellular mitophagy dye, sHLOs exhibited similar fluorescence intensity to controls ( Figure S6 A). Flow cytometry indicated that the relative protein levels of mitophagy-related proteins parkin (PRKN) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) were increased in sHLOs, although only the increase in MFN2 was statistically significant ( Figure S6 B). We also evaluated mtDNA copy number to assess the possibility of mitochondrial disposal by mitophagy in steatosis condition. Transmission electron microscopy and mtDNA copy number analyses confirmed the increased presence of mitochondria in OA-treated sHLOs ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Altogether, our HLO and sHLO models revealed mitochondrial dysregulation rather than reduction, driven by genetic GCKR TT risk factors and exogenous fatty acid perturbations.
Metformin, the first line of medication used to treat T2D associated with obesity, has been shown to improve mitochondrial respiratory activities via the AMPK pathway in mouse models ( Wang et al., 2019 63. Wang, Y. ∙ An, H. ∙ Liu, T. ... Metformin Improves Mitochondrial Respiratory Activity through Activation of AMPK Cell Rep. 2019; 29 :1511-1523.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, patients carrying GCKR TT did not show improvement in multiple phenotypic measurements after 48 weeks of metformin treatment, in contrast to patients carrying GCKR CC or CT ( Table S5 and Figure S4 E). Hence, we infer that in vivo , metabolic dysfunction associated with GCKR TT , including potential mitochondrial dysregulation, is unlikely to improve with metformin treatment. To determine if our HLO model reflected these in vivo observations, we evaluated the effects of metformin treatment in sHLOs and assessed whether controlling elevated ROS in GCKR TT sHLOs can better modulate the undesirable effects of excessive fatty acid accumulation.
Among the mechanisms to control the unwanted generation of ROS, we focused on uncoupling the oxidative phosphorylation process. Specifically, GCKR TT sHLOs were supplemented with an NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), in combination with nitazoxanide (NTZ), an FDA-approved anti-parasitic and anti-viral drug recently shown to possess mitochondrial uncoupling and respiration-enhancing, activities ( Amireddy et al., 2017 1. Amireddy, N. ∙ Puttapaka, S.N. ∙ Vinnakota, R.L. ... The unintended mitochondrial uncoupling effects of the FDA-approved anti-helminth drug nitazoxanide mitigates experimental parkinsonism in mice J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :15731-15743 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sahdeo et al., 2014 48. Sahdeo, S. ∙ Tomilov, A. ∙ Komachi, K. ... High-throughput screening of FDA-approved drugs using oxygen biosensor plates reveals secondary mitofunctional effects Mitochondrion. 2014; 17 :116-125 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first demonstrated the effects of NR and NTZ in our GCKR TT HLO systems. GCKR TT sHLOs exposed to fatty acids dramatically reduced OCR, which NR and NTZ co-treatment reversed ( Figure 5 A). This restoration of energy consumption in GCKR TT sHLOs to comparable levels detected in GCKR TT HLOs was due to the synergistic effects of NR and NTZ in increasing NAD+ availability ( Figure 5 B). NAD+, the metabolic co-factor involved in redox reactions, is known to protect hepatocytes from the harmful effects of ROS ( Guarino and Dufour, 2019 15. Guarino, M. ∙ Dufour, J.F. Nicotinamide and NAFLD: Is There Nothing New Under the Sun? Metabolites. 2019; 9 :180 Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar ).
We confirmed that ROS production was significantly higher in GCKR TT sHLOs than in GCKR TT HLOs ( Figures 5 C and 5D). In contrast, metformin treatment did not reduce, but actually increased, ROS, which may exacerbate the disease phenotype ( Figure 5 D). In contrast to metformin, co-treatment with NR and NTZ significantly decreased cellular ROS ( Figure 5 D) without affecting mtDNA copy number ( Figure S6 D). To investigate the effect of NR/NTZ on HLOs in the absence of free fatty acids (FFAs), co-treatment of NR and NTZ was performed. The results showed that HLOs without FFAs reduced mitochondrial ROS production ( Figure S6 E). We also observed a concomitant decreased DNL gene expression ( Figure 5 E) and suppression of fatty acid-induced inflammatory gene expression ( Figure 5 F). Collectively, the susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction conferred by the GCKR TT variant and fatty acid exposure could be mitigated by oxidative uncoupling that permits adaptation to increased fatty acid supply while granting protection against oxidant stress.

Section: Discussion

“GWAS in-a-dish” is a potential strategy to determine the personalized phenotypes in a collection of cells from multiple individuals ( Kimura et al., 2018 27. Kimura, M. ∙ Azuma, M. ∙ Zhang, R.R. ... Digitalized Human Organoid for Wireless Phenotyping iScience. 2018; 4 :294-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). This report integrated the GWAS in-a-dish concept with a PoP-based functional approach ( Takebe and Wells, 2019 58. Takebe, T. ∙ Wells, J.M. Organoids by design Science. 2019; 364 :956-959 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ) to capture pathological genetic variations associated with NAFLD/NASH. Our in vitro manipulatable approach for evaluating heritable variants circumvented the numerous in vivo non-heritable confounders, including lifestyle and nutrition, which perturb NAFLD/NASH and other metabolism-dependent diseases, leading to controversial interpretations of discovered variants. The PoP strategy provides an alternative to conventional laboratory-scale protocols, which are generally ill-equipped to perform large-scale phenotypic analyses as the cost is prohibitive and procedures are labor intensive. Our improved differentiation methodologies led to successful parallel and clonal differentiation of the pooled foregut progenitors into HLOs. The clonally derived PoP was conducive to en masse screening for quantifying donor-specific intra-hepatocytic lipid levels, an early pathophysiological manifestation of NAFLD. Hence, our pooled iPSC-derived foregut progenitors enabled: (1) The application of identical pathologic insults, (2) live tracking and sorting of organoids utilizing phenotypic readouts, and (3) SNP profilingassociated with the organoid-of-origin encompassing phenotypic information. As a proof-of-principle, our PoP genotype-phenotype association studies informed the impact of key, GWAS identified, NAFLD risk alleles on liver steatosis phenotype ( Anstee et al., 2020 2.

Genome-wide association analysis identifies variants associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that have distinct effects on metabolic traits PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 , e1001324 Crossref Scopus (794) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, we propose that our pooling strategy represents an organoid level “forward cellomics” platform ( Kimura et al., 2018 27. Kimura, M. ∙ Azuma, M. ∙ Zhang, R.R. ... Digitalized Human Organoid for Wireless Phenotyping iScience. 2018; 4 :294-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) to interrogate genotype-driven phenotypic association in human organoid models.
One key advantage of our organoid models is viable human-based systems for evaluating in-depth phenotypic impacts of an identified variant, independent of patient metabolic status. We demonstrated that one of the most pleiotropic variants, GCKR -rs1260326 TT variant ( Sakaue et al., 2021 49. Sakaue, S. ∙ Kanai, M. ∙ Tanigawa, Y. ... A cross-population atlas of genetic associations for 220 human phenotypes Nat. Genet. 2021; 53 :1415-1424 Crossref Scopus (617) PubMed Google Scholar ), in pooled and individually assessed HLOs, was biologically significant under culturing conditions that mimic T2D insulin resistance. In addition to enhanced fatty-acid-induced triglyceride accumulation with correlating inflammatory signatures, we demonstrated that DNL, insulin resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction were distinguishable from HLOs carrying non-risk GCKR variants. This differential functional evidence of metabolic perturbations in HLOs provided insights into the contribution of the GCKR TT variant in NAFLD and is indicative of the vast potential of human organoids for mechanistic studies.
In vivo , the prognostic value of a T2D phenotype for patients carrying GCKR TT variant was highlighted by our discovery that HbA1c measurements, a diagnostic indicator for T2D, uniquely delineated the severity of NAFLD/NASH-associated inflammatory pathologies. Patients with T2D diabetic HbA1c values (>6.4%) were associated with more severe pathologies than those with normal HbA1c values (<5.7%). This differentiation factor was not observed for other genetic risk variants, particularly the well-established PNPLA3 -rs728409 GG risk variant. Our study firmly supports the inclusion of HbA1c measurements, which are often missing in clinical studies of GCKR -rs1260326 cohorts ( Anstee et al., 2020 2. Anstee, Q.M. ∙ Darlay, R. ∙ Cockell, S. ... Genome-wide association study of non-alcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis in a histologically characterised cohort J.

Glucokinase regulatory protein gene polymorphism affects liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease PLoS One. 2014; 9 , e87523 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, a search of the publicly available database of phenome-wide association studies (Japanese patients; https://pheweb.jp ) indicated a strong correlation between GCKR -rs1260326 and HbA1c among liver-related phenotype and other metabolism-related markers. The influence of ethnicity, gender, age, and BMI status on differential HbA1c values in GCKR -rs1260326 cohorts remains to be further determined.
Because T2D complication in NAFLD patients presents with hepatic insulin resistance, the GCKR -rs1260326-dependent subgrouping by HbA1c values may be informative for precision patient management strategies. We noted that the subgroup of patients who had non-diabetic HbA1c values (<5.7%) exhibited improved pathologies upon metformin therapy, while patients with T2D indications (HbA1c >6.4%) and our insulin insensitive HLO models were poorly responsive to metformin. One implication for risk carriers is the possibility that reduction of dietary fat supplementation may alleviate hepatic substrate-dependent lipogenesis, improving insulin resistance and suppressing lipid deposition. Such non-medical treatments, i.e., lifestyle modification and weight loss, which continue to be recommended as alternatives to medication ( The Lancet Gastroenterology, 2020 59. The Lancet Gastroenterology, H. Headway and hurdles in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Lancet Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2020; 5 :93 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) despite high variability in outcomes ( Pollin et al., 2011 42. Pollin, T.I. ∙ Jablonski, K.A. ∙ McAteer, J.B. ... Triglyceride response to an intensive lifestyle intervention is enhanced in carriers of the GCKR Pro446Leu polymorphism J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 96 :E1142-E1147 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Belalcazar et al., 2016 4. Belalcazar, L.M. ∙ Papandonatos, G.D. ∙ Erar, B. ... Lifestyle Intervention for Weight Loss and Cardiometabolic Changes in the Setting of Glucokinase Regulatory Protein Inhibition: Glucokinase Regulatory Protein-Leu446Pro Variant in Look AHEAD Circ. Cardiovasc. Genet. 2016; 9 :71-78 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), could be beneficial when integrated with understanding the genotype-driven physiological condition of the patient. For the GCKR -rs1260326 TT variant, we conclude that its contribution to NAFLD/NASH is highly dependent on the diabetic status informed by HbA1c measurements and, thus, may be of prognostic value for GCKR -rs1260326 TT carriers. Our results also pave the way for designing focused approaches to better address the T2D complication in populations of GCKR- TT carriers by optimally controlling substrate intake and de novo lipogenesis via lifestyle modification and/or drug exposure. Collectively, the integration of in vitro HLO models with in vivo clinical data provided insights to improve the capturing of the highly variable in vivo pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH risk variants.

Wessel, J. ∙ Marrero, D. Do Genes Determine Our Health? Implications for Designing Lifestyle Interventions and Drug Trials Circ. Cardiovasc.

Metabolic control analysis of hepatic glycogen synthesis in vivo Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :8166-8176 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the resultant expressed GCKR p.Pro446Leu protein, with loss of ability to interact and modulate GCK activities, is also recognized to protect against T2D as hepatic glucose utilization is enhanced independent of insulin ( Zain et al., 2015 70. Zain, S.M. ∙ Mohamed, Z. ∙ Mohamed, R. A common variant in the glucokinase regulatory gene rs780094 and risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A meta-analysis J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2015; 30 :21-27 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Xia et al., 2019 66. Xia, M.F. ∙ Bian, H. ∙ Gao, X. NAFLD and Diabetes: Two Sides of the Same Coin? Rationale for Gene-Based Personalized NAFLD Treatment Front. Pharmacol. 2019; 10 :877 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). This “double-edged sword” feature of GCKR actions hampered the initial therapeutic promise of biologics disrupting GCK-GCKR complex interactions, as undesirable side effects of hypoglycemia, increased hepatic steatosis (as we also observed in our HLO model) were observed, and loss of efficacy was presumably related to the development of hepatic insulin resistance ( Hale et al., 2015 16. Hale, C. ∙ Lloyd, D.J. ∙ Pellacani, A. ... Molecular targeting of the GK-GKRP pathway in diabetes Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2015; 19 :129-139 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our transcriptomic and functional analyses revealed that, in addition to modulating GCK activities, the GCKR -rs1260326 TT variant was strongly associated with mitochondrial dysregulation. Evidence from our GCKR TT HLO studies indicated potently enhanced persistent mitochondrial ROS and reduced OCR, which was exacerbated by exposure to fatty acid. Most intriguingly, treating our GCKR TT HLO steatohepatitis-like models with oxidative uncouplers (NR/NTZ), but not metformin, normalized mitochondrial functions and suppressed fatty-acid induced inflammatory responses, suggesting potential therapeutic pathways.
Emerging therapeutic approaches to treat NAFLD and T2D have focused on disrupting metabolic and inflammatory pathways that interconnect the two conditions. Efficacy, however, has remained poor, limited, or controversial, due in part to still-imperfect understanding of these complex interconnections ( Ferguson and Finck, 2021 12. Ferguson, D. ∙ Finck, B.N. Emerging therapeutic approaches for the treatment of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2021; 17 :484-495 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the contributions of genomic SNPs. For carriers of the GCKR -rs1260326 (patients and HLO models), metformin and developing NASH drugs, obeticholic acid and CCR2/5 inhibitor (not shown), demonstrated poor pharmacological benefits in suppressing NASH-associated inflammatory phenotypes. Our findings, that an FDA-approved drug, NTZ, in concert with NR, was capable of suppressing lipid-induced inflammation in GCKR TT -HLO suggest the possibility of effective pharmacological intervention for at least a subset of patients with NAFLD. Because the GCKR -rs1260326 TT variant represents almost 40% of the USA population ( Orho-Melander et al., 2008 38. Orho-Melander, M. ∙ Melander, O. ∙ Guiducci, C. ... Common missense variant in the glucokinase regulatory protein gene is associated with increased plasma triglyceride and C-reactive protein but lower fasting glucose concentrations Diabetes. 2008; 57 :3112-3121 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ), with African ethnicity having the lowest (app. 10%) allelic frequency ( Rich et al., 2018 45. Rich, N.E. ∙ Oji, S. ∙ Mufti, A.R. ... Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Prevalence, Severity, and Outcomes in the United States: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 16 :198-210.e2 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ), our study provides a better understanding of the mechanism in which risk variants contribute to NAFLD and indicate the need to tailor therapeutic intervention depending on both genetic and metabolic status of the patients.
In conclusion, our present study integrating organoid modeling and clinical analyses highlights methodological advances and emphasizes insights for a better understanding of the personalized basis of complex, common diseases such as NAFLD/NASH. Improving patient stratification will enable earlier identification and implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies. With NAFLD affecting nearly one billion people globally, early identification of susceptible individuals with a rigorous interventional design, including lifestyle management and refining treatment options, is critical for precision hepatology.
First, in this study, metabolic dysfunction incurred by a genetic variant was predominantly studied in a static state. Dynamic effects such as those inferred from lipogenic flux studies were not addressed and may shed more light on lipogenic defects in genetically defined organoids. Second, although this is the en masse investigative approach for performing GWAS in-a-dish with organoids to dissect complex genetic contributions, the scale achieved (24 patients) is modest and still requires a significant amount of "hand-to-hand combat," which remains a substantial hurdle for the field of human genetics. Future extensive improvements in throughput for organoid generation and phenotypic callouts will be key to the overall scale of the approach. This can be facilitated by combinatorial use of bioprinter, organoid sorter, and functional genomics technologies. Third, we limited in-depth characterization of hepatocytes in our system, as hepatocytes are responsible for the most upstream cause of NAFLD. Given that our en masse protocols allow for multicellular lineage induction from the same donor, unlike primary-cell-derived epithelial organoid systems, parsing out multicellular pathogenesis and the gene-environment interactions will be of further interest to predicate the utility of the system for subsequent downstream events such as inflammation and fibrosis.

Human iPSC lines used in this study are summarized in Table S1 . Patient cells, where applicable, were obtained with consent in compliance with ethics guidelines (Institutional Review Board, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center) and reprogrammed into iPSC by the CCHMC Pluripotent Stem Cell Facility. All human iPSC lines were maintained as described previously ( Takebe et al., 2017 57. Takebe, T. ∙ Sekine, K. ∙ Kimura, M. ... Massive and Reproducible Production of Liver Buds Entirely from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :2661-2670 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, undifferentiated hiPSCs were cultured on Laminin 511E8-fragment (Nippi, Japan) coated dishes in Stem Fit medium (Ajinomoto Co, Japan) with 100 ng/ml bFGF (R&D Systems, MN, USA) at 37°C in 5% CO 2 with 95% air.
A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 1091 adults diagnosed with NAFLD (STELLAR-3 trial, NCT03053050 ( Younossi et al., 2019 68. Younossi, Z.M. ∙ Stepanova, M. ∙ Younossi, I. ...

Combination Therapies Including Cilofexor and Firsocostat for Bridging Fibrosis and Cirrhosis Attributable to NASH Hepatology. 2021; 73 :625-643 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar )) was performed with demographics, biomarkers, and liver histology available for clinical samples. The STTELLAR-3 trial was phase 3 study of selonsertib enroll 808 patients with bridging fibrosis attributable to NASH. The ATLAS trial was phase 2b study enrolled 395 patients with bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis attributable to NASH. Both trials were an international, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, allocation-concealed. The protocols conformed to ethical guidelines and were approved by the appropriate national and institutional review committees. All patients provided written informed consent.
For en masse organoid phenotyping, the number of donors was determined on a recent Monte Carlo simulation that a cohort of 24 human iPSC lines would yield a 92% probability that can predict an event occurring 1 in 10 patients ( Fermini et al., 2018 13. Fermini, B. ∙ Coyne, S.T. ∙ Coyne, K.P. Clinical Trials in a Dish: A Perspective on the Coming Revolution in Drug Development SLAS Discov. 2018; 23 :765-776 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Retrospective clinical analysis was carried out based on predetermined samples, therefore, no sample size estimation was applied.
Human iPSCs were differentiated into foregut (FG) using previously described methods. In brief, hiPSCs were detached by Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, USA) and were seeded on Laminin coated tissue culture plate with 50,000 cells/cm2. The medium was changed to RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) containing 100 ng/mL Activin A (R&D Systems) and 50 ng/mL bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4; R&D Systems) at day 1, 100 ng/mL Activin A and 0.2% fetal calf serum (FCS; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) at day 2, and 100 ng/mL Activin A and 2% FCS at day 3. For 4–6 days, cells were cultured in Advanced DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) with B27 (Life Technologies) and N2 (Gibco, CA, USA) containing 500 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4; R&D Systems) and 3 μM CHIR99021 (Stemgent, MA, USA). Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 with 95% air and the medium was replaced daily. The FG cells were detached by Accutase and cryopreserved in Cell Banker 1 media (Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan), at −150°C.
The cryopreserved FG cells were thawed quickly and gently centrifuged at 800 rpm for 3 min. Cells were suspended with Matrigel matrix (Corning Inc., NY, USA) on ice, for a final concentration of 750,000 cells/mL. Details of the analysis of the pooled organoid panel are described in Figure 1 A. In brief, the frozen FG cells derived from each iPSC cell line were mixed and resuspended in Matrigel on ice. The mixture of cells and Matrigel was embedded in 50μL drops on dishes in advanced DMEM/F12 with 2% B27, 1% N2, 10 mM HEPES, 1% Glutamax, 1% Pen/Strep, 5 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), 10 ng/mL vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 3 μM CHIR99021, 0.5 μM A83-01, and 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid, and incubated in the CO 2 incubator for 4 days with medium changed every 2 days. The medium was then switched to advanced DMEM/F12 with 2% B27, 1% N2, 10 mM HEPES, 1% Glutamax, 1% Pen/Strep, and 2 μM retinoic acid (RA), and incubated in the CO 2 incubator for further 4 days with medium changed every 2 days. The final media switch was to the hepatocyte culture medium (HCM; Lonza, MD, USA) and the cells were incubated in a CO 2 incubator for 6 days, changing the medium every 2 days.
HLO was isolated from Matrigel and washed with 1xPBS, then cultured with HCM media containing 5 μg/mL insulin and 300 μM sodium oleate (Sigma) on ultra-low attachment 6 multi-well plates (Corning) to induce sHLO. sHLO were collected at day 3 for lipids accumulation and day 3 or 7 for evaluating markers of inflammation. Accumulation of lipid in HLOs was measured using BODIPY 493/503 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Briefly, sHLOs were rinsed three times with warm PBS to remove residual oleic acid from the cell surface. Lipids accumulated in sHLOs and nuclei were stained with 2 μM BODIPY 493/503 and NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific). After staining, sHLOs were scanned using a Nikon A1 inverted confocal microscope (Japan) and Keyence BZ-X710 automated fluorescence microscope (Japan). The lipid droplet volume was calculated by using Analysis Application Hybrid cell count (Keyence) and normalized with each nucleus signal. Hepatosteatosis index was calculated by donor distribution in high- and low-fat accumulator groups, determined by donor-specific SNP-PCR. The hepatosteatosis index of 1 means that the indicated donor is equally distributed between high- and low-groups.
Details of the donor identification of pooled organoid panels are described in Figure S1 F. In brief, donor-specific SNP genotypes are used to detect the ratio of each donor in a multi-donor HLO panel. The gDNA of each donor-derived iPSC was extracted and the SNP profile was obtained by SNP array. Based on the SNP profile, each donor-specific SNP was selected from TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc). Standard curves for each donor were generated using donor gDNA mixed in arbitrary ratios. The gDNA of the multi-donor HLO panel was extracted in batches and the ratio of each donor was determined using the generated standard curve. For screening of lipid accumulation phenotypes in the multi-donor HLO panel, the high and low lipid accumulation phenotype groups were separated under fluorescence microscopy from 24 donor population organoid panel of fatty acid-induced sHLO. The cutoff value of fluorescence intensity was set to 50 using BZ-X710 automated fluorescence microscope and Analysis Application Hybrid cell count (Keyence). The gDNA from the two isolated groups was extracted with DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen), and the distribution of each donor-specific SNP was measured using SNP donor identification method as described.
Single-cell RNA sequencing of the pooled organoid panel was performed as previously described ( Ouchi et al., 2019 39. Ouchi, R. ∙ Togo, S. ∙ Kimura, M. ... Modeling steatohepatitis in humans with pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :374-384.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, a pooled organoid panel consisting of 24 donors at day 27 was dissociated to single cells by Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) in phenol red (GIBCO) for 10 min and washed with 1xPBS. 17,500 cells underwent single cell RNA-seq library preps and were sequenced with the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. Sequenced reads were processed using the Cell Ranger gene expression pipelines mkfastq and count, starting with demultiplexing and conversion of barcode and read data to fastq files. Raw reads were aligned to the Hg19 genome and filtered, creating gene-barcode matrices. Analyses were performed in AltAnalyze, where gene and cell clusters were identified through unsupervised analysis to identify predominant sample groups via expression clustering. Following the removal of outliers, clusters were restricted to having >5 cells, a minimum Pearson correlation of 0.5, and a between-cluster fold change >4. Cell cycle effects were removed. Cluster-based heatmaps and plots were generated using Seurat R package.
To derive GCKR -rs1260326 SNP edited hiPSC, we chose the YD8-1 hiPSC as a parental cell line since this hiPSC line has no NAFLD-associated risk variants in PNPLA3 -rs738409, GCKR -rs1260326, and TM6SF2 -rs58542926. Introduction of GCKR -rs1260326 TT risk variant in YD8-1 hiPSC was performed using the microhomology-assisted excision (MhAX) method ( Kim et al., 2018 26. Kim, S.-I. ∙ Matsumoto, T. ∙ Kagawa, H. ... Microhomology-assisted scarless genome editing in human iPSCs Nat Commun. 2018; 9 :939 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications, summarized in Figure S3 . In brief, donor plasmids for the introduction of each allele were created by PCR amplification of the homology arms from YD8-1 hiPSC genomic DNA using the primers listed in Table S6 . In-Fusion cloning (Clontech) was used to assemble the arms with tdTomato-P2A-PUR selection cassette and pAAVS1-P-CAG-mCh plasmid backbone (Addgene). PCR-amplified regions and In-Fusion junctions were verified by Sanger sequencing. Oligonucleotides encoding sgRNA protospacer sequences targeting GCKR and ps1 (for cassette excision) ( Table S6 ) were annealed and cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (pX458) and pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9 (pX330), respectively (Addgene). sgRNAs were verified by Sanger sequencing. For gene targeting, the donor plasmid (8 μg) and the GCKR -targeting Cas9/sgRNA expression plasmid (pX458-based, 2 μg) were co-transfected by electroporation into 1 × 10 6 cells of YD8-1 hiPSC, followed by plating under feeder-free conditions for 48 h in AK02N medium containing 10 μM Y-27632. Antibiotic selection using 0.5 μg/mL of puromycin was initiated 3 days post electroporation. Ten days after plating, puromycin-resistant cells were pooled and passaged. Single-cell-derived colonies were isolated, cultured, and processed for genomic DNA isolation under feeder-free conditions in 96-well format. The clones positive for PCR genotyping and sequencing were further expanded as populations for subsequent cassette excision. For cassette excision, 5 μg of pX330-based expression plasmid targeting ps1 was transfected into 1 × 10 6 gene-targeted cells followed by growth without selection for 7 days tdTomato-negative cells were isolated by FACS on a BD FACSAria III cell sorter, and plated into a 96-well plate followed by the growth of single-cell-derived clones. Isolated clones were cultured and then genotyped for cassette excision by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The selected, SNP-edited clones were subjected to karyotyping with G-band analysis.
GCK activity of HLOs was measured using the PicoProbe Glucokinase Activity Assay Kit (BioVision inc., CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HLOs were homogenized with 100 μL ice-cold GCK Assay Buffer containing 2.5 mM DTT and kept on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 x g at 4C° for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. Fluorescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy H1 hybrid multi-mode monochromator fluorescence microplate reader (BioTek, VT, USA). The total protein content was also measured, and fluorescence intensity was normalized to total protein.
Metabolomic analyses were conducted at the Northwestern University Metabolomics Core. For acetyl-CoA and palmitate analyses, metabolites were extracted using 10% trichloroacetic and solid phase extraction using Oasis HLB 1cc (30mg) cartridges (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). For acyl-carnitine extraction, 80:20 methanol/water extraction was used. Protein quantity for normalization of mass-spec values was analyzed in pellets produced during metabolite solubilization procedures. The following standards were employed: 16:0(d4) Coenzyme A: palmitoyl(11,11,12,12-d4) Coenzyme A (AvantiLipids), Acetyl-Coenzyme A (sodium salt; Cayman Chemicals), Palmitic Acid-d9 MaxSpec Standard (Cayman Chemicals), NSK-B labeled carnitine standards set B (Cambridge Isotope Labs). Samples were analyzed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry and Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Specifically, the system consisted of a Thermo Q-Exactive in line with an electrospray source and an Ultimate3000 (Thermo) series HPLC consisting of a binary pump, degasser, and auto-sampler outfitted with an Xbridge Amide column (Waters; dimensions of 4.6 × 100 mm and a 3.5 μm particle size). The mobile phase A contained 95% (v/v) water, 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 20 mM ammonium hydroxide, 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH = 9.0; B was 100% Acetonitrile. The gradient was as following: 0 min, 15% A; 2.5 min, 30% A; 7 min, 43% A; 16 min, 62% A; 16.1–18 min, 75% A; 18–25 min, 15% A with a flow rate of 400 μL/min. The capillary of the ESI source was set to 275°C, with sheath gas at 45 arbitrary units, auxiliary gas at 5 arbitrary units, and the spray voltage at 4.0 kV. In positive/negative polarity switching mode, an m / z scan range from 70 to 850 was chosen, and MS1 data was collected at a resolution of 70,000. The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at 1 × 106 and the maximum injection time was 200 ms. The top 5 precursor ions were subsequently fragmented, in a data-dependent manner, using the higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell set to 30% normalized collision energy in MS2 at a resolution power of 17,500. The sample volumes of 25 μL were injected. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out by Xcalibur 4.0 software and Tracefinder 2.1 software, respectively (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific). Metabolite levels were analyzed as peak area normalized to total ion content and to protein quantity. Metabolite analysis was performed blinded to experimental groups.
GCKR CC and GCKR TT HLOs were cultured in HCM media in the presence or absence of 200μM PFK15 and 10μM AMG3969 for 5 days. To assess the impact on lipid accumulation in HLO, BODIPY staining was performed and scanned using a Nikon A1 inverted confocal microscope. The lipid droplet volume was calculated by using Analysis Application Hybrid cell count and normalized with each nucleus signal.
DNA of consenting subjects enrolled in NASH clinical trials ( Harrison et al., 2020 17. Harrison, S.A. ∙ Wong, V.W.S. ∙ Okanoue, T. ... Selonsertib for patients with bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis due to NASH: Results from randomized phase III STELLAR trials J. Hepatol. 2020; 73 :26-39 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ) was submitted for whole genome sequencing (performed by WuXi NextCODE). Genomes were sequenced to an average coverage of 20X using paired 150nt reads. DNA sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) using BWA-MEM software ( Li and Durbin, 2009 30. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32768) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genotypes were called for each sample using a GATK4.0-compatible computational pipeline ( Kendig et al., 2019 24. Kendig, K.I. ∙ Baheti, S. ∙ Bockol, M.A. ... Sentieon DNASeq Variant Calling Workflow Demonstrates Strong Computational Performance and Accuracy Front. Genet. 2019; 10 :736 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tests for associations between genotypes and clinical measures of interest were carried out using R package “finalfit” using default parameters.
The DonorMatched RNASeq Characterization DataSet (Samsara Sciences, #RSDP) was used for the four human hepatocyte transcriptome datasets (n = 3 per donor). Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of HLOs generated from two donors of GCKR TT variant and three donors of GCKR CC variant (n = 2 each per donor) was performed by Novogene (China) on an Illumina Novaseq S4 platform. RNA sequencing parameters were 150bp pair-end sequencing at a depth of 20M reads per sample. Clean data were generated from the raw data that was filtered by data-processing steps, including removal of adapter sequences, reads with more than 10% N, and low-quality sequences (the percentage of low-quality bases of quality value ≤5 is greater than 50% in a read). All the Fastq read files for each sample, for both human hepatocyte and HLOs were then aligned to hg19 version of the human genome using the Computational Suite for Bioinformaticians and Biologists version 3.0 (CSBB-v3.0, https://github.com/praneet1988/Computational-Suite-For-Bioinformaticians-and-Biologists ) to obtain raw transcript counts. The trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalized Log2 Counts-per-Million (CPM) values were obtained and analyzed for differential expression with the interactive Gene Expression Analysis Kit ( Choi and Ratner, 2019 8. Choi, K. ∙ Ratner, N. iGEAK: an interactive gene expression analysis kit for seamless workflow using the R/shiny platform BMC Genom. 2019; 20 :177 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( Subramanian et al., 2005 56. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33611) PubMed Google Scholar ) (GSEA). For differential expression, statistical and biological significance was set at p < 0.05, fold-change > 1.5, Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used for multiple testing, with a minimum of 0.5 CPM in one of the samples. The GCKR variant was determined from the RNA-seq data using the Genome Analysis Toolkit v4.0 haplotype caller (GATK HC) after merging the triplicate data. The variants were filtered using GATK variantfilteration step and were annotated using ANNOVAR ( Wang et al., 2010 62. Wang, K. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Hakonarson, H. ANNOVAR: functional annotation of genetic variants from high-throughput sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :e164 Crossref Scopus (9726) PubMed Google Scholar ). Curated gene sets of Reactome ( https://reactome.org/ ), a general-purpose public database of human pathways, were used for GSEA. The pathways with a significant difference of p < 0.05 were selected for further analysis and ordered by normalized enrichment score (NES).
OCR of HLOs and sHLOs was measured using the Extracellular Oxygen Consumption Assay (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. About 300 organoids were distributed into each well of black flat- and clear-bottomed 96-well microplate (Corning). Fluorescence intensity (380 nm excitation and 650 nm emission) was measured kinetically for 180 min using BioTek Synergy H1 hybrid multi-mode monochromator fluorescence microplate reader with a time-resolved fluorescence mode. The delay time was set as 30 μs and the total time of windows was 100 μs. OCR was calculated from the linear portion of the fluorescence intensity versus time plot, and then normalized to the total HLO number counted by Keyence BZ-X710 automated fluorescence microscope with cell count Analysis Application (Keyence).
To obtain both polar and non-polar fractions of the HLOs for NMR analysis, all sample preparation was completed as previously described ( Watanabe et al., 2016 64. Watanabe, M. ∙ Roth, T.L. ∙ Bauer, S.J. ... Feasibility Study of NMR Based Serum Metabolomic Profiling to Animal Health Monitoring: A Case Study on Iron Storage Disease in Captive Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) PLoS One. 2016; 11 , e0156318 Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar ). Briefly, the appropriate volumes of solvents (final constant ratio of 2:2:1.8 of chloroform: methanol: water) were added to HLO samples. The hydrophilic extract and non-polar fraction were dried in a vacuum centrifuge at room temperature and stored at −80°C until further preparation for NMR data collection. On the day of the data collection, dried polar extracts were re-hydrated with 220 μL of NMR buffer containing 100mM phosphate buffer, pH7.3, 1mM TMSP (3-Trimethylsilyl 2,2,3,3-d4 propionate), 1 mg/mL sodium azide) prepared in D 2 O. The non-polar extracts were suspended with 220uL D-chloroform with 0.3 v/v TSP. The final volume of 200 uL of each sample was transferred into a 103.5 × 3 mm NMR tube (Bruker Biospin, Germany) for data collection. NMR spectra were recorded and processed as previously described ( Matrka et al., 2017 35. Matrka, M.C. ∙ Watanabe, M. ∙ Muraleedharan, R. ... Overexpression of the human DEK oncogene reprograms cellular metabolism and promotes glycolysis PLoS One. 2017; 12 , e0177952 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ) on a Bruker Avance II 600 MHz spectrometer with BBO Prodigy probe. Metabolite assignments and quantification were performed using Chenomx NMR Suite profiling software (Chenomx Inc. version 8.4) based on the internal standard, TMSP. The metabolite abundances were normalized to total protein prior to statistical analysis.
ROS production in HLO and sHLOs and nuclei were stained with 5 μM CellROX Orange Reagent, for oxidative stress detection (ThermoFisher Scientific) and NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagent, respectively. Mitochondrial superoxide was detected using MitoSOX Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (ThermoFisher Scientific). After staining, HLOs and sHLOs were scanned using a Nikon A1 inverted confocal microscope (Japan) and Keyence BZ-X710 automated fluorescence microscope (Japan). The ROS production was calculated by using Analysis Application Hybrid cell count and normalized with each nucleus signal.
NAD/NADH in HLOs and sHLOs were measured using the NAD/NADH Quantitation Kit (Sigma, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HLOs were rinsed with cold PBS and extracted with 500 μL of NADH/NAD Extraction Buffer by homogenization. The sample was mixed vigorously by vortexing for 30 s, and then centrifuged at 13,000 x g at 4°C for 10 min to remove the insoluble fraction. Fluorescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy H1 hybrid multi-mode monochromator fluorescence microplate reader (BioTek, VT, USA). The fluorescence intensity was normalized to the total protein concentration of the respective sample.
sHLOs were cultured in HCM media in the presence or absence of 250 μg/ml MET or 1mM NR and 3μM NTZ. NR and NTZ were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for stock solutions of 1000 and 30 mM, respectively. The final working concentration of DMSO in culture medium was 0.1% DMSO, and controls received 0.1% DMSO as the vehicle. To assess the impact on lipid accumulation in sHLO, BODIPY staining was performed. These HLOs were further assayed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) by imaging and RT-qPCR.
Inflammation cytokines secreted from HLOs and sHLOs were measured using the MSD V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel assay kit (Meso Scale Diagnostics, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To measure secreted IL1b and TNFα, culture supernatants were collected after 72 h of culture. HLO in the analyzed wells was quantified using the CellTiter-Glo 3D Cell Viability Assay (Promega, WI, USA) to normalize secreted cytokine.
Glucose production in HLOs and sHLOs were measured using the Glucose Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision inc., CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HLOs and sHLOs were rinsed three times with cold PBS, suspended in DMEM without glucose, supplemented with 100 μM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), and seeded onto ultra-low attachment 6 multi-well plates (Corning). After 12 h, the culture supernatant was collected and used for glucose production measurement. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a BioTek Synergy H1 hybrid multi-mode monochromator fluorescence microplate reader (BioTek, VT, USA). HLOs in the analyzed wells were quantified using the CellTiter-Glo 3D Cell Viability Assay (Promega) to normalize secreted glucose. To assess insulin responsiveness in HLOs, HLOs and sHLOs were incubated in an AdDMEM medium for 12 h in the presence or absence of 1 μM insulin. The amount of glucose in the collected supernatant was measured.
Triglyceride and cholesterol secretion in HLOs and sHLOs were measured using the Triglyceride Quantification Colorimetric/Fluorometric kit (BioVision) and Cholesterol Quantification Assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HLOs and sHLOs were rinsed with cold PBS and seeded onto ultra-low attachment 6 multi-well plates (Corning) in HCM medium. After 24 h, the culture supernatant was collected for triglyceride and cholesterol measurements. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a BioTek Synergy H1 hybrid multi-mode monochromator fluorescence microplate reader (BioTek, VT, USA). HLOs in the analyzed wells were quantified using the CellTiter-Glo 3D Cell Viability Assay (Promega) to normalize secreted triglyceride and cholesterol.
HLOs and sHLOs were starved with 0.2% FCS/DMEM/F12 for 18 h and then stimulated with insulin (170 ng/mL) for 20 min. Treated HLOs were washed twice with PBS and lysed with M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Protein quantification was measured using the Pierce Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). For WB analysis, 10 μg protein were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-AKT (Clone C67 × 10 7 , Cell signaling technologies, MA, USA), anti-phospho-AKT (Clone C31E5E, Cell signaling technologies), anti-α-tubulin (Clone DM1A, Cell signaling technologies) as indicated.
Mitophagy was evaluated using Mitophagy dye (#MD01, Dojindo Molecular Technology) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, HLOs and sHLOs were rinsed with warm HCM, then treated with 100 nM of Mitophagy dye for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were rinsed twice with warm HCM and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 24 h, cells were washed with warm HCM and stained with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific). After staining, the cells were observed on a Keyence BZ-X800 automated fluorescence microscope (Japan). The mitophagy levels were calculated using Analysis Application Hybrid cell count (Keyence) and normalized to each nucleus signal.
Flow cytometry analysis of HLO was performed as previously described ( Ouchi et al., 2019 39. Ouchi, R. ∙ Togo, S. ∙ Kimura, M. ... Modeling steatohepatitis in humans with pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :374-384.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, HLOs were dissociated to single cells with Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) in phenol red (GIBCO) for 15 min. After PBS wash, cells were stained with primary antibodies (mouse anti-Parkin antibody, rabbit anti-Mitofusin 2 antibody) and corresponding secondary antibodies, and were subjected to flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide staining. All analysis was performed by BD FACSCanto3 (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC).
The copy number of mtDNA was determined by amplifying mitochondrial tRNA-Leu(UUR) and nuclear-encoded β2m (beta-2-microglobulin) genes as previously described ( Rooney et al., 2015 47. Rooney, J.P. ∙ Ryde, I.T. ∙ Sanders, L.H. ... PCR based determination of mitochondrial DNA copy number in multiple species Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1241 :23-38 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total DNAs were extracted from HLOs and sHLOs using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, then quantified with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit by a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Amplification was carried out using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cycling was performed at 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 62°C for 1 min. PCR amplification used the following primers: tRNA-Leu (F: 5′-CACCCAAGAACAGGGTTTGT-3', R: 5′-TGGCCATGGGTATGTTGTTA-3′); β2m (F: 5′-TGCTGTCTCCATGTTTGATGTATCT-3', R: 5′-TCTCTGCTCCCCACCTCTAAGT-3′). The relative level of mtDNA copy number was calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCt method.
Statistical analyses were mainly carried out using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA) using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test, Dunn-Holland-Wolfe test, or Welch’s t test. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. N -value specified in figure legend refers to biologically independent replicates. For comparisons between unpaired 2 groups, when groups were independent and the variances were unequal, a non-parametric Brunner-Munzel test was performed, unless noted otherwise. No intentional randomization nor blinding was applied however, experimenters were not aware of the nature of the samples due to en masse nature of the assays. No exclusion was made when analyzing the data.
