Title: A route to de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice


Abstract: Summary

Cultivated rice varieties are all diploid, and polyploidization of rice has long been desired because of its advantages in genome buffering, vigorousness, and environmental robustness. However, a workable route remains elusive. Here, we describe a practical strategy, namely de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice. By screening allotetraploid wild rice inventory, we identified one genotype of Oryza alta (CCDD), polyploid rice 1 (PPR1), and established two important resources for its de novo domestication: (1) an efficient tissue culture, transformation, and genome editing system and (2) a high-quality genome assembly discriminated into two subgenomes of 12 chromosomes apiece. With these resources, we show that six agronomically important traits could be rapidly improved by editing O. alta homologs of the genes controlling these traits in diploid rice. Our results demonstrate the possibility that de novo domesticated allotetraploid rice can be developed into a new staple cereal to strengthen world food security.

Section: Introduction

To meet the world summit on food security, 50% more food is required by 2050, putting enormous pressure on increasing the yield per unit area ( Bailey-Serres et al., 2019 7.

Meeting the global food demand of the future by engineering crop photosynthesis and yield potential Cell. 2015; 161 :56-66 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). This challenge becomes even greater owing to rapid climate changes, which results in global warming, extreme high and low temperatures, more droughts and floods, new emergence of pests and diseases, and has already become an immense threat to agriculture and food security ( Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994 90. Rosenzweig, C. ∙ Parry, M. Potential impact of climate change on world food supply Nature. 1994; 367 :133-138 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Wheeler and von Braun, 2013 113. Wheeler, T. ∙ von Braun, J. Climate change impacts on global food security Science. 2013; 341 :508-513 Crossref Scopus (1072) PubMed Google Scholar ). Environmental adaptation of major crops will involve a huge cost, and there is a great need to develop new high yield crops that are more resilient to climate variability and disasters ( Nelson et al., 2009 84. Nelson, G.C. ∙ Rosegrant, M.W. ∙ Koo, J. ... Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation Intl. Food Policy Res. Inst., 2009 Google Scholar ). Polyploidy, mostly resulting from whole genome duplications or interspecific hybridizations, is a common mode of evolution in flowering plants, and polyploid plants often have significant advantages in terms of biomass, vigorousness, and robust adaptation to environmental changes ( Comai, 2005 20.

Rev. Genet. 2017; 18 :411-424 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, crop polyploidization may play an important role in next-generation crop improvement aimed at facing food security challenges.
The domestication of cultivated rice from its ancestral progenitor wild diploid rice Oryza rufipogon is considered one of the most important developments in human history, and rice is now the staple food feeding more than half of the world’s population ( Huang et al., 2012 43. Huang, X. ∙ Kurata, N. ∙ Wei, X. ... A map of rice genome variation reveals the origin of cultivated rice Nature. 2012; 490 :497-501 Crossref Scopus (807) PubMed Google Scholar ). During domestication, various important agronomical traits were selected, including seed shattering, erect plant architecture, panicle shape, awn length, grain size and quality, hull color, and so on ( Chen et al., 2019 18. Chen, E. ∙ Huang, X. ∙ Tian, Z. ... The genomics of Oryza species provides insights into rice domestication and heterosis Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2019; 70 :639-665 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the genomic era, diploid rice has become a model monocot species owing to its relatively simple genome and the development of efficient transformation systems ( Izawa and Shimamoto, 1996 46. Izawa, T. ∙ Shimamoto, K. Becoming a model plant: The importance of rice to plant science Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1 :95-99 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ). Agronomically important genes controlling plant height, tiller number, panicle morphology, seed weight, etc. are well-studied and have been utilized to breed new elite varieties by rational design ( Qian et al., 2016 89.

Rational design of high-yield and superior-quality rice Nat. Plants. 2017; 3 :17031 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even so, new strategies for rice improvement are badly needed. Polyploidization of cultivated diploid rice species has also been proposed, but this presents difficulties mainly because of their restricted genetic backgrounds ( Cai et al., 2007 14.

To date, 27 species of the genus Oryza have been identified and classified into 11 distinct genome types, comprising six diploids (AA, BB, CC, EE, FF, and GG) and five allotetraploids (BBCC, CCDD, HHJJ, HHKK, and KKLL) ( Wing et al., 2018 114. Wing, R.A. ∙ Purugganan, M.D. ∙ Zhang, Q. The rice genome revolution: from an ancient grain to Green Super Rice Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19 :505-517 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of these, the species with CCDD genome from South America have much larger biomass and stronger biotic and abiotic resistance than the cultivated diploid rice ( Ammiraju et al., 2010a 3. Ammiraju, J.S. ∙ Fan, C. ∙ Yu, Y. ...

Newly identified wild rice accessions conferring high salt tolerance might use a tissue tolerance mechanism in leaf Front. Plant Sci. 2018; 9 :417 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Allotetraploid rice with the CCDD genome originated from a single hybridization event, with the CC genome species ( O. officinalis or O. rhizomatis ) serving as the maternal parent and an extinct species with the DD genome type serving as the paternal donor ( O. australiensis with the EE genome type is the extant closest relative of DD) ( Ammiraju et al., 2010b 4.

The rice genome revolution: from an ancient grain to Green Super Rice Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19 :505-517 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). Research on allotetraploid rice has largely lagged behind the well-studied diploid rice species with AA genome because of the lack of a reference genome ( Stein et al., 2018 98. Stein, J.C. ∙ Yu, Y. ∙ Copetti, D. ... Genomes of 13 domesticated and wild rice relatives highlight genetic conservation, turnover and innovation across the genus Oryza Nat.

Domestication of wild plants is believed to have enormous potential for agriculture. The traditional domestication of wild plants into commercially available crops has usually taken hundreds or even thousands of years, but recently developed genome editing technologies make it possible to achieve this in a few generations ( DeHaan et al., 2020 23.

Agrobacterium -mediated transformation systems have been developed efficiently only in O. sativa subspecies japonica and indica ( Hiei et al., 1994 40. Hiei, Y. ∙ Ohta, S. ∙ Komari, T. ...

Shimamoto, K. ∙ Terada, R. ∙ Izawa, T. ... Fertile transgenic rice plants regenerated from transformed protoplasts Nature. 1989; 338 :274-276 Crossref Google Scholar ); however, the transformation efficiency is still very low in O. glaberrima and in wild rice with AA genome ( Lacchini et al., 2020 57.

Mohammed, S. ∙ Samad, A.A. ∙ Rahmat, Z. Agrobacterium -mediated transformation of rice: constraints and possible solutions Rice Science. 2019; 26 :133-146 Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar ). As for allotetraploid wild rice, their transformation remains a formidable challenge, although some of them could be regenerated at an extremely low rate ( Zhang et al., 2019 130.

Here, we describe a route for de novo domestication and improvement of a wild rice relative—the allotetraploid O. alta (CCDD)—by screening the wild allotetraploid rice inventory, establishing an efficient transformation and genome editing system, generating a high-quality annotated assembly of 24 chromosomes that illuminates the hereditary blueprint and evolutionary history of allotetraploid rice genomes, and genome-editing of domestication-related genes and agronomically important genes based on the knowledge of diploid rice. Our work offers a practical strategy for creating new crops to meet future food demand.

Section: Results

To generate polyploid rice crops, we initiated a roadmap strategy, namely a de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice ( Figure 1 A). The whole process can be divided into four steps: step 1, selection of an appropriate starting material for de novo domestication; step 2, establishment of desirable technical systems including a reference genome, the functional annotation of genes and, importantly, an efficient transformation and genome editing system; step 3, design and rapid introduction by multiplex genome editing of domestication-related genes or alleles, followed by field evaluation; and step 4, certification and popularization of the new crop. However, neither a suitable starting material nor the required technical systems were initially available for wild allotetraploid rice.
To identify the most promising starting material, we considered that callus induction and regeneration abilities were essential attributes, followed by suitable biomass characteristics and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Therefore, we collected seeds for 28 lines with CCDD genome from germplasm banks, comprising eight O. alta , two O. grandiglumis , and 18 O. latifolia lines, and tested their abilities of callus induction and regeneration using the typical methods for diploid rice ( Zhang et al., 2016 128. Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Gao, C. Generation of stable transgenic rice ( Oryza sativa L.) by agrobacterium -mediated transformation Curr. Protoc. Plant Biol. 2016; 1 :235-246 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that some of the lines had modest callus induction ability but most gave a very low rate of regeneration, except for one genotype of O. alta (accession ID 2007-24 from National Nursery of Wild Rice Germplasm, Nanning, China), which performed well for both callus induction and regeneration ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ). Focusing on this line, we optimized the protocols and finally achieved a satisfactory transformation system with ∼80% transformation efficiency and ∼40% regeneration ability ( Figures S1 B–S1E). We therefore considered this material a model for further research into de novo domestication and named it polyploid rice 1 (PPR1). Importantly, PPR1 also had a low rate of heterozygosity (<0.2%) ( Figure S2 A), which is a positive feature for genome sequencing and assembly. Although it has a substantially larger biomass than cultivated rice, it has typical non-domesticated features, such as height >2.7 m ( Figure 1 B), broad and long leaves ( Figure 1 C), panicle >48 cm in length with sparse spikelets ( Figure 1 D), and small grain size (thousand-grain weight ∼8.79 g) with awns >4 cm ( Figure 1 E). In summary, we selected PPR1 as the starting model material for de novo domestication and established an efficient tissue culture and transformation system of it, thus overcoming one of the biggest hurdles in the process of de novo domestication.
The second challenge was to assemble a high-quality genome of PPR1. We took an integrated genome sequencing and assembling approach by generating 121.1 Gb (∼123.42X) of single-molecule real-time sequencing data, 287.1 Gb (∼292.62X) of BioNano data, 103.2 Gb (∼105.18X) of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data, and 85.2 Gb (∼86.79X) Illumina short reads ( Figures S2 B and S2C), and achieved a high-quality assembly comprising 24 pseudo-chromosomes with contig N50 of 18.2 Mb, superscaffold N50 of 37.1 Mb (PPR1 V1.0) ( Table 1 ), and a total genome size of 894.6 Mb (876.4 Mb anchored on chromosomes). We then constructed a gene expression atlas by generating 235 Gb of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for ten representative tissues, which yielded an average 92.81% mapping rate to PPR1 V1.0 ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Of the 482,997 transcripts derived from transcriptome sequencing, 90.16% were detected in PPR1 V1.0 with more than 99% identity ( Figure S3 C). Finally, 99,312 protein-coding genes, including 81,421 high-confidence (HC) and 17,891 low-confidence genes with an average length of 3,021 bp, were predicted and functionally annotated ( Figures S3 D and S3E). In addition, we annotated 1,253 pseudogenes and 17,104 non-coding RNAs, including 12,332 microRNAs, 2,032 rRNAs, 1,147 tRNAs, 207 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), 1,057 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 10 signal recognition particle RNAs (srpRNAs), and 319 other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) ( Table S2 ). Of the predicted protein-coding genes, 99.94% were unevenly distributed over the 24 chromosomes with more genes on chromosome arms/ends ( Figure 1 F). We found 98.2% complete genes of the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) gene set ( Seppey et al., 2019 92. Seppey, M. ∙ Manni, M. ∙ Zdobnov, E.M. BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :227-245 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ) were recalled, demonstrating the high accuracy and completeness of the genome assembly.
By aligning 229,886 BAC end sequences and 278 genes from CC and EE genome species ( Table S3 ) ( Ammiraju et al., 2006 2. Ammiraju, J.S. ∙ Luo, M. ∙ Goicoechea, J.L. ... The Oryza bacterial artificial chromosome library resource: construction and analysis of 12 deep-coverage large-insert BAC libraries that represent the 10 genome types of the genus Oryza Genome Res. 2006; 16 :140-147 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zou et al., 2013 137. Zou, X.H. ∙ Yang, Z. ∙ Doyle, J.J. ... Multilocus estimation of divergence times and ancestral effective population sizes of Oryza species and implications for the rapid diversification of the genus New Phytol. 2013; 198 :1155-1164 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the PPR1 genome, we divided the 24 pseudo-chromosomes into C t and D t subgenomes, which contained 52,861 and 46,388 protein-coding genes, respectively ( Table 1 ). Among them, we identified 19,958 homeologous gene pairs, and the transcriptome analysis indicated that 5,732 homeologous gene pairs on the homologous chromosomes showed expression dominance in one gene. Although genome sizes differed noticeably between CC (∼651 Mb) and EE (∼965 Mb) species ( Zuccolo et al., 2007 139. Zuccolo, A. ∙ Sebastian, A. ∙ Talag, J. ... Transposable element distribution, abundance and role in genome size variation in the genus Oryza BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7 :152 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), the C t and D t subgenomes of O. alta had similar sizes of ∼441.3 Mb and ∼435.1 Mb ( Table 1 ), which were also highly collinear with 100 syntenic blocks containing 17,639 and 17,527 genes, respectively, on the homologous chromosomes of the C t and D t subgenomes ( Figure 1 F; Table S4 ). These findings further demonstrate the high quality and coverage of the allotetraploid PPR1 genome sequence.
To explore gene similarity between O. alta and O. sativa , we compared the PPR1 HC genes (81,839 genes) and the Nipponbare MSU gene set (55,986 genes) and found that 43,599 (77.87%) genes of Nipponbare had homologs in O. alta , including 39,543 (70.41%) genes with homologous genes on both C t and D t subgenomes ( Figure 2 A). Meanwhile, we found that 10,862 and 9,982 genes on the C t and D t subgenomes of O. alta found no homologs in cultivated diploid rice, possibly because the highly diverged homologs could not be reliably identified. As O. alta showed strong biotic and abiotic resistance phenotypes ( Khush, 1997 49. Khush, G.S. Origin, dispersal, cultivation and variation of rice Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35 :25-34 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Prusty et al., 2018 88. Prusty, M.R. ∙ Kim, S.R. ∙ Vinarao, R. ... Newly identified wild rice accessions conferring high salt tolerance might use a tissue tolerance mechanism in leaf Front. Plant Sci. 2018; 9 :417 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), we further examined the resistance gene analogs in O. alta ( Table S5 ). Although O. sativa ssp. japonica/Geng Nipponbare, and indica/Xian R498 contain much more nucleotide-binding site (NBS) type genes compared to the C t or D t subgenome ( Figure 2 B) due to the expansion of NBS-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes in the AA genome after the split of O. meridionalis and O. glumaepatula ( Stein et al., 2018 98. Stein, J.C. ∙ Yu, Y. ∙ Copetti, D. ... Genomes of 13 domesticated and wild rice relatives highlight genetic conservation, turnover and innovation across the genus Oryza Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :285-296 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), O. alta contains more genes in total for all four types of resistance gene analogs, showing a potential for broader resistant spectrum. Moreover, the number of transcription factors and transcription regulators is similar among the C t and D t subgenomes and AA genome ( Figures S4 A–S4C; Table S5 ). These results indicate that the O. alta genome contains considerable genetic resources which have not been utilized in cultivated rice.
Furthermore, based on protein homologies among O. alta and nine other species, a total of 42,642 gene families were identified, with 19,925 and 18,519 in the C t and D t subgenomes, respectively ( Figure 2 C). Of these families, 14,125 were shared among C t , D t , and O. sativa and 525 C t -specific and 363 D t -specific. Phylogenetic analysis based on single-copy gene families showed that the O. alta C t subgenome and O. sativa genome were the nearest neighbors, confirming the previous hypothesis that the AA genome shared a more recent common ancestor with the CC genome than with the DD/EE genome ( Wing et al., 2018 114. Wing, R.A. ∙ Purugganan, M.D. ∙ Zhang, Q. The rice genome revolution: from an ancient grain to Green Super Rice Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19 :505-517 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). The estimated divergence times between the AA and CC genomes, and between the CC and DD genomes, were 4.57 and 5.45 million years ago (MYA), respectively ( Wing et al., 2018 114. Wing, R.A. ∙ Purugganan, M.D. ∙ Zhang, Q. The rice genome revolution: from an ancient grain to Green Super Rice Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19 :505-517 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both the C t and D t subgenomes of allotetraploid O. alta were considerably larger than those of Nipponbare and R498. The analysis showed that 61.7% (551.5 Mb) of the O. alta genome consisted of repetitive sequences ( Table 1 ), a much higher proportion than the 40.43% in Nipponbare and 42.05% in R498 ( Du et al., 2017 25. Du, H. ∙ Yu, Y. ∙ Ma, Y. ... Sequencing and de novo assembly of a near complete indica rice genome Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15324 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; International Rice Genome Sequencing Project, 2005 45. International Rice Genome Sequencing Project The map-based sequence of the rice genome Nature. 2005; 436 :793-800 Crossref Scopus (2685) PubMed Google Scholar ). The major difference was in long terminal repeats (LTRs), which are the predominant repeats accounting for 24.1% (215.93 Mb) of the O. alta genome, markedly higher than the 17.55% in Nipponbare and 20.55% in R498 ( Figure 2 D). Gypsy -type LTRs were the most abundant transposable element subfamilies, covering 19.9% (177.60 Mb) of the O. alta genome ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). However, Gypsy and Copia -type LTRs were estimated to have a similar insertion burst time less than one MYA ( Figure 2 E). Repeats and Gypsy -type LTRs covered 62.6% and 21.6% of the D t subgenome, respectively, higher than 59.2% and 18.7% of the C t subgenome ( Figure 2 D). PIF-Harbinger transposons were enriched within the 2-kb upstream and downstream of coding regions ( Figure S2 D), indicating their possible roles in the evolution of cis-elements. These results suggest that the amplification of Gypsy -type LTRs is the major driving force for the expansion of the O. alta genome.
We resequenced a total of 44 wild rice accessions, including 28 CCDD, six EE and ten CC accessions, generating a total of 922.45 Gb of sequence data ( Table S1 ) for population genomic analysis. Sequence reads for each accession were aligned to the PPR1 V1.0 with an average mapping rate of 98.47%, 88.20% and 57.17% for CCDD, CC and EE species, respectively ( Table S1 ). We identified 30.77 million high-quality variants consisting of 21,281,771 SNPs and 9,490,896 indels with an average of 23.8 SNPs and 10.6 indels per kilobase. A total of 7,373,962 SNPs and 3,075,405 indels were located in genic regions, including 1,183,604 nonsynonymous and 288,439 frameshift variants. 70,779 variants had potentially large effects, including 54,340 SNPs and 16,439 indels that cause the introduction of start codons, premature stop codons, and longer-than-usual transcripts. These data indicate that substantial variations exist within the population of CCDD accessions, as well as between C t and C, and between D t and E genomes.
Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the 44 rice accessions were clearly clustered into three groups ( Figure 3 A), namely group 1 from the EE accessions, group 2 from the CCDD accessions, and group 3 from the CC accessions ( Figure 3 B). Neighbor-joining tree and model-based clustering analysis further divided group 2 into two clusters ( Figures 3 C and 3D), with all eight O. alta , two O. grandiglumis , and four O. latifolia accessions in cluster 1 and the other 13 O. latifolia accessions residing in cluster 2. Nucleotide diversity (π) in CCDD accessions was estimated to be 0.0049, which is lower than other polyploidy crops such as potato (0.0111) ( Hardigan et al., 2017 39. Hardigan, M.A. ∙ Laimbeer, F.P.E. ∙ Newton, L. ... Genome diversity of tuber-bearing Solanum uncovers complex evolutionary history and targets of domestication in the cultivated potato Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E9999-E10008 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), but higher than in diploid rice (0.0024 in O. sativa and 0.0030 in O. rufipogon ) ( Huang et al., 2010 42. Huang, X. ∙ Wei, X. ∙ Sang, T. ... Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces Nat. Genet. 2010; 42 :961-967 Crossref Scopus (1196) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that this population of allotetraploid rice can provide diverse genetic resources for future functional genomic study and breeding.
By aligning the resequencing data of the diploid CC and EE Oryza species to the PPR1 genome, we were able to identify which parts of the current O. alta genome are derived from the ancestral CC or DD genomes. This revealed several translocations of large segments between the two subgenomes after tetraploidization ( Figure 3 E; Table S4 ). Chromosomes C t 2 and D t 2 were highly syntenic, but the aligning pattern of the reads from CC and EE genomes to PPR1 clearly showed the occurrence of a large homeologous exchange between them ( Figure 3 F). The continuous interaction signals on the Hi-C heatmap and the consistency with BioNano maps in these regions indicated that this was not due to assembly errors ( Figures 3 G and 3H).
In addition to the homeologous exchange, we found three segments on C t 7 matching to EE genome reads were collinear with C t 4, suggesting that these segments were translocated from the originally ancestral chromosome D t 4 ( Figures 3 E and S5 A). Again the correctness of the assembly was confirmed by Hi-C heatmap and BioNano data ( Figures S5 B and S5C). Similarly, we found several other segments, including one on D t 4, one on D t 3, and one on C t 1, were translocated from the ancestral chromosomes C t 7, C t 6, and D t 3, respectively. Additionally, we also identified 26 syntenic blocks located on non-homeologous chromosomes, apparently caused by ten intra-subgenome translocations, four intra-chromosomal duplications, and 12 inter-chromosomal duplications, respectively ( Figure 3 E; Table S4 ). C t 11, C t 12, and D t 11, D t 12 likely experienced multiple duplications and translocations ( Figure 3 E), but the other six chromosomes have experienced fewer chromosomal rearrangements. According to the matching reads of CC and EE species on each gene, we further identified all the genes originating from ancestral CC genome (ancestral CC genes) and ancestral DD genes in the PPR1 genome, and we found that 5,672 genes (13.04%) that were now in the C t subgenome were of DD origin, while 5,132 genes (13.54%) on the D t subgenome were CC ancestral. Meanwhile, we found that a large number of genes had been lost since tetraploidization; 5,516 ancestral CC genes had no ancestral DD homeologs in the current O. alta genome, and 3,954 ancestral DD genes had no ancestral CC homeologs. All these data suggest the highly dynamic evolution of the O. alta genome.
During the domestication of Asian cultivated rice, traits beneficial for the farming rather than for natural growth, such as erect growth habit, hull color, shattering, awn, pericarp color, and grain size, were selected and improved, and their genetic mechanisms have been extensively studied ( Chen et al., 2019 18. Chen, E. ∙ Huang, X. ∙ Tian, Z. ... The genomics of Oryza species provides insights into rice domestication and heterosis Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2019; 70 :639-665 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Wild rice O. alta shares some traits similar to those of the wild ancestors of the modern cultivars. To rapidly domesticate these traits, we first identified the O. alta homologs of the domestication-related genes in diploid rice ( Figure 4 A), and found that seven of ten important domestication-related genes ( Chen et al., 2019 18. Chen, E. ∙ Huang, X. ∙ Tian, Z. ... The genomics of Oryza species provides insights into rice domestication and heterosis Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2019; 70 :639-665 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), including homologs of qSH1 for shattering, An-1 and An-2 for awn length, Bh4 for hull color, Rc for pericarp color, OsLG1 for panicle shape, and GW5 for grain width, were present in the O. alta genome with >84% identity covering at least 87.5% of O. sativa proteins. PROG1 , a key gene for the erect growth of cultivated rice appeared to have only low level homologs in the subgenomes of O. alta , possibly because O. alta already has an erect growth habit. These domestication-related genes have been exposed to a variety of evolutionary processes. Sh4 experienced inter-subgenome translocation from the D t to the C t subgenome, leading to the shortening of its coding regions. Both of the homologs of GAD1/RAE2 and OsLG1 are present in the C t subgenome, owing to the translocation of a segment from the D t subgenome to the C t subgenome.
As a proof-of-concept to show that modification of these homologs could truly achieve rapid domestication of wild O. alta , we used a CRISPR/Cas9-mutagenesis approach to edit the qSH1 homologs for shattering and An-1 homologs for awn length ( Konishi et al., 2006 52. Konishi, S. ∙ Izawa, T. ∙ Lin, S.Y. ... An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication Science. 2006; 312 :1392-1396 Crossref Scopus (562) PubMed Google Scholar ; Luo et al., 2013 72. Luo, J. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Zhou, T. ... An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice Plant Cell. 2013; 25 :3360-3376 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first designed a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the first exon of both OaqSH1-CC (OalC01g168290) and OaqSH1-DD (OalD01g114050) and identified one mutant, qsh1 CR -1 , which harbored biallelic frameshift mutations for OaqSH1-CC and heterozygous frameshift mutations for OaqSH1-DD ( Figure 4 B; Table S6 ). We found that wild-type PPR1 had a complete layer of abscission cells between the rice grain and the pedicel, forming a longitudinal continuous line similar to wild diploid rice, whereas in qsh1 CR -1 , the line of abscission cells was absent, indicating that the editing of the qSH1 homologs in O. alta can prevent seed shattering ( Figure 4 C). We further designed one sgRNA that targets the first exons of both OaAn-1-CC (OalC04g136090) and OaAn-1-DD (OalD04g130280) and another sgRNA that targets the first exon of OaAn-1-DD , and obtained two mutants of an-1 CR -1 and an-1 CR -2 harboring different homozygous frameshift mutations in both OaAn1-CC and OaAn1-DD ( Figure 4 D; Table S6 ). We found that the average awn length of an-1 CR -1 (1.61 cm) and an-1 CR -2 (2.63 cm) were both significantly shorter than that of PPR1 (4.11 cm) ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Taken together, these results provide a solid basis for the rapid domestication of O. alta .
In addition to the domestication-related genes, we also identified O. alta homologs of 113 agronomically important genes in modern diploid rice cultivars, which determine important traits such as grain yield, grain quality, fertility, heading date, biotic and abiotic resistance, and nutrient-use efficiency ( Figure 5 A; Table S7 ). We found that the genes affecting different features had different similarity levels. The genes affecting sterility in O. sativa were poorly conserved in O. alta , because the best-matched homologs of qHMS7 , S5 , SaF , Sc-j , and S1TPR had similarities less than 40%, and there were no detectable homologs of SaM , WA352 , and pms3 ( Figure 5 A; Table S7 ). The genes associated with biotic stress were also relatively poorly conserved, possibly because diseases and pests are different in Asia and America. In contrast, all genes associated with abiotic stress were highly conserved except for COLD1 ( Ma et al., 2015b 75. Ma, Y. ∙ Dai, X. ∙ Xu, Y. ... COLD1 confers chilling tolerance in rice Cell. 2015; 160 :1209-1221 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CAL1 ( Luo et al., 2018 73. Luo, J.S. ∙ Huang, J. ∙ Zeng, D.L. ... A defensin-like protein drives cadmium efflux and allocation in rice Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :645 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), which are responsible for cold resistance and cadmium accumulation, respectively. Fortunately, we found that most of the genes related to yield, grain quality, and efficient use of nutrients were fairly conserved between the cultivated diploid and the tetraploid wild rice. Based on these findings, we further tested whether these homologs of modern breeding genes could be altered to improve wild allotetraploid rice.
The “Green Revolution” gene sd1 is one of the most important genes in modern rice breeding, because its mutation resulted in a shortened culm with improved lodging resistance and a greater harvest index ( Sasaki et al., 2002 91. Sasaki, A. ∙ Ashikari, M. ∙ Ueguchi-Tanaka, M. ... Green revolution: a mutant gibberellin-synthesis gene in rice Nature. 2002; 416 :701-702 Crossref Scopus (723) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore designed two sgRNAs targeting the first exons of both OaSD1-CC (OalC01g172060) and OaSD1-DD (OalD01g109880), and obtained an sd1 CR -1 mutant that harbored biallelic frameshift mutations in both OaSD1-CC and OaSD1-DD ( Figure 5 B; Table S6 ). We found that its height was dramatically reduced compared with the wild-type PPR1 ( Figure 5 C). In contrast to O. sativa , which usually has 4–5 elongated internodes, O. alta has 10–12 elongated internodes. We carried out a detailed comparison of the lengths of the first eight internodes from the base of the stem and found that the length of the first and fifth internodes was relatively unchanged in sd1 CR -1 , whereas all six other internodes were significantly shortened ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Similar results were obtained in the other five independently edited lines ( Figures S6 A, S6C, and S6D; Table S6 ). Furthermore, we also designed an sgRNA targeting the homologs of GS3 , a key gene controlling seed morphology in diploid rice ( Mao et al., 2010 77. Mao, H. ∙ Sun, S. ∙ Yao, J. ... Linking differential domain functions of the GS3 protein to natural variation of grain size in rice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :19579-19584 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ) and obtained six independent mutants, in which the grain lengths were significantly increased compared with PPR1 ( Figures 5 F, 5G, S6 B, S6E, and S6F; Table S6 ). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the knowledge gained in diploid rice can provide valuable information and directly facilitate the improvement of wild allotetraploid rice.
Ideal Plant Architecture 1 ( IPA1 ) is considered as one of the new green revolution genes, because a point mutation in the gene perturbs OsmiR156 target sites to regulate its expression level, leading to an increased stem diameter, improved lodging resistance, large panicles, and dramatically enhanced grain yield ( Jiao et al., 2010 47. Jiao, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Xue, D. ... Regulation of OsSPL14 by OsmiR156 defines ideal plant architecture in rice Nat. Genet. 2010; 42 :541-544 Crossref Scopus (711) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miura et al., 2010 81. Miura, K. ∙ Ikeda, M. ∙ Matsubara, A. ... OsSPL14 promotes panicle branching and higher grain productivity in rice Nat. Genet. 2010; 42 :545-549 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the sequence of OamiR156-DD was identical to OsmiR156, which matches its target site on OaIPA1-DD (OalD08g132520), whereas OamiR156-CC had a single base change and matches OaIPA1-CC (OalC08g106170) ( Figures 6 A and 6B). We therefore tested whether a base editor optimized for diploid rice could generate gain-of-function base substitution mutations in O. alta ( Zong et al., 2018 135. Zong, Y. ∙ Song, Q. ∙ Li, C. ... Efficient C-to-T base editing in plants using a fusion of nCas9 and human APOBEC3A Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :950-953 Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar ) and designed an sgRNA targeting the miRNA target sites in both OaIPA1-CC and OaIPA1-DD . We obtained a mutant, ipa1 CR -1 , which contains one point mutation in OaIPA1-DD without affecting OaIPA1-CC ( Figure 6 B; Table S6 ). In-detail examination of this mutant revealed that the stem diameter of ipa1 CR -1 was significantly greater than that of PPR1 ( Figures 6 C–6E). We further examined the transcriptional changes of OaIPA1-CC and OaIPA1-DD and found that the expression levels of OaIPA1-DD were 10-fold greater in the shoot bases of ipa1 CR -1 , whereas OaIPA1-CC expression was unchanged ( Figure 6 F). Therefore, the use of base substitution editors can expand the strategies for gene improvement in O. alta .
Rice heading dates, unlike other traits that usually have changes in one direction, become more variable during breeding for expanded habitats, different cropping systems, and different day lengths. In diploid rice, varieties with weak alleles of Ghd7 can be grown for grain production in temperate zones ( Weng et al., 2014 112. Weng, X. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, J. ... Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 is a central regulator of growth, development, and stress response Plant Physiol. 2014; 164 :735-747 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xue et al., 2008 119. Xue, W. ∙ Xing, Y. ∙ Weng, X. ... Natural variation in Ghd7 is an important regulator of heading date and yield potential in rice Nat. Genet. 2008; 40 :761-767 Crossref Scopus (896) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the varieties with low DTH7 activities are less sensitive to increased day length to flower earlier in high geographical regions ( Gao et al., 2014 33. Gao, H. ∙ Jin, M. ∙ Zheng, X.M. ... Days to heading 7 , a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :16337-16342 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2013 120. Yan, W. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Zhou, X. ... Natural variation in Ghd7.1 plays an important role in grain yield and adaptation in rice Cell Res. 2013; 23 :969-971 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). PPR1 originates from tropical regions of South America, displays strong long-day sensitivity, and fails to flower in Beijing (40°N). We used a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 editing approach with three sgRNAs in one vector to edit OaGhd7-CC (OalC07g145340), OaGhd7-DD (OalD07g113810), OaDTH7-CC (OalD04g100060, a CC ancestral gene locating on chromosome D t 4), and OaDTH7-DD (OalD07g145130), and generated eight T 0 independently transformed PPR1 lines. We found that the eight lines all contained different mutant alleles ( Figure 6 G; Table S6 ), and all four genes had been edited in six of the lines, indicating that this technique is highly effective in creating variants in PPR1. In consistence with their genotypes, heading dates varied extensively in these edited lines. Line 1 with all four genes mutated had a dramatically shortened heading date of 82 days after transplantation in Beijing, whereas wild-type PPR1 failed to flower after 150 days. Line 2 and line 3 headed 10 days later after line 1, and lines 4 to 8 gradually headed after 103 to 130 days. The seeds of lines 1 to 7 could be filled, while line 8 seeds failed, suggesting that lines 1 to 3 could even be planted in far northern regions. More importantly, we also developed a multiplex editing system that can target eight or sixteen genes each with a single vector with fairly high efficiency ( Figures 6 H and S7 ; Table S6 ). Taken together, these results showed that it is rational in theory and technology to achieve rapid de novo domestication and improvement of wild allotetraploid rice into a staple food crop in near future.

Section: Discussion

Polyploidization, one of the most important evolutionary events in plants, can increase genetic diversity, introduce new genetic combinations, foster adaptation to new environments, and create vigorousness effects. A great number of economically important crops are alloploids; these include food crops like wheat and oat, industrial crops like tobacco, cotton, and sugarcane, and fruit crops like strawberry, but most of them are natural allopolyploid species. Although the advantages of allopolyploidy are widely recognized, artificially induced alloploid crops are very few and usually result from a long-term breeding program to screen out frequently encountered undesirable features (e.g., triticale, an alloploid crop derived from a cross between wheat and rye). Instead of inducing alloploidy in the modern crops, we aimed at de novo domestication of a wild alloploid plant using genome editing. Starting from the selected genotype PPR1 of the wild allotetraploid rice O. alta , we established an efficient tissue culture and genome editing system, and generated a high-quality genome assembly. By taking advantage of the well-studied domestication-related genes in cultivated diploid rice, we identified their homologs in the O. alta genome, providing essential information for editing its potentially important agronomic genes. We then applied the CRISPR/Cas9, base editing, and multiplex editing technologies to improve PPR1 by editing a series of domestication-related and/or agronomically important genes in diploid rice, in which we obtained edited lines with desired characteristics including seed shattering, awn length, plant height, grain size, stem thickness, and heading date. The present work provides an effective solution to the technical difficulties in achieving rapid de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice. We present the use of wild germplasm, complete reference genomes, improved transformation protocol, and diverse genome editing tools to enable the creation of new crop species.
Hereafter, enormous efforts and investments are still needed to achieve the ultimate success in creating a new crop cultivar deployed in farmers’ field. First, although the barrier of transformation and genome editing has been overcome in wild allotetraploid rice, many alleles require weak effects rather than complete knockouts to generate the most desirable traits. Toward this, high efficient genome editing tools in generating various kinds of modification are still urgently needed. Second, the genes implicated usually have pleotropic effects, and the outcome of different combination of edited alleles is difficult to predict. Therefore, there need more genetic diversities to enable a breeding program that optimizes the engineered alleles. Third, wild rice has many advantages over cultivated rice for traits such as biotic and abiotic stress resistance, which are key factors toward combating the impending climate change challenges ( Chen et al., 2019 18.

Thus, there is huge interest in both characterizing these traits in wild rice ( Huang et al., 2008 41. Huang, C.L. ∙ Hwang, S.Y. ∙ Chiang, Y.C. ...

Atwell, B.J. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Scafaro, A.P. Could abiotic stress tolerance in wild relatives of rice be used to improve Oryza sativa? Plant Sci. 2014; 215-216 :48-58 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Menguer et al., 2017 80. Menguer, P.K. ∙ Sperotto, R.A. ∙ Ricachenevsky, F.K. A walk on the wild side: Oryza species as source for rice abiotic stress tolerance Genet. Mol. Biol. 2017; 40 :238-252 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unfortunately, gene cloning in wild rice is much more difficult than in cultivated rice due to not only the lack of genomic information and transformation systems, but also difficulties in constructing new genetic populations and reflecting the complexity of these desirable traits. Therefore, classical breeding will be needed to maintain these traits without a full understanding of their mechanisms. Fourth, because the wild allotetraploid rice population has a higher genetic diversity, they offer natural genetic resources to be exploited in future functional genomic studies and serve as hybridization in new breeding programs.
Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in rice functional genomics studies with the cloning of many key genes in cultivated rice ( Chen et al., 2019 18.

This has greatly benefited rice breeding by allowing the important alleles from different cultivated varieties to be combined by hybridization. One successful example of rice is the development of new elite rice varieties of both high yield and superior quality ( Tian et al., 2009 103. Tian, Z. ∙ Qian, Q. ∙ Liu, Q. ...

From our experiences in this study, excellent assemblers, sufficient extra-long-read sequencing data, a combination of different sequencing strategies, and selecting the good material with a low heterozygosity rate are critical for assembled polyploid genome. The high-quality O. alta genome will provide a powerful tool for molecular genetic studies of tetraploid rice, the evolution of Oryza species, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the polyploidization of higher plants.
In conclusion, the strategy of the de novo domestication of O. alta , a wild allotetraploid rice, demonstrates a clear path for creating novel crops in the future by combining the advantages of (1) polyploidy, (2) functional genomics knowledge of cultivated crops, (3) desirable attributes of wild species, and (4) rapid genetic modification(s) through genome editing.

The study did not generate new unique reagents.
The sequence data reported in this study have been deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive in BIG Data Center ( http://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa ) under accession number PRJCA002366 .
A total of 44 wild rice accessions were collected, including 28 CCDD species (eight O. alta , two O. grandiglumis , and 18 O. latifolia ), ten CC species, six EE species ( Table S1 ). Plants and the tissue culture plantlets were grown and cultivated in the experimental station and the greenhouses of Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGDB-CAS), Beijing, China (40°22′N and 116°23′E) and/or Hainan (18°31′N and 109°62′E) in the growth season from 2016 to 2020.
Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method ( Allen et al., 2006 1. Allen, G.C. ∙ Flores-Vergara, M.A. ∙ Krasynanski, S. ... A modified protocol for rapid DNA isolation from plant tissues using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2320-2325 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). At least 5 μg of genomic DNA was used for each accession to construct paired-end sequencing libraries with insert sizes of approximately 300 bp. For SMRT PacBio sequencing, a 20-kb insert SMRTbell library was generated using a 15-kb lower-end size selection protocol on a BluePippin (Sage Science). The PPR1 genome was sequenced on the PacBio RS II platform (Pacific Biosciences). PacBio raw reads were processed to filter low-quality reads (RQ > 0.75). The number of 19-mers for corrected PE150 reads was counted using the Genomescope program ( Vurture et al., 2017 108. Vurture, G.W. ∙ Sedlazeck, F.J. ∙ Nattestad, M. ... GenomeScope: fast reference-free genome profiling from short reads Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2202-2204 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). The PPR1 genome size was calculated by dividing the total number of k-mers times of the highest k-mer frequency in the whole genome. The following steps were used to assemble, improve and correct the PPR1 genome assembly. First, ∼121.1 Gb of clean PacBio reads were pre-processed and assembled into contigs using the CANU software ( Koren et al., 2017 53. Koren, S. ∙ Walenz, B.P. ∙ Berlin, K. ... Canu: scalable and accurate long-read assembly via adaptive k -mer weighting and repeat separation Genome Res. 2017; 27 :722-736 Crossref Scopus (1696) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then 287.1 Gb of Bionano data were used for assisting the scaffold construction using Aigner and Assembler ( Shelton et al., 2015 93. Shelton, J.M. ∙ Coleman, M.C. ∙ Herndon, N. ... Tools and pipelines for BioNano data: molecule assembly pipeline and FASTA super scaffolding tool BMC Genomics. 2015; 16 :734 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). To correct and fill gaps for misassembly, the assembler HERA ( Du and Liang, 2019 24. Du, H. ∙ Liang, C. Assembly of chromosome-scale contigs by efficiently resolving repetitive sequences with long reads Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5360 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to update the scaffolds to supercontigs. The resulting supercontigs and scaffolds were integrated using 103.2 Gb of Hi-C data using Juicer ( Durand et al., 2016 26. Durand, N.C. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ∙ Machol, I. ... Juicer provides a one-click system for analyzing loop-resolution Hi-C experiments Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :95-98 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the final round, the 85.2 Gb of Illumina paired-end reads were aligned to PPR1 genome assembly to correct errors using Pilon ( Walker et al., 2014 109. Walker, B.J. ∙ Abeel, T. ∙ Shea, T. ... Pilon: an integrated tool for comprehensive microbial variant detection and genome assembly improvement PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e112963 Crossref Scopus (2008) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Two types of data were retrieved for the identification of homeologous subgenomes in the PPR1 genome: 1) containing BAC sequences ( Ammiraju et al., 2010b 4. Ammiraju, J.S. ∙ Song, X. ∙ Luo, M. ... The Oryza BAC resource: a genus-wide and genome scale tool for exploring rice genome evolution and leveraging useful genetic diversity from wild relatives Breed. Sci. 2010; 60 :536-543 Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar ), and 2) 278 genes generated from CC and EE species ( Zou et al., 2008 136. Zou, X.H. ∙ Zhang, F.M. ∙ Zhang, J.G. ... Analysis of 142 genes resolves the rapid diversification of the rice genus Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R49 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, we aligned these sequences to the PPR1 genome using NCBI BLAST with an E-value cutoff of 1e -5 . Next, the best hits were filtered based on the sequence length of 100 nucleotides and greater than 80% sequence identity. Then, the information of these aligned BAC sequences and genes were used to label the numbers of 24 chromosomes of PPR1 as C t 1-12 and D t 1-12. To obtain homeologous gene pairs between both subgenomes in the PPR1 genome, we first aligned proteins obtained from the C t subgenome against the D t gene set using NCBI BLAST version 2.2.24 ( Camacho et al., 2009 15. Camacho, C. ∙ Coulouris, G. ∙ Avagyan, V. ... BLAST+: architecture and applications BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :421 Crossref Scopus (6214) PubMed Google Scholar ) with an E-value cutoff of 1e -5 . Finally, the best hits were filtered based on 50% amino acid length and a score of more than 50.
Three types of gene prediction methods were combined to annotate the PPR1 genome, including ab initio , assembled transcripts and protein homolog prediction. Four programs, including AUGUSTUS ( Stanke et al., 2004 97. Stanke, M. ∙ Steinkamp, R. ∙ Waack, S. ... AUGUSTUS: a web server for gene finding in eukaryotes Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 W309-12 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ), GENSCAN ( Burge and Karlin, 1997 13. Burge, C. ∙ Karlin, S. Prediction of complete gene structures in human genomic DNA J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268 :78-94 Crossref Scopus (2811) PubMed Google Scholar ), Glimmer-HMM ( Majoros et al., 2004 76. Majoros, W.H. ∙ Pertea, M. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. TigrScan and GlimmerHMM: two open source ab initio eukaryotic gene-finders Bioinformatics. 2004; 20 :2878-2879 Crossref Scopus (515) PubMed Google Scholar ), and SNAP ( Korf, 2004 54. Korf, I. Gene finding in novel genomes BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5 :59 Crossref Scopus (1049) PubMed Google Scholar ) were performed for ab initio prediction. RNA-seq reads from multiple tissues were mapped to the PPR1 genome using TopHat2 ( Kim et al., 2013 51. Kim, D. ∙ Pertea, G. ∙ Trapnell, C. ... TopHat2: accurate alignment of transcriptomes in the presence of insertions, deletions and gene fusions Genome Biol. 2013; 14 :R36 Crossref Scopus (7093) PubMed Google Scholar ), and assembled into transcripts using Cufflinks ( Trapnell et al., 2010 104. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (8514) PubMed Google Scholar ) for gene structures and new genes. Protein sequences from the O. sativa ssp. indica and japonica and uniprot database were aligned to the PPR1 genome using NCBI BLAST (default parameters except for an e-value < 10 −5 ) for homology-based prediction. Accurate spliced sites were identified using GeneWise (version 2.1.20 stable) ( Birney and Durbin, 2000 11. Birney, E. ∙ Durbin, R. Using GeneWise in the Drosophila annotation experiment Genome Res. 2000; 10 :547-548 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ). All predicted gene structure evidence was integrated with EVidenceModeler (EVM) ( Haas et al., 2008 38. Haas, B.J. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. ∙ Zhu, W. ... Automated eukaryotic gene structure annotation using EVidenceModeler and the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R7 Crossref Scopus (735) PubMed Google Scholar ) to produce high-confidence gene models. Gene models were filtered with the parameters: codon length > 150 bp and transcripts supported by homology-base methods. Finally, the resulting gene sets were checked for completeness in comparison with the BUSCO gene set ( Seppey et al., 2019 92. Seppey, M. ∙ Manni, M. ∙ Zdobnov, E.M. BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :227-245 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). The predicted gene models with FPKM > 0.01 in any of RNA-seq samples were labeled as High-Confidence (HC) genes, and other gene models as Low-Confidence (LC) genes.
Gene functions were assigned according to the best match for each predicted gene in alignment to multiple databases including the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database, SWISS-PROT, and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) using the NCBI BLAST program (E-value < 10 −5 ). Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed with InterProScan V5.19-58.0 using the default setting ( Jones et al., 2014 48. Jones, P. ∙ Binns, D. ∙ Chang, H.Y. ... InterProScan 5: genome-scale protein function classification Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1236-1240 Crossref Scopus (2490) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The assembled genome was searched for repeats with a combination of de novo and homolog based strategies. The initial repeat library was built using two de novo programs including RepeatScout ( Price et al., 2005 87. Price, A.L. ∙ Jones, N.C. ∙ Pevzner, P.A. De novo identification of repeat families in large genomes Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :i351-i358 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RECON ( Bao and Eddy, 2002 8. Bao, Z. ∙ Eddy, S.R. Automated de novo identification of repeat sequence families in sequenced genomes Genome Res. 2002; 12 :1269-1276 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). The initial repeat library and the Repbase database for the homolog repeat annotation were classified into classes, subclasses, superfamilies and families by RepeatMasker ( Tarailo-Graovac and Chen, 2009 101. Tarailo-Graovac, M. ∙ Chen, N. Using RepeatMasker to identify repetitive elements in genomic sequences Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2009; Chapter 4 Unit 4.10 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) were identified using RNAmmer with default parameters ( Lagesen et al., 2007 58. Lagesen, K. ∙ Hallin, P. ∙ Rødland, E.A. ... RNAmmer: consistent and rapid annotation of ribosomal RNA genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :3100-3108 Crossref Scopus (3498) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reliable tRNA structures were detected using tRNAscan-SEM (version 1.23) ( Lowe and Eddy, 1997 70. Lowe, T.M. ∙ Eddy, S.R. tRNAscan-SE: a program for improved detection of transfer RNA genes in genomic sequence Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25 :955-964 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Non-coding RNAs containing miRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA features were annotated using INFERNAL with default parameters ( Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013 83. Nawrocki, E.P. ∙ Eddy, S.R. Infernal 1.1: 100-fold faster RNA homology searches Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :2933-2935 Crossref Scopus (832) PubMed Google Scholar ). Noncoding RNAs were classified into different families through searching against the Rfam database.
The resistance genes were annotated using RGAugury ( Li et al., 2016 65. Li, P. ∙ Quan, X. ∙ Jia, G. ... RGAugury: a pipeline for genome-wide prediction of resistance gene analogs (RGAs) in plants BMC Genomics. 2016; 17 :852 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. The transcription factors and transcription regulators were annotated using iTAK (version 18.12) ( Zheng et al., 2016 132. Zheng, Y. ∙ Jiao, C. ∙ Sun, H. ... iTAK: a program for genome-wide prediction and classification of plant transcription factors, transcriptional regulators, and protein kinases Mol. Plant. 2016; 9 :1667-1670 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters.
Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) were scanned in the PPR1 genome using LTR-FINDER ( Xu and Wang, 2007 117. Xu, Z. ∙ Wang, H. LTR_FINDER: an efficient tool for the prediction of full-length LTR retrotransposons Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 W265-8 Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar ) and LTR-Harvest ( Ellinghaus et al., 2008 27. Ellinghaus, D. ∙ Kurtz, S. ∙ Willhoeft, U. LTRharvest, an efficient and flexible software for de novo detection of LTR retrotransposons BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9 :18 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). The identification of complete LTR-RTs was obtained by adjusting the ends of LTR-pair terminal sequences using LTR-retriever ( Ou and Jiang, 2018 85. Ou, S. ∙ Jiang, N. LTR_retriever: a highly accurate and sensitive program for identification of long terminal repeat retrotransposons Plant Physiol. 2018; 176 :1410-1422 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). LTR index of PPR1 is 22.11. LTR insertion times were estimated according to the formula T = d/2μ (d, the nucleotide distance for each pair of LTRs; μ, the nucleotide substitution rate estimated as previously described). The orthologous LTR-RTs in O. alta and Brachypodium distachyon were identified to measure an appropriate LTR nucleotide substitution rate based on the divergence time (∼52.0 MYA) of both species ( Bennetzen et al., 2012 10. Bennetzen, J.L. ∙ Schmutz, J. ∙ Wang, H. ... Reference genome sequence of the model plant Setaria Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :555-561 Crossref Scopus (459) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mutation rate was estimated as 0.65 × 10 −8 substitutions per site per year.
For RNA-seq analysis, 10 representative tissues were collected in the greenhouse, including young tissues of seedling (leaf, stem and root), mature plant tissues (leaf, stem, root, seed, panicle, sheath), and callus. Three biological repeats were made for each tissue except seed and panicle. Total RNA was extracted with the Quick RNA isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Huayueyang, China). RNA libraries (300 bp) were constructed and sequenced using the BGI platform. Raw RNA-seq reads (PE100) were processed to trim terminal low quality bases and adaptor sequences using a custom pipeline. High-quality RNA-seq reads were aligned to the assembled genome using TopHat2 ( Kim et al., 2013 51. Kim, D. ∙ Pertea, G. ∙ Trapnell, C. ... TopHat2: accurate alignment of transcriptomes in the presence of insertions, deletions and gene fusions Genome Biol. 2013; 14 :R36 Crossref Scopus (7093) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. Transcript expression levels, in fragments per kilobase per million reads mapped (FPKM) for each sample, were determined using Cufflinks ( Trapnell et al., 2010 104. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (8514) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differentially expressed homologous pairs on the corresponding chromosomes of the two subgenomes were determined by Student’s t test with Bonferroni correction using 28 samples of RNA-seq.
Ten species, including O. alta , O. sativa , B. distachyon , Aegilops tauschii , Triticum urartu , T. aestivum , T. dicoccoides , Setaria italica , Sorghum bicolor , and Zea mays were selected to construct gene families on the basis of protein homologs (sequence length > 30, e-value < 10 −5 , and alignment length coverage > 50%) using the OrthoMCL ( Li et al., 2003a 61. Li, L. ∙ Stoeckert, Jr., C.J. ∙ Roos, D.S. OrthoMCL: identification of ortholog groups for eukaryotic genomes Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2178-2189 Crossref Scopus (3412) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single-copy families were used to build the phylogenetic tree. For each single-copy gene family, we aligned and clustered the protein sequences from the 10 species with CLUSTALW ( Thompson et al., 1994 102. Thompson, J.D. ∙ Higgins, D.G. ∙ Gibson, T.J. CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 :4673-4680 Crossref Scopus (52636) PubMed Google Scholar ) and transformed the alignments to the phylip format. We determined the best fitting model for the construction of phylogenetic trees using Prottest (version 3.4) ( Darriba et al., 2011 21. Darriba, D. ∙ Taboada, G.L. ∙ Doallo, R. ... ProtTest 3: fast selection of best-fit models of protein evolution Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :1164-1165 Crossref Scopus (1585) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phylogenetic trees were built with PhyML ( Guindon et al., 2010 36. Guindon, S. ∙ Dufayard, J.F. ∙ Lefort, V. ... New algorithms and methods to estimate maximum-likelihood phylogenies: assessing the performance of PhyML 3.0 Syst. Biol. 2010; 59 :307-321 Crossref Scopus (9158) PubMed Google Scholar ) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The divergence time of each node was estimated based on the JC69 model using the MCMCTree program in the PAML package ( Yang, 2007 121. Yang, Z. PAML 4: phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24 :1586-1591 Crossref Scopus (6517) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters except for RooAge (< 2.0). Two reported divergence times were used as a calibration, including ∼26 MYA for Sorghum and Maize, and ∼52 MYA for O. sativa and B. distachyon ( Falush et al., 2003 29. Falush, D. ∙ Stephens, M. ∙ Pritchard, J.K. Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data: linked loci and correlated allele frequencies Genetics. 2003; 164 :1567-1587 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Gain and loss of gene families for the ten species were predicted using DOLLOP ( Farris, 1977 31. Farris, J. Phylogenetic analysis under Dollos Law Syst. Zool. 1977; 26 :77-88 Crossref Google Scholar ) from the PHYLIP package ( Felsenstein, 1989 32. Felsenstein, J. PHYLIP - Phylogeny Inference Package (Version 3.2) Cladistics. 1989; 5 :164-166 Google Scholar ). Expansion and contraction of gene families were determined using CAFÉ ( De Bie et al., 2006 22. De Bie, T. ∙ Cristianini, N. ∙ Demuth, J.P. ... CAFE: a computational tool for the study of gene family evolution Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :1269-1271 Crossref Scopus (465) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the lambda value of 0.184609. A phylogenetic tree from the above study was used as a probabilistic model to infer family expansions and contractions.
Genomic DNA from 44 wild Oryza rice accessions was extracted from fresh young leaves using the CTAB method ( Allen et al., 2006 1. Allen, G.C. ∙ Flores-Vergara, M.A. ∙ Krasynanski, S. ... A modified protocol for rapid DNA isolation from plant tissues using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2320-2325 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). All accessions were re-sequenced on the Illumina NovoSeq 5000 or BGISEG-500 platform, generating 150-bp or 100-bp paired-end reads. All sequence reads from the 44 accessions were aligned to the PPR1 reference genome using BWA ( Li and Durbin, 2009 60. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (19515) PubMed Google Scholar ) and SAMtools ( Li et al., 2009 63. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (22121) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the default parameters. Variations (SNP and INDEL) were detected with GATK ( McKenna et al., 2010 78. McKenna, A. ∙ Hanna, M. ∙ Banks, E. ... The Genome Analysis Toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data Genome Res. 2010; 20 :1297-1303 Crossref Scopus (10827) PubMed Google Scholar ) with base quality ≥ 30. The identified variations were further categorized as variations in intergenic regions, UTRs, coding sequences and introns according to the PPR1 genome annotation using snpEFF ( Cingolani et al., 2012 19. Cingolani, P. ∙ Platts, A. ∙ Wang, L. ... A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118 ; iso-2 ; iso-3 Fly (Austin). 2012; 6 :80-92 Crossref Scopus (3715) PubMed Google Scholar ). To build a neighbor-joining tree, we screened a subset of 524,933 SNPs (MAF > 5% and missing data < 40%) at fourfold-degenerate sites in the 44 rice accessions from the entire SNP dataset. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using PHYLIP with 100 bootstrap replicates. Using the same dataset, we also investigated the population structure using STRUCTURE on the basis of allele frequencies ( Falush et al., 2003 29. Falush, D. ∙ Stephens, M. ∙ Pritchard, J.K. Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data: linked loci and correlated allele frequencies Genetics. 2003; 164 :1567-1587 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, principal-component analysis (PCA) was generated using all SNPs across the genome (MAF > 10%, missing < 5%) ( Patterson et al., 2006 86. Patterson, N. ∙ Price, A.L. ∙ Reich, D. Population structure and eigenanalysis PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e190 Crossref Scopus (2442) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nucleotide diversity for each group was measured based on the degree of variability ( Tajima, 1983 99. Tajima, F. Evolutionary relationship of DNA sequences in finite populations Genetics. 1983; 105 :437-460 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The level of genetic diversity was calculated using a 100-kb window with a step size of 10 kb in each group.
For each pairwise alignment, the coding sequences of predicted gene models were compared to each other using all-versus-all BLASTP (e-value < 10 −5 ) within the PPR1 genome. Syntenic blocks (with at least five genes per block) were identified by MCScan ( Tang et al., 2008 100. Tang, H. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Bowers, J.E. ... Unraveling ancient hexaploidy through multiply-aligned angiosperm gene maps Genome Res. 2008; 18 :1944-1954 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the default parameters. The collinear blocks represented pairs of genomic sequences containing at least five collinear genes. Whole-genome syntenic relationships between the species were visualized using Circos ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 55. Krzywinski, M. ∙ Schein, J. ∙ Birol, I. ... Circos: an information aesthetic for comparative genomics Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1639-1645 Crossref Scopus (4781) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify homologous genes related to domestication in O. sativa in the O. alta genome, the genes in diploid rice were first aligned against the PPR1 gene set using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of 1e -5 . Next, the best hits were filtered based on 50% amino acid length and a score of more than 50. The top two best-matched results were assigned as the homologs for the following studies in the domestication-related and agronomically important genes.
The genetic transformation system of O. alta was established as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2016 128. Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Gao, C. Generation of stable transgenic rice ( Oryza sativa L.) by agrobacterium -mediated transformation Curr. Protoc. Plant Biol. 2016; 1 :235-246 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications, which are briefly described as following.
Callus induction and proliferation. (1) The mature dehusked seeds without pathogen spots were surface-sterilized with ethanol and bleach solution. (2) The sterilized seeds were transferred to the M1 calli induction medium ( Zhang et al., 2016 128. Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Gao, C. Generation of stable transgenic rice ( Oryza sativa L.) by agrobacterium -mediated transformation Curr. Protoc. Plant Biol. 2016; 1 :235-246 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with the modification of replacing the sucrose with maltose and incubated in dark at 28°C. (3) After 15 days, calli were formed from the scutella of mature seeds. Embryogenic calli with a granular structure, smooth surface and creamy/yellow color were selected and subcultured in fresh M1 medium in the dark at 28°C for 15 days after removing the seedling and seed structures. The selection of embryogenic calli from non-embryogenic calli is essential. (4) The subculturing process can be repeated a few times to get more calli, but should be performed for less than a three-month period.
Transformation and selection. (1) Activation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA 105 containing constructs of interest was performed as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2016 128. Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Gao, C. Generation of stable transgenic rice ( Oryza sativa L.) by agrobacterium -mediated transformation Curr. Protoc. Plant Biol. 2016; 1 :235-246 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). (2) The Agrobacterium was then resuspended in cooled (10°C) fresh infection medium (supplemented with freshly prepared 200 μM acetosyringone and 0.1% Pluronic F68) and adjusted to an optical density with OD 600 0.5 and placed on ice for 10-20 minutes. (3) For infection, the Agrobacterium cell suspension was poured into the flask immersing the calli, and the flask was then gently shaken at 40 rpm for 10 minutes. The calli were placed onto a stack of sterile filter paper in the dishes and co-cultivated in the dark at 22°C for 3 days. (4) After co-cultivation, the infected calli were transferred to freshly prepared solid M2 selection medium and were cultured in the dark at 28°C for 7 days. The calli were sub-cultured by changing the fresh selection medium every two weeks for three cycles. The newly formed hygromycin B resistant and actively growing micro-calli were subcultured under the same conditions.
Regeneration and hardening of transgenic plants. (1) Embryogenic resistant calli were transferred to solid M5 regeneration medium and incubated at 28°C in the dark for 1 week, and then place in a 16-hour light/8-hour dark photoperiod for 3 weeks under cold fluorescent light with an intensity 50 - 100 μE m -2 s -1 . Green spots in the calli and newly formed shoots could be seen in 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. (2) After 4 weeks, regenerated shoots were transferred to M6 rooting medium and incubated at 28°C until the shoots grew to 10 cm. (3) Plants were then hardened by opening the lid of the medium at 28°C for 5 days with watering. Finally, the plants were washed with warm water and transplanted to soil in the greenhouse or field.
Single-guiding RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed using the CRISPR-GE tool ( http://skl.scau.edu.cn/ ) ( Xie et al., 2017 116. Xie, X. ∙ Ma, X. ∙ Zhu, Q. ... CRISPR-GE: a convenient software toolkit for crispr-based genome editing Mol. Plant. 2017; 10 :1246-1249 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sgRNAs used in this study are listed in Table S6 . The sgRNAs were cloned by enzyme digestion and ligation methods into the binary vector VK005-01 for single gene editing and A3A-PBE for base editing, or generated into sgRNAs expression cassettes using the overlapping PCR method and then cloned by the Golden Gate cloning method into pYLCRISPR/Cas9P ubi -H for multiplex gene editing ( Ma et al., 2015a 74. Ma, X. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Zhu, Q. ... A robust CRISPR/Cas9 system for convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in monocot and dicot plants Mol. Plant. 2015; 8 :1274-1284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zong et al., 2018 135. Zong, Y. ∙ Song, Q. ∙ Li, C. ... Efficient C-to-T base editing in plants using a fusion of nCas9 and human APOBEC3A Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :950-953 Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar ). The final binary vector was transformed into PPR1 by the established Agrobacterium -mediated transformation methods. For genotyping of the T 0 transgenic lines, leaves of T 0 transgenic lines were collected from each plant and genomic DNA was isolated using the CTAB method ( Allen et al., 2006 1. Allen, G.C. ∙ Flores-Vergara, M.A. ∙ Krasynanski, S. ... A modified protocol for rapid DNA isolation from plant tissues using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2320-2325 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCR amplification was performed using primers flanking the sgRNA target sites ( Table S6 ) and Sanger sequencing was used to identify mutations in target genes of T 0 plants.
The T 0 seedlings of OaGhd7-CC , OaGhd7-DD , OaDTH7-CC , and OaDTH7-DD edited plants and the wild-type PPR1 were refined in the greenhouse of Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology in Beijing, and then transplanted to the experimental fields of Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology in Beijing when the plants grown up to 20 cm, and the picture of all lines was taken 110 days after transplantation. The T 0 seedlings of other edited plants and wild-type PPR1 were refined in the greenhouse of Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology in Beijing, and then transplanted to the experimental fields of Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology in Hainan.
The grain length was measure by the Scan Marker i560 (MICROTEK). The cross section photos of the stems were taken by stereomicroscope (OLYMPUS, SZX16) and the diameter of the third internodes of primary tillers were measured by vernier caliper. To observe abscission cells, the histochemical analysis was performed based on methods in Yoon et al. (2014) 123. Yoon, J. ∙ Cho, L.H. ∙ Kim, S.L. ... The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis Plant J. 2014; 79 :717-728 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar with some modifications. Samples were fixed in formaldehyde–acetic acid–alcohol solution. The tissue-paraffin block was cut to a thickness of 8 μm with a microtome (Leica Microsystems, RM2145). The cut samples were attached to a coated slide with sterile water on 42°C hot-plate, rehydrated with 100% xylene 10 min twice for clearing wax, and washed in 50% xylene (xylene in ethanol) and ethanol series (100, 100, 95, 85, 70, 50 and 30%). The samples were stained with phloroglucinol (saturated phloroglucinol in 20% HCl) until sections turned red. The sections were covered with acidic glycerol and then observed under a microscope (Leica, DMR).
The total RNA of stem base was extracted using a TRIzol Kit by three biological repeats (Invitrogen, Cat#15596018) according to the user’s manual. About 1.5 μg of each RNA sample was used for cDNA synthesis (Maxima H Minus cDNA Synthesis Master Mix, with dsDNase, Thermo Scientific, Cat#M1682). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using primer pairs (see KEY RESOURCES TABLE) in the SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, Cat#1725201) with the real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, CFX96). PCR reactions were performed in quadruplicate for each sample, and expression levels were normalized to OaUBI for expression detection. The experiments were repeated independently three times.
The statistical details of experiments can be found in the figure legends, including the statistical tests used, exact value of n, what n represents, definition of center, and dispersion measures. Comparisons for two groups were calculated using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests, and statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2016. Results are represented as mean ± s.d. P values < 0.01 were considered significant, with levels of significance as follows: ∗∗ p < 0.01; ns, not significant. We observed normal distribution and no difference in variance between groups in individual comparisons. The selection of sample size was based on extensive experience. Further methods to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach were not relevant for these analyses.
