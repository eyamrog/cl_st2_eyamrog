Title: Phase precession in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex


Abstract: Summary

Knowing where we are, where we have been, and where we are going is critical to many behaviors, including navigation and memory. One potential neuronal mechanism underlying this ability is phase precession, in which spatially tuned neurons represent sequences of positions by activating at progressively earlier phases of local network theta oscillations. Based on studies in rodents, researchers have hypothesized that phase precession may be a general neural pattern for representing sequential events for learning and memory. By recording human single-neuron activity during spatial navigation, we show that spatially tuned neurons in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibit phase precession. Furthermore, beyond the neural representation of locations, we show evidence for phase precession related to specific goal states. Our findings thus extend theta phase precession to humans and suggest that this phenomenon has a broad functional role for the neural representation of both spatial and non-spatial information.

Section: Introduction

Our brain’s ability to link related experiences is critical to everyday life. One crucial example is spatial navigation, which requires awareness of individual locations and the association between multiple locations, such as those on the same path. Similarly, episodic memory requires the encoding of individual events and associations between sequentially occurring events. Because the hippocampal formation is necessary for spatial cognition and episodic memory ( Scoville and Milner, 1957 92. Scoville, W.B. ∙ Milner, B.

Specifically, one set of theories suggests that the spike timing of hippocampal neurons is critical for learning the associations between events in a sequence ( Hebb, 1949 36. Hebb, D.O.

Spike timing, in turn, is thought to be coordinated by fluctuations in the large-scale network activity that can be estimated via the local field potential (LFP) ( Bragin et al., 1995 7.

The origin of extracellular fields and currents--EEG, ECoG, LFP and spikes Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13 :407-420 Crossref Scopus (1764) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this way, a consistent relationship between network oscillations and single-neuron spiking may help to encode sequences and thus play a mechanistic role in complex behaviors or aspects of cognition, such as memory, that rely on relational processing ( Siegel et al., 2009 95. Siegel, M. ∙ Warden, M.R. ∙ Miller, E.K. Phase-dependent neuronal coding of objects in short-term memory Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :21341-21346 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rutishauser et al., 2010 88. Rutishauser, U. ∙ Ross, I.B. ∙ Mamelak, A.N. ... Human memory strength is predicted by theta-frequency phase-locking of single neurons Nature. 2010; 464 :903-907 Crossref Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Critically, in rodents, neuronal activity in the hippocampal formation exhibits coordination between the LFP and spike timing via phase precession, in which active neurons rhythmically spike in coordination with the local theta frequency (∼5–10 Hz) oscillation. As such, phase precession may be a potential mechanism for the binding and compressing of sequential events. Phase precession is readily observable in hippocampal place cells ( O’Keefe and Recce, 1993 76. O’Keefe, J. ∙ Recce, M.L. Phase relationship between hippocampal place units and the EEG theta rhythm Hippocampus. 1993; 3 :317-330 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and entorhinal grid cells ( Hafting et al., 2005 32. Hafting, T. ∙ Fyhn, M. ∙ Molden, S. ... Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex Nature. 2005; 436 :801-806 Crossref Scopus (2121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reifenstein et al., 2012 83.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :6301-6306 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar )—these neurons consistently spike slightly faster than the theta oscillation as the rodent runs through specific locations, resulting in sequences of locations within the field being encoded at different phases of theta oscillations. Consequently, as an animal crosses through consecutive place fields, this phase code ensures that the corresponding sequence of place cells fires in order within a single theta cycle ( Skaggs et al., 1996 97. Skaggs, W.E. ∙ McNaughton, B.L. ∙ Wilson, M.A. ... Theta phase precession in hippocampal neuronal populations and the compression of temporal sequences Hippocampus. 1996; 6 :149-172 Crossref Scopus (1034) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, phase precession may compress spatial trajectories on the scale of behavior into the brief timescale of the theta cycle that is conducive to synaptic plasticity ( Lisman and Idiart, 1995 59.

Reifenstein, E.T. ∙ Kempter, R. Synaptic learning rules for sequence learning bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
In addition to representing space, there is evidence that phase precession’s utility for binding and compressing sequential events may be used by the brain to represent non-spatial features of experience as well. Although phase precession is often described in hippocampal place cells or entorhinal grid cells, it has also been observed in a diverse range of brain areas such as ventral striatum ( van der Meer and Redish, 2011 107. van der Meer, M.A.A. ∙ Redish, A.D. Theta phase precession in rat ventral striatum links place and reward information J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :2843-2854 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), subiculum ( Kim et al., 2012 56.

Neurosci. 2012; 32 :11539-11558 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), basal forebrain ( Tingley et al., 2018 104. Tingley, D. ∙ Alexander, A.S. ∙ Quinn, L.K. ... Multiplexed oscillations and phase rate coding in the basal forebrain Sci. Adv. 2018; 4 :eaar3230 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and medial prefrontal cortex ( Jones and Wilson, 2005 52. Jones, M.W. ∙ Wilson, M.A. Phase precession of medial prefrontal cortical activity relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm Hippocampus. 2005; 15 :867-873 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Critically, recent work in rodents has reported phase precession independent of location, encoding elapsed time during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep ( Harris et al., 2002 34.

Tingley, D. ∙ Alexander, A.S. ∙ Quinn, L.K. ... Multiplexed oscillations and phase rate coding in the basal forebrain Sci. Adv. 2018; 4 :eaar3230 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The widespread prevalence of phase precession suggests that this phenomenon has a more general role beyond representing the current spatial location, and it could be relevant for building neural representations in many regions to support diverse aspects of cognition, learning, and memory.
Many theories suggest a fundamental role for phase precession in neural coding ( O’Keefe and Recce, 1993 76. O’Keefe, J. ∙ Recce, M.L. Phase relationship between hippocampal place units and the EEG theta rhythm Hippocampus. 1993; 3 :317-330 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Burgess et al., 1994 10.

Jaramillo, J. ∙ Kempter, R. Phase precession: a neural code underlying episodic memory? Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 43 :130-138 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet phase precession has almost exclusively been studied in rodents. To examine the prevalence and importance of phase precession in humans, we analyzed simultaneous single-neuron and LFP activity from neurosurgical patients as they performed a virtual spatial memory task and examined the patterns of spike-LFP interaction. Here, we describe spatial phase precession in humans analogous to that observed in navigating rodents. We also describe evidence for phase precession related to the coding of non-spatial variables, in which neurons transiently spike with a rhythm faster than the theta oscillation during trajectories to specific goals. Overall, our findings extend precession to humans and demonstrate its potential use for encoding both spatial and non-spatial features of experience.

Section: Results

We analyzed recordings of neuronal spiking from 1,074 neurons in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala of 13 neurosurgical patients undergoing clinical treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. During recordings, subjects performed a goal-directed navigation task in a 2D virtual environment on a laptop computer ( Jacobs et al., 2010 47. Jacobs, J. ∙ Kahana, M.J. ∙ Ekstrom, A.D. ... A sense of direction in human entorhinal cortex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :6487-6492 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ; Miller et al., 2015 66. Miller, J.F. ∙ Fried, I. ∙ Suthana, N. ... Repeating spatial activations in human entorhinal cortex Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :1080-1085 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see STAR Methods ). The virtual environment contained six goal stores surrounding the perimeter of a square track, with the center of the environment obstructed by buildings. Subjects were able to travel around the track in either clockwise or counterclockwise directions ( Figure 1 A).
Given our interest in phase coding, we first characterized the prevalence of theta oscillations in the human hippocampus and compared their properties to those seen in rodents, leveraging a publicly available dataset ( Mizuseki et al., 2009a 67. Mizuseki, K. ∙ Sirota, A. ∙ Pastalkova, E. ... Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop Neuron. 2009; 64 :267-280 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to rodents, human hippocampal theta spanned a significantly broader range of frequencies (p < 4 × 10 −4 , Levene test), with significantly smaller, lower-frequency peaks in the power spectrum (p < 3 × 10 −8 , Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 A). Because human theta appears to span both low and high frequencies ( Goyal et al., 2020 30. Goyal, A. ∙ Miller, J. ∙ Qasim, S.E. ... Functionally distinct high and low theta oscillations in the human hippocampus Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2469 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) and because phase coding may be robust to changes in theta frequencies ( Petersen and Buzsáki, 2020 78. Petersen, P.C. ∙ Buzsáki, G. Cooling of medial septum reveals theta phase lag coordination of hippocampal cell assemblies Neuron. 2020; 107 :731-744.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), we assessed phase precession with respect to oscillations within a range of LFP theta frequencies (2–10 Hz) ( Figure 1 C). Identifying phase precession in this broader range of frequencies would demonstrate that precession might generalize to brain regions and species that exhibit heterogeneous low-frequency signals, in line with recent work identifying phase precession relative to non-rhythmic (2–10 Hz) LFP in bats ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and shorter theta bouts in humans and non-human primates ( Watrous et al., 2013 110. Watrous, A.J. ∙ Lee, D.J. ∙ Izadi, A. ... A comparative study of human and rat hippocampal low-frequency oscillations during spatial navigation Hippocampus. 2013; 23 :656-661 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jutras et al., 2013 53. Jutras, M.J. ∙ Fries, P. ∙ Buffalo, E.A. Oscillatory activity in the monkey hippocampus during visual exploration and memory formation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :13144-13149 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Killian et al., 2012 55. Killian, N.J. ∙ Jutras, M.J. ∙ Buffalo, E.A. A map of visual space in the primate entorhinal cortex Nature. 2012; 491 :761-764 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To assess phase precession, we first identified each neuron whose firing was modulated by the subject’s position in the virtual environment. We labeled the clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) navigation periods and then used a permutation testing procedure to identify 296 spatially modulated neurons that fired significantly more when subjects moved through particular locations in one or both of these directions ( Jacobs and Kahana, 2010 45. Jacobs, J. ∙ Kahana, M.J. Direct brain recordings fuel advances in cognitive electrophysiology Trends Cogn. Sci. 2010; 14 :162-171 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), after correcting for multiple comparisons (see STAR Methods ). Because phase precession in rodents is most predominant near the place-field center ( Souza and Tort, 2017 98. Souza, B.C. ∙ Tort, A.B.L. Asymmetry of the temporal code for space by hippocampal place cells Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8507 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ) and on short trajectories ( Reifenstein et al., 2014 84. Reifenstein, E. ∙ Stemmler, M. ∙ Herz, A.V.M. ... Movement dependence and layer specificity of entorhinal phase precession in two-dimensional environments PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e100638 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested for phase precession during short trajectories through the field center, defined as the peak firing location for each neuron ( Figures 2 A–2C).
We observed that some of the spatially tuned neurons showed spiking at progressively earlier phases of the theta oscillation during individual trajectories through their firing field ( Figures 2 D, S2 A, and S2B). To assess if this was a consistent pattern across trajectories, we leveraged the fact that during phase precession, spikes at later positions in the trajectory should occur at earlier phases, manifesting as a negative correlation between spike-phase and position ( O’Keefe and Recce, 1993 76. O’Keefe, J. ∙ Recce, M.L. Phase relationship between hippocampal place units and the EEG theta rhythm Hippocampus. 1993; 3 :317-330 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In this way, spiking at different phases of the LFP would correspond to different relative positions along the path to a neuron’s firing field center ( Figures 2 A–2C). We tested for this pattern by measuring the correlation ( Kempter et al., 2012 54. Kempter, R. ∙ Leibold, C. ∙ Buzsáki, G. ... Quantifying circular-linear associations: hippocampal phase precession J. Neurosci. Methods. 2012; 207 :113-124 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) between spike-phase and position using circular statistics ( Fisher, 1993 26. Fisher, N.I. Statistical Analysis of Circular Data Cambridge University Press, 1993 Crossref Google Scholar ) and a shuffle-based permutation procedure (see STAR Methods ).
By performing this procedure across all of the identified spatially tuned neurons, we report evidence of phase precession in humans. Figure 2 D shows three examples of neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex whose spiking exhibited significant phase precession during navigation at particular spatial locations (see Figures S3 A and S3B for additional examples). Each of these neurons increased their firing in a specific region of the environment ( Figure 2 D, left). As a person approached the center of that region, the neuron initially spiked at late phases of the 2–10 Hz LFP but as they continued their trajectory through the center and past it, spikes occurred at progressively earlier phases ( Figures 2 D, middle, and S3 C). This change in spike phases between early positions and late positions is characterized by a significant negative phase-position correlation ( Figure 2 D, right).
After testing all spatially tuned neurons in our dataset for phase precession, we found that precession was widespread, with 12% (35/296) of neurons exhibiting this phenomenon ( Table S1 ), which is well above chance (p < 3 × 10 −6 , binomial test) ( Figures 3 A and S3 D). Of these 35 neurons, 22 exhibited uni-directional spatial tuning and precession and 10 exhibited bi-directional spatial tuning and precession. The remaining three neurons exhibited uni-directional precession in one location and bi-directional precession in another. A smaller proportion of neurons (22/296) exhibited a positive correlation between position and phase ( Wang et al., 2020 109. Wang, M. ∙ Foster, D.J. ∙ Pfeiffer, B.E. Alternating sequences of future and past behavior encoded within hippocampal theta oscillations Science. 2020; 370 :247-250 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ) (p = 0.06, binomial test).
Notably, we specifically observed significant proportions of spatially modulated cells exhibiting spatial phase precession in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (p < 0.002, binomial test) ( Figure 3 B). Phase-precessing neurons exhibited an average circular-linear correlation coefficient of −0.26 ± 0.09 and an average slope of −1.36 ± 0.8 radians/VR-unit ( Figure 3 C), suggesting an average phase range of 1.8π radians across the entire field. Phase-precessing neurons’ average in-field firing rate was 4.9 ±1.7 Hz ( Figure 3 D), and they had spatial firing fields throughout the environment ( Figure 3 E). To test whether spatial phase precession was consistent across an entire behavioral session, we separately computed the phase-position correlation for the first and second halves of the session and found no significant difference in correlation coefficient or slope between halves (p > 0.4, paired t test), with significant negative correlation coefficients in each half when measured individually (p < 0.002, one-sample t tests). We found neurons demonstrating spatial phase precession in all 12 of the subjects with spatially modulated neurons. Overall, these results thus demonstrate the existence of phase precession as a neural code for spatial position in humans during virtual navigation. Specifically, the theta frequency (2–10 Hz) and regions involved (hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) suggest that this phenomenon in humans is analogous to the phase precession found in rodent place and grid cells.
These analyses specifically tested for phase precession in the location in the virtual environment where the cell was most active. To confirm that precession indicated a spatial phase code relative to these specific locations, we tested two alternative explanations for our results. We assessed whether precession was equally prevalent at randomly selected spatial locations (in which the neuron was sufficiently active), or that precession was actually measuring the advance of spike phase according to elapsed time ( Figures S4 A and S4C; STAR Methods ). Neither alternative model identified significant proportions of phase-precessing cells, and these models resulted in the identification of a smaller number of cells as compared to our primary analyses (χ 2 = 20.6, p < 4 × 10 −5 , chi-square test) ( Figures 3 A, S4 B, and S4D). These results indicate that human phase precession occurs more strongly at locations that are associated with elevated firing rates, and that phase precession in spatially tuned neurons during navigation is more closely tied to location than elapsed time. Furthermore, we also found that the position–phase correlation was significantly stronger than the correlation between rate and phase ( Huxter et al., 2003 42. Huxter, J. ∙ Burgess, N. ∙ O’Keefe, J. Independent rate and temporal coding in hippocampal pyramidal cells Nature. 2003; 425 :828-832 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ; Monaco et al., 2019 70.

Biol. 2019; 15 :e1006741 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ) (p < 2 × 10 −8 , paired t test), suggesting that spike phase more strongly encoded position than the instantaneous firing rate ( Figure S3 E).
Although phase precession has been observed most readily relative to specific spatial locations, there is also evidence for precession with respect to non-spatial behaviors and stimuli ( Aronov et al., 2017 2.

Theta phase precession in rat ventral striatum links place and reward information J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :2843-2854 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggest that phase precession could be a more general phenomenon that the brain uses to represent diverse types of consecutive, relevant stimuli/states using different frequencies or phases of an oscillation. To examine this possibility, we used a broader analytical method to identify the non-spatially tuned neurons that exhibited phase precession without reference to a specific position. To do this, we measured each neuron’s rhythmic frequency of spiking in comparison to the local theta oscillation ( Geisler et al., 2007 28. Geisler, C. ∙ Robbe, D. ∙ Zugaro, M. ...

Identifying a consistent pattern of faster-than-LFP rhythmic spiking would indicate the presence of a precession-like pattern of LFP-coordinated spiking that could bind and compress sequential, non-spatial features of the task—just as spatial phase precession is theorized to do for locations ( Bush and Burgess, 2020 12.

We identified neurons that showed rhythmic spiking at a frequency faster than the theta oscillation by using a phase-unwrapping method that has identified this pattern both in animals with very stereotyped, 8-Hz theta such as rats ( Mizuseki et al., 2009a 67.

Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and non-human primates ( Stewart and Fox, 1991 99. Stewart, M. ∙ Fox, S.E. Hippocampal theta activity in monkeys Brain Res. 1991; 538 :59-63 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Killian et al., 2012 55.

USA. 2013; 110 :13144-13149 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, in this method, we first measured the theta phase estimate for each spike from the concurrent 2–10 Hz LFP and “unwrapped” the circular phase time series so that it increased linearly. We then measured the spike-phase spectrum, which we defined as the power spectral density of the time series of unwrapped spike phases ( STAR Methods ). In contrast to conventional spectral analysis that measures the frequency of a signal relative to absolute time, the spike-phase spectra reflects the relative frequency of rhythmic spiking compared to the progression of unwrapped phase of the LFP oscillation. If a spike-phase spectra showed a peak at a relative frequency >1.0, it would indicate that the frequency of a neuron’s rhythmic spiking was faster than that of the concurrent oscillations in the LFP, and thus the phase of this neuron’s spiking exhibited precession relative to the LFP ( Figure 4 A). Importantly, this method ensures that a consistent relationship between the spiking frequency and LFP frequency can be identified even if the LFP shifts in frequency or amplitude, and even though neuronal spike times alone may not show a clear oscillation ( Figure S1 B), as is the case in humans and bats ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We validated this method by applying it to data from rodent CA1 and identifying a consistent >1.0 relative frequency ( Figures S1 C and S1D), consistent with the spatial phase precession observed in these neurons ( Mizuseki et al., 2009a 67. Mizuseki, K. ∙ Sirota, A. ∙ Pastalkova, E. ... Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop Neuron. 2009; 64 :267-280 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To assess whether precession-like rhythmic spiking was evident for non-spatially tuned cells, we used this method to analyze the spiking of the 744 neurons that were active during the task but did not exhibit significant spatial tuning. Figure 4 B depicts an example neuron that we identified with this method that showed significant precession. This analysis found that the rhythmicity of this cell’s spiking occurred at a frequency that reliably exceeded the frequency of the LFP (right panel), although no consistent rhythm is apparent from the spike timing alone (left panel). Using this method, we found that 20% of non-spatially tuned neurons (146/744) showed a significant relationship between neuronal spiking frequency and LFP frequency ( Figure 4 C), with 90 of these neurons showing evidence of precession by having a relative frequency >1.0 ( Figure 4 D). Precession-like rhythmic spiking was thus significantly more prevalent than expected by chance (p < 7 × 10 −18 , binomial test) ( Figure 4 E). The set of neurons that showed precession was also larger (χ 2 = 8.8, p = 0.003) and involved higher mean firing rates (p = 0.04) than the set of cells with a relative spike frequency ≤1.0. None of the 90 neurons exhibiting precession had a mean firing rate exceeding 10 Hz, suggesting that these cells were not theta-modulated interneurons (“theta cells”) ( Ranck, 1973 80. Ranck, Jr., J.B. Studies on single neurons in dorsal hippocampal formation and septum in unrestrained rats. I. Behavioral correlates and firing repertoires Exp. Neurol. 1973; 41 :461-531 Crossref Scopus (914) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We performed a control analysis ( Figure S4 C) to rule out the possibility that these effects could be explained by the absolute spike timing relative to elapsed clock time, although this was unlikely given the relative lack of intrinsic rhythmicity in the spiking measured by clock time ( Figure S1 B). This analysis confirmed that most of these neurons show phase precession only when spiking is measured relative to the instantaneous ongoing oscillation rather than absolute elapsed time ( Petersen and Buzsáki, 2020 78. Petersen, P.C. ∙ Buzsáki, G. Cooling of medial septum reveals theta phase lag coordination of hippocampal cell assemblies Neuron. 2020; 107 :731-744.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 E). These results illustrate how the frequency variability of human hippocampal theta ( Goyal et al., 2020 30. Goyal, A. ∙ Miller, J. ∙ Qasim, S.E. ... Functionally distinct high and low theta oscillations in the human hippocampus Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2469 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) may diminish traditional measures of phase precession, and demonstrate the potential for phase precession in neurons that are not spatially tuned. We next sought to test whether this new non-spatial precession pattern might vary behaviorally in relation to non-spatial, higher-level features of the task, such as prospective goals.
Having shown that non-spatially tuned neurons can exhibit phase precession, we next tested whether this was a tonic pattern ( Harvey et al., 2009 35. Harvey, C.D. ∙ Collman, F. ∙ Dombeck, D.A. ... Intracellular dynamics of hippocampal place cells during virtual navigation Nature. 2009; 461 :941-946 Crossref Scopus (555) PubMed Google Scholar ) or, alternatively, one that emerged selectively to code for specific stimuli or behavioral states. Specifically, recent work has shown that human hippocampal-cortical networks represent goals and their intermediate locations ( Brown et al., 2016 8. Brown, T.I. ∙ Carr, V.A. ∙ LaRocque, K.F. ... Prospective representation of navigational goals in the human hippocampus Science. 2016; 352 :1323-1326 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ); furthermore we found previously that this task elicits distinctive patterns of rate- and phase-coding for goals ( Watrous et al., 2018 111. Watrous, A.J. ∙ Miller, J. ∙ Qasim, S.E. ... Phase-tuned neuronal firing encodes human contextual representations for navigational goals eLife. 2018; 7 :e32554 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we assessed whether phase precession emerged selectively during trajectories to specific goals in service of binding those trajectories for learning and memory.
During each trial of this task, the subject was cued to travel to a randomly selected goal location ( Figure 5 A). We found that some neurons specifically showed phase precession only during travel to particular goals. Figure 5 B shows an example of a neuron whose spiking shows phase precession during navigation to goal 2, but not the other goals. This effect is evident in the spike-phase autocorrelogram for that goal, which shows that during travel to goal 2, rhythmic spiking occurs at a frequency slightly faster than the ongoing 2–10 Hz LFP. To systematically test for goal-state phase precession, we measured the spike-phase spectrum during trajectories to each goal and compared these spectra between goals, using a permutation procedure and correcting for multiple comparisons across goals ( Figure 5 C; STAR Methods ). Figure 5 D depicts two example neurons that show this pattern, from the cingulate and amygdala of two different subjects (see Figure S5 for additional examples). These neurons exhibited rhythmic spiking at faster frequencies than the ongoing LFP while the subjects were en route to specific goals. Critically, this rhythmic spiking was goal-specific and did not appear during trajectories to other goals. These patterns were thus examples of phase precession for a particular goal-state, similar to phase precession in a place field.
We applied this method to the 448 neurons that were sufficiently active during each goal. We excluded spatially tuned neurons, to ensure that spatial phase precession did not confound the analysis. We found a population of neurons exhibiting a significant pattern of faster-than-LFP rhythmic spiking during trajectories to at least one goal ( Figure 6 A), across a range of relative frequencies ( Figure 6 B). Overall, 11% of the neurons we analyzed (49/448) exhibited significant goal-state precession ( Table S2 ), with at least one neuron exhibiting goal-state phase precession in 10/13 subjects. We examined the specificity of goal-state precession, and found that a majority of these neurons only exhibited significant precession during trajectories to one goal ( Figure 6 C); furthermore, other patterns of rhythmic spiking (equal to or slower than theta frequency) were also absent during trajectories to other goals. Next, we found that only 4/49 neurons exhibiting goal-state precession showed consistent spike-phases across the start or end of goal trajectories (as in Figure 5 B), suggesting that the spike-LFP frequency difference may be more important for encoding information than specific phases. Goal-state phase precession was present at significant levels in anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, but not parahippocampal gyrus or entorhinal cortex (p < 0.02, binomial test) ( Figure 6 D).
To confirm that goal-state precession was stable across an entire behavioral session, we computed the correlation between the goal-specific spike-phase spectra for the first and second halves of the session and found they were significantly positively correlated (ρ = 0.36 ± 0.4; Figure S6 A; p = 0.0001, t test). We also performed a series of control analyses to test the possibility that our observation of precession for specific goal states was confounded by between-goal differences in LFP power or neuronal firing rate ( Figure 6 E). Indeed, neither example neuron in Figure 5 exhibited increased firing rates during goals that showed precession, which suggests that goal-state precession was independent of goal-specific firing rate increases ( Watrous et al., 2018 111. Watrous, A.J. ∙ Miller, J. ∙ Qasim, S.E. ... Phase-tuned neuronal firing encodes human contextual representations for navigational goals eLife. 2018; 7 :e32554 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neurons exhibiting goal-state precession had lower mean firing rates than those that exhibited spatial phase precession (p < 3 × 10 −4 ). Furthermore, only 17 of the 49 neurons that showed goal-state precession also showed increased goal-specific firing rate increases (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA), and only 2 of 17 of these neurons showed precession and a firing rate increase for the same goal ( Robinson et al., 2017 85. Robinson, N.T.M. ∙ Priestley, J.B. ∙ Rueckemann, J.W. ... Medial entorhinal cortex selectively supports temporal coding by hippocampal neurons Neuron. 2017; 94 :677-688.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 F). Next, we tested whether subject performance on different goals might be responsible for our results (i.e., whether precession might occur when subjects perform more efficient navigation). However, we measured subject’s performance on each goal ( STAR Methods ) and found no significant difference in navigational performance between goals that elicited precession and those that did not ( Figures S6 B and S6C).
We considered the possibility that a neuron might show goal-state precession if that neuron had a place field that only emerged during trajectories to the goal in question. Spatial phase precession through that field might explain any observation of goal-state precession. Therefore, we analyzed whether the neurons that showed goal state precession also showed spatial tuning specifically on trajectories to that same goal. We found that this was only the case for 6/49 cells, suggesting that spatial phase precession could not generally explain our finding of goal-related precession. Furthermore, goal-state precession did not differ in strength depending on whether subjects were near or far from goals (p = 0.37, paired t test), demonstrating that this effect was fairly consistent throughout navigation to the goal. Therefore, it is likely that goal-state precession represents a distinct neural process from spatial phase precession. Overall, because differences in theta power, firing rate, and behavior did not account for our results, our findings indicate that non-spatial phase precession selectively occurs during trajectories to specific goals and may also support the representation of non-spatial, sequential features of behavior.

Section: Discussion

Understanding the nature of the neural code is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Our findings show that neurons in the human brain spike in rhythm with local network oscillations to represent spatial position and non-spatial states, in addition to the well-established code based on firing rate. Specifically, we demonstrate the presence of phase precession in humans performing a virtual spatial memory task. We provide evidence for rodent-like spatial phase precession in human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, in which spatially tuned neurons spike at earlier phases of theta (2–10 Hz) LFP oscillations as subjects moved through the putative place field center. We also provide evidence for the existence of non-spatial, goal-state phase precession, which occurs transiently during trajectories to specific goals. These findings thus extend phase precession beyond rodents and beyond spatial location, highlighting its potential as a more widespread neuronal mechanism for coordinating spike timing during behavior and cognition.
The spatial phase precession we observed in humans bears important similarities to phase precession in rodents. We found spatial phase precession most predominantly in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, where place and grid cells, respectively, are canonically found ( O’Keefe, 1979 74. O’Keefe, J. A review of the hippocampal place cells Prog. Neurobiol. 1979; 13 :419-439 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hafting et al., 2005 32. Hafting, T. ∙ Fyhn, M. ∙ Molden, S. ...

Neurosci. 2013; 16 :1188-1190 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that the spatial phase precession we observed may be driven primarily by place and grid cells, as it is in rodents, although it is possible that our findings of precession were also associated with neurons with more complex spatial firing fields compared to place or grid cells ( Hargreaves et al., 2005 33. Hargreaves, E.L. ∙ Rao, G. ∙ Lee, I. ... Major dissociation between medial and lateral entorhinal input to dorsal hippocampus Science. 2005; 308 :1792-1794 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ; Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011 21. Deshmukh, S.S. ∙ Knierim, J.J. Representation of non-spatial and spatial information in the lateral entorhinal cortex Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2011; 5 :69 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). One key difference between these results and those in rodents is that some spatially tuned neurons in our dataset exhibited activity outside of the firing field, unlike the activity of many rodent place cells where out-of-field spiking is less frequent. This difference in spatial specificity might explain why the tuning of human phase precession is weaker than that observed in many rodent studies and might be due to difference in ethology or physiology between species. Alternatively, a different possible explanation for certain aspects of our results is that phase precession may simply be less precise or prevalent in virtual reality environments ( Aghajan et al., 2015 1. Aghajan, Z.M. ∙ Acharya, L. ∙ Moore, J.J. ... Impaired spatial selectivity and intact phase precession in two-dimensional virtual reality Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :121-128 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are also other distinctive features of our results. Notably, we found a near-significant proportion of positive phase-position correlations (or “procession”), which had very recently been described in rodents ( Wang et al., 2020 109. Wang, M. ∙ Foster, D.J. ∙ Pfeiffer, B.E. Alternating sequences of future and past behavior encoded within hippocampal theta oscillations Science. 2020; 370 :247-250 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, human theta oscillations often appear at a slower and broader range of frequencies compared to those seen in rodents ( Jacobs, 2013 44. Jacobs, J. Hippocampal theta oscillations are slower in humans than in rodents: implications for models of spatial navigation and memory Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2013; 369 :20130304 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Watrous et al., 2013 110. Watrous, A.J. ∙ Lee, D.J. ∙ Izadi, A. ...

Goyal, A. ∙ Miller, J. ∙ Qasim, S.E. ... Functionally distinct high and low theta oscillations in the human hippocampus Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2469 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may explain why phase precession in humans was not previously observed. For this reason, we specifically assessed phase precession relative to the broader range of theta frequency (2–10 Hz) fluctuations of the LFP, in line with the recent discoveries of phase precession in bats ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and marmosets ( Courellis et al., 2019 18. Courellis, H.S. ∙ Nummela, S.U. ∙ Metke, M. ... Spatial encoding in primate hippocampus during free navigation PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000546 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar )—two animals with similarly heterogeneous low-frequency field potentials. As a result of these differences in the properties of phase precession between species, it will be important for future studies to determine whether phase precession plays a different functional role in humans than in rodents.
Our discovery of spatial phase precession bears a potentially interesting relationship to the precession observed relative to non-rhythmic fluctuations in bats ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although many of the electrodes included in this study exhibited (small) spectral peaks, it is possible that non-rhythmic fluctuations in the 2–10-Hz band contributed to the phase estimates in particular epochs, suggesting that human precession shares features with the forms of precession observed in both rodents (relative to oscillatory theta) and bats (relative to non-rhythmic fluctuations). This might hold important mechanistic implications, as only certain models of phase precession are compatible with a non-rhythmic excitatory drive to spatially tuned neurons ( Mehta et al., 2002 63. Mehta, M.R. ∙ Lee, A.K. ∙ Wilson, M.A. Role of experience and oscillations in transforming a rate code into a temporal code Nature. 2002; 417 :741-746 Crossref Scopus (458) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eliav et al., 2018 25.

Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, high-amplitude theta rhythmicity may not be necessary for phase precession at all; recent work in rodents has demonstrated that the theta phase code remains consistent even as theta frequency is altered ( Petersen and Buzsáki, 2020 78. Petersen, P.C. ∙ Buzsáki, G. Cooling of medial septum reveals theta phase lag coordination of hippocampal cell assemblies Neuron. 2020; 107 :731-744.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, rodents continue to show phase precession even when LFP theta power and theta-modulated spiking are reduced ( Royer et al., 2010 86. Royer, S. ∙ Sirota, A. ∙ Patel, J. ... Distinct representations and theta dynamics in dorsal and ventral hippocampus J.

Neurosci. 2015; 18 :1123-1132 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ), and recent evidence has emerged in rodents of slower oscillations like those included in this work (<4 Hz), which may exhibit phase precession ( Safaryan and Mehta, 2020 89. Safaryan, K. ∙ Mehta, M.R. Enhanced hippocampal theta rhythmicity and emergence of eta oscillation in virtual reality bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Schultheiss et al., 2020 91. Schultheiss, N.W. ∙ Schlecht, M. ∙ Jayachandran, M. ... Awake delta and theta-rhythmic hippocampal network modes during intermittent locomotor behaviors in the rat Behav. Neurosci. 2020; 134 :529-546 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is thus likely that the spatial phase precession we observed shares features with the precession observed both in rodents and in bats, despite differences in theta range and rhythmicity. Future experiments carefully manipulating theta power and frequency in rodents while measuring phase precession may be able to further link the precession observed here, and in bats, with that observed in rodents.
Phase precession has predominantly been observed during place- or grid-cell spiking ( Moser et al., 2008 72. Moser, E.I. ∙ Kropff, E. ∙ Moser, M.B. Place cells, grid cells, and the brain’s spatial representation system Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31 :69-89 Crossref Scopus (983) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, recent work has discovered the presence of phase precession relative to sound ( Aronov et al., 2017 2. Aronov, D. ∙ Nevers, R. ∙ Tank, D.W.

Spike train dynamics predicts theta-related phase precession in hippocampal pyramidal cells Nature. 2002; 417 :738-741 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent work also suggests that time cells in the human MTL may exhibit phase precession during verbal memory encoding ( Umbach et al., 2020 105. Umbach, G. ∙ Kantak, P. ∙ Jacobs, J. ... Time cells in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support episodic memory Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :28463-28474 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings highlight the potential generalizability of phase precession to non-spatial domains. In these instances, phase precession may enable the encoding of any successive stimuli or states, with the progression of phases binding a myriad of non-spatial sequences together for learning. By leveraging the idea that any variable may be encoded in spike phase if the frequency of spike rhythmicity exceeds the frequency of the local LFP oscillation ( Mizuseki et al., 2009a 67.

Advantages and detection of phase coding in the absence of rhythmicity Hippocampus. 2020; 30 :745-762 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), we showed that phase precession also occurs with respect to behavioral states other than inhabiting a specific physical location—in this case, exclusively during trajectories to specific goals. The fact that this result is so specific, only showing up for a subset of goals for each neuron, might suggest an ensemble temporal code responsible for encoding all of the goals in the task ( Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015 112.

The goal-state phase precession we observed was largely independent of rate coding for goals, which has been described previously in human studies ( Ekstrom et al., 2003 24.

Neurosci. 2019; 22 :2078-2086 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). The independence of goal-state rate and phase coding is consistent with the observation in rodents that phase precession can appear for specific behavioral states even in the absence of concurrent firing-rate changes ( Robinson et al., 2017 85. Robinson, N.T.M. ∙ Priestley, J.B. ∙ Rueckemann, J.W. ... Medial entorhinal cortex selectively supports temporal coding by hippocampal neurons Neuron. 2017; 94 :677-688.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings support the theory that phase precession is used by the brain to signal behavioral states independent of firing-rate changes ( Huxter et al., 2003 42. Huxter, J. ∙ Burgess, N. ∙ O’Keefe, J. Independent rate and temporal coding in hippocampal pyramidal cells Nature. 2003; 425 :828-832 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ; O’Keefe and Burgess, 2005 75. O’Keefe, J. ∙ Burgess, N. Dual phase and rate coding in hippocampal place cells: theoretical significance and relationship to entorhinal grid cells Hippocampus. 2005; 15 :853-866 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ). A challenge for future work is to understand the specific features of this phenomenon, such as the precise relationship to spatial precession, and the role of different phases within goal-state precession. For example, goal-state precession could involve multiple cycles of phase precession, in contrast to the shorter ranges typically exhibited during spatial phase precession. If so, one hypothesis is that goal-state phase precession represents a novel kind of frequency-code in the brain, where absolute phases do not encode specific stimuli; instead, shifting LFP frequency can modulate spike-time intervals for synaptic plasticity without affecting the spike-phase, consistent with a variety of computational models of phase precession ( Burgess, 2008 9. Burgess, N. Grid cells and theta as oscillatory interference: theory and predictions Hippocampus. 2008; 18 :1157-1174 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bush and Burgess, 2020 12. Bush, D. ∙ Burgess, N. Advantages and detection of phase coding in the absence of rhythmicity Hippocampus. 2020; 30 :745-762 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), and broader cognitive function ( Wutz et al., 2018 113. Wutz, A. ∙ Melcher, D. ∙ Samaha, J. Frequency modulation of neural oscillations according to visual task demands Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :1346-1351 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, spike phases during goal-state precession may help track a person’s “episodic” position within a goal-seeking event. This would align with work in rodents showing phase-precession in “episode” or “time” cells when a rodent runs on a treadmill with a goal ( Pastalkova et al., 2008 77. Pastalkova, E. ∙ Itskov, V. ∙ Amarasingham, A. ... Internally generated cell assembly sequences in the rat hippocampus Science. 2008; 321 :1322-1327 Crossref Scopus (659) PubMed Google Scholar ) but not without a goal ( Hirase et al., 1999 38. Hirase, H. ∙ Czurkó, A. ∙ Csicsvari, J. ... Firing rate and theta-phase coding by hippocampal pyramidal neurons during ‘space clamping’ Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11 :4373-4380 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as evidence from human imaging showing that hippocampal and entorhinal cortex population activity correlates with distance to goal ( Howard et al., 2014 40. Howard, L.R. ∙ Javadi, A.H. ∙ Yu, Y. ... The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex encode the path and Euclidean distances to goals during navigation Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :1331-1340 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, goal-state phase precession may relate to the phase precession observed in ventral striatum “ramp cells” ( van der Meer and Redish, 2011 107. van der Meer, M.A.A. ∙ Redish, A.D. Theta phase precession in rat ventral striatum links place and reward information J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :2843-2854 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), and medial prefrontal cortex neurons in rodents ( Jones and Wilson, 2005 52. Jones, M.W. ∙ Wilson, M.A. Phase precession of medial prefrontal cortical activity relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm Hippocampus. 2005; 15 :867-873 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). The former exhibited precession as rodents approached reward locations, and the latter exhibited precession that was clearest when rodents approached the decision point in a maze ( Jones and Wilson, 2005 52. Jones, M.W. ∙ Wilson, M.A. Phase precession of medial prefrontal cortical activity relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm Hippocampus. 2005; 15 :867-873 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that we found goal-state phase precession across various brain regions, including frontal cortex, together this body of work supports the hypothesis that precession may represent “episodic” position within high-level behavioral states.
It is important to understand the prevalence of phase precession due to its hypothesized relevance as a neuronal mechanism for binding and compressing sequential events. In brief, phase precession organizes spiking at time intervals below the deactivation time constant of NMDA receptors, facilitating synaptic plasticity between neurons that encode events at behavioral timescales ( Greenstein et al., 1988 31. Greenstein, Y.J. ∙ Pavlides, C. ∙ Winson, J. Long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus is preferentially induced at theta rhythm periodicity Brain Res. 1988; 438 :331-334 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Debanne et al., 1995 19.

Synaptic learning rules for sequence learning bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Phase precession may thus be a useful mechanism in the brain for encoding associations between stimuli or events into the relative timing of active neurons for learning and memory. Critically, our findings demonstrate the potential generalizability of such a mechanism, extending phase precession to the human brain and showing that precession does not necessarily depend on specific physiological constraints such as a stationary theta oscillation that consistently stays at the same frequency ( Royer et al., 2010 86.

Bush, D. ∙ Burgess, N. Advantages and detection of phase coding in the absence of rhythmicity Hippocampus. 2020; 30 :745-762 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Demonstrating this generalization of phase precession supports the broader possibility that the instantaneous phase of brain oscillations such as theta may serve as an internal reference “clock” for neuronal spiking (and behavioral states) ( Buzsáki and Tingley, 2018 13. Buzsáki, G. ∙ Tingley, D. Space and time: The hippocampus as a sequence generator Trends Cogn. Sci. 2018; 22 :853-869 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). As the frequency of theta drifts over time, the phase of this signal may become uncorrelated with the progression of clock time in the outside world. Thus, considering oscillation phase as the brain’s internal clock provides new avenues for research into temporal coding mechanisms throughout the brain ( Terada et al., 2017 101. Terada, S. ∙ Sakurai, Y. ∙ Nakahara, H. ... Temporal and rate coding for discrete event sequences in the hippocampus Neuron. 2017; 94 :1248-1262.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tingley et al., 2014 102. Tingley, D. ∙ Alexander, A.S. ∙ Kolbu, S. ... Task-phase-specific dynamics of basal forebrain neuronal ensembles Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2014; 8 :174 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 103. Tingley, D. ∙ Alexander, A.S. ∙ Quinn, L.K. ... Cell assemblies of the basal forebrain J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :2992-3000 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is evidence of this idea in recent literature, such as the recent finding that hippocampal cell assemblies encoding a rodent’s position were more tightly coupled to the phase of ongoing theta oscillations than to absolute time ( Petersen and Buzsáki, 2020 78. Petersen, P.C. ∙ Buzsáki, G. Cooling of medial septum reveals theta phase lag coordination of hippocampal cell assemblies Neuron. 2020; 107 :731-744.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, our findings suggest the potential utility for phase precession in humans, across diverse brain regions, as a general mechanism for the use of temporal coding to represent experiences.
In summary, we have provided evidence for spatial phase precession in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during virtual navigation and shown that it exhibits features similar to those seen in rodents. Further, we also demonstrated the existence of phase precession that is specific to trajectories to particular goals. These findings suggest that phase precession is a general mechanism for temporal coding in the human brain, despite the heterogeneity in theta rhythmicity in human MTL. Furthermore, the discovery of goal-state phase precession extends the potential for phase coding to be physiologically relevant for an array of experiential features, even when the neurons do not show concurrent firing rate changes for those features. Overall, our results suggest that phase precession is an important neural code across species and brain regions, not only for spatial cognition and memory but also for non-spatial features of experience.
Here, we demonstrate the existence of phase precession in humans. However, because our analysis utilized a wider frequency band and less stringent spatial-tuning criteria than studies of rodent phase precession, a challenge for future work is to establish a firm link between rodent and human phase precession. To bridge this gap, future work in rodents may assess whether phase precession occurs in neurons with complex spatial firing fields or out-of-field spiking, and if researchers manipulate the range of theta frequencies to match those in the human brain. Firmly linking rodent and human phase precession would strengthen the idea that precession may hold widespread value as a neural code in the brain across species. Additionally, characterizing precession in animals that have human-like low-frequency brain activity, such as bats and non-human primates, would also strengthen the generalizability of phase precession. Furthermore, our study involved epilepsy patients performing spatial navigation tasks on a computer. It is possible, if unlikely, that the epileptic brain alters patterns such as phase precession. It is also possible that virtual navigation elicits different (i.e., weaker) patterns of phase precession than real-world navigation.

The thirteen participants in our study (10 male, mean age = 3 0 . 2 ± 1 1 . 6 years) were epilepsy patients who had Behnke–Fried microelectrodes ( Fried et al., 1999 27. Fried, I. ∙ Wilson, C.L. ∙ Maidment, N.T. ... Cerebral microdialysis combined with single-neuron and electroencephalographic recording in neurosurgical patients. Technical note J. Neurosurg. 1999; 91 :697-705 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) (Ad-Tech Medical) surgically implanted in the course of clinical seizure mapping at the University of California, Los Angeles. The Medical Institutional Review Board at the University of California-Los Angeles approved this study (IRB 10–000973), and patients provided informed consent to participate in research. For comparison with rodent data we used a publicly available dataset (CRCNS hc-2, hc-3) ( Mizuseki et al., 2009a 67. Mizuseki, K. ∙ Sirota, A. ∙ Pastalkova, E. ...

Multiple single unit recordings from different rat hippocampal and entorhinal regions while the animals were performing multiple behavioral tasks CRCNS. 2013; https://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-3 Google Scholar ).
Microwire signals were recorded at 28–32 kHz, and we used Combinato for spike detection and sorting ( Niediek et al., 2016 73. Niediek, J. ∙ Boström, J. ∙ Elger, C.E. ... Reliable analysis of single-unit recordings from the human brain under noisy conditions: Tracking neurons over hours PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0166598 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Manual sorting identified single- versus multi-unit activity versus noise on the basis of previously determined criteria ( Hill et al., 2011 37. Hill, D.N. ∙ Mehta, S.B. ∙ Kleinfeld, D.

The local field potential (LFP) for each neuron was recorded from the local microelectrodes and was downsampled to 250 Hz for spectral analysis.
This behavioral task is described in several previous studies ( Jacobs et al., 2007 46. Jacobs, J. ∙ Kahana, M.J. ∙ Ekstrom, A.D. ...

Watrous, A.J. ∙ Miller, J. ∙ Qasim, S.E. ... Phase-tuned neuronal firing encodes human contextual representations for navigational goals eLife. 2018; 7 :e32554 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subjects first learned the navigational controls during a 4-delivery training session in a large, wide-open arena. After the practice session, subjects performed the main task, in which they were instructed to drive passengers to one of 6 goal stores in the virtual environment. Upon arrival, on-screen text displayed the name of the next randomly selected destination store. The task was self-paced in order to accommodate patient testing needs. The size of the virtual environment was 1 0 × 1 0 VR units, the width of the road was 2.5 VR units, and the obstructed area in the center of the road was 5 × 5 VR units. During navigation, subjects had a 6 0 ∘ field of view, a maximum forward speed of 1.25 VR units/s, a maximum backward speed was 0.5 VR units/s, and maximum angular velocity of 4 0 ∘ /s. To encourage subjects to take the shortest route to each destination, subjects received 50 points for each successful delivery and had one point deducted for each second that they spent navigating. Points were constantly displayed on-screen. Patients performed an average of 7 3 ± 1 1 deliveries in each session. To assess performance on this task, we measured subjects’ excess path length (EPL) on each trajectory, defined as ratio of the actual path length to the ideal path length. We computed ideal path length on each trial using the A-star search algorithm to identify the most computationally efficient path between goals in the environment ( Russell and Norvig, 2010 87. Russell, S. ∙ Norvig, P. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach Prentice Hall, 2010 Google Scholar ).
All statistical analyses were carried out in Python, primarily using the SciPy ( Virtanen et al., 2020 108. Virtanen, P. ∙ Gommers, R. ∙ Oliphant, T.E. ..., SciPy 1.0 Contributors SciPy 1.0: fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :261-272 Crossref Scopus (3030) PubMed Google Scholar ) and statsmodels ( Seabold and Perktold, 2010 93. Seabold, S. ∙ Perktold, J. Statsmodels: Econometric and statistical modeling with python Proceedings of the 9th Python in Science Conference 2010 https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2010/pdfs/seabold.pdf Crossref Google Scholar ) libraries. For comparisons between two groups, we primarily utilized the Wilcoxon rank-sum test unless otherwise specified. For omnibus testing, we used ANOVAs, determining the p value by comparing the real test-statistic to those from empirically derived null distributions generated by shuffling the true data. All figures were made using the Matplotlib ( Hunter, 2007 41. Hunter, J.D. Matplotlib: A 2d graphics environment Comput. Sci. Eng. 2007; 9 :90-95 Crossref Scopus (9418) Google Scholar ) and Seaborn libraries.
To assess how neuronal activity related to the subject’s virtual spatial location, first, we binned the environment into a 1 0 × 1 0 spatial grid. We computed the firing rate map for each neuron by dividing the number of spikes by the amount of time spent in each spatial bin. We then used an ANOVA to assess whether the interaction of X and Y spatial bin (and thus 2D position) significantly modulated firing rate. To assess the significance of the ANOVA we circularly shuffled the firing rate and generated 500 surrogate test-statistics, and used this null distribution to determine the shuffle-corrected p value of the ANOVA using the real data. These p values were then FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons between the three movement types (CW, CCW, bi-directional). We used an ANOVA to classify spatial-tuning in order to ensure that we captured a wide-range of potentially complex spatial firing fields that might not exhibit high spatial information scores ( Hargreaves et al., 2005 33. Hargreaves, E.L. ∙ Rao, G. ∙ Lee, I. ... Major dissociation between medial and lateral entorhinal input to dorsal hippocampus Science. 2005; 308 :1792-1794 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ; Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011 21. Deshmukh, S.S. ∙ Knierim, J.J. Representation of non-spatial and spatial information in the lateral entorhinal cortex Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2011; 5 :69 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ), though this method showed significant convergence with spatial information metrics ( Figure S3 D). From this ANOVA method, only neurons with critical statistics exceeding 99% of the shuffled data ( 𝑝 < 0 . 0 1 ) were considered to be spatially modulated. We considered spatially-modulated neurons to be analogous to place- and grid- cells because firing rate differed significantly as a function of spatial location. We identified the spatial bin with the highest firing rate (analogous to the center of a place- or grid- field). We only included a spatial bin if the person passed through it at least 3 times, and occupied it for at least 4 s. To assess the significance of spatial information metrics ( Figure S3 D) we generated 500 surrogate spatial information values by randomly re-assigning spikes to positions from the subject’s shuffled trajectories and re-computing spatial information. If a neuron’s spatial information exceeded the 95th percentile of this surrogate distribution, we considered it to have a significantly higher spatial information than chance.
To assess the prevalence and frequency of theta oscillations in the human and rodent LFP, we computed the continuous Morlet wavelet transform (wave number 6) at 20 logarithmically spaced frequencies between 1 and 32 Hz. Then, to identify theta-like oscillations, we utilized an iterative algorithm to subtract the aperiodic background and fit a Gaussian to putative peaks ( Donoghue et al., 2020 22. Donoghue, T. ∙ Haller, M. ∙ Peterson, E.J. ... Parameterizing neural power spectra into periodic and aperiodic components Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23 :1655-1665 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). For this fitting procedure, we restricted the maximum number of peaks to 2, and the maximum peak width to 4 Hz. We only assessed the peak height (parameterized as the height of the Gaussian’s peak relative to the aperiodic background) and the peak frequency (parameterized as the center frequency at which the Gaussian reaches its peak) for the largest peak in the PSD. To assess the prevalence and frequency of theta oscillations in human and rodent spiking, we computed the autocorrelation of spike times, and performed a fast Fourier transform (FFT), yielding the PSD of the spike train.
We estimated the instantaneous phase of LFPs in the theta frequency range. Theta oscillations in human hippocampal formation vary from low (2–5 Hz) to high (5–10 Hz) frequencies ( Watrous et al., 2013 110. Watrous, A.J. ∙ Lee, D.J. ∙ Izadi, A. ...

Functionally distinct high and low theta oscillations in the human hippocampus Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2469 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to analyze fluctuations in the LFP, we estimated 2–10-Hz phase by first identifying peaks, troughs, and midpoints in a broader (30 Hz) lowpass-filtered LFP, and then linearly interpolating between these points with respect to the (2–10 Hz) band-pass filtered signal to estimate phase in the desired frequency range. This phase-interpolation method has been used previously to effectively estimate theta phase in bats ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as in rodents ( Siapas et al., 2005 94.

Cole, S. ∙ Voytek, B. Cycle-by-cycle analysis of neural oscillations J. Neurophysiol. 2019; 122 :849-861 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), as an alternative to using the Hilbert transform. This is because Hilbert phase estimation utilizes narrow band-pass filters that can lead to phase shifts due to the non-sinusoidal characteristics of the LFP signal, whereas the phase-interpolation method initially relies on a wide-band signal to estimate the true peaks and troughs of the signal ( Belluscio et al., 2012 3.

To ensure that phase estimates were not based on an unreliable low amplitude signal, we computed the instantaneous power of the LFP and discarded those time-points in which the power fell below a 25 th percentile threshold ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Low (2-5 Hz) and high (5-10 Hz) theta bouts showed weak but significant correlation in these electrodes (mean 𝜑 = 0 . 1 2 , 𝑝 < 0 . 0 5 ). This indicated that phase estimates could be drawn from across a range of low or high frequencies except during bouts of correlation, when only one band would contribute phases.
To identify phase precession in this dataset, for each spatially modulated cell we first identified every trajectory through the cell’s peak firing location. Following the methods used in some recent studies for measuring phase precession ( Huxter et al., 2008 43. Huxter, J.R. ∙ Senior, T.J. ∙ Allen, K. ... Theta phase-specific codes for two-dimensional position, trajectory and heading in the hippocampus Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11 :587-594 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jeewajee et al., 2013 50. Jeewajee, A. ∙ Barry, C. ∙ Douchamps, V. ... Theta phase precession of grid and place cell firing in open environments Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2013; 369 :20120532 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), for each such trajectory we first identified the spike closest to the center of the bin as the center spike (our reference point for the center of the bin on each trajectory). We limited our analysis to spikes in close spatial proximity to the center of the peak firing bin. To do so, we only analyzed the 11 closest spikes to the center of the peak firing bin. To ensure that these 11 spikes did not occur too distant from the peak firing bin, we set a diameter threshold of 40% of the environmental width, meaning that we did not analyze spikes that occurred further than 2 VR units from the center of the peak firing bin. This diameter threshold could sometimes result in fewer than 11 spikes on trajectories where the neuron was less active. We re-ran our analyses while varying the inclusion criterion for the number of spikes (9, 11, & 13) and the diameter (40% & 60%) and found that the parameters we selected did not significantly affect the proportion of cells exhibiting spatial phase precession ( 𝜒 2 = 5.25, p = 0.5, chi-square test). We next tested for phase precession using circular statistics. Specifically, for each cell we measured the relation between spike phase and the subject’s position by computing the circular–linear correlation coefficient ( Kempter et al., 2012 54. Kempter, R. ∙ Leibold, C. ∙ Buzsáki, G. ... Quantifying circular-linear associations: hippocampal phase precession J. Neurosci. Methods. 2012; 207 :113-124 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). We included all data from the navigation period in our analyses because patients were only stationary for short epochs during each trial (15% of time), and because excluding these epochs did not lead to reduced power in the 2–10-Hz band, or altered prevalence of phase precession.
In order to assess the statistical significance of each neuron’s circular–linear correlation, we used a shuffling procedure that compares the observed phase-position correlation for each neuron to shuffled data from the neuron’s own spike train (thus maintaining the mean firing rate for the neuron) ( Kempter et al., 2012 54. Kempter, R. ∙ Leibold, C. ∙ Buzsáki, G. ... Quantifying circular-linear associations: hippocampal phase precession J. Neurosci. Methods. 2012; 207 :113-124 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate the surrogate distribution, we randomly assigned phases to each spike from the distribution of all the spike phases for that neuron (with replacement), and re-computed the circular–linear correlation 500 times. This null distribution effectively scrambled the relationship between spike position and spike phase and controlled for any effect of spurious phase estimates or differences in sample size. Here, a neuron was considered significant only if the circular–linear correlation computed from the true dataset exceeded the 95 th percentile of the distribution of correlation coefficients computed from shuffled (surrogate) datasets.
We performed two control analyses for alternative explanations for the spatial phase precession we observed. The first analysis tested whether the peak firing bin, our analog to the place-field center, was crucial for observing precession. To do so, we selected control locations for each cell and assessed the strength and prevalence of precession in these control bins. Control bins were chosen as to not overlap with the peak firing bin (at least 30% of the map width away). Similar to the peak firing bin, these control bins had to be traversed a minimum of 3 times with a minimum firing rate of 0.5 Hz. Furthermore, because we only analyzed the 11 spikes in the immediate vicinity of the peak firing bin, control bins matched the peak firing bin in the sample size of spikes per trajectory, ensuring that effects were not confounded by firing rate differences. Another possible alternative explanation for our findings is that the phase precession we observed here is actually encoding relative time to peak firing, independent of spatial position, with particular spike phases occurring at specific time-intervals within any epoch of elevated firing rate ( Ravassard et al., 2013 81. Ravassard, P. ∙ Kees, A. ∙ Willers, B. ... Multisensory control of hippocampal spatiotemporal selectivity Science. 2013; 340 :1342-1346 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ; Aghajan et al., 2015 1. Aghajan, Z.M. ∙ Acharya, L. ∙ Moore, J.J. ... Impaired spatial selectivity and intact phase precession in two-dimensional virtual reality Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :121-128 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ; Umbach et al., 2020 105. Umbach, G. ∙ Kantak, P. ∙ Jacobs, J. ... Time cells in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support episodic memory Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :28463-28474 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). To control for this possibility, we identified epochs of elevated firing rate in the time domain without any information about position, which we refer to as “firing rate motifs” ( Ravassard et al., 2013 81. Ravassard, P. ∙ Kees, A. ∙ Willers, B. ... Multisensory control of hippocampal spatiotemporal selectivity Science. 2013; 340 :1342-1346 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ; Aghajan et al., 2015 1. Aghajan, Z.M. ∙ Acharya, L. ∙ Moore, J.J. ... Impaired spatial selectivity and intact phase precession in two-dimensional virtual reality Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :121-128 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified the spike that occurred closest in time to the peak firing of each motif field, and used the 11 spikes in the immediate temporal vicinity (within 2 s before or after) to compute the circular–linear correlation between spike phase and spike time relative to the motif field peak, matching our spatial phase precession analysis. In both cases, we analyzed the paired difference in correlation coefficients (true versus control precession) for each neuron ( Figure S4 ).
To measure non-spatial phase precession without reference to place fields, we compared the spiking frequency of each neuron to the frequency of the local LFP, with relatively faster rhythmic spiking classified as phase precession ( Geisler et al., 2007 28. Geisler, C. ∙ Robbe, D. ∙ Zugaro, M. ... Hippocampal place cell assemblies are speed-controlled oscillators Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :8149-8154 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mizuseki et al., 2009a 67. Mizuseki, K. ∙ Sirota, A. ∙ Pastalkova, E. ... Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop Neuron. 2009; 64 :267-280 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, detecting oscillations in spike times alone is difficult in humans ( Figure S1 B) and bats ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), potentially due to the transient, non-stationary nature of theta observed in these species ( Watrous et al., 2013 110. Watrous, A.J. ∙ Lee, D.J. ∙ Izadi, A. ... A comparative study of human and rat hippocampal low-frequency oscillations during spatial navigation Hippocampus. 2013; 23 :656-661 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, we applied a method introduced by Mizuseki et al. (2009a) 67. Mizuseki, K. ∙ Sirota, A. ∙ Pastalkova, E. ... Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop Neuron. 2009; 64 :267-280 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar which measures spiking frequency relative to the ongoing LFP. This is a particularly useful method when the ongoing LFP is non-stationary but may still be an important reference “clock” for neuronal spiking. To perform this analysis, we computed the autocorrelation histogram of each neuron based on the timescale determined by the phase of the reference LFP, rather than the conventional method of using absolute time. We computed this autocorrelation using 6 0 ° bins with window-length of 4 cycles ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). For visualization, we fit decaying sine wave functions to the autocorrelation histogram ( Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then computed the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation histogram to yield the power spectral density (PSD) of the frequency of spiking relative to the LFP. Here, a peak relative frequency greater than 1.0 indicates that the cell is oscillating at a faster frequency than the reference LFP. We excluded neurons that exhibited both a peak near 1.0 and significant phase-locking ( 𝑝 < 0 . 0 5 , Rayleigh test) to ensure that we did not mistakenly identify phase-locked neurons ( Jacobs et al., 2007 46. Jacobs, J. ∙ Kahana, M.J. ∙ Ekstrom, A.D. ... Brain oscillations control timing of single-neuron activity in humans J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :3839-3844 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ) as exhibiting phase precession. To measure the strength of this effect we measured the amplitude of the peak in the PSD, normalized by the total amplitude across all other relative frequencies ( Kim et al., 2012 56. Kim, S.M. ∙ Ganguli, S. ∙ Frank, L.M. Spatial information outflow from the hippocampal circuit: distributed spatial coding and phase precession in the subiculum J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :11539-11558 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), which we refer to as the spike-phase “modulation index” (MI) ( Figure 4 A).
In order to ensure that our results did not arise from poor phase estimates due to low LFP amplitude, we discarded spikes that occurred during the lowest 25 th percentile of LFP power in the oscillation of interest ( Kim et al., 2012 56. Kim, S.M. ∙ Ganguli, S. ∙ Frank, L.M. Spatial information outflow from the hippocampal circuit: distributed spatial coding and phase precession in the subiculum J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :11539-11558 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to ensure that low spike counts did not confound our estimates we only analyzed cells with more than 100 valid spike-phase estimates for the autocorrelogram. We compared the spike-phase modulation index to the null distribution of spike-phase modulation indices for the peak frequency, which we computed using randomized phases generated by circularly shifting spike phases within each cycle of theta. This shuffling ensured that across-cycle dynamics (such as precession) were disrupted while maintaining slower and more rapid spiking dynamics ( Kim et al., 2012 56. Kim, S.M. ∙ Ganguli, S. ∙ Frank, L.M. Spatial information outflow from the hippocampal circuit: distributed spatial coding and phase precession in the subiculum J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :11539-11558 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eliav et al., 2018 25. Eliav, T. ∙ Geva-Sagiv, M. ∙ Yartsev, M.M. ... Nonoscillatory phase coding and synchronization in the bat hippocampal formation Cell. 2018; 175 :1119-1130.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The spike-phase modulation index was considered significant if it exceeded the 95 th percentile of this surrogate distribution. Finally, we excluded cells that exhibited significant phase-locking during the entire session (Rayleigh test, 𝑝 < 0 . 0 5 ) in order to ensure that peaks close to 1.0 did not result from phase-locked spiking.
To measure goal-state phase precession, we separately applied our analysis of non-spatial precession to spiking during each of the six goal conditions. We only included neurons for which we observed at least 100 spikes per goal, to ensure a sufficient sample size to analyze non-spatial precession for each goal. We established two tests to characterize significant goal-state phase precession. First, just as with non-spatial precession, the magnitude of detected phase precession (as indicated by a peak in the spike-phase spectra exceeding 1.0) had to be greater than the 95 th percentile of the shuffled distribution. Because we conducted this test for each of the six goals separately, we used the False Discovery Rate procedure ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 4. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Hochberg, Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57 :289-300 Crossref Google Scholar ) to correct the resulting p values for multiple corrections across goals. If a goal exhibited significant non-spatial precession, we then compared the goal-specific modulation index to a surrogate distribution of spike-phase modulation indices generated by selecting 500 random spike-trains from across the entire session. Each null spike-train was generated to match the number of spikes recorded during the significant goal to ensure that firing rate differences did not account for our results. The p value from this procedure compares the magnitude of goal-state precession for the goal in question versus the session as a whole. To test the stability of goal-specific precession, we computed the Pearson’s correlation between the spike–phase spectra of the first and second halves of the session. We then compared this distribution of correlation coefficients to a surrogate distribution that we generated by applying the same procedure to data where the correspondence between the first and second halves of each session was shuffled across cells.
