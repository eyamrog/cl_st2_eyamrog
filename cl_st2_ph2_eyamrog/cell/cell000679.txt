Title: Innate frequency-discrimination hyperacuity in Williams-Beuren syndrome mice


Abstract: Summary

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare disorder caused by hemizygous microdeletion of ∼27 contiguous genes. Despite neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits, individuals with WBS have spared or enhanced musical and auditory abilities, potentially offering an insight into the genetic basis of auditory perception. Here, we report that the mouse models of WBS have innately enhanced frequency-discrimination acuity and improved frequency coding in the auditory cortex (ACx). Chemogenetic rescue showed frequency-discrimination hyperacuity is caused by hyperexcitable interneurons in the ACx. Haploinsufficiency of one WBS gene, Gtf2ird1 , replicated WBS phenotypes by downregulating the neuropeptide receptor VIPR1. VIPR1 is reduced in the ACx of individuals with WBS and in the cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells with the WBS microdeletion. Vipr1 deletion or overexpression in ACx interneurons mimicked or reversed, respectively, the cellular and behavioral phenotypes of WBS mice. Thus, the Gtf2ird1 - Vipr1 mechanism in ACx interneurons may underlie the superior auditory acuity in WBS.

Section: Introduction

The ability to distinguish acoustic frequencies from each other or from the surrounding auditory scene has been essential for survival throughout evolution, and in humans remains fundamental to everyday hearing, linguistics, and musicality ( Feng and Ratnam, 2000 29.

Conversely, poor frequency discrimination may impair language abilities ( Kleindienst and Musiek, 2011 43. Kleindienst, L. ∙ Musiek, F.

However, the neural and genetic mechanisms underlying frequency discrimination are not well understood. To better understand frequency-discrimination acuity, we turned to Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS).
WBS is a neurodevelopmental disorder usually caused by a 1.55- to 1.83-Mb hemizygous microdeletion containing 25–27 contiguous genes in chromosomal locus 7q11.23 ( Bayés et al., 2003 6.

Music and language abilities of persons with WBS are preserved or enhanced, despite developmental delays, intellectual disability (average IQ < 70), and other cognitive and learning deficits ( Bellugi et al., 2000 7.

Those with WBS also have elevated auditory-evoked potentials ( Zarchi et al., 2015 119. Zarchi, O. ∙ Avni, C. ∙ Attias, J. ... Hyperactive auditory processing in Williams syndrome: evidence from auditory evoked potentials Psychophysiology. 2015; 52 :782-789 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ) and atypical activation of cortical areas by sound ( Levitin et al., 2003 57.

Optogenetic activation or inhibition of parvalbumin-positive (PV + ) GABAergic interneurons in the ACx improved or worsened, respectively, behavioral performance that depends on frequency discrimination ( Aizenberg et al., 2015 2.

Here, we sought to examine the mechanistic underpinnings of frequency-discrimination capability in mouse models of WBS (WBS mice) carrying a hemizygous microdeletion spanning Fkbp6– G tf2i equivalent to the human 1.55-Mb WBS locus ( Osborne, 2010 76.

Section: Results

We compared innate frequency-discrimination abilities in 6- to 12-week-old WBS models ( CD +/− mice) ( Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014 97. Segura-Puimedon, M. ∙ Sahún, I. ∙ Velot, E. ...

Genet. 2014; 23 :6481-6494 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A) with wild-type (WT) mice using a pre-pulse inhibition (PPI)-based test of the acoustic startle response (ASR) ( Figure 1 B; Aizenberg and Geffen, 2013 1. Aizenberg, M. ∙ Geffen, M.N. Bidirectional effects of aversive learning on perceptual acuity are mediated by the sensory cortex Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :994-996 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Aizenberg et al., 2015 2. Aizenberg, M. ∙ Mwilambwe-Tshilobo, L. ∙ Briguglio, J.J. ... Bidirectional regulation of innate and learned behaviors that rely on frequency discrimination by cortical inhibitory neurons PLOS Biol. 2015; 13 :e1002308 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Clause et al., 2011 18. Clause, A. ∙ Nguyen, T. ∙ Kandler, K. An acoustic startle-based method of assessing frequency discrimination in mice J. Neurosci. Methods. 2011; 200 :63-67 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). PPI of the ASR is proportional to the frequency difference between background and pre-pulse tones; greater PPI indicates more robust frequency discrimination. In both genotypes, larger frequency shifts caused more PPI, but CD +/− mice exhibited greater PPI at pre-pulse frequencies closer to background ( Figure 1 C). We quantified frequency-discrimination threshold (FDT) using 16.4-kHz background frequency in both genotypes as a measure of frequency-discrimination. FDT in CD +/− mice was ∼50% lower than that in WT mice ( Figure 1 D). Male and female CD +/− mice were equally affected (two-way ANOVA, p genotype = 0.02, p sex = 0.8). Frequency-discrimination hyperacuity (auditory hyperacuity) was not unique to 16.4-kHz background; discrimination was also enhanced at 9.8-kHz background ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Thus, WBS mice discriminate acoustic frequencies better than WT mice.
When we attempted to assess frequency discrimination with an alternative auditory-cued Go/No-go task that required mice learn to pair a tone and reward and discern it from nonrewarded tones, only 1 of 5 CD +/− mice learned the task itself after 2 weeks of training, compared with 7 of 12 WT mice ( Figure S1 C), consistent with known learning deficits in WBS mice ( Li et al., 2009 60. Li, H.H.H. ∙ Roy, M. ∙ Kuscuoglu, U. ... Induced chromosome deletions cause hypersociability and other features of Williams-Beuren syndrome in mice EMBO Mol.

Hippocampal and visuospatial learning defects in mice with a deletion of frizzled 9, a gene in the Williams syndrome deletion interval Development. 2005; 132 :2917-2927 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even if some CD +/− mice proceeded to the auditory-discrimination task, the contribution of learning versus auditory acuity would be equivocal.
ASR alone did not differ between WT and CD +/− mice ( Figure S1 D), suggesting that auditory hyperacuity was not caused by altered startle reflex. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) ( Figure S1 E), which measures initial sound processing (e.g., cochlear transduction, brainstem nuclei responsiveness), did not differ between genotypes. Thus, CD +/− mice have intact peripheral hearing, suggesting that their auditory hyperacuity arises in the central auditory system.
Synaptic interactions in the ACx affect frequency-discrimination acuity in mice ( Aizenberg et al., 2015 2. Aizenberg, M. ∙ Mwilambwe-Tshilobo, L. ∙ Briguglio, J.J. ... Bidirectional regulation of innate and learned behaviors that rely on frequency discrimination by cortical inhibitory neurons PLOS Biol. 2015; 13 :e1002308 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined cellular and circuit properties of neurons in the ACx, the ventral division of the medial geniculate (MGv, auditory thalamus), and connections between the two in acute brain slices from WT and CD +/− mice.
Spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in Layer (L) 4 (thalamorecipient) excitatory neurons in the ACx ( Richardson et al., 2009 86. Richardson, R.J. ∙ Blundon, J.A. ∙ Bayazitov, I.T. ... Connectivity patterns revealed by mapping of active inputs on dendrites of thalamorecipient neurons in the auditory cortex J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :6406-6417 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smith and Populin, 2001 99. Smith, P.H. ∙ Populin, L.C. Fundamental differences between the thalamocortical recipient layers of the cat auditory and visual cortices J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436 :508-519 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) were significantly less frequent in CD +/− mice compared with WT mice ( Figures 1 E–1G). sEPSC frequency was comparable in MGv excitatory (relay) neurons, from each genotype ( Figure S1 F). The sEPSC amplitude was preserved in CD +/− mice in both regions ( Figures 1 H and S1 F). Reduced sEPSC frequency in the CD +/− ACx was not caused by reduced thalamic input. Postsynaptic currents in L4 cortical excitatory neurons elicited by stimulating ascending thalamocortical axons did not differ in amplitude or paired-pulse ratio between WT and CD +/− mice ( Figures S1 G–S1J). It was also not caused by altered intrinsic properties of L4 cortical excitatory neurons ( Figures S2 A–S2I) or of excitatory (relay) neurons in the MGv ( Figures S2 J–S2Q). These results imply abnormality in the ACx local synaptic circuitry.
Reduced sEPSC frequency in the CD +/− ACx was caused by increased cortical inhibition. The difference in sEPSC frequency recorded from ACx excitatory neurons was abolished by the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PTX; Figure 1 G) or voltage-gated Na + -channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX; Figures 1 F and 1G). The EPSC amplitude was not different between genotypes under any condition ( Figure 1 H), indicating that the postsynaptic glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses are unchanged. Thus, decreased sEPSC frequency in CD +/− mice was a consequence of increased inhibition in the ACx circuit.
Consistent with this notion, the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in excitatory neurons in the CD +/− ACx was higher ( Figures 1 I and 1J), but their amplitude did not differ ( Figure 1 K). Thus, in WBS mice, cortical excitatory neurons receive similar direct excitatory inputs but stronger inhibitory inputs, resulting in reduced spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity in the ACx.
To identify the source of elevated inhibition in the ACx of WBS mice, we recorded from fast-spiking (FS) interneurons in auditory TC slices; most FS interneurons are PV + and comprise the major subclass of cortical interneurons ( Scala et al., 2019 91. Scala, F. ∙ Kobak, D. ∙ Shan, S. ... Layer 4 of mouse neocortex differs in cell types and circuit organization between sensory areas Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tremblay et al., 2016 113. Tremblay, R. ∙ Lee, S. ∙ Rudy, B. GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex: from cellular properties to circuits Neuron. 2016; 91 :260-292 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (868) PubMed Google Scholar ). In response to depolarizing current injection, FS interneurons fired more action potentials (APs) in CD +/− than in WT ACx ( Figures 1 L and 1M), as evident at smaller (100 pA) but not larger (250 pA) currents, suggesting that the threshold for eliciting APs (rheobase) was reduced in CD +/− mice. To measure rheobase more precisely, depolarizing current ramps were delivered in the presence of kynurenic acid and PTX to block ionotropic glutamate receptors and GABA receptors, respectively. APs were evoked at lower currents in CD +/− than in WT interneurons, indicating reduced rheobase ( Figures 1 N and 1O). Thus, inhibitory FS interneurons in the WBS ACx are hyperexcitable.
The persistence of hyperexcitability in the presence of synaptic blockers implied that an intrinsic property of FS interneurons accounts for their hyperexcitability. However, the resting membrane potential and input resistance was comparable between genotypes ( Figure 1 O), suggesting that hyperexcitability originated from active properties, such as voltage-dependent conductance. Screens for changes in voltage-gated channels showed no difference between WT and CD +/− FS interneurons in the amplitude of voltage-gated Na + currents, K + currents, or hyperpolarization-activated currents (I h ) ( Figure S3 ). However, when using a protocol to isolate voltage-gated Ca 2+ currents ( Olson et al., 2005 75. Olson, P.A. ∙ Tkatch, T. ∙ Hernandez-Lopez, S. ... G-protein-coupled receptor modulation of striatal CaV1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels is dependent on a Shank-binding domain J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :1050-1062 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ), depolarizing voltage steps delivered to FS interneurons resulted in inward voltage-gated current activated at more hyperpolarized voltages in CD +/− mice than that in WT mice ( Figures 1 P and 1Q). The threshold at which the inward conductance was activated in response to a voltage ramp was ∼2.5 mV lower in CD +/− mice than that in WT mice ( Figures 1 R and 1S), but the total inward current did not differ ( Figure 1 T). The activation voltage of the inward current in CD +/− interneurons was close to the threshold for AP generation; therefore, it may cause the hyperexcitability of ACx interneurons.
If interneuron hyperexcitability underlies frequency-discrimination hyperacuity in CD +/− mice, then decreasing interneuron excitability in the ACx should reverse the phenotype. To reduce ACx interneuron excitability, we used the designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) hM4Di, which hyperpolarizes neurons after activation by Compound 21 (C21) ( Thompson et al., 2018 109. Thompson, K.J. ∙ Khajehali, E. ∙ Bradley, S.J. ... DREADD Agonist 21 is an effective agonist for muscarinic-based DREADDs in vitro and in vivo ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2018; 1 :61-72 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). To express hM4Di in ACx interneurons, we injected recombinant AAVs (rAAVs) that express Cre-dependent hM4Di (rAAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-IRES-mCitrine) into the ACx of Gad2 Cre ; WT mice and Gad2 Cre ;CD + / – mice ( Gad2 , glutamic acid decarboxylase 2), which express Cre recombinase in most interneurons ( Ledri et al., 2014 52. Ledri, M. ∙ Madsen, M.G. ∙ Nikitidou, L. ... Global optogenetic activation of inhibitory interneurons during epileptiform activity J. Neurosci. 2014; 34 :3364-3377 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunochemical validation in Gad2 Cre ;Ai14 mice that expresses tdTomato in a Cre-dependent manner showed colocalization of tdTomato and GABA in cortex ( Figure 2 A); the rAAV injection sites were localized to the ACx ( Figure 2 B). Recording from hM4Di-expressing ACx cells in acute slices confirmed that C21 decreased the number of APs elicited by current injections in cortical FS interneurons ( Figure 2 C).
To determine whether chemogenetic reduction of interneuron excitability reversed frequency-discrimination hyperacuity in WBS mice, we injected vehicle or C21 into Gad2 Cre ; WT or Gad2 Cre ;CD + / − mice that expressed hM4Di in ACx interneurons; ∼30 min later, we tested frequency discrimination using PPI. Several days later, we injected the same animals with the opposite drug (C21 or vehicle) and tested frequency discrimination again ( Figure 2 D). In Gad2 Cre ;CD + / − mice, C21 but not vehicle restored FDT to WT levels; in Gad2 Cre ; WT mice, FDT was unchanged ( Figures 2 E–2G). ASR was unaffected by C21 in either genotype ( Figure 2 H). Thus, hyperexcitability of ACx inhibitory interneurons mediates frequency-discrimination hyperacuity in WBS mice.
To examine how altered ACx circuitry in WBS mice affects frequency encoding, we measured sound-evoked activity in the ACx of awake mice ( Figure 3 A) by performing simultaneous two-photon imaging in hundreds of individual L4 excitatory neurons expressing the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca 2+ indicator GCaMP6f ( Figure 3 B) ( Chen et al., 2013 15.

Several weeks after installing cranial windows, we delivered tones at multiple frequencies and intensities in a pseudo-random order to awake GCaMP6f ExN-L4 ;WT mice and GCaMP6f ExN-L4 ; CD +/− mice and analyzed tone-evoked changes in GCaMP6f fluorescence. We collected data from 7,130 cells in 36 mice ( GCaMP6f ExN-L4 ;WT; 5,726 cells, 30 mice; GCaMP6f ExN-L4 ; CD +/− ; 1,404 cells, 6 mice).

Frequency tuning was heterogeneous in the ACx ( Figure 3 C). Frequency encoding, as it relates to perception, likely involves groups of neurons ( Downer et al., 2021 27. Downer, J.D. ∙ Verhein, J.R. ∙ Rapone, B.C. ... An emergent population code in primary auditory cortex supports selective attention to spectral and temporal sound features J.

See, J.Z. ∙ Atencio, C.A. ∙ Sohal, V.S. ... Coordinated neuronal ensembles in primary auditory cortical columns eLife. 2018; 7 :e35587 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine the ACx’s frequency-coding capacity, we trained linear decoders via machine learning to predict tones and their frequency from the deconvolved Ca 2+ responses of all imaged neurons from each mouse ( Figure 3 E). The linear decoder for tone prediction performed equally in both genotypes ( Figures 3 F and 3G), but a second decoder for frequency prediction was more accurate in CD +/− neurons ( Figures 3 H and 3I), indicating enhanced frequency information present in the activity of CD +/− neurons.
To understand why the frequency decoder was more accurate in CD +/− than that in WT mice, we restricted the analysis window from 400 to 100 ms after tone presentation. Under those conditions, the frequency decoder performed equally well between genotypes ( Figure S4 A), suggesting that later components of the responses in CD +/− mice provide additional frequency information. In fact, sound responses in CD +/− neurons were more sustained ( Figure S4 B), as evidenced by longer temporal autocorrelation range of responses in CD +/− versus WT neurons ( Figure S4 C). To ensure that differences in the total number of cells or the fraction of tone-responsive cells did not affect frequency coding, we randomly selected neuronal populations from WT and CD +/− mice that matched those variables. The improved accuracy persisted in CD +/− mice ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Thus, prolonged temporal components of tone-evoked neural responses in the ACx may enable WBS mice to better encode frequency information, which could underlie frequency-discrimination hyperacuity.
To determine which WBS gene(s) causes the auditory-hyperacuity phenotype of WBS mice, we measured PPI in mice with smaller microdeletions within the WBS-critical region. These mutant mice had either a proximal deletion (PD) spanning Limk1 – Gtf2i or a distal deletion (DD) spanning Trim50 – Limk1 ( Li et al., 2009 60. Li, H.H.H. ∙ Roy, M. ∙ Kuscuoglu, U. ... Induced chromosome deletions cause hypersociability and other features of Williams-Beuren syndrome in mice EMBO Mol. Med. 2009; 1 :50-65 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ) that together encompassed the CD microdeletion ( Figure 4 A). The phenotype of PD +/− mice was like that of CD +/− mice ( Figures 4 B and 4C), but DD +/− mice resembled WT mice ( Figures 4 D and 4E), suggesting that the causal gene(s) for frequency-discrimination hyperacuity is within the PD region. Despite innate auditory hyperacuity, PD +/− mice had deficits in learning an auditory-discrimination task, like those in CD +/− mice. None of the PD +/− mice tested learned the Go/No-go task after 2 weeks of training ( Figure S5 A).

Med. 2003; 5 :311-321 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Gtf2ird1 +/− and Gtf2ird1 −/− mice performed better than WT mice in frequency-discrimination tests ( Figures 4 F, 4G, and S5 B). Conversely, FDT in Gtf2i +/− mice was indistinguishable from WT mice ( Figures 4 H and 4I). ASR was unaffected in the PD +/− , DD +/− , Gtf2ird1 + / − , Gtf2ird1 − / − , or Gtf2i +/− mice ( Figures S5 C–S5F). Thus, hemizygous deletion of Gtf2ird1 causes frequency-discrimination hyperacuity in WBS mouse models.
The putative transcription factor GTF2IRD1 has many gene targets ( Kopp et al., 2020 45. Kopp, N.D. ∙ Nygaard, K.R. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Functions of Gtf2i and Gtf2ird1 in the developing brain: transcription, DNA binding and long-term behavioral consequences Hum. Mol. Genet. 2020; 29 :1498-1519 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) that may influence frequency discrimination. Hyperexcitability of cortical interneurons causes auditory hyperacuity; thus, we isolated those cells from Gtf2ird1 −/− mice and screened for differentially regulated genes using RNA-seq. ( Figure 5 A). RNA-seq analysis revealed several genes differentially expressed in Gtf2ird1 −/− versus WT interneurons ( Figure 5 B). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified transcription factors as the largest group of differentially regulated genes ( Figure S6 A).
One downregulated gene, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 1, Vipr1 , was particularly relevant because CD +/− cortical interneurons have altered voltage-gated current and VIPR1 influences multiple voltage-gated channels ( Gherghina et al., 2017 33. Gherghina, F.L. ∙ Tica, A.A. ∙ Deliu, E. ...

VIP inhibits N-type Ca 2+ channels of sympathetic neurons via a pertussis toxin-insensitive but cholera toxin-sensitive pathway Neuron. 1994; 13 :657-669 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Decreased Vipr1 expression in cortical interneurons isolated from Gad2 Cre ;Ai14;CD + / – mice was confirmed by qPCR analysis, but Vip , the gene that encodes the VIPR1 ligand, was unchanged ( Figure 5 C). Unlike Vipr1 , other genes identified by RNA-seq in Gtf2ird1 −/− mice were either not differentially expressed in CD +/− interneurons or were differentially expressed in the opposite direction ( Figure S6 B). The consistent Vipr1 downregulation and its connection to voltage-gated currents merited further examination of its role in auditory hyperacuity.
To examine whether VIPR1 downregulation occurs in humans with WBS, we obtained postmortem ACx samples from individuals with WBS. VIPR1 levels were lower in WBS brain lysate than control lysate, based on western blot analysis ( Figure 5 D). To examine VIPR1 expression in interneurons, we immunolabeled cortical sections with VIPR1 and the FS interneuron marker PV and quantified VIPR1 in PV + cells; VIPR1 staining was less intense in PV + WBS interneurons than in controls ( Figures 5 E and 5F), but the size and number of PV + neurons were the same ( Figure 5 F).
As an alternative model of human WBS, we used bulk RNA-seq to compare gene expression in cerebral organoids generated from NSUN5 - GTF2IRD2 +/ − hiPSCs with isogenic control hiPSCs ( Figure 5 G). The expression of almost all WBS genes within the NSUN5 - GTF2IRD2 microdeletion was reduced in mutant organoids, suggesting that NSUN5 - GTF2IRD2 +/ − organoids model WBS at the transcriptional level ( Figures 5 H and S6 E). VIPR1 expression was also reduced in NSUN5 - GTF2IRD2 +/ − organoids ( Figures 5 H and S6 E). Per GO enrichment analysis, synaptic genes and biological pathways relevant to neuronal activity, GABAergic neurons, and neurodevelopment were also downregulated in WBS cerebral organoids ( Figure S6 F).
Blocking VIPR1 with the VIPR1-specific antagonist PG 97–269 lowered the AP induction threshold in response to a current ramp in FS interneurons in WT cortex, mimicking the CD +/− phenotype ( Figures 6 A and 6B). In the CD +/− cortex, interneurons were hyperexcitable, and PG 97–269 had no additional effect ( Figures 6 A and 6B). In WT mice, applying PG 97–269 also mimicked the CD +/− voltage-gated channel phenotype, shifting the threshold of inward current activation to more hyperpolarized potentials ( Figures 6 C and 6D). The shift was 2.1 ± 0.4 mV, like the difference between CD +/− and WT interneurons ( Figure 2 D). The shift was smaller in CD +/− interneurons than WT interneurons ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Thus, in WT brain slices, tonic VIPR1 activity limits interneuron excitability; this activity is absent in CD +/− mice, possibly due to decreased VIPR1 levels. The VIPR1-specific agonist [Ala 11,22,28 ]-VIP did not affect WT or CD +/− interneurons (WT [n = 13]: paired t test p = 0.637; CD +/− [n = 11]: paired t test p = 0.727), suggesting that an endogenous VIPR1 ligand is present at high enough concentration to saturate VIPR1. Thus, interneuron hyperexcitability in the WBS ACx may reflect reduced VIPR1 signaling.
Do CD +/− interneurons and Gtf2ird1 +/− interneurons have the same phenotype? FS interneurons in the ACx of Gtf2ird1 +/− mice and Gtf2ird1 −/− mice showed hyperexcitability; their rheobases did not differ from that in CD +/− interneurons ( Figures 6 E and 6F). As in CD +/− mice, PG 97–269 had a small or no effect on the excitability of FS interneurons in the ACx of Gtf2ird1 +/− mice and Gtf2ird1 −/− mice ( Figure 6 G).
The inward voltage-gated current threshold in Gtf2ird1 +/− and Gtf2ird1 −/− cortical interneurons was also shifted compared with WT interneurons and was less sensitive to PG 97–269, like results from CD +/− mice ( Figures 6 H–6J). The PG 97–269 threshold shift was also reduced in Gtf2ird1 +/− and Gtf2ird1 −/− cortical interneurons ( Figure 6 I). The consistency of the cellular phenotypes and PG-97–269 sensitivity between Gtf2ird1 -deficient mice and CD +/− mice supports the notion that Gtf2ird1 regulates ACx interneuron excitability and frequency-discrimination acuity in WBS mice via reduction of VIPR1.
To test if reduced VIPR1 in interneurons underlies frequency-discrimination hyperacuity in WBS mice, we genetically reduced the VIPR1 level in ACx interneurons of WT mice and replenished it in those of CD +/− or Gtf2ird +/− mice.
We generated mice with conditional deletion of Vipr1 only in GAD2 + interneurons ( Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 fl/+ mice) ( Figure S7 A). The Vipr1 transcript decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the cortex of Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 fl/+ mice and Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 fl/fl mice compared with WT ( Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 +/+ ) mice ( Figure S7 B).
Rheobase was reduced in FS interneurons of Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 fl/+ and Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 fl/fl mice compared with that in WT littermates ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 fl/+ and Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 fl/fl mice had normal ASR ( Figure S7 C) but improved frequency discrimination like that of CD +/− mice ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Thus, chronically decreased expression of Vipr1 in interneurons, which is likely representative of WBS, was sufficient to mimic the behavioral and cellular phenotypes of WBS mice.
To determine if Vipr1 depletion in FS interneurons mediates FS interneuron hyperexcitability and frequency-discrimination hyperacuity in WBS mice, we increased Vipr1 expression in those cells using three strategies: • We used rAAVs expressing Vipr1 and GFP under control of human Dlx5/6 enhancer ( hDlx ) ( AAV-hDlx-Vipr1-GFP ), which restricts expression to GABAergic interneurons ( Dimidschstein et al., 2016 24. Dimidschstein, J. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Tremblay, R. ... A viral strategy for targeting and manipulating interneurons across vertebrate species Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19 :1743-1749 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). GFP and tdTomato fluorescence were highly co-localized in GAD2 + cells when AAV-hDlx-Vipr1-GFP was injected into the ACx of Gad2 Cre ;Ai14 mice ( Figure S7 D). After bilateral injection of AAV-hDlx-Vipr1-GFP (or AAV-hDlx-GFP as control) into the ACx, WT interneurons showed no difference in excitability ( Figures 7 E and 7F), but Gtf2ird1 +/− FS interneurons with overexpressed Vipr1 (but not GFP ) showed reduced excitability (increased rheobase) ( Figures 7 E and 7F). No viruses altered the ASR ( Figure S7 E). AAV-hDlx-Vipr1-GFP increased FDT (reducing frequency-discrimination hyperacuity) in Gtf2ird1 +/− mice but not in WT mice; AAV-hDlx-GFP expression alone did not ( Figures 7 G and 7H). Thus, Vipr1 replenishment in ACx interneurons reversed the cellular and frequency-discrimination phenotypes in Gtf2ird1 +/− mice to WT levels. • Using a different viral strategy, we injected rAAVs encoding Cre-dependent Vipr1 ( AAV-CAG-Flex-Vipr1-GFP ) or GFP control ( AAV-CAG-Flex-GFP ) into the ACx of Gad2 Cre mice crossed with CD +/− mice. Overexpressing Vipr1 did not alter GFP + FS interneurons in WT mice ( Figures 7 I and 7J), but in CD +/− mice, it elevated rheobase to WT levels, although FS interneuron hyperexcitability was maintained with control GFP virus ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Viral injection did not altere the ASR ( Figure S7 F), whereas Vipr1 conditional overexpression in interneurons increased FDT in CD +/− mice but not WT mice; GFP expression had not effect ( Figures 7 K and 7L). • We generated transgenic mice with conditional overexpression of Vipr1 in interneurons ( Vipr1 cOE mice) ( Figures S7 G and S7H). Transgenic overexpression of Vipr1 in interneurons did not affect the ASR in WT or CD +/− mice ( Figure S7 I). It also did not alter the rheobase or frequency discrimination in WT mice ( Figures 7 M–7P), but Vipr1 cOE ;CD +/− mice cellularly and behaviorally resembled WT mice. Vipr1 overexpression in CD +/− interneurons reversed the rheobase phenotype in ACx interneurons ( Figures 7 M and 7N) and the frequency-discrimination phenotype ( Figures 7 O and 7P). Thus, reduced Vipr1 expression in ACx interneurons was necessary for the behavioral and cellular phenotypes of WBS mice.

Section: Discussion

Frequency-discrimination hyperacuity may underlie spared or enhanced auditory abilities in persons with WBS. Lenhoff et al. found increased prevalence of absolute pitch in five individuals with WBS who were selected for their musical training ( Lenhoff et al., 2001 55. Lenhoff, H.M. ∙ Perales, O. ∙ Hickok, G. Absolute pitch in Williams syndrome Music Percept. 2001; 18 :491-503 Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar ). Some studies found pitch discrimination (i.e., the ability to distinguish the notes of a musical scale; Plack et al., 2005 79. Plack, C.J. ∙ Oxenham, A. ∙ Fay, R. ... Pitch. Neural Coding and Perception Springer, 2005 Google Scholar ) in individuals with WBS equal to that of control subjects ( Don et al., 1999 26. Don, A.J. ∙ Schellenberg, G.E. ∙ Rourke, B.P. Music and language skills of children with Williams syndrome Child Neuropsychol. 1999; 5 :154-170 Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar ; Levitin, 2005 56. Levitin, D.J. Musical behavior in a neurogenetic developmental disorder: evidence from Williams syndrome Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1060 :325-334 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests a relative strength in this trait given broad cognitive deficits in WBS. However, others found worse pitch discrimination in patients with WBS ( Hopyan et al., 2001 38. Hopyan, T. ∙ Dennis, M. ∙ Weksberg, R. ...

Martínez-Castilla, P. ∙ Sotillo, M. Pitch processing in children with Williams syndrome: relationships between music and prosody skills Brain Sci. 2014; 4 :376-395 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This heterogeneity may reflect the small number of subjects tested, variability in pitch discrimination among individuals ( Mosing et al., 2014 73. Mosing, M.A. ∙ Pedersen, N.L. ∙ Madison, G. ...

Factors affecting pitch discrimination performance in a cohort of extensively phenotyped healthy volunteers Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :16480 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), or differences in testing conditions. That individuals with WBS may not possess increased pitch discrimination does not preclude the fact that they may possess increased frequency discrimination; previous work suggests that pitch and frequency are encoded in different areas of the human ACx ( Bendor and Wang, 2006 8. Bendor, D. ∙ Wang, X. Cortical representations of pitch in monkeys and humans Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16 :391-399 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Auditory information processing in WBS appears atypical based on responses in the brains of persons with WBS measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ( Levitin et al., 2003 57. Levitin, D.J. ∙ Menon, V. ∙ Schmitt, J.E.E. ... Neural correlates of auditory perception in Williams syndrome: an fMRI study Neuroimage. 2003; 18 :74-82 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thornton-Wells et al., 2010 110. Thornton-Wells, T.A. ∙ Cannistraci, C.J. ∙ Anderson, A.W. ... Auditory attraction: activation of visual cortex by music and sound in Williams syndrome Am. J. Intellect. Dev. Disabil. 2010; 115 :172-189 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these studies did not correlate their findings with auditory symptoms. Thus, how abnormal auditory processing contributes to specific WBS symptoms is unclear. Our results suggest that increased inhibition in the ACx affects innate auditory behavior in WBS. Modulation of inhibitory interneuron activity specifically in the ACx via targeted expression of DREADDs reversed the frequency-discrimination hyperacuity phenotype in WBS mice. Replenishing VIPR1 only in FS interneurons in the ACx also reversed the phenotype. Thus, increased cortical inhibition may cause differences in human imaging studies in WBS, although changes in frequency encoding are probably more subtle than would be evident in fMRI. Although this shows the importance of the ACx in frequency discrimination, it does not discount the contribution of other brain areas to the mouse or human auditory phenotypes in WBS.
How interneuron hyperexcitability changes frequency tuning in the ACx is unclear. VIP + interneurons have been linked to cortical disinhibition, i.e., increased activity of VIP + neurons inhibits other interneurons and synaptically increases or prolongs the activity of principal excitatory neurons ( Kullander and Topolnik, 2021 47. Kullander, K. ∙ Topolnik, L. Cortical disinhibitory circuits: cell types, connectivity and function Trends Neurosci. 2021; 44 :643-657 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Longer duration responses of excitatory neurons to a tone in CD +/− mice appeared to improve frequency coding in vivo , which might be a consequence of polysynaptic disinhibitory interactions. In WT animals, the excitability of FS interneurons increased after blocking VIPR1, suggesting that VIPR1s are tonically active due to high levels of ambient VIP or another endogenous VIPR1 agonist (e.g., PACAP) in brain slices. VIP + interneurons are spontaneously active ( Mesik et al., 2015 68. Mesik, L. ∙ Ma, W.P. ∙ Li, L.Y. ... Functional response properties of VIP-expressing inhibitory neurons in mouse visual and auditory cortex Front. Neural Circuits. 2015; 9 :22 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; de Vries et al., 2020 23. de Vries, S.E.J. ∙ Lecoq, J.A. ∙ Buice, M.A. ... A large-scale standardized physiological survey reveals functional organization of the mouse visual cortex Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23 :138-151 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could cause tonic VIP release. Optogenetically increasing VIP + interneuron activity decreases the efficiency of encoding sound information ( Bigelow et al., 2019 10. Bigelow, J. ∙ Morrill, R.J. ∙ Dekloe, J. ... Movement and VIP interneuron activation differentially modulate encoding in mouse auditory cortex eNeuro. 2019; 6 :164-183 Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar ). This may be the inverse of our results, with improved frequency coding by the ACx correlated with decreased VIPR1 activity. Responses of VIP + interneurons also differ across sensory cortices ( Mesik et al., 2015 68. Mesik, L. ∙ Ma, W.P. ∙ Li, L.Y. ... Functional response properties of VIP-expressing inhibitory neurons in mouse visual and auditory cortex Front. Neural Circuits. 2015; 9 :22 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) and varied effects of diminished VIPR1 signaling may add to the heterogeneous cognitive symptoms of WBS. VIP + neurons have mostly been studied as GABAergic interneurons, presumed to signal through postsynaptic GABA receptors. Our results suggest that at least some of their neuromodulatory action is mediated via VIP receptors (e.g., VIPR1) rather than GABA receptors, which could reflect an underappreciated diversity of postsynaptic actions of VIP + interneurons.
The identity of the elevated inward voltage-gated current in WBS interneurons is unclear. VIPR1 signals mainly via G s and protein kinase A activation ( Couvineau and Laburthe, 2012 20. Couvineau, A. ∙ Laburthe, M. VPAC receptors: structure, molecular pharmacology and interaction with accessory proteins Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 166 :42-50 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also via G i/o and protein kinase C ( Cunha-Reis et al., 2017 22. Cunha-Reis, D. ∙ Ribeiro, J.A. ∙ de Almeida, R.F.M. ... VPAC 1 and VPAC 2 receptor activation on GABA release from hippocampal nerve terminals involve several different signalling pathways Br. J. Pharmacol. 2017; 174 :4725-4737 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). VIPR1 regulates multiple types of ion channels, including voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels ( Hayashi et al., 2002 35. Hayashi, K. ∙ Endoh, T. ∙ Shibukawa, Y. ... VIP and PACAP inhibit L-, N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels of parasympathetic neurons in a voltage independent manner Bull. Tokyo Dent.

VPAC1 couples with TRPV4 channel to promote calcium-dependent gastric cancer progression via a novel autocrine mechanism Oncogene. 2019; 38 :3946-3961 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), and others ( Johnson et al., 2019 41. Johnson, G.C. ∙ May, V. ∙ Parsons, R.L. ... Parallel signaling pathways of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) regulate several intrinsic ion channels Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2019; 1455 :105-112 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), any of which could affect neuronal excitability alone or in combination. The voltage-gated inward current activated at more hyperpolarized potentials in CD +/− interneurons may reflect a change in the activation or activity of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, but any other channel that conducts Ba 2+ and is insensitive to TTX and internal Cs + block could mediate the additional current.
The full scope of the WBS phenotype, even in the auditory system, probably involves GTF2IRD1-regulated genes other than Vipr1 . However, the reversal of FS interneuron excitability and frequency discrimination by Vipr1 replenishment only in interneurons of WBS and Gtf2ird1 +/− mice argues that the Gtf2ird1-Vipr1 axis is crucial for these phenotypes. Gtf2ird1 and Vipr1 may have other roles in neurodevelopment, but because pharmacologic and genetic interventions reversed the cellular and behavioral phenotypes in adult WBS mice, auditory hyperacuity is not likely to be caused by irrevocable neurodevelopmental changes.
In summary, we identified the Gtf2id1–Vipr1 pathway in WBS mice that, if diminished, increases the excitability of GABAergic interneurons in the ACx. ACx interneuron hyperexcitability leads to improved innate frequency-discimination capabilities. Since reducing Vipr1 expression in ACx interneurons causes auditory hyperacuity in WBS mice, it is tempting to speculate possible VIPR1-targeting interventions for improving auditory-perceptual acuity in individuals without WBS.
Besides musical fascination and auditory hyperacuity, persons with WBS have hyperacusis. One behavioral proxy for testing sound sensitivity in mice is the ASR test. Reports on ASR in WBS mice are inconsistent ( Li et al., 2009 60. Li, H.H.H. ∙ Roy, M. ∙ Kuscuoglu, U. ... Induced chromosome deletions cause hypersociability and other features of Williams-Beuren syndrome in mice EMBO Mol. Med. 2009; 1 :50-65 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Segura-Puimedon et al., 2014 97. Segura-Puimedon, M. ∙ Sahún, I. ∙ Velot, E. ... Heterozygous deletion of the Williams–Beuren syndrome critical interval in mice recapitulates most features of the human disorder Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23 :6481-6494 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found in the presence of a pure-tone background, WBS mice showed normal ASR across all conditions, but this experimental setting may not be ideal for testing hyperacusis, and more precisely tailored studies are needed.
A VIPR1-selective antagonist, PG 97–269, mimicked the cellular phenotypes of WBS mice in brain slices. PG 97–269 and other VIPR1 targeting drugs are peptides with weak bioavailability and short half-lives, limiting their use to target the brain in vivo ( Latek et al., 2019 50. Latek, D. ∙ Langer, I. ∙ Krzysko, K.A. ... A molecular dynamics study of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 and the basis of its therapeutic antagonism Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20 :4348 Crossref Google Scholar ). VIPR1 is broadly expressed, raising concerns about negative effects of systemic delivery. Developing stable small-molecule agonists and antagonists to manipulate VIPR1 activity in vivo would aid in the study of its role in auditory and other behaviors. Alternatively, identifying downstream signaling components and ion channels by which VIPR1 affects ACx interneurons may identify more accessible pharmacologic targets ( Langer et al., 2022 49. Langer, I. ∙ Jeandriens, J. ∙ Couvineau, A. ... Signal transduction by VIP and PACAP receptors Biomedicines. 2022; 10 :406 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).

Mice (6–12 weeks old) of both sexes were used. Mice were group housed by sex on a 12–hour light:dark cycle. Generation of CD +/– , PD +/– , and DD +/– murine models of WBS ( Li et al., 2009 60.

Haploinsufficiency of Gtf2i, a gene deleted in Williams syndrome, leads to increases in social interactions Autism Res. 2011; 4 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been described previously. Gad2 Cre , PV Cre , Ai14 , Ai93 , CaMKIIα ttA , and Scnn1a Cre mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and maintained on mixed CBA-C57BL/6 background mice. CD +/– , PD +/– , and DD +/– mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice. Gtf2ird1 +/– mice were obtained from the University of Toronto on 129/CO1 background and backcrossed with CBA mice. Gtf2i +/– mice were obtained from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai on C57BL/6J background and backcrossed with CBA mice. Gad2 Cre ;CD, Gad2 Cre ;Ai14;Gtf2ird1 , and Gad2 Cre ;Vipr1 fl/+ mice were, therefore, on mixed CBA-C57BL/6 background. The care and use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
Material from the superior temporal gyrus of eight subjects with WBS (five males, three females; age 17–69 years) and eight age- and sex-matched control subjects was obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank at the University of Maryland. Three fresh-frozen samples each (one male, two females) from the WBS brains and control brains were used for Western blot analysis. Five fixed samples each from the WBS brains and control brains were received, and four from each condition (three males, one female) were of sufficiently good quality to be used for immunohistochemical analysis.
The Vipr1 -cKO mouse model was engineered using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and direct embryo injection. Briefly, prior to embryo injection, chemically modified single-guide (sgRNAs; Synthego) were tested for activity in mouse Neuro2a cells stably expressing Cas9 and assayed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) as previously described ( Sentmanat et al., 2018 98. Sentmanat, M.F. ∙ Peters, S.T. ∙ Florian, C.P. ... A survey of validation strategies for CRISPR-Cas9 editing Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :888 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Resulting NGS data were analyzed using CRIS.py ( Connelly and Pruett-Miller, 2019 19. Connelly, J.P. ∙ Pruett-Miller, S.M. CRIS.py: a versatile and high-throughput analysis program for CRISPR-based genome editing Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :4194 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). For animal model generation, ten 3– to 4–week-old C57BL/6J female mice from JAX were superovulated with 5 units of pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin (PMSG; ProSpec) and 48 h later, with 5 units of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG; Sigma). After overnight mating with C57BL/6J males, the females were euthanized, and oocytes were harvested from the ampullae. The protective cumulus cells were removed using hyaluronidase, and the oocytes were washed and graded for fertilization by observing the presence of two pronuclei. A mixture of the sgRNAs, Cas9, and ssODNs (single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide) consisting of 60 ng/μL Cas9 protein (St. Jude Protein Production Core), 20 ng/μL of each sgRNA, and 5-10 ng/μL of each ssODN (IDT) were injected into the pronucleus of oocytes. The injected oocytes were then returned to culture media (M16 or Advanced-KSOM, both from Millipore) and later the same day transferred to Day 0.5 pseudo-pregnant fosters. Pups were born after 19 days gestation and were sampled at Days 7–10 for genotyping via targeted NGS. Animals positive for both LoxP-site integration events were weaned at Day 21. At 6 weeks of age, they were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice and then bred to homozygosity. Editing construct sequences and relevant primers are listed in Table: Materials for generation of Vipr1-cKO mice.

For the generation of the Vipr1 -OE vector, full-length mVipr1 cDNA was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of a pCAGGs-LSL-IRES-EGFP backbone by using the following primer sets: mVipr1 F (5′-TAGTGGATCCCCCGGATGCGCCCTCCGAGC-3′) and mVipr1 R (5′-CGAGGTTAACGAATTTCAGACCAGGGAGACCTCCGC-3′) and linearized with restriction enzyme PvuI for pronuclear microinjection. Female C57BL/6J mice (3– to 4–weeks-old) were superovulated with gonadotrophin injections 1 and 2 days prior to the experiment; the first 5 units of gonadotrophin were isolated from pregnant mare serum P, then 48 h later, they were injected with 5 units of hCG. Dams were then mated to C57BL/6J males. Fertilized zygotes were collected the following morning in M2 or Advanced-KSOM media, and cumulus cells were stripped from the zygotes with hyaluronidase. The cytoplasm of each zygote was microinjected with 1-5 ng/μL linearized pCAG-LSL-Vipr1-IRES-eGFP DNA diluted in IDTE (a Tris-EDTA buffer at pH 7.5). After being maintained in culture in M16 or Advanced-KSOM media, the injected zygotes were transferred into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant females. At 7–10 days of age, pups were sampled for genotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmation of the genomic insertion of the pCAG-LSL-Vipr1-IRES-eGFP transgene. FISH was performed as follows: purified pCAG-LSL-Vipr1-IRES-eGFP DNA was labeled by nick translation using a red dUTP (AF594, Molecular Probes), and control probes were labeled with a green dUTP (AF488, Molecular Probes). Mouse lung fibroblasts from transgenic mice were grown in culture and harvested by conventional cytogenetic methods as a source of metaphase chromosomes. The labeled transgene probe was first hybridized to transgenic metaphases to identify the site of insertion. A second hybridization using the transgene probe and a chromosome-specific control probe was performed to confirm the identity of the chromosome bearing the transgene insertion. Hybridizations were carried out using a hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran, and 2× saline-sodium citrate buffer (SSC). Fixed slides were denatured in 70% formamide and 2× SSC, at 80 °C. Posthybridization washes were done using 50% formamide and 2× SSC at 37 °C. Slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI, and images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse 80i with a ×100, 1.40-NA Plan Apo objective and CytoVision version 7.7 (Leica Biosystems). CAG-LSL-Vipr1-IRES-GFP mice were crossed with Gad2 Cre mice and then with CD +/– mice resulting in Vipr1 c OE ;CD +/– and Vipr1 c OE ;WT mice.
Frequency-discrimination acuity was assessed via PPI of the ASR and using a hardware–computer interface (SM1000-II; Kinder Scientific), as previously described ( Aizenberg et al., 2015 2. Aizenberg, M. ∙ Mwilambwe-Tshilobo, L. ∙ Briguglio, J.J. ... Bidirectional regulation of innate and learned behaviors that rely on frequency discrimination by cortical inhibitory neurons PLOS Biol. 2015; 13 :e1002308 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ; Blundon et al., 2017 12. Blundon, J.A. ∙ Roy, N.C. ∙ Teubner, B.J.W. ... Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling Science. 2017; 356 :1352-1356 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, a background pure tone (16.4 or 9.8 kHz) was played at a sound pressure level (SPL) of 70 dB throughout the session, unless otherwise noted. Each session was split into four blocks. Block 1 consisted of a 5-min acclimation period in which the background tone was played. Block 2 consisted of nine startle trials in which a 120-dB SPL, 20-ms white noise (WN) burst was played. Block 3 consisted of prepulse trials and 10 startle-only trials in a pseudo-random order. Each pre-pulse trial consisted of a 70-dB SPL 80-ms pre-pulse (pure-tone frequency was 0%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 8%, 16%, or 32% lower than that of the background tone), followed by a 120-dB SPL, 20-ms WN startle pulse, and then returned to the background tone after the startle. Every trial in Block 3 was presented 10 times. Block 4 consisted of three startle trials to identify any habituation over the session. The intertrial interval was 10–20 s, and the startle magnitude was the maximum force exerted immediately after the startle pulse. For all trials,.wav files were created using Audacity 2.1.2 (Audacity, open source). PPI percentage was calculated from Block 3 data as follows: [1 – (pre-pulse trial/average startle only trial)] ∗ 100. Values in Block 2 trials were compared with those in Block 4 as an internal control for startle attenuation over the course of the session. Each animal then had a 3-parameter logistic regression curve fitted to the PPI percentages at each pre-pulse frequency to determine the frequency at which 50% of the total acoustic startle inhibition was achieved, subsequently called the FDT; animals with an r 2 <0.7 were excluded from further analyses. FDT values were then analyzed using a t -test, a one-way ANOVA, or a paired t -test, as appropriate. Pure tone frequencies and sound intensities were calibrated daily by using the sound level meters NL-52 (Rion Co., LTD) and SMSPL Rev B (Kinder Scientific), respectively. In chemogenetic experiments administered on consecutive days, animals were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with DREADD agonist C21 (1 mg/kg in 0.9% saline; Tocris) or vehicle 30 minutes before undergoing the PPI test. Injections were randomized using a within-subject, counterbalanced design to control for treatment order.
We attempted to assess frequency discrimination using an auditory-cued Go/No-go task, based on a previously published protocol ( Froemke et al., 2012 31. Froemke, R.C. ∙ Carcea, I. ∙ Barker, A.J. ... Long-term modification of cortical synapses improves sensory perception Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 16 :79-88 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a modification that required the mouse to initiate each tone presentation. In brief, we food restricted animals to 90%-85% of their body mass and used 10% sucrose solution as a reward. Mice were weighed 3 times/week and given access to ad lib food for 2 hours after each session. Each session was run using an operant chamber (ENV-307W, MedAssociates Inc., St. Albans, VT) enclosed in a sound-attenuating chamber (ENV-022V). The operant chamber was equipped with a nose poke and a food trough with a dipper that was used to present the reward upon successful performance of the task (see below). Each animal was required to progress through two training stages before starting the Go/No-go task. Both training stages and the Go/No-go task sessions last for 1 hour.
Training Stage 1 (food trough training): Each mouse was given a reward (3-s access) for each head entry into the food trough; access was accompanied by the playing of the target tone (8 kHz, 0.5-s duration, at 80-db SPL). To progress to Training Stage 2, mice were required to have 2 consecutive days of receiving at least 20 rewards.
Training Stage 2 (nose poke to initiate trial): To learn trial initiation, mice were required to put their nose into the nose poke hole, after which the target tone played (8 kHz, 0.5-s duration, at 80-db SPL), and the reward receptacle was raised until the mouse received the reward. The mouse was moved to the second part of Training Stage 2 after obtaining 50 rewards. To progress to the Go/No-go task, the mice were required to initiate a trial and obtain the reward within 3 seconds in at least 50 trials, with a successful reward rate of at least 80% for 2 consecutive days. Animals that did not reach this level of performance after 14 days were eliminated from the experiment.
Go/No-go task: When trials were initiated, as in Stage 2, one of five tones was played (2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 kHz, 0.5-s duration, at 80-db SPL) randomly. To receive a reward, the mouse had to enter the reward trough within 3 seconds of the 8-kHz tone playing; entry after other tones did not receive a reward and were punished with a 7-s time-out period, where all lights were turned off and no trials could be initiated. To assess frequency discrimination, the no-go tones were brought closer to the go tone after the mouse achieved greater than 85% accuracy, such that the second phase was 4, 6, 8, 12, or 16 kHz with the tones of each subsequent phase getting closer to the go tone in the same pattern.
ABR experiments were performed as previously described ( Chun et al., 2017 17. Chun, S. ∙ Du, F. ∙ Westmoreland, J.J. ...

USA. 2014; 111 :16919-16924 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with Avertin (0.6 mg/g bodyweight, i.p.), and ABR was measured using a Tucker Davis Technology (TDT) System III with RZ6 Multiprocessor and BioSigRZ software. Sounds were delivered via the MF-1 speaker in the open-field configuration. ABR waveforms were recorded using subdermal needles placed at the vertex of the skull, below the pinna of the ear, and at the base of the tail. The needles were connected to a low-impedance head stage (RA4LI, TDT) and fed into the RZ6 multiprocessor through a preamplifier (RA4PA, Gain 20×, TDT). ABR waveforms were averaged from 500 presentations of a tone (21 tones/s) in the alternating phase and were band-pass filtered (300 Hz-3 kHz). The ABR threshold was defined as the minimum sound intensity that elicited a wave above the noise level. All ABR experiments were conducted in a sound booth (Industrial Acoustic Company, IAC, Model 120A double wall).
Acute primary TC slices (400-μm thick) containing the left ACx and the left ventral part of the MGv of the thalamus were prepared as previously described mice ( Bayazitov et al., 2013 5.

Briefly, mouse brains were removed and placed in cold (4 °C) dissecting media containing (in mM) 125 choline-Cl, 2.5 KCl, 0.4 CaCl 2 , 6 MgCl 2 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , and 20 glucose (300–310 mOsm), equilibrated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . TC slices were obtained from the left hemisphere by using a slicing angle of 15° to horizontal. Slices were transferred to ACSF containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 20 glucose (300–310 mOsm), equilibrated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 at 34 °C for 30 min followed by 1 h at room temperature prior to use. Slices were transferred to a recording chamber mounted on an upright microscope (Olympus) and superfused (∼2 mL/min) with warm (30-32 °C) ACSF. Slices were viewed with a CCD camera (Rolera-XR, QImaging) using IR-DIC optics. Thalamorecipient pyramidal neurons in L4 (∼ 300 μm from the pia) were identified by soma shape and size and by a large visible apical dendrite projecting toward the pia. If recorded in current-clamp mode, pyramidal neurons were additionally verified as regularly spiking. FS interneurons were identified as having nonpyramidal shape and multipolar dendritic projections from the soma. The FS phenotype was verified by recording in current-clamp mode. Mice with tdTomato genetically expressed in PV + cells ( PV Cre ;Ai14;CD +/– and PV Cre ;Ai14;WT ) were used in a subset of experiments in which fluorescently labelled soma were targeted using the microscope’s epifluorescence.
Whole-cell recordings were made with patch pipettes (3-5 MOhm) using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, digitized (10 kHz) with a Digidata 1440, and recorded using pCLAMP 10 software (all Molecular Devices). In all experiments, membrane potentials were corrected for a liquid junction potential of –10 mV. In voltage-clamp recordings, series resistance, input resistance, and holding current were monitored for stability. During current-clamp recordings, pipette capacitance and series resistance were compensated using the amplifier’s circuits. Input resistance and membrane-resting voltage were monitored during recordings. Cells with series resistance greater than 40 MOhms in voltage-clamp recordings and 30 MOhms in current-clamp recordings or cells that changed resistance values more than 20% over the duration of recordings were rejected. Drugs were added to ACSF or locally applied via continuous pressure ejection from a large-diameter pipette placed in the slice near the recorded cell. Pressure ejection of control ACSF caused no detectable effect on neurons.
For standard voltage-clamp recordings, patch pipettes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM) 125 CsMeSO 3 , 2 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 4 ATP-Mg 2 , 0.3 GTP-Na, 10 creatine phosphate-Na 2 , 5 QX-314, and 5 TEA-Cl (pH 7.4, 290-295 mOsm). For current-clamp recordings, internal solution contained (in mM) 115 potassium gluconate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 MgCl 2 , 0.1 EGTA, 4 ATP-Mg 2 , 0.4 GTP-Na, and 10 creatine phosphate-Na 2 (pH7.4, 290-295 mOsm). For voltage-clamp recording of voltage-gated Ca 2+ currents, external CaCl 2 was replaced with 3 mM BaCl 2 , 0.5 μM TTX was included in the ACSF, and EGTA and QX-314 were omitted from the internal solution. For voltage clamp I-V curves, cells were hyperpolarized to –90 mV followed by steps of increasing depolarization amplitude (duration as indicated in text/figures). Current intensity was corrected for linear leak current, as determined from a brief –5-mV step from rest. Na + and Ca 2+ current density was quantified as the peak inward current divided by the membrane capacitance. K + current density was quantified as the steady-state outward current divided by the membrane capacitance. The I h density was determined by delivering 2-s hyperpolarizing pulses from rest and measuring the inward current “sag” divided by the membrane capacitance. To determine the Ca 2+ current threshold, 1-s ramps from –90 to +30 mV were delivered. Responses were leak-subtracted, and the threshold was quantified as the peak of the second derivative of the current signal.
Spontaneous synaptic inputs were recorded with neurons held at –70 mV for excitatory postsynaptic potentials (with or without inhibitory inputs blocked by 100 μM PTX, as indicated) and 0 mV for inhibitory synaptic inputs (with or without excitatory inputs blocked with 3 mM kynurenic acid as indicated). For miniature synaptic events, 0.5 μM TTX was included in the ACSF. Spontaneous activity was recorded for 5-10 min beginning at least 2 min after whole-cell break-in. EPSCs were automatically detected using miniAnalysis (Synaptosoft) as deviations of more than 5× the baseline root mean squared noise level.
Current clamp input–output curves were obtained by delivering 1-s current pulses of increasing amplitude. Rheobase was determined by delivering a current ramp at 300 pA/s and measuring the current intensity that elicited the first spike. Input resistance was calculated either from a small hyperpolarizing test pulse or from the slope of the initial linear response to the ramp. Individual spike properties (threshold, after-hyperpolarization potential [AHP], half-width, etc.) were measured using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft). Threshold was determined as the peak of the second differential of the voltage signal. AHP was determined as the negative peak voltage relative to the threshold.
To generate TC input–output curves, TC postsynaptic currents (PSCs) were evoked by current pulses (intensity 0.1-1 mA, duration, 100 μs) delivered to the thalamic radiation via tungsten concentric bipolar electrodes (FHC) using a stimulus isolator (Iso-flex; A.M.P.I.). Monosynaptic EPSC amplitude was quantified as the initial slope of the inward current response.
Coding sequences of the mVipr1 (Genbank Accession number: NM_011703.4) were amplified with primers, Vipr1 F (5ʹ-CTTAAGAAAGGTCGACCACCATGCGCCCTCCGAGCCT-3ʹ) and Vipr1 R (5ʹ-TGCCCTCTCCGGATCCGACCAGGGAGACCTCCGC-3ʹ) from cDNA, generated from reverse-transcribed mouse whole-brain RNA using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen), inserted into pAAV-hDLX-T2A-eGFP vector plasmid (modified from Addgene plasmid 83895) by infusion cloning (638933, Takara Bio Inc.).
The protein-coding sequence of tdTomato was PCR-amplified from pGP-AAV-CAG-FLEX-jGCaMP7s-WPRE (Addgene 104495) by using two PCR primers, tdTomato F (5ʹ-CTTAAGAAAGGTCGACCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3ʹ) and tdTomato R (5ʹ-CCGCTATCACAGATCACTAGTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCC-3ʹ) and replaced the eGFP-coding sequence of pAAV-hDLX-VIPR1-T2A-EGFP by infusion cloning. The pAAV-hDlx-Flex-GFP-Fishell_6 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Gordon Fishell’s lab (Addgene plasmid # 83895). The pAAV-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine was a gift from Bryan Roth (Addgene plasmid # 50455; RRID:Addgene_50455)
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane (in pure oxygen). Under aseptic conditions, a midline incision was made in the scalp. Virus was injected bilaterally into the primary ACx (250 nL per site at a rate of 30 nL/min; coordinates: 2.2 mm caudal to bregma, 0.3 mm medial to the dorsal insertion of the temporalis muscle onto the skull, and injection depth 0.8 mm).
We used this method in GCaMP6f ExN-L4 ;WT and GCaMP6f ExN-L4 ; CD +/– mice as previously described ( Blundon et al., 2017 12. Blundon, J.A. ∙ Roy, N.C. ∙ Teubner, B.J.W. ... Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling Science. 2017; 356 :1352-1356 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). To selectively express GCaMP6f in L4 excitatory neurons, we crossed Ai93 mice ( TIGRE-Ins-TRE-LSL-GCaMP6f ) ( Madisen et al., 2015 61. Madisen, L. ∙ Garner, A.R. ∙ Shimaoka, D. ... Transgenic mice for intersectional targeting of neural sensors and effectors with high specificity and performance Neuron. 2015; 85 :942-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (607) PubMed Google Scholar ) with CamKIIα tTA mice (excitatory neurons specificity) and with Scnn1a Cre mice (L4 specificity). We refer to the resultant transgenic mice as GCaMP6f ExN-L4 mice. We then crossed those mice with CD +/– mice.
Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg body weight) and subsequent injections of 50 mg/kg ketamine. Under aseptic conditions, a 2- to 3-g stainless steel headpost was fixed to three miniature screws in the skull and cemented into place with dental cement. Using the headpost to secure the animal’s head, the lateral temporalis muscle was removed to reveal the skull overlying the ACx. A craniotomy was made using a 1.5-mm biopsy punch, and a plastic well was cemented around the craniotomy to hold saline. The overlying dura was carefully removed, and a 3-mm glass coverslip was cemented over the cranial window. To reduce postoperative pain, decrease inflammation, and eliminate infection, each mouse was given subcutaneous injections of meloxicam (2 mg/kg), Baytril (5 mg/kg), dexamethasone (2 mg/kg), and amoxicillin (0.3 mg/mL) in the drinking water. The animals received this postoperative care for the duration of the experiments.
After recovery, mice were acclimated to the head-fixed setup. For at least 3 days prior to imaging, the animal was stabilized on a rotating disc under the two-photon microscope while the head was secured in place with the headpost. Acclimation began with 15-min intervals and progressed to 1-h intervals. During acclimation and imaging, animals were in the dark, surrounded by a sound-attenuating chamber. To determine differences in spontaneous firing patterns between genotypes and sound-evoked firing patterns, animals were imaged during 30 min of silence and 30 min of sound delivery. GCaMP6f fluorescence in L4 neurons located 300-400 μm beneath the pial surface was monitored with the Olympus multiphoton imaging system (FVMPE-RS, FluoView FV1000) and an Insight tunable femtosecond-pulsed laser unit (Spectra-Physics). Neurons expressing GCaMP6f were imaged with a 25× water immersion objective (NA 1.05, Olympus XPlan N) using an excitation wavelength of 930 nm with a resonant scanner at a rate of 10 frames/s with a field of view of 512 μm × 512 μm. Tones were generated with OpenEx software and an RZ6 signal processor (TDT) with 100-MHz processing speed and delivered through a free-field electrostatic speaker placed 10 cm from the contralateral ear of the animal. During sound-delivery experiments, the sound-stimulation software triggered the start of the microscope-scanning software. GCaMP6f fluorescence was measured in response to pure tones, with frequencies ranging from 4.8 to 29.4 kHz, intensities of 10- to 70-dB SPL (60- to 0-dB attenuation, respectively), and duration of 50 ms played at 1 Hz in pseudo-random order. Cells were included in the analysis if they were in focus during both the sound and silent conditions.
Videos were corrected for movement artifacts with a custom Matlab routine. Each frame was aligned to a stable reference frame using a nonrigid image-registration algorithm, as previously described ( Blundon et al., 2017 12. Blundon, J.A. ∙ Roy, N.C. ∙ Teubner, B.J.W. ... Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling Science. 2017; 356 :1352-1356 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rueckert et al., 1999 89. Rueckert, D. ∙ Sonoda, L.I. ∙ Hayes, C. ... Nonrigid registration using free-form deformations: application to breast MR images IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging. 1999; 18 :712-721 Crossref Scopus (4167) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following stabilization, video segments with excessive movement artifacts were pruned from the video sequence by using a custom Matlab code. For automatic cell identification, a custom Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 92. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (30895) PubMed Google Scholar ) macro was developed that first involved image background subtraction followed by image down-sampling. To identify regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to active cell soma, we used the Ilastik software package ( Berg et al., 2019 9. Berg, S. ∙ Kutra, D. ∙ Kroeger, T. ... ilastik: interactive machine learning for (bio)image analysis Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1226-1232 Crossref Scopus (813) PubMed Google Scholar ) to train a classifier to segment all cell bodies, frame by frame, that had calcium intensities above the local background. The background levels were estimated by the classifier by the paired manual annotations from inside and outside cell bodies. We used a background-subtracted image as an input for the cell segmentation. We used a temporal moving median filter with a 10-s window to remove the background intensity for all pixels in the 512 × 512 time-lapse image. We used the ROIs defined by the segmented cell bodies in each frame to calculate the mean intensity of the calcium signal. The mean fluorescence intensity and the frame number, location, and area of the ROIs of the image sequence were stored in comma-separated value (CSV) files.
Fluorescence signals from active cell soma were normalized to the baseline, and ΔF/F of the peak amplitudes was calculated as the change in fluorescence over baseline fluorescence levels × 100%. We calculated the ΔF/F image by using the following equation: 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐹 𝐹 = 𝐹 − 𝐹 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 𝐹 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ,
where F was the raw calcium signal image, and F mean was the corresponding temporal moving mean filter with a 10-s window.
We next assigned cell ID numbers to active cell soma by using a custom R script. The XY coordinates of the active soma detected in the entire recording of a cell were typically clustered within a few pixels. The spread of the coordinates of the centers depended on the degree-of-motion artifact. We used hierarchical clustering of the XY coordinates to identify individual cells. We adjusted the hierarchical tree-cut height parameter to minimize over-segmentation (multiple cell IDs assigned to one biological cell) and under-segmentation (single-cell ID assigned to multiple biological cells).
We used the OASIS software package ( Friedrich et al., 2017 30. Friedrich, J. ∙ Zhou, P. ∙ Paninski, L. Fast online deconvolution of calcium imaging data PLOS Comput. Biol. 2017; 13 :e1005423 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to deconvolve raw calcium ΔF/F traces. We used 45 ms as the rise time and 142 ms as the decay time parameters ( Chen et al., 2013 15. Chen, T.W. ∙ Wardill, T.J. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity Nature. 2013; 499 :295-300 Crossref Scopus (3674) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used all the local maxima of the deconvolved trace as cell-firing events.
To analyze the differences in sound discrimination based on L4 excitatory activity, we constructed a linear frequency and cue decoder based on the deconvolved calcium traces, inspired by the linear decoder ( Kingsbury et al., 2020 42. Kingsbury, L. ∙ Huang, S. ∙ Raam, T. ... Cortical representations of conspecific sex shape social behavior Neuron. 2020; 107 :941-953.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Deconvolved traces were z-scored. To reduce the dimensionality of the training data, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, and the top 20 principal components (PCs) were extracted. A logistic-regression model that includes the projections onto the PCs as input was used. For the frequency decoder, the model was trained to predict the frequency of the cue that was most recently presented. Unless otherwise noted, this was trained on and applied to only the cue frame and the four frames after the cue (extending 400 ms after tone presentation). The sound–no sound decoder was trained to predict whether a frame was a cue frame or not. For this decoder, only cue frames and the five frames preceding a cue frame were used. Five-fold cross-validation was used to estimate the decoder performance as follows: data were divided into five blocks and from these blocks, five train/validation splits were constructed, where each split used one block for validation and the remaining four blocks for training. Mean validation accuracies over all splits were reported in the text. To avoid leakage, splits were contiguous periods of the entire recording and were performed such that no individual cue-presentation period was split between train and validation.
To determine what factors most contributed to the significant difference in frequency discrimination between WT and WBS, we performed the same decoder analysis using modifications or subsets of the original data described above. First, to investigate if the difference in discriminability was the result of different numbers of cells being reliably imaged and analyzed in WBS vs WT, we balanced the data sets such that the input to the decoder for all recordings was a set of 50 randomly selected cells of the entire population. Second, to investigate if the difference in discriminability was a result of different proportions of sound-responsive cells in WBS vs WT, we matched these proportions in the following way: a cell was considered sound responsive if its mean deconvolved signal at cue frames was more than 1.96 standard errors above its mean baseline level (mean activity over the five pre-cue frames). For each recording, cells were randomly selected, such that 20% were sound-responsive. Finally, to investigate if the difference in discriminability was a result of the choice of frames over which the decoding was performed, we repeated the frequency-decoding analysis using only the cue frame and the frame immediately after it (100 ms after tone presentation). This decoder analysis was performed with custom code in python using the scikit-learn package ( Pedregosa et al., 2011 77. Pedregosa, F. ∙ Varoquaux, G. ∙ Gramfort, A. ... Scikit-learn: machine learning in python J. Mach. Learn. Res. 2011; 12 :2825-2830 Crossref Google Scholar ).
To isolate interneurons, we generated Gtf2ird1 –/– mice that express tdTomato under control of the interneuron-selective Gad2 promoter ( Gad2 Cre ;Ai14;Gtf2ird1 – / – mice) and sorted tdTomato + cells from the cortex of Gad2 Cre ;Ai14;Gtf2ird1 +/+ and Gad2 Cre ;Ai14;Gtf2ird1 – / – mice. Mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation and decapitated. The cortex was isolated and washed with cold Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (LK003188, Worthington Biochemical Company) and then placed in plain neurobasal medium (21103049, Thermo). The tissue was dissociated with activated papain (LK003178, Worthington Biochemical Company) and DNAse I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C. Then it was triturated by repeated gentle pipetting with a 2-mL glass pipette. Tissue digestion was stopped by adding reconstituted BSA-ovalbumin solution (LK003182, Worthington Biochemical Company). The resulting single-cell suspension was filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD 352350), centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature, washed once, and resuspended with cold Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution. The single-cell suspension was then FACS-sorted by an Aria Fusion cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with blue (488 nm), yellow/green (561 nm), red (640 nm), and violet (405 nm) lasers to isolate tdTomato + cells. A 100-μm nozzle was used for sorting, and BD FACS Diva Software (BD Biosciences) was used for data acquisition and analysis.
Total RNA was isolated from brain tissue or organoids by using mirVana RNA isolation kit (ThermoFisher), quantified using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA assay (ThermoFisher), and quality checked by the 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Nano assay (Agilent) or 4200 TapeStation High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape assay (Agilent) prior to library generation. Libraries were prepared from total RNA with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, PN 20020599). Libraries were analyzed for insert-size distribution using the 2100 BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity kit (Agilent), 4200 TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape assay (Agilent), or 5300 Fragment Analyzer NGS fragment kit (Agilent). Libraries were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen ds DNA assay (ThermoFisher) or by low-pass sequencing with a MiSeq nano kit (Illumina). Paired-end 100-cycle sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina).
Total stranded RNA-seq data were processed by the internal AutoMapper pipeline. Briefly, the raw reads were first trimmed (Trim-Galore version 0.60), then mapped to the human genome assembly GRCh38 (STAR v2.7; Dobin et al., 2013 25. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The gene-level values were then quantified (RSEM v1.31; Li and Dewey, 2011 59. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinform. 2011; 12 :1-16 Crossref Scopus (11030) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on GENCODE annotation (v31). Low-count genes were removed from the analysis by using a CPM cutoff corresponding to a count of 10 reads and only confidently annotated (levels 1 and 2 gene annotation), and protein-coding genes were used for differential-expression analysis. Normalization factors were generated using the TMM method ( Robinson and Oshlack, 2010 87. Robinson, M.D. ∙ Oshlack, A. A scaling normalization method for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data Genome Biol. 2010; 11 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ); counts were normalized using voom ( Law et al., 2014 51. Law, C.W. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Shi, W. ... voom: precision weights unlock linear model analysis tools for RNA-seq read counts Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :1-17 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ); and normalized counts were analyzed using the lmFit and eBayes functions (R limma package version 3.42.2; Smyth, 2005 101. Smyth, G.K. limma: linear Models for microarray Data Gentleman, R. ∙ Carey, V.J. ∙ Huber, W. ... (Editors) Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Solutions Using R and Bioconductor Springer, 2005; 397-420 Crossref Google Scholar ). The significantly up- and downregulated genes were defined by an adjusted p-value <0.05.
GO enrichment analysis was performed as previously described ( Reimand et al., 2019 84. Reimand, J. ∙ Isserlin, R. ∙ Voisin, V. ... Pathway enrichment analysis and visualization of omics data using g:Profiler, GSEA, cytoscape and EnrichmentMap Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14 :482-517 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, differentially expressed mRNAs (FDR <0.05) were ranked by p-value. Enrichment analysis was performed using g:Profiler (version e105_eg52_p16_e84549f) ( Raudvere et al., 2019 83. Raudvere, U. ∙ Kolberg, L. ∙ Kuzmin, I. ... g:profiler: a web server for functional enrichment analysis and conversions of gene lists (2019 update) Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W191-W198 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a custom background gene list consisting of all mRNAs detected (> 10 counts) in each sequencing experiment. Enriched GO terms relevant to neurobiology were selected for graphing. Dot plots were prepared in R using ggplot2.
Total RNA was isolated from the tissue or cells with Aurum Total RNA Mini kit (7326820, Bio-Rad). The iScript kit (1708840, Bio-Rad) was used to synthesize cDNA from the isolated total RNA and the quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green (4309155, Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Primers (Table: qPCR primers) were designed using Beacon Designer (Premier Biosoft), and the specificity of each primer pair was manually verified using ClustalOmega (EMBL). Absence of primer-dimers and contamination with genomic DNA was verified with melting curves for each run. Expression levels of all genes were normalized to GAPDH or U6 for each biological replicate. Samples from each mouse were run in two or three technical replicates.

Brain tissue was resuspended with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors and sonicated twice at 15% amplitude for 10 s in the sonifier (Bronson) on ice. Supernatant was collected from total-protein lysate by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After quantification of the supernatant fraction by BCA assay (23225, ThermoFisher), 10 mg of the protein sample was fractionated using the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (88518, ThermoFisher). After incubation with 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mM Tris. pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% (vol/vol) Tween 20) for 30 min, membranes were incubated with anti-VIPR1 (1:250 dilution; PA3-113, ThermoFisher) or anti-ACTB (actin) (1:5,000 dilution; A5316, Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were washed for 5 min three times and incubated with a 1:3,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (SC-2054 or SC-2005, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were washed with TBST three times and developed using the ECL system (34075, Pierce Biotechnology Inc.).
Mice were deeply anesthetized and intracardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and brains were fixed overnight. Each brain was sliced (50 μm) coronally with a vibratome (Leica). The brain sections were preincubated in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0) at 80 °C for 20 min, cooled to room temperature, and washed in 1× PBS for 20 min twice. Sections were incubated in PBS-blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 3% BSA, 0.2% Triton X100, in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the following primary antibodies: VIPR1 (1:250, PA3-113, Invitrogen), parvalbumin (PV) (1:5000, PV235, Swant), GFP (1:1000, ab13970, Abcam), GABA (1:1000, A2052, Sigma Aldrich) for 48 h at 4 °C. Appropriate Alexa dye–conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to detect primary antibody binding for 48 h at 4 °C. DAPI (Invitrogen) was used as the nuclear counterstain. Images of immunostained postmortem human brain sections were quantified using Fiji (ImageJ). PV-stained sections were thresholded and used to automatically generate ROIs around PV + cell bodies. Average pixel intensity of VIPR1 staining of the same slices was quantified within those ROIs.
The NSUN5–GTF2IRD2 heterozygous microdeletion was introduced into TP-190a hiPSC clones by using the CRISPR/Cas9 method. Three TP-190a hiPSC clones were obtained by reprogramming dental pulp stem cells from a healthy male (ALSTEM) by using episomal plasmids. All three clones expressed pluripotency markers, had a normal karyotype (G-Banding and SNP Microarray), and displayed high neural differentiation potential. One clone (#2) was selected for differentiation experiments. TP190a hiPSCs were pretreated with StemFlex (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1× RevitaCell (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h. Then, approximately 2×10 6 cells were transiently co-transfected with precomplexed ribonuclear proteins consisting of 150 pmol of each chemically modified sgRNA, 100 pmol Sp Cas9 protein (St. Jude Protein Production Core), and 500 ng pMaxGFP (Lonza). The transfection was performed via nucleofection (Lonza, 4D-Nucleofector™ X-unit) using solution P3 and program CA-137 in a large (100 μL) cuvette according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. At 12 days posttransfection, cells were sorted based on viability and plated onto Vitronectin XF (Stem Cell Technologies)–coated plates into prewarmed (37 °C) StemFlex media supplemented with 1× CloneR (Stem Cell Technologies). Clones were expanded, screened, and verified for the desired deletion via Sanger sequencing. Zygosity was confirmed using 5ʹ, 3ʹ, and internal primers. Editing construct sequences and relevant primers are listed in Table: Materials for generating an isogenic WBS microdeletion in hiPSCs. Of note, the CAGE865.GTF2IRD2.g3 sgRNA was designed to a unique sequence in the TP190a genome that differs from the reference genome.

The control hiPSC line TP-190a and the isogenic microdeletion line TP-190a-NSUN-GTF2IRD2-DEL clone 2F9 were maintained in culture on hES-qualified Matrigel (4354277, Corning) in complete mTeSR1 (85850, STEMCELL Technologies) at 37 °C. The cultures were passaged with Versene (15040066, ThermoFisher).
Human organoids were generated using a method adapted from a previously published protocol for cerebral organoid production ( Rai et al., 2021 82. Rai, M. ∙ Coleman, Z. ∙ Curley, M. ... Proteasome stress in skeletal muscle mounts a long-range protective response that delays retinal and brain aging Cell Metab. 2021; 33 :1137-1154.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, hiPSC cultures were dissociated into single cells with Accutase (AT-104, Innovative Cell Technologies) and plated into low-attachment 96-well V-bottom plates (MS-9096VZ, Sbio) at 9000 cells/well, in EB media (DMEM:F12, 20% Knockout Serum Replacement (10828, Life Technologies), 3% ES-FBS (ES-009-C, SIGMA), 1× Glutamax (Gibco), 1× β-mercaptoethanol (2020-07-30, Gibco), 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco) supplemented with 5 μM SB-431542 (TGFβ inhibitor, 1614, Tocris), 2 μM dorsomorphin (3093, Tocris), 3 μM IWR1e (Wnt inhibitor, 681669, EMD Millipore), 1% v/v growth factor–reduced Matrigel (354230, Corning), and 2 μM thiazovivin (72254, STEMCELL Technologies). Half the media was replaced on Day 2. On Days 4 and 6, half the media was replaced with GMEM KSR media (GMEM, 20% KSR, 1× NEAA (Gibco), 1× pyruvate (Gibco), 1× β-mercaptoethanol, 1× antibiotic-antimycotic) supplemented with 5 μM SB-431542, 3 μM IWR1e, 2.5 μM cyclopamine (72074, STEMCELL Technologies) and 2 μM thiazovivin. On Day 8, half the media was replaced with GMEM KSR media supplemented with 5 μM SB-431542, 3 μM IWR1e, and 2.5 μM cyclopamine. On Days 10, 12, 14, and 16, half the media was replaced with GMEM KSR media supplemented with 5 μM SB-431542 and 3 μM IWR1e. On Days 18 and 20, half the media was replaced with CBO N2 media (DMEM:F12, 1× chemically defined lipid concentrate (11905-031, Life Technologies), 1× N2 supplement (17502-048, Gibco) and 100× antibiotic-antimycotic) supplemented with 1× B27 supplement without vitamin A (12587-010, Gibco), 10 ng/mL bFGF (78003.1, STEMCELL Technologies), and 10 ng/mL EGF (AF-100-15-100UG, Peprotech). On Day 22, organoids were transferred to a magnetic stir bioreactor (BWS-S03N0S-6, ABLE Corporation) in CBO N2 media supplemented with 1× B27 supplement without vitamin A, 10 ng/mL bFGF, and 10 ng/ml EGF (AF-100-15-100UG, Peprotech), and agitated at 4 rpm. Half the media was replaced on Days 24, 26, and 28. On Day 30, the media was changed to CBO FBS media (DMEM:F12, 1× chemically defined lipid concentrate (11905-031, Life Technologies), 1× N2 supplement, 10% ES-FBS, 5 μg/mL heparin, and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic) supplemented with 1× B27 supplement without vitamin A. Complete media was replaced every 4 days. On Days 42 and 46, the media was changed to CBO FBS media supplemented with 1× B27 supplement without vitamin A, 10 ng/mL BDNF (450-02, Peprotech), and 10 ng/mL GDNF (450-10, Peprotech). Starting Day 50, the media was changed to BrainPhys media (05790, STEMCELL technologies) supplemented with 1× N2 supplement, 1× B27 supplement without vitamin A, 10 ng/mL BDNF, and 10 ng/mL GDNF. Complete media was replaced every 4 days. Starting at Day 35, large cerebral organoids were pinched into two halves by using a pair of sterile forceps; this was repeated once every 5–7 days to avoid large necrotic centers.
Statistics were calculated using Excel (Microsoft), Sigmaplot (Systat), Prism (Graphpad), R, or Python. Bar graphs, box plots, and violin plots show means ± SEM; overlaid dots show individual measurements. Statistical comparisons with significant results are noted in the text or figure legends. Unless otherwise noted, distributions were tested for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and equal variance (Brown-Forsythe test). If the distribution passed, a paired or unpaired t -test was performed. If it failed, a rank sum test or signed rank test was performed. To compare more than two distributions, one-way, two-way, or repeated measures ANOVAs were performed. To compare cumulative distributions, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. Significance was designated as P < 0.05. Comparisons with P > 0.05 were not reported.
