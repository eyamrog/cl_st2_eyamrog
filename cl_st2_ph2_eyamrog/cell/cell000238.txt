Title: CNS-Native Myeloid Cells Drive Immune Suppression in the Brain Metastatic Niche through Cxcl10


Abstract: Summary

Brain metastasis (br-met) develops in an immunologically unique br-met niche. Central nervous system-native myeloid cells (CNS-myeloids) and bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMDMs) cooperatively regulate brain immunity. The phenotypic heterogeneity and specific roles of these myeloid subsets in shaping the br-met niche to regulate br-met outgrowth have not been fully revealed. Applying multimodal single-cell analyses, we elucidated a heterogeneous but spatially defined CNS-myeloid response during br-met outgrowth. We found Ccr2 + BMDMs minimally influenced br-met while CNS-myeloid promoted br-met outgrowth. Additionally, br-met-associated CNS-myeloid exhibited downregulation of Cx3cr1. Cx3cr1 knockout in CNS-myeloid increased br-met incidence, leading to an enriched interferon response signature and Cxcl10 upregulation. Significantly, neutralization of Cxcl10 reduced br-met, while rCxcl10 increased br-met and recruited VISTA Hi PD-L1 + CNS-myeloid to br-met lesions. Inhibiting VISTA- and PD-L1-signaling relieved immune suppression and reduced br-met burden. Our results demonstrate that loss of Cx3cr1 in CNS-myeloid triggers a Cxcl10-mediated vicious cycle, cultivating a br-met-promoting, immune-suppressive niche.

Section: Introduction

Stephen Paget’s “seed and soil” hypothesis posited that metastatic success results from disseminated cancer cell (DCC)-metastatic niche interplay ( Paget, 1889 34. Paget, S. The distribution of secondary growths in cancer of the breast. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1889; 2 :98-101 Google Scholar ). The metastatic niche consists of unique organ-specific cellular and acellular components, which profoundly influence the progression of metastatic disease ( Peinado et al., 2017 36. Peinado, H. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Matei, I.R. ... Pre-metastatic niches: organ-specific homes for metastases Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2017; 17 :302-317 Crossref Scopus (1263) PubMed Google Scholar ; Quail and Joyce, 2013 41. Quail, D.F. ∙ Joyce, J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1423-1437 Crossref Scopus (5607) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Brain metastasis (br-met) is frequently observed clinically. The brain is a complex organ and favorable soil for DCCs derived from non-CNS primary tumors ( Achrol et al., 2019 1. Achrol, A.S. ∙ Rennert, R.C. ∙ Anders, C. ... Brain metastases Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2019; 5 :5 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). To successfully outgrow in the brain, DCCs must interact with brain-resident cells and infiltrating immune cells—the br-met niche ( Winkler, 2015 53. Winkler, F. The brain metastatic niche J. Mol. Med. (Berl.). 2015; 93 :1213-1220 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such br-met niche cells include astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia, among others ( Quail and Joyce, 2013 41. Quail, D.F. ∙ Joyce, J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1423-1437 Crossref Scopus (5607) PubMed Google Scholar ; Winkler, 2015 53. Winkler, F. The brain metastatic niche J. Mol. Med. (Berl.). 2015; 93 :1213-1220 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Once considered immune-privileged, the brain is now known to have an intricate, diverse immune presence during homeostasis and disease. Central nervous system-native myeloid cells (CNS-myeloids), namely, microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs), are the predominant immune population of the homeostatic brain and vitally contribute to brain homeostasis and diseases ( Butovsky and Weiner, 2018 7. Butovsky, O. ∙ Weiner, H.L. Microglial signatures and their role in health and disease Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2018; 19 :622-635 Crossref Scopus (538) PubMed Google Scholar ; Quail and Joyce, 2013 41. Quail, D.F. ∙ Joyce, J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1423-1437 Crossref Scopus (5607) PubMed Google Scholar ). During CNS pathologies, CNS-myeloids exhibit plasticity, playing either disease-resolving or disease-promoting roles ( Butovsky and Weiner, 2018 7. Butovsky, O. ∙ Weiner, H.L. Microglial signatures and their role in health and disease Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2018; 19 :622-635 Crossref Scopus (538) PubMed Google Scholar ; Prinz and Priller, 2014 37. Prinz, M. ∙ Priller, J.

Functioning non-redundantly to CNS-myeloids, peripheral bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMDMs) may infiltrate the brain parenchyma and contribute to neuroinflammation ( Prinz and Priller, 2014 37.

Pivotal mediators of CNS diseases, CNS-myeloids, and BMDMs are implicated in br-met progression. Immune gene signatures from human br-mets have provided clinical evidence on the correlation between the br-met immune niche and br-met outcome ( Fischer et al., 2019 12. Fischer, G.M. ∙ Jalali, A. ∙ Kircher, D.A. ... Molecular Profiling Reveals Unique Immune and Metabolic Features of Melanoma Brain Metastases Cancer Discov. 2019; 9 :628-645 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). CNS-myeloids and BMDMs have been observed in experimental br-met models ( Benbenishty et al., 2019 4. Benbenishty, A. ∙ Gadrich, M. ∙ Cottarelli, A. ... Prophylactic TLR9 stimulation reduces brain metastasis through microglia activation PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e2006859 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bowman et al., 2016 6.

Macrophage Ontogeny Underlies Differences in Tumor-Specific Education in Brain Malignancies Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :2445-2459 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). In experimental models, br-met-infiltrating myeloid cells reduce br-met by phagocytosis but have the ability to facilitate br-met through MMP3 and Cathepsin S secretion ( Benbenishty et al., 2019 4. Benbenishty, A. ∙ Gadrich, M. ∙ Cottarelli, A. ...

Analysis of tumour- and stroma-supplied proteolytic networks reveals a brain-metastasis-promoting role for cathepsin S Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16 :876-888 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) coupled with lineage tracing demonstrated stark transcriptional differences between CNS-myeloids and BMDMs in glioma ( Bowman et al., 2016 6.

Macrophage Ontogeny Underlies Differences in Tumor-Specific Education in Brain Malignancies Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :2445-2459 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies have further performed compositional and bulk transcriptional profiling of human gliomas and br-met-associated leukocytes to describe a diverse br-met immune niche, implying its potential functional significance ( Friebel et al., 2020 13. Friebel, E. ∙ Kapolou, K. ∙ Unger, S. ...

Interrogation of the Microenvironmental Landscape in Brain Tumors Reveals Disease-Specific Alterations of Immune Cells Cell. 2020; 181 :1643-1660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite these substantial efforts, the differential contributions of CNS-myeloids and BMDMs in regulating br-met have not yet been fully functionally or mechanistically resolved.
Single-cell analyses have provided novel insights into brain immunity ( Hammond et al., 2019 17. Hammond, T.R. ∙ Dufort, C. ∙ Dissing-Olesen, L. ...

In this study, combining single-cell analyses with transgenic mouse models targeting and manipulating myeloid cells, we sought to elucidate the role of heterogeneous br-met-associated myeloid cell subsets in regulating br-met outgrowth. We found CNS-myeloids are most influential in promoting br-met by fostering immune suppression via negative immune checkpoints VISTA and PD-L1. Combinatorial targeting of these immune checkpoints presents a new opportunity for clinical management of br-met.

Section: Results

Using a human br-met tissue array ( Table S1 ), we observed hypertrophic Iba1 + myeloid cells surrounded and infiltrated human br-mets regardless of primary tumor origin ( n patients = 37, n tumor origins = 14) ( Figure 1 A; Figure S1 A), supporting prior observations ( He et al., 2006 19. He, B.P. ∙ Wang, J.J. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Differential reactions of microglia to brain metastasis of lung cancer Mol. Med. 2006; 12 :161-170 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pukrop et al., 2010 39. Pukrop, T. ∙ Dehghani, F. ∙ Chuang, H.-N. ... Microglia promote colonization of brain tissue by breast cancer cells in a Wnt-dependent way Glia. 2010; 58 :1477-1489 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Iba1 + br-met-associated myeloid cells (Br.MAM) also accumulated around and within murine br-mets irrespective of brain anatomical location or br-met stage ( Figures 1 B and 1C; Figures S1 B–S1D). Br.MAM density increased within br-mets relative to the naive brain ( Figures 1 C and 1D; Figure S1 E). Despite morphological heterogeneity, most Br.MAM were hypertrophic with enlarged cell bodies and reduced protrusion features, indicative of activation and a robust response ( Figures 1 C and 1D) ( Heindl et al., 2018 21. Heindl, S. ∙ Gesierich, B. ∙ Benakis, C. ... Automated Morphological Analysis of Microglia After Stroke Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2018; 12 :106 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the morphological features assessed resulted in two groups, with naive myeloid cells (NMCs) assuming low morphology scores and Br.MAM assuming higher morphology scores, further suggesting their activation ( Heindl et al., 2018 21. Heindl, S. ∙ Gesierich, B. ∙ Benakis, C. ... Automated Morphological Analysis of Microglia After Stroke Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2018; 12 :106 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 E). Spatially, Br.MAM morphology scores increased approaching br-met lesion borders and were highest within br-met lesions ( Figure 1 F).
We next examined how br-mets altered the brain immune landscape by mass cytometry (CyTOF). t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) showed a contrast in surface-marker expression between the naive brain and br-met ( Figures 1 G–1I; Figures S1 F and S1G). Immune cells from br-mets more highly expressed myeloid cell and functional markers ( Figures 1 H and 1I; Figure S1 G). Manual gating indicated most naive brain leukocytes were homogeneous CNS-myeloids ( Figure 1 J; Figure S1 F), consistent with prior reports ( Mrdjen et al., 2018 31. Mrdjen, D. ∙ Pavlovic, A. ∙ Hartmann, F.J. ... High-Dimensional Single-Cell Mapping of Central Nervous System Immune Cells Reveals Distinct Myeloid Subsets in Health, Aging, and Disease Immunity. 2018; 48 :599 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, br-mets were immunologically diverse, inclusive to CNS-myeloids and peripherally derived immune cells, possessing a significant increase in all BMDM subsets and adaptive immune components compared to the naive brain ( Figure 1 J). Applying a gating scheme complementary to that which we used on mouse samples to human br-met CyTOF data ( Friebel et al., 2020 13. Friebel, E. ∙ Kapolou, K. ∙ Unger, S. ... Single-Cell Mapping of Human Brain Cancer Reveals Tumor-Specific Instruction of Tissue-Invading Leukocytes Cell. 2020; 181 :1626-1642 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found human br-met samples were likewise infiltrated by a diverse array of myeloid and T cell subsets ( Figures S1 H and S1I).
To reveal the molecular underpinnings of the two broad Br.MAM subsets in br-mets, we employed cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-seq) ( Stoeckius et al., 2017 49. Stoeckius, M. ∙ Hafemeister, C. ∙ Stephenson, W. ... Simultaneous epitope and transcriptome measurement in single cells Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :865-868 Crossref Scopus (1710) PubMed Google Scholar ), enabling simultaneous transcriptome and surface-marker profiling of naive and br-met-associated immune cells. Projecting sequenced cells from the two conditions on a UMAP showed unique clusters present only in br-mets ( Figure 2 A). Manual gating on DNA-barcoded antibodies identified CNS-myeloids and BMDMs ( Figure 2 B; Figures S2 A and S2B), the accuracy of which was confirmed by Tmem119 expression in CNS-myeloids and Itga4 expression in BMDMs ( Figure 2 C) ( Bowman et al., 2016 6. Bowman, R.L. ∙ Klemm, F. ∙ Akkari, L. ... Macrophage Ontogeny Underlies Differences in Tumor-Specific Education in Brain Malignancies Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :2445-2459 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reflecting CyTOF profiling, the ratio of CNS-myeloids to BMDMs was higher in the naive brain than in br-mets ( Figure 2 C).
CNS-myeloids were composed of eight transcriptional clusters that shifted on the UMAP between conditions ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). BAMs were restricted to cluster 3, while microglia of various transcriptional states composed the remaining clusters ( Figure 2 D). Cluster 0, marked by high expression of microglia homeostatic genes ( Cx3cr1 , Hexb , Jun ), was enriched with naive microglia ( Figure S2 C; Table S2 ). Cluster 2 resembled cluster 0 but had higher mitochondrial gene expression and slightly reduced microglia homeostatic gene expression, resembling a primed state ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). Clusters 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 represented distinct microglia inflammatory states, all of which had reduced expression of microglia homeostatic genes ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). Cluster 3, composed of BAMs, highly expressed antigen processing and presentation genes ( H2-Aa , Ha-Ab1 , Cd74 ) ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). Differential gene-expression analysis between br-met-associated CNS-myeloids and naive CNS-myeloids identified br-met-associated CNS-myeloids upregulated pro-inflammatory genes ( S100a4 , S100a6 , S100a10 ), anti-inflammatory genes ( Lgals1 , Lgals3 , Ifitm3 ), and migration genes ( Vim , Anxa ) and downregulated microglia homeostatic genes ( Cx3cr1 , P2ry12 , Hexb , Cst3 ) ( Figure 2 E; Table S2 ). Despite downregulating microglia homeostatic genes like Damage Associated Microglia (DAM) ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 23. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Spinrad, A. ∙ Weiner, A. ... A Unique Microglia Type Associated with Restricting Development of Alzheimer’s Disease Cell. 2017; 169 :1276-1290 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2877) PubMed Google Scholar ), there were no other gene-expression similarities between br-met-associated CNS-myeloids and DAM ( Figure S2 D). Last, br-met-associated CNS-myeloids were enriched for canonical macrophage functional pathways (endocytosis, Immunoglobulin E binding, extracellular matrix production and remodeling) and inflammatory pathways relative to their naive counterparts ( Figure 2 F; Table S2 ).
BMDMs segregated into eight transcriptional clusters ( Figure 2 G), representing canonical BMDM subsets as inferred by RNA and surface-marker expression ( Figure S3 A; Table S3 ). Stark transcriptional heterogeneity existed among and within canonically identified BMDMs but did not represent M1/M2 polarization ( Figure 2 G; Figure S3 B). Several BMDM clusters, including clusters 0 (Ly6C Hi monocytes), 1 (Ly6C Lo DCs), 5 (neutrophils), and 7, were more abundant in br-mets relative to the naive brain, representing their influx to the brain and/or local expansion ( Figure S2 C). Genes related to inflammation ( Tspo , Isg15 , Ifitm2 , Anxa2 , Irf7 ) were upregulated, while Hbb-bs , Serinc3 , Cd81 , and Klf2 were downregulated in br-met-associated BMDMs ( Figure 2 H; Table S3 ). Br-met-associated BMDMs had higher enrichment of antigen processing and presentation and immune responsiveness pathways and lower enrichment of motility and lipoxin synthesis pathways ( Figure 2 I; Table S3 ). We further subsetted BMDMs into three broad canonically related categories for further analysis: Ly6C Hi inflammatory monocytes, Ly6C Lo patrolling monocytes, and neutrophils ( Figures S3 C–S3E). The transcriptional subclusters of each BMDM subset represented distinct canonical subtypes of BMDM and/or distinct transcriptional states ( Figures S3 C–S3E). Shifting of cluster proportions within each BMDM subpopulation was evident between the naive and br-met state ( Figures S3 C–S3E), suggesting cell infiltration and plasticity. Finally, we compared gene expression between conditions within each BMDM subset, finding all subsets increased expression of various inflammatory genes ( Ifitm1 , Il1b , S100a10 , and Lgals1 ), while simultaneously displaying their own unique gene expression changes ( Figures S3 C–S3E).
To validate the human relevance of our observations, we analyzed publicly deposited naive CNS-myeloids (n patients = 3) and br-met (n patients = 3) scRNA-seq datasets ( Geirsdottir et al., 2019 14. Geirsdottir, L. ∙ David, E. ∙ Keren-Shaul, H. ... Cross-Species Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Divergence of the Primate Microglia Program Cell. 2019; 179 :1609-1622 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Laughney et al., 2020 26. Laughney, A.M. ∙ Hu, J. ∙ Campbell, N.R. ... Regenerative lineages and immune-mediated pruning in lung cancer metastasis Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :259-269 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A). As in mice, human br-met-associated CNS-myeloids downregulated microglia homeostatic genes ( CX3CR1 , CSF1R , TREM2 ) ( Figures 3 B and 3C; Table S4 ). Some of the top upregulated and downregulated genes in mouse br-met-associated CNS-myeloids showed similar trends in humans (upregulated: VIM , LGALS3 , IFITM2 , LYZ ; downregulated: GFP34 , CD81 ) ( Figures 3 B, 3D, and 3E; Table S4 ). Cumulatively, these data point toward an active and diverse myeloid response to br-met and indicate our model is clinically relevant.
We next directly compared br-met-associated CNS-myeloids and BMDMs. Projecting only br-met-associated myeloid cells on a tSNE showed a general segregation of the two populations with some overlap, particularly in clusters 2 and 4 ( Figure 4 A). CNS-myeloids were enriched for microglia homeostatic genes and complement genes relative to BMDMs ( Figure 4 B; Table S5 ). BMDMs more highly expressed inflammatory genes ( S100a11 , Lgals , and Il1b ) relative to CNS-myeloids ( Figure 4 B; Table S5 ). At the gene pathway level, CNS-myeloids were marked by migratory and regulatory gene signatures, while BMDMs were enriched for cell adhesion and antigen-presentation signatures ( Figure 4 C; Table S5 ).
To investigate the transcriptional plasticity of CNS-myeloids and BMDMs during br-met, we performed RNA velocity ( La Manno et al., 2018 25. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1950) PubMed Google Scholar ). RNA velocity showed CNS-myeloids and BMDMs have trajectories directed within their own respective populations and toward each other ( Figure 4 D, points a and b). Using Dynverse trajectory inference (TI) analysis ( Saelens et al., 2019 44. Saelens, W. ∙ Cannoodt, R. ∙ Todorov, H. ... A comparison of single-cell trajectory inference methods Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :547-554 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined genes correlated with cell trajectory that may drive convergence within (point b) and between (point a) populations ( Figure 4 E). Inflammatory genes ( S100 family genes, Il1b , Tgfbi ) were highly expressed along the trajectory of cells leading to both convergent points ( Figure 4 E). Upon arriving to point a, cells bifurcated into two separate trajectories that either upregulated microglia homeostatic genes ( Jun , Fos ) or highly expressed mitochondrial genes ( Figure 4 E). Cells converging to point b upregulated genes related to antigen presentation ( CD74 and H2-Aa ) and complement ( C1qc , C1qa ) ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Seeking transcription factors (TFs) that potentially regulate the cellular convergence, we performed SCENIC regulon analysis ( Aibar et al., 2017 2. Aibar, S. ∙ González-Blas, C.B. ∙ Moerman, T. ... SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :1083-1086 Crossref Scopus (2530) PubMed Google Scholar ). TFs Cepbp and Lrrfip1 were enriched in cells moving to point a and point b, respectively ( Figure 4 G). TFs Mef2c and Atf3 were enriched within point a and point b cells, respectively ( Figure 4 G). Many target genes of these TFs contribute to the convergence processes along the predicted trajectory (genes in green font on heatmaps in Figure 4 E). Collectively, these results highlight myeloid plasticity and suggest there is an appreciable level of transcriptional convergence within and between CNS-myeloids and BMDMs during br-met, the importance of which requires future investigation.
The spatial distribution of immune cells determines their roles during disease ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 23. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Spinrad, A. ∙ Weiner, A. ... A Unique Microglia Type Associated with Restricting Development of Alzheimer’s Disease Cell. 2017; 169 :1276-1290 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2877) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rivera and Bergers, 2013 42. Rivera, L.B. ∙ Bergers, G. Location, location, location: macrophage positioning within tumors determines pro- or antitumor activity Cancer Cell. 2013; 24 :687-689 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). We interrogated the spatial distribution of Br.MAM clusters by performing dual RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) and Iba1 immunofluorescence (IF). We selected marker genes for each cluster: Il-1b for clusters 0 and 3, P2ry12 for cluster 1, and Ybx3 for cluster 4 ( Figure 4 H). All four transcriptional clusters were present nearer to br-mets rather than distal to br-mets ( Figure 4 I). Il-1b , marker of clusters 0 and 3, was only slightly increased in myeloid cells near br-mets, indicating clusters 0 and 3 are less spatially defined ( Figure 4 I). P2ry12 , the cluster 1 marker, displayed a moderate spatial association with br-mets, while Ybx3 , the cluster 4 marker, was expressed in Br.MAM in direct contact with br-mets ( Figure 4 I).
To determine the functional effect of myeloid cells during br-met outgrowth, we used Cx3cr1 CreERT/+ :ROSA26 iDTR/+ mice to deplete myeloid cells during br-met outgrowth ( Figure 5 A). We characterized Cx3cr1-driven reporter expression in splenocytes and analyzed Cx3cr1 protein expression in naive and br-met-associated brain leukocytes. All myeloid cells expressed the ZsGreen reporter or moderate to high levels of Cx3cr1 ( Figure S4 ). Few T cells or natural killer (NK) cells expressed the reporter or Cx3cr1, suggesting this model largely targets myeloid cells ( Figure S4 ).
We administered tamoxifen (TAM) and diphtheria toxin (DT) to these mice in a scheme that ensured thorough depletion of myeloid cells during br-met outgrowth, eliminating ∼75% of myeloid cells in br-mets relative to control mice lacking the iDTR transgene ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Myeloid-depleted mice had reduced br-met burden and br-met proliferation ( Figure 5 C; Figure S5 A), demonstrating a br-met-promoting role for the general myeloid population and corroborating previous reports ( Andreou et al., 2017 3. Andreou, K.E. ∙ Soto, M.S. ∙ Allen, D. ... Anti-inflammatory Microglia/Macrophages As a Potential Therapeutic Target in Brain Metastasis Front. Oncol. 2017; 7 :251 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qiao et al., 2019 40. Qiao, S. ∙ Qian, Y. ∙ Xu, G. ... Long-term characterization of activated microglia/macrophages facilitating the development of experimental brain metastasis through intravital microscopic imaging J. Neuroinflammation. 2019; 16 :4 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also depleted myeloid cells prior to metastatic seeding and at the colonization stage of br-met ( Figure S5 B). In this depletion scheme, myeloid cells are depleted during the metastatic seeding stage, but microglia repopulate and newly generated BMDMs infiltrate br-mets by the metastatic outgrowth phase ( Figure S5 C) ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 35. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ). Depletion of myeloid cells during br-met colonization had no significant effect on endpoint br-met number ( Figure S5 D).
The presence of both CNS-myeloids and BMDMs in br-mets prompted us to dissect the specific role of each myeloid subset on br-met outgrowth. First, we utilized a Ccr2 knockout mouse in which the Ccr2 gene is replaced by RFP ( Figure 5 D) to determine the contribution of BMDMs on br-met outgrowth. Ccr2 knockout prevents the chemotaxis of Ccr2 + BMDMs to sites of inflammation. Analysis of RFP expression in peripheral blood cells demonstrated that ∼90%, ∼18%, and <1% of Ly6C Hi monocytes, Ly6C Lo monocytes, and neutrophils, respectively, express RFP ( Figure S5 E). These data suggest that this model most significantly reduces br-met-associated Ly6C Hi monocytes, the most abundant br-met-associated BMDM subset in mice ( Figure 1 J). While Ccr2 knockout in hosts reduced lung metastasis and glioma outgrowth ( Chen et al., 2017 9. Chen, Z. ∙ Feng, X. ∙ Herting, C.J. ...

To manipulate CNS-myeloids, we employed a temporally segregated TAM and DT administration strategy as described previously to exclusively deplete CNS-myeloids in Cx3cr1 CreERT/+ :ROSA26 iDTR/+ mice ( Figure 5 G) ( Goldmann et al., 2016 15.

Fate mapping reveals origins and dynamics of monocytes and tissue macrophages under homeostasis Immunity. 2013; 38 :79-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2234) PubMed Google Scholar ). This scheme depleted approximately two-thirds of CNS-myeloids while sparing BMDMs and minimally altering blood immune composition and peripheral immune cell composition in the brain ( Figure 5 H; Figure S5 J ) . After depletion, remnant CNS-myeloids exhibited upregulation of apoptosis-related genes ( Ctsd , Phlda1 ), ribosomal genes ( Rpl10 , Rpl10a ), and Cx3cr1 , and the downregulation of interferon-related genes ( Isg15 , Rsad , Ifit ) and cytokines ( Ccl7 ) ( Figure S5 K). Proportions of T cells remained similar between experimental conditions ( Figure S5 J), but within CD8 + T cells, the proportion of exhausted T cells decreased and that of mildly cytotoxic T cells increased with CNS-myeloid depletion ( Figures S5 L–S5N). Most importantly, CNS-myeloid depletion reduced br-met burden ( Figure 5 I). These results collectively indicate that CNS-myeloids more prominently influence br-met outgrowth than BMDMs.
The fractalkine receptor, Cx3cr1, is highly expressed in steady-state microglia and maintains their homeostasis ( Wolf et al., 2013 54. Wolf, Y. ∙ Yona, S. ∙ Kim, K.-W. ... Microglia, seen from the CX3CR1 angle Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7 :26 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cx3cr1 downregulation and its uncoupling from Cx3cl1 allow microglia to mount an inflammatory response, and genetic ablation of Cx3cr1 in mice can improve disease outcome ( Cardona et al., 2006 8. Cardona, A.E. ∙ Pioro, E.P. ∙ Sasse, M.E. ... Control of microglial neurotoxicity by the fractalkine receptor Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9 :917-924 Crossref Scopus (1239) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cx3cr1 was significantly downregulated in br-met-associated CNS-myeloids in our mouse model and human br-mets ( Figures 2 E and 3 C), which was reflected at the protein level in mice ( Figure 6 A). We questioned the functional implication of Cx3cr1 downregulation on regulating br-met by using Cx3cr1 −/− mice (knockout [KO] mice) ( Figure S6 A). Cx3cr1 KO in hosts increased br-met number and proliferation and reduced host survival relative to Cx3cr1 +/− (Het) hosts ( Figures 6 B–6D).
Cx3cr1 KO caused minor immune compositional changes in the peripheral blood and naive brain but increased brain infiltration of monocytes during br-met ( Figure S6 B). Ly6C Lo monocytes are Cx3cr1 Hi ( Figure S6 C) and thus may be targeted by whole-body Cx3cr1 KO, which may alter their frequency or functionality in br-mets. To mitigate the potential effect of Cx3cr1 KO on BMDMs, we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) on Cx3cr1 Het and KO mice to restrict Cx3cr1 KO to CNS-myeloids ( Figure 6 E). During irradiation, we shielded the skulls of recipient mice to maintain the original Cx3cr1 genotype in CNS-myeloids and prevent blood-brain barrier damage ( Figure 6 E). Four months post-BMT, the peripheral immune system was ∼60% reconstituted ( Figure S6 D). KO BMT mice formed more br-mets than Het BMT mice ( Figure 6 E), phenocopying the effect of whole-body Cx3cr1 KO mice and strongly suggesting the effects of Cx3cr1 KO are mostly attributable to its loss in CNS-myeloids.
In naive mice, we found KO brain myeloid cells had a drastically increased protrusion number, thinner protrusions, and increased cell volume relative to Het myeloid cells ( Figure S6 E), suggesting their activation ( Heindl et al., 2018 21. Heindl, S. ∙ Gesierich, B. ∙ Benakis, C. ... Automated Morphological Analysis of Microglia After Stroke Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2018; 12 :106 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). To gain insight into the molecular underpinnings of KO CNS-myeloids, we performed CITE-seq and focused our analyses to CNS-myeloids due to their more significant contribution to br-met via Cx3cr1 ( Figures 5 D–5I; Figure 6 E). Het and KO CNS-myeloids contributed to six transcriptional clusters ( Figure 6 F). Clusters 0 and 4 shifted on the UMAP between genotypes, and cluster 2, 3, and 4 cells were more frequent in KO mice than Het mice ( Figure 6 F). The Moserle-IFNA-Response pathway was the most highly enriched gene pathway in KO CNS-myeloids relative to Het CNS-myeloids ( Figure 6 G; Table S6 ). Interferon-related genes ( Cxcl10 , Rsad2 , Ifitm3 , Ifit1 , Irf7 , Isg15 ) were consistently the most upregulated genes in KO CNS-myeloids ( Figure 6 H; Table S6 ). Interferon-induced gene Cxcl10 was the second most upregulated gene in KO CNS-myeloids and was inversely correlated to Cx3cr1 ( Figure 6 I). Cxcl10 expression was increased among all CNS-myeloid transcriptional clusters except cluster 2 ( Figure 6 I) and remained largely unchanged among BMDM subsets ( Figures S6 F and S6G).
To determine the influence of Cxcl10 on br-met, we first performed a loss of function experiment in which we intracranially co-injected αCxcl10 antibody with E0771.Br cells in a KO host. Brain hemispheres injected with cancer cells and αCxcl10 formed smaller br.met than control hemispheres injected with cancer cells and HBSS ( Figure 6 J). In a complementary gain-of-function experiment, we intracranially co-injected recombinant Cxcl10 (rCxcl10) and E0771.Br cells. Brain hemispheres injected with cancer cells and rCxcl10 formed larger br.met than control hemispheres co-injected with cancer cells and HBSS ( Figure 6 K). Together, these studies indicate a causal role for Cxcl10 in promoting br-met outgrowth.
To confirm the relevance of Cxcl10 in human br-mets, we performed dual Cxcl10 RNA-ISH and Iba1 IF on human tissue ( Table S1 ). Cxcl10 expression increased in myeloid cells in human br-mets (n patients = 37, n tumor origins = 14) relative to the naive human brain (n patients = 4) ( Figure 6 L; Figure S6 H), which we confirmed in an independent group of br-met patients (n patients = 5, n tumor origins = 3) ( Figure 6 M; Table S1 ).
We next sought to determine how Cxcl10 promoted br-met. rCxcl10 did not stimulate cancer cell proliferation, nor did E0771.Br express Cxcr3 ( Figures S6 I and S6J), suggesting Cxcl10 promotes br-met through tumor cell non-autonomous means.
Cxcl10 is an immune modulator ( Liu et al., 2011 28. Liu, M. ∙ Guo, S. ∙ Stiles, J.K. The emerging role of CXCL10 in cancer (Review) Oncol. Lett. 2011; 2 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore Cxcl10 regulation of br-met immune composition, we performed CyTOF on control br-met-burdened brains and brains injected with tumor cells and rCxcl10. rCxcl10 co-injection increased myeloid cells marked by CD86, CD11c, and MHCII expression ( Figure S7 A). As Br.MAM accumulated within br-mets ( Figures 1 A–1C; Figure 5 I), we examined the spatial aspects of CD86 + CNS-myeloids in situ . CD86 + CNS-myeloids were nearly exclusively found within br-met lesions and ∼3-fold more concentrated within br-mets than distal to br-mets ( Figures 7 A and 7B). To explore whether Cxcl10 could mediate CNS-myeloid recruitment, we performed an in vitro transwell migration assay. rCxcl10 enhanced SIM-A9 microglia migration across transwell inserts by ∼50% relative to control wells ( Figure 7 C). Collectively, these findings suggest that Cxcl10 recruits potentially pro-br-met CD86 + CNS-myeloid cells to br-met lesions.
Tumor infiltration of myeloid cells that co-express CD86, CD11c, and MHCII is typically correlated with an anti-cancer response. Paradoxically, such a population correlated with increased br-met. We hypothesized intra-metastatic CD86 + CNS-myeloids could barricade T cell infiltration to br-met lesions and/or engage with and suppress T cells. T cells were not apparently barricaded from the br-met lesions, but >90% of br-met-associated T cells contacted Br.MAM ( Figure 7 D), suggesting myeloid-T cell engagement.
To explore the potential of CNS-myeloid suppression of T cells, we queried CD86 + Br.MAM gene set enrichment ( Figures S7 B and S7C). CD86 + Br.MAM upregulated numerous immunosuppressive pathways, including the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, CTLA-4 signaling, and FOXP3 targets ( Figure S7 C). Examination of negative immune checkpoint gene expression among all br-met niche cells showed CNS-myeloids expressed several checkpoint genes, including Vsir (VISTA) and Cd274 (PD-L1) ( Figure S7 D). Vsir was enriched in CNS-myeloids relative to other br-met niche cells ( Figure 7 E; Figure S7 D). PD-L1 was expressed on CNS-myeloids and expressed slightly higher on BMDMs ( Figure 7 E; Figure S7 D) but was mostly present on Ly6C Hi monocytes, which we demonstrated do not affect br-met outgrowth ( Figures 5 D–5F). We additionally examined the expression dynamics and spatial features of VISTA and PD-L1. CNS-myeloids constitutively expressed Vsir highly ( Figure 7 F), whereas they expressed PD-L1 at a low level in the naive state and modestly upregulated PD-L1 during br-met ( Figure 7 F). Despite slight downregulation of Vsir during br-met ( Figure 7 F), VISTA + CNS-myeloid density approximately doubled within the br-met lesions relative to regions distal to br-mets ( Figure 7 G). Cumulatively, these data suggest that CNS-myeloids could suppress T cells via VISTA and PD-L1.
Given the non-redundant nature of immune suppression, we co-inhibited PD-L1 and VISTA signaling to determine their influence on br-met outgrowth. Co-treatment with αVISTA and αPD-L1 antibodies, but not single treatments, reduced br-met burden compared to control mice ( Figure 7 H; Figure S7 E). αVISTA and αPD-L1 co-treatment increased CD3 + cell abundance and the frequency of T cell subsets ( Figures 7 I–7J) and upregulated some T cell activation genes ( Stat1 , Gzmk , Ifi27l2a , and Txn1 ) and ribosomal genes ( Figure 7 K; Figure S7 F). Within CD8 + T cells, dual therapy moderately increased the proportion of mildly cytotoxic cells and slightly increased the proportions of highly cytotoxic and proliferative cells ( Figure 7 L). CNS-myeloids exhibited no major transcriptional changes with dual therapy, but BMDMs were marked by the upregulation of antigen-presentation genes, Stat1 , and Ifitm1 , which may represent effects from the altered inflammatory milieu induced by the therapy ( Figure S7 G). While our data suggest αVISTA and αPD-L1 treatment reduces CNS-myeloid suppression of T cells in the br-met niche, the potential expression and functional contribution of these proteins on cells peripherally in lymphoid organs during br-met warrants future investigation.

Section: Discussion

Although myeloid cell subsets have been observed within br-mets ( He et al., 2006 19. He, B.P. ∙ Wang, J.J. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Differential reactions of microglia to brain metastasis of lung cancer Mol. Med. 2006; 12 :161-170 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2015 59. Zhang, L. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Yao, J. ... Microenvironment-induced PTEN loss by exosomal microRNA primes brain metastasis outgrowth Nature. 2015; 527 :100-104 Crossref Scopus (959) PubMed Google Scholar ), their phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have not been fully revealed. Through single-cell analyses, we characterized the compositional and transcriptional heterogeneity of br-met-associated leukocytes and modeled Br.MAM plasticity. We identified extensive compositional and transcriptional changes during br-met that implicated multiple immune cell types and molecular mediators in br-met regulation, supporting recent immune profiling studies in human brain tumors ( Friebel et al., 2020 13.

Our single-cell analyses refute the oversimplified binary view of myeloid polarization and echo a multi-dimensional model of myeloid cell activation ( Xue et al., 2014 55. Xue, J. ∙ Schmidt, S.V. ∙ Sander, J. ... Transcriptome-based network analysis reveals a spectrum model of human macrophage activation Immunity. 2014; 40 :274-288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1525) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, our analyses uncovered the plastic nature of CNS-myeloids and BMDMs during br-met ( Figure 4 ). The plasticity we report reflects that of previous findings of BMDMs becoming CNS-myeloid-like upon translocation to the brain ( Bennett et al., 2018 5. Bennett, F.C. ∙ Bennett, M.L. ∙ Yaqoob, F. ...

Tissue-resident macrophage enhancer landscapes are shaped by the local microenvironment Cell. 2014; 159 :1312-1326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1535) PubMed Google Scholar ) and also suggests the potential for CNS-myeloids to take on characteristics of infiltrating BMDMs. Such dynamics and their functional relevance to br-met necessitate future in-depth study.
The br-met-promoting role of Cxcl10 that we report is seemingly paradoxical given the canonical role of Cxcl10 in recruiting disease-resolving T cells ( Liu et al., 2011 28. Liu, M. ∙ Guo, S. ∙ Stiles, J.K. The emerging role of CXCL10 in cancer (Review) Oncol. Lett. 2011; 2 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). To reconcile the differences, it is important to acknowledge that the brain is immunologically unique and has evolved to be anti-inflammatory for neuro-protection ( Deczkowska et al., 2018 10. Deczkowska, A. ∙ Amit, I. ∙ Schwartz, M. Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :779-786 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ; Norris and Kipnis, 2019 33. Norris, G.T. ∙ Kipnis, J. Immune cells and CNS physiology: Microglia and beyond J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :60-70 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). The blood-brain barrier and high expression of negative checkpoints, such as VISTA, in CNS-myeloids represent two such brain-specific anti-inflammatory evolutionary adaptations ( Deczkowska et al., 2018 10. Deczkowska, A. ∙ Amit, I. ∙ Schwartz, M. Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :779-786 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ; Norris and Kipnis, 2019 33. Norris, G.T. ∙ Kipnis, J. Immune cells and CNS physiology: Microglia and beyond J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :60-70 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). While VISTA expression in CNS-myeloids is similar between the naive state and br-met, VISTA + CNS-myeloid density increases within br-met lesions. Although Cxcl10 potentially recruits T cells to br-mets, Cxcl10 can attract CNS-myeloids, which carry immunosuppressive proteins that dampen T cell activation. We posit that the potential anti-tumor benefit of Cxcl10-mediated T cell recruitment is counteracted by the accumulation of T cell-suppressive CNS-myeloids ( Figure 7 M). While this mechanism may confer benefits in autoimmune brain diseases, it undesirably fosters an immune suppressive niche for br-met to thrive.
In summary, we demonstrated that CNS-myeloid facilitate br-met via Cxcl10 signaling that fosters an immune suppressive niche. In light of our findings and recent clinical studies ( Tawbi et al., 2018 51. Tawbi, H.A. ∙ Forsyth, P.A. ∙ Algazi, A. ... Combined Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Melanoma Metastatic to the Brain N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 379 :722-730 Crossref Scopus (933) PubMed Google Scholar ), further research on the immune suppressive capabilities of the br-met niche is necessary in order to design more effective immune therapy regimens for br-met patients.

All animal studies were performed ethically and in compliance with IACUC protocol approved by the University of Notre Dame IACUC committee. C57BL/6 (000664/Black 6); B6.129P2(Cg)-Cx3cr1 tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Litt/WganJ (021160/Cx3cr1 CreER ); C57BL/6-Gt(ROSA)26 Sortm1 (HBEGF) Awai/J (007900/ROSA25 iDTR ); B6.129P-Cx3cr1 tm1Litt/J (005582/CX3CR1-GFP); B6.129(Cg)-Ccr2 tm2.1Ifc/J (017586/Ccr2 RFP); B6.Cg- Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm6(CAG-ZsGreen1)Hze /J (007906/Ai6) mouse lines were purchased from Jackson Lab (Ben Harbor, ME). Cx3cr1 CreER/+ :R26 iDTR/+ double transgenic mice were produced in-house by breeding Cx3cr1 CreER with ROSA26 iDTR mice. Cx3cr1 CreER/+ mice, used as controls in general myeloid and CNS-myeloid depletion studies, were produced in-house by breeding Cx3cr1 CreER mice to C57BL/6 mice. Cx3cr1 GFP/+ mice were produced in-house by breeding Cx3cr1-GFP mice to C57BL/6 mice. Ccr2 RFP/+ mice were obtained by breeding Ccr2 RFP mice to C57BL/6 mice. Mice were bred and maintained by Friemann Life Science Center (FLSC) at the University of Notre Dame, with the exception of some C57BL/6, which were bred and maintained for some time at Jackson Lab, but acclimated for a minimum of 1 week in FLSC prior to experimental use. All mice used in experiments were females aged from 2 months to 12 months. Females were exclusively used as breast cancer br-met is predominantly a female pathology. For αVISTA and αPD-L1 related experiments, mice were randomized after metastasis initiation but before administration of immune therapy. For experiments in which br-met-burdened brains and naive brains were compared, mice were randomized prior to metastasis initiation. For all other experiments, randomization was not possible as the comparison point was mouse genotype. No power analyses were used to predetermine sample sizes in mouse experiments. However, sample sizes were chosen based on prior literature using similar experimental paradigms.
Human brain metastasis (GL861) and normal brain (T174b) tissue arrays were purchased from US Biomax, Inc (Derwood, MD). Details of each array can be found on the Biomax website (brain metastasis array: https://www.biomax.us/tissue-arrays/Brain/GL861 ; normal brain array: https://www.biomax.us/tissue-arrays/Brain/T174b ), and in Table S1 . Additional human brain metastasis tissue sections were obtained from the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Bank, details of which can be found in Table S1 .
E0771 cell line (female origin) was purchased from CH3 Biosystems (Amherst, NY, 940001-Vial), CMT 167 cell line (female origin) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (10032302-1VL), and SIM-A9 (unknow sex origin as derived from P1 pups) were purchased from ATCC (ATCC-CRL-3265). B16BL6 cell line (male origin) was a gift from Dihua Yu’s lab (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Brain seeking E0771 lines (E0771.Br) used in this study were generated by one round of in vivo selection for homing to the brain. E0771 cells were labeled with mCherry or ZsGreen by lentiviral transduction. E0771 cells were cultured in RPMI + 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, and CMT 167 and B16BL6 cells were cultured in DMEM High Glucose + 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. SIM-A9 cells were cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% heat inactivated FBS + 5% heat inactivated horse serum. All cell lines were incubated at 37C, 5% CO 2 , humidity ∼95%. Cell lines were tested and found negative for mouse pathogens by IDEXX BioResearch Inc. (IMPACT IV panel: PCR evaluation for: LCMV, MHV, MPV, MVM, Mycoplasma pulmonis, Mycoplasma sp., PVM, Sendai, TMEV).
For generation of brain metastasis in mice by cardiac injection, 2x10 5 cells were inoculated into the left cardiac ventricle of mice. Cardiac injections were used for experiments presented in Figures 1 B–1F, 4 I, 5 A–5F, and 6 B–6D (E0771 experiments only). For generation of brain metastasis by intracranial injection, only used in experiments related to Figures 6 J and 6K in which anti-Cxcl10 or rCxcl10 needed to be directly injected to the metastatic lesion, approximately 5,000 cells were stereotaxically injected using a fine glass capillary needle and nanoliter injector (Nanoject II 3-000-204, Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA) 1.25mm lateral and 1.5mm caudal relative to bregma, and 1.0mm deep. For generation of brain metastasis by carotid injection, 2-3x10 5 cells were injected into the carotid artery, which were used in all other experiments not listed above.
To deplete the general Cx3cr1+ myeloid population in CX 3 CR1 CreERT/+ :R26 iDTR/+ mice, mice were first administered 75mg kg -1 Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) dissolved in corn oil (Sigma, C8267) by intraperitoneal injection once daily for 10 consecutive days before tumor cell inoculation, and then daily thereafter, to induce genetic recombination. Mice were administered 1 μg Diphtheria Toxin (Sigma, D0564) dissolved in 100 μL sterile saline by intraperitoneal injection either (for outgrowth depletion) every other day beginning 7 days post-tumor cell inoculation or (for early depletion) three consecutive days prior to and one day following tumor cell injection. Tamoxifen and Diphtheria Toxin doses were reduced or skipped in some cases when mice were deemed too unhealthy and unable to handle further drug administration. For CNS-myeloid cell exclusive depletion, Tamoxifen and Diphtheria Toxin concentrations were identical to that used for general myeloid depletion, but the administration timings differed. Mice were treated with Tamoxifen for 10 consecutive days. A minimum of one month following Tamoxifen cessation, mice were injected with cancer cells, four days after which mice were administered Diphtheria Toxin every three days until experimental endpoint.
Cx3cr1 Het and KO mice were irradiated twice, approximately 12 hours apart, receiving 525 rad per irradiation dose. Before irradiation in RS 2000 Biological Research Irradiator (Rad Source Technologies, Inc.), mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine so that their heads could be positioned under a lead scaffold for the duration of irradiation to prevent the brain from receiving irradiation. Mice were reconstituted 24 hours after first radiation dose by retroorbital injection of approximately 5 million C57BL/6 wild-type donor-derived bone marrow cells supplemented with approximately 1 million C57BL/6 wild-type donor-derived T cells isolated from the spleen by pan T cell enrichment. Reconstituted mice were housed in sterile conditions for three months, after which reconstitution success was evaluated by flow cytometry, examining GFP expression in peripheral blood cell subsets relative to Cx3cr1 Het and KO counterparts that did not receive irradiation or BMT.
For in vivo mouse recombinant Cxcl10 ligand (R&D Systems, 466-CR-010/CF) treatment, approximately 2.76ng of rCxcl10 dissolved in HBSS (Cytiva Life Sciences, SH30588.01) was co-injected with cancer cells. For in vivo goat anti-mouse Cxcl10 (R&D Systems, AF-466-SP) treatment of Cx3cr1-KO hosts, approximately 2.5 μg of anti-Cxcl10 was co-injected with cancer cells. For dual immune checkpoint inhibition treatment, 300 μg of armenian hamster anti-mouse VISTA (BioXCell, BE0310) and 200 μg of rat anti-mouse PD-L1 (BioXCell, BE0101) were injected every two days starting three days following cancer cell injection. The same scheme was used for single immune checkpoint antibody blockade experiments.
E0771.Br cells were plated at a density of 3,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate and treated with either rCxcl10 (R&D Systems,1245-GA-050) in triplicate with 1, 10, or 100ng of ligand per well. Following at least 48 hours of culture with ligand, an MTT assay was performed. Briefly, filtered 10mg/mL MTT solution (Sigma, M5655) was added to each well and incubated for 2 hours. After MTT incubation, SDS-based lysis buffer added for two hours until cells were solubilized. Finally, the plates were read on a plate reader at 570nm. For SIM-A9 microglia transwell migration assay, 50ng/mL rCxcl10 in media or media alone was placed below the 8um transwell insert (Corning, 3464) and SIM-A9 microglia were seeded on top of the transwell insert. 24 hours after seeding, non-migrated cells on the top of the membrane were removed with a cotton tip applicator, and the cells that had migrated to the opposite side of the membrane were fixed in 4% PFA, stained with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific, D1306), and 3 random fields of view per membrane were imaged. Subsequently, cells were counted and averaged to determine the number of migrated cells per well. The above in vitro studies were performed once.
For tissue collection for histological analysis, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Mice were then transcardially perfused with cold 1x PBS followed by cold 4% PFA. Tissue isolated for flow cytometry, CyTOF, or single cell RNA-seq analysis was collected identically with the exception that 4% PFA perfusion was excluded. Cells were isolated from mouse brains by digesting the brains into single cell suspensions and then enriched from other neural cells by density gradient centrifugation as follows: Brains from mice transcardially perfused with 1x PBS were extracted, minced with scissors, and triturated with a P1000 micropipette. The resulting brain tissue slurry was centrifuged at 300 g for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended and processed as directed by the Miltenyi Biotec Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-628) or Multi-tissue Dissociation Kit I (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-110-201). Brains were enzymatically digested into a single cell suspension by rotating at 37C for approximately 25 minutes with trituration half way through incubation. The resulting cell suspension was strained through a 100 μm cell filter as needed, diluted in 1x HBSS, and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 3mL 70% Percoll (GE Healthcare, 17-0891-02). The Percoll gradient and density layering was prepared (from bottom to top: 70%, 37%, 30%). Density gradient centrifugation was performed for 20 minutes at 2000rpm with no break. Myeloid cells were isolated from the buffy layer between the interface of the clear Percoll and red-colored Percoll. Following washing in 1x HBSS, the resultant cell suspension was processed as required for the desired application.
Brain-derived cells were prepared for flow cytometry in a manner identical to that of their preparation for scRNA-seq through the Percoll gradient centrifugation step. Following gradient centrifugation, cells were washed in Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend, 20201). For experiments relying on antibody staining, FC receptors were blocked by incubation with TruStain fcX in 100uL Cell Staining Buffer for 30 min at RT and then stained with one or a combination of the following antibodies: rat anti-mouse CD45-421 (Biolegend, 103133, 30-F11), rat anti-mouse CD4-PE (Biolegend, 100407, GK1.5), rat anti-mouse CD3-647 (Biolegend, 100209., 17A2), rat anti-mouse CD8-APC/Cy7 (Biolegend, 100713, 53-A7), rat anti-mouse Gr1-594 (Biolegend, 108448, Rb6-8C5), rat anti-mouse Ly6G-APC (Biolegend,127613, 1A8), rat anti-mouse Ly6C-PE (Biolegend, 128007, HK1.4), rat anti-mouse Ly6C-FITC (Biolegend, 128005, HK1.4), rat anti-mouse Ly6C-APC (Biolegend, 128015, HK1.4), rat anti-mouse/human CD11b-APC/Cy7 (Biolegend, 101225, M1/70), rat anti-mouse CD11c-PE/Dazzle (Biolegend, 117347, N418), rat anti-mouse/human CD11b-APC (Biolegend, 101212, M1/70), rat anti-mouse MHCII-APC/Cy7 (Biolegend, 107627, M5/114.15.2), rat anti-mouse F4/80-APC (Biolegend, 123116, BM8), rat anti-mouse NK1.1-APC/Cy7 (Biolegend, 108723, PK136), armenian hamster anti-mouse Cxcr3-APC (Biolegend, 126511, Cxcr3-173). Following staining, cells were washed in Cell Staining Buffer and then resuspended in Cell Staining Buffer, and finally run on either a BD Biosciences FACSAria III, BD LSRFortessa X-20, or Beckman Coulter FC500.
For CyTOF experiments, brain-derived cells were prepared in a manner identical to that of their preparation for scRNA-seq through the Percoll gradient centrifugation step. Following gradient centrifugation, three brains were pooled together to comprise a single CyTOF sample and cells were washed and resuspended in Maxpar PBS (Fluidigm, 201058). Dead cells were labeled by incubation with 0.75 μM Cell-ID Cisplatin (Fluidigm, 201064) for 5 minutes and then washed in Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer (Fluidigm, 201068). FC receptors were blocked by incubation with TruStain fcX in 100 μL MaxPar Cell Staining Buffer for 30 min at RT. Cells were washed and then stained with a cocktail of metal-conjugated antibodies at RT for 30 minutes and then washed in MaxPar Cell Staining Buffer. Optimal concentrations were determined for each antibody by titration. The following pre-conjugated antibodies purchased from Fluidigm were used in this study: CD45-089Y (3089005B, 30-F11); Ly-6G-141Pr (3141008B, 1A8,); CD11c-142Nd (3142003B, N418); CD45R-144Nd (3144011B, RA3-6B2); CD4-145Nd (3145002B, RM4-5); CD11b-148Nd (3148003B, M1/70); CD44-150Nd (3150018B, IM7); CD25-151Eu (3151007B, 3C7); CD3e-152Sm (3152004B, 145-2C11); PD-L1-153Eu (3153016B, 10F.9G2); CTLA-4-154Sm (3154008B, UC10-4B9); PD-1-159Tb (3159024B, 29F.1A12); Ly-6C-162Dy (3162014B, HK1.4); CX3CR1-164Dy (3164023B, SA011F11); NK1.1-165Ho (3165018B, PK136); ckit-166Er (3166004B, 2B8); CD8a-168Er (3168003B, 53-6.7); CD86-172Yb (3172016B, GL1); I-A/I-E-209Bi (3209006B, M5/114.15.2). Cells were resuspended and fixed in 1.6% PFA prepared in MaxPar PBS for 20 minutes and then washed in MaxPar PBS. Nuclei were labeled by incubating fixed cells in 1:4000 Cell-ID Intercalator (Fluidigm, 201192B) dissolved in MaxPar Fix and Perm Buffer (Fluidigm, 201067) for 1h or overnight at 4C. Following nuclear labeling, cells were washed once in MaxPar Cell Staining Buffer and twice in MaxPar Water (Fluidigm, 201069). Samples were brought to 500,000 particulates/mL in MilliQ water containing 0.1x EQ beads (Fluidigm, 201078) and run in 450 μL injections on a CyTOF2 instrument.
For CITE-seq experiments, brain-derived cells were prepared in a manner identical to that of their preparation for scRNA-seq through the Percoll gradient centrifugation step. Following gradient centrifugation, samples were prepared for 10X Genomics Chromium (10X Genomics, PN-120223) as described in the CITE-seq and cell hashing protocol on the CITE-seq website ( https://citeseq.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cite-seq_and_hashing_protocol_190213.pdf ). Briefly, samples were blocked by incubation with TruStain fcX in 50 μL cell staining buffer for 20 minutes on ice.

After 25 minutes of staining, samples were washed 4 times prior to loading on to the 10x Chromium.
Tissue clearing was performed as previously described ( Guldner et al., 2016 16. Guldner, I.H. ∙ Yang, L. ∙ Cowdrick, K.R. ... An Integrative Platform for Three-dimensional Quantitative Analysis of Spatially Heterogeneous Metastasis Landscapes Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :24201 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, tissues were collected as described above and were incubated in 4% PFA overnight at 4C. The next morning, the tissue sample was rinsed 3 times with 1x PBS, sliced into ∼200 μm sagittal sections, and then incubated in CUBIC1 (35% water; 25% urea; 25% N,N,N’,N’-Tetrakis(2-hydroxyproply)ethyl-enediamine [Alfa Aesar, L16280-AP], 99%; 15% triton-X) for a minimum of 3 days at 37C with gentle rotating. Following CUBIC1 incubation until the tissue was transparent to the eye, the sample was washed with multiple changes of 1x PBS over 24h at RT with gentle rotating. The sample was then incubated in 6 μL DAPI:2mL 1x PBS for up to 24h at RT with gentle rotating. The DAPI-stained sample was washed for ∼8h with 1x PBS at RT with gentle rotating. Finally, the tissue was incubated in CUBIC2 (50% sucrose; 25% urea; 15% water; 10% Triethanolamine[JT Baker, 02-004-534]) for a minimum of 1 day at RT before being imaged. CUBIC reagents were prepared as described in the original CUBIC protocol ( Susaki et al., 2014 50. Susaki, E.A. ∙ Tainaka, K. ∙ Perrin, D. ... Whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution using chemical cocktails and computational analysis Cell. 2014; 157 :726-739 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (932) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Deep tissue imaging was performed on either an Olympus FV1000 or a Caliber ID RS-G4. While using the Olympus FV1000, either the confocal or two photon setting was used depending on which setting optimally excited the fluorophores present in the sample. On the Olympus FV1000, BrightZ setting was applied to increase signal as deeper areas of the sample were imaged. In all cases, a 25x objective (XLSLPLN25XGMP, Olympus USA; NA = 1.0 and WD = 8 mm) was used on the Olympus FV1000. The Olympus FV1000 was equipped with filter set (460–500, 520–560, 525–625, 650–700 nm) and a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai DeepSee 690–1040 nm, Spectra-Physics). For the Caliber ID RS-G4, all images were acquired with a 20x objective. Imaging of 2D tissue slides was performed on an Olympus BX43 upright microscope for non-fluorescent histology and a Leica DM550 B inverted microscope for fluorescent histology. Gross imaging of whole brains was captured on a Leica M165 FC fluorescence stereoscope.
For immunofluorescence (IF), tissues were adhered to SuperFrost slides (VWR, 48311-703) and deparaffinized with two xylene washes. Tissue was rehydrated by washes with 100%, 90%, and 80% ethanol and ddH 2 O. Antigens were unmasked by boiling slides in 1x sodium citrate solution (2.94 g sodium citrate trisodium salt dehydrate in 1L ddH 2 O, pH 6.0) either in a pressure cooker for approximately 20 minutes or in a beaker in a microwave for 10 minutes. Following antigen retrieval, tissues were blocked with 5% goat serum in TBST for one hour at RT, and then stained with primary antibody overnight in a humidifying chamber at 4C. Antibodies used for IF include: rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako, polyclonal, 019-19741), rabbit anti-TMEM119 (Abcam, 28-3, Ab209064), guinea pig anti-TMEM119 (Synaptic Systems, polyclonal, 400-004), mouse anti-mCherry (Clontech, monoclonal, 632543), rabbit anti-CD3 (Abcam, SP7, ab16669), rabbit anti-CD86 (Cell Signaling Technologies, E5W6H; CST; 19589), rabbit anti-VISTA (Cell Signaling Technologies, D5L5T; CST; 54979). After overnight primary antibody incubation, slides were washed three times with TBST, and then incubated in secondary antibody for three hours in a humidifying chamber at RT. Secondary antibodies used include: Alexa Fluor 488 AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG, Fc fragment specific (Jackson Immuno Research, 111-545-008); Alexa Fluor 594 AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG, Fcγ fragment specific (Jackson Immuno Research, 115-585-008); Alexa Fluor 488 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research, 711-545-152); Donkey anti-Goat IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, A-21432); Alexa Fluor 594 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Guinea Pig IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research, 706-585-148). After secondary antibody incubation, slides were rinsed three times with TBST, stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, D1306), rinsed three times with TBST, and then mounted with Fluoromount G slide mounting media (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 17984-25). For DAB-based immunohistochemistry, samples were prepared similar to IF through antigen retrieval. After antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide in tap water for 10 minutes. Next, samples were stained with the Vectastain Elite ABC-HRP Kit RTU (Vector Laboratories, PK-7200) per kit protocol. Primary antibodies used include: rabbit Ki-67 (Cell Signaling Technology, D3B5, 12202S). ImmPACT DAB (Vector Laboratories, SK-4105) was used as the peroxidase substrate and incubated on tissue until color developed (∼30 s).
Tissue sections were prepared using the RNAscope 2.5 manual assay following the manufacturer’s protocol for sample preparation and pretreatment (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Document Number: 322452) and RNAscope 2.5 HD detection (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Document Number: 322360-USM) with minor modifications. Modifications of the protocol include: extended tissue rehydration gradient; extension of boiling in target retrieval buffer to 20 minutes total, and omitting the Protease Plus incubation. Briefly, sample preparation and pretreatment included deparaffinization and rehydration, endogenous peroxidases quenching with RNAscope Hydrogen Peroxide (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 322335), and targets retrieval by boiling in RNA Scope Target Retrieval Agent (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 322000). Next, probes were hybridized in HybEZ Oven (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 310010). Probes used include mouse P2ry12 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 317601), mouse Il1b (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 316891), mouse Ybx3 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 538121), mouse Cxcl10 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 408921), and human Cxcl10 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 311851). Amplifiers were hybridized and signal was detected using amplifiers and Fast Red reagents provided in RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection – RED kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 322360). Washes between each step were performed with RNAscope Wash Buffer (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 310091). To co-immunostain with ISH, following signal detection, samples were treated identically to IF samples starting with blocking in 5% goat serum.
For CITE-seq experiments, 10x Genomics Chromium (10x Genomics, PN-120223) was used for single cell capture, cDNA libraries were prepared according to the standard CITE-seq ( https://citeseq.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cite-seq_and_hashing_protocol_190213.pdf ) and 10x Genomics standard protocols. Kits necessary for library preparation included Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, PN-10000092); Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM Library and Gel Bead Kit v3.1 (10x Genomics, PN-1000121); Chromium Chip B Single Cell Kit (10x Genomics, PN-1000074); Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (10x Genomics, PN-120262).

The resulting ADT-/HTO-derived and mRNA-derived cDNA libraries were pooled and sequenced. 26 bp of cell barcode and UMI sequences and 91 bp RNA reads were generated with Illumina NovaSeq 6000.
For studies examining CD86 and VISTA spatial distribution, we first utilized an established method ( He et al., 2019 20. He, D. ∙ Cai, D. ∙ Zhou, J. ... Adaptive Weighting Depth-variant Deconvolution of Fluorescence Microscopy Images with Convolutional Neural Network ArXiv. 2019; 1907.03217 Google Scholar ) to eliminate the noise in the images, then the pixel-level segmentation results were achieved by taking thresholds on the denoised images. Next, clustered nuclei were identified based on DBSCAN (Ester et al.) as the tumor regions, and the distal regions were defined as the regions which are 10+ μm away from the tumor regions. The pixel-level segmentation results along with the identified tumor and naive regions were reviewed by experts to ensure correctness.
All 3D image data was visualized using the volume or surfaces tool in Imaris software (Bitplane). For 3D image dataset processing, briefly, in the first step, we conducted image segmentation of tumors and microglia in 3D image stacks using the U-Net model ( Ronneberger et al., 2015 43. Ronneberger, O. ∙ Fischer, P. ∙ Brox, T. U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation Navab, N. ∙ Hornegger, J. ∙ Wells, W.M. ... (Editors) Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2015 Springer International Publishing, 2015; 234-241 Crossref Scopus (54939) Google Scholar ). To ensure segmentation accuracy, we selected and annotated the most representative 2D image slices in every 3D image and used the annotated 2D slices to train the U-Net model. Our training dataset contained 53 2D slices for glia cells and 98 slices for tumors. The U-Net segmentation produced voxel-level segmentation but did not group cell voxels into individual cells. To further acquire accurate instance-level segmentation of glial cells, we applied the method as previously described, based on the k-terminal cut algorithm ( Yang et al., 2016 57. Yang, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Guldner, I.H. ... 3D Segmentation of Glial Cells Using Fully Convolutional Networks and k-Terminal Cut Ourselin, S. ∙ Joskowicz, L. ∙ Sabuncu, M.R. ... (Editors) Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2016 Springer International Publishing, 2016; 658-666 Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar ), to disentangle connected glial cells in the U-Net segmentation into individual cells. Finally, all the results thus computed were verified by human experts to ensure correctness.
MATLAB (Mathworks) was used to extract eight morphological features of each segmented microglia cell presented in Figure 1 . Features were correlated with the distances between microglia and tumors. These distances were defined as the distances between the cell centers (the geometric center of each segmented cell body) and the tumor boundaries and were computed by the knn search function in MATLAB. Microglia cell bodies, protrusions, and total volumes were computed by multiplying the total number of voxels in each segmented cell by the voxel volume. The roundness of the microglia cell bodies was computed using MitoLoc ( Vowinckel et al., 2015 52. Vowinckel, J. ∙ Hartl, J. ∙ Butler, R. ... MitoLoc: A method for the simultaneous quantification of mitochondrial network morphology and membrane potential in single cells Mitochondrion. 2015; 24 :77-86 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). The microglia cell density was estimated by the distance between each target microglia cell and its nearest neighboring microglia cell (as presented as distance to nearest neighbor in main figure), and alternatively by counting the numbers of the microglia cell bodies in 80 μm x 80 μm x 80 μm cubes (as presented in supplemental figure). To quantitatively analyze microglia protrusions, we modeled each segmented microglia as a 3D grid graph and computed the shortest path tree from the cell center in this graph and then extracted protrusion tips by finding the voxels with the local maximal distances. To reduce false positives in our detection, we removed all the detected protrusion tips that were within 5 voxels to another longer protrusion. After that, the number of protrusions was computed as the number of protrusion tips and the lengths of protrusions were computed as the lengths of the shortest paths from the cell center to the protrusion tips along the graph. Finally, the average width of protrusions was computed by dividing the protrusion volume with the total protrusion length.
To assign morphology scores, seven numeric features were measured to describe each cell. Six of these features (that is, all features except roundness) have heavily right-skewed distributions and thus were log( x +1) transformed. Further, many of these features are correlated, and thus principal component analysis was applied to create independent features. The first four principal components explain 99% of the variance in the data. Projecting data to these principal component directions, we have found that while the cells show no groupings in principal components 2 or 4, they form two distinct clusters in the space spanned by principal components 1 and 3, and these two clusters can be well separated by a straight line. Then a score was given to each cell. The size of the score was proportional to its distance to the separation line, and the sign of the score was determined by the side of the separation line the cell is on, which is positive for cancer-like cells and negative for non-cancer-like cells. Finally, the positive scores were scaled to range from 0 to 1, and the negative scores were scaled to range from −1 to 0. Differences in morphological features were analyzed for statistical significance using a two-tailed Student’s t test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 3D image data analysis was performed blinded.
In analyses examining cell number after cell CNS native myeloid or BMDM depletion, CD3+ T cell numbers with dual immune checkpoint therapy, or CD3+ T cell spatial localization and contact with Iba1 + myeloid cells, numbers of cells were counted either by using particle tool in ImageJ or FIJI or manual counting in ImageJ or FIJI ( Schindelin et al., 2012 46. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat.

NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (43944) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ki67 was assessed manually by performing an H-score. In all cases, statistical significance was assessed by using a two-tailed Student’s t test and performed and visualized using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 2D image data image analysis related to CCR2 experiments, CD86 IF, and VISTA IF were performed blinded, while all other 2D image data was not performed blinded.
mCherry+ br-mets were counted manually immediately upon extraction of brain from mice underneath a fluorescence stereo microscope. Metastasis size was quantified from fluorescent gross brain images by manually encircling metastases from a dorsal view of the brain in ImageJ or FIJI and subsequently using the analyze – measure command. Metastasis number and size were analyzed for statistical significance using a two-tailed Student’s t test or, when appropriate, two-tailed paired Student’s t test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed and visualized using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). Br-met counts were not performed blinded.
Flow cytometry and CyTOF data were gated, analyzed, and visualized using FlowJo software (BD) or Cytobank Premium (Beckman Coulter). Gating strategies are provided in main and supplemental figures of this paper. Cytobank applies the Barnes-Hut implementation of tSNE. Detailed descriptions of dimensionality reduction methods (viSNE and SPADE) applied by Cytobank, as well as references to the original publications establishing these methods, can be found at: https://support.cytobank.org/hc/en-us . Flow cytometry and CyTOF data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t test. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed and visualized using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). Flow cytometry and CyTOF analysis was not performed blinded.
The raw base sequence calls generated from the sequencer were demultiplexed into sample-specific mRNA, ADT, and HTO FASTQ files with bcl2fastq through CellRanger 3.1.0 (10x Genomics). Raw FASTQ files were processed using Cellranger 3.1.0. We performed most filtering/normalization/scaling and dimensional reduction, clustering, and differential expression analyses using the R Studio and R package Seurat_3.1.1 ( Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996 22.

First, samples were demultiplexed into their sample of origin by the HTODemux command, which also removes multiplets. Next, RNA expression matrices were normalized and scaled using the SCTransform wrapper in Seurat. Low quality cells were filtered from the data by regressing on percent of mitochondria genes in this step. Normalized, scaled, and filtered data was then analyzed for significant principal components, underwent UMAP or tSNE dimensional reduction analysis, clustered, and analyzed for differentially expressed genes using Seruat. Inner workings of Seurat, including dimensionality reduction techniques, can be found on the following websites: https://rdrr.io/cran/Seurat/ and https://satijalab.org/seurat/ .

IBA1+ myeloid cells in each dataset were first identified as microglia (TREM2+, HEXB+, and/or JUN+ and ITGA4- and CCR2-) or BMDM (ITGA4+ and/or CCR2+). These genes were selected for identifying microglia and BMDM based on canonical definitions and because reads for these genes were present across all datasets. Microglia were used for further analysis as BMDM were too low in abundance across datasets for analysis. Individual patient datasets (6 total; 3 metastasis, 3 naive) were combined and analyzed as one combined object in Seurat. Prior to differential gene expression analyses, technical variation was removed with Seurat’s sctransform wrapper. All human data was analyzed by Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Adjusted p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Human CyTOF data was derived from a previous publication ( Friebel et al., 2020 13. Friebel, E. ∙ Kapolou, K. ∙ Unger, S. ...

Data were uploaded to FlowJo and gated on singlets and live cells before immune cell gating, as described in Figure S2 E. Proportions were derived by dividing the number of cells within the indicated population by all identified immune cells within the sample. Human scRNA-seq and CyTOF data were not analyzed blinded.
