Title: Noninvasive Early Identification of Therapeutic Benefit from Immune Checkpoint Inhibition


Abstract: Summary

Although treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can produce remarkably durable responses, most patients develop early disease progression. Furthermore, initial response assessment by conventional imaging is often unable to identify which patients will achieve durable clinical benefit (DCB). Here, we demonstrate that pre-treatment circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral CD8 T cell levels are independently associated with DCB. We further show that ctDNA dynamics after a single infusion can aid in identification of patients who will achieve DCB. Integrating these determinants, we developed and validated an entirely noninvasive multiparameter assay (DIREct-On, Durable Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling and ctDNA-On-treatment) that robustly predicts which patients will achieve DCB with higher accuracy than any individual feature. Taken together, these results demonstrate that integrated ctDNA and circulating immune cell profiling can provide accurate, noninvasive, and early forecasting of ultimate outcomes for NSCLC patients receiving ICIs.

Section: Introduction

Antibody-based blockade of programmed death 1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-[L]1) signaling has shown remarkable promise for treatment of advanced non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) ( Reck et al., 2016 36. Reck, M. ∙ Rodríguez-Abreu, D. ∙ Robinson, A.G. ..., KEYNOTE-024 Investigators Pembrolizumab versus Chemotherapy for PD-L1-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer N. Engl. J.

Med. 2018; 378 :2288-2301 Crossref Scopus (2791) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clinical trials combining PD-(L)1 blockade with cytotoxic therapy or with other immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) strategies have shown higher response rates at the risk of higher toxicity ( Gandhi et al., 2018 13. Gandhi, L. ∙ Rodríguez-Abreu, D. ∙ Gadgeel, S. ..., KEYNOTE-189 Investigators Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy in Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer N. Engl. J.

Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab in Lung Cancer with a High Tumor Mutational Burden N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :2093-2104 Crossref Scopus (2384) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, only a minority of patients achieve durable benefit from ICI and reliable biomarkers that can accurately identify these patients before or early during treatment have thus far remained elusive ( Camidge et al., 2019 4. Camidge, D.R. ∙ Doebele, R.C. ∙ Kerr, K.M. Comparing and contrasting predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy and targeted therapy of NSCLC Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2019; 16 :341-355 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). The most heavily studied biomarkers for predicting response to PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI prior to therapy include assessment of tumor PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) ( Cristescu et al., 2018 9. Cristescu, R. ∙ Mogg, R. ∙ Ayers, M. ...

Med. 2016; 375 :1823-1833 Crossref Scopus (7633) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, PD-L1 has several major shortcomings as a predictive biomarker of durable benefit while TMB is continuing to be evaluated clinically ( Camidge et al., 2019 4. Camidge, D.R. ∙ Doebele, R.C. ∙ Kerr, K.M. Comparing and contrasting predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy and targeted therapy of NSCLC Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2019; 16 :341-355 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cristescu et al., 2018 9. Cristescu, R. ∙ Mogg, R. ∙ Ayers, M. ... Pan-tumor genomic biomarkers for PD-1 checkpoint blockade–based immunotherapy Science. 2018; 362 :eaar3593 Crossref Scopus (1520) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rizvi et al., 2018 38. Rizvi, H. ∙ Sanchez-Vega, F. ∙ La, K. ... Molecular Determinants of Response to Anti-Programmed Cell Death (PD)-1 and Anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Blockade in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Profiled With Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing J. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 36 :633-641 Crossref Scopus (1044) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The current practice in the US for front-line therapy of advanced, driver mutation-negative NSCLC is to treat patients with PD-L1 ≤49% (percentage of PD-L1 + tumor cells by immunohistochemistry) with concurrent chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab and those with PD-L1 ≥50% with pembrolizumab alone or with concurrent chemotherapy ( Hanna et al., 2020 16. Hanna, N.H. ∙ Schneider, B.J. ∙ Temin, S. ... Therapy for Stage IV Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Without Driver Alterations: ASCO and OH (CCO) Joint Guideline Update J. Clin. Oncol. 2020; 38 :1608-1632 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a subset of patients whose tumors have ≤49% PD-L1 staining can respond to immunotherapy alone. For example, the KEYNOTE-042 trial that compared pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in advanced non-squamous NSCLC demonstrated that pembrolizumab alone had an objective response rate of 16% in patients with PD-L1 1%–49%, comprising of 32% of all objective responses observed ( Mok et al., 2019 29. Mok, T.S.K. ∙ Wu, Y.L. ∙ Kudaba, I. ..., KEYNOTE-042 Investigators Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for previously untreated, PD-L1-expressing, locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (KEYNOTE-042): a randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 3 trial Lancet. 2019; 393 :1819-1830 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2393) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, PD-L1 staining alone is not sufficiently accurate to identify all potential responders to PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI in NSCLC.
In the search for better biomarkers to predict which patients will respond to immunotherapy, several groups have recently demonstrated that multivariable models based on molecular analyses of tumor biopsy tissue collected prior to treatment can predict response to ICI ( Anagnostou et al., 2020 2. Anagnostou, V. ∙ Niknafs, N. ∙ Marrone, K. ... Multimodal genomic features predict outcome of immune checkpoint blockade in non-small-cell lung cancer Nat.

Jiang, P. ∙ Gu, S. ∙ Pan, D. ... Signatures of T cell dysfunction and exclusion predict cancer immunotherapy response Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1550-1558 Crossref Scopus (2802) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each of these methods achieves modest improvement for predicting benefit (area under the curve, [AUC] = 0.7–0.8) over PD-L1 expression (AUC = 0.6–0.7) ( Mok et al., 2019 29. Mok, T.S.K. ∙ Wu, Y.L. ∙ Kudaba, I. ..., KEYNOTE-042 Investigators Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for previously untreated, PD-L1-expressing, locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (KEYNOTE-042): a randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 3 trial Lancet. 2019; 393 :1819-1830 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2393) PubMed Google Scholar ) or TMB alone (AUC = 0.6–0.7) ( Rizvi et al., 2018 38. Rizvi, H. ∙ Sanchez-Vega, F. ∙ La, K. ... Molecular Determinants of Response to Anti-Programmed Cell Death (PD)-1 and Anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Blockade in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Profiled With Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing J. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 36 :633-641 Crossref Scopus (1044) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, the requirement for tumor tissue can be problematic in advanced NSCLC, where obtaining sufficient tissue for molecular analysis is not possible in a substantial subset of patients ( Green et al., 2014 15. Green, M.R. ∙ Willey, J. ∙ Buettner, A. ... Molecular testing prior to first-line therapy in patients with stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): A survey of U.S. medical oncologists J. Clin. Oncol. 2014; 32 :8097 8097 Crossref Google Scholar ; Lim et al., 2015 26. Lim, C. ∙ Tsao, M.S. ∙ Le, L.W. ... Biomarker testing and time to treatment decision in patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer Ann. Oncol. 2015; 26 :1415-1421 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reliance on single biopsy specimens also risks confounding of biomarker results due to intra-tumoral heterogeneity or low tumor content, leading to lower than desired inter-observer concordance ( Camidge et al., 2019 4. Camidge, D.R. ∙ Doebele, R.C. ∙ Kerr, K.M. Comparing and contrasting predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy and targeted therapy of NSCLC Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2019; 16 :341-355 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A separate approach for predicting ultimate clinical benefit of ICI would be early response assessment. Clinically, response is currently evaluated by conventional imaging, usually performed 6–12 weeks after treatment start. To assess how accurately the first on-treatment imaging study identifies which patients ultimately achieve long-lasting clinical benefit from ICI, we analyzed response data from 273 NSCLC patients receiving PD-(L)1-based ICI (αPD-(L)1, 75%; αPD-1+chemotherapy, 13%; αPD-(L)1+αCTLA-4, 12%). Strikingly, we found that among patients achieving stable disease (SD, n = 112) at the first scan, about half (51%; n = 57) did not ultimately achieve durable clinical benefit (DCB), defined as progression-free survival (PFS) of at least 6 months ( Figure 1 A) ( Rizvi et al., 2015 37. Rizvi, N.A. ∙ Hellmann, M.D. ∙ Snyder, A. ... Mutational landscape determines sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer Science. 2015; 348 :124-128 Crossref Scopus (6353) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed similar ultimate outcomes after initial stable scans irrespective of PD-(L)1 blockade-based therapy regimen ( Figure S1 A). Further, 39% of patients (35/90) who achieved SD as their best overall response ultimately experienced DCB, suggesting objective responses assessed by imaging are not fully capturing patients that are benefitting. Therefore, there is considerable unmet need for early response assessment methods that more accurately identify who will achieve DCB or NDB.
One such potential approach is comparison of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels before and after the start of treatment to assess treatment response. Indeed, several recent publications have demonstrated that ctDNA changes 4–8 weeks after therapy initiation can classify response to ICI in NSCLC with modest accuracy (AUC = 0.65–0.75) ( Anagnostou et al., 2019 1. Anagnostou, V. ∙ Forde, P.M. ∙ White, J.R. ... Dynamics of Tumor and Immune Responses during Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cancer Res. 2019; 79 :1214-1225 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Goldberg et al., 2018 14. Goldberg, S.B. ∙ Narayan, A. ∙ Kole, A.J. ... Early Assessment of Lung Cancer Immunotherapy Response via Circulating Tumor DNA Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :1872-1880 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raja et al., 2018 35. Raja, R. ∙ Kuziora, M. ∙ Brohawn, P.Z. ... Early Reduction in ctDNA Predicts Survival in Patients with Lung and Bladder Cancer Treated with Durvalumab Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :6212-6222 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each of these studies used a different ctDNA change threshold and time point to assess molecular responses, leaving questions about the optimal approach. Furthermore, even earlier classification of ultimate clinical benefit is desirable to improve personalized medicine approaches.
We therefore set out to develop a noninvasive approach for early identification of which advanced NSCLC patients will achieve DCB upon treatment with PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI. We hypothesized that both tumor and immune factors can contribute to PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI outcome prediction and can be measured noninvasively. Specifically, we integrated ctDNA profiling, which measures tumor properties, and analysis of circulating immune cells, which reflect the immune milieu, using pre- and early on-treatment blood samples. To combine these factors into a single biomarker, we applied a Bayesian framework for integrating diverse risk predictors that we recently demonstrated has significant advantages compare to Cox models for time-dependent biomarker development ( Kurtz et al., 2019 23. Kurtz, D.M. ∙ Esfahani, M.S. ∙ Scherer, F. ... Dynamic Risk Profiling Using Serial Tumor Biomarkers for Personalized Outcome Prediction Cell. 2019; 178 :699-713.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using a discovery and validation approach, we demonstrate that integration of tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic features assessable from noninvasive blood draws can robustly identify which NSCLC patients will achieve DCB from ICI.

Section: Results

To develop a multiparameter biomarker for predicting clinical benefit from ICIs in NSCLC, we assembled a cohort of 99 advanced NSCLC patients that received PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI. Tumors were characterized for PD-L1 expression, and we analyzed ctDNA in pre-treatment plasma specimens using cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) ( Figure 1 B; Tables S1 and S2 ) ( Chabon et al., 2020 6.

Integrated digital error suppression for improved detection of circulating tumor DNA Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :547-555 Crossref Scopus (762) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed CAPP-Seq on both cell-free DNA from plasma and cellular DNA from leukocytes to enable censoring of clonal hematopoiesis variants (see STAR Methods ). To investigate the ability of circulating leukocyte profiles to predict ICI response, we also profiled available pre-treatment blood specimens for leukocyte immune composition using CIBERSORT ( Newman et al., 2015 31.

Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :773-782 Crossref Scopus (2048) PubMed Google Scholar ), flow cytometry, or both. Last, we performed CAPP-Seq ctDNA analysis on early on-treatment plasma samples to allow incorporation of ctDNA responses. Of the 99 patients, 94 had detectable pre-treatment ctDNA by CAPP-Seq (95%, Tables S3 and S4 ). These 94 patients were split into 3 groups for downstream analyses: (1) 22 patients who did not have early on-treatment plasma samples or material for immune profiling available and were therefore only informative as part of feature-discovery analyses, (2) 34 patients who had all necessary samples (pre-treatment plasma, pre-treatment leukocytes, and early on-treatment plasma) and were used to train the multiparameter model (“DIREct Discovery Cohort”), and (3) 38 patients that had all necessary samples and constituted the DIREct Validation Cohort. The latter were held out from all analyses until utilized for validation of findings from (1) and (2) ( Figure S1 B).
Responses induced by ICI and their durability are known to be influenced both by the burden of mutations as neoantigenic substrates for immune recognition as captured by TMB ( Mandal et al., 2019 27.

Prior studies have demonstrated that tissue-based TMB can be noninvasively estimated from ctDNA using sequencing panels of various sizes, as might be useful for predicting response to ICI ( Chaudhuri et al., 2017 7. Chaudhuri, A.A. ∙ Chabon, J.J. ∙ Lovejoy, A.F. ...

Gandara, D.R. ∙ Paul, S.M. ∙ Kowanetz, M. ... Blood-based tumor mutational burden as a predictor of clinical benefit in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with atezolizumab Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1441-1448 Crossref Scopus (893) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 44. Wang, Z. ∙ Duan, J. ∙ Cai, S. ...

To explore this further, we began by analyzing data from a recently published study of 853 advanced NSCLC patients treated with either the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab (POPLAR/OAK ICI Cohort, n = 429) or chemotherapy (POPLAR/OAK Chemo Cohort, n = 424) and examined whether ctDNA metrics and PD-L1 expression could accurately classify DCB versus NDB ( Figure S1 C) ( Gandara et al., 2018 12. Gandara, D.R. ∙ Paul, S.M. ∙ Kowanetz, M. ... Blood-based tumor mutational burden as a predictor of clinical benefit in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with atezolizumab Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1441-1448 Crossref Scopus (893) PubMed Google Scholar ). While high bTMB (≥14 mutations per megabase) was significantly associated with durable benefit from ICI, we found the strength of this association to be modest ( Figures 2 A and 2D). Separately, we reasoned that pre-treatment ctDNA concentration may be associated with treatment benefit since it is a surrogate for total-body disease burden ( Chaudhuri et al., 2017 7. Chaudhuri, A.A. ∙ Chabon, J.J. ∙ Lovejoy, A.F. ... Early Detection of Molecular Residual Disease in Localized Lung Cancer by Circulating Tumor DNA Profiling Cancer Discov. 2017; 7 :1394-1403 Crossref Scopus (675) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ito et al., 2019 19. Ito, K. ∙ Schöder, H. ∙ Teng, R. ... Prognostic value of baseline metabolic tumor volume measured on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab therapy Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging. 2019; 46 :930-939 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, patients ultimately achieving DCB had significantly lower ctDNA levels prior to ICI therapy ( Figures 2 B and 2D). Furthermore, since these two blood-based measurements had reciprocal associations with DCB, we used their ratio to integrate them as ctDNA-normalized bTMB (normalized bTMB). Patients achieving DCB from ICI had significantly higher normalized bTMB ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Accordingly, ICI-treated patients with higher normalized bTMB had significantly better ultimate clinical outcomes ( Figure 2 E, P = 0.001, PFS hazard ratio [HR] = 1.46). Moreover, when comparing hazard ratios of normalized bTMB to either bTMB or ctDNA alone, we find that normalized bTMB is superior to both individual metrics in ICI-treated patients ( Figure S2 C).
To assess whether normalized bTMB was predictive of durable benefit specifically for ICI, we separately analyzed its relationship to outcomes in patients who received chemotherapy alone ( Figures 2 F–2I). Interestingly, in chemotherapy-treated patients, lower bTMB and lower ctDNA burden were individually associated with higher likelihood of DCB, such that normalized bTMB was not associated with outcome in the absence of ICI ( P = 0.88, Figures 2 F–2I). As expected, tumor PD-L1 expression was also associated with DCB only in the setting of ICI ( P < 0.01 for ICI; P = 0.41 for chemotherapy). Therefore, while ctDNA and bTMB were associated with outcomes in patients treated with either ICI or chemotherapy, ctDNA normalized bTMB was only predictive in the context of ICI.
Next, we tested the validity of the association of ctDNA concentration and normalized bTMB with ultimate outcomes in response to single-agent PD-L1 blockade using an independent cohort of patients newly profiled in this study. We first determined the relationship between TMB measured in cell-free DNA by CAPP-Seq and tumor TMB measured by whole-exome sequencing using matched tissue samples ( Figures S2 A and S2B). In patients treated with single-agent PD-(L)1 blockade, the associations between clinical benefit and ctDNA concentration or normalized bTMB in our cases mirrored those observed in the POPLAR/OAK ICI Cohort ( Figures S2 D–S2G). Utilizing the normalized bTMB threshold defined in the POPLAR/OAK ICI Cohort to stratify patients in the validation cohort, patients with high normalized bTMB had significantly better outcomes ( Figure 2 J, P = 0.002, PFS HR = 3.54). Collectively, these data suggest that pre-treatment normalized bTMB can noninvasively identify patients most likely to experience durable benefit in response to ICI. However, nearly one-third of patients were misclassified using normalized bTMB alone: ∼25% of patients predicted to have NDB nevertheless achieved PFS ≥6 months, and conversely, ∼40% of patients predicted to have DCB had PFS <6 months. This suggests that further improvement in predictive accuracy would be desirable.
We therefore explored other biomarkers as potential determinants of durable benefit from ICI. Specifically, we reasoned that the frequency and representation of circulating leukocyte subsets might vary between patients achieving or failing to achieve DCB from ICI. We therefore profiled leukocyte transcriptomes in patients with available specimens (excluding the DIREct Validation Cohort, Figure S1 B) using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and applied CIBERSORTx ( Newman et al., 2015 31. Newman, A.M. ∙ Liu, C.L. ∙ Green, M.R. ... Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :453-457 Crossref Scopus (7546) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 33. Newman, A.M. ∙ Steen, C.B. ∙ Liu, C.L. ... Determining cell type abundance and expression from bulk tissues with digital cytometry Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :773-782 Crossref Scopus (2048) PubMed Google Scholar ) to quantify the relative proportions of major leukocyte subpopulations ( Tables S5 and S6 ). We confirmed highly correlated composition estimates of leukocyte composition, whether using RNA-seq deconvolution or conventional flow cytometric immunophenotyping ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Interestingly, we observed fewer circulating CD8 T cells prior to ICI therapy in patients ultimately achieving DCB—while no other cell type was significantly associated with clinical benefit ( Figures 3 A and 3B; Figure S3 C). Indeed, CD8 T cell levels alone had comparable classification accuracy for predicting durable benefit (accuracy = 70%), compared to other pre-treatment features including PD-L1 and normalized bTMB ( Figure 3 C). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in pre-treatment circulating CD8 T cell fractions based on prior receipt of chemotherapy, radiation, or corticosteroids (data not shown). Of note, none of the three pre-treatment biomarkers were correlated with each other, suggesting that they are independent and might therefore be useful in the context of a multiparameter predictor of ICI benefit ( Figure S3 D).
Recent studies have reported that ctDNA responses within 4–8 weeks after starting ICI correlate with best radiographic responses and modestly with DCB ( Anagnostou et al., 2019 1. Anagnostou, V. ∙ Forde, P.M. ∙ White, J.R. ... Dynamics of Tumor and Immune Responses during Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cancer Res. 2019; 79 :1214-1225 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Goldberg et al., 2018 14. Goldberg, S.B. ∙ Narayan, A. ∙ Kole, A.J. ... Early Assessment of Lung Cancer Immunotherapy Response via Circulating Tumor DNA Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :1872-1880 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raja et al., 2018 35. Raja, R. ∙ Kuziora, M. ∙ Brohawn, P.Z. ... Early Reduction in ctDNA Predicts Survival in Patients with Lung and Bladder Cancer Treated with Durvalumab Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :6212-6222 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore explored whether ctDNA kinetics within 4 weeks of starting treatment could help determine likelihood of durable benefit from ICI. We measured post-treatment ctDNA responses early after ICI therapy initiation in 46 patients with available samples (excluding the DIREct Validation Cohort, Figure S1 B) with detectable ctDNA at baseline ( Tables S3 and S4 ). The median time of blood collection from treatment start was 2.4 weeks and 98% (n = 45) of patients had the sample collected after only a single cycle of ICI. Based on a prior study of intra-day ctDNA variation in untreated advanced NSCLC, we defined a threshold of 50% decrease in ctDNA concentration from pre-treatment as a “ctDNA molecular response” ( Wang et al., 2017 43. Wang, J. ∙ Bai, H. ∙ Hong, C. ... Analyzing epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status changes in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer at different sampling time-points of blood within one day Thorac. Cancer. 2017; 8 :312-319 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even at these early time points, ctDNA levels showed significant changes compared to baseline in most patients ( Figure 3 D). ctDNA burden dropped in 59% of patients achieving DCB while it did not meet the 0.5-fold threshold in 95% of NDB patients ( P < 0.0001; Figures 3 D and 3E). Strikingly, ctDNA responses after a single cycle of ICI therapy distinguished the majority of DCB from NDB patients ( Figure 3 E). Furthermore, early ctDNA dynamics outperformed all individual pre-treatment factors ( Figure S3 E, P < 0.05, accuracy = 73%) and patients with ctDNA molecular responses had significantly better clinical outcomes ( Figure 3 F, P = 0.013, PFS HR = 2.28). Thus, early ctDNA molecular response after just one cycle of ICI appears to be a promising approach for early response assessment. However, given that over 25% of patients are incorrectly classified, further improvements in predicting ultimate clinical outcomes would be desirable.
Having identified tumor-cell intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of ICI therapeutic benefit, we next combined these into integrated multi-parametric models. We developed two related Bayesian biomarker models, one relying on pre-treatment factors alone, and another incorporating early on-treatment ctDNA dynamics ( Figure 4 A). A Bayesian approach was chosen because we have previously demonstrated that it is a robust method for building risk-based models that include dynamic ctDNA measurements ( Kurtz et al., 2019 23. Kurtz, D.M. ∙ Esfahani, M.S. ∙ Scherer, F. ... Dynamic Risk Profiling Using Serial Tumor Biomarkers for Personalized Outcome Prediction Cell. 2019; 178 :699-713.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Four key features of the Bayesian approach that make it desirable are that it (1) enables incorporation of prior knowledge from established biomarkers to guard against overfitting to our own discovery cohort, (2) allows for missing parameters in cases where a specific feature may be unavailable (e.g., assay failure), (3) is well suited to binary classification problems often faced in the clinic such as DCB versus NDB, and (4) requires fewer training samples before predictions stabilize ( Kurtz et al., 2019 23. Kurtz, D.M. ∙ Esfahani, M.S. ∙ Scherer, F. ... Dynamic Risk Profiling Using Serial Tumor Biomarkers for Personalized Outcome Prediction Cell. 2019; 178 :699-713.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We trained the models in a discovery cohort consisting of patients with available pre-treatment and early on-treatment (≤4 weeks from start) blood samples ( Figure S1 B, DIREct Discovery Cohort, n = 34 patients) and then validated these in an independent DIREct Validation Cohort (n = 38 patients; Figures S1 B and 4 A). The patients in the two cohorts were all treated PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI (PD-1, n = 45; PD-L1, n = 2; PD-1+CTLA-4, n = 13; PD-1+Chemotherapy, n = 12) and had an expected distribution of histology, smoking status, tumor PD-L1 expression, and mutations for advanced NSCLC patients receiving ICI ( Figure 4 B).
Hyperparameters for the Bayesian models were inferred in two ways. For tumor PD-L1 expression and normalized bTMB, the hyperparameters were empirically inferred from the independent POPLAR/OAK ICI Cohort. For parameters unique to this study (circulating CD8 T cell fraction and early ctDNA dynamics), hyperparameters were inferred in a leave-one-out cross-validation framework (LOOCV) using the samples from the DIREct Discovery Cohort. The models were then trained in a LOOCV framework within the DIREct Discovery Cohort. For each patient, the models generate a distribution of the probability of achieving DCB, and the median of this distribution is used for predicting ultimate outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimum threshold for classification of DCB versus NDB. The models and thresholds were then locked, and we tested the performance of each of the parameters, models, and thresholds in the independent DIREct Validation Cohort of 38 advanced NSCLC patients receiving PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI (DIREct Validation Cohort, Table S7 ).
Using the outlined approach, a model based on pre-treatment tumor PD-L1 expression, normalized bTMB, and circulating CD8 T cells (DIREct-Pre: Durable Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling and ctDNA-Pre-treatment) was trained in the DIREct Discovery Cohort. Cross-validation analyses revealed that the DIREct-Pre model achieved 88% sensitivity (classifying DCB), at 56% specificity (accuracy = 71%, AUC = 0.68, precision = 64%, recall = 88%, Figure 5 A and S4 B). Patients with higher DIREct-Pre scores achieved significantly longer PFS ( Figure 5 B, PFS HR = 2.66, P = 0.012, Table S7 ). DIREct-Pre had similar classification performance in the validation cohort as in the discovery cohort (accuracy = 74%, AUC = 0.74, precision = 79%, recall = 71%, Table S7 ). Moreover, patients with higher DIREct-Pre scores had significantly longer PFS than those with low DIREct-Pre scores ( Figure 5 C, P = 0.03, PFS HR = 2.18).
While promising, we reasoned that incorporation of early ctDNA dynamics would further improve response classification performance. Indeed, the addition of early ctDNA response to DIREct-Pre significantly improved classification accuracy ( Figure 5 D). Furthermore, addition of early on-treatment ctDNA dynamics rendered tumor PD-L1 expression dispensable for outcome classification. Therefore, we removed it from our final model (DIREct-On, Durable Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling and ctDNA-On-treatment; Figures 5 D, S4 A, and S4B). Cross-validation analyses revealed the DIREct-On model to achieve 94% sensitivity (classifying DCB) and 89% specificity in the DIREct Discovery Cohort ( Figures 5 E and S4 B). Patients with higher DIREct-On scores had substantially longer PFS than those with lower scores ( Figure 5 F, P < 0.0001, HR = 8.93). Overall, DIREct-On achieved excellent classification performance across various performance metrics in the discovery cohort (accuracy = 92%, AUC = 0.93, precision = 88%, recall = 94%, Table S7 ). Importantly, application of the locked DIREct-On model and same threshold to the validation cohort demonstrated similarly excellent performance (accuracy = 92%, AUC = 0.93, precision = 95%, recall = 90%, Table S7 ). As expected, patients in the validation cohort with high DIREct-On scores also had significantly longer PFS than those with low DIREct-On scores, with a median PFS of 8.1 months versus 2.1 months, respectively ( Figure 5 G, P < 0.0001, PFS HR = 7.11). Thus, DIREct-On is a fully noninvasive multiparameter biomarker that robustly classifies ultimate outcomes to PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI.
To assess performance of DIREct-On compared to each individual feature, we compared accuracy of DCB versus NDB classification and hazard ratios of DIREct-On with that of individual features in the combined discovery and validation cohorts. DIREct-On had significantly better classification accuracy than each individual metric or tumor PD-L1 expression ( Figure 5 H). Moreover, comparison of hazard ratios also demonstrated that patients with high DIREct-On scores had a significantly lower risk of progression than patients with ctDNA molecular responses, low circulating CD8 T cells, high normalized bTMB, or high tumor PD-L1 expression ( P < 0.0001) ( Figure S5 A). Similarly, we also assessed the superiority of DIREct-On to each of the individual features that comprise the model using net reclassification improvement (NRI), which quantifies classification performance differences between models. DIREct-On was significantly superior to normalized bTMB (NRI = −1.48, P < 0.05), CD8 T cell fraction (NRI = −1.64, P < 0.01), and ctDNA dynamics (NRI = −1.13, P < 0.01) ( Figure 5 I, top). Thus, the multiparameter DIREct-On model significantly outperforms each individual feature.
To explore the importance of all three features of the DIREct-On model, we examined the ability of the other two features to correctly predict outcome when the third feature incorrectly predicts outcome. In each reclassification scenario, each feature was able to rescue classification in ≥45% of the cases ( Figures S5 B–S5D). Notably, for the pre-treatment features, normalized bTMB and CD8 T cell fraction were able to correctly classify at least 62% of their respective misclassifications ( Figures S5 B and S5C).
To further assess whether each of the features is required for optimal DIREct-On outcome classification, we constructed DIREct models that had each one of the parameters removed and compared the performance of these models to that of the full DIREct-On model. This enabled us to measure the impact of each feature on the overall performance of DIREct-On. We found that each feature that comprises DIREct-On is required for optimal performance ( Figure 5 I, bottom). As expected, removal of ctDNA dynamics had the most detrimental effect (NRI = −1.60, P < 0.001), but removal of either normalized bTMB or CD8 T cell fractions also significantly decreased performance (NRI = −1.25, P < 0.001; NRI = −1.13, P < 0.001, respectively). Comparison of HRs for the full DIREct-On model and the versions with each parameter removed showed similar results ( Figure S5 E). Thus, each feature is required for optimal response classification.
We next tested calibration of DIREct-Pre and DIREct-On in the validation cohort to evaluate how accurately they forecast ultimate clinical outcomes ( Steyerberg et al., 2010 42. Steyerberg, E.W. ∙ Vickers, A.J. ∙ Cook, N.R. ... Assessing the performance of prediction models: a framework for traditional and novel measures Epidemiology. 2010; 21 :128-138 Crossref Scopus (3259) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that both models were well calibrated (slope = 0.64, 0.98, respectively; Figures S5 F and S5G). Similarly, the DIREct-Pre and DIREct-On scores forecasted PFS as continuous variables in the validation cohort (Cox likelihood ratio test: PFS HR = 6.97, P = 0.007; PFS HR = 11.53, P < 0.0001, respectively).
Overall, in the cases that DIREct-On classified correctly, the second DIREct-On blood draw was performed on average 5.52 weeks prior to the first scan ( Figure 6 ). Moreover, DIREct-On correctly stratified patient outcomes on average 6.7 weeks prior to developing radiologically defined progression in NDB cases (n = 35) and on average 24.5 weeks prior to the best overall radiographic response in DCB cases (n = 37), indicating significant lead times ( Figure 6 ). Moreover, DIREct-On stratified patients equally well whether the early on-treatment blood draw was collected prior to 3 weeks or between 3 and 4 weeks (data not shown). Additionally, we assessed performance of age, ECOG performance status, line of therapy, and DIREct-On in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to test whether DIREct-On was independent from clinical factors known to be associated with outcome. DIREct-On was the only feature that was independently associated with PFS in this analysis ( Figure S6 A, HR = 0.06, P < 0.0001).
We further assessed the ability of DIREct-On to classify responses to PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI in our cohort and found high accuracy for prediction of patients achieving objective responses (26/29 [90%] of patients achieving a complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] had high DIREct-On scores) or progressive disease (PD, 27/29 [93%] of patients who had PD as best overall response had DIREct-On low scores) ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Thus, although DIREct-On was trained to distinguish between DCB versus NDB, it is also appears useful for predicting the likelihood of objective response. Furthermore, we found no significant difference in PFS between patients who achieved DCB or NDB versus those expected to do so by DIREct-On ( Figure 7 A).
Additionally, we performed subset analyses to assess the performance of DIREct-On in various clinical contexts in our cohort. Although DIREct-On was primarily trained and validated on patients treated with single-agent PD-1 blockade, it performed equally well in all three types of treatment regimens included in our study ( Table S7 ). Moreover, patients with high DIREct-On scores had similarly prolonged PFS regardless of treatment type, while patients with low DIREct-On scores had equally abbreviated PFS ( Figures 7 B and S7 A–S7C). Similarly, DIREct-On displayed similar classification efficacy in non-squamous or squamous tumors ( Figures S7 D and S7E, non-squamous, n = 7; squamous, n = 65). Therefore, DIREct-On appears to accurately stratify patient outcomes in PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI strategies in NSCLC.
Next, we explored the potential utility of DIREct-On for reconciling response status in patients with advanced lung cancer with ambiguous imaging results. First, we examined patients with a best overall response of SD, meaning a change in the sum of the largest diameters (SLDs) no greater than 20% increase or 30% decrease. In both the discovery and validation cohorts, DIREct-On accurately classified the durability of ICI response for 93% of patients (13/14) who achieved SD as their best radiographic response ( Figure 7 C). We also tested whether the presence of some shrinkage or growth that does not meet criteria for RECIST PR or PD could predict whether a patient will achieve DCB or NDB. Interestingly—and highlighting the need for improved tools to adjudicate radiologically defined stable disease—whether the tumors grew or shrunk within the bounds of +20% to −30% did not reliably classify whether these patients achieved DCB or NDB ( Figure S7 F, Fisher’s exact test P = 1.00) and did not stratify PFS ( Figure S7 G).
Two vignettes from our cohort highlight the ability of DIREct-On to adjudicate stable disease (SD) evaluations at the first on-treatment scan. LUP857 had a high DIREct-On score after 3 weeks and stable disease at the first scan 7 weeks after therapy initiation. As predicted by DIREct-On, this patient derived durable benefit from PD-1 blockade and maintained radiographic SD for over 1 year ( Figure 7 D). Another exemplar patient, LUP1014, also had stable disease at the first scan 7 weeks after therapy start yet had a low DIREct-On score at 3 weeks. As predicted by DIREct-On, this patient progressed at the second scan at 14 weeks after therapy initiation. ( Figure 7 E). Overall, in patients whose first scan after treatment initiation was classified as stable, DIREct-On correctly identified 94% of patients (17/18) ultimately achieving DCB ( Figure 7 F). Therefore, DIREct-On allows early identification of patients with initially stable disease who are most likely to achieve DCB from PD-(L)1 blockade-based ICI.

Section: Discussion

Here, we describe parameters associated with DCB from ICI in patients with advanced NSCLC that integrate both tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic features and that can be measured noninvasively using blood. We found lower baseline circulating CD8 T cell levels in patients with lung cancer ultimately achieving durable benefit from ICI, a result consistent with observations in melanoma responders to immunotherapy ( Krieg et al., 2018 22. Krieg, C. ∙ Nowicka, M. ∙ Guglietta, S. ... High-dimensional single-cell analysis predicts response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :144-153 Crossref Scopus (519) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also demonstrate that a pre-treatment composite model (DIREct-Pre) combining tumor PD-L1 expression with pre-treatment ctDNA and circulating immune cell profiling accurately predicts outcomes.
Moreover, we developed DIREct-On, which is a fully noninvasive response classifier that incorporates pre-treatment ctDNA and immune profiling with early on-treatment ctDNA response assessment to most accurately classify the likelihood of durable benefit after one cycle of immunotherapy. We demonstrate that DIREct-On outperforms each of the individual features alone and that each of the features is required for optimal classification efficacy. Our results also highlight and contrast the predictive power of measurements taken before and after therapy. Additionally, we believe there is significant biological rationale for each of the components of DIREct-Pre and DIREct-On: (1) pre-treatment ctDNA: reflects total-body tumor burden and patients with higher burden are known to respond less well to ICIs ( Ito et al., 2019 19. Ito, K. ∙ Schöder, H. ∙ Teng, R. ... Prognostic value of baseline metabolic tumor volume measured on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab therapy Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging. 2019; 46 :930-939 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaira et al., 2018 21. Kaira, K. ∙ Higuchi, T. ∙ Naruse, I. ... Metabolic activity by 18F–FDG-PET/CT is predictive of early response after nivolumab in previously treated NSCLC Eur. J. Nucleic Med. Mol. Imaging. 2018; 45 :56-66 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ); (2) tumor mutation burden: likely correlates with the number of tumor neoantigens and therefore higher values increase immunogenicity; (3) circulating CD8 T cell fraction: fewer CD8 T cells in circulation are associated with response, and we speculate that this could reflect greater homing of CD8 T cells to tumor deposits in patients with immunogenic tumors; and (4) early ctDNA dynamics: reflects change in disease burden early during therapy and is a direct reflection of tumor response or resistance. We envision that either model could be further improved by exploring additional biomarkers of clinical benefit, such as deeper immunophenotyping.
DIREct-On allows for classification of ultimate clinical outcomes significantly earlier than previously reported ctDNA-based approaches ( Anagnostou et al., 2019 1. Anagnostou, V. ∙ Forde, P.M. ∙ White, J.R. ... Dynamics of Tumor and Immune Responses during Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cancer Res. 2019; 79 :1214-1225 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Goldberg et al., 2018 14. Goldberg, S.B. ∙ Narayan, A. ∙ Kole, A.J. ... Early Assessment of Lung Cancer Immunotherapy Response via Circulating Tumor DNA Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :1872-1880 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raja et al., 2018 35. Raja, R. ∙ Kuziora, M. ∙ Brohawn, P.Z. ... Early Reduction in ctDNA Predicts Survival in Patients with Lung and Bladder Cancer Treated with Durvalumab Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :6212-6222 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). For on-treatment biomarkers, being able to assess response as early as possible is important since it would facilitate earlier changes in management. Moreover, we demonstrate that DIREct-On has significantly better performance than ctDNA dynamics alone. Therefore, the integration of pre-treatment parameters that can be measured noninvasively with on-treatment ctDNA dynamics allows for optimal classification of response. Furthermore, while cross-study comparisons of different techniques are fraught with caveats due to potential differences in patient cohorts, DIREct-On appears to outperform previously described integrative models relying on tumor RNA and/or DNA sequencing ( Anagnostou et al., 2020 2. Anagnostou, V. ∙ Niknafs, N. ∙ Marrone, K. ... Multimodal genomic features predict outcome of immune checkpoint blockade in non-small-cell lung cancer Nat.

Robust prediction of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in metastatic melanoma Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1545-1549 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cristescu et al., 2018 9. Cristescu, R. ∙ Mogg, R. ∙ Ayers, M. ... Pan-tumor genomic biomarkers for PD-1 checkpoint blockade–based immunotherapy Science. 2018; 362 :eaar3593 Crossref Scopus (1520) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiang et al., 2018 20. Jiang, P. ∙ Gu, S. ∙ Pan, D. ... Signatures of T cell dysfunction and exclusion predict cancer immunotherapy response Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1550-1558 Crossref Scopus (2802) PubMed Google Scholar ). The prior approaches were largely focused on melanoma rather than NSCLC and have substantially inferior performance compared to DIREct-On (prior studies: HR = 0.30–0.37, AUC = 0.70–0.83; DIREct-On: HR = 0.04–0.11, AUC = 0.89–0.93).
The endpoints of DCB and NDB were utilized to enable a binary classification approach. Unlike standard RECIST-based overall response classification criteria, the definition of DCB is inclusive of patients with long-term stable disease, and we have previously demonstrated that it robustly identifies patients with prolonged overall survival to PD-(L)1 blockade-based therapy ( Rizvi et al., 2018 38. Rizvi, H. ∙ Sanchez-Vega, F. ∙ La, K. ... Molecular Determinants of Response to Anti-Programmed Cell Death (PD)-1 and Anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Blockade in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Profiled With Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing J. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 36 :633-641 Crossref Scopus (1044) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, DIREct-On demonstrated robust, early, and noninvasive classification of DCB and PFS in a discovery and validation approach. Moreover, DIREct-On had excellent performance in various subsets of patients such as those receiving PD-(L)1 blockade with other ICI or chemotherapy, squamous versus non-squamous histology, and, crucially, those without objective responses or progression at the first scan. Of note, we do not envision that DIREct-On would replace radiologic surveillance of NSCLC patients treated with PD-(L)1 blockade since in patients predicted to develop early progression the anatomic distribution of progressing lesions could inform subsequent therapy (e.g., systemic therapy for progression in many sites versus local therapy such as radiotherapy for progression in a limited number of sites).
To test the clinical utility of DIREct-On, prospective clinical trials will be required. One potential treatment strategy for patients with driver mutation negative stage IV NSCLC that could be tested in clinical trials is to treat with single-agent PD-(L)1 blockade for one cycle (irrespective of PD-L1 expression) and to personalize subsequent cycles based on DIREct-On measured at 2–3 weeks after treatment start. Patients with high DIREct-On scores (expected durable benefit) could remain on single-agent PD-(L)1 blockade, whereas patients with low DIREct-On scores (expected lack of benefit) could be treated with several options including (1) adding chemotherapy to PD-(L)1 blockade, (2) adding an additional ICI such as CTLA-4 blockade for potential synergy, or (3) stopping the current ICI and changing to another agent/regimen ( Figure 7 G). If successful, such a trial could optimize the number of patients receiving immunotherapy alone and reserve combination therapy for patients who are destined not to respond to single-agent immunotherapy.
Limitations of our study include that it was retrospective and that patients were treated with somewhat heterogeneous PD-(L)1 regimens. Nevertheless, we found that DIREct-On performed similarly well regardless of type of PD-(L)1 regimen. Furthermore, since our training and validation cohorts were derived from patients receiving immunotherapy as part of standard-of-care management, they were different than the cohorts from the randomized POPLAR/OAK studies used for training some of the model parameters. Separately, while we validated the DIREct models in a held out patient cohort, this cohort was relatively small, resulting in relatively broad confidence intervals. While further validation in larger cohorts and prospective clinical trials will therefore be necessary, our data suggest that DIREct-On has strong prognostic power in real-world clinical settings. An additional limitation is that our cohort included few patients with targetable driver alterations (n = 9, 13%) including EGFR (L858R n = 4, Del19 n = 2) and BRAF (V600E n = 3), since these patients did not routinely receive immunotherapy during the time period of sample collection. Our cohort also did not include patients with active central nervous system disease. Therefore, it remains unclear how DIREct-On would perform in these important subsets of patients and further exploration is warranted.
Finally, we anticipate that our models could also have utility for predicting response to ICI in other tumor types since similar tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic features have been identified to associate with response to ICI in other cancers ( Cristescu et al., 2018 9. Cristescu, R. ∙ Mogg, R. ∙ Ayers, M. ... Pan-tumor genomic biomarkers for PD-1 checkpoint blockade–based immunotherapy Science. 2018; 362 :eaar3593 Crossref Scopus (1520) PubMed Google Scholar ; Krieg et al., 2018 22.

Med. 2018; 24 :144-153 Crossref Scopus (519) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the difficulty to date of developing robust predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy, approaches based on early response assessment could help fill the unmet need of improving personalization of therapy for patients treated with ICIs.

Stable disease was defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, meaning not significant shrinkage of the target lesions to be classified as partial response (≤30% decrease) or significant growth to be classified as progressive disease (≥20%). Durable clinical benefit (DCB) was defined as confirmed absence of progressive disease for at least 6 months after ICI; whereas, no durable benefit (NDB) was defined as patients experiencing progression or death within 6 months ( Rizvi et al., 2015 37. Rizvi, N.A. ∙ Hellmann, M.D. ∙ Snyder, A. ... Mutational landscape determines sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer Science. 2015; 348 :124-128 Crossref Scopus (6353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Progression-free survival was determined from the start of PD-(L)1 blockade, with outcomes determined or censored as of the 01/22/2019 database lock.
Thirty of 99 patients had tumor tissue available for whole-exome sequencing. All tumor tissue was obtained prior to treatment with immunotherapy. Tumor PD-L1 expression was assessed by clinical immunohistochemistry and the percentage of PD-L1 positive tumor cells was used as input into the relevant Bayesian models.
Plasma was processed from whole blood samples collected in EDTA tubes. Tubes were centrifuged at 2500 x g at room temperature for 10 minutes. The plasma supernatant was collected and the remaining plasma-depleted whole blood was collected for DNA and/or RNA purification. In indicated cases, density gradient centrifugation was used to collect PBMC for flow cytometry, DNA, and/or RNA isolation. Early on-treatment blood samples were collected using the first available on-treatment samples. In the majority of patients (96%) this specimen was collected at the time of the second immunotherapy infusion. The earliest collection time point for any patient as 12 days after initiation of therapy (median = 18.5; range = 12-28 days).
Cell-free DNA was extracted from three to six mL of plasma utilizing the QiaAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit per manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and quality and size was assessed by the Agilent 5400 Fragment Analyzer. For samples collected in CPT tubes, cfDNA was treated with Heparinase II (Sigma) for 2 hours at 37°C and re-purified by 1.8X Ampure XP bead selection prior to quantitation and size analysis.
Germline DNA was extracted from 100μL of PDWB or ∼30,000 PBMCs with the QiaAmp DNA Micro Kit per manufacturer’s instructions. 100-1000ng of genomic DNA was then sheared using the Covaris S2 Focused-ultrasonicator using the following settings: 10% duty cycle, intensity level 5, 200 cycles per burst, and 2 minute duration. After sonication, sheared DNA was re-purified using the QiaQuick PCR Purification Kit per manufacturer’s instructions.
CAPP-Seq was performed as previously described ( Newman et al., 2014 30. Newman, A.M. ∙ Bratman, S.V. ∙ To, J. ... An ultrasensitive method for quantitating circulating tumor DNA with broad patient coverage Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :548-554 Crossref Scopus (1668) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 32. Newman, A.M. ∙ Lovejoy, A.F. ∙ Klass, D.M. ... Integrated digital error suppression for improved detection of circulating tumor DNA Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :547-555 Crossref Scopus (762) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a 20-55ng of cfDNA or sheared genomic DNA was utilized for library preparation with the KAPA HyperPrep Kit with some modifications to the manufacturer’s instructions, as described ( Chabon et al., 2016 5. Chabon, J.J. ∙ Simmons, A.D. ∙ Lovejoy, A.F. ... Circulating tumour DNA profiling reveals heterogeneity of EGFR inhibitor resistance mechanisms in lung cancer patients Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11815 Crossref Scopus (525) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chaudhuri et al., 2017 7. Chaudhuri, A.A. ∙ Chabon, J.J. ∙ Lovejoy, A.F. ... Early Detection of Molecular Residual Disease in Localized Lung Cancer by Circulating Tumor DNA Profiling Cancer Discov. 2017; 7 :1394-1403 Crossref Scopus (675) PubMed Google Scholar ). After library preparation, custom-designed biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides were utilized for hybridization and subsequent enrichment with a capture panel covering 355 kb and targeting 270 genes. Following hybridization capture, samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 as 2 × 150bp lanes of 8-12 samples multiplexed per lane yielding ∼40 million paired-end reads with a median deduped depth of 3037X per case ( Table S4 ). Data were then processed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline ( Newman et al., 2014 30. Newman, A.M. ∙ Bratman, S.V. ∙ To, J. ... An ultrasensitive method for quantitating circulating tumor DNA with broad patient coverage Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :548-554 Crossref Scopus (1668) PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 32. Newman, A.M. ∙ Lovejoy, A.F. ∙ Klass, D.M. ... Integrated digital error suppression for improved detection of circulating tumor DNA Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :547-555 Crossref Scopus (762) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To abrogate the need for invasive biopsies, the CAPP-Seq analyses performed in this study were completed in a tumor-naive manner. For tumor naive calling we: 1) limited variants to coding positions, 2) removed any variants with greater than 1 reads in the matched germline samples, 3) removed variants with more than 2 reads in 5% of healthy control plasma samples (n = 54), 4) removed variants present in ≥ 0.05% of samples in the Genome Aggregation Database ( Lek et al., 2016 24. Lek, M. ∙ Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Minikel, E.V. ..., Exome Aggregation Consortium Analysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans Nature. 2016; 536 :285-291 Crossref Scopus (7264) PubMed Google Scholar ). For monitoring of these variants in early on-treatment samples we used a previously described Monte Carlo-based ctDNA detection index with a significance cut-point of p ≤ 0.05 ( Newman et al., 2014 30. Newman, A.M. ∙ Bratman, S.V. ∙ To, J. ... An ultrasensitive method for quantitating circulating tumor DNA with broad patient coverage Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :548-554 Crossref Scopus (1668) PubMed Google Scholar ). ctDNA fold change was calculated by dividing the ctDNA concentration at an on-treatment time point by the pre-treatment ctDNA concentration. In on-treatment cases where ctDNA was undetectable, the limit of detection for that sample was used as the ctDNA concentration, as described previously ( Moding et al., 2020 28. Moding, E.J. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Nabet, B.Y. ... Circulating tumor DNA dynamics predict benefit from consolidation immunotherapy in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer Nat. Can. 2020; 1 :176-183 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). To define the threshold for a ctDNA molecular response we analyzed previously published data from 23 treatment-naive advanced NSCLC patients who had three plasma collections over the course of 6 hours. The maximum deviation from the average ctDNA concentration amount these patients was 1.87-fold ( Wang et al., 2017 43. Wang, J. ∙ Bai, H. ∙ Hong, C. ... Analyzing epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status changes in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer at different sampling time-points of blood within one day Thorac. Cancer. 2017; 8 :312-319 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we considered a ctDNA molecular response as a ≤ 0.5-fold decrease from the pre-treatment time point.
Tumor mutation burden was estimated by CAPP-Seq by identifying the relationship between the number of nonsynonymous mutations identified in pre-treatment tumors by whole-exome sequencing per megabase of coding exome captured to the number of coding mutations (nonsynonymous and synonymous) identified in the pre-treatment cfDNA by CAPP-Seq per megabase of coding exome captured in a discovery cohort of 24 patients ( Figure S2 B). We derived a linear regression model in a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) framework in the discovery cohort 24 patients and found that TMB measured in cell-free DNA was significantly correlated with tissue TMB ( Figure S2 B, R = 0.86, p < 0.0001). This resulted in the following relationship: 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝐵 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁡ ( 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑀 ⁢ 𝐵 ) = 0 . 8 4 0 ∗ ( # 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑃 − 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑞 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 ) + 0 . 5 9 8 We then validated this model in the independent group of patients and again observed strong correlation ( Figure S2 C, R = 0.99, p < 0.001, n = 6).
We did not have access to viably preserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) amenable to flow cytometry for most patients but did have frozen plasma depleted whole blood (PDWB) containing leukocyte RNA for the majority of our cohort. Leukocyte RNA was extracted from either PDWB or PBMCs. For PDWB, RNA was extracted from 200μL of PDWB by mixing with 600μL TRIzol LS Reagent (ThermoFisher), 200μL of chloroform was used for phase separation. For PBMCs, pellets were lysed with 600μL of TRIzol Reagent and 150μL of chloroform was used for phase separation. For both starting materials, the aqueous phase from the initial phase separation was then mixed with equal volume of 100% ethanol, then loaded onto columns for the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) and the protocol was followed per manufacturer’s instruction, including on-column DNase treatment. The GLOBINclear Kit (ThermoFisher) was utilized to deplete globin mRNA per the manufacturer’s instructions in the PDWB samples. Before proceeding to RNA-seq, RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher) and quality was confirmed by DV200 and RIN after RNA Pico Bioanalyzer Analysis. All RNA samples sequenced had DV200 ≥ 80%.
The Illumina TruSeq RNA Exome kit was used for RNA-seq library preparation with 20ng of input PBMC RNA or globin-depleted PDWB RNA per manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, RNA was fragmented and stranded cDNA libraries were created per the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA libraries were then enriched for the coding transcriptome by exon capture. Hybridization captures were then pooled and samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 as 2 × 150bp lanes of 16-20 samples per lane, yielding ∼20 million paired-end reads per case. After demultiplexing the data were aligned and expression levels summarized using Salmon to Gencode version 27 transcript models ( Patro et al., 2017 34. Patro, R. ∙ Duggal, G. ∙ Love, M.I. ... Salmon provides fast and bias-aware quantification of transcript expression Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :417-419 Crossref Scopus (5683) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression levels per gene were summarized as transcripts per million (TPM), and then used as input for CIBERSORTx for deconvolution with the LM22 signature matrix with B-mode batch correction ( Newman et al., 2019 33. Newman, A.M. ∙ Steen, C.B. ∙ Liu, C.L. ... Determining cell type abundance and expression from bulk tissues with digital cytometry Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :773-782 Crossref Scopus (2048) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Whole-exome libraries were prepared using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v2.0, v4.0, or the Illumina Rapid Capture Exome Kit, as described previously ( Hellmann et al., 2020 18. Hellmann, M.D. ∙ Nabet, B.Y. ∙ Rizvi, H. ... Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis to Assess Risk of Progression after Long-term Response to PD-(L)1 Blockade in NSCLC Clin. Cancer Res. 2020; 26 :2849-2858 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Captured exome libraries for tumor and germline DNA were sequenced to equivalent depths on HiSeq2000, HiSeq2500, or HiSeq4000 platforms as 2x75bp or 2x150bp reads and aligned to the hg19 human genome build using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner ( Li and Durbin, 2009 25. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32751) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further indel realignment, base-quality score recalibration, and duplicate-read removal were performed utilizing the Genome Analysis Toolkit ( DePristo et al., 2011 10. DePristo, M.A. ∙ Banks, E. ∙ Poplin, R. ... A framework for variation discovery and genotyping using next-generation DNA sequencing data Nat. Genet. 2011; 43 :491-498 Crossref Scopus (8034) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single nucleotide variants were identified using MuTect with default parameters ( Cibulskis et al., 2013 8. Cibulskis, K. ∙ Lawrence, M.S. ∙ Carter, S.L. ... Sensitive detection of somatic point mutations in impure and heterogeneous cancer samples Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31 :213-219 Crossref Scopus (3402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tumor mutational burden per megabase for bTMB estimation was calculated by dividing the total number of nonsynonymous mutations by the coding region of each respective capture kit (Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v2.0 = 29.9MB, Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v4.0 = 34.2 MB, Illumina Rapid Capture Exome Kit = 42.7MB).
Flow cytometry was used to confirm the fidelity of CIBERSORTx estimates for the major lymphoid and myeloid lineages among the cellular subsets captured by the LM22 signature matrix, whether viable or nonviable leukocytes were used as input RNA for sequencing and subsequent transcriptome deconvolution. To do so, single cell suspensions were prepared from viably frozen PBMC aliquots. Live/dead cell discrimination was performed using 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend). Human Fc receptors were blocked using Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend). Cell surface staining was performed for 30 min at 4°C with the following antibodies: CD14 (Clone: M5E2, Color: BV421, BD Biosciences), CD3 (Clone: UCHT1, Color: PE, BioLegend), CD4 (Clone: RPA-T4, Color: PerCP-Cy5.5, BD Biosciences), CD8 (Clone: RPA-T8, Color: FITC, BD Biosciences), CD19 (Clone: SJ25C1, Color: BV711, BD Biosciences), and CD56 (Clone: HCD56, Color: PE-Cy7,BioLegend). All data acquisition was done using a FACS Aria Fusion (BD Biosciences) or a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyses were performed using FlowJo v10. CD4 T cells were gated by CD14-, CD19-, CD3+, CD8-, CD4+; CD8 T cells were gated by CD14-, CD19-, CD3+, CD8+, CD4-; monocytes were gated by CD56-, CD3-, CD19-, CD14+; B cells were gated by CD3-, CD19+; and NK cells were gated by CD14-, CD3-, CD19-, CD56+.
The Wilcoxon test was used to compare groups where indicated. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare bTMB high versus bTMB low in the normalized bTMB Discovery and Validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to generate area under the curve (AUC), and 95% confidence intervals for AUCs were generated by bootstrapping ( Robin et al., 2011 39. Robin, X. ∙ Turck, N. ∙ Hainard, A. ... pROC: an open-source package for R and S+ to analyze and compare ROC curves BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :77 Crossref Scopus (7990) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significance analysis of performance evaluation metrics (AUC, NRI, hazard ratio, and accuracy) were also computed by bootstrapping, where the difference in the metrics curves for each bootstrap replicate is computed and compared across conditions to generate an empiric P- value ( Kurtz et al., 2019 23. Kurtz, D.M. ∙ Esfahani, M.S. ∙ Scherer, F. ... Dynamic Risk Profiling Using Serial Tumor Biomarkers for Personalized Outcome Prediction Cell. 2019; 178 :699-713.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For progression-free survival analysis, the log-rank test was used to compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to generate hazard ratios as stratified relative to cut-points defined in each figure, as captured in corresponding legends. Stratification thresholds were determined using optimal cut-point selection by ROC analysis only within the discovery cohorts. For ctDNA dynamics, the cut-point was not optimized and 0.5 was used as the cut-point in both discovery and validation cohorts. For PFS analysis of the validation cohorts, the cut-points from the discovery cohorts were applied to the respective validation sets to stratify response. DIREct-Pre and DIREct-On were also tested as continuous variables in the validation cohort by Cox likelihood ratio test. When comparing performance of individual biomarkers to each other or to Bayesian probit models analyses were restricted to patients with all data types available, as described in the corresponding legends. All analyses were conducted using R v.3.5.1 using the pROC, survminer, MCMCpack, survIDINRI, and survival packages.
To classify DCB versus NDB we utilized a Bayesian probit approach ( Figure 4 A). In brief, patients were split into the DIREct Discovery (n = 34) and DIREct Validation Cohort (n = 38). Features that associated with ultimate outcomes were identified in the DIREct Discovery Cohort. For the Bayesian probit models, hyperparameters without prior knowledge in publicly available data were inferred using a LOOCV framework in the DIREct Discovery Cohort samples (CD8 T cell fraction and early ctDNA dynamics). For features with publicly available data available (tumor PD-L1 expression and normalized bTMB), hyperparameters were empirically inferred from the POPLAR/OAK ICI Cohort (n = 424). The models were then trained in the DIREct Discovery Cohort and DCB versus NDB was stratified based on the best threshold (Youden’s J). Based on the performance of DIREct-On in the discovery cohort, a validation cohort of > 20 provides > 99% power to detect a similar difference between the two groups (one-sided two-arm binomial with alpha = 0.05). The models and thresholds were then applied to the DIREct Validation Cohort.
Specifically, likelihood of DCB for each sample is modeled as 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑦 𝐷 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐵 = Φ ⁡ ( 𝒙 𝑻 ⁢ 𝜷 ) , where Φ ⁡ ( . ) denotes the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal variable, 𝒙 denotes the feature vector (i.e., normalized bTMB, PD-L1, and CD8 fraction for DIREct-Pre and normalized bTMB, CD8 fraction, and ΔctDNA for DIREct-On), and 𝜷 denotes the model parameters from prior knowledge derived from the literature or from our discovery cohort (as described below). The model parameters were assumed to be governed by a Gaussian distribution, i.e., 𝜷 ∼ 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝜷 0 , 𝚲 − 1 0 ) , where 𝜷 0 and 𝚲 − 1 0 denote the mean and covariance matrix of the distribution, respectively. This approach allows for uncertainty in the underlying distributions (as might be expected for example between different ctDNA profiling techniques or patient populations) and therefore expected to be more generalizable for response prediction.
To identify the parameters of the Gaussian distribution governing the probit coefficients, we denoted the features from the POPLAR/OAK ICI Cohort ( Gandara et al., 2018 12. Gandara, D.R. ∙ Paul, S.M. ∙ Kowanetz, M. ... Blood-based tumor mutational burden as a predictor of clinical benefit in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with atezolizumab Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :1441-1448 Crossref Scopus (893) PubMed Google Scholar ), by 𝑿 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 and the corresponding labels (DCB/NDB) by 𝒀 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 . Here, we subsampled of n = 100 cases for 𝑚 = 2 0 0 0 times. For each iteration and for each set of covariates (e.g., PD-L1 and normalized bTMB), we solved a probit regression model to generate a matrix of associated coefficients ( 𝜷 ). We used this matrix as a random realization of this multi-variable normal distribution, and then estimated the Bayes prior probability parameters via maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., hyper-parameters).
We used a LOOCV framework to fully exploit the available data, and for the features not estimated by 𝑿 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 (e.g., CD8 T cell fraction). Specifically, we used 𝑛 − 1 samples to find the hyperparameters as described above. We then derived the final full prior probability distributions by concatenating two components: (1) the prior knowledge-based priors, and (2) the priors derived from our DIREct Discovery Cohort, such that 𝜷 = [ 𝜷 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 , 𝜷 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 ] 𝑇 ∼ 𝑁 ⁡ ( [ 𝜷 0 , 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 , 𝜷 0 , 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 ] 𝑇 , [ 𝚲 − 1 0 , 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 0 0 𝚲 − 1 0 , 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 ] ) where 𝜷 0 , 𝒑 𝒓 𝒊 𝒐 𝒓 and 𝜷 0 , 𝒐 𝒖 𝒓 𝒄 𝒐 𝒉 𝒐 𝒓 𝒕 are the mean vectors of the variables, estimated from the prior set and our cohort, respectively. Similarly 𝚲 − 1 0 , 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 and 𝚲 − 1 0 , 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑡 denote the covariance matrices. We then used the same 𝑛 − 1 samples with all available covariates in a MCMC step to calculate the posterior probabilities (i.e., updated prior probabilities). In cases where tumor PD-L1 expression was unavailable (DIREct Discovery Cohort, n = 8; DIREct Validation Cohort, n = 4), this parameter was left out.
To generate a single score representing the probability of DCB, we used the MCMC posterior samples, and generated 10,000 pseudo-samples with 1000 initial burn-in. We then performed thinning by considering every 10th value. These realizations of the 𝜷 vectors (i.e., { 𝜷 1 , 𝜷 2 , … , 𝜷 1 0 0 0 } along with the sample feature vector, 𝒙 ) were then used to calculate 1,000 realizations of the DCB score, such that Φ ⁡ ( 𝒙 𝑻 ⁢ 𝜷 𝒊 ) for 𝑖 ∈ { 1 , … , 1 0 0 0 } . We then used the median of these realizations as the final prediction score.
To select the optimal thresholds in the discovery cohort for the DIREct-Pre and DIREct-On scores, we used the optimal ROC corner point approach (Youden’s J) for classification of DCB, where the optimality was defined as the point with maximal unweighted accuracy, i.e., specificity plus sensitivity ( Youden, 1950 45. Youden, W.J. Index for rating diagnostic tests Cancer. 1950; 3 :32-35 Crossref Scopus (8558) PubMed Google Scholar ). These cut-points were then applied to the validation set for calculation of precision and survival analyses.
We evaluated DIREct predictions for quantitative accuracy via model calibration regression ( Steyerberg et al., 2010 42. Steyerberg, E.W. ∙ Vickers, A.J. ∙ Cook, N.R. ... Assessing the performance of prediction models: a framework for traditional and novel measures Epidemiology. 2010; 21 :128-138 Crossref Scopus (3259) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test calibration of the DIREct-Pre and DIREct-On models we performed a bootstrap resampling with n = 2000 and reported the “true event rate,” estimated via the Kaplan-Meier maximum likelihood estimates of observed events versus expected events from our models’ predictions. A perfect calibration leads to a slope of 1, i.e., the predicted probability of the model is in fact representative of the true event rate in the population.
We have created a web resource for the DIREct-On model described in this study. Here, readers can input parameters to generated DIREct-On scores and predictions for individual and batched samples and download the code used to generate the model. URL: https://direct.stanford.edu
