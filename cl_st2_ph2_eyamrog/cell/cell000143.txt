Title: Recognition of Semaphorin Proteins by P. sordellii Lethal Toxin Reveals Principles of Receptor Specificity in Clostridial Toxins


Abstract: Summary

Pathogenic clostridial species secrete potent toxins that induce severe host tissue damage. Paeniclostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) causes an almost invariably lethal toxic shock syndrome associated with gynecological infections. TcsL is 87% similar to C. difficile TcdB, which enters host cells via Frizzled receptors in colon epithelium. However, P. sordellii infections target vascular endothelium, suggesting that TcsL exploits another receptor. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we establish semaphorins SEMA6A and SEMA6B as TcsL receptors. We demonstrate that recombinant SEMA6A can protect mice from TcsL-induced edema. A 3.3 Å cryo-EM structure shows that TcsL binds SEMA6A with the same region that in TcdB binds structurally unrelated Frizzled. Remarkably, 15 mutations in this evolutionarily divergent surface are sufficient to switch binding specificity of TcsL to that of TcdB. Our findings establish semaphorins as physiologically relevant receptors for TcsL and reveal the molecular basis for the difference in tissue targeting and disease pathogenesis between highly related toxins.

Section: Introduction

Paeniclostridium sordellii (also known as Clostridium sordellii ) is an anaerobic gram-positive bacterium found in soil and in the gastrointestinal and vaginal tracts of animals and humans. P. sordellii is present in the rectal or vaginal tract of 3%–4% of women, but vaginal colonization rate after childbirth is as high as 29% ( Aldape et al., 2016 4. Aldape, M.J. ∙ Bayer, C.R. ∙ Bryant, A.E. ...

Gynecol. 2016; 127 :360-368 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the majority of carriers are asymptomatic, pathogenic P. sordellii infections arise rapidly and are highly lethal. The origin of pathogenic P. sordellii strains is unclear, but most infections occur in women after childbirth, medically induced abortion, or miscarriage, leading to a toxic shock syndrome with almost 100% mortality within days ( Aldape et al., 2016 4. Aldape, M.J. ∙ Bayer, C.R. ∙ Bryant, A.E. ...

The primary cause of the high mortality associated with P. sordellii infections is the lethal toxin TcsL ( Carter et al., 2011 5. Carter, G.P. ∙ Awad, M.M. ∙ Hao, Y. ... TcsL is an essential virulence factor in Clostridium sordellii ATCC 9714 Infect. Immun. 2011; 79 :1025-1032 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ), which belongs to the large clostridial toxin (LCT) family ( Orrell et al., 2017 34. Orrell, K.E. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Sugiman-Marangos, S.N. ... Clostridium difficile toxins A and B: Receptors, pores, and translocation into cells Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2017; 52 :461-473 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). LCTs enter the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis into acidified endosomes followed by pH-dependent pore formation and translocation into the cytoplasm ( Papatheodorou et al., 2010 35.

Translocation domain mutations affecting cellular toxicity identify the Clostridium difficile toxin B pore Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :3721-3726 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). After autoprocessing in the cytosol, the released cytotoxic glucosyltransferase enzymes potently modulate host cell function by inactivating small Rho-family GTPases by using uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose or UDP- N -acetylglucosamine as a co-substrate ( Aktories and Barbieri, 2005 2.

Reineke, J. ∙ Tenzer, S. ∙ Rupnik, M. ... Autocatalytic cleavage of Clostridium difficile toxin B Nature. 2007; 446 :415-419 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although all LCTs are highly similar at the sequence level, they differ in their tissue specificity and in their effects on cell morphology, physiology, and viability. TcsL is most closely related to the C. difficile cytotoxin TcdB, sharing almost 90% sequence similarity. TcdB is the causal virulence factor behind gastrointestinal diseases associated with C. difficile infections. TcdB binds Frizzled family receptors FZD1, FZD2, and FZD7 expressed in the colonic epithelium ( Chen et al., 2018 8. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ... Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B Science. 2018; 360 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tao et al., 2016 49. Tao, L. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Meraner, P. ... Frizzled proteins are colonic epithelial receptors for C. difficile toxin B Nature. 2016; 538 :350-355 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ), the primary site of C. difficile infection. In contrast, although present in the intestinal microbiota, P. sordellii does not infect or damage the colonic epithelium, suggesting that TcsL binds a different cell surface receptor. This is supported by earlier competition experiments with recombinant TcdB and TcsL in vitro , showing differential sensitivity of cell lines to TcsL and TcdB ( Chaves-Olarte et al., 1997 6. Chaves-Olarte, E. ∙ Weidmann, M. ∙ Eichel-Streiber, C. ... Toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile differ with respect to enzymatic potencies, cellular substrate specificities, and surface binding to cultured cells J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100 :1734-1741 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although recent studies have begun to uncover receptors for other LCTs, the physiologically relevant TcsL receptors are still unknown. In addition, it is not understood at the molecular level how structurally and functionally similar LCTs can bind completely unrelated receptors.
Here, we employ genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify semaphorins SEMA6A and SEMA6B as the host cell receptors for TcsL. We show that recombinant SEMA6A ectodomain can protect lung endothelial cells from TcsL intoxication in vitro and mouse lungs from TcsL-induced edema in vivo . To further understand the molecular basis of LCT receptor specificity, we determine the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of TcsL bound to SEMA6A. Comparison of this structure to the TcsL-Frizzled2 structure ( Chen et al., 2018 8. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ... Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B Science. 2018; 360 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) reveals that TcsL and TcdB bind their structurally unrelated receptors by using the same receptor-binding region. However, selective clustering of mutations explains how the two toxins have evolved distinct specificities. We formally demonstrate the role of the clustered mutations in the receptor-binding site by switching the receptor specificity of TcsL from SEMA6A to Frizzled. These results have broad implications for our understanding of host receptor pathogenic toxins evolution at the molecular level.

Section: Results

To identify potential cell-surface receptors for TcsL, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in Hap1 cells. We used the genome-wide TKOv3 guide RNA (gRNA) library that targets 18,053 genes with four different gRNAs per gene ( Hart et al., 2017 19. Hart, T. ∙ Tong, A.H.Y. ∙ Chan, K. ... Evaluation and Design of Genome-Wide CRISPR/SpCas9 Knockout Screens G3 (Bethesda). 2017; 7 :2719-2727 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were infected with the library and treated with 0.1 nM or 1 nM TcsL. Sequencing of gRNAs from the surviving population revealed only two genes that were significantly enriched in both screens ( Figures 1 A and 1B and Table S1 ). One was UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2), which was also a top hit in previous CRISPR/Cas9 screens with two other LCTs, TcdA and TcdB ( Tao et al., 2016, 2019 49. Tao, L. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Meraner, P. ... Frizzled proteins are colonic epithelial receptors for C. difficile toxin B Nature. 2016; 538 :350-355 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Tao, L. ∙ Tian, S. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Sulfated glycosaminoglycans and low-density lipoprotein receptor contribute to Clostridium difficile toxin A entry into cells Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1760-1769 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). UGP2 is needed for the synthesis of UDP-glucose, the sugar donor for the glucosylation activity of all LCTs ( Aktories and Just, 1995 3. Aktories, K. ∙ Just, I. Monoglucosylation of low-molecular-mass GTP-binding Rho proteins by clostridial cytotoxins Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5 :441-443 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). The other hit was SEMA6A, encoding a transmembrane axon guidance molecule not previously linked to toxin function.
Notably, despite high sequence similarity between TcsL and TcdB, our screen did not identify Frizzled receptors, or CSPG4 or PVRL3, two other TcdB-associated receptors ( LaFrance et al., 2015 27. LaFrance, M.E. ∙ Farrow, M.A. ∙ Chandrasekaran, R. ... Identification of an epithelial cell receptor responsible for Clostridium difficile TcdB-induced cytotoxicity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 functions as the cellular receptor for Clostridium difficile toxin B Cell Res. 2015; 25 :157-168 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neither did we identify known receptors for C. perfringens TpeL or C. difficile TcdA, other related LCTs ( Schorch et al., 2014 43. Schorch, B. ∙ Song, S. ∙ van Diemen, F.R. ... LRP1 is a receptor for Clostridium perfringens TpeL toxin indicating a two-receptor model of clostridial glycosylating toxins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6431-6436 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tao et al., 2019 50. Tao, L. ∙ Tian, S. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Sulfated glycosaminoglycans and low-density lipoprotein receptor contribute to Clostridium difficile toxin A entry into cells Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1760-1769 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), although their receptors are expressed in Hap1 cells ( Figure S1 ).
We first validated screen results by knocking out UGP2 and SEMA6A in Hap1 cells. UGP2 KO and SEMA6A KO cells were highly resistant to TcsL ( Figure S1 ). Introduction of wild-type SEMA6A by lentiviral transduction to SEMA6A KO cells rendered the cells more sensitive to the toxin ( Figure S1 ). SEMA6A is a member of the semaphorin family, which in humans consists of twenty transmembrane and secreted proteins ( Worzfeld and Offermanns, 2014 56. Worzfeld, T. ∙ Offermanns, S. Semaphorins and plexins as therapeutic targets Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13 :603-621 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ). The four human SEMA6 class proteins are SEMA6A, SEMA6B, SEMA6C, and SEMA6D ( Figure 1 C). SEMA6A is most closely related to SEMA6B with 69% sequence similarity and 53% identity, followed by SEMA6D (60% similarity, 46% identity) and SEMA6C (56% similarity, 40% identity). We generated knockout Hap1 cells for each SEMA6 family member and assayed their sensitivity to TcsL. SEMA6C KO and SEMA6D KO cells were as sensitive to TcsL as control cells (50% growth inhibition [GI50]: 50 pM) ( Figure 1 D). In contrast, SEMA6B KO cells were approximately 10-fold more resistant (GI50: 500 pM) than control cells, but not as resistant as SEMA6A KO cells (50-fold; GI50: 2.5 nM). Moreover, SEMA6A-SEMA6B double knockout cells were more resistant to TcsL than either knockout alone, suggesting that SEMA6A and SEMA6B act redundantly ( Figure 1 D). Consistent with this, HeLa cells that do not express SEMA6A or SEMA6B were highly resistant to TcsL ( Figure S1 ). Because SEMA6C and SEMA6D are expressed at low amounts in Hap1 and HeLa cells ( Figure S1 ), we further assessed their role in TcsL intoxication by ectopically expressing each SEMA6 in SEMA6A KO cells by lentiviral infection. In contrast to ectopic SEMA6A and SEMA6B expression, SEMA6C and SEMA6D did not render SEMA6A KO cells more sensitive to the toxin ( Figure 1 E). Thus, SEMA6A and SEMA6B but not SEMA6C or SEMA6D regulate cellular sensitivity to TcsL. These results are consistent with the model that both SEMA6A and SEMA6B can act as TcsL receptors, and sensitivity to the toxin is determined by the total amount of SEMA6A and SEMA6B.
We then expressed and purified the soluble recombinant extracellular domain (rECD) of SEMA6A and tested its effect on TcsL toxicity on Vero cells, a commonly used cell line for studying toxin function. Vero cells express SEMA6A but not SEMA6B ( Figure S1 ). SEMA6A rECD inhibited TcsL toxicity in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 A). Notably, SEMA6A rECD had a protective effect only when it was added to the cells before or simultaneously with TcsL ( Figure S1 ). When cells were pretreated for 1 h with TcsL, SEMA6A rECD had no effect on toxicity, suggesting that SEMA6A rECD must act before TcsL binds the cells. We also repeated the competition assay with soluble ectodomains of SEMA6B, SEMA6C, and SEMA6D. Consistent with our experiments in Hap1 cells (above), SEMA6B alleviated TcsL toxicity, whereas SEMA6C and SEMA6D had no effect ( Figures 2 B and 2C). These results strongly suggest that TcsL can directly bind SEMA6A and SEMA6B and this interaction is needed for TcsL entry into the cell.
A primary target of TcsL during P. sordellii infection is the vascular endothelium of the lung ( Geny et al., 2007 15. Geny, B. ∙ Khun, H. ∙ Fitting, C. ... Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin kills mice by inducing a major increase in lung vascular permeability Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170 :1003-1017 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we used immortalized human lung microvascular cells (HULECs) as a physiologically relevant cell line to study the role of SEMA6A and SEMA6B in TcsL intoxication. Notably, HULECs express ∼4-fold higher amounts of SEMA6A and ∼11-fold higher amounts of SEMA6B than Hap1 cells ( Figure 3 A). We assayed the sensitivity of HULECs to four related clostridial toxins: TcdA and TcdB from C. difficile , TpeL from C. perfringens , and TcsL ( Figure 3 B). TpeL showed low toxicity, and TcdA and TcdB were several orders of magnitude less toxic to HULECs than what is reported for other cell types ( Chaves-Olarte et al., 1997 6. Chaves-Olarte, E. ∙ Weidmann, M. ∙ Eichel-Streiber, C. ... Toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile differ with respect to enzymatic potencies, cellular substrate specificities, and surface binding to cultured cells J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100 :1734-1741 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gupta et al., 2017 17. Gupta, P. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Sugiman-Marangos, S.N. ... Functional defects in Clostridium difficile TcdB toxin uptake identify CSPG4 receptor-binding determinants J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :17290-17301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, the GI 50 of TcsL was just ∼50 femtomolar, indicating that ∼200 toxin molecules per cell are lethal to HULECs. Furthermore, recombinant ectodomain of mouse Sema6a fused to Fc fragment (rSema6a-Fc) but not mouse Sema6c ectodomain-Fc (rSema6c-Fc) could block TcsL-induced rounding of HULECs in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 3 C and 3D). These results further suggest that SEMA6A and SEMA6B are the physiologically relevant TcsL receptors in endothelial cells.
We then addressed the role of semaphorins in vivo in a mouse model of TcsL intoxication. We first examined the expression of Sema6a and Sema6b in mouse lung tissue by immunohistochemistry. Both proteins were highly expressed in lung endothelium and pneumocytes ( Figure 3 E). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with a lethal dose of TcsL together with rSema6a-Fc, rSema6c-Fc, or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (n = 3 for each group). Mice co-injected with BSA or Sema6c-Fc rapidly developed symptoms of TcsL intoxication, including decreased mobility and signs of ataxia and dehydration. Within 4 h, all symptomatic mice had a buildup of fluid in the lungs ( Figure 3 F). Histopathologically, symptomatic mice showed edema surrounding pulmonary vessels ( Figure 3 F). In contrast, rSema6a-Fc protected the mice from TcsL-induced symptoms. Mice co-injected with rSema6a-Fc had no pleural effusion and did not show signs of edema after 4 h ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Altogether, these data support that SEMA6A and SEMA6B are the physiologically relevant receptors for TcsL and that this interaction can be inhibited in vivo .
Having established SEMA6A and SEMA6B as the cellular receptors of TcsL, we next structurally characterized the interaction between TcsL and SEMA6A by using cryo-EM. We used a shortened TcsL fragment spanning amino acids (aa) 1285–1804 (TcsL 1285–1804 ), analogous to the TcdB fragment previously used to determine the TcdB-Frizzled2 complex structure ( Chen et al., 2018 8. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ... Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B Science. 2018; 360 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a biolayer interferometry assay with immobilized ligand, which measures the avidity of interactions, the TcsL 1285–1804 fragment bound recombinant SEMA6A ectodomain with nanomolar apparent affinity ( Figures 4 A and S3 ). Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was used to prevent dissociation of the TcsL 1285–1804 -SEMA6A complex during cryo-EM grid preparation, as described previously ( Dong et al., 2019 12. Dong, D. ∙ Zheng, L. ∙ Lin, J. ...

Structure of a yeast spliceosome at 3.6-angstrom resolution Science. 2015; 349 :1182-1191 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initial analysis of the dataset revealed that approximately 50% of the SEMA6A dimers were bound to TcsL by using this sample preparation approach. Consequently, 2D and 3D classification resulted in two homogeneous datasets corresponding to the TcsL-SEMA6A complex (179,188 particle images) ( Figures S2 and S3 ) and unliganded SEMA6A (281,207 particle images) ( Figures S2 and S3 ), which were used to produce final density maps to overall resolutions of 3.3 and 3.1 Å, respectively ( Table S2 ). Local resolution of the TcsL-SEMA6A map ranged from 2.8 Å at the binding interface to > 30 Å at the C terminus of TcsL ( Figure S4 ). Indeed, 3D variability analysis ( Punjani et al., 2017 39. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3664) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed continuous motion of the C and N termini of TcsL in contrast to a largely rigid SEMA6A dimer and TcsL-SEMA6A interface ( Video S1 ). A molecular model was built for the well-resolved central domain of TcsL (residues 1400–1637), corresponding to approximately 40% of the TcsL construct ( Figure 4 A).

The structure of TcsL is highly similar to previously determined structures of other clostridial toxins, particularly TcdB (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] = 1.3 Å) ( Chen et al., 2018 8. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ...

Selection and characterization of ultrahigh potency designed ankyrin repeat protein inhibitors of C. difficile toxin B PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000311 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S5 ). Similarly, unliganded and TcsL-bound SEMA6A structures are in remarkable agreement ( Figure S5 ), indicating that TcsL binding is not accompanied by significant conformational changes in the receptor and that glutaraldehyde treatment had a negligible effect on the SEMA6A structure.
SEMA6A interacts with TcsL at two predominant sites ( Figure 4 B), burying a total surface area of 1,236 Å 2 . The major contact is through a short α-helix (residues 101–110) between blades 1 and 2, in a characteristic “extrusion” of semaphorin family beta-propellers ( Janssen et al., 2010 21. Janssen, B.J.C. ∙ Robinson, R.A. ∙ Pérez-Brangulí, F. ...

Structural basis for semaphorin signalling through the plexin receptor Nature. 2010; 467 :1123-1127 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). The other site is in the flexible loop between beta sheets 3B and 3C (Asp189, Phe190, Leu191, and Ile193) ( Figures 4 B and S6 ). Notably, the TcsL-binding interface is where SEMA6A’s cognate ligand Plexin A2 also binds ( Figure 4 C) ( Janssen et al., 2010 21. Janssen, B.J.C. ∙ Robinson, R.A. ∙ Pérez-Brangulí, F. ...

Structural basis for semaphorin signalling through the plexin receptor Nature. 2010; 467 :1123-1127 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, over half of the TcsL-binding interface in SEMA6A is shared with Plexin A2 ( Figures 4 C and S6 ). Another notable similarity between Plexin A2 and TcsL is their semaphorin specificity: both bind SEMA6A and SEMA6B but not SEMA6C or SEMA6D ( Worzfeld and Offermanns, 2014 56. Worzfeld, T. ∙ Offermanns, S. Semaphorins and plexins as therapeutic targets Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13 :603-621 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the SEMA6A-TcsL structure, two SEMA6A residues (Arg108 and Ile193) that engage in contact with TcsL are identical in SEMA6B but not conserved in SEMA6C and SEMA6D ( Figure S6 ), likely explaining the specificity of TcsL. Ile193 forms critical contacts also with Plexin A2 ( Figure S6 ), suggesting that the semaphorin specificity of TcsL and Plexin A2 are based on similar molecular principles.
On TcsL, the SEMA6A interaction interface is located on a convex edge of the delivery domain ( Figure 5 A). The highly hydrophobic interface is mainly formed by residues located in an antiparallel beta sheet (residues 1466–1511), flanked by an α-helix (1433–1438) on one side and a loop (1596–1601) on the other. Strikingly, this location on C. difficile cytotoxin TcdB is also the one used to bind Frizzled receptors, which are structurally unrelated to semaphorins ( Chen et al., 2018 8. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ... Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B Science. 2018; 360 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 A). Nevertheless, both toxins bind their receptors in a similar manner. The hydrophobic nature of this pocket is conserved in TcsL but the amino acid identities are not ( Figure 5 A). Moreover, the interaction of TcdB with FZD2 is bridged by a palmitoleic acid (PAM) moiety, which is buried in a hydrophobic pocket of TcdB ( Figure 5 B) ( Chen et al., 2018 8. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ... Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B Science. 2018; 360 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). In TcsL, the pocket buries the hydrophobic side chain of SEMA6A Met109 in an analogous manner to the palmitoleic acid moiety in the TcdB-FZD2 structure ( Figure 5 B and Table S3 ). In fact, although none of the six residues that in TcdB contact PAM through hydrophobic interactions are conserved in TcsL, all six corresponding residues in TcsL form similar hydrophobic contacts with SEMA6A Met109 ( Figure 5 B and Table S3 ).
We experimentally validated the TcsL-SEMA6A interaction surface by first generating and purifying a variant of TcsL (TcsL 4mut ) that carried four mutations in core interacting residues (Cys1433Asp, Ile1434Lys, Ala1486Ser, and Tyr1596Arg) (shown in Figure 5 A). TcsL Cys1433, Ile1434, and Ala1486 form key hydrophobic interactions in the pocket accommodating SEMA6A Met109, whereas TcsL Tyr1596 interacts with several residues in the flexible loop of SEMA6A through hydrophobic interactions and through a hydrogen bond with SEMA6A Phe190 backbone amide ( Figure 5 A and Table S3 ). TcsL 4mut was highly soluble and retained its inositol hexaphosphate (IP6)-dependent autoprocessing activity in vitro , suggesting that it is properly folded ( Figure 5 C). However, TcsL 4mut was 2,500-fold less toxic in Vero cells than the wild-type TcsL, indicating that the four interface residues are physiologically relevant ( Figure 5 C). We then validated the relevance of SEMA Met109 in TcsL toxicity. We introduced 3xFLAG-tagged wild-type SEMA6A or Met109Asp mutant by lentiviral infection into SEMA6A/6B double knockout Hap1 cells and assessed their effect on TcsL toxicity. In contrast to wild-type SEMA6A, the Met109Asp mutant did not make SEMA6A/6B double knockout cells more sensitive to TcsL, although both mutants were expressed at similar levels ( Figure 5 D).
Our results establish that TcsL and TcdB have evolved to bind different host receptors through the same interacting region. Consistent with this, the surface is highly diverged between the two toxins: of the 25 SEMA6A-interacting residues in TcsL, only five are identical and nine are similar compared with those in TcdB. Conversely, of the 19 residues in TcdB that interact with FZD2 or PAM, only three are identical and eight are similar in TcsL. In stark contrast, 76% of non-interacting surface residues in TcdB are identical in TcsL (p < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test), indicating that the divergence is specific to the receptor-binding surface. This surface might represent a more general receptor-binding site in clostridial toxins, given that the divergence extends to all members of the family ( Figure S6 ). In particular, the five-stranded beta sheet that forms the base of the hydrophobic pocket for SEMA6A Met109 in TcsL and for the palmitoleic acid moiety in the FZD2-TcdB complex is highly variable between LCTs ( Figure 6 A and Figure S6 ).
We directly tested the role of the evolutionarily divergent surface in receptor specificity with recombinant proteins. As expected, TcsL 1285–1804 interacted with SEMA6A, and TcdB 1285–1804 formed a stable complex with FZD7 in size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 6 B). However, TcsL did not interact with FZD7, consistent with the extensive divergence of the receptor-binding interface ( Figure 6 B). We then generated a TcsL frizzled-binding domain (FBD) variant TcsL(FBD) 1285–1804 that had a TcdB-like interface, by changing 15 TcsL residues in the receptor-binding interface to those in TcdB ( Figure 6 C). Remarkably, these mutations were sufficient to switch TcsL binding specificity: the TcsL 1285–1804 (FBD) hybrid protein robustly interacted with FZD7 but no longer bound SEMA6A ( Figure 6 D). Thus, selective clustering of mutations on a single surface of the delivery domain of TcdB and TcsL explains the divergent receptor specificity of the two toxins.

Section: Discussion

Identifying the cellular receptors of bacterial toxins that are the primary determinants of human diseases is of major importance both for elucidating the fundamental strategies used by pathogens to cause disease and for informing the development of therapeutics to block their uptake. Our discovery and structural characterization of semaphorins as P. sordellii lethal toxin receptors provides a potential therapeutic avenue for these devastating infections and reveals how evolution has sculpted the receptor-binding interfaces of large clostridial toxins to recognize distinct host receptors.

The transmembrane protein semaphorin 6A repels embryonic sympathetic axons J. Neurosci. 2000; 20 :2638-2648 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and as such their role in toxin entry in endothelial cells might seem unexpected. However, semaphorins regulate several other cellular processes outside the central nervous system ( Neufeld et al., 2012 32. Neufeld, G. ∙ Sabag, A.D. ∙ Rabinovicz, N. ... Semaphorins in angiogenesis and tumor progression Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2 a006718–a006718 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Worzfeld and Offermanns, 2014 56. Worzfeld, T. ∙ Offermanns, S. Semaphorins and plexins as therapeutic targets Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13 :603-621 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, SEMA6A promotes angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in vascular endothelial cells, and SEMA6B positively regulates endothelial cell proliferation ( Kigel et al., 2011 25. Kigel, B. ∙ Rabinowicz, N. ∙ Varshavsky, A. ... Plexin-A4 promotes tumor progression and tumor angiogenesis by enhancement of VEGF and bFGF signaling Blood. 2011; 118 :4285-4296 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Segarra et al., 2012 44.

It seems that P. sordellii and TcsL have evolved to exploit the non-neuronal semaphorin function to their own advantage during infection. In canonical semaphorin-plexin signaling, semaphorins act as ligands for plexins either through cell-cell contacts or in cis . However, signaling can also occur through the reverse route where semaphorins are the receptors that induce downstream signaling events ( Haklai-Topper et al., 2010 18. Haklai-Topper, L. ∙ Mlechkovich, G. ∙ Savariego, D. ...

Reverse Signaling by Semaphorin-6A Regulates Cellular Aggregation and Neuronal Morphology PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0158686 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our cryo-EM structure of the TcsL-SEMA6A complex shows that the binding site of TcsL on SEMA6A significantly overlaps with the native Plexin A2 binding site ( Janssen et al., 2010 21. Janssen, B.J.C. ∙ Robinson, R.A. ∙ Pérez-Brangulí, F. ... Structural basis of semaphorin-plexin signalling Nature. 2010; 467 :1118-1122 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nogi et al., 2010 33. Nogi, T. ∙ Yasui, N. ∙ Mihara, E. ... Structural basis for semaphorin signalling through the plexin receptor Nature. 2010; 467 :1123-1127 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is highly unlikely that both ligands could simultaneously bind SEMA6A because of steric clashes. However, disruption of the plexin-semaphorin axis is unlikely to contribute to acute toxicity of TcsL. For example, Hap1 and Vero cells that are highly sensitive to the toxin do not express the Plexin A2 or A4 ( Figure S1 ), and we did not identify known downstream regulators of reverse SEMA6A signaling, such as Abl or Mena ( Perez-Branguli et al., 2016 36. Perez-Branguli, F. ∙ Zagar, Y. ∙ Shanley, D.K. ... Reverse Signaling by Semaphorin-6A Regulates Cellular Aggregation and Neuronal Morphology PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0158686 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), in our CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Future work can address whether disruption of this signaling axis signaling modulates TcsL toxicity in vivo .
SEMA6A and SEMA6B add to the list of proteins that have been identified as receptors or host factors for large clostridial toxins, alongside Frizzled, CSPG4, and Nectin3 for TcdB; LRP1 for TpeL; and sulfated glycosaminoglycans and LDLR for TcdA ( LaFrance et al., 2015 27. LaFrance, M.E. ∙ Farrow, M.A. ∙ Chandrasekaran, R. ... Identification of an epithelial cell receptor responsible for Clostridium difficile TcdB-induced cytotoxicity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Frizzled proteins are colonic epithelial receptors for C. difficile toxin B Nature. 2016; 538 :350-355 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 50. Tao, L. ∙ Tian, S. ∙ Zhang, J. ...

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 functions as the cellular receptor for Clostridium difficile toxin B Cell Res. 2015; 25 :157-168 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the high degree of conservation between all LCTs, we cannot exclude the possibility that TcsL also binds additional receptors on host cells. However, we have not identified additional factors in CRISPR/Cas9 screens in cells that do not express SEMA6A or SEMA6B. Moreover, if such receptors exist, they must be distinct from those of other LCTs.
TcsL shares almost 90% similarity with C. difficile cytotoxin TcdB, which binds Frizzled family receptors in the colonic epithelium ( Chen et al., 2018 8. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ... Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B Science. 2018; 360 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tao et al., 2016 49. Tao, L. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Meraner, P. ... Frizzled proteins are colonic epithelial receptors for C. difficile toxin B Nature. 2016; 538 :350-355 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous work had suggested that TcsL and TcdB use different receptors ( Chaves-Olarte et al., 1997 6. Chaves-Olarte, E. ∙ Weidmann, M. ∙ Eichel-Streiber, C. ... Toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile differ with respect to enzymatic potencies, cellular substrate specificities, and surface binding to cultured cells J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100 :1734-1741 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is consistent with their distinct target tissues during infection. Given the sequence conservation, one might have expected that their receptors are also related to each other. This was not the case: semaphorins and Frizzled receptors are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated. However, the cryo-EM structure of the TcsL-SEMA6A complex revealed that TcsL and TcdB use exactly the same region to interact with their cognate receptors. Comparison of the structures of TcsL and TcdB bound to their cognate receptors provides an elegant molecular explanation for the distinct receptor specificity: selective clustering of adaptive mutations in the receptor-binding interface. The high sequence diversity in this region between all clostridial toxins indicates that this interface is likely a more general receptor-binding site for these toxins. Indeed, the receptor-binding site of TpeL, a more distantly related clostridial toxin, has been mapped to a region that includes the hypervariable site ( Schorch et al., 2014 43. Schorch, B. ∙ Song, S. ∙ van Diemen, F.R. ... LRP1 is a receptor for Clostridium perfringens TpeL toxin indicating a two-receptor model of clostridial glycosylating toxins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6431-6436 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The striking diversity in the receptor-binding specificity of clostridial toxins is reminiscent of receptor-binding proteins of several viruses. For example, closely related coronaviruses can bind evolutionarily unrelated host receptors through highly variable loops in the spike protein ( Wong et al., 2017 55. Wong, A.H.M. ∙ Tomlinson, A.C.A. ∙ Zhou, D. ... Receptor-binding loops in alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1735 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2020 57. Wu, F. ∙ Zhao, S. ∙ Yu, B. ... A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China Nature. 2020; Crossref Scopus (7705) Google Scholar ). Thus, in a similar manner to rapidly evolving viral proteins, a sculptable receptor-binding interface in large clostridial toxins provides an evolutionarily flexible platform that might allow pathogenic clostridial species to adapt to and attack novel host organisms and tissues.

The cryo-EM maps of the TcsL1285-1804/SEMA6A complex and unliganded SEMA6A have been deposited to the EMDB under accession numbers EMD-21898 and EMD-21899, respectively, and the TcsL1285-1804/SEMA6A model to the PDB under accession number 6WTS.
Animal husbandry, ethical handling of mice and all animal work were carried out according to guidelines approved by Canadian Council on Animal Care and under protocols approved by the Centre for Phenogenomics Animal Care Committee (23-0350H). Female C67/Bl6J mice, 8 weeks of age, were intraperitoneally injected with TcsL together with mouse Sema6a-Fc, mouse Sema6c-Fc, or BSA. Treatment-naive, littermate female mice were group-housed and randomly assigned to experimental groups. In brief, 15 ng of TcsL was mixed with a 1000-fold molar excess of each protein at 4°C on a rotator for one h prior to injection. Four h after intoxication, animals were euthanized and fluid present in the thoracic cavity was collected for analysis. For immunohistochemistry, lung tissue was fixed 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, processed through an ethanol series to xylene and then paraffin using a Leica ASP300 automatic tissue processor and embedded in paraffin wax using Leica Histocore Arcadia H. Samples were sectioned at 4.5 μm with a Leica RM2255 semi-automatic microtome. Slides for IHC were dewaxed, rehydrated and sections were treated with 3% H 2 O 2 in PBS to kill endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieval was performed using a 10 mM Tris/1mM EDTA/0.05% Tween 20 (pH 9) buffer solution in a microwave for 15 min. Primary antibody was applied at 4°C overnight using SEMA6A (R&D, AF1615, goat, 1:100 dilution) and SEMA6B (R&D, AF2094, goat, 1:100 dilution). Rabbit anti-goat secondary (Vector Labs BA-1000) was applied for 30 min followed by ABC regent (Vector Labs PK-6100) for 25 min and developed with DAB (Vector Labs SK-4100) for 4 min or less. Tissue was counterstained with Harris Hematoxylin (HHHS-128, Sigma) for 8 min and mounted with Shur Mount (Electron Microscopy Sciences 17991-01). Stained slides were digitized at 40x using a Nanozoomer 2.0 HT (Hamamatsu Photonics) and images of stained samples were analyzed using NPD.view2 software (Hamamatsu U12388-01).
All cell lines were grown at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Vero-NlucP cells stably express a destabilized nanoluciferase (Promega) were generated by infecting Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81; female cell line) with a lentivirus expressing nanoluciferase with a C-terminal PEST sequence. Stable clones were selected by puromycin and limiting dilution. These cells are referred to as Vero-NlucP. Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Hulec-5a human lung microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from ATCC (CRL-3244; male) and cultured in Vascular Cell Basal Medium (ATCC PCS-100-030) with the Endothelial Cell Growth Kit-VEGF (ATCC PCS-100-041). Hap1 cells were purchased from Horizon Discovery (C631; male) and cultured in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). HeLa Kyoto cells (female) used in this study were a gift from the Cheeseman laboratory (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA) and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293F cells used in this study were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (R79007; female) and cultured in GIBCO FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium. Cell lines obtained from commercial sources were not further authenticated. HeLa Kyoto cells were authenticated with STR profiling (GenePrint 24 System, Promega) at The Centre for Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto.
50 million Hap1 cells were infected with TKOv3 library at 200-fold library coverage at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3. The infected cells were selected with 2 μg/mL puromycin for 3 days (T0) and maintained at a minimum of 100-fold gRNA library coverage at any time point. Cells were passaged until the fourth day (T4) to allow sufficient time for protein turnover. 7 million cells were seeded into two 10 cm plates per condition and allowed to recover overnight after trypsinization. At T5, TcsL was added at a final concentration of 0.1 nM or 1 nM, and the cells were further incubated for 48 h. At T7, cells were washed with 1xPBS and allowed to repopulate in normal growth media (IMDM/10% FBS). The untreated population of cells (negative controls) were passaged every three days in parallel. The medium of toxin treated cells were replenished every 3 days. Once surviving colonies were visible, cells were trypsinized and re-seeded to facilitate repopulation. Once the toxin treated cells reached 100% confluence, the cells were collected with the corresponding untreated population. Genomic DNA was extracted from the frozen pellets using QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The gRNA sequences were PCR amplified from the extracted genomic DNA. Each amplified sample was then barcoded and processed on Illumina Next-seq high-output mode at a read depth of at least 5 million reads per sample. MAGeCK software ( Li et al., 2014 28. Li, W. ∙ Xu, H. ∙ Xiao, T. ... MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens Genome Biology. 2014; 15 :554 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to generate rankings for positively enriched genes.
The gRNAs targeting SEMA6A, SEMA6B, SEMA6C, SEMA6D and UGP2 were chosen from TKOv3 library and were cloned into pX459 (Addgene plasmid #62988; a gift from Feng Zhang) and lentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene plasmid #52961; a gift from Feng Zhang). Plasmids were transfected into HAP1 cells seeded on a 6-well plate with Turbofectin (OriGene) following the manufacturer’s protocol. One day post-transfection, the medium was changed to medium containing 2 μg/mL puromycin and was further selected for 3 days. Cells were washed and moved to a 10 cm plate with fresh growth medium with no antibiotics.
Wild-type and knock-out cells were seeded on a 96-well plate a day before toxin application at < 40% confluency. Toxins were serially diluted in 1xPBS with 10% glycerol before applying to cells. Cells were incubated with toxins for 24 to 48 h. Cell viability was measured either using AlamarBlue dye (Invitrogen) or CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
For ectopic expression of SEMA6A, SEMA6B, SEMA6C, and SEMA6D, full-length genes were cloned into a pLenti6.2 plasmid with a C-terminal FLAG and V5 tags. Lentiviruses were packaged by transfecting the lentiviral plasmid with VSV-G and psPAX packaging plasmids into HEK293T cells. Virus-containing media was collected three days post-transfection. The media containing packaged virus was added to HAP1-SEMA6A knock-out cells in a 1:10 ratio and selected on 10 μg/mL blasticidin for 7 to 10 days. The expression of the target construct was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting with an anti-FLAG-HRP antibody (Sigma).
The mutation in SEMA6A was generated with oligonucleotides containing the mutation of interest and a standard site-directed mutagenesis protocol, followed by digestion of the template plasmid with DpnI (NEB). Mutations in TcsL(1285-1804) and TcsL were made by synthesizing the mutant fragment and cloning by NebBuilder (NEB).
Vero-NlucP cells were plated at 4000 cells/well in a white-walled clear bottom 96-well plate (Corning) and incubated overnight to attach. For toxicity experiments, TcsL was added at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 24 or 48 h (indicated in the figures) at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Nanoluciferase levels were measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For SEMA6 competition experiments, recombinant SEMA6 proteins were added immediately before TcsL at the indicated concentrations and the assay proceeded as above. Cell viability experiments with Vero cells (without Nluc reporter) were conducted exactly as above, except 10 μl PrestoBlue reagent was added to all wells, and fluorescence was read after 4 h on a plate reader (Molecular Devices M5e).
A total of 3 μg TcsL or TcsL 4mut was incubated with the indicated amounts of inositol hexakisphosphate in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT for 3 h at 37°C. Samples were analyzed via SDS-PAGE.
Hulec-5a human lung microvascular endothelial cells were plated in white-walled clear-bottom 96-well plates at 4,000 cells/well and left to attach overnight. TcsL and/or SEMA6 proteins were added as indicated. For cell viability experiments, cells were incubated for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO 2 and cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For cell rounding experiments, media was replaced by complete media containing 1 μM CellTracker Orange CMRA (Molecular Probes). After 60 min, excess dye was removed by media exchange with complete media. Cells were then incubated with 5 pM TcsL and various concentrations of SEMA6 proteins as indicated. Cells were incubated for 10 h before imaging. CellTracker-labeled cells were evaluated on a Cellomics ArrayScan VTI HCS reader (Thermo Scientific) using the target acquisition mode, a 10x objective, and a sample rate of 150 objects per well. After recording all image data, the cell rounding and shrinking effects of TcsL intoxication were calculated using the cell rounding index (CRI), a combined measure of the length-to-width ratio (LWR) and area parameters. Dose response curves were plotted and fit to a sigmoidal function (variable slope) to determine EC 50 using Prism software (GraphPad Software).
Recombinant human SEMA6A, SEMA6B, SEMA6C, and SEMA6D ectodomains fused to Fc domain were purchased from R&D Systems. Plasmid pHis1522 encoding His-tagged TcsL was synthesized and codon optimized for Bacillus megaterium (Genscript). To express and isolate recombinant TcsL, transformed B. megaterium was inoculated into LB containing tetracycline and grown to an A 600 of 0.7, followed by overnight xylose induction at 37°C. Bacterial pellets were collected, resuspended with 20 mM Tris pH 8, 0.5 M NaCl, and passed twice through an EmulsiFlex C3 microfluidizer (Avestin) at 15,000 psi, then clarified by centrifuging at 18,000 x g for 20 min. TcsL was purified by nickel affinity chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography using HisTrap FF and HiTrap Q columns (GE Healthcare), respectively. Fractions containing TcsL were verified by SDS-PAGE, then pooled and diafiltered with a 100,000 MWCO ultrafiltration device (Corning) into 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. Finally, glycerol was added to 15% v/v, the protein concentration was estimated by A 280 (using extinction coefficient 300205), and stored at −80°C.
TcsL fragments (1285-1804) and all mutants thereof were synthesized (IDT) and cloned into pET Champion vector with an N-terminal 6xHIS-SUMO-Strep-TEV sequence and a C-terminal TEV-6xHIS. Positive clones were verified by sequencing. NiCo21 (DE3) competent E. coli (NEB) were transformed and inoculated in LB media with kanamycin and grown to an A 600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 23°C. Cells were pelleted and protein was purified similarly to TcsL, except after nickel affinity chromatography, they were passed through a size exclusion column and eluted into 20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl. Mouse Sema6A-Fc and Sema6c-Fc expression constructs were a gift from Woj Wojtowicz (Addgene plasmids 72163 and 72167, respectively) and human SEMA6A was gene-synthesized (GeneArt). All SEMA6 constructs were transiently expressed in suspension HEK293F cells. Proteins were purified by either Protein A affinity or by using ion exchange chromatography (MonoQ 10/100 GL column, GE Healthcare) with a 0 mM–1 M NaCl gradient. These steps were followed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase, GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 9.0 and 150 mM NaCl buffer.
Recombinant FZD7 was expressed and purified as previously described ( Raman et al., 2019 40. Raman, S. ∙ Beilschmidt, M. ∙ To, M. ... Structure-guided design fine-tunes pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and antitumor profile of multispecific frizzled antibodies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :6812-6817 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a human FZD7 (residues 42-179)-mVenus construct was transiently expressed in suspension HEK293F cells and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The protein was eluted with an increasing gradient of imidazole with a maximum concentration of 500 mM, in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol. This step was followed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase, GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl buffer. To test the formation of toxin-receptor complexes, TcsL1285-1804, TcsL (FBD)1285-1804 and TcdB1285-1804 (positive control) were mixed with 5-fold molar excess of SEMA6A or FZD7 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. This was followed by gel filtration chromatography in 20 mM Tris pH 9.0, 150 mM NaCl buffer.
To determine the binding kinetics for recombinant His-tagged TcsL1285-1804 and human SEMA6A, BLI experiments were performed on an Octet Red96 instrument (FortéBio) at 25°C. All proteins were diluted in kinetics buffer (1xPBS pH 7.4, 0.01% (w/v) BSA, 0.002% (v/v) Tween-20). After 10-30 μg/mL of His-tagged TcsL1285-1804 was immobilized on Ni-NTA sensors, the baseline was established for 60 s. Subsequently, the loaded biosensors were dipped into wells containing serial dilutions of human SEMA6A, to determine the rate of association. Sensors were then dipped back into kinetics buffer to establish the dissociation rate. The curves were fitted to a 1:1 binding model and the apparent dissociation constant (K D ) was evaluated using FortéBio’s Data Analysis software 9.0. Reported values represent the average of four independent experiments with standard error of the mean (SEM).
TcsL 1285-1804 was combined with excess of SEMA6A and purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase, GE Healthcare) in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 and 50 mM NaCl. Fractions containing the complex were concentrated to 0.12 mg/mL and proteins were crosslinked by addition of 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of Tris-HCl pH 7.0 to a final concentration of 50 mM. Subsequently, the complex was concentrated to 0.9 mg/mL, spun down for 30 min at 14,500 x g and directly used for cryo-EM grid preparation.
Homemade holey gold grids ( Marr et al., 2014 31. Marr, C.R. ∙ Benlekbir, S. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. Fabrication of carbon films with ∼ 500nm holes for cryo-EM with a direct detector device J. Struct. Biol. 2014; 185 :42-47 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) were glow discharged in air for 15 s before use. TcsL-SEMA6A (3 μl, 0.9 mg/mL) was applied to grids, blotted for 12 s, and frozen in a mixture of liquid ethane and propane ( Tivol et al., 2008 53. Tivol, W.F. ∙ Briegel, A. ∙ Jensen, G.J. An improved cryogen for plunge freezing Microsc. Microanal. 2008; 14 :375-379 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a modified FEI Vitrobot (maintained at 4°C and 100% humidity). Data collection was performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan Krios G3 operated at 300 kV with a Falcon 4 camera automated with the EPU software. A nominal magnification of 75,000 (calibrated pixel size of 1.03 Å) and defocus range between 1.6 and 2.2 μm were used for data collection. Exposures were fractionated as movies of 30 frames with an exposure rate of 5 electrons/pixel/second and total exposure of 45.2 electrons/Å 2 .
A total of 4,581 raw movies were obtained for the TcsL-SEMA6A sample. Image processing was carried out in cryoSPARC v2 ( Punjani et al., 2017 39. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3664) PubMed Google Scholar ). Motion correction was performed with Patch Motion algorithm and CTF parameters were estimated from the average of aligned movie frames with Patch CTF. 3,896,638 particle images were selected by template matching and individual particle images were corrected for beam-induced motion using local motion algorithm ( Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015 42. Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Brubaker, M.A. Alignment of cryo-EM movies of individual particles by optimization of image translations J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :188-195 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) within cryoSPARC v2. Ab initio structure determination and classification revealed that ∼50% particle images corresponded to a SEMA6A dimer and the remaining particles to a SEMA6 dimer-TcsL complex. The overwhelming majority of particles for the SEMA6A-TcsL complex had one TcsL molecule bound to the SEMA6A dimer, with no evidence of two TcsL molecules bound to the dimer that could be clearly identified for this cross-linked sample.
Since the TcsL-SEMA6A particles exhibited partially preferred orientation on vitrified cryo-EM grids, we collected an additional dataset of 2,843 images under 40° tilt ( Lyumkis, 2019 30. Lyumkis, D. Challenges and opportunities in cryo-EM single-particle analysis J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :5181-5197 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tan et al., 2017 48. Tan, Y.Z. ∙ Baldwin, P.R. ∙ Davis, J.H. ... Addressing preferred specimen orientation in single-particle cryo-EM through tilting Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :793-796 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data collection and image processing parameters were identical with untilted dataset. 1,465,298 particle images were selected by template matching and merged with the previously obtained dataset of 3,896,638 particle images. Multiple rounds of heterogeneous refinement followed by non-uniform refinement resulted in a 3.3 Å resolution map of the TcsL-SEMA6A complex (179,188 particle images) and a 3.1 Å resolution map of unliganded SEMA6A 281,207 particle images). To improve the quality of the final TcsL-SEMA6A map, density modification was used in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Terwilliger et al., 2019 52. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Ludtke, S.J. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Improvement of cryo-EM maps by density modification Biochemistry, 2019 Crossref Google Scholar ).
An initial model for TcsL was created using the Phyre2 server ( Kelley et al., 2015 24. Kelley, L.A. ∙ Mezulis, S. ∙ Yates, C.M. ... The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :845-858 Crossref Scopus (7036) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the TcdB crystal structure (PDB: 6C0B ) as a reference. The atomic coordinates of SEMA6A dimer (PDB: 3OKW ) were manually fitted into the density map using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 37. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32501) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate a starting model, followed by manual rebuilding using Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 13. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19616) PubMed Google Scholar ). All models were refined using the phenix.real_space_refine ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18121) PubMed Google Scholar ) with secondary structure and geometry restraints. The final models were evaluated by MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 7. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (10875) PubMed Google Scholar ). Statistics of the map reconstruction and model refinement are presented in Table S2 .
TcsL intoxication experiments were conducted in triplicate unless otherwise noted. All figures show arithmetic means of replicate experiments and error bars denote standard deviations. Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the difference between receptor-binding domain conservation and the non-receptor binding surface residues.
