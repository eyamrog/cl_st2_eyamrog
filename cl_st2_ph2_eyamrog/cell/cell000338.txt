Title: Nonpeptidergic neurons suppress mast cells via glutamate to maintain skin homeostasis


Abstract: Summary

Cutaneous mast cells mediate numerous skin inflammatory processes and have anatomical and functional associations with sensory afferent neurons. We reveal that epidermal nerve endings from a subset of sensory nonpeptidergic neurons expressing MrgprD are reduced by the absence of Langerhans cells. Loss of epidermal innervation or ablation of MrgprD-expressing neurons increased expression of a mast cell gene module, including the activating receptor, Mrgprb2 , resulting in increased mast cell degranulation and cutaneous inflammation in multiple disease models. Agonism of MrgprD-expressing neurons reduced expression of module genes and suppressed mast cell responses. MrgprD-expressing neurons released glutamate which was increased by MrgprD agonism. Inhibiting glutamate release or glutamate receptor binding yielded hyperresponsive mast cells with a genomic state similar to that in mice lacking MrgprD-expressing neurons. These data demonstrate that MrgprD-expressing neurons suppress mast cell hyperresponsiveness and skin inflammation via glutamate release, thereby revealing an unexpected neuroimmune mechanism maintaining cutaneous immune homeostasis.

Section: Introduction

Skin is an immunologically active barrier tissue that is exposed to a wide variety of microbial pathogens and environmental insults. In response to microbial-derived products or other exogenous triggers, skin-resident cells of the innate and adaptive immune system respond through the secreted factors to recruit immune effector cells and promote local inflammatory responses ( Kashem et al., 2017 32. Kashem, S.W. ∙ Haniffa, M. ∙ Kaplan, D.H. Antigen-Presenting Cells in the Skin Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35 :469-499 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). The skin is also densely innervated by sensory afferent neurons ( Owens and Lumpkin, 2014 48. Owens, D.M. ∙ Lumpkin, E.A. Diversification and specialization of touch receptors in skin Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4 :4 Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar ). Recently, it has become appreciated that unmyelinated C-fibers expressing TRPV1 sense noxious stimuli, resulting in painful sensation, and play a key role in modulating cutaneous immunity through release of neuropeptides ( Baral et al., 2019 3. Baral, P. ∙ Udit, S. ∙ Chiu, I.M. Pain and immunity: implications for host defence Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :433-447 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the skin, this neuron subset can be directly activated by products derived from pathogens such as S. aureus , C. albicans , and S. pyogenes and is both necessary and sufficient to provide host defense against C. albicans infection ( Chiu et al., 2013 9. Chiu, I.M. ∙ Heesters, B.A. ∙ Ghasemlou, N. ...

Blocking Neuronal Signaling to Immune Cells Treats Streptococcal Invasive Infection Cell. 2018; 173 :1083-1097.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, house dust mite (HDM) antigens activate TRPV1-expressing neurons, resulting in release of the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and subsequent mast cell (MC) degranulation ( Serhan et al., 2019 62. Serhan, N. ∙ Basso, L. ∙ Sibilano, R. ... House dust mites activate nociceptor-mast cell clusters to drive type 2 skin inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :1435-1443 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, TRPV1-expressing neurons appear to play an obligate role in the development of multiple cutaneous inflammatory responses.
The skin is also innervated by other types of sensory neurons, including a nonpeptidergic subset identified based on expression of MrgprD (Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor D). In mouse, MrgprD-expressing neurons are distinct from TRPV1-expressing neurons and, along with other sensory neuron subsets, express the ion channels TRPA1, which is a broad “chemosensor,” and P2rxR3, which is an ATP receptor ( Beaudry et al., 2017 5.

MrgprD-expressing neurons innervate the epidermis and are thought to be polymodal sensing itch, pain, and mechanical stimuli ( Cavanaugh et al., 2009 7. Cavanaugh, D.J. ∙ Lee, H. ∙ Lo, L. ...

Facilitation of MrgprD by TRP-A1 promotes neuropathic pain FASEB J. 2019; 33 :1360-1373 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), their functions in modulating immune responses remain to be explored.
Connective tissue MCs are skin-resident immune cells that quickly respond to allergens via cross-linking of the FcεRI, resulting in release of granules containing many preformed inflammatory meditators ( Galli and Tsai, 2012 19. Galli, S.J. ∙ Tsai, M. IgE and mast cells in allergic disease Nat. Med. 2012; 18 :693-704 Crossref Scopus (1335) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, MCs were shown to express Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor B2 (MrgprB2), a receptor required for MC activation and granule release in response to pseudo-allergens, HDMs, and bacterial quorum-sensing molecules ( McNeil et al., 2015 43.

Immunol. 2019; 20 :1435-1443 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). MrgprB2 agonism was sufficient to augment host defense against dermonecrotic S. aureus infection ( Arifuzzaman et al., 2019 1. Arifuzzaman, M. ∙ Mobley, Y.R. ∙ Choi, H.W. ... MRGPR-mediated activation of local mast cells clears cutaneous bacterial infection and protects against reinfection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaav0216 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to sensing exogenous ligands, MrgprB2 is also a receptor for endogenous ligands. MrgprX2, the human ortholog of MrgprB2, is a receptor for the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, a proteolytic cleavage product of cathelicidin ( Subramanian et al., 2011 64. Subramanian, H. ∙ Gupta, K. ∙ Guo, Q. ... Mas-related gene X2 (MrgX2) is a novel G protein-coupled receptor for the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in human mast cells: resistance to receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization J.

LL-37-induced human mast cell activation through G protein-coupled receptor MrgX2 Int. Immunopharmacol. 2017; 49 :6-12 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). MC activation by LL37, likely via MrgprX2 ligation, is a key component of rosacea pathogenesis ( Choi et al., 2019 10. Choi, J.E. ∙ Werbel, T. ∙ Wang, Z. ...

Dermatol. 2014; 134 :2728-2736 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). MrgprB2 is also a receptor for SP, a neuropeptide released by many TRPV1-expressing neurons that is required for neurogenic inflammation and pain as well as the recruitment of innate immune cells to sites of injury ( Azimi et al., 2016 2.

Immunol. 2019; 20 :1435-1443 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is not known if MC responses can be modulated by sensory afferent neurons other than those expressing TRPV1.
Langerhans cells (LC) are epidermal-resident antigen-presenting cells that share many functions with dendritic cells but are ontogenetically closely related to macrophages ( Ginhoux et al., 2006 21. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Tacke, F. ∙ Angeli, V. ... Langerhans cells arise from monocytes in vivo Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7 :265-273 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hoeffel et al., 2012 24. Hoeffel, G. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Greter, M. ... Adult Langerhans cells derive predominantly from embryonic fetal liver monocytes with a minor contribution of yolk sac-derived macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :1167-1181 Crossref Scopus (574) PubMed Google Scholar ). The two models used to functionally test in vivo LC requirement involve mice with genetic LC-specific expression of either the diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (DTR), which allow for inducible LC ablation following DT administration, or the active DT subunit A (DTA), which results in constitutive LC ablation ( Bobr et al., 2010 6. Bobr, A. ∙ Olvera-Gomez, I. ∙ Igyarto, B.Z. ... Acute ablation of Langerhans cells enhances skin immune responses J. Immunol. 2010; 185 :4724-4728 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaplan, 2017 27. Kaplan, D.H. Ontogeny and function of murine epidermal Langerhans cells Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :1068-1075 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaplan et al., 2005 28. Kaplan, D.H. ∙ Jenison, M.C. ∙ Saeland, S. ... Epidermal langerhans cell-deficient mice develop enhanced contact hypersensitivity Immunity. 2005; 23 :611-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contact hypersensitivity (CHS) to epicutaneously applied hapten, a mouse model of human allergic contact dermatitis, is commonly employed to probe LC function ( Kaplan et al., 2012 30. Kaplan, D.H. ∙ Igyártó, B.Z. ∙ Gaspari, A.A. Early immune events in the induction of allergic contact dermatitis Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :114-124 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar ). LC have been found to be both required for CHS responses and required to suppress CHS response depending in large part on the method of LC depletion and CHS methodology ( Kaplan et al., 2008 29. Kaplan, D.H. ∙ Kissenpfennig, A. ∙ Clausen, B.E. Insights into Langerhans cell function from Langerhans cell ablation models Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38 :2369-2376 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). LC are also suggested to suppress irritant dermatitis responses in humans and mice with reduced number of LC due to dietary zinc deficiency ( Kawamura et al., 2012 33. Kawamura, T. ∙ Ogawa, Y. ∙ Nakamura, Y. ... Severe dermatitis with loss of epidermal Langerhans cells in human and mouse zinc deficiency J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122 :722-732 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this study, we examined functional interactions between immune cells and nonpeptidergic nerve fibers in skin of the mouse. We began by exploring the requirement of LC in suppression of rapid irritant dermatitis responses to epicutaneous application of croton oil. Such responses to the irritant were exaggerated by the long-term ablation of LC, which in turn reduced epidermal innervation by MrgprD-expressing neurons. Notably, croton oil responses were dependent on MC degranulation, SP, and MrgprB2. Ablation of MrgprD-expressing neurons or LC resulted in MC hyperresponsiveness across multiple in vivo disease models. We reveal the likely molecular underpinnings of the hyperresponsive MC state by discovering an Mrgprb2 -containing MC gene module whose expression is enhanced by ablation of MrgprD-expressing neurons or LC and counter-regulated by the activation of MrgprD-expressing neurons. Finally, we show that glutamate released from MrgprD-expressing neurons and its sensing by MCs reduces expression of many genes contained within the MC module and induces a state of reduced MC responsiveness. These data demonstrate that MrgprD-expressing neurons can modulate cutaneous immune responses and maintain MC homeostasis during the steady state, thereby revealing an unexpected neuroimmune pathway linking LC, nonpeptidergic neurons, and MCs.

Section: Results

To determine whether epidermal LC are required to suppress irritant dermatitis, we tested the effects of epicutaneous application of 1% croton oil on the ears of LC DTA mice that have a constitutive absence of LC and littermate (wild-type [WT]) controls ( Bobr et al., 2010 6. Bobr, A. ∙ Olvera-Gomez, I. ∙ Igyarto, B.Z. ... Acute ablation of Langerhans cells enhances skin immune responses J. Immunol. 2010; 185 :4724-4728 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaplan et al., 2005 28. Kaplan, D.H. ∙ Jenison, M.C. ∙ Saeland, S. ... Epidermal langerhans cell-deficient mice develop enhanced contact hypersensitivity Immunity. 2005; 23 :611-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moon et al., 2001 45. Moon, S.H. ∙ Seo, K.I. ∙ Han, W.S. ... Pathological findings in cumulative irritation induced by SLS and croton oil in hairless mice Contact Dermat. 2001; 44 :240-245 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed a brisk response as measured by increased ear thickness that peaked at 6 h and largely resolved by 24 h ( Figure 1 A). LC DTA mice showed markedly increased ear thickness at 6 h compared with WT mice that decayed with kinetics similar to WT mice ( Figures 1 A and 1B). We also examined croton oil responses in Itgb6 −/− Itgb8 ΔKC mice ( Itgb6 −/− K14 Cre Itgb8 fl/fl ) that constitutively lack LC through a DT-independent mechanism ( Mohammed et al., 2016 44. Mohammed, J. ∙ Beura, L.K. ∙ Bobr, A. ... Stromal cells control the epithelial residence of DCs and memory T cells by regulated activation of TGF-β Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :414-421 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Itgb6 −/− Itgb8 ΔKC mice developed exaggerated croton oil responses similar to those seen in LC DTA mice ( Figure 1 C). We next examined croton oil responses in LC DTR mice that allow for inducible DT-mediated ablation of LC. Unexpectedly, short-term ablation of LC by administration of DT 3 days prior to croton oil challenge had no effect ( Figure 1 D). In contrast, long-term ablation of LC through weekly DT injections starting 30 days prior to croton application resulted in increased ear thickness. Thus, the absence of LC for at least 30 days prior to application of croton oil resulted in exaggerated irritant dermatitis.
To identify the mechanism driving exaggerated croton oil responses in long-term LC-deficient mice, we compared the transcriptomes of whole-ear tissue from untreated LC DTA mice (long-term LC ablation) or LC DTR mice 3 days after DT administration (short-term LC ablation). LC were efficiently ablated in both mice ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Differentially expressed transcripts from unstimulated LC DTA and LC DTR skin showed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) enrichment for a dermal MC signature in LC DTA mice ( Dwyer et al., 2016 17. Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Barrett, N.A. ∙ Austen, K.F., Immunological Genome Project Consortium Expression profiling of constitutive mast cells reveals a unique identity within the immune system Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :878-887 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ), but not other immune cell types ( Figure S1 C; Table S1 ). These data suggest that MC numbers and/or their susceptibility to activation are altered by the long-term absence of LC.
To distinguish between the aforementioned possibilities, we compared histologic sections of ears 6 h after croton oil application. LC DTA ears showed increased edema compared to WT mice ( Figures 1 E and 1F) and a minimal inflammatory infiltrate that was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure S1 D). We found that the number of degranulated MCs following croton oil treatment was increased in LC DTA compared to WT mice ( Figures 1 G and 1H), but the number of dermal MCs and the response to FcεRI-mediated activation in a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay were equivalent in both groups ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Mcpt5-Cre × Rosa.26.DTA (MC DTA ) mice ( Scholten et al., 2008 61. Scholten, J. ∙ Hartmann, K. ∙ Gerbaulet, A. ... Mast cell-specific Cre/loxP-mediated recombination in vivo Transgenic Res. 2008; 17 :307-315 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), which lack MCs ( Figure S1 E), showed greatly attenuated croton-oil-mediated ear swelling, and the exaggerated croton oil response in LC-deficient mice was absent in mice lacking both LC and MCs (MC DTA × LC DTA mice) ( Figure 1 K). From these data, we conclude that the long-term absence of LC does not alter dermal MC numbers but results in their enhanced degranulation in response to croton oil via a FcεRI-independent mechanism.
Recently, MrgprB2, which is expressed exclusively by MCs, was shown to mediate FcεR-independent MC degranulation in response to a variety of exogenous (e.g., antibiotics and HDMs) and endogenous (e.g., substance P, LL37, or β-defensins) ligands ( Azimi et al., 2016 2.

Immunol. 2017; 47 :1949-1958 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). HDMs have been shown to induce MC degranulation in skin through a mechanism in which HDM-activated TRPV1-expressing neurons release SP that activates MrgprB2 expressed on MCs ( Serhan et al., 2019 62. Serhan, N. ∙ Basso, L. ∙ Sibilano, R. ... House dust mites activate nociceptor-mast cell clusters to drive type 2 skin inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :1435-1443 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the croton oil response requires MCs, we hypothesized that croton-oil-mediated inflammation could also involve SP and MrgprB2. We observed that the croton oil response as measured by ear thickness 6 h after application was reduced in SP-deficient ( Tac1 −/− ) and Mrgprb2 −/− -deficient mice ( Figure 1 L). To more directly assay MC responses, we measured extravasation of Evans blue dye 20 min after application of croton oil. Dye extravasation was reduced in Tac1 −/− and Mrgprb2 −/− mice but increased in LC DTA mice ( Figure 1 M). Importantly, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of LC DTA ear tissue revealed Mrgprb2 transcripts to be significantly increased ( Table S1 ). We confirmed increased Mrgprb2 transcript expression in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted dermal MCs isolated from LC DTA , but not from WT or 3-day DT-treated LC DTR mice ( Figure 1 N). Finally, we compared MC degranulation in response to compound 48/80, a MrgprB2 ligand ( McNeil et al., 2015 43. McNeil, B.D. ∙ Pundir, P. ∙ Meeker, S. ... Identification of a mast-cell-specific receptor crucial for pseudo-allergic drug reactions Nature. 2015; 519 :237-241 Crossref Scopus (922) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed increased Evans blue dye extravasation and reduced avidin staining of MC granules in LC DTA compared with WT or LC DTR mice, consistent with increased expression and activity of Mrgprb2 in the long-term absence of LC ( Figures 1 O and S1 F). From these data, we conclude that croton-oil-mediated irritant dermatitis involves SP- and MrgprB2-mediated MC activation. Furthermore, long-term absence of LC results in increased expression of Mrgprb2 by dermal MCs and their enhanced activation to MrgprB2 ligands.
Both LC and MCs have well-known anatomic associations with sensory afferent neurons ( Hosoi et al., 1993 25. Hosoi, J. ∙ Murphy, G.F. ∙ Egan, C.L. ... Regulation of Langerhans cell function by nerves containing calcitonin gene-related peptide Nature. 1993; 363 :159-163 Crossref Scopus (573) PubMed Google Scholar ; Serhan et al., 2019 62. Serhan, N. ∙ Basso, L. ∙ Sibilano, R. ... House dust mites activate nociceptor-mast cell clusters to drive type 2 skin inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :1435-1443 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that the heightened MC responses observed upon the long-term ablation of LC could involve dysregulation of MC-neuronal communication. A reduction in the number of epidermal free nerve endings has been reported following long-term ablation of LC ( Doss and Smith, 2014 14. Doss, A.L. ∙ Smith, P.G. Langerhans cells regulate cutaneous innervation density and mechanical sensitivity in mouse footpad Neurosci. Lett. 2014; 578 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed this finding by comparing the density of PGP9.5 immunolabeled nerve fibers in epidermal whole mounts from control and LC DTA mice ( Figure 2 A). As expected, LC DTA showed a notable reduction in epidermal nerve fiber density. Quantification of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENFs) by immunofluorescent microscopy of transverse sections showed reduced numbers only with long-term LC depletion (LC DTA , 30-day DT-treated LC DTR ), but not short-term LC ablation (3-day DT-treated LC DTR ) ( Figures 2 B, 2C, and S2 A). Most epidermal nerve fibers expressed the GDNF family receptor α2 (GFRα2), which is primarily expressed by nonpeptidergic cutaneous neurons ( Lindfors et al., 2006 38. Lindfors, P.H. ∙ Võikar, V. ∙ Rossi, J. ... Deficient nonpeptidergic epidermis innervation and reduced inflammatory pain in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha2 knock-out mice J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :1953-1960 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), while few were positive for GFRα3, a receptor expressed by peptidergic neurons ( Figures 2 D, 2E, and S2 B). LC DTA skin also showed reduced epidermal GFRα2-positive fibers in epidermal and transverse sections ( Figures 2 D and S2 C). In addition, the relative number of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-positive nerve fibers was unaffected in LC DTA mice ( Figure S2 D). Based on these data, we conclude that long-term LC ablation results in reduced epidermal GFRα2-positive, nonpeptidergic nerve endings.
Cutaneous MrgprD-expressing neurons are a distinct subset of C-fibers that express GFRα2 and innervate the epidermis ( Zylka et al., 2005 78. Zylka, M.J. ∙ Rice, F.L. ∙ Anderson, D.J.

To determine whether MrgprD-expressing neurons are reduced in the absence of LC, we generated Mrgprd -Cre × Rosa.26.tdTomato ( Mrgprd TdT ) mice and bred them with LC DTA mice. We observed numerous tdTomoato (TdT)-positive nerve fibers in the epidermis. TdT-positive fibers were also closely associated with dermal MCs, consistent with a published report ( Serhan et al., 2019 62. Serhan, N. ∙ Basso, L. ∙ Sibilano, R. ... House dust mites activate nociceptor-mast cell clusters to drive type 2 skin inflammation Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :1435-1443 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 F). Importantly, long-term deletion of LC resulted in reduction of the TdT-positive nerve fibers ( Figures 2 G and 2H).
To determine whether ablation of MrgprD-expressing neurons could alter MC function, thereby linking LC ablation with increased MC activation, we bred Mrgprd -Cre mice with Rosa.26.DTR mice to generate Mrgprd DTR mice. These mice allow for the inducible ablation of MgprD-expressing neurons following administration of DT for 3–4 weeks ( Pogorzala et al., 2013 50. Pogorzala, L.A. ∙ Mishra, S.K. ∙ Hoon, M.A. The cellular code for mammalian thermosensation J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 :5533-5541 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that DT-treated Mrgprd DTR mice developed increased ear thickness at 6 h compared to control mice following croton oil application ( Figure 2 I). Ablation of a different subset of epidermal non-peptidergic neurons in DT-treated Mrgpra3 DTR mice ( Han et al., 2013 23. Han, L. ∙ Ma, C. ∙ Liu, Q. ... A subpopulation of nociceptors specifically linked to itch Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :174-182 Crossref Scopus (435) PubMed Google Scholar ) did not affect croton oil responses, thereby demonstrating specificity for MrgprD-expressing neurons. FACS-sorted MCs isolated from the skin of DT-treated Mrgprd DTR mice showed increased expression of Mrgprb2 mRNA ( Figure 2 J). Finally, we observed that vascular extravasation of Evans blue dye following administration of compound 48/80 was exaggerated in DT-treated Mrgprd DTR , but not Mrgpra3 DTR , mice, while dermal MC number and FcεR-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis were unaffected ( Figures 2 K, S2 E, and S2F). Based on these results, we conclude that ablation of MrgprD-expressing neurons phenocopies the heightened MC responses observed in long-term LC-deficient mice.
Dermal MC activation is required for efficient host defense against intradermal (i.d.) injection S. aureus infection and can be augmented with exogenous MrgprB2 ligands ( Arifuzzaman et al., 2019 1. Arifuzzaman, M. ∙ Mobley, Y.R. ∙ Choi, H.W. ... MRGPR-mediated activation of local mast cells clears cutaneous bacterial infection and protects against reinfection Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaav0216 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine the effects of deleting MrgprD- expressing neurons or LC on S. aureus infection, we initiated a localized dermonecrotic infection by i.d. injection of 10 7 S. aureus USA300 into dorsocaudal skin of in Mrgprd DTR and LC DTA mice, respectively. WT mice developed large necrotic ulcers that slowly resolved during the observation period. Mrgprd DTR mice developed much smaller skin lesions that contained 10-fold fewer S. aureus colony-forming units (CFUs) on day 10 post-infection ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and 3D). We observed that long-term LC ablated (LC DTA ), but not short-term LC ablated (3-day DT-treated LC DTR ), mice also showed increased host defense to S. aureus that manifested as smaller S. aureus lesions and reduced S. aureus CFUs in skin on day 10 post-infection ( Figures 3 C, 3D, and S3 A). Control MC DTA mice were less able to control the S. aureus infection and developed larger necrotic lesions with increased CFUs. These data demonstrate that Mrgprd DTR and LC DTA mice, which similarly manifest increased expression of Mrgprb2 in dermal MCs, are more resistant to dermonecrotic S. aureus infection.
CHS to small-molecule haptens is a classic mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis. In this model, MCs are required for dendritic cell activation following hapten exposure, and CHS is reduced in the absence of MCs ( Dudeck et al., 2011 15. Dudeck, A. ∙ Dudeck, J. ∙ Scholten, J. ... Mast cells are key promoters of contact allergy that mediate the adjuvant effects of haptens Immunity. 2011; 34 :973-984 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reber et al., 2017 55. Reber, L.L. ∙ Sibilano, R. ∙ Starkl, P. ... Imaging protective mast cells in living mice during severe contact hypersensitivity JCI Insight. 2017; 2 :2 Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar ). We employed the CHS model in which mice are sensitized with the hapten 1-fluoro-2,4-dinotro-benzene (DNFB) on the abdomen and challenged with the same hapten 5 days later on the ear to measure of the effector response. Mrgprd DTR and long-term LC-deficient LC DTA mice, but not short-term LC-deficient 3-day DT-treated LC DTR or WT mice, developed greatly exaggerated CHS that peaked and resolved with similar kinetics ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Finally, using a mouse model of atopic dermatitis involving repeated application of MC903 that results in thymic stromal lymphoprotein (TSLP)-mediated activation of ILC2, which is independent of MCs ( Kim et al., 2013 34. Kim, B.S. ∙ Siracusa, M.C. ∙ Saenz, S.A. ... TSLP elicits IL-33-independent innate lymphoid cell responses to promote skin inflammation Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5 :170ra16 Crossref Scopus (607) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2006 37. Li, M. ∙ Hener, P. ∙ Zhang, Z. ... Topical vitamin D3 and low-calcemic analogs induce thymic stromal lymphopoietin in mouse keratinocytes and trigger an atopic dermatitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :11736-11741 Crossref Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed that inflammation was unaffected by the absence of MrgprD-expressing neurons ( Figure 3 G). Thus, Mrgprd DTR mice phenocopy mice with long-term absence of LC in four distinct inflammatory or protective immune responses that are known to require MCs: i.d. 48/80, irritant dermatitis to croton oil, allergic contact dermatitis to DNFB, and host defense against dermonecrotic S. aureus infection.
Beta-alanine (β-ala) is a MrgprD agonist that activates and enhances the excitability of MrgprD-expressing neurons ( Liu et al., 2012 40. Liu, Q. ∙ Sikand, P. ∙ Ma, C. ... Mechanisms of itch evoked by β-alanine J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :14532-14537 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rau et al., 2009 54. Rau, K.K. ∙ McIlwrath, S.L. ∙ Wang, H. ... Mrgprd enhances excitability in specific populations of cutaneous murine polymodal nociceptors J.

Identification of a G protein-coupled receptor specifically responsive to beta-alanine J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :23559-23564 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our observation that MrgprD-expressing neurons are required to suppress MC activation, we hypothesized that augmenting their activation through exogenous administration of β-ala would suppress MC activation and be accompanied by reduced expression of Mrgprb2 in MCs. To test this hypothesis, WT and DT-treated Mrgprd DTR mice were injected at distinct skin sites with β-ala for 2 days followed by intravenous (i.v.) administration of Evans blue dye. Mice were then challenged with i.d. saline or compound 48/80. Compound 48/80 induced dye extravasation in WT mice at the PBS-pretreated site, but the response was diminished at the β-ala-pretreated site ( Figures 4 A and 4B). As expected, compound 48/80 induced increased MC degranulation in DT-treated Mrgprd DTR mice, and pretreatment with β-ala had no effect. Thus, pretreatment with β-ala attenuated MC activation in WT mice, and its action required the presence of MrgprD-expressing neurons. β-ala pretreatment did not induce scratching behavior, showed no effect on FcεR-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and did not alter the number of dermal MCs ( Figures S4 A–S4C). Interestingly, suppression of MC function required administration of β-ala for at least 2 days and was not effective when co-administered with compound 48/80 challenge (data not shown).
To analyze the effect of β-ala on the relative expression of Mrgprb2 transcripts in MCs, we administered 50 mM β-ala or PBS by i.d. injection in WT mice once daily for 2 days. Consistent with our hypothesis, expression of Mrgprb2 was reduced ∼3-fold ( Figure 4 C). In addition, expression of Mrgprb2 was elevated in DT-treated Mrgprd DTR mice, and administration of β-ala did not modify the elevated transcript levels. Thus, the stimulation of MrgprD-expressing neurons with β-ala appears to reduce MrgprB2 mediated activation of MCs in part by downregulation of Mrgprb2 expression.
We next tested the capacity of β-ala to suppress MC function in several mouse models of human disease. Using the dermonecrotic S. aureus model, we observed that β-ala administration to WT mice inhibited host defense, resulting in enlarged skin lesions and increased CFUs on day 10 post-infection ( Figures 4 D, 4E, and S4 D). In addition, β-ala pretreatment prior to DNFB sensitization significantly blunted the development of CHS in WT mice but had no effect in Mrgprd DTR mice ( Figure 4 F). Finally, we tested whether β-ala could suppress inflammation in a mouse model of rosacea based on i.d. injection of LL-37, a cleavage product of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin that activates MCs likely via the MrgprB2 receptor ( Choi et al., 2019 10. Choi, J.E. ∙ Werbel, T. ∙ Wang, Z. ... Botulinum toxin blocks mast cells and prevents rosacea like inflammation J. Dermatol. Sci. 2019; 93 :58-64 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ; Muto et al., 2014 46. Muto, Y. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Vanderberghe, M. ...

Mas-related gene X2 (MrgX2) is a novel G protein-coupled receptor for the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in human mast cells: resistance to receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization J.

LL-37-induced human mast cell activation through G protein-coupled receptor MrgX2 Int. Immunopharmacol. 2017; 49 :6-12 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that pretreatment of WT mice with β-ala inhibited LL-37-mediated skin erythema and suppressed expression of the rosacea-linked biomarkers Cma1 , Klk5 , and Mmp9 ( Figures 4 G, 4H, and S4 E). Thus, β-ala agonism of MrgprD-expressing neurons in WT mice is sufficient to functionally reduce steady-state MC expression of Mrgprb2 and reduce inflammation in multiple skin disease models in which MCs are known to play a key role. These phenotypes are opposite of those observed with deletion of MrgprD-expressing neurons and LC in Mrgprd DTR and LC DTA mice, respectively, strongly suggesting a molecular pathway that reciprocally programs the pre-activation state of dermal MCs through their cross-talk with MrgprD-expressing neurons.
We next sought to determine whether the enhanced MC activity observed in LC DTA and Mrgprd DTR mice as well as its attenuation in β-ala-treated WT mice could have shared molecular underpinnings. To do so, we sought to uncover a coherent pattern of transcriptional alterations in skin of LC DTA and Mrgprd DTR mice that were reciprocally impacted by β-ala treatment in WT mice. We performed RNA-seq using mRNA isolated from whole-ear tissue of DT-treated Mrgprd DTR mice, DT-treated control Mrgprd Cre mice, and WT mice treated once daily for 2 days with 50 mM β-ala or vehicle. RNA-seq datasets from LC DTA mice (long-term LC ablation) or LC DTR mice 3 days after DT administration (short-term LC ablation) were included in the analytic pipeline ( Table S1 ). We utilized a generalizable computational approach that enables simultaneous analysis of RNA-seq datasets generated by multiple and diverse perturbations of an experimental system to uncover coherent and where possible reciprocally regulated patterns of gene expression ( Figure 5 A). This approach is dependent on normalization of gene transcript values using Z scores within a sample and then across the various samples constituting a given perturbation (P). The transformed data involving the various perturbations (P 1 − P n ) is then combined and analyzed by one-dimensional hierarchical clustering to partition clusters of genes (gene modules) that manifest similar or reciprocal dynamic patterns with respect to the various perturbations of the system. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis reveals gene modules and associated molecular pathways that may account for the shared or reciprocal phenotypic changes associated with the diverse perturbations. Application of the computational pipeline to the RNA-seq datasets from the three perturbations generated six coherent gene modules ( Figure 5 B). The M4 module displayed a dynamic that fit expectations generated by the phenotypic analyses in that it represented a group of genes whose expression was induced by long-term loss of LC and deletion of MrgprD-expressing neurons. In contrast, M4 module genes were downregulated by β-ala administration ( Figures 5 B and S5 A; Table S2 ). GO pathway enrichment analysis of M4 genes showed significant enrichment of those involved in MC activation ( Figure 5 C). We note that pairwise comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the three distinct perturbations revealed a set of MC genes that were contained within the M4 module ( Figure S5 B). To determine whether a subset of M4 module genes reflected their perturbation-induced dynamics specifically in MCs, RNA-seq analysis was performed on purified MCs isolated from DT-treated Mrgprd DTR and control Mrgprd Cre mice ( Table S1 ). Genes that were differentially expressed in MCs upon deletion of MrgprD-expressing neurons were intersected with M4 genes. A heatmap comprising these genes and their expression in MCs upon ablation of MrgprD-expressing neurons is shown in Figure 5 D. Biologically important genes are annotated and include Mrgprb2 , other Mrgprs, and proteases such as Cpa3 , Ctsg , and Tpsg1 that are components of MC secretory granules. Thus, long-term deletion of LC or elimination of MrgprD-expressing neurons programs MCs into a hyperresponsive state that involves upregulation of a gene module that encompasses Mrgprb2 as well as several proteases that function as inflammatory mediators upon MC activation and degranulation.
To determine how MrgprD-expressing neurons alter MC transcription and function, we first explored whether release of SP or CGRP from TRPV1-expressing neurons could be increased in LC DTA or Mrgprd DTR mice. qPCR of whole dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from Mrgprd DTR mice revealed the expected decrease of the genes Mrgprd , Trpa1 , and P2xr3 , known to be enriched in MrgprD-expressing neurons ( Reynders et al., 2015 57. Reynders, A. ∙ Mantilleri, A. ∙ Malapert, P. ... Transcriptional Profiling of Cutaneous MRGPRD Free Nerve Endings and C-LTMRs Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :1007-1019 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Usoskin et al., 2015 70. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (1430) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 A). The genes encoding for the neuropeptides CGRP ( Calca ) and SP ( Tac1 ), however, were unaffected in either LC DTA or Mrgprd DTR mice. We also observed equivalent release of CGRP and SP from capsaicin stimulated cultured DRG cells isolated from WT and Mrgprd DTR mice ( Figure S6 B). Thus, increased MC activation by TRPV1-expressing neurons appears unlikely to explain altered MC phenotype in LC DTA or Mrgprd DTR mice.
Glutamate is a well-described neurotransmitter that is known to be released by all cutaneous sensory afferents ( Jahr and Jessell, 1985 26. Jahr, C.E. ∙ Jessell, T.M. Synaptic transmission between dorsal root ganglion and dorsal horn neurons in culture: antagonism of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials and glutamate excitation by kynurenate J. Neurosci. 1985; 5 :2281-2289 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Schneider and Perl, 1985 60. Schneider, S.P. ∙ Perl, E.R. Selective excitation of neurons in the mammalian spinal dorsal horn by aspartate and glutamate in vitro: correlation with location and excitatory input Brain Res. 1985; 360 :339-343 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). The vesicular glutamate transporter vGlut2 ( Slc17a6 ) is required for loading glutamate into synaptic vesicles and is widely expressed by neurons in the DRG ( Liu et al., 2010 39. Liu, Y. ∙ Abdel Samad, O. ∙ Zhang, L. ... VGLUT2-dependent glutamate release from nociceptors is required to sense pain and suppress itch Neuron. 2010; 68 :543-556 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scherrer et al., 2010 59. Scherrer, G. ∙ Low, S.A. ∙ Wang, X. ... VGLUT2 expression in primary afferent neurons is essential for normal acute pain and injury-induced heat hypersensitivity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :22296-22301 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Slc17a6 (vGlut2) expression was modestly but significantly reduced in whole DRGs isolated from LC DTA mice ( Figure 6 A). Similarly, DRG cells from WT mice cultured in vitro in the presence of β-ala showed increased expression of Slc17a6 (vGlut2), which was not observed in DRG isolated from Mrgprd DTR mice ( Figure 6 B). We next examined glutamate release from cultured DRG cells. The TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) efficiently triggered glutamate release in cultured DRGs isolated from WT mice ( Figure 6 C). Notably, WT DRGs cultured in β-ala for 48 h released higher levels of glutamate in response to AITC ( Figure 6 D). In contrast, DRGs isolated from LC DTA mice released lower amounts of glutamate ( Figure 6 E). Thus, glutamate release is increased by β-ala exposure and reduced in LC DTA mice.
Finally, to determine whether glutamate release from MrgprD-expressing neurons regulates MC function, we bred Mrgprd Cre mice with Slc17a6 f/f mice to generate Mrgprd ΔvGlut2/+ mice ( Tong et al., 2007 67. Tong, Q. ∙ Ye, C. ∙ McCrimmon, R.J. ... Synaptic glutamate release by ventromedial hypothalamic neurons is part of the neurocircuitry that prevents hypoglycemia Cell Metab. 2007; 5 :383-393 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ). These mice have the loss of a single allele of Slc17a6 in MrgprD-expressing neurons and reduced glutamate release without generating potential developmental defects or compensatory effects resulting from the complete absence of Slc17a6 ( Schallier et al., 2009 58. Schallier, A. ∙ Massie, A. ∙ Loyens, E. ... vGLUT2 heterozygous mice show more susceptibility to clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol Neurochem. Int. 2009; 55 :41-44 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tupal et al., 2014 69. Tupal, S. ∙ Rieger, M.A. ∙ Ling, G.Y. ... Testing the role of preBötzinger Complex somatostatin neurons in respiratory and vocal behaviors Eur. J. Neurosci. 2014; 40 :3067-3077 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, expression of Mrgprb2 was increased ∼4-fold in unmanipulated Mrgprd ΔvGlut2/+ skin, and i.d. challenge with compound 48/80 resulted in increased Evans blue dye extravasation, consistent with increased MC activation ( Figure 6 F and 6G). Thus, glutamate released from MrgprD-expressing neurons reduced expression of Mrgprb2 in MCs and attenuated their responsiveness during homeostasis.
The glutamate family of receptors is composed of several categories of receptors, including ionotropic NMDA-, AMPA-, and kainate-type receptors as well metabotropic receptors ( Reiner and Levitz, 2018 56. Reiner, A. ∙ Levitz, J. Glutamatergic Signaling in the Central Nervous System: Ionotropic and Metabotropic Receptors in Concert Neuron. 2018; 98 :1080-1098 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ). We compared expression of glutamate receptors in our RNA-seq dataset of sorted dermal MCs isolated from control and Mrgprd DTR mice ( Table S1 ). We observed highest transcripts for Grik2 (GluR6) and Grik5 (KA2), which are both members of the kainate glutamate receptor family ( Figure 6 H). A similar expression pattern was observed in previously reported datasets of dermal and peritoneal cell-derived mast cell (PCMC)-derived MCs ( Dwyer et al., 2016 17. Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Barrett, N.A. ∙ Austen, K.F., Immunological Genome Project Consortium Expression profiling of constitutive mast cells reveals a unique identity within the immune system Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :878-887 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yoshida et al., 2019 74. Yoshida, H. ∙ Lareau, C.A. ∙ Ramirez, R.N. ..., Immunological Genome Project The cis-Regulatory Atlas of the Mouse Immune System Cell. 2019; 176 :897-912.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). KA2 is an obligate heterodimer that functions only in combination with GluR5-7 ( Kumar et al., 2011 36. Kumar, J. ∙ Schuck, P. ∙ Mayer, M.L. Structure and assembly mechanism for heteromeric kainate receptors Neuron. 2011; 71 :319-331 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, the most likely glutamate receptor in MCs is a heterodimer of KA2 and GluR6. NS102 is a selective antagonist for GluR6-containing glutamate receptor complexes ( Verdoorn et al., 1994 71. Verdoorn, T.A. ∙ Johansen, T.H. ∙ Drejer, J. ... Selective block of recombinant glur6 receptors by NS-102, a novel non-NMDA receptor antagonist Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 269 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether KA2/GluR6 is operative in MCs and whether it affects MC programming and function in vivo , we administered 50 μM NS102 i.d. into flank skin of WT and Mrgprd DTR mice twice daily for 2 days, assayed Mrgprb2 expression, and compound 48/80 responses. Pretreatment with NS102 increased expression of Mrgprb2 and extravasation of Evans blue dye following compound 48/80 challenge to levels similar to those observed in Mrgprd DTR mice ( Figures 6 I and 6J). Notably, NS102 had no effect in Mrgprd DTR mice or WT mice pretreated with β-ala, indicating that NS102 acts downstream of glutamate release.
To determine if glutamate can act directly on MCs, we utilized in vitro cultures of PCMCs. High-purity PCMCs were obtained after a 3- to 4-week culture of peritoneal cells from WT mice in interlukin-3 (IL-3) and stem cell factor ( Figure S7 A). PCMCs cultured for 48 h in the presence of NS102 showed a dose-dependent increase in expression of Mrgprb2 and increased β-hexosaminidase release 40 min after stimulation with compound 48/80 ( Figures 7 A and 7B). In contrast, PCMCs transferred into glutamate-free Tyrode’s buffer for 6 h showed a dose-dependent decrease in Mrgprb2 expression and compound 48/80-induced β-hexosaminidase release with varying concentrations of glutamate supplementation ( Figures 7 C and 7D). We did not observe cell death or MC degranulation in the presence of glutamate at 6 h, but PCMCs could not maintain viability in Tyrode’s buffer beyond 6 h ( Figures S7 B and S7C). To comprehensively analyze alterations in MC transcriptional programming in response to modulation of glutamate signaling, we performed RNA-seq with mRNA isolated from PCMCs cultured for 48 h with vehicle or NS102 and PCMCs cultured for 6 h in glutamate-free Tyrode’s buffer supplemented with vehicle or 4 mM glutamate. A large set of genes showed a reciprocal expression pattern with the opposing modulations of glutamate signaling, increasing with NS102 inhibition and diminishing with glutamate supplementation ( Figure S7 D). Importantly, when we overlapped the DEGs induced by inhibition of glutamate signaling in PCMCs with the upregulated genes in sorted dermal MCs from Mrgprd DTR mice ( Figure 5 D), we observed a very strong positive enrichment (p = 1.89 × 10 −17 ) ( Figure 7 E). Thus, inhibition of glutamate signaling, likely through the KA2/GluR6 receptor complex, programs a hyperactive MC gene expression state in vitro that strongly resembles the hyperreactive MC state caused by loss of MrgprD-expressing neurons in vivo .

Section: Discussion

Herein, we document the existence of a neuroimmune regulatory pathway in which MrgprD-expressing afferent neurons in the skin suppress MC hyperresponsiveness via glutamate-induced transcriptional reprogramming of MCs, thereby maintaining cutaneous immune homeostasis. Importantly, the survival of the MrgprD-expressing neurons is in turn dependent on their association with LC. Long-term ablation of LC resulted in loss of MrgprD-expressing free nerve endings in the epidermis, reduced neuronal release of glutamate and hyperresponsive dermal MCs. Thus, MrgprD-expressing neurons link LC in the epidermis with the state of dermal MC responsiveness. This three-way cellular cross-talk has important implications for neuronal control of MC-driven inflammation in the context of protective as well as pathogenic immune responses. Furthermore, it reveals a hitherto-unappreciated mechanism by which LC maintain cutaneous homeostasis via MrgprD-expressing neuron suppression of MCs.
It is likely that MrgprD-expressing neurons require a LC-derived growth factor and retract their nerve endings in its absence. We speculate that the loss of epidermal free nerve endings could potentially deprive MrgprD-expressing neurons of a key epidermal-derived factor (possibly β-ala or other potential MrgprD ligands) required to maintain optimal glutamate release in the dermis. Using a related LC-depletion method ( Langerin DTR mice), Doss et al. reported reduced epidermal nerve density of CGRP-expressing neurons in conjunction with reduced expression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; a GRFα2 ligand) and nerve growth factor (NGF; a GFRα3 ligand) ( Doss and Smith, 2014 14. Doss, A.L. ∙ Smith, P.G. Langerhans cells regulate cutaneous innervation density and mechanical sensitivity in mouse footpad Neurosci. Lett. 2014; 578 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since MrgprD-expressing neurons are dependent on GFRα2 ligands, we favor a model in which LC ablation either directly or indirectly reduces levels of epidermal GDNF required to maintain MrgprD-expressing epidermal nerve endings. We did not observe any reduction in CGRP-expressing neurons, possibly due to the analysis of different skin sites (i.e., flank versus footpad) or minor differences between Langerin DTR and LC DTA mice ( Kaplan et al., 2008 29. Kaplan, D.H. ∙ Kissenpfennig, A. ∙ Clausen, B.E. Insights into Langerhans cell function from Langerhans cell ablation models Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38 :2369-2376 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). MrgprD-expressing free nerve endings in the epidermis were reduced by the long-term, but not short-term, ablation of LC. Neurite retraction may be a gradual process, thereby explaining why long-term, but not short-term, ablation of LC results in MC hyperresponsiveness.
We have identified glutamate as a key neurotransmitter that is secreted by MrgprD-expressing neurons to directly modulate the transcriptional programming and functional responsiveness of MCs in a variety of inflammatory contexts. Importantly, we consistently observed dermal MC hyperreactivity using a diverse set of perturbations in which glutamate released from MrgprD-expressing neurons was either eliminated, reduced or blocked in vivo : mice lacking MrgprD-expressing neurons ( Mrgprd DTR ), long-term LC-deficient mice (LC DTA ) with reduced MrgprD-expressing epidermal free nerve endings, Mrgprd ΔvGlut2/+ mice with loss of a single allele of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2, and i.d. administration of KA2/GluR6 glutamate receptor inhibitor (NS102) in WT mice. In contrast, activation of MrgprD-expressing neurons with β-ala resulted in increased glutamate release and MC hyporesponsiveness. Notably, inhibition of glutamate sensing by cultured MCs or its restoration resulted in reciprocal programming of a module of MC genes that regulated mast cell activation and their inflammatory functions.
The module of MC genes regulated across all in vivo and in vitro perturbations includes Mrgprb2 , a member of a Mas-related family of G-protein-coupled receptors expressed primarily by MCs. MrgprB2 functions as an activating receptor for non-immunoglobulin E (non-IgE)-mediated MC degranulation in response to multiple exogenous and endogenous ligands, including the neuropeptide SP ( Galli and Tsai, 2012 19.

Mas-related gene X2 (MrgX2) is a novel G protein-coupled receptor for the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in human mast cells: resistance to receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :44739-44749 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is consistent with our findings that FcεRI activation in the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model was unaffected when MC MrgprB2 expression was altered. In contrast, in multiple in vivo models that involve MrgprB2 (e.g., irritant dermatitis, compound 48/80 administration, CHS, host defense to dermonecrotic S. aureus infection, and LL-37 induced rosacea), the extent of the inflammatory response correlated with expression of Mrgprb2 . Thus, it is likely that MrgpB2 expression levels determine, at least in part, the extent of MC degranulation in these models. In addition to Mrgprb2 , we noted altered expression of several other Mrgpr-family members, as well as genes that encode MC granule proteases and other MC effector proteins. Thus, glutamate signaling modulates a MC transcriptional program encompassing a set of MC receptors and effector proteins that may be functionally specialized for IgE-independent MC activation. We propose that it represents a distinctive MC-extrinsic mechanism that “tunes” MC responsiveness to select stimuli ( Galli et al., 2008 20. Galli, S.J. ∙ Grimbaldeston, M. ∙ Tsai, M. Immunomodulatory mast cells: negative, as well as positive, regulators of immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8 :478-486 Crossref Scopus (661) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The mechanisms by which LC promote immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive responses have been controversial for many years ( Kaplan, 2017 27. Kaplan, D.H. Ontogeny and function of murine epidermal Langerhans cells Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :1068-1075 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Much experimental effort has focused on the capacity of LC to function as antigen-presenting cells and prime effector or regulatory T cell responses. That LC are required to maintain epidermal innervation, which in turn modulates MC responsiveness, provides a new function for LC and a new perspective on this question. The observations that exaggerated CHS in LC DTA mice is phenocopied in Mrgprd DTR mice and that β-ala can suppress CHS argue that heightened MC activation in the absence of LC can account for many of the immunosuppressive functions attributed to LC. The same mechanism of heightened MC degranulation and concomitant local inflammation in the absence of LC may explain why male skin from LC DTA , but not WT, mice transplanted onto female WT mice is rejected ( Obhrai et al., 2008 47. Obhrai, J.S. ∙ Oberbarnscheidt, M. ∙ Zhang, N. ... Langerhans cells are not required for efficient skin graft rejection J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128 :1950-1955 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, maintaining tissue architecture and homeostasis is a function more closely associated with tissue macrophages than with DC. Thus, in this context, LC appear to be functioning akin to tissue macrophages with which they share a common ontogeny ( Ginhoux et al., 2006 21. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Tacke, F. ∙ Angeli, V. ... Langerhans cells arise from monocytes in vivo Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7 :265-273 Crossref Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hoeffel et al., 2012 24. Hoeffel, G. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Greter, M. ... Adult Langerhans cells derive predominantly from embryonic fetal liver monocytes with a minor contribution of yolk sac-derived macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :1167-1181 Crossref Scopus (574) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A growing body of literature argues that the MrgprB2 human ortholog, MrgprX2, likely participates in the pathogenesis of multiple human skin diseases ( Subramanian et al., 2016 65. Subramanian, H. ∙ Gupta, K. ∙ Ali, H. Roles of Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 on mast cell-mediated host defense, pseudoallergic drug reactions, and chronic inflammatory diseases J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 138 :700-710 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, our observation that β-ala agonism of MrgprD-expressing neurons suppressed MC expression of Mrgprb2 and multiple effector molecules suggests this as a potential novel therapeutic approach for human skin diseases. Although a comprehensive analysis of human peripheral sensory afferent subsets has not been reported, it is likely that MrgprD-expressing neurons project to human skin, since it has been reported that oral ingestion of β-ala as a dietary supplement can promote cutaneous tingling sensations ( Liu et al., 2012 40. Liu, Q. ∙ Sikand, P. ∙ Ma, C. ... Mechanisms of itch evoked by β-alanine J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :14532-14537 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, agonism of the KA2/GluR6 glutamate receptor on MCs could potentially also provide a similar beneficial therapeutic effect.
In summary, we have described a pathway in which epidermal nonpeptidergic MrgprD-expressing neurons actively inhibit MC hyperresponsiveness via glutamate-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, MrgprD-expressing sensory neurons have an important immunoregulatory function and maintain cutaneous immune homeostasis. We have focused exclusively on MrgprD-expressing neurons in the skin at steady state. Release of glutamate from MrgprD-expressing neurons could be modulated by physical epidermal disruption, composition of the cutaneous microbiome, or infection, thereby providing a mechanism for integration of epidermal and dermal inflammatory responses by afferent neurons. Notably, MrgprD-expressing neurons are also found in other tissues and may function similarly to those in the skin ( Bautzova et al., 2018 4. Bautzova, T. ∙ Hockley, J.R.F. ∙ Perez-Berezo, T. ... 5-oxoETE triggers nociception in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome through MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor D Sci. Signal. 2018; 11 :11 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ). These questions, as well as potential translational application of these findings, represent exciting directions for future research.
This study describes a pathway in which epidermal nonpeptidergic MrgprD-expressing neurons actively inhibit MC hyperresponsiveness via glutamate-induced transcriptional reprogramming under steady-state conditions. Additional work will be required to determine whether this system can alter MC reactivity during perturbations such as infection, inflammation, or wound healing. We also do not know how the absence of LC results in reduced glutamine release from MrgprD-expressing neurons. We have speculated this may result from reduced access to epidermal-derived β-ala in LC-deficient mice, but there are several other possibilities that could potentially explain this phenomenon. In addition, we have identified KA2 and GluR6 as likely glutamate receptors on MCs by expression of mRNA transcripts. Expression of these proteins by MCs and whether they signal as homo- or heterodimers have not been determined. Finally, agonism of MrgprD or KA2/GluR6 represents an attractive therapeutic approach to suppress MC responses in disease states. Testing these approaches in preclinical disease models and patients remains unexplored.

Mrgprd cre and Mrgpra cre mice were crossed with ROSA26iDTR mice to obtain Mrgprd DTR and Mrgpra3 DTR mice, respectively. We crossed LC DTA mice with MC DTA mice to obtain LC DTA xMC DTA mice. We generated Mrgprd TdT mice with LC DTA mice to obtain Mrgprd TdT xLC DTA mice. Mrgprd cre mice were bred with vGlut2 flox mice to obtain Mrgprd ΔvGlut2/+ mice. Experiments were performed on independent cohorts of male and female mice between the ages of 6-10 weeks. All mice were maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions and all animal experiments were approved by University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
To deplete Langerhans cells (LC), LC DTR mice were given 1 μg DT (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) in 100 μl PBS by intraperitoneal injection for short-term depletion of LC. For long-term depletion, LC DTR mice were given 100 ng DT after initial injection every 10 days. For denervation of MrgprD or MrgprA3 neurons, DT treatment was modified as previously described ( Han et al., 2013 23. Han, L. ∙ Ma, C. ∙ Liu, Q. ...

Four-week old Mrgprd DTR or Mrgpra3 DTR mice were given 300 ng DT twice a week for 3-4 weeks. Littermate control mice were treated on the same schedule with intraperitoneal injections of 100 μl PBS.
For irritant dermatitis model, mice were directly challenged with 20 μl to both sides of one ear with 1% croton oil in acetone: olive oil (4:1). Ears were measured with a micrometer (Mitutoyo) at the respective time points before and after challenge and data are expressed as the ear size at the respective time points minus the baseline thickness. The whole ear was fixed in 4% PFA and processed for H&E and toluidine blue staining as described ( Cohen et al., 2019 11. Cohen, J.A. ∙ Edwards, T.N. ∙ Liu, A.W. ...

For the contact hypersensitivity model, mice were sensitized on day 0 by epicutaneous application of 25 μl of 0.25% DNFB (1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, Sigma) in acetone: olive oil (4:1) or vehicle alone onto dry shaven abdominal skin. On day 5, baseline ear thickness was measured with a micrometer followed by challenge with 10 μl of 0.2% DNFB to both sides of one ear. Ear thickness was measured at the respective time points.
For epidermal sheets, dorsal and ventral halves of the ear were separated and pressed epidermis side down onto double sided adhesive (3M, St. Paul MN). Slides were incubated in 10 mM EDTA in PBS for 45 min, allowing physical removal of the dermis, before being washed twice in PBS and fixed 60 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) before immunolabeling ( Kaplan et al., 2005 28.

Epidermal langerhans cell-deficient mice develop enhanced contact hypersensitivity Immunity. 2005; 23 :611-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). For sectioned tissue, ear or flank skin was embedded in O.C.T compound at −80°C. The frozen tissue was cut at 8 μM and mounted onto Superfrost plus slides. Slides were fixed in 4% PFA before immunolabeling. Tissues were mounted with Vecta shield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Primary antibodies used included: goat anti-CGRP (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), goat anti-GFRα2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MI), goat anti-GFRα3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MI), rabbit anti-PGP9.5 (Ultraclone Ltd., Yarmouth, Isle of Wight). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Alexa568-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluting buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% Tween20, 0.1% NaN3 in PBS). For whole mount tissue, ears were cut into small pieces and fixed in 4% PFA for 2-3 hours then washed in 0.2% PBST for 5-7 hours. Tissue was labeled with FITC conjugated Avidin (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) and 4’,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) in a solution containing 20% DMSO, and 5% goat serum for 3-5 days at room temperature. After washing, tissues were mounted with Vecta shield without DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured using an Olympus fluorescent microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and Olympus FluoView confocal microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Total mRNA from whole ears, sorted dermal mast cells or cultured peritoneal-derived mast cells were prepared using the QIAGEN RNeasy Kit (Hilden, Germany). The mRNA libraries were generated using Illumina Truseq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit, followed by 75bp single indexed sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq500 to obtain 40-50 million reads per sample. Reads were mapped to the mm9 mouse genome with STAR aligner ( Dobin et al., 2013 13. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27072) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene expression values (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads; FPKM) were calculated using Cufflinks ( Dobin et al., 2013 13. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ...

Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (11852) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differentially expressed genes were determined using cuffdiff function. FPKM matrix of log2 transformed values were imported in R (R version 3.5.2)( R Development Core Team, 2018 53. R Development Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2018 https://www.R-project.org Google Scholar ) to enable the analysis of gene modules that manifested coherent dynamics across the three perturbations. For this analysis, all genes with a non-zero value in at least one replicate in a given experiment were selected, and then each sample was z-scored for all such expression values. In a second step, the gene values were z-scored across all samples representing a given perturbation. The resulting expression matrices spanning the 3 perturbations were then merged. Next genes were hierarchically clustered using the Ward’s method, and the hierarchical tree was cut to generate 6 clusters. The mean expression value for all genes within a cluster was used to generate a mean cluster profile. These mean cluster values were used to partition genes in the original matrix into modules based on their maximum correlation values. The resulting six modules (M1-M6) were tested for conditional gene ontology enrichment using the GOstats package ( Falcon and Gentleman, 2007 18. Falcon, S. ∙ Gentleman, R. Using GOstats to test gene lists for GO term association Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :257-258 Crossref Scopus (1502) PubMed Google Scholar ) as described previously( Chaudhri et al., 2020 8.

Heatmaps were generated using package made4( Culhane et al., 2005 12. Culhane, A.C. ∙ Thioulouse, J. ∙ Perrière, G. ... MADE4: an R package for multivariate analysis of gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :2789-2790 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using The Broad Institute pipeline ( https://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea ).
Single cell suspensions were obtained as previously described ( Kashem et al., 2015 31. Kashem, S.W. ∙ Riedl, M.S. ∙ Yao, C. ... Nociceptive Sensory Fibers Drive Interleukin-23 Production from CD301b+ Dermal Dendritic Cells and Drive Protective Cutaneous Immunity Immunity. 2015; 43 :515-526 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). The skin was minced finely with scissors and resuspended in RPMI1640 (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) with 2.5 mg/mL collagenase XI (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.25 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mg/mL DNase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01 M HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10% FBS followed by incubation in a shaking incubator for 1 h at 37°C at 250 rpm. The resulting cells were filtered through a 40 mm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). After doublet and live/dead (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) exclusion, mast cells (MC) were gated as follows: CD45+ CD11b- CD11c- CD19- F4/80- CD4- CD8- FcεRI+ CD117+. Samples were analyzed on LSRFortessa flow cytometers (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies used include CD117 (ACK2), CD107a (1D4B) and CD19 (1D3) (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and FcεRIα (Mar-1), CD45.2 (104), CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), CD4(RM4-5), CD8a (53-6.7), I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2), CD3ε (17A2) and F4/80 (BM8) (Biolegend, San Diego, CA). For extracellular staining, antibodies were diluted in staining media (3% Calf Serum, 5mM EDTA, 0.04% Azide).
Peritoneal cells from C57BL/6 female mice were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Sodium pyruvate (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), 1 x Non-essential amino acids (Corning), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), 4 mM L-glutamine (Corning), and 25 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-3 and 15 ng/ml stem cell factor (Peprotech). The cells were maintained at a concentration of 0.5-1x10 6 cells/ml with weekly changes of the medium. After 3-week culturing, the cell population purity was analyzed by flow cytometry and further used for experiment. The cells were then cultured in regular RPMI1640 medium with or without NS102, or washed and cultured in glutamate-free Tyrode’s buffer (Sigma) adding different concentration of glutamate. The cells were then harvested and stimulated with 10 μg/ml compound 48/80 for 40 min at 37°C and β-hexosaminidase (β-hex) released into the supernatant was detected as previously described ( Malbec et al., 2007 41. Malbec, O. ∙ Roget, K. ∙ Schiffer, C. ... Peritoneal cell-derived mast cells: an in vitro model of mature serosal-type mouse mast cells J. Immunol. 2007; 178 :6465-6475 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). The OD was read at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. The percentage of β-hex release was calculated by the following formula: (supernatant β-hex) x100/(lysate β-hex + supernatant β-hex). To detect PCMC degranulation by flow cytometry, after doublet and live/dead exclusion, degranulated PCMC were gated as follows: CD45+ FcεRI+ CD117+ CD107a+ Avidin+.
Lumbar and thoracic DRGs were pooled, dissociated and cultured for qPCR, glutamate, substance P and CGRP release assays. Dissection and culture were performed as previously described ( Malin et al., 2007 42. Malin, S.A. ∙ Davis, B.M. ∙ Molliver, D.C. Production of dissociated sensory neuron cultures and considerations for their use in studying neuronal function and plasticity Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :152-160 Crossref Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, following euthanasia and perfusion with ice cold Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ -free HBSS, isolated ganglia were placed into cold HBSS. DRGs were transferred to 3mL of filter-sterilized 60U papain/ 1mg L-cys/ HBSS buffered with NaHCO 3 at 37°C for 10 minutes, then to filter sterilized collagenase II (4 mg/mL)/dispase II (4.67 mg/mL) in HBSS for 20 minutes at 37°C. Enzymes were neutralized in Advanced DMEM/F12 media (Thermo Fisher, Pittsburgh PA) with 10% FBS (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY). Neurons were dissociated in media with trituration through a series of fire-polished glass pipettes. Cells were plated in Advanced DMEM/F12 (as above) supplemented with 10 ng/mL NGF 2.5S (ThermoFisher, Pittsburgh, PA) in 24 well plates for all assays. Cells for neurotransmitter release assays were plated at the following concentrations: CGRP: 20,000 cells/well, Substance P: 60,000 cells/ well, glutamate: 40,000 cells/well. For RNA extractions, dissociated neurons from a single mouse were split 1:1 (approximately 60k neurons/ well) and plated in media with or without 2mM β-alanine. Media was refreshed the next morning and cells harvested after 24 hours in culture. Cultured cells were plated 1-2x overnight prior to stimulation for neurotransmitter release assays.
Neuropeptide release assays were performed as previously described with slight modifications ( Kashem et al., 2015 31. Kashem, S.W. ∙ Riedl, M.S. ∙ Yao, C. ... Nociceptive Sensory Fibers Drive Interleukin-23 Production from CD301b+ Dermal Dendritic Cells and Drive Protective Cutaneous Immunity Immunity. 2015; 43 :515-526 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). After about 40 hours in culture, neurons were washed with 1xHBSS (with Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ - GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) for 5 minutes and then incubated in 1xHBSS for 10 minutes to measure basal release. Cells were stimulated with 100nM Capsaicin in 1xHBSS for 10 minutes and the supernatant collected prior to lysing the cells in lysis buffer (20mM Tris, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5% Tx). CGRP and Substance P in the supernatant was measured using the CGRP EIA kit and Substance P Elisa Kit respectively (both: Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as per the manufacturer’s instructions using Gen5 1.10 software and a BioTek Epoch microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT).
For glutamate release neurons were plated in media (as above) with or without 2 mM β-alanine. Media was refreshed daily. Two hours prior to stimulation fresh media was supplemented with 100 μM DL- threo -β-Benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA, Tocris, Minneapolis, MN), a blocker of excitatory amino acid transporters. To remove glutamate-containing culture media, neuron cultures were washed 3x with 1xHBSS (with Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ ) for 5 minutes. Cultures were incubated in 1xHBSS (controls) or stimulated with 100 μM Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 1xHBSS for 10 minutes, and the supernatant collected prior to lysing the cells. The concentration of glutamate released by stimulation and the total lysed content of glutamate in neuron cultures was determined using the glutamate glo assay (Promega, Madison WI) and measured with SOFTmax Pro for Lmax 1.1 software and a Lmax Microplate Luminometer or SpectraMax iD5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA).
To extract whole tissue RNA, ears or flank skins were homogenized using a homogenizer (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) and processed using the QIAGEN RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To extract mRNA from sorted skin mast cells (MC) or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures, MC were directly sorted into lysis buffer and DRG cultures were collected and processed using the QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Micro Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Whole L1-L5 DRGs were dissociated using Rino Pink Lysis tubes and Bullet Blender (Next Advance, Troy, NY) then processed using the QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA to cDNA conversion was performed using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was analyzed using TaqMan Gene Expression assays. CT values are normalized to either Gapdh/Hprt expression and are shown as relative fold change (2 -ΔΔCt ).
Evans blue extravasations were carried out as previously described ( Klemm et al., 2006 35. Klemm, S. ∙ Gutermuth, J. ∙ Hültner, L. ... The Bcl10-Malt1 complex segregates Fc epsilon RI-mediated nuclear factor kappa B activation and cytokine production from mast cell degranulation J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203 :337-347 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ; McNeil et al., 2015 43. McNeil, B.D. ∙ Pundir, P. ∙ Meeker, S. ... Identification of a mast-cell-specific receptor crucial for pseudo-allergic drug reactions Nature. 2015; 519 :237-241 Crossref Scopus (922) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were shaved on the flank and chemically depilated with Nair hair remover (Church & Dwight, Princeton, NJ). The shaved mice were allowed to rest for two days and then anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100/20 mg/kg body weight). Fifteen minutes after induction of anesthesia, mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 50 μl of 12.5 mg/ml Evans blue (Sigma) in sterile saline. Five minutes later, 10 μg/ml compound 48/80 or vehicle was i.d. injected into flank (20 μl). Twenty minutes later, the photos were taken and tissues were collected. For croton oil-mediated Evans blue extravasation, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and i.v. injected with Evans blue, followed by painting 20 μL 10% croton oil on the shaved flank skin, tissues were harvest after thirty minutes. For IgE mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, mice ear skin was sensitized with i.d. injection of anti- dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) IgE (20 ng/20 μl) for 24 h. A mixture of 100 μg DNP-HSA and Evans blue was i.v. injected and thirty minutes later, the ears were collected to measure pigmentation. Tissues were weighed and Evans blue was extracted by incubation in formamide overnight at 37°C, and the OD was read at 650 nm using a spectrophotometer. For studies using beta-alanine (β-ala) or NS102, mice were i.d. injected with 50 mM β-ala (once daily), 50 μM NS102 (twice daily) or vehicle on the flank for two consecutive days and then challenged with the indicated reagents on the same area.
Mice were anesthetized and shaved on the flank as above. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain USA300 was grown in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) media and thoroughly washed in sterile PBS. In a volume of 20 μl, 10 7 S. aureus was i.d. injected into the flank. To evaluate bacterial burden, skin was harvested 10 days post-infection, homogenized and diluted onto TSB plates supplemented with ampicillin, and incubated at 37°C for 24-48 hours for quantification of colony forming units. For studies using β-ala, 50 mM β-ala was i.d. injected in shaved flank daily for two days before infection and injected daily for 9 consecutive days post-infection.
MC903 treatment was performed as previously described ( Kim et al., 2013 34. Kim, B.S. ∙ Siracusa, M.C. ∙ Saenz, S.A. ... TSLP elicits IL-33-independent innate lymphoid cell responses to promote skin inflammation Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5 :170ra16 Crossref Scopus (607) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were treated once daily with topical application of 2 nmol of MC903 (calcipotriol, Tocris Bioscience) in 20 μl of ethanol (vehicle) on both ears. Ears were measured with a micrometer (Mitutoyo) at the respective time points before and after challenge and data are expressed as the ear size at the respective time points minus the baseline thickness.
The skin rosacea model was performed as previously described ( Choi et al., 2019 10. Choi, J.E. ∙ Werbel, T. ∙ Wang, Z. ... Botulinum toxin blocks mast cells and prevents rosacea like inflammation J. Dermatol. Sci. 2019; 93 :58-64 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, shaved skin was intradermally injected with 50 μl 320 mM cathelicidin LL-37 (AnaSpec Inc, Fremont, CA) twice a day for 2 days. PBS or β-ala (50 mM) was injected with LL-37 once daily. The area of cutaneous erythema was calculated. Skin biopsies were taken after 72 h of observation, and tissues were immersed immediately into RNAlater stabilization reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and stored at −80 °C.
Quantification of Intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IEFN) with antibodies against Pgp9.5, GFRα2, GFRα3 and CGRP were determined from cross sections of two distinct areas of single tissue sections and pooled from 4-5 mice. Scoring was performed blind. Data is represented as the counted number of nerve fibers which cross the basement membrane.
Quantification of mast cells (MC) with avidin or toluidine blue staining was determined from cross sections of 2-3 distinct areas from a single tissue section and areas pooled from 3-4 mice. ImageJ imaging software was used to quantify MC number. Data is represented as the counted MC number or percentage of degranulated MC.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Data is represented as mean ± standard error (SEM). Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA was used to compare corresponding groups as indicated.
