Title: An Immunologic Mode of Multigenerational Transmission Governs a Gut Treg Setpoint


Abstract: Summary

At the species level, immunity depends on the selection and transmission of protective components of the immune system. A microbe-induced population of RORγ-expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) is essential in controlling gut inflammation. We uncovered a non-genetic, non-epigenetic, non-microbial mode of transmission of their homeostatic setpoint. RORγ + Treg proportions varied between inbred mouse strains, a trait transmitted by the mother during a tight age window after birth but stable for life, resistant to many microbial or cellular perturbations, then further transferred by females for multiple generations. RORγ + Treg proportions negatively correlated with IgA production and coating of gut commensals, traits also subject to maternal transmission, in an immunoglobulin- and RORγ + Treg-dependent manner. We propose a model based on a double-negative feedback loop, vertically transmitted via the entero-mammary axis. This immunologic mode of multi-generational transmission may provide adaptability and modulate the genetic tuning of gut immune responses and inflammatory disease susceptibility.

Section: Introduction

The evolution of immunological traits is essential for the fitness of any species. Genome-wide association studies have identified several human genetic variants positively selected for pathogen resistance, but these pathogen-selected genetic variants are a double-edged sword: while buffering populations against widespread epidemics, they increase the risk of autoimmune diseases ( Barreiro and Quintana-Murci, 2010 6. Barreiro, L.B. ∙ Quintana-Murci, L. From evolutionary genetics to human immunology: how selection shapes host defence genes Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11 :17-30 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, variations in the HLA region that confer protection from or bestow slower progression to tuberculosis and HIV are associated with increased development of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease ( Dendrou et al., 2018 19. Dendrou, C.A. ∙ Petersen, J. ∙ Rossjohn, J. ... HLA variation and disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 :325-339 Crossref Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ). Polymorphisms in genes encoding several cytokines, their receptors, or innate recognition receptors that are crucial for host defense have also been associated with increased autoimmune disease risk ( Netea et al., 2012 48. Netea, M.G. ∙ Wijmenga, C. ∙ O’Neill, L.A. Genetic variation in Toll-like receptors and disease susceptibility Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :535-542 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). These polymorphisms are retained in the gene pool, increasing genetic diversity and the overall fitness of a population by balancing selection ( Hedrick, 2007 31. Hedrick, P.W. Balancing selection Curr. Biol. 2007; 17 :R230-R231 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such variants are widespread in populations, but only a subset of these carriers goes on to develop autoimmune diseases and actually account for only a minor portion of determinism ( Ye et al., 2014; Brodin et al., 2015 10. Brodin, P. ∙ Jojic, V. ∙ Gao, T. ... Variation in the human immune system is largely driven by non-heritable influences Cell. 2015; 160 :37-47 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar 73.

Intersection of population variation and autoimmunity genetics in human T cell activation Science. 2014; 345 :1254665 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, identifying the contributions of non-genetic factors is crucial to understand the mechanisms of autoimmune diseases.
While heritability is associated with the genetic make-up of an individual, several phenotypic changes or non-genetic factors are also inherited. These include changes in epigenetic states, where DNA or chromatin modifications acquired in response to environmental cues are passed on from one generation to the other ( Allis and Jenuwein, 2016 4. Allis, C.D. ∙ Jenuwein, T. The molecular hallmarks of epigenetic control Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :487-500 Crossref Scopus (1732) PubMed Google Scholar ). Parental nutrition states, microbiota composition, metabolites, and behavioral traits are also thought to influence phenotypes and disease susceptibility in offspring ( Heard and Martienssen, 2014 30. Heard, E. ∙ Martienssen, R.A. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: myths and mechanisms Cell. 2014; 157 :95-109 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1218) PubMed Google Scholar ). But it is unclear to what extent these factors affect the evolution of immunological traits.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express the transcription factor Foxp3 are a unique subset of CD4+ T cells that suppress unwanted innate and adaptive immune responses. Tregs are fundamental in promoting tolerance to harmless antigens, the breakdown of which is considered central to the origin of autoimmune diseases. Tregs are also key players in host-pathogen immunity and tissue healing post infection and inflammation ( Schiering et al., 2014 57. Schiering, C. ∙ Krausgruber, T. ∙ Chomka, A. ... The alarmin IL-33 promotes regulatory T-cell function in the intestine Nature. 2014; 513 :564-568 Crossref Scopus (774) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two distinct subpopulations of intestinal Foxp3 + Tregs are distinguished by their expression of the transcription factors Helios or RORγ. RORγ+ Tregs constitute the major subset of colonic Tregs and differentiate locally in response to bacterial antigens from 15–20 days of age onward ( Sefik et al., 2015; Ohnmacht et al., 2015 50.

Individual microbes, even members of the same bacterial genus, vary widely in the proportions of RORγ+ Tregs they induce ( Sefik et al., 2015 58. Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Oh, S. ...

Mice deficient in RORγ+ Tregs display microbial dysbiosis and increased inflammatory Th17 cells and are more susceptible to colitis in different models ( Sefik et al., 2015; Ohnmacht et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018; Al Nabhani et al., 2019; Neumann et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2017 3.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor preferentially marks and promotes gut regulatory T cells Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :2277-2290 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microbe-specific development of RORγ+ Tregs around weaning is critical to dampen susceptibility to colitis and colorectal cancer ( Al Nabhani et al., 2019 3. Al Nabhani, Z. ∙ Dulauroy, S. ∙ Marques, R. ... A weaning reaction to microbiota is required for resistance to immunopathologies in the adult Immunity. 2019; 50 :1276-1288.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). Patients with food allergies have fewer RORγ+ Tregs, and commensal-bacteria-mediated protection from food allergies is dependent on RORγ+ Tregs ( Abdel-Gadir et al., 2019 1. Abdel-Gadir, A. ∙ Stephen-Victor, E. ∙ Gerber, G.K. ... Microbiota therapy acts via a regulatory T cell MyD88/RORγt pathway to suppress food allergy Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1164-1174 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Increasing proportions of RORγ+ Tregs could be beneficial in preventing inflammation, but there seems to be a homeostatic control of the levels of RORγ+ Tregs in mice, where manipulating germ-free (GF) or specific-pathogen-free mice (SPF) with high inducers of RORγ+ Tregs does not push its levels beyond a pre-established ceiling ( Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017 25. Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Kua, L. ... Mining the human gut microbiota for immunomodulatory organisms Cell. 2017; 168 :928-943.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, the mechanisms that regulate the homeostatic balance between Helios+ and RORγ+ Tregs are largely unknown.
Here, in exploring the homeostatic control of RORγ+ Treg levels in inbred mouse strains, we uncovered a mammalian example of non-genetic inheritance of an immunological trait through multiple generations. We report a novel mode of transmission of maternal factors via the entero-mammary axis that influences colonic Treg differentiation and function and sets the immunoregulatory tone in the intestine through generations.

Section: Results

Variation between inbred strains has been a useful handle to approach cell function. To better understand RORγ+ Treg differentiation and function, we analyzed colonic Tregs in several inbred strains of mice. On the B6 background, RORγ+ Tregs constituted a substantial proportion (40%–60%) of colonic Tregs, per Sefik et al. (2015) 58. Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Oh, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar and Ohnmacht et al. (2015) 50. Ohnmacht, C. ∙ Park, J.H. ∙ Cording, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. The microbiota regulates type 2 immunity through RORγ + T cells Science. 2015; 349 :989-993 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar , but lower frequencies were observed in BALB/c and CBA/J mice with a compensatory increase in Helios+ Tregs ( Figure 1 A). RORγ+ Tregs express high levels of c-Maf, which is important for their differentiation and stability ( Xu et al., 2018; Neumann et al., 2019 49. Neumann, C. ∙ Blume, J. ∙ Roy, U. ... c-Maf-dependent T reg cell control of intestinal T H 17 cells and IgA establishes host-microbiota homeostasis Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :471-481 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genetic difference also applied to c-Maf+ colonic Treg cells ( Figure S1 A). The difference between B6 and BALB/c was reproducible with mice from different vendors ( Figure S1 B), suggesting a stable genetic trait rather than environmental variables. To verify this point, we monocolonized GF B6 and BALB/c mice with Clostridium ramosum or Bacteroides thetaiotamicron , microbes that induce high RORγ+ Treg frequencies ( Sefik et al., 2015 58. Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Oh, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ). While RORγ+ Tregs were induced by these microbes (but not by Peptostreptococcus magnus , a control) in both GF strains, the inter-strain differences remained strong ( Figure 1 B), confirming that a non-microbial element controlled inter-strain variance in RORγ+ Tregs.
To map the transmission of this trait, we intercrossed RORγ+ Treg-high and RORγ+ Treg-low strains, yielding B6 × BALB/c F1 mice. Oddly, colonic RORγ+ Tregs in adult F1s followed a bimodal distribution, which we realized tracked with the mother’s genotype: high RORγ+ Treg frequencies in F1 mice born to a B6 dam, low if to a BALB/c dam ( Figure 1 C; Table S1 ). This partition was found in 86 offspring of either sex from 14 independent breeding pairs (p < 1.11 × 10 −33 ), establishing that the RORγ+ Treg trait was maternally transmitted. The proportions of Helios+ Treg changed in balance ( Figure S1 C), but the overall proportions of FoxP3+ Tregs were unaffected by maternal type ( Figure S1 D). This maternal dominance was visible even though fathers were routinely left in the breeding cages. Maternal transmission was also observed in high × low intercrosses between three other strain combinations ( Figures S1 E–S1G), showing that the phenomenon was not a peculiarity of the B6 or BALB/c strains, but a general one. When both B6 and BALB/c mothers were co-housed in a cage with all of their progeny, the pups acquired high RORγ+ Treg frequencies, indicating that the high RORγ+ Treg phenotype prevailed, although BALB/c offspring never quite reached the levels seen in co-fed B6 offspring ( Figure S1 H). Once established, the maternally transmitted difference remained long-term in F1 mice ( Figures 1 D and S1 E–S1G).
To determine whether the maternally derived trait could be further transmitted, we bred and analyzed F2 mice by intercrossing F1 females and males. Remarkably, the progeny of the F1 crosses again mirrored the RORγ+ Treg phenotype of their mothers—and thus grandmothers, irrespective of their father’s origin ( Figure 1 E). Furthermore, the maternally transmitted trait was carried through several generations of backcross against males of the opposite parental genotype ( Figure 1 F). There was a trend toward reversion to the genetic type after a few generations (p < 10 −7 ), likely reflecting a gradual transition of the non-genetic maternal influence combined with a genetic shift. Thus, inter-strain variance in colonic RORγ+ Treg frequency was determined via matrilineal transmission, in an unusual gene × environment interaction where mothers provided both the genes and the environment.
These results raised the question of the identity of the maternal factor, epigenetic or other, responsible for the transmission. Colonic RORγ+ Tregs are absent during the first two weeks after birth and appear only between 15 and 20 days of age. Their appearance coincides with profound changes in the microbiota associated with weaning and the transition to solid food ( Al Nabhani et al., 2019 3. Al Nabhani, Z. ∙ Dulauroy, S. ∙ Marques, R. ... A weaning reaction to microbiota is required for resistance to immunopathologies in the adult Immunity. 2019; 50 :1276-1288.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ), but also results from an intrinsic change in the T cell pool from which colonic Tregs derive ( Pratama et al., 2020 54. Pratama, A. ∙ Schnell, A. ∙ Mathis, D. ... Developmental and cellular age direct conversion of CD4 + T cells into RORγ + or Helios + colon Treg cells J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20190428 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). To define the developmental stage at which RORγ+ Treg proportions were maternally transmitted, we cross-fostered B6 and BALB/c pups at birth (here, and in all other experiments in this paper, colonic Tregs were profiled at 6 weeks of age, unless stated otherwise). The mice showed RORγ+ Treg proportions similar to that of their foster mothers than to their birth mothers ( Figure 2 A). This observation excluded the possibility that matrilineal transmission resulted from epigenomic imprinting, mitochondrial DNA, or immunological modifications imparted during gestation ( Gomez de Agüero et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017; Sharon et al., 2019 26.

Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Promote Behavioral Symptoms in Mice Cell. 2019; 177 :1600-1618.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mice cross-fostered onto the opposite genotype did not quite reach the setpoints of purebred mice, indicating a complex gene × environment effect. We quantitated the relative contributions of components transmitted by the foster mother versus the genetic component by fitting a linear model to these data. The foster mother’s genotype contributed 60.7% of the variance (p < 10 −7 ) versus 27.3% of variance for the pup’s genetic component (p < 10 −6 ). As for maternal transmission in the F1 context, the transmitted trait was stable and could be further transmitted by females to their own progeny, even when crossed with males of their own genotype ( Figures 2 B and S2 A), producing offspring with pure B6 genomes but with low colonic RORγ+ Treg proportions similar to those of a BALB/c mouse (and vice versa), although not quite reaching the parental level, again indicating a compound maternal plus genetic determinism.
Experiments in which we delayed the age of cross-fostering showed that the time window for maternal transmission of the RORγ+ Treg trait was very narrow. If fostered by BALB/c mothers, B6 pups could no longer acquire the low phenotype after 3 days of age, implying that their birth mother had marked them during those first 3 days. For BALB/c pups, the high phenotype could be acquired from B6 foster mothers up to days 3–7, but not later ( Figure 2 C). Thus, maternal exposure and feeding during the first few days of life set the tone for RORγ+ Treg frequencies in adults. This time window is distinctly earlier than the appearance of RORγ+ Tregs, microbiota changes at weaning, and accompanying perturbations ( Al Nabhani et al., 2019 3. Al Nabhani, Z. ∙ Dulauroy, S. ∙ Marques, R. ... A weaning reaction to microbiota is required for resistance to immunopathologies in the adult Immunity. 2019; 50 :1276-1288.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Several lines of evidence demonstrate that RORγ+ Tregs have non-redundant roles in controlling various facets of immunologic activity in the gut, but it was important to establish the functional relevance of their maternally controlled variance. We thus studied a model of intestinal infection involving the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , infecting adult B6 mice that had been cross-fostered by either B6 or BALB/c mothers. Compared with mice fostered by B6 mothers, those fostered by BALB/c mothers had less severe colitis ( Figure 3 A), with lower bacterial burdens in the gut ( Figure 3 B) and decreased bacterial translocation to extra-intestinal sites ( Figure 3 C). Conversely, they showed an increase in interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing colonic T cells ( Figure 3 D), known to be protective against C. rodentium infection ( Collins et al., 2014 16. Collins, J.W. ∙ Keeney, K.M. ∙ Crepin, V.F. ... Citrobacter rodentium: infection, inflammation and the microbiota Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12 :612-623 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, in these genetically identical mice, maternally determined high levels of RORγ+ Tregs correlated with dampened anti-bacterial inflammatory responses. Although parallel causality cannot be ruled out, the data are compatible with the notion that maternally determined variations in RORγ+ Tregs frequencies can directly impact infection outcome.
Because RORγ+ Tregs appear 2 weeks after the narrow postnatal window of maternal transmission, the maternal effect thus determined the homeostatic setpoint of colonic RORγ+ Tregs for the mouse’s future rather than immediately inducing the cells. Plausible hypotheses for how the setpoint was imprinted by the mothers are that it could be controlled by the Treg pool, by the microbiota, or by adaptations in the local microenvironment (stroma, immune cells). We tested these hypotheses by perturbing each element. First, we cross-fostered neonates from the Foxp3 DTR lineage ablation line (B6 background) by either B6 or BALB/c females. Fostering on lactating B6 and BALB/c females led to high and low RORγ+ Tregs as expected ( Figure 3 E). Most Tregs disappeared from the colon after transient diphtheria toxin (DT) treatment (<3% remaining). When Tregs recovered after 4 weeks, RORγ+ Tregs also returned to their preset proportions ( Figures 3 E and S2 B). Thus, the maternally inherited Treg trait survived transient Treg ablation, suggesting that it was not autonomous to the mature Treg pool itself, but present in their precursors or colonic environment.
Second, to test whether changing the microbial niche could alter the RORγ+ Treg phenotype, we treated adult mice, which had been cross-fostered at birth, with a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics (VMNA) to clear intestinal microbes and reduce RORγ+ Tregs ( Sefik et al., 2015; Ohnmacht et al., 2015 50. Ohnmacht, C. ∙ Park, J.H. ∙ Cording, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. The microbiota regulates type 2 immunity through RORγ + T cells Science. 2015; 349 :989-993 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Oh, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 F). Again, after 4 weeks of recovery, RORγ+ Tregs returned to their original setpoint. Thus, the maternally transmitted trait seemed to resist a profound shuffling of the microbiota.
Third, we asked whether perturbations of the intestinal environment could affect the phenotype, using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), which induces epithelial damage and strong colonic inflammation. Here, treatment did affect RORγ+ Treg proportions, which became high regardless of the mother, in both cross-fostered ( Figures 3 G and S2 C) and F1 mice ( Figure 3 H). Importantly, this newly acquired Treg setpoint was stable and transmissible: offspring of DSS-treated F1 mice had significantly higher proportions of RORγ+ Tregs than offspring of untreated mice ( Figure 3 I). These results suggest that the RORγ+ Treg phenotype could be imprinted in neonates and maintained thereafter, in spite of complete Treg or microbiota resetting, but that major damage to the intestinal wall and resulting inflammation can reset the setpoint, for the animal and its descendants.
The central issue to address was what the mothers were actually transmitting during this narrow postnatal window that set the tone for colonic Tregs. B6 and BALB/c strains have different metabolic parameters, most markedly evidenced by body weights that were influenced by the mothers of F1 mice. However, body weights were clearly unrelated to the difference in RORγ+ Treg proportions ( Figure S3 A; 0.9% of variance and p = 0.18, versus 95.9% of variance and p < 10 −7 for maternal genotype in a linear model), nor were litter size–which affect how much nutrition each pup receives ( Figure S3 B).
Vertical transmission of microbes from mothers to offspring has been well documented ( Moon et al., 2015; Ferretti et al., 2018; Yassour et al., 2018; McDonald and McCoy, 2019 21.

Strain-Level Analysis of Mother-to-Child Bacterial Transmission during the First Few Months of Life Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :146-154.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ), and, although the points mentioned above argued against a mere transmission of microbiota, we revisited this possibility. One plausible scenario was the milk-borne transmission of endogenous retroviruses, in particular of the MMTV family, whose superantigens induce clonal deletion of T cells and affect their responsiveness ( Marrack et al., 1991; Acha-Orbea and MacDonald, 1995 2. Acha-Orbea, H. ∙ MacDonald, H.R. Superantigens of mouse mammary tumor virus Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13 :459-486 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar 44. Marrack, P. ∙ Kushnir, E. ∙ Kappler, J. A maternally inherited superantigen encoded by a mammary tumour virus Nature. 1991; 349 :524-526 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ). T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ profiling of spleen and colon T cells showed the expected differences between B6 and BALB/c mice (e.g., reduction of the Mtv-sensitive Vβ3, 5, 6, 11, and 12), but cross-fostering at birth had no effect, as the mice kept their genetically determined Vβ patterns ( Figure 4 A). We also detected no infectious ecotropic, polytropic, or xenotropic murine leukemia viruses by plaque assay, ruling out the role of dominant milk-borne viruses in the maternal transmission of colonic Treg phenotypes.
We then tested whether the mothers were transferring, via stool or milk, a microbial agent that would colonize the neonates. We gavaged B6 and BALB/c pups for 3 days after birth with feces or milk from BALB/c or B6 postpartum females. This treatment did not change their later RORγ+ Treg phenotype ( Figure 4 B). These data suggest that the transmission of a dominant microbe does not overcome the effect of the birth mother still in the cage.
Several other lines of evidence argued against the hypothesis that variations in microbes transmitted from the mother might lead to differential establishment of colonic Treg pools. First, classic co-housing of adult B6 and BALB/c mice never resulted in any change in RORγ+ Treg frequencies ( Figure 4 C, left), nor did adding a virgin female of the opposite genotype together with lactating females ( Figure 4 C, right) (fathers were also routinely left in the F1 breeding cages, to no effect). Second, colonization of GF mice with stool from adult inbred mice of high or low RORγ+ Treg phenotype resulted in similarly high RORγ+ Treg levels ( Figure 4 D), indicating that microbes from low strains like CBA and BALB/c were quite capable inducers (as expected from the large proportion of bacterial strains that can elicit such responses; Sefik et al., 2015 58. Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Oh, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, we used 16S and metagenomic profiling to test directly whether the genotype of the mother modified the gut microbiomes of their offspring in F1 intercrosses or during cross-fostering. In 3-day-old neonates, the gut microbiota was extremely simple as expected ( Yatsunenko et al., 2012; Knoop et al., 2015 39. Knoop, K.A. ∙ McDonald, K.G. ∙ McCrate, S. ... Microbial sensing by goblet cells controls immune surveillance of luminal antigens in the colon Mucosal Immunol. 2015; 8 :198-210 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Yatsunenko, T. ∙ Rey, F.E. ∙ Manary, M.J. ... Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography Nature. 2012; 486 :222-227 Crossref Scopus (5629) PubMed Google Scholar ), dominated by Lactobacilli ( murinis or johnsonii ) and Prevotella pneumotropica ( Figure 4 E). Although these species varied widely, their distribution reflected cage-of-origin effects but neither the pups’ nor the foster mothers’ genotypes, thus unrelated to the transmitted Treg trait. In adults, a first metagenomic analysis of fecal bacterial populations in F1 or cross-fostered mice revealed no species or pathway significantly associated with maternally determined bias ( Figures S3 C and S3D) . For increased power, we performed 16S fecal rDNA profiling on another 48 F1 mice from either B6 or BALB/c mothers (24 independent breeding cages, Table S2 ). Differential representation analysis, or a random forest classification procedure, did identify a few taxons (all Clostridiales ) with differential representation in F1 mice from B6 or BALB/c mothers, which permutation testing showed to be significant, beyond strong cage-of-origin effects ( Figures 4 F and S3 E; Table S2 ). However, their relative frequencies in individual mice was unrelated to Treg proportions ( Figure 4 G). In addition, pairwise UniFrac distances are much closer between mice that share a cage than those that merely share a maternal genotype ( Figure S3 E), which contrasts with the segregation of the Treg phenotype (no cage-of-origin effect). Thus, while B6 or BALB/c mothers do preferentially pass on different microbiota (particularly Clostridiales ) to their offspring, this appears unrelated to the Treg phenotype.
While microbes are required to induce RORγ+ Tregs ( Sefik et al., 2015; Ohnmacht et al., 2015 50. Ohnmacht, C. ∙ Park, J.H. ∙ Cording, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. The microbiota regulates type 2 immunity through RORγ + T cells Science. 2015; 349 :989-993 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Oh, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ), the maternally transmitted phenotype was not manifestly dependent on a single microbe or a defined group of microbes. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we treated pregnant B6 and BALB/c females with VMNA for the last 5 or 2 days of gestation, and asked whether they could still transmit their phenotype to fostered newborns. Antibiotic-treated B6 mothers were no longer able to transfer their high phenotype to their foster BALB/c pups but treated BALB/c mothers could still reduce levels in their B6 fosters ( Figure 4 H). This split suggests that the presence of microbes was important in determining the high RORγ+ Treg phenotype in the first days of life, even if the microbiota itself was not the differentially transmitted trait ( Figure 4 H).
As an alternative approach to identify the mechanism of maternal transmission, we immuno-profiled colon lamina propria (LP) cells in B6xBalb/c F1 progeny and cross-fostered mice. In both 3-day-old neonates and 6-week-old adults, the majority of lymphoid or myeloid populations proved to be unaffected by maternal transmission ( Figure S4 ; Table S3 ), including CX3CR1+ DCs, which have been associated with RORγ+ Treg differentiation ( Solomon and Hsieh, 2016 62. Solomon, B.D. ∙ Hsieh, C.S. Antigen-Specific Development of Mucosal Foxp3+RORγt+ T Cells from Regulatory T Cell Precursors J. Immunol. 2016; 197 :3512-3519 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). There were maternally influenced differences in type 2 and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in 3-day-old pups, but these differences did not persist in adults ( Figure S5 A; Table S3 ). On the other hand, we detected two traits with clear evidence of maternal transmission and prolonged stability. First, judging from a panel of activation markers, the activation status in LP CD4+ T cells was higher in adult F1 mice born to B6 than to BALB/c mothers, most clearly in conventional T cells but also in RORγ+ Tregs ( Figure 5 A; Table S3 ). Second, adult F1 mice born to BALB/c mothers had significantly higher frequencies of immunoglobulin A (IgA)+ B220− plasma cells in the colon and small intestine (but not Peyer’s patches or bone marrow) than did those from B6 mothers ( Figures 5 B and S5 B), which was associated with high IgA in stool and serum ( Figure 5 C). Correspondingly, the coating of stool bacteria by IgA, but not IgG, was also different in F1 mice of both origins ( Figures 5 D and S5 C), with an inverse correlation with RORγ+ Treg frequencies. This difference in IgA did not entail differences in T follicular helpers in the Peyer’s patches ( Figure S5 D) as reported in other contexts ( Koch et al., 2016; Hirota et al., 2013 32. Hirota, K. ∙ Turner, J.E. ∙ Villa, M. ... Plasticity of Th17 cells in Peyer’s patches is responsible for the induction of T cell-dependent IgA responses Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Koch, M.A. ∙ Reiner, G.L. ∙ Lugo, K.A. ... Maternal IgG and IgA antibodies dampen mucosal T helper cell responses in early life Cell. 2016; 165 :827-841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). The negative correlation between RORγ+ Treg and IgA production extended to other inbred strains ( Figure 5 E). Bacterial coating by IgA in adult mice reflects their own ability to produce IgA. Interestingly, similar differences were detected in 3-day-old neonates, at a time when all gut IgA is of maternal origin ( Figure 5 F, left), whether in F1 or in cross-fostered pups ( Figure 5 , right), and in keeping with the different IgA content of B6 and BALB/c milk ( Figure 5 G). Thus, the IgA received from its mother seems to be a harbinger of a mouse’s IgA production and coating of bacteria as an adult. We have not formally shown that milk transfer alone can result in IgA differences, which would be technically daunting (neonates must be fed every 2 h), but we infer that milk must be the vector of maternal transmission by elimination of other options ( Figure 5 ).
Importantly, the IgA coating phenotype set by the mother was then transmissible by females to their own offspring, with a multi-generational pattern of maternal transmission strikingly similar to that of RORγ+ Treg levels ( Figure 5 H), including the same trend of reversion to the genetic type after several generations. Thus, the proportions of colonic RORγ+ Tregs and IgA+ plasma cells (and the degree of IgA coating of gut microbes) were inversely correlated, both learned during the postnatal period, and maternally transmitted through multiple generations.
Next, we explored the entero-mammary axis, or how variations in gut IgA might be reflected in the milk and result in multi-generational transfer of the IgA setpoint. First, we measured IgA+ plasma cells in the intestine and mammary gland of B6 mice during pregnancy and at different stages of lactation. There was a strong expansion (6-fold on average) of intestinal IgA+ plasma cells in pregnant females (E18.5) compared with virgins (V), which continued during the first few days of lactation ( Figure 6 A). This expansion was also reflected in the mammary gland ( Figure 6 A). During pregnancy and lactation, intestinal plasma cells are thought to migrate to the mammary gland, and then contribute to milk Ig ( Roux et al., 1977; Wilson and Butcher, 2004 56. Roux, M.E. ∙ McWilliams, M. ∙ Phillips-Quagliata, J.M. ... Origin of IgA-secreting plasma cells in the mammary gland J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146 :1311-1322 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Wilson, E. ∙ Butcher, E.C. CCL28 controls immunoglobulin (Ig)A plasma cell accumulation in the lactating mammary gland and IgA antibody transfer to the neonate J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200 :805-809 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested the migration of plasma cells from the gut to the mammary gland using Kaede photoconvertible reporter mice, which we used previously to assess migration from the gut to other tissues by photoconverting intestinal tissues and searching for migrated lymphocytes at later time-points ( Tomura et al., 2008; Morton et al., 2014 47. Morton, A.M. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Upadhyay, R. ... Endoscopic photoconversion reveals unexpectedly broad leukocyte trafficking to and from the gut Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6696-6701 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar 66. Tomura, M. ∙ Yoshida, N. ∙ Tanaka, J. ... Monitoring cellular movement in vivo with photoconvertible fluorescence protein “Kaede” transgenic mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :10871-10876 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated Kaede+ (B6xBalb F1) females, who were impregnated. Sections of their intestines were photoconverted on the day of birth, and mammary glands analyzed 48 h later for photoconverted red cells of gut origin ( Figure 6 B). Cells that had migrated from the gut were indeed detected in the mammary glands at L3 ( Figure 6 C), and in numbers equal or greater to those homing to the spleen or the bone marrow ( Figure 6 D). Thus, late pregnancy is accompanied by an upsurge in the number of intestinal plasma cells, which traffic actively to the mammary gland.
We then compared the migration of IgA+ plasma cells with the mammary glands of F1 mothers who themselves had B6 or BALB/c mothers. No significant difference was seen ( Figure 6 E), which was consistent with the comparable numbers of IgA+ plasma cells present in mammary glands of these F1 mice ( Figure 6 F). On the other hand, despite these similar rates of entero-mammary migration, milk IgA was significantly higher in F1 mice originating from BALB/c versus B6 mothers ( Figure 6 G), which we conclude must arise from differences in circulating IgA protein rather than migrating cells.
These observations led us to consider the model illustrated in Figure 7 A, which incorporates our results with findings from prior reports ( Neumann et al., 2019; Wilson and Butcher, 2004; Roux et al., 1977 49. Neumann, C. ∙ Blume, J. ∙ Roy, U. ... c-Maf-dependent T reg cell control of intestinal T H 17 cells and IgA establishes host-microbiota homeostasis Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :471-481 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Roux, M.E. ∙ McWilliams, M. ∙ Phillips-Quagliata, J.M. ... Origin of IgA-secreting plasma cells in the mammary gland J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146 :1311-1322 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Wilson, E. ∙ Butcher, E.C. CCL28 controls immunoglobulin (Ig)A plasma cell accumulation in the lactating mammary gland and IgA antibody transfer to the neonate J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200 :805-809 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ): RORγ+ Tregs and IgA reciprocally inhibit each other in adult mice. High levels of IgA and bacterial IgA coating established after birth set the balance that will be maintained during the life of the animal. This balance in the gut then determines the level of IgA that the female will pass on to her own progeny, thus creating a multi-generational transmission loop. We attempted to test the key tenets of this model.
Do RORγ+ Tregs inhibit IgA+ plasma cells, or the reverse, or both? First, we bred paired Ig-deficient BALB/c. Jh−/− and wild-type BALB/c. Jh+/+ female littermates, impregnated them, and used them to foster splits of B6 litters. Remarkably, adult B6 mice that had been fostered by a BALB/c. Jh−/− mother had high proportions of RORγ+ Tregs and low IgA coating of their intestinal microbes, unlike those fostered by a wild-type BALB/c female ( Figure 7 B). The same relationship was observed in F1 mice derived from BALB/c. Jh−/− mothers, who acquired RORγ+ Treg and IgA proportions similar to those of F1 mice derived from B6 mothers ( Figures 7 C and S5 E). The Ig status of the mothers also influenced the activation states of colonic Tregs in F1 offspring ( Figure S5 F). Finally, to ensure that these effects were indeed linked to IgA, we compared F1 mice born from BALB/c. Iga−/− or WT BALB/c mothers. Here again, RORγ+ Tregs in the F1 offspring of IgA-deficient mothers were comparable with those of mice born of B6 mothers ( Figure 7 D). Thus, IgA received at birth from foster mothers set the later phenotypic tone of both RORγ+ Tregs and IgA production. IgA appeared to drive the phenotypes.
We then analyzed Foxp3-Cre.RORc fl/fl or Foxp3-Cre.Ikzf2 fl/fl conditional knockout mice, who are deficient in RORγ+ or Helios+ Tregs, respectively ( Thornton et al., 2010; Sefik et al., 2015 58. Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Oh, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Thornton, A.M. ∙ Korty, P.E. ∙ Tran, D.Q. ... Expression of Helios, an Ikaros transcription factor family member, differentiates thymic-derived from peripherally induced Foxp3+ T regulatory cells J. Immunol. 2010; 184 :3433-3441 Crossref Scopus (1080) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice deficient in RORγ+ Tregs, but not in Helios+ Tregs, displayed an increase in IgA coating of microbes ( Figure 7 E). These results, which are consistent with results in c-Maf deficient mice ( Neumann et al., 2019 49. Neumann, C. ∙ Blume, J. ∙ Roy, U. ... c-Maf-dependent T reg cell control of intestinal T H 17 cells and IgA establishes host-microbiota homeostasis Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :471-481 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggest that RORγ+ Tregs also drove the phenotypes.
Together, these results validate the double-negative feedback loop between IgA and RORγ+ Tregs, where maternally derived IgA, which preceded both RORγ+ Treg appearance and self-IgA production, initially sets the transmissible balance.

Section: Discussion

We serendipitously discovered that the preponderance of RORγ+ Tregs, an immune cell type crucial for intestinal homeostasis, was quantitatively influenced by the mother. The RORγ+ Treg phenotype was set during a very early and short postnatal window, was stably maintained throughout adulthood, and was passed on by daughters to their offspring for multiple generations. The transmission of the RORγ+ Treg phenotype was not dependent on genetics or epigenetics, nor on transfer of microbiota; instead, it required maternal Ig, and variation in IgA production followed a strikingly similar, but inverse pattern of maternally transmitted and multi-generational heritability.
Integrating these phenomena (influence of the immediate postnatal period but not of gestational mother, carryforward to adult immunocytes that aren’t yet present in the imprinted neonate, serial multi-generational transmission of anti-correlated IgA and RORγ+ Treg traits) led us to the model outlined above. Strain-specific maternal transfer of IgA levels via milk in early life leads to differential coating of microbes in the postnatal intestine, which modifies their stimulatory properties and their ability to induce RORγ+ Tregs. In adults, RORγ+ Tregs and IgA+ B cells regulate each other, in a double-negative feedback loop. Finally, when the female mouse becomes pregnant herself, the low or high IgA traits are passed on via milk IgA, which repeats the cycle and ensures multi-generational transmission.
Several examples of the transmission of maternal factors that influence the physiology of the offspring and their later immunologic functions have been described in both mice and humans. Most fundamentally, the mother transmits part of her genome and the epigenetic DNA modifications linked to parental imprinting, or those linked to maternal nutrition ( Heard and Martienssen, 2014 30. Heard, E. ∙ Martienssen, R.A. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: myths and mechanisms Cell. 2014; 157 :95-109 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tracing back to Ehrlich’s foundational work in 1891 (see Silverstein, 2000 60. Silverstein, A.M. The most elegant immunological experiment of the XIX century Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1 :93-94 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), maternal transfer of Igs has long been known to have a major impact on progeny. In a form of passive immunization, maternal Ig protects the neonate against infections, modifies the ability of the offspring to mount immune responses, and may condition autoimmune or allergic disease ( Zinkernagel, 2001; Lemke et al., 2004; Bunker and Bendelac, 2018 11.

Maternal antibodies, childhood infections, and autoimmune diseases N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345 :1331-1335 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the gut, maternal poly-specific IgA limits the penetration of commensal intestinal bacteria, and hence dampens responses against them ( Harris et al., 2006; Koch et al., 2016; Bunker and Bendelac, 2018 11.

Maternal IgG and IgA antibodies dampen mucosal T helper cell responses in early life Cell. 2016; 165 :827-841 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ), functions also observed in breast-fed humans (e.g., Gopalakrishna et al., 2019 27. Gopalakrishna, K.P. ∙ Macadangdang, B.R. ∙ Rogers, M.B. ... Maternal IgA protects against the development of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1110-1115 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mother also contributes microbes and their metabolites, which are essential for early colonization and shaping the local immune system, transplacentally and postnatally ( Honda and Littman, 2012; Macpherson et al., 2017 33. Honda, K. ∙ Littman, D.R. The microbiome in infectious disease and inflammation Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :759-795 Crossref Scopus (634) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Macpherson, A.J. ∙ de Agüero, M.G. ∙ Ganal-Vonarburg, S.C. How nutrition and the maternal microbiota shape the neonatal immune system Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :508-517 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transmission of microbes from mother to progeny has the potential for multi-generational effects ( Sonnenburg et al., 2016 64. Sonnenburg, E.D. ∙ Smits, S.A. ∙ Tikhonov, M. ... Diet-induced extinctions in the gut microbiota compound over generations Nature. 2016; 529 :212-215 Crossref Scopus (1197) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet other maternal factors transmitted through milk, such as growth factors or milk polysaccharides, may also modulate responses to microbes in early life by altering trans-epithelial passage or biasing the growth of bacterial species ( Knoop et al., 2015; Zivkovic et al., 2011 39. Knoop, K.A. ∙ McDonald, K.G. ∙ McCrate, S. ... Microbial sensing by goblet cells controls immune surveillance of luminal antigens in the colon Mucosal Immunol. 2015; 8 :198-210 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar 77. Zivkovic, A.M. ∙ German, J.B. ∙ Lebrilla, C.B. ... Human milk glycobiome and its impact on the infant gastrointestinal microbiota Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :4653-4658 Crossref Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of these, which were at play here? Most immediately, genetic and epigenetic transmission, and transplacental effects, were ruled out by the transmission in the first few days of life. That BALB/c and B6 mothers and their female descendants might differentially transmit an RORγ+ Treg-inducing microbe would be compatible with the timing but was largely ruled out by the experiments of Figure 4 , and by our inability to find a consistent differential transmission of bacteria that correlates with the Treg phenotype in either neonates or adults. These results are compatible with those of Fransen and colleagues, who only reported a very modest difference in overall diversity between B6 and BALB/c mice ( Fransen et al., 2015 22. Fransen, F. ∙ Zagato, E. ∙ Mazzini, E. ... BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice differ in polyreactive IgA abundance, which impacts the generation of antigen-specific IgA and microbiota diversity Immunity. 2015; 43 :527-540 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, it seems implausible that differential passage of a single microbe or genus could possibly lead to the constant difference between F1 progeny, one found in every mouse, and in mice from all colonies, when RORγ+ Treg induction is known to be a widespread trait among gut commensals ( Sefik et al., 2015 58. Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Oh, S. ... MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, it seems difficult to imagine how a differential propensity of B6 and BALB/c mice to produce milk polysaccharides or growth factors could be transmitted through generations. However, the realization that IgA production in the gut and milk was a mirror image of RORγ+ Treg levels provided a key clue to understand multi-generational transmission.
Our observations, combined with previously reported results, elucidate the mechanisms underlying the various steps of the model. (1) Treg regulation of IgA: such regulation is conceptually straightforward, given these cells’ habitual role in dampening the function of other immunocytes and given previous reports that Foxp3-IgA axis is involved in the maintenance of microbial populations and intestinal homeostasis. Paradoxically, these studies reported a positive effect of Tregs on IgA production ( Cong et al., 2009; Kawamoto et al., 2014 17. Cong, Y. ∙ Feng, T. ∙ Fujihashi, K. ... A dominant, coordinated T regulatory cell-IgA response to the intestinal microbiota Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :19256-19261 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar 37.

Foxp3( + ) T cells regulate immunoglobulin a selection and facilitate diversification of bacterial species responsible for immune homeostasis Immunity. 2014; 41 :152-165 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ), but they did not discriminate Treg subpopulations, and their interpretation could be complicated by the effect of acute and complete Treg depletion. More recently, in accord with the present findings, mice with c-Maf-deficient Tregs showed increases in colonic IgA+ plasma cells and IgA coating of microbes ( Neumann et al., 2019 49. Neumann, C. ∙ Blume, J. ∙ Roy, U. ... c-Maf-dependent T reg cell control of intestinal T H 17 cells and IgA establishes host-microbiota homeostasis Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :471-481 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). (2) IgA dampening RORγ Treg cells: coating by IgA modulates how commensals are sensed by the immune system ( Bunker et al., 2017; Bunker et al., 2015; Bunker and Bendelac, 2018 11. Bunker, J.J. ∙ Bendelac, A. IgA responses to microbiota Immunity. 2018; 49 :211-224 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar 12. Bunker, J.J. ∙ Flynn, T.M. ∙ Koval, J.C. ...

Bunker, J.J. ∙ Erickson, S.A. ∙ Flynn, T.M. ... Natural polyreactive IgA antibodies coat the intestinal microbiota Science. 2017; 358 :eaan6619 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ), and pro-inflammatory species of commensal bacteria are more prone to high IgA coating ( Palm et al., 2014 52. Palm, N.W. ∙ de Zoete, M.R. ∙ Cullen, T.W. ... Immunoglobulin A coating identifies colitogenic bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease Cell. 2014; 158 :1000-1010 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (909) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that IgA coating dampens RORγ+ Treg induction and underlies the “return” arm of the IgA < > RORγ+ Treg negative regulatory loop, reflecting several possible mechanisms because stimulatory epitopes on the bacteria would be shielded by IgA ( Harris et al., 2006 29. Harris, N.L. ∙ Spoerri, I. ∙ Schopfer, J.F. ... Mechanisms of neonatal mucosal antibody protection J. Immunol. 2006; 177 :6256-6262 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ), or because IgA coating could alter the microbes’ ability to come into close contact with the mucosa ( Donaldson et al., 2018; Uchimura et al., 2018 20. Donaldson, G.P. ∙ Ladinsky, M.S. ∙ Yu, K.B. ... Gut microbiota utilize immunoglobulin A for mucosal colonization Science. 2018; 360 :795-800 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar 67.

Antibodies Set Boundaries Limiting Microbial Metabolite Penetration and the Resultant Mammalian Host Response Immunity. 2018; 49 :545-559.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ), or because IgA coating can induce transitions in the synthesis of the target epitope, as shown for an IgA monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets B. thetaiotamicron ( Peterson et al., 2007 53. Peterson, D.A. ∙ McNulty, N.P. ∙ Guruge, J.L. ... IgA response to symbiotic bacteria as a mediator of gut homeostasis Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2 :328-339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (670) PubMed Google Scholar ). Either (or several) of these mechanisms could dampen RORγ+ Treg induction and the observed differences in T cell activation. (3) Persistence from the neonate to the adult: there is certainly precedent in mucosal immunology for influences on the postnatal immune system that project to adulthood ( Olszak et al., 2012; Al Nabhani et al., 2019; Gomez de Agüero et al., 2016; Constantinides et al., 2019 3.

Microbial exposure during early life has persistent effects on natural killer T cell function Science. 2012; 336 :489-493 Crossref Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the conundrum here is that the cells affected (RORγ+ Treg and IgA+ B cells) are not present in the postnatal days when the signal is received. Persistence could be explained by a remnant effect on the microbiota, by stable effects on the gut epithelial, stromal, or neuronal micro-environment, or by the demonstrated ability of maternally derived Ig to influence later immune responses, for instance by biasing specific antigen presentation ( Lemke et al., 2004 41. Lemke, H. ∙ Coutinho, A. ∙ Lange, H. Lamarckian inheritance by somatically acquired maternal IgG phenotypes Trends Immunol. 2004; 25 :180-186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). (4) Information transfer from gut to milk: the last step in the model requires the RORγ+ Treg and IgA setpoints in the gut to be transferred to the mammary gland, such that the cycle can be re-initiated. RORγ+ Tregs themselves can’t be the conduit, as they are essentially absent from the lactating mammary gland (data not shown); IgA itself or IgA-producing cells are thus more likely vectors to set IgA levels in the milk. The colonization of the mammary gland by IgA-producing plasma cells of gut origin ( Roux et al., 1977; Wilson and Butcher, 2004 56. Roux, M.E. ∙ McWilliams, M. ∙ Phillips-Quagliata, J.M. ... Origin of IgA-secreting plasma cells in the mammary gland J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146 :1311-1322 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Wilson, E. ∙ Butcher, E.C. CCL28 controls immunoglobulin (Ig)A plasma cell accumulation in the lactating mammary gland and IgA antibody transfer to the neonate J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200 :805-809 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as transport of circulating IgA from the blood via the pIgR transporter ( Johansen and Kaetzel, 2011 34. Johansen, F.E. ∙ Kaetzel, C.S. Regulation of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and IgA transport: new advances in environmental factors that stimulate pIgR expression and its role in mucosal immunity Mucosal Immunol. 2011; 4 :598-602 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been described, so we assume that these processes will carry-over the transmission of gut-level differences to the milk, and thus to the next generation, ensuring the multi-generational transmission.
Importantly, we are not proposing here that IgA-coating of inducing microbes is the sole regulator of RORγ+ Treg levels. This is an actively researched topic, and several non-mutually exclusive intermediates have been proposed to mediate the impact of the microbiome on RORγ+ Tregs, some more controversially than others: short-chain fatty acids ( Arpaia et al., 2013; Furusawa et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013; Ohnmacht et al., 2015; Al Nabhani et al., 2019 3.

Immunol. 2018; 3 :eaat6975 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ), and neuronal influences ( Yissachar et al., 2017 75. Yissachar, N. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Ung, L. ... An intestinal organ culture system uncovers a role for the nervous system in microbe-immune crosstalk Cell. 2017; 168 :1135-1148.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). We suggest that the maternally controlled regulation may come in to modulate these influences, e.g., by fixing the range in which these factors can operate.
Another interesting observation from our study is that over several generations, the genetic influence tended to reset maternal influence, which explains why B6 and BALB/c mice from three different suppliers showed the same RORγ+ Treg skew. In addition, while BALB/c and B6 offspring responded in the same direction to maternal factors, BALB/c mice never quite reached the RORγ+ Treg levels of B6 mice, and vice versa. Thus, the genetically determined and maternally transmitted factors buffer each other in setting the levels of this key immunoregulatory population. Mice with lower RORγ+ Treg fractions were better protected from intestinal infection, while those with higher proportions were less susceptible to colitis, cancer, and allergy, highlighting the advantage of balancing selection for the trait. From a Darwinian standpoint, IgA and Treg-based transmission allows a more rapid adaptation to environmental variation than DNA-based genetic selection and provides a degree of hysteresis because optimal immunoregulatory balances and adaptation to commensals are preserved between generations. It can thus be seen as an intermediate between genetic selection and the fast but ultimately lost adjustments of an individual’s adaptive immune system. Importantly, the resetting of RORγ+ Treg levels after the strong perturbation provoked by DSS was later transmitted to progeny, underscoring that events in one generation can condition immune phenotypes in the next. This resetting was maintained for several weeks after DSS, but it remains to be seen whether, in the real world outside an SPF colony, strong environmental changes might alter the neonatally determined setpoint.
RORγ+ Tregs influence colonic inflammation and cancer and have been implicated in food allergies ( Blatner et al., 2012; Abdel-Gadir et al., 2019; Sefik et al., 2015; Ohnmacht et al., 2015; Al Nabhani et al., 2019 1.

MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY. Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our observations thus have important implications in understanding the heritability of these complex disorders that characteristically have an important heritable component, usually only partially accounted for by genetic variation ( Manolio et al., 2009; Jostins et al., 2012 35. Jostins, L. ∙ Ripke, S. ∙ Weersma, R.K. ..., International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) Host-microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2012; 491 :119-124 Crossref Scopus (3643) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Manolio, T.A. ∙ Collins, F.S. ∙ Cox, N.J. ... Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases Nature. 2009; 461 :747-753 Crossref Scopus (6325) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results suggest that maternal transfer of RORγ+ Treg setpoints may contribute to “missing heritability.” Maternal immunologic transmission could also plausibly partake in the rapid rise in incidence of allergies and autoimmune diseases over the past decades, which are too rapid to be explained by genetic changes ( Cho and Gregersen, 2011 15. Cho, J.H. ∙ Gregersen, P.K. Genomics and the multifactorial nature of human autoimmune disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365 :1612-1623 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ). These maternal factors would best be factored in for the design and interpretation of GWAS studies.
In summary, this study highlights the non-genetic transfer of an important immunoregulatory trait by immunologic means, for which the entero-mammary axis provides the mechanistic underpinning of multi-generational matrilineal transmission. Several of the model’s steps require further exploration, but the multi-generational propagation of RORγ+ Tregs and IgA may be an important tenet when considering the evolution of immune responses and autoimmune diseases.

C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice were purchased from Jackson, Taconic, and Charles River, CBA/J, and NOD mice were purchased from Jackson, and were maintained in specific pathogen free conditions at Harvard Medical School. Jh−/− mice on the BALB/c background were purchased from Taconic, IgA−/− mice were obtained from D. Kasper and bred in our facility to generate wild-type and homozygous littermate controls for use as mothers. Rorc fl/fl Foxp3-cre mice were bred and maintained in our facility. Ikzf2 fl/fl mice were obtained from H. Cantor and were crossed to Foxp3-gfp-cre in our facility. Kaede reporter mice were obtained from O. Kanagawa (RIKEN, Wako, Japan) and maintained on the B6 background ( Tomura et al., 2008; Morton et al., 2014 47. Morton, A.M. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Upadhyay, R. ...

For strain intercross experiments, F1 mice were generated by crossing B6 males and females with BALB/c females and males respectively. F1 crosses of NODxCBA, B6xCBA, NODxBalb/c, and Kaede F1 (B6xBalb/c) were generated similarly. For backcross experiments, F1 females born to B6 mothers were chosen at random and crossed to BALB/c males. Female offspring of every subsequent generation were chosen at random and crossed to BALB/c males. The RORγ+ Treg phenotype of each backcrossed generation was determined from littermates of the breeding females. Backcross of F1 females born to BALB/c mothers were generated by crossing every generation to B6 males. All experiments, unless otherwise specified in the text, were performed in mice of mixed gender at six weeks of age.
For cross-fostering experiments, pups were given foster moms at birth before the appearance of milk spots in their stomach. Generally, a single litter of pups was split between the test foster mother and the control foster mother. The pups to be fostered were gently placed in dirty bedding and nesting of the foster mother to transfer her scent and then placed with the foster mother. The foster pups were monitored for signs of rejection, in which case the pups were euthanized. B6 and BALB/c germ-free mice were bred and maintained in our facility at Harvard Medical School. All experiments were performed following guidelines listed in animal protocols IS00000187 and IS00001257, approved by Harvard Medical School’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
For mono-colonization, GF mice were orally gavaged with single bacterial species at 4 weeks of age for 2 weeks. Stool was collected and plated at 2 weeks to verify colonization and rule out contamination from other species. For infection, six-week-old mice were orally gavaged with 1 × 10 9 cf. u of C. rodentium resuspended in 100 μL PBS. Bacterial density was confirmed by dilution plating. Stool was collected routinely to monitor colonization and bacterial clearance. For DTR experiments, six-week-old mice were injected intra-peritoneally with two doses of 20ng/g of diphtheria toxin, followed by four weeks of recovery. For DSS-colitis, mice on the B6 background were treated with 2.5% DSS for 6 days in their drinking water followed by 4 days of recovery. Inter-strain F1 mice were not susceptible to 2.5% DSS as measured by weight loss or changes in colon length, consistent with previously described strain dependent susceptibility to this model. Hence, F1 mice were given 4% DSS in their drinking water for 6 days and their colons were analyzed at day 10. For antibiotics treatment, mice were treated with 0.5mg/mL vancomycin (RPI), 1mg/mL metronidazole (Sigma-Aldrich), 1mg/mL neomycin (Fisher Scientific), 1mg/mL ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich) (VMNA) dissolved in drinking water for three weeks. Mothers were treated with VMNA from E12.5 or E15.5 to E17.5 for B6 mice, and E14 or E17 to E19 for BALB/c mice, so both groups of mothers received no antibiotics in their last day of gestation to minimize the transfer of antibiotics in their milk. All antibiotic treated mothers were given foster pups and their own pups were euthanized to rule out any effect of antibiotics during gestation.
The mother is separated from her litter for 3 h prior to milking. Pups were maintained in a warm nesting environment during this time. The mothers were anesthetized using an isoflurane machine and were kept under isoflurane for the entire duration of milking. The mothers were injected with 0.1 mL (2 IU) of oxytocin intraperitoneally two minutes before the start of milking and each individual teat was cleaned with alcohol pads. Mothers were milked using a home-made apparatus, with modified tubing attached to a store-bought double electric breast pump (Lansinoh) under the lowest settings. Milk collected was stored in the refrigerator for upto 3 days for immediate gavage experiments or frozen at −20 for ELISAs.
For mono-colonization experiments, B. thetaiotamicron , P. magnus , and C. rodentium were all grown in BBL brucella blood agar plates, followed by overnight standing cultures in PYG broth under strictly anaerobic conditions (80% N 2 , 10% H 2 , 10% CO 2 ) at 37°C in an anaerobic chamber. For infection, C. rodentium was first grown on MacConkey Agar plates, followed by overnight cultures in Luria-Bertani broth with shaking at 37°C. The overnight culture was then diluted to an optical density of 0.1 followed by an additional 4 h of growth.
Intestinal tissues were measured, cleaned, and treated with RPMI containing 1 mM DTT, 20 mM EDTA and 2% FBS at 37C for 15 min to remove epithelial cells, minced and dissociated in collagenase solution (1.5mg/mL collagenase II (GIBCO), 0.5mg/mL dispase and 1%FBS in RPMI) with constant stirring at 37C for 40min. Single cell suspensions were filtered and washed with 10% RPMI solution.
Lymphocytes from spleen, bone marrow, and Peyer’s patches were obtained by mechanical disruption, followed by red blood cell lysis, and filtered and washed with 10% RPMI solution.
The resulting cells were stained with different panels of antibodies with surface markers for CD45, CD4, CD8, TCR-β, TCR-δ, NK1.1, B220, IgA, CD19, CD11c, CD11b, Ly6c, PDCA-1, F4/80, CD103, CX3CR1, CD80, CD86, MHCII, CD44, CD62L, CD69, Sca-1, CXCR5, and PD-1 (Biolegend), and intracellular markers for RORγ, FoxP3, c-Maf, Gata3 (eBioscience), Helios, IL17a, IFNγ, IL10, and IL-22 (Biolegend). For cytokine analysis, cells were treated with RMPI containing 10% FBS, 30ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), 1 μM Ionomycin (Sigma) in presence of GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) for 3.5 h. For intracellular staining of cytokines and transcription factors, cells were stained for surface markers and fixed in eBioscience Fix/Perm buffer overnight, followed by permeabilization in eBioscience permeabilization buffer at room temperature for 45 min in the presence of antibodies. Cells were acquired with a BD LSRFortessa or BD FACSymphony and analysis was performed with FlowJo 10 software.
For bacterial coating, fecal pellets were homogenized in PBS, filtered, and centrifuged to collect the bacterial fraction. This fraction was washed in PBS+1% BSA, blocked with normal rat serum, and stained with anti-IgA (eBioscience) and anti-IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS with SYTO 9 (Bacterial counting kit, Invitrogen) and analyzed by FACS. Total IgA was measured using the mouse IgA ELISA kit from Invitrogen.
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine:xylazine in combination (10 mg/kg:2 mg/kg i.p). For photoconversion of Kaede in small intestine, mouse abdomen was shaved with peanut trimmers and disinfected by triple application of betadine disinfectant alternating with 70% alcohol prior to surgery. Mice were placed on their backs with an aluminum foil blanket covering all but the shaved area, and a longitudinal 2 cm incision was made in the skin and the peritoneum to expose the intestines. Violet light (Electra Pro Series Violet Handheld Laser pointer, 405 nm, peak power < 5 mW, 3mm diameter; Laserglow Technologies) was shone onto the exposed area of the intestine for 5 s/in. Peritoneum incision is closed using chromic absorbable sutures and skin incision is closed using 6-0 Sofsilk.
For cell photoconversion in the descending colon, a custom-built fiberoptic endoscope (ZIBRA Corporation) was coupled to the handheld 405-nm laser, via an in-house, custom-made connection device (fixed mounts were purchased from ThorLabs). After cleansing the colon of fecal pellets with PBS, we inserted the fiberoptic endoscope through the anus into the descending colon to a depth of 2.5 cm. The laser was switched on, thereby exposing the inner colon to violet light (beam diameter was 3.5 mm). Subsequently, the endoscope was gently retracted, pausing at 2-mm increments for 30 s light pulses at each interval (for a total of 5 min). We estimate that this procedure allows us to photoconvert about two-fifths of the small intestine and colon combined.
Viral fractions were isolated from milk samples. Purified anti-gp52 mAbs of the IgG1 isotype ( Purdy et al., 2003 55. Purdy, A. ∙ Case, L. ∙ Duvall, M. ... Unique resistance of I/LnJ mice to a retrovirus is due to sustained interferon gamma-dependent production of virus-neutralizing antibodies J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197 :233-243 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) were bound to plastic at 3 g/mL followed by incubation with virions collected from the mouse milk via spinning through 30% sucrose cushion ( Kane et al., 2011 36. Kane, M. ∙ Case, L.K. ∙ Kopaskie, K. ... Successful transmission of a retrovirus depends on the commensal microbiota Science. 2011; 334 :245-249 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). ELISA was developed with anti–gp36TM mAb ( Purdy et al., 2003 55. Purdy, A. ∙ Case, L. ∙ Duvall, M. ... Unique resistance of I/LnJ mice to a retrovirus is due to sustained interferon gamma-dependent production of virus-neutralizing antibodies J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197 :233-243 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) coupled to biotin followed by incubation with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase.
DNA was isolated from neonate and adult stool samples using phenol/chloroform and the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). For 16S rDNA profiling, the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified with primers 515F and 806R ( Caporaso et al., 2012 14. Caporaso, J.G. ∙ Lauber, C.L. ∙ Walters, W.A. ... Ultra-high-throughput microbial community analysis on the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms ISME J. 2012; 6 :1621-1624 Crossref Scopus (6375) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ∼390-bp amplicons were purified and then subjected to multiplex sequencing (Illumina MiSeq, 251 nt x 2 pair-end reads with 12 nt index reads, all primer sequences listed in Table S2 ). Raw sequencing data were processed with QIIME2 pipelines ( Bolyen et al., 2019 9. Bolyen, E. ∙ Rideout, J.R. ∙ Dillon, M.R. ... Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2 Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :852-857 Crossref Scopus (11052) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, raw sequencing data were imported to QIIME2 and demultiplexed, then DADA2 were used for sequence quality control and feature table construction. The feature table were further used for taxonomic analysis and differential abundance testing.
DNA was isolated from neonate and adult stool samples using the DNAeasy PowerSoil kit (QIAGEN). Sequencing libraries were prepared using a plate-based method as described in ( Baym et al., 2015 7. Baym, M. ∙ Kryazhimskiy, S. ∙ Lieberman, T.D. ... Inexpensive multiplexed library preparation for megabase-sized genomes PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0128036 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ), where DNA samples were first tagmented with Nextera tagment DNA enzyme (TDE1)(Illumina), and then multiplexed using Kapa 2x HiFi HotStart PCR mix and dual-index primers (Illumina TruSeq primers S502, S503, S505, S506, S507, S508, S510, S511, N701, N702, N703, N704, N705, N706, N707, N710, N711, N712, N714, N715, all primer sequences listed in Table S2 ). Libraries were cleaned using Ampure XP beads and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform with 150 bp paired-end reads. Samples with low sequence quality were removed by FastQC ( https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ) and the contaminant reads from human and/or PhiX genomes were filtered out by KneadData ( http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/kneaddata ). Next, the reads were aligned to their pangenomes and the taxonomic and functional profiles were identified by HUMAnN2 ( Franzosa et al., 2018 23. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Rahnavard, G. ... Species-level functional profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :962-968 Crossref Scopus (951) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Data were routinely presented as mean ± SD. Unless stated otherwise, significance was assessed by Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney using GraphPad Prism 8.0.
For 16S sequencing, differential representation was evaluated in R, by comparing the mean frequency within each group, or the fraction of positive mice, and estimating the significance of the difference by a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and Bonferroni correction. Randomization was used to validate the nominal p values while preserving the cage-effects in the experimental design: which mouse pairs born from the same cage were randomly assigned to the B6 or BALB/c-derived groups, and the same comparisons performed. To parse the relative contribution of shared cage-of-origin versus shared maternal genotype ( Figure S3 B) Unifrac distances calculated by QIIME2 were compared between all mice and plotted and averaged according to the degree of sharing.
For metagenomic analysis, the taxonomy and pathway comparisons were performed by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with FDR adjusted p values.
The accession number for the 16S raw data reported in this paper is NCBI Bioproject: PRJNA610699. The accession number for the metagenomics data reported in this paper is NCBI Bioproject:PRJNA614518. OTU tables for both datasets can be found in Table S2 .
