Title: Converting Escherichia coli to a Synthetic Methylotroph Growing Solely on Methanol


Abstract: Summary

Methanol, being electron rich and derivable from methane or CO 2 , is a potentially renewable one-carbon (C1) feedstock for microorganisms. Although the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle used by methylotrophs to assimilate methanol differs from the typical sugar metabolism by only three enzymes, turning a non-methylotrophic organism to a synthetic methylotroph that grows to a high cell density has been challenging. Here we reprogrammed E. coli using metabolic robustness criteria followed by laboratory evolution to establish a strain that can efficiently utilize methanol as the sole carbon source. This synthetic methylotroph alleviated a so far uncharacterized hurdle, DNA-protein crosslinking (DPC), by insertion sequence (IS)-mediated copy number variations (CNVs) and balanced the metabolic flux by mutations. Being capable of growing at a rate comparable with natural methylotrophs in a wide range of methanol concentrations, this synthetic methylotrophic strain illustrates genome editing and evolution for microbial tropism changes and expands the scope of biological C1 conversion.

Among all C1 compounds, methanol is the most electron rich in the liquid form and can be derived from the greenhouse gases methane and CO 2 ( Conrado and Gonzalez, 2014 13.

Interfaces. 2019; 11 :18968-18977 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). It also avoids the diffusion barrier compared to those gaseous C1 compounds. In addition, methanol is already an industrial feedstock, and, thus, is potentially attractive as a substrate for bioconversion ( Bertau et al., 2014 7. Bertau, M. ∙ Offermanns, H. ∙ Plass, L. ... Methanol: the basic chemical and energy feedstock of the future Springer, 2014 Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar ). The native methanol utilization and conversion pathways in natural methylotrophs, such as Methylobacterium extorquens and Bacillus methanolicus , have been well characterized ( Bennett et al., 2018b 6. Bennett, R.K. ∙ Steinberg, L.M. ∙ Chen, W. ... Engineering the bioconversion of methane and methanol to fuels and chemicals in native and synthetic methylotrophs Curr. Opin.

Methanol assimilation in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1: demonstration of all enzymes and their regulation PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e13001 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). These organisms typically utilize the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle or the serine pathway for methanol assimilation ( Chistoserdova et al., 2009 12. Chistoserdova, L. ∙ Kalyuzhnaya, M.G. ∙ Lidstrom, M.E. The expanding world of methylotrophic metabolism Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63 :477-499 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, the enzymes involved in the RuMP cycle overlap with those used in the typical sugar metabolism ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ), except for three enzymes (methanol dehydrogenase [Medh], hexulose-6-phosphate synthase [Hps], and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase [Phi]). Thus, significant efforts have been made to convert sugar heterotrophs to methylotrophs for scientific and industrial interests by overexpressing these three enzymes ( Chen et al., 2018 10.

If this can be achieved, then the industrial biotechnology sector can include methanol as an alternative non-food carbon source using a common industrial microbe.
Despite initial successes in engineering sugar heterotrophs to assimilate methanol, it has not been possible to convert such heterotrophs to methylotrophs that efficiently utilize methanol as the sole carbon and energy source. Reported examples required other carbon sources or nutrients in the medium to support growth ( Chen et al., 2018 10. Chen, C.-T. ∙ Chen, F.Y.-H. ∙ Bogorad, I.W. ...

Kim, S. ∙ Lindner, S.N. ∙ Aslan, S. ... Growth of E. coli on formate and methanol via the reductive glycine pathway Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16 :538-545 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Apparently, successful expression of three heterologous genes is insufficient to turn E. coli into a methylotroph. Here we report a major problem involving DNA-protein crosslinking (DPC) that prevented E. coli from growing in methanol as the sole carbon source and how genome editing, copy number variations (CNVs), and mutations introduced by laboratory evolution overcame this hurdle, resulting in a synthetic methylotrophic E. coli that efficiently grows to a high OD with a doubling time of 8 h.

Section: Results

To develop a synthetic methylotroph, we began with our RuMP cycle-based methanol auxotrophy strategy ( Chen et al., 2018 10. Chen, C.-T. ∙ Chen, F.Y.-H. ∙ Bogorad, I.W. ... Synthetic methanol auxotrophy of Escherichia coli for methanol-dependent growth and production Metab. Eng. 2018; 49 :257-266 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 B; Figure S1 A). It calls for disruption of the pentose phosphate pathway by deleting rpiAB and installing methanol-utilizing genes ( medh , hps , and phi ) so that the cell can grow on methanol plus xylose in minimal medium but not on xylose alone. Thus, methanol assimilation can be used as a selection pressure during evolution. Instead of the previously established BL21 strain, we opted to reconstruct an auxotrophic E. coli BW25113 ΔrpiAB strain for its higher success rate of genome manipulation. We integrated two synthetic operons ( Figure S1 B) for stable expression, designated CFC381.0. The first operon consists of the three heterologous genes: medh (CT4-1, engineered from Cupriavidus necator ; Wu et al., 2016 40. Wu, T.-Y. ∙ Chen, C.T. ∙ Liu, J.T. ... Characterization and evolution of an activator-independent methanol dehydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator N-1 Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2016; 100 :4969-4983 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), hps (from Bacillus methanolicus ), and phi (from Methylobacillus flagellatus ). The second operon includes the same medh and phi but a different hps (from Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1S ) ( Figure S1 C) along with tkt (encoding transketolase from Methylococcus capsulatus ) and tal (encoding transaldolase from Klebsiella pneumoniae ; Lin et al., 2018 24. Lin, P.P. ∙ Jaeger, A.J. ∙ Wu, T.-Y. ... Construction and evolution of an Escherichia coli strain relying on nonoxidative glycolysis for sugar catabolism Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :3538-3546 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because enzymes from different organisms differ in michaelis constant (K m ), we intentionally expressed various isofunctional enzymes simultaneously to maximize the flexibility of metabolic flux balance. After 20 liquid transfer cycles, which we define as “passages,” the evolved strain CFC381.20 could grow from OD 600 0.1 to OD 600 1.0 in a minimal medium containing 400 mM of methanol and 20 mM xylose in 48 h ( Figures S1 D and S1E) but could not grow without methanol. As approximately 3–4 generations elapsed per passage, CFC381.20 demonstrated the methanol auxotrophy phenotype as desired within 80 generations.
Whole-genome sequencing of CFC381.20 ( Table S2 ) revealed a 4-bp insertion in the frmA gene. The inactivation of frmA, which is responsible for detoxifying formaldehyde to formic acid, has also been seen previously in similar efforts ( Chen et al., 2018 10. Chen, C.-T. ∙ Chen, F.Y.-H. ∙ Bogorad, I.W. ... Synthetic methanol auxotrophy of Escherichia coli for methanol-dependent growth and production Metab. Eng. 2018; 49 :257-266 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gonzalez et al., 2018 18. Gonzalez, J.E. ∙ Bennett, R.K. ∙ Papoutsakis, E.T. ... Methanol assimilation in Escherichia coli is improved by co-utilization of threonine and deletion of leucine-responsive regulatory protein Metab. Eng. 2018; 45 :67-74 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meyer et al., 2018 25. Meyer, F. ∙ Keller, P. ∙ Hartl, J. ... Methanol-essential growth of Escherichia coli Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1508 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that the formaldehyde flux must be directed to biosynthetic pathways for efficient methanol-dependent growth. Other significant mutations included truncation of gnd (encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [Gnd]) and a frameshift in fdoG (encoding formate dehydrogenase). Gnd forms a non-productive cycle with Hps, Phi, Pgi, and Zwf, with a net reaction to convert formaldehyde to CO 2 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydride (NADPH). Similarly, frmA and fdoG drain formaldehyde to CO 2 while producing excess nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH). These mutations indicated that, through evolution, the methanol auxotrophic strain reduced competing flux away from the productive RuMP cycle for efficient biosynthesis and biomass accumulation. This methanol auxotroph strain demonstrated that the methanol assimilation branch of the RuMP cycle was functional. However, the replenishment of ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) was still supplied by xylose because the regeneration pathway was disrupted by the rpiAB deletion.
Next we attempted to close the RuMP cycle by transforming a plasmid (pFC139) that carries a ribosome binding site (RBS) library expressing rpiA so that CFC381.20 could utilize methanol as the sole carbon source. Unfortunately, the strain could only acquire a limited growth advantage after a series of evolutions in the presence of methanol while supplying additional carbon sources, such as amino acids or xylose. We then hypothesized that kinetic traps in the system curtailed the flux during methanol assimilation. To identify them, we used ensemble modeling for robustness analysis (EMRA; Lee et al., 2014 23. Lee, Y. ∙ Lafontaine Rivera, J.G. ∙ Liao, J.C. Ensemble Modeling for Robustness Analysis in engineering non-native metabolic pathways Metab. Eng. 2014; 25 :63-71 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rivera et al., 2015 31. Rivera, J.G.L. ∙ Lee, Y. ∙ Liao, J.C. An entropy-like index of bifurcational robustness for metabolic systems Integr. Biol. (Camb.). 2015; 7 :1-9 Google Scholar ), which examines a large number of models with different kinetic parameters and perturbs them by varying enzyme maximum rate (V max ), which is largely proportional to the expression levels. It then detects the models that become unstable after increasing or decreasing each V max up to 10-fold and reports the percentage of stable models after each perturbation. If the system becomes unstable sharply after a small perturbation in the V max of an enzyme, then this enzyme may be involved in a kinetic trap. This analysis provides a qualitative assessment to suggest enzymes that require up- or down-expression to avoid system instability caused by kinetic traps.
The results revealed that high activities of phosphofructokinase (Pfk) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) tend to destabilize the system by diverting the flux away from the RuMP cycle ( Figure 2 ) and preventing replenishment of the cycle intermediates. Accordingly, we reduced these enzyme activities by knocking out pfkA , which accounts for 90% of the Pfk activity ( Kotlarz et al., 1975 21. Kotlarz, D. ∙ Garreau, H. ∙ Buc, H. Regulation of the amount and of the activity of phosphofructokinases and pyruvate kinases in Escherichia coli Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 381 :257-268 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), and replacing gapA with gapC from E. coli BL21 ( Wu et al., 2012 39. Wu, Y. ∙ Wu, M. ∙ He, G. ... Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: a universal internal control for Western blots in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells Anal. Biochem. 2012; 423 :15-22 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), which possesses around 40% of K12 BW25113 gapA activity ( Figure S2 A). The resulting strain, CFC526.0, was then subjected to laboratory evolution with different strategies of nutrient weaning ( Figure 1 B).
Specifically, we grew CFC526.0 in a medium containing methanol and a defined semi-minimal medium, Hi-Def Azure (HDA), that contained amino acids. The HDA amount was sequentially reduced and replaced by a 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS)-based methanol -minimal medium (MM medium) until the culture could grow on methanol as the sole carbon source. Extra vitamins were supplied for better cell metabolism. Nitrate was initially supplied as an extra electron acceptor in addition to oxygen because methanol is an electron-rich substrate, and oxygen transfer may be limiting in shaking flasks. After about 180 days and 21 passages, the culture could finally grow on methanol without any amino acid supplement ( Figure 3 A; Figure S2 B). This initial methylotrophic culture, CFC680.1, which grew solely on methanol, required 20 days to grow to saturation at OD 600 1. After 20 more passages, CFC680.20 grew to OD 600 1 within 41 h ( Figure 3 B). We evolved the culture without nitrate and generated a culture, CFC688.20, that could grow without nitrate to reach a similar growth rate ( Figure 3 C). Independently, we also obtained another methanol-growing strain, CFC526.23, by employing a slower nutrient reduction strategy and evolved it to obtain CFC526.53 ( Figure S2 C).
To ensure that all metabolic products were derived from methanol, 13 C labeling experiments were performed. CFC680.8 was passaged six times in MM medium with 13 C methanol until all isotopes reach a steady state. As expected, we found that acetate was double labeled, whereas formate was single labeled ( Figures 3 D and 3E). The isotope labeling experiments provided solid evidence that methanol was the sole carbon source for growth.
One noticeable phenotype of these methylotrophic cultures was an exceedingly long lag phase (up to 20 days) when the culture was inoculated from stationary phase ( Figure 4 A) but not from log phase. Similarly, colonies on a methanol minimal medium plate could not proliferate in a liquid minimal medium. Although microorganisms do exhibit a lag phase when inoculated from a stationary-phase culture, these synthetic methylotrophic E. coli cultures seemed to go through a “point of no return” beyond which the exceedingly long lag phase appeared. After monitoring the viability of the cells at stationary phase by flow cytometry, we found that up to 11% of the cells were dead ( Figure 4 B). We speculated that the strain may have experienced toxicity from intermediate metabolites, mostly likely formaldehyde. This was foreseeable because the inactivation of frmA inherited from the auxotrophy strain hindered the entire formaldehyde detoxification pathway.
Surveying the broad spectrum of biomolecules susceptible to formaldehyde reactions, we hypothesized that DPC was the most likely cause of cell death, which may lead to disruption of DNA replication, transcription, translation, and protein function ( Stingele and Jentsch, 2015 35. Stingele, J. ∙ Jentsch, S. DNA-protein crosslink repair Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 :455-460 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the hypothesis, we purified DPC products from methanol-growing cultures by a modified DNA extraction method ( Qin and Wang, 2009 30. Qin, H. ∙ Wang, Y. Exploring DNA-binding proteins with in vivo chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8 :1983-1991 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). After de-crosslinking the extractant, we analyzed the protein portion by SDS-PAGE. The results suggested that DPC did occur as the culture reached stationary phase ( Figure S3 A). We then imaged the isolated DPC products using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and unveiled the severity of formaldehyde crosslinking ( Figure 4 C). Typically, DNA could not be seen with negative staining without coating by proteins such as cytochrome c because the DNA string is too thin for TEM observation ( Serwer, 1978 32. Serwer, P. A technique for observing extended DNA in negatively stained specimens: observation of bacteriophage T7 capsid-DNA complexes J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 65 :112-118 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ).
As expected, during the log phase, only free protein particles were observed, most likely attributable to protein leftovers during the salting-out process. In contrast, the DPC level increased when the culture reached stationary phase (OD 600 1.2), causing the entire DNA string to be visible as protein was coated to DNA because of formaldehyde crosslinking. Moreover, we could see protein aggregates along the DNA string. At OD 600 1.5, formaldehyde-induced crosslinking became extremely severe; the DNA started to form a web-like structure by DNA-protein-DNA crosslinking or even DNA-DNA crosslinking. Noticeably, DNA strings disappeared when we heated and de-crosslinked DPCs, ruling out the possibility of DNA-protein nonspecific binding or image overlapping. DPC was less severe when the cells were growing in lower methanol concentrations ( Figures S3 B and S3C).
We then conducted quantitative proteomics to reveal that more than 500 proteins were crosslinked with DNA. The common 61 hits of the 100 proteins with the highest abundance from 3 independent samples were then visualized with a heatmap ( Figure 4 D; Figure S4 ). As expected, there was a clear trend of increasing crosslinked proteins as the culture entered stationary phase, and the protein abundance in DPC products in the same culture could differ up to 7 orders of magnitude between log phase and late stationary phase. Moreover, Gene Ontology analysis of the 61 proteins suggested that DPCs mainly consisted of ribosomes and outer membrane proteins, whereas several metabolic enzymes were also identified, such as Medh, Tkt, Tal, AceA, Eno, Pyk, and Pgk. Malfunction of these proteins may cause cell death because of outer membrane porin-induced programmed cell death ( Noor, 2015 28. Noor, R. Mechanism to control the cell lysis and the cell survival strategy in stationary phase under heat stress Springerplus. 2015; 4 :599 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) or metabolic flux imbalance. Moreover, the strong presence of ribosomes also suggested that transcription and translation were heavily affected by DPC. The accumulation of DPC could explain why the culture exhibited an exceedingly long lag phase when inoculated from a stationary-phase culture and may also shed light on the difficulty of evolving a non-methanol-utilizing bacterium to grow on methanol as the sole carbon source.
Another phenomenon identified was that the cultures evolved to grow on methanol as the sole carbon source initially failed to grow in the same medium after passing through Luria-Bertani (LB)-rich medium. This observation implied that the sub-populations emerged during evolution and were enriched in different media. To determine how CFC526.0 evolved to grow in methanol, we sequenced 18 evolved cultures in total along the evolution process ( Figure 5 A; Figure S5 ). The results showed that some mutations appeared but then vanished within a few passages. Along the evolution line, insertion sequence element 2 (IS2) was inserted upstream of two genes, gltA and ptsH , which distances their promoter away from the open reading frame. Accordingly, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity may be impeded, whereas the ptsH -encoded Hpr protein may be expressed insufficiently, causing a disruption in the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Other mutations included a 12-bp in-frame deletion in pgi and truncated ptsP and proQ . Noticeably, the heterologous genes in the two operons we integrated, which included medh , hps , phi , tkt , and tal , remained unchanged during evolution.
We also identified that the evolved mixed cultures had three high-coverage regions flanked by IS elements in their chromosomes: a 70k region spanning from yggE to yghO ( Figure 5 B) that contains many glycolytic genes and a synthetic operon, P L lac O 1 :: medh-tkt-tal-hps-phi , in the RuMP pathway; a 7k region encoding the dipeptide transporter operon ( ddp ) ( Figure 5 C); and an 130k region from rrsA to rrlB containing several 16S RNAs. The high coverage implies that the cells may have increased expression of genes in those regions.
The plasmid sequence also showed three different versions ( Figure 5 D): one (pFC139A) that contained a specific RBS from the library, one (pFC139B) that contained a triplicated untranslated region (UTR) upstream of rpiA and an IS2 insertion between the p15A replication origin and the cat gene, and another one (pFC139C) that contained the same RBS as pFC139A and an additional inserted IS2 before the promoter of the cat gene.
To evaluate the genome variation through evolution, we found that the copy number of the 70k region gradually increased up to 5.6 copies ( Figure 6 A).Plasmids pFC139A and pFC139B dominated at the early stage of evolution, but pFC139C eventually dominated at the end of evolution ( Figure 6 B).
The coherent increase in the copy number of the 70k region, pFC139C, and some single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) implies that there are two main sub-populations in the evolved CFC526 and CFC680 culture series: one real synthetic methylotrophic strain (SM1) containing pFC139C and the 70k multicopy region ( Figure 5 B) and the other non-methylotrophic strain (BB1) containing pFC139B and the 7k multicopy region but not the 70k repeated region ( Figure 5 C).
After several attempts, we isolated SM1 and BB1 single colonies by colony PCR verification of unique mutations such as pgi 12-bp deletion in SM1. The final SM1 strain retains its ability to grow on MeOH even after culturing in LB ( Figure S6 A). Moreover, the strain can also grow without any nitrate or vitamin supplementation ( Figure S6 B).
Illumina HiSeq sequencing of SM1 showed similar SNVs with increased frequency (close to 100%) compared with the last sequenced mixed culture, CFC526.30. The 70k and 130k multi-copy regions remained, whereas another 240k duplicate appeared in SM1 ( Figure 5 B). In contrast, the high-coverage 7k region disappeared, which was later identified as a unique feature of the BB1 strain ( Figure 5 C).
To determine the genome structure, we sequenced SM1 and BB1 with PacBio Sequel and Nanopore sequencing to seek longer reads. De novo assembly of these long-read sequencing results was instrumental in determining the genome structure and polishing the genome sequence. Several previously identified low-frequency SNVs from HiSeq sequencing were actually IS insertions ( Table S2 ). These long sequencing reads ( Figure S7 A) also revealed that the IS5-flanked 70k region consisted of tandem repeats ( Figure 5 B). In particular, several ultra-long mapping reads (100–130 kb) from Nanopore sequencing spanned three tandem repeats ( Figure S7 A). Comparing SM1 and the wild-type E. coli BW25113, we observed several genomic structural variations because of ISs and CNVs ( Figure S7 B).
During evolution, the copy number of the 70k tandem repeat increased, leading to 4 copies in the isolated SM1 strain ( Figure 6 A). The fine-tuning of CNV implies that the 70k tandem repeats may play an important role in synthetic methylotrophy because they host one of the artificially integrated operons, P L lac O 1 :: medh-tkt-tal-hps-phi , while also containing glycolysis and gluconeogenesis genes such as fbaA , pgk , and yggF (a fructose-bisphosphatase isozyme) ( Figure 5 B). Upregulation of the RuMP pathway enzymes may have enhanced the efficiency of methanol assimilation. The increase in yggF copy number may have further decreased Pfk flux, which is consistent with our EMRA prediction. We confirmed the copy number of the 70k tandem repeat in SM1 by digital PCR, Illumina sequencing, and long-read sequencing coverage data. Noticeably, we found that the copy number of the 70k was reduced to 3 when the strain was grown in LB. On the other hand, the copy number of the 240k and 130k duplicated regions did not vary along the evolution path.
To further investigate the correlation between methanol growth and the 70k CNV as well as the dynamics of CNV in the SM1 strain, we picked a single colony of the SM1 strain and passaged it in LB 4 times and then in methanol minimal medium (MM) to generate CNVs. We then passaged several isolated single colonies from the last MM culture through additional serial passages in LB while tracking their 70k CNVs and methanol growth abilities after LB exposure. We found that the copy number of the 70k region decreased as the strain was more exposed to LB ( Figure 6 C). After passaging the strain back to MM, it increased its copy number ( Figure 6 D) back to more than 4.5. Also, there was a correlation between the methanol growth rate and 70k copy numbers ( Figure 6 E).
On the other hand, the 7k multi-copy region unique to the BB1 strain featured a remarkable 85-fold coverage ( Figure 5 C). This region hosts the ddp operon that encodes a putative dipeptide transporter, suggesting that BB1 may be co-evolved for the purpose of utilizing dipeptides derived from the debris of SM1 after cell death. After entering stationary phase in MM medium or passing through LB, this strain took over rapidly and dominated the culture. This apparent symbiosis explained the difficulty experienced in isolating SM1 from the evolved mixed culture when we isolate strains directly from LB plates.
Balancing formaldehyde flux appears to be the most important task to avoid DPC. This task is particularly challenging when the cell needs to replenish Ru5P to react with formaldehyde in methanol-only medium. SM1 accomplished this task in log phase but still exhibited some DPC when it entered stationary phase. To probe the gene expression changes between stationary phase and the log phase, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of SM1 in MM medium and compared the mRNA transcript levels at OD 600 1.1 with OD 600 0.7. Indeed, the mRNA profile in the RuMP pathway was altered significantly in stationary phase ( Figure 7 A). The transcript levels of most RuMP genes responsible for regeneration of Ru5P, which reacts with formaldehyde, were decreased dramatically, whereas the formaldehyde-forming gene ( medh ) was less downregulated. Consequently, the flux imbalance caused the accumulation of formaldehyde. We also used qRT-PCR methods to verify that the expression changes were consistent with the RNA-seq results ( Figure 7 A). It appeared that the fine balance between formaldehyde-forming and formaldehyde-consuming flux was crucial when the cells enter stationary phase ( Figure 7 B). The Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway provides another route for entering the RuMP pathway to regenerate Ru5P. Interestingly, ED pathway genes were also downregulated more in stationary phase than the formaldehyde generation gene medh, contributing to DPC formation in stationary phase ( Figure 7 A).
An important reason for the success in evolving SM1 was the rational design guided by EMRA, which involved deletion of pfkA and gapA and expression of gapC . These genome changes were designed to direct more flux to replenish Ru5P to assimilate formaldehyde. To verify the importance of these genome edits along with other mutations introduced during laboratory evolution, we reversed these changes in SM1 and tested their phenotypes. We cloned frmA , pfkA , gapA , pgi , gltA , ptsH , ptsP , and proQ on a bacterial artificial chromosome (pBAC) under their native promoters. The results showed that reinstalling the wild-type versions of these genes had a negative effect on methanol growth ( Figure 7 D). Specifically, frmA , gapA, pgi , and ptsP showed the most significant effects, indicating that these mutations were particularly beneficial to SM1 growth. Moreover, when pfkA and gapA were reintroduced simultaneously, the strain almost stopped growing, requiring 7-day recovery to grow back to OD 600 1 ( Figure 7 D; Figure S6 C). Therefore, the rationally designed pfkA and gapA genome edits effectively created a path for genomic evolution toward efficient growth in methanol.
As mentioned previously, we found an IS2 insertion in the promoter region of gltA . Re-expressing a copy of gltA on pBAC slightly reduced the growth rate, suggesting that the IS2 insertion was instrumental for optimal SM1 growth. Moreover, RNA-seq data indicated that TCA cycle gene transcripts per million (TPMs) were much lower than in other major metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the RuMP cycle in SM1 ( Figure 7 C).
We also characterized the Pgi variant coded by the 12-bp-deleted pgi gene in SM1 using His-tag purification. Interestingly, this Pgi variant resulted in a higher specific activity, presumably increasing the flux through Zwf to produce NADPH for growth ( Figure 7 E). NADPH in wild-type E. coli mainly comes from three sources: Icd in the TCA cycle, Gnd, and Zwf in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Because Gnd is deleted and TCA cycle activity is low, as deduced from the RNA-seq data ( Figure 7 C), Zwf may have become the major NADPH source for growth.
Finally, we determined the methanol growth characteristics of SM1. This strain could grow in a wide concentration range of methanol, from 50 mM to 1.2 M, as the sole carbon source, free of nitrate ( Figure 7 F). Optimal growth was observed around 400 mM methanol; the strain grew from OD 600 0.1 to 1.0 in 30 h with a doubling time of 8 h and consumed around 120 mM of MeOH to reach a final OD 600 of 1.9. Formate and acetate were the major products ( Figure 7 G).

Section: Discussion

This work demonstrates the tropism change of a microorganism. With only three missing genes, the metabolic rewiring turns out to be unexpectedly complicated. We started from a methanol auxotrophy strategy that established the working pathway for methanol assimilation, but regeneration of the co-substrate, Ru5P, for formaldehyde conversion was supplied by an external carbon source, xylose. This methanol auxotrophy strain evolved to grow very well with one-sixth of its carbon derived from methanol. The remaining task was to wean off xylose and regenerate Ru5P by diverting part of the glycolytic flux to the RuMP cycle. Unexpectedly, this task transpired to be the most challenging and most revealing when converting E. coli to a synthetic methylotroph. In the early stage of evolution for methanol auxotrophic growth (CFC381.20), the formaldehyde detoxification gene frmA was inactivated by a frameshift mutation to direct the formaldehyde flux to the productive RuMP pathways. This gene was also artificially deleted by other groups in efforts to turn E. coli into a synthetic methylotroph ( Bennett et al., 2018a 5. Bennett, R.K. ∙ Gonzalez, J.E. ∙ Whitaker, W.B. ...

Chen, C.-T. ∙ Chen, F.Y.-H. ∙ Bogorad, I.W. ... Synthetic methanol auxotrophy of Escherichia coli for methanol-dependent growth and production Metab. Eng. 2018; 49 :257-266 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meyer et al., 2018 25. Meyer, F. ∙ Keller, P. ∙ Hartl, J. ... Methanol-essential growth of Escherichia coli Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1508 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that formaldehyde needs to be conserved in productive biosynthetic pathways for methylotrophic growth.
Because methylotrophic growth on methanol requires a proper balance between the RuMP cycle, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the ED pathway, imbalance among these pathways causes a shortage of Ru5P for formaldehyde assimilation, pyruvate for building blocks, or NADPH for biosynthesis. Shortage of Ru5P results in formaldehyde-induced DPC and then cell death. Shortage of pyruvate or NADPH hampers growth. Such a fine balance could not be designed a priori and will be very difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish by evolution within the laboratory timescale. EMRA provided a guideline to identify key enzymes that need to be up- or downregulated. According to the EMRA result, Pfk and Gapdh need to be downregulated to avoid severe imbalance among different pathways. Pfk catalyzes a major metabolic step involved in ATP consumption and tunes glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, whereas Gapdh is a key metabolic node involved in NADH generation and is a junction among glycolysis, the RuMP cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway. After implementing the EMRA-suggested genomic changes, the cells were able to gain a growth advantage in methanol and evolve toward methylotrophic growth. Without these genomic edits at the initial stage, the cells seemed to be trapped by DPC and not able to evolve at the timescale of interest.
The DPC problem was visualized by TEM, clearly demonstrating the difficulty in turning E. coli to grow in methanol. The DPC phenomenon was most significant in stationary phase. Even when the cells were able to grow in methanol, DPC killed the cells in stationary phase. It was common to observe weak growth in methanol to a low cell density over a long time frame, but such colonies or cultures were not able to evolve further, possibly because of the DPC issue. Avoiding formaldehyde accumulation appears to be the only solution because DPC is a problem on the global proteome level. Typical microbes detoxify formaldehyde by oxidizing it to CO 2 , but this strategy wastes the biosynthetic carbon source. For methylotrophy, the organism needs to achieve a fine balance among formaldehyde generation and formaldehyde consumption flux. Presumably, native methylotrophs have achieved this fine regulation through natural evolution. We solved this problem by introducing two genome edits followed by laboratory evolution.
Throughout evolution, we found divergence that created sub-populations identified by genome sequencing. Eventually, we identified two main populations, the methylotrophic SM1 and the non-methylotrophic BB1 strain ( Table S2 ). SM1 grows on methanol and produces acetate in the late growth phase, which may feed the BB1 strain for growth. In stationary phase, SM1 suffers from DPC and dies. BB1 may also have enjoyed the acetate along with nutrients from dead SM1, such as amino acids or proteins, implied by the increased copy numbers of the ddp operon. This symbiotic co-culture hypothesis explains the difficulty of isolating a pure synthetic methylotrophic strain even after several rounds of plate streaking. Whether BB1 is helpful in the evolution of SM1 or just a fortuitous by-stander remains unknown. This result suggests that divergent evolution is likely during laboratory evolution and that sequencing the evolving cultures and isolating single colonies is important after evolution.
One of the most intriguing features laboratory evolution used to solve the DPC problem is CNV. In the SM1 strain, the copy number of the 70k repeated region increased as evolution proceeded. The isolated SM1 strain showed that the copy of the 70k region decreased when the strain was cultured in LB but increased when changing from LB to methanol minimal medium ( Figure 6 D). This phenomenon was observed in all colonies we tested. It appears that SM1 uses CNV dynamically to adapt to a new environment. The co-evolved non-methylotrophic BB1 strain does not contain the high copy 70k region but acquired an extremely high (85) copy of the 7k region. It implies that CNV plays an important role in laboratory evolution for adapting to a challenging environment. Although CNVs are commonly observed and studied in eukaryotic systems such as cancer cells ( Shlien and Malkin, 2009 33. Shlien, A. ∙ Malkin, D. Copy number variations and cancer Genome Med. 2009; 1 :62-69 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ) and fruit flies ( Zhou et al., 2011 41. Zhou, J. ∙ Lemos, B. ∙ Dopman, E.B. ... Copy-number variation: the balance between gene dosage and expression in Drosophila melanogaster Genome Biol. Evol. 2011; 3 :1014-1024 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), CNVs in monoploid bacteria have not been well characterized, with some notable exceptions ( De Meur et al., 2018 15. De Meur, Q. ∙ Deutschbauer, A. ∙ Koch, M. ... Genetic Plasticity and Ethylmalonyl Coenzyme A Pathway during Acetate Assimilation in Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H under Photoheterotrophic Conditions Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2018; 84 :e02038-17 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tyo et al., 2009 37. Tyo, K.E.J. ∙ Ajikumar, P.K. ∙ Stephanopoulos, G. Stabilized gene duplication enables long-term selection-free heterologous pathway expression Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27 :760-765 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). How E. coli dynamically tuned CNV along with environmental changes remains to be explored.
Moreover, the copy number for the 70k region in the initial CFC526.0 strain was already 2, indicating that CNVs may have occurred since methanol auxotrophy evolution. This may also explain why our stepwise evolution strategy is effective. Without this auxotroph strategy to prepare the genomic background, we probably would not have obtained this critical 70k region available for further copy number increase and optimization.
The synthetic methylotroph SM1 strain also benefitted from other mutations, such as the 12-bp deletion in pgi , which increased its activity ( Figure 7 E). It is likely that Pgi activity diverts part of the flux to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and generates NADPH for growth. The carbon flux then feeds into the ED pathway to generate pyruvate for growth and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) for the RuMP pathway ( Figure 1 A).
After extensive evolution, the final synthetic methylotroph strain exhibits an 8.5-h doubling time (t D ) and methanol tolerance (up to 1.2 M), comparable with native methylotrophs such as Methylobacterium extorquen s AM1, (t D = 4 h; Nayak and Marx, 2014 27. Nayak, D.D. ∙ Marx, C.J. Genetic and phenotypic comparison of facultative methylotrophy between Methylobacterium extorquens strains PA1 and AM1 PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e107887 e10 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ), Methylobacterium extorquen s TK0001 (t D = 4–6 h; Belkhelfa et al., 2019 4. Belkhelfa, S. ∙ Roche, D. ∙ Dubois, I. ... Continuous Culture Adaptation of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 and TK 0001 to Very High Methanol Concentrations Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10 :1313 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Pichia pastoris (t D = 8.2 h; Moser et al., 2017 26. Moser, J.W. ∙ Prielhofer, R. ∙ Gerner, S.M. ... Implications of evolutionary engineering for growth and recombinant protein production in methanol-based growth media in the yeast Pichia pastoris Microb. Cell Fact. 2017; 16 :49 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) under methanol-only conditions.
Future engineering efforts can be implemented for balancing flux at the stationary phase to avoid DPCs. Such a synthetic methylotrophic strain may be engineered to produce a variety of chemicals from methanol, expanding the substrate range of E. coli in industrial microbiology. Moreover, the methanol condensation cycle (MCC) ( Bogorad et al., 2014 8. Bogorad, I.W. ∙ Chen, C.-T. ∙ Theisen, M.K. ... Building carbon-carbon bonds using a biocatalytic methanol condensation cycle Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :15928-15933 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) can be implemented to avoid carbon loss when producing acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-derived compounds, such as ethanol and higher alcohols. Additionally, successful expression of methane monooxygenases (MMOs) may further extend the substrate range to methane as the sole carbon source. Because of its genetic tractability, the synthetic methylotrophic E. coli presented here opens many possibilities for further scientific studies as well as engineering applications for production of chemicals from C1 compounds.

We used E. coli K-12 BW25113 as the experimental model in this study.
All strains were grown in at 37°C 250 rpm in a New Brunswick Scientific Innova 44, unless specified otherwise. LB (Becton Dickinson) was used for cloning purposes and the priority media when rich media was required. Antibiotics were used when required, at a final concentration of 100 mg/L for carbenicillin, 30 mg/L for kanamycin, 50 mg/L for chloramphenicol, or 250 mg/L for spectinomycin. Hi Def azure medium (abbreviated as HDA, Teknova) was used as a preliminary-stage medium for adaptive evolution with limited nutrients. MOPS EZ buffer (Teknova) was modified and utilized as a minimal medium (abbreviated as MOPS-EZ), which consisted of 40 mM MOPS, 50 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH 4 Cl, 0.525 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM tricine, 1.32 mM K 2 PO 4 , 0.276 mM K 2 SO 4 , 0.01 mM FeSO 4 , 0.5 μM CaCl 2 , 40 nM H 3 BO 3 , 8.08 nM MnCl 2 , 3.02 nM CoCl 2 , 0.962 nM CuSO 4 , 0.974 nM ZnSO 4 , and 0.292 nM (NH 4 ) 2 MoO 4 . OD 600 was monitored by a G30 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).
Strains used in this study are summarized in Table S2 . The initial auxotrophy strain, CFC381.0 was constructed from a ΔrpiA strain included in Keio collection ( Baba et al., 2006 1. Baba, T. ∙ Ara, T. ∙ Hasegawa, M. ... Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2 :2006.0008 Crossref Scopus (5912) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by kanamycin cassette removal with a pCP20 plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase ( Cherepanov and Wackernagel, 1995 11. Cherepanov, P.P. ∙ Wackernagel, W. Gene disruption in Escherichia coli : TcR and KmR cassettes with the option of Flp-catalyzed excision of the antibiotic-resistance determinant Gene. 1995; 158 :9-14 Crossref Scopus (1499) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, rpiB removal and insertion of two operons, P L lacO 1 :: medh-hps(Mb)-phi in the SS3 site (between ompW and yciE ) ( Bassalo et al., 2016 3. Bassalo, M.C. ∙ Garst, A.D. ∙ Halweg-Edwards, A.L. ... Rapid and Efficient One-Step Metabolic Pathway Integration in E. coli ACS Synth. Biol. 2016; 5 :561-568 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), and P L lacO 1 :: medh-tkt(Mb)-tal(Kp)-hps(Mb)-phi in the nupG site, were performed by a modified Crispr/Cas9 system from Jiang et al. (2015) 19. Jiang, Y. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Duan, C. ... Multigene editing in the Escherichia coli genome via the CRISPR-Cas9 system Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2015; 81 :2506-2514 Crossref Scopus (894) PubMed Google Scholar . The operons were integrated in SS3 and nupG respectively. pCas9-transformed strains were grown overnight, and reinoculated with an initial OD = 0.1 and grown for 4 hours in a 30°C shaker with LB and 100mM arabinose. The strains are then electroporated with the pTarget plasmid and plated on a LB plate at 30°C overnight. Successful gene editing targets were confirmed with colony PCR. The pTarget plasmid was then removed by growing cell on LB with 0.1mM IPTG, while the pCas9 was almost ultimately removed by growing the variant in LB 37°C and extensive screening. Methanol auxotrophy was evolved similarly as in previous studies ( Chen et al., 2018 10. Chen, C.-T. ∙ Chen, F.Y.-H. ∙ Bogorad, I.W. ... Synthetic methanol auxotrophy of Escherichia coli for methanol-dependent growth and production Metab. Eng. 2018; 49 :257-266 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). All E. coli strains were grown in a 3ml PP tube with the cap sealed to prevent evaporation and transferred to the next passage when OD 600 exceeded 1.2, or reached a stationary phase. Strains are typically inoculated at an initial OD 600 at 0.05 to 0.2. Accordingly, the population size at the bottleneck between transfers are approximately 1.5∼6x10 8 cells. Thus, effectively 3∼4 generations elapsed per passage.
The unevolved ΔrpiAB strain CFC381 was first inoculated in Terrific Broth (TB, Sigma) with 20 mM ribose and 20 mM xylose. Strains grew to saturation in two days and were then passed to HDA and MOPS separately, both with 400 mM MeOH and 20 mM xylose induced by 1 mM IPTG (media named as HMX and MMX, respectively). From Passage 2 to Passage 10, cells were passed from HMX to HMX. Beginning from Passage 11, cells were passed into MMX up until Passage 21 (CFC381.20), where the strain was subjected to further gene modifications after incorporating results suggested from theoretical calculations (See Robustness of RuMP-EMP-TCA cycle by EMRA in the Method Details section).
After methanol auxotroph was achieved from adaptive evolution, further knockout of pfkA and replacement of gapA with gapC were implemented by Crispr/Cas9 considering EMRA results. The Crispr protocol is identical to the one in the previous section. A plasmid pFC139 consisting rpiA with an RBS library was transformed into the strain by electroporation. Adaptive evolution was carried out by mixing a ratio of HDA and MOPS-EZ with 400 mM of MeOH. In addition, a vitamin mix was added regardless of the ratio of MOPS-EZ and HDA medium, where the following final concentration is reached: 40.94 μM nicotinamide, 14.82 μM thiamine hydrochloride, 13.29 μM riboflavin, 10.49 μM calcium pantothenate, 8.19 μM biotin, 4.53 μM folic acid, 0.07 μM vitamin B12. Moreover, 10 mM of NaNO 3 was incorporated and 1 mM of IPTG was used for induction at the point of inoculation. The evolution began with 100:0 of the HDA: MOPS-EZ media (After adding MeOH and all supplement vitamins, the actual ratio of HDA medium was diluted to 95.2%). At passage 2 (CFC526.2), HDA: MOPS-EZ was adjusted to 50%. From passage 3 (CFC526.3) to passage 16 (CFC526.16), HDA was reduced to 30% HDA ratio was further reduced to 20% and 10% from passage 17 (CFC526.17) to 19 (CFC526.19), and passage 19 (CFC526.19) to 20 (CFC526.20), respectively. Finally, HDA was completely eliminated where MOPS-EZ, vitamin mix, nitrate, IPTG, and MeOH were the only components in Passage 21, which was renamed to CFC 680.1. CFC680.1 was then further evolved on solely MOPS-EZ, vitamin mix, nitrate, IPTG and MeOH for 31 passages until CFC680.31. CFC688.2 was simultaneously grown from CFC680.1 with MOPS-EZ,vitamin mix, IPTG and MeOH without nitrate, and then evolved for 30 passages until CFC 688.32. Last but not least, at CFC526.20, a slower HDA reduction approach was employed. Specifically, 10% and 5% HDA supplement was provided until passage 21 (CFC526.21) and passage 22 (CFC526.22) respectively. HDA was completely omitted at passage 23 (CFC526.23). CFC526.23 was then evolved for 30 passages until CFC526.53.
A final single colony of strain SM1 was obtained by first streaking out CFC526.53 on a MOPS-EZ plus vitamin mix with 10 mM of NaNO 3 and 1 mM of IPTG plus 400 mM MeOH agar plate. The single colony was then inoculated into MOPS plus 400 mM MeOH liquid culture again, followed by streaking out on a LB plate in anaerobic conditions. The SM1 was finally retrieved by growing single colonies in LB with colony-PCR confirmation. The other single colony strain BB1 was simply isolated by growing CFC526.53 in LB liquid and LB plate.
The final SM1 strain is grown in the 1x MOPS EZ media (10X stock from Catalog No. M2101, Teknova) along with 400mM MeOH, the previously mentioned vitamin mix, 1mM IPTG and 50mg/L chloramphenicol. Note that the chloramphenicol was dissolved in pure methanol as well, and was added to the media by a 1000x stock. This medium is defined as the "MM medium" throughout the article.
All plasmids that were implemented in this study are summarized in the Key Resources Table. All of the plasmids were constructed by Gibson Assembly with the NEBuilder kit (New England Biolabs) while DNA fragments were amplified by KODone (Toyobo). E. coli DH5alpha was used as the cloning host.
EMRA is a calculation method developed to determine the likelihood of perturbations in enzyme expression and kinetics that causes instability of the steady state ( Lee et al., 2014 23. Lee, Y. ∙ Lafontaine Rivera, J.G. ∙ Liao, J.C. Ensemble Modeling for Robustness Analysis in engineering non-native metabolic pathways Metab. Eng. 2014; 25 :63-71 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rivera et al., 2015 31. Rivera, J.G.L. ∙ Lee, Y. ∙ Liao, J.C. An entropy-like index of bifurcational robustness for metabolic systems Integr. Biol. (Camb.). 2015; 7 :1-9 Google Scholar ). After pre-setting a reference steady state for the entire pathway, a total of 100 parameter sets were then generated and perturbed randomly from 0.1-fold to 10-fold for each enzyme. Results were reported as an indication of the robustness of the system, where Y R,M refers to the ratio of the 100 parameter sets that are robust at each point.
Qualitative analysis of 13 C labeled acetate and formate was conducted by an Agilent Technologies 7890 gas chromatography along with a 5977B mass spectrometer. Samples were prepared by aliquoting the supernatant of the culture after centrifugation at 15000rpm for 3 minutes. 0.5 μL of sample was injected into the GC. A DB-FFAP column (Agilent Technologies, 0.32 mm × 30 m × 0.25 μm) was utilized along with constant pressure of 7.0633 psi helium gas supply. The thermal cycle was carried out with an initial temperature of 40°C for 2 minutes, followed by a ramp rate of 10°C/min to 60°C and 100°C/min to 240°C along with a final 2-minute hold.
The cell viability assay was done by using LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Thermofisher Scientific, USA) following its protocol. The fluorescence of cells was then detected by a 2018 Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermofisher Scientific, USA). The Blue laser (Excitation Wavelength 488nm) and BL1 filter (Emission filter 530 ± 30nm) was selected for SYTO-9 detection, while the yellow laser (Excitation Wavelength 561nm) and YL2 filter (Emission filter 620 ± 15nm) was used for propidium iodide detection.
The extraction protocol was modified from that reported by Qin and Wang (2009) 30. Qin, H. ∙ Wang, Y. Exploring DNA-binding proteins with in vivo chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8 :1983-1991 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar and Barker et al. (2005) 2. Barker, S. ∙ Murray, D. ∙ Zheng, J. ... A method for the isolation of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks suitable for proteomics analysis Anal. Biochem. 2005; 344 :204-215 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar . 2 mL of E. coli (CFC526.41 and CFC680.24) was first pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 minutes, and then resuspended in 100 μL of 10 mM MOPS buffer containing 2.0 mg/ml of lysozyme, with incubation of 30 minutes at 37°C. 500 μL of DNAzol reagent was then added and mixed for 5 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was then transferred into a new tube where 300 μL ice cold 100% ethanol was added for DNA precipitation. Samples were then stored at −80°C for at least 1 hour. Subsequently, after removal of supernatant by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 minutes, the DNA pellet was re-dissolved in 190 μL of 8 mM NaOH. Subsequently, 10 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 was added while urea and SDS were added as well to a final concentration of 8 M & 2% w/v respectively for protein denaturing and disassociation of non-specific binding protein to DNA. The entire mixture was gently shaken at 37°C for 30 minutes. Protein was then salted out by adding equal volume of 5 M NaCl and subjected to gentle shaking at 37°C for 30 minutes. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm, 20 minutes, the supernatant was transferred to an Amicon Ultra-4 mL Centrifugal Filters with a 3 kDa cutoff (Millipore) and washed with 10 mM of Tris pH 7.4 thrice to a final dilution factor of 10000. When the volume was finally concentrated to 450 μl, 50 μL of 3 M potassium acetate and 1 mL of ice-cold 100% ethanol were added and stored once again at −80°C for 1 hour. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4°C, the DNA pellet was retained and washed with 1 mL 70% ethanol. The pellet was then dissolved with 10 mM Tris-HCl, typically 100 μl. The DNA was then quantified by 260 nm Nanodrop (Thermo).
Purified DPC complex at a scale around 500 ng of DNA was mounted on an activated 300-mesh copper grid coated with carbon-stabilized formvar (Ted Pella) for 1 minute at room temperature. Following liquid removal by filter paper blotting, samples were stained with 2.5% uranyl acetate for 1 minute. After excess stain removal, the samples were air-dried at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy was performed with a Tecnai G2 Spirit Bio TWIN (FEI Co.), while images were recorded with a K3 Base IS CCD camera (Gatan) at a magnifying ratio of 2700x to 15000x.
Decrosslinking of the DNA was done by incubation at 70°C for 1 hour, followed by a DNAase I (NEB) and S1 nuclease (Thermo) treatment, 1 μL each. The small digested DNA fragment was then removed by using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL Centrifugal Filters with a 3 kDa cutoff and the final volume was reduced to 50 μl. Sample concentration was then estimated by 280 nm Nanodrop. SDS-PAGE was run for quick analysis with a 12% precast gel (Biorad), while staining was done with a Pierce silver staining kit (Thermo Scientific).
Proteomics sample preparation and analysis were performed by the Academia Sinica Common Mass Spectrometry Facilities. Poteins were denatured by adding urea to a final concentration of 4 M, followed by reduction with 10 mM dithioerythritol at 37°C for 45 minutes, and cysteines alkylation with 25 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 1 hour. Protein samples were digested overnight at 37°C using LysC protease and trypsin at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). After tryptic digestion, the peptides were desalted directly by C18 StageTip. Samples were performed on EASY-nLC™ 1200 system connected to a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Data analysis was performed using SEQUEST HT algorithm integrated in the Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Finnigan). MS/MS scans were matched against an E. coli K12 database (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 2019_10 Release).
The data was analyzed by first normalizing the abundance of the internal standard DNase to the same value within different time points of the same sample. Then the normalized abundance of each sample was divided by their DNA concentration. Last, the heatmap was plotted by listing out the top 100 hits of ranked by protein abundance and taking the common hits to visualize in a log scale, with descending order based on average abundance of the final time point of individual samples.
Genomic DNA was purified by QIAGEN Puregene kit (QIAGEN). All strains that were sequenced are summarized in Table S2 . Sample quality control, library preparation, and sequencing of Illumina and Pacbio were done in Academia Sinica NGS High Throughput Genomics Core. Samples that are collected throughout the adaptive evolution were sequenced by either Illumina Miseq or Illumina Hiseq Rapid (Illumina), with a 2 × 150 bp pair-end format. Samples that were in the middle of adaptive evolution were all ensured to have a coverage of at least 60 to differentiate sequencing error from SNPs. Data was then processed by Geneious 11 software (Geneious), by trimming with BBduk and then mapped to a reference by the software’s native mapper. SNP variants were called by setting the criteria to a frequency of 25%.
The final stain was then sequenced by Pacbio Sequel (Pacific Biosciences) and Nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). For Pacbio Sequel, a 25kb SMRTbell library (Pacific Biosciences) was prepared and its quality was assessed by fragment analyzer (Agilent). The library was then run in a CLR 20-hr diffusion mode. The reads were assembled by HGAP4.
Nanopore sample preparation and sequencing were conducted by Health GeneTech Corp., Taiwan.
Digital PCR experiments were conducted by the Academia Sinica Genomic Technology Core. CNVs were detected by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) with the QX200TM ddPCR system (Bio-Rad). Genomic DNA was first extracted as done in the NGS experiment. 0.5 μg of DNA was then digested with HindIII for 1 hour. The PCR reaction was carried out by a “ddPCR Supermix for Probes” kit (Bio-rad) after loading 25pg of the digested DNA. Data was analyzed by QuantaSoft Analysis Pro Software.
SM1 was streaked out on a LB plate, where a single colony was picked and inoculated in LB. The LB culture was then passed to LB culture 3 more times, followed by a MM culture inoculation. The MM culture was then streaked out onto LB plates twice, where 7 colonies were then inoculated into LB once again. Data shown in this manuscript starts from this point. The strain was then passed into LB for 7 times. The 1st, 4th and 7th pass (annotated as “Pas1,” “Pas4,” “Pas7” culture were passed into MM culture to test methanol growth. The genomic DNA of the LB culture and the subsequent MM culture were extracted by the QIAGEN Puregene kit, where the copy number were tested by digital PCR.
E. coli total RNA was prepared using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) and reverse transcribed by QuantiNova reverse transcription kit (QIAGEN). Detection of cDNA levels were performed using CFX Connect Real-Time PCR detection system (BioRad Laboratories). All samples were measured in triplicate in hard-shell 96-well PCR plate using QuantiNova SYBR green RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN). The expression fold change was analyzed by ΔΔCt values normalized to E. coli 16S rRNA. The overexpressed heterologous genes were categorized in formaldehyde consuming and producing gene dataset. The datasets were first tested by a Shapiro-Wilk test to test the data is normally distributed, which was the case. A two-tailed F-test was then done to evaluate whether a t test with equal or unequal variance should be used. Finally, the t test was done to evaluate if the fold changes of formaldehyde consuming and producing genes are statistically different from each other.
E. coli total RNA was extracted by RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). rRNA was prepped by Ribo-Zero (Bacteria) kit. Data was then processed by CLC genomics workbench 20. The TPM were calculated, and the following metabolic pathway includes the following gene when calculating the TPM distribution: TCA includes aspA , fdrA , fdrB , fumA , fumB , fumC , gltA , icd , mdh , mqo , ppc , prpC , prpD , sdhA , sdhB , sdhC , sdhD , sucA , sucB , sucC , sucD , yahF and ybhJ; EMP (Glycolysis) includes: aceE , aceF , cra , eno , fbaA , fbaB , gpmA , gpmM, lpd , pfkB , pgj , pykA , pykF , tpiA and gapC; ED includes : pgi , zwf , pgl , edd and eda; RuMP includes : medh, hps, phi, tal, tkt, rpe, rpiA. The TPM sets sorted by metabolic pathway were evaluated if they are statistically different from others by the methodology mentioned in the qRT-PCR section.
Native operons of pfkA , frmA , gapA were cloned into BAC (bacteria artificial chromosome) with an AmpR selection marker and transformed back to SM1 strain. SM1 strains re-expressing pfkA , frmA , gapA or both pfkA and gapA were then re-inoculated into 400 mM methanol medium. Growth curves were recorded and compared with SM1 strain transformed with an empty BAC.
Samples were prepared by aliquoting the supernatant of the culture after centrifugation at 15000rpm for 3 minutes and then filtered through a 0.22 filter (Milipore). Methanol concentration was determined by an Agilent Technologies 7890 gas chromatography with a flame-ionization-detector. Nitrogen gas with constant pressure of 19.082psi was flowed through a DB-624UI column (Agilent Technologies, 0.32 mm × 30 m × 0.25 μm) a thermal cycle consisting of the following stages: initial 45°C for 1 minute, ramp rate of 20°C/min to 150°C, and 45°C/min to 240°C with a final 1-minute hold.
The fermentation products, namely acetate and formate, were measured by an Agilent 1290 UPLC using an Hi-plex H column (Agilent Technologies, 300x6.5 mm). A run was done with the mobile phase consisting 30 mM sulfuric acid with a flow rate of 0.6mL/min for 30 minutes.
