Title: Commensal Microbiota Modulation of Natural Resistance to Virus Infection


Abstract: Summary

Interferon (IFN)-Is are crucial mediators of antiviral immunity and homeostatic immune system regulation. However, the source of IFN-I signaling under homeostatic conditions is unclear. We discovered that commensal microbes regulate the IFN-I response through induction of IFN-β by colonic DCs. Moreover, the mechanism by which a specific commensal microbe induces IFN-β was identified. Outer membrane (OM)-associated glycolipids of gut commensal microbes belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum induce expression of IFN-β. Using Bacteroides fragilis and its OM-associated polysaccharide A, we determined that IFN-β expression was induced via TLR4-TRIF signaling. Antiviral activity of this purified microbial molecule against infection with either vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or influenza was demonstrated to be dependent on the induction of IFN-β. In a murine VSV infection model, commensal-induced IFN-β regulated natural resistance to virus infection. Due to the physiological importance of IFN-Is, discovery of an IFN-β-inducing microbial molecule represents a potential approach for the treatment of some human diseases.

Section: Introduction

The human body is colonized by trillions of microbial organisms collectively referred to as the commensal microbiota ( Erturk-Hasdemir and Kasper, 2013 9. Erturk-Hasdemir, D. ∙ Kasper, D.L. Resident commensals shaping immunity Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2013; 25 :450-455 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012 16. Human Microbiome Project Consortium Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome Nature. 2012; 486 :207-214 Crossref Scopus (8285) PubMed Google Scholar ). With advances in culture-independent DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, there has been a rapid increase in our knowledge of the diversity and dynamics of the microbiota over the past two decades ( Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012 16.

Current estimates suggest that there are roughly as many bacterial cells as human cells in the body, the vast majority of which reside in the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is colonized by an estimated 10 14 bacteria ( Qin et al., 2010 35.

Turnbaugh, P.J. ∙ Ley, R.E. ∙ Hamady, M. ... The human microbiome project Nature. 2007; 449 :804-810 Crossref Scopus (4237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite these advances, relatively little is understood about the molecular mechanisms by which specific commensal microbes interact with their mammalian host. A growing body of research has revealed that commensal microbes are not just passive residents, but they play an important role in modulating vital host physiological systems, both locally and systemically ( Lin et al., 2014 22. Lin, C.S. ∙ Chang, C.J. ∙ Lu, C.C. ... Impact of the gut microbiota, prebiotics, and probiotics on human health and disease Biomed. J. 2014; 37 :259-268 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Surana and Kasper, 2014 51. Surana, N.K. ∙ Kasper, D.L. Deciphering the tête-à-tête between the microbiota and the immune system J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124 :4197-4203 PubMed Google Scholar ). Understanding how microbes interact with their host is therefore not only biologically interesting, but it provides a platform for discovering potential therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases.
One mechanism by which microbes can modulate the host immune system is through regulation of cytokine signaling. Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are a family of structurally similar cytokines, consisting primarily of two different classes of proteins, interferon-α (IFN-α) and interferon-β (IFN-β), all of which signal through the common type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) ( Theofilopoulos et al., 2005 53. Theofilopoulos, A.N. ∙ Baccala, R. ∙ Beutler, B. ... Type I interferons (alpha/beta) in immunity and autoimmunity Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23 :307-336 Crossref Scopus (1054) PubMed Google Scholar ). IFN-I expression is regulated at the transcriptional level and can be induced at high levels in all nucleated cells in response to sensing of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) ( Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014 17. Ivashkiv, L.B. ∙ Donlin, L.T. Regulation of type I interferon responses Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :36-49 Crossref Scopus (2232) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, IFN-Is play a critical role in the response to the majority of virus infections through induction of a restrictive anti-viral state in cells, induction of apoptosis in infected cells, and regulation of immune cell subsets crucial to the antiviral response ( McNab et al., 2015 31.

Intrinsic antiviral immunity Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :214-222 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several recent studies have demonstrated that IFN-Is are not just present during infection, but are expressed constitutively at low levels and possess vital homeostatic functions ( Gough et al., 2012 14. Gough, D.J. ∙ Messina, N.L. ∙ Clarke, C.J. ...

Microbiota-Induced Type I Interferons Instruct a Poised Basal State of Dendritic Cells Cell. 2020; 181 :1080-1096 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, IFN-Is have the capacity to regulate the development or function of virtually every immune effector cell, contributing to the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor responses ( Gough et al., 2012 14. Gough, D.J. ∙ Messina, N.L. ∙ Clarke, C.J. ... Constitutive type I interferon modulates homeostatic balance through tonic signaling Immunity. 2012; 36 :166-174 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite this importance, the mechanism by which IFN-Is are induced and regulated in the absence of infection has yet to be elucidated.
Due to the importance of IFN-Is to the health of the organism, it is of critical importance to gain a mechanistic understanding of how the constitutive IFN-I response is regulated in healthy individuals and might be disrupted leading to disease. We hypothesized that the commensal microbiota supplies PRR signaling to regulate the IFN-I response in the absence of infection. In this study, we discovered that the commensal microbiota regulates the IFN-I response both locally and systemically through induction of IFN-β by colonic lamina propria (LP) dendritic cells (DCs), enhancing resistance to virus infection. Moreover, the molecular mechanism by which a specific commensal microbe induces IFN-β was identified. Indeed, we found that outer membrane-associated glycolipids of human gut commensal microbes belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum induce expression of IFN-β. Using Bacteroides fragilis ( B. fragilis ) as the paradigm, we determined that signaling to initiate IFN-β expression was through the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF) pathway.

Section: Results

To investigate the role of the commensal microbiota in the host IFN-I response, the effect of microbiota depletion on downstream interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression in various murine tissues was analyzed. The vast majority of commensal microbes reside in the GI tract ( Savage, 1977 39. Savage, D.C. Microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31 :107-133 Crossref Scopus (1760) PubMed Google Scholar ; Turnbaugh et al., 2007 54. Turnbaugh, P.J. ∙ Ley, R.E. ∙ Hamady, M. ... The human microbiome project Nature. 2007; 449 :804-810 Crossref Scopus (4237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis was therefore performed to determine effects of the microbiota on ISG expression in the intestinal immune compartment, in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN), and systemically, in the spleen. Age- and gender-matched wild-type (WT) specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice were administered either vehicle control or a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) in the drinking water for 7 days to deplete the microbiota. The relative expression levels of a panel of ISGs were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A reduction in ISG expression was observed in both the mLN and spleen of WT ABX mice compared to WT SPF mice ( Figures 1 A–1D; Tables S1 and S2 ), demonstrating a role for microbiota regulation of the IFN-I response both locally and systemically.
Due to the potential for off-target effects of antibiotics, a second method of microbiota depletion was used to confirm a direct role of the commensal microbiota on the observed phenotype ( Morgun et al., 2015 33. Morgun, A. ∙ Dzutsev, A. ∙ Dong, X. ... Uncovering effects of antibiotics on the host and microbiota using transkingdom gene networks Gut. 2015; 64 :1732-1743 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ). Splenic and mLN ISG expression was analyzed in WT C57BL/6 germ-free (GF) mice devoid of all microbes compared to WT C57BL/6 SPF mice. Consistent with the ABX mice, a reduction in mLN and splenic ISG expression was observed ( Figures S1 A and S1B; Tables S1 and S2 ).
Of the mammalian IFN-Is, IFN-β is unique with respect to its homeostatic functions and expression pattern ( Schreiber and Piehler, 2015 42. Schreiber, G. ∙ Piehler, J. The molecular basis for functional plasticity in type I interferon signaling Trends Immunol. 2015; 36 :139-149 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was therefore hypothesized that the commensal microbiota induces the constitutive IFN-I response, as evidenced by ISG expression, specifically through regulation of IFN-β. ISG expression levels were compared by qRT-PCR between WT and IFN-β-deficient ( Ifnb1 −/− ) SPF mice. A significant reduction in ISG expression was observed in the mLN and spleen of Ifnb1 −/− mice compared to WT mice ( Figures 1 A–1D; Tables S1 and S2 ), confirming a role for IFN-β in the homeostatic IFN-I response. Interestingly, the magnitude of reduction was comparable to that observed upon microbiota depletion, with no significant difference between WT ABX and Ifnb1 −/− SPF expression levels. To further test whether commensal-induced IFN-β is required for ISG expression, the microbiota of Ifnb1 −/− mice was depleted by ABX administration. ABX treatment had no additional effect on mLN or splenic ISG expression in Ifnb1 −/− mice ( Figures 1 A–1D; Tables S1 and S2 ), demonstrating that commensal microbes regulate the IFN-I response specifically through IFN-β.
To investigate the source of commensal-induced IFN-β under homeostatic conditions, flow cytometric analysis was performed on tissues harvested from IFN-β-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter mice, in which cells activated to express IFN-β express YFP ( Scheu et al., 2008 41. Scheu, S. ∙ Dresing, P. ∙ Locksley, R.M. Visualization of IFNbeta production by plasmacytoid versus conventional dendritic cells under specific stimulation conditions in vivo Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :20416-20421 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). By analyzing IFN-β-YFP expression in the colon LP, mLN, and spleen, IFN-β expression was found to be localized to the intestinal milieu, with significantly higher percentages of IFN-β-YFP + CD45 + leukocytes in the colon LP compared to the spleen or mLN ( Figures 2 A and S2 ). The colon was chosen as a representative region of the GI tract because it is home to the greatest percentage of commensal organisms, both in terms of number and abundance ( Turnbaugh et al., 2007 54. Turnbaugh, P.J. ∙ Ley, R.E. ∙ Hamady, M. ... The human microbiome project Nature. 2007; 449 :804-810 Crossref Scopus (4237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Having identified the location of IFN-β expression, the cellular source of this cytokine was next investigated. Due to their role as sentinel cells in the immune system, DCs were hypothesized to be the main source of IFN-β under homeostatic conditions. It was found that out of the IFN-β-YFP + CD45 + cells in the colonic LP, the majority (∼74%) expressed CD11c, a molecule expressed on the surface of DCs and commonly used as a DC marker ( Figure 2 B) ( Singh-Jasuja et al., 2013 47. Singh-Jasuja, H. ∙ Thiolat, A. ∙ Ribon, M. ... The mouse dendritic cell marker CD11c is down-regulated upon cell activation through Toll-like receptor triggering Immunobiology. 2013; 218 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings demonstrate that colon LP DCs are a major source of IFN-β under homeostatic conditions.
As in other tissues, conventional DCs (cDCs) in the colon LP represent a heterogeneous population that can be classified into two subsets based on surface marker expression. cDC 1 cells are CD103 + CD11b − , whereas cDC 2 cells comprise both CD103 − CD11b + and CD103 + CD11b + cells ( Stagg, 2018 49. Stagg, A.J. Intestinal Dendritic Cells in Health and Gut Inflammation Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :2883 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine which DCs express IFN-β, expression of CD103 and CD11b by the IFN-β-YFP + CD11c + CD45 + colonic dendritic cells was analyzed using flow cytometry. IFN-β expression was specific to the cDC 2 subset of cells, including both CD103 + CD11b + and CD103 − CD11b + cells ( Figure 2 C).
To confirm these findings, a second experimental approach was used in which DCs were isolated from the colon LP, mLN, and spleens of WT SPF mice using a magnetic bead-based cell separation method. Expression of Ifnb1 was analyzed in the whole tissue single-cell suspension as well as both the DC + and DC − fractions of these tissues by qRT-PCR. There was no detectable Ifnb1 expression in the whole tissue or the DC − fraction of the majority of colon LP samples ( Figure 2 D) or in the mLN ( Figure S3 A) and spleen ( Figure S3 B). However, DCs in both the colon LP ( Figures 2 D and 2E) and the mLN ( Figures 2 E and S3 A), but not the spleen ( Figures 2 F and S3 B), expressed Ifnb1. Interestingly, DC expression of Ifnb1 is significantly higher in the colon LP than in the mLN ( Figure 2 E). These findings confirm that IFN-β is predominantly expressed by colon LP DCs.
To test the role of the microbiota in colonic DC IFN-β expression, two methods of microbiota depletion were employed. ABX were administered in the drinking water of IFN-β-YFP mice for 7 days, followed by flow cytometric analysis of colon LP cells. A significant reduction in the frequency of IFNβ-YFP + CD11c + cells was observed in IFN-β-YFP mice after ABX treatment ( Figure 2 F). In addition, Ifnb1 transcript levels in colon LP DCs of WT GF mice were analyzed by qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in Ifnb1 expression in WT GF mice compared to WT SPF mice was observed ( Figure 2 G). These results confirm that the microbiota induces IFN-β expression by colon LP DCs
Having identified effects of commensal-induced IFN-β on ISG expression both locally and systemically, we investigated IFN-β levels in systemic circulation, through measurement of serum IFN-β levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Consistent with reports that IFN-I expression is extremely low under homeostatic conditions, we were unable to detect IFN-β in the serum of WT SPF or ABX mice ( Figure S3 C).
Of the trillions of commensal bacteria that inhabit the mammalian gut, one of the most prominent phyla represented is the Bacteroidetes , consisting of obligate anaerobic, Gram-negative rods. An estimated 25% of all colonic anaerobes belong to the genus Bacteroides within this phylum ( Salyers, 1984 38. Salyers, A.A. Bacteroides of the human lower intestinal tract Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38 :293-313 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wexler, 2007 59. Wexler, H.M. Bacteroides: the good, the bad, and the nitty-gritty Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2007; 20 :593-621 Crossref Scopus (1491) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently an association was reported between several species of the genus Bacteroides , pDC numbers, and an IFN-I response gene signature ( Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017 12. Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Kua, L. ... Mining the Human Gut Microbiota for Immunomodulatory Organisms Cell. 2017; 168 :928-943 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). One of the Bacteroides sp. investigated in this study was B. fragilis, a common human colonic commensal bacterial species with previously demonstrated immunomodulatory properties ( An et al., 2014 2.

Mazmanian, S.K. ∙ Round, J.L. ∙ Kasper, D.L. A microbial symbiosis factor prevents intestinal inflammatory disease Nature. 2008; 453 :620-625 Crossref Scopus (1869) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to its demonstrated ability to influence the immune system, as well as the association with pDCs and IFN-I, we hypothesized that B. fragilis regulates colonic DC IFN-β expression and thus regulates the IFN-I response.
GF mice were colonized with B. fragilis strain NCTC 9343 at 4 weeks of age, followed by isolation of colon LP DCs after 2 weeks and analysis of Ifnb1 expression. As a colonization control, GF mice were colonized with a different bacterial species with demonstrated immunomodulatory properties, Clostridium ramosum ( C. ramosum ), thus controlling for any non-specific effects due to bacterial colonization ( Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017 12. Geva-Zatorsky, N. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Kua, L. ... Mining the Human Gut Microbiota for Immunomodulatory Organisms Cell. 2017; 168 :928-943 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sefik et al., 2015 43.

Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ + regulatory T cells Science. 2015; 349 :993-997 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ). Colonization with B. fragilis significantly enhanced Ifnb1 expression in colon LP DCs, whereas C. ramosum colonization had no effect ( Figure 3 A). Although B. fragilis predominantly colonizes the lower intestinal tract, it is possible that it might also regulate Ifnb1 expression in other parts of the intestine. We therefore also examined Ifnb1 expression by DCs isolated from the small intestine (SI) LP of B. fragilis monocolonized mice. In contrast to the colon, colonization with B. fragilis had no observable effect on SI LP DC Ifnb1 expression ( Figure S4 ), demonstrating that regulation of DC IFN-β by this commensal organism is location specific.
The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria serves as the site of interaction between the bacterial cell and its environment and comprises several classes of potential immunomodulatory molecules ( Kasper and Seiler, 1975 19. Kasper, D.L. ∙ Seiler, M.W. Immunochemical characterization of the outer membrane complex of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis J. Infect. Dis. 1975; 132 :440-450 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; May and Grabowicz, 2018 28. May, K.L. ∙ Grabowicz, M. The bacterial outer membrane is an evolving antibiotic barrier Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :8852-8854 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether an OM component is responsible for IFN-β expression, an in vitro model was developed in which bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) isolated from WT mice were treated with OM complexes isolated from B. fragilis , followed by ELISA analysis of secreted IFN-β in the supernatants. B. fragilis OM complexes significantly induced IFN-β secretion by BMDCs ( Figure 3 B). Capsular polysaccharides can be attached to the OM through covalent linkage to lipid anchors, which are inserted into the OM lipid bilayer ( Cress et al., 2014 4. Cress, B.F. ∙ Englaender, J.A. ∙ He, W. ... Masquerading microbial pathogens: capsular polysaccharides mimic host-tissue molecules FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38 :660-697 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). One capsular polysaccharide of B. fragilis , polysaccharide A (PSA) has been demonstrated to have immunomodulatory properties ( Dasgupta et al., 2014 7. Dasgupta, S. ∙ Erturk-Hasdemir, D. ∙ Ochoa-Reparaz, J. ... Plasmacytoid dendritic cells mediate anti-inflammatory responses to a gut commensal molecule via both innate and adaptive mechanisms Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 15 :413-423 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mazmanian et al., 2005 29. Mazmanian, S.K. ∙ Liu, C.H. ∙ Tzianabos, A.O. ... An immunomodulatory molecule of symbiotic bacteria directs maturation of the host immune system Cell. 2005; 122 :107-118 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2250) PubMed Google Scholar , 2008 30. Mazmanian, S.K. ∙ Round, J.L. ∙ Kasper, D.L. A microbial symbiosis factor prevents intestinal inflammatory disease Nature. 2008; 453 :620-625 Crossref Scopus (1869) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether PSA is an IFN-β-inducing component of the B. fragilis OM, BMDCs were treated with purified PSA and secretion of IFN-β in the supernatants was analyzed by ELISA. Indeed, PSA significantly induced IFN-β secretion by BMDCs ( Figure 3 C).
To confirm the ability of PSA to induce a productive IFN-I response through IFN-β, expression of downstream ISGs was analyzed by qRT-PCR in BMDCS treated for 24 h with PSA or vehicle control. An increase in ISG expression was observed in WT BMDCs treated with PSA ( Figure 3 D). Expression levels of the surface-expressed ISG, bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), were determined by flow cytometric analysis of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and also found to be increased in PSA-treated compared to vehicle control WT BMDCs ( Figure 3 E). Surface BST2 levels after PSA treatment were significantly reduced in IFNAR1-deficient ( Ifnar1 −/− ) and Ifnb1 −/− BMDCs, confirming that signaling of IFN-β through IFNAR1 is necessary for the observed increase in levels of a representative ISG by PSA. Together, these data demonstrate that PSA induces secretion of IFN-β and downstream ISG expression in vitro by BMDCs.
To confirm the relevance of these findings in vivo , Ifnb1 expression by colon LP DCs was analyzed in WT SPF mice administered 150 μg of PSA by oral gavage. A significant increase in Ifnb1 expression was observed 1.5 h after treatment ( Figure 3 F), suggesting that PSA is capable of signaling to colon LP DCs in vivo to induce Ifnb1 expression.
PSA has been previously demonstrated to signal via TLR2/1 heterodimers and dectin-1 on DCs to induce secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 by CD4 + T cells ( Dasgupta et al., 2014 7. Dasgupta, S. ∙ Erturk-Hasdemir, D. ∙ Ochoa-Reparaz, J. ...

Erturk-Hasdemir, D. ∙ Oh, S.F. ∙ Okan, N.A. ... Symbionts exploit complex signaling to educate the immune system Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :26157-26166 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ; Round and Mazmanian, 2010 37. Round, J.L. ∙ Mazmanian, S.K. Inducible Foxp3+ regulatory T-cell development by a commensal bacterium of the intestinal microbiota Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :12204-12209 Crossref Scopus (1779) PubMed Google Scholar ). The role of TLR2 and dectin-1 in PSA induction of IFN-β was therefore investigated by comparing the response of WT, dectin-1 ( Clec7a −/− ), and TLR2 ( Tlr2 −/− )-deficient BMDCs to PSA using ELISA to detect IFN-β secreted in the supernatants. Much to our surprise, loss of dectin-1 or TLR2 had no effect on IFN-β secretion ( Figure 4 A), suggesting that PSA signals through a different and previously unidentified pathway to regulate IFN-β expression.
The majority of IFN-I inducing PRRs sense viral nucleic acid, with the bacteria-sensing TLR2, dectin-1, and TLR4 pathways representing some of the few exceptions. TLR4 senses microbial glycolipids, and of the IFN-Is, predominantly induces IFN-β, consistent with the signaling observed by PSA ( Lu et al., 2008 24. Lu, Y.C. ∙ Yeh, W.C. ∙ Ohashi, P.S. LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathway Cytokine. 2008; 42 :145-151 Crossref Scopus (2414) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sheikh et al., 2014 46. Sheikh, F. ∙ Dickensheets, H. ∙ Gamero, A.M. ... An essential role for IFN-β in the induction of IFN-stimulated gene expression by LPS in macrophages J. Leukoc. Biol. 2014; 96 :591-600 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). TLR4-deficient ( Tlr4 −/− ) BMDCs completely lost the ability to secrete IFN-β in response to PSA treatment ( Figure 4 A), confirming that PSA signals through TLR4 to induce IFN-β secretion.
TLR4 signaling proceeds through two different signaling adaptor molecules, myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88) and TRIF. MyD88 canonically activates the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) to induce proinflammatory gene expression, whereas TRIF activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to mediate IFN-β expression ( Maeshima and Fernandez, 2013 26. Maeshima, N. ∙ Fernandez, R.C. Recognition of lipid A variants by the TLR4-MD-2 receptor complex Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2013; 3 :3 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with these well-described signaling events, PSA induction of IFN-β was entirely dependent on TRIF, as evidenced by the lack of increased IFN-β secretion in TRIF-deficient ( Trif −/− ) BMDCs in response to PSA ( Figure 4 A). A significant decrease in IFN-β secretion was also observed in PSA-treated MyD88-deficient ( Myd88 −/− ) BMDCs ( Figure 4 A), potentially due to regulatory effects that MyD88 expression has on BMDC function.
The canonical TLR4 ligand is LPS, the primary component of the OMs of Gram-negative bacteria ( Maeshima and Fernandez, 2013 26. Maeshima, N. ∙ Fernandez, R.C. Recognition of lipid A variants by the TLR4-MD-2 receptor complex Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2013; 3 :3 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to the archetypal Gram-negative bacterial species Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), the OM of B. fragilis lacks LPS but instead consists of a lipooligosaccharide (LOS), comprising a lipid A domain linked to a short oligosaccharide ( Lindberg et al., 1990 23. Lindberg, A.A. ∙ Weintraub, A. ∙ Zähringer, U. ... Structure-activity relationships in lipopolysaccharides of Bacteroides fragilis Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12 :S133-S141 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recently identified that PSA contains a glycolipid portion, which structurally resembles B. fragilis LOS, and we now believe that the polysaccharide domain of PSA is covalently linked to LOS as a means of attachment to the OM ( Erturk-Hasdemir et al., 2019 10. Erturk-Hasdemir, D. ∙ Oh, S.F. ∙ Okan, N.A. ... Symbionts exploit complex signaling to educate the immune system Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :26157-26166 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lipid A component of the LOS of Bacteroides has structural and biological features that distinguish it from the much-studied lipid A of E. coli ( Erturk-Hasdemir et al., 2019 10. Erturk-Hasdemir, D. ∙ Oh, S.F. ∙ Okan, N.A. ... Symbionts exploit complex signaling to educate the immune system Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :26157-26166 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kasper, 1976 18. Kasper, D.L. Chemical and biological characterization of the lipopolysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis J. Infect. Dis. 1976; 134 :59-66 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was therefore hypothesized that the LOS portion of PSA is responsible for induction of IFN-β. Consistent with this hypothesis, purified B. fragilis LOS was observed to induce IFN-β in a dose-dependent manner through TLR4 ( Figures 4 B and 4C). In contrast, PSA that was delipidated using acid hydrolysis followed by chloroform/methanol extraction to remove the lipid induced no detectable levels of IFN-β ( Figure 4 B), confirming that the LOS domain of PSA is responsible for IFN-β signaling.
LOS-like molecules are not unique to B. fragilis , and multiple bacterial species of the genus Bacteroides have been demonstrated to have LPS or LOS molecules consisting of glycolipids that are structurally similar to B. fragilis LOS and distinct from classical E. coli LPS ( Cullen et al., 2015 5. Cullen, T.W. ∙ Schofield, W.B. ∙ Barry, N.A. ... Gut microbiota. Antimicrobial peptide resistance mediates resilience of prominent gut commensals during inflammation Science. 2015; 347 :170-175 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kasper, 1976 18. Kasper, D.L. Chemical and biological characterization of the lipopolysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis J. Infect. Dis. 1976; 134 :59-66 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vatanen et al., 2016 57. Vatanen, T. ∙ Kostic, A.D. ∙ d’Hennezel, E. ..., DIABIMMUNE Study Group Variation in Microbiome LPS Immunogenicity Contributes to Autoimmunity in Humans Cell. 2016; 165 :842-853 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (830) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore hypothesized that induction of IFN-β by Bacteroides LOS/LPS represents a broader mechanism by which commensal microbes are capable of influencing the host immune system. OM complexes were isolated from several different species of Bacteroides to test their effect on cytokine secretion by BMDCs. OMs extracted from all of the Bacteroides sp. tested induced IFN-β by BMDCs in a TLR4-dependent manner ( Figure 4 D), suggesting that the LPS/LOS species of each of these Bacteroides is indeed capable of signaling through TLR4 to induce IFN-β.
To address the role of Bacteroides sp. and TLR4 signaling in regulation of the IFN-I response in vivo , ISG expression was compared in WT SPF mice, Tlr4 −/− SPF mice, and WT SPF mice 7 days post treatment with metronidazole, a bactericidal antibiotic that specifically targets anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides sp. ( Edwards, 1979 8. Edwards, D.I. Mechanism of antimicrobial action of metronidazole J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1979; 5 :499-502 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ; Salyers, 1984 38. Salyers, A.A. Bacteroides of the human lower intestinal tract Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38 :293-313 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ). WT mice treated with metronidazole alone and Tlr4 −/− SPF mice both exhibited significant decreases in ISG expression in the mLN ( Figure 4 E; Table S3 ) and spleen ( Figure 4 F; Table S4 ). These findings confirm the potential for anaerobic commensal bacteria, of which Bacteroides are one of the most dominant taxa, to regulate the host IFN-I response through TLR4 signaling.
It was recently reported that constitutive, low-level induction of ISG expression by the commensal microbiota is required to prime macrophages to respond robustly to subsequent respiratory virus infection ( Abt et al., 2012 1. Abt, M.C. ∙ Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ... Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity Immunity. 2012; 37 :158-170 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was therefore hypothesized that commensal-induced IFN-β is functionally important for the priming of the antiviral response and resistance to virus infection. A murine vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection model, which causes meningoencephalitis and fatal paralytic disease, was used to investigate the role of commensal-induced IFN-β. To test the contribution of IFN-β to protection in this disease model, cohoused Ifnb1 +/+ and Ifnb1 −/− littermates were infected by subcutaneous injection into the footpad with 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFU) of VSV strain Indiana. Ifnb1 −/− mice exhibited increased susceptibility to disease based on all parameters tracked, with increased daily and cumulative disease scores ( Figures 5 A and 5D), incidence of disease ( Figure 5 B), and reduced survival ( Figure 5 C). These findings demonstrate a strong role for IFN-β in protection against subcutaneous VSV infection.
VSV infection itself induces IFN-β expression through PRR signaling, which likely contributes to ISG expression after infection and antiviral immunity ( Kato et al., 2005 20. Kato, H. ∙ Sato, S. ∙ Yoneyama, M. ... Cell type-specific involvement of RIG-I in antiviral response Immunity. 2005; 23 :19-28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the increased susceptibility observed in the Ifnb1 −/− mice likely reflects virus infection-induced IFN-β in addition to any contributions of priming levels of IFN-β induced by commensal microbes prior to infection. To investigate the effects of priming of the antiviral response by constitutive, microbiota-induced IFN-β, an IFN-β neutralizing antibody (anti-IFN-β) was used to selectively inhibit IFN-β prior to infection ( Sheehan et al., 2015 45. Sheehan, K.C. ∙ Lazear, H.M. ∙ Diamond, M.S. ... Selective Blockade of Interferon-α and -β Reveals Their Non-Redundant Functions in a Mouse Model of West Nile Virus Infection PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0128636 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). WT mice were administered two doses of anti-IFN-β or mouse IgG2a isotype control antibody by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, 72 h and 24 h prior to infection with 10 6 PFU of VSV. Anti-IFN-β-treated mice had increased severity of disease ( Figure S5 ) compared to isotype control treated mice. These data reveal that blockade of IFN-β prior to infection enhances susceptibility to subsequent VSV infection, supporting a role for commensal-induced, homeostatic IFN-β.
To further investigate the impact of the commensal microbiota on VSV infection, WT mice were administered ABX for 7 days prior to infection, stopping on the day of infection. Increased susceptibility to disease was observed in WT ABX mice compared to WT SPF mice, with significantly increased paralysis scores ( Figures 6 A and 6G), incidence of disease ( Figure 6 B), and reduced survival ( Figure 6 C). These data reveal a novel role for the commensal microbiota in natural resistance to VSV infection. Ifnb1 −/− mice were also subjected to 7 days of ABX treatment prior to infection with VSV Indiana. Interestingly, ABX treatment had no effect on the susceptibility of Ifnb1 −/− mice to VSV infection ( Figures 6 D–6G). In the absence of IFN-β, depletion of the microbiota therefore does not alter the response to VSV, demonstrating that the microbiota exerts its protective effect specifically through IFN-β.
To further investigate the antiviral activity of commensal-induced IFN-β, we sought to identify whether signaling of a purified IFN-β-inducing commensal microbial molecule, B. fragilis PSA, is sufficient to protect against virus infection. Although LOS and the LOS domain of PSA are responsible for IFN-β induction, whole PSA was used in this system due to its enhanced solubility. An in vitro virus infection model was developed in which BMDCs were treated with a dose response of PSA for 24 h prior to infection with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing strain of VSV Indiana (VSV-GFP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, followed by flow cytometric analysis of the percentage of infected (GFP + ) live cells 24 h post infection (h.p.i.) ( Figure S6 A) ( Dalton and Rose, 2001 6. Dalton, K.P. ∙ Rose, J.K. Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein containing the entire green fluorescent protein on its cytoplasmic domain is incorporated efficiently into virus particles Virology. 2001; 279 :414-421 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Priming with PSA inhibited virus infection in a dose-dependent manner, resulting not only in a lower percentage of infected cells ( Figure 7 A) but also increased cell viability ( Figure 7 C). To investigate the mechanism of antiviral activity, infection with VSV-GFP was compared in WT, Ifnb1 −/− , or Tlr4 −/− BMDCs that were primed with PSA for 24 h. Protection by PSA was completely lost in the absence of TLR4 or IFN-β signaling ( Figure 7 E), confirming that the observed antiviral function of PSA is indeed mediated by IFN-β signaling.
To identify whether the observed in vitro protective effects of PSA are limited to VSV infection, a second virus infection model was developed, using the murine adapted influenza A virus strain PR8 (IAV/PR8). WT, Ifnb1 −/− , or Tlr4 −/− BMDCs were primed with PSA followed by infection with a GFP-expressing IAV/PR8 strain (PR8-GFP) at an MOI of 1, followed by flow cytometric analysis 24 h.p.i. ( Figure S6 B) ( Manicassamy et al., 2010 27. Manicassamy, B. ∙ Manicassamy, S. ∙ Belicha-Villanueva, A. ... Analysis of in vivo dynamics of influenza virus infection in mice using a GFP reporter virus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :11531-11536 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Priming of WT BMDCs with PSA inhibited subsequent IAV infection, with a significant reduction in the percentage of infected cells ( Figure 7 B) and increase in cell viability ( Figure 7 D). This antiviral effect was completely abrogated in the absence of IFN-β or TLR4 ( Figure 7 F), revealing that signaling of PSA through the same pathway protects cells from infection with two different viruses. These results establish a novel in vitro broad-spectrum antiviral function of B. fragilis PSA.
To investigate the in vivo antiviral activity of PSA, WT or Ifnb1 −/− ABX mice were administered PSA daily by oral gavage starting 4 days prior to and continuing to the day of infection with VSV. PSA treatment significantly reduced disease severity in WT ABX mice, with decreased daily and cumulative paralysis scores ( Figures 6 A and 6G), incidence of disease ( Figure 6 B), and enhanced survival ( Figure 6 C), to levels statistically indistinguishable from WT SPF mice. In Ifnb1 −/− ABX mice, PSA treatment had no observable effect on disease severity ( Figures 6 D–6G), supporting the hypothesis that the protective effects of PSA are mediated through IFN-β. These findings demonstrate that not only is commensal induction of IFN-β necessary for protection against VSV infection, but treatment with a single IFN-β-inducing commensal microbial molecule is sufficient to restore the protective effects of the whole microbiota in this model.

Section: Discussion

We have described a novel mechanism of immunomodulation by the commensal microbiota through IFN-β-mediated regulation of the homeostatic IFN-I response. Furthermore, we identified the mechanism by which a specific species of commensal bacteria regulates this response, signaling of B. fragilis glycolipids through TLR4 to induce expression of IFN-β by colon LP DCs. Importantly, this commensal-mediated regulation of IFN-β and the IFN-I response was found to play a critical role in maintaining health of the host by enhancing resistance to virus infection.
Our findings are consistent with previous reports of commensal regulation of the IFN-I response, which identified that the microbiota induces constitutive IFN-I production and basal levels of ISG expression ( Abt et al., 2012 1. Abt, M.C. ∙ Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ... Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity Immunity. 2012; 37 :158-170 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schaupp et al., 2020 40. Schaupp, L. ∙ Muth, S. ∙ Rogell, L. ... Microbiota-Induced Type I Interferons Instruct a Poised Basal State of Dendritic Cells Cell. 2020; 181 :1080-1096 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our work builds on the existing literature by identifying which IFN-I family cytokine member is required for regulation of homeostatic ISG expression, a specific cellular source of commensal-induced IFN-β, and the molecular mechanism of IFN-β induction by a commensal microbial species. Interestingly, among the IFN-I family members, IFN-β has been demonstrated to possess unique functionality, with increased antiproliferative and regulatory function. IFN-I signaling can result in several different signaling outcomes all mediated through the same receptor. Importantly, the many different biological outcomes, whether pro- or anti-inflammatory, could be either beneficial or detrimental to the host depending on the context. The observed specific induction of IFN-β by the microbiota suggests controlled expression of the distinct IFN-Is to favor homeostatic expression only of the more regulatory variant, IFN-β.
Intestinal DCs have previously been established to carry commensal antigen to the mLN, where they are restricted from entering into systemic immune circulation, and thus remain in the intestinal immune compartment ( Macpherson and Uhr, 2004 25. Macpherson, A.J. ∙ Uhr, T. Induction of protective IgA by intestinal dendritic cells carrying commensal bacteria Science. 2004; 303 :1662-1665 Crossref Scopus (1266) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results are consistent with a model in which IFN-β is expressed in response to detection of microbial antigens by colon LP DCs, which then remain in the intestinal LP or traffic to the mLN. Despite this tight locational restriction of IFN-β expression, we observed systemic decreases in ISG expression in both Ifnb1 −/− and ABX mice as well as functional effects of commensal induced-IFN-β during virus infection at an extra-intestinal site. It is possible that IFN-β secreted in the intestinal environment enters the systemic circulation to mediate these effects. IFN-β is extremely potent, capable of inducing ISG expression with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 0.2 pM ( Schreiber and Piehler, 2015 42. Schreiber, G. ∙ Piehler, J. The molecular basis for functional plasticity in type I interferon signaling Trends Immunol. 2015; 36 :139-149 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). While there were no detectable levels of IFN-β in the serum of WT SPF mice, it is possible that a minute quantity of IFN-β might enter the circulation from the intestinal immune compartment and induce systemic effects on ISG expression. Alternatively, secretion of IFN-β by intestinal DCs might induce gene expression changes locally, in neighboring cells, which traffic to distal body sites. Further investigation will be required to determine which of these mechanisms accounts for systemic ISG expression under homeostatic conditions.
We discovered that the glycolipids of B. fragilis , PSA and LOS, signal through TLR4 to induce expression of IFN-β by DCs. Canonically, activation of TLR4 by bacterial LPS signals not only through TRIF to induce IFN-I signaling, but also through MyD88 to induce proinflammatory mediators ( Maeshima and Fernandez, 2013 26. Maeshima, N. ∙ Fernandez, R.C. Recognition of lipid A variants by the TLR4-MD-2 receptor complex Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2013; 3 :3 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Through activation of a robust and uncontrolled immune response, LPS exposure can cause severe systemic inflammation, leading to potentially lethal septic shock ( Bohannon et al., 2013 3. Bohannon, J.K. ∙ Hernandez, A. ∙ Enkhbaatar, P. ... The immunobiology of toll-like receptor 4 agonists: from endotoxin tolerance to immunoadjuvants Shock. 2013; 40 :451-462 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ; Molinaro et al., 2015 32. Molinaro, A. ∙ Holst, O. ∙ Di Lorenzo, F. ... Chemistry of lipid A: at the heart of innate immunity Chemistry. 2015; 21 :500-519 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a result of its endotoxicity, the clinical applications of LPS as an immunomodulator have been limited. However, most research on LPS has focused on E. coli ( Maeshima and Fernandez, 2013 26. Maeshima, N. ∙ Fernandez, R.C. Recognition of lipid A variants by the TLR4-MD-2 receptor complex Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2013; 3 :3 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using numerous assays including proinflammatory cytokine secretion, the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, rabbit pyrogenicity test, chick embryo lethality, and the Shwartzman reaction, B. fragilis LOS has previously been demonstrated to have low endotoxic activity, suggesting it is a less inflammatory LPS species ( Erturk-Hasdemir et al., 2019 10. Erturk-Hasdemir, D. ∙ Oh, S.F. ∙ Okan, N.A. ... Symbionts exploit complex signaling to educate the immune system Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :26157-26166 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kasper, 1976 18. Kasper, D.L. Chemical and biological characterization of the lipopolysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis J. Infect. Dis. 1976; 134 :59-66 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sveen et al., 1977 52. Sveen, K. ∙ Hofstad, T. ∙ Milner, K.C. Lethality for mice and chick embryos, pyrogenicity in rabbits and ability to gelate lysate from amoebocytes of Limulus polyphemus by lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and Veillonella Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. [B]. 1977; 85B :388-396 PubMed Google Scholar ). This difference in activity can be attributed to several structural differences between the two molecules. Whereas E. coli LPS is hexa-acylated, B. fragilis LOS represents a mixture of penta-, tetra-, and tri-acylated molecules ( Weintraub et al., 1989 58. Weintraub, A. ∙ Zähringer, U. ∙ Wollenweber, H.W. ... Structural characterization of the lipid A component of Bacteroides fragilis strain NCTC 9343 lipopolysaccharide Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183 :425-431 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the acyl-chains of B. fragilis LOS are longer, with C15–C17 fatty acid chains compared to C12–C14 fatty acids used by E. coli LPS ( Raetz et al., 2007 36. Raetz, C.R. ∙ Reynolds, C.M. ∙ Trent, M.S. ... Lipid A modification systems in gram-negative bacteria Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76 :295-329 Crossref Scopus (1024) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weintraub et al., 1989 58. Weintraub, A. ∙ Zähringer, U. ∙ Wollenweber, H.W. ... Structural characterization of the lipid A component of Bacteroides fragilis strain NCTC 9343 lipopolysaccharide Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183 :425-431 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the diglucosamine backbone of B. fragilis LOS is mono- or non-phosphorylated compared to the bis-phosphorylated lipid A of E. coli ( Molinaro et al., 2015 32. Molinaro, A. ∙ Holst, O. ∙ Di Lorenzo, F. ... Chemistry of lipid A: at the heart of innate immunity Chemistry. 2015; 21 :500-519 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weintraub et al., 1989 58. Weintraub, A. ∙ Zähringer, U. ∙ Wollenweber, H.W. ... Structural characterization of the lipid A component of Bacteroides fragilis strain NCTC 9343 lipopolysaccharide Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183 :425-431 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number and length of the acyl-chains as well as the phosphorylation state of the disaccharide backbone in LPS are critical factors affecting the interaction with TLR4 and the downstream function of these molecules ( Maeshima and Fernandez, 2013 26. Maeshima, N. ∙ Fernandez, R.C. Recognition of lipid A variants by the TLR4-MD-2 receptor complex Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2013; 3 :3 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this way, B. fragilis glycolipids might be able to induce the protective beneficial effects of IFN-β without the consequences of uncontrolled, pathologic inflammation.
Our findings suggest that induction of IFN-β through TLR4 signaling is not limited to B. fragilis but is a shared function of an entire class of commensal microbial molecules, Bacteroides LPS/LOS. Indeed, OM extracts from all of the Bacteroides sp. tested were able to induce IFN-β. OMs comprise numerous bacterial molecules, all of which have the potential to interact with immune cells and influence their response ( Kasper and Seiler, 1975 19. Kasper, D.L. ∙ Seiler, M.W. Immunochemical characterization of the outer membrane complex of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis J. Infect. Dis. 1975; 132 :440-450 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; May and Grabowicz, 2018 28. May, K.L. ∙ Grabowicz, M. The bacterial outer membrane is an evolving antibiotic barrier Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :8852-8854 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Isolation of LPS/LOS from each of these bacterial species will therefore be required to further assess their IFN-β-inducing capabilities. Importantly, the genus Bacteroides makes up a large proportion of the human GI microbiome and is widespread in prevalence across the human population ( Salyers, 1984 38. Salyers, A.A. Bacteroides of the human lower intestinal tract Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38 :293-313 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wexler, 2007 59. Wexler, H.M. Bacteroides: the good, the bad, and the nitty-gritty Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2007; 20 :593-621 Crossref Scopus (1491) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, Bacteroides LOS/LPS species might be the most abundant microbial molecules in the GI tract. As such, it is plausible that Bacteroides- induced IFN-β represents a ubiquitous mechanism by which commensal microbes communicate with their host to regulate the immune system and other physiological processes, ultimately contributing to human health.
Low-level induction of ISG expression under homeostatic conditions primes cells of the immune system so that they can respond effectively to subsequent virus infection and ultimately reduces severity of disease ( Abt et al., 2012 1. Abt, M.C. ∙ Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ... Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity Immunity. 2012; 37 :158-170 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore plausible that the observed antiviral effect of commensal-induced IFN-β is mediated through priming of constitutive expression of ISGs, thus arming the immune system to respond immediately and robustly to virus infection. Due to the important role of IFN-I signaling and ISG expression in the context of the majority of mammalian virus infections, such a finding might represent a broad spectrum, and therefore universally important, antiviral activity of the commensal microbiota ( van den Broek et al., 1995 56. van den Broek, M.F. ∙ Müller, U. ∙ Huang, S. ... Immune defence in mice lacking type I and/or type II interferon receptors Immunol. Rev. 1995; 148 :5-18 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to antiviral immunity, IFN-Is have been described to influence numerous other vital aspects of host physiology, including immune tolerance, antitumor immunity, cytokine signaling regulation, bone homeostasis, and hematopoiesis ( Gough et al., 2012 14. Gough, D.J. ∙ Messina, N.L. ∙ Clarke, C.J. ... Constitutive type I interferon modulates homeostatic balance through tonic signaling Immunity. 2012; 36 :166-174 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore possible that the commensal microbiota influences each of these processes as well, through the ability to regulate IFN-β. Future studies will be required to determine the importance of commensal-induced IFN-β in each of these physiological processes and the potential therapeutic use of IFN-β-inducing commensal microbial molecules, such as PSA, in a wide array of human diseases. Current IFN-I-based therapies rely on the administration of non-physiologic amounts of exogenous IFN-Is, which can have unwanted side effects ( Gottberg et al., 2000 13. Gottberg, K. ∙ Gardulf, A. ∙ Fredrikson, S. Interferon-beta treatment for patients with multiple sclerosis: the patients’ perceptions of the side-effects Mult. Scler. 2000; 6 :349-354 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sleijfer et al., 2005 48. Sleijfer, S. ∙ Bannink, M. ∙ Van Gool, A.R. ... Side effects of interferon-alpha therapy Pharm. World Sci. 2005; 27 :423-431 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Delivery of an IFN-β-inducing microbial molecule thus represents a novel IFN-I-based therapeutic approach, which could enhance the IFN-I response while still being subjected to homeostatic regulatory mechanisms, reducing the potential for undesired side effects.

Details of mouse strains used in this study can be found in the Key Resources Table . Conventional SPF mice were housed under SPF conditions in the Harvard Medical School mouse vivarium. All genetically deficient mice and their respective controls were gender- and age-matched (typically 5–10 weeks) and both males and females were used in this study. Mice were assigned randomly to experimental groups. Germ free C57BL/6 mice were originally purchased from the National Gnotobiotic Rodent Resource Center of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and were bred and maintained in sterile vinyl isolators in the animal facility at Harvard Medical School. Sterility was checked weekly by aerobic and anaerobic microbial culture. For monocolonization studies, experimental manipulation of mice was performed in autoclaved cages in which animals received autoclaved food and water. All experiments on animals were approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals (animal protocol number IS00000187-3).
The bacteria strains used in this study are described in the Key Resources Table . All bacteria used in this study were grown on Brucella blood agar plates or in liquid culture in rich Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BD) supplemented with Hemin (0.01%), vitamin K (0.1 mg/mL), glucose (0.5%), Monopotassium phosphate (0.5%), and L-cysteine (0.1%) in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Industries) at 37°C (C).
For studies involving depletion of the microbiota, SPF mice of the indicated strains were treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotics cocktail for 7 days. Vancomycin hydrochloride (0.5 g/L, Alfa Aesar), gentamicin sulfate (0.5 g/L, Sigma-Aldrich), and ampicillin (1 g/L, MP Biomedicals) were administered in the drinking water. Metronidazole (8 g/L, Alfa Aesar) and amphotericin B (0.1 g/L, Amresco Inc) were administered in 200 uL by OG once daily. Fecal samples were collected and plated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to confirm microbiota depletion. For studies involving treatment with metronidazole alone, Metronidazole (0.5g/L, Alfa Aesar) was administered in the drinking water for 7 days.
RNA was isolated from whole tissues or the DC + and DC - fractions of spleens, mLNs, and colons following manufacturer’s instructions with the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was prepared with the Quantitect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). qRT-PCR was performed on a QuantStudio7 Flex or Pro Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with RT 2 SYBR Green ROX qPCR Mastermix (QIAGEN). Amplification was achieved using an initial cycle of 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Gene expression was normalized using Actb as a reference gene. The forward (f) and reverse (r) primers used to detect expression of the corresponding murine genes are described in Table S5 .
Single-cell suspensions of the colonic lamina propria were prepared as previously described ( Dasgupta et al., 2014 7. Dasgupta, S. ∙ Erturk-Hasdemir, D. ∙ Ochoa-Reparaz, J. ... Plasmacytoid dendritic cells mediate anti-inflammatory responses to a gut commensal molecule via both innate and adaptive mechanisms Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 15 :413-423 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the tissue was cut transversely into approximately 2 cm pieces and then longitudinally to expose the lumen. To extract epithelial cells, tissue pieces were incubated in 1mM dithiothreitol (Sigma) in PBS for 10 minutes, washed, and incubated in 30mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) three times for 8 minutes each. To digest the tissue, colon pieces were treated with RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 mg/mL collagenase type IV for 45 minutes at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and then passed through a 70 μM filter. For single-cell suspensions of mLNs and spleens, tissues were harvested, treated with 1mg/mL collagenase type IV in RPMI for 30 minutes at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 , and passed through a 70 μm filter. Splenic samples were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (GIBCO).
Single-cell suspensions of the indicated tissues were prepared as described. DC positive and negative fractions were isolated with mouse pan-DC microbeads (Miltenyi), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
GF WT C57BL/6 mice were administered B. fragilis strain NCTC 9343 or C. ramosum strain AO31 by oral gavage [200 uL, approximately 10 8 -10 9 colony-forming units (CFU) per mouse]. Mice were housed in autoclaved cages and maintained on a diet of autoclaved food and water for 2 weeks and then euthanized for analysis.
For serum analysis, WT SPF or antibiotics treated mice were euthanized and blood was collected into 1.1 mL Z-Gel Micro Tubes (Sarstedt). Blood was left at room temperature for 30 minutes, centrifuged to remove coagulated cells [12,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), 10 minutes], and levels of IFNβ in the serum were quantified with the High Sensitivity Mouse IFN Beta ELISA kit (PBL Assay Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For cell culture supernatant analysis, cell free supernatants were collected from BMDC cultures and IFNβ levels were quantified with the Mouse IFN Beta ELISA kit (PBL Assay Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
DCs were derived from bone marrow of the indicated mice as previously described ( Helft et al., 2015 15. Helft, J. ∙ Böttcher, J. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ... GM-CSF Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures Comprise a Heterogeneous Population of CD11c(+)MHCII(+) Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Immunity. 2015; 42 :1197-1211 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, bone marrow was collected from femurs, treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (GIBCO), and cultured in 10 cm tissue culture (TC)-treated dishes at a density of 10x10 6 cells in 10 mL per plate in complete RPMI medium (cRPMI: RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol) with 20 ng/mL granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Cells were cultured for 6 days at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 with replenishment of medium on day 3. On day 6 the non-adherent and loosely adherent cells were harvested and plated at a density of 10 6 cells/mL in 200 uL per well of a 96-well round-bottom TC-treated cell culture plate for use in the indicated experimental procedures.
OM complexes were isolated from the indicated Bacteroides sp. as previously described ( Kasper and Seiler, 1975 19. Kasper, D.L. ∙ Seiler, M.W. Immunochemical characterization of the outer membrane complex of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis J. Infect. Dis. 1975; 132 :440-450 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mid-log phase bacteria were pelleted, washed twice in 0.15 M sodium chloride (NaCl) and resuspended in a buffer of 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M sodium phosphate, and 0.01 M EDTA. The resuspended organisms were incubated for 30 minutes at 60°C then subjected to mild shearing pressure by passing through a 25-gauge hypodermic needle. Cells were pelleted from the suspension and the supernatants were harvested and subjected to two rounds of centrifugation at 33,000 RPM for 2 hr at 4°C to pellet the OM extracts.
PSA was purified from B. fragilis mutant strain Δ44 and LOS was purified from an acapsular B. fragilis mutant strain by phenol-water extraction as previously described ( Tzianabos et al., 1992 55. Tzianabos, A.O. ∙ Pantosti, A. ∙ Baumann, H. ... The capsular polysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis comprises two ionically linked polysaccharides J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 :18230-18235 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). To obtain the purified delipidated polysaccharide domain of PSA, PSA was subjected to acid hydrolysis with 2% acetic acid at 90°C for 2 h. The sample was neutralized the lipid was removed using chloroform/methanol extraction.
The antibodies used for flow cytometric analysis are described in the Key Resources Table . Single-cell suspensions were stained with a suitable combination of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and fixable viability dye. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and examined with an LSR II flow cytometer (BD). The data were analyzed with FlowJo software.
Mice were anesthetized by IP injection of ketamine and xylazine. 1x10 6 PFU of VSV strain Indiana was delivered in 10 uL per mouse by subcutaneous injection into the footpad as previously described ( Fensterl et al., 2014 11. Fensterl, V. ∙ Wetzel, J.L. ∙ Sen, G.C. Interferon-induced protein Ifit2 protects mice from infection of the peripheral nervous system by vesicular stomatitis virus J. Virol. 2014; 88 :10303-10311 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Body weight and clinical disease score were monitored daily for 14 days following infection. VSV-infected mice exhibit an ascending paralytic disease that was scored as follows: 0 = no symptoms, 1 = tail paralysis, 2 = hind-limb weakness, 2.5 = paralysis of one hind limb, 3 = paralysis of both hind limbs, 3.5 = paralysis of both hind limbs and forelimb weakness, 4 = forelimb and hind-limb paralysis, 5 = moribund). Mice with a body condition score ≤ 2 or a disease score ≥ 4 were humanely euthanized.
On day 6 of culture, GM-CSF BMDCs were plated at a density of 10 6 cells/mL in 200 uL of cRPMI medium per well of a 96-well round-bottom TC-treated cell culture plate with 20 ng/mL GM-CSF and the indicated treatments for 24 hr, washed, and resuspended in cRPMI medium containing either IAV/PR8-GFP or VSV-GFP at an MOI of 1. Cells were harvested for flow cytometric analysis 24 hr post infection.
Mice were administered two doses of 250 ug IFNβ neutralizing antibody (anti-IFNβ, clone HDβ-4A7; Leinco Technologies) or Mouse IgG2a isotype control antibody (Leinco Technologies) by IP injection, 72 hr and 24 hr prior to infection with 10 6 PFU of VSV strain Indiana.
