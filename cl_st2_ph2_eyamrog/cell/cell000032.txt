Title: Posttranslational Modifications Mediate the Structural Diversity of Tauopathy Strains


Abstract: Summary

Tau aggregation into insoluble filaments is the defining pathological hallmark of tauopathies. However, it is not known what controls the formation and templated seeding of strain-specific structures associated with individual tauopathies. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of tau filaments from corticobasal degeneration (CBD) human brain tissue. Cryo-EM and mass spectrometry of tau filaments from CBD reveal that this conformer is heavily decorated with posttranslational modifications (PTMs), enabling us to map PTMs directly onto the structures. By comparing the structures and PTMs of tau filaments from CBD and Alzheimer’s disease, it is found that ubiquitination of tau can mediate inter-protofilament interfaces. We propose a structure-based model in which cross-talk between PTMs influences tau filament structure, contributing to the structural diversity of tauopathy strains. Our approach establishes a framework for further elucidating the relationship between the structures of polymorphic fibrils, including their PTMs, and neurodegenerative disease.

Section: Introduction

Tauopathies are a broad class of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by pathological aggregation of the tau protein ( Ballatore et al., 2007 4. Ballatore, C. ∙ Lee, V.M. ∙ Trojanowski, J.Q. Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8 :663-672 Crossref Scopus (1731) PubMed Google Scholar ). These diseases present diverse clinical syndromes with substantial variability in phenotype within affected families and between patients ( Irwin, 2016 36. Irwin, D.J. Tauopathies as clinicopathological entities Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2016; 22 :S29-S33 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). Primary tauopathies, such as Pick’s disease (PiD) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), are epitomized by neuronal and glial tau inclusions ( Dickson et al., 2011 15. Dickson, D.W. ∙ Kouri, N. ∙ Murray, M.E. ... Neuropathology of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau (FTLD-tau) J. Mol. Neurosci. 2011; 45 :384-389 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a secondary tauopathy, is typified by a combination of tau aggregates and extracellular amyloid plaques ( Bloom, 2014 5. Bloom, G.S. Amyloid-β and tau: the trigger and bullet in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis JAMA Neurol. 2014; 71 :505-508 Crossref Scopus (1324) PubMed Google Scholar ). Little is known about how abnormal tau can give rise to such varied phenotypes, but recent structures have identified differently folded forms of tau forming the building block of the amyloid state ( Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012 17. Eisenberg, D. ∙ Jucker, M. The amyloid state of proteins in human diseases Cell. 2012; 148 :1188-1203 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ) in different tauopathies ( Falcon et al., 2018a, 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 20.

These results have led to the hypothesis that each tauopathy may be characterized by a disease-specific, misfolded conformer ( Fitzpatrick and Saibil, 2019; Goedert et al., 2018 26. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Saibil, H.R. Cryo-EM of amyloid fibrils and cellular aggregates Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 58 :34-42 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar 29.

Biol. 2018; 83 :163-171 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ).
At the molecular level, misfolded tau aggregates via distinct conformations (or strains) of the monomer, which are likely to be influenced by the local cellular environment ( Kaufman et al., 2016 40. Kaufman, S.K. ∙ Sanders, D.W. ∙ Thomas, T.L. ... Tau Prion Strains Dictate Patterns of Cell Pathology, Progression Rate, and Regional Vulnerability In Vivo Neuron. 2016; 92 :796-812 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). These form hydrogen-bonded protofilaments, which may pack together laterally into fibrils in multiple ways ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ). This hierarchical assembly leads to molecular ( Petkova et al., 2005 57. Petkova, A.T. ∙ Leapman, R.D. ∙ Guo, Z. ... Self-propagating, molecular-level polymorphism in Alzheimer’s beta-amyloid fibrils Science. 2005; 307 :262-265 Crossref Scopus (1486) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ultrastructural polymorphism ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2013; Fitzpatrick and Saibil, 2019 26. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Saibil, H.R. Cryo-EM of amyloid fibrils and cellular aggregates Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 58 :34-42 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar 27.

USA. 2013; 110 :5468-5473 Crossref Scopus (448) PubMed Google Scholar ), giving rise to unique molecular signatures for each tauopathy ( Falcon et al., 2018a, 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar 22.

However, two key questions remain: why do misfolded tau molecules consistently aggregate into unique, disease-specific strains? And what are the tau and non-tau components directing this pathological self-assembly?
A potential explanation lies in posttranslational modification (PTM), the least understood molecular determinant of tauopathies ( Kontaxi et al., 2017; Park et al., 2018 44. Kontaxi, C. ∙ Piccardo, P. ∙ Gill, A.C. Lysine-Directed Post-translational Modifications of Tau Protein in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Tauopathies Front. Mol.

Degradation or aggregation: the ramifications of post-translational modifications on tau BMB Rep. 2018; 51 :265-273 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Numerous PTMs of tau have been identified ( Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2012 51. Mandelkow, E.M. ∙ Mandelkow, E. Biochemistry and cell biology of tau protein in neurofibrillary degeneration Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2 :a006247 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ), with differences in modification profiles detected in different tauopathies ( Kontaxi et al., 2017; Park et al., 2018 44. Kontaxi, C. ∙ Piccardo, P. ∙ Gill, A.C. Lysine-Directed Post-translational Modifications of Tau Protein in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Tauopathies Front. Mol.

Degradation or aggregation: the ramifications of post-translational modifications on tau BMB Rep. 2018; 51 :265-273 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that such changes, regulated or otherwise, to the amino-acid sequence could modulate the conformational state of the tau monomer and manifest themselves in the structure of tau filaments. However, structural studies have failed to identify PTMs ( Falcon et al., 2018a, 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Falcon, B. ∙ Zivanov, J. ∙ Zhang, W. ...

Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ) likely because of the treatment of the tau ( Falcon et al., 2018a 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar ) and other tissue-derived ( Kollmer et al., 2019 43. Kollmer, M. ∙ Close, W. ∙ Funk, L. ... Cryo-EM structure and polymorphism of Aβ amyloid fibrils purified from Alzheimer’s brain tissue Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4760 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) protein filaments with pronase to achieve high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps.
Here, using a combination of cryo-EM and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we identified the insoluble filament core and solved the structures of posttranslationally modified straight and twisted tau filaments from the brains of patients with CBD ( Ksiezak-Reding et al., 1996; Tracz et al., 1997 46. Ksiezak-Reding, H. ∙ Tracz, E. ∙ Yang, L.S. ... Ultrastructural instability of paired helical filaments from corticobasal degeneration as examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy Am. J.

Paired helical filaments in corticobasal degeneration: the fine fibrillary structure with NanoVan Brain Res. 1997; 773 :33-44 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ) or AD ( Crowther, 1991; Kidd, 1963; Terry, 1963 12. Crowther, R.A. Straight and paired helical filaments in Alzheimer disease have a common structural unit Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88 :2288-2292 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Kidd, M. Paired helical filaments in electron microscopy of Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 1963; 197 :192-193 Crossref Scopus (812) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Terry, R.D. The Fine Structure of Neurofibrillary Tangles in Alzheimer’s Disease J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1963; 22 :629-642 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we imaged undigested tau filaments using cryo-EM in order to fully resolve tau protein conformers in CBD and AD, complete with the PTMs that form a crucial and biologically informative part of the structures. In addition to mapping PTMs from multiple cases onto atomic models of tau filaments from CBD and AD, we identified a structural role played by PTMs in mediating inter-protofilament interfaces. As such, we propose a structure-based model in which site-specific ubiquitination of tau influences the resulting filament structure, thereby modulating distinct fibril subpopulations.

Section: Results

A distinctive neuropathologic feature of CBD is focal cortical atrophy with swollen cortical neurons (“ballooned neurons” [BN], Figure 1 A), which contain phosphorylated neurofilaments ( Dickson et al., 1986 14. Dickson, D.W. ∙ Yen, S.H. ∙ Suzuki, K.I. ... Ballooned neurons in select neurodegenerative diseases contain phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes Acta Neuropathol. 1986; 71 :216-223 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to BN, affected cortical and subcortical areas have many tau-immunoreactive neuronal processes (“threads,” Figures 1 B–1D) and pleomorphic neuronal inclusions ( Figures 1 C and 1D). The latter may be densely packed inclusions reminiscent of Pick bodies or small neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) or filamentous inclusions that are more dispersed and disorderly, consistent with so-called pretangles. Accompanying threads and pretangles are tau-positive argyrophilic inclusions in oligodendroglia (often referred to as “coiled bodies”) ( Braak and Braak, 1998 7. Braak, H. ∙ Braak, E. Argyrophilic grain disease: frequency of occurrence in different age categories and neuropathological diagnostic criteria J. Neural Transm. (Vienna). 1998; 105 :801-819 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as tau-immunoreactive astrocytic lesions that appear as annular clusters of short fuzzy cell processes, which may be suggestive of a neuritic plaque. These astrocytic lesions are referred to as “astrocytic plaques” ( Feany and Dickson, 1995 24. Feany, M.B. ∙ Dickson, D.W. Widespread cytoskeletal pathology characterizes corticobasal degeneration Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146 :1388-1396 PubMed Google Scholar ). Tau lesions in CBD are composed predominantly of tau isoforms containing four microtubule-binding repeats (4R tau) ( Sergeant et al., 1999 61. Sergeant, N. ∙ Wattez, A. ∙ Delacourte, A. Neurofibrillary degeneration in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration: tau pathologies with exclusively “exon 10” isoforms J. Neurochem. 1999; 72 :1243-1249 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ), with ultrastructural studies revealing both straight and twisted filaments ( Ksiezak-Reding et al., 1996; Tracz et al., 1997 46. Ksiezak-Reding, H. ∙ Tracz, E. ∙ Yang, L.S. ... Ultrastructural instability of paired helical filaments from corticobasal degeneration as examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy Am. J.

Sarkosyl-insoluble material used for cryo-EM was first evaluated by western blot ( Figure 1 E), immunogold negative stain EM ( Figure 1 F), cryo-EM ( Figure 1 G), and pronase-resistance by dot blot analysis ( Figure 1 H). In particular, immunoreactivity of various tau antibodies ( Ercan et al., 2017; Irwin et al., 2012; Morris et al., 2015 19. Ercan, E. ∙ Eid, S. ∙ Weber, C. ... A validated antibody panel for the characterization of tau post-translational modifications Mol. Neurodegener. 2017; 12 :87 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar 37. Irwin, D.J. ∙ Cohen, T.J. ∙ Grossman, M. ... Acetylated tau, a novel pathological signature in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies Brain. 2012; 135 :807-818 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Morris, M. ∙ Knudsen, G.M. ∙ Maeda, S. ... Tau post-translational modifications in wild-type and human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :1183-1189 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 I) was utilized to confirm that pronase treatment effectively removed soluble regions of the tau protein that were exposed while regions inside the filament core were protected and thus resistant to pronase activity. As anticipated, pronase treatment of CBD sarkosyl-insoluble material eliminated immunoreactivity of the extreme N- and C-terminal epitopes detected by E1 and Tau46, respectively. CP13 (pS202) was also sensitive to pronase, indicating that this phospho-epitope is outside of the filament core in CBD. Conversely, 12E8 (pS262/356) and PHF1 (pS396/404) were pronase-resistant, suggesting that CBD sarkosyl-insoluble material is phosphorylated at both epitopes and that these PTMs are not impacted by exposure to pronase. Similar results were observed with sarkosyl-insoluble material from AD and the tauopathies progressive supranuclear palsy and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), whereas notable differences in pronase sensitivity and resistance of tau epitopes were detected in sarkosyl-insoluble material from PiD. Finally, ubiquitination of sarkosyl-insoluble material was evaluated both prior to and following exposure to pronase. Although abundant ubiquitin immunoreactivity is observed in CBD sarkosyl-insoluble material, the signal quickly disappears upon pronase treatment, indicating that pronase eliminates ubiquitination of the CBD tau core. The sarkosyl-insoluble material from other tauopathies exhibited a similar sensitivity of ubiquitin immunoreactivity toward pronase with the exception of CTE. Given the loss of ubiquitination upon exposure to pronase, these results reveal that pronase treatment ( Falcon et al., 2018a; Kollmer et al., 2019 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Kollmer, M. ∙ Close, W. ∙ Funk, L. ... Cryo-EM structure and polymorphism of Aβ amyloid fibrils purified from Alzheimer’s brain tissue Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4760 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) will result in incomplete structure determination, particularly with respect to ubiquitination, so we proceeded without including this step.
Following basic characterization of the sarkosyl-insoluble material used for cryo-EM analysis ( Figures 1 A–1F and S1 ), we then examined filament morphology at high resolution. Consistent with previous reports ( Ksiezak-Reding et al., 1996; Tracz et al., 1997 46. Ksiezak-Reding, H. ∙ Tracz, E. ∙ Yang, L.S. ... Ultrastructural instability of paired helical filaments from corticobasal degeneration as examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149 :639-651 PubMed Google Scholar 65. Tracz, E. ∙ Dickson, D.W. ∙ Hainfeld, J.F. ... Paired helical filaments in corticobasal degeneration: the fine fibrillary structure with NanoVan Brain Res. 1997; 773 :33-44 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), CBD sarkosyl-insoluble fractions were characterized by both twisted and straight filaments (readily distinguishable in cryo-EM images), with twisted filaments measuring twice the width of straight filaments ( Figure 1 G). We designated these two subtypes as doublet and singlet fibrils, respectively. Singlet fibrils have a helical twist with a crossover distance of approximately 1,050 Å, whereas doublet fibrils have a crossover distance of approximately 1,300 Å, with the ratio of singlet to doublet fibrils being approximately 1:2.
Singlet ( Figure 2 A) and doublet ( Figure 2 B) fibrils were manually selected and reconstructed from 30,804 micrographs, using helical reconstruction in RELION, to a resolution of 4.3 Å and 3.8 Å, respectively ( Figure S2 ). Singlet fibrils are composed of a single protofilament ( Figure 2 A), whereas doublet fibrils exhibit a 2-fold symmetrical arrangement of this common protofilament ( Figure 2 B). Note that strong, large densities are visibly attached to K 321 , K 343 , K 353 , H 362 , and K 369 on our singlet map ( Figure 2 A) and K 321 , K 353 , and H 362 on our doublet map ( Figure 2 B), indicating that non-tau components are an integral part of the CBD tau fibril core ( Figure 2 C).
The core structure is comprised of residues K 274 –E 380 of the tau protein, spanning the last residue of R1, all of R2–R4, and 12 amino acids following R4 ( Figure 3 A). This tau fold adopts 11 β strands (β1–β11): three from R2 (β1–β3), three from R3 (β4–β6), four from R4 (β7–β10), and one formed by N 368 –E 380 (β11) ( Figure 2 C). The β strands are interconnected by β-breaking prolines (P 312 ), β-turn glycines (G 292 , G 323 ), or β-arc residues (D 283 , E 342 , D 348 ) ( Figures 2 C and 3 A). The tandem repeats R1–R4 all contain a versatile PGGG motif that can form a tight turn between β3→β4 or adopt an extended β-spiral conformation connecting β6→β7 and β10→β11 ( Figures 2 C and 3 A). Multi-sheet, cross-β interfaces are formed between β10→β3→β4→β7 and β6→β5→β2 ( Figure 2 ). The N and C termini close the common protofilament structure by packing β1 against β11 ( Figure 2 ). Clustering different combinations of the hydrophobic residues F, I, L, and V stabilizes most of the inter-sheet interfaces ( Figure 2 C). Notably, a large, rhomboidal, and hydrophilic cavity is formed by residues K 281 –N 296 and D 358 –H 374 , which enclose an unknown, organic density that is not part of the tau molecule ( Figure 2 ).
Similar to other tau conformers ( Falcon et al., 2018a, 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Falcon, B. ∙ Zivanov, J. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Novel tau filament fold in chronic traumatic encephalopathy encloses hydrophobic molecules Nature. 2019; 568 :420-423 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ), an ordered, in-register, and parallel hydrogen-bonding pattern is maintained throughout the disease-specific CBD tau protofilament structure. In terms of intra-sheet sidechain stacking and secondary structure, tau filaments from CBD closely match those from AD, with the main difference being that R2 and one C-terminal residue from R1 are in the ordered core structure ( Figures 2 C and 3 ). The β strand and loop-forming segments in CBD and AD are identical in one C-terminal residue from R1 or R2, all of R3 and R4, and 12 residues beyond R4 ( Figure 3 ). This indicates that the tau molecule can misfold into myriad conformers while preserving highly conserved secondary structure motifs ( Figure 3 ). The diversity of disease-specific protofilament structures becomes apparent when comparing inter-sheet interactions, which we visualize using contact maps ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and S3 ). By plotting a heatmap of inter-residue Cα-Cα distances within the tau protofilaments found in CBD ( Figure 4 A), AD ( Figure 4 B), and PiD ( Figure S3 ), it is possible to clearly identify the inter-sheet contacts that nucleate and propagate these disease-specific strains. The CBD tau protofilament is shaped by close interactions between K 369 –E 380 →R2, R4→R2, R2→R3, and R3→R3; the AD tau protofilament by R3→R4 and K 369 –E 380 →R3 (the CTE tau protofilament is almost identical to AD) ( Falcon et al., 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 22.

Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ); and the PiD tau protofilament by K 369 –E 378 →R4, R1→R4, and R3→R3 ( Falcon et al., 2018a 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, the aggregation of different tau isoforms—4R tau (CBD), 4R + 3R tau (AD and CTE), and 3R tau (PiD)—occurs by forming inter-sheet contacts between permutations of R1–R4 and K 369 –E 380 , leading to enormously different intra-protofilament packings and unique conformational strains ( Falcon et al., 2018a, 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar 22.

What is emerging, however, is that each tauopathy has a characteristic strain, which is observed in multiple patients and different brain regions ( Falcon et al., 2018b 21. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Schweighauser, M. ... Tau filaments from multiple cases of sporadic and inherited Alzheimer’s disease adopt a common fold Acta Neuropathol. 2018; 136 :699-708 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that recombinant tau can misfold into many different conformers ( Zhang et al., 2019a 73. Zhang, W. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Heparin-induced tau filaments are polymorphic and differ from those in Alzheimer’s and Pick’s diseases eLife. 2019; 8 :e43584 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ), this implies that there may be other factors modulating tau fibrillar self-assembly in vivo to faithfully nucleate and seed unique strains in each tauopathy.
Given the ordered cores of tau filaments in CBD and AD share almost all secondary structure elements apart from additional β strands formed by R2 in CBD, we used MS ( Figures 3 and S4 ; Tables S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 ) to identify the additional densities connected to tau filaments in CBD ( Figure 2 ) and AD ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; Goedert et al., 2018 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar 29. Goedert, M. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Distinct Conformers of Assembled Tau in Alzheimer’s and Pick’s Diseases Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2018; 83 :163-171 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), which we hypothesized could be PTMs. We performed MS on tau filaments from CBD case 1 ( Figure 1 ), the structures of which were solved by cryo-EM ( Figure 2 ); CBD case 2 ( Figures S5 A–S5C); two small pooled CBD cohorts ( Table S1 ); and a single AD case ( Figures S5 D–S5I), which was also solved by cryo-EM ( Figures S2 D and S6 ). In the fibril-forming core regions of tau filaments from CBD (K 274 –E 380 ) and AD (G 304 –E 380 ), we achieved 96% and 100% sequence coverage, respectively ( Figure 3 ; Tables S1 and S2 ). Tau filaments in CBD and AD have extensive PTMs, including phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination ( Figures 3 and S4 ). Phosphorylation occurs largely in the fuzzy coat ( Figure S4 ), with the tandem repeats R1–R4 and K 369 –E 380 almost exclusively acetylated or ubiquitinated ( Figure 3 ). Although we cannot completely exclude modifications by ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMOylation ( Luo et al., 2014 50. Luo, H.B. ∙ Xia, Y.Y. ∙ Shu, X.J. ... SUMOylation at K340 inhibits tau degradation through deregulating its phosphorylation and ubiquitination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :16586-16591 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ) or Neddylation ( Dil Kuazi et al., 2003 16. Dil Kuazi, A. ∙ Kito, K. ∙ Abe, Y. ... NEDD8 protein is involved in ubiquitinated inclusion bodies J. Pathol. 2003; 199 :259-266 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), MS analysis of poly-ubiquitinated tau in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from CBD and AD postmortem tissue yielded orders of magnitude more spectral counts of C-terminal 76 GG 75 ubiquitin fragments and ubiquitin sites ( Tables S1 , S2 , and S4 ) than these rare PTMs.
The majority of acetylation or ubiquitination sites occur within the fibril-forming core regions in CBD ( Figures 3 B and S7 ) and AD ( Figure 3 C), suggesting that these modifications may play a role in modulating pathological tau aggregation. By neutralizing the repulsion of positively charged lysine residues, acetylation in a site-specific manner is predicted to make the tau protein less soluble ( Figure 4 C) and has been shown to promote tau aggregation ( Cohen et al., 2011; Trzeciakiewicz et al., 2017 10.

Acetylation of tau inhibits its degradation and contributes to tauopathy Neuron. 2010; 67 :953-966 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ). Charge neutralization of lysines via acetylation makes parallel, in-register stacking of β strands more favorable, because there is less charge repulsion between positively charged sidechains ( Figure 4 D).
Ubiquitination of tau filaments in CBD and AD may not only be a signal for degradation ( Myeku et al., 2016; Petrucelli et al., 2004 54. Myeku, N. ∙ Clelland, C.L. ∙ Emrani, S. ...

Genet. 2004; 13 :703-714 Crossref Scopus (621) PubMed Google Scholar ) but could also play a structural role in fibrillization ( Dickey et al., 2006; Park et al., 2018 13. Dickey, C.A. ∙ Yue, M. ∙ Lin, W.L. ... Deletion of the ubiquitin ligase CHIP leads to the accumulation, but not the aggregation, of both endogenous phospho- and caspase-3-cleaved tau species J.

Degradation or aggregation: the ramifications of post-translational modifications on tau BMB Rep. 2018; 51 :265-273 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). MS indicates that tau filaments in CBD have three ubiquitination sites per protofilament at K 343 , K 369 , and K 375 ( Figures 3 B and S7 ). Strong, large densities are visibly attached to K 321 , K 343 , K 353 , and K 369 on our singlet map ( Figure 5 A) and K 321 and K 353 on our doublet map ( Figure 6 A), indicating additional proteinaceous material at the periphery of the fibril core. The tau protofilaments in AD also display additional densities connected to lysine sidechains, which are particularly visible at K 317 and K 321 ( Figures 5 C, 6 C and S6 ). MS of tau filaments in AD ( Figures 3 A and 3C) indicates that K 311 , K 317 , and K 321 are ubiquitinated, consistent with previous reports ( Abreha et al., 2018; Cripps et al., 2006; Park et al., 2018 1. Abreha, M.H. ∙ Dammer, E.B. ∙ Ping, L. ... Quantitative Analysis of the Brain Ubiquitylome in Alzheimer’s Disease Proteomics. 2018; 18 :e1800108 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar 11.

Degradation or aggregation: the ramifications of post-translational modifications on tau BMB Rep. 2018; 51 :265-273 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Based on a combination of MS and strong, large lysine-connected cryo-EM densities, we propose that the tau protofilaments in AD and CBD are mono- or poly-ubiquitinated ( Abreha et al., 2018; Cripps et al., 2006 1. Abreha, M.H. ∙ Dammer, E.B. ∙ Ping, L. ... Quantitative Analysis of the Brain Ubiquitylome in Alzheimer’s Disease Proteomics. 2018; 18 :e1800108 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar 11.

Chem. 2006; 281 :10825-10838 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ). The terminal 76 GG 75 ubiquitin fragment density is as strong as that of tau ( Figures 5 A and 5C), suggesting near-stoichiometric occupancy, with the rest of the ubiquitin molecules either cleaved or highly dynamic and thus not visible by cryo-EM helical reconstruction. In addition to marking the fibril for degradation by the 20S and 26S proteasome ( Lee et al., 2013 48. Lee, M.J. ∙ Lee, J.H. ∙ Rubinsztein, D.C. Tau degradation: the ubiquitin-proteasome system versus the autophagy-lysosome system Prog. Neurobiol. 2013; 105 :49-59 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ), stacking of ubiquitin chains covalently attached to the protofilament subunits in CBD ( Figure 5 B) and AD ( Figure 5 D) may stabilize the β strand stacking along the long axis of the fibrils.
In CBD doublet fibrils, the packing between protofilaments is mediated by antiparallel stacking of 343 KLDFKDR 349 through (1) van der Waals interactions between K 347 sidechains from each protofilament and (2) two pairs of hydrogen bonds between the ε-amino group of K 347 and the carboxyl group of D 348 and the backbone carbonyl of K 347 on the opposite protofilament ( Figure 2 B). This interface may be additionally stabilized by ubiquitination of K 353 ( Figures 2 B and 2C), because there is strong, large density in this region that may represent the C terminus of (mono/poly)-ubiquitin chains ( Figure 6 A). Much like the CBD singlet fibril, the doublet fibril shows strong, large extra densities connected to K 321 and K 353 , which can accommodate a terminal 76 GG 75 ubiquitin fragment. Interestingly, there is no additional density connected to K 343 ( Figure 6 A) in the doublet map, suggesting that these sites may not be highly ubiquitinated in this ultrastructural polymorph ( Figure 6 B).
In comparison, the asymmetric packing of the straight filament formed by tau in AD ( Falcon et al., 2018b; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 21. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Schweighauser, M. ... Tau filaments from multiple cases of sporadic and inherited Alzheimer’s disease adopt a common fold Acta Neuropathol. 2018; 136 :699-708 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ) is mediated by a region of additional density that is connected to the K 317/321 lysine side chains on both protofilaments ( Figure 6 C). The nature of this stabilizing interaction was previously unknown, and it has been postulated that this density may be composed of 7 EFE 9 because it interacts with K 317 and K 321, potentially forming salt bridges that link the distal end of the N terminus with the filament core ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; Goedert et al., 2018 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar 29.

Biol. 2018; 83 :163-171 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that an extended 7 EFE 9 structure cannot fit into this inter-protofilament interface without causing steric clashes ( Boyer and Eisenberg, 2019 6. Boyer, D. ∙ Eisenberg, D.S. A structure-based model for the electrostatic interaction of the N-terminus of protein tau with the fibril core of Alzheimer’s disease filaments Alzheimers Dement. 2019; 15 :321 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ). Based on our MS findings, we are able to build a C-terminal 76 GG 75 ubiquitin fragment covalently attached to the ε-NH 2 group of K 317 via an isopeptide bond into this previously unknown density ( Figure S6 ). This atomic model implies that the binding interface between protofilaments in AD straight filaments may be stabilized by additional interactions with the C terminus of the ubiquitin chain.

Section: Discussion

By comparing the structures of posttranslationally modified tau filaments in CBD and AD, we identify many common structural elements ( Figure 3 ) as well as both shared and distinct PTMs ( Figure S4 ; Tables S1 and S2 ). The picture that emerges is that the β strand-forming motifs in the two diseases are highly similar, but their misfolding and self-assembly into fibrils is radically different ( Figures 4 A and 4B). This diversity is facilitated by the loops and turns adopted by glycine and proline residues, which can accommodate myriad inter-sheet packings of the β strand building blocks. The unusually high percentage of glycine residues in the fibril-forming cores in CBD (12.1%) and AD (13.0%) points to their critical role in allowing β strands to flex and turn. Each tau repeat contains a PGGG motif that can adopt a compact turn or an extended conformation ( Figures 2 and 3 ) ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ), enabling the tandem repeats R1–R4 to adopt an almost continuous β strand architecture. Valine makes up over 10% of the fibril cores in CBD and AD, and together with isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine, these hydrophobic residues (FILV) stabilize most of the inter-sheet interfaces through clustering, aliphatic stacking, and aromatic stacking. Distinct FILV clusters can be identified in CBD and AD fibril cores ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ), cementing the closest sheet-sheet interactions between β strands ( Figure 2 C). The inclusion of R2 in the CBD tau fibril core radically alters inter-β sheet contacts ( Figures 4 A, 4 B, and S3 ), resulting in a strain distinct from other tauopathies ( Falcon et al., 2018a, 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Falcon, B. ∙ Zivanov, J. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Novel tau filament fold in chronic traumatic encephalopathy encloses hydrophobic molecules Nature. 2019; 568 :420-423 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The singlet and doublet fibrils formed by tau in CBD contain a small molecule buried within a large, hydrophilic cavity that may stabilize the CBD fold during fibril nucleation and/or templated seeding. The cavity is defined by three lysines (K 290 , K 294 , K 370 ) and a buried histidine (H 362 ), all pointing toward this additional, organic density ( Figure 2 ). To charge-compensate the spatially proximal lysine sidechains, this density may represent a small molecule with a net charge of −3 per rung of the protofilament. The size of the negatively charged small molecule is approximately 9 Å × 4 Å ( Figures 2 , 5 A, and 6 A), with near-stoichiometric occupancy so that it corresponds to a minimum volume of 170 Å 3 . Assuming an average density of organic compounds to be 1 g/cm 3 , the unknown molecule has an estimated molecular weight with a lower bound of 100 Da (or roughly the average size of an amino acid).
Although it was not possible to identify this small molecule using cryo-EM or MS, it appears to be most strongly connected to H 362 ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and 5 A). Solvent-exposed extra densities conjugated to the H 362 sidechain appear in cryo-EM maps of tau filaments in AD ( Figure 6 C) and CTE ( Falcon et al., 2019 22. Falcon, B. ∙ Zivanov, J. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Novel tau filament fold in chronic traumatic encephalopathy encloses hydrophobic molecules Nature. 2019; 568 :420-423 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ), but not in PiD ( Falcon et al., 2018a 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas in CBD, this additional density is buried within the core of the filament, forming part of the internal structure ( Figures 2 , 5 A, and 6 A). We do not see phosphorylation or methylation of H 362 in tau filaments from CBD or AD by MS ( Figure 3 ). However, given that there appears to be a large, negatively charged molecule conjugated to H 362 in tau filaments from CBD ( Figures 2 , 5 A, and 6 A), it is possible that this density corresponds to an ADP-ribose moiety or N-linked glycan. It is important to note that poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathological aggregation of α-synuclein, accelerating fibrillization and converting it into a more toxic α-synuclein strain ( Kam et al., 2018 38. Kam, T.-I. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Park, H. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease Science. 2018; 362 :eaat8407 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, tau is N-glycosylated in AD brain, but not in healthy brain ( Wang et al., 1996 68. Wang, J.Z. ∙ Grundke-Iqbal, I. ∙ Iqbal, K. Glycosylation of microtubule-associated protein tau: an abnormal posttranslational modification in Alzheimer’s disease Nat. Med. 1996; 2 :871-875 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ), and studies have shown not only that glycans modulate tau aggregation ( Losev et al., 2019 49. Losev, Y. ∙ Paul, A. ∙ Frenkel-Pinter, M. ... Novel model of secreted human tau protein reveals the impact of the abnormal N-glycosylation of tau on its aggregation propensity Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :2254 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also that deglycosylation alters tau paired helical filament structure by promoting its morphological transition toward straight filaments ( Wang et al., 1996 68. Wang, J.Z. ∙ Grundke-Iqbal, I. ∙ Iqbal, K. Glycosylation of microtubule-associated protein tau: an abnormal posttranslational modification in Alzheimer’s disease Nat. Med. 1996; 2 :871-875 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has also been reported that small, negatively charged molecules, such as ATP, can trigger the aggregation of 4R tau and, in a concentration-dependent manner, modulate the formation of singlet and doublet fibrils ( Farid et al., 2014 23. Farid, M. ∙ Corbo, C.P. ∙ Alonso, Adel.C. Tau binds ATP and induces its aggregation Microsc. Res. Tech. 2014; 77 :133-137 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the possibility that additional co-factors may help shape the protein fold of distinct strains in multiple tauopathies.
In this work, and consistent with other studies ( Falcon et al., 2018a, 2019; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019b 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Falcon, B. ∙ Zivanov, J. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Novel tau filament fold in chronic traumatic encephalopathy encloses hydrophobic molecules Nature. 2019; 568 :420-423 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar 74. Zhang, W. ∙ Tarutani, A. ∙ Newell, K.L. ... Novel tau filament fold in corticobasal degeneration, a four-repeat tauopathy bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), it has been found that each tauopathy is associated with a disease-specific tau protofilament, which packs together predominantly in one of two ways to form a fibril. Many of these ultrastructural polymorphs exhibit packing between protofilaments that, in the absence of a small ligand or PTM, is extremely weak, with few tau protein backbone or direct sidechain contacts between protofilaments to stabilize the fibrillar structure ( Iadanza et al., 2018a, 2018b 34. Iadanza, M.G. ∙ Jackson, M.P. ∙ Hewitt, E.W. ... A new era for understanding amyloid structures and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :755-773 Crossref Scopus (598) PubMed Google Scholar 35. Iadanza, M.G. ∙ Silvers, R. ∙ Boardman, J. ... The structure of a β 2 -microglobulin fibril suggests a molecular basis for its amyloid polymorphism Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4517 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The straight filament in AD has no salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, or hydrophobic packing holding the two protofilaments together ( Figure S6 B), and tau molecules in mating protofilaments form small interfaces with each other (82 Å 2 per inter-protofilament β strand contact). By cryo-EM ( Figures 6 C, S6 B, and S6 C) and MS ( Figure 3 ), we find that the C terminus of ubiquitin stabilizes the inter-protofilament interface in straight tau filaments from AD, suggesting that mono- and poly-ubiquitin chains form a stable and critical component of the fibril core ( Figure 6 D).
The two protofilaments in doublet fibrils formed by tau in CBD are only connected via two bifurcated hydrogen bonds ( Figure 2 B), which are ∼50% weaker than canonical hydrogen bonds ( Feldblum and Arkin, 2014 25. Feldblum, E.S. ∙ Arkin, I.T. Strength of a bifurcated H bond Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :4085-4090 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ) with few interfacial tau-tau contacts (63 Å 2 per inter-protofilament β strand contact). Given that there are intense, non-tau densities near K 353 at the inter-protofilament interface of doublet fibrils in CBD ( Figures 2 B, 2 C, and 6 A), similar in size to those found at K 311 and K 317/321 in straight filaments in AD ( Figure 6 C), we speculate that mono- and poly-ubiquitin chains may also play a structural role in stabilizing this ultrastructural polymorph ( Figure 6 B).
We propose a structure-based model in which the incorporation of ubiquitin into tau filaments in CBD and AD mediates specific inter-protofilament packing, resulting in distinct ultrastructural polymorphs ( Figure 7 ). Ubiquitination may help stabilize inter-protofilament packing by providing additional contacts between tau molecules in each protofilament via ubiquitin chains, thereby favoring the formation of these fibril subtypes ( Figure 7 ). Not only do mono- and poly-ubiquitination between the protofilaments add considerably more interfacial contacts, but they also increase the likelihood of sidechain-backbone and sidechain-sidechain hydrogen bonding between tau protofilaments and ubiquitin molecules. This may also be the case for other tau filaments such as the wide PiD filament ( Falcon et al., 2018a 20. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Structures of filaments from Pick’s disease reveal a novel tau protein fold Nature. 2018; 561 :137-140 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar ), which also has a remarkably weak inter-protofilament packing (only 38 Å 2 per inter-protofilament β strand contact) ( Iadanza et al., 2018b 35. Iadanza, M.G. ∙ Silvers, R. ∙ Boardman, J. ... The structure of a β 2 -microglobulin fibril suggests a molecular basis for its amyloid polymorphism Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4517 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may be additionally stabilized by ubiquitinated K 311 , K 317 , K 321 , and K 331 sites in the immediate vicinity of the interface between protofilaments.
By contrast, if sites on tau critical to the formation of straight filaments in AD (K 311 and K 317/321 ) or doublet fibrils in CBD (K 353 ) are acetylated, or ubiquitinated with low occupancy, the singlet fibril in CBD ( Figures 5 A and 5B) and paired helical filaments in AD ( Figure S6 A) adopt structures that do not require mediation by non-tau components at the inter-protofilament interface. The singlet fibril in CBD exists as a single protofilament ( Figures 2 , 5 A, and 5 B), and the paired helical filament has a strong, hexagonal hydrogen bonding network between its two protofilaments ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ). AD cases typically have a preponderance of paired helical filaments over straight filaments, but this ratio varies between patients and brain regions ( Crowther, 1991; Falcon et al., 2018b 12. Crowther, R.A. Straight and paired helical filaments in Alzheimer disease have a common structural unit Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88 :2288-2292 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar 21. Falcon, B. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Schweighauser, M. ... Tau filaments from multiple cases of sporadic and inherited Alzheimer’s disease adopt a common fold Acta Neuropathol. 2018; 136 :699-708 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). In CBD, we observe a ratio of singlet to doublet fibrils of approximately 1:2, but the inverse has also been reported ( Ksiezak-Reding et al., 1996 46. Ksiezak-Reding, H. ∙ Tracz, E. ∙ Yang, L.S. ... Ultrastructural instability of paired helical filaments from corticobasal degeneration as examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149 :639-651 PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that the variation in fibril subtype populations may be mediated by cross-talk between PTMs, with ubiquitination at the inter-protofilament interface being a key modulator of ultrastructural polymorphism ( Figure 7 ). The outcome of this structure-based model would be that neuronal inclusions and astrocytic plaques in CBD ( Dickson et al., 2011 15. Dickson, D.W. ∙ Kouri, N. ∙ Murray, M.E. ... Neuropathology of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau (FTLD-tau) J. Mol. Neurosci. 2011; 45 :384-389 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ) and neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in AD ( Bloom, 2014 5. Bloom, G.S. Amyloid-β and tau: the trigger and bullet in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis JAMA Neurol. 2014; 71 :505-508 Crossref Scopus (1324) PubMed Google Scholar ) have a mixture of fibril subtypes whose populations are modulated by PTMs ( Figure 7 ).
As the most abundant amino acid in the fibril cores of CBD and AD is lysine (15.9% and 14.3%, respectively), which makes acetylation or ubiquitination of tau highly likely ( Kontaxi et al., 2017; Park et al., 2018; Petrucelli et al., 2004 44. Kontaxi, C. ∙ Piccardo, P. ∙ Gill, A.C. Lysine-Directed Post-translational Modifications of Tau Protein in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Tauopathies Front. Mol.

Genet. 2004; 13 :703-714 Crossref Scopus (621) PubMed Google Scholar ), it should be possible to systematically test in vitro whether PTMs are molecular determinants that favor specific ultrastructural polymorphs during nucleation and growth of tau filaments. In this vein, recent studies show distinct differences in aggregation kinetics, preferential proteasomal degradation, and filament structure between ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated repeats R1–R4 of tau and α-synuclein ( Haj-Yahya et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2019 31.

N-Terminal Ubiquitination of Amyloidogenic Proteins Triggers Removal of Their Oligomers by the Proteasome Holoenzyme J. Mol. Biol. 2019; Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar ). However, considering that heparin-induced recombinant tau filaments have been shown to form different structures than brain-derived tau filaments ( Zhang et al., 2019a 73. Zhang, W. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ Murzin, A.G. ... Heparin-induced tau filaments are polymorphic and differ from those in Alzheimer’s and Pick’s diseases eLife. 2019; 8 :e43584 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ), such studies would require extensive optimization and validation to assess and ensure filament morphology accurately recapitulated brain-derived tau filaments. As such, our hybrid method of combining cryo-EM and MS of tau filaments from postmortem tissue is the most direct approach to elucidate the critical relationship between PTMs and fibril structure. This linkage is crucial to understanding fibril nucleation ( Haj-Yahya et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2019 31. Haj-Yahya, M. ∙ Fauvet, B. ∙ Herman-Bachinsky, Y. ...

In conclusion, we have identified the importance of PTMs in mediating the distinct structures of tau fibrils in CBD and AD. This is consistent with the likelihood that PTMs are central to tauopathies and, given the long-lived nature of other proteins found aggregated in brains ( Truscott et al., 2016 66. Truscott, R.J.W. ∙ Schey, K.L. ∙ Friedrich, M.G. Old Proteins in Man: A Field in its Infancy Trends Biochem.

We propose that our approach of combining cryo-EM with MS-based proteomics forms a methodological blueprint to fully decipher the role of PTMs in neurodegeneration.

Human brain samples were collected under a Mayo Clinic IRB-approved autopsy protocol. Tissues were de-identified prior to use, with no identifiers to patient names linked to brain samples. Patient confidentiality is strictly kept. As such, the utilization of autopsy-derived, de-identified human brain tissue in the current study is exempt from IRB regulations. All tissue was handled with universal precautions. For human postmortem brain tissue requests from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank, see https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-neuroscience-florida/brain-bank .
The patient was a 61-year-old woman with no family history of neurological disease. She had a five-year history of progressive aphasia as well as behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia characterized by impulse control disorder, antisocial behavior, hoarding disorder, and an inability to perform household tasks. Upon neurological examination, the patient exhibited flat effect, speech latency, and simplistic speech output. She was unable to perform simple calculations such as serial 7’s and demonstrated markedly slow motor responses. Her memory remained relatively intact. Formal neuropsychological testing showed deficits in processing speed and set-shifting. She was severely impaired on a card sorting test as well as tests of semantic and letter fluency. Magnetic resonance imaging scans exhibited mild ventricular enlargement and mild cortical atrophy. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography spectroscopy showed bilateral decreased uptake in medial and inferior frontal cortices and anterior cingulate gyri as well as asymmetrical uptake in left middle frontal and sensorimotor cortices. Upon progression of the disease, patient developed severe aphasia and became limited to simple one-word responses.
During autopsy, the brain was cleaved in half. The left half was frozen, whereas the right hemibrain was dissected. The calculated whole brain weight equaled 1080 g. The sulci and gyri revealed circumscribed cortical atrophy most marked in superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and opercular portion of inferior frontal gyrus. Medial temporal lobe structures were unremarkable. Coronal sections of the brain showed marked enlargement of frontal and temporal horns of the lateral ventricle. There was mild atrophy of the caudate nucleus and the dorsomedial thalamus. The substantia nigra had mild decreased pigmentation. Histologic studies of the frontal lobe, especially the superior frontal gyrus, revealed cortical atrophy with spongiosis, gliosis, and ballooned neurons. Ballooned neurons were most numerous in superior frontal and cingulate gyri. Tau immunohistochemistry showed extensive neuronal and glial tau pathology as well as numerous neuropil threads in gray and white matter of cortical and subcortical structures. Cortical and subcortical neuronal inclusions were pleomorphic, with many astrocytic plaques in affected cortices of the frontal lobe and the striatum. The pathology was an archetypal example of CBD. No Alzheimer-type pathology was observed (Braak stage I, Thal phase 0).
This 58-year-old white man developed progressive difficulty speaking and moving four years before he died. He became argumentative, and he showed poor judgement. This was followed by increasing apathy. He had a neurologic work-up, including MRI brain scan and an EEG, which were unrevealing. His progressive language problems were characterized by delays in responding and word finding difficulties. He developed obsessive behaviors, such as checking door locks and excessive hand washing. He showed decreased concern for personal hygiene. He had no significant past medical history, and his family history was negative for neurologic disease. On neurologic examination, he had latency to initiate speech and slow speech. He had no speech apraxia. He was fully oriented. He scored 29/30 on the Mini-Mental State Exam. His cranial nerve examination was normal except for mild masked facies, slow saccades in the vertical plane and hypophonia. His general motor examination was notable for increased tone in the extremities and slowing on finger tapping. There were no abnormal reflexes. He scored high on the Geriatric Depression Scale. Neuropsychologic testing was notable for mild dementia (Dementia Rating Scale-2 = 114/144) with decreases in word fluency, verbal memory, visual learning and executive dysfunction. He had progressive neurological decline with features of frontal executive dysfunction, behavioral and personality changes, as well as Parkinsonism with slurred speech. The major differential diagnosis was frontotemporal dementia versus progressive supranuclear palsy.
The fixed brain weight was 1140 g. The cerebral hemisphere had mild atrophy over the frontal convexity, most marked in the parasagittal and medial superior frontal gyrus. The medial temporal lobe was free of atrophy. Coronal sections revealed mild enlargement of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. The basal ganglia were unremarkable and the subthalamic nucleus had mild atrophy. There was marked pigment loss in the substantia nigra. Histologic sections showed cortical atrophy with spongiosis, gliosis, and ballooned neurons, most marked in superior frontal and cingulate gyri. There were no Alzheimer-type lesions with thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy, only isolated medial temporal neurofibrillary tangles (Braak NFT Stage 1, Thal amyloid phase 0). Tau immunohistochemistry showed neuronal and glial tauopathy consistent with cortical basal degeneration, including ballooned cortical neurons, many neuropil threads, pleomorphic small neuronal inclusions, and ballooned neurons in the limbic and frontal lobes.
This 68-year-old man had a 12-year history of progressive cognitive impairment with anxiety and behavioral disturbance, characterized by agitation and aggression. He was unable to remain gainfully employed. He previously worked as a cable splicer for a telephone company. He was involuntarily institutionalized several times due to behavioral problems. He was treated with Clonazepam, Namenda, Risperdal, trazadone, and Effexor. There was no family history of neurologic disorder. His review of systems was unremarkable. His general neurological exam was within normal limits, except for disorientation and severe memory deficits, especially affecting short term memory. There were no motor signs or symptoms. Neuroimaging studies ( Figure S5 ) showed sulcal enlargement and dilated ventricles consistent with brain atrophy but no focal lesions. At autopsy, his brain weighed 1040 g (normal lower limit for men: 1200 g). There was severe Alzheimer-type pathology (Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage - VI, Thal amyloid phase - 5, CERAD neuritic plaque score - frequent). There were no Lewy bodies.
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions. Antigen retrieval was performed by steaming in distilled water for 30 min. Sections were then immunostained with CP13 or PHF1 (tau phospho-specific antibodies provided by Dr. Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) using the DAKO Autostainer (Universal Staining System) and the DAKO EnVision + HRP system. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through a series of ethanol and xylene washes, and coverslipped with Cytoseal mounting media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc).
Frozen CBD and AD tissue from the medial frontal cortex were homogenized separately in 10 volumes (w/v) of cold buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), 80 mM NaCI, 1 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Dithiothreitol, and a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The homogenized samples were split into aliquots and ultracentrifuged for 40 min at 4°C in a TLA110 rotor at 60,000 rpm. The pellets were resuspended in one volume of cold buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.85 M NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mM EGTA), and subsequently ultracentrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with sarkosyl at a final concentration of 1% (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature with continuous agitation. Following this incubation, the samples were ultracentrifuged for 40 min at 4°C in a TLA110 rotor at 60,000 rpm. The pellets (P3 fraction) were saved as the sarkosyl-insoluble material, which was snap frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. Western blot using tau antibodies PHF1 (pS396/404), Tau46 (aa404-441), 12E8 (pS262, pS356), E1 (aa19-33), and CP13 (pS202) was utilized to evaluate sarkosyl-insoluble tau from the CBD samples.
Sarkosyl-insoluble material was resuspended in TBS, and following determination of tau concentrations, 50 ng tau from each sample was incubated in the presence or absence of pronase (Millipore) at 37°C. Protease inhibitor cocktail was then added to stop the reaction at either 1, 2, or 5 min. Pronase-treated and untreated samples were then spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane to evaluate immunoreactivity for ubiquitin and tau antibodies. Briefly, dot blots were washed in TBS plus 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X (TBS-T) and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies, Ubi-1, E1 (aa19-33), CP13 (pS202), 12E8, PHF1, and Tau46 (aa404-441). The following day, blots were washed in TBS-T, incubated with donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour, and again washed with TBS-T. Protein expression was then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence treatment and exposure to film.
Sarkosyl-insoluble material was resuspended in PBS and adsorbed onto carbon/formvar-coated 400 mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 90 s. The grids were washed two times in TBS buffer, and blocked with 1 mg/mL BSA (w/v) in TBS buffer for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Tau antibodies, E1 (aa19-33), Tau46 (aa404-441), and CP13 (pS202) as well as tau phospho-specific antibodies, PHF1 and 12E8, and a ubiquitin-specific antibody, Ubi-1, were used as primary antibodies. Primary antibody was applied (1:50 dilution in 1 mg/mL BSA (w/v) in TBS) for 1 hour and then washed three times in TBS buffer. Secondary gold-conjugated antibody was applied (1:20 dilution in 1 mg/mL BSA (w/v) in TBS) for 45 min and washed 6 times with TBS buffer. Grids were then stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 60 s and examined with a Philips 208S electron microscope (Philips, Hillsboro, OR).
Glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh) with 3 μL aliquots of purified tau filaments from CBD (< 0.1 mg/mL) or AD (1 mg/mL) were blotted with filter paper to remove excess sample. Using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV, grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane and then imaged using an FEI Titan Krios at 300 kV with a Gatan K2 Summit detector in counting mode. Inelastically scattered electrons were removed with a GIF-quantum energy filter (Gatan) set at a slit width of 20 eV. Movie frames were recorded with an exposure time of 200 ms at a dose rate of 1.5 electrons per Å 2 per frame for a total dose of 60 electrons per Å 2 at a pixel size of 1.06 Å. The resulting datasets comprised of 30,804 micrographs of tau fibrils in CBD and 20,382 micrographs of tau fibrils in AD, both with defocus values ranging from −1.0 to −3.0 μm.
Movie frames were gain-corrected, aligned, dose-weighted, and then summed into a single micrograph using MOTIONCOR2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 75. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ). The micrographs were used to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) using Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 72. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2309) PubMed Google Scholar ). All subsequent image-processing steps were performed using helical reconstruction methods in RELION ( He and Scheres, 2017 32. He, S. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. Helical reconstruction in RELION J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 198 :163-176 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) as previously described ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor changes as outlined below.
Fibrils were manually selected and separated into doublet and singlet populations based on maximum width. Since we collected data on CBD fibrils at four separate cryo-EM facilities, we down-scaled all fibrils to a pixel size of 1.414 Å to mitigate the effect of small variations in magnification on different microscopes. Initial models of the fibril subtypes were generated from pitch-views of the filaments, using an elongated ribbon as a starting reference. Using these initial models, 3D classification with T = 50 was used to refine a doublet fibril with a helical twist of −0.6° and rise of 4.8 Å, consistent with an average crossover distance of approximately 1,300 Å. The doublet showed a clear 2-fold symmetry, and this was enforced, resulting in higher resolution. Refinement with C1 symmetry left the extra densities decorating the fibril unchanged from the C2-refinement. The singlet was refined with a helical twist of −0.85° and rise of 4.8 Å, consistent with an average crossover distance of approximately 1,050 Å. Both maps were 3D autorefined and postprocessed in RELION ( He and Scheres, 2017 32. He, S. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. Helical reconstruction in RELION J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 198 :163-176 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). AD fibrils were processed in a manner identical to ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a helical twist of 179.42° and rise of 2.35 Å. Final overall resolution estimates of 3.8 Å (Doublet Fibril), 4.3 Å (Singlet Fibril), and 3.3 Å (Paired Helical Filament) were calculated from Fourier shell correlations at 0.143 between the two independently refined half-maps ( Chen et al., 2013 9. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution estimates were displayed using Resmap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 47. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1285) PubMed Google Scholar ).
K 274 -E 380 was built by manually adding amino acids into the doublet fibril map, followed by real-space refinement in COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 18. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19617) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, a combination of the sharpened and masked singlet fibril and doublet fibril maps was used to trace a polyalanine chain into one rung of the protofilament density. Next, backbone geometries were refined using COOT, and sidechains K 281 -V 363 were added and real-space refined into the density. The extended conformation of 332 PGGG 335 and 364 PGGG 367 was initially modeled using the polyglycine II region from PDB-entry 5O3L. N- and C-terminal β strands were initially modeled using V 275 -K 280 from PDB-entry 5V5C (β1) and N 368 -F 378 from PDB-entry 5O3L (β11). A protein stack consisting of three identical rungs (chains E, F, and G) separated by 4.8 Å was assembled, and this protofilament was fitted into the doublet map using CHIMERA ( Pettersen et al., 2004 59. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32501) PubMed Google Scholar ). A second copy of this protofilament (chains A, B, and C) was made and fitted into the C2-related protofilament density in the doublet map, making a total of 6 chains. For the doublet fibril structure, we used phenix.real_space_refine for model refinement ( Afonine et al., 2018 2. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1392) PubMed Google Scholar ). Secondary structure, non-crystallographic symmetry, and hydrogen bond restraints were applied during refinement. The final doublet fibril model was validated using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 8. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (10875) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction of the singlet fibril is 4.3 Å, one protofilament of the doublet atomic model (chains E, F, and G) was rigid-body fitted into this map in CHIMERA. Paired helical filaments were built and refined in an identical manner to ( Fitzpatrick et al., 2017 28. Fitzpatrick, A.W.P. ∙ Falcon, B. ∙ He, S. ... Cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2017; 547 :185-190 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the exception that covalent linkages to 76 GG 75 have been incorporated into our atomic models at K 317 using isopeptide bond-length restraints in Phenix ( Afonine et al., 2018 2. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1392) PubMed Google Scholar ), in accordance with our MS results. Straight filament structures were similarly refined into the cryo-EM map EMD-0260. Acetylation of lysines to generate Figure 4 D was performed using a plugin ( Warnecke et al., 2014 69. Warnecke, A. ∙ Sandalova, T. ∙ Achour, A. ... PyTMs: a useful PyMOL plugin for modeling common post-translational modifications BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :370 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ) for PyMOL ( Schrödinger, 2017 60. Schrödinger, L.L.C. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 2017 Google Scholar ). Interfacial surface areas were calculated using the PISA server ( Krissinel and Henrick, 2007 45. Krissinel, E. ∙ Henrick, K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 :774-797 Crossref Scopus (7514) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Insoluble protein fractions (P3) were resuspended in 8 M urea buffer and digested overnight with endopeptidase LysC and trypsin at a 1:10 protease:substrate ratio as previously described ( Higginbotham et al., 2019 33.

Peptide samples were resuspended in loading buffer (0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 0.03% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 1% (v/v) acetonitrile) and loaded onto a 20-cm column (internal diameter, 75 μm) packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9-μm beads (Dr. Maisch) and eluted over a 2-h 1%–50% buffer B reverse-phase gradient (buffer A, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 1% (v/v) acetonitrile in water; buffer B, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile) generated by an Easy nLC UPLC system (Thermo). Peptides were ionized with 2.4-kV electrospray ionization voltage from a nano-ESI source (Thermo) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo). For samples analyzed in high resolution MS1 and MS2 scans, data-dependent acquisition of MS1 spectra were collected at 120,000 resolution (FWHM), and MS/MS spectra were collected in the Orbitrap at 15,000 resolution (FWHM) after higher energy dissociation (HCD) and/or electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) in a decision tree method ( Swaney et al., 2008 63. Swaney, D.L. ∙ McAlister, G.C. ∙ Coon, J.J. Decision tree-driven tandem mass spectrometry for shotgun proteomics Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :959-964 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ) or ETD supplemental activation with high energy (EThcD). For the first CBD case (CBD1) two MS runs were performed. The first with EThcD and HCD decision tree (CBD1_a), whereas a second run utilized ETD and HCD decision tree (CBD1_b) for MS/MS analyses. The second CBD case (CBD2_a) was analyzed using only EThcD and HCD decision tree for MS/MS analyses. The AD case (AD1) was analyzed with EThcD and HCD decision tree for MS/MS (AD1_a). A second analysis was also performed with ETD and HCD decision tree (AD1_b) for MS/MS analyses in which the product ions were detected in the ion trap. Raw data was deposited on ProteomeXchange (Project Accession # PXD016862). LC-MS/MS of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from two pools of CBD (3 cases each pool) was performed on an Orbitrap-XL mass spectrometer as previously described ( Bai et al., 2013 3. Bai, B. ∙ Hales, C.M. ∙ Chen, P.C. ... U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex and RNA splicing alterations in Alzheimer’s disease Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :16562-16567 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ) and raw data downloaded from www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2397898
To identify tau peptides, Proteome Discoverer 2.3 was used to search and match MS/MS spectra to the human proteome database downloaded August 2019 from UniProt containing both Swissprot and TrEMBL entries (96,069 target entries) with a ± 10-ppm mass-accuracy threshold on the precursor. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages was set in the search, with variable modifications including phosphorylation (S/T/Y, +79.9663 Da), lysine ubiquitination (K, +114.0429 Da), acetylation (N-term/K, +42.420106 Da), arginine and lysine mono-/di-methylation (R/K, +14.0157/28.0313 Da), and methionine oxidation (M, +15.9949 Da). Fixed modifications included carbamidomethylation on cysteine (C, +57.0215 Da). A separate search was performed to map lysine mono-/di-/tri-methylation (K, +14.0157/28.0313/42.046950 Da) sites with a product ion mass tolerance of 0.02 Da. No tri-methylated lysine peptides were identified on tau. Thus, lysine tri-methylation was not included in the global PTM search on the same raw files in which the product ion mass tolerance was set to 0.05 Da for MS/MS data collected at high resolution. For AD1_b, the product ion mass tolerance was set to 0.6 Da for MS/MS data collected at low resolution in the ion-trap. Data from the CBD pools were searched with the same dynamic and fixed modifications described above with a ± 50-ppm mass-accuracy threshold on the precursor ion and product ion mass tolerance set at 0.6 Da for MS/MS data collected in the ion-trap. Percolator was used to filter the peptide spectral matches (PSM) in each sample to a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 1%. All MS/MS spectra for putative Tau PTMs were manually inspected. The mass spectrometry proteomics data generated in this study have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository ( Perez-Riverol et al., 2019 56.

To approximate the effects of the acetylation of lysine residues in 4-repeat tau, we calculated its solubility before and after employing the K→Q mimic ( Kamieniarz and Schneider, 2009 39. Kamieniarz, K. ∙ Schneider, R. Tools to tackle protein acetylation Chem. Biol. 2009; 16 :1027-1029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the CamSol method ( Sormanni et al., 2015 62. Sormanni, P. ∙ Aprile, F.A. ∙ Vendruscolo, M. The CamSol method of rational design of protein mutants with enhanced solubility J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427 :478-490 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion was used to estimate resolution of cryo-EM density maps.
The cryo-EM maps have been deposited to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/ ): accession numbers EMD-21200 for CBD doublet; EMD-21201 for CBD singlet; EMD-21207 for AD paired helical filament. The refined atomic models of the CBD fibrils and the AD paired helical filament have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (PDB; https://www.rcsb.org/ ): accession numbers PDB: 6VH7 for CBD doublet fibril; PDB: 6VHA for CBD singlet fibril; PDB: 6VHL for AD paired helical filament; PDB: 6VI3 for straight filament.
