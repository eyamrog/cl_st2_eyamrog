Title: The Intestinal Microbiome Restricts Alphavirus Infection and Dissemination through a Bile Acid-Type I IFN Signaling Axis


Abstract: Summary

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an emerging alphavirus, has infected millions of people. However, the factors modulating disease outcome remain poorly understood. Here, we show in germ-free mice or in oral antibiotic-treated conventionally housed mice with depleted intestinal microbiomes that greater CHIKV infection and spread occurs within 1 day of virus inoculation. Alteration of the microbiome alters TLR7-MyD88 signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and blunts systemic production of type I interferon (IFN). Consequently, circulating monocytes express fewer IFN-stimulated genes and become permissive for CHIKV infection. Reconstitution with a single bacterial species, Clostridium scindens , or its derived metabolite, the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid, can restore pDC- and MyD88-dependent type I IFN responses to restrict systemic CHIKV infection and transmission back to vector mosquitoes. Thus, symbiotic intestinal bacteria modulate antiviral immunity and levels of circulating alphaviruses within hours of infection through a bile acid-pDC-IFN signaling axis, which affects viremia, dissemination, and potentially transmission.

Section: Introduction

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that is maintained in an urban epidemic transmission cycle ( Higgs and Vanlandingham, 2015 30. Higgs, S. ∙ Vanlandingham, D.

Although most CHIKV infections cause an acute febrile illness lasting weeks, a subset progress to persistent musculoskeletal pain and inflammation lasting months to years ( Borgherini et al., 2008 4.

Moreover, despite causing millions of infections globally, no licensed vaccines or therapeutics exist.
The innate immune response controls CHIKV dissemination during the early stages of infection. CHIKV replication induces type I interferon (IFN) in the serum of human patients and experimentally infected mice ( Rudd et al., 2012 70. Rudd, P.A. ∙ Wilson, J. ∙ Gardner, J. ...

Mice deficient in the transcription factors that induce type I IFNs, or its signaling receptor, experience disseminated CHIKV infection and succumb rapidly ( Rudd et al., 2012 70.

Although bone marrow reconstitution studies demonstrate that type I IFN signaling in non-hematopoietic cells can prevent CHIKV-induced lethality, the cellular sources of IFN are less clear ( Cook et al., 2019 14.

Type I IFN controls chikungunya virus via its action on nonhematopoietic cells J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207 :429-442 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Experimentally enforced expression of IRF7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can control CHIKV infection by producing high levels of type I IFNs ( Webster et al., 2018 93.

Functional studies in mice and immune profiling of patients infected with CHIKV highlight phenotypic and transcriptional responses in monocyte subsets, which can control or contribute to pathogenesis depending on the stage of infection ( Gardner et al., 2010 26.

However, the immune cues and environmental factors that influence type I IFN signaling in monocytes and how this response impacts CHIKV dissemination remain unknown.

The microbial metabolite desaminotyrosine protects from influenza through type I interferon Science. 2017; 357 :498-502 Crossref Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a mechanistic understanding of the immune cells and signaling pathways linked to the microbiome and the identification of specific microorganisms that influence antiviral responses is lacking.
Here, we describe the impact of the mammalian intestinal microbiome on alphavirus infection and dissemination. CHIKV infection of oral Abx-treated or GF mice resulted in increased viral burden in blood and tissues distant from the site of inoculation. These phenotypes correlated with greater infection of circulating monocytes in microbiome-depleted mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of Abx-treated mice following CHIKV infection revealed diminished expression of ISGs in blood monocytes, and this was associated with reduced levels of type I IFN in serum. Differences in CHIKV tropism following microbiome depletion depended on TLR7 and MyD88 signaling in pDCs, which regulated systemic type I IFN production within hours of infection. Colonization of Abx-treated mice with a bile acid (BA)-transforming single bacterial species, Clostridium scindens , resulted in pDC- and MyD88-dependent type I IFN responses that controlled CHIKV infection. Exogenous administration of a secondary BA to Abx-treated, GF mice, or even untreated mice, recapitulated the MyD88- and pDC-dependent protection observed with C. scindens colonization. Thus, perturbations in the intestinal microbiome or reconstitution with even a single bacterial species can modulate rapid antiviral responses through an IFN-dependent immune axis between BA-transforming bacteria and pDCs.

Section: Results

To alter the composition of the intestinal bacterial microbiome in conventionally housed mice, animals received two oral Abx, ampicillin and vancomycin (AV), or vehicle for 3 days. Antibiotics were cleared after providing antibiotic-free drinking water for 3 days prior to subcutaneous inoculation in the foot with a clinical strain of CHIKV (La Reunion OPY1, 2006) ( Figure 1 A). Short-term AV treatment led to diminished fecal bacteria at the time of CHIKV inoculation ( Figure 1 B). Profound differences in bacterial community composition were observed between AV- and vehicle-treated mice with considerable changes in beta-diversity and alpha-diversity as measured by richness ( Figures S1 B–S1D).
Systemic CHIKV burden was greater in AV-treated than vehicle-treated mice as soon as 1 day post-infection (dpi). CHIKV titers were elevated in the serum and spleen, but not in the ipsilateral ankle adjacent to the inoculation site ( Figure 1 C). At 3 dpi, higher viral titers were detected in the serum, spleen, and contralateral ankle of AV-treated mice ( Figure 1 D); this pattern was associated with more persistence of CHIKV RNA in the spleen and contralateral ankle at 28 dpi ( Figure 1 E). Even though CHIKV titers were not increased in the ipsilateral ankle, we observed exacerbated joint swelling in AV-treated mice ( Figure 1 F). At 3 dpi, abundant viral RNA staining was observed in the red pulp of the spleen in AV-treated, but not vehicle-treated, mice ( Figure 1 G).
To test if these virological phenotypes were due to alterations of the intestinal microbiome, we performed microbial reconstitution studies. Fecal microbial transfers (FMTs) from Abx-naive, uninfected mice into AV-treated animals that were performed at 1 day post-Abx cessation (AV+FMTs) restored total fecal 16S rRNA copy number ( Figure 1 B) and partially reconstituted the enteric bacterial community composition at day 0 ( Figures S1 B–S1D). In Abx-treated mice, the effects of the FMT reversed CHIKV titer differences in the serum, spleen, and contralateral ankle ( Figures 1 C and 1E), and prevented the worsened joint swelling ( Figure 1 F).
To confirm a role for intestinal microbes in modulating CHIKV infection, we used a gnotobiotic mouse model. Non-colonized GF mice or GF mice colonized by FMTs from conventionally raised mice were inoculated with CHIKV. At 1 dpi, greater titers of CHIKV were detected in the serum and spleen of non-colonized GF mice than FMT-colonized GF mice, and no difference was observed in the ipsilateral ankle ( Figure 1 H). The concordance of findings in both GF and Abx-treated mice supports a role for the intestinal microbiome in modulating CHIKV infection at systemic sites, but not locally at the site of inoculation.
Given that AV-treated mice had increased viral RNA in the red pulp of the spleen, we hypothesized that an enhanced dissemination phenotype might be due to infection of circulating myeloid cells. Indeed, viral burden was greater in peripheral blood leukocytes (125-fold) than in cell-free plasma (13-fold) in AV-treated compared to vehicle-treated mice at 1 dpi ( Figures 2 A and 2B). We analyzed peripheral blood leukocytes by flow cytometry to define permissive subsets using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the CHIKV envelope proteins ( Figures S2 A and S2B). At 1 dpi, CD11b + CD115 + Ly6G – monocytes had the highest levels of CHIKV antigen on their surface. Although subsets of both classical (Ly6C hi CD43 − CCR2 + ) and patrolling (Ly6C lo CD43 + CCR2 − ) monocytes stained positively for viral antigens, only classical monocytes showed increased CHIKV antigen staining after AV treatment ( Figure 2 C). This phenotype also was observed in GF mice compared to FMT-colonized GF mice ( Figures 2 D–2F). Overall, in AV- and vehicle-treated mice, we observed no differences in the frequency or number of monocytes after CHIKV infection ( Figure S2 C).
Higher levels of CHIKV antigen on the surface of Ly6C hi monocytes could reflect bound or opsonized virus rather than productive infection. To address this issue, we utilized a CHIKV-GFP reporter virus in which GFP expression occurs only following translation and replication within the cell. GFP signal was detected in Ly6C hi monocytes from AV-treated but not vehicle-treated mice ( Figures 2 G and 2H). This experiment confirms productive monocyte infection following alteration of the intestinal microbiome.
To determine whether the enhanced infection of myeloid cells contributed to the increased viremia observed with AV treatment, we first depleted neutrophils and Ly6C hi monocytes with an anti-Ly6C/Ly6G mAb ( Czuprynski et al., 1994 16. Czuprynski, C.J. ∙ Brown, J.F. ∙ Maroushek, N. ... Administration of anti-granulocyte mAb RB6-8C5 impairs the resistance of mice to Listeria monocytogenes infection J. Immunol. 1994; 152 :1836-1846 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S3 A and S3B). In mice depleted of neutrophils and monocytes, viremia at 1 dpi in the AV-treated group normalized to those of vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 2 I). Depletion of Ly6C hi monocytes alone, but not neutrophils alone, resulted in viremia in AV-treated mice that normalized to vehicle-treated mice ( Figures 2 J, 2K, and S3 C–S3F). Thus, the microbiome modulates the permissiveness of Ly6C hi monocytes to CHIKV in blood, which affects viremia at early stages of infection.
To determine if alterations in the intestinal microbiome also impacted viral burden in Ly6C hi monocytes during infection by another arthritogenic alphavirus, we inoculated mice with Mayaro virus (MAYV). AV-treated mice also had higher levels of MAYV in serum and peripheral blood leukocytes at 1 dpi ( Figures S4 A and S4B) and greater amounts of MAYV antigen on the surface of monocytes ( Figure S4 C).
To define how the microbiome alters the susceptibility of monocytes to infection, we performed single-cell RNA-seq of peripheral blood leukocytes in vehicle- and AV-treated uninfected and CHIKV-infected (1 dpi) mice. We enriched for myeloid cells by negative selection using antibody-coated magnetic beads. Graph-based clustering and established cell-type markers identified transcriptional groups of leukocyte subpopulations ( Figure 3 A) including one B cell cluster, one T cell cluster, four clusters of blood monocytes, and smaller clusters of neutrophils and NK cells ( Figures S5 A–S5I). We detected large transcriptional changes after CHIKV infection with expansion of one blood monocyte cluster (termed cluster “1”; Figures 3 B and S5 J) that essentially was absent in uninfected mice and showed significant ISG upregulation following infection. Analysis of monocytes clusters at 1 dpi (clusters 1, 2, 5, and 8) derived from AV-treated mice showed transcriptional differences from vehicle-treated controls, with decreased expression of genes in the type I IFN response pathway including Irf7 and other canonical ISGs ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Analysis of monocyte clusters from naive mice showed smaller differences in ISG signature between cells from AV- and vehicle-treated mice prior to infection ( Figure S5 K). Cells in clusters 1 and 2 express Ly6c2 , Ccr2 , and Csf1r mRNA, which is consistent with the classical Ly6C hi monocyte subset that we identified as more permissive to alphavirus infection following AV treatment ( Figures S5 A–S5C). We confirmed decreased expression of selected ISGs in sorted Ly6C hi monocytes from AV-treated mice obtained 1 day after MAYV infection ( Figure 3 D). Thus, depletion of the intestinal microbiome results in diminished ISG induction in peripheral blood monocytes, which likely renders these cells permissive to alphavirus infection.
To establish whether microbiome-dependent differences in antiviral response were due to cell-intrinsic changes or altered environmental cues, we performed adoptive transfer experiments using donor monocytes harvested from AV- or vehicle-treated naive CCR2 + GFP + transgenic mice. GFP + monocytes were sorted and transferred to recipient AV- or vehicle-treated wild-type (WT) mice ( Figure 3 E). Sixteen hours later, recipient mice were inoculated with CHIKV, and viral antigen expression on peripheral blood leukocytes was measured. CCR2 + GFP + Ly6C hi CD11b + monocytes derived from AV-treated mice and transferred into AV-treated recipients showed greater CHIKV antigen staining than those derived from vehicle-treated mice and transferred into vehicle-treated recipients ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Transfer of CCR2 + GFP + monocytes from vehicle-treated mice into AV-treated recipients resulted in a higher frequency of CHIKV antigen-positive Ly6C hi monocytes. Reciprocally, when CCR2 + GFP + monocytes from AV-treated mice were transferred into vehicle-treated hosts, the frequency of CHIKV antigen-positive Ly6C hi monocytes was decreased. These results suggest that microbiome-dependent immune cues promote optimal antiviral responses in Ly6C hi monocytes to restrict alphavirus infection.
We hypothesized that other cell types might fail to produce type I IFN resulting in the diminished ISG response in Ly6C hi blood monocytes. Indeed, vehicle-treated mice at 1 dpi showed a robust type I IFN response in serum following CHIKV infection, whereas AV-treated mice did not ( Figure 3 H). Moreover, FMTs prior to CHIKV inoculation restored the type I IFN response of AV-treated mice to those of vehicle-treated animals. Analogously, GF mice inoculated with CHIKV also had markedly lower type I IFN levels in serum than FMT-colonized GF mice ( Figure 3 I).
Because of these results, we expected that the differences in viremia between AV- and vehicle-treated mice might be lost in Ifnar1 −/− mice. Despite a narrowing of the phenotype, small differences at 1 dpi remained between AV- and vehicle-treated mice. These data suggest that in addition to type I IFN, other antiviral pathways might be affected by AV treatment. We next tested Stat1 −/− mice, as STAT1 conveys signals downstream of type I, II (IFN-γ), and III (IFN-λ) receptor engagement. At 1 dpi, viremia was equivalent between AV-and vehicle-treated Stat1 −/− mice ( Figure 3 J). To define whether IFN-γ contributed to the normalized viremia in AV-treated Stat1 −/− mice, we treated Ifnar1 −/− mice with a blocking anti-IFN-γ mAb ( Harty et al., 1992 28. Harty, J.T. ∙ Schreiber, R.D. ∙ Bevan, M.J. CD8 T cells can protect against an intracellular bacterium in an interferon gamma-independent fashion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89 :11612-11616 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ); the addition of anti-IFN-γ mAb to Ifnar1 −/− mice abrogated the difference in viremia between AV- and vehicle-treated groups at 1 dpi and correspondingly, IFN-γ levels were reduced in the serum of AV-treated mice ( Figure 3 K). Last, following AV treatment, differences in viremia at 1 dpi were also lost in conditional knockout (KO) mice lacking Stat1 only in myeloid cells (LysM-Cre + Stat1 fl/fl ) when compared to littermate controls (Cre − Stat1 fl/fl ) ( Figure 3 L). Thus, viremia differences observed upon microbiome depletion depend on IFNs and Stat1 signaling in LysM + myeloid cells, which includes monocytes.
Because pDCs contribute to the early control of some viral infections ( Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007 9. Cervantes-Barragan, L. ∙ Züst, R. ∙ Weber, F. ... Control of coronavirus infection through plasmacytoid dendritic-cell-derived type I interferon Blood. 2007; 109 :1131-1137 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ; Swiecki et al., 2013 83. Swiecki, M. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Gilfillan, S. ... Plasmacytoid dendritic cells contribute to systemic but not local antiviral responses to HSV infections PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 :e1003728 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that these cells could regulate the systemic IFN response in our model. To test whether the microbiome alters pDC function to restrict CHIKV viremia at 1 dpi, we depleted these cells using an anti-PDCA-1 antibody ( Isaksson et al., 2009 38. Isaksson, M. ∙ Ardesjö, B. ∙ Rönnblom, L. ... Plasmacytoid DC promote priming of autoimmune Th17 cells and EAE Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39 :2925-2935 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S6 A and S6B). One day after treatment, we observed no differences in the frequency or number of other myeloid cell populations including monocytes and neutrophils ( Figure S6 C). Depletion of pDCs resulted in an increase in CHIKV viremia and infection of blood leukocytes in vehicle-treated mice ( Figures 4 A and 4B). However, in AV-treated mice, depletion of pDCs did not affect infection in serum, blood leukocytes, or Ly6C hi monocytes ( Figures 4 A–4C). Correspondingly, vehicle-treated mice that were depleted of pDCs had lower serum type I IFN levels than isotype mAb-treatment controls, but this effect was absent in AV-treated mice ( Figure 4 D). Thus, the production of type I IFN and restriction of systemic CHIKV infection was mediated at least in part by pDCs, and this was modulated by the intestinal microbiome.
To dissect how the intestinal microbiome alters the antiviral function of pDCs, we interrogated expression levels of 547 immune genes using the NanoString platform in sorted splenic pDCs immediately before (day 0) or 1 day after MAYV infection. Principal component analysis showed that at 0 dpi, AV- and vehicle-treated pDCs clustered together, suggesting a limited impact of the microbiome on pDC immune gene signatures at baseline ( Figure 4 E). In contrast, at 1 dpi, pDCs clustered by treatment group ( Figure 4 E), with those from AV-treated mice expressing fewer type I IFN response gene transcripts ( Figure 4 F). Unbiased hierarchal clustering of genes involved in IFN responses showed transcriptional differences between AV- and vehicle-treated mice at 1 dpi, but not at day 0 in genes involved in viral sensing (e.g., TLRs and Irf7 ) ( Figures 4 G and S6 D). Ifna1 and Ifna2 levels were similar between the two groups despite large transcriptional decreases in ISG expression. Because only Ifna and Ifna2 were included in the NanoString platform, we evaluated expression of Ifna4 , Ifna5 , and Ifna6 using qRT-PCR. Decreased (>10-fold) expression of Ifna5 and Ifna6 was observed in AV-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated controls ( Figure 4 H). These data show that the antiviral, but not basal, transcriptional immune response program of pDCs is altered by the intestinal microbiome.
pDCs can produce IFN-α independently of IRF3 signaling because of constitutive expression of IRF7 ( Honda et al., 2004 32. Honda, K. ∙ Yanai, H. ∙ Mizutani, T. ... Role of a transductional-transcriptional processor complex involving MyD88 and IRF-7 in Toll-like receptor signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :15416-15421 Crossref Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kerkmann et al., 2003 44. Kerkmann, M. ∙ Rothenfusser, S. ∙ Hornung, V. ... Activation with CpG-A and CpG-B oligonucleotides reveals two distinct regulatory pathways of type I IFN synthesis in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells J. Immunol. 2003; 170 :4465-4474 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the decreased expression levels of Irf7 , Ifna5 , and Ifna6 in pDCs of AV-treated mice, we inoculated AV- or vehicle-treated Irf7 −/− mice with CHIKV and measured viral burden in the serum. No difference in viremia of AV and vehicle-treated Irf7 −/− mice was observed ( Figure 4 I), which demonstrates that intestinal microbiome-mediated restriction of alphavirus infection depends on IRF7 expression. To determine whether the microbiome impacted IFN-α production in a cell-intrinsic manner, pDCs were sorted from naive AV- or vehicle-treated mice and stimulated ex vivo . Treatment of pDCs with ligands that induce type I IFN production (e.g., TLR7 (imiquimod) or TLR9 (CpG-A) agonists) but not nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent cytokines (e.g., CpG-B), resulted in decreased IFN-α but not interleukin (IL)-6 production from uninfected AV-treated compared to vehicle-treated mice ( Figures 4 J and 4K). Indeed, transcriptional differences in NF-κB-dependent cytokines were not observed in pDCs at 1 dpi between AV- and vehicle-treated groups ( Figure S6 E). These results demonstrate that type I IFN production in pDCs is modulated by the gut microbiome, but differences are observed only in response to specific inflammatory stimuli.
We evaluated whether specific pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway(s) mediated the microbiome-dependent restriction of CHIKV infection. We observed that CHIKV burden differences in the serum, peripheral blood leukocytes, and spleen were increased in Myd88 −/− vehicle-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated WT controls ( Figures 5 A–5C) but were equivalent between AV-treated WT and Myd88 −/− mice. Correspondingly, vehicle-treated Myd88 −/− mice had lower type I IFN levels in serum than WT mice, but this difference was lost in AV-treated WT and Myd88 −/− mice ( Figure 5 D).
We determined whether MyD88 signaling was required in pDCs for type I IFN production and control of CHIKV infection. Although multiple models of pDC ablation exist, a specific cell promoter for generating pDC conditional KO mice does not ( Swiecki et al., 2014 84. Swiecki, M. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Riboldi, E. ... Cell depletion in mice that express diphtheria toxin receptor under the control of SiglecH encompasses more than plasmacytoid dendritic cells J. Immunol. 2014; 192 :4409-4416 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). To circumvent this issue, we used mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras to ablate MyD88 expression specifically in pDCs. Transgenic BDCA-DTR mice express the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under the control of the highly specific, human pDC promoter, BDCA-2. Although the gene for BDCA-2 is not encoded in mice, the human promoter contains target sequences that are bound by mouse pDC-specific transcription factors. Administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) selectively ablates pDCs ( Swiecki et al., 2010 82. Swiecki, M. ∙ Gilfillan, S. ∙ Vermi, W. ... Plasmacytoid dendritic cell ablation impacts early interferon responses and antiviral NK and CD8(+) T cell accrual Immunity. 2010; 33 :955-966 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). BM from CD45.2 Myd88 −/− or CD45.2 WT controls and BDCA-DTR (CD45.1/2) mice were mixed (1:1) and used to reconstitute an irradiated CD45.1 WT recipient ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Following DT administration, selective ablation of BDCA-DTR pDCs (CD45.1/2) was established ( Figure 5 G) leaving Myd88 −/− pDCs along with a mixture of Myd88 −/− and Myd88 +/+ non-pDC hematopoietic cells in animals reconstituted with mixed BM from BDCA-DTR and Myd88 −/− mice.
BDCA-DTR: Myd88 −/− and BDCA-DTR: WT controls were treated with AV or vehicle alone, inoculated with CHIKV, and viral burden was measured. Similar to Myd88 −/− mice, animals reconstituted with BM from BDCA-DTR: Myd88 −/− donors and treated with vehicle had higher viral titers in the spleen and blood ( Figures 5 H and 5I) and greater viral antigen staining on LyC6 hi monocytes ( Figure 5 J) than mice receiving mixed BM from BDCA-DTR and WT animals. However, the differences in viral burden normalized between these two groups following AV treatment. These data indicate that a MyD88-dependent signaling pathway in pDCs integrates microbiome signals and antiviral responses following CHIKV infection.
Multiple TLRs signal through MyD88 ( Kawasaki and Kawai, 2014 43. Kawasaki, T. ∙ Kawai, T. Toll-like receptor signaling pathways Front. Immunol. 2014; 5 :461 Crossref Scopus (2312) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2010 47. Lin, S.-C. ∙ Lo, Y.-C. ∙ Wu, H. Helical assembly in the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex in TLR/IL-1R signalling Nature. 2010; 465 :885-890 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that engagement of specific MyD88-dependent TLRs could trigger systemic IFN responses to limit CHIKV infection in blood and prevent dissemination. We treated mice deficient in one of four TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, or TLR9) that use MyD88 as a signaling adaptor or their respective WT littermate controls with vehicle or AV and then inoculated them with CHIKV. At 1 dpi, no differences in viremia were present in vehicle-treated Tlr2 −/− , Tlr4 −/− , and Tlr9 −/− mice ( Figures 5 K, 5L, and 5N), indicating that signals from the gut microbiome do not require these TLRs to restrict CHIKV infection. In comparison, infection of vehicle-treated Tlr7 −/− mice resulted in increased viremia compared to WT littermate controls. This difference was not seen between AV-treated WT and Tlr7 −/− mice ( Figure 5 M), which is similar to the Myd88 −/− animals. These data suggest that the microbiome affects pDCs so they can respond rapidly to CHIKV in circulation through a TLR7 and MyD88-dependent signaling axis to generate a type I IFN response that limits monocyte infection and virus dissemination.
We investigated whether specific bacterial taxa or communities mediated the protective effect of the microbiota. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis, colonization of AV-treated mice with FMTs re-established microbial diversity ( Figure S1 ). However, the number of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that differed between the AV and AV+FMT fecal samples was too great to test for specific taxa ( Figures S1 B and S1C). To reduce the complexity, we inoculated mice with bulk anaerobically (ANA) cultured bacteria from our protective FMT stock. AV-treated mice receiving the FMT-derived anaerobic cultures (AV+ANA) showed enhanced viral dissemination following CHIKV infection ( Figure 6 A). Given that the AV+FMT group was protective but AV+ANA was not, we hypothesized that bacteria enriched in the AV+FMT versus AV+ANA likely promoted the antiviral response. Of the 34 differentially expressed ASVs that were increased in the AV+FMT group at 1 dpi ( Table S1 ), 28 were in the Clostridiales order, 10 shared sequence identity with annotated Clostridium species, and one was related closely to Clostridium scindens ( Figure 6 B), a human symbiont not present in the natural mouse microbiota, which can modulate immunity through production of short-chain fatty acids and transformation of primary BA ( Buffie et al., 2015 6.

Butyrate-producing Clostridium cluster XIVa species specifically colonize mucins in an in vitro gut model ISME J. 2013; 7 :949-961 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, colonization of AV-treated mice with C. scindens ( Figure S7 A) reduced CHIKV infection in serum and peripheral blood leukocytes ( Figures 6 C and 6D). In comparison, colonization with Enterococcus faecalis ( Figure S7 B), an unrelated gram-positive gastrointestinal (GI) tract organism that also is targeted by AV treatment, did not inhibit CHIKV infection ( Figures 6 C and 6D).
We hypothesized that C. scindens restricted CHIKV infection by promoting pDC-dependent MyD88-driven type I IFN responses. Indeed, C. scindens colonization in AV-treated mice restored type I IFN levels in serum following CHIKV infection to those detected in vehicle-treated controls at 1 dpi ( Figure 6 E). In comparison, C. scindens colonization of AV-treated Stat1 −/− mice did not reduce viremia ( Figure 6 F). The protective effect of C. scindens colonization required MyD88 signaling, because increased CHIKV infection of monocytes was observed in Myd88 −/− mice even after C. scindens colonization ( Figure 6 G). Depletion of pDCs in AV-treated, C. scindens -colonized mice resulted in an increase in CHIKV viremia at 1 dpi compared to isotype control mAb-treated C. scindens -colonized mice ( Figure 6 H), and IFN-α production ex vivo was restored in pDCs following C. scindens colonization ( Figure 6 I).
Because CHIKV is maintained in a transmission cycle in which viremia is a determinant of vector infection, we assessed whether manipulation of the microbiome could impact transmission to the mosquito vector. Blood was harvested at 1 dpi from mice treated with vehicle or AV, or AV and colonized with C. scindens , and presented for feeding to Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. After oral engorgement by mosquitoes, CHIKV titers in the salivary gland-containing head were quantified 7 days later by quantitative real-time PCR. Mean and median viral titers were higher in mosquitoes fed on blood from CHIKV-infected AV-treated mice than vehicle-treated or AV-treated mice colonized with C. scindens ( Figure 6 J). A larger fraction of mosquitoes was positive for CHIKV RNA in the group exposed to blood from AV-treated (17 of 32) than vehicle-treated (11 of 39) or C. scindens -colonized (7 of 34) mice ( Figure 6 K). Thus, in the setting of an altered microbiome, colonization of mice with C. scindens can limit CHIKV viremia in a mammalian host and prevent transmission back to the mosquito vector.
C. scindens harbors the BA-inducible operon genes that regulate 7-α-dehydroxylation, an enzymatic step that converts primary BA to the secondary BA, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) ( Ridlon et al., 2006 68. Ridlon, J.M. ∙ Kang, D.J. ∙ Hylemon, P.B. Bile salt biotransformations by human intestinal bacteria J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47 :241-259 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2051) PubMed Google Scholar ; Studer et al., 2016 81. Studer, N. ∙ Desharnais, L. ∙ Beutler, M. ...

Microbiol. 2016; 6 :191 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Secondary BA, which exclusively are generated by gut bacteria, reportedly have immunomodulatory activity ( Fiorucci et al., 2018 22. Fiorucci, S. ∙ Biagioli, M. ∙ Zampella, A. ... Bile Acids Activated Receptors Regulate Innate Immunity Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1853 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although C. scindens generates both DCA and LCA in the colon, LCA is present at much lower concentrations, and the majority of it is excreted in feces ( Nie et al., 2015 60. Nie, Y.F. ∙ Hu, J. ∙ Yan, X.H. Cross-talk between bile acids and intestinal microbiota in host metabolism and health J. Zhejiang Univ. Sci. B. 2015; 16 :436-446 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, DCA is absorbed in the colon, can be detected in the serum of mice, and its levels are reduced with oral Abx treatment ( Sayin et al., 2013 71. Sayin, S.I. ∙ Wahlström, A. ∙ Felin, J. ...

We hypothesized that production of DCA by C. scindens might restrict systemic CHIKV infection in AV-treated mice.
Markedly lower levels of DCA were detected in feces of mice treated with Abx (AV) or colonized with anaerobic cultures (AV+ANA) in comparison to vehicle-treated mice or AV-treated mice colonized with FMTs or C. scindens ( Figure 7 A). Although amplification of the human symbiont C. scindens was not detected in vehicle-treated mice ( Figure S7 A), DCA levels were comparable between vehicle- and AV-treated mice colonized with C. scindens , suggesting that other uncharacterized bacteria in the mouse microbiota generate secondary BA. DCA levels also were lower in feces of AV-treated mice colonized with Clostridium clostridioforme , a related species that does not generate secondary BA ( Dehoux et al., 2016 17.

Microbiol. 2016; 6 :191 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite efficient colonization of AV-treated mice with C. clostridioforme prior to CHIKV infection ( Figure S7 C), viral burden in the serum or peripheral blood leukocytes was equivalent to that of AV-treated mice ( Figures 6 C and 6D), and serum type I IFN levels of C. clostridioforme -colonized mice were lower than in C. scindens -colonized mice ( Figure 6 E).
Oral administration of DCA to AV-treated mice ( Figures 7 B–7D) or GF mice ( Figures 7 E–7H) prior to CHIKV infection resulted in reduced viral titers in serum and peripheral blood leukocytes and restored type I IFN responses at 1 dpi. The ability of C. scindens colonization and DCA treatment to decrease viremia of AV-treated mice depended on MyD88 expression, because the effect was lost in Myd88 −/− mice ( Figure 7 I). Moreover, DCA administration to AV-treated mice reestablished IFN responses in pDCs at 1 dpi ( Figure 7 J). Last, DCA treatment of non-Abx-treated mice decreased viral burden in the serum, peripheral blood leukocytes, and spleen compared to non-DCA treated controls ( Figures 7 K–7M). These results demonstrate a functional role for microbiome-derived secondary BA in promoting MyD88-dependent type I IFN responses that limit CHIKV infection in circulation even in the context of an unperturbed microbiome.

Section: Discussion

We have established a previously unknown role for the intestinal microbiome in promoting antiviral responses to alphavirus infection. Our study demonstrates that: (1) loss of the microbiome leads to increases in alphavirus burden in the blood and spleen as early as 24 h post-inoculation due to enhanced infection of circulating monocytes; (2) microbiome depletion results in blunted systemic production of type I IFN, which we link to altered MyD88 signaling in pDCs, and renders circulating monocytes more susceptible to infection; and (3) colonization of mice with a single bacterial species, C. scindens and its derived secondary BA, can restore MyD88-dependent type I IFN responses in pDCs and reduce CHIKV viremia, dissemination, and limit transmission to a primary mosquito vector.
A growing literature suggests the intestinal microbiome can shape antiviral immune responses at distant sites. Abx-treated or GF mice have defects in innate and adaptive immune responses following infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, influenza virus, murine cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, or flaviviruses ( Abt et al., 2012 1.

Microbiota-Driven Tonic Interferon Signals in Lung Stromal Cells Protect from Influenza Virus Infection Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :245-256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that depletion of the intestinal microbiome results in diminished type I IFN responses and increased alphavirus infection within circulating monocytes.
Although a role for the microbiome in promoting ISG responses is established, the signaling pathways and cellular sources of type I IFN are less well defined. Our study identifies a mechanism by which the microbiome instructs viral infection-dependent type I IFN responses through a pathway that requires TLR7 and MyD88 signaling in pDCs ( Figure 7 N). Our model is generally consistent with a study demonstrating that the microbiome regulates pathogen recognition receptor-dependent type I IFN production by pDCs at systemic sites under steady-state conditions ( Schaupp et al., 2020 72. Schaupp, L. ∙ Muth, S. ∙ Rogell, L. ... Microbiota-Induced Type I Interferons Instruct a Poised Basal State of Dendritic Cells Cell. 2020; 181 :1080-1096 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in our analysis, differences in IFN gene expression in pDCs were not observed between Abx- and vehicle-treated controls at steady state (0 dpi), possibly because we profiled Abx-treated rather than GF mice or because we did not use highly sensitive IFN reporter mice.
Profiling of pDCs sorted from AV-treated mice at 1 day post-alphavirus infection revealed downregulation of genes involved in type I IFN induction or responses. CD11c + cells isolated from GF mice had blunted type I IFN responses to either poly(I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in cell culture ( Ganal et al., 2012 25. Ganal, S.C. ∙ Sanos, S.L. ∙ Kallfass, C. ... Priming of natural killer cells by nonmucosal mononuclear phagocytes requires instructive signals from commensal microbiota Immunity. 2012; 37 :171-186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our analysis of pDCs, Ifnb expression differences were not observed between Abx- and vehicle-treated controls at 1 dpi. These data are consistent with experiments in IFN-α6 and IFN-β reporter mice, which showed that cDCs produce type I IFNs in response to poly (I:C) via TLR3/TRIF or MDA5 signaling whereas pDCs produce type I IFNs in response to TLR7/TLR9 agonists via MyD88 signaling ( Kato et al., 2005 42.

USA. 2008; 105 :20416-20421 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). The microbiome-mediated effect on alphavirus-dependent type I IFN responses occurs independently of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, all sensors of bacteria or bacterial products. Although, TLR7 triggers type I IFN induction through the recognition of viral RNA, it is conceivable that bacterial RNA also is recognized in the endosome of pDCs, as was demonstrated in conventional DCs following ex vivo exposure to group B streptococcus ( Mancuso et al., 2009 52.

A single bacterial species, C. scindens , and its secondary BA metabolite, DCA, restored control of CHIKV infection in circulation in a MyD88-, type I IFN-, and pDC-dependent manner. C. scindens encodes genes mediating 7-α dehydroxylation, the enzymatic step that converts unconjugated primary BA to secondary BA ( Pavlidis et al., 2015 66.

Although many bacteria encode for enzymes that deconjugate primary BA, bacteria encoding 7-α dehydroxylases comprise only 0.0001% of total colonic microbes ( Ridlon et al., 2006 68.

The generation of secondary BA by the intestinal microbiome, including C. scindens, likely contributes to its ability to limit CHIKV dissemination.

Moreover, exogenous administration of DCA to Abx-treated or GF mice restored type I IFN responses and limited CHIKV infection in blood, and even DCA prophylaxis of mice with a normal microbiome diminished CHIKV infection. Studies with C. scindens mutants lacking the ability to transform BAs could confirm the role of secondary BAs in C. scindens -dependent regulation of immune responses against alphavirus infection.

Only two studies have described an effect of BA signaling in the context of systemic type I IFN responses or viral infections outside of the GI tract. Mice lacking the BA receptor TGR5 sustained enhanced lethality following infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, or HSV-1 infection, and this corresponded with decreased type I IFN levels in serum ( Hu et al., 2019 35. Hu, M.-M. ∙ He, W.-R. ∙ Gao, P. ...

Immunol. 2018; 9 :2289 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these studies demonstrated a role for BA receptor signaling in antiviral IFN responses, the impact of specific bacteria on BA synthesis was not determined. Additional studies are needed to evaluate which cell surface or nuclear BA receptors mediate the protective antiviral effects of DCA and C. scindens . Finally, the link between BA signaling and pDC activation remains uncertain, although it is possible that accumulation of BA promotes IRF3-dependent antiviral responses through Src kinase, as demonstrated in cell lines ( Hu et al., 2019 35. Hu, M.-M. ∙ He, W.-R. ∙ Gao, P. ... Virus-induced accumulation of intracellular bile acids activates the TGR5-β-arrestin-SRC axis to enable innate antiviral immunity Cell Res. 2019; 29 :193-205 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas circulating pDCs might sense secondary BA to facilitate type I IFN signaling, other cell types also may be required to mediate this response. Experiments with cell-type-specific conditional deletion of BA receptors likely are needed to address this question.
In summary, our detailed mechanistic analysis demonstrates how particular immune cells and signaling pathways are modulated by the microbiome to limit alphavirus infection in circulating immune cells and subsequent dissemination. The finding that a specific bacterium and its associated metabolites can restrict alphavirus dissemination may provide insight into the variability of clinical disease in humans and enable approaches for mitigating alphavirus infection outcome and possibly, its transmission to mosquito vectors and epidemic spread.

The following viruses were used in the study: CHIKV La Reunion OPY1 (CHIKV-LR 2006), CHIKV SL15469-GFP, and MAYV BeH407. The CHIKV La Reunion OPY1 strain was produced from an cDNA clone as described previously ( Tsetsarkin et al., 2006 88. Tsetsarkin, K. ∙ Higgs, S. ∙ McGee, C.E. ... Infectious clones of Chikungunya virus (La Réunion isolate) for vector competence studies Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2006; 6 :325-337 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). The recombinant CHIKV SL15469 strain expressing GFP in frame with the CHIKV structural polyprotein was generated using a previously described strategy ( McCarthy et al., 2018 53.

Chikungunya virus impairs draining lymph node function by inhibiting HEV-mediated lymphocyte recruitment JCI Insight. 2018; 3 :e121100 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). A tandem sequence encoding the GFP sequence was linked to 19 amino acids of the 2A protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus and inserted in-frame between capsid and E3 of CHIKV. Stocks of infectious CHIKV strains were generated from cDNA clones and titered by FFA on Vero cells. MAYV BeH407 was obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (R. Tesh, K. Plante, and S. Weaver, University of Texas Medical Branch) and passaged in Vero cells ( Earnest et al., 2019 19. Earnest, J.T. ∙ Basore, K. ∙ Roy, V. ... Neutralizing antibodies against Mayaro virus require Fc effector functions for protective activity J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :2282-2301 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Virus titers were determined by FFA in Vero cells.
Experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health after approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (Assurance number A3381-01). Dissections and footpad injections were performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
Conventionally-housed three-week-old C57BL/6J wild-type mice were purchased commercially (000664, Jackson Laboratories). Knock-out and transgenic mice on the C57BL/6J background were bred at the Washington University Animal Facility and maintained in the same facility under specific-pathogen-free conditions and included the following strains: Ifnar1 tm1Agt ( Ifnar1 −/− ) ( Kamphuis et al., 2006 41.

Mice were fed a 20% protein diet (PicoLab 5053, Purina) and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (6 am to 6 pm). Male and female mice were housed in groups of up to 5 mice per cage. Age- and sex-matched male mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the footpad with 10 3 FFU of CHIKV or MAYV at 4-5 weeks of age. C57BL/6N GF mice were bred and housed at the Washington University Gnotobiotic Core Facility. GF status was confirmed through 16S qPCR analysis provided by Charles Rivers.
BHK21 and Vero cells were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 25 mM HEPES. L929 and BHK21 cells were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 25 mM HEPES.
Colonized Aedes albopictus , originating from Trenton, NJ, were presented with mouse blood in a Hemotek feeding apparatus as previously described ( Park et al., 2018 65.

Bodies and heads were then separated for titration on Vero cells or analysis by RT-qPCR to determine infection and dissemination rates respectively ( Pal et al., 2014 64. Pal, P. ∙ Fox, J.M. ∙ Hawman, D.W. ... Chikungunya viruses that escape monoclonal antibody therapy are clinically attenuated, stable, and not purified in mosquitoes J.

Cages of mice were treated ad lib at 3 to 4 weeks of age with an oral Abx cocktail (1 g/L ampicillin (A) and 0.5 g/L vancomycin (V); from Sigma) in 20 g/L grape Kool-Aid (Kraft Foods) or with Kool-Aid (vehicle) alone. Cages, food, and water were autoclaved and mice were handled in sterile hoods. For most experiments, mice received oral Abx for 3 days as indicated in Figure 1 A. For experiments involving colonization with C. scindens, C. clostridiforme, and E. faecalis , mice received oral Abx for 5 days.
Fecal contents from mice were collected, diluted in PBS + 10% glycerol, homogenized, and clarified by passing the contents through a 100-uM filter. Aliquots were frozen on dry-ice and stored at −80°C. Mice were gavaged with 10 8 colony-forming units (CFU) in 100 uL of sterile PBS.
Sodium deoxycholate (DCA: 0.2%; Sigma 30970) was added to the drinking water for 1 week prior to infection with CHIKV.
Fecal samples were harvested into 2 mL tubes (Sarstedt) with 1 mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (Biospec). Fecal pellets were frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80°C. Nucleic acid was extracted from fecal pellets as described previously ( Baldridge et al., 2015 2. Baldridge, M.T. ∙ Nice, T.J. ∙ McCune, B.T. ... Commensal microbes and interferon-λ determine persistence of enteric murine norovirus infection Science. 2015; 347 :266-269 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ). SYBR green quantitative PCR for bacterial 16S rRNA genes was performed using primers 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 805R (5′-GACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3′), and the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Quantitation of 16S rRNA genes was performed by comparison to a plasmid standard of pCR2.1 TOPO (ThermoFisher Scientific) containing a mouse reference 16S rRNA sequence as described previously ( Thackray et al., 2018 87. Thackray, L.B. ∙ Handley, S.A. ∙ Gorman, M.J. ... Oral Antibiotic Treatment of Mice Exacerbates the Disease Severity of Multiple Flavivirus Infections Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :3440-3453 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For experiments in which mice were colonized with specific bacterial strains, feces was collected from the treated groups of mice at 1 day post-CHIKV infection, and DNA was isolated as described previously ( Baldridge et al., 2015 2. Baldridge, M.T. ∙ Nice, T.J. ∙ McCune, B.T. ... Commensal microbes and interferon-λ determine persistence of enteric murine norovirus infection Science. 2015; 347 :266-269 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ). SYBR green quantitative PCR for bacterial 16S rRNA genes was performed using primers listed below and the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. The following primers were used for PCR- based amplification ( Steed et al., 2017 80. Steed, A.L. ∙ Christophi, G.P. ∙ Kaiko, G.E. ...

Bar-coded PCR primers targeting the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were used to generate amplicons from nucleic acid isolated from fecal pellets ( Baldridge et al., 2015 2. Baldridge, M.T. ∙ Nice, T.J. ∙ McCune, B.T. ... Commensal microbes and interferon-λ determine persistence of enteric murine norovirus infection Science. 2015; 347 :266-269 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiplex sequencing of amplicons with sample-specific barcodes was performed using an Illumina MiSeq instrument (paired end 2x250 nucleotide reads).
Read quality control and the resolution of sequence variants (ASVs) was completed using the dada2 R package ( Callahan et al., 2016 8. Callahan, B.J. ∙ McMurdie, P.J. ∙ Rosen, M.J. ... DADA2: High-resolution sample inference from Illumina amplicon data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :581-583 Crossref Scopus (17029) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads were quality-controlled by the removal of the 5′ 10 bases of the forward read and 3′ 10 bases of the reverse read. All sequences with Ns and reads mapping to phiX were removed. Taxonomy was assigned independently to the RDP training set 14 reference sequence database with additional species level assignment using the addSpecies function of dada2. ASVs were aligned using an R implementation of MSA ( Bodenhofer et al., 2015 3. Bodenhofer, U. ∙ Bonatesta, E. ∙ Horejš-Kainrath, C. ... msa: an R package for multiple sequence alignment Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3997-3999 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ) and arranged into a maximum likelihood phylogeny (GTR model with optimization of the proportion of invariable sites and the gamma rate parameter) using the phangorn package to generate the phylogenetic tree required for UniFrac analysis ( Schliep, 2011 76. Schliep, K.P. phangorn: phylogenetic analysis in R Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :592-593 Crossref Scopus (2281) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting phylogenetic tree was combined with the table of ASVs and merged with sample data for loading into the PhyloSeq package ( McMurdie and Holmes, 2013 54. McMurdie, P.J. ∙ Holmes, S. phyloseq: an R package for reproducible interactive analysis and graphics of microbiome census data PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e61217 Crossref Scopus (11490) PubMed Google Scholar ). ASVs not assigned to the kingdom bacteria or assigned to the mitochondrial family or chloroplast class were removed.
PhyloSeq was used to calculate alpha diversity measures of Shannon Diversity and observed richness and beta diversity using weighted UniFrac ( Lozupone et al., 2007 49. Lozupone, C.A. ∙ Hamady, M. ∙ Kelley, S.T. ... Quantitative and qualitative β diversity measures lead to different insights into factors that structure microbial communities Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73 :1576-1585 Crossref Scopus (1853) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential abundance testing of taxa between groups was completed using the DeSeq2 algorithm ( Love et al., 2014 48. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ).

CHIKV- or MAYV-infected mice were euthanized at 1, 2, 3, or 28 dpi and perfused extensively with 20 mL of PBS. Spleen, ipsilateral, and contralateral ankle tissues were harvested, weighed, and homogenized with zirconia beads in a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 500 μL of DMEM media supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS. For viral burden analysis in serum, blood was collected and clotted at room temperature and serum was separated. For viral burden analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes, blood was collected and erythrocytes were lysed with ammonium chloride potassium (ACK) lysis buffer (GIBCO). Remaining cells were resuspended in RNA lysis buffer. For viral burden analysis of mosquitos, bodies or heads were homogenized at 26 Hz for 4 minutes in L15 media. All tissue homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and stored at −80°C. RNA was extracted using an Applied Biosystems 5x MagMax RNA 96 viral isolation kit (Thermo Scientific) and a Kingfisher duo prime extraction machine (Thermo Scientific). For some samples, viral burden was determined by FFA on Vero cells as described ( Fox et al., 2015 23. Fox, J.M. ∙ Long, F. ∙ Edeling, M.A. ... Broadly Neutralizing Alphavirus Antibodies Bind an Epitope on E2 and Inhibit Entry and Egress Cell. 2015; 163 :1095-1107 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). CHIKV RNA levels were determined by one-step quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT–PCR) using an Applied Biosystems Taqman RNA-to-Ct 1-step kit (Thermo Scientific) on an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument using standard cycling conditions and previously designed primer/probe sets for CHIKV and MAYV ( Fox et al., 2015 23. Fox, J.M. ∙ Long, F. ∙ Edeling, M.A. ... Broadly Neutralizing Alphavirus Antibodies Bind an Epitope on E2 and Inhibit Entry and Egress Cell. 2015; 163 :1095-1107 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Viral burden was expressed on a log 10 scale as CHIKV RNA equivalents per gram or ml after comparison with a standard curve produced using RNA isolated from viral stocks as a standard curve to determine FFU equivalents, as previously described ( Fox et al., 2019 24. Fox, J.M. ∙ Roy, V. ∙ Gunn, B.M. ... Optimal therapeutic activity of monoclonal antibodies against chikungunya virus requires Fc-Fcλptimal therapeutic activity Sci. Immunol. 2019; 4 eaav5062 Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar ).
Four-week-old vehicle or AV-treated WT mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the foot with 10 3 FFU of CHIKV LR 2006. At 3 dpi, animals were euthanized and perfused extensively with PBS. Spleens were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RNA in situ hybridization was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Assay (Brown Kit) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, sections were deparaffinized, treated with H 2 O 2 and Protease Plus prior to probe hybridization. A probe specifically targeting the CHIKV RNA (strain La Reunion) (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 481891) was custom-designed and used for in situ hybridization experiments. Tissues were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin. An uninfected mouse was used as a negative control and stained in parallel. Tissue sections were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse microscope equipped with an Olympus DP71 color camera.
Peripheral blood and spleens of CHIKV-infected mice were harvested after perfusion with PBS. Splenocytes were obtained by generating a single cell suspension and passaging it through a 70-μm filter. Erythrocytes were lysed with ammonium chloride potassium (ACK) lysis buffer (GIBCO), and remaining cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 mM EDTA and maintained on ice. To analyze levels of viral antigen on the surface of different cell subsets, after blockade of Fcγ receptors with anti-CD16/32 (eBioscience; clone 93) and staining for viability (eBioscience; FVD eFluor 506), staining for cell surface antigens CD45 BUV395, CD3 BUV737, CD19 PE, CD115 APC-Cy7, Ly6G BV650, Ly6C Pacific Blue, CD11b PE/Dazzle 594, CD11c PE-Cy7, MHC II AF700, NK1.1 BV785, and CD43 FITC was performed. To reduce possible background binding to Fcγ receptors on myeloid cells, aglycosyl (N297Q) variants of each mAb were used ( Tao and Morrison, 1989 85. Tao, M.H. ∙ Morrison, S.L. Studies of aglycosylated chimeric mouse-human IgG. Role of carbohydrate in the structure and effector functions mediated by the human IgG constant region J. Immunol. 1989; 143 :2595-2601 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Viral antigen (E1 and E2 proteins) on the surface of cells was detected using aglycosyl (N297Q), biotinylated humanized anti-CHIKV (CHK-152 and CHK-166) ( Pal et al., 2013 63.

Earnest, J.T. ∙ Basore, K. ∙ Roy, V. ... Neutralizing antibodies against Mayaro virus require Fc effector functions for protective activity J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :2282-2301 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ) Abs, with West Nile virus (WNV) E16 serving as an isotype control mAb ( Oliphant et al., 2005 62. Oliphant, T. ∙ Engle, M. ∙ Nybakken, G.E. ... Development of a humanized monoclonal antibody with therapeutic potential against West Nile virus Nat. Med. 2005; 11 :522-530 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). Secondary staining was followed with streptavidin-conjugated APC (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed using 1% PFA and processed for flow cytometry with the BD LSRFortessa X20 flow cytometer.
For cell sorting experiments, splenic pDCs were isolated and after blockade of Fcγ receptors with anti-CD16/32 (eBioscience; clone 93), cells were stained for viability (eBioscience; FVD eFluor 506) and with B220 BV711, PDCA-1 FITC, Siglec H APC, and LyC6 Pacific Blue. Ly6C hi monocytes of the peripheral blood were isolated following two rounds of ACK lysis and stained with CD115 APC Cy7, CD11b PE-Texas Red, and LY6C Pacific Blue. Cells were sorted using a BD FACS Aria II.
For monocyte and neutrophil depletion, anti-Ly6G/Ly6C (Gr-1; BioXCell; clone RB6-8C5; 500 μg) or an isotype control (BioXCell; clone LTF-2; 500 μg) was administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection one day before CHIKV infection. For neutrophil depletion, anti-Ly6G (BioXCell; clone 1A8; 250 μg) or an isotype control (BioXCell; clone 2A3; 250 μg) was administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection one day before infection. For monocyte depletion, anti-CCR2 (clone MC-21; 25 μg) ( Mack et al., 2001 51. Mack, M. ∙ Cihak, J. ∙ Simonis, C. ... Expression and characterization of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 in mice J. Immunol. 2001; 166 :4697-4704 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ) or an isotype control mAb (BioXCell; clone LTF-2; 25 μg) was administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection one day before infection. For pDC depletion, anti-PDCA-1 (clone 927; 100 μg) or an isotype control mAb (BioXCell; clone LTF-2; 100 μg) was administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection one day before infection ( Isaksson et al., 2009 38. Isaksson, M. ∙ Ardesjö, B. ∙ Rönnblom, L. ... Plasmacytoid DC promote priming of autoimmune Th17 cells and EAE Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39 :2925-2935 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For analysis of immune cell depletion, peripheral blood was collected on the day of harvest. Erythrocytes were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (GIBCO) and resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. For Ly6G/Ly6C, Ly6G, or CCR2 depletion, single-cell suspensions were blocked for FcγR binding and stained with antibodies against CD45 BUV395, CD11b PE/Dazzle 594, Ly6C Pacific Blue, Ly6B FITC, Ly6G BV650, and fixable viability dye (eFluor 506). For pDC depletions, single cell suspensions were blocked for FcγR binding and stained with antibodies against CD45 BUV395, CD19 BV711, CD3 BV711, NK1.1 BV711, B220 BV711, Siglec H APC, Ly6C Pacific Blue, and PDCA-1 FITC.
Frozen FMT stocks were thawed and cultivated for 48 h in liquid Brain Heart Infusion Media under strict anaerobic conditions (Coy Laboratory Products Anaerobic Vinyl Chamber). CFU count was determined by OD 600, and approximately 10 9 CFU of bacteria was administered per mouse. C. scindens , E. faecalis , and C. clostridioforme were obtained originally from the American Type Culture Collection. C. scindens and C. clostridioforme were grown in chopped meat media broth for 48 h under anaerobic conditions. E. faecalis was grown in chopped meat media broth for 48 h under aerobic conditions. C. scindens and E. faecalis were administered orally at 10 8 CFU of bacteria per mouse one day after cessation of Abx treatment. C. clostridioforme was administered orally at 10 9 CFU of bacteria per mouse one and two days post-cessation of Abx treatment.
Splenocytes were isolated from uninfected CCR2-GFP mice and CD11b + Ly6C + GFP + cells were sorted on a BD FACS Aria II. Cells (2 × 10 6 ) were transferred intravenously into either AV- or vehicle-treated WT recipient mice. Eighteen hours later recipient mice were infected subcutaneously with CHIKV. At 1 day post-CHIKV infection, viral antigen staining using CHK-152 and CHK-166 was determined in the spleen by flow cytometry as described above following enrichment for CD11b + cells using anti-CD11b + microbeads (Milliteyni). Transferred cells were identified as GFP + CD11b + .
AV- and vehicle-treated WT and Ifnar1 −/− mice were treated with an anti-IFN-γ blocking monoclonal antibody (200 ug, mAb H22; Leinco, I-438) or an IgG isotype control antibody (200 ug mAb PIP; Leinco, I-140) 1 day prior to infection with CHIKV as previously published ( Harty et al., 1992 28.

IFN- γ levels in serum were measured by an ELISA as per manufacturer’s instructions (R &D Systems).
Chimeric mice were generated by using modifications to a published protocol ( Nair et al., 2017 59. Nair, S. ∙ Poddar, S. ∙ Shimak, R.M. ... Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 Protects against Chikungunya Virus-Induced Immunopathology by Restricting Infection in Muscle Cells J. Virol. 2017; 91 e01419-17 Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar ). Briefly, 3-week-old WT CD45.1 congenic mice were irradiated with 900 Rads and reconstituted via intravenous injection with 10 7 bone marrow cells isolated from the tibias and femurs of 6-week-old BDCA-DTR (CD45.1/2) +WT (CD45.2) or BDCA-DTR (CD45.1/2) + Myd88 −/− (CD45.2) mixed 1:1. Five weeks after bone marrow transplantation, mice were bled to confirm chimerism by flow cytometry and started on either AV or vehicle treatment. Mice were inoculated with 10 3 FFU of CHIKV subcutaneously six weeks after bone marrow transplantation. DT was administered intraperitoneally (100 ng/ mouse) 1 day prior to CHIKV infection.
Levels of biologically active type I IFN in serum were determined using an encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) L929 cell cytopathic effect bioassay as described previously ( Sheehan et al., 2006 78. Sheehan, K.C. ∙ Lai, K.S. ∙ Dunn, G.P. ... Blocking monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse IFN-alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR-1) from mice immunized by in vivo hydrodynamic transfection J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2006; 26 :804-819 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 79. Sheehan, K.C. ∙ Lazear, H.M. ∙ Diamond, M.S. ... Selective Blockade of Interferon-α and -β Reveals Their Non-Redundant Functions in a Mouse Model of West Nile Virus Infection PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0128636 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, serum was diluted serially in DMEM containing 10% FBS and applied in duplicate to L929 cells (2 × 10 4 cells/well) in 96-well plates. Following incubation for 14 h at 37°C, cells were inoculated with EMCV diluted in DMEM containing 2% FBS at a MOI of 7. At 8 h post-infection, IFN-mediated protection was assayed using CellTiter 96 aqueous cell proliferation assay as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). IFN levels were calculated from an IFN-β standard curve. To ensure protection from EMCV-induced death was due to type I IFN activity, L929 cells also were pre-treated with an anti-Ifnar1 mAb (MAR-1-5A3, 50 ug/mL) prior to the addition of serum samples.
Splenic and bone-marrow-derived pDCs were isolated and after blockade of Fcγ receptors with anti-CD16/32 (eBioscience; clone 93), cells were stained for viability (eBioscience; FVD eFluor 506) and with B220 BV711, PDCA-1 FITC, Siglec H APC, and LyC6 Pacific. Primary cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glutamax, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1 uM β-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO-Invitrogen). Sorted pDCs were stimulated overnight with CpGA 2216 (6 μg/ml, Operon) ; CpGB 1826 (6 μg/ml, Operon) or Imiquimod (6 μM, InvivoGen). IL-6 and IFN-α levels were measured by ELISA in the cell supernatant at 18 h post-stimulation.
RNA was isolated from sorted peripheral blood monocytes using the MagMAX mirVana Total RNA Isolation Kit as per manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression levels of Bst2, Isg15, Ifnb, Ifna4, Rsad2, Ifit3, and Ifitm3 were determined via qRT-PCR and normalized to GAPDH expression.
RNA was isolated from splenic pDCs using the MagMAX mirVana Total RNA Isolation Kit as per manufacturer’s instructions and for RNA analysis, 100 ng total RNA was hybridized to a nCounter® Mouse Immunology Panel (XT-CSO-MIM1-12) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (NanoString Technologies Inc.). The gene expression data were normalized to a set of 6 internal positive and 8 internal negative controls and then 14 internal reference genes. Values above the threshold (mean + 2SD of the negative controls) were considered for analysis. Normalized log2-transformed values were analyzed and unbiased hierarchical clustering was used to generate heatmaps in nSolver analysis software 4.0. Data is available at GEO: GSE152043 .
Leukocytes of the peripheral blood were isolated following two rounds of ACK lysis. T and B cells were depleted using CD4, CD8, and CD19 microbeads (Millitenyi) to enrich for myeloid cells. Cells were resuspended at 100 cells/μL in PBS containing 0.04% (w/v) BSA to minimize cell loss and aggregation. ~17,500 cells were partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs) to achieve single cell resolution for a maximum of 10,000 individual cells per sample. Utilizing the v2 Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library Kit and Chromium instrument (10x Genomics), poly-adenylated mRNA from an individual cell was tagged with a unique 16 basepair 10x barcode and 10 basepair Unique Molecular Identifier. Full length cDNA was amplified to generate sufficient mass for library construction. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection were used to optimize the cDNA amplicon size (~400 basepair) for the library. The final library was sequence-ready and contained four unique sample indexes. The concentration of the 10x single cell library was determined through qPCR (Kapa Biosystems). The libraries were normalized, pooled, and sequenced with a custom recipe (26-8-98) on the HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina). Five single cell libraries were sequenced across an entire HiSeq4000 flow cell targeting ~45,000 reads per cell.
The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (version 3.0.2) ( https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger ) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3′ counting. Cellranger mkfastq was used to demultiplex raw base call files from the HiSeq4000 sequencer into sample-specific fastq files. Files was demultiplexed with 98%+ perfect barcode match, and 74%+ q30 reads. Subsequently, fastq files for each sample were processed with cellranger counts to align reads to the mm10 mouse genome. The default estimated cell count value of 7,000 was used for this experiment. Samples were subsampled to have equal numbers of confidently mapped reads per cell. After filtration and cluster removal total cells count was 4,695.
For the analysis, the Seurat package (version 3.0.1) ( Butler et al., 2018 7. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6218) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used. Cell Ranger filtered genes by barcode expression matrices were used as analysis inputs. Samples were pooled together using the merge function. The fraction of mitochondrial genes was calculated for every cell, and cells with a mitochondrial fraction > 5% or less than 150 gene reads were filtered out. Two sources of unwanted variation (UMI counts and the fraction of mitochondrial reads) were removed with RegressOut function. Expression measurements for each cell were normalized by total expression and then scaled to 10,000, after that log normalization was performed.
The most variable genes were detected using FindVariableGenes function. PCA was done only using these genes. Cells are represented with t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) plots. We applied RunTSNE function to normalized data, using first 20 PCA components. For clustering, we used function FindClusters tat implements SNN (shared nearest neighbor) modularity optimization based clustering algorithm on 20 PCA components with a resolution of 0.3 Seven clusters were detected, one of which contained poorly covered cells (lower number of UMIs and detected genes); this cluster was excluded from further analysis. Four clusters were filtered out based off expression of Adgre1 and Saa3, representing macrophage contamination due to the method of sample collection.
To identify marker genes, FindAllMarkers function was used with likelihood-ratio test for single cell gene expression. For each cluster only genes that were expressed in more than 25% of cells with at least 0.25-fold difference were considered. To characterize clusters, we used the following markers: T cells: Cd3d; NK cells: Ncr1; B cells: Cd79a; neutrophils: S100a8; monocyte/myeloid cells: Csf1r, Ly6c2, Cd209a, Cx3cr1.
To obtain differential expression between cells derived from AV-treated or vehicle-treated groups at 1 dpi a MAST test was performed and P value adjustment was performed using a Bonferroni correction ( Finak et al., 2015 21. Finak, G. ∙ McDavid, A. ∙ Yajima, M. ... MAST: a flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing data Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :278 Crossref Scopus (1478) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Fecal samples collected at indicated time points were frozen and store in −80°C until further analysis. Samples were extracted at a concentration of 200 mg/mL in 80% methanol containing 1 μM of the internal standard, d4-deoxycholate in a tissue lyserII. Samples were clarified by centrifugation then filtered through 8.0 μm PES spin filters to remove particulates. Samples (2 μl) were loaded onto a 0.5 × 150 mm custom packed C18 column using 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% acetonitrile (B). The gradient started at 2% (B) and continued up to three min followed by a ramp to 100% (B) in over 10 min, with a hold at 100% (B) for 3 min then ramp back down to 2% (B) over three min. The column was then re-equilibrated for 11 min. Data were recorded in negative mode with MS only scan type using a Q-Exactive plus mass spectrometer set to a resolution setting of 70,000 and scan range extending from 200 to 500 daltons. The data were integrated using the QuanBroswer application of Xcalibur. The concentrations are calculated based on comparison to the internal standards and plotting against a calibration curve made from external standard concentrations ranging from 0.075 to 100 mmol. All the mass spectrometry procedures including homogenization of fecal samples were randomized by independent investigators blinded to the treatment.
Blood was collected at 1 dpi from CHIKV-infected mice, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 C in heparan-treated tubes. Frozen viremic blood was used as the source of infectious virus for per os infection of Aedes albopictus ( Park et al., 2018 65. Park, S.L. ∙ Huang, Y.S. ∙ Higgs, S. ... Application of a Nonpaper Based Matrix to Preserve Chikungunya Virus Infectivity at Ambient Temperature Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2018; 18 :278-281 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Six-to-ten-day-old female mosquitoes were deprived of sugar for 24 hours and orally exposed to infectious blood meals supplemented with 3 mM of adenosine triphosphate as a phagostimulant ( Huang et al., 2017 36. Huang, Y.S. ∙ Lyons, A.C. ∙ Hsu, W.-W. ... Differential outcomes of Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti orally challenged with infectious blood meals and infectious protein meals PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0182386 PubMed Google Scholar ). Engorged mosquitoes were sorted and maintained under previously described conditions ( Pal et al., 2014 64. Pal, P. ∙ Fox, J.M. ∙ Hawman, D.W. ... Chikungunya viruses that escape monoclonal antibody therapy are clinically attenuated, stable, and not purified in mosquitoes J. Virol. 2014; 88 :8213-8226 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individual mosquitoes were cold anesthetized to separate the head and the rest of carcass. Samples were collected in L-15 media, homogenized at 26 Hz for 4 minutes and pelleted at 10,000 RPM. for 10 minutes. Viral burden was determined using RT-qPCR and median tissue culture infectious dose titration methods.
Statistical significance was assigned with P value s of < 0.05 using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (La Jolla, CA). The specific test for each dataset is indicated in respective figure legends and was selected by the number of comparison groups and variance of the data. For some virological and immune cell analysis, significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test. For other viral burden experiments, if data points were of unequal variance, a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s post-test or Mann-Whitney test was used, depending on the number of comparison groups.
