Title: Vertebrate cells differentially interpret ciliary and extraciliary cAMP


Abstract: Summary

Hedgehog pathway components and select G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) localize to the primary cilium, an organelle specialized for signal transduction. We investigated whether cells distinguish between ciliary and extraciliary GPCR signaling. To test whether ciliary and extraciliary cyclic AMP (cAMP) convey different information, we engineered optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to control the subcellular site of cAMP generation. Generating equal amounts of ciliary and cytoplasmic cAMP in zebrafish and mammalian cells revealed that ciliary cAMP, but not cytoplasmic cAMP, inhibited Hedgehog signaling. Modeling suggested that the distinct geometries of the cilium and cell body differentially activate local effectors. The search for effectors identified a ciliary pool of protein kinase A (PKA). Blocking the function of ciliary PKA, but not extraciliary PKA, activated Hedgehog signal transduction and reversed the effects of ciliary cAMP. Therefore, cells distinguish ciliary and extraciliary cAMP using functionally and spatially distinct pools of PKA, and different subcellular pools of cAMP convey different information.

Section: Introduction

Development and homeostasis require cells to discriminate between signals, many of which are received by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class of vertebrate receptors and the targets of many therapeutic drugs ( Hauser et al., 2017 40. Hauser, A.S. ∙ Attwood, M.M. ∙ Rask-Andersen, M. ... Trends in GPCR drug discovery: new agents, targets and indications Nat. Rev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3 :639-650 Crossref Scopus (1921) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ligand binding rearranges GPCR transmembrane domains to activate heterotrimeric G proteins such as Gαs and Gαi. Activating Gαs stimulates adenylyl cyclases to produce cyclic AMP (cAMP), whereas activating Gαi inhibits cAMP production ( Pierce et al., 2002 82. Pierce, K.L. ∙ Premont, R.T. ∙ Lefkowitz, R.J. Seven-transmembrane receptors Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3 :639-650 Crossref Scopus (1921) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A subset of GPCRs localize not to the plasma membrane, but to the membrane of the primary cilium, an organelle specialized for signal transduction and present on most vertebrate cells ( Anvarian et al., 2019 3.

Signaling in the primary cilium through the lens of the Hedgehog pathway Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Dev. Biol. 2020; 9 :e377 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). The distinct lipid and protein composition of the cilium is maintained through a diffusion barrier at the ciliary base called the transition zone ( Gonçalves and Pelletier, 2017 33. Gonçalves, J. ∙ Pelletier, L. The ciliary transition zone: Finding the pieces and assembling the gate Mol. Cells. 2017; 40 :243-253 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). More than 30 different GPCRs localize to cilia, including SSTR3, GPR161, and MC4R, as well as the GPCR-related protein Smoothened (SMO) ( Mykytyn and Askwith, 2017 72. Mykytyn, K. ∙ Askwith, C.

SMO is the central component of the Hedgehog (HH) signal transduction pathway and, in vertebrates, functions at primary cilia to activate GLI transcriptional effectors ( Bangs and Anderson, 2017 7.

In addition to positive effectors of HH signal transduction, negative pathway regulators localize to cilia, including GPR161 ( Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013 71. Mukhopadhyay, S. ∙ Wen, X. ∙ Ratti, N. ...

Apart from GPR161, both cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) negatively regulate HH signal transduction ( Hammerschmidt et al., 1996 37. Hammerschmidt, M. ∙ Bitgood, M.J. ∙ McMahon, A.P.

HH signaling orchestrates diverse developmental and homeostatic processes, including patterning of somites ( Fan and Tessier-Lavigne, 1994 29. Fan, C.-M. ∙ Tessier-Lavigne, M. Patterning of mammalian somites by surface ectoderm and notochord: evidence for sclerotome induction by a hedgehog homolog Cell. 1994; 79 :1175-1186 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Somites are segmental mesodermal aggregates that give rise to multiple cell types, including muscle ( Blagden et al., 1997 13. Blagden, C.S. ∙ Currie, P.D. ∙ Ingham, P.W. ...

The u-boot mutation identifies a Hedgehog-regulated myogenic switch for fiber-type diversification in the zebrafish embryo Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :1563-1576 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). In zebrafish, the notochord produces Sonic hedgehog (Shh) that at high levels specifies muscle pioneers (MPs) that express the transcription factors Engrailed (En) and Prox1 and at lower levels specifies superficial slow fibers (SSFs) that express the transcription factor Prox1 alone ( Barresi et al., 2000 8.

Despite the many signals communicated through cAMP, cells distinguish these signals in order to impart distinct effects ( Calebiro and Koszegi, 2019 18. Calebiro, D. ∙ Koszegi, Z. The subcellular dynamics of GPCR signaling Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2019; 483 :24-30 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002 107. Zaccolo, M. ∙ Pozzan, T. Discrete microdomains with high concentration of cAMP in stimulated rat neonatal cardiac myocytes Science. 2002; 295 :1711-1715 Crossref Scopus (640) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, epinephrine and prostaglandin E1 induce similar increases in cAMP and PKA activity in cardiomyocytes, but only epinephrine induces troponin I phosphorylation and increases contractility ( Brunton et al., 1979 15.

Pharmacol. 1979; 15 :235-245 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ).
How cells distinguish information produced by signals that induce a shared diffusible second messenger is poorly understood. One suggestion has been that different receptors form stable complexes with dedicated effectors ( Tolkovsky and Levitzki, 1978a 92. Tolkovsky, A.M. ∙ Levitzki, A. Coupling of a single adenylate cyclase to two receptors: adenosine and catecholamine Biochemistry. 1978; 17 :3811-3817 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , 1978b 93. Tolkovsky, A.M. ∙ Levitzki, A. Mode of coupling between the β-adrenergic receptor and adenylate cyclase in turkey erythrocytes Biochemistry. 1978; 17 :3795-3810 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Another hypothesis is that different signals are transduced in distinct subcellular domains ( Buxton and Brunton, 1983 17. Buxton, I.L.O. ∙ Brunton, L.L. Compartments of cyclic AMP and protein kinase in mammalian cardiomyocytes J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258 :10233-10239 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subcellular domains with differential GPCR activity include lipid nanodomains and clathrin-associated hotspots within the plasma membrane ( Agarwal et al., 2014 1.

We hypothesized that physically sequestering signaling pathways to either the cilium or the cell body allows parallel information processing without crosstalk. To test whether cells distinguish ciliary and nonciliary cAMP, we generated optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to specifically manipulate ciliary and nonciliary cAMP levels.

Section: Results

To assess whether cAMP generated inside or outside cilia communicate different information, we developed an optogenetic system based on a bacterial photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (bPAC) ( Figure 1 A) ( Stierl et al., 2011 89. Stierl, M. ∙ Stumpf, P. ∙ Udwari, D. ... Light modulation of cellular cAMP by a small bacterial photoactivated adenylyl cyclase, bPAC, of the soil bacterium Beggiatoa J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :1181-1188 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). bPAC generates cAMP in proportion to the amount of blue light delivered. We generated transgenic zebrafish that express either MYC-tagged cytoplasmic bPAC (Cyto-bPAC) or MYC-tagged ARL13B-bPAC (Cilia-bPAC) to investigate the functions of cytosolic and ciliary cAMP during vertebrate development. Immunofluorescence imaging of Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC in zebrafish embryos revealed that, as expected, Cyto-bPAC localized to the cytoplasm and Cilia-bPAC localized to the cilium ( Figures 1 B and S1 A).
To assess whether Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC embryos generate cAMP specifically on stimulation with blue light, we measured cAMP levels and found that Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC embryos raised in the dark contained levels of cAMP equivalent to those of wild-type embryos ( Figure 1 C). Treatment with the adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin increased cAMP levels, as expected ( Figure 1 C). Similar to forskolin, blue light treatment induced equivalent amounts of cAMP in Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC transgenic embryos ( Figure 1 C). Transgenic embryos treated with light were morphologically indistinguishable from light-stimulated wild-type embryos or transgenic embryos raised in the dark, indicating that neither blue light nor the resultant cAMP grossly alters development ( Figure S1 B).
Because cAMP negatively regulates HH signal transduction ( Barresi et al., 2000 8. Barresi, M.J. ∙ Stickney, H.L. ∙ Devoto, S.H. The zebrafish slow-muscle-omittedgene product is required for Hedgehogsignal transduction and the development of slow muscle identit Development. 2000; 27 :2189-2199 Crossref Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 1999 99. Wang, G. ∙ Wang, B. ∙ Jiang, J. Protein kinase A antagonizes Hedgehog signaling by regulating both the activator and repressor forms of Cubitus interruptus Genes Dev. 1999; 13 :2828-2837 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ), we investigated whether ciliary or cytoplasmic cAMP affect HH signal transduction. To begin to investigate HH signaling, we assessed Gli:mCherry , a previously described reporter that induces mCherry expression upon activation of HH signaling ( Mich et al., 2014 67. Mich, J.K. ∙ Payumo, A.Y. ∙ Rack, P.G. ... In vivo imaging of Hedgehog pathway activation with a nuclear fluorescent reporter PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e103661 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, treating zebrafish embryos with forskolin reduced Gli:mCherry expression in the developing somite ( Figure 1 D). Cilia-bPAC expression in the absence of light had no effect on Gli:mCherry expression ( Figures 2 A and 2B), indicating that the ARL13B ciliary targeting sequence does not affect HH signaling. Notably, treating Cyto-bPAC transgenic zebrafish embryos with light had no effect on Gli:mCherry expression ( Figures 2 A and 2B). In striking contrast, activating Cilia-bPAC attenuated Gli:mCherry expression ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
As another control for the dependence on ciliary localization, we created a version of Cilia-bPAC containing a missense mutation in human ARL13B that prevents ciliary localization, V359A ( Gigante et al., 2020 31. Gigante, E.D. ∙ Taylor, M.R. ∙ Ivanova, A.A. ... ARL13B regulates Sonic hedgehog signaling from outside primary cilia eLife. 2020; 9 :e50434 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ; Higginbotham et al., 2012 41. Higginbotham, H. ∙ Eom, T.Y. ∙ Mariani, L.E. ... Arl13b in primary cilia regulates the migration and placement of interneurons in the developing cerebral cortex Dev. Cell. 2012; 23 :925-938 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). We injected mRNA encoding either MYC-tagged ARL13B V359A -bPAC (Nonciliary-bPAC) or Cilia-bPAC. As expected, Nonciliary-bPAC did not localize to cilia in zebrafish embryos and generates cAMP on blue light stimulation ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Similar to Cyto-bPAC, stimulating Nonciliary-bPAC-expressing embryos with blue light had no effect on Gli:mCherry expression ( Figures S2 C and S2D). In contrast, blue light stimulation of embryos injected with mRNA encoding Cilia-bPAC decreased Gli:mCherry expression ( Figures S2 C and S2D). Therefore, in developing somites, cAMP generated in cilia, but not outside cilia, preferentially affects HH signaling.
In the developing zebrafish somite, HH signaling specifies slow muscle fiber types ( Barresi et al., 2001 9. Barresi, M.J.F. ∙ D’Angelo, J.A. ∙ Hernández, L.P. ... Distinct mechanisms regulate slow-muscle development Curr. Biol. 2001; 11 :1432-1438 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ; Blagden et al., 1997 13. Blagden, C.S. ∙ Currie, P.D. ∙ Ingham, P.W. ... Notochord induction of zebrafish slow muscle mediated by Sonic hedgehog Genes Dev. 1997; 11 :2163-2175 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Wolff et al., 2003 102. Wolff, C. ∙ Roy, S. ∙ Ingham, P.W. Multiple muscle cell identities induced by distinct levels and timing of hedgehog activity in the zebrafish embryo Curr. Biol. 2003; 13 :1169-1181 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). High levels of HH signaling specify high En- and Prox1-expressing MPs whereas lower levels specify Prox1-expressing SSFs. Attenuation of HH signaling therefore preferentially depletes MPs ( Figure 2 C). To test whether cytoplasmic or ciliary cAMP affect HH-dependent patterning, we quantified En- and Prox1-expressing somitic cells. Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC embryos raised in the dark produce numbers of En- and Prox1-expressing cells equivalent to those of wild-type embryos, confirming that the ARL13B ciliary targeting sequence does not affect HH signaling ( Figures 2 D–2F). Stimulating wild-type or Cyto-bPAC embryos with light did not alter the number of En- or Prox1-expressing somitic cells ( Figures 2 D–2F). In contrast, stimulating Cilia-bPAC embryos with light reduced the numbers of both En- and Prox1-expressing cells ( Figures 2 D–2F). Thus, HH-dependent cell fates in the developing somite are preferentially inhibited by ciliary, but not cytoplasmic, cAMP production.
To test whether ciliary or cytoplasmic cAMP affect HH signaling in tissues beyond the somites, we examined how cAMP affects HH-dependent cell fates in the developing neural tube. In vertebrates, Shh produced in the notochord and medial floor plate patterns the ventral neural tube ( Figure S2 E) ( Briscoe et al., 2000 14. Briscoe, J. ∙ Pierani, A. ∙ Jessell, T.M. ...

Two critical periods of Sonic Hedgehog signaling required for the specification of motor neuron identity Cell. 1996; 87 :661-673 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (734) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lateral floor plate cells expressing nkx2.2b are specified by high HH signaling, and neighboring motor neuron progenitor cells expressing olig2 are specified by lower HH signaling ( Guner and Karlstrom, 2007 36. Guner, B. ∙ Karlstrom, R.O. Cloning of zebrafish nkx6.2 and a comprehensive analysis of the conserved transcriptional response to Hedgehog/Gli signaling in the zebrafish neural tube Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7 :596-605 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Odenthal et al., 2000 77. Odenthal, J. ∙ van Eeden, F.J.M. ∙ Haffter, P. ... Two distinct cell populations in the floor plate of the zebrafish are induced by different pathways Dev. Biol. 2000; 219 :350-363 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). As in somite development, neither embryos expressing Cyto-bPAC and stimulated with light nor embryos expressing Cilia-bPAC and raised in the dark exhibited perturbation of HH-mediated patterning of the neural tube ( Figures S2 F and S2G). In contrast, Cilia-bPAC embryos treated with light exhibited decreased expression of both nkx2.2b and olig2 ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Thus, in neural tube patterning, as in somite patterning, cilium-generated cAMP but not cytoplasm-generated cAMP preferentially inhibits HH signaling. We conclude that zebrafish cells interpret cAMP generated in the cilium differently from cAMP generated in the cytoplasm.
To assess whether mammalian cells also differentially interpret cilium- and cytoplasm-generated cAMP, we generated NIH/3T3 cell lines stably expressing either GFP-tagged Cyto-bPAC or Cilia-bPAC. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed that, as in zebrafish, Cyto-bPAC localized to the cytoplasm and Cilia-bPAC localized to the cilium ( Figure 3 A). Immunoblot revealed that Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC are expressed at comparable levels ( Figure 3 B). Blue light stimulation of Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC cell lines generated similar levels of cAMP, as measured by ELISA ( Figure 3 C).
Because cAMP is highly diffusible and no membrane barrier exists between the cilium and the cytoplasm ( Marley et al., 2013 63. Marley, A. ∙ Choy, R.W.-Y. ∙ von Zastrow, M. GPR88 reveals a discrete function of primary cilia as selective insulators of GPCR cross-talk PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e70857 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), we predicted that cAMP generated in the cilium can enter the cytoplasm and vice versa. To test this hypothesis, we visualized cAMP dynamics in the cilium and cytoplasm upon Cyto-bPAC or Cilia-bPAC activation. To record cAMP levels independent of blue light stimulation of bPAC, we utilized a red fluorescent cAMP indicator, Pink Flamindo (pink fluorescent cAMP indicator) ( Harada et al., 2017 39. Harada, K. ∙ Ito, M. ∙ Wang, X. ... Red fluorescent protein-based cAMP indicator applicable to optogenetics and in vivo imaging Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :7351 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). cAMP increases Pink Flamindo fluorescence and, as expected, stimulating Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC with blue light induced similar increases in Pink Flamindo fluorescence ( Figure S3 A).
To generate a ratiometric cAMP biosensor targeted to cilia, we fused it to RAB23 Q68L, which constitutively localizes to cilia, and a far-red fluorescent protein mIFP to generate Ciliary Pink Flamindo ( Lim and Tang, 2015 61. Lim, Y.S. ∙ Tang, B.L. A role for Rab23 in the trafficking of Kif17 to the primary cilium J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128 :2996-3008 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2015 106. Yu, D. ∙ Baird, M.A. ∙ Allen, J.R. ... A naturally monomeric infrared fluorescent protein for protein labeling in vivo Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :763-765 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, forskolin increased the ratio of Pink Flamindo to mIFP fluorescence at the cilium ( Figures S3 B and S3C). To measure cAMP diffusion between the cytoplasm and cilium, we deployed Ciliary Pink Flamindo in Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC cells. Consistent with the absence of barriers to cAMP diffusion between the cytoplasm and the cilium, stimulating Cyto-bPAC increased Ciliary Pink Flamindo fluorescence ( Figure 3 D). Interestingly, Cyto-bPAC activation did not increase Ciliary Pink Flamindo fluorescence to the same levels as did Cilia-bPAC activation ( Figure 3 D). Thus, cAMP produced in the cytoplasm diffuses into the cilium but does not reach levels equivalent to those caused by local production.
As cilium-generated cAMP specifically inhibits HH-dependent patterning in zebrafish embryos, we investigated whether cilium-generated or cytoplasm-generated cAMP inhibits HH signal transduction in mammalian cells. To this end, we treated wild-type, Cyto-bPAC- or Cilia-bPAC-expressing cells with the Smoothened agonist SAG. Each cell line equivalently induced Gli1 , a HH target gene, in response to SAG, indicating that neither unstimulated bPAC nor its ciliary targeting sequence perturbs HH signaling ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Stimulating Cyto-bPAC-expressing cells with blue light had no effect on SAG-mediated induction of Gli1 ( Figures 3 E and 3F). In contrast, stimulating Cilia-bPAC-expressing cells with blue light inhibited SAG-mediated induction of Gli1 ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Thus, as in zebrafish, cilium-produced cAMP preferentially inhibits HH signal transduction in mammalian cells.
To investigate how cilium-produced cAMP preferentially inhibits HH signal transduction, we examined whether cAMP affects the trafficking of SMO and GPR161 at cilia. In the absence of HH stimulation, the GPCR GPR161 accumulates in cilia ( Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013 71. Mukhopadhyay, S. ∙ Wen, X. ∙ Ratti, N. ... The ciliary G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr161 negatively regulates the Sonic hedgehog pathway via cAMP signaling Cell. 2013; 152 :210-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Addition of HH ligand causes coordinated trafficking of SMO into cilia and GPR161 out of cilia ( Corbit et al., 2005 22. Corbit, K.C. ∙ Aanstad, P. ∙ Singla, V. ... Vertebrate Smoothened functions at the primary cilium Nature. 2005; 437 :1018-1021 Crossref Scopus (989) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pal et al., 2016 79. Pal, K. ∙ Hwang, S.H. ∙ Somatilaka, B. ... Smoothened determines β-arrestin-mediated removal of the G protein-coupled receptor Gpr161 from the primary cilium J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :861-875 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether ciliary cAMP impacts trafficking of SMO or GPR161 to or from cilia, we quantified SMO and GPR161 fluorescence at the cilium in wild-type, Cyto-bPAC, and Cilia-bPAC-expressing cells, both with and without SAG. SMO robustly localized to cilia in the presence of SAG ( Figures S3 D and S3E). Stimulation of wild-type, Cyto-bPAC, or Cilia-bPAC cells with blue light did not attenuate SAG-induced ciliary localization of SMO ( Figures S3 D and S3E). GPR161 localized to cilia in vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells and not on SAG treatment ( Figures S3 F and S3G). Stimulation of wild-type, Cyto-bPAC, and Cilia-bPAC cells with blue light in the presence of SAG did not attenuate GPR161 exit from cilia ( Figures S3 F and S3G). Therefore, ciliary cAMP does not affect the regulated ciliary trafficking of SMO or GPR161.
In the absence of HH, GLI3 is proteolytically processed to form GLI3 R , a truncated form that functions as a transcriptional repressor of HH transcriptional targets ( Dai et al., 1999 23.

To determine whether cilium- or cytoplasm-generated cAMP affects GLI3 processing, we activated HH signaling in wild-type, Cyto-bPAC-expressing or Cilia-bPAC-expressing cells using SAG either with or without blue light stimulation and immunoblotted for GLI3. In the absence of blue light, SAG reduced GLI3 R in all three cell lines ( Figures 3 G and 3H). Blue light had no effect on this reduction of GLI3 R in wild-type or Cyto-bPAC-expressing cells ( Figures 3 G and 3H). In contrast, blue light blocked the SAG-induced reduction of GLI3 R in Cilia-bPAC-expressing cells ( Figures 3 G and 3H). Thus, ciliary cAMP generation specifically inhibits HH signal transduction downstream of SMO and GPR161 trafficking and upstream of GLI3 processing.
If cilium-generated cAMP specifically inhibits the HH pathway, we hypothesized that ciliary GPCRs should regulate the HH pathway, but plasma membrane GPCRs should not. To test this hypothesis, we developed cilium- and plasma membrane-localized versions of a Gαs-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD). DREADDs are GPCRs engineered to be selectively activated by the otherwise pharmacologically inert drug clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) ( Armbruster et al., 2007 4. Armbruster, B.N. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Pausch, M.H. ... Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

DREADDs for Neuroscientists Neuron. 2016; 89 :683-694 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (557) PubMed Google Scholar ). On binding of CNO, Gαs-coupled DREADD activates the production of cAMP ( Guettier et al., 2009 35. Guettier, J.M. ∙ Gautam, D. ∙ Scarselli, M. ... A chemical-genetic approach to study G protein regulation of β cell function in vivo Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :19197-19202 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). To localize Gαs-coupled DREADD to cilia, we fused it to the ciliary protein ARL13B and GFP (hereafter referred to as Cilia-DREADD) ( Figure 4 A). We generated NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell lines stably expressing GFP-tagged Cilia-DREADD or DREADD without ARL13B (hereafter referred to as plasma membrane- or PM-DREADD). Immunofluorescence imaging confirmed that, as expected, PM-DREADD localized to the plasma membrane and Cilia-DREADD localized to the cilium ( Figures 4 B and S4 A). Immunoblotting whole-cell lysates from PM-DREADD- and Cilia-DREADD-expressing cells for the GFP tag indicated that the DREADDs are expressed at similar levels ( Figure S4 B).
To test whether Cilia-DREADD can activate G proteins, we expressed mini-G s , a fluorescently tagged engineered G protein that is recruited to active GPCRs ( Carpenter and Tate, 2016 19. Carpenter, B. ∙ Tate, C.G. Engineering a minimal G protein to facilitate crystallisation of G protein-coupled receptors in their active conformation Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2016; 29 :583-594 PubMed Google Scholar ; Wan et al., 2018 98. Wan, Q. ∙ Okashah, N. ∙ Inoue, A. ... Mini G protein probes for active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in live cells J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :7466-7473 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Cilia-DREADD-expressing cells, CNO induced translocation of mApple-tagged mini-G s to the cilium ( Figures S4 C and S4D). Thus, Cilia-DREADD adopts an active conformation in the cilium specifically on ligand binding. Importantly, PM-DREADD- and Cilia-DREADD-expressing cells with CNO generated equivalent amounts of cAMP ( Figure 4 C). Activating either DREADD with CNO did not affect cell survival or ciliary length ( Figures S4 E and S4F).
Because we had found that ciliary, but not cytoplasmic, cAMP regulated HH signaling, we hypothesized that ciliary, but not plasma membrane, GPCR signaling would regulate HH signaling. To begin to test whether ciliary and nonciliary GPCRs can modulate HH pathway activity, we treated wild-type, PM-DREADD-, or Cilia-DREADD-expressing NIH/3T3 cells with SAG. Each cell line induced Gli1 in response ( Figure 4 D). Treatment with CNO alone did not affect basal Gli1 expression ( Figure S4 G). Activating PM-DREADD with CNO in the presence of SAG did not affect Gli1 induction ( Figures 4 D and 4E). In contrast, activating Cilia-DREADD with CNO inhibited the ability of SAG to induce Gli1 ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Thus, as with cAMP, ciliary GPCR activity specifically affects HH signal transduction.
Whereas Gαs-coupled GPCRs, such as Cilia- and PM-DREADDs, stimulate cAMP production, Gαi-coupled GPCRs inhibit cAMP production. Because Cilia-DREADD, a ciliary Gαs-coupled GPCR, inhibits the HH pathway, we hypothesized that a ciliary Gαi-coupled GPCR would activate the HH pathway. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the activity of SSTR3, a Gαi-coupled GPCR that localizes to primary cilia ( Berbari et al., 2008 11. Berbari, N.F. ∙ Johnson, A.D. ∙ Lewis, J.S. ...

Biol. 2015; 36 :223-235 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Händel et al., 1999 38. Händel, M. ∙ Schulz, S. ∙ Stanarius, A. ... Selective targeting of somatostatin receptor 3 to neuronal cilia Neuroscience. 1999; 89 :909-926 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). We utilized NIH/3T3 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged SSTR3 ( Figure 4 F). As expected, activating SSTR3 with somatostatin opposed forskolin-mediated induction of cAMP, confirming that SSTR3 is Gαi-coupled ( Figure 4 G). We stimulated wild-type or SSTR3-expressing cells with somatostatin and assayed HH pathway activity. Wild-type cells showed increased expression of the HH target gene Gli1 in response to SAG, but not somatostatin. However, stimulating SSTR3-expressing cells with somatostatin induced Gli1 expression to similar levels as treatment with SAG ( Figure 4 H). Thus, whereas ciliary cAMP inhibits the HH transcriptional response, activating a ciliary Gαi-coupled GPCR activates the HH transcriptional response.
Together, these experiments with engineered and natural GPCRs further support the conclusion, demonstrated above using subcellular control of cAMP generation, that ciliary and nonciliary cAMP convey separate information to the cell. Additionally, the ability of a ciliary Gαi-coupled GPCR to activate the HH transcriptional response and a ciliary Gαs-coupled GPCR to do the opposite indicates that HH signal transduction is responsive to both increases and decreases in ciliary cAMP.
The diffusibility of cAMP between the cytoplasm and the cilium would seem to preclude the cell from distinguishing subcellular pools, critical for the ability of separate pools to impart distinct information ( Marley et al., 2013 63. Marley, A. ∙ Choy, R.W.-Y. ∙ von Zastrow, M. GPR88 reveals a discrete function of primary cilia as selective insulators of GPCR cross-talk PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e70857 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate how the cell may distinguish ciliary and extraciliary cAMP even without barriers to its intracellular movement, we constructed a computational model of a ciliated cell and modeled the kinetics of how ciliary and extraciliary cAMP activate a cAMP effector protein, such as PKA, at the cilium ( Figure 5 A; Table S1 ). Our model illustrated that the ∼13-fold greater surface to volume ratio of the cilium can account for more efficient activation of a ciliary cAMP effector protein by ciliary cAMP than by nonciliary cAMP ( Figures 5 A, S5 A, and S5B). Interestingly, this difference in effector sensitivity did not require differences in ciliary and nonciliary diffusion or PKA concentrations but did depend on both ciliary length and diameter ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Thus, the different geometries of the cilium and cell body may allow cells to differentially activate cAMP effector proteins at the cilium and cell body.
One prediction of this computational model is that producing supraphysiological levels of cAMP will overcome the geometric differences preventing cytoplasmic cAMP from triggering ciliary effectors ( Figures S5 E and S5F; Table S2 ). To test this prediction, we shined more light on Cilia-bPAC- or Cyto-bPAC-expressing zebrafish embryos. Increasing the amount of blue light delivered to Cilia-bPAC-expressing zebrafish embryos 5.4-fold or 13.4-fold further reduced the number of En-expressing somite cells and blocked En-expressing cell formation at the high level ( Figure S5 G). As predicted by the model, stimulating Cyto-bPAC-expressing zebrafish embryos with more light attenuated the number of En-expressing somite cells ( Figure S5 G). Interestingly, even at the highest amount of light, Cilia-bPAC more potently inhibited the induction of En-expressing cells ( Figure S5 G). Similarly, in Cilia-DREADD-expressing NIH/3T3 cells, treatment with 20-fold increased concentrations of CNO further inhibited Gli1 induction in response to SAG ( Figure S5 H). As predicted by the model, treatment with high concentrations of CNO also attenuated relative Gli1 induction in response to SAG in PM-DREADD cells ( Figure S5 H). These results suggest that differential interpretation of cAMP generated inside and outside of the cilium can be overwhelmed by high, possibly supraphysiological concentrations of cAMP.
Because the model suggested that even in the absence of a barrier to cAMP diffusion, differences in geometry can account for differential activation of a ciliary cAMP effector by ciliary- and nonciliary-generated cAMP, we investigated whether the cAMP effector PKA was present in the cilium. In its inactive state, PKA is comprised of regulatory (e.g., PKA-RIα) and catalytic subunits (e.g., PKA-Cα) bound to an A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) ( Taylor et al., 2012 91. Taylor, S.S. ∙ Ilouz, R. ∙ Zhang, P. ... Assembly of allosteric macromolecular switches: lessons from PKA Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 :646-658 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wong and Scott, 2004 103. Wong, W. ∙ Scott, J.D. AKAP signalling complexes: focal points in space and time Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5 :959-970 Crossref Scopus (785) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether PKA can localize to cilia, we co-expressed PKA-RIα, PKA-Cα, and the previously described ciliary AKAP GPR161 in NIH/3T3 cells ( Bachmann et al., 2016 6. Bachmann, V.A. ∙ Mayrhofer, J.E. ∙ Ilouz, R. ... Gpr161 anchoring of PKA consolidates GPCR and cAMP signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :7786-7791 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Co-expressed PKA-RIα and PKA-Cα co-localized with GPR161 in cilia ( Figures S6 A–S6C), suggesting that a ciliary pool of PKA may allow the cell to discriminate between ciliary and cytoplasmic cAMP.
Previous work suggested that PKA acts at the basal body to regulate HH output, because PKA antibody staining shows an enrichment at the ciliary base ( Barzi et al., 2010 10. Barzi, M. ∙ Berenguer, J. ∙ Menendez, A. ... Sonic-hedgehog-mediated proliferation requires the localization of PKA to the cilium base J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 :62-69 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tuson et al., 2011 95. Tuson, M. ∙ He, M. ∙ Anderson, K.V. Protein kinase A acts at the basal body of the primary cilium to prevent Gli2 activation and ventralization of the mouse neural tube Development. 2011; 138 :4921-4930 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test where within the cell PKA regulates HH signal transduction, we targeted dominant negative PKA (dnPKA), a constitutively repressive version of PKA-RIα that is insensitive to cAMP ( Clegg et al., 1987 21. Clegg, C.H. ∙ Correll, L.A. ∙ Cadd, G.G. ... Inhibition of intracellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase using mutant genes of the regulatory type I subunit J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262 :13111-13119 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ungar and Moon, 1996 97. Ungar, A.R. ∙ Moon, R.T. Inhibition of protein kinase A phenocopies ectopic expression of hedgehog in the CNS of wild-type and cyclops mutant embryos Dev. Biol. 1996; 178 :186-191 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), to three subcellular locations: the basal body, the cilium, and outside of the cilium ( Figure 5 B). More specifically, we targeted dnPKA to the to the basal body by fusing it to tandem PACT domains ( Gillingham and Munro, 2000 32. Gillingham, A.K. ∙ Munro, S. The PACT domain, a conserved centrosomal targeting motif in the coiled-coil proteins AKAP450 and pericentrin EMBO Rep. 2000; 1 :524-529 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To target dnPKA to the cilium, we fused it to RAB23 Q68L, which constitutively localizes to cilia ( Lim and Tang, 2015 61. Lim, Y.S. ∙ Tang, B.L. A role for Rab23 in the trafficking of Kif17 to the primary cilium J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128 :2996-3008 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). To exclude dnPKA from the cilium, we fused it to RAB23 S23N, which localizes to the cell body ( Leaf and Von Zastrow, 2015 59. Leaf, A. ∙ Von Zastrow, M. Dopamine receptors reveal an essential role of IFT-B, KIF17, and Rab23 in delivering specific receptors to primary cilia eLife. 2015; 4 :e06996 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expression of either RAB23 S23N or RAB23 Q68L by themselves in zebrafish did not modulate HH signaling ( Figures S6 D–S6F). To assess the subcellular localization of the targeted forms of dnPKA, we expressed GFP-tagged versions in zebrafish embryos and assessed subcellular localization. As anticipated, dnPKA-GFP-2x PACT localized to the ciliary base, dnPKA-GFP-RAB23 Q68L localized to cilia, and dnPKA-GFP-RAB23 S23N was extraciliary ( Figure 5 C). Therefore, we subsequently refer to these three forms of dnPKA as Basal Body dnPKA, Ciliary dnPKA, and Extraciliary dnPKA, respectively.
We hypothesized that, if ciliary PKA responds to ciliary cAMP to inhibit HH signaling, then blocking PKA within the cilium, but not at the basal body or outside the cilium, would activate the HH pathway. To begin to test this hypothesis, we assessed how inhibiting different subcellular pools of PKA affected the Gli:mCherry reporter of HH signaling in zebrafish embryos. Consistent with earlier reports, expression of GFP alone did not affect HH pathway activity and expression of untargeted dnPKA-GFP increased HH pathway activity ( Figures 5 D and 5G) ( Barresi et al., 2000 8. Barresi, M.J. ∙ Stickney, H.L. ∙ Devoto, S.H. The zebrafish slow-muscle-omittedgene product is required for Hedgehogsignal transduction and the development of slow muscle identit Development. 2000; 27 :2189-2199 Crossref Google Scholar ; Du et al., 1997 26. Du, S.J. ∙ Devoto, S.H. ∙ Westerfield, M. ... Positive and negative regulation of muscle cell identity by members of the hedgehog and TGF-β gene families J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139 :145-156 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neither Basal Body dnPKA nor Extraciliary dnPKA affected Gli:mCherry reporter activity ( Figures 5 D and 5G). In contrast, expression of equivalent amounts of Ciliary dnPKA, as assayed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence quantification, expanded Gli:mCherry reporter activity ( Figures 5 D–5G).
To assess whether ciliary PKA regulates, in addition to HH signal transduction, HH-mediated patterning, we examined whether inhibiting PKA in different subcellular locations affects somite patterning. Consistent with previous reports, expression of untargeted dnPKA-GFP increased the number of En-expressing cells per somite ( Figures 5 D and 5H) ( Hammerschmidt et al., 1996 37. Hammerschmidt, M. ∙ Bitgood, M.J. ∙ McMahon, A.P. Protein kinase A is a common negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling in the vertebrate embryo Genes Dev. 1996; 10 :647-658 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Extraciliary and Basal Body dnPKA did not affect numbers of En-expressing cells. In contrast, Ciliary dnPKA increased En-expressing cells ( Figures 5 D and 5H). Because inhibiting PKA in the cilium, but not elsewhere, activates GLI-dependent transcription and increases a HH-dependent fate, we conclude that a ciliary pool of PKA specifically regulates the HH pathway.
Because we had found that ciliary PKA controls HH signal transduction, we hypothesized that ciliary PKA specifically interprets ciliary cAMP. However, Drosophila PKA acts in the HH pathway independent of cAMP ( Jiang and Struhl, 1995 48. Jiang, J. ∙ Struhl, G. Protein kinase A and hedgehog signaling in Drosophila limb development Cell. 1995; 80 :563-572 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). We predicted that if vertebrate ciliary PKA acts differently from Drosophila PKA and interprets ciliary cAMP levels, inhibiting ciliary PKA, but not extraciliary PKA, would restore HH-dependent cell fates suppressed by ciliary cAMP.
To begin to test the hypothesis that vertebrate PKA interprets ciliary cAMP, we made use of Cilia-bPAC transgenic embryos. Consistent with prior results, light-stimulated Cilia-bPAC transgenic embryos formed fewer HH-dependent high En-expressing cells than Cilia-bPAC transgenic embryos not stimulated with light ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Injection of untargeted dnPKA-GFP mRNA into Cilia-bPAC embryos stimulated with light restored the number of high En-expressing cells. Thus, cAMP affects HH-dependent patterning through activating PKA.
To address whether ciliary and extraciliary PKA respond differently to cilium- and cytoplasm-produced cAMP, we injected Cilia-bPAC transgenic embryos with mRNA encoding Basal Body, Extraciliary, or Ciliary dnPKA and stimulated them with light. Expression of Basal Body or Extraciliary dnPKA did not restore En-expressing cells. In contrast, expression of Ciliary dnPKA specifically restored formation of En-expressing cells in Cilia-bPAC transgenic embryos treated with light ( Figures 6 A and 6B). These data demonstrate that ciliary PKA interprets ciliary cAMP to regulate vertebrate HH signal transduction in vivo .

Section: Discussion

The primary cilium transduces some forms of intercellular signaling, including signaling via the HH pathway and select ciliary GPCRs ( Gigante and Caspary, 2020 30. Gigante, E.D. ∙ Caspary, T. Signaling in the primary cilium through the lens of the Hedgehog pathway Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Dev. Biol. 2020; 9 :e377 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ciliary signals are transduced through diffusible second messengers, such as cAMP and calcium, which are shared with nonciliary signaling, raising the question of whether cells distinguish ciliary and extraciliary signaling. To investigate whether cells distinguish ciliary and extraciliary cAMP, we engineered optogenetic and chemogenetic tools that enable precise spatiotemporal control of cAMP production or GPCR activation specifically inside or outside of cilia.
Using the optogenetic tools in zebrafish development revealed that activating cAMP production in cilia, but not outside cilia, preferentially inhibited HH signal transduction and HH-dependent cell fate specification in vivo . Similarly, in mammalian cells, generating cAMP in cilia, but not outside cilia, inhibited HH signal transduction. Thus, cilia-generated cAMP is functionally distinct from cAMP produced in the cytoplasm, and the information content of cAMP depends on its site of origin.
The conventional view of GPCR signaling is that coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins occurs at the plasma membrane ( Neves et al., 2002 73. Neves, S.R. ∙ Ram, P.T. ∙ Iyengar, R. G protein pathways Science. 2002; 296 :1636-1639 Crossref Scopus (887) PubMed Google Scholar ). The primary ciliary membrane is contiguous to, but compositionally distinct from, the plasma membrane. To directly test how ciliary and plasma membrane GPCRs may function differently, we engineered a Gαs-coupled DREADD localized to either the ciliary or plasma membranes. Interestingly, we found that ciliary DREADD activation preferentially inhibited HH target gene induction. Thus, both subcellularly targeted bPAC and DREADDs reveal that the cell distinguishes between equivalent amounts of cilium-generated and nonciliary cAMP ( Figure 6 C).
We conclude that, by discriminating between ciliary and plasma membrane production of cAMP, cells independently interpret GPCR-mediated information in these two compartments even though both are transduced through a common, diffusible second messenger. In addition to SSTR3 and GPR161, ∼30 GPCRs localize to primary cilia ( Hilgendorf et al., 2016 42. Hilgendorf, K.I. ∙ Johnson, C.T. ∙ Jackson, P.K. The primary cilium as a cellular receiver: organizing ciliary GPCR signaling Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 39 :84-92 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mykytyn and Askwith, 2017 72. Mykytyn, K. ∙ Askwith, C. G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling in Cilia Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9 :a028183 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously demonstrated that one of these, MC4R, operates at the primary cilia of hypothalamic neurons to trigger satiety and control feeding behavior ( Siljee et al., 2018 88. Siljee, J.E. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Bernard, A.A. ... Subcellular localization of MC4R with ADCY3 at neuronal primary cilia underlies a common pathway for genetic predisposition to obesity Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :180-185 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that the dependence of MC4R and other cilium-localized GPCRs on the cilium reflects the fact that their physiological effects are mediated, like HH patterning, specifically by ciliary cAMP.
One possible explanation for how cells differentially interpret equivalent amounts of cAMP produced in the cilium or cytoplasm would be if the ciliary transition zone, in addition to controlling protein trafficking between the cilium and cell body, also prevented the free diffusion of cAMP. However, the use of the Ciliary Pink Flamindo cAMP biosensor revealed that no barrier to cAMP diffusion exists. Instead, our computational model suggested that ciliary PKA can be specifically activated by ciliary cAMP to generate specific outputs, such as modulating HH signal transduction. Generating an equal amount of cAMP in the cilium or cytoplasm is expected to result in a higher local concentration in the cilium due to the ∼5,000-fold difference in volume. Thus, even in the absence of a barrier to the free diffusion of cAMP separating the two compartments or differences in PKA concentration, ciliary PKA is differentially sensitive to ciliary cAMP.
In addition, as adenylyl cyclases are integral membrane proteins and the ratio of membrane area to cytosol volume is higher for a cylindrical cilium than for a spherical cell, the different geometries of the two compartments are also expected to contribute to differential sensitivity of ciliary PKA to ciliary GPCR activity. Our modeling further suggests that the length and diameter of the cilium tunes the cell’s differential sensitivity to ciliary and nonciliary cAMP. Similarly, modeling of neurons indicates that the length and diameter of dendrites and their spines affects cAMP-regulated calcium dynamics ( Neves et al., 2008 74. Neves, S.R. ∙ Tsokas, P. ∙ Sarkar, A. ...

J. 2019; 117 :1981-1994 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the model we computed does not incorporate the possibility that different adenylyl cyclases generate different basal levels of cAMP in the cell body and cilium, nor account for the possibility of differential sensitivity of PKA to cAMP ( Jiang et al., 2019 50. Jiang, J.Y. ∙ Falcone, J.L. ∙ Curci, S. ... Direct visualization of cAMP signaling in primary cilia reveals up-regulation of ciliary GPCR activity following Hedgehog activation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cilia have high cAMP levels that are inhibited by Sonic Hedgehog-regulated calcium dynamics Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PKA is a prominent effector of cAMP and an evolutionarily conserved regulator of the HH pathway ( Hammerschmidt et al., 1996 37. Hammerschmidt, M. ∙ Bitgood, M.J. ∙ McMahon, A.P.

Function of protein kinase A in hedgehog signal transduction and Drosophila imaginal disc development Cell. 1995; 80 :553-562 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). PKA prominently localizes to the basal body, where it has been proposed to inhibit the HH pathway ( Tuson et al., 2011 95. Tuson, M. ∙ He, M. ∙ Anderson, K.V.

Time-resolved proteomics profiling of the ciliary Hedgehog response Journal of Cell Biology. 2021; 220 In press Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether PKA acts at the basal body or cilium to interpret ciliary cAMP, we targeted dnPKA to the basal body, the cilium, or outside of cilia in zebrafish embryos. Whereas inhibiting PKA outside the cilium or at the basal body had no effect on HH signal transduction, blocking PKA within the cilium specifically activated HH signal transduction and expanded HH-dependent cell fates. Moreover, blocking PKA in the cilium restored En-expressing cells suppressed by Cilia-bPAC stimulation, indicating that a functionally distinct pool of PKA within the cilium interprets ciliary cAMP. Importantly, blocking PKA in the cilium was sufficient to perturb HH signaling downstream of endogenous cAMP concentrations in the developing embryo.
We conclude that a ciliary pool of PKA is regulated specifically by ciliary cAMP to control HH signal transduction, and this local interpretation allows ciliary and extraciliary cAMP to impart different information to the cell. Ultimately, it is likely that ciliary PKA activity is communicated to the cell via regulation of GLI transcription factors that move from the cilium to the nucleus ( Figure 6 C) ( Aza-Blanc et al., 1997 5.

Consistent with this possibility, we found that generating cAMP in the cilium specifically affected GLI3 proteolytic processing. The finding that ciliary cAMP promotes GLI3 processing does not exclude the possibility that ciliary cAMP also inhibits GLI2 activation, especially as the fates inhibited by ciliary cAMP in the somite and neural tube partially depend on GLI2 activation ( Karlstrom et al., 2003 52.

It will be interesting to assess whether other second messengers use specific local effectors to distinguish the information content of different subcellular pools. Calcium may be another example, as it, like cAMP, diffuses and its concentration within the cilium and cell body can be independently regulated to have distinct biological effects ( Delling et al., 2013 24.

This work reveals that ciliary cAMP, but not cytoplasmic cAMP, preferentially inhibits HH signaling in vivo . Ciliary cAMP activates PKA in the cilium to modulate HH signaling. More generally, our results reveal that cells differentially interpret cAMP generated in different subcellular domains, allowing for a shared second messenger to denote different meanings to the cell.
The mathematical model of activation of PKA by ciliary and nonciliary cAMP assumed that the diffusion constant of cAMP in cilia is similar to that measured in cytoplasm and that ciliary ATP is not limiting. Moreover, our model did not incorporate phosphodiesterase function because the k cat , V max , and subcellular locale of many phosphodiesterases are poorly defined. To investigate the ciliary and nonciliary functions of cAMP and PKA, we used multiple orthogonal tools that we localized to cilia, cytosol, or plasma membrane using a variety of mechanisms. A small proportion of each may not localize to the principal subcellular location, and this subpopulation may contribute to the observed outputs. The recapitulation of key results using bPAC, a GPCR (SSTR3) and chemogenetic tools (DREADDs) suggests that levels of ciliary cAMP generated in this work are physiological. Confirming that the experimentally produced ciliary cAMP levels are physiological will require measuring ciliary cAMP concentrations in cilia under different signaling conditions.

Adult Danio rerio zebrafish were maintained under standard laboratory conditions. Embryos were maintained at 28°C and staged as described previously ( Kimmel et al., 1995 55. Kimmel, C.B. ∙ Ballard, W.W. ∙ Kimmel, S.R. ... Stages of embryonic development of the zebrafish Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203 :253-310 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC transgenic zebrafish were raised in the dark until 5 days post fertilization, and then maintained on a 14h light/10h dark cycle. Zebrafish of Ekkwill (EKW) background were used as wild-type. Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC transgenic lines were maintained on an EKW background. Gli:mCherry ( Tg(8xGliBS:mCherry-NLS-Odc1 )) transgenic zebrafish were a gift from James Chen ( Mich et al., 2014 67. Mich, J.K. ∙ Payumo, A.Y. ∙ Rack, P.G. ... In vivo imaging of Hedgehog pathway activation with a nuclear fluorescent reporter PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e103661 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Embryos were maintained in egg water containing 60 μg/mL sea salt (Instant Ocean) in distilled water. For forskolin treatment, embryos were incubated in forskolin dissolved in DMSO from 6 hours post fertilization (hpf) until 24hpf. Experimental zebrafish embryos typically were less than 24hpf, a stage at which sex cannot be readily determined and is unlikely to influence the biological processes under study. All zebrafish protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California, San Francisco.
NIH/3T3 Flp-In cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with high glucose (GIBCO Cat# 11965118) supplemented with 10% newborn bovine calf serum (GIBCO Cat# 16010159) and GlutaMAX supplement (GIBCO Cat# 35050061). Cells were grown in the absence of antibiotics. To induce ciliation, cells were grown to confluence and starved overnight in Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (UCSF Cell Culture Facility).
We amplified bPAC and full length human ARL13B (PfuUltra II, Stratagene) and cloned the amplicons into pDONR221 using BP Clonase II (ThermoFisher) to create pENTR-Cyto-bPAC-6x Myc and pENTR-Cilia-bPAC-6x Myc. bPAC was a gift from Mark von Zastrow ( Tsvetanova and von Zastrow, 2014 94. Tsvetanova, N.G. ∙ von Zastrow, M. Spatial encoding of cyclic AMP signaling specificity by GPCR endocytosis Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 :1061-1065 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate transposons, we combined pENTR-Cyto-bPAC or pENTR-Cilia-bPAC with p5E-Ub, Tol2 and p3E-MT-pA using LR Clonase II Plus (ThermoFisher Scientific) ( Kwan et al., 2007 58. Kwan, K.M. ∙ Fujimoto, E. ∙ Grabher, C. ... The Tol2kit: a multisite gateway-based construction kit for Tol2 transposon transgenesis constructs Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236 :3088-3099 Crossref Scopus (1009) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clones were verified by sequencing (Integrated DNA Technologies).
For generating NIH/3T3 Flp-In cell lines expressing bPAC, Cyto-bPAC-GFP and Cilia-bPAC-GFP were cloned into a version of pGLAP5 (gift from Peter Jackson, Addgene Cat# 19706) with a minimal chicken lens δ-crystallin promoter ( Ye et al., 2018 104. Ye, F. ∙ Nager, A.R. ∙ Nachury, M.V. BBSome trains remove activated GPCRs from cilia by enabling passage through the transition zone J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :1847-1868 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara). To generate a red-shifted ratiometric ciliary cAMP sensor, Pink Flamindo was fused to monomeric infrared fluorescent protein (mIFP) and RAB23 Q68L using In-Fusion. mIFP and RAB23 Q68L were gifts from Xiaokun Shu and Carol Wicking, respectively ( Evans et al., 2003 28. Evans, T.M. ∙ Ferguson, C. ∙ Wainwright, B.J. ...

Yu, D. ∙ Baird, M.A. ∙ Allen, J.R. ... A naturally monomeric infrared fluorescent protein for protein labeling in vivo Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :763-765 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Both Ciliary Pink Flamindo and Pink Flamindo alone were cloned into lentiviral vector pLVX to generate pLVX-Pink Flamindo-mIFP-RAB23 Q68L and pLVX-Pink Flamindo, respectively. Lentivirus was generated using the Lenti-X packaging single shot kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Takara).
For generating mRNA encoding ARL13B-bPAC-6xMyc, ARL13B-bPAC-6xMyc was cloned into the pCS2+8 expression vector using In-Fusion HD. The nonciliary control, ARL13B V359A -bPAC-6x Myc, was subsequently generated by site-directed mutagenesis using In-Fusion. To generate ciliary, nonciliary, and basal body dnPKA constructs, Rab23 or tandem PACT domains were appended to the 3′ end of pCS2+-dnPKA-GFP ( Ungar and Moon, 1996 97. Ungar, A.R. ∙ Moon, R.T. Inhibition of protein kinase A phenocopies ectopic expression of hedgehog in the CNS of wild-type and cyclops mutant embryos Dev. Biol. 1996; 178 :186-191 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) using In-Fusion. dnPKA is a version of PKA-RIα (Prkar1a) containing mutations at cAMP binding sites (Addgene #16716) ( Clegg et al., 1987 21. Clegg, C.H. ∙ Correll, L.A. ∙ Cadd, G.G. ... Inhibition of intracellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase using mutant genes of the regulatory type I subunit J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262 :13111-13119 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2x PACT was amplified from 6x Halo-EGFP-2x PACT (Addgene #107265). RAB23 Q68L and RAB23 S23N constructs were gifts from Carol Wicking ( Evans et al., 2003 28. Evans, T.M. ∙ Ferguson, C. ∙ Wainwright, B.J. ... Rab23, a negative regulator of hedgehog signaling, localizes to the plasma membrane and the endocytic pathway Traffic. 2003; 4 :869-884 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). For zebrafish injections, we synthesized capped messenger RNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion) from pCS2+ constructs linearized with Not I.
NIH/3T3 cell lines stably expressing Cyto-bPAC, Cilia-bPAC, PM-DREADD, Cilia-DREADD and SSTR3 were generated using the Flp-In system following manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, Flp-In NIH/3T3 cells (ThermoFisher) were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with the appropriate plasmids and a mouse codon-optimized FLP recombinase (gift from Philippe Soriano, Addgene Cat# 13793) and selected with 70 μg/mL hygromycin (GIBCO), with the exception of clones expressing bPAC under the control of an attenuated promoter when 40 μg/mL was used. Single colonies were expanded, and protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy for GFP (1:1000, Rockland, RRID: AB_218182 ).
To generate bPAC cell lines stably expressing Pink Flamindo-based cAMP biosensors, cells were transduced with lentivirus containing either Pink Flamindo or Ciliary Pink Flamindo in the presence of 4 μg/mL polybrene and selected with 1 μg/mL puromycin.
Transient transfections were performed using Transit-X2 transfection reagents (Mirus Bio) according to manufacturer’s instructions for NIH/3T3 cells. Plasmids encoding GPR161, PKA-RIα and PKA-Cα were generous gifts from Mark von Zastrow, Max Nachury and Roshanak Irannejad, respectively ( Irannejad et al., 2017 47. Irannejad, R. ∙ Pessino, V. ∙ Mika, D. ... Functional selectivity of GPCR-directed drug action through location bias Nat. Chem.

Cell. 2015; 35 :497-512 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). mApple-tagged Mini-G s was a generous gift from Roshanak Irannejad.
Transgenic zebrafish were generated through Tol2-based transgenesis, as previously described ( Kawakami et al., 2004 53. Kawakami, K. ∙ Takeda, H. ∙ Kawakami, N. ... A transposon-mediated gene trap approach identifies developmentally regulated genes in zebrafish Dev. Cell. 2004; 7 :133-144 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting adults were mated with wild-type EKW fish and founders transmitting Cyto-bPAC or Cilia-bPAC were identified by genotyping progeny. Genotyping was performed using DNA extracted from either dechorionated embryos or adult fins. In brief, samples were incubated in DNA extraction buffer (10mM Tris pH8.0, 2mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) supplemented with 200 μg/mL Proteinase K (Millipore Sigma) for 2 hours at 55°C. Proteinase K was inactivated by incubation at 100°C for 5 minutes. Genotyping was performed with specified primers (see Key Resources Table ) using DreamTaq Green DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher Scientific). We outcrossed founders to EKW wild-type zebrafish at least three times before experimentation. For each experiment, eggs were collected from a natural mating of one Cyto-bPAC or Cilia-bPAC transgenic animal and one EKW wild-type animal. This yielded approximately 50% transgenic embryos in each clutch. For dnPKA mRNA injections, we injected 45pg of capped mRNA at the one-cell stage. For bPAC mRNA injections, we injected 4.5pg of capped mRNA at the one-cell stage, examined localization of Nonciliary-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC at 18hpf, and stimulated with pulsed (500ms on, 500ms off) 0.35mW/cm 2 470nm blue light from 14-18hpf. For injection of Rab23 S23N and Rab23 Q68L alone, we injected 18pg of capped mRNA at the one-cell stage. We incubated injected embryos in egg water and unfertilized embryos were removed 6-8 hours post injection.
We performed optogenetic experiments in 35mm dishes using custom LED devices. Briefly, the device consisted of 1) a printed circuit board with LEDs and control circuitry positioned to illuminate six individual 35 mm dishes; 2) a 3D printed adaptor to ensure diffuse illumination and no cross-stimulation between samples; 3) an Arduino microcontroller to control the LED illumination during the experiment. The printed circuit board was designed using KiCad Electronic Design Automation software (KiCad) and manufactured by PCB Unlimited. The circuit board accommodated 10 blue/red bi-color LEDs (Wurth, Cat# 150141RB73100) under each of six 35mm wells. Groups of five LEDs were controlled by one pin of a constant-current LED driver chip (Texas Instruments, Cat# TLC5947) supporting independent 12-bit control (4096 steps) by pulse-width modulation, as used in similar devices ( Bugaj and Lim, 2019 16.

Repina, N.A. ∙ McClave, T. ∙ Bao, X. ... Engineered illumination devices for optogenetic control of cellular signaling dynamics Cell Reports. 2020; 31 In press Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). The LED drivers were controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which was programmed with a custom script written in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment. 3D printed adapters that mated the LED array with the 35 mm plates were designed using Inventor CAD software (Autodesk) and printed on a uPrint 3D printer (Stratasys).
We collected zebrafish embryos from timed natural matings and raised them in the dark. We identified transgenic lines that generate equivalent amounts of cAMP upon light stimulation. For light titration experiments, we stimulated embryos with four hours of pulsed (500ms on, 500ms off) low (0.065mW/cm 2 ), medium (0.35mW/cm 2 ) or high (0.87mW/cm 2 ) amounts of 470nm blue light. For all other activations of transgenic bPAC-expressing zebrafish, we used the low (0.065mW/cm 2 ) amount of 470nm blue light. We measured lighting power density with a digital power meter console (Thorlabs Cat# PM100D). For each zebrafish experiment, eggs were collected from a natural mating of one Cyto-bPAC or Cilia-bPAC transgenic zebrafish and one EKW wild-type zebrafish, yielding approximately 50% transgenic embryos in each clutch. For immunofluorescence analyses, we stimulated embryos from 14-18hpf, fixed at 24hpf, and assessed patterning of somites 12-15. For embryos injected with mRNA encoding either Cilia-bPAC (ARL13B-bPAC) and Nonciliary-bPAC (ARL13B V359A -bPAC), we stimulated at 14-18hpf with pulsed (500ms on, 500ms off) 0.35mW/cm 2 470nm blue light, fixed at 24hpf, and assessed patterning of somites 12-15. For cAMP measurements in transgenic animals, we stimulated embryos from 24-28hpf with 0.065mW/cm 2 light in the presence of 100 μM IBMX. For cAMP measurements in injected embryos, we stimulated embryos from 14-18hpf with 0.35mW/cm 2 470nm pulsed blue light in the presence of 100 μM IBMX.
To optogenetically stimulate bPAC-expressing NIH/3T3 cell lines, we plated cells in 35mm dishes, grew them to confluency, and serum starved overnight in Opti-MEM to promote ciliation. Prior to qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence or immunoblot analysis, we stimulated the cells for four hours of pulsed (500ms on, 500ms off) 0.14mW/cm 2 470nm blue light while incubating with the indicated drugs diluted in Opti-MEM. Prior to ELISA-based measurement of cAMP levels, we stimulated the cells with 0.87mW/cm 2 470nm blue light for 30 minutes in the presence of 100 μM IBMX.
We fixed zebrafish embryos in 4% methanol-free PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences Cat# 100504-782) diluted in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature on a nutator and then stored them in 100% methanol at −20°C until further analysis. We rehydrated embryos in a graded series of methanol and PBST (PBS+0.1% Tween) solutions (75%, 50%, 25% and 0% methanol). For Engrailed staining, we incubated embryos in −20°C acetone for 7 minutes. We blocked embryos in 10% donkey serum, 1% DMSO, 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour. After blocking, we incubated embryos overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in PBDT (1% DMSO, 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS). Primary antibodies used were: goat anti-Myc (1:500, Novus, RRID: AB_10002720 ), rabbit anti-Tub AC (1:500, Cell Signaling, RRID: AB_10544694 ), rabbit anti-mCherry (1:500, Abcam, RRID: AB_2571870 ), mouse anti-Eng (1:10, DSHB, RRID: AB_528224 ), rabbit anti-Prox1 (1:100, EMD Millipore, RRID: AB_177485 ), goat anti-GFP (1:1000, Rockland, RRID: AB_218182 ), mouse anti-γ-Tub (1:500, Sigma Aldrich, RRID: AB_477584 ). Subsequently, we incubated embryos in donkey Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Life Technologies) and Hoechst (ThermoFisher Scientific) diluted in PBDT for 2 hours at room temperature, nutating. We mounted embryos in ProLong Diamond antifade mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat# P36970).
We seeded cells on 12mm coverslips (Azer Scientific, Cat# ES0117520) at a density of 5x10 4 cells per well in a 24-well plate and starved in Opti-MEM reduced serum media (UCSF Cell Culture Facility). We transfected PKA using TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio) 24h after seeding. 48h after seeding, we starved cells overnight in Opti-MEM. We fixed cells for 10 minutes in 4% PFA diluted in PBS. We also fixed PKA-transfected cells in −20°C methanol for 3 minutes after PFA fixation. We blocked cells in 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5% BSA and PBS for 1h at room temperature. We diluted primary antibodies in blocking buffer and incubated them overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies used were goat anti-GFP (1:1000, Rockland, RRID: AB_218182 ), rabbit anti-TUB AC (1:500, Cell Signaling, RRID: AB_10544694 ), mouse anti-γ-TUB (1:500, Sigma Aldrich, RRID: AB_477584 ), mouse anti-ARL13B (1:1000, NeuroMab, RRID: AB_11000053 ), rabbit anti-FOP (1:500, ProteinTech, RRID: AB_2103362 ), mouse anti-FLAG (1:500, Sigma Aldrich, RRID: AB_439685 ), mouse anti-mNeonGreen (1:1000, ChromoTek, RRID: AB_2827566 ), mouse anti-SMO (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, RRID: AB_2239686 ), mouse anti-TUB AC (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, RRID: AB_477585 ), and rabbit anti-GPR161 (1:100, Proteintech, RRID: AB_2113965 ). Subsequently, we incubated cells in donkey Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Life Technologies) and Hoechst (ThermoFisher Scientific) diluted in blocking buffer at room temperature for 2 hours. We mounted coverslips in ProLong Diamond antifade mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat# P36970).
We imaged live zebrafish with a Zeiss Observer D1 microscope and an Axiocam MRc camera. We imaged live cells using a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal equipped with a 60x 1.4 numerical aperture oil objective, a Nikon Perfect Focus system, and a Prime95B sCMOS camera (Photometrics). We seeded cells onto 35mm dishes with Poly-D-Lysine coated No. 1.5 coverslips (MatTek Cat# P35GC-1.5-10-C). After 24h of growth, we transfected cells using Transit-X2 transfection reagents (Mirus Bio). 48h after seeding, we starved cells in Opti-MEM reduced serum media overnight. On the day of imaging, we incubated cells in SiR-Tubulin without verapamil (Spirochrome) to label cilia. During imaging, we maintained cells at 37°C and 5% CO 2 using an OkoLab Cage Incubator and CO 2 mixer. We added drugs one minute after the start of image acquisition and imaged cells every 30 s for 15 minutes in FluoroBrite DMEM (ThermoFisher Cat# A1896701) supplemented with 25mM HEPES, pH7.4 (ThermoFisher Cat# 15630080). For Ciliary Pink Flamindo and Pink Flamindo imaging, we stimulated bPAC-expressing NIH/3T3 cells with 100ms 52.7mW/cm 2 light (Axiom Optics, Argo-POWER) using the 488nm laser (Vortran) during image acquisition. For each cell, images were continuously acquired for 1 minute with the 488nm laser to stimulate bPAC, the 640nm laser to identify cilia stained either with SiR-Tubulin (in the case of cytoplasmic Pink Flamindo) or mIFP (in the case of Ciliary Pink Flamindo), and the 561nm laser to image Pink Flamindo fluorescence. bPAC stimulation began after two acquisitions of ciliary and Pink Flamindo fluorescence detection in the absence of blue laser stimulation. Cells were stimulated with 100 μM Forskolin after bPAC stimulation was completed.
We imaged fixed cells with a Zeiss LSM 800 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63x/1.4 oil immersion objective and captured using the Zen Imaging Software (Zeiss). We imaged fixed zebrafish with either a Leica TCS SPE or a Zeiss LSM 800 laser scanning confocal microscope. We imaged zebrafish somite cilia using a 63x/1.4 oil immersion objective and somites 12 through 15 using either a 20x air objective or 40x oil objective. While collecting images, we held constant the gain, offset and laser power for each antibody combination. We processed images identically and used FIJI software to generate maximal projections.
To measure cAMP concentrations in cultured cells, we used a Direct cAMP ELISA kit (Enzo, Cat# ADI-900-066) without the optional acetylation step. Prior to determining cAMP concentration in DREADD- or SSTR3-expressing cells, we seeded NIH/3T3 cells in 12-well plates at a density of 1x10 5 cells per well. For bPAC-based NIH/3T3 experiments, we seeded bPAC-expressing cells in 35mm dishes at a density of 2x10 5 cells per well. 24h after seeding, we starved cells overnight in Opti-MEM reduced serum media to promote ciliation. On the day of treatment, we treated cells with drugs or light in the presence of 10 μM IBMX for DREADD and SSTR3 experiments and 100 μM IBMX for bPAC cells (Millipore Sigma) diluted in Opti-MEM. We stimulated SSTR3-expressing cells with Somatostatin for 30 minutes. We stimulated DREADD-expressing cells with CNO for 3 hours. Immediately after stimulation, cells were scraped into lysis buffer (0.1M HCl, Enzo). We calculated cAMP concentrations using a 4-parameter logistic (4PL) curve fitting program (Prism version 8, GraphPad Software). We normalized interpolated cAMP values using total protein concentrations determined by a BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific Pierce Cat# PI23228).
To measure cAMP in zebrafish embryos stably expressing bPAC, we stimulated embryos from 24-28hpf with pulsed blue light or 10 μM forskolin in the presence of 100 μM IBMX (Millipore Sigma) diluted in egg water. For embryos injected with mRNA encoding either Cilia-bPAC (ARL13B-bPAC) or Nonciliary-bPAC (ARL13B V359A -bPAC), we shined pulsed (500ms on, 500ms off) 0.35mW/cm 2 470nm blue light in the presence of 100 μM IBMX from 14-18hpf. Injected embryos were lysed at 18hpf. After light stimulation, we dechorionated and lysed embryos in 0.1M HCl (Enzo). We lysed control embryos raised in the dark in batches of 10 embryos and calculated the average concentration per embryo. Transgenic embryos stably expressing bPAC were lysed individually. Injected embryos were lysed in pairs at 18hpf and the average concentration of cAMP per embryo reported. ELISA was performed as described above using 100 μL undiluted embryo lysate without the optional acetylation protocol. cAMP concentration was determined utilizing a 4-parameter logistic (4PL) curve fitting program (Prism version 8, GraphPad software).
Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (150nm NaCl, 50mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% NP-40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche). Protein concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Zebrafish embryos were deyolked before lysis in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, as previously described ( Link et al., 2006 62. Link, V. ∙ Shevchenko, A. ∙ Heisenberg, C.P. Proteomics of early zebrafish embryos BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6 :1 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). All lysates were boiled for 5 minutes in 4x SDS-PAGE loading buffer, except prior to immunoblotting for DREADD expression, for which lysates were incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes. Protein samples were separated on 4%–15% gradient TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). 5% non-fat dried milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween was used to block membranes and to dilute antibodies. HRP signal was detected using Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies used were goat anti-GFP (1:1,000, Rockland, RRID: AB_218182 ), mouse anti-GAPDH (1:100,000, Proteintech, RRID: AB_2107436 ), goat anti-GLI3 (1:200, R&D Systems, Cat #AF3690), goat anti-c-Myc (1:5,000, Novus, RRID: AB_10004121 ) and mouse anti-β-actin (1:100,000, Proteintech, RRID: AB_2687938 ). We used HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:5,000 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc).
In situ probes for n kx2.2b and o lig2 were gifts from Peng Huang. The plasmid for n kx2.2b was digested with Bam HI and in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. The plasmid for o lig2 was digested with Bgl II and in vitro transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase. Probes were purified using lithium chloride and ethanol precipitation. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed on 24hpf embryos fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in methanol at −20°C. Hybridization with dioxigenin (DIG) (Roche)-labeled riboprobes was performed following standard procedures, as described previously ( Reiter et al., 1999 84. Reiter, J.F. ∙ Alexander, J. ∙ Rodaway, A. ... Gata5 is required for the development of the heart and endoderm in zebrafish Genes Dev. 1999; 13 :2983-2995 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, embryos were rehydrated into PBST (0.1% Tween-20), digested with 10 μg/mL proteinase K (Roche) for 10 minutes and re-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by thorough washing. Embryos were prehybridized in in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 500 μg/mL yeast tRNA, 50 μg/mL heparin, 0.1% Tween-20, 9mM citric acid) for at least 1 hour at 68°C, followed by hybridization overnight at 68°C. Embryos were blocked for 2 hours (PBST, 2mg/mL BSA, 5% sheep serum), then incubated with anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments (Roche) diluted in block overnight at 4°C. The next day, embryos were washed extensively in PBST/BSA, equilibrated in fresh NTMT buffer (0.1M Tris, pH 9.5, 0.1M NaCl, 0.05M MgCl 2 , 0.1% Tween-20), then stained with NBT and BCIP (Roche) diluted in NTMT buffer. Embryos were mounted in 70% glycerol. Transverse sections and wholemount embryos were imaged using a Zeiss Observer D1 microscope equipped with an Axiocam MRc camera.
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1x10 5 cells per well. 24h after seeding, cells were starved in Opti-MEM reduced serum media overnight to promote ciliation. Cells were incubated with indicated drugs diluted in Opti-MEM for 5 hours. RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was used to make cDNA using the iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed in technical quadruplicates on a 384-well plate (USA Scientific, Cat# 1438-4700) using PowerUp SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems) and run on a QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method normalized to HPRT and RLPL0 expression. Data were normalized to measurements of wild-type cells treated with DMSO.
A frame-by-frame Monte Carlo simulation was performed for the diffusion of cAMP molecules in cells. The cell-cilium system was modeled as a ball-shaped cell body (radius R = 5 μm) connected with a cylindrical-shaped cilium (length L = 5 μm, diameter Φ = 300 nm) through a smooth junction at the ciliary base.
cAMP molecules were introduced at random locations at either the ciliary membrane or the plasma membrane at a constant rate of 34 molecules per second ( Figures 5 A and S5 A–S5D) or 340 molecules per second ( Figures S5 E and S5F) to simulate ciliary and plasma membrane cAMP generation, respectively. The cAMP molecules underwent random walks in the cell ( Berg, 1993 12. Berg, H.C. Random Walks in Biology: New and Expanded Edition Princeton University Press, 1993 Google Scholar ). For each step of random walk, the probability distribution function for a cAMP initially located at position ( x 0 , y 0 , z 0 ) in a frame to be found at position ( x , y , z ) in the next frame after time Δ t takes the form of 3D-Gaussian distribution: 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧 , Δ ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ | 𝑥 0 , 𝑦 0 , 𝑧 0 ) = 1 ( √ 2 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝜎 ) 3 ⁢ e x p ⁡ ( − ( 𝑥 − 𝑥 0 ) 2 + ( 𝑦 − 𝑦 0 ) 2 + ( 𝑧 − 𝑧 0 ) 2 2 ⁢ 𝜎 2 ) (1) Here, σ is the standard deviation of each step, and is related to the diffusion coefficient ( D ) and the time interval between two frames (Δ t ) by 𝐷 = 𝜎 2 / 2 ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝑡 (2) In our simulation, we used σ = 100 nm. This value was specified to be smaller than the smallest dimension of the cell (diameter of cilium Φ = 300 nm), yet not exceedingly small to allow for reasonable computation speed. An assumed diffusion coefficient D = 10 μm 2 /s therefore corresponded to Δ t = 0.5 ms. We considered elastic collisions between the cAMP and the cell membrane so that the cAMPs appeared at their mirrored positions with respect to the cell membrane in cases where cAMP trajectories would have exited the cell after the application of Equation (1) . We recorded the PKA interaction locations ( x c , y c , z c ) for the further analysis of the PKA activation.
The PKA molecules were modeled to be evenly distributed on the ciliary and the plasma membranes at the same surface density, ρ = 1 PKA / (140nm) 2 . Each PKA holoenzyme was activated by encountering 4 cAMP molecules. To simulate binding, we modeled PKA molecules to have a radius of r PKA = 2.5 nm, and one binding event was counted when a cAMP molecule collided with the adjacent membrane within r PKA of the PKA center ( x PKA , y PKA , z PKA ): ( 𝑥 c − 𝑥 P K A ) 2 + ( 𝑦 c − 𝑦 P K A ) 2 + ( 𝑧 c − 𝑧 P K A ) 2 < 𝑟 2 P K A (3) A PKA molecule was considered activated after 4 such binding events.
For all cell culture experiments shown, sample size (n) indicates the number of independent experiments. In all data panels, representative data from 3-5 independent experiments are shown. For zebrafish experiments, all sample sizes (n) are indicated for the number of embryos used in each experiment. To calculate the number of En-expressing, mCherry-expressing or Prox1-expressing cells per somite, images were converted to binary images using the threshold function and a minimum/maximum size exclusion filter was applied in Fiji. Cells were counted using the 3D objects counter function in Fiji. Cells in somites 12 through 15 were counted and an average value of cells per somite was determined for each embryo. The average values per embryo were used as individual data points in graphs and statistical analyses.
For fluorescence intensity measurements, a sum projection containing 10 slices was generated. Raw integrated density was measured in Fiji for a region of interest. For quantification of ciliary enrichment and quantification of SMO and GPR161 trafficking in cultured cells, a sum projection containing 10 optical sections was generated. A 5-pixel-wide segmented line was used to trace cilia, as defined by staining for TUB AC . For ciliary enrichment, raw integrated density was measured in Fiji and calculated as the ratio of signal at the cilium to the average of two cell body measurements. For quantification of ciliary SMO and GPR161 fluorescence, the average of two background fluorescence measurements adjacent to the cilium was subtracted from ciliary fluorescence. A negative value indicates background fluorescence was greater than ciliary fluorescence. Fluorescence was normalized to the mean of wild-type cells treated with vehicle in the dark.
For quantification of ciliary cAMP levels, a 5-pixel-wide segmented line was used to trace cilia at each time point. The ratio of ciliary Pink Flamindo to mIFP raw integrated density was measured for each time point using Fiji software. Relative intensity change was calculated using the fluorescence intensity ratio F/F 0 . Quantification of cytoplasmic Pink Flamindo fluorescence was performed on unprocessed TIFF images using a previously described MATLAB code ( Jullié et al., 2020 51. Jullié, D. ∙ Stoeber, M. ∙ Sibarita, J.B. ... A Discrete Presynaptic Vesicle Cycle for Neuromodulator Receptors Neuron. 2020; 105 :663-677.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Pink Flamindo fluorescence intensity was measured after thresholding and background fluorescence subtraction. Data are represented as the ratio of Pink Flamindo F/F 0, where F 0 is the Pink Flamindo fluorescence before stimulation. Average measurements for > 20 cells over three independent experiments are reported.
Quantification of GLI3 R was performed in Fiji. In brief, Mean Grey Value was measured for each band using a defined region of interest and an adjacent background value was subtracted. This resulting value for this GLI3 R band was normalized to the loading control (GAPDH). All values were normalized to wild-type cells treated with vehicle and no light.
For statistical analyses of two samples, significance was determined via two-tailed unpaired t test. For more than two samples, significance was determined via one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test for one variable or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test for two variables. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant and is denoted as follows: ∗ < 0.05, ∗∗ < 0.01, ∗∗∗ < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗ < 0.0001.
