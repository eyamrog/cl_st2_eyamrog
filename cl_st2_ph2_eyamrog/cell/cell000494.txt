Title: RTN4/NoGo-receptor binding to BAI adhesion-GPCRs regulates neuronal development


Abstract: Summary

RTN4-binding proteins were widely studied as “NoGo” receptors, but their physiological interactors and roles remain elusive. Similarly, BAI adhesion-GPCRs were associated with numerous activities, but their ligands and functions remain unclear. Using unbiased approaches, we observed an unexpected convergence: RTN4 receptors are high-affinity ligands for BAI adhesion-GPCRs. A single thrombospondin type 1-repeat (TSR) domain of BAIs binds to the leucine-rich repeat domain of all three RTN4-receptor isoforms with nanomolar affinity. In the 1.65 Å crystal structure of the BAI1/RTN4-receptor complex, C-mannosylation of tryptophan and O-fucosylation of threonine in the BAI TSR-domains creates a RTN4-receptor/BAI interface shaped by unusual glycoconjugates that enables high-affinity interactions. In human neurons, RTN4 receptors regulate dendritic arborization, axonal elongation, and synapse formation by differential binding to glial versus neuronal BAIs, thereby controlling neural network activity. Thus, BAI binding to RTN4/NoGo receptors represents a receptor-ligand axis that, enabled by rare post-translational modifications, controls development of synaptic circuits.

Section: Introduction

Adhesion-GPCRs constitute a large GPCR subfamily of mostly orphan receptors with poorly understood signal transduction mechanisms ( Paavola and Hall, 2012 54. Paavola, K.J. ∙ Hall, R.A. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors: signaling, pharmacology, and mechanisms of activation Mol. Pharmacol. 2012; 82 :777-783 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Adhesion-GPCRs have a long extracellular sequence, comprising domains implicated in cell adhesion and a GPCR autoproteolysis inducing (GAIN) domain ( Araç et al., 2012 2.

Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitors (BAIs) are adhesion-GPCRs whose extracellular sequences are composed of an N-terminal domain, 4 to 5 thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs), a hormone-binding domain (HBD), and a GAIN domain ( Nishimori et al., 1997 53.

TSRs are often modified by two unusual glycosylation reactions of unknown function, O-fucosylation of serines or threonines, and C-mannosylation of tryptophans ( Hofsteenge et al., 2001 28.

However, doubts have emerged about some of these proposed functions, given that BAIs are almost exclusively expressed in brain ( Haitina et al., 2008 22.

Multiple lines of evidence implicate BAIs in synapse formation, with perhaps the best evidence for BAI3. Conditional deletion of BAI3 from Purkinje cells severely impaired climbing-fiber synapse formation ( Kakegawa et al., 2015 32. Kakegawa, W. ∙ Mitakidis, N. ∙ Miura, E. ...

The secreted protein C1QL1 and its receptor BAI3 control the synaptic connectivity of excitatory inputs converging on cerebellar Purkinje cells Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :820-832 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, conditional deletion of BAI3 from olfactory bulb granule cells similarly suppressed the synaptic inputs from the anterior olfactory nucleus ( Wang et al., 2020 82. Wang, C.Y. ∙ Liu, Z. ∙ Ng, Y.H. ... A synaptic circuit required for acquisition but not recall of social transmission of food preference Neuron. 2020; 107 :144-157.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, BAI1 is enriched in postsynaptic densities ( Stephenson et al., 2013 69. Stephenson, J.R. ∙ Paavola, K.J. ∙ Schaefer, S.A. ... Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 signaling, regulation, and enrichment in the postsynaptic density J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :22248-22256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ), and BAI1 knockout (KO) mice exhibit major impairments in synaptic plasticity and spatial learning that are associated with structural changes in synapses ( Zhu et al., 2015 91. Zhu, D. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Swanson, A.M. ... BAI1 regulates spatial learning and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :1497-1508 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown experiments suggested that neuronal BAI1 inhibits dendritogenesis ( Duman et al., 2019 18. Duman, J.G. ∙ Mulherkar, S. ∙ Tu, Y.-K. ... The adhesion-GPCR BAI1 shapes dendritic arbors via Bcr-mediated RhoA activation causing late growth arrest eLife. 2019; 8 :e47566 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) but promotes spinogenesis and synaptogenesis by binding to the extracellular domain of neuroligin-1 ( Tu et al., 2018 73. Tu, Y.-K. ∙ Duman, J.G. ∙ Tolias, K.F. The Adhesion-GPCR BAI1 Promotes Excitatory Synaptogenesis by Coordinating Bidirectional Trans-synaptic Signaling J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :8388-8406 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). BAI1 and BAI3 have been implicated in neurological diseases such as autism ( Michaelson et al., 2012 51.

Genomics. 2007; 17 :605-617 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). How BAIs function in brain, however, remains unclear. Apart from neuroligin 1 ( Tu et al., 2018 73. Tu, Y.-K. ∙ Duman, J.G. ∙ Tolias, K.F. The Adhesion-GPCR BAI1 Promotes Excitatory Synaptogenesis by Coordinating Bidirectional Trans-synaptic Signaling J. Neurosci. 2018; 38 :8388-8406 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), small secreted C1q-like (C1ql) proteins are known to bind to BAI3 and modulate synapse formation ( Bolliger et al., 2011 5. Bolliger, M.F. ∙ Martinelli, D.C. ∙ Südhof, T.C. The cell-adhesion G protein-coupled receptor BAI3 is a high-affinity receptor for C1q-like proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :2534-2539 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Reticulon-4 receptors (RTN4Rs) were initially described as neuronal NoGo receptors, which were proposed to suppress axonal growth induced by “NoGo” proteins displayed on the surface of oligodendrocytes ( Fournier et al., 2001 20. Fournier, A.E. ∙ GrandPre, T. ∙ Strittmatter, S.M.

Schwab, M.E. Functions of Nogo proteins and their receptors in the nervous system Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11 :799-811 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). A wide range of other growth-inhibitory myelin proteins have also been reported to be RTN4R ligands, including myelin-associated glycoprotein ( Domeniconi et al., 2002 16. Domeniconi, M. ∙ Cao, Z. ∙ Spencer, T. ... Myelin-associated glycoprotein interacts with the Nogo66 receptor to inhibit neurite outgrowth Neuron. 2002; 35 :283-290 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (513) PubMed Google Scholar ), oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) ( Wang et al., 2002b 80. Wang, K.C. ∙ Koprivica, V. ∙ Kim, J.A. ... Oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein is a Nogo receptor ligand that inhibits neurite outgrowth Nature. 2002; 417 :941-944 Crossref Scopus (842) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a large number of cis -interacting proteins (i.e., p75, LINGO-1, etc.) ( Mi et al., 2004 50. Mi, S. ∙ Lee, X. ∙ Shao, Z. ... LINGO-1 is a component of the Nogo-66 receptor/p75 signaling complex Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7 :221-228 Crossref Scopus (737) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2002a 79. Wang, K.C. ∙ Kim, J.A. ∙ Sivasankaran, R. ... P75 interacts with the Nogo receptor as a co-receptor for Nogo, MAG and OMgp Nature. 2002; 420 :74-78 Crossref Scopus (735) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, a large-scale CRISPR receptor-ligand interaction screen identified BAI1 as a ligand for RTN4Rs ( Chong et al., 2018 10. Chong, Z.-S. ∙ Ohnishi, S. ∙ Yusa, K. ... Pooled extracellular receptor-ligand interaction screening using CRISP activation Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :205 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple inconclusive clinical trials were based on the notion that, as NoGo receptors, RTN4Rs inhibit axon regeneration. Moreover, molecular or structural evidence for the binding of RTN4/NoGo or of other putative ligands to RTN4Rs/NoGo receptors has not been forthcoming, and their status as physiologically relevant ligands is questionable. Thus, the bona fide ligands and physiological functions for RTN4R/NoGo receptors remain to be determined.
Here, we screened for BAI ligand(s) and identified RTN4/NoGo-receptor family (RTN4R, RTN4RL1, and RTN4RL2) as high-affinity receptors for BAI1 and BAI3. A crystal structure of the RTN4R/BAI1 complex revealed a highly unusual interface, in which mannosylated tryptophan and fucosylated threonine residues in the BAI1 TSR domain form essential contacts. This finding is consistent with a large-scale CRISPR receptor-ligand interaction screen showing that the TSR domains of BAI1 bind to RTN4Rs ( Chong et al., 2018 10. Chong, Z.-S. ∙ Ohnishi, S. ∙ Yusa, K. ... Pooled extracellular receptor-ligand interaction screening using CRISP activation Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :205 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). RTN4Rs and BAIs interact in trans ; this interaction is physiologically relevant since deletions of RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 cause a significant reduction of network activity, a decrease in synaptic transmission, a dramatic loss of synapses, and an increase in axonal and dendritic arborization in human neurons. Notably, wild-type but not mutant RTN4RL2 incapable of binding to BAIs could rescue these phenotypes in RTN4RL2 knockout neurons. By deleting BAI1-3 in glia, we found that interactions of neuronal RTN4Rs with neuronal BAIs regulate synapse formation and dendritic arborization, whereas interactions of neuronal RTN4Rs with glial BAIs mediate axonal outgrowth. Taken together, our data establish a functionally important trans -interaction of BAI adhesion-GPCRs with RTN4/NoGo receptors that is essential for the development of synaptic circuits.

Section: Results

To identify potential ligands for BAIs, we took two approaches. We screened for membrane proteins that could form adhesion complexes with full-length BAIs in trans when they were expressed on separate cells ( Boucard et al., 2014 6. Boucard, A.A. ∙ Maxeiner, S. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :387-402 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A). As an alternative approach, we performed pull-down experiments with the extracellular domains (ECDs) of BAIs as baits and membrane proteins from mouse brain as preys, followed by mass spectrometry ( Figure 1 A). Both approaches identified RTN4Rs/NoGo receptors as BAI ligands. Using pull-downs with the recombinant biotinylated ECDs of BAI1 and BAI3, we observed RTN4R and RTN4RL1 as the top interactors, in addition to the previously characterized BAI3 ligand C1qls ( Tables S1–S3 ; Figures 1 B, S1 B, and S1C) ( Mellacheruvu et al., 2013 49. Mellacheruvu, D. ∙ Wright, Z. ∙ Couzens, A.L. ... The CRAPome: a contaminant repository for affinity purification-mass spectrometry data Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :730-736 Crossref Scopus (1108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, among multiple membrane proteins tested, only RTN4Rs formed trans -cellular adhesion complexes with BAIs ( Figure S1 A).
We validated these interactions with three types of binding measurements. First, we employed a cell-surface labeling assay ( Bolliger et al., 2011 5. Bolliger, M.F. ∙ Martinelli, D.C. ∙ Südhof, T.C. The cell-adhesion G protein-coupled receptor BAI3 is a high-affinity receptor for C1q-like proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :2534-2539 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the fluorescently labeled recombinant ECDs of BAI1 or BAI3. These assays showed that both RTN4R and RTN4RL1 exhibited robust binding to BAIs ( Figure S1 D).
Second, we performed quantitative cell-adhesion assays by incubating HEK293F cells co-expressing GFP and BAIs with cells co-expressing mCherry and interacting candidates. BAI1- and BAI3-expressing cells strongly and specifically aggregated with cells expressing RTN4Rs ( Figures 1 C and 1D). EGTA (5 mM) did not decrease BAI1 and BAI3 binding to RTN4Rs, indicating that the BAI/RTN4R interaction is Ca 2+ independent ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S1 G, and S1H). As a control, BAI-expressing cells did not aggregate with cells expressing other pull-down candidates, Delta and Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (Dner), and integral membrane protein 2B and 2C (Itm2b and Itm2c) ( Figures S1 E and S1F). We further tested whether previously known BAI3 ligand C1ql3 competes with RTN4R for binding to BAIs ( Bolliger et al., 2011 5. Bolliger, M.F. ∙ Martinelli, D.C. ∙ Südhof, T.C. The cell-adhesion G protein-coupled receptor BAI3 is a high-affinity receptor for C1q-like proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :2534-2539 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Application of C1ql3 (10 μM) did not impair the aggregation of BAI1- or BAI3-expressing with RTN4R-expressing cells ( Figures S2 B-S2D). Moreover, C1ql3 did not affect the BAI1-RTN4R complex examined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), suggesting that C1ql3 does not compete with RTN4R for BAI1 binding ( Figures S2 E-S2H).
Third, we purified recombinant proteins encompassing the ECDs of BAIs and RTN4Rs and measured the binding affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), revealing affinities in the low nanomolar range ( Figures 1 E–1G and S2 A). The BAI3-RTN4R interaction exhibited the highest affinity (K d = 1.9 nM), while the BAI1-RTN4RL2 interaction displayed the lowest affinity that was still nanomolar (K d = 30.0 nM, Figure 1 G). In contrast, we failed to observe binding between the ECDs of BAI1 and all Neuroligin-1 splice variants ( Figures S2 I and S2J). High-affinity binding between the recombinant ECDs of BAIs and RTN4Rs strongly suggests a physiological interaction.
To identify RTN4R-binding domain, we generated a series of domain truncations of BAI1 and BAI3 ( Figure 2 A). Using cell-adhesion assays, we found that BAI1 and BAI3 fragments comprising the whole ECD, the N-terminal domains including the TSRs, or only the TSRs robustly bound to all three RTN4Rs, whereas fragments comprising only the hormone-binding and GAIN domain did not ( Figures 2 B, 2C, S3 A, and S3B). The single TSR3 domain of BAI1 ( Figures 2 B and 2C) and the single TSR2 domain of BAI3 ( Figures S3 A and S3B) bound avidly to RTN4Rs (note that BAI1 has an extra N-terminal TSR domain—thus, the TSR3 domain of BAI1 is equivalent to the TSR2 domain of BAI3). Next, we purified the ECDs of RTN4Rs and the various extracellular domains of BAIs as recombinant proteins. BAI1 N-terminal domains, including the TSR domains, formed a stable complex with the ECDs of RTN4R and RTN4RL1 as analyzed by SEC ( Figures 2 D, 2E, S3 C, and S3D), as did the single TSR3 domain of BAI1 and the single TSR2 domain of BAI3 ( Figures S3 E, S3F, S3I, and S3J). In accord with the aggregation assays, however, the single TSR2 domain of BAI2 did not form a complex with the RTN4R ECD ( Figures S3 G and S3H).
We crystallized the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of mouse RTN4R (27–310 aa) in a complex with the mouse BAI1 TSR3 domain and determined the complex structure at 1.65 Å resolution ( Table S4 ). In the complex, the BAI1 TSR3 domain binds to the C-terminal part of the concave face of the RTN4R LRR domain, as is commonly seen for LRR domain-ligand complexes ( Figures 3 A and 3B) ( Kobe and Kajava, 2001 35. Kobe, B. ∙ Kajava, A.V. The leucine-rich repeat as a protein recognition motif Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11 :725-732 Crossref Scopus (1352) PubMed Google Scholar ). The BAI1 TSR3 domain forms an elongated fold composed of a three-stranded anti-parallel β sheet ( Song et al., 2012 68. Song, G. ∙ Koksal, A.C. ∙ Lu, C. ...

Cell Biol. 2002; 159 :373-382 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 B). We observed a well-defined electron density for an O-linked glucose-β-1,3-fucose modification on Thr424, which forms water-mediated intramolecular hydrogen bonds that restrict the flexibility of this sugar modification ( Figure 3 C). This TSR domain glycosylation is known to be catalyzed by protein fucosyltransferase POFUT2 ( Chen et al., 2012 8. Chen, C.I. ∙ Keusch, J.J. ∙ Klein, D. ...

We also found that two of the Trp residues (Trp418 and Trp415), which are in an extended ladder of cation-π stacking interactions, contain intramolecularly stabilized mannosyl modifications, resembling previously reported TSR domain structures and unliganded BAI1 TSR3 domain structures ( Figures 3 D, 3E, and S4 ; Table S4 ) ( van den Bos et al., 2019 75. van den Bos, R.M. ∙ Pearce, N.M. ∙ Granneman, J. ... Insights into enhanced complement activation by structures of properdin and its complex with the C-Terminal domain of C3b Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :2097 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). RTN4R adopts a rigid toroidal overall topology commonly formed by LRR proteins ( Figure S4 D) ( Kobe and Kajava, 2001 35. Kobe, B. ∙ Kajava, A.V. The leucine-rich repeat as a protein recognition motif Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11 :725-732 Crossref Scopus (1352) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RTN4R/BAI interface contact residues are highly conserved among mouse and human homologs, suggesting a common recognition mode ( Figures 3 F and 3G).
In the BAI1 TSR3-RTN4R interface, the O4 and O5 hydroxyl groups of the fucosyl modification on Thr424 of TSR3 form direct hydrogen bonds with the sidechain of His210 of RTN4R ( Figure 4 A). Previously, a direct involvement of O-fucosylation in protein-protein contacts was observed for interactions of Notch, which is O-fucosylated by POFUT1, a fucosyl-transferase distinct from POFUT2 ( Luca et al., 2015 41. Luca, V.C. ∙ Jude, K.M. ∙ Pierce, N.W. ... Structural biology. Structural basis for Notch1 engagement of Delta-like 4 Science. 2015; 347 :847-853 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 42. Luca, V.C. ∙ Kim, B.C. ∙ Ge, C. ... Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity Science. 2017; 355 :1320-1324 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). The present observation provides structural evidence for a role of the POFUT2 catalyzed O-fucosyl modification in modulating ligand-receptor interactions, whose function was enigmatic. The mannosyl O6 hydroxyl on Trp418 of TSR3 also forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr254 of RTN4R ( Figure 4 A). In addition, a chloride ion observed in the interface engages in electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with Tyr232 and Arg256 on RTN4R and Arg430 on BAI1, respectively ( Figure 4 A).
Sequence alignments of BAI1 TSR3 domain with the corresponding TSR2 domains of BAI2 and BAI3 showed that the glycosylated, cation-π stacking and key contact residues observed in the RTN4R-BAI1 complex structure are conserved in mouse and human BAIs ( Figures 4 B and 4C). These results indicate that the specific BAI1-RTN4R binding mode is representative for other BAI/RTN4R interactions. Surprisingly, BAI2 does not interact with RTN4Rs despite high overall sequence identity and proper glycosylation ( Figure S3 K). This lack of binding is likely due to slight differences of the BAI2 TSR2 domain. Indeed, converting four residues at the C terminus of BAI1 TSR3 domain to corresponding BAI2 sequence abolished RTN4R binding ( Figure S4 K). Moreover, alignment of all five TSR domains of mouse BAI1 shows that BAI1 TSR1, 2, 4, and 5 domains differ in glycosylation motifs and/or key interface residues ( Figure S4 M). For example, BAI1 TSR3 domain contains an arginine at a central position (R430) whose mutation abolishes binding of BAI1 to RTN4R, explaining why the TSR1, 2, 4, and 5 domains do not bind to RTN4R ( Figures S4 L and S4M).
To further interrogate the significance of key contact residues at BAI1/RTN4R interface, we mutated these residues and measured the binding affinity by SPR ( Figures 4 D, 4E, S4 N, and S4O). We first introduced mutations on interface residues, including Arg430Ala and Leu420Ala on BAI1 and His210Ala, Try254Ala, Arg256Ala, and Ser281Ala on RTN4R. We found that the RTN4R Ser281Ala mutation had little effect on binding, whereas all other mutations abolished complex formation ( Figures 4 D, 4E, S4 N, and S4O). Importantly, the Thr424Val mutation that blocks O-fucosylation of BAI1 also abolished binding ( Figure 4 D), highlighting the requirement of O-fucosylation for complex formation. The Trp418Phe mutation produced a partial decrease in RTN4R binding ( Figure 4 D). Consistently, the corresponding mutations of His210 and Tyr254 in RTN4R, which form hydrogen bonds to O-fucose and C-mannose, respectively, ablated complex formation ( Figure 4 E). To directly test whether POFUT2 is involved in BAI-RTN4R interaction, we expressed Flag-tagged BAI1 in wild-type (WT) or POFUT2 KO HEK293T cells ( Benz et al., 2016 3. Benz, B.A. ∙ Nandadasa, S. ∙ Takeuchi, M. ... Genetic and biochemical evidence that gastrulation defects in Pofut2 mutants result from defects in ADAMTS9 secretion Dev. Biol. 2016; 416 :111-122 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), and performed surface staining with biotinylated RTN4R protein. Knockout of POFUT2 completely abolished the interaction of RTN4R and BAI1 ( Figures 4 F and 4G), indicating that POFUT2-mediated O-fucosylation contributes to BAI-RTN4R interaction.

Yuzaki, M. The C1q complement family of synaptic organizers: not just complementary Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 45 :9-15 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore the physiological relevance of BAI-RTN4R interaction, we used human neurons trans-differentiated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by forced expression of Ngn2 ( Zhang et al., 2013 89. Zhang, Y. ∙ Pak, C. ∙ Han, Y. ... Rapid single-step induction of functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells Neuron. 2013; 78 :785-798 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (990) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) of these neurons revealed that RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2 are highly expressed, whereas RTN4R is barely detectable ( Figure S5 A). We thus generated constitutive loss-of-function mutants for RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 in ESCs using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, selecting two independent ESC clones for each gene to control for possible off-target effects ( Figures S5 B and S5C) ( Cong et al., 2013 11.

Genotyping followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed that the mutant lines harbored homozygous loss-of-function mutations on both alleles ( Figures S5 B and S5C). Possibly due to partial nonsense-mediated decay, the mutations decreased the mRNA levels of RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 ( Figure S5 D). Moreover, immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry of RTN4RL2 confirmed a loss of RTN4RL2 protein in human mutant neurons ( Figures S5 E and S5F; RTN4RL1 protein could not be tested owing to a lack of specific antibodies).
We then investigated whether RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2 mutations alter signaling in neural networks formed by human neurons ( Sun and Südhof, 2021 71. Sun, Z. ∙ Südhof, T.C. A simple Ca 2+ -imaging approach to neural network analyses in cultured neurons J. Neurosci. Methods. 2021; 349 :109041 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2013 89.

Rapid single-step induction of functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells Neuron. 2013; 78 :785-798 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (990) PubMed Google Scholar ). We infected neurons generated from parental wild-type and mutant ESCs with lentiviruses encoding the Ca 2+ -indicator GCaMP6M ( Chen et al., 2013 9. Chen, T.-W. ∙ Wardill, T.J. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity Nature. 2013; 499 :295-300 Crossref Scopus (4326) PubMed Google Scholar ), incubated the neurons in 4 mM CaCl 2 and 8 mM KCl to enhance neural network activity by increasing the neurotransmitter release probability, and monitored neural network activity by measuring Ca 2+ transients ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Video S1 ).

Imaging speed was scaled up to 15-fold faster.
Control neurons exhibited robust neural network activity. This activity was dramatically impaired by both the RTN4RL1 and the RTN4RL2 mutation ( Figure 5 C; Video S1 ). We measured two network parameters, the synchronicity and amplitudes of peak Ca 2+ transients. Compared to control neurons, RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 mutant neurons exhibited a 40%–80% decrease in synchronous peaks depending on the clone, and a 50%–70% decrease in peak amplitudes ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Despite some variability between clones, these impairments were consistently present in all clones, suggesting that loss of function of either RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 causes a large reproducible impairment in the formation of synaptically connected neural networks in human neurons.
BAIs have been implicated in synapse formation in multiple brain regions ( Kakegawa et al., 2015 32. Kakegawa, W. ∙ Mitakidis, N. ∙ Miura, E. ...

A synaptic circuit required for acquisition but not recall of social transmission of food preference Neuron. 2020; 107 :144-157.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that their interactions with RTN4Rs may support synapse formation, which would explain the impaired neural network activity in RTN4RL1- and RTN4RL2 mutant neurons. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunocytochemistry for synapsin. Both RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2 loss-of-function mutations consistently decreased the density (30%–40%) and size (20%–30%) of synapsin-positive synaptic puncta ( Figures 5 F–5H), indicating a loss of synapses. Moreover, we quantified the levels of synaptic proteins in RTN4RL1- and RTN4RL2 mutant neurons. We observed a robust decrease (∼40%–60%) in the abundance of multiple presynaptic proteins (synaptobrevin-2, synapsin-1, SNAP25, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin-1, CASK, and piccolo) and of postsynaptic GluA1 receptors ( Figures 5 I and 5J). In contrast, the levels of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD95 and Homer1 were unchanged ( Figures 5 I and 5J).
Viewed together, these results suggest that RTN4Rs are essential for synapse formation and neural network activity. To independently confirm this conclusion, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The amplitudes of Na + and K + currents and the properties of action potentials were not different between RTN4RL2 mutant and control neurons ( Figures S6 A–S6C), suggesting that the RTN4RL2 mutation does not affect non-synaptic electrical properties of human neurons. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), however, revealed robust differences in synaptic connectivity between control and RTN4RL2 mutant neurons ( Figures 6 A and 6B). The RTN4RL2 deletion decreased the mean EPSC amplitude ∼60% without changing the paired-pulse ratio ( Figures 6 A–6C and S6 D), validating the morphologically observed decrease in synapse density ( Figures 5 F–5H). Thus, RTN4RL2 is essential for synaptic transmission and synapse formation in human neurons.
Does the function of RTN4Rs observed in human neurons depend on their interaction with BAIs? To address this question, we performed rescue experiments in RTN4RL2 mutant human neurons with wild-type (WT) and R257A mutant RTN4RL2 that does not bind to BAIs ( Figures 4 E and 6 A–6E). In addition, we examined the effect of the rescue manipulations in control neurons to test whether they act in a dominant fashion ( Figures 6 A–6E).
Wild-type RTN4RL2 fully rescued the decreased EPSC amplitude of RTN4RL2 mutant neurons, whereas R257A mutant RTN4RL2 failed ( Figures 6 A–6C). Neither construct significantly altered the EPSCs of control neurons ( Figures 6 A–6C). To further examine whether WT but not R257A mutant RTN4RL2 rescues the synaptic phenotype of RTN4RL2 mutant neurons, we measured synapse densities. WT RTN4RL2 completely reversed the ∼50% decrease in synapse density and the ∼30% decrease in synapse size in RTN4RL2 mutant neurons, whereas R257A mutant RTN4RL2 was inactive ( Figures 6 D and 6E). WT RTN4RL2 also modestly increased (∼20%) the synapse density in control neurons, while R257A mutant RTN4RL2 had no effect ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Thus, binding of RTN4RL2 to BAIs is required for the function of RTN4RL2 in promoting excitatory synaptic transmission and synapse formation in human neurons.
In our routine protocol, human neurons are co-cultured with mouse glia ( Zhang et al., 2013 89. Zhang, Y. ∙ Pak, C. ∙ Han, Y. ... Rapid single-step induction of functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells Neuron. 2013; 78 :785-798 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (990) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that BAIs are robustly expressed in cultured glia and in neurons, whereas RTN4Rs are expressed only in neurons ( Figures S7 A and S7B; Zeisel et al., 2018 88. Zeisel, A. ∙ Hochgerner, H. ∙ Lönnerberg, P. ... Molecular architecture of the mouse nervous system Cell. 2018; 174 :999-1014.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1503) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the question whether interactions of neuronal RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2 with glial or with neuronal BAIs regulate synapse formation. To address this question, we co-cultured human neurons with BAI1-3-deficient glia from conditional triple KO mice (unpublished data; Kakegawa et al., 2015 32. Kakegawa, W. ∙ Mitakidis, N. ∙ Miura, E. ... Anterograde C1ql1 signaling is required in order to determine and maintain a single-winner climbing fiber in the mouse cerebellum Neuron. 2015; 85 :316-329 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) and examined whether RTN4RL1- or RTN4RL2 mutant human neurons still exhibited decreased synapse density and size in the absence of glial BAIs ( Figures 6 F and 6G). Deletion of BAIs in glia had no effect on synapse formation in human neurons and did not alter the phenotypes of decreased synapse density and size in RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 mutant neurons ( Figures 6 F and 6G). Thus, neuronal RTN4Rs likely mediate synapse formation in human neurons by interacting with neuronal BAIs, consistent with the localization of BAI1 and BAI3 in postsynaptic specializations ( Stephenson et al., 2013 69. Stephenson, J.R. ∙ Paavola, K.J. ∙ Schaefer, S.A. ... Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 signaling, regulation, and enrichment in the postsynaptic density J. Biol.

Anterograde C1ql1 signaling is required in order to determine and maintain a single-winner climbing fiber in the mouse cerebellum Neuron. 2015; 85 :316-329 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, we asked whether RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 loss-of-function mutations affect the morphological development of human neurons in addition to synapse formation. We sparsely transfected control, RTN4RL1 mutant, or RTN4RL2 mutant neurons with tdTomato at DIV18 and quantified axonal morphology 2 days later ( Patzke et al., 2016 57. Patzke, C. ∙ Acuna, C. ∙ Giam, L.R. ... Conditional deletion of L1CAM in human neurons impairs both axonal and dendritic arborization and action potential generation J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :499-515 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unexpectedly, loss of function of RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 greatly increased, instead of decreasing, the length and branch number of axons ( Figures 7 A and 7C). We next sparsely transfected the neurons at DIV40 and quantified dendritic arborization 2 days later. Again, we detected a large increase ( Figures 7 E and 7G) without a change in soma area ( Figure S7 G). In these experiments, the quantification of axonal arborization had to be performed in immature neurons at DIV20 because, at DIV42, axons are so densely packed that quantifications are difficult.
The finding that neuronal RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2 deletions increased axonal and dendritic arborization in human neurons was surprising because it suggested that RTN4Rs perform multiple functions in neuronal development and that they promote synapse formation but inhibit dendritic and axonal growth. Previous studies have shown that, in Ngn2-induced human neurons, dendritic arbors largely develop during the first 1–2 weeks of culture, while axonal elongation occurs afterward, and synapse formation takes place even later ( Chanda et al., 2019 7. Chanda, S. ∙ Ang, C.E. ∙ Lee, Q.Y. ... Direct reprogramming of human neurons identifies MARCKSL1 as a pathogenic mediator of valproic acid-induced teratogenicity Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 25 :103-119 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Patzke et al., 2016 57. Patzke, C. ∙ Acuna, C. ∙ Giam, L.R. ... Conditional deletion of L1CAM in human neurons impairs both axonal and dendritic arborization and action potential generation J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :499-515 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). If RTN4Rs do perform sequential roles in neuronal development, their localizations should correlate with these functions. To assess this possibility, we examined the localization of endogenous RTN4RL2, the only RTN4R isoform to which a specific antibody is available, at different stages of neuronal development. Consistent with a role in both dendritic and axonal arborization as well as synapse formation, RTN4RL2 was found to co-localize with MAP2-labeled dendrites during early development at DIV7 but shift to an exclusively axonal localization soon afterward ( Figures S6 E and S6F). In these localizations, RTN4RL2 was co-localized with L1CAM, which is also dendritic early in development and becomes exclusively axonal later ( Patzke et al., 2016 57. Patzke, C. ∙ Acuna, C. ∙ Giam, L.R. ... Conditional deletion of L1CAM in human neurons impairs both axonal and dendritic arborization and action potential generation J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :499-515 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). A small fraction of RTN4RL2 was co-localized with synaptic markers in mature human neurons ( Figure S6 I). The same localization pattern was observed for exogenously expressed RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2, confirming its general applicability ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Thus, RTN4Rs exhibit a developmentally dynamic localization that is consistent with regulatory roles in dendritic arborization, axonal elongation, and synapse formation.
Is the increased dendritic and axonal arborization in RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2 KO neurons due to a loss of the interactions between neuronal RTN4Rs and BAIs? If so, are neuronal or glial BAIs the binding partners for neuronal RTN4Rs in these functions? To address these questions, we again examined the effect of deleting glial BAIs on axonal outgrowth and dendritic arborization of co-cultured human neurons, as described above for synapse formation. Interestingly, deletion of BAIs from glia greatly increased axonal outgrowth in co-cultured human wild-type neurons and occluded the increased axonal outgrowth phenotypes in RTN4RL1- or RTN4RL2 mutant human neurons ( Figures 7 B, 7D, and S7 C–S7E). In contrast, deletion of BAIs from glia had no effect on the dendritic arborization of human wild-type neurons and did not change the enhanced dendritic outgrowth phenotypes of RTN4RL1- or RTN4RL2 mutant neurons ( Figures 7 F, 7H, S7C, S7D, and S7F). None of these manipulations altered the soma size of neurons ( Figures 7 F and S7 H).
Given that glial BAIs are required for normal axonal elongation of neurons but not for normal dendritic arborization, do RTN4Rs function in dendritic arborization by binding to BAIs, or do other mechanisms apply? To address this question, we performed rescue experiments. Importantly, WT but not R257A mutant RTN4RL2 reversed the increase in dendritic arborization induced by the RTN4RL2 deletion ( Figures 7 I and 7J). WT RTN4RL2 by itself modestly decreased dendrite lengths in WT neurons, whereas R257A mutant RTN4RL2 increased dendrite lengths ( Figures 7 I and 7J). These results suggest that RTN4RL2 controls dendritic arborization by binding to BAIs and that its levels are not saturating for the regulation of dendritic arborization in human neurons. Again, none of these manipulations changed the soma area of neurons, indicating that they do not cause a simple neuronal growth phenotype ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Viewed together, these data suggest that during development, neuronal RTN4Rs first suppress dendritic arborization by binding to neuronal BAIs, then inhibit axonal arborization by binding to glial BAIs, and finally promote synapse formation by binding to neuronal BAIs again.

Section: Discussion

While many synaptic surface proteins are known, the receptor-ligand pairings that mediate synaptic interactions and organize synaptic functions remain largely enigmatic. RTN4Rs represent an “orphan” receptor family expressed in the brain that has been highly controversial. In the early to mid-2000s, when RTN4Rs were identified as NoGo receptors, intense interest developed in their interactions with a wide array of putative trans - and cis -ligands that were claimed to play important roles in axon regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system. Far-reaching proposals of these proteins as prime therapeutic targets for repair of spinal cord injury emerged, leading to ongoing clinical trials. However, none of the putative cis - or trans -interacting ligands for RTN4/NoGo receptors were molecularly or structurally characterized as bona fide physiological interactions. On the other hand, adhesion-GPCRs represent the second largest GPCR family in the human genome, but most adhesion-GPCRs have no known ligands. Here, we uncovered an unexpected convergence between RTN4Rs and BAIs, de-orphanizing these receptors and revealing a functional receptor-ligand axis in neuronal development and synapse formation. Thereby, this finding clarifies the true binding partners and functions of RTN4/NoGo receptors.
Three putative trans -ligands for RTN4/NoGo receptors, NoGo-A (a.k.a. reticulon-4), myelin-associated glycoprotein, and OMgp ( Schwab, 2010 62. Schwab, M.E. Functions of Nogo proteins and their receptors in the nervous system Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11 :799-811 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), are myelin-associated proteins proposed to inhibit axonal regeneration. The assignation of NoGo-A as the principal inhibitory ligand of RTN4/NoGo receptors was puzzling, however, given that it resides in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Voeltz et al., 2006 78. Voeltz, G.K. ∙ Prinz, W.A. ∙ Shibata, Y. ... A class of membrane proteins shaping the tubular endoplasmic reticulum Cell. 2006; 124 :573-586 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (928) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, the discovery of these myelin-associated putative ligands catalyzed a flurry of research aiming for drugs that reverse neurite outgrowth inhibition, for example, in spinal cord repair following injury. As GPI-anchored cell-surface proteins, RTN4/NoGo receptors lack signaling domains and thus have been linked to cis -interacting co-receptors such as p75, LINGO-1, and Troy as possible signal transducers ( Mi et al., 2004 50.

Although a crystal structure of the RTN4/NoGo receptor ECD described a broad convex surface of the LRR domain that could be poised for cross-reactive ligand interactions ( He et al., 2003 26.

Furthermore, deletion or blocking of RTN4/NoGo receptors produced mixed results on spinal cord regeneration in rodents ( Yiu and He, 2006 85. Yiu, G. ∙ He, Z. Glial inhibition of CNS axon regeneration Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7 :617-627 Crossref Scopus (1228) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2005 90. Zheng, B. ∙ Atwal, J. ∙ Ho, C. ...

USA. 2005; 102 :1205-1210 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the role of RTN4/NoGo receptors and their putative ligands in neurite outgrowth inhibition has proved to be far more puzzling than originally thought.
Our data allow three major conclusions. First, we discovered that BAI1 and BAI3 adhesion-GPCRs form trans -complexes with all three RTN4Rs (RTN4R, RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2) ( Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ). We showed that, in contrast to BAI1 and BAI3, BAI2 does not bind to RTN4Rs because it contains subtle evolutionarily conserved sequence differences proximal to the binding interface ( Figures 4 B and S4 K). It is thus likely that BAI2 performs a different function by binding to distinct ligands. Previous studies showed that BAI3 is a receptor for C1ql proteins in promoting synapse formation ( Bolliger et al., 2011 5. Bolliger, M.F. ∙ Martinelli, D.C. ∙ Südhof, T.C. The cell-adhesion G protein-coupled receptor BAI3 is a high-affinity receptor for C1q-like proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :2534-2539 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kakegawa et al., 2015 32. Kakegawa, W. ∙ Mitakidis, N. ∙ Miura, E. ...

A synaptic circuit required for acquisition but not recall of social transmission of food preference Neuron. 2020; 107 :144-157.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). C1ql proteins appear to target the N-terminal domain of BAIs ( Kakegawa et al., 2015 32. Kakegawa, W. ∙ Mitakidis, N. ∙ Miura, E. ... Anterograde C1ql1 signaling is required in order to determine and maintain a single-winner climbing fiber in the mouse cerebellum Neuron. 2015; 85 :316-329 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas we show that RTN4Rs bind to a single TSR of BAIs, suggesting that both can bind simultaneously, as also indicated by the fact that C1ql3 does not interfere with the BAI/RTN4R interaction ( Figures S2 B–S2H). An important question for future studies is whether RTN4Rs and C1ql proteins work in tandem to regulate synaptic and other neuronal functions, and if so, how they do so.
Second, we found that post-translational glycan modifications of BAIs mediate their specific high-affinity binding to RTN4Rs: this is extremely rare for protein-protein interactions. O-fucosylation and C-mannosylation of the BAI1 TSR3 domain act to produce “surrogate amino acids” within the RTN4R binding interface. By demonstrating that O-fucosylation via a dedicated fucosyl transferase (POFUT2) is essential for the binding of BAIs to RTN4Rs ( Figures 4 F and 4G), we find that POFUT2-mediated O-fucosylation of TSRs enables specific ligand-receptor interactions, similar to the analogous modification of Notch by another fucosyl transferase, POFUT1 ( Schneider et al., 2017 61. Schneider, M. ∙ Al-Shareffi, E. ∙ Haltiwanger, R.S. Biological functions of fucose in mammals Glycobiology. 2017; 27 :601-618 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). In proteins, glycans exert various functions, including roles in protein folding, quality control, and secretion ( Moremen et al., 2012 52. Moremen, K.W. ∙ Tiemeyer, M. ∙ Nairn, A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: diversity, synthesis and function Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 :448-462 Crossref Scopus (1288) PubMed Google Scholar ; Varki, 2017 76. Varki, A. Biological roles of glycans Glycobiology. 2017; 27 :3-49 Crossref Scopus (1631) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a long-standing question in the field of glycobiology concerns the direct involvement of glycans in protein-protein contacts. Receptor complexes in which O-fucosylation mediates protein-protein contacts are extremely rare, and all known cases involve POFUT1-mediated modifications of EGF-like repeats ( Luca et al., 2015 41. Luca, V.C. ∙ Jude, K.M. ∙ Pierce, N.W. ... Structural biology. Structural basis for Notch1 engagement of Delta-like 4 Science. 2015; 347 :847-853 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 42. Luca, V.C. ∙ Kim, B.C. ∙ Ge, C. ... Notch-Jagged complex structure implicates a catch bond in tuning ligand sensitivity Science. 2017; 355 :1320-1324 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). The present structure reveals a protein contact surface that simultaneously contains both O-fucosylation and C-mannosylation, thereby assigning a function to an enigmatic protein modification. Furthermore, in contrast to highly complex glycan modifications with different branching and anomeric configurations, BAI1 O- and C-glycosylations are homogeneous. Therefore, such homogeneous modifications can be directly encoded in the genome sequence, similar to an amino acid sequence.
Third, we observed that RTN4Rs perform multiple, likely sequential, functions in neuronal development, which are dependent on the BAI/RTN4R interactions. Using human neurons, we showed that loss-of-function mutations of RTN4RL1 or RTN4RL2 severely impaired firing of neurons in synaptic networks ( Figures 5 A–5E) and suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission ( Figures 6 A–6C). These synaptic impairments were associated with an increase in axonal and dendritic arborization ( Figures 7 A, 7C, 7E, and 7G) but a decrease in synapse density and in the levels of presynaptic proteins ( Figures 5 F–5J). Given that, in culture, human neurons first elaborate dendrites, then extend axons, and finally form synapses, these findings suggest that neuronal RTN4Rs sequentially regulate dendritic arborization, axonal elongation, and synapse formation. This conclusion is supported by the developmentally dynamic localization of RTN4RL2, which is dendritic early in development but exclusively axonal later ( Figures S6 E–S6I). Notably, interactions of neuronal RTN4Rs with glial BAIs are essential for regulating axonal elongation, while interactions of neuronal RTN4Rs with neuronal BAIs are necessary for controlling dendritic arborization and synapse formation ( Figures 6 F, 6G, 7 B, 7D, 7F, 7H, and S7 C–S7F).
In summary, our data suggest that RTN4Rs perform multiple functions in neurons, namely, to promote synapse formation and to restrict axonal and dendritic arborizations, and that they exert these functions through trans -cellular interactions of neuronal RTN4Rs with either neuronal or glial BAIs. These interactions involve an unexpected atomic mechanism that requires a highly specific set of glycan modifications of the BAI domains that have not previously been observed in ligand-receptor interactions. Since TSRs with modifications similar to those we observed in BAIs and cell-surface proteins with LRR-domains similar to those of RTN4Rs are widely present in nature, it seems likely that the trans -cellular regulatory mechanisms observed here will broadly apply to other interactions as well.
As with most observations, our study has limitations. We assessed the physiological significance of BAI-RTN4R interaction using cultured human neurons, which may differ from neurons in an intact brain. Different types of neurons express distinct patterns of RTN4R and BAI isoforms, whereas we here studied a reduced system with a less diverse molecular composition. Thus, the conclusions we make may differentially apply to various types of neurons and their synaptic circuits. Moreover, the signaling mechanisms of RTN4Rs and of BAIs in neuronal development remain unknown. Do RTN4Rs activate BAIs in trans as GPCRs? Do BAIs in turn stimulate RTN4R-dependent signals in trans via an association of RTN4Rs with co-receptors? At present, no data are available to address these questions. Furthermore, our data do not reveal information about the possibly distinct roles of different BAI isoforms, nor do they exclude the possibility that BAIs and RTN4Rs perform additional functions in brain. All these questions are important, but would not be raised without the results we have acquired here, which represent the starting point for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal development.

RTN4Rs, BAI ECDs, BAI TSR domain(s), four splice variants of Neuroligin 1 ECD used in SPR, C1ql3 and Teneurin2 ECD were cloned into pEG BacMam vectors and expressed in Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 50 mL of Expi293F cells were grown to 3 × 10 6 cells/mL. 50 μg of DNA was transiently transfected to Expi293F cells using 135 μL GIBCOTM ExpiFectamine TM 293 Reagent. Enhancers were added 18 hours after transfection and cells were incubated for another 72 hours before harvesting. Proteins were purified by Ni 2+ -NTA affinity column chromatography followed by SEC using 1 × HBS (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl) buffer. For the site-specifically protein biotinylation, BirA biotin-protein ligase standard reaction kit (Avidity) was used. Successful biotinylation was confirmed by streptavidin shift assay. Basically, streptavidin (SA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was mixed with biotinylated protein, followed by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) comparison of SA-protein complex with biotinylated protein alone. Similarly, BAI1 and RTN4R protein mutant constructs were made using site-directed mutagenesis to the original WT construct. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described for the WT protein.
Whole brains from CD1 mice (older than P 21, 9-12 g) were homogenated in 40 mL soluble fraction lysis buffer (40.0 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 mM TCEP (Millipore-Sigma), 20.0 mM NaCl, 2.0 mM CaCl 2 , 2.0 mM MgCl 2 , 100 μL Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Millipore-Sigma), 2 μL Benzonase® Nuclease (Millipore-Sigma), 2 tablets of cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Millipore-Sigma) dissolved in 50 mL H 2 O), and centrifuged at 21000 g, 4°C for 30 min.

The supernatant was used as the membrane fraction of the brain lysate for pull-down assay.
100 μg biotinylated mBAI1 ECD or hBAI3 ECD was incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 magnetic beads, Invitrogen) on ice for at least 30 min to form tetramer. BAI tetramer or equal volume of 1 × HBS (no protein negative control) was incubated with 14 mL membrane fraction of the brain lysate overnight at 4°C with rotation. The mixtures were centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded.

The HEK293T cell aggregation assay was performed as previously described ( Boucard et al., 2014 6. Boucard, A.A. ∙ Maxeiner, S. ∙ Südhof, T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :387-402 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following alterations. On Day 1, HEK293T cells were split into 6-well plates to 30% confluency. On Day 2, cells were co-transfected with the expression vector of the protein of interest and either GFP or DsRed using calcium phosphate co-precipitation. On Day 3, cells were washed with DPBS (GIBCO) and 0.5 mM EGTA in DPBS was added for detachment. After adding 1,125 U of DNase I from bovine pancreas (Millipore-Sigma) and triturating with flame polished pasteur pipettes, 35 μl of GFP and 70 μl of DsRed transfected cells of the binding pair were added to an Eppendorf vial containing 450 μl complete DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) enriched with 10 mM of CaCl 2 , 10 mM MgCl 2 and 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 1,125 U DNase. The samples were incubated on a rotating wheel at 4°C. After incubating for 50 min to 90 min, samples were inversed into 24-well plates and imaged with A1Rsi confocal microscopy.
HEK293F cells were cultured in 30 mL baffled flask and split into 1x10 6 cells/mL before transfection (viability > 90%). In tube A, 30 μL FreeStyle MAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added into 0.5 mL OptiMem (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. In tube B, 30 μg total DNA (15 μg pCMV5-GFP or pCMV5-mCherry + 15 μg surface display plasmid) was added to 1 mL OptiMem. Tube A and tube B were then mixed by pipetting, incubated at room temperature for 25 min, and added to 30 mL cells. After 48 hours transfection, cells were filtered with cell stainer 70 μm (Fisher Scientific) to remove the aggregated cells. GFP co-transfected cells and mCherry co-transfected cells were mixed at 1:1 ratio in non-coated 12-well plates (Corning ®Costar® Not Treated Multiple Well Plates, # CLS3737-100EA), and incubated with shaking in incubator (125 rpm, 37°C) for 1 hour.

Transfected cells were washed twice with cold DMEM containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and incubated with tetramer overnight at 4°C. The next day, cells were washed twice with cold DMEM containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and fixed in 4% PFA/4% sucrose/PBS for 20 min on ice. After washing 3 times with PBS, cells in Figure S1 D were mounted on the microscope slides. For the experiment in Figures 4 F and 4G, cells were further incubated with Flag antibody, Alexa Fluor 555 (1:100 in 5% BSA/PBS, Thermo Fisher) for 1 hour at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, and mounted on the microscope slides.

BacMam virus was packaged in SF9 cells as described ( Dukkipati et al., 2008 17. Dukkipati, A. ∙ Park, H.H. ∙ Waghray, D. ... BacMam system for high-level expression of recombinant soluble and membrane glycoproteins for structural studies Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 62 :160-170 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). HEK293S GnTI − cells were grown to a density of 2 × 10 6 per mL and infected with BacMam virus in the presence of 5 mM sodium butyrate. HEK293S GnTI - cells were generously provided by provided by Prof. H.G. Khorana lab (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA). Cell cultures were harvested after 72 hours and BAI1(408-462aa)-3C-Fc-6 × His protein was purified by Ni 2+ -NTA affinity column chromatography. To cleave the Fc tag and His tag, protein was incubated with 3C protease (Homemade) at 4°C overnight, and subsequently reloaded to Ni 2+ -NTA affinity column. Fc-His tag was trapped by the Ni 2+ -NTA affinity column, and flow through fractions for BAI1(408-462aa) were collected.
Mouse BAI1(408-462aa) was treated with Endoglycosidase H (Homemade), followed by treatment using 1:100 (w/w) carboxypeptidase A (Millipore-Sigma) and carboxypeptidase B (Millipore-Sigma). Protein was further purified by SEC via a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 1 × HBS buffer. The protein was concentrated to 10 mg/mL using Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL Centrifugal Filters Units (Millipore Millipore-Sigma, # UFC500396) before crystallization trials. Two different space group datasets were collected. The P2 1 crystals grew after 5 days in 0.1 M acetate, pH 4.6, 2 M sodium formate. Crystal in the P4 2 22 space group grew after 3 days in 1 M succinic acid, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.0 and 1% PEG 2,000 MME.
BAI1(408-462aa) and RTN4R(27-310aa) were mixed at a 1.1:1.0 molar ratio. The protein complex was treated with Endoglycosidase H, 1:100 (w/w) carboxypeptidase A, and carboxypeptidase B. Complex was further purified by SEC via a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 1 × HBS buffer. Fractions corresponding to the BAI1-RTN4R complex were pooled together and concentrated to 12 mg/mL using Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL Centrifugal Filters Units (Millipore Millipore-Sigma, # UFC501096).

BAI1(Residues 408-462) structure was manually built into electron density map in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 19. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20222) PubMed Google Scholar ). This manually built structure model was further improved by multiple rounds of refinement in Phenix ( Afonine et al., 2012 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Echols, N. ... Towards automated crystallographic structure refinement with phenix.refine Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2012; 68 :352-367 Crossref Scopus (3996) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, unliganded BAI1(Residues 408-462) structure was solved by molecular replacement using the solved BAI1 structure as molecular replacement model, followed by manual building. The detailed crystallography data collection and structural refinement statistics are reported in Table S4 .
Biotinylated RTN4R ECDs were coupled on a SA sensor chip (GE Healthcare) at low density. An unrelated biotinylated protein was captured in the control flow cells at similar density. All SPR measurements are performed in HBS-P buffer (GE Healthcare). Increasing concentrations of BAI ECDs were flown over the SA sensor chip and RU changes were monitored by Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare). After each round of ligand binding, the chip surface was regenerated by 4 M MgCl 2 . To assess the binding between Neuroligin 1 and BAI, biotinylated Neuroligin 1 splice variants were coupled on a SA sensor chip at low density. Increasing concentrations of BAIs were flown over the sensor chip. Due to the lack of binding, no regeneration step was performed. The SPR raw data were analyzed by the Biacore T100 accompanying evaluation software and re-plotted using GraphPad Prism 8.
BAI2 and BAI3 cKO mice were previously described ( Kakegawa et al., 2015 32. Kakegawa, W. ∙ Mitakidis, N. ∙ Miura, E. ... Anterograde C1ql1 signaling is required in order to determine and maintain a single-winner climbing fiber in the mouse cerebellum Neuron. 2015; 85 :316-329 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). The BAI1 knockin and cKO mice were generated in Janelia Research Campus. Briefly, the coding region in exon 2 is flanked by an upstream loxp site and the downstream frt (remaining after FLP removal of neomycin cassette) and loxp sites. The original signal peptide was replaced by a hemagglutinin (HA) signal peptide, with a Flag tag and Halo tag inserted between the HA signal peptide and BAI1 chain ( Figure S7 C). BAI1-3 triple cKO mice were obtained by sequential crossings of BAI1, BAI2 and BAI3 single cKO mice. Genotyping primers are listed in Table S5 .
Mouse glial cells were cultured as previously described ( Huang et al., 2017 30. Huang, Y.A. ∙ Zhou, B. ∙ Wernig, M. ... ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 differentially stimulate APP transcription and Aβ secretion Cell. 2017; 168 :427-441 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ). At DIV 0, forebrains were dissected from P 0 or P1 mice, digested by papain (Worthington) for 20 mins at 37°C. Digested tissues were dissociated by harsh trituration to avoid neuronal growth. Cells were plated onto T75 flasks in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta). For the BAI1-3 knockout experiment, at DIV 3, equal amount of FUGW-NLS-GFP-Cre lentivirus was added to both CD1 WT and BAI1-3 cKO glial cells. Upon reaching confluence, glial cells were dissociated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fihser), replated at 1:3 split ratio to remove potential trace amounts of mouse neurons. After reaching confluence, glial cells were used for human neuron co-culture. For the qRT-PCR assays, BAI1 probe 3 set, BAI2 probe 3 set and BAI3 probe 1 set were used ( Table S5 ).
Human neurons were generated as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2013 89. Zhang, Y. ∙ Pak, C. ∙ Han, Y. ... Rapid single-step induction of functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells Neuron. 2013; 78 :785-798 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (990) PubMed Google Scholar ). At day −1, human ES cells were detached with accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies), centrifuged and resuspended in mTeSR1 (Stem Cell Technologies) containing 2 mM thiazovivin (Bio Vision). Resuspended cells were split at 1:18 ratio in mTeSR1 containing 2 mM thiazovivin, infected with lentivirus (Ngn2 or Ngn2-GFP, 10 7 IU/well and rtTA, 10 7 IU/well) and plated in Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated 6-well plates. For rescue experiments, lentivirus expressing EGFP, WT hRTN4RL2-P2A-EGFP or hRTN4RL2 R257A-P2A-EGFP was also added on DIV −1.
Human neurons co-cultured with mouse glial cells: at day 0, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing N2-supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Invitrogen), human BDNF (10 ng/ml, PeproTech), human NT-3 (10 ng/ml, PeproTech), mouse Laminin-1 (0.2 mg/ml, Invitrogen), and Doxycycline (2 mg/ml, Millipore-Sigma) to induce TetO gene expression. At day 1 and 2, puromycin (1 mg/ml) was added to the medium for selection. At day 3, the cells were detached with accutase and co-cultured with mouse glial cells in Matrigel-coated 24-well plates. The basic medium used was: Neurobasal-A medium containing B27 (GIBCO), Glutamax (Invitrogen), BDNF, NT3, Laminin-1 and Doxycycline (2 mg/ml, Millipore-Sigma). At day 5, 50% medium was replaced by the basic medium containing Ara-C (2 mM, Millipore-Sigma) to inhibit astrocyte proliferation. At day 7, 25% of the medium was exchanged by the basal medium containing 2 mM Ara-C. At day 9, 50% medium was replaced by the basic medium containing 2 mM Ara-C and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta). After day 9, 50% of the medium was replaced by the basic medium containing 2 mM Ara-C and 2.5% FBS every week. Human neurons with glial co-culture were assayed at indicated time points for morphology, immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, calcium imaging and electrophysiology recording.
Human neurons without mouse glial cell co-culture: at day 0, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM/F12 containing N2-supplement, NEAA and Doxycycline to induce TetO gene expression. At day 1 and 2, puromycin was added to the medium for selection. At day 3, the cells were detached with accutase, re-plated in Matrigel-coated 6-well plates (6 × 10 5 cells/well), and cultured in Neurobasal-A medium containing B27, Glutamax and 2 mM Ara-C. Every two days, 50% medium was replaced with the same culture medium until DIV 12. Samples were harvested for qRT-PCR assays for RTN4Rs, and for immunoblot detection of RTN4RL2 protein in control and RTN4RL2 knockout clones.
At DIV 0, Hippocampi were dissected from P 0 mice, digested by papain (Worthington) for 20 mins at 37°C, filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer, and plated on Matrigel (Corning) coated coverslips in 24-well plates. Plating media contained 5% FBS (Atlanta), B27 (GIBCO), 0.4% glucose (Millipore-Sigma), 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO) in MEM (GIBCO). At DIV 1, culture medium was changed to growth medium containing 5% FBS (Atlanta), B27 (GIBCO), 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO) in Neurobasal A (GIBCO). At DIV 3, half medium was changed by growth medium containing 4 μM Ara-C (Millipore-Sigma), and neurons were analyzed at DIV 14-16.
To determine the mRNA levels of genes of interest in cultured cells, quantitative RT-PCR measurements were performed on total RNA (isolated with PrepEase RNA Spin Kit, Affymetrix) using TaqMan probes with VeriQuest Probe One-Step qRT-PCR Master Mix (Affymetrix) and a QuanStudio3 Real-Time PCR Systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The TaqMan primer/probe sets were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The TaqMan primer/probe sets for this present study are listed in Table S5 .
Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed for each RTN4Rs and purchased from Synthego. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex was formed by mixing 20 μM recombinant Cas9 protein (Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V, IDT), 30 μM sgRNA and Nucleofector Solution (P3 primary cell 4D-Nucleofector X kit S, Lonza) in 25 μL volume for 10 minutes at room temperature. H1 stem cells were detached with accutase, centrifuged, resuspended in 1 mL mTeSR1 containing 2 mM thiazovivin. After measuring cell density, 4.5 × 10 5 cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 5 μL Nucleofector Solution, and gently mixed with the 25 μL previously formed RNP complex solution. The mixture was transferred to a Nucleocuvette strip (P3 primary cell 4D-Nucleofector X kit S, Lonza), and placed in a 4D-Nucleofector Core Unit (Lonza). After running the ESC H9 program for nucleofection, cells were transferred to pre-warmed medium (mTeSR1 and 2 mM thiazovivin), and further plated on Matrigel-coated 6-well plates.
After several days, half of the nucleofected cells were used for genomic DNA extraction (QuickExtract DNA extraction solution, Epicenter), PCR amplification with primers flanking the edited region (P1 and P2, Figures S5 B and S5C), gel electrophoresis, DNA purification (Macherey-nagel) and Sanger sequencing (P3 and P4, Figures S5 B and S5C) to analyze the overall editing efficiency (ICE analysis by Synthego). The other half cells were further split at 1:1000 ratio in Matrigel-coated 6-well plates in order to get single cell colony. If the editing efficiency by ICE analysis is high, the isolated single cell colonies were picked and separately expanded in Matrigel-coated 24-well plates. After 2-3 days, genomic DNA of each single colony was again extracted for Sanger sequencing to identify homozygous loss-of-function mutants. The sgRNA sequences for targeting RTN4RL1 and RTN4RL2 and amplifying/sequencing primer sequences were shown in Key Resources Table .
Ngn2, Ngn2-GFP and rtTA lentiviruses were produced by Janelia Farm Viral Core Facility, and each was used at a MOI of 1 × 10 7 IU/well for 6-well plate infection. GCaMP6M, FUGW-NLS-GFP-Cre, FUGW-EGFP, FUGW-hRTN4RL2-P2A-EGFP and FUGW-hRTN4RL2 R257A-P2A-EGFP lentivirus was produced as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2013 89.

Lentivirus expressing GCaMP6M was infected to stem cells together with Ngn2 and rtTA at DIV −1. Calcium imaging were performed at DIV 42-45. Experiments were performed at room temperature on a Nikon inverted epifluorescence microscope. For potentiating synaptic transmission of human neurons, the cells were imaged with ambient 4 mM CaCl 2 and 8 mM KCl equilibrated in a HEPES-based buffer (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 20 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 μM glycine) for 2-3 min. Images were analyzed by MATLAB, and movies were generated by Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012).
Glia-cocultured human neurons were sparsely transfected with tdTomato (Takara, CalPhos mammalian transfection kit) at around DIV 18 (axon tracing, 0.5 μg DNA per well in 24-well plates) and DIV 40 (dendrite arborization and soma size, 1.0 μg DNA per well in 24-well plates). After two days’ transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 4% sucrose and PBS for 20 min at 4°C. After three times wash with PBS, cells were blocked in PBS containing 2.5% goat serum (Millipore-Sigma), 2.5% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room temperature.

Samples were harvested in N-PER Neuronal Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with cocktail protease inhibitors, and prepared for standard SDS-PAGE. Samples were separated on 4%–20% precast protein gels (Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast gels, Bio-Rad), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot Turbo RTA midi nitrocellulose transfer kit, Bio-Rad) or 0.2 μm pore size PVDF membranes (wet transfer for GluA1 and Piccolo). Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS-T (Tris Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hour at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA in TBS-T. We used the following antibodies: TuJ1 (mouse, Covance MMS-435P), SNAP25 (mouse, SySy 71.1), Synaptobrevin-2 (rabbit, Jacqueline Manu P939), Synapsin (rabbit, Yenzyme 6078), Synaptophysin (rabbit, homemade P580), PSD95 (mouse, homemade L667), Homer1 b/c (rabbit, Yenzyme 6085), Synaptotagmin 1 (mouse, SySy 41.1), GluA1 (rabbit, Millipore, AB 1504), CASK (mouse, Neuromab K56A) and Piccolo (mouse, SySy). Membranes were washed 3 times for 5 minutes in TBS-T, followed by incubation with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody for 1 hours at room temperature (800CW and 680LT, LI-COR Biosciences, 1:10000 in TBS-T), and 3 times wash with TBS-T. Immunoblotting and quantitative analysis were performed by Odyssey Infrared Imager CLX and software Image Studio 5.2.5 (LI-COR Biosciences). Signals were normalized for TuJ1 probed on the same blots as loading controls.
Electrophysiological recordings were performed from glia co-cultured human neurons plated on coverslip, which were placed in a recording chamber mounted on a fixed stage inverted phase-contrast microscope (Olympus). Patch electrodes (3-5 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubes (Warner Instruments) using a PC-10 pipette puller (Narishige). Whole-cell capacitance and series resistances were recorded and compensated to > 80%, and in addition, series resistances were less than two times the tip resistance. The Tyrode’s bath solution contained (in mM): 129 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 0.01 glycine, 30 D-glucose and 25 HEPES, pH 7.2–7.4.
Action potential (AP) firing properties of human neurons were recorded in current-clamp mode using standard Tyrode bath solution supplemented with CNQX (20 μM), APV (50 μM) and PTX (50 μM) to block all excitatory (AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated) and inhibitory (GABAAR-mediated) synaptic inputs, respectively. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 110 K-gluconate, 40 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 Na 2 -ATP, 2 Mg-ATP and 0.3 GTP, pH 7.35 (adjusted with KOH) ( Wang et al., 2018 81. Wang, J.-Z. ∙ Long, C. ∙ Li, K.-Y. ... Potent block of potassium channels by MEK inhibitor U0126 in primary cultures and brain slices Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :8808 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). To elicit action potential, increasing amount of currents were injected (from −10 pA to +140 pA, with 10 pA increments) for 1 s in a stepwise manner. For intrinsic currents recording, at a holding potential of −60 mV, the Na + and K + currents were evoked by voltage steps (from −80 mV to +70 mV in 10 mV increments, 100 ms). Leakage and capacitive currents were digitally subtracted on-line with P4 protocol.
Action-potential evoked synaptic responses were recorded in voltage-clamp mode with a pipette solution containing (in mM): 135 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 2 Na 2 GTP, and 5 QX-314, pH 7.35 (adjusted with CsOH) ( Maximov et al., 2007 44. Maximov, A. ∙ Pang, Z.P. ∙ Tervo, D.G. ... Monitoring synaptic transmission in primary neuronal cultures using local extracellular stimulation J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 161 :75-87 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Presynaptic APs for evoked synaptic responses were triggered by 0.5-ms current (40-90 mA) injections through a local extracellular electrode (FHC concentric bipolar electrode, Catalogue number CBAEC75) placed ∼100 μm from the soma of neurons recorded. The frequency, duration, and magnitude of the extracellular stimulus were controlled with a Model 2100 Isolated Pulse Stimulator (A-M Systems, Inc.) synchronized with the Clampex 10.2 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices). To determine paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) of evoked synaptic responses, two sequential APs were elicited with a given time interval. Each paired stimulation intervals (20-500 ms) were repeated 3 times with an intertrial-interval of 30 s. Stimulation intensities were variable during these recordings to prevent the induction of excessive synaptic network activity following stimulations. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were pharmacologically isolated with PTX (50 μM) and recorded at a −70 mV holding potential. All Data were filter during acquisition with a low pass filter set at 2 kHz using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices) ( Chanda et al., 2019 7. Chanda, S. ∙ Ang, C.E. ∙ Lee, Q.Y. ...

Data analysis was performed offline with Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices).
Results are reported as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 8.
