Title: Structure of RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex at 2.9 Å defines initial DNA opening


Abstract: Summary

Transcription initiation requires assembly of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pre-initiation complex (PIC) and opening of promoter DNA. Here, we present the long-sought high-resolution structure of the yeast PIC and define the mechanism of initial DNA opening. We trap the PIC in an intermediate state that contains half a turn of open DNA located 30–35 base pairs downstream of the TATA box. The initially opened DNA region is flanked and stabilized by the polymerase “clamp head loop” and the TFIIF “charged region” that both contribute to promoter-initiated transcription. TFIIE facilitates initiation by buttressing the clamp head loop and by regulating the TFIIH translocase. The initial DNA bubble is then extended in the upstream direction, leading to the open promoter complex and enabling start-site scanning and RNA synthesis. This unique mechanism of DNA opening may permit more intricate regulation than in the Pol I and Pol III systems.

Section: Introduction

Over the last two decades, considerable efforts were made to unravel the structural basis of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The pre-initiation complex (PIC) structure was elucidated at medium resolution in the yeast ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ...

We trapped the yeast core PIC in three states, a closed promoter complex (CC) with DNA above the active center cleft ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50. Plaschka, C. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Dienemann, C. ... Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening Nature. 2016; 533 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), a CC with distorted DNA in the upper part of the cleft (CC dist ) ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9.

Despite these advances, it remains unknown where DNA opening begins and which structural elements are involved in opening. Also, only parts of the PIC were resolved at high resolution in the available yeast ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50. Plaschka, C. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Dienemann, C. ... Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening Nature. 2016; 533 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ) and human ( He et al., 2016 23. He, Y. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Fang, J. ... Near-atomic resolution visualization of human transcription promoter opening Nature. 2016; 533 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ) structures. In particular, TFIIE and TFIIH, which are critical for DNA opening, were resolved only at medium or low resolution, preventing mechanistic insights. Here, we arrive at the long-sought high-resolution structure of the yeast PIC and provide detailed views for four functional states of the PIC, including a previously unobserved intermediate state of DNA opening. Based on these structural data, we conduct a functional analysis that defines the initial step of DNA opening and reveals mechanistic features that are unique to the Pol II system.

Section: Results

To obtain a high-resolution view of the complete yeast PIC, we optimized sample preparation for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) ( STAR Methods ). We assembled the PIC and incubated it with ADP-BeF 3 , which mimics the transition state of ATP hydrolysis in Ssl2 and was predicted to reduce PIC flexibility and spontaneous DNA opening ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A; STAR Methods ). Rigorous 3D classification of a very large single-particle dataset ( Figures S1 B–S1E, S2 A, and S2B) identified a subset of complexes containing all PIC components. Focused refinement resolved 14 mobile modules in the PIC, leading to an atomic model of the PIC at a nominal resolution of 2.9 Å ( Figures 1 , S2 A, S3 , S4 A and S4B; Tables S1 and S2 ). Compared to the most detailed previous PIC model ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50. Plaschka, C. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Dienemann, C. ... Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening Nature. 2016; 533 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), our refined structure contains ∼450 additional amino acid residues and includes atomic models for TFIIE and TFIIH, which were previously resolved only at the backbone level ( Figure 2 ; Table S3 ). Further particle sub-classification revealed that the crescent-shaped TFIIH can adopt defined contracted and expanded conformations within the PIC ( Figures S2 A, S3 , S4 A, and S5 A–S5E; STAR Methods ).
The PIC structure resolves the majority of the DNA at nucleotide resolution and reveals many additional features of the PIC ( Figures 2 and S4 B). It also defines the two major interfaces between the core PIC and TFIIH in detail. One interface is formed between the Pol II stalk, TFIIE and the RING finger of TFIIH subunit Tfb3 (human MAT1), whereas the other one is formed between the Pol II clamp and the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of TFIIH subunit Tfb1 (human p62) ( Figures 3 and S6 A–S6C). The latter interface is stabilized by the TFIIE element “E-dock” (Tfa1 residues 195–222) ( Figures 3 and S6 B). The E-dock anchors the E-wing, a domain in TFIIE located near the upstream edge of the open DNA region ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50. Plaschka, C. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Dienemann, C. ... Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening Nature. 2016; 533 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structural model of Ssl2 was extended, defining its interactions with TFIIH subunits Tfb2, Tfb5, and the E-bridge helix ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) of TFIIE ( Figures 3 , S6 D, and S6F). We also observed a contact between Ssl2 and the Pol II jaw domain that involves the Ssl2 element “jaw binder” (residues 830–837) ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Another contact is formed between the Ssl2 ATPase lobe 2 and the “E-tether” in TFIIE (Tfa2 residues 309–327) ( Figures 3 , S6 D, S6E, and S6H), explaining biochemical data ( Lin and Gralla, 2005 35.

Biol. 2003; 23 :2914-2926 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We obtained structures of four discrete PIC states ( Video S1 ). We resolved the three known states, CC ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50. Plaschka, C. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Dienemann, C. ... Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening Nature. 2016; 533 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), CC dist ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ... Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :97-106.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), and OC ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ), at considerably higher resolution ( Figures S2 B, S3 , and S4 A; STAR Methods ). In addition, we observed a PIC state that reflects an intermediate complex (IC) between the CC dist and the OC ( Figure 4 A). In the IC state, the upstream DNA closely resembles that in CC dist , whereas downstream DNA is translocated in the upstream direction and rotated around its helical axis. As a consequence, half a turn of DNA is unwound in a region 30–35 base pairs (bp) downstream of the TATA box ( Figures 4 B and 4C). The weaker cryo-EM density in the DNA bubble region of the IC did not allow for unambiguous modeling at nucleotide resolution, but indicated that base-stacking interactions are likely retained along both DNA strands ( Figures 4 and S7 A), possibly lowering the energy barrier to strand separation. The observed small initial DNA bubble agrees well with published biochemical data. Permanganate footprinting experiments are consistent with our observation ( Giardina and Lis, 1993 16. Giardina, C. ∙ Lis, J.T. DNA melting on yeast RNA polymerase II promoters Science. 1993; 261 :759-762 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ) and showed in the mammalian system that a short single-stranded DNA region indeed formed ∼30 bp downstream of the TATA box, counting from the first T residue in TATA ( Holstege et al., 1996 24. Holstege, F.C. ∙ van der Vliet, P.C. ∙ Timmers, H.T.

Polymerase II promoter activation: closed complex formation and ATP-driven start site opening Science. 1992; 255 :450-453 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, the initial bubble size corresponds to that of a bubble identified in magnetic tweezer assays ( Tomko et al., 2017 67. Tomko, E.J. ∙ Fishburn, J. ∙ Hahn, S. ...

For details compare the text, Figures 1, S2, S3, and S4 and Table S2.
In the IC structure, TFIIH adopts an expanded conformation and the Ssl2 translocase adopts the post-translocated state, in contrast to the pre-translocated state observed in CC dist ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ... Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :97-106.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the absence of ADP-BeF 3 ( Figures S5 A, S5B, S5F, and S5G). These observations are consistent with a simple model for the initial step of DNA opening. Binding of ADP-BeF 3 would trigger a power stroke of the Ssl2 translocase that converts the PIC from the CC dist to the IC state. This stroke involves translocating and rotating downstream DNA by one base pair and opening half a turn of DNA in the Pol II cleft. DNA opening may be initiated at a kink in the DNA that is observed in CC dist ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ... Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :97-106.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may locally weaken the stability of the DNA duplex. To visualize this initial step of DNA opening, we prepared an animation that illustrates the changes in DNA and TFIIH conformation that accompany the CC dist -IC transition ( Video S2 ).

Promoter DNA opening within the PIC, related to Figure 7 Conformational morph between the CC dist state with Ssl2 in a pre-translocation conformation and closed, distorted DNA (model based on coordinates of PDB file 6GYM) (Dienemann et al., 2019), and the IC state with Ssl2 in a post-translocation conformation and an initial promoter DNA bubble (this study). Transition to the OC state demarcates the last stage of transcription pre-initiation directly prior to RNA synthesis. The template DNA path in the OC was derived from the model of transcribing Pol II (PDB accession code 5FLM). For details compare text and Figure 7.
In the IC, the initially opened DNA region forms several contacts with Pol II, TFIIE, and TFIIF ( Figures S7 B–S7G). These contacts may facilitate initial DNA opening and include a loop protruding from the Pol II domain “clamp head” (Rpb1 residues 187–196, called here the “clamp head loop”). This loop contacts the major groove of DNA in the initially opened DNA region ( Figures 5 A and S7 F). To test whether the clamp head loop is required for function, we prepared a yeast strain expressing a Pol II variant that lacks this loop (Rpb1 ΔCHL) and purified this variant ( Figure S8 C; STAR Methods ). We set up an in vitro promoter-dependent transcription assay ( STAR Methods ) using our highly purified recombinant proteins and a linear DNA template containing the GAT1 promoter, which does not open spontaneously ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ... Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :97-106.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The obtained yield in promoter-initiated transcription was very high and allowed us to directly visualize and quantify the electrophoretically separated RNA product ( Figures S8 A and S8B).
In this highly defined transcription system, the Pol II variant Rpb1 ΔCHL showed only approximately half the activity of wild-type Pol II, and this difference was independent of polymerase concentration ( Figures 5 B and S8 D). Thus, the clamp head loop is required for normal promoter-initiated transcription. To investigate whether this loop functions in initial DNA opening, we used DNA templates that contained 1, 2, or 5 DNA mismatches in the region observed to be opened in the IC. Increasing the number of mismatches in the DNA increased transcription activity in our assay, consistent with initial DNA opening occurring in this defined region and being rate-limiting for promoter-initiated transcription ( Figures 5 C, S8 E, and S8F). The DNA mismatches also largely reversed the decrease in transcription that was introduced by deletion of the clamp head loop ( Figure S8 G). These data indicate that the clamp head loop of Pol II stimulates initial DNA opening in the region that we delineated in the IC structure.
The initially opened DNA region is apparently further stabilized by the “charged region” in TFIIF (residues 401–432 in the large TFIIF subunit Tfg1) ( Mühlbacher et al., 2014 38. Mühlbacher, W. ∙ Sainsbury, S. ∙ Hemann, M. ... Conserved architecture of the core RNA polymerase II initiation complex Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4310 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TFIIF charged region is located opposite of the clamp head loop on the other side of the Pol II cleft. Published mutational analysis showed that the charged region stimulates initial RNA synthesis by Pol II ( Ren et al., 1999 51. Ren, D. ∙ Lei, L. ∙ Burton, Z.F. A region within the RAP74 subunit of human transcription factor IIF is critical for initiation but dispensable for complex assembly Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 :7377-7387 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our high-resolution structure shows that the TFIIF charged region forms two α helices and contacts the DNA along the minor groove with positively charged residues, of which two are highly conserved (K415 and K416 in yeast Tfg1, R166 and R167 in human TFIIFα) ( Figures 4 C, S7 D, and S7E). In summary, these results suggest that the Pol II clamp head loop and the TFIIF charged region function in promoter DNA melting by stabilizing the initially opened DNA region observed in our IC structure.
The high-resolution PIC structures also enabled us to investigate the regulation of DNA opening by TFIIE, which is known to recruit TFIIH. The C-terminal region of the large TFIIE subunit Tfa1 contains six structural elements that contact Pol II and TFIIH at various locations ( Figures 3 , S6 A, S6B, S6F, S9 A, and S9E). To test these TFIIE elements for functionality, we prepared eleven TFIIE variants with progressively longer truncations from the Tfa1 C terminus, and four TFIIE variants with residue substitutions, and analyzed their activity in promoter-initiated transcription ( Figures 6 A, S9 A, and S9B).
We found that removal of the entire C-terminal region of Tfa1 reduced transcription activity to ∼42% ( Figures 6 B, S9 C, and S9D, variant K). Critical for this defect were two TFIIE elements, the E-tip and the E-bridge, which contributed to similar extents ( Figures 6 B, S9 C, and S9D, variants M and N). The E-tip and the E-bridge buttress the Pol II clamp head loop and lobe 2 of the Ssl2 translocase, respectively, which are both elements that function in DNA opening. We also discovered an additional element in Tfa1, the “E-throttle,” which restricts transcription ( Figures 6 B, S9 C, and S9D, variants E–G, O), likely by influencing the adjacent E-bridge and Ssl2 lobe 2 mobility. This analysis showed that the C-terminal region of TFIIE functions in transcription not only indirectly, by recruiting TFIIH, but also directly, by regulating TFIIH-assisted DNA opening.

Section: Discussion

Here, we present complete atomic models of the yeast PIC in different functional states and conclude a long-term experimental and modeling effort. Together with previous findings, our results provide the structural basis of Pol II transcription initiation in yeast ( Figure 7 ). An important discovery is the observation of a stable intermediate of DNA opening, called the IC, which contains a small initial DNA bubble located ∼30 bp downstream of the TATA box. This observation indicates that the TFIIH translocase first opens half a turn of DNA, leading to the IC, before further DNA opening converts the IC to the OC. Such a two-step mechanism of DNA opening is likely conserved between the yeast and human Pol II systems because opening is known to commence in the same DNA region and the resulting OC states are highly similar. In contrast, the yeast and human systems differ in the subsequent definition of the transcription start site. Whereas yeast Pol II scans open DNA and uses transcription start sites (TSS) in a region 40–120 bp downstream of the TATA box, mammalian Pol II does not scan DNA and generally commences RNA synthesis in a narrow window around 30 bp downstream of the TATA box ( Carninci et al., 2006 5.

Our work further highlights that the mechanism of DNA opening defined here is unique to the Pol II system. It was long known that the Pol II system relies on an ATP-dependent translocase for DNA opening, whereas all other RNA polymerases open DNA with the use of binding energy alone. Here, we additionally show that DNA opening initiates downstream and progresses upstream in the Pol II system, whereas all other transcription systems open DNA in the opposite direction, as reported for Pol I ( Han et al., 2018 21.

In these alternative transcription systems, DNA is bound only upstream of the TSS, and therefore DNA opening can only start from upstream and progress downstream. In contrast, the Pol II PIC binds DNA both upstream and downstream of the TSS, and this enables DNA opening in the opposite direction, starting from downstream and progressing upstream. This mechanism may also prevent spontaneous opening from the upstream side ( Alekseev et al., 2017 4. Alekseev, S. ∙ Nagy, Z. ∙ Sandoz, J. ... Transcription without XPB Establishes a Unified Helicase-Independent Mechanism of Promoter Opening in Eukaryotic Gene Expression Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 :504-514.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Pol II initiation system also relies on the C-terminal region of the large TFIIE subunit, the Pol II clamp head, and the TFIIF charged region, none of which have counterparts in other systems. Further consistent with the inability of the Pol II system to open DNA from the upstream side, the TFIIE element E-wing contacts DNA at an upstream position where opening commences in other systems ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ... Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft Mol.

Plaschka, C. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Dienemann, C. ... Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening Nature. 2016; 533 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA opening is known to be a regulated step in gene transcription ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ...

Global regulation of promoter melting in naive lymphocytes Cell. 2013; 153 :988-999 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ), and therefore the unique mechanism of DNA opening defined here likely enables a more intricate regulation of Pol II transcription when compared to other transcription systems.
A very large cryo-EM dataset was collected for this study, but rigorous classification was required to separate the distinct DNA conformations. This resulted in a limitation of the number of particles representing each DNA state and hence lowered the resolution of the respective reconstructions. As a consequence, we could not resolve the region of the initial DNA bubble in the IC at nucleotide resolution ( Figure S7 A). Although we are convinced that our interpretation of the observed cryo-EM density is correct, our interpretation that base-stacking is retained within the initial bubble remains preliminary. Also, a lower number of particles with additional DNA conformations were present in the data and may represent intermediates between the IC and the OC that could not be structurally resolved at this stage ( Figure S2 B).

XL-1 Blue E.coli cells were used for plasmid transformation during generation of plasmids for TFIIE mutants and in vitro transcription scaffolds. Single colonies were picked and cultured in LB broth with appropriate antibiotics at 37°C at 150 rpm.
DH10EMBacY E.coli cells were used for plasmid transformation preceding bacmid preparation. Single colonies were picked and cultured in LB broth with appropriate antibiotics at 37°C at 150 rpm prior to bacmid isolation.
BL21CodonPlus (DE3) RIL E.coli cells were used for plasmid transformation in preparation of recombinant protein expression. Single colonies were picked and cultured in LB broth with appropriate antibiotics at 37°C overnight at 150 rpm. Two-liter flasks of LB broth with appropriate antibiotics were inoculated with overnight bacterial cultures in a 1:100 ratio and cells were grown at 37°C degrees at 150 rpm. Protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG (0.1 mM final concentration) at 0.6 OD600 unless indicated otherwise. Further details about incubation times and conditions for specific protein expression cultures are provided in the STAR Method details section.
Yeast cells were grown in liquid culture with appropriate antibiotics at 30°C shaking at 120 rpm or fermented. Further details are provided in the Key Resources Table and the STAR Method details section.
Sf9 cells and High Five cells were maintained in Sf-900 III SFM media (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and ESF-921 media (Expression Systems), respectively. Cells were cultured at 27°C at 60 rpm in flasks with volume ratios of 1:5 (High Five cells) or 1:10 (Sf9 cells). For recombinant protein expression, insect cells were supplemented with respective baculovirus supernatant in a 1:1000 (Sf9 cells) or 1:2000 (HighFive cells) ratio. Infected cells were incubated until viability dropped to 85%, which usually occurred within 72-80 hours past infection. Further details are provided in the Key Resources Table and the STAR Method details section.
Plasmids containing sequences for in vitro transcription scaffolds were prepared by round-the-horn (RTH) site-directed mutagenesis PCR and subsequent ligation using a modified pUC119 vector (ATCC) into which SrfI restriction sites had been introduced at positions 887 and 986. In the resulting template plasmids, the scaffold sequence was inserted between the SrfI sites, replacing the original segment at positions 888-921 but retaining it at positions 922-985. Plasmids encoding TFIIE variants were generated by round-the-horn (RTH) site-directed mutagenesis PCR and subsequent ligation using the original TFIIE expression vector with full-length Tfa1 and Tfa2 gene sequences ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50. Plaschka, C. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Dienemann, C. ... Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening Nature. 2016; 533 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ) as PCR template. While the produced mutant constructs contained the respectively altered Tfa1 genes they retained the original Tfa2 sequence. The C-terminal His 6 -tag on Tfa1 was preserved in all cases. Plasmid sequences are available upon request.
Expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II, TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE-FL, TFIIF and TFIIH was essentially performed as described ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50.

Cells were collected by centrifugation (7,900 g , 10 min, 4°C) and resuspended in lysis buffer L E (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.02% TWEEN 20 (v/v), 3 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.284 μg ml −1 leupeptin, 1.37 μg ml −1 pepstatin A, 0.17 mg ml −1 PMSF, 0.33 mg ml −1 benzamidine). Cell suspensions were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until purification.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) yeast strain rpb1-ΔCHL was generated by plasmid shuffling using a yeast strain with deletion of the genomic RPO21 ORF and extrachromosomal rescue plasmids which carried the RPO21 gene and warranted cell viability. Initial rescue plasmids pRS316- RPO21 and pRS315- RPO21 were obtained by amplifying Sc cDNA including the complete RPO21 ORF, 500 nt of its upstream and 250 nt of its downstream flanking sequence, and cloning it into pRS316 or pRS315 plasmids (ATCC) via XhoI/SacI restriction sites. A pRS315- RPO21 -His 10 plasmid with C-terminally tagged Rpb1 was created by in-frame insertion of a 10 x- His-tag gene sequence at the RPO21 C terminus. The final pRS315- RPO21Δ CHL-His 10 plasmid, in which amino acid residues 187-196 of the Rpb1-CHL were removed by deletion of the respective gene sequence from the RPO21 ORF, was produced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent).
The haploid Sc yeast strain rpb1-wt (BJ5464, rpo21Δ ::kanMX6, pRS316- RPO21 ) with deletion of the genomic RPO21 copy and the Rpb1-wt rescue plasmid pRS316- RPO21 was generated by sporulation and tetrad dissection as described ( Sun et al., 2012 63. Sun, M. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schulz, D. ... Comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis (cDTA) reveals mutual feedback between mRNA synthesis and degradation Genome Res. 2012; 22 :1350-1359 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rpb1-wt shuffle strain was transformed with plasmid pRS315- RPO21Δ CHL-His 10 . Single colonies were selected, streaked twice on SC-Leu-Ura plates (selecting for both pRS316- RPO21 and pRS315- RPO21Δ CHL-His 10 ) and then re-streaked twice on SC-Leu plates (selecting for pRS315- RPO21Δ CHL-His 10 ), thus permitting gradual loss of plasmid pRS316- RPO21 . To identify clones without pRS316- RPO21 , cells were then streaked two times on 5-FOA plates, which abolished growth of colonies containing the pRS316-encoded URA3 selection marker. Presence of the Rpb1-CHL deletion mutation in 5-FOA-unperturbed yeast clones was verified by sequencing of colony PCR-derived extrachromosomal plasmid DNA as well as protein mass spectrometry prior to final establishment of the rpb1-ΔCHL Sc yeast strain.
Protein purification was performed at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. Purification buffers were filtered and degassed prior to use. Preparation and assembly of Sc TBP and TFIIB as well as the Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH subcomplexes of the PIC were essentially carried out as reported ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50.

The Rpb1 clamp head loop mutant of Sc Pol II ( Figure S8 C) was purified according to the same instructions as the wild-type ( Sydow et al., 2009 64. Sydow, J.F. ∙ Brueckner, F. ∙ Cheung, A.C. ...

TFIIE variants ( Figures 6 , S9 A, and S9B) were purified by consecutive steps of affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Frozen E.coli cell pellets were thawed in a water bath at 25 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication and the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (79,000 g ; 60 min). The protein-containing soluble fraction was filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filters (Merck Millipore) and applied to a GE HisTrap HP (5 ml) column (GE Healthcare) that had been pre-equilibrated in buffer H E -5 (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM imidazole, 2 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.284 μg ml −1 leupeptin, 1.37 μg ml −1 pepstatin A, 0.17 mg ml −1 PMSF, 0.33 mg ml −1 benzamidine). After sample application the column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of buffer H E -5 and 5 CV of buffer H E -15 (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 15 mM imidazole, 2 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.284 μg ml −1 leupeptin, 1.37 μg ml −1 pepstatin A, 0.17 mg ml −1 PMSF, 0.33 mg ml −1 benzamidine). Bound protein was eluted with 5 CV buffer H E -250 (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 250 mM imidazole, 2 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.284 μg ml −1 leupeptin, 1.37 μg ml −1 pepstatin A, 0.17 mg ml −1 PMSF, 0.33 mg ml −1 benzamidine), pooled and dialyzed against buffer D E (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2% glycerol (v/v), 5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.28 μg ml −1 leupeptin, 1.37 μg ml −1 pepstatin A, 0.17 mg ml −1 PMSF, 0.33 mg ml −1 benzamidine) for 10-12 h. The dialyzed sample was applied to a GE HiTrap Heparin HP (5 ml) column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in buffer HEP E -240 (240 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2% glycerol (v/v), 5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol). The column was washed with 20 CV of buffer HEP E -240 and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0%–70% buffer HEP E -2000 (2 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2% glycerol (v/v), 5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol) in 15 CV. Fractions containing stoichiometric TFIIE dimer were pooled, concentrated with an Amicon Millipore 15 mL 10 000 MWCO centrifugal device (Amicon) and applied to a GE Superose12 10/300 GL size exclusion column pre-equilibrated in size exclusion buffer (200 mM KCl, 20 mM K-HEPES pH 7.0, 5% glycerol (v/v), 3 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to 4-5 mg ml −1 using an Amicon Millipore 6 mL 10 000 MWCO centrifugal device (Amicon), aliquoted, flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Typical yields were 2-5 mg per liter of E. coli culture, depending on the TFIIE variant.
Closed PIC was prepared as described ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) except that the cMed complex was omitted from the assembly and that a distinct buffer S (25 mM K-HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 2.5% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM TCEP) containing the transition state ATP-analog ADP-BeF 3 , instead of AMP-PNP, was added. The amount of buffer S and the concentration of the ATP-analog within were adapted such that the final sample was at a concentration of 150 mM potassium acetate and 1 mM ADP-BeF 3 . The HIS4 -promoter derived nucleic acid scaffold that was utilized for PIC formation remained unaltered ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). For complete assembly, PICs were incubated for 120 min shaking gently at 400 rpm All incubation steps were performed at 25 °C.
The PIC sample was centrifuged at 21,000 g for 10 min and then purified by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation with simultaneous crosslinking ( Kastner et al., 2008 27. Kastner, B. ∙ Fischer, N. ∙ Golas, M.M. ... GraFix: sample preparation for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :53-55 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ). The gradient was generated from equal volumes of a 15% sucrose solution (15% (w/v) sucrose, 150 mM potassium acetate, 25 mM K-HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 2.5% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM ADP-BeF 3 ) and a 40% sucrose solution (40% (w/v) sucrose, 150 mM potassium acetate, 25 mM K-HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 2.5% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM ADP-BeF 3 , 0.15% (v/v) glutaraldehyde crosslinker) with a BioComp Gradient Master 108 (BioComp Instruments). Centrifugation was performed at 175,000 g for 16 h at 4°C. Subsequently, 200 μl fractions were collected and quenched with a mix of 25 mM aspartate and 40 mM lysine for 10 min. Fractions were analyzed by native PAGE and Coomassie staining. Peak fractions containing crosslinked PIC were dialyzed for 8 h against buffer D G (150 mM potassium acetate, 25 mM K-HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM TCEP) in Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Devices (2 ml, 20,000 MWCO) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove sucrose and glycerol.
The dialyzed fractions containing PIC sample were centrifuged at 21,000 g for 10 min to remove potentially aggregated protein from the solution. A 2.8 nm thick homemade continuous carbon film was prepared with a high vacuum coater (Leica EM ACE600) and floated on the sample for 4-7 minutes. The support film containing adsorbed PIC particles was picked up onto R3.5/1 micromachined holey carbon grids (Quantifoil) without prior glow-discharging. Grids were covered with 3.5 μl of dialysis buffer, immediately blotted for 2-4 s and vitrified by plunging into liquid ethane with a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) operated at 4°C and 100% humidity.
Cryo-EM data were acquired on a FEI Titan Krios G2 transmission electron microscope (FEI) operated in EFTEM mode at 300 kV and equipped with a K2 Summit direct detector and a GIF Quantum energy filter (Gatan). Automated data acquisition was carried out using the FEI EPU software package at a nominal magnification of x130,000, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.05 Å per pixel. A total of 29,670 movie stacks were collected in counting mode of the K2 camera at a defocus range from −0.5 μm to −4.0 μm. Each movie stack contained 40 frames that were acquired over a 9 s exposure time window at a dose rate of 4.8 e − Å −2 s -1 , resulting in a total dose of 43.6 e − Å −2 per image.
Image frames for each movie were aligned, motion-corrected, contrast transfer function (CTF)-estimated and dose-weighted with the Warp package ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 65. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quality estimation of the resulting averaged micrographs and automated particle picking was performed with Warp using its implemented BoxNet neural network after retraining on 100 selected micrographs of the PIC dataset with defocus values ranging from −1.0 μm to −3.0 μm. In total, coordinates of 4.3 million particles were determined and exported. CTF correction and subsequent image processing were performed with the RELION-3 package (version 3.07) ( Nakane et al., 2018 41. Nakane, T. ∙ Kimanius, D. ∙ Lindahl, E. ...

For any refinement procedures, fully independent half-sets of the data were used (gold-standard). 3D classifications and refinements in which local masks were applied are referred to as ‘focused’. Post-processing of refined models was performed with automatic B-factor determination and sharpening in RELION, with the neural network-based ‘Noise2Map’ tool in the Warp package or with the ‘AutoSharpen’ ( Terwilliger et al., 2018 66. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Sobolev, O.V. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ... Automated map sharpening by maximization of detail and connectivity Acta Crystallogr. D Struct.

Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3348) PubMed Google Scholar ). Resolution was reported based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) (0.143 criterion) as described ( Chen et al., 2013 6. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution estimates were determined with the built-in tool of RELION using the previously assigned B-factors or a B-factor of 0 Å 2 . Masks used in image processing were generated with UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 46. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RELION.
Warp-derived particle coordinates were imported in RELION and the respective particles were extracted with a 200 2 pixel box (binned by 2), normalized and sorted for cPIC quality by using a combination of iterative rounds of reference-free 2D- and template-guided 3D classification with global image alignment. An initial reference model for 3D classification was generated by low-pass filtering the previous PIC map (EMDB accession code EMD-3846) ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) to 60 Å. The sorting process was performed in 5 batches, corresponding to 5 data collection sessions that contributed to the final dataset. Approximately 33% of the initial 4.3 million particles with very well discernible cPIC features were selected, merged into one dataset with 1.43 million particles, un-binned, re-extracted with a 380 2 pixel box and normalized. At this stage, the particles were subjected to global 3D refinement, followed by two rounds of CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing in RELION to correct CTF parameters and beam-induced particle motion. Global 3D classification revealed that 227,000 particles (16%) were present in classes with additional density for TFIIH ( Figure S1 D).
Further particle analysis was performed within two separate processing schemes, termed ‘cPIC’ and ‘PIC’ ( Figures S1 E and S2 ), to obtain the best possible resolution for all intrinsically flexible peripheral PIC components. Occupancy and conformational variation of the upstream complex (UC), TFIIF and 10-subunit Pol II core were assumed to be largely independent of TFIIH. Thus, classification and refinement of these components was performed using the complete dataset with both TFIIH-devoid cPIC and TFIIH-containing PIC particles (‘cPIC scheme’). In contrast, TFIIH status was assumed to strongly affect its direct interaction partners, TFIIE and the stalk of Pol II (Rpb4/7). These components, as well as TFIIH itself, were therefore analyzed using the 227,000-particle dataset containing complete PICs (‘PIC scheme’).
One additional round of reference-free 2D classification was applied in order to remove any remaining images with significant particle damage or contaminations. Good particles were combined and globally 3D refined against a 40 Å lowpass-filtered reference model containing the UC, TFIIF and 10-subunit Pol II. Next, an unmasked 3D classification with local changes in angles was performed to identify particles with well-defined signal for the UC. Respective classes were combined and subjected to local 3D refinement with a mask encompassing Pol II core and TFIIB. The resulting map was used as an input to yield high-resolution composite maps of the Pol II-TFIIB complex and the TFIIF region, as well as a high-resolution map of the UC, as outlined in Figure S1 E. In order to address the unrelated conformational flexibility of the peripheral cPIC regions, a strategy involving several rounds of focused 3D classifications without or with local image alignment and local 3D refinements with soft masks encompassing the regions of interest was employed. Final reconstructions were obtained from 934,763 particles for Pol II-TFIIB (at 2.5 Å), 173,154 particles for TFIIF (at 2.8 Å) and 156,629 particles for the UC (at 3.2 Å), reflecting the transient nature of the PIC. The composite maps for Pol II-TFIIB and TFIIF were generated from sets of half maps created after focused local 3D refinements with masks specific for smaller modules within the respective complex, as indicated in Figure S1 E. Such half maps with an improved local resolution were 2 x oversampled using RELION, aligned and resampled onto their ‘parent’ map (i.e., the map which had served as input for the applied focused refinements) and ultimately combined into ‘composite’ half maps using the ‘FrankenMap’ tool in the Warp package with custom masking. The final depicted composite maps were calculated from those composite half maps and post-processed with PHENIX as shown. An equivalent approach was applied for the generation of composite maps in the PIC scheme ( Figure S2 ) but in several cases multi-body refinement ( Nakane et al., 2018 41. Nakane, T. ∙ Kimanius, D. ∙ Lindahl, E. ... Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION eLife. 2018; 7 :e36861 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used in place of distinct focused 3D refinements.
An initial round of 3D classification with local angular searches and a 40 Å lowpass-filtered reference model encompassing Rpb4/7, TFIIE and TFIIH was performed. Classes with well-defined signal for TFIIH were combined and subjected to local 3D refinement with a soft mask encompassing TFIIH. At this stage, further processing was separated in two branches, one yielding a final high-resolution reconstruction of a consensus PIC ( Figure S2 A) and the second yielding several PIC reconstructions with different promoter DNA conformations at lower resolution (‘DNA scheme’; Figure S2 B). To arrive at the consensus PIC map, particles were first subjected to another round of local 3D classification with a tighter mask around TFIIH to remove persisting low-resolution TFIIH species. Classes containing high-quality TFIIH were pooled and globally 3D refined. For this step, a ‘non-binary’ mask encompassing the entire PIC was utilized.
Non-binary masks were generated to counteract the dominance of cPIC signal in particle alignment that is usually observed in PIC refinements without local masks. They consist of merged cPIC and TFIIH regions, with the TFIIH part behaving as a regular binary mask in which the area of interest (AoI) can assume values between 0 and 1, and with the cPIC part attenuated to an AoI limit < 1. Therefore, in a 3D refinement with a non-binary mask, the TFIIH signal contributes stronger to rotational and translational parameters that specify particle orientation for the reconstruction than the cPIC signal. Whereas the nominal resolution of 3D reconstructions obtained with non-binary and regular binary masks differed only marginally, the maps calculated with non-binary masks were of more uniform quality and resolution throughout the entirety of the PIC ( Figure S2 A, ‘Consensus PIC’). The angular distribution plots presented in Figure S3 were calculated based on 3D refinements performed with non-binary masks (referred to as ‘standard’ in the figure legend in distinction to composite maps that were generated by half-map merging).
The globally 3D refined particles were further refined locally with soft masks on either the cPIC (branch ‘A’, outlined in blue in Figure S2 A) or on TFIIH (branch ‘B’, outlined in pink in Figure S2 A), yielding reconstructions at 2.9 Å and 3.3 Å, respectively. To obtain cryo-EM maps with improved local resolution for the cPIC periphery, the complex was divided into 10 modules that were individually 3D refined to high resolution with local angular searches and a variety of soft masks, as indicated to the left in Figure S2 A. An equivalent strategy was applied to TFIIH and produced high-quality maps for the majority of the complex except for the Ssl2/Tfb2/Tfb5 cluster. Further local 3D classification with a soft mask around Ssl2/Tfb2/Tfb5/Tfb4/Ssl1 identified a subset of particles with particularly well-ordered Ssl2, albeit within two distinct overall TFIIH conformations. The two classes were combined (dashed pink outline in Figure S2 A) and subjected to local 3D refinement with a soft mask on Ssl2/Tfb2/Tfb5, resulting in a significantly improved reconstruction of this module, as indicated to the right in Figure S2 A. As described above, high-resolution reconstructions obtained for branches A and B were combined at the half-map stage and post-processed with the FrankenMap and Noise2Map tools of the Warp package to yield a final composite map of the consensus PIC at 2.9 Å nominal resolution. A detailed list of the focused 3D refinements that contributed to the final composite reconstruction is provided in Table S1 .
To further analyze the two apparently distinct TFIIH states with well-ordered Ssl2 that had resulted from the 3D classification on Ssl2/Tfb2/Tfb5/Tfb4/Ssl1, particles of each respective class were subjected to local 3D refinement with a soft mask around TFIIH. This yielded reconstructions of TFIIH in a contracted and an expanded conformation from 24,671 and 34,198 particles, both at 4.0 Å, respectively. For each TFIIH state, composite maps were generated according to the method described above (‘composite pipeline’) and the final resolution was improved to 3.6 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively, as indicated on the far right of Figure S2 A (outlined in green). A detailed list of the focused 3D refinements that contributed to the final composite reconstructions is provided in Table S1 .
The cryo-EM density of the consensus PIC in both the composite and the conventionally 3D refined (non-binary masked) maps appeared strongly heterogeneous with respect to the DNA trajectory between the E-wing and Ssl2. To address a potential co-existence of distinct DNA states within the complex, particles of an early ‘PIC scheme’ stage (after the initial 3D classification, see above) were globally aligned by unmasked 3D refinement. Next, 3D classification without image alignment using a soft mask around an ‘open-closed’ DNA hybrid was performed ( Figure S2 B), producing various classes with overall four clearly distinguishable DNA conformations. While the first type contained straight, continuous density for the DNA, the density in the second type was continuous but distorted. The trajectory of the DNA density in the third type resembled that in the second type but the density became diffuse in a region proximal to the Pol II clamp. The DNA density in the fourth type was discontinuous with a gap separating the upstream and downstream DNA regions. Moreover, the downstream DNA trajectory differed from the first three types and rather resembled the conformation in an initiation complex with open DNA in which DNA is located in the cleft of Pol II. Particles of the first two states with closed DNA were not further sub-classified due to low particle numbers. Particles of the third state with the weakened DNA duplex density in the Pol II clamp region were subjected to 3D classification without image alignment using a soft mask encompassing the DNA and proximal regions in Ssl2 and the central Pol II/TFIIE/Tfb1 interface ( Figure S2 B). As a result, particles were separated into classes containing density for almost unperturbed duplex DNA, for duplex DNA with an evident gap, and for duplex DNA with diffuse density that, however, still appeared continuous at higher threshold levels. The density of the latter class was thought to represent a relatively stable, non-mature transcription bubble in the DNA and thus chosen as a promising candidate for reconstruction of an intermediate state of the closed-to-open PIC transition. Particles of the fourth, presumably open DNA state, were equally sub-classified to select for those with particularly well-defined density for DNA and the adjacent protein domains. The particles selected for each identified DNA conformation were globally 3D refined with non-binary masks, followed by generation of a composite map for each state by the ‘composite pipeline’ discussed above. A detailed list of the focused 3D refinements that contributed to the final composite reconstructions is provided in Table S1 . Maps were post-processed with RELION, Warp or PHENIX packages, depending on individual performance. Ultimately, four reconstructions of the PIC with different DNA states were generated: a PIC with closed straight DNA (‘closed complex’, ‘CC’) at 3.4 Å from 11,014 particles, a PIC with closed distorted DNA (‘CC dist complex’) at 3.4 Å from 10,163 particles, a PIC with open DNA (‘open complex’, ‘OC’) at 3.2 Å from 23,887 particles and a PIC intermediate with an initial transcription bubble (‘intermediate complex’, ‘IC’) at 3.2 Å from 16,495 particles ( Figure S2 B). The PICs in the closed and open DNA states were dubbed based on their resemblance to previously observed nucleotide-free complexes with lower resolution (EMDB accession EMD-3383 (CC), EMD-0092 (CC dist ) and EMD-3846 (OC)).
Model building in the cPIC region was carried out using the post-processed maps of the upstream complex (UC), as well as the composite post-processed maps of Pol II-TFIIB and TFIIF ( Figure S1 E). Modeling of the complete PIC, including adjustment of the initially obtained cPIC model, was performed in the composite post-processed map of the ‘consensus PIC’ ( Figure S2 A). This ‘ground-truth’ model of the consensus PIC was then flexibly fitted and adjusted into composite maps of the PIC with distinct DNA conformations (CC, CC dist , IC and OC, Figure S2 B) or into composite maps of the two TFIIH states (‘expanded’, ‘contracted’) ( Figure S2 A). Initial model placement and rigid body docking into maps was executed in UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 46. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ...

Accurate fitting of specific domains as well as manual model modification and de-novo model building procedures were performed in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 10.

Models were real-space refined with rotamer restraints using the PHENIX suite ( Afonine et al., 2018 3. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ...

Coordinates of 10-subunit Pol II-TFIIB (exclusive of Rpb4/7) were obtained from our previous PIC structure ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB accession code 5OQJ ), rigid-body docked into the composite Pol II-TFIIB map and adjusted into the map using molecular dynamics flexible fitting with Namdinator ( Kidmose et al., 2019 28. Kidmose, R.T. ∙ Juhl, J. ∙ Nissen, P. ... Namdinator - automatic molecular dynamics flexible fitting of structural models into cryo-EM and crystallography experimental maps IUCrJ. 2019; 6 :526-531 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ) (standard parameters). Several chains, such as the TFIIB C terminus, were extended de-novo . The TFIIB reader domain was minorly pruned due to diffuse density ( Table S3 ). After real-space refinement in PHENIX, the Pol II-TFIIB model was rigid-body docked into the composite TFIIF map and merged with independently docked models for Tfg1 and Tfg2 from our previous PIC structure ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB accession code 5OQJ ). The N-terminal helix of Tfg1 and the Tfg1/Tfg2 dimerization domain were fitted separately, whereas the winged helix domain of Tfg2 was omitted from the model at this stage. Iterative rounds of manual model adjustment and real-space refinement were performed with TFIIF and the proximal domains of Pol II and TFIIB to optimize model quality. The remainder of the Pol II-TFIIB structure was unaltered and restrained from modification during refinement. The resulting TFIIF model was significantly improved and included sidechain information throughout. Moreover, additional domains like the charged region and the protrusion helices in Tfg1, as well as extensions in the dimerization domain, could be defined ( Figure 2 ; Table S3 ). In order to generate a minimal cPIC model with 10-subunit Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TBP, TFIIF and upstream DNA, the described strategy was repeated and the Pol II-TFIIB-TFIIF coordinates were combined with previously obtained models of the upstream complex (TBP/upstream DNA derived from the PIC structure ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB accession code 5OQJ ); TFIIA derived from the yeast TFIIA crystal structure (PDB accession code 1RM1 )) after fitting into the UC cryo-EM map. Optimization of upstream complex coordinates resulted in only minor local alterations to the structure ( Table S3 ).
Our previously obtained models of TFIIH, the Pol II stalk and TFIIE ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB accession code 5OQJ ) were rigid-body docked into the composite map of the consensus PIC and poorly fitting domains and subunits were improved in Coot. The structure was extended de-novo to include formerly unmodeled segments and sidechain information for all residues, which had been missing for large parts in TFIIE and TFIIH. In particular the C-termini of Tfa1 and Tfa2, the clutch domains of Tfb2 and Ssl2, the Ssl2 DRD and NTE domains, as well as a TBP – Tfa2-WH linker could be assigned ( Table S3 ). As expected, these regions in TFIIH agree well with the high resolution structures of H. sapiens TFIIH ( Greber et al., 2019 18. Greber, B.J. ∙ Toso, D.B. ∙ Fang, J. ... The complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex eLife. 2019; 8 :e44771 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kokic et al., 2019 30. Kokic, G. ∙ Chernev, A. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structural basis of TFIIH activation for nucleotide excision repair Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2885 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA bases bound by the Ssl2 ATPase were modeled de-novo . Since the sequence register of downstream DNA in the consensus PIC structure is ambiguous, the respective sequence of the CC dist complex (see below) was arbitrarily selected. The extended model was flexibly fitted into the cryo-EM map with Namdinator (standard parameters). Due to insufficient performance in the partially diffuse density of the Tfb2/Tfb5 dimerization domain, the affected protein segments were replaced with the coordinates of the aligned original crystal structure ( Kainov et al., 2008 26. Kainov, D.E. ∙ Vitorino, M. ∙ Cavarelli, J. ... Structural basis for group A trichothiodystrophy Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15 :980-984 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB accession code 3DOM ) ( Table S3 ). To arrive at a complete PIC model, the generated minimal cPIC structure (see above) and the winged helix domain of Tfg2 from our previous model ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB accession code 5OQJ ) were docked into the composite map of the consensus PIC, corrected for density-fit outliers and combined with the improved stalk/TFIIE/TFIIH model. A final consensus PIC model of high quality was then obtained by multiple rounds of iterative manual model adjustment in Coot and real-space refinement in PHENIX ( Figure S4 A).
Distinct structures for the various PIC conformations were generated on basis of the consensus PIC model by a common strategy. The consensus PIC model was rigid-body docked into the respective composite cryo-EM maps, followed by manual fitting of individual protein chains and adjustment of residues into the density in Coot. As upstream DNA trajectories deviated only minimally from the consensus model, the original DNA was retained until approximately one turn after the TBP-induced 90° bend. For all PIC states, the central DNA segment was modeled and modified in Coot, either from pieces of ideal B-DNA that were placed in the density and connected (CC, OC) or based on density-fitted DNA from a previous model (CC dist , PDB accession code 6GYM ). To obtain DNA for the IC state, a 6 nt bubble was built de-novo from individual nucleotides and incorporated into the CC dist DNA such that a good density-fit was achieved while base-stacking was preserved. Downstream DNA was generally obtained by fitting Ssl2-bound DNA from the consensus PIC model. We did not observe continuous density for the DNA template strand in the OC density but comparison with a model of the H. sapiens PIC in the open state ( He et al., 2016 23. He, Y. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Fang, J. ... Near-atomic resolution visualization of human transcription promoter opening Nature. 2016; 533 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggested that the yeast transcription bubble exceeds the size of the H. sapiens transcription bubble by approximately three nucleotides. Thus, the downstream DNA register of the OC was adjusted to fit a 15-nucleotide bubble. Unpaired nucleotides were appended to the template strand at the downstream DNA junction where the cryo-EM density could be interpreted confidently. The upstream, central and downstream DNA segments for each PIC variant were connected in Coot and merged with the adapted protein components derived from the consensus PIC model. To optimize final model quality, several rounds of iterative manual model adjustment in Coot and real-space refinement or geometry minimization with strict base-paring and -stacking restraints in PHENIX were applied ( Figure S4 A). An equivalent approach was chosen to generate models of contracted and expanded TFIIH, except for the removal of regions that were not included in the map (such as TFIIF) and for the limitation of DNA to the Ssl2-bound segment. The DNA sequence register in the expanded TFIIH structure corresponds to that of the OC, in contracted TFIIH to that of the IC, as these PIC states reflect the respective TFIIH conformations most closely.
The CC structure roughly resembles the previously reported yeast CC2 ( Plaschka et al., 2016 50. Plaschka, C. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Dienemann, C. ... Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening Nature. 2016; 533 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ) but additionally contains TFIIH, causing a moderate change in DNA trajectory and displacement of TFIIE. In contrast to CC2, CC reveals parts of the B-reader and the B-linker, likely due to higher resolution of the reconstruction. While the E-wing is mobile in both models, the Tfg2 WH wing and the CHL tip are disordered only in the CC. The CC dist structure is highly similar to that reported before ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ... Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :97-106.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a well-positioned E-wing and distorted DNA in the active center cleft. The primary difference between the CC dist models is the presence of a nucleotide analog and, consequently, a post-translocation conformation of the Ssl2 ATPase in the structure obtained in this study. In contrast, Ssl2 was observed in the pre-translocation conformation previously. Curiously, in comparison to the nucleotide-free CC dist state, the cPIC and TFIIH modules in the nucleotide-bound state appear to scrunch, indicating an overall contraction of the PIC. TFIIH adopts a generally expanded conformation in both CC dist structures, although individual regions in the Ssl2-Tfb2-Tfb5 cluster are slightly displaced with respect to each other as an effect of the change in ATPase state. These small differences, however, may result from inaccuracies due to the lower resolution of the previous CC dist structure and any functional importance therefore has to be interpreted with caution. Similar observations and impediments apply for comparison of the OC structure from this study with the previously reported nucleotide-free state containing pre-translocated Ssl2 ( Schilbach et al., 2017 59. Schilbach, S. ∙ Hantsche, M. ∙ Tegunov, D. ... Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and Mediator Nature. 2017; 551 :204-209 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both OC models contain TFIIH in an expanded conformation.
The in vitro transcription assays were an advancement of our previously reported assays with nuclear extracts ( Seizl et al., 2011 61. Seizl, M. ∙ Larivière, L. ∙ Pfaffeneder, T. ... Mediator head subcomplex Med11/22 contains a common helix bundle building block with a specific function in transcription initiation complex stabilization Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 :6291-6304 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were adapted to a recombinant system ( Noe Gonzalez et al., 2018 43. Noe Gonzalez, M. ∙ Sato, S. ∙ Tomomori-Sato, C. ... CTD-dependent and -independent mechanisms govern co-transcriptional capping of Pol II transcripts Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3392 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ) and further modified to increase efficiency. Utilized DNA template scaffolds were either complementary or contained mismatch bubbles with a size of 1, 2 or 5 nucleotides. Standard complementary scaffolds were prepared from pUC119 vectors that contained the natural GAT1 core promoter sequence and a ∼65 nucleotide window with a M13-reverse primer binding site, framed by two restriction sites for the blunt-end restriction endonuclease SrfI. The GAT1 promoter was selected due to its stable initially melted region, which renders events of spontaneous promoter opening highly unlikely ( Dienemann et al., 2019 9. Dienemann, C. ∙ Schwalb, B. ∙ Schilbach, S. ... Promoter Distortion and Opening in the RNA Polymerase II Cleft Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :97-106.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plasmids were obtained in large scale using a NucleoBond PC 10000 Giga kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL) and the linear scaffold DNA was excised (SrfI), PEG-precipitated and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. The features of the complete scaffold sequence (non-template: 5′-GGG CGC CCG GCC CAG CCA CAT ATA TAT AGG TGT GTG CCA CTC CCG GCC CCG GTA TTA GCA TGC ACG TTT TCT TTC CTT TGC TTT TCC GCC CTT CCC CTG TTC TGC TAA GCT TGG CGT AAT CAT GGT CAT AGC TGT TTC CTG TGT GAA ATT GTT ATC CGC TCA CAA TTC CGC CC-3′) are illustrated in Figure S8 A. Scaffolds for assays in which the effect of mismatch bubbles was investigated ( Figures 5 and S8 E–S8G) were assembled from single stranded DNA oligos with the following sequences: template 5′- GGG CGG AAT TGT GAG CGG ATA ACA ATT TCA CAC AGG AAA CAG CTA TGA CCA TGA TTA CGC CAA GCT TAG CAG AAC AGG GGA AGG GCG GAA AAG CAA AGG AAA GAA AAC GTG CAT GCT AAT ACC GGG GCC GGG AGT GGC ACA CAC CTA TAT ATA TGT GGC TGG GCC GGG CGC CC −3′; non-template (closed) 5′- GGG CGC CCG GCC CAG CCA CAT ATA TAT AGG TGT GTG CCA CTC CCG GCC CCG GTA TTA GCA TGC ACG TTT TCT TTC CTT TGC TTT TCC GCC CTT CCC CTG TTC TGC TAA GCT TGG CGT AAT CAT GGT CAT AGC TGT TTC CTG TGT GAA ATT GTT ATC CGC TCA CAA TTC CGC CC −3′; non-template (1 nt mismatch) 5′- GGG CGC CCG GCC CAG CCA CAT ATA TAT AGG TGT GTG CCA CTC CCG GCC CCG G A A TTA GCA TGC ACG TTT TCT TTC CTT TGC TTT TCC GCC CTT CCC CTG TTC TGC TAA GCT TGG CGT AAT CAT GGT CAT AGC TGT TTC CTG TGT GAA ATT GTT ATC CGC TCA CAA TTC CGC CC −3′; non-template (2 nt mismatch) 5′- GGG CGC CCG GCC CAG CCA CAT ATA TAT AGG TGT GTG CCA CTC CCG GCC CCG CA A TTA GCA TGC ACG TTT TCT TTC CTT TGC TTT TCC GCC CTT CCC CTG TTC TGC TAA GCT TGG CGT AAT CAT GGT CAT AGC TGT TTC CTG TGT GAA ATT GTT ATC CGC TCA CAA TTC CGC CC −3′; non-template (5 nt mismatch) 5′- GGG CGC CCG GCC CAG CCA CAT ATA TAT AGG TGT GTG CCA CTC CCG GCC GGT CA A TTA GCA TGC ACG TTT TCT TTC CTT TGC TTT TCC GCC CTT CCC CTG TTC TGC TAA GCT TGG CGT AAT CAT GGT CAT AGC TGT TTC CTG TGT GAA ATT GTT ATC CGC TCA CAA TTC CGC CC −3′. DNA oligos were purchased as PAGE-purified ultramers from Integrated DNA Technologies, resuspended in buffer (60 mM KCl, 3 mM K-HEPES pH 7.9, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 8 mM MgCl 2 and 3% (v/v) glycerol) to a concentration of 5 mM and stored at −20°C. To anneal the strands, template and respective non-template oligos were mixed in equimolar ratios, incubated at 95°C for 5 min and further incubated while the temperature was decreased in steps of 1°C per 30 s to a final 4°C.
Prior to the start of the in vitro transcription reaction, initiation complexes were reconstituted on scaffold DNA similarly to the preparation of PIC samples for cryo-EM analysis (see above). Incubation steps were performed at 25°C unless indicated otherwise. Per reaction, 1.6 pmol scaffold, 1.6 pmol TBP, 1.8 pmol Pol II, 2.7 pmol TFIIE and TFIIH, 9 pmol TFIIF, 9 pmol TFIIB and 18 pmol TFIIA were used, with TBP and DNA as the limiting components. PICs were assembled stepwise, starting with formation of individual TFIIE-TFIIH, Pol II-TFIIF and DNA-TFIIA-TFIIB-TBP complexes, which were incubated for 10 min each. In the meantime, a reaction mix was prepared from 2 x IVT buffer (120 mM KCl, 6 mM K-HEPES pH 7.9, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 16 mM MgCl 2 , 4% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 6% (v/v) glycerol), 1,4-dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor (Promega) and diluted to reach final assay conditions of 60 mM KCl, 3 mM K-HEPES pH 7.9, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 8 mM MgCl 2 , 2% (w/v) PVA, 3% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg ml −1 BSA and 20 units RNase inhibitor in a sample volume of 23.8 μl including DNA and protein components. The upstream complex (DNA-TFIIA-TFIIB-TBP) was pipetted to the reaction mix first and incubated for 60 s. Successively the Pol II-TFIIF complex and, after a 5 min incubation period, the TFIIE-TFIIH complex were added. To achieve complete PIC formation, the samples were incubated for another 30 min before they were cooled to 20°C. Transcription was initiated by addition of 1.2 μl of 10 mM NTPs and allowed to proceed for 50 min. Reactions were quenched by addition of 100 μl Stop buffer (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA) and 14 μl 10% SDS and treated with 4 μg proteinase K (New England Biolabs) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Nucleic acids were precipitated with 70% isopropanol in the presence of GlycoBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 6 hours at −20°C. Precipitated samples were resuspended in water and treated with 1 unit DNase I (New England Biolabs) for 15 minutes at 37°C to remove the DNA scaffold prior to analysis, followed by isopropanol precipitation. Precipitated samples were resuspended in 8 μl loading buffer (7 M urea, 1 x TBE), applied to urea gels (7 M urea, 1 x TBE, 6% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide 19:1) and separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE) in 1x TBE buffer for 45 minutes at 180 V. Gels were stained for 30 min with SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA products were visualized with a Typhoon 9500 FLA imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Readouts from urea – PAGE analysis of the RNA products were quantified with ImageJ. Information about statistical details of the experiments is provided in the respective figure legends. Generally, experiments were performed in four independent batches and the mean of these replicates was determined. Both the mean and the original data points are presented in the figures. Data were normalized to the mean of a ‘standard’ which is specified in the respective figure legends. Standard deviation was determined based on the four individual data points and is represented as error bars centered on the mean of the respective replicates. Statistical significance of the results was determined by applying a one-tailed unpaired t test assuming equal variances ( ∗∗∗ indicating a p-value < 0.001, ∗∗ indicating a p-value < 0.01 and ∗ indicating a p-value < 0.05) and is demarcated in the figures where appropriate.
