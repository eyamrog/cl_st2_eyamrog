Title: Sleep Loss Can Cause Death through Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species in the Gut


Abstract: Summary

The view that sleep is essential for survival is supported by the ubiquity of this behavior, the apparent existence of sleep-like states in the earliest animals, and the fact that severe sleep loss can be lethal. The cause of this lethality is unknown. Here we show, using flies and mice, that sleep deprivation leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequent oxidative stress, specifically in the gut. ROS are not just correlates of sleep deprivation but drivers of death: their neutralization prevents oxidative stress and allows flies to have a normal lifespan with little to no sleep. The rescue can be achieved with oral antioxidant compounds or with gut-targeted transgenic expression of antioxidant enzymes. We conclude that death upon severe sleep restriction can be caused by oxidative stress, that the gut is central in this process, and that survival without sleep is possible when ROS accumulation is prevented.

Section: Introduction

Sleep is an all-encompassing state that renders animals immobile and hypo-responsive to stimulation ( Campbell and Tobler, 1984 39. Campbell, S.S. ∙ Tobler, I. Animal sleep: a review of sleep duration across phylogeny Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1984; 8 :269-300 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ). A single answer is unlikely to explain the function of sleep since processes like cognition, immunity, and metabolism are all sleep dependent ( Krueger et al., 2016; Zielinski et al., 2016 128. Krueger, J.M. ∙ Frank, M.G. ∙ Wisor, J.P. ... Sleep function: Toward elucidating an enigma Sleep Med. Rev. 2016; 28 :46-54 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar 251. Zielinski, M.R. ∙ McKenna, J.T. ∙ McCarley, R.W. Functions and Mechanisms of Sleep AIMS Neurosci. 2016; 3 :67-104 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Countless clinical and experimental studies link insufficient sleep with serious health problems ( Chattu et al., 2018; Medic et al., 2017 44. Chattu, V.K. ∙ Manzar, M.D. ∙ Kumary, S. ...

Sleep. 2017; 9 :151-161 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ), and sleep restriction can lead to premature death in model organisms, including dogs, rats, cockroaches, and flies ( Bentivoglio and Grassi-Zucconi, 1997; Rechtschaffen et al., 1983; Shaw et al., 2002; Stephenson et al., 2007 17.

Biol. 2007; 210 :2540-2547 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We wanted to find out specifically what makes sleep required for survival in the most basic sense.
Sleep is generated by neurons, so it has been assumed that death observed with sleep deprivation results from impaired brain function. This idea is supported by the significant cognitive decline noticeable after sleep loss ( Donlea, 2019; Killgore, 2010; Krause et al., 2017 67. Donlea, J.M.

Neurosci. 2017; 18 :404-418 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two leading proposals for the brain-related restorative functions of sleep are downscaling of synapses formed during wakefulness ( Bushey et al., 2011; de Vivo et al., 2017; Diering et al., 2017; Gilestro et al., 2009; Tononi and Cirelli, 2014 36.

Sleep and the price of plasticity: from synaptic and cellular homeostasis to memory consolidation and integration Neuron. 2014; 81 :12-34 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (775) PubMed Google Scholar ) and clearance of harmful substances from interstitial brain areas ( Holth et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2013 102.

Sleep drives metabolite clearance from the adult brain Science. 2013; 342 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (1573) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because it is difficult to induce these processes during wakefulness or inhibit them during sleep, their contribution to the lethality associated with sleep deprivation is unknown. In addition to impairing cognition, sleep loss leads to dysfunction of the gastrointestinal, immune, metabolic, and circulatory systems ( Ali et al., 2013; Irwin, 2019; Khanijow et al., 2015; Koren and Taveras, 2018; McAlpine et al., 2019; Mullington et al., 2010; Tobaldini et al., 2019 3.

It is unclear whether these are secondary consequences of altered nervous system function or direct and independent effects of sleep deprivation. It is also unclear whether any of these impairments contribute to premature death of sleep-deprived animals. Given the diverse system failures, it is important to know whether a single intervention could prevent lethality in sleep-deprived animals or whether the longevity benefits of rescuing one problem would be masked by a host of other consequences incompatible with life. Prevention of death by a single means would argue that the gradual collapse of nearly all major bodily functions derives from a common origin.
One proposed function of sleep is prevention of oxidative stress in the brain ( Reimund, 1994 188. Reimund, E. The free radical flux theory of sleep Med. Hypotheses. 1994; 43 :231-233 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple studies have reported altered antioxidant response in the brain during sleep loss ( Alzoubi et al., 2012; D’Almeida et al., 1998; Hill et al., 2018; Kanazawa et al., 2016; Ramanathan et al., 2002; Silva et al., 2004; Singh and Kumar, 2008; Süer et al., 2011; Villafuerte et al., 2015 5.

Sleep deprivation and oxidative stress in animal models: a systematic review Oxid. Med. Cell.

Kempf, A. ∙ Song, S.M. ∙ Talbot, C.B. ... A potassium channel β-subunit couples mitochondrial electron transport to sleep Nature. 2019; 568 :230-234 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the brain does not appear to be significantly damaged by sleep deprivation ( Cirelli, 2006; Cirelli et al., 1999; de Souza et al., 2012; Eiland et al., 2002; Hipólide et al., 2002 50.

Neurosci. 2002; 112 :155-166 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), some labs have searched for signs of oxidative stress elsewhere. In rodents, the endogenous antioxidant defense is weakened in the liver ( Everson et al., 2005; Pandey and Kar, 2018 77. Everson, C.A. ∙ Laatsch, C.D. ∙ Hogg, N.

Longev. 2015; 2015 :234952 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). As there are no known localized origins of oxidative molecules during sleep deprivation, it is not known whether this oxidation is a cause or consequence of other damage and whether it is the reason why sleep-deprived animals die.
In our search for factors that directly link sleep loss and death, we took an agnostic approach in terms of anatomy, examining multiple tissues in parallel. Our first model was the fly since flies and mammals share core attributes of sleep ( Hendricks et al., 2000; Nitz et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2000 96. Hendricks, J.C. ∙ Finn, S.M. ∙ Panckeri, K.A. ...

After determining how long it takes for sleep deprivation to cause death, we examined various markers of cell damage in the days leading up to that point. We identified reactive oxygen species (ROS)—unstable, short-lived, and highly reactive molecules—as drivers of cellular damage and lethality during sleep deprivation. Endogenously generated ROS have important signaling roles ( Holmström and Finkel, 2014; Li et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2014; Mittler, 2017; Oswald et al., 2018; Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009; Schieber and Chandel, 2014 101.

ROS function in redox signaling and oxidative stress Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :R453-R462 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1951) PubMed Google Scholar ), but when their levels exceed the cellular antioxidant capacity, a chain of reactions is triggered that results in widespread oxidation ( D’Autréaux and Toledano, 2007; Schieber and Chandel, 2014 61. D’Autréaux, B. ∙ Toledano, M.B. ROS as signalling molecules: mechanisms that generate specificity in ROS homeostasis Nat. Rev. Mol.

Biol. 2014; 24 :R453-R462 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1951) PubMed Google Scholar ). The free radical forms of ROS are particularly reactive because their valence electrons are unpaired ( Dhawan, 2014 65. Dhawan, V.

To gain stability, they interact with macromolecules (DNA, proteins, lipids), stripping them of electrons and consequently destabilizing them ( Evans et al., 2004; Gutteridge and Halliwell, 1990; Halliwell, 2006; Stadtman and Levine, 2003 74.

Three independent methods of sleep deprivation in the fly led to accumulation of ROS in the gut, triggering oxidative stress in this organ. When deprivation was stopped, ROS and oxidative stress markers gradually cleared. Sleep deprivation in the mouse produced a similar outcome, with ROS accumulating specifically in the small and large intestines and triggering oxidative stress. We show in flies that accumulated ROS are causally linked to decreased survival, as clearing them from the gut (with oral antioxidant compounds or gut-targeted expression of antioxidant enzymes) can allow a normal lifespan with little to no sleep.

Section: Results

To study how severe sleep loss impacts survival, we looked for methods that can continually suppress most sleep. It is difficult to keep animals awake for a long time because a powerful homeostatic mechanism drives recovery of lost sleep; this compensatory mechanism is not well understood but is evident in rebound sleep seen after a night of sleep deprivation (i.e., animals sleep instead of being active) ( Allada et al., 2017; Hendricks et al., 2000; Huber et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2000 4.

Correlates of sleep and waking in Drosophila melanogaster Science. 2000; 287 :1834-1837 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ). As can be intuited ( Bringmann, 2019 25. Bringmann, H. Genetic sleep deprivation: using sleep mutants to study sleep functions EMBO Rep. 2019; 20 e46807 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), to reveal the full consequence of sleep loss, it is likely necessary to bypass the mechanisms that drive rebound sleep. Crucially, lack of such drive should not eliminate the physiological need for sleep, the same way that a lack of appetite would not eliminate the need for nutrients.
A common sleep deprivation method in flies relies on thermogenetic stimulation of various neurons whose activity suppresses sleep ( Dubowy et al., 2016; Kayser et al., 2014, 2015; Liu et al., 2012, 2016; Nall et al., 2016; Seidner et al., 2015; Sitaraman et al., 2015; Vienne et al., 2016 68.

Age-Related Reduction of Recovery Sleep and Arousal Threshold in Drosophila Sleep (Basel). 2016; 39 :1613-1624 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested most Gal4 drivers known to target such neurons, using them to express the heat-activated cation channel TrpA1 ( Hamada et al., 2008 92. Hamada, F.N. ∙ Rosenzweig, M. ∙ Kang, K. ... An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila Nature. 2008; 454 :217-220 Crossref Scopus (565) PubMed Google Scholar ). At 21°C, TrpA1 is closed, so this temperature was used to raise animals and monitor baseline sleep. Increasing the ambient temperature to 29°C causes TrpA1 to open and neurons to be stimulated as a consequence. Sleep was reduced with all Gal4s, but in most cases, animals could not be kept awake for more than several days (data not shown). Fortunately, some Gal4s have been shown to target neurons whose activation causes severe sleep loss without triggering a compensatory increase in sleep drive; when deprivation is stopped, animals resume normal sleep-wake cycles without seeking extra sleep ( Seidner et al., 2015 201. Seidner, G. ∙ Robinson, J.E. ∙ Wu, M. ... Identification of Neurons with a Privileged Role in Sleep Homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :2928-2938 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this characterization, such Gal4s were effective at suppressing sleep through life ( Figure 1 ). We used two Gal4s in parallel ( Figures 1 A–1D) to increase our confidence that whatever phenomena we observe are generalizable. The conclusions we reached with this approach were later supported by other methods of deprivation, including those that trigger sleep rebound.
When TrpA1 was expressed in neurons labeled by 11H05- or 60D04-Gal4 (11H05>TrpA1, 60D04>TrpA1), flies lost ∼90% of sleep ( Figures 1 A–1D). In each case, sleep-deprived animals died earlier than their non-deprived parental controls ( Figure 1 E). High mortality became apparent around day 10 of deprivation ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Greater sleep loss triggered earlier death in individual flies ( Figure 1 F). If deprivation was stopped on day 10, the surviving animals established normal sleep-wake cycles and lived as long as the controls ( Figure 1 G). The lifespan of flies extends at lower temperatures (21°C versus 29°C); regardless, there was no difference in survival between the experimental genotypes and the controls ( Figure 1 G, left), suggesting that at least some major negative consequences of sleep deprivation are reversible.
To find out how long the impact of sleep deprivation lingers in the body, we deprived flies of sleep for 10 days, allowed different groups of animals to sleep ad libitum for different time durations, and then restricted their sleep again. Being allowed to sleep for 5 or 10 days was insufficient to erase the impact of the first bout of deprivation ( Figure 1 H, first two graphs). If the period of unrestricted sleep was extended to 15 days, flies seemed fully recovered ( Figure 1 H, last graph), as it took 20 days before they all died (comparable with Figure 1 E). These results suggest a gradual accumulation of damage during sleep loss that is also gradually repaired during recovery sleep.
Because mortality increased around day 10 of sleep deprivation ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and 2 A), we examined various markers of cell damage in the preceding days, throughout the body. Most tissues appeared indistinguishable between sleep-deprived and non-deprived animals, except for one major difference: the guts of deprived animals had increased levels of ROS ( Figures 2 B and 2 C). High ROS levels were mostly observed in the midgut, which spans much of the gut length but has clear boundaries ( Figure 2 D; Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2018 155. Miguel-Aliaga, I. ∙ Jasper, H. ∙ Lemaitre, B. Anatomy and Physiology of the Digestive Tract of Drosophila melanogaster Genetics. 2018; 210 :357-396 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). ROS are inherently unstable because of high reactivity and are consequently difficult to detect. This problem can be circumvented with probes that form stable fluorescent products when oxidized by ROS ( Chen et al., 2011; Hardy et al., 2018 46. Chen, X. ∙ Tian, X. ∙ Shin, I. ... Fluorescent and luminescent probes for detection of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species Chem. Soc. Rev. 2011; 40 :4783-4804 Crossref Scopus (675) PubMed Google Scholar 94. Hardy, M. ∙ Zielonka, J. ∙ Karoui, H. ... Detection and Characterization of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species in Biological Systems by Monitoring Species-Specific Products Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2018; 28 :1416-1432 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dihydroethidium (DHE) is considered the most sensitive and specific among such probes and is used to detect superoxide radicals in living (non-fixed) tissues. DHE emits blue fluorescence unless oxidized, in which case it intercalates into DNA and fluoresces red ( Kalyanaraman et al., 2017 114. Kalyanaraman, B. ∙ Hardy, M. ∙ Podsiadly, R. ... Recent developments in detection of superoxide radical anion and hydrogen peroxide: Opportunities, challenges, and implications in redox signaling Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2017; 617 :38-47 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Superoxide is a precursor of other ROS ( Babior, 1997; Fridovich, 1997 10. Babior, B.M. Superoxide: a two-edged sword Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1997; 30 :141-155 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 81. Fridovich, I. Superoxide anion radical (O2-.), superoxide dismutases, and related matters J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 :18515-18517 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), so DHE fluorescence should probably be taken as a general reporter of reactive species and free radicals. Staining was performed on whole tissues because their small size allows DHE penetration ( Vaccaro et al., 2017 232. Vaccaro, A. ∙ Issa, A.R. ∙ Seugnet, L. ... Drosophila Clock Is Required in Brain Pacemaker Neurons to Prevent Premature Locomotor Aging Independently of Its Circadian Function PLoS Genet. 2017; 13 :e1006507 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). A different fluorescent probe, thought to be predominantly oxidized by hydrogen peroxide ( Cathcart et al., 1983 42. Cathcart, R. ∙ Schwiers, E. ∙ Ames, B.N. Detection of picomole levels of hydroperoxides using a fluorescent dichlorofluorescein assay Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134 :111-116 Crossref Scopus (680) PubMed Google Scholar ), also reported an increase in ROS levels specifically in the gut ( Figure S1 A).
ROS accumulation was gradual, peaking on day 10 of sleep deprivation ( Figures 2 E, top row, and 2F and data not shown). When deprivation was stopped, ROS levels gradually decreased ( Figures 2 E, bottom row, and 2 F), coming close to baseline after 15 days ( Figure 2 F), which is also how long it took for survival curves to reset after sleep deprivation was stopped ( Figure 1 H). ROS levels remained slightly elevated relative to pre-deprivation levels even after 20 days of recovery (data not shown).
The two Gal4 lines used for sleep deprivation have almost no expression in the gut, except for several cells that can be detected with a bright fluorescent nuclear marker ( Barolo et al., 2004 13. Barolo, S. ∙ Castro, B. ∙ Posakony, J.W. New Drosophila transgenic reporters: insulated P-element vectors expressing fast-maturing RFP Biotechniques. 2004; 36 :436-440, 442 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 B). Still, we ensured that our observations did not stem from TrpA1-dependent activation of gut cells. Expression and activation of TrpA1 in different cell populations in the gut (enterocytes, using myo1A-gal4 [ Buchon et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2009 33. Buchon, N. ∙ Osman, D. ∙ David, F.P. ...

Micchelli, C.A. ∙ Perrimon, N. Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium Nature. 2006; 439 :475-479 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ]) did not affect sleep, longevity, or ROS levels ( Figures S1 C–S1H). We conclude that sleep deprivation is the most likely cause of ROS increase in the gut. To strengthen this conclusion and ensure that ROS accumulation is not limited to methods that do not trigger sleep rebound, we used additional approaches to prevent sleep.
Several modes of mechanical agitation have been used for acute, short-term sleep deprivation in Drosophila ( Hendricks et al., 2000; Huber et al., 2004; Kayser et al., 2014; Li et al., 2009; Seugnet et al., 2008; Shaw et al., 2000, 2002 96.

Stress response genes protect against lethal effects of sleep deprivation in Drosophila Nature. 2002; 417 :287-291 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Exposing flies to vibrations did cause sleep reduction, but with high variability across individuals ( Figures 3 A and 3D) and across days ( Figure 3 B). The variability was presumably due to habituation but also the fact that the compensatory sleep drive increases in response to mechanical deprivation ( Hendricks et al., 2000; Huber et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2000 96. Hendricks, J.C. ∙ Finn, S.M. ∙ Panckeri, K.A. ... Rest in Drosophila is a sleep-like state Neuron. 2000; 25 :129-138 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar 103.

Correlates of sleep and waking in Drosophila melanogaster Science. 2000; 287 :1834-1837 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this interpretation, rebound sleep was observed immediately after the agitation was stopped ( Figure 3 C). The extreme variability of sleep loss, and the fact that wings and legs were often damaged by shaking, made it difficult to correlate the observed shortening of lifespan (data not shown) with sleep loss. Despite this limitation, we could ask whether sleep loss induced by mechanical deprivation leads to ROS accumulation. Most flies exhibited significant sleep loss on the first day, but their sleep increased subsequently (e.g., Figure 3 A, inconsistent sleep loss). A minority of flies consistently lost most of their sleep for up to a week (e.g., Figure 3 A, consistent sleep loss). Because they experienced identical mechanical agitation but different sleep amounts, animals could be directly compared to reveal the effect of sleep loss on ROS levels. In agreement with the thermogenetic approach, ROS accumulated in the gut and only in animals that experienced sustained sleep loss ( Figure 3 E). This supports the idea that sleep deprivation itself causes ROS accumulation. The fact that ROS levels increase with deprivation methods that either do (mechanical; Figure 3 C) or do not (thermogenetic; Figure 1 G, center and right) activate the sleep homeostat supports the notion that the physiological need for sleep is separable from sleep drive (i.e., preventing sleepiness would not obviate the need for sleep).
For the third deprivation method, we used loss-of-function mutations or RNAi against known sleep regulators: Cyclin A (CycA) ( Afonso et al., 2015; Rogulja and Young, 2012 1.

SLEEPLESS is a bifunctional regulator of excitability and cholinergic synaptic transmission Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :621-629 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). As in the original studies, sleep was reduced with neuronal RNAi against Cyclin A (elav>CycA RNAi ) ( Figures 3 F and S2 A) or mutations in redeye ( rye T227M ) ( Figures 3 H and S2 B), sleepless ( sss Δ40 ) ( Figures 3 J and S2 C), and insomniac ( inc 2 ) ( Figures 3 L and S2 D). In agreement with the other two deprivation methods, ROS levels were elevated in the gut of these chronically deprived flies ( Figures 3 G, 3I, 3K, and 3M), reinforcing the idea that insufficient sleep leads to ROS accumulation.
Lifespan was reduced by all of these genetic manipulations ( Figures S2 A–S2D), as previously described ( Koh et al., 2008; Rogulja and Young, 2012; Stavropoulos and Young, 2011 125.

Stavropoulos, N. ∙ Young, M.W. insomniac and Cullin-3 regulate sleep and wakefulness in Drosophila Neuron. 2011; 72 :964-976 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to inc mutants, nervous system-specific depletion of Inc was reported not to shorten lifespan ( Hill et al., 2018; Stavropoulos and Young, 2011 97. Hill, V.M. ∙ O’Connor, R.M. ∙ Sissoko, G.B. ... A bidirectional relationship between sleep and oxidative stress in Drosophila PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 :e2005206 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar 216. Stavropoulos, N. ∙ Young, M.W. insomniac and Cullin-3 regulate sleep and wakefulness in Drosophila Neuron. 2011; 72 :964-976 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). These flies (elav>inc RNAi ) were indeed not short lived ( Figure S2 G), but their sleep phenotype ( Figure S2 E) was milder than that of inc 2 mutants ( Figures 3 L and S2 D) and was not sustained ( Figure S2 F). Consistent with the no-mortality phenotype, ROS levels were not elevated in elav>inc RNAi flies ( Figure S2 H), suggesting that they have not accumulated sufficient sleep debt. Sleep loss may not be the only cause of premature death in sleep mutants because the affected proteins function broadly. For example, Inc and SSS function at larval neuromuscular synapses ( Li et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2010 138. Li, Q. ∙ Kellner, D.A. ∙ Hatch, H.A.M. ... Conserved properties of Drosophila Insomniac link sleep regulation and synaptic function PLoS Genet. 2017; 13 :e1006815 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar 240.

SLEEPLESS, a Ly-6/neurotoxin family member, regulates the levels, localization and activity of Shaker Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13 :69-75 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, insufficient sleep and high ROS levels in the gut are phenotypes shared by these mutants. The general rule seems to be that ROS accumulate when sleep falls below a certain threshold, which correlates with increased mortality. The one verified example of severely sleep-deprived flies with normal longevity supports the proposed ROS-mortality link. Dopamine transporter fumin ( fmn ) mutations cause sleep loss without affecting lifespan ( Kume et al., 2005 129. Kume, K. ∙ Kume, S. ∙ Park, S.K. ... Dopamine is a regulator of arousal in the fruit fly J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :7377-7384 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S2 I). The guts of fmn mutants exhibited normal ROS levels, even after a month of severe sleep loss ( Figure S2 J). We have not yet uncovered the mechanisms that prevent ROS accumulation in this case; regardless, we conclude that a normal lifespan with little sleep is possible if ROS levels in the gut are kept low.
ROS can destroy cellular macromolecules through oxidation ( Evans et al., 2004; Gutteridge and Halliwell, 1990; Stadtman and Levine, 2003 74. Evans, M.D. ∙ Dizdaroglu, M. ∙ Cooke, M.S.

As predicted from their high ROS levels, guts from sleep-deprived flies showed extensive evidence of oxidative stress ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Oxidation is harmful to DNA ( Cadet and Wagner, 2013; Evans et al., 2004 37. Cadet, J. ∙ Wagner, J.R. DNA base damage by reactive oxygen species, oxidizing agents, and UV radiation Cold Spring Harb.

DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139 J. Biol.

Scully, R. ∙ Xie, A. Double strand break repair functions of histone H2AX Mutat. Res. 2013; 750 :5-14 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). This approach revealed widespread DNA damage in the gut ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Oxidation also triggers adaptive pathways ( Espinosa-Diez et al., 2015; Ma, 2013; Navarro-Yepes et al., 2014 73.

Oxidative stress and autophagy: the clash between damage and metabolic needs Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22 :377-388 Crossref Scopus (627) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 4 A and 4B). Sustained oxidation can ultimately cause cells to die ( Redza-Dutordoir and Averill-Bates, 2016 187. Redza-Dutordoir, M. ∙ Averill-Bates, D.A. Activation of apoptosis signalling pathways by reactive oxygen species Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 :2977-2992 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ); markers of apoptosis and necrosis were observed throughout the gut ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Although these signs of cellular damage fit the notion of oxidative stress where ROS are the inducers of damage, there are other interpretations; in some contexts, ROS can be downstream of cell-death-triggering signals ( Kanda et al., 2011; Pérez et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2009 116.

RIP3, an energy metabolism regulator that switches TNF-induced cell death from apoptosis to necrosis Science. 2009; 325 :332-336 Crossref Scopus (1120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Arguing that cellular damage and cell death are a consequence rather than the cause of ROS increase, all oxidative stress markers appeared only after ROS began accumulating ( Figures 4 C and 4D). When sleep deprivation was stopped and ROS levels gradually decreased, markers of oxidative stress decreased as well ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Because the gut has high regenerative capacity ( Amcheslavsky et al., 2009; Buchon et al., 2009b; Jiang et al., 2009; van der Flier and Clevers, 2009 6. Amcheslavsky, A. ∙ Jiang, J. ∙ Ip, Y.T.

The widespread cell death raised the possibility that the gut becomes structurally damaged and leaky, which we tested with a commonly used method based on addition of unabsorbable blue dye to food. If the intestinal barrier is abnormally permeable, such as in old flies, the entire body turns blue due to an open circulatory system ( Rera et al., 2011 189. Rera, M. ∙ Bahadorani, S. ∙ Cho, J. ... Modulation of longevity and tissue homeostasis by the Drosophila PGC-1 homolog Cell Metab. 2011; 14 :623-634 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). With this method, we could not detect a difference between deprived and non-deprived animals ( Figure S3 C), which suggests that gut permeability was not majorly altered. We noticed that the guts of sleep-deprived animals seemed to contain more food ( Figure S3 C). This was due not to impaired excretion ( Figure S3 D, right) but to increased food intake ( Figure S3 D, left), consistent with other sleep studies in humans and model organisms ( Baud et al., 2013; Everson et al., 1989; Greer et al., 2013; Koban et al., 2008; Markwald et al., 2013; Mavanji et al., 2013; Newman et al., 2009; Rechtschaffen and Bergmann, 1995 14.

We later present examples of sleep-deprived animals that do not eat more than controls but still have high ROS levels, which indicates that overeating is not the cause of ROS accumulation.
We tested the generalizability of our findings in a mammalian model. With gentle but continuous mechanical stimulation, C57BL/6J mice were deprived of sleep for up to 5 days ( Figure 5 ). In each repetition of the experiment, 5 mice were housed in a deprivation setup from Pinnacle Technology ( Hines et al., 2013; Naidoo et al., 2014 98. Hines, D.J. ∙ Schmitt, L.I. ∙ Hines, R.M. ...

Aging and sleep deprivation induce the unfolded protein response in the pancreas: implications for metabolism Aging Cell. 2014; 13 :131-141 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) where a slowly rotating bar caused them to move more frequently. As controls, 5 mice were housed in an identical setup but without the bar rotating. Sleep deprivation was confirmed with electroencephalogram (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG) ( Figure 5 A), although the recordings were taken in singly housed mice and might be under-representing the extent of sleep loss in group-housed mice. Group housing caused animals to disturb each other (our observation): if one mouse was awake, it likely disrupted the sleep of other mice.
Internal organs from sleep-deprived and non-deprived mice were processed in parallel; they were harvested, sliced, and probed for ROS using DHE. Compared with the non-deprived controls, sleep-deprived animals had elevated ROS levels specifically in the small and large intestines ( Figures 5 B and 5C). The increase in the small intestine was obvious after 2 days of deprivation, whereas the increase in the large intestine (colon) was less obvious because of the seemingly higher basal ROS levels ( Figures 5 B and 5C). There were no evident changes in ROS in the other examined tissues, even after 5 days ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Sleep-depriving a different mouse strain (CBA/CaJ) produced a similar outcome, with ROS levels high in the small and large intestines but not in the brain or liver ( Figures S4 A–S4C). When deprivation was stopped, mice engaged in rebound sleep ( Figure S4 D), supporting our earlier conclusion that ROS accumulation occurs regardless of the presence or absence of compensatory sleep pressure.
Markers of DNA damage, stress granules, and cell death were not observed after 2 days but could be clearly detected in the small and large intestines after 5 days of sleep deprivation ( Figure 5 D), again indicating that ROS are a cause rather than a consequence of cellular damage. The weight of sleep-deprived mice dropped by ∼10% during the first 24 h of deprivation and then remained stable for the rest of the experiment ( Figure S4 E, left). Food intake was comparable with the controls ( Figure S4 E, right), suggesting that the increase in ROS levels is not caused by excessive eating. Despite the evidence mentioned earlier, food intake is not always increased during sleep restriction ( Barf et al., 2012; Caron and Stephenson, 2010 12. Barf, R.P. ∙ Van Dijk, G. ∙ Scheurink, A.J. ... Metabolic consequences of chronic sleep restriction in rats: changes in body weight regulation and energy expenditure Physiol. Behav. 2012; 107 :322-328 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Caron, A.M. ∙ Stephenson, R. Energy expenditure is affected by rate of accumulation of sleep deficit in rats Sleep. 2010; 33 :1226-1235 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). As would be consistent with another study ( Koban et al., 2008 124. Koban, M. ∙ Sita, L.V. ∙ Le, W.W. ... Sleep deprivation of rats: the hyperphagic response is real Sleep. 2008; 31 :927-933 PubMed Google Scholar ), the severity and length of sleep deprivation that we imposed on mice may not have been sufficient to appreciably change their appetite. Yet, these conditions were sufficient to induce ROS accumulation in the gut. We conclude that the impact of sleep loss on the gut is evolutionarily conserved and is separable from food consumption.
Our results reveal a correlation between sleep deprivation, ROS accumulation, and premature death. To test causality, we asked whether clearing ROS could extend survival without increasing sleep itself. Through food supplementation, we tested 53 individual compounds known to have antioxidant properties, identifying 11 that allowed a normal or near-normal lifespan ( Figures 6 A and 6B). These included compounds that directly neutralize ROS through electron donation (e.g., lipoic acid, quercetin, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl [TEMPO]) as well as compounds that boost the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (e.g., N-acetyl-L-cysteine [NAC] and sodium phenylbutyrate [PBA]). Figure 6 B shows examples of survival curves for three rescuing compounds: melatonin, lipoic acid, and NAD. The compounds that were able to rescue survival were effective at clearing ROS ( Figure 6 C and data not shown), unlike the non-rescuing compounds we examined ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Rescue of survival was achieved without increasing sleep itself; all animals remained sleep deprived when supplemented with antioxidants (if anything, average sleep was reduced further) ( Figure 6 D). This was true even for melatonin, primarily known for its effects on the mammalian circadian clock ( Pfeffer et al., 2018 176. Pfeffer, M. ∙ Korf, H.W. ∙ Wicht, H. Synchronizing effects of melatonin on diurnal and circadian rhythms Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2018; 258 :215-221 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Melatonin does not seem to play a major role in controlling circadian rhythmicity or sleep in flies ( Hardeland and Poeggeler, 2003 93. Hardeland, R. ∙ Poeggeler, B. Non-vertebrate melatonin J. Pineal Res. 2003; 34 :233-241 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). A lesser known fact is that melatonin is a potent antioxidant ( Tan et al., 2015 221. Tan, D.X. ∙ Manchester, L.C. ∙ Esteban-Zubero, E. ... Melatonin as a Potent and Inducible Endogenous Antioxidant: Synthesis and Metabolism Molecules. 2015; 20 :18886-18906 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), produced at high levels in the vertebrate gut ( Bubenik, 2002 29. Bubenik, G.A. Gastrointestinal melatonin: localization, function, and clinical relevance Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47 :2336-2348 Crossref Scopus (470) PubMed Google Scholar ). In flies, the rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, is highly expressed in the gut ( Brodbeck et al., 1998 26. Brodbeck, D. ∙ Amherd, R. ∙ Callaerts, P. ... Molecular and biochemical characterization of the aaNAT1 (Dat) locus in Drosophila melanogaster : differential expression of two gene products DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17 :621-633 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent study showed that circulating melatonin levels decrease with sleep deprivation in mice ( Gao et al., 2019 83. Gao, T. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Dong, Y. ... Role of melatonin in sleep deprivation-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in mice J. Pineal Res. 2019; 67 :e12574 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with our findings, the authors found that melatonin supplementation attenuates mucosal injury and dysbiosis in the gut ( Gao et al., 2019 83. Gao, T. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Dong, Y. ... Role of melatonin in sleep deprivation-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in mice J. Pineal Res. 2019; 67 :e12574 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our data, this effect of melatonin could be attributed to its antioxidant properties.
Together, these results draw a direct connection between sleep deprivation-induced oxidative stress and mortality. If antioxidants can mean the difference between life and death for sleep-deprived animals, one might predict life extension under non-deprived conditions. Indeed, some groups have observed beneficial effects of antioxidants on the healthspan and lifespan of flies ( Kang et al., 2002 117. Kang, H.L. ∙ Benzer, S. ∙ Min, K.T. Life extension in Drosophila by feeding a drug Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :838-843 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, supplementation with melatonin, lipoic acid, NAD, or PBA, at doses that had rescuing effects during sleep deprivation, did not affect the survival of non-deprived animals ( Figure S5 C). This argues for a context-dependent value of antioxidants.
Compounds given through food easily reach gut cells, but we could not exclude the possibility that they also reach other organs and have some protective effects there. To directly test the role of the gut, we expressed antioxidant enzymes in this tissue. This required two separate transgenic expression systems: one in neurons for thermogenetic sleep deprivation and the other in the gut for enzyme expression. The LexA/LexAop system ( Lai and Lee, 2006 130. Lai, S.L. ∙ Lee, T. Genetic mosaic with dual binary transcriptional systems in Drosophila Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9 :703-709 Crossref Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ) is similar to the Gal4/UAS system ( Brand and Perrimon, 1993 24. Brand, A.H. ∙ Perrimon, N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes Development. 1993; 118 :401-415 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). There are no available LexA drivers specific to the gut, whereas such Gal4 drivers exist, so we searched for LexAs to use for sleep deprivation.
After screening through ∼150 sparsely expressed LexAs from the FlyLight collection ( Jenett et al., 2012; Pfeiffer et al., 2010 108. Jenett, A. ∙ Rubin, G.M. ∙ Ngo, T.T. ... A GAL4-driver line resource for Drosophila neurobiology Cell Rep. 2012; 2 :991-1001 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (619) PubMed Google Scholar 178. Pfeiffer, B.D. ∙ Ngo, T.T. ∙ Hibbard, K.L. ... Refinement of tools for targeted gene expression in Drosophila Genetics. 2010; 186 :735-755 Crossref Scopus (496) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified two (50A07- and 68A07-LexA) that allow long-term and consistent thermogenetic sleep deprivation ( Figures 7 A, 7B, S6 A, and S6B). The two lines show little expression in the gut ( Figure S6 C). Similar to what we observed using Gal4s, sleep deprivation with LexAs lead to premature death ( Figure S6 D). 50A07-LexA caused nearly complete sleep loss and precipitated death faster than 68A07-LexA, which caused ∼85% sleep loss ( Figures 7 B, S6 B, and S6D). 50A07-LexA-dependent deprivation was not accompanied by increased food intake ( Figure S6 E), which was contrary to the Gal4-dependent sleep deprivation but similar to the mouse experiments, reinforcing the idea that excessive food consumption is not at the root of sleep deprivation-triggered lethality. We combined 50A07-LexA with two independent Gal4 drivers expressed throughout the midgut in the most prevalent cell type, nutrient-absorbing enterocytes (the widespread pattern of oxidative stress in the gut pointed to enterocytes as the most likely cell type involved). The Gal4s used were mex1-Gal4 ( Phillips and Thomas, 2006 179. Phillips, M.D. ∙ Thomas, G.H. Brush border spectrin is required for early endosome recycling in Drosophila J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119 :1361-1370 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 C, left) and myo1A-Gal4 ( Buchon et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2009 33. Buchon, N. ∙ Osman, D. ∙ David, F.P. ...

Cytokine/Jak/Stat signaling mediates regeneration and homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut Cell. 2009; 137 :1343-1355 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (571) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S7 A). mex1-Gal4 shows no expression in the central nervous system ( Figure 7 C, left); myo1A-Gal4 has been reported not to be expressed in the brain ( Takeishi et al., 2013 220. Takeishi, A. ∙ Kuranaga, E. ∙ Tonoki, A. ... Homeostatic epithelial renewal in the gut is required for dampening a fatal systemic wound response in Drosophila Cell Rep. 2013; 3 :919-930 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), but with a more sensitive detection method (a brighter fluorescent reporter coupled with immunolabeling), we detected some expression there ( Figure S7 A; also reported by Dai et al., 2019 62. Dai, X. ∙ Zhou, E. ∙ Yang, W. ... D-Serine made by serine racemase in Drosophila intestine plays a physiological role in sleep Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1986 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of this, and because of a previous report suggesting oxidative stress in neurons of sleep-deprived flies ( Hill et al., 2018 97. Hill, V.M. ∙ O’Connor, R.M. ∙ Sissoko, G.B. ... A bidirectional relationship between sleep and oxidative stress in Drosophila PLoS Biol. 2018; 16 :e2005206 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also attempted to rescue survival using elav-Gal4, a driver that is expressed in most neurons and largely excluded from the gut ( Figure 7 C, right; Chen et al., 2016 47. Chen, J. ∙ Reiher, W. ∙ Hermann-Luibl, C. ... Allatostatin A Signalling in Drosophila Regulates Feeding and Sleep and Is Modulated by PDF PLoS Genet. 2016; 12 :e1006346 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). This allowed us to compare survival between sleep-deprived animals overexpressing antioxidant enzymes throughout the gut (mex1-Gal4 and myo1A-Gal4) versus the nervous system (elav-Gal4).
Gut-targeted overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1 or 2 (SOD1 and SOD2, respectively) or catalase (CAT) using mex1-Gal4 ( Figure 7 D, top left) or myo1A-Gal4 ( Figure S7 B) rescued the survival of animals sleep-deprived with 50A07-LexA. The presence of myo1A-Gal4 (and, to a lesser extent, mex1-Gal4) somewhat reduced the long-term efficiency of sleep deprivation, independent of transgene expression (i.e., sleep levels gradually increased over the lifetime in any animal that had myo1A-Gal4 [ Figure S7 C, top left] or mex1-Gal4 [ Figure S7 C, top right]) for reasons we do not understand. Regardless, during the initial 11 days (the time it took for the sleep-deprived animals with no expression of transgenic antioxidant enzymes to die), average sleep loss was only weakly affected by myo1A-Gal4 ( Figure S7 C, bottom left) and not affected by mex1-Gal4 ( Figure S7 C, bottom right). Moreover, loss of sleep throughout the lifespan was comparable between sleep-deprived flies overexpressing antioxidant enzymes with mex1-Gal4 and the sleep-deprived controls ( Figure 7 D, bottom left).
In contrast to gut-targeted overexpression, nervous system-targeted overexpression of antioxidant enzymes did not have a major rescuing effect, although lifespan was extended by several days ( Figure 7 D, top right). This is consistent with the absence of noticeable ROS accumulation in the nervous system during sleep deprivation ( Figures 2 B and 2C). The minor rescue obtained with elav-Gal4 did not result from an increase in sleep ( Figure 7 D, bottom right) and could mean that there is some contribution of the nervous system to lethality, but it could also result from the sparse elav-Gal4 expression in the gut ( Chen et al., 2016 47. Chen, J. ∙ Reiher, W. ∙ Hermann-Luibl, C. ... Allatostatin A Signalling in Drosophila Regulates Feeding and Sleep and Is Modulated by PDF PLoS Genet. 2016; 12 :e1006346 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ).
With mex1- or myo1A-Gal4-driven overexpression of antioxidant enzymes, ROS levels in the gut were brought down to baseline (SOD1 or SOD2 overexpression) or even seemingly below (CAT overexpression) ( Figures 7 E, left, and S7 D and S7 F, left, and S7 G). DNA damage and apoptosis were no longer detectable ( Figures 7 E, center and right, and S7 E and S7 F, center and right, and S7 H), directly demonstrating that ROS are the cause of cellular damage in the gut of sleep-deprived flies. The efficacy of the mex1- or myo1A-Gal4-dependent rescue suggests that enterocytes are the major source of ROS in the gut upon sleep deprivation. With elav-Gal4-driven overexpression of antioxidant enzymes, ROS levels in the gut remained high ( Figure S6 F). When flies were sleep-deprived with the other LexA line (68A07-LexA), and SOD1, SOD2, or CAT were overexpressed in the gut using myo1A-Gal4, lifespan was also extended ( Figures S6 G and S6H). The results of these rescue experiments reinforce our conclusion that the gut is the main source of lethal ROS during severe sleep loss ( Figure 7 F).

Section: Discussion

Our study uncovered a cause of death upon experimental sleep deprivation. One caveat of this and other sleep deprivation studies in animal models is the accompanying overall increase in physical activity that could contribute to ROS production through higher energy expenditure. We do not think that this is a major factor behind the observed phenomena because sleep is not merely a period of immobility. Metabolic changes associated with normal daily sleep-wake cycles are separable from changes in locomotion ( Bonnet et al., 1991; Stahl et al., 2017 23. Bonnet, M.H. ∙ Berry, R.B. ∙ Arand, D.L. Metabolism during normal, fragmented, and recovery sleep J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 71 :1112-1118 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 213. Stahl, B.A. ∙ Slocumb, M.E. ∙ Chaitin, H. ... Sleep-Dependent Modulation of Metabolic Rate in Drosophila Sleep (Basel). 2017; 40 zsx084 PubMed Google Scholar ), and increased locomotion by itself does not seem to contribute significantly to the increased metabolic rate and energy expenditure during experimental sleep deprivation ( Barf et al., 2012; Bergmann et al., 1989; Caron and Stephenson, 2010 12. Barf, R.P. ∙ Van Dijk, G. ∙ Scheurink, A.J. ... Metabolic consequences of chronic sleep restriction in rats: changes in body weight regulation and energy expenditure Physiol. Behav. 2012; 107 :322-328 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar 19. Bergmann, B.M. ∙ Everson, C.A. ∙ Kushida, C.A. ... Sleep deprivation in the rat: V. Energy use and mediation Sleep. 1989; 12 :31-41 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Caron, A.M. ∙ Stephenson, R. Energy expenditure is affected by rate of accumulation of sleep deficit in rats Sleep. 2010; 33 :1226-1235 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, intense physical activity increases the levels of ROS in muscles ( Powers and Jackson, 2008 182. Powers, S.K. ∙ Jackson, M.J. Exercise-induced oxidative stress: cellular mechanisms and impact on muscle force production Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88 :1243-1276 Crossref Scopus (1290) PubMed Google Scholar ), but we did not detect changes in this tissue, suggesting that our observations do not stem simply from physical exhaustion. The second caveat is that we were able to study survival and demonstrate rescue only with thermogenetic deprivation because only this approach allowed consistent and sustained sleep suppression without any obvious side effects. Regardless, ROS accumulation was observed with different methods of suppressing sleep and at different temperatures. Two of these methods (thermogenetics and mutations in sleep genes) suppress sleep without triggering (or weakly triggering) an increase in homeostatic sleep pressure, but mechanical agitation robustly engages the homeostat. From this, we conclude that the physiological need for sleep can be separated from the compensatory sleep drive, consistent with the fact that other drives, such as hunger ( Luquet et al., 2005 145. Luquet, S. ∙ Perez, F.A. ∙ Hnasko, T.S. ... NPY/AgRP neurons are essential for feeding in adult mice but can be ablated in neonates Science. 2005; 310 :683-685 Crossref Scopus (689) PubMed Google Scholar ), are separable from the physiological need they represent.
How does sleep deprivation lead to ROS accumulation? Why does this take place in the gut? It might be that ROS clearance is a daily sleep function, but it is also possible that sleep deprivation generates unique adverse conditions that lead to ROS accumulation. ROS levels may result from increased production, decreased elimination, or both. Prolonged wakefulness could affect the gut directly, but ROS accumulation could also be a consequence of signaling from the nervous system or other tissues.
The vast majority of ROS (∼90%) are generated during mitochondrial oxygen-dependent ATP synthesis ( Balaban et al., 2005 11. Balaban, R.S. ∙ Nemoto, S. ∙ Finkel, T. Mitochondria, oxidants, and aging Cell. 2005; 120 :483-495 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2677) PubMed Google Scholar ), making this organelle an obvious candidate for the relevant ROS source. Metabolism increases during sleep disruption ( Barf et al., 2012; Bonnet et al., 1991; Caron and Stephenson, 2010; Everson et al., 1989; Everson and Wehr, 1993; Stahl et al., 2017; Valenti et al., 2017 12.

The concentration of atmospheric oxygen changed significantly several times in Earth’s history, which is thought to have led to eukaryotic and multicellular life ( El Albani et al., 2010; Sessions et al., 2009 71.

Oxygen use increased the efficiency of ATP production ( Stamati et al., 2011 215. Stamati, K. ∙ Mudera, V. ∙ Cheema, U. Evolution of oxygen utilization in multicellular organisms and implications for cell signalling in tissue engineering J. Tissue Eng. 2011; 2 2041731411432365 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) but came with the price of having to neutralize reactive and potentially toxic oxygen derivatives ( Fischer et al., 2016; Taverne et al., 2018 80. Fischer, W.W. ∙ Hemp, J. ∙ Valentine, J.S. How did life survive Earth’s great oxygenation? Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2016; 31 :166-178 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 222.

Reactive Oxygen Species: Radical Factors in the Evolution of Animal Life: A molecular timescale from Earth’s earliest history to the rise of complex life BioEssays. 2018; 40 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Entering a resting state characterized by reduced metabolism could temper ROS production by decreasing the rate of redox reactions. The gut appeared early in evolution ( Stainier, 2005 214. Stainier, D.Y. No organ left behind: tales of gut development and evolution Science. 2005; 307 :1902-1904 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ) and could be uniquely sensitive to metabolic perturbations. It is not clear, however, whether the gut has any special energetic demands ( Aiello and Wheeler, 1995 2. Aiello, L.C. ∙ Wheeler, P. The Expensive Tissue Hypothesis: the brain and the digestive system in human and primate evolution Curr. Anthropol. 1995; 36 :199-221 Crossref Google Scholar ) that explain the increase in ROS seen there. Moreover, increasing mitochondrial activity in the gut can actually reduce ROS levels and extend lifespan ( Rera et al., 2011 189. Rera, M. ∙ Bahadorani, S. ∙ Cho, J. ... Modulation of longevity and tissue homeostasis by the Drosophila PGC-1 homolog Cell Metab. 2011; 14 :623-634 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another potential source of ROS is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where ROS are routinely made as byproducts of oxidative protein folding ( Shimizu and Hendershot, 2009 207. Shimizu, Y. ∙ Hendershot, L.M.

ER stress (the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins) can lead to oxidative stress, as increased demand for protein folding leads to greater ROS production; ER stress also induces mitochondria to produce more ROS ( Cao and Kaufman, 2014; Santos et al., 2009; Zeeshan et al., 2016 40.

Alternatively, sleep deprivation could directly induce ER stress in the gut. In both scenarios, ER stress in the gut may lead to oxidative stress in this tissue.

Symbiotic lactobacilli stimulate gut epithelial proliferation via Nox-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species EMBO J. 2013; 32 :3017-3028 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nox is hyperactivated by dysbiosis ( Iatsenko et al., 2018 104. Iatsenko, I. ∙ Boquete, J.P. ∙ Lemaitre, B.

This might be relevant because sleep deprivation reportedly affects gut microbiota ( Benedict et al., 2016; El Aidy et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2019; Poroyko et al., 2016 16.

Human and rat gut microbiome composition is maintained following sleep restriction Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E1564-E1571 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intestinal Nox is also activated by stressors other than dysbiosis ( Patel et al., 2019 173. Patel, P.H. ∙ Pénalva, C. ∙ Kardorff, M. ... Damage sensing by a Nox-Ask1-MKK3-p38 signaling pathway mediates regeneration in the adult Drosophila midgut Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4365 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ), and sleep deprivation could be one such stressor. The gut has the ability to receive distress signals from other tissues ( Berendzen et al., 2016; Liu and Jin, 2017; Ulgherait et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018 18.

For example, sterile external wounds can cause a ROS increase in the fly gut, which promotes enterocyte turnover and improves survival ( Takeishi et al., 2013 220. Takeishi, A. ∙ Kuranaga, E. ∙ Tonoki, A. ... Homeostatic epithelial renewal in the gut is required for dampening a fatal systemic wound response in Drosophila Cell Rep. 2013; 3 :919-930 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). ROS levels could similarly start increasing as a protective response in the gut during periods of insufficient sleep. Under natural conditions, animals likely fall asleep before ROS reach dangerously high levels. We consider this scenario possible because antioxidant compounds sometimes accelerated death of sleep-deprived animals (if given too early or at doses that were too high, data not shown).
ROS could accumulate not only through increased production but decreased clearance. Inadequate neutralization coupled with constant production in the gut ( Campbell and Colgan, 2019; Jones and Neish, 2017; Pérez et al., 2017b 38. Campbell, E.L. ∙ Colgan, S.P. Control and dysregulation of redox signalling in the gastrointestinal tract Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2019; 16 :106-120 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar 111.

Med. 2017; 104 :75-103 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) could explain gradual accumulation of these molecules. Nrf2 (CnC in flies) is a conserved master antioxidant regulator whose basal activity is higher in the fly gut than in other tissues ( Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008 219. Sykiotis, G.P. ∙ Bohmann, D. Keap1/Nrf2 signaling regulates oxidative stress tolerance and lifespan in Drosophila Dev. Cell. 2008; 14 :76-85 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ). A transcription factor, Nrf2 becomes stabilized and translocates into the nucleus only under oxidative conditions to induce expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes ( Ma, 2013; Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008; Tonelli et al., 2018 146.

A defect in this mechanism could result in gut-biased ROS accumulation. At least several antioxidant compounds that rescued the survival of sleep-deprived flies can act on Nrf2 ( Rochette et al., 2013; Vriend and Reiter, 2015 191. Rochette, L. ∙ Ghibu, S. ∙ Richard, C. ... Direct and indirect antioxidant properties of α-lipoic acid and therapeutic potential Mol. Nutr.

The nervous system has high energetic demands, and neuronal ATP production is almost certain to rise during prolonged wakefulness, which is expected to elevate ROS levels. The lack of damage, as proposed previously ( Cirelli, 2006 50. Cirelli, C. Cellular consequences of sleep deprivation in the brain Sleep Med. Rev. 2006; 10 :307-321 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), might be at least partially explained by efficient activation of antioxidant and cytoprotective mechanisms in sleep-deprived brains ( Brown et al., 2017; Cirelli et al., 2004, 2005b, 2006; Cirelli and Tononi, 2000; Hill et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2008; Naidoo et al., 2005; Nikonova et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2000; Terao et al., 2003, 2006 28.

Stem cells, self-renewal, and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71 :241-260 Crossref Scopus (938) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the gut is plastic in terms of proliferation, recovery from oxidative damage when deprivation is stopped may rely mostly on turning cells over rather than repairing them. It will be informative to test whether sleep promotes active repair of cellular damage in the gut, similar to the way it facilitates DNA damage repair in neurons ( Bellesi et al., 2016; Zada et al., 2019 15.

Oxidative damage might interfere with the absorptive function of the gut, and the increased feeding seen during sleep loss ( Baud et al., 2013; Everson et al., 1989; Koban et al., 2008; Mavanji et al., 2013; Newman et al., 2009; Rechtschaffen and Bergmann, 1995 14.

In agreement with this idea, a high-calorie diet can delay death of sleep-deprived rats ( Everson and Wehr, 1993 75. Everson, C.A. ∙ Wehr, T.A. Nutritional and metabolic adaptations to prolonged sleep deprivation in the rat Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264 :R376-R387 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Accumulated intestinal ROS might have systemic effects, for example by altering the gut microbial profile through direct bactericidal action or through modulation of gut immunity ( Campbell and Colgan, 2019; Ha et al., 2005; Yardeni et al., 2019 38.

Intestinal ROS could also trigger a systemic inflammatory response independently of microbiota ( Wu et al., 2012 241. Wu, S.C. ∙ Liao, C.W. ∙ Pan, R.L. ...

Because ROS are important signaling molecules at physiological levels ( Holmström and Finkel, 2014; Jones, 2006; Li et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2014; Mittler, 2017; Oswald et al., 2018; Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009; Schieber and Chandel, 2014 101.

Severe conditions were presented here, but mild deprivation also leads to ROS accumulation in the gut, albeit slower (data not shown). This means that our results are likely relevant for chronic insufficient sleep in humans, especially considering that, among the many pathologies associated with sleep restriction ( Chattu et al., 2018 44.

Reactive oxygen species in inflammation and tissue injury Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 20 :1126-1167 Crossref Scopus (1141) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to oxidation of other organs. With a longer deprivation protocol than we describe in mice, oxidative DNA damage was indeed seen, in addition to the small intestine, in the lung and the liver of rats ( Everson et al., 2014 78. Everson, C.A. ∙ Henchen, C.J. ∙ Szabo, A. ... Cell injury and repair resulting from sleep loss and sleep recovery in laboratory rats Sleep (Basel). 2014; 37 :1929-1940 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recognize that what kills extremely sleep-deprived animals might not reflect what sleep does daily. Regardless, our findings demystify the observation that extreme sleep loss can cause death and show that it is possible to decrease the cost of forced wakefulness.

All Drosophila stocks used in this study are listed in the key resources table. Mutant flies were compared to wild-type controls of the same genetic background. Flies were maintained on cornmeal-agar medium in 12 hours light:12 hours dark cycles (12:12 LD), unless indicated otherwise. The cornmeal-agar medium was composed of agar (7.3%, Spectrum), yeast (12.7%, MP Biomedicals), sugar (56%, Domino), and cornmeal (24%, Bunge). To make 4 L of cornmeal-agar medium, water temperature was brought to ∼50°C. Agar, yeast, sugar, and cornmeal were added slowly, with constant stirring to prevent clumping. Temperature was increased until bubbles formed (around 97°C), after which the heat was turned off. Once temperature dropped to 75°C, propionic acid (100 ml) and Tegosept + ethanol (95.2 g in 367.2 ml) were added and water was adjusted to compensate for evaporation. The mix was left for 15 minutes before pouring into vials, to allow homogenization. All experiments were performed using adult males and carried out in incubators purchased from Tritech Research Inc. (standard DigiTherm model) and Percival Scientific Inc. (DR36VL model).
2-month-old male C57BL/6J (JAX 000664) and CBA/CaJ (JAX 000654) mice were housed according to standard protocols approved by the Harvard University Standing Committee on Animal Care in accordance with federal guidelines. On arrival to our animal facility, mice were housed in pathogen-free cages (max 5 per cage) under 12:12 LD cycles, at 23°C and 50% humidity. They were given standard Pico Lab Rodent Diet 20 # 5053, and water.
Locomotor activity and sleep were tracked using commercially available Drosophila Activity Monitors (DAMs, TriKinetics). Individual males were placed into 65 mm-long glass tubes (TriKinetics) containing ∼20 mm of cornmeal-agar food. Locomotor activity data were collected from the DAM System (TriKinetics) using DAM5M monitors, unless indicated otherwise. Each DAM5M monitor measures locomotor activity of 32 flies. 4 independent infrared beams are positioned across each tube. As a fly walks back and forth, it interrupts the infrared beams, leaving a record of when and where it moved. Total movement counts across the 4 beams were recorded and summed every minute. In experiments using mechanical sleep deprivation and RNAi against Cyclin A ( CycA RNAi ), DAM2 activity monitors were used. These monitors also measure activity of up to 32 individual flies, but there is only 1 infrared beam to monitor movement, potentially under-reporting total movements. Data from DAM5M or DAM2 monitors were then analyzed using a custom MATLAB software (available on github at https://github.com/CrickmoreRoguljaLabs/SleepAnalysis ). A sleep episode was defined as inactivity lasting at least five minutes, based on the original characterization of fly sleep ( Andretic and Shaw, 2005; Nitz et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2000 7.

For each genotype/condition, average daily sleep was calculated for the entire lifespan, unless indicated otherwise. Locomotor activity data were collected at either 25°C ( redeye ( rye T227M ), sleepless ( sss Δ40 ), insomniac ( inc 2 ) and fumin rec19 ( fmn ) mutants, insomniac RNAi ( inc RNAi ) and mechanical sleep deprivation); 27°C (RNAi against Cyclin A ( CycA RNAi )), or 29°C (Thermogenetic deprivation). Glass tubes were replaced every 2-3 days to avoid food desiccation. For antioxidant feeding assays, the antioxidant compounds were added to food at concentrations listed below.
Thermogenetic sleep deprivation was performed using the Gal4/UAS and LexA/LexAop systems. Flies were raised in 12:12 LD cycles at 21°C until day 4-5 post-eclosion, after which males were loaded into TriKinetics glass tubes and placed in DAM5M monitors. After one day of baseline sleep recording at 21°C, temperature was raised to constant 29°C, which triggered sleep deprivation. Deprivation was done in 12:12 LD cycles, except for the experiments involving the LexA/LexAop system – these were done in constant darkness because deprivation using the LexA lines was more consistent in the absence of light.
Mechanical sleep deprivation was performed at 25°C using a multi-tubes vortexer (VWR) modified by TriKinetics to house DAM2 activity monitors. Flies were raised at 25°C (12:12 LD) until day 4-5 post-eclosion, when males were loaded into tubes. After a day of baseline sleep recording, the multi-tubes vortexer delivered 2 s-long vibrations at random intervals centered around 60 s (±30 s). The intensity of the vortexer was set to 7.
Sleep rebound was measured after one night (12 hours, ZT12-ZT24) of mechanical sleep deprivation. Rebound sleep (Δ sleep) was calculated for each fly by subtracting the amount of sleep on the morning before deprivation (ZT0-ZT4) from the amount of sleep on the morning (ZT0-ZT4) following the deprivation.
Survival was measured on cornmeal-agar medium. In all survival experiments, males were transferred to fresh vials or tubes every 2-3 days, without using CO 2 . Each survival experiment was performed at least twice. For thermogenetic sleep-deprivation experiments, crosses were kept at 21°C (12:12 LD). Newly eclosed flies were collected every two days and kept at 21°C (12:12 LD) until day 4-5 post-eclosion. Males were then transferred to 29°C under either 12:12 LD cycles (for deprivation experiments using Gal4/UAS) or to constant darkness (for deprivation experiments using LexA/LexAop). For CyclinA RNAi ( CycA RNAi ) experiments, crosses were kept at 25°C (12:12 LD). Newly eclosed males (day 0-1 post-eclosion) were transferred to 27°C (12:12 LD), as in the original publication. redeye ( rye T227M ), sleepless ( sss Δ40 ), insomniac ( inc 2 ) and fumin rec19 ( fmn ) mutants, as well as crosses of insomniac RNAi ( inc RNAi ) were maintained at 25°C (LD 12:12). Newly eclosed males (0-1 days post-eclosion) were collected and kept at 25°C (LD 12:12) until death. For genetic rescue of LexA-dependent thermogenetic sleep deprivation and for redeye ( rye T227M ) and sleepless ( sss Δ40 ) mutants, single flies were loaded into TriKinetics glass tubes and placed in TriKinetics DAM2 or DAM5M monitors to assess survival (only locomotor data from DAM5M monitors were used for calculating sleep amount, due to better resolution. Death was determined on the day when locomotor activity stopped permanently, as evident by locomotor activity recordings. At least 15 males per genotype per experiment were tested. In all the other survival experiments, males were placed into standard fly vials. At least 3 vials per genotype per experiment were used, with 10-20 animals per vial. We initially tested if survival depended on the number of animals per vial (10 versus 15 versus 20) and on whether the flies were grouped in vials or placed individually in TriKinetics glass tubes, and did not observe any difference (data not shown). Survival with antioxidant feeding was measured as described above, but with single flies in TriKinetics glass tubes. At least 10 males per genotype per condition per experiment were tested. Flies were counted as dead if they failed to move (e.g., leg movements) in response to taps on the side of the vials or tubes.
Individual antioxidant compounds were diluted in the appropriate solvent (H 2 O, DMSO or EtOH) and added to the cornmeal-agar food. Animals were put on this food after 6 complete days at 29°C (Day 12 post-eclosion, Figures 6 and S5 ), and transferred to fresh tubes every 2-3 days (without using CO 2 ) to avoid compound degradation and food desiccation. Antioxidants were used at the following final concentrations: Coenzyme-Q10, 1 mM (in EtOH); Ebselen, 1 mM (in DMSO); Glutathione, 5 mM (in DMSO); Lipoic acid, 2 mM (in EtOH); Melatonin, 100 μg/ml (in EtOH); Methylene blue, 5 mM (in H 2 O); NAC, 20 mM (in H 2 O); NAD, 10 mM (in DMSO); PBA 20 mM (in H 2 O); Quercetin 5 mM (in DMSO); Resveratrol, 10 mM (in DMSO); TEMPO, 10 mM (in DMSO); TMPyP, 10 mM (in H 2 O); Vitamin C, 40 mM (in H 2 O).
After 5 days (Gal4-dependent sleep deprivation) or 4 days (LexA-dependent sleep deprivation) at 29°C, males were transferred from standard cornmeal-agar medium to otherwise identical media containing 2% (wt/vol) FD&C Blue #1. 24 hours later, feeding on blue food was interrupted by freezing the vials at −20°C. Frozen flies were transferred to Eppendorf tubes (5 males per tube), decapitated (to prevent the eye pigment from interfering with the subsequent measurement), and homogenized with a motorized pestle (VWR) in 50 μL 1X-PBS + 1% Triton X-100. Samples were centrifuged to clear the debris and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 660 nm (A660) on a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Flies fed regular non-blue food were used as controls, and their A660 values were subtracted from experimental values. Serial dilutions of the dye were used to generate a standard curve. The dye concentration of each sample was determined using the linear fit of the standard curve. For each genotype, a minimum of 15 males were tested.
FD&C blue #1 dye was added at a concentration of 2.5% (wt/vol) to standard cornmeal-agar medium. Males were maintained on dyed medium from the first day of sleep deprivation until death. Smurf flies are characterized by blue coloration present outside the digestive tract. We did not observe any Smurf phenotypes in sleep-deprived flies : the blue coloration stayed restricted to the gut.
Adult males were anesthetized on ice and briefly washed with 70% ethanol before tissue dissection in 1X-PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline). Guts were fixed for 1 hour on a shaker at room temperature in fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS). Samples were then washed 3 times for 20 minutes each in PBS, and incubated overnight in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 + 2% BSA, at 4°C. Staining with primary antibodies was carried out for ∼24 hours at 4°C in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 + 2% BSA. Samples were then washed 3 times for 20 minutes in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 + 2% BSA. Three 20-minute final washes were performed in PBS. Guts were mounted between glass slides and coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using either Vectashield Antifade Mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) in the case of anti-FMR1 staining, or Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen) for other stainings. All samples were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (as described below).
Primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-FMR1 (1:60, DSHB), chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Aves), mouse anti-γH2Av (1:40, DSHB), rabbit anti-dsRed that recognizes mCherry (1:100, Takara Bio). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, 1:1000); Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, 1:100).
Adult males were anesthetized on ice and briefly washed with 70% ethanol before dissection in PBS. Dissected brains were fixed for 25 minutes on a shaker at room temperature, in fixative containing 4% PFA in PBS. Samples were then washed 3 times for 20 minutes each in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 + 2% BSA at 4°C. Staining with primary antibodies was carried out for ∼48 hours at 4°C in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 + 2% BSA (∼72 hours when Bruchpilot staining was included). Samples were then washed 3 times for 20 minutes each in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated for ∼48 hours with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 + 2% BSA. Finally, three 20-minute washes were performed using PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 followed by a 20-minute wash in PBS. Brains were mounted between glass slides and coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen), and imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (as described below).
Primary antibodies used were: chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Aves), mouse anti-Bruchpilot (1:7, DSHB), rabbit anti-dsRed that recognizes mCherry (1:100, Takara Bio). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, 1:100); Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse, (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, 1:1000).
Expression patterns of 11H05-Gal4, 60D04-Gal4, 50A07-LexA, and 68A07-LexA in the nervous system were visualized with a membrane-targeted GFP, mCD8::GFP ( Lee and Luo, 1999 133. Lee, T. ∙ Luo, L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis Neuron. 1999; 22 :451-461 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2002) PubMed Google Scholar ), stained with anti-GFP antibodies. Antibodies against Bruchpilot (Brp), a presynaptic cytoskeletal protein ( Wagh et al., 2006 238. Wagh, D.A. ∙ Rasse, T.M. ∙ Asan, E. ... Bruchpilot, a protein with homology to ELKS/CAST, is required for structural integrity and function of synaptic active zones in Drosophila Neuron. 2006; 49 :833-844 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (559) PubMed Google Scholar ), were used to visualize the nervous system. The expression of these lines in the gut was visualized with the bright nuclear fluorescent reporter RedStinger ( Barolo et al., 2004 13. Barolo, S. ∙ Castro, B. ∙ Posakony, J.W. New Drosophila transgenic reporters: insulated P-element vectors expressing fast-maturing RFP Biotechniques. 2004; 36 :436-440, 442 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) that did not require antibody staining.
Expression patterns of mex1-Gal4, myo1A-Gal4 and elav-Gal4 in the gut and the nervous system were visualized with nls-mCherry ( Caussinus et al., 2008 43. Caussinus, E. ∙ Colombelli, J. ∙ Affolter, M. Tip-cell migration controls stalk-cell intercalation during Drosophila tracheal tube elongation Curr. Biol. 2008; 18 :1727-1734 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ) (stained with anti-dsRed antibodies that recognize mCherry). We used nls-mCherry here because expression of RedStinger or nls-GFP in the whole nervous system seemed to be toxic to the flies, and we wanted the same marker in the gut and the brain for direct comparison.
In situ ROS detection was performed using either dihydroethidium (DHE) (Sigma-Aldrich) or 2′,7’-dichlorofluorescein (H2DCF) (Sigma-Aldrich) following previously described protocols ( Owusu-Ansah et al., 2008; Rera et al., 2011 170. Owusu-Ansah, E. ∙ Yavari, A. ∙ Banerjee, U. A protocol for in vivo detection of reactive oxygen species Protocol Exchange. 2008; Crossref Google Scholar 189. Rera, M. ∙ Bahadorani, S. ∙ Cho, J. ... Modulation of longevity and tissue homeostasis by the Drosophila PGC-1 homolog Cell Metab. 2011; 14 :623-634 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). For DHE staining, flies were anesthetized on ice and dissected in Schneider’s insect medium (GIBCO). Whole tissues were then incubated on a shaker at room temperature with 60 μM DHE for 7 minutes in the dark. Before mounting, samples were washed three times for 5 minutes in Schneider’s medium and once in PBS for 5 minutes, using a shaker at room temperature. For H2DCF, flies were anesthetized using CO 2 and dissected in PBS. Tissues were then incubated on a shaker at room temperature with 10 μM H2DCF for 15 minutes in the dark. Before mounting, samples were washed three times for 5 minutes each in PBS using a shaker at room temperature.
Samples from each independent experiment were mounted between glass slides and coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using Vectashield Antifade Mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and immediately imaged with identical settings on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (as described below).
Lysosomal foci were detected using LysoTracker (Invitrogen) following a protocol from Ulgherait et al. (2014) 231. Ulgherait, M. ∙ Rana, A. ∙ Rera, M. ... AMPK modulates tissue and organismal aging in a non-cell-autonomous manner Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :1767-1780 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar . Flies were anesthetized on ice and dissected in cold PBS. Tissues were then incubated for 1.5 minutes, protected from light, in 1 μM LysoTracker Red at room temperature on a shaker. Before mounting, five 30-s washes in PBS were performed at room temperature on a shaker. Samples were mounted between glass slides and coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using Vectashield Antifade Mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and imaged immediately with the same intensity settings on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (as described below).
Necrosis was detected with SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) following a protocol from Lee et al. (2016) 135. Lee, K.Z. ∙ Lestradet, M. ∙ Socha, C. ... Enterocyte Purge and Rapid Recovery Is a Resilience Reaction of the Gut Epithelium to Pore-Forming Toxin Attack Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20 :716-730 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar . Flies were anesthetized on ice and dissected in cold PBS. Guts were incubated in 1 μM final concentration of SYTOX Green and 4% PFA for 40 minutes at room temperature on a shaker. Tissues were then washed three times for 20 minutes with PBS at room temperature on a shaker, and mounted between glass slides and coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using Vectashield Antifade Mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Samples were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (as described below).
Images were acquired with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. A minimum of 7 samples per genotype was scored for each experiment and at least 2 independent experiments were performed. Laser, filter and gain settings remained constant within each independent experiment. Channels were scanned sequentially using these objectives: 10x for DHE (ROS) imaging and the expression pattern of mex1-Gal4, elav-Gal4 and myo1A-Gal4 in the whole fly gut (nls-mCherry; Figures 7 C and S7 A); 20x oil for all other expression patterns, γH2Av, cleaved caspase-3 and SYTOX Green imaging; 40x oil for FMR1 and LysoTracker imaging. Confocal Z stacks were analyzed using Fiji, maximum projections are shown.
Image quantification was performed using Fiji. For quantification of total ROS levels, pixel intensities of Z stacks (sum slices) were used. The mean of the summed DHE or H2DCF intensities averaged from each tissue was used for statistical analysis. For quantification of immunostainings, pixel intensities of Z stacks (sum slices) were used. The mean of the summed pixel intensities averaged from each tissue and normalized to the area of selection was used for statistical analysis.
For continuous sleep deprivation, mice were placed into a restriction chamber (Pinnacle Technology 9000-K-S) in which a rotating bar, placed at short distance above the cage floor, is kept under constant but gentle motion to limit sleep. The bar was programed to move at speed 7 and to alternate between clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations. Age-matched control non-deprived mice were placed into a similar-sized chamber but without the bar rotating. Control and sleep-restricted mice were housed on autoclaved corncob bedding (8B Bed-o’Cobs 1/8” 1.25 cu ft, Scott Pharma Inc% # 4B) where they had ad libitum access to food (Pico Lab Rodent Diet 20 # 5053) and water. For each condition (control and sleep deprived), 5 males were placed in each cage 48 hours before the beginning of the sleep deprivation protocol to allow for acclimation. For each independent experiment, one mouse was taken out from each cage after 1, 2, and 5 days of sleep deprivation for dissections. At least 2 independent experiments were performed for each mouse strain and for each tissue analyzed. Mouse weights were recorded over the deprivation period. Each day, the same amount of food was provided to the sleep-restricted and non-restricted groups.
To monitor sleep, a single male was placed in a restriction chamber (Pinnacle Technology 9000-K-S) equipped with a 3-channel tethered EEG/EMG system (Pinnacle Technologies 8200-K1-iSL). Head-mounted preamplifiers (Pinnacle Technologies 8201) were implanted surgically. For electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG), mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and mounted onto a stereotactic apparatus (Kopf) for surgery. The head was shaved, a 1.5 cm rostral-caudal incision was made starting from approximately 3.5 mm anterior of bregma, and the EEG/EMG headmount was adhered onto the surface of the dry skull with Loctite 404 Instant Adhesive (Fisher Scientific #NC0619400). Screws (Pinnacle Technologies 8209, 8212) were drilled into the skull at the corresponding holes in the headmount for hippocampal and cortical EEG recordings. To insert the EMG wires, small pockets in the nuchal muscles were made. C&B Metabond Adhesive Luting Cement (Parkell) was applied to the headmount to protect and insulate EEG/EMG leads. The skin around the headmount was sutured and mice were allowed to recover for at least a week. Implanted mice were tethered to the 3-channel EEG/EMG system in the restriction chamber and allowed to acclimate for 2 days before recording. Recordings were acquired in standard conditions for 48 hours with no rotation of the bar, followed by 48 hours with the bar rotating (and then by 24 hours with no rotation of the bar for rebound experiments).
Sleep recordings were scored in 10-s epochs over 48 hours of normal sleep and sleep restriction, with the sleep analysis software Sirenia Sleep Pro. Analysis was semi-automated using both threshold scoring and cluster scoring. Non-REM EEG epochs were scored as low frequency (0.5-4 Hz range), high amplitude (+/− 150-250 μV) delta waves with low-amplitude EMG waves. REM EEG epochs contained mixed frequencies with predominantly theta waves (6-9 Hz range), low amplitude (+/− 50-100 μV) and flat EMG waves. Wake epochs were scored as high frequency (8-50 Hz), low amplitude (+/− 50-100 μV) EEG waves with high-amplitude EMG. Automated scored epochs were visually inspected to ensure that each epoch was scored according to our definitions of wake, non-REM, and REM, and epochs that were not scored by the set rules were manually scored. Epochs that contained movement artifacts were removed.
Sleep rebound was measured after 2 consecutive days of sleep deprivation. Rebound sleep was calculated by subtracting the amount of sleep (REM or NREM) on the day before deprivation from the amount of sleep on the day following deprivation.
Control and sleep-deprived mice were sacrificed at 1, 2, or 5 days after the onset of sleep restriction. Tissues (small intestine, quadriceps muscle, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, large intestine, spleen, pancreas) were collected and placed in room temperature PBS before embedding in O.C.T (Tissue-Tek). Embedded tissues were immediately placed on dry ice and sectioned on a Leica cryostat within 6 hours post-dissection. 30 μm sections were mounted on microscope glass slides (VWR) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C with 10 μM DHE (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were washed three times for 5 minutes each with PBS before mounting. Sections from each independent experiment were mounted between glass microscope slides and coverslips (VWR) with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech), and imaged immediately with identical settings on a Leica SP8 confocal, or Olympus VS120 slide scanner (brain sections only).
Control and sleep-deprived mice were sacrificed 2 or 5 days after the onset of sleep restriction. Mice were perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% PFA. The small and large intestines were dissected, post-fixed for 24 hours in 4% PFA followed by 20% sucrose for cryoprotection, and embedded in O.C.T (Tissue-Tek). Embedded tissues were placed at −80°C until sectioning. 30 μm tissue sections were obtained using a Leica cryostat and mounted on a microscope glass slide (VWR). Sections were permeabilized for 30 minutes in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated for 2 hours in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 + 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs). Samples were then immunostained for 48 hours with primary antibodies at 4°C in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 + 5% normal goat serum. Three 20-minute washes were performed with PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 before incubation with secondary antibodies for 2 hours in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 + 5% normal goat serum at room temperature. Three final 20-minute washes were performed with PBS/0.2% Triton X-100, after which samples were mounted between glass microscope slides and coverslips (VWR) with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech), and imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (as described below).
Primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-γH2Ax (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-TIA1 (1:300, Santa Cruz). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, 1:500).
Samples were visualized and images acquired with either a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (all tissues except the brain for DHE, and all immunostainings) or an Olympus VS120 slide scanner (brain sections only). A minimum of 12 samples per tissue was scored for each independent experiment and at least 2 independent experiments were performed for each tissue. Laser, filter and gain settings remained constant within each independent experiment, and channels were scanned sequentially using a 10x objective. Confocal Z stacks and whole slide scanner images were analyzed using Fiji.
For quantification of total ROS levels, pixel intensities of Z stacks (sum slices) were used for all tissues except the brain (see below). The mean of the summed DHE intensities from each sample was used for statistical analysis.
For ROS measurement in the brain, whole slide scanning was used and quantification was performed using pixel intensities of the fluorescent signal. The mean DHE intensity from each sample was used for statistical analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism software 7 (GraphPad Software Inc.), except for bootstrap analysis of median survival (adjusted for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni’s method) that was done using a custom MATLAB software program. Data are presented as mean and SEM unless indicated otherwise. Please see Table S1 for detailed statistical analysis of each figure, including sample sizes and tests used.
