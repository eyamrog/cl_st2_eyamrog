Title: Extracellular hyaluronate pressure shaped by cellular tethers drives tissue morphogenesis


Abstract: Summary

How tissues acquire complex shapes is a fundamental question in biology and regenerative medicine. Zebrafish semicircular canals form from invaginations in the otic epithelium (buds) that extend and fuse to form the hubs of each canal. We find that conventional actomyosin-driven behaviors are not required. Instead, local secretion of hyaluronan, made by the enzymes uridine 5′-diphosphate dehydrogenase ( ugdh ) and hyaluronan synthase 3 ( has3 ), drives canal morphogenesis. Charged hyaluronate polymers osmotically swell with water and generate isotropic extracellular pressure to deform the overlying epithelium into buds. The mechanical anisotropy needed to shape buds into tubes is conferred by a polarized distribution of actomyosin and E-cadherin-rich membrane tethers, which we term cytocinches. Most work on tissue morphogenesis ascribes actomyosin contractility as the driving force, while the extracellular matrix shapes tissues through differential stiffness. Our work inverts this expectation. Hyaluronate pressure shaped by anisotropic tissue stiffness may be a widespread mechanism for powering morphological change in organogenesis and tissue engineering.

Section: Introduction

Most organs, including kidney, vasculature, lung, gut, and heart, begin as simple epithelia that then undergo morphogenesis to create elaborate shapes necessary for their function ( Lubarsky and Krasnow, 2003 49. Lubarsky, B. ∙ Krasnow, M.A. Tube morphogenesis: making and shaping biological tubes Cell. 2003; 112 :19-28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (558) PubMed Google Scholar ). How this occurs is a fundamental question in biology with important implications in disease and regenerative medicine. Most research across tissues and species impute actomyosin networks as the central producers of mechanical forces that power cell deformations during tissue morphogenesis ( Heisenberg and Bellaïche, 2013 37. Heisenberg, C.P. ∙ Bellaïche, Y. Forces in tissue morphogenesis and patterning Cell. 2013; 153 :948-962 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (822) PubMed Google Scholar ; Munjal and Lecuit, 2014 52. Munjal, A. ∙ Lecuit, T. Actomyosin networks and tissue morphogenesis Development. 2014; 141 :1789-1793 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Actomyosin networks generate active contractile tension through the pulling of actin filaments (F-actin) by non-muscle myosin II motor proteins (myosin II) using ATP hydrolysis ( Hartman and Spudich, 2012 36. Hartman, M.A. ∙ Spudich, J.A. The myosin superfamily at a glance J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 :1627-1632 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). The F-actin cortex is anchored to the plasma membrane and transmits forces across the tissue through cell adhesion (e.g., cadherins and integrins) ( Lecuit et al., 2011 46. Lecuit, T. ∙ Lenne, P.-F. ∙ Munro, E. Force generation, transmission, and integration during cell and tissue morphogenesis Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27 :157-184 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this paradigm, developmental signals and biochemical information pattern tissue dynamics by locally activating actomyosin contractility and/or modulating cell adhesion to drive cellular morphogenesis. Classic examples include apical constriction during the invagination of the presumptive mesoderm ( Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005 22. Dawes-Hoang, R.E. ∙ Parmar, K.M. ∙ Christiansen, A.E. ... folded gastrulation, cell shape change and the control of myosin localization Development. 2005; 132 :4165-4178 Crossref Scopus (321) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the planar polarization of cell-cell junction strength to control cell arrangements during convergence extension ( Bertet et al., 2004 5. Bertet, C. ∙ Sulak, L. ∙ Lecuit, T. Myosin-dependent junction remodelling controls planar cell intercalation and axis elongation Nature. 2004; 429 :667-671 Crossref Scopus (743) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The extracellular matrix (ECM), which is attached to most tissues, has long been recognized as an important determinant of tissue mechanics by integrating tissue forces and by providing stiffness. The ECM gets its stiffness from fibrous protein polymer networks such as fibronectins, laminins, and collagens. In this regime, the key mechanical aspect of the ECM is its elasticity and its ability to transmit tensile force across cells in an epithelium. During tissue morphogenesis, the ECM can create anisotropic shapes by resisting isotropic forces through differential stiffness ( Dzamba and DeSimone, 2018 25. Dzamba, B.J. ∙ DeSimone, D.W. Chapter Seven - Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and the Sculpting of Embryonic Tissues Academic Press, Litscher, E.S. ∙ Wassarman, P.M. (Editors) in: Current Topics in Developmental Biology. 2018; 245-274 Google Scholar ). For instance, the circumferentially aligned collagen fibers in the ECM of the Drosophila egg constrain isotropic tissue growth to facilitate elongation in the anterior-posterior axis ( Crest et al., 2017 20. Crest, J. ∙ Diz-Muñoz, A. ∙ Chen, D.-Y. ... Organ sculpting by patterned extracellular matrix stiffness eLife. 2017; 6 :e24958 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ability of collagen fibers to assemble into gels with high tensile strength, especially after cross-linking, is key to the regime where the ECM plays a passive, elastic role in morphogenesis ( Chaudhuri et al., 2020 14. Chaudhuri, O. ∙ Cooper-White, J. ∙ Janmey, P.A. ... Effects of extracellular matrix viscoelasticity on cellular behaviour Nature. 2020; 584 :535-546 Crossref Scopus (1085) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is another widespread ECM component, but its physical properties differ greatly from collagens, fibronectin, and laminins. HA is a long, flexible polysaccharide with a high density of carboxylate groups that are mostly negatively charged and balanced by sodium ions under physiological conditions. As a result of this chemistry, HA polymers tend to swell with water and form viscoelastic hydrogels with a low mass fraction and a low tensile strength but a high propensity to generate compressive osmotic forces by swelling ( Cowman et al., 2015 19. Cowman, M.K. ∙ Schmidt, T.A. ∙ Raghavan, P. ... Viscoelastic Properties of Hyaluronan in Physiological Conditions F1000Res. 2015; 4 :622 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ; Toole, 1981 78. Toole, B.P. Glycosaminoglycans in Morphogenesis Springer, Hay, E.D. (Editor) in: Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 1981; 259-294 Google Scholar ). Despite its abundance, the role of HA in tissue morphogenesis due to its biophysical properties has not been fully investigated. Rather, the biophysical HA literature is dominated by medical applications such as cosmetic surgery as a dermal filler, drug delivery, and joint lubrication ( Borzacchiello et al., 2015 6. Borzacchiello, A. ∙ Russo, L. ∙ Malle, B.M. ... Hyaluronic Acid Based Hydrogels for Regenerative Medicine Applications BioMed Res. Int. 2015; 2015 :871218 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We investigated how morphogenic forces are generated to deform a simple epithelium in an understudied yet exemplary system common to all vertebrate organisms: semicircular canal (SCC) development ( Higuchi et al., 2019 38. Higuchi, S. ∙ Sugahara, F. ∙ Pascual-Anaya, J. ... Inner ear development in cyclostomes and evolution of the vertebrate semicircular canals Nature. 2019; 565 :347-350 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). All jawed vertebrates have three mutually orthogonal SCCs in each inner ear whose well-conserved shape is required for their function of sensing balance and acceleration ( Groves and Fekete, 2012 32. Groves, A.K. ∙ Fekete, D.M. Shaping sound in space: the regulation of inner ear patterning Development. 2012; 139 :245-257 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B). Head movement results in fluid movement in the canals, which is transduced by the hair cells to sense motion. Morphogenesis of the SCCs is among the most geometrically complex and precise events in vertebrate development ( Figure 1 A). The vertebrate inner ear forms from a thickening of the embryonic ectoderm located lateral to the hindbrain, called the otic placode ( Whitfield, 2015 88. Whitfield, T.T. Development of the inner ear Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2015; 32 :112-118 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). The otic placode cavitates or invaginates to form a tight epithelial fluid-filled structure called the otic vesicle (OV) ( Whitfield, 2015 88. Whitfield, T.T. Development of the inner ear Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2015; 32 :112-118 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). The single-layered OV then undergoes a dramatic topological change to form the SCCs ( Alsina and Whitfield, 2017 1. Alsina, B. ∙ Whitfield, T.T. Sculpting the labyrinth: Morphogenesis of the developing inner ear Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 65 :47-59 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A). The mechanisms underlying SCC morphogenesis remain poorly understood due to their inaccessibility in most model organisms. Zebrafish lack middle and outer ears, and the inner ear forms before the ossification of the skull, which encases the inner ear, making it both optically and physically accessible and thereby an excellent model organism to study SCC morphogenesis.
Using in toto imaging of transparent zebrafish embryos, perturbation approaches, and biophysical modeling, we discovered unexpected roles of the ECM and actomyosin networks in SCC morphogenesis. Patterned cells in the otic epithelium locally generate extracellular HA, which in turn actively reshapes the tissue through osmotic swelling. Thus, the driving force is ultimately ECM-derived osmotic pressure rather than actomyosin contractility. Actomyosin networks instead play a role in directing anisotropic morphogenesis through differential tissue stiffness provided by E-cadherin-linked intercellular tethers we term cytocinches.

Section: Results

All prior studies on SCC development have been done with either low-resolution live microscopy or static imaging by fluorescence, paint fills, or micro-computed tomography (CT) images ( Chang et al., 2004 11.

Whitfield, T.T. ∙ Granato, M. ∙ van Eeden, F.J. ... Mutations affecting development of the zebrafish inner ear and lateral line Development. 1996; 123 :241-254 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To perform long-term imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution of zebrafish SCC development, we took advantage of transgenic zebrafish expressing a bright membrane-localized fluorescent protein ( Swinburne et al., 2018 73. Swinburne, I.A. ∙ Mosaliganti, K.R. ∙ Upadhyayula, S. ... Lamellar projections in the endolymphatic sac act as a relief valve to regulate inner ear pressure eLife. 2018; 7 :e37131 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Embryos were mounted dorso-laterally. as shown in Figure 1 C, in a cast agarose mount that secures the head and the yolk and positions the ear just beneath the coverslip.
SCCs form from the topological remodeling of the OV sandwiched between the skin and the hindbrain and surrounded by mesenchymal cells ( Figures 1 D and S1 A; Video S1 ). Morphogenesis initiates when cells from six different regions of the otic epithelium sequentially form buds projecting into the lumen ( Figures 1 E, 1F, 1I, 1J, and S1 A–S1C; Video S1 ). Cells in lateral (antero-lateral and postero-lateral) and anterior regions form buds first (45 h post fertilization [hpf]), followed by cells in the posterior region (51 hpf), and lastly in the ventro-lateral and the ventral regions (63 hpf) ( Figures 1 E, 1F, 1I, 1J, and S1 A–S1C; Video S1 ). The six buds extend anisotropically in their longitudinal axis ( Figures 1 F–1J and S1 B–S1F; Video S1 ). Topology change occurs when the buds fuse to one another to form three pillars through the OV lumen demarcating the hubs of the future anterior, posterior, and lateral SCCs ( Figures 1 I–1K; Video S1 ).

To investigate the mechanisms underlying SCC development, we tested existing models for morphogenesis, including elevated proliferation of bud cells compared to the neighboring cells ( Figure 2 K). A localized increase of cell proliferation has been observed in nascent epithelial buds during branching morphogenesis in a number of organs including kidney, salivary gland, and lung ( Varner and Nelson, 2014 82. Varner, V.D. ∙ Nelson, C.M. Cellular and physical mechanisms of branching morphogenesis Development. 2014; 141 :2750-2759 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using a proliferative marker, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, we found a low rate of proliferation during SCC morphogenesis (45–54 hpf) with 25% of cells in the lateral region of the OV and less than 10% of the bud forming cells in S phase ( Figures 2 A and 2C). Inhibiting S phase with hydroxyurea and aphidicolin between 48–54 hpf reduced EdU incorporation down to 10% in the lateral OV and to 0% in bud cells, yet their morphogenesis continued normally with a slight delay ( Figures 2 B–2D). We conclude that localized cell proliferation is not responsible budding.
We next investigated whether cell-rearrangement-based convergence extension drives otic epithelial bud extension ( Figure 2 K). Convergence extension is a widely employed mechanism for tissue elongation during embryonic development ( Wallingford et al., 2002 84. Wallingford, J.B. ∙ Fraser, S.E. ∙ Harland, R.M. Convergent extension: the molecular control of polarized cell movement during embryonic development Dev. Cell. 2002; 2 :695-706 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ). During Drosophila salivary gland morphogenesis, cells exhibit circumferential convergence and radial extension to form a narrow tube from a round and flat epithelium ( Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018 67. Sanchez-Corrales, Y.E. ∙ Blanchard, G.B. ∙ Röper, K. Radially patterned cell behaviours during tube budding from an epithelium eLife. 2018; 7 :e35717 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the geometrical similarity, we tested this model in the otic epithelium by tracking cells in the morphogenic regions. We observed that as buds extend, cells adjacent to the bud become part of the bud ( Figure 2 E). However, both the cells adjacent to and within the bud maintain their neighbors during bud extension, thereby refuting a cell-rearrangement-based model for budding morphogenesis ( Figures 2 E and 2F).
We next examined tissue-scale mechanisms such as buckling in SCC morphogenesis ( Figure 2 K). Compressive stresses from the differential growth of apposed tissues can cause tissues to buckle or fold ( Nelson, 2016 54. Nelson, C.M. On Buckling Morphogenesis J. Biomech. Eng. 2016; 138 :021005 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Examples include villi formation in the small intestine ( Shyer et al., 2013 69. Shyer, A.E. ∙ Tallinen, T. ∙ Nerurkar, N.L. ... Villification: how the gut gets its villi Science. 2013; 342 :212-218 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ) and branching in the airways of the lung ( Nelson, 2016 54. Nelson, C.M. On Buckling Morphogenesis J. Biomech. Eng. 2016; 138 :021005 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Besides tissue growth, osmotic pressure from interstitial and lumenal fluids can also apply stresses on the surrounding epithelium ( Chan et al., 2019 10. Chan, C.J. ∙ Costanzo, M. ∙ Ruiz-Herrero, T. ... Hydraulic control of mammalian embryo size and cell fate Nature. 2019; 571 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Navis and Bagnat, 2015 53. Navis, A. ∙ Bagnat, M. Developing pressures: fluid forces driving morphogenesis Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2015; 32 :24-30 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), including in the OV ( Mosaliganti et al., 2019 51. Mosaliganti, K.R. ∙ Swinburne, I.A. ∙ Chan, C.U. ... Size control of the inner ear via hydraulic feedback eLife. 2019; 8 :e39596 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). As reported above, cell proliferation is low during SCC morphogenesis and blocking it does not affect bud extension ( Figures 2 A–2D). To reduce lumen pressure, we used a laser-mediated, targeted ablation of single cells in the OV to disrupt the epithelial barrier causing loss of lumen volume and pressure ( Mosaliganti et al., 2019 51. Mosaliganti, K.R. ∙ Swinburne, I.A. ∙ Chan, C.U. ... Size control of the inner ear via hydraulic feedback eLife. 2019; 8 :e39596 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 G and 2I). Ablation-mediated loss of lumen pressure neither affected the initiation of new buds nor the extension of existing buds ( Figures 2 H and 2J). Together, these data are inconsistent with a buckling-based model for morphogenesis ( Figure 2 K). Interestingly, the ablation of one or two bud cells was sufficient to block extension of that bud, while the adjacent non-ablated buds continued morphogenesis normally ( Figures 2 G–2J), showing that morphogenesis of each bud is locally initiated.
We next examined a role for the ECM in the local initiation of each bud ( Figure 2 K). In mouse gut explants, mesenchymal condensates have been shown to align the surrounding collagen I fibers causing the overlying epithelium to bend ( Hughes et al., 2018 39. Hughes, A.J. ∙ Miyazaki, H. ∙ Coyle, M.C. ... Engineered Tissue Folding by Mechanical Compaction of the Mesenchyme Dev. Cell. 2018; 44 :165-178.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the frog inner ear, HA was shown to be required for SCC formation ( Haddon and Lewis, 1991 34. Haddon, C.M. ∙ Lewis, J.H. Hyaluronan as a propellant for epithelial movement: the development of semicircular canals in the inner ear of Xenopus Development. 1991; 112 :541-550 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, which cells are responsible for HA production and how HA generates morphological change during SCC formation remain unclear. HA is a secreted, unbranched, and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating disaccharide subunits. HA is synthesized by the enzymes uridine 5′-diphosphate dehydrogenase ( ugdh), which participates in subunit synthesis, and hyaluronan synthase ( has ), which polymerizes subunits at the cell membrane to extrude out chains directly into the extracellular space ( Vigetti et al., 2014 83. Vigetti, D. ∙ Karousou, E. ∙ Viola, M. ... Hyaluronan: biosynthesis and signaling Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1840 :2452-2459 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is similar to how plants spin out their cell wall using cellulose synthases present on the membrane ( Keegstra, 2010 42. Keegstra, K. Plant cell walls Plant Physiol. 2010; 154 :483-486 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, unlike HA, cellulose-based plant cell walls are extremely stiff and do not swell.
We investigated whether HA synthesis enzymes are expressed by the mesenchymal cells that surround the OV or by the cells of the otic epithelium using multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Choi et al., 2018 17. Choi, H.M.T. ∙ Schwarzkopf, M. ∙ Fornace, M.E. ... Third-generation in situ hybridization chain reaction: multiplexed, quantitative, sensitive, versatile, robust Development. 2018; 145 :dev165753 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed local and uniform expression of ugdh and has3 in the bud cells of the OV, except the cells at the corner of the bud that have a slightly lower expression ( Figures 3 A–3C, S2 A, and S2B). In contrast, collagen 2 ( col2a1a ), a major component of the ECM, is not exclusive to the buds and is instead expressed in all the cells of the OV ( Figures 3 A–3C and S2 C), while has2, known for its role in cardiac morphogenesis ( Patra et al., 2011 61. Patra, C. ∙ Diehl, F. ∙ Ferrazzi, F. ... Nephronectin regulates atrioventricular canal differentiation via Bmp4-Has2 signaling in zebrafish Development. 2011; 138 :4499-4509 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), is not expressed in the OV ( Thisse and Thisse, 2005 75. Thisse, C. ∙ Thisse, B. High throughput expression analysis of ZF-models consortium clones. ZFIN 2005 https://zfin.org/ZDB-PUB-051025-1 Google Scholar ). Moreover, in contrast to col2a1a, ugdh and has3 expression were not observed after the buds fused ( Figures S2 A–S2C). We conclude that ugdh and has3 are locally, uniformly, and transiently expressed in the bud cells of the OV during morphogenesis.
We next tested the function of these enzymes in SCC morphogenesis. A point mutation that disrupts ugdh ( Driever et al., 1996 23. Driever, W. ∙ Solnica-Krezel, L. ∙ Schier, A.F. ... A genetic screen for mutations affecting embryogenesis in zebrafish Development. 1996; 123 :37-46 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Neuhauss et al., 1996 55. Neuhauss, S.C.F. ∙ Solnica-Krezel, L. ∙ Schier, A.F. ... Mutations affecting craniofacial development in zebrafish Development. 1996; 123 :357-367 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Walsh and Stainier, 2001 85. Walsh, E.C. ∙ Stainier, D.Y.R. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase required for cardiac valve formation in zebrafish Science. 2001; 293 :1670-1673 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ) blocked OV budding at 54 hpf ( Figures 3 D and 3F) and caused aberrant bud morphologies at 72 hpf ( Figure S2 H). Morpholino-mediated knockdown of has3 ( Ouyang et al., 2017 59. Ouyang, X. ∙ Panetta, N.J. ∙ Talbott, M.D. ... Hyaluronic acid synthesis is required for zebrafish tail fin regeneration PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0171898 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2 D–S2G) also abrogated SCC formation with no budding at 54 hpf ( Figures 3 E and 3F) and aberrant bud morphologies at 72 hpf ( Figures S2 I and S2J). We conclude that ugdh and has3 are required for zebrafish SCC formation. The requirement of HA for SCC development is potentially conserved across species, as specific expression of has2 is observed in the SCCs during mouse development ( Tien and Spicer, 2005 77. Tien, J.Y.L. ∙ Spicer, A.P. Three vertebrate hyaluronan synthases are expressed during mouse development in distinct spatial and temporal patterns Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233 :130-141 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We examined the localization of endogenous HA using a HA-binding protein (HABP) ( Kohda et al., 1996 43. Kohda, D. ∙ Morton, C.J. ∙ Parkar, A.A. ... Solution structure of the link module: a hyaluronan-binding domain involved in extracellular matrix stability and cell migration Cell. 1996; 86 :767-775 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). During bud formation, the HABP is restricted to and fills up the extracellular space beneath the buds (hereafter referred to as the bud-ECM) ( Figures 4 A–4C, 4E, and S3 B). In contrast, collagen 2 was detected in the ECM surrounding the entire OV with a slightly higher expression in the bud-ECM ( Figures 4 A–4C, 4E, and S3 B). Interestingly, the basement membrane (BM) component, laminin, was present in the entire OV prior to budding ( Figure S3 A) and was subsequently depleted from the BM of the budding cells during morphogenesis, except for the cells at the corner of the bud ( Figure S3 A) (which are also the cells that express lower HA synthesizing enzymes; Figure 3 C). These immunostainings suggest that HA-producing bud cells detach from the BM, while the cells at the boundary of the bud remain attached.
We next perturbed HA by injecting hyaluronidase (HAase), an enzyme that breaks down HA polymers, in the space surrounding the OV (periotic space). HAase treatment inhibited HA accumulation in the bud-ECM ( Figures 4 D and S3 C), showing that the local accumulation of HA depends on its polymeric properties. To probe the physical properties of HA, we measured the percolation of different sizes of fluorescent dextran (molecular weights 3 kDa, 10 kDa, and 70 kDa, and approximate Stokes radii 1.3, 2.4, and 5 nm, respectively [ Granath, 1958 31. Granath, K.A. Solution properties of branched dextrans J. Colloid Sci. 1958; 13 :308-328 Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar ]) into the bud-ECM when injected in the periotic space surrounding the OV ( Figures S3 D and 4 F–4H). Fluorescent-labeled alpha-Bungarotoxin (aBt) was co-injected with dextran as a control. After 2 h, aBt equilibrated in the bud-ECM relative to the periotic space, while 85% of 3 kDa, 65% of 10 kDa, and only 30% of 70 kDa dextran percolated in the bud-ECM ( Figures 4 F–4I). The low percolation of large dextrans shows that the HA-rich bud-ECM is dense with a pore size in the range of at most a few tens of nanometer. We find the intensity of HABP and the percolation of dyes to be uniform within the bud-ECM, suggesting a uniform distribution and structure of the HA-rich bud-ECM ( Figures S3 D and 4 J) consistent with the long flexible structure of HA.
We investigated the mechanical basis of HA-dependent morphogenesis. In physiological conditions, HA is made as long charged polymers (0.5–6 MDa) ( Cyphert et al., 2015 21. Cyphert, J.M. ∙ Trempus, C.S. ∙ Garantziotis, S. Size Matters: Molecular Weight Specificity of Hyaluronan Effects in Cell Biology Int. J. Cell Biol. 2015; 2015 :563818 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ), behaving as a polyelectrolyte, which imbibes and retains large amounts of water to a form a viscoelastic solution ( Cowman et al., 2015 19. Cowman, M.K. ∙ Schmidt, T.A. ∙ Raghavan, P. ... Viscoelastic Properties of Hyaluronan in Physiological Conditions F1000Res. 2015; 4 :622 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). We distinguished between two hypotheses. First, a propellant model, where HA pushes the overlying epithelium to form buds through localized secretion (as suggested in frog SCC morphogenesis [ Haddon and Lewis, 1991 34. Haddon, C.M. ∙ Lewis, J.H. Hyaluronan as a propellant for epithelial movement: the development of semicircular canals in the inner ear of Xenopus Development. 1991; 112 :541-550 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ]). Interestingly, this model is similar to how most raphid diatoms glide over surfaces through polysaccharide-rich mucilage strand secretion ( Chen et al., 2019 16. Chen, L. ∙ Weng, D. ∙ Du, C. ... Contribution of frustules and mucilage trails to the mobility of diatom Navicula sp Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :7342 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Key evidence against the propellent model is the uniform expression of HA synthesis genes, has3 and ugdh, rather than just at the tip ( Figure 3 C).
The second hypothesis is a pressure model, where HA actively applies stresses on the surrounding tissues due to osmotic swelling ( Li et al., 2020 47. Li, Y. ∙ Konstantopoulos, K. ∙ Zhao, R. ... The importance of water and hydraulic pressure in cell dynamics J. Cell Sci. 2020; 133 :jcs240341 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Toole, 1981 78. Toole, B.P. Glycosaminoglycans in Morphogenesis Springer, Hay, E.D. (Editor) in: Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 1981; 259-294 Google Scholar ). As the buds form and extend, the volume of the bud-ECM increases ( Figures 5 A and 5C). The inhibition of HA with HAase treatment led to a significant reduction of bud-ECM volume ( Figures 5 B and 5D) and, in agreement with previous results ( Geng et al., 2013 29. Geng, F.-S. ∙ Abbas, L. ∙ Baxendale, S. ... Semicircular canal morphogenesis in the zebrafish inner ear requires the function of gpr126 (lauscher), an adhesion class G protein-coupled receptor gene Development. 2013; 140 :4362-4374 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), arrested bud extension ( Figures 5 B and 5E). We examined whether the osmotic swelling of the HA confined in the bud-ECM applies hydrostatic pressure on the overlying bud cells, causing cell strain ( Figure 5 F). Consistent with our hypothesis, during bud extension, the HA-producing bud cells thin in the radial axis and stretch in the circumferential and longitudinal axes, while maintaining their volume ( Figures 5 C, 5G, and 5H; Video S2 ). Strikingly, HAase treatment causes the loss of cell stretching in the buds ( Figures 5 G and 5I). These data are consistent with a hyaluronate pressure-based model for powering cell stretching and epithelial budding.

Anisotropic bud and cell morphologies during bud extension, related to Figure 5 Side and transverse views of 3D rendered time-lapse images of an anterior bud using Tg( β Actin:membrane-mCherry ) embryo. Longitudinal (blue), circumferential (orange) and radial (white) axes are labeled at 5 hpb. Scale bar, 10 μm.
We next investigated how buds can grow anisotropically in the longitudinal axis. A time-lapse observation showed that cell stretching is greater in the longitudinal than the circumferential axis ( Figure 5 H; Video S2 ). Similarly, buds first have an isotropic aspect ratio (1:1, longitudinal: circumferential radius) between 1–3 h post budding (hpb) and then extend only in the longitudinal axis to acquire an anisotropic aspect ratio (2.5:1) ( Figure 5 K; Video S2 ). We considered whether anisotropic bud extension could be mediated by HA. Pascal’s law states that pressure is spatially uniform within a static fluid. For HA to exert anisotropic stresses on the overlying epithelium, either pressure would need to be non-equilibrated at these time scales or HA would need to form a stiff gel rather than a fluid. However, HA forms a viscoelastic solution in vitro ( Cowman et al., 2015 19. Cowman, M.K. ∙ Schmidt, T.A. ∙ Raghavan, P. ... Viscoelastic Properties of Hyaluronan in Physiological Conditions F1000Res. 2015; 4 :622 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ), and pressure equilibration in viscoelastic gels with similar pore sizes ( Figures 4 F–4I) has been shown to be on timescales ∼10 s across length-scales 15–30 μm ( Charras et al., 2005 13. Charras, G.T. ∙ Yarrow, J.C. ∙ Horton, M.A. ... Non-equilibration of hydrostatic pressure in blebbing cells Nature. 2005; 435 :365-369 Crossref Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ). The bud-ECM size is comparable ( Figure 5 K), and the morphogenic deformations are much slower (30 mins to a few hours; Figures S1 F and 5 K), strongly suggesting uniform isotropic pressure in the bud-ECM. In addition, the intensity of HABP and the percolation of dyes is uniform within the bud-ECM, suggesting isotropic structural properties of the matrix ( Figure 4 J). Taken together, these data support an active pressure-based model whereby HA drives morphogenesis through osmotic swelling, but that HA alone cannot be responsible for the anisotropy of bud extension.
We examined whether the bud epithelium itself provides the anisotropic stiffness needed to shape the isotropic hyaluronate pressure. Epithelial cells can alter their stiffness by increasing actomyosin network assembly to generate high internal tension ( Lecuit et al., 2011 46. Lecuit, T. ∙ Lenne, P.-F. ∙ Munro, E.

Tee, S.-Y. ∙ Bausch, A.R. ∙ Janmey, P.A. The mechanical cell Curr. Biol. 2009; 19 :R745-R748 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using live reporters, we found that during bud extension, both F-actin and myosin II accumulate on the lateral and basal (ECM-facing) cell surfaces relative to the apical surface (OV lumen-facing) ( Figures S4 A–S4D; Video S3 ). Remarkably, using high-resolution imaging and as confirmed by mosaic membrane labeling, we observe actomyosin-rich protrusive membrane tethers extending tangentially at the basal surface ( Figures 6 A–6C and S4 E; Video S4 ). While protrusive activity is commonly observed in migratory epithelia, protrusions in non-migratory epithelia have also been reported. Examples include cytonemes involved in chemical signaling in a number of tissues ( Ramírez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999 62. Ramírez-Weber, F.-A. ∙ Kornberg, T.B.

Membrane tethers (cytocinches) have E-cadherin accumulation, related to Figure 6 2D sections of two anterior buds showing tethers (red arrows) with E-Cadherin accumulation using Tg (Cdh1:Cdh1-sfGFP) at 6 hpb. Scale bar, 10 μm.
Using time-lapse imaging, we observed that tethers eventually break and retract on time scales of minutes ( Figures 6 A and 6C–6E; Videos S4 and S5 ). Akin to the laser-ablation-induced recoil of cell-cell apical junctions to probe tension ( Fierro-González et al., 2013 27. Fierro-González, J.C. ∙ White, M.D. ∙ Silva, J.C. ... Cadherin-dependent filopodia control preimplantation embryo compaction Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15 :1424-1433 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rauzi and Lenne, 2015 63. Rauzi, M. ∙ Lenne, P.F. Probing cell mechanics with subcellular laser dissection of actomyosin networks in the early developing Drosophila embryo Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1189 :209-218 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), the breaking of tethers served as a natural tension probe ( Figure 6 E). Tether retraction was associated with a significant widening of adjacent membrane angles and an increase in neighboring cell distance ( Figures 6 E and 6F). In contrast, untethered membrane protrusion retraction (observed using mosaic membrane labeling) did not associate with a membrane angle change ( Figures 6 E and 6F). These measurements show that tethers are under tension. Notably, the breaking of tethers was not observed in HAase-treated embryos, resulting in a longer tether duration ( Figure 6 G), thereby showing that HA-induced pressure generates the epithelial stresses needed to break the tethers. Conversely, the expression of a heat-shock-inducible dominant-negative mutant (DN) of E-cadherin, which cannot engage in trans -clusters, results in a significant decrease in the number of tethers ( Figure 6 H). Together, these data show that adhesive and tension-rich cinched tethers resist ECM pressure. We therefore termed them “cytocinches.”
We tested whether cytocinches are responsible for the anisotropy in bud shape. During bud extension, cytocinch tether numbers progressively increased with an orientation that was strongly biased toward the circumferential axis ( Figures 7 A and 7B; Videos S4 and S5 ). Strikingly, cytocinch anisotropy (measured as the product of number and orientation) correlated with the anisotropic aspect ratios of the bud ( Figure 7 C). If cytocinches resist pressure from HA, the anisotropic stiffness from this directional bias could explain the elongation of buds into tubes. To further explore this hypothesis, we built a theoretical model to examine if a cytocinch-based bias in resistance in the circumferential axis can result in bud extension in the orthogonal (longitudinal) axis ( Figure 7 D). A 2D vertex model ( Alt et al., 2017 2. Alt, S. ∙ Ganguly, P. ∙ Salbreux, G. Vertex models: from cell mechanics to tissue morphogenesis Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 372 :20150520 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hannezo et al., 2014 35. Hannezo, E. ∙ Prost, J. ∙ Joanny, J.-F. Theory of epithelial sheet morphology in three dimensions Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :27-32 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ) representing a longitudinal “slice” of the epithelial monolayer, enclosing a gradually increasing volume of bud-ECM and attached to the BM at the boundaries, was used (see STAR Methods and Data S1 for further details). The equilibrium configuration via energy minimization for a given volume was then calculated. Geometrical parameters and epithelial surface tension were estimated using membrane image data and actomyosin localization, respectively ( Figures S4 A–S4D; STAR Methods ). The only free parameter was the inward tension from the cytocinches applied to the basal vertices ( Figures 7 E and S5 A–S5D; STAR Methods ). Consistent with our hypothesis, increasing the tension of circumferential cytocinches increased the anisotropy of the buds ( Figures 7 E, 7F, S5 E, and S5F; Video S6 ). Interestingly, for intermediate values of cytocinch tensions, the bud short axis remained roughly constant during 3-fold volume inflation, while the long axis increased by 3-fold ( Figures 7 F and S5 E), as observed experimentally ( Figure 5 K). A good fit for bud anisotropy can be reached in simulations either by slowly increasing the volume to a given level or by simply starting at that level ( Figures S5 F and S5G), corroborating our conclusion that the bud-ECM is important for bud swelling but not for its anisotropy. On the other hand, a progressive increase in the cytocinch number was required for a good fit with experimental data, otherwise the model would overestimate early bud anisotropy ( Figures S5 F and S5H), corroborating the observed scaling between cytocinch and bud anisotropies ( Figure 7 C). Furthermore, the model predicted a relaxation of the bud to a hemispherical shape upon removal of cytocinch tension ( Figure 7 G; Video S6 ).

A 2D vertex model recapitulates control, hyaluronidase, and CytoD-treated bud morphologies, related to Figure 7 Equilibrium configurations of a bud section over ‘time’ (hours post budding), modeled via the 2D vertex model representing apical, lateral, and basal tensions on the cell surfaces (gray arrows), and inward forces from cytocinches (green dots). ECM-bud volume and cytocinch frequency increase in time (as experimentally measured). X and Y axes are short and long respectively. Left panel is control, middle panel represents Hyaluronidase treatment (through reduction in bud-ECM volume), and right panel represents Cytochalasin D treatment (through removal of cytocinches), each at 7 hpb.
To experimentally test if cytocinches direct bud extension via mechanical anisotropy, we inhibited their tension using either Cytochalasin D (CytoD), an antagonist of F-actin polymerization, or SMIFH2, an inhibitor of formin (an actin polymerization protein). Injecting a mild drug dose (1 mM) in the periotic space did not affect OV integrity on short time scales but resulted in a complete loss of cytocinches and the subsequent widening of adjacent membrane angles ( Figures 7 H, 7I, and S6 A–S6E). The loss of cytocinches caused the bud radii to increase in the circumferential axis and the aspect ratio of the buds to become significantly isotropic ( Figures 7 H, 7J, S6 A, S6C, S6D, and S6F; Video S6 ), showing that cytocinches restrain extension in this axis. In addition, the loss of epithelial tension resulted in a significant increase in the bud-ECM volume, further corroborating a hyaluronate-pressure-based model of epithelial budding ( Figure S6 G). Together with theory and experiments, we conclude that biased circumferential orientation of cytocinches constrain the isotropic hyaluronate pressure into an anisotropic bud extension ( Figures 7 K and S7 ; Video S6 ).

Section: Discussion

Previous studies of tissue morphogenesis typically impute actomyosin contractility as the force producing process. The ECM is deemed as a passive mechanical element that might help shape those forces. Our observations challenge this standard model. We propose an active and isotropic hyaluronate pressure-based model in the inner ear wherein the patterned synthesis of HA-rich ECM powers bud growth by osmotic swelling. The data that support our model include the: (1) HA-dependent stretch experienced by the bud cells; (2) uniform expression of HA synthesis genes across the bud, and uniform structural properties of the HA-rich bud-ECM; (3) HA-dependent breaking and retraction of cytocinches; (4) increase of HA-rich bud-ECM volume upon cytocinch inhibition; and finally, (5) pressure equilibration of hyaluronate in the time scales of morphogenetic deformations. HA-driven morphogenesis of the bud is shaped by the biased orientation of E-cadherin and actomyosin-rich cytocinches in the circumferential axis that result in a greater tissue stiffness in this axis, thereby directing the bud toward a tube. The spatial patterning of extracellular hyaluronate pressure combined with anisotropic tissue material properties from cytocinches may serve as a broadly applicable mechanism for sculpting tissues during development.
Remarkably, hyaluronan synthases are locally expressed in a variety of morphogenic epithelia such as the tooth placode, the endocardium, and the lens placode ( Felszeghy et al., 2001 26.

Three vertebrate hyaluronan synthases are expressed during mouse development in distinct spatial and temporal patterns Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233 :130-141 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to the otic epithelium, HA may be creating pressure to drive morphogenesis of these tissues. Furthermore, the local expression of HA is conserved in the otic epithelial cells of mice ( Tien and Spicer, 2005 77. Tien, J.Y.L. ∙ Spicer, A.P. Three vertebrate hyaluronan synthases are expressed during mouse development in distinct spatial and temporal patterns Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233 :130-141 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a conserved mechanism for SCC morphogenesis across species. The upstream developmental signals that pattern the otic epithelial cells for HA expression and budding remain to be investigated.
HA is involved in a number of cellular processes including migration, adhesion, and differentiation due to binding with cell-surface receptors and interactions with other ECM components such as proteoglycans ( Chanmee et al., 2015 12. Chanmee, T. ∙ Ontong, P. ∙ Itano, N. Hyaluronan: Cancer and Cancer Metastasis Springer Japan, Taniguchi, N. ∙ Endo, T. ∙ Hart, G.W. ... (Editors) in: Glycoscience: Biology and Medicine. 2015; 1411-1417 Google Scholar ; Toole, 2001 79. Toole, B.P. Hyaluronan in morphogenesis Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12 :79-87 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, in mouse, the covalent modification of HA by the enzyme Tsg-6 is required for mid-gut laterality ( Sivakumar et al., 2018 70. Sivakumar, A. ∙ Mahadevan, A. ∙ Lauer, M.E. ... Midgut Laterality Is Driven by Hyaluronan on the Right Dev. Cell. 2018; 46 :533-551.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). In zebrafish, the bud cells of the otic epithelium express Versican ( vcana and vcanb ) ( Geng et al., 2013 29. Geng, F.-S. ∙ Abbas, L. ∙ Baxendale, S. ... Semicircular canal morphogenesis in the zebrafish inner ear requires the function of gpr126 (lauscher), an adhesion class G protein-coupled receptor gene Development. 2013; 140 :4362-4374 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), a proteoglycan that can regulate the structural properties of HA ( Wight, 2017 90. Wight, T.N. Provisional matrix: A role for versican and hyaluronan Matrix Biol. 2017; 60-61 :38-56 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). The contribution of HA-mediated signaling and binding with proteoglycans in SCC morphogenesis still remains to be explored.
Our work shows that actomyosin-rich cytocinches resist hyaluronate pressure. Most literature on actomyosin attributes its role in morphogenesis to contractility gradients that power local cell deformations ( Salbreux et al., 2012 65. Salbreux, G. ∙ Charras, G. ∙ Paluch, E. Actin cortex mechanics and cellular morphogenesis Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22 :536-545 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, there is an important role of actomyosin networks in stiffening tissues without powering morphogenesis. For instance, actomyosin-dependent tissue stiffening has been observed during axis elongation in frogs and is suggested to maintain tissue architecture ( Barriga et al., 2018 3. Barriga, E.H. ∙ Franze, K. ∙ Charras, G. ... Tissue stiffening coordinates morphogenesis by triggering collective cell migration in vivo Nature. 2018; 554 :523-527 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2009 96. Zhou, J. ∙ Kim, H.Y. ∙ Davidson, L.A. Actomyosin stiffens the vertebrate embryo during crucial stages of elongation and neural tube closure Development. 2009; 136 :677-688 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Developmental biologists tend to equate a high local density of myosin II with active contractility ( Streichan et al., 2018 71. Streichan, S.J. ∙ Lefebvre, M.F. ∙ Noll, N. ... Global morphogenetic flow is accurately predicted by the spatial distribution of myosin motors eLife. 2018; 7 :e27454 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that this assumption should always be questioned. Resistance to forces by anisotropic tissue material properties from cytocinches may serve as a broadly applicable mechanism in tissue morphogenesis.
HA-dependent breaking of cytocinches suggests that adjacent contacts in the budding cells are fractured by hyaluronate pressure, leaving behind cytocinches due to stable E-cadherin trans -clusters. Hydraulic fracturing of cell-cell junctions has been reported in epithelial monolayers by extracellular pressures ( Casares et al., 2015 9. Casares, L. ∙ Vincent, R. ∙ Zalvidea, D. ... Hydraulic fracture during epithelial stretching Nat. Mater. 2015; 14 :343-351 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the mouse blastocyst, fluid pressure fractures cell-cell contacts into microlumens that eventually form a single dominant lumen ( Dumortier et al., 2019 24. Dumortier, J.G. ∙ Le Verge-Serandour, M. ∙ Tortorelli, A.F. ... Hydraulic fracturing and active coarsening position the lumen of the mouse blastocyst Science. 2019; 365 :465-468 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether HA results in protrusion and cytocinch formation through hydraulic fracking or other means still remains to be explored. Moreover, further investigation is needed to determine how cytocinches relate to other cellular protrusions ( Chauhan et al., 2009 15. Chauhan, B.K. ∙ Disanza, A. ∙ Choi, S.-Y. ...

With our work, it is now clear that the sources of force production can be cellular (e.g., actomyosin contractility), tissue scale (e.g., global proliferation), or ECM-derived (e.g., hyaluronate pressure). Sources of anisotropic stiffness can also be cellular (e.g., cortical tension), tissue scale (e.g., cytocinches), or ECM-derived (aligned collagen fibers). Our data compel a unifying paradigm for tissue morphogenesis whereby any or a combination of these sources of force production and anisotropic stiffness can sculpt intricate organs from simple embryonic tissues.

Section: Limitations of the study

While we provide indirect evidence and cite supporting literature, we do not provide a direct measurement for hyaluronate pressure in the bud-ECM, as this has been technically challenging in vivo . In addition, while the data point toward a fracking-based mechanism for cytocinch formation, our study lacks experiments to test this model.

The a ctb2:mem-neongreen-neongreen construct was made using previously reported membrane localization tags with two copies of moxNeonGreen subcloned downstream of the actb2 promoter into a pMTB backbone (described here ( Collins et al., 2018 18. Collins, Z. ∙ Ishimatsu, K. ∙ Tsai, T. ...

For mosaic membrane labeling, 90 pg of Tol2 mRNA was injected with either a ctb2:mem-neongreen-neongreen or actb2:mem-mcherry2 (15ng/ul final concentration) into embryos from either Tg( β Actin:Utrophin-mCherry) or Tg( β Actin:Myl12.1-eGFP) respectively ( Figures 6 C, 6E (bottom), and S4 E ).
The hsp70l:DN-Cdh1-Cardinal plasmid was constructed in two steps. We first constructed the dominant- negative E-Cadherin (DN-Cdh1), missing the bulk of the extracellular domain, including the ectodomains (EC1-EC4) important for homophilic binding. DNA sequence containing the first 107 amino acid of cdh1 was amplified from cDNA of 14hpf AB strain zebrafish by PCR reaction with the following pair of primers: forward primer: agctacttgttctttttgcagga; reverse primer: ttttatggtcctttcattaataacaggactggagtcccaggcatg. DNA sequence containing the last 286 amino acid of cdh1 was amplified from cDNA of 14hpf AB strain zebrafish by PCR reaction with the following pair of primers. Forward primer: catgcctgggactccagtcctgttattaatgaaaggaccataaaa; Reverse primer: tgtatcttatcatgtctggatcacc
The plasmid backbone containing heat-shock inducible promoter (hsp70l) was digested by BamHI and AgeI, gel purified, and assemble with the two PCR products by isothermal assembly. After obtaining the dominant-negative Cdh1 (DN-Cdh1), we further tagged it with fluorescent protein mCardinal. The DN-Cdh1 construct was PCR amplified with the following primers: forward primer: agctacttgttctttttgcagga; reverse primer: ccagctggcgctccatcctctcctcctccatacatgt. The mCardinal DNA was s amplified from a previously made construct (( Liu et al., 2018 48. Liu, T.-L. ∙ Upadhyayula, S. ∙ Milkie, D.E. ...

The plasmid backbone containing heat-shock inducible promoter (hsp70l) was digested by BamHI and AgeI, gel purified, and assemble with the two PCR products by isothermal assembly to make the final plasmid hsp:DN-cdh1-cardinal .
90 pg of Tol2 mRNA was injected with plasmid DNA for hsp:DN-cdh1-cardinal (15ng/ul final concentration) into embryos from Tg( β Actin:membrane-Citrine) at single cell stage. 50 hpf embryos (with their chorion) were heat shocked at 38°C for 20 mins in pre-warmed 1X Danieau buffer. Embryos were kept at 28°C post heat-shock to allow DN E-Cad expression and imaged after 2 hours (52 hpf) ( Figure 6 H).
Two previously characterized morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) ( Ouyang et al., 2017 59. Ouyang, X. ∙ Panetta, N.J. ∙ Talbott, M.D. ... Hyaluronic acid synthesis is required for zebrafish tail fin regeneration PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0171898 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) targeting either has3 start codon (MO-1) or the intron 2-exon 3 splice junction (MO-2) were purchased from Gene Tools along with their Standard Control MO. 7ng of either has3 MO-1 or has3 MO-2 or control MO was injected with 3.5ng of p53 MO (to control for phenotypic variability ( Gerety and Wilkinson, 2011 30. Gerety, S.S. ∙ Wilkinson, D.G. Morpholino artifacts provide pitfalls and reveal a novel role for pro-apoptotic genes in hindbrain boundary development Dev.

The efficiency of MO-2 mediated mis-splicing was verified by RT-PCR using the primers: 5′CCTGATGTGGGAGGA-GTTGGAGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGACGCGGTTGGTGAGATGTCG-3′ (reverse) ( Figure 2 G).
Dechorionated embryos were mounted dorso-laterally (as shown in Figure 1 C) using a canyon mount cast in 1% agarose filled with 1X Danieau buffer as previously described in detail ( Swinburne et al., 2018 73. Swinburne, I.A. ∙ Mosaliganti, K.R. ∙ Upadhyayula, S. ... Lamellar projections in the endolymphatic sac act as a relief valve to regulate inner ear pressure eLife. 2018; 7 :e37131 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Confocal z stacks were acquired with an upright Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope using a C-Apochromat 40X 1.2 NA objective for all fluorescence microscopy data, except Figures S3 A, 6 A, 6B, 6D, and 6H, where Zeiss LSM 980 laser scanning confocal microscope with C-Apochromat 40X 1.2 NA objective and Airy Scan 2 module was used. For single time points, embryos were immobilized by soaking in 1% tricaine. For long-term time lapse imaging, embryos were immobilized with 500 μM α-bungarotoxin protein (aBt from Tocris) ( Swinburne et al., 2015 72. Swinburne, I.A. ∙ Mosaliganti, K.R. ∙ Green, A.A. ... Improved Long-Term Imaging of Embryos with Genetically Encoded α-Bungarotoxin PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0134005 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) injected into the heart ∼30 minutes prior to imaging (at variable stages depending on the experiment). Time-lapse imaging took place in a home-built incubator at 28.5°C. In a typical experiment using Zeiss LSM 710, ∼250 μm X 250 μm X 150 μm volume with a voxel size ∼0.2 μm X 0.2 μm X 0.5 μm captured the entire OV within ∼3 minutes. With the better resolution of the Zeiss LSM 980 Airy Scan 2, the voxel size improved to ∼0.12 μm X 0.12 μm X 0.35 μm. The volume and speed of acquisition was adjusted depending on the experiment.
Ablation of cells in the OV were performed using a Mai-Tai HP 2-photon laser (Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, CA) as previously described in detail ( Mosaliganti et al., 2019 51. Mosaliganti, K.R. ∙ Swinburne, I.A. ∙ Chan, C.U. ... Size control of the inner ear via hydraulic feedback eLife. 2019; 8 :e39596 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the 2-photon laser was tuned to 800 nm at 50%–75% power. The pinhole was opened completely and a spot scan at the target cell was performed for 10,000 cycles. To monitor ablation, 3 kDa Texas red-Dextran dye was injected into the heart to label the periotic space. Successful ablation disrupted the otic epithelium causing the dye to enter the OV lumen.
45 hpf dechorionated AB wild-type embryos were kept in 500 uM 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU), a proliferative marker ( Salic and Mitchison, 2008 66. Salic, A. ∙ Mitchison, T.J.

The embryos were transferred back at 28.5°C in fresh 1X Danieau buffer containing 50 uM EdU, without (control) or with 20 mM Hydroxyurea and 300 μM Aphidicolin, and a final concentration of 1% DMSO for 9 hours (45-54 hpf). Embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1X phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours. Embryos were then permeabilized in pre-chilled acetone at −20°C for 7min, rinsed in 1% Triton in 1X PBS for 5 minutes (thrice) and blocked with 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in 1X PBS for 30 minutes. For EdU detection, embryos were transferred to a freshly prepared click-iT® reaction mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30mins, at room temperature (RT) in dark. Embryos were washed with 0.1% Tween-20 in 1X PBS (PBT) for 5 mins (5 times) and stained overnight at 4°C with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to detect DNA.
HCR probes; amplifiers; and hybridization, wash, and amplification buffers were bought from Molecular Instruments ( Choi et al., 2018 17. Choi, H.M.T. ∙ Schwarzkopf, M. ∙ Fornace, M.E. ... Third-generation in situ hybridization chain reaction: multiplexed, quantitative, sensitive, versatile, robust Development. 2018; 145 :dev165753 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dechorionated embryos at various stages were fixed with 4% PFA in 1X PBS at RT for 2 hours, followed by PBS washing for 5 mins (five times) and permeabilization in pre-chilled acetone at −20°C for 7 min. Embryos were washed with PBS again, and pre-hybridized in hybridization buffer, followed by incubation in hybridization solution containing 1 pg of probes overnight at 37°C. Embryos were then washed in wash buffer followed by washes with 0.1% of Tween-20 in 5X SSC buffer (5X SSCT) for 5 minutes, twice. Embryos were then incubated in amplification buffer for 30 minutes at RT. Meanwhile, hairpin mixtures were prepared by heating 12 pmol of hairpin 1 and 2 per sample to 95°C for 90 s, and snap-cooled in the dark. The prepared hairpins were added to the amplification buffer. Embryos were incubated in the hairpin mixture overnight, at RT in dark. Embryos were then washed in 5X SSCT (5 times) and mounted for confocal microscopy (or stored at 4°C). For each embryo, two HCR probes were used and visualized with amplifiers conjugated with AlexaFlour™ (AF) 546 and AF647.
Dechorionated embryos (either uninjected or treated as described below) at various stages were fixed with 4% PFA in 1X PBS at RT for 2 hours, followed by PBS washing for 5 mins (thrice), and permeabilization in pre-chilled acetone at −20°C for 7 min. Embryos were then rinsed in 1X PBT for 5 minutes, thrice, and blocked with 5% BSA in 1X PBT for 60 minutes. Embryos were then incubated with primary solution containing either Laminin antibody (from Sigma-Aldrich, polyclonal, rabbit, 1:200 dilution) or Collagen 2 antibody (from GeneTex, polyclonal, rabbit, 1:200 dilution), and biotinylated- Hyaluronan Binding Protein (HABP from EMD Millipore, 1:100 dilution) at 4°C, overnight. Embryos were washed with 1X PBS (Tween-20 was avoided as HABP binds to HA with lower affinity compared to antibody-immunogen binding) for 15 mins, thrice. Embryos were incubated with a cocktail of fluorescent labeled secondary antibody (against rabbit), Streptavidin (against Biotin) and Phalloidin (to label F-Actin) at 4°C, overnight. Embryos were washed with PBS for 15 mins, thrice and mounted for confocal microscopy (or stored at 4°C).
Dechorionated embryos (at various stages) were soaked in 1X tricaine and immobilized in a 1% canyon mount filled with 1X Danieau buffer. All injection solutions were made with 1X PBS/0.5% Phenol Red. Streptomyces hyaluronidase (HAase from Sigma dissolved in 1X PBS, 300 unit/ml from 3000unit/ml stock) was injected in the periotic space (anterior and posterior to the OV). Control injection solution did not contain HAase. To monitor injections, 3 kDa Texas-red Dextran (from Thermo Fisher dissolved in 1X PBS, 0.5 mg/ml from 20 mg/ml stock) was injected with HAase or control.

Neutral Texas-red dextran (either 3 kDa, 10 kDa or 70 kDa from Thermo Fisher dissolved in 1X PBS, 500 μM from 10 mM stock) was co-injected with AF647 conjugated aBt (from Thermo Fisher dissolved in 1X PBS, 500 μM from 1 mM stock) into the periotic space (anterior and posterior to the OV). Embryos were imaged 2 hours post injection.

Bud lengths were measured manually using the “straight-line” tool in Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 68. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lines were drawn in the middle sections of the bud and averaged from three different planes for each bud. Where budding had not started or in perturbations where budding was affected, bud lengths correspond to average cell lengths distinguished by their unique taller morphology (visible in Figures S1 A–S1C).
Manual segmentations of the OV lumen volume and bud-ECM volume were performed in ITK-SNAP ( Yushkevich et al., 2006 95. Yushkevich, P.A. ∙ Piven, J. ∙ Hazlett, H.C. ...

The number of voxels that belong to the mesh were converted to picolitre using the known voxel resolution.
Total number of nuclei and EdU positive nuclei were manually counted in a fixed volume of 3D rendered OVs (z depth 80 μm starting from the dorsal most plane) in Fiji.
Number of embryos injected with either membrane-NeonGreen mRNA or morpholinos with visible aberrant morphologies by the total number of embryos measured at 72 hpf.
Fluorescent intensity measurements of the two HCR probes per embryo were made in Fiji using maximum intensity z-projections covering the entire anterior bud at 57 hpf (25 μm z-depth). Using the “freehand-line” tool (width 20 pixels), region of interest (ROI) was drawn manually as illustrated in Figure 3 C, and the mean intensity traces across the line were obtained using the “plot profile” tool. Embryos were carefully staged and mounted, and lines of equal length were drawn and registered at the first cell of the bud to allow comparison between embryos. Intensity traces were normalized to the maximum value, smoothed and averaged.
Fluorescent intensity measurements of Collagen 2 and HABP staining were made in Fiji using maximum intensity z-projections covering both lateral buds at 48 hpf (20 μm z-depth). Using the “freehand-line” tool (width 10 pixels), ROI was drawn manually as illustrated in Figure 4 E and the mean intensity traces across the line were procured using the “plot profile” tool. Embryos were carefully staged, and lines of equal length were drawn and registered at the first cell of the antero-lateral bud to allow comparison between embryos. Intensity traces were normalized to the maximum value, smoothed and averaged.
Percolation of different sizes of dextran was measured in Fiji using maximum intensity z-projections covering all lateral bud-ECM at 52 hpf (10 μm z-depth). ROIs in the bud ECM and the periotic space were drawn manually (as illustrated in Figure S3 D). Mean intensity in the red channel (Texas-red Dextran) was normalized to the mean intensity in the far-red channel (aBt). Percolation was measured as a ratio of the normalized intensity in the bud-ECM to the normalized intensity in the periotic space.
Structural uniformity of the bud ECM was measured by drawing a line of width 10 pixels the from base to the tip of the bud (as illustrated in Figure S3 D). Mean intensity trace across the line was obtained using the “plot profile” tool for various sizes of dextran and HABP staining. Intensity traces were normalized to their mean, averaged and smoothed.
Longitudinal cell diameters and longitudinal bud radii were manually measured in Fiji using the “straight-line” tool in the middle XY plane (side view) of either anterior or posterior buds. Line was drawn across the length of the cell for measuring cell diameter, or across the length of the bud for measuring bud radius. Circumferential and radial cell diameters, and circumferential bud radii were measured in the middle XZ plane (transverse view) (as illustrated by the dotted line in Figure 5 G) of either anterior or posterior buds. Circumferential and radial cell diameters were measured using the “line” tool by manually drawing a line across the length and the width of the cell respectively. Circumferential bud radii were measured manually by drawing a polygon outlining the apical circumference of the bud. The polygon was fit to an ellipse by Fiji to obtain the radius (since the short and the long axis of the ellipse were comparable).
Fluorescent intensity measurements of F-Actin ( Tg( β Actin:Utrophin-mCherry) and Myosin II ( Tg( β Actin:Myl12.1-eGFP)) were made in Fiji using maximum intensity z-projections covering the cells in the middle plane of either anterior or posterior buds (8 μm z-depth). Using the “line” tool (width 5 pixels), ROI was drawn manually inside the cell at the apical, lateral or basal surface to obtain mean intensities.
• Tether duration was calculated by measuring the time spent by the protrusions in tethered-form before retraction. The start was the first frame of the time-lapse. • Distance between cells from which tethers originate a time frame before and immediately after tether retracts, were measured manually using the Fiji “line” tool as illustrated in Figure 6 E. • Membrane angles of cells from which cytocinches originate a time frame before and immediately after tether retracts, were measured manually using the Fiji “angle” tool. • To accurately estimate the total number of cytocinch tethers at a given time point, tethers were tracked in time-lapses using their tension signatures (membrane angle and recoil distances as described above). • Cytocinch number per cell was calculated by dividing the total number of cytocinches in tethers (i.e., number of tethers in Figure 7 A multiplied by 2) by the total number of the cells in the bud (counted manually from 3D renderings) at a given time point. • Cytocinch tether angles were measured with respect to the longitudinal axis of the bud using the Fiji “angle” tool. Cytocinches were detected using their tension signatures (membrane angle and recoil distances as described above). • Cytocinch anisotropy- Cytocinch anisotropy was calculating by decomposing tether angles into their x (circumferential) and y (longitudinal) components. y component was then subtracted from x, averaged for all cytocinch tethers in a bud at a given time point, multiplied by the total tether numbers at that time point, and plotted against the aspect ratio of the bud at that time point.
Here we provide additional information into the modeling approach, parameter fitting, and data-theory comparisons used to understand bud extension during ear morphogenesis. The complete code in Python is provided ( Data S1 ).
We start by considering the equilibrium of a single cell, under differential tensions on its apical, lateral, and basal areas (respectively denoted 𝛾 𝑎 , 𝛾 𝑙 and 𝛾 𝑏 ). The energy of a single cell of height ℎ , apical length 𝑟 𝑎 and basal length 𝑟 𝑏 then reads ( Fouchard et al., 2020 28. Fouchard, J. ∙ Wyatt, T.P.J. ∙ Proag, A. ...

Moreover, epithelial cells may be considered incompressible, with constant volume (or here 2D area 𝐴 = 𝐴 0 , which we implement by taking very large compressibility values 𝐾 → ∞ ), given the small forces generated by actomyosin structures, compared to osmotic forces ( Salbreux et al., 2012 65. Salbreux, G. ∙ Charras, G. ∙ Paluch, E. Actin cortex mechanics and cellular morphogenesis Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22 :536-545 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is valid since cell volume does not change appreciably over the timescales considered ( Figure 5 C).
We thus consider the ear as consisting of 𝑁 identical such cells (all having the same volume/area and tension parameters 𝛾 𝑙 , 𝑎 , 𝑏 . Finally, given the experimental findings of a key role for ECM-driven pressure for bud growth, we consider that the epithelial monolayer encloses an incompressible fluid of fixed volume 𝑉 𝑀 ( Yang et al., 2021 94. Yang, Q. ∙ Xue, S.-L. ∙ Chan, C.J. ... Cell fate coordinates mechano-osmotic forces in intestinal crypt formation Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :733-744 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar )(which we similarly implement by a quadratic terms around a fixed (but changing in time) area 𝐴 𝑀 = 𝐴 0 𝑀 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) in our 2D description, with high compressibility 𝐾 𝑀 → ∞ ), such that the total energy of the monolayer reads 𝐸 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖 = 1 ( 𝛾 𝑙 ⁢ ℎ 𝑖 + 𝛾 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑖 𝑎 + 𝛾 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑖 𝑏 + 𝐾 ⁢ ( 𝐴 𝑖 − 𝐴 0 ) 2 ) + 𝐾 𝑀 ⁢ ( 𝐴 𝑀 − 𝐴 0 𝑀 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) ) 2 There are therefore two types of control parameters in the system: ECM-controlled temporal changes of volume 𝐴 0 𝑀 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) and cellular-level changes in tensions 𝛾 𝑙 , 𝑎 , 𝑏 (largely controlled by actomyosin contractility, which can change the shape of the bud at constant overall volume ( Salbreux et al., 2012 65. Salbreux, G. ∙ Charras, G. ∙ Paluch, E. Actin cortex mechanics and cellular morphogenesis Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22 :536-545 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar )).
Finally, this model is complemented with boundary conditions for the border cells 𝑖 = 1 and 𝑖 = 𝑁 , which are the ones remaining in contact with the flat monolayer at position 𝑦 = 0 surrounding the bud. To simulate the rest of the monolayer and ECM attachment, we fix the position of their basal/apical vertex to the plane 𝑦 = 0 while still allowing translations on the plane. Denoting ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑏 , 𝑦 𝑖 𝑏 ) and ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑎 , 𝑦 𝑖 𝑎 ) the ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) positions of the basal and apical vertices, this translate into 𝑦 1 𝑏 = 𝑦 𝑁 𝑏 = 𝑦 1 𝑎 = 𝑦 𝑁 𝑎 = = 0 . We impose a constant lateral distance for the boundary vertices (as otherwise, the absence of a next cell promotes lateral junction collapse). We also tested an alternative, fully clamped boundary conditions (where both 𝑥 and 𝑦 displacements of boundary vertices are forbidden, and found very similar results).
From past theoretical study, we know that such cytocinch-free model will display a buckling transition if there is a mismatch between the preferred area of cells and the volume of the monolayer. For larger hemi-spherical buds (which are indeed observed experimentally when inhibiting cytocinches, see Figures 7 H and S6 ), we can calculate from Eq. S1 that 𝑟 𝑎 ≈ 𝑟 𝑏 and the equilibrium configuration of a single cell is 𝑟 𝑎 ≈ √ 𝐴 0 ⁢ 𝛾 𝑙 𝛾 𝑎 + 𝛾 𝑏 , ℎ = 𝐴 0 / 𝑟 𝑎 . The stress-free state of the bud is one where the ECM volume exactly matches the equilibrium configuration of the monolayer, so that 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑎 = √ 2 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝐴 0 𝑀 , so that for larger 𝐴 0 𝑀 , the epithelium will be in a tensile configuration, while being compressed for lower 𝐴 0 𝑀 , which can trigger monolayer buckling ( Figure S5 A) ( Trushko et al., 2020 80. Trushko, A. ∙ Di Meglio, I. ∙ Merzouki, A. ... Buckling of an Epithelium Growing under Spherical Confinement Dev. Cell. 2020; 54 :655-668.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Numerical simulations of the equilibrium configurations of the bud for different 𝐴 0 𝑀 and/or different 𝛾 𝑙 confirmed this. Here however, we find no evidence of buckling in the system (see discussion in main text). Instead, ECM volume increase causes a marked flattening of cells, which go from being columnar early on to flattened and squamous like ( Figures 5 G and 5H), as expected in the model for cells with near constant volume. Furthermore, we do not find folding/buckling either upon pharmacological reduction of ECM volume 𝐴 0 𝑀 ( Figures 5 A and 5G), with cells instead going back to cuboidal/columnar, again in agreement with the hypothesis of ECM-driven pressure putting the bud under tension.
Next, we asked whether boundary conditions could be enough to bias the orientation of bud growth, and give rise to elongated structures. We reasoned for instance that a supracellular contractile ring, forming at the base of the buds by cytocinches, could constrain their growth to the axial direction ( Turlier et al., 2014 81. Turlier, H. ∙ Audoly, B. ∙ Prost, J. ... Furrow constriction in animal cell cytokinesis Biophys. J. 2014; 106 :114-123 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in such a model, the local tension within the rest of the monolayer would still be isotropic, which is then predicted to give rise to identical curvatures in both directions (see Figure S5 B for example of a numerical simulations with cytocinches only for the vertices at the base), similar to the wetting-de-wetting transitions of droplets.
However, given the anisotropy observed in cytocinch tension, we reasoned that this could provide a mechanism to give rise to anisotropic tensions within the monolayer, and therefore proceeded to incorporated them into our model.
We now consider the consequence of cytocinches exclusively in the orthoradial direction (i.e., perpendicular to the 2D section that we model). This induces an additional contribution to surface tension, which tends to shrink locally the radius of the bud (a “purse-string” mechanism), which adds an energy term on basal vertex ( 𝑥 𝑖 𝑏 , 𝑦 𝑖 𝑏 ) for each cytocinch: 𝑈 𝑖 𝑐 = 𝛬 ⁢ 𝑥 𝑖 𝑏 where 𝛬 is the cytocinch tension (which tends to minimize the local radius 𝑥 𝑖 𝑏 of the bud in the 𝑦 = 𝑦 𝑖 𝑏 plane), and we note 𝑝 𝑐 the probability of a given vertex displaying a cytocinch (which increases in time experimentally as well as becoming more directed circumferentially, see Figures 7 A and 7B). For the sake of simplicity, we do not include in the model cytocinches in the other, tangential direction, as this simply adds a term which rescales the basal tension 𝛾 𝑏 .
Before proceeding to run full simulations, we first proceeded to constrain the parameters of the model. From a qualitative perspective, as the bud short-axis is of the order of cell size, and that the tethered cytocinches cause large deflection of vertices (with typical angles 𝜃 𝑚 ≈ 9 0 ° from Figures 6 E and 6F), this means from local force balance that cytocinch tension 𝛬 should be of comparable magnitude as the surface tensions 𝛾 𝑏 .
To make this more quantitative, we computed the equilibrium shape of a bud with constant, time-invariant volume and a single cytocinch exerting forces on a single basal vertex ( Figures S5 A–S5D) - first considering the simplified case of all surface tensions being equal 𝛾 𝑎 , 𝑙 , 𝑏 = 1 . As expected, we found that increasing cytocinch tension increased the local angle of the basal surfaces at the point of force application ( Figure S5 A), up to a point where cytocinch forces are large enough to pinch off the bud (similar to modeling of cytokinesis). Interestingly, this is something that was observed experimentally, arguing that cytocinch tension is in the high regime.
However, we also found that maintaining 𝛾 𝑎 + 𝛾 𝑏 constant (and thus the global stretching resistance of the epithelium, (see ( Yang et al., 2021 94. Yang, Q. ∙ Xue, S.-L. ∙ Chan, C.J. ... Cell fate coordinates mechano-osmotic forces in intestinal crypt formation Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :733-744 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar )), but changing separately the balance of 𝛾 𝑎 and 𝛾 𝑏 modified the response of the epithelium with respect to local force application. In particular, increased basal tension led to higher bud stability (because this stabilizes the interface on which forces are directly applied, see Figure S5 A) whereas increase apical tension led to pinching/collapse of the lateral surfaces (which can occur even for little apical deformation) as shown in Figure S5 D. Interestingly, we observe experimentally a relocation of actomyosin from the apical to the basal side in time, as the fraction of cytocinches increases ( Figures 7 A and S4 ) - which we conjectured would be an adaptive response giving additional stability to ear bud morphogenesis.
Finally, as an additional control of our simulations, we tested the effect of alternative boundary conditions, in particular to relax our strong assumption of having the bottom-most vertices tightly bound along the y axis (see above). In particular, we also modeled the cells surrounding the bud, which we take to have exactly the same active tensions (although we do not implement cytocinch forces for these cells), and which we assume to be linked to the underlying BM (based on the experimental findings shown in Figure S3 A and modeled as an elastic force in the y-direction acting on the basal vertices of the surrounding cells: f i B M = − 𝑘 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑖 ). Note that the total cross-sectional area controlled by hyaluronan pressure 𝐴 𝑀 is now calculated taking into account all cell positions. Thus, for very low binding to the BM 𝑘 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑀 , surrounding cells are pulled upward by the pressure, giving rise to poorly defined, non-experimentally observed bud shapes ( Figure S5 I). However, for large values of 𝑘 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑀 (compared to the scale of other active tensions), we recovered very similar shape to the previous modeling of bud cells alone ( Figure S5 J)
From these observations and measurements, we then proceeded to constrain further the parameters of the model. After actomyosin relocation (i.e., the relevant anisotropic growth phase with cytocinches), we measured the relative intensities of Myosin on the lateral, basal, and apical surfaces (resp. 𝑚 𝑙 , 𝑚 𝑏 and 𝑚 𝑎 ), as a proxy to the tension ratios. We found 𝑚 𝑎 / 𝑚 𝑏 = 0 . 4 ± 0 . 0 8 and 𝑚 𝑎 / 𝑚 𝑙 = 0 . 7 ± 0 . 3 (see Figure S4 ).
In the following, we therefore non-dimensionalize all forces by 𝛾 𝑙 = 1 and take 𝛾 𝑎 = 0 . 7 , 𝛾 𝑏 = 1 . 7 5 . Unless specified, we simulate 𝑁 = 1 0 cells with varying ECM volume 𝐴 𝑀 0 (although we tested different numbers of cells, which did not give rise to significantly different results). We non-dimensionalize all cell length by the preferred cell area √ 𝐴 0 = 1 (note that with these values, the equilibrium apical length of a flat cell is √ 𝐴 0 ⁢ 𝛾 𝑙 𝛾 𝑎 + 𝛾 𝑏 ≈ 0 . 4 ), which is close to the experimental value, with a cellular aspect ratio initially around 2 : 1 at the early bud stage.
We use a Metropolis algorithm with small temperature to minimize the total energy of the system, performing the simulations multiple times to check that we converge toward the same steady state. Briefly, at each time point, we select 𝑁 times at random a basal vertex at random, move it by a random small change 𝛿 ⁢ 𝑟 = 0 . 0 5 and calculate the resulting difference in total energy 𝛥 ⁢ 𝐸 (accepting the move always if 𝛥 ⁢ 𝐸 < 0 or with a probability 𝑒 − 𝛥 ⁢ 𝐸 / 𝑇 if 𝛥 ⁢ 𝐸 > 0 (with 𝑇 = 1 0 − 4 ). We then do the same on the adjacent apical vertex. With 𝐾 = 1 0 and 𝐾 𝑀 = 0 . 1 , we find that we find all cell areas and ECM area close to their target configuration, while allowing for a non-negligible number of rejected Monte-Carlo steps, so that structures robustly converge to a steady-state for 𝑇 = 1 0 3 steps (we found that doubling the number of steps did not change the results). For numerical stability, we prohibited moves that shrank junctions to values smaller than a small cut-off ( 𝑙 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 = 0 . 3 ) .
Moreover, in simulations where we vary the ECM volume 𝐴 𝑀 0 , we do so in a slow manner, so that the monolayer is near equilibrium throughout the simulation ( 𝑇 = 5 . 1 0 4 steps, although we again found that doubling the step number did not change the results). Such quasi-static approximation is justified by the fact that ECM growth occurs very slowly at timescale of hours, which are much larger than the timescales of actomyosin-driven shape changes (minutes to tens of minutes). We thus define 𝐴 0 𝑀 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 𝑖 + ( 𝑎 𝑓 − 𝑎 𝑖 ) ⁢ 𝑡 (where we normalized time to be 1 at the end of the simulation, so that 𝑎 𝑖 and 𝑎 𝑓 are respectively the initial and final volumes/areas (measured experimentally to be 𝑎 𝑓 ≈ 3 ⁢ 𝑎 𝑖 between 1hpb and 9hpb, as shown on Figure 5 K).
Furthermore, guided by the increase in frequency of cytocinches in time, to a maximal value of around 0 . 5 cytocinch per cell ( Figure 7 A), we define the probability of a cytocinch on a given basal vertex as 𝑝 𝑐 = 0 . 5 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑒 − 𝑡 / 𝜏 𝑐 ) (zero at the beginning of the simulation and 0 . 5 at the end, with a build-up time of 𝜏 𝑐 ≈ 1 . 5 ⁢ ℎ based on Figure 7 A, although the results were weakly sensitive to this value). We also tested the effect of a constant, non-time-varying fraction of cytocinches (with 𝛬 = 0 . 8 ), and found, as expected that although the long-term effect was unchanged, this would predict smaller, early bud to be already highly anisotropic ( Figures S5 G and S5H), in contrast to the experimental data. This validates our hypothesis that cytocinch (and more specifically the increase of oriented cytocinches as a function of time) is crucial for the growing anisotropy of the buds. On the other hand, we also tested the converse scenario of increasing probabilities of cytocinches (as in WT simulations), but with a constant ECM volume. This led to anisotropies very similar to WT with volume increase (despite long and short axis being much shorter), also validating our hypothesis of ECM-bud volume growth being mainly responsible for overall bud inflation, but not anisotropic growth ( Figure S7 ).
One particular assumption here is that the tension in a given tethered cytocinch is constant in time (and thus that the increased anisotropy of the structure is driven by the increase in cytocinch number), an assumption motivated by the angle of basal deformation caused by cytocinches ( Figure 6 E), which we found to be comparable in early versus late buds. With this, as well as the various parameters constrained as described above, the main key parameter controlling the bud anisotropy that remains to be fitted is thus the tension 𝛬 .
For this, we computed the short 𝑎 and long axis 𝑏 of the bud in time during our simulation for different values of 𝛬 , as this provides a direct comparison to Figures 5 J and 5K. As expected, for 𝛬 = 0 , the structure was growing spherically, with the ratio of short and long axis converging toward 1 𝑎 / 𝑏 → 1 for large volumes, while the anisotropy increased for larger values of 𝛬 . Interestingly, we found that for intermediate values of 𝛬 ≈ 0 . 8 , the short-axis remained roughly constant in width, while the long-axis increased (3-fold to match the 3-fold increase in volume, see Figure S5 E and Video S6 ), very close to the experimental observations as shown on Figure 7 F. We also plot the anisotropy of the bud in time (calculated as the long axis length divided by the short axis at the base) for different values of 𝛬 , overlaying the points from 10 different runs of a simulation with identical parameters, to show the stochastic variability (due to the fact that cytocinch formation is a random event in the model) and robustness.
This behavior at intermediate 𝛬 = 0 . 8 ( Figures 4 G and S4 E) contrasts with lower values of 𝛬 , for which the short-axis markedly increase in size ( Figure S5 E) and larger values of 𝛬 , characterized in particular by mechanical instabilities which the bud is locally pinched off (and in particular at the base as we have not imposed boundary stresses in the 𝑥 direction). This argues that the data can be well-fitted ( Figure 7 F) by these intermediary values of constant 𝛬 (also consistent with the basal deformation angles observed in the data, as discussed above), and increasing number of cytocinches as a function of time. The model also showed near-uniform transition from a columnar epithelium to a squamous one upon bud-ECM volume growth, an effect which stems from the approximation of constant cell volume together with uniform cytocinch distribution in space, and which was reversed upon volume reduction as expected ( Figures 5 G–5I).
We then proceeded to test this further in the data, by directly comparing cytocinch number and anisotropy ratio 𝑎 / 𝑏 , with the prediction that these should strongly correlate in a quasi-linear manner (see prediction for different 𝛬 on Figures S5 E and S5F). Importantly, this was in close agreement with the data ( Figure 7 C). We also performed several pharmacological experiments to test the model. Disrupting cytocinches via CytoD decreases the aspect ratio 𝑎 / 𝑏 back to a value close to 1, as a expected for 𝛬 ≈ 0 in the model ( Figures 7 H–7J and Video S6 for a simulation where we turned off cytocinches to 𝛬 = 0 at 8h). Similar behavior was obtained by disrupting cytocinches with SMIFH2 ( Figures S6 and S7 ). Conversely, reducing volume as constant cytocinch strength/numbers is predicted to retain high anisotropy while shrinking ( Figures 5 G, S5 G, and S7 and Video S6 for a simulation where we go back to the initial ECM area 𝑎 𝑖 at 8h) as experimentally observed upon hyaluronidase treatment which causes a collapse of the ECM ( Figure 5 G).
Statistical methods were not used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was chosen such that statistical variability between experiments was captured and did not change significantly when more data points were added. No data were excluded. No experiments were randomized and the investigator was not blinded to any dataset. Each experiment was replicated at-least thrice. Statistics were done on all replicates pooled together.
Average values are calculated from ‘n’, where ‘n’ represents numbers of OVs, buds, bud-ECM, cells, cytocinch tethers, or cytocinches (as labeled in each figure). Plots show individual data points, mean values, and error bars (standard deviation or standard error of mean, as labeled). Non-parametric Mann–Whitney U -test was used to determine p values wherever mentioned. All statistical tests and plots were made in OriginPro.
