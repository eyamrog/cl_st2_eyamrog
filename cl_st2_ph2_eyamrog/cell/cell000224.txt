Title: Endocannabinoids Inhibit the Induction of Virulence in Enteric Pathogens


Abstract: Summary

Endocannabinoids are host-derived lipid hormones that fundamentally impact gastrointestinal (GI) biology. The use of cannabis and other exocannabinoids as anecdotal treatments for various GI disorders inspired the search for mechanisms by which these compounds mediate their effects, which led to the discovery of the mammalian endocannabinoid system. Dysregulated endocannabinoid signaling was linked to inflammation and the gut microbiota. However, the effects of endocannabinoids on host susceptibility to infection has not been explored. Here, we show that mice with elevated levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are protected from enteric infection by Enterobacteriaceae pathogens. 2-AG directly modulates pathogen function by inhibiting virulence programs essential for successful infection. Furthermore, 2-AG antagonizes the bacterial receptor QseC, a histidine kinase encoded within the core Enterobacteriaceae genome that promotes the activation of pathogen-associated type three secretion systems. Taken together, our findings establish that endocannabinoids are directly sensed by bacteria and can modulate bacterial function.

Section: Introduction

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract harbors a complex community of endogenous microbes essential to maintain intestinal homeostasis ( Sartor and Wu, 2017 90. Sartor, R.B. ∙ Wu, G.D. Roles for Intestinal Bacteria, Viruses, and Fungi in Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Therapeutic Approaches Gastroenterology. 2017; 152 :327-339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). The metabolic and physiological activities of host and microbial cells generate an intestinal microenvironment with a diverse milieu of small molecules. Invading bacterial pathogens evolved mechanisms to sense many of these chemical cues. They integrate this biochemical information into the regulation of key virulence-associated pathways and signaling networks to successfully colonize the intestine and allow rapid niche formation, replication, and subsequent transmission to the next host ( Bäumler and Sperandio, 2016 6. Bäumler, A.J. ∙ Sperandio, V. Interactions between the microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in the gut Nature. 2016; 535 :85-93 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Intestinal pathogens, such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (CR), colonize the large intestine by attaching to the colonic epithelium, which enables pathogen replication and results in the effacement of the microvilli and actin rearrangement forming pedestal-like structures known as AE lesions leading to the development of diarrhea. AE pathogens harbor a pathogenicity island named the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), which is essential for AE lesion formation. The LEE encodes a type 3 secretion system (T3SS), a molecular syringe that injects bacterial proteins known as effectors into host cells that enables the establishment of a replicative niche ( Knutton et al., 1989 54. Knutton, S. ∙ Baldwin, T. ∙ Williams, P.H. ...

Microbiol. 2004; 2 :123-140 Crossref Scopus (2775) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutants in the LEE-encoded adhesin intimin, components of the T3SS, or key effectors are unable to form AE lesions on epithelial cells ( Deng et al., 2004 23.

USA. 2004; 101 :3597-3602 Crossref Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other enteric pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium also utilize T3SSs to modify their local environment to promote disease ( Barthel et al., 2003 5.

S. typhimurium harbors the Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2, which encode T3SSs that enable intestinal epithelial invasion and intracellular replication, respectively ( Galán and Curtiss, 1989 38.

Specific chemical signals in the intestine modulate the expression and function of T3SSs ( Kumar et al., 2019 57. Kumar, A. ∙ Ellermann, M. ∙ Sperandio, V. Taming the Beast: Interplay between Gut Small Molecules and Enteric Pathogens Infect. Immun. 2019; 87 :87 Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar ). AE pathogens and S. typhimurium sense the host neurotransmitters epinephrine (epi) and norepinephrine (NE) via the bacterial adrenergic receptor QseC, a histidine kinase (HK), encoded within the core genomes of γ-Proteobacteria ( Clarke et al., 2006 15.

QseC inhibition as an antivirulence approach for colitis-associated bacteria Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :142-147 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Epi/NE engagement with QseC activates intracellular signaling cascades that regulate bacterial physiology, behavior, function, and virulence ( Sperandio et al., 2002 94.

The QseC adrenergic signaling cascade in Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5 :e1000553 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). In AE pathogens, QseC activation promotes increased expression of ler , the master transcriptional regulator of the LEE operons ( Clarke et al., 2006 15. Clarke, M.B. ∙ Hughes, D.T. ∙ Zhu, C. ... The QseC sensor kinase: a bacterial adrenergic receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :10420-10425 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the QseC synthetic inhibitor LED209 attenuates the virulence of EHEC and CR ( Rasko et al., 2008 86. Rasko, D.A. ∙ Moreira, C.G. ∙ Li, R. ... Targeting QseC signaling and virulence for antibiotic development Science. 2008; 321 :1078-1080 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ; Curtis et al., 2014 19.

Transcription of the master regulators of SPI-1 and SPI-2 in Salmonella is also activated upon epi/NE binding to QseC ( Moreira et al., 2010 73. Moreira, C.G. ∙ Weinshenker, D. ∙ Sperandio, V. QseC mediates Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium virulence in vitro and in vivo Infect. Immun. 2010; 78 :914-926 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, QseC-mediated sensing of the local intestinal environment exacerbates pathogen infection through the upregulation of virulence programs.
The mammalian endocannabinoid system is composed of lipid-based signaling molecules known as endocannabinoids, which modulate GI physiology and immunity ( Cani et al., 2016 12.

Biol. 2015; 97 :1049-1070 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). The two major host endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), are synthesized through the lipolysis of host membrane phospholipid precursors and then activate their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors CB1 and CB2 to stimulate a cellular response ( Devane et al., 1992 25.

Biol. 2007; 14 :1347-1356 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (735) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent reports showed that lipases encoded within bacterial genomes can also hydrolyze 2-AG in vitro ( Côtes et al., 2007 16. Côtes, K. ∙ Dhouib, R. ∙ Douchet, I. ...

Thus, bacteria may sense and respond to endocannabinoids in the gut environment, which could alter outcomes of infection.

Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 97 :1049-1070 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the effects of endocannabinoids on intestinal infection have not been explored. Here, we report that mice with elevated levels of the endocannabinoid 2-AG exhibit attenuated disease when infected with the AE pathogen CR or S. typhimurium . We further show that 2-AG directly modulates the virulence of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae by inhibiting the activation of the pro-virulence receptor QseC. This dampens the deployment of their T3SSs essential for successful pathogen colonization, replication, and disease causation. Collectively, our findings suggest that the anti-virulence effects of 2-AG on pathogen function contribute to the protection against enteric infection observed in mice with elevated 2-AG.

Section: Results

To establish whether endocannabinoids modulate infectious disease, we investigated susceptibility to infection with the murine AE pathogen CR in mice with elevated 2-AG. The enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (Mgll) degrades 2-AG into arachidonic acid (AA) and glycerol ( Figure 1 A; Dinh et al., 2002 28. Dinh, T.P. ∙ Carpenter, D. ∙ Leslie, F.M. ... Brain monoglyceride lipase participating in endocannabinoid inactivation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :10819-10824 Crossref Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar , 2004 29.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66 :1260-1264 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mgll knockout ( Mgll KO) mice have increased 2-AG levels in various organs including the colon during homeostasis and infection ( Figure 1 B; Schlosburg et al., 2010 91. Schlosburg, J.E. ∙ Blankman, J.L. ∙ Long, J.Z. ... Chronic monoacylglycerol lipase blockade causes functional antagonism of the endocannabinoid system Nat.

Pharmacol. 2015; 172 :4419-4429 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). We infected Mgll KO and wild-type (WT) mice littermate controls with CR to compare the effects of different levels of host 2-AG on intestinal bacterial infection. Mgll KO mice developed significantly attenuated intestinal disease in response to CR infection as assessed by gross pathology at days 7 and 10 ( Figure 1 C) and histology at day 10 ( Figures 1 D–1F and 1H). Crypt hyperplasia, a hallmark of CR infection ( Luperchio and Schauer, 2001 65. Luperchio, S.A. ∙ Schauer, D.B. Molecular pathogenesis of Citrobacter rodentium and transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia Microbes Infect. 2001; 3 :333-340 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ), was decreased in the ceca and distal colons of Mgll KO mice ( Figures 1 F and 1H) where CR attaches to the colonic epithelium ( Mullineaux-Sanders et al., 2019 75. Mullineaux-Sanders, C. ∙ Sanchez-Garrido, J. ∙ Hopkins, E.G.D. ... Citrobacter rodentium-host-microbiota interactions: immunity, bioenergetics and metabolism Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :701-715 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, a larger proportion of Mgll KO mice (85.7% at day 7, 100% at day 10) exhibited mild disease (score of 4 or less) compared to Mgll WT mice (33.3% at day 7, 11.1% at day 10) ( Figure 1 C). The attenuated pathology observed in Mgll KO mice corresponded with decreased colonic expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, including Nos2 , Lcn2 , and Mip2a , which positively correlate with CR disease progression and severity ( Figures 1 G and S1 A–S1C). Moreover, in contrast to WT mice, the expression of these inflammation markers remained unaltered during the course of infection in Mgll KO mice ( Figures 1 G, S1 A, and S1B). These data demonstrate that Mgll KO mice develop less severe intestinal disease in response to CR infection.
We then hypothesized that 2-AG mediates the protective effects against CR infection in Mgll KO mice. However, because other monoacylglycerols (MAGs) can serve as substrates for Mgll , genetic ablation of Mgll may potentially alter the profile of other biologically active lipids in addition to 2-AG ( Nomura et al., 2010 79. Nomura, D.K. ∙ Long, J.Z. ∙ Niessen, S. ... Monoacylglycerol lipase regulates a fatty acid network that promotes cancer pathogenesis Cell. 2010; 140 :49-61 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (614) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, abrogation of 2-AG hydrolysis by Mgll can decrease the generation of AA in certain tissues, which can in turn modulate inflammation ( Nomura et al., 2008 78. Nomura, D.K. ∙ Hudak, C.S.S. ∙ Ward, A.M. ... Monoacylglycerol lipase regulates 2-arachidonoylglycerol action and arachidonic acid levels Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008; 18 :5875-5878 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schlosburg et al., 2010 91. Schlosburg, J.E. ∙ Blankman, J.L. ∙ Long, J.Z. ... Chronic monoacylglycerol lipase blockade causes functional antagonism of the endocannabinoid system Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13 :1113-1119 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ; Long et al., 2009 64. Long, J.Z. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Booker, L. ... Selective blockade of 2-arachidonoylglycerol hydrolysis produces cannabinoid behavioral effects Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5 :37-44 Crossref Scopus (672) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore assessed whether genetic ablation of Mgll alters colon concentrations of AA and other MAG substrates of Mgll. Congruent with previous reports, we found that AA was not increased in the colons of Mgll KO mice, including in mice infected with CR ( Figure S1 D; Nomura et al., 2011 80. Nomura, D.K. ∙ Morrison, B.E. ∙ Blankman, J.L. ... Endocannabinoid hydrolysis generates brain prostaglandins that promote neuroinflammation Science. 2011; 334 :809-813 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ). Colonic levels of other detectable MAGs also remained unchanged in PBS-treated or infected Mgll WT and KO mice ( Figures S1 E and S1F). These data suggest that Mgll deficiency primarily alters colonic 2-AG levels and does not impact the levels of AA or other MAGs in the colon. These findings indicate that elevated 2-AG likely mediates the protective effects against enteric infection observed in Mgll KO mice.
Development of more severe intestinal pathology during infection can occur as a result of increased pathogen virulence potential, which enables enhanced pathogen replication, and can exacerbate inflammation and disease. We then determined whether the attenuated pathology observed in infected Mgll KO mice corresponds with reduced intestinal burdens of CR. Fecal shedding of CR were not significantly different between Mgll WT or KO mice at days 1, 2, 4, and notably at day 7 post-infection ( Figure 2 A). However, by day 10 (peak of disease in this murine model), fecal loads of CR were significantly decreased in Mgll KO mice relative to WT controls ( Figures 2 A and 2B). This difference seemed to be primarily driven by the lack of detectable CR colony-forming units (CFUs) in fecal samples collected from a subset of Mgll KO mice (CR-positive cultures in Mgll WT versus KO: 94.4% versus 57.1% of mice).
We next assessed the extent of CR colonization in cecal and distal colon tissues because both sites serve as replicative niches for CR in the murine gut where consequent tissue damage occurs ( Mullineaux-Sanders et al., 2019 75. Mullineaux-Sanders, C. ∙ Sanchez-Garrido, J. ∙ Hopkins, E.G.D. ... Citrobacter rodentium-host-microbiota interactions: immunity, bioenergetics and metabolism Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :701-715 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mgll KO mice exhibited reduced CR loads in cecal tissues at days 7 and 10 ( Figures 2 C and 2D) and in distal colon tissues at day 10 ( Figure 2 E). As observed in stools, differences in CR colonization of the cecum and distal colon were primarily driven by an increased proportion of Mgll KO mice that were negative for CR by culture ( Figures 2 B–2E). By day 10, live CR was not recoverable from colon tissues in the majority of Mgll KO mice, whereas nearly 100% of Mgll WT mice remained infected ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Moreover, CR was not detectable in the ceca of a subset of Mgll KO mice that continued to shed CR in feces, a phenomenon that was not observed in Mgll WT mice ( Figure 2 F). Sex also seemed to contribute to the variability in CR fecal shedding and tissue colonization observed in Mgll KO mice ( Figures S2 A–S2C). A greater proportion of female Mgll KO mice were culture negative for CR compared to males, which corresponded with a trend toward increased levels of colonic 2-AG ( Figure S2 D). These data suggest that Mgll KO mice with elevated 2-AG clear the CR infection earlier than Mgll WT mice, which corresponds with the attenuated inflammation and pathology observed in Mgll KO mice.
Next, we investigated whether Mgll KO mice, which have chronically altered endocannabinoid tone, showed any overt changes on immune function. Genetic ablation of Mgll modestly alters the basal expression of a few markers of immune function, notably Lcn2 , Il10 , and Il12b , in the colons of untreated adult mice ( Figures S2 E and S2F), which in turn may play a role in modulating the host response to enteric infection. We therefore also employed a pharmacological approach to increase colonic levels of 2-AG in WT mice using the Mgll inhibitor JZL184 as previously reported ( Long et al., 2009 64.

Pharmacol. 2015; 172 :4419-4429 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly to Mgll KO mice, CR cecal burdens were decreased in WT mice treated with JZL184 compared to vehicle controls, which corresponded with attenuated cecal pathology ( Figures 2 G, 2H, and S2 G–S2I). Moreover, as observed with Mgll KO mice, at least 50% of JZL184-treated mice were negative for CR by cecal culture, despite continuing to shed CR in feces at days 7 and 10 post-infection ( Figures 2 G and S2 G–S2I). In contrast, most vehicle-treated mice remained colonized with CR ( Figures 2 G and S2 G–S2I). Notably, JZL184 did not alter CR burdens in cecal tissues or feces and had no impact on cecal pathology in Mgll KO mice ( Figures 2 I, 2J, S2 I, and S2J), which is likely indicative of minimal off-target effects of the inhibitor in our CR infection model. These data suggest that increased 2-AG as a result of Mgll dysfunction attenuates CR infection, which corresponds with faster clearance of the pathogen, and attenuated disease.
Endocannabinoid signaling mediated by 2-AG manifests through the activation of the host cannabinoid receptors CB1 or CB2, which stimulates complex intracellular signaling cascades that modulate GI physiology and immunity ( Leinwand et al., 2017 60. Leinwand, K.L. ∙ Gerich, M.E. ∙ Hoffenberg, E.J. ... Manipulation of the Endocannabinoid System in Colitis: A Comprehensive Review Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2017; 23 :192-199 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Taschler et al., 2017 98. Taschler, U. ∙ Hasenoehrl, C. ∙ Storr, M. ... Cannabinoid Receptors in Regulating the GI Tract: Experimental Evidence and Therapeutic Relevance Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2017; 239 :343-362 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, chronic blockade of Mgll results in the desensitization of the CB1 receptor in the gut ( Schlosburg et al., 2010 91. Schlosburg, J.E. ∙ Blankman, J.L. ∙ Long, J.Z. ...

Neurosci. 2010; 13 :1113-1119 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ; Taschler et al., 2015 97. Taschler, U. ∙ Eichmann, T.O. ∙ Radner, F.P.W. ...

Pharmacol. 2015; 172 :4419-4429 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, because 2-AG seems to primarily modulate immune function through its interactions with CB2 to impart its anti-inflammatory effects ( Turcotte et al., 2016 100. Turcotte, C. ∙ Blanchet, M.-R. ∙ Laviolette, M. ... The CB 2 receptor and its role as a regulator of inflammation Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 73 :4449-4470 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reasoned that 2-AG may attenuate infectious disease by activating CB2 receptors. To address this, we next investigated whether CB2 blockade with the inhibitor AM630 can reverse the protective effects of JZL184 observed with CR infection. CR fecal shedding, colonization of cecal tissues, and corresponding cecal pathology were all comparable between WT mice that were administered JZL184 or co-administered JZL184 and AM630 ( Figures 2 G, 2H, and S2 G). These findings suggest that the protective effects of 2-AG on CR infection are not mediated through the engagement of the host CB2 receptor.
Because endocannabinoid tone can affect microbiota composition ( Everard et al., 2013 36. Everard, A. ∙ Belzer, C. ∙ Geurts, L. ... Cross-talk between Akkermansia muciniphila and intestinal epithelium controls diet-induced obesity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :9066-9071 Crossref Scopus (1844) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cani et al., 2016 12. Cani, P.D. ∙ Plovier, H. ∙ Van Hul, M. ... Endocannabinoids--at the crossroads between the gut microbiota and host metabolism Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2016; 12 :133-143 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next assessed whether compositional or functional changes to the microbiota may explain the attenuated CR infection observed in Mgll KO mice. Microbiota community profiling revealed that prior to infection with CR, the microbiotas between WT and Mgll KO mice did not significantly differ in composition ( Figures S3 A and S3B). To determine whether functional differences in the microbiota that may occur as a result of elevated 2-AG mediates protection against enteric infection, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments. Germ-free WT recipients were engrafted with the microbiota from Mgll WT or KO donors and then subjected to CR infection. Pathogen loads in feces and colon tissues and corresponding colon pathology did not differ between recipients of the Mgll WT or KO FMT ( Figures S3 C–S3F). Together, these findings suggest that the microbiota unlikely mediates the faster clearance of CR and attenuated disease observed in Mgll KO mice ( Figures S1 E and S1F).
AE pathogens such as CR and EHEC harbor the LEE pathogenicity island that is essential for successful colonization of the intestines and consequent induction of disease ( Figure 3 A). The LEE-encoded T3SS enables AE pathogens to inject their effectors into colonocytes ( Figure 3 B; Knutton et al., 1989 54. Knutton, S. ∙ Baldwin, T. ∙ Williams, P.H. ... Actin accumulation at sites of bacterial adhesion to tissue culture cells: basis of a new diagnostic test for enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Infect. Immun. 1989; 57 :1290-1298 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaper et al., 2004 53. Kaper, J.B. ∙ Nataro, J.P. ∙ Mobley, H.L. Pathogenic Escherichia coli Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2 :123-140 Crossref Scopus (2775) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genetic inactivation of the LEE abrogates the formation of AE lesions on epithelial cells, colonization of the gut, and consequent disease and thus renders these mutants avirulent ( Kaper et al., 2004 53. Kaper, J.B. ∙ Nataro, J.P. ∙ Mobley, H.L. Pathogenic Escherichia coli Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2 :123-140 Crossref Scopus (2775) PubMed Google Scholar ; Deng et al., 2004 23.

USA. 2004; 101 :3597-3602 Crossref Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the transcriptional expression of LEE-encoded genes in CR positively correlates with its in vivo fitness and virulence potential during infection ( Jimenez et al., 2020 52. Jimenez, A.G. ∙ Ellermann, M. ∙ Abbott, W. ... Diet-derived galacturonic acid regulates virulence and intestinal colonization in enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Citrobacter rodentium Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :368-378 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kumar et al., 2020 58. Kumar, A. ∙ Russell, R.M. ∙ Pifer, R. ... The Serotonin Neurotransmitter Modulates Virulence of Enteric Pathogens Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28 :41-53 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore determined whether the attenuation of colitis observed in CR-infected Mgll KO mice corresponds with decreased in vivo activation of the LEE. CR recovered from cecal contents of Mgll KO mice at day 7 post-infection exhibited decreased expression of the LEE-encoded translocon component espA and the effector and intimin receptor tir compared to CR recovered from Mgll WT mice, both of which are essential for disease ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Notably, the decreased expression of LEE-encoded genes in CR recovered from Mgll KO mice precedes the significant reduction in tissue colonization and fecal shedding observed at day 10 ( Figures 2 A–2E). These data suggest the LEE in CR is not activated to the same extent in Mgll KO versus Mgll WT mice during infection.
Because colonic 2-AG levels are increased in Mgll KO mice, we next assessed whether decreased LEE expression in Mgll KO mice may be the result of direct effects of 2-AG on AE pathogen virulence. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to investigate whether 2-AG can alter the pathogen transcriptome in vitro under well-established LEE inducing growth conditions ( Abe et al., 2002 1. Abe, H. ∙ Tatsuno, I. ∙ Tobe, T. ... Bicarbonate ion stimulates the expression of locus of enterocyte effacement-encoded genes in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Infect. Immun. 2002; 70 :3500-3509 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ; RNA-seq accession number PRJEB29880). RNA-seq was conducted in EHEC grown in vitro in the presence of vehicle or of 10 μM 2-AG, which is within the physiological range reported in the human and murine intestines ( Alhouayek et al., 2011 2. Alhouayek, M. ∙ Lambert, D.M. ∙ Delzenne, N.M. ... Increasing endogenous 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels counteracts colitis and related systemic inflammation FASEB J. 2011; 25 :2711-2721 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Di Sabatino et al., 2011 27. Di Sabatino, A. ∙ Battista, N. ∙ Biancheri, P. ... The endogenous cannabinoid system in the gut of patients with inflammatory bowel disease Mucosal Immunol. 2011; 4 :574-583 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2-AG significantly altered the expression of four KEGG pathways, including the bacterial secretion system and pathogenic E. coli infection pathways ( Figure S4 A). Gene-level analyses revealed that these results corresponded with a significant downregulation of numerous LEE-encoded genes including espA ( Figure S4 B). In contrast, few non-LEE-encoded genes were differentially expressed in EHEC in response to 2-AG (RNA-seq accession number PRJEB29880), including the lethal phage-encoded virulence factor Shiga toxin ( stx2a ) ( Figure S4 C). The inhibitory effects of 2-AG on LEE transcription were confirmed by qRT-PCR of representative LEE-encoded genes from its five operons in EHEC and in CR ( Figures 3 E and S4 D). 2-AG did not affect the in vitro growth of EHEC or CR ( Figures S4 E–S4G), suggesting that the inhibitory effects of 2-AG on the LEE are not the result of a decrease in bacterial density. Hence, the host 2-AG inhibits the expression of LEE virulence genes in human and murine AE pathogens.
To functionally confirm the inhibitory effects of 2-AG on the LEE, we next investigated whether 2-AG can inhibit LEE-encoded T3SS activity. In both EHEC and CR, 2-AG significantly reduced EspA and EspB proteins in whole-cell lysates and in the corresponding supernatants ( Figures 3 F–3I), which together indicates decreased EspA and EspB secretion. Because the biological activity of 2-AG is inactivated through its isomerization to 1-AG ( van der Stelt et al., 2002 101. van der Stelt, M. ∙ van Kuik, J.A. ∙ Bari, M. ... Oxygenated metabolites of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol: conformational analysis and interaction with cannabinoid receptors, membrane transporter, and fatty acid amide hydrolase J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45 :3709-3720 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next determined whether 1-AG can also inhibit the LEE. In contrast to 2-AG, 1-AG did not inhibit LEE expression ( Figures 3 J and 3K). Finally, we also tested whether a second ubiquitous endocannabinoid in the gut, arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA), which also contains an arachidonic acid moiety, can modulate the LEE. In contrast to 2-AG, anandamide does not inhibit EspA secretion in EHEC ( Figure S4 H), thus demonstrating the distinct inhibitory effects of 2-AG on the LEE compared to other endocannabinoids. Collectively, these transcriptional and functional studies demonstrate that 2-AG can act directly on AE pathogens to decrease their pathogenicity by inhibiting an essential virulence factor, thus introducing a mechanism by which CR infection is attenuated in mice with elevated 2-AG.
AE pathogens utilize the LEE-encoded T3SS to form AE lesions on epithelial cells. This process can be observed in vitro on epithelial monolayers through the visualization of pedestals—the co-localization of attached pathogens with the polymerization of the epithelial actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 4 B, white arrowheads) ( Knutton et al., 1989 54. Knutton, S. ∙ Baldwin, T. ∙ Williams, P.H. ... Actin accumulation at sites of bacterial adhesion to tissue culture cells: basis of a new diagnostic test for enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Infect. Immun. 1989; 57 :1290-1298 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Inactivation of the LEE in EHEC completely abrogates the formation of these lesions ( Elliott et al., 2000 33. Elliott, S.J. ∙ Sperandio, V. ∙ Girón, J.A. ... The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded regulator controls expression of both LEE- and non-LEE-encoded virulence factors in enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Infect. Immun. 2000; 68 :6115-6126 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the expression and functionality of the LEE correlates with the number of pedestals that are formed per cell, as well as the number of infected cells ( Abe et al., 2002 1. Abe, H. ∙ Tatsuno, I. ∙ Tobe, T. ... Bicarbonate ion stimulates the expression of locus of enterocyte effacement-encoded genes in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Infect. Immun. 2002; 70 :3500-3509 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sircili et al., 2004 93. Sircili, M.P. ∙ Walters, M. ∙ Trabulsi, L.R. ... Modulation of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli virulence by quorum sensing Infect. Immun. 2004; 72 :2329-2337 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). This provides a highly controlled experimental system to test the effects of specific host factors on the virulence potential of AE pathogens. We utilized this approach to test whether 2-AG can inhibit EHEC pedestal formation on HeLa cells. To further remove any effects of 2-AG on epithelial cell function, which may impact susceptibility to EHEC infection, we pre-treated EHEC with 2-AG prior to infection with HeLa cells ( Figure 4 A). 2-AG-conditioned EHEC infected significantly fewer epithelial cells and formed approximately 50% less pedestals compared to untreated EHEC controls ( Figures 4 B–4D). We next assessed whether manipulation of epithelial 2-AG production can also modulate EHEC pedestal formation. We utilized Caco-2 monolayers that express functional 2-AG biosynthetic enzymes and thus produce 2-AG ( Ligresti et al., 2003 63. Ligresti, A. ∙ Bisogno, T. ∙ Matias, I. ... Possible endocannabinoid control of colorectal cancer growth Gastroenterology. 2003; 125 :677-687 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using this system, we investigated whether inhibiting epithelial 2-AG biosynthesis with the diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin (THL), which is an FDA-approved weight loss product known as orlistat or Alli, can modulate EHEC pedestal formation. In monolayers that were treated with the DAGL inhibitor, the percentage of epithelial cells infected with EHEC pedestals was significantly increased at 5 and 6 h post-infection ( Figures 4 E and 4F). These data demonstrate that 2-AG decreases EHEC attachment to epithelial cells and consequent formation of AE lesions that mediate intestinal disease caused by AE pathogens.
Other enteric pathogens such as S. typhimurium also utilize T3SS-based strategies to establish successful infection in the gut ( Santos et al., 2001 89. Santos, R.L. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Tsolis, R.M. ... Animal models of Salmonella infections: enteritis versus typhoid fever Microbes Infect. 2001; 3 :1335-1344 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ). We investigated whether 2-AG can also inhibit T3SS-dependent virulence in S. typhimurium . S. typhimurium harbors two pathogenicity islands, SPI-1 and SPI-2, that each encode T3SSs that confer epithelial invasiveness and intracellular replication, respectively ( Figure 5 A; Galán and Curtiss, 1989 38. Galán, J.E. ∙ Curtiss, 3rd, R. Cloning and molecular characterization of genes whose products allow Salmonella typhimurium to penetrate tissue culture cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :6383-6387 Crossref Scopus (712) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ochman et al., 1996 81. Ochman, H. ∙ Soncini, F.C. ∙ Solomon, F. ... Identification of a pathogenicity island required for Salmonella survival in host cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93 :7800-7804 Crossref Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether 2-AG can modulate SPI-1 activity, we first cultured S. t yphimurium under SPI-1-inducing conditions in the presence of 2-AG. qRT-PCR of representative SPI-1 genes revealed that 2-AG inhibited the expression of the SPI-1 master transcriptional regulator hilD and the SPI-1 effectors sipA and sopB ( Figures 5 B–5D), which corresponded with the decreased secretion of SipA ( Figure S5 A). When cultured under SPI-2 inducing conditions, the presence of 2-AG also decreased expression of SPI-2 genes including the T3SS apparatus protein ssaV and the SPI-2 effector sseF ( Figures 5 E and 5F; Hurley et al., 2014 50. Hurley, D. ∙ McCusker, M.P. ∙ Fanning, S. ... Salmonella-host interactions - modulation of the host innate immune system Front. Immunol. 2014; 5 :481 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, 2-AG did not alter the growth kinetics of S. typhimurium ( Figure S5 B), suggesting that the decreased expression of virulence genes in the presence of 2-AG is not the result of any detrimental effects on Salmonella growth.
We next investigated whether 2-AG can also inhibit SPI-1 and SPI-2-dependent virulence functions in S. typhimurium . Mgll KO mice with elevated 2-AG levels are protected against enteric infection with S. typhimurium utilizing the well-established streptomycin model of Salmonella infection ( Barthel et al., 2003 5. Barthel, M. ∙ Hapfelmeier, S. ∙ Quintanilla-Martínez, L. ... Pretreatment of mice with streptomycin provides a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colitis model that allows analysis of both pathogen and host Infect. Immun. 2003; 71 :2839-2858 Crossref Scopus (610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Streptomycin treatment is necessary for the induction of SPI-1-dependent colon pathology as mice not pretreated with this antibiotic prior to Salmonella infection develop Typhoid-like systemic disease ( Santos et al., 2001 89. Santos, R.L. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Tsolis, R.M. ... Animal models of Salmonella infections: enteritis versus typhoid fever Microbes Infect. 2001; 3 :1335-1344 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ; Barthel et al., 2003 5. Barthel, M. ∙ Hapfelmeier, S. ∙ Quintanilla-Martínez, L. ... Pretreatment of mice with streptomycin provides a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colitis model that allows analysis of both pathogen and host Infect. Immun. 2003; 71 :2839-2858 Crossref Scopus (610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mgll KO mice exhibited modest but statistically significant protection against S. typhimurium infection as assessed by survival rates ( Figure 5 G). However, as expected with antibiotic treatment, fecal abundances of S. typhimurium did not differ between Mgll WT and KO mice ( Figure S5 C). We therefore turned to in vitro Salmonella infection models to assess the direct effects of 2-AG on SPI-1 and SPI-2-associated virulence functions, epithelial invasion, and intracellular replication, in a more controlled manner. Similar to our observations with EHEC, pretreatment of S. typhimurium with 2-AG prior to infection of epithelial monolayers reduced SPI-1-dependent invasion of epithelial cells by approximately 50% ( Figure 5 H). Moreover, addition of 2-AG to infected epithelial monolayers did not further reduce Salmonella invasion, demonstrating that 2-AG pretreatment was sufficient to reduce SPI-1-dependent virulence ( Figure 5 H). With respect to SPI-2-dependent virulence, the presence of 2-AG also corresponded with decreased intracellular survival of S. typhimurium within cultured macrophages ( Figure 5 I). Hence, in addition to its inhibitory effects on A/E pathogens, 2-AG inhibits T3SS-dependent virulence functions in S. typhimurium , therefore demonstrating the broader anti-virulence effects of 2-AG on Enterobacteriaceae enteric pathogens.
Because 2-AG can attenuate the virulence of AE pathogens, we next sought to identify a putative mechanism by which 2-AG exerts its inhibitory effects. The structure of 2-AG is composed of a long-chain fatty acid moiety, arachidonic acid, that is covalently bonded to a glycerol backbone at the sn2 position ( Figure 1 A; Mechoulam et al., 1995 69. Mechoulam, R. ∙ Ben-Shabat, S. ∙ Hanus, L. ... Identification of an endogenous 2-monoglyceride, present in canine gut, that binds to cannabinoid receptors Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50 :83-90 Crossref Scopus (2171) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella , E. coli , and CR, FadL is the only identified long-chain fatty acid transporter and is localized to the outer membrane (OM) ( Dirusso and Black, 2004 31. Dirusso, C.C. ∙ Black, P.N. Bacterial long chain fatty acid transport: gateway to a fatty acid-responsive signaling system J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :49563-49566 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the structure of 2-AG, we therefore hypothesized that FadL may also import 2-AG across the OM. To address this, we tested whether 2-AG modulates LEE activity in an isogenic fadL mutant ( Pifer et al., 2018 84. Pifer, R. ∙ Russell, R.M. ∙ Kumar, A. ... Redox, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism intersect with bacterial virulence in the gut Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E10712-E10719 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), reasoning that a lack of LEE inhibition in response to 2-AG would support the involvement of FadL in 2-AG transport. EspA and EspB secretion were no longer attenuated in the fadL mutant ( Figures 6 A and 6B), demonstrating that FadL is necessary for pathogen sensing of 2-AG. We next attempted to investigate how Mgll KO mice with elevated 2-AG levels respond to infection with an isogenic fadL mutant in CR . However, deletion of fadL rendered CR unable to stably colonize the murine gut ( Figures S6 A and S6B).
In several pathogens, including EHEC, CR, and S. typhimurium , the host neurotransmitters epi and NE are sensed by the bacterial pro-virulence receptor QseC. QseC activation by epi/NE promotes AE pathogen colonization of the gut through the positive regulation of their LEE-encoded virulence programs and enhanced LEE-encoded T3SS activity ( Clarke et al., 2006 15. Clarke, M.B. ∙ Hughes, D.T. ∙ Zhu, C. ... The QseC sensor kinase: a bacterial adrenergic receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :10420-10425 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rasko et al., 2008 86. Rasko, D.A. ∙ Moreira, C.G. ∙ Li, R. ... Targeting QseC signaling and virulence for antibiotic development Science. 2008; 321 :1078-1080 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ; Curtis et al., 2014 19. Curtis, M.M. ∙ Russell, R. ∙ Moreira, C.G. ... QseC inhibitors as an antivirulence approach for Gram-negative pathogens MBio. 2014; 5 e02165–e14 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, epi/NE generally serve as positive signals in mammalian physiology, which are counteracted by the inhibitory effects of endocannabinoids ( Szabo and Schlicker, 2005 96. Szabo, B. ∙ Schlicker, E. Effects of cannabinoids on neurotransmission Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005; 168 :327-365 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore hypothesized that 2-AG inhibits QseC-mediated activation of the LEE as its mechanism of action. To test this, we first assessed whether LEE activity is also attenuated in the presence of 2-AG in qseC isogenic mutants constructed in EHEC and CR. In contrast to the parental strains, 2-AG failed to inhibit the LEE in the qseC mutants as assessed by LEE expression and EspA and EspB secretion ( Figures 6 C, 6D, S6 C, and S6D). Together, these data suggest that QseC may be critical for 2-AG sensing in AE pathogens.
QseC is a HK that autophosphorylates upon activation by epi/NE and then transfers this phosphate to downstream regulators, which initiates complex signaling cascades that ultimately activate the LEE ( Njoroge and Sperandio, 2012 76. Njoroge, J. ∙ Sperandio, V. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli virulence regulation by two bacterial adrenergic kinases, QseC and QseE Infect. Immun. 2012; 80 :688-703 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hughes et al., 2009 49. Hughes, D.T. ∙ Clarke, M.B. ∙ Yamamoto, K. ... The QseC adrenergic signaling cascade in Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5 :e1000553 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we next investigated whether 2-AG acts through QseC to mediate its anti-virulence effects. To accomplish this, we utilized a reductionist approach where purified QseC was reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of labeled ATP and added 2-AG to assess its effects on QseC activity. QseC activation as assessed by autophosphorylation was significantly diminished in the presence of 2-AG, including with the addition of its agonist epi ( Figures 6 E and 6F). To further demonstrate that 2-AG engages with QseC, we introduced the endocannabinoid signaling inhibitor AM251, which antagonizes the host endocannabinoid receptor CB1 ( Gatley et al., 1996 39. Gatley, S.J. ∙ Gifford, A.N. ∙ Volkow, N.D. ... 123I-labeled AM251: a radioiodinated ligand which binds in vivo to mouse brain cannabinoid CB1 receptors Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 307 :331-338 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ). As reported in mammalian cells, the CB1 antagonist prevented 2-AG inhibition of QseC activity in our in vitro liposome system ( Figure 6 G). Notably, 2-AG did not inhibit the activation of CpxA, a non-adrenergic HK that senses indole and serotonin ( Figure S6 E) ( Kumar and Sperandio, 2019 56. Kumar, A. ∙ Sperandio, V. Indole Signaling at the Host-Microbiota-Pathogen Interface MBio. 2019; 10 e01031–e19 Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar ; Kumar et al., 2020 58. Kumar, A. ∙ Russell, R.M. ∙ Pifer, R. ... The Serotonin Neurotransmitter Modulates Virulence of Enteric Pathogens Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28 :41-53 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that 2-AG does not inhibit the activation of other HKs expressed in AE pathogens. 2-AG-mediated inhibition of the LEE is retained in EHEC mutants that lack the non-adrenergic HKs TorS or FusK, the latter of which has also been implicated in regulating the LEE ( Figures S6 F and S6G; Pacheco et al., 2012 82. Pacheco, A.R. ∙ Curtis, M.M. ∙ Ritchie, J.M. ... Fucose sensing regulates bacterial intestinal colonization Nature. 2012; 492 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, these results support a mechanistic model where 2-AG exerts its anti-virulence effects on AE pathogens by crossing the outer membrane through FadL and then engaging with QseC to inhibit subsequent activation of the LEE ( Figure 6 K).
Because 2-AG seems to exert its anti-virulence effects through the inhibition of the provirulence receptor QseC, we investigated whether this interaction contributes to the protection from CR infection observed in Mgll KO mice with elevated 2-AG. To test this, we challenged Mgll WT and KO mice with CR WT or the qseC mutant that is unable to sense 2-AG. As we have previously reported, CR colonization of the gut is attenuated in mice infected with the qseC mutant ( Figures 6 H and 6I). In contrast to Mgll KO mice colonized with the parental CR strain, where pathogen burdens are decreased in feces and in cecal tissues with increased host 2-AG, we observed similar fecal and cecal burdens of the qseC mutant in Mgll KO mice compared to Mgll WT mice ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Notably, the percentage of mice with cecal tissues positive for the qseC mutant by culture were comparable between Mgll WT and KO mice infected with the qseC mutant (both at 62.5%) ( Figure 6 I). While this infection rate is lower than Mgll WT mice colonized with the parental CR strain (94.4%), the rate of infection remained most attenuated in Mgll KO mice infected with the parental CR strain (28.9%) ( Figure 6 I). Similar trends were observed with fecal pathogen shedding ( Figure 6 H). Moreover, the severity of disease as assessed by gross pathology did not differ between Mgll WT and KO mice colonized with the qseC mutant and was not as attenuated as in Mgll KO mice colonized with the 2-AG responsive parental strain ( Figure 6 J). Finally, because 2-AG can impact host neurotransmitter activity and epi/NE exert direct pro-virulence effects on AE pathogens, we assessed whether colonic NE levels differed between Mgll WT and KO mice as an alternative explanation for the decreased CR virulence in Mgll KO mice. We observed that colonic NE was comparable between Mgll WT and KO mice ( Figure S6 H), thus further supporting our hypothesis that 2-AG attenuates intestinal infection through its anti-virulence effects. Collectively, our findings suggest that 2-AG directly attenuates the virulence potential of AE pathogens by inhibiting the activation of QseC, which contributes to the protection against enteric infection by AE pathogens observed in mice with elevated 2-AG. More broadly, our findings establish that host endocannabinoids directly modulate bacterial function, which in turn can impact host-bacterial interactions and the outcomes of GI disease.

Anecdotal evidence linked the use of cannabis and other phytocannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) with alleviating symptoms associated with various GI disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome ( Goyal et al., 2017 42.

Endocannabinoids--at the crossroads between the gut microbiota and host metabolism Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2016; 12 :133-143 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microbiota membership correlate with altered endocannabinoid tone, while abrogation of endocannabinoid signaling is associated with changes to the microbiota ( Geurts et al., 2011 40.

Blockade of CB1 cannabinoid receptor alters gut microbiota and attenuates inflammation and diet-induced obesity Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :15645 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). We built upon this to (1) establish that the ECS also impacts host susceptibility to infection and (2) to introduce and define a bacterial-mediated mechanism that contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of endocannabinoids. We show that mice with increased levels of the endocannabinoid 2-AG are less susceptible to the AE pathogen CR. 2-AG antagonizes the pro-virulence bacterial receptor QseC, inhibiting virulence-associated T3SS functions in mouse and human AE pathogens that are essential for intestinal colonization and disease. Finally, this protection against CR infection is attenuated when pathogen sensing of host 2-AG by QseC is disrupted. Taken together, we introduce a defined host-pathogen molecular interaction by which endocannabinoids impart their anti-inflammatory effects in addition to their established effects on the host.
Genetic ablation and pharmacological blockade of Mgll leads to accumulation of 2-AG in colon tissues ( Figure 1 B; Nomura et al., 2011 80. Nomura, D.K. ∙ Morrison, B.E. ∙ Blankman, J.L. ...

Pharmacol. 2015; 172 :4419-4429 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice with elevated 2-AG are less susceptible to CR infection ( Figures 1 and 2 ). Specifically, increased levels of 2-AG in the host promotes earlier pathogen clearance while minimally impacting its initial establishment. This effect is more pronounced in female Mgll KO mice, which interestingly exhibit a trend toward increased colonic 2-AG compared to males. The sexual dimorphic characteristics of the mammalian ECS has been well established in the brain and reproductive system ( Craft et al., 2013 17. Craft, R.M. ∙ Marusich, J.A. ∙ Wiley, J.L.

Neuroendocrinol. 2016; 40 :101-109 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). To our knowledge, the observation of sexual dimorphism with ECS manipulations in the context of experimental colitis has not been previously reported. Pharmacological blockade of Mgll prior to CR infection recapitulates this phenotype, suggesting that any changes in endocannabinoid or immune tone as a result of lifelong Mgll deficiency unlikely contributes to this effect. From the 11 immune markers investigated in colon and cecum tissues of WT and KO mice, the levels of only three were altered. However, we acknowledge that the small changes in the basal expression of these few immune markers ( Lcn2 , Il10 , and Il12b ) in the colons of Mgll KO mice ( Figures S2 E and S2F) may also contribute to modulating the host response to enteric infection. Future experiments aiming to address this are granted. In both Mgll KO mice and mice subjected to pharmacological blockade of Mgll, decreased intestinal colonization at days 7 and 10 correspond with minimal activation of proinflammatory host responses, such as the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-regulated gene Nos2 compared to uninfected controls, and attenuated histopathology and pathology. This suggests that the increased CR clearance in mice with elevated 2-AG is not the result of an accelerated infectious life cycle as activation of immune responses and tissue pathology would likely be evident at day 7 as CR is cleared from cecal tissues. Moreover, decreased expression of the LEE in CR in Mgll KO mice precedes the biggest differences in fecal and cecal CR colonization between WT and KO mice observed at day 10. Hence, our findings support a model where decreased LEE expression corresponds with reduced intestinal pathology and faster CR clearance in mice with elevated 2-AG.
The extent of LEE expression correlates with the ability of AE pathogens to cause disease ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ). CR mutants unable to sense LEE-activating signals are attenuated. However, several of these mutants are not completely avirulent and unable to colonize the gut ( Curtis et al., 2014 18. Curtis, M.M. ∙ Hu, Z. ∙ Klimko, C. ...

USA. 2020; 117 :12387-12393 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Δ qseC can still colonize mice, albeit to a lesser degree than WT CR. The virulence dampening effects of 2-AG observed when KO mice are infected with WT CR are not observed when these animals are infected with Δ qseC ( Figures 6 H–6J). Finally, antagonizing host sensing of 2-AG through CB2 did not restore disease severity in mice subjected to chronic Mgll inhibition ( Figures 2 G–2J). We note that the CB2 inhibitor inhibits the host, but not the bacterial, response to 2-AG, further suggesting that 2-AG also attenuates infection by dampening the virulence potential of the pathogen.
Pathogens encounter a complex intestinal chemistry ( Kumar et al., 2019 57. Kumar, A. ∙ Ellermann, M. ∙ Sperandio, V. Taming the Beast: Interplay between Gut Small Molecules and Enteric Pathogens Infect. Immun. 2019; 87 :87 Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar ). They engage with these signals to gauge the appropriate location and infection timing to deploy virulence programs that maximize their colonization of the gut. AE pathogens sense 2-AG through its inhibition of QseC decreasing LEE expression, gut colonization, and disease. The levels of 2-AG are higher in the small intestine compared to the colon ( DiPatrizio et al., 2015 30. DiPatrizio, N.V. ∙ Igarashi, M. ∙ Narayanaswami, V. ... Fasting stimulates 2-AG biosynthesis in the small intestine: role of cholinergic pathways Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2015; 309 :R805-R813 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). EHEC and CR both colonize the cecum and colon in a LEE-dependent manner ( Kaper et al., 2004 53. Kaper, J.B. ∙ Nataro, J.P. ∙ Mobley, H.L. Pathogenic Escherichia coli Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2 :123-140 Crossref Scopus (2775) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that 2-AG could be a host factor that prohibits the permissiveness of infection by these pathogens in the small intestine. 2-AG levels are regulated by the activities of Mgll and the 2-AG biosynthetic enzymes, which are expressed apically at the epithelium ( Marquéz et al., 2009 67. Marquéz, L. ∙ Suárez, J. ∙ Iglesias, M. ... Ulcerative colitis induces changes on the expression of the endocannabinoid system in the human colonic tissue PLoS ONE. 2009; 4 :e6893 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). To our knowledge, the 2-AG biosynthesis by microbes has not been reported. Thus, 2-AG concentrations are likely highest at the mucosal interface, where the LEE-encoded T3SS is deployed to facilitate pathogen attachment and AE lesion formation. Since mice with elevated 2-AG exhibit faster clearance of infection, it is also possible that 2-AG may serve as a signal for pathogens to initiate their exit strategy to infect the next host. Future studies to investigate the role of 2-AG in infection resolution and pathogen transmission are needed. Thus, one can speculate that in mice with elevated 2-AG, the inhibitory effects of 2-AG override the provirulence effects of NE ( Moreira et al., 2016 74. Moreira, C.G. ∙ Russell, R. ∙ Mishra, A.A. ... Bacterial Adrenergic Sensors Regulate Virulence of Enteric Pathogens in the Gut MBio. 2016; 7 e00826–e16 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus promoting faster tissue clearance of CR. Together, the interplay between NE and 2-AG may serve as local signals for AE pathogens to tightly regulate their virulence-associated T3SSs to successful complete their infectious life cycle. Future studies should define how host NE and 2-AG concentrations fluctuate along the GI tract during infection and impact pathogen-mediated gut colonization and disease.
Finally, our findings also introduce the potential for broader effects of 2-AG in modulating bacterial function. 2-AG also inhibits T3SS-dependent functions in Salmonella including epithelial invasion and intramacrophage survival and lead to a modest increase in survival in Mgll KO mice subjected to the streptomycin model of Salmonella gastroenteritis. However, it should be noted that given the lethality of this model, it is difficult to observe faster clearance of intestinal infection that we observed with CR, the latter of which represents a natural infection model. QseC regulates the expression of SPI-1 and SPI-2 genes ( Bearson and Bearson, 2008 7. Bearson, B.L. ∙ Bearson, S.M.D. The role of the QseC quorum-sensing sensor kinase in colonization and norepinephrine-enhanced motility of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium Microb.

Moreira, C.G. ∙ Sperandio, V. Interplay between the QseC and QseE bacterial adrenergic sensor kinases in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenesis Infect.

Pyroptosis of Salmonella Typhimurium-infected macrophages was suppressed and elimination of intracellular bacteria from macrophages was promoted by blocking QseC Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :37447 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ); hence, it is likely that 2-AG exerts its effects in Salmonella through QseC. Moreover, because QseC regulates virulence in other pathogens ( Rasko et al., 2008 86. Rasko, D.A. ∙ Moreira, C.G. ∙ Li, R. ...

Bacteriol. 2015; 197 :3769-3778 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), it will be interesting to investigate whether 2-AG also inhibits their virulence, particularly in extraintestinal sites of infection. Finally, QseC expression is not restricted to pathogens and is encoded within the core genomes of commensal bacteria. QseC activation by epi/NE regulates other bacterial behaviors such as flagellar motility and contributes to the intestinal fitness and proinflammatory potential of commensal E. coli associated with inflammatory bowel diseases ( Sperandio et al., 2002 94. Sperandio, V. ∙ Torres, A.G. ∙ Kaper, J.B. Quorum sensing Escherichia coli regulators B and C (QseBC): a novel two-component regulatory system involved in the regulation of flagella and motility by quorum sensing in E. coli Mol.

QseC inhibition as an antivirulence approach for colitis-associated bacteria Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :142-147 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, 2-AG may also modulate additional aspects of bacterial function that affect host-commensal interactions and host susceptibility to disease. Modulation of host immune function by 2-AG may be especially important during opportunistic infections by non-professional pathogens, and future studies are necessary to delve into the complexity of these interactions. Taken together, our findings introduce a defined host-pathogen molecular interaction by which endocannabinoids dampen virulence of enteric pathogens in addition to their established effects on the host.

Mgll +/ - breeding pairs were recovered from cryopreservation (Texas A&M Institute for Genomic Medicine) and utilized to generate a mouse colony at UT Southwestern. Genotypes were confirmed using the following primer pairs: Mgll 5′ F7: GGAAACAGGTTTGTCATGGC, Mgll 3′ R1: GCGAGAAACCAGAAGGAGAC. C57BL/6 WT mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All mice were group housed in specific pathogen free conditions at UT Southwestern and maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with unlimited access to water and food (Telkad Global 16% Protein Rodent Diet, Envigo). Unless otherwise indicated, male and female mice at 8-12 weeks of age were utilized for in vivo infections or mock infections with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For all experiments, female littermates were randomly assigned by genotype to experimental groups. Male littermates of the same genotype were maintained in the same experimental groups, as randomization led to fighting and lethal wounds. All animal protocols were approved by the UT Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
HeLa cells and Caco-2 cells were obtained from the ATCC and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco eagle medium (DMEM) medium with 4.5 g/L glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/ gentamicin antibiotic mix at 37°C, 5% CO 2 .
J774.1 murine macrophages were obtained from the ATCC and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Cells were maintained in DMEM medium with 4.5 g/L glucose and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSG at 37°C, 5% CO 2 .
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strain 86-24, Citrobacter rodentium strain DBS100, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains IR715 and SL1344 were grown overnight in Luria bertani (LB) broth at 250 rpm and 37°C prior to subculture for in vitro experiments or mouse infections as described below. Antibiotics were added as appropriate for maintenance of plasmids. All bacteria at stationary phase was mixed with sterile glycerol (25% final concentration) and kept as stocks at −80°C.
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1 . The isogenic mutants utilized in this study and their respective citations are listed in Table S1 and were generated using the lambda red recombinase method ( Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 21.

Deiwick, J. ∙ Nikolaus, T. ∙ Erdogan, S. ... Environmental regulation of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 gene expression Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31 :1759-1773 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ). Where indicated, bacteria were grown in the presence of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, 2-AG (Tocris), 1-arachidonoyl glycerol, 1-AG (Cayman Chemical), anandamide (Tocris) or the vehicle control (methanol at a final concentration of 1:10000).
At 8-12 weeks of age, male and female Mgll +/− or Mgll −/− mice, or Mgll +/+ littermate controls, were orally gavaged with 1 × 10 9 CFU of CR DBS100 or mock infected with PBS in a 100 μL volume. Fecal pellets were collected throughout the course of infection to enumerate fecal pathogen loads by quantitative culture using selective media with nalidixic acid. Feces were weighed, resuspended in PBS, and homogenized prior to plating. At necropsy, colon tissues were harvested to quantify CR burden, for pathology analysis, for lipid analysis and for RNA isolation. Colon contents were collected for quantitative bacterial culture, bacterial RNA isolation, 16S rRNA profiling or norepinephrine quantification. All experiments were performed with at least two independent cohorts and sample sizes are indicated in the figure legends.
Eight to 12-week-old female Mgll −/− mice and Mgll +/+ littermate controls, or C57BL/6 mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory, were utilized for these experiments. Where indicated, mice were chronically administered the Mgll inhibitor JZL184 (Cayman Chemical) by I.P. at 16 mg/kg, once every 24 hours for 5 days, prior to the start of infection ( Long et al., 2009 64. Long, J.Z. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Booker, L. ... Selective blockade of 2-arachidonoylglycerol hydrolysis produces cannabinoid behavioral effects Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5 :37-44 Crossref Scopus (672) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Schlosburg et al., 2010 91. Schlosburg, J.E. ∙ Blankman, J.L. ∙ Long, J.Z. ... Chronic monoacylglycerol lipase blockade causes functional antagonism of the endocannabinoid system Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13 :1113-1119 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Where indicated, mice were administered the cannabinoid receptor 2 inhibitor AM630 (Cayman Chemical) by I.P. at 10 mg/kg, once every 24 hours for 5 days, prior to the start of infection. Mice were administered AM630 or vehicle control approximately 30 minutes prior to receiving JZL184 or vehicle control. The last dose was administered on the same day of infection, approximately 30 minutes prior to gavage with CR . All pharmacological agents were dissolved in DMSO with gentle heating as needed and mixed with Tween-80 and PBS as a vehicle at a final ratio of 18:1:1 (PBS/Tween-80/DMSO). Following these treatments, mice were gavaged with 1 × 10 9 CFU of CR DBS100 or mock infected with PBS. Fecal pellets were collected throughout the course of infection to enumerate fecal pathogen loads by quantitative culture using selective media with nalidixic acid. At necropsy, colon tissues were harvested to quantify CR burden and for pathology analysis. Colon contents were collected for quantitative bacterial culture. All experiments were performed with at least two independent cohorts with the exception of the group co-administered JZL184 and AM630 (1 cohort). Sample sizes are indicated in the figure legends.
Germ free (GF) C57BL/6 mice were maintained in gnotobiotic isolators at UT Southwestern. One cohort of GF female mice at 8-12 weeks of age (n = 6) served as FMT recipients. Eight to 12-week-old female Mgll −/− mice and Mgll +/+ littermate controls served as FMT donors. Fecal pellets were freshly collected from a cage of 4 mice and were mixed in PBS (approximately 1 pellet/200 μL volume). Fecal samples were centrifuged to remove debris. FMT recipients were gavaged with 100 μL of the prepared fecal mixtures under sterile conditions and were maintained under gnotobiotic housing. Seven days following FMT, mice were gavaged with 1 × 10 9 CFU of CR DBS100 to initiate infection. At necropsy, following seven days of infection, colon tissues were harvested to quantify CR burden and for pathology analysis. Colon contents were collected for quantitative bacterial culture.
At necropsy, colitis severity was first grossly assessed, including colon lengths and qualitative assessment of cecal atrophy (0-4), thickening of cecal (0-5) and colon tissues (0-4), extent of content loss in the cecum (0-4) and diarrhea (0-3). Total gross pathology scores are based on a scale from 0-20. For histopathology assessment, the cecal tip and distal colon segments were washed in PBS and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The tissues were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) in the UT Southwestern Pathology Core. Histological inflammation scores of H&E stained colon sections were blindly assessed as previously described ( Gibson et al., 2008 41. Gibson, D.L. ∙ Ma, C. ∙ Rosenberger, C.M. ... Toll-like receptor 2 plays a critical role in maintaining mucosal integrity during Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10 :388-403 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, inflammation was assessed based on the following histopathological features: submucosal edema (0-4), goblet cell depletion (0-4), epithelial hyperplasia (0-4), epithelial integrity (0-4), and polymononuclear (PMN) cell and inflammatory monocyte infiltration (0-4). In the distal colon, the presence and severity of crypt abscesses (0-3) was also assessed. Data are expressed as the sum of these individual scores (0-20 for cecum, 0-23 for distal colon).
At 8-12 weeks of age, male and female WT or Mgll −/− mice on the C57BL/6 background were intragastrically administered 20 mg of streptomycin as previously described ( 19 ). After 24 hours, mice were orally infected with 1 × 10 9 CFU of S. enterica Typhimurium IR715 WT or the SPI-1-deficient mutant, Δ invA . Fecal pellets were collected throughout the course of infection to enumerate fecal pathogen loads by quantitative culture using selective media with nalidixic acid. Severity of disease was assessed by mouse survival. All experiments were performed with at least two independent cohorts. Sample sizes are indicated in the figure legends.
RNA was isolated from cecal tissues snap frozen in liquid nitrogen using the TriZol method (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For CR expression of LEE genes in vivo , RNA was isolated from cecal contents snap frozen in liquid nitrogen using the RNeasy PowerMicrobiome Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For in vitro bacterial RNA isolations, all strains were grown to mid-log or late-log phase as indicated, pelleted, harvested in TriZol reagent and bacterial RNA was subsequently extracted using the RiboPure bacterial isolation kit (Ambion) per the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed in a QuantStudio 6 Flex Instrument (Life Technologies) with Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) using the following PCR conditions: a single hold at 50°C for 2 minutes and at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 minute. Each PCR was performed in 10 μL reactions and contained the following: 1x SYBR green mix and 0.25 μM of each primer. Melting curves were assessed to ensure specificity of the PCR products. Data were collected using QuantStudio real-time PCR software v1.3. The relative abundance of mammalian mRNA transcripts was calculated using the delta delta CT method and normalized to Gapdh levels. The relative abundance of bacterial mRNA transcripts was calculated using the delta delta CT method and normalized to rpoA levels. All in vitro assays were repeated in at least three independent experiments. The oligonucleotides used in this study for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S2 .
Secreted proteins were isolated at the indicated time points following centrifugation of samples as previously described ( Jarvis et al., 1995 51. Jarvis, K.G. ∙ Girón, J.A. ∙ Jerse, A.E. ... Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli contains a putative type III secretion system necessary for the export of proteins involved in attaching and effacing lesion formation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92 :7996-8000 Crossref Scopus (519) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a loading control and added to secreted protein samples. Cell pellets were resuspended in 8M urea to harvest lysate-associated proteins. Proteins were separated by a gradient 4%–15% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and blocked with 5% milk or 5% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20. Membranes were probed with anti-EspA, anti-EspB or anti-Tir primary antibodies, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were exposed using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc™ Touch Imaging System (Software 1.0.0.15) with Image Lab 5.2.1 software for image analysis and densitometry. All secretion assays were repeated in at least three independent experiments.
FAS assays were performed on HeLa cells or Caco-2 cells as previously described ( Knutton et al., 1989 54. Knutton, S. ∙ Baldwin, T. ∙ Williams, P.H. ... Actin accumulation at sites of bacterial adhesion to tissue culture cells: basis of a new diagnostic test for enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Infect. Immun. 1989; 57 :1290-1298 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, epithelial cells were grown to 80%–90% confluency on coverslips in DMEM medium with 4.5 g/L glucose and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Three hours prior to infection, HeLa cells were incubated in DMEM medium with 1 g/L glucose and without serum and antibiotics. Prior to infection, mCherry-expressing EHEC was subcultured in DMEM with 0.1% glucose to mid-log phase in the presence of 2-AG or the vehicle control. Epithelial cells were then infected at a MOI of 1-10, which was confirmed by quantitative plating. Where indicated, 30-min prior to infection with EHEC, Caco-2 cells were treated with the inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin at 10 𝜇 M or vehicle control (methanol, final concentration 1:2000). At the indicated time points, the samples were washed, fixed, permeabilized and stained with fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled phalloidin to visualize actin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize DNA. The coverslips were then mounted on slides and images for pedestal enumeration were taken using the Zeiss LSM780 confocal/multiphoton microscope at the UT Southwestern Live Cell Imaging Core Facility. Pedestal formation was quantified in two ways - as the number of pedestals per infected cell and the percentage of epithelial cells that contain pedestals. Replicate coverslips from at least two independent experiments were quantified.
S. Typhimurium epithelial invasion assays were performed on HeLa cells as previously described ( Finlay et al., 1991 37. Finlay, B.B. ∙ Ruschkowski, S. ∙ Dedhar, S. Cytoskeletal rearrangements accompanying salmonella entry into epithelial cells J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99 :283-296 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, HeLa cells were grown to 80%–90% confluency in DMEM medium with 4.5 g/L glucose and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Three hours prior to infection, HeLa cells were incubated in DMEM medium with 1 g/L glucose and without serum and antibiotics (infection medium). Prior to infection, S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 was cultured in LB medium until OD 600 = 1.0 in the presence of 2-AG or the vehicle control. Epithelial cells were then infected at a MOI of 10 for 1 hour, followed by PBS washes and incubation with gentamicin in infection medium for 1 hour to remove extracellular bacteria. Epithelial cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and intracellular bacteria were enumerated by quantitative bacterial culture. All invasion assays were repeated in three independent experiments.
S. Typhimurium macrophage infections were performed as previously described ( Moreira et al., 2010 73. Moreira, C.G. ∙ Weinshenker, D. ∙ Sperandio, V. QseC mediates Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium virulence in vitro and in vivo Infect. Immun. 2010; 78 :914-926 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, J774.1 murine macrophages were infected with opsonized S. Typhimurium SL1344 at an MOI of 100 for 30 minutes, followed by treatment with 40 □g/ml of gentamicin for 1 hour to kill extracellular bacteria. Macrophages were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 to release intracellular bacteria for enumeration by quantitative bacterial culture. Where indicated, 6 μM of 2-AG and/or the cannabinoid receptor 1 inhibitor AM251 were added to overnight cultures and at the start of infection. All macrophage infections were repeated in three independent experiments.
The histidine kinases CpxA and QseC were purified as previously described ( Clarke et al., 2006 15. Clarke, M.B. ∙ Hughes, D.T. ∙ Zhu, C. ... The QseC sensor kinase: a bacterial adrenergic receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :10420-10425 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Kumar and Sperandio, 2019 56. Kumar, A. ∙ Sperandio, V. Indole Signaling at the Host-Microbiota-Pathogen Interface MBio. 2019; 10 e01031–e19 Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar ). Briefly, E. coli (BL21 DE3) harboring pET21a-CpxA (His-tagged) or pVS155 (pBAD-QseC-MycHis) were grown until stationary phase (OD 600 ∼0.7-0.8). Cultures were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG or arabinose and incubated overnight at 18°C. The bacterial cultures were spun down at 10,000 rpm, 4°C for 30 minutes and the pellets were stored at −80°C until further use. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2% lauryldimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO), 10% glycerol) and protease inhibitor cocktail was added. The lysates were sonicated for 30 s ON and 30 s OFF for 8 minutes at 85% amplitude, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, 4°C for 30 minutes. The supernatants were filtered using 0.22 μm filter tubes. Then, 500 μl of Ni-NTA beads were added to 40 mL of lysate and incubated on a shaker for up to 2 hours at 4°C to allow protein binding to the Ni-beads. The bound lysates were then passed through 5 mL disposable columns twice. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM Imidazole). Proteins were then eluted from the column with elution buffer (50 mM Tris pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole). The eluted proteins were concentrated down using Amicon Ultra 15 Centrifugal Filter Units (10 kDa) and excess imidazole was removed by adding dialyzing buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford assay and were immediately loaded onto liposomes for autophosphorylation assays.
Autophosphorylation assays were performed as previously described ( Clarke et al., 2006 15. Clarke, M.B. ∙ Hughes, D.T. ∙ Zhu, C. ... The QseC sensor kinase: a bacterial adrenergic receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :10420-10425 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). Liposomes were reconstituted with CpxA or QseC as described ( Clarke et al., 2006 15. Clarke, M.B. ∙ Hughes, D.T. ∙ Zhu, C. ... The QseC sensor kinase: a bacterial adrenergic receptor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :10420-10425 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Kumar and Sperandio, 2019 56. Kumar, A. ∙ Sperandio, V. Indole Signaling at the Host-Microbiota-Pathogen Interface MBio. 2019; 10 e01031–e19 Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar ). Briefly, 50 mg of E. coli phospholipids (20 mg/mL in chloroform) were evaporated and then dissolved into 5 mL phosphate buffer containing 80 mg N-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside. The solution was dialyzed overnight against phosphate buffer. The resulting liposome suspension underwent freeze/thaw cycles in liquid N 2 . The liposomes were stored at −80°C until further use. The liposomes (1 mL) were destabilized by the addition of 5.8 mg dodecylmaltoside, followed by addition of CpxA-His or QseC-His at a ratio of 40:1 and stirring at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then 58 mg of Biobeads were added to remove the detergent and the resulting solution was allowed to incubate at 4°C overnight. The supernatant was then incubated with fresh Biobeads (58 mg) for 1 hour. The resulting liposomes containing the reconstituted His-tagged proteins were used for autophosphorylation experiments. The initiate the autophosphorylation assay, 10 μL of the liposomes reconstituted with the His-tagged protein were adjusted to 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT, and then, one of the following signals was added: 10 μM 2-AG, 50 μM epinephrine,10 μM of the cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist AM251, 8 μM arachidonic acid, 500 μM indole, or the vehicle control. The resulting mixtures were then rapidly frozen in liquid N2 and thawed, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 hour and then addition of 0.25 μL [γ32P] ATP to each reaction. At each time point, 2 μL of 5X SDS loading buffer was added to stop the reactions. The samples were then run on 12% SDS-PAGE according to standard procedures and visualized using a phosphoimager (Typhoon FLA 9500, GE).
RNA isolated from four biological replicates was used for RNaseq analysis. Samples were sequenced at the UT Southwestern Medical Center Genomics and Microarray Core. RNA libraries were prepared using Illumina ScriptSeq Complete Kit for bacteria. RNA libraries were run on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer with SE-50. To analyze the data, reads were trimmed, decontaminated and quality-filtered using BBmap software suite. Reads were mapped to the Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933 genome using Bowtie2. Number of reads of each gene was determined using the featureCounts package and differential expression was analyzed using DESeq2. The accession number for the data is PRJEB29880 at the European Nucleotide Archive.
Genomic DNA was isolated from feces collected from female Mgll WT or KO littermates at ages 5 and 8 weeks of age (n = 4 per group) for 16S rRNA microbiota profiling. The hypervariable region V3 & V4 of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene were captured using the Illumina Nextera protocol. A single amplicon of about 460 bp was amplified using the 16 S Forward Primer 5′ TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and the 16 S Reverse Primer 5′ GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC as described in the Illumina protocol. The PCR product were cleaned using Agencourt AmpureXP beads from Beckman Counter Genomics. Illumina adaptor and barcode sequences were ligated to the amplicons in order to attach them to MiSeqDx flow cell and for multiplexing. Quality and quantity of each sequencing library was assessed using Bioanlyzer and picogreen measurements, respectively. About 6 pM of pooled libraries was loaded onto a MiSeqDX flow cell and sequenced using PE300 (Paired end 300 bp) v3 kit. Raw fastq files were demultiplexed based on unique barcodes and assessed for quality. Samples with more than 50 K QC pass sequencing reads were used for downstream 16 S operational taxonomic units (OTU) analysis. The accession number for the raw fastq files is pending at the NCBI SRA database.
Taxonomic classification and OTU abundance analysis was done using CLC Bio microbial genomics module ( https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/plugins/clc-microbial-genomics-module/ ). Individual sample reads were annotated with the Greengene database and taxonomic features were determined. Alpha and beta diversity analysis was done to understand the within and between sample diversity, respectively. Abundance data was used for numeric Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in SVS, Golden Helix Software.
Distal colon samples were collected for lipid analysis from PBS mock-infected or CR infected (3 days post infection) male and female Mgll WT, HET or KO littermates at 8-12 weeks of age. Sample sizes are indicated in the figure legends. All solvents utilized for lipid analysis were either HPLC or LC/MS grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All lipid extractions were performed in 16 × 100 mm glass tubes with PTFE-lined caps (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA, USA). Glass Pasteur pipettes and solvent-resistant plasticware pipette tips (Mettler-Toledo) were used to minimize leaching of polymers and plasticizers. Approximately 100 mg of tissue was weighed and added to 1 mL of methanol/dichloromethane (1:2, v/v) in a 2.0-mL pre-filled Bead Ruptor tube (2.8 mm ceramic beads, Omni International). Tissue was homogenized with a Bead Ruptor (Omni International) for 50 s (5.5 mps, 3 cycles, 10 s/cycle, 5 s dwell time). The homogenates were transferred to glass tubes and diluted to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL using methanol/dichloromethane (1:2, v/v).
Fatty acid profiles were generated by a modified GC-MS method previously described by ( Quehenberger et al., 2011 85. Quehenberger, O. ∙ Armando, A.M. ∙ Dennis, E.A. High sensitivity quantitative lipidomics analysis of fatty acids in biological samples by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1811 :648-656 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 0.5 mg of tissue homogenate was transferred to a glass tube where 1 mL of MeOH with 50 mM HCl, 1 mL of water, 1 mL of iso-octane, and 100 μL of 0.5 μg/mL of FA(20:4 ω6{ 2 H 8 }) fatty acid standard in methanol were added. The mixture was vortexed for 5 minutes in a tube shaker and centrifuged at 2671 × g for an additional 5 minutes. The organic phase was collected to a fresh glass tube. The procedure was repeated two times and the organic phases collected were pooled together and dried under N 2. Dried lipid extract was resuspended in 50 μL of 1% triethylamine in acetone, and derivatized with 50 μL of 1% pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) in acetone at room temperature for 25 minutes in capped glass tubes. Solvents were dried under N 2 , and samples were resuspended in 500 μL of isooctane. Samples were analyzed using an Agilent 7890/5975C (Santa Clara, CA, USA) by electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) equipped with a DB-5MS column (40 m х 0.180 mm with 0.18 μm film thickness) from Agilent. Hydrogen (carrier gas) flow rate was 1.6 mL/min and injection port temperature was set at 300°C. Sample injection volume was 1 μL. Initial oven temperature was set at 150°C, and then increased to 200°C at a 25°C/min, followed by an increase of 8°C/minute until a temperature of 300°C was reached and held for 2.2 minutes, for a total run time was 16.7 minutes. Fatty acids were analyzed in selected ion monotoring (SIM) mode. The FA data was normalized to the internal standard. Data was processed using MassHunter software (Agilent).
Aliquots equivalent to 0.5 mg of homogenized tissue were transferred to fresh glass tubes for liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). The samples were dried under N 2 and extracted by Bligh/Dyer ( Bligh and Dyer, 1959 10. Bligh, E.G. ∙ Dyer, W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37 :911-917 Crossref Scopus (39325) PubMed Google Scholar ); 1 mL each of chloroform, methanol, and water were added to a glass tube containing the sample. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 2671 × g for 5 minutes, resulting in two distinct liquid phases. The organic phase was collected to a fresh glass tube with a Pasteur pipette and dried under N 2 . Samples were resuspended in Hexane. The monoacylglycerols were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a SCIEX QTRAP 6500 + equipped with a Shimadzu LC-30AD (Kyoto, Japan) HPLC system and a 150 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm Supelco Ascentis silica column (Bellefonte, PA, USA). Samples were injected at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min at 2.5% solvent B (methyl tert-butyl ether) and 97.5% Solvent A (Hexane). Solvent B is increased to 5% during 3 minutes and then to 60% over 6 minutes. Solvent B is decreased to 0% during 30 s while Solvent C (90:10 (v/v) isopropanol-water) is set up at 20% and increased to 40% during the following 11 minutes. Solvent C is increased to 50% during 6 minutes. The system was held at 50% of solvent C during 5 minutes prior to re-equilibration at 2.5% of solvent B for 15 minutes. Solvent D (95:5 (v/v) acetonitrile-water with 10 mM ammonium acetate) was infused post-column at 0.03mL/min. Column oven temperature was set to 25°C. Data was acquired in positive mode in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of the m/z transitions 379.3→287.3, 331.3→239.2, 359.3→264.2, 357.3→265.2, 355.3→263.2, 387.2→295.2, 383.3→291.2, 381,3→289.2 and 403.4→311.2. The LC-MS data was analyzed using MultiQuant software (SCIEX). Electrospray ionization source parameters were, GS1 40, Cur 20, temperature 150°C, declustering potential 60, and collision energy 25. GS1 and 2 were zero-grade air while Cur and CAD gas was nitrogen.
Cecal contents were collected from 8-12-week old Mgll WT or KO mice at sacrifice. The samples were then frozen immediately at −80°C and subjected to processing as described ( Wojnicz et al., 2016 103. Wojnicz, A. ∙ Avendaño Ortiz, J. ∙ Casas, A.I. ... Simultaneous determination of 8 neurotransmitters and their metabolite levels in rat brain using liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry: Application to the murine Nrf2 model of depression Clin. Chim. Acta. 2016; 453 :174-181 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the samples were homogenized for protein precipitation in an ice-cold solution containing 75% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid and 0.2 μM of the internal standard (DL-Norepinephrine hydrochloride) in a 4:1 proportion (solvent:cecum content). The samples were then centrifugated at high speed (∼17000 g ) for 40 minutes at 4°C. 200 μL of the supernatant were collected, evaporated to dryness at 45°C, resuspended in 100 μL of mobile phase (95:5, 0.2%formic acid:acetonitrile) and injected directly into the LC-MS-MS apparatus (Triple Quad 6500, Sciex) for analysis.
The statistical tests, definition of center, dispersion and precision measures and sample sizes are indicated within each figure legend. Generally, P- values were calculated using Student’s t test when 2 experimental groups were compared and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison post test when 3 or more experimental groups were compared. All enumeration of bacteria by serial dilution and plating was log transformed to normalize the data. For microscopy, histology and pathology analyses, p-value s were calculated using Mann-Whitney when 2 experimental groups were compared and Kruskal-Wallis test with the Dunn’s post test when 3 or more experimental groups were compared. Statistics for survival analysis was calculated using the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. For all experiments with mice, the collected data was subject to normality tests (Anderson-Darling, D’Agostino, Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov)to determine the appropriate use of parametric or non-parametric statistical tests. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were performed using Prism 8 version 8.4.2 (GraphPad Software, LLC). Statistical significance was defined as follows: ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
