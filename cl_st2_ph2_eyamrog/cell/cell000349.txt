Title: SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 and P.1 escape from neutralizing antibodies


Abstract: Summary

The global spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is devastating health systems and economies worldwide. Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of all variants into human cells is susceptible to blockade by the entry inhibitors soluble ACE2, Camostat, EK-1, and EK-1-C4. In contrast, entry of the B.1.351 and P.1 variant was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, entry of these variants was less efficiently inhibited by plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients and sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may escape neutralizing antibody responses, which has important implications for efforts to contain the pandemic.

Section: Introduction

The pandemic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is ravaging economies and health systems worldwide and has caused more than 2.3 million deaths ( WHO, 2020 49. WHO Weekly epidemiological update - 9 February 2021 2020 https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---9-february-2021 Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus, uses its envelope protein spike (S) to enter target cells, and the viral and cellular factors involved in cell entry constitute targets for antiviral intervention.
Host cell entry depends on S protein binding to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and S protein priming by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 ( Hoffmann et al., 2020b 23.

The suitability of these agents for COVID-19 treatment is currently being evaluated within clinical trials. Further, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the main target for neutralizing antibodies, and several recombinant neutralizing antibodies have been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 treatment ( Baum et al., 2020a 3.

Finally, protective mRNA- and vector-based vaccines encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein have been approved for human use and are considered key to the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic ( Baden et al., 2021 1.

The genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 has remained relatively stable after the detection of the first cases in Wuhan, China, in the winter season of 2019. The only exception was a D614G change in the viral S protein that became dominant early in the pandemic and that has been associated with increased transmissibility ( Korber et al., 2020 30.

In contrast, D614G has only a moderate impact on SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by sera from COVID-19 patients and by sera from vaccinated individuals ( Korber et al., 2020 30.

In the recent weeks, several SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged that seem to exhibit increased transmissibility. These variants harbor mutations in the viral S protein that may compromise immune control, raising concerns that the rapid spread of these variants might undermine current efforts to control the pandemic.
The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 (UK variant), also termed variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 or 20I/501Y.V1, emerged in the United Kingdom and was associated with a surge of COVID-19 cases ( Kidd et al., 2021 27.

Subsequently, spread of the B.1.1.7 variant in other countries was reported ( Claro et al., 2021 14. Claro, I.M. ∙ da Silva Sales, F.C. ∙ Ramundo, M.S. ...

It harbors nine mutations in the S protein, six of which are located in the surface unit of the S protein, S1, and three are found in the transmembrane unit, S2 ( Figure 1 ). Exchange N501Y is located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a domain within S1 that interacts with ACE2, and its presence was linked to increased human-human transmissibility ( Leung et al., 2021 31.

CDC Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants 2021 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/scientific-brief-emerging-variants.html Google Scholar ). However, it is largely unclear how the mutations present in the S proteins of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 impact host cell interactions and susceptibility to entry inhibitors and antibody-mediated neutralization.
Here, we show that the S protein of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants mediate robust entry into human cell lines and that entry is blocked by soluble ACE2 (sACE2), protease inhibitors active against TMPRSS2, and membrane fusion inhibitors. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies with EUA for COVID-19 treatment partially or completely failed to inhibit entry driven by the S proteins of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants. Similarly, these variants were less efficiently inhibited by convalescent plasma and sera from individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 and P.1 can evade inhibition by neutralizing antibodies.

Section: Results

We first investigated whether the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT) (Wuhan-1 isolate with D614G exchange), B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants ( Figure 1 ) mediated robust entry into cell lines. For this, we used a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vector pseudotyped with the respective S proteins ( Figure S1 A). This system faithfully mimics key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, including ACE2 engagement, priming of the S protein by TMPRSS2, and antibody-mediated neutralization ( Hoffmann et al., 2020b 23.

Med. 2020; 217 :e20201181 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The following cell lines are frequently used for SARS-CoV-2 research and were employed as target cells in our study: the African green monkey kidney cell line Vero, Vero cells engineered to express TMPRSS2, the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T, 293T cells engineered to express ACE2, the human lung cell line Calu-3, and the human colon cell line Caco-2. All cell lines tested express endogenous ACE2. In addition, Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells express endogenous TMPRSS2 ( Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al., 2011 6.

All S proteins studied were robustly expressed and mediated formation of syncytia in transfected cells ( Figure 2 A). Entry into all cell lines was readily detectable ( Figure 2 B; Figure S1 B). Particles bearing the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants entered 293T (P.1) and 293T-ACE2 (B.1.351 and P.1) cells with slightly reduced efficiency as compared to particles bearing WT S protein, while the reverse observation was made for Calu-3 cells (B.1.351). For the remaining cell lines, no significant differences in entry efficiency were observed ( Figure 2 B). Collectively, these results indicate that the mutations present in the S proteins of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants are compatible with robust entry into human cells.
The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 drives cell-cell fusion resulting in the formation of syncytia, and this process might contribute to viral pathogenesis ( Buchrieser et al., 2021 9. Buchrieser, J. ∙ Dufloo, J. ∙ Hubert, M. ... Syncytia formation by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells EMBO J. 2021; 40 :e107405 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). We employed a cell-cell fusion assay to determine whether the S proteins of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants drive fusion with human cells. For this, the S proteins were expressed in effector cells, which were subsequently mixed with target cells engineered to express ACE2 alone or in conjunction with TMPRSS2. The S protein of SARS-CoV was included as control. The SARS-CoV S protein failed to mediate fusion with target cells expressing only ACE2 but efficiently drove fusion with cells coexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ( Figures 3 A and 3B), as expected ( Hoffmann et al., 2020a 22. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Pöhlmann, S. A Multibasic Cleavage Site in the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Is Essential for Infection of Human Lung Cells Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :779-784.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1211) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein mediated efficient membrane fusion in the absence of TMPRSS2 expression in target cells ( Figures 3 A and 3B), again in keeping with expectations ( Hoffmann et al., 2020a 22. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Pöhlmann, S. A Multibasic Cleavage Site in the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Is Essential for Infection of Human Lung Cells Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :779-784.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the S proteins of all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested facilitated cell-cell fusion with similar (B.1.1.7) or slightly reduced (B.1.351 and P.1) efficiency as compared to WT S protein ( Figures 3 A and 3B).
We next investigated whether the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants showed altered stability, which may contribute to the alleged increased transmissibility of the viral variants. For this, we incubated S protein-bearing particles for different time intervals at 33°C, a temperature that is present in the nasal cavity, and subsequently assessed their capacity to enter target cells. The efficiency of cell entry markedly decreased upon incubation of particles at 33°C for more than 8 h, but no appreciable differences were observed between particles bearing S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 WT or variants ( Figure 4 A).
Although the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants did not differ markedly from WT S protein regarding stability and entry efficiency, they might mediate entry with different kinetics as compared to WT S protein. To investigate this possibility, we incubated target cells with S protein-bearing particles for the indicated time intervals, removed unbound virus by washing, and universally determined entry efficiency at 24 h post inoculation. Entry efficiency increased with the time available for particle adsorption to cells, but no differences were observed between particles bearing WT S protein or S protein from SARS-CoV-2 variants ( Figure 4 B). Confirmation of the results with lung cells is pending. However, the data available at present indicate that there might be no major differences between WT SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 regarding S protein stability and entry kinetics.
sACE2 blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells and is in clinical development for COVID-19 therapy ( Monteil et al., 2020 33. Monteil, V. ∙ Kwon, H. ∙ Prado, P. ... Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Engineered Human Tissues Using Clinical-Grade Soluble Human ACE2 Cell. 2020; 181 :905-913.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1615) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the clinically proven protease inhibitors Camostat and Nafamostat block TMPRSS2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, and their potential for COVID-19 treatment is currently being assessed ( Hoffmann et al., 2020b 23. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor Cell. 2020; 181 :271-280.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13640) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020c 24. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Schroeder, S. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ... Nafamostat Mesylate Blocks Activation of SARS-CoV-2: New Treatment Option for COVID-19 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2020; 64 e00754-20 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the membrane fusion inhibitor EK-1 and its optimized lipid-conjugated derivative EK-1-C4 block SARS-CoV-2 entry by preventing conformational rearrangements in the S protein that are required for membrane fusion ( Xia et al., 2020 50. Xia, S. ∙ Liu, M. ∙ Wang, C. ... Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV) infection by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion Cell Res. 2020; 30 :343-355 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ). We asked whether entry driven by the S proteins of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants can be blocked by these inhibitors. All inhibitors were found to be active, although entry mediated by the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants was slightly less sensitive to blockade by sACE2 as compared to WT S protein ( Figure 5 ). In addition, entry driven by the S protein of the P.1 variant was slightly more sensitive to blockade by EK-1 and EK-1-C4 as compared to the other S proteins tested ( Figure 5 ). These results suggest that sACE2, TMPRSS2 inhibitors, and membrane fusion inhibitors will be active against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants.
A cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (REGN-COV2, consisting of Casirivimab and Imdevimab) and the monoclonal antibody Bamlanivimab block SARS-CoV-2 WT infection ( Figure S2 ) and have received EUA for COVID-19 therapy. We analyzed whether these antibodies can inhibit entry driven by the S proteins of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants. Entry driven by the S proteins of all variants was comparably inhibited by Imdevimab, while entry driven by the S proteins of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants was partially resistant against Casirivimab ( Figure 6 ). A cocktail of both antibodies (REGN-COV2) efficiently inhibited entry mediated by the S proteins of all variants. Finally, entry mediated by the S proteins of the B.1.351 and P.1 variant was completely resistant to REGN10989 and Bamlanivimab, while the S protein of the B.1.1.7 variant was efficiently blocked by all antibodies tested ( Figure 6 ). Collectively, these data indicate that single antibodies with EUA might provide incomplete (Casirivimab) or no (Bamlanivimab) protection against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants.
SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce the production of neutralizing antibodies, and these antibodies are believed to contribute to protection from reinfection ( Rodda et al., 2020 40. Rodda, L.B. ∙ Netland, J. ∙ Shehata, L. ... Functional SARS-CoV-2-Specific Immune Memory Persists after Mild COVID-19 Cell. 2020; 184 :169-183.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wajnberg et al., 2020 46. Wajnberg, A. ∙ Amanat, F. ∙ Firpo, A. ... Robust neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection persist for months Science. 2020; 370 :1227-1230 Crossref Scopus (808) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it is important to elucidate whether B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants are efficiently neutralized by antibody responses in convalescent COVID-19 patients. We addressed this question using plasma collected from COVID-19 patients undergoing intensive care at Göttingen University Hospital, Germany ( Table S1 ). The plasma samples had been pre-screened for neutralizing activity against WT S protein, and a plasma sample with no neutralizing activity was included as negative control. Spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Germany was very limited at the time of sample collection, indicating that serum antibodies were induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 WT infection.
All plasma samples with known neutralizing activity (ID15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 27, 33, 51) efficiently reduced entry driven by WT S protein, while the control plasma (ID16) was inactive ( Figure 7 A; Figure S3 ). Blockade of entry driven by the S protein of the B.1.1.7 variant was slightly less efficient ( Figure 7 A; Figure S3 ). In contrast, seven out of nine plasma samples inhibited entry driven by the S proteins of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants less efficiently as compared to entry driven by WT S protein. These results suggest that individuals previously infected with WT SARS-CoV-2 might only be partially protected against infection with B.1.351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2.
The vaccine BNT162b2 is based on an mRNA that encodes for the viral S protein and is highly protective against COVID-19 ( Polack et al., 2020 38. Polack, F.P. ∙ Thomas, S.J. ∙ Kitchin, N. ... Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :2603-2615 Crossref Scopus (9717) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the S protein harbors T cell epitopes ( Grifoni et al., 2020 18. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ... Targets of T Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus in Humans with COVID-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals Cell. 2020; 181 :1489-1501.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2560) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peng et al., 2020 36. Peng, Y. ∙ Mentzer, A.J. ∙ Liu, G. ..., Oxford Immunology Network Covid-19 Response T cell Consortium, ISARIC4C Investigators Broad and strong memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 in UK convalescent individuals following COVID-19 Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1336-1345 Crossref Scopus (812) PubMed Google Scholar ), efficient protection is believed to require the induction of neutralizing antibodies. We determined the neutralizing activity of sera from 15 donors immunized twice with BNT162b2 ( Table S2 ). All sera efficiently inhibited entry driven by the WT S protein and inhibition of entry driven by the S protein of the B.1.1.7 variant was only slightly reduced ( Figure 7 B; Figure S3 ). In contrast, 12 out of 15 sera showed a markedly reduced inhibition of entry driven by the S proteins of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants ( Figure 7 B), although it should be stated that all sera completely inhibited entry at the lowest dilution tested. In sum, these results suggest that BNT162b2 may offer less robust protection against infection by the B.1.351 and P.1 variants as compared to SARS-CoV-2 WT.

Section: Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a major toll on human health and prosperity. Non-pharmaceutic interventions are currently the major instrument to combat the pandemic but are associated with a heavy burden on economies. Protective vaccines became recently available and might become a game changer—it is hoped that efficient vaccine roll out might allow attainment of herd immunity in certain countries in the second half of 2021. The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 that harbor mutations in the major target of neutralizing antibodies, the viral S protein, raises the question whether vaccines available at present will protect against infection with these viruses. Similarly, it is largely unclear whether antibody responses in convalescent patients protect against re-infection with the new variants. The results of the present study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 and P.1 are partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant against antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment and are inhibited less efficiently by convalescent plasma or sera from individuals immunized with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. These results suggest that strategies relying on antibody-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 infection might be compromised by resistance development.

Rep. 2021; 70 :280-282 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) raises the possibility that these viruses might exhibit altered host cell interactions or particle stability. The present study demonstrates that S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 WT, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 mediate cell-cell and virus-cell fusion with roughly comparable efficiency and entry kinetics. Similarly, particles bearing S protein of WT and variant SARS-CoV-2 did not differ appreciably in stability, although we cannot exclude that examination of more time points might have revealed minor differences. In keeping with these findings, entry driven by the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 WT and variants was efficiently blocked by inhibitors targeting the cellular factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which are critical for lung cell entry. Similarly, membrane fusion inhibitors blocked entry driven by WT S protein and S proteins of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. variants with similar efficiency. These results await confirmation with authentic virus and lung cells, in which entry kinetics might differ. However, the data available at present do not point toward major differences in host cell entry and stability of SARS-CoV-2 and variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.
Although host cell interactions underlying viral entry might not differ markedly between SARS-CoV-2 WT and the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants, major differences in susceptibility to antibody-mediated neutralization were observed. Entry driven by the S proteins of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants was only partially inhibited by Casirivimab (REGN10933), in keeping with mutations present in the S protein of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants being located at the antibody binding site ( Figure S2 ). Combining Casirivimab and Imdevimab (REGN10987) within an antibody cocktail with EUA (REGN-COV2) restored efficient inhibition, suggesting that REGN-COV2 should be suitable for treatment of patients infected with variant B.1.351 or P.1. In contrast, Bamlanivimab ( Baum et al., 2020a 3. Baum, A. ∙ Ajithdoss, D. ∙ Copin, R. ...

This finding is in agreement with the E484K mutation being located in the antibody binding site and suggests that Bamlanivimab should not be used for treatment of patients infected with the B.1.351 and P.1 variants.
Vaccination is key to global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 encodes the viral S protein and is highly efficacious. Closely related vaccines as well as vector-based vaccines followed, and it is believed that these vaccines mainly protect by inducing neutralizing antibody responses. Similarly, neutralizing antibody responses are believed to contribute to protection of convalescent COVID-19 patients against reinfection and disease. The present study showed that entry driven by the S proteins of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants was less susceptible to inhibition by sera/plasma from COVID-19 patients and BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals as compared to entry driven by WT S protein. It should be noted that all plasma and sera tested completely inhibited entry at the lowest dilution tested and that T cell responses will contribute to control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in re-infected convalescent patients ( Grifoni et al., 2020 18. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ... Targets of T Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus in Humans with COVID-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals Cell. 2020; 181 :1489-1501.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2560) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peng et al., 2020 36.

Immunol. 2020; 21 :1336-1345 Crossref Scopus (812) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, the markedly reduced sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization suggests that convalescent and vaccinated individuals might not be fully protected against infection by the B.1.351 and P.1 variants. Such a scenario would be in keeping with preliminary information suggesting that a vaccine based on the S protein might provide less effective protection in South Africa as compared to the United States ( Callaway and Mallapaty, 2021 11. Callaway, E. ∙ Mallapaty, S. Novavax offers first evidence that COVID vaccines protect people against variants Nature. 2021; 590 :17 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). On a more general level, our findings suggest that the interface between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 exhibits high plasticity, favoring emergence of escape variants.
Our finding that entry driven by the S protein of the B.1.1.7 variant can be efficiently inhibited by antibodies induced upon infection and vaccination is in agreement with those of Muik and colleagues, who reported that pseudoparticles bearing the B.1.1.7 S protein are efficiently neutralized by sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals ( Muik et al., 2021 34. Muik, A. ∙ Wallisch, A.K. ∙ Sänger, B. ... Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 pseudovirus by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera Science. 2021; 371 :1152-1153 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Xie and coworkers found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 bearing two mutations present in the S protein of the B.1.1.7 variant (69/70-deletion + N501Y) was still robustly neutralized by antibodies induced by vaccination with BNT162b2. Similarly, neutralization of a virus bearing changes found in the RBD of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants (E484K + N501Y) was moderately reduced ( Liu et al., 2021 32. Liu, Y. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Xia, H. ...

Med. 2021; Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar ), again in keeping with our findings.
We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first side-by-side comparison of host cell entry of variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 and its inhibition by small molecules and antibodies. Although our results await confirmation with authentic SARS-CoV-2, they suggest that evasion of antibody responses does not account for the rapid spread of B.1.1.7. In contrast, our findings indicate that the B.1.351 and P.1 variants might be able to spread in convalescent patients or BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals and thus constitute an elevated threat to human health. Containment of these variants by non-pharmaceutic interventions is an important task.
Our study has the following limitations: we used VSV pseudotyped with the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants to study SARS-CoV-2 entry and its inhibition. Although this surrogate model is believed to faithfully mimic cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, our results await formal confirmation with authentic virus. Furthermore, host cell entry and its blockade were studied using immortalized cell lines, and these analyses should be extended to primary cell cultures within future studies.

Vero-TMPRSS2 cells additionally received puromycin (0.5 μg/mL, Invivogen). A549 (human, male, lung; CRM-CCL-185, ATCC, RRID:CVCL_0023; kindly provided by Georg Herrler), A549-ACE2 and A549-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were cultivated in DMEM/F-12 Medium with Nutrient Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A549-ACE2 cells further received 0.5 μg/mL puromycin, while A549-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were cultivated in the presence of 0.5 μg/mL puromycin and 1 μg/mL blasticidin. Caco-2 (human, male, intestine; HTB-37, ATCC, RRID:CVCL_0025) and Calu-3 cells (human, male, lung; HTB-55, ATCC, RRID:CVCL_0609; kindly provided by Stephan Ludwig, Institute of Virology, University of Münster, Germany) were cultivated in minimum essential medium supplemented with 1x non-essential amino acid solution (from 100x stock, PAA) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 293T cells that stably express ACE2 were generated by retroviral (murine leukemia virus, MLV) transduction and selection of parental 293T cells with puromycin (4 μg/mL for initial selection and 0.5 μg/mL for sub-culturing). Similarly, we generated A549 cells stably expressing ACE2 (A549-ACE2). A549 cells stably expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (A549-ACE2/TMPRSS2) were obtained by retroviral transduction of A549-ACE2 cells and selection with blasticidin (6 μg/mL for initial selection and 1 μg/mL for sub-culturing). Authentication of cell lines was performed by STR-typing, amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase gene, microscopic examination and/or according to their growth characteristics. Further, cell lines were routinely tested for contamination by mycoplasma.

The IFITM proteins mediate cellular resistance to influenza A H1N1 virus, West Nile virus, and dengue virus Cell. 2009; 139 :1243-1254 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1025) PubMed Google Scholar ), yielding pQCXIP_ACE2. For the generation of cell lines stably overexpressing human TMPRSS2 and/or human ACE2 we produced MLV-based transduction vectors using the pQCXIBl_cMYC-hTMPRSS2 ( Kleine-Weber et al., 2018 28. Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Elzayat, M.T. ∙ Hoffmann, M. ... Functional analysis of potential cleavage sites in the MERS-coronavirus spike protein Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :16597 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) or pQCXIP_ACE2 expression vectors in combination with plasmids coding for VSV-G and MLV-Gag/Pol ( Bartosch et al., 2003 2. Bartosch, B. ∙ Dubuisson, J. ∙ Cosset, F.L. Infectious hepatitis C virus pseudo-particles containing functional E1-E2 envelope protein complexes J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197 :633-642 Crossref Scopus (968) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to obtain the expression vector for soluble human ACE2 harboring the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (sol-ACE2-Fc), we PCR amplified the sequence coding for the ACE2 ectodomain (amino acid residues 1-733) and cloned it into the pCG1-Fc plasmid (( Sauer et al., 2014 41. Sauer, A.K. ∙ Liang, C.H. ∙ Stech, J. ... Characterization of the sialic acid binding activity of influenza A viruses using soluble variants of the H7 and H9 hemagglutinins PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e89529 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), kindly provided by Georg Herrler, University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Germany). Sequence integrity was verified by sequencing using a commercial sequencing service (Microsynth Seqlab). Specific cloning details (e.g., primer sequences and restriction sites) are available upon request. Transfection of cells was carried out by the calcium-phosphate method or by using polyethylenimin, Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Transit LT-1 (Mirus).
A549-ACE2 cells that were grown on coverslips were transfected with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with a C-terminal HA epitope tag or empty expression vector (control). At 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution (30 min, room temperature), washed and incubated (15 min, room temperature) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 M glycine and permeabilized by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 solution (in PBS, 15 min). Thereafter, samples were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody (anti-HA, mouse, 1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Next, the samples were washed with PBS and incubated in the dark for 1 h at 4°C with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor-568-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, 1:750, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, the samples were washed, nuclei were stained with DAPI and coverslips were mounted onto microscopic glass slides with Mowiol/DABCO. Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal laser scanning microscope with ZEN imaging software (Zeiss).
Rhabdoviral pseudotype particles were prepared according to a published protocol ( Kleine-Weber et al., 2019 29. Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Elzayat, M.T. ∙ Wang, L. ... Mutations in the Spike Protein of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Transmitted in Korea Increase Resistance to Antibody-Mediated Neutralization J. Virol. 2019; 93 :e01381-18 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). For pseudotyping we used a replication-deficient VSV vector that lacks the genetic information for VSV-G and instead codes for two reporter proteins, enhanced green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase (FLuc), VSV∗ΔG-FLuc (kindly provided by Gert Zimmer, Institute of Virology and Immunology, Mittelhäusern, Switzerland) ( Berger Rentsch and Zimmer, 2011 5. Berger Rentsch, M. ∙ Zimmer, G. A vesicular stomatitis virus replicon-based bioassay for the rapid and sensitive determination of multi-species type I interferon PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e25858 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). 293T cells transfected to express the desired viral glycoprotein were inoculated with VSV∗ΔG-FLuc and incubated for 1 h at 37°C before the inoculum was removed and cells were washed. Finally, culture medium containing anti-VSV-G antibody (culture supernatant from I1-hybridoma cells; ATCC no. CRL-2700) was added. Following an incubation period of 16-18 h, pseudotype particles were harvested by collecting the culture supernatant, pelleting cellular debris through centrifugation (2,000 x g, 10 min, room temperature) and transferring aliquots of the clarified supernatant into fresh reaction tubes. Samples were stored at −80°C. For transduction experiments, target cells were seeded in 96-well plates, inoculated with the respective pseudotype particles with comparable infectivity and further incubated. At 16-18 h postinoculation, transduction efficiency was analyzed. For this, the culture supernatant was removed and cells were lysed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega). Next, lysates were transferred into white 96-well plates and FLuc activity was measured using a commercial substrate (Beetle-Juice, PJK; Luciferase Assay System, Promega) and a plate luminometer (Hidex Sense Plate Reader, Hidex or Orion II Microplate Luminometer, Berthold).
Depending on the experimental set-up target cells or pseudotype particles were pre-incubated with different compounds. Target cells were incubated with different concentrations of serine protease inhibitor (Camostat or Nafamostat, Caco-2, 1 h at 37°C). Alternatively, pseudotype particles were pre-incubated with different concentrations of either sol-ACE2-Fc, fusion inhibitor (EK-1 or EK-1-C4), monoclonal antibodies (Casirivimab, Imdevimab, REGN-COV2 [Casirivimab and Imdevimab], REGN10989, Bamlanivimab), or plasma/sera from COVID-19 patients or vaccinated (Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2) individuals (30 min at 37°C). S protein stability was analyzed as follows. Pseudotype particles were incubated for different time intervals at 33°C, then snap-frozen and stored at −80°C until all samples were collected. Thereafter, samples were thawed, inoculated onto target cells, and the cells incubated as described above. For the investigation of the entry speed of S protein-bearing pseudotypes, the respective particles were inoculated onto target cells and adsorbed for different time intervals before the inoculum was removed and cells were washed and incubated with fresh medium.
293T cells were grown in a T-75 flask and transfected with 20 μg of sol-ACE2-Fc expression plasmid. At 10 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced and cells were further incubated for 38 h before the culture supernatant was collected and centrifuged (2,000 x g, 10 min, 4°C). Next, the clarified supernatant was loaded onto Vivaspin protein concentrator columns with a molecular weight cut-off of 30 kDa (Sartorius) and centrifuged at 4,000 x g, 4°C until the sample was concentrated by a factor of 20. The concentrated sol-ACE2-Fc was aliquoted and stored at −80°C until further use.
Sera from individuals vaccinated with BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2 were obtained 13-15 days after the second dose. The study was approved by the Ethic committee of Ulm university (vote 31/21 – FSt/Sta). Collection of plasma samples from COVID-19 patients treated at the intensive care unit was approved by the Ethic committee of the University Medicine Göttingen (SeptImmun Study 25/4/19 Ü). For collection of plasma, Cell Preparation Tube (CPT) vacutainers with sodium citrate were used and plasma was collected as supernatant over the PBMC layer. For vaccinated patients, blood was collected in S-Monovette® Serum Gel tubes (Sarstedt). Subsequently, the plasma and serum samples were incubated at 56°C for 30 min to inactivate putative infectious virus. For convalescent plasma, pre-screening for detection of neutralizing activity was performed on Vero76 cells using SARS-2-S- and VSV-G bearing pseudotypes as control, normalized for equal infectivity.
A549-ACE2 or A549-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were transfected with DsRed expression plasmid along with either expression vector for wildtype or mutant SARS-2-S, SARS-S or empty plasmid. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution (30 min, room temperature), washed and nuclei were stained with DAPI. Next, cells were washed again with PBS and images were taken using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal laser scanning microscope with ZEN imaging software (Zeiss).
293T target-cells were seeded in a 48-well plate at 50.000 cells/well and transfected with Gal4-TurboGFP-Luciferase reporter plasmid (Gal4-TurboGFP-Luc) as well as expression plasmid for ACE2 alone or in combination with TMPRSS2 (7:1 ratio). 293T effector-cells were seeded in a 6-well dish at 70%–80% confluency and transfected with the Vp16-Gal4 expression plasmid as well as expression plasmid for WT or mutant SARS-2-S, SARS-S or empty plasmid. At 24 h posttransfection, effector-cells were detached by resuspending them in culture medium and added to the target-cells in a 1:1 ratio. After 24 h luciferase activity was analyzed using the Beetle-Juice Luciferase Assay according to manufacturer’s instructions and a Biotek Synergy 2 plate reader.
S protein sequences of emerging SARS-CoV-2 S variants B.1.1.7 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_601443), B.1.351 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_700428) and P1 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_792683) were retrieved from the GISAID (global initiative on sharing all influenza data) database ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ). Protein models are based on PDB: 6XDG ( Hansen et al., 2020 19. Hansen, J. ∙ Baum, A. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Studies in humanized mice and convalescent humans yield a SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail Science. 2020; 369 :1010-1014 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ) or PDB: 7L3N ( Jones et al., 2020 26.

LY-CoV555, a rapidly isolated potent neutralizing antibody, provides protection in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), or a template generated by modeling the SARS-2-S sequence on a published crystal structure (PDB: 6XR8 ,( Cai et al., 2020 10. Cai, Y. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Xiao, T. ... Distinct conformational states of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Science. 2020; 369 :1586-1592 Crossref Scopus (734) PubMed Google Scholar )), using the SWISS-MODEL online tool ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ ), and were generated using the YASARA software ( http://www.yasara.org/index.html ).
The presented data either show (i) results from single representative experiment (conducted with technical triplicates or quadruplicates) that were confirmed in at least one additional biological replicate or (ii) average (mean) data from three or four biological replicates (conducted with technical triplicates or quadruplicates).
Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel as part of the Microsoft Office software package (version 2019, Microsoft Corporation) and GraphPad Prism 8 version 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software). Data normalization was done as follows: (i) To compare efficiency of cell entry driven by the different S protein variants under study, transduction was normalized against SARS-CoV-2 S WT (set as 100%); (ii) For experiments investigating inhibitory effects, transduction was normalized against a reference sample (e.g., control-treated cells or pseudotypes, set as 0% inhibition). Serum dilutions that cause a 50% reduction of transduction efficiency (neutralizing titer 50, NT50) were calculated using a non-linear regression model (inhibitor versus normalized response, variable slope). Statistical significance was tested by one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s post hoc test, or by paired student`s t test. Only P value s of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant (p > 0.05, not significant [ns]; P ≤ 0.05, ∗ ; P ≤ 0.01, ∗∗ ; P ≤ 0.001, ∗∗∗ ). Specific details on the statistical test and the error bars (standard deviation, SD; standard error of the mean, SEM) are indicated in the figure legends.
