Title: Widespread Transcriptional Scanning in the Testis Modulates Gene Evolution Rates


Abstract: Summary

The testis expresses the largest number of genes of any mammalian organ, a finding that has long puzzled molecular biologists. Our single-cell transcriptomic data of human and mouse spermatogenesis provide evidence that this widespread transcription maintains DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through a mechanism we term transcriptional scanning. We find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary timescales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions. Collectively, we propose that transcriptional scanning shapes germline mutation signatures and modulates mutation rates in a gene-specific manner, maintaining DNA sequence integrity for the bulk of genes but allowing for faster evolution in a specific subset.

Section: Introduction

It has been known for many years that the testis is the organ with the most complex transcriptome in terms of the number of expressed genes ( Melé et al., 2015; Schmidt and Schibler, 1995; Soumillon et al., 2013 60.

Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis Cell Rep. 2013; 3 :2179-2190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Widespread transcription in the testis has been reported to include over 80% of all protein-coding genes in human as well as in other species ( Melé et al., 2015; Soumillon et al., 2013 60. Melé, M. ∙ Ferreira, P.G. ∙ Reverter, F. ... Human genomics. The human transcriptome across tissues and individuals Science. 2015; 348 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar 91.

Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis Cell Rep. 2013; 3 :2179-2190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain this observation ( Kleene, 2001; Schmidt, 1996 48. Kleene, K.C. A possible meiotic function of the peculiar patterns of gene expression in mammalian spermatogenic cells Mech. Dev. 2001; 106 :3-23 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Schmidt, E.E. Transcriptional promiscuity in testes Curr. Biol. 1996; 6 :768-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Widespread expression may represent a functional requirement for the gene products in question ( Johnston et al., 2008; Schmidt, 1996 45. Johnston, D.S. ∙ Wright, W.W. ∙ Dicandeloro, P. ... Stage-specific gene expression is a fundamental characteristic of rat spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :8315-8320 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Schmidt, E.E. Transcriptional promiscuity in testes Curr. Biol. 1996; 6 :768-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, other organs containing more cell types—such as the brain—do not exhibit such high numbers of expressed genes ( Brawand et al., 2011; Melé et al., 2015; Soumillon et al., 2013 10. Brawand, D. ∙ Soumillon, M. ∙ Necsulea, A. ... The evolution of gene expression levels in mammalian organs Nature. 2011; 478 :343-348 Crossref Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Melé, M. ∙ Ferreira, P.G. ∙ Reverter, F. ... Human genomics. The human transcriptome across tissues and individuals Science. 2015; 348 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar 91.

Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis Cell Rep. 2013; 3 :2179-2190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, recent studies have shown that knocking out many testis-enriched and evolutionarily conserved genes does not cause male infertility in mice ( Miyata et al., 2016 62. Miyata, H. ∙ Castaneda, J.M. ∙ Fujihara, Y. ... Genome engineering uncovers 54 evolutionarily conserved and testis-enriched genes that are not required for male fertility in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :7704-7710 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). The notable discordance between the transcriptome and the proteome in the testis ( Kleene, 2003; Wang et al., 2019 49. Kleene, K.C. Patterns, mechanisms, and functions of translation regulation in mammalian spermatogenic cells Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 103 :217-224 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar 100.

Biol. 2019; 15 :e8503 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) further supports the notion that the widespread transcription does not exclusively lead to protein production, as the central dogma of molecular biology would suggest.
A second hypothesis implicates leaky transcription during the massive chromatin remodeling that occurs throughout spermatogenesis as the cause of the observed widespread transcription ( Necsulea and Kaessmann, 2014; Rathke et al., 2014; Schmidt, 1996 66. Necsulea, A. ∙ Kaessmann, H. Evolutionary dynamics of coding and non-coding transcriptomes Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15 :734-748 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar 81.

Transcriptional promiscuity in testes Curr. Biol. 1996; 6 :768-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this model would predict more expression during later stages of spermatogenesis—when the genome is undergoing the most chromatin changes—in contradiction with previous observations ( Naro et al., 2017; Rathke et al., 2014; Soumillon et al., 2013 65.

Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis Cell Rep. 2013; 3 :2179-2190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, given the high energetic requirements of transcription, one would not expect such high levels of non-functional transcription ( Frumkin et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2015; Lynch and Marinov, 2015 30. Frumkin, I. ∙ Schirman, D. ∙ Rotman, A. ... Gene architectures that minimize cost of gene expression Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 :142-153 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar 43.

The bioenergetic costs of a gene Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :15690-15695 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we propose the “transcriptional scanning” hypothesis, whereby widespread testis transcription facilitates germline DNA repair and ultimately modulates gene evolution rates. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human and mouse testes, we confirmed that widespread transcription originates from the germ cells. We found that spermatogenesis-expressed genes have lower germline mutation rates in the population compared to the unexpressed genes and that the signature of transcription-coupled repair (TCR) on these genes could explain the observed pattern of biased germline mutation rates. Our transcriptional scanning model suggests that widespread transcription during spermatogenesis facilitates a DNA-scanning process that systematically detects and repairs bulky DNA damage through TCR ( Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008; Werner et al., 2015 37. Hanawalt, P.C. ∙ Spivak, G. Transcription-coupled DNA repair: two decades of progress and surprises Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :958-970 Crossref Scopus (625) PubMed Google Scholar 101.

Sci. 2015; 1341 :156-163 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus reducing germline mutations rates and, ultimately, the rates of gene evolution. The set of unexpressed genes in the male germline is not random. Rather, they are enriched in sensory and immune/defense system functions, which have evolved faster in recent human evolution ( Boehm, 2012; Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010; Singh et al., 2012 9. Boehm, T. Evolution of vertebrate immunity Curr. Biol. 2012; 22 :R722-R732 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Flajnik, M.F. ∙ Kasahara, M.

Singh, R.S. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Kulathinal, R.J. Rapidly Evolving Genes and Genetic Systems Oxford University Press, 2012 Crossref Google Scholar ). However, transcription-coupled damage (TCD) appears to overwhelm the effects of TCR in the small subset of very highly expressed genes, which are enriched in spermatogenesis-related functions, implicating a role for TCD in modulating germline mutation rates ( Jinks-Robertson and Bhagwat, 2014 44. Jinks-Robertson, S. ∙ Bhagwat, A.S. Transcription-associated mutagenesis Annu. Rev. Genet. 2014; 48 :341-359 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, our transcriptional scanning model exposes a hitherto under-appreciated aspect of DNA repair in biasing gene mutation rates and evolution rates throughout the genome.

Section: Results

To identify gene expression pattern throughout spermatogenesis, we applied scRNA-seq to the human and mouse testes ( Figure S1 A). The resulting data allowed us to distinguish between the genes expressed in the somatic and germline cells, as well as to reveal genes with dynamic expression patterns throughout the developmental process of spermatogenesis, including mitotic amplification, meiotic specification to generate haploid germ cells, and, finally, differentiation and morphological transition to mature sperm cells ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Hammoud et al., 2014; Sharma and Agarwal, 2011 36. Hammoud, S.S. ∙ Low, D.H.P. ∙ Yi, C. ...

Sharma, R. ∙ Agarwal, A. Spermatogenesis: an overview Zini, A. ∙ Agarwal, A. (Editors) Sperm Chromatin Springer New York, 2011; 19-44 Crossref Google Scholar ).
Principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised clustering on the scRNA-seq data of human testicular cells revealed 19 clusters composed of cells from different biological and technical replicates ( Figures 1 B, S1 B, and S1C; Table S1 ; STAR Methods ). We annotated the 5 cell clusters composed of somatic cells—including Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cells, testicular endothelial cells, and testis-resident macrophages ( Sharma and Agarwal, 2011 88. Sharma, R. ∙ Agarwal, A. Spermatogenesis: an overview Zini, A. ∙ Agarwal, A. (Editors) Sperm Chromatin Springer New York, 2011; 19-44 Crossref Google Scholar )—using previously determined cell type markers ( Figures 1 B, S1 D, and S1E; see STAR Methods ). Excluding the somatic cells, PCA on the 14 clusters of germ cells revealed a continuum suggesting that the order of the cells corresponds to the developmental trajectory of spermatogenesis ( Figure 1 C). Four independent lines of evidence support this inference. First, the order of expression of known marker genes across the continuous clusters matched their developmental order ( Figure S1 E). Second, pseudotime analysis using Monocle2 revealed the same cell trajectory ( Figures S1 E and S1F; Qiu et al., 2017 80. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, RNA velocity analysis ( La Manno et al., 2018 55. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar )—examining the relationship between the spliced and unspliced transcriptomes—further supported the developmental progression during spermatogenesis and also identified the previously reported decline of expression during meiosis and late spermiogenesis ( Figure 1 C; Rathke et al., 2014; Sharma and Agarwal, 2011 81. Rathke, C. ∙ Baarends, W.M. ∙ Awe, S. ... Chromatin dynamics during spermiogenesis Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1839 :155-168 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar 88. Sharma, R. ∙ Agarwal, A. Spermatogenesis: an overview Zini, A. ∙ Agarwal, A. (Editors) Sperm Chromatin Springer New York, 2011; 19-44 Crossref Google Scholar ). Finally, our scRNA-seq data across the developmental program of spermatogenesis showed high consistency with other recently published human testis scRNA-seq results ( Figure S1 G; Guo et al., 2018; Hermann et al., 2018; Sohni et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018 35.

Our scRNA-seq data allowed us to test whether the long-observed widespread gene expression in the testis has contributions from both germ and somatic cells or mainly stems from the germ cells. Examining only germ cells, we found that 90.5% of all protein-coding genes are expressed ( Figure 1 D; STAR Methods ). In contrast, all of the detected somatic cell types collectively express 59.9% of the genes, of which >99% overlap with the germ-cell-expressed genes. Overall, the spermatocytes and round spermatids clusters have the largest number of expressed genes at the single-cell level, far more than that of testicular somatic cell types ( Figure S1 H). We further compared the number of expressed protein-coding genes across multiple developmental scRNA-seq datasets, including that of the human developing brain and another human testis study ( Guo et al., 2018; Hochane et al., 2019; La Manno et al., 2016; Nowakowski et al., 2017; Pellin et al., 2019 35.

Commun. 2019; 10 :2395 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ; see STAR Methods ). Again, we found that testicular germ cells express the greatest number of protein-coding genes ( Table S2 ). This observation is also supported by bulk RNA-seq results across all complex organs/tissues included in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset ( Figure S1 I; GTEx Consortium, 2015 34. GTEx Consortium Human genomics. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) pilot analysis: multitissue gene regulation in humans Science. 2015; 348 :648-660 Crossref Scopus (1808) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, our scRNA-seq results and other analyses support the notion that the widespread gene expression in the testis originates in the germ cells.
To further ask whether specific developmental stages account for the high expression observed, we clustered all human protein-coding genes into six groups, including the unexpressed genes ( Figures 1 D and 1E; Table S3 ). Although no single stage alone accounts for the widespread transcription, we can infer that each sperm cell will have expressed ∼90.5% of protein-coding genes by the end of its maturation.
To test the generality of these results, we repeated the experiments on mouse testes and found that the pattern of transcription during mouse spermatogenesis was broadly comparable to that of human ( Figures S2 A–S2D; Tables S1 and S4 ). In terms of genes expressed across the stages, we found an overall highly conserved spermatogenesis gene expression program ( Figures S2 C–S2E). A combined principal component analysis of human and mouse germ cells further highlighted this conservation ( Figures S2 F and S2G). We also noted that PC2 clearly separates the human and mouse cells ( Figure S2 H), indicating a species-specific gene expression signature between the two species. These genes include metabolic genes, such as GAPDH ( Gapdh ) ( Paoli et al., 2017 72. Paoli, D. ∙ Pelloni, M. ∙ Gallo, M. ... Sperm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene expression in asthenozoospermic spermatozoa Asian J. Androl. 2017; 19 :409-413 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) and FABP9 ( Fabp9 ) ( Selvaraj et al., 2010 87. Selvaraj, V. ∙ Asano, A. ∙ Page, J.L. ... Mice lacking FABP9/PERF15 develop sperm head abnormalities but are fertile Dev. Biol. 2010; 348 :177-189 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ); chemokine gene CXCL16 ( Cxcl16 ); and sperm-motility-related gene SORD ( Sord ) ( Frenette et al., 2006 29. Frenette, G. ∙ Thabet, M. ∙ Sullivan, R. Polyol pathway in human epididymis and semen J. Androl. 2006; 27 :233-239 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 I). Collectively, these results highlight the conserved gene expression of human and mouse spermatogenesis but also identify the divergence between the two species.
We hypothesized that widespread transcription during spermatogenesis could lead to two scenarios ( Figure 2 A): (1) transcription events unwind the double-stranded DNA, leading to an increased likelihood of mutations by TCD ( Jinks-Robertson and Bhagwat, 2014 44. Jinks-Robertson, S. ∙ Bhagwat, A.S. Transcription-associated mutagenesis Annu. Rev. Genet. 2014; 48 :341-359 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) and consequently to higher germline mutation rates and diversity within the population and/or (2) the transcribed regions are subject to TCR of DNA damage ( Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008 37. Hanawalt, P.C. ∙ Spivak, G. Transcription-coupled DNA repair: two decades of progress and surprises Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :958-970 Crossref Scopus (625) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus reducing germline mutation rates and safeguarding the germline genome, leading to lower population diversity. In both scenarios, differences in expression states may contribute to the pattern of germline mutation rates and ultimately lead to differential gene evolution rates.
Public databases have amassed ∼300 million germline variants detected in the human population, providing a rich resource for studying germline mutation rates ( Zerbino et al., 2018 106. Zerbino, D.R. ∙ Achuthan, P. ∙ Akanni, W. ... Ensembl 2018 Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D754-D761 Crossref Scopus (791) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because ∼80% of these germline variants are thought to have originated in males ( Campbell and Eichler, 2013; Makova and Li, 2002 13. Campbell, C.D. ∙ Eichler, E.E. Properties and rates of germline mutations in humans Trends Genet. 2013; 29 :575-584 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Makova, K.D. ∙ Li, W.-H. Strong male-driven evolution of DNA sequences in humans and apes Nature. 2002; 416 :624-626 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), we used the single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) from this dataset to query for germline mutation rates and predicted mutational signatures caused by widespread transcription in the testis (see STAR Methods ; Acuna-Hidalgo et al., 2016; Nei et al., 2010 1. Acuna-Hidalgo, R. ∙ Veltman, J.A. ∙ Hoischen, A. New insights into the generation and role of de novo mutations in health and disease Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :241 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Nei, M. ∙ Suzuki, Y. ∙ Nozawa, M. The neutral theory of molecular evolution in the genomic era Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2010; 11 :265-289 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, we found that spermatogenesis-expressed genes, regardless of the timing of their expression (throughout and following meiosis), generally have a lower rate of germline SNVs, relative to the unexpressed genes ( Figure 2 B). This difference is robust across donors ( Figures S3 A–S3C) and gene-clustering parameters ( Figure S3 D). We also confirmed the observation of lower germline SNV rates using only SNVs detected by the 1000 Genomes project ( Figure S3 E).
Previous results have shown that the density of somatic mutations is negatively correlated with genomic features of open chromatin, likely due to greater DNA repair accessibility ( Polak et al., 2015; Schuster-Böckler and Lehner, 2012 77. Polak, P. ∙ Karlić, R. ∙ Koren, A. ... Cell-of-origin chromatin organization shapes the mutational landscape of cancer Nature. 2015; 518 :360-364 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar 85. Schuster-Böckler, B. ∙ Lehner, B. Chromatin organization is a major influence on regional mutation rates in human cancer cells Nature. 2012; 488 :504-507 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether lower germline SNV rates in the spermatogenesis-expressed gene sets are confounded by transcription-independent DNA repair favoring open chromatin states of the expressed genes, we asked whether the upstream regions of these genes have lower germline SNV rates compared to those of the unexpressed genes. Upstream regions (5 kb) of genes are strongly enriched with open chromatin states in expressed genes, relative to unexpressed genes ( Buenrostro et al., 2013 11. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Giresi, P.G. ∙ Zaba, L.C. ... Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :1213-1218 Crossref Scopus (1534) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, analyzing the germline SNV rates in the upstream regions revealed minimal differences between the spermatogenesis-expressed and unexpressed genes ( Figure S3 F). A similar pattern was also observed for the gene downstream regions ( Figure S3 G). Together, these results indicate that it is transcription itself—not the associated chromatin state—that leads to lowered germline SNV rates in the spermatogenesis-expressed genes.
To further control for differences in gene-family-specific mutation rates, we examined gene families individually according to whether they are expressed (in any stage) or unexpressed during spermatogenesis (see STAR Methods ; Gray et al., 2016 33. Gray, K.A. ∙ Seal, R.L. ∙ Tweedie, S. ... A review of the new HGNC gene family resource Hum. Genomics. 2016; 10 :6 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). For all large gene families (>100 genes) with at least 10 genes in each category, we found lower germline SNV rates in the spermatogenesis-expressed gene group ( Figure 2 C). For example, of the 110 genes with a basic helix-loop-helix domain, 94 are expressed in the germ cells, and the expressed subgroup has an ∼23% lower germline SNV rate in the population as compared to the unexpressed complement (Mann-Whitney test p < 1.1e−3).
We next tested whether this reduction of germline mutation rates in the expressed genes is unique to male germline gene expression profile, relative to that of other cell types. By distinguishing the binarized expression status in both germ cells and testicular somatic cell types, we found that genes expressed exclusively in somatic cells do not exhibit lower germline SNV rates than those of unexpressed genes in the somatic cell types ( Figures 2 D and S3 H; see STAR Methods ). This observation was also confirmed by analyzing gene expression across other human developmental systems, including the developing brain ( Figure S3 I). To study somatic tissues more broadly, we turned again to the GTEx dataset, which has characterized transcriptional profiles across all major human tissues/organs, including testis ( GTEx Consortium, 2015 34. GTEx Consortium Human genomics. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) pilot analysis: multitissue gene regulation in humans Science. 2015; 348 :648-660 Crossref Scopus (1808) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although not at the single-cell level and thus an average measure of gene expression across cell types, testis expression in this dataset still showed a significant difference relative to all other tissues in its germline variant ratio of expressed and unexpressed genes ( Z score = 4.13; Figure 2 E). Interestingly, we found that the ovary transcriptome does not predict such an effect. These results support the second model ( Figure 2 A), in which widespread transcription-coupled repair in the male germ cells lead to lower levels of germline mutation rates in spermatogenesis-expressed genes.
Although we studied the germline mutation rates using SNVs from population-wide whole-genome sequencing (WGS), the observed differential mutation rates may also be influenced by natural selection, particularly in the coding regions. To search for a transcription-dependent germline mutational signature and exclude selection, we restricted our analysis to stringently defined intron regions (see STAR Methods ). We first repeated our analysis on the differential mutation rates across gene clusters using intronic SNVs. We confirmed that intron SNV rates are lower in the spermatogenesis-expressed genes than that in the unexpressed genes ( Figures S3 J and S3K). However, the effect is smaller, suggesting that, in the coding regions, selection also contributes to a lower SNV rate in the spermatogenesis-expressed genes. We used these intronic SNVs in the following analyses to determine the nature of the transcription-dependent germline mutational signatures.
If the reduction of mutations results from a male germ cell TCR-induced process, we would expect an asymmetry between the germline mutation rates of the coding and the template strands in the spermatogenesis-expressed genes ( Haradhvala et al., 2016; Mugal et al., 2009 38.

The asymmetry would be such that the template strand retains fewer mutations, because, in TCR, DNA damage is detected by the RNA polymerase on the template strand ( Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008 37. Hanawalt, P.C. ∙ Spivak, G. Transcription-coupled DNA repair: two decades of progress and surprises Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :958-970 Crossref Scopus (625) PubMed Google Scholar ). To distinguish between mutations occurring on the coding and template strands, we adapted a previously introduced approach for identifying strand-asymmetries in the somatic mutation rate ( Figure 3 B; Chen et al., 2017; Haradhvala et al., 2016 17. Chen, C. ∙ Qi, H. ∙ Shen, Y. ... Contrasting determinants of mutation rates in germline and soma Genetics. 2017; 207 :255-267 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar 38.

Mutational strand asymmetries in cancer genomes reveal mechanisms of DNA damage and repair Cell. 2016; 164 :538-549 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Applying this approach to intronic germline SNVs, we inferred a lower mutation rate on the template strands—relative to the coding strands—of genes expressed during spermatogenesis, regardless of their expression pattern along the spermatogenesis stages ( Figure 3 C). This effect was not apparent in the unexpressed genes ( Figure S4 B), as exemplified by A-to-T (A > T) transversion mutations in Figure 3 C. Notably, we found that the coding strand, which has no transcription or only minimal levels of antisense transcription ( Pelechano and Steinmetz, 2013 74. Pelechano, V. ∙ Steinmetz, L.M. Gene regulation by antisense transcription Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14 :880-893 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ), shows similar level of SNV rates between expressed genes and unexpressed genes (except for A-to-G mutations, which are known to accumulate mutations through transcription-coupled DNA damage in the coding strand; Haradhvala et al., 2016 38. Haradhvala, N.J. ∙ Polak, P. ∙ Stojanov, P. ... Mutational strand asymmetries in cancer genomes reveal mechanisms of DNA damage and repair Cell. 2016; 164 :538-549 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We computed an “asymmetry score” to study the difference in mutation rates inferred from the coding and template strands ( Figures 3 C and 3D; Haradhvala et al., 2016 38. Haradhvala, N.J. ∙ Polak, P. ∙ Stojanov, P. ... Mutational strand asymmetries in cancer genomes reveal mechanisms of DNA damage and repair Cell. 2016; 164 :538-549 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, the expressed gene clusters showed strong asymmetry scores between the coding and template strands ( Figures 3 D and 3G). As a control, we tested the overall Watson and Crick strands ( Figures S4 D and S4E) and did not find such an asymmetry, indicating a transcription-dependent asymmetry. The difference in asymmetry scores between mutation types may reflect differential TCR efficiencies across DNA damages. For example, the A > G mutation type has the strongest asymmetry between coding and template strands, as also observed in cancer mutational signatures ( Haradhvala et al., 2016 38. Haradhvala, N.J. ∙ Polak, P. ∙ Stojanov, P. ... Mutational strand asymmetries in cancer genomes reveal mechanisms of DNA damage and repair Cell. 2016; 164 :538-549 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). The asymmetry scores decrease throughout spermatogenesis, correlating with a decreasing expression of transcription-coupled repair genes during spermatogenesis ( Figures S4 F and S4G).
We further tested whether male germ cell gene expression is unique in causing asymmetric germline mutation rates between coding and template strands. The unexpressed genes during spermatogenesis have minimal asymmetry score levels, in sharp contrast with the expressed gene clusters ( Figures 3 D and 3G). As a negative control, we shuffled the gene clustering assignments while maintaining the group sizes and found that difference of asymmetry scores disappeared ( Figures S5 A–S5C). To test whether this signal is unique to the male germ cells, we compared the asymmetry scores of unexpressed gene sets determined from the male germ cells and from somatic cell types ( Figure S5 D). We found that only the unexpressed genes from the male germ cells could predict a minimum level of coding-template asymmetry score. These results support the notion that the gene expression pattern during spermatogenesis uniquely generates the asymmetric germline mutation rates between coding and template strands.
Initiation of gene expression can occur on the opposite strand of gene upstream region and in the inverse direction, leading to bidirectional transcription ( Core et al., 2008; Duttke et al., 2015 19. Core, L.J. ∙ Waterfall, J.J. ∙ Lis, J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters Science. 2008; 322 :1845-1848 Crossref Scopus (1171) PubMed Google Scholar 25. Duttke, S.H.C. ∙ Lacadie, S.A. ∙ Ibrahim, M.M. ... Human promoters are intrinsically directional Mol. Cell. 2015; 57 :674-684 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 E). If lower mutation rates on the template strand are indeed maintained by transcription, we predicted that mutation asymmetry scores would display an inverse pattern between the opposite sides of the initiation of bidirectional transcription ( Figure 3 E). Consistently, we detected an inverse pattern of asymmetry scores between the gene body (intron) and the upstream sequences ( Figures 3 F, 3G, S4 A, and S4B). Similarly, because transcription may extend beyond the annotated end or polyadenylation site ( Figure 3 E; Proudfoot, 2016 79. Proudfoot, N.J. Transcriptional termination in mammals: stopping the RNA polymerase II juggernaut Science. 2016; 352 :aad9926 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we also predicted that the asymmetry scores in the downstream sequences would display a similar, though expectedly weaker pattern compared to that of the gene body ( Figure 3 E). Again, we found the expected pattern in which the gene body and the downstream sequences have the same pattern of asymmetry scores ( Figures 3 G, 3H, S4 B, and S4C). We further controlled the bidirectional transcription-induced mutational signature by removing the genes for which the upstream region overlaps with another gene, for example, those forming head-to-head pairs ( Trinklein et al., 2004 93. Trinklein, N.D. ∙ Aldred, S.F. ∙ Hartman, S.J. ... An abundance of bidirectional promoters in the human genome Genome Res. 2004; 14 :62-66 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ; Table S5 ; see STAR Methods ). The mutation asymmetry scores on the remaining genes still show consistent bidirectional transcription signatures ( Figure S5 E), supporting the notion that bidirectional transcription of genes causes the observed asymmetric pattern.
Finally, we also detected evidence that the same TCR influences are manifested in the mouse data ( Figures S5 F and S5G). For example, G-to-T (G > T) transversion mutations show strong conserved asymmetric mutation patterns in both the human and mouse data. Because G-to-T mutations come predominantly from endogenous oxidative DNA damage of guanine ( Menoni et al., 2018; Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017 61. Menoni, H. ∙ Wienholz, F. ∙ Theil, A.F. ... The transcription-coupled DNA repair-initiating protein CSB promotes XRCC1 recruitment to oxidative DNA damage Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :7747-7756 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar 94. Tubbs, A. ∙ Nussenzweig, A. Endogenous DNA damage as a source of genomic instability in cancer Cell. 2017; 168 :644-656 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), such conserved asymmetric germline mutation patterns between coding and template strands of genes are consistent with TCR-induced effects on germline mutations.
Point mutations are strongly biased by the local sequence context ( Helleday et al., 2014; Ségurel et al., 2014 40. Helleday, T. ∙ Eshtad, S. ∙ Nik-Zainal, S. Mechanisms underlying mutational signatures in human cancers Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15 :585-598 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar 86. Ségurel, L. ∙ Wyman, M.J. ∙ Przeworski, M. Determinants of mutation rate variation in the human germline Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2014; 15 :47-70 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, the rate of C-to-T mutations at CpG dinucleoride sites is ∼10-fold higher than the same mutation type in CpH (A/C/T) sites ( Ségurel et al., 2014 86. Ségurel, L. ∙ Wyman, M.J. ∙ Przeworski, M. Determinants of mutation rate variation in the human germline Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2014; 15 :47-70 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous studies in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer mutation profiles considering the 5′- and 3′-adjacent bases have revealed ∼30 tumor-specific mutational signatures across tumor types ( Alexandrov et al., 2013 2. Alexandrov, L.B. ∙ Nik-Zainal, S. ∙ Wedge, D.C. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative, ICGC Breast Cancer Consortium, ICGC MMML-Seq Consortium, ICGC PedBrain Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer Nature. 2013; 500 :415-421 Crossref Scopus (3646) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, we sought to understand the sequence context specificity of transcription-induced germline mutational signatures ( Figures 4 and S6 ; see STAR Methods ). Consistent with earlier results ( Nachman and Crowell, 2000 64. Nachman, M.W. ∙ Crowell, S.L. Estimate of the mutation rate per nucleotide in humans Genetics. 2000; 156 :297-304 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that C-to-T mutation rates at the CpG sites are at least 10-fold higher relative to CpH sites or any other mutation types ( Figure 4 A). Cytosine deamination damage is usually efficiently repaired through the base-excision repair (BER) pathway ( Krokan and Bjørås, 2013 53. Krokan, H.E. ∙ Bjørås, M. Base excision repair Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a012583 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). Failing to repair the deaminated cytosine in the genome causes C-to-T transition mutation upon DNA replication ( Duncan and Miller, 1980 24. Duncan, B.K. ∙ Miller, J.H. Mutagenic deamination of cytosine residues in DNA Nature. 1980; 287 :560-561 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and indeed, studying the C-to-T mutation rates according to coding and template strands, we found only a slight mutation asymmetry between the strands at the YpCpH contexts (Y stands for C or T; Figures 4 A, 4B, 4E, and 4F). C-to-T mutation at the CpG sites showed a minimal level of strand asymmetry, indicating that BER function at these sites is not generally influenced by transcription.
Systematically studying all of the mutation types, according to both their sequence contexts and coding/template strands, led us to uncover a pattern of TCR-induced germline mutational signature, which we term the “3′-pyrimidine rule.” First, consistent with our observations in Figure 3 , we found that A-to-G mutations have the strongest asymmetric mutation rates between coding and template strands ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Other mutation types, including A-to-T, G-to-T, and C-to-G mutations, also showed substantial overall levels of mutation asymmetries between the two strands ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Studying the mutation subtypes according to their adjacent bases, we found that mutation subtypes with a 3′-pyrimidine (Y) consistently have stronger asymmetry scores than the ones with a 3′-purine (S; Figure 4 B). For example, in A-to-T mutation type, we found that the asymmetry scores predominantly come from the subtypes where the reference A is in the NpApY sites. We further tested this 3′-pyrimidine rule by controlling the 5′ base, examining NXA-NXT and NXG-NXC pairs, where N is the controlled 5′ base and X is the reference base of a given mutation type (see STAR Methods ). We found that the mutation types with strong strand asymmetries (i.e., A-to-T, A-to-G, G-to-T, and C-to-G mutation types) exhibited a dramatic and significantly stronger mutation asymmetry scores when the 3′-adjacent base is a pyrimidine ( Figure 4 C). Similarly, we tested whether the germline mutational signature revealed 5′-adjacent base-associated rules. In this case, we controlled the 3′-adjacent base, generating AXN-TXN and GXN-CXN pairs. We found only a slight 5′-pyrimidine preference in the C-to-T and C-to-G mutation types ( Figure 4 D), indicating that the 5′-adjacent base has less of an impact on the germline mutational signatures than that of the 3′-adjacent base. Lastly, we repeated our analysis of the 3′-pyrimidine rule using mouse germline mutations and found that it is largely recapitulated ( Figures 4 E–4H), supporting the notion that TCR-induced mutational signatures are conserved across species.
Our results led us to propose transcriptional scanning as a mechanism to systematically reduce DNA-damage-induced mutagenesis in the bulk of genes by widespread spermatogenic transcription to safeguard the germline genome sequence integrity ( Figure 5 A). We predicted that transcriptional scanning would be tuned by different expression levels in the testis. Indeed, examining our total and strand-specific germline SNV rates in the intron regions according to different expression levels ( Figure 5 B; Table S6 ; see STAR Methods ), we observed that, as expression level increases, the overall mutation rate drops ( Figure 5 C), and furthermore, that this drop can be mostly attributed to the template strand, supporting a transcription-dependent manner of DNA repair ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Surprisingly, however, the very highly expressed genes showed the opposite effect: the overall mutation rates and template strand mutation rates all increase, and the mutation rates on the coding strand also substantially increase ( Figure 5 D). We propose that this pattern indicates that the very highly expressed genes incur transcription-coupled DNA damage ( Figure 2 A), especially on the coding strand ( Figure 5 D). This observation is consistent with previous reports from other systems of transcription-associated mutagenesis in highly expressed genes ( Jinks-Robertson and Bhagwat, 2014; Park et al., 2012 44. Jinks-Robertson, S. ∙ Bhagwat, A.S. Transcription-associated mutagenesis Annu. Rev. Genet. 2014; 48 :341-359 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Park, C. ∙ Qian, W. ∙ Zhang, J. Genomic evidence for elevated mutation rates in highly expressed genes EMBO Rep. 2012; 13 :1123-1129 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). The A-to-G transition mutation type has the most evident TCD-induced mutation rate increase ( Figure 5 D), and similarly, a strong TCD-induced effect was readily observed in somatic A-to-G mutations in liver cancer samples ( Haradhvala et al., 2016 38. Haradhvala, N.J. ∙ Polak, P. ∙ Stojanov, P. ... Mutational strand asymmetries in cancer genomes reveal mechanisms of DNA damage and repair Cell. 2016; 164 :538-549 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, the TCD-induced effect in the very highly expressed spermatogenesis genes is consistent across all mutation types, supporting a general TCD effect ( Figures 5 D and 5E).
Overall, this analysis suggests that spermatogenesis gene expression level tunes germline mutation rates by transcriptional scanning. Increasing gene expression levels during spermatogenesis are correlated with mutation rate reduction on the template strand ( Figure 5 D) but only to a point, while on the coding strand, increasing gene expression levels lead to increased mutation rates ( Figure 5 D). In the very highly expressed genes, TCD overwhelms the TCR-induced reductions and produces an overall higher germline mutation rate than genes expressed at moderate levels ( Figure 5 C).
Although our analysis into the germline mutational signatures thus far was based on population-wide SNVs, we sought to further test our model using de novo germline mutations (DNMs), because these constitute a set of variants that have only recently entered the human population and consequently are less influenced by natural selection ( Acuna-Hidalgo et al., 2016 1. Acuna-Hidalgo, R. ∙ Veltman, J.A. ∙ Hoischen, A. New insights into the generation and role of de novo mutations in health and disease Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :241 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). We collected two publicly available DNM datasets from large-scale healthy trio-WGS studies ( An et al., 2018; Jónsson et al., 2017 3. An, J.Y. ∙ Lin, K. ∙ Zhu, L. ... Genome-wide de novo risk score implicates promoter variation in autism spectrum disorder Science. 2018; 362 :eaat6576 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar 46. Jónsson, H. ∙ Sulem, P. ∙ Kehr, B. ... Parental influence on human germline de novo mutations in 1,548 trios from Iceland Nature. 2017; 549 :519-522 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), generating a total of 214,728 single-nucleotide DNMs for testing our transcriptional scanning model. Analyzing DNM rates across our gene clusters defined from spermatogenesis expression pattern ( Figures 1 D and 1E) or expression level ( Figure 5 B), we again found that spermatogenesis-expressed genes exhibit a lower level of mutation rates, tuned by their expression level ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Additionally, we considered the local sequence contexts of these DNMs and calculated their mutation rates on both coding strand and template strand ( Figure 6 C). We found that the mutation rates calculated from population-wide SNVs and that from the DNMs are highly correlated in both coding and template strands ( Figures 6 E and 6F), supporting our earlier analysis into the germline mutational signatures using SNVs. Finally, we compared the asymmetry scores computed from population-wide SNVs and that from DNMs, and again, we observed consistent results ( Figure 6 G). Collectively, the de novo mutation datasets clearly recapitulate our observation of transcription-dependent mutational signatures and the effect of transcriptional scanning derived from analyzing the population-wide SNVs.
To study the evolutionary aspects of transcriptional scanning, we first studied the functional attributes of the unexpressed genes during spermatogenesis, which are the relative minority of genes that in our model would not benefit from transcriptional scanning. In this set of 1,890 genes, we observed significant enrichment for fast-evolving genes between human and apes (dN/dS values larger than 1.0; hypergeometric p value: 1.0e−15; see STAR Methods ). These genes are enriched for functions related to environmental sensing, immune system, defense responses, and signal transduction ( Figures 7 A and S7 A; Table S7 ). These functions are known to have evolved faster in the human genome ( Boehm, 2012; Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010; Singh et al., 2012 9. Boehm, T. Evolution of vertebrate immunity Curr. Biol. 2012; 22 :R722-R732 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Flajnik, M.F. ∙ Kasahara, M. Origin and evolution of the adaptive immune system: genetic events and selective pressures Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11 :47-59 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar 89. Singh, R.S. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Kulathinal, R.J. Rapidly Evolving Genes and Genetic Systems Oxford University Press, 2012 Crossref Google Scholar ), and their lack of expression in the testes provides a possible contribution to their unique mode of evolution. Consistently, we detected the highest rates of sequence divergence across ape genomes among our category of unexpressed genes (hypergeometric p value of enrichment in the top 10% highly divergent genes: 8.8e−10; see STAR Methods ; Figure 7 B). Although selection is typically invoked to account for the rapid evolution of genes ( Figures S7 B and S7C), biased germline mutation rates may also contribute, according to the neutral theory of gene evolution ( Boehm, 2012; Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010; Nei et al., 2010 9. Boehm, T. Evolution of vertebrate immunity Curr. Biol. 2012; 22 :R722-R732 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Flajnik, M.F. ∙ Kasahara, M. Origin and evolution of the adaptive immune system: genetic events and selective pressures Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11 :47-59 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Nei, M. ∙ Suzuki, Y. ∙ Nozawa, M. The neutral theory of molecular evolution in the genomic era Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2010; 11 :265-289 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test this, we studied the synonymous substitution rates (dS, generally assumed to be neutral) as a proxy for the germline mutation rates and used this measure to compare between the spermatogenesis-expressed and unexpressed genes. Interestingly, we found that the spermatogenesis-expressed genes have lower dS values ( Figure 7 C), consistent with our analysis of SNV rates in the intron regions ( Figures S3 J and S3K). We further found that the very highly expressed genes in spermatogenesis have increased rates of divergence ( Figures S7 F–S7I). As expected from their high expression, we found that this set of genes is mainly enriched for roles in male reproduction ( Figure S7 J; Table S7 ). Together, our analyses into human-ape gene divergence provide evidence that widespread gene expression during spermatogenesis may have shaped gene evolution rates.

Section: Discussion

Our findings led us to propose the transcriptional scanning model ( Figure 7 D), whereby widespread transcription during spermatogenesis systematically reduces germline mutations in the expressed genes by TCR, thereby safeguarding the germ cell genome sequence integrity. Given that this process is carried out in the germline, the variable mutation rates have important implications. Combined with natural selection, this process may contribute to the relatively slower evolution of the bulk of spermatogenesis-expressed genes ( Figure 7 D, middle). The small group of unexpressed genes during spermatogenesis is enriched for sensory and immune/defense system genes ( Figure 7 A), and our transcriptional scanning model provides insight into how variation is preferentially retained in this class of genes. The biased germline mutation rates provide increased population-wide genetic diversity, which may be under strong selective biases for adaptation at the population level in rapidly changing environments. Genes with very high germline expression form a third class, and these exhibit higher germline mutation rates, which our model explains in terms of TCD obscuring the effect of TCR ( Figures 5 F and 7 D, right). The model thus provides a comprehensive view of the combined effects of TCR and TCD in spermatogenic cells ( Figure 5 F) and refines previous observations that germline mutation rates increase with expression levels although highly expressed genes evolve more slowly ( Chen et al., 2017; Drummond et al., 2005; Good and Nachman, 2005; Pál et al., 2001; Park et al., 2012 17.

Genomic evidence for elevated mutation rates in highly expressed genes EMBO Rep. 2012; 13 :1123-1129 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the observed mutational bias does not alone direct evolution according to our model—because genetic diversity in the population is also influenced by genetic drift and natural selection—we propose that it contributes to global gene evolution rates.
Gene evolution at the sequence level involves (1) the generation of novel DNA variants, stemming from DNA-damage-induced mutagenesis, replication errors, and/or recombination, and (2) natural selection and/or drift on the novel variants ( Nei, 2005; Nei et al., 2010 67. Nei, M. Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22 :2318-2342 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Nei, M. ∙ Suzuki, Y. ∙ Nozawa, M. The neutral theory of molecular evolution in the genomic era Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2010; 11 :265-289 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results suggest that a DNA-repair mechanism contributes to the biased production of germline variants throughout the genome, and we propose that this represents a hitherto under-appreciated aspect in the establishment of differential gene evolution rates. Thus, DNA repair pathways act to constrain mutagenic DNA damage in a biased manner, analogous to the effects of selection and drift in the population ( Figure 7 E). By understanding these patterns of uneven germline mutations and the intrinsic removal mechanism of germline DNA damage, our model provides insight into mutation-driven genome evolution ( Nei, 2013 68. Nei, M. Mutation-Driven Evolution Oxford University Press, 2013 Google Scholar ), such that transcriptional scanning in spermatogenesis imposes an additional bias in modulating rates of gene evolution.
Beyond modulating germline mutation rates and evolution rates, widespread gene expression during spermatogenesis generates a unique pattern of transcription-dependent germline mutational signatures ( Figures 3 , 4 , and 5 ). Our analysis into context-specific germline mutation rates allowed us to identify a new mutational signature induced by TCR, which we term 3′-pyrimidine rule, suggesting that TCR functions more efficiently at the XpY sites, where X and Y stand for the damaged base and pyrimidine, respectively. The results are also consistent with a model whereby TCR-recognizable DNA damages occur more frequently at the XpY sites but with no frequency bias between the coding and template strand. RNA polymerase would then recruit TCR machinery to the template strand for DNA damage repair, generating coding-template asymmetric mutation rates. Future work is required to understand which mechanism (or both) leads to the 3′-pyrimidine rule of the transcription-dependent germline mutational signatures.
Although transcriptional scanning is proposed to systematically detect and remove bulky germline DNA damages, male germ cells are still expected to retain damage that cannot be repaired by the TCR machinery, resulting in germline mutations ( Barnes and Lindahl, 2004; Vermeulen and Fousteri, 2013 5. Barnes, D.E. ∙ Lindahl, T. Repair and genetic consequences of endogenous DNA base damage in mammalian cells Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38 :445-476 Crossref Scopus (553) PubMed Google Scholar 96. Vermeulen, W. ∙ Fousteri, M. Mammalian transcription-coupled excision repair Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a012625 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). These male germline mutations likely originate from DNA replication errors, accumulating with paternal age ( Kong et al., 2012 52. Kong, A. ∙ Frigge, M.L. ∙ Masson, G. ... Rate of de novo mutations and the importance of father’s age to disease risk Nature. 2012; 488 :471-475 Crossref Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ), or less bulky DNA damages like base deamination ( Krokan and Bjørås, 2013 53. Krokan, H.E. ∙ Bjørås, M. Base excision repair Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a012583 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recombination-induced double-strand breaks in the germ cell genome are also frequent, affecting mutation rates near crossover hotspots ( Arbeithuber et al., 2015 4. Arbeithuber, B. ∙ Betancourt, A.J. ∙ Ebner, T. ... Crossovers are associated with mutation and biased gene conversion at recombination hotspots Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :2109-2114 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, beyond TCR, it will be of interest to analyze the germline mutation pattern with respect to other DNA repair pathways, such as mismatch repair following germ-cell-specific genome replication ( Yehuda et al., 2018 105. Yehuda, Y. ∙ Blumenfeld, B. ∙ Mayorek, N. ... Germline DNA replication timing shapes mammalian genome composition Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :8299-8310 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), and distinct chromatin states, which may affect transcription-independent DNA repair ( Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2019; Krokan and Bjørås, 2013; Supek and Lehner, 2017 31.

Clustered mutation signatures reveal that error-prone DNA repair targets mutations to active genes Cell. 2017; 170 :534-547.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our model leads to important testable predictions and may provide deeper insights into human genetics and diseases. First, the same process should also hold in other species that have similar widespread transcription in male germ cells ( Soumillon et al., 2013 91. Soumillon, M. ∙ Necsulea, A. ∙ Weier, M. ... Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis Cell Rep. 2013; 3 :2179-2190 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we also provide evidence for conserved transcriptional scanning in mouse ( Figures 4 , S2 , S4 , and S6 ). Interestingly, a recent study on Drosophila testis gene expression using scRNA-seq also revealed widespread transcription and that the mutation rate of germ cells decreases with the progression of spermatogenesis ( Witt et al., 2019 102. Witt, E. ∙ Benjamin, S. ∙ Svetec, N. ...

This observation is consistent with our model that transcription-coupled DNA repair during spermatogenesis removes existing germline DNA damages. Second, we expect that TCR-deficient animals should produce offspring with an increase in the number of de novo mutations in the germline-expressed genes and that they would not show the characteristic lower mutation rates in the template—versus the coding—strand. For patients with TCR gene-associated mutations, such as Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum ( Cleaver, 2017 18. Cleaver, J.E. Transcription coupled repair deficiency protects against human mutagenesis and carcinogenesis: personal reflections on the 50th anniversary of the discovery of xeroderma pigmentosum DNA Repair (Amst.). 2017; 58 :21-28 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), our model predicts overall higher germline mutation rates. Lastly, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) share similar patterns of widespread transcription ( Efroni et al., 2008 27. Efroni, S. ∙ Duttagupta, R. ∙ Cheng, J. ... Global transcription in pluripotent embryonic stem cells Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2 :437-447 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (418) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading us to speculate that systematic scanning and removal of DNA damage also functions in ESCs. If so, beyond spermatogenesis, transcriptional scanning may be deployed to achieve lower mutation rates in ESCs and in the early developing embryos ( Cervantes et al., 2002; Efroni et al., 2008 14.

Human testicular tissue was obtained from New York University Langone Health (NYULH) Fertility Center; this was approved by the NYULH Institutional Review Board (IRB). Fresh seminiferous tubules were collected from testicular sperm extraction (TESE) surgery of two healthy donors (one was 40-year old and the other was 45-year old) with an obstructive etiology for infertility. The tissues were collected and processed in different time (with a time interval of one year). There was no drug or hormonal treatments prior to the TESE surgery in both cases. The donors were fully informed before signing consent to donating excess tissue for research use. This was again done in fashion consistent with the IRB (including tissue sample de-identification).
C57BL/6J mice (4-month old) were bought from the Jackson Laboratory through the New York University Langone Health (NYULH) Rodent Genetic Engineering Laboratory. Mice were anesthetized before sacrificing for testicular tissue collection following the NYULH IRB requirements for experimental animal operation.
Human testicular tissues were kept in cell culture grade PBS buffer and transported to the research lab on ice within 1h post TESE surgery for single-cell preparation. Testicular single-cell suspension was prepared by adapting existing protocols ( Valli et al., 2014 95. Valli, H. ∙ Sukhwani, M. ∙ Dovey, S.L. ... Fluorescence- and magnetic-activated cell sorting strategies to isolate and enrich human spermatogonial stem cells Fertil. Steril. 2014; 102 :566-580.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, samples from TESE surgery was washed once with PBS and resuspended in 5mL PBS. Seminiferous tubules were minced quickly in a cell culture dish and spun down at 100 g for 0.5min to remove supernatants. The minced tissue was resuspended in 8mL of 37°C pre-warmed tissue dissociation enzyme mix (See below). Tissue dissociation was done by incubating at 37°C for 20min with mechanical dissociation using serological pipette every 5min. After digestion, the reaction was quenched by adding 2mL of 100% FBS (GIBCO, Cat. 16000044) to a final concentration of 20%. Dissociation mix was filtered through a 100um strainer to remove remaining seminiferous tubule chunks. Cells were washed once with DMEM medium (GIBCO, Cat. 11965092) with 10% of FBS and twice with PBS to remove residual EDTA in the cell suspension. Cell viability was checked with Trypan-blue staining (with over 85% viable cells) before moving to the inDrop microfluidics platform. The tissue dissociation enzyme mix (8mL) was composed of 7.56mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO, Cat. 25200056), 400μL of 20mg/mL type IV Collagenase (GIBCO, Cat. 17104019) and 40μL of 2U/μL TURBO DNase (Invitrogen, Cat. AM2238).
C57BL/6J mice (4-month old) were bought from the Jackson Laboratory through the New York University Langone Health (NYULH) Rodent Genetic Engineering Laboratory. Mice were anesthetized before sacrificing for testicular tissue collection following the NYULH IRB requirements for experimental animal operation. Together, two mice were collected and processed separately as biological replicates, with a time interval of two months. The dissociated testicular tissue was kept in the PBS buffer and then transported to the research lab on ice immediately for single-cell dissociation. The tissue dissociation protocol is slightly different from the human testicular tissue dissociation. The whole testis was decapsulated in PBS buffer to collect the seminiferous tubules. The seminiferous tubules were quickly minced into small pieces of ∼2-5mm and then washed once with PBS buffer. The minced tissue was resuspended in 8mL of 37°C pre-warmed tissue dissociation buffer 1 (1mg/mL type IV Collagenase in DMEM medium) and incubate at 37°C for 5min. This pre-dissociation step removes majority of the interstitial cells. The tissue was then spun down at 100 g for 1min to remove supernatants. The tissue was resuspended by 8mL tissue dissociation buffer 2 (7.96mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and 40μL of 2U/μL TURBO DNase). The second tissue dissociation was done by incubating at 37°C for 15min with mechanical dissociation using serological pipette every 5min. The dissociation was quenched by adding 2mL of 100% FBS to a final concentration of 20%. Dissociation mix was filtered through a 100um strainer to remove any remaining tissue chunks. Cells were washed once with DMEM medium and twice with PBS to remove residual EDTA. Cell viability was checked with Trypan-blue staining (both replicates had over 95% viable cells) before moving to the inDrop microfluidics platform.
Single-cell barcoding was carried out with the inDrop Single Cell RNA Seq Kit (1CellBio, Cat. 10196) on the inDrop microfluidics system (1CellBio, Cat. 10256-01) as instructed by the manufacturer and by its original developers ( Klein et al., 2015 50. Klein, A.M. ∙ Mazutis, L. ∙ Akartuna, I. ... Droplet barcoding for single-cell transcriptomics applied to embryonic stem cells Cell. 2015; 161 :1187-1201 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (922) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the microfluidic chip and barcoded hydrogel beads were primed ahead of single cell preparation. The ready-to-use single-cell suspension in PBS (after two times wash with PBS buffer) was adjusted to 0.1 million/mL by counting with hemocytometer. Next, the prepared cells, reverse transcription reagents (SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen, Cat. 18080085), barcoded hydrogel beads and droplet-making oil were loaded onto the microfluidic chip sequentially. Encapsulation was done by adjusting microfluidic flow rates as instructed. Single-cell barcoding and reverse transcription in the droplets were done by incubating at 50°C for 2h followed by heat inactivation at 70°C for 15min. Then the droplets containing barcoded single-cells were aliquoted aiming for 1000-2000 cells per aliquot and then decapsulated by adding 5-10μL demulsifying agent included in the inDrop Single Cell RNA Seq Kit.
Single-cell RNA-Seq library preparation after inDrop single-cell capturing was carried out as instructed by the manufacturer (1CellBio) and similar to the CEL-Seq2 method ( Hashimshony et al., 2016 39. Hashimshony, T. ∙ Senderovich, N. ∙ Avital, G. ... CEL-Seq2: sensitive highly-multiplexed single-cell RNA-Seq Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :77 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Basically, barcoded single-cell cDNA was purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat. A63987) followed by second-strand synthesis reaction with NEBNext mRNA Second Strand Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Cat. E6111S). Then linear amplification of cDNA was carried out through in vitro transcription (IVT) using HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Cat. E2040S). IVT-amplified RNA was fragmented and purified again with Agencourt RNAClean XP magnetic beads. The second reverse transcription was done with PrimeScriptTM Reverse Transcriptase (Takara Clonetech, Cat. 2680A) followed with cDNA purification with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat. A63881). Quantity of cDNA was determined by qPCR on a fraction (5%) of purified cDNA. Final PCR amplification was done according to qPCR results and purified with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads. Library concentration was determined by Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Cat. Q32851). Library size was determined by Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis Kit (Agilent, Cat. 5067-4626).
Single-cell RNA-Seq library sequencing was carried out with Illumina NextSeq 500/550 75 cycles High Output v2 kit (Cat. FC-404-2005). Custom sequencing primers were used for NextSeq sequencing as instructed and provided by the manufacturer (1CellBio, Cat. 10196) ( Klein et al., 2015 50. Klein, A.M. ∙ Mazutis, L. ∙ Akartuna, I. ... Droplet barcoding for single-cell transcriptomics applied to embryonic stem cells Cell. 2015; 161 :1187-1201 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (922) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, 5% of PhiX Control v3 (Illumina, Cat. FC-110-3001) library was added to give more complexity to scRNA-Seq libraries. Pair-end sequencing was carried out with read1 (barcodes) for 34bp, index read for 6bp and read2 (transcripts) for 50bp. We processed and sequenced two technical replicates for each human testicular sample and one technical replicate for each mouse testicular sample, together generating 6 scRNA-seq datasets for downstream analysis.
Raw sequencing data obtained from the inDrop method were processed using a custom-built pipeline, available at https://github.com/flo-compbio/singlecell . Briefly, the “W1” adaptor sequence of the inDrop RT primer was located in the barcode read (the second read of each fragment), by comparing the 22-mer sequences starting at positions 9-12 of the read with the known W1 sequence (“GAGTGATTGCTTGTGACGCCTT”), allowing at most two mismatches. Reads for which the W1 sequence could not be located in this way were discarded. The start position of the W1 sequence was then used to infer the length of the first part of the inDrop cell barcode in each read, which can range from 8-11 bp, as well as the start position of the second part of the inDrop cell barcode, which always consists of 8 bp. Cell barcode sequences were mapped to the known list of 384 barcode sequences for each read, allowing at most one mismatch. The resulting barcode combination was used to identify the cell from which the fragment originated. Finally, the UMI sequence was extracted, and reads with low-confidence base calls for the six bases comprising the UMI sequence (minimal PHRED score less than 20) were discarded. The reads containing the mRNA sequence (the read 2 of each fragment) were mapped to the references genomes (here human GRCh38 and mouse GRCm38) by STAR 2.5.3a with parameter ‘—outSAMmultNmax 1’ and default settings otherwise ( Dobin et al., 2013 22. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (6845) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mapped reads were split according to their cell barcode and assigned to genes by testing for overlap with exons of protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNA genes, based on genome annotations from Ensembl release 90. For each gene, the number of unique UMIs across all reads assigned to that gene was determined (UMI filtering), corresponding to the number of transcripts expressed and captured.
Single cells with less than 1,000 expressed genes or contain more than 20% of transcripts from either mitochondrial genes (i.e., genes that are part of the mitochondrial genome) or ribosomal protein genes were removed from downstream analysis. After filtering, the single cells from different biological or technical replicate were merged together for downstream analysis. In total, we have 2554 cell from human, with an average of 6499 UMI counts and 2495 expressed protein-coding genes in the raw data. From mouse testes, we obtained 1593 cells after quality filtering, with an average of 8998 UMI counts and 2601 expressed protein-coding genes in the raw data. The more detailed cell information from each sample is provided in the Table S1 .
Following cell quality filtering, clustering was done by k-means on the principal component analysis scores, with k determined by ‘elbow-method’ ( Kodinariya and Makwana, 2013 51. Kodinariya, T.M. ∙ Makwana, P.R. Review on determining number of cluster in K-means clustering Int. J. Adv. Res. Comput. Sci. Manag. Stud. 2013; 1 :90-95 Google Scholar ). To increase the performance of cell clustering step, the raw UMI counts of testicular single cells were pre-processed through the kNN-smoothing method, with k = 3 which indicates a smoothing step involving the nearest 3 single cell transcriptomes. The smoothing step greatly reduces the noise in scRNA-seq data while retaining the variance between single cells ( Wagner et al., 2017 98. Wagner, F. ∙ Yan, Y. ∙ Yanai, I. K-nearest neighbor smoothing for high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq data bioRxiv. 2017; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Following kNN-smoothing, the principal component analysis used for cell clustering was performed on the smoothed UMI expression matrix of all testicular cells. The pre-processed expression matrices were first normalized to 100,000 transcripts per cell, followed by calculating the Fano factor (or variance-to-mean ratio, VMR) for each gene ( Baron et al., 2016 6. Baron, M. ∙ Veres, A. ∙ Wolock, S.L. ... A single-cell transcriptomic map of the human and mouse pancreas reveals inter- and intra-cell population structure Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :346-360.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes with a Fano factor larger than 1.5 folds of the mean values were defined as dynamically expressed genes. In total, 3615 dynamically expressed genes were selected from the human datasets for downstream PCA visualization and cell clustering. PCA was then performed on the normalized and log 2 transformed expression matrix using the dynamically expressed genes. Cell clustering was done by k-means clustering with elbow-methods determined k. Following first rounds of cell clustering (k = 24), several marker genes were used to determine spermatogenic cell types/states versus somatic cells. DDX4 (also called VASA ) was used as a pan-germ cell marker to distinguish the spermatogenic cell lineage from the somatic cells.

Together, we identified 14 human spermatogenic cell clusters with at least 50 cells in each cluster (min value as 69 cells, corresponding to spermatocyte-1). Seven cell clusters which overlapped with each other were identified as somatic cells (as shown in Figure 1 B). These cells were isolated for an additional k-means clustering algorithm (k = 5) and visualized through the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) algorithm, as shown in Figures 1 B and S1 D.

Sertoli cells modulate testicular vascular network development, structure, and function to influence circulating testosterone concentrations in adult male mice Endocrinology. 2016; 157 :2479-2488 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three small clusters with mixed expression profiles and/or bad quality were labeled as “other” and discarded as potential contaminants and/or doublets. Mouse testicular cells were analyzed in the same process. In brief, 1915 dynamically expressed genes were selected from the mouse datasets for PCA and cell clustering. Cell clustering with k-means algorithm generated 16 clusters (optimum k defined by elbow-method), out of which 13 clusters were kept as mouse spermatogenic cell clusters, and 3 clusters with few cells were discarded for downstream analysis.
We used the R package Monocle2 (version 2.6.1) ( Qiu et al., 2017 80. Qiu, X. ∙ Mao, Q. ∙ Tang, Y. ... Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :979-982 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ) to infer pseudotime tracks for both human and mouse testicular germ cells. The raw UMI counts of the isolated spermatogenic cells were pre-processed through the kNN-smoothing method (k = 3) before performing pseudotime inference. We found that smoothing process greatly increased the resolution of pseudotime tracks as compared to the ones directly inferred from the raw UMI counts (data not shown). Pseudotime inference was performed with default parameters according to the user manual ( http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/docs/ ): 1) Set “negbinomial.size()” for expression distribution, and estimated size factors and dispersions. 2) Select genes detected among at least 5% of input cells to project cells to 2D space using “DDRTree” method. 3) Order cells and visualize pseudotime tracks as shown in Figures S1 F and S2 F. The ascending order of pseudotime values was consistent to the pattern of marker genes during spermatogenesis for both human and mouse (data not shown).
We used the R package ‘velocyto.R’ (version 0.6) to estimate RNA velocity according to the standard procedures suggested by the developers ( La Manno et al., 2018 55. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RNA velocity estimation involves three separate UMI count matrices: intronic UMIs (nmat), exonic UMIs (emat), and the optional intron-exon spanning matrix (spmat). These matrices were generated by the ‘dropEst’ pipeline (version 0.7.1, https://github.com/hms-dbmi/dropEst ) ( Petukhov et al., 2018 76. Petukhov, V. ∙ Guo, J. ∙ Baryawno, N. ... dropEst: pipeline for accurate estimation of molecular counts in droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq experiments Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :78 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 1) raw sequencing reads were tagged by ‘droptag’ with the default ‘inDrop v1&v2′ configuration file except here that the ‘r1_rc_length’ was set as 3. 2) The tagged reads were mapped to the reference genomes (here human GRCh38 and mouse GRCm38) using STAR (version 2.5.3a) with default settings. 3) The alignments were processed by ‘dropEst’ with gene annotation GTF file (Ensembl release 90) and the default settings except here the ‘–merge-barcodes’ option was additionally called as suggested in the standard procedure. We followed the velocyto.R manual ( https://github.com/velocyto-team/velocyto.R ) which used emat and nmat to estimate and visualize RNA velocity. With predefined cell stage, we performed gene filtering with the parameter “min.max.cluster.average” set to 0.1 and 0.03 for emat and nmat, respectively. RNA velocity was estimated with the default settings except the parameters ‘kCells’ and ‘fit.quantile’ which were set as 3 and 0.05, respectively. RNA velocity field was visualized on a separate PCA embedding as shown in Figure 1 C for human testicular germ cells, and in Figure S2 A for mouse testicular germ cells, respectively.
Following identifying the human and mouse spermatogenic cells separately, human-mouse spermatogenesis comparison was performed on genes which have one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse. Human-mouse one-to-one orthologous gene pair list was downloaded from Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)-Vertebrate Homology ( http://www.informatics.jax.org/homology.shtml ). After filtering, 17,012 one-to-one orthologous genes were selected for integrating the human and mouse spermatogenic cells. Joint PCA was performed by selecting dynamically expressed genes using integrated gene expression matrix. In total, 1,124 genes were selected to perform joint PCA, as the results shown in Figures S2 G and S2H. Top 20 genes contributing to PC2 from both ends, separating human and mouse species-specific signature, were selected and plotted in Figure S2 I.
Gene clustering was performed on a collapsed expression matrix of genes-by-spermatogenic clusters across all testicular germ cells. First, we defined the set of unexpressed genes by having expression (minimum of 1 UMI count per cell) in at least 5 single cells from the kNN-smoothing method (k = 3) smoothed scRNA-seq data. The genes pass such criteria were defined as expressed genes, leading to the estimation of expressing ∼90.5% of human genes ( Figures 1 D and 1E) and ∼80.4% of mouse genes ( Figures S2 C and S2D). We also tested the sensitivity to different parameters for determining expression or unexpression status. Specifically, we included the criterion of minimal expression level (> 0.1 mean UMI count in at least one cell cluster) or changing the criterion of minimal expressed cell number to 10 cells. Following determining expression or unexpression of genes, the expressed genes were then clustered by k-means algorithm, with k varied from 2 to 10, as shown in Figure S3 D. A combination of parameters for determining expression/unexpression and k-expressed gene clusters allowed us to test the sensitivity of the observed reduction of germline mutation rates in the expressed genes relative to the unexpressed genes. Through interpreting the results, minimal expression in 5 single cells was chosen as the optimal criterion for determining expression or unexpression; k = 5 was chosen to display the expressed gene clusters as it best represents the overall gene expression dynamics during spermatogenesis. The determined gene clusters were used for downstream analysis into the mutation signatures. The gene names of each cluster were provided in the Table S3 . We applied the same criteria to human germ cells from individual donor or independent dataset for sensitivity analysis as shown in Figures S3 B and S3C. We also applied the same criteria to the mouse germ cells for determine gene clusters as shown in Figures S2 C and S2D, and the corresponding gene lists were provided in the Table S4 .
The human expressed genes were additionally clustered by their expression level, as used in the Figure 4 B. The average expression level (UMI counts) across the spermatogenic cell clusters were used as input. To assign gene groups based on expression levels, we binned the genes by expression level into 9 groups: Group 1: unexpressed; Group 2: −inf < log 2 (UMI mean ) ≤ −8; Group 3: −8 < log 2 (UMI mean ) ≤ −6; Group 4: −6 < log 2 (UMI mean ) ≤ −4; Group 5: −4 < log 2 (UMI mean ) ≤ −2; Group 6: −2 < log 2 (UMI mean ) ≤ 0; Group 7: 0 < log 2 (UMI mean ) ≤ 2; Group 8: 2 < log 2 (UMI mean ) ≤ 4; Group 9: 4 < log 2 (UMI mean ), highly expressed.
The gene names of each expression-level gene group were provided in the Table S6 .
In addition, for modeling the germline variant levels versus expression level, the expression level was further binned into smaller groups. Specifically, log 2 (UMI mean ) expression level between −8 and 4 were evenly binned into 100 expression level stages, and the genes within each expression level stage were isolated for calculating the germline variants levels and confidence intervals.
As a control analysis in Figure S5 E, the genes which have their upstream 5kb region overlapped with an inverse-oriented gene, together termed as upstream-confounded genes, were determined and removed from analyzing the mutation asymmetry scores. These upstream-confounded genes include those genes naturally formed into head-to-head pairs. We extracted the gene feature table from Ensembl 91 (being consistent with the germline variants database), containing chromosome, gene start position, gene end position and strand information for each gene. We sorted the genes by chromosome and then by the gene start sites considering the gene orientation. We then determined the natural bidirectional genes as head-to-head gene pairs with the gap between two gene start sites smaller than 5kb. In addition, we determined the genes which have their upstream 5kb region overlapped with an inverse-oriented gene as confounded genes. Together, we identified 2270 genes forming bidirectional gene pairs, which is ∼11.4% of all protein-coding genes, consistent with previous study on bidirectional gene pairs ( Trinklein et al., 2004 93. Trinklein, N.D. ∙ Aldred, S.F. ∙ Hartman, S.J. ... An abundance of bidirectional promoters in the human genome Genome Res. 2004; 14 :62-66 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together with other genes which have their upstream region overlapped, we identified 4094 upstream-confounded genes. The gene lists of bidirectional gene pairs and all upstream-confounded genes were provided in Table S5 .
External scRNA-seq datasets were all downloaded from the public deposit according to the specific instruction from the original publication. Human adult testicular cell scRNA-seq dataset was downloaded from GEO: GSE112013 , and the cell type annotation was extracted from the SI Table 1 of the original publication ( Guo et al., 2018 35.

To count the expressed protein-coding gene numbers of a corresponding cell cluster or scRNA-seq sample type, we used a bootstrap sampling strategy to overcome the technical variance of gene number estimates in different studies. We first binarized the gene expression in a single cell as expressed or unexpressed, defined as > 0 or = 0 UMI/TPM count. Gene expression in a cell cluster/sample was defined as having expression in at least 5 cells from a random sampling (with replacement) of 1000 cells. According to this definition, the presented numbers in Table S2 represent the average detected protein-coding gene number of bootstrap sampling (with replacement) of 1000 cells for 100 times. Such a strategy overcomes the variance of cell numbers, as well as minimizing the effects of differential sequencing depth between studies, thus allowing an overall fair comparison of protein-coding gene numbers across different cell/sample types and across studies.
Human and mouse germline variants were downloaded from the Ensembl release 91 FTP site ( ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/variation/vcf/homo_sapiens/homo_sapiens.vcf.gz and ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/variation/vcf/mus_musculus/mus_musculus.vcf.gz , respectively). VCF file containing the 1000Genome phase 3 germline variants was downloaded from the Ensembl release 91 FTP site ( ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/variation/vcf/homo_sapiens/1000GENOMES-phase_3.vcf.gz ).
We pre-processed the human germline variants in the VCF file ( homo_sapiens.vcf. ) with custom bash and Perl scripts. As a first step, we restricted the germline mutation records to only the source database of dbSNP (dbSNP150) and then restricted the mutation type as single nucleotide variants (TSV = SNV). Second, we removed any SNV records with a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 5% so that only to use the SNV records with MAF < 0.05 for downstream analysis. This step allows minimizing the effect of positive selection on germline mutational signature analysis. Third, we checked the SNV record information by referring its genome reference allele (ref) to its ancestral allele (AA). Around 97.7% (303,936,260/311,056,106) of the SNV records are annotated with an ancestral allele. If the annotated reference allele of an SNV record is inconsistent with its AA, we then assigned the ancestral allele as the reference allele of this SNV record while the other allele was assigned as the alternative allele. For example, if an SNV record is annotated as C (ref) to T (alt) but comes with an AA = T, we will then assign this SNV record as a T-to-C mutation instead of a C-to-T mutation. Such a replacement of the reference allele to its ancestral allele affects ∼1.5% (4,710,352/311,056,106) of the total SNV records. Fourth, occasionally, an SNV was recorded incorrectly, with swapped reference and alternative bases. These SNVs mostly locate in the pan-telomere region and/or in sex chromosomes. We corrected such SNV records by swapping back the reference and alternative bases according to the human reference genome (hg38). Such incorrect recording affects ∼0.067% (210,695/311,056,106) of the total SNV records. Lastly, we extracted the 5′- and 3′-adjacent bases of the reference of each SNV record, in order to generate the triple-base reference allele for each SNV record. Following these five steps, the final output of each SNV record was recorded to include key information of chromosome, location, reference, triple-base reference and mutant base. Exampled below:
CHR LOCATION REF_BASE TRIPLE_BASE_REF MUT_BASE

The output of 311,056,106 clean SNV records from homo_sapiens.vcf. were used for counting SNVs according to gene loci, and the results were used as input for all downstream human germline variants analysis unless specifically stated.
Germline variants from 1000GENOMES-phase_3.vcf. were processed in exactly the same way. In total, 1,916,266 out of 77,202,542 SNV records (∼2.48%) were corrected according to the ancestral allele and 8 SNV records were corrected according to the hg38 reference genome. The output file containing 77,202,542 SNV records from 1000GENOMES-phase_3.vcf. was used as the input data for control analysis as shown in Figure S3 E.
In parallel, we applied the same pipelines for the mouse germline SNVs ( mus_musculus.vcf. ). The correction step affected 51 out of the 73,077,311 mouse SNV records. The processed mouse germline SNV records were used for computing germline SNV rates in the downstream analysis.
We used a custom bash script and an R script to count the processed SNV records according to specific gene loci. We classified the variants into the six mutation types: (A > T/T > A; A > G/T > C; T > G/A > C; C > T/G > A; G > T/C > A; C > G/G > C). Each mutation type was further distinguished in terms of the coding and the template strands, as previously introduced ( Haradhvala et al., 2016 38. Haradhvala, N.J. ∙ Polak, P. ∙ Stojanov, P. ... Mutational strand asymmetries in cancer genomes reveal mechanisms of DNA damage and repair Cell. 2016; 164 :538-549 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, we first split the processed SNV records file into mutation type-specific files according to the reference base (single base and triple bases) and mutation base, generating X > Y mutation type files and NXN > Y mutation type files, respectively. Second, we used the “bedmap–count” option in the bedops tool (version 2.4.35) to count the number of SNVs of each mutation type according to specific gene loci. The gene loci used in the analysis include: (1) Gene body, defined as the genomic interval between the gene start site and gene end site as annotated in the GTF file (Ensembl release 91); (2) Upstream 5kb and downstream 5kb regions, each defined according to gene body region and with reference to gene orientation information, respectively; (3) Intron regions, defined as the noncoding regions between coding-exon regions and are not covered by any isoform mRNA. According to this definition, we did not consider introns located in the 5′- or 3′-UTRs since these introns frequently have regulatory roles which are more likely under selection ( Barrett et al., 2012 7. Barrett, L.W. ∙ Fletcher, S. ∙ Wilton, S.D. Regulation of eukaryotic gene expression by the untranslated gene regions and other non-coding elements Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69 :3613-3634 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). For intronic regions, we additionally removed the splicing donor/acceptor consensus sequences – 6 bases on the 5′ end (splicing donor region) and 3 bases on the 3′ end (splicing acceptor region) – according to the gene orientation ( Matera and Wang, 2014 59. Matera, A.G. ∙ Wang, Z. A day in the life of the spliceosome Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 :108-121 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). With these strategies, we selected the intron regions containing the least level of natural selection pressure.
The mutation rates used throughout the paper were generally defined as SNV counts per kilobases, calculated by dividing SNV counts by the reference base counts and then multiply by 1000. According to this definition, the actual number (y axis in the plots) of the mutation rates would vary between the input file of the processed SNV records, since they have different total numbers of SNVs. Specifically, for germline mutations of a given gene locus, the mutation rates were calculated by dividing the sum of all SNVs (regardless of mutation types) by the count of all bases in the locus and then normalized to 1kb. The germline mutation rates of specific mutation type on the coding (Mut coding ) and on the template (Mut template ) stands were calculated by dividing SNV count by specific reference base count according to the strand information of the gene locus, respectively. The Mut coding and Mut template rates were all normalized to 1000 reference bases.
The asymmetry score of a specific mutation type between the coding strand and template strand of each gene was calculated as log 2 (Mut coding /Mut template ), where the Mut coding and Mut template represents the mutation rates on the coding and template strand, respectively. In rare cases, the asymmetry scores being zero or infinity were removed, since these numbers indicate that Mut coding or Mut template is zero, respectively. The same procedures were also performed on upstream and downstream genomic regions, with the strand specificity (coding strand versus template strand) being assigned in consistent with the corresponding genes.
Human gene family annotations were downloaded from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee ( https://www.genenames.org/data/genegroup/#!/ ). In total, 27 families contain more than 100 gene members. These families include: ‘Ankyrin repeat domain containing (ANKRD)’, ‘Armadillo-like helical domain containing (ARMH)’, ‘Basic helix-loop-helix proteins (BHLH)’, ‘BTB domain containing (BTBD)’, ‘Cadherins’, ‘CD molecules (CD)’, ‘EF-hand domain containing’, ‘Fibronectin type III domain containing’, ‘GPCR, Class A rhodopsin-like(excluding OR)’, ‘GPCR, Class A rhodopsin-like(Olfactory receptor)’, ‘Heat shock proteins’, ‘Helicases’, ‘Histones’, ‘Homeoboxes’, ‘Immunoglobulin superfamily domain containing’, channels’, ‘PDZ domain containing (PDZ)’, ‘PHD finger proteins’, ‘Pleckstrin homology domain containing (PLEKH)’, ‘Ras small GTPases superfamily’, ‘Ring finger proteins’, ‘RNA binding motif containing (RBM)’, ‘Solute carriers (SLC)’, ‘WD repeat domain containing (WDR)’, ‘Zinc fingers C2H2-type’, ‘Zinc fingers - other’, ‘T cell receptor gene’. We further selected these gene families by having at least 10 gene members in both expressed and unexpressed categories, as defined above. Additionally, we removed the ‘GPCR, Class A rhodopsin-like (Olfactory receptor)’ family because majority of the genes lack an intron region located between the coding sequences of the gene, preventing us from analyzing the neutral variants. Together these steps led to a list of 9 gene families as shown in Figures 2 C and S3 K. Germline SNV rates were calculated according to gene body regions ( Figure 2 C) or intron regions ( Figure S3 K) for each gene corresponding to a specific gene family.
We used the somatic cells determined from the current study to perform the control analysis of somatic cell expressed genes. Considering that the somatic cells were in a smaller fraction among all testicular cells and the cell number varied across somatic cell types, we restricted the set of expressed genes as being expressed in at least 5% of cells in each somatic cell type, or in all somatic cells.
The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx, release V7) gene expression profiles used in Figures 2 E and S1 I across 53 tissue/organ/cell samples were downloaded from the GTEx Portal ( https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets/ ). We used the expression profiles containing the median TPM by tissue ( GTEx_Analysis_2016-01-15_v7_RNASeQCv1.1.8_gene_median_tpm.gct.gz ). We first only selected the protein coding genes in the GTEx expression matrix for downstream analysis. In Figure S3 I, we used the cutoffs varied from 0.01 to 10 median TPM for counting the number of expressed protein-coding genes in each tissue/organ. To distinguish the expressed genes out of the unexpressed protein-coding genes for each tissue in Figure 2 E, we set the cutoff as 0.1 median TPM value as given from the GTEx Portal. For each tissue, a gene was defined as expressed if the expression level was ≥ 0.1, otherwise it was defined as unexpressed. Average germline SNV rates associating with each gene category for each tissue was then calculated and the ratio was further calculated between the unexpressed gene category versus the expressed category. These ratios were plotted as shown in Figure 2 E. Z-scores were calculated on these ratios and indicated in the plot.
We selected the single nucleotide DNMs defined from large scale trio-WGS studies on healthy families for extracting the DNMs which do not contain disease-associated biases. The selected datasets come from two large scale WGS studies involving healthy trios: Jónsson et al. (2017) 46. Jónsson, H. ∙ Sulem, P. ∙ Kehr, B. ... Parental influence on human germline de novo mutations in 1,548 trios from Iceland Nature. 2017; 549 :519-522 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar and An et al. (2018) 3. An, J.Y. ∙ Lin, K. ∙ Zhu, L. ... Genome-wide de novo risk score implicates promoter variation in autism spectrum disorder Science. 2018; 362 :eaat6576 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar . The Jónsson et al. (2017) 46. Jónsson, H. ∙ Sulem, P. ∙ Kehr, B. ... Parental influence on human germline de novo mutations in 1,548 trios from Iceland Nature. 2017; 549 :519-522 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar study included 1,548 trios from Iceland and detected 98,858 single nucleotide DNMs. The An et al. (2018) 3. An, J.Y. ∙ Lin, K. ∙ Zhu, L. ... Genome-wide de novo risk score implicates promoter variation in autism spectrum disorder Science. 2018; 362 :eaat6576 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar study included 1,902 trios assigned in the control group and detected 115,870 single nucleotide DNMs. Together, our DNM analysis incorporated 214,728 single nucleotide DNMs determined from the healthy trios. Following that, we applied the DNMs to the same pre-processing steps and counted the DNMs to the gene body of each gene. We then calculated the DNM rates at the gene level ( Figures 6 A and 6B) or considering the adjacent sequence contexts ( Figures 6 C–6G). We also compared the mutation rates calculated from population-wide SNVs and DNMs by scaling the DNM rates. The scaling was calculated by multiplying the ratio of total SNV number divided by total DNM number on the coding ( Figure 6 E) or template ( Figure 6 F) strand, respectively.
The sequence divergence datasets of human to apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, bonobo, orangutan and gibbon) were downloaded from Ensembl release 91. Percent divergences in Figures 7 and S7 were calculated as: Divergence = 100% − Identity (human to other apes). dN and dS values were also retrieved from Ensembl and we excluded genes with dN or dS being zero, which would bias the dN/dS calculation. The mean values shown in Figures 7 and S7 were computed after excluding outlier values, where an outlier value was defined as more than three scaled median absolute deviations (MAD) away from the median. For a set of divergence or dN/dS values made up with N genes, MAD is defined as: MAD = median (|A i − median(A)|), for i = 1,2,...,N.
Gene set enrichment analysis of unexpressed genes was done against the fast evolving genes or highly divergent genes. We first calculated the human-to-ape dN/dS values and divergence values, respectively, in a species-specific manner for each gene. Then the dN/dS value or divergence value for each gene was determined by averaging the values across the five ape species (NaN values were ignored in this step). Positive selection genes were determined by having an average dN/dS value > 1.0 across all five human-to-ape comparisons, generating a list of 864 genes. Highly divergent genes were determined as ranking in top 10% of divergence scores across all protein-coding genes, generating a list of 1975 genes.
Gene ontology (GO) term analysis were done with GOrilla (Gene Ontology enRIchment anaLysis and visuaLizAtion) online tool ( http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/ ) ( Eden et al., 2009 26. Eden, E. ∙ Navon, R. ∙ Steinfeld, I. ... GOrilla: a tool for discovery and visualization of enriched GO terms in ranked gene lists BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :48 Crossref Scopus (1497) PubMed Google Scholar ). Target gene lists and background gene lists were provided for performing GO term analysis on Biological Processes. The GOrilla program searches for GO terms enriched in the target gene list compared to the background set using standard hyper geometric statistics. The output GO terms were selected by setting p -value cutoff as < 10e-5, generating the lists of GO terms in the Table S7 .
Statistical significance was computed by the Mann-Whitney U test (also called rank-sum test) to test whether two groups of genes have distinct value distributions. The significance p -values of multiple tests were adjusted by Bonferroni method accordingly. Error bars in the plots represent 99% percent confidence intervals, calculated by bootstrap method sampling with replacement for 10,000 times on the input values of mutation rates or asymmetry scores of genes. We used default settings of bootci function in MATLAB to calculate the bootstrap confidence interval with bias-corrected and accelerated percentile method. We set ‘alpha’ to 0.01 to calculate 99% bootstrap confidence intervals around the mean values. For coding-template strand mutation rates comparison, we used paired-sample t test during which the outlier values were replaced with the previous non-outlier value to ensure an approximately normal distribution of the elements. Gene set enrichment p -values of unexpressed genes against the positive selection genes or highly divergent genes were done by hypergeometric test based on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the hypergeometric distribution.
The single cell RNA-seq results were deposited to NCBI GEO database with the accession code GSE125372. The data analysis codes related to the project are available on Github through the following link: https://github.com/xiabo821/TS_related_scripts .

Gene Ontology (GO) Terms Analysis of the Unexpressed Genes (Sheet 1) and Highly Expressed Genes (Sheet 2) during Human Spermatogenesis, Related to Figure 7 The GO term analysis was done by GOrilla (Eden et al., 2009). ‘FDR q-value’ is the corrected p values for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Enrichment (N, B, n, b) is defined as ‘Enrichment = (b/n) / (B/N)’. N, total number of genes; B, total number of genes associated with a specific GO term; n, number of genes in the input list; b, number of genes in the intersection. The highlighted GO terms were displayed in Figure 7A.
