Title: Enteric helminth coinfection enhances host susceptibility to neurotropic flaviviruses via a tuft cell-IL-4 receptor signaling axis


Abstract: Summary

Although enteric helminth infections modulate immunity to mucosal pathogens, their effects on systemic microbes remain less established. Here, we observe increased mortality in mice coinfected with the enteric helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) and West Nile virus (WNV). This enhanced susceptibility is associated with altered gut morphology and transit, translocation of commensal bacteria, impaired WNV-specific T cell responses, and increased virus infection in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. These outcomes were due to type 2 immune skewing, because coinfection in Stat6 −/− mice rescues mortality, treatment of helminth-free WNV-infected mice with interleukin (IL)-4 mirrors coinfection, and IL-4 receptor signaling in intestinal epithelial cells mediates the susceptibility phenotypes. Moreover, tuft cell-deficient mice show improved outcomes with coinfection, whereas treatment of helminth-free mice with tuft cell-derived cytokine IL-25 or ligand succinate worsens WNV disease. Thus, helminth activation of tuft cell-IL-4-receptor circuits in the gut exacerbates infection and disease of a neurotropic flavivirus.

Section: Introduction

More than two billion people in the world are infected with helminths ( Hotez et al., 2008 22. Hotez, P.J. ∙ Brindley, P.J. ∙ Bethony, J.M. ... Helminth infections: the great neglected tropical diseases J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 :1311-1321 Crossref Scopus (1145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Millions of years of coevolution have enabled helminths to evade mammalian host responses and persist without causing severe disease in most individuals ( Allen and Maizels, 2011 2. Allen, J.E. ∙ Maizels, R.M. Diversity and dialogue in immunity to helminths Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 :375-388 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ). A benefit of this commensal-like relationship to the mammalian host may be a tempered immune response, because eradication of helminths correlates with higher prevalence of dysregulated immune disorders such as asthma, allergy, and autoimmunity ( Cheng and Locksley, 2014 10. Cheng, L.E. ∙ Locksley, R.M. Allergic inflammation--innately homeostatic Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2014; 7 :a016352 PubMed Google Scholar ; Loke and Lim, 2015 36. Loke, P. ∙ Lim, Y.A. Helminths and the microbiota: parts of the hygiene hypothesis Parasite Immunol. 2015; 37 :314-323 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, helminth-endemic areas also have higher incidences of some systemic infections including HIV, malaria, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), raising the possibility that helminth infection can impair host immunity against certain pathogens ( Salgame et al., 2013 53. Salgame, P. ∙ Yap, G.S. ∙ Gause, W.C. Effect of helminth-induced immunity on infections with microbial pathogens Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :1118-1126 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Experimental evidence examining the influence of helminths on the host immune responses against viruses are few, and these studies have reported discordant findings.
Coinfection with enteric helminths may benefit the host response against respiratory viral infections ( Furze et al., 2006 17. Furze, R.C. ∙ Hussell, T. ∙ Selkirk, M.E. Amelioration of influenza-induced pathology in mice by coinfection with Trichinella spiralis Infect. Immun. 2006; 74 :1924-1932 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; McFarlane et al., 2017 39.

S. mansoni bolsters anti-viral immunity in the murine respiratory tract PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e112469 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Coinfection of mice with Trichinella spiralis and influenza A virus resulted in improved clinical outcome ( Furze et al., 2006 17. Furze, R.C. ∙ Hussell, T. ∙ Selkirk, M.E. Amelioration of influenza-induced pathology in mice by coinfection with Trichinella spiralis Infect. Immun. 2006; 74 :1924-1932 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the enteric helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) protected mice against respiratory syncytial virus ( McFarlane et al., 2017 39. McFarlane, A.J. ∙ McSorley, H.J. ∙ Davidson, D.J. ... Enteric helminth-induced type I interferon signaling protects against pulmonary virus infection through interaction with the microbiota J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2017; 140 :1068-1078.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, coinfection with helminths promoted viral replication after enteric infection with murine norovirus (MNoV) ( Osborne et al., 2014 47. Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ∙ Nice, T.J. ... Coinfection. Virus-helminth coinfection reveals a microbiota-independent mechanism of immunomodulation Science. 2014; 345 :578-582 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this was attributed to impaired virus-specific CD8 + T cells resulting from interleukin(IL)-4-mediated differentiation of macrophages and increased tuft cells numbers ( Osborne et al., 2014 47. Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ∙ Nice, T.J. ... Coinfection. Virus-helminth coinfection reveals a microbiota-independent mechanism of immunomodulation Science. 2014; 345 :578-582 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilen et al., 2018 72. Wilen, C.B. ∙ Lee, S. ∙ Hsieh, L.L. ... Tropism for tuft cells determines immune promotion of norovirus pathogenesis Science. 2018; 360 :204-208 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although another study also implicated IL-4-induced macrophages in reactivation of gammaherpesvirus infection ( Reese et al., 2014 50. Reese, T.A. ∙ Wakeman, B.S. ∙ Choi, H.S. ... Helminth infection reactivates latent γ-herpesvirus via cytokine competition at a viral promoter Science. 2014; 345 :573-577 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), others have suggested that IL-4 signaling can boost virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses and inhibit gammaherpesvirus infection during helminth coinfection ( Rolot et al., 2018 52. Rolot, M. ∙ Dougall, A.M. ∙ Chetty, A. ... Helminth-induced IL-4 expands bystander memory CD8 + T cells for early control of viral infection Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4516 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies highlight that helminth-virus coinfection can result in different outcomes depending on the virus, the site of infection, and the nature of protective immunity.
Tuft cells initiate type 2 immune responses against enteric helminths and protozoan parasites ( Gerbe et al., 2016 19. Gerbe, F. ∙ Sidot, E. ∙ Smyth, D.J. ... Intestinal epithelial tuft cells initiate type 2 mucosal immunity to helminth parasites Nature. 2016; 529 :226-230 Crossref Scopus (638) PubMed Google Scholar ; Howitt et al., 2016 23. Howitt, M.R. ∙ Lavoie, S. ∙ Michaud, M. ... Tuft cells, taste-chemosensory cells, orchestrate parasite type 2 immunity in the gut Science. 2016; 351 :1329-1333 Crossref Scopus (629) PubMed Google Scholar ; von Moltke et al., 2016 69. von Moltke, J. ∙ Ji, M. ∙ Liang, H.E. ... Tuft-cell-derived IL-25 regulates an intestinal ILC2-epithelial response circuit Nature. 2016; 529 :221-225 Crossref Scopus (849) PubMed Google Scholar ). On sensing these organisms, tuft cells produce IL-25, which activates group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in the lamina propria. ILC2s interact with dendritic cell (DC)-primed CD4 + T cells resulting in T helper (Th)2 cell differentiation ( Oliphant et al., 2014 46. Oliphant, C.J. ∙ Hwang, Y.Y. ∙ Walker, J.A. ... MHCII-mediated dialog between group 2 innate lymphoid cells and CD4(+) T cells potentiates type 2 immunity and promotes parasitic helminth expulsion Immunity. 2014; 41 :283-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both ILC2 and Th2 cells produce type 2 cytokines, which signal IL-4Rα-expressing intestinal epithelial progenitor cells in the crypts of the small intestine (SI) ( Gerbe et al., 2016 19. Gerbe, F. ∙ Sidot, E. ∙ Smyth, D.J. ... Intestinal epithelial tuft cells initiate type 2 mucosal immunity to helminth parasites Nature. 2016; 529 :226-230 Crossref Scopus (638) PubMed Google Scholar ; von Moltke et al., 2016 69. von Moltke, J. ∙ Ji, M. ∙ Liang, H.E. ... Tuft-cell-derived IL-25 regulates an intestinal ILC2-epithelial response circuit Nature. 2016; 529 :221-225 Crossref Scopus (849) PubMed Google Scholar ) and skew their differentiation toward goblet cell and tuft cell lineages. Type 2 cytokines also affect intestinal smooth muscle contractility and stimulate enteric neurons, which together with changes in the intestinal epithelial response, contribute to “the weep and sweep response” that facilitates worm expulsion ( Reynolds et al., 2012 51. Reynolds, L.A. ∙ Filbey, K.J. ∙ Maizels, R.M. Immunity to the model intestinal helminth parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus Semin. Immunopathol. 2012; 34 :829-846 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although such remodeling of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract prevents worm colonization ( Schneider et al., 2018 55. Schneider, C. ∙ O’Leary, C.E. ∙ von Moltke, J. ... A Metabolite-Triggered Tuft Cell-ILC2 Circuit Drives Small Intestinal Remodeling Cell. 2018; 174 :271-284.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ), its effects on other enteric and non-enteric pathogen infections remain less well studied.
Several medically important viruses comprise the Flavivirus genus including Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses ( Daep et al., 2014 11. Daep, C.A. ∙ Muñoz-Jordán, J.L. ∙ Eugenin, E.A. Flaviviruses, an expanding threat in public health: focus on dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis virus J. Neurovirol. 2014; 20 :539-560 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). These viruses are transmitted principally by arthropod vectors and collectively infect more than 400 million individuals each year ( Daep et al., 2014 11. Daep, C.A. ∙ Muñoz-Jordán, J.L. ∙ Eugenin, E.A. Flaviviruses, an expanding threat in public health: focus on dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis virus J. Neurovirol. 2014; 20 :539-560 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among them, WNV is a neurotropic flavivirus that continues to emerge globally. Although in most humans WNV infection is asymptomatic, ~10%–30% of individuals develop a febrile illness or neurological disease ( Daep et al., 2014 11. Daep, C.A. ∙ Muñoz-Jordán, J.L. ∙ Eugenin, E.A. Flaviviruses, an expanding threat in public health: focus on dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis virus J. Neurovirol. 2014; 20 :539-560 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some genetic factors (e.g., CCR5 Δ 32 and OAS1 alleles) are linked to susceptibility ( Bigham et al., 2011 5. Bigham, A.W. ∙ Buckingham, K.J. ∙ Husain, S. ... Host genetic risk factors for West Nile virus infection and disease progression PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e24745 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lindsey et al., 2012 34. Lindsey, N.P. ∙ Staples, J.E. ∙ Lehman, J.A. ... Medical risk factors for severe West Nile Virus disease, United States, 2008-2010 Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2012; 87 :179-184 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), but these do not explain the majority of severe WNV cases.
In addition to targeting neurons in the brain and spinal cord, WNV replicates in enteric neurons of the myenteric plexus, where infection results in neuronal injury and GI tract dysmotility ( White et al., 2018 71. White, J.P. ∙ Xiong, S. ∙ Malvin, N.P. ... Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Perturbations of the gut microbiota can modulate host resistance and susceptibility to flavivirus infection ( Thackray et al., 2018 63. Thackray, L.B. ∙ Handley, S.A. ∙ Gorman, M.J. ... Oral Antibiotic Treatment of Mice Exacerbates the Disease Severity of Multiple Flavivirus Infections Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :3440-3453.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains uncertain whether other factors, such as coinfection with helminths, could affect disease severity caused by WNV or other flaviviruses.
Here, we explored whether coinfection with the non-migrating enteric helminth Hpb modulates flavivirus-induced disease. Hpb is an endogenous mouse helminth that is widely used as a model for human intestinal hookworm infection ( Bouchery et al., 2017 7. Bouchery, T. ∙ Volpe, B. ∙ Shah, K. ... The Study of Host Immune Responses Elicited by the Model Murine Hookworms Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Heligmosomoides polygyrus Curr. Protoc. Mouse Biol. 2017; 7 :236-286 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). After oral gavage with the infective L3 larval stage, Hpb larvae penetrate the SI submucosa and undergo two developmental molts before emerging into the gut lumen as mature adults. The adult parasites coil around the intestinal villi, feed on the intestinal epithelium, mate, and produce eggs that are excreted in the feces. Although Hpb infection elicits a robust type 2 immune response that reduces the worm burden, it does not clear helminths, enabling persistent infection in C57BL/6 mice ( Reynolds et al., 2012 51. Reynolds, L.A. ∙ Filbey, K.J. ∙ Maizels, R.M. Immunity to the model intestinal helminth parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus Semin. Immunopathol. 2012; 34 :829-846 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We found that mice coinfected with Hpb and WNV had higher mortality rates compared to WNV- or Hpb-only infected mice, and this phenotype correlated with higher viral burden in coinfected mice. Coinfection in mice resulted in macroscopic changes to the SI, gut motility defects, and neuronal network changes. Histopathological analyses revealed alterations in the SI mucosa including crypt hyperplasia, villus blunting, and increased enterocyte turnover. These defects were associated with translocation of gut bacteria into the blood to the spleen, which resulted in the collapse of antiviral CD8 + T cell responses. Notably, Hpb and WNV coinfection did not cause these disease phenotypes in Stat6 −/− mice. Conversely, administration of IL-4-anti-IL-4 complexes (IL-4c) to helminth-free WNV-infected mice resulted in the same deleterious GI tract and systemic immune phenotypes as observed in coinfected mice. A lack of IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) expression on myeloid or hematopoietic cells did not alter WNV or GI tract disease in the context of Hpb coinfection, whereas a loss of IL-4Rα expression on intestinal epithelial cells mitigated disease and improved survival. Finally, mice lacking tuft cells showed improved survival, intact WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses, and an absence of gut pathology in the context of coinfection. Collectively, these results indicate that systemic infection with WNV in the presence of enteric helminth coinfection activates a tuft cell-type 2 immunity-intestinal epithelial cell circuit that damages the GI epithelial barrier, which results in translocation of gut bacteria, altered splenic architecture, and loss of virus-specific CD8 + T cells. Ultimately, this leads to enhanced WNV infection in the CNS and increased mortality in mice. As a similar pattern was observed with ZIKV or Powassan (POWV) coinfection, enteric helminths may enhance the disease severity of multiple neurotropic flaviviruses.

Section: Results

To assess the impact of enteric helminth infection on WNV pathogenesis, we gavaged 9-week-old C57BL/6J mice with infective third-stage Hpb larvae (L3), and 12 days later, inoculated them subcutaneously with WNV in the footpad ( Figure 1 A). Day 12 marks the onset of patency, when adult forms of Hpb emerge and mate in the intestinal lumen resulting in egg production. Coinfected mice were compared to mice infected with Hpb or WNV alone. Infection with Hpb alone had no adverse effect on survival or body weight, whereas infection with WNV alone resulted in an 86% survival rate and modest reductions in body weight ( Figures 1 B and 1C). In contrast, only 28% of coinfected mice survived by 20 days post-infection (dpi). Coinfected mice also displayed greater weight loss than mice infected with WNV or Hpb alone. Helminth infection also increased the susceptibility of mice to other neurotropic flaviviruses, including POWV and ZIKV ( Figures S1 A and S1B).
To begin to determine the cause of the greater mortality in coinfected mice, we examined the kinetics of WNV infection. Viral RNA was detected in the draining lymph nodes (DLN) of the foot as early as 1 dpi and was sustained until 10 dpi in both coinfected and WNV-only infected mice ( Figure 1 D). Viral RNA levels also were equivalent in the spleens of coinfected and WNV-only infected group at all time points ( Figure 1 E). Although we did not detect earlier virus dissemination to the CNS in coinfected mice, by 10 dpi, higher viral RNA levels were present in the brain and the spinal cord of coinfected than WNV-only infected mice ( Figures 1 F and 1G). Because WNV also has a tropism for the GI tract ( White et al., 2018 71. White, J.P. ∙ Xiong, S. ∙ Malvin, N.P. ... Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), we measured infection at this site. We observed higher viral titers at 10 dpi in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN), proximal SI, distal SI, and colon of coinfected mice ( Figures 1 H–1K) than WNV-only infected ( Figure 1 H) mice. These results show that Hpb infection affects WNV burden at later phases in the CNS and the GI tract, suggesting it impacts immune clearance. We also evaluated whether WNV reciprocally influenced the Hpb life cycle by measuring adult worm egg production in feces of mice. We observed no significant differences in egg burden at 3 and 6 dpi between coinfected or Hpb-only infected mice (15 and 18 days, respectively, post-inoculation with Hpb L3) ( Figures S1 C and S1D).
To corroborate the relationship between helminth infection and WNV infection outcome, we treated mice with pyrantel pamoate, an anti-helminthic drug. When Hpb-infected mice were gavaged with pyrantel pamoate prior to WNV infection, the egg burden was reduced to undetectable levels ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Because anti-helminthic treatment also abolished the enhanced mortality observed during Hpb and WNV coinfection ( Figure S1 G), helminth colonization likely is necessary for enhanced susceptibility to WNV infection.
Systemic infection of C57BL/6 mice with a highly pathogenic WNV strain (New York, 1999) results in dilation of intestinal segments and altered GI tract motility ( White et al., 2018 71. White, J.P. ∙ Xiong, S. ∙ Malvin, N.P. ... Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed fewer macroscopic changes to the SI at 10 dpi after inoculation with a WNV strain (New York, 2000) that is less pathogenic in mice ( Figure 2 A). In contrast, mice coinfected with Hpb and WNV New York 2000 showed marked changes in the GI tract, including dilation of the proximal segments of the SI, blackening of the bowel, and tissue friability. Moreover, the distal section of the SI and the entire colon appeared void of luminal contents, a sign of gut dysmotility ( Figure 2 A). We measured intestinal transit times of a carmine dye in animals that were uninfected, singly infected (Hpb or WNV), or coinfected. At 2 dpi, there were no differences between the groups ( Figure 2 B). By 6 dpi, transit delays were apparent in a subset of WNV-only and coinfected mice ( Figure 2 C). By 10 dpi, ~70% of coinfected mice showed marked delays (>6 h) in GI motility, whereas this extent of dysmotility was observed in ~20% of WNV-only infected mice ( Figure 2 D).
WNV preferentially infects enteric neurons of the myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus in the GI tract ( White et al., 2018 71. White, J.P. ∙ Xiong, S. ∙ Malvin, N.P. ... Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if Hpb coinfection alters the WNV tropism in the GI tract, we co-stained for WNV antigen and Tuj1, a pan-neuronal marker in the SI. We found WNV antigen principally in neuronal cells of the muscularis layer in coinfected mice ( Figure S2 A), as seen previously ( White et al., 2018 71. White, J.P. ∙ Xiong, S. ∙ Malvin, N.P. ... Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine this in more detail, we stained whole-mount preparations of the proximal SI muscularis propria and submucosa. We co-stained for WNV antigen and neuronal markers, nNOS and calretinin, which respectively delineate inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Higher levels of WNV antigen were apparent in coinfected than WNV-only infected mice and localized with neuronal ganglia (both nNOS and calretinin) of the myenteric and submucosal plexus ( Figures 2 E, 2F, S2 B, and S2C). Similar results were observed in the mid SI ( Figure 2 G). WNV coinfection also affected the enteric neuronal network, as reduced intensity and density of nNOS and calretinin staining was apparent in the myenteric plexus compared to naive, WNV-only, or Hpb-only infected mice ( Figures 2 H–2J).
Tissue-resident macrophages associate with enteric neuronal ganglia and are implicated in sepsis-induced dysmotility and diabetes-induced gastroparesis ( Muller et al., 2020 42. Muller, P.A. ∙ Matheis, F. ∙ Mucida, D. Gut macrophages: key players in intestinal immunity and tissue physiology Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2020; 62 :54-61 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine the effect of coinfection on the macrophage response, we analyzed their distribution in the proximal SI. In naive mice, macrophages were dispersed and had a stellate morphology, whereas in Hpb-infected mice, they were spindly and occupied more area ( Figure S2 D). In WNV-infected mice, macrophages were more elongated and accumulated near WNV antigen-positive cells ( Figure S2 D). These changes in morphology and positioning were more pronounced in coinfected mice. A macrophage response in coinfected mice may occur to limit neuronal loss, as a prior study indicated their importance in preventing bacterial infection-induced neuronal death ( Matheis et al., 2020 38. Matheis, F. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Graves, C.L. ... Adrenergic Signaling in Muscularis Macrophages Limits Infection-Induced Neuronal Loss Cell. 2020; 180 :64-78.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We analyzed SI tissue sections for pathological changes during Hpb and WNV coinfection at 10 dpi (corresponding to 22 days after Hpb inoculation). Mice infected with WNV or Hpb alone showed only modest reductions in villus height in the proximal SI ( Figure 3 A). In contrast, coinfected mice showed a dramatic change in mucosal architecture throughout the proximal SI ( Figure 3 A). The height of villi in coinfected mice was reduced in comparison with naive and Hpb or WNV-only infected mice ( Figures 3 A and 3B). The villus morphology in coinfected mice showed epithelial cellular crowding and focal tufting ( Figure 3 A). Shorter villi are commonly associated with diminished epithelial stem/progenitor cell activity ( Lee et al., 2009 31. Lee, G. ∙ White, L.S. ∙ Hurov, K.E. ... Response of small intestinal epithelial cells to acute disruption of cell division through CDC25 deletion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :4701-4706 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the coinfected mice showed greater crypt depth and epithelial proliferation as measured by the number of M-phase cells, suggesting that cellular turnover in the villi was accelerated ( Figures 3 A, 3C, and 3E). As further evidence of greater epithelial turnover in coinfected mice, we observed increased cell death as judged by TUNEL staining in the proximal SI at 10 dpi ( Figures S3 C and S3D). Despite the severity of the mucosal epithelial abnormalities, we did not detect areas of mucosal ulceration or inflammation. The pathological phenotype in the coinfected mice was greatest in the proximal SI and diminished along the length of the remainder of the SI ( Figures S3 A and S3B), which correlates with the localization of Hpb infection ( Johnston et al., 2015 26. Johnston, C.J. ∙ Robertson, E. ∙ Harcus, Y. ... Cultivation of Heligmosomoides polygyrus: an immunomodulatory nematode parasite and its secreted products J. Vis. Exp. 2015; e52412 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Histological features similar to that seen in coinfected mice have been observed in human pathological conditions and mice with reduced barrier function ( Kau et al., 2015 27. Kau, A.L. ∙ Planer, J.D. ∙ Liu, J. ... Functional characterization of IgA-targeted bacterial taxa from undernourished Malawian children that produce diet-dependent enteropathy Sci. Transl.

Identification of EpCAM as the gene for congenital tufting enteropathy Gastroenterology. 2008; 135 :429-437 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ; Szabo et al., 2019 62. Szabo, R. ∙ Callies, L.K. ∙ Bugge, T.H. Matriptase drives early-onset intestinal failure in a mouse model of congenital tufting enteropathy Development. 2019; 146 :dev183392 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). To evaluate whether structural changes to the SI mucosa associated with coinfection might disrupt the GI tract barrier and allow commensal bacterial translocation, we measured bacteria in the spleen of coinfected mice and compared this to naive mice or mice infected with WNV or Hpb alone. At 2 dpi, aerobic bacteria did not grow from splenic homogenates ( Figure 3 F). However, at 6 dpi, we detected low levels of bacteria growing from the splenic homogenates of coinfected mice ( Figure 3 G), and by 10 dpi, the majority of samples from coinfected mice grew bacteria, whereas those from other groups of mice did not ( Figure 3 H). Analogous results were observed in the blood at 10 dpi ( Figure 3 I). These effects on barrier permeability were confirmed using an orally administered fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran, which showed higher levels of intestinal permeability in coinfected mice than singly infected mice at 10 dpi ( Figure S3 E).
Because antiviral CD8 + T cells contribute to clearance of WNV infection ( Shrestha and Diamond, 2004 57. Shrestha, B. ∙ Diamond, M.S. Role of CD8+ T cells in control of West Nile virus infection J. Virol. 2004; 78 :8312-8321 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that the viral burden differences we observed at 10 dpi between coinfected mice and WNV-infected mice might be due to effects on T cell responses. To address this question, we measured CD8 + T cell responses in coinfected and WNV-only infected mice using D b -restricted NS4B tetramers, which recognize WNV-specific CD8 + T cells ( Purtha et al., 2007 49. Purtha, W.E. ∙ Myers, N. ∙ Mitaksov, V. ... Antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes protect against lethal West Nile virus encephalitis Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37 :1845-1854 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). At 7 dpi, the percentages and numbers of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in the spleen and the brain were equivalent between the groups ( Figures 4 A and 4B). In the MLN, WNV-specific CD8 + T cell numbers were higher in the coinfected group than the WNV-only infected group ( Figure 4 C). However, at 10 dpi, the percentage and number of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in the spleen of coinfected mice were markedly reduced compared to WNV-only infected mice ( Figure 4 D). Similar results were observed in the brain at 10 dpi ( Figure 4 E) despite the higher viral loads ( Figure 1 F). However, WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in the MLNs remained comparable between the two groups at 10 dpi ( Figure 4 F). Thus, although the early WNV-specific CD8 + T cell response is induced normally, there is a decline by 10 dpi in some organs of coinfected mice.
We assessed whether the waning WNV-specific CD8 + T cell response at 10 dpi in coinfected mice was due to effects on proliferation, differentiation, or cell death. At 7 dpi, the expression of Ki67, a cell proliferation marker, was similar between WNV-specific CD8 + T cells of coinfected and WNV-only infected mice ( Figure 4 G). WNV-specific CD8 + T cells from both groups also expressed similar levels of the T-box transcription factor T-bet, suggesting that differentiation was not altered ( Figure 4 H). Analogous results were observed in WNV-specific CD8 + T cells from the DLN at 7 dpi ( Figures S4 A and S4B). The differentiation of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells into terminal effectors [KLRG1 hi CD127 lo ] and memory precursors [KLRG1 lo CD127 hi ] also was similar between the groups at 7 dpi ( Figure 4 I). To examine if the reduction in WNV-CD8 + T cell response at 10 dpi was due to altered survival, we stained cells for annexin V, a marker of cell apoptosis, at 8 dpi. As expected, in naive mice, most of the CD8 + T cells [90%] were non-apoptotic [live/dead neg annexinV neg ] with few in the early [live/dead neg annexinV pos ] or late [live/dead pos annexinV pos ] stages of apoptosis ( Figure 4 J). In WNV-only infected mice, virus-specific CD8 + T cells were distributed evenly between non, early, and late apoptotic stages ( Figure 4 J). This pattern is expected because a proportion of effector CD8 + T cells undergo contraction after WNV clearance ( Aguilar-Valenzuela et al., 2018 1. Aguilar-Valenzuela, R. ∙ Netland, J. ∙ Seo, Y.J. ... Dynamics of Tissue-Specific CD8 + T Cell Responses during West Nile Virus Infection J. Virol. 2018; 92 :e00014-18 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In coinfected mice, however, a higher percentage of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells were in the late stage of apoptosis and undergoing cell death ( Figure 4 J). This suggests that the attrition of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells is due in part to impaired survival. When annexin V expression was assessed on bulk CD8 + T cells, major differences were not seen between the two groups ( Figure S4 C). Thus, the survival defect likely is specific for the antigen-experienced CD8 + T cells in coinfected mice.
To elucidate the basis for enhanced cell death of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells during coinfection, we visualized the organization of the spleen at 7 and 10 dpi by confocal microscopy. Naive mice showed a clear demarcation of B cell follicles (B220 + ; purple) and T cell zones (CD8 + ; green) ( Figure 4 K). Hpb-infected mice showed cellular infiltration in the T cell zones, as an overlap between DCs and T cells was visible. In comparison, WNV-only and coinfected mice showed minimal co-localization between DCs and CD8 + T cells at the 7-dpi time point ( Figure 4 K). By 10 dpi, we detected co-localization of DCs and T cells in WNV-only infected mice, but not in coinfected mice ( Figure 4 L).
To examine whether DCs and other immune cells are impacted by Hpb and WNV coinfection, we quantified their numbers. We observed an ~3.5-fold reduction in number of splenocytes in coinfected compared to WNV-infected mice, and a similar trend was noted for B cells, CD4 + T cell subsets, and CD8 + T cells ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Among innate immune cells, greater reductions were observed for natural killer cells than neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, or macrophages in coinfected compared to WNV-only infected mice ( Figure S4 F). DCs in coinfected mice also were reduced compared to WNV-only infected mice ( Figure S4 F). Thus, the lack of microscopic overlap between DCs and T cells observed in the spleens of coinfected mice may be due to decreases in DC numbers.
We also examined the expression of the stromal cell marker ERTR7, follicular DC marker CD21/35, and marginal zone macrophage (MZM) marker CD169 in the spleen at 10 dpi. Coinfected mice had reduced ERTR7 expression, indicating a disruption of splenic architecture ( Figure S4 G). In contrast, expression of CD169 and accumulation of MZMs was greater in coinfected mice than other groups ( Figure S4 G). This effect may be a response to the bacteria observed in the spleen of coinfected mice ( Figure 3 H), because MZMs capture bacteria ( Borges da Silva et al., 2015 6. Borges da Silva, H. ∙ Fonseca, R. ∙ Pereira, R.M. ... Splenic Macrophage Subsets and Their Function during Blood-Borne Infections Front.

CD169 + macrophages orchestrate innate immune responses by regulating bacterial localization in the spleen Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaah5520 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Altogether, our experiments suggest that the early cellular immune response (up to 7 dpi) is intact and comparable between the groups. However, later in infection (10 dpi), the splenic architecture of coinfected mice becomes altered, likely due to bacterial invasion, which impacts key immune cell types including DCs and WNV-specific CD8 + T cells that are important for viral clearance ( Hildner et al., 2008 21.

Infection with enteric helminths induces a Th2 response that depends on signaling by the transcription factor STAT6 ( Reynolds et al., 2012 51. Reynolds, L.A. ∙ Filbey, K.J. ∙ Maizels, R.M. Immunity to the model intestinal helminth parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus Semin. Immunopathol. 2012; 34 :829-846 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2001 73.

Immunol. 2001; 166 :7276-7281 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). As reported previously with other helminths ( Urban et al., 1998 65. Urban, Jr., J.F. ∙ Noben-Trauth, N. ∙ Donaldson, D.D. ... IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, and Stat6 are required for the expulsion of the gastrointestinal nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis Immunity. 1998; 8 :255-264 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar , 2000 66. Urban, Jr., J.F. ∙ Schopf, L. ∙ Morris, S.C. ... Stat6 signaling promotes protective immunity against Trichinella spiralis through a mast cell- and T cell-dependent mechanism J. Immunol. 2000; 164 :2046-2052 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ), enteric infection of Stat6 −/− mice with Hpb results in increased parasite egg burden compared to wild-type (WT) mice ( Figure S5 A) due to impaired Th2 responses in the MLN and spleen ( Figure S5 B). In comparison, CD25 + FoxP3 + regulatory CD4 + T cell responses in lymphoid tissues are similar in Stat6 −/− and WT mice ( Figure S5 C). To determine if type 2 immune responses contribute to the lethality observed after coinfection, we infected WT and Stat6 −/− mice. All Stat6 −/− and WT mice survived Hpb infection alone, and most animals also survived WNV infection alone (82% for WT and 79% for Stat6 −/− mice) ( Figure 5 A). However, the increased lethality observed during coinfection of WT mice was not observed in Stat6 −/− mice (13% for WT and 70% survival for Stat6 −/− mice). When we examined the viral burden in WNV-infected and coinfected Stat6 −/− mice at 10 dpi, no significant differences were observed in the spleen, brain, spinal cord, and GI tract ( Figure 5 B). Thus, a deficiency of STAT6 prevents the increase in WNV burden and mortality caused by Hpb coinfection.
We assessed whether a deficiency in STAT6 rescued coinfected mice from the gut abnormalities observed in WT mice. The macroscopic changes associated with coinfection in WT mice ( Figure 3 A) were absent in Stat6 −/− mice ( Figure 5 C). At 10 dpi, many of the coinfected Stat6 −/− mice did not develop bowel dysmotility, as GI transit times were comparable to Stat6 −/− mice infected with WNV or Hpb alone ( Figure 5 D). The coinfected or WNV-only infected Stat6 −/− mice also showed low, if any, levels of bacteria in their spleens ( Figure 5 E) and similar numbers of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells at 10 dpi ( Figure 5 F). Thus, coinfection-associated gut abnormalities and defective WNV-specific immune responses require STAT6-mediated signaling events.
To determine whether the defect in WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in coinfected mice was due to systemic translocation of gut bacteria, we inhibited bacterial dissemination by administering meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, twice daily via intraperitoneal route (i.p.) route starting at day 5 after WNV infection ( Figure 5 G). Meropenem treatment did not greatly affect an established CD8 + T cell response in WNV-only infected mice but did rescue WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses in coinfected mice ( Figure 5 H). The reversal in antiviral CD8 + T cell response correlated with reduced bacterial burden in the spleen and similar trends were observed in the blood of meropenem-treated coinfected mice ( Figures 5 I and 5J). To corroborate these findings, we depleted gut bacteria with oral antibiotics (vancomycin, neomycin, and ampicillin [VNA]) beginning at day 5 after WNV infection, and then examined effects on WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses ( Figure S5 D). Oral VNA treatment administered 5 days after viral infection had little impact on the numbers WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in WNV-only infected mice ( Figure S5 E). However, and similar to results with meropenem, oral VNA treatment rescued WNV-specific CD8 + T cell defects in coinfected mice, and this result correlated with diminished bacterial burden in blood and spleen ( Figures S5 E and S5G). Collectively, these data suggest that dissemination of gut bacteria to lymphoid tissues is largely responsible for the impaired WNV-specific CD8 + T cell response during coinfection.
IL-4, which activates STAT6, is a cytokine involved in polarization of type 2 responses ( Finkelman et al., 2000 16. Finkelman, F.D. ∙ Morris, S.C. ∙ Orekhova, T. ... Stat6 regulation of in vivo IL-4 responses J. Immunol. 2000; 164 :2303-2310 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of the dependence of the coinfection phenotypes on STAT6, we tested the impact of IL-4 signaling on WNV pathogenesis in the absence of Hpb coinfection. We pre-treated WT mice with IL-4c via an i.p. route for 2 days, which results in sustained release of IL-4 ( Jenkins et al., 2011 24. Jenkins, S.J. ∙ Ruckerl, D. ∙ Cook, P.C. ... Local macrophage proliferation, rather than recruitment from the blood, is a signature of TH2 inflammation Science. 2011; 332 :1284-1288 Crossref Scopus (1099) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following day, IL-4c- or PBS-treated control mice were inoculated with WNV and then monitored ( Figure 6 A). Mice receiving IL-4c and WNV had less survival (20%) and greater weight loss than mice treated with PBS and infected with WNV or treated with IL-4c alone ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Similarly, IL-4c treatment also resulted in higher lethality rates after POWV infection ( Figure S6 A). At 10 dpi, we observed higher WNV burden in the brain, in the spinal cord, and throughout the GI tract of mice given IL-4c and WNV than in the WNV-only infected group ( Figure 6 D). The combination of IL-4c treatment and WNV or POWV infection resulted in similar macroscopic changes as seen during coinfection, including dilated and blackened bowel ( Figures 6 E and S6 B). The GI transit time of mice treated with IL-4c and infected with WNV was greater than mice treated with IL-4c alone and trended higher than mice infected with WNV alone ( Figure 6 F). Mice treated with IL-4c, infected with WNV, and then given FITC-dextran by oral gavage at 10 dpi also showed higher levels in serum than WNV-only infected mice indicating greater intestinal permeability ( Figure S6 C). At 10 dpi, we found markedly reduced numbers of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in infected mice receiving IL-4c ( Figure 6 G). Finally, we confirmed that the effects of IL-4c treatment on WNV pathogenesis required STAT6 signaling, as Stat6 −/− mice treated with IL-4c did not show enhanced lethality or abnormal gut morphology ( Figures 6 H and 6I).
To determine whether viral tropism for GI tract tissues in the presence of type 2 immune skewing is necessary to cause defects in CD8 + T cell response, we assessed the impact of IL-4c treatment on lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV, Armstrong strain), which does not appreciably infect the GI tract ( Beura et al., 2015 4. Beura, L.K. ∙ Anderson, K.G. ∙ Schenkel, J.M. ... Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus persistence promotes effector-like memory differentiation and enhances mucosal T cell distribution J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 97 :217-225 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subcutaneous inoculation of mice in the foot generated a robust LCMV-specific CD8 + T cells response in the spleen, which was minimally (2-fold) reduced by IL-4c treatment ( Figure S6 D). Moreover, IL-4c treatment did not cause bacteremia, bacterial infection in the spleen, or macroscopic gut pathology in LCMV-infected mice ( Figures S6 E–S6G). These data suggest that type 2 immune skewing by itself has relatively minor compromising effects on antiviral CD8 + T cell responses.
To address how type 2 responses induced during enteric helminth infection enhance susceptibility to WNV, we performed coinfection experiments in mice with a conditional deletion of the α-subunit of the IL-4 receptor (IL-4Rα). Prior studies implicated helminth-induced M2 macrophages, activated through IL-4Rα signaling, in enhanced susceptibility to Mtb , MNoV, and murine gammaherpesvirus ( Monin et al., 2015 40. Monin, L. ∙ Griffiths, K.L. ∙ Lam, W.Y. ... Helminth-induced arginase-1 exacerbates lung inflammation and disease severity in tuberculosis J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :4699-4713 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ; Osborne et al., 2014 47. Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ∙ Nice, T.J. ... Coinfection. Virus-helminth coinfection reveals a microbiota-independent mechanism of immunomodulation Science. 2014; 345 :578-582 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reese et al., 2014 50. Reese, T.A. ∙ Wakeman, B.S. ∙ Choi, H.S. ... Helminth infection reactivates latent γ-herpesvirus via cytokine competition at a viral promoter Science. 2014; 345 :573-577 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether this mechanism regulates disease after Hpb and WNV coinfection, we generated LysM-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice, which delete Il4ra in macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and some DCs ( Shi et al., 2018 56. Shi, J. ∙ Hua, L. ∙ Harmer, D. ... Cre Driver Mice Targeting Macrophages Methods Mol. Biol. 2018; 1784 :263-275 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a control, we also inoculated these mice with WNV or Hpb alone. We found no differences in susceptibility when LysM-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice were singly infected with WNV or Hpb compared to Cre − IL-4Rα fl/fl controls. When LysM-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice were coinfected with Hpb and WNV, 30% of them survived, similar to the Cre - IL-4Rα fl/fl control mice ( Figure 7 A), with both groups showing macroscopic changes in gut morphology at 10 dpi ( Figure 7 B). We infected Vav-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice, which lack IL-4Rα expression on all hematopoietic cell lineages and endothelial cells ( Georgiades et al., 2002 18. Georgiades, P. ∙ Ogilvy, S. ∙ Duval, H. ... VavCre transgenic mice: a tool for mutagenesis in hematopoietic and endothelial lineages Genesis. 2002; 34 :251-256 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ogilvy et al., 1998 45. Ogilvy, S. ∙ Elefanty, A.G. ∙ Visvader, J. ... Transcriptional regulation of vav, a gene expressed throughout the hematopoietic compartment Blood. 1998; 91 :419-430 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Again, WNV or Hpb infection alone did not result in enhanced lethality in Vav-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice compared to the control Cre − IL-4Rα fl/fl mice. Coinfection showed similarly enhanced lethality and macroscopic changes in the GI tract of both Vav-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl and Cre − IL-4Rα fl/fl mice ( Figures 7 C and 7D). We next infected Villin-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice, which deletes Il4ra in intestinal epithelial cells. When Villin-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice were inoculated with WNV or Hpb alone, no differences in survival were observed compared to control Cre − IL-4Rα fl/fl mice. However, when Villin-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice were coinfected, they failed to develop the increased lethality ( Figure 7 E) or macroscopic alterations of the GI tract ( Figure 7 F) unlike the control Cre − IL-4Rα fl/fl mice. Thus, IL-4 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells contributes to Hpb-induced susceptibility to WNV infection and disease.
To corroborate these results, we tested whether the increased susceptibility to WNV during IL-4c treatment also required IL-4Rα expression in intestinal epithelial cells. When Cre − IL-4Rα fl/fl control mice were treated with IL-4c and infected with WNV, 10% of them survived. In contrast, 90% of the Villin-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl mice survived IL-4c treatment and WNV infection ( Figure 7 G) and did not sustain the macroscopic GI changes observed at 10 dpi ( Figure 7 H). Thus, and similar to the coinfection experiments, enhanced IL-4c-mediated susceptibility to WNV infection requires IL-4Rα expression on intestinal epithelial cells.
Type 2 immune responses following helminth infection result in expansion of ILC2 and Th2 immune cells and production of cytokines, including IL-4 ( Allen and Maizels, 2011 2. Allen, J.E. ∙ Maizels, R.M. Diversity and dialogue in immunity to helminths Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11 :375-388 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, Hpb-infection resulted in increased ILC2 and Th2 cell numbers and higher IL-4 levels in the MLNs compared to uninfected or WNV-only infected mice ( Figures S7 A–S7C). However, type 2 immune responses were not changed by WNV infection, because both Hpb-infected and coinfected mice had comparable levels of ILC2 and Th2 cells and IL-4, consistent with the equivalent numbers of Hpb eggs in the stool of these mice ( Figures S1 D and S7 A–S7C).
Type 2 immune responses in the GI tract are initiated by tuft cells, a specialized intestinal cell lineage that detects colonization by helminths ( Gerbe et al., 2016 19. Gerbe, F. ∙ Sidot, E. ∙ Smyth, D.J. ... Intestinal epithelial tuft cells initiate type 2 mucosal immunity to helminth parasites Nature. 2016; 529 :226-230 Crossref Scopus (638) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether tuft cells contribute to the Hpb and WNV coinfection phenotypes, we utilized Pou2f3 −/− mice that specifically lack tuft cells ( Gerbe et al., 2016 19. Gerbe, F. ∙ Sidot, E. ∙ Smyth, D.J. ... Intestinal epithelial tuft cells initiate type 2 mucosal immunity to helminth parasites Nature. 2016; 529 :226-230 Crossref Scopus (638) PubMed Google Scholar ). Infection of Pou2f3 −/− mice with Hpb alone did not result in mortality, and infection with WNV alone resulted in 75% survival, similar to WT mice (81%) ( Figure 7 I). Coinfection with Hpb and WNV in Pou2f3 −/− mice, however, did not result in enhanced mortality, morphological changes in the GI tract, or impaired WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses ( Figures 7 I–7K). Furthermore, WNV antigen staining of enteric neurons of the myenteric plexus was not enhanced in Pou2f3 − /− Hpb and WNV coinfected mice, which correlated with an intact neuronal network ( Figures S7 D–S7F). Thus, tuft cells are required for the Hpb-mediated enhanced disease following WNV infection. Because IL-4/IL-13 signaling in the GI tract epithelium occurs downstream of tuft cell activation during helminth infection ( Ting and von Moltke, 2019 64. Ting, H.A. ∙ von Moltke, J. The Immune Function of Tuft Cells at Gut Mucosal Surfaces and Beyond J. Immunol. 2019; 202 :1321-1329 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested whether IL-4c treatment bypasses the need for tuft cells to cause enhanced lethality. Indeed, IL-4c treatment and WNV infection in Pou2f3 −/− mice resulted in lower survival rates (18%) similar to WT mice ( Figure S7 G). Pou2f3 −/− mice that received a combination of IL-4c and WNV also showed gut pathology at 10 dpi, whereas WNV-infection or IL-4c treatment alone of Pou2f3 −/− mice did not ( Figure S7 H). Together, these results indicate that a tuft cell-IL-4Rα-intestinal epithelial cell signaling axis is required for Hpb-mediated exacerbated disease following WNV infection.
Tuft cells initiate type 2 responses by secreting the cytokine IL-25 ( von Moltke et al., 2016 69. von Moltke, J. ∙ Ji, M. ∙ Liang, H.E. ... Tuft-cell-derived IL-25 regulates an intestinal ILC2-epithelial response circuit Nature. 2016; 529 :221-225 Crossref Scopus (849) PubMed Google Scholar ). On Hpb infection, IL-25 levels in the SI were greater than in uninfected mice and not affected by WNV infection ( Figure S7 I). We determined whether the tuft cell-derived type 2 cytokine IL-25 enhances WNV susceptibility in the absence of helminth coinfection. When WT mice were treated with recombinant IL-25 and inoculated with WNV, 10% of mice survived through 11 dpi whereas 86% of the PBS-treated group survived WNV infection ( Figure 7 L). Mice receiving IL-25 and WNV also showed macroscopic GI changes at 10 dpi ( Figure 7 M). Among intestinal epithelial cells, tuft cells selectively express the succinate receptor SUCNR1, and succinate sensing can initiate the tuft cell-ILC2 circuit ( Nadjsombati et al., 2018 43. Nadjsombati, M.S. ∙ McGinty, J.W. ∙ Lyons-Cohen, M.R. ... Detection of Succinate by Intestinal Tuft Cells Triggers a Type 2 Innate Immune Circuit Immunity. 2018; 49 :33-41.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether lumenal succinate sensing alters susceptibility to WNV, we provided helminth-free WT mice with succinate in drinking water 1 week before WNV inoculation and throughout the time course of the experiment. All succinate-treated mice died following WNV infection by 12 dpi ( Figure 7 N), and this was associated with similar macroscopic GI changes observed with coinfection, IL-4c treatment, or IL-25 treatment ( Figure 7 O). However, succinate-treated Pou2f3 −/− mice survived WNV infection and did not show the severe gut pathology, suggesting that succinate signals via tuft cells to enhance GI tract susceptibility to WNV ( Figures 7 N and 7O). Finally, succinate receptor-deficient mice ( Sucnr1 −/− ) lacked macroscopic gut pathology or altered WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses following WNV and Hpb coinfection ( Figures S7 J and S7K). Collectively, these results suggest that Hpb-mediated activation of type 2 responses in intestinal epithelial cells depends on tuft cells and is possibly initiated by succinate sensing.

Section: Discussion

We established that coinfection with an enteric helminth enhances host susceptibility to WNV, a mosquito-transmitted neuroinvasive pathogen. Coinfection of mice with Hpb and WNV resulted in elevated viral burden in GI tract and CNS tissues and greater mortality. Enteric neurons of the myenteric plexus were infected with WNV to a greater extent in coinfected mice resulting in altered neuronal networks. Profound macroscopic and microscopic changes were apparent in the GI tract of coinfected mice, with barrier defects facilitating the translocation of commensal bacteria into circulation. As a consequence, the splenic architecture likely was disrupted, and WNV-specific CD8 + T cells responses collapsed. Coinfection in Stat6 −/− mice and IL-4c treatment indicated that helminth-induced type 2 responses were responsible for the increased mortality and associated pathology. Unexpectedly, deletion of IL-4Rα from intestinal epithelium, and not from hematopoietic cells, rescued coinfected mice from increased WNV susceptibility. Thus, type 2 signaling within intestinal epithelium is critical for this pathological circuit. Finally, Pou2f3 −/− or Sucnr1 −/− mice that lack tuft cells or succinate receptors were protected from coinfection-induced mortality and GI tract disease, whereas treatment of helminth-free mice with the tuft cell-derived cytokine IL-25 or tuft cell ligand succinate enhanced WNV disease. These findings suggest that coinfection with enteric helminths can enhance host vulnerability to severe systemic flavivirus infections via activation of a succinate-tuft cell-IL-25-IL-4R-intestinal circuit. Type 2 immune responses may condition the enteric neurons to become more susceptible to WNV infection and injury, which could affect signals that regulate epithelial cell regeneration ( Vergnolle and Cirillo, 2018 68. Vergnolle, N. ∙ Cirillo, C. Neurons and Glia in the Enteric Nervous System and Epithelial Barrier Function Physiology (Bethesda). 2018; 33 :269-280 PubMed Google Scholar ), gut morphology, barrier function, and the ensuing systemic adaptive antiviral responses to neurotropic flavivirus infection (modeled in Figure S8 ).
Prior studies reported that enteric helminth coinfection can be beneficial to the host for respiratory viral infections and detrimental for an enteric virus infection ( Furze et al., 2006 17. Furze, R.C. ∙ Hussell, T. ∙ Selkirk, M.E. Amelioration of influenza-induced pathology in mice by coinfection with Trichinella spiralis Infect. Immun. 2006; 74 :1924-1932 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; McFarlane et al., 2017 39. McFarlane, A.J. ∙ McSorley, H.J. ∙ Davidson, D.J. ...

Scheer, S. ∙ Krempl, C. ∙ Kallfass, C. ... S. mansoni bolsters anti-viral immunity in the murine respiratory tract PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e112469 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). We showed that enteric helminth coinfection with neuroinvasive flaviviruses that have tropism for the GI tract can worsen disease severity and outcome. An emerging theme from these studies is that if the helminth and virus co-infect a common tissue, the outcome is detrimental. This may be because helminths and viruses evoke disparate immune responses. The tissue infected with a helminth must switch rapidly from a type 2 to a type 1 immune response to curtail replication of a nascent viral infection. Likely, the type 2 immune program induced by the helminth impairs local antiviral responses resulting in failure of virus containment. Moreover, induction of proinflammatory mediators in response to virus infection could worsen the wound healing response to helminth-induced damage ( Allen and Sutherland, 2014 3. Allen, J.E. ∙ Sutherland, T.E. Host protective roles of type 2 immunity: parasite killing and tissue repair, flip sides of the same coin Semin.

Inflammatory cells during wound repair: the good, the bad and the ugly Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15 :599-607 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1056) PubMed Google Scholar ). In support of this hypothesis, the outcome of respiratory virus coinfection was deleterious when certain helminths ( Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or Ascaris suum ) migrate into the lungs ( Nayak and Kelley, 1965 44.

I. Influence of Nematode on Virus J. Parasitol. 1966; 52 :242-247 Crossref Google Scholar ). Similarly, coinfection with helminths that invade the liver during LCMV infection resulted in greater hepatotoxicity ( Edwards et al., 2005 15. Edwards, M.J. ∙ Buchatska, O. ∙ Ashton, M. ... Reciprocal immunomodulation in a schistosome and hepatotropic virus coinfection model J. Immunol. 2005; 175 :6275-6285 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, enteric helminth infection was beneficial to outcome when viruses infected distant sites such as the lung ( Furze et al., 2006 17. Furze, R.C. ∙ Hussell, T. ∙ Selkirk, M.E. Amelioration of influenza-induced pathology in mice by coinfection with Trichinella spiralis Infect. Immun. 2006; 74 :1924-1932 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; King et al., 2017 28. King, I.L. ∙ Mohrs, K. ∙ Meli, A.P. ... Intestinal helminth infection impacts the systemic distribution and function of the naive lymphocyte pool Mucosal Immunol. 2017; 10 :1160-1168 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). In such situations, enteric helminths and the ensuing immune responses can alter leukocyte trafficking or activation and limit pathological inflammation. These observations suggest that the tissue niche of co-infection can determine outcome.
One consequence of the loss of barrier integrity was a collapse of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in the spleen of coinfected mice. T cell priming appeared normal, as WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses were equivalent in number and activation in WNV-only and coinfected mice at day 7. However, by day 8, increased annexin V expression was observed preferentially on WNV-specific CD8 + T cells of coinfected mice, suggesting the loss of a pro-survival signal or gain of a pro-death signal after priming. This survival signal could be DC-derived, because we noted that DCs were absent in T cell zones of the spleen in coinfected mice. Because antibiotic treatment of coinfected mice rescued the CD8 + T cell defects, it appears that bacterial translocation from the GI tract and systemic spread to lymphoid tissues contributes to the decline of antiviral CD8 + T cells. In contrast, IL-4 treatment during infection with LCMV did not cause bacterial translocation and induced only minor defects in antiviral CD8 + T cell response. Consistent with our results, translocation of gut bacteria in some sepsis models preferentially affects CD8 + T cells, DCs, and natural killer (NK) cells ( Danahy et al., 2016 12. Danahy, D.B. ∙ Strother, R.K. ∙ Badovinac, V.P. ... Clinical and Experimental Sepsis Impairs CD8 T-Cell-Mediated Immunity Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 36 :57-74 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jensen et al., 2018 25. Jensen, I.J. ∙ Winborn, C.S. ∙ Fosdick, M.G. ... Polymicrobial sepsis influences NK-cell-mediated immunity by diminishing NK-cell-intrinsic receptor-mediated effector responses to viral ligands or infections PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007405 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), and intravenous administration of E. coli dampened LCMV-specific CD8 + T cell responses ( Straub et al., 2018 60. Straub, T. ∙ Freudenberg, M.A. ∙ Schleicher, U. ... Bacterial coinfection restrains antiviral CD8 T-cell response via LPS-induced inhibitory NK cells Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4117 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our findings contrast with a study that examined coinfection with another enteric helminth, Trichinella spiralis (Ts), and an enteric MNoV infection ( Osborne et al., 2014 47. Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ∙ Nice, T.J. ... Coinfection. Virus-helminth coinfection reveals a microbiota-independent mechanism of immunomodulation Science. 2014; 345 :578-582 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike the MNoV model, in which elevated viral burden was observed only in the distal SI of coinfected mice, we observed higher WNV burden in multiple GI tract segments as well as CNS tissues, which impacted clinical outcome. We did not detect proliferation defects in virus-specific CD8 + T cells as reported in the Ts/MNoV coinfection study but instead observed increased cell death. In both studies, STAT6 responses mechanistically played a role, but the specific aspects of type 2 immunity were distinct. In the Ts/MNoV coinfection study, impaired CD8 + T cell responses were attributed to IL-4 skewing of macrophages to an alternatively activated state, as has been reported in other studies ( Monin et al., 2015 40. Monin, L. ∙ Griffiths, K.L. ∙ Lam, W.Y. ... Helminth-induced arginase-1 exacerbates lung inflammation and disease severity in tuberculosis J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :4699-4713 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reese et al., 2014 50. Reese, T.A. ∙ Wakeman, B.S. ∙ Choi, H.S. ... Helminth infection reactivates latent γ-herpesvirus via cytokine competition at a viral promoter Science. 2014; 345 :573-577 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, during Hpb and WNV coinfection, a lack of IL-4Rα expression on myeloid (LysM-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl ) or other hematopoietic cells (Vav-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl ) did not affect GI tract pathology or mortality. In contrast, a lack of IL-4Rα signaling in intestinal epithelium (Villin-Cre + IL-4Rα fl/fl ) rescued the coinfected mice from severe disease. These data suggest that the IL-4 and STAT6 response acts intrinsically in intestinal epithelium after Hpb and WNV co-infection to contribute to disease pathogenesis.
Tuft cells are chemosensing intestinal epithelial cells whose role during viral infection remains poorly defined because of their relatively low frequency ( Ting and von Moltke, 2019 64. Ting, H.A. ∙ von Moltke, J. The Immune Function of Tuft Cells at Gut Mucosal Surfaces and Beyond J. Immunol. 2019; 202 :1321-1329 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, tuft cells expand after detecting enteric helminths and protists ( Ting and von Moltke, 2019 64. Ting, H.A. ∙ von Moltke, J. The Immune Function of Tuft Cells at Gut Mucosal Surfaces and Beyond J. Immunol. 2019; 202 :1321-1329 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that Pou2f3 −/− mice lacking tuft cells were resistant to coinfection-induced lethality. Tuft cell-derived signals induce GI tract remodeling in the intestinal epithelium and lamina propria, which could impact tropism, as seen for MNoV ( Wilen et al., 2018 72. Wilen, C.B. ∙ Lee, S. ∙ Hsieh, L.L. ... Tropism for tuft cells determines immune promotion of norovirus pathogenesis Science. 2018; 360 :204-208 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, tuft cell-derived signals could modulate the downstream consequences of WNV infection in neurons of the myenteric plexus ( White et al., 2018 71. White, J.P. ∙ Xiong, S. ∙ Malvin, N.P. ... Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) including alterations of neuronal networks. Although the precise signals that affect the permissiveness of enteric neurons remains unknown, cross-talk between type 2 immunity and enteric nervous system neurons was recently described ( Moriyama and Artis, 2019 41. Moriyama, S. ∙ Artis, D. Neuronal regulation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells and type 2 inflammation Adv. Immunol. 2019; 143 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, inputs from enteric neurons are important for epithelial cell regeneration and maintaining barrier integrity, and neuronal damage by WNV could disrupt this communication signal ( Vergnolle and Cirillo, 2018 68. Vergnolle, N. ∙ Cirillo, C. Neurons and Glia in the Enteric Nervous System and Epithelial Barrier Function Physiology (Bethesda). 2018; 33 :269-280 PubMed Google Scholar ). Coinfection caused greater turnover and shedding of intestinal epithelial cells resulting in villus blunting and focal tufting along the lining of the proximal SI. Our finding that IL-25 treatment in the absence of helminths exacerbated WNV infection-induced gut pathology is consistent with tuft cells providing a key initiating pathological signal. Recently, succinate was discovered as a tuft cell activation ligand, and the succinate receptor SUNCR1 was found exclusively on tuft cells among intestinal epithelial cell lineages ( Nadjsombati et al., 2018 43. Nadjsombati, M.S. ∙ McGinty, J.W. ∙ Lyons-Cohen, M.R. ... Detection of Succinate by Intestinal Tuft Cells Triggers a Type 2 Innate Immune Circuit Immunity. 2018; 49 :33-41.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, when we treated helminth-free mice with succinate and then infected them with WNV, we observed GI pathology and mortality, suggesting that lumenal succinate sensing by tuft cells adversely affected WNV disease outcome. Although we do not know if succinate is the trigger for enhanced WNV disease during coinfection, Sucnr1 −/− mice lacked gut pathology or altered WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses following WNV and Hpb coinfection. Consistent with this observation, succinate-producing commensal bacteria are enriched during helminth infection in the context of changes to the microbiome ( Lei et al., 2018 32. Lei, W. ∙ Ren, W. ∙ Ohmoto, M. ... Activation of intestinal tuft cell-expressed Sucnr1 triggers type 2 immunity in the mouse small intestine Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :5552-5557 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, succinate could be derived from helminths themselves ( Nadjsombati et al., 2018 43. Nadjsombati, M.S. ∙ McGinty, J.W. ∙ Lyons-Cohen, M.R. ... Detection of Succinate by Intestinal Tuft Cells Triggers a Type 2 Innate Immune Circuit Immunity. 2018; 49 :33-41.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The geographical overlap between WNV and enteric helminth infections principally is restricted to the African subcontinent and parts of Eastern Europe ( Hotez et al., 2008 22. Hotez, P.J. ∙ Brindley, P.J. ∙ Bethony, J.M. ... Helminth infections: the great neglected tropical diseases J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 :1311-1321 Crossref Scopus (1145) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sule et al., 2018 61. Sule, W.F. ∙ Oluwayelu, D.O. ∙ Hernández-Triana, L.M. ... Epidemiology and ecology of West Nile virus in sub-Saharan Africa Parasit. Vectors. 2018; 11 :414 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, several other mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses are endemic in areas of the world with high helminth burden including South America, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia ( Daep et al., 2014 11. Daep, C.A. ∙ Muñoz-Jordán, J.L. ∙ Eugenin, E.A. Flaviviruses, an expanding threat in public health: focus on dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis virus J. Neurovirol. 2014; 20 :539-560 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we used WNV as a model for dissecting the mechanisms for enhanced host susceptibility, similar findings were observed with other neurotropic flaviviruses that can infect the myenteric plexus of the GI tract ( White et al., 2018 71. White, J.P. ∙ Xiong, S. ∙ Malvin, N.P. ... Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies will be required to define the impact of enteric helminth infection on host immunity to neurotropic and viscerotropic flaviviruses in humans and other susceptible vertebrate animals.
During helminth or protist infections alone, overt injury to the host GI tract is not observed on activation of tuft cells, except for lengthening of the small intestine to accommodate metabolic needs ( Schneider et al., 2018 55. Schneider, C. ∙ O’Leary, C.E. ∙ von Moltke, J. ... A Metabolite-Triggered Tuft Cell-ILC2 Circuit Drives Small Intestinal Remodeling Cell. 2018; 174 :271-284.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). Only when mice were co-infected with helminths and WNV, did we observe functional damage to the GI tract. Thus, helminth-mediated GI remodeling, which likely protects against worm re-challenge, can adversely affect a heterologous virus challenge. Future studies that elucidate the mechanistic relationships between neuronal inputs, tuft cells, type 2 immunity, and barrier integrity in the context of coinfection may reveal paradigms as to how the neuroimmune axis in the GI tract contributes to protection or damage against pathogen-induced tissue injury. Moreover, epidemiological studies are needed to define the impact of other helminth infections (e.g., flukes, tapeworms, and roundworms) on the outcome of systemic and enteric viral infections that target different cells and regions of the GI tract.

This study was conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Animal experiments were performed as specified in protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Washington University School of Medicine (Assurance Number: A3381-01). All dissections and inoculations were performed under anesthesia, induced and maintained by using ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine and every effort was made to minimize suffering.
C57BL/6J WT mice (000664) were purchased directly from Jackson Laboratories. Stat6 tm1Gru ( Stat6 −/− ) (005977) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred at Washington University under specific pathogen-free conditions. Il4ra fl/fl mice on a C57BL/6J background were obtained from Dr. Ajay Chawla (University of California, San Francisco) and crossed with different Cre recombinase mice (Vav +/− Cre; B6.Cg-Commd10 Tg(Vav1-icre)A2Kio /J, Villin +/− B6. Cre; B6.Cg-Tg(Vil1-cre)997Gum/J, LysM +/− Cre; B6.129P2-Lyz2 tm1lfo /J) (Creasy et al., 2017) to generate cell-specific deletions of the IL-4Rα subunit. Cre recombinase mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories: (Vav-Cre (008610), Villin-Cre (004586), LysM-Cre (004781)) and bred at Washington University. Pou2f3 −/− mice were developed with assistance from the Genome Engineering and iPSC 556 Center (GEiC) at Washington University in Saint Louis. Small guide sgRNA 5′- AGGCCATGCCACCTGAGCCANGG-3′ was designed to target the Pou2f3 locus in the fourth exon. C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) fertilized zygotes were injected with Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. A founder mouse with the following mutation was recovered: WT CCCACAGGCCATGCCACCTGAGCCAAGGAC; KO CCCACAGGCCT———CTCCCAAGGAC. Sucnr1 −/− mice were kindly provided by Jakob von Moltke (University of Washington). Age-matched (9 or 10-week old) male mice and their littermate controls were used in all WNV and POWV experiments. ZIKV infection experiments were performed in 4-week old WT male mice. All transgenic mice were genotyped by real-time PCR (Transnetyx). All mice were fed a 2% protein diet (PicoLab 5053, Purina) and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle.
WNV strain 3000259, New York 2000 was propagated in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells as described ( Brien et al., 2013 8. Brien, J.D. ∙ Lazear, H.M. ∙ Diamond, M.S. Propagation, quantification, detection, and storage of West Nile virus Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2013; 31 15D.3.1–15D.3.18 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mouse-adapted ZIKV (strain Dakar 41525) was propagated as described ( Gorman et al., 2018 20. Gorman, M.J. ∙ Caine, E.A. ∙ Zaitsev, K. ... An Immunocompetent Mouse Model of Zika Virus Infection Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :672-685.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). POWV (strain FB5/13-#1) was produced as described ( VanBlargan et al., 2018 67. VanBlargan, L.A. ∙ Himansu, S. ∙ Foreman, B.M. ... An mRNA Vaccine Protects Mice against Multiple Tick-Transmitted Flavivirus Infections Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :3382-3392.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Virus stocks were tittered on Vero cells by focus-forming assay ( Brien et al., 2013 8. Brien, J.D. ∙ Lazear, H.M. ∙ Diamond, M.S. Propagation, quantification, detection, and storage of West Nile virus Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2013; 31 15D.3.1–15D.3.18 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stocks of LCMV (Armstrong strain) were propagated in BHK21 cells and tittered on Vero cells by focus-forming assays.
Hpb third-stage larvae (L3) were generated as described ( Camberis et al., 2003 9. Camberis, M. ∙ Le Gros, G. ∙ Urban, Jr., J. Animal model of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Heligmosomoides polygyrus Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2003; Chapter 19 :Unit 19.12 PubMed Google Scholar ). Hpb L3 viability was checked by microscope for motility, and their numbers were quantified before use. Mice were gavaged with 200 Hpb L3 or PBS (control) using 20-gauge x 38 mm plastic feeding tubes (Instech; FTP-20-38). Twelve days after inoculation with Hpb L3, mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the footpad with 10 2 FFU of WNV, 10 2 FFU of POWV, 10 6 FFU of ZIKV or 10 3 FFU of LCMV in 50 μL of PBS. Mice treated with IL-4c, IL-25 and succinate also were infected with the same doses of WNV and POWV. In some experiments, mice were gavaged with 2.5 mg/ml of the anti-helminthic drug pyrantel pamoate (Columbia Laboratories) on two consecutive days (day −2, day −1) prior to WNV infection (day 0).
Fresh fecal pellets were collected at indicated time points and eggs per gram of feces were enumerated as a readout of worm fitness ( Li et al., 2018 33. Li, S. ∙ Bostick, J.W. ∙ Ye, J. ... Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling Cell Intrinsically Inhibits Intestinal Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cell Function Immunity. 2018; 49 :915-928.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, two to three fecal pellets were collected from each mouse, weighed and homogenized in 2 mL of distilled H 2 O with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Two ml of saturated NaCl solution was added to each tube, mixed and allowed to settle for 5 to 10 min for the eggs to float on the top. Using a sterile pipette, 400 μl of the mixed solution was loaded onto McMaster 2-chamber egg counter. The worm eggs were counted within the grid and the eggs per gram feces were determined by the following formula: eggs/g = egg counts x 26.67 weight of feces (g). The 26.67 in the formula is obtained from the total volume in which the fecal pellets are suspended (4 ml) divided by the volume within the grid (0.15 ml).
At specific days after virus inoculation, anesthetized mice were perfused with 20 mL of sterile PBS. Subsequently, tissues were harvested in sterile 2 mL tubes and stored at −80°C. Frozen tissues were thawed, weighed and homogenized in 0.3 to 0.5 mL of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS containing ceramic beads using a MagNA Lyser tissue homogenizer (Roche). RNA was extracted from 50 μL of homogenate using an Applied Biosystems 5x MagMax RNA viral isolation kit (Thermo Scientific) and a Kingfisher duo prime extraction machine (Thermo Scientific). All viral RNA quantifications were performed using one-step qRT-PCR on a 7500 Fast Real Time-PCR system (Applied Biosystems). WNV genome copies were quantified using WNV-specific primers and probes and compared to a standard curve of purified viral genomic RNA ( Brien et al., 2013 8. Brien, J.D. ∙ Lazear, H.M. ∙ Diamond, M.S. Propagation, quantification, detection, and storage of West Nile virus Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2013; 31 15D.3.1–15D.3.18 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genome copies were normalized by tissue weight and expressed as log 10 genome copies of RNA or FFU equivalents per gram of tissue using a standard curve.
GI tract motility was measured using a carmine red dye assay ( White et al., 2018 71. White, J.P. ∙ Xiong, S. ∙ Malvin, N.P. ... Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 6% (w/v) carmine red dye (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile distilled water containing 0.5% methyl cellulose (Sigma Aldrich). Mice were gavaged with 300 μL of carmine dye solution, and 3 h later placed individually in empty cages to check for emergence of red fecal pellets over 6 h.
Intestinal sections were harvested at indicated times after inoculation, opened along the mesenteric border, pinned to Sylgard silicon plates, and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at 4°C. Following dehydration in sequential ethanol (30%, 50% and 70%) washes, the tissues were blocked in 2% agar and stored in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Subsequently, paraffin embedding, sectioning, and staining with hematoxylin and eosin was performed (Developmental Biology Core Facility, Washington University School of Medicine).
For WNV antigen staining in intestinal sections, tissues were deparaffinized by three sequential incubations in xylene followed by three sequential washes in isopropanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling sections in Dako Target Retrieval Solution (Dako) or Trilogy antigen retrieval solution (Cell Marque) for 20 min followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature. Slides were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in Tris-HCl (25 mM, pH 7.4) or PBS buffered solutions containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5% normal donkey serum, and 0.05% Tween-20. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with rat anti-WNV hyperimmune serum (1:400) ( Diamond et al., 2003 13. Diamond, M.S. ∙ Shrestha, B. ∙ Marri, A. ... B cells and antibody play critical roles in the immediate defense of disseminated infection by West Nile encephalitis virus J. Virol. 2003; 77 :2578-2586 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ), rabbit anti-Tuj1 polyclonal serum (1:500, Sigma Aldrich, catalog # T2200). Primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat (Jackson Laboratories) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (ThermoFisher) diluted in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature. Following counter staining with Hoechst 33342 dye (Thermo Fisher), tissue sections were mounted in ProLong Gold anti-fade (Thermo Fisher) and stored at 4°C until imaging. For the cell death assay, antigen retrieval and permeabilization was performed as described above prior to TUNEL staining using In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche, # 12156792910) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For whole mount staining, pinned tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at 4°C. Following three washes in PBS, the muscularis propria was dissected from the mucosa under a dissecting microscope and stored at 4°C in PBS and 0.02% NaN 3 . Tissues were blocked for 1 h at room temperature (Blocking buffer: TBS (WNV antigen staining) or PBS (nNOS and calretinin staining) + 5% donkey serum + 1% BSA + 1% Triton X-100) and incubated overnight with primary antibodies (nNOS (Abcam; Ab1376), calretinin clone DC8 (Thermofisher, 180211), Iba1 (Abcam; Ab178846), anti-WNV polyclonal serum) ( Diamond et al., 2003 13. Diamond, M.S. ∙ Shrestha, B. ∙ Marri, A. ... B cells and antibody play critical roles in the immediate defense of disseminated infection by West Nile encephalitis virus J. Virol. 2003; 77 :2578-2586 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 4°C. Following three washes in PBS + 1% Triton X-100, the tissues were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 647 (Thermofisher, A31573 and A21206), donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermofisher, A11055) and donkey anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermofisher, 21209) in PBS or TBS + 3% donkey serum + 1% BSA +1% Triton X-100. Subsequently, tissue sections were washed three times in PBS + 1% Triton X-100, counterstained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 dye (Thermo Fisher) and mounted in Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences). Sections were imaged with Zeiss LSM880 Laser Scanning Confocal microscope using 20x (NA 0.8) or 40x (NA 1.4) objectives. The scanned images were processed and analyzed by Fiji software ( https://fiji.sc/Fiji ). For quantification of neuronal density, five random regions (0.65 mm 2 ) of 20x magnification area were scanned and stitched (ZEN black software, Zeiss). To determine the level of WNV infection, regions of tissue of 4 mm 2 size were scanned and stitched (ZEN black software, Zeiss). For all images, the background signal was uniformly subtracted (rolling ball, radius 50). Quantification was performed by converting images to binary using a threshold tool, and a fraction of total area was measured. For calretinin and nNOS positive areas, the median value from each 5 images was calculated for every mouse and normalized to values in naive mice. The amount of WNV infection (% of total area with WNV-antigen staining) in coinfected mice was expressed as the fold change of values of sections obtained from WNV-only infected mice. Sections from naive mice served as negative controls.
Gut bacterial leakage was determined as described ( Liu et al., 2019 35. Liu, Q. ∙ Johnson, E.M. ∙ Lam, R.K. ... Peripheral TREM1 responses to brain and intestinal immunogens amplify stroke severity Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :1023-1034 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, spleens of naive or infected mice were harvested at specified time points in a 15 mL conical containing 2 mL of sterile DMEM without antibiotics or FBS. Spleens were minced into small pieces with a sterile scissors to avoid contamination. Sterile DMEM (3 ml, no antibiotics or FBS) was added to samples, and two sequential dilutions (1:10 and 1:100) were made by taking 1 mL from the 5 mL sample using same sterile DMEM. Samples were plated on blood agar plates (Fisher Scientific; 221239) using an L-shaped spreader. Plates were incubated with at 37°C overnight and on the next day, the number of colonies were counted. Approximately 300 to 400 μL of blood was aspirated from the thoracic cavity of each mouse using sterile 1 mL syringe and transferred to blood collection tube containing EDTA (Becton Dickinson; 365971). After two sequential dilution in sterile DMEM (no antibiotics, no FBS), 100 μL of blood was plated on blood agar plates, incubated overnight at 37°C and colonies were quantified on the next day.
A FITC-dextran assay was used to measure intestinal permeability ( Stanley et al., 2016 59. Stanley, D. ∙ Mason, L.J. ∙ Mackin, K.E. ... Translocation and dissemination of commensal bacteria in post-stroke infection Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :1277-1284 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were gavaged with 150 μL of FITC-dextran (3-5 kDa; Sigma) at 80 mg/ml in sterile PBS. Mice were euthanized 4-h later, and blood was collected into serum separator tubes. Tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 x rpm for 10 min, serum was transferred to new sterile tubes and diluted 1:1 with 2% Triton X-100. Serum fluorescence intensities were measured at 485 nm excitation/528 nm emission using a Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Inc.).
Tissues (spleen, brain and lymph nodes) were harvested at specified times after virus inoculation. All mice were anesthetized and perfused with 20 mL of sterile PBS, and tissues were collected in 2 mL tubes containing 1 mL of fresh DMEM. Spleen and lymph nodes were dispersed into single cell suspension using a 70 μm cell strainer. Erythrocytes were lysed using ACK lysis buffer, and cells were resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS. An aliquot was taken for cell counting and ~2-4 × 10 6 cells were plated in 96-well round-bottom plates and incubated with antibodies against different antigens. Brain samples were minced in small pieces and incubated for 45 min with digestion buffer containing 0.05% collagenase D, 10 μg/ml of DNase in HBSS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4; Life Technologies). The brain digest was pushed through a 70 μm cell strainer, washed and resuspended in 10 mL of 30% Percoll solution and centrifuged for 30 min (1,200 x rpm at 4°C, no brake). The top myelin layer was removed using a transfer pipette, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of FACS buffer (2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% NaN 3 ) and stained with antibodies.
For staining of surface antigens (spleen, brain and MLN), cell suspensions were stained with fluorophore conjugated antibody cocktail containing Viability Dye (eBiosciences; 506), Fc block (BD Biosciences; clone 2.4G2), CD45 (BD Biosciences; clone 30-F11), B220 (BioLegend; clone RA36B4), CD3 (BD Biosciences; clone 145-2c11), CD8α (BioLegend; clone 53-6.7), CD4 (BioLegend; clone RM4-5), CD44 (BioLegend; clone IM7), KLRG1 (eBiosciences; clone 2F1), CD127 (eBiosciences; clone A7R34) and WNV specific D b -immunodominant NS4B tetramer (NIH Tetramer Core Facility; SSVWNATTA) in FACS buffer for 45 min at 4°C. Subsequently, cells were washed with FACS buffer, fixed using 4% PFA for 5 min at room temperature, and washed again with FACS buffer. Cells were resuspended in 200 μL of FACS buffer and analyzed on a BD X-20 flow cytometry machine within 3 days. For staining of intracellular antigens in T cells, cells were washed with FACS buffer, fixed and permeabilized using Foxp3 staining kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (eBiosciences; 00552300), and then stained with anti-T-bet (Invitrogen; clone 4B10), anti-Ki67 (eBiosciences; clone SolA15), anti-Foxp3 (BD Biosciences; clone MF23) or anti-GATA3 (BD Biosciences; clone L50-823) antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. For Annexin V staining, cells were stained according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BioLegend; 640905), kept in Annexin V binding buffer with 2% PFA, and processed on a BD x-20 Flow cytometer on the same day. For myeloid cell staining, cells were stained with Viability Dye (eBiosciences; 506), Fc block (BD Biosciences; clone 2.4G2), CD45 (BD Biosciences; clone 30-F11), CD3 (BD Biosciences; clone 145-2c11) [negative cells], B220 (BioLegend; clone RA36B4) [negative cells], CD11b (BD Biosciences; clone M1/70), NK1.1 (BioLegend; clone PK136), Ly6G (BioLegend; clone 1A8), Ly6C (eBiosciences; clone HK1.4), Siglec F (BD Biosciences; clone E50-2440), CD11c (BD Biosciences; clone HL3), MHC-II (BioLegend; clone M1308A10) and F4/80 (eBiosciences; clone BM8). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Inc.).
Spleens were fixed in 2 mL of periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) fixative (PBS containing 0.1 M L-lysine, 2% PFA, and 2.1 mg/ml NaIO 4 at pH 7.4) for 24 hours at 4°C and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose/PBS solution. Spleens then were embedded in OCT medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and frozen in dry-ice cooled isopentane. Sixteen-micron sections were cut on a Leica cryostat (Leica Microsystems), blocked with 5% goat or donkey serum then stained with antibodies against one or more of the following proteins or structures: CD11c (clone N418, eBioscience), CD8α (clone 53-6.7, eBioscience), B220 (clone RA3–6B2, eBioscience), CD169 (3D6.112, Biolegend), GL7 (clone GL7, Biolegend), CD21/35 (clone eBio4E3, eBioscience), MAdCAM-1 (clone MECA-367, eBioscience), ERTR7 (which recognizes an fibroblastic reticular cells antigen was used to identify the LN stromal network including conduits, blood vessels, and lymphatic sinuses; rat monoclonal, Abcam, 51824). Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies only as controls, and images were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope, identical PMT (photomultiplier tube) and laser settings. Images were analyzed by using Imaris software (Bitplane).
IL-4c were generated as described ( Jenkins et al., 2011 24. Jenkins, S.J. ∙ Ruckerl, D. ∙ Cook, P.C. ... Local macrophage proliferation, rather than recruitment from the blood, is a signature of TH2 inflammation Science. 2011; 332 :1284-1288 Crossref Scopus (1099) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each mouse, 5 μg of murine IL-4 (Peprotech) was mixed with 25 μg anti-IL-4 (BioXCell, Clone 11B11) and incubated for 15 min on ice before diluting in 200 μL total volume of PBS. IL-4c was administered via an intraperitoneal route (200 μl/mouse) on two consecutive days (day −2 and −1) relative to virus infection (day 0). In some experiments, mice were administered 500 ng/mouse of recombinant IL-25 (R&D 1399-IL-025/CF) in 100 μL of PBS via intraperitoneal route on two consecutive days (days −2 and −1) relative to virus infection.
Mice were provided with sodium succinate hexahydrate (Alfa Aesar) ad libitum in drinking water at a concentration 150 mM starting 7 days prior to WNV inoculation and continued throughout the experiment as described ( Nadjsombati et al., 2018 43. Nadjsombati, M.S. ∙ McGinty, J.W. ∙ Lyons-Cohen, M.R. ... Detection of Succinate by Intestinal Tuft Cells Triggers a Type 2 Innate Immune Circuit Immunity. 2018; 49 :33-41.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mice were administered 500 μg of meropenem (Sigma; PHR1772) twice daily (12 hours apart) via intraperitoneal route starting from day 5 post-WNV infection until day 9. In separate experiments, mice were administered an oral antibiotic cocktail of vancomycin, neomycin, and ampicillin (0.5 g each per liter) in water starting from day 5 post-WNV infection until day 9 ( Thackray et al., 2018 63. Thackray, L.B. ∙ Handley, S.A. ∙ Gorman, M.J. ... Oral Antibiotic Treatment of Mice Exacerbates the Disease Severity of Multiple Flavivirus Infections Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :3440-3453.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ).
IL-4 and IL-25 cytokine levels were quantified from MLN or small intestinal homogenates by ELISA as per manufacturer’s instructions (R & D Systems, M4000B; Thermofisher Scientific, BMS6046).
Statistical tests used to analyze experiments are described in the Figure Legends. Survival curves were analyzed by log-rank test with Bonferroni corrections, weight loss was measured by one-way ordinary ANOVA with Holm-Sidak test. WNV antigen in muscularis and area positive for nNOS and calretinin was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. TUNEL staining data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak test. Carmine red dye assay, gut bacterial burden, and FITC-dextran assay were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s post-test. Analysis of immune cell populations was performed using an unpaired t test. All data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad10, San Diego, CA). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size prior to experiments. The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded for clinical outcome assessment. Quantitation of immunofluorescence microscopy was performed by a blinded investigator.
