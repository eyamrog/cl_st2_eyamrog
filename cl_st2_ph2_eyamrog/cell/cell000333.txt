Title: Toward a fine-scale population health monitoring system


Abstract: Summary

Understanding population health disparities is an essential component of equitable precision health efforts. Epidemiology research often relies on definitions of race and ethnicity, but these population labels may not adequately capture disease burdens and environmental factors impacting specific sub-populations. Here, we propose a framework for repurposing data from electronic health records (EHRs) in concert with genomic data to explore the demographic ties that can impact disease burdens. Using data from a diverse biobank in New York City, we identified 17 communities sharing recent genetic ancestry. We observed 1,177 health outcomes that were statistically associated with a specific group and demonstrated significant differences in the segregation of genetic variants contributing to Mendelian diseases. We also demonstrated that fine-scale population structure can impact the prediction of complex disease risk within groups. This work reinforces the utility of linking genomic data to EHRs and provides a framework toward fine-scale monitoring of population health.

Section: Introduction

Populations around the world often have differential rates of disease due to a combination of genetic variation and environmental factors. Understanding the differences in disease burdens according to demographic factors is the basis of epidemiological research and is fundamentally important to clinical care and public health. Most studies of human disease begin by sampling from predefined populations, which are usually identified on the basis of race, ethnicity, cultural identity, or geography. However, these population categories are often too coarse to capture all of the environmental and demographic ties that can impact disease burdens. In the United States, individuals with roots from Latin America are often broadly classified as Hispanic and/or Latinx, but sub-groups with origins from different countries in the Americas may have different rates of disease. For example, populations of Puerto Rican (PR) descent have one of the highest asthma rates in the world, while populations of Mexican descent have one of the lowest ( Carter-Pokras and Gergen, 1993 23. Carter-Pokras, O.D. ∙ Gergen, P.J. Reported asthma among Puerto Rican, Mexican-American, and Cuban children, 1982 through 1984 Am. J.

With the advent of large-scale population-based DNA biobanks in health systems, new opportunities are available to characterize the links between demography and a broad range of health outcomes ( Collins, 2012 26.

Knowledge about genetic variation shared across human populations can aid in understanding the demographic events that might impact disease burden across populations. For example, variants in the APOL1 gene, which confer a substantially increased risk of kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, arose in Africa; were first discovered in African American (AA) populations ( Kao et al., 2008 43.

However, APOL1 risk variants exist at appreciable frequencies among many populations across the Americas that historically share African genetic ancestry, but may not self-identify as African or AA, and are subsequently underrepresented in APOL1 research ( Nadkarni et al., 2018 63. Nadkarni, G.N. ∙ Gignoux, C.R. ∙ Sorokin, E.P. ... Worldwide Frequencies of APOL1 Renal Risk Variants N. Engl. J.

This suggests that while self-reported race/ethnicity (R/E) information can be useful in assessing epidemiological risk, in some cases it may be limiting. Furthermore, this information may be inaccurately captured or missing in health systems and may not accurately recapitulate the inherent population structure actually impacting disease risk ( Smith et al., 2010 82.

High-density genome-scale data have long been used to examine genetic differences between populations that, in turn, can be used to infer population genetic history. Popular techniques are algorithmic-based methods such as principal-component analysis (PCA) ( Price et al., 2006 74. Price, A.L. ∙ Patterson, N.J. ∙ Plenge, R.M. ...

Population structure and eigenanalysis PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e190 Crossref Scopus (3429) PubMed Google Scholar ) and model-based methods such as ADMIXTURE ( Pritchard et al., 2000 75.

Other powerful approaches infer more fine-scale genetic ancestry by using local haplotypes along chromosomal segments ( Gusev et al., 2009 35. Gusev, A. ∙ Lowe, J.K. ∙ Stoffel, M. ...

Genet. 2013; 93 :278-288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). One such approach identifies residual signatures of distant genetic relationships that may be detected by inferring long-range haplotypes ( Browning and Browning, 2012 16. Browning, S.R. ∙ Browning, B.L. Identity by descent between distant relatives: detection and applications Annu. Rev. Genet. 2012; 46 :617-633 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although genetic traces of our distant ancestors will decay rapidly over time, long haplotypes that have been co-inherited identical by descent (IBD) from some of our more recent ancestors may persist. At a population level, these can be analyzed in aggregate to infer distant relationships to a set of shared ancestors. We expect that individuals in a population who are distantly related to one another may also be more likely to share recent population history. This, in turn, may be linked to sharing of culture, environment, and correlations in disease risk.
In this study, we examined fine-scale population structure in Bio Me , a highly diverse multi-ethnic biobank ascertained through the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City (NYC). When comparing EHR-recorded and self-reported R/E, we observed varying rates of discordance, demonstrating that R/E information can be inconsistently captured in EHRs, particularly for Hispanic/Latinx and Asian populations. Exploring genetic ancestry within Bio Me revealed further complexity, with distinct patterns of continental and subcontinental genetic substructure within self-reported R/E groups. To investigate this substructure further, we analyzed IBD sharing in Bio Me and applied an unsupervised, scale-free network modeling method to uncover clusters of populations informed by patterns of recent demography. We revealed 17 distinct communities highly correlated with recent migratory patterns to NYC and demonstrated that some of these communities harbor signatures of founder events, the timings of which coincided with the era of colonization of the Americas. We linked these communities to more than 1,700 health outcomes and found distinctive health patterns of disease risk, uncovering more than 1,100 examples of statistically significant differences in health outcomes between populations, some of which point to unknown or underappreciated population-specific disease risks. We then demonstrate elevated prevalence of founder variants for genetic disorders in two IBD founder communities relative to self-reporting R/E labels and country-of-origin information, suggesting that IBD communities allow for refined inference of prevalence of pathogenic variants in at-risk populations. Finally, we demonstrate significant differences in the distributions and predictive power of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) between two European ancestry IBD communities, indicating that fine-scale population structure also impacts our understanding of the genetics of complex traits. This work demonstrates the value of the application of genetic ancestry in medicine and how understanding fine-scale population structure could improve population health monitoring.

Section: Results

We evaluated R/E in a large (N = 36,061), diverse biobank (Bio Me ) linked to EHRs in the Mount Sinai Health System in NYC. To understand how R/E information is captured in a large, urban health system, we compared the self-reported R/E surveyed during the Bio Me enrollment (self-reported R/E; Table S1 ) to R/E recorded in the Mount Sinai EHRs. We first restricted analysis to participants who reported only one of the following R/Es in the enrollment survey for one of five population groups: European American (EA; N = 9,830; see Star Methods ), AA (N = 7,976), Hispanic/Latino (HL; N = 11,544), East and Southeast Asian (ESA; N = 965), and Native American (NA; N = 61) (total: 84.2% of Bio Me ; N = 30,376 participants and n = 1,310,279 total visits). We mapped self-reported R/E for these individuals to R/E information extracted from the EHR at each independent visit. Self-reported and EHR-recorded R/E was concordant in 64.5% of total visits, or 71.6% of visits if excluding visits where R/E was designated as “unknown” (resulting in the exclusion of n = 129,678 healthcare visits), and we observed significant differences in concordance between population groups ( Figure 1 A). The remaining 15.8% of Bio Me participants self-reported a different R/E that did not directly correspond to an EHR-recorded R/E variable, precluding us from making a direct comparison between the two ( Figure S1 A). Overall, these analyses support that R/E data are often poorly and inconsistently captured, particularly for non-EA populations, during hospital visits ( Banda et al., 2015 12. Banda, Y. ∙ Kvale, M.N. ∙ Hoffmann, T.J. ...

Med. 2015; 30 :719-723 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To explore the relationship between self-reported R/E and genetic ancestry, we estimated global genetic ancestry proportions for a subset of Bio Me participants (N = 31,705) genotyped on the Global Screening Array (GSA). We first examined the correlation between self-reported R/E and self-reported region of origin, revealing a complex relationship between R/E and subcontinental region ( Figure 1 B). We then merged Bio Me participants with a reference panel of 87 populations representing ancestry from seven continental or subcontinental regions. Using PCA, we demonstrate that Bio Me participants represent a continuum of genetic diversity, even within self-reported R/E groups ( Figure 1 C). Bio Me participants fall between African and non-African reference panels on principal component 1 (PC 1) and between European, Asian, American, and Oceanian reference panels on PC 2 ( Figure 1 D). The first 10 PCs can also be represented as a low-dimensional topological map using the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm, presenting many clusters that are roughly grouped by continent and others with little or no overlap with reference panels, presenting a challenge for their interpretation ( Figure S1 B).
We also explored population demography using ADMIXTURE, a model-based approach that applies a pre-set number of putative ancestral populations to seek the best fit of ancestral clusters in the data ( Figure S1 C). Analysis, including reference panels from Thousand Genomes Project (TGP; N = 2,504), the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP; N = 986), and the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study (N = 700), that was fit to five ancestral populations ( k = 5) recapitulates five continental-level ancestral components corresponding to African, European, East Asian, South Asian, and Amerindigenous ancestry. As expected, self-reported AA and HL participants exhibited varying degrees of ancestry from Europe, Africa, and the Americas; however, several individuals also appear to have appreciable (>10%) levels of South Asian (2.2% of individuals) or East Asian (0.6% of individuals) ancestry ( Figure 1 E). Participants who self-identify as “other” exhibit varying proportions of admixture from all 5 different continent groups. At k = 12, we observe an appreciable Oceanian component (6.3%; Figure 1 F, orange) in participants who self-identify as East Asian, two distinct Amerindigenous components ( Figure 1 F, light and dark green) present in both self-reported NA and HL participants. By linking Bio Me participants born to self-reported country of birth, we were able to explore diversity linked to more recent demography ( Figure 1 G). We demonstrate European, African, and Amerindigenous ancestry proportions consistent with previous reports in participants born in Puerto Rico (59.3, 26.0, and 14.2%, respectively), Dominican Republic (50.3, 40.9, and 7.4%), Jamaica (13.0, 83.2, and 0.6%), and Cuba (66.4, 26.8, and 4.6%) ( Moreno-Estrada et al., 2013 62. Moreno-Estrada, A. ∙ Gravel, S. ∙ Zakharia, F. ... Reconstructing the population genetic history of the Caribbean PLoS Genet. 2013; 9 :e1003925 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observe appreciable levels of East and South Asian ancestry in participants born in Trinidad and Tobago (4.7 and 24.5%), the Bahamas (10.3 and 7.7%), and Guyana (6.1 and 50.6%), which is consistent with historical accounts of South Asian migration to the Caribbean. At k = 12 ( Figure 1 H). We also observe complex structure in the European component including the resolution of a component most predominant in participants who self-report as Jewish (83.9 versus 4.3% in participants who self-reported as “white/Caucasian” only) in a subset of the US-born participants, as well as participants born in North African and the Middle East. Furthermore, we observe two distinct European components that likely represent a northern-southern European cline in genetic ancestry across Europe ( Novembre et al., 2008 66. Novembre, J. ∙ Johnson, T. ∙ Bryc, K. ... Genes mirror geography within Europe Nature. 2008; 456 :98-101 Crossref Scopus (1004) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a distinct European component that appears predominantly in admixed populations from the Americas. This component is particularly notable in Caribbean-born participants and is present to a lesser extent in Portuguese- and Spanish-born Bio Me participants. Taken together, this information reveals Bio Me to be a rich source of ancestral genetic diversity, including many populations that are otherwise poorly represented in biomedical genomics research.
To further investigate the complex genetic ancestry in Bio Me , we explored patterns of distant relatedness reflecting fine-scale structure. We first detected pairwise genomic tracts inherited IBD (pairwise haplotypic tracts of 3 cM or longer) between all participants and 2,504 participants comprising 26 global populations of the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 ( Abecasis et al., 2012 1. 1000 Genomes Project Consortium ∙ Abecasis, G.R. ∙ Auton, A. ... An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes Nature. 2012; 491 :56-65 Crossref Scopus (5965) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used this information to construct a network of pairwise IBD sharing between all individuals who were not inferred to be directly related (see STAR Methods ; Figure S2 A). To identify “communities” of individuals enriched for recent, shared genetic ancestry, we performed community detection via flow-based clustering using the InfoMap algorithm ( Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008 78. Rosvall, M. ∙ Bergstrom, C.T. Maps of random walks on complex networks reveal community structure Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :1118-1123 Crossref Scopus (3235) PubMed Google Scholar , 2011 79. Rosvall, M. ∙ Bergstrom, C.T. Multilevel compression of random walks on networks reveals hierarchical organization in large integrated systems PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e18209 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
We observed that 96% of Bio Me participants fall into one of 17 distinct clusters containing at least 100 individuals that we refer to as IBD communities. Analysis of the inter- and intra-population-level sharing of these communities revealed a higher probability of pairwise IBD sharing within communities compared with between communities ( Figure 2 C). Additionally, in instances where IBD sharing does occur, the pairwise sum of IBD sharing is also higher within than between communities ( Figure S2 B). We examined the topology of the IBD network and determined community assignments to be non-random through a node-level comparison of similar edges between 10 instances of a network based on pairwise IBD sharing and 100 instances of topologically similar random networks created with the Erdős-Rényi (ER) model ( Durrett, 2006 33. Durrett, R. Erdös–Rényi Random Graphs Random Graph Dynamics Cambridge University Press, 2006; 27-69 Crossref Google Scholar ). The quantile of the Jaccard similarity coefficient obtained by comparing these networks corresponds to a permutation p value. Therefore, the communities detected by using the InfoMap algorithm are non-random and statistically significant (p < 3.25 × 10 −4 ).
We hypothesized that these communities represent geographical or ethnic substructure within the Bio Me population. To test this, we compared IBD community membership to survey-derived population level information for Bio Me participants and calculated the positive predictive values (PPVs) for each population label (“ground truth”) versus each identified community (predictor) ( Figures S2 C and S2D). Many communities had high PPVs (>0.9) with a single country of origin (6/17), including Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Ethiopia, likely reflecting recent migrations to NYC. However, a number did not, including one community that notably consisted of 85% of individuals in Bio Me who self-reported having Jewish ancestry in the survey ( Figure S2 E). Other IBD communities were also detected that transcended self-reported R/E labels and mapped across various different groups. For example, one community that, based on a combination of self-reported country-of-origin information and PCA analysis, is likely to represent Garifuna (a population of admixed African and Amerindigenous ancestry with recent ties to Central America and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). Individuals in this community (N = 113) were either born in Europe, Central America, or in the United States and self-identified as AA, HL, or other, but cluster together tightly in PC space ( Figure S2 F).
We next determined whether IBD community detection was better able to classify individuals based on recent genetic ancestry than current best practices, i.e., k -means clustering over PCA eigenvectors. We performed k -means clustering from k = 5 to k = 20 over the first 5 PCs calculated across all Bio Me participants. To measure accuracy, we calculated PPV, negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity for each inferred cluster using country-of-origin labels. We compared k -means clustering to IBD communities with a PPV > 0.9 for country-of-origin population labels: the PR, Dominican, Ecuadorian, Colombian, Mexican, and Ethiopian communities. For each of the six communities, we observed that PPV, NPV, and specificity were always the same or higher in IBD communities compared with k -means clustering with any value of k ( Figure S3 ). We noted that while sensitivity can also be higher for IBD communities, in some cases it was lower than k -means clustering at low k values for Colombian, Mexican, and Ethiopian groups. We speculate that this may reflect population substructure within a country of origin or subsequent patterns of migration to NYC. Nevertheless, the IBD-based approach was the most accurate genetic ancestry method for detecting fine-scale population structure and was selected for the downstream analysis of genetic ancestry in medicine using health record data.
Patterns in the distribution and abundance of population-level IBD sharing are influenced by demographic events such as migration, founder effects, and population bottlenecking ( Browning and Browning, 2012 16. Browning, S.R. ∙ Browning, B.L. Identity by descent between distant relatives: detection and applications Annu. Rev. Genet. 2012; 46 :617-633 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thompson, 2013 89. Thompson, E.A. Identity by descent: variation in meiosis, across genomes, and in populations Genetics. 2013; 194 :301-326 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed evidence of founder effects in the form of elevated IBD sharing in multiple IBD communities ( Figure 3 A). These included the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) community (sample size N = 4,415; median pairwise sum of IBD sharing = 21.79 cM [95% confidence interval (CI) = 21.77–21.80], sum of runs of homozygosity [ROH] = 11.62 MB [95% CI = 11.08–12.02]) and the Finnish community (N = 120, IBD = 10.61 cM [95% CI = 10.34–10.91], ROH = 9.04 MB [95% CI = 7.32–12.74]), both of which are known and well-studied founder populations. Five other communities exhibited high levels of IBD sharing (IBD > 8 cM) and enrichment for autozygosity (ROH > 5 MB), namely PR (N = 5,452), Dominican (N = 1,971), Garifuna (N = 113), Colombian (N = 234), and Ecuadorian (N = 438) communities. By contrast, communities similar to well-studied, non-founder populations such as non-Jewish EA exhibited lower levels of IBD sharing (IBD < 5 cM) and autozygosity (ROH < 5 MB; Table S2 ). Examining the network topology, IBD communities corresponding to founder populations exhibit specific characteristics: they have a high clustering coefficient (e.g., C = 0.92 for AJ; C = 0.97 for Garifuna; C = 0.85 for PR), while non-founder populations have much lower values (e.g., C = 0.05 for AA; C = 0.09 for non-Jewish EA), and they exhibit a strongly bimodal degree distribution, with a high distance between the intra-community degree distribution and the inter-community distribution as summarized by the Wasserstein metric (e.g., W = 0.82 for AJ; W = 0.96 for Garifuna; W = 0.78 for PR), while non-founder populations have much lower values (e.g., W = 0.03 for AA; W = 0.03 for non-Jewish Europeans) ( Figure 3 B; Figure S4 A; Table S3 ).
To understand the timing of the bottlenecks leading to the observed founder effects, we used the IBD Ne software ( Browning and Browning, 2015 17. Browning, S.R. ∙ Browning, B.L. Accurate Non-parametric Estimation of Recent Effective Population Size from Segments of Identity by Descent Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2015; 97 :404-418 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ) to model each community’s effective population size (N e ) over antecedent generations. For the communities representing populations from the Americas, the results are consistent with a population bottleneck occurring approximately 10–15 generations ago, which is coincident with historical accounts of the timings of European contact and subsequent colonization ( Figure 3 C; Figure S4 B). The most profound bottleneck was observed in the Garifuna community, with a minimum N e of 321 individuals (95% CI = 286–372, 10 generations ago), consistent with a previous report ( Mathias et al., 2016 57. Mathias, R.A. ∙ Taub, M.A. ∙ Gignoux, C.R. ... A continuum of admixture in the Western Hemisphere revealed by the African Diaspora genome Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12522 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). This analysis demonstrates that founder effects are potentially more ubiquitous than previously thought, with >25% of Bio Me participants falling within a community exhibiting founder effects, and this was particularly notable among HL populations. This indicates an under-recognized potential for reducing the genetically driven health burden within HL communities, echoing similar work in South Asian populations ( Nakatsuka et al., 2017 64. Nakatsuka, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Rai, N. ... The promise of discovering population-specific disease-associated genes in South Asia Nat.

To explore the effect of IBD community membership on predisposition to EHR-captured health outcomes, we tested each community for its relative enrichment of health-related traits. First, we extracted International Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD-9) (2007–2015) and ICD-10 (2015–present) billing codes from the EHR. We then applied an aggregation schema to convert ICD codes into 1,764 distinct diseases and traits called phecodes ( Wu et al., 2019 96. Wu, P. ∙ Gifford, A. ∙ Meng, X. ... Developing and Evaluating Mappings of ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM Codes to PheCodes JMIR Med. Inform. 2019; 7 :e14325 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). We systematically performed logistic regression across all phecodes, where the membership of a given community was used as the primary predictor variable, adjusting for age and sex as covariates, and restricting analyses to communities containing ≥500 Bio Me participants (N = 7) in total. In all, 1,177 of 4,988 phecode associations tested were either significantly enriched or depleted across all seven of the top communities after Bonferroni correction. Summary statistics for phecode associations per each of the largest seven communities are reported in Table S4 .
We observed patterns of phecode enrichment across communities of shared continental ancestry. For example, three associations were significantly enriched in all three communities with appreciable African genetic ancestry (>20%), namely the PR, Dominican, and African diaspora communities ( Table S4 ): essential hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Higher prevalence of these diseases within AA populations have been widely reported in the epidemiological literature, but our findings and emerging evidence support these diseases as also being prevalent in some HL communities ( Allison et al., 2015 6. Allison, M.A. ∙ Gonzalez, 2nd, F. ∙ Raij, L. ... Cuban Americans have the highest rates of peripheral arterial disease in diverse Hispanic/Latino communities J. Vasc.

Of the significantly associated phecodes, 21.7% (n = 274) were uniquely enriched in a single community, many of which had been previously reported to be at increased prevalence within those communities. For example, the phecode for asthma was observed to be most highly enriched in the PR ancestry ( Oh et al., 2016 69. Oh, S.S. ∙ White, M.J. ∙ Gignoux, C.R. ...

Furthermore, we observe elevated levels of ulcerative colitis ( Bernstein et al., 2006 14. Bernstein, C.N. ∙ Rawsthorne, P. ∙ Cheang, M. ... A population-based case control study of potential risk factors for IBD Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2006; 101 :993-1002 Crossref Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar ) (OR = 2.61 [95% CI = 1.99–3.42); p < 2.90 × 10 −12 ) and Parkinson’s disease (OR = 2.31 [95% CI = 1.78–3.00]; p < 4.31 × 10 −10 ) in the AJ community ( Figure 4 A). We observe significantly elevated rates of sickle cell anemia ( Makani et al., 2007 51. Makani, J. ∙ Williams, T.N. ∙ Marsh, K. Sickle cell disease in Africa: burden and research priorities Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 2007; 101 :3-14 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ) (OR = 6.92 [95% CI = 4.86–9.86]; p < 8.20 × 10 −27 ) in the African diaspora community. Within the non-Jewish EA ( Table S4 ) community, we observe elevated levels of multiple sclerosis (OR = 2.55 [95% CI = 2.01–3.237]; p < 1.33 × 10 −14 ) and basal cell carcinoma (OR = 3.24 [95% CI = 2.50–4.20]; p < 7.85 × 10 −19 ). Finally, in the Filipino community, both viral hepatitis B ( Wong et al., 2013 95. Wong, S.N. ∙ Ong, J.P. ∙ Labio, M.E. ... Hepatitis B infection among adults in the philippines: A national seroprevalence study World J. Hepatol. 2013; 5 :214-219 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) (OR = 6.60 [95% CI = 5.01–8.69]; p < 3.9 × 10 −41 ) and gout ( Prasad and Krishnan, 2014 73. Prasad, P. ∙ Krishnan, E. Filipino gout: a review Arthritis Care Res. (Hoboken). 2014; 66 :337-343 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) (OR = 2.94 [95% CI = 1.99–4.35]; p < 6.55 × 10 −8 ) were at significantly higher prevalence ( Table S4 ).
Among the community-specific phecodes, we also observe an enrichment of phecodes, suggesting increased prevalence of diseases within communities, that had not been previously reported. We observed a cluster of significantly enriched circulatory system (CS)-related phecodes, where 82% (9/11) were significantly enriched in the Dominican community. For example atherosclerosis of native arteries of the extremities (OR = 4.06 [95% CI = 3.13–5.28]; p < 9.83 × 10 −26 ) and coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 1.64 [95% CI = 1.43–1.88]; p < 1.61 × 10 −12 ) were the top two most significantly enriched codes ( Table S4 ), suggestive of underlying increased prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in this population. Likewise, we observed a cluster of significantly enriched endocrine- and metabolic-related phecodes, with 28% (9/32) significantly enriched in AJs, among which the top phecodes were chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (OR = 4.16 [95% CI = 3.62–4.78]; p < 2.31 × 10 −89 ) and hypothyroidism (OR = 1.65 [95% CI = 1.49–1.83]; p < 3.00 × 10 −21 ), suggesting an increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease in this population. Taken together, this analysis suggests that identification of fine-scale genetic communities can help to elucidate the presence of population health disparities within healthcare systems.
To understand how fine-scale IBD-communities impact our understanding of the prevalence of Mendelian conditions, we generated a curated dataset of founder variants previously reported in the literature. We focused on founder variants reported in AJ and PR populations, as these were the two largest communities in Bio Me exhibiting evidence of founder effects. We initially identified a total of n = 82 AJ and n = 11 PR variants that were observed in one or more individuals in the N = 27,727 unrelated (<2nd degree) Bio Me participants for whom exome sequence data were available ( Table S5 ). Via literature review, we were able to determine that for N = 32 of the AJ and N = 4 of the PR variants, founder effect status was supported by haplotypic evidence. We excluded four variants due to evidence of moderate-to-low penetrance, APC. c.3920T>A ( Boursi et al., 2013 15. Boursi, B. ∙ Sella, T. ∙ Liberman, E. ...

Med. 2010; 170 :1463-1469 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of the remaining variants, 28/30 had a pathogenic or pathogenic/likely pathogenic assertion in ClinVar, meaning the assertions were supported by two or more submitters with no conflicts. Two variants, CLRN1 .c.144T>G and ABCC8. c3989-9G>A, were listed with conflicting evidence of pathogenicity in ClinVar; however, upon further inspection were interpreted as pathogenic for the specific conditions under examination and therefore were included in downstream analysis. The final dataset contained N = 27 AJ and N = 3 PR founder variants, seven linked to two autosomal dominant (AD) disorders (hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome) and 23 linked to 19 autosomal recessive (AR) disorders. There were 1,099 (3.96%) variant-positive Bio Me participants (N = 986 that carried one variant and N = 113 that carried two variants), for an overall prevalence of 1 in 313 for AD and 1 in 27 for AR founder variants ( Boursi et al., 2013 15.

To evaluate the population specificity and accuracy of prevalence estimates of Mendelian founder variants in Bio Me , we examined the participant-reported answers to survey questions compared with IBD community membership. We restricted analysis to the subset of N = 27,627 participants for whom we had complete survey information for both self-reported R/E and self-reported country of origin. For AJ founder variants, we examined answers to the question “What ethnic groups are part of your family background?” for variant-positive Bio Me participants ( Table S6 ). Of the 946 participants who harbored an AJ founder variant, 182 (19.2%) only self-reported as Jewish, 471 (49.8%) only as Caucasian/white, 168 (17.8%) as both, and 125 (13.2%) selected a different answer. By contrast, 919 (97.1%) were members of the AJ IBD community. We repeated this analysis for the three PR founder variants. Of the 145 participants who harbored a PR founder variant, 135 (93.1%) only self-reported as HL, 0 (0%) only self-reported as Caucasian/white, 1 (0.7%) as both, and 9 (6.2%) selected a different answer. When examining prevalences based on answers to the survey question “Where were you born?”, we observed that 63 (43.4%) self-reported being born in PR, 78 (53.8%) in the United States, and 4 (2.8%) selected a different answer. By contrast, 141 (97.2%) were members of the PR IBD community. We then used IBD communities to calculate per-variant prevalence, yielding rates ranging from 1:108 to 1:4,102 for AD and from 1:23 to 1:820 for AR variants ( Table 1 ). This analysis demonstrates that by linking disease variants to IBD communities and modeling the genetic estimates of the specific founder events that give rise to disease variants, we can improve our understanding of the population specificity and accuracy of prevalence rates.
Next, we investigated the impact of fine-scale population structure, as captured by IBD communities, on complex disease. We focused on PRSs, which predict complex disease risk by aggregating the contributions of many variants associated with disease across an individual’s genome into a single risk score. We selected previously validated and published PRS for five common diseases with major public health impact: cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer ( Khera et al., 2018 44. Khera, A.V. ∙ Chaffin, M. ∙ Aragam, K.G. ... Genome-wide polygenic scores for common diseases identify individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic mutations Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :1219-1224 Crossref Scopus (1698) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since these PRSs were derived and validated in individuals of primarily European ancestry, we restricted our analyses to European ancestry participants in Bio Me , to avoid confounding due to genetic ancestry ( Martin et al., 2017 54. Martin, A.R. ∙ Gignoux, C.R. ∙ Walters, R.K. ... Human Demographic History Impacts Genetic Risk Prediction across Diverse Populations Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2017; 100 :635-649 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (772) PubMed Google Scholar ; De La Vega and Bustamante, 2018 29. De La Vega, F.M. ∙ Bustamante, C.D. Polygenic risk scores: a biased prediction? Genome Med. 2018; 10 :100 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martin et al., 2019 56. Martin, A.R. ∙ Kanai, M. ∙ Kamatani, Y. ... Clinical use of current polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :584-591 Crossref Scopus (1286) PubMed Google Scholar ). This allowed us to calculate PRS distributions for each disease in European ancestry participants (N = 10,273) and normalize the distributions as Z scores (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). We then stratified the participants into members of the AJ IBD community (N = 4,337) and non-Jewish EA IBD communities (N = 5,936) and re-examined the normalized distributions. We observed that the distribution of the PRS between communities were significantly different for all five diseases examined ( Figure 4 B; two-sided t test), with the largest difference observed for T2D (Δmean = 0.77, p < 1 × 100 −300 ) and the smallest for inflammatory bowel disease (Δmean = 0.11, p < 4.0 × 10 −7 ). Notably, we saw a significantly elevated prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease within the topmost decile in the AJ IBD community, relative to the non-Jewish EA ( Figure 4 C; chi-square test p < 0.0006). Furthermore, we observed significant differences in predictive power for the PRS for inflammatory bowel disease between the non-Jewish EA and AJ IBD communities, respectively (area under the curve [AUC] = 56.56% [95% CI = 50.43–62.69], AUC = 65.57% [95% CI = 60.50–70.63]; p < 0.013). These observed differences across communities mirror previously observed differences in PRS performance across continental ancestry groups attributable to the impact of genetic drift in the calculation of PRS, rather than differences in genetic contributions ( Martin et al., 2019 56. Martin, A.R. ∙ Kanai, M. ∙ Kamatani, Y. ... Clinical use of current polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :584-591 Crossref Scopus (1286) PubMed Google Scholar ). This highlights the growing importance of understanding fine-scale population structure in PRS models.

Section: Discussion

Here, we demonstrate how genetic ancestry may be used for fine-scale population health monitoring in medicine. We examine the intersection of R/E, captured both as EHR and self-reported, and genetic ancestry in a large urban health system and show how EHR reporting imperfectly captures R/E compared with self-reporting, while genetic ancestry reveals additional complexity in population structure compared with self-reporting. We apply a framework to detect fine-scale population structure by characterizing a network of distant relatedness within patients in the Bio Me biobank and show 17 distinct IBD communities that are highly correlated with culturally endogamous groups and recent diaspora to NYC from countries around the world. By linking to EHRs and testing for enrichment of ICD-9/10-based health outcomes within uncovered communities, we demonstrate a significant community-specific enrichment of both anticipated and novel health-related traits. This suggests that IBD communities could be used to identify patient populations at elevated risk for diseases that may not be otherwise captured via available population labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate significant differences in the distribution and accuracy of PRS for common disease between two IBD communities of shared continental ancestry, suggesting that fine-scale genetic structure elucidated by these community definitions may also have important implications for improving genomic risk prediction for common diseases.
This work also elucidates the extent and complexity of founder populations in NYC. We show that many of the IBD communities exhibit evidence of founder effects, as demonstrated by elevated levels of autozygosity, median within-community IBD sharing, and application of methods that measure the degree of distance between communities in the network topology. This approach resulted in more accurate prevalence estimates for founder variants linked to genetic disorders compared with those derived using populations defined by self-reported R/E or geographical region of origin. This suggests that IBD communities could be used to identify patient populations at elevated risk for genetic disorders that may not be otherwise captured via available population labels. We identified both canonical founder populations with known historical evidence of founder events, including AJ ( Atzmon et al., 2010 10. Atzmon, G. ∙ Hao, L. ∙ Pe’er, I. ...

Ancestry-specific recent effective population size in the Americas PLoS Genet. 2018; 14 :e1007385 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) descents. Overall approximately one-quarter of Bio Me participants harbor genetic signatures of founder effects, and extrapolating this observation to the demographics of NYC, we estimate that approximately 15% of New Yorkers could be genetically linked to one or more founder populations. This finding mirrors similar observations of founder effects in large, predominantly European ancestry biobanks in Finland ( Martin et al., 2018 55. Martin, A.R. ∙ Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Kerminen, S. ... Haplotype Sharing Provides Insights into Fine-Scale Population History and Disease in Finland Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2018; 102 :760-775 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) and rural Pennsylvania ( Staples et al., 2018 83. Staples, J. ∙ Maxwell, E.K. ∙ Gosalia, N. ...

Genet. 2018; 102 :874-889 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), where founder effects were found to be ubiquitous in the former and in approximately one-fifth of the latter cohort. A recent study of a direct-to-consumer genetic database of approximately 770,000 customers across the United States also revealed myriad signatures of founder effects that could be attributed to pre-diaspora population structure and/or post-diaspora isolation, i.e., multiple Irish ancestry groups in Boston ( Han et al., 2017 37. Han, E. ∙ Carbonetto, P. ∙ Curtis, R.E. ... Clustering of 770,000 genomes reveals post-colonial population structure of North America Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14238 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that as more massive-scale population-based biobanks emerge, evidence will increasingly show that founder effects and founder populations may be more common, and their origins more complex, than previously thought.
A better understanding of population structure may also impact the use of genomic information to inform patient care of genetically driven disease, such as cancer detection and treatment ( Deng and Nakamura, 2017 30. Deng, X. ∙ Nakamura, Y. Cancer Precision Medicine: From Cancer Screening to Drug Selection and Personalized Immunotherapy Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2017; 38 :15-24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), pre- and perinatal testing ( Peters et al., 2015 72. Peters, D.G. ∙ Yatsenko, S.A. ∙ Surti, U. ... Recent advances of genomic testing in perinatal medicine Semin. Perinatol. 2015; 39 :44-54 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hui and Bianchi, 2017 42. Hui, L. ∙ Bianchi, D.W. Noninvasive Prenatal DNA Testing: The Vanguard of Genomic Medicine Annu. Rev. Med. 2017; 68 :459-472 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), and new applications of routine genomic screening for preventive health ( Trivedi, 2017 90. Trivedi, B.P. Medicine’s future? Science. 2017; 358 :436-440 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, in recent work in the same populations, we showed that individuals with AJ founder variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were twice as likely to have undergone clinical genetic testing compared with other groups with founder variants in these genes, despite similar rates of cancer ( Abul-Husn et al., 2019 3. Abul-Husn, N.S. ∙ Soper, E.R. ∙ Odgis, J.A. ... Exome sequencing reveals a high prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder variants in a diverse population-based biobank Genome Med. 2019; 12 :2 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). A lack of patient and/or provider awareness about population-specific risks may impact rates of genetic testing ( Williams et al., 2019 94. Williams, C.D. ∙ Bullard, A.J. ∙ O’Leary, M. ... Racial/Ethnic Disparities in BRCA Counseling and Testing: a Narrative Review J. Racial Ethn. Health Disparities. 2019; 6 :570-583 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). For common diseases, which are largely influenced by non-genetic factors, but nevertheless may also have a substantial genetic component, this is particularly true. Understanding complex patterns of distant relatedness at a population level can provide simultaneous insights into both genetic and environmental factors underlying disease. For example, the observed elevation of risk for asthma in PR populations can be linked to a host of environmental and socioeconomic contributing factors differentially impacting PRs compared with other Hispanic/Latinx groups, while PR-specific genetic determinants have yet to be identified ( Szentpetery et al., 2016 85. Szentpetery, S.E. ∙ Forno, E. ∙ Canino, G. ... Asthma in Puerto Ricans: Lessons from a high-risk population J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2016; 138 :1556-1558 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). This demonstrates how genomics can be an extremely useful tool to help uncover non-genetic disease factors contributing to common disease and also cautions against oversimplified assumptions that one population group is more genetically predisposed to disease versus another.
Our approach has a number of limitations that we highlight here. The fine-scale population structure in the Bio Me biobank uncovered by our approach is often strongly correlated with certain population labels and demographic information captured by our survey instruments. However, as no ground truth information exists by which to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of community assignments, the community labels must be considered supported by evidence rather than definitive. In some cases, we demonstrated weak evidence of correlation with collected population labels, which was challenging to interpret, most notably for the putative Garifuna community. Evidence to support the community assignment was limited to the observations of (1) tight clustering of individuals in PCA space, indicating uniform proportions of African and Amerindigenous genetic ancestry in community members, which are each indicative of a founder population; and (2) evidence of a very tight bottleneck using IBD tract-length modeling, the timing of which is coincident with the known historical founder events in the Garifuna population. However, we demonstrate that even in the absence of conclusive evidence to ascribed population labels, consistent and well-defined genetic communities can be clinically useful. Finally, the success of defining IBD-based communities is contingent on existing patterns of assortative mating in a given population dataset, which is influenced by cultural endogamy, patterns of migration, geographical proximity, and other demographic forces. In addition, a person could have ancestry from two or more communities or self-reported groups (6.5% of participants in this study). In these instances, any one particular community assignment may be sub-optimal for precision medicine applications and indicates future directions to develop methods that can model population structure jointly as continuous and discrete processes.
This work contributes to the ongoing conversation about the role of R/E in medicine. Some have argued that R/E is not biologically meaningful ( King and Owens, 2001 45. King, M.C. ∙ Owens, K. Genomic views of human history Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2001; 286 :384-387 Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar ; Cooper et al., 2003 27. Cooper, R.S. ∙ Kaufman, J.S. ∙ Ward, R. Race and genomics N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348 :1166-1170 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ) and have demonstrated potential harms connected to the use of race in patient care ( Vyas et al., 2020 93. Vyas, D.A. ∙ Eisenstein, L.G. ∙ Jones, D.S. Hidden in Plain Sight - Reconsidering the Use of Race Correction in Clinical Algorithms N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :874-882 Crossref Scopus (945) PubMed Google Scholar ). Others contend that R/E categories are correlated with underlying genetic and/or socioeconomic factors impacting disease and that capturing R/E information is biologically and clinically useful ( Burchard et al., 2003 19. Burchard, E.G. ∙ Ziv, E. ∙ Coyle, N. ... The importance of race and ethnic background in biomedical research and clinical practice N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348 :1170-1175 Crossref Scopus (906) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we demonstrate that embedding genomic data in health systems, and using it to infer genetic ancestry, will allow the development of evidence-based means to utilize R/E, genetic ancestry, and the socioeconomic determinants of health for both rare and common diseases. Finally, the network-based machine learning approaches applied here are highly scalable to very large datasets of individuals. As more genomic data become available in health systems globally ( Stark et al., 2019 84. Stark, Z. ∙ Dolman, L. ∙ Manolio, T.A. ... Integrating Genomics into Healthcare: A Global Responsibility Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2019; 104 :13-20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ), and via large research projects ( Bycroft et al., 2018 20. Bycroft, C. ∙ Freeman, C. ∙ Petkova, D. ...

Furthermore, as EHRs evolve and increase in resolution of longitudinal phenome data ( Abul-Husn and Kenny, 2019 2. Abul-Husn, N.S. ∙ Kenny, E.E. Personalized Medicine and the Power of Electronic Health Records Cell. 2019; 177 :58-69 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ), they will offer enhanced opportunities to monitor health in real time, allowing for agile programs of discovery, prediction, and intervention.

The Bio Me Biobank is an electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobank of over 60,000 participants from the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York, NY. Participant recruitment into Bio Me has been ongoing since 2007, and occurs predominantly through ambulatory care practices across the MSHS. Bio Me participants consent to provide DNA and plasma samples linked to their de-identified EHRs. Participants provide additional information on self-reported ancestry, personal and family history through questionnaires administered upon enrollment. This study was approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai’s Institutional Review Board (Institutional Review Board 07–0529). All study participants provided written informed consent.
Participant R/E was solicited in the form of the multiple-choice question with nine options to choose from (the exact phrasing of the question and corresponding response options are delineated in Table S6 ). Prior to 2014, in addition to a multiple-choice question about R/E, participants were also given the option to report their country of birth. After 2014, enrolling participants were provided with options to report the country of birth of both their parents and grandparents as well. All participants recorded answers to survey question 1, and 43.6% of participants also provided responses to survey question 2.
Bio Me participants (N = 32595) were genotyped on the Illumina Global Screening Array (GSA) platform. Quality control (QC) of the GSA data for N = 32595 participants and n = 635623 variants was performed stratified by R/E category. Individuals with an R/E-specific heterozygosity rate that surpassed ± 6 standard deviations of the population-specific mean, along with individuals with a call rate of < 95% were removed (N = 684 participants in total). N = 80 individuals were then removed for exhibiting persistent discordance between EHR-recorded and genetic sex. A further N = 126 duplicate individuals were also excluded from downstream analysis. In total 31705 passed sample level QC for downstream analysis. All quality control steps were conducted using Plink(v1.90b3.43) ( Purcell et al., 2007 76. Purcell, S. ∙ Neale, B. ∙ Todd-Brown, K. ... PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81 :559-575 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22449) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chang et al., 2015 25. Chang, C.C. ∙ Chow, C.C. ∙ Tellier, L.C. ... Second-generation PLINK: rising to the challenge of larger and richer datasets Gigascience. 2015; 4 :7 Crossref Scopus (6020) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sites with a call rate below 95% were excluded (n = 19253), along with sites that were seen to significantly violate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) when calculated stratified by ancestry. HWE thresholds for site exclusion varied by R/E, specifically we set a threshold of p < 1x10 −5 in for all populations except HL, where it was set to p < 1x10 −13 (n = 11503 SNPs in total). This resulted in the retention of n = 604869 sites.
Race/ethnicity (R/E) information was extracted from the Electronic Health Records (EHR) for all Bio Me participants for every available patient visit between January 2007 and December 2014. This window of time was selected as R/E was recorded using consistent categories. We do not have information whether the R/E was inputted by a medical professional or the patient. The possible R/E designations within this time frame consisted of “African American (Black),” “Asian,” “Caucasian (White),” “Hispanic/Latino,” “Native American,” “Other,” “Pacific Islander” or “Unknown.” For individuals who had greater than one interaction with the healthcare system and conflicting EHR recorded R/E, we selected the R/E designation assigned at their earliest visit for downstream comparison to self-reported R/E. We mapped EHR recorded R/E to self-reported R/E for N = 36061 Bio Me participants across 1492428 healthcare visits in total. For individuals who only self-reported one R/E, in instances where that category had a direct mapping to one of the EHR R/E variables, we made a direct comparison between self-reported and EHR recorded R/E to calculate the percentage of individuals who had been miss-classified in the EHR, with the exception that we collapsed individuals who self-identified as “ Caucasian/White ” (N = 7691), “ Jewish ” (N = 934), or both (N = 935) into one group that we describe as “ European American ,” and mapped this to the EHR category of “Caucasian (White).” We also mapped individuals who self-identified as “East or Southeast Asian (i.e. China Japan Korea Indonesia)” only to the EHR category “ Asian .” The additional R/E categories derived from the Bio Me survey were specifically namely “ South Asian ,” “ Mediterranean ,” “ Other ,” or “ Multiple ” selected ethnicities at enrollment ( Table S1 ; N = 5685 individuals across 182149 healthcare visits). Individuals who self-reported as South Asian were most often classified as “Other” (45.9%) or “Asian” (25.8%). Individuals who self-identified as “ Mediterranean ” were most often classified as “Caucasian (White)” (59.6%) or “Other” (15.7%), while for individuals who either self-reported as “ Other ” or who checked multiple categories there was no clear majority designation ( Figure S1 A).
To explore the relationship between self-reported R/E and genetic ancestry for the N = 31705 Bio Me participants genotyped on the GSA array, we collapsed self-reported R/E information into 8 categories: “African American/African” (N = 7055), “East/South-East Asian” (N = 784), “South Asian” (N = 622), “Native American” (N = 55); participants who selected “Caucasian/White,” “Jewish” or both were designated “European American” (N = 8619), and participants who selected “Hispanic/Latin American” and any other category were designated as “Hispanic/Latino” (N = 10682). Participants who selected “Mediterranean,” “Other” or both were designated as “Other” (N = 2559). Finally, participants who selected any other combination of multiple categories were designated as “Multiple Selected” (N = 1329).
Pairwise kinship coefficients were estimated for all Bio Me participants (N = 31705) using all N = 604869 SNPs that passed QC using the KING software ( Manichaikul et al., 2010 52. Manichaikul, A. ∙ Mychaleckyj, J.C. ∙ Rich, S.S. ... Robust relationship inference in genome-wide association studies Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2867-2873 Crossref Scopus (1635) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v1.4) by passing the –kinship flag.
Prior to calculating PCA we restricted analysis to common (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01), autosomal sites. We also removed regions of the genome known to be under recent selection, specifically HLA (chr6: 27032221-35032223, hg38), LCT (chr2:134242429-136242430), an inversion on chromosome 8 (chr8:6142478-16142491), a region of extended LD on chromosome 17 (chr17:41843748-46922634), EDAR (chr2:108383544-109383544), SLC2A5 (chr15:47707803-48707803), and TRBV9 (chr7:142391891-142392412). Finally, the GSA data was intersected with and merged with genome sequence data from 26 populations in 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 reference panels ( The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015 88. The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium. A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (10306) PubMed Google Scholar ) (TGP; N = 2504), and 53 populations in the Human Genome Diversity Panel ( Cann et al., 2002 22. Cann, H.M. ∙ de Toma, C. ∙ Cazes, L. ... A human genome diversity cell line panel Science. 2002; 296 :261-262 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) (HGDP; N = 986) and 8 additional reference panels genotyped as part of the PAGE consortium (Bari, Khomani, Nama, Oaxacan, Peru Warao, Yukpa, Zapotec) from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE; N = 700) study, both genotyped on the Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGA). This resulted in a total of n = 260502 snps and N = 35854 individuals. The first 20 PCs were calculated using PLINK (v1.9). We also ran ADMIXTURE ( Alexander et al., 2009 5. Alexander, D.H. ∙ Novembre, J. ∙ Lange, K. Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1655-1664 Crossref Scopus (5179) PubMed Google Scholar ) with 5-fold cross validation from k = 2 to k = 12 across all individuals inferred to be unrelated (N = 32354 in total, including reference panels), by randomly removing one of each individual in a pairwise relationship defined by KING to be greater than 3 rd degree relatives (as defined by a pairwise kinship coefficient of > = 0.0442 in the KING output; this resulted in the exclusion of N = 3500 Bio Me participants in total). To visualize fine-scale population substructure we applied the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) ( McInnes et al., 2018 58. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2018; https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426 Google Scholar ) to the first 10 principal components across all samples using the “umap” library in R using the default parameters.
Prior to phasing and inference of Identity-by-Descent, the GSA array data for Bio Me participants was lifted over to GRCh37/hg19, before additional quality control was performed on variants, including the removal of SNPs with a call rate below 99% (n = 48436) and variants with a MAF < 1% (n = 135011). Palindromic variants were also excluded at this stage (n = 4375). The data was subsequently merged with the TGP reference panels (N = 2504 individuals), and only intersecting sites were retained, resulting in the retention of n = 402042 SNPs in total. Phasing was subsequently performed per autosome on all N = 34209 individuals with the SHAPEIT software ( O’Connell et al., 2014 68. O’Connell, J. ∙ Gurdasani, D. ∙ Delaneau, O. ... A general approach for haplotype phasing across the full spectrum of relatedness PLoS Genet. 2014; 10 :e1004234 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( v2.r790 ) using the hapmapII genetic map (build: GRCh37/hg19) using default flags and –output-max –force. Phased haplotypes were subsequently converted to plink format and IBD was called using the iLASH software(Shemirani et al., no date) using the following flags:
slice_size 400, step_size 400, perm_count 12, shingle_size 20, shingle_overlap 0, bucket_count 4, max_thread 20, match_threshold 0.99, interest_threshold 0.70, max_error 0, min_length 3
For quality control, IBD tracts that overlapped with low complexity regions were excluded, along with IBD tracts that fell within regions of excessive IBD sharing, which we defined as regions of the genome where the level of pairwise IBD sharing exceeded 3 standard deviations above the genome-wide mean ( Figure S4 C).
To construct the IBD network, IBD tracts along the genome were summed between each pair of individuals inferred to be 2 nd degree relatives or less from Bio Me and the 1000 genomes reference panel (N = 31688 individuals in total (N = 29184 of which were Bio Me participants inferred to be < 2nd degree relatives, and N = 2504 samples from TGP)) to generate the total sum of IBD sharing per pairwise relationship. This was used to construct an adjacency matrix where each node represents an individual and each weighted edge represents the pairwise sum of IBD sharing. To detect the presence of structure within the IBD network we used the implementation of InfoMap ( Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008 78. Rosvall, M. ∙ Bergstrom, C.T. Maps of random walks on complex networks reveal community structure Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :1118-1123 Crossref Scopus (3235) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the iGraph package (R version 3.2.0). Visualization of the IBD network was also performed using iGraph using a Fruchtermen-Reingold layout (with n = 1000 iterations), after excluding poorly connected nodes (< 30 connections).
We define neighborhood matrices as a matrix-representation of the community assignments determined by using InfoMap (InfoMap assigns each individual one and only one community). A neighborhood matrix is an n x n order matrix, where n is the total number of individuals in the IBD network. Individuals i and j are assigned a 1 for the same community, and 0 for different communities, corresponding to positions N ij and N ji . We can extend this scheme across multiple runs of clustering estimation, particularly crucial when measuring concordance across runs. To compare the “neighborhood” of individual k across multiple runs, we use a Jaccard similarity coefficient to measure positive concordance: J = Intersection(row(k) = 1)/Union(row(k) = 1)
The Jaccard similarity coefficient obtained while comparing the k-th row of N_1 and the k-th row of N_2 constitutes a natural measure of community consistency across runs, with J = 1 if k has exactly the same neighbors in the two matrices N_1 and N_2, J = 0 if k does not share any neighbors between the two matrices. This then naturally can be averaged across the entire matrix to determine overall similarity of community assignments between different runs of InfoMap. We use this as our statistic for our permutation testing, by comparing our observed network structure to topologically similar random networks with consistent numbers of edges created with the Erdős–Rényi (ER) model. An empirical p value ascertaining the stability of community assignments represents the probability of randomly obtaining an identical neighborhood matrix as the neighborhood matrix obtained by running InfoMap with the original IBD network.
Community assignments were ascertained by using InfoMap both for stability and robusticity on the original IBD-based network (10 times) and on 100 sets of topologically similar random networks generated with the ER model. We computed the clustering coefficient (i.e. the ratio of existing edges between the neighbors of a specific node relative to the total number of potential edges between said neighbors) for each community. In addition, we used the Wasserstein distance ( Villani, 2009 92. Villani, C. The Wasserstein distances Optimal Transport. Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften (A Series of Comprehensive Studies in Mathematics), Volume 338 Springer, 2009; 93-111 Crossref Google Scholar ).
To explore the correlation between self-reported country of origin, subcontinent and R/E and IBD community membership for Bio Me participants we calculated Positive Predictive Values (PPVs), Negative Predictive Values (NPVs), sensitivity and specificity for each self-reported label versus membership of each IBD community using the “caret” library in R ( Kuhn, 2008 48. Kuhn, M. Building Predictive Models in R Using the caret Package J. Stat. Softw. 2008; 28 :1-26 Crossref Scopus (5169) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each of these metrics we treated the self-reported information as the ‘ground truth’ and the IBD-community designation as the predictor. For the analyses by country and subcontinental origin, US-born Bio Me participants were excluded from the calculations.
Runs of homozygosity were also calculated using bcftools/1.0 ( Narasimhan et al., 2016 65. Narasimhan, V. ∙ Danecek, P. ∙ Scally, A. ... BCFtools/RoH: a hidden Markov model approach for detecting autozygosity from next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :1749-1751 Crossref Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis was performed stratified by IBD community, and using IBD community specific allele frequencies and including genetic maps. Post ROH inference, analysis was restricted to tracts of greater than 3MB in length.
15665 unique ICD-9 and ICD-10 billing codes from the Mount Sinai Bio Me biobank were collapsed into 1764 phenotype codes (Phecodes) ( Wu et al., 2019 96. Wu, P. ∙ Gifford, A. ∙ Meng, X. ... Developing and Evaluating Mappings of ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM Codes to PheCodes JMIR Med. Inform. 2019; 7 :e14325 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ; Denny et al., 2010 31. Denny, J.C. ∙ Ritchie, M.D. ∙ Basford, M.A. ... PheWAS: demonstrating the feasibility of a phenome-wide scan to discover gene-disease associations Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :1205-1210 Crossref Scopus (746) PubMed Google Scholar ) on the basis of the PheWAS catalog ( https://www.phewascatalog.org ) using an in-house R script (R version 3.4.1).
We performed logistic regression systematically across 1764 phecodes and all IBD communities with > = 500 members who were also Bio Me participants (N = 7 in total), (i.e., excluding communities predominantly composed of individuals from the 1000 Genomes Reference panel). To avoid spurious association, phecodes that were present in less than 10 instances per community were excluded from the analyses. To perform the regression we encoded IBD community membership as a binary predictor variable and generated Plink format “ped” files for each community, where community membership was encoded as “1” and non-membership encoded as “2.” We then performed logistic regression for each phecode and for each community using Plink(v1.9), adjusting for age and sex as covariates, and excluding 2nd degree relatives and above. Statistical significance was determined for each IBD community-wide association via Bonferroni correction.
Imputation was performed on phased haplotypes (described previously) using IMPUTE(v2.3.2) ( Howie et al., 2009 41. Howie, B.N. ∙ Donnelly, P. ∙ Marchini, J. A flexible and accurate genotype imputation method for the next generation of genome-wide association studies PLoS Genet. 2009; 5 :e1000529 Crossref Scopus (2992) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the phase III Thousand Genomes data as reference panel, and the addition of the following flag: “-filt_rules_1 ‘ALL<0.0002’ ‘ALL>0.9998’. Weights for polygenic risk scores (PRS) for five diseases and body mass index (BMI) were downloaded from: http://kp4cd.org/dataset_downloads/mi
PRS were calculated for each of the five diseases across all N = 31705 Bio Me participants by summing genotype data previously imputed to the Thousands Genomes Phase III reference panel using the “ –score sum ” flag in PLINK(v1.9) and participants were subsequently stratified into groups based on their IBD community membership for further analysis. PRS performance was assessed by calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) using the pROC package ( Robin et al., 2011 77. Robin, X. ∙ Turck, N. ∙ Hainard, A. ... pROC: an open-source package for R and S+ to analyze and compare ROC curves BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :77 Crossref Scopus (7645) PubMed Google Scholar ) in R using disease case status for a given phecode as the outcome variable, and PRS as the predictor variable.
Founder variants for both the AJ and PR communities were curated via literature review and extracted from exome data available for the N = 27727 Bio Me participants that were a part of the community detection analysis. The number of heterozygous carriers for each variant was then ascertained for the subset of N = 27627 participants for whom the self-reported ancestry survey information was complete. This analysis was performed stratified by self-reported R/E, self-reported country of origin, and IBD-community membership using PLINK(v1.9)
