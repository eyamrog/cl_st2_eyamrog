Title: Molecular mechanism of prestin electromotive signal amplification


Abstract: Summary

Hearing involves two fundamental processes: mechano-electrical transduction and signal amplification. Despite decades of studies, the molecular bases for both remain elusive. Here, we show how prestin, the electromotive molecule of outer hair cells (OHCs) that senses both voltage and membrane tension, mediates signal amplification by coupling conformational changes to alterations in membrane surface area. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human prestin bound with chloride or salicylate at a common “anion site” adopt contracted or expanded states, respectively. Prestin is ensconced within a perimeter of well-ordered lipids, through which it induces dramatic deformation in the membrane and couples protein conformational changes to the bulk membrane. Together with computational studies, we illustrate how the anion site is allosterically coupled to changes in the transmembrane domain cross-sectional area and the surrounding membrane. These studies provide insight into OHC electromotility by providing a structure-based mechanism of the membrane motor prestin.

Section: Introduction

Hearing is the final sensory modality for which there is, at present, no elucidated molecular mechanism. The outer hair cells (OHCs) in the mammalian cochlea are crucial to hearing because they mediate signal amplification via an active mechanical feedback that enhances the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of sound stimuli ( Ashmore, 2019 7.

(Editors) in: Understanding the Cochlea. 2017; 113-145 Google Scholar ). Loss of OHCs due to excessive noise, ototoxic drugs, or normal aging leads to reduction of sound sensitivity and ability to distinguish sounds ( Gummer and Preyer, 1997 32. Gummer, A.W. ∙ Preyer, S. Cochlear amplification and its pathology: emphasis on the role of the tectorial membrane Ear Nose Throat J. 1997; 76 :151-158 160, 162–163 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Driven by changes in membrane potential, OHCs exhibit fast changes in length along the axial direction at acoustic frequencies up to 80 kHz ( Ashmore, 1987 6. Ashmore, J.F.

Prestin-driven cochlear amplification is not limited by the outer hair cell membrane time constant Neuron. 2011; 70 :1143-1154 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ), deemed electromotility (eM). eM is defined by classic electrical signatures, including charge movements across the electric field and non-linear capacitance (NLC) ( Santos-Sacchi, 1991 77. Santos-Sacchi, J. Reversible inhibition of voltage-dependent outer hair cell motility and capacitance J. Neurosci. 1991; 11 :3096-3110 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Prestin, a member of solute carrier 26 (SLC26) anion transporter family, is the motor protein responsible for the fast eM of OHCs ( Zheng et al., 2000 100. Zheng, J. ∙ Shen, W. ∙ He, D.Z. ... Prestin is the motor protein of cochlear outer hair cells Nature. 2000; 405 :149-155 Crossref Scopus (1054) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is abundantly expressed in the OHC lateral membrane ( Gale and Ashmore, 1997 25.

Prestin acts directly on the membranes deriving energy from the OHC’s transmembrane potential, which together with its fast kinetics set it apart from other molecular motors, such as cytoskeletal or rotary motors ( Dallos and Fakler, 2002 17.

The deletion of prestin in mice results in the loss of eM, shortened OHCs, and a reduction of hearing sensitivity of 40–60 dB ( Liberman et al., 2002 49. Liberman, M.C. ∙ Gao, J. ∙ He, D.Z. ... Prestin is required for electromotility of the outer hair cell and for the cochlear amplifier Nature. 2002; 419 :300-304 Crossref Scopus (732) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutations in human prestin are associated with deafness ( Mutai et al., 2013 61. Mutai, H. ∙ Suzuki, N. ∙ Shimizu, A. ... Diverse spectrum of rare deafness genes underlies early-childhood hearing loss in Japanese patients: a cross-sectional, multi-center next-generation sequencing study Orphanet J. Rare Dis. 2013; 8 :172 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prestin also amplifies cardiomyocyte motion ( Zhang et al., 2021 98. Zhang, X.D. ∙ Thai, P.N. ∙ Ren, L. ... Prestin amplifies cardiac motor functions Cell Rep. 2021; 35 :109097 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a more widespread function beyond the inner ear.

Intracellular anions, particularly Cl − , are indispensable for the normal function of prestin and regulate the eM of prestin, including shifting the NLC voltage dependence ( Oliver et al., 2001 64.

Santos-Sacchi, J. ∙ Song, L. ∙ Zheng, J. ... Control of mammalian cochlear amplification by chloride anions J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :3992-3998 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Salicylate, a widely used drug, reversibly inhibits eM and causes hearing loss or tinnitus at high doses ( Kakehata and Santos-Sacchi, 1996 46. Kakehata, S. ∙ Santos-Sacchi, J.

Salicylate ototoxicity; a clinical and experimental study Arch. Otolaryngol. 1965; 82 :483-493 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). The importance of anions to prestin function initially suggested that Cl − acts as an extrinsic voltage sensor ( Oliver et al., 2001 64. Oliver, D. ∙ He, D.Z. ∙ Klöcker, N. ... Intracellular anions as the voltage sensor of prestin, the outer hair cell motor protein Science. 2001; 292 :2340-2343 Crossref Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ), but more recent evidence suggested that anions, such as Cl − , play an allosteric role ( Rybalchenko and Santos-Sacchi, 2003 74. Rybalchenko, V. ∙ Santos-Sacchi, J. Allosteric modulation of the outer hair cell motor protein prestin by chloride World Scientific, Gummer, A.W.

Conformational state-dependent anion binding in prestin: evidence for allosteric modulation Biophys. J. 2010; 98 :371-376 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prestin is also sensitive to membrane tension ( Iwasa, 1993 41. Iwasa, K.H. Effect of stress on the membrane capacitance of the auditory outer hair cell Biophys. J. 1993; 65 :492-498 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ; Santos-Sacchi et al., 2001 82. Santos-Sacchi, J. ∙ Shen, W. ∙ Zheng, J. ... Effects of membrane potential and tension on prestin, the outer hair cell lateral membrane motor protein J.

Kamar, R.I. ∙ Organ-Darling, L.E. ∙ Raphael, R.M. Membrane cholesterol strongly influences confined diffusion of prestin Biophys.

Here, we carry out single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), molecular dynamics simulations, and electrophysiology to illuminate multiple high-resolution structures of prestin and to provide a structural basis for its electromotive, membrane-sensitive properties, thereby providing the molecular basis for signal amplification in hearing.

Section: Results and discussion

We expressed full-length human prestin fused with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) and an affinity tag in HEK293 GnTI − cells ( Goehring et al., 2014 29. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ) for structural and electrophysiological studies. Cells transfected with this construct produced a robust NLC with peak capacitances at −54.0 ± 3.2 mV and −51.4 ± 3.4 mV using dual-sine methodology ( Santos-Sacchi et al., 1998 81. Santos-Sacchi, J. ∙ Kakehata, S. ∙ Kikuchi, T. ... Density of motility-related charge in the outer hair cell of the guinea pig is inversely related to best frequency Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256 :155-158 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A) and a lock-in “sine+DC” method ( Gillis, 2000 27. Gillis, K.D. Admittance-based measurement of membrane capacitance using the EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439 :655-664 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S1 A–S1C), respectively. The NLC was not observed in non-transfected cells ( Figures S1 A and S1C) and was reversibly inhibited by 10 mM salicylate ( Figure 1 A), thus demonstrating that this recombinant prestin recapitulates native prestin function.
We screened solubilization conditions for prestin by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) ( Goehring et al., 2014 29. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found two peaks, suggestive of two distinct oligomerization states, dependent upon detergent solubilization conditions ( Figure S1 M). Among the panel of detergents, glycol-diogenin (GDN) resulted in the greatest fraction of the earlier eluting, hypothetically oligomeric state ( Figure S1 M). We purified the oligomeric form of prestin, in the presence of Cl − , in either GDN micelles (Pres-Cl) or in lipid nanodiscs (Pres-Cl-nanodisc) and employed single-particle cryo-EM to elucidate structures at 2.3 Å and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively ( Figures 1 , S1 N–S1P, and S2 ; Table S1 ; Methods S1 A). Reconstructions of prestin from both conditions reveal a dimeric architecture with no other oligomeric state found during data processing, indicating that prestin is a dimer. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that prestin in native OHCs can form higher oligomers due to its high level of expression or interactions with cytosolic scaffolds. We hypothesize that the later eluting FSEC peak corresponds to immature, unassembled prestin. The Pres-Cl and Pres-Cl-nanodisc structures are indistinguishable (Cα root-mean-square deviation [RMSD]: 0.2 Å; Figures S3 D and S4 C), and because of the higher resolution and better quality of the Pres-Cl map ( Figure S2 ), we used Pres-Cl for structural analysis unless specified otherwise.
Prestin forms a domain-swapped homodimer, with each protomer containing a transmembrane domain (TMD) (residues 76–504), an N-terminal domain (NTD) (residues 1–75), and a C-terminal sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist domain (STAS) (residues 505–744; Figures 1 B and 1D). The NTD and STAS domains form a dimerized “base” on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, on “top” of which two TMDs separately insert into the membrane ( Figures 1 C and 1D). The TMD adopts the UraA fold ( Lu et al., 2011 54. Lu, F. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Jiang, Y. ... Structure and mechanism of the uracil transporter UraA Nature. 2011; 472 :243-246 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a 7+7 inverted helical arrangement that can be divided into a “core” domain and a “gate” domain. Though prestin shares a similar fold to the recently resolved SLC26A9 structures ( Chi et al., 2020 14. Chi, X. ∙ Jin, X. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Structural insights into the gating mechanism of human SLC26A9 mediated by its C-terminal sequence Cell Discov. 2020; 6 :55 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Walter et al., 2019 96.

Cryo-EM structures and functional characterization of murine Slc26a9 reveal mechanism of uncoupled chloride transport eLife. 2019; 8 :e46986 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) with an overall Cα RMSD of 4.6 Å to human SLC26A9 ( Figures S5 A and S5B; Data S1 ), the high-resolution cryo-EM structures of prestin reveal significantly different structural features. A Cl − ion is located on the interface between the core and gate domains ( Figure 1 D). Over a hundred well-resolved lipid molecules, including two cholesterol molecules in the space between the TMDs ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S4 C, and S4D), reveal the extensive prestin-membrane interactions and provide a glimpse of how prestin inserts into the membrane, couples to deformation of the bulk membrane, and induces membrane curvature.
Both the NTD and STAS domains are crucial for the canonical eM function of prestin ( Bai et al., 2006 8. Bai, J.P. ∙ Navaratnam, D. ∙ Samaranayake, H. ...

The N-terminal residues form an anti-parallel β sheet (Nβ 1) ( Figure 1 D), the disruption of which abolishes the oligomerization and NLC of prestin ( Navaratnam et al., 2005 63. Navaratnam, D. ∙ Bai, J.-P. ∙ Samaranayake, H. ... N-terminal-mediated homomultimerization of prestin, the outer hair cell motor protein Biophys.

A partially membrane-embedded region, composed of three short α helices (Nα 2–4; termed the “arm” domain), forms a “paddle” to flank the TMD and is tethered to Nβ1 through a loop spanning the STAS domain. Characteristic features of the prestin STAS domain, compared to that of SLC26A9 ( Chi et al., 2020 14. Chi, X. ∙ Jin, X. ∙ Chen, Y. ...

N-terminal-mediated homomultimerization of prestin, the outer hair cell motor protein Biophys. J. 2005; 89 :3345-3352 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). Distinct from the previous crystal structure of the rat prestin STAS domain with a truncated IVS and C terminus ( Lolli et al., 2016 52. Lolli, G. ∙ Pasqualetto, E. ∙ Costanzi, E. ... The STAS domain of mammalian SLC26A5 prestin harbours an anion-binding site Biochem. J. 2016; 473 :365-370 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), the structure of the STAS domain in full-length human prestin is more similar to the structure of the chicken prestin STAS domain ( Lolli et al., 2016 52. Lolli, G. ∙ Pasqualetto, E. ∙ Costanzi, E. ... The STAS domain of mammalian SLC26A5 prestin harbours an anion-binding site Biochem. J. 2016; 473 :365-370 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) and incompatible with the proposed anion-binding site in the STAS domain ( Figure S5 B).
Unlike the well-studied voltage-sensing domain in the Kv channels ( Swartz, 2008 91. Swartz, K.J. Sensing voltage across lipid membranes Nature. 2008; 456 :891-897 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ), prestin lacks an extensively charged region in the membrane-embedded region ( Figures S5 E and S5F), and a great deal of effort has been focused on uncovering the prestin voltage-sensing region ( Bai et al., 2006 8.

A motif of eleven amino acids is a structural adaptation that facilitates motor capability of eutherian prestin J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 :1039-1047 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mapping the host of residues that affect prestin NLC onto the structure shows that they are spread throughout the sequence and the 3D structure ( Figures 1 B and S5 E). Thus, although some of these residues may not be involved in voltage sensing but rather in anion binding or in structural transitions, it is clear that residues central to prestin’s eM function are not localized to a specific region of the structure.
Anions, particularly Cl − , are essential for the eM function of prestin, which is proposed either to work as an extrinsic voltage sensor ( Oliver et al., 2001 64.

(Editor) in: Biophysics of the Cochlea: From Molecules to Models. 2003; 116-126 Google Scholar ). However, where anions bind to prestin has been elusive. Membrane proteins with a similar membrane topology, e.g., UraA ( Lu et al., 2011 54. Lu, F. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Jiang, Y. ... Structure and mechanism of the uracil transporter UraA Nature. 2011; 472 :243-246 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ) and UapA ( Alguel et al., 2016 2. Alguel, Y. ∙ Amillis, S. ∙ Leung, J. ... Structure of eukaryotic purine/H(+) symporter UapA suggests a role for homodimerization in transport activity Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11336 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) transporters, harbor their substrate-binding sites at the cleft between transmembrane helices (TMs) 3 and 10 in the central cavity at the core-gate domain interface. In the prestin structure, the equivalent site is surrounded by a positively charged yet partially hydrophobic pocket and is occupied by a Cl − ion ( Figures 2 A, 2C, S4 A, and S4B), whose stable binding was confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over the course of 1.5 μs ( Figure S6 A).
The residues that compose the anion-binding site ( Figure 2 E) play key roles in prestin function ( Gorbunov et al., 2014 30. Gorbunov, D. ∙ Sturlese, M. ∙ Nies, F. ... Molecular architecture and the structural basis for anion interaction in prestin and SLC26 transporters Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3622 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schaechinger et al., 2011 86. Schaechinger, T.J. ∙ Gorbunov, D. ∙ Halaszovich, C.R. ... A synthetic prestin reveals protein domains and molecular operation of outer hair cell piezoelectricity EMBO J. 2011; 30 :2793-2804 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). R399, the only positively charged residue close to Cl − , stabilizes the nearby residues through interactions with the side chains of N97 and S396 without direct interactions with Cl − . Mutation of R399 to cysteine, glutamine, or glutamate abolishes the NLC, and R399S positively shifts the voltage at peak capacitance (V h ) and abrogates salicylate inhibition ( Gorbunov et al., 2014 30. Gorbunov, D. ∙ Sturlese, M. ∙ Nies, F. ... Molecular architecture and the structural basis for anion interaction in prestin and SLC26 transporters Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3622 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). The side chains of N97, S396, and S398 directly interact with Cl − , consistent with the strong impact of the S398C mutation on anion interaction ( Gorbunov et al., 2014 30. Gorbunov, D. ∙ Sturlese, M. ∙ Nies, F. ... Molecular architecture and the structural basis for anion interaction in prestin and SLC26 transporters Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3622 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three hydrophobic residues, L93, F101, and P136, give the anion-binding site a partially hydrophobic character. Mutation of each of these residues individually shifts the V h toward depolarized voltages, and the triple mutant abolishes the NLC in the physiological voltage range ( Schaechinger et al., 2011 86. Schaechinger, T.J. ∙ Gorbunov, D. ∙ Halaszovich, C.R. ... A synthetic prestin reveals protein domains and molecular operation of outer hair cell piezoelectricity EMBO J. 2011; 30 :2793-2804 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, these studies in the context of the prestin structure illustrate that anion binding is critical for prestin’s eM function.
Salicylate inhibits prestin and OHC function in a Cl − -dependent manner ( Santos-Sacchi et al., 2006 83. Santos-Sacchi, J. ∙ Song, L. ∙ Zheng, J. ... Control of mammalian cochlear amplification by chloride anions J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :3992-3998 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ) and putatively locks prestin in an expanded state ( Homma and Dallos, 2011 36. Homma, K. ∙ Dallos, P. Evidence that prestin has at least two voltage-dependent steps J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :2297-2307 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Santos-Sacchi and Song, 2014 78.

Chem. 2014; 289 :10823-10830 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Replacing intracellular Cl − with sulfate substantially shifts the NLC of OHCs (V h ) toward positive membrane potential ( Muallem and Ashmore, 2006 60. Muallem, D. ∙ Ashmore, J. An anion antiporter model of prestin, the outer hair cell motor protein Biophys. J. 2006; 90 :4035-4045 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rybalchenko and Santos-Sacchi, 2008 75. Rybalchenko, V. ∙ Santos-Sacchi, J. Anion control of voltage sensing by the motor protein prestin in outer hair cells Biophys. J. 2008; 95 :4439-4447 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed NLC measurement with HEK cells expressing prestin using sulfate internal buffer (without Cl − ) and observed a similar positive shift of V h as sulfate replaces intracellular Cl − ( Figure S1 F). These NLC curves, in the presence of intracellular Cl − or sulfate, suggest that prestin likely forms a contracted state with Cl − and an expanded state with sulfate at 0 mV membrane potential. To investigate the mechanisms underlying salicylate inhibition and structural transitions, we thus replaced Cl − with sulfate and determined the structures of prestin either in the presence of 10 mM salicylate (termed Pres-Sal) or without salicylate (termed Pres-sulfate) at resolutions of 3.4 Å and 4.3 Å, respectively ( Figures S2 K–S2P). Because Pres-Sal and Pres-sulfate have similar structures (Cα RMSD: 0.6 Å; Figure S3 D) and Pres-Sal is of higher resolution, we use Pres-Sal structure for comparison with Pres-Cl unless mentioned otherwise (Cα RMSD: 1.5 Å; Figure S3 A). In the Pres-Sal structure, we observed an oval-shaped density at a similar position as Cl − in Pres-Cl, showing how salicylate not only occupies the same anion-binding site but also physically overlaps with the Cl − ion position derived from the Pres-Cl structure ( Figures 2 B, 2D, 2F, and S4 B). To rigorously assess the binding and pose of salicylate in the anion site, we fit salicylate in the Pres-Sal map and performed MD simulations ( Figure S6 C). Salicylate remains stably bound at this site during MD simulations over the course of 250 ns, as assessed by the small fluctuations in its position and orientation (≤0.5 Å displacement and ≤20° in orientation). In the resulting pose, the carboxylate group of salicylates is at a similar position to Cl − and the binding of salicylate involves the same residues as Cl − , with the aromatic ring projecting toward the core-gate domain interface. To experimentally verify this pose, we made modifications to prestin and salicylate and tested their effect on NLC. First, we reasoned that the binding site had additional space at the core-gate domain interface that should accommodate an even larger ligand. Indeed, we found that 10 mM 5-methylsalicylate inhibits the NLC of prestin similar to salicylate ( Figures 2 G, 2H, S1 D, and S1E). We furthermore reasoned that the key interaction of F101 and salicylate should not be able to accommodate any additional groups ( Figure 2 G). We therefore measured the NLC of the F101Y mutant and its inhibition by salicylate. The V h of F101Y mutant is positively shifted from −54.0 ± 3.2 mV to 5.7 ± 1.9 mV ( Figures S1 G and S1J–S1L), consistent with previous studies ( Schaechinger et al., 2011 86. Schaechinger, T.J. ∙ Gorbunov, D. ∙ Halaszovich, C.R. ... A synthetic prestin reveals protein domains and molecular operation of outer hair cell piezoelectricity EMBO J. 2011; 30 :2793-2804 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), and most importantly, the inhibition by salicylate is diminished ( Figures S1 G and S1H). Together, the observed cryo-EM density, MD simulation, and electrophysiology experiments prove that salicylate binds to the central anion-binding side.
We were unable to locate sulfate in the cryo-EM map of Pres-sulfate. However, this could be due to the lower resolution of Pres-sulfate and does not exclude binding of sulfate to the central anion site. We reasoned that, if sulfate binds to the central anion site, the F101Y mutant might change the effect of sulfate on the NLC of mutant. In the F101Y mutant, we observed a similar shift to positive potentials as in the wild type (WT) ( Figure S1 I), indicating the mutation did not affect sulfate interaction with prestin. In addition, we performed MD simulations to estimate the relative binding free energy of sulfate compared with Cl − and salicylate. The results suggest the binding of sulfate is weaker than Cl − and salicylate (unbinding free energy: salicylate > Cl − > sulfate; Figures S6 D and S6E). In summary, although binding of sulfate to the anion-binding site cannot be completely excluded, we find its binding affinity to be weaker than the other anions.
The anion-binding pockets in the Pres-Sal or Pres-sulfate structures are larger than that in the Pres-Cl structure, demonstrating that binding of different anions result in distinct conformational states within the TMD ( Figures 3 A–3C). To assess these conformational differences, we examined structural changes relative to the anion-binding site between the Pres-Cl and Pres-Sal structures ( Figures 3 D–3F). When superimposing the core domain, the gate domain undergoes a 4.6° rigid-body rotation ( Figure 3 D). Viewed from the extracellular side, the core and gate domains of Pres-Sal are more separated, resulting in a “swelling” of the TMD ( Figure 3 E). The distances between the anion-binding site and each helix in the gate domain in the Pres-Sal structure are all larger than those in the Pres-Cl structure ( Figure 3 F). TMs 5 and 12, which are the helices near the anion-binding site, have substantial distance changes in accordance with the larger substrate-binding pocket observed in the Pres-Sal structure. Thus, the TMD in the salicylate bound state is more expanded than that in the Cl − bound state.
Prestin is a member of the SLC26 anion transporter family, and thus, we sought to relate the conformational states of prestin to those observed for the related anion exchanger 1 (AE1) in an outward-facing conformation ( Arakawa et al., 2015 4. Arakawa, T. ∙ Kobayashi-Yurugi, T. ∙ Alguel, Y. ... Crystal structure of the anion exchanger domain of human erythrocyte band 3 Science. 2015; 350 :680-684 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ) and to SLC26A9 in an inward-facing conformation ( Chi et al., 2020 14. Chi, X. ∙ Jin, X. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Structural insights into the gating mechanism of human SLC26A9 mediated by its C-terminal sequence Cell Discov. 2020; 6 :55 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 G–3I). Although, in the AE1 and SLC26A9 structures, no bound anion could be resolved, those structures are consistent with anion binding in the same pocket formed by TM3 and TM10 as in prestin and involving the corresponding residues. The positions of the anion- and substrate-binding sites in prestin and these related transporters differ in their locations across the membrane. In AE1, the substrate-binding site is closest to extracellular side; in SLC26A9, the anion-binding site is closest to cytoplasmic side; and in prestin structures, they are in the middle. Among the prestin structures, the more expanded Pres-Sal or Pres-sulfate structure harbors the anion-binding site closer to the cytoplasmic side than the contracted Pres-Cl structure, suggesting the more expanded conformation of prestin is closer to an inward-facing conformation. Together with the solvent accessibility analysis ( Figures 3 A–3C), we conclude that the Pres-Cl and Pres-Sal and Pres-sulfate structures are best described as intermediate occluded-like states. Because intracellular anions can access the anion-binding site under physiological conditions ( Oliver et al., 2001 64. Oliver, D. ∙ He, D.Z. ∙ Klöcker, N. ... Intracellular anions as the voltage sensor of prestin, the outer hair cell motor protein Science. 2001; 292 :2340-2343 Crossref Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Cl − ions were observed to un- and re-bind in our MD simulations ( Figures S6 A and S6B), thermal fluctuation of the intracellular gate may allow exchange of anions in the occluded-like states.
To understand how the binding of different anions affects the prestin dimer conformation and thus the nearby membrane, we aligned the Pres-Cl and Pres-Sal structures using the structurally invariant STAS domain dimer ( Figures 4 A, 4B, S3 B, and S3C; Video S1 ). This superimposition revealed that a substantial proportion of conformational differences between the two states can be understood as a rigid-body movement between the core, gate, and STAS domain ( Figures S3 A–S3C). The gate and the core domains rotate 5° to 6° around two different axes that are at a 45° angle to the membrane bilayer but roughly perpendicular to each other. The result of these movements is a shift of TMs 2, 9, and 11 of the core domain and TMs 5b, 6, and 7 of the gate domains away from the center of the TMD ( Figure 4 A), resulting in an expansion of the TMD ( Video S1 ). Nevertheless, the gap between the “V”-shaped, separated TMDs remains almost unchanged, with the two cholesterol-like molecules bound to similar positions in Pres-Cl and Pres-Sal ( Figures S3 A and S4 D).

Conformational changes between the Pres-Cl and Pres-Sal structures, related to Figure 4
To quantify the expansion, we calculated the cross-sectional area of prestin, perpendicular to the 2-fold axis, using a Gaussian map calculated from the model coordinates ( Figure 4 C). In the TMD, Pres-Sal has a consistently increased cross-sectional area. Averaged over the transmembrane area, the difference between the cross section of Pres-Cl and Pres-Sal is about 200 Å 2 . Although the measured cross section depends on an arbitrarily chosen threshold, the difference is constant across a range of thresholds ( Figure S3 G). Furthermore, the cross sections of Pres-Cl and Pres-Sal are similar within the cytosolic domain. We performed a similar analysis on the Pres-sulfate structure and found that it was also expanded compared to Pres-Cl ( Figures S3 E and S3F). Although the Pres-sulfate structure has a slightly higher cross section than the Pres-Sal complex, the biological significance of this is unclear due to the coordinate uncertainty resulting from the lower resolution of Pres-sulfate structure. We note that this expansion will only be effectively transduced to the membrane if the overall orientation of the TMD remains unchanged, which provides an explanation for why prestin is a dimer and for the important role of the STAS domain. The magnitude of the cross section increase, roughly 5% of the total cross section area, is consistent with estimates of the electromotive change in OHC ( Ashmore, 2019 7. Ashmore, J. Outer hair cells and electromotility Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2019; 9 :a033522 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further examine the effect of prestin structural transition between the expanded and contracted forms on the membrane bilayer, we performed simulations of membrane-embedded prestin, during which the protein was steered to switch its conformation between the contracted state in the presence of Cl − and the expanded state in the presence of salicylate using a time-dependent force protocol ( Figure S6 F). Two independent simulations probed the structural changes in opposite directions, one examining the effect of prestin expansion and the other probing the effect of the protein contraction. These simulations capture the response of the membrane to the protein’s conformational changes in a consistent manner to our structural interpretation of the cryo-EM results, namely, membrane expansion due to transition of prestin from a contracted to an expanded state and membrane shrinking due to the opposite structural change of prestin.
Most models of prestin function assume that its expansion is coupled to the movement of a charged voltage sensor across the lipid membrane. There is no consensus on whether this voltage sensor consists of the bound Cl − (extrinsic voltage sensor) or of charged residues within prestin (intrinsic voltage sensor; Bai et al., 2009 9. Bai, J.P. ∙ Surguchev, A. ∙ Montoya, S. ... Prestin’s anion transport and voltage-sensing capabilities are independent Biophys. J. 2009; 96 :3179-3186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oliver et al., 2001 64. Oliver, D. ∙ He, D.Z. ∙ Klöcker, N. ... Intracellular anions as the voltage sensor of prestin, the outer hair cell motor protein Science. 2001; 292 :2340-2343 Crossref Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ). To address this question, we asked whether the anion-binding site moves across the membrane between contracted (Pres-Cl) and expanded (Pres-Sal) states. Because we cannot measure movement of the anion directly, we analyzed the movement of four residues surrounding the binding pocket: S398; Q97; A138; and V353 ( Figures 4 D and 4E). We found that Cα atoms of these residues were shifted toward the intracellular side in the Pres-Sal structure compared to the Pres-Cl structure by 1.5, 1.0, 1.7, and 2.0 Å, respectively. In the case of the extrinsic voltage sensor model, one would expect a movement of the anion-binding side toward the extracellular side in going from the contracted conformation at depolarized potentials to the expanded state at hyperpolarized potentials (( Rybalchenko and Santos-Sacchi, 2008 75. Rybalchenko, V. ∙ Santos-Sacchi, J. Anion control of voltage sensing by the motor protein prestin in outer hair cells Biophys. J. 2008; 95 :4439-4447 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar )). Furthermore, the valence of the charge movement parameter z in the two-state Boltzmann model used to fit NLC measurements (see STAR Methods ) is 0.64, indicating that, in case of a single moving charge with a valence of 1, one would expect it to move 0.64 times the span of the membrane (∼25 Å). Because we observe in our structures an opposite movement that is an order of magnitude shorter, our data are more consistent with the intrinsic voltage sensor model, where partial charges of multiple sidechains distributed within prestin move by smaller amounts so that the sum of these charge movements adds up to 0.64. Although we do observe charged residues moving perpendicular to the membrane ( Figures S5 F–H), we do not find a consistent pattern of charge movement that would explain the NLC, suggesting that changes in the polarization of the membrane causes additional conformational changes compared to the exchange of Cl − and salicylate.
Prestin is sensitive to changes in membrane tension ( Santos-Sacchi et al., 2001 82. Santos-Sacchi, J. ∙ Shen, W. ∙ Zheng, J. ... Effects of membrane potential and tension on prestin, the outer hair cell lateral membrane motor protein J. Physiol. 2001; 531 :661-666 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ; Santos-Sacchi and Tan, 2020 80. Santos-Sacchi, J. ∙ Tan, W. Complex nonlinear capacitance in outer hair cell macro-patches: effects of membrane tension Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :6222 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ) and thickness ( Fang et al., 2010 22. Fang, J. ∙ Izumi, C. ∙ Iwasa, K.H. Sensitivity of prestin-based membrane motor to membrane thickness Biophys. J. 2010; 98 :2831-2838 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as cholesterol concentration ( Kamar et al., 2012 47. Kamar, R.I. ∙ Organ-Darling, L.E. ∙ Raphael, R.M. Membrane cholesterol strongly influences confined diffusion of prestin Biophys. J. 2012; 103 :1627-1636 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). In investigating the interactions of lipids with our structures, we found that the resolved lipids were not arranged regularly in a plane perpendicular to the 2-fold axis ( Figures 5 A–5C and S4 C). At the lateral interface between the core and gate domains, lipid molecules were displaced toward the extracellular side. In contrast, lipids found between the TMDs of the two protomers were displaced toward the intracellular side. The deformation of the lipids from a plane is also mirrored in the estimated lipophilicity of the surface of prestin and causes a “saddle”-shaped micelle and nanodisc density ( Methods S1 ). The distance along the 2-fold axis between lipids displaced the furthest toward the extracellular or cytosolic side is around 15 Å.
To more closely examine how insertion of prestin into a lipid bilayer would deform the surrounding membrane and quantify the effect, we analyzed two 1.5-μs-long MD simulation trajectories of membrane-embedded prestin in the Cl − -bound conformation ( Figures 5 D and 5E). For the equilibrated protein-membrane system, the lipids in the outer leaflet are found to be “depressed” in the area between the TMDs by ∼7.5 Å (relative to the bulk average height of lipids) and “elevated” at the lateral gate and core interface by ∼7.5 Å ( Figure 5 E), resulting in an overall ∼15-Å deformation of lipids at the protein interface ( Figures 5 A and 5E). At the cytoplasmic leaflet, lipids at the lateral core-gate domain interface are similarly moved toward the extracellular side by ∼7.5 Å ( Figure 5 D). Together, these results suggest that prestin profoundly alters the shape of its surrounding lipid bilayer. The membrane deformation is reminiscent of the mechano-gated piezo channels ( Ge et al., 2015 26. Ge, J. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Zhao, Q. ... Architecture of the mammalian mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel Nature. 2015; 527 :64-69 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guo and MacKinnon, 2017 33. Guo, Y.R. ∙ MacKinnon, R. Structure-based membrane dome mechanism for Piezo mechanosensitivity eLife. 2017; 6 :e33660 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saotome et al., 2018 85. Saotome, K. ∙ Murthy, S.E. ∙ Kefauver, J.M. ... Structure of the mechanically activated ion channel Piezo1 Nature. 2018; 554 :481-486 Crossref Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ), although smaller in scale. It has been proposed that, in piezo channels, “flattening” of the membrane due to membrane tension stabilizes the open state ( Guo and MacKinnon, 2017 33. Guo, Y.R. ∙ MacKinnon, R. Structure-based membrane dome mechanism for Piezo mechanosensitivity eLife. 2017; 6 :e33660 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). In prestin, increasing membrane tension shifts the V h in the positive direction ( Santos-Sacchi et al., 2001 82. Santos-Sacchi, J. ∙ Shen, W. ∙ Zheng, J. ... Effects of membrane potential and tension on prestin, the outer hair cell lateral membrane motor protein J. Physiol. 2001; 531 :661-666 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ; Santos-Sacchi and Tan, 2020 80. Santos-Sacchi, J. ∙ Tan, W. Complex nonlinear capacitance in outer hair cell macro-patches: effects of membrane tension Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :6222 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could be explained by selective stabilization of the expanded state due to membrane “flattening.”
Binding of anions to a binding pocket within the TMD of each prestin protomer modulates the conformation of the TMD ( Figure 6 ). In the absence of Cl − and in the presence of salicylate, a rigid-body motion between core and gate domains results in a swelling of the TMD, consistent with the “area-motor” model ( Iwasa, 1994 42. Iwasa, K.H. A membrane motor model for the fast motility of the outer hair cell J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1994; 96 :2216-2224 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesize that the conformational changes between the contracted and expanded states, visualized here, provide important clues to the motions of prestin evoked by changes in membrane potential. To our knowledge, this is a previously unseen mechanism for a molecular motor and provides a structural framework for the transduction of electrical signals into mechanical motion. The fact that prestin is contracted in the presence of Cl − and that the anion-binding site moves toward the intracellular side in the expanded state rules out Cl − as an extrinsic voltage sensor. More likely, multiple charged residues previously identified as involved in NLC function and shown here to be distributed at the intracellular and extracellular membrane interfaces form an intrinsic voltage sensor, whose movement produces the NLC. Our structures indicate that salicylate inhibits eM by displacing Cl − from the anion-binding site and by preventing the structural transitions to the contracted state. An unexpected finding of profound membrane distortion by the prestin dimer, together with specifically bound cholesterol molecules between the TMDs, raises the importance of lipid interactions for prestin function and provides a structural rationale for the influence of cholesterol, membrane tension, and membrane thickness on prestin function.
Our work provides a structural framework for understanding the overall structure of prestin, its organization within the lipid bilayer, and the anion binding sites and conformational changes resulting from anion binding. Nevertheless, the employed techniques and systems have limitations associated with them. The contracted and expanded states of prestin captured in this study may not represent the full range of conformational states sampled by prestin while it is “working” in its native membrane environment and in the presence of transmembrane potentials. The structures reported here have been determined from prestin molecules solubilized by detergent and derived from a heterologous expression system. Therefore, the reconstructions and structures do not capture interactions with other proteins in OHCs or with native lipids. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to examine the stability and energetics of the bound anions and ligands and the configuration of the lipids around different prestin’s conformational states. MD simulations, as used here, are limited due to their classical nature of the force field and the limited timescale. Although the current study demonstrates that prestin specifically interacts with surrounding lipids, deforms the membrane bilayer, and propagates the conformational changes to the surrounding membrane, the specific native lipids that interact with prestin and how prestin conformational changes are actually transduced throughout the native cellular membrane remain elusive. Approaches that allow structure determination in situ , under specific transmembrane potentials, could answer these questions. Lastly, the current study does not answer the question of whether prestin transports ions. The structures of prestin, in addition to additional SLC26 transporter structures, will inform future mutagenesis and biophysical studies to answer this important question.

The gene encoding full-length human prestin (Uniprot ID: P58743-1) was synthesized and subcloned into the pEG BacMam vector ( Goehring et al., 2014 29. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). The construct contains a C-terminal 3C protease cleavage site, an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), and a StrepII tag. Sf9 cells (ThermoFisher 12659017) were used for BacMam virus amplification and were cultured in Sf-900 III SFM medium at 27°C. To express prestin for structural studies and functional analysis, HEK293 GnTI - cells were cultured in suspension using FreeStyle medium supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37°C. Both cell lines are routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination using CELLshipper Mycoplasma Detection Kit M-100 from Bionique and are mycoplasma free. No misidentified cell lines were used.
HEK293 GnTI - cells cultured at 37°C with a density of ∼2.5 × 10 6 ml - were infected with prestin BacMam virus at an MOI of 1:1. A final concentration of 10 mM sodium butyrate was added 12 hours after infection, and cells were cultured at 37°C for another 48 hours. Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2% (w/v) digitonin, and protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μM aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 2 μM pepstatin A) for three hours at 4°C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 186,009 g for one hour. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 um filter and incubated with Strep-Tactin resin, washed with 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) glycol-diosgenin (GDN), 0.004% (w/v) CHS, and eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM desthiobiotin. The eluate was concentrated and treated with 1:100 (w/w) 3C protease to remove the C-terminal GFP for 2 hours at 4°C. For prestin bound with Cl - (Pres-Cl), the concentrate was loaded onto a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column (Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL) equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% GDN. For prestin in the presence of sulfate and the absence of Cl - (Pres-sulfate), an SEC buffer containing 20 mM Tris sulfate pH 8.0, 60 mM Na 2 SO 4 , 0.02% GDN was used to replace Cl - . Peak fractions from both conditions were pooled and concentrated for cryo-EM grid preparation. For the salicylate-bound state (Pres-Sal), the concentrated Pres-sulfate sample was incubated with a final concentration of 10 mM sodium salicylate for 10 minutes before cryo-EM grid preparation.
For prestin in lipid nanodisc (Pres-Cl-nanodisc), porcine brain total lipid extract was dissolved in chloroform, dried in a rotary evaporator, and kept in a vacuum chamber overnight. The lipids were rehydrated to a final concentration of 20 mM with buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl by several freeze-thaw cycles. MSP1E3D1 scaffolding protein, which yields nanodiscs with an estimated outer membrane diameter of ∼12 nm, was purified as previously described ( Alvarez et al., 2010 3. Alvarez, F.J.D. ∙ Orelle, C. ∙ Davidson, A.L. Functional reconstitution of an ABC transporter in nanodiscs for use in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 :9513-9515 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lipid suspension was dissolved with a final concentration of 1% (w/v) GDN and 0.2% (w/v) CHS for 30 min and then incubated with prestin and MSP1E3D1 for 1 hour with a molar ratio of 1:5:600 (prestin dimer: MSP: lipid). Three batches of biobeads were added for detergent removal and nanodisc formation at 4°C, with the first two batches incubating for 2 hours and the last one overnight. For proteolysis, 3C protease (1:100 w/w) was combined with the last batch of biobeads to remove the GFP. The material was further purified by SEC (Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column) with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions were harvested and concentrated for cryo-EM grid preparation.
Aliquots of prestin (3.5 ul at ∼3 mg/ml) in either detergent micelles or lipid nanodiscs were applied onto Quantifoil holey carbon grids (R2/2, 200 mesh, gold) that had been glow discharged at 15 mA for 60 s. The grids were blotted with a Vitrobot mark IV at 100% humidity using a blotting time of 4 s and a blotting force of 0 at 8°C. The grids were plunge-frozen into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen.
Micrographs were collected on 300 kV Titan Krios electron microscopes equipped with an energy filter and a Gatan K3 camera. SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 57. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3221) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for automated data collection. Data collection for all datasets followed a similar strategy with a total dose of 50 e - /Å, 50 frames, and a defocus range of −0.8 to −2.5 μm. The Pres-Cl and Pres-Cl-nanodisc datasets were collected with a dose rate of 18 e/pix/s and a pixel size of 0.651 Å/pixel without the correlated double sampling (CDS) mode. The Pres-Sal and Pres-sulfate datasets were collected with the CDS mode, a dose rate of 4.5 e/pix/s, and a pixel size of 0.676 Å/pixel. The data collection statistics are summarized in Table S1 .
Raw micrographs in super-resolution mode were binned by 2x and corrected for both full-frame and local motion with the patch motion correction in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 70. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015 73. Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Brubaker, M.A. Alignment of cryo-EM movies of individual particles by optimization of image translations J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :188-195 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated with patch CTF estimation in cryoSPARC. Particles were initially picked from a small fraction of the Pres-Cl dataset with Gaussian blob picking and subjected to 2D classification. Class averages showing reasonable prestin features in various orientations were selected as templates for template-based particle picking. Particles from these class averages generated an ab initio model in cryoSPARC. For each full dataset, extracted particles were down-sampled by two times to either 1.301 Å (Pres-Cl and Pres-Cl-nanodisc) or 1.352 Å (Pres-Sal or Pres-sulfate), followed by one round of 2D classification to remove ‘junk’ particles.
For the Pres-Cl dataset, 3D classification into eight classes with the ab initio model as a reference was performed using either C1 or C2 symmetry. Both symmetries resulted in one good class out of eight with apparent C2 symmetry, indistinguishable structural features, and similar particle distribution. Therefore, C2 symmetry was used for subsequent image processing. 3D refinement with the bin-2 particles from the single good class resulted in a reconstruction at an overall resolution of 2.71 Å. Particles were re-extracted with the bin-1 pixel size of 0.651 Å and a box size of 512 pixels. 3D refinement with the re-extracted particles resulted in a reconstruction at 2.46 Å resolution. One more round of 3D classification and multiple rounds of local CTF refinement and non-uniform (NU) refinement ( Punjani et al., 2019 71. Punjani, A. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Fleet, D.J. Non-uniform refinement: adaptive regularization improves single particle cryo-EM reconstruction BioRXiv. 2019; Google Scholar ) were performed using cryoSPARC, improving the resolution to 2.34 Å. The particle stack was further subjected to one round of 3D classification without alignment in RELION 3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 102. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ) and reconstructed using NU refinement in cryoSPARC, resulting in a 2.31 Å resolution reconstruction. Detailed data processing of Pres-Cl dataset can be found in Methods S1 A.
For Pres-Cl-nanodisc and Pres-Sal datasets, the same data processing strategies were used except that no 3D classification step in RELION was performed, resulting in reconstructions at resolutions of 2.70 Å and 3.43 Å, respectively.
For the Pres-sulfate dataset, bin-2 (1.352 Å/pix) particles after 2D classification in cryoSPARC were exported to RELION 3.1 for global 3D classification into eight classes. One out of the eight classes had promising prestin features. Refinement of the single class resulted in a 7 Å resolution reconstruction in RELION 3.1. One round of local 3D classification followed by refinement of the best class further improved the resolution to 5.2 Å. After bin-1 (0.676 Å/pix) particles were re-extracted, a reconstruction at ∼5 Å resolution was obtained from RELION 3.1. The particles were moved to cryoSPARC for one round of homogeneous refinement and multiple rounds of local CTF refinement and NU refinement, improving the reconstruction to ∼4.3 Å. Detailed data processing of Pres-sulfate dataset can be found in Methods S1 B.
The 2.3 Å resolution cryo-EM map of Pres-Cl allows for de novo model building with high confidence in COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 21. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most regions are well resolved with clear side-chain features for residue registration. The N-terminal 1-11 residues and C-terminal 726-744 residues could not be built due to the lack of density in the map. We built ∼50 residues of the 80-residue long intervening sequence (IVS) region, which was previously considered unstructured and flexible. The first part of the IVS (residues 561-580) forms the Cα2 helix (residues 564-580). The second part of the IVS (residues 614-640) was built based on the unique side-chain features of residues 616-622 (YPPIVIK), which also helped to determine the loop orientation and the location of the remaining residues. In the extracellular loop region, where residues 162-166 were less well resolved, poly-alanines were built. Lipid-like densities were fitted with alkanes with various number of carbons. Solvent-like densities were modeled with water molecules that were automatically added by Phenix (version 1.19rc5-4047) ( Liebschner et al., 2019 50. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3360) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inspected in COOT. The model was refined in real space with Phenix (version 1.18.2-3874).
For model building of the other structures, the Pres-Cl structure without lipids and waters was fit into cryo-EM maps in ChimeraX ( Pettersen et al., 2021 67. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: structure visualization for researchers, educators, and developers Protein Sci. 2021; 30 :70-82 Crossref Scopus (3750) PubMed Google Scholar ) and adjusted in COOT. For Pres-Cl − Nanodisc, the Cl - was built similarly to Pres-Cl. For Pres-Sal, the salicylate was fit into the oval shape of density that appeared in a similar position as Cl - in Pres-Cl. The orientation of salicylate was determined by the density features, the surrounding residues and the molecular dynamics simulation. All final models were subjected to real-space refinement and validated in Phenix (version 1.18.2-3874). Map and structure figures were generated using Pymol or ChimeraX.
HEK293 GnTI - cells were transfected with the construct (pEG Bacmam CMV-hPrestin-GFP) for the cryo-EM studies and used for recordings 24-48 h after transfection. The recording pipettes had resistances of 2.5-3.5 MΩ when filled with the Cl - internal solution containing (in millimolar) 135 CsCl, 5 MgCl 2 , 2 Na 2 ATP, 10 HEPES and 10 EGTA or with the SO 4 2- internal solution containing (in millimolar) 88 Na 2 SO 4 , 2 MgSO 4 , 10 HEPES, 3 MgATP, and 10 EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.35).
Cells with a membrane resistance greater than 500 MΩ after rupturing were recorded in a bath filled with external solution containing (in millimolar) 120 NaCl, 2 CoCl 2 , 1 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 20 TEACl, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.35). Recordings were performed with Cl - internal buffer if not otherwise mentioned. For salicylate and 5-methylsalicylate inhibition experiments, 10 mM salicylate or 10 mM 5-methylsalicylate was added to the external solution. All solutions were adjusted to 310 ± 2 mOsm/L.
For NLC measurement with the “Sine+DC” method, HEK cells on coverslips were mounted on an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus) and viewed at 60x magnification using direct interference contrast (DIC). Transfected cells were identified using epifluorescence (Filter wavelength). Images were acquired with an ORCA Flash 4.0LT CMOS camera operated with CellSens software (Olympus). Lockin C m measurements were performed using an EPC10 amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA; Germany). Voltage-clamp C m recordings were done with a sinusoidal wave (2khz; 30mV peak-to peak) superimposed on holding potential (0 mV). Incremental voltage steps were given from −150mV (dV = 10mV; 200ms). C m traces were analyzed and plotted in IgorPro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego). C m was measured by averaging the last 150ms of each voltage step.
For NLC measurement with the dual-sine methodology, recordings were carried out at room temperature under the whole-cell patch clamp mode using an Axopatch 200A amplifier. Cells were placed in either external solution only or external solution supplemented with 10 mM salicylate (or salicylate analogs) for 2 min before each recording. Whole-cell capacitance was measured at 0 mV holding potential using a two sine wave voltage stimulus protocol (10 mV amplitude at both 390.6 and 781.2 Hz), followed by the fast Fourier transform-based admittance analysis using jClamp ( http://www.scisoftco.com ). Series resistance was compensated before recording and the residual was corrected with the built-in function in jClamp. The voltage-dependent capacitance was fit with the first derivative of the two-state Boltzmann function( Santos-Sacchi, 1991 77. Santos-Sacchi, J. Reversible inhibition of voltage-dependent outer hair cell motility and capacitance J.

Data are presented as means ± standard errors of means.
Cl - -, salicylate-, and sulfate-bound prestin cryo-EM structures were prepared for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations following the procedures described below. Missing side chains and hydrogen atoms were added to the experimental, cryo-EM models, using the PSFGEN plugin ( https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/psfgen/ ) in VMD ( Humphrey et al., 1996 40. Humphrey, W. ∙ Dalke, A. ∙ Schulten, K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 :33-38 Crossref Scopus (47182) PubMed Google Scholar ). The experimental models are missing a disordered region in the intracellular domain, dividing each protomer into two polypeptide segments (residues 13-580 and 614-724, respectively). Neutral N-terminal and C-terminal ‘caps’ were added to the first and last residues of each polypeptide segment, respectively, using PSFGEN. The coordinates of the bound Cl - and sulfate ions were based on the modeled Cl - in the cryo-EM structure, whereas the bound salicylate was placed in the binding pocket using our in-house docking protocol, GOLEM (see ‘Computational search for docking poses of salicylate’ for more details). Following pKa estimation by PROPKA ( Olsson et al., 2011 65. Olsson, M.H. ∙ Søndergaard, C.R. ∙ Rostkowski, M. ... PROPKA3: consistent treatment of internal and surface residues in empirical pKa predictions J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011; 7 :525-537 Crossref Scopus (2925) PubMed Google Scholar ; Søndergaard et al., 2011 88. Søndergaard, C.R. ∙ Olsson, M.H. ∙ Rostkowski, M. ... Improved treatment of ligands and coupling effects in empirical calculation and rationalization of pKa values J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011; 7 :2284-2295 Crossref Scopus (1329) PubMed Google Scholar ), all titratable residues were modeled in their default titration states, except for D653 in the transmembrane domain, which was modeled in its protonated (neutral) form. All protein structures were internally hydrated using the DOWSER ( Gumbart et al., 2009 31. Gumbart, J. ∙ Trabuco, L.G. ∙ Schreiner, E. ... Regulation of the protein-conducting channel by a bound ribosome Structure. 2009; 17 :1453-1464 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Hermans, 1996 97. Zhang, L. ∙ Hermans, J. Hydrophilicity of cavities in proteins Proteins. 1996; 24 :433-438 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ) plugin of VMD. The two cholesterol molecules modeled in the experimental structures were included in the Cl - - and salicylate-bound systems. The lipid bilayer used to embed the proteins was constructed in CHARMM-GUI ( Jo et al., 2008 43. Jo, S. ∙ Kim, T. ∙ Iyer, V.G. ... CHARMM-GUI: a web-based graphical user interface for CHARMM J. Comput. Chem. 2008; 29 :1859-1865 Crossref Scopus (4918) PubMed Google Scholar ). The orientation of the protein in the bilayer was obtained from the OPM (Orientations of Proteins in Membranes) database ( Lomize et al., 2006 53. Lomize, M.A. ∙ Lomize, A.L. ∙ Pogozheva, I.D. ... OPM: orientations of proteins in membranes database Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :623-625 Crossref Scopus (952) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protein, along with the bound cholesterol molecules, was then inserted into a heterogeneous lipid bilayer, followed by removing sterically clashing lipid molecules. The lipid bilayer is composed of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (POPC), palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (POPE), palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-glycerol (POPG), palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (POPI), palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (PSM), and cholesterol (CHOL) lipids at a molar ratio of 32:16:5:11:16:20. The protein-membrane system was then solvated with water including 150 mM NaCl in VMD (system size: 335k atoms). To further reduce any bias from the initial lipid configuration and increase the sampling, two independent membrane systems (with randomly placed initial lipids) were generated for Cl - -bound prestin.
The salicylate binding pose in our simulations was obtained using an in-house docking package called GOLEM ( Zhao and Tajkhorshid, 2021 99. Zhao, Z. ∙ Tajkhorshid, E. GOLEM: automated and robust cryo-EM-guided ligand docking with explicit water molecules Biophys. J. 2021; 120 :290a Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ). This software tool employs a genetic algorithm to explore a ligand’s conformational, orientational, and positional space, with explicit consideration of water displacement, as well as bridging water molecules’ position and orientation, to optimize the fitness, which is defined as the combination of the system’s energy and fitting to the cryo-EM electron density. Despite the stochasticity of the genetic part of the algorithm, given the large number of iterations, GOLEM robustly reproduces the ligand’s docked pose with negligible differences in repeated trials. The resulting docked pose can be further validated by equilibrium MD simulations, as done in this study.
All MD simulations were performed using NAMD simulation package ( Phillips et al., 2005 68. Phillips, J.C. ∙ Braun, R. ∙ Wang, W. ... Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26 :1781-1802 Crossref Scopus (14174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Phillips et al., 2020 69. Phillips, J.C. ∙ Hardy, D.J. ∙ Maia, J.D.C. ... Scalable molecular dynamics on CPU and GPU architectures with NAMD J. Chem. Phys. 2020; 153 :044130 Crossref Scopus (1552) PubMed Google Scholar ) and employing the fully atomistic CHARMM36m ( Huang et al., 2017 39. Huang, J. ∙ Rauscher, S. ∙ Nawrocki, G. ... CHARMM36m: an improved force field for folded and intrinsically disordered proteins Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :71-73 Crossref Scopus (3488) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CHARMM36 ( Klauda et al., 2010 48. Klauda, J.B. ∙ Venable, R.M. ∙ Freites, J.A. ... Update of the CHARMM all-atom additive force field for lipids: validation on six lipid types J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114 :7830-7843 Crossref Scopus (3283) PubMed Google Scholar ) force fields for the protein and lipids, respectively. The TIP3 model was used for water molecules ( Jorgensen et al., 1983 45. Jorgensen, W.L. ∙ Chandrasekhar, J. ∙ Madura, J.D. ... Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79 :926-935 Crossref Scopus (33510) Google Scholar ). The salicylate was parameterized using the CHARMM general force field (CGenFF) webserver ( https://cgenff.umaryland.edu ) ( Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010 94. Vanommeslaeghe, K. ∙ Hatcher, E. ∙ Acharya, C. ... CHARMM general force field: A force field for drug-like molecules compatible with the CHARMM all-atom additive biological force fields J. Comput. Chem. 2010; 31 :671-690 Crossref Scopus (5013) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2012 95. Vanommeslaeghe, K. ∙ Raman, E.P. ∙ MacKerell, Jr., A.D.

Model. 2012; 52 :3155-3168 Crossref Scopus (1202) PubMed Google Scholar ) and further optimized employing the Force Field Toolkit (ffTK) plugin ( Mayne et al., 2013 58. Mayne, C.G. ∙ Saam, J. ∙ Schulten, K. ... Rapid parameterization of small molecules using the Force Field Toolkit J. Comput. Chem. 2013; 34 :2757-2770 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ) of VMD. Sulfate parameters were adopted from a previous study employing ab initio calculations ( Cannon et al., 1994 12. Cannon, W.R. ∙ Pettitt, B.M. ∙ McCammon, J.A. Sulfate anion in water: model structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98 :6225-6230 Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar ). A 12 Å cutoff was used for short-range, non-bonded interactions, with switching starting at 10 Å. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm ( Darden et al., 1993 19. Darden, T. ∙ York, D. ∙ Pedersen, L. Particle mesh Ewald: an N ⋅ log ( N ) method for Ewald sums in large systems J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98 :10089-10092 Crossref Scopus (23957) Google Scholar ) with a grid density of 1 Å -1 , and a PME interpolation order of 6. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were kept rigid using the SHAKE algorithm ( Ryckaert et al., 1977 76. Ryckaert, J.-P. ∙ Ciccotti, G. ∙ Berendsen, H.J.C. Numerical integration of the cartesian equations of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of n-alkanes J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23 :327-341 Crossref Scopus (18418) Google Scholar ). Temperature was maintained at 310 K using Langevin thermostat with a damping coefficient of 1.0 ps -1 . Pressure was maintained at 1 atm by the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston barostat ( Feller et al., 1995 23. Feller, S.E. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Pastor, R.W. ... Constant pressure molecular dynamics simulation: the Langevin piston method J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103 :4613-4621 Crossref Scopus (3629) Google Scholar ; Martyna et al., 1994 56. Martyna, G.J. ∙ Tobias, D.J. ∙ Klein, M.L. Constant pressure molecular dynamics algorithms J. Chem. Phys. 1994; 101 :4177-4189 Crossref Scopus (4286) Google Scholar ), with period and decay of 100 and 50 fs, respectively. All systems were simulated in a flexible cell allowing the dimensions of the periodic cell to change independently while keeping the cell aspect ratio in the xy plane (membrane plane) constant. The simulation timestep was set to 2 fs. Lennard-Jones and PME forces were updated at one and two timesteps, respectively. Atomic coordinates were saved every 10 ps.
The two Cl - -bound systems were simulated following these steps: (1) 10,000 steps of energy minimization, followed by 5 ns MD equilibration, in which harmonic position restraints ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) were applied to the position of protein’s heavy atoms modeled in the cryo-EM structure, as well as to the heavy atoms of the two modeled cholesterol molecules and the bound Cl - ions. Furthermore, the z position (normal to the membrane plane) of phosphorus atoms in phospholipids and oxygen atoms of bulk cholesterols were also restrained in this step using a harmonic potential ( k = 5 kcal/mol/Å 2 ); (2) 20 ns of MD equilibration with only the protein backbone, heavy atoms of the two modeled cholesterol molecules, and the bound Cl - ions restrained harmonically ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ); (3) 5 ns of MD equilibration in which all the restraints from the previous step were gradually removed by decreasing the force constant stepwise from 10 to 0 kcal/mol/Å 2 ; (4) production MD equilibrium runs for 1.5 μs without any restraints.
The simulation of the salicylate-bound system was performed to check the stability of the computationally docked pose of the inhibitor, and therefore, followed a different protocol: (1) 10,000 steps of energy minimization, followed by 5 ns of MD equilibration with harmonic restraints ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) on all the protein’s heavy atoms modeled in the cryo-EM structure, and on the heavy atoms of the bound salicylates, water molecules placed close to the salicylates by the docking protocol (GOLEM), and the heavy atoms of the two modeled cholesterols. In addition, z positional restraints were applied ( k = 5 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) to phosphorus atoms of phospholipids and oxygen atoms of bulk cholesterols; (2) 20 ns of MD equilibration in which the only protein backbone heavy atoms were restrained ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ), while the salicylate and protein side chains were free to move; (3) a production MD run extending the simulation in Step 2 to 250 ns.
The simulation of sulfate-bound structure was conducted to obtain an equilibrated system for free energy perturbation (FEP) simulations used to calculate the binding affinity of sulfate in the binding pocket, and therefore, followed a shorter protocol: (1) 10,000 steps of energy minimization, followed by 5 ns of MD equilibration while applying harmonic position restraints ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) to the protein’s heavy atoms modeled in the cryo-EM structure, and to the modeled sulfate ions in the binding pockets. Furthermore, the z position of phosphorus atoms in phospholipids and oxygen atoms and cholesterols were also harmonically restrained ( k = 5 kcal/mol/Å 2 ); (2) 20 ns of MD equilibration with only the protein backbone and bound sulfate ions restrained harmonically ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ).
Two non-equilibrium MD simulations were performed to drive transitions between the contracted and expanded states and to monitor the response of the membrane to these transitions, one in the forward (contracted to expanded) and one in the backward (expanded to contracted) direction. The Cl - -bound cryo-EM structure represented the contracted state, while the salicylate-bound conformation was used to represent prestin in its expanded state. The same protocol as described in ‘ System preparation ’ was employed to construct the contracted and expanded systems. Since the goal was to investigate the coupling between the protein’s conformational transitions and the membrane, the bound Cl - and salicylate are not included in these simulations.
These transition simulations follow the same driving protocols (but in opposite directions): (1) 10,000 steps of energy minimization, followed by 5 ns of MD equilibration while restraining the protein’s heavy atoms modeled in the cryo-EM structure, as well as the heavy atoms of the two modeled cholesterol molecules, using a harmonic potential ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ). Moreover, harmonic z position restraints were applied to phosphorus atoms pf phospholipids and oxygen atoms of bulk cholesterols ( k = 5 kcal/mol/Å 2 ); (2) 20 ns of MD equilibration with harmonic restraints on the protein backbone, as well as on the heavy atoms of the two modeled cholesterol molecules ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ); (3) keeping the same restraints as in Step 2, but only on the protein backbone and further equilibrating the system for 150 ns; (4) a 50 ns non-equilibrium MD simulation, with time-dependent biases applied to drive the transition of the protein conformation from the initial to the target state using the Collective Variables (COLVARS) module of NAMD ( Fiorin et al., 2013 24. Fiorin, G. ∙ Klein, M.L. ∙ Hénin, J. Using collective variables to drive molecular dynamics simulations Mol. Phys. 2013; 111 :3345-3362 Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar ). The transition was achieved by applying biasing forces (k = 1.5 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) on the protein Cα atoms to decrease their RMSD with respect to those in the target structure; (5) maintaining the protein in the target state for additional 150 ns by applying the final set of biases (not moving this time) introduced in Step 3.
During the transitions between the contracted and expanded forms (the non-equilibrium phase of the simulations in Step 3), the x and y dimensions of the simulation box (membrane dimensions) were recorded every 10 ps. The resulting xy plane area reflects the total cross sectional area of the protein-membrane system.
Molecular images from MD trajectories are generated with VMD ( Humphrey et al., 1996 40. Humphrey, W. ∙ Dalke, A. ∙ Schulten, K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 :33-38 Crossref Scopus (47182) PubMed Google Scholar ). The membrane deformation induced by prestin is quantified by recording the z component of the center of mass of the lipids’ phosphate (PO 4 - ) groups during the last 500 ns of the Cl - -bound trajectories. The origin of the z axis is defined as the bilayer midplane. The resulting heatmap diagram (binned using 2 × 2 Å 2 bins) in each leaflet captures the spatial distribution of the height of the lipid head groups within the membrane.
The dynamics of the Cl - ions at their binding sites were monitored by measuring their displacement from the original (experimentally modeled) positions. When analyzing Cl - dynamics in each binding site, to average out the motion of the binding site itself, the trajectories were aligned using Cα atoms of the binding-site residues (Q97, F101, P136, F137, L397, S398, and R399) with respect to those in the cryo-EM structure. Then, the distance between the ion (either from the initial model or from the bulk solution) to the modeled Cl - in the cryo-EM structure was recorded. The distance plots were smoothed using a sliding window of 1 ns.
The stability of the docked salicylate in the two subunits was monitored by calculating the displacement and change in orientation of the ligand throughout the simulations. The displacement was obtained by calculating the center of mass displacement of salicylate from its docked pose in each frame of the trajectory. The orientational change was defined as the angular change of the normal vector to the salicylate’s benzene ring with respect to that of the docked pose. Both the displacement and orientation plots were smoothed using a sliding window of 0.2 ns.
Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) simulations ( Cournia et al., 2017 15. Cournia, Z. ∙ Allen, B. ∙ Sherman, W. Relative binding free energy calculations in drug discovery: recent advances and practical considerations J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2017; 57 :2911-2937 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ) were performed on the Cl - -, salicylate-, and sulfate-bound structures to compare relative binding affinities of the three ligands. During the employed FEP protocol, the ligand is annihilated from the anion binding pocket of one prestin protomer while created at a location in bulk solution 80 Å away from the binding pocket. The FEP calculations of Cl - -, salicylate-, and sulfate-bound structures were initiated from the last frame of Step 2 of the equilibration protocol (see Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations for more details). During FEP calculations, the protein backbone heavy atoms were restrained ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) to the corresponding experimentally modeled positions to avoid undesired structural deviations. All other simulation parameters were the same as in the aforementioned equilibrium simulations. The alchemical transformations were performed in both forward (λ increasing from 0 to 1; ligand annihilation in the binding site and creation in solution) and backward (λ decreasing from 1 to 0; ligand creation in the binding site and annihilation in solution) directions to assess the reversibility. A soft-core van der Waals (vdW) radius-shifting coefficient of 5 Å was chosen. In the forward transformation, the vdW and electrostatic interactions of the annihilated particles were linearly decoupled over a λ range of 0-1 and 0-0.5, respectively; in the backward transformation these interactions were linearly coupled in the corresponding λ ranges. Each FEP calculation was divided into 50 equally-spaced consecutive windows along the λ reaction coordinate to ensure gradual transformation. Within each window, the performed simulation consisted of 5,000 steps of energy minimization, an initial equilibration phase of 100 ps, followed by 1 ns MD simulation for data collection, with the data saved every 20 fs, resulting in a cumulative FEP simulation time of 110 ns for each system. To prevent the dissociation of the ligand during the alchemical transformation, harmonic restraints were applied to the annihilated and created ligands ( k = 10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ). All the simulations were performed, employing the FEP module of NAMD ( Chen et al., 2020 13. Chen, H. ∙ Maia, J.D.C. ∙ Radak, B.K. ... Boosting free-energy perturbation calculations with GPU-accelerated NAMD J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2020; 60 :5301-5307 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). The outputs were analyzed using the ParseFEP ( Liu et al., 2012 51. Liu, P. ∙ Dehez, F. ∙ Cai, W. ... A toolkit for the analysis of free-energy perturbation calculations J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2012; 8 :2606-2616 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ) plugin in VMD, with the statistical error estimated using the implemented Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method ( Bennett, 1976 10. Bennett, C.H. Efficient estimation of free energy differences from Monte Carlo data J. Comput. Phys. 1976; 22 :245-268 Crossref Scopus (2248) Google Scholar ).
The resolution of the cryo-EM maps was estimated by the FSC = 0.143 criterion, calculated from both half maps with a soft solvent mask in cryoSPARC. The angular distribution of particles was plotted with the python script star2bild.py in the UCSF pyem package ( Asarnow et al., 2019 5. Asarnow, D. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Cheng, Y. UCSF pyem v0.5. Zenodo 2019 https://www.doi.org/ Crossref Google Scholar ). The local resolution was calculated in cryoSPARC. Detailed data processing statistics and map quantifications are listed in Table S1 and Figure S2 .
