Title: Single-Molecule Imaging Reveals Translation of mRNAs Localized to Stress Granules


Abstract: Summary

Cellular stress leads to reprogramming of mRNA translation and formation of stress granules (SGs), membraneless organelles consisting of mRNA and RNA-binding proteins. Although the function of SGs remains largely unknown, it is widely assumed they contain exclusively non-translating mRNA. Here, we re-examine this hypothesis using single-molecule imaging of mRNA translation in living cells. Although we observe non-translating mRNAs are preferentially recruited to SGs, we find unequivocal evidence that mRNAs localized to SGs can undergo translation. Our data indicate that SG-associated translation is not rare, and the entire translation cycle (initiation, elongation, and termination) can occur on SG-localized transcripts. Furthermore, translating mRNAs can be observed transitioning between the cytosol and SGs without changing their translational status. Together, these results demonstrate that mRNA localization to SGs is compatible with translation and argue against a direct role for SGs in inhibition of protein synthesis.

Section: Introduction

Cells are often exposed to stress conditions such as oxidative stress, temperature changes, viral infection, or presence of toxins. To protect against these unfavorable conditions and minimize the damage during stress, cells activate an evolutionarily conserved pathway termed the integrated stress response ( Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016 52. Pakos-Zebrucka, K. ∙ Koryga, I. ∙ Mnich, K. ... The integrated stress response EMBO Rep. 2016; 17 :1374-1395 Crossref Scopus (1475) PubMed Google Scholar ). This pathway triggers the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α, leading to inhibition of translation of most mRNAs. This translational repression allows cells to conserve energy and shift their resources toward the restoration of cellular homeostasis ( Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016 52. Pakos-Zebrucka, K. ∙ Koryga, I. ∙ Mnich, K. ... The integrated stress response EMBO Rep. 2016; 17 :1374-1395 Crossref Scopus (1475) PubMed Google Scholar ). Along with the reprogramming of translation, the integrated stress response also leads to the assembly of stress granules (SGs), phase-separated membraneless organelles, in the cytoplasm. A fraction of cytoplasmic mRNAs localize to SGs upon their assembly, and translation inhibition and RNA length have been shown to correlate with SG association ( Khong et al., 2017 37. Khong, A. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :808-820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to mRNAs, SGs are enriched in RNA-binding proteins and translation initiation factors ( Nunes et al., 2019 49. Nunes, C. ∙ Mestre, I. ∙ Marcelo, A. ... MSGP: the first database of the protein components of the mammalian stress granules Database (Oxford). 2019; 2019 :baz031 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). There has been significant effort toward understanding SG composition, material properties, and role in diseases, however, their biological function remains largely unknown ( Alberti and Dormann, 2019 2.

Recent studies using single-molecule imaging techniques in living cells have begun to shed light on the kinetics of mRNA recruitment to SGs ( Moon et al., 2019 43. Moon, S.L. ∙ Morisaki, T. ∙ Khong, A. ... Multicolour single-molecule tracking of mRNA interactions with RNP granules Nat.

Despite this progress, we know little about the functional consequence of these interactions, as it remains unclear whether sequestration of mRNAs to SGs has any impact on gene expression ( Guzikowski et al., 2019 24. Guzikowski, A.R. ∙ Chen, Y.S. ∙ Zid, B.M. Stress-induced mRNP granules: Form and function of processing bodies and stress granules Wiley Interdiscip. Rev.

Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :946-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because SG formation coincides with global silencing of translation, it is often speculated that SGs are directly contributing to this repression during stress ( Adjibade et al., 2015 1. Adjibade, P. ∙ St-Sauveur, V.G. ∙ Quevillon Huberdeau, M. ...

Translational control of aberrant stress responses as a hallmark of cancer J. Pathol. 2018; 244 :650-666 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). This stems from the assumption that SGs contain exclusively non-translating mRNA and help to keep them in an inhibited state. There is, however, little direct evidence supporting this model because single-molecule methods for measuring the translation and location of transcripts within individual cells have only recently been described ( Halstead et al., 2015 25.

Dynamics of Translation of Single mRNA Molecules In Vivo Cell. 2016; 165 :976-989 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, previous studies have characterized transcripts that are translationally inhibited during stress, making it difficult to disentangle the specific contribution of SGs to this process ( Moon et al., 2019 43. Moon, S.L. ∙ Morisaki, T. ∙ Khong, A. ... Multicolour single-molecule tracking of mRNA interactions with RNP granules Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :162-168 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilbertz et al., 2019 70. Wilbertz, J.H. ∙ Voigt, F. ∙ Horvathova, I. ... Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :946-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although most transcripts are repressed during stress, there are transcripts such as ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) that are necessary for mounting the stress response and are preferentially translated when eIF2ɑ is phosphorylated ( Harding et al., 2000 26. Harding, H.P. ∙ Novoa, I. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... Regulated translation initiation controls stress-induced gene expression in mammalian cells Mol. Cell. 2000; 6 :1099-1108 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2567) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to characterize the relationship between translational status and SG recruitment of mRNAs during stress, we generated ATF4-SunTag reporter transcripts for single-molecule imaging of translation in living cells. Using this approach, we find direct evidence that mRNAs localized to SGs can undergo translation. ATF4-SunTag transcripts localized to SGs can initiate translation, elongate, and terminate, indicating that the SG environment does not repress any step of the translation cycle. Translating mRNAs can also be observed to dynamically exchange between the cytosol and SGs. Additionally, we show that SG-associated translation is not limited to transcripts whose translation is enhanced during stress because our measurements are sensitive enough to also detect SG-associated translation for transcripts that are inhibited during stress. Because membraneless organelles are now proposed to play a key role in cellular compartmentalization, these experiments highlight the importance of direct observation of biochemical reactions inside and outside of biomolecular condensates in order to understand their biological function.

Section: Results

In order to characterize the relationship between mRNA localization and translation during stress, we combined live-cell imaging of SGs with SunTag-based single-molecule imaging of translation ( Pichon et al., 2016 54. Pichon, X. ∙ Bastide, A. ∙ Safieddine, A. ... Visualization of single endogenous polysomes reveals the dynamics of translation in live human cells J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214 :769-781 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2016 67. Wang, C. ∙ Han, B. ∙ Zhou, R. ... Real-Time Imaging of Translation on Single mRNA Transcripts in Live Cells Cell. 2016; 165 :990-1001 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2016 72. Wu, B. ∙ Eliscovich, C. ∙ Yoon, Y.J. ... Translation dynamics of single mRNAs in live cells and neurons Science. 2016; 352 :1430-1435 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2016 73. Yan, X. ∙ Hoek, T.A. ∙ Vale, R.D. ... Dynamics of Translation of Single mRNA Molecules In Vivo Cell. 2016; 165 :976-989 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). This approach allows visualization of individual reporter mRNAs via MS2 stem-loops and simultaneous visualization of nascent peptide chains via the SunTag, which consists of an array of antibody epitopes that are recognized by genetically encoded single-chain antibodies (scFv). To accomplish this, we engineered a HeLa cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged scFv and Halo-tagged MS2 coat protein (MCP) ( Voigt et al., 2017 65. Voigt, F. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Cui, X.A. ... Single-Molecule Quantification of Translation-Dependent Association of mRNAs with the Endoplasmic Reticulum Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3740-3753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reporter mRNA encodes the SunTag array in frame with Renilla luciferase, enabling the measurement of protein synthesis by two complementary assays. The reporter mRNA further contains a destabilized FKBP domain to enhance the degradation of the mature protein, thereby facilitating imaging of nascent peptide chains during translation ( Banaszynski et al., 2006 7. Banaszynski, L.A. ∙ Chen, L.-C. ∙ Maynard-Smith, L.A. ... A rapid, reversible, and tunable method to regulate protein function in living cells using synthetic small molecules Cell. 2006; 126 :995-1004 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ). To enable visualization of translation during stress, we placed the 5′UTR of ATF4 in front of the SunTag array ( Figure 1 A). This enables the mRNA to be efficiently translated during stress conditions when most other mRNAs are inhibited. The reporter mRNA was integrated into the genome at a site-specific locus and was under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter, which enables precise mRNA tracking and minimizes potential artifacts of overexpression. Using luciferase assays, we confirmed that translation of this ATF4-SunTag reporter is specifically upregulated during arsenite stress compared to normal growth conditions ( Figure 1 B), as previously reported for endogenous ATF4 ( Andreev et al., 2015 5. Andreev, D.E. ∙ O’Connor, P.B.F. ∙ Fahey, C. ... Translation of 5′ leaders is pervasive in genes resistant to eIF2 repression eLife. 2015; 4 :e03971 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roybal et al., 2005 56. Roybal, C.N. ∙ Hunsaker, L.A. ∙ Barbash, O. ... The oxidative stressor arsenite activates vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA transcription by an ATF4-dependent mechanism J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :20331-20339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, ATF4-SunTag was efficiently translated at an oxidative stress condition (100 μM arsenite) that also triggered robust SG formation in all cells ( Figure 1 B), thus enabling us to visualize the translation of this mRNA in SG-containing cells. It should be noted that at higher arsenite concentrations, ATF4-SunTag translation was inhibited.
Because ATF4 translation is enhanced during stress, it is interesting that it has been previously reported that the chemotherapeutic drug sorafenib, which triggers the integrated stress response, results in accumulation of ATF4 mRNA in SGs ( Adjibade et al., 2015 1. Adjibade, P. ∙ St-Sauveur, V.G. ∙ Quevillon Huberdeau, M. ... Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, induces formation of stress granules in hepatocarcinoma cells Oncotarget. 2015; 6 :43927-43943 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). This paradoxical finding was interpreted as a means to buffer ATF4 translation during stress by sequestration and translational repression in SGs. Using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with immunofluorescence, we confirmed that endogenous ATF4 mRNAs as well as ATF4-Suntag transcripts accumulate in SGs also during oxidative stress ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Next, to label SGs in living cells, we introduced SNAP-tag-labeled G3BP1 to our cell line and confirmed that G3BP1-SNAP forms SGs only during stress and colocalizes with other SG components such as endogenous TIA-1 ( Figure S1 C). We then performed live-cell imaging of this cell line exposed to oxidative stress and observed that ATF4-SunTag mRNAs are frequently recruited to SGs as described for other mRNAs that are translationally inhibited ( Moon et al., 2019 43. Moon, S.L. ∙ Morisaki, T. ∙ Khong, A. ... Multicolour single-molecule tracking of mRNA interactions with RNP granules Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :162-168 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilbertz et al., 2019 70. Wilbertz, J.H. ∙ Voigt, F. ∙ Horvathova, I. ... Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :946-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). SG-localized mRNAs can be clearly distinguished from cytosolic mRNAs, because they colocalize with G3BP1-labeled SGs and are much less mobile compared to freely moving cytosolic mRNAs ( Video S1 ). Translating and non-translating mRNAs can be distinguished by the presence of the SunTag signal. As expected, we often observe non-translating mRNA localized to SGs ( Figure S1 D). Surprisingly, we also observe that translating ATF4-SunTag mRNAs are frequently localized to SGs ( Figure 1 C; Video S1 ), suggesting that localization to SGs does not require inhibition of mRNA translation. Because SG-localized mRNAs are more static than cytosolic transcripts, we were able to follow them in longer time-lapse imaging experiments that revealed translating mRNAs often remain localized to SGs for more than 5 min ( Figure 1 D; Video S2 ).

Translating mRNAs Localized to SGs, Related to Figure 1 Example of SG-associated translation in cells treated with 100 μM sodium arsenite for 1 h and imaged with 0.5 s intervals. Arrows indicate ATF4-SunTag mRNAs labeled with SunTag signal and localized to SGs.
Considering that we observe both non-translating and translating mRNAs in SGs as well as in the cytosol, we set out to quantify whether there is any correlation between translational status and localization to SGs. To this end, we developed an image analysis workflow enabling us to assign translation status and localization to thousands of ATF4-SunTag mRNAs. Specifically, we determined the translation status of mRNAs using single-particle tracking of MS2 and SunTag foci followed by pairwise colocalization analysis of the trajectories. The localization to SGs was determined by measuring the G3BP1 signal at the mRNA coordinates and in the cytoplasm ( Figures S2 A–S2D; STAR Methods ). As expected, SG-localized mRNA tracks showed dramatically reduced mobility regardless of translation status ( Figures S2 E and S2F), demonstrating these mRNAs are stably bound to the stress granule. The analysis revealed substantial cell-to-cell variability in the fraction of mRNAs undergoing translation. On average, 30% of SG-localized ATF4-SunTag mRNAs were found to co-localize with SunTag signal, indicating that SG-associated translation is not a rare event for this type of transcript ( Figure 2 A). Cytosolic mRNAs had a slightly higher percentage of translating mRNAs (44% of mRNAs). After addition of the translational inhibitor puromycin, virtually all mRNAs (both cytosolic and SG-localized) are devoid of SunTag signal, demonstrating that our analysis is stringent and SunTag-labeled mRNAs represent bona fide translation sites ( Figure 2 A). Importantly, SG-localized and cytosolic mRNAs did not dramatically differ in their SunTag signal intensities ( Figure 2 B). As SunTag intensity correlates with the number of ribosomes, this indicates that ribosome occupancy on translating mRNAs is similar in the cytosol and SGs.
To further examine how mRNAs are distributed based on their translational status, we divided all ATF4-SunTag mRNAs into translating and non-translating populations and quantified their distribution in SGs and the cytosol. For both translating and non-translating transcripts, only a small percentage of these two populations were localized to SGs (translating: 12%, non-translating: 19%), whereas the majority of both types of transcripts remained in the cytosol ( Figure 2 C and 2D). The slight enrichment of non-translating mRNAs in SGs can have two possible explanations. One possibility is that the localization to SGs reduces the translation activity of mRNAs. The second explanation is that the ribosome occupancy of mRNAs influences the partitioning between cytosol and SG. To test this, we compared the extent of mRNA localization to SGs between arsenite-treated cells and cells co-treated with puromycin. This analysis revealed that puromycin-treated cells have a significantly higher fraction of SG-localized mRNAs (36% versus 16%), indicating that non-translating mRNAs are more likely to be recruited to SGs ( Figure 2 E). This strongly suggests that the observed correlation between localization to SGs and slightly lower translation activity can be explained by the higher propensity of non-translating mRNAs to localize to SGs. As the majority of mRNAs are translationally repressed during stress, this may explain the difficulty in separating SG localization from translation inhibition.
It has been reported that SGs are not homogeneous and contain substructures. In particular, several studies support a model where SGs contain stable cores surrounded by a more dynamic shell ( Cirillo et al., 2020 14. Cirillo, L. ∙ Cieren, A. ∙ Barbieri, S. ...

ATPase-Modulated Stress Granules Contain a Diverse Proteome and Substructure Cell. 2016; 164 :487-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1024) PubMed Google Scholar ; Niewidok et al., 2018 48. Niewidok, B. ∙ Igaev, M. ∙ Pereira da Graca, A. ... Single-molecule imaging reveals dynamic biphasic partition of RNA-binding proteins in stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :1303-1318 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been recently demonstrated that mRNAs often localize to the surface of SGs ( Moon et al., 2019 43. Moon, S.L. ∙ Morisaki, T. ∙ Khong, A. ... Multicolour single-molecule tracking of mRNA interactions with RNP granules Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :162-168 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previously, it was also shown that gurken transcripts in Drosophila embryos are translated on the outside edge of P-bodies, another type of membraneless organelle, but not within them ( Davidson et al., 2016 16. Davidson, A. ∙ Parton, R.M. ∙ Rabouille, C. ... Localized Translation of gurken/TGF-α mRNA during Axis Specification Is Controlled by Access to Orb/CPEB on Processing Bodies Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :2451-2462 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we set out to determine if the translational status of mRNAs was related to their position within a SG. To this aim, we performed a 3D spot detection and SG segmentation in fixed cells and measured the distances from each ATF4-SunTag mRNA in SGs to the closest SG boundary. It should be noted that SG boundaries are not precisely defined, and it has been shown that some SG components, such as eIF4A, can extend beyond the boundary defined by G3BP1 ( Tauber et al., 2020 61. Tauber, D. ∙ Tauber, G. ∙ Khong, A. ... Modulation of RNA Condensation by the DEAD-Box Protein eIF4A Cell. 2020; 180 :411-426 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, our measurement of the distance from the boundary could be an underestimate. The analysis revealed that the majority of translating (76%) and non-translating (65%) mRNAs in SGs are located within 0.3 μm of the detected SG boundary, with a slight bias for translating mRNAs to be closer to the surface (mean distance ± SD: 0.22 ± 0.16 μm versus 0.27 ± 0.18 μm) ( Figure 3 A). Translating mRNAs, however, could also be detected deeper inside SGs and were observed up to 1 μm from the boundary in larger SGs ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Importantly, the distance from the SG boundary did not correlate with SunTag intensity of the translating mRNAs ( Figure 3 C). This indicates that translational status is not the major determinant of the position of mRNAs within SGs and confirms previous observations that many mRNAs localize to the outer layers of SGs.
Although our experiments demonstrate that mRNAs that are bound by ribosomes with nascent polypeptides can be localized to SGs, it remained a possibility that these transcripts were translationally stalled ( Moon et al., 2020 44. Moon, S.L. ∙ Morisaki, T. ∙ Stasevich, T.J. ... Coupling of translation quality control and mRNA targeting to stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219 :e202004120 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to determine if SG-localized mRNAs are actively translated, we acquired longer movies and identified events where the SunTag signal increased over time on SG-localized mRNAs that were initially devoid of SunTag signal ( Figure 4 A; Video S3 ). These transcripts indicated that mRNAs can also initiate translation when localized to SGs.

Long-Lasting Localization of Translating mRNA to SG, Related to Figure 1 Examples of long-lasting localization of SunTag-positive ATF4-SunTag mRNA to SG (arrow). Cells were treated with 100 μM sodium arsenite for 1 h, time-lapse movies were acquired with 10 s intervals and Z stack acquisition.
In order to quantify the kinetics of translation of transcripts localized to SGs, we measured the increase in SunTag signal intensity on the newly translated SG-localized mRNAs in longer time-lapse movies ( Figures 4 A and 4B). The increase was not due to movement of the mRNA into the focal plane, because the MCP-Halo signal did not increase over time ( Figure S3 A). This quantification revealed the increase in SunTag intensity was followed by a plateau phase ( Figure 4 B). A similar observation has been previously reported for membrane-tethered mRNAs and can be explained by a steady state where the newly synthesized SunTag is compensated by ribosomes terminating translation ( Ruijtenberg et al., 2020 58.

Assuming that the initiation rate remains relatively constant after the mRNA starts being translated, the transition between the increasing phase and the plateau phase marks the first ribosome terminating translation ( Ruijtenberg et al., 2020 58. Ruijtenberg, S. ∙ Sonneveld, S. ∙ Cui, T.J. ... mRNA structural dynamics shape Argonaute-target interactions Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :790-801 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Measuring the duration of the increasing phase thus allows us to estimate the rate of translation elongation on SG-localized mRNAs. Fitting the SunTag fluorescence intensity curves with a three-part (constant-linear-constant) model determined the duration of the increasing phase to be 247 ± 36 s (mean ± SEM), which corresponds to an elongation rate of 3.8 ± 0.6 codons/s. This is comparable to the elongation rates 3–5 codons/s measured previously by single-molecule imaging of different SunTag mRNA reporters ( Wang et al., 2016 67. Wang, C. ∙ Han, B. ∙ Zhou, R. ...

Dynamics of Translation of Single mRNA Molecules In Vivo Cell. 2016; 165 :976-989 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ), all of which were performed in the absence of stress.
It was not possible to perform the same analysis on cytosolic mRNAs due to their rapid movement ( Figures S2 E and S2F). To acquire sufficiently long movies of mRNAs not localized to SGs, we immobilized mRNAs by anchoring them to the actin cytoskeleton via a modified MCP system ( Bhaskar et al., 2020 10. Bhaskar, V. ∙ Jia, M. ∙ Chao, J.A. A Single-Molecule RNA Mobility Assay to Identify Proteins that Link RNAs to Molecular Motors Heinlein, M. (Editor) RNA Tagging: Methods and Protocols Springer US, 2020; 269-282 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ). To do this, we fused the RH1 domain of the myosin 5a adaptor RILPL2 to the C terminus of the MCP-Halo construct. In cells expressing the MCP-Halo-RH1 fusion protein, nearly all mRNAs were highly immobile compared to non-anchored mRNAs ( Figure S3 B), allowing long-term imaging of single mRNAs not localized to SGs ( Video S4 ). Using a cell line expressing the MCP-Halo-RH1 construct, we first imaged the ATF4-SunTag reporter mRNAs during arsenite stress. Similar to the SG-localized mRNAs, we observed an increase of SunTag signal from background intensities on a population of the actin-anchored mRNAs ( Figure 4 C; Video S4 ). Using the same analysis as for SG-localized mRNAs, we measured an elongation rate of 2.9 ± 0.4 codons/s for the actin-anchored ATF4-SunTag mRNAs ( Figures 4 D and S3 C).

SunTag Signal Buildup on SG-Localized mRNA, Related to Figure 4 Time-lapse movie showing the buildup of SunTag signal on a SG-localized ATF4-SunTag mRNA (arrow). Cells were treated with 100 μM sodium arsenite for 30-60 min and imaged with 2 s intervals.
In order to measure the rate of elongation in non-stressed cells, we generated a SunTag construct that lacks the ATF4 5′UTR, because ATF4-SunTag mRNAs are poorly translated in the absence of stress. This resulted in determination of an elongation rate of 4.0 ± 0.5 codons/s using the same method as described above ( Figures S3 D and S3E). As an alternative approach, we performed measurements of ribosome run-off after treatment with the translation inhibitor harringtonine. Harringtonine stalls ribosomes during the initial round of peptide bond formation, while allowing ribosomes further downstream to complete translation and run off the mRNA. This leads to a gradual decay of the SunTag signal on mRNAs, allowing an alternative measurement of the elongation rate ( Wang et al., 2016 67. Wang, C. ∙ Han, B. ∙ Zhou, R. ... Real-Time Imaging of Translation on Single mRNA Transcripts in Live Cells Cell. 2016; 165 :990-1001 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2016 73.

Using this approach, we determined an elongation rate of 4.4 codons/s on the SunTag mRNAs in non-stressed cells ( Figures S3 F and S3G). Taken together, these data suggest that the elongation rate of SG-localized mRNAs is comparable to elongation rates on mRNAs that are not localized to SGs in both stressed and unstressed cells.
To further test whether active protein synthesis occurs on SG-localized mRNAs, we imaged the SunTag-containing SG-localized mRNAs directly after treatment with puromycin, a translational inhibitor that causes premature chain termination by incorporating into the growing peptide chain. We observed that SG-localized mRNAs lose the SunTag signal within 1 min of puromycin addition ( Figures S3 H–S3J; Video S5 ), which is similar to previous translation site imaging experiments with membrane-anchored or cytosolic reporter mRNAs ( Yan et al., 2016 73. Yan, X. ∙ Hoek, T.A. ∙ Vale, R.D. ... Dynamics of Translation of Single mRNA Molecules In Vivo Cell. 2016; 165 :976-989 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2019 74. Zhao, N. ∙ Kamijo, K. ∙ Fox, P.D. ... A genetically encoded probe for imaging nascent and mature HA-tagged proteins in vivo Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2947 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data demonstrate that the SunTag signal on SG-localized mRNAs comes from nascent polypeptides bound to ribosomes that are capable of peptidyl transfer. Moreover, these results exclude the possibility that the interaction of translating mRNAs with SGs is mediated by the SunTag-containing peptides, as we observe the mRNA localized to SGs before the SunTag signal appears as well as after the SunTag signal disappears.

SunTag Signal Buildup on Actin-Anchored mRNA, Related to Figure 4 Time-lapse movie showing the buildup of SunTag signal on ATF4-SunTag reporter mRNA in cells expressing scFv-GFP, G3BP1-SNAP and MCP-Halo-RH1. Cells were treated with 100 μM sodium arsenite for 30-60 min and imaged with 10 s intervals and Z stack acquisition.
In some of our movies, we observed the ATF4-SunTag mRNAs transitioning between the cytosol and SGs. In particular, we observed translating mRNAs moving from the cytosol to SGs, where they remained localized to SGs and labeled with the SunTag signal ( Figure 5 A; Video S6 ). SG-localized translating mRNA were also observed to be released from SGs while still containing the SunTag signal ( Figure 5 B; Video S7 ). Similarly, non-translating mRNAs were observed to transition from cytosol to SGs and from SGs to cytosol without a change in the translational status ( Figures S4 A and S4B). These events were relatively rare, because most mRNAs remained in either the cytosol or a SG in our movies.

Translating mRNA Arriving to a SG, Related to Figure 5 Time-lapse movie showing a translating ATF4-SunTag mRNA (arrow) arriving from cytosol to a SG. Cells were treated with 100 μM sodium arsenite for 1 h and imaged with 1 s intervals.
To get more insight into the correlation between translational status and mRNA partitioning, we expanded our image analysis workflow in order to identify tracks that show a clear transition between a SG and the cytosol within our imaging dataset. This analysis revealed that mRNAs leaving SGs are slightly more likely to be translationally active (50% of mRNA) compared to mRNAs arriving to SGs (32% of mRNA) ( Figure 5 C). This supports the observations that non-translating mRNAs have a higher tendency to localize to SGs ( Figure 2 E), and a fraction of SG-localized mRNAs can switch from non-translating to translating state before leaving SGs ( Figure 4 A). It is important to note, however, that initiation of translation of a SG-localized mRNA does not necessarily drive its release from a SG.
Our data indicate that SG-associated translation is relatively common for the ATF4-SunTag mRNA, which is translationally upregulated during stress due to its complex 5′UTR with two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) ( Vattem and Wek, 2004 64. Vattem, K.M. ∙ Wek, R.C. Reinitiation involving upstream ORFs regulates ATF4 mRNA translation in mammalian cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :11269-11274 Crossref Scopus (1278) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although such uORFs are present in ~50% of the human transcriptome ( Calvo et al., 2009 13. Calvo, S.E. ∙ Pagliarini, D.J. ∙ Mootha, V.K. Upstream open reading frames cause widespread reduction of protein expression and are polymorphic among humans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :7507-7512 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ; Johnstone et al., 2016 32. Johnstone, T.G. ∙ Bazzini, A.A. ∙ Giraldez, A.J. Upstream ORFs are prevalent translational repressors in vertebrates EMBO J. 2016; 35 :706-723 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), many mRNAs have a simpler 5′UTR and are translationally repressed during stress. One important group are 5′TOP mRNAs, which constitute up to 20% of all mRNAs in vertebrate cells and are characterized by the presence of the 5′ terminal oligo pyrimidine (5′TOP) cis -acting element ( Iadevaia et al., 2008 28. Iadevaia, V. ∙ Caldarola, S. ∙ Tino, E. ... All translation elongation factors and the e, f, and h subunits of translation initiation factor 3 are encoded by 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs RNA. 2008; 14 :1730-1736 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5′TOP mRNAs undergo strong repression during cellular stress and concomitant accumulation in SGs ( Damgaard and Lykke-Andersen, 2011 15. Damgaard, C.K. ∙ Lykke-Andersen, J. Translational coregulation of 5’TOP mRNAs by TIA-1 and TIAR Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :2057-2068 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2018 39. Li, B.B. ∙ Qian, C. ∙ Gameiro, P.A. ... Targeted profiling of RNA translation reveals mTOR-4EBP1/2-independent translation regulation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E9325-E9332 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilbertz et al., 2019 70. Wilbertz, J.H. ∙ Voigt, F. ∙ Horvathova, I. ... Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :946-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, it has been shown that repression of 5′TOP mRNA translation during amino acid starvation is mediated by the SG components TIA-1 and TIAR ( Damgaard and Lykke-Andersen, 2011 15. Damgaard, C.K. ∙ Lykke-Andersen, J. Translational coregulation of 5’TOP mRNAs by TIA-1 and TIAR Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :2057-2068 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, 5′TOP mRNAs are a prominent example of mRNAs that are assumed to be repressed in SGs ( Fonseca et al., 2018 20. Fonseca, B.D. ∙ Lahr, R.M. ∙ Damgaard, C.K. ... LARP1 on TOP of ribosome production Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2018; e1480 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ivanov et al., 2011 29. Ivanov, P. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Anderson, P. Stress puts TIA on TOP Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :2119-2124 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine if SG-associated translation occurs for mRNAs other than ATF4 that are also repressed during stress, we used a SunTag reporter mRNA harboring a 5′TOP motif from the 5′UTR of RPL32 (ribosomal protein L32) ( Wilbertz et al., 2019 70. Wilbertz, J.H. ∙ Voigt, F. ∙ Horvathova, I. ... Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :946-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to the ATF4-SunTag system described above, we generated a cell line carrying the 5′TOP-SunTag reporter under doxycycline-inducible promoter and stably expressing the scFv-GFP, MCP-Halo and G3BP1-SNAP ( Figure 6 A). Using luciferase assays, we confirmed that the translation of the 5′TOP-SunTag reporter is suppressed during increased levels of oxidative stress, concomitant with SG formation ( Figure 6 B). Using single-molecule imaging, we measured that at least 76% of 5′TOP-SunTag mRNA are undergoing active translation under normal conditions. The fraction of translating mRNA was reduced dramatically to less than 2% during arsenite stress treatment ( Figure 6 C). Interestingly, the analysis of translation during stress revealed only 6 translating cytosolic mRNAs (out of 292 cytosolic mRNA) and 2 translating SG-localized mRNAs (out of 169 SG-localized mRNA) ( Figures 6 C and 6D; Video S8 ). Although this dramatic inhibition of translation during stress prevented us from performing a more detailed analysis, the data demonstrate that translation of 5′TOP mRNA in stressed cells is similarly rare in the cytosol as in SGs. In other words, SG-associated translation of 5′TOP mRNA is rare, but not due to SG-localization per se. In this case, SG-associated translation is rare because the conditions that permit SG formation simultaneously lead to strong translation repression for this class of transcripts.

Translating mRNAs Leaving a SG, Related to Figure 5 Time-lapse movie showing a translating ATF4-SunTag mRNA (arrow) leaving a SG. Cells were treated with 100 μM sodium arsenite for 1 h and imaged with 1 s intervals.
P-bodies (PBs) are another type of cytoplasmic membraneless organelle believed to contain non-translating mRNAs ( Teixeira et al., 2005 62. Teixeira, D. ∙ Sheth, U. ∙ Valencia-Sanchez, M.A. ... Processing bodies require RNA for assembly and contain nontranslating mRNAs RNA. 2005; 11 :371-382 Crossref Scopus (551) PubMed Google Scholar ). PBs and SGs are often located in close physical proximity and share some of their components ( Kedersha et al., 2005 34. Kedersha, N. ∙ Stoecklin, G. ∙ Ayodele, M. ... Stress granules and processing bodies are dynamically linked sites of mRNP remodeling J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169 :871-884 Crossref Scopus (1139) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matheny et al., 2019 41.

Biol. 2019; 39 :e00313-19 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether our ATF4-SunTag reporter mRNAs are also translated in PBs, we exchanged the SG marker (G3BP1-SNAP) for a PB marker (SNAP-DCP1a) and performed similar imaging and analysis as described above. In contrast to SGs, we did not observe a stable association between the ATF4-SunTag mRNA and PBs during arsenite stress ( Figures 7 A and 7B). We often observe the mRNAs localized close to PBs but rarely overlapping, possibly reflecting localization to SGs ( Figure 7 A). We further observe mRNAs transiently touching PBs ( Figure 7 C; Video S9 ), but not forming a stable association. Although we cannot exclude that other mRNA species could be translated in PBs, these data suggest that the SG-associated translation observed for ATF4-Suntag does not occur in PBs.

Section: Discussion

It is widely believed that SGs contain exclusively non-translating mRNA, leading to the assumption that all mRNAs observed in SGs (e.g., using FISH or sequencing-based methods) are in a translationally repressed state ( Adjibade et al., 2015 1. Adjibade, P. ∙ St-Sauveur, V.G. ∙ Quevillon Huberdeau, M. ... Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, induces formation of stress granules in hepatocarcinoma cells Oncotarget. 2015; 6 :43927-43943 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mollet et al., 2008 42. Mollet, S. ∙ Cougot, N. ∙ Wilczynska, A. ... Translationally repressed mRNA transiently cycles through stress granules during stress Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19 :4469-4479 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ; Namkoong et al., 2018 47. Namkoong, S. ∙ Ho, A. ∙ Woo, Y.M. ... Systematic Characterization of Stress-Induced RNA Granulation Mol. Cell. 2018; 70 :175-187 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is based on the observations that SG formation coincides with general translational inhibition during stress and on immunofluorescence analysis of SGs that concluded that SGs are devoid of 60S ribosomal subunits. Antibodies against the 60S components L5, L37, and Po did not show enrichment in SGs, whereas antibodies against 40S components showed strong signal in SGs ( Kedersha et al., 2002 33. Kedersha, N. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Gilks, N. ... Evidence that ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)(Met))-deficient preinitiation complexes are core constituents of mammalian stress granules Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 :195-210 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kimball et al., 2003 38. Kimball, S.R. ∙ Horetsky, R.L. ∙ Ron, D. ... Mammalian stress granules represent sites of accumulation of stalled translation initiation complexes Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284 :C273-C284 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, the current model postulates that SG-localized mRNA are bound only by 40S subunit, representing “stalled preinitiation complexes” ( Anderson and Kedersha, 2008 3. Anderson, P. ∙ Kedersha, N. Stress granules: the Tao of RNA triage Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33 :141-150 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (874) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ivanov et al., 2019 30. Ivanov, P. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Anderson, P. Stress Granules and Processing Bodies in Translational Control Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11 :a032813 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ; Panas et al., 2016 53. Panas, M.D. ∙ Ivanov, P. ∙ Anderson, P. Mechanistic insights into mammalian stress granule dynamics J.

Neurosci. 2019; 20 :649-666 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ). We believe this model holds true for most SG-localized mRNA, however, our data indicate it cannot be generalized for all mRNA localized to SGs and that mRNA localization to SGs does not require or cause translation inhibition.
Interestingly, there is evidence in the literature for the presence of 60S subunits in SGs. First, the immunofluorescence stainings for L5 and L37 proteins showed signal overlapping with SGs, albeit weaker than the signal of 40S components ( Kimball et al., 2003 38. Kimball, S.R. ∙ Horetsky, R.L. ∙ Ron, D. ... Mammalian stress granules represent sites of accumulation of stalled translation initiation complexes Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284 :C273-C284 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, a recent study has shown that 60S subunits can also accumulate in SGs during certain conditions that impair the protein quality control machinery ( Seguin et al., 2014 60. Seguin, S.J. ∙ Morelli, F.F. ∙ Vinet, J. ... Inhibition of autophagy, lysosome and VCP function impairs stress granule assembly Cell Death Differ. 2014; 21 :1838-1851 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that most SG-localized mRNAs are indeed “stalled preinitiation complexes,” while some can recruit 60S subunits and undergo translation.
Importantly, the data presented here demonstrate that localization to SGs does not prevent mRNA translation. Evidence is now emerging that SGs do not have a large effect on global translation. Transcriptomic studies revealed that only ~10% of mRNA molecules accumulate in SGs ( Khong et al., 2017 37. Khong, A. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :808-820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it has been shown that G3BP-deficient cells are able to inhibit bulk translation during stress without forming SGs ( Kedersha et al., 2016 35. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study indicates that even the mRNAs recruited to SGs are not translationally repressed by the SG environment. Although we see a slight over-representation of non-translating mRNAs in SGs, this can be explained by the preferential recruitment of non-translating mRNAs to SGs ( Figure 2 E), rather than silencing of translation in SGs. This observation of preferential recruitment of non-translating mRNAs is consistent with previous reports. For example, mRNA accumulation in SGs has been shown to correlate with the expected time of ribosome runoff from mRNAs of different lengths ( Khong and Parker, 2018 36. Khong, A. ∙ Parker, R. mRNP architecture in translating and stress conditions reveals an ordered pathway of mRNP compaction J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :4124-4140 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Padrón et al., 2019 51. Padrón, A. ∙ Iwasaki, S. ∙ Ingolia, N.T. Proximity RNA Labeling by APEX-Seq Reveals the Organization of Translation Initiation Complexes and Repressive RNA Granules Mol. Cell. 2019; 75 :875-887 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, our analysis of single mRNA translation dynamics indicates that localization to SGs does not prevent either translation initiation or efficient elongation. Taken together, the data argue that SGs have a preference for recruitment of non-translating mRNAs, but SGs do not directly repress any aspect of mRNA translation.
Membrane-less organelles or biomolecular condensates are now thought to partition cellular environments in order to enable a wide variety of biological processes to be specifically regulated ( Banani et al., 2017 6. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Crossref Scopus (3257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Boeynaems et al., 2018 12. Boeynaems, S. ∙ Alberti, S. ∙ Fawzi, N.L. ... Protein Phase Separation: A New Phase in Cell Biology Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :420-435 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1260) PubMed Google Scholar ). This study demonstrates that it is necessary to quantitatively measure the biological processes both inside and outside of the organelle in order to understand its function. The continued development of single-molecule imaging techniques and fluorescent biosensors coupled with the identification of separation-of-function mutants or chemical biology tools will play a key role toward understanding the function of biomolecular condensates.

HeLa cells used in this study are derived from the previously-described HeLa-11ht cell line ( Weidenfeld et al., 2009 68. Weidenfeld, I. ∙ Gossen, M. ∙ Löw, R. ... Inducible expression of coding and inhibitory RNAs from retargetable genomic loci Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :e50 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), which contains a site for Flp-RMCE (recombinase-mediated cassette exchange), allowing a single-copy genomic integration of a target gene. The cell line is further expressing a reverse tetracycline controlled transactivator (rtTA2S-M2), allowing doxycycline-inducible expression of the inserted gene. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/L glucose, Penicillin (100 U/ml), Streptomycin (100 μg/ml), L-Glutamine (4mM) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . For transient transfections, we used Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) with Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions, but scaled down to 250 ng DNA and 1 μL Lipofectamine per 1 mL growth media.
To generate the ATF4-SunTag reporter, we have modified the previously-described SunTag- Renilla -MS2 plasmid ( Wilbertz et al., 2019 70. Wilbertz, J.H. ∙ Voigt, F. ∙ Horvathova, I. ... Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :946-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Addgene plasmid #119945) by inserting the cDNA of human ATF4 5′UTR (until the end of uORF2, thereby including the first 27 amino acids of the main coding sequence that overlap with uORF2) using HindIII and RsrII restriction sites. The resulting plasmid contains a Tet-CMV (cytomegalovirus) promoter followed by ATF4 5′UTR, SunTag(24xGCN4), Renilla luciferase, destabilized FKBP domain ( Banaszynski et al., 2006 7. Banaszynski, L.A. ∙ Chen, L.-C. ∙ Maynard-Smith, L.A. ... A rapid, reversible, and tunable method to regulate protein function in living cells using synthetic small molecules Cell. 2006; 126 :995-1004 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a stop codon, 24xMS2 stem-loop cassette, CTE (constitutive transport element) and SV40 poly(A) tail. The main coding sequence of ATF4 is in frame with SunTag and Renilla luciferase. For detection of SGs and PBs, we used the previously-described lentiviral vectors carrying G3BP1-SNAP (Addgene plasmid #119949) ( Wilbertz et al., 2019 70. Wilbertz, J.H. ∙ Voigt, F. ∙ Horvathova, I. ... Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :946-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) and SNAP-DCP1a ( Horvathova et al., 2017 27. Horvathova, I. ∙ Voigt, F. ∙ Kotrys, A.V. ... The Dynamics of mRNA Turnover Revealed by Single-Molecule Imaging in Single Cells Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :615-625 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. The NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo-RH1 construct was generated via restriction-free cloning into the pHAGE UbiC lentiviral backbone as described previously ( Voigt et al., 2017 65. Voigt, F. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Cui, X.A. ... Single-Molecule Quantification of Translation-Dependent Association of mRNAs with the Endoplasmic Reticulum Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3740-3753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The ATF4-SunTag reporter was stably integrated into a previously-described HeLa-11ht cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged single-chain antibodies (scFv-GFP) against GCN4 (Addgene plasmid #104998) and NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo fusion protein (Addgene plasmid #104999) ( Voigt et al., 2017 65. Voigt, F. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Cui, X.A. ... Single-Molecule Quantification of Translation-Dependent Association of mRNAs with the Endoplasmic Reticulum Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3740-3753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genomic integration was achieved via RMCE as previously described ( Weidenfeld et al., 2009 68. Weidenfeld, I. ∙ Gossen, M. ∙ Löw, R. ... Inducible expression of coding and inhibitory RNAs from retargetable genomic loci Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :e50 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 3 × 10 5 HeLa cells were seeded into a 6-well plate and next day transfected with 2 μg of the FLPe recombinase plasmid (Addgene #20733) ( Beard et al., 2006 8. Beard, C. ∙ Hochedlinger, K. ∙ Plath, K. ... Efficient method to generate single-copy transgenic mice by site-specific integration in embryonic stem cells Genesis. 2006; 44 :23-28 Crossref Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ) together with 2 μg of the plasmid carrying the SunTag reporter flanked by Flp-recombinase target sites. The next day, 5 μg/mL puromycin (Invivogen) was added to select for transfected cells. Two days later, the puromycin-containing medium was removed and cells were kept in growth medium containing 50 μM ganciclovir (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 days to select for cells with successful RMCE. In order to generate a single-clone cell line, single-cell sorting into a 96-well plate was performed. The cells were then expanded, and reporter expression was tested with luciferase assays. The cell line carrying the 5′TOP element-containing SunTag reporter (Addgene plasmid #119946) together with scFv-GFP and NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo was described previously ( Wilbertz et al., 2019 70. Wilbertz, J.H. ∙ Voigt, F. ∙ Horvathova, I. ... Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response Mol. Cell. 2019; 73 :946-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). G3BP1-SNAP was then stably integrated into reporter-expressing cell lines (ATF4-SunTag or 5′TOP-SunTag) using a third-generation lentiviral system ( Mostoslavsky et al., 2006 46. Mostoslavsky, G. ∙ Fabian, A.J. ∙ Rooney, S. ... Complete correction of murine Artemis immunodeficiency by lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :16406-16411 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lentivirus production and infection was performed under BL-2 (biosafety level 2) conditions. Lentivirus production was performed by transfecting HEK293T cells with the G3BP1-SNAP in pHAGE lentiviral backbone along with the accessory plasmids VSV-G, Gag/Pol, Tat, Rev, using Fugene 6 (Promega). Supernatant was harvested from the transfected cells for the next three days and then centrifuged, filtered through 0.45 μM filter (Millipore) and concentrated using LentiX concentrator (Clontech). HeLa cells were then infected with the lentivirus, incubated for 6 days, passaged and subsequently FACS-sorted to select positive cells. For experiments with actin-anchored mRNAs, lentiviral infection was used to generate cell lines expressing NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo-RH1, scFv-GFP, and G3BP1-SNAP (where indicated). SunTag- Renilla -MS2 reporter plasmid (“SunTag mRNA” in short, Addgene #119945) was integrated into the cells using RMCE as described above. The ATF4-SunTag reporter plasmid was transiently transfected (as described above) for the imaging of actin-anchored mRNAs during stress.
Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega) was used for measuring the production of SunTag reporters. Cells carrying the ATF4-SunTag or 5′TOP-SunTag reporters (both also expressing scFv-GFP and NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo) were seeded on 24-well plates. The next day, expression of reporters was induced with 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 2 hours. The medium was then washed out with PBS and replaced with a fresh medium containing different concentrations of sodium arsenite (Sigma). After 1 h incubation, the cells were lysed with 150 μL Passive Lysis Buffer per well. Lysate (30 μL) was then transferred to wells of a 96-well EIA/RIA Plate (Costar) in triplicate. Bioluminescence measurements were performed using the Mithras LB 940 microplate reader (Berthold), injecting 12 μL of Renilla Luciferase Assay Reagent per well. The means and standard error of the mean (SEM) are calculated based on 3 biological replicates (each consisting of 3 technical replicates).
Cells were plated on glass coverslips (High Precision, 170 μm thickness, 18 mm diameter, Paul Marienfeld GmbH) in 12-well plates. Two days later, cells were treated as indicated, followed by a quick wash in PBS and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS for 10 minutes. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 5 minutes. Afterward, the cells were washed in PBS and incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS for 1 hour. This was followed by a 1 h incubation with primary antibodies (diluted in 1% BSA in PBS), three washes in PBS, and a 1 h incubation with secondary antibodies (diluted in 1% BSA in PBS). The following antibodies were used: Mouse anti-G3BP1 (BD Biosciences, 611127), rabbit anti-TIA-1 (Abcam, ab40693). Corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor dyes (Invitrogen) were used. After incubation with secondary antibodies, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted on microscope slides (VWR International) in DAPI-containing Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Samples were imaged on the spinning-disk confocal microscope described in the “Live cell imaging” section, using single-camera sequential acquisition. Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 59. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40004) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for image processing (cropping, brightness adjustment, merging channels, labeling with scale bars). Fractions of cells with SGs were counted manually based on immunofluorescence staining of G3BP1 after 1 h treatment with 0, 12.5 μM, 25 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM, or 200 μM sodium arsenite (715 cells were counted in total).
To detect endogenous ATF4 mRNA, FISH probes targeting human ATF4 (designed using the Stellaris Probe Designer) were made by enzymatic oligonucleotide labeling ( Gáspár et al., 2018 21. Gáspár, I. ∙ Wippich, F. ∙ Ephrussi, A. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Mediated Production of Labeled Probes for Single-molecule FISH or RNA Capture Bio-protocol. 2018; 8 :e2750 Crossref Google Scholar ), using Amino-11-ddUTP (Lumiprobe) and Atto565-NHS (ATTO-TEC). To detect the ATF4-SunTag mRNA, we used Stellaris FISH probes targeting Renilla luciferase and labeled with the Quasar 570 dye (Biosearch Technologies). Cells were plated on glass coverslips (High Precision, 170 μm thickness, 18 mm diameter, Paul Marienfeld GmbH) in 12-well plates. Two days later, cells were treated as indicated, followed by a quick wash in PBS and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS for 10 minutes. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 5 minutes. Afterward, the cells were further washed with PBS and then washed two times with a wash buffer (10% formamide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 2x saline sodium citrate (SSC). Coverslips were then incubated for 4 h with hybridization solution (2 x SSC, 10% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.5% BSA, 200 nM FISH probes) at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Cells were then washed twice with a wash buffer for 30 min and then twice with PBS. Immunofluorescence staining was subsequently performed according to the “immunofluorescence” section (from BSA blocking to mounting). Samples were imaged on the spinning-disk confocal microscope described in the “Live cell imaging” section, using single-camera sequential acquisition.
Cells were plated on glass-bottom 35 mm μ-Dish (ibidi GmbH) or μ-Slide (ibidi GmbH). After 2 days, the growth medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing 1 μg/mL doxycycline in order to induce the transcription of reporter mRNAs. After 70 minutes, the medium was further supplemented with JF585 HaloTag ligand and JF646 SNAP-tag ligand, obtained from L. Lavis (Janelia Research Campus) ( Grimm et al., 2015 22. Grimm, J.B. ∙ English, B.P. ∙ Chen, J. ... A general method to improve fluorophores for live-cell and single-molecule microscopy Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :244-250 Crossref Scopus (1040) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 23. Grimm, J.B. ∙ Muthusamy, A.K. ∙ Liang, Y. ... A general method to fine-tune fluorophores for live-cell and in vivo imaging Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :987-994 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ), each at 100 nM final concentration. After 20 minutes of further incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed in PBS. Cells were then kept in FluoroBrite DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS and 4 mM L-glutamine (and sodium arsenite if indicated) for the indicated time and during imaging. Cells were then imaged on an inverted microscope Ti2-E Eclipse (Nikon) equipped with CSU-W1 Confocal Scanner Unit (Yokogawa), 2 back-illuminated EMCCD cameras iXon-Ultra-888 (Andor), MS-2000 motorized stage (Applied Scientific Instrumentation) and VisiView® imaging software (Visitron Systems GmbH). Illumination was achieved with 561 Cobolt Jive (Cobolt), 488 iBeam Smart, 639 iBeam Smart (Toptica Photonics) lasers and VS-Homogenizer (Visitron Systems GmbH). CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda 100X Oil/1.45 objective (Nikon) was used, resulting in pixel size of 0.13 μm. Unless otherwise stated, excitation in 3 channels was performed sequentially in a single plane. The 488 nm channel emission was detected on the second camera. To correct for camera misalignment, images of 0.5 μm fluorescent beads were acquired using the TetraSpeck Fluorescent Microspheres Size Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on each imaging session. During all incubation steps as well as imaging, the cells were kept at 37°C and 5% CO 2 .
To perform time-lapse imaging immediately after puromycin addition, puromycin was pre-diluted in FluoroBrite and added to the μ-Slide mounted on the microscope stage with cells in the field of view and in focus. Image acquisition was started within 10-20 s after puromycin addition using 1 s intervals. Fluorescence intensities were measured and normalized the same way as described in the section “Measurement of SunTag intensity buildup.” Mean values were then calculated for each time point and plotted together with the individual curves in Prism.
First, images of fluorescent beads were used to measure the channel shift using the Descriptor-based registration plugin ( Preibisch et al., 2010 55. Preibisch, S. ∙ Saalfeld, S. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... Software for bead-based registration of selective plane illumination microscopy data Nat. Methods. 2010; 7 :418-419 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ) in Fiji ( Rueden et al., 2017 57. Rueden, C.T. ∙ Schindelin, J. ∙ Hiner, M.C. ... ImageJ2: ImageJ for the next generation of scientific image data BMC Bioinformatics. 2017; 18 :529 Crossref Scopus (4008) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schindelin et al., 2012 59. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40004) PubMed Google Scholar ). The affine transformation model was then re-applied to the 488 nm channel in all movies acquired on the same imaging session using a Fiji macro. To create representative movies and images, Fiji was used to create maximum intensity projections (in case of multi-plane acquisition) and correct for photobleaching using the Bleach correction plugin with the “simple ratio” correction method. Fiji was further used for cropping, brightness adjustment, merging channels, labeling images with scale bars, arrows and time, and for creating montages from movies.
To measure the rate of ribosome runoff after harringtonine treatment, we used a cell line carrying the scFv-GFP, NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo-RH1, and the stably integrated SunTag- Renilla -MS2 reporter (Addgene plasmid #119945). This mRNA reporter shares the entire SunTag- Renilla cassette (1013 codons) with the ATF4-SunTag reporter, differing only in the first 11 codons of the coding sequence, which are replaced by 28 codons in the ATF4-SunTag reporter. Cells were prepared as described in the “Live cell imaging” section and kept in FluoroBrite without sodium arsenite. Harringtonine (MedChemExpress) was pre-diluted in FluoroBrite and added to the cells (final concentration 3 μg/ml) mounted on the microscope stage. Image acquisition was started approximately 30 s after harringtonine addition using 20 s intervals. Channel registration was performed and intensities were measured as described in the section “Measurement of SunTag intensity buildup,” including the local background subtraction. The values were normalized to the intensity at the first frame and mean values were then calculated for each time point. Individual curves and mean values were plotted in Prism.
The averaged curve is expected to show a non-linear decay of fluorescence signal, reflecting the movement of ribosomes along the mRNA and gradual termination of translation ( Wang et al., 2016 67. Wang, C. ∙ Han, B. ∙ Zhou, R. ... Real-Time Imaging of Translation on Single mRNA Transcripts in Live Cells Cell. 2016; 165 :990-1001 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2016 73. Yan, X. ∙ Hoek, T.A. ∙ Vale, R.D. ... Dynamics of Translation of Single mRNA Molecules In Vivo Cell. 2016; 165 :976-989 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the early phase, the curve is expected to show a gradually increasing decay rate, as the ribosomes present on the SunTag-encoding region still generate new epitopes. Once the SunTag-encoding region is depleted of ribosomes, the curve should enter a linear decay phase. At the late stage of the curve, the decay rate gradually slows down, possibly reflecting heterogeneity of elongation rates among mRNAs. To estimate the average time required for ribosomes to translate the entire mRNA, we used linear regression (Prism) to fit the linear phase of the curve and extrapolated the linear fit to the baseline ( Wang et al., 2016 67. Wang, C. ∙ Han, B. ∙ Zhou, R. ... Real-Time Imaging of Translation on Single mRNA Transcripts in Live Cells Cell. 2016; 165 :990-1001 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). According to Wang et al. and considering the length of the SunTag-encoding region and the rest of the coding sequence in our mRNA reporter, this linear phase should start when the SunTag signal drops to 59% of the initial intensity, assuming an even distribution of ribosomes along the mRNA. Based on this, we used the time points from 120 s (y = 0.63) to 180 s (y = 0.28) for the linear fit (R 2 = 0.996). We calculated the elongation rate by dividing the length of the coding sequence (1024 codons) by the X-intercept value of the linear fit.
To measure distances between mRNAs and SG boundary, cells were plated on glass coverslips (High Precision, 170 μm thickness, 18 mm diameter, Paul Marienfeld GmbH) in a 12-well plate. After 2 days, the growth medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing 1 μg/mL doxycycline in order to induce the transcription of reporter mRNAs. After 70 minutes, the medium was further supplemented with JF585 HaloTag ligand and JF646 SNAP-tag ligand, each at 100 nM final concentration. After 20 minutes of further incubation, the medium was removed, washed out with PBS, and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 100 μM sodium arsenite. After 1 h, cells were quickly washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) diluted in PBS for 10 minutes. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and mounted on microscope slides (VWR International) in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Samples were imaged the next day on the spinning-disk confocal microscope described in the “Live cell imaging” section, using single-camera sequential acquisition. In addition to the CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda 100X objective, an extra 2x magnifying lens inside the scan-head in front of the camera was used, resulting in a pixel size of 67 nm. Z stacks acquired with 200 nm step size and 150 nm step size were combined into the final dataset.
The z stacks were analyzed in a custom-built KNIME workflow. Briefly, G3BP1-SNAP signal was used to segment SGs in 3D using Otsu thresholding ( Otsu, 1979 50. Otsu, N. A Threshold Selection Method from Gray-Level Histograms IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybern. 1979; 9 :62-66 Crossref Google Scholar ) after applying Gaussian convolution. A distance map was then generated based on the SG segmentation, calculating the minimal distance of each foreground pixel to the nearest background pixel in 3D. MS2 foci and SunTag foci were then separately detected using a custom-built KNIME node that runs the spot detection module of TrackMate in batch mode. This node is available on KNIME Node Repository: KNIME Image Processing / ImageJ2 / FMI / Spot Detection (Subpixel localization) ( Eglinger, 2019 18. Eglinger, J. fmi-faim/fmi-ij2-plugins fmi-ij2-plugins-0.5.4 Zenodo, 2019 Google Scholar ). An estimated spot radius of 200 nm was used for spot detection in both channels. SunTag foci were assigned to nearby MS2 foci using recursive spot pairing as described in the section “ Track-based classification of mRNAs ”, in this case using 3D coordinates and a distance cutoff of 300 nm. MS2 spots with a paired SunTag spot were labeled as translating, and remaining MS2 spots were labeled as non-translating. Each mRNA (MS2 foci) was then assigned with pixel coordinates and the value on the distance map, reflecting the minimal distance to the nearest pixel outside of SG. These distance map values were then plotted for all translating and non-translating mRNAs within SGs as a density plot using ggplot2 ( Wickham, 2016 69. Wickham, H. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis Springer-Verlag New York, 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ) in R. Prism was used to generate scatterplots showing the mRNA-boundary distances and the SunTag intensities of the paired SunTag foci. 3D visualizations of mRNAs in SGs were created using the Orthogonal Views function in Fiji.
mRNA tracking-based quantification of translation and SG localization was performed using a custom-built workflow in KNIME ( Berthold et al., 2009 9. Berthold, M.R. ∙ Cebron, N. ∙ Dill, F. ... KNIME - the Konstanz Information Miner: Version 2.0 and Beyond SIGKDD Explor. 2009; 11 :26-31 Crossref Google Scholar ; Dietz et al., 2020 17. Dietz, C. ∙ Rueden, C.T. ∙ Helfrich, S. ... Integration of the ImageJ Ecosystem in the KNIME Analytics Platform Front. Comput. Sci. 2020; 2 :8 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, 15-frame (~7 s) long movies (after registration as described above) were imported. Then, ROIs were manually annotated to include cytosol (but not nucleus) of cells with visible mRNA and SGs. Tracking was then performed in both SunTag and MS2 channels using a custom-build KNIME node enabling the software to run TrackMate ( Tinevez et al., 2017 63. Tinevez, J.-Y. ∙ Perry, N. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrackMate: An open and extensible platform for single-particle tracking Methods. 2017; 115 :80-90 Crossref Scopus (1887) PubMed Google Scholar ) in batch mode with the Multi-channel intensity analyzer module. This node is available on KNIME Node Repository: KNIME Image Processing / ImageJ2 / FMI / Track Spots (Subpixel localization, multi-channel) ( Eglinger, 2019 18. Eglinger, J. fmi-faim/fmi-ij2-plugins fmi-ij2-plugins-0.5.4 Zenodo, 2019 Google Scholar ). The tracking process involved spot detection with “Laplacian of Gaussian” detector with estimated spot radius of 200 nm and sub-pixel localization. Detection thresholds were adjusted for each experiment but kept constant within the experiment. As a particle-linking algorithm, the ‘‘Simple LAP tracker’’ was used with maximum linking and gap-closing distances of 1200 nm and maximum gap of 1 frame. To test whether mRNA is localized to SGs, we measured the mean intensity of G3BP1-SNAP at the coordinates of each detected MS2 spot. This intensity was then divided by the mean G3BP1-SNAP intensity of the whole annotated ROI, resulting in values of G3BP1 enrichment at the mRNA foci over the cytosol. We then defined spots with G3BP1 enrichment > 1.3 as localized to SGs. Only when every spot of the track fulfills this condition, the mRNAs are defined as SG-localized. Conversely, when every spot of a track has G3BP1 enrichment < 1.3, the mRNA is defined as cytosolic. Tracks that do not fulfill either condition are not assigned localization due to ambiguity (e.g., localization at SG boundary or only transient colocalization). Exceptionally, mRNAs were defined as “arriving to SG” when at least 2 spots (including the first) were “cytosolic” and at least 4 spots (including the last) were “localized to SGs.” mRNAs were defined as “leaving SG” when at least 4 spots (including the first) were “localized to SGs” and at least 2 spots (including the last) were “cytosolic.”
To determine the translational status of mRNAs, we performed pairwise colocalization of MS2 and SunTag track coordinates as previously described ( Voigt et al., 2018 66. Voigt, F. ∙ Eglinger, J. ∙ Chao, J.A. Detection of the First Round of Translation: The TRICK Assay Methods Mol. Biol. 2018; 1649 :373-384 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ), linking the mutual nearest neighbors between the two channels within a distance cutoff of 500 nm. The MS2 tracks are then classified as translating mRNA if they contain at least 2 colocalizing spot pairs, and MS2 tracks that contain less than 4 spots are excluded from the analysis. All other MS2 tracks are classified as non-translating. Fractions of translating mRNA were then calculated from all SG-localized or all cytosolic mRNA in each cell. Similarly, the fractions of SG-localized mRNA were calculated from all translating or all non-translating mRNAs. Global fractions per experiment were further determined from total numbers of tracks (without cell-level grouping) to avoid bias toward cells with low mRNA numbers, and were used to calculate the average values, SEM, and p values (paired t test). The global fractions per experiment were plotted together with cell-level values as SuperPlots ( Lord et al., 2020 40. Lord, S.J. ∙ Velle, K.B. ∙ Mullins, R.D. ... SuperPlots: Communicating reproducibility and variability in cell biology J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219 :e202001064 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) using GraphPad Prism. To quantify mRNA localization to PBs, we used the same workflow as for SGs, measuring SNAP-DCP1a signal instead of G3BP1-SNAP signal.
To measure the changes in fluorescence intensity over time, measurements were performed using Fiji on registered movies. Mean intensity of SunTag and MS2 signal on mRNA foci was measured at each time point in round ROIs with 5-pixel diameter. Local background fluorescence was measured at each time point in doughnut-shaped ROIs around the foci and subtracted from the foci intensities. For each time point (t), three-frame moving averages were then calculated from t, t+1, t+2, and used for normalization and alignment of the intensity curves. First, curves were normalized by dividing each value by the highest moving average of the entire track (y = 1 corresponding to the highest moving average, while individual data points can be above 1). Second, the curves were aligned at x = 0, defined as the first time point with moving average above 0.20. Mean values were calculated from the normalized and aligned values. The normalized intensity curves along with the mean values (black lines) were plotted in GraphPad Prism. The buildup of fluorescence intensity on newly translated mRNAs includes an “initial phase” with background-corrected SunTag intensities close to 0, an “increasing phase” and a “plateau phase.” Assuming that the initiation rate remains constant after the mRNA starts being translated, the duration of the “increasing phase” reflects the time it takes for the first ribosome to reach the stop codon ( Ruijtenberg et al., 2020 58. Ruijtenberg, S. ∙ Sonneveld, S. ∙ Cui, T.J. ... mRNA structural dynamics shape Argonaute-target interactions Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :790-801 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). The duration of the “increasing phase” can, therefore, be used to estimate the translation elongation rate on the SG-localized mRNAs. Some of the curves also exhibited a drop in intensity after the plateau. These frames were filtered out when the 3-frame moving average decreased below 0.5 after the maximal value. In order to calculate the duration of the “increasing phase,” we then fit the data to a three-part model. We assume that the background-corrected intensity is 0 until time t 1 , then it increases at rate β between time t 1 and t 2 , and from time t 2 it stays constant. Let t be the time in seconds and X(t) be the signal intensity. We assume that 𝑋 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = ⎧ { ⎨ { ⎩ 0 𝛽 ⁢ ( 𝑡 − 𝑡 1 ) 𝛽 ⁢ ( 𝑡 2 − 𝑡 1 ) ⁢ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡 1 𝑡 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡 2 𝑡 2 ≤ 𝑡 The optimal parameters β, t 1 , and t 2 minimize the least-square error between expected and measured signal intensity. This optimization was done with the MATLAB function lsqcurvefit. To estimate the elongation rate, we then calculated the number of codons that can contribute to the increase of SunTag intensity. We counted the codons between the end of first GCN4 repeat and the stop codon. 30 codons were further subtracted to correct for the length of the ribosome exit tunnel ( Boersma et al., 2019 11. Boersma, S. ∙ Khuperkar, D. ∙ Verhagen, B.M.P. ... Multi-Color Single-Molecule Imaging Uncovers Extensive Heterogeneity in mRNA Decoding Cell. 2019; 178 :458-472 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of codons (947) was then divided by the calculated duration of the “increasing phase” and reported in codons/s ± SEM
Measurements of SG area were performed in KNIME using the movies of cells expressing ATF4-SunTag, NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo, scFv-GFP, and G3BP1-SNAP (described in Figure 2 ). SGs were segmented in the first frame of the movie using Gaussian convolution followed by Otsu thresholding. Next, the scFv-GFP and NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo channels were projected (average intensity across time), blurred (Gaussian convolution) and used for segmentation of the cytoplasm. First, nuclei were segmented based on the NLS-stdMCP-stdHalo signal followed by filtering by size. Next, cells were segmented with seeded watershed (using the scFv-GFP channel and segmented nuclei as seeds). The nuclei segments were then subtracted from the cell segments to generate “cytoplasm” ROIs, and segmented SGs were subtracted to generate “cytosol” ROIs. The fraction of cytoplasmic area occupied by SGs was then calculated for each cell. Mean intensity of G3BP1 was also measured within the segmented SGs and the rest of cytosol in each cell. Mean G3BP1 enrichment was calculated by dividing the mean G3BP1 intensity in the given compartment (SGs or cytosol) by the mean G3BP1 intensity in the cytoplasm. All plots were made in Prism.
Instantaneous diffusion coefficients (IDC) were determined as previously described ( Voigt et al., 2017 65. Voigt, F. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Cui, X.A. ... Single-Molecule Quantification of Translation-Dependent Association of mRNAs with the Endoplasmic Reticulum Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3740-3753 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a custom-built KNIME workflow. First, 25-frame (~12 s) long movies (after channel registration) were imported. Cell annotation and mRNA tracking was performed exactly as described in the section “Track-based classification of mRNAs”. IDC was then calculated for each mRNA trajectory (MCP-Halo channel) using a custom-made component node available via KNIME Hub (KNIME Hub > Users > imagejan > Public > fmi-basel > components > Instantaneous Diffusion Coefficient). Classification of mRNA localization and translation status was then performed exactly as described in the section “Track-based classification of mRNAs,” with tracks shorter than 5 frames filtered out. Values were plotted as scatterplots in Prism and density plots in R.
