Title: Glycogen accumulation and phase separation drives liver tumor initiation


Abstract: Summary

Glucose consumption is generally increased in tumor cells to support tumor growth. Interestingly, we report that glycogen accumulation is a key initiating oncogenic event during liver malignant transformation. We found that glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) catalyzing the last step of glycogenolysis is frequently downregulated to augment glucose storage in pre-malignant cells. Accumulated glycogen undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, which results in the assembly of the Laforin-Mst1/2 complex and consequently sequesters Hippo kinases Mst1/2 in glycogen liquid droplets to relieve their inhibition on Yap. Moreover, G6PC or another glycogenolysis enzyme-liver glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL) deficiency in both human and mice results in glycogen storage disease along with liver enlargement and tumorigenesis in a Yap-dependent manner. Consistently, elimination of glycogen accumulation abrogates liver growth and cancer incidence, whereas increasing glycogen storage accelerates tumorigenesis. Thus, we concluded that cancer-initiating cells adapt a glycogen storing mode, which blocks Hippo signaling through glycogen phase separation to augment tumor incidence.

Section: Introduction

Glucose is among the most consumed nutrients for rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Once glucose is transported into a cell, it can be quickly phosphorylated to glucose-6-phsophate (G6P) and trapped inside cells. G6P is an important precursor metabolite in several metabolic pathways including glycogenesis and glycolysis. Cancer cells are generally believed to rewire their metabolism to the fermentation of G6P to lactate even under normoxic conditions, known as the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis ( Cairns et al., 2011 11.

Understanding the Warburg effect: the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation Science. 2009; 324 :1029-1033 Crossref Scopus (11746) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to providing many metabolite precursors, aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells causes rapid depletion of local glucose and increases lactate, which in turn significantly reshapes the local immune microenvironment ( Pavlova and Thompson, 2016 53. Pavlova, N.N. ∙ Thompson, C.B. The Emerging Hallmarks of Cancer Metabolism Cell Metab. 2016; 23 :27-47 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3821) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, glucose metabolism has complex and important roles in supporting tumor growth. On the other hand, malignant transformation of a cell normally results from the accumulation of genetic, biochemical, and even metabolic alterations ( Faubert et al., 2020 20.

Vogelstein, B. ∙ Papadopoulos, N. ∙ Velculescu, V.E. ... Cancer genome landscapes Science. 2013; 339 :1546-1558 Crossref Scopus (5817) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it is important to elucidate which metabolic modes are essential for the survival of those relatively normal and less proliferating mutated cells (referred to as “pre-malignant cells”) before their malignant transformation and how biochemical changes to these metabolic alterations accelerate the transition from pre-malignant to malignant states.
Glycogen is the largest soluble cytosolic macromolecule and considered as the principal storage form of glucose ( McBride et al., 2009 43. McBride, A. ∙ Ghilagaber, S. ∙ Nikolaev, A. ...

Synthesis and breakdown of glycogen is mainly accomplished by glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP). The expression patterns of GS (GYS1 and GYS2) and GP (PYGM, PYGL, and PYGB) isoforms display in a tissue-differential manner ( Roach et al., 2012 62. Roach, P.J. ∙ Depaoli-Roach, A.A. ∙ Hurley, T.D. ... Glycogen and its metabolism: some new developments and old themes Biochem. J. 2012; 441 :763-787 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ). The glycogen branches are synthesized and elongated by GS enzyme through the formation of α-1,4 glycosidic bonds, which can be broken down by GP enzyme to produce glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) that can be further conversed to G6P, utilized for several metabolic pathways ( Favaro et al., 2012 21.

In addition, de-phosphorylation of G6P into free glucose requires glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC). Although loss-of-function mutations in several human glycogenolysis enzymes including PYGL and G6PC result in glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), marked hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, and development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas, the role of glycogen metabolism in tumorigenesis has been less appreciated ( Bianchi, 1993 7.

Recent studies have shown that biological events in cells are spatiotemporally regulated via the distinct subcompartments including membraneless biomolecular condensates such as liquid-like droplets of condensed nucleic acids, proteins, and other biomolecules through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) ( Alberti et al., 2019 2.

Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2171) PubMed Google Scholar ). The dynamic exchange of phase components in condensed liquid-like droplets with the surrounding molecules in a living cell occurs all the time. Biomolecular condensate as an organizational hub is essential for molecular sequestration or assembly and biological reaction ( Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 66. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glycogen is a large, branched polymer of glucose, which comprises up to 120,000 glucose residues and is shown to regulate cytosolic viscosity ( Persson et al., 2020 56. Persson, L.B. ∙ Ambati, V.S. ∙ Brandman, O. Cellular Control of Viscosity Counters Changes in Temperature and Energy Availability Cell. 2020; 183 :1572-1585.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether glycogen condensates can undergo phase separation to both facilitate and respond to biological function and how their metastability may underlie devastating glycogen aggregation diseases remain unclear.
In this study, we demonstrated a critical role of glycogen storage in tumor initiation. We found that glycogen accumulation is commonly present in the early stage of human and mouse liver tumors and essential for tumor initiation. Elimination of glycogen accumulation abrogates liver cancer incidence, whereas increasing glycogen storage accelerates tumorigenesis. Inactivation of the oncoprotein Yap by the Hippo/Mst1/2 pathway emerges as a critical tumor suppression mechanism ( Harvey et al., 2013 29. Harvey, K.F. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Thomas, D.M.

Zheng, Y. ∙ Pan, D. The Hippo Signaling Pathway in Development and Disease Dev. Cell. 2019; 50 :264-282 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar ). We revealed that accumulated glycogen undergoes LLPS, which leads to the assembly of the Laforin-Mst1/2 complex in glycogen liquid droplets and consequently activates Yap for cell survival and transformation. Moreover, G6PC or PYGL, glycogenolysis enzymes, deficiency in both human and mice results in GSDs associated with Yap activation, enlarged liver size, and cancer development, phenocopying Hippo signaling deficiency. Thus, our study provides mechanistic and functional insights into the unseen effect of increasing glycogen storage during the process of tumor initiation and therefore has important clinical implications for cancer early detection and treatment.

Section: Results

The body absorbs and converts carbohydrates into glucose, which can be stored in cells as glycogen for later use. Interestingly, we observed that the condensed glycogen lesions were associated with small but not with large tumors from diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated mice at 9 months of age ( Figures 1 A and S1 A), while no glycogen-rich lesions can be seen in the liver of control mice at the same age ( Figure 1 B). Some larger tumors showed even lower glycogen content as compared with adjacent normal tissue ( Figure 1 A). Quantification of glycogen levels in the liver sections of different tumor size between 0 and 6 mm in diameter as judged by a series of continuous section revealed that smaller size tumors had significantly more glycogen storage, whereas larger size tumors exhibited lower glycogen content as compared to adjacent tissues ( Figure 1 C). Similarly, in human liver tumor sections, the condensed glycogen staining was also widely observed in small nodules but seldom found in larger tumors ( Figure 1 D). We also assessed the glycogen levels of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples in the different tumor/node/metastasis classification system (TNM) stages with paired adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Despite the high variability between individuals, in most cases, glycogen content was increased in the stage I (early stage) but dramatically reduced in the later stages (stage II, stage III, and stage IV) of human HCCs as compared with adjacent normal tissues ( Figure 1 E). DEN-treatment usually results in HCC development at an age of 9–10 months. We then determined if condensed glycogen lesions are also present in the livers from younger DEN-treated mice (at 7 months of age), in which no tumor nodule was observed on liver surface. The result showed that the distribution of condensed glycogen foci was scattered and correlated with AFP positive cell groups in these liver sections ( Figures 1 F and S1 A), suggesting that glycogen was accumulated in hepatic early malignant lesions. Similar phenomenon was also observed in LSL-Kras G12D Alb -Cre mice at 10 months of age, in which a conditionally activated allele for Kras G12D in liver led to tumor development on liver surface at an age of 13–15 months ( Figures 1 G and S1 B). Moreover, activating CTNNB1 mutations (S33A/S37A/T41A/S45A) commonly occur in human HCC, although these mutations alone do not induce liver cancer. Myc overexpression or Akt activation are also evident in most HCCs ( Whittaker et al., 2010 80. Whittaker, S. ∙ Marais, R. ∙ Zhu, A.X. The role of signaling pathways in the development and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma Oncogene. 2010; 29 :4989-5005 Crossref Scopus (740) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether the glycogen accumulation is associated with those oncogenic initiation, wild-type mice were challenged by hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) injection of Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase vector encoding liver primary mutagenic drivers CTNNB1, Myc, myr-Akt, or their combinations to induce hepatic neoplasms ( Figures S1 C and S1D). Similarly, activated CTNNB1 with either Myc or myr-Akt concurrence promoted the formation of glycogen-rich pre-malignant lesion within 5 weeks post HTV injection ( Figures 1 H and 1I). pSB- Myc alone also induced glycogen-rich tumor lesions in the livers of 8-month-old mice ( Figures 1 J and S1 E). Taken together, these results suggest that glycogen accumulation is commonly present in the early stage of both mouse and human liver tumors and might play an important role in tumor initiation.
To obtain a better understanding of mechanisms that promote glycogen accumulation at the early stage of liver tumor, an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) assay was performed with early/small pre-malignant lesions (high glycogen levels) and normal adjacent liver tissues (normal glycogen levels) from DEN-treated mice using the Millisect System ( Figure 2 A). Comparison of the expression levels of genes involved in glycogen catabolism and anabolism revealed that only G6pc , encoding the last step enzyme of glycogenolysis, was significantly decreased in pre-malignant lesions, whereas there was no consistent change of other genes involved in glycogenosis and glycogenolysis ( Figures 2 B and 2C). G6PC expression can be downregulated by insulin/Akt signaling ( Nehrbass et al., 1998 49. Nehrbass, D. ∙ Klimek, F. ∙ Bannasch, P. Overexpression of insulin receptor substrate-1 emerges early in hepatocarcinogenesis and elicits preneoplastic hepatic glycogenosis Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152 :341-345 PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis confirmed that G6PC expression was downregulated while phospho-Akt (p-Akt) level was increased in hepatic early malignant lesions with accumulated glycogen from either DEN-treated, LSL-Kras G12D Alb -Cre, or HTV pSB -Myc mice ( Figure 2 D). In addition, G6PC deficiency in both human and mice results in glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD1a) ( Chou et al., 2010 15. Chou, J.Y. ∙ Jun, H.S. ∙ Mansfield, B.C. Glycogen storage disease type I and G6Pase-β deficiency: etiology and therapy Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2010; 6 :676-688 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mutel et al., 2011 48.

Development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in mice with liver-specific G6Pase-α deficiency Dis. Model. Mech. 2014; 7 :1083-1091 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we conclude that downregulation of G6PC might be responsible for increased glycogen storage during tumor initiation.
To investigate the effects of G6PC on hepatic glycogen homeostasis, we generated the liver-specific G6pc knockout ( G6pc ΔAlb ) mice by crossing G6pc fl/fl mice with Alb -Cre mice ( Figures S2 A–S2C). As expected, higher glycogen storage was observed in the livers from G6pc ΔAlb mice compared with that of their wild-type littermates G6pc fl/fl mice ( Figure S2 D). G6pc ΔAlb mice also exhibited enlarged liver size, increased liver/body weight ratios and higher percentage of Ki67 + proliferating liver cells ( Figures 2 E and S2 E), which resembled a Hippo-signaling-deficient phenotype ( Camargo et al., 2007 12.

Mst1 and Mst2 maintain hepatocyte quiescence and suppress hepatocellular carcinoma development through inactivation of the Yap1 oncogene Cancer Cell. 2009; 16 :425-438 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, loss of G6PC in hepatocytes led to greatly reduced Hippo kinases Mst1 and Mst2 (Mst1/2) activities as shown by the decreased phosphorylation levels of Mob1 (p-Mob1), a physiological substrate of Mst1/2, and enhanced their downstream effector Yap activities as shown by decreased phosphorylation levels and increased its nuclear localization and target gene expression ( Ctgf and Cyr61 ) ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S2 F). Importantly, inactivation of one allele of Yap was sufficient to reduce liver enlargement in G6pc ΔAlb mice ( Figure 2 H). Moreover, RNA-seq analysis revealed that Yap downstream targets were also increased in the early (small) tumor lesions with accumulated glycogen as compared to adjacent normal tissues from DEN-treated mice, which were further validated by RNA in situ hybridization ( Figures 2 I, 2J, S2 G and S2H). To sort out whether the liver enlargement and Hippo signaling inactivation merely resulted from the glycogen accumulation in liver cells, but not due to other metabolic disorders caused by G6PC deficiency, we generated conditional Pygl knockout mice, in which the exon 4 of Pygl , a gene encoding liver glycogen phosphorylase enzyme to break down glycogen, was flanked by loxP sites ( Pygl fl/fl , Figures S2 I–S2K), and crossed them with Alb -Cre mice to obtain the liver-specific Pygl knockout animals ( Pygl ΔAlb ). As expected, Pygl ΔAlb mice exhibited glycogen accumulation in the liver ( Figure S2 L), as well as enlarged liver size and increased Ki67 + liver cells ( Figures 2 K and S2 M). Similarly, downregulation of Hippo signaling was also found in PYGL-deficient liver ( Figures 2 L, 2M, and S2 N). In addition, decreased p-Mob1 and p-Yap levels were also found in HepG2 cells overexpressing constitutively active glycogen synthase Gys2(CA), which results in glycogen accumulation in cells, named as HepG2 Gys2 ( Figures 2 N–2P). Similarly, the increased nuclear translocation of Yap was found in the liver of patients with GSD1a when compared with that of normal liver ( Figure 2 Q). These results suggest that glycogen accumulation blocks Hippo signaling activities and consequently activates Yap, which promotes liver enlargement and cancer development.
Interestingly, we found that Mst1/2 aggregates formed as multiple distributed foci in glycogen-accumulated liver tissues from either G6pc ΔAlb or Pygl ΔAlb mice but not in the wild-type liver ( Figures S3 A and S3B). We next sought to determine how the glycogen accumulation affects Mst1 subcellular location. Since protein Stbd1 is exclusively bound to glycogen, Stbd1 antibody is commonly used to label glycogen ( Jiang et al., 2010 33. Jiang, S. ∙ Heller, B. ∙ Tagliabracci, V.S. ... Starch binding domain-containing protein 1/genethonin 1 is a novel participant in glycogen metabolism J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 :34960-34971 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). The immunofluorescent double staining with anti-Mst1 and anti-Stbd1 showed that Mst1/2-glycogen formed aggregate foci in glycogen-accumulated liver tissues ( Figures 3 A and S3 C). We isolated glycogen from mouse liver and performed proteomic analysis of the glycogen compartment. The result showed that Mst1 and Mst2, but not other major components of the Hippo pathway, such as Merlin, WW45, Lats1/2, and Yap, were present in the glycogen pellet fraction, which was further validated by western blot analysis ( Figure 3 B; Table S1 ). Similarly, Mst1/2-glycogen aggregate foci were observed in glycogen-accumulated tumor nodules from DEN-treated or human HCC patients but not in normal mouse or human liver tissues ( Figures 3 C–3E). To visualize the formation of Mst1/2-glycogen aggregate foci in live cells, HepG2 Gys2 cells were co-transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-conjugated carbohydrate binding domain of Stbd1 (CBM20-GFP). The immunofluorescent staining assay showed that Mst1 was co-localized with glycogen foci, indicating that Mst1/2-glycogen formed aggregate foci in HepG2 Gys2 cells ( Figure 3 F).
To exclude the possible role for the CBM20-GFP protein or Stbd1 antibody labeling in the stabilization of these glycogen aggregate structures or promoting glycogen clustering, we used a fluorescent derivative of D-glucose (2-NBDG) as a substitute of glucose competitively integrated to form glycogen in live cells. We found that, on average, glycogen droplet diameter exhibited similar size at the same induction time point in HepG2 Gys2 cells labeled by 2-NBDG or by CBM20-GFP, and the sizes of glycogen droplet by their labeling depend on the induction time points of Gys2-mediated glycogen synthesis refed with glucose after 12 h of glucose starvation ( Figure S3 D), suggesting that these glycogen aggregate structures are formed spontaneously rather than stabilized by CBM20-GFP protein.
To further confirm that Mst1 can form aggregates or foci in other glycogen-accumulated cell types, we examined two human melanoma cell lines, A375 and MeWo, containing normal level glycogen and extremely high-level glycogen, respectively ( Rousset et al., 1981 63. Rousset, M. ∙ Zweibaum, A. ∙ Fogh, J. Presence of glycogen and growth-related variations in 58 cultured human tumor cell lines of various tissue origins Cancer Res. 1981; 41 :1165-1170 PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, the result showed that Mst1-glycogen aggregates formed as multiple foci only in higher glycogen MeWo cells but not in low glycogen A375 cells ( Figures 3 G and S3 E). In addition, about 8-fold higher mRNA levels of Yap target genes CTGF and CYR61 were found in MeWo cells than that in A375 cells, indicating the correlation of inhibition of Hippo signaling with high level of glycogen content ( Figure 3 H). Taken together, these data suggest that accumulated glycogen triggers the formation of glycogen-Mst1/2 aggregate foci to block Hippo signaling activities in cells.
Glycogen is a large, branched polymer of glucose. Previous studies showed that polymer blends or bimolecular condensates can undergo phase separation ( Alberti et al., 2019 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T. Considerations and Challenges in Studying Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Biomolecular Condensates Cell. 2019; 176 :419-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1507) PubMed Google Scholar ; McSwiggen et al., 2019 44. McSwiggen, D.T. ∙ Mir, M. ∙ Darzacq, X. ... Evaluating phase separation in live cells: diagnosis, caveats, and functional consequences Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :1619-1634 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether glycogen undergoes phase-separation in vitro , we made glycogen solutions at a range of concentrations in salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, PH7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 4 mM glucose) and performed differential interference contrast (DIC) or fluorescence microscopy analysis. The glycogen solution became turbid at a concentration higher than 10 g/L at room temperature (RT). Interestingly, when temperature was increased to 37°C, the physiological temperature, the turbidity appeared in the glycogen solution at a concentration of 5 g/L, which is clarified at RT or 4°C. DIC or fluorescence microscopy showed that numerous spherical droplets exhibited phase-separation from these opalescent solutions ( Figures 4 A and 4B). An increased glycogen concentration or temperature led to increased number and larger size of glycogen spheres ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Smaller droplets coalesced into larger droplets over time ( Figures 4 C and S4 A), and the fluorescent signal recovered after photobleaching (FRAP) in minutes ( Figure 4 D), both of which are consistent with liquid-like properties. To mimic intracellular crowing condition, glycogen droplet formation was monitored with Polyethylenglycol 8000 (PEG 8000) buffer at various concentrations. We observed that glycogen formed liquid droplets when the concentration of glycogen exceeded 4 g/L in a 3% PEG 8000 buffer ( Figure S4 B). At low glycogen concentrations or in a buffer without PEG 8000, the glycogen solutions were clear. In contrast, they were opalescent at high glycogen concentrations or with a 3% PEG 8000 buffer. The DIC and fluorescence imaging revealed that these droplets were dynamic: droplets fused with each other creating larger droplets over time and the fluorescence signal recovered rapidly after photobleaching ( Figures S4 C–S4E). Taken together, these data suggested the condensed glycogen can undergo LLPS in vitro .
We next sought to determine whether accumulated glycogen undergoes LLPS within a cell. As we expected, the formation of glycogen liquid droplets was also clearly visualized in HepG2 Gys2 cells by using CBM20-GFP ( Figures 4 E and 4F). These glycogen granules were spherical ( Figure S4 F). Smaller glycogen droplets tended to coalesce into a larger droplet ( Figure 4 G; Video S1 ) or larger glycogen droplets were split into smaller droplets over time ( Figure 4 H), indicating that these liquid bodies are able to fuse or separate in vivo . The fluorescent signal of CBM20-GFP labeled glycogen can be recovered after photobleaching in seconds ( Figure 4 I; Video S2 ) in HepG2 Gys2 cells. These results indicate that the high-level intracellular glycogen spontaneously undergoes LLPS.

We have shown that condensed glycogen induces the formation of Mst1/2-glycogen aggregate foci in cells and blocks Hippo signaling activity ( Figures 2 N and 3 F). To validate that Mst1/2 were retained in condensed glycogen compartments through liquid phase separation of glycogen, we analyzed Mst1 location in glycogen-rich MeWo cells treated with 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HD), an agent known to compromise the glycogen LLPS without changing glycogen content. The results clearly demonstrate that disruption of glycogen LLPS resulted in the dissociation of the Mst1-glycogen droplet and restored the activity of Hippo/Mst1/2 signaling as shown by increased p-Mob1 and p-Yap in MeWo cells upon 1,6-HD treatment, indicating that Mst1/2 localization and Yap activation relied on glycogen LLPS in the MeWo cells ( Figures 5 A and 5B). We next sought to determine how Mst1/2 can be recruited to glycogen droplets. Mst1/2 were co-pulled down in the glycogen pellet purified from the mouse liver tissues ( Figure 3 B); however neither Mst1 nor Mst2 could associate with protease K-pretreated glycogen isolated from liver, indicating that additional protein factors are required for retaining Mst1/2 in the glycogen phase ( Figure 5 C). To identify the potential binding partners of Mst1/2 in the glycogen compartment, a series of immunoprecipitation assays were performed with anti-Flag antibodies in 293T cells co-transfected with HA-tagged Mst1 and various Flag-tagged protein candidates, which have been previously reported to interact with glycogen ( Fong et al., 2000 23. Fong, N.M. ∙ Jensen, T.C. ∙ Shah, A.S. ... Identification of binding sites on protein targeting to glycogen for enzymes of glycogen metabolism J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :35034-35039 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stapleton et al., 2013 69. Stapleton, D. ∙ Nelson, C. ∙ Parsawar, K. ...

Analysis of hepatic glycogen-associated proteins Proteomics. 2010; 10 :2320-2329 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S5 A). Among the screened candidates, Laforin was found to strongly interact with Mst1. Indeed, the protein levels of Mst1 coprecipitated in protease-pre-treated glycogen exhibited a Laforin dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5 D) and endogenous Laforin can be co-precipitated with Mst1 in 293T cells ( Figure 5 E). In vitro phase separation assays with different combination of fluorescence-labeled glycogen, Laforin, and Mst1 showed that Laforin is required for Mst1 retention in the glycogen droplet ( Figure 5 F). The co-localization of Laforin and Mst1 in the glycogen liquid droplets was also observed in HepG2 Gys2 cells co-expressing the blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-tagged Laforin and mCherry-tagged Mst1 ( Figure 5 G). The fluorescent signal of BFP-tagged Laforin and mCherry-tagged Mst1 recovered after bleaching in seconds, suggesting that Mst1 and Laforin undergo LLPS with glycogen ( Figures S5 B and S5C; Videos S3 and S4 ). In addition, Laforin is required for the recruitment of Mst1 to glycogen droplets in vivo . Knockdown of Laforin resulted in the disassociation of Mst1 from glycogen aggregate foci in HepG2 Gys2 cells ( Figure 5 H). These results suggest that Laforin might facilitate the association of Mst1/2 with the glycogen droplet.

RNA-seq and qPCR analysis showed that either Epm2a (Laforin) or Epm2b (Malin) expression is intact in G6pc ΔAlb liver ( Figure S5 D) and glycogen-accumulated lesion ( Figure S5 E). Knocking out of Epm2a in G6pc ΔAlb liver using AAV- Epm2a guide RNA (gRNA) resulted in the release of Mst1/2 from glycogen aggregate foci ( Figure 5 I), thereby restoring Mst1/2 kinase activities and decreasing Yap nuclear localization and Ki67 + cells ratio in G6pc ΔAlb liver ( Figures 5 J–5L and S5 F). Moreover, overexpression of Gys2(CA) in Laforin-positive cell lines, such as HepG2, HeLa, SW620, and HEK293T, resulted in inhibition of Hippo signaling, whereas overexpression of Gys2(CA) in Laforin-negative cell lines Bel-7404 and RD did not block Hippo signaling ( Figures 2 N–2P, 6 A, and S6 A–S6D). Importantly, reintroduction of Laforin expression in Bel-7404 and RD cells can restore the inhibitory effect on Hippo signaling by accumulated glycogen ( Figures 6 B–6E and S6 E–S6H). Mechanistically, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal 326 amino acids of Mst1 (i.e., kinase domain) interacted with C-terminal 124–331 amino acids of Laforin to form the complex. Mst1 and Mst2 share identical N-terminal 326 amino acid kinase domains for catalysis, suggesting that Laforin interacts with Mst2 in a similar manner. In addition, transfection of C-terminal 124–331 amino acids of Laforin abrogated the inhibitory effect on Hippo/Mst1/2 signaling by Gys2 overexpression ( Figures 6 F–6I). To ensure that Laforin-mediated inhibition of Hippo signaling is glycogen LLPS-dependent, we analyzed Hippo/Mst1/2 signaling activity in human hepatoma Bel-7404 and rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells overexpressing both Laforin and Gys2 treated with or without 1,6-HD ( Figures 6 B–6E and S6 E–S6H) and found that disruption of glycogen LLPS could restore the activity of Hippo/Mst1/2 signaling. Thus, Laforin is essential for accumulated glycogen-mediated suppression of Hippo/Mst1/2 signaling.
As we showed earlier, only Mst1 and Mst2, but not other major components of the Hippo pathway, such as WW45, Lats1/2, and Yap, were present in the glycogen pellet fraction ( Figure 3 B). WW45 is an essential scaffold adaptor of Mst1/2 for the downstream signaling and also acts as key positive regulator of kinases Mst1/2 ( Tapon et al., 2002 74. Tapon, N. ∙ Harvey, K.F. ∙ Bell, D.W. ... salvador Promotes both cell cycle exit and apoptosis in Drosophila and is mutated in human cancer cell lines Cell. 2002; 110 :467-478 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Udan et al., 2003 75.

We next determined the subcellular location patterns of Mst1 and WW45 in G6pc ΔAlb and Pygl ΔAlb livers and their wild-type counterparts using immunofluorescent staining assays. Notably, Mst1, but not WW45, was found in foci in glycogen storage livers of G6pc ΔAlb and Pygl ΔAlb mice ( Figures 6 J and S6 I). Moreover, in the presence of glycogen, Laforin efficiently disrupts the complex of Mst1/2-WW45 though competing with WW45, although the association between Laforin and Mst1/2 are glycogen-independent ( Figures 6 K and 6L). Taken together, these results suggest that glycogen LLPS leads to the assembly of the Laforin-Mst1/2 complex in glycogen liquid droplet and consequently disrupts the complex of WW45-Mst1/2 to activate Yap for cell survival and transformation.
Our previous genetic study demonstrated that both Mst1 −/− Mst2 +/− and Mst1 +/− Mst2 −/− mice were viable and showed no developmental anomalies, while the Mst1 −/− Mst2 −/− double knockout genotype resulted in embryonic lethality at day 8.5 (E8.5), indicating that Mst1 and Mst2 are redundant kinases, and one allele remaining of Mst1 or Mst2 is sufficient to support normal phenotype ( Zhou et al., 2009 89. Zhou, D. ∙ Conrad, C. ∙ Xia, F. ... Mst1 and Mst2 maintain hepatocyte quiescence and suppress hepatocellular carcinoma development through inactivation of the Yap1 oncogene Cancer Cell. 2009; 16 :425-438 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we speculated that as long as Mst1/2 is not completely trapped in glycogen liquid droplet where Mst1/2 became inactive in G6pc deficient cells, the remaining “free” Mst1/2 outside glycogen liquid droplet could still interact with WW45 to retard Yap activation. As the glycogen aggregates are dynamic, Mst1/2 are likely dynamically cycling between the glycogen droplet and the cytoplasm where it can interact with WW45, resulting in competition among glycogen aggregates and WW45 for interaction with Mst1/2. Therefore, we can shift the dynamics by altering the levels of glycogen or WW45. As we have shown that dissociating glycogen aggregate enhances Mst1/2 to associate with WW45 to restrict Yap, more Mst1/2 is expected to shift to the glycogen aggregates if glycogen content is increased or WW45 is absent, resulting in more complete inhibition of Mst1/2 activity. Consistently, G6pc deletion-mediated glycogen storage partially inactivates Mst1/2 (due to the presence of WW45 to compete with glycogen aggregates for association to inhibit Yap) and thereby showed milder phenotype as compared with Mst1/2 double knockout. WW45 is a critical activator of kinases Mst1/2 in the liver ( Ji et al., 2019 32. Ji, S. ∙ Liu, Q. ∙ Zhang, S. ... FGF15 Activates Hippo Signaling to Suppress Bile Acid Metabolism and Liver Tumorigenesis Dev. Cell. 2019; 48 :460-474.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) but is excluded from aggregated glycogen droplets. Therefore, as long as Mst1/2 is not completely trapped and inactivated by glycogen liquid droplet, WW45 could activate the remaining Mst1/2 to inhibit Yap activation. Indeed, compared with G6pc ΔAlb or Ww45 ΔAlb littermates, liver-specific G6pc and Ww45 double deletion mice ( G6pc ΔAlb Ww45 ΔAlb ) had considerably diminished Yap and Mob1 phosphorylation, more condensed nuclear Yap, and more Ki67 + cells ( Figures 7 A, 7B, S7 A, and S7B). Compared with G6pc fl/fl Ww45 fl/fl , Ww45 ΔAlb , and G6pc ΔAlb mice, G6pc ΔAlb Ww45 ΔAlb mice also exhibited significantly increased liver/body weight ratios at 3 months of age and greatly accelerated liver tumor formation at 6 months of age ( Figures 7 C and S7 C), phenocopying Mst1/2 ΔAlb mice in which HCCs were developed at an age of 5–6 months ( Zhou et al., 2009 89. Zhou, D. ∙ Conrad, C. ∙ Xia, F. ... Mst1 and Mst2 maintain hepatocyte quiescence and suppress hepatocellular carcinoma development through inactivation of the Yap1 oncogene Cancer Cell. 2009; 16 :425-438 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, we found that about 30% of G6pc ΔAlb mice developed hepatic adenoma at an age of 15–17 months and about half of them developed hepatocellular carcinoma at an age of 20 months ( Figures S7 D and S7E), while all Ww45 ΔAlb mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma at an age of 13–15 months ( Ji et al., 2019 32. Ji, S. ∙ Liu, Q. ∙ Zhang, S. ... FGF15 Activates Hippo Signaling to Suppress Bile Acid Metabolism and Liver Tumorigenesis Dev. Cell. 2019; 48 :460-474.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2010 41. Lu, L. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Kim, S.M. ... Hippo signaling is a potent in vivo growth and tumor suppressor pathway in the mammalian liver Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :1437-1442 Crossref Scopus (608) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, knocking out one allele of Yap in G6pc ΔAlb Ww45 ΔAlb mice ( G6pc ΔAlb Ww45 ΔAlb Yap +/fl ) significantly decreased Ki67 + cells ( Figures 7 D and S7 F) and abrogated the liver overgrowth and tumorigenesis phenotype without changing glycogen content ( Figures 7 E and S7 G) indicating that Yap is a critical effector downstream of glycogen and WW45 signaling. Valproic acid (VPA) administration caused a profound reduction in liver glycogen stores ( Beger et al., 2009 6. Beger, R.D. ∙ Hansen, D.K. ∙ Schnackenberg, L.K. ... Single valproic acid treatment inhibits glycogen and RNA ribose turnover while disrupting glucose-derived cholesterol synthesis in liver as revealed by the [U-C(6)]-d-glucose tracer in mice Metabolomics. 2009; 5 :336-345 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is consistent with our results of a decrease in liver glycogen post VPA administration ( Figures S7 H and S7I). We found that G6pc ΔAlb Ww45 ΔAlb mice received VPA administration beginning at 1 month of age exhibited significantly reduced liver/body weight ratios at 3 months of age and greatly abrogated liver tumor formation at 6 months of age ( Figure 7 F). Given that VPA has other cellular targets, we next sought to prove that downregulation of glycogen storage suppresses tumorigenesis by deleting glycogen synthase Gys2 gene. Consistently, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver specific Gys2 gene deletion resulted in educed liver enlargement and attenuated tumor formation in G6pc ΔAlb Ww45 ΔAlb mice ( Figure 7 G), in which the deletion of Gys2 and decreasing of glycogen were confirmed by immunoblotting or immunofluorescent or PAS staining ( Figures S7 J–S7L). In contrast, reduced glycogen content in the livers by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Gys2 gene deletion did not change the severity of Mst1/2-deficency-driven liver overgrowth and tumorigenesis ( Figures 7 H and S7 M), suggesting that condensed glycogen is one of the upstream regulatory factors to restrain Mst1/2 kinase activation for liver oncogenic transformation. These results indicate that WW45 and suppressing glycogen storage signals orchestrate Hippo/Mst1/2 signaling to prevent liver enlargement and tumorigenesis.
Similarly, the liver-specific G6pc deficiency promotes liver tumorigenesis in the DEN-treated mice ( Figure S7 N) or LSL-KrasG12D mutant mice ( Figure S7 O). To further determine the effect of glycogen storage on DEN-driven liver tumorigenesis, we challenged DEN-pretreated mice with either VPA administration beginning at 1 month of age or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Gys2 gene deletion at 1 month of age ( Figures S7 P and S7Q) and found that reduced glycogen storage dramatically retarded DEN-driven liver tumorigenesis ( Figures 7 I, 7J, and S7 R). Thus, we conclude that accumulated glycogen storage could promote tumor incidence.

Section: Discussion

Cancer cells alter metabolic modes to improve their survival and become invasive ( Cairns et al., 2011 11. Cairns, R.A. ∙ Harris, I.S. ∙ Mak, T.W. Regulation of cancer cell metabolism Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11 :85-95 Crossref Scopus (3926) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pavlova and Thompson, 2016 53. Pavlova, N.N. ∙ Thompson, C.B. The Emerging Hallmarks of Cancer Metabolism Cell Metab. 2016; 23 :27-47 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3821) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we report that glycogen storage is an important oncogenic driver and likely a common metabolic feature of liver initially transformed cells. Accumulated glycogen undergoes LLPS to block Hippo signaling through glycogen phase separation to augment tumor initiation. Thus, we concluded that glycogen not only provides nutrition and energy to the cells but also functions as a key initiating oncogenic metabolite.
As the largest macromolecule in the cytosol, glycogen is stored primarily in the liver and muscle cells for energy reserves in mammals. In the current study, we could visualize the formation of glycogen liquid droplets in live cells using either 2-NBDG or CBM20-GFP labeling. Different labeling methods might somehow affect the stabilization of these glycogen aggregate structures or even promote glycogen clustering. Moreover, 2-NBDG acts as a fluorescent derivative of glucose to compete with glucose to integrate into glycogen, which might lead to partially and incompletely labeling all glycogen. However, although various glycogen labeling approaches are different/flawed and might not exclude other explanations, we found that glycogen could spontaneously coalesce into micrometer- or submicrometer-sized clusters to undergo LLPS when glycogen is accumulated in a cell. Glycogen phase separation creates a distinct physical and biochemical compartment that triggers the assembly of the Laforin-Mst1/2 complex in glycogen liquid droplet and inactivates Mst1/2, consequently activating Yap for cell survival and growth. Many human tumor cell lines originating from tissues, which do not normally store glycogen, have been shown to exhibit glycogen accumulation under stress conditions ( Zois and Harris, 2016 90. Zois, C.E. ∙ Harris, A.L. Glycogen metabolism has a key role in the cancer microenvironment and provides new targets for cancer therapy J. Mol. Med. (Berl.). 2016; 94 :137-154 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). It will be of interest to determine whether those cancer lines also exhibit glycogen condensates (i.e., Mst1-glycogen aggregate foci) upon stress-induced glycogen accumulation. A recent study showed that AMPK not only senses the status of AMP/ATP but also monitors the cellular availability of energy reserves in the form of glycogen ( McBride et al., 2009 43. McBride, A. ∙ Ghilagaber, S. ∙ Nikolaev, A. ... The glycogen-binding domain on the AMPK beta subunit allows the kinase to act as a glycogen sensor Cell Metab. 2009; 9 :23-34 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glucose metabolic stress induced kinase AMPK activation, which turns on kinases Lats1/2 to phosphorylate Yap and inhibit its cellular functions ( Mo et al., 2015 45. Mo, J.S. ∙ Meng, Z. ∙ Kim, Y.C. ... Cellular energy stress induces AMPK-mediated regulation of YAP and the Hippo pathway Nat.

AMPK modulates Hippo pathway activity to regulate energy homeostasis Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :490-499 Crossref Scopus (414) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we found that liver primary mutagenic drivers such as CTNNB1, Myc, Akt, K-Ras, or their combination-induced oncogenic transformation also exhibits increased glycogen storage phenotype, indicating that malignant transformation of a cell might require glycogen accumulation during the process of tumor initiation. Yap has been shown to act as a key downstream player or positive regulator of CTNNB1, Myc, Akt, and K-Ras ( Azzolin et al., 2014 4. Azzolin, L. ∙ Panciera, T. ∙ Soligo, S. ...

Therefore, we speculate that Yap could be one of major effectors of glycogen storage and phase separation. In addition, high levels of glucose are shown to induce Yap protein O-GlcNAcylation and activation ( Peng et al., 2017 55. Peng, C. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ Zhang, W. ... Regulation of the Hippo-YAP Pathway by Glucose Sensor O-GlcNAcylation Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :591-604.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculated that glycogen breakdown or increased glucose uptake in advanced tumor cells might lead to significantly raised intracellular glucose concentrations and thereby promotes Yap O-GlcNAcylation and activation for tumor progression. Thus, Yap could be activated for both tumor initiation and maintenance through different mechanisms.
Advanced tumor cell growth rate has an inverse correlation with glycogen content in a cell ( Rousset et al., 1981 63. Rousset, M. ∙ Zweibaum, A. ∙ Fogh, J. Presence of glycogen and growth-related variations in 58 cultured human tumor cell lines of various tissue origins Cancer Res. 1981; 41 :1165-1170 PubMed Google Scholar ) and restrained glycogenolysis results in reduced glucose oxidation, thereby retarding cancer cell growth ( Favaro et al., 2012 21.

Cancer. 2004; 91 :2094-2100 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). All those studies were conducted using cancer cell lines rather than cells or tissues at the early stages of transformation. Since proliferating cancer cells increase their glucose consumption toward aerobic glycolysis to promote growth, it is not surprising to observe that cancer cell lines adapt glycogen catabolic pathway toward aerobic glycolysis. Consistently, we found that glycogen content in the later stages of cancer was much less as compared to adjacent normal tissue, confirming that glycogen breakdown is important for tumor growth at an advanced stage. Furthermore, it has been shown that glycogen is accumulated to improve several types of cancer cell survival in response to nutrient stress ( Altemus et al., 2019 3.

Dis. 2005; 28 :153-162 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, some of human renal clear cell carcinoma also exhibited glycogen storing state ( Kaelin, 2009 34. Kaelin, Jr., W.G. Treatment of kidney cancer: insights provided by the VHL tumor-suppressor protein Cancer. 2009; 115 :2262-2272 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steinberg et al., 1992 70. Steinberg, P. ∙ Störkel, S. ∙ Oesch, F. ... Carbohydrate metabolism in human renal clear cell carcinomas Lab. Invest. 1992; 67 :506-511 PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, cancer cells alter their glycogen metabolism (i.e., glycogen storage or breakdown) to sustain survival and growth according to the stages of cancer progression and tumor microenvironment. It will be important to elucidate the molecular mechanism regulating glycogen metabolic mode switching for augmenting cancer initiation and progression.
Loss-of-function mutations in either EPM2A (Laforin) or EPM2B (Malin) result in the formation of insoluble and neurotoxic glycogen aggregates also called Lafora bodies (LBs), which eventually cause the Lafora’s disease ( Nitschke et al., 2018 50. Nitschke, F. ∙ Ahonen, S.J. ∙ Nitschke, S. ... Lafora disease - from pathogenesis to treatment strategies Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2018; 14 :606-617 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous studies showed that no LBs were detected in the livers of Epm2a −/− or Epm2b −/− mice until 9 months old, although LBs appeared in the most regions of the brain of Epm2a −/− or Epm2b −/− mice at 2–3 months of age ( DePaoli-Roach et al., 2010 17. DePaoli-Roach, A.A. ∙ Tagliabracci, V.S. ∙ Segvich, D.M. ... Genetic depletion of the malin E3 ubiquitin ligase in mice leads to lafora bodies and the accumulation of insoluble laforin J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 :25372-25381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ganesh et al., 2002 27. Ganesh, S. ∙ Delgado-Escueta, A.V. ∙ Sakamoto, T. ...

Genet. 2002; 11 :1251-1262 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). These Epm2a −/− or Epm2b −/− mutant mice did not display enlarged liver and had no liver cancer incidence, suggesting no significant pathological consequence in the livers upon deletion of Epm2a or Epm2b at least until 9 months of age. LBs are insoluble and have immobilization feature, whereas the glycogen granules (droplets) we detected under conditions of glycogen accumulation in live cells are undergoing LLPS as shown by droplets fusion or FRAP assays. Moreover, our results showed that either Epm2a or Epm2b expression was intact in glycogen-accumulated lesion or in G6pc ΔAlb liver indicating that glycogen condensates in these tissues or cells are not LBs. However, it will be of interest to analyze the components included in soluble and insoluble glycogen aggregates and thereby elucidate the mechanisms resulting in differential pathological consequence.
It is important to explore pre-malignant biomarkers and cancer-initiating mechanisms for early detection of cancer. In this study, we demonstrate a critical role of glycogen storage in tumor initiation. Our findings may provide mechanistic and functional insights into increased glycogen storage at the early stage of cancer. This study also indicates that accumulated glycogen could be a biomarker for early diagnosis as well as prognosis of cancer patients; meanwhile elimination of glycogen could be a potential cancer therapeutic strategy.
In this work, we found that glycogen accumulation is commonly present in the early stage of human and mouse liver tumors and essential for tumor initiation. Several cancer cell lines derived from different tissues have been shown to increase glycogen storage under hypoxic stress ( Zois et al., 2014 91. Zois, C.E. ∙ Favaro, E. ∙ Harris, A.L. Glycogen metabolism in cancer Biochem. Pharmacol. 2014; 92 :3-11 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it remains unknown whether glycogen accumulation occurs during the oncogenic transformation of those normally not storing glycogen tissues and how it promotes tumorigenesis. In addition, we found that the non-metabolic (i.e., signaling) role of glycogen storage in tumor initiation. Accumulated glycogen undergoes LLPS, which leads to the assembly of the Laforin-Mst1/2 complex in glycogen lipid droplets, thereby activating Yap signaling to promote liver oncogenic transformation. Future work will be needed to fully elucidate the molecular basis and underlying mechanisms of increasing glycogen storage during tumor progression. Increasing glycogen storage certainly alters other metabolic signals, which might also play a role in cancer development. It will be important to determine if and how oncogenic mutations or tumor suppressor silencing alter glycogen metabolism. Currently, it is quite challenging to perform the metabolic flux/turnover analysis of glycogen accumulating cells in early tumor lesions since there is no available surface biomarker to label and isolate these tumor cells. Furthermore, tracking the dynamic changes of glycogen in vivo in real time is also a challenge and developing an effective glycogen probe as well as other metabolite monitoring probes in vivo will be much appreciated for better understanding the role of glycogen storage in tumorigenesis.

Briefly, the G6pc floxed allele was constructed by a LoxP sites flanking exon 3 targeting vector, and the Pygl floxed allele was constructed by a LoxP sites flanking exon 4 targeting vector ( Figures S2 A and S2I). Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were transfected with the targeting vectors via electroporation. The correctly targeted ES cell clones confirmed by Southern blot were microinjected to albino C57 mouse blastocysts according to standard protocols. Agouti F1 mice generated by crossing the chimeric mice with C57/BL6 mice were analyzed by Southern hybridization with the 3′ and 5′ external probes to validate germline transmission of the G 6pc or Pygl floxed allele. The genotyping primers are list in Table S2 . All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions at the Xiamen University Laboratory Animal Center. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in strict accordance with good veterinary practice as defined by the Xiamen University Laboratory Animal Center.
2-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were treated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 25 mg/kg in 0.9% saline, Sigma-Aldrich) by intraperitoneal injection to initiate liver tumor formation. Control mice were intraperitoneally injected with 0.9% saline at the same age. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated ages and liver tissues were collected and analyzed.

Cell. 2019; 48 :460-474.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), 4-week-old male or female C57BL/6 mice were hydrodynamic delivered with 100 μg of HA-tagged active CTNNB1 (S33A/S37A/T41A/S45A) plasmid (pSB-HA- CTNNB1 ) combined with Flag-tagged c-Myc plasmid (pSB-Flag- Myc ) or Flag-tagged active Akt plasmid (pSB-Flag-myr- Akt ), or control pSB-GFP plasmids in 2 mL of Ringer’s solutions (147 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.13 mM CaCl 2 ) via tail vein injections within 5 s.
The Gys2 and Epm2a gRNA sequences were synthesized ( Table S2 ). Oligo pairs were annealed and subcloned to a modified pscAAV-GFP vector (Addgene#32396). Generation and delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus was as described in our previous study ( Ji et al., 2019 32. Ji, S. ∙ Liu, Q. ∙ Zhang, S. ... FGF15 Activates Hippo Signaling to Suppress Bile Acid Metabolism and Liver Tumorigenesis Dev. Cell. 2019; 48 :460-474.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with scAAV gRNA or control plasmid, adenovirus helper plasmid PXX6 and AAV8 helper plasmid p5E18-VD28. Cells were harvested 60 h post transfection. After 3 times of freezing and thaw, the crude viruses were released from 293T cells, and then further purified with chloroform treatment and PEG8000-(NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 partition. The fraction containing viruses was dialyzed in PBS and concentrated by Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter. The AAV titer was determined by RT-PCR using primers against the CMV promoter on the AAV vector. For animal infection, one 4-week-old male or female mouse received a tail vein injection of 1x10 11 genome copies of AAV.
4-week-old male or female Ww45 fl/fl G6pc fl/fl and Ww45 ΔAlb G6pc ΔAlb mice or 4-week-old DEN male mice were randomly divided into two groups ( Beger et al., 2009 6. Beger, R.D. ∙ Hansen, D.K. ∙ Schnackenberg, L.K. ... Single valproic acid treatment inhibits glycogen and RNA ribose turnover while disrupting glucose-derived cholesterol synthesis in liver as revealed by the [U-C(6)]-d-glucose tracer in mice Metabolomics. 2009; 5 :336-345 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). One group mice were administered with drinking water containing 3 g/L VPA (ALADDIN) for 2, 5 or 9 months as indicated. The other group of mice was given pure water as the controls. VPA treatment had no significant effect on the daily water consumption of mice. Liver tissues were collected at the indicated age and the liver size, tumor numbers and glycogen content were analyzed.
For PAS staining and immunohistochemistry, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues were obtained with informed consent from the human tissue banks of the Mengchao hepatobiliary hospital of Fujian Medical University or Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital/Institute, Second Military Medical University. HCC specimens were from total 86 patients (75 males and 11 females) with hepatocellular carcinoma at an age range from 27 to 81 years old. The diagnosis and staging of HCC or normal liver tissue (distant from the tumor) was confirmed by independent pathologists. Paraffin-embedded liver specimens of glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD1a) patient were obtained from the Mengchao hepatobiliary hospital of Fujian Medical University. GSD1a samples were from 6 male patients at an age range from 2 to 10 years old. All procedures were performed with the approval of the Xiamen University Review Board.
In the mouse models, all the liver tumors assessed in this manuscript were still within the confines of the normal glands and did not metastasize. Tumor size (assessed by a series of tissue sections) and the onset time points were used to determine mouse liver tumor stage. For human HCC samples, tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) staging system is adapted to compare glycogen content in patients at different stages. Human in situ liver tumors were chosen to be assessed in this study to obtain more consistent data. According to TNM staging system (as referred to https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/staging ), the higher the stage number (stage I, II, III), the larger tumor size and the more that spreading into nearby tissues. The cancer at stage IV has spread to distant parts of the body. Therefore, early-stage cancer generally refers to the size and/or extent (reach) of the original (primary) tumor. The later-stage tumor or the larger tumor has grown into nearby tissues.
The 293T, MeWo, SW620, HeLa, Bel-7404, RD, A375 and HepG2 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, tested negative for mycoplasma contamination, and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 × penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen).

Glycogen was isolated from mouse liver as previously described ( Van Der Vies, 1954 76. Van Der Vies, J. Two methods for the determination of glycogen in liver Biochem. J. 1954; 57 :410-416 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, livers from 8-week-old mice were homogenized in five volumes of 10% TCA buffer (trichloroacetic acid solution, Sangon). Liver homogenates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4ᵒC and the supernatants were collected in a new tube. The equal volume of 95% ethanol was added and followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min. The pellets were dissolved in glycogen isolation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate).
Glycogen was measured as previously described ( Passonneau and Lauderdale, 1974 52. Passonneau, J.V. ∙ Lauderdale, V.R. A comparison of three methods of glycogen measurement in tissues Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60 :405-412 Crossref Scopus (639) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were harvested and boiled with 2M HCl, and then neutralized with 2M NaOH for glycogen measurement. After centrifugation, the glucose levels in the supernatants were measured using Glucose Assay Kit (Sigma, GAGO20). The protein content was measured in the same amount of cells with BCA Kit (Auragene, P001B-2). For measuring glycogen in livers, 20 mg liver tissue (for total glucose) was homogenized with 2M HCl, boiled for 30 min and then neutralized with 2M NaOH, and another 20 mg liver tissue (for free glucose) was homogenized with 2M NaOH, boiled and then neutralized with 2M HCl. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble pellet. The glucose levels in the supernatant were measured with Glucose Assay Kit (Sigma, GAGO20).
Glycogen pull down assay was performed as previously described ( Wu et al., 1998 82. Wu, J. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Thompson, I. ... A conserved domain for glycogen binding in protein phosphatase-1 targeting subunits FEBS Lett. 1998; 439 :185-191 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the purified glycogen was suspended and mixed with indicated protein concentration with constant shaking for 90 min at 4°C in binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Proteins bound to glycogen were isolated by centrifugation at 178 000 × g for 90 min. Following centrifugation and collection of the supernatant, the pellet was washed immediately with 100 μL cold PBS. The glycogen pellet was subjected to Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis for protein identification. In addition, both the supernatant and the pellet were suspended in SDS-PAGE buffer for further western blot analysis.
In the current manuscript, there are four different approaches to label glycogen as described previously ( Curtis et al., 2019 16. Curtis, M. ∙ Kenny, H.A. ∙ Ashcroft, B. ...

Jiang, S. ∙ Heller, B. ∙ Tagliabracci, V.S. ... Starch binding domain-containing protein 1/genethonin 1 is a novel participant in glycogen metabolism J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 :34960-34971 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ): (1) Glycogen was detected with a standardized periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining technique. Briefly, the livers were fixed and then embedded in paraffin. 5 μm liver sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and then incubated in periodic acid solution for 5-10 min at room temperature (RT). After washing with water, liver sections were bathed with Schiff’s reagent for 15 min at RT. After washed with water, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in xylene-based mounting media. Images were obtained using Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope and Motic microscope. To generate high-content and resolution digital images for PAS quantification, liver PAS staining slides were scanned with a Leica Aperio Versa 200. The PAS staining intensity from the image was quantified using ImageJ software ( Schneider et al., 2012 64. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (43974) PubMed Google Scholar ) and normalized with background (PAS staining index). All the PAS stainings had been further confirmed using diastase digestion approach ( Fu and Campbell-Thompson, 2017 26. Fu, D.A. ∙ Campbell-Thompson, M. Periodic Acid-Schiff Staining with Diastase Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1639 :145-149 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). If the PAS positive staining became negative in the parallel slide after diastase digestion indicating the stained material was glycogen. (2) The formation of glycogen liquid droplets was visualized in live cells transfected with the plasmid encoding GFP-conjugated carbohydrate binding domain of Stbd1 (CBM20-GFP) which is exclusively bound to glycogen. (3) Anti-Stbd1 antibody was used to label glycogen in the liver and tumor tissue sections. (4) 2-NBDG, a fluorescent derivative of glucose, was used for glycogen labeling in live cells. 2-NBDG acts as a substitute of glucose competitively integrated to form glycogen in live cells.
As described in our previous study ( Ji et al., 2019 32. Ji, S. ∙ Liu, Q. ∙ Zhang, S. ... FGF15 Activates Hippo Signaling to Suppress Bile Acid Metabolism and Liver Tumorigenesis Dev. Cell. 2019; 48 :460-474.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), the tissue specimens were ðxed for 24 h in 4% PFA and then embedded in paraffin for sectioning. Standard staining with hematoxylin and eosin was performed on 5 μm sections. For immunohistochemistry, liver sections were rehydrated and incubated in 3% H2O2 for 15 min, boiled with citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval and then blocked with 5% horse serum followed by incubating overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies including anti-AFP (1:100, Proteintech, 14550-1-AP), anti-Yap (1:50, Abclonal, A1002), anti-Ki67 (1:100, Cell signaling, 12202), anti-Flag (1:100, Santa Cruz, sc-166355), anti-HA (1:100, Santa Cruz, sc-7392), anti-G6PC (1:100, Abcam, ab83690), anti-p-Akt (1:100, Cell signaling, 4060). After washing with PBS, tissue sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG or biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories) at RT for 30 min and then followed with streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Vector Laboratories) incubation for 30 min. Subsequently, the slides were performed with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine staining (Vector Laboratories) and then counterstained with hematoxylin. The Motic microscope and Motic DSAssistant lite software were used for panoramic scan of immunohistochemistry.
For tissues, the liver sections were deparafðnized and antigen retrieved by citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95°C for 40 min, and then blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies including anti-Mst1(1:200, Proteintech, 22245-1-AP), anti-Mst2 (1:100, homemade), anti-WW45 (1:100, homemade), anti-Yap (1:500, Abclonal, A1002) and anti-β-catenin (1:200; Abcam, AB6301) overnight at 4°C, followed by washing with PBS and incubation with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti–mouse IgG (A21202), Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated anti–rabbit IgG (A21206) or Alexa Fluor 555–conjugated anti–mouse IgG (A31570), all from Invitrogen) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). For cells, 4% PFA fixed cells were rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 4°C, blocked with 0.02% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA in PBS at RT for 30 min, and then incubated with primarily antibodies anti-Mst1 (1:250; Proteintech, 22245-1-AP) at 4°C for 1 h, followed by PBS rinsing and incubating with secondary antibodies for another 1 h. Finally, after three times PBS washing, the cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. All images were collected with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 780).
In vitro phase transition assay was performed as previously described ( Alberti et al., 2018 1. Alberti, S. ∙ Saha, S. ∙ Woodruff, J.B. ... A User’s Guide for Phase Separation Assays with Purified Proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4806-4820 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, glycogen phase transition or droplets formation was performed with varying concentrations of glycogen labeled with FITC-ConA (0.05 mg/mL, Sigma) ( Zhang et al., 2001 86. Zhang, S.Z. ∙ Zhao, F.L. ∙ Li, K.A. ... A study on the interaction between concanavalin A and glycogen by light scattering technique and its analytical application Talanta. 2001; 54 :333-342 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and PEG8000, in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 4mM glucose. A rectangular imaging chamber with two openings on opposite sides was made by attaching a coverslip to the glass slide with two parallel double-sided tapes. Glycogen with or without PEG8000 was mixed in a test tube. The final mixture was transferred to the opening and observed under the microscopy. Images were taken every 5 s for 5 min to visualize droplets formation. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) were performed on glycogen droplets. Briefly, one glycogen droplet was bleached with a spot of 1.5 μm in diameter and the fluorescence recovery was monitored.
HepG2 and HepG2 Gys2(CA) cells transfected with CBM20-GFP were seeded on glass bottom dish (NEST, 801001) and examined with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 780). Cells were incubated to adapt in the observation chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 0.5 h before image acquisition. For 3D version of glycogen in cells, images were taken in z stack with an interval of 0.3 μm. For glycogen fusion and departure events, images were acquired with an interval of 10 s. For fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment, a pulse bleached 70%–80% of the fluorescence in a rectangle region of interest (ROI) of glycogen-GFP, Mst1-mCherry or Laforin-BFP, and the recovery of fluorescence intensity was monitored.
Multiple serial formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (8 μm) were obtained from liver tissues of DEN-treated mice. All the tissue sections were deparaffinized with three five-minute incubations in xylene prior to dissection using the AVENIO Millisect System (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Images from a PAS-stained section were pre-marked to identify areas of normal tissue or high-glycogen small tumors. The dissected tissues from unstained sections were collected and stored in 10 mM Tris buffer with 5% SDS, pH 8.0. The samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm, 4°C, for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded. Total RNA was isolated using a High Pure FFPE RNA Isolation Kit (Roche). RNA quantity was analyzed using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The cDNA libraries were constructed from 0.5 μg RNA sample using an ABclonal Whole RNA-seq Lib Prep kit for illumina (ABclonal, RK20351) following the guidelines of the manufacturers. The concentrations of cDNA libraries were measured using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 instrument (150 bp, paired-end) at Novogene Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Basecalls of millisect RNA-seq data were performed using CASAVA (v.1.8). Purity-filtered reads were trimmed with Cutadapt (v.1.18) (DOI: https://doi.org/10.14806/ej.17.1.200 ). Reads were aligned against the mm10 mouse reference genome using STAR (v.2.5.2b) ( Dobin et al., 2013 18. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27072) PubMed Google Scholar ). The number of read counts per gene locus was summarized with GenomicAlignments (v.1.22.1) ( Lawrence et al., 2013 36. Lawrence, M. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Pagès, H. ... Software for computing and annotating genomic ranges PLoS Comput. Biol. 2013; 9 :e1003118 Crossref Scopus (2370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v.1.24.0) ( Love et al., 2014 40. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48468) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the negative binomial distribution, using default parameters. Significance tests for multiple comparisons were performed by Benjamini & Hochberg correction. Pheatmap (v.1.0.12) ( https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pheatmap/versions/0.2/topics/pheatmap ) was used for the visualization of heatmaps of genes selected according to their functions. Colors represent the fold change values (log2 scale) calculated from the regularized, log2-transformed gene FPKM value obtained from DESeq2 (v.1.24.0). RNA-seq data including raw reads and supplementary files have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number GEO: GSE148933 .
Total RNA of liver tissues or cells were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara). The Real-time quantitative PCR was performed by using SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (Takara) and the Bio-Rad iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Gene expression data were normalized to 18S rRNA. The primer sequences for specific genes are in the Table S2 .
The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to a PVDF membrane and then analyzed by immunoblotting assay with the appropriate antibodies. The primary antibodies, anti-phosphorylated (p-) Mob1 at Thr35 (1:2,000; 8699), anti-Mob1(1:2,000; 13730), anti-Mst1 (1:2,000; 3682), anti-Mst2 (1:2,000; 3952), anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; 5174), anti-Merlin (1:3,000; 12888), anti-Lats1 (1:2,000; 3477), anti-Lats2 (1:2,000; 5888), anti-p-Yap at Ser 127 (1:3,000; 4911) and anti-Flag (1:3,000; 14793) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-HA (1:1000, 51064-2-AP) was from Proteintech. Anti-Yap (1:2,000; A1002) was from Abclonal. Anti-Laforin (1:5,000; ab129110) was from Abcam. Anti-WW45, a polyclonal mouse antibody, was generated by injecting mice with WW45 peptides. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibody (1:3,000) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The protein bands were detected and visualized with NcmECL Ultra according to the product instruction (New Cell & Molecular Biotech).
1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabinitol (DAB) is a protein inhibitor of glycogen synthase phosphorylase which can reduce the amount of glycogen content. 293T cells were treated with 1 mM DAB for 12 h to accumulate glycogen before transfection.
In situ detection of RNA molecules was achieved by using amplification-based single molecule in situ hybridization (asmFISH) method as described in our previous study ( Lin et al., 2021 39. Lin, C. ∙ Jiang, M. ∙ Liu, L. ... Imaging of individual transcripts by amplification-based single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization N. Biotechnol. 2021; 61 :116-123 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections were baked in an oven for half an h at 60°C, followed by deparaffinization in xylene for 15 min and 10 min respectively. Then the slides were dipped into absolute ethanol, 95% and 70%, each twice for 2 min. Next, the slides were submerged in DEPC treated H 2 O (DEPC-H 2 O) for 5 min to rehydrate and washed with 1 × DEPC-PBS for 2 min. The tissue section was then fixed by incubating with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 1 × DEPC-PBS for 10 min and washed with 1 × DEPC-PBS once. The tissue sample was then incubated in 0.1 M HCl containing 0.1 mg/mL pepsin for 30 min at 37°C for permeabilization and then washed with DEPC-H 2 O for 5 min and 1 × DEPC-PBS for 2 min., followed by incubation in 70%, 85% and absolute ethanol for 1 min each to dehydrate. When dry, a Secure-Seal hybridization chamber (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S24732) was attached around the sample for filling the following reaction mixes.
After rinsing once with 1 × DEPC-PBST, a probe hybridization mix containing 0.1 μM of each asmFISH DNA ligation probes (DLPs) (for oligonucleotide sequences, refer to Table S2 ) in 6 × SSC (Sigma-Aldrich, S6639) contained 10% formamide was added to the sample and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After three washes with 1 × DEPC-PBST, a ligation mix containing 0.5 U/μL SplintR DNA Ligase, 1 × SplintR reaction buffer, 0.2 μg/μL BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, B2064), 1 U/μL RiboLock RNase inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific, EO0384) and 50% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, G5516) was added into the chamber and incubated for 30 min to ligate the DLPs. The ligated DLPs were then circularized by T4 ligase mediated DNA ligation. Ligation was achieved by using a ligation mix containing 0.1 U/μL T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EL0011), 0.5 μM of splint oligonucleotide ( Table S2 ), 0.2 μg/μL BSA and 1 U/μL RiboLock RNase inhibitor in 1 × T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Rolling circle amplification was performed in an amplification mix that contains 1 × phi29 DNA polymerase buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EP0094), 1 mM of each dNTPs (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R0182), 1 U/μL phi29 polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EP0094), 1 U/μL RiboLock RNase Inhibitor, 0.2 μg/μL BSA and 5% glycerol, incubating at room temperature overnight. The samples were then washed three times the with 1 × DEPC-PBST, followed by addition of 50 μL of 0.1 μM each fluorescent detection probes in 2 × SSC, 20% formamide to the chamber, incubating for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were washed three times in 1x DEPC-PBS and dehydrated by submerging in ethanol series of 70%, 85% and absolute, each for two min.
For nuclei staining, 20 μL of SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S36936) medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, D9542) was applied to each sample and incubated at least 10 min before imaging. Finally, image acquisition was performed with a Leica DM6B microscope (Leica, Germany) equipped with a DFC9000GT camera (Leica, Germany) using a 20x objective by the scanning mode of LAS X Life Science software (Leica, Germany). Stitched images were generated with 10% overlap. All images were taken with Z stacks and processed by maximal intensity projection (MIP). The RCA products (RCPs) or speckles were then counted in CellProfiler (version 2.2.0) software ( https://www.cellprofiler.org/ ) using the following pipeline. Breifly, images were exported as single channel tif files and the “IdentifyPrimaryObjects” module was used to identify cell nuclei and RCPs. Identified RCPs were then related to the pseudo “cells” that were created by using the “Distance” algorithm referenced by nuclei using the “IdentifySecondaryObjects” module. Finally, RCPs from different genes in each “cell” were plotted and compared between different areas of the tissue. For fair comparison, around the same numbers of cells from the glycogen-rich tumor and normal tissue region were counted.
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism8 (GraphPad). The data are presented as the mean ± SD or mean ± SEM as indicated in the figure legends and the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used for comparisons between two groups. The exact value of n (number of biological or experimental replicates) can be found in the figure legends and the exact P value s were indicated in the graphed data. A P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For RNA-sequencing data processing in Figure 2 , Benjamini and Hochberg correction were used for significance tests and multiple comparisons. Most experiments were carried out at least three times, and the findings of all key experiments were reliably reproduced.
