Title: Elicitation of broadly protective sarbecovirus immunity by receptor-binding domain nanoparticle vaccines


Abstract: Summary

Understanding vaccine-elicited protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants and other sarbecoviruses is key for guiding public health policies. We show that a clinical stage multivalent SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain nanoparticle (RBD-NP) vaccine protects mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge after a single immunization, indicating a potential dose-sparing strategy. We benchmarked serum neutralizing activity elicited by RBD-NPs in non-human primates against a lead prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (HexaPro) using a panel of circulating mutants. Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are similarly resilient to many RBD residue substitutions tested, although mutations at and surrounding position 484 have negative consequences for neutralization. Mosaic and cocktail nanoparticle immunogens displaying multiple sarbecovirus RBDs elicit broad neutralizing activity in mice and protect mice against SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine. This study provides proof of principle that multivalent sarbecovirus RBD-NPs induce heterotypic protection and motivates advancing such broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines to the clinic.

Section: Introduction

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 resulted in the COVID-19 pandemic that brought the world to a standstill. Moreover, the recurrent spillovers of coronaviruses in humans along with detection of SARS-CoV-2-, SARS-CoV-, and MERS-CoV-related coronaviruses in bats suggest that future zoonotic transmission events may continue to occur ( Menachery et al., 2015 54.

SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through the attachment of the viral transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), followed by fusion of the viral and host membranes ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 31.

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs), and the immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) accounts for more than 90% of the neutralizing activity in COVID-19 convalescent sera and vaccinated individuals ( Greaney et al., 2021a 28.

Worldwide sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates has led to the identification of numerous mutations in the >1,500,000 genome sequences available to date ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ). The SARS-CoV-2 S D614G mutation has become globally dominant and is associated with enhanced viral transmission and replication but does not significantly affect Ab-mediated neutralization ( Hou et al., 2020 32.

We recently described a multivalent subunit vaccine displaying the SARS-CoV-2 RBD nanoparticle (RBD-NP) in a highly immunogenic array using a computationally designed self-assembling protein nanoparticle ( Bale et al., 2016 5.

Vaccination with RBD-NP resulted in 10-fold higher neutralizing Ab titers in mice than the prefusion-stabilized S2P trimer (which is used in most current vaccines) despite a 5-fold lower dose and protected mice against mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-MA) challenge ( Dinnon et al., 2020 23.

We demonstrated that the RBD-NP vaccine elicited robust neutralizing Ab and CD4 T cell responses in NHPs when formulated with several clinic-ready adjuvants and conferred protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nose, pharynges, and bronchioles ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 3.

The isolation of RBD-specific cross-reactive mAbs neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggests that RBD-based vaccines could, in principle, elicit Abs that neutralize distantly related sarbecoviruses, which have future pandemic potential ( Cathcart et al., 2021 12.

Here, we explored dose-sparing strategies for the RBD-NP vaccine and evaluated the impact of genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates and sarbecoviruses on vaccine-elicited Abs. We further designed mosaic and cocktail sarbecovirus RBD-NPs that elicit broad and protective Ab responses against heterologous sarbecovirus challenge, which could represent the next generation of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.

Section: Results

Considering the unprecedented need for rapid global distribution of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we investigated the ability of RBD-NP to induce neutralizing and protective Ab titers at lower doses than previously evaluated. Specifically, we set out to test whether vaccine-elicited neutralizing Ab titers are altered by lowering the immunogen dose 10-fold (two 0.1 μg immunizations, RBD antigen dose) or reducing the number of doses (a single 1 μg immunization, RBD antigen dose) compared to our initial work ( Walls et al., 2020b 86. Walls, A.C. ∙ Fiala, B. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... Elicitation of Potent Neutralizing Antibody Responses by Designed Protein Nanoparticle Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2020; 183 :1367-1382.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test this, BALB/c cByJ mice were immunized intramuscularly at week 0 with either 0.1 μg (ten mice) or 1 μg (two groups of eight mice or sixteen mice total) of AddaVax-adjuvanted RBD-NP. Two weeks post-prime, serum binding and neutralizing Ab titers were roughly comparable for the two vaccine doses (neutralization geometric mean titer [GMT] ∼2–4 × 10 2 ) measured using a mouse leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyping system ( Millet and Whittaker, 2016 57. Millet, J.K. ∙ Whittaker, G.R. Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV)-based Coronavirus Spike-pseudotyped Particle Production and Infection Biol. Protoc. 2016; 6 :e2035 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Walls et al., 2020a 85. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5950) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Data S1 ). Three weeks post prime, we boosted the mice that were immunized with 0.1 μg of the vaccine and eight of the sixteen mice immunized with 1 μg of the vaccine with the same respective dose. Two weeks post-boost, serum binding and neutralizing Ab titers were comparable for the 0.1 μg and 1 μg groups (neutralization GMT ∼2 × 10 4 ) ( Figures 1 C and 1D; Data S1 ), suggesting that a 10-fold reduction in the RBD-NP dose does not affect serum neutralizing responses. Furthermore, we observed that the magnitude of binding and neutralizing Ab titers increased over time for the mice that received a single immunization (neutralization GMT 2 × 10 3 ). These results suggest that lowering the vaccine dose or reducing the number of immunizations represent possible dose-sparing strategies that did not compromise elicitation of high levels of neutralizing Ab titers using RBD-NPs.
To further evaluate vaccine efficacy, eight mice that received one dose and eight mice that received two doses of the 1-μg RBD-NP vaccine along with six unvaccinated mice were challenged ten weeks post-prime with 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10 ( Leist et al., 2020 43. Leist, S.R. ∙ Dinnon, 3rd, K.H. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... A Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV-2 Induces Acute Lung Injury and Mortality in Standard Laboratory Mice Cell. 2020; 183 :1070-1085.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). The SARS-CoV-2 MA10 model causes weight loss and lung pathology when 10 5 PFUs (the highest titer tested [ Leist et al., 2020 43. Leist, S.R. ∙ Dinnon, 3rd, K.H. ∙ Schäfer, A. ...

The mice were followed for four days to assess protection from disease. All mice in the RBD-NP-vaccinated groups were protected from weight loss throughout the duration of the experiment regardless of the number of doses, whereas control mice lost ∼10% of their weight by day four ( Figure 1 E). Analysis of lung pathology and viral titers in lung tissues indicated that the vaccinated mice were not affected by SARS-CoV-2 MA10 challenge, whereas the control mice showed lung discoloration four days post-infection and a high viral load (~1 × 10 4 PFUs) ( Figures 1 F and 1G). These results indicate that one or two immunizations with 1 μg RBD-NPs results in protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA10-induced disease. Furthermore, mice vaccinated twice with a 10-fold lower dose of RBD-antigen (0.1 μg) had higher serum neutralizing Ab titers than mice receiving a single 1-μg dose, suggesting that they would likely also be protected since neutralizing Ab titers are a correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 3.

These data suggest that multiple RBD-NP dose-sparing regimens may be possible.
To characterize the epitopes targeted by RBD-NP-elicited polyclonal Abs, we used deep mutational scanning (DMS) with sera obtained 56 days post-prime from one of two pigtail macaques immunized at days 0 and 28 with a dose of AddaVax-adjuvanted RBD-NP containing 88 μg of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (with a linker of twelve glycine/serine (GS) residues between the RBD and the NP) ( Walls et al., 2020b 86.

These experiments rely on yeast surface display of RBD libraries covering nearly all possible amino acid mutations coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to identify RBD mutants with attenuated Ab binding compared to the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Greaney et al., 2020 27.

No single mutation had more than a marginal effect on serum Ab (IgG/IgM/IgA) binding, indicating broad targeting of distinct RBD epitopes, whereas several previously described COVID-19 human convalescent plasmas (HCPs) analyzed by DMS displayed greater sensitivity to individual mutations and are shown for comparison ( Greaney et al., 2021b 30.

These results show that RBD-NP vaccination elicits highly diverse polyclonal Ab responses that target multiple distinct antigenic sites and are more resilient to escape mutations reducing polyclonal Ab binding than HCP ( Barnes et al., 2020 6.

To measure the magnitude of vaccine-elicited Abs against distinct RBD antigenic sites, we used quantitative competition ELISAs with human ACE2-Fc (hACE2-Fc), which binds to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) corresponding to antigenic sites Ia and Ib, as well as with structurally characterized mAbs recognizing antigenic sites II (CR3022) and IV (S309) ( Huo et al., 2020 34.

These experiments used sera from the aforementioned pigtail macaques (RBD GMT EC 50 5 × 10 4 ) followed for 168 days and sera from 5 rhesus macaques immunized twice on days 0 and 21 with AS03-adjuvanted RBD-NPs containing 25 μg of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (with a 16-GS linker between the RBD and the NP; RBD GMT EC 50 1 × 10 4 ) and followed for 98 days ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 3.

These two sets of RBD-NP sera were compared to sera from 5 rhesus macaques immunized twice on days 0 and 21 with 12.5 μg of AS03-adjuvanted prefusion-stabilized HexaPro S trimer (RBD EC 50 1 × 10 4 ) and followed for 42 days ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 3.

All NHP sera post boost had high titers of Abs targeting sites Ia and Ib in the immunodominant RBM (day 42 hACE2 competition RBD-NP GMT 3 × 10 3 and HexaPro GMT 7 × 10 2 ) ( Figure 2 C; Data S1 ), a correlate of neutralization potency ( Piccoli et al., 2020 60.

We also observed strong Ab responses against antigenic sites II (RBD-NP day 42 GMT 4 × 10 2 and HexaPro GMT 4 × 10 1 ) with CR3022 competition and IV (RBD-NP day 42 GMT 2.5 × 10 3 and HexaPro GMT 6.5 × 10 1 ) ( Figures 2 D and 2E; Data S1 ), which comprise conserved sarbecovirus epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus mAbs such as S2X259 (site II) and S309 (site IV) ( Piccoli et al., 2020 60.

Ab responses were durable against all 3 antigenic sites regardless of dose or adjuvant, with a decrease of competition titers by roughly half an order to one order of magnitude 168 days (pigtail macaque) or 98 days (rhesus macaque) post-prime. RBD-NP elicited much higher peak binding titers toward all RBD antigenic sites evaluated compared to HexaPro S and HCP, showcasing the potency, durability, and multi-specificity of Ab responses induced by multivalent display of the RBD, possibly as a result of enhanced accessibility of the antigen.
To assess the neutralization breadth of RBD-NP- and HexaPro S-elicited Abs in NHPs at peak titer (42 days post-prime), we evaluated serum neutralizing activity against a panel of pseudotyped viruses comprising wild-type (D614G) SARS-CoV-2 S and twelve single-residue SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants detected in clinical isolates (N439K, L452R, Y453F, L455F, S477N, E484A/K/Q, F486L, S494P, N501Y, and G504D) as well as the B.1.1.7 (H69-V70 deletion, Y144 deletion, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H); B.1.1.7 + E484K (H69-V70 deletion, Y144 deletion, E484K, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H); B.1.351 (L18F, D80A, D215G, L242-L244 deletion, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, A701V); and P.1 (L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I). Several single-residue RBD mutations did not affect neutralizing titers compared to wild-type D614G SARS-CoV-2 S, for which GMTs of 1.8 × 10 3 and 2.4 × 10 3 were determined with RBD-NP- and HexaPro S-elicited sera, respectively, using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped virus ( Figure 3 A; Data S1 ). For example, the N439K- (GMT 2.5 × 10 3 for RBD-NP and 2.7 × 10 3 for HexaPro S) and mink-associated Y453F (GMT 4 × 10 3 for RBD-NP and 5 × 10 3 for HexaPro S) mutation did not dampen the neutralization potency of either RBD-NP- or HexaPro S-elicited sera ( Figure 3 A; Data S1 ). However, the N501Y substitution (present in the B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351 lineages) reduced the neutralization potency of RBD-NP- (GMT 5 × 10 2 ) and HexaPro S (GMT 8 × 10 2 )-elicited sera 3-to-4-fold and the L452R mutation (present in the B.1.427/B.1.429, B.1.617.1, and B.1.617.22 variant) led to a 3.4-to-4.4-fold drop in neutralization potency (GMT 4 × 10 2 for RBD-NP and 7 × 10 2 for HexaPro S). These substitutions have been associated with the loss of binding and neutralization for vaccine-elicited Abs and mAbs ( Collier et al., 2021 16.

Wang, Z. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ... mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants Nature. 2021; 592 :616-622 Crossref Scopus (911) PubMed Google Scholar ). The E484A mutation reduced serum neutralization activity up to 2-fold (GMT 1.1x10 3 for RBD-NP and 1.1x10 3 for HexaPro S) whereas E484K, present in B.1.351 and P1 (GMT 2 × 10 2 for RBD-NP and 2 × 10 2 for HexaPro S), and E484Q, found in B.1.617.1 (GMT 5 × 10 2 for RBD-NP and 3.6 × 10 2 for HexaPro S), decreased it 9-fold (E484K) and 4-fold (E484Q) for RBD-NP and 12-fold (484K) and 7-fold (484Q) for HexaPro S compared to D614G SARS-CoV-2 S. These experiments suggest that a substantial fraction of the neutralizing activity elicited by both RBD-NP and HexaPro S is focused on the RBM, especially near position 484, as further supported by the ∼5-fold decrease in neutralization resulting from the F486L (GMT 3.7 × 10 2 for RBD-NP and 5 × 10 2 for HexaPro S) substitution.
To understand the impact of the full constellation of mutations present in the S proteins of the aforementioned VOCs, we evaluated RBD-NP- and HexaPro S-elicited serum neutralizing activity against corresponding HIV and VSV pseudotyped variants (D614G GMT RBD-NP HIV 5 × 10 3 and VSV RBD-NP 6 × 10 2 , respectively, and D614G GMT HexaPro S HIV 3.5 × 10 3 and VSV 1.2 × 10 3 ) ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Although we did not observe major reductions in neutralization titers (up to to 2-fold) toward the B.1.1.7 VOC (GMT RBD-NP HIV 2.5 × 10 3 , VSV 4.7 × 10 2 and HexaPro S HIV 1.8 × 10 3 , VSV 8.8 × 10 2 ) ( Figures 3 B and 3C), addition of the E484K mutation to the B.1.1.7 background reduced neutralization 4-to-6-fold for RBD-NP- (GMT HIV 8.8 × 10 2 ) and HexaPro S-elicited sera (GMT HIV 8.6 × 10 2 ), confirming the importance of the 484 position ( Figure 3 B). Neutralization of B.1.351 was 10-fold lower using HIV pseudovirus (GMT RBD-NP 5 × 10 2 and HexaPro S 3.6x10 2 ) ( Figure 3 B) and ∼3-fold lower using VSV pseudovirus (GMT RBD-NP 2 × 10 2 and HexaPro S 4x10 2 ) ( Figure 3 C) for both RBD-NP- and HexaPro-elicited sera, in agreement with authentic virus neutralization data ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 3.

Interestingly, RBD-specific binding Ab titers did not differ significantly between the B.1.351 RBD (GMT RBD-NP 6.5 × 10 3 and HexaPro S 3 × 10 3 ) and Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD (GMT RBD-NP 1.4 × 10 4 and HexaPro S 1.7 × 10 4 ) ( Figure S2 A), indicating that neutralizing activity is accounted for by a portion of total binding Abs. Reductions in neutralizing Ab titers were also observed against P.1 S VSV pseudoviruses, with a 6-fold drop for RBD-NP (GMT 1 × 10 2 ) and 8-fold dampening for HexaPro S (GMT 1.5 × 10 2 ) ( Figure 3 C). Furthermore, we observed a 10-fold reduction in plasma neutralizing potency for individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against B.1.351 S pseudotyped virus (GMT 6 × 10 1 ) relative to the wild-type (D614G) SARS-CoV-2 S (GMT 6 × 10 2 ) pseudotyped virus ( Figure 3 B; Data S1 ). These findings show that, as is the case for many convalescent individuals ( Greaney et al., 2021b 30. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Loes, A.N. ∙ Crawford, K.H.D. ...

However, we note that neutralization assays may underestimate the contribution of NTD-specific or non-RBM RBD-targeted neutralizing Abs ( Lempp et al., 2021 44.

To further investigate the relationships between neutralizing Ab titers and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, we immunized the two pigtail macaques a third time with RBD-NP, formulated with an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion-based adjuvant, 168 days after the primary immunization ( Figure 2 A). This boost induced potent serum neutralizing activity against wild-type (D614G) SARS-CoV-2 (GMT 2 × 10 4 ) ( Figure 3 D) as well as the B.1.1.7 (GMT 2 × 10 4 ) and B.1.351 (GMT 8 × 10 3 ) VOC pseudoviruses, suggesting that an overall increase in neutralizing Ab titers may be a suitable strategy to cope with emerging variants. These results are consistent with recent studies demonstrating that boosting COVID-19 convalescent individuals with a single mRNA vaccination elicited high (neutralizing) Ab titers, including against the B.1.351 variant ( Abu Jabal et al., 2021 1.

This strategy is currently being evaluated for immunocompromised patients in several countries.
As RBD-NP- and HexaPro S-elicited polyclonal Abs exhibited similar resilience to a range of mutations, we next investigated cross-reactivity with a panel of sarbecovirus RBDs. RBD-NP-elicited polyclonal Abs purified from pigtail macaque serum obtained 70 days post-prime strongly cross-reacted with the SARS-CoV-2-related Pangolin-GD and RaTG13 RBDs and bound more weakly to distantly related RmYN02, SARS-CoV, WIV16, and ZXC21 RBDs ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Measurement of Ab binding titers using the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S2P ectodomain trimers by ELISA showed that RBD-NPs and HexaPro S induced similar levels of cross-reactive Abs against each antigen, with responses roughly two orders of magnitude higher against SARS-CoV-2 S2P (detection antigen matching immunogen) compared to SARS-CoV S2P ( Figure S2 D; Data S1 ). The two immunogens also elicited similar peak levels of SARS-CoV S ACE2-competing Abs (GMT 2 × 10 2 RBD-NP and 5 × 10 1 HexaPro) suggesting that cross-neutralizing Abs might have been induced to similar extents between the two vaccines ( Figure S2 E).
Motivated by the cross-reactivity of RBD-NP-elicited polyclonal Abs with various sarbecovirus RBDs and the correlation between ACE2 competition and serum neutralization titers ( Piccoli et al., 2020 60. Piccoli, L. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

RBD-NP-elicited sera efficiently neutralized pseudotyped viruses harboring the S glycoprotein of the Pangolin-GD isolate (GMT 6.6 × 10 2 and 7.7 × 10 2 VSV) and RaTG13 (GMT VSV 6 × 10 2 ) ( Figures 3 E and 3F) ( Lam et al., 2020 41.

A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14577) PubMed Google Scholar ), in agreement with the close phylogenetic relationship of their RBDs with that of SARS-CoV-2 S ( Figure S2 B). HexaPro S-elicited NHP sera also efficiently neutralized Pangolin-GD S (GMT HIV 4.7 × 10 3 and VSV 9 × 10 2 ) and RaTG13 S pseudotypes (GMT VSV 4.7 × 10 3 ) ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Furthermore, we observed that both RBD-NP- and HexaPro S-induced polyclonal Abs that weakly neutralized HIV pseudovirus carrying SARS-CoV S (RBD-NP GMT 6 × 10 1 and HexaPro GMT 1 × 10 2 ) ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that both immunogens elicited comparable neutralization breadth and potency against the pseudoviruses tested, reinforcing the notion that most sarbecovirus S-directed neutralizing Abs target the RBD ( Greaney et al., 2021a 28.

We and others have recently evaluated nanoparticle immunogens that display multiple antigenic variants of viral glycoproteins as a potential route toward broadly protective vaccines ( Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2021 10.

Given the large number of coronaviruses circulating in zoonotic reservoirs, such vaccines could be important for understanding vaccine-induced neutralization/protection breadth and preventing future pandemics ( Menachery et al., 2015 54. Menachery, V.D. ∙ Yount, Jr., B.L. ∙ Debbink, K. ... A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence Nat.

Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :3048-3053 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). We expressed and purified four RBDs from the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and the bat coronaviruses WIV1 and RaTG13 genetically fused to the I53-50A trimer. An equimolar mixture of these four proteins was added to the I53-50B pentamer to assemble a mosaic RBD-NP (mRBD-NP) co-displaying the four RBDs on the same nanoparticle ( Figure 4 A and S3 A). We also assembled a trivalent mosaic RBD-NP designated “drop out” lacking the SARS-CoV RBD (mRBD-NP-DO), as well as cocktail immunogens with three (cRBD-NP-DO; lacking the SARS-CoV RBD) or four (cRBD-NP) independently assembled nanoparticles, each displaying a single type of the aforementioned RBDs, mixed after independent assembly. Finally, we made a bivalent mosaic RBD-NP co-displaying the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs ( Figure S3 A) to directly confirm co-display on the nanoparticles using a sandwich binding assay. All of the nanoparticle immunogens formed the intended icosahedral architecture and retained native antigenicity, as shown by SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering, negative staining electron microscopy, and binding to hACE2-Fc ( Figures S3 B–S3E). We found that the vaccine candidates were stable for at least 4 weeks at several temperatures except the highest temperature evaluated (37°C), at which we observed a decrease in hACE2 recognition over time beginning after 7 to 14 days, presumably due to aggregation ( Figures 4 B–4E). Following immobilization using the SARS-CoV-2-specific mAb S2H14 ( Piccoli et al., 2020 60. Piccoli, L. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

We determined that the reactivity of the trivalent mRBD-NP derived from the inclusion of the WIV1 RBD in this vaccine, as the monovalent WIV1 RBD-NP also bound the S230 Fab after immobilization with hACE2 (as expected [ Menachery et al., 2016 55. Menachery, V.D. ∙ Yount, Jr., B.L. ∙ Sims, A.C. ... SARS-like WIV1-CoV poised for human emergence Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :3048-3053 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ]), whereas the monovalent SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBD-NPs did not ( Figure S3 H). Collectively, these data demonstrate that all of the nanoparticles were stable and (co-)displayed the various RBDs as intended.
The mosaic and cocktail nanoparticle immunogens were compared to monovalent RBD-NP vaccines and a non-assembling control vaccine comprising all four RBD-I53-50A trimeric components and a non-assembling I53-50B pentamer ( Figure S3 F) in an immunization study in BALB/c cByJ mice ( Figures 4 A and S3 A). All immunizations comprised 1 μg of total RBD antigen, such that ∼0.25 μg of each RBD was given in each administration of the quadrivalent vaccines and ∼0.33 μg of each RBD in the trivalent vaccines. After two immunizations, all four mosaic or cocktail RBD-NP vaccines elicited strong binding (GMT ∼1–5 × 10 4 ) ( Figure S4 A; Data S1 ) and potent serum neutralizing (GMT 2–8 × 10 3 ; Figure 5 A; Data S1 ) Ab titers against wild-type (D614G) SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus. Competition ELISAs using hACE2, CR3022, S309, and S2X259 demonstrated that all mosaic and cocktail vaccine candidates elicited robust Ab titers targeting all antigenic sites tested, showcasing the diversity of RBD-specific Abs elicited ( Figures S4 B–S4E; Data S1 ). The neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S (D614G) Ab responses were slightly higher for mRBD-NPs and slightly lower for cRBD-NPs than that of the monovalent RBD-NP (GMT 3 × 10 3 ) ( Figure 5 A), similar to the aforementioned low-dose RBD-NP immunization study ( Figure 1 D) and suggesting that the dose of strain-matched antigen in the multivalent vaccines is not a limiting factor of the magnitude of neutralizing Ab responses. The neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 elicited by the other monovalent RBD-NPs and the non-assembling control were ∼2 orders of magnitude lower (GMT < 5 × 10 1 ) than for the monovalent RBD-NP, indicating poor elicitation of cross-neutralizing Abs by these heterologous monovalent RBD-NPs.
Although ELISA binding titers were comparable across mosaic and cocktail groups against SARS-CoV S2P (GMT 3–10 × 10 3 ), the corresponding pseudovirus neutralization titers showed more nuanced patterns ( Figures 5 B and S4 F; Data S1 ). Tetravalent mosaic and cocktail RBD-NPs elicited potent neutralizing activity (GMT 3–5.5 × 10 3 ) with magnitudes roughly comparable to that of the monovalent SARS-CoV-RBD-NP (GMT 5 × 10 3 ) ( Figure 5 B). Strikingly, the trivalent nanoparticle immunogens (mRBD-NP-DO and cRBD-NP-DO)—which did not contain the SARS-CoV RBD—also elicited potent neutralization (GMT ∼1–2 × 10 3 ). This cross-neutralization likely arose from the inclusion of the WIV1 RBD ( Figure S4 G; Data S1 ) in the trivalent immunogens, as WIV1 cross-reacts with a SARS-CoV-specific mAb ( Figure S3 H) ( Menachery et al., 2016 55. Menachery, V.D. ∙ Yount, Jr., B.L. ∙ Sims, A.C. ... SARS-like WIV1-CoV poised for human emergence Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :3048-3053 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the monovalent WIV1-RBD-NP induced similar levels of pseudovirus neutralization (GMT 2 × 10 3 ) ( Figure 5 B; Data S1 ). The non-assembling control immunogen, which contains all four RBD-I53-50A trimeric components, also elicited substantial neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV (GMT 1 × 10 3 ) but not against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we show that sera elicited by the monovalent, mRBD-NPs, and cRBD-NPs neutralize SHC014 pseudotyped virus, a distantly related sarbecovirus sharing 76%, 76%, 82%, and 84% amino acid sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, SARS-CoV, and WIV1 RBDs, respectively ( Figure 5 C; Data S1 ). These data show that both mRBD-NPs and cRBD-NPs are promising vaccine candidates for eliciting broad sarbecovirus immunity, in agreement with previous findings using a different nanoparticle platform ( Cohen et al., 2021a 14. Cohen, A.A. ∙ Gnanapragasam, P.N.P. ∙ Lee, Y.E. ... Mosaic nanoparticles elicit cross-reactive immune responses to zoonotic coronaviruses in mice Science. 2021; 371 :735-741 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ) or chimeric sarbecovirus S glycoproteins ( Martinez et al., 2021b 49. Martinez, D.R. ∙ Schäfer, A. ∙ Leist, S.R. ... Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines protect against Sarbecovirus challenge in mice Science. 2021; 373 :991-998 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) and recent results obtained with influenza virus hemagglutinin nanoparticle vaccines ( Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2021 10. Boyoglu-Barnum, S. ∙ Ellis, D. ∙ Gillespie, R.A. ... Quadrivalent influenza nanoparticle vaccines induce broad protection Nature. 2021; 592 :623-628 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To gauge the ability of the multivalent RBD-NPs to confer protection against vaccine-matched and heterotypic sarbecoviruses, we challenged groups of eight mice with a high dose (10 5 PFUs) of the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV MA15 virus ( Roberts et al., 2007 66. Roberts, A. ∙ Deming, D. ∙ Paddock, C.D. ... A mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus causes disease and mortality in BALB/c mice PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3 :e5 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with the pseudovirus neutralization data, animals immunized with mRBD-NP, mRBD-NP-DO, cRBD-NP, and cRBD-NP-DO were protected from weight loss (ranging between 1% and 5%) and serious lung pathology throughout the four days of the experiment ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Unvaccinated mice exhibited up to 15% average weight loss and signs of lung pathology (congestion score ∼1.5) that were only minorly seen in all other vaccinated groups ( Figures 6 A and 6B). mRBD-NP- and mRBD-NP-DO-vaccinated mice were completely protected from viral replication in the lungs ( Figure 6 C). Overall, the trivalent mRBD-NP-DO provided protection that was indistinguishable from the tetravalent mRBD-NP, despite lacking the SARS-CoV RBD. Five out of eight and six out of eight cRBD-NP- and cRBD-NP-DO-vaccinated mice were completely protected from viral replication in the lungs, respectively, with viral burden ranging between 10 2 and 10 3 PFUs/lobe for the remaining animals (compared to unvaccinated mice with ∼10 6 PFUs/lobe, Figure 6 C). To assess whether the RBD-NP platform causes vaccine-induced immune pathology, which was previously described with double-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines ( Bolles et al., 2011 9. Bolles, M. ∙ Deming, D. ∙ Long, K. ... A double-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine provides incomplete protection in mice and induces increased eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary response upon challenge J. Virol. 2011; 85 :12201-12215 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ), we investigated eosinophil infiltration and inflammation in the lungs following SARS-CoV MA15 challenge. Although infection induced inflammation and infiltration of eosinophils in the lungs of unvaccinated mice ( Figures 6 D, 6I, and S5 A), no signs of eosinophilia were detected for any animals in the vaccinated groups using histological analysis of stained lung sections ( Figures 6 D–6I and S5 A). These data show that mRBD-NP, mRBD-NP-DO, cRBD-NP, and cRBD-NP-DO protect against weight loss, lung injury, and viral replication following challenge, with no detectable vaccine-induced immune pathology.
To identify the gain in protective breadth provided by multivalent display of sarbecovirus RBD-NP, relative to monovalent RBD-NPs, we performed a second SARS-CoV MA15 challenge experiment including monovalent RBD-NP and SARS-CoV-RBD-NP ( Figure S5 B). In agreement with the pseudovirus neutralization data and first challenge ( Figures 4 B–4D and 6 A–6C), animals immunized with the SARS-CoV-RBD-NP, mosaic, and cocktail RBD-NP formulations, as well as the non-assembling control immunogen, were protected from weight loss and serious lung pathology throughout the four days of the experiment. The animals receiving the monovalent RBD-NP vaccine experienced up to 12% average weight loss, whereas the unvaccinated mice exhibited further (up to 15%) average weight loss and signs of lung pathology (congestion score ∼2) that were only minorly seen in all other vaccinated groups ( Figures S5 B and S5C). All mice vaccinated with SARS-CoV-RBD-NP, RBD-NP, and mRBD-NP were protected from viral replication in the lungs, whereas we detected ∼10 2.5 and 10 6 PFUs/lobe for half of the mice receiving the non-assembling control immunogen and unvaccinated mice, respectively ( Figure S5 D). These results provide proof-of-principle that mosaic and cocktail RBD nanoparticle vaccines elicit broad protection against heterotypic sarbecovirus challenge and could represent the next generation of vaccines developed in anticipation of future spillovers.

Section: Discussion

The data presented here show that two ultra-low dose immunizations or a single immunization with RBD-NP produces potent neutralizing Ab responses in mice. The latter strategy confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA10 challenge, suggesting that the nanoparticle platform could enable dose-sparing regimens to achieve global vaccination, especially given the high shelf stability of this vaccine ( Walls et al., 2020b 86. Walls, A.C. ∙ Fiala, B. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... Elicitation of Potent Neutralizing Antibody Responses by Designed Protein Nanoparticle Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2020; 183 :1367-1382.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ). NHP vaccination with RBD-NP was concurrently shown to also elicit CD4 T cell responses and to protect from viral replication ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 3. Arunachalam, P.S. ∙ Walls, A.C. ∙ Golden, N. ... Adjuvanting a subunit COVID-19 vaccine to induce protective immunity Nature. 2021; 594 :253-258 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, RBD-NP vaccination, which is currently under phase I/II evaluation in the clinic, elicits diverse Ab responses neutralizing a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in clinical isolates with similar potency to those elicited by HexaPro S vaccination. Several RBM mutations, including at position E484, however, lead to reductions in neutralizing activity elicited by either RBD-NP or HexaPro S in NHPs. Although both RBD-NP- and HexaPro S-elicited sera robustly neutralize the B.1.1.7 S variant, which does not contain the E484 substitution, neutralization of the B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.1.7/E484K variants was dampened similarly to sera from individuals vaccinated twice with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA. These findings are in agreement with reports showing that the serum neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 variant from mRNA-1273-vaccinated individuals was comparably reduced ( Wu et al., 2021 95. Wu, K. ∙ Werner, A.P. ∙ Koch, M. ... Serum Neutralizing Activity Elicited by mRNA-1273 Vaccine - Preliminary Report N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384 :1468-1470 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ), as was also the case for neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 by HCP ( Wibmer et al., 2021 93. Wibmer, C.K. ∙ Ayres, F. ∙ Hermanus, T. ... SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 escapes neutralization by South African COVID-19 donor plasma Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :622-625 Crossref Scopus (709) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, these data indicate that a significant fraction of vaccine-elicited neutralizing activity is directed to the RBM, which is the target of potent neutralizing Abs, irrespective of the antigen design strategy (RBD- or S-based), the vaccine modality (protein subunit or mRNA), or species (NHPs or humans). We show that receiving a third immunization, even of an unaltered vaccine, improves the neutralizing Ab responses to VOCs, which is reminiscent of what has been shown in vaccinated humans previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 ( Abu Jabal et al., 2021 1.

USA. 2016; 113 :3048-3053 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ) and other animal reservoirs strongly motivate the development of vaccines that protect against a broad spectrum of coronaviruses. We observed that vaccination of NHPs with RBD-NPs or HexaPro S induced comparable but moderate neutralization breadth against genetically distinct sarbecoviruses. We demonstrate here that co-display (mRBD-NP) and co-immunization (cRBD-NP) of multivalently arrayed sarbecovirus RBDs elicit robust neutralizing Ab responses against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and SHC014 pseudotyped viruses and outperform their monovalent vaccine counterparts. The observation that mosaic and cocktail RBD-NPs elicit greater titers of Abs competing with the broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus mAb S2X259 than monovalent vaccines suggest that this vaccine design strategy could enhance neutralization breadth. Accordingly, mice vaccinated with multivalent vaccines were protected from disease upon SARS-CoV MA15 challenge, including with formulations that did not include the SARS-CoV RBD, whereas RBD-NP-vaccinated mice experienced weight loss. Previous studies showed that double-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines could lead to eosinophil infiltration in the lungs and subsequent immune pathology ( Bolles et al., 2011 9. Bolles, M. ∙ Deming, D. ∙ Long, K. ... A double-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine provides incomplete protection in mice and induces increased eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary response upon challenge J. Virol. 2011; 85 :12201-12215 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data show that none of the multivalent vaccine candidates evaluated here induced eosinophilia whereas SARS-CoV MA15 challenge did, pointing to the safety and efficacy of these immunogens. Our data highlight the potential of this approach to achieve broad sarbecovirus immunity, overcoming both the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and putative future zoonosis of genetically distinct sarbecoviruses not included in the vaccine. Based on the RBD-centric nature of neutralizing Ab responses resulting from infection and vaccination ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021 21. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ...

Due to the cost of challenge and BSL-3 vivarium limitations, the mice vaccinated with a low dose of RBD-NP were not challenged, and therefore we can only infer the likelihood of protection from their sera’s ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus better than other mice (i.e., those given a single vaccine dose) that were challenged. Neutralization is a correlate of protection in NHPs ( Arunachalam et al., 2021 3. Arunachalam, P.S. ∙ Walls, A.C. ∙ Golden, N. ... Adjuvanting a subunit COVID-19 vaccine to induce protective immunity Nature. 2021; 594 :253-258 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ), but we recognize that neutralization assays using HEK-ACE2 cell lines may underestimate the effects of non-RBM targeting Abs ( Lempp et al., 2021 44.

Due to the limitations of the number of animals and the cost of challenge, we cannot challenge with all desired point mutant or variant strains and must use neutralization as the best correlate for interpreting the expected challenge outcome.

The cells were harvested and lysed by microfluidization using a Microfluidics M110P at 18,000 psi in 50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 0.75% CHAPS. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 24,000 g for 30 min and applied to a 2.6 × 10 cm Ni Sepharose 6 FF column (Cytiva) for purification by IMAC on an AKTA Avant150 FPLC system (Cytiva). Protein of interest was eluted over a linear gradient of 30 mM to 500 mM imidazole in a background of 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% CHAPS buffer. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated in 10K MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore), sterile filtered (0.22 μm) and applied to either a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300, or HiLoad S200 pg GL SEC column (Cytiva) using 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% CHAPS buffer. I53-50A elutes at ∼0.6 column volume (CV). I53-50B.4PT1 elutes at ∼0.45 CV. After sizing, bacterial-derived components were tested to confirm low levels of endotoxin before using for nanoparticle assembly.
Proteins containing His tags were purified from clarified supernatants via a batch bind method where each clarified supernatant was supplemented with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 45 mM and 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of ∼310 mM. Talon cobalt affinity resin (Takara) was added to the treated supernatants and allowed to incubate for 15 min with gentle shaking. Resin was collected using vacuum filtration with a 0.2 μm filter and transferred to a gravity column. The resin was washed with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted with 3 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole. The batch bind process was then repeated and the first and second elutions combined. SDS-PAGE was used to assess purity. RBD-I53-50A fusion protein IMAC elutions were concentrated to > 1 mg/mL and subjected to three rounds of dialysis into 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 185 mM NaCl, 100 mM Arginine, 4.5% glycerol, and 0.75% w/v 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) in a hydrated 10K molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Thermo Scientific). S2P and HexaPro IMAC elution fractions were concentrated to ∼1 mg/mL and dialyzed three times into 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% L-Histidine in a hydrated 10K molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Thermo Scientific).
Clarified supernatants of cells expressing monoclonal antibodies and human ACE2-Fc were purified using a MabSelect PrismA 2.6 × 5 cm column (Cytiva) on an AKTA Avant150 FPLC (Cytiva). Bound antibodies were washed with five column volumes of 20 mM NaPO 4 , 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2, then five column volumes of 20 mM NaPO 4 , 1 M NaCl pH 7.4 and eluted with three column volumes of 100 mM glycine at pH 3.0. The eluate was neutralized with 2 M Trizma base to 50 mM final concentration. SDS-PAGE was used to assess purity.
Recombinant S309 was expressed as a Fab in expiCHO cells transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing the heavy and light chain, as described above (see Transient transfection) ( Pinto et al., 2020 61. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protein was affinity-purified using a HiTrap Protein A Mab select Xtra column (Cytiva) followed by desalting against 20 mM NaPO 4 , 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2 using a HiTrap Fast desalting column (Cytiva). The protein was sterilized with a 0.22 μm filter and stored at 4°C until use.
Total protein concentration of purified individual nanoparticle components was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using a UV/vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 8454) and calculated extinction coefficients. The assembly steps were performed at room temperature with addition in the following order: RBD-I53-50A trimeric fusion protein, followed by additional buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 185 mM NaCl, 100 mM Arginine, 4.5% glycerol, and 0.75% w/v CHAPS) as needed to achieve desired final concentration, and finally I53-50B.4PT1 pentameric component (in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% w/v CHAPS), with a molar ratio of RBD-I53-50A:I53-50B.4PT1 of 1.1:1. All RBD-I53-50 in vitro assemblies were incubated at 2-8°C with gentle rocking for at least 30 min before subsequent purification by SEC in order to remove residual unassembled component. Different columns were utilized depending on purpose: Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column was used analytically for nanoparticle size estimation, a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column used for small-scale pilot assemblies, and a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pg column used for nanoparticle production. Assembled particles were purified in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 185 mM NaCl, 100 mM Arginine, 4.5% glycerol, and 0.75% w/v CHAPS, and elute at ∼11 mL on the Superose 6 column and in the void volume of Superdex 200 columns. Assembled nanoparticles were sterile filtered (0.22 μm) immediately prior to column application and following pooling of fractions.
Endotoxin levels in protein samples were measured using the EndoSafe Nexgen-MCS System (Charles River). Samples were diluted 1:50 or 1:100 in Endotoxin-free LAL reagent water, and applied into wells of an EndoSafe LAL reagent cartridge. Charles River EndoScan-V software was used to analyze endotoxin content, automatically back-calculating for the dilution factor. Endotoxin values were reported as EU/mL which were then converted to EU/mg based on UV/vis measurements. Our threshold for samples suitable for immunization was < 50 EU/mg.
Two Pigtail macaques were immunized with 250 μg of RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticle (88 μg RBD antigen) with AddaVax at day 0, day 28, and O/W at day 168. Blood was collected every 14 days post-prime. Blood was collected in serum collection tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature. Serum was isolated after a 15 min spin at 1455 x g for 15 min and stored at −80C until use. Prior to vaccination or blood collection, animals were sedated with an intramuscular injection (10 mg/kg) of ketamine (Ketaset®; Henry Schein). Prior to inoculation, immunogen suspensions were gently mixed 1:1 vol/vol with AddaVax adjuvant for immunizations 1 and 2 and O/W for immunization 3 (VFI) to reach a final concentration of 0.250 mg/mL antigen. The vaccine was delivered intramuscularly into both quadriceps muscles with 1 mL per injection site on days 0, 28, and 168. All injection sites were shaved prior to injection. Animals were observed daily for general health (activity and appetite, urine/feces output) and for evidence of reactogenicity at the vaccine inoculation site (swelling, erythema, and pruritus) for up to 1 week following vaccination. They also received physical exams including temperature and weight measurements at each study time point. None of the animals became severely ill during the course of the study nor required euthanasia.

Briefly, duplicate mutant libraries were constructed in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2 (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank: MN908947, residues N331-T531) and contain 3,804 of the 3,819 possible amino-acid mutations, with > 95% present as single mutants. Each RBD variant was linked to a unique 16-nucleotide barcode sequence to facilitate downstream sequencing. As previously described, libraries were sorted for RBD expression and ACE2 binding to eliminate RBD variants that are completely misfolded or non-functional (i.e., lacking modest ACE2 binding affinity) ( Greaney et al., 2020 27.

The antibody escape mapping for the vaccinated NHP serum was performed in this study; the antibody escape mapping from convalescent human plasma was performed in Greaney et al. (2021b) 30.

Briefly, mutant yeast libraries induced to express RBD were washed and incubated with plasma or serum at a range of dilutions for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. For each sample, we chose a sub-saturating dilution such that the amount of fluorescent signal due to plasma antibody binding to RBD was approximately equal across samples. A 1:1000 dilution was used for the vaccinated NHP serum, and the exact dilutions of human convalescent plasma are reported in Greaney et al. (2021b) 30. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Loes, A.N. ∙ Crawford, K.H.D. ...

After the antibody incubations, the libraries were secondarily labeled with 1:100 FITC-conjugated anti-MYC antibody (Immunology Consultants Lab, CYMC-45F) to label for RBD expression and and 1:200 Alexa-647-conjugated goat anti-human-IgA+IgG+IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch 109-605-064) to label for bound serum or plasma antibodies. A flow cytometric selection gate was drawn to capture approximately 5% of the RBD mutant libraries with the lowest amount of plasma binding for their degree of RBD expression. For each sample, approximately 10 million RBD+ cells were processed on the cytometer. Antibody-escaped cells were grown overnight in SD-CAA (6.7g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base, 5.0g/L Casamino acids, 1.065 g/L MES acid, and 2% w/v dextrose) to expand cells prior to plasmid extraction.
Plasmid samples were prepared from pre-selection and overnight cultures of antibody-escaped cells (Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid Miniprep II) as previously described ( Greaney et al., 2020 27. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Starr, T.N. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ...

We used the dms_variants package ( https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_variants/ , version 0.8.2) to process Illumina sequences into counts of each barcoded RBD variant in each pre-sort and antibody-escape population using the barcode/RBD look-up table from Starr et al.

SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies that maximize breadth and resistance to escape Nature. 2021; 597 :97-102 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar .
For each serum selection, we computed the “escape fraction” for each barcoded variant using the deep sequencing counts for each variant in the original and serum-escape populations and the total fraction of the library that escaped antibody binding via the formula provided in Greaney et al. (2020) 27. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Starr, T.N. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ... Complete Mapping of Mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain that Escape Antibody Recognition Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 29 :44-57.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (644) PubMed Google Scholar . These escape fractions represent the estimated fraction of cells expressing that specific variant that fall in the antibody escape bin, such that a value of 0 means the variant is always bound by serum and a value of 1 means that it always escapes serum binding. We then applied a computational filter to remove variants with low sequencing counts or highly deleterious mutations that might cause antibody escape simply by leading to poor expression of properly folded RBD on the yeast cell surface ( Greaney et al., 2020 27. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Starr, T.N. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ...

Specifically, we removed variants that had (or contained mutations with) ACE2 binding scores < −2.35 or expression scores < −1, using the variant- and mutation-level deep mutational scanning scores from Starr et al.

We next deconvolved variant-level escape scores into escape fraction estimates for single mutations using global epistasis models ( Otwinowski et al., 2018 58. Otwinowski, J. ∙ McCandlish, D.M. ∙ Plotkin, J.B. Inferring the shape of global epistasis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Complete Mapping of Mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain that Escape Antibody Recognition Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 29 :44-57.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (644) PubMed Google Scholar . The reported escape fractions throughout the paper are the average across the libraries (correlations shown in Figure S2 ); these scores are also in Table S1 and at https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_RBD-nano-vax-NHP1/blob/main/results/supp_data/NHP_HCS_raw_data.csv . Sites of strong escape from each antibody were determined heuristically as sites whose summed mutational escape scores were at least 10 times the median sitewise sum of selection, and within 10-fold of the sitewise sum of the most strongly selected site. Sites shown in Figures 2 and S2 A are the sites of strong escape for any of the three human convalescent plasma, plus sites 417, 452, and 501 due to their prevalence in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. For each plasma, the y axis is scaled to be the greatest of (a) the maximum site-wise escape metric observed for that plasma, (b) 20x the median site-wise escape fraction observed across all sites for that plasma, or (c) an absolute value of 1.0 (to appropriately scale plasma that are not “noisy” but for which no mutation has a strong effect on plasma binding).

Briefly, 293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep seeded in 10-cm dishes were transfected with the plasmid encoding for the corresponding S glycoprotein using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) following manufacturer’s indications. One day post-transfection, cells were infected with VSV(G ∗ ΔG-luciferase) and after 2 h were washed five times with DMEM before adding medium supplemented with anti-VSV-G antibody (I1- mouse hybridoma supernatant, CRL- 2700, ATCC). Virus pseudotypes were harvested 18-24 h post-inoculation, clarified by centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 5 min, filtered through a 0.45 μm cut off membrane, concentrated 10 times with a 30 kDa cut off membrane, aliquoted and stored at −80°C.
HEK293-hACE2 cells ( Crawford et al., 2020 19. Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Eguia, R. ∙ Dingens, A.S. ... Protocol and Reagents for Pseudotyping Lentiviral Particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein for Neutralization Assays Viruses. 2020; 12 :513 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ) were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 1% PenStrep with 8% CO 2 in a 37°C incubator (ThermoFisher). One day prior to infection, 40 μL of poly-lysine (Sigma) was placed into 96-well plates and incubated with rotation for 5 min. Poly-lysine was removed, plates were dried for 5 min then washed 1 × with water prior to plating with 40,000 cells. The following day, cells were checked to be at 80% confluence. In an empty half-area 96-well plate a 1:3 serial dilution of sera was made in DMEM and diluted pseudovirus was then added to the serial dilution and incubated at room temperature for 30-60 min. After incubation, the sera-virus mixture was added to the cells at 37°C and 2 hours post-infection, 40 μL 20% FBS-2% PenStrep DMEM was added. After 17-20 hours (VSV) or 48 hours (HIV, MLV) 40 μL/well of One-Glo-EX substrate (Promega) was added to the cells and incubated in the dark for 5-10 min prior reading on a BioTek plate reader. Measurements were done in at least duplicate. Relative luciferase units were plotted and normalized in Prism (GraphPad). Nonlinear regression of log(inhibitor) versus normalized response was used to determine IC 50 values from curve fits. Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare two groups to determine whether they were statistically different.
Purification of Fabs from NHP serum was adapted from Boyoglu-Barnum et al. (2021) 10. Boyoglu-Barnum, S. ∙ Ellis, D. ∙ Gillespie, R.A. ... Quadrivalent influenza nanoparticle vaccines induce broad protection Nature. 2021; 592 :623-628 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, 1 mL of day 70 serum was diluted to 10 mL with PBS and incubated with 1 mL of 3 × PBS-washed protein A beads (GenScript) with agitation overnight at 37°C. The next day beads were thoroughly washed with PBS using a gravity flow column and bound Abs were eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 3.5 into 1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 100 mM. Serum and early washes that flowed through were re-bound to beads overnight again for a second, repeat elution. IgGs were concentrated (Amicon 30 kDa) and buffer exchanged into PBS. 2 × digestion buffer (40 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5, 20 mM EDTA, 40 mM cysteine) was added to concentrated and pooled IgGs. 500 μL of resuspended immobilized papain resin (ThermoFisher Scientific) freshly washed in 1 × digestion buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM cysteine, pH 6.5) was added to purified IgGs in 2 × digestion buffer and samples were agitated for 5 h at 37°C. The supernatant was separated from resin and resin washes were collected and pooled with the resin flow through. Pooled supernatants were sterile-filtered at 0.22 μm and applied 6 × to PBS-washed protein A beads in a gravity flow column. The column was eluted as described above and the papain procedure repeated overnight with undigested IgGs to increase yield. The protein A flow throughs were pooled, concentrated (using an Amicon 10 kDa), and buffer exchanged into PBS. Purity was checked by SDS-PAGE.
Assays were performed and analyzed using biolayer interferometry on an Octet Red 96 System (Pall Forte Bio/Sartorius) at ambient temperature with shaking at 1000 rpm. Different Sarbeco RBDs were purified like in Walls et al., 2020 and were diluted with different acetate buffers and applied to a black 96-well Greiner Bio-one microplate at 200ul per well. GD-Pangolin RBD was diluted in pH 6 buffer to 5 μg/mL, RmNY02 were diluted in pH 5 to 25 μg/mL, WIV16 was diluted in pH 5 to 10 μg/mL, SARS-CoV-2 was diluted in pH 6 to 5 μg/mL, RaTG13 was diluted in pH 6 to 10 μg/mL, RaTG13 was diluted in pH 6 to 10 μg/mL, SARS-CoV was diluted in pH 6 to 50 μg/mL, and finally ZXC21 was diluted in pH 6 to 10μg/mL. AR2G biosensors (ForteBio/Sartorius) following 600 s hydration were normalized in water for 180 s. Then tips were NHS-EDC activated for 300 s and the different sarbecovirus RBDs were loaded up to a 1.50 nm threshold for up to 600 s. Immobilized RBDs on the tips were quenched for 300 s in ethanolamine and dipped into kinetics buffer for a 60 s baseline. The association step was performed by dipping the mobilized RBDs into diluted purified polyclonal pigtail macaque IgGs for 600 s. Dissociation was measured by inserting the biosensors in kinetics buffer for 600 s. The data were baseline subtracted and the plots fitted using the Pall ForteBio/Sartorius analysis software (version 12.0).
Binding of hACE2-Fc to monovalent RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles, mosaic-RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles, and cocktail of RBD-nanoparticles was analyzed for antigenicity experiments and real-time stability studies using an Octet Red 96 System (Pall FortéBio/Sartorius) at ambient temperature with shaking at 1000 rpm. Protein samples were diluted to 100 nM in Kinetics buffer (1 × HEPES-EP+ (Pall Forté Bio), 0.05% nonfat milk, and 0.02% sodium azide). Buffer, receptor, and analyte were then applied to a black 96-well Greiner Bio-one microplate at 200 μL per well. Protein A biosensors (FortéBio/Sartorius) were first hydrated for 10 minutes in Kinetics buffer, then dipped into hACE2-Fc diluted to 10 μg/mL in Kinetics buffer in the immobilization step. After 150 s, the tips were transferred to kinetics buffer for 60 s to reach a baseline. The association step was performed by dipping the loaded biosensors into the immunogens for 300 s, and subsequent dissociation was performed by dipping the biosensors back into Kinetics buffer for an additional 300 s. The data were baseline subtracted prior for plotting using the FortéBio analysis software (version 12.0). Plots in Figure S3 show the 600 s of association and dissociation.
Binding of hACE2-Fc or S2H14 mAb and S230 Fab to WIV1-RBD-I53-50, RaTG13-RBD-I53-50, SARS-CoV-SARS-CoV2-RBD-I53-50, SARS-CoV2-I53-50, and mosaic-RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles were analyzed for co-display of RBDs using an Octet Red 96 System (Pall FortéBio/Sartorius) at ambient temperature with shaking at 1000 rpm. Nanoparticles were diluted to 100 nM in Kinetics buffer. Kinetics buffer, mAb, nanoparticles and Fab were then applied to a black 96-well Greiner Bio-one microplate at 200 μL per well. Protein A biosensors (FortéBio/Sartorius) were first hydrated for 10 minutes in Kinetics buffer, then dipped into hACE2-Fc or S2H14 mAb diluted to 10 μg/mL in Kinetics buffer in the immobilization step. After 150 s, the tips were transferred to Kinetics buffer for 60 s to reach a baseline. The receptor or mAb was then loaded with nanoparticle by dipping the loaded biosensors into the immunogens for 300 s, and subsequent baseline was performed by dipping the biosensors back into the Kinetics buffer for an additional 60 s. Association of S230 Fab diluted to 100 nM in Kinetics buffer was then measured for 300 s and subsequent dissociation in Kinetics buffer of S230 Fab for 300 s. The data were baseline subtracted prior for plotting using the FortéBio analysis software (version 12.0). Plots in Figure S3 exclude the initial mAb loading and the first baseline.
Monovalent RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles, mosaic-RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles, and cocktail of RBD-nanoparticles were first diluted to 75 μg/mL in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 185 mM NaCl, 100 mM Arginine, 4.5% v/v Glycerol, 0.75% w/v CHAPS prior to application of 3 μL of sample onto freshly glow-discharged 300-mesh copper grids. Sample was incubated on the grid for 1 minute before the grid was dipped in a 50 μL droplet of water and excess liquid blotted away with filter paper (Whatman). The grids were then dipped into 6 μL of 0.75% w/v uranyl formate stain. Stain was blotted off with filter paper, then the grids were dipped into another 6 μL of stain and incubated for ∼70 s. Finally, the stain was blotted away and the grids were allowed to dry for 1 minute. Prepared grids were imaged in a Talos model L120C electron microscope at 57,000 × (nanoparticles).
Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was used to measure hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) and % Polydispersity (%Pd) of monovalent RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles, mosaic-RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles, and cocktail of RBD-nanoparticles on an UNcle Nano-DSF (UNchained Laboratories). Sample was applied to a 8.8 μL quartz capillary cassette (UNi, UNchained Laboratories) and measured with 10 acquisitions of 5 s each, using auto-attenuation of the laser. Increased viscosity due to 4.5% v/v glycerol in the RBD nanoparticle buffer was accounted for by the UNcle Client software in Dh measurements.
At six weeks of age, 8 female BALB/c mice per dosing group were vaccinated with a prime immunization, and three weeks later mice were boosted with a second vaccination (IACUC protocol 4470.01). Prior to inoculation, immunogen suspensions were gently mixed 1:1 vol/vol with AddaVax adjuvant (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) to reach a final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL antigen. Mice were injected intramuscularly into the gastrocnemius muscle of each hind leg using a 27-gauge needle (BD, San Diego, CA) with 50 μL per injection site (100 μL total) of immunogen under isoflurane anesthesia. To obtain sera all mice were bled two weeks after prime and boost immunizations. Blood was collected via submental venous puncture and rested in 1.5 mL plastic Eppendorf tubes at room temperature for 30 min to allow for coagulation. Serum was separated from red blood cells via centrifugation at 2,000 g for 10 min. Complement factors and pathogens in isolated serum were heat-inactivated via incubation at 56°C for 60 min. Serum was stored at 4°C or −80°C until use. The study was repeated twice. Five weeks post-boost, mice (aged 14 weeks) were exported from Comparative Medicine Facility at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA to an AAALAC accredited Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL3) Laboratory at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. After a 7-day acclimation time, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine and challenged intranasally with 10 5 plaque-forming units (pfu) of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10 or SARS-CoV MA15 strain for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy (IACUC protocol 20-114.0). After infection, body weight and congestion score were monitored daily until the termination of the study two days post-infection, when lung and nasal turbinate tissues were harvested to evaluate viral load by plaque assay.
For each mouse the left lung was incubated in formalin at 4°C for at least 7 days to fix tissue and inactivate virus. The fixed tissue was processed and embedded in paraffin. 5 μm sections were cut and stained with either Congo red or hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Eosinophils were enumerated by counting the Congo red positive leukocytes in 10 high power fields (400X final magnification) per mouse lung. Representative images were minimally and similarly adjusted with Adobe Photoshop 2020 to enhance contrast. Airway pathology was assessed in H&E stained sections to assess bronchial epithelial cell death (score: 0 = no dead cells, 1 = 1-5 dead cells, 2 = 6-10 dead cells, 3 = 11-20 dead cells and 4 = > 20 dead cells; scored for 10 400X fields per mouse lung), peribronchial inflammation (score 0 = none, 1 = 0%–25% circumference with > 1 leukocyte cell layer, 2 = 26%–50% circumference with > 1 leukocyte cell layer, and 3 = 50%–100% circumference with > 1 leukocyte cell layer; scored for 10 400X fields per mouse lung), and interstitial pneumonitis (score = percentage of pulmonary alveolar parenchyma with septae expanded by leukocyte; scored for 10 100X fields).
Statistical details of experiments can be found in the figure legends. For NHP experiments, 2-6 sera samples were used and experiments were done in at least duplicate unless mentioned. For mouse ELISAs, neutralization, and challenge experiments, sera from 6, 8, or 10 BALB/c animals were used and experiments were completed in at least duplicate unless mentioned. Geometric mean titers were calculated. Kruskal Wallis tests were performed to compare two groups to determine whether they were statistically different for ELISA and neutralization experiments. Significance is indicated with stars: ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001 and non significant groups are not shown.
