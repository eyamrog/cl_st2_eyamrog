Title: The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses


Abstract: Summary

The human monoclonal antibody C10 exhibits extraordinary cross-reactivity, potently neutralizing Zika virus (ZIKV) and the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1–DENV4). Here we describe a comparative structure-function analysis of C10 bound to the envelope (E) protein dimers of the five viruses it neutralizes. We demonstrate that the C10 Fab has high affinity for ZIKV and DENV1 but not for DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4. We further show that the C10 interaction with the latter viruses requires an E protein conformational landscape that limits binding to only one of the three independent epitopes per virion. This limited affinity is nevertheless counterbalanced by the particle’s icosahedral organization, which allows two different dimers to be reached by both Fab arms of a C10 immunoglobulin. The epitopes’ geometric distribution thus confers C10 its exceptional neutralization breadth. Our results highlight the importance not only of paratope/epitope complementarity but also the topological distribution for epitope-focused vaccine design.

Section: Introduction

Flaviviruses are the most important arthropod-borne viral pathogens for humans, causing severe disease around the world ( Collins and Metz, 2017 7. Collins, M.H. ∙ Metz, S.W. Progress and Works in Progress: Update on Flavivirus Vaccine Development Clin. Ther. 2017; 39 :1519-1536 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among them is the highly teratogenic and neurotropic Zika virus (ZIKV), which re-emerged recently ( Pierson and Diamond, 2018 38. Pierson, T.C. ∙ Diamond, M.S. The emergence of Zika virus and its new clinical syndromes Nature. 2018; 560 :573-581 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the worldwide distributed dengue viruses of serotype 1-4 (DENV1–DENV4), which impose a very high toll on public health, with 50–100 million cases yearly. The four DENVs cause ∼500,000 hospitalizations annually ( Bhatt et al., 2013 4. Bhatt, S. ∙ Gething, P.W. ∙ Brady, O.J. ... The global distribution and burden of dengue Nature. 2013; 496 :504-507 Crossref Scopus (6734) PubMed Google Scholar ) of individuals with a hemorrhagic syndrome resulting from vascular leakage ( Halstead, 2007 18. Halstead, S.B. Dengue Lancet. 2007; 370 :1644-1652 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1239) PubMed Google Scholar ). The neutralizing antibodies induced during a DENV or ZIKV infection target the envelope (E) protein ( Fibriansah and Lok, 2016 12. Fibriansah, G. ∙ Lok, S.M. The development of therapeutic antibodies against dengue virus Antiviral Res. 2016; 128 :7-19 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, with a few exceptions, are serotype specific. Cross-reactive antibodies are also elicited, which, in general, are poorly neutralizing and have been linked to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the disease upon ulterior heterotypic infection ( Halstead, 2014 19. Halstead, S.B. Dengue Antibody-Dependent Enhancement: Knowns and Unknowns Microbiol. Spectr. 2014; 2 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). As a result, no efficient anti-dengue vaccine is currently available ( Halstead et al., 2020 20. Halstead, S.B. ∙ Katzelnick, L.C. ∙ Russell, P.K. ... Ethics of a partially effective dengue vaccine: Lessons from the Philippines Vaccine. 2020; 38 :5572-5576 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a potential effect of ZIKV vaccination of potentiating a subsequent dengue infection is a concern ( Priyamvada et al., 2017 40. Priyamvada, L. ∙ Hudson, W. ∙ Ahmed, R. ... Humoral cross-reactivity between Zika and dengue viruses: implications for protection and pathology Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2017; 6 :e33 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). An ideal vaccine should therefore protect simultaneously against all four DENVs as well as ZIKV.
Only the members of a special class of human broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the so-called E dimer epitope (EDE) have been shown to potently neutralize ZIKV and the four DENV serotypes ( Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016 2. Barba-Spaeth, G. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Rouvinski, A. ...

Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). C10, whose in vivo protective effect has been demonstrated ( Swanstrom et al., 2016 49. Swanstrom, J.A. ∙ Plante, J.A. ∙ Plante, K.S. ... Dengue Virus Envelope Dimer Epitope Monoclonal Antibodies Isolated from Dengue Patients Are Protective against Zika Virus MBio. 2016; 7 e01123-16 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and C8 are among the broadest neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the EDE. Their footprints on the DENV2 and ZIKV E dimer have been structurally defined ( Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016 2. Barba-Spaeth, G. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Rouvinski, A. ... Structural basis of potent Zika-dengue virus antibody cross-neutralization Nature. 2016; 536 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rouvinski et al., 2015 44. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ∙ Barba-Spaeth, G. ... Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2016 58. Zhang, S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). The epitopes are distributed evenly at the surface of the icosahedral virion, which is composed of 90 E dimers organized in 30 “rafts” of three parallel E dimers ( Figure 1 B; Kuhn et al., 2002 27. Kuhn, R.J. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Rossmann, M.G. ... Structure of dengue virus: implications for flavivirus organization, maturation, and fusion Cell. 2002; 108 :717-725 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1271) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 15 icosahedral 2-fold (I2) axes of the particle intersect two diametrically opposed rafts. The molecular 2-fold symmetry axis of the central E dimer (termed “I2 dimer”) in each raft is coincident with an I2 axis, and the flanking E dimers are related only by a local molecular 2-fold axis (L2 dimers) ( Figure 1 B). One end of the L2 dimer makes inter-raft contacts about the 5-fold (I5) and the other about the 3-fold (I3) icosahedral axes. The environments of the two EDEs of the L2 dimers, termed “ 5f ” and “ 3f ,” are therefore non-equivalent, whereas they are equivalent (termed “ 2f ”) on the I2 dimers ( Figure 1 B, magenta circles).
Here we explored the structural features that confer antibodies targeting the EDE to such an exceptional breadth. We found that antibody binding geometry is as important as core epitope conservation in conferring broad cross-neutralization. Indeed, despite the relatively even cross-neutralization of bivalent C10 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) for ZIKV and the four DENV serotypes, the monovalent C10 antigen binding fragment (Fab) retains neutralization potency only for ZIKV and DENV1. We also show that the C10 paratope is robust to amino acid changes with respect to binding and neutralization potency against ZIKV and DENV1 but not for the other three viruses. In addition, the X-ray structures of C10 in complex with sE from the five viruses it neutralizes showed that, contrary to ZIKV and DENV1, C10 binding stabilized an asymmetric conformation of DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 sE dimers, with only one of the two epitopes in a conformation compatible with the interactions of E on virions. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies showed that a C10 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) could bind only one of the two epitopes on the L2 dimer on the DENV2 virion, either 3f or 5f , and did not bind the I2 dimers. Furthermore, the X-ray structure of ZIKV sE in complex with a bivalent immunoglobulin hinted at its mode of bivalent binding to virions. The accompanying paper by Lim et al. (2021) 29. Lim, X.X. ∙ Shu, B. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Human antibody C10 neutralizes by diminishing Zika but enhancing dengue virus dynamics Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar in this issue of Cell confirms the bivalent binding mode to the two 3f epitopes per raft and further reveals that C10 binding to the DENV2 virion causes increased hydrogen-deuterium exchange of E protein peptides spanning the epitope, in line with sE dimer distortion revealed by the X-ray structures. Our results show that the gained avidity acquired by bivalent binding largely compensates for the lower affinity of the monovalent Fab arms to the DENV2 E dimer (and, by extrapolation, to DENV3 and DENV4, which display the same epitope organization) as well as for the limited accessibility to only one of the epitopes on L2 dimers.

Section: Results

We carried out in vitro binding and neutralization experiments in parallel using C10 intact bivalent IgG1, bivalent F(ab’) 2 , and monovalent Fab ( Figure 1 C). The concentration of bivalent C10 required for 50% reduction of infection (IC 50 ) of ZIKV and DENV1–DENV4 was in the range of 0.1–4 nM. The monovalent Fab IC 50 remained in this range for ZIKV and DENV1 but not for DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4, for which it was nearly two logs higher ( Figure 1 C). The differences in neutralization potency correlated with a significant increase in avidity of the bivalent binders for the latter three viruses. Indeed, the measured C10 IgG half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) for virion binding was under a factor of 3 for bivalent versus monovalent binders in the case of ZIKV and DENV1, but it was 10 times higher for DENV2 and DENV4 and almost two logs for DENV3. In contrast, the IC 50 of bivalent C10 for ZIKV, DENV2, and DENV4 was below 0.5 nM, whereas it was 1 nM and 5 nM for DENV1 and DENV3, respectively. In some of the experiments reported in Figure 1 C, the curves for Fab C10 do not reach a plateau, and the inferred EC 50 s and IC 50 s are not reliable. However, because the experiments were all done in parallel on the same cells, they clearly show that the monovalent Fab curves are considerably shifted to the right, whereas this shift is less pronounced in the case of ZIKV and DENV1. A high avidity of the bivalent binders therefore appears to be responsible for the low IC 50 of C10 for DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4.
C10 underwent modest somatic hypermutation: the amino acid (aa) sequence identities of the heavy and light chain with the corresponding inferred germlines are 95.9% and 89.8%, respectively ( Figure S1 A). None of the reversions to the V H gene sequence significantly affected binding or neutralization, neither individually nor in combination ( Figure 2 A, top panel; Table S1 ). In contrast, five of 10 individual reversions in the light chain did reduce neutralization breadth ( Figure 2 A, center panel). Only the combined reversion to germline of all somatic mutations in the light chain knocked down binding to all five viruses.
We further alanine-scanned C10 in or near the paratope ( Figure S1 B), as informed by the structure of the DENV2 sE/C10 complex ( Rouvinski et al., 2015 44. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ∙ Barba-Spaeth, G. ... Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). The single mutations that knocked out neutralization of all five virus were Y H100C A, Y L32 A, and T L52 A. The side chains of these three residues are important for organizing the paratope ( Figures S1 C–S1E). Of the heavy-chain residues that contact the epitope, mutations P H100F A and L H100H A affected neutralization breadth without significantly altering ZIKV or DENV1 neutralization. Only turning the whole HCDR3 into a polyalanine stretch knocked out binding to all five viruses, highlighting the robustness of the paratope to point mutations, with stronger effects in neutralization of DENV3 and DENV4.
We used C10 Fab and scFv to obtain crystals in complex with sE from ZIKV, DENV1, DENV3, and DENV4 (see the sE aa sequence alignment in Figure S2 A). We determined the corresponding X-ray structures to 2.1-, 2.8-, 3.2-, and 2.7-Å resolution, respectively ( Figure S2 B; Table S2 ) by molecular replacement. The crystals of ZIKV and DENV1 had one sE/C10 protomer in the asymmetric unit (AU), and a crystallographic 2-fold axis generated a symmetric sE dimer bound to two antibody fragments: Fab and scFv, respectively. The DENV3 and DENV4 crystals instead contained one sE dimer with two scFv C10 bound in the AU, with considerable differences at the two antibody-antigen interfaces within the dimer ( Table S3 ). As discussed below, these data allowed comparative structural analysis of a total of 10 independent snapshots, each consisting of half an (sE/C10 V ) 2 dimer, where C10 V denotes the antibody variable portion made of domains V H and V L of the heavy and light chains, irrespective of the presence of Fab or scFv in the crystals. These half-dimer snapshots are as follows: one each for the ZIKV and DENV1 complexes, two each for DENV3 and DENV4, and four for the previously reported structure of the DENV2 complex (PDB: 4UT9 ), which featured two (sE/scFv) 2 dimers in the crystal AU ( Rouvinski et al., 2015 44. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ∙ Barba-Spaeth, G. ... Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). The loops from C10 complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in interaction with sE in each of these snapshots are displayed in Figures S4 A–S4F. Figure 3 A shows an alignment of these 10 snapshots on the C10 backbone.
The C10 V backbone remained essentially the same in all complexes ( Figures 3 A and 3B), although some bulky side chains of the paratope exhibited significantly different rotamers ( Figure 3 B). This variability in side-chain conformation is in line with the observed robustness of the C10 paratope presented in Figure 2 : mutation of residues with low side-chain root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) affected binding and neutralization breadth whereas mutation of residues with variable rotamers did not. Alignment on the C10 V backbone also brought into alignment the epitope region, where the RMSD between Cα atoms of the epitope increased with distance to the paratope ( Figure 3 C). We defined the C10 epitope “core” as the E protein regions in which the RMSDs remained similar to that of the C10 V Cα atoms used in the alignment. As expected, the core epitope included the region of the b strand and the fusion loop at the tip of domain II of the reference subunit (colored red in Figure 3 C). The epitope periphery, shown in yellow in Figure 3 C, includes the ij hairpin, which is also part of the domain II tip ( Figure 1 A) and is mobile in the structures, as well as the E protein atoms of the opposite subunit. Residues in the epitope periphery adjust differently in each complex to conform to the paratope.
Structural alignment of the X-ray snapshots above onto the core epitope of E in the available cryo-EM structures of the ZIKV virion at 3.1-Å resolution ( Sevvana et al., 2018 48. Sevvana, M. ∙ Long, F. ∙ Miller, A.S. ... Refinement and Analysis of the Mature Zika Virus Cryo-EM Structure at 3.1 Å Resolution Structure. 2018; 26 :1169-1177.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) and of the DENV2 virion at 2.6-Å resolution ( Hardy et al., 2021 21. Hardy, J.M. ∙ Newton, N.D. ∙ Modhiran, N. ... A unified route for flavivirus structures uncovers essential pocket factors conserved across pathogenic viruses Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :3266 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that the symmetric ZIKV and DENV1 (sE/C10 V ) 2 half-dimers well matched the conformation of E on the virion. In contrast, only one of the two half-dimers of the asymmetric complexes was compatible with the conformation of E on virions ( Figures S2 C and S2D). The epitope periphery of the second binding site showed clashes in each case with the underlying M protein or the E stem. For the purpose of our descriptions below, we termed the two half-dimer snapshots per asymmetric dimer sites 1 and 2 to mean the compatible and non-compatible epitope with the interactions on the virion, respectively.
To understand the binding of C10 in the context of the virus particle, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the DENV2 virion in complex with C10 scFv ( Figures 4 A and S3 A). We obtained a cryo-EM map to ∼3.3-Å overall resolution ( Figure S3 B), with the M/E glycoprotein shell well resolved. We found interpretable density for the scFv bound to the 5f and 3f epitopes ( Figure S3 C) but not at the 2f site. Instead, the cryo-EM density for the 150 loop of E at the 2f site was clear, and we could build it readily ( Figure S3 C). C10 binding has been shown in previous structural studies to induce disorder in the 150 loop ( Rouvinski et al., 2015 44. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ∙ Barba-Spaeth, G. ... Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ), as confirmed here in the X-ray structures reported ( Figure S2 B). This was indeed the case for the L2 dimer, where we found no density for the 150 loop and could build the C10 scFv instead. Despite a resolution gradient that resulted in poorer definition for the distal end of the scFv, most of the side chains in the paratope were well resolved, as were those in E and M in the virion ( Figures S3 C and S4 G). Comparison of the level of the cryo-EM density of the CDRs bound to the 3f and 5f sites showed that it was about 50% that of the E protein, indicating that each binding site had only half occupancy despite a stoichiometric excess of C10 scFv over E protein when preparing the complex for cryo-EM ( STAR Methods ). In contrast, the previously reported cryo-EM reconstruction of the ZIKV virion in complex with Fab C10 determined to ∼4-Å resolution ( Zhang et al., 2016 58. Zhang, S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) showed even coverage of the particle, with the Fabs bound at all three non-equivalent epitopes ( 2f , 3f , and 5f , labeled in Figure 1 B), which is in line with the symmetric, undistorted sE dimer observed here in the X-ray structure of the ZIKV sE/C10 complex.
The DENV2/C10 scFv cryo-EM map further showed that, as in the complex with ZIKV, the antigen/antibody contact region extended into the adjacent dimers at the particle surface, with the footprint at the 3f epitope augmented by contacts of the C10 light chain with E domain II of the I2 dimer in the raft (intra-raft extension), whereas the footprint at the 5f epitope also showed contacts with domains I and III of the L2 and I2 dimers, respectively, of the anti-clockwise 5-fold related raft (inter-raft extension) ( Figure 4 B; see also Figure 1 B). The same residues of the C10 light-chain framework region 3 (LFR3) are responsible for the interactions in both extensions, but the antigen residues contacted in each case are not chemically similar ( Figures S3 D and S3E). The lateral contacts of the C10 LFR3 thus appear to be only accessory and are not binding determinants, as demonstrated by mutagenesis of the C10-interacting residues ( Figure S3 F). Only mutation of K L66 , which also positions the LCDR1 for recognition of the fusion loop in the epitope core ( Figure S3 G), entailed a reduction in neutralization breadth ( Figure S3 F; Table S1 ). Biolayer interferometry (BLI) experiments using recombinant DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 sE dimers further confirmed that the affinity of the K L66 A C10 mAb mutant dropped by more than 1 log, whereas it was affected only by a factor of 2 for ZIKV ( Figure S3 H). Because the sE dimers in solution are not expected to follow the raft arrangement of mature virions, these results demonstrate that, although the observed contacts to adjacent dimers may help C10 lock the E protein in the rafts in its pre-fusion conformation, as suggested by Zhang et al. (2016) 58. Zhang, S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , the contacts at these epitope extensions are not binding determinants and do not contribute to the C10 neutralization breadth.
Comparison of the cryo-EM structures in complex with the ZIKV and DENV2 virions indicated that C10 approaches the E protein in slightly different ways depending on the epitope location on the particle ( 3f , 2f , and 5f ; Figure 5 A), although the difference is smaller than in the case of the complexes with sE observed by X-ray crystallography ( Figure 3 A; compare the spread between domain III atoms at the opposite end of the dimer: 17.5 Å versus 37.6 Å) upon superposition of the C10 V backbone only ( Table S4 ). The angle of approach in each case is seen better by comparing the docking axes as defined in Figure 5 B ( Table S5 ). Docking of C10 on the E dimer observed in the crystal structure of the ZIKV sE/C10 complex is essentially the same as that on the 3f epitope on the ZIKV virion. On the DENV2 virion, only the docking axes at the 3f and 5f epitopes are visualized. They are tilted away from the glycan linked to Asn67 (pink star in Figure 5 B), which is absent in ZIKV and influences the way C10 approaches the virus particle. This is highlighted by the docking axis on the ZIKV 5f epitope, which shows that C10 adjusts to the contacts with the neighboring raft by tilting toward this position, which is forbidden by the presence of the glycan in the DENV particles ( Figure 5 B, left panel). Comparison with the X-ray structures of the sE/C10 complexes showed a subset of docking axes, most often only on one side of the sE dimer for the asymmetric structures, that remain similar to those seen on virions ( Figure 5 B, center panel). We found that the docking axes outside the oval represented in Figure 5 B lead to clashes with the underlying E stem region and with protein M, as illustrated in Figures S2 C and S2D. A further analysis of the X-ray structures of DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 sE bound to C10 showed that its relatively long C10 HCDR3 loop wedges differently at the sE dimer interface in the three viruses, interacting with residues that are only partially accessible on the virion. In particular, the HCDR3 alters the conformation of the ij hairpin within the reference subunit and also that of the kl hairpin across the sE dimer interface ( Figure S5 ). Both of these hairpins are affected in most of the snapshots. The C10 HCDR3 thus appears to knock on long-distance effects that alter the second epitope in the dimer. For further comparison, we obtained the X-ray structures of the DENV3 sE dimer in complex with Fab C8 ( Figure S2 E; Table S2 ), which targets the same epitope. Comparison with the available structures of ZIKV (PDB: 5LBS ) and DENV2 (PDB: 4UTA ) sE in complex with Mab C8 showed an undistorted, symmetric dimer with a narrow clustering of the C8 docking axes ( Figure 5 B, right panel). The differences in HCDR3 length of the two antibodies ( Figure 5 C) is likely responsible for the observed distortion when C10 binds E of DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4.
The absence of C10 density at the 2f epitopes on the DENV2 virions led us to more closely examine the contacts made by the central I2 dimer with its neighbors within a raft, in light of the asymmetric conformation observed in the X-ray structures. A central feature of the I2/L2 interdimer contacts is the interaction between the hh’ hairpin with the long bc loop, which includes the n1 3/10 helical turn, of the opposite E dimer ( Figure 6 A). In the E protein, the hh’ hairpin connects directly to the ij hairpin, which, in turn, is linked directly to the α2 helix, which mediates intra-dimer contacts. In turn, the α2 helix immediately precedes the kl hairpin, which controls the hinging of domain II with respect to domain I. Figure 6 A displays the polypeptide segment in between hh’ and kl hairpins in a color ramp from the N to the C terminus to highlight its central location in the E dimer and its position within the C10 epitope. This segment appears as a key element of the spring-loaded architecture of the E dimers in their metastable pre-fusion conformation on virions.
The buried surface area (BSA) at the contact between I2 and L2 E dimers in the virion is more than 2,000 Å 2 per dimer and also involves inter-dimer contacts between domains I and III (red and blue domains, respectively, in Figure 1 B). The extent of the buried surface suggests an intrinsic inter-dimer affinity, which is reflected in the packing in the ZIKV sE/Fab C10 crystals, which showed sE dimers packed laterally through the same interfaces as in the virion rafts. The BSA is smaller (1,200 Å 2 ; Figures 6 B and 6C), but the packing maintains the central hh’ / bc loop contacts. With the sE dimers being less curved than E dimers on virions ( Figures 6 B and 6C, left two columns), the packing in the crystals resulted in straight rows of dimers extending indefinitely. In the DENV2 sE/C10 X-ray structure (PDB: 4UT9 ), one of the two complexes of the AU also displayed sE dimers packing via the same interface as I2 and L2 dimers on virions ( Figure 6 E), resulting in similar straight rows but with the notable difference that C10 binding introduced a distortion that abrogated the 2-fold symmetry of the contact and reduced the BSA to 450 Å 2 . The bc loop and the hh’ hairpin still faced each other but were at different heights so that the n 1 turn could not make the same interactions as on virions, resulting in looser contacts (compare Figures 6 D and 6E). Although the docking axes of C10 on of the two epitopes of the DENV2/C10 complex (sites 1 and 2; Figures 5 B, S4 , and S5 ) remained in the allowed region ( Figure 5 B), the sE conformation adopted upon C10 binding at both epitopes interfered with formation of raft-like lateral contacts. Figure S2 A shows that only in the case of DENV2 are residues of the n 1 turn among those contacted by C10, suggesting that there is a specific rearrangement in this intra-raft contact region to adjust to the C10 paratope. This observed distortion is in line with the increase in hydrogen-deuterium exchange of DENV2 particles in peptides spanning this polypeptide segment upon C10 binding described by Lim et al. (2021) 29. Lim, X.X. ∙ Shu, B. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Human antibody C10 neutralizes by diminishing Zika but enhancing dengue virus dynamics Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar . It is also in line with the observation of undetectable C10 binding to the I2 dimers on the virion, which have symmetrical hh’ hairpin/ bc loop contacts with L2 dimers at either side and are therefore less likely to sample asymmetrical E dimer conformations that can be selected by C10, unlike the L2 dimers.
The immunoglobulins’ heavy chain CH1-CH2 hinge is 17-aa-long in human IgG1 and consists of a 4-residue core with the sequence H222 CPPC H225 (Kabat numbering), with the two cysteines making inter-heavy-chain disulfide bonds ( Figure S6 A). The IgG1 F(ab’) 2 remains dimeric because it is truncated downstream of the CPPC core, whereas the Fab is truncated upstream. We studied the biophysical properties of the ZIKV sE dimer in complex with bivalent C10 IgG1 or F(ab’) 2 . Size-exclusion chromatography together with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicated that the complexes essentially had a stoichiometry of two IgG1 or F(ab’) 2 C10 bound to two ZIKV sE dimers (2:2 stoichiometry; Figure S6 B, top panel). We did not observe a peak corresponding to a 1:1 sE/F(ab’) 2 complex, suggesting that C10 cannot bind bivalently to a single E dimer. We found the same behavior with mAb C8 ( Figure 6 B, bottom panel, left). As a control, we also monitored, by SEC-MALS, mAb P6B10, which targets the linear fusion loop epitope (FLE) ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2015 8. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Wongwiwat, W. ∙ Supasa, S. ... A new class of highly potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from viremic patients infected with dengue virus Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16 :170-177 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ), in complex with ZIKV sE. The elution profile corresponded to a stoichiometry of one IgG1 for two sE monomers, confirming that, in solution, P6B10 dissociates the ZIKV sE dimer to access the fusion loop and binds an sE monomer per Fab arm ( Figure S6 B, bottom panel, right). Negative-stain EM analysis and 2D class averaging of the ZIKV sE/C10 F(ab’) 2 complex showed images compatible with two sE dimers crosslinked by a F(ab’) 2 molecule and, in some cases, three sE dimers with three F(ab’) 2 s ( Figure S6 C), corroborating that C10 cannot bind bivalently to a single sE dimer.
We obtained crystals of ZIKV sE in complex with C10 IgG and with F(ab’) 2 that diffracted to 6-Å and 3-Å resolution, respectively, and determined the X-ray structure of the latter by molecular replacement ( Table S2 ). The lateral packing between sE dimers was identical to that observed in the ZIKV sE/Fab complex ( Figure S6 B), but the Fab arms had a different elbow angle ( Figure S7 A). Although the antibody hinge region had weak density, it was possible to trace the H217 DKTHT H221 sequence of the upstream tether, which converged into a blob of density at the 2-fold axis that we assigned to the first inter-chain disulfide bond of the hinge core segment ( Figure S7 B). Because the density was weak, we re-dissolved the crystals and monitored them by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, which confirmed that they indeed contained an intact F(ab’) 2 molecule ( Figure 7 A), ruling out any potential fortuitous cleavage in the linker region prior to crystal formation. Moreover, the two Fab arms connected by the weak density in the crystal were the only ones having the density for C H216 Cα atoms at the Fab C termini positioned within a distance range compatible with the hinge length ( Figure S7 D), supporting our interpretation of the bivalent binding mode.
The structure showed that the two arms of the C10 F(ab’) 2 were bound to alternating sE dimers along raft-like rows ( Figure 7 A). When extrapolated to the virion, this result indicated that the two arms of bivalent IgG1 C10 can crosslink the two 3f epitopes of each raft ( Figure 7 B). The curved surface on the virion compared with the flat E rows in the crystal would bring the C H216 Cα atoms of the two Fab arms farther apart, indicating that the hinge requires farther stretching than in the crystals, potentially requiring further Fab flexing about the elbow angle to keep the C10 V moiety unaltered on the epitope (compare the right panels of Figures 7 A and 7B). Examination of the available Fab structures in the protein database indicated that the required adjustment is within the range of accessible elbow angles ( Figures 7 B, S7 C, and S7D). This bivalent binding model indicates that 30 C10 IgG1s can completely coat a mature particle, one per raft ( Figure 7 C; Video S1 ), a number that has been shown to be sufficient to neutralize the particle ( Pierson et al., 2007 39.

Model of the binding of IgG1 C10 to ZIKV, related to Figure 7B
Analysis of the IgG1 hinge ( Figures S6 A, S7C, and S7D) shows that the distance between the C H216 Cα atoms from the two Fab arms within an IgG1 molecule must be under 50 Å. Considering the additional flexibility provided by the Fab elbow angles ( Figure S7 E), only the two 3f epitopes can be bound bivalently because the other potential bivalent binding involve the 2f epitopes ( Figures S7 E and S7F), which, as shown by our cryo-EM data, are not occupied. We conclude that binding to the two 3f epitopes of each raft is the mode of binding and neutralization of IgG C10. The poor affinity of monovalent Fab binding suggests that the other epitopes will dissociate quickly and that only the antibodies bound bivalently at the 3f epitopes will remain stably bound on DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 particles. The fact that C10 IgG1 and F(ab’) 2 neutralize DENV2 and DENV4 as strongly as ZIKV ( Figure 1 C) indicates that 30 C10 mAbs bound bivalently to each of the rafts are sufficient for neutralization. Full occupancy of the 3f epitopes leaves the 5f sites accessible to monovalent binding, in line with our attempts to make a cryo-EM reconstruction of DENV2 particles with C10 F(ab’) 2 , which resulted in precipitation of the sample, indicating that C10 can cross-link virus particles via the 5f epitopes ( Figure S7 G).

Section: Discussion

Beyond the insight into the mechanism of cross-reactivity of C10, our analysis of the conformations of the E protein in solution and on virions in complex or not with C10, the details of which are provided in Figure S5 , reveals key features to understand the intrinsic, functional conformational dynamics of E. These studies indicate that, in solution, sE displays a broad conformational landscape, sampling symmetric and asymmetric conformations. In the case of ZIKV and DENV1, the antibody can bind and stabilize a symmetric conformation of sE that is likely to be the most populated one. In the case of DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4, C10 binding selects for a presumably less populated asymmetric conformation, in line with the affinity studies ( Figure 1 C). Our analysis further indicates that such asymmetric states have altered intra-dimer contacts around the bound C10 HCDR3 loop. One affected element is the kl hairpin in the hinge between domains I and II of the opposite subunit in the dimer, which is known to have a long-range effect by altering the interactions at the distal tip ( Zhang et al., 2004 56. Zhang, Y. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Ogata, S. ... Conformational changes of the flavivirus E glycoprotein Structure. 2004; 12 :1607-1618 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ) located at the second epitope of the E dimer. Stochastically, then, the first binding event to one of the two epitopes results in a discreet change that allosterically affects the second epitope, which, we hypothesize, makes it even less optimal for binding. Further C10 binding to the second site selects for an sE conformation that appears to be accessible in solution but not on virions. With the I2 dimer being symmetrically constrained at the center of the virion raft, it does not sample the same conformational landscape as sE in solution and therefore cannot adopt a conformation that can be selected for C10 binding. Furthermore, C10 binding also affects the conformation of the I2/L2 interface on virion rafts in the case of DENV2 but not ZIKV ( Figure 6 ). Similarly, the L2 dimer goes half of the way, sampling enough conformations so that C10 can select for the required asymmetric form, but in the environment on the virion, the second epitope cannot sample an even further asymmetric conformation so that C10 can bind, as in solution. As a result, we see C10 bound only with half occupancy to the L2 dimers ( Figure S2 C), and the predicted asymmetric state stabilized by C10 binding is not detected because of the icosahedral averaging to determine the structure. This asymmetric state of the DENV2 L2 dimer is expected to deviate less from a symmetric dimer than it does in the X-ray structures, in which both epitopes are occupied by C10.
Our extensive analysis of the allosteric effects of the C10 HCDR3 inserting at the dimer interface in the DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 sE dimers ( Figure S5 ) identified the ij hairpin as a potential sensitive element of a mechanism evolved by the virus to react to its environment and induce membrane fusion. The strictly conserved histidine in the ij hairpin (H249 in ZIKV; H244 in DENV1, DENV2, and DENV4; and H242 in DENV3; Figure S2 A) has already been identified as essential for pH sensing ( Kroschewski et al., 2009 25. Kroschewski, H. ∙ Sagripanti, J.L. ∙ Davidson, A.D. Identification of amino acids in the dengue virus type 2 envelope glycoprotein critical to virus infectivity J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90 :2457-2461 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2010 59. Zheng, A. ∙ Umashankar, M. ∙ Kielian, M. In vitro and in vivo studies identify important features of dengue virus pr-E protein interactions PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6 :e1001157 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we made the unanticipated observation that the long HCDR3 loop of C10, which is nicely complementary to the C10 epitope in ZIKV and DENV1, in the other viruses is not. It instead selects an alternative conformation of the ij hairpin, which, in turn, affects the overall state of the E dimer and probably also its interactions on the virion because it appears to also affect the hh’ hairpin at the L2/I2 dimer interface ( Figure 6 ). The kl hairpin adopts variable conformations, being also often disordered in structures of unbound sE, which relate to the curvature of the sE dimers in each structure. In contrast, Figure S5 shows that the ij hairpin is affected only in the structures bound by C10. Attempts to force C10 binding to all its available epitopes per DENV2 particle by raising the temperature on a DENV2 strain that has been shown to change the surface packing of dimers with temperature ( Fibriansah et al., 2013 13.

Dengue structure differs at the temperatures of its human and mosquito hosts Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :6795-6799 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) induces particle distortion, as described by Lim et al. (2021) 29. Lim, X.X. ∙ Shu, B. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Human antibody C10 neutralizes by diminishing Zika but enhancing dengue virus dynamics Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar . These observations point to a potential effect of the C10 HCDR3 that partially releases the spring-loading mechanism by acting on the ij hairpin ( Figure 6 A). The very presence of C10 precludes the full fusogenic conformational change of E to proceed, as when triggered by acid pH. Lim et al. (2021) 29. Lim, X.X. ∙ Shu, B. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Human antibody C10 neutralizes by diminishing Zika but enhancing dengue virus dynamics Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar show that C10 indeed precludes particle aggregation by exposure of the fusion loops when treated at acid pH, but the aborted triggering of the conformational change leads to DENV2 particle distortion by altering the E dimer conformation.
A number of studies have reported human antibodies cross-neutralizing ZIKV and DENV1, in particular antibodies targeting domain III ( Keeffe et al., 2018 23. Keeffe, J.R. ∙ Van Rompay, K.K.A. ∙ Olsen, P.C. ...

Recurrent Potent Human Neutralizing Antibodies to Zika Virus in Brazil and Mexico Cell. 2017; 169 :597-609.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rogers et al., 2017 43. Rogers, T.F. ∙ Goodwin, E.C. ∙ Briney, B. ... Zika virus activates de novo and cross-reactive memory B cell responses in dengue-experienced donors Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaan6809 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The EDE antibodies are the only ones that expand cross-reactivity to include viruses of the other three DENV serotypes. Our results show that, affinity-wise, ZIKV and DENV1 indeed appear to be more closely related antigenically ( Figures 1 C and 2 ), despite the fact that bivalent C10 neutralizes DENV2 and DENV4 better than it does DENV1. However, C10 achieves its broader neutralization spectrum not via increased affinity for the more antigenically different viruses ( Figure 1 C). The geometry of the dengue virion makes that once bound to a 3f site on a raft, and the second Fab arm is directed to make favorable interactions with the second 3f site on the same raft, and such bivalently bound antibodies are likely to remain tightly bound, whereas monovalently bound C10 mAbs will be prone to rapid dissociation from DENV2 virions. Stretching the hinge and adapting the elbow angle of the Fab arms to accommodate the docking axes of the two Fab arms for bivalent binding thus has a major effect on antibody function, as demonstrated here for mAb C10. Because C8 shows similar docking axes ( Figure 5 B, right panel), the implications are that its expanded neutralization range is due to the same mechanism.
The EDE antibodies were cloned from plasmablasts of individuals in Vietnam who were hospitalized for dengue disease in November-December 2009. ZIKV became a global problem later, but there are a number of reports indicating that ZIKV had been circulating in South-East Asia for decades before reaching Polynesia and then jumping to South America ( Ruchusatsawat et al., 2019 46. Ruchusatsawat, K. ∙ Wongjaroen, P. ∙ Posanacharoen, A. ... Long-term circulation of Zika virus in Thailand: an observational study Lancet Infect. Dis. 2019; 19 :439-446 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wikan and Smith, 2017 53. Wikan, N. ∙ Smith, D.R. Zika virus from a Southeast Asian perspective Asian Pac. J. Trop. Med. 2017; 10 :1-5 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results suggest that the individuals from whom the antibodies were isolated may have been primed by a ZIKV infection. Because in South-East Asia all four DENV serotypes circulate, it is possible that they had been further affinity matured for DENV2 and DENV4, given that they neutralize these two DENV serotypes as strongly as ZIKV. Although C10 affinity maturation is limited, we show here ( Figure 2 ) that the light chain contains somatic mutations that are crucial for their cross-reactivity beyond ZIKV and DENV1.
Structural analyses of Fab antigen complexes, although highly informative, may underestimate the complexity of binding of bivalent antibodies to repetitive epitopes found on the surface of infectious pathogens. The structural rearrangements of Fab and E protein to accommodate bivalent binding and endow broadly neutralizing activity are remarkable. To develop an efficient vaccine eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies against flaviviruses, it is not only complementarity to the epitope that is important but also the relative location of the epitopes targeted; i.e., the way in which they are presented at the immunogen’s surface. This study therefore raises interest in devising scaffolds to provide epitope presentation as similar to the mature viral particles as possible.
Mixing bivalent C10 immunoglobulin with DENV2 virions under the conditions required for cryo-EM resulted in massive aggregation, precluding direct cryo-EM visualization of the bivalent binding observed in the crystals reported here. Lim et al. (2021) 29. Lim, X.X. ∙ Shu, B. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Human antibody C10 neutralizes by diminishing Zika but enhancing dengue virus dynamics Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar , however, report a cryo-EM reconstruction of bivalent C10 F(ab’) 2 bound as proposed here by capturing DENV2 virions on an EM grid and then adding more F(ab’) 2 to further coat the particles. Although the resulting reconstruction did not directly visualize the IgG1 linker connecting the two Fab arms, the elbow angle of the bound Fab bent to match the predicted angle required for bivalent binding. Similar experiments using Fab instead of F(ab’) 2 showed a very different, straight elbow angle, supporting the conclusion that bivalent binding to the 3 f epitopes of each pair of L2 dimers per raft is what allows the very broad neutralization spectrum of Mab C10.

To compare the activity of EDE1 C10 antibody with germline sequence and contact residues of EDE1 C10 to epitope, heavy chain and light chain of EDE1 C10 were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis.

Briefly, EDE1 C10 expressing plasmids were subjected to Platinum® Pfx DNA Polymerase PCR mix (11708-013; Invitrogen) with specific primers which were designed by using QuikChange® Primer Design Program. PCR products were purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (28104; QIAGEN) and treated with DpnI (R0176S; NEB) to remove parental plasmid DNA. PCR products were transformed into E.coli . All mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into the 293T cell lines by Polyethylenimine method and culture supernatants were harvested for binding and neutralization assay.

Barba-Spaeth, G. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Rouvinski, A. ...

Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, sE expression was induced by addition of 5 μM CuSO4 or CdCl2 and supernatants were harvested after 8–10 days post-induction. sE were purified using Streptactin columns (IBA) according to manufacturer’s instructions followed by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated in 50 mM Tris (pH 8) and 500 mM NaCl. Disulfide engineered mutant dimers of DENV2 A259C (sE) 2 , DENV3 A257C (sE) 2 , DENV3 L107C/S313C (sE) 2 and DENV4 A259C (sE) 2 were produced as described earlier ( Rouvinski et al., 2017 45. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ... Covalently linked dengue virus envelope glycoprotein dimers reduce exposure of the immunodominant fusion loop epitope Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15411 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ).
C10 and C8 fragments were cloned into plasmids for expression of Fab and scFv in Drosophila S2 cells ( Rouvinski et al., 2015 44. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ∙ Barba-Spaeth, G. ... Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). The constructs contain a tandem strep tag fused at the C terminus (only of the heavy chain in case of the Fab) for affinity purification. The purification protocol included a streptactin affinity column followed by gel filtration as described above. F(ab’) 2 C10 construct was similar to Fab with the only difference that the construct contained extra IgG1 hinge peptide residues at the C terminus of the heavy chain. After streptactin purification, the dimeric F(ab’) 2 was separated from the monomer fraction in gel filtration chromatography and the pure protein was used for assays.
C6/36 cells were cultured at 32°C in the presence of 5% CO2. During cell passaging, we scraped cells from the dish, avoiding exposure of cells to trypsin. Thirty-five Corning tissue-culture treated culture dishes (D × H, 150 mm × 25 mm), each containing C6/36 cells in 30 mL of medium, were infected with DENV-2, New Guinea strain ( Gruenberg et al., 1988 17. Gruenberg, A. ∙ Woo, W.S. ∙ Biedrzycka, A. ... Partial nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the structural proteins of dengue virus type 2, New Guinea C and PUO-218 strains J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69 :1391-1398 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Four days after infection, cell culture medium was collected and was centrifuged for 30 min in a Beckmann centrifuge (11,000 g) to pellet large debris to be discarded. The supernatant harvested was centrifuged for 1 h in 26 × 38.5 mL centrifuge tubes in a Beckmann centrifuge (141,000 g) to collect the virus-containing pellet. The sample was left for 2 h at 4°C and subsequently the centrifuged virus was resuspended in PBS buffer by soaking of the pellet in the buffer for 10 min. The resuspended sample was then loaded at the top of a sucrose gradient (15% to 50%) and was centrifuged for 2 h at 130,000 g (Beckman Coulter SW41) at 4°C. A band was located at about one-third the distance from the top of the gradient. The gradient material above the band was removed with a pipette; then, the virus-containing band was carefully collected with another pipette, or the band was directly collected via a syringe. The collected viral sample (1 ml) was diluted to a volume of ∼12 mL with PBS buffer and an Amicon Ultra filter was used to concentrate the sample. The resulting 50 μL of purified virus was ready for cryo-EM.
Affinity of IgG1 C10 with purified DENV2 A259C (sE) 2 , DENV3 A257C (sE) 2 , DENV4 A259C (sE) 2 and ZIKV (sE) 2 (ZIKV sE is a natural stable dimer) proteins was accessed in real-time using a bio-layer interferometry Octet-Red384 device (Pall ForteBio). We didn’t use the WT DENV1, 2, 3 and 4 sE proteins because these are monomeric in solution and show monomer - dimer equilibrium, which adds to the measured signal and thus interferes with the experiment. We couldn’t produce DENV1 engineered cysteine sE dimer and thus they were not tested here. Anti-human IgG1 capture sensors (Pall ForteBio) were loaded for 10 min at 1,000 rpm shaking speed using IgG1 molecules at 10 μg ml -1 in assay buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8, 250 mM NaCl plus 0.2 mg ml-1 BSA and tween 0.01%). Unbound IgG1 molecules were washed away for 1 min in assay buffer. IgG1 loaded sensors were then incubated at 1,200 rpm in the absence and presence of two-fold serially diluted concentrations of DENV2-4 sE single cysteine mutant proteins and ZIKV sE for 15 min in assay buffer. Molar concentrations were calculated for the sE proteins in a dimeric form. For experiments with WT IgG1 C10, following range antigen concentrations were used: 2.3–300 nM (DENV2 sE dimer), 3.1-400 nM (DENV3 sE dimer) and 4.7-600 nM (DENV4 sE dimer) proteins and 2.3-300 nM (ZIKV sE dimer). For experiments with K66A mutant IgG1 C10, following antigen concentrations were used: 6.3–800 nM (DENV2 sE dimer), 3.1-400 nM (DENV3 sE dimer) and 37.5-4000 nM (DENV4 sE dimer) proteins and 2.3-300 nM (ZIKV sE dimer). Reference binding experiments were carried out in parallel on sensors loaded with control IgG1 mGO53 ( Wardemann et al., 2003 52. Wardemann, H. ∙ Yurasov, S. ∙ Schaefer, A. ... Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors Science. 2003; 301 :1374-1377 Crossref Scopus (1642) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is a non DENV1-4 / ZIKV specific antibody. Operating temperature was maintained at 25°C. The real-time data were analyzed using Scrubber 2.0 (Biologic Software) and Biaevaluation 4.1 (GE Healthcare). Specific signals were obtained by double referencing, that is, subtracting non-specific signals measured on non-specific IgG1-loaded sensors and buffer signals on specific IgG1 loaded sensors. Association profiles, as well as steady-state signal versus concentration curves, were fitted assuming a 1:1 binding model.
The purified antigens were mixed with Fabs or scFvs (in approximately 2-fold molar excess) in standard buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8). Samples were concentrated in Vivaspin 10 kDa cutoff to a volume of 0.5 ml. Post 30 min incubation in ice, the excess Fab/scFv C10 was separated from the antigen-Fab/scFv C10 complex by size exclusion chromatography in 50 Mm Tris (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl. In all cases, buffer was exchanged to 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM Tris pH 8 for crystallization trials. The protein concentrations used for crystallization, determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 mm, are listed in Table S2 .
Crystallization trials were performed in 400 nL sitting drops. The crystallization and cryo-cooling conditions are listed in the Table S2. Drops were formed by mixing equal volumes of the protein and reservoir solution in the format of 96 Greiner plates, using a Mosquito robot, and monitored by a Rock-Imager. Crystals were optimized with a robotized Matrix Maker and Mosquito setups on 400 nL sitting drops or manually in 24-well plates using 2-3 μL hanging drops. The crystals obtained were tested at several beam lines at different synchrotrons: SOLEIL (St Aubin, France) and ESRF (Grenoble, France). The datasets were indexed, integrated, scaled and merged using XDS ( Kabsch, 2010 22. Kabsch, W. Integration, scaling, space-group assignment and post-refinement Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :133-144 Crossref Scopus (1934) PubMed Google Scholar ) and AIMLESS ( Evans and Murshudov, 2013 11. Evans, P.R. ∙ Murshudov, G.N. How good are my data and what is the resolution? Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2013; 69 :1204-1214 Crossref Scopus (3301) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structures were then determined by molecular replacement with PHASER ( McCoy et al., 2007 31. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (16097) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the search models listed in Table S2 . Because of the anisotropy of the DENV3 sE / C8 Fab crystals, the DEBYE and STARANISO programs developed by Global Phasing Ltd. were applied to the AIMLESS scaled data without truncation of the resolution, using the STARANISO server ( https://staraniso.globalphasing.org/ ). These programs perform an anisotropic cut-off of merged intensity data with a Bayesian estimation of the structure amplitudes, and apply an anisotropic correction to the data. These corrected anisotropic amplitudes were then used for further refinement of that structure with PHENIX ( Terwilliger et al., 2009 51. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Adams, P.D. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Decision-making in structure solution using Bayesian estimates of map quality: the PHENIX AutoSol wizard Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65 :582-601 Crossref Scopus (730) PubMed Google Scholar ; Table S2 ). In general, all the models were alternatively manually corrected and completed using COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 10. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25430) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refined using either PHENIX or BUSTER-TNT ( Blanc et al., 2004 5. Blanc, E. ∙ Roversi, P. ∙ Vonrhein, C. ... Refinement of severely incomplete structures with maximum likelihood in BUSTER-TNT Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2210-2221 Crossref Scopus (626) PubMed Google Scholar ). For some structures, the refinements were constrained using non-crystallographic symmetry ( Table S2 ).
SEC-MALS was performed by loading ∼150 ug of ZIKA sE, F(ab)’2 C10, IgG1 C10, IgG1 C8 and IgG1 FLE P6B10 protein into Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE life sciences). Samples were run in Tris 50 mM pH 8.0 and NaCl 500 mM at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min −1 . Sample molecular weight was detected by a Wyatt DAWN Heleos II EOS 18-angle laser photometer coupled to a Wyatt Optilab TrEX differential refractive index detector. Data were later analyzed using Astra 6 software (Wyatt Technology Corp). ZIKV sE / F(ab)’2 C10 complex crystals (∼20 crystals) were fished from the manual drops and serially washed in two drops containing the crystallization solution by transferring crystals to these drops. These washed crystals were loaded with non-reducing SDS-PAGE dye.
Purified ZV sE / F(ab’) 2 C10 complex was negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate on grids coated with carbon film. Six micrographs were then manually recorded on a 4k × 4k CCD camera at 70,000 × magnification with a 10 s pre-exposure in an FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope operated at 200 kV. For 2D image analysis, 1043 particles were picked from the micrographs and reference-free 2D classification were performed with Relion ( Scheres, 2012 47. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate 2D class averages.
Purified virus was mixed with scFv C10 (1:4, vol/vol). The final scFv concentration was 80 μM, ensuring a molar excess to saturate the epitopes on virions. Aliquots of 3 μL of the mixture were placed on glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Cu R2/2), glow-discharged was performed via Gatan Solarus Plasma Cleaner (H 2 &O 2 , 12 s). Grids were blotted for 5 s under 20°C/100% humidity with blot force 4 and were flash frozen in liquid ethane with an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Grids were transferred to an FEI Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV. Images were directly recorded by Leginon with a Gatan K2 Summit detector without energy filter in counting mode on the Titan Krios microscope at a nominal magnification of × 29,000 (which yields a pixel size of 1.28Å), only one image was taken in one hole after one stage shift. Underfocus values in the final K2 dataset ranged from 0.2 μm to 3.5 μm, and 25 frames of each movie were used for later image processing.
Particles were picked with Ethan ( Kivioja et al., 2000 24. Kivioja, T. ∙ Ravantti, J. ∙ Verkhovsky, A. ... Local average intensity-based method for identifying spherical particles in electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131 :126-134 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), 2D classification of particle images was performed with relion, good particles from 2D class averages with distinct transmembrane density across the lipid bilayer of the virion were selected for futher processing. We selected more than 10,000 particles with a box size of 640 pixels from 1,035 micrographs in the final K2 dataset. Contrast transfer function parameters were estimated with CTFFIND4 program for finding contrast transfer functions in electron micrographs. We used cisTEM’s Ab-Initio 3D Reconstruction action to generate a starting model, then we used cisTEM’s 3D Auto Refinement action to get the final map, after one round of defocus & beam tilt refinement. The final resolution of the map reached 3.28Å.
DENV2 envelope and M protein from PDB 7KV8 ( Hardy et al., 2021 21. Hardy, J.M. ∙ Newton, N.D. ∙ Modhiran, N. ... A unified route for flavivirus structures uncovers essential pocket factors conserved across pathogenic viruses Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :3266 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used along with scFv C10 PDB (from our crystal structure reported here- PDB 7A3N ) for initial fitting into the map using chimera. Residues different in DENV2 PDB 7KV8 from our DENV2 strain used here were mutated using coot. Fitted structures were refined using real-space refinement in Phenix ( Terwilliger et al., 2009 51. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Adams, P.D. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Decision-making in structure solution using Bayesian estimates of map quality: the PHENIX AutoSol wizard Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65 :582-601 Crossref Scopus (730) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ramachandran restrains, secondary structure restrains, NCS and a weight of 2.5 was applied during the refinement. Quality of refined models after each cycle were assessed using validation reports generated after refinement. Our final refined model was with 0.05% Ramachandran outliers, 0.44% rotamer outliers, 0.0 Cβ outliers, 12.14 Clash score and a MolProbity ( Williams et al., 2018 54. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: More and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2302) PubMed Google Scholar ) score of 1.79 (please see full validation report for PDB 7CTH for more parameters).
Each complex was analyzed with the CCP4 suite of programs. For intermolecular interactions, the maximal cut-off distance used for the interactions was 4.0 and 4.75 Å for polar and van der Waals contacts, respectively. Multiple sequence alignments were calculated using Clustal W and Clustal C version 2 on the EBI server. The figures were prepared using ESPript ( Robert and Gouet, 2014 42. Robert, X. ∙ Gouet, P. Deciphering key features in protein structures with the new ENDscript server Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 W320-4 Crossref Scopus (4583) Google Scholar ), pyMOL Molecular Graphic System, version 1.8.2.0 (Schrödinger) ( http://pymol.sourceforge.net ) and UCSF Chimera version 1.11 ( Pettersen et al., 2004 37. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Ab sequences were analyzed by Abysis ( http://www.abysis.org/abysis/ ) ( Swindells et al., 2017 50. Swindells, M.B. ∙ Porter, C.T. ∙ Couch, M. ... abYsis: Integrated Antibody Sequence and Structure-Management, Analysis, and Prediction J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 :356-364 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ) and IMGT ( http://www.imgt.org/ ) ( Lefranc et al., 2009 28. Lefranc, M.P. ∙ Giudicelli, V. ∙ Ginestoux, C. ... IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :D1006-D1012 Crossref Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ) websites for mapping CDR/framework regions according to Kabat and IMGT. RMSD calculations for Figure 3 B were performed using ProSMART ( Nicholls et al., 2014 35. Nicholls, R.A. ∙ Fischer, M. ∙ McNicholas, S. ... Conformation-independent structural comparison of macromolecules with ProSMART Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2014; 70 :2487-2499 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). C10 docking axes and epitope RMSD were calculated using both PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC.) and UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 37. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ). The C10 Docking axes were calculated for the beta- barrel part of C10 variable domains for each complex.
The occupancy was measured using a home-made UCSF chimera plugin called MDen, as described earlier ( Liu et al., 2017 30. Liu, Y.T. ∙ Jiang, J. ∙ Bohannon, K.P. ... A pUL25 dimer interfaces the pseudorabies virus capsid and tegument J. Gen. Virol. 2017; 98 :2837-2849 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the relative density ratio between symmetry related scFv C10 molecules ( 3f and 5f ) and the asymmetric unit of DENV2 envelope protein was calculated. The densities of scFv C10 CDRs and E asymmetric unit were first segmented in the unsharpened EM map using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 37. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ). CDRs are defined as residues 26-32, 49-53, and 89-97 (in Kabat numbering) for the light chain, and residues 25-33, 51-57, and 93-102 (Kabat numbering) for the heavy chain. A mask was generated via Relion’s relion_mask_create command aiming for reaching a unified ratio (here 4.2 in this study) between the calculated molecular weight of scFv CDRs or E asymmetric unit (calculated using the ExPASy server- ( Gasteiger et al., 2003 15. Gasteiger, E. ∙ Gattiker, A. ∙ Hoogland, C. ... ExPASy: The proteomics server for in-depth protein knowledge and analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :3784-3788 Crossref Scopus (3984) PubMed Google Scholar )) versus their non-negative density value sum. A relative density value was then calculated using the generated mask and the unsharpened EM map via MDen for each density parts (scFv at 3f , 5f and E asymmetric unit). To estimate the occupancy, scFv C10 values at 3f and 5f were divided by the E protein asymmetric unit value to get the final ratios of ∼55% and 45% at 3f and 5f , respectively.
