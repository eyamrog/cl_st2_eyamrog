Title: A segmentation clock patterns cellular differentiation in a bacterial biofilm


Abstract: Summary

Contrary to multicellular organisms that display segmentation during development, communities of unicellular organisms are believed to be devoid of such sophisticated patterning. Unexpectedly, we find that the gene expression underlying the nitrogen stress response of a developing Bacillus subtilis biofilm becomes organized into a ring-like pattern. Mathematical modeling and genetic probing of the underlying circuit indicate that this patterning is generated by a clock and wavefront mechanism, similar to that driving vertebrate somitogenesis. We experimentally validated this hypothesis by showing that predicted nutrient conditions can even lead to multiple concentric rings, resembling segments. We additionally confirmed that this patterning mechanism is driven by cell-autonomous oscillations. Importantly, we show that the clock and wavefront process also spatially patterns sporulation within the biofilm. Together, these findings reveal a biofilm segmentation clock that organizes cellular differentiation in space and time, thereby challenging the paradigm that such patterning mechanisms are exclusive to plant and animal development.

Section: Introduction

Multicellular organisms are well-known for displaying a complex patterning of cell types during their development. For example, the formation of somites in vertebrates (somitogenesis) is primarily driven by cell-autonomous oscillations that arise from genetic circuits ( Henry et al., 2002 13.

As the organism grows, these oscillations freeze in place and create spatially repeating patterns of cellular differentiation. In this way, temporal oscillations are converted into spatially repeating patterns. This mechanism of spatial patterning during development is known as a segmentation clock or a clock and wavefront process ( Aulehla et al., 2008 2. Aulehla, A. ∙ Wiegraebe, W. ∙ Baubet, V. ...

Pourquié, O. The segmentation clock: converting embryonic time into spatial pattern Science. 2003; 301 :328-330 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such a patterning mechanism can give rise to repeating structures (segments) that determine somite boundaries. To date, this type of mechanism has only been observed in vertebrates, arthropods, and plants ( Richmond and Oates, 2012 35. Richmond, D.L. ∙ Oates, A.C. The segmentation clock: inherited trait or universal design principle? Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2012; 22 :600-606 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it is thus assumed that such sophisticated patterning mechanisms are not present in “simple” bacterial systems.
Bacterial biofilms are large cellular communities encapsulated in an extracellular matrix that contain cells in distinct physiological and morphological states, including spores. The spatial organization of cell types in biofilms is commonly believed to follow monotonic gradients such as nutrient or oxygen availability ( Nadezhdin et al., 2020 27.

Matrix Production and Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis Biofilms Localize to Propagating Wave Fronts Biophys. J. 2018; 114 :1490-1498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, nitrogen sources are expected to be readily available at the periphery of the biofilm and are assumed to be limited toward the interior of the biofilm ( Figure 1 A) ( Billings et al., 2015 6. Billings, N. ∙ Birjiniuk, A. ∙ Samad, T.S. ... Material properties of biofilms-a review of methods for understanding permeability and mechanics Rep. Prog.

Stewart, P.S. ∙ Franklin, M.J. Physiological heterogeneity in biofilms Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6 :199-210 Crossref Scopus (1668) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since nitrogen limitation can trigger sporulation ( Dawes and Mandelstam, 1970 10. Dawes, I.W. ∙ Mandelstam, J. Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis in continuous culture J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103 :529-535 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), the spatial distribution of spores within the biofilm could be expected to reflect such simple nutrient gradients and therefore be primarily localized at the center of the biofilm. However, since bacteria respond to starvation by inducing the expression of specific genes to mitigate the stress ( Irving et al., 2021 16. Irving, S.E. ∙ Choudhury, N.R. ∙ Corrigan, R.M. The stringent response and physiological roles of (pp)pGpp in bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2021; 19 :256-271 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ; Völker et al., 1999 49.

Microbiol. 2009; 7 :822-827 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ), the relationship between nutrient gradients and the distribution of cell states might not be straightforward. It thus remains unclear whether bacterial activity in biofilms can generate more complex spatial distributions of cellular fates.
Here, we uncovered a clock and wavefront mechanism that patterns the nitrogen stress response and subsequently sporulation during the development of undomesticated bacterial Bacillus subtilis biofilms. We identified the genetic circuit underlying oscillations in the nitrogen stress response that generates the community-level concentric rings of gene expression patterns. Furthermore, we show that these response dynamics result in the patterning (segmentation) of sporulation in space and time during biofilm development. In this way, biofilms can utilize a clock and wavefront mechanism similar to somitogenesis to organize cell types within the biofilm. Our discovery demonstrates that bacterial biofilms employ a developmental patterning mechanism hitherto believed to be exclusive to vertebrate and plant systems.

Section: Results

We began by measuring the spatial profile of the B. subtilis stress response to determine whether it is consistent with the expected monotonic nutrient gradient within a developing biofilm ( Figure 1 A). To measure the nitrogen stress response, we grew a biofilm ( Figures 1 B and 1C) on the surface of an agar pad containing defined minimal media (MSgg). Specifically, we monitored a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter (yellow fluorescent protein, YFP) for the promoter activity of the nasA gene using time-lapse imaging ( Figures 1 D and 1E). The B. subtilis nasA gene encodes a nitrate transporter that is upregulated when nitrogen is limited ( Nakano et al., 1995 28. Nakano, M.M. ∙ Yang, F. ∙ Hardin, P. ... Nitrogen regulation of nasA and the nasB operon, which encode genes required for nitrate assimilation in Bacillus subtilis J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177 :573-579 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). The expression of the nasA promoter thus directly reports the native cellular nitrogen stress response. Counterintuitively, the pattern of nasA expression did not follow a monotonic profile but rather manifested a ring-like pattern within the biofilm that arises after approximately 20 h of growth ( Figures 1 E, 1G, and S1 ).
To exclude potentially trivial explanations for this unexpected nitrogen response pattern, such as differences in cell density and biofilm 3D organization, we constructed a dual-reporter strain that, in addition to P nasA - yfp , also contained a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) reporter expressed from the isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible hyperspank promoter ( Figure 1 D). At full induction (1 mM IPTG), the expression of the hyperspank promoter is constitutive and should report any cell density and 3D structural features of the biofilm. In contrast to nasA expression, we find that P hyperspank expression exhibits a simple spatial profile ( Figures 1 F, 1G, and S1 ), with the fluorescence signal being high at the center and then gradually decreasing toward the edge of the biofilm. The ring-like pattern of the nitrogen stress response therefore cannot be simply explained by differences in cell density or 3D features of the biofilm. The observed ring-like pattern in the nitrogen stress response during biofilm development thus appears to be generated by a regulated process.
To identify the mechanism that could be responsible for the observed ring-like gene expression pattern, we focused on the underlying nitrogen stress response circuit ( Figure 2 A; see Figure S2 A for a detailed circuit diagram). The nitrogen source (glutamine) binds the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS), thereby forming the complex known as feedback-inhibited GS (FBI-GS) ( Deuel and Prusiner, 1974 11. Deuel, T.F. ∙ Prusiner, S. Regulation of glutamine synthetase from Bacillus subtilis by divalent cations, feedback inhibitors, and L-glutamine J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249 :257-264 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). This FBI-GS complex inhibits the activity of the transcriptional regulator TnrA ( Wray et al., 2001 53. Wray, Jr., L.V. ∙ Zalieckas, J.M. ∙ Fisher, S.H. Bacillus subtilis glutamine synthetase controls gene expression through a protein-protein interaction with transcription factor TnrA Cell. 2001; 107 :427-435 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ), which in turn regulates various downstream genes related to nitrogen stress ( Gunka and Commichau, 2012 12. Gunka, K. ∙ Commichau, F.M. Control of glutamate homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis: a complex interplay between ammonium assimilation, glutamate biosynthesis and degradation Mol.

Genome-wide mapping of TnrA-binding sites provides new insights into the TnrA regulon in Bacillus subtilis MicrobiologyOpen. 2015; 4 :423-435 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sonenshein, 2007 40. Sonenshein, A.L. Control of key metabolic intersections in Bacillus subtilis Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5 :917-927 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). The inhibition of TnrA activity by FBI-GS is released under nitrogen stress, as glutamine limitation leads to a decrease in FBI-GS. The resulting higher TnrA activity promotes higher glutamine levels in cells in two distinct ways: first, it activates various nitrogen transporter genes including the nitrate importer gene nasA ( Nakano et al., 1995 28. Nakano, M.M. ∙ Yang, F. ∙ Hardin, P. ... Nitrogen regulation of nasA and the nasB operon, which encode genes required for nitrate assimilation in Bacillus subtilis J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177 :573-579 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, it inhibits the gltAB operon ( Belitsky et al., 2000 5. Belitsky, B.R. ∙ Wray, Jr., L.V. ∙ Fisher, S.H. ... Role of TnrA in nitrogen source-dependent repression of Bacillus subtilis glutamate synthase gene expression J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 :5939-5947 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), which encodes the glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) that consumes glutamine. Once glutamine becomes abundant again, TnrA inhibition through FBI-GS is re-established. Collectively, these interactions comprise a negative feedback loop that regulates the level of intracellular glutamine ( Figure 2 A). We modeled this negative feedback loop acting on glutamine as a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on mass-action kinetics of the underlying chemical reactions ( Figure S2 A; see STAR Methods for details). Our modeling results reveal that the genetic circuit can generate a temporal pulse in the nitrogen stress response ( Figure 2 B).
How can a system convert a temporal pulse into a spatial pattern? A well-known process by which temporal dynamics can be translated into spatial patterns is the clock and wavefront mechanism, which can transduce oscillations into spatially repeating patterns ( Oates et al., 2012 30. Oates, A.C. ∙ Morelli, L.G. ∙ Ares, S. Patterning embryos with oscillations: structure, function and dynamics of the vertebrate segmentation clock Development. 2012; 139 :625-639 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pourquié, 2003 33. Pourquié, O. The segmentation clock: converting embryonic time into spatial pattern Science. 2003; 301 :328-330 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). The clock and wavefront mechanism consists of two necessary components: (1) a cell-autonomous oscillator (the clock), achieved by a negative feedback loop like the one described above ( Figures 2 A and 2B), and (2) a propagating wavefront that allows the state of the cells to be “frozen” at a particular phase of the oscillation. In an expanding biofilm, this “freezing” mechanism might naturally occur during development: replicating cells at the leading edge of biofilm grow, leaving behind daughter cells that become embedded within the biofilm and thus have less nutrient access. Reduced nutrient availability could result in cells “freezing” in the last state of their metabolic activity ( Liu et al., 2015 21. Liu, J. ∙ Prindle, A. ∙ Humphries, J. ... Metabolic co-dependence gives rise to collective oscillations within biofilms Nature. 2015; 523 :550-554 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that these two features can be found in growing biofilms, it may be possible for a clock and wavefront model to account for the observed spatial ring-like pattern that forms during biofilm development.
Using mathematical modeling, we investigated whether the clock and wavefront mechanism described above is sufficient to generate a ring-like spatial pattern in biofilms. We built an agent-based model with individual cells occupying a grid on a 1D radial axis ( Figures 2 C and S2 B). We integrated the ODEs of the glutamine negative feedback loop with a space-dependent metabolic “freeze term.” The overall reaction rate in each cell was factored by this freeze term, which slows the reaction down as the distance from the biofilm edge increases (see STAR Methods for details). The clock therefore runs at full speed in cells at the edge of the biofilm (“clock cells”) and gradually slows down below the wavefront for cells in the interior ( Figure 2 C). We find that in this way the clock and wavefront model can preserve the temporal pulse of the simulated nasA expression and generate a spatial ring-like pattern as the system expands ( Figures 2 D and S2 C). The clock and wavefront mechanism is thus sufficient to explain the formation of the experimentally observed ring-like nitrogen stress response pattern ( Figures 1 E and 1G).
To pursue a stringent test of the clock and wavefront model, we asked whether a developing biofilm can even generate multiple concentric rings. If the negative feedback oscillates in multiple cycles within the time frame of biofilm development (∼48 h), the clock and wavefront mechanism could translate the oscillations into multiple concentric rings, similar to segments in vertebrates. Given that biofilm growth ceases after about 2 days, we investigated whether it would be possible to speed up the metabolic dynamics so that several cycles could fit within this time window ( Figure 3 A). We aimed to decrease the period of oscillations without genetically manipulating the undomesticated biofilms. Specifically, we investigated whether the oscillation period could be sped up by simply changing the concentrations of the nitrogen source (glutamate) or the major carbon source (glycerol) ( Figure 3 B). We modeled a change in glutamate concentration as a change in glutamate supply rate, which in turn changes glutamine synthesis (see STAR Methods for details). We modeled a change in glycerol concentration as a change in 2-oxoglutarate synthesis rate, since 2-oxoglutarate connects carbon to nitrogen metabolism ( Gunka and Commichau, 2012 12. Gunka, K. ∙ Commichau, F.M. Control of glutamate homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis: a complex interplay between ammonium assimilation, glutamate biosynthesis and degradation Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 85 :213-224 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sonenshein, 2007 40. Sonenshein, A.L. Control of key metabolic intersections in Bacillus subtilis Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5 :917-927 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results show that a higher glutamate concentration shortens the period due to a decrease in the effective time-delay of the negative feedback ( Figure S3 A). This emergent effect is similar to traditional results obtained where time delay is considered explicitly ( Lewis, 2003 20. Lewis, J. Autoinhibition with transcriptional delay: a simple mechanism for the zebrafish somitogenesis oscillator Curr Biol. 2003; 13 :1398-1408 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (623) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to the effect of increased glutamate, a higher glycerol concentration does not markedly alter the period but rather contributes to increasing the parameter range over which oscillation occurs ( Figure S3 B). In the 2D parameter space of glycerol and glutamate modulation ( Figure 3 C), we find that proportionally increasing both glutamate and glycerol concentrations ( Figure 3 C, black arrow) leads to oscillations that exhibit the desired shorter period ( Figure 3 D) over a broad range of parameter values ( Figure 3 E). The agent-based model thus predicts the emergence of a double-ring pattern (two concentric rings) in the biofilm under combined higher glutamate and glycerol concentrations ( Figures 3 F and 3G). According to our model, it may be experimentally feasible to obtain multiple rings of gene expression during biofilm development if glutamate and glycerol concentrations are both proportionally increased.
We experimentally tested the important modeling prediction that a double-ring pattern of gene expression can emerge in a developing biofilm. In accordance with our modeling results, we increased by 3-fold the concentration of both glutamate and glycerol in the MSgg growth medium. We indeed find that biofilms grown under these nutrient conditions generate two temporal pulses of nasA expression, resulting in two concentric rings of gene expression ( Figures 3 H–3K; Video S1 ). In fact, we could even detect the onset of a third ring, but the biofilm growth ceased before it become prominent ( Figure S4 ; Video S2 ). Importantly, we again emphasize that these multiple rings were achieved without any genetic or drug-based modifications. These results demonstrate that the nitrogen stress response of biofilms is intrinsically able to generate multiple spatiotemporal oscillations of nasA expression that result in a spatial pattern of concentric rings, thereby strongly supporting our clock and wavefront model.

Left: Time-lapse movie. Right: Time-lapse of maximum projection up to each time point. Scale bar, 1 mm.
To further validate the clock underlying our model, we specifically tested the role of negative feedback loop components ( Figure 4 A). We first made two point mutations in the TnrA binding site of the nasA promoter containing the YFP reporter (P nasA (mut) ; see STAR Methods for details) ( Nakano et al., 1995 28. Nakano, M.M. ∙ Yang, F. ∙ Hardin, P. ... Nitrogen regulation of nasA and the nasB operon, which encode genes required for nitrate assimilation in Bacillus subtilis J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177 :573-579 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, we no longer observed the ring-like gene expression pattern ( Figures S5 A–S5C), confirming that the P nasA - yfp construct reports the activity of TnrA. Next, we asked if TnrA inhibition by glutamine is a critical aspect of the negative feedback loop. To test this, we constructed a point mutation that disrupts the FBI-GS binding site of TnrA ( Wray and Fisher, 2007 52. Wray, Jr., L.V. ∙ Fisher, S.H. Functional analysis of the carboxy-terminal region of Bacillus subtilis TnrA, a MerR family protein J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :20-27 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with modeling simulations ( Figure 4 B), the mutant (TnrA M96A ) biofilm exhibited sustained nasA expression at all time points and across the entire biofilm ( Figure 4 C). This indicates that regulation from FBI-GS is critical in turning off TnrA activity and subsequently nasA expression. To test the importance of the negative feedback via GOGAT, we deleted gltA . We found that in agreement with modeling simulations ( Figure 4 D), the gltA deletion strain disrupted the multiple ring pattern and exhibited low nasA expression over the entire biofilm ( Figure 4 E). This result shows that the GOGAT-mediated negative feedback loop is crucial for oscillations. Consistent with this mechanism, spatial expression of gltA in the biofilm is anti-correlated with nasA expression in the P gltA - yfp , P nasA - cfp dual-reporter strain ( Figures S5 D–S5G). This anti-correlated expression of nasA and gltA not only further supports our model but also clearly demonstrates that the observed complex spatial gene expression patterns are actively generated by the nitrogen stress response circuit. Together, these results confirm the critical role of the negative feedback loop structure and its components in the generation of the non-trivial, ring-like nasA expression pattern.
We next set out to identify and characterize experimentally the wavefront component of the system. According to the model, the wavefront propagates outward as the biofilm grows, freezing the clock at specific phases of the oscillation and thereby generating the stationary ring pattern ( Figure 2 C). In our mathematical model, we define the wavefront as the boundary at which the metabolic activity (given by the “freeze term” described in the STAR Methods ) has decayed to 50% of its maximum level ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Simulations show that nasA oscillations should occur only ahead of the wavefront, but not behind it ( Figure 4 H). To test this prediction experimentally, we first identified the wavefront by using changes in the expression of the transcriptional reporter P hyperspank - cfp ( Figures 4 I, S5 H and S5I) as a proxy for metabolic activity. We defined the wavefront as the boundary where the CFP signal difference between consecutive time points is at 50% of its maximum (which is the same threshold used in our simulations). We then averaged the P nasA -yfp signal difference separately for the regions ahead of and behind this wavefront ( Figure 4 J). In agreement with the model, nasA activity shows clear oscillations ahead of the wavefront, but not behind it. Together, these data show that, consistent with the clock and wavefront model, nitrogen stress oscillations become “frozen” into a spatial pattern as the wavefront crosses cells.
Next, we investigated whether the observed concentric ring pattern is generated by a cell-autonomous process, as predicted by our model. A fundamental property of the clock and wavefront mechanism is that cell-autonomous oscillations generate the spatial patterns without the requirement of long-range diffusion of signaling molecules. This property distinguishes the clock and wavefront mechanism from others, such as reaction-diffusion systems, which can also generate spatial patterns but require the diffusion of instructive signals ( Basu et al., 2005 4.

To determine if long-range diffusion plays a key role in the observed concentric ring patterns, we inserted a diffusional barrier during biofilm development ( Figure 5 A). Specifically, after the biofilm generated its first ring of nasA expression, we inserted a physical barrier (plastic separator) between the ring and the biofilm periphery (first two panels in Figure 5 B). This barrier penetrated all the way through the depth of the agar and blocked the diffusion of chemicals between the separated regions of the biofilm ( Figure S6 ). After the insertion of the physical barrier, the biofilms continued to grow at the periphery and formed the expected second ring of nasA expression without spatial distortion ( Figure 5 B). This finding argues against mechanisms mediated by the long-range diffusion of signals and suggests that the observed concentric-ring patterns are driven by cell-autonomous oscillations.
To more directly test whether individual cells indeed exhibit oscillations as predicted by the clock and wavefront model ( Figure 5 C), we tracked the nitrogen stress dynamics of individual cells ( Figure 5 D). Since tracking of individual cells within a large biofilm is experimentally challenging, we opted for measuring the P nasA reporter dynamics in microcolonies composed of hundreds of bacteria. To mimic the nitrogen limitation within the biofilm, we used media with a 500-fold lower nitrogen (glutamate) concentration compared to the medium used for biofilm growth on agar. As predicted by our clock and wavefront model, we indeed observed oscillations of the nasA promoter expression in single cells ( Figures 5 D and 5E). The period of nasA oscillations in single cells was similar to the period observed in biofilms with concentric rings (approximately 15 h; Figures 3 H and 5 E). The observed nitrogen stress response dynamics in biofilms thus appear to result from single-cell-level oscillations, consistent with one of the key features of the clock and wavefront mechanism.
Nitrogen stress is known to trigger sporulation in B. subtilis ( Dawes and Mandelstam, 1970 10. Dawes, I.W. ∙ Mandelstam, J. Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis in continuous culture J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103 :529-535 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Schaeffer et al., 1965 37. Schaeffer, P. ∙ Millet, J. ∙ Aubert, J.P. Catabolic repression of bacterial sporulation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1965; 54 :704-711 Crossref Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested the expectation that peaks in nasA expression may precede sporulation. Imaging of microcolonies revealed that sporulation was visible by phase contrast optics ( Figure 5 D). To precisely examine the relationship between the nitrogen stress response and sporulation, we constructed a dual-reporter strain (P nasA - cfp , P spoIIR - yfp ). This strain allowed us to simultaneously monitor the nitrogen stress response as well as the irreversible commitment to sporulation, as reported by spoIIR expression ( Karow et al., 1995 17. Karow, M.L. ∙ Glaser, P. ∙ Piggot, P.J. Identification of a gene, spoIIR, that links the activation of sigma E to the transcriptional activity of sigma F during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92 :2012-2016 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuchina et al., 2011 18. Kuchina, A. ∙ Espinar, L. ∙ Garcia-Ojalvo, J. ... Reversible and noisy progression towards a commitment point enables adaptable and reliable cellular decision-making PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7 :e1002273 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Londoño-Vallejo and Stragier, 1995 22. Londoño-Vallejo, J.A. ∙ Stragier, P. Cell-cell signaling pathway activating a developmental transcription factor in Bacillus subtilis Genes Dev. 1995; 9 :503-508 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). By simultaneously tracking the activities of these two promoters at the single-cell level in microcolonies, we found that sporulation follows the peaks in nitrogen stress oscillations with a time delay of approximately 5 h (5.6 ± 3.5 SD) ( Figures 6 A–6C). Specifically, after each peak of nasA expression, cells expressed spoIIR , and a subset of them sporulated, while the rest continued to oscillate in nasA expression. Cells that did not sporulate after the first pulse of nasA expression were observed to sporulate at subsequent nasA pulses ( Figures 6 B–6D). These results confirm that sporulation is promoted by nitrogen stress and, more importantly, suggest that oscillation in the nitrogen stress response could spatially pattern sporulation in biofilms.
Based on our single-cell measurements, we hypothesized that sporulation follows the ring pattern of nitrogen stress in the biofilm. In other words, we expected to see a spatial correlation between the concentric rings of nasA expression and the regions of higher sporulation. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dual-reporter strain described above (P nasA - cfp , P spoIIR - yfp ) in biofilms ( Figures 6 E and 6F). As expected, we found that sporulation occurs in a ring-like pattern similar to the nitrogen stress response pattern. The maximum intensities measured over time show that the spatial patterns of spoIIR expression in concentric rings follow those of nasA expression in the biofilm ( Figures 6 G–6I). Furthermore, the sporulation “segments” appeared with a time delay relative to the nitrogen stress response. This time delay in biofilms was on the same order of magnitude as was observed with single-cell measurements ( Figures 6 A–6C and 6E–6F). Due to this time delay, the nasA and spoIIR rings do not perfectly overlap in space ( Figure 6 I). The spatiotemporal concurrence of the nitrogen stress response and sporulation ( Figure 6 J) suggests that spore formation within the biofilm is patterned by the clock and wavefront mechanism.

Section: Discussion

Our results show that the nitrogen stress response within a B. subtilis biofilm can inherently form a complex pattern of concentric rings. More specifically, as the biofilm expands by cell replication, temporal oscillation in the nitrogen stress response appears to be imprinted into spatial concentric rings through a clock and wavefront mechanism. We further show that the temporal oscillations in the nitrogen stress response are cell-autonomous and influence sporulation dynamics. Consequently, the observed concentric ring pattern is converted into a “fossil record” by sporulation. Single-cell measurements in microcolonies also capture the corresponding global dynamics observed in large biofilms. A growing community of oscillating bacteria can thus generate spores in a spatially and temporally organized manner. In other words, the biofilm appears to utilize the oscillating nature of the nitrogen stress response as a means to pattern sporulation within a multicellular community.
Various patterning mechanisms have been identified in biological systems, provoking the question of whether the clock and wavefront mechanism may provide some benefit for biofilms. First, biofilms consist of individual cells that are embedded in a dense extracellular matrix ( Billings et al., 2015 6. Billings, N. ∙ Birjiniuk, A. ∙ Samad, T.S. ... Material properties of biofilms-a review of methods for understanding permeability and mechanics Rep. Prog. Phys. 2015; 78 :036601 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vlamakis et al., 2013 48. Vlamakis, H. ∙ Chai, Y. ∙ Beauregard, P. ... Sticking together: building a biofilm the Bacillus subtilis way Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11 :157-168 Crossref Scopus (721) PubMed Google Scholar ). This organization may lead to physical barriers that make it difficult to drive biofilm-level coordination through the long-range diffusion of signals. Therefore, mechanisms that rely, for example, on diffusion-based morphogen gradients as described in Drosophila embryos ( St Johnston and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1992 43. St Johnston, D. ∙ Nüsslein-Volhard, C. The origin of pattern and polarity in the Drosophila embryo Cell. 1992; 68 :201-219 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1165) PubMed Google Scholar ) may not be ideal for the patterning of biofilms. Second, the biofilm is a growing and spatially expanding system similar to vertebrate embryos. If a pattern were formed through a diffusion-based mechanism, it would migrate as the system expands, and individual cells would receive inconsistent differentiation signals. In contrast, the clock and wavefront mechanism is based on a cell-autonomous clock driven by a genetic circuit that is likely more robust to changes in system size. The cellular independence of the clock and wavefront mechanism suggests a more reliable patterning of the biofilm.
While bacteria are notorious for utilizing stochastic cell-to-cell variability as a bet-hedging strategy ( Balaban et al., 2004 3. Balaban, N.Q. ∙ Merrin, J. ∙ Chait, R. ...

An excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation Nature. 2006; 440 :545-550 Crossref Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ; Veening et al., 2008 47. Veening, J.W. ∙ Smits, W.K. ∙ Kuipers, O.P. Bistability, epigenetics, and bet-hedging in bacteria Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62 :193-210 Crossref Scopus (772) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results indicate that the development of bacterial biofilm communities is governed by a deterministic clock and wavefront process. In particular, biofilms appear to utilize an oscillatory process that can locally amplify nitrogen stress responses, such that spores may form even under a more abundant nutrient supply closer to the biofilm edge. In this way, spores are not restricted to form only in the starved interior of the biofilm. The ring-like patterning mechanism described here allows the biofilm to form spores at different times and in distinct locations (segments) of the biofilm without being strictly tied to nutrient availability. It is plausible to speculate that such spatiotemporal cell-type patterning may be beneficial to cope with unpredictable changes in future conditions, as not all spores are formed at the same time and the same region of the biofilm. The biofilm may thus employ a bet-hedging strategy typically associated with stochastic unicellular organisms but by using the deterministic patterning mechanism of multicellular organisms. Our work thus indicates a paradigm for a bacterial system that blends unicellular and multicellular strategies for cellular differentiation.
We show here that the clock and wavefront mechanism established for vertebrate somitogenesis is surprisingly applicable to biofilm development. In both cases, the clock and wavefront mechanism generates patterns by “freezing” the different phases of an oscillation in the form of spatially repeating segments. Furthermore, we find that the pattern generated by the nitrogen stress response in turn defines spatial regions within the biofilm where cells differentiate into spores. Cellular differentiation within the biofilm thus becomes “segmented” similar to somitogenesis in developing embryos. We thus present a bacterial paradigm for developmental patterning with fewer biological complexities and experimental limitations compared with the study of vertebrate embryos. While there are undoubtably marked differences, our findings provoke a reconsideration of the commonly assumed divide between “simple” unicellular organisms and “complex” multicellular organisms such as vertebrates.
While our work identifies an intriguing similarity between patterning of cellular differentiation during bacterial biofilm development and mammalian somitogenesis, we would like to point out that this similarity is at the conceptual level and, of course, detailed molecular mechanisms are distinct. Furthermore, recent literature on vertebrate systems has proposed alternatives to the clock and wavefront mechanism ( Lauschke et al., 2013 19. Lauschke, V.M. ∙ Tsiairis, C.D. ∙ François, P. ... Scaling of embryonic patterning based on phase-gradient encoding Nature. 2013; 493 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ; Murray et al., 2011 26.

Dynamics of the slowing segmentation clock reveal alternating two-segment periodicity Development. 2015; 142 :1785-1793 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Soroldoni et al., 2014 41. Soroldoni, D. ∙ Jörg, D.J. ∙ Morelli, L.G. ... Genetic oscillations. A Doppler effect in embryonic pattern formation Science. 2014; 345 :222-225 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). Distinguishing between some of these mechanisms in a B. subtilis biofilm can be challenging due to the fundamental differences in detailed molecular mechanisms and components. For instance, B. subtilis biofilms do not exhibit a clear-cut boundary between cell types equivalent to the sharp transition between presomitic mesoderm and somites in vertebrates. We thus cannot conclusively determine whether alternatives to the clock and wavefront mechanism, such as those based on an oscillator phase-gradient ( Lauschke et al., 2013 19. Lauschke, V.M. ∙ Tsiairis, C.D. ∙ François, P. ... Scaling of embryonic patterning based on phase-gradient encoding Nature. 2013; 493 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ), could play a role in biofilm segmentation. In addition, here we use B. subtilis biofilms grown on agar pads, which allows us to experimentally study large biofilms (>1 cm across), but this in turn limits our access to single-cell resolution measurements in these large communities. We were therefore unable to directly track in such large biofilms the decline of oscillation in single cells as the wavefront passes or determine whether autonomous oscillations in adjacent cells may become coupled. Future studies are required to elucidate such questions. In spite of these limitations, our findings are likely to inspire new studies to better understand not only the differences but more importantly the intriguing commonalities of segmentation patterning among evolutionary distant developmental systems.

The Bacillus subtilis strains used in this study, as well as vectors and primers used to generate the strains, are listed in Key resources table . Briefly, four kinds of chromosomal integration vectors are used to construct strains: (1) pSac-cm (ECE174: Bacillus Genetic Stock Center) is used for sacA locus integration, (2) pDL30 (kind gift from Jonathan Dworkin, Columbia University) is used for amyE locus integration, (3) pER449 vector is a generic integration vector used to introduce a mutation in the coding region of tnrA gene to generate TnrA M96A strain, and (4) ECE173 is used to generate the gltA deletion mutant. ECE174-P nasA -yf p and pDL30-P nasA -cfp vectors are kind gifts from the Michael Elowitz lab (Caltech, CA). P nasA (mut) - yfp construct was generated based on P nasA - yfp using primers GS1871 and GS1872. It contains two point mutations in the well-characterized TnrA binding sequence (T G TC A CAAAAACTTACA → T A TC G CAAAAACTTACA). These mutations were characterized in Nakano et al. (1995) 28.

Biofilms were grown on MSgg plates: MSgg medium [5 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 100 mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.0, adjusted with NaOH), 2 mM MgCl 2 , 700 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM MnCl 2 , 100 mM FeCl 3 , 1 mM ZnCl 2 , 2 mM thiamine HCl, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) monosodium glutamate] supplemented with 1.5% agar (w/v). Glutamate and iron stocks were made fresh for each experiment. MSgg medium was made fresh from stocks the day of the experiment. 3xMSgg medium used to create multiple concentric rings was the same as regular MSgg medium except three times the normal amount of glycerol and three times the normal amount of glutamate. MSgg medium used in single cell experiments (scMSgg) used 1.5% (w/v) glycerol and 0.003% (w/v) glutamate, which has 500 times less glutamate than the biofilm condition to mimic the nitrogen limitation within the biofilm. The P hyperspank reporter was induced using 1 mM IPTG.
The day before the experiment, MSgg or 3xMSgg plate was poured to a height of 2.5 mm and left to set for 5-10 minutes. The plate was then left upside-down at 30°C overnight. Desired strains were streaked out from −80°C glycerol stocks onto separate LB plates with appropriate selection antibiotics. The following day, a single colony was picked from the plate and inoculated into 2 mL of LB broth. After 4.5 hr of shaking growth at 37°C, the optical density (OD) was measured and normalized such that all strains had the same OD of 1.3 in 1.5 mL total volume. Cells were then spun down at 2100 r cf. for 1.5 min and resuspended in 1.5 mL MSgg. They were then grown at 37°C with shaking for 1.5 hr for cells to acclimate to the MSgg media. Then, 1 μL of cell culture was spotted into the middle of each well of the 12-well plate and imaged.
The day before the experiment, 15 mL scMSgg media supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) agar was poured into a Petri dish of diameter 10 mm. After solidifying, the plate was then left upside-down at 30°C overnight. Desired strains were streaked out from −80°C glycerol stocks onto LB plates with appropriate selection antibiotics. The following day, a single colony was picked from the plate and inoculated into 2 mL of LB broth. After 2.5 hr of shaking at 37°C, the optical density (OD) was measured. Cells were then normalized such that all strains had a final OD of 1.3 in 1 mL total volume and spun down at 2100 r cf. for 1 min. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL MSgg and spun down again at 2100 r cf. for 1 min. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL MSgg and grown with shaking at 37°C for 1.5 hr to acclimate to the MSgg media. During this time, 1 cm by 1 cm pads were cut out from the plate made the day before. Then, 2 μL of cell culture was spotted into the middle of each pad, each pad flipped upside-down onto a glass-bottom dish, and imaged.
Biofilm dynamics were observed via time-lapse microscopy using an Olympus IX81 microscope with a Lambda XL light source from Sutter Instruments and a 2.5x objective. Images were taken with an ORCA-Flash4.0 V2 camera (Hamamatsu) at 40-minute intervals. Single cell dynamics were observed via time-lapse microscopy using an Olympus IX83 microscope with an X-Cite LED light source from Lumen Dynamics and a 100x objective. Images were taken at 20-minute intervals.
Our clock and wavefront model considers a molecular clock that oscillates in each individual cell in an expanding biofilm. We used nine ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the mass-action reactions between each component i of glutamine metabolism that drives and modulates the molecular clock ( Figures S2 A and 2 A). 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐸 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝐸 − 𝛼 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐸 + 𝛽 𝑄 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑂 ⁢ 𝑄 − 𝛼 𝑄 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑁 − 𝛾 𝐸 ⁢ 𝐸 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐸 − 𝛼 𝑄 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑂 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑂 + 𝛼 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐸 − 𝛽 𝑄 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑂 ⁢ 𝑄 − 𝛾 𝑂 ⁢ 𝑂 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑆 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑆 − 𝛽 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑆 − 𝛼 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑄 𝑚 𝐾 𝑚 𝐹 + 𝑄 𝑚 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑄 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑄 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑁 − 𝛽 𝑄 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑂 ⁢ 𝑄 − 𝛾 𝑄 ⁢ 𝑄 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐹 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑄 𝑚 𝐾 𝑚 𝐹 + 𝑄 𝑚 − 𝛽 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐹 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑇 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑇 ⁢ ( 𝑇 𝑇 − 𝑇 ) − 𝛽 𝑇 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑇 𝑑 ⁢ 𝐴 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐾 𝑛 𝑇 𝐾 𝑛 𝑇 + 𝑇 𝑛 − 𝛽 𝐴 ⁢ 𝐴 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑅 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑇 𝑛 𝐾 𝑛 𝑅 + 𝑇 𝑛 − 𝛽 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑅 − 𝛾 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑅 The cycle between glutamate ( E ) and glutamine ( Q ) lies at the intersection between nitrogen and carbon metabolism. Glutamate is provided externally from the media as the only nitrogen source to the system. GS (glutamine synthetase, S ) catalyzes the conversion of glutamate and ammonium ( N ) to form glutamine ( Q ). We assume that ammonium is exclusively provided by the degradation of glutamate at a constant rate. GOGAT (glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase, A ) in turn converts glutamine into glutamate by transferring an amino group to 2-oxoglutarate ( O ). 2-oxoglutarate is provided externally from glycerol through the TCA cycle or from degradation of glutamate. The GS-GOGAT enzymatic reactions are modeled by mass-action kinetics assuming that substrate concentrations are below the capacity of the enzymes.
The negative feedback loop that regulates glutamine ( Q ) via FBI-GS ( F ), TnrA ( T ), and GOGAT ( A ) underlies the core oscillator ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). A minor portion of glutamine (neglected in the glutamine equation) and its downstream nitrogen-containing metabolites bind to GS to form FBI-GS (feedback-inhibited GS, F ). The cumulative nature of GS inhibition was modeled with a Hill function. FBI-GS binds and sequesters the transcription factor TnrA, which we model as a simple binding-unbinding process with the total amount of TnrA assumed constant. Free TnrA ( T ) indirectly inhibits GOGAT and enhances the production of the fluorescent reporter P nasA - yfp ( R ), both of which we also model with Hill functions. In addition to protein degradation, we also assume minor photobleaching of the fluorescent reporter R .
We integrate the metabolic reactions into individual cells in an expanding biofilm. The expansion of the biofilm is modeled as an array of single cells in one spatial dimension along the radial axis ( r ) of the biofilm ( Figures S2 B–S2C). We modeled the expansion in a simplified scenario by assuming duplication at only periphery-most cell, while the rest of the cells remains in place ( Figures S2 B–S2C). As the cell at the periphery continues to duplicate, cells that were born earlier become positioned at the interior of the biofilm with increasing distances from the periphery of the biofilm. To account for the decrease in nutrient availability with increasing distance to the periphery, we define a metabolic freeze term g(r,t) as: 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) = 𝜀 1 + 𝜂 ⋅ ( 𝑟 0 + 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑡 − 𝑟 ) where r is the position of a given cell, ε is a factor that scales the metabolic rates to match the two-dimensional growth of biofilms in experimental data, r 0 marks the edge of the area where the initial cell culture was plated to grow a biofilm, k denotes the expansion rate of the biofilm, and η is a multiplicative factor that relates the distance (and thus the nutrient availability) to the decrease in metabolic activity. We consider that this freeze term acts multiplicatively on all reaction terms of the differential equations given above, except on the photobleaching of the fluorescent reporter R.
The differential equations given above are solved by MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.) solver ode45. Cell duplication was treated as a discrete process.

For each biofilm movie, Radial Profile Extended plugin from FIJI (ImageJ) was used to determine intensity along the biofilm radius. A circle was manually fitted against the initial droplet of cells using the brightfield image of the first time point. This circle was used to find the coordinates of the center point of the biofilm. The plugin finds the mean intensities along the radial profile for each image in the time series. These mean intensities were normalized by the minimal and maximal intensities across all time points. For each time point plot, one line represents one biofilm. Maximum projection graphs were derived from data outputted from the radial profile plugin. The maximum intensity value across all points along the radius was found using custom Python code. This was repeated for all fluorescence channels and plotted using Matplotlib (Python). Average values and the 95% confidence interval were determined in Python.
The position of the wavefront was determined using P hyperspank -cfp “ difference movies.” To obtain a difference movie, each frame was obtained by subtracting the pixel intensities of the previous time point from the current one. We then obtained and smoothed the radial difference profile and define the position of the wavefront using 50% of the maximum difference value. The wavefront speed was then measured using displacement of the wavefront position divided by time. The time between nasA rings is determined by local maxima of P nasA -yfp time trace. The distance between nasA rings is determined using the maximum projection image.
Custom MATLAB (MathWorks) software was written to track single cells over time. Phase contrast images were used to define an ROI for each cell for each image frame. The generated ROIs were then used to determine intensity in the fluorescence channels. A total of 67 cells from five independent experiments were tracked. Intensities were normalized within the same experimental set. The traces from different movie sets were then aligned at the time point where the normalized P nasA - yfp fluorescence intensity was 0.2, which is considered above the background signal. Average values and the 95% confidence interval were calculated via Python.
