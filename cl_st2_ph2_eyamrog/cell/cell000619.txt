Title: Structure, receptor recognition, and antigenicity of the human coronavirus CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike glycoprotein


Abstract: Summary

The isolation of CCoV-HuPn-2018 from a child respiratory swab indicates that more coronaviruses are spilling over to humans than previously appreciated. We determined the structures of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike glycoprotein trimer in two distinct conformational states and showed that its domain 0 recognizes sialosides. We identified that the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike binds canine, feline, and porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) orthologs, which serve as entry receptors, and determined the structure of the receptor-binding B domain in complex with canine APN. The introduction of an oligosaccharide at position N739 of human APN renders cells susceptible to CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike-mediated entry, suggesting that single-nucleotide polymorphisms might account for viral detection in some individuals. Human polyclonal plasma antibodies elicited by HCoV-229E infection and a porcine coronavirus monoclonal antibody inhibit CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike-mediated entry, underscoring the cross-neutralizing activity among ɑ-coronaviruses. These data pave the way for vaccine and therapeutic development targeting this zoonotic pathogen representing the eighth human-infecting coronavirus.

Section: Introduction

Four coronaviruses are endemic in humans and typically responsible for common colds: the β-coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 and the ɑ-coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. Moreover, three highly pathogenic β-coronaviruses have jumped from their animal hosts to humans in the last two decades: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Recurrent coronavirus zoonoses along with detection of numerous coronaviruses in wildlife suggest that cross-species transmission events will continue to occur ( Anthony et al., 2017 2.

The coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein folds as a homotrimer promoting viral entry into host cells ( Tortorici and Veesler, 2019 85. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Veesler, D.

S comprises an S 1 subunit, which recognizes host cell receptors, and an S 2 subunit, that mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes ( Walls et al., 2017 96.

USA. 2017; 114 :11157-11162 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, S plays a key role in modulating host and tissue tropism as well as zoonotic transmission. Since the coronavirus S glycoprotein is the target of neutralizing antibodies, it is the main focus of therapeutics and vaccine development, including monoclonal antibody therapies.

Viruses genetically related to canine and feline coronaviruses have been previously identified in respiratory swabs obtained from patients with pneumonia or acute respiratory symptoms in Malaysia and the US ( Silva and Mullis, 2014 78. Silva, C.S. ∙ Mullis, L.B. Human respiratory coronaviruses detected in patients with InfluenzaLike illness in Arkansas, USA Virol. Mycol. 2014; 01 :004 Crossref Google Scholar ; Xiu et al., 2020 105.

In Malaysia, eight out of 301 (2.5%) patients hospitalized with pneumonia between 2017 and 2018 in Sarawak were positive by pan-species coronavirus semi-nested RT-PCR assay, and one specimen was identified as a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus (genotype II) that was named CCoV-HuPn-2018 ( Vlasova et al., 2021 90. Vlasova, A.N. ∙ Diaz, A. ∙ Damtie, D. ... Novel canine coronavirus isolated from a hospitalized pneumonia patient, East Malaysia Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; 74 :446-454 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ). The coronavirus isolate was shown to be cytopathic using canine A72 cells ( Vlasova et al., 2021 90. Vlasova, A.N. ∙ Diaz, A. ∙ Damtie, D. ... Novel canine coronavirus isolated from a hospitalized pneumonia patient, East Malaysia Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; 74 :446-454 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ). A closely related virus (HuCCoV_Z19Haiti) harboring a S glycoprotein differing by only two amino acids was subsequently identified in Florida from urine samples of travelers coming back from Haiti ( Lednicky et al., 2021a 36. Lednicky, J.A. ∙ Tagliamonte, M.S. ∙ White, S.K. ... Isolation of a novel recombinant canine coronavirus from a visitor to Haiti: further evidence of transmission of coronaviruses of zoonotic origin to humans Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar ). These studies suggested that zoonotic transmission occurred and that these viruses, which were not previously known to infect humans, might be associated with clinical symptoms. Furthermore, these findings point to the circulation of several more coronaviruses in humans than previously appreciated and underscore the zoonotic threats posed by members of multiple distinct coronavirus genera.

Section: Results

To visualize the infection machinery of the newly emerged CCoV-HuPn-2018, we characterized its S glycoprotein ectodomain trimer using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). The CCoV-HuPn-2018 S trimer is ∼150Å high with a triangular cross-section and comprises an N-terminal S 1 subunit divided into domains designated 0 and A-D as well as a C-terminal S 2 subunit, which contains the fusion machinery ( Tortorici and Veesler, 2019 85. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Veesler, D. Structural insights into coronavirus entry Adv. Virus Res. 2019; 105 :93-116 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). 3D classification of the data revealed the presence of two distinct S conformations with domain 0 swung out (at the periphery of the trimer) or proximal, i.e., oriented toward the viral membrane (apposed directly underneath domain A) for which we determined structures at 2.8- and 3.1-Å resolution, respectively ( Figures 1 B–1G and S1 ; Table S1 ). The latter domain 0 conformational state (“proximal”) is similar to the one described for the S of HCoV-NL63 ( Walls et al., 2016b 95. Walls, A.C. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Frenz, B. ... Glycan shield and epitope masking of a coronavirus spike protein observed by cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 :899-905 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) ( Kirchdoerfer et al., 2021 34. Kirchdoerfer, R.N. ∙ Bhandari, M. ∙ Martini, O. ... Structure and immune recognition of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein Structure. 2021; 29 :385-392.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the former conformation (“swung out”) is more reminiscent of another state detected for PEDV S ( Wrapp and McLellan, 2019 101. Wrapp, D. ∙ McLellan, J.S. The 3.1-angstrom cryo-electron microscopy structure of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein in the prefusion conformation J. Virol. 2019; 93 e00923–e00919 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) ( Figure S2 ). We used local refinement to overcome the conformational variability of domain 0 and obtained reconstructions at 3.1- and 3.8-Å resolution for the swung-out and proximal conformational states, respectively, which are related by a rotation of 135° ( Figures 1 H and S1 ; Table S1 ).
The CCoV-HuPn-2018 S trimer is densely decorated with oligosaccharides distributed in both the S 1 and S 2 subunits. In total, 22 glycans out of 32 putative N-linked glycosylation sequons in CCoV-HuPn-2018 S ectodomain are resolved to different extents in at least one of the two cryo-EM maps ( Figures 1 B–1E; Table S2 ). The S 1 subunit structure is most similar to HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E S whereas the S 2 subunit architecture is most closely related to PEDV and FIPV S, supporting the possibility that the CCoV-HuPn-2018 S gene arose from a recombination event ( Vlasova et al., 2021 90. Vlasova, A.N. ∙ Diaz, A. ∙ Damtie, D. ... Novel canine coronavirus isolated from a hospitalized pneumonia patient, East Malaysia Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; 74 :446-454 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ). Although the B domains remain in a closed state, i.e., sitting atop the fusion machinery, in both CCoV-HuPn-2018 S conformations, the two structures differ in the tertiary and quaternary organization of the S 1 subunit crown. Specifically, domain A moves radially outward upon transition from a proximal to a swung-out domain 0 conformation, positioning it >6 Å further away from the B domain belonging to the same protomer ( Figures 1 F–1H). As a result, domain A moves closer to and forms tight interactions with the C domain of a neighboring protomer in the swung-out domain 0 state. Overall, interactions among C domains contribute to a marked enhancement of the total surface area buried between S 1 protomers (stabilizing the S 1 trimer), whereas the B domains reduce tertiary and quaternary contacts with their surroundings upon transition to the swung-out conformation, likely enabling subsequent opening and receptor engagement.
The CCoV-HuPn-2018 S lacks a polybasic furin cleavage site at the S 1 /S 2 junction, similar to type-II feline and canine coronaviruses ( Licitra et al., 2013 42. Licitra, B.N. ∙ Millet, J.K. ∙ Regan, A.D. ... Mutation in spike protein cleavage site and pathogenesis of feline coronavirus Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2013; 19 :1066-1073 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Millet and Whittaker, 2015 59. Millet, J.K. ∙ Whittaker, G.R. Host cell proteases: critical determinants of coronavirus tropism and pathogenesis Virus Res. 2015; 202 :120-134 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we did not detect proteolytic processing of CCoV-HuPn-2018 S in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles pseudotypes produced in HEK293T cells, similar to HCoV-229E S VSV ( Figure 1 G). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 S or MERS-CoV S VSV pseudotypes were cleaved at S 1 /S 2 by furin-like proteases ( Figure 1 G; Millet and Whittaker, 2014 58. Millet, J.K. ∙ Whittaker, G.R. Host cell entry of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus after two-step, furin-mediated activation of the spike protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4598) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CCoV-HuPn-2018 S 2 ′ site contains a polybasic motif K 953 RKYR 957 , which is identical to the one found in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) S and some type II feline and canine coronavirus S sequences ( Millet and Whittaker, 2015 59. Millet, J.K. ∙ Whittaker, G.R. Host cell proteases: critical determinants of coronavirus tropism and pathogenesis Virus Res. 2015; 202 :120-134 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ) and might modulate cleavage and infectivity.
Coronaviruses can use multiple domains within the S 1 subunit for receptor attachment and some coronavirus spike glycoproteins engage more than one receptor type to enter host cells ( Hulswit et al., 2019 30.

CCoV-HuPn-2018 domain A folds as a galectin-like β-sandwich and most closely resembles the equivalent domains of ɑ-coronavirus S glycoproteins including HCoV-NL63 ( Walls et al., 2016b 95. Walls, A.C. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Frenz, B. ... Glycan shield and epitope masking of a coronavirus spike protein observed by cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cryo-EM structure of spike protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus strain UU4 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 117 :1438-1446 PubMed Google Scholar ) with which it shares ∼40% sequence identity. Superimposition of the CoV-HuPn-2018 S 0 and A domains underscores their conserved architecture and topology (RMSD 4.2 Å over 139 aligned Cα positions) although they share only 12.5% sequence identity ( Figures 2 A–2G). These findings suggest that both domains derived from an ancestral gene duplication event, as previously described for HCoV-NL63 ( Walls et al., 2016b 95. Walls, A.C. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Frenz, B. ... Glycan shield and epitope masking of a coronavirus spike protein observed by cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 :899-905 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ), and accumulated extensive mutations leading to their very low sequence relatedness.
The CCoV-HuPn-2018 domain B structure is strikingly similar to the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and TGEV domain B structures ( Reguera et al., 2012 74. Reguera, J. ∙ Santiago, C. ∙ Mudgal, G. ... Structural bases of coronavirus attachment to host aminopeptidase N and its inhibition by neutralizing antibodies PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002859 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) with which it shares ∼90% sequence identity, including key aminopeptidase N (APN) interacting residues (PRCV Y320/W363, based on sequence code P27655.1, corresponding to CCoV-HuPn-2018 Y543/W586) ( Figures S3 A–S3C). Although the β-sandwich fold is also shared with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and porcine delta-coronavirus, their receptor-binding loops adopt distinct conformations compared with CCoV-HuPn-2018, PRCV, and TGEV ( Reguera et al., 2012 74.

Although some β-coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, use both proteinaceous and sialoglycan receptors to enter target cells ( Li et al., 2017 40. Li, W. ∙ Hulswit, R.J.G. ∙ Widjaja, I. ...

USA. 1988; 85 :4526-4529 Crossref Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate whether CCoV-HuPn-2018 S could recognize sialoglycans, we evaluated the ability of individual S domains to hemagglutinate erythrocytes. Since interactions with carbohydrate receptors are typically of low affinity, we multivalently displayed CCoV-HuPn-2018 S domain 0, A, or B at the surface of the two-component protein nanoparticle (NP) I53-50 ( Bale et al., 2016 5. Bale, J.B. ∙ Gonen, S. ∙ Liu, Y. ...

HCoV-HKU1 S I53-50 NP and influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-ferritin NP (H1N1 A/New Caledonia/99) were used as positive controls ( Figure 3 A). NPs displaying CCoV-HuPn-2018 S domain 0, but not the A or B domains, hemagglutinated turkey, canine, and human erythrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figures 3 A and 3B). No hemagglutination was observed, however, when human erythrocytes were desialylated by pretreatment with neuraminidase, similar to observations made for MERS-CoV domain A ( Li et al., 2017 40.

USA. 2017; 114 :E8508-E8517 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 C). These results indicate that the CCoV-HuPn-2018 S domain 0 is responsible for the observed hemagglutination of erythrocytes, which is sialic-acid-dependent and likely associated with the attachment process during cell entry.
Based on the structural similarity between the B domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 and other ɑ-coronaviruses such as PRCV and TGEV ( Figures S3 A–S3C), we evaluated the ability of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain to interact with several APN orthologs, which is the proteinaceous receptor for both PRCV and TGEV ( Delmas et al., 1992 19. Delmas, B. ∙ Gelfi, J. ∙ L’Haridon, R. ... Aminopeptidase N is a major receptor for the enteropathogenic coronavirus TGEV Nature. 1992; 357 :417-420 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dimeric feline, canine, and porcine APNs, but not human APN, recognized the biotinylated CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain immobilized at the surface of biolayer interferometry biosensors ( Figures 4 A–4D). The CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain bound with higher avidity to canine APN (K D,app = 1.0 nM) compared with feline APN (K D,app = 27 nM) and porcine APN (K D,app = 41 nM), as was the case for the TGEV B domain ( Figures 4 A–4D and 4F–4I; Table S3 ). We also evaluated the ability of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain to interact with several APN orthologs by pull-down assays and found that feline, canine, and porcine APNs, but not human APN, recognized biotinylated CCoV-HuPn-2018 and TGEV B domains coupled to streptavidin beads ( Figures S5 A, S5B, S5D, and S5E). Human APN, however, interacted with the HCoV-229E B domain as observed by pull-down and biolayer interferometry ( Figures S5 C–S5E, S5G, and S5H; Table 3). These data suggest that CCoV-HuPn-2018 can use several APN orthologs as receptors likely involving a binding mode comparable to PRCV/TGEV but distinct from HCoV-229E ( Reguera et al., 2012 74. Reguera, J. ∙ Santiago, C. ∙ Mudgal, G. ... Structural bases of coronavirus attachment to host aminopeptidase N and its inhibition by neutralizing antibodies PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002859 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wong et al., 2017 100. Wong, A.H.M. ∙ Tomlinson, A.C.A. ∙ Zhou, D. ... Receptor-binding loops in Alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1735 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We determined a crystal structure of the complex between the CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain and canine APN at 3.2 Å resolution to visualize the molecular basis of recognition ( Table S4 ; Figures 4 K–4M). Canine APN forms a crystallographic dimer and binds to CCoV-HuPn-2018 B through interactions reminiscent of those observed for PRCV B in complex with porcine APN ( Figure 4 M; Reguera et al., 2012 74. Reguera, J. ∙ Santiago, C. ∙ Mudgal, G. ... Structural bases of coronavirus attachment to host aminopeptidase N and its inhibition by neutralizing antibodies PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002859 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CCoV-HuPn-2018 domain B Y543 side chain, which protrudes from receptor-binding loop 1, packs against the core fucose linked to canine APN N747 (human APN position 739) ( Figure 4 M) and is hydrogen bonded to APN E742 (human APN position 734) and W748 side chains (human APN position 740) ( Figure 4 M). PRCV B Y320 interacts with the equivalent porcine APN residues E731 and W737. The R540 side chain in receptor-binding loop 1 forms a salt bridge with the APN E786 side chain (human APN position 778) ( Figure 4 M), whereas PRCV B R317 is electrostatically interacting with residue Q775 in porcine APN. CCoV-HuPn-2018 domain B Q545 side chain is hydrogen bonded to the canine APN N747 side chain (human APN position 739), the first N-linked NAG and to the core fucose. PRCV B Q322 forms identical interactions with porcine APN N736 and the first NAG. In receptor-binding loop 2, W586 is packed against APN residues Y797 and P798 ( Figure 4 M), and its imino group is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain carbonyl of N794 (human APN position 786). PRCV B W363 forms equivalent contacts with porcine APN residues H786, P787, and N783, respectively.
We next assessed the ability of various APN orthologs to promote cell entry of VSV particles pseudotyped with CCoV-HuPn-2018 S, TGEV S, or HCoV-229E S. Transient transfection of feline, canine, or porcine, but not human, APN, rendered HEK293T cells susceptible to CCoV-HuPn-2018 S VSV pseudovirus entry ( Figure 5 A), in line with the binding data ( Figures 4 A–4C). Feline, canine, and porcine APNs also promoted TGEV S pseudotyped virus entry into HEK293T cells ( Figure 5 B), whereas HCoV-229E-S-mediated entry occurred with feline or human APN, but not with canine or porcine orthologs ( Figure 5 C), concurring with previous data ( Li et al., 2018 39. Li, W. ∙ Hulswit, R.J.G. ∙ Kenney, S.P. ... Broad receptor engagement of an emerging global coronavirus may potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E5135-E5143 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Co-transfection of TMPRSS2 with APN did not enhance CCoV-HuPn-2018 S or TGEV S pseudovirus entry ( Figures 5 D–5F), likely reflecting the ability to employ redundant proteolytic pathways for membrane fusion to occur at the plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane, similar to HCoV-229E ( Bertram et al., 2013 7. Bertram, S. ∙ Dijkman, R. ∙ Habjan, M. ... TMPRSS2 activates the human coronavirus 229E for cathepsin-independent host cell entry and is expressed in viral target cells in the respiratory epithelium J. Virol. 2013; 87 :6150-6160 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also observed CCoV-HuPn-2018 S VSV entry in canine A72 cells ( Vlasova et al., 2021 90. Vlasova, A.N. ∙ Diaz, A. ∙ Damtie, D. ... Novel canine coronavirus isolated from a hospitalized pneumonia patient, East Malaysia Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; 74 :446-454 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells ( Figure S6 A), presumably due to endogenous APN expression. Among the cell lines evaluated, feline and one of the two canine cell lines permitted TGEV S VSV entry ( Figure S6 B), whereas only feline CRFK cells facilitated entry of 229E S pseudovirus ( Figure S6 C), concurring with the data obtained with transfected APN orthologs ( Figures 5 A–5C). Finally, we observed concentration-dependent inhibition of CCoV-HuPn-2018 S pseudotyped virus entry using purified dimeric feline, canine or porcine APN-Fc fusions ( Figure 5 G), establishing APN as a bona fide entry receptor for CCoV-HuPn-2018.
A key distinction between human APN and feline/canine/porcine APNs is the absence of an N-linked oligosaccharide at position N739 of the former ortholog due to a T to R residue substitution at position 741, which is position i + 2 of a glycosylation sequon ( Figure 5 H). Previous work showed that abrogation of this glycosylation site prevented binding of the TGEV RBD to cell-surface-expressed porcine APN and that mutations of residues i and i + 2 of this glycosylation sequon affected the receptor activity of feline APN for distinct ɑ-coronaviruses ( Reguera et al., 2012 74. Reguera, J. ∙ Santiago, C. ∙ Mudgal, G. ... Structural bases of coronavirus attachment to host aminopeptidase N and its inhibition by neutralizing antibodies PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 :e1002859 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tusell et al., 2007 87. Tusell, S.M. ∙ Schittone, S.A. ∙ Holmes, K.V. Mutational analysis of aminopeptidase N, a receptor for several group 1 coronaviruses, identifies key determinants of viral host range J. Virol. 2007; 81 :1261-1273 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structural conservation between CCoV-HuPn-2018 and TGEV/PRCV B domains along with the interactions formed between the canine APN N747 glycan and the CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain in our crystal structure ( Figure 4 M), suggest that the absence of this oligosaccharide in human APN might contribute to the lack of detectable binding and inability of CCoV-HuPn-2018 S to utilize human APN for cell entry. To evaluate this hypothesis, we generated a human APN N739 oligosaccharide knockin mutant (by introducing the R741T substitution) and assessed its ability to mediate pseudotyped virus entry. Human R741T APN rendered HEK293T cells permissive to both CCoV-HuPn-2018 and TGEV S-mediated entry ( Figures 5 A and 5B), and the human R741T APN-Fc inhibited CCoV-HuPn-2018 S pseudovirus entry in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 5 G). Conversely, the canine APN T749R oligosaccharide knockout mutant (human APN position 741) abolished binding to CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain ( Figure S5 F) and entry of CCoV-HuPn-2018 S VSV into HEK293T cells transfected with this mutant APN ( Figure 5 I), confirming the key role of this post-translational modification for receptor recognition. As the human APN R741 side chain might sterically interfere with CCoV-HuPn-2018 and PRCV/TGEV B domain binding, we assessed whether human APN R741G, which is a rare single-nucleotide polymorphism found in humans and lacks the N739 glycan, could serve as entry receptor. Neither CCoV-HuPn-2018 S or TGEV S VSV pseudotypes could enter HEK293T cells transiently transfected with human APN R741G ( Figures 5 A and 5B), lending further support to the importance of the oligosaccharide at position N739 for receptor activity. The human APN R741T oligosaccharide knockin mutant and N741G mutant remained functional as demonstrated by the retained interactions with the HCoV-229E B domain ( Figures S5 G and S5H) and the ability to support 229E S-mediated entry into HEK293T cells ( Figure 5 C) due to the distal location of the N739 oligosaccharide from the HCoV-229E attachment site ( Wong et al., 2017 100. Wong, A.H.M. ∙ Tomlinson, A.C.A. ∙ Zhou, D. ... Receptor-binding loops in Alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1735 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding of CCoV-HuPn-2018 or TGEV B domains to R741T human APN was, however, undetectable using biolayer interferometry ( Figures 4 E and 4J) or pull-down assays ( Figures S5 A and S5B), underscoring the low affinity of these interactions. Multivalent display of CCoV-HuPn-2018 S domain B, but not domain 0, at the surface of the I53-50 NP enabled detection of very weak interactions with human R741T APN, relative to canine APN, immobilized at the surface of biolayer interferometry biosensors ( Figures S5 I and S5J). Collectively, these data demonstrate that multiple APN orthologs are entry receptors for CCoV-HuPn-2018 S-mediated entry into target cells and suggest that the presence of a glycan at position N739 (human APN numbering) is a key factor for entry.
CCoV-HuPn-2018 S shares 47% amino acid sequence identity with HCoV-229E S and with HCoV-NL63 S and is therefore more distantly related to the S glycoproteins of these two endemic human-infecting ɑ-coronaviruses than they are to each other (64% sequence identity). Mapping sequence conservation between these three viruses on the CCoV-HuPn-2018 S trimer structure shows that the S 1 subunit is more divergent than the S 2 subunit ( Figures 6 A and 6B), a trend which holds true across all coronaviruses as a result of differential receptor usage and immune pressure ( Pinto et al., 2021 67.

To investigate the CCoV-HuPn-2018 cross-neutralization afforded by prior ɑ-coronavirus exposure, we evaluated the neutralizing activity of human plasma obtained between 1985 and 1987 from individuals infected with HCoV-229E ( Eguia et al., 2021 22. Eguia, R.T. ∙ Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Stevens-Ayers, T. ... A human coronavirus evolves antigenically to escape antibody immunity PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 :e1009453 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that plasma inhibiting HCoV-229E-S-mediated entry into cells also blocked CCoV-HuPn-2018 S pseudovirus entry, albeit with reduced potency ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S7 A–S7C). In contrast, TGEV-S-mediated entry was little affected by any plasma tested ( Figures 6 E and S7 A–S7C). These findings suggest that ɑ-coronavirus infection in humans elicit polyclonal antibody responses with some degree of neutralization breadth toward other coronaviruses in the same genera.
We subsequently evaluated the ability of the previously described PRCV/TGEV 1AF10 neutralizing monoclonal antibody ( Wong et al., 2017 100. Wong, A.H.M. ∙ Tomlinson, A.C.A. ∙ Zhou, D. ... Receptor-binding loops in Alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1735 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) to cross-react with the CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain. Biolayer interferometry measurements showed that the 1AF10 Fab fragment bound to the immobilized CCoV-HuPn-2018 B domain with an affinity of 17 nM with similar on and off rates than those observed for binding to the TGEV B domain ( Figures S7 D and S7E). Moreover, the 1AF10 Fab potently inhibited CCoV-HuPn-2018 S and TGEV S pseudovirus entry into HEK293T cells transiently transfected with canine, feline, porcine, and human APN N739 oligosaccharide knockin mutant (R741T) ( Figures 6 F and 6G). We also demonstrated that 1AF10 inhibits APN binding to both the CCoV-HuPn-2018 and the TGEV B domains competitively, indicating that this mAb prevents viral attachment to the host cell surface and might be a suitable therapeutic candidate against CCoV-HuPn-2018 ( Figures 6 H and 6I).

Section: Discussion

As is the case for several other ɑ-coronaviruses, CCoV-HuPn-2018 S interacts with cell surface carbohydrates ( Krempl et al., 1997 35. Krempl, C. ∙ Schultze, B. ∙ Laude, H. ...

Virol. 2010; 84 :7917-7921 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). We suggest that the two S snapshots we captured using cryo-EM correspond to two functionally distinct conformations at various stages of the entry process. These structural changes would couple domain 0 adsorption to host cell surface sialoglycans to subsequent exposure of the B domain to interact with the APN entry receptor. Subsequent protease-mediated cleavage at the S 2 ′ site would activate S for membrane fusion and enable initiation of infection. As similar conformational changes were detected for PEDV S, which also binds glycans using domain 0 ( Kirchdoerfer et al., 2021 34. Kirchdoerfer, R.N. ∙ Bhandari, M. ∙ Martini, O. ...

Virol. 2019; 93 e00923–e00919 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), we propose that this cascade of conformational changes might be conserved among several ɑ-coronaviruses.
We previously described that HCoV-NL63 S domain A N358 glycan participates in obstructing the B domain receptor-binding loops from the same protomer as a putative immune evasion strategy ( Walls et al., 2016b 95. Walls, A.C. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Frenz, B. ... Glycan shield and epitope masking of a coronavirus spike protein observed by cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 :899-905 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S8 A). The CCoV-HuPn-2018 S domain A glycan at position N404 and the domain B glycan at position N561 shield the receptor-binding loops from the same and from a neighboring B domain (to a different extent in the domain 0 proximal and swung-out conformations), respectively ( Figures S8 B and S8C), and they may play a similar role for this virus. Both CCoV-HuPn-2018 S and HCoV-NL63 S therefore appear to utilize conformational masking and glycan shielding to limit exposure of the receptor-binding loops and possibly reduce recognition by neutralizing antibodies ( Reguera et al., 2012 74.

Similarly, a longitudinal survey of HCoV-229E isolates revealed that the (B domain) receptor-binding loops evolve rapidly relative to the rest of the genome resulting in changes in receptor-binding affinity and antigenicity ( Wong et al., 2017 100.

This antigenic drift results in dampened plasma neutralization titers of HCoV-229E isolates that have emerged several years after infection ( Eguia et al., 2021 22.

A human coronavirus evolves antigenically to escape antibody immunity PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 :e1009453 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, the existence in HCoV-229E patient plasma of cross-reactive Abs with detectable neutralizing activity against CCoV-HuPn-2018 suggests that these antibodies have the potential to reduce disease severity of this virus in humans.
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the APN gene ( ANPEP ) have been previously described in humans ( Vijgen et al., 2004 88. Vijgen, L. ∙ Keyaerts, E. ∙ Zlateva, K. ... Identification of six new polymorphisms in the human coronavirus 229E receptor gene (aminopeptidase N/CD13) Int. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 8 :217-222 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pigs ( Bovo et al., 2021 9. Bovo, S. ∙ Schiavo, G. ∙ Ribani, A. ... Describing variability in pig genes involved in coronavirus infections for a One Health perspective in conservation of animal genetic resources Sci. Rep. 2021; 11 :3359 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we identified a rare R741G-carrying allele in a heterozygous individual in public databases ( STAR Methods ), which does not, however, introduce a glycosylation sequon. Moreover, we observed a near-perfect sequence conservation of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 receptor-binding loops with those of TGEV/PRCV, although they are distinct viruses. Collectively, these data along with the failure of CCoV-HuPn-2018 S to utilize wild-type human APN and its isolation using canine A72 cells ( Vlasova et al., 2021 90. Vlasova, A.N. ∙ Diaz, A. ∙ Damtie, D. ... Novel canine coronavirus isolated from a hospitalized pneumonia patient, East Malaysia Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; 74 :446-454 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ) suggest that CCoV-HuPn-2018 is not well adapted for infection and replication in human hosts. These findings also suggest that subjects infected with this novel virus or with related canine and feline coronaviruses ( Lednicky et al., 2021a 36. Lednicky, J.A. ∙ Tagliamonte, M.S. ∙ White, S.K. ... Isolation of a novel recombinant canine coronavirus from a visitor to Haiti: further evidence of transmission of coronaviruses of zoonotic origin to humans Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar ; Silva and Mullis, 2014 78. Silva, C.S. ∙ Mullis, L.B. Human respiratory coronaviruses detected in patients with InfluenzaLike illness in Arkansas, USA Virol. Mycol. 2014; 01 :004 Crossref Google Scholar ; Vlasova et al., 2021 90. Vlasova, A.N. ∙ Diaz, A. ∙ Damtie, D. ... Novel canine coronavirus isolated from a hospitalized pneumonia patient, East Malaysia Clin. Infect. Dis. 2021; 74 :446-454 Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar ) might harbor ANPEP variants introducing an oligosaccharide at position N739, which we have shown to enable CCoV-HuPn-2018 S-mediated entry. The rarity of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms is expected to restrict the zoonotic potential of CCoV-HuPn-2018 to a small number of individuals in the absence of further viral adaptations.
The detection of viruses genetically related to canine and feline coronaviruses, including CCoV-HuPn-2018, in humans across two different continents revealed that cross-species transmission of ɑ-coronavirus-1 species, which were not previously known to infect humans, might occur recurrently ( Lednicky et al., 2021a 36. Lednicky, J.A. ∙ Tagliamonte, M.S. ∙ White, S.K. ... Isolation of a novel recombinant canine coronavirus from a visitor to Haiti: further evidence of transmission of coronaviruses of zoonotic origin to humans Clin. Infect.

Clin. Virol. 2020; 128 :104391 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, demonstration of the ability of porcine deltacoronavirus to use human APN for cell entry and identification of multiple zoonotic transmission events in children in Haiti add an additional coronavirus to the growing list of emerging human pathogens ( Lednicky et al., 2021b 37. Lednicky, J.A. ∙ Tagliamonte, M.S. ∙ White, S.K. ... Emergence of porcine delta-coronavirus pathogenic infections among children in Haiti through independent zoonoses and convergent evolution Preprint at medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2018 39. Li, W. ∙ Hulswit, R.J.G. ∙ Kenney, S.P. ... Broad receptor engagement of an emerging global coronavirus may potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E5135-E5143 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the recent identification of bat merbecoviruses able to utilize ACE2 as entry receptor underscores the promiscuity of these viruses and their pandemic potential ( Xiong et al., 2022 103. Xiong, Q. ∙ Cao, L. ∙ Ma, C. ... Close relatives of MERS-CoV in bats use ACE2 as their functional receptors Preprint at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The data presented here along with continued surveillance and characterization of emerging coronaviruses will support pandemic preparedness efforts similar to prior work that enabled a rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We showed that canine, feline, and porcine APN orthologs promote CCoV-HuPn-2018-S-mediated entry into cells and that the glycan at position N747 of canine APN is critical for entry. Human APN can serve as entry receptor only if a glycan is introduced at the equivalent position (N739). Although APN single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been documented in humans, none of them introduce an N-linked glycosylation sequon at this position. Further studies will be needed to elucidate whether individuals infected with CCoV-HuPn-2018 harbor such single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

Cell lines used in this study were obtained from ATCC: Human cells epithelial embryo (HEK293T, CRL-3216), Felis catus kidney cells (CRFK, CCL-94), Canis familiaris epithelial kidney cells (MDCK, CCL-34), Canis familiaris tumor fibroblast cells (A-72, CRL-1542) and Sus scrofa pig testis fibroblast cells (ST, CRL-1746) or ThermoFisher Scientific: ExpiCHO cells and Expi293F™ cells. Cells were cultivated at 37°C, in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 and with 130 rpm of agitation for suspension cells. None of the cell lines used were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.
Genes used in this study were synthesized by GenScript, codon optimized for expression in mammalian cells, cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) between KpnI and XhoI, in frame with a Kozak’s sequence to direct translation, with the signal peptide derived from the μ phosphatase: MGILPSPGMPALLSLVSLLSVLLMGCVAETGT (except for the full-length genes in which the original signal peptide was used), and avi tag and a C-terminal octa-histidine tag. CCoV-HuPn-2018-S-2P corresponds to the sequence with the entry code: QVL91811.1 and includes residues 17 to 1387. To stabilize the spike in prefusion conformation, residues E (1140) and L (1141) were mutated to P, as previously described ( Pallesen et al., 2017 60. Pallesen, J. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike antigen Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7348-E7357 Crossref Scopus (521) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Full-length wild-type S glycoproteins from HCoV-229E (AAK32191.1) residues: 1-1,155, CCoV-HuPn-2018 (QVL91811.1) residues 1-1,425 and TGEV (ABG89335.1) residues: 1-1,425, harboring C-terminal deletions of 18-, 23- and 23-residues, respectively, were used to pseudotype VSVΔG-luc. HCoV-229E, CCoV-HuPn-2018 and TGEV RBDs matching with the full-length sequences indicated above, include residues: 293 to 434, 539 to 671 and 522 to 665, respectively, fused to an avi-tag and his tag.
Full-length APNs from human (NP_001141.2), feline (NP_001009252.2), canine (NP_001139506.1) and pig (AGX93258.1) orthologs comprise residues: 1-967, 1-967, 1-975 and 1-963, respectively. APN ectodomains from human wildtype and R741T mutant (both comprising residues 66 to 967), feline (residues 64 to 967), canine (residues 71 to 975), and pig (residues 62 to 963) from the same sequence codes shown above, were fused to a thrombin cleavage site followed by a human Fc fragment tag at the C-terminal end. The 1AF10 Fab light and heavy sequences were obtained from PDB 4F2M and cloned separately into pcDNA3.1. Only the heavy chain was fused C-terminally to a sequence encoding for a GGSGGS linker and an 8 residue-long his-tag. CCoV-HuPn-2018 domain 0 (residues 17-259), domain A (residues 260-498) and domain B (residues 523-671) were fused to the N-terminus of the trimeric I53-50A nanoparticle component ( Walls et al., 2020b 91. Walls, A.C. ∙ Fiala, B. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... Elicitation of potent neutralizing antibody responses by designed protein nanoparticle vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2020; 183 :1367-1382.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a 16 residue-long glycine and serine linker.
The plasmid for expression of TMPRSS2 full-length was obtained from Addgene ( https://www.addgene.org/53887/ ).
HKU1 S-I53-50A, NC99-NA and NC99-ferritin constructs were also synthetized by GenScript. All the protein sequences used in this study are shown in Data S1 .
The wild-type full-length human APN encoding plasmid was used as a template to introduce a glycosylation sequon at position N739 (NWR to NWT) to generate human APN R741T in a PCR reaction mixture containing: 2X Kapa HiFi (Kapa biosystems) and the following primers, each at 10 μM: forward (Fwd), 5’-aataccaacaactggaccgagatcc-3’ (underline is the codon change R to T) and reverse (Rev), 5’-atttctgaagtgaatgaagagg-3’ from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). The human APN R741G mutant was generated using the same Rev primer used to generate the R741T mutant and the Fwd primer 5’-aataccaacaactggggcgagatcc-3’. Full-length wild-type canine APN encoding plasmid was used as a template to knockout the glycan at position N747 (NWT to NWR) using the primers 5’-aactggcgggaccaccctcagacac-3’ (underline is the codon change T to R) and 5-ctgtgtgatcttctcaaagtgattg-3’ also using the 2X Kapa HiFi (Kapa biosystems). After treating the PCR products with DpnI (New England Biolabs) during 1 h at 37°C, amplified plasmids were purified using PCR & DNA cleanup kit (Monarch) treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) during 1 h at 37°C and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) at room temperature for 1 hour before being used for transformation to One Shot MAX Efficiency DH10B chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). Introduction of the desired mutations was verified by sequencing purified plasmids by GENEWIZ. Plasmid harboring the desired mutation were further amplified and purified with EndoFree mega kit (Qiagen) to be suitable for transfection into mammalian cells.
To express the prefusion-stabilized CCoV-HuPn-2018 S glycoprotein, 200 ml of ExpiCHO cells grown to a density of 6 x 10 6 /mL and 37°C, were transfected with 200 μg of CCoV-HuPn-2018-S-2P plasmid mixed with 640 l of Expifectamine CHO reagent (ThermoFisher) following manufacturer’s recommendations. The day after transfection, feed and enhancer were added to the cells. Six days post-transfection, supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 800 g for 10 minutes. Followed addition of 20 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, supernatants were further centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 min and passed through a 1 mL His trap HP column (Cytiva) previously equilibrated with binding buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 350 mM NaCl). CCoV-HuPn-2018-S-2P was eluted using a linear gradient of 500 mM imidazole.
To express B domains from CCoV-HuPn-2018, TGEV and HCoV-229E fused to an avi- and a histidine tag, 100 ml of Expi293F cells at 3 x 10 6 /mL were transiently transfected with 320 μl of Expifectamine and 100 μg of the respective plasmids, following the manufacturer’s indications. Four days post-transfection, supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 800 g for 10 minutes, supplemented with 20 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl and 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, further centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 min and passed through a 1 mL His trap HP column (Cytiva) previously equilibrated with binding buffer (25mM Tris pH 7.4 and 350mM NaCl). B domains were eluted using a linear gradient of 500 mM imidazole. A similar protocol was used to express and purify the Fab 1AF10 fused to 8 residues histidine tag except that 50 ml of Expi293F cells were transfected with a mixture containing: 50 μg of each individual plasmid encoding the Fab light and heavy chain and 160 μl of Expifectamine.
To express APN ectodomains from human, feline, canine and pig orthologs fused to Fc portion of human IgG, Expi293F cells were transiently transfected with the respective plasmids following the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, 50 ml of Expi293F cells at 3 x 10 6 /mL were transfected using 160 μl of Expifectamine and 50 μg of APN plasmid. Four days after transfection, supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 800 g for 10 minutes, supplemented with 300 mM NaCl and 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, further centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 min and passed through a 1 mL HiTrap Protein A HP column (Cytiva). Proteins were eluted using 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.0 in individual tubes containing 200 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.0 to immediately neutralize the low pH needed for elution. Fractions containing the proteins were pooled and buffer exchanged to 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. To produce APNs without the Fc fusion, the Fc fragment of all APN orthologs was removed using thrombin (Millipore Sigma) in a reaction mixture containing: 3 μg of thrombin/mg of APN-Fc, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM CaCl 2 incubated overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then loaded to a Protein A column to remove uncleaved APN-Fc and the Fc tag. Monomeric APNs were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 column 10/300 GL (GE Life Sciences) previously equilibrated in 25 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl.
HKU1 S-I53-50A protein was produced in Expi293F cells grown in suspension using Expi293F expression medium (Life Technologies) at 33°C, 70% humidity, 8% CO2 rotating at 150 rpm. The cultures were transfected using PEI-MAX (Polyscience) with cells grown to a density of 3.0 million cells per mL and cultivated for 3 days. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 4000 rpm), addition of pDADMAC solution to a final concentration of 0.0375% (Sigma Aldrich, #409014), and a second spin (5 min at 4000 rpm). HKU1-S-I53-50A protein containing His tag was purified from clarified supernatants via a batch bind method where each clarified supernatant was supplemented with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 50 mM and 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of 300 mM. Talon cobalt affinity resin (Takara) was added to the treated supernatants and allowed to incubate for 15 min with gentle shaking. Resin was collected using vacuum filtration with a 0.2 mm filter and transferred to a gravity column. The resin was washed with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted with 3 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole. The batch bind process was then repeated and the first and second elutions combined. SDS-PAGE was used to assess purity. HKU1-S-I53-50A fusion protein IMAC elution was concentrated to > 1 mg/mL and subjected to three rounds of dialysis into 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% w/v Histidine, and 5% glycerol in a hydrated 10K molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Thermo Scientific).
To produce HA-ferritin nanoparticles, 1 mg/L of NC99-ferritin vector was transiently transfected together with 0.05 mg/L of NC99 neuraminidase (NA) vector into Expi293F using polyethylenimine transfection reagent. Four days after transfection, culture supernatants were collected and sterile filtered. HA-ferritin NPs were purified by lectin affinity chromatography (EY labs), followed by size-exclusion chromatography with a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL (GE) in 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol.
B domains from HCoV-229E, TGEV and CCoV-HuPn-2018 were biotinylated using BirA biotin-protein ligase standard reaction kit (Avidity) following manufacturer's protocol. In a typical reaction, 40 μM of B domains were incubated overnight at 4°C with 2.5 μg of BirA enzyme in reaction mixtures containing 1X BiomixB, 1X BiomixA and 40 μM BIO200. Domains B were further separated from Bir A by SEC using Superdex 75 increase 10/300 GL (GE LifeSciences) and concentrated using 10 kDa filters (Amicon).
APNs binding measurements to B domains were performed using Biolayer interferometry. Biotinylated B domains from CCoV-HuPn-2018, TGEV and HCoV-229E were immobilized at 1 μg/mL in undiluted 10X kinetics buffer (Pall) to streptavidin (SA) biosensors that were pre-hydrated in water for at least 10 minutes and then equilibrated into 10X Kinetics Buffer (Pall). The loaded tips were then dipped into a dilution series of APN orthologs from human (wild-type or glycan knockin R741T), feline, canine (wild-type or T749R, and porcine or 1AF10 Fab in 10X Kinetics Buffer (Pall) starting at various concentrations for 300 seconds prior to 300 seconds dissociation in 10X Kinetics buffer for kinetics determination. The data were baseline subtracted and the plots fitted using the Pall FortéBio/Sartorius analysis software (v.12.0). Data were plotted in Graphpad Prism (v.9.0.2). These experiments were done side-by-side with two different batches of B domains and APN orthologs preparations. For competition BLI experiments, CCoV-HuPn-2018 or TGEV biotinylated RBD were immobilized at 1 μg/mL in undiluted 10X kinetics buffer (Pall) to SA sensors that were pre-hydrated in water for at least 10 minutes and then equilibrated into 10X Kinetics Buffer (Pall). B domain-loaded SA biosensors were sequentially dipped in a solution containing the 1AF10 Fab at concentrations ten times above the respective affinity (170 nM for CoV-HuPn-2018 or 100 nM for TGEV) and then in a solution containing the same concentration of 1AF10 supplemented with orthologs APN at concentrations 10X above their respective apparent affinity.
For nanoparticles experiments, canine and human R741T APN-Fc ectodomains were immobilized at the surface of protein A biosensors at 2 μg/ml and were dipped in 1 μM of CCoV-HuPn-2018-Domain0-NPs or CCoV-HuPn-2018-DomainB-NPs diluted in 10X Kinetics Buffer (Pall). Data were baseline subtracted and fit using the Pall FortéBio/Sartorius analysis software (v.12.0). Data were plotted in Graphpad Prism (v.9.0.2).
The interaction between APN orthologs and B domains was further analyzed performing a pull-down assay. Briefly, 200 μl (2 mg) of magnetic beads Dynabeads™ Strep Isolation (ThermoFisher) were washed twice with 300 μL 1X TBS-T (2.4 g Tris-Base/L, 8 g NaCl/L, 0.1 % Tween20) using a magnetic stand (ThermoFisher) before coupling them with 200 μl of B domains in TBS at 0.125 ng/ml. The mixture beads/protein were well mixed and incubated for 1h at room temperature with constant gentle rotation. Beads were then washed two times with 200 μL TBS-T before resuspending them in a solution containing an excess of 10-20X of their calculated K D,app using BLI, of the APN-Fc orthologs and allow binding for 1 hr at RT with gentle rotation after which were washed two times with TBS-T. Flow through, last wash and beads were collected and analyzed in SDS-PAGE gel. Control assays consisted of beads alone, i.e: not coupled to B domains.
The I53-50A and I53-50B proteins were expressed as described before ( Walls et al., 2020b 91. Walls, A.C. ∙ Fiala, B. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... Elicitation of potent neutralizing antibody responses by designed protein nanoparticle vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2020; 183 :1367-1382.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, transformed Lemo21(DE3) (NEB) in LB (10 g Tryptone, 5 g Yeast Extract, 10 g NaCl) were grown at 37°C to an OD600 ∼0.8 with agitation. Expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG and temperature was reduced to 18°C. Cells were harvested after ∼16 h and lysed by microfluidization using a Microfluidics M110P at 18,000 psi in 50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 0.75% CHAPS. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 24,000 g for 30 min and applied to a 2.6 × 10 cm Ni Sepharose 6 FF column (Cytiva) for purification by IMAC on an AKTA Avant150 FPLC system (Cytiva). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 30 mM to 500 mM imidazole in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% CHAPS buffer. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated in 10K MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore), sterile filtered (0.22 μm) and applied to either a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300, or HiLoad S200 pg GL SEC column (Cytiva) previously equilibrated in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% CHAPS buffer.
Concentration of purified individual nanoparticle components was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and the corresponding calculated extinction coefficients. Nanoparticles were prepared by incubation of domain A-I53-50A or domain B-I53-50A or HKU1-S-I53-50A trimers with pentameric I53-50B at molar ratios 1.1:1, respectively, in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% w/v CHAPS. Formation of Domain 0-NPs required mixing domain 0-I53-50A with I53-50A at a molar ratio of 1:6 with pentameric I53-50B. All in vitro assemblies were incubated at room temperature with gentle rocking for at least 30 min before subsequent purification by SEC on a Superose 6 column to remove residual unassembled components. Fractions were analyzed by negative stain electron microscopy and by PAGE-SDS. Assembled particles eluted in the void volume of a Superose 6 column and were pooled and stored at 4°C.
Nanoparticles diluted to 0.01 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, were adsorbed to glow-discharged home-made carbon-coated copper grids for 30 seconds. The excess liquid was blotted away with filter paper (Whatman 1) and 3 μL of 2% w/v uranyl formate stain were applied to the grids. Finally, the stain was blotted away, and the grids were allowed to air dry for 1 min. Grids were imaged on a 120kV FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit with a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 4k x 4k CCD camera at 67,000 nominal magnification using a defocus ranging between 1.0 and 2.0 μm and a pixel size of 1.6 Å.
The hemagglutination assays was performed according to standard procedures. Briefly, 50 μl of CCoV-HuPn-2018 domain 0, domain A, domain B NPs at 400 ng/μl were incubated with 50 μl 0.5% (diluted in PBS) turkey (Lampire biological laboratories), dog (Fitzgerald), human (Rockland Immunochemicals), pig (Fitzgerald) and rat (Fitzgerald) erythrocytes in V-bottom, 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) for 30 min at room temperature after which plates were photographed and hemagglutination was analyzed. In another experiment, eight 2-fold dilutions starting at 200 ng/μl of CCoV-HuPn-2018 Domain 0-NPs were incubated with 50 μl 0.5% turkey, dog, human and pig erythrocytes for 30 min at room temperature after which plates were analyzed. To determine whether sialic acids were involved in the interaction, human erythrocytes were pretreated for 3 h at 37 °C with neuraminidase (NA) from A. ureafaciens (Roche; diluted to 30 mU/mL in PBS), before incubation with different concentrations of CCoV-HuPn-2018 Domain 0-NPs for 1 h at room temperature. HKU1-S-NP at 220 ng/μl and HA-ferritin at 400 ng/μl were used as positive controls when incubated with 0.5% rat and turkey erythrocytes, respectively.
CCoV-HuPn, HCoV-229E (AAK32191.1, P100E isolate) and TGEV S pseudotyped VSV were generated as previously described ( Tortorici et al., 2020 83. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Beltramello, M. ∙ Lempp, F.A. ... Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms Science. 2020; 370 :950-957 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 84. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Czudnochowski, N. ∙ Starr, T.N. ... Broad sarbecovirus neutralization by a human monoclonal antibody Nature. 2021; 597 :103-108 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, HEK293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PenStrep and seeded in poly-D-lysine coated 10-cm dishes were transfected with a mixture of 24 μg of the corresponding plasmid encoding for: CCoV-HuPn S, TGEV S or HCoV-229 S, 60 μl Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) in 3 ml of Opti-MEM, following manufacturer’s instructions. After 5 h at 37°C, DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% PenStrep was added. The next day, cells were washed three times with DMEM and were transduced with VSVΔG-luc ( Kaname et al., 2010 32. Kaname, Y. ∙ Tani, H. ∙ Kataoka, C. ... Acquisition of complement resistance through incorporation of CD55/decay-accelerating factor into viral particles bearing baculovirus gp64 J. Virol. 2010; 84 :3210-3219 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 2 h, virus inoculum was removed and cells were washed five times with DMEM prior to the addition of DMEM supplemented with anti-VSV-G antibody [Il-mouse hybridoma supernatant diluted 1 to 25 (v/v), from CRL-2700, ATCC] to minimize parental background. After 18-24 h, supernatants containing pseudotyped VSV were harvested, centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 5 minutes to remove cellular debris, filtered with a 0,45 μm membrane, concentrated 10 times using a 30 kDa cut off membrane (Amicon), aliquoted, and frozen at -80°C.
For pseudotyped VSV infections and neutralizations, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for the different full-length APN orthologs (flAPN) following the protocol described by Eguia et al. (2021) 22. Eguia, R.T. ∙ Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Stevens-Ayers, T. ... A human coronavirus evolves antigenically to escape antibody immunity PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 :e1009453 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar . Briefly, HEK293T cells at 90% confluency and seeded in poly-D-lysine coated 10-cm dishes were transfected with a mixture in Opti-MEM containing 8 μg of the corresponding plasmid encoding flAPN ortholog, 1 μg of the plasmid encoding full-length TMPRSS2 and 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 5 h at 37°C, cells were trypsinized, seeded into poly-D-lysine coated clear bottom white walled 96-well plates at 40,000-50,000 cells/well and cultured overnight at 37°C. For infections, 5-10 μl of the corresponding pseudotyped VSV were mixed with 35-30 μl of DMEM and the mixture was added to the cells previously washed three times with DMEM. After 2 h at 37°C, 40 μl of DMEM were added and cells were further incubated overnight at 37°C. For neutralizations, eleven 2-fold serial dilutions of Fab 1AF10, APN ectodomains orthologs or sera, were prepared in DMEM. 20 μl of CCoV-HuPn-2018 S, HCoV-229E S or TGEV S pseudotyped VSV were added 1:1 (v/v) to each Fab1AF10, APN ectodomains or sera dilution and mixtures were incubated for 45-60 min at 37°C. After removing their media, transfected HEK293T cells were washed three times with DMEM and 40 μL of the mixture containing virus:Fab/APN ectodomains/sera were added. One hour later, 40 μL DMEM were added to the cells. After 17-20 h, 60 μL of One-Glo-EX substrate (Promega) were added to each well and incubated on a plate shaker in the dark. After 5-15 min incubation, plates were read on a Biotek plate reader. Measurements were done in duplicate with at least two biological replicates and one representative experiment is shown. Relative luciferase units were plotted and normalized in Prism (GraphPad): cells alone without pseudotyped virus was defined as 0 % infection, and cells with virus only (no sera) was defined as 100 % infection.
Most of the human sera was collected from prospective bone marrow donors in Seattle with approval from the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board in the 1980s and were stored in the Infectious Disease Sciences Biospecimen Repository at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division of the Fred Hutch Cancer Center. A few of the sera (the ones prefixed “FH”) are residual samples from Bloodworks Northwest that were collected from adults in Seattle.
15 μl of pseudotyped VSV were mixed with 4X SDS-PAGE loading buffer, run on a 4%–15% gradient Tris-Glycine Gel (BioRad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane using the protocol mix molecular weight of the Trans-Blot Turbo System (BioRad). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 at room temperature and with agitation. After 1 h, the fusion-peptide-specific S2S8 monoclonal antibody was added at 1:250 dilution and incubated overnight at 4°C with agitation. Next day, the membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and an Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated goat anti-human secondary antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-625-098) was added and incubated during 1 h at room temperature. Membrane was washed three times with TBS-T after which a LI-COR processor was used to develop the western blot.
Crystals of the CCoV-HuPn-2018-B domain-canine APN complex were obtained at 20°C by sitting drop vapor diffusion. 15 mg/ml canine APN were incubated with 3 mg/ml CCoV-HuPn-2018-B domain for 1 hour at room temperature before mixing with mother liquor solution (200 nl final volume) containing 0.1 M Na 2 HPO 4 -citric acid pH 4.2, 1.6 M Na 2 HPO 4 /K2HPO 4 . Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen using 30% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source synchrotron beamline 5.0.2 and processed with the XDS software package ( Kabsch, 2010 31. Kabsch, W. XDS Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (10895) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using Phenix-Phaser ( McCoy et al., 2007 52. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (14109) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the following models: porcine APN (PDB 4f5c) and CCoV-HuPn-2018-B domain obtained by cryo-EM in this study. Several subsequent rounds of model building, and refinement were performed using Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 23. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (16435) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Phenix-Refine ( Liebschner et al., 2019 43. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (1570) PubMed Google Scholar ) to arrive at a final model for the binary complex at 3.3 Å resolution in space group P21221. Model validation was done using Molprobity ( Chen et al., 2010 13. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (9581) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Privateer ( Agirre et al., 2015 1. Agirre, J. ∙ Iglesias-Fernández, J. ∙ Rovira, C. ... Privateer: software for the conformational validation of carbohydrate structures Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :833-834 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ).
3 μl of CCoV-HuPn-2018 S at approximately 0.3 mg/ml were loaded three times onto freshly glow-discharged lacey grids covered with a thin layer of home-made continuous carbon prior to plunge freezing using a vitrobot MarkIV (ThermoFisher Scientific) with a blot force of -1 and 2.5 sec blot time at 100% humidity and 21°C.
Data were acquired using the Leginon software ( Suloway et al., 2005 79. Suloway, C. ∙ Pulokas, J. ∙ Fellmann, D. ... Automated molecular microscopy: the new Leginon system J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151 :41-60 Crossref Scopus (1042) PubMed Google Scholar ) to control a FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan K3 direct detector and a Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated with a slit width of 20eV. The dose rate was adjusted to 3.75 counts/super- resolution pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in 75 frames of 40 ms with a pixel size of 0.843 Å and a defocus range comprised between 0.8 and 2.0 μm. Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function parameters, particle picking and extraction were carried out using Warp ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 81. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed using cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 70. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (1946) PubMed Google Scholar ) with binned particles to select well-defined particle images. Subsequently, one round of 3D classification with 50 iterations, using an ab initio-generated reference model (angular sampling 7.5° for 25 iterations and 1.8° with local search for 25 iterations) was carried out using Relion ( Zivanov et al., 2018 106. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Elife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (1861) PubMed Google Scholar ) without imposing symmetry. 3D refinements were carried out using non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2020 71. Punjani, A. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Fleet, D.J. Non-uniform refinement: adaptive regularization improves single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :1214-1221 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle images were subjected to Bayesian polishing ( Zivanov et al., 2019 107. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. A Bayesian approach to beam-induced motion correction in cryo-EM single-particle analysis IUCrJ. 2019; 6 :5-17 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Relion during which particles were re-extracted with a box size of 512 pixels at a pixel size of 0.843 Å which was followed by another round of non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC followed by per-particle defocus refinement and again non-uniform refinement. To improve the density of the domain 0, particles were symmetry-expanded and subjected to a Relion focus 3D classification without refining angles and shifts using a soft mask encompassing domain 0. Local refinement, local resolution estimation, filtering, and sharpening were carried out using CryoSPARC. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation using 0.143 criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 75. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1292) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution ( Chen et al., 2013 12. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ).
