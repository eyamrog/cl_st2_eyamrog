Title: Structural basis for VIPP1 oligomerization and maintenance of thylakoid membrane integrity


Abstract: Summary

Vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 (VIPP1) is essential for the biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes, which transform light into life. However, it is unknown how VIPP1 performs its vital membrane-remodeling functions. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of cyanobacterial VIPP1 rings, revealing how VIPP1 monomers flex and interweave to form basket-like assemblies of different symmetries. Three VIPP1 monomers together coordinate a non-canonical nucleotide binding pocket on one end of the ring. Inside the ring’s lumen, amphipathic helices from each monomer align to form large hydrophobic columns, enabling VIPP1 to bind and curve membranes. In vivo mutations in these hydrophobic surfaces cause extreme thylakoid swelling under high light, indicating an essential role of VIPP1 lipid binding in resisting stress-induced damage. Using cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM), we observe oligomeric VIPP1 coats encapsulating membrane tubules within the Chlamydomonas chloroplast. Our work provides a structural foundation for understanding how VIPP1 directs thylakoid biogenesis and maintenance.

Section: Introduction

Thylakoid membranes orchestrate the light-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis, splitting water to generate Earth’s oxygen and using the electrons and H + liberated from this reaction to produce NADPH and ATP. These bioenergetic molecules are then used to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere and convert it into the sugar that feeds Earth’s heterotrophic life. Thus, most of the energy flowing through our planet’s complex web of life originates in the intricate thylakoid membranes of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria.
Despite the central importance of thylakoids to our biosphere, we know very little about how these sheet-like membranes are constructed or how their integrity is maintained under environmental stress. Vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 (VIPP1, also known as IM30) co-evolved with thylakoids and is believed to play a key role in thylakoid biogenesis and homeostasis ( Li et al., 1994 50.

VIPP1 knockdown has also been observed to cause dramatic thylakoid swelling in Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas exposed to high light ( Nordhues et al., 2012 68.

In support of this function, overexpression of VIPP1 improves recovery of Arabidopsis from heat stress ( Zhang et al., 2016 117. Zhang, L. ∙ Kondo, H. ∙ Kamikubo, H. ...

In Synechocystis and Synechococcus , VIPP1-GFP also forms puncta, which vary in abundance and mobility in response to changing light conditions ( Bryan et al., 2014 8.

VIPP1 has no predicted transmembrane domains, but it has a strong affinity for lipids in vitro and in vivo that is mediated by its N-terminal amphipathic helix ( Li et al., 1994 50.

Adding to the enigmatic complexity of VIPP1 function, at VIPP1 and syn VIPP1 were recently reported to have GTPase activity, but VIPP1 lacks a canonical guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding domain ( Ohnishi et al., 2018 69.

Section: Results

A mechanistic understanding of the many described functions of VIPP1 requires high-resolution structural information. To date, the only available 3D structures of VIPP1 are negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) densities that lack the resolution to discern individual VIPP1 monomers (i.e., protomers) ( Saur et al., 2017 87. Saur, M. ∙ Hennig, R. ∙ Young, P. ... A Janus-Faced IM30 Ring Involved in Thylakoid Membrane Fusion Is Assembled from IM30 Tetramers Structure. 2017; 25 :1380-1390.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we determined structures of heterologously expressed syn VIPP1 rings by single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Iterative classification and refinement of ∼337,000 particles from 8,120 images yielded five different cryo-EM density maps corresponding to VIPP1 rings with C14, C15, C16, C17, and C18 rotational symmetries ( Figures 1 H and S1 A–S1D) at resolutions ranging from 3.8–5.0 Å ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Using a combination of homology modeling, ab initio structure prediction, and refinement by molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF), we built atomic models of the two <4 Å structures (C15 and C16) and then extended the model building to cover all five symmetries ( Figure S1 G).
The oligomeric structure of the syn VIPP1 ring resembles a tightly interwoven basket ( Figures 1 A–1C; Video S1 ). Contrary to a previous model that positions the VIPP1 monomers vertically, parallel to the ring’s central axis ( Saur et al., 2017 87. Saur, M. ∙ Hennig, R. ∙ Young, P. ... A Janus-Faced IM30 Ring Involved in Thylakoid Membrane Fusion Is Assembled from IM30 Tetramers Structure. 2017; 25 :1380-1390.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), the monomers are arranged horizontally into stacked layers ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Six layers are resolved in C14–C16, whereas C17 and C18 contain seven layers. The rings are tapered on both ends, with a smaller diameter at the top (layer 1) than at the bottom (layer 6 or 7) ( Figure S1 K). The VIPP1 protein is predicted to contain seven α helices (H1–H7) ( Figure 1 F; Otters et al., 2013 72. Otters, S. ∙ Braun, P. ∙ Hubner, J. ... The first α-helical domain of the vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 promotes oligomerization and lipid binding Planta. 2013; 237 :529-540 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2016 117. Zhang, L. ∙ Kondo, H. ∙ Kamikubo, H. ... VIPP1 Has a Disordered C-Terminal Tail Necessary for Protecting Photosynthetic Membranes against Stress Plant Physiol. 2016; 171 :1983-1995 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our density maps resolve five α helices, with the predicted H4 and H5 domains forming a single helix, which we named H4/5 to maintain nomenclature consistent with previous studies ( Figure 1 G). The N-terminal H1 domains of each layer align with each other to form vertical columns that face the lumen of the ring ( Figure 1 C). H2 and H3 make a coiled-coil hairpin that is connected to H4/5 by a loop of seven amino acids ( Figure 1 G). H6 protrudes on the outer surface of the ring ( Figures 1 B and S1 H–S1J). Within a layer, H3 and H4/5 together extend to pass behind two neighboring monomers, and then H6 points upward and binds the H2/H3 hairpin of the third neighboring monomer, forming the interwoven structure ( Figures 1 D and 1E). In addition, the luminal H1 columns stabilize the ring from the inside and help hold the stacked layers together. In total, each VIPP1 monomer can interact with up to 16 other monomers from three layers ( Figure S2 ).

Tour of the C15 synVIPP1 cryo-EM density map, related to Figures 1, 2, and 3 The movie tilts from top view to side view, then shows how monomers assemble into layers and layers assemble into the full ring structure. The ring is then sliced open to reveal the luminal columns of H1 helices. The extra densities corresponding to ADP nucleotide (red) and H1-bound lipids (orange) are then revealed.3
H7 was unresolved in our density maps, presumably because of flexibility. This small C-terminal helix with a predicted amphipathic structure is connected to H6 by an intrinsically disordered linker of ∼32 amino acids. Based on the position of H6 on the outer wall of the ring, it is clear that H7 extends outside of the ring. Thus, one can envision the complete VIPP1 ring as a “hairy basket” decorated with many flexible H7 domains. This structure is consistent with the dispensability of H7 for VIPP1 oligomerization ( Liu et al., 2007 53. Liu, C. ∙ Willmund, F. ∙ Golecki, J.R. ...

VIPP1 Has a Disordered C-Terminal Tail Necessary for Protecting Photosynthetic Membranes against Stress Plant Physiol. 2016; 171 :1983-1995 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), underscoring the thylakoid-specific role of H7.
Comparing our five syn VIPP1 structures ( Figures 1 H and S1 G) revealed four regions of flexibility in the VIPP1 monomer (F1–F4) that allow it to build tapered rings of different symmetries ( Figure 1 I). All four regions bend and flex to enable monomers to assemble into the different layers of a ring ( Figures 1 J and S1 L; Video S2 ). In contrast, for the same layer across the symmetries (e.g., layer 3 in C14–C18), the flexibility primarily comes from region F3 ( Figures 1 K and S1M; Video S2 ). This loop apparently enables syn VIPP1 rings to expand to reach higher symmetries with increased diameter.

Morph maps of the VIPP1 models showing monomer flexibility between ring layers and symmetries, related to Figure 1 The first half of the movie shows the flexibility of a monomer between the layers of the C16 ring, including the helix-to-coil transition in layer 1 (accompanies Figure 1J). The second half of the movie shows the flexibility of a layer 3 monomer from C14 to C18 (accompanies Figure 1K).4
To check whether unmodeled density was present, we calculated difference maps between the cryo-EM densities and the VIPP1 molecular models ( Figures 2 and 3 ). We observed a small difference density between layers 1 and 2 ( Figures 2 A and 2B) that could accommodate the structure of a bound nucleotide ( Figure 2 C). Comparison with nucleotide densities from other cryo-EM structures ( Banerjee et al., 2016 5. Banerjee, S. ∙ Bartesaghi, A. ∙ Merk, A. ... 2.3 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of human p97 and mechanism of allosteric inhibition Science. 2016; 351 :871-875 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) showed a better match with ADP than the larger density of ATPγS ( Figure S3 A). To confirm the presence of nucleotide in the syn VIPP1 structure, we subjected the purified protein to reverse-phase ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (RPIP-HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS). We detected a molecular mass corresponding to ADP ( Figures S4 A and S4B) that, we reasoned, might come from the ATP wash performed during protein purification. When we sequentially washed with ATP followed by GTP, we detected ADP and GDP in the purified VIPP1 rings ( Figure 2 F), indicating that VIPP1 may be able to bind and hydrolyze both ATP and GTP.
The VIPP1 nucleotide binding site is formed by bringing together different regions of three VIPP1 monomers, two from layer 1 and one from layer 2 ( Figure 2 C). The nucleotide is accommodated by flexibility in region F4 of layer 1, with the C-terminal portion of H4/5 opening into a short coil ( Figures 1 J and S3 B–S3D). We fit an ADP molecule into the EM density and refined the molecular model by interactive MDFF ( Goh et al., 2016 24. Goh, B.C. ∙ Hadden, J.A. ∙ Bernardi, R.C. ... Computational Methodologies for Real-Space Structural Refinement of Large Macromolecular Complexes Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2016; 45 :253-278 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealing characteristic structural and charge distribution features of a nucleotide binding pocket ( Figures 2 D, 2E, S3 E, and S3F). In our refined model, Lys133 and Arg44 from layer 2 use their positive charges to clamp the phosphates of the nucleotide. Glu126 from layer 2 and Glu179 on the opened coil of layer 1 are well positioned to orient a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate ( Figures S3 E and S3F). When the nucleotide densities from the C15, C16, and C17 rings were viewed at a lower threshold, each displayed a small additional density that could correspond to Mg 2+ ( Figure S3 A), a standard feature of NTPase pockets that helps coordinate the nucleotide. VIPP1 lacks one common element of ATP and GTP binding sites, the Walker A (ATPases) or P loop (GTPases) motif ( Walker et al., 1982 107. Walker, J.E. ∙ Saraste, M. ∙ Runswick, M.J. ...

However, there is no universal fingerprint for nucleotide binding, and other known NTPases also lack this motif ( Saraste et al., 1990 86. Saraste, M. ∙ Sibbald, P.R. ∙ Wittinghofer, A. The P-loop--a common motif in ATP- and GTP-binding proteins Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15 :430-434 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1692) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next performed in vitro nucleotide hydrolysis assays and observed that purified syn VIPP1 and cr VIPP1 can hydrolyze ATP and GTP ( Figures 2 G, S4 C, and S4D), consistent with previous reports of GTPase activity in syn VIPP1, at VIPP1, and PspA ( Ohnishi et al., 2018 69. Ohnishi, N. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Sakamoto, W. VIPP1 Involved in Chloroplast Membrane Integrity Has GTPase Activity in Vitro Plant Physiol. 2018; 177 :328-338 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ; Junglas et al., 2020b 39. Junglas, B. ∙ Siebenaller, C. ∙ Schlösser, L. ... GTP hydrolysis by Synechocystis IM30 does not decisively affect its membrane remodeling activity Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :9793 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single amino acid substitutions in syn VIPP1 Arg44, Glu126, and Glu179 (R44K, E126Q, E179Q) reduced phosphate release from ATP and GTP ( Figure 2 H), supporting our structural model of the nucleotide binding pocket. Double mutation of Glu126 and Glu179 (E126Q+E179Q) abolished phosphate release, further corroborating that these residues coordinate hydrolysis. Mutation of Lys133 to Arg (K133R) did not have a significant effect. However, residue 133 is an Arg in cr VIPP1 and PspA, possibly explaining the tolerance of the syn VIPP1 nucleotide pocket for K133R substitution. Although all syn VIPP1 proteins with single mutations in the nucleotide pocket produced ring structures, the E126Q+E179Q double mutant did not assemble into rings or rods, instead forming fragments and disorganized aggregates ( Figure S5 ). Therefore, we conclude that nucleotide hydrolysis appears to be required for in vitro oligomerization of syn VIPP1 into ring structures.
A second difference density not accounted for by VIPP1 monomers was found in the lumen of the ring specifically along the H1 columns ( Figures 3 A–3C). Previous studies have determined that H1 is required for lipid binding ( Otters et al., 2013 72. Otters, S. ∙ Braun, P. ∙ Hubner, J. ... The first α-helical domain of the vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 promotes oligomerization and lipid binding Planta. 2013; 237 :529-540 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; McDonald et al., 2015 61. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Ces, O. ... Membrane Stored Curvature Elastic Stress Modulates Recruitment of Maintenance Proteins PspA and Vipp1 mBio. 2015; 6 :e01188--e011815 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 62.

Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our structure clearly reveals the mechanism of this interaction. H1 is an amphipathic helix that orients its hydrophilic side toward the VIPP1 ring wall and its hydrophobic side toward the lumen ( Figure 3 D). As a result, the H1 columns form large hydrophobic surfaces on the inside of the VIPP1 ring ( Figure 3 C). These hydrophobic H1 columns explain how liposomes are drawn into cr VIPP1 rods ( Theis et al., 2019 101. Theis, J. ∙ Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klingler, J. ... VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) and how syn VIPP1 rings can mediate liposome fusion ( Hennig et al., 2015 31. Hennig, R. ∙ Heidrich, J. ∙ Saur, M. ... IM30 triggers membrane fusion in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7018 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extra density seen along the H1 columns is likely endogenous lipid, which is commonly co-purified with VIPP1 and PspA from E. coli cells ( Standar et al., 2008 97. Standar, K. ∙ Mehner, D. ∙ Osadnik, H. ... PspA can form large scaffolds in Escherichia coli FEBS Lett. 2008; 582 :3585-3589 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Otters et al., 2013 72. Otters, S. ∙ Braun, P. ∙ Hubner, J. ... The first α-helical domain of the vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 promotes oligomerization and lipid binding Planta. 2013; 237 :529-540 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We made structure-directed mutations to the H1 hydrophobic interface as well as to Arg residues proposed to impart specificity to negatively charged lipids ( McDonald et al., 2015 61. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Ces, O. ... Membrane Stored Curvature Elastic Stress Modulates Recruitment of Maintenance Proteins PspA and Vipp1 mBio. 2015; 6 :e01188--e011815 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 62. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Wallace, B.A. ... Structure and function of PspA and Vipp1 N-terminal peptides: Insights into the membrane stress sensing and mitigation Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 D). To our surprise, all of these H1 mutations caused syn VIPP1 to form more rod structures ( Figures 3 E, 3F, and S5 ). Thus, binding of H1 to lipids may influence how VIPP1 oligomeric assemblies form, tuning the equilibrium between rings and rods (see Discussion ). Interestingly, several H1 mutations also showed reduced phosphate release from ATP and GTP ( Figure S4 E), indicating a potential allosteric effect between lipid binding and nucleotide hydrolysis.
Based on our high-resolution structure, we made in vivo mutations in two conserved H1 residues previously shown to mediate lipid binding in PspA (F4E and V11E) ( Jovanovic et al., 2014 37. Jovanovic, G. ∙ Mehta, P. ∙ McDonald, C. ... The N-terminal amphipathic helices determine regulatory and effector functions of phage shock protein A (PspA) in Escherichia coli J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426 :1498-1511 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; McDonald et al., 2017 62. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Wallace, B.A. ... Structure and function of PspA and Vipp1 N-terminal peptides: Insights into the membrane stress sensing and mitigation Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then examined the effects on thylakoid architecture in native cells using cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling followed by in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) ( Asano et al., 2016 2. Asano, S. ∙ Engel, B.D. ∙ Baumeister, W. In Situ Cryo-Electron Tomography: A Post-Reductionist Approach to Structural Biology J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 :332-343 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rast et al., 2019 81. Rast, A. ∙ Schaffer, M. ∙ Albert, S. ... Biogenic regions of cyanobacterial thylakoids form contact sites with the plasma membrane Nat. Plants. 2019; 5 :436-446 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In low light (30 μmol photons m −2 s −1 ), both mutants grew slower than a wild-type (WT) control strain ( Figures 4 A, S6 A, and S6B). In high light (200 μmol photons m −2 s −1 ), the growth rate of F4E decreased, and V11E failed to grow at all. To test the acute effects of high-light stress, liquid cell cultures were grown to log phase in low light and then transferred to high light for 24 h. VIPP1 levels were reduced in both mutant strains compared with the WT ( Figures 4 B and S6 C–S6F), indicating that VIPP1 may be destabilized in vivo when lipid binding is impaired. However, upon shifting to high light, the mutant and WT strains all showed a similar ∼2-fold increase in VIPP1 protein levels ( Figure 4 B). Levels of the photosynthetic proteins D1, Rieske, and PsaD (subunits of photosystem II, cytochrome b 6 f, and photosystem I, respectively) were comparable between the mutants and WT in low light but up to 40% reduced in both mutants under high light ( Figures S6 C–S6F). In contrast, the thylakoid curvature-inducing protein CurT was only marginally reduced in the mutants under high light.
In WT cells, thylakoid architecture remained relatively unchanged in high light, with thylakoid lumen width expanding mildly from ∼6.5 to ∼9 nm ( Figures 4 C–4E and 4L; Video S3 ). Both mutant strains showed a moderate degree of thylakoid swelling in low light, but when shifted to high light, they both experienced extreme swelling (∼16 to ∼47 nm in F4E and ∼12 to ∼34 nm in V11E) ( Figures 4 F–4L; Video S3 ). The severity of thylakoid swelling varied between individual cells ( Figures 4 F, 4I and S6 G). As thylakoids swell, high curvature is maintained at thylakoid tips, presumably by the CurT protein ( Heinz et al., 2016 30. Heinz, S. ∙ Rast, A. ∙ Shao, L. ... Thylakoid Membrane Architecture in Synechocystis Depends on CurT, a Homolog of the Granal CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 Proteins Plant Cell. 2016; 28 :2238-2260 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under prolonged stress, the tip curvature is lost, resulting in formation of large round vesicles covered in membrane-bound ribosomes and phycobilisomes, markers of their thylakoid origin. Although both mutants experience dramatic thylakoid swelling ( Figure 4 L), it is interesting that F4E survives high light exposure better than V11E ( Figure 4 A) despite lower VIPP1 protein levels ( Figure 4 B). This result underscores the importance of Val11, which is centrally positioned on the H1 hydrophobic surface ( Figure 3 D).

In low and high light, both mutants exhibited aberrant membrane structures at the thylakoid convergence zones, regions that have been implicated in thylakoid biogenesis ( Stengel et al., 2012 98. Stengel, A. ∙ Gügel, I.L. ∙ Hilger, D. ... Initial steps of photosystem II de novo assembly and preloading with manganese take place in biogenesis centers in Synechocystis Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :660-675 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rast et al., 2015 80. Rast, A. ∙ Heinz, S. ∙ Nickelsen, J. Biogenesis of thylakoid membranes Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1847 :821-830 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead of the high-curvature convergence membranes that contact the plasma membrane ( Figures 4 D and 4E; Rast et al., 2019 81. Rast, A. ∙ Schaffer, M. ∙ Albert, S. ... Biogenic regions of cyanobacterial thylakoids form contact sites with the plasma membrane Nat. Plants. 2019; 5 :436-446 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed clusters of round membranes that appeared to contain cytosolic material ( Figures 4 G, 4H, and S7 ). Similar aberrant membranes have been observed at the thylakoid convergence zones of Chlamydomonas VIPP1 knockdown cells ( Nordhues et al., 2012 68. Nordhues, A. ∙ Schöttler, M.A. ∙ Unger, A.K. ... Evidence for a role of VIPP1 in the structural organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in Chlamydomonas Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :637-659 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating an evolutionarily conserved function.
Careful inspection of the Synechocystis tomograms also revealed structures in close perpendicular contact with thylakoid membranes that resembled membranes encapsulated by a protein coat ( Figures 4 M–4O and 5 A–5H). In situ structural measurements of the protein coat diameter and membrane-protein distance were consistent with in vitro syn VIPP1 rings and cr VIPP1 rods ( Figures 5 I and 5J). However, we also observed these coated membrane structures in some tomograms of the F4E and V11E mutants, where VIPP1 lipid binding is impaired. Therefore, if these encapsulated membranes are indeed coated by VIPP1, then the F4E and V11E substitutions may not completely ablate lipid interactions, which would be consistent with their milder phenotypes compared with the lethal VIPP1 knockout. To explore the possibility that these in situ membrane coats contain VIPP1, we next performed cryo-ET of Synechocystis cells expressing VIPP1-GFP from the endogenous locus ( Figure S8 ; Bryan et al., 2014 8. Bryan, S.J. ∙ Burroughs, N.J. ∙ Shevela, D. ... Localisation and interactions of the Vipp1 protein in cyanobacteria Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :1179-1195 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our best-aligned tomograms, we could resolve an extra layer of density decorating the outside of the protein coat ( Figures S8 A–S8D). The spacing of this extra density is consistent with GFP attached to the end of the flexible H7 domain plus seven additional linker residues that were added to this fusion protein ( Figures S8 E and S8F). Therefore, we conclude that the thylakoid-associated encapsulated membranes we observe in situ may be coated by VIPP1. Interestingly, these putative syn VIPP1 structures appear to respond to high-light stress, as we observed a ∼3-fold reduction in their abundance after shifting cells from low to high light ( Figure S8 G).
Despite the putative GFP density we observed decorating the Synechocystis structures ( Figure S8 ), the VIPP1-GFP fluorescence signal was not sufficient to enable direct correlation with cryo-ET. Because of limitations in the resolution of fluorescence microscopy and the precision of targeting by FIB milling, cryo-correlative light and EM (cryo-CLEM) is currently best suited for cellular regions spanning at least 200–500 nm that contain strong fluorescent signal ( Bäuerlein et al., 2017 7.

Post-correlation on-lamella cryo-CLEM reveals the membrane architecture of lamellar bodies Commun. Biol. 2021; 4 :137 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). To perform reliable cryo-CLEM of VIPP1 structures in situ , we used a Chlamydomonas strain overexpressing VIPP1-mCherry that exhibited abundant bright fluorescent puncta ( Figure 6 ). Accurate correlation was guided by the VIPP1-mCherry signal and cellular features, including starch granules and cell boundaries ( Figures 6 A–6D and 6H–6K). Cryo-ET of the correlated positions revealed the VIPP1-mCherry puncta to be clusters of membrane tubules coated in VIPP1 protein ( Figures 6 E–6G, 6L, and 6M; Videos S4 and S5 ). Detailed inspection of these in situ VIPP1 structures clearly showed that VIPP1 can oligomerize into helical assemblies inside the native chloroplast ( Figures 6 O–6R). The in situ VIPP1 structures varied in helical pitch and handedness ( Figures 6 Q and 6S), similar to what we observed previously with in vitro VIPP1 rods ( Figure 6 N; Theis et al., 2019 101. Theis, J. ∙ Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klingler, J. ... VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in situ VIPP1 membrane coats exhibited an even wider range of pitches and sometimes appeared disorganized ( Figures 6 P and 6T), perhaps reflecting a more dynamic nature. Intriguingly, we also observed a VIPP1 coat mediating a membrane continuity between converging thylakoid membranes and the chloroplast envelope ( Figures 6 T–6V; Video S6 ).

Our cryo-CLEM study definitively shows that cr VIPP1 can form rod-like helical assemblies that encapsulate tubular membranes within the native chloroplast. Comparison of our in vitro syn VIPP1 ring structures ( Figure 1 ) with a concurrent cryo-EM structure of a helical PspA rod ( Junglas et al., 2021 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Huber, S.T. ∙ Heidler, T. ... PspA maintains membrane integrity by an ESCRT-like membrane remodeling activity Cell. 2021; 184 Published online June 23, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar [this issue of Cell ]) reveals that VIPP1/PspA rings and rods share the same fold and oligomerize through very similar interactions. Therefore, we conclude that the molecular insights revealed by our high-resolution structures of syn VIPP1 rings are likely relevant to the variety of VIPP1 ring and rod architectures that assemble in vitro and in vivo .

Section: Discussion

The oligomer-forming helices of VIPP1 (H1–H6) are closely conserved with PspA. Therefore, the structural mechanisms revealed in our study are relevant to PspA’s role in maintaining plasma membrane integrity, which underlies bacterial pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance ( Darwin, 2013 14.

Protecting from Envelope Stress: Variations on the Phage-Shock-Protein Theme Trends Microbiol. 2017; 25 :205-216 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to PspA, VIPP1 also shares structural homology with ESCRT-III proteins (in particular, CHMP1B), which oligomerize in a similar fashion by using flexible “hinge” loops to interweave their extended α helices, forming helical assemblies of variable symmetry that bind and curve membranes ( McCullough et al., 2015 60.

This structural conservation is detailed more extensively in two concurrent studies on VIPP1 and PspA structure ( Junglas et al., 2021 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Huber, S.T. ∙ Heidler, T. ...

Like VIPP1 and PspA, ESCRT-III plays important roles in repairing cellular membranes ( Hurley, 2015 35. Hurley, J.H. ESCRTs are everywhere EMBO J. 2015; 34 :2398-2407 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mammalian cells, ESCRT-III has been implicated in nuclear envelope repair ( Denais et al., 2016 16.

One notable difference between VIPP1 and ESCRT-III is that VIPP1 rings directly bind and hydrolyze nucleotides ( Figure 2 ), whereas ESCRT-III assemblies interact with the AAA-ATPase Vps4 to mediate subunit exchange and helical filament constriction, thereby driving membrane remodeling ( Mierzwa et al., 2017 64.

VIPP1 can assemble into a wide variety of oligomeric architectures. In vitro , syn VIPP1 primarily forms rings, whereas cr VIPP1 more frequently makes extended rods ( Liu et al., 2007 53.

Theis, J. ∙ Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klingler, J. ... VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rings and rods are closely related conformations that oligomerize via very similar interactions ( Junglas et al., 2021 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Huber, S.T. ∙ Heidler, T. ... PspA maintains membrane integrity by an ESCRT-like membrane remodeling activity Cell. 2021; 184 Published online June 23, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rings and rods adopt various symmetries, with corresponding changes in diameter ( Figures 1 H and S1 K), and rods also vary in their helical pitch and even their handedness ( Theis et al., 2019 101. Theis, J. ∙ Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klingler, J. ... VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that single mutations in the H1 helix shift the equilibrium of syn VIPP1 oligomerization from rings to rods ( Figures 3 D–3F and S5 ), indicating that VIPP1 is on a tipping point between these two architectures. Because H1 binds lipids in the VIPP1 ring lumen ( Figures 3 A–3C), it is possible that membrane interactions may influence the ring-rod decision. Previous work has shown that H1 is unstructured in solution and acquires an α-helical structure upon interaction with lipids ( McDonald et al., 2017 62. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Wallace, B.A. ... Structure and function of PspA and Vipp1 N-terminal peptides: Insights into the membrane stress sensing and mitigation Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the stabilizing interactions between H1 columns and the ring wall ( Figures 1 C and S2 C), it is conceivable that lipid binding converts H1 into an α helix, which then enables H1 to form columns along the VIPP1 wall, shifting the in vitro equilibrium from parallel rod to tapered ring architecture. However, pre-formed cr VIPP1 rods can subsequently encapsulate liposomes in vitro without triggering a dramatic conversion to ring structures ( Theis et al., 2019 101. Theis, J. ∙ Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klingler, J. ... VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such a situation was recently examined for PspA rods ( Junglas et al., 2021 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Huber, S.T. ∙ Heidler, T. ... PspA maintains membrane integrity by an ESCRT-like membrane remodeling activity Cell. 2021; 184 Published online June 23, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), where the H1 helix was only seen upon membrane encapsulation, supporting the idea that lipid interactions structure H1.
In situ , cr VIPP1 assembles into membrane-encapsulating rod-like structures with right- and left-handed helices that also adopt a wide range of diameters and pitches ( Figure 6 ). Although we initially found VIPP1’s oligomeric heterogeneity surprising, it has been demonstrated that single mutations can cause extensive changes to the quaternary structure of coiled-coil helical assemblies ( Egelman et al., 2015 18. Egelman, E.H. ∙ Xu, C. ∙ DiMaio, F. ... Structural plasticity of helical nanotubes based on coiled-coil assemblies Structure. 2015; 23 :280-289 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, this heterogeneity may enable VIPP1 coats to accommodate a wide range of membrane curvatures during the biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoids.
Like actin filaments and microtubules, VIPP1 rings (and, presumably, also rods) are polar structures that bind and hydrolyze nucleotides. However, unlike these cytoskeletal structures, VIPP1 rings do not retain nucleotides bound along their lengths. It remains to be described whether and how nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are coordinated with VIPP1 oligomerization. The VIPP1 structures in our study hint at two distinct possible mechanisms depending on the polarity of oligomer assembly ( Figure 7 ). If layer 1 is the first to assemble, then nucleotide binding and hydrolysis may only promote initial nucleation of the ring structure, and subsequent extension of the structure would proceed without nucleotide binding. If layer 1 is the last to assemble, then it is possible that oligomerization proceeds through a cycle of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and release as layers are added sequentially. If VIPP1 oligomerization is nucleated on membranes, then this “hydrolysis and release” mechanism could potentially produce the thylakoid-associated putative VIPP1 structures we observed in Synechocystis cells ( Figures 4 M–4O and 5 ) as well as the VIPP1-coated membrane tubules we observed in Chlamydomonas cells ( Figure 6 ). VIPP1’s amphipathic H1 helix has a high affinity for anionic lipids ( Otters et al., 2013 72. Otters, S. ∙ Braun, P. ∙ Hubner, J. ... The first α-helical domain of the vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 promotes oligomerization and lipid binding Planta. 2013; 237 :529-540 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hennig et al., 2015 31.

VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) and can sense stored curvature elastic (SCE) stress ( McDonald et al., 2015 61. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Ces, O. ... Membrane Stored Curvature Elastic Stress Modulates Recruitment of Maintenance Proteins PspA and Vipp1 mBio. 2015; 6 :e01188--e011815 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; McDonald et al., 2017 62. McDonald, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ∙ Wallace, B.A. ... Structure and function of PspA and Vipp1 N-terminal peptides: Insights into the membrane stress sensing and mitigation Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). These two affinities may be related because anionic lipids favor curved membranes due to repulsion between their head groups ( Hirama et al., 2017 33. Hirama, T. ∙ Lu, S.M. ∙ Kay, J.G. ... Membrane curvature induced by proximity of anionic phospholipids can initiate endocytosis Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1393 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we speculate that VIPP1 may concentrate in regions with increased SCE and/or anionic lipids and oligomerize into ring and rod structures that suck up lipids as they extend from the membrane ( Figure 7 ).
VIPP1’s nucleotide binding pocket is likely conserved with PspA, which has also been observed to hydrolyze GTP ( Ohnishi et al., 2018 69. Ohnishi, N. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Sakamoto, W. VIPP1 Involved in Chloroplast Membrane Integrity Has GTPase Activity in Vitro Plant Physiol. 2018; 177 :328-338 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). When assembled, VIPP1 rings and rods are rather stable but can be disassembled efficiently by HSP70B-CDJ2-CGE1 chaperones ( Liu et al., 2005 52. Liu, C. ∙ Willmund, F. ∙ Whitelegge, J.P. ... J-domain protein CDJ2 and HSP70B are a plastidic chaperone pair that interacts with vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 Mol. Biol.

The chloroplast HSP70B-CDJ2-CGE1 chaperones catalyse assembly and disassembly of VIPP1 oligomers in Chlamydomonas Plant J. 2007; 50 :265-277 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). The interplay of membrane interaction, nucleotide hydrolysis, and chaperone binding may regulate the in vivo dynamics of VIPP1 oligomerization.
The molecular structures described in our study provide a starting point for unraveling the essential in vivo function of VIPP1 in thylakoid biogenesis. In algae and plants, thylakoid lipids originate in the chloroplast envelope ( Kobayashi, 2016 45. Kobayashi, K. Role of membrane glycerolipids in photosynthesis, thylakoid biogenesis and chloroplast development J. Plant Res. 2016; 129 :565-580 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the two membrane systems are separate, raising the question of how lipids are delivered from the envelope to the thylakoids. Because VIPP1 binds lipids and is required for thylakoid biogenesis ( Kroll et al., 2001 48. Kroll, D. ∙ Meierhoff, K. ∙ Bechtold, N. ...

Essential role of VIPP1 in chloroplast envelope maintenance in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :3695-3707 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), it has been proposed to be involved in lipid transport. Our observation of a VIPP1-coated membrane tubule connecting thylakoids with the chloroplast envelope in Chlamydomonas ( Figures 6 T–6V) provides a tantalizing hint that VIPP1 may indeed mediate lipid exchange between these compartments. Consistent with this idea, rare connections between thylakoids and the chloroplast envelope were previously reported in Chlamydomonas cells expressing WT levels of VIPP1 protein ( Engel et al., 2015 19. Engel, B.D. ∙ Schaffer, M. ∙ Kuhn Cuellar, L. ... Native architecture of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast revealed by in situ cryo-electron tomography eLife. 2015; 4 :e04889 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Synechocystis thylakoid convergence zones, where thylakoids merge into high-curvature membranes that make close contact with the plasma membrane, have been implicated in the biogenesis of thylakoids and photosystem II ( Stengel et al., 2012 98. Stengel, A. ∙ Gügel, I.L. ∙ Hilger, D. ...

Heinz, S. ∙ Rast, A. ∙ Shao, L. ... Thylakoid Membrane Architecture in Synechocystis Depends on CurT, a Homolog of the Granal CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 Proteins Plant Cell. 2016; 28 :2238-2260 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rast et al., 2019 81. Rast, A. ∙ Schaffer, M. ∙ Albert, S. ... Biogenic regions of cyanobacterial thylakoids form contact sites with the plasma membrane Nat. Plants. 2019; 5 :436-446 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In low and high light, the F4E and V11E mutants had aberrant convergence zones that lacked thylakoid connectivity and contact sites with the plasma membrane. Instead, these regions frequently contained clusters of round membranes that were filled with a variety of cytosolic material, including ribosomes, glycogen granules, and phycobilisomes ( Figures S7 ). Similar aberrant structures at thylakoid convergence zones have been observed in Chlamydomonas upon VIPP1 knockdown ( Nordhues et al., 2012 68. Nordhues, A. ∙ Schöttler, M.A. ∙ Unger, A.K. ... Evidence for a role of VIPP1 in the structural organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in Chlamydomonas Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :637-659 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the interaction of VIPP1 with membranes is likely important for shaping WT convergence zone architecture in cyanobacteria and green algae. Interestingly, despite their defective convergence zones, the F4E and V11E mutants were able to assemble multi-layered thylakoid networks that contained relatively WT levels of photosynthetic proteins ( Figures S6 C and S6D).
Our study poses the major questions of how high light causes thylakoid swelling and how VIPP1 counteracts this force to maintain thylakoid architecture. Consistent with our observations in Synechocystis ( Figure 4 L), light-induced swelling of the thylakoid lumen was previously reported in Arabidopsis ( Kirchhoff et al., 2011 42. Kirchhoff, H. ∙ Hall, C. ∙ Wood, M. ... Dynamic control of protein diffusion within the granal thylakoid lumen Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :20248-20253 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). The authors propose that swelling is caused by changes in luminal pH and a resulting increase in osmotic pressure, perhaps mediated by thylakoid-embedded ion channels. In addition to lumen acidification, high light also leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species ( Barber, 1995 6. Barber, J. Molecular Basis of the Vulnerability of Photosystem II to Damage by Light Funct. Plant Biol. 1995; 22 :201-208 Crossref Google Scholar ; Pospíšil, 2016 77. Pospíšil, P. Production of Reactive Oxygen Species by Photosystem II as a Response to Light and Temperature Stress Front. Plant Sci. 2016; 7 :1950 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ), which might exacerbate thylakoid swelling by destabilizing thylakoid proteins and lipids.
At this point, we can only speculate about how VIPP1 counteracts thylakoid swelling, but several recent studies and our own observations provide some hints. Swollen thylakoids have been reported in Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis VIPP1 knockdown cells exposed to high light intensities ( Nordhues et al., 2012 68. Nordhues, A. ∙ Schöttler, M.A. ∙ Unger, A.K. ... Evidence for a role of VIPP1 in the structural organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in Chlamydomonas Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :637-659 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2012 115. Zhang, L. ∙ Kato, Y. ∙ Otters, S. ... Essential role of VIPP1 in chloroplast envelope maintenance in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :3695-3707 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we observed thylakoid swelling in the Synechocystis F4E and V11E mutants under high light ( Figures 4 F–4L and S6 G), confirming the conservation of this phenotype between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts and specifically implicating lipid-binding hydrophobic residues in VIPP1’s H1 helix. PspA can bind damaged bacterial membranes and prevent H + leakage in vitro ( Kobayashi et al., 2007 46. Kobayashi, R. ∙ Suzuki, T. ∙ Yoshida, M. Escherichia coli phage-shock protein A (PspA) binds to membrane phospholipids and repairs proton leakage of the damaged membranes Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66 :100-109 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in vivo ( Kleerebezem et al., 1996 43. Kleerebezem, M. ∙ Crielaard, W. ∙ Tommassen, J. Involvement of stress protein PspA (phage shock protein A) of Escherichia coli in maintenance of the protonmotive force under stress conditions EMBO J. 1996; 15 :162-171 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Perhaps VIPP1 serves a similar function for thylakoids. VIPP1 membrane binding was recently observed to be enhanced by acidic conditions in vitro ( Siebenaller et al., 2020 96. Siebenaller, C. ∙ Junglas, B. ∙ Lehmann, A. ... Proton Leakage Is Sensed by IM30 and Activates IM30-Triggered Membrane Fusion Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21 :4530 Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar ), implying that VIPP1 may be able to sense H + leakage in stressed thylakoid regions. Two other recent in vitro studies observed that syn VIPP1 rings and PspA rods can disassemble upon contact with liposomes and coat broad regions of the membrane ( Junglas et al., 2020a 38. Junglas, B. ∙ Orru, R. ∙ Axt, A. ... IM30 IDPs form a membrane-protective carpet upon super-complex disassembly Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :595 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Huber, S.T. ∙ Heidler, T. ... PspA maintains membrane integrity by an ESCRT-like membrane remodeling activity Cell. 2021; 184 Published online June 23, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, coating liposomes with VIPP1 has been shown to stabilize these membranes against H + leakage ( Junglas et al., 2020a 38. Junglas, B. ∙ Orru, R. ∙ Axt, A. ... IM30 IDPs form a membrane-protective carpet upon super-complex disassembly Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :595 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains to be seen whether such large VIPP1-coated regions can form on native thylakoid sheets, which are composed of ∼70% protein ( Szalontai et al., 2000 100. Szalontai, B. ∙ Nishiyama, Y. ∙ Gombos, Z. ... Membrane dynamics as seen by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis PCC 6803. The effects of lipid unsaturation and the protein-to-lipid ratio Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509 :409-419 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is possible that small VIPP1 patches or even VIPP1 monomers in the membrane could be stabilizing. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a ∼3-fold reduction in thylakoid-bound putative syn VIPP1 structures under high-light conditions ( Figure S8 G). Perhaps the putative syn VIPP1 structures disassemble into the membrane under high-light stress to enhance thylakoid stability and then reform out of the membrane (as diagrammed in Figure 7 ) upon return to low-light conditions. We emphasize that such a model remains highly speculative and requires further experimental investigation. There may also be non-acute elements of VIPP1’s protective function; for example, we observed defective convergence zones and moderate thylakoid swelling in the F4E and V11E mutants even under constant low light ( Figure 4 ).
Our study raises many questions that require further investigation. Although nucleotide densities were clearly resolved bound to our VIPP1 ring structures ( Figure S3 A), and the binding pocket model is supported by functional mutagenesis assays ( Figure 2 H), our cryo-EM maps have insufficient resolution to directly observe how nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are coordinated. Pushing the resolution further would reveal these details, but it is a challenging task because of the asymmetric occupancy of nucleotides on one end of the VIPP1 ring. In the absence of improved resolution, molecular dynamics simulations may provide insights. One of the biggest mysteries raised by our study is the link between nucleotide hydrolysis and VIPP1 function. Although we find evidence of hydrolysis-dependent VIPP1 oligomerization in vitro ( Figures 2 H and 3 F), it was previously shown that syn VIPP1 protein denatured in urea can reassemble in buffer lacking nucleotide to form ring-like structures, arguing against the requirement of nucleotide for in vitro oligomerization ( Aseeva et al., 2004 3. Aseeva, E. ∙ Ossenbühl, F. ∙ Eichacker, L.A. ... Complex formation of Vipp1 depends on its α-helical PspA-like domain J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :35535-35541 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). The models presented in Figure 7 are quite speculative and require detailed investigation, ideally with a reconstituted system that can precisely follow the dynamics of VIPP1 assembly from monomers into rings and rods. The in vivo relevance of nucleotide hydrolysis remains unknown and would benefit from mutagenesis experiments—what is the phenotype of the hydrolysis-dead E126Q+E179Q double mutant in Synechocystis , and how does mutating these residues affect formation of in situ rod-like structures in Chlamydomonas ? An additional layer of complexity is the flexible H7 domain, which decorates the outside surfaces of VIPP1 rings and rods but is not resolved in our structures ( Figure 1 ). How do interactions with this domain regulate VIPP1 dynamics and impart its thylakoid-specific functions?
Another major question is how the VIPP1 ring and rod structures detailed in our study relate to VIPP1’s essential functions in thylakoid biogenesis and maintenance. Our results emphasize the physiological importance of lipid binding by the luminal H1 domain ( Figure 4 ). VIPP1 oligomers likely play a role in vivo , as we observed rod-like VIPP1 structures tubulating membranes within the cell and even mediating contact between thylakoids and the chloroplast envelope ( Figure 6 ). However, membrane maintenance functions have also been proposed for “carpets” of VIPP1 monomers ( Junglas et al., 2020a 38. Junglas, B. ∙ Orru, R. ∙ Axt, A. ... IM30 IDPs form a membrane-protective carpet upon super-complex disassembly Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :595 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 40. Junglas, B. ∙ Huber, S.T. ∙ Heidler, T. ... PspA maintains membrane integrity by an ESCRT-like membrane remodeling activity Cell. 2021; 184 Published online June 23, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the disorganized coats we often observed in situ ( Figures 6 P and 6T), we believe that VIPP1 is likely more dynamic inside the cell than what we observed in our in vitro structures. It will be illuminating to determine whether additional factors sequentially regulate VIPP1 oligomer architecture to direct membrane-remodeling functions, as shown for ESCRT-III ( Pfitzner et al., 2020 75. Pfitzner, A.-K. ∙ Mercier, V. ∙ Jiang, X. ... An ESCRT-III Polymerization Sequence Drives Membrane Deformation and Fission Cell. 2020; 182 :1140-1155.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also must emphasize that these in situ VIPP1-tubulated membranes were formed in Chlamydomonas cells overexpressing VIPP1-mCherry, and, thus, they likely do not occur with such abundance in WT cells. However, overexpression has been used previously to accurately visualize the in situ architecture of mammalian ESCRT-III and bacterial ParM assemblies ( Salje et al., 2009 85. Salje, J. ∙ Zuber, B. ∙ Löwe, J. Electron cryomicroscopy of E. coli reveals filament bundles involved in plasmid DNA segregation Science. 2009; 323 :509-512 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; McCullough et al., 2015 60. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ... Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It is now clear that membrane remodeling by the ESCRT-III superfamily is widespread throughout bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals. Within this superfamily, VIPP1 is highly conserved in thylakoid-bearing photosynthetic organisms, from land crops that feed billions of people to marine algae and cyanobacteria that fix half of the Earth’s CO 2 . Although much remains to be discovered, our study lays the structural foundation for a mechanistic understanding of VIPP1-mediated thylakoid biogenesis and stress resistance across the photosynthetic tree of life.

Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Benjamin D. Engel ( ben.engel@helmholtz-muenchen.de ).
All unique/stable reagents generated in this study are available from the Lead Contact without restriction. Note that the Chlamydomonas VIPP1-mCherry strain was made in the patented UVM4 background ( Neupert et al., 2009 66. Neupert, J. ∙ Karcher, D. ∙ Bock, R. Generation of Chlamydomonas strains that efficiently express nuclear transgenes Plant J. 2009; 57 :1140-1150 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ), and thus, may require a Materials Transfer Agreement from the authors of that study.
The cryo-EM density maps for the syn VIPP1 rings with C14-C18 symmetries have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB), and the corresponding atomic models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with the following accession codes: C14: PDB 7O3W , EMD-12710; C15: PDB 7O3X , EMD-12711; C16: PDB 7O3Y , EMD-12712; C17: PDB 7O40 , EMD-12713; C18: PDB 7O3Z , EMD-12714. The complete single particle dataset of raw cryo-EM micrographs has been uploaded to the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR) under accession code EMPIAR-10680. In situ cryo-tomograms of Synechocystis WT, F4E, and V11E cells, as well as Chlamydomonas cells containing cr VIPP1-mCherry structures, have been deposited in the EMDB under accession codes EMD-12324 through EMD-12330. See individual tomogram descriptions in the Key Resources Table.
Synechocystis strains (WT, vipp1-F4E , vipp1-V11E , vipp-GFP ) were grown on solid or in liquid BG11 medium ( Rippka et al., 1979 82. Rippka, R. ∙ Deruelles, J. ∙ Waterbury, J.B. ... Generic Assignments, Strain Histories and Properties of Pure Cultures of Cyanobacteria Microbiology. 1979; 111 :1-61 Crossref Google Scholar ), at 30°C and with 30 μmol photons m -2 s -1 light in the presence of 5 mM glucose, unless stated otherwise. Liquid medium was shaken at 120 rpm. For selection of mutant strains, up to 200 μg/mL kanamycin was added to solid BG11 medium.
Chlamydomonas VIPP1-mCherry cells were grown on solid or in liquid Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium, at room temperature and with 40 μmol photons m −2 s −1 light, unless stated otherwise. Liquid medium was shaken at 120 rpm. For selection of transformants, 100 μg/mL spectinomycin was added to solid TAP media.
To create the Synechocystis mutants as well as a control strain, a construct was designed containing the vipp1 gene with its flanking non-coding regions up to 549 bp upstream and 47 bp downstream of the vipp1 gene. A kanamycin resistance cassette (sequence taken from pBSL14 (ATCC 87127)) was inserted 149 bp upstream of vipp1 . The construct was ordered as a gBlock DNA fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies), blunt-cloned in the pJET1.2 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Agilent Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions to introduce the mutations F4E or V11E (primer pairs: vipp1-F4E-for + vipp1-F4E-rev, vipp1-V11E-for + vipp1-V11E-rev; Table S1 ). The sequences of both mutant constructs as well as the control construct were verified by sequencing, and the constructs were transformed into Synechocystis wild-type cells as previously described ( Eaton-Rye, 2004 17. Eaton-Rye, J.J. The construction of gene knockouts in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 274 :309-324 PubMed Google Scholar ). Complete segregation of the resulting control and mutant strains was verified by PCR (primers vipp1-seq-for + vipp1-seq-rev; Table S1 ), and the insertion of the mutations during homologous recombination was confirmed again by sequencing (primer vipp1-seq-rev).
The VIPP1 genomic sequence, including all seven introns, was modified at positions C411G, C414T, G417C, and T420C relative to the ATG start codon to change to synonymous codons but render the sequence insensitive to attack by the siRNA produced by VIPP1 -amiRNA construct pMS552 ( Nordhues et al., 2012 68. Nordhues, A. ∙ Schöttler, M.A. ∙ Unger, A.K. ... Evidence for a role of VIPP1 in the structural organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in Chlamydomonas Plant Cell. 2012; 24 :637-659 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, position C583G was modified to create a synonymous codon that removed a BbsI recognition site. The sequence was flanked with BbsI cleavage sites, which upon BbsI digestion yielded a 2786-bp fragment with AATG and TTCG overhangs for the B3/4 position of level 0 parts according to the Modular Cloning (MoClo) syntax for plant genes ( Weber et al., 2011 108.

Standards for plant synthetic biology: a common syntax for exchange of DNA parts New Phytol. 2015; 208 :13-19 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Synthesis of the sequence and cloning into the pAGM1287 vector was performed by DC Biosciences Ltd. (Scotland), giving rise to pMBS478. This level 0 part was then complemented with level 0 parts (pCM) from the Chlamydomonas MoClo toolkit ( Crozet et al., 2018 13. Crozet, P. ∙ Navarro, F.J. ∙ Willmund, F. ... Birth of a Photosynthetic Chassis: A MoClo Toolkit Enabling Synthetic Biology in the Microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ACS Synth. Biol. 2018; 7 :2074-2086 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) to fill the respective positions in level 1 modules as follows: A1-B2 – pCM0-020 ( HSP70A - RBCS2 promoter + 5′UTR); B5 – pCM0-108 (mCherry (i1)); B6 – pCM0-119 (RPL23 3′UTR). The HSP70A - RBCS2 fusion promoter contains 467 bp of sequence upstream of the HSP70A start codon in optimal spacing with respect to the RBCS2 promoter ( Lodha et al., 2008 55.

The latter was then combined with pCM1-01 (level 1 module with the aadA gene conferring resistance to spectinomycin) from the Chlamydomonas MoClo kit, with plasmid pMBS678 containing the VIPP2 gene fused to mVenus, with plasmid pICH41766 containing the proper end-linker, and with destination vector pAGM4673 ( Weber et al., 2011 108.

Transformants were selected on 100 μg/mL spectinomycin.
The region coding for wild-type syn VIPP1 was amplified from Synechocystis genomic DNA using primers VIPP1-SpeI-SapI and VIPP1-XhoI ( Table S1 ). The 839-bp PCR product was digested with SapI and XhoI and ligated into SapI–XhoI-digested pTYB11 (NEB), generating pMS451. The region coding for wild-type cr VIPP1 was cloned into pTYB11 (pMS319) previously ( Liu et al., 2005 52. Liu, C. ∙ Willmund, F. ∙ Whitelegge, J.P. ... J-domain protein CDJ2 and HSP70B are a plastidic chaperone pair that interacts with vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16 :1165-1177 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single mutations were introduced by PCR (30 s at 98°C, 20 s at 63-70°C, 7.5 min at 72°C) using the primer pairs given in Table S1 and pMS451 or pMS319 as templates. For the syn VIPP1 E126Q+E179Q double mutant, the plasmid harboring the E126Q mutant was used as a template. PCR products were phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and circularized with T4 DNA ligase (NEB). Correct cloning was verified by Sanger sequencing. All syn VIPP1 and cr VIPP1 variants and the CGE1a protein (pMS300) ( Willmund et al., 2007 112. Willmund, F. ∙ Mühlhaus, T. ∙ Wojciechowska, M. ... The NH2-terminal domain of the chloroplast GrpE homolog CGE1 is required for dimerization and cochaperone function in vivo J. Biol.

For this, a 10 mL overnight culture was diluted into 1 L TB containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and grown at 37°C for 7-8 h. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and growth continued at 18°C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 g and 4°C for 10 min, resuspended in 25 mL ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, Roche cOmplete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) and sonicated. After centrifugation at 20,000 g and 4°C for 30 min, the supernatant was passed twice at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min through a column with 6 mL chitin beads (NEB) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was then washed with 100 mL lysis buffer at 2 mL/min, followed by a wash with 10 mL KMH buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 80 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 ) containing 5 mM ATP to remove DnaK binding to VIPP1. For the GTP-exchange mass spectrometry experiment ( Figure 2 F), an additional wash was performed with 5 mM GTP in 10 mL KMH buffer. After a final wash with 20 mL lysis buffer lacking Triton at 2 mL/min, the column was flushed with 10 mL cleavage buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM DTT), gently agitated overnight at room temperature, and the recombinant protein slowly eluted. Elution was finalized with 5 mL KMH buffer to yield ∼10 mL of eluate, which was then concentrated to 1–2 mL by centrifugation at 4500 g using a Millipore concentrator (AMICON MWCO 3,000). The concentrate was diluted with 20 mL buffer and reconcentated back to 1–2 mL four times: twice with dialysis buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 75 mM NaSCN) and then twice more with dialysis buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 75 mM NaSCN). After the final run, the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. The purity of the protein preps was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie stain ( Figure S1 A). Proteins were either kept on ice for analysis by cryo-EM, or quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C.
5 μL of purified syn VIPP1 protein was applied to glow discharged, 200 mesh copper grids (G2200C, Plano GmbH) that had been coated with homemade carbon film. The sample was incubated for 2 min, blotted, washed three times with water, and then stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 s. Images were recorded using a Tecnai F20 FEG microscope (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 200 kV, with an FEI Eagle CCD camera, a calibrated pixel size of 2.21 Å, and a defocus range of −2 to −5 μm.
Cryo-EM grids were prepared with freshly purified syn VIPP1 protein at a concentation of 1–2 mg/mL. 4 μL of the protein was applied to glow discharged, holey carbon-coated copper grids (R 2/1, 200 mesh, Quantifoil Micro Tools). Grids were plunge-frozen in a liquid ethane/propane mixture using a Vitrobot Mark 4 (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blotting chamber conditions were set to 4 °C and 95% humidity, and grids were blotted using blot force 10 and a blot time of 10 sec. Grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until usage. Images were acquired on a Titan Krios microscope (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 300 kV, using a post-column energy filter (Quantum, Gatan) and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) operated in counting mode. For each image, 80 frames were acquired over 8 s, with a total dose of ∼45 e - /Å 2 . A total of 8120 images were recorded, using a calibrated pixel size of 1.35 Å and a defocus range of −0.5 to −3.5 μm.
See the workflow in Methods S1 . The frame stacks were subjected to alignment with 5x5 patches and dose filtering using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 118. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (1982) PubMed Google Scholar ), yielding 8120 aligned and dose-weighted micrograph images ( Figure S1 B, Methods S1 A). Automated particle picking was performed with crYOLO ( Wagner et al., 2019 106. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ) by training on a small dataset of 80 manually-picked images and then using this trained network to pick particles from the full dataset. All subsequent image processing was carried out using the RELION 3.0 software suite ( Zivanov et al., 2018 119. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (1116) PubMed Google Scholar ). CTF parameters were determined using Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 114. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (1297) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the crYOLO picking, ∼337,000 particles were extracted (defined as Dataset-A). After particle extraction, the dataset was cleaned using reference-free 2D classification ( Figure S1 C), yielding ∼263,000 particles (defined as Dataset-B).
To generate a reference-free initial 3D model, we used a RELION implementation of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) ( Punjani et al., 2017 78. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (1085) PubMed Google Scholar ) without applying symmetry ( Methods S1 B). The SGD algorithm allows for ab initio heterogeneous structure determination without a prior reference map. Starting with Dataset-B, a very rough class was obtained from ∼33,000 particles. Another round of SGD was performed using these particles, and ∼20,000 particles were selected to produce an improved 3D map exhibiting C17 symmetry. Using this volume as a reference, 3D classification of the ∼20,000 particles was performed without applying symmetry constraints. The 3D classification split the particles into several classes, yielding 3D maps for both C15 and C17 symmetries. Using these two volumes as references, a new 3D classification of the full Dataset-B was performed, while enforcing symmetry constraints ( Methods S1 C). This split the particles into two large classes (C15 and C17) and generated improved 3D maps to be used as references for the next round of 3D classification. To obtain homogeneous classes of particles, ∼120,000 particles from the C15 class and ∼62,000 particles from the C17 class were subjected to several rounds of 3D classification ( Methods S1 D). These classifications split the particles into new classes with C14, C15, C16, C17 and C18 symmetries. Several rounds of 3D refinement were performed for these symmetry classes, yielding 3D structures with resolutions ranging from 4.5 Å to 6.5 Å ( Methods S1 E).
When further rounds of 3D classification and refinement did not improve the resolution of Dataset-B, the final density maps of each symmetry were used as references for 3D classification of the full Dataset-A (∼337,000 particles) ( Methods S1 F and S1G). The reason behind this was to extract the particles directly from the initial dataset based on the specific 3D references corresponding to each symmetry class. Coarse angular sampling (7.5°) was applied to speed up the classification process, and the dataset was divided into five classes corresponding to specific symmetries ( Methods S1 F). Each symmetry class was then subjected to several rounds of 3D classification with fine angular sampling (3.5°) ( Methods S1 G). The goal of this step was to clean the classes further, increasing the structural homogeneity of the particles.
The final classes were next processed through iterative rounds of RELION 3D auto-refinement to improve the alignment ( Scheres, 2012 91. Scheres, S.H.W. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (2316) PubMed Google Scholar ), per-particle CTF refinement to estimate the defocus and astigmatism of each particle ( Zivanov et al., 2018 119. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (1116) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Bayesian polishing to correct for the motion of each particle (using frames 3-50) and filter for the radiation damage ( Zivanov et al., 2019 120. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. A Bayesian approach to beam-induced motion correction in cryo-EM single-particle analysis IUCrJ. 2019; 6 :5-17 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ; Methods S1 H and S1I). Alignment was carried out following the “gold-standard” procedure, which randomly splits the dataset into two half sets and aligns them independently. This allowed calculation of a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curve for resolution estimation ( Figure S1 E) using the FSC = 0.143 threshold criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 83. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution maps ( Figure S1 F) were generated with the RELION local resolution function ( Cardone et al., 2013 10. Cardone, G. ∙ Heymann, J.B. ∙ Steven, A.C. One number does not fit all: mapping local variations in resolution in cryo-EM reconstructions J. Struct. Biol. 2013; 184 :226-236 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cryo-EM map and molecular model statistics are listed in Methods S1 J. Images of the cryo-EM density maps were generated with UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 74. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (22421) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 23. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (840) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The initial PDB structure of syn VIPP1 was obtained by homology modeling with Modeler software ( Sali and Blundell, 1993 84. Sali, A. ∙ Blundell, T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234 :779-815 Crossref Scopus (9831) PubMed Google Scholar ) starting with the available crystal structure of E. coli PspA (PDB: 4WHE , corresponding to helices H2 and H3 of VIPP1) ( Osadnik et al., 2015 71. Osadnik, H. ∙ Schöpfel, M. ∙ Heidrich, E. ... PspF-binding domain PspA1-144 and the PspA·F complex: New insights into the coiled-coil-dependent regulation of AAA+ proteins Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 98 :743-759 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the syn VIPP1 sequence (UniProt: A0A068MW27). Domains not resolved in the crystal structure (residues 2-25 and 142-216, corresponding to helices H1, H4/5, and H6) were modeled using the Rosetta ( Leaver-Fay et al., 2011 49. Leaver-Fay, A. ∙ Tyka, M. ∙ Lewis, S.M. ... Chapter nineteen - Rosetta3: An Object-Oriented Software Suite for the Simulation and Design of Macromolecules Johnson, M.L. ∙ Brand, L. (Editors) Methods in Enzymology Academic Press, 2011; 545-574 Google Scholar ) ab initio structure prediction framework implemented as a plugin in VMD software ( Humphrey et al., 1996 34. Humphrey, W. ∙ Dalke, A. ∙ Schulten, K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 33–38, 27–38 Crossref Scopus (30929) PubMed Google Scholar ). This framework was initially developed to furnish the structurally unresolved regions of the 26S proteasome ( Schweitzer et al., 2016 95. Schweitzer, A. ∙ Aufderheide, A. ∙ Rudack, T. ... Structure of the human 26S proteasome at a resolution of 3.9 Å Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :7816-7821 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not model the VIPP1 C terminus (residues 217-267, corresponding to H7 and a disordered linker), as it was not resolved within the EM density map, presumably due to its highly dynamic nature ( Figures 1 F and 1G). The models were clustered using the k-means algorithm. For each symmetry, single subunits for each layer of the VIPP1 ring were segmented.
Each of the clusters obtained was fitted into the segmented maps using molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) ( Trabuco et al., 2008 103. Trabuco, L.G. ∙ Villa, E. ∙ Mitra, K. ... Flexible fitting of atomic structures into electron microscopy maps using molecular dynamics Structure. 2008; 16 :673-683 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (580) PubMed Google Scholar ). MDFF employs molecular dynamics to fit initial models into a density in real space, and thus, permits protein flexibility while maintaining realistic protein conformations ( Goh et al., 2016 24. Goh, B.C. ∙ Hadden, J.A. ∙ Bernardi, R.C. ... Computational Methodologies for Real-Space Structural Refinement of Large Macromolecular Complexes Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2016; 45 :253-278 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used NAMD ( Phillips et al., 2005 76. Phillips, J.C. ∙ Braun, R. ∙ Wang, W. ... Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26 :1781-1802 Crossref Scopus (11812) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the CHARMM36 force field for MDFF calculations. During MDFF runs, restraints to preserve the secondary structure, chirality, and cis-peptide bonds were applied to avoid overfitting. As further step to reduce artifacts due to overfitting, all MDFF runs were performed at a modest gscale of 0.3.
After MDFF convergence, the cross-correlation coefficient for the clusters was calculated, and the structure showing the highest correlation was used for subsequent steps. Once subunits for each segment were fitted by interactive MDFF, the entire structure was created by applying the respective symmetry operation (C14, C15, C16, C17, and C18) on the model. The whole structure was then refined using MDFF and symmetry-adapted constraints to apply a harmonic potential to the symmetry-averaged positions of each individual VIPP1 subunit within the complete ring. After this refinement, the structures were re-symmetrized with Biopython ( Hamelryck and Manderick, 2003 27. Hamelryck, T. ∙ Manderick, B. PDB file parser and structure class implemented in Python Bioinformatics. 2003; 19 :2308-2310 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ) using six selected monomers, one from each layer of the VIPP1 ring. Steric clashes between the symmetry subunits were removed by MDFF energy minimization of the whole structure into the cryo-EM density map. The interaction network between VIPP1 monomers in the ring ( Figure S2 D) was generated using MDAnalysis ( Michaud-Agrawal et al., 2011 63. Michaud-Agrawal, N. ∙ Denning, E.J. ∙ Woolf, T.B. ... MDAnalysis: a toolkit for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations J. Comput. Chem. 2011; 32 :2319-2327 Crossref Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the distances between residues within the VIPP1 structure.
The initial prediction of a nucleotide binding site in syn VIPP1 was performed using the GTPbinder ( Chauhan et al., 2010 12. Chauhan, J.S. ∙ Mishra, N.K. ∙ Raghava, G.P.S. Prediction of GTP interacting residues, dipeptides and tripeptides in a protein from its evolutionary information BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11 :301 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ATPint ( Chauhan et al., 2009 11. Chauhan, J.S. ∙ Mishra, N.K. ∙ Raghava, G.P. Identification of ATP binding residues of a protein from its primary sequence BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :434 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) web servers. AutoDock4 ( Morris et al., 2009 65. Morris, G.M. ∙ Huey, R. ∙ Lindstrom, W. ... AutoDock4 and AutoDockTools4: Automated docking with selective receptor flexibility J. Comput. Chem. 2009; 30 :2785-2791 Crossref Scopus (10046) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to predict possible nucleotide binding modes. We aligned the ADP from the human 26S proteasome structure (PDB: 5L4G ) ( Schweitzer et al., 2016 95. Schweitzer, A. ∙ Aufderheide, A. ∙ Rudack, T. ... Structure of the human 26S proteasome at a resolution of 3.9 Å Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :7816-7821 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with the best scoring result. The model of the nucleotide binding region was further refined to the density in real space by an iterative combination of MDFF with ab initio structure prediction as well as Monte Carlo-based backbone and side-chain rotamer search algorithms, following the strategy detailed in Wehmer et al. (2017) 109. Wehmer, M. ∙ Rudack, T. ∙ Beck, F. ... Structural insights into the functional cycle of the ATPase module of the 26S proteasome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :1305-1310 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar . Subsequently, we further refined the nucleotide binding pocket using interactive MDFF to manually pull side chains into EM density, while interactively checking the cross-correlation values in VMD.
Finally, the complete structure was refined with Phenix software ( Liebschner et al., 2019 51. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (760) PubMed Google Scholar ) real space refinement with reference coordinate restraints (σ = 0.05) on the nucleotide binding site. The resulting structure was re-symmetrized.
The ATP and GTP wash steps were performed during purification while the VIPP1 protein was bound to the chitin column, as described above. Purified VIPP1 at a concentration of 1 μM was injected onto a C18 column (Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18, 2.1 × 100 mm 2 , pore size 3.5 μm), mounted on an Agilent 1290 HPLC apparatus. Bound ligands were eluted at 250 μL/min using a gradient of buffer A (20 mM triethylammonium acetate (pH 9.0)) and buffer B (20 mM triethylammonium acetate (pH 9.0), 20% acetonitrile) as previously described ( Gat et al., 2019 22. Gat, Y. ∙ Schuller, J.M. ∙ Lingaraju, M. ... InsP 6 binding to PIKK kinases revealed by the cryo-EM structure of an SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 complex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :1089-1093 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). The experiment was conducted at pH 9.0, with the mass spectrometer (maXis II ETD, Bruker) operating in negative ion mode, with a mass range of 200–1,200 m/z and collision cell energy of −10.0 eV to accommodate detection of the negatively charged compounds. Therefore, the masses of both ADP and GDP are off by −1 Da ( Figures 2 F, S4 A, and S4B).
ATP and GTP hydrolysis assays were carried out as previously described ( Ohnishi et al., 2018 69. Ohnishi, N. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Sakamoto, W. VIPP1 Involved in Chloroplast Membrane Integrity Has GTPase Activity in Vitro Plant Physiol. 2018; 177 :328-338 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) with slight modifications, using ATPase and GTPase assay kits (Expedeon Ltd.) that employ a malachite green-based detection system with PiColorLock™. All reactions were performed in a 200 μL volume according to the manufacturer instructions. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM ATP or GTP, and purified syn VIPP1 or cr VIPP1 recombinant protein. The ATP hydrolysis assay was performed with 12 μg of recombinant protein, whereas the GTP hydrolysis assay was performed with either 6 μg of syn VIPP1 or 4 μg of cr VIPP1 protein. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and were then immediately cooled in ice water for 1 min. Subsequently, each reaction was terminated by adding 50 μL of PiColorLock™ at room temperature. Unless specifically described, the 30 min incubation time was used as the standard condition. The released Pi in each reaction mixture was quantified by measuring absorption at 635 nm according to the calibration curve obtained from the absorption of Pi standard solutions (see Figure S4 C). Because stock solutions of ATP and GTP always contain a trace amount of free Pi, measurements were normalized by the background absorption value of reaction mixture that had not been supplemented with recombinant protein to obtain VIPP1-dependent Pi release.
For growth analysis, log-phase Synechocystis cultures grown in low light (30 μmol photons m -2 s -1 ) were adjusted to OD 750 = 1 and dilution series were prepared up to OD 750 = 10 −4 . Next, 5 μl of each dilution and strain were spotted on solid BG11 with and without glucose. Plates were incubated in low light and high light (200 μmol photons m -2 s -1 ) and the results were documented after 5 days of growth.
For analysis of whole cell protein accumulation, Synechocystis pre-cultures were grown in low light for 2 days until they reached log phase. Main cultures were inoculated to OD 750 = 0.1 and grown in low light or high light for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) and broken using a BeadBug Homogenizer (Biozym) and glass beads in three cycles of alternating 20 s shaking and 1 min incubation on ice. Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged (20,000 g, 1 min 4°C) and the supernatant protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay using RotiQuant (Carl Roth GmbH + Co. KG). Samples were subjected to western blot analysis, and quantification of the results from three independent biological replicates was performed using the ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). Generation of the antibodies used in this study has been described previously: αCurT ( Heinz et al., 2016 30. Heinz, S. ∙ Rast, A. ∙ Shao, L. ...

Growth of Synechocystis WT, vipp1-F4E , and vipp1-V11E strains for in situ cryo-ET was performed identically as described above for physiological and biochemical analysis. The vipp1-GFP strain was grown at 8 μmol photons m −2 s −1 for the very low light condition and transferred to 600 μmol photons m −2 s −1 for 1 h for the very high light condition, as described in Bryan et al. (2014) 8. Bryan, S.J. ∙ Burroughs, N.J. ∙ Shevela, D. ... Localisation and interactions of the Vipp1 protein in cyanobacteria Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 :1179-1195 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar . Using a Vitrobot Mark 4 (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 4 μL of cell culture was blotted onto R 1/4 SiO 2 -foil 200-mesh gold EM grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools) and plunge frozen in a liquid ethane/propane mixture. Grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until used for FIB milling. Cryo-FIB milling was performed essentially as previously described ( Schaffer et al., 2015 88. Schaffer, M. ∙ Engel, B.D. ∙ Laugks, T. ... Cryo-focused ion beam sample preparation for imaging vitreous cells by cryo-electron tomography Bio Protoc. 2015; 5 :e1575 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 89. Schaffer, M. ∙ Mahamid, J. ∙ Engel, B.D. ... Optimized cryo-focused ion beam sample preparation aimed at in situ structural studies of membrane proteins J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :73-82 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), using an Aquilos dual-beam FIB/SEM instrument (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Grids were clipped into Autogrid support rings modified with a cut-out that allows access to the ion beam at low angle (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In the FIB/SEM chamber, the grids were sputter-coated with metallic platinum to reduce charging, then coated with a thicker layer of organometallic platinum using a gas injection system to protect the sample surface. Micro-expansion joints (relief cuts) were milled to release stress in the support film and help prevent lamella bending ( Wolff et al., 2019 113. Wolff, G. ∙ Limpens, R.W.A.L. ∙ Zheng, S. ... Mind the gap: Micro-expansion joints drastically decrease the bending of FIB-milled cryo-lamellae J. Struct. Biol. 2019; 208 :107389 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cells were then milled with a gallium ion beam to produce lamellae of 100-200 nm thickness, and the grids were transferred out of the FIB/SEM and stored in liquid nitrogen until imaged by cryo-ET.
Grids containing milled samples were transferred into a 300 kV Titan Krios microscope (FEI Thermo Fisher), equipped with a post-column energy filter (Quantum, Gatan), and a direct detector camera (K2 summit, Gatan). Using SerialEM software ( Mastronarde, 2005 59. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (1782) PubMed Google Scholar ), dose-symmetric tilt-series were acquired ( Hagen et al., 2017 26. Hagen, W.J.H. ∙ Wan, W. ∙ Briggs, J.A.G. Implementation of a cryo-electron tomography tilt-scheme optimized for high resolution subtomogram averaging J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :191-198 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), starting at +10° to match the pre-tilt of the lamella and then proceeding with 2° steps to roughly −50° and +70°. Individual tilts were recorded in movie mode with 10 frames per second, at an object pixel size of 3.52 Å and a target defocus of −4 to −5.5 μm. The total accumulated dose deposited on each tilt-series ranged from 90 to 140 e-/Å 2 .
Chlamydomonas VIPP1-mCherry cells were grown until mid-log phase in TAP media, shaking at 120 rpm with 40 μmol photons m −2 s −1 light. Vitrification was performed as described above for Synechocystis , except that cells were frozen onto R 1/2 carbon-foil 200-mesh copper EM grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools). Grids were clipped into FIB-compatible Autogrid support rings (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred into a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a Leica EM cryo-CLEM stage and transfer system (Leica Microsystems). Imaging was performed with an HC PL APO 50x/0.90 DRY objective in transmitted light and fluorescence modes using 552 nm laser excitation (OPS) at 0.6% intensity (corresponding to ∼0.033 mW) with a pinhole size of 0.90 and two detection channels: 610-633 nm for mCherry and 710-720 nm for chlorophyll autofluorescence. The field of view was adjusted to the size of individual grid squares for subsequent correlative targeting. To account for the Chlamydomonas cell size, ∼10 um z stacks with a z-spacing optimized for the pinhole were acquired at each selected position using LAS X software (Leica Microsystems). Z-stack images were deconvolved using Huygens Essential software (Scientific Volume Imaging). Cryo-FIB milling was performed as described above. Areas of interest were targeted based on the fiducial and landmark coordinates obtained from z stacks using the 3D Correlation Toolbox ( Arnold et al., 2016 1. Arnold, J. ∙ Mahamid, J. ∙ Lucic, V. ... Site-Specific Cryo-focused Ion Beam Sample Preparation Guided by 3D Correlative Microscopy Biophys. J. 2016; 110 :860-869 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Fiji software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 92. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (21352) PubMed Google Scholar ). After transferring grids to the Titan Krios, low-magnification overviews of the lamellae were acquired with tiled montages at 6500x magnification to enable precise targeting of the VIPP1-mCherry puncta for cryo-ET. Figure 6 shows examples of correlative overlays between the Leica confocal ( Figures 6 A and 6H) and Aquilos SEM overviews ( Figures 6 B and 6I), as well as correlation of the same fluorescence images with the Titan Krios TEM overviews ( Figures 6 C, 6D, 6J, and 6K). Tilt-series were acquired as described above.
The tilt-series were preprocessed and assembled with the STOPGAP TOMOMAN pipeline ( https://github.com/williamnwan/TOMOMAN/ ), including drift correction of raw frames with MotionCor2 software ( Zheng et al., 2017 118. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (1982) PubMed Google Scholar ) and dose-weighting of individual tilts. Using IMOD software ( Kremer et al., 1996 47. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (3066) PubMed Google Scholar ), the assembled tilt-series were aligned with patch tracking, and bin4 tomographic volumes (14.08 Å pixel size) were reconstructed by weighted back projection. To enhance contrast for display, we applied the tom_deconv deconvolution filter ( https://github.com/dtegunov/tom_deconv ) to the bin4 Synechocystis tomograms (with the exception of those in Figure S8 ) and the Cryo-CARE denoising filter ( Buchholz et al., 2018 9. Buchholz, T.-O. ∙ Jordan, M. ∙ Pigino, G. ... Cryo-CARE: Content-Aware Image Restoration for Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy Data arXiv. 2018; arXiv:1810.05420 https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05420 Google Scholar ) to the bin4 Chlamydomonas tomograms. Slices through tomogram volumes ( Figures 4 , 5 , 6 , S6 , S7 , and S8 ) were generated with the IMOD 3dmod viewer. Tomogram segmentation was performed in Amira software (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a combination of manual segmentation and automated membrane detection from the TomoSegMemTV software package ( Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2014 58. Martinez-Sanchez, A. ∙ Garcia, I. ∙ Asano, S. ... Robust membrane detection based on tensor voting for electron tomography J. Struct. Biol. 2014; 186 :49-61 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The single mutations we inserted into N-terminal H1 caused some syn VIPP1 proteins to assemble into rods instead of rings in vitro . We performed a grid-based measurement of negative-stain EM images to roughly estimate the percentage of VIPP1 protein incorporated within rings and rods for each of the mutants ( Figure S5 ). The dimensions of the negative-stain micrographs were 4096x4096 pixels, with a pixel size of 0.221 nm. Therefore, each micrograph was a square with a side length of 905 nm. Based on the dimensions of VIPP1 rings and rods (30-40 nm diameter), a grid spacing of 100 nm was chosen, yielding a grid map of 8x8 squares. The 8x8 grid map was overlaid on each of the images, and the presence of rings and/or rods in each square was manually counted. For both rings and rods, if more than ∼25% of a structure was contained within a grid square, that square was counted. Rods frequently extended through several squares, resulting in multiple counts for one structure. Thus, the goal of this analysis was not to measure the relative abundance of ring and rod structures, but rather to estimate the percentage of VIPP1 protein incorporated into the two types of structures. The cumulative results are shown in Figure 3 F. For each plotted bar in the graph, we analyzed 20-50 images from 2-3 grids, produced from 2-4 independent protein preps.
For thylakoid measurements ( Figure 4 L), 2D slices (zoomed 6x with interpolation) were generated from the bin4 tomographic volumes using the IMOD 3dmod viewer. The slices were oriented with the xy-plane perpendicular to the thylakoid membranes (i.e., the thylakoids were viewed in cross-section). Using Fiji software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 92. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (21352) PubMed Google Scholar ), line scan intensity profiles were generated with a 40 pixel-wide line (9.4 nm) drawn perpendicular to the thylakoid sheet. Lumen width was measured between the shoulders of the peaks corresponding to opposing lipid bilayers of each thylakoid (see Engel et al., 2015 19. Engel, B.D. ∙ Schaffer, M. ∙ Kuhn Cuellar, L. ... Native architecture of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast revealed by in situ cryo-electron tomography eLife. 2015; 4 :e04889 PubMed Google Scholar ). The measurement point on the peak shoulder was defined as the halfway point between the dark peak of the EM density and the adjacent light peak of the fringe caused by the contrast transfer function. Similarly, membrane thickness was estimated by measuring the width of the peak corresponding to each bilayer (from shoulder to shoulder). A total of 50 tomograms were reconstructed, from which 48 were used for the analysis (WT: 7 LL and 6 HL; F4E mutant: 12 LL and 9 HL; V11E mutant: 7 LL and 7 HL). A total of 283 thylakoid membrane regions were used to generate 346 line scans (WT: 37 scans on 26 LL thylakoids and 28 scans on 25 HL thylakoids; F4E: 87 scans on 71 LL thylakoids and 63 scans on 52 HL thylakoids; V11E: 63 scans on 51 LL thylakoids and 68 scans on 58 HL thylakoids). For each thylakoid, scans were performed at the widest region and not more than once per 500 nm of thylakoid length. Line scan intensity profiles of putative syn VIPP1 and syn VIPP1-GFP ( Figure S8 E) were generated in a similar manner, using 2D slices (zoomed 4x with interpolation) from bin4 tomograms and a 15 pixel-wide line (5.3 nm) drawn perpendicular to the wall of the structure. For both WT syn VIPP1 (gray in Figure S8 E) and syn VIPP1-GFP (green in Figure S8 E), 15 individual line scans were aligned with each other using the middle peak, which corresponds to putative VIPP1. This caused the averages of the membrane bilayer and putative GFP peak to be slightly broader due to variable positioning of these peaks relative to the central VIPP1 peak.
