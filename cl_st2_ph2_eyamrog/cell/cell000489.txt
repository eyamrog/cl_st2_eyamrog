Title: Pan-ebolavirus protective therapy by two multifunctional human antibodies


Abstract: Summary

Ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal illness with the potential for global spread. Monoclonal antibody-based treatments that have become available recently have a narrow therapeutic spectrum and are ineffective against ebolaviruses other than Ebola virus (EBOV), including medically important Bundibugyo (BDBV) and Sudan (SUDV) viruses. Here, we report the development of a therapeutic cocktail comprising two broadly neutralizing human antibodies, rEBOV-515 and rEBOV-442, that recognize non-overlapping sites on the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP). Antibodies in the cocktail exhibited synergistic neutralizing activity, resisted viral escape, and possessed differing requirements for their Fc-regions for optimal in vivo activities. The cocktail protected non-human primates from ebolavirus disease caused by EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV with high therapeutic effectiveness. High-resolution structures of the cocktail antibodies in complex with GP revealed the molecular determinants for neutralization breadth and potency. This study provides advanced preclinical data to support clinical development of this cocktail for pan-ebolavirus therapy.

Section: Introduction

The genus Ebolavirus consists of six antigenically distinct species, including Zaire ebolavirus (represented by Ebola virus [EBOV]), Sudan ebolavirus (Sudan virus [SUDV]), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bundibugyo virus [BDBV]), Taï Forest ebolavirus (Taï Forest virus [TAFV]), Reston ebolavirus (Reston virus [RESV]) ( Feldmann et al., 2020 21.

Three ebolaviruses—EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV—are responsible for severe disease and occasional deadly outbreaks in Africa posing a significant health threat and highlighting the urgent need for development of medical countermeasures. A total of 19 confirmed ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreaks caused by EBOV have occurred, with >30,000 people infected to date and an average reported mortality rate of ∼70% ( World Health Organization, 2021 81. World Health Organization Ebola virus disease https://www.whoint/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease Date: 2021 Google Scholar ). In 2021, there are ongoing EVD outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea ( World Health Organization, 2021 81. World Health Organization Ebola virus disease https://www.whoint/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease Date: 2021 Google Scholar ). BDBV has caused two confirmed outbreaks and infected 206 people (∼32% mortality rate), and SUDV has been responsible for eight confirmed outbreaks and infected 779 people (∼53% mortality rate) ( World Health Organization, 2021 81. World Health Organization Ebola virus disease https://www.whoint/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease Date: 2021 Google Scholar ). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies have demonstrated safe and significant survival benefits in the treatment of acute EVD caused by EBOV in human trials ( Gaudinski et al., 2019 28.

USA. 2020; 117 :3768-3778 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). By 2020, two mAb-based therapeutics—ansuvimab-zykl (Ebanga) and atoltivimab + maftivimab + odesivimab-ebgn (Inmazeb)—have been developed and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use ( Food and Drug Administration, 2020a 24. Food and Drug Administration FDA Approves First Treatment for Ebola Virus 2020 https://www.fdagov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-ebola-virus Google Scholar , 2020b 25. Food and Drug Administration FDA Approves Treatment for Ebola Virus 2020 https://www.fdagov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-approves-treatment-ebola-virus Google Scholar ). Both of these approved mAb treatments are monospecific to EBOV and therefore not indicated for treatment of BDBV or SUDV infection. Identification of mAbs that cross-neutralize EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV with high potency is challenging due to the relatively high antigenic variability between these viruses ( King et al., 2019 46. King, L.B. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ∙ West, B.R. ... Achieving cross-reactivity with pan-ebolavirus antibodies Curr. Opin. Virol. 2019; 34 :140-148 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). The efficacy of previously reported investigational mAb therapeutics typically is limited to only one of the three medically important ebolavirus species. The nature of future ebolavirus outbreaks cannot be predicted, however, and in a scenario of global spread, viruses can mutate rapidly making available mAb treatments vulnerable to escape, as has been recently shown for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ( Starr et al., 2021 71. Starr, T.N. ∙ Greaney, A.J. ∙ Dingens, A.S. ... Complete map of SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations that escape the monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555 and its cocktail with LY-CoV016 Cell Rep.

Antibody resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 Nature. 2021; 593 :130-135 Crossref Scopus (1494) PubMed Google Scholar ). One approach could be to develop separate therapeutic mAb products for BDBV or SUDV or future escape variants of EBOV. It is desirable from a practical standpoint, however, to identify a single broad therapeutic spectrum mAb treatment of an equivalent or higher potency to existing monospecific mAb treatments that could be used for treatment of EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV. Therefore, ongoing efforts are needed to increase the therapeutic breadth of mAb therapies while maintaining or improving efficacy.
The ebolavirus envelope glycoprotein (GP) is the key target for neutralizing mAbs ( King et al., 2018 43. King, L.B. ∙ West, B.R. ∙ Schendel, S.L. ...

Immunotherapeutic strategies to target vulnerabilities in the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2021; 54 :412-436 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously described isolation of two broadly neutralizing human mAbs, EBOV-515 and EBOV-442, using a human B cell hybridoma approach ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each of these two mAbs exhibited favorable immunological profiles, which included (1) broad reactivity for binding to GP of diverse species, (2) broad neutralization of authentic ebolaviruses (EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV), (3) recognition of distinct, non-overlapping epitopes in the GP (EBOV-515 is base-specific and EBOV-442 is glycan-cap-specific), and (4) a high level of therapeutic protection against EBOV. The antibodies EBOV-515 or EBOV-442 are analogous to the broadly reactive mAb EBOV-520 (GP-base-specific mAb) or mAb EBOV-548 (glycan-cap-specific), respectively ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recently described a beneficial feature of the combination of EBOV-520 + EBOV-548 by showing that these two mAbs synergized for virus neutralization when combined in a cocktail and conferred therapeutic protection in EBOV-challenged rhesus macaques ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not previously characterize the similar combination of EBOV-515 + EBOV-442. However, our previous studies revealed that the individual mAbs, EBOV-515 and EBOV-442, had a higher potency to neutralize the most antigenically distinct of the three viruses (SUDV) when compared, respectively, to the potency of EBOV-520 or EBOV-548. EBOV-515 monotherapy in mice also demonstrated a high level of therapeutic protection against SUDV ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the higher potency of EBOV-515 and EBOV-442 against SUDV, we suggest their combination as a candidate for a “next-generation” broad therapeutic mAb cocktail. In this study, we describe pre-clinical development of the EBOV-515 + EBOV-442 mAb cocktail and define the molecular basis for its pan-ebolavirus activity and efficacy.

Section: Results

Antibody variable gene sequences for mAbs EBOV-515 and EBOV-442 were determined, and synthetic DNAs encoding the mAbs were used to produce recombinant IgG1. Recombinant (r) mAbs, designated as rEBOV-515 and rEBOV-442, potently neutralized EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV ( Figure 1 A) with a note that rEBOV-442 only partially neutralized SUDV (Gulu variant) but was more active against a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the Boniface variant of SUDV GP (see below). To assess the Fc-mediated effector function of these antibodies to mediate killing of antigen-expressing cells, we used a stably transfected EBOV GP-expressing SNAP-tagged 293F cell line as a target, with heterologous human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as source of effector cells and a previously described assay ( Domi et al., 2018 19. Domi, A. ∙ Feldmann, F. ∙ Basu, R. ... A single dose of modified Vaccinia Ankara expressing Ebola virus like particles protects nonhuman primates from lethal Ebola virus challenge Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :864 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). The glycan-cap-specific mAb rEBOV-442 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) exhibited a high level of cytotoxic activity, and the GP-base-specific mAb rEBOV-515 exhibited a moderate level of cytotoxic activity, relative to the control Fc-function-disabled IgG1-LALA-PG variant of rEBOV-515 (designated as rEBOV-515 LALA-PG) or an irrelevant mAb rDENV 2D22 (IgG1 isotype) specific to the dengue virus envelope (E) protein ( Fibriansah et al., 2015 22. Fibriansah, G. ∙ Ibarra, K.D. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... DENGUE VIRUS. Cryo-EM structure of an antibody that neutralizes dengue virus type 2 by locking E protein dimers Science. 2015; 349 :88-91 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 B). Neutralizing activity of the wild-type IgG1 and IgG1-LALA-PG variants of rEBOV-515 was equivalent ( Figure S1 A). These results taken together revealed two complementary activities exhibited by this broad mAb cocktail, specifically the Fc-mediated effector functions mediated by rEBOV-442 and the potent neutralizing activities mediated by rEBOV-442 and rEBOV-515 ( Figure 1 C).
One benefit of using a cocktail of two or more neutralizing mAbs that bind to non-overlapping regions of the viral antigen is to reduce the risk of viral escape from neutralization that is inherent in monotherapy approaches ( Baum et al., 2020 3. Baum, A. ∙ Fulton, B.O. ∙ Wloga, E. ...

Antigenic variation in three distinct determinants of an influenza type A haemagglutinin molecule Nature. 1979; 279 :246-248 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). To demonstrate this feature for this cocktail directly, we next used a recombinant infectious VSV expressing EBOV or BDBV GP in place of the endogenous VSV glycoprotein (VSV/EBOV GP or VSV/BDBV GP) to select for GP mutations that escape mAb neutralization. We used rEBOV-442, rEBOV-515, or 1:1 mixture of both mAbs and a high-throughput quantitative real-time cellular analysis assay (RTCA) to select viral variants that can escape neutralization ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34.

For comparative purposes, we also assessed the broadly reactive antibodies ADI-15878 and ADI-15946 that form the basis for a potent broadly protective investigational cocktail ( Bornholdt et al., 2019 7. Bornholdt, Z.A. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ∙ Mire, C.E. ...

Antibodies from a human survivor define sites of vulnerability for broad protection against ebolaviruses Cell. 2017; 169 :878-890.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used recombinant IgG1 proteins for these antibodies that we produced using publicly available mAb variable region sequences. ADI-15946, similarly to rEBOV-515, recognizes the loop region of the internal fusion loop (IFL), whereas ADI-15878 recognizes the stem region of the IFL ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; King et al., 2019 46. King, L.B. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ∙ West, B.R. ... Achieving cross-reactivity with pan-ebolavirus antibodies Curr. Opin. Virol. 2019; 34 :140-148 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, hence, the ADI-15878 binding site does not overlap with that of the other IFL-specific mAbs we tested. We selected for escape at a single saturating mAb concentration of 20 μg/mL using ∼1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) and performing 60–154 replicates for each sample ( Figure S1 B). Only one to two passages with individual mAbs rEBOV-442, ADI-15878, or ADI-15946 led to selection of variants resistant to neutralization by 20 μg/mL of mAb used for the escape selection. For rEBOV-515 or the rEBOV-442 + rEBOV-515 cocktail, escape variants were not detected in any of the 154 or 60 replicate experiments and after two passages ( Figure 1 D), suggesting a lower likelihood of in vitro escape for rEBOV-515 or the cocktail. Viruses that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-442 were fully neutralized by rEBOV-515 or a mixture of rEBOV-442 and rEBOV-515 ( Figures 1 D and S1 C), showing that the cocktail retains neutralization potency even if rEBOV-442 is impacted. Importantly, the viruses selected to be resistant to neutralization by each single mAb rEBOV-442, ADI-15878, or ADI-15946 were sensitive to neutralization by each of three other mAbs, highlighting the differences for these mAbs in their binding site residues ( Figures 1 D and S1 C). We sequenced the viral gene encoding the GP of selected escape viruses and identified distinct point mutations ( Figure 1 D), including several previously identified escape mutations at amino acid positions L273 for rEBOV-442 ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), K510 for ADI-15946, and G528 for ADI-15878 ( Wec et al., 2017 78. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ∙ Murin, C.D. ... Antibodies from a human survivor define sites of vulnerability for broad protection against ebolaviruses Cell. 2017; 169 :878-890.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). In all cases, escape viruses carried GP mutations in the binding site of the respective mAb ( Figure S1 D). Together, these results demonstrated a high resistance to viral escape for the cocktail of the rEBOV-442 + rEBOV-515, which acts by both neutralizing and Fc-mediated activities.
To define the contribution of Fc-mediated effector functions to protection in vivo , each mAb of the candidate therapeutic cocktail was assessed as an IgG1 protein (the original subclass of mAb secreted by the hybridoma cell line and a functionally competent form of mAb) and as an IgG1 LALA-PG protein that is disabled for Fc function. The Fc region of the LALA-PG variant has three mutations, L234A, L235A, and P329G, which eliminate complement binding and Fc-γ-receptor-dependent, antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity in both murine IgG2a and human IgG1 ( Lo et al., 2017 55. Lo, M. ∙ Kim, H.S. ∙ Tong, R.K. ... Effector-attenuating substitutions that maintain antibody stability and reduce toxicity in mice J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :3900-3908 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ). We challenged groups of mice with mouse-adapted EBOV (EBOV-MA) on day 0 and administered mAbs 1 day later. We chose different treatment doses of rEBOV-515 (1 mg/kg) and rEBOV-442 (5 mg/kg) based on the known in vivo potency of the parental hybridoma-produced mAbs EBOV-442 (moderate potency at 5 mg/kg) and EBOV-515 (high potency at 5 mg/kg) ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previously we have shown that for low-dose treatment (1 mg/kg), the Fc-disabled LALA variant of the GP base-specific mAb EBOV-520 (that is analogous to rEBOV-515 based on competition binding) offered a higher level of therapeutic protection in mice against EBOV (60% survival) when compared to that mediated by the wild-type (WT) IgG1 EBOV-520 (0% survival) ( Kuzmina et al., 2018 49. Kuzmina, N.A. ∙ Younan, P. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ... Antibody-dependent enhancement of Ebola virus infection by human antibodies isolated from survivors Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :1802-1815 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the full protection from weight loss and disease conferred by the 5 mg/kg dose of hybridoma-expressed EBOV-515 ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), and to compare with the reported potency for low-dose EBOV-520 treatment, in this study, we tested the recombinant variants of rEBOV-515 using a 1 mg/kg low-dose treatment. For comparative purposes, we also assessed the broadly reactive mAbs ADI-15946 (1 mg/kg; analogous to rEBOV-515) and ADI-15878 (5 mg/kg; recognizing a distinct epitope on IFL) ( Wec et al., 2017 78. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ∙ Murin, C.D. ... Antibodies from a human survivor define sites of vulnerability for broad protection against ebolaviruses Cell. 2017; 169 :878-890.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ) as IgG1 proteins. The rEBOV-515 LALA-PG variant offered complete protection (100% survival) against EBOV challenge in mice at a 1 mg/kg therapeutic dose, whereas the WT IgG1 variant showed partial protection (80% survival) ( Figure 2 ). ADI-15946 IgG1 did not protect at 1 mg/kg. This finding demonstrated a higher in vivo potency of the broad GP base-specific mAb rEBOV-515 when compared to the previously reported effect of the broad GP base-specific mAb rEBOV-520 or ADI-15946 IgG1, and suggested that rEBOV-515 LALA-PG is a preferable Fc variant for the cocktail of two Fc variants tested.
Similarly, we compared the in vivo potency of WT IgG1 rEBOV-442 and rEBOV-442 LALA-PG, which were administered at a 5 mg/kg dose 1 day after EBOV challenge ( Figure 2 ). Cytotoxicity assay results ( Figure 1 B) suggested that the glycan cap mAb rEBOV-442, in addition to possessing neutralizing activity, also exhibited substantial Fc effector function-mediated activity. In agreement with this finding, the results of our in vivo study showed a transient improvement in weight (i.e., reduced loss) on 2–4 and 8–10 days post-infection with WT rEBOV-442 IgG1, which was associated with improved protection from death (90% survival in the WT mAb-treated group when compared to 70% in the rEBOV-442 LALA-PG-treated group) and faster recovery from illness ( Figure 2 ). ADI-15878 IgG1 at 5 mg/kg fully protected mice against EBOV. Together, these data revealed differing requirements for the Fc regions of rEBOV-442 and rEBOV-515, demonstrated a high in vivo potency of the mAbs tested, and justified the inclusion of rEBOV-515 as a LALA-PG and rEBOV-442 as a WT IgG1 in a new broad and protective ebolavirus two-antibody cocktail.
Antibodies in a cocktail directed to a common viral protein may recognize antigen in a synergistic, additive, or antagonistic manner. We first characterized the effect mediated by the mixture of two mAbs on ebolavirus GP binding. Serially diluted Alexa Fluor-647-labeled mAb rEBOV-442 IgG1 or rEBOV-515 LALA-PG was titrated into serially diluted unlabeled partner mAb to generate two pairwise combinatorial matrices of two mAbs in the mixture ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Binding of the Alexa Fluor-647-labeled mAb from each combination was assessed by flow cytometric analysis using a Jurkat cell line that was stably transduced to display EBOV GP on the surface as described before ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). The values were calculated as the percent of the relative fluorescence signal caused by the highest concentration of respective fluorescently labeled mAb alone ( Figures S2 A and S2B), and then compared with the expected responses calculated using the ZIP synergy-scoring model ( Ianevski et al., 2020 39. Ianevski, A. ∙ Giri, A.K. ∙ Aittokallio, T. SynergyFinder 2.0: visual analytics of multi-drug combination synergies Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :W488-W493 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). The synergy score can be interpreted as the average excess response (percent change) for the mAb combination ( Ianevski et al., 2020 39. Ianevski, A. ∙ Giri, A.K. ∙ Aittokallio, T. SynergyFinder 2.0: visual analytics of multi-drug combination synergies Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :W488-W493 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). The comparison revealed that the combination of mAbs rEBOV-442 and rEBOV-515 was synergistic, and each mAb reciprocally enhanced binding of the partner mAb in the mixture ( Figures S2 B and S2C). This finding contrasted with the unidirectional GP binding synergy observed in the cocktail of the other broad mAbs rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 (Gilchuk et al., 2020b). Binding enhancement increased steadily with increasing of mAb concentration, indicating more contribution from synergy at higher concentrations of individual mAbs in the cocktail ( Figures S2 B and S2C).
We next characterized the effect by the mixture of two mAbs on ebolavirus neutralization. Using a recently developed RTCA assay and infectious chimeric VSV/ebolavirus GP viruses ( Gilchuk et al., 2020a 33. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Bombardi, R.G. ∙ Erasmus, J.H. ... Integrated pipeline for the accelerated discovery of antiviral antibody therapeutics Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2020; 4 :1030-1043 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), we showed dose-dependent neutralization of VSV/EBOV GP, VSV/BDBV GP, or VSV/SUDV GP viruses by the 1:1 mAb mixture ( Figure 3 A). Then, we titrated serially diluted rEBOV-442 into serially diluted rEBOV-515 to generate a pairwise combinatorial matrix of two mAbs in the mixture and assessed each combination for neutralization of VSV/EBOV GP, VSV/BDBV GP, or VSV/SUDV GP viruses ( Figure 3 B). Synergy analysis identified areas in the neutralization matrix (showing mAb ratios) with the most profound combination effect and suggested broad synergistic activity in the cocktail of rEBOV-442 and rEBOV-515 ( Figure 3 C). Synergistic activity mediated by the cocktail also was confirmed using neutralization assays with authentic live ebolaviruses, and more prominent synergy of neutralization was identified for SUDV ( Figure S3 ).
Next, we tested the efficacy of the cocktail of rEBOV-515 LALA-PG + rEBOV-442 IgG1 in nonhuman primate (NHP) challenge models for each of the three ebolaviruses, EBOV (Kikwit variant), BDBV (Uganda variant), and SUDV (Gulu variant). We chose a 2:1 mAb ratio in the cocktail (66.5% rEBOV-515 LALA-PG and 33.5% rEBOV-442 IgG1 in the mixture) empirically. We biased the composition using a higher proportion of rEBOV-515 LALA-PG based on several principles: (1) higher neutralizing potency of rEBOV-515 against SUDV, (2) higher protective efficacy of rEBOV-515 in vivo , and (3) higher resistance against mutational escape in the presence of rEBOV-515 in vitro when compared to that of rEBOV-442. Of note, at this ratio, the mAbs exhibited synergy in the cocktail to neutralize the virus as determined from the synergy distribution maps ( Figures 3 and S3 ). We used rhesus macaque EBOV and SUDV lethal challenge models and a cynomolgus monkey BDBV lethal challenge model, which recapitulate many key features of EVD in humans ( Bennett et al., 2017 4. Bennett, R.S. ∙ Huzella, L.M. ∙ Jahrling, P.B. ... Nonhuman primate models of Ebola virus disease Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2017; 411 :171-193 PubMed Google Scholar ; Geisbert et al., 2015 30. Geisbert, T.W. ∙ Strong, J.E. ∙ Feldmann, H. Considerations in the use of nonhuman primate models of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection J. Infect. Dis. 2015; 212 :S91-S97 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Animals were assigned to three treatment groups of five animals per group. After intramuscular challenge with a lethal target dose of 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV, all NHPs of the treatment group received intravenously two 30 mg/kg doses of the cocktail spaced 3 days apart (given days 3 and 6 after EBOV, days 6 and 9 after BDBV, or days 4 and 7 after SUDV inoculation). For each challenge cohort, an additional animal was studied as a contemporaneous control and was left untreated. The untreated control animals developed a high clinical score and succumbed to disease on day 6, 14, or 10 after viral challenge with EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV, respectively. The two-dose therapeutic cocktail treatment provided complete pan-ebolavirus protection of NHPs from mortality and clinical signs of EVD ( Figures 4 A and 4B). We next assessed changes in blood chemistries and blood cell composition that are typically associated with EVD to further characterize the efficacy of the mAb treatment ( Tables S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , S5 , and S6 ). The liver enzymes alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), which are indicators of EVD ( Qiu et al., 2014 67. Qiu, X. ∙ Wong, G. ∙ Audet, J. ... Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp Nature. 2014; 514 :47-53 Crossref Scopus (827) PubMed Google Scholar ), were elevated in untreated NHPs at the peak of the disease ( Figure 4 C). Treated animals did not show signs of acute liver injury after the treatment, displaying low amounts of ALP, GGT, creatinine (CRE), and the other blood chemistries when compared with those of untreated NHP ( Figure 4 C; Tables S4 , S5 , and S6 ).
At the time of first treatment with the cocktail (day 3 after EBOV, day 6 after BDBV, or day 4 after SUDV inoculation), 14 NHPs from the treatment-designated group (all except one animal in EBOV-challenged group) and the control untreated NHPs were viremic and non-symptomatic, with virus titers that ranged from 5.1 to 10.6 log 10 genome equivalents (GEQs) per mL of plasma, as measured by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) ( Figure 5 A). A plaque assay that detects infectious virus revealed viremia in all 18 animals, with viral titers ranging from 0.7 to 7.4 log 10 PFUs per mL of plasma at the time of first treatment with the cocktail ( Figure 5 B). This finding confirmed active ebolavirus infection in all NHPs before treatment. At the time of the second mAb treatment (day 6 after EBOV, days 9 after BDBV, or day 7 after SUDV inoculation), each untreated control NHP from a respective EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV challenge cohort developed high viremia >8 log 10 GEQ/mL and >5 log 10 PFU/mL ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Concordant with full protection from disease and death, none of the 15 treated NHPs had detectable infectious virus in the plasma at that time (limit of detection [LOD] = 5 PFU/mL), and viral genomes were not detected in 12 of those NHPs 3.7 (LOD = log 10 GEQ/mL) at that time ( Figures 4 and 5 ). The three remaining NHPs that were from the BDBV inoculation cohort and that showed slightly delayed clearance of viral genomes in plasma no longer had detectable virus by day 15 after viral challenge. Analysis of various tissues harvested at study endpoint from treated animals (day 28 after inoculation with EBOV and SUDV or day 35 after inoculation with BDBV) and untreated animals (day 6, 14, or 10 after inoculation with EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV, respectively) revealed varying levels of viral RNA as a sign of systemic infection that had been established before the treatment ( Figure 5 C). It has been shown previously that in the case of treatment failure, the infectious virus can be readily detected by plaque assay ( Oswald et al., 2007 63. Oswald, W.B. ∙ Geisbert, T.W. ∙ Davis, K.J. ... Neutralizing antibody fails to impact the course of Ebola virus infection in monkeys PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3 :e9 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we next assessed the infectious virus load in 11 representative immune-privileged tissues of treated NHPs from each cohort that was selected based on the highest viral RNA load. Infectious virus was not detected in any of these tissues ( Figure 5 D), confirming virologic protection mediated by the cocktail treatment.
Together, these results showed a high therapeutic efficacy of the cocktail of rEBOV-515 LALA-PG + rEBOV-442 IgG1 to treat established viremia, clear the infectious virus from immune-privileged tissues, and prevent disease caused by EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV.
We previously reported the molecular determinants of the GP binding for several glycan cap-specific mAbs, including the broad mAb rEBOV-442 ( Murin et al., 2021 61. Murin, C.D. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Convergence of a common solution for broad ebolavirus neutralization by glycan cap-directed human antibodies Cell Rep. 2021; 35 :108984 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), and defined the structural basis of synergy for the pair of broad mAbs rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this new study, we focused on studies of the determinants of rEBOV-515 binding to elucidate the structural basis for the neutralization breadth and efficacy mediated by pan-ebolavirus cocktail of rEBOV-515 + rEBOV-442. We generated a complex of both rEBOV-515 and rEBOV-442 Fab with mucin-like domain-deleted EBOV GP from the Makona variant (EBOV GPΔMuc/Mak) and solved structures by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) ( Figures 6 A and S4 ; Table S7 ).
The interface between GP and rEBOV-515 in this structure was resolved to ∼3 to 3.5 Å resolution ( Figure S4 ), allowing for confident modeling of most of the side-chain residues. rEBOV-515 binds to the base of the IFL, directly below the glycan cap in GP1 ( Figure 6 A). There is significant overlap of the rEBOV-515 epitope with that of rEBOV-520, but rEBOV-515 has more extensive contacts in GP2 and less in GP1 ( Figure 6 B). Most EBOV-515 contacts are mediated by the heavy chain (HC), with all three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) contributing to binding the base of the IFL as well as a portion of GP1 near the 3 10 pocket ( Figures 6 C, S5 A, S5B, and S6 ). The CDRH3 contributes the most extensive contacts, including those that displace the descending β17-β18 loop of the glycan cap, making contacts near the 3 10 pocket, as well as a strong cation-pi bond with R136 GP1 ( Figure 6 C). The rEBOV-515 light chain (LC) also makes contacts with all three CDRs exclusively within GP2 ( Figures 6 D and S5 A). Together, this analysis showed that rEBOV-515 forms a strong interaction of complementary hydrophobic ( Figure S5 B) and electrostatic ( Figure S5 C) surfaces for binding to this epitope within GP.
Neutralizing potency may depend on the ability of mAb to remain bound to viral GP within the acidic environment of late endosomes, which is where pH-dependent cleavage occurs to expose the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) receptor binding site ( Carette et al., 2011 10. Carette, J.E. ∙ Raaben, M. ∙ Wong, A.C. ... Ebola virus entry requires the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 Nature. 2011; 477 :340-343 Crossref Scopus (1007) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chandran et al., 2005 11. Chandran, K. ∙ Sullivan, N.J. ∙ Felbor, U. ... Endosomal proteolysis of the Ebola virus glycoprotein is necessary for infection Science. 2005; 308 :1643-1645 Crossref Scopus (709) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that rEBOV-515 strongly interacts with the EBOV GP, we assessed binding of this mAb at varying pH to recombinant EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV GPs. We used the broadly reactive base-specific mAb rEBOV-520 for comparison. rEBOV-515 and rEBOV-520 bound equivalently to the GP of each of the three ebolaviruses at neutral pH 7.4, and rEBOV-515 remained bound at acidic pH of 5.5 or 4.5, whereas rEBOV-520 lost binding activity ( Figure S7 A).
The rEBOV-515 binding site partially overlaps with those of other reported broad mAbs that bind to the 3 10 pocket, including rEBOV-520 ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ADI-15946 ( West et al., 2019 80. West, B.R. ∙ Wec, A.Z. ∙ Moyer, C.L. ... Structural basis of broad ebolavirus neutralization by a human survivor antibody Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :204-212 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 6 B and 6E). Each of these mAbs relies upon E106 and R136 in GP1 and several residues at the base of the IFL, using long CDRH3 loops that mimic and replace the β17-β18 loop of the GP1 in apo-GP structure ( Figure 6 E). However, characterization of the rEBOV-515 binding site revealed several unique features. rEBOV-515 uses a single CDR loop to simultaneously mimic and displace the β17-β18 loop and to bind to R136 in GP1. This feature allows rEBOV-515 to access a region that is occupied by a glycerol cryoprotectant molecule in the unliganded crystal structure of GP (PDB: 5JQ3 and 5JQB ) that we defined as “glycerol pocket” ( Figure 6 E). In addition, this mechanism facilitates greater interaction of EBOV-515 with the cleavage loop compared to that caused by rEBOV-520, which may explain the high cell surface-displayed GP cleavage-inhibiting activity of EBOV-515 ( Figure S7 B). Further, a distinct pose of rEBOV-515 binding into the 3 10 pocket avoids clashes with the α2 helix of the glycan cap ( Figure 6 F), unlike the binding of rEBOV-520 to the GP, which requires the α2 helix shift ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). This finding suggested that the binding site of rEBOV-515 on the intact GP molecule is more accessible than the rEBOV-520 binding site, which could explain the higher neutralizing potency of rEBOV-515 when compared to the potency of rEBOV-520 against the virus carrying the intact GP as we reported previously ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, we have shown previously that GP cleavage, which removes the glycan cap along with the β17-β18 loop, resulted in enhanced binding to cell-surface-displayed cleaved GP and increased neutralizing potency for both rEBOV-515 and rEBOV-520 ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020b 34.

Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ).
There are notable differences in degree of pan-ebolavirus neutralization and protection by each of three reported broadly reactive human mAbs despite recognition of partially overlapped epitopes they recognize on the GP base ( Figure 6 B). ADI-15946 did not fully neutralize most antigenically distinct SUDV ( Wec et al., 2017 78. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ∙ Murin, C.D. ... Antibodies from a human survivor define sites of vulnerability for broad protection against ebolaviruses Cell. 2017; 169 :878-890.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; West et al., 2019 80. West, B.R. ∙ Wec, A.Z. ∙ Moyer, C.L. ... Structural basis of broad ebolavirus neutralization by a human survivor antibody Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :204-212 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), rEBOV-520 neutralized SUDV with modest potency but showed weak protection against SUDV in mice, and rEBOV-515 potently neutralized each of three viruses and protected against SUDV in mice ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structural analysis allowed us to compare the epitope footprint and contacts for each of these antibodies in relation to sequence conservation between the three major ebolavirus ( Figures 7 and S6 ), providing insight that may help explain differences in neutralization breadth. ADI-15946 makes fewer contacts with GP1 but more contacts to the N terminus of GP2, a region that is less conserved that may explain weak SUDV neutralization. Conversely, rEBOV-520 makes more extensive contacts with GP1, because this region is generally less conserved. rEBOV-515 relies on minimal contacts with GP1, except in regions that are completely conserved, including R136 and E106. Taken together with a more conserved footprint, these observations provide a molecular basis for the superior breadth of neutralization and protection exhibited by rEBOV-515 over similar mAbs.

Section: Discussion

Here, we report comprehensive studies of pan-ebolavirus mAb cocktail treatment with a well-defined and complex molecular basis of broad neutralization and potency. The cocktail exhibited high therapeutic efficacy against all three medically important ebolaviruses in nonhuman primates. The discovery and recent approval of human mAb-based therapeutics represents a landmark achievement in the development of EVD medical countermeasures. The clinical trials in the DRC outbreak, however, highlighted that substantial gaps remained in improving the treatment of acute EVD ( Iversen et al., 2020 41. Iversen, P.L. ∙ Kane, C.D. ∙ Zeng, X. ... Recent successes in therapeutics for Ebola virus disease: no time for complacency Lancet Infect. Dis. 2020; 20 :e231-e237 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). The greatest benefit of mAb treatment in patients was mainly in those receiving early therapy, and only moderate benefit was observed in severely ill patients ( Levine, 2019 53. Levine, M.M. Monoclonal antibody therapy for Ebola virus disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2019; 381 :2365-2366 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another remaining challenge for implementation of the current regimens is the logistical complexity of intravenous drug administration in the field, which may limit widespread application of mAb therapy in future outbreak scenarios.
Given the difference in efficacy mediated by different mAb drugs that was observed for advanced EVD treatments, mAb potency likely is a key contributing determinant of treatment efficacy. Inmazeb and Ebanga demonstrated higher efficacy when compared to that of the mAb cocktail ZMapp in clinical trials ( Levine, 2019 53. Levine, M.M. Monoclonal antibody therapy for Ebola virus disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2019; 381 :2365-2366 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inmazeb is a three-antibody cocktail based on REGN-EB3 mAb sequences ( Pascal et al., 2018 64. Pascal, K.E. ∙ Dudgeon, D. ∙ Trefry, J.C. ... Development of clinical-stage human monoclonal antibodies that treat advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates J. Infect. Dis. 2018; 218 :S612-S626 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), Ebanga is a monotherapy based on the antibody mAb114 ( Corti et al., 2016 14. Corti, D. ∙ Misasi, J. ∙ Mulangu, S. ... Protective monotherapy against lethal Ebola virus infection by a potently neutralizing antibody Science. 2016; 351 :1339-1342 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ZMapp is a cocktail of three murine-human chimeric mAbs ( Qiu et al., 2014 67. Qiu, X. ∙ Wong, G. ∙ Audet, J. ... Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp Nature. 2014; 514 :47-53 Crossref Scopus (827) PubMed Google Scholar ). A comparison with the historical NHPs studies with REGN-EB3 (3 × 50 mg/kg dose at days 5, 8, and 11 after exposure) ( Pascal et al., 2018 64. Pascal, K.E. ∙ Dudgeon, D. ∙ Trefry, J.C. ... Development of clinical-stage human monoclonal antibodies that treat advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates J. Infect. Dis. 2018; 218 :S612-S626 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), mAb114 (3 × 50 mg/kg dose at days 1, 2, and 3 after exposure) ( Corti et al., 2016 14. Corti, D. ∙ Misasi, J. ∙ Mulangu, S. ... Protective monotherapy against lethal Ebola virus infection by a potently neutralizing antibody Science. 2016; 351 :1339-1342 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ZMapp (3 × 50 mg/kg dose at days 3, 6, and 9 after exposure) ( Qiu et al., 2014 67. Qiu, X. ∙ Wong, G. ∙ Audet, J. ... Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp Nature. 2014; 514 :47-53 Crossref Scopus (827) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggested equivalent or likely higher potency of our EBOV-442 IgG1 + EBOV-515 LALA-PG cocktail treatment (2 × 30 mg/kg at days 3 and 6 after exposure) against homologous EBOV. More studies are needed to compare available treatments and to determine if increasing mAb therapeutic potency would benefit clinical outcomes in treatment of severely ill patients and/or allow for rapid and more practical treatment by an alternative (intramuscular or subcutaneous) route of mAb delivery.

One of the most well-characterized broadly neutralizing mAbs is the macaque mAb CA45 that also demonstrated broad protection in animals ( Zhao et al., 2017 84. Zhao, X. ∙ Howell, K.A. ∙ He, S. ... Immunization-elicited broadly protective antibody reveals ebolavirus fusion loop as a site of vulnerability Cell. 2017; 169 :891-904.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Anticipation of future EVD outbreaks requires consideration of therapeutic breadth, and mAbs of human origin are most suitable for the development of human therapeutics. As an added feature, the two-antibody cocktail we describe here offered an increased therapeutic breadth that extended to protection against BDBV and SUDV in NHP models. One other investigational human mAb cocktail that demonstrated broad efficacy in NHPs, MBP134 AF , has been described ( Bornholdt et al., 2019 7. Bornholdt, Z.A. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ∙ Mire, C.E. ... A two-antibody pan-ebolavirus cocktail confers broad therapeutic protection in ferrets and nonhuman primates Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :49-58.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). MBP134 AF is comprised of mAb ADI-15878 and a derivative of mAb ADI-15946 (defined as ADI-23774), which was engineered to improve its specificity against SUDV GP ( Wec et al., 2019 79. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Bornholdt, Z.A. ∙ He, S. ... Development of a human antibody cocktail that deploys multiple functions to confer pan-ebolavirus protection Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :39-48.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). A comparison of our results to the reported activities of ADI-15946 or ADI-23774 ( Wec et al., 2017 78. Wec, A.Z. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ∙ Murin, C.D. ... Antibodies from a human survivor define sites of vulnerability for broad protection against ebolaviruses Cell. 2017; 169 :878-890.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicates a high potency for the homologous base-specific mAb rEBOV-515 that we describe. In agreement with this functional assessment, our structural data showed that rEBOV-515 strongly interacts with conserved residues in the GP, with a unique footprint among base-specific broadly reactive human mAbs rEBOV-515, rEBOV-520, and ADI-15946, suggesting a structural basis for its remarkable breadth and potency. In addition, the analysis revealed features that are essential for synergistic and efficient GP binding in the cocktail of rEBOV-515 + rEBOV-442 but distinct from those in the cocktail of rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 we previously described. First, there is a reciprocal enhancement of the GP binding in the cocktail of rEBOV-515 + rEBOV-442. Second, binding to the GP occurs without major structural remodeling of the GP1 while displacing the β17-β18 loop from the binding site of rEBOV-515. Together, this suggests a mechanism for high neutralization potency in the cocktail.
Multifunctionality is another desirable feature in mAb cocktails in addition to neutralizing potency and breadth ( Saphire et al., 2018 69. Saphire, E.O. ∙ Schendel, S.L. ∙ Fusco, M.L. ..., Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium Systematic analysis of monoclonal antibodies against Ebola virus GP defines features that contribute to protection Cell. 2018; 174 :938-952.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reports of human EVD cases revealed high plasma viral RNA titers at the time of patient admission into mAb treatment studies ( Brown et al., 2018 9. Brown, J.F. ∙ Dye, J.M. ∙ Tozay, S. ... Anti-Ebola virus antibody levels in convalescent plasma and viral load after plasma infusion in patients with Ebola virus disease J. Infect. Dis. 2018; 218 :555-562 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mbala-Kingebeni et al., 2019 57. Mbala-Kingebeni, P. ∙ Aziza, A. ∙ Di Paola, N. ... Medical countermeasures during the 2018 Ebola virus disease outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a rapid genomic assessment Lancet Infect. Dis. 2019; 19 :648-657 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, we observed high serum viral titers in each cohort of challenged NHPs before mAb treatment ( Figure 5 ), indicating that at the time of treatment many cells in multiple organs are already infected. This finding highlights the importance to retain Fc-mediated effector function activity in mAb cocktails in order to preserve the ability to eliminate infected cells. Conversely, using mouse challenge models we demonstrated that the complementary Fc-region-mediated functions of rEBOV-515-like neutralizing mAbs measured by in vitro assays do not benefit therapeutic efficacy but instead resulted in lower levels of in vivo protection. In the cocktails of EBOV-442 IgG1 + EBOV-515 LALA-PG, the stronger and broader neutralizing mAb EBOV-515 LALA-PG may act directly to neutralize circulating virus, and this activity is enhanced synergistically in the presence of rEBOV-442 IgG1. rEBOV-442 IgG1, in addition to direct virus neutralization, may act through Fc-mediated functions by binding to the non-overlapping antigenic site on the GP on infected cells, and this activity could be enhanced reciprocally in the presence of EBOV-515 LALA-PG. Such a combination of activities may facilitate viral clearance and potentially decrease the likelihood of viral mutations that facilitate escape from the cocktail treatment. The relative contribution of these activities to the therapeutic efficacy exhibited by this cocktail needs further investigation.
Defining the likelihood of the viral escape for clinical candidate mAbs has important implications for predicting therapeutic efficacy following mAb treatment ( Copin et al., 2021 13. Copin, R. ∙ Baum, A. ∙ Wloga, E. ... The monoclonal antibody combination REGEN-COV protects against SARS-CoV-2 mutational escape in preclinical and human studies Cell. 2021; 184 :3949-3961 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study suggests that individual mAbs may differ in their ability to limit the occurrence of escape variants and showed “orthogonality” of the escape mutations for broadly neutralizing mAbs we tested. In an outbreak scenario, implementation of several broad cocktails exhibiting such complementary neutralizing activities may safeguard against escape mutant selection in the population.
During acute EVD, circulating infectious virus sometimes seeds immune-privileged tissues, including the brain, eyes, and testes, and persist after clearance from the blood and recovery ( Diallo et al., 2016 17. Diallo, B. ∙ Sissoko, D. ∙ Loman, N.J. ... Resurgence of Ebola virus disease in Guinea linked to a survivor with virus persistence in seminal fluid for more than 500 days Clin. Infect. Dis. 2016; 63 :1353-1356 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ; Subtil et al., 2017 72. Subtil, F. ∙ Delaunay, C. ∙ Keita, A.K. ..., Postebogui Study Group Dynamics of Ebola RNA persistence in semen: a report from the postebogui cohort in Guinea Clin. Infect.

Persistence of Ebola virus in ocular fluid during convalescence N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2423-2427 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ). Until recently, it was generally assumed that Ebola epidemics start upon zoonotic transmission. On February 14, 2021, a new EVD outbreak was declared in Guinea, and viral genome sequencing reports suggested that the outbreak was caused by the Makona variant of EBOV that caused the 2014 EVD epidemics ( Keita et al., 2021 45. Keita, A.K. ∙ Koundouno, F.R. ∙ Faye, M. ... Resurgence of Ebola virus in 2021 in Guinea suggests a new paradigm for outbreaks Nature. 2021; 597 :539-543 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). The index case of the 2021 Guinea cluster likely was infected from a persistent source, such as via sexual transmission from an EVD survivor ( Keita et al., 2021 45. Keita, A.K. ∙ Koundouno, F.R. ∙ Faye, M. ... Resurgence of Ebola virus in 2021 in Guinea suggests a new paradigm for outbreaks Nature. 2021; 597 :539-543 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) raising concerns about possible person-to-person transmission and reignition of outbreaks. The existing therapies and those that are currently in clinical development should be evaluated for their efficacy in clearing infectious virus from immune-privileged sites. Further, NHP studies suggested a genetic drift upon selection pressure with sub-optimal mAb treatment that could be a potential cause for failure during EVD treatment ( Kugelman et al., 2015 47. Kugelman, J.R. ∙ Kugelman-Tonos, J. ∙ Ladner, J.T. ... Emergence of Ebola virus escape variants in infected nonhuman primates treated with the MB-003 antibody cocktail Cell Rep. 2015; 12 :2111-2120 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). Potent mAb cocktails like EBOV-442 IgG1 + EBOV-515 LALA-PG may help thwart antigenic drift by targeting non-overlapping vulnerable sites on GP and exhibiting complementary mechanisms of action.
In summary, these studies highlight the power of implementing a rational mAb cocktail development program using structure-function-guided principles (e.g., knowledge of binding sites, neutralization breadth, resistance to escape, multifunctionality, synergy, etc.). We identified a pan-ebolavirus biologic comprising a two-antibody cocktail that exhibits high efficacy for treatment of all three medically important ebolaviruses. These findings set the stage for clinical evaluation of pan-ebolavirus combination therapy with the two human antibodies rEBOV-442 IgG1 and rEBOV-515 LALA-PG.
The degree to which the Fc-region mediated effector functions studied in animal models using fully human EBOV-442 IgG1 and rEBOV-515 LALA-PG mAbs translated into a therapeutic potential by these mAbs against human EVD is unknown and should be further investigated. The protection of NHPs from advanced EVD by the described mAb cocktail treatment should be assessed in future studies. The developability (manufacturability) of antibodies described here needs to be assessed in future studies.

The EBOV isolate 199510621 (Kikwit variant) originated from a 65-year-old female patient who died on 5 May 1995. The study challenge material was from the second Vero-E6 passage of EBOV isolate 199510621. The first passage at UTMB consisted of inoculating CDC 807223 (passage 1 of EBOV isolate 199510621) at a MOI of 0.001 onto Vero E6 cells. SUDV isolate 200011676 (Gulu variant) originated from a 35-year-old male patient who died on 16 October 2000. The study challenge material was from the second Vero-E6 cell passage of SUDV isolate 200011676. The first passage at UTMB consisted of inoculating CDC 808892 (CDC passage 1 of SUDV isolate 200011676) at a MOI of 0.001 onto Vero-E6 cells. BDBV isolate 200706291 (Uganda variant) originated from serum of a patient collected in Uganda on 1 October 2007. The study challenge material was from the second Vero-E6 cell passage of BDBV isolate 200706291 variant Uganda. Briefly, the first passage at UTMB consisted of inoculating CDC 811250 (CDC passage 1 of BDBV isolate 200706291) at a MOI of 0.001 onto Vero-E6 cells. The cell culture fluids were subsequently harvested at day 10 post inoculation with each of indicated viruses and stored at −80°C as ∼1 mL aliquots. Neither mycoplasma nor endotoxin were detected (˂ 0.5 endotoxin units (EU)/mL).
Seven- to eight-week old female BALB/c mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed in microisolator cages and provided food and water ad libitum . Challenge studies were conducted under maximum containment in an animal biosafety level 4 (ABSL-4) facility of the Galveston National Laboratory, UTMB. The animal protocols for testing of mAbs in mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other applicable federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals.
Three- to four-year-old male (n = 6) or female (n = 6) rhesus macaques used in this study were obtained from PrimGen. Four-year-old male (n = 3) or female (n = 3) cynomolgus monkeys were obtained from Worldwide Primates. NHP research adhered to principles stated in the eighth edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals .

Sequences of monoclonal antibodies that had been synthesized as cDNA (Twist Bioscience) and cloned into an IgG1 or IgG1 LALA-PG monocistronic expression vector (designated as pTwist-mCis_G1 or pTwist-mCis_hG1 LALA-PG) were used for monoclonal antibody secretion in mammalian cell culture. This vector contains an enhanced 2A sequence and GSG linker that allows the simultaneous expression of monoclonal antibody heavy and light chain genes from a single construct upon transfection ( Chng et al., 2015 12. Chng, J. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Nian, R. ... Cleavage efficient 2A peptides for high level monoclonal antibody expression in CHO cells MAbs. 2015; 7 :403-412 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). CHO cell cultures were transfected using the GIBCO ExpiCHO Expression System protocols as described by the vendor. Culture supernatants were purified using 5 mL HiTrap MabSelect SuRe (Cytiva, formerly GE Healthcare Life Sciences) column and an ÄKTA pure chromatography system (Cytiva). Purified monoclonal antibodies were buffer-exchanged into PBS, concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 50-kDa centrifugal filter units (Millipore Sigma) and stored at 4 °C until use. For NHP treatment studies antibodies were purified from 5 to 15 L of CHO supernatant using HiScale 26/20 column (Cytiva) packed with MabSelect SuRe resin, purified protein was buffer-exchanged into PBS using HiScale 50/40 column packed with Sephadex G-25 (medium) resin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), concentrated, and stored at −80 °C until use. Purified monoclonal antibodies were tested routinely for endotoxin levels (found to be less than 30 EU per mg IgG for mouse studies and less than 1 EU per mg IgG for NHP studies). Endotoxin testing was performed using the PTS201F cartridge (Charles River), with a sensitivity range from 10 to 0.1 EU per mL, and an Endosafe Nexgen-MCS instrument (Charles River). For structural studies, Fab was produced after co-transfection of ExpiCHO cells with two separate mammalian expression vectors containing antibody light chain and Fab heavy chain sequences as described previously ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fab proteins were purified using CaptureSelect column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Purified antibodies were buffer-exchanged into PBS, concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter units (Millipore Sigma) and stored at 4°C until use.
For ELISA studies, the ectodomains of EBOV GP ΔTM (residues 1-636; strain Makona; GenBank: KM233070 ), BDBV GP ΔTM (residues 1-643; strain 200706291 Uganda; GenBank: NC_014373 ), and SUDV GP ΔTM (residues 1-637; strain Gulu; GenBank: NC_006432 ) were expressed and purified as described before ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). For structural studies, the ectodomain of EBOV/Makona GP (residues 32-644, GenBank AKG65268.1) lacking residues 310-460 of the mucin-like domain to produce EBOV/Makona GPΔMuc was produced and purified as described before ( Murin et al., 2021 61. Murin, C.D. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ...

To assess mAb binding at different pH, wells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated with purified, recombinant EBOV, BDBV or SUDV GPΔTM ectodomains at 4°C overnight. Plates were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk and 2% normal goat serum in DPBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (DPBS-T) for 1 h. Purified mAbs were diluted serially in DPBS-T (pH 7.4), or DPBS-T that was adjusted to pH 5.5 or 4.5 with hydrochloric acid, added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature. The bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-human IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech) diluted in blocking buffer. Color development was monitored using TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1N hydrochloric acid was added to stop the reaction, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (Biotek).
Binding of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled antibody to Jurkat-EBOV GP cell line was assessed by flow cytometry using an iQue Screener Plus high throughput flow cytometer (Intellicyt) as we described previously ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Serially-diluted Alexa Fluor 647-labeled antibody rEBOV-442 IgG1 or rEBOV-515 LALA-PG was titrated into serially-diluted unlabeled partner antibody to generate a pairwise combinatorial matrix of two antibodies in the mixture. For antibody dilutions and washes, we used DPBS (Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline) containing 2% of heat-inactivated FBS and 2 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium salt) (pH 8.0) designated as incubation buffer. For antibody staining, ∼5 × 10 4 Jurkat EBOV-GP cells were added per each well of V-bottom 96-well plate (Corning) in 5 μL of the incubation buffer, and antibody mixtures were added to the cells in duplicate for total volume of 50 μL per well, followed by 2 hr incubation at 4°C. Cells were washed with the incubation buffer by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min at ambient temperature and binding to the GP was assessed using iQue Screener Plus flow cytometer. Data for up to 5,000 events per well were acquired, and data were analyzed with ForeCyt (Intellicyt) software. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis on the basis of forward and side scatter gate for viable cell population. Binding was calculated as the percent of the maximal median fluorescence intensity signal (MFI) by the highest concentration of respective fluorescently-labeled antibody alone (25 μg/mL). Synergy distribution maps were generated from the dose-response binding matrix using a web application, SynergyFinder 2.0, and data were analyzed using ZIP synergy scoring model ( Ianevski et al., 2020 39. Ianevski, A. ∙ Giri, A.K. ∙ Aittokallio, T. SynergyFinder 2.0: visual analytics of multi-drug combination synergies Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :W488-W493 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To screen for escape mutations selected in the presence of individual antibodies or antibody cocktails, we used a real-time cell analysis (RTCA) assay and xCELLigence RTCA MP Analyzer (ACEA Biosciences) with modification of recently described assays ( Gilchuk et al., 2020a 33. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Bombardi, R.G. ∙ Erasmus, J.H. ... Integrated pipeline for the accelerated discovery of antiviral antibody therapeutics Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2020; 4 :1030-1043 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Greaney et al., 2021 36. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Starr, T.N. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ... Complete mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain that escape antibody recognition Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 29 :44-57.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fifty (50) μL of cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS) was added to each well of a 96-well E-plate to obtain a background reading. Eighteen thousand (18,000) Vero cells in 50 μL of cell culture medium were seeded per each well, and plates were placed on the analyzer. Measurements were taken automatically every 15 min and the sensograms were visualized using RTCA software version 2.1.0 (ACEA Biosciences Inc). VSV/EBOV GP virus (20,000 plaque forming units [PFU] per well, ∼1 MOI) was mixed with a saturating neutralizing concentration of individual antibody (10 μg/mL) or two-antibody cocktail (1:1 antibody ratio, 10 μg/mL total antibody concentration) in a total volume of 100 μL and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. At 16-20 h after seeding the cells, the virus-antibody mixtures were added into 8 to 96 replicate wells of 96-well E-plates with cell monolayers. Wells containing only virus in the absence of antibody and wells containing only Vero cells in medium were included on each plate as controls. Plates were measured continuously (every 15 min) for 72 h. The escape mutants were identified by delayed CPE in wells containing antibody. To verify escape from antibody selection, isolated viruses were assessed in a subsequent RTCA experiment in the presence of 20 μg/mL of antibody used for the escape selection, or 20 μg/mL of the other tested individual mAbs (rEBOV-442, rEBOV-515, ADI-15878, or ADI-15946), or 20 μg/mL of 1:1 cocktail of rEBOV-442+rEBOV-515 (see Figure S1 C).
To verify the escape phenotype mediated by mutations present in GP protein-expressing VSV antibody-selected escape variants, the escape viruses isolated after RTCA escape screening were propagated in 6-well culture plates with confluent Vero cells in the presence of 20 μg/mL of mAb used. Viral RNA was isolated using a QiAmp Viral RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN) from aliquots of supernatant containing a suspension of the selected virus population. The GP protein gene cDNA was amplified with a SuperScript IV One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using primers flanking the GP gene. The amplified PCR product (∼2,400 bp) was purified using SPRI magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 ratio and sequenced by the Sanger sequence technique using primers giving forward and reverse reads of the glycan cap region of the GP.
BSL-4 virus neutralization assays were performed using recombinant EBOV-eGFP or chimeric EBOV viruses in which GP was replaced with its counterpart from BDBV or SUDV, as described previously ( Ilinykh et al., 2016 40. Ilinykh, P.A. ∙ Shen, X. ∙ Flyak, A.I. ... Chimeric filoviruses for identification and characterization of monoclonal antibodies J. Virol. 2016; 90 :3890-3901 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, four-fold dilutions of the respective mAb starting at 200 μg/mL were mixed in triplicate with 400 PFU of the virus in U-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Mixtures were applied on Vero-E6 cell monolayer cultures in 96-well plates and incubated for four days at 37°C. In the absence of mAb neutralizing activity, the infection resulted in uniform eGFP fluorescence from the monolayer of cells that was detected readily by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence was measured using Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek). Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism software.
BSL-2 virus neutralization experiments were performed using the infectious rVSV/EBOV GP, rVSV/BDBV GP, and rVSV/SUDV GP viruses, and we adopted high-throughput RTCA assay that quantify virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) ( Gilchuk et al., 2020a 33. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Bombardi, R.G. ∙ Erasmus, J.H. ... Integrated pipeline for the accelerated discovery of antiviral antibody therapeutics Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2020; 4 :1030-1043 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Viruses were pre-titrated by RTCA to determine dilution of each virus stock to achieve similar CPE kinetics and complete CPE in 32 h after applying virus alone to Vero cells. Fifty (50) μL of cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS) was added to each well of a 96-well E-plate using a ViaFlo384 liquid handler (Integra Biosciences) to obtain background reading. Eighteen thousand (18,000) Vero cells in 50 μL of cell culture medium were seeded per each well, and the plate was placed on the analyzer. Measurements were taken automatically every 15 min, and the sensograms were visualized using RTCA software version 2.1.0 (ACEA Biosciences Inc). VSV/EBOV GP (∼0.1 MOI, ∼2,000 PFU per well), or VSV/BDBV GP (0.04 MOI, ∼800 PFU per well) or VSV/SUDV GP (0.01 MOI, ∼240 PFU per well) were mixed 1:1 with respective dilution of mAb in triplicate a total volume of 100 μL using DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS as a diluent and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . At 16 to 18 h after seeding the cells, the virus-mAb mixtures were added to the cells in 96-well E-plates. Triplicate wells containing virus only (maximal CPE in the absence of mAb) and wells containing only Vero cells in medium (no-CPE wells) were included as controls. Plates were measured continuously (every 15 min) for 48 h to assess virus neutralization. Normalized cellular index (CI) values at the endpoint (42 h after incubation with the virus) were determined using the RTCA software version 2.1.0 (ACEA Biosciences). Results were expressed as percent neutralization in the presence of a particular mAb relative to no-CPE control wells minus CI values from control wells with maximum CPE. RTCA IC 50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism software.
We used RTCA assay to assess neutralizing activity from a pairwise combinatorial matrix of two antibodies in the mixture. Serially-diluted rEBOV-442 (2-fold dilutions) was titrated into serially-diluted rEBOV-515 (two-fold dilutions) and incubated with rVSV/EBOV GP, rVSV/BDBV GP, or rVSV/SUDV GP viruses for 1 h at 37°C. Virus-antibody mixtures were applied to Vero cells grown in 96-well E-plates in duplicates for each virus and using separate plates for each pairwise combinatorial matrix. Triplicate wells containing virus only (maximal CPE in the absence of mAb) and wells containing only Vero cells in medium (no CPE wells) were included as controls. Plates were measured continuously (every 15 min) for 48 h to assess virus neutralization. Normalized cellular index (CI) values at the endpoint (42 h after incubation with the virus) were determined using the RTCA software version 2.1.0 (ACEA Biosciences). Results were expressed as percent neutralization in the presence of a particular mAb relative to control wells with no CPE minus CI values from control wells with maximum CPE. Synergy distribution maps were generated from the dose-response binding matrix using a web application, SynergyFinder 2.0, and data were analyzed using ZIP synergy scoring model ( Ianevski et al., 2020 39.

Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity of EBOV GP-reactive IgG was quantified with an EBOV-adapted modification of the RFADCC assay ( Domi et al., 2018 19. Domi, A. ∙ Feldmann, F. ∙ Basu, R. ... A single dose of modified Vaccinia Ankara expressing Ebola virus like particles protects nonhuman primates from lethal Ebola virus challenge Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :864 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Orlandi et al., 2016 62. Orlandi, C. ∙ Flinko, R. ∙ Lewis, G.K. A new cell line for high throughput HIV-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and cell-to-cell virus transmission studies J. Immunol. Methods. 2016; 433 :51-58 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a target cell line was made by transfecting 293F cells with a full-length DNA expressing GP from the EBOV (Kikwit variant) followed by transfecting with two separate DNA constructs expressing eGFP and the chimeric CCR5-SNAP tag protein. The new cell line, designated EBOV GPkik-293FS eGFP CCR5-SNAP, expresses EBOV-Kikwit GP on the plasma membrane, eGFP in the cytoplasm and the SNAP-tag CCR5, which can be specifically labeled with SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 647 (New England Biolabs), on the cell surface ( Domi et al., 2018 19. Domi, A. ∙ Feldmann, F. ∙ Basu, R. ... A single dose of modified Vaccinia Ankara expressing Ebola virus like particles protects nonhuman primates from lethal Ebola virus challenge Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :864 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). The unrelated human mAb DENV 2D22 and the Fc effector function disabled mAb rEBOV-515 LALA-PG were used as negative controls for the assay background. The ADCC activity was quantified by incubating three-fold serial dilutions of mAbs with EBOV GPkik-293FS eGFP CCR5-SNAP target cells for 15 min at ambient temperature and then adding human PBMC (STEMCELL Technologies) as effector cells for 2 hr at 37°C, after which cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained and analyzed using an iQue Screener Plus flow cytometer (Intellicyt). Data analysis was performed with ForeCyt (Intellicyt) software. The percentage cytotoxicity of the mAb was determined as the number of target cells losing eGFP signal (by virtue of ADCC) but retaining the surface expression of CCR5-SNAP.
The assay was performed as we described previously ( Gilchuk et al., 2018a 31. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Kuzmina, N. ∙ Ilinykh, P.A. ... Multifunctional pan-ebolavirus antibody recognizes a site of broad vulnerability on the Ebolavirus glycoprotein Immunity. 2018; 49 :363-374.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Jurkat-EBOV GP cells were pre-incubated with serial dilutions of mAbs in DPBS for 20 min at room temperature, then incubated with thermolysin (Promega) diluted in DPBS to 1 mg/mL for 20 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of the incubation buffer containing DPBS, 2% heat-inactivated FBS and 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). Washed cells were incubated with 5 μg/mL of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled EBOV GP RBD-reactive mAb MR78 ( Bornholdt et al., 2016 6. Bornholdt, Z.A. ∙ Ndungo, E. ∙ Fusco, M.L. ... Host-primed Ebola virus GP exposes a hydrophobic NPC1 receptor-binding pocket, revealing a target for broadly neutralizing antibodies MBio. 2016; 7 :e02154-15 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) at 4°C for 60 min. Stained cells were washed, fixed, and analyzed by flow cytometry using Intellicyt iQue. Cells were gated for the viable population, and median fluorescence intensity from Alexa Fluor 647 was determined. Background staining was determined from binding of the labeled mAb MR78 to Jurkat-EBOV GP (uncleaved) cells. Results are expressed as the percent of RBS exposure inhibition in the presence of tested mAb relative to controls for minimal binding of labeled MR78 mAb-only to intact (uncleaved) Jurkat EBOV-GP, and maximal binding of labeled MR78 mAb-only to cleaved Jurkat-EBOV GP.
Groups of mice (n = 5 per group) were inoculated with 1,000 PFU of the EBOV-MA by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Mice were treated i.p. with indicated doses of individual mAbs on 1 day after virus inoculation (dpi). Human mAb DENV 2D22 served as a control. Mice were monitored twice daily from 0 to 14 dpi for illness, survival, and weight loss, followed by once daily monitoring from 15 dpi to the end of the study at 28 dpi. The extent of disease was scored using the following parameters: score 1 – healthy; score 2 – ruffled fur and hunched posture; score 3 – a score of 2 plus one additional clinical sign such as orbital tightening and/or >15% weight loss; score 4 – a score of 3 plus one additional clinical sign such as reluctance to move when stimulated, or any neurologic signs (seizures, tremors, head tilt, paralysis, etc.), or >20% weight loss. Animals reaching a score of 4 were euthanized as per the IACUC-approved protocol. All mice were euthanized on day 28 after EBOV challenge.
Twelve healthy adult rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) of Chinese origin and six healthy adult cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis ) were studied. Animals were assigned to three groups of five animals per treatment group and a control untreated animal. Animals were randomized by random number assignment (with Microsoft Excel) into a treatment group and a control animal. Previous studies showed a difference of the disease courses between EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV challenged NHP models of EVD ( Bornholdt et al., 2019 7. Bornholdt, Z.A. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ∙ Mire, C.E. ...

USA. 2020; 117 :3768-3778 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBOV causes rapid infection with readily detectable systemic viremia by 3 dpi. In the SUDV challenge model, the disease course is slower than that caused by EBOV, and the disease course caused by BDBV is even slower than those of EBOV or SUDV. Given these differences, the first antibody treatment in each model was delivered at the earliest time points after viral challenge at which animals are expected to be uniformly viremic ( e.g ., day 3 after EBOV, day 4 after SUDV, or day 6 after BDBV challenge). The treatment schedule using a two-dose 30 mg/kg/dose regimen given 3 days apart was the same as in our previous work in which we tested a different cocktail of mAbs (rEBOV-520 LALA + rEBOV-548 IgG) in NHPs against EBOV only ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) to allow comparisons between two studies. After intramuscular challenge with a lethal target dose of 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of EBOV/Kikwit, BDBV/Uganda, or SUDV/Gulu, each of the NHPs of the treatment group received intravenously two 30 mg/kg doses of the cocktail (a 2:1 mixture of rEBOV-515 LALA-PG and rEBOV-442 IgG1) spaced 3 days apart (days 3 and 6 after EBOV/Kikwit, days 6 and 9 after BDBV/Uganda, or days 4 and 7 after SUDV/Gulu inoculation). The back-titer of the EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV inoculum identified 963, 1113, and 988 PFU as the actual inoculation dose for the respective virus. Historical untreated controls for EBOV challenge cohort included fourteen untreated animals from separate studies including 11 animals, as we reported previously ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were challenged with the same target dose of EBOV/Kikwit and by the same route. Historical untreated controls for SUDV/Gulu challenge cohort included five untreated animals from previous study ( Thi et al., 2016 73. Thi, E.P. ∙ Lee, A.C. ∙ Geisbert, J.B. ... Rescue of non-human primates from advanced Sudan ebolavirus infection with lipid encapsulated siRNA Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 :16142 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) and four untreated animals from two other studies (T.W.G. and R.W.C., unpublished data) that were challenged with the same target dose of BDBV and by the same route. Historical untreated controls for BDBV challenge cohort included three untreated animals from a previous study ( Bornholdt et al., 2019 7. Bornholdt, Z.A. ∙ Herbert, A.S. ∙ Mire, C.E. ... A two-antibody pan-ebolavirus cocktail confers broad therapeutic protection in ferrets and nonhuman primates Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :49-58.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) and seventeen untreated animals from the other studies (T.W.G. and R.W.C., unpublished data) that were challenged with the same target dose of BDBV/Uganda and by the same route. All animals were given physical exams, and blood was collected at the time of inoculation and at indicated times after virus inoculation. In addition, all animals were monitored daily and scored for disease progression with an internal filovirus scoring protocol approved by the UTMB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The scoring measured from baseline and included posture or activity level, attitude or behavior, food and water intake, respiration, and disease manifestations such as visible rash, hemorrhage, ecchymosis, or flushed skin. A score of ≥ 9 indicated that an animal met criteria for euthanasia. These studies were not blinded, and all animals were included in analysis.
Titration of virus in plasma samples and 10% tissue homogenates (w/v) was performed by plaque assay in Vero-E6 cell culture monolayers. Briefly, serial 10-fold dilutions of the samples were applied to Vero-E6 cell monolayers in duplicate wells (200 μL); the limit of detection was 25 PFU/mL for plasma and 250 PFU/gram for tissue. For qRT-PCR analysis, RNA was isolated from whole blood or tissue using the Viral RNA Mini-kit (QIAGEN) using 100 μL of blood or 100 mg of tissue into 600 μL of buffer AVL. Primers (probes) targeting the VP30 gene of EBOV probe sequence of 6-carboxyflourescein (6FAM)-5′ CCG TCA ATC AAG GAG CGC CTC 3′-6 carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the VP35 intergenic region of BDBV probe sequence of 6FAM-5′ CGCAACCTCCACAGTCGCCT 3′-TAMRA, and the L gene of SUDV probe sequence of 6FAM-5′ CAT CCA ATC AAA GAC ATT GCG A 3′-TAMRA were used for qRT-PCR. EBOV RNA was detected using the CFX96 detection system (BioRad Laboratories) in One-step probe qRT-PCR kits (QIAGEN) with the following cycle conditions: 50°C for 10 min, 95°C for 10 s, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 57°C for 30 s for EBOV and BDBV and 50°C for 10 min, 95°C for 10 s, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 59°C for 30 s for SUDV. Threshold cycle (CT) values representing EBOV, BDBV and SUDV genomes were analyzed with CFX Manager Software, and data are depicted as genome equivalents (GEq); the limit of detection was 3.7 log 10 GEq/mL for blood and 3.7 log 10 GEq/g for the tissues.
Serum samples collected from NHPs were tested for concentrations of albumin, amylase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, and C-reactive protein by using a Piccolo point-of-care analyzer and Abbott Piccolo BioChemistry Panel Plus analyzer discs (Fisher Scientific).
EBOV/Makona GPΔmuc was incubated overnight with a 5-fold molar excess of rEBOV-515 Fab, rEBOV-442 Fab, and rADI-16061 Fab at 4°C. The complexes were then purified by SEC using an S200I column equilibrated in 1X TBS and concentrated to 5 mg/mL using a 100-kDa concentrator (Amicon Ultra, Millipore). Immediately prior to freezing, 0.06 mM of n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (Anatrace) was added to 3 μL of the complex. Vitrification was performed with a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equilibrated to 4°C and 100% humidity. Cryo-EM grids were plasma cleaned for 5 s using a mixture of Ar/O2 (Gatan Solarus 950 Plasma system) followed by blotting on both sides of the grid with filter paper (Whattman No. 1). See Table S7 for additional details. Note that ADI-16061 Fab was added to assist in angular sampling and orientations of the complexes in ice as we described previously ( Gilchuk et al., 2020b 34. Gilchuk, P. ∙ Murin, C.D. ∙ Milligan, J.C. ... Analysis of a therapeutic antibody cocktail reveals determinants for cooperative and broad ebolavirus neutralization Immunity. 2020; 52 :388-403.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cryo-EM data were collected according to Table S7 . Micrographs were aligned and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 85. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ). CTF estimation was completed using GCTF ( Zheng et al., 2017 85. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle picking and initial 2D classification were initially performed using CryoSPARC 2.0 ( Punjani et al., 2017 66. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ) to clean up particle stacks and exclude any complexes that were degrading. Particle picks were then imported into Relion 3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 86. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 3D classification and refinement using C3 symmetry and a tight mask around the GP/rEBOV-515 Fab/rEBOV-442 Fab complex. CTF refinement was then performed by either Relion or Cryosparc to increase map quality and resolution. There was no electron density for ADI-16061 Fab.
Homology models of Fab were first generated using SWISS-MODEL ( Biasini et al., 2014 5. Biasini, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ∙ Waterhouse, A. ... SWISS-MODEL: modelling protein tertiary and quaternary structure using evolutionary information Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W252-8 Crossref Scopus (3931) PubMed Google Scholar ). A model of EBOV GP (PDB: 5JQ3 ) was then added to generate a starting model used for refinement. The starting model was fit into the cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 65. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refined initially using Phenix real-space refinement ( Liebschner et al., 2019 54. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3348) PubMed Google Scholar ). The refined model was then used as a starting model for relaxed refinement in Rosetta ( DiMaio et al., 2015 18. DiMaio, F. ∙ Song, Y. ∙ Li, X. ... Atomic-accuracy models from 4.5-Å cryo-electron microscopy data with density-guided iterative local refinement Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :361-365 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ). The top five models then were evaluated for fit in EM density and adjusted manually using Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 20. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) to maximize fit. Finally, Man9 glycans were fit into glycan densities, trimmed and then a final refinement was performed in Rosetta. The final structures were evaluated using EMRinger ( Barad et al., 2015 2. Barad, B.A. ∙ Echols, N. ∙ Wang, R.Y. ... EMRinger: side chain-directed model and map validation for 3D cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :943-946 Crossref Scopus (542) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Molprobity from Phenix. Glycans were validated using Privateer ( Agirre et al., 2015 1. Agirre, J. ∙ Iglesias-Fernández, J. ∙ Rovira, C. ... Privateer: software for the conformational validation of carbohydrate structures Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :833-834 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PDBcare ( Lütteke and von der Lieth, 2004 56. Lütteke, T. ∙ von der Lieth, C.W. pdb-care (PDB carbohydrate residue check): a program to support annotation of complex carbohydrate structures in PDB files BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5 :69 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). All map and model images were generated in UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 65. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antibody contacts were analyzed using LigPlot ( Laskowski and Swindells, 2011 50. Laskowski, R.A. ∙ Swindells, M.B. LigPlot+: multiple ligand-protein interaction diagrams for drug discovery J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2011; 51 :2778-2786 Crossref Scopus (4092) PubMed Google Scholar ), Arpeggio ( Jubb et al., 2017 42. Jubb, H.C. ∙ Higueruelo, A.P. ∙ Ochoa-Montaño, B. ... Arpeggio: A web server for calculating and visualising interatomic interactions in protein structures J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 :365-371 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ) and UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 65. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The descriptive statistics mean ± SEM or mean ± SD were determined for continuous variables as noted. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and overall difference in survival between the groups in mouse studies was estimated using two-sided log rank test (Mantel-Cox) with subjects right censored, if they survived until the end of the study. In NHP studies, survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the proportion surviving at day 28 after virus inoculation was compared using a 2-sided exact unconditional test of homogeneity. Curves for antibody binding were fitted after log transformation of antibody concentrations using a four-parameter log-logistic (4PL) analysis. In neutralization assays and GP cleavage inhibition assays, IC 50 values were calculated after log transformation of antibody concentrations using a four-parameter log-logistic (4PL) analysis. Synergy distribution maps were generated from the dose-response binding matrix using an open-source software SynergyFinder 2.0: visual analytics of multi-drug combination synergies ( https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi ), and data were analyzed using ZIP synergy scoring model ( Ianevski et al., 2020 39. Ianevski, A. ∙ Giri, A.K. ∙ Aittokallio, T. SynergyFinder 2.0: visual analytics of multi-drug combination synergies Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :W488-W493 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Technical and biological replicates are indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism v8.4.3 (GraphPad).
