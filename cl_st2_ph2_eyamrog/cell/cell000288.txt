Title: Structural basis of human monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibition by anti-cancer drug candidates


Abstract: Summary

Proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters MCT1-4 catalyze the transmembrane movement of metabolically essential monocarboxylates and have been targeted for cancer treatment because of their enhanced expression in various tumors. Here, we report five cryo-EM structures, at resolutions of 3.0–3.3 Å, of human MCT1 bound to lactate or inhibitors in the presence of Basigin-2, a single transmembrane segment (TM)-containing chaperon. MCT1 exhibits similar outward-open conformations when complexed with lactate or the inhibitors BAY-8002 and AZD3965. In the presence of the inhibitor 7ACC2 or with the neutralization of the proton-coupling residue Asp309 by Asn, similar inward-open structures were captured. Complemented by structural-guided biochemical analyses, our studies reveal the substrate binding and transport mechanism of MCTs, elucidate the mode of action of three anti-cancer drug candidates, and identify the determinants for subtype-specific sensitivities to AZD3965 by MCT1 and MCT4. These findings lay out an important framework for structure-guided drug discovery targeting MCTs.

Section: Introduction

Monocarboxylates, exemplified by lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies, are essential metabolites in most mammalian cells. Transmembrane movement of monocarboxylates is vital for cells that rely on glycolysis for energy supply ( Halestrap et al., 1990 28. Halestrap, A.P. ∙ Poole, R.C. ∙ Cranmer, S.L.

The proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family: structure, function and regulation Biochem. J. 1999; 343 :281-299 Crossref Scopus (1148) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dynamic absorption and redistribution of these metabolites is executed by two types of monocarboxylate transporters in human, the proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) ( Garcia et al., 1994 22.

MCTs belong to the solute carrier family 16 (SLC16), or in a different classification system, the monocarboxylate porter (MPC) family of the Major facilitator superfamily (MFS) ( Halestrap, 2013 24. Halestrap, A.P. The SLC16 gene family - structure, role and regulation in health and disease Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34 :337-349 Crossref Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan, 2015 63. Yan, N. Structural Biology of the Major Facilitator Superfamily Transporters Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2015; 44 :257-283 Crossref Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the fourteen identified MCTs, MCT1-MCT4 catalyze proton-coupled influx or efflux of monocarboxylate ( Halestrap and Meredith, 2004 25. Halestrap, A.P. ∙ Meredith, D. The SLC16 gene family-from monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) to aromatic amino acid transporters and beyond Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447 :619-628 Crossref Scopus (881) PubMed Google Scholar ; Poole and Halestrap, 1993 47. Poole, R.C. ∙ Halestrap, A.P. Transport of lactate and other monocarboxylates across mammalian plasma membranes Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264 :C761-C782 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ); the transport direction is determined by the proton motive force and the concentration gradient of the substrate monocarboxylate. Proper localization and function of MCT1-4 requires glycosylated chaperon proteins, such as Basigin (also known as CD147 or EMMPRIN) for MCT1/3/4 and Embigin (also known as gp70) for MCT2 ( Halestrap and Wilson, 2012 27.

Chem. 2005; 280 :27213-27221 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Under physiological conditions, MCT1-4 cooperate to form a lactate shuttling system that maintains lactate homeostasis between glycolytic and oxidative cells. Lactate exported from glycolytic cells is taken by oxidative cells for aerobic metabolism, as observed between the white-glycolytic and red-oxidative cells in skeleton muscles, and between astrocytes and neurons in the brain ( Brooks, 2018 5.

Neurosci. 1998; 20 :291-299 Crossref Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar ).
MCT1/2/4 are known to contribute to cancer development through multiple mechanisms ( Payen et al., 2020 40. Payen, V.L. ∙ Mina, E. ∙ Van Hée, V.F. ... Monocarboxylate transporters in cancer Mol. Metab. 2020; 33 :48-66 Crossref Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ). While glycolytic cancer cells rely on anaerobic glycolysis to adapt to the hypoxic environment, oxidative cancer cells take in lactate secreted from glycolytic cancer cells for energy supply, a hypothesis known as the “metabolic symbiosis,” wherein MCT1 and MCT4 play a critical role for lactate shuttling ( Pisarsky et al., 2016 45.

Sonveaux, P. ∙ Végran, F. ∙ Schroeder, T. ... Targeting lactate-fueled respiration selectively kills hypoxic tumor cells in mice J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118 :3930-3942 PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, oxidative cancer cells, by forcing the adjacent stromal fibroblasts to adopt aerobic glycolysis, acquire additional lactate supply via MCT1/4-mediated lactate shuttling ( Pavlides et al., 2009 39. Pavlides, S. ∙ Whitaker-Menezes, D. ∙ Castello-Cros, R. ...

Evidence for a stromal-epithelial “lactate shuttle” in human tumors: MCT4 is a marker of oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts Cell Cycle. 2011; 10 :1772-1783 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to being directly involved in metabolism, lactate influx in vascular endothelial cells serves as a signal to promote tumor angiogenesis ( De Saedeleer et al., 2012 13. De Saedeleer, C.J. ∙ Copetti, T. ∙ Porporato, P.E. ...

Lactate influx through the endothelial cell monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 supports an NF-κB/IL-8 pathway that drives tumor angiogenesis Cancer Res. 2011; 71 :2550-2560 Crossref Scopus (619) PubMed Google Scholar ). Excess lactic acid in the extracellular niche of tumor, secreted through MCT1 and 4, confers immune tolerance to cancer cells ( Dietl et al., 2010 15. Dietl, K. ∙ Renner, K. ∙ Dettmer, K. ... Lactic acid and acidification inhibit TNF secretion and glycolysis of human monocytes J. Immunol. 2010; 184 :1200-1209 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fischer et al., 2007 20.

Owing to the critical functions of lactate in cancer development, intervention of lactate metabolism by inhibiting MCTs represents a promising strategy for chemotherapy ( Bola et al., 2014 3. Bola, B.M. ∙ Chadwick, A.L. ∙ Michopoulos, F. ... Inhibition of monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) by AZD3965 enhances radiosensitivity by reducing lactate transport Mol.

Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :3685-3692 Crossref Scopus (824) PubMed Google Scholar ). Early-age MCTs inhibitors, such as phloretin and quercetin, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, and 4,4’-di-iso-thiocyanostilbene-2,2’-disulfonate, are generally of low affinity and poor specificity ( Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994 7.

Acta. 2016; 1863 :2481-2497 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, three classes of more potent MCT1 inhibitors, exemplified by AZD3965, BAY-8002, and 7ACC2, have been reported with IC 50 or K i at nM range ( Draoui et al., 2013 17.

Cancer Ther. 2018; 17 :2285-2296 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). AZD3965, a derivative of AR-C155858, is in phase I clinical trials. It was reported to inhibit MCT1 and MCT2 with K d of ∼1.6 nM and ∼9.6 nM, respectively, but showed no effect on MCT4 ( Critchlow et al., 2012 10. Critchlow, S.E. ∙ Hopcroft, L. ∙ Mooney, L. ...

J. 2010; 431 :217-225 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, BAY-8002 has a 5-fold selectivity to MCT1 over MCT2, and no inhibition on MCT4. Competitive inhibition of MCT1 by AZD3965 and BAY-8002 indicated a similar binding site for these two ligands ( Quanz et al., 2018 50. Quanz, M. ∙ Bender, E. ∙ Kopitz, C. ... Preclinical Efficacy of the Novel Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 Inhibitor BAY-8002 and Associated Markers of Resistance Mol. Cancer Ther. 2018; 17 :2285-2296 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). 7ACC2 inhibits lactate influx, but not efflux in MCT1/4-expressing cancer cells, suggesting a mode of action (MOA) different from AR-C155858 ( Draoui et al., 2013 17. Draoui, N. ∙ Schicke, O. ∙ Fernandes, A. ... Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of carboxycoumarins as a new antitumor treatment targeting lactate transport in cancer cells Bioorg. Med.

Cancer Ther. 2014; 13 :1410-1418 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ).
An advanced understanding of the MOA of these inhibitors requires high-resolution structures of MCTs. A model of inward-open rat MCT1 (rMCT1) in complex with AR-C155858 was computationally constructed ( Nancolas et al., 2015 35. Nancolas, B. ∙ Sessions, R.B. ∙ Halestrap, A.P. Identification of key binding site residues of MCT1 for AR-C155858 reveals the molecular basis of its isoform selectivity Biochem. J. 2015; 467 :192 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). The crystal structure of lactate-bound SfMCT, a prokaryotic homolog of human MCT1 from Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, was resolved at 2.6 Å in an outward-open conformation ( Bosshart et al., 2019 4. Bosshart, P.D. ∙ Kalbermatter, D. ∙ Bonetti, S. ... Mechanistic basis of L-lactate transport in the SLC16 solute carrier family Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2649 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, a cryo-EM structure of homodimeric MCT2 was reported at 3.8 Å in an inward-open state ( Zhang et al., 2020 68. Zhang, B. ∙ Jin, Q. ∙ Xu, L. ... Cooperative transport mechanism of human monocarboxylate transporter 2 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2429 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). But neither structure provides information on the chaperons Basigin or Embigin ( Halestrap and Wilson, 2012 27. Halestrap, A.P. ∙ Wilson, M.C. The monocarboxylate transporter family--role and regulation IUBMB Life. 2012; 64 :109-119 Crossref Scopus (542) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kirk et al., 2000 30. Kirk, P. ∙ Wilson, M.C. ∙ Heddle, C. ... CD147 is tightly associated with lactate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 and facilitates their cell surface expression EMBO J. 2000; 19 :3896-3904 Crossref Scopus (567) PubMed Google Scholar ). More importantly, experimental structures are required to reveal the accurate binding site of the inhibitors to facilitate drug discovery.
Here, we report four cryo-EM structures of the wild type (WT) human MCT1/Basigin-2 complex separately bound to lactate and the three prototypal MCT inhibitors, AZD3965, BAY-8002, and 7ACC2, all at 3.0–3.3 Å resolutions. We also solved the structure of a proton-coupling mutant MCT1(D309N)/Basigin-2 at 3.3 Å resolution. These structures and extensive biochemical characterizations provide an unprecedented understanding of the working and inhibition mechanism of MCT proteins, which will facilitate drug discovery for cancer treatment.

Section: Results

Human MCT1, WT or the mutant D309N, and Basigin-2 were co-expressed in Sf9 cells and purified through tandem affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) ( Figure S1 A). For cryo-sample preparation, the purified proteins were supplemented with L-lactate at a final concentration of 50 mM or the three inhibitors, AZD3965, BAY-8002, and 7ACC2, each at 600 μM. Details for cryo-sample preparation and cryo-EM data acquisition can be found in STAR Methods ( Figures S1 A and S1B).
The electron micrographs, 2D class averages, and initial model all showed a thick detergent micelle and a flexible extracellular domain (ECD) that likely belonged to the two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in Basigin-2 ( Figure S1 B). The small size (∼85 kD) and lack of a stable soluble domain posed major technical challenges for data processing. Conventional image processing methods failed to yield 3D reconstructions beyond 15 Å resolution. To overcome these technical barriers, we developed a strategy that combined noise reduction and re-weighting methods with our previously developed “guided multi-reference 3D classification” ( Zhang et al., 2017 67. Zhang, X. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Hang, J. ... An Atomic Structure of the Human Spliceosome Cell. 2017; 169 :918-929 e914 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). This strategy, presented in detail in STAR Methods , effectively eliminated the strong noises and identified good particles ( Figures S1 , S2 , and S3 ).
After several rounds of 3D classification and refinement by RELION3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 70. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CRYOSPARC2.14 ( Punjani et al., 2017 49. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ), the resolutions of all five complexes reached 3.3–3.6 Å. A “seed”-facilitated 3D classification and CTF refinement strategy further improved the resolutions of the transmembrane (TM) region to 3.0–3.3 Å according to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion ( Figures 1 A–1D, Figures S2 , S3 , and S4 ; Table S1 ). For the structure of lactate bound MCT1/Basigin-2 complex, additional refinement was performed with an overall mask in RELION ( Zivanov et al., 2018 70. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ) to eliminate any possible artifact that may affect the identification of lactate ( Figure S3 D). For simplicity, we will hereafter refer to the five complexes as MCT1L (with lactate), MCT1N (with the D309N), MCT1A (with AZD3965), MCT1B (with BAY-8002), and MCT1C (with 7ACC2).
Secondary structural elements and most side chains in the TM region were clearly resolved, allowing for assignment of ∼410 side chains in the heterodimeric complex ( Figures 1 A–1D, Table S1 ). Consistent with its flexibility, the resolution of the ECD in Basigin-2 is much lower, only allowing for backbone tracing of the TM-connected Ig2 and rigid-body docking of the distal Ig1 ( Figure 1 B). The five structures exhibit two major conformations, outward-open for MCT1L/A/B, and inward-open for MCT1N/C ( Figure 1 A). We will discuss the alternating access changes in a later session.
The overall structure of the TM region in all complexes is approximately 100 Å in height and 50 Å in the longest dimension of width. MCT1 contains 12 TMs that conform to the canonical MFS fold ( Figure 1 A). The single TM of Basigin-2 contacts TM6 of MCT1 mostly through hydrophobic interactions ( Figures 1 E and 1F). A membrane embedded hydrogen bond (H-bond) is found between Basigin-2(Glu218) and MCT1(Asn187), consistent with the previous report that Basigin-2(Glu218) is critical for MCT engagement ( Manoharan et al., 2006 33. Manoharan, C. ∙ Wilson, M.C. ∙ Sessions, R.B. ... The role of charged residues in the transmembrane helices of monocarboxylate transporter 1 and its ancillary protein basigin in determining plasma membrane expression and catalytic activity Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23 :486-498 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 F).
Sequence analysis shows that Asn187 is conserved in MCT1/2/4, while MCT3 has a His at the corresponding locus. The polar residue His should still be H-bonded with Glu218 of Basigin-2 ( Figure 1 F, right, Figure S5 ). On the other hand, Embigin, the MCT2 chaperon, also has a Glu at the position equivalent to Basigin-2(Glu218). Therefore, the polar pair should be conserved between MCT1-4 and their chaperons to protect the polar residue on TM6 from the hydrophobic lipid bilayer. To validate this essential polar interaction, two variants, MCT1(N187A) and Basigin-2(E218A), were generated. Basigin-2(E218A) could not be detected in our expression system. When co-expressed, only residual amount of WT Basigin-2 was found in complex with MCT1-N187A ( Figure 1 G, Lanes 1 and 2), validating the importance of the polar pair in stabilizing the complex.
In the structure of MCT1L, the amino and carboxyl terminal domains (NTD and CTD) enclose a cavity that opens to the extracellular side, a state defined as outward-open ( Figure 2 A). The central pocket is positively charged owing to two basic residues from the two domains, Lys38 on TM1 and Arg313 on TM8. They are contiguous with a sandwiched density ( Figure 2 B). The shape and the chemical environment suggested that the density might belong to the supplemented substrate, L-lactate ( Figure 2 B, inset). The structural observation is consistent with the suggested function of Lys38 and Arg313 in recognizing acidic substrates ( Wilson et al., 2009 61. Wilson, M.C. ∙ Meredith, D. ∙ Bunnun, C. ... Studies on the DIDS-binding site of monocarboxylate transporter 1 suggest a homology model of the open conformation and a plausible translocation cycle J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :20011-20021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, the symmetric nature of lactate prevented accurate assignment of substrate orientation. Considering the electrostatic attraction, the carboxyl group of lactate was modeled in the vicinity of Lys38 and Arg313.
The substrate-binding pocket is constituted by Tyr34 and Lys38 on TM1, Asp309 and Arg313 on TM8, and Phe367 and Ser371 on TM10 ( Figure 2 C). To corroborate the structural observation, MCT1 variants each containing a single point substitution of the pocket-forming residues were generated and their lactate transport activities in the presence of Basigin-2 were examined using a counterflow assay ( Sun et al., 2012 56. Sun, L. ∙ Zeng, X. ∙ Yan, C. ... Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of glucose transporters GLUT1-4 Nature. 2012; 490 :361-366 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ).
As expected, Ala substitution of Lys38 or Arg313 led to complete loss of transport activity. R313Q, a mutation that was associated with MCT1 deficiency (MCT1D) syndrome ( van Hasselt et al., 2015 57. van Hasselt, P.M. ∙ Ferdinandusse, S. ∙ van Haaften, G. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 deficiency and ketone utilization N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :578-579 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), showed no transport activity in our assay. F367A reduced the activity significantly, and S371A cut the activity by more than 50%. Y34F markedly reduced the activity, supporting the importance of the hydroxyl group of Tyr34 in substrate recognition ( Figure 2 D). Asp309 has been proposed to be the proton coupling residue ( Zhang et al., 2020 68. Zhang, B. ∙ Jin, Q. ∙ Xu, L. ... Cooperative transport mechanism of human monocarboxylate transporter 2 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2429 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neutralization of this acidic residue by Asn also abolished lactate transport activity ( Figure 2 D). Loss of function of D309N in our counterflow assay, which does not require proton gradient, suggests that Asp309 may play an additional role in transport process.
In the outward-open state, the substrate binding site is insulated from cytosol by TM4, 5, 10, and 11. Three H-bond networks are observed from cytosolic side including the interaction of Arg143-Glu376-Asp380 between TM5 and TM10, Tyr140-Lys141-N321-Arg326 between TM5 and TM8, and Asn81-Ser388-Ser389 between TM2 and TM11 ( Figure 2 E).
The outward-open structure of MCT1L was obtained under pH 8.0, which may represent a deprotonated state for residues exposed to the aqueous milieu. To capture the structure of MCT1 in additional working states, we prepared the sample at lower pH conditions. At pH 6.0, both outward- and inward-facing states of MCT1 were revealed from 3D classifications ( Figure 3 A). However, high-resolution reconstruction could not be obtained, likely due to the high dynamics of the complex.
Inspired by this observation, we set out to determine the structure of MCT1(D309N), which mimics a constitutively protonated state. Indeed, the structure of this variant, referred to as MCT1N, was solved in an inward-open state ( Figure 3 B). In this structure, a similar central substrate binding pocket is observed. Lys38 and Arg313, which sandwich the putative substrate density in the outward open structure, face each other in the middle of the central tunnel ( Figure 3 B). Despite addition of 50 mM lactate to the cryo-sample of MCT1N, no extra density was observed in the central cavity.
Structural comparison of MCT1N and MCT1L sheds light on the mechanistic understanding of proton coupling. In the outward-open MCT1L, the carboxyl group of Asp309 directly interacts with the guanidinium group of Arg313 ( Figure 3 C, left). In MCT1N, their interaction is broken, a seemingly subtle but critical shift that releases Arg313 ( Figure 3 C, middle). In this conformation, Arg313 can no longer interact with the carbonyl oxygen of Met151, hence lifting the restraint of TM5 ( Figure 3 C, right).
Taken together, the displacement of Asn309 (or protonated Asp309) and Arg313 may facilitate the conformational transition of MCT1, leading to the alternating access upon protonation and substrate binding, a paradigm that is also derived from the structural comparison of the proton symporter XylE and uniporter GLUT1 ( Deng et al., 2014 14. Deng, D. ∙ Xu, C. ∙ Sun, P. ... Crystal structure of the human glucose transporter GLUT1 Nature. 2014; 510 :121-125 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ). This structural observation is consistent with the previous report that Asp309 plays an essential role in proton coupling ( Zhang et al., 2020 68. Zhang, B. ∙ Jin, Q. ∙ Xu, L. ... Cooperative transport mechanism of human monocarboxylate transporter 2 Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2429 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is also noted that the current conformations of Lys38 and Arg313 do not favor interaction with a monocarboxylate substrate. Therefore, MCT1N may represent a protonated, substrate-released or prebinding state.
Despite these local changes, domain-wise comparison of MCT1L and MCT1N shows that the alternating access of MCT1 is achieved through rigid-body rotation of the two domains ( Figure 3 D, Video S1 ). The NTD and CTD of MCT1L can be respectively superimposed with those in MCT1N with root-mean-standard deviation (RMSD) values of 0.71 Å over 173 Cα atoms and 0.66 Å over 187 Cα atoms ( Figure 3 D). The TM of Basigin-2 moves concertedly with the NTD ( Figure 3 D, left). To keep the TM region within the membrane, the NTD and CTD both have to undergo rotations relative to an axis that is parallel to the membrane plane by approximately 14° and 15°, respectively ( Figure 3 E). In the inward-open state, TM1, 2, 7 and 8 seal the extracellular side. Four hydrogen bonds, including Lys45-Tyr419, Glu46-Lys289, Thr54-Asp414 and Gln166-S295, contribute to the closure of the extracellular gate ( Figure 3 F).

An alternating access cycle of the MCT1/Basigin-2 complex, related to Figures 3 and 7 Alternating access of MCT1 is achieved through rigid-body rotation of the two domains. The TM of Basigin-2 moves concertedly with the NTD. The morph, with the first and last frames using the structures of MCT1B and MCT1C, respectively, was generated in CNS ( Brünger et al., 1998 6. Brünger, A.T. ∙ Adams, P.D. ∙ Clore, G.M. ... Crystallography & NMR system: A new software suite for macromolecular structure determination Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 1998; 54 :905-921 Crossref Scopus (17071) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Next, we examined the MOA of the three representative inhibitors. As mentioned earlier, structures of MCT1 in complex with BAY-8002 and AZD3965 both exhibit outward-open conformation, while 7ACC2 locks MCT1 in an inward-open state ( Figures 1 A and 4 A).
The overall structure of the outward-open MCT1B is nearly identical with that of MCT1L, with a RMSD of 0.71 Å over 365 aligned Cα atoms. Similarly, the inward-open MCT1C can be superimposed with MCT1N with RMSD of 0.28 Å over 381 aligned Cα atoms ( Figure 4 A). Both BAY-8002 and 7ACC2 occupy the central substrate binding cavity despite the distinct conformations of MCT1. Therefore, these two compounds both compete with substrate binding and block the transport activity of MCT1 by preventing alternating access ( Figure 4 B).
In the structure of MCT1B, BAY-8002 was unambiguously resolved in the 3D EM reconstruction ( Figure 4 C). The benzoic acid group of BAY-8002 occupies the potential central substrate binding site. Despite the much larger size of the inhibitor, the residues that surround BAY-8002 exhibit similar conformation to those in MCT1L ( Figure 4 D). Therefore, the coordination of the carboxylate group of BAY-8002 may represent the general binding mode for the carboxylate in all monocarboxylate substrates ( Figure 4 E). In addition to the polar interactions between the carboxylate group of BAY-8002 with Lys38, Ser154, Asp309, Arg313, and Ser371 of MCT1, the three aromatic rings of the inhibitor are encompassed by Tyr34, Leu66, Phe278, Leu281, Val282, and Phe367 ( Figure 4 E).
In the inward-open structure, resolution of 7ACC2 is lower than that for BAY-8002. Nevertheless, its aromatic rings are discernible in a U-shape ( Figure 4 F). The coumarin ring and benzyl ring of 7ACC2 appear to pack against Tyr34 and Tyr70, respectively, and the carboxylate group is placed in the hydrophilic pocket constituted by Lys38, Ser154, Asp309, Arg313, and S371 ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Location of the carboxyl group of 7ACC2 may reflect the mode of substrate coordination in the inward-open state ( Figures 4 F and 4G).
MCT1A can be superimposed to MCT1L with an RMSD of 0.66 Å over 356 aligned Cα atoms ( Figure S6 A). The Y-shaped AZD3965 comprises three ring structures, the thienopyrimidine-2,4-dione ring, the pyrazol ring, and the isoxazolidinyl ring, all of which are well-resolved. The largest thienopyrimidine-2,4-dione ring stands in a big cleft between the NTD and CTD, while the other two rings project into two smaller pockets slightly above ( Figure 5 A).
The central thienopyrimidine-2,4-dione ring is coordinated by Tyr34, Tyr70, Arg313, and Phe367 through both hydrophobic and polar interactions. Tyr34 and Phe367 are positioned on the opposite sides of the pyrimidine plane, and Arg313 forms two H bonds with the 4-carbonyl group ( Figures 5 B and 5C). The pyrazol ring, which has a trifluoromethyl group, is nestled in a hydrophobic cavity constituted by Lys38, Leu66, Phe278, and Leu281 ( Figures 5 B and 5C). The isoxazolidinyl ring interacts with Pro155 and uses its 4-hydroxyl group to form a H-bond with Asp309 ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Compared to the structure of MCT1L, the side chains of Lys38 and Phe367 swing away to avoid collision with AZD3965 ( Figures S6 B and S6C).
To validate the structural observations, we sought to examine the inhibitory effect of AZD3965 on MCT1 variants, each containing a single point substitution of some of the aforementioned residues. Because of the overlapping binding site, most of the tested mutations affected the transport activity of MCT1 ( Figure S6 D). We then used microscale thermophoresis (MST) to measure the binding affinity of AZD3965 and the MCT1 variants ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Consistent with the structural analysis, Y70A, D309A, and R313A resulted in undetectable binding between AZD3965 and MCT1 ( Figure 5 E, Figure S6 E), and L66A and P155A weakened the interaction by approximately 15 and 45 folds, respectively. F278A only slightly affects the interaction, whereas K38A retains similar affinity ( Figures 5 D and 5E).
AZD3965 is known to selectively inhibit MCT1/2, but not MCT4. The structure of MCT1A affords the opportunity to investigate the molecular determinant for the selectivity. Sequence alignment shows that Tyr34, Lys38, Leu66, Tyr70, Pro155, Phe278, Asp309, and Arg313 are conserved among MCT1-4, whereas Met151 on TM5, Leu281 on TM7, and Phe367 and Ser371 on TM10 are replaced by Ala, Pro, Tyr, and Gly, respectively, in MCT4 ( Figures 6 A and 6B).
Substitution of Leu281, which interacts with the pyrazol and isoxazolidinyl groups of AZD3965, with Pro (Pro246 in MCT4) may lead to loss of this important hydrophobic contact ( Figure 6 C), while addition of a hydroxyl group to Phe367 (Tyr332 in MCT4) can result in clash with the pyrimidine plane of AZD3965 ( Figure 6 D). Met151 → Ala or Ser371 → Gly (Ala153 and Gly336 in MCT4) may also weaken the interactions of MCT1 with the pyrimidine plane of AZD3965 ( Figure 6 D).
To test these analyses, four MCT1 variants, M151A, L281P, F367Y, and S371G, were generated and their responses to AZD3965 were examined using both counterflow assay and MST. Indeed, AZD3965 no longer inhibited the transport activity of MCT1-L281P, and the affinity was reduced by ∼55 folds to ∼2.28 μM ( Figures 6 E and 6F). MCT1-F367Y only had residual transport activity, no longer suitable for the inhibition assay ( Figure 6 E). MST measurement showed a reduced affinity to ∼1.76 μM ( Figure 6 F). AZD3965 inhibition of MCT1-M151A and MCT1-S371G were weakened by approximately 2 folds, whereas the affinities were decreased by ∼10 folds ( Figures 6 E and 6F). These results support that alteration of these four residues underlies the subtype-specificity for AZD3965 response.

Section: Discussion

MCT1 is a well-established drug target for the treatment of cancer ( Pérez-Escuredo et al., 2016 42. Pérez-Escuredo, J. ∙ Van Hée, V.F. ∙ Sboarina, M. ... Monocarboxylate transporters in the brain and in cancer Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 :2481-2497 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our cryo-EM structures of MCT1 in complex with different small molecule ligands exemplify the power of cryo-EM for drug discovery. Many physiologically and pathophysiologically important SLC proteins are challenging targets for cryo-EM analysis because of their relatively low molecular weight and high mobility. The reported SLCs whose structures were determined by cryo-EM either have rigid and bulky soluble domains or bind stably to antibodies or nanobodies ( Coleman et al., 2019 8. Coleman, J.A. ∙ Yang, D. ∙ Zhao, Z. ... Serotonin transporter-ibogaine complexes illuminate mechanisms of inhibition and transport Nature. 2019; 569 :141-145 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2019 29. Kim, J. ∙ Tan, Y.Z. ∙ Wicht, K.J. ... Structure and drug resistance of the Plasmodium falciparum transporter PfCRT Nature. 2019; 576 :315-320 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2019 31. Lee, Y. ∙ Wiriyasermkul, P. ∙ Jin, C. ... Cryo-EM structure of the human L-type amino acid transporter 1 in complex with glycoprotein CD98hc Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :510-517 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2019 65. Yan, R. ∙ Zhao, X. ∙ Lei, J. ... Structure of the human LAT1-4F2hc heteromeric amino acid transporter complex Nature. 2019; 568 :127-130 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our strategy developed for the cryo-EM analysis of the MCT1/Basigin-2 complex, which only has thirteen TM segments and a flexible ECD, may be generalized to facilitate structural elucidation of non-homooligomeric SLCs or other small-size membrane proteins.
The structures of human MCT1/Basigin-2 complex bound to representative substrate and inhibitors provide important insight into the working and inhibition mechanism of MCTs. We show that substrate translocation is achieved through rigid-body rotation of the two domains that exposes the central substrate binding sites alternatingly to either side of the membrane ( Figure 7 A). Protonation and deprotonation of Asp309 is essential for the conformational transition. The structure of MCT1N trapped in the inward-open state also explains the loss of function of D309N in our counterflow assay, because the variant can no longer complete an alternating access cycle.
The MCT1 inhibitors, AZD3965, BAY-8002, 7ACC2, lock MCT1 in distinct conformations, outward- or inward-open. Nevertheless, all three inhibitors directly occupy the substrate binding site ( Figure 7 B). Therefore, they achieve inhibition of MCT1 all through direct competition with substrate binding and suppression of conformational changes of the transporter. Our structure-guided biochemical analyses also reveal the determinants for subtype-specific sensitivities of MCT1 and MCT4 to the inhibitor AZD3965. It is noted that MCT3 also has altered sequence for the identified residues, consistent with its insensitivity to AZD3965 ( Curtis et al., 2017 11. Curtis, N.J. ∙ Mooney, L. ∙ Hopcroft, L. ... Pre-clinical pharmacology of AZD3965, a selective inhibitor of MCT1: DLBCL, NHL and Burkitt’s lymphoma anti-tumor activity Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :69219-69236 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Structural comparison reveals major differences between MCT1 and the outward-facing bacterial homolog SfMCT ( Figure S7 A) ( Bosshart et al., 2019 4. Bosshart, P.D. ∙ Kalbermatter, D. ∙ Bonetti, S. ... Mechanistic basis of L-lactate transport in the SLC16 solute carrier family Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2649 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite a similar position for the substrate binding site, most of the residues constituting the pocket and the transport path are not conserved. Two substrate binding sites are observed in SfMCT, but only the central one is observed in our MCT1 structure, while the extracellular one is blocked by Lys38 ( Figure S7 B). Substantial deviations in the ligand orientation and coordination residues are also observed between the MCT1A structure and the predicted model of AR-C15585-bound rat MCT1 in the inward-facing state ( Nancolas et al., 2015 35. Nancolas, B. ∙ Sessions, R.B. ∙ Halestrap, A.P. Identification of key binding site residues of MCT1 for AR-C155858 reveals the molecular basis of its isoform selectivity Biochem. J. 2015; 467 :192 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our purification profile and cryo-EM structure of MCT1-Basigin complex both suggest the assembly of a 1:1 heterodimer. However, the recent structure of inward-open MCT2 reveals a homodimeric organization ( Figure S7 C). Although each MCT2 protomer can be superimposed to MCT1C with RMSD of 1.12 Å over 300 Cα atoms, pronounced local shifts are found in the N-terminal half of TM5, which rotates by ∼30° toward the central tunnel in MCT2 ( Figures S7 D and S7E). The residues constituting the substrate binding pocket are conserved between MCT1 and MCT2, and minor local changes occur to Tyr70, Tyr34, and Arg313 that may be caused by 7ACC2 binding to MCT1 ( Figure S7 F).
Taken together, the structures of lactate-bound WT MCT1 at pH 8.0 in the outward conformation and MCT1(D309N) in the inward-open states reveal the molecular basis for substrate recognition and transport mechanism, and establish the framework for future biophysical and molecular dynamics simulation analyses. The structures of MCT1 in complex with three representative drug candidates elucidate the MOA of these inhibitors and lay the foundation for future drug discovery targeting MCT1-4.

The corresponding electron microscopy maps have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/ ), under the accession codes EMD-30020, EMD-30019, EMD-30391, EMD-30389 and EMD-30623, respectively.
All E. coli cells were cultured in LB medium (Sigma) at 37°C. The E. coli strain DH5α were used to generate and amplify plasmids for MCT1 and Basigin-2 variants and strain DH10Bac cells were used to generate bacmids.
Sf9 cells (GIBCO) were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (GIBCO) at 27°C. The baculoviruses were generated and amplified in Sf-9 insect cells in Sf-900 II SFM medium supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO) and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). Bacmid transfection was carried out using Cellfectin II Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
The cDNAs of full-length human MCT1 (UniProt ID: P53985 ) and Basigin-2 (UniProt ID: P35613-2) were cloned individually into pFastBac vector (Invitrogen). MCT1 was fused with a C-terminal 6 × His-tag and Basigin-2 was fused with a C-terminal Strep-tag. All mutants were generated with a standard PCR-based strategy.
Following the instructions for the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen), bacmids were generated in DH10Bac cells. The baculoviruses were generated and amplified in Sf-9 insect cells. The two P3 baculoviruses were added at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 (v/v) at a cell density of 1.5∼2 × 10 6 cells per ml.
For protein expression and purification, the Sf-9 cells were collected 72 h after viral infection, resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors (aprotinin at 0.8 μM, pepstatin at 2 μM, and leupeptin at 5 μg/mL; Amresco) and solubilized with 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM, Anatrace) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. After centrifugation at 20,000 g for 1 h, the supernatant was incubated with nickel affinity resin (Ni-NTA, QIAGEN) at 4°C for 1 h. The resin was then washed with the wash buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, and 0.02% (w/v) glyco-diosgenin (GDN, Anatrace). The protein was eluted with the wash buffer plus 270 mM imidazole. The eluent was then applied to desalting column (HiTrap Desalting Columns, GE Healthcare) to remove the excess imidazole before loading to Strep-Tactin resin (Iba). After being washed with the buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) GDN, the protein was eluted by wash buffer plus 5 mM desthiobiotin (Iba). The protein was then concentrated and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-200, GE Healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated in the buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) GDN. Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to 5 mg/mL for cryo-EM analysis.
For counterflow assay and MST measurements, 0.02 (w/v) DDM, instead of 0.02% (w/v) GDN, was used for protein purification.
E. coli polar lipids (Avanti) supplemented with 20% (wt%) cholesterol were dissolved at a concentration of 20 mg/mL in methanol:chloroform (1:3, v/v) and dried with nitrogen gas. The lipids were resuspended at a concentration of 20 mg/mL with the KPM 5.5 buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 2 mM MgSO 4 ; pH 5.5) supplemented with 5 mM sodium L-lactate or 50 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma). After 10 cycles of freeze-and-thaw by liquid nitrogen, the liposomes were extruded through 0.4 μm polycarbonate membranes (Millipore) for 21 times.
The liposomes were pre-incubated with 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (β-OG; Anatrace) for 30 min at 4°C before protein insertion. The tested protein was incubated with liposomes for 60 min at a ratio of ∼1:100 (w/w). Then, β-OG was removed by incubation overnight with 260 mg/mL Bio-Beads SM2 (Bio-Rad), and the resulting solution was further incubated with 90 mg/mL Bio-Beads for an additional h. The proteoliposomes were homogenized by 5 freeze-and-thaw cycles, extruded through membrane filters, collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g at 4°C for 1 h, and rinsed twice with ice cold KPM 5.5 buffer. The proteoliposomes were resuspended in KPM 5.5 buffer to a final concentration of 100 mg/mL.
For each assay, 2 μL of aforementioned proteoliposomes were added into 100 μL KPM 5.5 buffer plus 0.1 μCi of L-[ 14 C(U)] sodium lactate or 0.1 μCi of [1- 14 C] sodium pyruvate (PerkinElmer).
The final concentration of the external L-[ 14 C(U)] sodium lactate is 6.4 μM and the final concentration of the [1- 14 C] sodium pyruvate was 130 μM. Uptake of radio-labeled substrates was terminated at 1 min by rapidly filtering the solution through 0.22 μm GSTF filters (Millipore) and washed with 2.5 mL KPM 5.5 buffer. The filter was then solubilized with 0.5 mL Optiphase HISAFE 3 (PerkinElmer) and used for liquid scintillation counting with MicroBeta JET (PerkinElmer). Liposomes without protein were used as negative control.
All counter-flow assays were performed at 25°C and repeated at least three times. Error bars represent SD The data for liposome-based transport assay were all analyzed by GraphPad Prism.
MST measurements were conducted on a Monolith NT. Label-free instrument (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH) with 20% LED power and 60% MST power. Purified proteins (MCT1/Basigin-2 WT and other mutations) were diluted in the MST buffer containing 25 mM Tris 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) DDM. Inhibitors with serial dilution were mixed with MCT1/Basigin-2 variants. The mixture was incubated overnight at 18°C before measurement.
MCT1 (wild type or N178A variant) with a 6 × His-tag and Basigin-2 with a Strep-tag were coexpressed and extracted as aforementioned protocol. The supernatant of high-speed centrifugation was prepared for two copies and applied to nickel affinity resin (pull down His-tag) or Strep-Tactin resin (pull down Strep-tag), respectively. Elution were applied to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by bloting to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). MCT1 was labeled by mouse anti-His antibody (CWbiotech). Basigin-2 was labeled by goat anti-Basigin antibody (R&D Systems). Quantification of protein bands was visualized by western blot mode of ChemiDoc XRS+ (Bio-Rad) using the software Image Lab.
The purified MCT1/Basigin-2 complexes were concentrated to approximately 5 mg/mL and separately incubated with 50 mM lactate (MCT1L and MCT1N), 600 μM AZD3965 (MCT1A), BAY-8002 (MCT1B), or 7ACC2 (MCT1C) for 30 min before being applied to the grids. The inhibitors were purchased from MedChemExpress. Aliquots (3.5 μl) of the protein complex were placed on glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh). The grids were blotted for 3.0 s and flash-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen with Vitrobot (Mark IV, Thermo Fisher Scientific) before being transferred to a Titan Krios operating at 300 kV and equipped with Gatan K2 or K3 Summit detector and a GIF Quantum energy filter (slit width 20 eV). Micrographs of MCT1L/A/B/C/N were recorded in the super-resolution mode with a calibrated pixel size of 0.544 Å, 0.546 Å, 0.422 Å, 0.422 Å and 0.422 Å, respectively. Each stack of 32 frames was exposed for 8 s, with an exposing time of 0.25 s per frame. The total dose rate was about 4.7 e - /sec/Å 2 for each stack. AutoEMation was used for the fully automated data collection ( Lei and Frank, 2005 32. Lei, J. ∙ Frank, J. Automated acquisition of cryo-electron micrographs for single particle reconstruction on an FEI Tecnai electron microscope J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 150 :69-80 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). All 32 frames in each stack were aligned and summed using the whole-image motion correction program MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 69. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ) and binned to a pixel size of 1.087 Å, 1.091 Å, 0.843, 0.843 or 0.843 Å for MCT1L/A/B/C/N, respectively. The defocus value of each image, which was set from −1.5 to −2.0 μm during data collection, was determined by Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 66. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For MCT1A dataset, 5,148,843 particles were automatically picked by Gautomatch (developed by Kai Zhang, https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/locally-developed-software/zhang-software/#gauto ) from 10,645 micrographs. Two rounds of 2D classification were performed using RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 70. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a small subset of the selected particles from 2D classification were used to generate the initial model by RELION 3.0. A good reference of low resolution and five bad references were generated using conventional 3D classifications to perform the next-step “guided multi-reference classification” ( Zhang et al., 2017 67. Zhang, X. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Hang, J. ... An Atomic Structure of the Human Spliceosome Cell. 2017; 169 :918-929 e914 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three parallel runs of guided multi-reference global 3D classification were performed. Following a previously described protocol ( Yan et al., 2016 64. Yan, C. ∙ Wan, R. ∙ Bai, R. ... Structure of a yeast activated spliceosome at 3.5 Å resolution Science. 2016; 353 :904-911 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ), particles from the best classes were merged and duplicated particles were removed, resulting in a dataset of 1,743,963 particles ( Figures S2 A and S3 A). Attempts to further improve the reconstruction through 3D classification and auto-refinement using different soft masks failed to converge due to strong noise in the micelle region and the flexible extracellular domain that accounts for ∼24% of the molecular weight of the 85-kD complex. The resolution was stuck at around 15 Å at this stage.
Detailed inspection of the cryo-EM density suggests that strong noise from the large micelle and weak signal from the 13 TM helices are the main obstacles for obtaining a high resolution cryo-EM reconstruction. We speculated that noise elimination and recovery of the weak signal of the TM region would be important to EM analysis of the small membrane protein complex. To achieve a better balance between noise and signal, we developed a strategy that reduced the strong noise outside the TM region. First, a noise map was extracted from the low-resolution reconstruction by multiplying a reversed TM mask that excluded the TM region ( Figure S1 C). Second, an empirical threshold was set in the noise map for mask creating using RELION ( Zivanov et al., 2018 70. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ) and only noisy regions of density higher than this threshold was included, yielding a noise mask. We rescaled the maximal value of the noise mask by a factor around 0.3-0.8 and multiplied it to the noise map. This step generated a density outside the TM region with strongly downscaled noise, which is termed as strong noise-reduced noise map by us. Finally, the strong noise-reduced noise map was subtracted from the original map. Through the aforementioned three steps, we were able to create a noise-reweighted map, in which the strong noise outside the TM region was reduced by 30 ∼80 percent while other regions in the cryo-EM map remained unchanged ( Figure S1 C).
It is noteworthy that the strong noises accumulated through the iterative refinement process can be selectively reduced based on intensity by using different thresholds to specify the noisy regions and create corresponding masks. At the same time, specified strong noises can be reduced to any extent by adjusting the additional scale factor ( Figure S1 D). For example, in the low-resolution alignment stage, the noises may be very strong, a low threshold and a large-scale factor can be applied to remove as much noise as possible. After reaching a relatively high resolution, a higher threshold and a smaller scale factor can be adapted to slightly reduce the noisy regions. Integrating this noise reduction process into the refinement procedure, noises from the micelle were reduced and rod-like density likely belonging to the TM segments emerged after iterative refinement ( Figure S1 E). We performed mask creation and map operations using commands from RELION ( Zivanov et al., 2018 70. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Three iterations of local alignment by 3D classification (class number K = 1) combined with the de-noising procedure was performed for the 1,743,963 particles with the pixel size of 2.18 Å, resulting in a 6 Å map with clear TM helices ( Figure S3 A). After additional rounds of guided multi-reference classification, in which the 6 Å map served as the good reference, 1,095,940 particles were selected and subjected to one round of local 3D refinement (K = 1) combined with noise reduction, yielding a reconstruction at around 4.5 Å resolution ( Figure S3 A). This set of particles and map was applied to CRYOSPARC for an additional round of refinement, generating a suitable volume as the accurate reference for data re-processing in CRYOSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 49. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Five rounds of guided multi-reference classification was performed for the 5,148,843 raw particles of MCT1A dataset using CRYOSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 49. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ), during which the good reference used in all the classifications was updated with a better one whenever possible. A total of 474,264 good particles were selected, re-centered, and re-extracted using a pixel size of 1.09 Å by RELION. After 3 additional rounds of guided multi-reference 3D classification and Non-Uniform refinement, 190,753 particles gave rise to a reconstruction at an average resolution of 3.6 Å ( Figure S3 B).
To further improve the resolution, we developed a “seed” facilitated 3D classification and CTF refinement strategy ( Figures S2 B and S2C), as conventional 3D classification of small membrane proteins is not as efficient as of large ones. To improve the performance of 3D classification, the raw particles were divided into subgroups and combined with the “seed” particles, which were selected from previous good results. The particle number in each subgroup is close to that of the seed particles. Several rounds of guided multi-reference 3D classification were performed on the combined particle subsets. Since the seed particles may dominate the 3D classification, a better classification result can be expected. Redundancy of the particles was avoided by CRYOSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 49. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ) during data processing. A total of 1,894,335 particles were selected from the seed-facilitated 3D classification ( Figure S3 B). However, auto-refinement of this dataset did not work as well as expected. A seed-facilitated CTF refinement was then applied with the reconstruction produced from the seed particles. This procedure corrected the CTF values in advance and produced a better result. After the optimized procedure for data processing, the dataset of MCT1A gave rise to a reconstruction at the resolution of 3.2 Å.
For the MCT1L, MCT1B, MCT1C and MCT1N datasets, a similar procedure was applied and 843,599, 494,077, 533,887 and 648,305 good particles yielded reconstructions at 3.3 Å, 3.0 Å, 3.0 Å and 3.3 Å for the TM region, respectively ( Figure S3 B; Table S1 ). For the MCT1L dataset, the 843,599 particles selected from CRYOSPARC were further refined by RELION with an overall mask to recover the densities representing the lactate molecule that may be eliminated by the automated local SNR filtering or dynamic masking procedures in CRYOSPARC.
For the dataset of MCT1/Basigin-2 complex at pH 6.0, good references of outward-open and inward-open states were applied separately during 3D classification. After Non-Uniform refinement with initial resolution of 30 Å, the resolution of outward-open and inward-open states reached to 7.2 Å and 6.6 Å, respectively.
The angular distributions of the particles used for the final reconstruction of the MCT1/Basigin-2 complex are reasonable ( Figures S4 B, S4E, S4H, S4K, and S4N).
The atomic coordinate of the MCT1/Basigin-2 complex was generated by combining homology modeling and de novo model building. An initial structure model for MCT1 was predicted by protein structure prediction web server I-TASSER ( Roy et al., 2010 52. Roy, A. ∙ Kucukural, A. ∙ Zhang, Y. I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5 :725-738 Crossref Scopus (5090) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure was docked into the density map and manually adjusted and re-built by COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 19. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25430) PubMed Google Scholar ). Crystal structure of extracellular domain of Basigin-2 ( Wright et al., 2014 62. Wright, K.E. ∙ Hjerrild, K.A. ∙ Bartlett, J. ... Structure of malaria invasion protein RH5 with erythrocyte basigin and blocking antibodies Nature. 2014; 515 :427-430 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB code: 4U0Q ) was used and fitted into the density. 3D Structures and restraint files for all three inhibitors were generated by SKETCHER program in CCP4 suite ( Collaborative Computational Project, 1994 9. Collaborative Computational Project The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50 :760-763 Crossref Scopus (19984) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The model of trans-membrane region of MCT1/Basigin-2 complex in the present of lactate or inhibitors was refined against the corresponding map using PHENIX ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1519) PubMed Google Scholar ) in real space with secondary structure and geometry restraints. Overfitting of model was monitored by refining the model in one of the two independent maps from the gold-standard refinement approach, and testing the refined model against the other map ( Amunts et al., 2014 2. Amunts, A. ∙ Brown, A. ∙ Bai, X.C. ... Structure of the yeast mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit Science. 2014; 343 :1485-1489 Crossref Scopus (464) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S4 C, S4F, S4I, S4L, and S4O). The structures of the MCT1/Basigin-2 complexes were validated through examination of the Molprobity scores and statistics of the Ramachandran plots ( Table S1 ). Molprobity scores were calculated as described ( Davis et al., 2007 12. Davis, I.W. ∙ Leaver-Fay, A. ∙ Chen, V.B. ... MolProbity: all-atom contacts and structure validation for proteins and nucleic acids Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :W375-83 Crossref Scopus (3203) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The local resolution map was calculated using RELION 3.0 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 70. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Resolutions were estimated with the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation 0.143 criterion ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 51. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1612) PubMed Google Scholar ) with high-resolution noise substitution. Statistical analysis of counterflow assay was performed using Prism 8 for Windows Ver. 8.0 (GraphPad). Data are expressed as mean ± SD MST datasets were processed with the MO. Affinity Analysis v2.2.4 software (Nano Temper Technologies GmbH). Data represent mean ± SEM of three independent measurements.
