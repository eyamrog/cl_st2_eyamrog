Title: Targeting Mitochondria-Located circRNA SCAR Alleviates NASH via Reducing mROS Output


Abstract: Summary

Mitochondria, which play central roles in immunometabolic diseases, have their own genome. However, the functions of mitochondria-located noncoding RNAs are largely unknown due to the absence of a specific delivery system. By circular RNA (circRNA) expression profile analysis of liver fibroblasts from patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we observe that mitochondrial circRNAs account for a considerable fraction of downregulated circRNAs in NASH fibroblasts. By constructing mitochondria-targeting nanoparticles, we observe that Steatohepatitis-associated circRNA ATP5B Regulator (SCAR), which is located in mitochondria, inhibits mitochondrial ROS (mROS) output and fibroblast activation. circRNA SCAR, mediated by PGC-1α, binds to ATP5B and shuts down mPTP by blocking CypD-mPTP interaction. Lipid overload inhibits PGC-1α by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced CHOP. In vivo , targeting circRNA SCAR alleviates high fat diet-induced cirrhosis and insulin resistance. Clinically, circRNA SCAR is associated with steatosis-to-NASH progression. Collectively, we identify a mitochondrial circRNA that drives metaflammation and serves as a therapeutic target for NASH.

Section: Introduction

Immunometabolic diseases emerge as one of the biggest public health challenges due to the adoption of a high-calorie diet and sedentary lifestyle worldwide ( Christ and Latz, 2019 12. Christ, A. ∙ Latz, E. The Western lifestyle has lasting effects on metaflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :267-268 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Metaflammation is a hallmark of immunometabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes, and obesity ( Franceschi et al., 2018 19. Franceschi, C. ∙ Garagnani, P. ∙ Parini, P. ... Inflammaging: a new immune-metabolic viewpoint for age-related diseases Nat. Rev.

Inflammation, metaflammation and immunometabolic disorders Nature. 2017; 542 :177-185 Crossref Scopus (1419) PubMed Google Scholar ). NASH is a progressive type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which affects ~25% of the world population and is closely associated with other immunometabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia ( Neuschwander-Tetri, 2017 61. Neuschwander-Tetri, B.A. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease BMC Med. 2017; 15 :45 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ; Younossi et al., 2018 89. Younossi, Z. ∙ Anstee, Q.M. ∙ Marietti, M. ... Global burden of NAFLD and NASH: trends, predictions, risk factors and prevention Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 15 :11-20 Crossref Scopus (3399) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, to meet this important challenge of global health, there is a pressing need to elucidate how metabolic disorder is transited to uncontrollable inflammation ( Friedman et al., 2018 20. Friedman, S.L. ∙ Neuschwander-Tetri, B.A. ∙ Rinella, M. ... Mechanisms of NAFLD development and therapeutic strategies Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :908-922 Crossref Scopus (2347) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mitochondria are not only bioenergetic factories, but also dynamic nexus to coordinate signaling networks by releasing metabolic by-products ( Rambold and Pearce, 2018 66.

Mitochondrial ROS signaling in organismal homeostasis Cell. 2015; 163 :560-569 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ). These signaling molecules dictate immune cell fate ( Mehta et al., 2017 57. Mehta, M.M. ∙ Weinberg, S.E. ∙ Chandel, N.S. Mitochondrial control of immunity: beyond ATP Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :608-620 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, mROS is required for optimal activation of T cells ( Sena et al., 2013 73.

Mitochondria are required for antigen-specific T cell activation through reactive oxygen species signaling Immunity. 2013; 38 :225-236 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ), B cells ( Capasso et al., 2010 6.

Succinate Dehydrogenase Supports Metabolic Repurposing of Mitochondria to Drive Inflammatory Macrophages Cell. 2016; 167 :457-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fibroblasts are the major source of collagen as well as many cytokines ( Kalluri, 2016 38. Kalluri, R. The biology and function of fibroblasts in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :582-598 Crossref Scopus (2713) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite its central position in fibrosis and inflammation, how mitochondrial signals regulate its functions remains elusive.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs), covalently closed at the 5′ and 3′ end, are more resistant to exonucleases than linear RNAs ( Chen, 2016 8. Chen, L.L.

A 360° view of circular RNAs: From biogenesis to functions Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2018; 9 :e1478 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). circRNAs act through diverse mechanisms, including interaction with microRNAs or proteins, regulation of transcription and splicing, and translation into peptides ( Lasda and Parker, 2014 45. Lasda, E. ∙ Parker, R. Circular RNAs: diversity of form and function RNA. 2014; 20 :1829-1842 Crossref Scopus (965) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilusz, 2018 84. Wilusz, J.E. A 360° view of circular RNAs: From biogenesis to functions Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2018; 9 :e1478 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mitochondria contain a maternally inherited, 16.5-kb circular genome that encodes for 13 oxidative phosphorylation complex subunits, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs. Although circRNAs specifically transcribed by mitochondrial DNA have been identified ( Jeck et al., 2013 35. Jeck, W.R. ∙ Sorrentino, J.A. ∙ Wang, K. ... Circular RNAs are abundant, conserved, and associated with ALU repeats RNA. 2013; 19 :141-157 Crossref Scopus (3359) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2019b 52. Liu, X. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Li, J. ...

Cell-type specific features of circular RNA expression PLoS Genet. 2013; 9 :e1003777 Crossref Scopus (1598) PubMed Google Scholar ), the functions of mitochondria-located circRNAs are largely unknown due to the presence of double mitochondrial membranes and the absence of mitochondria-specific circRNA delivery system. Here, we investigate the role of mitochondria-located circRNAs in metaflammation.

Section: Results

Fibroblasts orchestrate fibrosis in multiple diseases. Among them, NAFLD affects 25% of the global population ( Younossi et al., 2018 89. Younossi, Z. ∙ Anstee, Q.M. ∙ Marietti, M. ... Global burden of NAFLD and NASH: trends, predictions, risk factors and prevention Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 15 :11-20 Crossref Scopus (3399) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate the mitochondrial metabolism of fibroblasts in NAFLD patients, we isolated fibroblasts from liver tissues of patients with NASH cirrhosis and those without NAFLD ( Su et al., 2018 77. Su, S. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yao, H. ... CD10(+)GPR77(+) Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer Stemness Cell. 2018; 172 :841-856 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar ; Su et al., 2015 76. Su, S. ∙ Zhao, Q. ∙ He, C. ... miR-142-5p and miR-130a-3p are regulated by IL-4 and IL-13 and control profibrogenic macrophage program Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8523 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer, we observed that both extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) increased in NASH fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts ( Figure 1 A). However, the ECAR/OCR ratio was significantly elevated in NASH fibroblasts ( Figure 1 B). Consistently, the ECAR/OCR ratio was greatly enhanced in normal fibroblasts treated with palmitate ( Figure 1 C), which recapitulates lipid exposure in vitro ( Machado et al., 2015 54. Machado, M.V. ∙ Michelotti, G.A. ∙ Pereira, Tde.A. ... Reduced lipoapoptosis, hedgehog pathway activation and fibrosis in caspase-2 deficient mice with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Gut. 2015; 64 :1148-1157 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, palmitate treatment slightly increased the apoptosis of fibroblasts ( Figure S1 A). Together, these data suggested that ATP production in fibroblasts switches from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis under lipid burden.
Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) generated by proton pumps of the electron transport chain is required for ATP production. Therefore, we evaluated ΔΨm by JC-1 fluorescence and found that ΔΨm in NASH fibroblasts was markedly lower ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Electronic microscopy demonstrated that the ΔΨm suppression was accompanied by the swelling of the mitochondria ( Figure 1 F), indicating mitochondrial stress. ROS often increases in mitochondrial stress ( Shadel and Horvath, 2015 74. Shadel, G.S. ∙ Horvath, T.L. Mitochondrial ROS signaling in organismal homeostasis Cell. 2015; 163 :560-569 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we evaluated both mROS and cytosolic ROS (cROS) using two approaches, including fluorescent dyes MitoSOX and DCFH-DA ( West et al., 2011 82. West, A.P. ∙ Brodsky, I.E. ∙ Rahner, C. ... TLR signalling augments macrophage bactericidal activity through mitochondrial ROS Nature. 2011; 472 :476-480 Crossref Scopus (1219) PubMed Google Scholar ), and transduction with compartment-specific ROS sensors mitoORP and cytoORP, respectively ( Dey et al., 2018 15. Dey, S. ∙ DeMazumder, D. ∙ Sidor, A. ... Mitochondrial ROS Drive Sudden Cardiac Death and Chronic Proteome Remodeling in Heart Failure Circ. Res. 2018; 123 :356-371 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). In parallel to ΔΨm suppression, both mROS and cROS significantly increased in NASH fibroblasts ( Figures 1 G–1J). Similarly, palmitate exposure markedly increased mROS and cROS levels ( Figures S1 B and S1C). mROS can be released into the cytosol via mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which is an important source of cROS ( Dey et al., 2018 15. Dey, S. ∙ DeMazumder, D. ∙ Sidor, A. ... Mitochondrial ROS Drive Sudden Cardiac Death and Chronic Proteome Remodeling in Heart Failure Circ. Res. 2018; 123 :356-371 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kwong and Molkentin, 2015 43. Kwong, J.Q. ∙ Molkentin, J.D. Physiological and pathological roles of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the heart Cell Metab. 2015; 21 :206-214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, administration of mPTP inhibitors (cyclosporine A) significantly reduced cROS levels in both NASH fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts treated with palmitate ( Figures S1 D and S1E). These data suggested that fibroblasts with lipid exposure exhibit mitochondrial stress with elevated mROS production and efflux into cytosol.
Although ROS is required for optimal activation of multiple immune cells ( Mills et al., 2017 60. Mills, E.L. ∙ Kelly, B. ∙ O’Neill, L.A.J. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of immunity Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :488-498 Crossref Scopus (655) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sena et al., 2013 73. Sena, L.A. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Jairaman, A. ... Mitochondria are required for antigen-specific T cell activation through reactive oxygen species signaling Immunity. 2013; 38 :225-236 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ), whether ROS mediates fibroblast activation remains unclear. To address this, we treated primary NASH fibroblasts with ROS inhibitors and observed that the contractility ( Figure 1 K), collagen synthesis, and α-SMA expression ( Figure 1 L) were abrogated. Moreover, ROS inhibition attenuated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines ( Figure 1 M). Again, ROS blockade abolished the pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory functions of palmitate-treated fibroblasts ( Figures S1 F and S1G). Collectively, these results suggested that lipid accumulation increases mROS output, which promotes fibroblast activation.
circRNAs are key signaling regulators in multiple cell types ( Li et al., 2018 47. Li, X. ∙ Yang, L. ∙ Chen, L.L. The Biogenesis, Functions, and Challenges of Circular RNAs Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :428-442 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1378) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the roles of circRNAs in fibroblasts are elusive. Thus, we compared the circRNA expression profiles between primary fibroblasts isolated from 4 patients with NASH cirrhosis and 4 patients without NAFLD. 15 and 11 circRNAs were consistently upregulated and downregulated respectively in NASH fibroblasts ( Figures 2 A and S2 A–S2C). Strikingly, a large fraction of (4 out of 11) downregulated circRNAs were encoded by the mitochondrial genome ( Figure 2 B), despite nuclear circRNAs accounting for an overwhelming majority of the whole circRNomics ( Figure S2 D) ( Jeck et al., 2013 35. Jeck, W.R. ∙ Sorrentino, J.A. ∙ Wang, K. ... Circular RNAs are abundant, conserved, and associated with ALU repeats RNA. 2013; 19 :141-157 Crossref Scopus (3359) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among them, the suppression of 3 mitochondrial circRNAs (mito-circRNAs) in NASH patients was validated by qRT-PCR in another cohort consisting of 18 patients with NASH cirrhosis and 20 patients without NAFLD ( Figure 2 C). The fractionation experiment demonstrated that these circRNAs were mainly located in the mitochondria rather than the cytosol ( Figure 2 D). Divergent PCR followed by sequencing analysis demonstrated that these 3 mito-circRNAs are all generated from the mitochondrial genome through “backsplices” mechanism ( Figure S2 E). The mature transcripts all contain exonic sequences despite hsa_circ_0089763 having an intron retained between exons. Among them, hsa_circ_0089762 and hsa_circ_0089763 are generated from the light strand of mito-DNA, while hsa_circ_0008882 is generated from the heavy strand ( Figure 2 E).
To investigate these mito-circRNAs, we constructed a mitochondria-targeting nanoparticle (mito-NP) platform. The mito-NP platform contained an endosomal pH-responsive polymer, which can be protonated under the endosomal acid microenvironment, thereby releasing the complexes from endosomes after cellular uptake as we previously reported ( Xu et al., 2016 86. Xu, X. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Ultra-pH-Responsive and Tumor-Penetrating Nanoplatform for Targeted siRNA Delivery with Robust Anti-Cancer Efficacy Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55 :7091-7094 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 87. Xu, X. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Multifunctional Envelope-Type siRNA Delivery Nanoparticle Platform for Prostate Cancer Therapy ACS Nano. 2017; 11 :2618-2627 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, it consisted of encapsulated circRNA-expressing vectors ( Han et al., 2017 28. Han, D. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Wang, H. ... Circular RNA circMTO1 acts as the sponge of microRNA-9 to suppress hepatocellular carcinoma progression Hepatology. 2017; 66 :1151-1164 Crossref Scopus (946) PubMed Google Scholar ) and triphenylphosphonium (TPP)-decorated amphiphilic cationic peptides (TACP), which specifically deliver encapsulated vectors to the mitochondria ( Chouchani et al., 2013 11. Chouchani, E.T. ∙ Methner, C. ∙ Nadtochiy, S.M. ... Cardioprotection by S-nitrosation of a cysteine switch on mitochondrial complex I Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :753-759 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zielonka et al., 2017 93. Zielonka, J. ∙ Joseph, J. ∙ Sikora, A. ... Mitochondria-Targeted Triphenylphosphonium-Based Compounds: Syntheses, Mechanisms of Action, and Therapeutic and Diagnostic Applications Chem. Rev. 2017; 117 :10043-10120 Crossref Scopus (1041) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 F). The size and zeta potential of the mito-NP were determined using dynamic light scattering, and the encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of the circRNA-expressing vectors was examined as 90.86% ± 3.24% by labeling the vectors encapsulated in the mito-NP ( Table S1 ). The immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that only 12.35% ± 2.35% of GFP signals co-localized with the mitochondria when GFP-expressing vectors were transfected into fibroblasts with lipo3000 ( Figures 2 G, 2H, and S2 F). By sharp contrast, 90.84% ± 2.22% GFP signals co-localized with the mitochondria when the vectors were delivered by incubating fibroblasts with mito-NP ( Figures 2 G, 2H, and S2 F), indicating the specific capacity of mito-NP to target mitochondria.
Using this mitochondria-targeting nanoparticle platform, we observed that overexpression of hsa_circ_0089762 (steatohepatitis-associated circRNA ATP5B regulator [SCAR]), rather than hsa_circ_0008882, significantly diminished cROS in NASH fibroblasts ( Figures 2 I and S2 G). Constructing a mitochondria-specific expression vector of nucleic acid that exceeds 5,000 nt is a common obstacle of the current mitochondria-targeting technique ( Patananan et al., 2016 64. Patananan, A.N. ∙ Wu, T.H. ∙ Chiou, P.Y. ... Modifying the Mitochondrial Genome Cell Metab. 2016; 23 :785-796 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we could not construct hsa_circ_0089763 mito-NP. Together, these data suggested that the suppression of mito-circRNAs may play a role in the activation of NASH fibroblasts.
Next, we further explored the role of circRNA SCAR in fibroblast activation. Using a specific probe to detect the circular rather than known linear transcript of SCAR in circBase ( Figure 3 A), RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and co-immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that 90.38% ± 2.56% of endogenous circRNA SCAR signals co-localized within the mitochondria ( Figure 3 B). Using primers that specifically detected the circular and linear transcripts of SCAR, respectively ( Figure 3 C), we performed absolute qRT-PCR. Our data showed that circRNA SCAR was 966.37 ± 114.68 copies per normal fibroblast, which was significantly higher than its linear version (443.27 ± 43.69) ( Figures 3 D and S3 A). Both circular and linear SCAR dramatically decreased in NASH fibroblasts ( Figure 3 D). The ratio of circular to linear SCAR further increased in NASH fibroblasts ( Figure S3 B). We confirmed that circRNA SCAR was circRNA by RNase R digestion analysis ( Figure 3 D).
circRNA SCAR originates from the circularization of the second exon of its host gene (JA760602) ( Figure 2 E). We inserted exon 2 into a circRNA overexpression vector ( Figure 3 C) ( Han et al., 2017 28. Han, D. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Wang, H. ... Circular RNA circMTO1 acts as the sponge of microRNA-9 to suppress hepatocellular carcinoma progression Hepatology. 2017; 66 :1151-1164 Crossref Scopus (946) PubMed Google Scholar ) and encapsulated it in mito-NP. Incubation of circRNA SCAR mito-NP significantly increased circRNA SCAR ( Figure 3 E) but had no appreciable effect on its unspliced precursor or linear transcript ( Figure S3 C). The levels of circRNA SCAR in the mitochondrial fraction, which was resistant to RNase R, was much higher than those in the cytosolic fraction ( Figure 3 E). Furthermore, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that circRNA SCAR mito-NP treatments significantly increased circRNA SCAR that was resistant to RNase R. By contrast, its linear transcript, which was susceptible to RNase R, remained unchanged ( Figure 3 F). Moreover, sequencing of the vector’s RNA product showed a perfect match to the endogenous circRNA SCAR ( Figure S3 D).
Functionally, mitochondria-specific overexpression of circRNA SCAR significantly reduced both mROS and cROS levels ( Figure S3 E) and reversed the depression of ΔΨm in NASH fibroblasts ( Figure 3 G). We found no appreciable effect on the ECAR/OCR ratio ( Figure S3 F). These data suggested that circRNA SCAR in mitochondria inhibits ROS generation and ΔΨm suppression.
Given that lipid burden leads to mROS accumulation, we asked whether circRNA SCAR can be regulated by lipid treatments. Indeed, we observed that palmitate dramatically decreased circRNA SCAR expression ( Figure 3 H). More importantly, incubation of circRNA SCAR mito-NP abrogated the elevation of mROS and cROS ( Figure 3 I) and ΔΨm reduction ( Figure 3 J) induced by palmitate, indicating that circRNA SCAR suppressed by lipid regulates ROS release and ΔΨm in the mitochondria.
In consistence with the overexpression experiments, circRNA SCAR knockdown in palmitate-treated fibroblasts further increased mROS and reduced ΔΨm ( Figures S3 G–S3I). However, silencing circRNA SCAR in normal fibroblasts had no appreciable effect ( Figures S3 G, S3J, and S3K), suggesting that the suppression of circRNA SCAR alone in normal fibroblasts does not significantly change ROS or ΔΨm.
Next, we asked whether circRNA SCAR also regulates pro-fibrotic functions of fibroblasts. circRNA SCAR overexpression substantially attenuated the expression of collagen and α-SMA ( Figure 3 K), collagen contraction, ( Figure 3 L) and cytokine secretion ( Figure 3 M) in NASH fibroblasts. Similarly, circRNA SCAR overexpression also inhibited the activation of palmitate-treated fibroblasts ( Figures S3 L and S3M). Additionally, silencing circRNA SCAR in palmitate-treated fibroblasts further enhanced their pro-fibrotic phenotypes ( Figures S3 N and S3O). Together, these data indicated that mito-circRNA SCAR suppressed by lipid burden inhibits ROS elevation and activation of fibroblasts.
Next, we investigated the mechanism of circRNA SCAR. Although a potential open reading frame (ORF) was predicted in circRNA SCAR, we inserted a 3× FLAG-coding sequence upstream of the stop codon in the potential ORF sequence and detected no flagged protein ( Figure S4 A), suggesting that circRNA SCAR is a noncoding RNA. Moreover, we identified putative binding sites for several microRNAs in circRNA SCAR ( Figure S4 B). However, none of these microRNAs contain more than two binding sites or are transcribed by the mitochondrial genome, suggesting that circRNA SCAR does not serve as microRNA sponges ( Hansen et al., 2013 29. Hansen, T.B. ∙ Jensen, T.I. ∙ Clausen, B.H. ... Natural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges Nature. 2013; 495 :384-388 Crossref Scopus (6104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we did not observe any appreciable change of its host gene (JA760602) by overexpressing circRNA SCAR ( Figure S3 C), excluding regulation of JA760602 transcripts as its mechanism ( Li et al., 2015 46. Li, Z. ∙ Huang, C. ∙ Bao, C. ... Exon-intron circular RNAs regulate transcription in the nucleus Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :256-264 Crossref Scopus (2244) PubMed Google Scholar ).
RNA binding proteins play a critical role in circRNA function ( Lasda and Parker, 2014 45. Lasda, E. ∙ Parker, R. Circular RNAs: diversity of form and function RNA. 2014; 20 :1829-1842 Crossref Scopus (965) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wilusz, 2018 84. Wilusz, J.E. A 360° view of circular RNAs: From biogenesis to functions Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2018; 9 :e1478 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using RNA pull down assay and mass spectrometry analysis as we previously reported ( Huang et al., 2018 33. Huang, D. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... NKILA lncRNA promotes tumor immune evasion by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1112-1125 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified 8 proteins that were pulled down by biotinylated probes specific for circRNA SCAR, but not by probes for anti-sense ( Figure S4 C). Among them, mPTP stood out as two of its regulators, ATP5A and ATP5B ( Bonora et al., 2014 5. Bonora, M. ∙ Bravo-San Pedro, J.M. ∙ Kroemer, G. ... Novel insights into the mitochondrial permeability transition Cell Cycle. 2014; 13 :2666-2670 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Giorgio et al., 2017 23. Giorgio, V. ∙ Burchell, V. ∙ Schiavone, M. ... Ca 2+ binding to F-ATP synthase β subunit triggers the mitochondrial permeability transition EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 :1065-1076 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), were detected ( Figure 4 A), which was further validated by western blotting ( Figure 4 B). Vice versa, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) demonstrated that circRNA SCAR was specifically precipitated by ATP5A or ATP5B ( Figure 4 C). As ATP5A binds to ATP5B ( Srivastava et al., 2018 75. Srivastava, A.P. ∙ Luo, M. ∙ Zhou, W. ... High-resolution cryo-EM analysis of the yeast ATP synthase in a lipid membrane Science. 2018; 360 :eaas9699 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ), we asked whether circRNA SCAR directly binds to ATP5A or/and ATP5B. To address this, we employed the in vitro RNA/protein interaction assay and found that circRNA SCAR directly pulled down recombinant ATP5B, rather than ATP5A. Furthermore, circRNA SCAR could only retrieve ATP5A in the presence of ATP5B ( Figure 4 D). Consistently, knockdown of endogenous ATP5B abrogated the binding of circRNA SCAR to ATP5A ( Figure 4 E), whereas silencing ATP5A had no appreciable effect on circRNA SCAR-ATP5B interaction ( Figure S4 D).
ATP5B is anchored to the matrix-facing inner membrane of mitochondria ( Hahn et al., 2016 26. Hahn, A. ∙ Parey, K. ∙ Bublitz, M. ... Structure of a Complete ATP Synthase Dimer Reveals the Molecular Basis of Inner Mitochondrial Membrane Morphology Mol. Cell. 2016; 63 :445-456 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). We purified mitochondria and mitoplasts that were stripped off the outer membrane ( Wang et al., 2014 79. Wang, G. ∙ Yang, E. ∙ Mandhan, I. ... Population-level expression variability of mitochondrial DNA-encoded genes in humans Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2014; 22 :1093-1099 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ) and observed that their levels of circRNA SCAR were comparable ( Figures S4 E and S4F), suggesting that circRNA SCAR is not mainly located in the outer membrane or intermembrane space. To investigate whether ATP5B, circRNA SCAR, and mito-NP are in the same compartment, we employed an engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) tagging method that identifies specific mitochondrial regions of RNA or protein in living cells ( Kaewsapsak et al., 2017 37.

Proteomic mapping of mitochondria in living cells via spatially restricted enzymatic tagging Science. 2013; 339 :1328-1331 Crossref Scopus (863) PubMed Google Scholar ). We transfected normal fibroblasts with constructs that target APEX to different regions and harvested different fractions using streptavidin beads. Both ATP5B and circRNA SCAR were predominantly present in the fraction that contained substances in the matrix and matrix-facing inner membrane (matrix-APEX), rather than those of the intermembrane space (IMS-APEX) or outer membrane (OMM-APEX) ( Figures 4 F–4H). Furthermore, we applied mito-NP containing GFP-expressing vectors into these fibroblasts transfected with 3 different APEX-expressing plasmids, respectively. GFP was predominantly detected in the fraction precipitated by matrix-APEX ( Figure S4 G). Together, these data demonstrated that ATP5B, circRNA SCAR, and mito-NP are in the same sub-mitochondrial compartment.
We and others have demonstrated that noncoding RNAs usually interact with proteins via stem-loop structures ( Huang et al., 2018 33. Huang, D. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... NKILA lncRNA promotes tumor immune evasion by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1112-1125 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xia et al., 2018 85. Xia, P. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ Ye, B. ... A Circular RNA Protects Dormant Hematopoietic Stem Cells from DNA Sensor cGAS-Mediated Exhaustion Immunity. 2018; 48 :688-701 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we constructed a series of truncated versions of SCAR and found that nt 100–182 of SCAR (SCAR 100-182 ), which forms a double-stranded stem structure ( Figure S4 H), interacted with ATP5B ( Figure 4 I). Moreover, nucleotide mutations that disrupted the paired region abolished the enhanced SCAR enrichment in the ATP5B RIP assay ( Figure 4 J) and ROS suppression ( Figures 4 K and S4 I) in NASH fibroblasts with circRNA SCAR-forced expression.
Although the report about ATP5B-RNA binding is lacking, we identified the ATP5B domain (ILQDYK) as a potential RNA-binding region in a published mass spectra database ( He et al., 2016 30. He, C. ∙ Sidoli, S. ∙ Warneford-Thomson, R. ... High-Resolution Mapping of RNA-Binding Regions in the Nuclear Proteome of Embryonic Stem Cells Mol. Cell. 2016; 64 :416-430 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutation of these 6 amino acids, but not the adjacent section , abrogated the binding of ATP5B to circRNA SCAR ( Figure 4 L). Collectively, these data indicated that the 100–182 motif in circRNA SCAR binds to the domain (ILQDYK) in ATP5B.
mPTP opening decreases ΔΨm and increases mROS generation and release ( Kwong and Molkentin, 2015 43. Kwong, J.Q. ∙ Molkentin, J.D. Physiological and pathological roles of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the heart Cell Metab. 2015; 21 :206-214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar ). circRNA SCAR that inhibits ROS output and ΔΨm suppression directly binds to ATP5B, an mPTP regulator ( Bonora et al., 2014 5. Bonora, M. ∙ Bravo-San Pedro, J.M. ∙ Kroemer, G. ... Novel insights into the mitochondrial permeability transition Cell Cycle. 2014; 13 :2666-2670 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Giorgio et al., 2017 23. Giorgio, V. ∙ Burchell, V. ∙ Schiavone, M. ... Ca 2+ binding to F-ATP synthase β subunit triggers the mitochondrial permeability transition EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 :1065-1076 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). To evaluate whether circRNA SCAR blocks mPTP opening, we employed calcein release assay and found that palmitate led to a marked drop in calcein fluorescence, indicating mPTP opening. More importantly, circRNA SCAR overexpression reversed mPTP opening induced by palmitate ( Figure 5 A). Consistently, we observed similar results in NASH fibroblasts ( Figure S5 A). To investigate whether the effect of circRNA SCAR on mPTP opening is dependent on its binding to ATP5B, we applied the mito-NP containing circRNA SCAR mutant, of which the binding to ATP5B was abolished ( Figure 5 B). circRNA SCAR overexpression on calcein fluorescence was completely absent ( Figures 5 A and S5 A), suggesting that the binding to ATP5B is indispensable for circRNA SCAR to shut down mPTP.
CypD, a cardinal facilitator of mPTP opening, binds to ATP synthase, in which ATP5B is located ( Antoniel et al., 2018 2. Antoniel, M. ∙ Jones, K. ∙ Antonucci, S. ... The unique histidine in OSCP subunit of F-ATP synthase mediates inhibition of the permeability transition pore by acidic pH EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :257-268 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Giorgio et al., 2013 22. Giorgio, V. ∙ von Stockum, S. ∙ Antoniel, M. ... Dimers of mitochondrial ATP synthase form the permeability transition pore Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :5887-5892 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we asked whether circRNA SCAR disrupts CypD-mPTP interaction. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that palmitate significantly enhanced the binding of CypD to mPTP, which was significantly inhibited by overexpression of wild-type circRNA SCAR, rather than the mutant ( Figure 5 C). Silencing CypD ( Figure S5 B) rescued the inhibitory effect of circRNA SCAR on mPTP opening in palmitate-treated fibroblasts with mutant overexpression ( Figure 5 D). In agreement, we observed similar effects on ΔΨm suppression ( Figure 5 D), ROS generation ( Figure 5 E), collagen contraction ( Figure 5 F), and cytokine production ( Figure 5 G). Together, these data suggested that circRNA SCAR, which directly binds to ATP5B, disrupts CypD-mPTP interaction, blocks mPTP opening, and reduces mROS output.
The mitochondrial light strand, at which SCAR host gene is located, is transcribed as a large polycistronic precursor transcript and then processed into functional units ( Mercer et al., 2011 58. Mercer, T.R. ∙ Neph, S. ∙ Dinger, M.E. ... The human mitochondrial transcriptome Cell. 2011; 146 :645-658 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (626) PubMed Google Scholar ). Components of the nuclei-encoded spliceosome, including eIF4A3 and 7 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticles (hnRNP), regulate mitochondrial RNA biogenesis ( Herai et al., 2017 31. Herai, R.H. ∙ Negraes, P.D. ∙ Muotri, A.R. Evidence of nuclei-encoded spliceosome mediating splicing of mitochondrial RNA Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 :2472-2479 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify if any of these are involved in circRNA SCAR biogenesis, we transfected normal fibroblasts with corresponding small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Silencing hnRNPM, but not others ( Figure S6 A), increased circRNA SCAR levels and the ratio between circular/linear SCAR ( Figure 6 A). Indeed, the CLIP-seq data ( Herai et al., 2017 31. Herai, R.H. ∙ Negraes, P.D. ∙ Muotri, A.R. Evidence of nuclei-encoded spliceosome mediating splicing of mitochondrial RNA Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 :2472-2479 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that the exons and flanking introns of SCAR unspliced precursor contained binding sites for hnRNPM ( Figure 6 B), which were validated by RIP and qRT-PCR ( Figure 6 C). Moreover, nuclear circRNA degradation can be mediated by RNase L ( Liu et al., 2019a 51. Liu, C.X. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Nan, F. ... Structure and Degradation of Circular RNAs Regulate PKR Activation in Innate Immunity Cell. 2019; 177 :865-880 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, although the distribution of RNase L in the mitochondria was much less than the one in the cytosol ( Figure 6 D), silencing RNase L increased the circRNA SCAR level in poly(I:C)-treated fibroblasts ( Figures 6 E and S6 B). Collectively, these results suggested that mito-circRNAs are not random transcriptional errors but are regulated during their formation and degradation.
The downregulation of circRNA SCAR by lipid prompted us to explore its expression mechanism. Bioinformative analysis identified a putative PGC-1α consensus site located at −25 to −18 bp of light strand promoter, which is responsible for circRNA SCAR transcription in the mitochondrial genome ( Figure 6 F). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that anti-PGC-1α antibody precipitated this motif ( Figure 6 G). In agreement with circRNA SCAR expression, palmitate significantly diminished PGC-1α ( Figure 6 H) and its' binding to the putative motif in the mitochondria ( Figure 6 G). Moreover, silencing endogenous PGC-1α markedly reduced circRNA SCAR expression ( Figures 6 I and S6 C), indicating that PGC-1α regulates circRNA SCAR transcription.
Lipid overload leads to ER stress ( Han and Kaufman, 2016 27. Han, J. ∙ Kaufman, R.J. The role of ER stress in lipid metabolism and lipotoxicity J. Lipid Res. 2016; 57 :1329-1338 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we found upregulation of ER stress markers in fibroblasts treated with palmitate ( Figure 6 J) and primary NASH fibroblasts ( Figure 6 K). PGC-1α can be suppressed by CHOP ( Chen et al., 2017 9. Chen, X. ∙ Zhong, J. ∙ Dong, D. ... Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced CHOP Inhibits PGC-1α and Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Diabetic Embryopathy Toxicol. Sci. 2017; 158 :275-285 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), an ER stress mediator ( Cubillos-Ruiz et al., 2017 13. Cubillos-Ruiz, J.R. ∙ Bettigole, S.E. ∙ Glimcher, L.H. Tumorigenic and Immunosuppressive Effects of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Cancer Cell. 2017; 168 :692-706 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ; Grootjans et al., 2016 25. Grootjans, J. ∙ Kaser, A. ∙ Kaufman, R.J. ... The unfolded protein response in immunity and inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16 :469-484 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate whether CHOP inhibits PGC-1α in fibroblasts, we silenced CHOP and observed that PGC-1α expression in palmitate-treated fibroblasts was restored to a comparable level of untreated fibroblasts ( Figure 6 L). In parallel to PGC-1α expression, CHOP knockdown relieved circRNA SCAR inhibition induced by palmitate ( Figure 6 M). Again, we observed similar effects in NASH fibroblasts ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Collectively, these results indicated that lipid-induced ER stress antagonists PGC-1α-dependent circRNA SCAR expression by CHOP.
Although we did not identify the mouse homolog of circRNA SCAR, the protein sequence of ATP5B is highly conserved among human and mouse (96.22%). Therapeutic strategies to use human noncoding RNA to interact with mouse protein have been demonstrated ( Wang et al., 2018 80. Wang, P. ∙ Luo, M.L. ∙ Song, E. ... Long noncoding RNA lnc-TSI inhibits renal fibrogenesis by negatively regulating the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaat2039 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, human circRNA SCAR could bind to mouse ATP5B ( Figure S7 A). Overexpression of circRNA SCAR inhibited mPTP opening ( Figure S7 B), cROS release ( Figure S7 C), and collagen contraction ( Figure S7 D) in mouse fibroblasts.
To evaluate whether mito-NP can be efficiently delivered into the mitochondria of liver fibroblasts in vivo , we labeled the circRNA expression vectors with Cy5 fluorescence. Naked vectors or vectors encapsulated by mito-NP were injected via tail vein into mice. mito-NP exhibited higher fluorescence signals than naked vectors in major organs. Among them, the livers showed the highest mito-NP accumulation ( Figures 7 A and S7 E). To investigate the cellular percentage of mito-NP uptake, we isolated fibroblasts from livers. 20.32% ± 3.67% and 74.12% ± 7.05% fibroblasts were Cy5 + after injection of naked vectors and mito-NP, respectively ( Figures 7 B and S7 F). To quantitate the mito-NP accumulation in the mitochondria, we performed the organelle fractionation and observed a more than 10-fold enrichment of mito-NP in the mitochondria compared with the cytosol ( Figures 7 C and S7 G).
To investigate the therapeutic potential of circRNA SCAR in vivo , we intravenously administered mito-NP containing circRNA SCAR overexpression vectors or empty vectors every 3 days to the mice fed with high fat-diet. We did not observe obvious toxicity in mice treated with mito-NP ( Table S2 ). FISH and co-immunofluorescence staining showed that 86.07% ± 7.17% circRNA SCAR signals co-localized with the mitochondria in the mice administered with circRNA SCAR mito-NP ( Figures 7 D and S7 H). Organelle fractionation assays of isolated fibroblasts showed that circRNA SCAR in the mitochondrial fraction was 14.92 ± 1.79-fold more than that in the cytosol ( Figure 7 E). We did not detect its linear version by overexpressing circRNA SCAR in vivo ( Figure 7 E).
The increased levels of circRNA SCAR in the mitochondria of liver fibroblasts were accompanied by inhibition of ROS levels ( Figure S7 I) and cytokine expression ( Figure S7 J). More importantly, the treatment of circRNA SCAR mito-NP substantially improved tolerance of glucose ( Figure S7 K) and insulin ( Figure 7 F), halted weight gain ( Figure S7 L), and reduced fibrosis and macrophage infiltration of livers ( Figure 7 G) in mice fed with high fat-diet.
To investigate the clinical significance of circRNA SCAR, we evaluated its expression in liver tissues of patients with or without NAFLD by FISH. circRNA SCAR was located in the mitochondria and was predominantly detected in fibroblasts ( Figure 7 H). More importantly, circRNA SCAR expression was significantly reduced in NAFLD patients compared with those without NAFLD and exhibited a continuous decline from simple steatosis to NASH cirrhosis ( Figures 7 I and S7 M). Furthermore, circRNA SCAR expression in fibroblasts was negatively correlated with both the cROS level and severity of fibrosis ( Figures 7 I and 7J) in liver samples of NAFLD patients. Additionally, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), an insulin resistance score, was inversely correlated with circRNA SCAR + liver fibroblast percentage ( Figure S7 N). Collectively, these results indicated that circRNA SCAR downregulation in liver fibroblasts is closely associated with steatosis-to-NASH progression and insulin resistance in patients.

Section: Discussion

Liver, the central hub for bodily lipid metabolism, is the most highly exposed organ to lipotoxicity. Metaflammation is a chronic inflammation driven by nutrient excess ( Franceschi et al., 2018 19. Franceschi, C. ∙ Garagnani, P. ∙ Parini, P. ... Inflammaging: a new immune-metabolic viewpoint for age-related diseases Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2018; 14 :576-590 Crossref Scopus (1525) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hotamisligil, 2017 32. Hotamisligil, G.S. Inflammation, metaflammation and immunometabolic disorders Nature. 2017; 542 :177-185 Crossref Scopus (1419) PubMed Google Scholar ). It lies at the center of immunometabolic diseases. Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of metaflammation is of paramount importance to develop treatments for metabolic diseases. Here, we uncovered the detailed molecular components of an ER-nucleus-mitochondria-cytosol communication pathway that drives lipid-mediated inflammation ( Figure S7 O). To our knowledge, this is the first report to highlight the biological significance of mitochondria-located circRNAs. More importantly, we demonstrated targeting mito-circRNAs can be a specific and restricted therapeutic strategy for immunometabolic disorders.
Our circRNomics analysis of primary liver fibroblasts from patients allowed us to perform a global assessment of the dynamic circRNA profiles during NASH. To our surprise, circRNAs transcribed by the mitochondrial genome accounted for nearly 40% of the downregulated circRNAs in NASH fibroblasts, despite they are less than 0.1% of the overall circRNomics. This sharp contrast strongly indicated that metabolic insults have significant impacts on the mitochondrial circRNomics in fibroblasts.
Although it has been reported that the binding of CypD to ATP synthase in mPTP complex is crucial for mPTP opening ( Antoniel et al., 2018 2. Antoniel, M. ∙ Jones, K. ∙ Antonucci, S. ... The unique histidine in OSCP subunit of F-ATP synthase mediates inhibition of the permeability transition pore by acidic pH EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 :257-268 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Giorgio et al., 2013 22. Giorgio, V. ∙ von Stockum, S. ∙ Antoniel, M. ... Dimers of mitochondrial ATP synthase form the permeability transition pore Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :5887-5892 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ), its regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. We found that circRNA SCAR directly binds to ATP5B of ATP synthase in mPTP complex and blocks the interaction between CypD and mPTP during the resting state. Lipid-induced ER stress reduces PGC-1α-mediated circRNA SCAR expression by CHOP, relieves the inhibition on CypD-mPTP binding and facilitates mPTP opening. Interestingly, the linear transcript of SCAR is a mitochondrial long noncoding RNA, which is dysregulated in patients with chronic heart failure ( Kumarswamy et al., 2014 42. Kumarswamy, R. ∙ Bauters, C. ∙ Volkmann, I. ... Circulating long noncoding RNA, LIPCAR, predicts survival in patients with heart failure Circ. Res. 2014; 114 :1569-1575 Crossref Scopus (521) PubMed Google Scholar ), another disease closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction ( Okonko and Shah, 2015 63. Okonko, D.O. ∙ Shah, A.M. Heart failure: mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in CHF Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2015; 12 :6-8 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether its cognate linear RNA participates in the mechanisms of circRNA SCAR warrants further studies.
Despite its detrimental effects, accumulating evidences have indicated that mROS is essential to maintain body homeostasis and extend lifespan. The difficulty to untangle its double-edge sword effects poses a huge dilemma for mROS-targeting therapy ( Rottenberg and Hoek, 2017 70. Rottenberg, H. ∙ Hoek, J.B. The path from mitochondrial ROS to aging runs through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore Aging Cell. 2017; 16 :943-955 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shadel and Horvath, 2015 74. Shadel, G.S. ∙ Horvath, T.L. Mitochondrial ROS signaling in organismal homeostasis Cell. 2015; 163 :560-569 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results suggested that this challenge can be circumvented by targeting mito-circRNA SCAR. First, manipulating circRNA SCAR expression had no appreciable effect on mROS levels in resting fibroblasts, suggesting circRNA SCAR alone is not sufficient to initiate changes of mROS, but finely tunes mROS levels during excessive mPTP opening. Second, this conclusion is further supported that no obvious toxicity could be observed in mice treated with mito-NP containing circRNA SCAR. Third, it has been postulated that circRNAs are resistant to most RNA degrading machineries due to their circular structures and therefore very stable in vivo ( Chen, 2016 8. Chen, L.L. The biogenesis and emerging roles of circular RNAs Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 :205-211 Crossref Scopus (1274) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lasda and Parker, 2014 45. Lasda, E. ∙ Parker, R. Circular RNAs: diversity of form and function RNA. 2014; 20 :1829-1842 Crossref Scopus (965) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study provided proof-of-concept evidences by showing that intravenous injection of mito-NP containing circRNA SCAR significantly increased its levels in mouse livers and mitigated high fat diet-induced cirrhosis.
The generation of nuclear circRNAs is tightly controlled by pre-mRNA splicing machinery ( Ebbesen et al., 2017 18. Ebbesen, K.K. ∙ Hansen, T.B. ∙ Kjems, J. Insights into circular RNA biology RNA Biol. 2017; 14 :1035-1045 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kristensen et al., 2019 41. Kristensen, L.S. ∙ Andersen, M.S. ∙ Stagsted, L.V.W. ...

A 360° view of circular RNAs: From biogenesis to functions Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2018; 9 :e1478 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many splicing factors regulate the biogenesis of nuclear circRNAs by mediating alternative splicing events ( Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014 3. Ashwal-Fluss, R. ∙ Meyer, M. ∙ Pamudurti, N.R. ... circRNA biogenesis competes with pre-mRNA splicing Mol. Cell. 2014; 56 :55-66 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2333) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kramer et al., 2015 40. Kramer, M.C. ∙ Liang, D. ∙ Tatomer, D.C. ... Combinatorial control of Drosophila circular RNA expression by intronic repeats, hnRNPs, and SR proteins Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :2168-2182 Crossref Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liang et al., 2017 49. Liang, D. ∙ Tatomer, D.C. ∙ Luo, Z. ... The Output of Protein-Coding Genes Shifts to Circular RNAs When the Pre-mRNA Processing Machinery Is Limiting Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :940-954 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ). All the proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome are components of the oxidative phosphorylation system. The protein factors that regulate mitochondrial RNA metabolism are entirely encoded by the nucleus and imported from the cytoplasm ( Nicholls et al., 2013 62. Nicholls, T.J. ∙ Rorbach, J. ∙ Minczuk, M. Mitochondria: mitochondrial RNA metabolism and human disease Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2013; 45 :845-849 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this notion, our data showed that hnRNPM, a component of nuclei-encoded spliceosome mediating mitochondrial RNA processing ( Herai et al., 2017 31. Herai, R.H. ∙ Negraes, P.D. ∙ Muotri, A.R. Evidence of nuclei-encoded spliceosome mediating splicing of mitochondrial RNA Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 :2472-2479 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), is involved in circRNA SCAR biogenesis. These data suggested that, similar to their nuclear counterparts, mito-circRNAs are not merely transcriptional noise, but precisely regulated.
In summary, we showed that targeting a disrupted inter-organelle metabolic axis by interfering mito-circRNAs provides an attractive therapeutic strategy for immunometabolic diseases.

Liver biopsies of adult NAFLD patients with simple steatosis (n = 33), NASH with no or mild fibrosis (n = 29) or NASH-cirrhosis (n = 15) were collected from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The surgically resected liver samples of adult NAFLD patients who received hepatic hemangioma or liver transplant operation with simple steatosis (n = 13), NASH with no or mild fibrosis (n = 18), or NASH-cirrhosis (n = 18), were collected from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Other etiologies of liver disease, including viral, autoimmune, cholestatic, genetic, alcoholic, and drug-induced were excluded. In addition, normal liver tissues were obtained from 51 patients undergoing surgery for hepatic hemangioma in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The mean age of the patients was 43 years old. 112 patients were male and 65 were female.
Liver histology was assessed separately by two liver pathologists without knowledge of the clinical data following the 2018 Practice Guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases ( Chalasani et al., 2018 7. Chalasani, N. ∙ Younossi, Z. ∙ Lavine, J.E. ... The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Hepatology. 2018; 67 :328-357 Crossref Scopus (4589) PubMed Google Scholar ). The NAFLD patients were defined as the presence of ≥ 5% hepatic steatosis without evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of hepatocyte ballooning. NASH is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (e.g., ballooning), with or without any fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was staged on a 0 to 4 scale according to the METAVIR scoring system: F0, no fibrosis; F1, portal fibrosis without septa; F2, portal fibrosis and few septa; F3, numerous septa without cirrhosis; F4, cirrhosis. All samples were anonymously coded in accordance with local ethical guidelines (as stipulated by the Declaration of Helsinki), and written informed consent was obtained. The protocol was approved by the Review Board of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University.
Primary human and mouse liver fibroblasts were isolated from liver biopsy or surgically resected samples from patients and mouse livers as we and others previously described ( Mederacke et al., 2015 56.

CD10(+)GPR77(+) Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer Stemness Cell. 2018; 172 :841-856 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar ) with slight modifications. Briefly, we incubated specimens in 5% FBS/DMEM containing 2mg/ml collagenase I (Cat# 17100-017, GIBCO), 0.4 mg/ml pronase (Cat# 10165921001, Roche), and 2mg/ml hyaluronidase (Cat# H1136, Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hr, followed by 11.5% OptiPrep™ (Cat# D1556, Sigma-Aldrich) density gradient centrifugation to purify primary fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were checked for > 90% positive staining for the fibroblast markers α-SMA (Cat# F3777, Sigma-Aldrich) or desmin (Cat# 50-9747-82, eBioscience) and negative staining for the endothelial cell marker CD31 (Cat# 48-0319-42, eBioscience), epithelial marker EpCAM (Cat# 12-9326-42, Invitrogen) or hematopoietic cell marker CD45 (Cat# 11-0451-82, eBioscience) to exclude the contamination of other cell types before subjected to further experiments. We obtained approximately 0.5-2 × 10 6 fibroblasts per gram from human liver samples and 0.5-1 × 10 5 fibroblasts per mouse liver. Fibroblasts were cultured in 10% FBS/DMEM medium and passaged every 6–8 days. In some experiments, fibroblasts isolated from patients without NAFLD were treated with 250 μM palmitate (Cat# P9767, Sigma-Aldrich), 1 μM cyclosporine A (CsA) (Cat# S2286, Selleck Chemicals), 5 μM Mito-TEMPO (Cat# ALX-430-150, Enzolife sciences), 5 μM Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) (Cat# S8639, Selleck Chemicals), or 1 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (Cat# 9165, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hr before being subjected to further experiments. We used fibroblasts from passages two to nine.
Male C57BL/6J mice (6 weeks old) were obtained from Sun Yat-Sen University Laboratory Animal Center. Mice were maintained in a 12 hr light/dark cycle at 25°C with free access to food and water. After acclimatization for one week, mice were fed with either a control diet (59.4% carbohydrate, 4.3% lipid, and 24.3% protein) or high-fat diets (2% cholesterol, 0.2% cholic acid, 8% yolk powder, 18% lard; 43.0% carbohydrate, 25.9% lipid, and 19.7% protein) (Readydietech, China) for 16 weeks. Mice were then randomly divided into three groups which respectively received an intravenous injection of PBS or mito-NP loaded with empty vectors (5 μg per mouse) or SCAR-overexpressing vectors (5 μg per mouse) every 3 days. After 8 weeks, mice were fasted for 6 hr and sacrificed. Livers and sera were harvested and subjected to further experiments. To evaluate the in vivo toxicity of mito-NP, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and MB isoenzyme of CK (CK-MB), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (T-BIL), direct bilirubin (D-BIL), creatinine (CR), and urea nitrogen (BUN) in serum were detected by Synchron LX 20 analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Body weight was measured once a week. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Review Boards and Animal Care and Use Committees of Sun Yat-Sen University.
The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were tested by Seahorse XF Glycolysis Stress Test Kit (Cat# 103020-100, Seahorse Bioscience) and Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (Cat# 103015-100, Seahorse Bioscience), respectively, in the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, 1 × 10 4 fibroblasts per well were seeded into 24-well Seahorse XF24 cell culture plates and cultured with 10% FBS DMEM overnight. Cells were washed and incubated with Seahorse XF Base Medium (Cat# 103193-100, Seahorse Bioscience) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C for 1 hr in a CO 2 -free incubator before measurement. After baseline measurements, glucose (10mM), the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor oligomycin (1 μM), and the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG (50mM) were sequentially injected into each well at indicated time points to evaluate ECAR; oligomycin (1 μM), the reversible inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation FCCP (p-trifluoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone) (1 μM), and the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone plus the mitochondrial complex III inhibitor antimycin A (Rote/AA) (0.5 μM) were sequentially injected to evaluate OCR. The reagents were provided in the Test Kits unless stated otherwise. Data were assessed by Seahorse XF-24 Wave software. Three experimental replicates were performed for the fibroblasts isolated from each patient. OCR and ECAR are displayed in pmol/min and mpH/min, respectively.
Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was studied using the JC-1 fluorescence with the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay Kit (Cat# M34152, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, fibroblasts at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells/well in a 6-well cell culture plate were incubated with 1 mg/mL JC-1 at 37°C for 20 min and rinsed three times with PBS. Fluorescent signals were analyzed by Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscopy or CytoFlex flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter). JC-1 monomers (green) fluorescence was observed by excitation at 514nm and examination of the emission at 529 nm. JC-1 aggregates (red) fluorescence was observed by excitation at 585 nm and examination of the emission at 590nm. JC-1 dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, which is indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green (529nm) to red (590nm). Therefore, the results are expressed as a ratio of 590/529 nm fluorescence.
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution (Cat# G6257, Sigma-Aldrich) (prepared in PBS, 0.2 M and pH 7.4) for 4 hr at 4°C and then post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide solution (Cat# 19140, Electron Microscopy Sciences) (prepared in PBS, 0.2 M and pH 7.4) for 1 hr at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were washed 3 times with 0.1 M PBS (PH7.4) for 15 min each time, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol to acetone, infiltrated, and embedded in epoxy resin (Cat# 31185, Sigma-Aldrich) that was polymerized in 60°C thermostats for 48 hr. The cell blocks were cut into ultrathin sections (70 nm thick) that were collected on formvar-coated nickel slot grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate (Cat# 22400, Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 0.4% lead citrate (Cat# 15326, Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature. The ultrathin sections were examined using transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN).
Cytosolic ROS and mitochondrial ROS were detected by DCFH-DA (Cat# D6883, Sigma-Aldrich) and MitoSOX (Cat# M36008, Invitrogen), respectively. Briefly, fibroblasts at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells/well in a 6-well cell culture plate were incubated with 10 μM DCFH-DA or 5 μM MitoSOX working solution at 37°C for 20 min in darkness. Cells were washed thrice with PBS and covered with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Cat# H3570, Invitrogen). Fluorescent signals were analyzed by Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscopy or CytoFlex flow cytometry.
Alternatively, cytosolic ROS and mitochondrial ROS were detected using cytoORP and mitoORP sensors respectively, which genetically encode ratiometric GFP probes to detect compartment-specific ROS. CytoORP and mitoORP sensors were constructed by Synbio Technologies as previously described ( Dey et al., 2016 14. Dey, S. ∙ Sidor, A. ∙ O’Rourke, B. Compartment-specific Control of Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging by Antioxidant Pathway Enzymes J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :11185-11197 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fibroblasts were transfected with cytoORP or mitoORP sensors using Lipofectamine 3000 (Cat# L3000015, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 hr, mitoORP or cytoORP were excited with the 405 and 488nm laser lines, and emission was detected with a 515nm bandpass filter using Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscopy. The 405/488 nm excitation ratio was calculated by ImageJ software. The detail information of primers and vectors is listed in Table S3 .
Cell suspensions in serum-free media were mixed with 3mg/ml neutralized rat tail collagen type I (Cat# 354249, Corning) at a ratio of 2:1. Then, 500 μL cell suspensions at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells/ml were seeded onto 24-well culture plates. The gels were allowed to polymerize at 37°C for 1 hr. Thereafter, 1 mL media was added and the edges of the gels were detached from the well walls. After 48 hr, the gel images were taken by Nikon Ni-U microscopy and gel areas were measured using ImageJ software.
Total proteins were extracted from cells using radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Cat# R0278, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitor (1:100, Cat# ab65621, Abcam) and phosphatase inhibitor (1:100, Cat# 78442, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentration was measured by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Cat# 23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels (Cat# PG112, EpiZyme Biotechnology, China), transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with antibodies against α-SMA (1:1000, Cat# ab32575, Abcam), collagen I (1:1000, Cat# ab34710, Abcam), collagen III (1:1000, Cat# ab7778, Abcam), PGC-1α (1:1000, Cat# AB3242, Sigma-Aldrich), CypD (1:1000, Cat# ab231155, Abcam), CHOP (1:1000, Cat# 2895s, Cell Signaling Technology), ATF4 (1:1000, Cat# 10835-1-AP, Proteintech), p-PERK (1:1000, Cat# DF7576, Affinity), p-eIF2α (1:1000, Cat# bs4842R, Bioss), ATP5A (1:1000, Cat# ab176569, Abcam), ATP5B (1:1000, Cat# ab128743, Abcam), HSP60 (1:5000, Cat# ab46798, Abcam), AIF (1:1000, Cat# ab32516, Abcam), Tom20 (1:1000, Cat# ab56783, Abcam), hnRNPA1 (1:1000, Cat# ab5832, Abcam), hnRNPA2B1 (1:1000, Cat# ab6102, Abcam), hnRNPC (1:1000, Cat# ab133607, Abcam), eIF4A3 (1:1000, Cat# ab32485, Abcam), hnRNPF (1:1000, Cat# NBP1-33607, Novus), hnRNPH (1:1000, Cat# ab10374, Abcam), hnRNPM (1:1000, Cat# NB200-314, Novus), hnRNPU (1:1000, Cat# ab10297, Abcam), RNase L (1:1000, Cat# A9840, ABclonal), COX IV (1:1000, Cat# ab16056, Abcam), GFP (1:5000, Cat# ab183734, Abcam), FLAG (1:1000, Cat# F1804, Sigma-Aldrich) or GAPDH (1:2000, Cat# 60004-1-Ig, Proteintech) at 4°C overnight. Afterward, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000, Cat# 7074S, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-mouse IgG (1:3000, Cat# 7076S, Cell Signaling Technology) secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using SuperSignal™ West Femto (Cat# 34095, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in iBright™ imaging systems or X-ray film. In some experiments, the previous primary antibody and secondary antibody were stripped from the PVDF membrane with stripping buffer (Cat# P0025, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 5 min. After being re-blocked, the membrane was re-incubated with another primary antibody at 4°C overnight. The following steps were the same as described above.
Concentrations of human IL-1β (Cat# E-EL-H0149c, ElabScience), TNF-α (Cat# E-EL-H0109c, ElabScience), IL-8 (Cat# E-EL-H0048c, ElabScience), and CCL-2 (Cat# DCP00, R&D Systems) were detected using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cell culture media were collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 20 min to remove cell debris. 200 μL of supernatants were used in the ELISA assays. Three experimental replicates were performed for the fibroblasts isolated from each patient.
Cells were dissociated by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and harvested by centrifugation. Apoptosis was determined using an Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (Cat# BMS500FI/300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with 100 μL of binding buffer containing 5 μL of FITC-conjugated Annexin V antibody for 15 min at room temperature. After incubation, the cells were washed and resuspended in binding buffer (200 μL) containing 5 μL of Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining Solution and analyzed by CytoFlex (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometry immediately. Data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Treestar).
Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent. The purity and concentration of total RNAs were determined by NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNAs were digested with RNase R (1U/μg, Cat# RNR07250, Epicenter) to enrich circular RNA, amplified, and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA using Arraystar Super RNA Labeling Kit (Cat# 074301, Arraystar) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The labeled cirRNAs were hybridized onto Arraystar Human circRNA Arrays V2 (8 × 15K, Arraystar), and incubated for 17 hr at 65°C in an Agilent Hybridization Oven. Hybridized arrays were washed and scanned with Agilent Scanner G2505C. Data was extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction software. A series of data processing including quantile normalization were performed by R software limma package. The circRNAs that at least 1 out of 2 samples containing flags in “P” or “M” (defined by GeneSpring software) were retained for differential analyses. Differentially expressed circRNAs with statistical significance between two groups were identified by fold change cutoff or through Volcano Plot filtering. The circRNA expression profile data are available in the GEO databases (accession number GSE134146 ).
Mitochondrial fractionation was performed using Mitochondria Isolation Kit for Cultured Cells (Cat# 89874, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 × 10 6 - 1 × 10 7 fibroblasts were collected and incubated in ice-cold mitochondria isolation buffer for 15 min. After homogenate, nuclei and unbroken cells were discarded after centrifugation at 600 g for 10 min. The pellet enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and supernatant enriched in the cytosolic fraction were obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min. To further isolate mitochondrial outer-membrane and mitoplast (inner-membrane plus matrix), isolated mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in 0.15 mg/mL digitonin (Cat# D141, Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. Afterward, mitochondria isolation buffer was added and the suspension was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were collected as mitoplasts ( Wang et al., 2020 81. Wang, J. ∙ Zhu, P. ∙ Li, R. ... Bax inhibitor 1 preserves mitochondrial homeostasis in acute kidney injury through promoting mitochondrial retention of PHB2 Theranostics. 2020; 10 :384-397 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Total RNAs was extracted from cells using TRIzol (Cat# 15596026, TAKARA). RNA isolated from the fractionation assay of mitochondria were extracted from different fractions using PARIS™ Kit (Cat# AM1921, Invitrogen). In some experiments, total RNA or fractioned RNA was treated with RNase R (1U/μg, Cat# RNR07250, Epicenter) at 37°C for 15 min. RNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA templates using random primers and PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Cat# RR047A, TAKARA) and amplified.

The detail information of the primers and sequences of shRNA is listed in Table S3 .
The mitochondria-targeting nanoparticles were prepared using the classic nanoprecipitation method. In brief, the Meo-PEG- b -PDPA polymer was dissolved in DMF (Cat# 227056, Sigma-Aldrich) to form a homogeneous solution with a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Subsequently, a mixture of TACP (5 mg/mL in DMSO) and 10 μg circRNA-expressing vectors (1 mg/mL aqueous solution), 10 μg pLKO.1-puro shRNA construct (1 mg/mL aqueous solution) or 10 μg pXCX-CMV-EGFP (1 mg/mL aqueous solution) was prepared and mixed with 200 μL of Meo-PEG- b -PDPA solution. Under vigorously stirring (1000 rpm), the mixture was added dropwise to 5 mL of deionized water. The formed nanoparticle dispersion was transferred to an ultrafiltration device (MWCO 100 K, EMD Millipore) and centrifuged to remove the organic solvent and free compounds. After washing with ultrapure water thrice, the obtained nanoparticles were dispersed in 1 mL of ultrapure water. The size and zeta potential were determined by DLS (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation).
To determine the vector encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and biodistribution, 10 μg circRNA expressing vectors were labeled with 0.5 μL of Cy5 using Label IT® Tracker Intracellular Nucleic Acid Localization Kits (Cat# MIR 7021, Mirus) and then encapsulated into the nanoparticles prepared as described above. Subsequently, 5 μL of the nanoparticle solution was mixed with 20-fold DMSO. The standard was prepared by mixing 5 μL of naked Cy5-labeled vectors (1 μg/μL) with 20-fold DMSO. The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured using a multimode microplate reader (TECAN SPARK 10M), and the vector encapsulation efficiency was calculated as EE% = (FI NP /FI Standard ) × 100%. Nanoparticles with a vector EE% greater than 80% were adopted for further experiments.
Fibroblasts were seeded into 24-well plates (5 × 10 4 cells/well) and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 hr, the cells were incubated with mito-NP at a vector concentration of 200 ng/mL for 48-72 hr and then subjected to further experiments.
The FISH and co-immunofluorescence staining in cells were performed as we previously described ( Chen et al., 2019 10. Chen, F. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... Extracellular vesicle-packaged HIF-1α-stabilizing lncRNA from tumour-associated macrophages regulates aerobic glycolysis of breast cancer cells Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :498-510 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ). To evaluate the specific mitochondria targeting property of mito-NP, fibroblasts (5 × 10 4 cells/well) were incubated with mito-NP containing GFP-expressing vectors for 3 days. Thereafter, the mitochondria were stained with 200 nM MitoTracker® Red (Cat# M7512, Invitrogen) for 30 min. After being washed with PBS thrice, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Cat# H3570, Invitrogen). To evaluate endogenous circRNA SCAR, fibroblasts were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and then permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice. Cells were washed thrice with PBS and dehydrated with 75% ethanol at 4°C, 75% ethanol at −20°C, 85% ethanol at −20°C, and absolute ethanol at −20°C for 5 min each. After prehybridization in 2 × SSC for 1 hr at 52°C, samples were hybridized with 20nM digoxin-labeled oligonucleotide probe (Synbio Technologies) against circRNA SCAR overnight at 52°C, rinsed twice with 5 × SSC at hybridization temperature, washed thrice with 2 × SSC/50% formamide at hybridization temperature for 20 min and washed by 0.1% Tween 20 PBS (PBST) for four times. Samples were incubated with 10% normal goat serum (Cat# ab7481, Abcam) for 1 hr and then incubated with anti-digoxigenin-FITC antibody (1:300, Cat# 11207741910, Roche) and mouse anti-Tom20 antibody (1:1000, Cat# ab56783, Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed in PBST and then incubated with Alexa Fluor® 647 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400, Cat# ab150115, Abcam) at room temperature for 1 hr. Finally, samples were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Cat# H3570, Invitrogen). The sequences of oligonucleotide probes are listed in Table S3 .
High-resolution images were taken on a confocal laser-scanning microscope using a 100 × oil immersion objective (Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X). For confocal Z stack imaging, image stacks were acquired from the Z series (250 nm step size) recordings and filtered using a 3 × 3 median filter to reduce speckle noise. Contrast and brightness were optimized in the brightest slice of the stack, and the same settings were applied to the rest of the sections. For three dimensional (3D) rendering, Leica SP8 acquisitions were processed using the Leica software package.
The signal colocalization of GFP and mitochondria was evaluated using the Imaris 9.0 Analysis software package (Bitplane) as we previously described ( Lu et al., 2020 53. Lu, Y. ∙ Zhao, Q. ∙ Liao, J.Y. ... Complement Signals Determine Opposite Effects of B Cells in Chemotherapy-Induced Immunity Cell. 2020; 180 :1081-1097 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, immunofluorescence signal was adjusted by subtracting negative control staining. An algorithm learning tool was performed to evaluate the colocolization of GFP and mitochondria by dividing colocalizing spots of MitoTracker Red and GFP by GFP positive spots in the cells by the Imaris 9.0. At least ten cells were assessed from 3 view-fields at 1000 × magnification per sample were evaluated and quantitated.
The FISH and co-immunofluorescence staining in tissue were performed as we previously described ( Huang et al., 2018 33. Huang, D. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... NKILA lncRNA promotes tumor immune evasion by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1112-1125 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Su et al., 2015 76.

Commun. 2015; 6 :8523 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the paraffin embedded sections were washed twice with PBS and dehydrated with ethanol. The sections were rehydrated in 50% formamide in 2 × SSC for 5min and prehybridized in 2 × SSC for 1 hr at 52°C. Then, the sections were hybridized with digoxin-labeled oligonucleotide probes (Synbio Technologies) against circRNA SCAR as described above. Sections were blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H 2 O 2 in PBST for 30 min, incubated with 5% BSA for 1 hr and then incubated with anti-digoxigenin-FITC antibody (1:300, Cat# 11207741910, Roche), rabbit anti-human/mouse COX IV antibody (1:200, Cat# ab16056, Abcam), and goat anti-human/mouse α-SMA (1:200, Cat# PA5-18292, Invitrogen) overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed in PBST and then incubated with Alexa Fluor® 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Cat# ab150075, Abcam) and Cy3 donkey anti-goat IgG (1:300, Cat# ab6949, Abcam) at room temperature for 1 hr. Finally, sections were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Cat# H3570, Invitrogen). Cell signals were quantitated per field of view, and at least 10 fields per section were evaluated at 400 × magnification using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 800). The signals of SCAR and mitochondria were obtained as described above. An algorithm learning tool was performed by Imaris 9.0 to evaluate the colocalization of SCAR signals and mitochondria by dividing colocalizing spots of Alexa Fluor® 647 and FITC by FITC positive spots. Percentage of SCAR + α-SMA + cells in total α-SMA + cells were evaluated in a similar manner. At least 10 view-fields at 400 × magnification per sample were evaluated and quantitated.
Northern blots were performed using NorthernMax reagents (Cat# AM1940, Invitrogen) and DIG Northern Starter Kit (Cat# 12039672910, Roche) as we and others previously described ( Huang et al., 2018 33. Huang, D. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... NKILA lncRNA promotes tumor immune evasion by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1112-1125 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liang et al., 2017 49. Liang, D. ∙ Tatomer, D.C. ∙ Luo, Z. ... The Output of Protein-Coding Genes Shifts to Circular RNAs When the Pre-mRNA Processing Machinery Is Limiting Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :940-954 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 10-20 μg RNA with or without RNase R pretreatments (1U/μg, 37°C for 15 min) was loaded onto 2% formaldehyde/MOPS/agarose gels alongside RNA Ladder (Cat# SM1823, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After electrophoresis for 3 hr at 60 V, RNA was transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) overnight and UV-crosslinked at 1200 × 100 μJ/cm 2 for 2 min. Membranes were then prehybridized for 30 min at 52°C in DIG Easy Hyb buffer (Roche). Digoxigenin labeled Oligonucleotide probes (8 pM) were hybridized to the membranes overnight at 52°C. Afterward, membranes were washed with stringency wash solution for 3 times, incubated in anti-digoxigenin-AP for 30 min at room temperature, and exposed on Lumi-film with CSPD chemiluminescence solution. Ethidium bromide staining of rRNAs was used as a loading control. Blots were viewed and quantified with a Typhoon 9500 scanner (GE Healthcare) and quantified using ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized by Synbio Technologies, and their sequences are provided in Table S3 .
RNA pull-down was performed using a Magnetic RNA-Protein Pull-Down Kit (Cat# 20164, Thermo Fisher Scientific) as we previously described ( Huang et al., 2018 33. Huang, D. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... NKILA lncRNA promotes tumor immune evasion by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1112-1125 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 5 × 10 6 fibroblasts were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then lysed in 500 μL co-IP buffer at 4°C for 2 hr. Lysate was hybridized with 100 nM biotinylated DNA oligo probes (Synbio Technologies, China) against endogenous SCAR at 37°C overnight. Streptavidin Magnetic Beads (Cat# 65305, Invitrogen) were added to each binding reaction and further incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. The beads were washed with co-IP buffer for five times. The retrieved protein was detected by western blotting or mass spectrometry analysis.
For in vitro RNA/protein interaction assay, different truncated versions of SCAR were amplified and cloned into the pUC57-Amp vector with a T7 promoter. RNA was transcribed in vitro by TranscriptAid T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Cat# K0441, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then labeled with biotin using RNA 3′ End Biotinylation Kit (Cat# 20160, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufactures’ instructions. Five picomoles of 3′-biotinylated transcribed RNA was incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads and then interacted with 1 μg recombinant human ATP5A (Cat# ab235862, Abcam), recombinant human ATP5B (Cat# ab235856, Abcam) or recombinant human mutant ATP5B expressed by pET-28a (+) (Synbio Technologies, China). The retrieved protein was detected by western blotting. Biotinylated RNA input was detected in blots using Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module Kit (Cat# 89880, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The detailed sequences of DNA oligo probes and in vitro expression vectors are listed in Table S3 .
To predict ORF in circRNA SCAR, we utilized the Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) ( Kang et al., 2017 39. Kang, Y.J. ∙ Yang, D.C. ∙ Kong, L. ... CPC2: a fast and accurate coding potential calculator based on sequence intrinsic features Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :W12-W16 Crossref Scopus (814) PubMed Google Scholar ) as previously described ( Tang et al., 2020 78. Tang, C. ∙ Xie, Y. ∙ Yu, T. ... m 6 A-dependent biogenesis of circular RNAs in male germ cells Cell Res. 2020; 30 :211-228 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). The full-length circRNA SCAR sequences were sent to the CPC website for coding potential predictions based on the default parameters for support vector machine (SVM) analysis of six features of ORF and BLASTX scores.
To test whether the predicted ORF sequence in the circRNA SCAR is functional, we inserted a FLAG-coding sequence into circRNA overexpression vector as previously described ( Zhao et al., 2019 92. Zhao, J. ∙ Lee, E.E. ∙ Kim, J. ... Transforming activity of an oncoprotein-encoding circular RNA from human papillomavirus Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2300 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, plasmid SCAR was produced by cloning the circRNA SCAR sequence into pcD-ciR (Geneseed Biotech Co, China) as we described above. Plasmid SCAR-3 × FLAG was generated by inserting a 3 × FLAG-coding sequence (GACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGA TCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAG) immediately upstream of the stop codon (TGA) present in the potential ORF sequence, such that a flagged protein could be produced only when the potential ORF sequence is translated. As a positive control, plasmid 3 × FLAG was produced by cloning a 3 × FLAG-coding sequence into pcD-ciR (Geneseed Biotech Co, China). Three days after transfection, the cells were harvested and proteins were evaluated by western blotting analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000, Cat# F1804, Sigma-Aldrich).
Mass spectrometric analysis of RNA-binding proteins was performed as we previously described ( Chen et al., 2019 10. Chen, F. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ...

Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :498-510 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, proteins pull-downed by SCAR probes and antisense probes were extracted with 50% acetonitrile (Cat# 271004, Sigma-Aldrich) and dried. Dried proteins were incubated with 10mM dithiothreitol (Cat# 43815, Sigma-Aldrich) and 55mM iodoacetamide (Cat# A3221, Sigma-Aldrich) successively, washed with 25mM ammonium bicarbonate (Cat# A6141, Sigma-Aldrich), and dried again. Then, proteins were digested with trypsin at 37°C overnight. After digestion, samples were loaded through a 5 μm C18 trap, followed by 1 hour 4%–26% acetonitrile gradient on a 5 μm C18 column, and were analyzed on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The acquired data were analyzed against the customized protein database using Mascot software (version 2.3.01 Matrix Science, London, UK) against a human RefSeq database, and peak lists were searched against the Homo sapiens Uniprot FASTA database. Data analysis was performed with the Perseus software in the MaxQuant computational platform and in the R statistical computing environment. Data were imputed by creating a Gaussian distribution of random numbers with a s.d. of 30% in comparison to the s.d. of measured values, and one s.d. downshift of the mean to simulate the distribution of low signal values.
RNA immunoprecipitation was performed using a Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Cat# 17-700, Millipore) as we previously described ( Chen et al., 2019 10.

Protein A/G magnetic beads (Cat# 88802, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to each sample and the mixtures were incubated at 4°C for 4 hr. After immunoprecipitation, the co-precipitated RNA was extracted by proteinase K-chloroform method and subjected to qRT–PCR analysis.

Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Cat# 65305, Invitrogen) were washed twice with RIPA lysis buffer. 90 μL of whole cell lysate was incubated with 30 μL of streptavidin bead slurry and 500 μL of RIPA lysis buffer (without quenchers) for 1.5 hours with gentle rotation at room temperature. The beads were washed with 1 mL RIPA lysis buffer twice, 1 mL of 2 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 once, and then 1 mL RIPA lysis buffer twice.

The streptavidin eluate (SAE) was collected for subsequent western blotting experiments as described above.
For RIP assay ( Kaewsapsak et al., 2017 37. Kaewsapsak, P. ∙ Shechner, D.M. ∙ Mallard, W. ... Live-cell mapping of organelle-associated RNAs via proximity biotinylation combined with protein-RNA crosslinking eLife. 2017; 6 :e29224 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), the cells were crosslinked by addition of 5 mL crosslink-quench solution (0.1% (v/v) formaldehyde (Cat# 252549, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 5 mM Trolox in PBS). After 1 min, the media were aspirated, and the cells were again incubated in 5 mL fresh crosslink-quench solution for 9 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The crosslinking reaction was terminated by addition of glycine (Cat# G7126, Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 125 mM for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested by scraping, and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were lysed with Pierce® IP lysis buffer (Cat# 87787, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with protease-inhibitor cocktail (1:100, Cat# ab65621, Abcam) and 1,000 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Cat# N2511, Promega) for 15 min at 4°C with end-over-end agitation. Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, transferred to fresh tubes, and each diluted with 500 μL Native lysis buffer (NLB: 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA) supplemented with 10 mM ascorbate and 5 mM Trolox. 20% of each sample was removed as the ‘input’. The remainder was added to 50 μL streptavidin-coated magnetic bead slurry (Cat# 65305, Invitrogen), which had been equilibrated by two washes in 1:1 IP lysis buffer: NLB. Samples were incubated for 2 hr at 4°C with end-over-end agitation. Beads were subsequently washed with the following series of buffers (1 mL each, 5 min per wash, 4°C, with gentle end-over-end agitation): (1) RIPA buffer, supplemented with trolox and ascorbate, (2) RIPA buffer without radi- cal quenchers, (3) high salt buffer (1 M KCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA), (4) urea buffer (2 M Urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA), (5) RIPA Buffer, (6) 1:1 RIPA: NLB, (7) NLB, and (8) TE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA).

Eluted samples were cleaned up using GeneJET RNA Purification Kit (Cat# K0731, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol and eluted into 50 μL H 2 O. Then, contaminating DNA was removed by digestion with 5 U RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Cat# 89836, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100 μL manufacturer’s supplied buffer at 37°C for 30 min. Purified RNAs were again cleaned up using GeneJET RNA Purification Kit and eluted into 30 μL H 2 O before being subjected to PCR experiments as described above.
We performed calcein-AM loading/CoCl 2 quenching assay to evaluate mPTP opening as previously described ( Ying et al., 2018 88. Ying, Z. ∙ Xiang, G. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Short-Term Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore Opening Modulates Histone Lysine Methylation at the Early Phase of Somatic Cell Reprogramming Cell Metab. 2018; 28 :935-945 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Transition Pore Assay Kit (Cat# I35103, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, fibroblasts were treated with 1 μM calcein-AM in darkness at 37°C for 15 min in the presence of 5 mM cobalt chloride (CoCl 2 ) to quench the cytoplasmic and nuclear signals. Calcein was excited at 494nm, and emission was recorded at 517 nm. Cells were washed twice with Hanks’ balanced salt solution-10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) before being evaluated by Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope or CytoFlex flow cytometry.
Immunoprecipitation (IP) of ATP synthase, ATP5A, or ATP5B was performed using mouse anti-human ATP synthase Immunocapture antibody (1:100, Cat# ab109867, Abcam), mouse anti-human ATP5A antibody (1:100, Cat# ab14748, Abcam), or mouse anti-human ATP5B antibody (1:100, Cat# ab14730, Abcam) at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with protein A/G magnetic beads (Cat# 88802, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and washed with lysis buffer. Mouse IgG (1:100, Cat# 12-371, Millipore) was used as a negative control. The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 1 × SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 - 100°C for 5 min, and then detected by western blotting using rabbit anti-human CypD (1:1000, Cat# ab231155, Abcam), rabbit anti-human ATP5A (1:1000, Cat# ab176569, Abcam), or rabbit anti-human ATP5B (1:1000, Cat# ab128743, Abcam).
For shRNA transduction, a lentiviral vector plasmid pLKO.1-puro (GenePharma Inc, Shanghai, China) was used to construct the stable clones. To produce lentiviral particles, 5 × 10 6 HEK293FT cells in a 10-cm dish were transfected with 10 μg of pLKO.1-puro shRNA construct. The supernatant containing viral particles was harvested twice at 48 hr and 72 hr after transfection and filtered through 0.22 μm Millex-GP Filter Unit (Millipore). Virus carrying shRNAs were used to transduce primary human fibroblasts as we previously described with slight modifications ( Su et al., 2015 76. Su, S. ∙ Zhao, Q. ∙ He, C. ... miR-142-5p and miR-130a-3p are regulated by IL-4 and IL-13 and control profibrogenic macrophage program Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8523 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 5 × 10 5 cells in 6-well plates were transduced with the lentiviral vectors (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 30) and 10 μg/mL polybrene (Cat# H9268, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C overnight. The medium was then aspirated and replaced with fresh growth medium. For siRNA transfection, 5 × 10 5 fibroblasts were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with specific siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 3000 (Cat# L3000015, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After three days, the cells were harvested for further analyses. To activate RNase L, fibroblasts were transfected with poly(I:C) (1 μg/mL, Cat# P9582, Sigma-Aldrich) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Cat# L3000015, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The knockdown efficiency of RNA and proteins was evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The oligonucleotide sequences of shRNA and siRNA are listed in Table S3 .
The data from cross-linking immunoprecipitation-high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) for spliceosomal proteins HNRNPA1, HNRNPA2B1, HNNRNPC, ELF4AIII, HNRNPF, HNRNPH, HNRNPM, and HNRNPU were retrieved from published studies ( Herai et al., 2017 31. Herai, R.H. ∙ Negraes, P.D. ∙ Muotri, A.R. Evidence of nuclei-encoded spliceosome mediating splicing of mitochondrial RNA Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 :2472-2479 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads were adaptor trimmed and filtered for short sequences by Cutadapt ( Didion et al., 2017 16. Didion, J.P. ∙ Martin, M. ∙ Collins, F.S. Atropos: specific, sensitive, and speedy trimming of sequencing reads PeerJ. 2017; 5 :e3720 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martin, 2011 55. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from highthroughput sequencing reads EMBnet. J. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ), using minimum-length 18, error-rate 0.2, overlap five options. These datasets were gapped-aligned against human (build hg19) genomes and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with the STAR software package ( Dobin et al., 2013 17. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25613) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignments were used to show read coverage of CLIP-seq data over the mtDNA. Absolute numbers of reads were normalized by the sequence library size. A logarithm base 2 scale was plotted for mtDNA. Graphical representations were created using the STAR software. Graphical representations were generated using the IGV genome browser ( Robinson et al., 2011 68. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Winckler, W. ... Integrative genomics viewer Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :24-26 Crossref Scopus (9112) PubMed Google Scholar ).
ChIP assay was performed using ChIP Assay Kit (Cat# 26157, Thermo Fisher Scientific) as we previously described ( Huang et al., 2018 33. Huang, D. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Yang, L. ... NKILA lncRNA promotes tumor immune evasion by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1112-1125 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Su et al., 2015 76. Su, S. ∙ Zhao, Q. ∙ He, C. ... miR-142-5p and miR-130a-3p are regulated by IL-4 and IL-13 and control profibrogenic macrophage program Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8523 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, fibroblasts were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were harvested, lysed, and sonicated for 10 cycles of 30 s on/45 s off. The lysates were incubated with antibodies directly against PGC-1α (1:100, Cat# AB3242, Sigma) or control rabbit IgG (1:100, Cat# 2729, Cell Signaling Technology) at 4°C overnight. PGC-1α was then immunoprecipitated by protein A/G magnetic beads (Cat# 88802, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and washed with lysis buffer. DNA was extracted by proteinase K-chloroform method and subjected to PCR amplification. The primer sequences used in ChIP assay are described in Table S3 .
To investigate the organ distribution of mito-NP in vivo , circRNA-expressing vectors were labeled with Cy5 using Label IT® Tracker Intracellular Nucleic Acid Localization Kits (Cat# MIR 7021, Mirus) as decribed above. Healthy male C57BL/6J mice (10 weeks old) were randomly given an intravenous injection with naked Cy5-labeled vectors (0.2 mg/kg), mito-NP loaded with Cy5-labeled vectors (0.2 mg/kg) or PBS via the tail vein. The mice were sacrificed 24 hr after the injection. The main organs were harvested and then imaged using the Maestro 2 In-Vivo Imaging System (Cri Inc.). To quantify the accumulation of vectors in organs, the fluorescence intensity of each tissue was quantified by ImageJ software as we previously described ( Xu et al., 2017 87. Xu, X. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Multifunctional Envelope-Type siRNA Delivery Nanoparticle Platform for Prostate Cancer Therapy ACS Nano. 2017; 11 :2618-2627 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). To evaluate the vector uptake by fibroblasts, liver fibroblasts were isolated from mouse livers as described above. The fluorescence intensity of isolated fibroblasts was examined by CytoFlex flow cytometry. To quantify the sub-cellular distribution of vectors in fibroblasts of mouse livers, the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were isolated as described above and homogenized in lysis buffer. The lysates were transferred to a black 96-well plate (Corning). The fluorescence intensity of the samples was measured by a multimode microplate reader (TECAN SPARK 10M) with an excitation at 649 nm and emission at 670 nm. The concentration of Cy5-labeled vectors in each sample was calculated from a standard curve. A standard curve was generated by series dilution of mito-NP loaded with Cy5-labeled vectors.
Glucose-tolerance tests were performed in mice after an overnight fast. Glucose was injected intraperitoneally (2g/kg body weight). Blood glucose concentrations in blood were measured at the indicated times with a glucometer (Roche). Insulin tolerance tests were performed in mice fed ad libitum . After determination of basal blood glucose concentrations, each mouse received an intraperitoneal injection of insulin (1 IU/kg body weight; Cat# 11070-73-8, Sigma-Aldrich). Glucose concentrations in blood were measured at the indicated times.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver biopsies or sections were cut into 4 μm serial sections. NAFLD severity was detected by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and quantitated by the steatosis activity and fibrosis (SAF) score ( Bedossa and FLIP Pathology Consortium, 2014 4. Bedossa, P., FLIP Pathology Consortium Utility and appropriateness of the fatty liver inhibition of progression (FLIP) algorithm and steatosis, activity, and fibrosis (SAF) score in the evaluation of biopsies of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Hepatology. 2014; 60 :565-575 Crossref Scopus (489) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sirius red staining was performed by Picro Sirius Red Stain Kit (Cat# ab150681, Abcam). For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0). Slides were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide/methanol for 10 min and washed with PBS. After blocking with normal goat serum (Cat# ab7481, Abcam), sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-mouse collagen III (1:100, Cat# ab7778, Abcam), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:300, Cat# 7074S, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 hr at room temperature. Diaminobenzidine (Cat# 34002, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a chromogen, and sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunofluorescent staining, deparaffinized and rehydrated slides were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse F4/80 monoclonal antibody (1:100, Cat# 30325, Cell Signaling Technology) or rabbit anti-human α-SMA monoclonal antibody (1:100, Cat# ab32575, Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Thereafter, slides were washed thrice with PBST, incubated with DyLight 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Cat# E032220-01, EarthOx) for 1 hr at room temperature and stained with Hoechst 33342 (Cat# H3570, Invitrogen). For ROS detection, sections were stained with 1 μM Dihydroethidium (DHE, Cat# D11347, Invitrogen) in darkness at 37°C for 30 min before goat serum blockade. Morphometric analysis was performed using Nikon Ni-U microscopy. An algorithm learning tool was performed by Imaris 9.0 to evaluate the colocalization of α-SMA and DHE signals as described in the FISH and Immunofluorescence Analysis section above. Quantification was performed by morphometric analysis in randomly chosen sections (400 × magnification, 10 fields/sample).
Transient elastography was performed using a FibroScan system (Echosens, Paris, France) by the M probe as we and others previously described ( Friedrich-Rust et al., 2016 21. Friedrich-Rust, M. ∙ Poynard, T. ∙ Castera, L. Critical comparison of elastography methods to assess chronic liver disease Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 13 :402-411 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2019 91. Zhang, G.L. ∙ Zhao, Q.Y. ∙ Lin, C.S. ... Transient Elastography and Ultrasonography: Optimal Evaluation of Liver Fibrosis and Cirrhosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B Concurrent with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease BioMed Res. Int. 2019; 2019 :3951574 PubMed Google Scholar ). After an overnight fast, patients underwent transient elastography examination within 3 days of liver biopsy by trained operators who had previously performed at least 500 scans in patients with chronic liver disease. The operators were blinded to the clinical data and pathology results. The value expressed in kilopascal (kPa) was recorded as a representation of liver stiffness. Up to 10 valid measurements were performed for each patient. A success rate above 60% and an interquartile range/median ratio of less than 30% were considered reliable.
The homeostasis model assessment method was used to calculate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), as described by others ( Rosso et al., 2019 69. Rosso, C. ∙ Kazankov, K. ∙ Younes, R. ... Crosstalk between adipose tissue insulin resistance and liver macrophages in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease J. Hepatol. 2019; 71 :1012-1021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ) from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations using the following formula: fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) × fasting plasma insulin (mU/L) / 22.5.
