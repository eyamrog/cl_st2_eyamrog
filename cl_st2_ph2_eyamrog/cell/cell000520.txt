Title: Protection from SARS-CoV-2 Delta one year after mRNA-1273 vaccination in rhesus macaques coincides with anamnestic antibody response in the lung


Abstract: Summary

mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Delta wanes over time; however, there are limited data on the impact of durability of immune responses on protection. Here, we immunized rhesus macaques and assessed immune responses over 1 year in blood and upper and lower airways. Serum neutralizing titers to Delta were 280 and 34 reciprocal ID 50 at weeks 6 (peak) and 48 (challenge), respectively. Antibody-binding titers also decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Four days after Delta challenge, the virus was unculturable in BAL, and subgenomic RNA declined by ∼3-log 10 compared with control animals. In nasal swabs, sgRNA was reduced by 1-log 10 , and the virus remained culturable. Anamnestic antibodies (590-fold increased titer) but not T cell responses were detected in BAL by day 4 post-challenge. mRNA-1273-mediated protection in the lungs is durable but delayed and potentially dependent on anamnestic antibody responses. Rapid and sustained protection in upper and lower airways may eventually require a boost.

Section: Introduction

COVID-19 vaccines designed to express the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, including the mRNA-based vaccines mRNA-1273 ( Baden et al., 2021b 2.

However, new SARS-CoV-2 variants have mutations that decrease the sensitivity of vaccine-elicited neutralization and increase viral replication, raising concerns about the durability of protection provided by mRNA-based and other COVID-19 vaccines ( Baden et al., 2021a 1.

Delta (henceforth referred to by its Pango lineage, B.1.617.2) is a WHO-designated variant of concern (VOC) and is currently the dominant circulating strain of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, although it may soon be outcompeted in prevalence by Omicron (B.1.1.529). B.1.617.2 was first identified in India in October 2020 amidst substantial levels of community transmission ( Cherian et al., 2021 11. Cherian, S. ∙ Potdar, V. ∙ Jadhav, S. ...

This strain contains the mutations L452R, T478K, D614G, and P681R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and C terminus of the S1-binding subdomain. These substitutions contribute to both increased receptor binding and reduced neutralization by vaccine-elicited and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ( Ozono et al., 2021 51.

In addition, B.1.617.2 has acquired several unique mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) including T19R and G142D and a deletion at positions 156–158 accompanied by a G insertion that substantially decrease antibody binding and neutralization sensitivity ( Liu et al., 2021 43.

Neutralizing antibody titers from mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccinee sera to B.1.617.2 are reduced 3-fold compared with the vaccine-matched strain USA-WA1/2020 (WA1) shortly after immunization ( Edara et al., 2021b 23.

A 7-fold reduction in neutralizing titers to B.1.617.2 for Ad26.CoV2.S sera in comparison with WA1 or WA1 with a D614G substitution (henceforth referred to as D614G) has also been reported ( Barouch et al., 2021 4.

Recent studies in the United Kingdom, United States, and Qatar have shown a reduced efficacy of mRNA-based vaccines against asymptomatic and symptomatic, but not severe, B.1.617.2 infection ( Bruxvoort et al., 2021 8.

We and others reported that binding and neutralizing antibody titers in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans are key correlates of protection for mRNA and adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines ( Corbett et al., 2021b 16.

Commun. 2021; 12 :5877 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Retrospective analysis in Israel found that breakthrough cases in BNT162b2 vaccinees during a period of substantial B.1.617.2 transmission were statistically correlated with the length of time elapsed since vaccination, suggesting a role for waning antibody titers in vaccine efficacy reduction ( Goldberg et al., 2021 31.

Similarly, participants in the mRNA-1273 efficacy trial (COVE) who initially received a placebo prior to vaccination had reduced rates of B.1.617.2 breakthrough infections and severe disease compared with study participants who received mRNA-1273 at an earlier time ( Baden et al., 2021a 1.

These observations were consistent with previous findings showing that breakthrough infections with Alpha (B.1.1.7) were associated with lower BNT162b2-elicited binding and neutralizing antibody titers immediately prior to infection ( Bergwerk et al., 2021 6. Bergwerk, M. ∙ Gonen, T. ∙ Lustig, Y. ... Covid-19 Breakthrough Infections in Vaccinated Health Care Workers N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385 :1474-1484 Crossref Scopus (982) PubMed Google Scholar ). While BNT162b2 efficacy against breakthrough infections with B.1.617.2 has been estimated as 42% in Minnesota, USA and 51.9% in Qatar, those same studies reported mRNA-1273 efficacy as 76% and 73.1%, respectively ( Puranik et al., 2021 59.

Med. 2021; Published online November 2, 2021 Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar ). Likewise, additional analysis in California, USA indicates a mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against B.1.617.2 of 87% ( Bruxvoort et al., 2021 8. Bruxvoort, K.J. ∙ Sy, L.S. ∙ Qian, L. ... Effectiveness of mRNA-1273 against Delta, Mu, and other emerging variants medRxiv. 2021; 2021.2009.2029.21264199 Google Scholar ). While any differences between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 may diminish with increased time since vaccination, this observation warrants continued investigation. Furthermore, there is no analysis of mRNA-1273-elicited immunity out to 1 year in the context of protection against mild and severe disease in the upper and lower airways.

Thus, this model is an ideal tool for examining the effect of waning antibody titers on long-term protection in the context of a challenge with B.1.617.2.
Here, we immunized rhesus macaques with 100 μg of a pre-clinical formulation of mRNA-1273 at weeks 0 and 4 and then challenged them with B.1.617.2 approximately 1 year later. To provide insights into potential mechanisms of protection, we assessed B.1.617.2-binding antibody titers from the blood and both the upper and lower airways after vaccination and challenge. Serum neutralizing titers and the longevity of virus-specific memory B and T cell responses were also analyzed.

Section: Results

Indian-origin rhesus macaques (n = 8/group) were immunized with 100 μg mRNA-1273 or an mRNA control formulated in lipid nanoparticles at weeks 0 and 4 ( Figure S1 A). Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding titers to prefusion stabilized S protein (S-2P) of the vaccine-matched WA1 strain were assessed at weeks 6 (peak), 24 (memory), and 48 (memory and time of challenge) after vaccination. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) significantly decreased from ∼3,000 WHO International Standard binding antibody units (BAU)/mL at week 6 to ∼260 BAU/mL at week 24. However, the rate of decline was less over the next 6 months, reaching ∼188 BAU/mL at week 48 ( Figure 1 A). Seven of the 8 animals in the mRNA-1273 group had higher binding titers than all control NHPs did at week 48. The kinetics observed for WA1 RBD-binding titers showed a 130-fold reduction in geometric mean area under curve (AUC) between weeks 6 and 25 from ∼2 × 10 12 AUC to ∼1.5 × 10 10 AUC but only an additional 3-fold reduction by week 48 ( Figure 1 B). GMTs to B.1.617.2 RBD at week 6 were ∼3.7 × 10 11 AUC, a reduction of 5.4-fold compared to WA1 ( Figure 1 C). Despite the lower binding titers to B.1.617.2, antibodies retained potent function, as sera from vaccinated NHPs inhibited almost 100% of binding between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and S-2P of both variants at week 6 ( Figures S1 B–S1C).
We next measured binding titers to Beta (B.1.351), as this variant has the greatest impact on reducing neutralization by vaccinee and convalescent sera ( Geers et al., 2021 27. Geers, D. ∙ Shamier, M.C. ∙ Bogers, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern partially escape humoral but not T-cell responses in COVID-19 convalescent donors and vaccinees Sci.

Med. 2021; 384 :1899-1909 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ). At week 6, there was an 8-fold reduction in binding titers to B.1.351 RBD compared to WA1 RBD ( Figure 1 D). At week 48, GMTs to B.1.351 (∼1.2 × 10 9 AUC) were similar to B.1.617.2 (∼1.2 × 10 9 AUC) and were 4-fold less than GMTs to WA1 (∼4.6 × 10 9 AUC).
Serum neutralization of the D614G prototype virus and a panel of variants were then measured using a live virus assay. mRNA-1273-vaccinated NHPs had GMTs to D614G of 1,900 at week 6, which declined to 275 at week 24 and 200 at week 48 ( Figure 1 E). The kinetics of a rapid decline in neutralizing antibody titers during the first 6 months (week 6 versus week 24: p = 0.0002) followed by a slower decline at approximately 1 year (week 24 versus week 48: p > 0.05) were consistent with the analysis of binding titers ( Figures 1 A–1D). Compared to D614G, neutralizing GMTs to Gamma (P.1), B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 were reduced 3.3-fold, 4.1-fold, and 6.9-fold, respectively, at week 6. Neutralizing titers to B.1.617.2 declined over the following year, with 3 of the 8 NHPs having undetectable responses against B.1.617.2 at week 48 ( Figure S1 F).
Decreased serum neutralization capacity over time was substantiated with a lentiviral pseudovirus assay. At week 6, pseudovirus-neutralizing GMTs to B.1.617.2 were detectable in all NHPs but reduced 6-fold as compared to D614G (p = 0.0093). By week 24, the reduction in GMTs for B.1.617.2 compared to D614G declined to 3.5-fold, and 2 of the 8 vaccinated NHPs had undetectable neutralizing titers to B.1.617.2 at both weeks 24 and 48 ( Figures 1 F and 1G).
In contrast to the data with B.1.617.2, live virus neutralizing titers to B.1.351 showed a modest increase from week 24 to 48 (p = 0.0323). This observation, together with a difference in the kinetics of neutralizing titers to B.1.617.2 and B.1.351, suggests a change in serum epitope dominance and/or increased antibody affinity maturation, consistent with data showing a continued evolution of antibody responses induced by mRNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccines in NHPs and humans ( Barouch et al., 2021 4.

Last, antibody avidity was measured from sera over 48 weeks ( Figure 1 H). The geometric mean avidity index of WA1 S-2P-binding IgG antibodies increased from 0.6 at week 6 to 0.9 at week 24 (p < 0.0001) and was maintained through week 48 (p > 0.05), suggesting either affinity maturation within the original antibody pool or immuno-focusing toward antibodies targeting more potently neutralizing epitopes.
To explore the mechanistic basis for differences in serum neutralization and identify antibodies that could be contributing to the increased avidity, we performed serum antibody epitope mapping at weeks 6, 24, and 48 after immunization. Using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based competition assay, we determined the relative proportion (percentage of competition) of serum antibodies targeting cross-reactive epitopes on both WA1 and B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 S-2P ( Table S2 ). In this analysis, serum binding to the respective S-2P proteins is assessed in the presence of mAbs with defined binding to specific epitopes. These mAbs can compete sterically or allosterically with serum antibodies recognizing partially overlapping or nearby epitopes on S-2P.
Cross-reactive antigenic sites A, B, C, E, F, and G were defined by mAbs B1-182, CB6, A20-29.1, LY-COV555, A19-61.1, and S309, respectively, all targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S, with sites A, B, and F being associated with strong neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 ( Table S2 ) ( Corbett et al., 2021a 15.

Longitudinal analysis of the epitope-specific serum antibody responses to WA1 S-2P showed no significant differences in the relative serum reactivity over time ( Figure 2 A). This indicates that while the quantity of serum antibodies targeting WA1 S-2P decreased over time ( Figure 1 A), the composition of serum antibodies targeting cross-reactive epitopes remained unchanged.
In contrast, longitudinal analysis of serum reactivity to cross-reactive epitopes on B.1.617.2 S-2P showed significantly increased relative reactivity to antigenic sites B and F (represented by neutralizing mAbs CB6 and A19-61.1) from week 6 to 48 (B: p = 0.0026; F: p = 0.0031) ( Figure 2 B). Structural models show angles of approach for strongly neutralizing (B1-182, CB6, A19-61.1) and other mAbs (LY-COV555, S309) evaluated in complex with B.1.617.2 S-2P ( Figure 2 C). Modeling of binding footprints on B.1.617.2 RBD shows that immuno-focusing occurs on strongly neutralizing epitopes with areas of binding outside mutations T478K and L452R (CB6 and A19-61.1) ( Figure 2 D). These data indicate that although serum antibodies targeting B.1.617.2 S-2P decreased over time ( Figure 1 C), the proportion of serum antibodies targeting epitopes associated with neutralization increased, suggesting affinity maturation and immuno-focusing on conserved epitopes associated with neutralization against B.1.617.2.

Commun. 2021; 12 :5877 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine the persistence of antibody titers in these relevant anatomical sites, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal washes at weeks 6, 25, and 42. WA1 RBD IgG binding titers in the BAL were highest at week 6, with GMTs of ∼5.2 × 10 9 AUC, and declined almost 5,000-fold to ∼1.1 × 10 6 AUC by week 42 (p = 0.0007) ( Figure 3 A). B.1.617.2 RBD-binding IgG titers were lower in the BAL, with GMTs of ∼8.7 × 10 8 AUC at week 6 and ∼2.9 × 10 5 AUC at week 42, reductions of 6-fold and 4-fold compared to WA1 at the same time points ( Figures 3 C and S2 A). B.1.351 RBD-binding titers were lowest, with GMTs of ∼1.5 × 10 7 AUC at week 6 and ∼1.9 × 10 4 AUC at week 42 ( Figure S2 C). In addition, B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 RBD-binding titers followed a similar trend as WA1 RBD-binding titers with all antibody levels decreasing by week 42 (B.1.617.2: p = 0.0008; B.1.351: p = 0.0007). In contrast to the decreased antibody responses in BAL over time, WA1, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 RBD-binding titers in the nasal washes were highest at week 25 and remained stable by week 42 (week 6 versus week 42: p > 0.05) ( Figures 3 B, 3D, S2 B, and S2D).
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding IgA titers in nasal washes and BAL were also assessed ( Figures S2 E–S2H). At week 6, GMTs in the BAL of vaccinated NHPs to WA1 RBD and B.1.617.2 RBD were ∼176 and 259 AUC, respectively. At the same time, GMTs in controls were <20 AUC. IgA titers were indistinguishable from controls by week 24 in the BAL. IgA titers in the nasal washes of vaccinated NHPs were similar to those from controls at all time points.
In our previous NHP studies, we have been unable to detect neutralizing antibodies in the upper or lower airway following mRNA-1273 immunization using either pseudovirus or live virus assays. Here, we used the S-2P-ACE2 binding inhibition assay which provides a highly sensitive assessment of antibody function to extend the analysis of binding titers in the airways. Consistent with the findings from the sera ( Figures S1 B and S1C), the highest S-2P-ACE2 binding in BAL was detected at week 6 and declined by week 42 (WA1: p = 0.0043; B.1.617.2: p = 0.0168) ( Figures 3 E and 3G). By contrast, S-2P-ACE2 binding inhibition in the upper airway was not statistically different between weeks 6 and 42 ( Figures 3 F and 3H). Together, these results suggest that the kinetics and durability of antibody responses in the upper respiratory tract (nasal washes) are distinct from those in the blood or lungs (BAL).
Sustained antibody production and increased secondary responses following a vaccine boost or a viral challenge are dependent on antigen-specific memory B cell responses ( Gaebler et al., 2021 26.

A number of human studies have shown that mRNA S-2P vaccines and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection induce S-specific memory B cells that persist over time ( Dan et al., 2021 18.

Wang, Z. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ... mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants Nature. 2021; 592 :616-622 Crossref Scopus (939) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, the frequency of WA1 S- and B.1.617.2 S-specific memory B cells following mRNA-1273 vaccination in NHPs was assessed by flow cytometry using fluorescent probes ( Figure S3 A). At week 6, a median value of 2.5% of all memory B cells were dual-specific for WA-1 and B.1.617.2 in comparison to 0.14% for WA-1 and 0.09% for B.1.617.2 S-specific alone ( Figures 4 A–4D). Although the total percentage of probe-binding memory B cells decreased through week 42, the high frequency of dual-binding to single-binding cells remained constant, with a geometric mean proportion of dual-binding cells greater than 85% at all time points ( Figure 4 E). These data are consistent with recent reports that mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 elicit S-specific memory B cells that are capable of binding both the vaccine-matched strain and VOC ( Corbett et al., 2021a 15. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Gagne, M. ∙ Wagner, D.A. ... Protection against SARS-CoV-2 beta variant in mRNA-1273 vaccine-boosted nonhuman primates Science. 2021; Published online October 21, 2021 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ; Goel et al., 2021b 30.

The memory phenotype of these cells was also determined over time after vaccination ( Figure S3 B). Over the course of 1 year, S-2P-binding B cells shifted from 87% having an activated memory phenotype to a more balanced distribution of 43% activated memory, 32% resting memory, and 15% tissue-like memory cells ( Figure 4 F). Together, these data suggest that mRNA-1273 induces durable, broad cross-strain B cell memory to SARS-CoV-2.
Our previous reports showed that mRNA-1273 immunization elicits SARS-CoV-2 S-specific T helper type 1 (T H 1), CD40L + T follicular helper (T FH ), and IL-21 + T FH cells, which decrease over a 6-month period in NHPs ( Corbett et al., 2021a 15. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Gagne, M. ∙ Wagner, D.A. ... Protection against SARS-CoV-2 beta variant in mRNA-1273 vaccine-boosted nonhuman primates Science. 2021; Published online October 21, 2021 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ). Here, S-specific T cell responses were assessed through week 42 in blood and BAL ( Figure S3 C). Consistent with our prior studies, T H 1 but not T helper type 2 (T H 2) responses were detected in the blood at week 6, decreasing by week 25. T H 1 levels were low to undetectable by week 42 (week 6 versus week 42: p = 0.0261) ( Figures 5 A and 5B). mRNA-1273 induced both CD40L + and IL-21 + T FH cells at week 6. By week 42, both populations had declined (CD40L + : p = 0.0164; IL-21 + : p = 0.0166) ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Median CD8 + T cell responses in the blood were low ( Figure 5 C), although we did detect a low frequency of CD8 + T cells in the BAL at week 6 ( Figure 5 H).
We evaluated the durability of vaccine protection against B.1.617.2 containing the canonical S mutations T19R, L452R, T478K, D614G, and P681R, as well as the NTD deletion ( Figure S5 A), which were verified by sequencing. Pathogenicity of this viral stock was confirmed in hamsters ( Figure S5 C), and titration in NHPs ( Figures S5 D and S5E) was performed to define the experimental challenge dose.
mRNA-1273 and mRNA control NHPs were challenged 49 weeks after the initial immunization with 2 × 10 5 plaque forming units (PFU) of virus via intratracheal (IT) and intranasal (IN) routes ( Figure S1 A). BAL and nasal swabs (NS) were collected on days 2, 4, 7, and 14 following challenge, and qRT-PCR was used to measure viral replication by assessing subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) copies encoding for the SARS-CoV-2 E and N genes. On day 2, geometric mean sgRNA_E copies in the lower airway of controls and vaccinated NHPs were 1 × 10 6 and 9 × 10 4 per mL, respectively (p > 0.05) ( Figure 6 A). sgRNA_E copies in the lower airway of vaccinated NHPs declined rapidly over the following days, with geometric mean copies of 9 × 10 2 on day 4 and 1 × 10 2 on day 7. sgRNA_E copies in the lungs of unvaccinated NHPs remained significantly elevated compared to vaccinated NHPs, with a geometric mean of 1 × 10 5 on day 7 (mRNA-1273 versus control: p < 0.0001). These results differed from our earlier findings that NHPs vaccinated with 100 μg mRNA-1273 and then challenged only 4–8 weeks later largely controlled WA1 or B.1.351 replication in the lower airway by day 2 ( Corbett et al., 2020 14. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Flynn, B. ∙ Foulds, K.E. ... Evaluation of the mRNA-1273 Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Nonhuman Primates N. Engl. J.

Immunol. 2021; 22 :1306-1315 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In contrast to the lower airway, there was a more modest reduction in viral replication in the upper airway following mRNA-1273 immunization ( Figure 6 B). On day 2, geometric mean copies of sgRNA_E were 2 × 10 6 and 6 × 10 4 per NS of controls and vaccinated NHPs, respectively (p = 0.0038). On days 4 and 7, copies declined to 2 × 10 3 and 1 × 10 3 for the mRNA-1273 group and 4 × 10 5 and 5 × 10 4 for the control group (day 4: p = 0.006; day 7: p > 0.05). By day 7, 6 of the 8 and 4 of the 8 vaccinated NHPs had undetectable sgRNA_E levels in the lower airway and upper airway, respectively. All control NHPs still had detectable sgRNA_E copies at that time point. We observed similar trends with sgRNA_N ( Figures 6 C and 6D) but with higher geometric mean copy numbers, in agreement with our prior publications ( Corbett et al., 2021b 16. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Nason, M.C. ∙ Flach, B. ... Immune correlates of protection by mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates Science. 2021; 373 :eabj0299 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021c 17. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Werner, A.P. ∙ Connell, S.O. ... mRNA-1273 protects against SARS-CoV-2 beta infection in nonhuman primates Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1306-1315 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). We euthanized 4 of the 8 NHPs in each cohort on day 7 for an assessment of lung pathology but continued to monitor the remaining animals for an additional week. On day 14, 1 of the 4 and 2 of the 4 control NHPs had detectable sgRNA_N in the lower and upper airways, respectively. In contrast, 0 of the 4 and 1 of the 4 vaccinated NHPs had detectable sgRNA_N in the same compartments. It is noteworthy that the only animal in the mRNA-1273 cohort with detectable sgRNA_N at day 14 had undetectable pseudovirus-neutralizing antibody titers to both D614G and B.1.617.2 at week 48 ( Figure 1 F).
To provide an additional assessment of protection, we measured the tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) in samples taken from the lungs and nose on days 2 and 4 ( Figures 6 E and 6F). By day 4, only 1 of the 8 animals in the mRNA-1273 group had detectable virus in the lower airway compared to 7 of the 8 in the control mRNA group (p = 0.0048). In the upper airway, 4 of the 8 vaccinated animals had detectable virus, while all control animals had detectable virus (p = 0.0154).
We previously established binding and neutralizing antibody titers in the sera as immune correlates of protection from WA1 and B.1.351 replication in NHPs, when both challenges were given 4–8 weeks after boost ( Corbett et al., 2021b 16. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Nason, M.C. ∙ Flach, B. ... Immune correlates of protection by mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates Science. 2021; 373 :eabj0299 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021c 17. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Werner, A.P. ∙ Connell, S.O. ... mRNA-1273 protects against SARS-CoV-2 beta infection in nonhuman primates Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1306-1315 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, when B.1.617.2 challenge was approximately 1 year after mRNA-1273 vaccination, we looked to see whether these associations held between viral replication and serum WA1 S-2P-binding titers (WHO units), B.1.617.2 RBD-binding IgG titers, D614G lentiviral pseudovirus-neutralizing titers, and B.1.617.2 lentiviral pseudovirus-neutralizing titers at peak (week 6) and immediately prior to challenge (week 48) ( Figure S6 ; Table S3 ). Unlike in the challenges that were conducted soon after vaccination, none of these measurements correlated with viral replication in the lower airway. However, neutralizing titers at week 48 were significantly inversely correlated with viral replication in the upper airway at day 2 after challenge (D614G: p = 0.0149; B.1.617.2: p = 0.0446) but not on any subsequent days ( Figures S6 G and S6H).
Analysis of immune responses after challenge provides data on the kinetics of anamnestic responses, which may reveal potential mechanisms of protection. First, IgG binding titers and neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in sera at days 2, 4, 7, and 14 following challenge. We observed a clear primary response by day 14 in control NHPs, with increased binding to WA1, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 RBDs ( Figures 1 B–1D). By day 14 after challenge, B.1.617.2 GMTs had increased 37,000-fold relative to week 48 after immunization, from ∼870 to ∼3.2 × 10 7 AUC, and were higher than WA1 GMTs. In contrast, B.1.617.2 GMTs in the mRNA-1273 group had increased only 475-fold during that time span, from ∼1.2 × 10 9 AUC to ∼5.7 × 10 11 AUC, and were equivalent to WA1 GMTs at day 14. In addition, WA1 S-2P-binding GMTs in control NHPs increased 39-fold from ∼0.9 BAU/mL to ∼35 BAU/mL between week 48 after immunization and day 14 after challenge, while GMTs in vaccinated NHPs rose 5-fold from ∼189 to ∼1,030 BAU/mL ( Figure 1 A).
Pseudovirus-neutralizing responses were also measured to D614G and B.1.617.2 at days 2, 4, 7, and 14. The hierarchy of neutralizing antibody titers elicited by the vaccine remained stable until day 14, when titers to B.1.617.2 approached those of D614G (p > 0.05) ( Figure 1 F). These findings show that while serum antibody responses did not increase at a faster rate in vaccinated NHPs than in controls, they were boosted by infection.
We next measured mucosal antibody levels in the upper and lower airways. RBD-binding IgG titers in the upper airways of vaccinated animals showed a modest decline ( Figures 3 D and S2 B) despite virus persistence in the nose ( Figures 6 B, 6D, and 6F), which may reflect clearance of viral protein-bound antibodies. We detected a strikingly different trend in the lower airway, however. B.1.617.2-binding GMTs in the control group increased slowly over the post-challenge observational period, rising 18-fold to ∼230 AUC and 213-fold to ∼2,750 AUC on days 4 and 7, respectively, from pre-challenge GMTs of 12.9 AUC at week 42. The antibody binding response to B.1.617.2 in vaccinated NHPs was more rapid, rising 590-fold to ∼1.7 × 10 8 AUC on day 4 before falling to 155-fold (∼4.5 × 10 7 AUC) on day 7 compared with week 42 after immunization (∼2.9 × 10 5 AUC) ( Figure 3 C). Antibody titers to all 3 variants were significantly greater 4 days after challenge than 42 weeks after immunization in the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group (WA1: p = 0.0248; B.1.617.2: p = 0.0081; B.1.351: p = 0.0038) ( Figures 3 A, 3C, and S2 ). Last, we did not detect differential IgA responses or ACE2 binding inhibition between vaccinated animals or controls in either the lower or upper airway ( Figures 3 E–3H and S2 ). These data show that the mRNA-1273-vaccinated NHPs made an anamnestic IgG response in the lower airways.
Although the total IgG concentration in the lungs of both vaccinated and unvaccinated NHPs increased following challenge, this increase was greater in the control cohort. Geometric mean IgG concentrations in the vaccinated animals rose from 8.3 μg/mL at week 42 after immunization to 11.2 and 24.2 μg/mL on days 2 and 4 after challenge, respectively. Simultaneously, IgG concentrations in the controls rose from a baseline of 11 μg/mL to 16.2 and 73.9 μg/mL on days 2 and 4, respectively ( Figure S7 A). This rapid response after challenge is consistent with our prior experience with a protein SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in which we observed a rapid increase in both total IgG and measles morbillivirus (MeV) titers in primates that had also been vaccinated against MeV ( Francica et al., 2021 24. Francica, J.R. ∙ Flynn, B.J. ∙ Foulds, K.E. ... Protective antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination are boosted in the lung after challenge in nonhuman primates Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13 :eabi4547 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the present study, although binding titers were similar between both cohorts prior to challenge, responses to MeV increased more rapidly in the control group. GMTs to MeV in the lower airway of vaccinated NHPs increased from 14 units/mL (U/mL) at week 42 after immunization to 20 U/mL on day 4 after challenge, while GMTs in control NHPs increased from 12 to 67 U/mL at the same time points ( Figure S7 B).
An anamnestic S-specific B cell response in the lower airways would likely be the underlying mechanism for an increase in local antibody titers. While we were unable to collect a sufficient number of B cells in BAL to analyze after B.1.617.2 challenge, we were nevertheless able to interrogate these cells in blood. Memory B cells, which bound both WA1 S-2P and B.1.617.2 S-2P, dominated the S-specific immune response of vaccinated NHPs. While the total frequency of all S-binding memory B cells increased, the proportion of these dual-specific cells remained between 85%–90% ( Figure 4 E). In contrast, B.1.617.2 challenge in control NHPs elicited a higher frequency of memory B cells specific only for B.1.617.2 S, with a geometric mean frequency of 57% at day 28 ( Figure 4 E). At that time, 72% of S-binding B cells in control NHPs had a phenotype consistent with activated memory B cells, in contrast to the vaccinated cohort in which 49% of cells had an activated memory phenotype and 38% of cells had a resting memory phenotype ( Figure 4 F).
After showing a potential role for memory B cell responses in controlling virus replication in the lower airways, we also measured T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 S in the blood and BAL following challenge. By day 7, T H 1 responses were elevated as compared with week 42 in both compartments (serum: p = 0.0199; BAL: p = 0.0097). However, the range of S-specific T H 1 CD4 + T cell frequencies in the BAL of control and vaccinated NHPs overlapped ( Figures 5 A and 5F). While we observed increased IL-21 + T FH responses in vaccinated NHPs by day 7 (p = 0.0061) ( Figure 5 E), we did not detect any T H 2 responses following challenge in vaccinated or control animals (p > 0.05) ( Figures 5 B and 5G). In contrast to the minimal vaccine-elicited CD8 + T cells prior to challenge, both control and vaccinated NHPs mounted CD8 + T cell responses following challenge ( Figures 5 C and 5H). Finally, T H 1 and CD8 + responses in the lungs to SARS-CoV-2 N, which was not encoded by mRNA-1273, were only present in control NHPs ( Figure S4 ). Together, these data demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 not only elicited B and T cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 S following challenge but also protected NHPs from encountering sufficient levels of SARS-CoV-2 N to mount a primary response to that antigen.
Because sufficient virus was present in the lower airways of vaccinated NHPs to elicit both a local anamnestic antibody response and increased S-specific B and T cell populations, we assessed if mRNA-1273 vaccination protected the lungs from gross pathologic changes. Lung samples from 4 of the 8 NHPs in each group were evaluated for pathology and detection of viral antigen (VAg) 7 days after B.1.617.2 challenge. SARS-CoV-2 VAg (red arrowheads) was detected in the lungs of 4 of the 4 control animals ( Figures 7 B and 7C) and was not detected in any of the animals in the vaccinated cohort ( Figures 7 A and 7C). Inflammation ranged from minimal to moderate across lung samples from animals that received mRNA-1273 and from minimal to severe in control NHPs ( Figure 7 C). The inflammatory changes in the lungs of vaccinated NHPs were characterized by a mixture of macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells present within some alveolar spaces and mild to moderate expansion of alveolar capillaries with mild type II pneumocyte hyperplasia ( Figure 7 A). Changes in control NHPs were more consistent with lymphocytes, histiocytes, and fewer polymorphonuclear cells associated with more prominent and expanded alveolar capillaries, collections of cells with alveolar air spaces, occasional areas of perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia ( Figure 7 B). The protection observed in the lungs suggests that although binding and neutralizing antibody titers had declined 1 year after vaccination ( Figure 1 ), leaving the lower airway susceptible to virus replication in the first 2 days after challenge ( Figure 6 ), a local anamnestic response to antigen previously encountered in the vaccine proved sufficient to prevent severe disease.

Section: Discussion

mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections with B.1.617.2 is reduced compared to ancestral strains, a result of both variant-specific mutations that confer diminished sensitivity to neutralization and waning antibody titers over time following vaccination ( Baden et al., 2021a 1.

Comparison of Neutralizing Antibody Titers Elicited by mRNA and Adenoviral Vector Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 Variants bioRxiv. 2021; 2021.2007.2019.452771 Google Scholar ). Here, we studied protection against B.1.617.2 infection by mRNA-1273 almost 1 year after vaccination in NHPs. Our principal findings were: (1) protection in the lower airway was complete by day 4 but delayed compared to prior NHP studies in which viral challenges were done much closer to the time of vaccination; (2) anamnestic antibody responses were detected in BAL at day 4 in vaccinated animals; and (3) binding and neutralizing antibody titers in blood and BAL decreased over 48 weeks.
Prior studies by us and others in NHPs ( Corbett et al., 2021a 15. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Gagne, M. ∙ Wagner, D.A. ... Protection against SARS-CoV-2 beta variant in mRNA-1273 vaccine-boosted nonhuman primates Science. 2021; Published online October 21, 2021 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ) and humans ( Doria-Rose et al., 2021 21. Doria-Rose, N. ∙ Suthar, M.S. ∙ Makowski, M. ..., mRNA-1273 Study Group Antibody Persistence through 6 Months after the Second Dose of mRNA-1273 Vaccine for Covid-19 N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384 :2259-2261 Crossref Scopus (504) PubMed Google Scholar ; Goel et al., 2021b 30. Goel, R.R. ∙ Painter, M.M. ∙ Apostolidis, S.A. ..., UPenn COVID Processing Unit‡ mRNA vaccines induce durable immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern Science. 2021; 374 :abm0829 Crossref Scopus (529) PubMed Google Scholar ) show a reduction of neutralizing antibodies in sera over 6 months following mRNA vaccination. Here, antibody binding and neutralizing titers also decline in the sera over 1 year, and we extend these data by showing similar findings in BAL, suggesting that antibody measurements in serum may be a surrogate for such responses in the lung. By contrast, antibodies remain relatively stable from week 24–48 in the upper airway. The IgG stability in the nasal tract is notable considering the source of this immunoglobulin class is primarily transudation from the blood ( Renegar et al., 2004 61. Renegar, K.B. ∙ Small, Jr., P.A. ∙ Boykins, L.G. ... Role of IgA versus IgG in the control of influenza viral infection in the murine respiratory tract J. Immunol. 2004; 173 :1978-1986 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data are consistent with a prior study showing that subcutaneous vaccines elicit antibodies that are detectable in the nose for at least 6 months ( Clements and Murphy, 1986 13. Clements, M.L. ∙ Murphy, B.R. Development and persistence of local and systemic antibody responses in adults given live attenuated or inactivated influenza A virus vaccine J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 23 :66-72 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). The differential kinetics for the stability of IgG responses in the upper respiratory and lower respiratory tracts suggest unique mechanisms of turnover within these different anatomical sites.
The limited reduction in viral replication in the lower airway 2 days after challenge in this present study stands in contrast to prior studies in which mRNA-1273-vaccinated NHPs were challenged 4–8 weeks after vaccination and lower airway viral replication was largely controlled by day 2 ( Corbett et al., 2020 14. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Flynn, B. ∙ Foulds, K.E. ... Evaluation of the mRNA-1273 Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Nonhuman Primates N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :1544-1555 Crossref Scopus (801) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021c 17. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Werner, A.P. ∙ Connell, S.O. ... mRNA-1273 protects against SARS-CoV-2 beta infection in nonhuman primates Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1306-1315 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). The decline of antibody titers in the lungs over 1 year, which are replete with epithelial target cells, may explain the different kinetics in virus control. Importantly, vaccinated NHPs had a striking anamnestic antibody response in the lower airways, with a 590-fold increase in B.1.617.2 GMTs by day 4 after challenge compared with the pre-challenge time point, and there was no detectable sgRNA_E in 6 of the 8 vaccinated NHPs by day 7. This suggests that protection in the lower airway is durable but somewhat delayed and may be dependent on a recall antibody response. It is also notable that while we were able to detect binding and some functional antibodies in the blood and mucosa through the S-2P-ACE2 inhibition assay at the time of challenge, neutralizing titers to B.1.617.2 were low to undetectable. Thus, vaccine-elicited protection in the lower airway could be mediated by neutralizing antibodies below our limit of detection or through fragment crystallizable (Fc)-mediated functions, which have been shown to be important for protection with both neutralizing and non-neutralizing mAbs ( Li et al., 2021 42. Li, D. ∙ Edwards, R.J. ∙ Manne, K. ...

Winkler, E.S. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ∙ Yu, J. ... Human neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 require intact Fc effector functions for optimal therapeutic protection Cell. 2021; 184 :1804-1820.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is also noteworthy that although the quantity of antibodies had decreased 1 year after vaccination, the quality was improved, as evidenced by the increase in avidity and the shift in epitope dominance of B.1.617.2 S-binding antibodies toward sites associated with neutralization. In the nose, the 1-log 10 reduction in sgRNA_N copy numbers on days 4 and 7 was consistent with what we have observed after our prior B.1.351 challenge with the same dose and regimen of mRNA-1273 ( Corbett et al., 2021c 17. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Werner, A.P. ∙ Connell, S.O. ... mRNA-1273 protects against SARS-CoV-2 beta infection in nonhuman primates Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1306-1315 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) and shows that there is a higher threshold of antibodies required for protection in the upper airway compared to the lower airway ( Corbett et al., 2021b 16. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Nason, M.C. ∙ Flach, B. ... Immune correlates of protection by mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates Science. 2021; 373 :eabj0299 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data are also consistent with studies in human vaccinees showing that there can be a significantly higher level of protection against severe disease than mild or asymptomatic infections ( Baden et al., 2021a 1. Baden, L.R. ∙ El Sahly, H.M. ∙ Essink, B. ... Phase 3 Trial of mRNA-1273 during the Delta-Variant Surge N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; Published online November 3, 2021 Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar ; Bruxvoort et al., 2021 8. Bruxvoort, K.J. ∙ Sy, L.S. ∙ Qian, L. ...

Med. 2021; Published online November 2, 2021 Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar ).
Rapid control of virus replication in both upper and lower airways has potential implications for transmission. Smaller aerosols (<20 μm) enriched with virus are generated mainly in the lower airways, and their inhalation may lead to transmission ( Wang et al., 2021a 74. Wang, C.C. ∙ Prather, K.A. ∙ Sznitman, J. ... Airborne transmission of respiratory viruses Science. 2021; 373 :eabd9149 Crossref Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, in the context of limited virus control in the upper airway and slower kinetics of control in the lower airway, a boost to increase antibody titers may eventually be warranted.
Antibodies elicited by mRNA-1273 are capable of binding multiple VOC in NHPs and humans ( Corbett et al., 2021a 15. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Gagne, M. ∙ Wagner, D.A. ... Protection against SARS-CoV-2 beta variant in mRNA-1273 vaccine-boosted nonhuman primates Science. 2021; Published online October 21, 2021 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ; Goel et al., 2021b 30.

Wang, Z. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ... mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants Nature. 2021; 592 :616-622 Crossref Scopus (939) PubMed Google Scholar ). We extend these findings here to show that the majority of antigen-specific B cells bind both WA1 and B.1.617.2 proteins. It is noteworthy that in NHPs, there is a more substantial contraction of the S-specific memory B cell compartment following vaccination than reported for humans ( Goel et al., 2021b 30. Goel, R.R. ∙ Painter, M.M. ∙ Apostolidis, S.A. ..., UPenn COVID Processing Unit‡ mRNA vaccines induce durable immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern Science. 2021; 374 :abm0829 Crossref Scopus (529) PubMed Google Scholar ). Species-specific differences and the high percentage of memory B cells that bound SARS-CoV-2 S in our NHPs immediately after vaccination may account for these observations. Memory B cell expansion after challenge likely provides a mechanism for the anamnestic antibody response detected in BAL. Although we detected this expansion in blood, it probably reflects a similar local response in lung lymphoid tissue ( Poon et al., 2021 58. Poon, M.M.L. ∙ Rybkina, K. ∙ Kato, Y. ... SARS-CoV-2 infection generates tissue-localized immunological memory in humans Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 :eabl9105 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, the extent of anamnestic B cell activation may be dependent on the viral challenge dose and consequent virus replication.
The increase in total IgG and measles-binding titers following challenge provides further evidence of a rapid polyclonal B cell response in the lung, likely driven by Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) activation by SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus ( Bortolotti et al., 2021 7. Bortolotti, D. ∙ Gentili, V. ∙ Rizzo, S. ... TLR3 and TLR7 RNA Sensor Activation during SARS-CoV-2 Infection Microorganisms. 2021; 9 :1820 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hornung et al., 2002 36. Hornung, V. ∙ Rothenfusser, S. ∙ Britsch, S. ... Quantitative expression of toll-like receptor 1-10 mRNA in cellular subsets of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sensitivity to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides J. Immunol. 2002; 168 :4531-4537 Crossref Scopus (1683) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, transient innate stimulation of B cells in the lung may be critical for the initial adaptive immune response to respiratory pathogens and appears to precede T cell expansion.
There are multiple potential roles for T cells following vaccination by mRNA. This vaccine platform has been shown by us and others in NHPs and humans to induce T H 1 and T FH and a low frequency of CD8 + T cells. T FH cells are important for inducing and sustaining antibody responses ( Corbett et al., 2021b 16. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Nason, M.C. ∙ Flach, B. ...

Med. 2018; 215 :1571-1588 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show that S-specific T cells decreased over the course of 1 year but were still detectable in a subset of vaccinated NHPs at the time of challenge. A second potential role for T cells would be mediating the control of viral replication in the lower airway to limit severe disease. Notably, we did not see increased T H 1 or CD8 + T cell responses in the BAL of vaccinated NHPs compared with controls following challenge. Interestingly, we detected CD8 + T cells in the blood before their detection in the lungs post-challenge, which requires further investigation. A formal demonstration for whether T cells have a role in protection in the lungs would require depletion at the time of challenge.
We and others have previously shown that antibodies are a correlate of protection ( Corbett et al., 2021b 16. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Nason, M.C. ∙ Flach, B. ... Immune correlates of protection by mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates Science. 2021; 373 :eabj0299 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gilbert et al., 2021 28.

These studies are based on a short interval between vaccination and virus exposure or challenge. Here, we did not find a clear immune correlate of protection between binding or neutralizing antibody responses in the blood at the peak of the response or the time of challenge 1 year later. Additional analysis from human clinical trials with much larger numbers of vaccinated individuals than the 8 NHPs in this study will be important for determining whether serum antibody titers remain as a correlate of protection in the long term. Indeed, the data presented here raise the possibility that the correlate of protection may be due to the ability of tissue-resident memory B cells to expand after infection.
In summary, mRNA-1273 provided durable protection against B.1.617.2 challenge in the lower airway likely through anamnestic induction of antibody responses in the lung. An important consideration is that control of the virus was briefly delayed in the lungs and limited in the nose, which together may provide the virus with a greater opportunity for transmission, particularly if variants emerge that may be more transmissible, virulent, or resistant to neutralization such as B.1.1.529 ( Basile et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2021 5.

The Omicron variant is highly resistant against antibody-mediated neutralization - implications for control of the COVID-19 pandemic bioRxiv. 2021; 2021.2012.2012.472286 Google Scholar ). These concerns highlight the importance of boosting for sustaining high-level protection against severe disease and limiting mild infections and transmission.
A potential limitation relates to the extent of viral replication following B.1.617.2 challenge. The challenge stock used here was passaged once and fully matched the canonical B.1.617.2 S sequences obtained from humans. However, we did not observe greater sgRNA copy numbers in the upper airway than in previous challenges with B.1.351 or WA1 ( Corbett et al., 2021b 16. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Nason, M.C. ∙ Flach, B. ...

Clinical reports have described substantially higher viral titers in the upper respiratory tract from B.1.617.2 infections compared with ancestral strains ( Ong et al., 2021 50.

It is possible that the NHP model does not precisely recapitulate human infection.

Weight changes and clinical observations were collected daily.
All experiments conducted according to NIH regulations and standards on the humane care and use of laboratory animals as well as the Animal Care and Use Committees of the NIH Vaccine Research Center and Bioqual, Inc. (Rockville, Maryland). 4-year-old male Indian-origin rhesus macaques were housed at Bioqual, Inc. NHPs were stratified based on weight into 2 cohorts (3 NHPs per group). Groups received 1x10 5 or 1x10 6 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2. 75% of the challenge dose was resuspended in 3mL PBS and administered intratracheally, while the remaining virus was resuspended in 1mL PBS and administered intranasally, with half of the volume in each nostril. BAL fluid and nasal swabs were collected on days 2, 5, and 7 following challenge for sgRNA quantification.
VeroE6 cells were obtained from ATCC (clone E6, ATCC, #CRL-1586) and cultured in complete DMEM medium consisting of 1x DMEM (VWR, #45000-304), 10% FBS, 25mM HEPES Buffer (Corning Cellgro), 2mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1x non-essential Amino Acids, and 1x antibiotics. VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells were generated at Vaccine Research Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD. The following reagent was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate hCoV-19/Japan/TY7-503/2021 (Brazil P.1), NR-54982, contributed by National Institute of Infectious Diseases. Isolation and sequencing of EHC-083E (D614G SARS-CoV-2), B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 for live virus neutralization assays were previously described ( Edara et al., 2021a 22.

Viral titers were determined by focus-forming assay on VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells. Viral stocks were stored at −80°C until use.
We used NEBNext Ultra II RNA Prep reagents and multiplex oligos (New England Biolabs) to prepare Illumina-ready libraries, which were sequenced on a NextSeq 2000 (Illumina) as described previously ( Corbett et al., 2021c 17. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Werner, A.P. ∙ Connell, S.O. ... mRNA-1273 protects against SARS-CoV-2 beta infection in nonhuman primates Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1306-1315 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Demultiplexed sequence reads were analyzed in the CLC Genomics Workbench v.21.0.3 by (1) trimming for quality, length, and adaptor sequence, (2) mapping to the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 reference (GenBank: MN908947.3), (3) improving the mapping by local realignment in areas containing insertions and deletions (indels), and (4) generating both a sample consensus sequence and a list of variants. Default settings were used for all tools.
NHPs were challenged 49 weeks after prime with 2x10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2. 1.5x10 5 PFU was resuspended in 3 mL PBS and administered intratracheally, while 0.5x10 5 PFU was resuspended in 1 mL PBS and administered intranasally, with half of the volume in each nostril.
Determination of antibody responses in the blood and mucosa were performed as previously described for measurement of mucosal antibody responses ( Corbett et al., 2020 14. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Flynn, B. ∙ Foulds, K.E. ... Evaluation of the mRNA-1273 Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Nonhuman Primates N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :1544-1555 Crossref Scopus (801) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, heat inactivated plasma was serially diluted 1:4. BAL fluid and nasal washes were concentrated 10-fold with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Sigma) and then serially diluted 1:5. Total IgG and IgA antigen-specific antibodies to variant SARS-CoV-2 RBD-derived antigens were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using MULTI-ARRAY 384-well streptavidin-coated plates (Meso Scale Discovery, MSD). Plates were blocked with Blocker A kit (MSD) for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) and washed. Plates were then coated with variant-specific biotinylated antigens (see Table S1 ) at a concentration of 0.18 μg/mL in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at RT. After washing plates, serial dilutions of BAL fluid and nasal washes in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 (1x PBS) were added for 1 hour at RT. Plates were then washed 5 times and either 1 μg/mL anti-human IgG sulfo-tag or 2 μg/mL anti-human/NHP IgA sulfo-tag (MSD) in 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 (1x PBS) were added for 1 hour. We then washed plates 5 times, added 1x Read Buffer T (MSD), and measured chemiluminescence using MSD plate reader (Sector Imager 600). WHO international units were calculated using the MSD Reference Standard 1 against the WHO International Standard (NIBSC code: 20/136) from the V-Plex SARS-CoV-2 384 Panel 2 (IgG) kit (MSD).
Total IgG antibody titers in the BAL were quantitated by using the Human/NHP IgG Kit (MSD), and antibody titers to measles were quantitated by using the Monkey Anti-Measles IgG ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostic International) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Heat inactivated plasma was diluted 1:40. BAL fluid and nasal washes were concentrated 10-fold with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Sigma) and then diluted 1:5. ACE2 binding inhibition assay was performed with V-Plex SARS-CoV-2 Panel 13 (ACE2) Kit (MSD) per manufacturer’s instructions.
Focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) assays were performed as previously described ( Vanderheiden et al., 2020 72. Vanderheiden, A. ∙ Edara, V.V. ∙ Floyd, K. ... Development of a Rapid Focus Reduction Neutralization Test Assay for Measuring SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2020; 131 :e116 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, samples were diluted 3-fold in 8 serial dilutions using DMEM (VWR, #45000-304) in duplicates with an initial dilution of 1:10 in a total volume of 60 μl. Serially diluted samples were incubated with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 (100-200 foci per well) at 37°C for 1 hour in a round-bottomed 96-well culture plate. The antibody-virus mixture was then added to Vero cells and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Post-incubation, the antibody-virus mixture was removed and 100 μl of prewarmed 0.85% methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, #M0512-250G) overlay was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. After 24 hours, methylcellulose overlay was removed, and cells were washed three times with PBS. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 30 minutes. Following fixation, plates were washed twice with PBS and 100 μl of permeabilization buffer (0.1% BSA [VWR, #0332], Saponin [Sigma, 47036-250G-F] in PBS) was added to the fixed Vero cells for 20 minutes. Cells were incubated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 S primary antibody directly conjugated to biotin (CR3022-biotin) for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the cells were washed three times in PBS and avidin - horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added for 1 hour at room temperature followed by three washes in PBS. Foci were visualized using TrueBlue HRP substrate (KPL, # 5510-0050) and imaged on an ELISPOT reader (CTL).
Antibody neutralization was quantified by counting the number of foci for each sample using the Viridot program ( Katzelnick et al., 2018 38. Katzelnick, L.C. ∙ Coello Escoto, A. ∙ McElvany, B.D. ... Viridot: An automated virus plaque (immunofocus) counter for the measurement of serological neutralizing responses with application to dengue virus PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2018; 12 :e0006862 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). The neutralization titers were calculated as follows: 1 - (ratio of the mean number of foci in the presence of sera and foci at the highest dilution of respective sera sample). Each specimen was tested in duplicate. The FRNT 50 titers were interpolated using a 4-parameter nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3. Samples that did not neutralize at the limit of detection at 50% were plotted at 15, which was used for geometric mean calculations.
Pseudotyped lentiviral reporter viruses were produced as previously described ( Wu et al., 2021 82. Wu, K. ∙ Werner, A.P. ∙ Koch, M. ... Serum Neutralizing Activity Elicited by mRNA-1273 Vaccine N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384 :1468-1470 Crossref Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC CRL-11268) were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Promega) with the following: plasmids encoding S proteins from Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (GenBank: MN908947.3) with a p.Asp614Gly mutation, a luciferase reporter, lentivirus backbone, and the human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) genes. For pseudoviruses encoding the S from B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, the plasmid was altered via site-directed mutagenesis to match the S sequence to the corresponding variant sequence as previously described ( Corbett et al., 2021a 15. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Gagne, M. ∙ Wagner, D.A. ... Protection against SARS-CoV-2 beta variant in mRNA-1273 vaccine-boosted nonhuman primates Science. 2021; Published online October 21, 2021 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ). Plasma and/or sera, in duplicate, were tested for neutralizing activity against the pseudoviruses via mixing serial dilutions of sample with previously titrated amount of pseudovirus. After incubating for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , we added 7.5x10 3 HEK293T-ACE2 cells (Michael Farzan and Huihui Mu, Scripps Research) to each well. After 72-hour incubation, cell were lysed, and luciferase signal was measured. Neutralizing activity was calculated by quantification of luciferase activity in relative light units (RLU). The percentage of neutralization was normalized, with luciferase activity in uninfected cells defined as 100% neutralization and luciferase activity in cells infected with pseudovirus alone as 0% neutralization. ID 50 titers were calculated using a log(agonist) versus normalized-response (variable slope) nonlinear regression model in Prism v9.0.2 (GraphPad). For samples that did not neutralize at the limit of detection at 50%, a value of 20 was plotted and used for geometric mean calculations.
Avidity was measured as described previously ( Francica et al., 2021 24. Francica, J.R. ∙ Flynn, B.J. ∙ Foulds, K.E. ... Protective antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination are boosted in the lung after challenge in nonhuman primates Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13 :eabi4547 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) in an adapted ELISA assay. Briefly, ELISA against S-2P was performed in the absence or presence of sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) and developed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-monkey IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Invitrogen) and SureBlue 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) microwell peroxidase substrate (1-Component; SeraCare) and quenched with 1 N H 2 SO 4 . The avidity index (AI) was calculated by determining the ratio of IgG binding to S-2P in the absence or presence of NaSCN. The reported AI is the average of two independent experiments, each containing duplicate samples.
Serum epitope mapping competition assays were performed using the Biacore 8K+ surface plasmon resonance system (Cytiva) as previously described ( Corbett et al., 2021a 15. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Gagne, M. ∙ Wagner, D.A. ... Protection against SARS-CoV-2 beta variant in mRNA-1273 vaccine-boosted nonhuman primates Science. 2021; Published online October 21, 2021 Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar ). Briefly, anti-histidine antibody was immobilized on Series S Sensor Chip CM5 (Cytiva) through primary amine coupling using Amine Coupling and His Capture kits (Cytiva), allowing His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S protein containing 2 proline stabilization mutations (S-2P) to be captured on active sensor surface.
Competitor human IgG mAbs used for these analyses include: RBD-specific mAbs B1-182, CB6, A20-29.1, LY-COV555, A19-61.1, and S309. Negative control antibody or competitor monoclonal antibody (mAb) was injected over both active and reference surfaces. Then, NHP sera (diluted 1:100) was flowed over both active and reference sensor surfaces. Active and reference sensor surfaces were regenerated between each analysis cycle.
Beginning at the serum association phase, sensorgrams were aligned to Y (Response Units) = 0, using Biacore 8K Insights Evaluation Software (Cytiva). Relative “analyte binding late” report points (RU) were collected and used to calculate relative percent competition (% C) using the following formula: % C = [1 – (100 ∗ ((RU in presence of competitor mAb) / (RU in presence of negative control mAb)))]. Results are reported as percent competition. Assays were performed in duplicate, with average data point represented on corresponding graphs.
Previously isolated and cryopreserved PBMCs were centrifuged into warm RPMI/10% FBS and resuspended in wash buffer (4% heat inactivated newborn calf serum/0.02% NaN 3 / phenol-free RPMI). PBMCs were transferred to 96-wells, washed twice in 1X PBS, and incubated with Aqua Blue live/dead cell stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 20 minutes. Following washing, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 20 minutes at room temperature. The following antibodies were used (monoclonal unless indicated): IgD FITC (goat polyclonal, Southern Biotech), IgM PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone G20-127, BD Biosciences), IgA Dylight 405 (goat polyclonal, Jackson Immunoresearch Inc), CD20 BV570 (clone 2H7, Biolegend), CD27 BV650 (clone O323, Biolegend), CD14 BV785 (clone M5E2, Biolegend), CD16 BUV496 (clone 3G8, BD Biosciences), IgG Alexa 700 (clone G18-145, BD Biosciences), CD3 APC-Cy7 (clone SP34-2, BD Biosciences), CD38 PE (clone OKT10, Caprico Biotechnologies), CD21 PE-Cy5 (clone B-ly4, BD Biosciences), and CXCR5 PE-Cy7 (clone MU5UBEE, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were washed twice in wash buffer and then incubated with streptavidin-BV605 (BD Biosciences) labeled B.1.617.2 S-2P and streptavidin-BUV661 (BD Biosciences) labeled WA1 S-2P for 30 minutes at 4°C (protected from light). Cells were washed twice in wash buffer and residual red blood cells were lysed using BD FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences) at room temperature for 10 minutes. Following two final washes, cells were fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde (Tousimis Research Corp). All antibodies titrated to determine the optimal concentration. Samples were acquired on an BD FACSymphony cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo version 10.7.2 (BD, Ashland, OR).
Cryopreserved PBMCs and BAL cells were thawed and rested overnight in a 37°C/5% CO 2 incubator. The next morning, cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 S protein (S1 and S2, matched to vaccine insert) and N peptide pools (JPT Peptides) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml in the presence of 3 mM monensin for 6 hours. The S1, S2, and N peptide pools are comprised of 158, 157, and 102 individual peptides, respectively, as 15mers overlapping by 11 aa in 100% DMSO. Negative controls received an equal concentration of DMSO instead of peptides (final concentration of 0.5%). ICS was performed as described ( Donaldson et al., 2019 20. Donaldson, M.M. ∙ Kao, S.F. ∙ Foulds, K.E. OMIP-052: An 18-Color Panel for Measuring Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tfh Responses in Rhesus Macaques Cytometry A. 2019; 95 :261-263 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following monoclonal antibodies were used: CD3 APC-Cy7 (clone SP34-2, BD Biosciences), CD4 PE-Cy5.5 (clone S3.5, Invitrogen), CD8 BV570 (clone RPA-T8, BioLegend), CD45RA PE-Cy5 (clone 5H9, BD Biosciences), CCR7 BV650 (clone G043H7, BioLegend), CXCR5 PE (clone MU5UBEE, Thermo Fisher), CXCR3 BV711 (clone 1C6/CXCR3, BD Biosciences), PD-1 BUV737 (clone EH12.1, BD Biosciences), ICOS Pe-Cy7 (clone C398.4A, BioLegend), CD69 ECD (cloneTP1.55.3, Beckman Coulter), IFN-g Ax700 (clone B27, BioLegend), IL-2 BV750 (clone MQ1-17H12, BD Biosciences), IL-4 BB700 (clone MP4-25D2, BD Biosciences), TNF-FITC (clone Mab11, BD Biosciences), IL-13 BV421 (clone JES10-5A2, BD Biosciences), IL-17 BV605 (clone BL168, BioLegend), IL-21 Ax647 (clone 3A3-N2.1, BD Biosciences), and CD154 BV785 (clone 24-31, BioLegend). Aqua live/dead fixable dead cell stain kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to exclude dead cells. All antibodies were previously titrated to determine the optimal concentration. Samples were acquired on a BD FACSymphony flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo version 10.8.0 (BD, Ashland, OR).
BAL samples from weeks 6 and 25 were stimulated with S1 peptide pools only. One BAL sample from a vaccinated NHP on Day 2 post-challenge had extensive background staining for CD8 markers and was excluded from analysis of both S and N responses.
sgRNA was isolated and quantified as previously described ( Corbett et al., 2021c 17. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Werner, A.P. ∙ Connell, S.O. ... mRNA-1273 protects against SARS-CoV-2 beta infection in nonhuman primates Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :1306-1315 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from BAL fluid and nasal swabs using RNAzol BD column kit (Molecular Research Center). PCR reactions were conducted with TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), forward primer in the 5′ leader region, and gene-specific probes and reverse primers as follows: sgLeadSARSCoV2_F: 5′-CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC-3′
E_Sarbeco_P: 5′-FAM-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-BHQ1-3′ E_Sarbeco_R: 5′-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3′
wtN_P: 5′-FAM-TAACCAGAATGGAGAACGCAGTGGG-BHQ1-3′ wtN_R: 5′-GGTGAACCAAGACGCAGTAT-3′
Amplifications were performed with a QuantStudio 6 Pro Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The assay lower limit of detection was 50 copies per reaction.
Vero-TMPRSS2 cells (obtained from Adrian Creanga, Vaccine Research Center-NIAID) were plated at 25,000 cells/well in DMEM with 10% FBS and gentamicin, and the cultures were incubated at 37°C, 5.0% CO 2 . Media was aspirated and replaced with 180 μL of DMEM with 2% FBS and gentamicin. 10-fold serial dilutions of samples starting from 20 μL of material were added to the cells in quadruplicate and incubated at 37°C for 4 days. Positive (virus stock of known infectious titer) and negative (medium only) controls were included in each assay. The plates were incubated at 37°C, 5.0% CO 2 for 4 days. Cell monolayers were visually inspected for cytopathic effect (CPE). The TCID 50 was calculated using the Read-Muench formula.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed as described previously ( Corbett et al., 2020 14. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Flynn, B. ∙ Foulds, K.E. ... Evaluation of the mRNA-1273 Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in Nonhuman Primates N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :1544-1555 Crossref Scopus (801) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, H&E staining and IHC were conducted and analyzed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist with an Olympus BX51 light microscope. Pathologist was blinded to vaccination status of NHP. A rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (GeneTex, GTX135357) at a dilution of 1:2000 was used for IHC. Photomicrographs were taken on an Olympus DP73 camera.
Comparisons between groups, or between time points within a group, are based on unpaired and paired t-tests, respectively. All analysis for serum epitope mapping was performed using unpaired, two-tailed t-test. Binding, neutralizing, and viral assays are log-transformed as appropriate and reported with geometric means and corresponding CIs where indicated. Correlations are based on Spearman’s nonparametric rho, and the associated asymptotic p values. There are no adjustments for multiple comparisons, so all p values and significance testing should be interpreted as suggestive rather than conclusive. All analyses are conducted using R version 4.0.2 and GraphPad Prism version 8.2.0 unless otherwise specified.
P values are shown within figures, and the sample n is listed in corresponding figure legends. NS denotes that the indicated comparison was not significant, with p > 0.05. We did not perform statistical analysis at any time point in which we had samples from fewer than 5 NHPs.
