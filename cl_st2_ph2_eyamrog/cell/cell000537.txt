Title: Complement activation induces excessive T cell cytotoxicity in severe COVID-19


Abstract: Summary

Severe COVID-19 is linked to both dysfunctional immune response and unrestrained immunopathology, and it remains unclear whether T cells contribute to disease pathology. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated CD16 + T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16 + T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16 + T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16 + cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16 + T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.

Section: Introduction

Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in humans causes a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure ( Miyazawa, 2020 61. Miyazawa, M. Immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia: lessons from influenza virus infection Inflam. Regen. 2020; 40 :39 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to direct virus-induced injury to the respiratory system and other organs, increasing evidence suggests that the immune response evoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), particularly during severe disease courses ( Gustine and Jones, 2021 28.

Both CD4 + T helper cells and CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) contribute to the control of respiratory viral infections. Consequently, SARS-COV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have been associated with milder COVID-19 ( Jacob, 2020 35. Jacob, C.O. On the genetics and immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 Clin.

Although this had been interpreted as a predominantly protective role of T cell responses ( Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020 73. Rydyznski Moderbacher, C. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ∙ Dan, J.M. ...

Med. 2020; 1 :100092 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extent of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses could not be directly tied to disease severity, with high T cell numbers not necessarily translating into mild COVID-19 ( Le Bert et al., 2021 46. Le Bert, N. ∙ Clapham, H.E. ∙ Tan, A.T. ... Highly functional virus-specific cellular immune response in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 , e20202617 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, the number of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were found to be comparable or even higher in COVID-19 patients displaying severe versus mild disease ( Feng et al., 2020 19. Feng, Z. ∙ Diao, B. ∙ Wang, R. ...

Med. 2020; 1 :100092 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A higher state of T cell activation in all T cell compartments (CD4 + , CD8 + , double-negative) in patients progressing to severe COVID-19 was reported ( Zenarruzabeitia et al., 2021 104. Zenarruzabeitia, O. ∙ Astarloa-Pando, G. ∙ Terrén, I. ... T cell activation, highly armed cytotoxic cells and a shift in monocytes CD300 receptors expression is characteristic of patients with severe COVID-19 Front. Immunol. 2021; 12 :655934 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interstitial T cell infiltration is observed in pathological specimens of COVID-19 pneumonia along with macrophage accumulation in the alveolar space, and it has been hypothesized that infiltrating T cells also contribute to alveolar wall damage and endothelial cell injury known as lymphocytic endotheliitis ( Miyazawa, 2020 61. Miyazawa, M. Immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia: lessons from influenza virus infection Inflam. Regen. 2020; 40 :39 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Varga et al., 2020 94. Varga, Z. ∙ Flammer, A.J. ∙ Steiger, P. ... Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19 Lancet. 2020; 395 :1417-1418 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2733) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All this argues for a complex relationship between T cell immune responses and disease outcome during COVID-19 beyond a mere quantitative influence. It is likely that additional factors present in the microenvironment shape the quality of T cell responses and consequently impact pathology. Therefore, it is important to identify whether and which T cell subsets have a pathogenic role. Also, mechanisms by which potentially pathogenic T cells are induced need to be revealed, as studies on this matter are currently lacking ( Yan et al., 2021 100. Yan, B. ∙ Freiwald, T. ∙ Chauss, D. ... SARS-CoV-2 drives JAK1/2-dependent local complement hyperactivation Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 , eabg0833 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we combined single-cell proteomics and transcriptomics with mechanistic studies to reveal alterations in the T cell compartment, their upstream signals, and functional relevance, which explain important immunopathological features observed in severe COVID-19. Mass cytometry (cytometry by time of flight [CyTOF]) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) combined with VDJ-sequencing (VDJ-seq)-based T cell clonotype identification were used to determine COVID-19- and severity-specific alterations in the T cell compartment. In addition to the severity-independent formation of highly activated HLA-DR hi CD38 hi CD137 + Ki67 + T follicular helper (TFH)-like cells and CD8 + CTLs in COVID-19, we describe a C3a-driven induction of activated CD16 expressing cells in patients with severe COVID-19. These T cells display increased immune complex-mediated, TCR-independent cytotoxicity causing activation and release of chemokines by lung endothelial cells. This mechanism may contribute to the profound lung damage and endotheliitis observed in patients with severe COVID-19.

Section: Results

We performed CyTOF of whole blood samples from mild and severe COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phase, alongside patients with other acute respiratory infections (Flu-like illness ), as well as patients chronically infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B (HBV) and controls ( Figure 1 A). We previously reported that T cell numbers were reduced in acute COVID-19 compared with controls ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 77. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ... Severe COVID-19 is marked by a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment Cell. 2020; 182 :1419-1440.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further interrogate the T cell space, acquired T cells (CD45 + CD3 + CD19 − CD15 − ) were pre-gated into CD4 + T helper cells (CD3 + , CD8 − TCRgd − ), CD8 + CTLs (CD3 + , CD8 + TCRgd − ), and TCRgd + (CD3 − , CD8 − TCRgd + ) cells. Unsupervised clustering analysis on samples from control, FLI, HIV, HBV, and acute COVID-19 using 29 surface antigens and the proliferation marker Ki67 partitioned the pre-gated T helper cells, CTLs, and TCRgd + T cells into 19, 15, and 14 individual cell clusters, respectively ( Figures 1 B–1D). A significant proportion of cells from patients with mild or severe COVID-19 were clearly separated in Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) space from those of the other patient groups or controls ( Figure 1 B).
Samples of COVID-19 patients collected during the first three weeks after symptom onset independent of the severity were characterized by increased proportions of CD4 + T cell cluster 7 (CD38 hi HLA-DR + Ki67 + ICOS + ) compared with other infections or controls, whereas the abundance of cluster 18 (CD27 − CD25 + ) was lower ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Cluster 7 T cells are characterized by high expression of activation markers such as HLA-DR, CD38, CD137, CD69, and Ki67. Furthermore, the T cells in this cluster express CXCR5, ICOS, and PD-1, resembling TFH-like cells. The increase of TFH-like cells was not seen for FLI, neither HIV, nor HBV. T helper cells in severe COVID-19 patients showed higher proportions of cluster 8 T cells (CD4 + , highly activated natural killer T cell [NKT-like]), which in addition to the expression of CD38, HLA-DR, CD137, CD69, Ki67, and CXCR3, were characterized by high levels of CCR6 and CD16. Those T cells belong to the CD62L + CD45RO + central memory metacluster, reflecting a more recent differentiation. In contrast, in patients suffering from chronic HIV or HBV infection we observed a tendency toward a higher proportion of cluster 19 (TIGIT + CD38 + CD16 + ). T cells from this cluster were classified as terminally differentiated RA + cells, expressed low levels of CD16, and showed no signs of recent activation.
This activation pattern was not restricted to the CD4 + T cell compartment and was also detectable in CD8 + CTLs and TCRgd + T cells. Both mild and severe COVID-19 patients displayed increased proportions of cluster 25 T cells (CD8 + CD38 hi HLA-DR + Ki67 + ) in comparison with the other groups ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Severe COVID-19 was further characterized by increased abundance of cluster 26 T cells (CD8 + , highly activated NKT-like), also expressing high levels of CCR6 and CD16. We observed that severity explained on average 96% of the variance in cluster frequencies, whereas age only 4% ( Figure S1 A), indicating that the increased proportions of activated CD16 + T cells are mainly due to disease severity and not to age.
We confirmed the existence of a CD3 + CD16 + HLA-DR + T cell population by flow cytometry in a second cohort of COVID-19 patients ( Figure S1 B).
Time-dependent analysis of the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell clusters revealed a trend to faster accumulation of the activated CD38 hi HLA-DR + Ki67 + -expressing clusters 7 and 25 during the first week after SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe versus mild COVID-19 ( Figures S1 C and S1D). In contrast, the highly activated CD16 + NKT-like CD4 + and CD8 + T clusters appeared only during the second week of infection.
Our findings concerning the identification of highly activated and proliferating T helper cells and CTLs after SARS-CoV-2 infection is in line with recent reports ( Mathew et al., 2020 58. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ...

Stephenson, E. ∙ Reynolds, G. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell multi-omics analysis of the immune response in COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :904-916 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, we uncovered a unique activation and differentiation program in a subset of T cells across all three major T cell compartments (T helper cells, CTLs, and TCRgd + T cells), characterized by CD16 and CCR6 expression in severe COVID-19. As the increase of highly activated CD16 + T cell clusters in severe COVID-19 versus control or mild COVID-19 samples was only significant for the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and not the TCRgd + T cells, we focused our subsequent analyzes on the former two compartments.
To obtain functional information on the COVID-19- and severity-specific T cell clusters, we performed scRNA-seq analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples as well as purified CD38 expressing T cells from acutely infected and convalescent mild and severe COVID-19, as well as FLI, HBV, and controls. To align the CyTOF and scRNA-seq T cell clusters, we applied a feature-based cluster annotation approach on the whole T cell space from PBMC and CD38 + T cell libraries ( STAR Methods ), which resulted in 17 clusters ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The proportion of T cells belonging to clusters 7, 8, and 10 was higher in COVID-19 patients compared with FLI or HBV patients as well as controls ( Figures 2 D and 2E). We observed other T cell clusters with FCGR3A expression (clusters 9, 11, 12, and 13). Of these, only cluster 9 transcribed SELL (CD62L) and displayed a central memory phenotype, whereas clusters 11, 12, and 13 T cells displayed a more advanced differentiation profile. Overall, cluster 7 contains TFH-like cells similar to the CyTOF cluster 7, whereas cluster 8, 9, and 10 most likely contain a mixture of highly activated and CD16 + NKT-like cells with similarities to the CyTOF clusters 8, 24, and 25. Next, we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis across clusters 7, 8, 9, and 10, comparing mild and severe COVID-19 T cells ( Figure 2 F). Interestingly, whereas T cells from mild patients showed an enrichment for cellular responses to type I interferon and antiviral defense, we observed a specific enrichment of genes involved in degranulation in severe COVID-19 T cells. This selective enrichment was validated by a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for genes belonging to the GO terms “response to type I interferon” and “defense response to virus,” which were enriched in mild, and for genes belonging to a cytotoxicity signature, which were enriched in severe COVID-19 T cells (all p_adj < 0.005, Figure 2 G). Indeed, several genes that are known to promote degranulation ( LAMP1 and STX11 ) or exert cytotoxic potential ( PRF1 , GZMB , GZMH , and GZMK ) were increased in severe COVID-19 across clusters 7, 8, 9, and 10 T cells ( Figures 2 H and S2 B) or the whole T cell space ( Figure S2 C). We validated these findings in scRNA-seq data from our second cohort ( Figure S3 ). Here, clusters 6 and 7 contained CD4 + T cells transcribing ICOS , CD40LG , PDCD1 , and CXCR5 and, thus, resembled cluster 7 T cells from cohort 1, although the expression level of CD38 and HLA-DR genes seemed to be lower. Clusters 10 and 13 from the second cohort resembled clusters 10 and 8 in cohort 1, respectively. Furthermore, GSEA similarly showed increased expression of genes mediating cytotoxicity in severe COVID-19 T cells across these clusters ( Figures S3 E and S3F).
Thus, scRNA-seq analysis of samples from two independent cohorts supported our finding of a subset of activated CD16 + T cells across the major T cell compartments in severe COVID-19 and identified an increase in cytotoxicity-associated transcriptional programs.
CyTOF and scRNA-seq analyses identified two main T cell activation features: (1) formation of highly activated, proliferating TFH-like CD4 + cells and CXCR3 expressing CTLs independent of disease severity, and (2) activated CD16 + T cells specific for severe COVID-19. Because TFH cells promote B cell help ( Crotty, 2014 13. Crotty, S. T follicular helper cell differentiation, function, and roles in disease Immunity. 2014; 41 :529-542 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (976) PubMed Google Scholar ) and because we observed a trend for a faster formation of activated TFH-like cells in severe COVID-19 patient samples, we tested whether SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses were more pronounced in those patients. Serum concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, but particular IgG levels were higher in severe COVID-19 ( Figure 3 A), which is in line with previous reports ( Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021 23. Garcia-Beltran, W.F. ∙ Lam, E.C. ∙ Astudillo, M.G. ... COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies predict disease severity and survival Cell. 2021; 184 :476-488.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, maximal antibody levels determined during the second week post-symptom onset correlated positively with the cell proportions of the TFH-like CyTOF cluster 7 ( Figure 3 B), whereas the CD16 + CD4 + T cell cluster 8 did not correlate with antibody levels (IgA: R 2 = 0.11, p = 0.19; IgG: R 2 = 0.18, p = 0.08; data not shown). Although severe COVID-19 patients developed a faster antibody response, all study cohort patients were reactive (optical density ratios > 1.1) at later time points.
Next, we investigated the functional properties related to the CD16 + CD4 + and CD8 + clusters. As indicated by scRNA-seq, samples from patients with severe COVID-19 contained significantly more Granzyme B expressing CD8 + T cells compared with controls ( Figure 3 C). Because CD16 is known to mediate antibody-mediated degranulation of NK cells ( Moretta et al., 2008 63. Moretta, A. ∙ Marcenaro, E. ∙ Parolini, S. ... NK cells at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15 :226-233 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested whether T cells from patients with severe COVID-19 display enhanced CD16-dependent degranulation potential. As a surrogate for immune complex-mediated stimulation, we assessed cell surface CD107a in PBMCs from mild or severe patients as well as controls after 6 h incubation with anti-CD16 antibody or isotype antibody-coated beads ( Figure 3 D). Stimulation with anti-CD16 elicited strong degranulation of CD8 + T cells from patients with severe COVID-19, compared with T cells from non-infected controls ( Figure 3 D). T cells from patients with mild COVID-19 showed intermediate degranulation potential. As a second approach to assessing immune-complex-mediated degranulation, we stimulated T cells with SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein-coated beads complexed with patient-derived serum. Serum from COVID-19 patients induced similar degranulation as anti-CD16 antibody-coated beads, which was not observed with serum from uninfected controls ( Figure 3 E).
We also investigated SARS-CoV-2 specificity of activated CD16 + T cells. PBMCs from mild and severe COVID-19 patients were restimulated with a SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool and the proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8 + CD38 + CD16 + T cells (CD137 + CD69 + ) was determined after 24 h. On average 5% of the T cells upregulated CD137 and CD69 expression. The level of SARS-CoV-2- specificity among CD38 + CD16 + T cells was similar in patients with severe and mild COVID-19, yet the absolute number of activated CD16 + T cells was 4-fold higher in patients with severe disease. When comparing the frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells between the total CD8 + , activated CD16 − (CD38 + CD16 − ) and activated CD16 + (CD38 + CD16 + ) compartment, we detected a significant enrichment in activated CD16 + T cells but not activated CD16 − T cells compared with total CD8 + T cells in samples of patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 3 F).
One of the most likely implications of CD16 engagement in severe COVID-19 is enhanced T cell degranulation during interaction with endothelial cells ( Bagnato and Harari, 2015 5. Bagnato, G. ∙ Harari, S. Cellular interactions in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung diseases Eur. Respir. Rev. 2015; 24 :102-114 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ; Degauque et al., 2021 15. Degauque, N. ∙ Haziot, A. ∙ Brouard, S. ... Endothelial cell, myeloid, and adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection FASEB J. 2021; 35 , e21577 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, based on findings from autopsies in severe COVID-19, T cell infiltration along with endothelial cell injury known as lymphocytic endotheliitis has been observed ( Miyazawa, 2020 61. Miyazawa, M. Immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia: lessons from influenza virus infection Inflam. Regen. 2020; 40 :39 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Varga et al., 2020 94. Varga, Z. ∙ Flammer, A.J. ∙ Steiger, P. ... Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19 Lancet. 2020; 395 :1417-1418 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2733) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is, therefore, conceivable that immune complex-mediated degranulation of CD16 + T cells contributes to endothelial injury. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured primary lung microvascular endothelial cells with enriched non-naive CD8 + T cells isolated from patients with mild or severe COVID-19 or controls in the presence of anti-CD16 antibodies. Subsequently, we analyzed the release of inflammatory mediators ( Figure 3 G). Anti-CD16-triggered severe COVID-19 T cells elicited enhanced CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL2 (MCP-1) release by co-cultured endothelial cells. Chemokines were produced by endothelial cells, as we did not observe chemokine release by anti-CD16-triggered T cells alone (below <0.4 pg/mL for CXCL8 and <1.9 pg/mL for CCL2). T cells from COVID-19 patients amplified Concanavalin A-induced loss of transendothelial electrical resistance, indicating endothelial barrier disruption, as compared with control T cells, but this effect was only significant for T cells from patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 3 H).
Complementing our findings in peripheral blood, we investigated the tissue localization of CD16 + T cells in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. We co-stained CD3 and CD16 in autopsy lung tissues from COVID-19 patients and from three different cohorts of non-COVID patients, i.e., patients without inflammatory or fibrotic lung disease (control), patients with non-infectious ARDS, and influenza pneumonia (either H1N1 or seasonal influenza) positive patients (FLU). In autopsy lung tissue from COVID-19 patients, we found an increased number of CD3 + CD16 + T lymphocytes in comparison with lung tissue from the different control autopsy groups ( Figures 3 I and 3J). The pulmonary accumulation of CD3 + /CD16 + cells was most prominent in autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients between 7 and 14 days and declined at late time points of death ( Figure 3 J).
We also made use of a published scRNA-seq dataset of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia ( Wauters et al., 2021 97. Wauters, E. ∙ Van Mol, P. ∙ Garg, A.D. ... Discriminating mild from critical COVID-19 by innate and adaptive immune single-cell profiling of bronchoalveolar lavages Cell Res. 2021; 31 :272-290 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) to investigate T cells and their phenotypes ( STAR Methods ; data and code availability). Whereas most T cell clusters contained CD38 and HLA-DRA transcribing cells, FCGR3A expression was roughly confined to clusters 3, 6, 10, and 11. The abundance of clusters 3, 10, and 11 was higher in COVID-19 samples. Cluster 10, showing the strongest enrichment in COVID-19 samples, was characterized by the highest FCGR3A expression. T cells belonging to this cluster transcribed nearly all genes of the cytotoxicity signature including LAMP1 (CD107A) at the highest level.
These findings support our hypothesis of an enhanced generation and local accumulation of CD16 + , highly cytotoxic T cells in patients with severe COVID-19, which can induce activation and injury of lung endothelial cells. T-cell-induced release of chemoattractants CXCL8 and CCL2 can contribute to increased infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes in COVID-19 pneumonia.
Knowing that CD16 + T cells from severe COVID-19 patients display enhanced cytotoxic properties potentially contributing to organ damage, we analyzed their persistence after clearance of the acute infection. We obtained VDJ sequence information in addition to the gene expression data of T cells from acute and convalescent samples of mild and severe COVID-19 as well as FLI, HBV, and controls, allowing us to study the fate of early expanded T cell clones during convalescence at months 3–8 post-symptom onset ( Figures 4 A–4E). First, we analyzed whether the individual COVID-19 T cell clusters differ in their clonal enrichment. The FCGR3A expressing scRNA-seq clusters enriched in patients with COVID-19 (8, 9, and 10) showed a high level of clonal enrichment during acute COVID-19 infection, whereas it was rather low for cluster 7, containing CD4 + TFH-like cells ( Figure 4 A). Consequently, only clones belonging to clusters 8, 9, and 10, composed of mixed CD4 / CD8A or CD8A /TCRgd T cell clusters, displayed a high degree of persistence with up to 50% of the TCR clones being recovered in convalescent samples ( Figure 4 B). Furthermore, clones expanded in the highly proliferating cluster 9 showed a higher persistence in severe COVID-19 patients ( Figure 4 B). Following the clone-specific VDJ sequences also allowed us to track their differentiation trajectory during convalescence ( Figures 4 C and 4D). T cells expanded during the acute infection belonging to clusters 7–10 dropped dramatically during convalescence ( Figure 4 D), the respective T cell clones evolved into T cells mainly identified in clusters 11 and 12, which retained FCGR3A expression ( Figures 4 C and 4D). GSEA further revealed the high cytotoxic potential of these clones, among clusters 6, 11, and 12 T cells of COVID-19 patients versus controls, with an evident difference even when comparing severe versus mild COVID-19 (p_adj < 0.01, Figure 4 E).
Using the VDJ sequence information allowed us also to define whether the activated FCGR3A + clusters are mainly composed of NKT cells known to show innate immune cell functions ( Krovi and Gapin, 2018 43. Krovi, S.H. ∙ Gapin, L. Invariant natural killer T cell subsets-more than just developmental intermediates Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1393 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). With the vast majority of iNKT cells expressing an identical TCRα chain ( TRAV10-TRAJ18 ) paired to a restricted set of TCRβ chains ( TRBV25 ), we determined the proportion of TRAV10-TRAJ18-TRBV25 pairing T cell clones across all T cell clusters. The median proportion of all T cells in our dataset expressing the TCR alpha-beta pair was 0.04%. We did not observe a major iNKT cell enrichment in the described COVID-19 T cell clusters 7–10, with the highest frequency of 0.03% in cluster 7.
Furthermore, we labeled cells from samples during COVID-19 convalescence with the CyTOF clusters previously found via k-nearest neighbor ( Figures 4 F and S4 A). Similar to our scRNA-seq findings, we observed alterations in T cell cluster abundances during convalescence. For CD8 + T cells, we observed a strong increase in T cell proportions for cluster 29, which belongs to the effector memory meta cluster and is characterized by PD-1, TIGIT as well as CD137 expression. In line with the scRNA-seq data, proportions of highly activated (clusters 7 and 25) and CD16 + NKT-like (clusters 8 and 26) CD4 + and CD8 + clusters decreased in the convalescent phase. However, CD16 + T cells did not disappear. In the CD4 + T cell compartment, we observed an increase in the CD16 + late differentiated T EMRA cluster 19, which was more pronounced in severe COVID-19 patients. Similarly, proportions of T cells belonging to the CD8 + CD16 + T EMRA cluster 33 were higher in the convalescent phase.
Thus, CD16 + CD8 + T cells of severe COVID-19 patients persist during convalescence, adopt a more differentiated, CD62L − phenotype but maintain their high cytotoxic potential.
Because mortality and severe morbidity in COVID-19 disproportionately affect older individuals ( Nanda et al., 2020 64. Nanda, A. ∙ Vura, N.V.R.K. ∙ Gravenstein, S. COVID-19 in older adults Aging Clin. Exp. Res. 2020; 32 :1199-1202 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), we investigated whether the formation of total CD16 + T cells is associated with increased age. We utilized published flow cytometry data ( Kverneland et al., 2016 45. Kverneland, A.H. ∙ Streitz, M. ∙ Geissler, E. ... Age and gender leucocytes variances and references values generated using the standardized one-study protocol Cytometry A. 2016; 89 :543-564 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), which revealed some CD16 + CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in controls, yet at very low proportions ( Figure 5 A). Especially for CD8 + T cells, we detected significantly higher proportions of CD16 + cells in samples from older individuals, supporting our hypothesis of an age-dependent increase. Those are total CD16 + T cells, which cannot directly be compared with the proportions of activated CD16 + CyTOF clusters. It shows, however, that CD16 + T cells accumulate during aging.
A key feature of severe COVID-19 is increased complement generation and activation ( Carvelli et al., 2020 10. Carvelli, J. ∙ Demaria, O. ∙ Vély, F. ... Association of COVID-19 inflammation with activation of the C5a-C5aR1 axis Nature. 2020; 588 :146-150 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2021 53.

Complement overactivation and consumption predicts in-hospital mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection Front. Immunol. 2021; 12 :663187 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). The complement system is an integral part of the innate immune defense but its effector functions also extend to an instruction of the adaptive immune system ( Lubbers et al., 2017 52. Lubbers, R. ∙ van Essen, M.F. ∙ van Kooten, C. ... Production of complement components by cells of the immune system Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2017; 188 :183-194 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, complement enhances T cell activation as T cells are known to express receptors for C3a and C3b ( Arbore et al., 2018 4. Arbore, G. ∙ West, E.E. ∙ Rahman, J. ... Complement receptor CD46 co-stimulates optimal human CD8+ T cell effector function via fatty acid metabolism Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4186 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hess and Kemper, 2016 31. Hess, C. ∙ Kemper, C.

West, E.E. ∙ Kolev, M. ∙ Kemper, C. Complement and the regulation of T cell responses Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :309-338 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To corroborate a potential link between aging and complement activity, we analyzed the correlation of the complement component complement factor D (CFD) with age in the generation Scotland study ( Figure 5 B; Messner et al., 2020 60. Messner, C.B. ∙ Demichev, V. ∙ Wendisch, D. ... Ultra-high-throughput clinical proteomics reveals classifiers of COVID-19 infection Cell Syst. 2020; 11 :11-24.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ), which revealed a clear age-dependent increase of CFD. We then extended these findings to COVID-19 patients and showed that particularly severe COVID-19 at early time points was characterized by significantly elevated CFD plasma concentrations ( Figure 5 C, left panel).
CFD is a serine protease that catalyzes the formation of the active C3 convertase in the alternative pathway ( Noris and Remuzzi, 2013 65. Noris, M. ∙ Remuzzi, G. Overview of complement activation and regulation Semin. Nephrol. 2013; 33 :479-492 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (375) PubMed Google Scholar ). C3a plasma levels detected in severe COVID-19 patients during the first three weeks after symptom onset exceeded C3a levels detected in mild COVID-19 or other acute respiratory infections ( Figure 5 C, middle panel). C5a levels peaked in week three post-onset of symptoms but did not reach significance ( Figure 5 C, right panel). Both, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from COVID-19 patients regardless of disease severity displayed higher C3a binding potential than cells from controls ( Figure 5 D). Finally, plasma C3a levels in COVID-19 patients measured at week 2 post-symptom onset correlated with proportions of COVID-19-specific activated CD16 expressing CD4 + and CD8 + CyTOF clusters (cluster 8+26) ( Figure 5 E).
Next, we stimulated enriched CD3 + cells from healthy unexposed controls with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies in the presence of recombinant IL-2 and serum from mild or severe COVID-19 patients or control serum. The addition of serum from severe COVID-19 patients resulted in a 10- and 20-fold increase of CD16 + T cells, which was higher compared with the increase observed when adding serum from mild COVID-19 patients ( Figure 5 F). Furthermore, the addition of recombinant C3a to cells stimulated in the presence of control serum enhanced the formation of CD16 + T cells ( Figure 5 F). The in vitro -generated T cells phenotypically and functionally resembled the T cells identified by CyTOF in severe COVID-19 patients displaying a higher degranulation potential ( Figure 5 G).
Finally, we tested whether C3a is responsible for the altered T cell differentiation potential of serum from patients with severe COVID-19. Neutralization of C3a reduced CD16 + T cells in most T cell differentiation cultures ( Figure 5 H).
In summary, complement split products, such as C3a, produced at high levels in severe COVID-19 generate an inflammatory milieu that promotes differentiation of CD16 + , highly cytotoxic T cells.
We compared proportions of activated CD16 + T cells ( STAR Methods ) in patients who died from COVID-19 and those who survived. We observed significantly higher percentages of activated CD16 + TCRab + cells among all CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in samples from severe COVID-19 patients who died (non-survivor) compared with those who survived (survivor) ( Figure 6 A, right panel). Furthermore, proportions of CD3 + CD16 + HLA-DR + T cells measured by multicolor flow cytometry ( Figure S4 B) and activated FCGR3A expressing scRNA-seq clusters ( Figure S4 C) in samples from cohort 2 showed a trend to be higher in severe COVID-19 patients who deceased during follow up.
Next, we tested in a larger cohort whether plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a generation are associated with patient disease course and outcome. Levels of positive regulators of the classical and alternative pathway, such as C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, C1R, and CFD, were higher in plasma samples of patients with severe compared with mild COVID-19 ( Figure 6 B). We also analyzed complement protein levels in relation to disease trajectory, specifically subsequent worsening of disease severity. C1R and CFD were elevated in samples from patients who showed a clinical deterioration, whereas the abundance of complement factor I (CFI), which inhibits the classical and lectin-dependent complement pathway, was lower in samples from patients with subsequent disease progression ( Figure 6 C). Finally, amounts of C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, and CFD were not only higher in severe COVID-19 but were also associated with fatal outcome ( Figure 6 D).
Altogether these data further support the pathological role of the complement system and of activated CD16 + T cells during severe COVID-19.

Section: Discussion

Excessive T cell activation and altered phenotypes can contribute to infection-associated organ damage. Early after the first reports on immune profiles of COVID-19 patients ( Sette and Crotty, 2021 79. Sette, A. ∙ Crotty, S. Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Cell. 2021; 184 :861-880 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ) discussions on their putative role in immune protection versus pathology started. In our study, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection—in contrast to other acute and chronic infections—promotes the formation of highly activated and proliferating HLA-DR + CD38 hi CD137 + CD69 + T helper cells and CD8 + T cells independent of disease severity, although this response occurred faster in severe COVID-19 patients. More importantly, in severe COVID-19 patients, we detected differentiation of activated CD16 + T cells, which showed an increased immune complex-mediated cytotoxic potential and a potential to activate lung microvascular endothelial cells. Expanded clones within the CD16 + T cell compartment persisted and maintained their high cytotoxic potential. We identified C3a as an upstream signal for the differentiation of the altered activated T cell phenotype. Proportions of activated CD16 + T cells and plasma complement protein abundance levels were associated with worse outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-triggered complement activation creates an inflammatory milieu that drives differentiation of T cells with high immunopathogenic potential.
A balanced T cell activation is decisive for the course of infection. The formation of CD8 + tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) during primary infection is known to restrain viral spread upon secondary influenza infections. Yet, enhanced accumulation of Trm cells in an imbalanced environment such as during aging can support excessive inflammation leading to organ damage and impaired repair ( Goplen et al., 2020 25. Goplen, N.P. ∙ Wu, Y. ∙ Son, Y.M. ... Tissue-resident CD8+ T cells drive age-associated chronic lung sequelae after viral pneumonia Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 , eabc4557 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In COVID-19, large numbers of such Trm-like CD8 + T cells have been identified in the airways ( Liao et al., 2020 50. Liao, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Yuan, J. ... Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :842-844 Crossref Scopus (818) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Blood samples acquired during the acute phase of severe COVID-19 contain high numbers of HLA-DR + CD38 hi Ki67 + in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell compartments ( Mathew et al., 2020 58. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ...

Stephenson, E. ∙ Reynolds, G. ∙ Botting, R.A. ... Single-cell multi-omics analysis of the immune response in COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :904-916 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), a finding that we corroborated by CyTOF analysis. Severe COVID-19 patients showed a faster increase of the CD38 hi HLA-DR + Ki67 + ICOS + TFH-like CyTOF cluster 7 proportions accompanied by an earlier antibody response ( Figures 5 A and S1 B). We identified an elevated and activated T cell population expressing CD16 across the three major T cell compartments. Activated CD16 + T cells showed increased TCR-independent pathogenic potential.
The activated CD16 + CD4 + and CD8 + T cells enriched in severe COVID-19 expressed high levels of chemokine receptors such as CXCR3 and CCR6 ( Figure 1 D). This clearly distinguished them from the other CD16 lo T cell clusters, e.g., cluster 31. CXCR3 and CCR6 might promote the migration of activated CD16 + T cells into the inflamed lungs ( Oja et al., 2018 67. Oja, A.E. ∙ Piet, B. ∙ Helbig, C. ... Trigger-happy resident memory CD4+ T cells inhabit the human lungs Mucosal Immunol. 2018; 11 :654-667 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shanmugasundaram et al., 2020 80. Shanmugasundaram, U. ∙ Bucsan, A.N. ∙ Ganatra, S.R. ... Pulmonary mycobacterium tuberculosis control associates with CXCR3- and CCR6-expressing antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 cell recruitment JCI Insight. 2020; 5 , e137858 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Pronounced CCR6 expression on T cells has been described in severe COVID-19 ( Fenoglio et al., 2021 20. Fenoglio, D. ∙ Dentone, C. ∙ Parodi, A. ... Characterization of T lymphocytes in severe COVID-19 patients J. Med. Virol. 2021; 93 :5608-5613 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tiwari-Heckler et al., 2021 92. Tiwari-Heckler, S. ∙ Rauber, C. ∙ Longhi, M.S. ... Dysregulated Host Response in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Induced Critical Illness Open Forum Infect. Dis. 2021; 8 :ofab019 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ), which we can link here to unexpected phenotypic and functional properties. Immunofluorescence co-staining of CD3 and CD16 in lung samples of an autopsy cohort showed enrichment of CD3 + CD16 + T cells in COVID-19 compared with influenza pneumonia or other causes of ARDS ( Figures 3 I and 3J). Although strong T cell activation is a feature of both severe COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia, specific differences have been described between both diseases ( Youngs et al., 2021 101. Youngs, J. ∙ Provine, N.M. ∙ Lim, N. ... Identification of immune correlates of fatal outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 , e1009804 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We found that approximately 5% of the activated CD16 + CD8 + T cells respond to stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides. This is in line with the previously described positive correlation between ex vivo -determined HLA-DR + CD38 hi Ki67 + CD8 + T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells ( Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020 73. Rydyznski Moderbacher, C. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ∙ Dan, J.M. ... Antigen-specific adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Acute COVID-19 and Associations with Age and Disease Severity Cell. 2020; 183 :996-1012.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ). Activated CD16 + T cells show significant enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells compared with activated CD16 − T cells ( Figure 5 F). The remaining, non-responding activated CD16 + T cells may recognize other SARS-CoV-2 epitopes or may be driven by bystander activation and/or homeostatic proliferation ( Bergamaschi et al., 2021 6. Bergamaschi, L. ∙ Mescia, F. ∙ Turner, L. ... Longitudinal analysis reveals that delayed bystander CD8+ T cell activation and early immune pathology distinguish severe COVID-19 from mild disease Immunity. 2021; 54 :1257-1275.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mathew et al., 2020 58. Mathew, D. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ Baxter, A.E. ... Deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals distinct immunotypes with therapeutic implications Science. 2020; 369 , eabc8511 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This indicates that cognate T cell activation plays an important role in the generation of activated CD16 + T cells along with environmental signals in a complement split product-rich inflammatory milieu.
A very high proportion of T cells from acute COVID-19 and especially severe patients express cytotoxic molecules such as Perforin and Granzyme B ( Shuwa et al., 2021 83. Shuwa, H.A. ∙ Shaw, T.N. ∙ Knight, S.B. ... Alterations in T and B cell function persist in convalescent COVID-19 patients Med (N. Y.). 2021; 2 :720-735.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). The increased cytotoxic profile persisted for up to six months and was associated with poorer recovery. The CD16 + T cells identified in severe COVID-19 did not only express higher levels of PRF1 and GZMB but also LAMP1 and STX11 ( Figures 2 H and S2 B), which explains their increased general degranulation potential ( Figures 3 D and 3E; Spessott et al., 2017 85. Spessott, W.A. ∙ Sanmillan, M.L. ∙ Kulkarni, V.V. ... Syntaxin 4 mediates endosome recycling for lytic granule exocytosis in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes Traffic. 2017; 18 :442-452 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). So far, CD16 + T cells have been described mainly in patients with chronic infections or inflammation ( Björkström et al., 2008 7. Björkström, N.K. ∙ Gonzalez, V.D. ∙ Malmberg, K.-J. ... Elevated numbers of Fc gamma RIIIA+ (CD16+) effector CD8 T cells with NK cell-like function in chronic hepatitis C virus infection J.

FcγRIIIa (CD16) induction on human T lymphocytes and CD16pos T-lymphocyte amplification J. Immunother. 2011; 34 :542-549 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jacquemont et al., 2020 36. Jacquemont, L. ∙ Tilly, G. ∙ Yap, M. ... Terminally differentiated effector memory CD8+ T cells identify kidney transplant recipients at high risk of graft failure J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2020; 31 :876-891 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In these conditions, CD16 + T cells displayed a more differentiated phenotype like the one adopted during COVID-19 convalescence ( Figures 4 C, 4D and 4F). In acute COVID-19, we also identified elevated transcription of various granzyme genes including “Granzyme K” ( Figure S2 B). Interestingly, increased numbers of Granzyme K expressing effector memory T cells have been observed in blood samples of older individuals and these T cells were shown to augment cytokine and chemokine production by fibroblasts ( Mogilenko et al., 2021 62. Mogilenko, D.A. ∙ Shpynov, O. ∙ Andhey, P.S. ... Comprehensive profiling of an aging immune system reveals clonal GZMK+ CD8+ T cells as conserved hallmark of inflammaging Immunity. 2021; 54 :99-115.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was shown that extracellular Granzyme K proteolytically activates Protease-activated receptor-1 leading to increased release of IL-6 and CCL2 (MCP-1) by endothelial cells ( Sharma et al., 2016 82. Sharma, M. ∙ Merkulova, Y. ∙ Raithatha, S. ... Extracellular Granzyme K mediates endothelial activation through the cleavage of protease-activated receptor-1 FEBS J. 2016; 283 :1734-1747 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particularly in severe COVID-19, we demonstrated that T cells also induce CCL2 and XCL8 by co-cultured primary lung endothelial cells upon anti-CD16 mediated degranulation ( Figure 3 G). This establishes a general link between the immune complex triggering of local CD16 + T cells and endothelial cell-mediated release of monocyte and neutrophil chemoattractants, a hallmark of severe COVID-19 ( Rendeiro et al., 2021 72. Rendeiro, A.F. ∙ Ravichandran, H. ∙ Bram, Y. ... The spatial landscape of lung pathology during COVID-19 progression Nature. 2021; 593 :564-569 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Altogether, activated CD8 + T cells adopt antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) properties known for NK cells ( Lee et al., 2021 47. Lee, W.S. ∙ Selva, K.J. ∙ Davis, S.K. ... Decay of Fc-dependent antibody functions after mild to moderate COVID-19 Cell Rep. Med. 2021; 2 :100296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). ADCC can have protective but also disease exaggerating roles ( Yu et al., 2021 103. Yu, Y. ∙ Wang, M. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 2021; 6 :346 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The binding of antigen-antibody complexes to CD16 on activated T cells might, therefore, counteract anti-inflammatory immune complex clearing systems via complement receptor 1 ( Fernandez-Arias et al., 2013 21. Fernandez-Arias, C. ∙ Lopez, J.P. ∙ Hernandez-Perez, J.N. ... Malaria inhibits surface expression of complement receptor 1 in monocytes/macrophages, causing decreased immune complex internalization J. Immunol. 2013; 190 :3363-3372 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kavai, 2008 39. Kavai, M. Immune complex clearance by complement receptor type 1 in SLE Autoimmun. Rev. 2008; 8 :160-164 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, patients suffering from severe COVID-19 have been reported to display high levels of spike-reactive IgG with significantly reduced Fc fucosylation. This change in the Fc glycosylation increases binding affinity to CD16, leading to increased CD16-mediated effector function ( Ferrara et al., 2011 22. Ferrara, C. ∙ Grau, S. ∙ Jäger, C. ... Unique carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions are required for high affinity binding between FcgammaRIII and antibodies lacking core fucose Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :12669-12674 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hoepel et al., 2021 32. Hoepel, W. ∙ Chen, H.J. ∙ Geyer, C.E. ... High titers and low fucosylation of early human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG promote inflammation by alveolar macrophages Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13 , eabf8654 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vivier et al., 2008 95. Vivier, E. ∙ Tomasello, E. ∙ Baratin, M. ... Functions of natural killer cells Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :503-510 Crossref Scopus (2190) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, the distinct serological profile observed in severe COVID-19 with afucosylated, spike-directed IgG, and an inherently increased inflammatory capacity could further enhance the pathogenic potential of CD16 + T cells.
In a search for important environmental signals driving differentiation of activated CD16 + T cells, we detected a positive correlation between high serum C3a levels and proportions of CD16 + T cell clusters ( Figure 5 E). It has been reported that serum C3 hyperactivation is a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality ( Sinkovits et al., 2021 84. Sinkovits, G. ∙ Mező, B. ∙ Réti, M. ... Complement overactivation and consumption predicts in-hospital mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection Front. Immunol. 2021; 12 :663187 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) and widespread complement activation by all three pathways and, thus, generation of C3a has also been described in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Chouaki Benmansour et al., 2021 11. Chouaki Benmansour, N. ∙ Carvelli, J. ∙ Vivier, E. Complement cascade in severe forms of COVID-19: recent advances in therapy Eur. J.

Activation of classical and alternative complement pathways in the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 Clin. Immunol. 2021; 226 :108716 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). The disease-promoting activity of the complement system was observed for other coronaviruses, as SARS-CoV infection caused less systemic inflammatory response and lung injury in C3 knock-out as compared with wild-type mice ( Gralinski et al., 2018 26. Gralinski, L.E. ∙ Sheahan, T.P. ∙ Morrison, T.E. ... Complement activation contributes to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus pathogenesis mBio. 2018; 9 :e01753 e01718 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelial cells induces transcription of complement genes leading to the generation of activated C3a ( Yan et al., 2021 100. Yan, B. ∙ Freiwald, T. ∙ Chauss, D. ... SARS-CoV-2 drives JAK1/2-dependent local complement hyperactivation Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6 , eabg0833 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Signaling via complement receptors such as C3AR1 and cell-autonomous complosome in human T cells enhances induction of CD4 + Th1 responses and cytotoxic function of CD8 + T cells ( Arbore et al., 2018 4. Arbore, G. ∙ West, E.E. ∙ Rahman, J. ... Complement receptor CD46 co-stimulates optimal human CD8+ T cell effector function via fatty acid metabolism Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4186 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show that increased C3a generation in severe COVID-19 patients promotes differentiation of CD16 + , highly cytotoxic CD4 + and CD8 + T cells ( Figures 5 F–5H). Interestingly, targeting distal complement effects by receptor blockade in a humanized preclinical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevented acute lung injury ( Carvelli et al., 2020 10. Carvelli, J. ∙ Demaria, O. ∙ Vély, F. ... Association of COVID-19 inflammation with activation of the C5a-C5aR1 axis Nature. 2020; 588 :146-150 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Results from the first clinical trials on complement inhibition in COVID-19 also showed promising effects resulting in reduced inflammation and faster normalization of neutrophil and lymphocyte counts ( Mastaglio et al., 2020 56. Mastaglio, S. ∙ Ruggeri, A. ∙ Risitano, A.M. ... The first case of COVID-19 treated with the complement C3 inhibitor AMY-101 Clin.

Rationale for targeting complement in COVID-19 EMBO Mol. Med. 2020; 12 , e12642 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, C3 inhibition enabled a broader and better therapeutic potential as compared with C5 neutralization ( Mastellos et al., 2020 57. Mastellos, D.C. ∙ Pires da Silva, B.G.P. ∙ Fonseca, B.A.L. ... Complement C3 vs C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19: early clinical findings reveal differential biological efficacy Clin.

The limited number of convalescent samples did not allow us to perform correlations with patient recovery. Our major focus was to reveal immunopathogenic functions of severity-associated T cell populations during acute COVID-19 and to identify driving signals.
In this context, it would be of great interest to see whether application of the C3 inhibitor AMY-101 in COVID-19 patients with ARDS will ameliorate differentiation of CD16 + , cytotoxic T cells and, thus, endothelial cell injury and ultimately improved patient outcome.
It is very likely that the role of complement activation in COVID-19 goes beyond the here-described mechanisms, which should be investigated in future studies. Furthermore, although C3a neutralization significantly reduced the CD16 + differentiation potential of severe COVID-19 serum, we cannot exclude that other pro-inflammatory mechanisms could induce this activated CD16 + T cell phenotype. Certainly, here also a more detailed comparative investigation of T cell responses between COVID-19 and influenza infection on a larger and more stratified cohort is needed.
Also, It will be interesting to investigate whether the described inflammatory circuit is also active in other immune pathologies for which complement activation and immune complex formation have been described.
Taken together, particularly severe COVID-19 leads to an elevated number of activated CD16 + T cells that link triggering of the complement cascade via TCR-independent cytotoxic T cell functionality to endothelial damage and patient survival. This functionally links the innate and the adaptive immune system with endothelial injury, which might constitute an important molecular axis explaining the vast spectrum of organ damage observed in COVID-19.

Samples from patients with COVID-19 were collected within two cohort studies ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 77. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ... Severe COVID-19 is marked by a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment Cell. 2020; 182 :1419-1440.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ) designed to allow deep molecular and immunological studies of COVID-19 in blood. This study was primarily designed to describe immunological deviations in COVID-19 patients without the intention of the development of new treatments or new diagnostics, and, therefore, sample size estimation was not included in the original study design.
This study includes a subset of patients enrolled between March 2 and April 30 2021 in the Pa-COVID-19 study, a prospective observational cohort study assessing pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin ( Kurth et al., 2020 44. Kurth, F. ∙ Roennefarth, M. ∙ Thibeault, C. ... Studying the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019: a protocol for the Berlin prospective COVID-19 patient cohort (Pa-COVID-19) Infection. 2020; 48 :619-626 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The study was approved by the Institutional Review board of Charité (EA2/066/20). Written informed consent was provided by all patients or legal representatives for participation in the study. The patient population included in all analyses of cohort 1 consists of 43 control donors (samples collected in 2019 before SARS-CoV-2 outbreak or collected in the fall of 2020 who did not have a SARS-CoV-2 infection), 8 patients presenting with flu-like illness but tested SARS-CoV-2-negative, 6 patients with chronic HIV infection, 5 patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 35 mild and 42 severe COVID-19 patients during the acute or convalescent phase ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Table S1 ). Information on age, sex, medication, and comorbidities is listed in Table S1 . All COVID-19 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs and allocated to mild (WHO 2-4, mild+moderate) or severe (WHO 5-8, severe+critical) disease according to the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement
( https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/COVID-19_Treatment_Trial_Design_Master_Protocol_synopsis_Final_18022020.pdf ).
This study was approved by the Institutional Review board of the University Hospital Bonn (073/19 and 134/20). After providing written informed consent, 14 control donors and 22 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. In patients who were not able to consent at the time of study enrollment, consent was obtained after recovery. Information on age, sex, medication, and comorbidities are provided in Table S1 . COVID-19 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs were recruited at the Medical Clinic I of the University Hospital Bonn between March 30 and June 17, 2020 and allocated to mild (WHO 2-4, mild+moderate, n = 9) or severe (WHO 5-8, severe+critical, n = 13) disease according to the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement. Controls in cohort 2 were collected from healthy people or from otherwise hospitalized patients with a wide range of diseases and comorbidities including chronic inflammatory immune responses. These individuals were either tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, serologically negative or had no indication for acute COVID-19 disease based on clinical or laboratory parameters.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee (EK 304/20, EK 119/20, and EK 092/20). Informed consent for all autopsies was obtained from the legal representatives of the deceased patients. We consecutively included 14 autopsies of COVID-19-positive patients from April 2020 to January 2021. Each patient had a positive clinical PCR test for upper or lower respiratory SARS-CoV-2 before autopsy. Autopsies were performed in two steps according to a modified standard protocol to minimize staff exposure (developed as part of the German Registry for COVID-19 Autopsies – DeRegCOVID [ Boor et al., 2021 8. Boor, P. ∙ Eichhorn, P. ∙ Hartmann, A. ... Practical aspects of COVID-19 autopsies Pathologe. 2021; 42 :197-207 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ]). As a control, 18 lung tissues from three cohorts of non-COVID autopsies in an anonymized manner were included: four samples without inflammatory or fibrotic lung disease (“normal”) from 2009 to 2015, six samples from influenza patients from 2009 to 2018, and eight samples from 2010 to 2019 from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”) without acute inflammation of the selected ARDS samples (see Table S1 for cohort details).
All anti-human antibodies pre-conjugated to metal isotopes were obtained from Fluidigm Corporation (San Francisco, USA). All remaining antibodies were obtained from the indicated companies as purified antibodies and in-house conjugation was done using the MaxPar X8 labeling kit (Fluidigm, USA). Antibodies are listed in the key resources table.
Sample processing, cell staining and acquisition was done as previously described ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 77. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ... Severe COVID-19 is marked by a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment Cell. 2020; 182 :1419-1440.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). T cells were identified based on the expression of CD3 and CD45, but exclusion of CD19 + and CD15 + cells. Pregating on CD8 - TCRgd - , CD8 + TCRgd - and TCRgd + cells was used to define CD4 + , CD8 + and TCRgd + T cells, respectively ( Figure S4 D). As expected, samples from HIV patients showed an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio, whereas the proportions of all three main T cell compartments were similar between all other patient groups (mild and severe COVID-19, FLI, HBV) and controls (median levels: T helper cells 63.5-71.5%, CTLs 27.1-34.8%, TCRgd + 0.9-2.9%). Each T cell compartment was then clustered based on the expression of 30 markers: CD62L, CD45RO, CD28, CD27, CD226, ICOS, PD-1, LAG3, TIGIT, CD96, CD25, CD56, HLA-DR, CD38, CD137, CD69, Ki67, CXCR3, CXCR5, CCR6, CRTH2, KLRB1, KLRG1, KLRF1, CD95, CD10, CD16, CD34, CD123, and CD11cThe batch-normalized CyTOF values (described in Schulte-Schrepping et al., [2020] 77. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ... Severe COVID-19 is marked by a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment Cell. 2020; 182 :1419-1440.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ) were first transformed with the inverse hyperbolic sine function (asinh) and then z-score normalized per marker across all samples and all cells. We then clustered each T cell compartment excluding convalescent COVID-19 samples using Phenograph ( Levine et al., 2015 49. Levine, J.H. ∙ Simonds, E.F. ∙ Bendall, S.C. ... Data-driven phenotypic dissection of AML reveals progenitor-like cells that correlate with prognosis Cell. 2015; 162 :184-197 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (723) PubMed Google Scholar ) with 30 nearest neighbors (k = 30). We originally found 50 clusters, which were annotated based on the average z-score transformed CyTOF expression across T cells of the markers in each cluster. Four clusters were merged in pairs, as each pair slightly differed in the expression of only one marker (CD95) resulting in 48 clusters. Cells from the convalescent samples were classified into the clusters previously found, via k-nearest neighbor (in Euclidean distance) using the knn function from “class” R package. ( Figure S4 A). UMAPs were calculated across all acute and convalescent samples based on the 30 markers used for clustering, using the R package “uwot” (arXiv:1802.03426 ), n_neighbors = 30, spread = 1, min_dist = 0.5, based on Euclidean distance).
The frequency of each cluster was calculated as the percentage of cells in each cluster for each patient and for each T cell compartment. Statistical testing for the difference in the frequency of each cluster across severity groups was calculated with the adjusted Dunn's post-hoc test (Benjamini-Hochberg) for clusters with significant Kruskal-Wallis test (adjusted p-value (Benjamini-Hochberg) < 0.1, adjustment was done across all clusters in each T cell compartment). For the non-weekly analysis, we considered the first sample per patient when multiple samples were available. Similarly, for the weekly analysis, only the first sample per patient per week was included, and the repeated samples in the same week were excluded from the analysis.
To test whether the age of the patients in cohort 1 was confounding the abundance of the activated CD16 + T cell CyTOF clusters C8 and C26, we did a multivariate model for the frequencies of these clusters, with severity and age as predictors using the R function lm (stats package, version 4.0.3). In this analysis, we tested the cluster frequencies based on age and severity for healthy controls and acute COVID-19 patients selected for the non-weekly analysis ( Figures S1 C and S1D).
For the survival analysis ( Figure 6 A), we selected mild and severe COVID-19, samples acquired between 7 and 28 days post-symptom onset. In case of repeated measurements per patient, the first sample was selected. The proportions of T cells between severity groups were compared using the Wilcoxon test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. To define an objective way to select the sum of all activated CD16 + TCRab + clusters of our CyTOF dataset (cohort 1), we computed an activation value for each cluster in the TCRab + space, defined as the mean of the average z-scored expression of activation markers (CD25, HLA-DR, CD38, CD137, CD69, and Ki67). Then, clusters with an activation value higher than the average, and with an average z-scored CD16 expression higher than 1, were considered activated CD16 + TCRab + T cell clusters (CyTOF cluster 8, 13, 26).
Whole blood was prepared by treatment of 1ml peripheral blood with 10ml of RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend, USA). After one wash in DPBS, cells were directly processed for scRNA-seq (BD Rhapsody) or multi-color flow cytometry (MCFC). After RBC lysis, cells were washed with DPBS and from each sample 1-2 million cells were stained for flow cytometric analysis ( Table S3 ). Antibody staining was performed in DPBS with the addition of BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer (Becton Dickinson, USA) for 30min at 4°C as described before ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 77. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ... Severe COVID-19 is marked by a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment Cell. 2020; 182 :1419-1440.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). To remove dead cells from the analysis, a staining for dead cells was included (LIVE/DEAD Fixable Yellow Dead Cell Stain Kit; 1:1000 – Thermo Scientific, USA). To prevent any possible contamination of the operator, after staining, the samples were fixed for 5 minutes with 4% PFA. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a BD Symphony instrument (Becton Dickinson, USA) configured with 5 lasers (UV, violet, blue, yellow-green, red). Flow cytometry data analysis was performed with FlowJo V10.7.1, CD16/HLA-DR double-positive cells were gated from the total T lymphocytes (living/CD45 + /CD66b - /CD19 - /CD3 + ), STAR Methods , data and code availability reports the detailed gating strategy and representative plots. With this analysis we confirmed the existence of a CD3 + CD16 + HLA-DR + T cell population.
We used our flow cytometry datasets (fcs files) described previously ( Kverneland et al., 2016 45. Kverneland, A.H. ∙ Streitz, M. ∙ Geissler, E. ... Age and gender leucocytes variances and references values generated using the standardized one-study protocol Cytometry A. 2016; 89 :543-564 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) to report the proportions of CD16 expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Briefly, whole blood samples collected from healthy controls spanning an age range between 20 and 84 years with equal distribution of females and males in each 10-year age bin were stained using the ONE Study antibody panels as previously described ( Sawitzki et al., 2020 75. Sawitzki, B. ∙ Harden, P.N. ∙ Reinke, P. ... Regulatory cell therapy in kidney transplantation (The ONE Study): a harmonised design and analysis of seven non-randomised, single-arm, phase 1/2A trials Lancet. 2020; 395 :1627-1639 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ; Streitz et al., 2013 87. Streitz, M. ∙ Miloud, T. ∙ Kapinsky, M. ... Standardization of whole blood immune phenotype monitoring for clinical trials: panels and methods from the ONE study Transplant. Res. 2013; 2 :17 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and acquired on a 10-Color Navios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). For the here reported results data from panel 1 were used. The flow cytometry data analysis was performed in Kaluza version 1.2 (Beckman Coulter, USA, Figure S5 A, gating strategy and representative plots).
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized whole blood by density gradient centrifugation over Pancoll (density: 1,077g /ml, PAN-Biotech, Germany). Subsequently, the cells were counted, frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.
On the day of the experiment, the frozen PBMCs were thawed in pre-warmed thawing medium (RPMI 1640, Gibco; 2% FCS, Sigma; 0,01% Pierce Universal Nuclease, Thermo Fisher, USA).
Approximately 2-3 x10 5 PBMCs were resuspended in staining buffer (DPBS, Gibco; 0,5% BSA, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany; 2 mM EDTA, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and hashtagged with 0.5 μg Total-Seq-C™ Hashtag antibodies for 30 min at 4°C. After the incubation, PBMCs were washed three times. Subsequently, PBMC were counted and up to four different samples were pooled equally. The PBMCs were washed three times, resuspended in DPBS, filtered through a 40 μm mesh (Flowmi™ Cell Strainer, Merck, Germany) and counted using the C-Chip hemocytometer (NanoEntek, South Korea). The cell suspension was super-loaded with 40000 - 50,000 cells per lane, in the Chromium™ Controller for partitioning single-cells into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-Emulsions (GEMs).
The remaining PBMCs were subjected to flow-cytometric sorting based on DAPI, CD3 (clone UCHT1), CD4 (clone RPA-T4), CD8 (RPA-T8) and CD38 (clone HB7) antibody staining and simultaneously hashtagged as described above. We did not include CD45RA or CD45RO as we did not want to exclude activated naive T cells from our analysis. Live (DAPI-) CD3 + CD4 + CD38 + , as well as CD3 + CD8 + CD38 + cells, were sorted using the FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences, USA). Afterwards, CD4 + CD38 + and CD8 + CD38 + T cells from each donor were pooled equally and CD38 + T cells from up to four samples were pooled to equal proportions. The resulting cell pool was resuspended in DPBS, filtered through a 40 μm mesh (Flowmi™ Cell Strainer, Merck, Germany) and counted using the C-Chip hemocytometer (NanoEntek, South Korea). The cell suspension was super-loaded with 40,000 - 50,000 cells per lane, in the Chromium™ Controller for partitioning single-cells into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-Emulsions (GEMs).
The Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Kit v1.1 was used for reverse transcription, cDNA amplification and library construction of the gene expression libraries (10x Genomics, USA). For additional VDJ and hashtag libraries the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cell (10x Genomics, USA) and the Chromium Single Cell 5’ Feature Barcode Library Kit (10x Genomics, USA) were used, respectively. All libraries were prepared following the detailed protocols provided by 10x Genomics, quantified by Qubit Flex Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, USA) and quality was checked using 2100 Bioanalyzer with High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent, USA). Sequencing was performed in paired-end mode with a S1 and S2 flow cell using NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA).
For the analysis of the T lymphocytes compartment of COVID-19 patients, the PBMC dataset from Schulte-Schrepping et al. ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 77. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ... Severe COVID-19 is marked by a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment Cell. 2020; 182 :1419-1440.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used. The dataset was provided as a Seurat object of the PBMCs samples from the original study including all pre-processing and filtering criteria as described in the original manuscript. The data can be downloaded from FASTGenomics [ FASTGenomics: https://beta.fastgenomics.org/p/schulte-schrepping_covid19 ] or directly explored using the web platform.
The Cell Ranger Software Suite (Version 5.0.0) was used to process raw sequencing data, using the cellranger multi workflow and the GRCh38 references for gene expression and VDJ data and totalSeq antibody barcode sequences for feature barcoding data. Multiplexed samples from multiple donors were demultiplexed by detecting SNPs using CellSNP-lite ( Huang and Huang, 2021 34. Huang, X. ∙ Huang, Y. Cellsnp-lite: an efficient tool for genotyping single cells Bioinformatics. 2021; 37 :4569-4571 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For each sample, the number of RNA counts per cell was mean-normalized, and cells with a mean-normalized RNA count lower than 0.45 and higher than 5 were excluded from the analysis, as well as cells with a percentage of mitochondrial reads higher than 10%. The filtered data were then log-normalized and scaled using the Seurat package.
After filtering, gene expression data from PBMCs and enriched CD38 + T cells were log-normalized, merged, and scaled. We merged different libraries using the FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions of Seurat with reduction.use='rpca'. We then performed PCA based on a subset of genes that exhibited high cell-to-cell variation (FindVariableFeatures Seurat function), constructed a KNN graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space considering the first 15 PCs (FindNeighbors Seurat function), and clustered the cells with the Louvain algorithm implemented in FindClusters Seurat function, with a resolution of 0.5.
Clusters from merged CD38 + T cell and PBMC libraries that contained mainly cells from PBMC libraries were excluded from the T cell space. T cell clusters were then confirmed by their high expression of CD3D , CD3E , and CD3G genes. At least 80% of the cells in the selected T cell clusters had a V(D)J sequence, whereas excluded clusters had a maximum of 10% of cells with a V(D)J sequence.
After selecting T cells from PBMCs and enriched CD38 + T cells, we performed PCA based on a subset of genes that exhibited high cell-to-cell variation (FindVariableFeatures Seurat function). We then constructed a KNN graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space considering the first 15 PCs (FindNeighbors Seurat function) and clustered the cells with the Louvain algorithm implemented in FindClusters Seurat function, with a resolution of 0.5. UMAP was computed with the first 15 PCs.
To align the CyTOF and scRNA-seq T cell clusters, we applied a feature-based cluster annotation approach. The selected feature list contained genes for all markers analyzed in CyTOF measurements plus additional genes such as T cell state-specific transcription markers (data and code availability). The specific name was assigned according to the Z-score standardized gene expression level of a particular set of genes (e.g., MKI67 ++ / FCGR3A ++ ) or well-established cellular states (e.g. CD4 naive). To annotate the clusters, we generated a heatmap ( Figure 2 B) to visualize the expression of selected genes that were also selected as variable features (in the previous step). We found 20 clusters, and some of them displayed nearly identical phenotypes and, thus, were merged, ending up with 17 clusters ( Figures 2 A and 2B). T cell clusters were composed of i) solely CD4 expressing T cell clusters (clusters 1 to 7), ii) clusters of CD4 , CD8A / B & TRGC2 expressing T cells (clusters 8 & 9), iii) clusters containing CD8A / B & TRGC2 expressing T cells (clusters 10 to 13 and 16) and iv) clusters of solely CD8 transcribing T cells (clusters 14 & 15). Cluster 8-10 were characterized by highly activated T cells with high transcription of CD38 and HLA-DR genes ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Cluster 7 showed the typical features of activated TFH cells, as in addition to CD38 and HLA-DR genes, they transcribed ICOS , CD40LG , PDCD1 (PD-1) and CXCR5 ( Figure 2 B). Cluster 8 T cells transcribed the highest MKI67 (Ki67) levels, indicative of the highest proliferative potential ( Figures 2 B and 2C). In addition, they expressed FCGR3A (CD16A), which was even more pronounced for cluster 10 T cells ( Figures 2 B and 2C).
The complete processing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering were performed with the Seurat package.
The frequency of each cluster was calculated as the percentage of cells in each cluster for each patient. Statistical testing for the difference in the frequency of each cluster was calculated with adjusted Dunn's post-hoc test (Benjamini-Hochberg) for clusters with significant Kruskal-Wallis test (adjusted p-value (Benjamini-Hochberg) < 0.05, depicted as KW ∗ in e.g.: Figures 2 E and S2 A).
For the identification of differentially expressed genes between disease groups, we used pseudobulk gene expression, i.e., the sum of the raw counts from all cells in each patient among selected clusters of interest. The pseudobulk samples were then normalized according to the DESeq2 pipeline (( Love et al., 2014 51. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (22849) PubMed Google Scholar ), v. 1.30.0). For further enrichment analysis, we selected differentially expressed genes with high counts (“baseMean” > 100) and p-value lower than 0.05. Differentially expressed genes were identified with the R package “DESeq2” v. 1.30.1 and GO enrichment analysis was performed with the R package “enrichR” v. 3.0.
The log 2 -fold change of differentially expressed genes (with high counts, i.e., “baseMean” > 100) from DESeq2 was used to define the ranked gene list used for GSEA. We tested three signatures (listed in Table S2 ): (1) RESPONSE TO TYPE I INTERFERON (GO:0034340), DEFENSE RESPONSE TO VIRUS (GO:0051607), and cytotoxicity. Gene lists (1) and (2) were obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 89. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (21618) PubMed Google Scholar ), and for the cytotoxicity signature we used 17 cytotoxicity-associated genes taken from T_CELL_MEDIATED_CYTOTOXICITY (GO:0001913) and ( Zhang et al., 2020 105. Zhang, J.-Y. ∙ Wang, X.-M. ∙ Xing, X. ... Single-cell landscape of immunological responses in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1107-1118 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). GSEA was performed with the R package “fgsea” v. 1.16.0 with 1000 permutations for statistical testing.
From the complete landscape of immune cells in the PBMCs dataset, according to the labels of the original manuscript ( Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020 77. Schulte-Schrepping, J. ∙ Reusch, N. ∙ Paclik, D. ... Severe COVID-19 is marked by a dysregulated myeloid cell compartment Cell. 2020; 182 :1419-1440.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, Activated T cells, Prol. cells and NK cells were selected for downstream analysis. The subset was scaled, centered, and regressed against the number of detected transcripts per cell. PCA was calculated on the top 2000 most variable genes using the vst method integrated into Seurat’s FindVariableFeatures function and UMAP dimensionality reduction was performed. In the newly defined cellular space, we identified unwanted cells (non-T cells) according to the expression of lineage markers. With this approach, we removed NK cells and a small proportion of monocytes found to contaminate the original lymphocytes cluster. We further optimized the selection of the T cells space by removing cells that overlap with a recent study on NK cells, which utilizes the same dataset ( Krämer et al., 2021 42. Krämer, B. ∙ Knoll, R. ∙ Bonaguro, L. ... Early IFN-α signatures and persistent dysfunction are distinguishing features of NK cells in severe COVID-19 Immunity. 2021; 54 :2650-2669.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cleaned T cell space was once more scaled and PCA, as well as UMAP dimensionality reduction, were computed as described above. Cell clusters were calculated on the first 20 principal components (PCs) using Louvain clustering with a resolution of 1. All analysis steps were performed with Seurat [( Hao et al., 2021 30. Hao, Y. ∙ Hao, S. ∙ Andersen-Nissen, E. ... Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data Cell. 2021; 184 :3573-3587.e29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ), v. 3.9.9.9032].
The 19 cell clusters were manually annotated according to a set of T cell hallmark genes ( Figures 2 B and S3 B). Cell cluster names were assigned according to the expression levels of particular sets of genes (e.g., MKI67 + + / FCGR3A + + ) or well-established cellular states (e.g., CD4 naive)
For the analysis of the differential regulation of specific pathways in moderate or severe COVID-19, GSEA was performed on pseudobulk samples. In this analysis, we included only samples from weeks 1 and 2 post-symptom onset. A pseudobulk sample, defined as the sum of the raw counts from all cells in each group, was generated for moderate and severe patients. The pseudobulk samples were then normalized according to the DEseq2 pipeline (( Love et al., 2014 51. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (22849) PubMed Google Scholar ), v. 1.30.0). Log 2 -transformed fold change of each gene was calculated to define the ranked gene list used for GSEA. GSEA was performed with the fgsea package with 1000 permutations for statistical testing.
All the graphical visualization of the data was performed in R with the ggplot2 package with the exception of the heatmaps, which were displayed using the pheatmap library
Box plots:
Box plots are calculated in the style of Tukey, shortly the center of the box represents the median of the values, the hinges the 25th and 75th percentile and the whiskers are extended no further than the 1.5 ∗ IQR (interquartile range). When multiple samples from the same donors were present in the same group only the earliest sample was used for visualization and statistical testing.
Heatmap:
The heatmap shows the mean value of the scaled expression of each gene in each cluster.
Dot plot:
The dot plot of the signature genes shown in Figure S3 F was calculated according to the Dotplot Seurat function scaling the expression values by gene.
To calculate the statistical significance of the changes observed in the frequency of selected T cell clusters we first performed a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing when more than one test was performed. For the clusters showing statistically significant results, we performed a pairwise Dunn post-hoc test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. An adjusted p-value < 0.05 was considered significant and annotated above the box plot as follow: < 0.05 ∗ , < 0.01 ∗∗ , < 0.001 ∗∗∗ .
COVID-19 autopsy lung tissue samples were screened for the presence of morphological criteria consistent with diffuse alveolar damage and best tissue preservation. Three samples of each case were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with RT-PCR as previously reported ( von Stillfried et al., 2021 96. von Stillfried, S. ∙ Villwock, S. ∙ Bülow, R.D. ...

Wong, D.W.L. ∙ Klinkhammer, B.M. ∙ Djudjaj, S. ... Multisystemic cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in autopsies of COVID-19 patients Cells. 2021; 10 :1900 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Briefly, using a Maxwell® 16 LEV RNA FFPE Purification Kit (Promega GmbH, Walldorf, Germany), we extracted RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissue blocks on the Maxwell® 16 IVD instrument (Promega GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA eluates were processed immediately or stored at -80°C for further processing. We used the TaqMan™ Fast 1-Step Master Mix for the qualitative detection of the E gene and the RdRp gene as a second target with primer and probe sets labeled with fluorescent reporters and quencher dyes. Internal Positive Control reagents were used as internal PCR controls. RT-PCR was performed according to a previous publication ( Remmelink et al., 2020 71. Remmelink, M. ∙ De Mendonça, R. ∙ D’Haene, N. ... Unspecific post-mortem findings despite multiorgan viral spread in COVID-19 patients Crit. Care. 2020; 24 :495 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). The primer and probe sequences used are listed in the key resources table. Results were analyzed using BioRad CFX Maestro software. The E gene was used to screen for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and validated with the detection of the RdRp gene as a second target. Samples with RT-PCR Ct (cycle threshold) values >40 for E and RdRp genes were considered negative. Samples were interpreted particularly as positive if Ct values for the E gene only were ≤40, and if additionally, the Ct value for the RdRp gene was ≤40. Finally, the sample from each case with the lowest Ct value for SARS-CoV-2 E gene RNA (indicating the highest RNA quantity) was selected for immunofluorescent staining.
FFPE blocks of the samples with the lowest Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 E gene RNA were cut to 1 μm thin sections, deparaffinized, rehydrated and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To analyze lymphocyte subtypes, we stained tissue sections using our pre-established protocol as follows: slides underwent antigen retrieval in low pH (citrate) buffer using the PT-Link module (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA). After fixation in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, slides were washed, and blocking was performed with peroxidase blocking solution followed by 30 min incubation with antibody diluent. Immunofluorescence multiplex staining was performed with the Opal 7-Color Manual IHC Kit. The slides were incubated for 1h with primary antibodies CD3 (clone CD3-12, Bio Rad) and CD16 (clone DJ130c, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as well as CD31 (clone JC70A, Agilent Technologies), followed by incubation with EnVision FLEX HRP and visualized with Opal 520 TSA Plus (Akoya Biosciences), Opal 690 (Akoya Biosciences) and Opal 620 TSA Plus (Akoya Biosciences), respectively. The nuclei were counterstained using Spectral DAPI.
We scanned immunofluorescence slides using the VECTRA automated quantitative pathology imaging system (Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, USA) and generated ten multispectral images per slide (each multispectral image had the size 334μm ∗ 250μm). After deploying automated cell detection using the InForm software, we trained an in-built cell phenotyping algorithm to detect CD3+/CD16+ cells in our cohorts. From each cohort, multispectral images of one patient were used for training and manually annotated using the above-mentioned phenotype. This algorithm was then deployed on all samples to detect the above-mentioned phenotypes. Measurement outputs of the inForm-Software were analyzed using the phenoptr and phenoptrReports packages in R version 4.0.3. Our final readout was the number of CD3/CD16 double-positive cells per mm 2 within each cohort. Representative immunofluorescence pictures were obtained with a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 microscope using 40x objective and image analysis software ZEN 3.0 black edition.
To calculate the statistical significance of changes observed in CD3/CD16 double-positive cells we performed a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test for all columns. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant and annotated above the column as follow: <0.05 ∗ , <0.01 ∗∗ , <0.001 ∗∗∗ .
Detection of IgG and IgA to the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein were assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG ELISAs (Euroimmun AG, Germany), as described elsewhere ( Schlickeiser et al., 2020 76. Schlickeiser, S. ∙ Schwarz, T. ∙ Steiner, S. ... Disease severity, fever, age, and sex correlate With SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :628971 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Serum samples were tested at a 1:101 dilution and optical density (OD) ratios were calculated by dividing the OD at 450 nm by the OD of a calibrator sample tested within each run. Therefore, the calculated OD ratios can be used as a relative measure for the concentration of IgA and IgG antibodies in the tested sample. For IgG and IgA, OD ratios above 1.1 were considered to be reactive. Statistical analysis and data visualization was done in Prism9.
Frozen PBMC were thawed using Benzonase-containing wash buffer (RPMI, 2% FCS, Pierce Universal Nuclease, 250U/mL) seeded at 0.25x10 6 /well and rested overnight in a humidified incubator.
