Title: RNA-Induced Conformational Switching and Clustering of G3BP Drive Stress Granule Assembly by Condensation


Abstract: Summary

Stressed cells shut down translation, release mRNA molecules from polysomes, and form stress granules (SGs) via a network of interactions that involve G3BP. Here we focus on the mechanistic underpinnings of SG assembly. We show that, under non-stress conditions, G3BP adopts a compact auto-inhibited state stabilized by electrostatic intramolecular interactions between the intrinsically disordered acidic tracts and the positively charged arginine-rich region. Upon release from polysomes, unfolded mRNAs outcompete G3BP auto-inhibitory interactions, engendering a conformational transition that facilitates clustering of G3BP through protein-RNA interactions. Subsequent physical crosslinking of G3BP clusters drives RNA molecules into networked RNA/protein condensates. We show that G3BP condensates impede RNA entanglement and recruit additional client proteins that promote SG maturation or induce a liquid-to-solid transition that may underlie disease. We propose that condensation coupled to conformational rearrangements and heterotypic multivalent interactions may be a general principle underlying RNP granule assembly.

Section: Introduction

Assembly of membraneless compartments by phase separation is emerging as a principle of organizing the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of cells ( Banani et al., 2017; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 9. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Crossref Scopus (834) PubMed Google Scholar 100. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (559) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phase separation is a cooperative process by which a homogeneous solution of components separates into two or more coexisting phases: a dilute phase and a dense phase rich in macromolecules (or biomolecular condensate). These condensates can serve as selective membraneless compartments that regulate biochemical reactions ( Alberti et al., 2019; Banani et al., 2017 6. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T.

Growing evidence points to intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) as regulators of condensates ( Alberti et al., 2019; Posey et al., 2018 6. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T. Considerations and Challenges in Studying Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Biomolecular Condensates Cell. 2019; 176 :419-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar 91. Posey, A.E. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Pappu, R.V. Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Methods Enzymol. 2018; 611 :1-30 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). IDRs have a wide variety of physical properties ( Das et al., 2015; Franzmann and Alberti, 2019a, 2019b 22. Das, R.K. ∙ Ruff, K.M. ∙ Pappu, R.V.

Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, different IDRs may play different roles as drivers or inhibitors of phase separation. One view is that IDRs drive assembly through multiple weakly interacting motifs or stickers that are separated by flexible spacer regions ( Harmon et al., 2017b; Wang et al., 2018 38.

Another view is that IDRs undergo sequence-specific, reversible, amyloid-like interactions ( Kato et al., 2012; Kato and McKnight, 2018 48. Kato, M. ∙ McKnight, S.L. A Solid-State Conceptualization of Information Transfer from Gene to Message to Protein Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87 :351-390 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar 50.

Much work remains to understand how IDRs regulate condensate assembly in cells. Of importance is the question of how IDRs contribute to the specificity and selectivity required for condensate assembly in the crowded cell environment.
Stress granules (SGs) are inducible condensates that enrich messenger RNA (mRNA), RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and small ribosomal subunits in the cytoplasm of stressed eukaryotic cells. SG assembly is triggered by, e.g. oxidative stress, heat shock, or osmotic stress ( Aulas et al., 2017; Khong et al., 2017; Namkoong et al., 2018; Panas et al., 2016; Protter and Parker, 2016 8.

Inhibition of ribosome recruitment induces stress granule formation independently of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation Mol. Biol.

SGs have been proposed to be sites of translation repression or stabilization of mRNAs and to have a pro-survival function during stress ( Kedersha et al., 2002; Kimball et al., 2003; Panas et al., 2016; Protter and Parker, 2016 52.

Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Parker, R. Principles and Properties of Stress Granules Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 :668-679 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ). SGs have also been related to human disease ( Alberti and Carra, 2018; Taylor et al., 2016 3. Alberti, S. ∙ Carra, S. Quality Control of Membraneless Organelles J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4711-4729 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar 105. Taylor, J.P. ∙ Brown, Jr., R.H. ∙ Cleveland, D.W. Decoding ALS: from genes to mechanism Nature. 2016; 539 :197-206 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ). The molecular mechanisms underlying SG assembly and disease-related changes remain unclear, and mutually inconsistent models have been proposed.
One proposal is that SGs assemble by phase separation ( Kroschwald et al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015 61. Kroschwald, S. ∙ Maharana, S. ∙ Mateju, D. ...

A Liquid-to-Solid Phase Transition of the ALS Protein FUS Accelerated by Disease Mutation Cell. 2015; 162 :1066-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (729) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several IDR-containing proteins that localize to SGs, such as FUS and hnRNPA1, have been shown to undergo phase separation in vitro ( Molliex et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015 82. Molliex, A. ∙ Temirov, J. ∙ Lee, J. ... Phase separation by low complexity domains promotes stress granule assembly and drives pathological fibrillization Cell. 2015; 163 :123-133 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar 89.

A Liquid-to-Solid Phase Transition of the ALS Protein FUS Accelerated by Disease Mutation Cell. 2015; 162 :1066-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (729) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, FUS and hnRNPA1 are genetically dispensable for SG assembly. Hence, the phase separation model of SG assembly has been challenged ( Wheeler et al., 2016 117. Wheeler, J.R. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... Distinct stages in stress granule assembly and disassembly eLife. 2016; 5 Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar ). One study proposed that SG assembly involves formation of solid core particles that recruit additional RBPs and RNAs ( Jain et al., 2016 47. Jain, S. ∙ Wheeler, J.R. ∙ Walters, R.W. ... ATPase-Modulated Stress Granules Contain a Diverse Proteome and Substructure Cell. 2016; 164 :487-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). This model was recently modified by the suggestion that intermolecular base-pairing among RNA molecules drives their aggregation into ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules ( Jain and Vale, 2017; Van Treeck et al., 2018; Van Treeck and Parker, 2018 46.

USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another model proposed that SG assembly requires a solid-like seed composed of the SG protein G3BP1 and the small ribosomal subunit 40S ( Kedersha et al., 2016; Panas et al., 2016 53. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J.

Cell Biol. 2016; 215 :313-323 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although all of these models converge on the idea that SG assembly is driven by a combination of homotypic and heterotypic interactions involving IDRs ( Fang et al., 2019; Kato and McKnight, 2018; Lin et al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015; Protter et al., 2018 27.

Testing the various ideas requires a defined system in which SG assembly can be followed step by step.
Here we use reconstitution approaches and cell experiments to demonstrate that SGs form by RNA-mediated condensation of the RBPs G3BP1 and G3BP2. We show that G3BP1 adopts an autoinhibitory compact state under non-stress conditions that is stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged RG-rich region and a disordered acidic region. RNA binding outcompetes this autoinhibitory interaction to liberate the RG-rich region and promote cooperative protein-RNA interactions. This results in assembly of G3BP1 clusters that physically crosslink RNA molecules to form inhomogeneous G3BP1-RNA condensates of low protein density. In summary, we propose a molecular mechanism for how complex assemblies such as SGs emerge through regulated density transitions that involve combinations of conformational rearrangements and heterotypic multivalent interactions, leading to hierarchical assembly.

G3BP1 and its homolog G3BP2 (collectively referred to as G3BP) are required for SG assembly under a variety of stress conditions, as opposed to other SG components whose deletion only affects the size or the number of SGs ( Kedersha et al., 2016; Matsuki et al., 2013 53.

To gain insight into SG assembly, we employed lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) ( Chen et al., 2014 18. Chen, B.-C. ∙ Legant, W.R. ∙ Wang, K. ... Lattice light-sheet microscopy: imaging molecules to embryos at high spatiotemporal resolution Science. 2014; 346 :1257998 Crossref Scopus (770) PubMed Google Scholar ) to film HeLa cells expressing G3BP1-mCherry from a bacterial artificial chromosome. G3BP1 was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm during growth and assembled into SGs upon oxidative stress ( Figure S1 A). Although G3BP1 structures were observed by conventional microscopy ∼20 min after stress ( Figure S1 A; Video S1 ), with LLSM small G3BP1 structures were detected within ∼5 min of treatment ( Figures 1 A and S1 A; Video S2 ).

Analysis of G3BP1 foci over time in individual cells revealed an early apparent growth phase in which the number, size, and intensity of foci increased (∼5 to ∼10 min) and a late phase (starting ∼10 min after stress) in which the foci remained relatively stable ( Figure 1 B). Early and late G3BP1 foci coalesced with one another and underwent shape changes ( Figures 1 A, S1 B, and S1 C; Video S2 ). G3BP1 molecules within the same SG rapidly rearranged (determined by partial fluorescence recovery after photobleaching [FRAP]) ( Figures S1 D–S1E) and exchanged with the cytoplasm and neighboring SGs (determined by full FRAP, data not shown).
The onset of visible G3BP1 foci in individual cells was heterogeneous and marginally dependent on G3BP1 expression levels, whereas the overall number of early SGs correlated with expression of G3BP1 ( Figure 1 C). This behavior suggests that the onset of SG assembly is determined by an upstream process, such as release of mRNA from polysomes ( Bounedjah et al., 2014 12. Bounedjah, O. ∙ Desforges, B. ∙ Wu, T.-D. ... Free mRNA in excess upon polysome dissociation is a scaffold for protein multimerization to form stress granules Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :8678-8691 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine the importance of RNA for SG assembly, we permeabilized stressed cells in the presence of RNase A, which led to SG dissolution ( Figure S1 F).
Taken together, our data suggest that G3BP1-mediated SGs assemble by heterotypic phase separation of G3BP1 and RNA, as opposed to a mechanism driven exclusively by interactions among G3BP molecules.
G3BP1 is a multi-domain RBP with two folded domains, an N-terminal nuclear transport factor-like domain (NTF2), and an RNA recognition motif (RRM) close to its C terminus. These domains are connected by IDRs enriched in net-negative (acidic) and proline residues (PxxP). In addition, G3BP1 has an arginine- and glycine-rich C-terminal IDR (RG) ( Figures 2 A and 4 A). We purified GFP-G3BP1 (hereafter referred to as G3BP1) from insect cells. We diluted the purified protein, from 0.1 to 10 μM (the cellular concentration of G3BP1 is 624 nM; Hein et al., 2015 40. Hein, M.Y. ∙ Hubner, N.C. ∙ Poser, I. ... A human interactome in three quantitative dimensions organized by stoichiometries and abundances Cell. 2015; 163 :712-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ), into a physiological buffer and observed the protein solution by fluorescence microscopy. G3BP1 was diffusely distributed ( Figures 2 B and S2 A). However, condensates assembled in the presence of total RNA from HeLa cells and 1% polyethylene glycol (PEG) ( Figure 2 B). Assembly of G3BP1-RNA condensates was dependent on protein and RNA concentration and sensitive to changes in salt concentration ( Figures 2 B and S2 B). Raising the salt concentration caused condensate dissolution ( Figure S2 C), demonstrating reversibility. G3BP1 molecules within G3BP1-RNA condensates rearranged rapidly ( Figure 2 C) and, upon encounter, two condensates fused with one another ( Figure 2 D), demonstrating that protein and RNA can reorganize within condensates. Together, these results recapitulate the SG dynamics observed in cells ( Figures 1 A and S1 D) and support a model of heterotypic interactions among G3BP1 and RNA molecules driving SG assembly.

The RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease G3BP assembles stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160 :823-831 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, the RG-rich region is required for G3BP1 assembly upon stress ( Bley et al., 2015; Tourrière et al., 2003 10. Bley, N. ∙ Lederer, M. ∙ Pfalz, B. ... Stress granules are dispensable for mRNA stabilization during cellular stress Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e26 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar 107.

To test the roles of the NTF2 and the RG-rich region in phase separation, we purified GFP-G3BP1(ΔNTF) and GFP-G3BP1(ΔRG) ( Figure S2 A). Using a set of biophysical methods, we determined that G3BP1(ΔNTF) is monomeric, even at high micromolar concentrations, whereas G3BP1(wild-type [WT]) and G3BP1(ΔRG) formed stable dimers, even at nanomolar concentrations ( Table S1 ). Unlike G3BP1(WT), G3BP1(ΔNTF) and G3BP1(ΔRG) did not assemble into condensates in the presence of RNA and 1% PEG ( Figures 2 E and S2 D). This indicates that the RG-rich region is indispensable for assembly and that dimerization per se is insufficient but necessary for RNA-mediated condensate assembly in vitro .
Excess of RNA did not induce condensate dissolution ( Figure 2 B), indicating that G3BP1-RNA condensates may be stabilized by protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions. To test for protein-protein interactions, we induced G3BP1 phase separation in the absence of RNA by increasing PEG concentration. RNA-independent phase separation of G3BP1(WT) occurred at PEG concentrations of 4% or higher ( Figure S2 E). No phase separation was observed for G3BP1(ΔNTF), demonstrating that G3BP1 dimerization is also critical for RNA-independent assembly, presumably by doubling the valence of motifs that drive phase separation. In contrast to the WT, G3BP1(ΔRG) assembled at higher PEG concentrations (≥6%) ( Figure S2 E). These data indicate that the RG-rich region contributes relevant motifs involved in high-order protein-protein interactions that stabilize multivalent interactions necessary for RNA-dependent phase separation of G3BP1 dimers.
To test whether reconstituted G3BP1-RNA condensates recruit other RBPs known to localize to SGs, we combined Alexa 546-labeled SNAP-G3BP1(WT) condensates with various purified GFP-tagged proteins. The concentration of the client proteins was kept below their saturation concentration ( Figure S2 H). Many SG clients partitioned into pre-formed G3BP1-RNA condensates, but GFP and the paraspeckle proteins PSPC and SFPQ did not enrich ( Figures 2 F and S2 H). Partitioning of some RBPs into G3BP1-RNA condensates depended on the RNA type (total HeLa RNA versus poly(A) RNA) (data not shown), suggesting that client recruitment is at least partially determined by the RNA binding preference of the client. G3BP1 did not partition into pre-formed FUS condensates in the absence of RNA ( Figure S2 I), demonstrating that G3BP1 and FUS do not readily interact. This suggests that FUS recruitment to G3BP1-RNA condensates is a consequence of FUS binding to RNA. In the context of the stress response, our data suggest that G3BP1-RNA condensates act as a scaffold to which other RBPs are recruited.

Purified mCherry-Caprin-1 did not phase separate in the presence of RNA ( Figures S2 A and S2F) even though it contains RGG repeats ( Solomon et al., 2007 101. Solomon, S. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Wang, B. ... Distinct structural features of caprin-1 mediate its interaction with G3BP-1 and its induction of phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha, entry to cytoplasmic stress granules, and selective interaction with a subset of mRNAs Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27 :2324-2342 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Caprin-1 weakly enriched in pre-formed G3BP1-RNA condensates ( Figure S2 F) and reduced the threshold for RNA-driven phase separation ( Figure 2 G). The decreased saturation concentration of G3BP1 may be explained by Caprin-1 increasing the RNA-binding affinity of G3BP1 ( Figure S2 G) (for technical details, refer to G3BP1 Condensates Inhibit RNA Entanglement ). We propose that Caprin-1 potentiates SG assembly by a process known as polyphasic linkage ( Wyman and Gill, 1980 119. Wyman, J. ∙ Gill, S.J. Ligand-linked phase changes in a biological system: applications to sickle cell hemoglobin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1980; 77 :5239-5242 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), where the preference of the ligand Caprin-1 for partitioning into G3BP1-RNA condensates reduces the saturation concentration of G3BP1.
Accumulation of misfolded proteins within SGs can trigger a transition from a fluid- to a solid-like state that is associated with disease ( Alberti and Hyman, 2016; Ganassi et al., 2016; Mackenzie et al., 2017; Mateju et al., 2017; Molliex et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015 4.

To reconstitute the liquid-to-solid transition of condensates in vitro , we added Ubc9(ts) ( Figure S2 A), a protein carrying a destabilizing temperature-sensitive mutation, to G3BP1-RNA condensates at permissive temperatures. Ubc9(ts) was slightly more enriched in G3BP1-RNA condensates compared to Ubc9(WT) ( Figure S2 J). G3BP1-RNA condensates in the absence or presence of equimolar Ubc9(WT) exhibited comparable fusion times, whereas the fusion times increased in the presence of Ubc9(ts) ( Figure 2 H; Video S3 ). The diffusion of Ubc9(ts) inside of G3BP1-RNA condensates was slower compared to Ubc9(WT) and the immobile fraction of Ubc9(ts) increased with time ( Figures 2 I and 2J). Importantly, Ubc9(ts) did not aggregate in solution ( Figure S2 K). These results suggest that the destabilized form of Ubc9 interacts more strongly with G3BP1-RNA condensates, subsequently solidifies, and inhibits condensate coalescence. Thus, aberrant interactions with misfolding-prone proteins inside condensates serve as nucleation sites for off-pathway aggregation that can ultimately change the material properties of the condensates.

Taken together, our reconstituted condensates recapitulate key features of G3BP1-positive SGs in cells. Hence, we used reconstituted G3BP1 condensates to study the molecular mechanisms driving SG assembly.
We next focused on the mechanism by which mRNA is specifically deposited in SGs. This specificity could be achieved through intermolecular base-pairing of RNA ( Van Treeck et al., 2018; Van Treeck and Parker, 2018 109. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Parker, R. Emerging Roles for Intermolecular RNA-RNA Interactions in RNP Assemblies Cell. 2018; 174 :791-802 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar 110. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) or by specific protein factors, with G3BP1 being a good candidate.
First we investigated whether in vitro phase separation of G3BP1 depends on specific types of RNAs. Total RNA and mRNA from human spinal cord induced phase separation of G3BP1, whereas ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the non-coding RNA NEAT1 ( Clemson et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2018 20. Clemson, C.M. ∙ Hutchinson, J.N. ∙ Sara, S.A. ... An architectural role for a nuclear noncoding RNA: NEAT1 RNA is essential for the structure of paraspeckles Mol. Cell. 2009; 33 :717-726 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (788) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Lin, Y. ∙ Schmidt, B.F. ∙ Bruchez, M.P. ... Structural analyses of NEAT1 lncRNAs suggest long-range RNA interactions that may contribute to paraspeckle architecture Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :3742-3752 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a synthetic 5-Loop RNA ( Hoell et al., 2011 41. Hoell, J.I. ∙ Larsson, E. ∙ Runge, S. ... RNA targets of wild-type and mutant FET family proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1428-1431 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ) were not efficient in inducing G3BP1 assemblies ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). To test whether the poly(A) tail of mRNAs is necessary to drive G3BP1 phase separation, we polyadenylated the 5-Loop RNA. Phase separation of G3BP1 was more efficient with polyadenylated 5-Loop RNA ( Figures S3 A and S3B). This result could be explained by G3BP1 specifically binding to long adenine-rich polynucleotides or to long unfolded regions in the RNA. Indeed, rRNA, NEAT1, and 5-Loop RNAs are highly structured. To distinguish sequence specificity from structural determinants, we compared the effects of poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U) RNAs on G3BP1 phase separation (the homopolymeric RNAs were polydisperse in length; STAR Methods ). All homopolynucleotides induced phase separation of G3BP1 ( Figure 3 B), demonstrating that G3BP1 does not interact exclusively with poly(A). A shorter poly(A) RNA (A60) did not induce phase separation of G3BP1 ( Figure 3 B), suggesting that the valence of nucleobases is important for establishing a network of interactions among RNA and G3BP1 molecules. We hypothesized that long unfolded RNA molecules are recognized by G3BP1. In agreement, G3BP1 formed condensates with unfolded rRNA, whereas minimal phase separation was observed with natively folded rRNA ( Figure 3 C). Moreover, entangled total RNA, in which extensive RNA-RNA interactions had already been established, did not induce G3BP1 phase separation ( Figures 3 D and S3 C; Jain and Vale, 2017 46. Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D. RNA phase transitions in repeat expansion disorders Nature. 2017; 546 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). We conclude that the specific binding of G3BP1 to long unfolded RNA regions drives SG assembly. Long unfolded regions are likely to be present in mRNAs that are released from polysomes upon stress ( Adivarahan et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2013; Khong and Parker, 2018; Mao et al., 2014; Qu et al., 2011 2.

SGs were initially proposed to shut down translation upon stress. More recent studies, however, suggest that stressed cells arrest translation independent of SGs ( Bley et al., 2015; Kedersha et al., 2016; Mollet et al., 2008 10. Bley, N. ∙ Lederer, M. ∙ Pfalz, B. ... Stress granules are dispensable for mRNA stabilization during cellular stress Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e26 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar 53.

Translationally repressed mRNA transiently cycles through stress granules during stress Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19 :4469-4479 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the kinetics and degree of translational shutdown and recovery upon transient oxidative stress were indistinguishable between cells expressing G3BPs and cells in which G3BPs were deleted ( Figures S3 D–S3F). SG assembly is triggered by a sudden release of protein-free and unfolded mRNAs from polysomes, which is unusual considering that mRNAs are coated with RBPs ( Mitchell and Parker, 2014; Müller-McNicoll and Neugebauer, 2013 79. Mitchell, S.F. ∙ Parker, R. Principles and properties of eukaryotic mRNPs Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :547-558 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Müller-McNicoll, M. ∙ Neugebauer, K.M. How cells get the message: dynamic assembly and function of mRNA-protein complexes Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14 :275-287 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that high amounts of free and unfolded mRNA could lead to RNA entanglement through aberrant RNA-RNA interactions and that G3BP1-RNA condensation could prevent it. We induced poly(G) RNA entanglement with high PEG concentrations ( Van Treeck et al., 2018 110. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the absence and presence of G3BP1. Poly(G) RNA adopted an amorphous tangled state ( Figure 3 E). When poly(G) RNA was premixed with G3BP1(WT), spherical G3BP1-poly(G) condensates formed ( Figure 3 E). Although poly(G) tangles stuck to each other, G3BP1-poly(G) condensates coalesced when brought together with optical tweezers ( Figure 3 F), demonstrating that G3BP1 facilitates a liquid-like assembly that inhibits RNA entanglement. The fusion time of the condensates increased monotonically with time ( Figure 3 F), suggesting that G3BP1 dynamically interacts with the RNA and that strong RNA-RNA interactions are established over time.
Considering the critical role of the NTF2 domain and the RG-rich region for G3BP1 condensate assembly, we compared the ability of these variants to bind RNA and prevent RNA entanglement. First, we determined the apparent K D of G3BP1 variants for A(60) RNA. A(60) RNA was chosen to prevent G3BP1 phase separation. G3BP1(WT) exhibited a high K D (∼2.0 μM) for A(60) RNA and bound the RNA cooperatively (apparent Hill coefficient, ∼4.5) ( Figures 3 G and S3 G). Long poly(A) RNA efficiently competed at ∼5-fold sub-stoichiometric molarities with the binding of A(60) RNA to G3BP1 ( Figure S3 H). Thus, G3BP1 is likely to bind cellular RNAs with greater affinity than the one determined with A(60). RNA binding did not depend on dimerization, as monomeric G3BP1(ΔNTF) bound RNA with an affinity (apparent K D , ∼1.7 μM) comparable with that of G3BP1(WT) ( Figures 3 G and S3 G). G3BP1(ΔRG) bound RNA with a slightly decreased affinity (apparent K D , ∼3.8 μM) and less cooperatively (apparent Hill coefficient, ∼2.3) compared with G3BP1(WT) ( Figures 3 G and S3 G). This suggests that G3BP1(ΔRG) binds RNA via the RRM and that the RG-rich region enhances cooperative binding.
Despite the ability of G3BP1(ΔNTF) to bind RNA efficiently ( Figures 3 G and S3 G), it did not prevent RNA entanglement, indicating that binding of G3BP1 to RNA is insufficient to prevent aberrant RNA-RNA interactions ( Figure 3 E). Next we asked whether the presence of condensates is sufficient to prevent RNA entanglement. G3BP1(ΔRG) condensates formed in the presence of PEG ( Figure S2 E) enriched poly(G) RNA and inhibited RNA entanglement, although the condensed phase was less than for G3BP1(WT) ( Figure 3 E). This indicates that the already high concentration of RNA binding sites within the condensate inhibits strong RNA-RNA interactions. We propose that G3BP1 condensates recruit RNA into fluid structures to inhibit strong, and most likely irreversible, RNA-RNA interactions.
G3BP1 contains a negatively charged, glutamate-rich (E-rich) region that is predicted to be intrinsically disordered ( Tourrière et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2016 107. Tourrière, H. ∙ Chebli, K. ∙ Zekri, L. ... The RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease G3BP assembles stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160 :823-831 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar 108. Tsai, W.-C. ∙ Gayatri, S. ∙ Reineke, L.C. ... Arginine Demethylation of G3BP1 Promotes Stress Granule Assembly J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :22671-22685 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 A). Despite almost no sequence conservation, the presence of an acidic glutamate-rich IDR is highly conserved ( Figures S7 B and S7C). We hypothesized that this IDR could be involved in setting the saturation concentration of G3BP1.
The carboxyl group of the glutamate side chain has an intrinsic pK a of 4.25, but glutamate side chains embedded in acidic clusters can have upshifted pK a that can be as high as 6.5 ( Fossat and Pappu, 2019; Franzmann et al., 2018; Harris and Turner, 2002; Ruggeri et al., 2017 31. Fossat, M.J. ∙ Pappu, R.V. q -Canonical Monte Carlo Sampling for Modeling the Linkage between Charge Regulation and Conformational Equilibria of Peptides J. Phys. Chem.

Single-molecule electrometry Nat. Nanotechnol. 2017; 12 :488-495 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined the phase separation of G3BP1(WT) as a function of pH in the presence of RNA but in the absence of PEG. Although phase separation of G3BP1(WT) was minimal at neutral pH, the fraction of phase-separated protein increased as the pH was lowered below 7.0 ( Figure 4 B). We hypothesized that the acidic IDR inhibits G3BP1 phase separation and that pH-dependent protonation of the clustered glutamates relieves this inhibition.
To provide evidence of a regulatory role of the acidic IDR, we designed two deletion variants (G3BP1(ΔE1) and G3BP1(ΔE2)) in which two conspicuous clusters of glutamates were removed ( Figure 4 A; Table S1 ). Although G3BP1(WT) did not undergo phase separation at neutral pH in the presence of RNA and absence of PEG, both deletion variants formed condensates even at low protein concentrations ( Figure 4 C). Lowering the pH further decreased the saturation concentration of the deletion variants and promoted phase separation even in the absence of RNA ( Figures S4 A and S4B). To test whether the two glutamate clusters act in concert to inhibit G3BP1 phase separation, we generated the G3BP1(ΔE1ΔE2) variant. All three E-deletion variants phase-separated more efficiently than G3BP1(WT) following an increase in the fraction phase-separated as a function of the charge depletion ( Figure 4 D). G3BP1(ΔE1ΔE2) formed condensates at neutral pH independent of RNA and PEG ( Figure 4 D), highlighting that the acidic region exerts an autoinhibitory role that ensures RNA-dependent G3BP1 phase separation. We confirmed this finding in U2OS G3BP1/G3BP2 knockout (KO) cells by taking advantage of the stochasticity of transient transfection. In non-stressed cells, overexpression of G3BP1(WT) yielded SGs in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 4 E). Compared with the WT, the saturation concentration of the ΔE1ΔE2 variant was reduced ( Figure 4 E), demonstrating that the E-stretch exerts its autoinhibitory effect in living cells. The onset of sodium arsenate-induced SG assembly was decreased for cells expressing G3BP1(ΔE1ΔE2) compared with G3BP1(WT) ( Figure 4 F), but the differences in the kinetics were small. We interpret this result to reflect the fact that, under stress conditions, the mRNA release from polysomes is the main driver of SG assembly ( Figure 1 C). Although the number of SGs formed by G3BP1(WT) decreased after the initial growth phase, the number of SGs formed by G3BP1(ΔE1ΔE2) remained high ( Figure 4 F), suggesting an impairment of coalescence. In agreement with the acidic IDR also being a determinant of the viscoelastic properties of G3BP1 in the condensed phase, the average size of SGs formed by G3BP1(ΔE1ΔE2) was smaller ( Figures S4 C and S4D). We conclude that the acidic IDR is a negative regulator of G3BP1 phase behavior that locks G3BP1 in a state that disfavors phase separation.
The acidic IDR is flanked by residues S149 and S232, both of which can be phosphorylated ( Hornbeck et al., 2015 43. Hornbeck, P.V. ∙ Zhang, B. ∙ Murray, B. ... PhosphoSitePlus, 2014: mutations, PTMs and recalibrations Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D512-D520 Crossref Scopus (944) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 A). The role of these phosphosites in SG assembly is still under debate ( Panas et al., 2019; Sahoo et al., 2018 88. Panas, M.D. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Schulte, T. ... Phosphorylation of G3BP1-S149 does not influence stress granule assembly J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218 :2425-2432 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar 97. Sahoo, P.K. ∙ Lee, S.J. ∙ Jaiswal, P.B. ... Axonal G3BP1 stress granule protein limits axonal mRNA translation and nerve regeneration Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3358 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that phosphorylation of G3BP1 could be a mechanism to tune the saturation concentration by altering the net negative charge of the acidic IDR. G3BP1(WT) purified from insect cells was phosphorylated on both sites ( Figure S4 E and mass spectrometry analysis, data not shown). Dephosphorylation of G3BP1(WT) reduced the saturation concentration ( Figure S4 F). Compared with phosphorylated G3BP1(WT), G3BP1(S149A) had a reduced saturation concentration, which was even lower for G3BP1(S149A/S232A) ( Figure S4 F). Conversely, the phosphomimetic G3BP1(S149E) showed intermediate behavior, phase-separating less efficiently than G3BP1(S149A) but more efficiently than G3BP1(WT) ( Figure S4 F). All phospho-variants formed stable dimers, as opposed to previous reports suggesting that phosphorylation induces monomerization of G3BP1 ( Figure S4 E; Table S1 ; Tourrière et al., 2003 107. Tourrière, H. ∙ Chebli, K. ∙ Zekri, L. ... The RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease G3BP assembles stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160 :823-831 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Taken together our data demonstrate that the net charge of the acidic IDR is a determinant of the saturation concentration of G3BP1. Reversible phosphorylation may be one mechanism that cells employ to tune the sensitivity of G3BP1 toward RNA-mediated phase separation, likely as part of a more complex regulatory system.
At least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms exist by which the acidic IDR could influence the saturation concentration of G3BP1: (1) the net-negative charge of the IDR could increase the solubility of G3BP1, and/or (2) the acidic IDR could interact with the positively charged RG-rich region and compete for RNA-protein and/or protein-protein interactions. All-atom simulations identified long-range electrostatic interactions between the RG-rich region and the acidic IDR in a G3BP1(ΔNTF) monomeric construct ( Figures 5 A and 5B; S5 A and S5B). These electrostatic interactions drive global chain compaction. We measured the dimensions of G3BP1 using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). G3BP1(WT) diffused as a dimer with an apparent hydrodynamic radius (R H ) of 5.9 nm (±0.3 nm) ( Figure 5 C; Table S1 ). For reference, simulations of dimeric G3BP1, based on a self-avoiding representation for the disordered regions, yielded a R H of ∼10 nm ( Figure 5 C), demonstrating that the dimer in solution is more compact. The compaction decreased as a function of increased salt concentration ( Figure 5 D), implying that screening of the electrostatic interactions causes chain expansion. Accordingly, the R H of G3BP1(ΔRG) increased by ∼13% compared with WT and deletion of the E1 or E2 clusters led to a broader distribution for the R H ( Figure 5 E), supporting the idea of a heterogeneous conformational ensemble that includes expanded and compact states that exchange with one another.
Dephosphorylated G3BP1(WT) as well as G3BP1(S149A/S232A) adopted more expanded conformations in solution compared with phosphorylated G3BP1(WT) ( Figure S5 C), demonstrating that the net charge of G3BP1 determines its compactness. Consistent with this idea, G3BP1 adopted a more expanded state at pH 6.0 compared with pH 7.5 ( Figure 5 F). Importantly, the saturation concentration of RNA-mediated G3BP1 phase separation was reduced at pH 6.0 ( Figures 4 B, 4C, and S4 A). Taken together, our data support a coupled conformational equilibrium in which the compact state of G3BP1 is stabilized by intramolecular electrostatic interactions between the acidic IDR and the RG-rich region. Destabilization of these interactions causes G3BP1 expansion, facilitating intermolecular protein-RNA and/or protein-protein interactions that drive condensation.
The conformational dynamics of G3BP1 could regulate the RNA-binding affinity or the affinity between G3BP1 molecules. Both E cluster deletion variants as well as the S149A phospho-null variant, exhibited RNA-binding affinities comparable with G3BP1(WT) ( Figure S5 D). This suggests that the acidic IDR does not regulate the RNA-binding affinity of G3BP1 but, instead, modulates the interplay between intra- and intermolecular protein-protein interactions.
DLS revealed a small oligomeric fraction of G3BP1 at neutral pH. This oligomeric fraction increased at pH 6.0 and was reduced by increasing the salt concentration ( Figures 5 G and S5 E), demonstrating that G3BP1 oligomers are in reversible equilibrium with dimers. Additionally, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments identified an RNA-bound oligomeric species for G3BP1(WT), G3BP1(S149A), and the E cluster deletion variants, suggesting that these variants associate into larger oligomeric species when bound to RNA ( Figure S5 D). The oligomeric species was not detected for the G3BP1(ΔRG) variant ( Figure S3 G). Presumably, the RG-rich region engages in protein-protein interactions when bound to RNA, stabilizing an oligomeric state of RNA-bound G3BP1. We analyzed G3BP1(WT) and G3BP1(ΔRG) at increasing concentrations of A(60) RNA by analytical size exclusion chromatography. G3BP1(WT) in the absence of RNA eluted as a dimer with a retention volume of ∼10.5 mL ( Figure 5 H). The elution peak shifted toward smaller retention volumes in the presence of RNA, indicating formation of higher-molecular-weight complexes ( Figure 5 H). G3BP1(ΔRG) did not assemble into larger oligomeric complexes and eluted as a dimer irrespective of A(60) ( Figure 5 H). These results show that the RG-rich region of G3BP1 increases the RNA-binding affinity and mediates protein-protein interactions that stabilize G3BP1 molecules in complex with RNA.
We generated an ultra-coarse-grained computational model ( Figure 6 A) to predict emergent structures that result from the interplay among protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions involving distinct modules of G3BP1. For simplicity, our model was designed to describe homopolymeric RNAs (as in Figure 3 B). Although our model did not encode RNA-RNA interactions, such interactions most likely do occur for non-homopolymeric RNAs and provide an additional layer of intra-condensate interactions. We first examined the effects of G3BP1-RNA interactions with a short (∼60-nt) RNA. For a model in which weak RG-mediated protein-protein interactions were allowed, the simulations indicated that G3BP1 oligomerizes on short RNA molecules without driving phase separation ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Larger numbers of higher valence oligomers were formed as the RNA concentration was increased. When RG-RG interactions were ablated, neither RNA binding nor oligomerization was observed ( Figure 6 B).
Our simulations indicated that some RNA molecules were coated with G3BP1, whereas others lacked bound protein ( Figure 6 C). This pearl necklace architecture is a hallmark of cooperative binding ( Dubiel et al., 2019; Lohman and Ferrari, 1994 26. Dubiel, K. ∙ Myers, A.R. ∙ Kozlov, A.G. ... Structural Mechanisms of Cooperative DNA Binding by Bacterial Single-Stranded DNA-Binding Proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431 :178-195 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar 66. Lohman, T.M. ∙ Ferrari, M.E. Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein: multiple DNA-binding modes and cooperativities Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63 :527-570 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In our simulations, RNA-bound G3BP1 exchanged with a soluble pool of dimers, pointing to dynamic oligomers. These results suggest that RNA provides a surface upon which protein-protein interactions can occur.
We next considered systems with longer RNAs (800–1,000 nt). G3BP1 formed dynamic clusters of ∼50–100 G3BP1 dimers that decorated the long RNA molecules ( Figure 6 D). These clusters interacted with one another (and with RNA) to physically crosslink RNA molecules, forming an expanded meshwork that gave rise to higher-order assembly. We predicted that protein-protein interactions drive two distinct layers of cooperativity: cluster formation and inter-cluster crosslinking. Thus, our results suggest that G3BP1-RNA condensates are not a uniformly dense environment. Instead, clusters accumulate at distinct foci along the RNA, acting as emergent “stickers” ( Figure 6 E) ( Choi et al., 2020 19. Choi, J.-M. ∙ Holehouse, A.M. ∙ Pappu, R.V. Physical Principles Underlying the Complex Biology of Intracellular Phase Transitions. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2020; 49 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, G3BP1-RNA condensates are predicted to have mesh-like structures with inhomogeneous distributions of crosslinks.
Based on the simulations, the concentration of G3BP1 in the condensates will be low because G3BP1 is mainly a physical crosslinker among RNA molecules. Thus, we used optical diffraction tomography to determine the total concentration of G3BP1-RNA condensates from refractive index measurements. G3BP1-RNA condensates had a refractive index of ∼1.35 ( Figures 6 F and 6G); thus, the total mass concentration in G3BP1-RNA condensates averaged ∼65 mg/mL ( Figure 6 G). This was substantially lower than estimates for protein-only condensates, which can reach ∼400 mg/mL ( Brady et al., 2017; Burke et al., 2015 13. Brady, J.P. ∙ Farber, P.J. ∙ Sekhar, A. ... Structural and hydrodynamic properties of an intrinsically disordered region of a germ cell-specific protein on phase separation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E8194-E8203 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar 16. Burke, K.A. ∙ Janke, A.M. ∙ Rhine, C.L. ... Residue-by-Residue View of In Vitro FUS Granules that Bind the C-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II Mol. Cell. 2015; 60 :231-241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). G3BP1 was enriched ∼7-fold within G3BP1-RNA condensates ( Figures S6 A and S6B), reaching a total concentration of ∼1 mg/mL (∼15 μM) ( Figure 6 H). This effective low concentration of G3BP1 supports our notion that G3BP1 acts as a cross-linker of long unfolded RNA molecules and demonstrates that reconstituted G3BP1-RNA condensates consist predominantly of RNA (∼64 mg/mL poly(A) RNA). We further tested our predictions using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) ( Figures S6 C–S6F; Video S4 ), which revealed that G3BP1-RNA condensates are indeed inhomogeneous and suggested that G3BP1 forms clusters that are spaced apart (presumably by RNA-mediated crosslinks that are too thin to be resolved).

Our simulations predicted that G3BP1 clusters engender a multivalence of RG-rich regions. This should give rise to a multivalence of arginine motifs, which are known to serve as stickers that enable physical crosslinks ( Harmon et al., 2017b; Posey et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018 38. Harmon, T.S. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Rosen, M.K. ... Intrinsically disordered linkers determine the interplay between phase separation and gelation in multivalent proteins eLife. 2017; 6 :e30294 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 91. Posey, A.E. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Pappu, R.V. Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Methods Enzymol. 2018; 611 :1-30 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar 116. Wang, J. ∙ Choi, J.-M. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ... A Molecular Grammar Governing the Driving Forces for Phase Separation of Prion-like RNA Binding Proteins Cell. 2018; 174 :688-699.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extent of crosslinking and condensate assembly should be controlled by the valence of arginine residues within RG-rich regions. G3BP2 is a G3BP1 homolog with more arginine residues within the RG-rich region ( Figure S7 A). Indeed, the phase-separated fraction was higher for G3BP2 compared with G3BP1 in protein-only systems ( Figure 7 A) and in RNA-dependent phase separation ( Figure 7 B). Like G3BP1, G3BP2 also adopted a compact state that was stabilized by electrostatic interactions ( Figure 7 C). DLS measurements also revealed that G3BP2 formed reversible oligomers at pH 7 ( Figure 7 D), as opposed to G3BP1, for which oligomers were only evident when the intramolecular interactions were weakened at pH 6 ( Figure 5 G). Although G3BP2 formed oligomers at pH 7, it still required RNA to phase-separate at low PEG concentrations ( Figures 7 A and 7B). We conclude that the higher valence of arginine residues within the RG-rich region renders G3BP2 more prone to oligomerize and, consequently, more efficient to form condensates together with RNA.

Section: Discussion

A prevailing challenge in the condensate field is to understand how nanoscale conformational transitions and interactions drive the assembly of micron-sized cellular structures with high spatial and temporal precision. Here we focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying SG assembly. We demonstrate that SGs form by phase separation and provide a mechanistic understanding of how interactions between G3BP and unfolded, protein-free RNA molecules that are released during stress from polysomes drive SG assembly. Our data support a model in which RNA-induced conformational switching of G3BP promotes condensate assembly with specificity for unfolded RNA to inhibit strong RNA-RNA interactions, hinting at a potential role of G3BP as an RNA chaperone.
Phase separation requires establishment of a network of multivalent interactions ( Banani et al., 2017 9. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Crossref Scopus (834) PubMed Google Scholar ). For RNA-driven G3BP1 phase separation, the increase in valence is partly contributed by the RNA and by the ability of G3BP1 to dimerize. The molecular mechanism underlying regulation of available valences for phase separation is the ability of G3BP to undergo an RNA-induced conformational rearrangement. Under non-stress conditions, G3BP dimers adopt an autoinhibited compact state that sequesters the RG-rich region through electrostatic interactions with the central acidic IDR. Upon stress, released mRNA outcompetes this intramolecular interaction and induces expansion of G3BP, releasing the RG-rich region to engage in multivalent heterotypic protein-RNA and homotypic intermolecular protein-protein interactions, which allow cooperative binding of RNA and condensate assembly ( Figure 7 E). Indeed, multivalent intermolecular interactions among G3BP dimers can be established independent of RNA and are facilitated by the RG-rich region. However, these interactions require either high local protein concentrations or removal of the inhibitory acidic IDR. The sequence-encoded arginine content in the RG-rich region of G3BPs provides control over the driving forces for condensation. The transition from a compact to an expanded state is the crucial molecular event that switches G3BP from an auto-inhibited state defined by intramolecular interactions to a multivalent state in which intermolecular interactions dominate. This mechanism of conformationally controlled multivalence may be a more general feature of scaffold proteins that drive condensate assembly via phase separation. In fact, many RBPs have similar architectures as G3BP and, thus, could use a comparable mechanism for conformationally regulated, RNA-dependent RNP granule assembly.
How can cells tune the sensitivity of RNA-dependent conformational switching? We propose that the conformational transition and the phase behavior of G3BP are regulated by site-specific phosphorylation at S149 and S232. These phosphorylation sites are conserved between G3BP1 and G3BP2 and flank the acidic IDR. Changes in S149 phosphorylation state were thought to affect SG assembly ( Kedersha et al., 2016; Reineke et al., 2017; Tourrière et al., 2003 53. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar 95.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160 :823-831 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a recent study has called the effect of the used phosphomimetic G3BP variants into question ( Panas et al., 2019 88. Panas, M.D. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Schulte, T. ... Phosphorylation of G3BP1-S149 does not influence stress granule assembly J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218 :2425-2432 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together with ( Yang et al., 2020 120. Yang, P. ∙ Mathieu, C. ∙ Kolaitis, R.M. ... G3BP1 Is a Tunable Switch that Triggers Phase Separation to Assemble Stress Granules Cell. 2020; 181 :325-345 this issue Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ( Sanders et al., 2020 98. Sanders, D.W. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Lee, D.S.W. ... Competing Protein-RNA Interaction Networks Control Multiphase Intracellular Organization Cell. 2020; 181 :306-324 this issue Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reinvestigated the role of G3BP phosphorylation and found that phosphorylation of S149 and S232 diminishes the driving force of phase separation, presumably by tuning the strength of the auto-inhibitory interaction between the acidic and the RG-rich IDRs. This provides a first example of how post-translational modifications could regulate the transition of a molecule into a multivalent state to promote condensate assembly.
The reconstituted condensates primarily consist of RNA crosslinked by clustered G3BP molecules. The amount of clustered G3BP is small in these condensates, and not all binding sites on the RNA molecules appear to be saturated. Indeed, a wide range of RBPs that are known clients of SGs in cells enrich within reconstituted condensates, likely through specific RNA binding. Many of these RBPs are nuclear and must leave the nucleus before they accumulate in cytoplasmic SGs. Our data suggest that G3BP-RNA condensates act as recruiting centers and assembly platforms for various RBPs because of the high RNA concentration within the condensates and the specific RNA-binding preferences of the client RBPs.
One special RBP we tested is the G3BP-interacting protein Caprin-1 ( Solomon et al., 2007 101. Solomon, S. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Wang, B. ... Distinct structural features of caprin-1 mediate its interaction with G3BP-1 and its induction of phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha, entry to cytoplasmic stress granules, and selective interaction with a subset of mRNAs Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27 :2324-2342 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Caprin-1 is a cytoplasmic protein that only weakly partitions into G3BP1-RNA condensates but shifts the saturation concentration by an order of magnitude. The effect of Caprin-1 is explained by the concept of polyphasic linkage ( Wyman and Gill, 1980 119. Wyman, J. ∙ Gill, S.J. Ligand-linked phase changes in a biological system: applications to sickle cell hemoglobin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1980; 77 :5239-5242 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In this scenario, preferential binding of a ligand to scaffold molecules in the condensate will lead to a downshift in saturation concentrations. Our results point to a three-way linkage phenomenon involving G3BP1, RNA, and Caprin-1, which is supported by the finding that the affinity of G3BP1 for RNA increases in the presence of Caprin-1. This is likely to be a more general phenomenon that might extend to other SG proteins such as UBAP2L, CSDE1, and PRRC2C ( Markmiller et al., 2018; Youn et al., 2018 72. Markmiller, S. ∙ Soltanieh, S. ∙ Server, K.L. ... Context-Dependent and Disease-Specific Diversity in Protein Interactions within Stress Granules Cell. 2018; 172 :590-604.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar 121. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, regulation of scaffold molecules through polyphasic linkage could be an important mechanism of adapting the saturation concentrations of phase-separating protein systems in response to environmental stimuli.
In agreement with previous work ( Bley et al., 2015; Kedersha et al., 2016; Mollet et al., 2008 10. Bley, N. ∙ Lederer, M. ∙ Pfalz, B. ... Stress granules are dispensable for mRNA stabilization during cellular stress Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e26 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar 53.

Translationally repressed mRNA transiently cycles through stress granules during stress Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19 :4469-4479 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), we find that SG assembly is not required for translational arrest upon stress. Our data instead suggest an important role of G3BP1 in regulating the physical properties of RNA assemblies. Recent work has highlighted the ability of RNA to aggregate via RNA-RNA interactions ( Jain and Vale, 2017; Van Treeck et al., 2018 46. Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D. RNA phase transitions in repeat expansion disorders Nature. 2017; 546 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar 110. Van Treeck, B. ∙ Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Matheny, T. ... RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). The aggregation of RNA may be particularly likely during stress because stress causes a sudden release of unfolded and protein-free mRNAs from polysomes. We show that sequestration of unfolded RNA into G3BP1 condensates inhibits aggregation of RNA. Based on this, we speculate that G3BP condensates could function as RNA chaperones that assist with RNA homeostasis. Further, the inhomogeneous nature of G3BP-RNA condensates points to a strategy for minimizing RNA-RNA interactions by engaging RNA molecules in physical crosslinks that keep them apart. The degree to which this strategy is employed by other RBPs remains to be determined. However, recent studies emphasized recruitment of RNA helicases to G3BP-RNA condensates in cells ( Jain et al., 2016; Tauber et al., 2020 47. Jain, S. ∙ Wheeler, J.R. ∙ Walters, R.W. ... ATPase-Modulated Stress Granules Contain a Diverse Proteome and Substructure Cell. 2016; 164 :487-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar 104.

Although G3BPs play a central role in condensate assembly and inhibition of initial RNA aggregation, it seems likely that helicases assist with this process to support RNA homeostasis.
Several studies have highlighted the inhomogeneous distribution of RBPs within RNP granules ( Fang et al., 2019; Jain et al., 2016; Niewidok et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2014; Wheeler et al., 2016 27.

Wheeler, J.R. ∙ Matheny, T. ∙ Jain, S. ... Distinct stages in stress granule assembly and disassembly eLife. 2016; 5 Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar ). This led to the proposal that RNP granules contain core-like structures in which specific proteins are concentrated and protein mobility is reduced. A recent study used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to follow the diffusion of individual G3BP1 molecules in SGs ( Niewidok et al., 2018 86. Niewidok, B. ∙ Igaev, M. ∙ Pereira da Graca, A. ... Single-molecule imaging reveals dynamic biphasic partition of RNA-binding proteins in stress granules J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :1303-1318 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). The authors reported the presence of distributed hotspots within SGs in which G3BP1 molecules were relatively immobile. We propose that these structures are analogous to the clusters we report here. Indeed, our modeling and cryo-EM data support the notion that G3BP forms multivalent clusters on RNA that crosslink RNA molecules into an inhomogeneous network. This raises the possibility that the observed inhomogeneous distribution of RBPs within RNP granules could be the result of a condensation process in which protein clusters generate the emergent valence that enables reversible physical crosslinks that network long RNA molecules.
In summary, we describe an essential role of the scaffold proteins G3BPs in the assembly of RNP granules. G3BP harnesses the criticality of phase separation to form liquid condensates in response to local changes in RNA concentration. In effect, G3BPs are cellular sensors of protein-free unfolded RNA, a feature that may also be of critical importance for recognition of foreign DNA or RNA. At the heart of this mechanism is a conformational switch that couples RNA binding to a dramatic increase in multivalence. This promotes formation of G3BP clusters that drive condensation by crosslinking RNA. We predict that such phase-separating and crosslinking scaffolds are widespread molecular devices because of their ability to detect sudden changes in physical-chemical conditions and mount stimulus-specific physiological responses.

U2OS G3BP1/2 knockout cells were a gift from Nancy Kedersha.
HeLa and U2OS cells were cultured in 4500 mg/l glucose GlutaMAX DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (GIBCO). Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . HeLa G3BP1(WT)-mCherry BAC cells were grown in the presence of 5 μg/ml Blasticidin (GIBCO).
Passivated glass coverslips were prepared according to Alberti et al. (2018) 5. Alberti, S. ∙ Saha, S. ∙ Woodruff, J.B. ... A user’s guide for phase separation assays with purified proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4806-4820 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar . In short: coverslips were incubated with PEG-silane solution (0.4% (v/v) PEG-silane (1 g/ml) and 0.16% (v/v) HCl (37%) in toluene) overnight. Coverslips were then washed with toluene, followed by two washes with 100% ethanol and two washes with distilled water. Coverslips were then dried with compressed air.
Please refer to the plasmid summary table ( Table S2 ).
Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Oxidative stress was induced by treating cells with 1 mM sodium arsenate in regular cell culture conditions.
HeLa G3BP1(WT)-mCherry cells were grown and treated as previously stated. Imaging was performed at 37°C with a lattice light-sheet microscope with a voxel size of 104 nm in XY and 250 nm in Z. Imaging of early G3BP1 foci started 6 min after arsenate stress. 1000 time points (frame time interval 0.895 s), each one consisting of 61 z-planes, were acquired. For late SGs, imaging started 24 min after arsenate stress. 850 time points (frame time interval 1.430 s) were recorded, each time point consisting of 61 z-planes. Fluorescence excitation was with a 589 nm laser (MBP Communications) with a dithered square lattice (NAin = 0.325, NAout = 0.4) using a custom objective (Special Optics, 28.6X NA = 0.7). Fluorescence emission was recorded with a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA4) using a 25x NA = 1.1 objective (Nikon 25x Nikon CFI APO LWD) through a bandpass filter, centered on the mCherry emission (Semrock FF01-629/53-25). Prior imaging, the correction collar of the detection objective was adjusted to match the refractive index of the imaging medium. Deconvolution was performed on a graphics processing unit, using a point spread function measured before each experiment and an iterative Richardson-Lucy algorithm.
Live cells were imaged at 37°C and 5% CO 2 using either a DeltaVision Core (Applied Precision) or a DeltaVision Elite microscope (GE Healthcare) with a 60x/1.42 NA/UPlanSA oil immersion objective mounted on an inverted Olympus IX71 stand. Cells were imaged in 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Coop.) or in 8-well slides (80826, Ibidi) in 4500 mg/l glucose DMEM without phenol red (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO) and penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO).
U2OS cells (WT or G3BP1/2 KO cells) were seeded with a Thermo MultiDrop dispenser into a Greiner μClear 384 well plate (Greiner Cat #781092) and treated as described in the previous sections. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde diluted in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS and subsequently permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr and incubated overnight with primary antibodies (goat anti-eIF3η (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-16377) diluted 1:2000 and rabbit anti-G3BP1 (Thermo Fisher, PA5-29455) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat Alexa-647 and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution). The cytoplasm was stained with CellMaskBlue (Invitrogen) and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Invitrogen). Images were acquired on an automated confocal microscope Yokogawa cv7000 with a 40x 0.95 NA air lens.
HeLa G3BP1(WT)-mCherry cells were grown in cell culture dishes (MatTek Coop.) and treated with sodium arsenate as previously stated. After SGs had formed, cells were permeabilized and SGs were stabilized with 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 5% (w/v) PEG-20K. SGs were dissolved by adding 2.5 mg/ml RNase A.
U2OS cells (WT or G3BP1/2 KO) were grown and treated as described previously. Cells were stressed with 1 mM sodium arsenate and allowed to recover in fresh media for the indicated times. Before collection, cells were treated with 91 μM of Puromycin for 5 min at 37°C. As control for specific puromycin incorporation into nascent polypeptide chains, cells were pre-treated with 2 μg/ml Harringtonine for 15 min before puromycin addition. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences)). Cell extracts were centrifuged 5 min at maximum speed and 4°C and the supernatant was recovered. 10 μg of protein extracts were loaded into SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot. Antibodies against Puromycin (Merck Millipore), p(S52)-eIF2a (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and eIF2a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to assess translation levels and follow stress kinetics. Relative translation levels (Puromycin signal) were quantified using Fiji and Excel.
Ubc9WT-6xHis and Ubc9ts-6xHis were purified as described previously ( Mateju et al., 2017 75. Mateju, D. ∙ Franzmann, T.M. ∙ Patel, A. ... An aberrant phase transition of stress granules triggered by misfolded protein and prevented by chaperone function EMBO J. 2017; 36 :1669-1687 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short: Ubc9WT-6xHis and Ubc9TS-6xHis were expressed in E. coli One Shot BL21 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell lysis was in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 350 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole, 2 mM DTT, and 1 × EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science) using an EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin). The cleared lysate was applied to Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) and the resin was washed with lysis buffer. Elution of the bound protein was with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 350 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 250 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and applied to a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT. Elution fractions were then applied to HiTrap SP Sepharose (GE Life Sciences) and eluted with a ten-fold linear salt gradient from 50 mM to 500 mM KCl. The protein was dialyzed against 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, flash-frozen, and stored at −80°C.
Recombinant 6xHis-GFP-G3BP1-MBP (WT and variants), 6xHis-MBP-SNAP-G3BP1(WT), 6xHis-GFP-G3BP2(WT)-MBP and 6xHis-MBP-mCherry-Caprin-1 were expressed in and purified from insect cells using a baculovirus expression system ( Hoell et al., 2011 41. Hoell, J.I. ∙ Larsson, E. ∙ Runge, S. ... RNA targets of wild-type and mutant FET family proteins Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :1428-1431 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jarvis, 2014 49. Jarvis, D.L. Recombinant protein expression in baculovirus-infected insect cells. Methods in Enzymology. 2014; 536 :149-163 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were lysed using EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin) in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT and 1x EDTA-containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Sciences). The lysate soluble fraction was collected after centrifugation for 30 min at maximum speed and 10°C. Amylose resin (New England Biolabs) was used to capture the protein of interest via the MBP tag from the supernatant of the cell lysate. The protein was eluted from the amylose column with lysis buffer containing 10 mM maltose. The samples were then applied to Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) via 6xHis tag. The column was washed with an EDTA-free lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The protein was subsequently eluted from Ni-NTA column with 250 mM imidazole. His and MBP tags were cleaved off with GST-tagged Prescission protease during an overnight dialysis against 5 l lysis buffer. Caprin-1 was purified only by affinity purification using Ni-NTA, following the same procedure as for G3BP1. Samples were applied to size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg (GE Life Sciences) on an Akta Ettan FPLC system, in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT buffer. Proteins were concentrated to 80-160 μM using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore). Aliquots were flash-frozen and stored at −80°C.
Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. NEAT1 and 5-Loop RNAs were transcribed from the corresponding linearized plasmids. In vitro transcription was carried out with 25 U/μl T7 polymerase (Protein expression and purification facility, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics) and 5 μM of linearized plasmid DNA, in 40 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM Spermidine, 10 mM freshly added DTT, 5 U/μl of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) and 2 mM of each ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP (Roche), at 42°C for 90 min. After transcription, 0.5 U/μl DNase I (NEB) were added and the sample was incubated at 37°C for 60 min. DNase I was heat-inactivated at 75°C for 10 min and 5 mM EDTA were added. The RNA was then purified using the RNAeasy Mini Kit, eluted in RNase free water and stored at −20°C. Alternatively, RNAs were transcribed with mMESSAGE T7 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher) and polyadenylated with Poly(A) Tailing Kit (ThermoFisher), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
When specified, rRNA was unfolded by heating 5 min at 95°C and cooling on ice. In order to form RNA tangles, 0.5 μg/μl of total RNA isolated from HeLa cells was diluted in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 and heated 3 min at 95°C. Following heating, the RNA was cooled down to 20°C in a thermocycler (cooling speed was 20°C/min) (adapted from Jain and Vale (2017) 46. Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D. RNA phase transitions in repeat expansion disorders Nature. 2017; 546 :243-247 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). RNA entanglement was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after staining with the F22 dye ( Li and Chang, 2006 63. Li, Q. ∙ Chang, Y.-T. A protocol for preparing, characterizing and using three RNA-specific, live cell imaging probes: E36, E144 and F22 Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2922-2932 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fraction of entanglement was determined by UV/Vis quantification of the soluble RNA after entanglement followed by 15 min centrifugation at 4°C and maximum speed.
For G3BP1-RNA condensate formation, unless specified, 5 μM of GFP-G3BP1 were incubated with RNA (either total RNA, mRNA, ribosomal RNA, NEAT1, 5-Loop, 5-Loop-poly(A), A(60), poly(A), poly(G), poly(C) or poly(U)) in 20 mM PIPES/KOH (pH 6.0 - 7.5), 85 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 and, when stated, 1% PEG-20K (w/v). Typically, 75 ng/μl RNA were used. Homopolymeric RNAs were heterogeneous in length, Bioanalyzer analysis revealed the following distributions: poly(A), 500-4000 nucleotides; poly(C), 1-2000 nucleotides; poly(G), 50-500 nucleotides; poly(U), 200-2000 nucleotides. For determining the phase behavior of GFP-G3BP1, the protein concentration, the RNA concentration, and the KCl concentration were titrated. For protein only condensates, GFP-G3BP1 was tested in 20 mM PIPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 85 mM KCl and increasing PEG-20K (Merck) concentrations (0%–8% w/v)
Samples were placed onto PEG-passivated coverslips and mounted on microscopy slides using double-sided sticky tape ( Alberti et al., 2018 5. Alberti, S. ∙ Saha, S. ∙ Woodruff, J.B. ... A user’s guide for phase separation assays with purified proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4806-4820 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). The samples were imaged immediately after preparation using Olympus IX81 Inverted Spinning Disc Microscope equipped with Andor iXON 897 EMCCD camera and UPlanSApo 100x oil immersion objective (Olympus). Alternatively, condensates were prepared in non-binding 384-well plates (Greiner bio-one) and imaged with a DeltaVision Elite (GE Healthcare) microscope using a 20x/0.75 UPlanSApo objective. For quantification, condensates were allowed to settle on the surface.
In vitro samples were mounted on pegylated glass slides ( Alberti et al., 2018 5. Alberti, S. ∙ Saha, S. ∙ Woodruff, J.B. ... A user’s guide for phase separation assays with purified proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4806-4820 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were grown in 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Coop.). Fluorescence bleaching experiments were carried out using Olympus IX81 Inverted Spinning Disc Microscope equipped with Andor iXON 897 EMCCD camera and a FRAPPA unit (Andor). Imaging was carried out using an UPlanSApo 100x (NA 1.4) oil immersion objective (Olympus). Fluorescence excitation was with 1% of a 50 mW 488 nm (Coherent Sapphire) and 5% of a 50 mW 561 nm laser (Cobolt Jive) for GFP and mCherry or Cy3 labeled proteins, respectively. Exposure time was typically 50 ms. A region of 10x10 pixels (∼0.82 μm x 0.82 μm) was selected within a droplet and bleached with 100% of a 100 mW 405 nm diode laser (Cairn OptoLED lite) and a 50 ms dwell time. The fluorescence intensity was recorded for 10 frames prior to the bleach and the recovery of fluorescence was recorded at 2 frames/s for 120 s or 240 frames.
SNAP-tagged G3BP1 was mixed with SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor 546 (NEB) at a ratio of 20:1 at RT for 5 min. To remove free dye, the protein was buffer exchanged using Protein Desalting Spin Columns (ThermoFisher) into 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl and 1 mM DTT. SNAP(546)-G3BP1-RNA condensates were formed at a concentration of 5 μM G3BP1(WT) and 25 ng/μl total RNA in 20 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 85 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1% (w/v) PEG-20K. Thereafter, 150 nM GFP-tagged client proteins were added. Samples were mounted on pegylated glass slides and imaged after 20 min. Client enrichment in G3BP1 droplets (ratio of client mean fluorescence intensity inside of G3BP1 droplets over client mean fluorescence intensity outside of droplets) was quantified using the FIJI software and subsequently plotted using RStudio software package. For Caprin-1 partitioning assays, 2.5 μM mCherry-Caprin-1 were added to preformed GFP-G3BP1(WT)-RNA condensates.
Purified Ubc9 samples were dialyzed against 50 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, and 2 mM EDTA for 3 h at 4°C. Samples were then mixed with Cy3 (Invitrogen) at equimolar concentrations and incubated for 2 h at 25°C. The Ubc9/Cy3 mixture was then dialyzed against 50 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT overnight.
Controlled coalescence of phase separated GFP-G3BP1-RNA condensates with and without Ubc9WT or Ubc9ts, as well as GFP-G3BP1-poly(G) condensates, were performed using a custom-built dual-trap optical tweezer microscope ( Jahnel et al., 2011 45. Jahnel, M. ∙ Behrndt, M. ∙ Jannasch, A. ... Measuring the complete force field of an optical trap. Optics Letters. 2011; 36 :1260-1262 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Condensates were trapped with two optical traps and brought into contact to induce fusion. Normalization of the coalescence times was carried out by scaling of the apparent coalescence time with the characteristic condensate size, which was calculated as the geometric mean between the two condensate radii before fusion. Condensate radii were determined by image analysis using FIJI. The laser signal of the coalescence process was normalized to the plateau value of a stretched exponential fit and data were plotted using the RStudio software package (( Wang et al., 2018 116. Wang, J. ∙ Choi, J.-M. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ... A Molecular Grammar Governing the Driving Forces for Phase Separation of Prion-like RNA Binding Proteins Cell. 2018; 174 :688-699.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ) for details about the stretched exponential growth model).
Dynamic light scattering of 5 μM GFP-G3BP was measured at 25°C with a Zetasizer Nano ZSP (Malvern) using 173° forward scattering. Measurements were recorded with a precision quartz cuvette (Hellma) recording ten 10 s autocorrelations. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Hydrodynamic radius and apparent molecular weight estimates were analyzed with the manufacturer software. Typically, GFP-G3BP was tested in 20 mM PIPES/KOH pH 7.5 and 85 mM KCl. When indicated, pH and KCl concentration were modified.
Molecular weight determination of GFP-G3BP1 and variants was performed using the Viscotek GPC max system and TDA 305 triple detector array (Malvern) in-line with a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare), at a protein concentration of 15 μM, in 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl and 0.5 mM DTT buffer. When specified, A(60) RNA was added at the indicated concentration. Data collected by the refractive index detector and the static light scattering monitor (90- and 7-degree angles) were analyzed with OmniSec software (Malvern), using bovine serum albumin as standard.
GFP-labeled G3BP1 WT and variants were diluted from stock solutions to a final concentration of 50 nM in 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT. The protein samples were filtered using centrifugal filter units with a 100 nm cut off size (Ultrafree -MC-VV, Durapore PVDF 0.1 μm, Merck Millipore). 200 μl were placed into 96-well glass bottom dishes (Greiner bio-one) and fluorescence correlation spectra were recorded at a depth of 20 μm into the sample, with respect to the glass surface. G3BP1-RNA condensates were formed from SNAP-tagged G3BP1, as described in the methods section “ Formation of G3BP1 condensates ”, yet the filtration of the suspension was omitted. Droplets were spiked with 15 nM GFP-labeled G3BP1 in the presence or absence of 3 μM unlabelled Ubc9WT and Ubc9ts, respectively. Diffusion of Cy3-labeled Ubc9 was measured at 500 nM in the presence and absence of G3BP1 droplets. Fluorescence correlation was recorded in the mid-plane of the droplet. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was carried out with a 60X 1.2NA water immersion objective (Olympus) mounted onto an Abberior Instruments confocal microscope. GFP was excited with a 490 nm, 40 mHz pulsed laser using 10 μW in the back focal plane. Photon traces were recorded for 20 s with 600 ns resolution directly using the Abberior FPGA and correlated using a multiple-tau correlator in MATLAB. The correlation data were fitted assuming 3D diffusion with a single triplet component in MATLAB. Single point fluorescence correlations were recorded for diffuse samples. Circle scanning FCS ( Maraspini et al., 2018 71. Maraspini, R. ∙ Beutel, O. ∙ Honigmann, A. Circle scanning STED fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to quantify membrane dynamics and compartmentalization Methods. 2018; 140-141 :188-197 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to determine G3BP1 and Ubc9 mobility inside droplets. We scanned circular trajectories with a diameter of 3 μm and frequency of 3 kHz through the midplane of droplets. Each pixel of the trajectory was auto-correlated in time and fitted assuming single component 3D diffusion using MATLAB.
A(60) RNA was 3′ labeled with pCp-Cy5 (Jena Bioscience), using T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. Following ligation, unincorporated pCp-Cy5 were removed with Illustra MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). The resulting A(60)-Cy5 RNA was quantified and used to assess G3BP1 RNA-binding affinity by EMSA, using the following conditions: 20 mM PIPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 85 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 6% Glycerol, 10 μg/ml BSA, 8 μg/ml rRNA, 200 nM A(60)-Cy5, 0.5-4 μM GFP-G3BP1 (WT or mutants). When specified, 300 ng of unlabeled competitor RNA (A(60) or poly(A)) or 1 μM mCherry-Caprin-1 were added. RNA binding reactions (15 μl) were incubated for 1 hr at RT. 10 μl of sample were resolved in Novex TBE 4%–20% gels (Thermo Fisher) and visualized with Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). EMSA quantification was carried out with the FIJI software and the data were analyzed and plotted with the RStudio software package.
Dephosphorylation of GFP-G3BP1 was performed with Lambda Protein Phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 2 hr at RT, following manufacturer’s indications. Typically, 1.6 nmol of GFP-G3BP1 and 800 U of Lambda Protein Phosphatase were used. After the reaction, the buffer was exchanged with Pierce™ Polyacrylamide Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Fisher) to 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT. The efficiency of dephosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-pS149-G3BP1 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, 1:1000 dilution).
RNA tangles of poly(G) RNA were formed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 and 5% PEG ( Jain and Vale, 2017; Van Treeck et al., 2018 46. Jain, A. ∙ Vale, R.D.

RNA self-assembly contributes to stress granule formation and defining the stress granule transcriptome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :2734-2739 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, poly(G) RNA was heated for 5 min at 75°C and immediately cooled in ice. The denatured RNA was then premixed with GFP-G3BP1 (WT or variants) and added to the final buffer at a final concentration of 200 ng/ul of RNA and 7.5 μM of protein. poly(G) RNA was stained with 50 μM of F22 dye when indicated ( Li and Chang, 2006 63. Li, Q. ∙ Chang, Y.-T. A protocol for preparing, characterizing and using three RNA-specific, live cell imaging probes: E36, E144 and F22 Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2922-2932 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples were directly prepared in 384-well plates (Greiner bio-one) and immediately imaged. Alternatively, samples were placed onto PEG-passivated coverslips for coalescence experiments with a dual-trap optical tweezer.
Condensates formed from 5 μM GFP-G3BP1(WT) with 50 ng/μl polyA RNA were prepared as described above and mounted between PEG-passivated glass slides ( Alberti et al., 2018 5. Alberti, S. ∙ Saha, S. ∙ Woodruff, J.B. ... A user’s guide for phase separation assays with purified proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :4806-4820 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), with double-sided 50 μm thick sticky tape as spacer. Three-dimensional (3D) refractive index (RI) distribution of samples were measured with a slightly adjusted custom-built optical diffraction tomography microscope as described in Abuhattum et al. (2018) 1. Abuhattum, S. ∙ Kim, K. ∙ Franzmann, T.M. ... Intracellular Mass Density Increase Is Accompanying but Not Sufficient for Stiffening and Growth Arrest of Yeast Cells Front. Phys. 2018; 6 :131 Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar . The complex optical fields of light scattered by the samples were retrieved from the recorded holograms by applying a Fourier transform-based field retrieval algorithm as previously published ( Cuche et al., 2000; Takeda et al., 1982 21. Cuche, E. ∙ Marquet, P. ∙ Depeursinge, C. Spatial filtering for zero-order and twin-image elimination in digital off-axis holography Appl.

Fourier-transform method of fringe-pattern analysis for computer-based topography and interferometry. J. Opt. Soc. Am JOSA. 1982; 72 :156-160 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). The 3D RI tomogram was reconstructed from retrieved complex optical fields according to Fourier diffraction theorem. A more detailed description of tomogram reconstruction can be found elsewhere ( Kim et al., 2014; Sung et al., 2009; Wolf, 1969 58. Kim, K. ∙ Yoon, H. ∙ Diez-Silva, M. ...

Commun. 1969; 1 :153-156 Crossref Google Scholar ). Segmentation and determination of the mean RI values of the condensates (RI condensate ) was with FIJI. The refractive index is directly proportional to the change in mass concentration across a phase boundary. The mass concentration was calculated using the mean RI condensate value, the RI value of the buffer (RI buffer = 1.336 at λ = 532 nm) and the RI increment (dn/dc) for protein and RNA (dn/dc = 0.185 mL/g) ( Zhao et al., 2011 122.

5 μM GFP-G3BP1 with 50 ng/μl polyA RNA were incubated on glass cover slide for 30 s. Glutaraldehyde was added to yield a final concentration of 0.05% and incubated for 30 s. 4 μL of the droplet suspension was deposited onto 45 s glow-discharged holey SiO 2 -coated 200 mesh copper R 2/2 grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools, Jena, Germany). Grids were blotted from both sides for 2 s with blot force 0, followed by drain time of 2 s and immediately plunged into liquid ethane at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Vitrobot Mark 4 (FEI Company, Eindhoven, Netherlands) set to 22°C, 90% humidity. The frozen grids were stored in sealed boxes in liquid nitrogen until further processing. Cryo-electron tomography data were collected on a Titan Krios microscope operated at 300 kV (ThermoFisher Scientific, Eindhoven, Netherlands) equipped with a field-emission gun, a Quantum post-column energy filter (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA), a K3 direct detector camera (Gatan) and a Volta phase plate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Eindhoven, Netherlands). Data were recorded in dose-fractionation mode using acquisition procedures in SerialEM software v3.7.2 ( Mastronarde, 2005 74. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to the acquisition of tilt-series, montages of the grid squares were acquired at ∼7.8 nm/pixel. Tilt-series were collected using a dose symmetric scheme ( Hagen et al., 2017 36. Hagen, W.J.H. ∙ Wan, W. ∙ Briggs, J.A.G. Implementation of a cryo-electron tomography tilt-scheme optimized for high resolution subtomogram averaging. J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :191-198 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a Volta phase plate ( Danev et al., 2014 23. Danev, R. ∙ Buijsse, B. ∙ Khoshouei, M. ... Volta potential phase plate for in-focus phase contrast transmission electron microscopy Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014; 111 :15635-15640 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ) in nano-probe mode, pixel size at the specimen level of 2.075 Å, 3 μm defocus, tilt increment 2° with constant dose of 2.2 e−/Å2 for all tilts. Prior to tilt-series alignment and tomographic reconstructions in the IMOD software package, version 4.9.4 ( Kremer et al., 1996 60. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD Journal of Structural Biology. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (2688) PubMed Google Scholar ), the projection movies were corrected for beam induced drift in the SerialEM plugin. Alignment of tilt-series images was performed with patch-tracking. Final alignment of the tilt-series images was performed using the linear interpolation option in IMOD without contrast transfer function correction. Aligned images were binned to the final pixel size of 8.3 Å. For tomographic reconstruction by back-projection, the radial filter options were left at their default values (cut off, 0.35; fall off, 0.05). The reconstructed volume was filtered with a Gaussian filter of 3 pixels radius.
All-atom Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the CAMPARI simulation engine ( http://campari.sourceforge.net/ ) using the ABSINTH implicit solvent model and forcefield paradigm implemented in the abs_opls3.2.prm parameter set ( Vitalis and Pappu, 2009a 112. Vitalis, A. ∙ Pappu, R.V. ABSINTH: a new continuum solvation model for simulations of polypeptides in aqueous solutions J. Comput. Chem. 2009; 30 :673-699 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ABINSTH model and simulation tools implemented in CAMPARI have been used extensively for the simulation of intrinsically disordered proteins and disordered regions tethered to folded domains ( Das et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2016; Mittal et al., 2018 24. Das, R.K. ∙ Huang, Y. ∙ Phillips, A.H. ... Cryptic sequence features within the disordered protein p27Kip1 regulate cell cycle signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :5616-5621 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 73. Martin, E.W. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Grace, C.R. ... Sequence Determinants of the Conformational Properties of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein Prior to and Upon Multisite Phosphorylation J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 :15323-15335 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 80. Mittal, A. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Cohan, M.C. ... Sequence-to-Conformation Relationships of Disordered Regions Tethered to Folded Domains of Proteins J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :2403-2421 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). For all simulations, the backbone dihedral angles for residues within the folded domains were held fixed. All other degrees of freedom (including sidechain dihedral angles within the folded domains as well as backbone and sidechain dihedral angles within disordered segments) were allowed to vary in the simulations.
We constructed a de novo all-atom model of monomeric and dimeric G3BP1 to ensure that the coordinates are interoperable with the bond lengths and bond angles of the ABSINTH forcefield. The crystal structure of monomeric NTF2 (PDB: 4IIA ) was used as a starting structure of the NTF2 domain ( Vognsen et al., 2013 114. Vognsen, T. ∙ Møller, I.R. ∙ Kristensen, O. Crystal structures of the human G3BP1 NTF2-like domain visualize FxFG Nup repeat specificity PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e80947 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). The starting configurations for the acidic domain, PxxP domain and RG-rich region were all extracted at random from ensembles of self-avoiding conformations. A structural model for the folded RRM within G3BP1 is unavailable. Accordingly, we leveraged the significant sequence homology to many RRMs from the hnRNP class of proteins. In particular, the first RRM from hnRNPD0 shows strong sequence homology and a structural model (PDB: 1HD1 ) has been generated using data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ( Figure S5 A; Nagata et al., 1999 84. Nagata, T. ∙ Kurihara, Y. ∙ Matsuda, G. ... Structure and interactions with RNA of the N-terminal UUAG-specific RNA-binding domain of hnRNP Do J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287 :221-237 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used this structural model to generate a homology model using the G3BP1 RRM sequence and hnRNPAD0 RRM-1 structure, yielding a model with 99% confidence ( Kelley et al., 2015 54. Kelley, L.A. ∙ Mezulis, S. ∙ Yates, C.M. ... The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :845-858 Crossref Scopus (3509) PubMed Google Scholar ). The five distinct components (NTF2, acidic domain, PxxP domain, RRM and RG-rich region) were assembled together into a single full-length monomer structure. To generate “mutant” constructs, regions were omitted from the starting structure – i.e., for the ΔNTF2 the NTF2 domain was removed from the monomeric G3BP1 construct. Figure 5 A shows a single simulation snapshot of the dimeric structure. To generate a model for the G3BP1 dimer, we aligned our full-length monomeric G3BP1 using the model for the dimer from PDB: 4FCJ to define the NTF2 dimer interface. The relative position of the two NTF2 domains was then held fixed during simulations. We performed two distinct types of all-atom Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations ( Vitalis and Pappu, 2009b 113. Vitalis, A. ∙ Pappu, R.V. Methods for Monte Carlo simulations of biomacromolecules Annu. Rep. Comput. Chem. 2009; 5 :49-76 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to assess the robustness of our conclusions, multiple independent simulations starting from different configurations are run.
Simulations using the full ABSINTH Hamiltonian describe atomistic interactions using a complete description of different types of interactions (electrostatics, Van der Waals, solvation effects, etc.). The computational cost needed to compute these interactions is significant, and these simulations take on the order of weeks-to-months to complete for the sized systems examined here.
For simulations performed using the excluded volume (EV) Hamiltonian electrostatics, solvation effects, and attractive Lennard-Jones interactions are turned off such that while the folded domains remain fixed the IDRs behave as self-avoiding random-coil polymers. These simulations take on the order of hours-to-days to complete for the sized systems examined here.
Simulations were analyzed using the CTraj analysis suite ( https://camparitraj.readthedocs.io ) built on the MDTraj backend ( McGibbon et al., 2015 78. McGibbon, R.T. ∙ Beauchamp, K.A. ∙ Harrigan, M.P. ... MDTraj: A Modern Open Library for the Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories Biophys. J. 2015; 109 :1528-1532 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ensemble-average hydrodynamic radius (R H ) was calculated using the HullRad package ( http://52.14.70.9/ ; Fleming and Fleming, 2018 30. Fleming, P.J. ∙ Fleming, K.G. HullRad: Fast Calculations of Folded and Disordered Protein and Nucleic Acid Hydrodynamic Properties Biophys. J. 2018; 114 :856-869 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The inter-domain distance between the acidic domain and the RG-rich region was calculated using the point-to-point center of mass distance between the two regions. Specifically, for each simulation frame the center of mass associated with all the residues in each of the two domains in question was first calculated, and the distance between those two points was determined.
The normalized distance map ( Figure 5 B) was calculated by first determining the ensemble-average distance between the Cα atom of every pair of residues. Each distance was then normalized by the expected distance for a sequence-matched polypeptide behaving as a Gaussian chain (given the intrinsic dimensions of the peptide unit)
Ultra-coarse-grained simulations were performed using Monte Carlo simulations performed over a simple lattice model in a manner analogous to as has been described previously ( Boeynaems et al., 2018; Fei et al., 2017; Feric et al., 2016; Harmon et al., 2017a 11.

The molecular evolution of the system is driven by a variety of Monte Carlo moves that include chain pivot/re-arrangement moves and molecular translation/rotation moves of both individual molecules and clusters of molecules. The intrinsically simple nature of our model allows rapid convergence of simulations.
Bead-bead interactions extend only between nearest neighbor components. As described in Figure 6 A, G3BP1 molecules consist of two beads (an N-terminal bead, NTB and C-terminal bead, CTB) while RNA is a polymer of either 6 (∼50-60 nt RNA) or 100 (∼800-1000 nt RNA) RNA beads (RBs). Interaction strengths between beads are as follows: Bead 1 Bead 2 Strength (kT) Comment NTB NTB +0.2 We assume no attractive interactions between the N-terminal half of the dimer. NTB CTB −0.6 Weakly attractive interaction between the C- and N-terminal halves of the dimer (i.e., RG-acidic IDR interaction) NTB RB +0.4 We assume no attractive interactions between the N-terminal half of the dimer and RNA CTB CTB −0.8 Weakly attractive interaction between the C-terminal parts of the dimmer (i.e., RG-RG interaction) CTB RB −4.0 Strong attraction between the C-terminal parts of the dimer and RNA (i.e., RRM-RNA interaction) RB RB +10.0 Strong repulsion between RNA beads (RNA does not intrinsically want to self-associate) Open table in a new tab
The conclusions from our model are relatively insensitive to the specific parameters chosen here. The key aspects of the interaction model that are required to observe clustering on RNA are strongly attractive CTB-RNA interaction, weakly attractive CTB-CTB interaction, weakly repulsive NTB-NTB interactions, and strongly repulsive RNA-RNA interactions.
We wish to emphasize unequivocally that this model is not capturing anything unique regarding G3BP1/2 interaction with RNA, but instead describing an entire class of systems in which a small molecular species (G3BP1) has a high affinity for a polymer (RNA) and engages in weakly multivalent and attractive interactions with itself. With this in mind, we see no reason to expect the formation of microclusters in an RNA-dependent manner to be unique to G3BP1, nor indeed to RNA (or even nucleic-acid) binding.
In the ΔRG version ( Figure 6 B) the only change to our model is (1) no attractive CTB-CTB interaction and (2) no attractive CTB-NTB interaction. We did not alter the strength of CTB-RNA interaction.
Simulations were performed in a cubic box of [100 × 100 × 100]. The total number of Monte Carlo steps performed per simulation varies but is typically on the order of 1-3 x10 9 .
Sequence conservation was calculated by computing the global alignment across 339 orthologous G3BP1/2 sequences identified using the EggNog server ( Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016 44. Huerta-Cepas, J. ∙ Szklarczyk, D. ∙ Forslund, K. ... eggNOG 4.5: a hierarchical orthology framework with improved functional annotations for eukaryotic, prokaryotic and viral sequences Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D286-D293 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignment was performed using Clustal Omega, and conservation determined using the default analysis for conservation in JalView ( Madeira et al., 2019 69. Madeira, F. ∙ Park, Y.M. ∙ Lee, J. ... The EMBL-EBI search and sequence analysis tools APIs in 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W636-W641 Crossref Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ). The net charge per residue is calculated using the localCIDER analysis package ( Holehouse et al., 2017 42. Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Das, R.K. ∙ Ahad, J.N. ...

FIJI ( Schindelin et al., 2012 99. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (16263) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in-house written macro ( Data S1 ) were used for segmenting SGs. First, image sequences were normalized using a reference image sequence such that minimum and maximum intensities among different experiments were comparable for analysis. The normalized image series was then rescaled for photobleaching correction using the 5 th and 95 th percentile of the gray-level histogram. SGs were then segmented using watershed methods ( Lotufo and Falcao, 2000; Vincent and Soille, 1991 67. Lotufo, R. ∙ Falcao, A. The ordered queue and the optimality of the watershed approaches Goutsias, J. ∙ Vincent, L. ∙ Bloomberg, D.S.

Intell. 1991; 13 :583-598 Crossref Scopus (4050) Google Scholar ; https://imagej.net/Interactive_Watershed ). Objects were segmented, maximum was determined and Watershadding was applied with 25%–100% from spot max. Objects smaller than 200 nm in diameter were rejected. The number, size, and mean intensity of SGs were measured in the segmented regions. Data analysis and plotting was with R/RStudio.
Images were analyzed with custom semi-automated workflows in Fiji, except for automated high content imaging of fixed cells, where a custom pipeline in CellProfiler was used (see next section). In short: for threshold-based segmentation of cells and condensates, the image was illumination corrected by normalizing the image to its own blurred image using a Gaussian blur with 50 pixels. Objects with intensities larger than 5% of the mean intensity of the normalized image were thresholded and selected. The selection was applied to the original image for measurement. Segmentations were manually spot checked by eye and then applied for the entire dataset. Calculation of the apparent phase separated fraction was with (I Condensate ∗ A Condensate / (I Total ∗ A Total ) where I Condensate is the mean condensate fluorescence intensity, A Condensate the condensate area, I Total the mean fluorescence intensity of the image and A Total the size of the image. For binary analysis, an area covered with condensates larger 1% and smaller 90% was considered phase separated. Data analysis and plotting was with the R/RStudio software package.
Image analysis was carried out with the open source software CellProfiler. First, nuclei were segmented with Otsu and fused objects split with a watershed algorithm. The surrounding cytoplasm was detected with a propagation algorithm. Next, SGs were segmented using a white top hat filter to enhance structures and the Otsu with a watershed to detect individual SGs. Intensity and shape parameters were then extracted from the segmented images. Statistical analysis was carried out with the open source software KNIME.
Quantification and statistical analysis were performed using R/Rstudio. p values were calculated and plotted with the R ggsignif package. Significance levels: ∗ < 0.05, ∗∗ < 0.01, ∗∗∗ < 0.001. Boxplots: horizontal line depicts the median, the box is the 25 and 75 percentile and the whiskers denote the min. and max. values considered for analysis. Further statistical details can be found in the figure legends and STAR Methods .
The onsets of condensate assembly (in cells and in vitro ) were estimated by non-least square fitting of the data to the general equation y ⁡ ( x ) = A ⁢ 2 + ( ( A ⁢ 1 − A ⁢ 2 ) ( 1 + e ⁢ ( x − x ⁢ 0 ) d ⁢ x ) ) ) , where y is the measured signal at the given control value x, A1 is the lower and A2 the upper plateau baseline, x0 the x axis value of the inflection point of the sigmoid and dx the slope within the inflection point. The Onset was estimated by regression with O ⁢ n ⁢ s ⁢ e ⁢ t = A ⁢ 1 ( ( A ⁢ 2 − A ⁢ 1 ) ( 4 ∗ d ⁢ x ) ) − ( A ⁢ 1 + A ⁢ 2 ) ( 2 ∗ ( ( A ⁢ 2 − A ⁢ 1 ) ( 4 ∗ d ⁢ x ) ) ) + x ⁢ 0 For apparent cellular saturation concentration estimates, cells with four and more condensates were scored positive for SGs and assigned the value 1. The datasets per variant was binned based on the mean fluorescence intensity and median was formed. Iterative datasets were formed with bin sizes 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75 and 100. Medians were plotted as a function of the mean fluorescence intensity of the bin and fitted as described above.
Analysis of FRAP measurements was with the FIJI software, in which the selected condensate was drift corrected using the rigid body method of the StackReg module ( Thévenaz et al., 1998 106. Thévenaz, P. ∙ Ruttimann, U.E. ∙ Unser, M. A pyramid approach to subpixel registration based on intensity IEEE Trans. Image Process. 1998; 7 :27-41 Crossref Scopus (1635) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by calculating the normalized condensate intensity by normalizing the fluorescence intensity of the bleach region (I FRAP ) by the starting fluorescence (I FRAPt0 ) and the total condensate fluorescence intensity (I total ) normalized by the start fluorescence (I totalt0 ) of the condensate.

To this end, FRAP data for each condition were averaged and the standard deviation was calculated from the mean of the normalized intensity data. The recovery was fitted by non-least square analysis, fitting the mean fluorescence data as a function of time to the single or double exponential equations 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑧 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑦 0 + 𝐴 ⋅ 𝑒 − 𝑘 ∗ 𝑡 a n d 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑧 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑦 0 + 𝐴 1 ⋅ 𝑒 − 𝑘 1 ∗ 𝑡 + 𝐴 2 ⋅ 𝑒 − 𝑘 2 ∗ 𝑡 , where y 0 is the recovery plateau, A, as well as A 1 and A 2 , respectively, the amplitude of the fluorescence change and k, as well as k 1 and k 2 , respectively, the apparent recovery rates. The half-life (t 1/2 ) of the reaction was calculated from the equation 𝑡 1 2 = 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 2 ) 𝑘 and the mobile and immobile fractions were calculated from the equations 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 = − 𝐴 1 − ( 𝑦 0 + 𝐴 ) a n d 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 = 1 − 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛
Analysis of the RNA binding isotherms was carried out by non-least square fitting of the fraction RNA bound (F) as a function of the protein concentration (P) to a cooperative Hill binding model F = P ∧ ⁢ n ( K ⁢ D ∧ ⁢ n + P ∧ ⁢ n ) , in which KD is the apparent affinity and n the cooperativity term of the binding reaction.
