Title: Parkinson’s disease-risk protein TMEM175 is a proton-activated proton channel in lysosomes


Abstract: Summary

Lysosomes require an acidic lumen between pH 4.5 and 5.0 for effective digestion of macromolecules. This pH optimum is maintained by proton influx produced by the V-ATPase and efflux through an unidentified “H + leak” pathway. Here we show that TMEM175 , a genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD), mediates the lysosomal H + leak by acting as a proton-activated, proton-selective channel on the lysosomal membrane (LyPAP). Acidification beyond the normal range potently activated LyPAP to terminate further acidification of lysosomes. An endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid and synthetic agonists also activated TMEM175 to trigger lysosomal proton release. TMEM175 deficiency caused lysosomal over-acidification, impaired proteolytic activity, and facilitated α-synuclein aggregation in vivo . Mutational and pH normalization analyses indicated that the channel’s H + conductance is essential for normal lysosome function. Thus, modulation of LyPAP by cellular cues may dynamically tune the pH optima of endosomes and lysosomes to regulate lysosomal degradation and PD pathology.

Section: Introduction

Intracellular endosomes and lysosomes require a vacuolar-type H + ATPase (V-ATPase) to establish a 50- to 5,000-fold proton concentration gradient across their membranes ( Mindell, 2012 50. Mindell, J.A. Lysosomal acidification mechanisms Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74 :69-86 Crossref Scopus (885) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ohkuma et al., 1982 54. Ohkuma, S. ∙ Moriyama, Y. ∙ Takano, T.

A. 1982; 79 :2758-2762 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). This proton gradient can be utilized to drive the active transport of ions and metabolites between the vesicular lumen and the cytosol, and an acidic lumen (pH 4.5–5.0) is required for the optimal activities of most hydrolytic enzymes in the lysosome ( Kalatzis et al., 2001 35.

Abnormal lysosomal pH impairs lysosomal degradation, cargo loading, catabolite export, vesicle movement, and nutrient sensing ( Ballabio and Bonifacino, 2019 3. Ballabio, A. ∙ Bonifacino, J.S.

Because lysosomal pH normalization (optimization) was shown to effectively remove toxic protein aggregates in these neurodegenerative diseases, lysosomal pH homeostasis likely plays a pivotal role in lysosome function, cellular health, and neuropathology ( Bonam et al., 2019 5.

Lysosomal pH is heterogeneous, and the “steady-state” set-point pH for individual lysosomes is determined by the dynamic equilibrium between proton influx and efflux across the lysosomal membranes ( Ishida et al., 2013 29. Ishida, Y. ∙ Nayak, S. ∙ Mindell, J.A. ... A model of lysosomal pH regulation J. Gen. Physiol. 2013; 141 :705-720 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Johnson et al., 2016 34.

Inhibition of the V-ATPase quickly leads to organelle alkalization, suggesting the presence of unidentified “H + leak” channel-mediated conductance(s) on the membranes of intracellular acidic compartments ( Christensen et al., 2002 17. Christensen, K.A. ∙ Myers, J.T. ∙ Swanson, J.A. pH-dependent regulation of lysosomal calcium in macrophages J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 :599-607 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2019 44.

Physiol. 2015; 77 :57-80 Crossref Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to maintain a steady-state lysosomal pH at the set-point pH, a small H + leak (roughly estimated to be 10 4 –10 5 ions/sec or 0.1–1 pA across lysosomal membranes) is required to offset the proton influx produced by the V-ATPase ( Johnson et al., 2016 34.

Two families of mammalian proton-selective channels have been identified: Otopetrins (OTOP1-3) and the voltage-gated proton channel (H V 1), but their normal location is the plasma membrane of specific cell types ( Ramsey et al., 2006 59.

Here we report that TMEM175, a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal membrane protein ( Cang et al., 2015 10. Cang, C. ∙ Aranda, K. ∙ Seo, Y.-j. ... TMEM175 is an organelle K+ channel regulating lysosomal function Cell. 2015; 162 :1101-1112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), is highly and selectively permeable to protons when its luminal face is exposed to the acidic pH found within lysosomes, mediating the lysosomal H + leak that balances V-ATPase activity to maintain lysosome pH homeostasis. TMEM175 was previously reported to be a “K + leak” channel in lysosomes ( Brunner et al., 2020 9. Brunner, J.D. ∙ Jakob, R.P. ∙ Schulze, T. ...

Lee, C. ∙ Guo, J. ∙ Zeng, W. ... The lysosomal potassium channel TMEM175 adopts a novel tetrameric architecture Nature. 2017; 547 :472-475 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oh et al., 2020 53. Oh, S. ∙ Paknejad, N. ∙ Hite, R.K. Gating and selectivity mechanisms for the lysosomal K(+) channel TMEM175 Elife. 2020; 9 :e53430 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, those studies were conducted with luminal-side pH above 7.0, which is non-physiological for lysosomal channels ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu and Ren, 2015 79. Xu, H. ∙ Ren, D. Lysosomal physiology Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77 :57-80 Crossref Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under the normal lysosomal pH (4.5–5.0), we found that TMEM175 is approximately 10 5 times more permeable to protons than to potassium or sodium and that in native lysosomes under conditions normally found in lysosomes, >90% of the ion flow through TMEM175 is mediated by protons. Furthermore, lysosomal TMEM175 could be activated by an endogenous lipid and two synthetic chemicals. Thus, rather than being a constitutively active potassium-selective channel, lysosomal TMEM175 is a proton- or lipid-gated, proton-selective channel under lysosomal physiological condition.

Section: Results

To study lysosomal proton flux mechanisms, we performed patch-clamp recordings ( Figure 1 A) on late endosomes and lysosomes (LELs) chemically enlarged by vacuolin-1 and manually isolated from various types of mammalian cells ( Chen et al., 2017b 14. Chen, C.C. ∙ Cang, C. ∙ Fenske, S. ... Patch-clamp technique to characterize ion channels in enlarged individual endolysosomes Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1639-1658 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dong et al., 2008 23. Dong, X.P. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Mills, E. ... The type IV mucolipidosis-associated protein TRPML1 is an endolysosomal iron release channel Nature. 2008; 455 :992-996 Crossref Scopus (451) PubMed Google Scholar ). To facilitate the detection of proton currents, the large ions N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG + ) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA − ) were used to replace the normal physiological cations and anions (Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , and Cl − ) in both pipette/luminal and bath/cytosolic solutions, and a proton gradient between the cytosolic and luminal sides was established using appropriate pH buffers. When luminal pH (pH L ) was set to 4.6 with a cytosolic pH (pH C ) of 7.2, detectable (>5 pA at −120 mV, V m = V Cytosol - V Lumen ) inward “leak-like” currents were found in a small portion (31 out of 128) of the enlarged LELs and the currents reversed at above +80 mV ( Figures S1 A and S1B). When pH L was lowered to 3.5, all LELs (7 out of 7) showed large (>100 pA at −120 mV) inward currents ( Figures 1 B and 1C). When both sides were equally acidic (pH L /pH C of 4.6/4.6 or 3.5/3.5), significant currents were seen in both the inward and outward directions, and the reversal potential (E rev ) shifted to near 0 mV ( Figures 1 B and S1 A), as would be expected for a proton-selective channel. No measurable current was seen at all potentials when pH L and pH C were both set to 7.2 ( Figures S1 C and 1 C). Similar pH-dependent currents were seen regardless of the major cation (NMDG + , TMA + , Choline + , K + , Na + , Ca 2+ , or Mg 2+ ) or anion (MSA − or Cl − ) present in the luminal and cytosolic sides of recording solutions (see Figure S1 D for a current trace with Na + as the major cation). Hereafter, we refer to the channel carrying this H + -dependent leak current as the lysosomal, proton-activated, proton-permeant channel (LyPAP). LyPAP currents ( I LyPAP ) were present in all cell types that we investigated: COS1, HAP1, HEK293T, HeLa, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and mouse hippocampal neurons ( Figure S1 E). Similar—albeit smaller—currents were also observed in early endosomes ( Figure S1 F). Thus, LyPAP is a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal proton channel with its activity beginning to be detectable at a pH L of 4.6, the typical lower edge of the optimal pH range for lysosomes (i.e., set-point pH) ( Forgac, 2007 24.

Mindell, J.A. Lysosomal acidification mechanisms Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74 :69-86 Crossref Scopus (885) PubMed Google Scholar ), but increasing dramatically when pH L is further lowered.
To search for the molecular identity of the LyPAP, we performed an expression screen with the candidate library consisting of a list of putative channel/transporter-like lysosomal membrane proteins based on proteomic studies ( Schroder et al., 2010 66. Schröder, B.A. ∙ Wrocklage, C. ∙ Hasilik, A. ... The proteome of lysosomes Proteomics. 2010; 10 :4053-4076 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wyant et al., 2018 77.

To make recognizing a positive hit easier, the screening was conducted in COS1 cells with pH L set to 4.6, which only allows very small endogenous I LyPAP ( Figure 1 C). The only positive hit was TMEM175, for which the average current amplitude at −120 mV was more than 20 times larger than those from control (un-transfected) cells, cells transfected with the other candidates, or cells transfected with known lysosomal channels (e.g., TRPML1 or TPC1) that were previously suggested to be proton permeable ( Pitt et al., 2014 56. Pitt, S.J. ∙ Lam, A.K.M. ∙ Rietdorf, K. ... Reconstituted human TPC1 is a proton-permeable ion channel and is activated by NAADP or Ca2+ Sci.

TRP-ML1 regulates lysosomal pH and acidic lysosomal lipid hydrolytic activity J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :7294-7301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 D, 1E, S1 G, and S1H). Like endogenous I LyPAP , E rev of the whole-LEL currents from TMEM175-transfected cells shifted from > +80 mV to 0 mV when pH C was changed from 7.2 to 4.6 (equaling pH L ; Figure 1 E).
In TMEM175 knockout (KO) HAP1, HeLa, and HEK293T cells ( Figure S2 A) that were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 ( Ran et al., 2013 60. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ), whole-LEL I LyPAP was absent even with a pH L of 3.5 but was reliably observed in unmodified wild-type (WT) cells or from KO cells re-expressing human TMEM175 (hTMEM175, Figures 1 F and 1G). In contrast, I LyPAP was intact in TPC1/TPC2 double knockout (DKO) HAP1 cells or TRPML1 KO human fibroblasts ( Shen et al., 2012 68. Shen, D. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Li, X. ... Lipid storage disorders block lysosomal trafficking by inhibiting a TRP channel and lysosomal calcium release Nat. Commun. 2012; 3 :731 Crossref Scopus (376) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2019b 86. Zhang, X. ∙ Chen, W. ∙ Li, P. ... Agonist-specific voltage-dependent gating of lysosomal two-pore Na(+) channels Elife. 2019; 8 :e51423 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Thus, TMEM175 is both necessary and sufficient for I LyPAP in endolysosomes.
Consistent with previous reports ( Cang et al., 2015 10. Cang, C. ∙ Aranda, K. ∙ Seo, Y.-j. ... TMEM175 is an organelle K+ channel regulating lysosomal function Cell. 2015; 162 :1101-1112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jinn et al., 2019 32. Jinn, S. ∙ Blauwendraat, C. ∙ Toolan, D. ... Functionalization of the TMEM175 p.M393T variant as a risk factor for Parkinson disease Hum. Mol. Genet. 2019; 28 :3244-3254 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), fluorescently tagged EGFP-TMEM175 puncta exhibited extensive co-localization with a marker for LELs (LAMP1), partial co-localization with a marker for early endosomes (EEA1), but no co-localization with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker green ( Figure S2 D). A suitable antibody for immunodetection of endogenous TMEM175 proteins was unavailable, so we generated hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TMEM175 knockin (KI) HAP1 cells ( Figure S2 E); in these cells, most HA-positive puncta were observed to overlap with LAMP1 ( Figure 1 H).
We found that in TMEM175-transfected HEK293T cells, large whole-cell currents ( I TMEM175 ) were evoked by acidic extracellular pH (pH E/L ); such currents were never observed in the vector-transfected (sham) cells ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Hence, overexpressed, but not endogenous, TMEM175 can traffic to the plasma membrane, as reported for some other lysosomal channels in heterologous overexpression systems ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu and Ren, 2015 79. Xu, H. ∙ Ren, D. Lysosomal physiology Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77 :57-80 Crossref Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extracellular face of TMEM175 present on the plasma membrane is topologically equivalent to its luminal face in LEL membranes ( Lee et al., 2017 41. Lee, C. ∙ Guo, J. ∙ Zeng, W. ... The lysosomal potassium channel TMEM175 adopts a novel tetrameric architecture Nature. 2017; 547 :472-475 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore studied the pH dependence of I TMEM175 using whole-cell recordings in which the pH E/L can be easily switched with a perfusion system to mimic changes in the pH L of endolysosomes. When pH C was set to 7.2 with NMDG + as the only major cation in the recording solutions, the current amplitude at −120 mV of whole-cell I TMEM175 increased dramatically upon reducing pH E/L ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Similar pH L -dependence was observed in lumen-side-out lysosomal recordings ( Figures S3 B and S3C), validating the characterization of heterologously overexpressed TMEM175 using whole-cell recordings. The estimated macroscopic conductance of both human and mouse TMEM175 increased drastically as the extracellular/luminal side [H + ] became greater ( Figures S3 A, S3C and S3D), suggestive of an activation effect of pH E/L .
To assess the selectivity of TMEM175 channels for protons, we set pH C to 5.0 (to make the outward current much larger than that at pH C 7.2) and measured E rev as a function of the proton gradient (ΔpH = pH E/L - pH C ). With either NMDG + , Na + , or K + as the major cation, the change in E rev closely followed the Nernst equation for a proton-selective channel with a linear fit of −53 mV/ΔpH unit ( Figures 2 D–2H). TMEM175 was previously reported to be a K + -selective channel ( Cang et al., 2015 10. Cang, C. ∙ Aranda, K. ∙ Seo, Y.-j. ... TMEM175 is an organelle K+ channel regulating lysosomal function Cell. 2015; 162 :1101-1112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), but those experiments were conducted under neutral pH conditions, which are physiological for plasma membrane channels but non-physiological for endolysosomal channels ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu and Ren, 2015 79. Xu, H. ∙ Ren, D. Lysosomal physiology Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77 :57-80 Crossref Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under normal physiological conditions for endolysosomes, where the luminal side is highly acidic and the cytosolic side is neutral with a high concentration of potassium ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu and Ren, 2015 79. Xu, H. ∙ Ren, D. Lysosomal physiology Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77 :57-80 Crossref Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ), protons were much more permeable than potassium. For example, at pH E/L = 5.0, even though the cytosolic side [K + ] was 14,000 times higher than the extracellular/luminal side [H + ], the E rev was quite positive ( Figure 2 F), indicating that H + is much more permeable than K + through TMEM175. Based on E rev measurement under “bi-ionic” conditions, as well as calculations based on the ΔpH-dependent E rev shifts, we estimated the relative permeabilities to be P H /P K = 48,000 ± 2,000, P H /P Na > 200,000, and P H /P NMDG > 200,000 ( Figure 2 I), which are comparable to those of canonical proton-selective channels ( Chen et al., 2019 16.

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels Science. 2018; 359 :1047-1050 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ) (also see Figure S3 E). Consistent with a linear fit to the whole E rev -pH plot (see Figures 2 E and 2G), the proton selectivity was independent of pH E/L ( Figure S3 F).
The basal whole-cell outward K + currents in the TMEM175-transfected cells were typically too small to be reliably differentiated from the background K + currents (see STAR Methods ). However, a subset of transfected cells had outward currents (at +120 mV) far larger than ever observed in un-transfected cells, so we could attribute most of these currents to K + flow through TMEM175. In these cells, the currents at all potentials were decreased ∼50% when pH E/L was changed from 7.2 to either 6.0 or 4.6 (see Figure S3 G) as long as precautions to avoid pH buffer saturation were followed (see STAR Methods ), suggesting that K + flux through TMEM175 is suppressed at physiological pH in endolysosomes (also see ( Pergel et al., 2021 55. Pergel, E. ∙ Veres, I. ∙ Csigi, G.I. ... Translocation of TMEM175 lysosomal potassium channel to the plasma membrane by dynasore compounds Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22 :10515 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). We took two approaches: one was based on separate measurements of I H alone in K + -free solution and I K alone in K + -containing solution at neutral pH and then taking into consideration the I K inhibition by acidic pH ( Figures S3 H–S3I; also see Figures 2 B, 2F, S4 E and S4G). In the other, we derived the individual I H and I K currents from the total current ( I H + I K ) in “bi-ionic” conditions at pH 4.6 or 3.5 (see Figure 2 F). Both approaches led to the conclusion that in native lysosomes at their normal pH (4.6) and membrane potential (−110 to 0 mV) ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H.

H + flow through overexpressed TMEM175 on the plasma membrane would rapidly alter intracellular pH (pH i ) if a large inward H + gradient was present. We tested this prediction using both genetically encoded (pHluorin; see Miesenbock et al. [1998 49. Miesenböck, G. ∙ De Angelis, D.A. ∙ Rothman, J.E.

Regardless of the major cation (NMDG + , TMA + , K + , Na + , Ca 2+ , or Mg 2+ ) or anion (MSA − or Cl − ) presented in the extracellular solution, exposure to pH E/L 4.6 (with membrane-impermeable pH buffers) elicited rapid and substantial reductions in pH i in TMEM175-transfected, but not in sham, HEK293T cells ( Figures S3 K–S3P and Video S1 ).

The major ions in both solutions were TMA-MSA. The mCherry-TMEM175-positive cells and sham cells are shown side by side. Acetic acid (HOAc, pH 5.0) and NH 4 Cl (pH 7.2), freely entering the cytosol, served as positive and negative controls to acidify or alkalinize the cytosol, respectively
Arachidonic Acid (ArA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid involved in numerous cellular signaling events, reportedly increases permeability to K + and H + in isolated lysosomes ( Zhang et al., 2006 85. Zhang, G. ∙ Yi, Y.P. ∙ Zhang, G.J. Effects of arachidonic acid on the lysosomal ion permeability and osmotic stability J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2006; 38 :75-82 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). At pH L of 4.6 or 6.0 (in symmetric NMDG + ), ArA application dramatically increased the endogenous whole-LEL H + currents ( I LyPAP ) of COS1 cells ( Figures 3 A and 3B) and whole-cell H + currents of TMEM175-transfected HEK293T cells ( Figures 3 C, 3D and S4 A). Two small-molecule synthetic chemicals, DCPIB (previously known as an inhibitor of volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) [ Decher et al., 2001 21. Decher, N. ∙ Lang, H.J. ∙ Nilius, B. ... DCPIB is a novel selective blocker of I Cl, swell and prevents swelling-induced shortening of Guinea-pig atrial action potential duration Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134 :1467-1479 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ]) and ML 67-33 (previously known as an activator of K2P channels [ Bagriantsev et al., 2013 2. Bagriantsev, S.N. ∙ Ang, K.H. ∙ Gallardo-Godoy, A. ... A high-throughput functional screen identifies small molecule regulators of temperature- and mechano-sensitive K2P channels ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 :1841-1851 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ]), were also found to be potent activators of LyPAP and TMEM175-mediated H + and K + currents ( Figures 3 E–3H and S4 A–S4H). Fluorescent pHluorin assays showed that, with a pH E/L 6.0 extracellular solution, ArA or DCPIB induced substantial H + entry in TMEM175-transfected, but not sham, HEK293T cells ( Figures S4 I–S4L).
At the pH L of 4.6, large whole-LEL H + currents elicited by ArA or DCPIB were reliably observed in WT HAP1 cells but were absent in TMEM175 KO HAP1 cells ( Figures 3 I–3L). When pH C and pH E/L were both set to 7.2 to suppress H + permeation, K + or Cs + was able to generate large TMEM175-dependent whole-LEL currents, but only in the presence of ArA or DCPIB ( Figures S4 E–S4H); in most native lysosomes, lysosomal K + /Cs + leak was undetectable ( Figures S4 E and S4G; also see Figure S3 I). As the activation effect was more than 100-fold relative to the basal current, which was rarely observed in our hands ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), lysosomal TMEM175 is likely a “gated” channel, not a constitutively active leak channel as previously reported ( Cang et al., 2015 10. Cang, C. ∙ Aranda, K. ∙ Seo, Y.-j. ... TMEM175 is an organelle K+ channel regulating lysosomal function Cell. 2015; 162 :1101-1112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It was recently reported that lysosomal TMEM175 currents were stimulated by SC-79, a small-molecule AKT activator ( Wie et al., 2021 76. Wie, J. ∙ Liu, Z. ∙ Song, H. ... A growth-factor-activated lysosomal K(+) channel regulates Parkinson's pathology Nature. 2021; 591 :431-437 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in conditions that would facilitate the detection of either K + or H + currents through TMEM175 (symmetric K + and pH 6.0), no detectable increase of whole-LEL or whole-cell currents was observed in TMEM175-transfected cells even with prolonged (10 min) bath application of SC-79 (10–100 μM; Figures S5 A and S5C). In contrast, DCPIB readily evoked large H + and K + currents in the same recordings in both non-treated cells and cells that were pre-treated with AKT inhibitors (MK-2206 and ARQ-092; Figures S5 A–S5C). The efficacies of these small-molecule AKT modulators were confirmed using specific biochemical assays ( Figure S5 D). Thus, in our hands, AKT activation is neither necessary nor sufficient for TMEM175 channel activity.
The pH L dependence of the macroscopic conductance (see Figures S3 A and S3C) of TMEM175 could arise from at least two separate biophysical mechanisms: pH L -dependent activation (gating) or increase of single channel conductance (permeation). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we set pH C to 4.6 instead of the normal physiological value of 7.2 ( Figures 4 A and 4B), because this is expected to reveal large outward currents through open (activated) but not closed proton channels. Under the whole-cell configuration, with pH E/L initially set to 7.2 to establish a proton gradient of the same amplitude but in the opposite direction from the normal situation in lysosomes (shown in Figures 2 A and 2B), i.e., ΔpH = pH E/L -pH C = +2.6, there was no significant current at any potential from −120 to +120 mV ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Changing pH E/L to 4.6 (matching pH C , ΔpH = 0) elicited large H + currents in both the inward and outward directions that reversed near 0 mV ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Whereas changing pH E/L back to 7.2 slowly but completely de-activated the currents, stepping pH E/L from 4.6 to an intermediate pH (e.g., 5.6) resulted in current decreases with a concurrent leftward shift in E rev ( Figure S5 E). Similar results were obtained with lumen-side-out lysosomal recordings ( Figure S5 F). Thus, H + can only permeate the channel when there is an acidic environment facing the luminal side of TMEM175. In other words, TMEM175 is gated by luminal protons. With the reversed proton gradient (ΔpH = +2.6; pH E/L = 7.2 and pH C = 4.6), DCPIB also activated substantial TEMEM175-mediated outward currents ( Figures S5 G and S5H) with a very negative E rev (∼−120 mV) expected for a proton-selective channel. Hence, both luminal protons and non-proton agonists can activate the proton permeation pathway through TMEM175.
To identify the molecular determinants involved with pH L activation and/or H + permeability of TMEM175, we systematically mutated amino acid residues with side chains capable of H + binding (Aspartate, glutamate, or Histidine) in the pore region and luminal loops (see Figure S6 A), as revealed in the atomic-resolution structures of TMEM175 ( Brunner et al., 2020 9. Brunner, J.D. ∙ Jakob, R.P. ∙ Schulze, T. ... Structural basis for ion selectivity in TMEM175 K(+) channels Elife. 2020; 9 :e53683 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2017 41. Lee, C. ∙ Guo, J. ∙ Zeng, W. ... The lysosomal potassium channel TMEM175 adopts a novel tetrameric architecture Nature. 2017; 547 :472-475 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oh et al., 2020 53. Oh, S. ∙ Paknejad, N. ∙ Hite, R.K. Gating and selectivity mechanisms for the lysosomal K(+) channel TMEM175 Elife. 2020; 9 :e53430 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutant channels were tested in the whole-cell recording configuration using a high-K + cytosolic solution with pH C = 7.2 to allow us to isolate either inward H + currents ( I H ) or outward K + currents ( I K ). In contrast to the WT and most tested mutant channels ( Figures S6 B and S6C), the D41A mutant TMEM175 channel showed no indication of inward I H at pH E/L of 4.6 (ΔpH = −2.6) but retained normal outward I K that was activated by DCPIB at pH E/L of 7.2 (ΔpH = 0, Figures 4 C–4E) and inhibited by acidic pH E/L of 4.6 or 6.0 ( Figures 4 D and S6 D). Thus, D41A is a selective H + -conductance-deficient mutant of TMEM175. Conversely, compared with the WT and most tested mutant channels, the S45A mutant channel had normal H + permeation but a partial (∼2-fold) loss of K + permeability relative to H + or Na + ( Figures S6 F–S6I). pH i imaging confirmed the incapability of D41A to mediate significant H + flux ( Figures 4 F and 4G), although the mutant proteins were correctly localized to lysosomes ( Figure S6 E), generating large DCPIB-activated whole-LEL I K under neutral pH L .
Genome-wide associated studies (GWASs) have identified several TMEM175 variants, especially p.M393T, as PD risk factors ( Blauwendraat et al., 2019 4. Blauwendraat, C., Heilbron, K., Vallerga, C.L., Bandres-Ciga, S., von Coelln, R., Pihlstrom, L., Simon-Sanchez, J., Schulte, C., Sharma, M., Krohn, L., et al. (2019).

Neurol. 2020; 87 :139-153 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the heterologous overexpression experiments, the M393T mutation did not cause any change in the channel properties of TMEM175, e.g., H + and K + permeability ( Figures S6 F and S6G). However, in M393T KI HEK293T cells where the expression level was controlled by the endogenous promoter, we observed a ∼50% reduction in whole-LEL I LyPAP ( Figures S6 J and S6K), suggesting that, consistent with previous observations ( Jinn et al., 2019 32. Jinn, S. ∙ Blauwendraat, C. ∙ Toolan, D. ... Functionalization of the TMEM175 p.M393T variant as a risk factor for Parkinson disease Hum. Mol.

A growth-factor-activated lysosomal K(+) channel regulates Parkinson's pathology Nature. 2021; 591 :431-437 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), M393T is likely a trafficking mutant.
When pHluorin-expressing HEK293T cells were imaged to monitor the pH i , with a pH E 7.2 or pH 7.6 (ΔpH = 0 or +0.4) bathing solution, application of DCPIB or ArA induced substantial, TMEM175-dependent decreases in pH i ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S7 A, and S7B). Nullifying the membrane potential of the cells using a high K + extracellular solution yielded similar results. Thus, in the absence of an electrochemical gradient of protons across the plasma membrane, DCPIB or ArA likely activated lysosome-localized overexpressed TMEM175 channels to release luminal H + into the cytosol. Indeed, pretreating cells with glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN) to dissipate the lysosomal H + gradient ( Jadot et al., 1984 31. Jadot, M. ∙ Colmant, C. ∙ Wattiaux-De Coninck, S. ... Intralysosomal hydrolysis of glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide The Biochemical journal. 1984; 219 :965-970 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ) abolished the effects of DCPIB or ArA on pH i ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S7 A, and S7B). In addition to activating TMEM175, DCPIB is also known to inhibit LRRC8A-mediated Lyso-VRAC currents ( Li et al., 2020 45. Li, P. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Wang, C. ... LRRC8 family proteins within lysosomes regulate cellular osmoregulation and enhance cell survival to multiple physiological stresses Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117 :29155-29165 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Smaller DCPIB-induced, GPN-pretreatment-sensitive pH i decreases were seen in WT but not in TMEM175 KO HEK293T cells ( Figures 5 C and 5D), suggesting that chemical activation of endogenous TMEM175 proteins is sufficient to induce lysosomal proton release and that the effect of DCPIB on lysosomal proton release is mediated by TMEM175.
We also investigated the effect of TMEM175 activation on pH L using a ratiometric pH-sensitive dye combination (pH-sensitive pHrodo Green Dextran + pH-insensitive CF555 Dextran), which can be loaded to the lysosome lumen via endocytosis. ArA caused a dramatic, time-dependent lysosomal de-acidification (alkalization) in WT but not TMEM175 KO HeLa cells ( Figure 5 E); the V-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin-A1 (Baf-A1) ( Bowman et al., 1988 7. Bowman, E.J. ∙ Siebers, A. ∙ Altendorf, K. ... Bafilomycins: a class of inhibitors of membrane ATPases from microorganisms, animal cells, and plant cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85 :7972-7976 Crossref Scopus (1732) PubMed Google Scholar ) produced luminal de-acidification in both WT and KO cells. DCPIB induced lysosomal de-acidification in both WT and LRRC8A KO HAP1 cells but not in TMEM175 KO HAP1 cells ( Figures S7 C and S7D), suggesting that DCPIB’s effect on lysosomal pH is through its activation effect on TMEM175, not through its inhibition effect on Lyso-VRAC.
Steady-state lysosomal pH likely reflects a balance between proton import mediated by the V-ATPase and proton efflux through TMEM175. In multiple lines of TMEM175 KO cells (HAP1, HEK293T, and HeLa), LysoTracker (LysoTracker™ Red DND-99, a pH-sensitive dye) staining was more intense than in WT cells, yet LAMP1 staining was comparable ( Figures 6 A, 6B, and S7 E), suggesting that the lysosomes of TMEM175 KO cells are hyper-acidified (also see Cang et al. [2015 10. Cang, C. ∙ Aranda, K. ∙ Seo, Y.-j. ... TMEM175 is an organelle K+ channel regulating lysosomal function Cell. 2015; 162 :1101-1112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ] and Jinn et al. [2017 33. Jinn, S. ∙ Drolet, R.E. ∙ Cramer, P.E. ... TMEM175 deficiency impairs lysosomal and mitochondrial function and increases alpha-synuclein aggregation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114 :2389-2394 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ]). Similar results were also seen when lysosomal pH was more accurately determined by using three separate sets of ratiometric dyes: pHrodo Green Dextran ( Figure 5 E), LysoSensor Yellow/Blue DND-160 ( Figure S7 F), and Oregon Green™ 488 Dextran ( Figures 6 C and S7 G). When the fluorescence ratios were calibrated to pH values, we found that TMEM175 KO HeLa cells displayed significant lysosomal hyperacidity (∼0.3 pH unit), which was brought back toward normal by partially inhibiting the V-ATPase with a low concentration (1 nM) of Baf-A1 ( Figure 6 C). Conversely, HEK293T cell lines stably overexpressing TMEM175 showed significant lysosomal hypoacidity ( Figures S7 H and S7I). The lysosomal hyperacidity of KO cells was corrected by re-expressing WT TMEM175 or the S45A mutant but not the D41A mutant ( Figures 6 D, 6E, S7 J, and S7K). Together with the ArA/DCPIB effects on lysosomal acidity, these results suggest that the H + conductance, but not K + conductance of TMEM175, is required for the regulation of lysosomal pH homeostasis. Whereas increasing TMEM175 expression/activity raises steady-state lysosomal pH (alkaline shift in the set-point pH; hypo-acidification), decreasing TMEM175 expression/activity reduces steady-state lysosomal pH (acidic shift in the set-point pH; hyper-acidification).
Many lysosomal hydrolases, such as Cathepsin B and Cathepsin D, require a narrow optimal pH range for their enzymatic activities ( Briozzo et al., 1988 8. Briozzo, P. ∙ Morisset, M. ∙ Capony, F. ...

Purification and characterization of cathepsin B from the muscle of horse mackerel Trachurus japonicus Mar. Drugs. 2015; 13 :6550-6565 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). The overall lysosomal hydrolytic activity, assayed by DQ™-BSA-red dye staining ( Ashcom and Jacobson, 1989 1. Ashcom, J.D. ∙ Jacobson, L.A. Self-quenched fluorogenic protein substrates for the detection of cathepsin D and other protease activities Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176 :261-264 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), was decreased in TMEM175 KO HeLa cells compared with WT cells but was fully restored in KO cells stably re-expressing WT TMEM175 but not the D41A mutant ( Figures S7 L and S7M). Using Magic Red, a fluorogenic substrate for Cathepsin B ( Creasy et al., 2007 18. Creasy, B.M. ∙ Hartmann, C.B. ∙ White, F.K.H. ...

Moreover, 1 nM Baf-A1, the concentration that normalized the lysosomal pH of KO cells (pH optimization; see Figure 6 C), brought Cathepsin B activity back to the normal level ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Similarly, the amount of active Cathepsin D, assayed with Pepstatin A BODIPY FL ( Chen et al., 2000 15. Chen, C.S. ∙ Chen, W.N.U. ∙ Zhou, M. ...

The protein levels of Cathepsins B and D were not decreased in KO cells compared with WT cells ( Figure S7 N). Taken together, these results suggest that the H + conductance of TMEM175 plays an essential role in the pH-dependent regulation of optimal activities of lysosomal hydrolases.
To investigate the in vivo role of TMEM175, we generated Tmem175 KO ( Tmem175 −/− ) mice using CRISPR-Cas9 ( Ran et al., 2013 60. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 A). Motor skills are compromised in a similar line of Tmem175 KO mice ( Wie et al., 2021 76. Wie, J. ∙ Liu, Z. ∙ Song, H. ...

In cultured hippocampal neurons isolated from Tmem175 −/− mice, we confirmed the essential roles of TMEM175 in mediating LyPAP ( Figures 7 B and 7C), regulation of lysosomal steady-state pH ( Figure 7 D), agonist-induced lysosomal proton release ( Figure 7 E), and Cathepsin B activity ( Figure 7 F). TMEM175 has been recently identified as a genetic risk factor for PD ( Blauwendraat et al., 2019 4.

Section: Discussion

To maintain the pH L optimal for lysosomal degradation (pH 4.5–5.0), the proton influx and efflux pathways need to function coordinately on the lysosomal membrane. While the V-type H + ATPase actively imports H + into the lysosome lumen, proton efflux pathways are required to passively release H + into the cytosol (see Figure 7 I). There are several H + -coupled transporters on the lysosomal membrane that may mediate slow H + leak during their active transport cycle ( Casey et al., 2010 11. Casey, J.R. ∙ Grinstein, S. ∙ Orlowski, J. Sensors and regulators of intracellular pH Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :50-61 Crossref Scopus (1736) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kalatzis et al., 2001 35. Kalatzis, V. ∙ Cherqui, S. ∙ Antignac, C. ...

Mindell, J.A. Lysosomal acidification mechanisms Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74 :69-86 Crossref Scopus (885) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, CLCN7, by acting as a lysosomal Cl − /H + exchanger, may consume the H + gradient while transporting Cl − ( Graves et al., 2008 25. Graves, A.R. ∙ Curran, P.K. ∙ Smith, C.L. ... The Cl-/H+ antiporter ClC-7 is the primary chloride permeation pathway in lysosomes Nature. 2008; 453 :788-792 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, lysosomes lacking CLCN7 appear to have a normal steady-state pH ( Kasper et al., 2005 36. Kasper, D. ∙ Planells-Cases, R. ∙ Fuhrmann, J.C. ... Loss of the chloride channel ClC-7 leads to lysosomal storage disease and neurodegeneration EMBO J. 2005; 24 :1079-1091 Crossref Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steinberg et al., 2010 71.

A cation counterflux supports lysosomal acidification The Journal of cell biology. 2010; 189 :1171-1186 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, the slow, transporter-mediated proton leak pathways are unlikely to be the primary proton efflux mechanism that maintains the lysosomal pH optimum. Instead, a fast, channel-mediated H + leak conductance can effectively prevent lysosomal over-acidification by responding dedicatedly to the trigger: a change in the pH L . At normal lysosomal pH (pH 4.5–5.0), this H + leak is slightly active; during hyper-acidification, e.g., < pH 4.5, the activity of H + leak is dramatically elevated; during hypo-acidification, e.g., > pH 5.0, the activity of H + leak is suppressed (see Figure 7 I). We identified TMEM175 as a pH L -activated H + -selective channel that is required for this dedicated H + leak. In contrast, TRPML1 and TPC1, which were previously suggested to encode the H + leak channel in lysosomes ( Pitt et al., 2014 56. Pitt, S.J. ∙ Lam, A.K.M. ∙ Rietdorf, K. ...

Dong, X.P. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Mills, E. ...

Xu, H. ∙ Ren, D. Lysosomal physiology Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77 :57-80 Crossref Scopus (745) PubMed Google Scholar ) and had no role in lysosomal H + leak. The slow, non-dedicated H + leak pathways, e.g., those mediated by CLCN7 or other H + -coupled transporters, might make supplementary or compensatory contributions to lysosomal pH homeostasis, especially outside of normal pH range, as was observed in V-ATPase-inhibited cells or TMEM175 KO cells.
TMEM175 was previously reported to be a lysosomal K + -permeable/selective channel under neutral pH ( Cang et al., 2015 10. Cang, C. ∙ Aranda, K. ∙ Seo, Y.-j. ... TMEM175 is an organelle K+ channel regulating lysosomal function Cell. 2015; 162 :1101-1112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is non-physiological for healthy lysosomes. We demonstrate in the present study that with the normal physiological H + and K + gradients across lysosomes ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), TMEM175-mediated K + flux is suppressed but H + flux is stimulated, so ion flow through TMEM175 is almost exclusively carried by protons (>90%) at physiological lysosomal membrane potential ( Koivusalo et al., 2011 38. Koivusalo, M. ∙ Steinberg, B.E. ∙ Mason, D. ... In situ measurement of the electrical potential across the lysosomal membrane using FRET Traffic. 2011; 12 :972-982 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saminathan et al., 2021 63. Saminathan, A. ∙ Devany, J. ∙ Veetil, A.T. ... A DNA-based voltmeter for organelles Nat. Nanotechnol. 2021; 16 :96-103 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with our observations, a recent study published during the final review process of our current work demonstrated that at acidic pH, TMEM175 is not only permeant to proton, but also undergoes pH-dependent structural changes that reduce K + permeation ( Zheng et al., 2022 87. Zheng, W. ∙ Shen, C. ∙ Wang, L. ... pH regulates potassium conductance and drives a constitutive proton current in human TMEM175 Sci. Adv. 2022; 8 :eabm1568 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting the dominance of proton flux through endogenous TMEM175 in native lysosomes, the basal K + /Cs + current in the lysosome is barely detectable, while H + current is sizable. Hence, just like Ca 2+ -selective channels that allow Na + or K + permeation in the absence of Ca 2+ ( Sather and McCleskey, 2003 65. Sather, W.A. ∙ McCleskey, E.W. Permeation and selectivity in calcium channels Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65 :133-159 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), as an H + -selective channel, TMEM175 may permit K + permeation in the nominal “absence” of H + under certain experimental conditions or if localized in non-lysosomal compartments.
Loss of TMEM175 was previously proposed to affect lysosomal pH homeostasis through an indirect regulation via TMEM175-mediated K + flux ( Cang et al., 2015 10. Cang, C. ∙ Aranda, K. ∙ Seo, Y.-j. ... TMEM175 is an organelle K+ channel regulating lysosomal function Cell. 2015; 162 :1101-1112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ), e.g., as a counter-ion mechanism ( Mindell, 2012 50. Mindell, J.A. Lysosomal acidification mechanisms Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74 :69-86 Crossref Scopus (885) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steinberg et al., 2010 71. Steinberg, B.E. ∙ Huynh, K.K. ∙ Brodovitch, A. ... A cation counterflux supports lysosomal acidification The Journal of cell biology. 2010; 189 :1171-1186 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this hypothesis, K + efflux from lysosomes would provide the counter ion required for continuous V-ATPase-mediated pumping of H + into lysosomes ( Mindell, 2012 50. Mindell, J.A. Lysosomal acidification mechanisms Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74 :69-86 Crossref Scopus (885) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steinberg et al., 2010 71. Steinberg, B.E. ∙ Huynh, K.K. ∙ Brodovitch, A. ... A cation counterflux supports lysosomal acidification The Journal of cell biology. 2010; 189 :1171-1186 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, under physiological conditions, the electrochemical gradient of K + favors K + influx into lysosomes ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the inhibitory effect of H + on TMEM175-mediated K + flux is also contradictory to a role in providing the counter ion. Furthermore, if TMEM175’s K + conductance indeed plays a role in this counter ion regulation of lysosomal pH, one would expect that lysosomes are hypo-acidified in TMEM175 KO cells and hyper-acidified in TMEM175-overexpressing cells. However, opposite results were observed: lysosomes are hypo-acidified in TMEM175-overexpressing cells and hyper-acidified in the KO cells. Thus, the H + conductance, but not K + conductance of TMEM175, seems to be primarily responsible for all of the pH-dependent lysosomal functions of TMEM175 investigated in the present study: pH L -regulated lysosomal H + release, setting the lysosomal pH optimum, agonist-induced regulation of lysosomal pH, and pH-dependent Cathepsin B/D activity. Supporting this conclusion are the results from the mutational analyses (e.g., D41A and S45A) and pH normalization experiments.
The proton permeation pathway of TMEM175 can be activated by at least two distinct mechanisms. First, TMEM175 is activated by luminal protons. At the normal lysosomal pH (i.e., the set-point), a small LyPAP current is present to offset basal proton influx produced by V-ATPase, but when the lysosome lumen is over-acidified by the V-ATPase to below the set-point (i.e., pH L < 4.5), both the H + driving force and channel macroscopic conductance increase dramatically. Because the key pH-sensitive site (D41) may be located in the conduction pathway, proton activation and permeation may initially reinforce each other via a positive feedback mechanism, resulting in a rapid surge in proton efflux once lysosomes are hyper-acidified below the set-point pH. Subsequently, the substantial proton release will effectively prevent further luminal acidification (see Figure 7 I). Thus, in native lysosomes, a negative feedback loop is operative to “clamp” lysosomal pH close to the set-point. What is unique about this negative feedback loop is that the sensor and the response element are integrated into one protein: a proton-activated, proton-permeant channel. Second, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as ArA can exert a non-pH control over TMEM175 activity. Therefore, cellular cues that modulate TMEM175 may effectively change the pH-dependent activation of TMEM175, resulting in a new set-point and steady-state pH. The various compartments of the endocytic pathway (early endosomes, late endosomes, lysosomes, and secretory vesicles) have pH L s between 4.5 and 6.5 ( Casey et al., 2010 11. Casey, J.R. ∙ Grinstein, S. ∙ Orlowski, J. Sensors and regulators of intracellular pH Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :50-61 Crossref Scopus (1736) PubMed Google Scholar ). The observations that TMEM175 expression is highly enriched in lysosomes and that the activation pH for endogenous TMEM175 is close to pH 4.6 are consistent with the idea that these channels may play a particularly important role in regulating lysosomal pH homoeostasis. However, in the presence of endogenous agonists such as ArA or a related lipid, proton flow through TMEM175 could occur in less-acidic organelles such as early endosomes. We hypothesize that both the V-ATPase and TMEM175 are regulated in their activity and lysosomal abundance to achieve the dynamicity and variety of endolysosomal pH in cells.
Compromised lysosome function due to abnormal lysosomal pH may play a causative role in the pathologies of a range of diseases, including LSDs, AD, and PD ( Bourdenx et al., 2016 6.

TMEM175 has been identified by several recent GWAS studies as a genetic risk factor for PD ( Blauwendraat et al., 2019 4. Blauwendraat, C., Heilbron, K., Vallerga, C.L., Bandres-Ciga, S., von Coelln, R., Pihlstrom, L., Simon-Sanchez, J., Schulte, C., Sharma, M., Krohn, L., et al. (2019).

Neurol. 2020; 87 :139-153 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings that TMEM175, as a proton-activated, proton-selective channel required for the maintenance of lysosomal pH optimum, regulates Cathepsins B/D activity at the cellular level, and the clearance of α-synuclein aggregation in vivo may provide a new opportunity for understanding the pathologies of PD and LSDs. Importantly, pH optimization or restoring TMEM175’s H + permeability results in normal lysosomal proteolytic activity in TMEM175 KO cells, providing a proof of concept that modulation of TMEM175 activity in the lysosome could help develop therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
Although our collective evidence suggests that the H + conductance of TMEM175 is likely more important than its K + conductance, without a mutation that selectively and completely abolishes K + permeability (S45A is only a partial K + -conductance-deficient mutant), one cannot completely rule out the roles of TMEM175’s K + permeability in regulating lysosomal functions. Specifically, at lysosomal pH, the K + permeability of TMEM175, albeit very small, could still contribute to K + flux in native lysosomes under certain untested cellular conditions. Moreover, even though an acidic environment favors H + over K + flux, the presence of endogenous non-proton agonists (e.g., ArA), which activate both H + and K + conductance, may increase the relative contribution of K + flux. Thus, the K + permeability, an evolutionarily preserved biophysical feature of TMEM175 which is well documented and confirmed in the present study, might play a role in mammalian cells when TMEM175 is located in less acidic compartments, e.g., early endosomes and newly formed (un-acidified) autolysosomes, or under neutral pH conditions, e.g., at the plasma membranes when cells undergo lysosomal exocytosis ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future development of synthetic agonists/inhibitors selective for the K + or H + permeation pathway and analyses of TMEM175 mutant variant (e.g., D41A) KI mice may reveal the roles of H + vs . K + flux in lysosome function, cell physiology, and PD pathology.

COS1, HEK293T, and HeLa cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in a high glucose DMEM (Gibco) medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, 100–106, Gemini Bio-Products). HAP1 cells (Horizon Discovery Ltd.) were maintained in IMDM (Gibco) with 10% FBS. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All cells were used at low passages with occasional authentication for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert™ Mycoplasma Detection Kit (LT07-218, Lonza).
TMEM175 knockout (KO) HAP1, HeLa, HEK293T, TMEM175-HA knockin (KI) HAP1 cell lines, and M393T KI HEK293T cells were created using a CRISPR-Cas9 system ( Ran et al., 2013 60. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ). The guide RNA (gRNA) targeting exon 10 (5’-CGCGTGGAAGCCTTCAGCGA-3’) was designed to generate KO cell lines that resulted in a frameshift near the IIS1 helix (see Figure S2 A). For HA-tagged KI cells, a 2.2 kb human genomic DNA region spanning exon 11 with ∼1.4 kb intron sequence was PCR amplified and inserted into a backbone vector. HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) linked by five (5) glycine was then inserted at the end of the Open Reading Frame (ORF) using site-directed mutagenesis to generate the template plasmid. The gRNA targeting the intron downstream of exon 11 (5′-TGTCCTCCCTGGTCCATCTC-3′) was designed to trigger homologous recombination (see Figure S2 E). The gRNA was cloned into pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-puro vector (Addgene) and transfected into target cells alone (for KO) or together with the template plasmid (for KI) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After puromycin (Gibco) selection for 48 h, the remaining cells were trypsin-digested, and plated into 96-well plates in order to select single monoclonal cell populations. The frameshift in KO cells and the in-place insertion of HA-tag in KI cells were confirmed with PCR and DNA sequencing. M393T knock-in HEK293T cells were generated using the sgRNA (5′-CGGCCGCCAAACCACACCGA-3′) and site-directed mutagenesis.
Tmem175 KO ( Tmem175 −/− ) mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology ( Ran et al., 2013 60. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ) with two single guide RNAs: sgRNA1: 5’-GCACTAATACTCTTAGCCTG-3’; sgRNA2: 5’-GGACCCCTTACAATATGCCT-3’, which were designed to create a ∼8.2 kb chromosomal deletion (exons 2–11) at the Tmem175 loci in the mouse genome. After the transcription of sgRNA in vitro , zygote microinjection was performed on the C57BL/6N mouse strain. Heterozygous intercrossing generated Tmem175 −/− mice with the expected Mendelian ratio. The genotype of newborn mice was confirmed by PCR electrophoresis with primers: WT-1: 5’-CATTCCTGTTGCTCCGTCTCCTTGT-3’; WT-2: 5’-CGCCAGGGAAGCTCTGTACTTTTGA-3’; KO-1: 5’-TGCTATGCTGAGCTTATAGCCTTG-3’; KO-2: 5’-AACGTTCCAAGAAGGAGGATCGCC-3’. All animals were used according to approved animal protocols and institutional animal care guidelines at the University of Michigan and were maintained in a standard 12-hour light and dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. For the neuronal culture experiments, Tmem175 +/+ and Tmem175 −/− mice in the C57BL/6N background (both sex) at postnatal day 1 were used. For the α-Syn aggregation experiments, Tmem175 +/+ and Tmem175 −/− mice in the C57BL/6N background (male only) between 3 to 4 months of age were used.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the template of EGFP-TMEM175 (pEZ-M29, GeneCopoeia) or mCherry-TMEM175 (pEZ-M55, GeneCopoeia) using either a QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (200,523, Agilent) or a Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (E5510S, New England Biolabs). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
All cDNA plasmid constructs in the LMP library are from the human genes and the proteins were tagged with either EGFP or mCherry. Among them, C1orf85 , CLCN4 , SCARB2 , and SLC36A1 were purchased from Origene; CLN8 , LMBRD1 , MFSD12 , MFSD6 , OCA2 , SLC15A3 , SLC15A4 , SLC17A5 , SLC17A9 , SLC35F6 , SLC38A7 , SLC38A9 , SLC46A3 , SLC48A1 , SLC7A14 , TMEM123 , TMEM175 , TMEM179b , TMEM184c , TMEM243 , TMEM55b , and TTYH2 were purchased from GeneCopoeia; the NHE6 (pEGFP-N3) plasmid was a gift from Dr. Rajini Rao (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine).
Ionic currents were recorded in the whole-cell configuration under voltage-clamp using an Axonpatch 200B amplifier equipped with a Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices). Unless otherwise stated, both pipette (cytosolic) and bath (extracellular) solutions contained NMDG-MSA as the major ions. The pipette (cytosolic) solution usually contained (in mM): 150 NMDG and 20 HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with MSA). The pipette solution was supplemented with essential Cl − (2 mM) needed to stably conduct electricity through Ag/AgCl electrode. To vary the pH of the bath (extracellular) solution from 7.2-3.5, an appropriate pH buffer (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MES, or 10 mM citrate acid) with its pKa near the target pH was used, and the solution was supplemented with sufficient NMDG (120–150 mM) to bring the final osmolarity to ∼300 mOsm (pH adjusted with MSA). All bath solutions were applied via a perfusion system that allowed us to achieve complete solution exchange within a few seconds. The Cl − free solution used extracellularly was essential to prevent activation of H + -activated Cl − currents on the plasma membrane ( Yang et al., 2019 81. Yang, J. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Del Carmen Vitery, M. ... PAC, an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein, is a proton-activated chloride channel Science. 2019; 364 :395-399 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). An agar bridge filled with 3M KCl was used for the reference electrode. Glass electrodes were pulled with a resistance of 2–4 MΩ. A ramp protocol (−120 mV to +120 mV, 400 ms, holding at 0 mV) was used to record the currents at 2 second intervals. In some experiments, the holding potential was set to E rev in order to minimize proton flux between recordings. Data were collected using a Clampex 10.7 software (Molecular Devices). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25°C), and all data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices), Origin 2018 (OriginLab) or Prism 8.4 (Graphpad).
Endolysosomal electrophysiology was performed in isolated enlarged endolysosomes using a modified patch-clamp method ( Dong et al., 2008 23. Dong, X.P. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Mills, E. ... The type IV mucolipidosis-associated protein TRPML1 is an endolysosomal iron release channel Nature. 2008; 455 :992-996 Crossref Scopus (451) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were treated with 1 μM vacuolin-1 (673,000, Millipore Sigma), a lipid-soluble polycyclic triazine that can selectively increase the size of LELs ( Huynh and Andrews, 2005 28. Huynh, C. ∙ Andrews, N.W. The small chemical vacuolin-1 alters the morphology of lysosomes without inhibiting Ca2+-regulated exocytosis EMBO Rep. 2005; 6 :843-847 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), for at least 1h and up to 12 h. Whole-LEL recordings were performed on enlarged endolysosomes manually isolated from various cells. In brief, a glass pipette was pressed against a cell and quickly pulled away to break the cell membrane. Enlarged LELs were released out of the hole in the plasma membrane and visualized under an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus). If applicable, the fluorescence emission was confirmed on the membrane of isolated endolysosomes expressing fluorescent proteins. After formation of a giga-seal between the glass pipette and the isolated endolysosome, capacitance transients were compensated. Voltage steps of several hundred millivolt (mV) with a 1–10 millisecond (ms) duration were then applied to break the vacuolar membrane. The whole-LEL configuration was verified by the re-appearance of capacitance transients after break-in.
Unless otherwise stated, both bath (cytosolic) and pipette (luminal) solutions contained NMDG-MSA as the major ions. The bath (cytosolic) solution contained (in mM): 150 NMDG and 20 HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with MSA); the pipette (luminal) solution at pH 4.6 contained (in mM): 150 NMDG and 20 MES (pH adjusted with MSA). The pipette (luminal) solution at pH 3.5 contained (in mM): 110 NMDG and 25 citrate acid (pH adjusted with MSA). The pipette solution was supplemented with essential Cl − (2 mM) needed to stably conduct electricity through the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. An agar bridge filled with 3M KCl was used for the reference electrode. Lysosomal transmembrane potential (V m ) is defined as V Cytosol - V Lumen ( Li et al., 2019 44. Li, P. ∙ Gu, M. ∙ Xu, H. Lysosomal ion channels as decoders of cellular signals Trends Biochem. Sci. 2019; 44 :110-124 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) for consistency with whole-cell recordings (V m = V Cytosol - V Extracellular ). A ramp protocol (−120 mV to +120 mV, 400 ms, holding at 0 mV) was used to record the currents at 2 s intervals. In some experiments, the holding potential was set to E rev in order to minimize proton flux between recordings. Data were collected using an Axonpatch 200B amplifier, Digidata 1440A Digitizer, and Clampex 10.7 software (Molecular Devices). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25°C), and all data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices), Origin 2018 (OriginLab) or Prism 8.4 (Graphpad).
Endolysosomal lumen-side-out recordings were performed on giant excised patches as previously described ( Wang et al., 2017a 73. Wang, W. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Gao, Q. ... A voltage-dependent K+ channel in the lysosome is required for refilling lysosomal Ca2+ stores The Journal of cell biology. 2017; 216 :1715-1730 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, after formation of a giga-seal between the glass pipette and isolated endolysosome, the glass pipette was pulled away to obtain a giant excised patch, in which the luminal side faced outside. Both pipette (cytosolic) and bath (luminal) solutions were the same as those used in the whole-cell recordings. Glass electrodes were pulled with the resistance 1–2 MΩ.
The permeability of TMEM175 for H + relative to other monovalent cations (K + , Na + , or NMDG + ) was estimated based on the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equations ( Lewis, 1979 43. Lewis, C.A. Ion-concentration dependence of the reversal potential and the single channel conductance of ion channels at the frog neuromuscular junction The Journal of physiology. 1979; 286 :417-445 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the measured E rev using “bi-ionic” conditions: 𝑃 𝐻 𝑃 𝑋 = [ 𝑋 + ] 𝑒 − [ 𝑋 + ] 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑒 ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑉 / 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑇 ) [ 𝐻 + ] 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑒 ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑉 / 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑇 ) − [ 𝐻 + ] 𝑒 where R, T, F and V are the gas constant, absolute temperature, Faraday’s constant and the reversal potential, respectively. Note that because [H + ] was several orders of magnitude less than [Na + ] or [K + ], the term “bi-ionic” is loosely adopted. Assumed ion activity coefficients are 1 for monovalent ions. The liquid junction potentials were measured and corrected as described ( Neher, 1992 51. Neher, E. Correction for liquid junction potentials in patch clamp experiments Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207 :123-131 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The pipette (cytosolic) solution, buffered with 20 mM HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.2), contained either 150 mM NMDG-MSA, Na-MSA, or 140 mM K-MSA. The pipette solution containing NMDG + or Na + was supplemented with Cl − (2 mM) in order to stably conduct electricity through the Ag/AgCl electrode. In the whole-cell recording, the pipette solution containing K-MSA also included 10 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA + ) chloride that was used to block the endogenous basal outward K + currents in HEK293T cells. An agar bridge filled with 3 M KCl was used for the reference electrode. E rev was determined using a ramp protocol (−120 mV to +120 mV, 400 ms, holding at 0 mV) in response to bath (extracellular) solutions at varied pH (see whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology section). Note that in the whole-cell recordings, after prolonged exposures to acidic pH E/L , the pipette/cytosolic solution can become acidified due to repeated ramp currents and sustained inward currents at the holding potential that may saturate the pH buffers. Subsequently, the outward H + currents will grow, and the H + reversal potential will gradually shift leftward. When such experimentally-induced H + accumulation in the cytosolic side occurred, the current traces were excluded from the E rev analysis.
Cytosolic pH dynamics were determined by time-lapse imaging using pHluorin, a genetically-encoded pH indicator ( Miesenbock et al., 1998 49. Miesenböck, G. ∙ De Angelis, D.A. ∙ Rothman, J.E. Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins Nature. 1998; 394 :192-195 Crossref Scopus (2093) PubMed Google Scholar ), or the chemical pH sensor pHrodo™ Red. When binding H + intracellularly, the brightly fluorescent pHluorin is quenched to a lower level, while the dim fluorescence of pHrodo™ Red gets brighter.
The pHluorin plasmid was sub-cloned from NPY-pHluorin (a gift from Dr. Zhuan Zhou, Peking University, China) ( Wang et al., 2017b 75. Wang, Y. ∙ Wu, Q. ∙ Hu, M. ... Ligand- and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels differentially regulate the mode of vesicular neuropeptide release in mammalian sensory neurons Sci. Signal. 2017; 10 :eaal1683 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells seeded on glass coverslips were transfected with pHluorin together with mCherry-TMEM175 or mCherry sham vector (both in pEZ-M55) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with the imaging solution at pH 7.2 and imaged with a spinning-disk confocal microscope (IX81, Olympus; CSU-X1, Yokogawa) equipped with a 20× objective lens and a temperature controller that kept the cells at 37°C. The imaging solution at 7.2 or 4.6 usually contained 100 mM pH buffer (HEPES or MES) supplemented with either N-methyl-D-glucamine methanesulfonate (NMDG-MSA), tetramethylammonium methanesulfonate (TMA-MSA), potassium methanesulfonate (K-MSA), or sodium methanesulfonate (Na-MSA). The final osmolarity was ∼300 mOsm for all imaging solutions. In a subset of experiments, Tyrode’s solution at pH 7.4 (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose) and a modified Tyrode’s-like solution at pH 4.6 (replacing HEPES with MES) were used as imaging solutions. Prior to imaging, a single image was acquired using excitation at 561 nm to identify the cells expressing mCherry-TMEM175 or mCherry. The fluorescence emissions excited at 488 nm were then acquired every 5 s with an EMCCD camera (Andor, iXon ultra 897U) controlled by MetaMorph software. Un-dissociated acetic acid (HOAc; 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM HOAc, pH 5.0 adjusted by NaOH) freely entering the cytosol, where it dissociates into a H + and an acetic ion, served as a positive control to acidify the cytosol ( Ylitervo et al., 2014 82. Ylitervo, P. ∙ Franzén, C. ∙ Taherzadeh, M.J. Continuous ethanol production with a membrane bioreactor at high acetic Acid concentrations Membranes. 2014; 4 :372-387 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Free NH 3 (NH 4 Cl; 110 mM NaCl, 50 mM NH 4 Cl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 adjusted by NaOH) may enter cytosol, where it associates with H + to generate NH 4 + , served as an alkalizing agent to confirm the availability of pHluorin ( Decoursey, 2003 22. Decoursey, T.E. Voltage-gated proton channels and other proton transfer pathways Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83 :475-579 Crossref Scopus (598) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The chemical-based intracellular pH indicator, pHrodo™ Red AM (P35372, Invitrogen), was also used to determine intracellular pH. Cells were transfected with EGFP-TMEM175 (pEZ-M29, GeneCopoeia) or EGFP sham vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were loaded with the pHrodo™ Red AM according to the manufacturer’s instructions and washed with the imaging solution at pH 7.2. In these experiments, a single image was acquired using excitation at 488 nm to identify the cells expressing EGFP-TMEM175. The fluorescence emissions excited at 561 nm were then acquired every 5 s. The fluorescence intensity in cells were quantified using the Fiji/ImageJ software.
Lysosomal pH measurement with a ratiometric pH-sensitive dye Oregon Green™ 488 conjugated dextran-10 kd (D7170, Molecular Probes) was performed as described previously ( Christensen et al., 2002 17. Christensen, K.A. ∙ Myers, J.T. ∙ Swanson, J.A. pH-dependent regulation of lysosomal calcium in macrophages J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 :599-607 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Davis et al., 2012 20. Davis, M.J. ∙ Gregorka, B. ∙ Gestwicki, J.E. ... Inducible renitence limits Listeria monocytogenes escape from vacuoles in macrophages J. Immunol. 2012; 189 :4488-4495 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, cells seeded on glass coverslips were loaded with 150 μg/mL Oregon Green™ 488 Dextran overnight and chased in medium without dye for three hours before imaging. Cells were washed with Ringer’s buffer (in mM): 155 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 2 NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4) and imaged using a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope equipped with a 60× objective lens (N.A. = 1.4) and a temperature-controlled stage. The fluorescence emission (530 nm) excited at 440 nm and 490 nm wavelengths were acquired with a cooled digital CCD camera (Quantix Photometrics) controlled by MetaMorph software. pH calibration was performed to generate the pH standard curve. pH standard buffers (in mM: 130 KCl, 1 MgCl 2 , 15 HEPES, and 15 MES) were prepared at varied pH ranging from 3.0 to 8.0 supplemented with 10 μM valinomycin and 10 μM nigericin. The ratio of fluorescence intensities excited at 440 and 490 nm in response to varied pH was fitted to sigmoidal equation to generate the pH standard curve. The lysosomal pH values were then calculated with the resulting intensity ratio (440 nm/490 nm) images based on the standard curve.
Lysosomal luminal acidity was estimated with the fluorescence ratio between a pH-sensitive dye pHrodo™ Green conjugated dextran-10 kd (P35368, Invitrogen) and a pH-insensitive dye CF555 conjugated dextran-10 kd (80112, Biotium). In brief, cells seeded on glass coverslips were loaded with 20 μg/mL of each dextran overnight and chased in medium without dye for 3 h before imaging. The HEPES buffered DMEM medium without phenol red (21063029, Gibco) was used as the imaging solution to eliminate the short time starvation side effects during imaging process. Cells were washed with the imaging solution and imaged using an inverted microscope (IX81 Olympus) equipped with a 60× objective lens and a temperature-controlled stage. The fluorescence emission excited at 488 and 561 nm wavelengths were acquired with an EM-CCD camera (Andor, iXon ultra 897U) controlled by MetaMorph software. The fluorescence intensity of pHrodo™ Green and CF555 were quantified by Fiji/ImageJ.
For a rough determination of lysosomal acidity, cells were cultured in a 24-well dish one day before the experiment. To visualize the acidic organelles, 50 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (L7528, Invitrogen) was added into the cell culture medium and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with Tyrode’s solution and kept in Tyrode’s for imaging. Images were acquired using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX81, Olympus), and the fluorescence intensity of LysoTracker was quantified by Fiji/ImageJ software.
For LysoSensor staining, LysoSensor Yellow/Blue DND-160 (L7545, Invitrogen) was added into the cell culture medium and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The fluorescence emission (530 nm) excited at 340 and 380 nm wavelengths were acquired with a cooled digital CCD camera. The ratio of fluorescence intensities excited at 340 and 380 nm in response to varied pH was fitted to sigmoidal equation to generate the pH standard curve. The lysosomal pH values were calculated with the resulting intensity ratio (340 nm/380 nm) images based on the standard curve.
Cathepsin B and Cathepsin D activities in the lysosomes were determined using Magic Red Cathepsin B assay kit (937, ImmunoChemistry Technologies) and Pepstatin A BODIPY™ FL (P12271, Invitrogen), respectively. Overall lysosomal hydrolytic activity was determined with DQ™-BSA red dye (D12051, Invitrogen). Magic Red, Pepstatin A BODIPY™ FL, and DQ™-BSA red stock solutions were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated with Magic Red (1:1,000 dilution) or Pepstatin A, BODIPY FL (2 μM) at 37°C for 1 h and washed twice with Tyrode’s solution before imaging. For overall lysosomal hydrolytic activity detection, cells were loaded with DQ-BSA red dye (10 μg/mL) for 16 h. Images were taken using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX81, Olympus) and the fluorescence intensities of Magic Red/BODIPY FL/DQ-BSA were quantified with Fiji (ImageJ).
Cells seeded on glass coverslips were washed with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) or cold anhydrous methanol. Afterwards, 0.3% Triton-X 100 in block solution (PBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin) was used to permeate the phospholipid membrane (only for PFA fixation). Cells were incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4°C and with a secondary antibody for one hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies (anti-human LAMP1 (H4A3), DSHB, 1:200; anti-HA (3F10), 11867423001, Roche, 1:200) and second antibodies (anti-mouse conjugated to Texas Red, T862, Life Technologies, 1:500; anti-rat conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, A11006, Life Technologies, 1:500) were diluted into the block solution proportionally as indicated. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount-G (0100-01, Southern Biotech). Images were acquired with an inverted confocal microscope (IX81, Olympus) equipped with an oil 60 × objective lens.
To analyze the level of specific proteins in cells, cells grown to 70–80% confluence in a 35 mm dish were lysed with 100 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer (RIPA, cat. No. BP-115, Boston Bioproducts) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma Aldrich). For detection of phosphorylated proteins, the lysis buffer was additionally supplemented with 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na-orthovanadate, 2 mM EDTA, and Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I (P0044, Sigma). The lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected, mixed with 4X LDS sample buffer (NP0007, Invitrogen), heated at 75°C for 15 min, and subjected to immunoblotting. Pierce™ BCA™ Protein Assay (23227, Invitrogen) was used to quantify the protein concentration. Primary antibodies [anti-GFP (clone 7.1 and 13.1), 11814460001, Roche, 1:1000; anti-p-Akt(Thr308), 2965, CST, 1:1000; anti-Akt(pan) (C67E7), 4691, CST, 1:1000; Anti-Cathepsin B (EPR4323), ab125067, Abcam, 1:1000; Anti-Cathepsin D (EPR3057Y), ab75852, Abcam, 1:1000; anti-β-Actin (AC-74), A5316, Sigma, 1:1000] were diluted into the block solution (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 2% BSA) proportionally as indicated. Odyssey CLx imaging system (Li-cor) was used to scan PVDF membrane (IPFL00010, Millipore) after incubation with a secondary antibody [IRDye® 680RD Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), 926-68070, Li-cor, 1:5000; IRDye® 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), 926-32211, Li-cor, 1:5000] at room temperature for 1 hour. Band intensities were quantified using Image Studio software (Li-cor).
For the isolation of mouse hippocampal neurons, hippocampi were dissected from mice at postnatal day 1 and treated with 0.25% trypsin at 37°C for 30 min. Neurons were plated on Poly-D-lysine (A-003-E, Millipore) coated glass coverslips in 12-well plates and settled down in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS for 3 hours. Afterwards the culture medium was replaced with Neurobasal (Gibco) supplemented with 0.5 mM Glutamine and 2% B-27 (Gibco) for longtime culture. Cultured neurons were fed every 2 days by replacing half of the old medium with fresh Neurobasal medium. Cultured neurons at 7–14 DIV were used for all the imaging and electrophysiological experiments.
Recombinant mouse WT α-Syn fibril stock (α-Syn pff, 5 mg/mL) (a gift from Dr. Kelvin C. Luk, the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine) was diluted with sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS, without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ) to 2 mg/mL in a tube (520216, Covaris) for sonication for 30 min (30 s ON, 30 s OFF, repeating for 30 cycles at a constant temperature of 10°C) with a ultra-sonicator (M220, Covaris).
α-Syn pff was injected into mouse brain following an established procedure as described ( Zhang et al., 2019a 84. Zhang, B. ∙ Kehm, V. ∙ Gathagan, R. ... Stereotaxic targeting of alpha-synuclein pathology in mouse brain using preformed fibrils Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1948 :45-57 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice between 3 to 4 months of age were anesthetized with isoflurane (Fluriso™, 501017, VetOne). Sonicated pff (2.5 μL) or vehicle control (D-PBS) was stereotaxically injected in the dorsal striatum (+0.2 mm from Bregma, 2 mm from midline, −2.6 mm beneath the brain surface) of one hemisphere. Injections were performed using a 10 μL syringe (Hamilton, NV) at a rate of 0.1 μL/min with the needle in place for >5 min at each injection site. Animals were monitored regularly following recovery from surgery. Thirty days after injection, animals were sacrificed by overdose of isoflurane. After perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 70% ethanol (in 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), the brain was taken out and put in 70% ethanol (in 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C for post fixation. The fixed brain was then transferred to a PBS solution with 30% sucrose at 4°C until the tissue sank to the bottom, before being processed and embedded in O.C.T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature) compound. Coronal brain sections of 30 μm thickness were collected onto glass slides by cryo-sectioning before being utilized for immunohistochemical experiments.
For immunohistochemical study of α-Syn aggregation, the brain slices were blocked in 8% goat serum supplemented with 0.3% Triton-X 100 for one hour at room temperature before being incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies [α-Syn phospho S129 (EP1536Y), ab51253, Abcam, 1:3,000]. The brain slices were then washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The puncta number and area of α-Syn aggregations in brain slices were quantified by the Fiji/ImageJ software. The images were evaluated by the Analyze Particle function of Fiji/ImageJ to get a readout of puncta counts and area. Puncta sizes between 6.4-256 μm 2 were included.
Data are presented as mean ± SEM (standard error). When box plots were used, the box represents the 25–75% range, with the solid line within them indicating the mean level and the dashed line indicating the median level. The whiskers represent the SD and all points outside the standard deviation are shown as individual dots.
For experiments with only two groups, Student’s t test was used to check the significance, while for the experiments with more than two groups and multi-testing was required, one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s test was adopted to reduce the type 1 error and obtain adjusted p value. Significance is indicated as NS (not significant), ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗ p < 0.001.
For experiments with large sample size, effect size between groups was calculated (Cohen’s d ). The effects are defined as no effect ( d < 0.25), small effect (0.25 < d < 0.5), medium effect (0.5 < d < 0.75), and large effect ( d > 0.75).
