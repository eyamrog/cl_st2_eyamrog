Title: Structure and gating mechanism of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor


Abstract: Summary

The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor plays critical roles in the central nervous system and in the cholinergic inflammatory pathway. This ligand-gated ion channel assembles as a homopentamer, is exceptionally permeable to Ca 2+ , and desensitizes faster than any other Cys-loop receptor. The α7 receptor has served as a prototype for the Cys-loop superfamily yet has proven refractory to structural analysis. We present cryo-EM structures of the human α7 nicotinic receptor in a lipidic environment in resting, activated, and desensitized states, illuminating the principal steps in the gating cycle. The structures also reveal elements that contribute to its function, including a C-terminal latch that is permissive for channel opening, and an anionic ring in the extracellular vestibule that contributes to its high conductance and calcium permeability. Comparisons among the α7 structures provide a foundation for mapping the gating cycle and reveal divergence in gating mechanisms in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily.

Section: Introduction

The α7 nicotinic receptor functions as a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel and plays diverse signaling roles in human physiology. In the central nervous system, α7 is usually found pre- or peri-synaptically. There it serves a largely modulatory function rather than directly mediating fast chemical neurotransmission like other Cys-loop receptor superfamily members ( Berg and Conroy, 2002 8.

Deficits in α7 function are linked to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia ( Freedman et al., 1997 27. Freedman, R. ∙ Coon, H. ∙ Myles-Worsley, M. ...

In the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, binding of ligands to α7 reduces inflammation ( Wang et al., 2003 95. Wang, H. ∙ Yu, M. ∙ Ochani, M. ...

Immunol. 2020; 11 :1359 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In lung cell carcinoma, nicotine binding to α7 induces proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis ( Wang and Hu, 2018 93. Wang, S. ∙ Hu, Y. α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in lung cancer Oncol. Lett. 2018; 16 :1375-1382 PubMed Google Scholar ).
The physiological roles of α7 are linked to its pharmacological and biophysical properties. It is the only nicotinic receptor to assemble physiologically as a homopentamer. α7 has relatively low affinity for the classic agonists acetylcholine and nicotine and desensitizes much faster than other nicotinic receptor subtypes, a feature that may be balanced by its higher relative calcium ion permeability ( Castro and Albuquerque, 1995 12.

J. 1995; 68 :516-524 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Séguéla et al., 1993 83. Séguéla, P. ∙ Wadiche, J. ∙ Dineley-Miller, K. ... Molecular cloning, functional properties, and distribution of rat brain alpha 7: a nicotinic cation channel highly permeable to calcium J. Neurosci. 1993; 13 :596-604 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The influx of calcium through α7 is associated with activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels in neurons ( Dajas-Bailador et al., 2002 19. Dajas-Bailador, F.A. ∙ Mogg, A.J. ∙ Wonnacott, S. Intracellular Ca2+ signals evoked by stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in SH-SY5Y cells: contribution of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ stores J. Neurochem. 2002; 81 :606-614 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ) and stimulation of anti-inflammatory pathways in the immune system ( Zdanowski et al., 2015 104. Zdanowski, R. ∙ Krzyżowska, M. ∙ Ujazdowska, D. ... Role of α7 nicotinic receptor in the immune system and intracellular signaling pathways Cent. Eur. J. Immunol. 2015; 40 :373-379 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rapid desensitization of α7 prevents excess calcium from entering the cells and allows fine-tuning of neuronal activity ( Bouzat et al., 2008 10. Bouzat, C. ∙ Bartos, M. ∙ Corradi, J. ... The interface between extracellular and transmembrane domains of homomeric Cys-loop receptors governs open-channel lifetime and rate of desensitization J. Neurosci. 2008; 28 :7808-7819 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we present structures of the α7 nicotinic receptor in three conformational states: a resting-like closed-channel state in complex with the antagonist α-bungarotoxin (α-bgt), an activated, open-channel state stabilized by the agonist epibatidine and the positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596, and a desensitized, closed-channel state in complex with epibatidine alone. These structures provide a framework for probing α7’s unique biophysical and pharmacological properties and allow us to compare the gating mechanism of α7 with those in other Cys-loop receptors. We identify a structural element at the C terminus that we call the “latch” and pinpoint residues in this substructure required for coupling ligand binding to channel gating. We further discover an anionic residue in the extracellular domain required for the high unitary conductance and calcium permeability seen in α7 nicotinic receptors. Finally, we observe a structural interaction that may contribute to rapid desensitization inherent to α7.
Our structural understanding of gating mechanisms in Cys-loop receptors is far from complete. Mammalian Cys-loop receptors include the cation-selective nicotinic and 5-HT 3 receptors and the anion-selective GABA A and glycine receptors ( Gharpure et al., 2020 33. Gharpure, A. ∙ Noviello, C.M. ∙ Hibbs, R.E. Progress in nicotinic receptor structural biology Neuropharmacology. 2020; 171 :108086 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nemecz et al., 2016 68.

Emerging Molecular Mechanisms of Signal Transduction in Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channels Neuron. 2016; 90 :452-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like most ligand-gated ion channels, Cys-loop receptors cycle among three major conformational states: an apo closed-channel resting state, an agonist-bound open-channel activated state, and an agonist-bound closed-channel desensitized state. To date, high-resolution structures of nicotinic receptors have only been obtained in desensitized and resting-like states ( Gharpure et al., 2019 32. Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Zhuang, Y. ...

Among Cys-loop receptors, only the anion-selective glycine receptor has been structurally characterized in the principal gating cycle conformations ( Du et al., 2015 24. Du, J. ∙ Lü, W. ∙ Wu, S. ...

The 5-HT 3 family lacks a structural reference for a desensitized state and the two published open states are markedly different from each other ( Basak et al., 2019 6.

As such, it is currently unclear whether gating mechanisms are conserved across the superfamily. This study on α7 provides structural touchstones for the gating cycle of the cationic branch of the superfamily. We find that conformational transitions underlying activation and desensitization in α7 diverge from those in the glycine receptor, suggesting distinct gating mechanisms in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily.

Section: Results and discussion

The homopentameric nature of the α7 nicotinic receptor made it a logical target for structural analysis. However, even after three types of heteropentameric nicotinic receptors were determined, α7 remained refractory to structure determination ( Gharpure et al., 2019 32.

Structural principles of distinct assemblies of the human α4β2 nicotinic receptor Nature. 2018; 557 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). We modified WT α7 as described in the STAR Methods and Figures S1 and S4 and performed whole-cell and cell-attached single-channel electrophysiology experiments to measure channel function ( Figures 1 A, 1B and S2 , refers to Figure 1 ). These experiments confirmed our electron microscopy (EM) α7 construct retains functional hallmarks of wild-type (WT) α7, including potentiation by PNU-120596 ( Figure S2 ). The single-channel conductance, though similar, was 14% higher for the EM construct.
We utilized high-affinity ligands to resolve different steps of the gating cycle by cryo-EM ( Table S1 , refers to Figures 1 , S3 , and S4 ). We selected the competitive antagonist α-bgt, which yielded a map with an overall resolution of 3.0 Å and a closed pore consistent with a resting state ( Figures 1 C and S3 A, refers to Figures 1 C and S4 A) ( Moore and McCarthy, 1995 63. Moore, M.A. ∙ McCarthy, M.P. Snake venom toxins, unlike smaller antagonists, appear to stabilize a resting state conformation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235 :336-342 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). A combination of ligands was required to obtain the structure of an activated, open-channel state ( Figure 1 D). Epibatidine, one of the most potent α7 agonists ( Gerzanich et al., 1995 31. Gerzanich, V. ∙ Peng, X. ∙ Wang, F. ... Comparative pharmacology of epibatidine: a potent agonist for neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48 :774-782 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 ( Hurst et al., 2005 42. Hurst, R.S. ∙ Hajós, M. ∙ Raggenbass, M. ... A novel positive allosteric modulator of the alpha7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: in vitro and in vivo characterization J. Neurosci. 2005; 25 :4396-4405 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) produced a map of the receptor with an open pore at an overall resolution of 2.7 Å ( Figures 1 D and S4 B, refers to Figure 1 D and Figure S3 B). Local resolution of this structure varied considerably between the extracellular domain (ECD), transmembrane domain (TMD), and intracellular domain (ICD) ( Figure S3 B, refers to Figures 1 D and S4 B). Epibatidine alone stabilized a desensitized state with an overall resolution of 3.6 Å and a closed pore ( Figures 1 E and S3 C, refers to Figures 1 E and S4 C).
The three receptor structures adopt an overall cylinder shape in the ECD and TMD, with an ICD that tapers to a blunt point at its intracellular end. Cation permeation occurs down through the extracellular vestibule and generally narrower TMD pore before exiting through lateral portals framed by the ICD. The overall architecture is consistent with known structures in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, though anion-selective family members lack the ICD elements seen in nicotinic and 5-HT 3 receptors. In the following sections, we first analyze architecture and conformational differences by receptor domain ( Figure S4 , refers to Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , S5 , and S6 ). We start with the ECD, where neurotransmitters and orthosteric ligands bind at subunit interfaces. We next move to the coupling region, which connects the ECD to the TMD, and test the functional role of the C-terminal latch. We then analyze conformational transitions in the TMD and ICD and functionally probe a determinant of ion permeation. Within each section, we explore interactions at the amino acid level that contribute to the receptor’s movements during the gating cycle, concluding with an overall structure-based gating mechanism.
We determined the structure of the α7 receptor bound to α-bgt to probe the structure of a resting channel state ( Figures 1 C and 2 A). α-Bgt is a venom component from Bungarus multicinctus , the Taiwanese banded krait. It contains three “fingers” formed by β-strands pinned together by five disulfide bonds. Finger II of α-bgt penetrates deeply into the neurotransmitter binding pocket ( Figure 2 A), with one flank against the complementary or (−) face of the binding site and the other against Loop C of the principal or (+) face. Loop C in turn nestles between fingers I and II of α-bgt. Among nicotinic receptors, only the α7 and muscle subtypes bind α-bgt. Comparison of the α7-α-bgt structure to recent structures of α-bgt bound to the Torpedo nicotinic receptor ( Rahman et al., 2020 77. Rahman, M.M. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Worrell, B.T. ... Structure of the Native Muscle-type Nicotinic Receptor and Inhibition by Snake Venom Toxins Neuron. 2020; 106 :952-962.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) or bound to a soluble α7-like ECD ( Huang et al., 2013 41. Huang, S. ∙ Li, S.X. ∙ Bren, N. ... Complex between α-bungarotoxin and an α7 nicotinic receptor ligand-binding domain chimaera Biochem. J. 2013; 454 :303-310 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) provides insight into interactions that confer toxin affinity and subtype selectivity ( Figures S5 A and S5B, refers to Figure 2 A). The toxin penetrates more deeply in the α7 neurotransmitter binding pocket than in that of Torpedo , due to the larger Loop F of Torpedo ( Figure S5 A, refers to Figure 2 A). At the tip of toxin finger II, bgtR36 and bgtF32 form a cation-π stack to which Y187 aligns in an edge-to-face orientation ( Figure 2 A). This Loop C tyrosine is essential for high binding affinity ( Huang et al., 2013 41. Huang, S. ∙ Li, S.X. ∙ Bren, N. ... Complex between α-bungarotoxin and an α7 nicotinic receptor ligand-binding domain chimaera Biochem. J. 2013; 454 :303-310 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the space between α-bgt fingers I and II, three residues, F186 and P193 from Loop C and G152 from Loop B, form a triad that confers toxin selectivity for α7 and muscle receptors ( Sine et al., 2019 84. Sine, S.M. ∙ Strikwerda, J.R. ∙ Mazzaferro, S. Structural basis for α-bungarotoxin insensitivity of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Neuropharmacology. 2019; 160 :107660 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). The α7 structure reveals an extensive hydrogen bond network between bgtQ71 and K191, E192, Y194, and G152 of the receptor that may further stabilize toxin binding. An N-linked glycan projects from N110 on the complementary subunit to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone of bgtS35, which also interacts electrostatically with Q116 of the receptor. Thus, the structure of the complex between α7 and α-bgt reveals interactions important for toxin affinity and subtype selectivity.
The activated and desensitized state structures of α7 are both bound by epibatidine and adopt similar conformations in the neurotransmitter binding pocket ( Figure 2 B). We discuss the higher-resolution activated-state co-complex with PNU-120596 here. Within the neurotransmitter binding pocket, Loops A–F contribute aromatic and/or hydrophobic residues that nestle small ligands. Comparisons of epibatidine-bound α7 to other agonist-bound nicotinic receptors, such as α4β2 and α3β4 ( Figures S5 C–S5E, refers to Figure 2 ), show that positions of conserved aromatic residues are maintained. However, the bridged, basic nitrogen in epibatidine orients away from W148 on loop B and instead positions to form a cation-π interaction with the second tyrosine on loop C (Y194). This finding is consistent with unnatural amino acid substitutions, which showed that unlike most agonists bound to nicotinic receptors, epibatidine is predicted to form a strong cation-π interaction with Y194 and not with W148 ( Puskar et al., 2011 75. Puskar, N.L. ∙ Xiu, X. ∙ Lester, H.A. ... Two neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, alpha4beta4 and alpha7, show differential agonist binding modes J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :14618-14627 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiu et al., 2009 98. Xiu, X. ∙ Puskar, N.L. ∙ Shanata, J.A. ... Nicotine binding to brain receptors requires a strong cation-pi interaction Nature. 2009; 458 :534-537 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). The conformational transition of the ECD from the resting state to the activated state involves closure of Loop C, as well as a larger-scale twist of the whole β sandwich ( Video S1 ). This twist is counterclockwise around an axis approximately normal to the membrane, which contributes to Loop C closure. A tilting of the apex of the ECD toward its complementary subunit adds to the twist; these conformational changes propagate toward the membrane. The conformational transition in the ECD from activated to desensitized involves a subtle global expansion of that domain ( Video S2 ).

The movement of the ECD induced by agonist binding results in a reorganization of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in the coupling region at the ECD-TMD junction ( Figure 3 ; Video S1 ). On the vestibule or channel-axis side of the coupling region, the β1-β2 loop and the β8-β9 loop form a subunit interface that changes binding partners during the gating cycle. The eponymous Cys-loop forms a hub connecting all coupling region elements, from the ECD vestibule loops to the M2-M3 loop of the TMD to the peripheral C-terminal latch. The flexible linker between β10 and the M1 helix, known as the pre-M1 linker, is positioned at the periphery of the receptor, where it also participates in coupling. Alignments and locations of the loops and linkers that compose the coupling region are shown in Figures 3 and S4 .
The vestibule side of the coupling region exerts direct effects upon the transmembrane pore during the gating cycle. In the resting state, K45 in the β1-β2 loop forms an inter-subunit salt bridge with E172 in the β8-β9 loop ( Figure 3 B). This contact is severed by the ECD tilt that occurs during activation and remains severed in desensitization. The K45 side chain liberated during activation pivots with its β1-β2 loop to form an intra-subunit interaction with the carbonyl oxygens of M260 and A257 at the extracellular end of M2 ( Figure 4 C; Video S5 ). This helical capping remains intact during desensitization and may play a role in maintaining the extracellular end of M2 in a more open conformation during desensitization ( Figure 4 C; Video S5 ). The importance of these coupling region interactions is underscored by mutations of K45 or E172 that abolish channel opening ( Sala et al., 2005 81. Sala, F. ∙ Mulet, J. ∙ Sala, S. ...

Functional Impact of 14 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Causing Missense Mutations of Human α7 Nicotinic Receptor PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0137588 PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, we observed a strong ball-shaped density coordinated by four carboxylate-containing side chains in the coupling region of each subunit: D41, E43, and E44 from the β1-β2 loop and E172 from β8-β9 ( Figures 3 B–3D). We modeled these densities as Ca 2+ due to the strongly negative electrostatic environment and roles of E44 and E172 in the effects of Ca 2+ on α7 agonist affinity and potentiation ( Galzi et al., 1996 29. Galzi, J.L. ∙ Bertrand, S. ∙ Corringer, P.J. ... Identification of calcium binding sites that regulate potentiation of a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor EMBO J. 1996; 15 :5824-5832 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). The five putative Ca 2+ densities are present in all structures but are most prominent in the activated state.

A triad of electrostatic interactions provides architectural stabilization present in all three conformational states: D137 of the Cys-loop forms a salt bridge with the conserved R205 of the pre-M1 linker, which in turn forms a salt bridge with the same E44 that contributes to the Ca 2+ site ( Figures 3 C and 3D; Galzi et al., 1996 29.

J. 2013; 104 :355-367 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). During activation, V131 of the Cys-loop shifts to make hydrophobic interactions with M260 in the M2-M3 loop. During desensitization, this interaction is maintained and may also contribute to keeping the extracellular end of M2 more open in concert with the K45-M2 helix capping.
The periphery of the coupling region is coordinated by interactions between the pre-M1 linker, the Cys-loop, and a C-terminal latch that follows M4. The extracellular C termini of Cys-loop receptors are poorly conserved in sequence ( Figure 3 A) and are usually structurally disordered. The α7 receptor cryo-EM maps revealed that just after M4 exits the membrane, the helical structure breaks and makes a 90° turn. It then forms a short C-terminal amphipathic helix running parallel to the membrane. We call the sub-structure encompassing the C-terminal cap of M4, the 90° turn, and the following helix “the latch” as it fastens the C terminus to the coupling region.
The Cys-loop-latch interactions change dramatically during the gating cycle ( Figures 3 B–3D). In the resting state, W133 of the Cys-loop interacts with P468 of the latch via CH-π interactions; this corresponds to an interaction proposed between F167 and P617 in the α4 subunit (α4P617 corresponds to α7 S466 in Figure 3 A) that is associated with allosteric potentiation ( Deba et al., 2018 23. Deba, F. ∙ Ali, H.I. ∙ Tairu, A. ... LY2087101 and dFBr share transmembrane binding sites in the (α4)3(β2)2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :1249 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). W133 is stabilized on its other side by cation-π interactions with R132. In the middle of the latch helix, F470 forms aromatic interactions with F136, which is part of the Cys-loop FPF motif ( Jha et al., 2007 43. Jha, A. ∙ Cadugan, D.J. ∙ Purohit, P. ... Acetylcholine receptor gating at extracellular transmembrane domain interface: the cys-loop and M2-M3 linker J. Gen.

Binding to gating transduction in nicotinic receptors: Cys-loop energetically couples to pre-M1 and M2-M3 regions J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :3189-3199 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). The backbone carbonyl of F136 also makes an electrostatic contact with N469 of the latch in the resting state. During activation, the Cys-loop responds by moving away from the complementary subunit in the interface. This transition disrupts interactions between the Cys-loop and the latch; A467 forms weaker hydrophobic interactions with W133 in place of P468, and R132 rotates down to cap the M3 helix. During desensitization, the Cys-loop moves back toward its position in the resting state, reestablishing the strong hydrophobic interactions with the C-terminal latch. Unsurprisingly, all of the residues of the Cys-loop mentioned here have been implicated in achieving maximal response to agonists ( Aldea et al., 2007 2. Aldea, M. ∙ Mulet, J. ∙ Sala, S. ...

Chem. 2011; 286 :25331-25340 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Toward the end of the latch, there is a hydrophobic interaction between L208 of the M1 helix and F470 of the latch that appears to be maintained in all states. This latter interaction is intriguing, as mutation of the corresponding leucine in the muscle nicotinic receptor subunits increased open-channel dwell times ( Lee et al., 2009 52.

The pre-M1 linker is the final component of the coupling region and comprises a trio of consecutive arginines (R204–R206) that play distinct roles during activation ( Alves et al., 2011 3.

Functional Impact of 14 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Causing Missense Mutations of Human α7 Nicotinic Receptor PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0137588 PubMed Google Scholar ). R204 orients to form an electrostatic interaction with D477 near the end of the latch; this contact is disrupted during activation and then restored during desensitization. R205 is a major contributor to architectural stability, as noted above, and is the most conserved of the triad. It interacts with three anionic residues (E44, E172, and D137). These contacts are part of the principal coupling pathway and are required for efficient activation ( Mukhtasimova and Sine, 2013 67. Mukhtasimova, N. ∙ Sine, S.M. Nicotinic receptor transduction zone: invariant arginine couples to multiple electron-rich residues Biophys. J. 2013; 104 :355-367 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ); the structures show that the contacts with E44 and D137 are maintained in the resting, active, and desensitized states. Finally, R206 forms a strong electrostatic interaction with D265 of the M2-M3 loop of the neighboring subunit during activation ( Figure 3 C). As mutation of D265 is known to abolish channel activity, this inter-subunit interaction may contribute to efficient channel gating ( Campos-Caro et al., 1996 11. Campos-Caro, A. ∙ Sala, S. ∙ Ballesta, J.J. ... A single residue in the M2-M3 loop is a major determinant of coupling between binding and gating in neuronal nicotinic receptors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To investigate the functional significance of the Cys-loop-latch interaction, we designed point mutants and truncations and monitored assembly, trafficking, ligand binding, and macroscopic currents. We analyzed these mutations in WT α7 that has an M3-M4 loop YFP insertion ( Wang et al., 2014 96. Wang, Y. ∙ Xiao, C. ∙ Indersmitten, T. ... The duplicated α7 subunits assemble and form functional nicotinic receptors with the full-length α7 J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :26451-26463 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) to rapidly screen for assembly by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography ( Kawate and Gouaux, 2006 44. Kawate, T. ∙ Gouaux, E. Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography for precrystallization screening of integral membrane proteins Structure. 2006; 14 :673-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assayed total expression by binding to radiolabeled epibatidine, which can cross the cell membrane. Cell-surface expression was measured by binding of radiolabeled α-bgt, which cannot cross the membrane. We tested responses to nicotine alone, and nicotine + PNU-120596, via whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Finally, we performed radioligand binding assays measuring the ability of acetylcholine to compete against α-bgt binding. The results are discussed below and summarized in Table S2 .
We made six C-terminal truncations and five point mutations for residues on both sides of the Cys-loop-latch interaction ( Figure S1 B; Table S2 , both refer to Figure 3 ). Mutation of P468 to alanine or deletion of A467 abolished function of the α7 nicotinic receptor without a loss of expression or trafficking to the cell surface. Binding analysis of P468A and ΔA467 revealed decreases in both agonist affinity and Hill slope ( Table S2 , last two columns). The P468A mutant was shown to be functional in previous work done in the context of a pore mutation that slows desensitization and increases open-channel probability ( da Costa Couto et al., 2020 17. da Costa Couto, A.R.G.M. ∙ Price, K.L. ∙ Mesoy, S. ... The M4 Helix Is Involved in α7 nACh Receptor Function ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2020; 11 :1406-1412 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results are consistent with P468 and A467 in the latch turn being essential for coupling agonist binding to channel gating; when the energetic barrier to gating is lowered, the loss of function can be overcome ( Zhang et al., 2011 106. Zhang, J. ∙ Xue, F. ∙ Whiteaker, P. ... Desensitization of alpha7 nicotinic receptor is governed by coupling strength relative to gate tightness J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :25331-25340 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Replacement of the α7 C-terminal helix (all residues after P468) with the α4 subunit C terminus prevented pentamer formation ( Figure S1 B, refers to Figure 3 and Table S2 ), suggesting a role for the C-terminal latch in assembly. Indeed, replacement of the C-terminal helix of α7 with the eight amino acid Strep-tag diminished pentamer expression, while removal of the affinity tag, as well as all amino acids following the P468 turn, resulted in functional receptors and relieved the block on expression (ΔC4 in Table S2 removes all of the C terminus after P468). Surprisingly, if P468 in the latch turn and its preceding sequence are maintained, the following C-terminal helix appears dispensable for function.
To visualize movements of the TMD during the gating cycle, we first aligned the models globally and conducted structural comparisons ( Figure 4 A; Videos S1 , S3 , and S4 ). Map and model comparisons suggest that the M1, M3, and M4 helices tilt in concert during activation. To quantify large movements that give rise to activation and desensitization, we aligned the maps of individual subunits by their ECD to observe relative displacements in the TMD ( Figure 4 B). We then measured the tilt angle of each helix individually relative to the membrane normal (see STAR Methods ). While approximate, the measurements revealed important trends. M1, M3, and M4 tilt from 8° in the resting state to 25° in the activated state and then relax to 15° in the desensitized state ( Figure 4 B; Video S3 ). The influence of the coupling region during these movements affects both M1, which is pushed by the pre-M1 linker, and M4, which tracks the Cys-loop position through its interaction with the latch. During activation, the TMD tilt results in M4 sliding up four residues, or approximately one helical turn, along M3 ( Video S3 ). The consequence of this bundle tilt and M4 slide is a shift of the tethered M2 helix away from the central axis, opening the pore ( Video S4 ).

The M2 helix movements are regulated by interactions at its intracellular and extracellular ends. At the intracellular end, a strong intramembrane salt bridge between K238 on M2 and D445 on M4 is maintained in all three conformations, linking the movement of these helices ( Figure 4 C). D445 and the corresponding residue from the 5-HT 3A receptor were shown to be important for assembly ( da Costa Couto et al., 2020 17. da Costa Couto, A.R.G.M. ∙ Price, K.L. ∙ Mesoy, S. ...

Neurosci. 2019; 10 :3167-3172 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tilting of the M1-M3-M4 bundle during activation pulls M2 outward via the M2-M4 salt bridge. The extracellular end of M2 is secured in the activated and desensitized states through its intra-subunit interaction with K45 of the β1-β2 loop ( Figures 3 C, 3D, and 4 C; Video S5 ). The intracellular end of M2 moves inward during desensitization, tracking the other helices of the TMD in returning to a more resting-like conformation. The M2 capping interaction with the β1-β2 loop remains intact ( Figure 4 C), preventing closure of the extracellular end of M2 until agonist leaves the binding pocket, allowing the ECD to rotate back to its resting position.

The TMD is directly connected to the ICD via the M3 and M4 helices. The ICD comprises two helices per subunit, not conserved in anionic Cys-loop receptors, termed MX and MA, connected by a large disordered loop ( Figure S4 , refers to Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , S5 , and S6 ). The ICD is involved in protein expression and trafficking ( Rudell et al., 2014 80. Rudell, J.C. ∙ Borges, L.S. ∙ Rudell, J.B. ...

Identification of sequence motifs that target neuronal nicotinic receptors to dendrites and axons J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :9780-9793 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cytosolic apex of MA acts as a structural anchor for the ICD and contains residues important for upregulation of α7 by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins ( Dawe et al., 2019 22.

The ICDs in cation-conducting members of the Cys-loop superfamily are also involved in tuning conductance ( Gharpure et al., 2019 32. Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Zhuang, Y. ...

In the resting and desensitized states, the ICD MX and MA helices adopt conformations similar to those in the resting state of the Torpedo receptor and the desensitized state of α3β4 ( Gharpure et al., 2019 32. Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Zhuang, Y. ...

During activation, however, the upward shift of the M4 helix places a strain on the MA helix, resulting in a partial unwinding at the MA-M4 junction ( Figure S4 B, refers to Figure 1 D; Video S3 ). This shift in M4 was also seen with 5-HT 3A receptors ( Basak et al., 2018a 4. Basak, S. ∙ Gicheru, Y. ∙ Rao, S. ... Cryo-EM reveals two distinct serotonin-bound conformations of full-length 5-HT 3A receptor Nature. 2018; 563 :270-274 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Polovinkin et al., 2018 74. Polovinkin, L. ∙ Hassaine, G. ∙ Perot, J. ... Conformational transitions of the serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor Nature. 2018; 563 :275-279 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). In sync with these changes, the M3-MX linker and MX helix tilt up into the inner leaflet of the membrane as well. These changes result in ion-conducting portals that are more widely open during activation and then constrict again during desensitization.
The permeation pathway in Cys-loop receptors extends from the vestibule of the ECD, to the intrinsic membrane channel of the TMD formed by the M2 helices, and through the lateral ICD portals. Examination of this pathway in the gating cycle steps revealed several surprising discoveries that were not predictable from homology modeling.
The α-bgt-bound α7 structure reveals a widely open ECD vestibule, 11.2 Å in diameter at its narrowest point. Within the extracellular half of the TMD a series of hydrophobic residues produces a constriction sufficiently narrow to prevent ion flux. This hydrophobic gate comprises residues on successive helical turns of M2 (16′ leucine, 13′ valine, and 9′ leucine; Figures 5 A and 5D; prime numbering refers to position above the cytosolic end of the pore). L9′ is highly conserved among eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors and is thought to form the resting-state gate ( Figure S6 A, refers to Figure 5 ; Labarca et al., 1995 50. Labarca, C. ∙ Nowak, M.W. ∙ Zhang, H. ... Channel gating governed symmetrically by conserved leucine residues in the M2 domain of nicotinic receptors Nature. 1995; 376 :514-516 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, both α7 and the Torpedo receptor are additionally constricted above L9′ at the 13′ and 16′ positions, similar to findings from simulations of the α4β2 nicotinic receptor ( Yu et al., 2019 102. Yu, R. ∙ Tae, H.S. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Molecular dynamics simulations of dihydro-β-erythroidine bound to the human α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Br. J. Pharmacol. 2019; 176 :2750-2763 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Early studies on residues lining the channel identified polar mutations at 9′, 13′, and 16′ that allow the receptor to adopt a “high-affinity open state” that desensitizes more slowly than the WT α7 receptor ( Bertrand et al., 1993 9.

Thus, the α7 + α-bgt structure represents a resting, activatable state in the α7 gating cycle.
The activated conformation of the receptor pore is also straightforward to interpret ( Figures 5 B and 5E). The diameter of the transmembrane pore near L9′ increases to 7.2 Å ( Figures 5 B and 5E), which is close to the 7.4 Å–8.4 Å range of open channel diameters estimated for muscle-type nicotinic receptors ( Cohen et al., 1992 14. Cohen, B.N. ∙ Labarca, C. ∙ Davidson, N. ... Mutations in M2 alter the selectivity of the mouse nicotinic acetylcholine receptor for organic and alkali metal cations J. Gen.

Pore size and negative charge as structural determinants of permeability in the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel Proc. Biol. Sci. 1992; 250 :11-17 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the side chain of L9′ is not well ordered in the activated state. We suspect L9′ rotates in and out of the pore during ion flux, as suggested by molecular dynamic simulations of the 5-HT 3A receptor ( Polovinkin et al., 2018 74. Polovinkin, L. ∙ Hassaine, G. ∙ Perot, J. ... Conformational transitions of the serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor Nature. 2018; 563 :275-279 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). The conformation of the M2 helices in the α7 activated-state structure more closely resembles that of the 5-HT 3A receptor 6HIN and glycine receptor 6UD3 than of the 5-HT 3A receptor 6DG8 (all assigned as open states; PDB accession codes indicated; Figure S6 B, refers to Figure 5 ). In the ECD, we were surprised to observe a constriction at the position of E97 (6.4 Å) that was narrower than that seen in the transmembrane pore. We examine the contributions of this residue to the α7 permeation pathway below.
The permeation pathway of the desensitized-state structure is not as constricted in the ECD as it is in the open state. Its TMD pore is funnel-shaped, with a polar constriction at the −1′ position at the intracellular end ( Figures 5 C and 5F). In addition to this constriction, which was observed in α3β4 and α4β2 ( Figure S6 C; Gharpure et al., 2019 32. Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Zhuang, Y. ... Agonist Selectivity and Ion Permeation in the α3β4 Ganglionic Nicotinic Receptor Neuron. 2019; 104 :501-511.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morales-Perez et al., 2016b 65.

Structural principles of distinct assemblies of the human α4β2 nicotinic receptor Nature. 2018; 557 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), the pore is partially constricted at the 9′ position ( Figure S6 C, refers to Figure 5 ). The channel diameter and hydrophobicity at L9′ present a potential barrier for hydrated cations. While the L9′ residue contributes to the resting gate in Cys-loop receptors studied so far, it contributes uniquely to the desensitization gate in α7; hydrophilic substitutions may destabilize both states, thus favoring the active state ( Revah et al., 1991 79. Revah, F. ∙ Bertrand, D. ∙ Galzi, J.L. ... Mutations in the channel domain alter desensitization of a neuronal nicotinic receptor Nature. 1991; 353 :846-849 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). As this constriction at L9′ is not seen in other desensitized-state structures, we suggest that one component of the uniquely rapid desensitization of α7 may involve partial closure of this L9′ gate, with additional contributions from the ECD ( Gay et al., 2008 30. Gay, E.A. ∙ Giniatullin, R. ∙ Skorinkin, A. ... Aromatic residues at position 55 of rat alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are critical for maintaining rapid desensitization J.

The interface between extracellular and transmembrane domains of homomeric Cys-loop receptors governs open-channel lifetime and rate of desensitization J. Neurosci. 2008; 28 :7808-7819 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A striking feature in the activated α7 structure is a 6.4 Å constriction in the ECD formed by the side chains of E97 ( Figures 5 B, 6 A, 6B, and S7 A, refers to Figures 5 and 6 ). E97 is not conserved; it is either an aspartate (in α9) or a glycine in all other nicotinic receptor α subunits. Mutation of this residue in the bovine α7 nicotinic receptor modestly decreased agonist binding and peak macroscopic current ( Criado et al., 2008 16. Criado, M. ∙ Mulet, J. ∙ Castillo, M. ... Interactions between loop 5 and beta-strand beta6′ are involved in alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors channel gating J. Neurochem. 2008; 104 :719-730 PubMed Google Scholar ). The preceding aspartate (D96) is highly conserved and contributes to ion selectivity in muscle nicotinic and 5-HT 3 receptors ( Hansen et al., 2008 38. Hansen, S.B. ∙ Wang, H.L. ∙ Taylor, P. ... An ion selectivity filter in the extracellular domain of Cys-loop receptors reveals determinants for ion conductance J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :36066-36070 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Livesey et al., 2011 55. Livesey, M.R. ∙ Cooper, M.A. ∙ Lambert, J.J. ... Rings of charge within the extracellular vestibule influence ion permeation of the 5-HT3A receptor J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 :16008-16017 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, in all three α7 structures, D96 is engaged in a strong electrostatic interaction with R98 ( Figures 6 B and 6D).
In the resting state, E97 forms an inter-subunit salt bridge with K124 ( Figures 6 B and 6D). Tilting of the ECD during activation ruptures this interaction, and E97 re-orients toward the central axis, ideally positioned to affect ion permeation. In the desensitized state, E97 resumes its interaction with K124. Thus, we sought to determine if E97 plays a role in the remarkably high calcium permeability of α7 ( Séguéla et al., 1993 83. Séguéla, P. ∙ Wadiche, J. ∙ Dineley-Miller, K. ... Molecular cloning, functional properties, and distribution of rat brain alpha 7: a nicotinic cation channel highly permeable to calcium J. Neurosci. 1993; 13 :596-604 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and whether it contributes to ion permeation.
To investigate contributions of E97 to calcium permeability, we measured current-voltage (IV) relationships and calculated reversal potentials for WT and mutant receptors at two different calcium concentrations ( Figures 6 E and 6F). At both concentrations, WT receptors exhibited higher reversal potentials than E97A, suggesting that the mutant was less permeable to calcium. We used the change in reversal potentials to calculate permeability ratios (P Ca 2+ / P K + ) and found that the E97A mutation resulted in a >75% reduction in calcium permeability. To further probe the effect of this mutation, we used a calcium-free extracellular solution and co-applied agonist/PAM with different concentrations of calcium ( Figure 6 E). In WT channels, the application of high calcium concentrations resulted in substantial channel block, an effect that was abolished by the E97A mutant ( Figure 6 G). Furthermore, the mutation E97A reduced the amplitudes of the unitary currents, corresponding to a decrease in conductance of 72% compared to WT ( Figure 6 H). Together, these experiments demonstrate that E97 facilitates access of both calcium and monovalent cations to the pore.
To test whether the narrowest constriction in the open channel is formed by E97, we measured IV relationships for both WT and the E97A mutant for a series of organic cations that varied in size ( Figure S7 , refers to Figure 6 ). For cations whose ionic diameters are predicted to be much smaller than the constriction seen at E97 ( Cohen et al., 1992 14. Cohen, B.N. ∙ Labarca, C. ∙ Davidson, N. ... Mutations in M2 alter the selectivity of the mouse nicotinic acetylcholine receptor for organic and alkali metal cations J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100 :373-400 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), there were no differences in reversal potential between WT and E97A receptors nor were there differences in the calculated permeability ratio of the test cations relative to K + ( Figures S7 C–S7E, refers to Figure 6 ). However, for larger cations with predicted diameters >6.4 Å, WT and E97A receptors showed qualitative differences ( Figures S7 F–S7H, refers to Figure 6 ). At low voltages, there was a distinct non-linearity in the IV relationship for WT that was less pronounced for the E97A mutant. While these experiments do not allow us to definitively conclude that E97 contributes to size discrimination in the α7 pore, they do further support the idea that this residue interacts with and modulates the permeation pathway.
Stepping back from the detailed atomic-scale interactions and how they reorganize during state transitions, here we summarize the large-scale changes in the basic gating cycle of α7. We encourage readers to view Videos S1 , S2 , and S5 , which illustrate the process more effectively than 2D images.
The agonist epibatidine binds to subunit interfaces in the α7 receptor ECD, which induces a closure of Loop C and a twisting of each subunit’s ECD β sandwich ( Figures 7 A and 7B). This twist combines with a tilting of the apex of each subunit toward its complementary neighbor. The overall effect is a more compact ECD, transitioning from resting to an activated state. The twist and tilt produce conformational changes in the coupling region at the ECD-TMD junction, forcing the hydrophobic TM helices to tilt in the plane of the membrane and M4 to slide along M3 ( Figure 7 B). The collective motions result in expansion of the TMD, with the M2 helices translating away from the channel axis to open the pore ( Figures 7 D and 7E). The slide of M4 causes a local unwinding of the helix at the M4-MA junction that is present only in the open state. ( Figure 7 B; Video S3 ). This partial unwinding at the M4-MA junction, reminiscent of a stretched spring, allows for widening of the intracellular portals through which ions permeate in the activated state.
α7 nicotinic receptors are unusual in that the open state is rarely populated in the presence of agonist. At the single channel level, channel openings appear as brief pulses with durations of several hundred microseconds flanked by much longer closed periods due to desensitization. Thus, the open state of α7 can be considered an unstable intermediate on the pathway toward desensitization. During desensitization, the TMD relaxes back partially toward a resting state-like conformation, with a return of the TM helices to a more vertical orientation in the membrane ( Figure 7 C). The unwound MA-M4 junction recovers its stable helical configuration. The cytosolic ends of M2 and M4 remain pinned together in all states in part by a conserved salt bridge ( Figure 4 C; Video S5 ), and as such, reorientation of the helices brings the cytosolic end of M2 toward the channel axis to form a desensitization gate ( Figure 5 F and 7 F). While the hydrophobic activation gate in the middle of the pore closes partially, the extracellular ends of M2 do not come together. A contact made during activation, between the β1-β2 loop and the M2M3 loop, remains intact during desensitization, holding the top of the pore open. The movements of the TMD push against the coupling loops, resulting in a slight expansion of the ECD in the desensitized state ( Video S2 ). This concerted conformational change may contribute to the increased affinity for agonists in the desensitized state ( Neubig et al., 1982 69. Neubig, R.R. ∙ Boyd, N.D. ∙ Cohen, J.B. Conformations of Torpedo acetylcholine receptor associated with ion transport and desensitization Biochemistry. 1982; 21 :3460-3467 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Transition to the resting state is favored by agonist dissociation and results in a further expansion of the ECD, unlocking of the β1-β2–M2M3 loop interaction, and closure of the extracellular half of the TMD pore.
Structural mapping of the α7 gating cycle provides an opportunity to delineate conserved versus divergent mechanisms among members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. While structures of invertebrate and mammalian Cys-loop receptors and prokaryotic receptor orthologs have been obtained in different conformations ( Nemecz et al., 2016 68. Nemecz, Á. ∙ Prevost, M.S. ∙ Menny, A. ... Emerging Molecular Mechanisms of Signal Transduction in Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channels Neuron. 2016; 90 :452-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), only the α1 glycine receptor has been characterized in resting, activated, and desensitized states, and notably, the recent structures are in lipid nanodiscs ( Kumar et al., 2020 49. Kumar, A. ∙ Basak, S. ∙ Rao, S. ... Mechanisms of activation and desensitization of full-length glycine receptor in lipid nanodiscs Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3752 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2021 103. Yu, J. ∙ Zhu, H. ∙ Lape, R. ... Mechanism of gating and partial agonist action in the glycine receptor Cell. 2021; 184 :957-968.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). The results on α7 support a broadly conserved structural observation that the extracellular domain becomes more compact during activation, and this compact ECD is largely maintained in desensitized states ( Nemecz et al., 2016 68. Nemecz, Á. ∙ Prevost, M.S. ∙ Menny, A. ... Emerging Molecular Mechanisms of Signal Transduction in Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channels Neuron. 2016; 90 :452-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, comparison of α7 with the glycine receptor reveals a striking divergence in the nature of TMD conformational changes. The dramatic tilting of the α7 helical bundle and sliding of M4 are absent in the glycine receptor. In contrast, the conformational changes leading to glycine receptor channel opening appear as a more subtle subunit TMD twist and tilt outward. Desensitization of the glycine receptor involves a conformational change localized principally to the cytosolic end of the pore to close the gate at the −2′ position only ( Kumar et al., 2020 49. Kumar, A. ∙ Basak, S. ∙ Rao, S. ... Mechanisms of activation and desensitization of full-length glycine receptor in lipid nanodiscs Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3752 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2021 103. Yu, J. ∙ Zhu, H. ∙ Lape, R. ... Mechanism of gating and partial agonist action in the glycine receptor Cell. 2021; 184 :957-968.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The 5-HT 3 receptor provides another important point of comparison, as several full-length structures have been determined in different conformational states. A desensitized state for this receptor remains missing from the gating cycle ensemble, but resting, intermediate, and activated states have been determined by two groups ( Basak et al., 2018a 4. Basak, S. ∙ Gicheru, Y. ∙ Rao, S. ... Cryo-EM reveals two distinct serotonin-bound conformations of full-length 5-HT 3A receptor Nature. 2018; 563 :270-274 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018b 5. Basak, S. ∙ Gicheru, Y. ∙ Samanta, A. ... Cryo-EM structure of 5-HT 3A receptor in its resting conformation Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :514 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Polovinkin et al., 2018 74. Polovinkin, L. ∙ Hassaine, G. ∙ Perot, J. ... Conformational transitions of the serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor Nature. 2018; 563 :275-279 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). All 5-HT 3 receptor structures are in detergent, some with lipid additives. The resting to activated transition in 5-HT 3 reveals important consistencies with α7 in the TMD tilting and in the M4 helix sliding; these similarities between receptors that share just 26% amino acid sequence identity provide confidence that the rather dramatic changes we observe are physiologically meaningful. Functional analysis of 5-HT 3 further supports conservation in the observed widening of portals in the activated state ( Stuebler and Jansen, 2020 87. Stuebler, A.G. ∙ Jansen, M. Mobility of Lower MA-Helices for Ion Conduction through Lateral Portals in 5-HT 3A Receptors Biophys. J. 2020; 119 :2593-2603 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). While some aspects of the transition from resting to active appear conserved, the two open state structures for 5-HT 3 (PDB 6HIN and 6DG8 ) differ dramatically in the rotation of M2, the position of the pore constriction, and the position of the M2M3 loop. The α7 activated-state structure is similar to 6HIN but slightly wider in pore diameter.
These comparisons of cationic and anionic Cys-loop receptor structures reveal that the family does not share a single, conserved gating mechanism. The structural nexus of this mechanistic divergence may be the intracellular domain. The anion-selective glycine and GABA A receptors, and further, the invertebrate GluCl and the bacterial orthologs lack the MA and MX helices found in nicotinic and 5-HT 3 receptors ( Nemecz et al., 2016 68. Nemecz, Á. ∙ Prevost, M.S. ∙ Menny, A. ... Emerging Molecular Mechanisms of Signal Transduction in Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channels Neuron. 2016; 90 :452-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tight inter-subunit interactions at the cytosolic apex of MA in mammalian cation channels restrict the ability of M4 to rotate freely with the rest of the TMD bundle. M4 must then slide relative to M3 during channel activation and then relax back during desensitization.
We present here structures of the homopentameric human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the three foundational gating cycle conformations: a closed, resting state; an open, activated state; and a closed, desensitized state. In addition to providing touchstones for steps in the gating cycle, the structures generated hypotheses that we tested using electrophysiology and binding assays to understand channel function. We report a component located in the ECD that contributes to α7’s high calcium permeability and may regulate relative permeability in the broader Cys-loop receptor family. The discovery of the C-terminal latch expands the role of the C terminus in coupling agonist binding to channel opening. The presence of a hydrophobic constriction at the 9′ position of the pore in the desensitized state may contribute to the rapid onset of α7 desensitization. These provide insight into the gating cycle of nicotinic receptors, reveal how they contrast mechanistically with the glycine receptor, and open new paths of exploration to study this important family of signaling proteins.
Although we have determined a structural framework for understanding α7 nicotinic receptor gating and permeation, several outstanding issues remain; we highlight a few of interest to us here. First, the conformation observed in the presence of agonist and PNU-120596 is used as a proxy for the physiological open state of the receptor. This assumption was a necessary starting point as the open state is transient in the absence of the PAM; however, this conformation may not perfectly match the open state when only the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is bound. Second, any sample preparation introduces caveats in structural interpretation. In the case of α7, the receptor construct was modified to enable purification of enough stable sample for structural elucidation, and detergent was used during membrane extraction and purification. Third, despite including a high concentration of PNU-120596 in the cryo-EM sample, we were unable to confidently position this modulator, either in a proposed binding site in the TMD ( daCosta et al., 2011 18. daCosta, C.J. ∙ Free, C.R. ∙ Corradi, J. ... Single-channel and structural foundations of neuronal α7 acetylcholine receptor potentiation J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :13870-13879 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Young et al., 2008 101. Young, G.T. ∙ Zwart, R. ∙ Walker, A.S. ... Potentiation of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors via an allosteric transmembrane site Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :14686-14691 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ) or elsewhere. We suspect that the locally dynamic nature of the TMD in the activated state, which correlates with its lower local resolution, precludes visualization of the small molecule, similar to what was observed in a recent study of the 5-HT 3A receptor ( Polovinkin et al., 2018 74. Polovinkin, L. ∙ Hassaine, G. ∙ Perot, J. ... Conformational transitions of the serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor Nature. 2018; 563 :275-279 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lastly, while we identified functionally essential residues in the latch turn, the functional role of the C-terminal helix remains mysterious.

The human α7 receptor expression construct was modified from the CHRNA7-YFP plasmid deposited in Addgene by Henry Lester (plasmid #62630) ( Wang et al., 2014 96. Wang, Y. ∙ Xiao, C. ∙ Indersmitten, T. ... The duplicated α7 subunits assemble and form functional nicotinic receptors with the full-length α7 J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :26451-26463 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). This construct includes YFP inserted into a region of the M3-M4 loop predicted to be structurally disordered. For functional analyses including binding, trafficking, and whole-cell electrophysiology unless noted otherwise, mutations and deletions were made on this parent construct with the YFP present. In the optimized expression construct used for structural analysis, YFP and 42 ICD amino acids were replaced with the thermostable protein bRIL ( Chun et al., 2012 13. Chun, E. ∙ Thompson, A.A. ∙ Liu, W. ... Fusion partner toolchest for the stabilization and crystallization of G protein-coupled receptors Structure. 2012; 20 :967-976 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ), plus the linker sequence AGA ( Figures S1 and S4 , refer to Figures 1–7 ). Finally, the construct includes a Strep-tag II ( Schmidt and Skerra, 1994 82. Schmidt, T.G. ∙ Skerra, A. One-step affinity purification of bacterially produced proteins by means of the “Strep tag” and immobilized recombinant core streptavidin J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 676 :337-345 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) at its C terminus. This construct exhibited vastly improved biochemical behavior compared to the WT human receptor, and was sub-cloned into the pEZT-BM vector for small-scale transient transfection tests and large scale expression for purification ( Morales-Perez et al., 2016a 64. Morales-Perez, C.L. ∙ Noviello, C.M. ∙ Hibbs, R.E. Manipulation of Subunit Stoichiometry in Heteromeric Membrane Proteins Structure. 2016; 24 :797-805 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). The NACHO gene ( Gu et al., 2016 36. Gu, S. ∙ Matta, J.A. ∙ Lord, B. ... Brain α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Assembly Requires NACHO Neuron. 2016; 89 :948-955 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Matta et al., 2017 59. Matta, J.A. ∙ Gu, S. ∙ Davini, W.B. ... NACHO Mediates Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Function throughout the Brain Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :688-696 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) was similarly subcloned into pEZT-BM for expression. The Saposin A expression plasmid was provided by Salipro Biotech AB.
Bac-mam viruses were made in Sf9 cells ( Vaughn et al., 1977 89. Vaughn, J.L. ∙ Goodwin, R.H. ∙ Tompkins, G.J. ... The establishment of two cell lines from the insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae) In Vitro. 1977; 13 :213-217 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Viruses for the α7 receptor and NACHO were titered as previously described ( Morales-Perez et al., 2016a 64. Morales-Perez, C.L. ∙ Noviello, C.M. ∙ Hibbs, R.E. Manipulation of Subunit Stoichiometry in Heteromeric Membrane Proteins Structure. 2016; 24 :797-805 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, viruses were serially diluted by 10-fold and added to Sf9 cells in a 96-well plate. Cells were then incubated at 27°C for 48 h and examined by eye for GFP fluorescence on an inverted microscope. Each focal point of GFP positive cells is counted as one infectious unit, and titers are calculated by multiplying an average of three wells by the dilution factor. The α7 and NACHO viruses were transduced at an MOI of 1:1 into HEK293S GnTI - suspension cells ( Reeves et al., 2002 78. Reeves, P.J. ∙ Callewaert, N. ∙ Contreras, R. ... Structure and function in rhodopsin: high-level expression of rhodopsin with restricted and homogeneous N-glycosylation by a tetracycline-inducible N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative HEK293S stable mammalian cell line Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :13419-13424 Crossref Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ) at a density of 3-4 × 10 6 /mL. The cells were cultured at 37°C for 72 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were washed once in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride (TBS) and recentrifuged. After resuspension in TBS + 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Sigma), cells were lysed by passage through an Avestin Emulsiflex at 5,000-15,000 psi. Lysed cells were first centrifuged at low speed (10,000 g) to remove nuclei and unlysed cells, then centrifuged at 186,000 g for 2 h to pellet membranes. Membranes were stored at −80°C until used. To purify proteins, approximately 5 g of membranes were Dounce homogenized in TBS + 1 mM PMSF. The detergent n -dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM; Anatrace) was added to a final concentration of 40 mM, and solubilization was performed at 4°C while nutating. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 186,000 g for 40 min. The supernatant containing solubilized protein and its native lipids was bound to Strep-Tactin Superflow high capacity resin (IBA Life Sciences) via gravity flow. The resin was washed with TBS plus 1 mM DDM, supplemented with 10 μM Soy Polar Lipids (Avanti) and 0.25% w/vol cholesterol (Sigma) to promote receptor stability. The α7 receptor protein was eluted in the same wash buffer supplemented with 5 mM desthiobiotin (Sigma).
The α7 receptor protein was concentrated to ~500 μl, and then saposin ( Lyons et al., 2017 56. Lyons, J.A. ∙ Bøggild, A. ∙ Nissen, P. ... Saposin-Lipoprotein Scaffolds for Structure Determination of Membrane Transporters Methods Enzymol. 2017; 594 :85-99 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) and soy lipids/25% cholesterol (w/w) were added to the purified protein at a molar ratio of 1 α7 protein: 50 saposin protein: 230 lipid. This mixture nutated at 4°C for 30 min before the removal of detergent was begun by the addition of bio-beads. The removal of detergent was continued overnight at 4°C, after which incorporation was assayed by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography ( Kawate and Gouaux, 2006 44. Kawate, T. ∙ Gouaux, E. Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography for precrystallization screening of integral membrane proteins Structure. 2006; 14 :673-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). The receptor-lipidic disc mixture was further polished by size exclusion chromatography using only TBS as a mobile phase. The best fractions, as assessed by FSEC, were pooled and concentrated to ~4-6 mg/mL before addition of 200 μM α-bungarotoxin (Tocris) and subsequent freezing for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the case of the epibatidine dataset, 20 μM (±)-epibatidine (Tocris) was included throughout the purification along with 5 mM EGTA and increased to 200 μM epibatidine; otherwise all conditions were identical. For the epibatidine + PNU-120596 dataset, PNU-120596 was added at 50 μM during SEC and increased to 200 μM before freezing grids. No EGTA was present and an additional 5 mM CaCl 2 was included with the ligands.
For preparation of cryo-EM grids, 200-mesh Cu 1.2/1.3 grids from Quantifoil were glow-discharged in a PELCO easiGlow glow discharge apparatus for 30 mA/80 s on top of a metal grid holder (Ted Pella). To induce random particle orientations, protein was supplemented with 0.5 mM fluorinated fos-choline-8 (Anatrace) immediately before freezing. Grids were frozen with a Mark IV Vitrobot (FEI/ThermoFisher). Three μl of protein were applied to grids before blotting for 3.5 s at 100% humidity and 4°C. Frozen grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until used.
The electron microscopy was performed on a 300kV Titan Krios (FEI/Thermo-Fisher) equipped with a K3 direct electron detector and a GIF energy filter (20 e - V) using super-resolution mode (Gatan) and collected via SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 58. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (1746) PubMed Google Scholar ). The total dose was 36-86 e - /Å 2 . All data were processed within the Relion 3.0.8 suite of software ( Zivanov et al., 2018 109. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (1065) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the bungarotoxin dataset, 3,245 movies were collected and aligned with MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 108. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (1925) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed with GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 105. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autopicking was performed with Relion and yielded ~800,000 particles, which through iterations of 2D classification and 3D classification were pruned to 25,656 particles in the final refinement. These particles were polished and subjected to further rounds of refinement and beam-tilt refinement. The map was then subjected to B-factor sharpening in Relion, which produced a map with an overall resolution of 3.0 Å. However, this level of sharpening obscured the weaker density of the MX helix. The MX helix backbone was built using the unsharpened map. Local resolution was estimated using ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 48. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (913) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the epibatidine/PNU dataset, 16,745 movies were collected and aligned with MotionCor2 ( Li et al., 2013 54. Li, X. ∙ Mooney, P. ∙ Zheng, S. ... Electron counting and beam-induced motion correction enable near-atomic-resolution single-particle cryo-EM Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :584-590 Crossref Scopus (1141) PubMed Google Scholar ). After CTF estimation with GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 105. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (1262) PubMed Google Scholar ), particles were picked using crYOLO ( Wagner et al., 2019 91. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle box files were imported into Relion. After 2D and 3D classification and refinement, heterogeneity in the TMD required further classification with fine local angular searches to identify particles with strong density in the TMD. The final refinement used 710,549 particles from an original pool of 2,004,527 particles and reached an overall resolution of 2.7 Å. However, local resolution shows large differences between the ECD, which is closer to 2.5 Å, and the TMD, which is closer to 3.5 Å.
For the epibatidine dataset, 26,952 movies were collected and processed as per the epibatidine + PNU dataset. Several iterations of 3D classification with fine local angular searches were required to improve density of the M4 and MX helices, which appear to be the most mobile for this receptor. The final refinement was performed with only ~77,000 particles from a starting pool of ~1.8 million particles. We attempted to refine other 3D classes that had good signal for the ECD, but they did not lead to high resolution structures, or led to maps with no TMD visible. Nonetheless, the final map was estimated to be at a resolution of 3.77 Å in Relion, and further processing by density modification with the ResolveCryoEM program ( Terwilliger et al., 2020 88. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Ludtke, S.J. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Improvement of cryo-EM maps by density modification Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :923-927 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) improved the map quality and resolution to 3.6 Å. Structural biology applications used in this project were compiled and configured by SBGrid ( Morin et al., 2013 66. Morin, A. ∙ Eisenbraun, B. ∙ Key, J. ... Collaboration gets the most out of software eLife. 2013; 2 :e01456 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar )).
We generated an α7 receptor homology model as a starting point for manual building and refinement. We used PROMALS3D ( Pei et al., 2008 70. Pei, J. ∙ Kim, B.H. ∙ Grishin, N.V. PROMALS3D: a tool for multiple protein sequence and structure alignments Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :2295-2300 Crossref Scopus (811) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate a sequence alignment between α7 and the human α3 nicotinic receptor subunit ( Gharpure et al., 2019 32. Gharpure, A. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Zhuang, Y. ... Agonist Selectivity and Ion Permeation in the α3β4 Ganglionic Nicotinic Receptor Neuron. 2019; 104 :501-511.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) (RCSB 6PV7), then SWISS-MODEL ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 97. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (2701) PubMed Google Scholar ) to make the homology model of a single subunit. We expanded this α7 subunit into a pentamer model in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 26. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (13991) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting model was docked into the density map using Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 71. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (22100) PubMed Google Scholar ). The position of Loop C and the α-bungarotoxin molecule were copied from the α1 subunit of Torpedo ( Rahman et al., 2020 77. Rahman, M.M. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Worrell, B.T. ... Structure of the Native Muscle-type Nicotinic Receptor and Inhibition by Snake Venom Toxins Neuron. 2020; 106 :952-962.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). After initial real-space refinement was performed in Coot, further real space global refinement and B-factor refinement with stereochemistry restraints were performed in Phenix, with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints applied ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). Model validation was performed using MolProbity ( Davis et al., 2004 21. Davis, I.W. ∙ Murray, L.W. ∙ Richardson, J.S. ... MOLPROBITY: structure validation and all-atom contact analysis for nucleic acids and their complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 W615-9 Crossref Scopus (748) Google Scholar ).
Map quality varied by receptor domain in a state-dependent manner. For the resting state structure, as in one of the α subunits of the Torpedo receptor, the disulfide bond at the tip of Loop C is broken, likely due to radiation damage ( Hattne et al., 2018 40. Hattne, J. ∙ Shi, D. ∙ Glynn, C. ... Analysis of Global and Site-Specific Radiation Damage in Cryo-EM Structure. 2018; 26 :759-766.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rahman et al., 2020 77. Rahman, M.M. ∙ Teng, J. ∙ Worrell, B.T. ... Structure of the Native Muscle-type Nicotinic Receptor and Inhibition by Snake Venom Toxins Neuron. 2020; 106 :952-962.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agonist-bound structures the disulfide bond at the tip of Loop C appears to be protected from radiation damage by virtue of its interaction with agonist, analogous to its state-dependent protection from reducing reagents ( Damle and Karlin, 1980 20. Damle, V.N. ∙ Karlin, A. Effects of agonists and antagonists on the reactivity of the binding site disulfide in acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica Biochemistry. 1980; 19 :3924-3932 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The desensitized-state map showed stronger density in the ICD region, and we used this model as the starting point for the other structures. The MX helix and the flexible linkers on either side of it are more poorly resolved in the resting state, and we utilized an unsharpened map to model the helix. In the activated state, the unsharpened map allowed placing of the backbone of MA and MX; side chains of MA and MX are positioned as an average of possible conformations. Density likely corresponding to bRIL could be seen in unsharpened maps of the desensitized and resting-state complexes at high contour. However, it was not of sufficient quality to model the bRIL insertion.
Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from adherent HEK293S GnTI - cells transiently transfected with 0.4 μg NACHO and α7 DNA each at 37°C. 24 h post-transfection, cells were re-plated on 35 mm dishes and allowed to settle for 24 h. For all whole-cell recordings, borosilicate pipettes were used after being pulled and polished to an initial resistance of 2-4 MW. Recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, sampled at 10 kHz, low-pass filtered at 1kHz using a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices), and analyzed with pClamp 11 software (Molecular Devices). Solution exchange was done using a gravity-driven RSC-200 rapid solution changer (Bio-Logic).
To test for functionality of wild type, EM, and mutant constructs, the bath solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 4 MgCl 2 , 4 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, and 10 glucose. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 110 CsCl, 40 CsF, 10 EGTA, and 20 HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5. Cells were held at −75 mV and responses were evoked with either 100 μM nicotine or 2 μM epibatidine in the presence and absence of 3 μM PNU-120596. We noted a delay in trafficking of our EM construct to the cell surface for electrophysiology experiments; incubation of 1-2 days longer was required to obtain robust current responses from the EM construct.
To test for calcium permeability, the bath solution contained (in mM): 150 KCl, 5 or 20 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and 10 glucose. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 150 KCl, 10 EGTA, and 20 HEPES-KOH pH 7.4. Cells were initially held at −80 mV and responses were evoked with 100 μM nicotine and 3 μM PNU-120596. Once currents reached a steady state value, a voltage step protocol was applied by increasing the holding potential by 10 mV every 500 ms from −80 to +60 mV. Current amplitudes were normalized to the −80 mV value. Data points between −80 and +20 mV (due to non-linearity at higher voltages) were used to calculate reversal potentials using linear regression in Prism 8 (GraphPad). Reversal potentials are as follows: WT α7 (V rev 5mM = 3.36, n = 5, [95%CI = 1.93, 4.84]; V rev 20mM = 10.65, n = 5, [95%CI = 9.17, 12.20]). The E97A mutant (V rev 5mM = 1.97 [95%CI = 0.54, 3.47], n = 6; V rev 20mM = 4.49, [95%CI = 3.47, 5.53), n = 4).
To calculate relative calcium permeability (P Ca / P K ), the following equation derived from GHK was used, where R, T, and F are standard thermodynamic parameters, [K + ] o represents the extracellular K + activity, [Ca 2+ 5 ] o and [Ca 2+ 20 ] o represent extracellular Ca 2+ activities at 5 mM and 20 mM respectively (ionic activities were determined using the Debye–Hückel equation), and ΔV rev = V rev20 -V rev5 , where V rev20 and V rev5 represent the reversal potentials determined at 20 mM and 5 mM Ca 2+ respectively: P C a 2 + P K + = [ K + ] o ⁢ ( 1 − e Δ ⁢ V r e v ⁢ F / R T ) 4 ⁢ [ C a 2 + 5 ] o ⁢ e ( Δ ⁢ V r e v ⁢ F / R T ) ⁢ ( 1 + e V r e v 5 ⁢ F / R T ) − 1 − 4 ⁢ [ C a 2 + 2 0 ] o ⁢ ( 1 + e V r e v 2 0 / R T ) − 1

To test for calcium block, the bath solution contained (in mM): 150 KCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and 10 glucose. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 150 KCl, 10 EGTA, and 20 HEPES-KOH pH 7.4.

To test for organic cation permeability, the bath contained (in mM): 150 KCl (or 75 KCl and 75 of the chloride salt for the cation being tested), 10 HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and 10 glucose.

To calculate relative cation permeability ratios (P X /P K ), the following equation derived from GHK was used, where R, T, and F are standard thermodynamic parameters, [K + ] r represents the extracellular K + activity in the reference solution (150 mM KCl), [K + ] t represents the extracellular K + activity in the test solution (75 mM KCl and 75 mM test cation chloride), and X+ represents the extracellular activity of the organic cation in the test solution (ionic activities were determined using the Debye–Hückel equation), and ΔV rev = V t -V r , where V t and V r represent the reversal potentials for the test and reference solutions respectively: P X + P K + = [ K + ] r ⁢ ( 1 0 Δ ⁢ V r e v ⁢ F / R T ) − [ K + ] t [ X + ]

Recordings from BOSC-23 cells, transfected with cDNAs encoding the α7 AChR or mutants thereof, were obtained in the cell-attached patch configuration at a temperature of 21 °C. Patch pipettes were pulled from glass capillary tubes (No.7052, King Precision Glass) and coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning). The bath solution contained (in mM): 142 KCl, 5.4 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl 2 , 1.7 MgCl 2 , and 10 HEPES, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 by addition of KOH. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 142 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl 2 , 1.7 MgCl 2 , and 10 HEPES, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 by addition of NaOH. Acetylcholine chloride, with or without PNU-120596, was added to the pipette solution. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) with the gain set at 100 mV/pA and the internal Bessel filter at 100 kHz. Before establishing a cell-attached patch, the pipette offset potential was manually set to zero, and after forming a giga-ohm seal, a command voltage was applied to the interior of the patch pipette to establish the membrane potential. The current output was sampled at intervals of 0.2 μs using a National Instruments model BNC-2090 A/D converter with a PCI 6111e acquisition card and recorded to the hard disk of a PC computer using the program Acquire (Bruxton).
Single channel analysis was performed using the program TAC 4.2.0 (Bruxton). To determine the single channel current amplitude, the Gaussian digital filter within TAC was set at 5 kHz, an all-points histogram was generated for each sweep of data from a given patch, and two Gaussian functions, one for the baseline and the other for the open channel current, were fitted to the histogram. The difference between the means of the baseline and open channel currents yielded the current amplitude for each sweep. The current amplitude for at least twenty sweeps was averaged to yield the overall mean current amplitude. Currents are displayed in Figure 1 at a bandwidth of 10 kHz. To analyze single channel dwell times, histograms were plotted using a logarithmic abscissa and a square root ordinate, with a uniformly imposed dead time of 8 μs, and were fitted by the sum of exponentials by maximum likelihood using the program TACFit 4.3.3 (Bruxton).
BOSC-23 cells, transfected with cDNAs encoding the α7 AChR or mutants thereof, were harvested by gentle agitation, centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 1 min, and re-suspended in extracellular bathing solution containing (mM): 140 KCl, 5.4 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl 2 , 1.7 MgCl 2 , 25 HEPES, pH 7.4. The radioligands 125 I-epibatidine (2 nM; a generous gift by Dr. Vanda Lennon, Neuroimmunology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic) or 125 I-α-bgt (10 nM) (PerkinElmer) were added to replicate aliquots of cells, and after incubation for 45 min at 21 °C, bound radioligand was determined by filtration using a cell harvester. Specific binding was determined after subtracting the amount of radioligand bound to mock transfected cells. Triplicate measurements for each mutant were normalized to the mean value determined for wild type α7.
Binding of ACh was determined by competition against the rate of 125 I-α-bgt binding. Briefly, replicate aliquots of cells, two per ACh concentration, were incubated with a series of increasing concentrations of ACh for 30 min, 125 I-α-bgt (10 nM) was added, and after 10 min of incubation, radioligand bound to the cells was determined by filtration using a cell harvester. Under these conditions approximately 20% of the total sites were occupied by 125 I-α-bgt. After subtracting binding in the presence of 10 mM ACh, the ratio of binding in the presence of ACh divided by that in its absence, which equals 1-Fraction bound, was determined. The following form of the Hill equation was fitted to the data using non-linear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism: 1-Fraction bound = 1- [ACh] nH /([ACh] nH + K I nH ), where K I is the apparent dissociation constant and nH is the Hill coefficient.
UCSF Chimera was used to split and align maps in Figure 4 . First, each map was split based on the amino acids of a single subunit ECD (residues 1-204). This created a reference to align the ECD maps of each conformation. The single-subunit ECDs were fitted into the bungarotoxin map to align them. Then the original map was split into a single subunit map, which was then aligned with its partnered ECD map. The TMD maps displayed are thus aligned via their ECD and reflect movement of the TMD only relative to the ECD.
Tilt angles of the models shown in Figure 4 were measured by adding pointer atoms in a line perpendicular to the axis of each helix, in Coot. Then the angle was measured between this line and one from the upper pointer atom to a reference Cα position at the intracellular end of M3. For the nanodisc density shown in Figure 1 , the unsharpened maps were low-pass filtered to 8 Å using Relion image handler. To measure the diameter of the nanodisc, pointer atoms were placed at the edge of the low-pass filtered map in Coot, and the distance tool was used. PyMOL (Schrodinger), Chimera and ChimeraX were used to generate structural figures and ChimeraX was used to create the movies ( Pettersen et al., 2021 72. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Structure visualization for researchers, educators, and developers Protein Sci. 2021; 30 :70-82 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). CHAP was used to assess the hydrophobicity of the permeation pathway ( Klesse et al., 2019 47. Klesse, G. ∙ Rao, S. ∙ Sansom, M.S.P. ... CHAP: A Versatile Tool for the Structural and Functional Annotation of Ion Channel Pores J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431 :3353-3365 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) and HOLE was used to estimate pore diameters ( Smart et al., 1996 85. Smart, O.S. ∙ Neduvelil, J.G. ∙ Wang, X. ... HOLE: a program for the analysis of the pore dimensions of ion channel structural models J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 :354-360 376 Crossref Scopus (882) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the whole cell and single channel electrophysiology experiments, regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8, with error bars representing standard error of the mean and bracketed values indicating the 95% confidence interval. For the single channel experiments, individual recordings were analyzed in TAC to determine mean current at a given voltage before linear regression analysis of current amplitude versus voltage. Details of replicates are given in the individual methods section or figure legend, where n is the number of cells or patches that the measurements were taken from. For radioligand binding experiments to determine the total number of binding sites, specific binding was determined after subtracting the amount of radioligand bound to mock transfected cells, and details of the analysis and replicates are present in the individual methods section. For radioligand binding experiments to determine the apparent dissociation constant for ACh, data were analyzed by non-linear regression using Prism. All the values are included in the analysis. No methods were used to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach.
In Table S2 , ns is given for some mutants to indicate not significantly different from wild type. These were mutants for which an initial competition assay was done with a single determination per acetylcholine concentration. There was no statistical test of whether the mutants were different from wild type (the curves overlapped). However, for the three mutants for which we give Kd and nH values in the table, the initial assay revealed qualitative differences from wild type, and a subsequent assay was done with duplicate determinations of initial rate of binding for each ACh concentration, along with measurements of equilibrium binding to insure initial rate conditions were met. Results from these experiments are given in the table.
