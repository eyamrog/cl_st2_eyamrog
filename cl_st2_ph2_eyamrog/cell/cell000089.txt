Title: Heterochromatin-Driven Nuclear Softening Protects the Genome against Mechanical Stress-Induced Damage


Abstract: Summary

Tissue homeostasis requires maintenance of functional integrity under stress. A central source of stress is mechanical force that acts on cells, their nuclei, and chromatin, but how the genome is protected against mechanical stress is unclear. We show that mechanical stretch deforms the nucleus, which cells initially counteract via a calcium-dependent nuclear softening driven by loss of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. The resulting changes in chromatin rheology and architecture are required to insulate genetic material from mechanical force. Failure to mount this nuclear mechanoresponse results in DNA damage. Persistent, high-amplitude stretch induces supracellular alignment of tissue to redistribute mechanical energy before it reaches the nucleus. This tissue-scale mechanoadaptation functions through a separate pathway mediated by cell-cell contacts and allows cells/tissues to switch off nuclear mechanotransduction to restore initial chromatin state. Our work identifies an unconventional role of chromatin in altering its own mechanical state to maintain genome integrity in response to deformation.

Section: Introduction

Epithelial tissues are load-bearing elements that undergo large-scale, force-driven deformations ( Anlaş and Nelson, 2018; Jor et al., 2013 2. Anlaş, A.A. ∙ Nelson, C.M.

Med. 2013; 5 :539-556 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although accumulation of mechanical stress within tissues can compromise tissue integrity ( Casares et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2012 15. Casares, L. ∙ Vincent, R. ∙ Zalvidea, D. ...

USA. 2012; 109 :16449-16454 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ), epithelial sheets can sustain extreme deformation and mechanical stress without signs of damage ( Latorre et al., 2018; Le et al., 2016 39.

Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :864-875 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is in strong contrast to cancer cells, where mechanical deformations have been shown to induce nuclear rupture and DNA damage ( Denais et al., 2016; Raab et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2018 26.

Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :3796-3808 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is likely that noncancerous epithelial cells, such as skin epidermis stem/progenitor cells (EPCs) that are exposed to large-scale, dynamic mechanical forces in their natural microenvironment ( Maiti et al., 2016; Obropta and Newman, 2016 48.

Skin strain fields at the shoulder joint for mechanical counter pressure space suit development Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference. 2016; 1-9 Google Scholar ), have acquired robust mechanisms of genome mechanoprotection.
The nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope (NE), a double membrane continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The nuclear lamina, which underlies the NE, is composed of a meshwork of intermediate filament proteins called Lamins, and it functions as a structural and mechanical scaffold for the nucleus ( Gruenbaum and Foisner, 2015 30. Gruenbaum, Y. ∙ Foisner, R. Lamins: nuclear intermediate filament proteins with fundamental functions in nuclear mechanics and genome regulation Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84 :131-164 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nucleus is mechanically tethered to the extracellular environment, adhesion receptors, and the contractile cytoskeleton through adaptor-protein-mediated interactions at the NE. Additional protein interactions link chromatin to the nuclear lamina ( Buchwalter et al., 2019 13. Buchwalter, A. ∙ Kaneshiro, J.M. ∙ Hetzer, M.W. Coaching from the sidelines: the nuclear periphery in genome regulation Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 20 :39-50 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inside the nucleus, the genome is packaged and organized nonrandomly to ensure efficient gene expression silencing. The organized chromatin compartments adopt specific positions relative to the nuclear periphery, and a dense layer of heterochromatin can be found underneath the nuclear lamina of most mammalian cells ( Buchwalter et al., 2019; van Steensel and Belmont, 2017 13. Buchwalter, A. ∙ Kaneshiro, J.M. ∙ Hetzer, M.W. Coaching from the sidelines: the nuclear periphery in genome regulation Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 20 :39-50 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar 77. van Steensel, B. ∙ Belmont, A.S. Lamina-associated domains: links with chromosome architecture, heterochromatin, and gene repression Cell. 2017; 169 :780-791 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (638) PubMed Google Scholar ). These lamina-associated heterochromatin regions are characterized by low gene density, low transcriptional activity, and enrichment of repressive histone modifications H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 ( Buchwalter et al., 2019 13. Buchwalter, A. ∙ Kaneshiro, J.M. ∙ Hetzer, M.W. Coaching from the sidelines: the nuclear periphery in genome regulation Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 20 :39-50 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, disruption of methyltransferases that deposit H3K9me2 (Ehmt2/G9a) and H3K9me3 (Setdb1, Suv39H1, and Suv39H2) impair gene silencing and chromatin positioning at the lamina ( Bian et al., 2013; Nicetto et al., 2019; Yokochi et al., 2009 5.

USA. 2009; 106 :19363-19368 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recent work indicates that extrinsic microenvironment-derived forces are capable of deforming and remodeling chromatin to change global patterns of gene expression ( Miroshnikova et al., 2017 54. Miroshnikova, Y.A. ∙ Nava, M.M. ∙ Wickström, S.A. Emerging roles of mechanical forces in chromatin regulation J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :2243-2250 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, how mechanical stress is dissipated within the nucleus, and how chromatin responds to and is protected against mechanical stress, are less known. To identify such mechanisms and properties, we exposed EPC monolayers to increasing amplitudes of physiologically relevant cyclic, uniaxial mechanical stretch ( Liu et al., 2017; Wessendorf and Newman, 2012 45. Liu, X. ∙ Maiti, R. ∙ Lu, Z.H. ... New non-invasive techniques to quantify skin surface strain and sub-surface layer deformation of finger-pad during sliding Biotribology (Oxf.). 2017; 12 :52-58 Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar 82. Wessendorf, A.M. ∙ Newman, D.J. Dynamic understanding of human-skin movement and strain-field analysis IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 2012; 59 :3432-3438 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that stretch triggers immediate nuclear deformation that leads to Piezo1-mediated calcium release from the ER to reduce lamina-associated H3K9me3 heterochromatin and subsequent nuclear softening. Inhibiting calcium influx or increasing heterochromatin levels by forced expression of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase Suv39H1 results in failure to modify chromatin mechanics, triggering DNA damage. Long-term exposure to high-amplitude stretch leads to monolayer alignment perpendicular to stretch in a process independent of the nuclear deformation pathway and driven by cell-cell adhesion. This supracellular patterning is essential to redistribute mechanical stress away from the nucleus, allowing the cells to restore their steady-state nuclear and chromatin architecture for long-term mechanoprotection.

Section: Results

Quantification of EPC monolayer features in response to several uniaxial stretch amplitudes revealed gradual, time-dependent reorientation of filamentous actin (F-actin) and nuclei perpendicular to the direction of stretch ( Figures 1 A–1C) ( De et al., 2008; Faust et al., 2011; Noethel et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2001 25.

Specificity of endothelial cell reorientation in response to cyclic mechanical stretching J. Biomech. 2001; 34 :1563-1572 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ). Monolayer alignment was initiated at 30 min and completed at 360 min of continuous cyclic (100 mHz) 40% stretch ( Figure 1 B, 1C). In contrast, 5% stretch was insufficient to trigger alignment, even at longer timescales ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 A), whereas 20% stretch produced an intermediate phenotype ( Figure S1 B). The stretch-induced reorientation of nuclei was associated with increased nuclear aspect ratio and flattening ( Figures 1 D–1F), whereas nuclear volume was largely unaltered ( Figure S1 C). The supracellular monolayer reorganization also included reorientation of adherens junctions into a 45° angle to the stretch axis ( Figure 1 G).
Closer inspection of cytoskeletal architecture revealed F-actin specifically around the nucleus ( Figure 1 H). Intriguingly, although 5% stretch was not sufficient to induce F-actin alignment, this regime did trigger perinuclear actin polymerization. However, in contrast to 40% stretch, the perinuclear actin ring in the 5% condition persisted over time ( Figure 1 H), suggesting that perinuclear actin polymerization occurs faster and with lower stretch amplitude than supracellular alignment.
To dissect intracellular signaling dynamics that mediate the two distinct patterns of stretch responses, we performed phosphoproteomic analyses on cells exposed to 40% stretch for 30 and 360 min and identified 1,461 differentially regulated phosphosites ( Figure 1 I; Table S1 ). K-means clustering revealed dynamic, time-dependent regulation of the phosphoproteome, where the largest cluster of 410 phosphosites showed a transient downregulation at 30 min followed by full recovery at 360 min ( Figure 1 I, J). Intriguingly, among the most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms in this cluster were regulation of histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation (H3K9me2,3) ( Figure 1 K). These terms included altered phosphorylation of Lamins A, B1, and B2 and the H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1 ( Table S1 ). A second large phosphosite cluster that remained downregulated also at 360 min, corresponding to the dynamics of supracellular alignment, contained adhesion and actin regulators such as paxillin, cofilin, and myosin-9 ( Figure 1 J, K). In addition, both clusters contained hemidesmosome components such as integrin β4, collagen XVII, and plectin ( Table S1 ) ( Rottner et al., 2017; Walko et al., 2015 65. Rottner, K. ∙ Faix, J. ∙ Bogdan, S. ... Actin assembly mechanisms at a glance J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :3427-3435 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar 79. Walko, G. ∙ Castañón, M.J. ∙ Wiche, G. Molecular architecture and function of the hemidesmosome Cell Tissue Res. 2015; 360 :363-378 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Changes in cluster-specific temporal phosphorylation dynamics were validated by western blotting for representative proteins ( Figure S1 D).
As the phosphoproteome analysis implicated changes in H3K9me2,3, we next examined changes in constitutive heterochromatin ( Becker et al., 2016; Simon and Kingston, 2013 3. Becker, J.S. ∙ Nicetto, D. ∙ Zaret, K.S. H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin: barrier to cell fate changes Trends Genet. 2016; 32 :29-41 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Simon, J.A. ∙ Kingston, R.E. Occupying chromatin: Polycomb mechanisms for getting to genomic targets, stopping transcriptional traffic, and staying put Mol. Cell. 2013; 49 :808-824 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that both 40% and 5% stretch induced a strong reduction in H3K9me2,3 levels at 30 min ( Figures 1 L and S1 E). Separate analyses of H3K9 di- and trimethylation revealed alteration of both states ( Figures S1 F and S1G), with a more substantial effect on H3K9me3, leading us to focus on that modification. Similar to perinuclear actin polymerization, the decrease in H3K9me3 with 40% stretch was transient and reversed after 180–360 min of continuous stretch. In contrast, 5% stretch induced sustained H3K9me3 reduction ( Figure 1 L, S1 F and G). Consistent with the sustained heterochromatin and perinuclear actin changes in 5% stretch, the phosphorylation changes that were reversible in 40% remained downregulated in 5% stretch also at 360 min ( Figure S1 D).
Collectively, these data indicate that the EPC mechanoresponse under high-amplitude cyclic uniaxial stretch consists of a transient perinuclear actin, NE, and heterochromatin response and a slower, sustained supracellular alignment response. While low-amplitude cyclic stretch is insufficient to induce supracellular alignment, it triggers heterochromatin and NE changes, indicating distinct amplitude dependencies.
To characterize changes in H3K9me3-heterochromatin, we mapped genome-wide changes in H3K9me3 using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of cells stretched for 30 min at 40%. In addition, we generated corresponding RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets of cells stretched for 30 and 360 min at 40%. Consistent with the phosphoproteome and immunofluorescence data, we observed a substantial overall reduction in H3K9me3 occupancy, as defined by differential peaks (padj < 0.05; Figure 2 A; Table S2 ). Interestingly, reduced H3K9me3 occupancy was found particularly at non-coding regions, whereas the few regions with increased occupancy upon stretch were predominantly at protein-coding genes ( Figure 2 B). Reduced H3K9me3 occupancy was biased toward chromosome ends ( Figures 2 C and 2D), consistent with high H3K9me3 levels at subtelomeric regions ( Cubiles et al., 2018 23. Cubiles, M.D. ∙ Barroso, S. ∙ Vaquero-Sedas, M.I. ... Epigenetic features of human telomeres Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :2347-2355 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with their predominant location at non-coding regions, the stretch-regulated H3K9me3 peaks showed no substantial correlation with the stretch-regulated transcriptome ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, those few regions with increased occupancy overlapped with the transcriptome, with a corresponding decrease in transcript levels of genes with increased H3K9me3 occupancy ( Figure S2 A), as would be predicted from the repressive function of H3K9me3. Interestingly, these genes with reduced expression were particularly enriched on chromosome 19 ( Figure S2 B), which is found positioned centrally within the nucleus ( Croft et al., 1999 22. Croft, J.A. ∙ Bridger, J.M. ∙ Boyle, S. ... Differences in the localization and morphology of chromosomes in the human nucleus J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145 :1119-1131 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Detailed analysis of the transcriptome revealed that 480 genes were differentially expressed after 30 min of stretch (padj < 0.05), whereas 2,151 genes were altered after 360 min ( Figure S2 C; Table S3 ). Among the most enriched GO terms after 30 min were terms related to cell-cell junctions and the cytoskeleton ( Figure 2 F), consistent with the phosphoproteome data and onset of supracellular alignment. Heterochromatin regulation was the most enriched GO term at 360 min, with strong upregulation of genes related to the facultative heterochromatin mark H3K27me3, and its regulators such as JARID2 and SUZ12 ( Margueron and Reinberg, 2011 50. Margueron, R. ∙ Reinberg, D. The Polycomb complex PRC2 and its mark in life Nature. 2011; 469 :343-349 Crossref Scopus (2504) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 G and S2 C), whereas epidermal differentiation genes were among the most downregulated genes ( TGM1 , PPL , and SPRR ) ( Figures 2 G and S2 C). These results confirm our earlier work, where long-term (12 h) biaxial stretch was observed to decrease global transcription to increase H3K27me3-occupancy and silencing of epidermal differentiation genes ( Le et al., 2016 40. Le, H.Q. ∙ Ghatak, S. ∙ Yeung, C.Y.C. ... Mechanical regulation of transcription controls Polycomb-mediated gene silencing during lineage commitment Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :864-875 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, we detected reduced levels of the elongating form of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII-S2P) and increased H3K27me3 levels in response to long-term (6–24 h) stretch. This was particularly evident in 5% stretch conditions, where H3K27me3 did not return to steady state upon long-term stretch and differentiation gene expression remained suppressed ( Figures S2 D–S2F). In line with slower kinetics of H3K27me3 accumulation, ChIP-qPCR of selected chromatin regions with decreased H3K9me3 occupancy did not show corresponding increases in H3K27me3 at these sites after 30 min of 40% stretch ( Figure S2 G). Collectively, these experiments show that long-term uniaxial stretch, similar to biaxial stretch ( Le et al., 2016 40. Le, H.Q. ∙ Ghatak, S. ∙ Yeung, C.Y.C. ... Mechanical regulation of transcription controls Polycomb-mediated gene silencing during lineage commitment Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :864-875 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), triggers transcriptional repression, increased H3K27me3, and silencing of differentiation gene expression. These experiments further reveal that stretch rapidly triggers a widespread reduction in H3K9me3 occupancy, mainly at non-coding regions and chromosome ends, with little immediate transcriptional consequences, raising the question of the biological significance of this change.
To address the mechanisms and functional relevance of the force-induced reduction in H3K9me3, we further mined the phosphoproteome data and observed that a subset of phosphosites found downregulated upon stretch have been previously reported to be hyperphosphorylated during NE mitotic breakdown, most prominently phosphorylation of Lamin A at S22 and S329 ( Güttinger et al., 2009 32. Güttinger, S. ∙ Laurell, E. ∙ Kutay, U. Orchestrating nuclear envelope disassembly and reassembly during mitosis Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 :178-191 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 A), prompting us to examine the NE. Although mitotic frequency was unaltered ( Figure S3 B), we observed increased NE wrinkling with moderate but sustained effect with 5% stretch and a strong but transient change using 40% stretch ( Figure 3 A). Superresolution microscopy revealed undulations and wrinkling of the NE/lamina in stretched cells, along with decreased H3K9me3 at the nuclear periphery ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Interestingly, however, total Lamin levels were unaltered ( Figures S3 C and S3D). Transmission electron microscopy and chromatin tomography confirmed nuclear wrinkling and revealed a strong reduction in NE-associated condensed heterochromatin ( Figures 3 D and S3 E; Videos S1 , S2 , and S3 ).

The increased NE wrinkling without substantial nuclear volume changes pointed to reduced nuclear membrane tension (increased nuclear deformability). Nuclear elasticity and deformability depend on nuclear membrane tension, stiffness of the nuclear lamina and chromatin condensation state ( Enyedi and Niethammer, 2017; Stephens et al., 2017, 2018, 2019 27.

Cell. 2019; 30 :2320-2330 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). To quantify nuclear elasticity, we performed atomic force microscopy-based force indentation of the nuclear surface through the cell cortex ( Figure S3 F). Nuclear force indentation showed decreased stiffness in both 5% and 40% stretch conditions, with full recovery upon long-term 40% stretch ( Figure 3 E). Importantly, depolymerization of F-actin did not affect nuclear stiffness, indicating that neither the actin cortex nor perinuclear F-actin contributed to the observed nuclear mechanical changes. In contrast, Lamin A depletion, as expected, strongly reduced nuclear stiffness, confirming the validity of the approach ( Figures S3 F–S3I). To separately assess nuclear membrane tension, we performed fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) using the Flipper-TR membrane tension reporter ( Colom et al., 2018 20. Colom, A. ∙ Derivery, E. ∙ Soleimanpour, S. ... A fluorescent membrane tension probe Nat. Chem. 2018; 10 :1118-1125 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ). FLIM imaging revealed a decrease in Flipper-TR lifetime at perinuclear membranes after 30 min of 40% stretch, indicative of altered membrane state and reduced nuclear membrane tension ( Figures 3 F and S3 J). Collectively, these experiments indicate that mechanical stretch reduces nuclear membrane tension and increases nuclear deformability.
To identify the mechanism by which stretch led to reduced nuclear stiffness and membrane tension, we first investigated the role of changes on Lamin A phosphorylation using phospho-mutant forms of Lamin A (S22A, S22/329A) to mimic the observed decreased phosphorylation of these residues upon stretch. While the phosphorylation-deficient Lamin mutants induced minor nuclear shape abnormalities, they did not impact nuclear elasticity ( Figures S4 A–S4E) or H3K9me3 ( Figures S4 B and S4G).
We thus asked if the H3K9me3 heterochromatin itself could determine nuclear elasticity, as shown for bulk heterochromatin ( Chalut et al., 2012; Spagnol and Dahl, 2016; Stephens et al., 2018 17. Chalut, K.J. ∙ Höpfler, M. ∙ Lautenschläger, F. ... Chromatin decondensation and nuclear softening accompany Nanog downregulation in embryonic stem cells Biophys. J. 2012; 103 :2060-2070 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Spagnol, S.T. ∙ Dahl, K.N. Spatially resolved quantification of chromatin condensation through differential local rheology in cell nuclei fluorescence lifetime imaging PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :1-19 Google Scholar 71. Stephens, A.D. ∙ Liu, P.Z. ∙ Banigan, E.J. ... Chromatin histone modifications and rigidity affect nuclear morphology independent of lamins Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29 :220-233 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). To this end, we analyzed levels of the H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 methyltransferases Setdb1 and Suv39H1 ( Becker et al., 2016 3. Becker, J.S. ∙ Nicetto, D. ∙ Zaret, K.S. H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin: barrier to cell fate changes Trends Genet. 2016; 32 :29-41 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that in particular, the expression of Suv39H1 was reduced in stretched cells ( Figure 4 A), without altering its nuclear localization ( Figure S4 F), indicating that decreased Suv39H1 and the resulting reduction of net methyltransferase activity could explain the reduced H3K9me3. This was supported by the observation that inhibiting H3K9me3 demethylase activity using the pan-selective Jumonji histone demethylase inhibitor JIB4 ( Wang et al., 2013 81. Wang, L. ∙ Chang, J. ∙ Varghese, D. ... A small molecule modulates Jumonji histone demethylase activity and selectively inhibits cancer growth Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2035 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ) did not prevent stretch from reducing H3K9me3 ( Figure S4 H). To directly test the requirement for Suv39H1 activity, we counteracted the observed reduction of Suv39H1 by expressing Suv39H1-IRES-GFP and observed that this indeed prevented H3K9me3 reduction ( Figures 4 B, 4C, and S4 I). Furthermore, this Suv39H1-mediated restoration of H3K9me3 completely prevented nuclear softening ( Figure 4 E). Vice versa, depletion of Suv39H1 in unstretched cells was sufficient to reduce H3K9me3 and nuclear stiffness ( Figures S4 J–S4L).
To understand how H3K9me3 could impact nuclear mechanics, we quantified chromatin rheology by live imaging of CRISPRainbow-tagged telomeres ( Ma et al., 2016 47. Ma, H. ∙ Tu, L.C. ∙ Naseri, A. ... Multiplexed labeling of genomic loci with dCas9 and engineered sgRNAs using CRISPRainbow Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :528-530 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ), as H3K9me3 at chromosome ends was particularly reduced by stretch ( Figure 2 C). We extracted mean square displacement of these regions as a function of lag time ( Spagnol and Dahl, 2014 68. Spagnol, S.T. ∙ Dahl, K.N. Active cytoskeletal force and chromatin condensation independently modulate intranuclear network fluctuations Integr. Biol. 2014; 6 :523-531 Crossref Google Scholar ) and observed that 30 min of 40% stretch substantially increased telomere mobility, which returned to baseline at 360 min ( Figure 4 F), consistent with the transient nuclear softening. Conversely, Suv39H1-expressing cells displayed decreased chromatin mobility ( Figure S4 M), confirming that H3K9me3 levels modulated chromatin rheological properties.
To understand if loss of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin also contributed to the observed NE wrinkling, we analyzed nuclear morphology in Suv39H1-expressing cells and observed that that Suv39H1 expression prevented stretch-induced NE wrinkling ( Figure 4 D).
We next asked if the H3K9me3-mediated increased chromatin mobility and decreased nuclear membrane tension function to absorb mechanical energy necessary to prevent DNA damage. Whereas exogenous stretch did not induce any DNA damage in control cells, stretched cells with increased H3K9me3 displayed substantial amounts of DNA damage, as evidenced by increased γH2AX foci detected by immunofluorescence ( Figure 4 G). Interestingly, no micronuclei or perinuclear accumulation of cGAS-GFP ( Raab et al., 2016 63. Raab, M. ∙ Gentili, M. ∙ de Belly, H. ... ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (625) PubMed Google Scholar ) was observed ( Figures 4 B and S4 N), indicating that stretch does not induce nuclear rupture. Collectively these results indicate that stretch-induced chromatin softening decreases NE tension, mediated by reduced H3K9me3-marked lamina-associated heterochromatin, and that preventing this heterochromatin remodeling leads to DNA damage.
To understand how the supracellular and chromatin mechanoresponses are transduced, we first assessed the role of cell-cell contacts, as cell-cell adhesion was the major phosphoproteome group impacted by stretch ( Figures 1 I–1L) and the adherens junction component α-catenin is a known mechanotransducer ( Yonemura et al., 2010 85. Yonemura, S. ∙ Wada, Y. ∙ Watanabe, T. ... α-Catenin as a tension transducer that induces adherens junction development Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12 :533-542 Crossref Scopus (740) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected ( Noethel et al., 2018 56. Noethel, B. ∙ Ramms, L. ∙ Dreissen, G. ... Transition of responsive mechanosensitive elements from focal adhesions to adherens junctions on epithelial differentiation Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29 :2317-2325 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), depletion of α-catenin prevented adherens junction formation and impaired stretch-induced supracellular alignment ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S5 A, and S5B). In contrast, its depletion did not prevent stretch-induced reduction in H3K9me3 ( Figures 5 C and 5D). However, the H3K9me3 levels failed to recover during long-term stretch of α-catenin-depleted cells ( Figures 5 C and 5D).
As motif enrichment analyses of the phosphoproteomics data revealed enrichment of calcium (Ca 2+ )/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II consensus sites ( Figure S5 C), we asked if Ca 2+ signaling could play a role in nuclear mechanotransduction. Indeed, live imaging of intracellular Ca 2+ revealed that stretch triggered elevated cytoplasmic Ca 2+ ( Figure 5 E; Video S4 ). Strikingly, blocking stretch-induced calcium channels with gadolinium trichloride (GdCl 3 ) ( Adding et al., 2001 1. Adding, L.C. ∙ Bannenberg, G.L. ∙ Gustafsson, L.E. Basic experimental studies and clinical aspects of gadolinium salts and chelates Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2001; 19 :41-56 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ) prevented the H3K9me3 decrease but had no effect on supracellular alignment ( Figures 5 F and S5 D), further confirming that the chromatin and supracellular mechanoresponses occur independently of each other. GdCl 3 also blocked perinuclear actin ring formation ( Figure 5 G), consistent with previous observations demonstrating that perinuclear actin polymerization is Ca 2+ -dependent ( Wales et al., 2016 78. Wales, P. ∙ Schuberth, C.E. ∙ Aufschnaiter, R. ... Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR) mediates acute cell adaptations eLife. 2016; 5 :e19850 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, the absence of the chromatin mechanoresponse in GdCl 3 -treated cells led to increased stretch-induced DNA damage, as predicted ( Figure 5 H).

To identify the specific stretch-induced ion channel, we investigated Piezo channels that are present both at the ER and plasma membrane and play important roles in mechanotransduction ( Coste et al., 2010; Gudipaty et al., 2017; McHugh et al., 2010 21. Coste, B. ∙ Mathur, J. ∙ Schmidt, M. ... Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1965) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Gudipaty, S.A. ∙ Lindblom, J. ∙ Loftus, P.D. ... Mechanical stretch triggers rapid epithelial cell division through Piezo1 Nature. 2017; 543 :118-121 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar 52. McHugh, B.J. ∙ Buttery, R. ∙ Lad, Y. ... Integrin activation by Fam38A uses a novel mechanism of R-Ras targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123 :51-61 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). Piezo1 was highly expressed in EPCs, whereas Piezo2 was not detected, even upon Piezo1 knockdown ( Figure S5 E). FLAG-tagged Piezo1 expression in Piezo1-depleted cells confirmed previous reports that Piezo1 is present at the ER and to some extent at the plasma membrane ( Coste et al., 2010 21. Coste, B. ∙ Mathur, J. ∙ Schmidt, M. ... Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1965) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S5 F). Importantly, depletion of Piezo1 blocked the chromatin mechanoresponse ( Figures 5 I and S5 G) and substantially enhanced stretch-induced DNA damage ( Figure 5 J), indicating that Piezo1 is the responsible stretch-induced ion channel.
We next sought to identify the trigger for the Ca 2+ release and hypothesized that cell stretching could induce direct deformation of the NE and the associated ER, thus prompting Ca 2+ release. Live imaging of cells under 40% stretch indeed revealed immediate deformation of the nucleus in the direction of stretch ( Figure 5 K). This nuclear deformation/elongation was well within the range (<3 μm) where heterochromatin has been described to be the dominant component of nuclear stiffness ( Stephens et al., 2017 70. Stephens, A.D. ∙ Banigan, E.J. ∙ Adam, S.A. ... Chromatin and lamin A determine two different mechanical response regimes of the cell nucleus Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 :1984-1996 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, expression of Suv39H1 to increase H3K9me3 and nuclear stiffness reduced stretch-induced nuclear deformation ( Figure 5 K). Interestingly, this nuclear deformation was accompanied by Ca 2+ release, which, despite abundant extracellular calcium present in the culture medium, could be prevented using thapsigargin pretreatment to block the sarco/ER Ca 2+ ATPase to empty ER calcium stores prior to stretch ( Gerasimenko et al., 2003 29. Gerasimenko, J. ∙ Maruyama, Y. ∙ Tepikin, A. ... Calcium signalling in and around the nuclear envelope Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31 :76-78 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 L). Consistently, chelating intracellular calcium using BAPTA-AM ( Tang et al., 2007; Tsien, 1981 74. Tang, Q. ∙ Jin, M.W. ∙ Xiang, J.Z. ... The membrane permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM directly blocks human ether a-go-go-related gene potassium channels stably expressed in HEK 293 cells Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74 :1596-1607 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar 76. Tsien, R.Y. A non-disruptive technique for loading calcium buffers and indicators into cells Nature. 1981; 290 :527-528 Crossref Scopus (853) PubMed Google Scholar ) also prevented stretch-induced heterochromatin remodeling ( Figure 5 M), resulting in DNA damage ( Figure S5 H).
In contrast to manipulation of ER Ca 2+ stores, removing extracellular Ca 2+ from the extracellular space did not prevent the chromatin mechanoresponse ( Figure S5 I), confirming the outer nuclear membrane/ER as the source for the Ca 2+ . However, removal of extracellular Ca 2+ , as expected, prevented formation of E-cadherin-based junctions ( Meng and Takeichi, 2009 53. Meng, W. ∙ Takeichi, M. Adherens junction: molecular architecture and regulation Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1 :a002899 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus preventing supracellular alignment and recovery of H3K9me3 levels ( Figures S5 J and S5K). This was consistent with the observation that adherens junctions are dispensable for the chromatin mechanoresponse but required for monolayer reorientation and concomitant restoration of heterochromatin.
To understand if direct cell/nuclear deformation is capable of triggering ER Ca 2+ release and subsequent nuclear mechanotransduction, we compressed cells using pressure-controlled pillars whose height was calculated to induce nuclear deformation ( Figure 6 A). As predicted, elevated cytosolic Ca 2+ was triggered by both compression and its release ( Figure S6 A). Intriguingly, compression was also sufficient to reduce H3K9me3 ( Figure 6 B). As for stretch, chelating intracellular calcium using BAPTA-AM prevented the compression-induced reduction in H3K9me3 ( Figure 6 B).
Piezo1 activity can be tuned by plasma membrane tension ( Lewis and Grandl, 2015 42. Lewis, A.H. ∙ Grandl, J. Mechanical sensitivity of Piezo1 ion channels can be tuned by cellular membrane tension eLife. 2015; 4 :e12088 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus asked if nuclear membrane tension could similarly threshold the effect of stretch/ER Ca 2+ -triggered reduction in H3K9me3. As nuclear membrane tension has previously been shown to scale with Lamin A levels ( Buxboim et al., 2017 14. Buxboim, A. ∙ Irianto, J. ∙ Swift, J. ... Coordinated increase of nuclear tension and lamin-A with matrix stiffness outcompetes lamin-B receptor that favors soft tissue phenotypes Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 :3333-3348 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we first asked if the effect of stretch on H3K9me3 scales with Lamin A. To this end, we compared two stem cell types, EPCs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with two cancer cell lines, the epithelial cancer SCC9 and fibrosarcoma HT1080. Both stem cell types had high Lamin A and high nuclear elastic moduli, and they responded to 40% stretch by reducing H3K9me3 ( Figures 6 C–6E). In contrast, both cancer cell lines had low Lamin A levels and low nuclear elastic moduli, and they showed a slight increase in H3K9me3 levels upon stretch ( Figures 6 C–6E), consistent with previous reports ( Stephens et al., 2019 72. Stephens, A.D. ∙ Liu, P.Z. ∙ Kandula, V. ... Physicochemical mechanotransduction alters nuclear shape and mechanics via heterochromatin formation Mol. Biol. Cell. 2019; 30 :2320-2330 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, increasing Lamin A expression in HT-1080 cells rendered them sensitive to stretch-induced intracellular Ca 2+ release ( Figure 6 F), and these cells now also responded to stretch by decreasing H3K9me3 levels ( Figure 6 G). Conversely, reducing Lamin A in EPCs using small interfering RNA (siRNA) strongly reduced the nuclear elastic modulus and prevented stretch from further decreasing H3K9me3 and nuclear stiffness ( Figures 6 H and S6 B).
Collectively, these results suggest that the nucleus and the associated ER membranes sense deformation, the sensitivity of which is defined by steady-state nuclear stiffness/membrane tension. Cell/nuclear deformation of cells with taut nuclei and high membrane tension triggers Ca 2+ release from the ER, inducing perinuclear actin polymerization and heterochromatin changes to promote chromatin mobility and decrease apparent NE tension. These changes are likely to facilitate dissipation of mechanical energy to prevent DNA damage.
We next set out to understand how cells experiencing long-term stretch are able to switch off nuclear mechanotransduction to restore steady-state chromatin and nuclear architecture. We hypothesized that anisotropic positioning of the long axes of cells, nuclei, and F-actin stress fibers perpendicular to stretch direction represented the phenomenon of strain avoidance ( De et al., 2007; Obbink-Huizer et al., 2014 24. De, R. ∙ Zemel, A. ∙ Safran, S.A. Dynamics of cell orientation Nat. Phys. 2007; 3 :655-659 Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar 57. Obbink-Huizer, C. ∙ Oomens, C.W.J. ∙ Loerakker, S. ... Computational model predicts cell orientation in response to a range of mechanical stimuli Biomech. Model. Mechanobiol. 2014; 13 :227-236 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ) to minimize nuclear strain. To test this, EPC monolayers were pre-stretched for 360 min at 40% to allow full alignment (see Figures 1 B and 1C). Live imaging of these fully aligned monolayers during exposure to a second cycle of 40% stretch in the same stretch direction showed absence of nuclear deformation ( Figures 7 A and 7B). In contrast, substantial deformation was detected in monolayers that were re-exposed to a second cycle of 40% stretch but now in perpendicular direction relative to the first stretch cycle ( Figures 7 A and 7B).
Next, we directly tested the causative relationship between alignment and nuclear mechanotransduction using the setup described above. Strikingly, forcing parallel orientation of the pre-aligned monolayers to stretch resulted in re-formation of perinuclear actin rings, strong suppression of H3K9me3, and disruption of adherens junctions ( Figures 7 C–7G). Consistent with the importance of alignment in allowing H3K9me3 restoration, applying 20% biaxial stretch where alignment does not occur led to long-term suppression of H3K9me3 ( Figures S7 A–S7C). Thus, we conclude that supracellular monolayer alignment blocks nuclear mechanotransduction to allow restoration of the chromatin state and to minimize stress-induced load on adhesion structures, which together ensure global mechanoprotection of the EPC monolayers. This notion was consistent with the observations that depletion of α-catenin or removal of extracellular Ca 2+ not only attenuated alignment but also prevented restoration of heterochromatin during long-term 40% stretch (see Figures 5 C, 5D and S5 I).
Finally, we asked if the observed nuclear mechanotransduction and altered heterochromatin states observed in vitro are also relevant in intact tissue. To this end, we established an ex vivo system to stretch intact skin from mouse embryos ( Figure S7 D). Strikingly, exposing embryonic stage 15.5 skin to 40% uniaxial, cyclic stretch induced a transient reduction in heterochromatin both in the basal stem cell and suprabasal layers, after which H3K9me3 was restored to levels even slightly higher than at stretch onset ( Figures 7 H, 7I, and S7 E). This reduced H3K9me3 was subsequently overridden by supracellular alignment ( Figures 7 H and 7J). As expected, the alignment in intact skin occurred in the direction of stretch, resulting from differences in 2D versus 3D tissue ability of cell intercalation, F-actin remodeling, and/or differences in the ratios of tissue compaction strains to applied cyclic strains ( Blanchard et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2018; Obbink-Huizer et al., 2014 7. Blanchard, G.B. ∙ Kabla, A.J. ∙ Schultz, N.L. ... Tissue tectonics: morphogenetic strain rates, cell shape change and intercalation Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :458-464 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar 18. Chen, K. ∙ Vigliotti, A. ∙ Bacca, M. ... Role of boundary conditions in determining cell alignment in response to stretch Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :986-991 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar 57.

Mechanobiol. 2014; 13 :227-236 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, no signs of tissue damage in response to stretch was observed, as also indicated by the lack of apoptosis ( Figure 7 H).
To assess whether physiological stresses generated by tissue deformation also trigger heterochromatin changes, we analyzed epithelial folds during digit morphogenesis where high lateral tension is present ( Sui et al., 2018 73. Sui, L. ∙ Alt, S. ∙ Weigert, M. ... Differential lateral and basal tension drive folding of Drosophila wing discs through two distinct mechanisms Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4620 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), also demonstrated by increased mechanical unfolding of α-catenin and myosin activity ( Figures S7 F–S7H). Importantly, reduction of H3K9me3 in stem cells showed strong spatial correlation with the folding curvature of the tissue at these sites ( Figure 7 K). Collectively these data demonstrate that alterations in chromatin states are associated with dynamic changes in tissue tension in vivo .

Section: Discussion

The functional demands and longevity of tissue-specific stem cells require particularly efficient mechanisms to counteract damage ( Mandal et al., 2011 49. Mandal, P.K. ∙ Blanpain, C. ∙ Rossi, D.J. DNA damage response in adult stem cells: pathways and consequences Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :198-202 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA damage compromises stem cell function and tissue integrity, and much is known about how DNA damage is mitigated in stem cells ( Blanpain et al., 2011 8. Blanpain, C. ∙ Mohrin, M. ∙ Sotiropoulou, P.A. ... DNA-damage response in tissue-specific and cancer stem cells Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8 :16-29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, little is known about the mechanisms that prevent unwanted chromatin rearrangements and DNA damage upon nuclear deformation that occurs when cells experience mechanical forces. We propose that chromatin mechanoprotection employs two distinct mechanisms: (1) a rapid, sensitive chromatin response that relies on ER Ca 2+ release to reduce lamina-associated heterochromatin, thereby increasing chromatin mobility and lowering nuclear membrane tension; and (2) a slower, less sensitive supracellular response that relies on cell-cell contacts to reorient cell and nuclear long axes, adherens junctions, and F-actin to prevent nuclear strain. We further propose that the nuclear mechanoprotection, via the induction of changes in chromatin state to alter its mechanics, provides an unspecific “emergency break” mechanism for tissues to endure sudden and dynamic deformations without damaging their genomes. The observed chromatin “fluidification” provides an effective means to dissipate mechanical energy ( Bonakdar et al., 2016 10. Bonakdar, N. ∙ Gerum, R. ∙ Kuhn, M. ... Mechanical plasticity of cells Nat. Mater. 2016; 15 :1090-1094 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus reducing direct force propagation to the DNA, preventing torsion or even breaks. This finding is consistent with the observed fluidization of cytoplasmic material in response to mechanical stress ( Blanchard et al., 2009; Harris et al., 2012; Kollmannsberger and Fabry, 2011; Trepat et al., 2008 7. Blanchard, G.B. ∙ Kabla, A.J. ∙ Schultz, N.L. ... Tissue tectonics: morphogenetic strain rates, cell shape change and intercalation Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :458-464 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Harris, A.R. ∙ Peter, L. ∙ Bellis, J. ... Characterizing the mechanics of cultured cell monolayers Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :16449-16454 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Kollmannsberger, P. ∙ Fabry, B. Linear and nonlinear rheology of living cells Annu. Rev. Mater.

Universality in cell mechanics Soft Matter. 2008; 4 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar ).
The observed chromatin mechanoresponse is triggered by nuclear deformation, which results in Ca 2+ release from the ER in a Piezo1-dependent manner. The sensitivity of the ER calcium release is determined by Lamin A levels and nuclear stiffness, where stiffer nuclei are more likely to respond. One possible explanation is that stiffer nuclei deform less upon stretch, and the associated ER membranes are subjected to more stretch and increased membrane tension. Also, higher levels of Lamin A may allow stronger mechanointegration with the cytoskeleton via the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex ( Cho et al., 2017 19. Cho, S. ∙ Irianto, J. ∙ Discher, D.E. Mechanosensing by the nucleus: From pathways to scaling relationships J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216 :305-315 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Parallel to H3K9me3 remodeling, Ca 2+ release catalyzes perinuclear actin ring formation. Previous work shows that biaxial stretch-induced actin polymerization reduces free nuclear G-actin to attenuate transcription in an H3K27me3-dependent manner ( Le et al., 2016; Wales et al., 2016 40. Le, H.Q. ∙ Ghatak, S. ∙ Yeung, C.Y.C. ... Mechanical regulation of transcription controls Polycomb-mediated gene silencing during lineage commitment Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :864-875 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar 78. Wales, P. ∙ Schuberth, C.E. ∙ Aufschnaiter, R. ... Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR) mediates acute cell adaptations eLife. 2016; 5 :e19850 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, we now recapitulate these findings also in the context of low-amplitude uniaxial stretch, where similarly to biaxial stretch, the monolayers do not undergo supracellular alignment. The Ca 2+ dependency of both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3-mediated chromatin remodeling suggests that nuclear deformation is upstream of both effects.
Since precise control of epigenetic chromatin states and the ability to efficiently silence specific genomic loci are essential for proper control of genetic programs and cell identity ( Bickmore and van Steensel, 2013 6. Bickmore, W.A. ∙ van Steensel, B. Genome architecture: domain organization of interphase chromosomes Cell. 2013; 152 :1270-1284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (548) PubMed Google Scholar ), the chromatin-driven mechanoresponse might not be a sustainable, long-term means to bear loads. Thus, a more effective form of long-term, mechanoprotection, such as the observed supracellular rearrangement of the epidermis is required. In situations where supracellular alignment is not induced, due to insufficient stretch amplitude or lack of unidirectionality of stretch, sustained chromatin fluidification leads to transcriptional repression and decreased expression of cell identity and differentiation genes. Whether this represents a detrimental effect of mechanical stress or a mechanism of long-term physiological adaptation remains open for future studies. Importantly, the molecular mechanisms described here are generic and functional in a broad range of cell types and model systems. Thus, the nuclear mechanoadaptation mechanisms that reduce nuclear membrane tension, increase chromatin mobility, and reorient monolayers are likely to have broad significance in vivo .

Cell. 2018; 29 :2317-2325 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers were prepared from a two-component formulation (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) by mixing base and crosslinker in a ratio of 40 to 1 (weight/weight) to obtain substrates with 50 kPa stiffness. The solutions were mixed vigorously for 5 minutes after which the mix was degassed using a vacuum pump. After pouring solution on the molds the PDMS was cured by incubation at 60°C for 16 h. After removing the silicon chambers from the molds, chambers were UV sterilized for 1h and finally coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37°C prior to cell seeding. 300 000 cells per elastomer (4 cm 2 ) were seeded 16 h before experiment start. 3 h before initiation of cyclic stretch, culture medium was replaced by medium containing 1.8 mM Ca 2+ to promote cell-cell contact formation, unless indicated otherwise. Chambers were clamped into the stretching device where a linear stage for uniaxial stretch was driven by a direct current motor with integrated gearbox (RB35, Conrad Electronic SE). Cells were then exposed to 5, 20, 40% stretch at 0.1 Hz frequency. Stretch amplitudes were preselected with an accuracy of 20 μm and they were stable during the experiment.
For biaxial stretch, culture plates with a silicon elastomere membrane (Bioflex; FlexCell International Corporation) were coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml) in PBS for 1 h at 37°C prior to cell seeding. 600 000 cells per elastomer were seeded 16 h prior to experiment start, and 3 h before initiation of stretch culture medium was replaced by medium containing 1.8 mM Ca 2+ . Cells were then exposed to cyclic mechanical strain using the Flexcell Tension System (FX4000T; FlexCell International Corporation) at 20% elongation, 0.1Hz frequency.
Where indicated, cells were treated with gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate (25 μM, Sigma-Aldrich), BAPTA-AM (10 μM, Abcam) or JIB4 (10 μM, Tocris), which were added to the culture 15 min prior to mechanical stretch/compression. Thapsigargin (2 μM, Abcam) was added at the start of live imaging of stretch. The vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control for all treatments.

Telomeres were tagged using co-transfection of a 3-vector CRISPR Rainbow system as described in Ma et al. (2016) 47. Ma, H. ∙ Tu, L.C. ∙ Naseri, A. ... Multiplexed labeling of genomic loci with dCas9 and engineered sgRNAs using CRISPRainbow Nat.

Wild-type GFP-tagged Lamin A, S22A and S22A/S329A phosphomutants were a gift from John Eriksson (University of Turku, Finland) and have been described earlier ( Kochin et al., 2014 35. Kochin, V. ∙ Shimi, T. ∙ Torvaldson, E. ... Interphase phosphorylation of lamin A J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 :2683-2696 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMax or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After 72 h (siRNA), or 24 h (protein expression) of transfection cells were subjected to specific experimental analyses.
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or ice-cold methanol, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Samples were subsequently incubated overnight in primary antibody in 1% BSA/0.3% Triton X-100/PBS, followed by washing in PBS and incubation in secondary antibody in 1% BSA/0.3% Triton X-100/PBS. Finally, samples were mounted in Elvanol. The following antibodies were used: H3K9me2,3 (Cell Signaling 5327; 1:1000), H3K9me3 (Cell Signaling 13969; 1:1600) H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling 9733; 1:1000), H3K9me2 (Thermo Fisher PA5-16195; 1:1000) Phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139) (Cell Signaling 9718; 1:500), Lamin A/C (Cell Signaling 4777; 1:200), Lamin A/C (Abcam; ab133256; 1:1000), Lamin B1 (Abcam; ab16048; 1:1000), RNA-Pol II (s2P) (Abcam; ab5095; 1:1000), SUV39H1 (Thermo Fisher PA5-29470; 1:1000).

Alexa Fluor 488, 568 and 647 conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, all from Invitrogen). Actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488, 568, or 647-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen; 1:600).
All fluorescence images were collected by laser scanning confocal microscopy (SP8X; Leica) with Leica Application Suite software (LAS X version 2.0.0.14332), using 40x, 63x or 100x immersion objectives. Images where acquired at room temperature using sequential scanning of frames of 1 μm thick confocal planes (pinhole 1) after which 10 planes encompassing complete cell nuclei were projected as a maximum intensity confocal stack. Images were collected with the same settings for all samples within an experiment.
Images were analyzed using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 66. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). For nuclear imaging of histone modifications, fields were randomly selected based exclusively on the presence of nuclei, as assessed by DAPI staining. Areas of interest were generated using automated thresholding of the DAPI staining, after which mean fluorescence intensities of nuclear stainings were quantified within the areas of interest from maximum projection images obtained as described above. The measured mean nuclear intensities were normalized to DAPI intensity of the corresponding individual nuclei to account for possible unevenness in sample topology.
To measure the distribution of F-actin fiber direction, maximum projections of phalloidin fluorescence were analyzed using the Directionality plug-in in Fiji ( Liu, 1991 44. Liu, Z.-Q. Scale space approach to directional analysis of images Appl. Opt. 1991; 30 :1369-1373 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is based on Fourier spectrum analysis. E-cadherin-positive adherens junctions were traced to measure the orientation (range −90 to +90°) with respect to a line parallel to the y axis of the image. Two-dimensional nuclear features were quantified from maximum projections of DAPI fluorescence. Nuclear aspect ratio (calculated as major (a) to minor axis (b) ratio and orientation angle (the angle between the long axis and a line parallel to the x axis of the image) were measured by using the “Analyze particles” function in Fiji. Three-dimensional nuclear features were measured from confocal stacks by running 3D Objects Counter and 3D Ellipsoid Fitting plug-ins ( Bolte and Cordelières, 2006; Orré et al., 2019 9. Bolte, S. ∙ Cordelières, F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy J. Microsc. 2006; 224 :213-232 Crossref Scopus (3770) PubMed Google Scholar 59. Orré, T. ∙ Rossier, O. ∙ Giannone, G. The inner life of integrin adhesion sites: From single molecules to functional macromolecular complexes Exp. Cell Res. 2019; 379 :235-244 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To quantify perinuclear actin ring intensity, nuclear areas of interest were generated by automatic thresholding on maximum projections of DAPI fluorescence. These areas of interests were then duplicated and dilated by a factor of 0.2 to obtain 0.2 μm-thick bands. The resulting 0.2um-thick bands were redirected on midplanes of phalloidin-stained confocal stacks to quantify perinuclear F-actin intensity.
Live nuclear deformation was quantified by generating areas of interest by automatic thresholding on maximum projections of nuclear dye fluorescence directly before and during stretching the elastomere substrate. We measured nuclear areas A , and the equivalent radius was calculated as r e q = 2 √ ( A / π ) . 𝛥 ⁢ r e q was defined as the percentage difference between the equivalent radius during and prior to stretch.
To quantify nuclear rupture, cells were transfected with cGAS-GFP as described above. Total cGAS-GFP intensity was measured by automatic thresholding on maximum projections of cGAS-GFP fluorescence, and in parallel nuclear areas of interest were generated by automatic thresholding on maximum projections of DAPI fluorescence. Nuclear areas of interests were then duplicated and dilated by a factor of 0.4 to obtain 0.4μm-thick bands. The resulting 0.4μm-thick bands were redirected on maximum projections of cGAS-GFP images quantify perinuclear cGAS-GFP intensity. Perinuclear cGAS-GFP intensity values were then normalized to the corresponding cGAS-GFP total intensity.
All mass spectrometry samples, performed in biological triplicates, were lysed in 6 M guanidinium chloride buffer supplemented with 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10 mM chloroacetamide in 100mM Tris-HCl. Following lysis samples were heated at 95°C for 10 min, sonicated at high performance for 10 cycles (30 s on/off) using Bioruptor Plus Ultrasonicator (Diagenode), and span down for 20 minutes at room temperature at 20000 g. Supernatants were then Trypsin-Gold digested (Promega Corp., V5280) overnight at 37°C. Following digestion samples were acidified to block trypsin activity and peptides were cleaned with custom-packed C18-SD. Stage Tips. Eluted peptides were vacuum dried at 30°C and either subjected to LC/MS or further processed to enrich for phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptides were enriched using the 3 mg/200 μL Titansphere Phos-TiO kit (GL Sciences) according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, spin tips were assembled with centrifugal adaptors and connected to waste fluid tubes; 3000 g spins for 2 min at room temperature were used for all steps. Spin tips were first conditioned with 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid/8 0% acetonitrile solution and then equilibrated with 25% lactic acid in equilibration buffer. Peptides were then adsorbed to the spin tips, rinsed twice, and eluted with 5% ammonium hydroxide. After elution phosphopeptides were vacuum dehydrated for 2 hours at 30°C, cleaned with custom-packed C18-SD. Stage Tips. Both phosphopeptides and total peptides were separated on a 25 cm, 75 μm internal diameter PicoFrit analytical column (New Objective) packed with 1.9 μm ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ media (Dr. Maisch) using an EASY-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The column was maintained at 50°C. Buffer A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Peptides were separated on a segmented gradient from 6% to 31% buffer B for 120 min and then from 31% to 50% for 10 min followed by washing and re-equilibration. Eluted peptides from cells were analyzed with an Orbitrap QExactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide precursor m/z measurements were carried out at resolution of 60000 in the range of 300 to 1800 m/z. The ten most intense precursors with charge state from 2 to 7 were selected for HCD fragmentation using 25% normalized collision energy. The m/z values of the peptide fragments were measured at a resolution of 30000 using an AGC target of 2e5 and 55 ms maximum injection time. For phophopeptides an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for analyzing. Peptide precursor m/z measurements were carried out at resolution of 60000 in the range of 300 to 1500 m/z. Top speed mode was used to select precursors with charge state from 2 to 7 for HCD fragmentation using 27% normalized collision energy. The m/z values of the peptide fragments were measured at a resolution of 60000 using an AGC target of 2e5 and 120 ms maximum injection time. The raw data were analyzed with MaxQuant version 1.6.1.0 using the integrated Andromeda search engine. Peptide fragmentation spectra were searched against the canonical and isoform sequences of the human reference proteome (proteome ID UP000005640, downloaded September 2018 from UniProt). Methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications; cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification. The digestion parameters were set to “specific” and “Trypsin/P,” The minimum number of peptides and razor peptides for protein identification was 1 and the minimum number of unique peptides was 0. Protein identification was performed at a peptide spectrum matches and protein false discovery rate of 0.01. The “second peptide” option was on. Successful identifications were transferred between the different raw files using the “Match between runs” option. Label-free quantification (LFQ) was performed using an LFQ minimum ratio count of 2. LFQ intensities were filtered for a number of valid values that was equal to the minimum number of replicates in an experimental group minus one. Missing values were imputed from a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and down shift of 1.8. Differential abundance analysis was performed with the Perseus statistical framework ( http://maxquant.net/perseus/ ) version 1.5.2.4. After removing the contaminants and reverse identifications, the intensities were transformed to log2. One-way ANOVA was performed to identify the significantly up- and downregulated proteins. Benjamini-Hochberg FDR 0.05 was used for truncation.
Total RNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey&Nagel). After quantification and quality control using Agilent 2200 TapeStation, total RNA amounts were adjusted and libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit with Ribo-zero gold rRNA depletion (Illumina). Paired-end RNA sequencing was carried out on Illumina HiSeq2000 machines by using the 2_100-bp protocol and V3 chemistry from three biological replicates per condition. After quality control, adaptor sequences were removed with flexbar63. Reads mapping to rRNA-related genes were filtered out by using a custom ribosomal RNA-only reference. After preprocessing, reads were mapped using Kallisto version 0.45.0 0 ( Bray et al., 2016 12. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (5202) PubMed Google Scholar ) creating pseudo-alignments to the human reference genome build hg38. Gene expression was subsequently estimated using featureCounts version v1.6.2. ( Liao et al., 2014 43. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (13429) PubMed Google Scholar ). FeatureCounts results were aggregated over all samples and pairwise differential gene expression was calculated using the R package DEseq2 version 1.22.2 ( Love et al., 2014 46. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene ontology term analyses were performed using Panther.
400 000 cells per elastomer were seeded a day prior to the experiment. Cells from 6 elastomers were pooled to generate a single biological replicate. Cells were exposed to 40% stretch for 30 min after which both stretched and control cells plated on elastomers were fixed in 1% methanol-free paraformaldehyde (Pierce) in CnT medium for 5 min at room temperature. Fixation was terminated by removing fixative and adding 0.125M Glycine in PBS for 5 min in room temperature. Cells were subsequently rinsed twice with PBS after which cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors, collected, and pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C. Pellets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. After all biological replicates had been collected, all samples were further processed together. Cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.1% NP-40) after which nuclei were passed through 10 strokes of Dounce homogenization to aid nuclear release and collected by centrifugation at 4600xg for 10 min at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 130 μl of sonication buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS + protease inhibitors) and sonicated using a Covaris M20 sonicator (4-9°C temperature range; 5% duty factor 75% peak power) for 4.5 min. After sonication, samples were subjected to centrifugation at 21000xg at 4°C and the supernatant was collected as the chromatin fraction. DNA concentration was measured using Qubit DS High-sensitivity kit (Invitrogen) and sample concentrations were adjusted to be equal. 10% of chromatin was collected as input and 2μl was analyzed using using Agilent 2200 TapeStation to ensure optimal shearing (300-600 bp fragments) and the rest was subjected to immunoprecipitation. For this, 380 μl of sonication buffer and 3 μg of antibody (H3K9me3, Abcam ab8898; H3K27me3, Cell Signaling #9733; or IgG control, Cell Signaling #2729) was added and samples were incubated in an end-over mixer for 16 h at 4°C. 30 μl protein G Dynabeads was subsequently added to each sample, which were then further rotated in an end-over mixer for 4 h at 4°C. Beads were collected using a magnet and washed once with sonication buffer, followed by washes in wash buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), wash buffer 2 (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate), and finally with 20 mM Tris pH 8,0, 1 mM EDTA. Samples were subsequently eluted in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0,1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. To reverse crosslinks, 8 μl 1M NaCl and 5 μl of 20mg/mL Proteinase K were added to the samples, which were then incubated first 3h at 42°C and then 65°C for 16 h. Subsequently, 10mg/ml RNase A was added for 2 h 37°C. DNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, after which DNA content was quantified using Qubit. Samples were analyzed by qPCR or next generation sequencing.
Libraries were prepared from 20 ng ChIP or input DNA using TruSeq ChIP library preparation kit (Illumina) and sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq6000 machines using the 2_100-bp protocol from three biological replicates. After quality control and adaptor removal as described above for RNaseq, reads were mapped to the reference genome hg38 using bowtie2 version 2.3.4.1 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 38. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each sample, broad ChIP peaks were detected using macs2 ( Ma et al., 2016 47. Ma, H. ∙ Tu, L.C. ∙ Naseri, A. ... Multiplexed labeling of genomic loci with dCas9 and engineered sgRNAs using CRISPRainbow Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :528-530 Crossref Scopus (329) PubMed Google Scholar ) with merged ChIP input files. Consensus peaks for H3K9me3 binding and the subsequent analysis of differential H3K9me3 binding sites were performed using the R package DiffBind version 2.10.0 ( Ross-Innes et al., 2012 64. Ross-Innes, C.S. ∙ Stark, R. ∙ Teschendorff, A.E. ... Differential oestrogen receptor binding is associated with clinical outcome in breast cancer Nature. 2012; 481 :389-393 Crossref Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consensus peaks were annotated with biotypes using the R package ChIPseeker version 1.5.1 ( Yu et al., 2015 86. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.-G. ∙ He, Q.-Y. ChIPseeker: an R/Bioconductor package for ChIP peak annotation, comparison and visualization Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :2382-2383 Crossref Scopus (1977) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the Bioconductor annotation databases TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene and org.Hs.eg.db.
Chromosome occupancy profiles were generated using a custom R script with the following steps: Genomic location for summit of consensus peaks was calculated, followed by calculation of relative position of summit by dividing by the respective chromosome size which was rounded to 2 decimal points. The number of peaks with the same relative position were counted, essentially binning the peaks into 1% chromosomal intervals. All chromosomes were compiled by calculating the average number of down/upregulated peaks for each bin after which data was smoothed by averaging over 5 bins.
To quantify overlap between RNaseq and ChIPseq datasets, genomic location of genes was expanded to include the region 5000 bp upstream of the transcription start site. ChIP peaks were intersected with expanded genomic locations of genes expressed in the RNaseq using bedtools intersect version 2.26.0 ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 62. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15098) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cells were rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and cleared by centrifugation. The lysates were then reduced in Laemmli sample buffer at 95°C, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (TBS-Tween) for 1 h at room temperature, after which primary antibodies were added in 5% BSA, TBS-Tween and incubated over night at +4°C. The membranes were subsequently washed in TBS-Tween after which secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad) were added in 5% milk powder in TBS-Tween and incubated for 30 min room temperature. After extensive washing in TBS-Tween, antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence (Immobilon Western, Millipore) using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Imaging System. The following antibodies were used: GAPDH (Cell Signaling 2118; 1:5000), total H3 (Cell Signaling 3638; 1:5000), H3K9me2,3 (Cell Signaling 5327; 1:5000), Lamin A/C (Cell Signaling 4777; 1:2500), Lamin B1 (Cell Signaling 9087; 1:1000), Lamin B2 (Cell Signaling 9622; 1:1000), Setdb1 (Abcam ab12317; 1:2000), Suv39h1 (Thermo PA-29470; 1:2000), pLamin A (S22; Invitrogen PA5-17113; 1:2500), pPaxillin (Tyr31; Thermo 44-720G; 1:2500), pCDK1-3 (T14; Cell Signaling 9477; 1:2500), pCofilin (S3; Cell Signaling 3313; 1:2500), Hsp90 (Cell Signaling 4874; 1:2500).
AFM measurements were performed on cell monolayers plated on silicon elastomers using JPK NanoWizard 2 (Bruker Nano) atomic force microscope mounted on an Olympus IX73 inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus) and operated via JPK SPM Control Software v.5. Elastomers were mounted on the AFM directly after cyclic stretch and measurements were performed within 15 minutes. Triangular non-conductive Silicon Nitride cantilevers (MLCT, Bruker Daltonics) with a nominal spring constant of 0.01 Nm −1 were used for the nanoindentation experiments of the apical surface of cells and the nucleus. For all indentation experiments, forces of up to 3 nN were applied, and the velocities of cantilever approach and retraction were kept constant at 2 μm s −1 ensuring an indentation depth of 500nm. All analyses were performed with JPK Data Processing Software (Bruker Nano). Prior to fitting the Hertz model corrected by the tip geometry to obtain Young’s Modulus (Poisson’s ratio of 0.5), the offset was removed from the baseline, contact point was identified, and cantilever bending was subtracted from all force curves.
For chromatin rheology studies, confluent EPC monolayers were transfected as described above with pHAGE-TO-dCas9/pHAGE-EFS-PCP-3xGFPnls/ pLH-sgRNA1-2xPP7 vectors to label telomeres, as well as either pEGFP-N1 or Suv91H1-IRES-EGFP. 24 h post transfection, confluent monolayers were subjected to stretch for indicated times and subsequent immediate live imaging at a frame rate of 1000 ms for 5 min using a 60X/1.42 Plan Apo N oil objective and a CoolSnap HQ2 camera mounted on an inverted Olympus IX73 epifluorescence microscope and visualized with PVCamTest software version 3.4.183.
One-dimensional tracking of the fluorophores was performed using custom Laptrack71 programs designed in MATLAB (Natick) as previously published ( Booth-Gauthier et al., 2012 11. Booth-Gauthier, E.A. ∙ Alcoser, T.A. ∙ Yang, G. ... Force-induced changes in subnuclear movement and rheology Biophys. J. 2012; 103 :2423-2431 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, images were cropped and aligned to remove artifacts (imaging drift, nuclear translation and rotation), only persistent tracks of particles were used for analysis. The ensemble-averaged mean squared displacement (MSD) was calculated versus lag time, τ with error bars of SEM. For tracks that were linear MSD versus τ, the effective diffusivity (D eff ) was calculated as MSD = D eff τ on this timescale of measurement. The 95% confidence intervals for D eff values were used for statistical comparison. If 95% confidence intervals did not overlap, values of D eff were considered significantly different. Error bars comparing the D eff represent the 95% confidence interval.
The following electron microscopy grade reagents were used - formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, EMS-15710), Glutaraldehyde (EM-grade, Sigma, G7651), Osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences, RT 19130), 0.4M sodium cacodylate buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 11654).
Samples for transmission electron microscopy analyses were fixed and prepared exactly as described previously ( Ou et al., 2017 60. Ou, H.D. ∙ Phan, S. ∙ Deerinck, T.J. ... ChromEMT: visualizing 3D chromatin structure and compaction in interphase and mitotic cells Science. 2017; 357 :eaag0025 Crossref Scopus (553) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, samples were fixed with 2.5% electron microscopy grade glutaraldehyde in 5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 at room temperature for 5 min, following 1 h fixation on ice. Following fixation all the steps were performed on ice. Samples were first washed 5 times with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and blocked for 15 min in 10 mM glycine/10 mM potassium cyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (blocking buffer). Following blocking samples were rinsed 1X with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and then stained with 10 μM DRAQ5 in 0.1% saponin in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 10 min, followed by washing 3x for 5 min with above-described blocking buffer. Samples were then incubated with 2.5 mM diaminobezidine tetrahydrochloride in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and placed onto a glass-bottom dish, monolayer side down, then mounted onto Zeiss confocal microscope surrounded by ice-packs to maintain a near 4°C temperature and imaged using a 63X oil immersion objective lens and 633 nm filter set to continuously illuminate the membranes for 10 min. Samples were then rinsed 3x for 5 min with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, following a 1 h stain with 1% osmium tetroxide, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Post staining, samples were washed twice for 2 min with double-distilled water, dehydrated in ethanol series prior to gradual infiltration into Epon (TAAB 812), then cut into 80 nm sections and mounted on copper slot grids for imaging on a conventional 80 kV Jeol JEM-1400 (Jeol Ltd).
For 3D electron tomography samples were prepared as described above. After polymerization in Epon overnight at 60°C, a pyramid was made using a razor blade on the area of cells of darker, photo-oxidized nucleus. 230-nm-thick sections were cut with a 35° diamond knife (Diatome) on Leica EM Ultracut UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica) and collected on Pioloform-coated single slot copper grids.
Dual axis tilt series were recorded from a semi-thick section using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 1997 51. Mastronarde, D.N. Dual-axis tomography: an approach with alignment methods that preserve resolution J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120 :343-352 Crossref Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ) software running on a Tecnai FEG 20 transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 200 kV, high tilt specimen holder (model 2020; E.A. Fischione Instruments) and a 4k by 4k Ultrascan CCD camera (Gatan Inc). The tilt series were acquired at one-degree intervals between ± 62° at nominal magnification of 14,500x and 10-nm gold particles placed on both grid faces served as fiducial markers for alignment. Prior alignment and reconstruction with IMOD software package (versions 4.9.0 and 4.10.18) ( Kremer et al., 1996 37. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (4018) PubMed Google Scholar ) the images were binned by two providing a pixel size of 1.5 nm. The tomograms were reconstructed with a simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique using 14 iterations.
For visualization of the condensed chromatin the tomograms were binned by 2, scaled to a common mean and standard deviation using IMOD software package (version 4.10.32). The condensed DNA was then selected within the nucleus (nuclei segmented using MIB, version 2.501 ( Belevich et al., 2016 4. Belevich, I. ∙ Joensuu, M. ∙ Kumar, D. ... Microscopy image browser: a platform for segmentation and analysis of multidimensional datasets PLoS Biol. 2016; 14 :e1002340 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar )) by gray level thresholding (center value 127), removing separate pixels by smoothing and excluding objects smaller than 800, fraction 50 using Amira software (version 5.3.2).
For quantification of lamina-associated condensed chromatin, the surface area of condensed chromatin with direct contact to the lamina was measured by manual tracking. The surface area was subsequently normalized to the nuclear perimeter.
Flipper-TR fluorescent tension probe (Spirochrome, SC020) was utilized to quantify membrane tension ( Colom et al., 2018 20. Colom, A. ∙ Derivery, E. ∙ Soleimanpour, S. ... A fluorescent membrane tension probe Nat. Chem. 2018; 10 :1118-1125 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ). To stain the outer nuclear membranes, 1 μM Flipper-TR was applied 16 h prior to initiating cell stretching and subsequent FLIM measurements. Elastomers were mounted on the microscope directly after stretching and imaged for maximum 10 min. FLIM imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope equipped with a time correlated single photon counting module from PicoQuant. Zen Black and SymPhoTime 64 software were used to record the data in photon-counting mode using a 40x Plan-Apochromat 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. Excitation was performed using a pulsed 488 nm laser operating at 20 MHz with emission collected through bandpass 565/610 nm filter gated with a GaAsP detector and a TimeHarp 260 PICO board. FLIMfit 5.1.1. software (Imperial College London) was used to fit fluorescence decay data from regions of interest to a dual exponential model after deconvolution for the instrument response function/IRF, measured using backscattered emission light of a saturated Erythrosin B with KI. The longest lifetime with the higher fit amplitude was used to quantify membrane tension.
For Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature then washed with 0.1% sodium borohydride for 5 min then twice with PBS. Samples were then blocked and stained as described above for immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (using exclusively Alexa-647 as a secondary antibody) following a post-stain with 3% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde and subsequent three washes in PBS. Samples were then stored at 4°C until imaging. Imaging was performed in β-mercaptoethanol/glucose oxidase/catalase buffer on a GE Deltavision OMX SR using a 63X Apo N 60x/1.49 NA oil TIRF objective. Image reconstruction was performed using Thunder STORM Fiji plugin ( Ovesný et al., 2014 61. Ovesný, M. ∙ Křížek, P. ∙ Borkovec, J. ... ThunderSTORM: a comprehensive ImageJ plug-in for PALM and STORM data analysis and super-resolution imaging Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2389-2390 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM) cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, and subjected to immunofluorescence as described above using Alexa 488 and 561 secondary antibodies. Samples were mounted in hardening Prolong Glass mounting media (Thermo P36982) on high performance coverslips (Zeiss) and allowed to cure for 2 days at room temperature prior to imaging in order to draw silicone substrates close to the coverslips. Imaging was performed on GE Deltavision OMX SR using 1.520 oil with PlanApo N 60X/1.42 Oil. Image reconstruction was performed using SoftWoRx 7.0 software.
For live imaging of intracellular Ca 2+ , Cal-590 AM calcium dye (2 μM; AAT Bioquest 20510) was applied on cells for 10 min at 37°C, then washed twice with PBS and imaged in fresh medium 20 min post staining. For real-time nuclear deformation measurements, cells were stained with 1μM live cell nuclear dye (Vybrant; Thermo Fisher V35004). Cells were imaged using a 20X/0.45 PlanFL N air objective and a CoolSnap HQ2 camera mounted on an inverted Olympus IX73 epifluorescence microscope, with the uniaxial stretch device described above mounted on the microscope stage. Images were acquired with PVCamTest software version 3.4.183. Images were acquired continuously under basal conditions and during stretch, after which the effect of bleaching was corrected by normalizing all fluorescence signals to corresponding background fluorescence signals.
RNA was isolated using the Nucleospin RNA Plus kit (Macherey&Nagel), after which cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). qPCR was performed on the StepOne Plus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the DyNAmo ColorFlash SYBR Green Mix (Thermo Fisher). Gene expression changes were calculated following normalization to B2M using the comparative Ct (cycle threshold) method. The primers used are provided in Table S4 .
Compression was performed with a previously published cell confiner system ( Le Berre et al., 2012 41. Le Berre, M. ∙ Aubertin, J. ∙ Piel, M. Fine control of nuclear confinement identifies a threshold deformation leading to lamina rupture and induction of specific genes Integr. Biol. 2012; 4 :1406-1414 Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar ). Briefly, suction cup-bound coverslips with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillars of either 4.2 μm (about 20% compression) or 20 μm (uncompressed controls) height, based on nuclear height measured from live cells, were driven on top of EPC monolayers using a controlled pressure pump (Elveflow). Compression was held on the nuclei for 15 minutes in the presence/absence of chemical treatments, as indicated, and fixation in 4% PFA was performed directly at the end of the compression period.
Embryonic day 15.5 NMRI embryos were isolated and their full-thickness back skin was excised. The skin biopsies were placed in keratinocyte growth medium ( Chacón-Martínez et al., 2017 16. Chacón-Martínez, C.A. ∙ Klose, M. ∙ Niemann, C. ... Hair follicle stem cell cultures reveal self-organizing plasticity of stem cells and their progeny EMBO J. 2017; 36 :151-164 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), attached to silicon elastomers using small pins and subjected to 40% uniaxial cyclic stretch parallel to the medial-lateral axis. Control skins were treated in identical manner without mechanical stretch. Cell viability and tissue integrity after stretch was confirmed by histology and cleaved caspase-3 staining.
Tissue biopsies were subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1h at room temperature after which whole mount stainings were performed as described above for immunofluorescence staining, with the exception of stronger permeabilization (0.6% Triton X-100 in PBS) and overnight primary antibody incubation being carried out at 37C°.
Limbs from E15.5 NMRI embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature and embedded in paraffin. 8 μm sections were cut with a microtome and deparaffinized using standard protocols. After antigen retrieval in citrate buffer using a pressure cooker, sections were blocked with 5% goat serum/3%BSA and subjected to immunofluorescence staining and analysis as described above.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, version 8). Statistical significance was determined by the specific tests indicated in the corresponding figure legends. In all cases where a test for normally distributed data was used, normal distribution was confirmed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (α = 0.05). All experiments presented in the manuscript were repeated at least in 3 independent experiments/biological replicates. No datapoints were excluded from the analyses.
