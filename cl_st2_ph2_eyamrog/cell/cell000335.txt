Title: Simultaneous binding of Guidance Cues NET1 and RGM blocks extracellular NEO1 signaling


Abstract: Summary

During cell migration or differentiation, cell surface receptors are simultaneously exposed to different ligands. However, it is often unclear how these extracellular signals are integrated. Neogenin (NEO1) acts as an attractive guidance receptor when the Netrin-1 (NET1) ligand binds, but it mediates repulsion via repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) ligands. Here, we show that signal integration occurs through the formation of a ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex, which triggers reciprocal silencing of downstream signaling. Our NEO1-NET1-RGM structures reveal a “trimer-of-trimers” super-assembly, which exists in the cell membrane. Super-assembly formation results in inhibition of RGMA-NEO1-mediated growth cone collapse and RGMA- or NET1-NEO1-mediated neuron migration, by preventing formation of signaling-compatible RGM-NEO1 complexes and NET1-induced NEO1 ectodomain clustering. These results illustrate how simultaneous binding of ligands with opposing functions, to a single receptor, does not lead to competition for binding, but to formation of a super-complex that diminishes their functional outputs.

Section: Introduction

During their lifespan, cells are exposed to a plethora of cues that control processes such as cell division, differentiation, migration, and death. Often, these cues are presented simultaneously to bind specific cell surface receptors and activate downstream signaling pathways. Despite recent progress, how this wealth of extracellular information is integrated and controlled remains poorly understood. A remarkable example of such integration is represented by the receptor Neogenin (NEO1) and its two ligands, repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) and Netrin-1 (NET1). NEO1 is a single-pass transmembrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily ( Wilson and Key, 2007 106. Wilson, N.H. ∙ Key, B. Neogenin: one receptor, many functions Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39 :874-878 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), composed of 4 N-terminal Ig-like domains, followed by 6 fibronectin type III-like domains, a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular domain. It is implicated in inflammation ( Fujita and Yamashita, 2017 29. Fujita, Y. ∙ Yamashita, T. The roles of RGMa-neogenin signaling in inflammation and angiogenesis Inflamm.

The Netrin/RGM receptor, Neogenin, controls adult neurogenesis by promoting neuroblast migration and cell cycle exit Stem Cells. 2015; 33 :503-514 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). To mediate these functions, NEO1 binds structurally and functionally distinct ligands such as RGM and NET1.
Interactions between NEO1 and all three members of the GPI-anchored RGM family (RGMA, RGMB/Dragon, RGMC/Hemojuvelin/HFE2) are mediated by FN domains 5 and 6 of NEO1, forming the core of a signal transduction hub for RGM-mediated repulsive guidance through the plasma membrane. Two RGM molecules act as molecular staples to bring together the juxtamembrane regions of two NEO1 receptors into a signaling-competent dimer ( Bell et al., 2013 10.

Binding of RGM to NEO1 triggers rearrangements of the cytoskeleton via Rho GTPases and other effectors, and it results in, e.g., growth cone collapse ( Conrad et al., 2007 18.

NET1 and RGMs show partially overlapping expression patterns in different tissues, including the neural tube and nervous system.

At the cellular level, NET1 and RGMs cause opposing effects via NEO1 (e.g. cell attraction versus repulsion). As both ligands bind to the NEO1 FN domains, their signaling needs to be spatiotemporally controlled. Simultaneous exposure of NEO1 to RGMs and NET1 occurs during neural tube closure, axon guidance, neuron migration, and other processes ( Kee et al., 2008 46. Kee, N. ∙ Wilson, N. ∙ De Vries, M. ...

Neogenin interacts with RGMa and netrin-1 to guide axons within the embryonic vertebrate forebrain Dev. Biol. 2006; 296 :485-498 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), and NET1 and RGMs can functionally interact. For example, RGMA is a repulsive guidance cue for NEO1-positive cortical interneurons migrating out of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) of the ventral forebrain. Interestingly, NET1 expression in the MGE silences the repulsive effects of RGMA-NEO1 signaling ( O’Leary et al., 2013 76. O’Leary, C. ∙ Cole, S.J. ∙ Langford, M. ... RGMa regulates cortical interneuron migration and differentiation PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e81711 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite these insights, the molecular mechanisms explaining how both ligands activate NEO1, and how these guidance cues cross-talk to transduce their signals, remain elusive.
Here, we determined the structure of an unexpected ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex that forms a defined and stable “trimer-of-trimers” assembly. We show that formation of the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex inhibits both RGMA-NEO1-mediated growth cone collapse and RGMA-NEO1- and NET1-NEO1-mediated neuron migration. Our data demonstrate that NET1 and RGMs can bind simultaneously to NEO1 rather than competing for binding, thereby unveiling an intriguing mode of receptor regulation. The ternary structure acts as a silencing complex, preventing the formation of the signaling-compatible RGM-NEO1 complex as well as NET1-induced NEO1 ectodomain clustering, both required for signal transduction. Thus, our work reveals how two ligands with distinct and opposing cellular functions can control their receptor by reciprocal silencing of downstream signaling pathways. This mechanism is likely to apply more generally, as other receptors are also known to bind structurally and functionally distinct ligands.

Section: Results

To dissect the molecular mechanisms that control NEO1 signaling via interactions with RGM and NET1, we identified the minimal binding regions for the NET1-NEO1 interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cell surface binding experiments ( Figures S1 A–S1D). Our data show that the minimal complex is composed of the three membrane proximal FN domains of NEO1 (NEO1 FN456 ) and a NET1 construct lacking the C-terminal NTR domain (NET1 ΔNTR ) ( Figure 1 A), in line with previous biochemical studies ( Geisbrecht et al., 2003 30.

Structures of netrin-1 bound to two receptors provide insight into its axon guidance mechanism Science. 2014; 344 :1275-1279 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously mapped the RGM-binding region on NEO1 to the two membrane-proximal FN domains (NEO1 FN56 ) ( Bell et al., 2013 10. Bell, C.H. ∙ Healey, E. ∙ van Erp, S. ...

Since cells can simultaneously encounter RGMs and NET1 in a NEO1-dependent manner in vivo ( Kee et al., 2008 46. Kee, N. ∙ Wilson, N. ∙ De Vries, M. ...

Neogenin interacts with RGMa and netrin-1 to guide axons within the embryonic vertebrate forebrain Dev. Biol. 2006; 296 :485-498 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), we asked whether a stable ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex can exist at the cell surface, or whether NET1 and RGM would compete for NEO1 binding. To distinguish between these two options, we carried out in situ proximity ligation assays (PLAs) ( Söderberg et al., 2006 94. Söderberg, O. ∙ Gullberg, M. ∙ Jarvius, M. ... Direct observation of individual endogenous protein complexes in situ by proximity ligation Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 :995-1000 Crossref Scopus (1576) PubMed Google Scholar ). We mutually incubated full-length NEO1 expressing cells with purified NET1 ΔNTR and the full-length ectodomain of RGMB (RGMB ECD ) and observed numerous PLA foci, which can only be generated when NET1 and RGMB come into close proximity (<40nm) ( Figures 1 B and 1C). The number of foci was diminished when wild type RGMB was replaced with a RGMB mutant (RGMB-A186R [ Healey et al., 2015 38. Healey, E.G. ∙ Bishop, B. ∙ Elegheert, J. ... Repulsive guidance molecule is a structural bridge between neogenin and bone morphogenetic protein Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :458-465 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ]) that cannot efficiently bind to NEO1 ( Figures 1 B and 1C). This result suggests that NEO1 is specifically required for bridging NET1 and RGMB and that a complex of RGMB, NET1, and NEO1 forms on the cell surface. This scenario describes signaling in “ trans ,” whereby RGM and NEO1 are expressed in different cells, for example in RGM-mediated axon guidance. We also observed a high number of foci from NET1-RGMB interactions when full-length RGMB (RGMB FL ) and NEO1 are co-transfected in the presence of soluble NET1 ΔNTR ( Figures S1 E and S1F). This shows that the ternary complex can also form in “ cis ,” a situation occurring in hepatocytes or chondrocytes ( Zhang et al., 2009 116. Zhang, A.S. ∙ Yang, F. ∙ Wang, J. ...

Cell. 2010; 19 :90-102 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ) where the RGM-NEO1 complex regulates BMP signaling. It remains to be seen what the effect of NET1 in these signaling scenarios is.
To understand how NEO1, NET1, and RGMB assemble into a ternary complex, we determined the crystal structure of the minimal ternary NEO1-NET1-RGMB complex, composed of NEO1 FN456 , NET1 ΔNTR and the RGMB NEO1-binding region (RGMB CORE ) ( Figure 1 D; Methods S1 ; Table S1 ) to 3.25 Å resolution. Strikingly, this ternary complex is assembled into a 3:3:3 stoichiometry, composed of three 1:1:1 “protomer” complexes arranged around a 3-fold symmetry axis ( Figure 1 D and Figure 2 A). To test whether such a “trimer-of-trimers” arrangement can exist in solution, we carried out analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) ( Figure 2 B) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) ( Figure 2 C) analyses. Both methods suggest the assembly of a 3:3:3 NEO1-NET1-RGMB complex as the major species.
We further interrogated stoichiometry and architecture of the ternary complex using size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The ternary complex composed of NEO1 FN456 , NET1 ΔNTR and RGMB ECD could be readily formed on SEC ( Figures S2 A–S2D). The peak fraction contained all three proteins and was further analyzed using SEC-MALS. The experimentally determined molecular weight (MW) (422.7 ± 2.8 kDa) matched the calculated MW of the glycosylated complex (433 kDa) confirming the presence of the 3:3:3 assembly in solution ( Figure S2 B). We further analyzed the same sample with cryo-EM ( Methods S2 ). Single particle analysis of the NET1-NEO1-RGMB complex revealed their trimeric symmetry ( Figure 2 D), consistent with the complex determined by crystallography ( Figure 2 A). We reconstructed a cryo-EM map to 6.0 Å resolution in which the crystallographic 3:3:3 complex could be readily fitted ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Using a similar SEC-MALS experiment as for RGMB, we could show that the full-length extracellular domains of the other two human RGM family members RGMA and RGMC form ternary complexes with NEO1 FN456 and NET1 ( Figures S2 E–S2H) suggestive of ternary 3:3:3 RGM-NEO1-NET1 architecture.
The backbone of the “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex is essentially formed by interactions between NEO1 and NET1. NET1 is an elongated and rigid molecule, making contacts with two neighboring NEO1 molecules in order to bridge individual NEO1-NET1-RGM protomers within the super-complex ( Figures 2 A and 3 A and Figures S3 A and S3B). The NET1 LN domain (NET1 LN ) forms the major interaction site with NEO1, binding to NEO1 FN4 (“Interface-1,” Figure 3 A, right panel). The combined buried surface area between NET1 LN and NEO1 FN4 is 686 Å 2 and involves predominantly hydrophobic interactions, with NET1 residue F55 in the center. The second interface is formed by the NET1 LE3 of the same NET1 molecule and a neighboring NEO1 FN5 domain. In contrast to “Interface-1,” this interaction is of a predominantly hydrophilic nature with a buried surface area of 572 Å 2 (“Interface-2,” Figure 3 A, left panel). Both interfaces are highly conserved amongst NEO1 orthologues ( Figures S3 A and S3B). The NEO1 FN5 and FN6 domains interact with RGMB, as observed in our previous structural analysis of binary NEO1-RGM complexes, via the high-affinity “site 1” interface ( Bell et al., 2013 10. Bell, C.H. ∙ Healey, E. ∙ van Erp, S. ... Structure of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM)-neogenin signaling hub Science. 2013; 341 :77-80 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 4 N-linked sugars and 4 non-covalently linked sucrose-octasulfate (SOS) molecules are bound at the complex surface ( Figures S3 C–S3G). The NET1 ΔNTR and RGMB CORE molecules form a very minor interaction ( Figure S3 H), but no binding was observed between NET1 ΔNTR and the ectodomains of RGMA and RGMB in solution ( Figures S3 I–S3L). This suggests that NET1-NEO1 interactions are the driving force for the formation of the “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex.
In order to verify our observed NET1-NEO1 interfaces, we designed NET1 mutants to ablate specific interaction sites and tested these for NEO1 binding in SPR ( Figure 3 B, Figures S3 M, and 3 N). When compared to wild-type NET1 ΔNTR , NET1 ΔNTR F55R (“NET1-Interface-1” mutant) designed to disrupt NET1-NEO1 “Interface-1” ( Figure 3 A, right panel), bound to NEO1 FN456 with an approximately ten-fold lower affinity but did not change NET1 binding to NEO1 FN56 . On the other hand, NET1 ΔNTR Q443N/R445T (“NET1-Interface-2”), designed to introduce an Asn443-linked glycan to disrupt the NET1 LE3 -NEO1 FN5 interface, abolished binding to NEO1 FN56 ( Figure 3 B) and reduced NEO1 FN456 binding approximately two-fold ( Figures S3 M and S3N). This supports the model of two independent NET1-NEO1 binding interfaces, as observed in our complex structure. We also tested the effects of the NET1 ΔNTR Interface-1 and -2 mutants using AUC ( Figure 3 C). Both NET1 mutant complexes with NEO1 FN456 and RGMB ECD abolished the “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex, in agreement with our observation that both NET1-NEO1 interface 1 and 2 are necessary to form the super-complex.
To assess the functional impact of NET1 on the NEO1-RGM interaction, we confirmed that RGMA, RGMB, NET1, and NEO1 expression patterns in the nervous system allow interactions between these molecules in a “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex. We found widespread overlap in the distribution and expression of RGMs, NET1, and NEO1 in various brain regions of the adult mouse brain, including in the thalamus, cortex, and cerebellum ( Figures S4 A–S4C). For example, in line with previous data, these molecules were localized to cell types in the ventricular-subventricular zone, such as astrocytes and neurons, that reside in close proximity and that functionally interact ( Figure S4 D). Furthermore, RGMB, NET1, and NEO1 also displayed overlapping expression in different regions of the embryonic brain, including the striatum ( Figure 3 D). Next, we assessed whether RGMs, NET1, and NEO1 are present in the same protein complex in brain tissue. We performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of RGMB from adult mouse cortex followed by detection of RGMB, NET1, and NEO1. As predicted by the PLA experiments ( Figures 1 B and 1C) and expression data ( Figures 3 D and S4 A), NEO1 and NET1 were co-immunoprecipitated with RGMB ( Figure 3 E). These observations, together with our data showing lack of RGMB-NET1 and RGMB-DCC binding ( Figures S3 K and S3L) ( Bell et al., 2013 10. Bell, C.H. ∙ Healey, E. ∙ van Erp, S. ... Structure of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM)-neogenin signaling hub Science. 2013; 341 :77-80 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggest that RGMs, NET1, and NEO1 co-exist in multimeric protein complexes on neural cells.
To investigate the functional role of these protein complexes, we first used an NEO1-dependent growth collapse assay in which dissociated cortical neurons (CNs) were exposed to RGMA in the absence or presence of NET1 proteins ( van Erp et al., 2015 101. van Erp, S. ∙ van den Heuvel, D.M.A. ∙ Fujita, Y. ... Lrig2 Negatively Regulates Ectodomain Shedding of Axon Guidance Receptors by ADAM Proteases Dev. Cell. 2015; 35 :537-552 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 F and 3G). CNs express NEO1 ( Figure S5 A), and addition of RGMA induced CN growth cone collapse ( van Erp et al., 2015 101. van Erp, S. ∙ van den Heuvel, D.M.A. ∙ Fujita, Y. ... Lrig2 Negatively Regulates Ectodomain Shedding of Axon Guidance Receptors by ADAM Proteases Dev. Cell. 2015; 35 :537-552 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). This inhibitory effect of RGMA was diminished when CNs were simultaneously exposed to RGMA and wild type NET1 ΔNTR , suggesting that NET1 can inhibit RGMA-mediated growth cone collapse. In contrast, when CNs were incubated with RGMA and either NET1 interface-1 or interface-2 mutant, RGMA-mediated growth cone collapse was unaffected ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Since embryonic CNs express NEO1 and DCC ( Figure S5 A), we confirmed that the observed effect of NET1 was independent of the NET1 receptor DCC (that shares some 80% sequence similarity to NEO1). We crossed Emx1-IRES-cre mice with Dcc fl/fl mice ( Krimpenfort et al., 2012 50. Krimpenfort, P. ∙ Song, J.Y. ∙ Proost, N. ... Deleted in colorectal carcinoma suppresses metastasis in p53-deficient mammary tumours Nature. 2012; 482 :538-541 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), to delete Dcc from CNs ( Gorski et al., 2002 32. Gorski, J.A. ∙ Talley, T. ∙ Qiu, M. ... Cortical excitatory neurons and glia, but not GABAergic neurons, are produced in the Emx1-expressing lineage J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 :6309-6314 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Liang et al., 2012 57. Liang, H. ∙ Hippenmeyer, S. ∙ Ghashghaei, H.T. A Nestin-cre transgenic mouse is insufficient for recombination in early embryonic neural progenitors Biol. Open. 2012; 1 :1200-1203 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed no difference in RGMA-induced growth cone collapse and NET1 rescue in Dcc lox/lox ; Emx1 cre/wt compared to Dcc lox/wt ; Emx1 wt/wt CNs ( Figure S5 B). Taken together, our functional and structural analyses suggest a mechanism for NET1-mediated inhibition of NEO1-RGM signaling, whereby the formation of the NEO1-NET1-RGM “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex is the driving force as it is incompatible with NEO1 dimerization and subsequent downstream signal activation ( Figure 3 H–3J).
We next determined the crystal structure of the binary complex between NEO1 FN456 and NET1 ΔNTR ( Figure 4 A; Table S1 ). The observed NEO1 FN456 :NET1 ΔNTR interfaces are equivalent to the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGMB complex, with NET1 linking two separate NEO1 molecules via their FN4 and FN5 domains respectively ( Figure 4 A). The NEO1 FN56 structural unit is positioned differently when compared to the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM structure, undergoing a rotation of some 130 o around the FN4-5 interdomain linker ( Figure S6 A). Interface-1 and -2 determinants resemble that of our ternary complex and are also observed in a previously reported crystal structure of the chick NET1 ΔNTR with NEO1 FN45 ( Xu et al., 2014 111. Xu, K. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Renier, N. ... Neural migration. Structures of netrin-1 bound to two receptors provide insight into its axon guidance mechanism Science. 2014; 344 :1275-1279 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 B). However, we did not observe a 2:2 hetero-tetrameric arrangement as in the chick NET1-NEO1 structure, mediated by an antiparallel NET1 dimer. NET1 ΔNTR exists as a monomer at concentrations up to 81 μM when analyzed by SAXS ( Figures S6 B–S6G), in agreement with previous NET analyses ( Finci et al., 2014 28. Finci, L.I. ∙ Krüger, N. ∙ Sun, X. ...

Commun. 2016; 7 :13515 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Crystal packing analysis of our binary NET1-NEO1 complex suggests a continuous NET1-NEO1 arrangement generated by a crystallographic two-fold axis, mediated by NET1-NEO1 interface 1 and 2 ( Fig. 4 C). This suggests a ligand-induced receptor clustering mechanism, resulting in a similar arrangement to that proposed for the NET1-DCC complex ( Xu et al., 2014 111. Xu, K. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Renier, N. ... Neural migration. Structures of netrin-1 bound to two receptors provide insight into its axon guidance mechanism Science. 2014; 344 :1275-1279 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 D). In both complexes, interfaces 1 and 2 are highly conserved ( Figure S6 H). Our SPR analysis using NET1 interface-1 and-2 mutants is in agreement with this model, with equivalent NET1-binding properties observed for DCC ( Figures S6 I and S6J) as for NEO1 ( Figure 3 B).
To validate the NET1-NEO1 clustering model, we performed AUC analysis of the NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR complex. We observed a concentration-dependent shift of the complex towards higher molecular weights (10–15 S), indicative of NET1 ΔNTR -induced NEO1 clustering ( Figure 4 E). This was inhibited by mutations in both NET1-NEO1 interface 1 and 2 ( Figure 4 F). In support of this finding, analysis of the NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR complex using SAXS gave a notable difference in scattering profile and calculated molecular weight at different concentrations ( Figure 4 G). Our data support a cell surface receptor oligomerization model in which a single NET1 molecule links two NEO1/DCC receptors together, leading to NEO1/DCC clustering in a concentration-dependent manner.
RGMA is a repulsive guidance cue for cortical interneurons migrating out of the MGE and it induces growth cone collapse in CNs. In line with our discovery of the “trimer-of-trimers” silencing complex, these effects can be silenced by NET1 ( O’Leary et al., 2013 76. O’Leary, C. ∙ Cole, S.J. ∙ Langford, M. ... RGMa regulates cortical interneuron migration and differentiation PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e81711 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 F and 3G). To functionally examine the NET1-NEO1 interaction and to test whether RGMs can inhibit NET1-mediated NEO1 signaling, we cultured mouse subventricular zone neurospheres (SVZ-NSCs) on different NET1 variants. NET1 and RGMA are expressed along the migratory route of mouse SVZ-neuroblasts en route to the olfactory bulb in the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and NET1 promotes SVZ-neuroblast migration in vitro ( Bradford et al., 2010 11. Bradford, D. ∙ Faull, R.L. ∙ Curtis, M.A. ... Characterization of the netrin/RGMa receptor neogenin in neurogenic regions of the mouse and human adult forebrain J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518 :3237-3253 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; O’Leary et al., 2015 77. O’Leary, C.J. ∙ Bradford, D. ∙ Chen, M. ... The Netrin/RGM receptor, Neogenin, controls adult neurogenesis by promoting neuroblast migration and cell cycle exit Stem Cells. 2015; 33 :503-514 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). This migration assay allows testing of NET1-NEO1 signaling output, because SVZ-neuroblasts express NEO1 and rely on this receptor for NET1-mediated migration ( Figures 5 A and 5B) ( O’Leary et al., 2015 77. O’Leary, C.J. ∙ Bradford, D. ∙ Chen, M. ... The Netrin/RGM receptor, Neogenin, controls adult neurogenesis by promoting neuroblast migration and cell cycle exit Stem Cells. 2015; 33 :503-514 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ).
SVZ-NSCs grown on full-length NET1 (NET1 FL ) showed a significant increase in the number of migrating neurons compared to control substrate ( Figures 5 C and 5D), in line with previous work ( O’Leary et al., 2015 77. O’Leary, C.J. ∙ Bradford, D. ∙ Chen, M. ... The Netrin/RGM receptor, Neogenin, controls adult neurogenesis by promoting neuroblast migration and cell cycle exit Stem Cells. 2015; 33 :503-514 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, NET1 ΔNTR (that inhibits RGM-mediated growth cone collapse [ Figure 3 G]) was not sufficient to activate NEO1-depenent cell migration ( Figures 5 E and 5F), suggesting a crucial role of the NET1 C-terminal NTR domain, potentially because it interacts with heparan sulphate proteoglycans ( Kappler et al., 2000 45. Kappler, J. ∙ Franken, S. ∙ Junghans, U. ... Glycosaminoglycan-binding properties and secondary structure of the C-terminus of netrin-1 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271 :287-291 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). When NET1 FL interface-1 or -2 mutants were used no enhanced migration was observed, in agreement with our structural and biophysical analyses and supporting that both NET1-NEO1 interfaces are essential for function ( Figures 5 C and 5D).
Next, we examined whether RGMA can counteract the positive effect of NET1 on neuron migration and found that RGMA blocked the promotion of SVZ-neuroblast migration by NET1 FL in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figures 6 A and 6B, Figures S5 C–S5G). Addition of RGMA had no effect on neuroblast proliferation or differentiation ( Figures 6 C–6F). Furthermore, we showed that NET1 could induce neuroblast migration following DCC ablation while RGMA could still inhibit this effect ( Figures 6 G and 6H, Figures S5 C–S5G; data not shown). RGMB also blocked the promotion of SVZ-neuroblast migration by NET1 ( Figures 6 I and 6J) suggesting a general effect of RGMs.
Finally, we assessed whether interactions between RGM and NET1 can lead to silencing of their individual biological effects in vivo . In the embryonic cortex, RGMA acts as a repulsive cue for migrating CNs via NEO1 ( van Erp et al., 2015 101. van Erp, S. ∙ van den Heuvel, D.M.A. ∙ Fujita, Y. ... Lrig2 Negatively Regulates Ectodomain Shedding of Axon Guidance Receptors by ADAM Proteases Dev. Cell. 2015; 35 :537-552 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). NET1 promotes the migration of various types of neurons and displays very low expression in the cortex ( Brignani et al., 2020 13. Brignani, S. ∙ Raj, D.D.A. ∙ Schmidt, E.R.E. ...

Netrin-1 Confines Rhombic Lip-Derived Neurons to the CNS Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :1666-1680 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We designed an in utero electroporation (IUE) study to examine whether NET1 could silence the repulsive effect of RGMA on cortical neuron migration in vivo . Expression constructs for RGMA or NET1 (in combination with a GFP plasmid for visualization) were electroporated at E14 following which the pregnant mothers received a pulse of EdU at E15. EdU labelling enabled analysis of neurons that would migrate into a region of strong RGMA expression (±NET1 expression) that was generated by IUE at E14. Expression vectors were targeted to neuronal progenitors in the VZ at E14, followed by immunostaining at E16 or E17 ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Three days after GFP electroporation, EdU + neurons were found throughout the cortex, including in the upper CP ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Electroporation of RGMA created a non-permissive zone for subsequent EdU + neurons, resulting in a reduction of the number of EdU + neurons in upper cortical areas (quantified in the CP) ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Electroporation of NET1 also reduced the migration of EdU + neurons, most likely because neurons got trapped in deeper regions exogenously expressing this attractive cue ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Knockdown of NEO1 partially rescued the reduced migration of EdU + neurons, indicating that the NET1-mediated effect requires NEO1 ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Finally, we tested co-electroporation of RGMA and NET1 and failed to detect a reduction in CN migration, both following analysis of EdU + and GFP + neurons ( Figures 7 C and 7D, Figures S5 H–S5J). These data together with our observations from growth cone collapse and SVZ-NSC experiments ( Figures 3 , 5 , and 6 ) and work by others ( O’Leary et al., 2013 76. O’Leary, C. ∙ Cole, S.J. ∙ Langford, M. ... RGMa regulates cortical interneuron migration and differentiation PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e81711 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggest that simultaneous binding of the functionally competing ligands NET1 and RGM blocks NEO1 receptor signaling.

Section: Discussion

Many guidance receptors bind multiple ligands, but how signaling downstream of these ligand-receptor interactions is integrated remains poorly understood ( Dudanova and Klein, 2013 23. Dudanova, I. ∙ Klein, R. Integration of guidance cues: parallel signaling and crosstalk Trends Neurosci. 2013; 36 :295-304 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morales and Kania, 2017 69. Morales, D. ∙ Kania, A. Cooperation and crosstalk in axon guidance cue integration: Additivity, synergy, and fine-tuning in combinatorial signaling Dev. Neurobiol. 2017; 77 :891-904 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we determine structures of a ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex and show that the guidance cues RGM and NET1 can bind simultaneously to NEO1 in a “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex. This ternary complex exists at the cell membrane, and its formation inhibits both RGMA-NEO1-mediated growth cone collapse and RGMA- and NET1-NEO1-mediated cell migration in vitro and in vivo . The ternary structure acts as a silencing complex, preventing formation of the signaling-compatible RGM-NEO1 complex and NET1-induced NEO1 ectodomain clustering. These results illustrate how simultaneous binding of structurally distinct ligands with specific cellular functions to a single receptor can lead to the formation of a complex that silences downstream signaling.
NEO1 is a multi-domain receptor with various interaction partners and signaling outputs. NEO1 oligomerization is required for signaling, with the 2:2 NEO1:RGM signaling compatible complex triggering growth cone collapse and cell repulsion ( Bell et al., 2013 10. Bell, C.H. ∙ Healey, E. ∙ van Erp, S. ... Structure of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM)-neogenin signaling hub Science. 2013; 341 :77-80 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 E, middle). This process can be potentiated by BMP morphogens ( Tassew et al., 2014 98. Tassew, N.G. ∙ Mothe, A.J. ∙ Shabanzadeh, A.P. ... Modifying lipid rafts promotes regeneration and functional recovery Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :1146-1159 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), with RGM acting as a physical link bridging BMP and NEO1, inducing NEO1 clustering ( Healey et al., 2015 38. Healey, E.G. ∙ Bishop, B. ∙ Elegheert, J. ... Repulsive guidance molecule is a structural bridge between neogenin and bone morphogenetic protein Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :458-465 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 E, right). NET1 binding to NEO1 or the NEO1 orthologue DCC can trigger attractive guidance responses, and NET1-DCC binding induces receptor clustering ( Stein et al., 2001 96. Stein, E. ∙ Zou, Y. ∙ Poo, M. ... Binding of DCC by netrin-1 to mediate axon guidance independent of adenosine A2B receptor activation Science. 2001; 291 :1976-1982 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2014 111. Xu, K. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Renier, N. ... Neural migration. Structures of netrin-1 bound to two receptors provide insight into its axon guidance mechanism Science. 2014; 344 :1275-1279 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show that the binary NET1-NEO1 complex behaves in a similar way ( Figure 7 E, left), suggesting that NET1-induced chemoattraction is triggered by NEO1 receptor clustering. Despite both ligands binding in the juxtamembrane FN4-6 region, our data show that RGM and NET1 simultaneously target independent conserved binding sites on NEO1 and trigger a unique receptor conformation incompatible with the 2:2 NEO1-RGM and clustered NET1-NEO1 oligomeric states. This creates a “crossroads” between NET1-NEO1 and NEO1-RGM complexes at the cell surface with a NEO1-NET1-RGM “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex fine-tuning the output of this fundamental signaling pathway ( Figure 7 F). In this context, two functionally competing ligands (NET1 and RGM) act to block NEO1 signaling by forming a silencing complex.
The “primary” receptor for NET1 has long been thought to be DCC. However, recent studies revealed that NET1 can mediate chemoattractive responses through NEO1 ( Huyghe et al., 2020 41. Huyghe, A. ∙ Furlan, G. ∙ Ozmadenci, D. ... Netrin-1 promotes naive pluripotency through Neo1 and Unc5b co-regulation of Wnt and MAPK signalling Nat. Cell Biol. 2020; 22 :389-400 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; O’Leary et al., 2015 77. O’Leary, C.J. ∙ Bradford, D. ∙ Chen, M. ... The Netrin/RGM receptor, Neogenin, controls adult neurogenesis by promoting neuroblast migration and cell cycle exit Stem Cells. 2015; 33 :503-514 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2014 111. Xu, K. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Renier, N. ... Neural migration. Structures of netrin-1 bound to two receptors provide insight into its axon guidance mechanism Science. 2014; 344 :1275-1279 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 and 6 ). Our binary NET1-NEO1 complex structure resembles the overall architecture of the binary DCC-NET1 complex ( Xu et al., 2014 111. Xu, K. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Renier, N. ... Neural migration. Structures of netrin-1 bound to two receptors provide insight into its axon guidance mechanism Science. 2014; 344 :1275-1279 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealing two highly conserved interfaces—a high-affinity interaction site of NET1 with the DCC/NEO1-FN4 domain (interface 1) and a lower affinity interaction with the DCC/NEO1-FN5 domain (interface 2) —that are both crucial for interactions and function. Both arrangements suggest NET1-mediated clustering of DCC/NEO1 is important for downstream signaling. Our analysis of binary NET1-receptor complexes supports a conserved binding mode and mechanism of signaling activation between NET1 and both NEO1 and DCC.
We previously showed that the binding affinity of RGMB for DCC is approximately 1,000-fold lower than for NEO1 ( Bell et al., 2013 10. Bell, C.H. ∙ Healey, E. ∙ van Erp, S. ... Structure of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM)-neogenin signaling hub Science. 2013; 341 :77-80 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite sharing over 80% similarity with the NEO1 minimal RGM-binding region (NEO1-FN 5-6 ), DCC lacks a RGM interface loop present in NEO1-FN5 and therefore acting as a specificity determinant for NEO1-RGM binding. In agreement with the lack of a physiologically relevant DCC-RGM interaction, here we show that knockout of DCC in CNs has no effect on RGMA-induced growth cone collapse nor on the ability of NET1 to modulate this effect. DCC deletion did not affect NET1-mediated SVZ-neuroblast migration nor the ability of RGMA or RGMB to inhibit this effect. This supports the idea that inhibition by RGMs is likely attributed to the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex. The divergent evolution of NEO1 alongside DCC may be explained by a requirement for the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex in signal transduction, compartmentalized separately from DCC to specifically regulate inhibition of RGM signaling.
RGM and NET1 expression patterns frequently overlap, e.g. during neural tube closure or in the more developed central nervous system ( Kee et al., 2008 46. Kee, N. ∙ Wilson, N. ∙ De Vries, M. ...

Neogenin interacts with RGMa and netrin-1 to guide axons within the embryonic vertebrate forebrain Dev. Biol. 2006; 296 :485-498 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 D and S5 4). Initial work implied competitive binding between NET1 and RGMA on NEO1 ( Conrad et al., 2007 18. Conrad, S. ∙ Genth, H. ∙ Hofmann, F. ... Neogenin-RGMa signaling at the growth cone is bone morphogenetic protein-independent and involves RhoA, ROCK, and PKC J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :16423-16433 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data show that instead both ligands can simultaneously bind NEO1 to form a “silencing” complex that blocks downstream signaling and function. Our study, and the work of others, supports a model in which this ternary complex is important for regulating and fine-tuning NEO1-NET1-RGM signaling output. For example, previous work showed that NET1 can inhibit the repulsive effect of RGMA on migrating cortical interneurons ( O’Leary et al., 2013 76. O’Leary, C. ∙ Cole, S.J. ∙ Langford, M. ... RGMa regulates cortical interneuron migration and differentiation PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e81711 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study also reveals that NET1 can silence RGMA-mediated growth cone collapse in CNs, requiring NEO1 ( Okamura et al., 2011 78. Okamura, Y. ∙ Kohmura, E. ∙ Yamashita, T. TACE cleaves neogenin to desensitize cortical neurons to the repulsive guidance molecule Neurosci. Res. 2011; 71 :63-70 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; van Erp et al., 2015 101. van Erp, S. ∙ van den Heuvel, D.M.A. ∙ Fujita, Y. ... Lrig2 Negatively Regulates Ectodomain Shedding of Axon Guidance Receptors by ADAM Proteases Dev. Cell. 2015; 35 :537-552 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) but not DCC. We also show that NET1 can inhibit RGMA-induced inhibition of CN migration in vivo . Importantly, NET1 and RGMA are co-expressed in the MGE and in various (intermediate) target regions of CN axons ( Livesey and Hunt, 1997 59. Livesey, F.J. ∙ Hunt, S.P.

Neurosci. 1997; 8 :417-429 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ; van den Heuvel et al., 2013 100. van den Heuvel, D.M. ∙ Hellemons, A.J. ∙ Pasterkamp, R.J. Spatiotemporal expression of repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs) and their receptor neogenin in the mouse brain PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e55828 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), and thus interneurons and CN axons are exposed simultaneously to both ligands during their migration or growth in vivo , emphasizing the biological relevance of our findings. Vice-versa, RGMA and RGMB inhibited the positive effects of NET1 on SVZ-neuroblast migration. SVZ-neuroblasts express NEO1 and migrate from the VZ through the RMS towards the olfactory bulb in a NET1-dependent and DCC-independent manner, encountering RGMs en route . NET1-mediated SVZ-neuroblast migration is inhibited by RGMA in a dose-dependent manner in vitro ( Figures 5 and 6 ). These data suggest that NET1 and RGMA and RGMB functionally interact and that their simultaneous presentation leads to reciprocal silencing of their downstream effects, in line with the idea that the ternary complex acts to silence receptor signaling.

Central to generating regenerative therapeutics against NEO1 is balancing its role as a dependence receptor with axonal growth inhibition, as has recently been identified for RGM peptides that activate NEO1 but block targeting to membrane raft domains ( Shabanzadeh et al., 2015 92. Shabanzadeh, A.P. ∙ Tassew, N.G. ∙ Szydlowska, K. ...

Having identified the key interaction domains and interfaces that can be targeted by biologics or small molecules, our structural analyses will help modulate RGM and NET1 signaling in human diseases as well as open new therapeutic avenues via specific modulation of cell surface receptor stoichiometries.
Although our study demonstrates that NEO1, NET1, and RGMs can form a “trimer-of-trimers” super-complex that silences the biological effects of NET1 and RGMs downstream of NEO1, there are a few outstanding issues: 1) Given the broad and overlapping roles of RGMs and NET1, it is plausible that the ternary complex functions more generally; e.g., we show that RGMC (not expressed in the brain) can participate in forming the NEO1-NET1-RGM super-complex ( Figures S2 G and S2H). Moreover, other receptors bind structurally distinct ligands, e.g., DCC binds NET1 and Draxin ( Ahmed et al., 2011 4. Ahmed, G. ∙ Shinmyo, Y. ∙ Ohta, K. ... Draxin inhibits axonal outgrowth through the netrin receptor DCC J. Neurosci. 2011; 31 :14018-14023 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2018 58.

Beamish, I.V. ∙ Hinck, L. ∙ Kennedy, T.E. Making Connections: Guidance Cues and Receptors at Nonneural Cell-Cell Junctions Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10 :a029165 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ; Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2015 21. Delloye-Bourgeois, C. ∙ Jacquier, A. ∙ Charoy, C. ...

Seiradake, E. ∙ Jones, E.Y. ∙ Klein, R. Structural Perspectives on Axon Guidance Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 32 :577-608 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), and further experimental work is needed to establish whether such receptor complexes can form silencing super-complexes. 2) Future work is needed to investigate how the NEO1-NET1-RGM complex is modulated in the cell membrane. It is possible that the complex may exist in an equilibrium that is dependent on the local concentrations of NET1 and RGM or that the complex is endocytosed. Alternatively, complex formation may induce NEO1 cleavage to terminate signaling (e.g., van Erp et al., 2015 101. van Erp, S. ∙ van den Heuvel, D.M.A. ∙ Fujita, Y. ... Lrig2 Negatively Regulates Ectodomain Shedding of Axon Guidance Receptors by ADAM Proteases Dev. Cell. 2015; 35 :537-552 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) or affect localization into lipid rafts ( Shabanzadeh et al., 2015 92. Shabanzadeh, A.P. ∙ Tassew, N.G. ∙ Szydlowska, K. ... Uncoupling Neogenin association with lipid rafts promotes neuronal survival and functional recovery after stroke Cell Death Dis. 2015; 6 :e1744 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In vivo proteomic approaches performed in this study to identify NEO1-interacting proteins detected previously uncharacterized partners, including those involved in synapse formation and function ( Figure S8 ; Table S3 ). Therefore, another future model to explore is that termination of NEO1-NET1-RGMA signaling in, e.g., axon guidance, may allow activation of subsequent cellular processes such as synapse formation. There is likely also regulation at the level of the individual components of the super-complex. For example, RGMB can be phosphorylated by the extracellular kinase VLK ( Harada et al., 2019 36. Harada, H. ∙ Farhani, N. ∙ Wang, X.F. ... Extracellular phosphorylation drives the formation of neuronal circuitry Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15 :1035-1042 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RGMB tyrosine side chain that is phosphorylated by VLK (human Y268) is located opposite the RGMB-NEO1 interface, in a RGMB region that is in proximity to NET1 ( Figures S9 A and S9B). This suggests that RGMB phosphorylation by VLK may impact on the formation of the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGMB complex. RGMs can also be released into the extracellular matrix via cleavage of their GPI anchor ( Zhang et al., 2007 115. Zhang, A.S. ∙ Anderson, S.A. ∙ Meyers, K.R. ... Evidence that inhibition of hemojuvelin shedding in response to iron is mediated through neogenin J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :12547-12556 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as by SKI-1 and Furin proteases resulting in several different RGM fragments ( Tassew et al., 2012 97. Tassew, N.G. ∙ Charish, J. ∙ Seidah, N.G. ... SKI-1 and Furin generate multiple RGMa fragments that regulate axonal growth Dev. Cell. 2012; 22 :391-402 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, RGMs exhibit a plastic role, with context-dependent RGM fragments capable of signaling in “ trans” to control NEO1 receptor architectures and downstream signaling.

(B) The ternary complex containing full-length RGMB harbors three distinct binding sites for the disulfide linked BMP dimer (green) (here shown for BMP2). (C) Further addition of the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex and the dimeric BMP2 morphogen can lead to clustering and a continuous arrangement in with RGMB bridges the dimer of BMP2 and the ternary complex. Asterisks mark the “free” RGMB-binding sites on BMP2. (D, E) The RGMB VLK phosphorylation site mapped onto the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex structure. (D) Ribbon representation of the NEO1-NET1-RGMB protomer structure (color coded as in Figure 1 ).

RGMB-Y268 is facing the inside of the ternary complex, and is likely shielded for VLK access. 3) Additional components may participate or interact with the NEO1-NET1-RGM super-complex. For example, in addition to acting as NEO1 ligands, RGMs are crucial co-receptors in the BMP pathway. This is primarily mediated via the interaction of the N-terminal domain of RGM (N-RGM, Figure 1 A) with BMP ligands ( Healey et al., 2015 38. Healey, E.G. ∙ Bishop, B. ∙ Elegheert, J. ...

Neogenin interacts with hemojuvelin through its two membrane-proximal fibronectin type III domains Biochemistry. 2008; 47 :4237-4245 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). For BMP co-receptor function, RGMs are required to signal in “ cis ,” expressed by the same cell as NEO1 (and the BMP receptors). We previously showed that in this scenario RGM can simultaneously bind to BMP ligands and NEO1 ( Healey et al., 2015 38. Healey, E.G. ∙ Bishop, B. ∙ Elegheert, J. ... Repulsive guidance molecule is a structural bridge between neogenin and bone morphogenetic protein Nat. Struct. Mol.

Repulsive guidance molecules lock growth differentiation factor 5 in an inhibitory complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :15620-15631 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). This arrangement leads to BMP-dependent clustering of NEO1 at the cell surface, with RGM acting as a physical bridge. The presence of BMP ligands alongside NEO1, NET1, and RGM could facilitate clustering of the ternary 3:3:3 NEO1-NET1-RGM complex ( Figures S9 C–S9E). Another level of regulation could be achieved by direct protein-protein interactions mediated by the cell surface receptors LRIG ( van Erp et al., 2015 101. van Erp, S. ∙ van den Heuvel, D.M.A. ∙ Fujita, Y. ...

All cell lines used in this study are listed in the Key Resources Table and were cultured under standard growth conditions (37 °C, 5% CO 2 ). HEK293T were used for transient mammalian expression using pHLsec vector ( Aricescu et al., 2006 7. Aricescu, A.R. ∙ Lu, W. ∙ Jones, E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :1243-1250 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ). HEK293T Lenti-X cells were utilised to generate lentiviruses with the pHR-CMV-TetO 2 vector ( Elegheert et al., 2018 24. Elegheert, J. ∙ Behiels, E. ∙ Bishop, B. ... Lentiviral transduction of mammalian cells for fast, scalable and high-level production of soluble and membrane proteins Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :2991-3017 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were subsequently used to infect HEK293T cells and produce stable cell lines. Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM high glucose, Sigma) supplemented with L-glutamine, non-essential amino-acids (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies) with no addition of antibiotics. Cells were grown and maintained in standard T75 (75 cm 2 - LentiX) or T175 (175 cm 2 - HEK293T) flasks. Cos-7 cells were used for PLA, immunofluorescence staining experiments (transfected with pHLsec vectors) and the AP binding assay (transfected with pCMVXL-6 and pcDNA3.1 vectors). Cos-7 cells were grown in complete medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, L-Glutamine and MEM non-essential amino acids. For the PLA and immunofluorescence staining experiments, Cos-7 cells were incubated with purified NET1 and RGMB in complete medium. We used E. coli DH5α competent cells for cloning and E. coli BL21-DE3 for expression of 3C protease.
Subventricular zone neurospheres (SVZ-NSC) were cultured in vitro from C57BL/6 and Dcc fl/fl -Emx1-IRES-cre mice. These were used for migration-, differentiation-, and proliferation assays. Isolation SVZ-NSCs was performed as described previously ( Guo et al., 2012 34. Guo, W. ∙ Patzlaff, N.E. ∙ Jobe, E.M. ... Isolation of multipotent neural stem or progenitor cells from both the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone of a single adult mouse Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :2005-2012 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). All SVZ-NSCs were cultured under standard growth conditions (37 °C, 5% CO 2 ) in T25 flasks, in glutaMAX DMEM/F-12 (Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF (Thermo-Fisher), 20 ng/ml FGF (Thermo-Fisher), B-27 (Thermo-Fisher) and penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo-Fisher). To induce differentiation SVZ-NSCs were cultured in neural differentiation medium consisting of Neurobasal medium (Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with 200 mM L-glutamine (Thermo-Fisher), 1x pen/strep, B-27 supplement (Thermo-Fisher) and 1.8 mM HEPES (Thermo-Fisher). For the growth cone collapse assays cortical neurons were cultured using trypsin-dissociated P0 mouse cortex from C57BL/6 and Dcc fl/fl -Emx1-IRES-cre mice. Neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium (NB; Thermo-Fisher) containing 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA), 1x penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep, Thermo-Fisher), and B-27 supplement (Thermo-Fisher) on 100 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 40 μg/ml laminin (Thermo-Fisher) coated, acid-washed coverslips in 12-wells plates under standard growth conditions (37 °C, 5% CO 2 ).
All mice were housed at 21 ± 2 °C and 40% - 70% humidity, on a wood-chip bedding supplemented with tissue on a 12h/12h day/night cycle with lights off at 19 hr. Animals were fed ad libitum . All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Utrecht University (Dierexperimenten Ethische Commissie) (CCD license: AVD115002016532) and conducted in agreement with Dutch laws (Wet op de Dierproeven, 1996; revised 2014) and European regulations (Guideline 86/609/EEC; Directive 2010/63/EU). Pregnant mothers were housed individually from the moment of observation of the plug (E0.5). In all experiments gender was not considered. C57BL/6j (Charles river) mice were used for in utero electroporation, brain lysate analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. To delete DCC from the cortex and subventricular zone, Emx1-IRES-cre mice (The Jackson Laboratory, JAX stock #005628) were crossed with Dcc fl/fl mice ( Krimpenfort et al., 2012 50. Krimpenfort, P. ∙ Song, J.Y. ∙ Proost, N. ... Deleted in colorectal carcinoma suppresses metastasis in p53-deficient mammary tumours Nature. 2012; 482 :538-541 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) (a gift from Anton Berns). Syn-GFP-NEO1 mice were generated by pronuclear injections executed in the Central Laboratory Animal Facility (GDL, Utrecht University). Before injection, a 10.1 Kb DNA fragment containing the Syn-GFP-NEO1 cassette was PmeI-cut from the pcDNA3.1-Syn-GFP-NEO1 vector and isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and electro-elution, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was injected into male pronuclei of fertilized eggs isolated from super-ovulated B6CBAF1/Jico mice (Charles River). Superovulation was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 5IU pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin (PMSG; Folligonan), followed by injection of 5IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG; Chorulon) 42-48 hrs later. Super-ovulated females were immediately mated with appropriate stud males. Microinjections were performed with a Narishige IM-300 microinjector. After injection of DNA into the pronucleus, embryos were cultured overnight in M2 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. The next day, 2-cell stage embryos were implanted into Crl:CD-1(ICR) (Charles River) foster mothers. 15-20 Embryos were transferred into one oviduct of each recipient mouse. Transgenic founders were selected by PCR genotyping, using the following primers; FW, 5’- TTAGACCTTGGTCCCACCATGTTCAAGATCCTGCTG -3’; and RV, 5’- TCGACCGGTCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGATATC -3’, and backcrossed with C57BL/6 (Charles River) females to generate stable transgenic mouse lines.

A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :1243-1250 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, for SAXS, AUC and explant experiments, NET1 ΔNTR and NET1 FL constructs were cloned into the pHR-CMV-TetO 2 vector for lentiviral transduction and stable cell line generation, with an N-terminal His 6 -SUMO-3C tag ( Elegheert et al., 2018 24. Elegheert, J. ∙ Behiels, E. ∙ Bishop, B. ... Lentiviral transduction of mammalian cells for fast, scalable and high-level production of soluble and membrane proteins Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :2991-3017 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). This information is summarized in the ‘protein constructs, vectors and experimental uses’ portion of this section.
For large-scale expression, secreted constructs were expressed in HEK-293T cells. For transient transfection, cells were grown in roller bottles for 3 days at 37 o C, 5% CO 2 in DMEM (Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), 2mM L-Glutamine (Thermo-Fisher) and 0.1 mM NEAA (Thermo-Fisher) (’10% FBS/DMEM’) to confluency, transfected with 2 mg/L of pHLsec plasmid using PEI and exchanged into 2% FBS/DMEM. In the case of Lentivirally-transduced stable cell lines, HEK-293 LentiX cells were grown to confluency in 6-well dishes under conditions described above and co-transfected with 4 μg of DNA comprising pHR-CMV-TetO 2 plasmid, pMD2.G (envelope plasmid) and psPAX2 (packaging plasmid) in a 1:1:1 ratio using PEI ( Elegheert et al., 2018 24. Elegheert, J. ∙ Behiels, E. ∙ Bishop, B. ... Lentiviral transduction of mammalian cells for fast, scalable and high-level production of soluble and membrane proteins Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :2991-3017 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) and exchanged into 2% FBS. After 3 days, lentiviral particles were harvested from the supernatant, filtered (0.45 μm) and used to transduce confluent HEK-293T cells in a 6-well dish. Polybrene (Merck) was added at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL to promote virus:host fusion. Stable cell lines generated in this way were expanded to large-scale culture in roller bottles, grown to confluency in 10% FBS (3 days, 37 ºC, 5% CO 2 ) and subsequently exchanged into 2% media.
All expression was performed in the presence of kifunensine (1 mg/L), a class I α-mannosidase inhibitor ( Chang et al., 2007 15. Chang, V.T. ∙ Crispin, M. ∙ Aricescu, A.R. ... Glycoprotein structural genomics: solving the glycosylation problem Structure. 2007; 15 :267-273 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2011 117. Zhao, Y. ∙ Bishop, B. ∙ Clay, J.E. ... Automation of large scale transient protein expression in mammalian cells J. Struct. Biol. 2011; 175 :209-215 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), added during exchange of cell into low serum. Cells were maintained at 37 ºC throughout (besides all NET1 FL constructs, which were expressed at 30 ºC following exchange into 2% FBS/DMEM). Conditioned media was collected five days post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation and filtered (0.22 μm).
For His 6 -tagged proteins (both C-His 6 , N-His 6 -SUMO-3C and N-FLAG/C-His 6 ), conditioned media was dialyzed against 10 volumes of PBS (48h, 4 °C) and proteins were purified by cobalt-affinity chromatography with TALON beads (Clontech). In order to produce RGMB core , we engineered a human rhinovirus 3C cleavage site between amino acid residues 334 and 335 ( Bell et al., 2013 10. Bell, C.H. ∙ Healey, E. ∙ van Erp, S. ... Structure of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM)-neogenin signaling hub Science. 2013; 341 :77-80 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). RGMB CORE and N-His 6 -SUMO-3C-NET1 constructs were first purified as the other His 6 -tagged proteins, cleaved with 3C protease (His 6 tagged; 12h, 21°C) and subjected to a second Talon bead purification from which the flow through (unbound fraction) was collected.
1D4-tagged NET1 ΔNTR was purified directly from conditioned media incubated with purified Rho-1D4 antibody (University of British Columbia) coupled to CNBr-activated sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Protein-bound beads were washed extensively with 50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 300 mM NaCl and eluted overnight in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 500 μM “TETSQVAPA” peptide (Genscript).
All affinity-purified protein samples were subject to a final purification step via size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Superdex S200 16/60 column, GE Healthcare) in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 150 mM (1 M for NET1 ΔNTR ) NaCl. N-FLAG/C-His 6 RGMB ECD constructs purified for cis PLA assays were purified in PBS, 10% glycerol.
NEO1 FN456 was transiently expressed from pHLsec with a C-His 6 tag for crystallization, SPR (as analyte), AUC and SAXS experiments. NEO1 FN56 , eNEO1, DCC FN456 and DCC FN56 were transiently expressed from pHLsec with C-His 6 tags for use in SPR experiments (as analytes). NEO1 FL and DCC FL were transiently expressed from pHLsec with N-FLAG tags for cell surface staining experiments.
NET1 ΔNTR was transiently expressed from pHLsec with a C-1D4 tag for crystallization experiments. NET1 ΔNTR was also transiently expressed from pHLsec with an N-His 6 -SUMO-3C for SAXS experiments and growth cone collapse assays.

Site-directed mutagenesis and protein engineering were carried out using a two-step overlap-extension PCR strategy ( Heckman and Pease, 2007 39. Heckman, K.L. ∙ Pease, L.R. Gene splicing and mutagenesis by PCR-driven overlap extension Nat.

Both the binary NEO1 FN456 :NET1 ΔNTR and ternary NEO1 FN456 :NET1 ΔNTR :RGMB CORE complexes were formed by mixing purified single components in equimolar amounts, dialyzed against 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl (24h, 4 °C) and purified via SEC (Superdex 200 16/60, GE Healthcare) with a running buffer of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions containing the respective complex were supplemented with NDSB-256 (Hampton research) to a final concentration of 0.2 M and concentrated to 7 mg/ml.

Structures were refined using initial rounds of refinement in REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al., 2011 72. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

BUSTER Global Phasing Ltd, 2011 Google Scholar ). This was interspersed with rounds of manual model building in COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 25. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (21028) PubMed Google Scholar ). Refinement statistics are presented in Table S1 and Methods S1 .
Stereochemical properties were assessed using MolProbity ( Davis et al., 2007 19. Davis, I.W. ∙ Leaver-Fay, A. ∙ Chen, V.B. ... MolProbity: all-atom contacts and structure validation for proteins and nucleic acids Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 W375-83 Crossref Scopus (2833) Google Scholar ) and are presented in Table S1 .

The ternary NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR -RGMB ECD complex was purified by SEC on a S200 10/300 Increase column with a running buffer of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM SOS, 0.01% NaN 3 at 4 °C ( Figure S2 ). The peak fraction containing the ternary complex was diluted to 0.07 mg/ml in SEC buffer. Lacey carbon grids with 3nm ultrathin carbon support film were glow discharged for 30 seconds at high RF level using Harrick Plasma Cleaner, model PDC-002-CE, and then 3.5 μl of the sample was pipetted per grid. Excess protein was blotted away for 3 seconds using filter paper (round filter paper for Vitrobot from Agar Scientific, catalogue number 47000-100) and Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (relative force -15) at 95–100% humidity. Grids were plunge frozen in liquid ethane.
Cryo-EM data were collected on a Titan Krios G3i microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300kV with a 50μm C2 aperture and Volta phase plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), at the Division of Structural Biology, University of Oxford. Movies were recorded using a FEI Falcon III direct electron detector in electron counting mode using EPU software at a nominal magnification of 96000x, corresponding to a physical pixel size of 0.85 Å/pixel. A total dose of 40 e – /Å 2 was used at a dose rate of 0.77 e – /pix/sec. Detailed acquisition parameters are listed in supplemental information ( Table S2 ).
In total 1635 movies were collected and drift correction, beam-induced motion and dose-weighting were performed with MotionCor2 RELION 3.1 ( Zivanov et al., 2018 119. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (1065) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 1635 movies. Contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated using CTFFIND 4.1 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 87. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (1253) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in RELION. 280158 particles were picked using Warp ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 99. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2D classification in cryoSPARC v2 ( Punjani et al., 2017 82. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (1033) PubMed Google Scholar ) were performed for these particles and best 2D class averaged with 100674 particles were used to generate ab-initio 3D model with C3 symmetry. C1 symmetry did not generate reasonable 3D model. All Warp picked particles were used for 3D classification in cryoSPARC v2 and the best class with 177056 particles was used for refinement in RELION 3.1 with initial model generated in cryoSPARC v2. Bayesian particle polishing improved the resolution to 5.44 Å, however the map for RGMB was very weak. Last step of 3D classification without alignment with T regularization parameter set to 16 was performed and gave one class with more continuous map for RGMB, which was refined to 5.98 Å resolution, as estimated using the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion.
The crystal structure of the ternary NEO1-NET1-RGMB (3:3:3) complex was placed into 5.98 Å map manually and was initially fitted as 3 rigid bodies using UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2007 31. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Ferrin, T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 :281-287 Crossref Scopus (519) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each rigid body comprised the C-terminal domain of RGMB in complex with the FN domains 5–6 of NEO1 plus NET1 in complex with the FN domain 4 of NEO1. These 3 rigid bodies could be readily refined in real space using PHENIX 1.18.2-3874 ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ) (MolProbity all-atom clash score 2.41; model-to-map fit, CC_mask 0.48 ( Davis et al., 2007 19. Davis, I.W. ∙ Leaver-Fay, A. ∙ Chen, V.B. ... MolProbity: all-atom contacts and structure validation for proteins and nucleic acids Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 W375-83 Crossref Scopus (2833) Google Scholar )). We further refined the ternary NET1–NEO1–RGMB (3:3:3) complex by splitting it into 6 rigid bodies. 3 rigid bodies out of 6 comprised the C-terminal domain of RGMB in complex with the FN domains 5–6 of NEO1 plus the LE domains 2–3 on NET1. The remaining 3 rigid bodies out of 6 comprised the LE 1-LN domains of NET1 plus the FN domain 4 of NEO1. The refinement of 6 rigid bodies in real space using PHENIX gave better model-to-map fit without introducing any clashes and is presented in this study (MolProbity all-atom clash score 2.22; model-to-map fit, CC_mask 0.55). Linkers between NEO1 FNs 4 and 5–6, and NET1 LNs 1 and 2–3 were manually rebuilt in COOT. A full description of the cryo-EM data collection and structure refinement parameters is presented in Table S2 and the work flow is illustrated in Methods S2.
cDNA inserts for desired SPR ligands were cloned into the pHLsec-Avitag3 vector ( Aricescu et al., 2006 7. Aricescu, A.R. ∙ Lu, W. ∙ Jones, E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :1243-1250 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to the production of proteins carrying a C-terminal biotin ligase (BirA) recognition site (‘Avi-tag’). Constructs were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells in a 6-well dish with pDisplay-BirA-ER (Addgene plasmid 20856; codes for an ER-localized biotin ligase) in a 3:1 pHLsec:pDisplay ratio. Cells were supplemented with 100 μM D-biotin to facilitate Avi-tag biotinylation, and maintained at 37 o C, 5% CO 2 for 3 days. Conditioned medium was collected and dialyzed against 2000 volumes of PBS. SPR experiments were carried out using a Biacore T200 machine (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C in SPR running buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) polysorbate-20 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma)). Streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich) was covalently coupled to CM5 sensory chips via amine coupling to a response unit (RU) level of 5000 RU ( Johnson et al., 2009 42. Johnson, T. ∙ Ouhtit, A. ∙ Gaur, R. ...

Biochem. 1999; 266 :9-15 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), to which biotinylated ligands were captured to the desired RU level. For each experiment, two analyte binding cycles were performed with buffer injections between each, enabling double referencing of binding responses ( Myszka, 1999 73. Myszka, D.G. Improving biosensor analysis J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12 :279-284 Crossref Scopus (621) PubMed Google Scholar ).
NET1 ΔNTR and NET1 FL were immobilized at a level of 900 RU each. Purified NEO1 constructs (eNEO1, NEO1 FN456 ) were purified by SEC as described above, and the highest concentration of analyte prepared via mixing 1:1 with a two-fold concentrated stock of SPR running buffer. Injection of 9 samples, prepared by a two-fold dilution series in running buffer from a highest concentration of 8 μM, was performed according to a series of: buffer blank, lowest-to-highest, highest-to-lowest, buffer blank. eNEO1 was injected for 400 s and NEO1 FN456 for 360 s at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, followed by a 60 s dissociation phase. Surfaces were regenerated using 3 M MgCl 2 , injected for 120 s. Experimental data were processed using program SCRUBBER2 (Biological). Non-linear regression curve fitting was used to fit data to a ‘one-site specific binding’ model (Y = B max × X /(K d + X); X, analyte concentration; B max , maximum analyte binding) using GraphPad Prism 7 ( www.graphpad.com ).
NET1 ΔNTR wild type, ‘Interface-1’ mutant and ‘Interface-2’ mutant were immobilized at a level of 1007, 1027 and 937 RU each. NEO1 FN456, NEO1 FN56 , DCC FN456 and NEO1 FN56 were purified by SEC and buffer exchanged into SPR running buffer as detailed above.

NET1 ΔNTR was immobilized at a level of 900 RU. RGMB ECD and RGMA ECD were purified by SEC and buffer exchanged into SPR running buffer as detailed above. Injection of 12 samples, prepared by a two-fold dilution series in running buffer from a highest concentration of 40 μM (RGMB ECD ) or 25 μM (RGMA ECD ), was performed according to a series of: buffer blank, lowest-to-highest, highest-to-lowest, buffer blank. RGM ECD analytes were injected for 110 s at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, followed by a dissociation phase of 60 s. Surfaces were regenerated using 3 M MgCl 2 , injected for 120 s.

Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were performed at 20 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments), utilising a scanning absorbance of 280 nm and interference optics. Samples were contained within 12 mm Epon sector-shaped two-channel centerpieces and spun at 400,000 rpm (An60Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter Inc., CA), with 100 sample distribution scans taken in 6 minute intervals, alongside interference optics. Absorbance data for scans were analyzed using the program SedFit ( Brown and Schuck, 2006 14. Brown, P.H. ∙ Schuck, P. Macromolecular size-and-shape distributions by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation Biophys. J. 2006; 90 :4651-4661 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ) for size-and-shape distributions [c( s,fr ), where fr is the frictional ratio and for a sphere fr = 1 and for other species fr > 1]( Brown and Schuck, 2006 14. Brown, P.H. ∙ Schuck, P. Macromolecular size-and-shape distributions by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation Biophys. J. 2006; 90 :4651-4661 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ). This enables the plotting of contour plots of c(s,M), where M is the weight of the protein. In all cases, a partial specific volume value of 0.73 ml g -1 was used.
For SV-AUC experiments, binary NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR and ternary NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR -RGMB ECD complexes were assembled via mixing of components in equimolar ratios, using wild type NET1 ΔNTR or NET1 FL , and ‘Interface-1’ and ‘Interface-2’ mutants. Complexes were then dialyzed for 16 hours against a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , and the concentration was subsequently adjusted to 3 mg/ml via dilution with dialysis buffer.
SAXS experiments were performed at beamline B21, Diamond Light Source, UK, at 298K, over a momentum transfer (q) range of 0.01 Å -1 < q < 0.45 Å -1 , where q = 4π sin(θ)/λ, and 2θ is the scattering angle. Samples were injected onto an inline Shodex KW-404 size exclusion column in a running buffer of 10 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM KNO 3 . Data were collected using a Pilatus 2M detector with a sample-to-detector distance of 4014 mm and a beam energy of 12.4 keV. Protein samples were injected at the following concentrations: NET1 ΔNTR : 4.0 mg/ml; RGMB ECD : 4.0 mg/ml; NEO1 FN456 : 4.0 mg/ml; NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR : 2.4 and 5.9 mg/ml; NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR -RGMB ECD : 3.3, 4.0 and 6.0 mg/ml.
Data processing and reduction, alongside calculation of molecular weights from the volume of correlation metric (Vc), was performed using the program Scatter ( Rambo and Tainer, 2013 84. Rambo, R.P. ∙ Tainer, J.A. Accurate assessment of mass, models and resolution by small-angle scattering Nature. 2013; 496 :477-481 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individual SEC-SAXS frames were loaded into Scatter and protein/buffer regions were selected according to visual inspection of the per-frame scattering intensity plot. Individual frames containing protein were buffer-subtracted, followed by analysis of R g (radius of gyration) values across the peak region of eluted protein complex. In each case, a subset of frames showing a constant R g (+/-1 Å) was selected for further analysis. These frames were scaled against one another and individual Log 10 intensity plots were inspected to inform removal of any outlier frames. Finally, matching frames were merged together to generate a final data file for further analysis. The reported R g and error values were calculated using PRIMUS ( Konarev et al., 2003 48. Konarev, P.V. ∙ Volkov, V.V. ∙ Sokolova, A.V. ... PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis J. Appl. Cryst. 2003; 36 :1277-1282 Crossref Scopus (2144) Google Scholar ). Mass determination of the NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR -RGMB ECD complex was based on the scattering data from the highest concentration sample (6.0 mg/ml). At the lower concentrations, ternary complex disassembly led to contamination of the overall dataset by non-3:3:3 complexes.
For modelling of the NET1 ΔNTR solution structure, missing residues were first added to the crystal structure using Modeller ( Eswar et al., 2003 26. Eswar, N. ∙ John, B. ∙ Mirkovic, N. ... Tools for comparative protein structure modeling and analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :3375-3380 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, 50 independent all-atom ensembles of 100 models were generated using Allosmod ( Weinkam et al., 2012 104. Weinkam, P. ∙ Pons, J. ∙ Sali, A. Structure-based model of allostery predicts coupling between distant sites Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :4875-4880 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) and calculation and fitting of theoretical scattering curves was performed using FoXS ( Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2016 89.

FoXS, FoXSDock and MultiFoXS: Single-state and multi-state structural modeling of proteins and their complexes based on SAXS profiles Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 W424-9 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). This entire procedure was automated via the use of Allosmod-FoXS ( Guttman et al., 2013 35. Guttman, M. ∙ Weinkam, P. ∙ Sali, A. ... All-atom ensemble modeling to analyze small-angle x-ray scattering of glycosylated proteins Structure. 2013; 21 :321-331 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). The best-scoring model was used as input for MultiFoXS ( Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2016 89. Schneidman-Duhovny, D. ∙ Hammel, M. ∙ Tainer, J.A. ... FoXS, FoXSDock and MultiFoXS: Single-state and multi-state structural modeling of proteins and their complexes based on SAXS profiles Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 W424-9 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ) to model flexibility at inter-domain hinge points. This process produced 10000 conformations, followed by scoring of multi-state models fit to experimental scattering data as described above using FoXS.
SEC-MALS experiments were performed using a Wyatt Dawn HELEOS-II 8-angle light scattering detector (with 663.8 nm laser) and a Wyatt Optilab rEX refractive index monitor linked to a Shimadzu HPLC system comprising LC-20AD pump, SIL-20A autosampler and SPD20A UV/Vis detector. SEC-MALS of the NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR -RGMA ECD complex (1.8 mg ml -1 , 100 μl) was performed using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column equilibrated in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM sucrose octasulfate, 0.02% NaN 3 , 0.5 ml min -1 flow rate at 21 °C. SEC-MALS of the NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR -RGMB ECD complex (1.0 mg ml -1 , 100 μl) was performed using a Superdex 200 10/30 column equilibrated in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM sucrose octasulfate, 0.01% NaN 3 , 0.5 ml min -1 flow rate at 21 °C. Scattering data were analyzed and molecular weight was calculated using ASTRA 6 software (Wyatt). Glycosylation of the NEO1 FN456 -NET1 ΔNTR -RGM ECD complexes was taken into account during calculation of dn/dc value. RGMA-containing ternary complex with 8 Asn-linked glycosylation sites: dn/dc = 0.1810 ml/g; RGMB-containing ternary complex with 7 Asn-linked glycosylation sites: dn/dc = 0.1814 ml/g. dn/dc values for proteins (0.1850 ml/g) and glycans (0.146 ml/g) were taken from ( Arakawa and Wen, 2001 6. Arakawa, T. ∙ Wen, J. Determination of carbohydrate contents from excess light scattering Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299 :158-161 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). To calculate the total molecular mass of glycoprotein complexes, it was assumed that each Asn-linked glycosylation site was attached to a Man 9 GlcNAc 2 moiety with a mass of 1883 Da.
COS-7 cells were transfected with the corresponding plasmids and Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were then re-plated and grown on coverslips for 48h, before they were incubated with fresh medium only as a negative control or with fresh medium containing purified Netrin and purified RGMB where applicable for 2 hours at 37°C. Subsequently, the medium was removed, cells were gently washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min.
Immunofluorescence staining was performed by blocking the fixed cells with 10% FBS in PBS for 1 hr. All antibodies were diluted in 0.1% FBS in PBS and washes were carried out with PBS. After blocking, cells were incubated with anti-Flag (1:500) and anti-Rho ID4 (1:1000). Following incubation with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 555 (1:1000) the coverslips were mounted onto a microscope slide with Vectashield containing DAPI.
PLA assays were carried out solely with reagents included in the Duolink in situ red starter kit apart from both antibodies and mounting medium. This technology enables the detection of specific protein-protein interactions in fixed cells. Detection is based on the recognition of both protein partners with specific antibodies that are being covalently linked to DNA primers. If the proteins of interest are in close proximity (< 40nm), the DNA oligos hybridize and give rise to circular DNA. A rolling-circle amplification (RCA) step with fluorescent probes generates highly enhanced fluorescent foci of sites of protein-protein interaction that can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy ( Alam, 2018 5. Alam, M.S. Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2018; 123 :e58 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Incubations were performed in a humidity chamber. In essence, fixed cells were blocked with blocking solution for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated with anti-Flag (1:1000) and anti-Rho ID4 (1:1000) in antibody diluent for 1hr at room temperature, followed by three wash steps with buffer A. The minus and plus DNA probes were diluted in antibody diluent, added to the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After three wash steps with buffer A, 5x ligase buffer was diluted in water and complemented with ligase, added to cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. This was followed by three wash steps with buffer A. 5x amplification buffer was diluted in water and complemented with polymerase. This was added to the cells and incubation was at 37 °C for 90 min. Cells were washed two times with 1x and one time with 0.01x buffer B. Finally, the cover slips were mounted on microscope slides using Vectashield containing DAPI. Images were taken with a Leica DMi8 TIRF Microscope and a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 V2 camera.
For the construction of the pcDNA3.1-Syn-GFP-NEO1 vector, the NEO1 coding sequence without signal peptide (aa 46-1492) was PCR-amplified from wild type mouse NEO1 (pCMVXL-6-NEO1; a kind gift of Denise Davis). This fragment was cloned into the blunt-made MluI/NotI sites of the PCI-Syn-GlyS267Q plasmid, containing the rat synapsin I promoter (a kind gift of Manfred Kiliman ( Hoesche et al., 1993 40. Hoesche, C. ∙ Sauerwald, A. ∙ Veh, R.W. ... The 5¢-flanking region of the rat synapsin I gene directs neuron-specific and developmentally regulated reporter gene expression in transgenic mice J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 :26494-26502 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) Syn-NEO1 fragment was released from the PCI vector backbone by ClaI restriction and ligated into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3.1 ( pcDNA3.1(-)/myc-his ; Invitrogen). A signal peptide, GFP and 3xFLAG tag were PCR-amplified from the pRK5-DR/GABA(A)a1 vector (a kind gift of Guus Smit) and ligated N-terminal of the NEO1 coding sequence into the newly generated restriction sites AgeI and PshAI. For construction of the pcDNA3.1-CMV-GFP-NEO1 vector, the GFP-NEO1 fragment was isolated from the pcDNA3.1-Syn-GFP-NEO1 vector using ClaI and PshA restriction. The restriction sites were made blunt-ended and the GFP-NEO1 fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3.1 ( pcDNA3.1(-)/myc-his ; Invitrogen).
COS-7 and HEK293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza, BioWhittaker), 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA) and 1x penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep; PAA), in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. COS-7 cells and HEK293 cells were transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences) ( Reed et al., 2006 85. Reed, S.E. ∙ Staley, E.M. ∙ Mayginnes, J.P. ... Transfection of mammalian cells using linear polyethylenimine is a simple and effective means of producing recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors J. Virol. Methods. 2006; 138 :85-98 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mouse postnatal day 0 (P0) cerebral cortices were dissected and dissociated in 0.25% trypsin (PAA Laboratories) in DMEM/F12 (Thermo-Fisher) at 37 °C for 15 min. Trypsin was inactivated by adding an equal volume of DMEM/F12 containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo-Fisher). The tissue was further dissociated by trituration in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and 20 μg/ml DNase I (Roche). Dissociated cortical neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium (NB; Thermo-Fisher) containing 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA), 1x penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep, Thermo-Fisher), and B-27 supplement (Thermo-Fisher) on 100 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 40 μg/ml laminin (Thermo-Fisher) coated, acid-washed coverslips in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. At DIV3, cortical neurons were treated for 30 min with control medium or with medium containing 2 μg/ml mouse RGMA (R&D systems) with or without 3.2 μg/ml NET1 ΔNTR -WT, or NET1 ΔNTR , ‘Interface-1’ and ‘Interface-2’ mutants, respectively. To test the effect of DCC deletion on RGMA-induced growth cone collapse, cortical neurons were treated for 30 min with control medium or with medium containing 2 μg/ml mouse RGMA (R&D systems) with or without 3.2 μg/ml NET1 (R&D Systems) at DIV3. In order to test whether RGMB induces growth cone collapse, cortical neurons were treated with 2 μg/ml mouse RGMB (R&D systems). Neurons were then fixed with 4% PFA and 15% sucrose for 20 min at RT and washed with PBS. To visualize neurons and growth cones, immunostaining was performed with anti-TuJ1 (1:1000, BioLegend) and with Alexa-568-tagged phalloidin (1:500, Thermo-Fisher). Immunocytochemistry for DCC and NEO1 were performed with goat anti-Neogenin (1:200, AF1079; R&D systems) and goat anti-DCC (1:500, sc-6535, Santa Cruz) primary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey-anti-goat (1:750, Life Technologies) secondary antibody. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope. Growth cone collapse was quantified for more than 100 neurons per condition, for three to six independent experiments. The criterion for the collapsed growth cones was loss of lamellipodia and the presence of only two or fewer filopodia. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 7 using one-way ANOVA (or two-way ANOVA for Emx1-Cre;DCC-flox experiment) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test.
Isolation and culture of mouse subventricular zone neurospheres (SVZ-NSCs) was performed as described previously ( Guo et al., 2012 34. Guo, W. ∙ Patzlaff, N.E. ∙ Jobe, E.M. ... Isolation of multipotent neural stem or progenitor cells from both the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone of a single adult mouse Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :2005-2012 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Either wild type C57BL/6j animals or Emx1-cre;DCC-flox mice (mutants and control littermates) were used. The cultures were maintained in glutaMAX DMEM/F-12 (Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF (Thermo-Fisher), 20 ng/ml FGF (Thermo-Fisher), B-27 (Thermo-Fisher) and penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo-Fisher) and kept in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37 °C. For the migration assay, coverslips were coated with 100 μg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and subsequently with 600 ng/ml protein diluted in glutaMAX DMEM/F-12 (Thermo-Fisher) for 2 hours at 37 o C. Tested proteins were: negative control (vehicle only), NET1 ΔNTR -WT, NET1 FL -WT, NET1 FL ‘Interface-1’ mutant and NET1 FL ‘Interface-2’ mutant. Diluted protein was discarded and differentiation media containing Neurobasal medium (Thermo-Fisher), 200 mM L-glutamine (Thermo-Fisher), 1x pen/strep, B-27 supplement (Thermo-Fisher) and 1.8 mM HEPES (Thermo-Fisher) was added. SVZ NSCs larger than 120 μm were plated on coated coverslips and incubated for 5 days. To test the effect of RGMA and RGMB, coverslips were coated with 600 ng/ml NET1 FL as described. Subsequently, mouse RGMA or RGMB was added to the differentiation media. RGMA was tested at two different concentrations: 1.2 μg/ml (2x RGMA) and 6.0 μg/ml (10x RGMA). For RGMB one concentration was tested: 1.2 μg/ml (2x RGMB). Then, cultures were fixed using 4% PFA and 30% sucrose for 15 min, washed with PBS and blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Merck) at room temperature. Primary antibodies used for immunostaining were mouse-anti-Tuj1 (1:500, Biolegend) and guinea pig-anti-DCX (1:200, Roche). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 donkey-anti-mouse (1:750, Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-guinea pig (1:750, Life Technologies). Cells were counterstained with DAPI. Additional immunocytochemistry for DCC and NEO1 was performed with the following primary antibodies: goat anti-Neogenin (1:200, AF1079; R&D systems) and goat anti-DCC (1:500, sc-6535, Santa Cruz), and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey-anti-goat (1:750, Life Technologies) as a secondary antibody. Images were acquired on the Axioscope 2 (Zeiss) and analyzed using ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 88. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (26382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells that were outside the neurosphere and positive for TUJ1 and the neuronal migration marker doublecortin (DCX) were considered to be migrating neurons. Each experimental group contained 9 to 18 coverslips, and per coverslip between 4 and 6 SVZ NSCs were imaged. The number of migrating cells per neurosphere per condition was normalized to the vehicle (negative control). Bartlett’s test was used to test for a significant difference between the standard deviations. When the input data did not meet the criteria for Bartlett’s test, the Brown-Forsythe test was performed to test for a significant difference between the standard deviations. For normally distributed data, one-way ANOVA (or two-way ANOVA for Emx1-Cre;DCC-flox experiment) and post hoc Tukey’s test were performed to test the difference between groups. For not normally distributed data Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test were performed. For the RGMB assay, a paired two-tailed t-test was performed. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism ( www.graphpad.com ). Migration distances of DCX/TUJ1+ cells were analyzed by measuring the distance between the nucleus and the edge of the neurosphere. For the RGMA/RGMB-related assays this was measured for all migrating neurons. For the assays concerning the NET1-ΔNTR and NET1-Interface1 and NET1-Interface2, the migration distance of a randomly selected subset of neurons was analyzed.
To test the effect of 1.2 μg/ml (2x RGMA) and 6.0 μg/ml (10x RGMA) RGMA on neurosphere differentiation, an EdU assay was performed. DIV2 SVZ NSCs were plated on 100 μg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated coverslips and were placed on differentiation medium (Neurobasal medium (Thermo-Fisher), 200 mM L-glutamine (Thermo-Fisher), 1x pen/strep, B-27 supplement (Thermo-Fisher) and 1.8 mM HEPES (Thermo-Fisher)) for one day. Then, EdU (ThermoFisher) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 10 μM. One day later, the EdU-containing medium was replaced with differentiation medium and cells were cultured for another 3 days. Cultures were fixed using 4% PFA and EdU was visualized using the Click-It EdU Cell proliferation kit for imaging (Alexa Fluor 555 dye; ThermoFisher), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Images were acquired on the Axioscope 2 (Zeiss) and analyzed using ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 88. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (26382) PubMed Google Scholar ). The single EdU and DAPI channels were first thresholded. Then EdU-positive and DAPI-positive cells were counted using the Analyze Particles function in ImageJ.
A neuronal proliferation assay was performed to test the effect of 1.2 μg/ml (2x RGMA) and 6.0 μg/ml (10x RGMA) RGMA on neuronal proliferation. The SVZ NSC migration assay was performed as described before except that now small DIV2 SVZ NSC neurospheres were used instead of neurospheres > 120 μm. Immunostaining for TUJ1 was performed as described before. Images were acquired on the Axioscope 2 (Zeiss) and analyzed using ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 88. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (26382) PubMed Google Scholar ). The single TUJ1 and DAPI channels were first thresholded. Then TUJ1-positive and DAPI-positive cells were counted using the Analyze Particles function in ImageJ. For both assays three biological replicates were performed (n = 3), each technical replicate contained 2 coverslips. To test the differences between conditions one-way ANOVA was performed in GraphPad Prism (version 9.0.0)
Raw single-cell expression data from ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) cells from 8-10 week old mice was downloaded (GSE109447) ( Mizrak et al., 2019 65. Mizrak, D. ∙ Levitin, H.M. ∙ Delgado, A.C. ... Single-Cell Analysis of Regional Differences in Adult V-SVZ Neural Stem Cell Lineages Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :394-406 e395 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data was processed using SCANPY version (1.4.6) ( Wolf et al., 2018 109. Wolf, A.F. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biology. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ). The dataset contained 13005 cells and 48529 genes. First, cells were normalized and log-transformed. Second, highly variable genes (HVGs) (minimal mean expression = 0.0125, maximal mean expression = 3, minimal dispersion = 0.5) were selected. Third, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed based on the HVGs. Fourth, a neighbourhood graph was computed using the first 40 PCAs. Based on this a UMAP embedding was computed. Original cluster-specific marker genes defined by the authors were used to label clusters. Next, we plotted Netrin-1 (NET1), RGMA, RGMB and Neogenin (NEO1) expression on the UMAP embedding.
Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was performed as described in ( Pasterkamp et al., 2007 80. Pasterkamp, R.J. ∙ Kolk, S.M. ∙ Hellemons, A.J. ... Expression patterns of semaphorin7A and plexinC1 during rat neural development suggest roles in axon guidance and neuronal migration BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7 :98 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). The probe for NET1 was generated by one step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from whole mouse brain RNA and following primers: 5’- CGACCTCAATAACCCGCACA -3’, 5’- CTTGCAACGGTCGCATTCAG -3’. The probe for NEO1 (NM_008684.2: 2087-2587) was generated by using sense primer 5’- ACACCGTTATCTGGCAATGG -3’ and antisense primer 5’- TTCAGCAGACAGCCAATCAG -3’. cDNA was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and transcribed with T7 polymerase for antisense and Sp6 polymerase for sense probes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled cRNA probe synthesis was performed by in vitro transcription. Embryonic brains were isolated, fixed ON in 4% PFA in PBS (pH 7.4), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. Brains were embedded in 7,5% gelatin and 10% sucrose solution in PBS and subsequently frozen in isopentane to be stored in -80 o C for long term use. 20 μm sections were cut on a cryostat, mounted on slides, dried for 2 hr and stored at -80 o C. Tissue sections were washed 3 x 5 minutes with 1x PBS + 0.1% Tween and subsequently permeabilized for 5 minutes with proteinase K (1:5000 in PBS) and were post-fixed with 4% PFA for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT). For background reduction, sections were acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine and 0.06% HCl for 10 minutes at room temperature. Prehybridization in hybridization mix (50% deionized formamide, 5x SSC, 5x Denhardts, 250 μg/mL tRNA baker’s yeast, 500 μg/mL sonicated salmon sperm DNA) was performed for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were hybridized with 400 ng/ml denatured DIG-labeled probe ON at 68 °C. After briefly washing in 2x SSC, sections were incubated in 0.2x SSC for 2 h at 68 °C. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA hybrids were detected using anti-digoxigenin FAB fragments conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche, 1:5000) and stained with NBT/BCIP (Roche). Using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (ThermoFisher), sections were mounted and staining was visualized on a digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Nanozoomer) or using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope.
Timed pregnant mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Brains of the embryos were isolated and fixed in 4% PFA in PBS. Fixed brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. After embedding in 7.5% gelatin and 10% sucrose, brains were frozen and stored at -80 o C. Sections of 20 μm were cut on a cryostat and air-dried for 2 hr. The tissue was blocked with blocking solution consisting of 4% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at RT. Following this, sections were treated with primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4 o C ON. The antibodies we used were goat anti-NEO1 (1:200, AF1079; R&D systems) and sheep anti-RGMB (1:200, AF3597; R&D systems). After washing with PBS the next day, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500, Alexa Fluor 488, Life Technologies) in PBS at RT for 1 hr. Sections were washed and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (ThermoFisher). Optionally, sections were counterstained with fluorescent Nissl stain (NeuroTrace, Invitrogen) 1:500 for 15 min at RT, washed in PBS and embedded in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich). Staining was visualized on confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM 880, Zeiss) or using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope.
For anti-GFP DAB immunohistochemistry, sections were washed in TBS (pH 7.4), quenched in 3% H 2 O 2 and 10% methanol in TBS for 15 min, and incubated in blocking buffer (TBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.4% BSA) for 1 hr at RT. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (A11122; Invitrogen) 1:2000 in blocking buffer. The next day, sections were washed in TBS and incubated with biotin-labeled secondary antibody 1:500 in TBS containing 0.4% BSA for 1.5 hr at RT. Sections were washed in TBS and incubated with avidin-biotin complex (ABC; Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) for 90 min. Then, sections were briefly washed in TBS and incubated with 3.3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution to visualize primary antibody binding. Finally, sections were rinsed twice in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, dehydrated in ascending alcohol concentrations, cleared in xylene and embedded in Entellan (Merck).
COS-7 cells were transfected with wild type mouse NEO1 ( pCMVXL-6-NEO1 ), GFP-NEO1 ( pcDNA3.1-CMV-GFP-NEO1 ) or pcDNA3.1 ( pcDNA3.1(-)/myc-his ; Invitrogen). After 2 days in culture, culture medium was replaced with HBHA buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 1x Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; GIBCO, Invitrogen) and 0.5 mg/ml BSA) for 15 min at RT. Subsequently, cells were incubated with AP-ligands for 75 min, while gently rotating at RT, followed by 2 washes in HBHA buffer. Then, cells were incubated in fixation solution (20 mM HEPES, pH 7, 60% (v/v) acetone and 3.7% formaldehyde) for 30 seconds, followed by 2 washes in HBHA. HBHA was replaced by HBS (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl) and endogenous phosphatase activity was heat-inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 90 min. Cells were equilibrated in detection buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl 2 ) and bound AP-ligand was visualized by incubation in detection buffer containing levamisole and NBT/BCIP (Roche). The specificity of RGMA-AP ligand binding was determined by competition with excess RGMA protein. Furthermore, no staining was observed for AP alone.
Sections were fixed by immersion in -20°C methanol for 6 min and rehydrated in TBS+ (TBS, pH 7.4, 4 mM MgCl 2 and 4 mM CaCl 2 ). Section were incubated in blocking buffer (TBS+ and 10% FBS (Lonza, BioWhittaker)) for 1 h at and incubated with 1.5 nM AP-tagged protein-containing medium for 2 h at room temperature. After washing in TBS+, sections were incubated with fixation solution (20 mM HEPES, pH 7, 60% (v/v) acetone and 3.7% formaldehyde) for 2 min. After washing in TBS+, endogenous phosphatase activity was heat-inactivated by incubation at 65°C for 1 h. Section were equilibrated in detection buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl 2 ) and bound AP-protein was visualized by incubation in detection buffer containing levamisole and NBT/BCIP (Roche). The specificity of RGMA-AP protein binding was determined by competition with excess RGMA protein. Furthermore, no staining was observed for AP alone.
Pull down samples were separated in a NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gel following the manufacturer's description (Invitrogen). For mass spectrometry analysis, proteins were visualized using GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Thermo-Fisher). Silver staining was used to detect differential protein bands. The gel was soaked twice in 50% methanol, followed by a 10 min incubation in 5% methanol. After 3 rinses in water, the gel was incubated in 10 μM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 20 min, followed by 0.1% (w/v) AgNO 3 for 20 min. The gel was washed once in water and twice in developer solution (3% (w/v) Na 2 CO 3 and 0.02% (w/v) formaldehyde). The gel was incubated in the developer solution until protein bands appeared. The staining reaction was stopped by adding 5% (w/v) citric acid.
1D SDS-PAGE gel lanes were cut into 2-mm slices using an automatic gel slicer and subjected to in-gel reduction with DTT, alkylation with iodoacetamide and digestion with trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade), essentially as described previously. Nanoflow LC-MS/MS was performed on a CapLC system (Waters, Manchester, UK) coupled to a Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in positive mode and equipped with a Z-spray source. Peptide mixtures were trapped on a JupiterTM C18 reversed phase column (Phenomenex; column dimensions 1.5 cm × 50 μm, packed in-house) using a linear gradient from 0 to 80% B (A = 0.1 M acetic acid; B = 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1 M acetic acid) in 70 min and at a constant flow rate of 200 nl/min using a splitter. The column eluent was directly sprayed into the ESI source of the mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were acquired in continuum mode; fragmentation of the peptides was performed in data-dependent mode. Peak lists were automatically created from raw data files using the Protein Lynx Global Server software (version 2.0). The background subtraction threshold for noise reduction was set to 35% (background polynomial 5). Smoothing (Savitzky-Golay) was performed (number of interactions: 1, smoothing window: 2 channels). Deisotoping and centroiding settings were: minimum peak width: 4 channels, centroid top: 80%, TOF resolution: 5000, NP multiplier: 1. Mascot search algorithm (version 2.0, MatrixScience) was used for searching against the NCBInr database that was available on the MatrixScience server. The peptide tolerance was typically set to 150 ppm and the fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.2 Da. A maximum number of 1 missed cleavage by trypsin was allowed and carbamidomethylated cysteine and oxidized methionine were set as fixed and variable modifications, respectively.
In utero electroporation was performed as describe previously (e.g. van Erp et al., 2015 101. van Erp, S. ∙ van den Heuvel, D.M.A. ∙ Fujita, Y. ...

In brief, pregnant C57BL/6j females were anaesthetized at E14.5 with isoflurane in oxygen. The abdominal cavity was opened, uterine horns were exposed and embryos counted. 1.7 μl DNA mix always containing 0.2 μg/μl pCX-GFP (gift from Alain Chédotal), and 1 μg/μl pCMV-mycDDK-RGMA (Origene cat# MR206975) or 1 μg/μl pCAG:mNET1-/3xGS/mCherry (VectorBuilder), or 1 μg/μl RGMA with 0.5 μg/μl NET1, or 1 μg/μl NET1 with 1 μg/μl pSuper-shNEO1 or 1 μg/μl pSuper-Scrambled ( van Erp et al., 2015 101. van Erp, S. ∙ van den Heuvel, D.M.A. ∙ Fujita, Y. ...

Conditions were randomized among mothers by dividing all embryos in a single uterus into two to three groups. Heads were held with a 1 cm platinum tweezer electrode (Harvard apparatus) coupled to the negative pole and a third gold-plated positive electrode (Harvard apparatus) was placed on top of the midline of the head. Five 50 ms pulses of 30 V were given with an interval of 950 ms using a BTX square pulse electroporator (Harvard apparatus). Uterine horns were carefully placed back in the abdomen, and muscle and skin layers were sutured separately. 5 mg/ml/10g mouse EdU (ThermoFischer) was administered i.p. in the mother at 24 h after surgery. Embryos were isolated at E16.5 or E17.5 and brains were rapidly dissected and immersion-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for no more than 24 h. Brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and immersed in 7.5% gelatin-10% sucrose for cryostat sectioning. 20 μm cryosections were blocked in 2% gelatin and 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS for 1 hr and primary antibody (chicken anti-GFP (1:2000, AVES) was incubated overnight at room temperature in the same buffer. Followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies (donkey anti-chicken IgY 488, 1:750, Jackson Immunoresearch). EdU was revealed using the Click-It EdU Cell proliferation kit for imaging, Alexa Fluor 647 dye (ThermoFisher), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Sections were counterstained with DAPI, mounted in mowiol and imaged for quantification on a Zeiss Axiovision epifluorescent microscope with a 20x objective. For each brain, images were taken from 3 consecutive sections starting from the first section that showed a connected corpus callosum. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop, where 3 stacks of 8 (in case of E16.5) or 4 (in case of E17.5) square bins were placed using the DAPI channel. In case of E16.5, the stack of 8 bins reached from the bottom of the subventricular zone until the top of the cortical plate. In case of E17.5, the 4 bins covered the entire cortical plate. GFP-positive or EdU-positive migrating cells in each bin were manually counted and represented as a percentage of the total number of cells in the entire stack of bins. All values of 3 bins in the 3 images per brain were averaged and this was used as a final score (n). At least 3 brains were counted per condition. Graphs were made and statistical analysis (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Sidaks multiple comparisons) was performed using Prism software. Publication images were prepared using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with 20x objective.
For co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of RGMB from adult mouse brain, three cortices of adult mice were lyzed in 3 ml of lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 0.4% NP-40, protease inhibitor (cOmplete, Sigma-Aldrich), phosphatase inhibitor (Cocktail 2, Sigma-Aldrich)). Lysate was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Then the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min and supernatant was collected. 100 μl of supernatant was kept for Western blot as input. The rest of the lysate was split into half, one of these halves was incubated with 0.5 μg of non-specific sheep IgGs (R&D Systems 5-001-A) and the other half with 0.5 μg of sheep anti-RGMB antibody (R&D AF3597), followed by incubation with 5 μl of magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G, Thermofisher) for 1hr at 4°C on a rotating wheel. Then, the beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. For Western blot, 5 μl of lysate was loaded on gel and in case of beads the entire content of the beads.
E18.5 and P0 dissected brains were lysed in 1500 μl lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40 and 200 ng/μl albumin from chick egg white (CEA; Sigma-Aldrich) and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C while rotating and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Cleared supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-GFP antibody (ab290; Abcam) and incubated rotating at 4 °C. After 2 h, 10 μl protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen), which had been blocked in blocking buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol and 200 ng/μl CEA (Sigma-Aldrich)), was added to each sample and samples were incubated for 40 min rotating at 4 °C. Brain lysates of either 4 Syn-GFP-NEO1 or 4 wild type littermates were pooled and beads were washed 4 times in washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 1% NP-40). Precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 70 °C.
Different parts of the brain were lysed in 400 μl lysis buffer (40 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 0.4% NP-40, protease inhibitor (cOmplete, Sigma-Aldrich), phosphatase inhibitor (Cocktail 2, Sigma-Aldrich)). Lysates were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Then the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. For Western blot, 20 μl of supernatant was loaded on the gel.
Protein samples (cell lysate, brain lysate or content of beads after IP) were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Amersham Protran 0.45 μm NC, 10600002) in Tris-Glycine buffer with 10% methanol. Membranes were washed with TBS/0.1% Tween and blocked with blocking buffer (5% milk (ELK, Campina) in TBS/0.1% Tween) for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer, washed 3 x 5 min in TBS/0.1% Tween, incubated with secondary antibody diluted in TBS/0.1%Tween (1:10,000), and again washed 3 x 5 min in TBS/0.1% Tween. The peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized using the SuperSignal (34076, ThermoFisher) reagent and FluorChem E (FE0285, Proteinsimple) imaging system. For re-staining of the membrane of the co-immunoprecipitation experiment, the membrane was incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS; 0.8% beta-mercaptoethanol; in H 2 O) for 5 min at 60°C. The membrane was washed 3 times for 5 min in TBS/0.1% Tween and processed for another antibody. The membrane was first stained for NET1, then for NEO1 and last for RGMB. Primary antibodies used were sheep anti-RGMB antibody (AF3597, R&D; 1:500); rat anti-NET1 (MAB1109, R–D); goat anti-NEO1 (AF1079, R&D; 1:500); rabbit anti-GFP antibody (ab290, Abcam, 1:6000); mouse anti-FLAG (Stratagene, 1:2000); mouse anti-α-Tubulin (T5168, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:8000); rabbit anti-NEO1 antibody (sc-15337, Santa Cruz, 1:500). Secondary antibodies used were rabbit anti-sheep peroxidase conjugated (Abcepta ASR1953); donkey anti-goat peroxidase conjugated (705-035-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch); and goat anti-rat peroxidase conjugated (sc-2065, Santa Cruz), goat anti-mouse peroxidase conjugated (A0168, Merck) and goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugated (111-035-003, Jackson Immunoresearch).
For calculations of Fourier shell correlations (FSC), the FSC cut-off criterion of 0.143 was used. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
For SPR, non-linear regression curve fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism ( www.graphpad.com ).
SEC-MALS scattering data were analyzed and molecular weight was calculated using ASTRA 6 software (Wyatt).
PLA statical analysis was carried out using a two-tailed, unpaired t-test from 3 individual, independent experiments.
Growth cone collapse was quantified for more than 100 neurons per condition, for three to six independent experiments. The criterion for the collapsed growth cones was loss of lamellipodia and the presence of only two or fewer filopodia. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism using one-way ANOVA (or two-way ANOVA for Emx1-Cre;DCC-flox experiment) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test.
For the SVZ-NSC differentiation and proliferation assay images were analyzed using ImageJ. The single TUJ1, EdU and DAPI channels were first thresholded. Then Edu- positive, TUJ1-positive and DAPI-positive cells were counted using the Analyze Particles function in ImageJ. For both assays three biological replicates were performed (n = 3), each technical replicate contained 2 coverslips. To test the differences between conditions one-way ANOVA was performed in GraphPad Prism.
For the SVZ-NSC migration assay images were analyzed using ImageJ. Cells that were outside the neurosphere and positive for TUJ1 and the neuronal migration marker doublecortin (DCX) were considered to be migrating neurons. Each experimental group contained 9 to 18 coverslips, and per coverslip between 4 and 6 SVZ NSCs were imaged. The number of migrating cells per neurosphere per condition was normalized to the vehicle (negative control). Bartlett’s test was used to test for a significant difference between the standard deviations. When the input data did not meet the criteria for Bartlett’s test, the Brown-Forsythe test was performed to test for a significant difference between the standard deviations. For normally distributed data, one-way ANOVA (or two-way ANOVA for Emx1-Cre;DCC-flox experiment) and post hoc Tukey’s test were performed to test the difference between groups. For not normally distributed data Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test were performed. For the RGMB assay, a paired two-tailed t-test was performed. All statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism, Migration distances of DCX/TUJ1+ cells were analyzed by measuring the distance between the nucleus and the edge of the neurosphere. For the RGMA/RGMB-related assays this was measured for all migrating neurons. For the assays concerning the NET1 ΔNTR and NET1 WT -Interface1 and NET1 WT -Interface2, the migration distance of a randomly selected subset of neurons was analyzed.
For migration distance quantification of the in utero electroporation experiments for each brain, images were taken from 3 consecutive sections starting from the first section that showed a connected corpus callosum. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop, where 3 stacks of 8 (in case of E16.5) or 4 (in case of E17.5) square bins were placed using the DAPI channel. In case of E16.5, the stack of 8 bins reached from the bottom of the subventricular zone until the top of the cortical plate. In case of E17.5, the 4 bins covered the entire cortical plate. GFP-positive or EdU-positive migrating cells in each bin were manually counted and represented as a percentage of the total number of cells in the entire stack of bins. All values of 3 bins in the 3 images per brain were averaged and this was used as a final score (n). At least 3 brains were counted per condition. Graphs were made and statistical analysis (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Sidaks multiple comparisons) was performed using Graphpad Prism.
