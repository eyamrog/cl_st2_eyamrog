Title: Local hyperthermia therapy induces browning of white fat and treats obesity


Abstract: Summary

Beige fat plays key roles in the regulation of systemic energy homeostasis; however, detailed mechanisms and safe strategy for its activation remain elusive. In this study, we discovered that local hyperthermia therapy (LHT) targeting beige fat promoted its activation in humans and mice. LHT achieved using a hydrogel-based photothermal therapy activated beige fat, preventing and treating obesity in mice without adverse effects. HSF1 is required for the effects since HSF1 deficiency blunted the metabolic benefits of LHT. HSF1 regulates Hnrnpa2b1 ( A2b1 ) transcription, leading to increased mRNA stability of key metabolic genes. Importantly, analysis of human association studies followed by functional analysis revealed that the HSF1 gain-of-function variant p.P365T is associated with improved metabolic performance in humans and increased A2b1 transcription in mice and cells. Overall, we demonstrate that LHT offers a promising strategy against obesity by inducing beige fat activation via HSF1-A2B1 transcriptional axis.

Section: Introduction

Obesity, the excess accumulation of fat in adipose tissues, often entails metabolic derangement and a predisposition to metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hepatic steatosis, and cardiovascular diseases ( Ji and Guo, 2019 41. Ji, C. ∙ Guo, X. The clinical potential of circulating microRNAs in obesity Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2019; 15 :731-743 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). As an endocrine organ of pleiotropic functions, adipose tissues are classified as white, brown, and beige fat based on their anatomic location and metabolic functions ( Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014 73. Rosen, E.D. ∙ Spiegelman, B.M. What we talk about when we talk about fat Cell. 2014; 156 :20-44 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1249) PubMed Google Scholar ; Scheja and Heeren, 2019 74. Scheja, L. ∙ Heeren, J. The endocrine function of adipose tissues in health and cardiometabolic disease Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2019; 15 :507-524 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particularly, beige fat exists in clusters amid white fat and is indistinguishable from white adipocytes under basal state but undergoes a process called browning of white fat when activated, i.e., by cold stimuli or beta-adrenergic signaling, and exhibits strong induction in brown gene programs and heat production ( Barbatelli et al., 2010 11.

Beige adipocytes are a distinct type of thermogenic fat cell in mouse and human Cell. 2012; 150 :366-376 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of clinical significance, cold-inducible beige fat is found to exist in adult human around the supraclavicular region and thus offers great therapeutic potential for metabolic diseases ( van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009 85. van Marken Lichtenbelt, W.D. ∙ Vanhommerig, J.W. ∙ Smulders, N.M. ...

Previous studies implemented cold stimuli or adrenergic signaling activation as a useful way to activate beige fat ( Harms and Seale, 2013 34. Harms, M. ∙ Seale, P. Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1252-1263 Crossref Scopus (1413) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vitali et al., 2012 89.

However, these treatments have limited applications because of the various health concerns and potential cardiovascular hazards ( Bhadada et al., 2011 13.

The impact of winter cold weather on acute myocardial infarctions in Portugal Environ. Pollut. 2013; 183 :14-18 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, facing the obesity epidemic, it is urgent to discover promising gene targets and approaches to achieve safe and effective beige fat activation.
Intriguingly, hyperthermia therapy (HT), which results in temporary hyperthermia through heating methods such as sauna or hot tub bathing, has drawn increasing scientific interests as a therapeutic practice for metabolic diseases ( Brunt et al., 2016 16. Brunt, V.E. ∙ Eymann, T.M. ∙ Francisco, M.A. ... Passive heat therapy improves cutaneous microvascular function in sedentary humans via improved nitric oxide-dependent dilation J. Appl. Physiol. (1985). 2016; 121 :716-723 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Laukkanen et al., 2015 51. Laukkanen, T. ∙ Khan, H. ∙ Zaccardi, F. ... Association between sauna bathing and fatal cardiovascular and all-cause mortality events JAMA Intern. Med. 2015; 175 :542-548 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, treating T2DM patients with 3 weeks of daily hot tub bathing improved metabolic parameters including decreased HbA1, mild weight loss, and improved diabetic neuropathic symptoms ( Hooper, 1999 38. Hooper, P.L. Hot-tub therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341 :924-925 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). HT through warm water immersion also conferred metabolic improvements in various animal models ( Archer et al., 2018 5. Archer, A.E. ∙ Rogers, R.S. ∙ Von Schulze, A.T. ... Heat shock protein 72 regulates hepatic lipid accumulation Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2018; 315 :R696-R707 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data support the notion of implementing hyperthermia as a therapeutic revenue to combat obesity, though many questions remain. For example, previous studies utilized HT against whole body; thus, it is not clear which tissue plays a major role in mediating the metabolic benefits of the therapy. Moreover, prolonged hot water submersion poses potential neurological and cardiovascular risks ( Masuda et al., 2019 59. Masuda, Y. ∙ Marui, S. ∙ Kato, I. ... Thermal and cardiovascular responses and thermal sensation during hot-water bathing and the influence of room temperature J. Therm. Biol. 2019; 82 :83-89 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ) caused by increased core body temperature and stress hormones production. Lastly, though the induction of heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) has been implicated as a potential mechanism of the beneficial effects of HT ( Chung et al., 2008 26. Chung, J. ∙ Nguyen, A.K. ∙ Henstridge, D.C. ... HSP72 protects against obesity-induced insulin resistance Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :1739-1744 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ), detailed mechanistic insights are lacking. It is thus desirable to find innovative ways of locally delivered HT to avoid side effects of whole-body HT and for better mechanistic unraveling. In this regard, beige fat has recently been shown to be able to sense temperature changes in a cell-autonomous and β-adrenergic-receptor-independent way ( Ye et al., 2013 99. Ye, L. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Cohen, P. ... Fat cells directly sense temperature to activate thermogenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :12480-12485 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ), rendering it a promising metabolic target of local hyperthermia therapy (LHT).
HSF1 is a transcription factor that orchestrates cellular responses to various stresses, including heat stress, via its regulation on HSPs for protein refolding and homeostasis ( Gomez-Pastor et al., 2018 33. Gomez-Pastor, R. ∙ Burchfiel, E.T. ∙ Thiele, D.J. Regulation of heat shock transcription factors and their roles in physiology and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :4-19 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is critical in various cancers ( Dai and Sampson, 2016 28. Dai, C. ∙ Sampson, S.B. HSF1: guardian of proteostasis in cancer Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 :17-28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as longevity ( Baird et al., 2014 7. Baird, N.A. ∙ Douglas, P.M. ∙ Simic, M.S. ... HSF-1-mediated cytoskeletal integrity determines thermotolerance and life span Science. 2014; 346 :360-363 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies utilizing sequencing analysis indicated that HSF1 might regulate a broader array of target genes beyond the scope of chaperones in cancer ( Dong et al., 2019 29. Dong, B. ∙ Jaeger, A.M. ∙ Thiele, D.J. Inhibiting heat shock factor 1 in cancer: a unique therapeutic opportunity Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2019; 40 :986-1005 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mendillo et al., 2012 60. Mendillo, M.L. ∙ Santagata, S. ∙ Koeva, M. ... HSF1 drives a transcriptional program distinct from heat shock to support highly malignant human cancers Cell. 2012; 150 :549-562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, we and others have identified a molecular link between HSF1 and PGC1α, a master regulator of energy homeostasis, in multiple tissues ( Gomez-Pastor et al., 2017 32. Gomez-Pastor, R. ∙ Burchfiel, E.T. ∙ Neef, D.W. ... Abnormal degradation of the neuronal stress-protective transcription factor HSF1 in Huntington’s disease Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14405 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2015 57. Ma, X. ∙ Xu, L. ∙ Alberobello, A.T. ... Celastrol protects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction through activation of a HSF1-PGC1alpha transcriptional axis Cell Metab. 2015; 22 :695-708 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qiao et al., 2017 70. Qiao, A. ∙ Jin, X. ∙ Pang, J. ... The transcriptional regulator of the chaperone response HSF1 controls hepatic bioenergetics and protein homeostasis J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216 :723-741 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2016 97. Xu, L. ∙ Ma, X. ∙ Bagattin, A. ... The transcriptional coactivator PGC1α protects against hyperthermic stress via cooperation with the heat shock factor HSF1 Cell Death Dis. 2016; 7 :e2102 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies indicated that HSF1 may exert vital functions aside from its classic role in protein refolding. Thus, in this study, we comprehensively investigated the role of LHT in thermogenesis and fat metabolism and deciphered its mechanisms via HSF1 activation, which would provide therapeutic strategies against obesity and metabolic diseases.

Section: Results

To test whether beige adipocytes could sense hyperthermia in a cell-autonomous way, we subjected beige adipocytes to hyperthermia environment (HT, 41°C) or control (Con, 37°C) treatment. Both samples were then maintained in regular culture environments (37°C) and examined to see the impacts of hyperthermia. We found that HT of various lengths of time all induced the expression of Ucp1 , a key protein in thermogenesis, to different extents ( Figure S1 A). We chose 2-h HT in next in vitro studies for its highest Ucp1 induction. We assessed the effect of HT on thermogenesis using a small molecule thermosensitive fluorescent dye, ERthermAC, which is capable of monitoring temperature rising in thermogenic adipocytes ( Kriszt et al., 2017 47.

Cell. 2020; 77 :600-617.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, compared with control, ERthermAC fluorescent intensity was significantly decreased after HT to a similar extent under the positive control forskolin (FSK) or CL316,243 (CL) treatment, indicating higher temperature and enhanced thermogenesis in beige adipocytes ( Figure 1 A). Importantly, we found that the expression of thermogenic gene programs including Pgc1α and Ucp1 , the markers for mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis, featured significant increases in HT cells ( Figure 1 B), while the viability of beige adipocytes was not affected by HT ( Figure S1 B). In addition, HT cells were cultured in regular temperature at 37°C incubator before subjecting to various assays, thus eliminating any potential effects of hyperthermia itself on cellular temperature.
We next investigated whether LHT could activate beige fat thermogenesis in vivo . Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-crosslinked polydopamine nanoparticle (PDA), a biosafe and injectable photothermal hydrogel, is capable of converting near-infrared (NIR) light input into accurately controlled temperature output ( Cheng et al., 2019 22. Cheng, W. ∙ Zeng, X. ∙ Chen, H. ...

Zhou, Z. ∙ Yan, Y. ∙ Hu, K. ... Autophagy inhibition enabled efficient photothermal therapy at a mild temperature Biomaterials. 2017; 141 :116-124 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). We injected mice with PEG-PDA hydrogel (termed PDA) subcutaneously in bilateral inguinal white adipose tissues (iWATs), then illuminated one side of iWATs with non-invasive, non-harmful NIR laser to achieve homogeneous hyperthermia in iWAT (LHT) at 41°C ± 0.5°C for 10 min, while the other side underwent the same sham manipulation without NIR laser illumination (Sham) ( Figure 1 C). Critically, skin temperatures were elevated during LHT, while no obvious change in core body temperatures were observed during the whole process ( Figure S1 C).
Strikingly, compared with pretreatment, LHT on iWAT resulted in significantly enhanced heat production in iWAT compared with Sham iWAT of the same mouse ( Figure 1 D). Molecular analysis in iWAT showed increased mRNA levels of brown gene programs, as well as increased UCP1 protein levels in LHT group ( Figures 1 E and 1F). The higher temperature in LHT iWAT is irrelevant to hyperthermia itself, since mice were removed from NIR illumination before any assay was performed. Intriguingly, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is less sensitive to LHT, as LHT on BAT resulted in dampened responses ( Figure S1 D). In order to rule out the possibility that LHT exhibited effects via macrophages, which have been reported to be involved in beige adipocytes activation and thermogenesis ( Chen et al., 2021 20. Chen, L. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Zou, Y. ...

Nguyen, K.D. ∙ Qiu, Y. ∙ Cui, X. ... Alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamines to sustain adaptive thermogenesis Nature. 2011; 480 :104-108 Crossref Scopus (721) PubMed Google Scholar ), we depleted macrophages in iWAT and still observed sustained increase in Ucp1 expression after LHT in mice, suggesting that LHT-induced beige fat thermogenesis was independent of macrophages ( Figure S1 E). Besides, LHT in iWAT did not lead to significant changes in angiogenic or sympathetic neuron growth gene programs, which were reported to impact thermogenesis ( Pellegrinelli et al., 2018 68. Pellegrinelli, V. ∙ Peirce, V.J. ∙ Howard, L. ... Adipocyte-secreted BMP8b mediates adrenergic-induced remodeling of the neuro-vascular network in adipose tissue Nat.

Innervation of thermogenic adipose tissue via a calsyntenin 3beta-S100b axis Nature. 2019; 569 :229-235 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S1 F and S1G). Notably, we found that LHT increased blood flow in iWAT, but not in BAT, while norepinephrine (NE) levels in serum and in iWAT, NE turnover rate in iWAT, cortisol levels in serum, and thermogenic and mitochondrial gene programs in BAT were not changed in mice after LHT on iWAT ( Figures S1 H–S1K), overall demonstrating that unlike whole-body HT, LHT in iWAT caused no overt changes in stress hormone production systemically or locally and thus ruled out the possibility that the increased thermogenesis was due to sympathetic activation upon heat stress. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo data suggested that LHT promoted thermogenesis and brown gene programs in beige adipocytes in a cell-autonomous fashion.
Adult humans have been demonstrated to possess beige fat mainly in the supraclavicular region ( Jespersen et al., 2013 40. Jespersen, N.Z. ∙ Larsen, T.J. ∙ Peijs, L. ... A classical brown adipose tissue mRNA signature partly overlaps with brite in the supraclavicular region of adult humans Cell Metab. 2013; 17 :798-805 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2012 96. Wu, J. ∙ Boström, P. ∙ Sparks, L.M. ... Beige adipocytes are a distinct type of thermogenic fat cell in mouse and human Cell. 2012; 150 :366-376 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we then set out to examine the human relevance of the impact of LHT on beige fat thermogenesis. Adult male and female volunteers were set in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment. After 60-min acclimation ( van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009 85. van Marken Lichtenbelt, W.D. ∙ Vanhommerig, J.W. ∙ Smulders, N.M. ... Cold-activated brown adipose tissue in healthy men N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360 :1500-1508 Crossref Scopus (2442) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bakker et al., 2014 8. Bakker, L.E. ∙ Boon, M.R. ∙ van der Linden, R.A. ... Brown adipose tissue volume in healthy lean South Asian adults compared with white Caucasians: a prospective, case-controlled observational study Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2014; 2 :210-217 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), a thermal source of 41°C ± 0.5°C was applied locally to the supraclavicular fat depots of each subject for 20 min ( Figure 1 G). The core temperatures of all volunteers remained unperturbed along the test process ( Figure S1 L). The thermal signatures of individuals were visualized with FLIR system before LHT and recorded again after removal of heat source and a rest period to avoid the influence of hyperthermia itself on temperatures ( Figure 1 G). Afterward, the exact same experimental protocols were repeated but without thermal source application on each volunteer as Sham. As representative FLIR images shown in Figure 1 H, compared with pretreatment, LHT significantly enhanced heat production in the supraclavicular depot around the neck area compared with Sham, without affecting serum NE levels ( Figure S1 M). These results signified that LHT could also induce thermogenesis in human, possibly by the activation of beige adipocytes, without elevating core body temperature or catecholamine signaling. Of note, the effects of LHT were still present after 5-week long-term treatment, suggesting prolonged effectiveness of LHT in humans ( Figure S1 N).
Considering the acute effects of LHT on beige fat thermogenesis in mice and in humans, it is worthwhile to study the long-term impact of chronic LHT on metabolic performances. First, to eliminate any toxic effects, we examined whether PDA would cause any long-term defect in mice injected with PDA or PBS subcutaneously in bilateral iWATs and subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) ( Figure S2 A). We found that PDA group showed similar body weight accretion compared with PBS group ( Figure S2 B). Subsequent thorough comparison of organ weights, tissue morphology, and serum parameters including liver and kidney function analysis between PDA and PBS groups revealed no obvious toxicity of PDA in mice ( Figures S2 C–S2E; Table S1 ).
We then set out to test the metabolic effects of long-term LHT in mice. Bilateral LHT models were established whereas mice were injected with PDA in bilateral iWATs and subjected to HFD. They were then treated with NIR laser (HFD LHT) or Sham treated without NIR illumination (HFD Sham) once every 3 days for over 10 weeks ( Figure 2 A). Strikingly, HFD LHT mice showed significantly reduced body weights mainly contributed by a reduction in fat mass ( Figures 2 B and 2C), accompanied with enhanced cold tolerance capability ( Figure 2 D) and elevated energy expenditure ( Figure 2 E). HFD LHT group also showed better metabolic fitness, i.e., improved serum parameters ( Figure S2 F), enhanced insulin sensitivity ( Figures 2 F and 2G) compared with HFD Sham, while NE levels in serum and iWAT, food intake, and locomotor activity were similar between the two groups ( Figures S2 G–S2I). Detailed tissue analysis revealed that HFD LHT mice have significantly smaller adipose depots and largely ameliorated hepatic steatosis, with consistently smaller adipocyte sizes and less lipid accumulation in livers under histological examination ( Figures 2 H, 2I, and S2 J). Chronic LHT caused no adverse effect, as demonstrated by similar serum liver and kidney function parameters, as well as comparable major organ weights between HFD LHT and Sham mice ( Figure S2 K; Table S1 ). At the molecular level, we found increased expression of Pgc1α and Ucp1 in both mRNA and protein levels ( Figures 2 J and 2K). Of note, we observed enhanced energy expenditure and increased brown gene programs in iWAT of LHT mice in the first week of treatment (early HFD), prior to significant body weight changes and without differences in food intake ( Figures S2 L–S2N).
Thinking from a therapeutic standpoint, we applied chronic LHT on diet-induced obese (DIO) mice to study its effects in treating obesity. Mice were first fed HFD to induce a body weight increase to over 40 g, then injected with PDA in bilateral iWATs, and treated with (DIO LHT) or without NIR (DIO Sham) once every 3 days ( Figure S3 A). Prolonged treatment led to similar metabolic benefits of LHT in DIO LHT mice as in HFD LHT mice, including reduced body weights, fat mass, alleviated adipose tissue weights, improved insulin sensitivity, hepatic steatosis, and serum parameters and increased expression of Pgc1α and Ucp1 in both mRNA and protein levels ( Figures S3 B–S3K), with no obvious side effects in LHT-treated DIO mice compared with their controls ( Table S1 ). Besides, we observed increased energy expenditure in DIO LHT mice compared with Sham in the first week of treatment (early DIO), without changes in food intake or residual energy in feces ( Figures S3 L and S3M). Together, these results suggest that chronic LHT can both prevent and treat obesity and metabolic dysfunctions, possibly through the activation of beige fat in mice.
Next, we set out to unravel the mechanism of LHT on beige fat activation. HSF1 and transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1), are classic heat-responsive proteins critical in orchestrating cellular response to heat, and their functions have also been implicated in fat biology, energy metabolism, and obesity ( Baler et al., 1993 9. Baler, R. ∙ Dahl, G. ∙ Voellmy, R. Activation of human heat shock genes is accompanied by oligomerization, modification, and rapid translocation of heat shock transcription factor HSF1 Mol. Cell.

The transcriptional coactivator PGC1α protects against hyperthermic stress via cooperation with the heat shock factor HSF1 Cell Death Dis. 2016; 7 :e2102 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we delivered specific siRNA targeting Hsf1 and Trpv1, respectively, into beige adipocytes to investigate their essentialness in the metabolic responses of beige adipocytes toward LHT. Compared with scramble controls (Scr), TRPV1 knockdown caused no obvious changes possibly due to higher temperature threshold ∼43°C for TPRV1 activation ( Caterina et al., 1997 18. Caterina, M.J. ∙ Schumacher, M.A. ∙ Tominaga, M. ... The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway Nature. 1997; 389 :816-824 Crossref Scopus (6781) PubMed Google Scholar ), while HSF1 deficiency largely blunted LHT-induced Pgc1α and Ucp1 expressions in beige adipocytes ( Figure S4 A), suggesting that HSF1 might be vital for LHT-induced thermogenesis in adipose tissues.
To further test this hypothesis in vivo , we generated HSF1 fat conditional knockout mice (HSF1 FKO) by crossing Adiponectin-Cre mice with HSF1-loxp mice ( Figure S4 B). Comprehensive characterizations of the metabolic performances of HSF1 FKO mice showed that, under normal chow diet (NCD), wild-type (WT), and HSF1 FKO mice have similar body weights and body mass compositions, comparable fat depot and liver weights, and tissue morphology ( Figures S4 C–S4E). Interestingly, molecular analysis revealed that HSF1 FKO mice showed impaired thermogenic gene program in iWAT, but not in BAT, indicating that the loss of HSF1 in fat may cause a specific functional defect in iWAT ( Figure S4 F). This might be due the mild HSF1 activity under basal condition in beige adipocytes, since we found that HSF1 characterized partial nuclear localization associated with higher UCP1 expression in primary beige adipocytes ( Figure S4 G).
Next, we put WT and HSF1 FKO mice under a HFD challenge, which unveiled that HSF1 FKO mice featured increased adiposity compared with WT, as shown by elevated body weights, fat mass, adipose tissue weights, and adipocyte sizes, as well as more severe insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis ( Figures 3 A–3F and S4 H). Moreover, HSF1 deficiency in fat resulted in impaired thermogenic capability in mice, as shown by decreased core temperature during cold challenge ( Figure 3 G). Consistently, oxygen consumption was reduced in HSF1 FKO mice without alternations in NE levels in iWAT and serum, food intake, or locomotor activity, indicative of decreased energy expenditure in FKO mice ( Figures 3 H, S4 I, and S4J). These differences were not caused by an enhancement in adipogenesis in HSF1 FKO mice, since primary preadipocytes from WT and HSF1 FKO mice showed similar differentiation capacity in vitro ( Figure S4 K) and comparable expression levels of adipogenic gene programs were observed in adipose tissues of WT and HSF1 FKO mice ( Figures 3 J and S4 L). Notably, PCR array analysis and subsequent qPCR assay showed that, compared with WT, HSF1 FKO mice exhibited significantly suppressed thermogenic and mitochondrial genes accompanied with elevated white gene programs in iWAT, but not in BAT ( Figures 3 I, 3J, and S4 L).
Next, we investigated whether HSF1 plays an important role in mediating the metabolic benefits of LHT. As expected, LHT promoted significant metabolic improvements, including reduced body weighs, fat mass, and adipocyte sizes. However, these metabolic benefits of LHT were abrogated in HSF1 FKO mice, as FKO LHT and FKO Sham mice exhibited comparable increases in adiposity ( Figures 3 K and 3L). Further molecular analysis revealed that LHT failed to increase the expression levels of Pgc1α and Ucp1 in FKO LHT mice as it did in WT LHT mice ( Figure 3 M). This was recapitulated in WT and HSF1 FKO mice under thermoneutral environment without impacts on angiogenic or inflammatory gene programs ( Figures S4 M and S4N). These results unveiled a critical role of HSF1 in mediating the metabolic benefits of LHT.
To further evaluate the role of HSF1 in LHT, we utilized an adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) overexpressing an active form of HSF1 (AAV Active HSF1), which lacks the LZ2 region critical for oligomerization repression and thus remains constantly active ( Uchiyama et al., 2007 84. Uchiyama, T. ∙ Atsuta, H. ∙ Utsugi, T. ... HSF1 and constitutively active HSF1 improve vascular endothelial function (heat shock proteins improve vascular endothelial function) Atherosclerosis. 2007; 190 :321-329 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), and delivered it in iWAT of mice to induce specific increase in HSF1 mRNA levels in beige fat ( Figure S5 A). AAV Active HSF1 delivery in iWAT largely recapitulated the metabolic improvements induced by LHT in HFD mice, as demonstrated by decreased body weights and fat mass, reduced adipose tissue weights and smaller adipocytes, improved serum lipid profiles, mitigated hepatic steatosis ( Figures S5 B–S5G), as well as improved insulin sensitivity ( Figures S5 H and S5I). Consistently, HSF1 activation in mice iWAT also increased their energy expenditure and cold tolerance capacity, as well as brown gene programs and PGC1α and UCP1 protein levels in iWAT of AAV Active HSF1 group compared with AAV GFP group ( Figures S5 J–S5M). These data suggest that fat-specific Active HSF1 overexpression mimics the metabolic actions of LHT through promoting white fat browning.
To further elucidate the mechanism of HSF1 in regulating beige fat activation, we performed ChIP-seq to access the genomic landscape of HSF1-binding targets in C3H10T1/2-derived beige adipocytes. Gene ontology analysis of HSF1 binding targets enriched functions closely related to metabolic processes ( Table S2 ). To find direct target genes feature conserved metabolic regulation by HSF1, we cross-analyzed our in-house ChIP-seq dataset (GSE176375) from mice beige adipocytes with dataset from human adipocytes differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells (GSE24326) and focused on top genes involved in metabolic processes ( Lo et al., 2011 54. Lo, K.A. ∙ Bauchmann, M.K. ∙ Baumann, A.P. ... Genome-wide profiling of H3K56 acetylation and transcription factor binding sites in human adipocytes PLoS One. 2011; 6 :e19778 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A). A detailed analysis of overlapping genes showed that, in consistent with conventional HSF1 functionality, most of these HSF1 targets are involved in modulation of protein homeostasis, including classic HSF1 targets chaperon HSP90AB1, HSPA1B, HSP90AA1, HSPA8, HSP-interacting protein CHORDC1, HSPF4, HSPH1, HSPF1, co-chaperon PTGES3, as well as ubiquitin B (UBB), a peptide critical for protein ubiquitination and degradation. Intriguingly, the analysis also revealed a unique candidate, HNRNPA2B1 (A2B1), as the only RNA-binding protein and a potential HSF1 target, which piqued our interest ( Figure 4 A).
ChIP-seq analysis revealed specific enrichment of HSF1 binding on the A2b1 promoter region, while in silico prediction revealed a classic heat-shock-factor-binding element (HSE) within this region ( Figure 4 A). Subsequent ChIP assay confirmed specific HSF1 binding on the predicted HSE region of A2b1 promoter, but not on the adjacent region, in both C3H10T1/2-derived beige adipocytes and immortalized beige adipocytes. Importantly, this HSF1 binding is largely enhanced upon HT ( Figures 4 B and S5 N). As shown in luciferase assay, overexpression of active form HSF1 significantly induced A2b1 transcriptional activation, while this activation was lost by mutating the HSE site (mHSE) on the A2b1 promoter ( Figure 4 C). Echoing the results of luciferase analysis, in vitro manipulation using hyperthermia on beige adipocytes, in vivo manipulations via LHT or AAV Active HSF1 in mice iWAT, all resulted in enhanced A2b1 expression ( Figure 4 D), while HSF1 deficiency abrogated A2b1 expression both in vitro and in vivo , as demonstrated using siHSF1 delivery into beige adipocytes or iWAT of HSF1 FKO mice ( Figure 4 E). Collectively, these results signified a possible HSF1-A2B1 axis upon LHT.
Next, we examined the involvement of A2B1 in beige fat function. Of note, we found that A2b1 levels are tightly associated with beige fat function, as A2b1 showed increased expressions in iWAT in conditions that promoting white fat browning, including CL316,243 treatment and cold stimulation ( Figure 4 F), while conversely, A2b1 was downregulated in iWAT in scenarios that suppressing beige fat function, i.e., diet- (HFD) or genetic- (ob/ob) induced obese mice, aging mice, as well as mice under thermoneutral environment ( Figure 4 F). Furthermore, we found that there is a close correlation between A2b1 mRNA levels with Pgc1α and Ucp1 mRNA levels, respectively, in mice iWAT ( Figure 4 G). Functionally, A2B1 knockdown (siA2B1) decreased brown fat gene programs in beige adipocytes ( Figure 4 H). More importantly, HT-induced enhancement in Pgc1α and Ucp1 expressions are at least partially dependent on A2B1 ( Figure 4 I). Overall, these results uncovered a previously unappreciated role of A2B1 in beige fat functions, as well as an indispensable role of the HSF1-A2B1 transcription axis in mediating beige fat activation by LHT.
Next, we focused on assessing the physiological relevance of A2B1 in beige fat function and energy metabolism in vivo . We established a fat-specific A2B1 gain-of-function model by administrating an AAV carrying A2B1 construct (AAV A2B1) or control (AAV GFP) in mice iWAT. AAV A2B1 delivery achieved specific A2b1 overexpression in iWAT ( Figure S6 A). When subjected to HFD, mice with fat-A2B1 overexpression showed significant decrease in body weights, fat mass, and adipose tissue weights with smaller adipocyte sizes ( Figures 5 A and 5B). They also featured increased oxygen consumption, enhanced resistance to cold challenge, as well as improved insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis ( Figures 5 C–5E and S6 B). Both groups had similar food intake and locomotor activity ( Figure S6 C). Notably, AAV A2B1 group exhibited enhanced levels of brown gene programs, as well as increased PGC1α and UCP1 protein level in iWAT compared with AAV GFP group ( Figure 5 F).
On the other hand, we also studied the impact of HNRNPA2B1 loss of function on beige fat using mice injected with an AAV carrying shRNA targeting HNRNPA2B1 (AAV shA2B1) or control (AAV shNC) in iWAT. AAV shA2B1 delivery achieved specific knockdown of A2b1 expression in iWAT ( Figure S6 D). Upon HFD, we observed opposite phenotypes in mice with fat-A2B1 knockdown compared with mice with fat-A2B1 overexpression. AAV shA2B1 mice showed increased body weights and adiposity, decreased oxygen consumption, impaired cold tolerance, as well as more severe insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis compared with AAV shNC mice ( Figures 5 G–5K and S6 E), whereas both groups had similar food intake and locomotor activity ( Figure S6 F). A2B1 ablation in iWAT suppressed brown gene programs, as well as PGC1α and UCP1 protein levels, in AAV shA2B1 mice compared with control ( Figure 5 L).
To have a better understanding of the in vivo role of A2B1 on metabolic performances from a genetic point of view, we generated A2B1 haploinsufficient mice (A2B1 HET) that characterized an approximately 50% reduction in the A2b1 level in adipose tissues, which mimics the organismal decrease of A2b1 levels in response to physiological cues that suppress browning ( Figure S6 G). Under normal chow diet, A2B1 HET mice showed comparable body weights, adipose tissue weights, oxygen consumption, food intake, and locomotor activity to WT littermates ( Figures S6 H, S6I, and S6M). Intriguingly, we noticed that A2B1 HET mice featured increased adipocyte sizes in iWAT and impaired insulin sensitivity ( Figures S6 J–S6L), in accordance with suppressed brown gene programs in iWAT in these mice ( Figure S6 N). They also exhibited impaired thermogenic capacity as evident by more profound drops in core temperatures and blunted ability to induce Pgc1α and Ucp1 expression in iWAT upon cold challenge ( Figure S6 O). These changes in A2B1 HET mice seems to be specific to beige fat, as their BAT showed no obvious mitigation on thermogenic gene programs or cold responses, indicating a unique role of A2B1 on beige fat functionality ( Figures S6 O and S6P).
Taken together, these results emphasized an indispensable and protective role of A2B1 against DIO and metabolic dysfunctions by promoting beige fat activation in mice.
We then set out to unravel the role of A2B1 in mediating the metabolic functions of HSF1 in adipocytes. To achieve this, we overexpressed A2B1 via AAV A2B1 or vector via AAV GFP in iWAT of HSF1 FKO mice (FKO + A2B1, FKO + GFP) and compared them with WT mice treated with AAV GFP (WT + GFP). Upon HFD feeding, evaluation of metabolic parameters revealed that A2B1 overexpression in fat largely alleviated the metabolic impairments of HSF1 FKO mice ( Figures 6 A–6G). Furthermore, ectopic expression of A2B1 in iWAT of HSF1 FKO mice rescued the decreased expression of thermogenic genes in HSF1 FKO mice ( Figure 6 H). These data suggest that HSF1-A2B1 axis regulates browning of white fat to protect against obesity and metabolic dysfunction.
A2B1 is an RNA-binding protein that has been reported to be critical for miRNA maturation and mRNA splicing and processing ( Alarcón et al., 2015 3. Alarcón, C.R. ∙ Goodarzi, H. ∙ Lee, H. ...

Wang, L. ∙ Wen, M. ∙ Cao, X. Nuclear hnRNPA2B1 initiates and amplifies the innate immune response to DNA viruses Science. 2019; 365 :eaav0758 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). To decipher the exact regulatory mechanism of A2B1 in beige fat function, we first examined the levels of miR324, miR93, miR222, and miR106b, the miRNAs reported to be modulated by A2B1, upon A2B1 overexpression or knockdown ( Alarcón et al., 2015 3. Alarcón, C.R. ∙ Goodarzi, H. ∙ Lee, H. ... HNRNPA2B1 is a mediator of m 6 A-dependent nuclear RNA processing events Cell. 2015; 162 :1299-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (625) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that perturbation of A2B1 levels failed to impact these miRNA levels, indicating that A2B1 may not affect miRNAs in beige fat ( Figure S7 A). We then performed RNA-seq analysis using iWAT from fat-specific A2B1 overexpression mice or control mice. A detailed analysis of enriched gene sets impacted by A2B1 revealed that A2B1 caused more profound alterations in transcriptional events than splicing events (around 4-fold) ( Figure S7 B). Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis on oscillating genes that underwent transcriptional changes enriched for metabolism as top one pathway ( Figure S7 C, left), while KEGG analysis on gene sets that underwent splicing events enriched pathways unrelated to lipid and glucose metabolism ( Figure S7 C, right). Overall, these results indicate that the regulation of A2B1 on beige fat function may through its impact on lipid and glucose metabolic gene expression rather than splicing or miRNA processing.
A2B1 has been reported to function as a m6A reader by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target mRNAs and subsequently impact mRNA destiny, i.e., mRNA stability and mRNA translocation ( Wang et al., 2019 90. Wang, L. ∙ Wen, M. ∙ Cao, X. Nuclear hnRNPA2B1 initiates and amplifies the innate immune response to DNA viruses Science. 2019; 365 :eaav0758 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequence analysis showed the existence of specific A2B1-binding site on 3′ UTR of key genes in browning programs, including Pgc1α , Ucp1 , Elovl3 , and Cytc , which was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) analysis ( Figure 6 I). We further demonstrated that in beige adipocytes, A2B1 overexpression significantly increased the luciferase activity of a luc-reporter construct containing Pgc1α 3′ UTR (3′ UTR-WT), while deletion of the A2B1 binding site in Pgc1α 3′ UTR (3′ UTR-DEL) abrogated this activation, whereas assays using Ucp1 3′ UTR-WT and Ucp1 3′ UTR-DEL rendered similar effects ( Figure 6 J). Importantly, A2B1 knockdown reduced, while A2B1 overexpression extended, the mRNA stability of Pgc1α , Ucp1 , Elovl3 , and Cytc , suggesting that A2B1 may function through recognizing and binding to mRNAs of a specific set of key browning genes to enhance their mRNA stability ( Figures 6 K, 6L, S7 D, and S7E). In addition, consistent with the role of A2B1 as a downstream mediator of HSF1 in regulating beige fat function, we found that HSF1 deficiency reduced half-life of Pgc1α , Ucp1 , Elovl3 , and Cytc mRNA, which was reversed upon A2B1 overexpression ( Figures 6 M and S7 F). Interestingly, we found that Hsf1 and A2b1 mRNA levels, as well as A2B1-binding activities on thermogenic genes were higher in beige fat versus brown fat, which may partially explain the differential responses of beige and brown fat to LHT ( Figures S7 G and S7H). Overall, these results support that A2B1 may regulate beige fat functions by binding to the 3′ UTR of key browning genes to enhance their mRNA stability.
For clinical relevance, we explored the association of HSF1 genetic variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) with metabolic traits in humans. Interestingly, using previously reported genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets from Shanghai Nicheng Cohort Study ( Chen et al., 2018 21. Chen, P. ∙ Hou, X. ∙ Hu, G. ... Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue: a favorable adipose depot for diabetes? Cardiovasc. Diabetol. 2018; 17 :93 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) and exome-wide association study datasets from Shanghai Fat Distribution and Disease (FADE) ( Bao et al., 2013 10. Bao, Y. ∙ Ma, X. ∙ Yang, R. ... Inverse relationship between serum osteocalcin levels and visceral fat area in Chinese men J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 98 :345-351 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified a missense variant p.Pro365Thr (c.1093C>A, rs78202224) in exon 9 of the HSF1 gene ( Figure 7 A). The genotype distribution was 9,380 subjects (93.04%) with CC, 688 subjects (6.82%) with AC, and 14 subjects (0.14%) with AA. The characteristics of different genotype subjects are shown in Table S3 . Of note, the carrying of A allele in subjects was associated with mild but significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) and serum total triglyceride ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Besides, subjects with A allele also had significantly lowered fasting glucose, lower plasma glucose levels after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and lower γ-glutamyltranspeptidase ( Figures 7 D–7G). Multiple linear regression adjusting for age and sex showed that rs78202224-A was negatively associated with BMI (β = −0.25, se = 0.12, p = 0.0478), serum total triglyceride (β = −0.02, se = 0.01, p = 0.0304), fasting plasma glucose (β = −0.07, se = 0.02, p = 0.0014), 2-h plasma glucose (β = −0.38, se = 0.07, p = 2.12 × 10 −8 ), glucose area under the curve (AUC) after OGTT (β = −27.88, se = 6.22, p = 7.51 × 10 −6 ), and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (β = −3.67, se = 1.18, p = 0.0019). Importantly, subsequent molecular studies revealed that the missense variant p.Pro365Thr (HSF1 AA) exhibited stronger activation effects on A2b1 transcription than its WT counterpart (HSF1 CC) in the luciferase assay, while HSE mutation abrogated the effect ( Figure 7 H). Besides, HSF1 AA also promoted A2b1 levels and brown fat gene programs more extensively than HSF1 CC in beige adipocytes or in mice iWAT, without affecting adipogenic genes ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Overall, these results demonstrate the potential contribution of HSF1 in human metabolism and that HSF1 activation may serve as a promising target in preventing and treating obesity.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we achieved localized LHT on beige adipocytes in vivo using PEG-PDA hydrogel. PDA is a very safe and biocompatible photothermal agent that can efficiently convert NIR light input into local heat output ( Cheng et al., 2019 22. Cheng, W. ∙ Zeng, X. ∙ Chen, H. ...

Autophagy inhibition enabled efficient photothermal therapy at a mild temperature Biomaterials. 2017; 141 :116-124 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, PEG-PDA hydrogel is used here to facilitate the repeated light illuminations in a long period ( Wang et al., 2016b 94. Wang, X. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Multi-responsive photothermal-chemotherapy with drug-loaded melanin-like nanoparticles for synergetic tumor ablation Biomaterials. 2016; 81 :114-124 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, we found no adverse effects of mice injected with PDA upon long-term observation. Of note, this study offered a proof of concept of LHT of beige fat in treating obesity and metabolic diseases. It would be worthwhile to utilize newly developed ways of PDA delivery methods, including nanopatch for needle-free and painless delivery, or other new nanomaterials capable of precise temperature control to achieve improved ways of LHT in beige fat, including in human.

Febrile temperature critically controls the differentiation and pathogenicity of T helper 17 cells Immunity. 2020; 52 :328-341.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the thermal stress used in these studies (39°C–40°C) seemed lower than that in our study (41°C ± 0.5°C), it should be noted that these studies are conducted in the context of fever; thus, the thermal stress reflects a significant change in core temperature, whereas in our study, the thermal stress is locally applied, without affecting core temperature in human or mice. Importantly, the increasing of LHT-induced local temperature to 41°C ± 0.5°C in this study did not cause overt stress to skin or adjacent tissues, as similar or even higher temperature was generally used in studies of whole-body HT in mice and in humans ( Chung et al., 2008 26.

In addition, we have shown that LHT did not alter NE levels, NE turnover rate, or cortisol levels in mice and human subjects, overall suggesting the safeness of 41°C ± 0.5°C LHT in vivo . Interestingly, it has been shown that severe burn induces browning of white fat in mice and humans via adrenergic stress and inflammation ( Abdullahi et al., 2019 1.

Metab. 2019; 317 :E751-E759 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we have eliminated a potential contribution of macrophages and stress hormones in the browning effect of LHT, it would be necessary to study the roles of other immune cells in the process of LHT, as well as the possible involvement of HSF1-A2B1 axis in burning-induced fat browning. Besides, future work on other possible mechanisms of LHT on metabolic improvements, including enhanced lipids secretion through skin ( Choa et al., 2021 23. Choa, R. ∙ Tohyama, J. ∙ Wada, S. ... Thymic stromal lymphopoietin induces adipose loss through sebum hypersecretion Science. 2021; 373 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) or adipose-tissue-intestine crosstalk ( Zhang et al., 2021 105.

Interestingly, we observed different responses of beige and brown fat to LHT, which may at least partially due to the higher expression levels of Hsf1 and A2b1 , as well as the greater A2B1-binding activities on thermogenic genes in beige adipocytes than brown adipocytes, Besides, previous studies using transponder probe implantation in brown fat indicated that BAT temperature is higher than core body temperature and would experience further elevation upon activation ( Ikeda et al., 2017 39. Ikeda, K. ∙ Kang, Q. ∙ Yoneshiro, T. ... UCP1-independent signaling involving SERCA2b-mediated calcium cycling regulates beige fat thermogenesis and systemic glucose homeostasis Nat.

Biphasic effect of melanocortin agonists on metabolic rate and body temperature Cell Metab. 2014; 20 :333-345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, BAT may be relatively insensitive to LHT compared with iWAT. In addition, high-throughput analysis and studies with genetic animal models suggested that although the majority of the gene programs or proteins are similar, there are no doubt that distinct signatures between iWAT and BAT exist ( Kazak et al., 2015 44.

Recently, we and other groups have revealed the existence of HSF1-PGC1α transcriptional axis in multiple organs including fat, muscle, liver, and brain ( Gomez-Pastor et al., 2017 32.

Commun. 2017; 8 :14405 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2015 57. Ma, X. ∙ Xu, L. ∙ Alberobello, A.T. ... Celastrol protects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction through activation of a HSF1-PGC1alpha transcriptional axis Cell Metab. 2015; 22 :695-708 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Qiao et al., 2017 70. Qiao, A. ∙ Jin, X. ∙ Pang, J. ... The transcriptional regulator of the chaperone response HSF1 controls hepatic bioenergetics and protein homeostasis J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216 :723-741 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we performed ChIP-seq to evaluate the regulatory network of HSF1 on genomic scale and revealed a HSF1-A2B1 axis that impacts the mRNA stability of various key metabolic genes, including PGC1α. Thus, HSF1 may regulate Pgc1α levels at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level for stress responses, which may be vital in maintaining cellular homeostasis, as well as in pathological states where HSF1-A2B1 axis is damaged, i.e., through obesity and aging. Moreover, besides Pgc1α , we further identified Ucp1 as a target of HSF1-A2B1 axis, suggesting a previously unappreciated broader role of HSF1 in metabolic control. Future work on a comprehensive picture of HSF1’s function in energy metabolism is warranted.
An interesting observation of this study is that hyperthermia induces thermogenesis by activating beige fat. This seemingly contradictory phenomenon could be explained by a role of HSF1 in mitohormesis ( Labbadia et al., 2017 48. Labbadia, J. ∙ Brielmann, R.M. ∙ Neto, M.F. ... Mitochondrial stress restores the heat shock response and prevents proteostasis collapse during aging Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :1481-1494 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tharp et al., 2021 81.

Adhesion-mediated mechanosignaling forces mitohormesis Cell Metab. 2021; 33 :1322-1341.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this sense, heat stress has been shown to induce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ( Yu et al., 2019 101. Yu, T. ∙ Dohl, J. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Astaxanthin but not quercetin preserves mitochondrial integrity and function, ameliorates oxidative stress, and reduces heat-induced skeletal muscle injury J. Cell. Physiol. 2019; 234 :13292-13302 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unchecked ROS production causes cell death in the scenario of lethal high temperature, while non-lethal hyperthermia causes perturbation, which activates HSF1 and triggers mitohormesis with long-term beneficial effects for cellular and organismal health ( Labbadia et al., 2017 48. Labbadia, J. ∙ Brielmann, R.M. ∙ Neto, M.F. ...

Mitohormesis. Cell Metab. 2014; 19 :757-766 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, PGC1α, a strong inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis, has been shown to induce a potent antioxidant stress resistance program, i.e., in brain and heart, thus promote mitochondrial ROS balance ( Bouitbir et al., 2012 15. Bouitbir, J. ∙ Charles, A.L. ∙ Echaniz-Laguna, A. ... Opposite effects of statins on mitochondria of cardiac and skeletal muscles: a ‘mitohormesis’ mechanism involving reactive oxygen species and PGC-1 Eur. Heart J. 2012; 33 :1397-1407 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; St-Pierre et al., 2006 78. St-Pierre, J. ∙ Drori, S. ∙ Uldry, M. ... Suppression of reactive oxygen species and neurodegeneration by the PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators Cell. 2006; 127 :397-408 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1697) PubMed Google Scholar ). Meanwhile, UCP1 is reported to enhance mitochondrial proton leak and inhibit mitochondrial ROS production through a feedback mechanism ( Chan et al., 2010 19. Chan, S.L. ∙ Wei, Z. ∙ Chigurupati, S. ... Compromised respiratory adaptation and thermoregulation in aging and age-related diseases Ageing Res. Rev. 2010; 9 :20-40 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hoerter et al., 2004 36. Hoerter, J. ∙ Gonzalez-Barroso, M.D. ∙ Couplan, E. ... Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 expressed in the heart of transgenic mice protects against ischemic-reperfusion damage Circulation. 2004; 110 :528-533 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is possible that hyperthermia induces the mitohormesis response through HSF1 activation to restore mitochondrial ROS balance through its regulation of Pgc1α and Ucp1 , which in turn enhances thermogenesis as their innate functions. Consistent with this notion, it has been demonstrated that mitochondrial ROS induces UCP1 Cys253 sulfenylation and UCP1 activation ( Chouchani et al., 2016 24. Chouchani, E.T. ∙ Kazak, L. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Mitochondrial ROS regulate thermogenic energy expenditure and sulfenylation of UCP1 Nature. 2016; 532 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ), which also point to a potential link between hyperthermia and thermogenesis via mitochondria ROS levels. Meanwhile, HSF1 activation may promote metabolic benefits through its role as a mitohormesis inducer via multiple mechanism, i.e., protection of protein homeostasis and restoring cellular redox balance.
Of clinical significance, we revealed the association of a gain-of-function HSF1 missense variant p. Pro365Thr with improved human BMI and metabolic traits. Interestingly, the variant characterized Pro365Thr substitution in the regulatory domain (RD) of HSF1. The activity of HSF1 has been reported to be regulated by various post-translational modifications including acetylation, phosphorylation, and sumoylation in its RD ( Gomez-Pastor et al., 2018 33. Gomez-Pastor, R. ∙ Burchfiel, E.T. ∙ Thiele, D.J. Regulation of heat shock transcription factors and their roles in physiology and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :4-19 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, HSF1 hyperphosphorylation has been shown to result in HSF1 transactivation under heat shock or its agonist celastrol treatment ( Holmberg et al., 2001 37. Holmberg, C.I. ∙ Hietakangas, V. ∙ Mikhailov, A. ... Phosphorylation of serine 230 promotes inducible transcriptional activity of heat shock factor 1 EMBO J. 2001; 20 :3800-3810 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ; Soncin et al., 2003 77. Soncin, F. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Chu, B. ... Transcriptional activity and DNA binding of heat shock factor-1 involve phosphorylation on threonine 142 by CK2 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303 :700-706 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westerheide et al., 2004 95. Westerheide, S.D. ∙ Bosman, J.D. ∙ Mbadugha, B.N. ... Celastrols as inducers of the heat shock response and cytoprotection J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :56053-56060 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ), while phosphorylation of various sites within HSF1 RD, i.e., S363 and T367, have been reported to negatively regulate HSF1 transcriptional activity ( Asano et al., 2016 6. Asano, Y. ∙ Kawase, T. ∙ Okabe, A. ... IER5 generates a novel hypo-phosphorylated active form of HSF1 and contributes to tumorigenesis Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :19174 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chu et al., 1998 25. Chu, B. ∙ Zhong, R. ∙ Soncin, F. ... Transcriptional activity of heat shock factor 1 at 37 degrees C is repressed through phosphorylation on two distinct serine residues by glycogen synthase kinase 3 and protein kinases Calpha and Czeta J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :18640-18646 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). The HSF1 Pro365Thr variant falls within S363 and T367, two negative regulatory phosphorylation sites. Threonine is an amino acid residue frequently subjected to phosphorylation modification. It is thus possible that Pro365Thr mutation results in a positive regulatory phosphorylation site in RD, thus enhancing HSF1 transcriptional activity, or interfering S363/T367 phosphorylation and blunting their repressive function. Although the structure of HSF1 N-terminal DNA-binding domain has been solved, the crystal structure of its RD domain remains a mystery ( Neudegger et al., 2016 63. Neudegger, T. ∙ Verghese, J. ∙ Hayer-Hartl, M. ... Structure of human heat-shock transcription factor 1 in complex with DNA Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 :140-146 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). It would be interesting to perform future structural study to clarify the exact function of HSF1 Pro365Thr variant.
The major finding of this work signifies LHT as a promising strategy against obesity by inducing beige fat activation via the HSF1-A2B1 transcriptional axis. Future studies to investigate other possible mechanisms for the beneficial effects of LHT would provide more comprehensive understanding. Besides, it would be interesting to further understand the mechanisms underneath the differential responses of beige and brown fat under LHT. Additionally, it would be important to generate humanized knockin mice to provide genetic evidences of HSF1 SNPs on energy metabolism. Further clinical studies are warranted to investigate the long-term effects of LHT on weight control and metabolic parameters in obese or diabetic patients.

All mouse lines and plasmids generated in this study are available from the Lead Contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with procedures approved by the ethics committee of Animal experiments of East China Normal University. Mice were allocated to experimental groups randomly. 8-week male C57BL/6J mice were used in the study. Mice with a targeted deletion of HSF1 in adipose tissues (Adiponectin-Cre Hsf1 loxp/loxp ) were generated by crossing the Hsf1 loxp/loxp mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the adiponectin promoter (Adiponectin-Cre). Littermates expressing no Cre (WT mice) were used as a control group throughout the experiments. Hnrnpa2b1 heterozygous mice were generated by Shanghai Bioray Laboratory with single strand exon 2-6 deletion. Mice were kept at 22°C at room temperature under a 12-hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. For thermoneutral environment, mice were kept at 30°C in a temperature-controlled chamber (LP-80LED-6CTAR, NK system).
8-week-old mice were injected with PDA/PEG hydrogel (PDA) ( Wang et al., 2016b 94. Wang, X. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Multi-responsive photothermal-chemotherapy with drug-loaded melanin-like nanoparticles for synergetic tumor ablation Biomaterials. 2016; 81 :114-124 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ) bilaterally in inguinal fat pads (iWAT) and the skin areas covering beige fat were illuminated with an 808-nm near-infrared (NIR) laser for 10 minutes (LHT) for each session, while the other group underwent the same protocol but without NIR illumination (Sham). The NIR intensity and iWAT loci temperature were closely monitored during the whole illumination period to ensure a local hyperthermia of 41±0.5°C in the inguinal area. The temperature was raised to indicated degrees within 0.5 minutes and maintained for 10 minutes. Core temperatures were monitored during the experimental process with a rectal thermometer (Braintree, TH-5) and skin temperatures were recorded with an infrared thermal imaging camera (Magnity Electronics). Mice were returned to normal housing environment at 22°C after treatment. For chronic LHT, LHT group were treated with illumination for 10 minutes while Sham group were sham treated once every three days. For acute experiment, mice were treated with illumination unilaterally on one side of iWAT (LHT) for 10 minutes while the other side of iWAT remained unilluminated (Sham). Images were taken with an infrared camera (FLIR E60, FLIR Systems) or tissue samples were collected after 24 hours.
For LHT on BAT, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane during the whole operation, and the incision site was shaved and disinfected using 70% ethanol. A longitudinal incision at the interscapular region was performed to expose the brown fat as previously reported ( Sveidahl Johansen et al., 2021 79. Sveidahl Johansen, O. ∙ Ma, T. ∙ Hansen, J.B. ... Lipolysis drives expression of the constitutively active receptor GPR3 to induce adipose thermogenesis Cell. 2021; 184 :3502-3518.e33 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). PDA was bilaterally injected into both lobes of the brown fat and the incisions were sutured after injection. After surgery, all mice received carprofen (5 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Animals were received carprofen (5mg/kg) and monitored daily till the wound healing. LHT group were then treated with illumination at interscapular region at 41±0.5°C for 10 min while Sham group were sham treated.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated overexpression of mouse Hsf1 active form, Hnrnpa2b1, control (GFP), shRNA targeting Hnrnpa2b1 and scrambled control (GFP) were constructed, amplified, and purified by Hanbio biotechnology (Shanghai, China). A total of 50 μl of 1 ∗ 10 9 Vg/μl of each AAV diluted in PBS was injected into the inguinal fat pads of mice ( Jimenez et al., 2018 42. Jimenez, V. ∙ Jambrina, C. ∙ Casana, E. ... FGF21 gene therapy as treatment for obesity and insulin resistance EMBO Mol. Med. 2018; 10 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were monitored for changes in body weight, fat mass, cold tolerance, and oxygen consumption, then mice were sacrificed and tissues were dissected for further analysis.
In prior to macrophage depletion, 8-weeks old mice were injected with PDA/PEG hydrogel (PDA) bilaterally in inguinal fat pads. Two days later, these mice were injected with 110mg/kg of clodronate-loaded liposomes (Liposoma, CP-005-005) every two days for three times. Afterwards, skin areas covering beige fat were illuminated unilaterally on one side of iWAT with an 808-nm near-infrared (NIR) laser for 10 min (LHT) while the other side of iWAT remained unilluminated (Sham). Mice were sacrificed to collect iWAT tissues for further analysis after 24 h.
The study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the East China Normal University and all the subjects have signed informed consent to participate in the study (HR 042-2021). The study involved 33 healthy individuals (17 males, 16 females) with ages of 24.6 (SD±1.8) years and with normal BMI of 22.01 (SD±3.53) kg/m 2 . The subjects were requested to follow a similar daily schedule, including time and composition of meals, rest/active hours and amounts of exercises, and avoid vigorous exercise, caffeine, drugs or alcohol consumption one week prior to the experiment to avoid impacts of circadian rhythm/life style on thermogenesis. For local hyperthermia therapy, each subject was in a relaxed state within a familiar, temperature- and humidity-controlled room, where they were seated in an upright posture, with arms adducted and wearing a standard test robe with head, neck, and shoulders unclothed and one meter away from a thermal imaging camera (FLIR E60, FLIR Systems) fixed on a tripod to ensure visualization of the supraclavicular depots. The test room was kept quiet and strictly undisturbed while all volunteers were instructed to maintain a relax posture with minimal movement during the whole test procedure to avoid unnecessary influences on body heat production. Participants were acclimated in the test room for one h prior to baseline imaging. After baseline imaging, the supraclavicular fat depots (around upper shoulder/upper back area) of participants were exposed to a thermal source (41±0.5°C) for 20 min. After thermal source removal, subjects were rested for 2 h and thermal images of their supraclavicular depots were taken and analyzed. Human core temperatures and skin temperatures were monitored before and after LHT. Afterwards, the exact same experimental protocols were repeated but without thermal source application on every volunteer as Sham. Serum NE levels were examined in 20 healthy individuals (10 males, 10 females) among these subjects after Sham or LHT treatment with Noradrenaline ELISA kits (LDN, BA E-5200) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These same 20 individuals were subjected to long-term LHT on Monday, Wednesday and Friday each week for 5 weeks and parameters were collected following same protocols mentioned above.

Human study was approved by Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital according to Declaration of Helsinki II. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The metabolic traits of human participants were summarized in Table S3 .
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples by QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping was performed by Infinium Asian Screening Array, Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array and Infinium Exome array platform. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) passed through quality-control procedure were further analyzed (call rate ≥98%, concordant rate ≥99% and Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was approved (P>0.01). As for participants, all subjects had call rate ≥95%. Imputation was conducted according to 504 East-Asian subjects from 1000 Genomes Project phase III, SNPs with rsq value ≥0.4 were retained. SNPs from different genotyping array were analyzed together after imputation. rs78202224 was genotyped in all subjects.
The statistical analysis was performed by PLINK ( Purcell et al., 2007 69. Purcell, S. ∙ Neale, B. ∙ Todd-Brown, K. ... PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81 :559-575 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17997) PubMed Google Scholar ) and SAS (version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were shown by different rs78202224 genotype groups. Quantitative traits with skewed distribution were logarithmically transformed. Multiple linear regression was performed after adjusting for age and sex as confounding factors.
C3H10T1/2 (ATCC) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, 11995065) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, 10270) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco, 15070063) in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Primary preadipocytes, immortalized beige and brown preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin.
For differentiation procedure, C3H10T1/2 cells were induced to differentiate to beige/brown adipocytes in differentiation medium supplemented with 5μg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, I9278), 0.5mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma-Aldrich, I5879), 5μM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, D4902), 0.125mM indomethacin (Sigma-Aldrich, I8280), 50nM T3 (Sigma-Aldrich, T2877), and 1μM rosiglitazone (Sigma-Aldrich, R2408) for two days and subsequently cultured in maintenance medium supplemented with 5μg/ml insulin, 50nM T3 and 1μM rosiglitazone. Primary preadipocytes were induced to differentiate with an adipogenic cocktail (6μg/ml insulin, 0.5mM IBMX, 1μM dexamethasone, 50nM T3, and 1μM rosiglitazone) in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep for two days and subsequently maintained in maintenance medium containing 50nM T3, 1μM rosiglitazone and 6μg/ml insulin. Immortalized beige preadipocytes were induced to differentiate to beige adipocytes in differentiation medium supplemented with 5μg/ml insulin, 0.5mM IBMX, 1μM dexamethasone, and 1μM rosiglitazone for two days and subsequently cultured in maintenance medium supplemented with 1 μM rosiglitazone and 5 μg/ml insulin. Immortalized brown preadipocytes were induced to differentiate to brown adipocytes in differentiation medium supplemented with 1μg/ml insulin, 0.5mM IBMX, 1μM dexamethasone, 0.125mM indomethacin, 1nM T3 and 1μM rosiglitazone for two days and subsequently cultured in maintenance medium supplemented with 1 nM T3 and 1 μg/ml insulin. The maintenance medium was changed every two days and mature adipocytes were collected on seventh day.
To investigate cellular thermogenesis, differentiated adipocytes on plates were maintained in a water bath for homogenized temperature changing inside incubator set at 41°C (HT) or 37°C (Con) for 0.5, 1 or 2 h. Both HT and Con cells were then placed back to 37°C. After 12 h, differentiated adipocytes were collected for gene expression analysis, cellular viability analysis (Cell Counting Kit-8, Beyotime, C0041) or treated with ERthermAC dye (250 nM, Emdmillipore, SCT057) for 30 min and subjected to FACS analysis (BD LSR Fortessainstrument).
Mice (8 weeks) were fed with chow diet or HFD (60%, ResearchDiet, D12492) for indicated time. For assessing metabolic parameters, body weight, and body compositions were measured once a week using AccuFat MRI system (AccuFat-1050, MAG-MED). Oxygen consumption, food intake and locomotor activity were measured in Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS, Columbus Instruments).
For cold exposure, mice were housed at 4°C and core temperature were measured at indicated time. For glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted overnight and injected intraperitoneally with a glucose solution in saline (1.25 g/kg body weight). For insulin tolerance test, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of insulin at 1.25 or 1.5U/kg body weights. Blood glucose levels were measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 m after injection with an automated reader (Bayer).
To measure liver triglyceride contents, liver tissues were homogenized in 5% NP40 in PBS. Tissue lysates were centrifuged and the supernatant liquid were obtained and triglyceride levels were determined by Triglycerides kit (BioVision, K622) and normalized to liver protein content using BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, P0012).
Serum parameters were measured via colorimetric assays with commercially available kits including serum triglyceride (TG, BioVision, K622), total cholesterol (TC, Sigma-Aldrich, MAK043), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, Sigma-Aldrich, MAK045), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL, Sigma-Aldrich, MAK045), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, Sigma-Aldrich, MAK052), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, Sigma-Aldrich, MAK055), Creatine kinase (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK116), Uric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK077), Creatinine (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK080), Urea nitrogen (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK006), Albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, 09753), Total protein (Sigma-Aldrich, 71285-M), Alkaline phosphatase (Abcam, ab83369), Amylase (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK009) and Lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK066). Serum and iWAT norepinephrine (NE) levels were determined by ELISA kit (CUSABIO, CSB-E07870m). Serum Cortisol levels were measured using a commercial ELISA kit (CUSABIO, CSB-E05113m).
Thermal images analysis was performed as previously reported ( Symonds et al., 2012 80. Symonds, M.E. ∙ Henderson, K. ∙ Elvidge, L. ... Thermal imaging to assess age-related changes of skin temperature within the supraclavicular region co-locating with brown adipose tissue in healthy children J. Pediatr. 2012; 161 :892-898 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the thermal images were imported into FLIR software to define the area of interest, which is the supraclavicular fat area in human and the inguinal fat area in mouse. Radiometric temperature data from the defined area were exported. The thermal images were identified with the hottest 10% points among supraclavicular area temperature in human or inguinal fat area temperature in mouse and mean values were calculated with mean value of those unified points.
NE turnover was measured on the basis of the decline in tissue NE content after the inhibition of catecholamine biosynthesis with α-methyl-p-tyrosine (α-MT) as described previously ( Shiuchi et al., 2009 76. Shiuchi, T. ∙ Haque, M.S. ∙ Okamoto, S. ... Hypothalamic orexin stimulates feeding-associated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle via sympathetic nervous system Cell Metab. 2009; 10 :466-480 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 10 min LHT or Sham on iWAT, mice were either i.p. injected with α-MT (200 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, M3281). Prior or 4 h after α-MT injection, the animals were sacrificed and iWAT were removed, weighed, and homogenized in 0.2 M perchloric acid containing 0.1 mM EDTA. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C and the NE content of the supernatants was assayed by ELISA (CUSABIO, CSB-E07870m) and normalized to iWAT weights.
Mice were injected with PDA/PEG hydrogel (PDA) bilaterally in iWAT prior to blood flow measurement. For the analysis of iWAT and BAT blood flow after LHT on iWAT, mice were anesthetized with 75 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium with i.p. injection and the fur over the interscapular or inguinal regions were carefully removed. Skin areas covering beige fat were illuminated unilaterally on one side of iWAT with NIR laser for 10 m (LHT) while the other side of iWAT remained unilluminated (Sham). Afterwards, the animals were placed in the supine (for iWAT studies) or prone (for BAT studies) position for blood flow measurements by HR-LDI (Moor Instruments) at the speed of 4 ms/pixel over the area of iWAT or BAT as previously reported ( Abreu-Vieira et al., 2015 2. Abreu-Vieira, G. ∙ Hagberg, C.E. ∙ Spalding, K.L. ... Adrenergically stimulated blood flow in brown adipose tissue is not dependent on thermogenesis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 308 :E822-E829 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Acquired images were analyzed with MoorLDI Image Processing software (research version 5.3).
Mice were housed individually with less padding and feces were collected over a 24-hour period. Then feces were dehydrated for 48 h and heat of combustion was determined using an automatic oxygen bomb calorimeter (Parr 6400). Benzoic acid standards were used to determine the calorimeter energy equivalent factor. The sample calory was normalized to dry feces weight.
HSF1 wild-type (CC), p.Pro365Thr (AA), psPAX2, and pMD2.G were used for lentiviral package. High-titer lentivirus were packaged in 293T cells using lipofectamine2000 transfection agent. Viral supernatants were collected and concentrated by centrifugation and used for adipocytes infection and mouse adipose tissue delivery.
Active form of HSF1 plasmid was constructed by deleting amino acids 186-202 of HSF1 ( Jung et al., 2008 43. Jung, A.E. ∙ Fitzsimons, H.L. ∙ Bland, R.J. ... HSP70 and constitutively active HSF1 mediate protection against CDCrel-1-mediated toxicity Mol. Ther. 2008; 16 :1048-1055 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cloned in pcDNA3.1 vector. Point mutation of HSF1 with substitution of Pro to Thr at 365AA (Pro365Thr) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Vazyme, C215). The luciferase reporter A2B1-Luc (-2007 to +261) and the putative HSE deletion reporter A2B1-dHSE-Luc (-207 to -195) was cloned into PGL4.17 basic vector. The Pgc1α /Ucp1 3′UTR or Pgc1α/Ucp1 3′UTR with deletion of the putative A2B1 binding motif were cloned into pMIR-REPORTTM. Primer pairs for plasmid construction were listed in Table S4 .
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells or tissues with RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa, 9108), and 1 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (TaKaRa, RR036A) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Quantitative Real-time PCR was performed using the Hieff® qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Low Rox Plus) (Yeasen, 11202ES03) on the Roche LightCycler480 (Roche). Experiments were repeated three times and gene expression levels were calculated using the delta Ct method, after normalization to 36B4 expression. Sequences of primers used for real-time PCR are listed in Table S4 . PCR array regarding adipocyte functionality was purchased from Qiagen (PAMM-049Z).
For RNA-seq, RNA quality was examined with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo, MA, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis. High quality RNA was used to construct library and Illumina NovaSeq6000 was used to perform RNA-seq (Genergy Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Briefly, RNA libraries were constructed by TruSeq® RNA LT Sample Prep Kit v2 (illumina, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol and quantified by Qubit (invitrogen, USA) for cluster generation. Processed RNA-seq data were filtered by removing genes with low read counts. Read counts were normalized using TMM normalization and CPM (counts per million) were calculated to create a matrix of normalized expression values. p-value <0.05 and |FC| >= 2 were used to determine differential genes. GO enrichment analysis was performed by clusterProfiler (v3.12.0) ( Yu et al., 2012 100. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters Omics. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (8038) PubMed Google Scholar ). p-value <0.05 was considered as significantly enrichment.
Cells and tissues were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher, 89900) containing PMSF (Thermo Fisher, 36978) and protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher, A32963). Total protein lysates were boiled with loading sample buffer containing 10% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, separated proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes. PVDF membrane blots were blocked in 10% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature, washed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-UCP1 (Abcam, ab10983), anti-HSF1 (CST, 4356S), anti-HNRNPA2B1 (Abcam, ab31645), mouse anti-PGC1α (Santa Cruz, sc-517380) or anti-β-ACTIN (Sigma-Aldrich, A3854). Anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR, 926-68071) was used as the second antibody for UCP1, HSF1 and HNRNPA2B1. Anti-mouse IgG (LI-COR, 926-32210) was used as the second antibody for PGC1α and β-ACTIN.
Immortalized beige adipocytes were cultured on coverslip in 48-well plates and fully differentiated, fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with primary antibodies against HSF1 and UCP1 (mouse anti-HSF1, Santa cruz, sc-17757; rabbit anti-UCP1, Abcam, ab10983) overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher, A11032) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher, A11034) for 1 h at room temperature. DAPI was used to visualize the nuclei. Images were taken using a Leica confocal microscope and processed using ImageJ.
Cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde and washed twice with PBS and rinsed with 60% isopropanol, then stained with a filtered Oil Red O working solution (Sigma-Aldrich, O0625) for 20 min at room temperature. After the cells were photographed, the Oil Red O was eluted with 60% isopropanol for 30 min at room temperature. The optical density (OD) value of each well at 520 nm was measured with colorimetric assay on BMG Labtech SPECTROstar Nano.
For ChIP-seq, ChIP assays were first performed using a SimpleChIP® Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (CST, 9003) according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, differentiated C3H10T1/2-derived beige adipocytes or immortalized beige adipocytes were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and stopped by glycine. The extracted chromatin was digested and fragmented into 200 to 1000 bp, which was then immunoprecipitated by ChIP grade antibodies anti-HSF1 (CST, 4356S) or normal IgG (CST, 2729) using Magnetic Beads. After that, samples were uncrosslinked to obtain pure DNA fragment and ChIP-seq analysis was performed by Genergy Biotechnology (Shanghai, China) using illumina Hiseq3000. Quality control was processed by FastQC software ( Andrews, 2010 4. Andrews, S. FastQC: a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data (Babraham Bioinformatics) 2010 http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ Google Scholar ). Then the filtered sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse reference (mm10) using Bowtie2 (v.2.2.5) ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 49. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (22295) PubMed Google Scholar ). For peak calling, MACS2 (v2.1.1) ( Zhang et al., 2008 104. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (7549) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to scan peaks in genomic-wide level according to each IP (treatment) and Input (control) pair. Finally, visualization is performed by Integrative Genomic Viewer genome (IGV) browser (v.2.8.0) ( Robinson et al., 2011 72. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Winckler, W. ... Integrative genomics viewer Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :24-26 Crossref Scopus (6679) PubMed Google Scholar ) using BigWig tracks. ChIP analysis was performed using same kit and protocols without sequencing. ChIP primers were listed in Table S4 .
RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was performed with Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore, 17-700) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, fully differentiated immortalized beige or brown adipocytes were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (containing RNase inhibitor, Millipore, CS203219). The extract was pre-cleared with Sepharose beads and subjected to immunoprecipitation with HNRNPA2B1 antibody (Abcam, ab31645). After extensive washing with RIP washing buffer (containing RNase inhibitor, Millipore, CS203219), co-precipitated RNAs were purified. The RNA samples precipitated were extracted, reversed transcribed, and subjected to RT-qPCR analysis.
HEK293T cells (ATCC) were transfected with indicated plasmids and luciferase reporter together with Renilla luciferase control reporter by EZ-Trans transfection reagent. Cells were collected with passive lysis buffer (Promega, E1960) and luciferase assays were performed using a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, E1960).
Dissected adipose and liver tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, HT501128-4L) and embedded in paraffin. 5μm tissue sections were stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (Beyotime, C0105S) according to manufacturer's instructions. The images were acquired by optical microscope (Nikon) using a 20x objective. Adipocyte sizes were quantified by ImageJ.
The PDA-PEG hydrogel (PDA) was prepared as previously reported ( Wang et al., 2017 93. Wang, X. ∙ Wang, C.P. ∙ Wang, X.Y. ... A polydopamine nanoparticle-knotted poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel for on-demand drug delivery and chemo-photothermal therapy Chem. Mater. 2017; 29 :1370-1376 Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar ). Briefly, PDA nanoparticles were prepared via a spontaneous oxidative polymerization of dopamine under alkaline condition. Subsequently, 0.5 mL PDA nanoparticles (50 mg/mL) and 0.5 mL 4-arm-PEG-SH (100 mg/mL) both in aqueous solution were mixed and blended on a Vortex mixer for 5 m. The mixture was kept at 4°C without disturbance or immediately used for injection.
siRNA was designed and synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). siRNA was transfected into differentiated adipocytes using Lipofectamine2000 Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher, 11668030) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The gene expression analysis was determined by RT-qPCR after 48 h.
Differentiated immortalized beige adipocytes were transfected with siNC or siRNA against Hnrnpa2b1 or adenovirus mediated Hnrnpa2b1 overexpression (Hanbio biotechnology, Shanghai, China) for two days. Cells were treated with 5μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich, SBR00013) and harvested at indicated time points. The total RNA was isolated and analyzed by RT-qPCR. The degradation rate of mRNA K d was estimated by: l n ⁡ ( 𝐶 𝑡 / 𝐶 0 ) = − 𝐾 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 , where t is the time as actinomycin D treatment for transcription inhibition. C is the mRNA concentration. The mRNA half-life t 1/2 is calculated by: 𝑡 1 / 2 = l n ⁡ 2 / 𝐾 𝑑 .
Statistics were computed with GraphPad Prism 7 software. The statistical details of experiment are indicated in the figure legend. The normalcy of data was examined by Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Statistical comparisons between two groups were made by unpaired Student’s t-test. Paired t-test was used for assessing the difference of temperature change between the same subject in Sham and LHT group. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons was used for comparisons of multiple factors and ANCOVA was used to analyze oxygen consumption data by SPSS software ( Butler and Kozak, 2010 17.
