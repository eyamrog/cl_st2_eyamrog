Title: Cell-cycle-dependent EBNA1-DNA crosslinking promotes replication termination at oriP and viral episome maintenance


Abstract: Summary

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic human herpesvirus that persists as a multicopy episome in proliferating host cells. Episome maintenance is strictly dependent on EBNA1, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with no known enzymatic activities. Here, we show that EBNA1 forms a cell cycle-dependent DNA crosslink with the EBV origin of plasmid replication oriP. EBNA1 tyrosine 518 (Y518) is essential for crosslinking to oriP and functionally required for episome maintenance and generation of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Mechanistically, Y518 is required for replication fork termination at oriP in vivo and for formation of SDS-resistant complexes in vitro . EBNA1-DNA crosslinking corresponds to single-strand endonuclease activity specific to DNA structures enriched at replication-termination sites, such as 4-way junctions. These findings reveal that EBNA1 forms tyrosine-dependent DNA-protein crosslinks and single-strand cleavage at oriP required for replication termination and viral episome maintenance.

EBNA1 binds to repetitive DNA recognition elements in the viral origin of plasmid replication ( oriP ), which consists of a family of repeats (FR) and a dyad symmetry (DS) element. The EBNA1 DBD is essential for oriP -dependent DNA replication and episome maintenance ( Frappier, 2015 31. Frappier, L. Ebna1 Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2015; 391 :3-34 PubMed Google Scholar ; Lindner and Sugden, 2007 44. Lindner, S.E. ∙ Sugden, B. The plasmid replicon of Epstein-Barr virus: mechanistic insights into efficient, licensed, extrachromosomal replication in human cells Plasmid. 2007; 58 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBNA1 binding to the DS functions as an origin of DNA replication that can recruit cellular origin recognition complex (ORC) and mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins ( Dhar et al., 2001 20.

Complex protein-DNA dynamics at the latent origin of DNA replication of Epstein-Barr virus J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116 :3971-3984 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBNA1 binding to the FR is necessary for episome maintenance and metaphase chromosome attachment as well as for enhancing replication and transcription. oriP is also a region where replication forks terminate and form recombination structures ( Dhar and Schildkraut, 1991 19.

Role of the EBNA-1 protein in pausing of replication forks in the Epstein-Barr virus genome J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :33009-33017 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two-dimensional neutral agarose gel analysis of replication structures revealed that oriP forms a strong replication fork block and recombination-like structures. The replication fork protection factors Timeless and Tipin are recruited to oriP in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and are required for formation and resolution of these structures ( Dheekollu and Lieberman, 2011 21. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Lieberman, P.M. The replisome pausing factor Timeless is required for episomal maintenance of latent Epstein-Barr virus J. Virol. 2011; 85 :5853-5863 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar structures have also been observed at the KSHV terminal repeats that serve as origin of replication and episome maintenance elements, similar to EBV oriP ( Dheekollu et al., 2013 24. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Chen, H.S. ∙ Kaye, K.M. ... Timeless-dependent DNA replication-coupled recombination promotes Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus episome maintenance and terminal repeat stability J. Virol. 2013; 87 :3699-3709 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ).
OriP is thought to function as a programmed replication termination site for the circular genome of EBV. Replication termination sites in circular genomes of bacterial and yeast plasmids typically utilize a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor, such as Tus, that can block replicative helicases, and site-specific recombinases, such as Xer, that can resolve catenated DNA molecules resulting from converging replication forks ( Bussiere and Bastia, 1999 7.

Microbiol. 1999; 31 :1611-1618 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Neylon et al., 2005 50. Neylon, C. ∙ Kralicek, A.V. ∙ Hill, T.M. ... Replication termination in Escherichia coli: structure and antihelicase activity of the Tus-Ter complex Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69 :501-526 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous studies indicate that recombination structures form at oriP at the conclusion of DNA replication, but it is not known how EBNA1 contributes to the formation or resolution of these structures. Several cellular DNA damage repair factors associate with and function at oriP , including the MRN endonuclease complex ( Dheekollu et al., 2007 22. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Deng, Z. ∙ Wiedmer, A. ... A role for MRE11, NBS1, and recombination junctions in replication and stable maintenance of EBV episomes PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 :e1257 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Timeless-Tipin replication fork protection complex ( Dheekollu and Lieberman, 2011 21. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Lieberman, P.M. The replisome pausing factor Timeless is required for episomal maintenance of latent Epstein-Barr virus J. Virol. 2011; 85 :5853-5863 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Replication termination is also known to require topoisomerases and, in some cases, resolvases ( Bastia and Zaman, 2014 2. Bastia, D. ∙ Zaman, S. Mechanism and physiological significance of programmed replication termination Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30 :165-173 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among this family of enzymes are the tyrosine recombinases that utilize a transient covalent linkage between a tyrosine residue and the phosphodiester backbone of the substrate DNA ( Castillo et al., 2017 9.

Several tyrosine recombinases are site specific and utilize sequence-specific DNA recognition with catalytic activation in response to DNA structure formation. Topoisomerases are tyrosine-based enzymes that utilize transition-state covalent interaction with the phosphate backbone, leading to transient cleavage of the DNA backbone with the function of relieving torsional strain (type I) and decatenation (type II). The structures that form at replication termination sites and collapsed replication forks require additional recombinational activities to repair the replication structure and complete synthesis of daughter DNA strands. The mechanisms required for resolution of replication fork blocks and termination structures for completion of EBV DNA at oriP are not yet known. Here we provide evidence that EBNA1 forms a transient covalent DNA adduct and single-strand cleavage through a tyrosine residue and that mutation of this tyrosine impairs the episome maintenance function of EBNA1.

Section: Results

The rapid approach to DNA adduct recovery (RADAR) was used to investigate the formation of a covalent cross-link of EBNA1 with DNA ( Figure 1 A). RADAR has been shown to capture DNA adducts such as topoisomerase II (TopoII) after treatment with etoposide ( Kiianitsa and Maizels, 2013 41. Kiianitsa, K. ∙ Maizels, N. A rapid and sensitive assay for DNA-protein covalent complexes in living cells Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :e104 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed, using RADAR, that TopoII forms a DNA adduct in the presence of etoposide ( Figure 1 B, top). We next tested the ability of EBNA1 to form DNA adducts using FLAG-tagged EBNA1 in stable cells lines carrying oriP episomes ( Figure 1 B, bottom). EBNA1 DNA adducts were detected at low levels in asynchronously growing cells, but these adducts were highly enriched in cells synchronized for late S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle ( Figure 1 B). EBNA1-DNA adducts were also recovered by RADAR from endogenous viral genomes in a latently infected Raji Burkitt lymphoma cell line ( Figure 1 D). Raji cells were fractionated by cell cycle size using centrifugal elutriation ( Figure 1 C) and then assayed by RADAR followed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting ( Figure 1 D). We found that EBNA1-DNA adducts were recovered mostly in elutriation fractions corresponding to late S and G2/M phase. TopoII-DNA adducts were also recovered in S and G2 phase, whereas no DNA adducts were detected for the DNA replication processivity factor PCNA or the control protein β-actin. Cell-cycle-enriched EBNA1-DNA adducts were also observed in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) ( Figures 1 E and 1F), indicating that this is not limited to one EBV cell line or tumor type. The specificity of RADAR for EBNA1 was further demonstrated by the lack of detectable DNA adduct formation with the single-strand DNA binding protein RPA32, the viral transcription factor EBNA2, or latency membrane protein 1 (LMP1) ( Figure 1 F).
Examination of the EBNA1 primary DNA sequence conservation and crystal structure revealed a highly conserved tyrosine residue (Y518) that is in close proximity (2.7 Å) to the DNA phosphate backbone ( Figures 2 A–2E). Tyrosine 518 was mutated to phenylalanine (Y518F) and assayed for its effect on DNA adduct formation by RADAR ( Figures 2 F and 2G). FLAG-EBNA1 wild type (WT) or Y518F was expressed at similar levels from oriP -dependent episomal plasmids ( Figure 2 F). RADAR followed by FLAG immunoprecipitation (RADAR-IP) revealed that only EBNA1 WT, but not Y518F, could be recovered. This suggests that the Y518F mutation disrupts EBNA1-DNA adduct formation. To further examine the properties of the EBNA1-DNA adduct, we performed RADAR-IP followed by DNA end labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and 32 P-ATP ( Figure 2 G). We found extensive radiolabeling of DNA with EBNA1 WT but not Y518F. Although PNK can label RNA as well as DNA, the RADAR material is resuspended in 8 mM NaOH, which should hydrolyze most RNA, suggesting that the nucleic acid adduct is primarily DNA. To further characterize the EBNA1-DNA adduct, we subjected the RADAR-IP to treatment with the single-strand-specific nuclease P1 ( Figure 2 H). P1 nuclease treatment increased the abundance of the unmodified 55-kD EBNA1 species in SDS-PAGE. The modified form of EBNA1 was also observed in RADAR-IPs from native Raji cells ( Figure S1 A). Several other single-strand DNA nucleases, including tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and ExoVII, increased migration of the unmodified EBNA1 relative to the EBNA1-DNA adduct in SDS-PAGE ( Figure S1 ). These nuclease studies support a model where EBNA1 captured by RADAR-IP is modified by a single-strand DNA-adduct linked by a tyrosine phosphodiester bond.
We compared the ability of EBNA1 WT and Y518F to interact with oriP DNA by chromatin IP (ChIP) assay ( Figure 3 A). Using standard formaldehyde crosslinking for ChIP, we found that EBNA1 Y518F bound oriP similar to the WT ( Figure 3 A, left). To test whether EBNA1 might bind covalently to oriP , we assayed whether EBNA1-DNA complexes could survive the disruptive effects of ChIP conditions of 1% SDS and high salt without formaldehyde crosslinking (native ChIP). We observed that EBNA1 WT bound with ∼30% efficiency compared with crosslinking conditions, whereas Y518F binding was not detected without formaldehyde crosslinking ( Figure 3 A, center). A similar comparison with histone H3K4me3, which is known to be enriched at oriP , revealed a strong dependence on formaldehyde crosslinking for occupancy in WT or Y518F EBNA1-expressing cells ( Figure 3 A, right). These findings suggest that a significant percentage of EBNA1 WT, but not Y518F, can bind oriP in a manner resistant to SDS denaturing conditions. To better understand the contribution of Y518 to EBNA1 DNA binding, we expressed and purified the EBNA1 DNA binding domain (DBD) for WT, Y518A, Y518F, Y518E, H468A, and N519A proteins ( Figures 3 B–3D). N519 is a neighboring amino acid that makes additional DNA contact, and H468 is in the flexible N-terminal arm and makes contact with the opposite DNA strand. DNA binding activity was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with a single binding site from the DS element of oriP . EMSA revealed that Y518F has a similar DNA binding affinity (14.6 nM) for DS as EBNA1 WT (10.4 nM), whereas Y518E had no measurable binding, and Y518A and N519A had more than 10-fold weaker binding (>100 nM) ( Figure 3 D). H468A had a 2-fold reduction in binding affinity (20 nM). These results indicate that Y518F has nearly identical DNA binding properties as EBNA1 WT in EMSA and ChIP assays but is incapable of forming a stable complex in native ChIP, similar to its failure to form complexes in RADAR.
The functional effect of Y518F- was assessed by DNA replication and plasmid maintenance assays in cells transfected with small oriP plasmids (∼10 kb) conferring hygromycin resistance ( Figures S2 and 4 ). Transient DNA replication was measured 3 days after transfection by DpnI resistance assay ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Y518F trended toward a decrease in replication activity relative to WT EBNA1, but this difference did not reach statistical significance ( Figure S2 C). We next assayed the episome maintenance function of oriP plasmids by comparing oriP episomes at 3 days relative to those retained after 20 days in culture ( Figures 4 A and 4B). We found a significant defect in Y518F for episome maintenance by Southern blot analysis. Because these plasmids carry the hygromycin resistance gene, we also assayed the ability to form hygromycin-resistant colonies 20 days post-transfection ( Figures 4 C and S3 A–S3C). Consistent with Southern blot analysis, Y518F was ∼11-fold less efficient than EBNA1 WT in forming hygromycin-resistant colonies ( Figure 4 D). These findings indicate that Y518F is deficient in episome maintenance of oriP plasmids.
The functional role of Y518 is likely to be more apparent in the context of the larger (∼170kb) viral genome and the process of EBV infection-induced B cell immortalization. To this end, we introduced the Y518F mutation into the EBV bacmid genome by recombineering ( Figure 4 E). Two independently generated WT and Y518F bacmid clones were assayed for episome maintenance in 293T cells. We found that cells carrying Y518F were significantly reduced for total EBV DNA copy number on day 21 relative to day 3 ( Figures 4 E and 4F), and this correlated with a significant defect in forming stable GFP-positive, hygromycin-resistant colonies ( Figure 4 G). To test the effect of Y518F on EBV immortalization of primary B cells, we generated an infectious virus from a single clone of transfected 293T cells with WT and Y518F bacmids. The virus was normalized by GFP units for infection of Raji cells and by viral DNA content by PCR. We then assayed identical GFP units of the virus for their ability to immortalize primary B cells from five different donors into LCLs ( Figures 4 H and 4I). Although many lymphoblast transformants could be detected for EBV WT, very few were observed with Y518F ( Figure 4 J). Of 20 individual infections with 5 different donor and two independently generated viruses, only one Y518F infection produced a slow-growing LCL. Although no mutations were identified in the EBNA1 DBD in this rare clone, we observed an ∼2-fold increase in EBNA1 and EBNA2 protein expression levels relative to WT EBV bacmid-transformed cells ( Figure S3 D).
To better understand the molecular basis for Y518 function in DNA replication and episome maintenance, we tested additional EBNA1 mutations in DNA replication and episome maintenance ( Figure 5 ). Examination of the EBNA1 crystal structure suggested that histidine 468 may contribute to Y518 DNA adduct formation because it is located in close proximity to the DNA backbone on the strand opposite Y518 ( Figures 5 A and 5B). We found that Y518A was incapable of supporting transient DNA replication ( Figures 5 C–5E), consistent with its defect in DNA binding ( Figure 3 B). H468A showed modest defects in DNA replication and episome maintenance by itself ( Figures 5 C–5E) but exacerbated the defects of Y518F in DNA replication ( Figure 5 E) and especially episome maintenance ( Figure 5 F). These findings suggest that H468 contributes to the functional activity of EBNA1 in the context of Y518F.
To explore the mechanistic basis of Y518 in episome maintenance, we performed 2D neutral agarose gel analysis to assay DNA replication and recombination structures formed in living cells ( Figures 6 A–6C). Previous studies revealed that episome maintenance correlated with cell-cycle-dependent replication fork pausing and formation of recombination structures at oriP ( Dheekollu et al., 2011 23. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Wiedmer, A. ∙ Hayden, J. ... Timeless links replication termination to mitotic kinase activation PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e19596 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells carrying oriP plasmids with EBNA1 WT or Y518F were cell cycle synchronized and then subjected to 2D neutral agarose gel analysis. As expected, we observed strong replication fork pausing (red arrow) and recombination structures typical of oriP in episomes maintained with EBNA1 WT ( Figure 6 C, top panel). In contrast, the major replication fork pausing structures were not observed at any time points for Y518F EBNA1-containing episomes ( Figure 6 C, bottom panel). A similar loss of replication termination and recombination structures with Y518F was observed in 2D alkaline agarose gels ( Figures S4 A and S4B). These findings suggest that Y518F is required for efficient replication fork pausing at oriP and that these activities correlate with EBNA1-DNA crosslinking and episome maintenance function.
We next assayed whether EBNA1 could bind and form SDS-resistant complexes with various recombination-like DNA structures in EMSA ( Figure 6 D). We assayed the ability of highly purified EBNA1 DBD WT, Y518A, Y518F, Y518E, H468A, and N519A to bind to an oligonucleotide DNA probe containing two tandem EBNA1 sites derived from the FR region (2×FR), which corresponds to the site where we observed replication termination. As expected, WT, Y518F, and H468A bound similarly to the 2×FR probe in native EMSA. Remarkably, we found that only WT EBNA1, but none of the other mutants, could form an SDS-resistant complex with the 2×FR probe ( Figure 6 D, bottom panel). These findings indicate that highly purified bacterial DBD WT has the capacity to form an SDS-resistant complex with 2×FR DNA.
We next compared the ability of full-length (FL) FLAG-tagged EBNA1 proteins purified from 293T cells to also form the SDS-resistant complex in EMSA ( Figure S6 ). We purified FLAG-EBNA1 WT, Y518F, Y518A, Y518E, and H468A and assayed these proteins by western blotting and Coomassie staining, showing similar levels of purity ( Figure S4 C). We then assayed these proteins for binding to the 2×FR probe with or without addition of 0.1% SDS in the binding reaction. We found that FLAG-EBNA1 WT, Y581F, and H468A bound similarly to 2×FR under native conditions, but only WT and H468A showed partial resistance to 0.1% SDS ( Figure S4 D). We also assayed WT and Y518F for binding to different DNA structures, including a Y-fork (Y), a nicked double-strand DNA (N), or a 4-way Holliday junction (4WJ), all containing EBNA1 binding sites ( Figure S5 ). These were then assayed for binding with or without addition of 0.1% SDS. EMSA revealed that DBD and FL-EBNA1 could bind all such structures and that the complexes formed with the 4WJ showed partial resistance to SDS ( Figure S5 C). The same samples were analyzed further by electrophoresis in SDS-EMSA at high temperatures ( Figure S5 D). Under these stringent conditions, only full-length EBNA1 WT, but not the DBD, was able to form SDS-resistant complexes with the 4WJ and to a lesser extent with the Y or N probes. Y518F did not form SDS-resistant complexes with Y or N probes but showed some residual binding with the 4WJ in the context of the full-length EBNA1.
To investigate whether EBNA1 crosslinking to the DNA phosphate backbone corresponded to endonuclease activity, we isolated the FL-EBNA1 complexes bound to 2×FR or 4WJ probes ( Figure 7 A) and assayed the radiolabeled single-strand DNA molecules by denaturing urea-PAGE ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S6 ). We found that FL-EBNA1 WT generated strong nicks at specific sites in the DNA substrate, whereas these same cleavage sites were not observed with FL-EBNA1 Y518F or Y518A ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S6 , arrows). The pattern of DNA breakage is consistent with cleavage at each of the Y518 contact sites in the 4WJ probe. These findings suggest that full-length EBNA1 derived from mammalian cells has site-specific cleavage activity dependent on Y518.

Section: Discussion

Oncogenic herpesviruses persist in tumor cells as multicopy episomes. Unraveling the mechanisms controlling this viral persistence is fundamental to our understanding of viral tumorigenesis. The episome maintenance systems of oncogenic herpesviruses typically require a virus-encoded sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (e.g., EBNA1 and LANA) that binds to multiple repeat binding sites in the genetic maintenance element of the viral genome (e.g., oriP and terminal repeat [TR]). These protein-DNA structures are known to recruit cellular replication and segregation machinery and tether viral genomes to host chromosomes as passengers during mitotic division to maintain stable episome copy numbers in proliferating cells ( De Leo et al., 2020 14. De Leo, A. ∙ Calderon, A. ∙ Lieberman, P.M. Control of Viral Latency by Episome Maintenance Proteins Trends Microbiol. 2020; 28 :150-162 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we provide evidence that the EBV EBNA1-oriP episome maintenance system involves a tyrosine-dependent covalent adduct at oriP that is important for resolution of replication termination and essential for viral episome persistence. We used RADAR to show that the EBV EBNA1- oriP complex is resistant to chaotropic and denaturing agents, consistent with formation of a covalent protein-DNA adduct. EBNA1-DNA adducts formed in a cell-cycle-dependent fashion and were enriched in late S/G2 phase. We show that a highly conserved tyrosine 518 in close proximity to the DNA phosphodiester backbone is essential for EBNA1 crosslinking to DNA. The Y518F mutation did not affect EBNA1 DNA binding under standard reaction conditions in vitro or by ChIP assay in vivo and had only minor effects in transient DNA replication assays. In contrast, Y518F severely compromised episome maintenance function for plasmids and viral episomes. Viral genomes with Y518F were crippled in their ability to immortalize primary B cells into LCLs. Mechanistically, Y518F failed to generate the recombination structures associated with replication fork termination that were readily observed with WT EBNA1 in 2D agarose gel analyses. Finally, we show that SDS-resistant EBNA1-DNA complexes formed with full-length EBNA1 bound to recombinational DNA structures, such as the 4WJ, and has single-strand cleavage activity in vitro . We propose that EBNA1 possesses previously unknown DNA crosslinking activity that proceeds through a covalent protein-tyrosyl intermediate. This activity is critical for site-specific replication termination and episome maintenance of viral genomes ( Figure 7D ).
EBNA1 is a member of a family of viral episome maintenance proteins that includes KSHV, MHV68 LANA, and HPV E2 ( De Leo et al., 2020 14. De Leo, A. ∙ Calderon, A. ∙ Lieberman, P.M. Control of Viral Latency by Episome Maintenance Proteins Trends Microbiol. 2020; 28 :150-162 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). More distant structural relatives can be found among betaherpesviruses, such as the HHV6-encoded IE2 protein, but it is not yet known whether this protein functions in episome maintenance of its respective virus ( Nishimura et al., 2017 51. Nishimura, M. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Wakata, A. ... Crystal Structure of the DNA-Binding Domain of Human Herpesvirus 6A Immediate Early Protein 2 J. Virol. 2017; 91 e01121-17 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these proteins share structural and functional features, they also have virus-specific idiosyncrasies. The EBNA1 Y518 has been shown to be part of a core domain essential for high-affinity sequence-specific DNA recognition ( Cruickshank et al., 2000 13. Cruickshank, J. ∙ Shire, K. ∙ Davidson, A.R. ... Two domains of the epstein-barr virus origin DNA-binding protein, EBNA1, orchestrate sequence-specific DNA binding J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :22273-22277 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar tyrosine residues can be identified in LANA and E2. LANA contacts DNA through several tyrosine residues, and mutation of Y1014 abolishes the episome maintenance function of LANA ( Domsic et al., 2013 26. Domsic, J.F. ∙ Chen, H.S. ∙ Lu, F. ... Molecular basis for oligomeric-DNA binding and episome maintenance by KSHV LANA PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 :e1003672 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). LANA binding at the TR also results in recombinational structures during G2 phase of the cell cycle, but the specific structures and DNA organization are different than those of EBNA1 binding at oriP ( Dheekollu et al., 2013 24. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Chen, H.S. ∙ Kaye, K.M. ... Timeless-dependent DNA replication-coupled recombination promotes Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus episome maintenance and terminal repeat stability J. Virol. 2013; 87 :3699-3709 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). E2 also appears to use conserved tyrosine residues to contact DNA, but these may be restricted to subclasses of papillomaviruses ( Bussiere et al., 1998 8. Bussiere, D.E. ∙ Kong, X. ∙ Egan, D.A. ... Structure of the E2 DNA-binding domain from human papillomavirus serotype 31 at 2.4 A Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54 :1367-1376 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Hegde and Androphy, 1998 33. Hegde, R.S. ∙ Androphy, E.J. Crystal structure of the E2 DNA-binding domain from human papillomavirus type 16: implications for its DNA binding-site selection mechanism J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284 :1479-1489 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; McBride, 2013 46. McBride, A.A. The papillomavirus E2 proteins Virology. 2013; 445 :57-79 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, although orthologs of EBNA1 may share some of these features, it is likely that they represent specialized activities best adapted to the replication strategies of their virus families.
Circular genomes from yeast and bacteria utilize site-specific recombinases to complete replication and enable faithful segregation ( Crozat et al., 2014 12. Crozat, E. ∙ Fournes, F. ∙ Cornet, F. ... Resolution of Multimeric Forms of Circular Plasmids and Chromosomes Microbiol. Spectr. 2014; 2 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). One of the functions of these recombinases is to reduce the risk of homologous recombination between multi-plasmid systems and suppress formation of dimers during DNA replication. The yeast 2-μm plasmid encodes a tyrosine recombinase, FLP, that is required to resolve post-replication genome dimers ( Jayaram et al., 2004 40. Jayaram, M. ∙ Mehta, S. ∙ Uzri, D. ... Site-specific recombination and partitioning systems in the stable high copy propagation of the 2-micron yeast plasmid Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77 :127-172 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; McQuaid et al., 2019 47. McQuaid, M.E. ∙ Mereshchuk, A. ∙ Dobson, M.J. Insights into the DNA sequence elements required for partitioning and copy number control of the yeast 2-micron plasmid Curr. Genet. 2019; 65 :887-892 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sau et al., 2019 60. Sau, S. ∙ Ghosh, S.K. ∙ Liu, Y.T. ... Hitchhiking on chromosomes: A persistence strategy shared by diverse selfish DNA elements Plasmid. 2019; 102 :19-28 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like FLP, we found that EBNA1 can bind with high affinity to 4-way junctions and introduce single-strand nicks. Some recombinases, like XerD, require accessory factors, like the FtsK translocase, to induce an active conformation required for recombinase activity ( Bigot et al., 2005 4. Bigot, S. ∙ Saleh, O.A. ∙ Lesterlin, C. ... KOPS: DNA motifs that control E. coli chromosome segregation by orienting the FtsK translocase EMBO J. 2005; 24 :3770-3780 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBNA1 may also require accessory factors, such as replication helicases, that induce DNA conformations suitable for endonuclease activation. EBNA1 may also share some functional features with the HUH site-specific endonuclease superfamily members, such as the AAV Rep protein ( Chandler et al., 2013 10. Chandler, M. ∙ de la Cruz, F. ∙ Dyda, F. ... Breaking and joining single-stranded DNA: the HUH endonuclease superfamily Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11 :525-538 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). The AAV Rep 78 protein uses a conserved tyrosine to catalyze a DNA cleavage reaction required for viral integration and resolution of replication termination. Although EBNA1 lacks many of the features of these tyrosine recombinases, we suggest that it functions to facilitate replication termination within the repetitive elements of the FR region of oriP and suppress illegitimate recombination that would otherwise lead to genome rearrangement and chromosomal integration. In this respect, EBNA1 may be considered an anti-integrase.
EBNA1 is essential for maintaining the episomal form of the viral genome during latent infection in proliferating cells. EBNA1 is not absolutely essential for immortalization of B-lymphocytes because lymphoblastoid cells can be generated, albeit at much lower efficiencies, from viral genomes that have integrated into the host genome ( Humme et al., 2003 39. Humme, S. ∙ Reisbach, G. ∙ Feederle, R. ... The EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) enhances B cell immortalization several thousandfold Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :10989-10994 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBNA1 may be dispensable for DNA replication of the viral genome because cellular replication machinery can initiate at alternative origins of DNA replication within the viral genome ( Norio and Schildkraut, 2004 52. Norio, P. ∙ Schildkraut, C.L. Plasticity of DNA replication initiation in Epstein-Barr virus episomes PLoS Biol. 2004; 2 :e152 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ott et al., 2011 54. Ott, E. ∙ Norio, P. ∙ Ritzi, M. ... The dyad symmetry element of Epstein-Barr virus is a dominant but dispensable replication origin PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e18609 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although oriP is an efficient origin, it is not absolutely required for DNA replication of the viral genome ( Ott et al., 2011 54. Ott, E. ∙ Norio, P. ∙ Ritzi, M. ... The dyad symmetry element of Epstein-Barr virus is a dominant but dispensable replication origin PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e18609 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, EBNA1 binding to oriP is absolutely required for episome maintenance. The primary mechanism of EBNA1-mediated episome maintenance is tethering the viral genome to the host chromosome. The viral genome is bound through the carboxy-terminal DBD, and the host chromosome is bound through the amino-terminal RGG/AT-hook domains (reviewed in De Leo et al., 2020 14. De Leo, A. ∙ Calderon, A. ∙ Lieberman, P.M. Control of Viral Latency by Episome Maintenance Proteins Trends Microbiol. 2020; 28 :150-162 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings suggest that EBNA1 performs an additional activity in episome maintenance that is required for efficient resolution and segregation of newly replicated circular viral genomes.
The EBNA1-DNA cross-linking activity may also contribute to protection of repetitive DNA elements in oriP , especially at the FR, where lagging-strand synthesis may be particularly vulnerable to secondary DNA structure formation and repeat loss ( Fricker and Peters, 2014 32. Fricker, A.D. ∙ Peters, J.E. Vulnerabilities on the lagging-strand template: opportunities for mobile elements Annu. Rev. Genet. 2014; 48 :167-186 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBNA1 cross-linking activity may be particularly important for maintenance of large viral genomes and, thus, important for viral genome survival during latent infection in proliferating B cells and EBV-associated tumors. Cellular mechanisms may also provide redundant and alternative mechanisms for segregating viral episomes. We also note that the endonuclease activity could only be reconstituted with the full-length EBNA1 isolated from mammalian cells. This suggest that additional domains outside of the DBD, post-translational modifications, or associated cellular proteins are required for endonuclease activity. This is also consistent with the cell cycle dependence of the EBNA1-DNA complex that could be isolated by RADAR in latently infected cells. Host cofactors have been identified for many bacteriophage tyrosine recombinases, so there is precedence that EBNA1 may require host factors to generate appropriate DNA substrates and/or complete DNA crosslinking at oriP ( Rajeev et al., 2009 56. Rajeev, L. ∙ Malanowska, K. ∙ Gardner, J.F. Challenging a paradigm: the role of DNA homology in tyrosine recombinase reactions Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73 :300-309 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ).
EBNA1 is the only viral protein that is consistently expressed in EBV-associated tumors, suggesting that it provides essential activities for tumorigenesis and, therefore, is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition. Our evidence showing that EBNA1 has tyrosine-dependent single-strand endonuclease activity provides new opportunities for inhibiting EBNA1 function in viral oncogenesis. Inhibitors of topoisomerases, such as etoposide, work by inhibiting religation of the protein-DNA phosphodiester bond, resulting in trapping of the protein-DNA adduct ( Bax et al., 2019 3. Bax, B.D. ∙ Murshudov, G. ∙ Maxwell, A. ... DNA Topoisomerase Inhibitors: Trapping a DNA-Cleaving Machine in Motion J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431 :3427-3449 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inhibitors of PARP1/2 can also trap PARP bound with high affinity to DNA, but this trapping is not through a covalent protein-DNA linkage ( Shen et al., 2015 63. Shen, Y. ∙ Aoyagi-Scharber, M. ∙ Wang, B. Trapping Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2015; 353 :446-457 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings leave open the possibility that small molecules could be developed to trap EBNA1 bound to DNA and potentially inhibit DNA replication termination and episome maintenance. Such inhibitors may be more potent than recently developed small-molecule inhibitors that block EBNA1 binding to DNA ( Messick et al., 2019 48. Messick, T.E. ∙ Smith, G.R. ∙ Soldan, S.S. ... Structure-based design of small-molecule inhibitors of EBNA1 DNA binding blocks Epstein-Barr virus latent infection and tumor growth Sci. Transl. Med. 2019; 11 :eaau5612 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ).

All unique/stable reagents generated in this study are available from the Lead Contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.
This study did not generate any unique datasets or code.
The experimental models in this study were human derived cell lines available from ATCC or from the corresponding authors laboratory. All newly generated human lymphoblastoid cell lines were generated from donor derived B-lymphocytes immortalized with recombinant EBV with EBNA1 WT or Y518F. Both male and female donors were included as the source of these LCLs.
EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell lines RAJI (gift of Diane Hayward, Johns Hopkins University) and EBV bacmid immortalized LCLs (generated at the Wistar Institute) were grown in RPMI medium (GIBCO BRL) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin (50U/ml). 293T (ATCC) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100U/ml penicillin. Cells were cultured in an incubator set at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Mammalian expression vector for Flag-EBNA1 contained B95-8 EBNA1 lacking the GA repeats (aa 101-324) under the control of CMV-3XFLAG promoter in a plasmid derived from pREP10 (Clontech) containing, oriP , GFP, and hygromycin resistance ( Dheekollu et al., 2017 25. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Malecka, K. ∙ Wiedmer, A. ... Carcinoma-risk variant of EBNA1 deregulates Epstein-Barr Virus episomal latency Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :7248-7264 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). WT EBNA1 DBD expression construct was made by PCR amplification of EBNA1 DBD (aa 459-607) using B95-8 as a template and cloned into a modified pET DUET vector containing the hexahistidine SUMO protein tag at the N terminus.
Primers were designed to generate the mutation (Y518F) in WT EBNA1 DBD and Flag EBNA1 in pRep10 plasmid (ThermoFisher). A two-stage PCR protocol for site-directed mutagenesis was adapted from Stratagene ( Wang and Malcolm, 1999 67. Wang, W. ∙ Malcolm, B.A. Two-stage PCR protocol allowing introduction of multiple mutations, deletions and insertions using QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Biotechniques. 1999; 26 :680-682 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following DpnI digestion and heat inactivation, PCR products were transformed into DH5α cells. Purified plasmids from colonies were sequenced to confirm the mutation.
Cell cycle fractionation using centrifugal elutriation was performed with a modified Beckman JE 5.0 using counter flow rates for RAJI cells as described previously ( Ritzi et al., 2003 59. Ritzi, M. ∙ Tillack, K. ∙ Gerhardt, J. ... Complex protein-DNA dynamics at the latent origin of DNA replication of Epstein-Barr virus J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116 :3971-3984 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). 293T cells transfected with either WT or Y518F plasmids were synchronized at G1/S phase of the cell cycle with 1ug/ml Aphidicolin overnight, released into S phase and collected as indicated ( Zhou et al., 2005 70. Zhou, J. ∙ Chau, C.M. ∙ Deng, Z. ... Cell cycle regulation of chromatin at an origin of DNA replication EMBO J. 2005; 24 :1406-1417 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine the cell cycle profiles of cells, cultures were either treated or left untreated and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for at least 30 min. After fixation, the cells were mixed with staining solution (0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide, 100 mg/ml RNase A) for 30 min in the dark. Samples were analyzed using an EPICS XL (Beckman-Coulter, Inc., Miami, FL), and 50,000 events were recorded. For all flow cytometry experiments, the WINMDI software program (Scripps Institute) was used to analyze the data.
The PVDF membranes were blotted with the following antibodies: anti-β-actin-peroxidase (AC-15) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no. A3854), anti-EBNA1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Acris, cat no. BM3127), and anti-Flag M2-peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase [HRP]) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no. A8592), anti-Topoisomerase II rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, cat no. ab52934), anti PCNA rabbit monoclonal antibody (Abcam, cat no. ab92552) and imaging on a Amersham Imager 680.
Cell lysis and DNA protein covalent crosslink (DPCC) isolation was performed as described previously ( Kiianitsa and Maizels, 2013 41. Kiianitsa, K. ∙ Maizels, N. A rapid and sensitive assay for DNA-protein covalent complexes in living cells Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :e104 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar , 2014 42. Kiianitsa, K. ∙ Maizels, N. Ultrasensitive isolation, identification and quantification of DNA-protein adducts by ELISA-based RADAR assay Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :e108 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were washed once in ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in lysis buffer MB (6 M guanidinium ithiocyanate, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.5), 20 mM EDTA, 4% Triton X-100, 1% Sarkosyl and 1% dithiothreitol) at a ratio of 1 mL MB for every 2 × 10 6 cells. A total of 20 × 10 6 cells was used for each cell cycle sample. An aliquot of lysate (10%–20%) was saved for analysis of the unfractionated extract, and nucleic acids and DPCC were precipitated from the remainder by addition of 0.5 volume of 100% ethanol followed by centrifugation. The precipitate was washed twice in 75% ethanol and immediately resuspended in freshly prepared 8 mM NaOH. To quantify DNA, a small aliquot was digested with 50 μg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen) for 3 hours at 50°C and quantified using nanodrop 2000C (Thermo-scientific) according to manufacturer instructions to determine DNA concentration.
Specific DPCs were detected using a vacuum Dot-blot manifold (Bio-Rad) or SDS-PAGE followed by immunodetection. In brief, equal amounts of DNA were diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and applied to either a nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA) membrane using a vacuum Dot-blot manifold (Bio-Rad) or analyzed on an SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Millipore) membrane.
Equal amounts of DPCs based on DNA concentration were diluted 10-fold in IP buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NEM, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA) and 1 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), Protease inhibitors (Sigma) and Phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) and precleared with Sepharose beads (Millipore) for 1 h. After incubation for 4 h to overnight with Anti-Flag M2 affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich), complexes were washed twice with IP buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, and twice with IP buffer containing no detergents. Samples were then eluted with 3 x Flag peptide (250 ng/ml) in Elution buffer (25 mM Na-HEPES 100 mM NaCl).
Kinase assays were performed in 20 μl reaction volume, containing 5 μl EDC (∼0.5 ng), 2 μl of 10x reaction buffer (700 mM Tris pH 7.6, 100 mM MgCl 2, 50 mM dithiothreitol), 5 μl [γ− 32 P]- ATP, 5 μl H 2 O, and 3 μl T4 PNK incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 30 mM. The samples were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE and were visualized using a Typhoon 9410 PhosphorImager (Cytiva).
Nuclease assays were performed in 20 μl reaction volume, containing 10 μl EDC (∼1ng), 2 μl of 10x reaction buffer specific for each nuclease. P1 nuclease buffer (200 mM acetic acid, 10 mM CaCl 2 , pH 6.0), 7 μl H 2 O, and 1 μl (10 Units) P1 nuclease. TDP1 10x buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 800 mM KCl, 20 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 400 ug/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.1% Tween 20), TDP2 10x buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 800 mM KCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 400 ug/ml BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20). ExoVII 10x buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol 80 mM EDTA). The reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then inactivated by the addition of 0.8 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and Laemli buffer. The samples were then run on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Millipore) membrane and visualized as above.
ChIP assays were performed as previously described ( Chau and Lieberman, 2004 11. Chau, C.M. ∙ Lieberman, P.M. Dynamic chromatin boundaries delineate a latency control region of Epstein-Barr virus J. Virol. 2004; 78 :12308-12319 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly 293T cells were plated and transfected as in the plasmid replication assay with FLAG-EBNA1 WT or the Y518F point mutant. Seven days post transfection, cells were synchronized with aphidicolin and S phase cells were harvested for either native or crosslinked ChIP. TaqMan qPCR performed using primers and probe detecting EBV B95.8 genome coordinates 8401-8521 adjacent to FR was designed by Themo-Fisher. Antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Trimethyl-histone H3 (Lys4) (Millipore, cat no. 07-473), anti-flag M2 mouse monoclonal (Sigma Aldrich, cat no. F1804).
EBNA1 WT or mutant (Y518F, Y518A, Y518E, H468A, N519A) DNA-binding domain (459-607) were expressed as a 6xHis SUMO fusion protein in E. coli (BL21(DE3)) competent cells (NEB) using an autoinduction procedure ( Studier, 2005 64. Studier, F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41 :207-234 Crossref Scopus (4542) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 500 mL of 2X Luria Broth supplemented with 1 mM MgSO 4 , 1000x trace metals, 50x5052 and 20xNPS were inoculated with 10 mL overnight culture and grown at 25°C for 24-30 hours. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.01% Tween 20, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mg/ml of lysozyme. Cells were lysed, sonicated, and centrifugation for 40 mins at 16000 rpm in a SS-34 fixed angle Sorvall rotor, lysate was poured over a gravity Nickel-NTA resin column. The resin was washed with 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5, 1 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Protein was eluted in the presence of wash buffer with 400 mM Imidazole. Eluted protein was concentrated using an Amicon 10 MWCO filter and further purified using a Superose 6 10/300 gel filtration column (Cytiva), which also removed the imidazole. Fractions containing His-SUMO-EBNA1 protein were digested with SUMO protease overnight at 4°C. Purified tagless protein was obtained by running the cleaved protein over a HisTrap FF prepacked column (1 mL or 5 ml, Cytiva) and collecting the flow through. Protein was concentrated and quantified using Nanodrop spectrophometer (ThermoFisher) at A 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 9.6 (E 1% = 1 mg/ml). Equalized protein concentrations were verified by SDS-PAGE.
Purified untagged EBNA1 WT DNA-binding domain (459-607) or its point mutant derivatives were incubated at the indicated concentrations (6.25 nM to 200 nM) with DNA probes (160 femtomoles). Oligonucleotide DNA probes were end-labeled with 32 P-γ-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK), and annealed in annealing buffer (50mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5); 400mM NaCl) as described ( Rass and West, 2006 57. Rass, U. ∙ West, S.C. Synthetic junctions as tools to identify and characterize Holliday junction resolvases Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408 :485-501 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT Inc. in standard desalted form. A list of oligonucleotides in provided in Key Resources Table . Binding reactions were incubated for 10 mins at room temperature in 20 μL binding buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 mM DTT, 0.25% Tween, 200 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 250 Volts in 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Bio-rad, 30% Acrylamide/Bis Solution 29:1, 1610156) in 0.5X Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The gels were subjected to autoradiography on X-ray films followed by exposure to phosphorimager screens, scanned in Typhoon, and signals quantified using ImageQuant software.
In SDS-EMSA experiments, subsequent to DNA-protein complex formation, SDS was added to 0.1% final concentration and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were then electrophoresed on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS in 0.5X Tris borate-EDTA-0.1% SDS buffer at 300 Volts in cold room.
Plasmid DNA replication assays have been described previously ( Deng et al., 2003 18. Deng, Z. ∙ Atanasiu, C. ∙ Burg, J.S. ... Telomere repeat binding factors TRF1, TRF2, and hRAP1 modulate replication of Epstein-Barr virus OriP J.

Carcinoma-risk variant of EBNA1 deregulates Epstein-Barr Virus episomal latency Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :7248-7264 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 293T (∼1 × 10 6 cells) were plated in 10 cm dishes. 24 h later cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (12 μl, Invitrogen) and 4 μg oriP plasmids expressing either FLAG-B95-8 EBNA, Y518F, or control plasmid containing oriP alone. Cells were split after 48 h, and then harvested at 72 h post transfection for both episomal DNA and protein. Episomal DNA was extracted by Hirt Lysis ( Hirt, 1967 37. Hirt, B. Selective extraction of polyoma DNA from infected mouse cell cultures J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26 :365-369 Crossref Scopus (3640) PubMed Google Scholar ). The DNA pellets were dissolved in 150 μl of 10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA buffer (pH 7.6) and 15 μl was subjected to restriction digestion with BamHI alone and 135 μl was subjected to BamHI and DpnI digestion overnight at 37°C. Pure DNA was extracted with phenol: chloroform (1:1), precipitated, and electrophoresed on a 0.9% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (PerkinElmer) for Southern blotting. Blots were visualized and quantified using a Typhoon 9410 PhosphorImager (Cytiva).
Plasmid maintenance assays have been described previously ( Dheekollu et al., 2017 25. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Malecka, K. ∙ Wiedmer, A. ... Carcinoma-risk variant of EBNA1 deregulates Epstein-Barr Virus episomal latency Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :7248-7264 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 293T cells were seeded in 6 well plates at concentrations of 0.75-1.5 × 10 5 cells/ml. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μl) and 2 μg oriP plasmids expressing CMV promoter-FLAG-EBNA1, with either WT or Y518F EBNA1, as indicated. Two or three days post transfection an equal portion of the cells were split into 15 cm plates to continue passaging and the remaining cells were harvested for Hirt Lysis and western blot analysis. Isolated DNA was subjected to BamHI digestion and resolved on 0.9% agarose gels. Southern blotting was performed as described above. After the first passage, 100 μg/ml hygromycin was added for 3-5 days. After initial selection and first passage, cells were continuously split upon reaching confluency for an additional 20-30 days without selection.
As described previously ( Dheekollu et al., 2017 25. Dheekollu, J. ∙ Malecka, K. ∙ Wiedmer, A. ... Carcinoma-risk variant of EBNA1 deregulates Epstein-Barr Virus episomal latency Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :7248-7264 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), 293T cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of oriP plasmids (REP10) expressing WT or Y518F EBNA1. The cells were split after 24 h and selected with 0.5 μg/ml of hygromycin. After 2 weeks of selection, the resulting hygromycin-resistant colonies were stained with toluidine blue (0.5 mg of toluidine blue in 2% sodium carbonate). Colonies that were at least 2 mm in size were scored as positive. Colonies were counted using a colony counting macro written with NIH Image.
293T cells were transfected with either FLAG-EBNA1 WT or Y518F containing oriP plasmid and cells were collected after 7 days post-transfection and washed once in 1X PBS. Cells (∼10 8 ) were lysed in 50 mL of Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 05% Nonidet P40, 1 mM EDTA), 1 mM PMSF containing protease inhibitors (Sigma, cat no. P8340) and Phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, cat no. 4906837001). Lysate were spun at 16000 for 10 min and immunoprecipitated with 100 μl of anti-Flag resin (Sigma, cat no. M8823). Complexes were washed with either lysis buffer or Cleavage Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 100 mg/ml BSA), 1 mM PMSF containing protease inhibitors (Sigma, cat no. P8340) and Phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, cat no. 4906837001), and eluted with Flag peptide.
Recombinant EBV B95-8 genome carries the prokaryotic F factor origin of replication, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, the chloramphenicol (CAM) resistance gene, and the hygromycin (HYG) resistance gene as described previously ( Delecluse et al., 2008 17. Delecluse, H.J. ∙ Feederle, R. ∙ Behrends, U. ... Contribution of viral recombinants to the study of the immune response against the Epstein-Barr virus Semin. Cancer Biol. 2008; 18 :409-415 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Delecluse and Hammerschmidt, 2000 16. Delecluse, H.J. ∙ Hammerschmidt, W. The genetic approach to the Epstein-Barr virus: from basic virology to gene therapy Mol. Pathol. 2000; 53 :270-279 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). The B95-8/Y518F EBNA1 genome was obtained by homologous recombination exchanging the DNA binding domain contain Y518F mutation in EBNA1 gene using two-step recombination method ( Tischer et al., 2006 65. Tischer, B.K. ∙ von Einem, J. ∙ Kaufer, B. ... Two-step red-mediated recombination for versatile high-efficiency markerless DNA manipulation in Escherichia coli Biotechniques. 2006; 40 :191-197 Crossref Scopus (649) PubMed Google Scholar ). Positive selected clones were purified and analyzed with the BamHI restriction enzyme to confirm correct recombination, which was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
Bac maintenance assay was similar to plasmid maintenance assay with the following modifications: Briefly, 293T cells were seeded in 6 well plates at concentrations of 0.75-1.5 × 10 5 cells/ml. Twenty-four hours later cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μl) and 1 mg Bac B95-8 with WT or Y518F EBNA1 genes, as indicated. Two to three days post transfection an equal portion of the cells were split into 15 cm plates to continue passaging and the remaining cells were harvested Bac DNA analysis. Isolated DNA was subjected to BamHI digestion and resolved on 0.9% agarose gels. Southern blotting was performed as described above with TR DNA probe. After the first passage, 100 μg/ml hygromycin was added for 21 days and harvested the plates for Bac DNA Southern analysis with either TR, FR or human ch17 probes.
EBV producer cell lines and virus were generated as previously described ( Shannon-Lowe et al., 2005 62. Shannon-Lowe, C. ∙ Baldwin, G. ∙ Feederle, R. ... Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell transformation: quantitating events from virus binding to cell outgrowth J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86 :3009-3019 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, rB95-8 and B95-8/Y518F EBNA1 Bac DNA was purified from 4 mL of bacterial culture according to Bacmid purification kit (NucleoBond 740579, Clonetech) and the DNA was transfected into HEK293 cells (1 mg DNA per 4x10 5 cells) using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded onto 150 mm culture plates in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and hygromycin (100 mg/ml). Eight GFP-positive colonies were expanded four weeks post transfection and tested for their ability to produce virus upon induction of the lytic cycle (Western blot, qPCR, and PFGE analysis) and selected for viral production.
Recombinant EBV was produced as described previously ( Shannon-Lowe et al., 2005 62. Shannon-Lowe, C. ∙ Baldwin, G. ∙ Feederle, R. ... Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell transformation: quantitating events from virus binding to cell outgrowth J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86 :3009-3019 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 293 producer cells for rB95-8 or B95-8/Y518F EBNA1 were induced by transfection of a BZLF1 expression plasmid with co-transfection of BALF4 expression plasmid. The supernatants were collected 4 days post-transfection and filtered through a 0.45 mm filter to remove the cell debris. To concentrate virus, the supernatant was layered onto a 10% sucrose cushion and spin at 26,000 rpm for 1 h and virus pellet was resuspended in RPMI medium. Viral gene equivalents were determined by qPCR and by infection of 10 5 Raji B cells with concentrated virus stock using quantitation methods described ( Tsai et al., 2013 66. Tsai, M.H. ∙ Raykova, A. ∙ Klinke, O. ... Spontaneous lytic replication and epitheliotropism define an Epstein-Barr virus strain found in carcinomas Cell Rep. 2013; 5 :458-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ).
B cells were purified from PBMCs (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells) using B cell enrichment Kit II (Stem Cell Technologies, cat no.19054). 2 x10 6 B cells were infected with 10 infectious particle units of recombinant virus at room temperature. After 2 weeks post infection, B cell colonies were identified and counted by light microscope using a colony counting macro written for NIH Image.
DNA for the two-dimensional (2D) gels was extracted by the modified Hirt’s method as previously described ( Follonier and Lopes, 2014 30. Follonier, C. ∙ Lopes, M. Combined bidimensional electrophoresis and electron microscopy to study specific plasmid DNA replication intermediates in human cells Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1094 :209-219 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. was performed essentially as described previously ( Willis et al., 2014 68. Willis, N.A. ∙ Chandramouly, G. ∙ Huang, B. ... BRCA1 controls homologous recombination at Tus/Ter-stalled mammalian replication forks Nature. 2014; 510 :556-559 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). For 2D gels, DNA was cut with DraI restriction enzyme to generate an ∼5.6-kb fragment containing OriP . Neutral/alkaline (N/A) electrophoresis, as described by Huberman et al. (1987) 38. Huberman, J.A. ∙ Spotila, L.D. ∙ Nawotka, K.A. ... The in vivo replication origin of the yeast 2 microns plasmid Cell. 1987; 51 :473-481 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar , was used to detect replication pausing on nascent strands. The first-dimension conditions were identical to the N/N 2D gel method, while the second dimension gel was with 0.9% agarose in water. The solidified gels were placed in electrophoresis apparatus containing alkaline electrophoresis buffer, 50 mM NaOH, 2 mM EDTA, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Electrophoresis was performed at 0.7 V/cm for 20 hr. DNA in both methods was then detected by hybridization with α- 32 P-labeled probe specific for the oriP region as above.
Cleavage assays were carried out in 20 μL cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 100 mg/ml BSA) containing ∼1 nM of the 5′- 32 P-end-labeled DNA substrates with either ∼500 ng of WT or Y518F Flag EBNA1 proteins. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, cleaved DNA products were deproteinized by addition of 5 μL of stop buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM EDTA, 2.5% SDS and 10 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubation for 30 min at 37°C. The radiolabeled products were then resuspended in formamide-dye loading buffer for electrophoresis on 8 M Urea-6% PAGE denaturing gels and analyzed as above.
All biological experiments were repeated at least 3 times (n = 3) and data was analyzed for error variation by standard deviation from the mean (sdm) and student two-tailed t test for p values using Excel and PRISM GraphPad software.
