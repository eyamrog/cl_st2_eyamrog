Title: Multiphase coalescence mediates Hippo pathway activation


Abstract: Summary

The function of biomolecular condensates is often restricted by condensate dissolution. Whether condensates can be suppressed without condensate dissolution is unclear. Here, we show that upstream regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway form functionally antagonizing condensates, and their coalescence into a common phase provides a mode of counteracting the function of biomolecular condensates without condensate dissolution. Specifically, the negative regulator SLMAP forms Hippo-inactivating condensates to facilitate pathway inhibition by the STRIPAK complex. In response to cell-cell contact or osmotic stress, the positive regulators AMOT and KIBRA form Hippo-activating condensates to facilitate pathway activation. The functionally antagonizing SLMAP and AMOT/KIBRA condensates further coalesce into a common phase to inhibit STRIPAK function. These findings provide a paradigm for restricting the activity of biomolecular condensates without condensate dissolution, shed light on the molecular principles of multiphase organization, and offer a conceptual framework for understanding upstream regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway.

Section: Introduction

The formation of biomolecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as an important mechanism of subcellular organization and spatiotemporal control of biochemical reactions ( Alberti et al., 2019 2.

For example, stress granules are dissolved when the cellular stress is removed ( Protter and Parker, 2016 41. Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Parker, R.

Many other condensates, such as P-bodies, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, paraspeckles, and PML bodies, are known to dissolve during mitosis ( Dundr and Misteli, 2010 14. Dundr, M. ∙ Misteli, T.

The Hippo signaling pathway controls tissue growth, homeostasis, and regeneration in diverse animals ( Davis and Tapon, 2019 13. Davis, J.R. ∙ Tapon, N.

The core of this pathway is a kinase cascade, wherein MST1/2 together with their partner SAV phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2 and their cofactor MOB1A/B. The activated LATS-MOB complex then phosphorylates and inactivates YAP/TAZ, which normally function as transcriptional coactivators for the TEAD transcription factors. Functioning upstream of MST1/2 is an array of positive and negative regulators that jointly control the activity of the MST-LATS-YAP core kinase cascade. These include the STRIPAK phosphatase complex ( Goudreault et al., 2009 22. Goudreault, M. ∙ D'Ambrosio, L.M. ∙ Kean, M.J. ...

A major unanswered question in Hippo signaling concerns how these upstream regulators relay diverse physiological signals such as cell contact inhibition, mechanical force, cytoskeleton remodeling, osmotic stress, energy deprivation, and bacterial infection ( Davis and Tapon, 2019 13.

Zheng, Y. ∙ Pan, D. The hippo signaling pathway in development and disease Dev. Cell. 2019; 50 :264-282 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar ). The studies to date have implicated several upstream regulators in relaying various signals to the core kinase cascade. For example, NF2 and AMOT have been implicated in Hippo signaling in response to cell contact inhibition ( Kim et al., 2011 31. Kim, N.G. ∙ Koh, E. ∙ Chen, X. ...

Inactivation of YAP oncoprotein by the Hippo pathway is involved in cell contact inhibition and tissue growth control Genes Dev. 2007; 21 :2747-2761 Crossref Scopus (2380) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the STRIPAK complex has been implicated in bacteria-triggered Hippo signaling in Drosophila ( Liu et al., 2016 35.

Toll receptor-mediated hippo signaling controls innate immunity in Drosophila Cell. 2016; 164 :406-419 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ) or lysophosphatidic-acid-induced Hippo signaling in cultured mammalian cells ( Chen et al., 2019 10. Chen, R. ∙ Xie, R. ∙ Meng, Z. ... STRIPAK integrates upstream signals to initiate the Hippo kinase cascade Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :1565-1577 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite these insights, the molecular mechanisms by which the Hippo pathway upstream regulators coordinately control the core kinase cascade in response to distinct signals are poorly understood.
In this study, we show that upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway form functionally antagonizing biomolecular condensates to regulate pathway activity. We further identify the coalescence of these Hippo-regulating condensates as a mechanism for restricting condensate activity without condensate dissolution.

Section: Results

Cell-cell contact is a well-known signal that activates Hippo signaling ( Zhao et al., 2007 64. Zhao, B. ∙ Wei, X. ∙ Li, W. ... Inactivation of YAP oncoprotein by the Hippo pathway is involved in cell contact inhibition and tissue growth control Genes Dev. 2007; 21 :2747-2761 Crossref Scopus (2380) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although F-actin cytoskeleton ( Aragona et al., 2013 3. Aragona, M. ∙ Panciera, T. ∙ Manfrin, A. ... A mechanical checkpoint controls multicellular growth through YAP/TAZ regulation by actin-processing factors Cell. 2013; 154 :1047-1059 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1189) PubMed Google Scholar ) and AMOT ( Zhao et al., 2011 63. Zhao, B. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Lu, Q. ... Angiomotin is a novel Hippo pathway component that inhibits YAP oncoprotein Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :51-63 Crossref Scopus (543) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been implicated in this process, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood ( Figure 1 A). To investigate how the F-actin binding protein AMOT ( Ernkvist et al., 2006 15. Ernkvist, M. ∙ Aase, K. ∙ Ukomadu, C. ... p130-angiomotin associates to actin and controls endothelial cell shape FEBS J. 2006; 273 :2000-2011 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) contributes to this process, we expressed CFP-AMOT fusion protein in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and examined its subcellular localization relative to F-actin. CFP-AMOT colocalized with prominent F-actin cables in MDCK cells in sparse culture ( Figure 1 B). Strikingly, in confluent cells, a condition in which F-actin cables were barely detectable, CFP-AMOT formed discrete cytoplasmic foci ( Figure 1 B, quantified in Figure S1 A). The AMOT foci displayed liquid-like features of biomolecular condensates such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fusion between adjacent foci ( Figure 1 C). In contrast to wild-type AMOT, an AMOT mutant without actin-binding (AB) domain (CFP-AMOT ΔAB ) was not localized to F-actin cables but instead formed cytoplasmic foci ( Figure 1 D, quantified in Figure S1 B) with liquid-like properties ( Figure S1 C) in sparse culture of MDCK cells. Similar results were obtained with CFP-AMOT S175E ( Figure S1 D, quantified in Figure S1 B), a point mutant defective in F-actin binding ( Chan et al., 2013 8. Chan, S.W. ∙ Lim, C.J. ∙ Guo, F. ...

Polarity-dependent distribution of angiomotin localizes Hippo signaling in preimplantation embryos Curr. Biol. 2013; 23 :1181-1194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). The formation of AMOT foci was further validated in confluent culture of CFP-AMOT knockin HEK293A cell line generated by tagging CFP to the endogenous AMOT gene using CRISPR-Cas9 system (Figures 1 E and S1 E, quantified in Figure S1 F). Together, these results suggest that F-actin may normally sequester AMOT and prevent AMOT phase separation in sparse culture. Such sequestration is relieved by cell-cell contact under high confluency.
AMOT contains multiple coil-coiled domains (CC) ( Figure 1 F). Because CC domains are known to mediate LLPS of diverse proteins ( Fang et al., 2019 16. Fang, X. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Ishikawa, R. ...

Phase transition in postsynaptic densities underlies formation of synaptic complexes and synaptic plasticity Cell. 2016; 166 :1163-1175.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ), we deleted the CC domains of AMOT (CFP-AMOT ΔCC ) and found that CFP-AMOT ΔCC did not form foci in confluent MDCK cells ( Figure S1 G). Together, these observations suggest that AMOT protein undergoes CC-domain-dependent LLPS to form biomolecular condensates upon high confluency.
To further corroborate these observations, we sought to reconstitute AMOT LLPS in vitro using purified recombinant CFP-AMOT protein ( Figure S1 H). Indeed, recombinant CFP-AMOT, but not CFP-AMOT ΔCC , readily formed micron-sized droplets ( Figure 1 G) with liquid-like features ( Figure 1 H) in a manner dependent on protein and salt concentration ( Figure S1 I), consistent with phase-separated biomolecular condensates. We then added F-actin to our in vitro reconstitution system and found that recombinant CFP-AMOT no longer formed droplets but instead formed filament-like structure overlapping the F-actin cables ( Figure 1 I). In contrast, recombinant CFP-AMOT ΔAB -mutant protein formed droplets regardless of the presence or absence of F-actin ( Figure 1 I). To exclude the possibility that F-actin localized AMOT represents phase-separated condensates wetting the actin filaments as previously described for T cell receptor condensates, we compared the dynamics of AMOT on and off F-actin in vitro and in vivo by FRAP analysis. In both scenarios, AMOT on F-actin filaments showed significantly faster dynamics than AMOT off F-actin filaments ( Figures S1 J and S1K), suggesting that AMOT does not form phase-separated condensates wetting the F-actin filaments. Together, these results are consistent with AMOT foci formation in cultured cells and its suppression by F-actin.
AMOT is known to physically interact with components of the Hippo core kinase cascade including SAV ( Couzens et al., 2013 11. Couzens, A.L. ∙ Knight, J.D. ∙ Kean, M.J. ...

Interaction proteome of human Hippo signaling: modular control of the co-activator YAP1 Mol. Syst. Biol. 2013; 9 :713 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with these reports, the in-vitro -reconstituted AMOT condensates could enrich core kinase cascade components MST/SAV complex, LATS/MOB complex, or YAP ( Figure 1 J). Together, these results suggest that cell-cell contact induces AMOT condensates capable of enriching components of the Hippo kinase cascade.
The CC-domain-dependent LLPS of AMOT prompted us to examine other upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway. Similar to AMOT, two additional Hippo pathway upstream regulators KIBRA (also called WWC1) and SLMAP (Sarcolemma a ssociated p rotein) also contain multiple CC domains ( Figure 1 F). We first examined KIBRA by in vitro LLPS reconstitution. To this end, we purified recombinant YFP-tagged KIBRA protein with or without CC domains. Similar to AMOT, recombinant YFP-KIBRA, but not YFP-KIBRA ΔCC , formed liquid-like droplets in vitro ( Figures 2 A and 2B) in a manner dependent on protein and salt concentration ( Figure S2 A).
To confirm these results in vivo , we expressed YFP-tagged KIBRA in MDCK cells. Similar to AMOT, we observed YFP-KIBRA foci in confluent but not sparse culture, which we will characterize later in this study (see Figures 3 D and 6 B). Besides cell-cell contact, we found that osmotic stress by 0.4 M sorbitol, another Hippo-activating condition ( Hong et al., 2017 27. Hong, A.W. ∙ Meng, Z. ∙ Yuan, H.X. ... Osmotic stress-induced phosphorylation by NLK at Ser128 activates YAP EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 :72-86 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ), also induced the formation of YFP-KIBRA foci ( Figure 2 C, quantified in Figure S2 B). In contrast, YFP-KIBRA ΔCC failed to form foci under the same osmotic condition ( Figure 2 C). The YFP-KIBRA foci disappeared after removal of osmotic stress ( Figure 2 D) and were similarly induced by 200 mM NaCl ( Figure S2 C). The KIBRA foci displayed liquid-like features such as FRAP and fusion ( Figure 2 E). Similar YFP-KIBRA foci were induced by osmotic stress in an YFP-KIBRA knockin HEK293A cell line generated by tagging YFP to the endogenous KIBRA gene ( Figures 2 F and S2 D, quantified in Figure S2 E). Together, these results suggest that, similar to AMOT, KIBRA also undergoes CC-dependent LLPS to form biomolecular condensates.
To explore whether KIBRA condensates occur in tissues, we turned to Drosophila . In Drosophila , Kibra was reported to be localized to both apical medial cortex and adherens junction in wing imaginal disc cells ( Su et al., 2017 49. Su, T. ∙ Ludwig, M.Z. ∙ Xu, J. ... Kibra and merlin activate the hippo pathway spatially distinct from and independent of expanded Dev. Cell. 2017; 40 :478-490.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to the mammalian KIBRA condensates, the apical-medial-cortex-localized Drosophila Kibra was detected as puncta capable of concentrating Hpo (Hippo, Drosophila homolog of MST1/2) and Wts (Warts, Drosophila homolog of LATS1/2), although they were not characterized as biomolecular condensates ( Su et al., 2017 49. Su, T. ∙ Ludwig, M.Z. ∙ Xu, J. ... Kibra and merlin activate the hippo pathway spatially distinct from and independent of expanded Dev. Cell. 2017; 40 :478-490.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the apical medial cortex pool, but not the adherens junction pool, of Kibra was suggested to be more active in promoting Hippo signaling ( Su et al., 2017 49. Su, T. ∙ Ludwig, M.Z. ∙ Xu, J. ... Kibra and merlin activate the hippo pathway spatially distinct from and independent of expanded Dev. Cell. 2017; 40 :478-490.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together with the similar size of the apical medial Kibra puncta in Drosophila wing cells and the KIBRA condensates in mammalian cells ( Figure S2 F), we hypothesized that the former likely represent biomolecular condensates. Consistent with this possibility, FRAP analysis in Drosophila wing discs revealed that the apical-medial-localized Kibra puncta recovered much slower than the adherens-junction-localized Kibra after photobleaching ( Figure S2 G). Similar to its mammalian counterpart, purified Drosophila Kibra protein readily phase-separated in vitro in a CC-domain-dependent manner ( Figures S2 H–S2J). Together, these results suggest that Drosophila Kibra forms biomolecular condensates in apical medial cortex to promote Hippo signaling, explaining why the apical-medial-cortex-localized Kibra is more active than the adherens-junction-localized Kibra as reported by Su et al. (2017) 49. Su, T. ∙ Ludwig, M.Z. ∙ Xu, J. ... Kibra and merlin activate the hippo pathway spatially distinct from and independent of expanded Dev.

KIBRA is known to physically interact with components of the Hippo core kinase cascade including SAV and LATS ( Baumgartner et al., 2010 6. Baumgartner, R. ∙ Poernbacher, I. ∙ Buser, N. ...

Kibra functions as a tumor suppressor protein that regulates Hippo signaling in conjunction with Merlin and Expanded Dev.

Consistent with these reports, the in-vitro -reconstituted KIBRA condensates could enrich the MST/SAV complex or the LATS/MOB complex ( Figure 2 G). However, unlike the AMOT condensates, the KIBRA condensates did not enrich YAP in vitro ( Figure 2 G), consistent with the presence of YAP-binding PPxY motifs in AMOT, but not in KIBRA. Together, these results suggest that osmotic stress induces KIBRA condensates to concentrate components of the Hippo kinase cascade.
AMOT and KIBRA are known to bind to each other ( Couzens et al., 2013 11. Couzens, A.L. ∙ Knight, J.D. ∙ Kean, M.J. ...

Decoding WW domain tandem-mediated target recognitions in tissue growth and cell polarity eLife. 2019; 8 :e49439 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We, therefore, asked whether they can co-phase separate into a common condensate, in much the same way that multiple interacting proteins with intrinsic LLPS abilities are assembled into stress granules ( Protter and Parker, 2016 41. Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Parker, R. Principles and properties of stress granules Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 :668-679 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1030) PubMed Google Scholar ; Riggs et al., 2020 44.

Indeed, a mixture of recombinant AMOT and KIBRA readily formed condensates containing both proteins in vitro ( Figure 3 A). In addition, when mixed together, preformed AMOT condensates and KIBRA condensates coalesced into condensates containing both proteins ( Figure 3 B). For simplicity, they will be referred to as AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates. As expected, the formation of AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates requires the PY motifs of AMOT and the WW domains of KIBRA ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Similar to AMOT or KIBRA condensates, the in-vitro -reconstituted AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates could enrich the MST/SAV complex, the LATS/MOB complex, or YAP ( Figure 3 C), suggesting a potential role for the bi-scaffold condensates in concentrating components of the Hippo kinase cascade.
To validate the bi-scaffold condensates in vivo , we expressed YFP-KIBRA in CFP-AMOT knockin HEK293A cells and induced condensate formation by high cell confluency or osmotic stress. In either condition, the condensates contained both AMOT and KIBRA ( Figures 3 D and 3E, quantified in Figures S3 C and S3D), indicating the formation of AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates in cells. AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates were also readily induced in MDCK cells ( Figure S3 E). Thus, cell-cell contact or osmotic stress, two well-known Hippo-activating conditions, induce AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates in vivo .
To investigate the cellular function of AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates, we generated AMOT/KIBRA double-deficient cells by RNAi knocking down all KIBRA family members (KIBRA, WWC2, and WWC3) in AMOT triple knockout (lacking AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2) HEK293 cells ( Mana-Capelli and McCollum, 2018 37. Mana-Capelli, S. ∙ McCollum, D. Angiomotins stimulate LATS kinase autophosphorylation and act as scaffolds that promote Hippo signaling J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :18230-18241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, AMOT/KIBRA-deficient cells showed increased YAP nuclear accumulation in cells of high confluency, and this defect was rescued by wild-type CFP-AMOT and YFP-KIBRA but not the phase separation-deficient CFP-AMOT ΔCC and YFP-KIBRA ΔCC mutants ( Figure 3 F). Also, AMOT/KIBRA-deficient cells showed diminished osmotic-stress-induced YAP phosphorylation, and this defect was rescued by wild-type CFP-AMOT and YFP-KIBRA but not the phase-separation-deficient CFP-AMOT ΔCC and YFP-KIBRA ΔCC mutants ( Figure 3 G). Consistent with the diminished YAP phosphorylation, AMOT/KIBRA-deficient cells showed upregulation of YAP target genes CYR61 , CTGF, and ANKRD1 under osmotic stress, and target gene upregulation was suppressed by wild-type CFP-AMOT and YFP-KIBRA but not the phase-separation-deficient CFP-AMOT ΔCC and YFP-KIBRA ΔCC mutants ( Figure S3 F). Taken together, these results support a role for AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates in Hippo pathway activation.
Next, we examined whether the CC-domain-containing protein SLMAP ( Figure 1 F) also undergoes LLPS. Contrary to the activator function of AMOT or KIBRA, SLMAP inhibits Hippo signaling by functioning as the MST-binding subunit of the STRIPAK phosphatase complex that directly dephosphorylates and inactivates MST ( Bae et al., 2017 4. Bae, S.J. ∙ Ni, L. ∙ Osinski, A. ... SAV1 promotes Hippo kinase activation through antagonizing the PP2A phosphatase STRIPAK eLife. 2017; 6 e30278. Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2017 65. Zheng, Y. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Wang, L. ... Homeostatic control of Hpo/MST kinase activity through autophosphorylation-dependent recruitment of the STRIPAK PP2A phosphatase complex Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3612-3623 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). We purified the CFP-SLMAP protein and found that it formed liquid-like droplets in a CC-domain-dependent manner in in vitro reconstitution ( Figures 4 A and 4B) in a manner dependent on protein and salt concentration ( Figure S4 A). As expected, the in-vitro -reconstituted CFP-SLMAP condensates could enrich MST as well as SIKE, a STRIPAK subunit that bridges SLMAP to the rest of the STRIPAK complex ( Jeong et al., 2021 28. Jeong, B.C. ∙ Bae, S.J. ∙ Ni, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of the Hippo signaling integrator human STRIPAK Nat. Struct. Mol.

Architecture, substructures, and dynamic assembly of STRIPAK complexes in Hippo signaling Cell Discov. 2019; 5 :3 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 C).
To validate these findings in vivo , we expressed CFP-fused wild-type (CFP-SLMAP) or CC-domain-deleted (CFP-SLMAP ΔCC ) SLMAP protein in MDCK cells. Unlike AMOT or KIBRA, which were induced to undergo LLPS by high confluency or osmotic stress, CFP-SLMAP, but not CFP-SLMAP ΔCC , readily formed liquid-like foci consistent with biomolecular condensates in sparse culture without osmotic stress ( Figures 4 D and 4E). As in vitro , the CFP-SLMAP condensates in MDCK cells could enrich MST and SIKE ( Figure 4 F). In addition, SLMAP condensates colocalized with ER-Tracker Red, consistent with SLMAP being an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tail-anchored protein ( Byers et al., 2009 7. Byers, J.T. ∙ Guzzo, R.M. ∙ Salih, M. ... Hydrophobic profiles of the tail anchors in SLMAP dictate subcellular targeting BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10 :48 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 B). Similar SLMAP foci were confirmed in an RFP-SLMAP knockin HEK293A cell line generated by tagging RFP to the endogenous SLMAP gene ( Figures 4 G and S4 C).
To investigate the cellular function of SLMAP condensates, we compared the ability of wild-type and LLPS-deficient SLMAP variants to rescue the Hippo signaling defect in SLMAP knockout HEK293A cells. As reported before ( Bae et al., 2017 4. Bae, S.J. ∙ Ni, L. ∙ Osinski, A. ... SAV1 promotes Hippo kinase activation through antagonizing the PP2A phosphatase STRIPAK eLife. 2017; 6 e30278. Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2017 65. Zheng, Y. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Wang, L. ... Homeostatic control of Hpo/MST kinase activity through autophosphorylation-dependent recruitment of the STRIPAK PP2A phosphatase complex Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3612-3623 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), SLMAP knockout cells showed increased MST activity as revealed by elevated phosphorylation of the MST substrate MOB ( Figure 4 H). This defect was rescued by wild-type CFP-SLMAP but not the LLPS-deficient mutant CFP-SLMAP ΔCC ( Figure 4 H), supporting a role for SLMAP condensates in facilitating MST inactivation. Together with the ability of SLMAP condensates to enrich MST and SIKE, we suggest that SLMAP forms biomolecular condensates at steady state to concentrate MST for inactivation by the STRIPAK phosphatase complex.
The ability of upstream activators (AMOT and KIBRA) and inhibitor (SLMAP) of the Hippo pathway to form biomolecular condensates led us to investigate the relationship between these condensates. Interestingly, besides binding AMOT, KIBRA has also been reported to bind SLMAP ( Chen et al., 2019 10. Chen, R. ∙ Xie, R. ∙ Meng, Z. ... STRIPAK integrates upstream signals to initiate the Hippo kinase cascade Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :1565-1577 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed endogenous KIBRA-SLMAP interaction in HEK293A cells ( Figure S5 A) and found that this interaction requires the CC domains of each protein ( Figures S5 B and S5 C). We, therefore, wondered whether SLMAP, like AMOT, could form bi-scaffold condensates with KIBRA. Unexpectedly, purified YFP-KIBRA and CFP-SLMAP proteins did not co-phase separate into a single phase but rather formed adjoining but immiscible biphasic condensates ( Figure 5 A). The morphology of the in vitro biphasic condensates varied with the relative ratio of KIBRA to SLMAP in reconstitution, forming multilayered biphasic condensates containing a KIBRA core and an SLMAP shell at equal molar ratio, and immediately adjacent phases side-by-side at 1:3 KIBRA to SLMAP ratio ( Figure 5 A).
Next, we asked whether the AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates, like the KIBRA condensates, also form an immiscible phase adjoining the SLMAP condensates. Interestingly, the addition of purified recombinant AMOT protein to the in vitro reconstitution system resulted in the coalescence of KIBRA and SLMAP proteins into a single phase in an AMOT concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 5 B). Furthermore, in vitro preformed AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates coalesced with preformed SLMAP condensates to form a single phase containing all three proteins ( Figure 5 C). Thus, AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates can coalesce with SLMAP condensates to form AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates in vitro .
To understand the molecular basis underlying the formation of biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates and their coalescence into a single phase induced by AMOT, we examined protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among these proteins. As expected, homotypic KIBRA-KIBRA or SLMAP-SLMAP interactions were mediated by each protein’s CC domains ( Figures S5 D and S5E), consistent with the essential role of CC domains in condensate formation. Because heterotypic KIBRA-SLMAP interactions were also mediated by each protein’s CC domains ( Figures S5 B and S5C), we hypothesized that the organization of KIBRA and SLMAP into biphasic condensates may be simply explained by stronger homotypic KIBRA-KIBRA or SLMAP-SLMAP than heterotypic KIBRA-SLMAP interactions. Indeed, under identical conditions, homotypic KIBRA-KIBRA or SLMAP-SLMAP interactions were much stronger than the heterotypic KIBRA-SLMAP interactions ( Figures 5 D and 5E).
If differential strengths of PPIs drive KIBRA and SLMAP into biphasic condensates, how does AMOT promote the coalescence of KIBRA and SLMAP into a single phase? Interestingly, we found that AMOT enhanced KIBRA-SLMAP interactions in an AMOT-concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 5 F), suggesting that AMOT may promote the coalescence of KIBRA and SLMAP into a single phase by enhancing heterotypic KIBRA-SLMAP interactions ( Figure 5 G).
Next, we asked whether the AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates can be induced in cells by Hippo-activating signals. We first examined osmotic stress by subjecting cells to different lengths of sorbitol treatment. As shown earlier in this study, we detected SLMAP condensates, but not KIBRA or AMOT condensates, in sparse MDCK cells without osmotic stress ( Figure 6 A). 30 min of osmotic-stress-induced the formation of numerous KIBRA condensates, most of which were directly adjacent to SLMAP condensates ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). Such configuration is consistent with the ability of purified KIBRA and SLMAP to form biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates in vitro at 1:3 molar ratio ( Figure 5 A). AMOT condensates were hardly detectable at this time point. Interestingly, after 90 min of osmotic stress, we detected condensates triple-positive for KIBRA, SLMAP, and AMOT ( Figure 6 A), consistent with the formation of tri-scaffold condensates. Thus, the temporal progression of phase separation in response to osmotic stress, from SLMAP condensates to biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates and lastly AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates, is consistent with in vitro reconstitution analysis. The temporal progression of phase separation was further confirmed by time-lapse live cell imaging ( Figure S6 B) and immunostaining of epitope-tagged HA-AMOT, FLAG-KIBRA, and V5-SLMAP ( Figure S6 C). The tri-scaffold condensates were localized to ER membrane as confirmed by ER-Tracker Red staining ( Figure S6 D). Besides osmotic stress, high confluency also induced the formation of AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates in MDCK cells ( Figure 6 B), suggesting that they can be induced by distinct Hippo-activating signals.
Given our in vitro analysis implicating AMOT in promoting the coalescence of KIBRA and SLMAP condensates into a single phase ( Figure 5 B), we compared wild-type and AMOT knockout HEK293 cells. As in MDCK cells, 30 min of osmotic stress in wild-type HEK293 cells induced the formation of biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates, whereas AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates were only detectable after 90 min of osmotic stress ( Figure S6 E). Accompanying the temporal progression of osmotic-stress-induced phase separation, YAP phosphorylation was elevated after 30 min and further increased after 90 min of osmotic stress ( Figure 6 C). In AMOT knockout HEK293 cells, 30 min of osmotic-stress-induced the formation of biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates as in wild-type cells. However, unlike wild-type cells, KIBRA and SLMAP remained as biphasic condensates without merging into a single phase in AMOT knockout HEK293 cells after 90 min of osmotic stress ( Figure S6 E). Correlating with these cellular phenotypes, osmotic-stress-induced YAP phosphorylation remained at similar levels between 30 and 90 min of osmotic stress in AMOT knockout cells ( Figure 6 C). As expected, expression of wild-type AMOT, but not AMOT-mutant defective in the KIBRA-binding PY motifs (AMOT mPY ), rescued the formation of tri-scaffold condensates induced by 90 min of osmotic stress ( Figure 6 D, quantified in Figure S6 F), as well as the defective YAP subcellular localization in response to high confluency ( Figure 6 E), in AMOT knockout cells. Likewise, expression of wild-type KIBRA, but not a mutant lacking its WW domains (KIBRA ΔWW ), rescued the formation of tri-scaffold condensates in KIBRA knockout HEK293A cells ( Figure S6 G). Together, these findings implicate AMOT-dependent tri-scaffold condensates in enhancing Hippo pathway activation.
Next, we examined how components of Hippo pathway core kinase cascade are partitioned into the biphasic or tri-scaffold condensates. In the reconstituted biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates, the MST/SAV complex was enriched in the SLMAP phase ( Figure 7 A), whereas the LATS/MOB complex was enriched in the KIBRA phase ( Figures 7 B and S7 A). YAP was not enriched in any of the two adjoining phases ( Figures 7 C and S7 B), consistent with the absence of YAP-binding PPxY motifs in SLMAP or KIBRA. In contrast, the reconstituted AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates enriched MST/SAV, LATS/MOB, or YAP as expected ( Figures 7 A–7C, S7 A, and S7B).
We observed similar partitioning of kinase cascade components in vivo , by taking advantage of the osmotic-stress-induced progression from biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates (30 min) to AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates (90 min) in MDCK cells. Without osmotic stress, MST was enriched in SLMAP condensates ( Figure 7 D), whereas LATS and YAP were diffusely distributed ( Figures S7 C and S7D). In biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates (induced by 30 min osmotic stress), MST was enriched in the SLMAP phase ( Figure 7 D), LATS was enriched in the KIBRA phase ( Figure S7 C), and YAP was not enriched in either phase ( Figure S7 D). In contrast, the tri-scaffold condensates (induced after 90 min osmotic stress) enriched MST, LATS, and YAP ( Figures 7 D, S7 C, and S7D). Besides these core kinase cascade components, the tri-scaffold condensates could also enrich PTPN14 or NF2, another two major upstream activators of the Hippo pathway ( Figure S7 E), implicating a general role for the tri-scaffold condensates in organizing Hippo pathway activation.
Because KIBRA was reported to inhibit STRIPAK activity ( Chen et al., 2019 10. Chen, R. ∙ Xie, R. ∙ Meng, Z. ... STRIPAK integrates upstream signals to initiate the Hippo kinase cascade Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :1565-1577 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), we investigated how KIBRA may mediate this function in the tri-scaffold condensates. The Hippo-inhibitory function of SLMAP requires its simultaneous and direct binding to both MST and SIKE, an adaptor protein that bridges SLMAP to the rest of the STRIPAK complex ( Jeong et al., 2021 28. Jeong, B.C. ∙ Bae, S.J. ∙ Ni, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of the Hippo signaling integrator human STRIPAK Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2021; 28 :290-299 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tang et al., 2019 51. Tang, Y. ∙ Chen, M. ∙ Zhou, L. ... Architecture, substructures, and dynamic assembly of STRIPAK complexes in Hippo signaling Cell Discov. 2019; 5 :3 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because MST was enriched in both SLMAP condensates and AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates, KIBRA does not appear to affect SLMAP-MST interactions. We, therefore, examined whether KIBRA can inhibit SLMAP-SIKE interactions, especially given that both KIBRA ( Figures S5 B and S5C) and SIKE ( Jeong et al., 2021 28. Jeong, B.C. ∙ Bae, S.J. ∙ Ni, L. ... Cryo-EM structure of the Hippo signaling integrator human STRIPAK Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2021; 28 :290-299 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tang et al., 2019 51. Tang, Y. ∙ Chen, M. ∙ Zhou, L. ... Architecture, substructures, and dynamic assembly of STRIPAK complexes in Hippo signaling Cell Discov. 2019; 5 :3 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) bind to the CC domains of SLMAP. Consistent with this possibility, increasing amount of KIBRA suppressed the interactions between SIKE and SLMAP ( Figure S7 F), suggesting that KIBRA and SIKE bind to SLMAP in a competitive manner.
The competition between KIBRA and SIKE for SLMAP binding suggests that the formation of AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates may inactivate SLMAP function by excluding SIKE from the condensates. To test this possibility, we in-vitro -reconstituted biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates or AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates in the presence of SIKE. Indeed, although SIKE was selectively enriched in the SLMAP phase in biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates, SIKE was always excluded from the AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates ( Figures 7 E and S7 G).
We next extended these results in vivo by taking advantage of the osmotic-stress-induced temporal progression of phase separation in MDCK cells. SIKE was enriched in the SLMAP phase without osmotic stress or after 30 min of osmotic stress, when KIBRA and SLMAP formed biphasic condensates ( Figure 7 F). After 90 min of osmotic stress, when tri-scaffold condensates were induced, SIKE was markedly diminished in the tri-scaffold condensates compared with the earlier SLMAP condensates ( Figure 7 F). These findings are entirely consistent with the partitioning of SIKE between these condensates in vitro . Taken together, we suggest that besides enriching positive components to facilitate pathway activation, the AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates further inactivate a key negative upstream regulator (SLMAP) by excluding its essential binding partner (SIKE) from the condensates ( Figure 7 G).

Section: Discussion

How Hippo signaling integrates diverse regulatory inputs remains poorly understood. Our current study implicates biomolecular condensates formed by Hippo pathway upstream regulators as a simple mechanism of pathway regulation by distinct signals. We show that positive regulators AMOT and KIBRA undergo LLPS to form Hippo-activating condensates in response to cell contact inhibition or osmotic stress. The Hippo-activating condensates further coalesce with the adjoining Hippo-inactivating SLMAP condensates into Hippo-activating AMOT/KIBRA/SLMAP tri-scaffold condensates, in which all components of the core kinase cascade are enriched and SLMAP is inactivated due to KIBRA-mediated competitive exclusion of its essential binding partner SIKE from the condensates. These results provide mechanistic insights into upstream regulation of Hippo signaling, multiphase organization, and regulation of the activities of biomolecular condensates.
AMOT and KIBRA are two well-established regulators acting immediately upstream of the core Hippo kinase cascade. These proteins are considered traditional scaffold proteins based on their interactions with multiple Hippo pathway components. AMOT has been shown to interact with LATS ( Adler et al., 2013 1.

Kibra functions as a tumor suppressor protein that regulates Hippo signaling in conjunction with Merlin and Expanded Dev. Cell. 2010; 18 :288-299 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Traditional scaffold proteins rely on a simple tethering mechanism to increase the reaction rate between weakly interacting molecules ( Good et al., 2011 21. Good, M.C. ∙ Zalatan, J.G. ∙ Lim, W.A. Scaffold proteins: hubs for controlling the flow of cellular information Science. 2011; 332 :680-686 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, excess amount of traditional scaffold proteins often disturbs stoichiometric balance and leads to combinatorial inhibition, which is similar to the immunologic phenomenon “the prozone effect” (also called “the hook effect”) ( Chapman and Asthagiri, 2009 9.

In contrast, AMOT or KIBRA overexpression activates rather than inhibits Hippo signaling ( Yu et al., 2010 60. Yu, J. ∙ Zheng, Y. ∙ Dong, J. ...

Angiomotin is a novel Hippo pathway component that inhibits YAP oncoprotein Genes Dev. 2011; 25 :51-63 Crossref Scopus (543) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that they promote Hippo pathway activation by a mechanism distinct from that of traditional scaffold proteins. Our current study reveals that AMOT and KIBRA facilitates Hippo pathway activation by forming biomolecular condensates. In vitro reconstitution demonstrates that AMOT, KIBRA, or AMOT/KIBRA condensates could all concentrate MST/SAV and LATS/MOB complexes, and additionally, AMOT or AMOT/KIBRA condensates could also enrich YAP. Given the intrinsic ability of MST to autoactivate itself by trans autophophorylation ( Bae et al., 2017 4. Bae, S.J. ∙ Ni, L. ∙ Osinski, A. ... SAV1 promotes Hippo kinase activation through antagonizing the PP2A phosphatase STRIPAK eLife. 2017; 6 e30278. Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ), these condensates are predicted to provide a cellular hub for active Hippo signaling. In addition to acting as signaling hubs, these condensates may also serve as physical anchors that directly sequester YAP in the cytosol. Because phase separation is thermodynamically promoted by protein concentration, our model provides a plausible explanation for the lack of combinatorial inhibition under conditions of AMOT or KIBRA overexpression. Besides AMOT and KIBRA, other scaffold proteins such as PSD-95 of postsynaptic densities ( Zeng et al., 2016 61. Zeng, M. ∙ Shang, Y. ∙ Araki, Y. ... Phase transition in postsynaptic densities underlies formation of synaptic complexes and synaptic plasticity Cell. 2016; 166 :1163-1175.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ) and LAT of T cell receptor signaling ( Su et al., 2016 50. Su, X. ∙ Ditlev, J.A. ∙ Hui, E. ... Phase separation of signaling molecules promotes T cell receptor signal transduction Science. 2016; 352 :595-599 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ) also undergo phase separation. Whether organizing cellular information flow in the form of biomolecular condensates is a common theme among traditional scaffold proteins is worth further investigation.
The formation of biomolecular condensates also provides a plausible explanation for another peculiar feature of the Hippo pathway, the functional redundancy among its many upstream activators. For example, unlike the core components of Hippo kinase cascade, loss-of-function mutations in any single upstream activator cause only weak or no visible tissue overgrowth in Drosophila , and combinatorial inactivation of multiple upstream activators are often required to produce tissue overgrowth more closely resembling loss-of-function mutations in the core kinase cascade ( Baumgartner et al., 2010 6.

Kibra functions as a tumor suppressor protein that regulates Hippo signaling in conjunction with Merlin and Expanded Dev. Cell. 2010; 18 :288-299 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ability of upstream regulators to independently form condensates capable of enriching all components of the core kinase cascade provides a molecular explanation for such functional redundancy.
The upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway are thought to mediate diverse inputs into the core kinase cascade by poorly understood mechanisms ( Davis and Tapon, 2019 13. Davis, J.R. ∙ Tapon, N.

Our study implicates the formation of biomolecular condensates by upstream regulators as a unifying theme to integrate distinct activation signals such as cell-cell contact and osmotic stress. We note that a number of earlier reports have documented cytoplasmic puncta containing AMOT ( Chan et al., 2013 8. Chan, S.W. ∙ Lim, C.J. ∙ Guo, F. ...

Regulation of AMPA receptor function by the human memory-associated gene KIBRA Neuron. 2011; 71 :1022-1029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although they were not identified as biomolecular condensates in previous studies, their widespread occurrence in many different cellular contexts, together with the exquisite sensitivity of biomolecular condensates to diverse factors such as protein concentration, posttranslational modification, temperature, pH, redox, and salt concentration ( Banani et al., 2017 5. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Crossref Scopus (3254) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 47. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2168) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggest that the formation of biomolecular condensates by upstream regulators may provide a common conduit to integrate diverse physiological inputs beyond cell-cell contact and osmotic stress.
Besides elucidating upstream regulation of Hippo signaling, our findings also shed light on multiphasic biomolecular condensate organization. Using stress granules and P-bodies as models, Sanders et al. showed that competing molecular interactions control multiphase condensate organization ( Sanders et al., 2020 45. Sanders, D.W. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Lee, D.S.W. ... Competing protein-RNA interaction networks control multiphase intracellular organization Cell. 2020; 181 :306-324.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). The presence of bridges, which are molecules with 2 valences connecting two scaffolds but not able to phase separate per se, induces the wetting of two types of condensates to form biphasic condensates ( Sanders et al., 2020 45. Sanders, D.W. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Lee, D.S.W. ... Competing protein-RNA interaction networks control multiphase intracellular organization Cell. 2020; 181 :306-324.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our characterization of the biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates demonstrates that multiphase condensates can also be formed without bridge molecules. We further propose that the formation of multiphase condensates may be explained by differential strengths of competing PPIs ( Figure 5 G) according to the molecular network model of LLPS ( Sanders et al., 2020 45. Sanders, D.W. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Lee, D.S.W. ... Competing protein-RNA interaction networks control multiphase intracellular organization Cell. 2020; 181 :306-324.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). If the heterotypic interaction between two types of scaffolds does not compete with homotypic scaffold interactions that mediate phase separation, this type of heterotypic interaction should not interfere with each scaffold’s phase separation. These scaffolds can be considered as client of each other and would coalesce into one phase, as in the case of AMOT/KIBRA bi-scaffold condensates. However, if the heterotypic interaction between two types of scaffolds competes with homotypic interactions that mediate phase separation, the heterotypic scaffold interaction may interfere with each scaffold’s phase separation, with the outcome of this interference determined by relative PPI strengths. If homotypic scaffold interactions are sufficiently stronger than heterotypic scaffold interaction, scaffolds tend to self-associate into condensates and, thus, create immiscibility. Only scaffold molecules localized to the edges of the condensates can expose some interaction sites to bring the two phases together to form biphasic condensates, as in the case of biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates.
Differential strengths of PPIs may also explain how AMOT promotes the coalescence of the biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates into a single phase. For example, AMOT may promote CC-mediated heterotypic interactions between KIBRA and SLMAP such that the heterotypic scaffold interaction becomes comparable or even stronger than homotypic interactions, which would lead to phase coalescence according to the molecular network model of LLPS ( Sanders et al., 2020 45. Sanders, D.W. ∙ Kedersha, N. ∙ Lee, D.S.W. ... Competing protein-RNA interaction networks control multiphase intracellular organization Cell. 2020; 181 :306-324.e28 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, the interactions between AMOT and KIBRA may create de novo binding sites for SLMAP that promote phase coalescence in a CC-independent manner. Further studies are required to distinguish between these possibilities.
Another insight from our study concerns the regulation of biomolecular condensate activities. A canonical function of biomolecular condensates is to enhance biochemical reactions by concentrating enzymes and substrates or excluding inhibitors ( Banani et al., 2017 5. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :285-298 Crossref Scopus (3254) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 47. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2168) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the question of how the activities of biomolecular condensates can be regulated on demand. Although condensate dissolution provides an intuitive way to counteract biomolecular condensates, our characterization of SLMAP condensates suggests an alternative way to inhibit biomolecular condensates without condensate dissolution, via multiphase coalescence that brings an SLMAP inhibitor (KIBRA) from another condensate into the SLMAP condensate ( Figure 7 H). Interestingly, a disease-causing mutation (E198K) in the exonuclease TREX1 promotes TREX1 condensate formation and its coalescence with cGAS-DNA condensates ( Zhou et al., 2021 67. Zhou, W. ∙ Mohr, L. ∙ Maciejowski, J. ... cGAS phase separation inhibits TREX1-mediated DNA degradation and enhances cytosolic DNA sensing Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 :739-755.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the translation regulators FMRP and CAPRIN1 can form biphasic or bi-scaffold condensates depending on each protein’s phosphorylation status ( Kim et al., 2019 32. Kim, T.H. ∙ Tsang, B. ∙ Vernon, R.M. ... Phospho-dependent phase separation of FMRP and CAPRIN1 recapitulates regulation of translation and deadenylation Science. 2019; 365 :825-829 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that multiphase coalescence may represent a general mechanism mediating the entry of normally excluded factors into biomolecular condensates.
Our study has focused on cell-cell contact and osmotic stress, whether other signals (such as mechanic force) also affect the phase separation of AMOT and KIBRA, or other upstream regulators, remains to be established. Second, our model that differential strengths of competing PPI underlie the biphasic KIBRA-SLMAP condensates and their coalescence into a single phase by AMOT was based on qualitative assays. Quantitative measurement of the binding affinities of PPI will be required to further corroborate this model. Third, our study has focused on how phase separation of Hippo pathway regulators contributes to “normal” Hippo signaling. Whether aberrant phase separation of these regulators contributes to the dysregulated Hippo signaling in human diseases remains to be determined.

DNA fragments encoding proteins of interest were amplified by PCR with Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix. The amplified DNA fragments were purified and cloned into pET28a vector (NdeI/XhoI sites) or pCDH-CMV vector (EcoRI/NotI sites) using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix. The pRSFDuet vector-based plasmids were generated by a two-step assembly. First, SAV was inserted into the BamHI/NotI sites to generate pRSFDuet-6×His-SAV and RFP-LATS into the EcoRI/NotI sites to generate pRSFDuet-6×His-RFP-LATS of pRSFDuet. Then RFP-MST was inserted into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pRSFDuet-6×His-SAV to generate pRSFDuet-6×His-SAV/RFP-MST and MOB into the Ndel/XhoI sites of pRSFDuet-6×His-RFP-LATS to generate pRSFDuet-6×His-RFP-LATS/MOB. Inserted sequences were further validated by Sanger sequencing.

Protein expression in Escherichia coli ( E.coli ) BL21(DE3) cells was induced by 200 μM IPTG (OD 600 =0.8) for 18 h at 16 °C. Collected bacteria were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors, followed by a centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA agarose for 2 h, then was washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Finally, proteins were eluted by discontinuous gradient buffers (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mM, 100 mM or 200 mM imidazole. Proteins eluted by 100 mM imidazole were collected and concentrated with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (Sigma) and then desalted with Disposable PD 10 Desalting Columns (GE Healthcare) against stocking buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Purity of protein was examined by Coomassie blue staining and concentrations of protein were determined by Bradford protein assay.
Full-length human AMOT, KIBRA and SLMAP were poorly expressed in E.coli . To increase their expression levels, amino acid residues 773-1084 (C-terminus) of AMOT, 841-1119 (C-terminal non-structural region) of KIBRA, 801-828 (C-terminal transmembrane region) of SLMAP and 858-1288 (C-terminal non-structural region) of Drosophila Kibra were removed in plasmid construction. In addition, human MST and SAV were replaced by their highly conserved Drosophila orthologs Hpo and Sav, respectively, due to poor expression of human MST/SAV complex in E.coli . All these fusion proteins contain a 3× GGS flexible peptide linker between the fluorescence protein and the protein of interest. Monomeric variants of the fluorescence protein, mTurquoise2 for CFP, SYFP2 for YFP and mScarlet-i for RFP, were used to generate fluorescently tagged fusion proteins. All the purified recombinant proteins are listed in key resources table .
Purified recombinant proteins in stocking buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) were thawed at room temperature and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min to remove aggregates. LLPS was induced at room temperature by diluting proteins and NaCl to the indicated concentrations. Otherwise indicated in the figure legend, the final concentration of NaCl was 150 mM for in vitro LLPS assays. In addition, 3% PEG-8000 was supplemented to induce LLPS of SLMAP proteins. After mixing, 30 μL of the reaction solution was gently transferred onto a MatTek 35 mm glass bottom dish for live imaging using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope equipped with a 40× oil objective lens. Fluorescence intensities of biomolecular condensates were quantified by ImageJ.
FRAP analysis for in vitro or cellular biomolecular condensates was conducted at room temperature on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with a 40× oil objective lens. A defined region of ∼1 μm diameter was photobleached by the equipped laser at ∼90% power intensity. Fluorescence intensities of the region were recorded by time-lapse live imaging with a 10 s interval and further quantified by Zeiss ZEN.
Rabbit muscle G-actin was pre-polymerized to produce F-actin in actin polymerization buffer (10 mM imidazole pH 7.0, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ATP) and labeled by equimolar amounts of Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin. To visualize LLPS of AMOT in presence or absence of F-actin filaments in vitro , 0.5 μM purified CFP-AMOT or CFP-AMOT ΔAB was incubated with 1 μΜ pre-assembled F-actin for 2 h at room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mM imidazole pH 7.0, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.1 mg/mL of glucose oxidase, 15 mg/mL of glucose, 0.02 mg/mL of catalase and 0.5% methylcellulose. A volume of 20 μL reaction solution was transferred onto a slide covered with poly-L-lysine coated coverslip and imaged by a Leica TCS SP8 microscope equipped with a 63× oil objective lens. Images were analyzed by ImageJ.
siRNA for KIBRAs ( KIBRA , WWC2 , WWC3 ) and non-targeting control were purchased from Horizon Discovery and prepared at a concentration of 20 μM in nuclease-free water. 18 h before transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a confluency of ∼30%. siRNA transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s manual, a total of 2.5 μL siRNA was used for each well. After 48 hours, cells were subjected to the indicated analysis. The siRNA sequence targeting the indicated genes are listed in key resources table .
HEK293 or HEK293A cells at a confluency of ∼30% in a 6-well plate or 35 mm MatTek glass bottom dish (poly-D-lysine coated) were transfected with DNA (plasmid or PCR product) using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s manual. After 48 hours, cells were subjected to the indicated analysis.
All experiments examining condensate formation in cells involved infecting MDCK, HEK293 or HEK293A cells with lentivirus expressing the respective protein, unless otherwise indicated. To package lentivirus, HEK293T cells seeded in a 6-well plate at a confluency of ∼90% were transfected with 1.2 μg pCDH-CMV plasmid carrying the gene of interest, together with 0.5 μg envelope plasmid pMD2.G and 0.8 μg packaging plasmid psPAX2 using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s manual. Culture medium were collected 48 h post transfection and filtered through 0.45 μm sterilized Millex-HV Syringe Filters (Millipore) as lentivirus preparation. Lentivirus infection was carried out by adding lentivirus into cell culture medium supplemented with 2 μg/mL polybrene. 48 h post infection, lentivirus was removed by changing with fresh culture medium. In all experiments, lentivirus amount was titrated to achieve expression level comparable to that of endogenous proteins, as confirmed by western blotting or quantitative real-time PCR.
Cells for live imaging were seeded at a confluency of ∼40% on a 35 mm MatTek glass bottom dish (poly-D-lysine coated). Live cell imaging was carried out on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with a 40× oil objective lens. Images were analyzed using Zeiss ZEN 2012 or ImageJ.
Images for the KIBRA condensates in MDCK cells and the Kibra condensates in apical medial cortex of Drosophila wing disc cells were acquired by LSM880 confocal microscope. The condensates were randomly selected, and their maximum diameter were further measured by ImagJ using the scale bar tool.
For sparse cell culture, 0.4×10 6 (low confluency) cells were seeded on a 6-well plate or 35 mm MatTek glass bottom dish (poly-D-lysine coated) 24 h before experiment. For cell-cell contact induction, 2×10 6 (high confluency) cells were seeded instead. For osmotic stress induction, cells in sparse culture were incubated with culture medium supplemented with 0.4 M sorbitol or 200 mM NaCl.
CRISPR-Cas9 approach was used to generate HA-CFP-AMOT, FLAG-YFP-KIBRA and V5-RFP-SLMAP knockin HEK293A cell lines. gRNA sequences were designed by web tool CHOPCHOP ( https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/ ) and the oligos were annealed and ligated into lentiCRISPR v2 vector (BbsI/BbsI sites). Assembled gRNA sequences were validated by Sanger sequencing. Donors were amplified by PCR with specific primers. HEK293A cell transfection was carried out in a 6-well plate at a confluency of ∼40% with 1 μg of lentiCRISPR-gRNA plasmids and 0.5 μg of donor DNA using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s manual. Three days post transfection, cells were trypsin digested and suspended by PBS, and then sorted by flow cytometry. CFP-, YFP- or RFP-positive cells were collected into 96-well plates with one cell per well. In the next two weeks, the sorted clones were maintained and expanded by transferring into 48-well and then 12-well plates. The expanded clones were screened by western blot assay with primary antibodies against the epitope tags HA, FLAG or V5. Next, HA-CFP-AMOT, FLAG-YFP-KIBRA or V5-RFP-SLMAP knockin candidate clones were further confirmed by PCR and finally validated by Sanger sequencing. The gRNA sequence targeting the indicated genes and the primer sequence for donor amplification are listed in key resources table .
For Co-IP, cultured cells were harvested and lysed with TNTE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 45 min on ice. Cell lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C to collect supernatant. For anti-FLAG, -GFP or -HA Co-IP, the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG, -GFP or -HA antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Protein G Sepharose for another 4 h at 4 °C. For Co-IP of endogenous FLAG-YFP-KIBRA, the supernatant was incubated with IgG- or FLAG-magnetic beads overnight at 4 °C. For His-tag pull-down, the supernatant was incubated with His-tagged recombinant proteins and Ni-NTA agarose for 6 h at 4 °C. Next, beads were washed with lysis buffer and then boiled in SDS loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6% glycerol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) as samples for western blot analysis.
Samples for western blot analysis were separated on a gradient 4-12% SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% milk in TBST buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody (see key resources table ) overnight at 4 °C. After three times of 10 min wash with TBST buffer, the membrane was further incubated with secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at room temperature. After three times of 10 min wash with TBST buffer, the membrane was exposed with ECL substrate (GE Healthcare).
After removing culture medium, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and were washed with washing buffer (PBS plus 0.1% Tween-20) for three times. Samples were permeabilized with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton-X 100 for 10 min and were further incubated with blocking buffer (PBS supplemented plus 1.5% goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, samples were incubated with primary antibody (see key resources table ) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing for 10 min for three times, the samples were then incubated with secondary Alexa Flour antibody (1:500 dilution in blocking buffer) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the samples were mounted with mounting medium and stored at 4 °C before imaging.
Total RNA from cells was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s manual. 1 μg of total RNA was used for reverse-transcription using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system using iQ SYBR Green Supermix. Relative gene expression levels were normalized to the level of GAPDH . All primers are listed in key resources table .
Quantifications of fluorescence intensity and size measurement of image particles were conducted using ImageJ or Zeiss ZEN and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test and two-way ANOVA used for comparison are indicated in the figure legends. Statistical significance was considered at test level p < 0.05.
