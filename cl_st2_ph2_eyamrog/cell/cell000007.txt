Title: Local Fatty Acid Channeling into Phospholipid Synthesis Drives Phagophore Expansion during Autophagy


Abstract: Summary

Autophagy is a conserved catabolic homeostasis process central for cellular and organismal health. During autophagy, small single-membrane phagophores rapidly expand into large double-membrane autophagosomes to encapsulate diverse cargoes for degradation. It is thought that autophagic membranes are mainly derived from preformed organelle membranes. Instead, here we delineate a pathway that expands the phagophore membrane by localized phospholipid synthesis. Specifically, we find that the conserved acyl-CoA synthetase Faa1 accumulates on nucleated phagophores and locally activates fatty acids (FAs) required for phagophore elongation and autophagy. Strikingly, using isotopic FA tracing, we directly show that Faa1 channels activated FAs into the synthesis of phospholipids and promotes their assembly into autophagic membranes. Indeed, the first committed steps of de novo phospholipid synthesis at the ER, which forms stable contacts with nascent autophagosomes, are essential for autophagy. Together, our work illuminates how cells spatially tune synthesis and flux of phospholipids for autophagosome biogenesis during autophagy.

Section: Introduction

Macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, is a central catabolic process essential for cell homeostasis under basal and stress conditions with broad implications for aging and age-associated diseases ( Dikic and Elazar, 2018; Hansen et al., 2018; Leidal et al., 2018 14.

Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :1338-1348 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). A defining feature of autophagy is the de novo formation of specialized transient double-membrane organelles, termed autophagosomes, which enable cells to target an unprecedented scope of substrates for degradation ( Gatica et al., 2018 19. Gatica, D. ∙ Lahiri, V. ∙ Klionsky, D.J. Cargo recognition and degradation by selective autophagy Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :233-242 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Autophagosome biogenesis is initiated by hierarchical assembly of conserved autophagy protein machinery at phagophore assembly sites or pre-autophagosomal structures (PASs) in close association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ( Hurley and Young, 2017; Mizushima et al., 2011; Noda and Inagaki, 2015 36.

Here, precursor membranes likely comprised of tubulovesicular Atg9 compartments and COPII vesicles are fused to form a small single-membrane phagophore (or isolation membrane) ( Davis et al., 2016; Ge et al., 2013; Ge et al., 2017; Ge et al., 2014; Graef et al., 2013; Ishihara et al., 2001; Karanasios et al., 2016; Longatti et al., 2012; Mari et al., 2010; Puri et al., 2018; Shima et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2013; Yamamoto et al., 2012; Young et al., 2006; Zoppino et al., 2010 12.

Subsequently, the phagophore enters a stage of dramatic membrane expansion and, within minutes, engulfs its substrates as a large cup-shaped structure. The cargo is topologically isolated from the cytosol upon closure of the phagophore, which generates the inner and outer vesicle of the double-membrane autophagosome. The outer autophagosomal membrane fuses with lysosomes in mammals or vacuoles in yeast and plants exposing the inner vesicle and its enclosed cargo to resident hydrolases for degradation ( Abada and Elazar, 2014; Lamb et al., 2013; Wen and Klionsky, 2016 1.

It is thought that a number of organelles including the ER, Golgi, endosomes, mitochondria, plasma membrane, and lipid droplets contribute mainly preformed membranes to the formation of autophagosomes ( Axe et al., 2008; Dupont et al., 2014; Geng et al., 2010; Hailey et al., 2010; Longatti et al., 2012; Nascimbeni et al., 2017; Puri et al., 2013, 2018; Ravikumar et al., 2010; Shpilka et al., 2015; van der Vaart et al., 2010 4.

Cell. 2010; 21 :2270-2284 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it has been a major challenge to conclusively determine at which stage and to which extent these organelles may supply membranes directly to autophagosome biogenesis. In particular, the mechanisms and membrane sources assembling the vast majority of autophagic membranes during the rapid expansion of the phagophore into the large autophagosome have not been clearly defined.
The ER, in conjunction with mitochondria, is the central organelle for de novo lipid synthesis. Specified by dedicated protein tethers, the ER network forms membrane contact sites (MCSs) with virtually all other organelles ( Lahiri et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018 56.

The ER is also in close spatial and physical contact with nascent autophagosomes, an apparent universal feature of autophagy ( Axe et al., 2008; Biazik et al., 2015; Gómez-Sánchez et al., 2018; Graef et al., 2013; Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2013; Ylä-Anttila et al., 2009 4.

Similar to other membrane tethers, Atg2 mediates phospholipid transport between opposing membranes in vitro ( Maeda et al., 2019; Osawa et al., 2019; Valverde et al., 2019 62.

Kotani, T. ∙ Kirisako, H. ∙ Koizumi, M. ... The Atg2-Atg18 complex tethers pre-autophagosomal membranes to the endoplasmic reticulum for autophagosome formation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2012; 23 :896-909 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggest that phospholipid transfer across the ER-phagophore MCS may promote autophagic membrane assembly. However, if and how a net transfer of ER lipids to the phagophore is achieved in vivo and whether it may involve the de novo phospholipid synthesis activity of the ER is unknown.
One level at which cells regulate lipid fluxes is constituted by a conserved protein family of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs), which catalyzes the activation of fatty acids (FAs) by ATP hydrolysis-driven thioesterification of free FAs with coenzyme A (CoA). ACSs form complex networks composed of peripheral and transmembrane proteins (6 in yeast and 13 in mammals). Based on their dynamic and differential subcellular localization, ACSs are thought to channel activated FAs into diverse pathways including lipid synthesis, membrane editing, protein acylation, and vesicular fusion ( Black and DiRusso, 2007; Coleman, 2019; Digel et al., 2009; Grevengoed et al., 2014; Watkins et al., 2007 8.

Here, we define a pathway composed of the conserved ACS Faa1 and de novo phospholipid synthesis required for autophagy. We show that Faa1 localizes to nucleated phagophores and channels activated FAs locally into de novo phospholipid synthesis to specifically drive autophagic membrane expansion. Together, our work provides mechanistic insights into how cells rewire their phospholipid metabolism for autophagy and cellular function.

Section: Results

To test for a potential role in autophagy, we examined the ACS network in budding yeast for spatial association with autophagic membranes. We genomically modified yeast strains to coexpress C-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ACS family members Faa1, Faa3, Faa4, or Fat1 along with N-terminally red fluorescent protein (mCherry)-tagged Atg8, which is covalently attached to autophagic membranes and serves as a highly selective marker ( Duronio et al., 1992; Faergeman et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 1994a; Johnson et al., 1994b; Kirisako et al., 1999 16.

Using live-cell imaging, ACSs showed differential spatial organization in untreated cells consistent with previous data; Faa1 and Faa3 mainly localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and ER, whereas Faa4 and Fat1 were found predominantly on lipid droplets ( Figure 1 A) ( Black and DiRusso, 2007; Kohlwein et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2003 8.

Next, we induced autophagy by either inhibiting target of rapamycin complex I (TORC1) with rapamycin or nitrogen starvation (starvation). As previously described, we morphologically distinguished punctate Atg8 structures and Atg8-positive ring-like autophagosomes, which were clearly labeled by PAS and autophagosome marker Atg1 ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 A) ( Black and DiRusso, 2007; Graef et al., 2013 8.

ER exit sites are physical and functional core autophagosome biogenesis components Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24 :2918-2931 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, Faa1 and Faa4 significantly localized to Atg8 puncta and quantitatively marked autophagosomes, whereas Faa3 and Fat1 were barely detectable on any autophagic structures ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 A). These data reveal differential but redundant association of ACSs with autophagic membranes. Consistently, Faa1 and Faa4, but not Faa3 or Fat1, were degraded in an autophagy-dependent manner under these conditions similar to autophagy components Atg8 and Atg1, which bind to autophagic membranes ( Figure S1 B) ( Huang et al., 2000; Kirisako et al., 1999; Kraft et al., 2012 35.

To decipher at which stage of autophagosome biogenesis ACSs are recruited, we focused on Faa1 during rapamycin-induced autophagy. Genetic analysis revealed that Faa1 colocalization with Atg8 puncta depended on the integrity of the hierarchical assembly of the core autophagy machinery ( Figure 1 C) ( Suzuki et al., 2007 93. Suzuki, K. ∙ Kubota, Y. ∙ Sekito, T. ... Hierarchy of Atg proteins in pre-autophagosomal structure organization Genes Cells. 2007; 12 :209-218 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, we resorted to time-lapse imaging in living cells. We found that a cycle of autophagosome biogenesis, from the formation of an Atg8 punctum until vacuolar fusion, took on average 9 min ( Figures 1 D–1F), consistent with prior estimates ( Xie et al., 2008 110. Xie, Z. ∙ Nair, U. ∙ Klionsky, D.J. Atg8 controls phagophore expansion during autophagosome formation Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19 :3290-3298 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ). Faa1 became detectable around 1 min downstream of Atg8 puncta formation and progressively accumulated on autophagic membranes when both signal intensity and circumference of Atg8 puncta started to increase, consistent with the expansion of nucleated phagophores ( Figures 1 D–1F). Notably, Faa1 remained on autophagosomes, even after Atg8 signals decreased due to deconjugation from the outer autophagosomal membrane, until autophagosomes abruptly disappeared upon vacuole fusion ( Figures 1 D–1F) ( Kirisako et al., 2000 51. Kirisako, T. ∙ Ichimura, Y. ∙ Okada, H. ... The reversible modification regulates the membrane-binding state of Apg8/Aut7 essential for autophagy and the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151 :263-276 Crossref Scopus (660) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, our genetic and imaging analyses reveal that ACS Faa1 and Faa4 localize to forming autophagosomes and indicate that Faa1 recruitment to nucleated phagophores downstream of the core autophagy machinery spatiotemporally coincides with phagophore expansion.
Our observations raised the possibility of a direct function of ACSs in autophagy. In yeast, ACSs and de novo fatty acid synthesis by fatty acid synthase (FAS) constitute two parallel pathways producing activated FAs (acyl-CoA; Figure 2 A). In contrast, mammalian FAS generates free FAs that have to be activated by downstream ACSs ( Black and DiRusso, 2007; Leibundgut et al., 2008; Vance et al., 1972 8. Black, P.N. ∙ DiRusso, C.C.

Commun. 1972; 48 :649-656 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test for conserved ACS functions for autophagy in yeast, we inhibited FAS using the specific inhibitor cerulenin ( Vance et al., 1972 101. Vance, D. ∙ Goldberg, I. ∙ Mitsuhashi, O. ... Inhibition of fatty acid synthetases by the antibiotic cerulenin Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48 :649-656 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined autophagy flux by employing the established GFP-Atg8 assay, in which cleaved free GFP is a measure of the turnover of GFP-Atg8-marked autophagosomes in vacuoles ( Shintani and Klionsky, 2004 90. Shintani, T. ∙ Klionsky, D.J. Cargo proteins facilitate the formation of transport vesicles in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :29889-29894 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single ACS gene-knockout cells, Δ faa1 , Δ faa3 , Δ faa4 , or Δ fat1 , possessed wild-type (WT)-like autophagy flux independent of FAS activity, consistent with the functional redundancy suggested by autophagosomal localization of Faa1 and Faa4 ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Precluding their functional analysis, Δ faa1 Δ faa4 and Δ faa1 Δ faa3 Δ faa4 deletion cells showed markedly reduced viability during starvation and FAS-inhibition, demonstrating the essential nature of FA activation ( Figure S2 C). To overcome this limitation and to focus our analysis on Faa1, we engineered Δ faa3 Δ faa4 cells to express FAA1 ( FAA1 cells hereafter) or a FAA1 variant encoding for plasma membrane-tethered Faa1 ( PM-FAA1 cells) from the genomic FAA1 locus ( Figure 2 B). Both, FAA1 and PM-FAA1 expression fully supported cell survival upon FAS-inhibition during starvation ( Figure S2 D). As expected, GFP-tagged Faa1, but not PM-Faa1, accumulated on autophagic membranes during rapamycin-induced autophagy ( Figure 2 B). With this tool in hand, we examined the functional role of Faa1 on autophagic membranes for autophagy. Whereas FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells displayed indistinguishable autophagy responses during starvation, strikingly, PM-tethered Faa1 failed to support autophagy flux in starving cells upon FAS-inhibition when monitored by western blot or cytological analysis of vacuolar GFP-signals as a consequence of autophagy ( Figures 2 C and S2 E). Next, we measured autophagic turnover of cytosolic cargo by following vacuolar cleavage of cytosolic tandem GFP (2GFP). Similar to autophagy-deficient Δ atg7 cells, PM-FAA1 cells displayed a drastic defect in bulk autophagy compared with WT or FAA1 cells during starvation and FAS-inhibition ( Figure 2 D). Using electron microscopy, we observed that PM-FAA1 cells were strongly impaired in accumulating inner autophagosomal vesicles in hydrolase-deficient vacuoles (Δ pep4 ) in contrast to FAA1 cells after 3 h of starvation and FAS-inhibition ( Figure 2 E) ( Takeshige et al., 1992 95. Takeshige, K. ∙ Baba, M. ∙ Tsuboi, S. ... Autophagy in yeast demonstrated with proteinase-deficient mutants and conditions for its induction J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119 :301-311 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, when we lowered the glucose concentration during starvation in the absence of cerulenin, we identified metabolic conditions in which autophagy flux is predominantly dependent on Faa1, because we found significantly reduced autophagy flux in PM-FAA1 cells compared with FAA1 cells ( Figure 2 F). To exclude the possibility that these severe autophagy defects were caused by general vacuole dysfunction in PM-FAA1 cells, we tested the integrity of the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, using integral PM Mup1-GFP as an established substrate ( Menant et al., 2006 65. Menant, A. ∙ Barbey, R. ∙ Thomas, D. Substrate-mediated remodeling of methionine transport by multiple ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms in yeast cells EMBO J. 2006; 25 :4436-4447 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). WT, Δ atg7 , FAA1 , and PM-FAA1 cells showed significant vacuolar GFP-signal and conversion of Mup1-GFP to free GFP during starvation and FAS-inhibition, demonstrating that the MVB pathway and vacuolar activity were intact in these cells in contrast to MVB pathway mutant Δ vps4 ( Figure S2 F) ( Teis et al., 2008 98. Teis, D. ∙ Saksena, S. ∙ Emr, S.D. Ordered assembly of the ESCRT-III complex on endosomes is required to sequester cargo during MVB formation Dev. Cell. 2008; 15 :578-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, these data show that Faa1 fulfills critical functions for autophagy.
We asked whether ACS function in autophagy is evolutionarily conserved. High complexity of mammalian ACS systems, consisting of up to 13 protein isoforms, poses a major challenge to conclusively evaluate direct functions of individual ACSs in vivo ( Coleman, 2019; Grevengoed et al., 2014 11. Coleman, R.A. It takes a village: channeling fatty acid metabolism and triacylglycerol formation via protein interactomes J. Lipid Res. 2019; 60 :490-497 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Grevengoed, T.J. ∙ Klett, E.L. ∙ Coleman, R.A. Acyl-CoA metabolism and partitioning Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2014; 34 :1-30 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we heterologously expressed human ACS isoforms, ACSL1v5, ACSL4v1, or ACSL6v3 and -v6, predicted to form peripheral membrane proteins similar to Faa1, as plasmid-encoded C-terminally GFP- or mCherry-tagged variants in yeast. Only ACSL4v1 detectably expressed and promoted survival of Δ faa1 Δ faa3 Δ faa4 cells ( Figure S2 G). Strikingly, ACSL4v1 was specifically enriched on autophagic membranes and restored autophagy flux in Δ faa1 Δ faa3 Δ faa4 cells during starvation and FAS-inhibition ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Thus, the capacity of ACSs to localize to nascent autophagosomes and regulate autophagy is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human.
ACSs are thought to channel FA fluxes based on dynamic subcellular localization and local activity. To test this concept for autophagy, we first examined whether the catalytic activity of Faa1 on autophagic membranes was required for autophagy. Expression of plasmid-encoded mCherry-tagged FAA1 restored autophagy flux in PM-FAA1 cells during starvation and FAS-inhibition ( Figures 3 A–3C). In contrast, expression of the catalytically inactive variants, faa1 Y269A and faa1 E460A , both defective in ATP and AMP binding, or faa1 W533A , which is compromised in FA binding, did not promote autophagy flux, even though both WT and catalytically inactive Faa1 localized to autophagic membranes ( Figures 3 A–3C) ( Black and DiRusso, 2007; Black et al., 1997; Weimar et al., 2002 8. Black, P.N. ∙ DiRusso, C.C. Yeast acyl-CoA synthetases at the crossroads of fatty acid metabolism and regulation Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, these data support the notion that autophagy depends on the catalytic activity of Faa1 on autophagic membranes.
Next, we systematically probed the relevance of the spatial association of Faa1 with autophagic membranes for autophagy. In yeast, phagophores nucleate in close contact with the vacuole and specialized subregions of the ER, namely ER exit sites (ERES), at which COPII-transport vesicles form. During expansion, the phagophore adopts a defined orientation in which the rim of its cup-shaped structure is in close juxtaposition with the ER and ERES while the convex backside faces the vacuole ( Graef et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2013 26. Graef, M. ∙ Friedman, J.R. ∙ Graham, C. ... ER exit sites are physical and functional core autophagosome biogenesis components Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24 :2918-2931 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar 94. Suzuki, K. ∙ Akioka, M. ∙ Kondo-Kakuta, C. ... Fine mapping of autophagy-related proteins during autophagosome formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :2534-2544 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we generated a set of synthetic tethers to target Faa1 or, as controls, catalytically inactive Faa1 Y269A to the cytosolic surface of the vacuolar membrane (Vac-Faa1), the ER membrane at low or high expression levels (ER low - and ER high -Faa1), or ER exit sites (ERES-Faa1; Figure 3 A). All Faa1-hybrid proteins were functional and restored survival of Δ faa1 Δ faa3 Δ faa4 cells ( Figure S3 A). Hence, we tested the ability of these Faa1- or Faa1 Y269A -hybrid proteins to support autophagy flux during starvation and FAS-inhibition when expressed in PM-FAA1 cells ( Figure S3 B). Vac- and ER low -Faa1, in addition to the PM, barely improved autophagy, although autophagic structures formed in proximity to these Faa1-labeled membranes ( Figures 3 D and 3E). Remarkably, ER high -Faa1 or ERES-Faa1 led to a strong Faa1-signal next to forming autophagosomes and to a partial and significant rescue of autophagy flux ( Figures 3 D and 3E). In combination, these data indicate that autophagy requires sufficient Faa1 activity at or proximal to forming autophagosomes and support the concept that local FA channeling drives autophagy.
Our data indicate that Faa1-mediated FA channeling on autophagic membranes is critical for autophagy. To define the molecular function of Faa1 in autophagy, we first examined whether local FA activation was required for the hierarchical assembly and function of core autophagy components. Autophagy is initiated by the activation and PAS-localization of the Atg1 kinase complex ( Suzuki et al., 2007 93. Suzuki, K. ∙ Kubota, Y. ∙ Sekito, T. ... Hierarchy of Atg proteins in pre-autophagosomal structure organization Genes Cells. 2007; 12 :209-218 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar ). TORC1-depedent phosphorylation of the Atg1 kinase complex subunit Atg13 or colocalization of Atg1 kinase complex subunits Atg1 and Atg17 with Atg8 puncta was not or only slightly affected in PM-FAA1 cells compared with FAA1 cells during starvation and FAS-inhibition, respectively ( Figures S4 A and S4D) ( Kabeya et al., 2005; Kamada et al., 2000, 2010; Papinski and Kraft, 2016; Scott et al., 2000 42.

Chem. 2000; 275 :25840-25849 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that autophagy initiation occurred normally in PM-FAA1 cells. Additionally, in both FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells, autophagic membranes formed in spatial association with ERES, marked by the COPII-subunit Sec13, or colocalized with Atg9 vesicles ( Figures S4 B and S4C) ( Graef et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2013 26. Graef, M. ∙ Friedman, J.R. ∙ Graham, C. ... ER exit sites are physical and functional core autophagosome biogenesis components Mol. Biol.

Fine mapping of autophagy-related proteins during autophagosome formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :2534-2544 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that phagophores were nucleated in an Faa1-independent manner. Of note, we did not detect any differences in the total number of ERES or Atg9 puncta between FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells ( Figures S4 B and S4C), excluding general alterations in the secretory pathway as plausible cause for autophagy defects in PM-FAA1 cells. Interestingly, autophagy-specific phosphatidylinositol(PI)(3)-kinase complex I subunit, Atg14, and the PI(3)P-binding PROPPIN, Atg18, displayed mildly reduced colocalization (by ∼30%) with Atg8 puncta in PM-FAA1 cells during starvation and FAS-inhibition compared with FAA1 cells ( Figure S4 D) ( Guan et al., 2001; Kametaka et al., 1998 29.

Nevertheless, Atg2, which physically and functionally interacts with Atg18, and the downstream Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 complex subunits Atg5 and Atg12, showed only a slight or no reduction in their colocalization with Atg8 puncta, respectively ( Figure S4 D) ( Mizushima et al., 1998; Obara et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2001 66.

Chem. 2001; 276 :30442-30451 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the observed changes for Atg14 and Atg18 did not affect downstream autophagy machinery. Furthermore, all tested components of the autophagy machinery associated indistinguishably with autophagosomes in FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells ( Figure S4 D). Taken together, these data indicate that the core autophagy machinery operates largely in a Faa1-independent manner. We concluded that Faa1 functions at a stage of autophagosome biogenesis that is downstream of the assembly of the autophagy machinery and phagophore nucleation.
Given that the autophagy machinery was only minimally affected in PM-FAA1 cells, we reasoned that phagophore-bound Faa1 may function directly in autophagosome biogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the behavior of 2GFP-Atg8-marked autophagic structures in FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells with fluorescence microscopy. Fixed time point analysis suggested that PM-FAA1 cells were capable of forming autophagosomes, albeit at a slightly lower steady-state level and reduced size compared with FAA1 cells after 3 h of starvation and FAS-inhibition ( Figures S5 A–S5C), despite the severe autophagy defects under this condition. Thus, to accurately assess the dynamic nature of autophagosome biogenesis, we monitored autophagic structures in FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells by time-lapse imaging during starvation and FAS-inhibition. In FAA1 cells, we observed multiple, often simultaneous events of autophagosome formation (∼3 events/cell/30 min): newly formed punctate Atg8-structures expanded in circumference or, occasionally, in a rod-shaped manner and formed ring-like autophagosomes, which disappeared after a few minutes due to Atg8 deconjugation and vacuole fusion (arrowheads, Figure 4 A). Strikingly, in PM-FAA1 cells, we detected several Atg8-puncta (∼3 events/cell/30 min), which vanished quickly without displaying membrane expansion comparable to FAA1 cells (arrows; Figure 4 A). In addition, the rate of formation of ring-like autophagosomes was significantly reduced in PM-FAA1 cells (1 event/cell/30 min; Figure 4 A). These data indicated that nucleated phagophores often failed to expand and only seldomly formed autophagosomes in the absence of local FA activation. To explore whether detectable ring-like autophagosomes that did form in PM-FAA1 cells were also affected, we measured the duration of only completed events of autophagosome biogenesis. Autophagic membranes are marked by Faa1 past Atg8 deconjugation independently of its catalytic activity ( Figures 1 D and 3 B) and, thus, in combination with Atg8, allowed us to trace the complete process of autophagosome formation. Time-lapse analysis comparing PM-FAA1 cells coexpressing 2GFP-ATG8 and plasmid-encoded FAA1- or catalytically inactive faa1 Y269A -mCherry revealed a significant increase in the time it took for punctate structures to evolve into ring-like autophagosome in the absence of local FA activation; both the time period of Faa1- and Atg8-positive membranes (9.2 ± 0.1 versus 20.3 ± 1.9 min, yellow) and of predominantly Faa1-positive autophagosomes after Atg8 deconjugation (0.4 ± 0.02 versus 3.4 ± 1.0 min, red) were significantly extended in faa1 Y269A -expressing cells ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Thus, impaired local FA activation by Faa1 significantly delayed the biogenesis of detectable ring-like autophagosomes. Of note, the slow forming autophagosomes in PM-FAA1 cells rarely fused with the vacuole, or at least not in a productive manner, given we barely detected any inner autophagosomal vesicles in the lumen of Δ pep4 by electron or fluorescence microscopy after starvation and FAS-inhibition ( Figures 2 E and S5 D) ( Takeshige et al., 1992 95. Takeshige, K. ∙ Baba, M. ∙ Tsuboi, S. ... Autophagy in yeast demonstrated with proteinase-deficient mutants and conditions for its induction J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119 :301-311 Crossref Scopus (816) PubMed Google Scholar ). In summary, these data indicate a critical role for local FA activation by Faa1 for efficient expansion of nucleated phagophores and autophagosome biogenesis.
To directly measure the dynamic behavior of phagophores in dependence of local Faa1 activity, we followed autophagic membranes by time-lapse imaging upon inducible overexpression of selective autophagy cargo, blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-tagged prApe1 ( Suzuki et al., 2013 94. Suzuki, K. ∙ Akioka, M. ∙ Kondo-Kakuta, C. ... Fine mapping of autophagy-related proteins during autophagosome formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :2534-2544 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). In FAA1 cells, phagophores nucleated as punctate Atg8 structures and then expanded laterally, forming spherical caps on the surface of giant prApe1 oligomers during starvation and FAS-inhibition. Phagophores reached a maximal size at which they only partially encapsulated the cargo and Atg8 signals declined ( Figure 5 A), indicating a limit to phagophore growth consistent with previous data ( Suzuki et al., 2013 94. Suzuki, K. ∙ Akioka, M. ∙ Kondo-Kakuta, C. ... Fine mapping of autophagy-related proteins during autophagosome formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :2534-2544 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, this assay enabled us to clearly distinguish phagophore nucleation (puncta) and expansion (spherical caps) morphologically and to assess key parameters of phagophore dynamics quantitatively. Consistent with intact phagophore nucleation, we detected the same number of phagophores at giant prApe1 oligomers in FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells, on average 1.5 ± 0.04 and 1.5 ± 0.3 Atg8 structures, respectively, during the time frame of the experiment. For FAA1 cells, we determined that punctate phagophores expanded with a frequency of over 80% and a growth rate of ∼0.4 μm 2 /min up to a maximal size of ∼5.3 μm 2 ( Figures 5 A–5D). However, in PM-FAA1 cells, the expansion frequency was significantly reduced to ∼44%, and a majority of phagophores remained in a punctate state without discernable lateral growth over time ( Figures 5 A and 5B), confirming the expansion defects we observed without prApe1 overexpression ( Figure 4 A). Phagophores that did expand grew at a significantly lower rate of ∼0.2 μm 2 /min and to a smaller maximal size of ∼4.0 μm 2 on average in PM-FAA1 cells compared with expanding phagophores in FAA1 cells ( Figures 5 C and 5D), suggesting that the delayed formation of ring-like autophagosomes described in Figure 4 B is caused by slowed membrane growth. Thus, these data clearly show that Faa1-mediated FA channeling functions downstream of phagophore nucleation and is specifically required for the efficient expansion of the phagophore.
We asked whether FA partitioning by Faa1 constituted a rate-limiting step for phagophore dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we supplemented growth and starvation media with oleate (C18:1) to increase the available FA pool in starving cells. Interestingly, we observed significantly increased autophagy flux in FAA1 cells in the presence of oleate during starvation and FAS-inhibition ( Figure 5 E), consistent with previous data in mammalian cells ( Dupont et al., 2014 15. Dupont, N. ∙ Chauhan, S. ∙ Arko-Mensah, J. ... Neutral lipid stores and lipase PNPLA5 contribute to autophagosome biogenesis Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :609-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, added FAs promoted autophagy flux in a strictly Faa1-dependent manner, because PM-FAA1 cells where unaffected by oleate supplementation ( Figure 5 E). When we monitored phagophore dynamics on giant prApe1 oligomers, we found that the addition of oleate increased the number of phagophores in the same manner in FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells, 2.0 ± 0.2 and 1.9 ± 0.2, respectively, suggesting that phagophore nucleation occurs in a generally Faa1-independent manner. Interestingly, the absolute and relative frequency of phagophore expansion significantly increased in FAA1 cells but remained low in PM-FAA1 cells in the presence of oleate ( Figures 5 A and 5B), indicating that the transitioning of phagophores into expansion is determined by Faa1-mediated local FA activation. Importantly, while the maximal phagophore size in FAA1 or PM-FAA1 cells did not significantly change ( Figure 5 D), oleate supplementation accelerated the growth of phagophore membranes specifically in FAA1 cells to a significantly higher rate (∼0.6 μm 2 /min) compared with PM-FAA1 cells (∼0.3 μm 2 /min; Figures 5 A and 5C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Faa1-mediated FA channeling regulates the propensity of phagophores to transition into expansion and determines the growth rate of autophagic membranes in a rate-limiting manner during phagophore expansion.
To uncover the mechanistic underpinnings of Faa1-regulated phagophore dynamics, we explored the phospholipid composition of cellular and autophagic membranes. Using mass spectrometry, we first analyzed the phospholipidome of whole FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells. Interestingly, we observed that cells substantial remodeled the phospholipid headgroup and FA composition after exposure to starvation and FAS inhibition ( Figures 6 A and 6B). For example, starving cells strongly increased the relative PI content from 12% in log-phase to 46% during starvation, while there was a simultaneous decrease in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) levels ( Figures 6 A and 6B). In parallel, cellular FA profiles of phospholipids shifted toward a higher content of unsaturated and longer FAs in starving cells ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Importantly, the remodeling of the cellular phospholipidome occurred in both FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells in a similar manner during starvation ( Figures 6 A and 6B), indicating that global alterations in the cellular phospholipid composition are unlikely to cause the autophagy defects of PM-FAA1 cells.
Next, we focused our efforts on analyzing the phospholipid composition of autophagic membranes. The lipid composition of autophagosomes has been undefined. Thus, we established a method to coimmunoprecipitate autophagic membranes covalently bound to 2GFP-Atg8 (referred to as Atg8 membranes) from FAA1 cells and, as controls, from FAA1 cells that were either deficient in vacuolar fusion (Δ ypt7 ) or Atg8 lipidation (Δ atg7 ) ( Figures S6 A and S6B) ( Haas et al., 1995; Huang et al., 2000; Ichimura et al., 2000; Tanida et al., 1999 30.

After induction of autophagy by rapamycin treatment, we isolated Atg8 membranes and confirmed high purity by western blot analysis. We found highly enriched 2GFP-Atg8 levels after isolation compared with membrane protein markers for the ER (Sec61) and vacuole (Vac8); both are organelles tethered to nascent autophagosomes, as well as a cytosolic protein (Pgk1) ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Moreover, using lipidomics analysis, we detected significant amounts of phospholipids from FAA1 cells, which increased upon inhibition of vacuolar fusion and the accumulation of autophagosomes in FAA1 Δ ypt7 cells ( Figures S6 B and S6D). In contrast, we recovered barely any phospholipids from FAA1 Δ atg7 cells ( Figure S6 D), demonstrating that the isolation of phospholipids depended on the covalent attachment of Atg8 to autophagic membranes. Together these data demonstrate high stringency and specificity of our method.
Having established this method, we next isolated Atg8 membranes out of FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells and in parallel from FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells lacking Atg7 (Δ atg7 ) as controls after 3 h of starvation and FAS inhibition. Consistent with the slight reduction in number and size of autophagosomes in PM-FAA1 cells ( Figures S5 A–S5C), we recovered moderately lower amounts of phospholipids from PM-FAA1 cells compared with FAA1 cells in a strictly Atg7-dependent manner ( Figure S6 E). We found that Atg8 membranes mainly consisted of PC (38%), PE (19%), and PI (37%), differing from the average whole cell membrane composition under this condition ( Figures 6 B and 6C, upper panels). Interestingly, compared to whole cell membranes, Atg8 membranes showed highly unsaturated FA profiles, consistent with previous observations ( Reunanen et al., 1985 85. Reunanen, H. ∙ Punnonen, E.L. ∙ Hirsimäki, P. Studies on vinblastine-induced autophagocytosis in mouse liver. V. A cytochemical study on the origin of membranes Histochemistry. 1985; 83 :513-517 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Around 60% of phospholipids contained two unsaturated FA residues (two double bonds), while only 2% carried two saturated FA moieties (0 double bonds) ( Figures 6 B and 6C, middle and bottom panels). FA desaturation increases membrane fluidity. Thus, our data indicate a FA composition of autophagic membranes highly conducive to dynamic phagophore behavior and shape. However, neither relative headgroup nor FA composition of Atg8 membranes differed significantly between FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells ( Figure 6 C), revealing that phagophores and autophagosomes that formed slowly in PM-FAA1 cells consisted of membranes with similar composition as in FAA1 cells. We reasoned that, although FA channeling by phagophore-bound Faa1 accelerated the expansion of phagophores, PM-tethered Faa1 may generate a compositionally similar pool of activated FAs albeit with lower local concentration. In conclusion, these data indicate that the differences in phagophore dynamics are not due to differences in autophagic membrane composition.
We reasoned that Faa1 may accumulate on nucleated phagophores in order to partition FA precursors locally into de novo phospholipid synthesis to generate a lipid source for efficient phagophore expansion. To directly test this model, we analyzed FA fluxes in vivo , using stable isotope tracing in combination with high-resolution mass spectrometry. We added 13 C-labeled palmitoleate ( 13 C16:1) or 13 C-labeled oleate ( 13 C18:1) to FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells for 30 min after 2.5 h of starvation and FAS inhibition and harvested cells for whole cell lipidomics. To assess the contribution of autophagy, we also tracked isotopic FAs in FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells blocked for autophagosome biogenesis (Δ atg1 ). We observed significant incorporation of both isotopic FAs into the major double-unsaturated PC, PE, and PI species in FAA1 cells ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Consistent with Faa1-dependent local FA partitioning into de novo phospholipid synthesis, isotopic FA incorporation was significantly reduced in PM-FAA1 cells compared with FAA1 cells ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Inhibition of autophagosome biogenesis in FAA1 Δ atg1 cells caused an overall moderate reduction in phospholipid synthesis compared with FAA1 cells ( Figure 6 D). Intriguingly, it specifically lowered the incorporation rate for single-labeled PC and PI species, which are also major constituents of Atg8 membranes, to a similar extent as in PM-FAA1 cells ( Figures 6 C and 6E), suggesting that autophagosome biogenesis, at least in parts, is coordinated with phospholipid synthesis. In keeping with this notion, the incorporation of isotopic FAs in PM-FAA1 cells was strongly reduced further in PM-FAA1 Δ atg1 cells ( Figures 6 D and 6E), suggesting that residual autophagosome biogenesis is largely responsible for the remaining phospholipid synthesis in PM-FAA1 cells ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Taken together, these data indicate that Faa1-mediated FA channeling and autophagosome biogenesis coordinately regulate de novo phospholipid synthesis during starvation.
Next, we directly tested whether newly synthesized phospholipids are incorporated into autophagic membranes. For this, we tracked isotopic FAs specifically in autophagic membranes by isolating Atg8 membranes from FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells after pulse labeling as described above. Strikingly, we detected significantly reduced isotopic FA incorporation into a broad spectrum of phospholipids of Atg8 membranes in PM-FAA1 cells compared with FAA1 cells ( Figures 6 D and 6F). Moreover, we found that Atg8 membranes incorporated newly synthesized phospholipids at a higher rate on average compared with whole cell membranes after tracing isotopic FAs in FAA1 cells for 5, 15, or 30 min and performing lipidomics in parallel on whole cell and isolated Atg8 membranes ( Figure 6 G). Taken together, these data strongly support the model that the localized activity of Faa1 on nucleated phagophores partitions FAs into the de novo synthesis of phospholipids, which are preferentially assembled into autophagic membranes.
Our model predicted that de novo synthesis is required for autophagy by providing phospholipids for membrane growth during phagophore expansion. To test this hypothesis, we examined the functional relevance of the two initial and committed steps for de novo phospholipid synthesis. Acyl-CoAs are incorporated into glycerol-3-phosphate or dihydroxyacetone-phosphate by the acyltransferases Gpt2 and Sct1, and, in the next step, into 1-acyl-gylcerol-3-phosphate by the acyltransferases Ale1 and Slc1 to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), the precursor for all major phospholipids ( Figure 7 A)( Athenstaedt and Daum, 1997; Benghezal et al., 2007; Henry et al., 2012; Jain et al., 2007; Riekhof et al., 2007; Zheng and Zou, 2001 3.

Fluorescence imaging of GFP-tagged variants of all four acyltransferases confirmed their uniform ER localization similar to ER-resident Sec63, indicating quantitative spatial association with forming autophagosomes ( Figure S7 A). De novo phospholipid synthesis is essential for viability. Thus, we designed two inducible genetic systems using the auxin-inducible degron (AID) approach by generating Δ gpt2 SCT1-AID HA and Δ slc1 ALE1-AID HA cells ( Morawska and Ulrich, 2013; Nishimura et al., 2009 68.

Methods. 2009; 6 :917-922 Crossref Scopus (628) PubMed Google Scholar ). Δ gpt2 SCT1-AID HA and Δ slc1 ALE1-AID HA cells pretreated with auxin for 3 h quantitatively reduced steady-state protein levels of AID-tagged Sct1 and Ale1 ( Figures 7 B and S7 B), which, upon starvation and FAS inhibition, strongly impaired autophagy flux compared with WT cells ( Figures 7 B and S7 B, right panel). In strong support of autophagy-specific effects, auxin-induced Δ gpt2 SCT1-AID HA and Δ slc1 ALE1-AID HA cells displayed WT-like turnover of the MVB pathway substrate Mup1-mCherry, endocytosis, and ERES and Atg9 vesicle number and association with forming autophagosomes ( Figures S7 C–S7F). Isotopic oleate ( 13 C18:1) tracing confirmed a significant reduction in de novo phospholipid synthesis upon auxin-treatment of Δ gpt2 SCT1-AID HA cells ( Figure 7 C). Strikingly, in contrast to untreated cells, auxin-treated Δ gpt2 SCT1-AID HA cells specifically displayed a strong impairment in phagophore dynamics with reduced expansion frequency, growth rate, and maximal size ( Figures 7 D–7F), phenocopying the defects in phagophore dynamics of PM-FAA1 cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate the essential nature of de novo phospholipid synthesis specifically for autophagic membrane expansion and autophagy downstream of Faa1-mediated FA channeling.

Section: Discussion

Here, we have identified the molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid and extensive membrane expansion during autophagosome biogenesis. Our study is consistent with prior work indicating that phagophores nucleate from mainly preexisting membranes contributed by Atg9 and COPII vesicles orchestrated by core autophagy machinery ( Davis et al., 2016; Ge et al., 2013, 2014, 2017; Graef et al., 2013; Ishihara et al., 2001; Karanasios et al., 2016; Longatti et al., 2012; Mari et al., 2010; Puri et al., 2018; Shima et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2013; Yamamoto et al., 2012; Young et al., 2006; Zoppino et al., 2010 12.

Autophagosome formation depends on the small GTPase Rab1 and functional ER exit sites Traffic. 2010; 11 :1246-1261 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we now describe that preformed organelle membranes, although they may contribute, are insufficient to sustain autophagosome formation downstream of nucleation. In fact, the vast majority of the autophagic membrane is assembled during phagophore expansion involving distinct and separable mechanisms. Specifically, our data show that the conserved ACS Faa1 accumulates on nucleated phagophores and locally channels activated FAs into the de novo synthesis of phospholipids within the neighboring ER. These newly synthesized phospholipids then critically drive the assembly and elongation of the phagophore membrane into functional autophagosomes ( Figure 7 G). In parallel to ACS, our work indicates that the FAS pathway can provide a redundant source of activated FAs for autophagy depending on physiological conditions in yeast, consistent with a recently suggested role of the FAS pathway in stationary phase-induced autophagy ( Gross et al., 2019 28. Gross, A.S. ∙ Zimmermann, A. ∙ Pendl, T. ... Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1-dependent lipogenesis promotes autophagy downstream of AMPK J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :12020-12039 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mammalian FAS produces free FAs that have to be activated by ACS ( Leibundgut et al., 2008 59. Leibundgut, M. ∙ Maier, T. ∙ Jenni, S. ... The multienzyme architecture of eukaryotic fatty acid synthases Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18 :714-725 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with a conserved function in autophagy in mammalian cells, we find that human ACSL4 fully replaces Faa1 in autophagy in yeast.
A key question that arises from our model is how phospholipids are physically transferred from the ER to expanding phagophores. Recent work showed that conserved Atg2-Atg18 complexes establish ER-phagophore contacts in vivo and transport phospholipids between opposing membranes in vitro ( Chowdhury et al., 2018; Gómez-Sánchez et al., 2018; Kotani et al., 2018; Osawa et al., 2019; Tamura et al., 2017; Valverde et al., 2019 10.

Thus, we propose that phagophore-bound Faa1 partitions activated FA into localized synthesis of phospholipids in the ER, which are then channeled via Atg2-18 complexes to the phagophore for expansion ( Figure 7 G). However, alternative and not mutually exclusive mechanisms may exist, including continuous ER-phagophore membrane connections in mammalian cells ( Biazik et al., 2015; Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009; Ylä-Anttila et al., 2009 7.

Notably, non-vesicular transfer of newly synthesized phospholipids provides a rationale for universal ER association of nascent autophagosomes and for the small inner volume and low membrane protein content of phagophores ( Baba et al., 1995; Biazik et al., 2015; Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009; Øverbye et al., 2007; Ylä-Anttila et al., 2009 5.

Why does autophagosome biogenesis rely on de novo phospholipid synthesis? We propose that substantial assembly of autophagic membranes from newly synthesized phospholipids allows minimized consumption and, thus, strain on the integrity of membrane-bound organelles, in line with previous suggestions ( Dupont et al., 2014 15. Dupont, N. ∙ Chauhan, S. ∙ Arko-Mensah, J. ... Neutral lipid stores and lipase PNPLA5 contribute to autophagosome biogenesis Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :609-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we suggest that localized de novo synthesis is a critical driver of net phospholipid transfer from the ER to phagophore membranes. First, concentrating Faa1 activity specifically onto nucleated phagophores instead of the ER network is ideally suited to spatiotemporally coordinate local “on-demand” de novo phospholipid synthesis within the ER with phagophore expansion. Second, compartmentalization of phospholipid synthesis may further aid the directionality of lipid transfer at ER-phagophore contacts. Supporting this concept, localized PS synthesis at MCSs facilitates PS transport from the ER to mitochondria ( Kannan et al., 2017 47. Kannan, M. ∙ Lahiri, S. ∙ Liu, L.K. ... Phosphatidylserine synthesis at membrane contact sites promotes its transport out of the ER J. Lipid Res. 2017; 58 :553-562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, phospholipid synthesis enzymes PIS, CEPT1, PSS1, and CPT1 are enriched at ER subdomains proximal to sites of autophagosome formation, and PC synthesis promotes autophagy in mammalian cells ( Andrejeva et al., 2019; Nishimura et al., 2017 2. Andrejeva, G. ∙ Gowan, S. ∙ Lin, G. ... De novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis is required for autophagosome membrane formation and maintenance during autophagy Autophagy. 2019; Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar 71. Nishimura, T. ∙ Tamura, N. ∙ Kono, N. ... Autophagosome formation is initiated at phosphatidylinositol synthase-enriched ER subdomains EMBO J. 2017; 36 :1719-1735 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). While future work is needed to define the molecular details, our model of localized ACS activity on receiving membranes in combination with compartmentalized phospholipid synthesis in the ER may serve as a general concept for the dynamic control of lipid flux between the ER and tethered organelles across MCSs in eukaryotic cells.
Our work describes the phospholipid composition of autophagic membranes characterized by a high degree of desaturation conducive to highly dynamic phagophore properties. Given that Faa1 interfaces cellular FA metabolism with autophagy, we predict that concentration and composition of available FA pools may directly affect physical nature and dynamics of expanding phagophores relevant for physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Consistently, acute or chronic exposure to high concentrations of FAs or high fat diets impairs autophagy, and impaired synthesis of desaturated FAs dampens autophagy in yeast and mammalian cells ( Ogasawara et al., 2014, 2017; Singh et al., 2009 74.

Autophagy regulates lipid metabolism Nature. 2009; 458 :1131-1135 Crossref Scopus (2034) PubMed Google Scholar ). In turn, cells might use intra- and extracellular FA sources to modulate autophagy with broad implications for cellular and organismal physiology. Indeed, mobilization of internal FAs from lipid droplets promotes autophagy and has been implicated in longevity in C. elegans ( Dupont et al., 2014; Lapierre et al., 2011; Shpilka et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2008 15.

In addition, fasting-induced uptake of external FAs into hypothalamic agouti-related peptide neurons induces autophagy, which is required for the control of neuropeptide-regulated food intake ( Kaushik et al., 2011 49.

In summary, our work provides a paradigm-shifting view on autophagosome biogenesis by defining the molecular principles generating autophagic membranes from newly synthesized phospholipids with broad implications for cell physiology, disease, and aging.

All strains used in this study are derivatives of Saccharomyces cerevisiae w303 and are listed in Table S1 . PCR-based targeted homologous recombination was used to obtain gene deletions by replacing complete ORFs by indicated cassettes as described previously ( Sheff and Thorn, 2004 88.

An expanded tool kit for the auxin-inducible degron system in budding yeast Yeast. 2013; 30 :341-351 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). FAA1 or PM-FAA1 strains were generated by replacing the FAA1 ORF with FAA1 (1-2100 bp) or a fusion of the SLM1 pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain (1402-1743 bp) and FAA1 (4-2100 bp) both linked to kanMX6 cassettes (pFA6a- kanMX6 ) in Δ atg19::natMX6/hphMX6 Δ faa3::TRP1 Δ faa4::HIS3 strain backgrounds.
Strains were grown in synthetic complete medium (0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (BD Difco) and 2% (w/v) α-D-glucose (Sigma)) or synthetic medium lacking respective amino acids for plasmid selection at 30°C. For starvation, cells were harvested from early log-phase, washed 5 times and resuspended in SD-N medium (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (BD Difco) and 2% (w/v) α-D-glucose (Sigma)) ± cerulenin (50 μg/mL; Sigma). SD-N-Glc contained α-D-glucose (0.01% (Sigma)). For fatty acid supplementation experiments, cells were grown in synthetic complete medium containing 0.1 mM oleic acid (C18:1, Sigma; dissolved in 5:1 (v/v) ethanol/tyloxapol (Merck/Sigma)) until log phase, washed 5 times and resuspended in SD-N medium containing 50 μg/mL cerulenin and 0.1 mM oleic acid. For stable isotope labeling, cells were starved in SD-N medium + cerulenin with oleic acid or palmitoleic acid ( 13 C18:1 or 13 C16:1 with all carbons labeled, Sigma; dissolved in 5:1 (v/v) ethanol/tyloxapol (Merck/Sigma)) at a final concentration of 0.01 mM for either 5, 15 or 30 min followed by cell harvest and sample processing. For auxin-inducible-degron (AID-tag) dependent protein degradation, early log phase cells were grown in SD medium containing 100 μM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (Sigma) for 3 h at 30°C, washed 5 times and resuspended in SD-N medium + cerulenin ± 100 μM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid. Rapamycin (400 ng/mL; Calbiochem) was added to media as indicated. To monitor the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, cells expressing plasmid-encoded MUP1-GFP (pMG3) were grown in synthetic media without methionine prior to starvation as described in ( Menant et al., 2006 65. Menant, A. ∙ Barbey, R. ∙ Thomas, D. Substrate-mediated remodeling of methionine transport by multiple ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms in yeast cells EMBO J. 2006; 25 :4436-4447 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). To monitor the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway at auxin-inducible-degron (AID-tag) dependent protein degradation, early log phase cells were grown in synthetic media without methionine containing 300 μM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (Sigma) for 3 h at 30°C, washed 5 times and resuspended in SD-N medium + cerulenin + 300 μM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid. To visualize vacuoles by fluorescence microscopy, FM4-64 was added at a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) (ThermoFisher) to the media.
All plasmids were generated by “gap repair”-PCR-based targeted recombination in yeast as described previously ( Oldenburg et al., 1997 76. Oldenburg, K.R. ∙ Vo, K.T. ∙ Michaelis, S. ... Recombination-mediated PCR-directed plasmid construction in vivo in yeast Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25 :451-452 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and are listed in Table S2 . Briefly, plasmids pRS315 or pRS316 were linearized using endonucleases BamH I and Hind III and co-transformed with PCR fragments flanked by ≥ 40 bp homologous sequences (pRS315/6 sequences: 5′-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTG-3′; 5′-CAAGCT CGGAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTG-3′). For pMG3 and pMG27, prMUP1-MUP1 (−886 to 1722 bp) was combined in frame with either yEGFP-CaURA3 - or mCherry-kanMX6 (forward: 5′-GGTGACGGTGCTGGTTTA-3′; backward: 5′-TCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG-3′) derived from pFA6a- yEGFP-CaURA3 or pFA6a-mCherry-kanMX6 respectively. pMG4 was generated by combining the ADH1 -promoter (prADH1: −379 to −1 bp), yEGFP (1-711 bp; pFA6a- yEGFP-CaURA3 ), linker (link42: 5′-GGTGCT GGTGCTAACATTTTAGGTGCTGGTGACGGTGGTGCT-3′), and yEGFP-CaURA3 . pMG5-pMG8 were obtained from prFAA1-FAA1 (−1000 to 2100 bp; faa1-Y269A: T805G, A806C; faa1-E460A: A1379C, G1380T; faa1-W533A: T1597G, G1598C, G1599T), and mCherry-kanMX6 (forward: 5′-GGTGACGGTGCTGGTTTA-3′; backward: 5′-TCGATGAATTCG AGCTCG-3′ derived from pFA6a -mCherry-kanMX6 ). pMG9-pMG15 were constructed by combining prVAC8-VAC8 (−1000 to 1734 bp), prSEC24-SEC24 (−1000 to 2778 bp), prSEC61-SEC61 (−1000 to 1440 bp), or prICE2-ICE2 (−1000 to 1473 bp) with linker (link42), FAA1 or faa1-Y269A (1 to 2100 bp), and mCherry-kanMX6 ( Malcova et al., 2016 63. Malcova, I. ∙ Farkasovsky, M. ∙ Senohrabkova, L. ... New integrative modules for multicolor-protein labeling and live-cell imaging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae FEMS Yeast Res. 2016; 16 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). The plasmid pMG24 was derived from the centromeric plasmid pMG23 and cloned into the multicopy vector pRS425 after linearization using endonucleases BamH I and Hind III. For pMG25 and pMG26 ACSL4 splice variant 1 (ACSL4v1) from H. sapiens (1-2010 bp) (pcDNA-ACSL4v1-eGFP; OHu2430c; Genscript) was fused to either 3xyeGFP-CaURA3 or mCherry-kanMX6 under control of FAA1 promoter (−1000 to −1 bp).
After incubating cells in 0.2% (v/v) trypan blue (Sigma) for 5 min and five washes with 1xPBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline, GIBCO), cell viability was assessed by brightfield microscopy and expressed as the ratio of blue-stained (dead) and unstained (viable) cells.
Cells were transferred to 96-well glass bottom microplates (Greiner Bio-One) containing indicated media. For fixed time point analyses, cells were imaged at room temperature with an inverted microscope (Nikon Ti-E) using a Plan Apochromat IR 60x 1.27 NA objective (Nikon) and Spectra X LED light source (Lumencor). Three-dimensional light microscopy data were collected using the triggered Z-Piezo system (Nikon) and orca flash 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu). Three-dimensional data were processed using NIS-elements AR (Nikon), Huygens Professional 16.10 (Scientific Volume Imaging) and Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) software. Data are shown as single sections. Time-lapse analyses were performed at 30°C with an inverted microscope (Visitron CSU-X1; Zeiss) using an alpha-Plan Apochromat 100x 1.46 NA oil immersion objective (Zeiss) and orca flash 4.0 V2 digital camera (Hamamatsu). High-speed confocal imaging was performed at 30°C with a Dragonfly 500 series microscope (Andor, Oxford instruments) equipped with a Zyla 4.2 Plus sCMos camera (Andor) using a Lamba CFI-Plan Apochromat 100x 1.45 NA oil immersion objective (Nikon). Three-dimensional data were processed using Fusion software (Andor), and ImageJ Version 2.0.0.
FAA1 and PM-FAA1 cells expressing 2GFP-ATG8 and harboring pRS425 -prCUP1-APE1-prAPE1-tagBFP-APE1 were harvested at early log-phase, resuspended in SD medium containing 250 μM CuSO 4 (Roth) and incubated for 3 h at 30°C. Cells were pelleted, washed 5 times and resuspended in starvation medium containing 50 μg/mL cerulenin. After 2 h 45 min of starvation, cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy and Z stacks were recorded for 24 time points at 2 min intervals. To determine expansion frequency of phagophores, punctate Atg8 structures formed at giant preApe1 oligomers were followed over time and scored as “nonexpanding” in the absence of lateral growth. For growth rate and maximal size determination, phagophores were treated as spherical caps forming on spherical giant preApe1 oligomers. Using line diagrams in ImageJ (Version 2.0.0), diameters of giant preApe1 oligomers (2r) and of Atg8-marked puncta/spherical caps (2a) at the beginning (t 0 ) and at the time of maximal expansion (t max ) were measured. The surface of spherical caps was derived from calculating cap height (h = r-(r 2 -a 2 ) 1/2 ) and equation A = 2πhr for time points t 0 and t max . The change in surface area over time was expressed as the growth rate of the phagophore membrane: Figure viewer
Determining phagophore expansion frequency, growth rate and maximal size.
Autophagic membranes (2GFP-Atg8; green) forming on giant preApe1 oligomers (BFP-preApe1; blue) were analyzed at the beginning (t 0 ) and at the time point of maximal expansion (t max ). Corresponding heights (h) and surface areas (A) are calculated for both time points based on the diameter of the preApe1 oligomer (2r) and of the phagophore (2a 0 and 2a max ).
Cells corresponding to 60 OD 600 -units were harvested and directly treated as described previously ( Kaiser and Schekman, 1990 43. Kaiser, C.A. ∙ Schekman, R. Distinct sets of SEC genes govern transport vesicle formation and fusion early in the secretory pathway Cell. 1990; 61 :723-733 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overnight potassium permanganate fixed cells were embedded in Epon (Sigma). After total polymerization, ultrathin sections (50-70nm) were mounted on nickel grids. The contrast of samples was increased by 1% (v/v) uranyl acetate (SERVA) and subsequent 0.1% (w/v) lead citrate (Sigma) staining in 0.1 M NaOH (Roth). Grids were imaged using a Jem-2100Plus transmission electron microscope (Joel) equipped with an OneView 4K Bottom camera (Gatan).
Cells corresponding to 0.2 OD 600 -units were collected and lysed by alkaline whole cell extraction using 0.255 M NaOH (Roth) and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (Merck). For phosphoprotein analysis, lysis buffer and SDS sample buffer were supplemented with 1 mM NaF and 20 mM β-phosphoglycerol (Sigma). Protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using α-Pgk1 (monoclonal, Abcam), α-GFP (monoclonal, Takara), α-mCherry (polyclonal, Genetex), α-HA (monoclonal, Sigma), α-Atg13 (polyclonal, a gift from Prof. Daniel Klionsky), α-Sec61 (polyclonal, a gift from Prof. Tom Raporport), α-Vac8 (polyclonal, a gift from Dr. Takashi Tatsuta) antibodies. Primary antibodies were visualized using corresponding secondary α-mouse or α-rabbit Dylight800/680 antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals) and signal intensities were quantified using the Li-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (Biosciences).
Cells corresponding to 125 OD 600 -units expressing 2GFP-ATG8 were pelleted, washed and resuspended in 150 mM NaCl (Roth), 50 mM Tris/HCl pH7.5 (Roth), 1 mM MgCl 2 (Roth), 10% (v/v) glycerol (Sigma), 1xProtease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell pellets were created in liquid N 2 and stored at −80°C. Frozen cell pellets were lysed using a Freezer/Mill (6970EFM, SPEX® Metuchen, NJ; settings T1 = 1 min; T2 = 2 min; T3 = 2 min; cycles, 2; rate, 7). Thawed cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm and 12000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min each. Supernatants were incubated with μMACS anti-GFP Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were isolated using Miltenyi μ-columns and a MultiMACS® M96 Seperator (Miltenyi Biotec). Columns were washed 5 times with 800 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma).
For analysis by western blotting as shown in Figure S6 C, samples were eluted by addition of 150 μL SDS-sample buffer. For analyses by mass spectrometry, on-bead digestion was performed by addition of 100 μL trypsin (300 ng/column, Sigma) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma) for 1 h at 23°C. Samples were eluted by addition of 150 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After overnight incubation at 23°C, reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma). The aqueous solution was evaporated in a SpeedVac (Eppendorf) and analyzed by Nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis or high-resolution mass spectrometry .
Cells corresponding to 10 OD 600 -units were harvested and homogenized in 300 μL water using a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Peqlab) at 6500 rpm for 30 s. Protein content of the homogenate was routinely determined using bicinchoninic acid. Lipids were extracted using “One-Step Extraction” described in ( Özbalci et al., 2013 79. Özbalci, C. ∙ Sachsenheimer, T. ∙ Brügger, B. Quantitative analysis of cellular lipids by nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1033 :3-20 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ): 100 μL homogenate were diluted to 500 μL with Milli-Q water and mixed with 1.875 mL chloroform/methanol 1:2 (v/v) (Sigma) and internal standards (67 pmol PC 17:0-14:1, 81 pmol PE 17:0-14:1, 63 pmol PI 17:0-14:1, 68 pmol PS 17:0-14:1, 77 pmol PG 17:0-14:1, 82 pmol PA 17:0-14:1 (Avanti Polar Lipids)). After the addition of 0.5 mL chloroform and 0.5 mL H 2 O, the sample was vigorously vortexed and phase separation was induced by centrifugation (800xg for 5 min at 4°C). The lower organic phase was transferred to a second vial and the remaining phases were washed with chloroform and H 2 O, respectively. The organic phase of the second vial was transferred to a third vial and the organic phase of the initial vial was combined with the aqueous phase of the second vial followed by re-extraction. After phase separation, the organic phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Dried lipid extracts were dissolved in 300 μl methanol and analyzed by Nano-ESI-MS/MS as described in ( Kumar et al., 2015 55. Kumar, V. ∙ Bouameur, J.E. ∙ Bär, J. ... A keratin scaffold regulates epidermal barrier formation, mitochondrial lipid composition, and activity J. Cell Biol. 2015; 211 :1057-1075 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ): 20 μl lipid extract in methanol were transferred into 96-well plates and diluted with 20 μl ammonium acetate (20 mM in methanol). Lipid infusion and ionization was performed using Nano-ESI chips with the TriVersa NanoMate operated by the ChipSoft Software (Advion) using the following settings: sample infusion volume: 14 μl; air volume to aspirate after sample: 1 μl; air gap before chip: enabled, aspiration delay: 0 s; prepiercing: with mandrel; spray sensing: enabled; cooling temperature: 14°C; gas pressure: 0.5 psi; ionization voltage: 1.4 kV; and vent headspace: enabled. Prewetting was done once.
Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using the QTRAP 6500 (SCIEX) operated by Analyst 1.6.2 with instrument-dependent settings as follows: curtain gas, 20 psi; CAD gas, medium; and interface heater temperature, 100°C. PC was analyzed in the positive ion mode by scanning for precursors of m/z 184 Da at a collision energy of 35 eV. PE, PS, PG, PI, and PA analysis were performed in the positive ion mode by scanning for neutral losses of 141, 185, 189, 277, and 115 Da at 25 eV collision energy. The declustering potential was 100 V. Scanning was performed in a mass range of m/z 650–900 Da and at a scan rate of 200 Da/s. 61 MCA spectra were accumulated. Mass spectra were processed by the LipidView Software Version 1.2 (SCIEX) for identification and quantification of glycerophospholipids. Endogenous glycerophospolipids were quantified by normalizing their peak areas to those of the internal standards.
Lipids were extracted essentially as described in ( Ejsing et al., 2009 17. Ejsing, C.S. ∙ Sampaio, J.L. ∙ Surendranath, V. ... Global analysis of the yeast lipidome by quantitative shotgun mass spectrometry Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :2136-2141 Crossref Scopus (601) PubMed Google Scholar ): pellets were resuspended in 200 μL 155 mM ammonium carbonate. After addition of 990 μL 17:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol and internal standards (s. above), lipids were extracted for 30 min at 20°C using a ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf) at 900 rpm. Phases were separated by centrifugation (16000xg for 5 min at 4°C). The lower organic phase was transferred to a new tube; the upper phase was extracted again with 990 μL chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/). Combined organic phases were dried under a stream of nitrogen. Dried lipid extracts were resuspended in 200 μL methanol and analyzed by Nano-ESI-MS/MS as described above.
Cells corresponding to 10 OD 600 -units were washed in 300 μL water, harvested and homogenized using a Tissue Lyser2 (Quiagen) at −180°C with 25Hz for 2 cycles of 1 min.
Lipids were extracted as described previously for isotope labeled plant tissues ( Giavalisco et al., 2011 24. Giavalisco, P. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Matthes, A. ... Elemental formula annotation of polar and lipophilic metabolites using (13) C, (15) N and (34) S isotope labelling, in combination with high-resolution mass spectrometry Plant J. 2011; 68 :364-376 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the homogenate was resuspended in 850 μL of pre-cooled (−20°C) extraction buffer methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/methanol 3:1 (v/v)), containing a 500-fold diluted Splash II Lipidomix (Avantilipids) as an internal standard. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 4°C while shaking at 1500 rpm. Samples were sonicated for 10 min at 0°C in a bath-type sonicator (VWR) and 500 μL phase separation buffer of UPLC-grade water/methanol 3:1 (v/v) was added. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 4°C shaking at 1500 rpm. Centrifugation, separated samples into three distinct phases. For lipidomic analysis the upper lipid phase was collected and stored at −20°C, until mass spectrometric analysis. The remaining lipid and polar phase were discarded and the solid pellet kept for protein quantification.
For high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis yeast whole membrane lipid extracts or isolated Atg8 membranes were dried in a speed vac concentrator (Eppendorf). After resuspension of samples in either 50 μL or 200 μL UPLC-grade acetonitrile/isopropanol 7:3 (v/v) (VWR), lipids were further solubilized for 5 min at 0°C in a bath-type sonicator (VWR). Following 5 min centrifugation, the cleared supernatant fraction was transferred to 2 mL glass vials with 200 μL inserts (CZT) and placed in an Acquity iClass UPLC (Waters) sample manager at 6°C. The UPLC was connected to a Q-Exactive (QE)-HF high-resolution mass spectrometer, equipped with a heated ESI (HESI) source (Thermofischer). Each sample was injected twice with an injection volume of 2 μL of lipid. Lipids were separated on a 100 × 1.0 mm BEH C8 UPLC column, packed with 1.7 μm particles (Waters). The flow rate of the UPLC was set to 150 μl/min and the buffer system consisted of buffer A (10 mM ammonium acetate, 0.1% acetic acid in UPLC-grade water) and buffer B (10 mM ammonium acetate, 0.1% acetic acid in UPLC-grade acetonitrile/isopropanol 7:3 (v/v)). The UPLC gradient was as follows: 0-1 min 45% A, 1-4 min 45%–25% A, 4-12 min 25%–11% A, 12-15 min 11%–1% A, 15-18 min 1% A, 18-18.1 min 1%–45% A and 18.1-22 min re-equilibrating at 45% A. This leads to a total runtime of 22 min per sample.
The QE-HF mass spectrometer was operating for the first injection in positive ionization mode and for the second injection in negative ionization mode. In both cases, the analyzed mass range was between m/z 150-1500. The resolution was set to 60.000, leading to approximately 4 scans per second. The acquired gain control (AGC) was set to a value of 3E6, while the maximal ion time was set to 100 ms. The HESI source was operating with a spray voltage of 3.5 kV in positive ionization mode, while 3.2 kV were applied in negative ionization mode. The capillary temperature was 250°C, the sheath gas flow 60 arbitrary units (AU) and the auxiliary gas flow 20 AU at 250°C. The S-lens was fixed on 60 AU. All samples were analyzed in a randomized run-order and the data were analyzed using a targeted approach employing the quan module of the TraceFinder 4.1 software (Thermofischer) in combination with a sample-specific in-house generated compound database. For analysis of stable isotope labeled fatty acid incorporation into distinct lipid species of the main lipid classes, m/z values of either unlabeled ( 12 C fatty acid-containing) or labeled ( 13 C fatty acid-containing; Sigma) lipid species were calculated and areas of resulting peaks were extracted from raw data. Ratios of areas from unlabeled to labeled lipid species were used to determine the synthesis rates of diverse lipid classes.
Error bars represent SD as indicated in the figure legends. Data were processed in Excel.
Statistical analysis of differences between two groups was performed using a two-tailed, unpaired t test; ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001. Only statistically significant comparisons are indicated in graphs.
The lipidomics datasets generated during this study are available at Mendeley data ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17632/6hh9dhwpwj.1 ).
