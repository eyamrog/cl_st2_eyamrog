Title: Cellular bases of olfactory circuit assembly revealed by systematic time-lapse imaging


Abstract: Summary

Neural circuit assembly features simultaneous targeting of numerous neuronal processes from constituent neuron types, yet the dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we use the Drosophila olfactory circuit to investigate dynamic cellular processes by which olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) target axons precisely to specific glomeruli in the ipsi- and contralateral antennal lobes. Time-lapse imaging of individual axons from 30 ORN types revealed a rich diversity in extension speed, innervation timing, and ipsilateral branch locations and identified that ipsilateral targeting occurs via stabilization of transient interstitial branches. Fast imaging using adaptive optics-corrected lattice light-sheet microscopy showed that upon approaching target, many ORN types exhibiting “exploring branches” consisted of parallel microtubule-based terminal branches emanating from an F-actin-rich hub. Antennal nerve ablations uncovered essential roles for bilateral axons in contralateral target selection and for ORN axons to facilitate dendritic refinement of postsynaptic partner neurons. Altogether, these observations provide cellular bases for wiring specificity establishment.

Section: Introduction

The proper function of the nervous system relies on the precise assembly of neuronal circuits. During development, individual neurons extend their axons and dendrites to match with their synaptic partners. Axons are led by growth cones, which navigate through complex extracellular environment at each step of their journey. Numerous neurons are performing this act simultaneously within any given neural region. Although great strides have been made in the past decades to identify molecules that control axon guidance, dendrite elaboration, and target selection ( Jan and Jan, 2010 24. Jan, Y.N. ∙ Jan, L.Y.

Because of its high temporal resolution, time-lapse imaging has been utilized to define key cellular events in neuronal wiring. Notable examples include discovering growth cone dynamics in tissue culture ( Harrison, 1910 19. Harrison, R.G. The outgrowth of the nerve fiber as a mode of protoplasmic movement J. Exp.

Frazzled promotes growth cone attachment at the source of a Netrin gradient in the Drosophila visual system eLife. 2016; 5 :e20762 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most studies have focused on a single group of cells at a specific developmental stage. It remains unclear how growth cone dynamics of the same neuron change at different stages of circuit assembly and the extent to which different types of neurons in the same circuit follow the same rules.
The Drosophila olfactory system has served as a model for investigating the mechanisms of neural circuit assembly. Axons of 50 types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and dendrites of 50 types of projection neurons (PNs) form 1-to-1 connections in 50 discrete, stereotyped, and individually identifiable glomeruli in the antennal lobe to relay olfactory information from the periphery to the brain ( Vosshall and Stocker, 2007 55. Vosshall, L.B. ∙ Stocker, R.F. Molecular architecture of smell and taste in Drosophila Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30 :505-533 Crossref Scopus (678) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the assembly of the adult olfactory system, PNs first extend dendrites to establish a coarse map ( Jefferis et al., 2004 26. Jefferis, G.S. ∙ Vyas, R.M. ∙ Berdnik, D. ... Developmental origin of wiring specificity in the olfactory system of Drosophila Development. 2004; 131 :117-130 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). ORN axons then choose the dorsolateral or ventromedial trajectory to circumnavigate the antennal lobe, cross the midline, and invade the ipsi- and contralateral antennal lobes to find their synaptic partners ( Jefferis et al., 2004 26. Jefferis, G.S. ∙ Vyas, R.M. ∙ Berdnik, D. ... Developmental origin of wiring specificity in the olfactory system of Drosophila Development. 2004; 131 :117-130 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ; Joo et al., 2013 27.

Linking cell fate, trajectory choice, and target selection: genetic analysis of Sema-2b in olfactory axon targeting Neuron. 2013; 78 :673-686 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). A multitude of cellular and molecular mechanisms have been identified that direct dendrite and axon targeting of selected PN and ORN types ( Hong and Luo, 2014 20. Hong, W. ∙ Luo, L. Genetic control of wiring specificity in the fly olfactory system Genetics. 2014; 196 :17-29 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ); some mechanisms first discovered in the fly olfactory system were subsequently found to be conserved in wiring the mammalian brain ( Hong et al., 2012 21. Hong, W. ∙ Mosca, T.J. ∙ Luo, L. Teneurins instruct synaptic partner matching in an olfactory map Nature. 2012; 484 :201-207 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Berns et al., 2018 4.

Still, we are far from understanding the developmental algorithms that orchestrate the precise wiring of 50 pairs of ORN and PN types. Time-lapse imaging can provide cellular context in which wiring molecules exert their functions. Moreover, the ease of identifying neuron types based on their glomerular targets can determine the degree to which different neuron types use the same wiring rules.
Here, based on a previous protocol for studying the fly visual system in explant cultures ( Özel et al., 2015 40. Özel, M.N. ∙ Langen, M. ∙ Hassan, B.A. ... Filopodial dynamics and growth cone stabilization in Drosophila visual circuit development eLife. 2015; 4 :e10721 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), we developed an antennae-brain explant preparation that recapitulates the precision by which the olfactory circuit is assembled in vivo . Time-lapse imaging of 30 ORN types revealed heterogenous axon targeting behaviors that contribute to the eventual wiring specificity. High-resolution adaptive optical lattice light-sheet microscopy (AO-LLSM) enabled us to discover an axon terminal structure prior to ORN axons reaching targets. We also found that cytoskeletal organization of ORN axon terminals differs substantially from that of the classic growth cones from neurons in primary culture. Finally, ORN axon ablation uncovered essential roles for bilateral ORN axons in contralateral target selection, and for ORN axons to facilitate dendritic refinement of PNs.

Section: Results

The wiring specificity of the adult Drosophila olfactory circuit is established during the first half of the ∼100-h pupal stage ( Jefferis et al., 2004 26. Jefferis, G.S. ∙ Vyas, R.M. ∙ Berdnik, D. ... Developmental origin of wiring specificity in the olfactory system of Drosophila Development. 2004; 131 :117-130 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ), when the brain is covered with opaque fat bodies that prevent fluorescence imaging. To obtain high-quality images of the developing olfactory circuit from live tissues, we established an explant system containing the pupal brain, antennae, and their connecting nerves ( Figures 1 B and 1C). The dissected antennae-brain explant was then immobilized on a Sylgard plate and cultured for 24–48 h.
To assess the degree to which olfactory circuit development ex vivo mimics in vivo conditions, we monitored targeting of single axons from two specific ORN types labeled by AM29-GAL4 ( Endo et al., 2007 10. Endo, K. ∙ Aoki, T. ∙ Yoda, Y. ... Notch signal organizes the Drosophila olfactory circuitry by diversifying the sensory neuronal lineages Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10 :153-160 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the DL4 and DM6 glomeruli using the MARCM strategy ( Lee and Luo, 1999 32. Lee, T. ∙ Luo, L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis Neuron. 1999; 22 :451-461 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2074) PubMed Google Scholar ). At 38 h after puparium formation (h APF) in vivo , individual glomeruli had not developed and ORN axons were still finding their ways to the eventual targets ( Figure 1 D, left). At 50 h APF in vivo , antennal lobes were substantially larger, glomeruli were individually identifiable by neuropil staining, and axons of a given ORN type innervated one of 50 glomeruli in the ipsi- and contralateral antennal lobes ( Figure 1 D, middle). When we dissected brain and antennae at 38 h APF and cultured the explant for 24 h ex vivo , the antennal lobe volumes increased compared to 38 h APF in vivo , individual glomeruli were readily identifiable, and AM29-GAL4 + ORN axons elaborate their terminals at positions similar to the DL4 and DM6 glomeruli in vivo ( Figure 1 D, right). AM29-GAL4 + ORN axons occasionally targeted regions outside the DM6 and DL4 glomeruli in culture ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Interestingly, minor targeting to similar regions was also observed in vivo during the intermediate developmental stages and became less frequent later ( Figures S1 A and S1B). These data indicate that the olfactory circuit develops similarly in our explant culture as in vivo , albeit at a slower pace (requiring about 2× the time).
To test whether the explant could be subjected to two-photon microscopy imaging, we imaged axons of all DM6 and DL4 ORNs ( Figure 1 E; Video S1 ) or axons of all ORN types ( Figure S1 C). The growth and targeting of ORN axons were not disrupted by continuous imaging for 24 h once every 20 min, suggesting little photo damage at this imaging frequency. Thus, this explant system can be used for long-term live imaging study of olfactory circuit assembly.

We next attempted to live image individual axons of multiple ORN types. Each ORN type comprises on average ∼30 ORNs from each antenna, making it impossible to distinguish single ORN terminals even with a GAL4 line that only labels one ORN type. To achieve sparse and strong labeling from early development, we modified the FLPout strategy ( Wong et al., 2002 57. Wong, A.M. ∙ Wang, J.W. ∙ Axel, R. Spatial representation of the glomerular map in the Drosophila protocerebrum Cell. 2002; 109 :229-241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar ) by using FRT sites with reduced recombination efficiency ( Figure 2 A). By introducing point mutations in FRT ( Senecoff et al., 1988 49. Senecoff, J.F. ∙ Rossmeissl, P.J. ∙ Cox, M.M. DNA recognition by the FLP recombinase of the yeast 2 mu plasmid. A mutational analysis of the FLP binding site J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201 :405-421 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), we generated two reporters, UAS-FRT 10 -stop-FRT 10 -mCD8-GFP ( Figure S1 D) and UAS-FRT 100 -stop-FRT 100 -mCD8-GFP ( Figure 2 B), which were approximately 10× and 100× less efficient than wild-type FLP/ FRT , respectively.
Using UAS-FRT 100 -stop-FRT 100 -mCD8-GFP , we could randomly label a few ORNs out of ∼1,500 per antenna expressing mCD8-GFP driven by the pan-ORN pebbled-GAL4 driver via heat shock-induced FLP expression ( Figure 2 B). From ∼1,000 pupal brain dissected at 30 h APF, we selected 75 brains in which one or few axons just arrived at the antennal lobe. We performed time-lapse imaging in explant culture once every 20 min for the next 24 h, covering the entire targeting process in the antennal lobe ( Figure 2 C). The identity of each ORN was determined by post hoc immunostaining of the fixed explants ( Figure 2 D). We extracted 90 single ORNs from these 75 brains, covering 28 ORN types ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S2 A; Video S2 ). These time-lapse images provided a valuable dataset to analyze how individual ORN axons find their targets, as detailed in the next four sections.

Time-lapse images showing targeting of a single DM2 ORN axon, related to Figure 2 Dashed circles outline the antennal lobes and dashed vertical line marks the midline. Max intensity projections of image stacks taken every 20 min using a two-photon microscope.
The 90 single ORNs we selected based on axon arrival at the antennal lobe at 30 h APF covered only a subset of ORN types with different frequencies ( Figures 2 E and 2F), suggesting heterogeneity in axon arrival time for different ORN types. To extend this finding, we compared explant cultures initiated at 26 h, 30 h, and 34 h APF, and determined the glomerular identity after 24–48 h culture ( Figure S3 A). We found that early-arriving ORN axons tended to target more posterior glomeruli, whereas late-arriving ORN axons tended to target more anterior glomeruli ( Figures S3 B and S3C). This temporal sequence did not appear to result from ORN birth timing ( Figure S3 D) but is consistent with a previous report using two genetic drivers ( Okumura et al., 2016 39. Okumura, M. ∙ Kato, T. ∙ Miura, M. ... Hierarchical axon targeting of Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons specified by the proneural transcription factors Atonal and Amos Genes Cells. 2016; 21 :53-64 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, different ORN types not only target axons to spatially segregated glomeruli, but their axons also arrive at the antennal lobe following a temporal sequence. This temporal segregation should reduce the complexity of cellular context with which axons of each ORN type interact as they navigate.
Previous live imaging studies reported that axons slow down at specific choice points ( Godement et al., 1994 12. Godement, P. ∙ Wang, L.C. ∙ Mason, C.A.

Bak, M. ∙ Fraser, S.E. Axon fasciculation and differences in midline kinetics between pioneer and follower axons within commissural fascicles Development. 2003; 130 :4999-5008 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine whether ORN axons change speed during their journey, we measured the axon growth speed of 5 ORN types that had more than 3 samples, targeting three lateral glomeruli (green shades in Figures 3 A and 3B) and two medial glomeruli (red and magenta in Figures 3 A and 3B). To analyze ORN axon growth in the ipsilateral antennal lobe, we defined the last imaging scan before midline crossing as time 0. We found that ORN axons grew at an average speed of 2–6 μm/20-min intervals when they circumnavigated the ipsilateral antennal lobe ( Figure 3 B, left). This speed reduced to 0–2 μm/20 mins right before midline crossing for all 5 types (solid arrow in Figures 3 A and 3B).
To analyze ORN axon growth in the contralateral antennal lobe, we defined the time of first imaging scan after midline crossing as time 0. Right after midline crossing (open arrow in Figures 3 A and 3B), axon growth differed depending on their target locations. The growth cones of ORNs targeting the lateral antennal lobe, which do not need to make a turn, had needle-like shape ( Figures S4 A and S4B) and grew fast (∼10 μm/20 min). By contrast, the growth cones of ORN axons targeting the medial antennal lobe, which requires an ∼90° turn ventrally, exhibited more complex morphologies with multiple transient branches ( Figures S4 A′ and S4B) and grew slower ( Figure 3 B, right). Thus, ORN axon growth slows down prior to midline crossing and during large turns in their trajectory.
Selective axon branching enables the same neuron to innervate multiple targets. Axon branching can occur via growth cone splitting or interstitial branching ( Figure S4 C). Interstitial branching occurs widely in vertebrate CNS neurons, but axons of dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons branch by growth cone splitting ( Kalil and Dent, 2014 28. Kalil, K. ∙ Dent, E.W. Branch management: mechanisms of axon branching in the developing vertebrate CNS Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15 :7-18 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because most ORN axons innervate the same glomerulus in both the ipsi- and contralateral antennal lobe, each ORN must send one branch to innervate the ipsilateral glomerulus (ipsilateral branch hereafter) and another branch to cross the midline and innervate the contralateral glomerulus ( Figure 1 A).
To determine the cellular mechanism of ORN axon branching, we measured from our time-lapse series the interval between when the axon reached its eventual ipsilateral branch point and the first appearance of the ipsilateral branch ( i , see Figure S4 D). If branches form by growth cone splitting, they should form at the most terminal end of the axons. Thus, as soon as the contralateral projecting axon passes the eventual ipsilateral branch point, we should observe the ipsilateral branch ( i should be 0). However, most of the 90 single ORNs formed the ipsilateral branch with i ≥ 1 ( Figure 3 C). Thus, most ORN axons innervate their ipsilateral glomeruli via interstitial branching.
Three ORN types had i = 0 ( Figures 3 C and S4 D), suggesting that they could branch via growth cone splitting, or that interstitial branching occurred within a 20-min imaging session after the growth cone passed the branch point. (Fast imaging data presented below suggest the latter is the case.) We note that i values have large variations among different ORN types ( Figure 3 C), and ORN types with early-arriving axons tended to have larger i than those with late-arriving axons ( Figure S4 E). Accordingly, ORNs with smaller i exhibited sequential innervation in the two antennal lobes ( Figure S4 F), whereas ORNs with large i showed more synchronized innervation in the two antennal lobes ( Figure S4 G).
Determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ipsilateral branch formation can suggest target selection mechanisms. A priori, several mechanisms can be envisioned. (1) The branch point of a given ORN type is genetically specified to be closest to the final glomerular target, such that the ipsilateral branch has the shortest distance to travel ( Figure S5 A 1 ). (2) The branch point may be random, and the ipsilateral branch explores a large region before reaching its target ( Figure S5 A 2 ). (3) ORN axons produce transient interstitial branches at multiple locations and stabilize the branches that connect with the target ( Figure S5 A 3 ). To distinguish between these models, we first measured the ipsilateral branch point position with respect to the entire ipsilateral trajectory from 0 (antennal lobe entry point) to 100 (midline crossing point) using ipsilateral branch point index y ( Figures S5 B–S5D). Comparing y and glomerular location in the adult antennal lobe revealed that ORNs targeting axons to increasingly dorsomedial glomeruli had increasingly larger y ( Figures 3 D and S5 D), suggesting that ORN axons form ipsilateral branches close to their future glomerular targets.
Closer examinations of our time-lapse videos revealed that all ORN axons exhibited multiple transient interstitial branches in the ipsilateral antennal lobe before the innervation of ipsilateral glomeruli. These interstitial branches occurred much less frequently after the ipsilateral branch reached the target ( Figure 3 E). For ORN types that formed the ipsilateral branch shortly after the main axon passed the ipsilateral branching point (small i in Figure 3 C), dynamic interstitial branches disappeared soon after the ipsilateral branch reached the ipsilateral target region ( Figure 3 F). For ORN types that had delayed ipsilateral branch formation (large i in Figure 3 C), dynamic interstitial branches persisted well after the contralateral branch crossed the midline ( Figure 3 G; Video S3 ). These observations suggest that ipsilateral branches form via stabilization of dynamic interstitial branches by target-derived signals, which in turn inhibits further interstitial branching. This mechanism explains the correlation of branching points and glomerular positions ( Figure 3 D).

Asterisks denote transient interstitial branches. Max intensity projections of image stacks taken every 20 min using a two-photon microscope.
In addition to the dynamic interstitial branches, we also observed highly dynamic growth of ipsilateral branches toward the final targeting regions ( Figures S5 F and S5G). Although individual neurons of a given ORN type exhibited certain stereotypy—DL1 axons extended ventromedially toward their target, whereas DM1 axons hugged around the branching points because of the proximity of the target to the main ORN axon trajectory—they also exhibited considerable variation in detailed branching patterns across time. Both DL1 and DM1 ipsilateral branches exhibited dynamic extension and retraction (arrows in Figures S5 F and S5G) instead of steady growth toward target, suggesting that they were actively exploring the local region for target selections.
After midline crossing, contralateral axons of most ORN types followed the ipsilateral axon trajectory of their counterparts and stopped near their targets ( Figure S2 A; Video S2 ). In a subset of ORNs, contralateral axons overshot their targets followed by pruning ( Figure S5 E; Video S4 ).

The scanning speed of two-photon imaging limited our ability to examine rapid dynamics of axon terminals. We next utilized AO-LLSM, which can adaptively correct for optical aberrations caused by the live brain tissues and enables noninvasive volumetric imaging at higher spatiotemporal resolution ( Chen et al., 2014 7.

To label the fine structure of single ORN terminals and to increase photostability of the fluorophore, we expressed membrane-targeted Halo-tag ( Kohl et al., 2014 29. Kohl, J. ∙ Ng, J. ∙ Cachero, S. ... Ultrafast tissue staining with chemical tags Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :E3805-E3814 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sutcliffe et al., 2017 52. Sutcliffe, B. ∙ Ng, J. ∙ Auer, T.O. ...

To capture rapid dynamics at different stages of development, we imaged every 30 s for 14.5 min ( Video S5 ) followed by a break of 1 h 45.5 min, repeating this procedure for 24 h ( Figure 4 A). The explant was cultured for another 24 h before fixing and counter-staining to reveal the glomerular type of labeled ORNs. The adaptive optics correction improved the spatial resolution of individual axon branches ( Figure 4 B), and in combination with fast imaging, allowed us to capture rapid changes of the fine structure in axon terminals ( Figure 4 C).

Fast dynamics of the exploring branches during target searching, related to Figure 4 The first segment shows exploring branches from two ORN axons (same as Figure 4C; the rightmost axon is unrelated). The second segment shows exploring branch from a single ORN axon in a different explant (same as Figure 4D). Dashed lines outline the shape of the antennal lobe. Max intensity projection image stacks taken every 30 s using AO-LLSM.
The enhanced spatiotemporal resolution of AO-LLSM confirmed that ipsilateral innervation occurred via interstitial branching from the contralaterally projecting axon after the growth cone passed the glomerulus for most ORN types ( Figure S6 A and green in Figures S6 C and S6D). In the few cases where i = 0 in our two-photon imaging study ( Figure 3 C), we found that the growth cone first innervated the glomerulus, followed by an interstitial branch growing toward the midline that eventually innervated the contralateral antennal lobe ( Figure S6 B, red in Figures S6 C and S6D). Thus, interstitial branching appears to be a universal rule of ORN axon branching.
When extending along the surface of the antennal lobe, ORN axon terminals usually exhibited simple, needle-like shape. However, we observed a multi-branched terminal structure when ORN axons approached their targets ( Figures 4 D and 4E; Video S5 ). We captured this multi-branched terminal in ∼40% of ORN axons imaged within the appropriate developmental stages, belonging to multiple ORN types ( Figure S6 E). Most observations in ipsilateral antennal lobe belonged to ORN types with relatively short waiting time of producing the ipsilateral branch ( i < 5 in Figure 3 C). Typically, 2–5 branches extended from a single axon ( Figure S6 F). We named these “exploring branches.” The exploring branches existed transiently before the axon reached the target ( Figures 4 D–4F, left) and disappeared soon after the axon terminal reached the target ( Figures 4 D–4F, right). At the target region, ORN axon terminals exhibited shorter branches we named “post-innervation branches” ( Figure 4 F, right). Exploring branches had longer lifetime than post-innervation branches ( Figure 4 G).
The high temporal resolution of AO-LLSM enabled us to analyze the dynamic features of each exploring branch or post-innervation branch. We selected strongly labeled axons and measured the length of each branch across time. Exploring branches had larger maximal length than post-innervation branches ( Figure 4 H). We categorized each 30-s imaging interval as extending or retracting if it was part of a time window when the branch continuously extended or retracted to more than 0.5 μm. Otherwise, we defined it as stationary. We separately quantified exploring branches, early post-innervation branches (the first 14.5-min imaging period after initial target innervation), and late post-innervation branches (4–6 h after early post-innervation branches) to assess if terminal dynamics change as the axons mature. The speed of extension and retraction, at 1.5–2 μm/min, were similar for both branches in all stages ( Figure 4 I). However, exploring branches spent more time extending or retracting than post-innervation branches, resulting in fewer stationary periods ( Figures 4 J and 4K). Moreover, extension and retraction in different branches of the same axon terminals appeared to be independent of each other ( Figure 4 K), supporting the notion that the behavior of each branch is determined by the microenvironment it samples. The late post-innervation branches exhibited the largest stationary periods, suggesting axon terminal branches become more stable as they mature. Although the exploring branches exhibited comparable extending and retracting periods, the post-innervation branches exhibited more retracting periods as they matured ( Figure 4 J). In rare cases when we captured the retraction of most branches within one fast imaging period, we found that different branches retracted asynchronously ( Figure S6 G).
In summary, AO-LLSM imaging allowed us to identify an unusual exploring branch structure prior to glomeruli innervation. Analysis of branch dynamics across different developmental stages revealed a shift of axon terminal branches from exploration mediated by both branch extension and retraction to a retraction-dominated pruning. A previous study showed that during Xenopus retinal axon arborization, the terminal arbor branching complexity is built by more protrusions being added than retracted over time ( Wong et al., 2017 58. Wong, H.H. ∙ Lin, J.Q. ∙ Ströhl, F. ... RNA Docking and Local Translation Regulate Site-Specific Axon Remodeling In Vivo Neuron. 2017; 95 :852-868.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ); this may correspond to an earlier stage of development than the late-stage post-innervation branches we analyzed.
Given the unusual structure and properties of the exploring branches, we next examined their cytoskeletal organization and compared with that of the post-innervation branches. In textbook depictions, the periphery or leading edge of the growth cone comprises finger-like protrusions called filopodia based on bundled F-actin, and flat, sheet-like protrusions called lamellipodia based on F-actin meshwork; microtubules fill the axon shaft that usually terminate at the center of the growth cone ( Figure 5 J, right; Sánchez-Soriano et al., 2010 46. Sánchez-Soriano, N. ∙ Gonçalves-Pimentel, C. ∙ Beaven, R. ... Drosophila growth cones: a genetically tractable platform for the analysis of axonal growth dynamics Dev. Neurobiol. 2010; 70 :58-71 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dent et al., 2011 9. Dent, E.W. ∙ Gupton, S.L. ∙ Gertler, F.B. The growth cone cytoskeleton in axon outgrowth and guidance Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3 :a001800 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although microtubules occasionally extend to the periphery of the growth cone, filopodia do not contain microtubules ( Dent et al., 2011 9. Dent, E.W. ∙ Gupton, S.L. ∙ Gertler, F.B. The growth cone cytoskeleton in axon outgrowth and guidance Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3 :a001800 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Deviating from the classic depictions of growth cones, which are mostly based on studies of dissociated neurons in culture, ORN axon terminals contained multiple thin protrusions (exploring branches or post-innervating branches) extending from a hub where the axon shaft ends ( Figures 4 C–4E and 5 A–5F), with no obvious lamellipodia between these terminal branches. To examine the cytoskeletal basis, we produced small MARCM clones of ORNs in which the plasma membrane was labeled by a membrane-targeting Halo-tag with Janelia Fluor 646 Halo-tag ligand in the media for explant culture, and F-actin or microtubules were labeled by genetically encoded markers described below, detected by antibody labeling post fixation. To define exploring branches in fixed brains, we selected multi-branched terminals approaching a similar region in the contralateral antennal lobe as the ipsilateral innervated glomeruli. To define post-innervation branches, we selected terminal branches extending from the end of the ipsilateral interstitial branch rather than from the contralaterally projecting axon.
To examine F-actin distribution in ORN axon terminals, we expressed the F-actin binding domain of utrophin tagged with GFP (GFP-utABD) ( Rauzi et al., 2010 43. Rauzi, M. ∙ Lenne, P.F. ∙ Lecuit, T. Planar polarized actomyosin contractile flows control epithelial junction remodelling Nature. 2010; 468 :1110-1114 Crossref Scopus (481) PubMed Google Scholar ). In exploring branches, F-actin was concentrated at the hub from which terminal branches emanate (open arrows in Figure 5 A), rather than the periphery of the growth cones. Indeed, most of the exploring branches did not contain detectable F-actin ( Figures 5 A, open arrowheads, and 5 G); a few branches contained discrete F-actin patches ( Figures 5 A, solid arrowheads, and 5 G). By contrast, most post-innervation branches were filled with F-actin throughout the entire branch ( Figures 5 B, solid arrows, and 5 G), whereas the rest of the post-innervation branches contained discrete F-actin patches ( Figures 5 B, solid arrowheads, and 5 G).
To examine microtubule distribution in ORN axons, we expressed GFP-tagged αTub84B ( Grieder et al., 2000 14. Grieder, N.C. ∙ de Cuevas, M. ∙ Spradling, A.C. The fusome organizes the microtubule network during oocyte differentiation in Drosophila Development. 2000; 127 :4253-4264 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) or GFP-tagged microtubule plus end-binding protein EB1 ( Rusan and Peifer, 2007 44. Rusan, N.M. ∙ Peifer, M. A role for a novel centrosome cycle in asymmetric cell division J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177 :13-20 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). The distribution of both markers suggested the presence of microtubules in both exploring branches and post-innervation branches (solid arrowheads in Figures 5 C–5F), as shown by discrete GFP-αTub84B signal ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and quantified in 5 H) and multiple EB1-GFP puncta along the branches ( Figures 5 E, 5F, and quantified in 5 I), including the branch tips ( Figure S6 H). The numbers of GFP-αTub84B fragments and EB1-GFP puncta were similar ( Figure 5 I). Both GFP-utABD and EB1-GFP were also found in terminals of pre-target ORN axons along the main trajectory ( Figures S6 I and S6J); the needle-like simple morphology of ORN axon terminals here did not allow finer distinction of F-actin and microtubule distributions.
In summary, the cytoskeletal organization of ORN axon terminals in the antennae-brain explants differed substantially from the growth cones of dissociated neurons in culture. The microtubule cytoskeleton appears to be a major component in both exploring and post-innervation branches. The post-innervation branches also contain more F-actin, which is most enriched at the hub from which both exploring and post-innervation branches emanate ( Figure 5 J).
Bilaterally symmetric axon targeting occurs widely ( Yost, 1998 62. Yost, H.J. Left-right development from embryos to brains Dev. Genet. 1998; 23 :159-163 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Corballis, 2009 8. Corballis, M.C. The evolution and genetics of cerebral asymmetry Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364 :867-879 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Swanson, 2011 53. Swanson, L.W. Brain Architecture: Understanding the Basic Plan Oxford University Press, 2011 Crossref Google Scholar ), but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown ( Lodato et al., 2015 36. Lodato, S. ∙ Shetty, A.S. ∙ Arlotta, P. Cerebral cortex assembly: generating and reprogramming projection neuron diversity Trends Neurosci. 2015; 38 :117-125 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taking advantage of the explant culture, we asked whether axon targeting of ORNs from one side (hereafter ipsilateral) requires the presence of ORN axons from the other side (hereafter contralateral) by severing the contralateral antennal nerve at specific developmental times ( Figure 6 A). Live imaging of sparsely labeled ORN axons showed that axons from the cut side immediately stopped growth and eventually degenerated, while uncut axons from the same explant continued to grow ( Figure 6 B).
With the FLPout-based sparse labeling strategy, we initiated explant culture after severing one antennal nerve at 18 h, 24 h, 30 h, and 34 h APF. At 18 h APF, pioneer ORN axons just reached the antennal lobe, such that severing the contralateral antennal nerve would prevent contralateral axons from entering the antennal lobe. This caused substantial targeting defects of ipsilateral ORN axons, including mistargeting dorsally out of the antennal lobe ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Contralateral antennal nerve severing at 24 h and 30 h APF caused ipsilateral ORN axons to target asymmetrically in two antennal lobes ( Figures 6 C and 6D), suggesting axon mistargeting on at least one side. However, contralateral antennal nerve severing at 34h APF no longer affected axon targeting specificity of most ipsilateral ORNs ( Figures 6 C and 6D). Asymmetric targeting of ipsilateral ORN axons upon contralateral antennal nerve severing was observed mostly in ORN types that had a short waiting time of the ipsilateral innervation ( Figures 3 C, small i , and S7 A).
To determine in which antennal lobe ipsilateral axons mistarget, we examined axon targeting of DM6 and DL4 ORNs upon contralateral antennal nerve severing at 30h APF. We found that the axons of both ORN types mistargeted only in the contralateral antennal lobe: DM6 axons mistargeted to a stereotyped position ventrolateral to the DM6 glomeruli ( Figure 6 E, solid arrows), whereas DL4 axons mistarget to more random glomeruli ( Figure 6 E, solid arrowheads). Thus, axons from contralateral ORNs are required for the correct target selection of ipsilateral ORNs in the contralateral antennal lobe.
Prior to ORN axon arrival, dendrites of their postsynaptic partner PNs are already present and at least some PN types already target their dendrites to specific regions of the antennal lobe ( Jefferis et al., 2004 26. Jefferis, G.S. ∙ Vyas, R.M. ∙ Berdnik, D. ... Developmental origin of wiring specificity in the olfactory system of Drosophila Development. 2004; 131 :117-130 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). Using the explant system, we first examined how PN dendrites target the correct regions. To label single PNs, we used GH146-GAL4 -based MARCM and heat shock in a time window when only DL1 single PN clones were labeled ( Jefferis et al., 2001 25. Jefferis, G.S. ∙ Marin, E.C. ∙ Stocker, R.F. ... Target neuron prespecification in the olfactory map of Drosophila Nature. 2001; 414 :204-208 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S7 C). Due to the low labeling intensity at early developmental stages, we could only visualize DL1 dendrites starting at ∼23 h APF, after they already innervated specific regions of the antennal lobe. At this stage, DL1 dendrites still exhibited active local exploration through terminal branch extension ( Figure 7 A, arrows; Video S6 ). These terminal dynamics decreased at 30 h APF when ORNs started to innervate the glomeruli and the dendritic terminals formed more smooth boundaries ( Figure 7 B; Video S6 ).

Does PN dendrite development depend on ORN axons? To address this question, we severed both antennal nerves at 20 h APF to ablate all ORN axons and compared the targeting of PN dendrites to those with intact antennal nerves ( Figure S7 B). We assessed targeting of a small subset of PN types labeled by two split GAL4 lines (Liu et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2021 60. Xie, Q. ∙ Brbic, M. ∙ Horns, F. ... Temporal evolution of single-cell transcriptomes of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons eLife. 2021; 10 :e63450 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S7 C). We found that PN dendrites remained in the same coarse regions of the antennal lobe after 24 h in explant culture in the absence and presence of the ORN axons ( Figures 7 E, 7F, and S7 D), suggesting that the maintenance of PN dendrites in specific regions of the antennal lobe does not require ORN axons.
However, when ORN axons were ablated, PN dendrites occupied larger areas compared to explants with intact ORN axons ( Figures 7 E, 7F, and S7 D). To quantify this effect, we measured the volumes split 15 -GAL4 + PN dendrites occupied under 4 conditions: 20 h APF and 30 h APF in vivo ( Figures 7 C and 7D), and 20 h APF + 24 h explant culture in the presence or absence of ORN axons ( Figures 7 E and 7F). Although the volumes of split 15 -GAL4 + dendrites remained similar at 20 h and 30 h in vivo ( Figure 7 G, light and dark blue bars), the antennal lobe volume increased by nearly 3-fold ( Figure 7 H); as a result, split 15 -GAL4 + PN dendrites occupied a smaller fraction of the antennal lobe volume ( Figure 7 I). These data suggest that PNs refine their dendrites as ORN axons invaded the antennal lobe. Dual color labeling directly showed that PN dendrites targeting to neighboring glomeruli gradually segregated from each other as development proceeded ( Figures S7 E–S7G), confirming dendritic refinement inferred above. When the explants were cultured in the presence of ORN axons, a similar expansion of the antennal lobe volume and PN dendrite refinement occurred after 24 h culture ( Figures 7 G–7I, light red bars). However, when the explants were cultured in the absence of ORN axons, antennal lobes no longer expanded, and PN dendrites occupied a larger fraction of antennal lobe volume than those cultured in the presence of ORN axons ( Figures 7 G–7I, dark red bars). These experiments indicate that ORN axons are required for PN dendrite refinement to a proportionally smaller region of the antennal lobe.

Section: Discussion

Prior to this study, it was unclear what cellular mechanism is used for ipsilateral target selection. Our data support the following model: ORN axons send out transient interstitial branches at multiple locations along the main axon; the branch that reaches the target region becomes stabilized, and further interstitial branches are suppressed ( Figures 3 and S5 A 3 ). Stabilization of appropriately positioned branches and elimination of ectopic branches are also used for topographic retinotopic targeting ( Yates et al., 2001 61. Yates, P.A. ∙ Roskies, A.L. ∙ McLaughlin, T. ... Topographic-specific axon branching controlled by ephrin-As is the critical event in retinotectal map development J. Neurosci. 2001; 21 :8548-8563 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; McLaughlin and O’Leary, 2005 37. McLaughlin, T. ∙ O’Leary, D.D. Molecular gradients and development of retinotopic maps Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28 :327-355 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the mechanism of transient interstitial branching followed by stabilization applies to the formation of both continuous and discrete neural maps.
The exploring branches we discovered using AO-LLSM imaging ( Figure 4 ) suggest a means by which a growing ORN axon may increase the chance of identifying its target. These exploring branches consist of long, microtubule-based parallel branches that extend and retract rapidly and independently, allowing them to sample a relatively large region for possible targets. The transient occurrence of exploring branches when ORN axons approach their target region suggests that they are induced by local cues near target regions to facilitate target selection. In the ipsilateral antennal lobe, exploring branches were found in ORN types that form ipsilateral branches shortly after the main axon passes by ( Figure 3 C, small i ), consistent with them serving as the precursor to the eventual ipsilateral branch. Exploring branches are also found in axon terminals in the contralateral antennal lobe in ORN types with a wide range of i (compare Figures 3 C and S6 E), suggesting a general role in facilitating contralateral target identification.
For ORN types that have a long delay in extending the ipsilateral branch ( Figure 3 C, large i ), we did not observe exploring branches, suggesting a distinct mechanism for consolidating the ipsilateral branch. Nevertheless, dynamic interstitial branches occur over a prolong period of time until the formation of the ipsilateral branch, suggesting that these ORN types also use stabilization of transient interstitial branches as a means to consolidate the ipsilateral branch.
In summary, after the initial trajectory choice such that ORN axons navigate in the half of the antennal lobe where their eventual targets are ( Joo et al., 2013 27. Joo, W.J. ∙ Sweeney, L.B. ∙ Liang, L. ... Linking cell fate, trajectory choice, and target selection: genetic analysis of Sema-2b in olfactory axon targeting Neuron. 2013; 78 :673-686 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A), we propose that the next critical step in ORN axon development is the stabilization of transient interstitial branches by target-derived cues, aided at least in part by the exploring branches. Together, these cellular mechanisms begin to explain how each ORN chooses one of 50 glomerular targets precisely.
A surprising finding is that the cytoskeletal organization of ORN terminals differs substantially from that of classic growth cones, comprising F-actin-based filopodia and lamellipodia at the periphery and a microtubule-enriched central hub. The terminal branches of ORN axons, in particular the exploring branches, are filled with microtubules, whereas F-actin is concentrated at the central hub ( Figure 5 ). We also found similar cytoskeletal organization in photoreceptor axon terminals ( Figures S6 K and S6L). These differences are unlikely due to species difference, as the classic growth cone cytoskeletal organization is found in neurons (mostly dissociated in culture) from Aplysia , Drosophila , and mammals ( Lin et al., 1994 34. Lin, C.H. ∙ Thompson, C.A. ∙ Forscher, P. Cytoskeletal reorganization underlying growth cone motility Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4 :640-647 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sánchez-Soriano et al., 2010 46. Sánchez-Soriano, N. ∙ Gonçalves-Pimentel, C. ∙ Beaven, R. ... Drosophila growth cones: a genetically tractable platform for the analysis of axonal growth dynamics Dev. Neurobiol. 2010; 70 :58-71 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dent et al., 2011 9. Dent, E.W. ∙ Gupton, S.L. ∙ Gertler, F.B. The growth cone cytoskeleton in axon outgrowth and guidance Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3 :a001800 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). We cannot rule out the possibility that F-actin is present in low amount at the terminal of each exploring or post-innervation branch but is beyond the detection limit of our utrophin-based F-actin labeling; if so, each terminal branch would have its own growth cone at its tip, resembling classic growth cones. Even if that is the case, ORN axon terminals still differ from classic growth cones by having multiple microtubule-based parallel branches emanating from an F-actin rich central hub. Indeed, EB1-GFP puncta can be found at the tip of the branch ( Figure S6 H), suggesting that microtubules can fill the entire branch. Microtubule polymerization has been shown to mediate membrane extension directly in lipid vesicle ( Fygenson et al., 1997 11. Fygenson, D.K. ∙ Marko, J.F. ∙ Libchaber, A. Mechanics of Microtubule-Based Membrane Extension Phys. Rev. Lett. 1997; 22 :769-781 Google Scholar ).
We suspect that the deviation of cytoskeletal organization in ORN axon terminals from the classic growth cone is likely due to the more complex environments axon terminals need to explore in the brain compared with the primary culture. Indeed, a recent study showed that neurons cultured in three-dimensional environments have microtubules extending to the edge of growth cones unconstrained by F-actin ( Santos et al., 2020 48.

Our findings have important implications for mechanisms that convert cell-surface recognition of extracellular cues into cytoskeletal-based structural changes in axon terminals during axon targeting. Specifically, we suggest that signaling to microtubule is particularly important at initial stages of target selection.
Bilaterally symmetric organization of the nervous system is a cardinal feature of all bilaterians ( Swanson, 2011 53. Swanson, L.W. Brain Architecture: Understanding the Basic Plan Oxford University Press, 2011 Crossref Google Scholar ). Our unilateral antennal nerve severing indicates the requirement of bilateral axons in target selection. The simplest cellular mechanism is direct interactions between ipsilateral and contralateral ORN axons. These interactions may facilitate midline crossing by creating a critical mass of midline-penetrating axons, disruption of which may cause some axons to leave the antennal lobe instead ( Figure 6 C). Later, bilateral axon-axon interactions between the same ORN types may facilitate target selection of contralateral ORNs. Our data do not rule out the possibility that bilateral interactions may be indirect; for example, ipsilateral ORNs may change the properties of their partners PNs, which in turn regulate target selection of contralateral ORNs. Indeed, upon unilateral antennal nerve severing, targeting defects was mostly found in ORN types that sequentially innervate ipsilateral and contralateral glomeruli ( Figure S7 A). The ease of severing antennal nerve in explant cultures provides a means to further investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms of bilateral interactions.
In conclusion, time-lapse imaging has greatly enriched our understanding of the cellular events that enable the stepwise assembly of the fly olfactory circuit, and highlight the precise genetic control of multiple steps during ORN axon targeting. These include the choice of a trajectory along which an ORN axon navigates the ipsilateral antennal lobe, the timing and location of stabilizing its ipsilateral branch, and the interactions with contralateral ORN axons to cross the midline and innervate its contralateral target. Finally, ORN axons also help refine dendrites of their partner PNs, which pattern the antennal lobe first. The stage is set to combine live imaging and the cellular insights it has brought with genetic manipulations of key wiring molecules identified by genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches to reach a deeper level of mechanistic understanding of the circuit assembly process.
Although the targeting precision in our explant culture mimics closely in vivo , it takes ORN axons longer to reach the same developmental stage in culture than in vivo ( Figure 1 ). Thus, measurements involving time in explants may be protractions of equivalent events in vivo . The small number of single axons from specific ORN types, due to limited drivers that label specific ORN types strongly in early development, did not allow us to assess the variation of targeting behavior among ORNs of the same type. Although we sampled axon targeting of a large fraction of antennal ORN types, we did not sample axons from 6 maxillary palp ORN types ( Figure S2 B) because our explant did not include maxillary palp. It is unclear whether maxillary palp ORN axons follow similar rules as antennal ORN axons. However, because maxillary palp ORN axons reach the antennal lobe substantially later than antennal ORN axons ( Sweeney et al., 2007 54. Sweeney, L.B. ∙ Couto, A. ∙ Chou, Y.H. ... Temporal target restriction of olfactory receptor neurons by Semaphorin-1a/PlexinA-mediated axon-axon interactions Neuron. 2007; 53 :185-200 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ), the lack of maxillary palp ORN axons in our explants should not affect the early stages of antennal ORN axon targeting.

The 0h APF pupae were identified by the white color of the cuticle of pupae. These pupae were heat-shocked in 37°C water bath for different amount of time to induce sparse clones (details indicated below) and aged at 25°C for specified hours before dissection. Dissection was done in pre-cooled Schneider’s insect media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Penicillim Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The external brown shells of the pupae were first removed using forceps. The micro dissection scissor was used to cut the trunk and remove the semi-transparent cuticle covering the dorsal and ventral sides of the brain. A small piece of cuticle attached to two retinae was left to hold the two antennae with the brain. Fat bodies were then cleaned through gentle pipetting. At this point the antennal nerves that connect the two antennae to the brain are visible and can be severed by the micro scissor in certain experiments ( Figures 6 and 7 ). After severing the antennal nerve(s), the antenna(e) were left attached to the small piece of cuticle during culture ( Figures 6 and 7 ). Following dissection, the antennae-brain explant was transferred to a culture dish (60 mm X 15 mm) with silgard layer on the bottom and 500 μL culture media. Two micro pins were used to pin the explant to the Silgard through the two optic lobes. The Silgard plate with explant was then carefully moved to the imaging station. 10 mL culture media was added gently to the plate before imaging. The culture condition for explant was modified from Ozel et al., 2015, containing: Schneider’s insect media (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 μg/ml human insulin recombinant zinc (from 4mg/ml stock solution, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 μg/ml 20-hydroxyecdysone (from 1 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol, Sigma), and Penicillin/streptomycin (1:100 from stock: 10000 IU/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The culture media was oxygenated by pumping oxygen for ∼30 min before use.
To generate FLPout reporters pUAS-FRT 100 -stop-FRT 100 -mCD8-GFP and pUAS-FRT 10 -stop-FRT 10 -mCD8-GFP constructs ( Figure 2 ), we PCR amplified the transcriptional terminator, stop, sequence from pUAST > stop > mCD8-GFP (addgene #24385) ( Potter et al., 2010 42.

Dissection and immunostaining of fly brains and pupal antennae were performed according to previously described methods ( Wu and Luo, 2006 59. Wu, J.S. ∙ Luo, L. A protocol for dissecting Drosophila melanogaster brains for live imaging or immunostaining Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :2110-2115 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2016 33.

The E3 ligase Ubr3 regulates Usher syndrome and MYH9 disorder proteins in the auditory organs of Drosophila and mammals eLife. 2016; 5 :e15258 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The brains were dissected in PBS (phosphate buffered saline; Thermo Fisher), and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS with 0.015% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes on a nutator at room temperature. Explant was fixed in the same condition after culture. Fixed brains were washed with PBST (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) four times, each time nutating for 20 minutes. The brains were then blocked in 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBST for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C on a nutator. Primary antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution and incubated with brains for 36–48 hours on a nutator at 4°C. After washed with PBST four times, each time nutating for 20 minutes, brains were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution and nutated in the dark for 36–48 hours at 4°C. Brains were then washed again with PBST four times, each time nutating for 20 minutes. Immunostained brains were mounted with Slow Fade anti-fade reagent (Thermo Fisher) and stored at 4°C before imaging. Primary antibodies used in immunostaining include: rat anti-DNcad (1:40; DN-Ex#8, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), chicken anti-GFP (1:1000; GFP-1020, Aves Labs), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, A-11122, Thermo Fisher Scientific), mouse anti-GFP (1:500, G6539, Sigma), rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, Clontech, 632475). Donkey secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488/568/647(Jackson ImmunoResearch or Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used at 1:1000.
Images of fixed brains were acquired by a Zeiss LSM 780 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss), with a 40x/1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil objective (Carl Zeiss). Confocal z stacks were obtained at 1–2 μm intervals at the resolution of 512x512. Images were exported as maximum projections or single confocal sections by ZEN (Carl Zeiss) in the format of TIFF. Photoshop (Adobe) was used for image rotation and cropping. Two-photon microscopy-based imaging was performed at room temperature using a custom-built two-photon microscope (Prairie Technologies), a Chameleon Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent) and a 20 × water-immersion objective (1.0 NA; Zeiss). For all two-photon microscopy-based imaging, the excitation wavelength was at 920 nm. Z stacks were obtained at 2 μm intervals. The pixel dwell time was 10 μs. Images were exported as maximum projections or single confocal sections by FIJI in the format of TIFF.
For AO-LLSM based imaging, the excitation and detection objectives along with the 25-mm coverslip were immersed in ∼40 mL of culture medium (see in Explant dissection and culture) at room temperature (22 ± 1°C). Explant brains with membrane targeting Halo-JF-646 expressed in sparse ORN clones were immobilized on a thin Sylgard layer (∼2 mm) attached to the surface of the coverslip using two pins and were excited using 642 nm lasers operating at ∼2–10 mW (corresponding to ∼10–50 μW at the back aperture of the excitation objective) with an exposure time of 20–50 msec. Dithering lattice light-sheet patterns with an inner/outer numerical aperture of 0.38/0.4 was used. The optical sections were collected by an axial step size of 250 nm in detection objective coordinate, with a total of 81–201 steps (corresponding to a total axial scan range of 20–50 μm). Emission light from JF-646 was captured by a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 sCMOS cameras (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Prior to the acquisition of the time series data, the imaged volume was corrected for optical aberrations using two-photon “guide star” based adaptive optics method. Each imaged volume was deconvolved in C++ using Richardson-Lucy algorithm on HHMI Janelia Research Campus’ computing cluster with experimentally measured point spread functions obtained from 200 nm fluorescent beads (Thermo Fisher). The AO-LLSM was operated using a custom LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Woburn, MA). Image analysis was performed using FIJI.
To sparsely label a few ORNs from any types using the FLPout reporters we generated in this study for time-lapse imaging ( Figure 2 ), we collected hsFLP/pebbled-GAL4;;UAS-FRT 100 -stop-FRT 100 -mCD8-GFP/+ pupae at 0h APF and heat shocked at 37°C for 40 min at 0h APF. These pupae were then aged at 25°C for 30h before explant dissection and two-photon imaging. To sparsely label a few ORNs with membrane targeting Halo-tag using MARCM ( Figure 4 ), we heat shocked pebbled-GAL4, FRT19A/tub-GAL80, hsFLP, FRT19A;;UAS-3xHalo7::CAAX/+ at 37°C for 30 min 2 days before puparium formation. We then collected these pupae at 0h APF and aged them at 25°C for 28h, followed by explant dissection, incubation with 2 μM Halo-JF-646 ( Grimm et al., 2017 15. Grimm, J.B. ∙ Brown, T.A. ∙ English, B.P. ... Synthesis of Janelia Fluor HaloTag and SNAP-Tag Ligands and Their Use in Cellular Imaging Experiments Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1663 :179-188 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) in 1 mL oxygenated culture media for 1h at room temperature. These explants were then incubated with 1μM Sulforhodamine 101 (Sigma) in 1ml culture media for 5 min at room temperature followed by two time washing in culture media before AO-LLSM based imaging in 50 mL culture media at room temperature. To induce DL1 PN clones, we heat-shocked yw, UAS-mCD8-GFP, hsFLP; FRTG13, GH146-FLP, UAS-mCD8-GFP/FRTG13, tubP-GAL80 at 37°C for 1 hour at approximately 0-4 hours after larval hatching ( Jefferis et al., 2004 26.

Developmental origin of wiring specificity in the olfactory system of Drosophila Development. 2004; 131 :117-130 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To quantify growth of ORN axons across time ( Figures 3 A and 3B), we measured the change of ORN axon curve length in the antennal lobe in each 20 min imaging interval and plotted to the timing of midline crossing. In the ipsilateral antennal lobe, we defined the last imaging scan before axons crossed the midline area as time 0. In the contralateral antennal lobe, we defined the first imaging scan after axons crossed the midline as time 0. To quantify the ipsilateral branching point ( Figures S5 B–S5D), L a was measured as the curve length from the antennal lobe entry point to ipsilateral branch point or the center of branching area in the main axon. L b was measured from the midline-axon crossing point to the ipsilateral branch point or the center of branching area in the main axon. The curve length of axons was measured using IMARIS. To describe the pattern of ipsilateral branches ( Figures S5 F and S5G), we drew the outlines of the branch terminals from the projection images. In the quantification of transient interstitial branches before and after ipsilateral innervation, the following ORN axons were not included in the quantification: VA1d and VA1v axons due to bundling together during targeting; VM2 and VM3 axons due to bundling together during targeting; VL2a, VL1 and VM4 axons due to innervation very close to the entry point in the ipsilateral antennal lobe. To analyze the fast dynamics of exploring branches and post-innervation branches, we measured the curve length of each branch across time using imageJ and categorized each 30 s imaging interval as extending or retracting if it was part of a time window when the branch continuously extended or retracted to more than 0.5 μm. Otherwise, we defined it as stationary. To calculate extending or retracting speed of each branch, we summed up total length increase or decrease during the 14.5 min fast scanning period and divided by the extending or retracting time period, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using t test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA or paired t test as indicated in the figure legend for each experiment using Excel.
To quantify PN dendritic segregation across development, we collected Mz19-Gal4/vvl-Flp;UAS-CD8 > GFP > RFP/+ pupae at 20h, 30h, and 48h APF, which had DA1 and VA1d/DC3 PNs labeled with CD8-GFP and CD8-RFP, respectively. Individual channels of each single plane image were subject to background subtraction using ImageJ, followed by conversion to binary data. The composite images were converted to RGB and the overlapping regions targeted by both DA1 and VA1d/DC3 PN dendrites were selected for area measurement. To measure the total area targeted by either PN dendrites or both, the images were further converted to 8-bit color containing two colors. The volumes targeted by either PN dendrites or both were calculated by summing up the volumes between neighboring sections by multiplying area in each section with section interval. The degree of PN dendritic segregation was determined by measuring the ratio of overlapping volume to total volume.
To determine the birth times for different ORN types, we heat-shocked pebbled-GAL4, FRT19A/tub-GAL80, hsFLP, FRT19A; UAS-mCD8-GFP/+ pupae at indicated time points for 25 min. The pupae were aged at 25°C. Adult brains were dissected from these heat shocked flies followed by immunostaining with anti-GFP and anti-N-cadherin antibodies and imaging by confocal microscopy. We quantified all single-cell MARCM clones (whose birthtimes reflect heat-shock times) from all dissected brains. To show the frequency of each type of ORN under certain heat shock condition, we normalized the total number of ORNs observed by the number of brains imaged and showed the number of single ORNs observed every 10 brains in Figure S3 D.
All statistical analyses were done using Excel. The statistical method and P value in each analysis were indicated in the figure legends. The numbers of analyzed samples (n) and SEMs are indicated in the figures or figure legends.
