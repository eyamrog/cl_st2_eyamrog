Title: Bacterial Vipp1 and PspA are members of the ancient ESCRT-III membrane-remodeling superfamily


Abstract: Summary

Membrane remodeling and repair are essential for all cells. Proteins that perform these functions include Vipp1/IM30 in photosynthetic plastids, PspA in bacteria, and ESCRT-III in eukaryotes. Here, using a combination of evolutionary and structural analyses, we show that these protein families are homologous and share a common ancient evolutionary origin that likely predates the last universal common ancestor. This homology is evident in cryo-electron microscopy structures of Vipp1 rings from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme presented over a range of symmetries. Each ring is assembled from rungs that stack and progressively tilt to form dome-shaped curvature. Assembly is facilitated by hinges in the Vipp1 monomer, similar to those in ESCRT-III proteins, which allow the formation of flexible polymers. Rings have an inner lumen that is able to bind and deform membranes. Collectively, these data suggest conserved mechanistic principles that underlie Vipp1, PspA, and ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodeling across all domains of life.

Section: Introduction

Various cytoskeletal elements, filaments, and membrane remodeling systems that were once viewed as the defining features of eukaryotic cells are now known to have a prokaryotic ancestry. Bacteria and some archaea have their own versions of tubulin (FtsZ), actin (MreB, FtsA, and ParM), intermediate filaments (Crescentin), and dynamins (BDLPs) ( Bohuszewicz et al., 2016 9.

Prokaryotic cytoskeletons: protein filaments organizing small cells Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16 :187-201 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). These proteins perform functions in prokaryotes that are often analogous to their eukaryotic counterparts including cell division, cell shape control, and membrane remodeling. What, though, about ESCRT-III proteins? Until recently, this major class of protein polymers was only known in eukaryotes where they form composite polymers ( Bertin et al., 2020 8. Bertin, A. ∙ de Franceschi, N. ∙ de la Mora, E. ... Human ESCRT-III polymers assemble on positively curved membranes and induce helical membrane tube formation Nat.

Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). ESCRT-III proteins are involved in multiple cell biological processes including multivesicular body formation, cytokinetic abscission, plasma membrane repair, nuclear envelope reformation, and viral budding ( McCullough et al., 2018 63. McCullough, J. ∙ Frost, A. ∙ Sundquist, W.I. Structures, Functions, and Dynamics of ESCRT-III/Vps4 Membrane Remodeling and Fission Complexes Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :25-42 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). The idea that these proteins were specific to eukaryotes changed with the discovery of ESCRT-III homologs in TACK archaea ( Lindås et al., 2008 55. Lindås, A.C. ∙ Karlsson, E.A. ∙ Lindgren, M.T. ... A unique cell division machinery in the Archaea Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :18942-18946 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ; Samson et al., 2008 80.

A role for the ESCRT system in cell division in archaea Science. 2008; 322 :1710-1713 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ), where they have been implicated in membrane scission during viral budding ( Liu et al., 2017 57.

Microbiol. 2017; 105 :540-553 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), extracellular vesicle formation ( Ellen et al., 2009 28. Ellen, A.F. ∙ Albers, S.-V. ∙ Huibers, W. ... Proteomic analysis of secreted membrane vesicles of archaeal Sulfolobus species reveals the presence of endosome sorting complex components Extremophiles. 2009; 13 :67-79 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and cell division ( Tarrason Risa et al., 2020 91. Tarrason Risa, G. ∙ Hurtig, F. ∙ Bray, S. ... The proteasome controls ESCRT-III-mediated cell division in an archaeon Science. 2020; 369 :eaaz2532 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). This, and the identification of even closer homologs of ESCRT-III proteins (and their regulators) encoded by the genomes of Asgard archaea, led to the suggestion that these eukaryotic signature proteins have an archaeal origin ( Spang et al., 2015 88. Spang, A. ∙ Saw, J.H. ∙ Jørgensen, S.L. ... Complex archaea that bridge the gap between prokaryotes and eukaryotes Nature. 2015; 521 :173-179 Crossref Scopus (574) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A unique feature of ESCRT-III polymers is their structural flexibility ( Nguyen et al., 2020 69. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), enabling them to form helical tubes, rings, spirals, filaments, cones ( Chiaruttini and Roux, 2017 21. Chiaruttini, N. ∙ Roux, A. Dynamic and elastic shape transitions in curved ESCRT-III filaments Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2017; 47 :126-135 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), and an array of structurally distinct composite polymers ( Huber et al., 2020 43. Huber, S.T. ∙ Mostafavi, S. ∙ Mortensen, S.A. ... Structure and assembly of ESCRT-III helical Vps24 filaments Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 :eaba4897 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ; McCullough et al., 2015 62. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ...

Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). As examples of this, the X-ray structure of Snf7 showed how an ESCRT-III protein packs to build a linear proto-filament ( Tang et al., 2015 90. Tang, S. ∙ Henne, W.M. ∙ Borbat, P.P. ... Structural basis for activation, assembly and membrane binding of ESCRT-III Snf7 filaments eLife. 2015; 4 :213 Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar ), while the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Vps24, and CHMP1B and IST1 co-polymers provided glimpses into the mechanisms by which ESCRT-III proteins self-assemble to form helical filaments with radically different lattices ( Huber et al., 2020 43. Huber, S.T. ∙ Mostafavi, S. ∙ Mortensen, S.A. ... Structure and assembly of ESCRT-III helical Vps24 filaments Sci.

Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because ESCRT-III polymers are implicated in the scission of membrane tubes from the inside during a wide array of cell biological processes, it is generally thought that they preferentially interact with negatively curved membranes. However, recent studies indicate that ESCRT-III proteins can also act on positively curved membranes in vitro ( Bertin et al., 2020 8. Bertin, A. ∙ de Franceschi, N. ∙ de la Mora, E. ... Human ESCRT-III polymers assemble on positively curved membranes and induce helical membrane tube formation Nat.

ESCRT-III is required for scissioning new peroxisomes from the endoplasmic reticulum J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :2087-2102 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). When acting on membranes with either topology ( Harker-Kirschneck et al., 2019 38. Harker-Kirschneck, L. ∙ Baum, B. ∙ Šarić, A.E. Changes in ESCRT-III filament geometry drive membrane remodelling and fission in silico BMC Biol. 2019; 17 :82 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), the AAA-ATPase Vps4 is thought to provide the energy required for membrane remodeling by driving stepwise changes in the composition and structure of ESCRT-III co-polymers ( Harker-Kirschneck et al., 2019 38. Harker-Kirschneck, L. ∙ Baum, B. ∙ Šarić, A.E.

Here, we identify PspA and Vipp1 proteins as members of the ESCRT-III superfamily. This is striking because these proteins share a common function in membrane remodeling. Thus, PspA functions in membrane stress response and repair in bacteria ( Brissette et al., 1990 10. Brissette, J.L. ∙ Russel, M. ∙ Weiner, L. ...

Like their ESCRT-III counterparts in eukaryotes, PspA and Vipp1 bind membranes and self-assemble as polymeric rings and tubes ( Aseeva et al., 2004 5. Aseeva, E. ∙ Ossenbühl, F. ∙ Eichacker, L.A. ...

In this study, we use cryo-EM to show that Vipp1 and PspA form ESCRT-III-like filaments and provide a mechanism for Vipp1-mediated membrane remodeling. This is in line with parallel work carried out by other groups ( Gupta et al., 2021 35. Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klumpe, S. ∙ Gries, K. ...

PspA adopts an ESCRT-III-like fold and remodels bacterial membranes Cell. 2021; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar , this issue of Cell ). Collectively, our data show that the wider ESCRT-III family of polymers, which includes Vipp1 and PspA, arose prior to the divergence of bacteria and archaea over 3 billion years ago and play common, conserved roles in membrane remodeling and repair across all domains of life.

Section: Results

To identify other as yet unknown ESCRT-III relatives, we used sensitive protein sequence searches based on Hidden Markov Models ( Zimmermann et al., 2018 110. Zimmermann, L. ∙ Stephens, A. ∙ Nam, S.-Z. ... A Completely Reimplemented MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit with a New HHpred Server at its Core J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 :2237-2243 Crossref Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins as search queries, PspA and Vipp1/IM30 families were identified as bacterial ESCRT-III homologs with high statistical support ( Figure S1 ; STAR Methods ). In addition to similarity in primary sequence, PspA, Vipp1, and ESCRT-III families were also found to share similar secondary structural elements with five core helices α1–α5. In addition, these proteins often possess an N-terminal helix α0 implicated in membrane binding ( Buchkovich et al., 2013 13. Buchkovich, N.J. ∙ Henne, W.M. ∙ Tang, S. ...

Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859 :28-39 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Otters et al., 2013 73. Otters, S. ∙ Braun, P. ∙ Hubner, J. ... The first α-helical domain of the vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 promotes oligomerization and lipid binding Planta. 2013; 237 :529-540 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a C-terminal extension termed helix α6 ( Figure 1 A).
To probe their tertiary structure, we used a co-evolutionary analysis ( Anishchenko et al., 2017 4. Anishchenko, I. ∙ Ovchinnikov, S. ∙ Kamisetty, H. ... Origins of coevolution between residues distant in protein 3D structures Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :9122-9127 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ovchinnikov et al., 2014 74. Ovchinnikov, S. ∙ Kamisetty, H. ∙ Baker, D. Robust and accurate prediction of residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information eLife. 2014; 3 :e02030 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). This identified high-scoring residues that co-vary in PspA/Vipp1 evolution within a key conserved ESCRT-III interface that forms between helix α5 and helices α1 and α2 ( Figure 1 B). For ESCRT-III, this tertiary and quaternary interaction functions both to maintain the protein in its auto-inhibited closed monomeric conformation ( Bajorek et al., 2009 7. Bajorek, M. ∙ Schubert, H.L. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Structural basis for ESCRT-III protein autoinhibition Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 :754-762 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) and to stabilize the open polymeric form following a helix α5 domain-swap between subunits ( McCullough et al., 2015 62. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ... Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, these data suggest that Vipp1 polymers may rely on similar contacts for their structural stability ( Figure 1 B).
We next looked at the wider evolution of the ESCRT-III/PspA superfamily. By mapping the presence or absence of different ESCRT-III homologs across the domains of life, it became clear that PspA/Vipp1 proteins are widely distributed across bacteria ( Figure 1 C). Conversely, CdvB/Chmp/Snf7-type proteins are found in all eukaryotes and in clusters of archaea, largely within Asgard and TACK superphyla ( Spang et al., 2015 88. Spang, A. ∙ Saw, J.H. ∙ Jørgensen, S.L. ... Complex archaea that bridge the gap between prokaryotes and eukaryotes Nature. 2015; 521 :173-179 Crossref Scopus (574) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 C). Moreover, this analysis identified a few additional CdvB/Chmp/Snf7-type ESCRT-III homologs in members of the Euryarchaeota, as previously reported ( Makarova et al., 2010 60. Makarova, K.S. ∙ Yutin, N. ∙ Bell, S.D. ... Evolution of diverse cell division and vesicle formation systems in Archaea Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :731-741 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, a number of PspA/Vipp1-type homologs were found within the euryarchaeal lineages Haloarchaea and Methanosarcinales ( Figure 1 C).
A phylogenetic analysis of the PspA, Vipp1, and ESCRT-III superfamily as a whole revealed a long branch separating the bacterial and archaeal/eukaryotic clades, with euryarchaeal ESCRT-III homologs branching near the base of the ESCRT-III subtree. The PspA/Vipp1 homologs found in Haloarchaea and Methanosarcinales are nested within the bacterial PspA clade and therefore appear to be relatively recent acquisitions by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Because CdvB/Chmp/Snf7-type proteins are widely distributed across archaea and eukaryotes, and PspA/Vipp1-type proteins are widely distributed across bacteria, this phylogeny ( Figure 1 D; Data S1 A and S1B) is consistent with the hypothesis that a single gene ancestral to PspA, Vipp1, and ESCRT-III was already present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).
Our evolutionary analysis also confirmed that Vipp1 likely arose from a pspA gene duplication ( Westphal et al., 2001 101. Westphal, S. ∙ Heins, L. ∙ Soll, J. ... Vipp1 deletion mutant of Synechocystis : a connection between bacterial phage shock and thylakoid biogenesis? Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :4243-4248 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is widely distributed among cyanobacteria and eukaryotic plastids derived from cyanobacteria. Interestingly, although most bacteria and archaea possess a single copy of PspA, Vipp1 tends to exist in multiple copies in cyanobacterial genomes ( Figure 1 E). This is a common feature of eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins ( Leung et al., 2008 54. Leung, K.F. ∙ Dacks, J.B. ∙ Field, M.C.

In addition, Euryarchaeota and Asgard archaea genomes encode multiple copies of ESCRT-III proteins ( Figure 1 F).
Finally, we mapped rate of evolutionary variance across both ESCRT-III and PspA family proteins using yeast Snf7 and Nostoc punctiforme Vipp1 as reference sequences. This analysis showed that both families share a similar evolutionary profile ( Figures 1 G and 1H) with well-conserved core secondary structure including the interface between helix α5 and helices α1 and α2 ( Figure 1 B). Because the regions C-terminal to helix α5 evolved much more rapidly, we were unable to detect homology between Snf7 and Vipp1. Thus, it is uncertain whether the common helical elements within the C termini of both families are homologous or the products of convergent evolution. This includes the MIM domain, which in archaeal and eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins physically associates with the AAA-ATPase Vps4 ( McCullough et al., 2018 63. McCullough, J. ∙ Frost, A. ∙ Sundquist, W.I. Structures, Functions, and Dynamics of ESCRT-III/Vps4 Membrane Remodeling and Fission Complexes Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 34 :85-109 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Overall, our evolutionary analyses show that PspA and Vipp1 are members of the ESCRT-III superfamily. To investigate whether this evolutionary conservation extends to structural similarities between the bacterial and eukaryotic members of the family, such as CHMP1B/IST1 and Snf7, we proceeded to carry out cryo-EM studies on a member of the bacterial branch of this ESCRT-III superfamily: N. punctiforme Vipp1.
For the structural analysis, full-length Vipp1/IM30 (amino acids 1–258, 28.7 kDa) from N. punctiforme was expressed in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion, purified by amylose affinity chromatography and then separated from MBP by TEV cleavage and size exclusion chromatography ( Figure S2 A). Negative stain (NS) EM analysis of Vipp1 revealed a remarkable array of polymeric assemblies ( Figure S2 B), including rings ( Figure S2 C), ring stacks, filaments ( Figures S2 D and S2E), and ribbons reminiscent of Vipp1 in other systems ( Aseeva et al., 2004 5.

For this study, we focused on Vipp1 rings because they have been widely reported from cyanobacteria through to plants ( Aseeva et al., 2004 5. Aseeva, E. ∙ Ossenbühl, F. ∙ Eichacker, L.A. ...

In order to determine their architecture, the sample was flash frozen on holey carbon grids for cryo-EM analysis. Because micrographs of Vipp1 in thin vitreous ice revealed preferential orientation bias, we mixed Vipp1 with pre-formed rat Dynamin 1 filaments before vitrification ( Sundborger et al., 2014 89. Sundborger, A.C. ∙ Fang, S. ∙ Heymann, J.A. ... A dynamin mutant defines a superconstricted prefission state Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :734-742 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) to thicken the ice layer around the Vipp1 particles to capture a wider array of side views ( Figure S2 C). Ultimately, 2D class averages of the Vipp1 rings revealed a spectrum of seven symmetries ranging from C11 to C17 ( Figure S2 F).
By reconstructing the C14 symmetry ring (Vipp1 C14 ), we achieved an overall resolution of 6.5 Å with highest resolution regions reaching 4.8 Å ( Figures S3 and S4 A; Table S1 ). This was sufficient to allow unambiguous assignment of the helical domains within the Vipp1 monomer and asymmetric unit and consequently the entire 2.4 MDa Vipp1 C14 ring containing 84 subunits ( Figures 2 and S4 B–S4D; STAR Methods ). To build the Vipp1 C14 monomer, a homology model was initially generated from the PspA crystal structure hairpin motif (aa 24–142). For these amino acids, PspA and Vipp1 share 32.5% sequence identity and 58% similarity with zero gaps, which indicates a conserved sequence register in this section ( Figures S4 E and S5 ). The Vipp1 hairpin homology model with its distinct axial twist closely fitted the Vipp1 C14 map and acted as an anchor from which to build the remaining main chain. Reconstructions were also generated for the other six symmetries and complete ring models built. Sizes ranged from the 1.6 MDa Vipp1 C11 ring with 55 subunits to the 3.4 MDa Vipp1 C17 ring with 119 subunits.
In order to validate these Vipp1 C11–C17 structures, the accuracy of the sequence register within the Vipp1 monomer was tested by cross-linking cysteine residues at opposing ends of the Vipp1 monomer (Vipp1 L86C/L193C and Figure 3 A). Consistent with Vipp1 C11–C17 structures, which position these residues at an inter-subunit contact with the cysteine sulfur atoms predicted ∼6 Å apart, clear dithiothreitol (DTT)-sensitive band shifts were observed for Vipp1 L86C/L193C in the presence of the oxidizing agent ortho-Cu(II)-phenanthroline (CuP) or the cross-linker MTS4 with a 7.8 Å span. Importantly, no equivalent band shifts were observed for the single cysteine mutants Vipp1 L86C or Vipp1 L193C .
In order to compare the structures of Vipp1 and ESCRT-III proteins, we followed the ESCRT-III nomenclature ( Figure S5 ; McCullough et al., 2015 62. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ...

Structural basis for activation, assembly and membrane binding of ESCRT-III Snf7 filaments eLife. 2015; 4 :213 Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar ). The hairpin motif, which is formed by helix α1 and conjoined helices α2/α3, was observed to be a conserved hallmark of Vipp1, PspA, and ESCRT-III proteins ( Figure 4 A). In addition, helix α4 was separated from hairpin helices α2/α3 by a linker region that corresponded to the ESCRT-III elbow ( McCullough et al., 2015 62.

Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Helix α5 was then angled from helix α4 in both Vipp1 and ESCRT-III proteins. In addition to these core common helices α1–α5 between Vipp1, CHMP1B, and other ESCRT-III polymers, the Vipp1 monomer includes an N-terminal helix α0 (aa 1–22) that extends perpendicular to the hairpin and mediates membrane binding in both PspA and Vipp1 systems ( Heidrich et al., 2016 39.

Helix α0 is not observed in CHMP1B, but it is shared by ESCRT-III proteins such as Vps2/CHMP2, Vps24/CHMP3, and Snf7/CHMP4, where it is reported to also mediate membrane binding ( Figures 1 A and S5 ; Buchkovich et al., 2013 13.

Cell. 2013; 27 :201-214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Vipp1 is distinguished from PspA by an additional C-terminal extension (aa 220–258) comprising a flexible linker and predicted helix α6 ( Zhang et al., 2016 108. Zhang, L. ∙ Kondo, H. ∙ Kamikubo, H. ... VIPP1 Has a Disordered C-Terminal Tail Necessary for Protecting Photosynthetic Membranes against Stress Plant Physiol. 2016; 171 :1983-1995 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the C-terminal extension has been shown to negatively regulate Vipp1 self-association in vivo ( Zhang et al., 2016 108. Zhang, L. ∙ Kondo, H. ∙ Kamikubo, H. ... VIPP1 Has a Disordered C-Terminal Tail Necessary for Protecting Photosynthetic Membranes against Stress Plant Physiol. 2016; 171 :1983-1995 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and might constitute a second lipid binding domain capable of modulating membrane fusion ( Hennig et al., 2017 41. Hennig, R. ∙ West, A. ∙ Debus, M. ... The IM30/Vipp1 C-terminus associates with the lipid bilayer and modulates membrane fusion Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 2015; 6 :7018 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), it did not yield a density in the Vipp1 C14 map, suggesting that this region is highly flexible ( Figures 4 A and S4 ). The same is true for C-terminal extensions in ESCRT-III proteins, which serve as flexible regulatory and/or protein-protein interaction domains ( McCullough et al., 2018 63. McCullough, J. ∙ Frost, A. ∙ Sundquist, W.I. Structures, Functions, and Dynamics of ESCRT-III/Vps4 Membrane Remodeling and Fission Complexes Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 34 :85-109 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Vipp1 C14 rings are assembled from six rungs stacked on top of each other ( Figure 2 A). Each rung differs in conformation so that an asymmetric dome-shaped curvature is achieved when rings are viewed from the side. Rungs are maximally constricted at the top and bottom with internal lumen diameters of 14 nm and 15.7 nm, and widest at the ring equator between rungs 3 and 4 with an internal diameter of 17.5 nm ( Figures 2 A and 2B). This unique asymmetric curvature is a feature of all Vipp1 C11–C17 ring symmetries ( Figure 2 B).
Within each rung, Vipp1 subunits form a staggered polymer with subunit j contacting neighboring subunits j +1 and j +3 ( Figure 4 B). Hairpin motifs pack side by side so that helices α1, α2, and α3 of subunit j form an extended interface underneath the hairpin of neighboring subunit j +1. Concurrently, the helix α5 C terminus (α5C) of subunit j binds across the hairpin tip of subunit j +3 forming a contact termed here Interface 1. Importantly, similar hairpin stacking and the equivalent hairpin/helix α5 interface is observed within the CHMP1B filament between subunit j and subunit j +4 ( Figure 4 B; McCullough et al., 2015 62. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ... Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nguyen et al., 2020 69. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). The hairpin-helix α5 contact constitutes a domain swap in polymerized CHMP1B that is also observed in other ESCRT-III proteins ( Huber et al., 2020 43. Huber, S.T. ∙ Mostafavi, S. ∙ Mortensen, S.A. ... Structure and assembly of ESCRT-III helical Vps24 filaments Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 :eaba4897 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interface 1 is conserved and was predicted for Vipp1 by our co-evolutionary and rate of variance analyses ( Figures 1 B, 1G, and S5 ). To probe the contribution of Interface 1 in polymer assembly, Vipp1 truncations were generated by removing either the helix α6 C-terminal extension (Vipp1Δα6 1–219 ) or helices α5 and α6 (Vipp1Δα5/6 1–191 ). Based on the Vipp1 C11–C17 models, where helix α5C is positioned at the tip of the spike ( Figure 2 A), α6 helices likely coat the ring outside surface and do not contribute directly to polymer formation. Accordingly, both native Vipp1 and Vipp1Δα6 1–219 formed rings and filaments as assayed using gel filtration and NS EM. By contrast, both ring and filament formation was abolished in the Vipp1Δα5/6 1–191 mutant ( Figure 3 B-D). These results indicate that helix α5 and Interface 1, both of which are conserved in ESCRT-III systems, are essential for Vipp1 filament and ring assembly.
The basic building block (or asymmetric unit) of Vipp1 C14 is a stack of six monomers, each one located in a different rung, which when repeated forms a ring ( Figure 5 A). Intriguingly, the six subunits within each asymmetric unit have distinct conformations, which is made possible by three hinge regions that provide Vipp1 with conformational versatility ( Figure 5 B; Videos S1 , S2 , and S3 ). The hinges are located at the C terminus of helix α2 (hinge 1 or shoulder) between helix α3 and α4 (hinge 2 or elbow) and between helix α4 and α5 (hinge 3 or wrist). Within each ring, the flex in subunit structure is progressive, curling the ends of the asymmetric unit to give rise to the dome-shaped curvature. Importantly, similar subunit flexibility is seen in ESCRT-III, where the equivalent hinge regions are used to enable polymers to assume different filament lattices, curvatures, and to drive helical filament constriction ( Nguyen et al., 2020 69. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ; Huber et al., 2020 43. Huber, S.T. ∙ Mostafavi, S. ∙ Mortensen, S.A. ... Structure and assembly of ESCRT-III helical Vps24 filaments Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 :eaba4897 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). We note that hinge 1 has not previously been reported yet accounts for ∼6° of the observed flexibility in both Vipp1 and CHMP1B, albeit along a different axis ( Figure 5 B).

Within Vipp1 rings, each rung associates with its neighbor through just four interfaces. At the Vipp1 N terminus, helices α0 stack axially so that they line the ring lumen (termed Interface 2), where they are well positioned to bind membrane ( Figures 2 A, 5 A, and S4 A). As well as binding rungs together, Interface 2 also serves as a fulcrum mediating the sequential tilting of each helix α0 that defines the curvature of the ring lumen ( Figure 5 A). Interface 3 forms between the N terminus of helix α5 (α5N) and the hairpin tip from the rung below ( Figure 6 A). Although the amino acids implicated in Interface 3 are highly conserved in both Vipp1 and PspA family members, they are missing in ESCRT-III proteins, which do not possess an α5 N-terminal helical extension ( Figure S5 ). The remaining inter-rung contacts, Interfaces 4 and 5, form smaller packing interfaces between helix α4 and helix α2 and between hinge 2 and helix α1, respectively ( Figure 6 A). As dome-shaped curvature increases toward the top of the ring, helix α5 rotates from being oriented at 40° relative to the horizontal in rung 5 ( Figures 6 B and S6 A) to a maximum of 80° in rung 2. Due to Interfaces 1 and 3, the two hairpins bound to helix α5 co-rotate with the effect that they are pulled inward pivoting around Interface 2 ( Figure S6 B). This suggests the hypothesis that rung stacking causes lattice tension to build until a maximum bending limit is reached. At this point, additional bound subunits cannot flex sufficiently to form Interface 1 and/or 3, impeding further rung stacking.
To test whether the dome-shaped curvature observed in Vipp1 rings depends on a combination of inter-rung contacts and geometric constraints, as suggested by these data, an idealized elastic-network model of the Vipp1 C11 ring was constructed. First, an “average rung” was defined that represented the average shape of a single isolated Vipp1 C11 rung. Then, we defined interactions between neighboring rungs based on the contacts between rungs 3 and 4 of the Vipp1 C11 structure ( Figures 2 B and 6 C). Finally, Vipp1 rings were initialized as cylindrical stacks of between 2 and 10 average rungs, which were then minimized subject to the elastic network ( Video S4 ). The model rings formed Vipp1-like dome-shaped curvature with helix α5 rotation (Δϕ i ) increasing with rung distance from the ring equator ( Figure 6 D). Strikingly, the cumulative helix α5 rotation (Δϕ) between all rung interfaces plateaued near 40°, indicating a strict geometrical bending limit. Remarkably, this maximal rotation within the simulated stacks closely matched the measured experimental Δϕ in Vipp1 C11 ( Figure 6 E), as well as the cumulative ∼40° helix α5 rotations observed for Vipp1 C14 ( Figure 6 B). Thus, the simulations suggest a simple self-regulatory mechanism for limiting ring stack size where stress from inter-rung rotation builds up until the formation of Interfaces 1 and 3 is no longer favorable beyond a geometrical limit of ∼40°, after which further stacking is impeded. Consistent with this, Interfaces 1 and 3 linking the top two rungs were poorly resolved in Vipp1 C11–C17 rings, indicating a weak interaction once the limiting geometry is reached. To test the importance of Interface 3 for dome-shaped curvature formation, we mutated two conserved residues, F197K and L200K (Vipp1 F197K/L200K ), within this interface. Although this severely inhibited self-assembly, indicating that Interface 3 was important for both rung formation and ring stability, a minor fraction of Vipp1 F197K/L200K still formed rings and filaments. Strikingly, these filaments tended to have a broadly uniform diameter along their length consistent with a loss of inter-rung tilt ( Figure S7 A). These data suggest that Interface 3 forms a tensile connection between rungs that facilitates the formation of dome-shaped rings.

Energy minimized elastic-network model of Vipp1 forms Vipp1-like dome-shaped rings, related to Figure 6C–6E The initial structure is a C11 stack composed of eight identical and energy minimized rungs that contains no inter-rung interactions. Inter-rung interactions were added and the movie traces elastic energy minimisation. The equilibrium structure reached is a dome-shaped structure that balances the inter-rung rotation favored by the inter-rung interactions with the overall distortion in each rung.6
As well as rings, we observed native Vipp1 and Vipp1Δα6 1–219 proteins to form multiple types of polymeric assemblies including filaments ( Figures S2 B, S2D, and S7 C). Fourier Bessel analysis suggested that Vipp1 filaments are helical with variable diameters and lattices. For the 14-nm diameter filament, one of the dominant layer lines corresponds to a 30.5 Å repeat, which fits closely to the average axial rise between hairpins within neighboring rungs ( Figures 5 and S2 D). Given the Vipp1 subunit is >16 nm in length when maximally curved, significant conformational changes or lattice rearrangements may be required to build the 14 nm filament. In this case, Vipp1 may be forming a filament similar to ESCRT-III Vps24, which constitutes a 16-nm diameter double-stranded filament ( Huber et al., 2020 43.

Vipp1 stack arrays were also observed morphing from discrete rings into ribbons then filaments, particularly with Vipp1Δα6 1–219 ( Figure S7 C). Overall, these micrographs indicate that Vipp1 and Vipp1Δα6 1–219 can transition between lattices in an extraordinary display of assembly versatility reminiscent of ESCRT-III filaments ( Bertin et al., 2020 8.

To determine how N. punctiforme Vipp1 rings interact with lipids, we first used a spin pelleting assay to demonstrate binding to E. coli liposomes ( Figure S7 E). We then directly observed the interplay between Vipp1 and liposomes by NS EM. Vipp1 rings decorated the liposome surface ( Figures 7 A and S7 F). Side views of Vipp1 bound to liposome edges clearly showed the rings attached to the membrane surface. Tilt and side views, which were only observed associated with a liposome edge, also revealed how dome-shaped rings preferentially attach to the membrane via their wider opening rather than their sides. This suggests that helix α6, which coats the outer surface of the ring, does not mediate membrane binding in this instance ( Hennig et al., 2017 41. Hennig, R. ∙ West, A. ∙ Debus, M. ... The IM30/Vipp1 C-terminus associates with the lipid bilayer and modulates membrane fusion Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 2017; 1858 :126-136 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ring stacks were often observed protruding from liposome edges ( Figure S7 F), together with cones that formed from stacks of rings with decreasing diameters. Rings, stacks, and cones also formed tethers that connected liposomes via their openings ( Figures 7 A and S7 F). In support of a role for the ring lumen in membrane binding, when we added Vipp1 polymers to E. coli lipid monolayers ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S7 G–S7I), rings were only observed bound to the monolayer via their openings. Intriguingly, these rings often had occluded lumens demarcated by white centers ( Figure 7 C), consistent with a model in which the monolayer was adsorbed onto the inner ring wall forming an encapsulated vesicle-like bud that excludes the negative stain. This model was further supported by side views of Vipp1 rings attached to liposomes in vitreous ice where the positive curvature of the lipid bilayer surface was remodeled to form an open neck of negative curvature as the membrane enters the Vipp1 ring base ( Figures 7 D and 7E).

Section: Discussion

Here, we show that Vipp1, PspA, and ESCRT-III constitute an ancient superfamily of related membrane remodeling proteins that are conserved across archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Excitingly, this adds ESCRT-III to the growing list of universal cytoskeletal proteins, like actin and tubulin ( van den Ent et al., 2001 94. van den Ent, F. ∙ Amos, L. ∙ Löwe, J. Bacterial ancestry of actin and tubulin Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4 :634-638 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ), which, although once thought to be defining features of eukaryotes, are now known to have their origins in prokaryotes. Further studies are required to determine which features of these ESCRT-III-like polymers (including archaeal PspA, euryarchaeal ESCRT-III-like proteins, as well as bacterial Vipp1/PspA) are generic and which are likely to be domain-, phylum-, or species-specific. For example, it is not clear whether the ATPase PspF ( Data S1 C; Elderkin et al., 2005 27. Elderkin, S. ∙ Bordes, P. ∙ Jones, S. ... Molecular determinants for PspA-mediated repression of the AAA transcriptional activator PspF J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187 :3238-3248 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) performs a similar role to Vps4 in the control of PspA-dependent membrane remodeling nor whether there is an equivalent ATPase that assists Vipp1 in its membrane remodeling activities.
In addition to homology between PspA/Vipp1 and ESCRT-III at the primary amino acid sequence level ( Figure S1 ), our analyses show that Vipp1 homologs share a similar secondary structure ( Figure 1 A) and overall fold with ESCRT-III proteins ( Figure 4 A). Furthermore, when polymerized, Vipp1 shares core assembly features with ESCRT-III polymers like CHMP1B ( McCullough et al., 2015 62. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ... Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nguyen et al., 2020 69. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ... Membrane constriction and thinning by sequential ESCRT-III polymerization Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), which includes regions of flex that allow both polymers to assume different forms ( Figure 5 ). Notably, Vipp1 contains a similar hairpin motif, elbow, and wrist joints (hinges 2 and 3) as reported for CHMP1B ( McCullough et al., 2015 62. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ... Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nguyen et al., 2020 69.

Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Vipp1 and CHMP1B also share a shoulder joint located at the C terminus of helix α2 (hinge 1). Collectively, these conserved hinges enable the polymers to assume forms that differ widely in curvature and tilt, including a broad variety of complex 3D structures ( Bertin et al., 2020 8. Bertin, A. ∙ de Franceschi, N. ∙ de la Mora, E. ... Human ESCRT-III polymers assemble on positively curved membranes and induce helical membrane tube formation Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2663 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pfitzner et al., 2020 76. Pfitzner, A.-K. ∙ Mercier, V. ∙ Jiang, X. ... An ESCRT-III Polymerization Sequence Drives Membrane Deformation and Fission Cell. 2020; 182 :1140-1155.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, both Vipp1 and CHMP1B form polymers through side-by-side packing of the hairpin motif and through helix α5 contacting the hairpin of neighboring subunits j +3 or j +4, respectively. This helix α5 contact, which forms Interface 1, is conserved in multiple ESCRT-III proteins and represents a defining feature that explains how this superfamily of proteins generates polymers.
Although both Vipp1 and ESCRT-III proteins form helical filaments, here, we have focused our analysis on the architecture of seven 1.6–3.4 MDa Vipp1 rings from the cyanobacterium N. punctiforme . The analysis of different ring symmetries, ranging from C11–C17, provides us with a view of the structural flexibility that enables Vipp1, PspA, and ESCRT-III family members to perform their functions. Furthermore, as each ring comprises between 5–7 rungs stacked together to build a dome-shaped architecture, these asymmetric structures provide us with a glimpse of the structural features that enable filament tilt in the context of an ESCRT-III-like polymer. This is important because simulations have shown that filament tilt may facilitate ESCRT-III transition from a planar spiral to a three-dimensional cone to generate force and drive membrane deformation ( Harker-Kirschneck et al., 2019 38. Harker-Kirschneck, L. ∙ Baum, B. ∙ Šarić, A.E.

Although the physiological role of Vipp1 within the cell is not fully understood, the results of many cell biological studies indicate that this protein family functions to mitigate stress in photosynthetic membranes ( Bryan et al., 2014 11.

In addition, some studies have shown that Vipp1 can seal and repair leaky membranes in vitro ( Junglas et al., 2020 47. Junglas, B. ∙ Orru, R. ∙ Axt, A. ...

Similarly, the closely related bacterial PspA is known to mediate inner membrane repair in response to stress ( Joly et al., 2010 45. Joly, N. ∙ Engl, C. ∙ Jovanovic, G. ...

Although the previous reconstructions of both Vipp1 and PspA rings ( Hankamer et al., 2004 37. Hankamer, B.D. ∙ Elderkin, S.L. ∙ Buck, M. ...

They also provide a mechanism for Vipp1-mediated membrane curving and tubulation. When membrane was modeled into the Vipp1 C11–C17 structures as a 4-nm bilayer, sequential constriction was observed with the membrane lumen reaching ∼3 nm within Vipp1 C11 ( Figure 7 F). This is close to the biophysical limit required to induce membrane fusion/fission ( Chernomordik et al., 1995 19. Chernomordik, L. ∙ Kozlov, M.M. ∙ Zimmerberg, J. Lipids in biological membrane fusion J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146 :1-14 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Kozlovsky and Kozlov, 2003 51. Kozlovsky, Y. ∙ Kozlov, M.M. Membrane fission: model for intermediate structures Biophys. J. 2003; 85 :85-96 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our biochemical experiments also suggest how Vipp1 rings might help seal membrane breaches or local bilayer perturbations ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S7 G) by binding to membranes through the lumenal amphipathic α0 helices ( Heidrich et al., 2016 39. Heidrich, J. ∙ Wulf, V. ∙ Hennig, R. ...

The first α-helical domain of the vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 promotes oligomerization and lipid binding Planta. 2013; 237 :529-540 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). As membrane is drawn into the Vipp1 ring lumen via capillary action ( Figure 7 D and 7E), since Vipp1 rings are most constricted at their top, the membrane will become increasingly squeezed as it ascends so that breached or perturbed membrane leaflets could converge to a point of stabilization or fusion at the ring apex ( Figure 7 G). Although it is not clear how ESCRT-III polymers repair membrane ( Jimenez et al., 2014 44. Jimenez, A.J. ∙ Maiuri, P. ∙ Lafaurie-Janvore, J. ... ESCRT machinery is required for plasma membrane repair Science. 2014; 343 :1247136 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sønder et al., 2019 87. Sønder, S.L. ∙ Boye, T.L. ∙ Tölle, R. ... Annexin A7 is required for ESCRT III-mediated plasma membrane repair Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :6726 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), the Vipp1 structures suggest a potential mechanism for ESCRT-III polymers acting in this role when bound to the outside of positively curved membranes. Such capillary action could also explain the entry of lipids into the central lumen of pre-formed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Vipp1 helical filaments ( Theis et al., 2019 92. Theis, J. ∙ Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klingler, J. ... VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It is also possible that ensembles of Vipp1 ring-like structures mediate more complex membrane remodeling events similarly to ESCRT-III polymers ( Bertin et al., 2020 8. Bertin, A. ∙ de Franceschi, N. ∙ de la Mora, E. ... Human ESCRT-III polymers assemble on positively curved membranes and induce helical membrane tube formation Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2663 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nguyen et al., 2020 69. Nguyen, H.C. ∙ Talledge, N. ∙ McCullough, J. ...

An ESCRT-III Polymerization Sequence Drives Membrane Deformation and Fission Cell. 2020; 182 :1140-1155.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). This could be achieved by ring stacking, cone, or filament formation, which could support the establishment of membrane tubules ( Figure 7 G). It is possible that such structures tether and bridge opposed membranes ( Figures 7 A and S7 F) as a precursor to membrane fusion as has been reported in vitro ( Hennig et al., 2015 40. Hennig, R. ∙ Heidrich, J. ∙ Saur, M. ... IM30 triggers membrane fusion in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7018 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 41.

In any bridging event, it is possible that Vipp1 rings, stacks, or filaments extend from both opposing membranes so that a seam of opposing handedness is created where the polymers meet, as was observed in C. reinhardtii Vipp1 protein-lipid tubes ( Theis et al., 2019 92. Theis, J. ∙ Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klingler, J. ... VIPP1 rods engulf membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8725 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In summary, our study shows that PspA, Vipp1, and ESCRT-III constitute an ancient membrane repair/remodeling machine that was likely present in the last universal common ancestor of all cells (LUCA). Building on this evolutionary insight, our structural analysis of Vipp1 reveals the conserved architecture of these proteins, including three hinge regions. Such architecture provides these polymers with the flexibility required to remodel membrane across all domains of life.
The N. punctiforme Vipp1 C11–C17 models ( Figure 2 ) are broadly consistent with concurrently reported Synechocystis Vipp1 and PspA structures ( Gupta et al., 2021 35. Gupta, T.K. ∙ Klumpe, S. ∙ Gries, K. ...

PspA adopts an ESCRT-III-like fold and remodels bacterial membranes Cell. 2021; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar , this issue of Cell ). Future cryo-EM studies using N. punctiforme Vipp1 may facilitate higher resolution maps to be resolved with improved accuracy of main chain position and showing side chain detail. Although Vipp1 rings and filaments have been purified from cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, it is still unclear how these polymers relate to cellular Vipp1 forms and membrane remodeling activities. Note similar difficulties arise when trying to reconcile the in vitro structures of ESCRT-III polymers associated with membranes ( McCullough et al., 2015 62. McCullough, J. ∙ Clippinger, A.K. ∙ Talledge, N. ... Structure and membrane remodeling activity of ESCRT-III helical polymers Science. 2015; 350 :1548-1551 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nguyen et al., 2020 69.

Biol. 2020; 27 :392-399 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) with their in vivo functions, where in many cases these same proteins are known to function in the reverse topology. Finally, it remains uncertain whether Vipp1 functions as a composite co-polymer with Vipp2 and/or is remodeled via its association with an external ATPase, analogous to the way ESCRT-III polymers work. These outstanding questions represent an exciting frontier for future studies.

To search for ESCRT-III relatives, we used sensitive protein sequence searches (HHMER [ Finn et al., 2011 30. Finn, R.D. ∙ Clements, J. ∙ Eddy, S.R. HMMER web server: interactive sequence similarity searching Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 :W29-37 Crossref Scopus (2444) PubMed Google Scholar ], HHPred [ Zimmermann et al., 2018 110.

The Pfam protein families database in 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D427-D432 Crossref Scopus (1608) PubMed Google Scholar ]) based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Several individual eukaryotic ESCRT-III proteins, multiple sequence alignments and HMM profiles were used as queries in these searches. These analyses consistently identified PspA/Vipp1 proteins as the only ESCRT-III homologs in sequence, domain and structural databases (Uniprot [ UniProt Consortium, 2019 93. UniProt Consortium UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D506-D515 Crossref Scopus (2391) PubMed Google Scholar ], GenBank [ Sayers et al., 2019 82.

RCSB Protein Data Bank: biological macromolecular structures enabling research and education in fundamental biology, biomedicine, biotechnology and energy Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D464-D474 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ]). This observation was corroborated by the fact that these protein families share a common Pfam clan which only includes PspA and ESCRT-III (Pfam CL0235). Secondary structure predictions were performed using HHPred ( Zimmermann et al., 2018 110. Zimmermann, L. ∙ Stephens, A. ∙ Nam, S.-Z. ...

Biol. 2018; 430 :2237-2243 Crossref Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar ), Phyre2 ( Kelley et al., 2015 49. Kelley, L.A. ∙ Mezulis, S. ∙ Yates, C.M. ... The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :845-858 Crossref Scopus (4534) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Psipred ( Buchan and Jones, 2019 12. Buchan, D.W.A. ∙ Jones, D.T. The PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench: 20 years on Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W402-W407 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ) software. To obtain a statistical model of the PspA/Vipp1 family that captures patterns of residue co-evolution, Gremlin ( Anishchenko et al., 2017 4. Anishchenko, I. ∙ Ovchinnikov, S. ∙ Kamisetty, H. ...

Robust and accurate prediction of residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information eLife. 2014; 3 :e02030 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used. For this analysis, a total of 2844 homologous proteins were obtained using N. punctiforme Vipp1 as a query, four iterations of JackHHMER searches, E-value ≤ 1e-10, using a coverage filter of 50% and gap removal of 75%.
The phylogenetic distribution of the PspA/Vipp1 and ESCRT-III families was generated using AnnoTree ( Mendler et al., 2019 66. Mendler, K. ∙ Chen, H. ∙ Parks, D.H. ... AnnoTree: visualization and exploration of a functionally annotated microbial tree of life Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :4442-4448 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) searches in Pfam ( El-Gebali et al., 2019 26. El-Gebali, S. ∙ Mistry, J. ∙ Bateman, A. ... The Pfam protein families database in 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D427-D432 Crossref Scopus (1608) PubMed Google Scholar ) and an E-value ≤ 1e-05. Over 27000 bacterial and 1500 archaeal genomes were analyzed. For the generation of a phylogenetic tree of the Vipp1-ESCRT-III superfamily, homologs of these proteins were retrieved from Uniprot ( UniProt Consortium, 2019 93. UniProt Consortium UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D506-D515 Crossref Scopus (2391) PubMed Google Scholar ) by HMMER ( Finn et al., 2011 30. Finn, R.D. ∙ Clements, J. ∙ Eddy, S.R. HMMER web server: interactive sequence similarity searching Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 :W29-37 Crossref Scopus (2444) PubMed Google Scholar ) searching and from InterPro ( Mitchell et al., 2019 67. Mitchell, A.L. ∙ Attwood, T.K. ∙ Babbitt, P.C. ... InterPro in 2019: improving coverage, classification and access to protein sequence annotations Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D351-D360 Crossref Scopus (619) PubMed Google Scholar ) database, followed by manual inspection. Eukaryotic, archaeal and bacterial PspA and ESCRT-III proteins were selected to achieve a broad distribution of homologs across the tree of life. In total, 264 PspA and 332 ESCRT-III sequences were selected, aligned using the l-INS-I mode in mafft 7.3.1 ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 48. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (15340) PubMed Google Scholar ), and poorly-aligned regions were identified and removed using the “gappyout” mode in trimAl 1.3 ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 15. Capella-Gutiérrez, S. ∙ Silla-Martínez, J.M. ∙ Gabaldón, T. trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1972-1973 Crossref Scopus (3146) PubMed Google Scholar ). The phylogeny was inferred in IQ-Tree 1.6.10 ( Nguyen et al., 2015 68. Nguyen, L.-T. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ von Haeseler, A. ... IQ-TREE: a fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating maximum-likelihood phylogenies Mol. Biol. Evol. 2015; 32 :268-274 Crossref Scopus (5705) PubMed Google Scholar ) under the LG+C30+G+F model, which was the best-fitting model according to the BIC criterion. This model accounts for differences in exchange rates among amino acids (LG), different site compositions (C30+F), and models across-site rate variation using a discretized Gamma distribution with 4 rate categories. Branch supports are ultrafast (UFBoot2 [ Hoang et al., 2018 42. Hoang, D.T. ∙ Chernomor, O. ∙ von Haeseler, A. ... UFBoot2: Improving the Ultrafast Bootstrap Approximation Mol. Biol. Evol. 2018; 35 :518-522 Crossref Scopus (1551) PubMed Google Scholar ]) bootstraps. The same steps above were used for the generation of the phylogenetic tree of ATPases, with the only differences being that 194 ATPase sequences were selected and the best-fit model chosen by BIC was LG+R8, i.e., with across-site rate variation modeled using a mixture of eight rates that were not constrained to be drawn from a Gamma distribution. Site-specific evolutionary rates, measured in units of expected number of substitutions per site, were inferred using the empirical Bayes method in IQ-TREE (–rate) from subfamily-specific (ESCRT-III and PspA/Vipp1) sequence alignments. The analysis of the number of copies per genome of PspA/Vipp1 and ESCRT-III/Snf7 genes were performed inspecting a variable number of genomes per taxonomic group, using HHMER searches and the following proteins as queries (species and protein name, Uniprot code): PspA/Vipp1 - 133 bacterial genomes ( N. punctiforme Vipp1, B2J6D9; this analysis excludes cyanobacterial genes), 421 archaea ( Haloferax volcanii PspA, D4GUW2), 180 eukaryotes containing chloroplasts ( C. reinhardtii Vipp1, A8JC26), 502 cyanobacteria ( N. punctiforme Vipp1, B2J6D9); ESCRT-III/Snf7 - 40 Euryarchaeota ( Halomicrobium mukohataei ESCRT-III-like, C7P4W4), 13 Asgard archaea ( Candidatus Odinarchaeota archaeon LCB_4 Vps2/24/46 and Vps20/32/60 homologs, A0A1Q9N7Y8 and A0A1Q9N7Y5) and 165 TACK archaea ( Sulfolobus acidocaldarius CdvB, Q4J924).
Plasmid mutagenesis and all clones were generated using the Gibson isothermal DNA assembly protocol ( Gibson et al., 2009 34. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.-Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (4371) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Table S2 . The coding sequence for N. punctiforme vipp1 (Uniprot code B2J6D9) was cloned into pOPTM (a pET derivative) to yield an N-terminal MBP fusion with a TEV cleavage site in the linker. An N-terminal hexahistidine tag was included on the MBP moiety. For the purification of both native and mutant Vipp1, clones were co-transformed into E. coli C43 (DE3) electro-competent cells (Lucigen) modified to incorporate a pspA gene knockout using a Lambda Red recombinase strategy ( Chernyatina and Low, 2019 20. Chernyatina, A.A. ∙ Low, H.H. Core architecture of a bacterial type II secretion system Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5437 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 24. Datsenko, K.A. ∙ Wanner, B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :6640-6645 Crossref Scopus (10199) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were grown on selective LB-agarose plates with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). 2xYT media was inoculated and cells grown at 37°C until induction at OD 600 = 0.8 with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were grown for ∼15 h at 18°C and shaken at 220 rpm. All the further steps were carried out at 4°C unless otherwise specified. Purification of Vipp1 L86C , Vipp1 L193C and Vipp1 L86C/L193C were performed in the presence of 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Pellets were re-suspended in ice-cold buffer 50 mM Tris- HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, treated with 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and sonicated on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h with 10 mL of amylose resin (NEB) pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Tris- HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl (wash buffer). The resin was washed with 100 mL and purified MBP-Vipp1 eluted with wash buffer supplemented with 15 mM maltose. The sample was incubated for 24 h at room temperature with TEV and then dialysed (12-14 kDa MW cut-off) overnight in 25 mM Tris- HCl pH 8.4, 40 mM NaCl. The sample was concentrated and injected onto a sephacryl 16/60 S500 gel filtration column equilibrated in 25 mM Tris- HCl pH 8.4, 50 mM NaCl. A typical elution profile for Vipp1 consisted of three peaks containing 1) Vipp1 superstructures such as filaments eluting at ∼40 mL within the column size exclusion limit or void volume, 2) Vipp1 rings eluting at ∼65 mL, 3) non-polymerized low molecular weight Vipp1 species consistent with monomer or dimers, MBP and TEV eluting at ∼100 mL. Fractions from peak 1 and 2 were pooled and concentrated up to 1 mg/mL. Where necessary, the sample was gel filtrated a second time to reduce residual MBP or TEV contamination. LC-MS/MS confirmed the identity of the Vipp1 band identified by SDS-PAGE. Note that native Vipp1 migrates at ∼38 kDa and not at its expected molecular weight of 28.7 kDa. As Vipp1Δα5/6 1-191 gel filtrates only in peak 3, the removal of MBP and TEV was necessary for a clean SDS-PAGE analysis. An additional affinity chromatography step was therefore included directly before gel filtration using 2 × 5 mL HisTraps (GE Healthcare). As both the MBP and TEV proteins incorporate a hexahistidine tag, the flow through containing Vipp1Δα5/6 1-191 was collected for subsequent steps.
The rat dynamin 1 gene (Uniprot code P21575) with the PRD domain truncated was cloned into pOPTM vector yielding an N-terminal MBP fusion with a TEV cleavage site in the linker. A C-terminal hexahistidine tag was included on Dynamin 1. E. coli thioredoxin was inserted at the Dynamin 1 N terminus through Gibson assembly. The role of the thioredoxin, which was not cleaved off, was to stop the large-scale clumping of Dynamin 1 filaments in solution and to facilitate a broad distribution of filaments on the EM grid. Transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown on selective LB-agarose plates with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). 2xYT media was inoculated and cells grown at 37°C until induction at OD 600 = 0.6 with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were grown for ∼15 h at 19°C and shaken at 220 rpm. All the further steps were carried out at 4°C unless otherwise specified. For purification, pellets were re-suspended in 50 mM Tris- HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA and sonicated on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 98,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min and the supernatant loaded onto a self-packed column with ∼10 ml of amylose resin (NEB) pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Tris- HCl pH 9.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol (wash buffer). The resin was washed with 200 mL of wash buffer and the MBP-Dynamin 1 eluted with wash buffer supplemented with 15 mM maltose. The sample was incubated overnight at room temperature with TEV and the products separated by gel filtration using a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S300 column in buffer 20 mM Tris- HCl pH 9.0, 1mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT. Fractions of Dynamin 1 were concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.
Under cryogenic conditions N. punctiforme Vipp1 exhibits significant preferred orientation so that essential side views for determining the structure were absent. To solve this issue, preformed Dynamin 1 filaments with 37 nm diameter were mixed with Vipp1 prior to vitrification. Rat Dynamin 1 filaments appear equivalent to human Dynamin 1 filaments in the super constricted state ( Sundborger et al., 2014 89. Sundborger, A.C. ∙ Fang, S. ∙ Heymann, J.A. ... A dynamin mutant defines a superconstricted prefission state Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :734-742 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Dynamin 1 filaments formed a network on the grid that helped to maintain ice thickness around Vipp1 rings so that positioning at the air-water interface was reduced and side views captured. 37.5 μM Dynamin 1 was incubated with 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 2mM GMPPCP and 5 mM MgCl 2 at room temperature for 2 hours to form filaments. 35 μM Vipp1 was then mixed with the pre-formed dynamin filaments. 4 μL of the mixture was incubated for 30 s on glow discharged holey R2/2 Quantifoil grids before vitrification in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). Data were collected at 300 kV on a Titan Krios (M02 beamline at eBIC Diamond, UK) equipped with a Gatan Quantum K2 Summit detector. 3206 movies were acquired at a magnification of 35,971 yielding 1.39 Å/pixel using EPU software. Defocus was between −1.25 and −3.0. Movies were dose-weighted over 40 frames with 10 s exposures. Total dose was 50 e/Å 2 .
Individual movie frames were aligned with MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 109. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (1982) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the contrast transfer function estimated using CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 78. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (1286) PubMed Google Scholar ). All subsequent processing was carried out using Relion 3.0 ( Scheres, 2012 83. Scheres, S.H.W. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (2316) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were picked manually to generate initial 2D class averages that were subsequently used for reference-based auto-picking. Extracted particles were subjected to five rounds of 2D classification resulting in a cleaned stack of 109,715 particles. To generate the initial 3D model, a subset of 2D classes comprising C14 symmetry top views and side views with diameter range from 28 nm to 32 nm were selected (24,355 particles). 3D classification was carried out in C1 using a featureless hollowed cylinder as the initial reference. One class containing 9,991 particles yielded a ring with distinct C14 symmetry, which was chosen for high-resolution reconstruction first. These particles were then 3D autorefined with C14 symmetry applied reaching 8.5 Å resolution. The resulting map (Intermediate map 1) showed clear secondary structure features and was used as the new C14 reference volume for a second round of processing. In round two, side views only of 2D class averages were selected and 3D classified iteratively in C1 using Intermediate map 1 as a reference volume. In this way 15,767 side views with C14 symmetry were isolated. These side views were combined with 3,663 C14 top view particles obtained during 2D classification. A 3D autorefinement was undertaken with C14 symmetry applied to yield a reconstruction at 7.0 Å resolution (Intermediate map 2). Individual particles were then corrected for beam-induced motion for a third round of processing. One round of 3D classification was undertaken in C1 using Intermediate map 2 as the reference volume. A final stack of 17,114 particles was then used for 3D autorefinement with C14 symmetry applied reaching 6.8 Å resolution. Post-processing yielded 6.5 Å resolution with an auto-estimated B-factor ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 79. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1104) PubMed Google Scholar ) of −291.9 Å 2 applied to sharpen the final 3D map. Resolutions reported are based on gold standard Fourier shell correlations (FSC) = 0.143. Once the Vipp1 C14 structure was built and targeted masks of asymmetric units or individual rungs could readily be generated, multiple subtraction based local refinements including symmetry expansion strategies were attempted but no improvement in resolution was observed. A similar strategy as implemented for Vipp1 C14 was carried out to generate all other ring symmetries including Vipp1 C11-C13 and Vipp1 C15-C17 . A B-factor of −320 Å 2 was applied to these maps. The hand of the electron density maps was unambiguously determined by fitting the PspA crystal structure (PDB: 4WHE ), which has a distinct axial twist and asymmetry. Statistics for data collection and 3D refinement for all maps are included in Table S1 .
Rung 3 of the Vipp1 C14 structure was built first. A secondary structure prediction was obtained using Psipred ( Buchan and Jones, 2019 12. Buchan, D.W.A. ∙ Jones, D.T. The PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench: 20 years on Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W402-W407 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ). A partial Vipp1 homology model based on PspA (PDB: 4WHE ) was generated using I-Tasser ( Zhang, 2008 104. Zhang, Y. I-TASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9 :40 Crossref Scopus (3462) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was trimmed to include amino acids 24-142, which represents the hairpin motif. Importantly for obtaining an accurate sequence register in the Vipp1 structure, Vipp1 aligns robustly with PspA in this region with 32.5% sequence identity, 59% similarity and crucially 0% gaps. The hairpin readily fitted into the Vipp1 C14 map requiring only minor adjustments. Overall, the hairpin from Vipp1 C14 rung number 3 (PDB: 6ZW4 ) and PspA hairpin motifs have a Cα RMSD = 2.2 Å ( Figure S4 E). The hairpin homology model provided an important anchor for subsequently building the N-terminal helix α0 and C-terminal helices α4 and α5. The resolution for the bulk of Vipp1 C14 within rungs 3 and 4 was ∼5 Å so that the main chain could be easily traced and helices α0-α5 clearly assigned and built using COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 29. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (14143) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significant attention was paid to regions of high sequence conservation as a guide for sequence register within predicted interfaces. Similarly, our co-evolutionary contact maps ( Figure 1 B) were used to confirm interfaces and expected sequence register. Ultimately, the accuracy of the sequence register was experimentally assessed by the introduction of a cysteine pair within Interface 3 and tracking cross-links ( Figure 3 A). Rosetta ( Wang et al., 2016 100. Wang, R.Y.-R. ∙ Song, Y. ∙ Barad, B.A. ... Automated structure refinement of macromolecular assemblies from cryo-EM maps using Rosetta eLife. 2016; 5 :e17219 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to improve the geometry. The subunit from rung 3 was copied and rigid body fitted into all other rungs within the asymmetric unit using Chimera Fit in map command ( Pettersen et al., 2004 75. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (22421) PubMed Google Scholar ). COOT and ISOLDE ( Croll, 2018 23. Croll, T.I. ISOLDE: a physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to adjust for rung specific conformational changes. Using PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (14351) PubMed Google Scholar ), non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) was applied to each asymmetric unit to generate a complete Vipp1 C14 84 chain model. This model was truncated to main chain and rigid body and B factor refined in PHENIX. For all other ring symmetries, the Vipp1 C14 asymmetric model was fitted using Chimera Fit in map command. COOT and ISOLDE ( Croll, 2018 23. Croll, T.I. ISOLDE: a physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to adjust for conformational changes specific to ring symmetry. For each ring, NCS was applied to generate complete ring models. All subsequent steps were as for Vipp1 C14 . The final models were assessed using Molprobity and statistics outlined in Table S1 ( Chen et al., 2010 17. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (8561) PubMed Google Scholar ). The correlation between map and model (CC mask ) as generated by the phenix.map_model_cc command was C11- 0.8, C12- 0.82, C13- 0.77, C14- 0.84, C15- 0.8, C16- 0.67, C17- 0.58.
For Vipp1 F197K/L200K and Vipp1Δα6 1-219 filaments ( Figures S7 A–S7D), a dataset comprising 100 and 121 micrographs, respectively, were collected manually on a Tecnai F20 microscope equipped with Falcon II direct electron detector. Single frames were collected with 1 s exposure, total dose ∼15 e/A 2 , a magnification of 68,293 and a pixel size = 2.05 Å. For Vipp1 F197K/L200K , using the helical processing module in Relion 3.1, 20,745 segments were extracted and binned to a final pixel size = 6.15 Å. After 2D classification, an aligned stack from a selected class average was created containing 780 segments. The stack was summed using Imagic ( van Heel et al., 1996 95. van Heel, M. ∙ Harauz, G. ∙ Orlova, E.V. ... A new generation of the IMAGIC image processing system J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :17-24 Crossref Scopus (1027) PubMed Google Scholar ), padded in Ximdisp ( Smith, 1999 86. Smith, J.M. Ximdisp--A visualization tool to aid structure determination from electron microscope images J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125 :223-228 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ImageJ used for Fourier Transform analysis ( Schneider et al., 2012 84. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (26826) PubMed Google Scholar ). For Vipp1Δα6 1-219 , 20,745 segments were extracted and binned to a final pixel size = 6.15 Å. 226 segments were used for the aligned stack and subsequent processing. For native Vipp1 14 nm and 24 nm filaments ( Figures S2 D and S2E), 14,292 segments were extracted from the Vipp1 ring dataset and binned to a final pixel size = 4.17 Å. 9820 and 429 segments contributed to the final class average for the 14 nm and 24 nm filaments, respectively.
To understand the relationship between inter-rung stacking and the creation of dome-shaped curvature in Vipp1 rings, molecular modeling was used focused on the smallest ring system- Vipp1 C11 for simplicity. Each residue was represented by a single bead at the position of the Cα atom. The potential energy of the structure was defined by an elastic network model (ENM), meaning that interactions between residues nearby in the experimental structure were restrained by harmonic springs. Nearby in the contact map was defined by Cα distances within 10 Å. All springs were given the same stiffness.
The elastic network for each rung was identical, both internally (intra-rung) and in the interactions made with the rungs above it and below it (inter-rung). While the experimental Vipp1 C11 structure enforced each monomer to be identical within a rung, the monomers between rungs showed small differences. To create the intra-rung network, the contact map for all monomers in rungs with a complete structure (11 ∗ 4 monomers in Vipp1 C11 rungs 2-5) was compared and a spring was created for each contact provided it existed in > 50% of the monomers. As the conformational changes in the monomers between different rungs are small, only a few contacts were removed in this process. Those removed were localized to the regions showing the largest shifts between rungs, namely Hinges 2 and 3 within the Vipp1 monomer ( Figure 5 B). Removing these outlier contacts allows the network to better model the inherent flexibility of the Vipp1 monomer. Note that the intra-rung contacts included contacts between monomers within the same rung. The natural length of each spring was defined as the average of its contact distances over the monomers. In this way, an ENM for an average rung was created. The average rung best matched rung 3, with a Cα RMSD of 0.5 Å. The inter-ring contact map was defined by the interactions between Vipp1 C11 rungs three and four ( Figure 2 B) as rung 5 at the bottom is incomplete.
We then computed the equilibrium structure for different stack sizes by minimizing the elastic energy. This minimization was performed by molecular dynamics (MD) at a low temperature followed by a steepest decent minimization. SMOG2 ( Noel et al., 2016 70. Noel, J.K. ∙ Levi, M. ∙ Raghunathan, M. ... SMOG 2: A Versatile Software Package for Generating Structure-Based Models PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12 :e1004794 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the template “ENM” was used to create topology files for the MD software GROMACS ( Abraham et al., 2015 1. Abraham, M.J. ∙ Murtola, T. ∙ Schulz, R. ... GROMACS: High performance molecular simulations through multi-level parallelism from laptops to supercomputers SoftwareX. 2015; 1-2 :19-25 Crossref Scopus (6004) Google Scholar ) using the Vipp1 C11 PDB structure as input (PDB: 6ZVR ). These topology files were processed as described in the previous paragraph. Initial structures for minimization were created in VMD by manually copying rung three and translating it N times, where N is the desired number of rungs.
The equilibrium structures resulted from balancing the competing effects of 1) the inter-rung interactions driving curvature and 2) the geometrical constraints of doming. While in principle some of the strain could be alleviated by breaking links, this is not allowed in the ENM. This constraint is not present in the experimental system, which may explain why map densities for parts of the upper and lower rungs are less resolved. The rotations between rungs in the equilibrium structures were analyzed by measuring the angle formed by helix α5 with the ring central axis ( Figures 6 B and 6C). The axis is defined by the z axis in the experimental structure. The line along the direction of helix α5 is defined by two points taken as the centers of mass of residues 194-202 and residues 211-219.
DTT was removed from 1 mg/mL Vipp1 L86C , Vipp1 L193C or Vipp1 L86C/L193C using PD MiniTrap G-25 columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mM Tris- HCl pH 8.4, 50 mM NaCl. Samples were diluted to 5 μM and incubated with either 10 mM DTT, ortho-Cu(II)1,10-phenanthroline (CuP, stock 10 mM in 20% ethanol) or 5 μM 1,4-Butanediylbismethanethiosulfonate (MTS-4, stock 50 mM in chloroform) for 1 h at room temperature. Vipp1 L86C/L193C cross-linked samples were rescued with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at room temperature. Non-reacted cysteines were blocked by the addition of 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, stock 0.5 M in 100% ethanol). Samples were evaluated by SDS-PAGE.
Liposomes were prepared using E. coli total lipid extract (Avanti polar lipids, US). Lipid extract was dissolved in chloroform at 25 mg/mL in a glass vial (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chloroform was evaporated and the lipid dried for 1 h in a vacuum desiccator. The residual lipid film coating the bottom of the vial was hydrated using liposome reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 and 80 mM KCl) at a concentration of 6 mg/ml. The lipid was resuspended by vortexing and gentle sonication with a needle tip for 2 min on ice. The suspension was extruded through polycarbonate membranes with 1 or 0.2 μm pore size using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) to create large or small unilamellar vesicles (LUV/SUV). LUV and SUV were stored at 4°C for subsequent use.
Liposome binding assays were performed by incubating freshly prepared 2 mM SUV with and without purified 5 μM Vipp1 for 2 h at room temperature in liposome reaction buffer. For negative stain EM, 5 μL of each sample was loaded onto glow-discharged 200-mesh carbon coated copper grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate (UA). Images were acquired using a FEI Tecnai Spirit microscope equipped with a 2 K Eagle camera. For cryo-EM, 4 μL of sample was loaded onto plasma-cleaned ultrathin lacey carbon supported grids (Agar Scientific) and incubated for 90 s before vitrification in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). Cryo-EM images were collected manually on a Tecnai F20 microscope equipped with Falcon II direct electron detector. Single frames were collected with 1 s exposure, total dose ∼15e/A 2 , a magnification of 109,375 and a pixel size = 1.28 Å.
To detect Vipp1 membrane binding a spin assay was used. 10.5 μM Vipp1 was ultra-centrifuged at 50,000 x g at 20°C for 15 min using a TLA100 rotor to remove any initial aggregation. The supernatant from this first spin was collected and incubated with and without 2 mg/ml LUV for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were subjected to a second spin at 30,000 x g at 20°C for 30 min. The pellet (P) and the supernatant (S) were harvested, made up to equal volumes in LDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Lipid monolayers were prepared using E. coli total lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids). A custom-made Teflon block containing 4 mm x 4 mm diameter wells were filled with 50 μL of assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 and NaCl 50 mM). A 5 μL drop of 0.1 mg/ml lipid dissolved in chloroform was applied to the top of the buffer solution and the chloroform left to evaporate for 1 h. A non-glow discharged carbon coated copper grid was gently placed on top of the lipid layer with the carbon side faced toward the lipid layer. Subsequently, 14 μM Vipp1 was injected into the well using a side port. The control wells containing either monolayer (no protein) or protein only (a drop of chloroform but no lipid) were set up in parallel. Samples were incubated for 2 h before grids were recovered and immediately stained with 2% UA and imaged using a FEI Tecnai Spirit microscope equipped with a 2 K Eagle camera. Images were taken at a magnification of 40,059 and 3.37 Å pixel size. 263 and 156 images were collected of Vipp1 with and without lipid monolayer, respectively, as described above. Gctf1.06 ( Zhang, 2016 105. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (1297) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for estimating the contrast transfer function. Processing steps including particle picking and extraction, and 2D classification were carried out using Relion 3.1 ( Scheres, 2012 83. Scheres, S.H.W. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (2316) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final class averages were generated from stacks comprising 11,972 and 2,165 particles for Vipp1 with and without lipid monolayer.
In Figures S3 C–S3I and Table S1 , the resolution of the Vipp1 C11-C17 cryo-EM maps was derived from the FSC = 0.143 criterion ( Chen et al., 2013 18. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ).
