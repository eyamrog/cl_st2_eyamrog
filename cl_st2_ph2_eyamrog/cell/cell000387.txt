Title: B cell genomics behind cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV


Abstract: Summary

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a focus in vaccine and therapeutic design to counteract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants. Here, we combined B cell sorting with single-cell VDJ and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and mAb structures to characterize B cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. We show that the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire consists of transcriptionally distinct B cell populations with cells producing potently neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) localized in two clusters that resemble memory and activated B cells. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of selected nAbs from these two clusters complexed with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers show recognition of various receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes. One of these mAbs, BG10-19, locks the spike trimer in a closed conformation to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the recently arising mutants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and SARS-CoV and cross-reacts with heterologous RBDs. Together, our results characterize transcriptional differences among SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and uncover cross-neutralizing Ab targets that will inform immunogen and therapeutic design against coronaviruses.

Section: Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third zoonotic betacoronavirus to cause a human outbreak after SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ( de Wit et al., 2016 17. de Wit, E. ∙ van Doremalen, N. ∙ Falzarano, D. ... SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :523-534 Crossref Scopus (1486) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks, limited numbers of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated using phage display library techniques ( Prabakaran et al., 2006 67. Prabakaran, P. ∙ Gan, J. ∙ Feng, Y. ... Structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor-binding domain complexed with neutralizing antibody J. Biol.

An efficient method to make human monoclonal antibodies from memory B cells: potent neutralization of SARS coronavirus Nat. Med. 2004; 10 :871-875 Crossref Scopus (517) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since then, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of B cells has allowed simultaneous characterization of their clonal landscape and associated transcriptional profiles ( Neu et al., 2019 61. Neu, K.E. ∙ Guthmiller, J.J. ∙ Huang, M. ... Spec-seq unveils transcriptional subpopulations of antibody-secreting cells following influenza vaccination J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :93-105 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). When combined with functional testing and structural characterization of selected mAbs, this integrated approach should allow us to learn more about transcriptional pathways involved in the generation of efficient antiviral antibody (Ab) responses and the roles of different B cell subpopulations ( Horns et al., 2020 30.

Recent efforts to develop therapeutic mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 were aided by structures that have revealed how the SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor ( Yan et al., 2020 112. Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ...

Structures of Human Antibodies Bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Reveal Common Epitopes and Recurrent Features of Antibodies Cell. 2020; 182 :828-842.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ), and commonalities among receptor-binding domain (RBD)-binding mAbs ( Barnes et al., 2020a 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tortorici., 2020 92.

Yuan, M. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Wu, N.C. ... Structural basis of a shared antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, these structures guide choices of mAb pairs for treatment cocktails, while informing structure-based engineering experiments to improve mAb potencies and/or resistance to viral mutations. Furthermore, recent mapping of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 mAbs that target conserved spike epitopes ( Lv et al., 2020 50. Lv, Z. ∙ Deng, Y.Q. ∙ Ye, Q. ... Structural basis for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by a potent therapeutic antibody Science. 2020; 369 :1505-1509 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Piccoli et al., 2020 65.

Here, we use scRNA-seq to investigate SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B cell responses in 14 subjects who had recovered from COVID-19. We matched the VDJ sequence and transcriptional profiles with functional studies from 92 mAbs and identified two transcriptional clusters (TCs) from which the majority of neutralizing Abs (nAbs) were isolated. We structurally characterized six of the most potently nAbs derived from B cells in these two TCs, including BG10-19 that reaches between adjacent RBDs on a single spike trimer, locking it in a conformation that cannot bind ACE2 in a manner distinct from previously described mAbs ( Barnes et al., 2020a 2.

Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms Science. 2020; 370 :950-957 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). BG10-19 potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2, the United Kingdom (UK) variant B.1.1.7 ( Davies et al., 2021 16. Davies, N.G. ∙ Abbott, S. ∙ Barnard, R.C. ... Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and the South African variant B.1.351 ( Tegally et al., 2020 86.

Emergence and rapid spread of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage with multiple spike mutations in South Africa medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) as well as the heterologous SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses. Furthermore, characterization of mAbs belonging to the VH3-53/VH3-66 -encoded class ( Barnes et al., 2020b 3. Barnes, C.O. ∙ West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Huey-Tubman, K.E. ...

Section: Results

To understand the development of B cell responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we enrolled 14 subjects who had recently recovered from COVID-19. Subjects were diagnosed in March 2020, none required hospitalization, and the time between diagnosis and enrollment ranged between 31 and 61 days ( Table S1 ). 12 of 14 subjects were diagnosed with COVID-19 using PCR-based testing. The remaining two subjects were diagnosed based on serum reactivity to RBD in ELISA, clinical symptoms, and history of recent exposure ( Table S1 ).
To evaluate serum neutralizing activity, we used a pseudotyped virus with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein ( Robbiani et al., 2020 70. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmidt et al., 2020 76. Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20201181 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( STAR Methods ). We detected serum neutralization in 11 of 14 (79%) subjects ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ). ID 50 titers ranged from 51 to 655, and no correlation was seen between serum neutralization and time since diagnosis, age, or gender of the subjects ( Figures S1 B–S1D; Table S1 ).
To characterize the B cell response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike, we sorted a total of 6,113 B cells from 14 subjects that bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S or RBD ( Wrapp et al., 2020 107. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) ( Figures 1 A and 1B). The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 S- or RBD-binding B cells ranged from 0.05%–0.3% of CD19 + B cells ( Figures 1 A and 1B). We profiled sorted cells by 5′ directed scRNA-seq for both mRNA and paired VDJ profiling, recovering matched single-cell VDJ and transcriptome profiles in 129–649 cells for SARS-CoV-2 S and 47–487 cells for RBD per donor ( Figure 1 C). We identified clonally related B cells in each donor by accounting for V and J gene similarities and sequence similarity between the CDRH3 amino acid sequences ( Nouri and Kleinstein, 2018 63. Nouri, N. ∙ Kleinstein, S.H. A spectral clustering-based method for identifying clones from high-throughput B cell repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :i341-i349 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Expanded B cell clones with at least 2 clonally related cells accounted for 7%–45% of sorted B cells in the 14 subjects ( Figure 1 D).
We tested if our B cell repertoires include cells that underwent somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, two steps in the generation of high affinity mAbs ( Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012 97. Victora, G.D. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Germinal centers Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :429-457 Crossref Scopus (1116) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the fractions of immunoglobulin (Ig)G + , IgM/IgD + , and IgA + B cells varied substantially among subjects (9%–48%, 48%–87%, and 3%–12%, respectively) ( Figure S1 E). When we investigated clonal expansion within each Ig isotype, we found that in 8 of 14 subjects, IgM + clones were statistically significantly more expanded than either IgA + clones or IgG + clones or both ( Figure S1 F). Inferring levels of heavy chain somatic mutations (from RNA) ( STAR Methods ), the total number of mutations was lower in SARS-CoV-2 S- and RBD-binding B cells than in historic memory B cell (MBC) controls ( Rubelt et al., 2012 73. Rubelt, F. ∙ Sievert, V. ∙ Knaust, F. ... Onset of immune senescence defined by unbiased pyrosequencing of human immunoglobulin mRNA repertoires PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e49774 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 G) with IgM + and IgD + cells showing significantly lower levels compared to IgG + and IgA + B cells ( Figure S1 H). Lower levels of somatic mutations were especially observed in IgM + B cells with low clonal expansion because 9 of 14 subjects showed a statistically significant positive correlation between clone size and number of mutations in their IgM + repertoire ( Figure S1 I).
We next tested if our sorted B cells were enriched for Ig genes VH3-53 and VH3-66 with short CDRH3 regions, features that are preferentially found among class 1 nAbs ( Barnes et al., 2020b 3. Barnes, C.O. ∙ West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Huey-Tubman, K.E. ... Structures of Human Antibodies Bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Reveal Common Epitopes and Recurrent Features of Antibodies Cell. 2020; 182 :828-842.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2020a 108. Wu, N.C. ∙ Yuan, M. ∙ Liu, H. ... An Alternative Binding Mode of IGHV3-53 Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Cell Rep. 2020; 33 :108274 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yuan et al., 2020 113. Yuan, M. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Wu, N.C. ... Structural basis of a shared antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). 13 of the 14 recovered donors showed a higher fraction of combined VH3-53 / VH3-66 in B cell repertoires against SARS-CoV-2 S, RBD, or both compared to historic MBC controls ( Rubelt et al., 2012 73. Rubelt, F. ∙ Sievert, V. ∙ Knaust, F. ... Onset of immune senescence defined by unbiased pyrosequencing of human immunoglobulin mRNA repertoires PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e49774 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). This difference was statistically significant in 10 of 14 (71%, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.1, two-proportions Z test) subjects ( Figure 1 E) and remained significant in 10 of 14 (71%, FDR <0.1, two-proportions Z test) subjects when considering only mAbs with CDRH3 regions shorter than 14 amino acids. Among other Ab features, CDRH3 length and hydrophobicity were slightly increased and CDRH3 charge was decreased compared to historic controls, and these differences existed for both S- and RBD-binding B cells ( Figures S1 J–S1L) and across Ig isotypes ( Figures S1 M–S1O). Thus, the B cell repertoire that binds to SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV-2 RBD in recovered individuals is enriched for heavy chain genes that are associated with class 1 nAbs.
To functionally evaluate selected mAbs, we chose 4 of the 14 subjects with the highest serum neutralization titers ( Figure S1 A; Table S1 ) and produced a total of 92 mAbs from these donors ( Table S2 ). The selection of mAbs included 72 representatives from most of the expanded B cell clones in these subjects and 20 singlets ( Figures S2 A–S2D). All of the selected mAbs were expressed as IgG1s in order to allow for direct comparison of binding and neutralization and were initially evaluated for binding by ELISA. 56 of 92 mAbs (61%) showed strong or intermediate binding to either SARS-CoV-2 S, RBD, or both in ELISA ( Figure 2 A; Table S3 ). 42 of 56 strong or intermediate binders (75%) bound to both SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD, 9 of 56 (16%) only bound to SARS-CoV-2 S, and 5 of 56 (9%) only to RBD ( Figure 2 A; Table S3 ).
Polyreactivity, non-specific binding to unrelated antigens, is a feature of Abs that is selected against throughout B cell development ( Wardemann et al., 2003 101. Wardemann, H. ∙ Yurasov, S. ∙ Schaefer, A. ... Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors Science. 2003; 301 :1374-1377 Crossref Scopus (1369) PubMed Google Scholar ) but can be generated during affinity maturation ( Tiller et al., 2007 89. Tiller, T. ∙ Tsuiji, M. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Autoreactivity in human IgG+ memory B cells Immunity. 2007; 26 :205-213 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ab responses to HIV-1 envelope trimer, for example, display high levels of polyreactivity, which was suggested to be a means to increase Ab avidity ( Mouquet et al., 2010 57. Mouquet, H. ∙ Scheid, J.F. ∙ Zoller, M.J. ... Polyreactivity increases the apparent affinity of anti-HIV antibodies by heteroligation Nature. 2010; 467 :591-595 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ) and binding to divergent HIV-1 envelope strains ( Prigent et al., 2018 68. Prigent, J. ∙ Jarossay, A. ∙ Planchais, C. ... Conformational Plasticity in Broadly Neutralizing HIV-1 Antibodies Triggers Polyreactivity Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :2568-2581 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the same time, polyreactivity negatively affects half-life and clinical utility of mAbs ( Horwitz et al., 2013 31. Horwitz, J.A. ∙ Halper-Stromberg, A. ∙ Mouquet, H. ... HIV-1 suppression and durable control by combining single broadly neutralizing antibodies and antiretroviral drugs in humanized mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :16538-16543 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shingai et al., 2014 77. Shingai, M. ∙ Donau, O.K. ∙ Plishka, R.J. ... Passive transfer of modest titers of potent and broadly neutralizing anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies block SHIV infection in macaques J. Exp. Med. 2014; 211 :2061-2074 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To assess polyreactivity, we tested all 92 isolated mAbs for binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), insulin, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and streptavidin-APC by ELISA ( Wardemann et al., 2003 101. Wardemann, H. ∙ Yurasov, S. ∙ Schaefer, A. ... Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors Science. 2003; 301 :1374-1377 Crossref Scopus (1369) PubMed Google Scholar ). We included streptavidin-APC as an antigen to assess any potential off-target binding of B cells to the staining reagent used in FACS ( STAR Methods ). 11 of 92 (12%) mAbs and 6 of 56 (11%) intermediate or strong binders to SARS-CoV-2 S or RBD showed reactivity against two or more of the four polyreactivity antigens in ELISA ( Figure S2 E; Table S3 ), significantly less than polyreactivity frequencies detected in healthy MBCs (22.7%) ( Tiller et al., 2007 89. Tiller, T. ∙ Tsuiji, M. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Autoreactivity in human IgG+ memory B cells Immunity. 2007; 26 :205-213 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ) or HIV-specific B cells (75%) ( Mouquet et al., 2010 57. Mouquet, H. ∙ Scheid, J.F. ∙ Zoller, M.J. ... Polyreactivity increases the apparent affinity of anti-HIV antibodies by heteroligation Nature. 2010; 467 :591-595 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, none of our mAbs were found to be reactive in a polyreactivity ELISA assay against baculoviorus lysate ( Hötzel et al., 2012 32. Hötzel, I. ∙ Theil, F.P. ∙ Bernstein, L.J. ... A strategy for risk mitigation of antibodies with fast clearance MAbs. 2012; 4 :753-760 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S3 ; STAR Methods ). We conclude that most mAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 S-and RBD-binding B cells are not polyreactive when expressed as IgG1.
We next screened all 92 mAbs for neutralizing activity in a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay ( Robbiani et al., 2020 70. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmidt et al., 2020 76. Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20201181 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) (above and STAR Methods ). 27 of 92 mAbs (29%) showed neutralizing activity when tested up to a concentration of at least 25 μg/mL, and nAbs were identified from all 4 selected subjects ( Figure S2 F; Tables S2 and S3 ). IC 50 values ranged from 3 ng/mL to 25 μg/mL with a median of 99 ng/mL ( Figure S2 F; Table S2 ). Neutralizers showed at least intermediate binding in ELISA to both SARS-CoV-2 S trimer and RBD, with the exception of BG4-14, a weak neutralizer with binding by ELISA only to RBD ( Tables S2 and S3 ).
Neutralizing activity was detected for 21 of 42 mAbs (50%) selected from IgG + cells compared with 4 of 35 (11%) from IgM + /D + cells and 2 of 15 (13%) from IgA + cells (χ 2 = 15.9, p value 0.0004) ( Tables S2 and S3 ). When we tested the 27 neutralizers in a neutralization assay against authentic SARS-CoV-2, we found the results between both SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays to be comparable (correlation coefficient [r] for comparison between IC 50 values 0.701, p value <0.0001) ( Figure 2 B; Table S2 ). We conclude that nAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were present in all four selected subjects mostly arise from IgG + B cells and are active against both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2.
Several circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2, including B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 ( Davies et al., 2021 16. Davies, N.G. ∙ Abbott, S. ∙ Barnard, R.C. ...

Liu, Y. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Xia, H. ... Neutralizing Activity of BNT162b2-Elicited Serum - Preliminary Report N. Engl. J.

Med. 2021; Published online February 17, 2021 Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar ). We produced pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses carrying the reported spike mutations in found these variants ( STAR Methods ) and tested our most potent mAbs (BG10-19, BG1-22, BG4-25, and BG7-15) in pseudovirus neutralization assays ( Figures 2 C and S2 H). All four mAbs neutralized B.1.1.7 with similar potency as wild-type (WT) (D614G) and both BG10-19 and BG7-15 retained neutralization potency against B.1.351, whereas both BG1-22 and BG4-25 showed a 15-fold increase in IC 50 values against this variant ( Figures 2 C and S2 G). We conclude that BG10-19 and BG7-15 retain potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, likely by recognizing an epitope outside of variant RBD mutations.
mAbs that target conserved epitopes among different betacoronaviruses are subject of intense investigation given their potential utility in future coronavirus outbreaks. A small set of mAbs that were isolated from SARS-CoV-infected individuals have been shown to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 ( Pinto et al., 2020 66. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ) and vice versa ( Robbiani et al., 2020 70. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To evaluate potential cross-reactivity of our mAbs to other coronaviruses, we tested all 92 mAbs for binding to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and RBD in ELISA ( Figure 2 D; Table S3 ). Two SARS-CoV-2 non-neutralizing mAbs showed strong cross binding to MERS (BG4-23 and BG1-13), one of which (BG4-23) also showed strong cross binding to SARS-CoV ( Table S3 ). Three SARS-CoV-2 neutralizers (BG1-28, BG10-14, and BG10-19) showed strong cross-binding to SARS-CoV ( Table S3 ). Of these, only BG10-19 neutralized SARS-CoV potently in a pseudovirus neutralization assay with an IC 50 value of 3 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL for S309, a cross neutralizing mAb isolated from a SARS-CoV patient ( Figure 2 E) ( Pinto et al., 2020 66. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). BG10-19 also neutralized SARS-CoV-2 more potently than S309 with an IC 50 of 9 ng/mL compared to 79 ng/mL ( Table S2 ) ( Pinto et al., 2020 66. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). BG1-28 and BG10-14 did not neutralize SARS-CoV and neither did a selection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizers that showed intermediate cross binding to SARS-CoV in ELISA ( Figure 2 E; Table S3 ).
Secreted IgA and IgM can, if expressed with a J chain, multimerize and therefore increase overall avidity depending on the density and accessibility of the antigen binding sites ( Klein and Bjorkman, 2010 39. Klein, J.S. ∙ Bjorkman, P.J. Few and far between: how HIV may be evading antibody avidity PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6 :e1000908 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this, some IgA dimers of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs show increased neutralizing potency ( Wang et al., 2020 99. Wang, Z. ∙ Lorenzi, J.C.C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization by Secretory IgA in vitro bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
To test the effect of dimerization on neutralizing activity in our mAbs, we expressed 13 of the 15 mAbs that were derived from IgA + B cells ( Tables S2 and S3 ) as IgA monomers and dimers ( Figures S2 H and S2I) and tested them in a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Both mAbs that showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 as IgG1 (BG1-23 and BG1-26) showed similar neutralization potency when expressed as IgA monomers. In dimeric form, BG1-23 and BG1-26 neutralizing activity increased with molar neutralization ratios (MNRs) ( Klein and Bjorkman, 2010 39. Klein, J.S. ∙ Bjorkman, P.J. Few and far between: how HIV may be evading antibody avidity PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6 :e1000908 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ) of 6 and 8, respectively, suggesting an added avidity effect ( Figures S2 J and S2K). 6 of the mAbs that had not shown any neutralizing activity as IgG1 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 either only as dimeric IgA (BG10-5) or both as IgA monomer and dimer ( Figures S2 J and S2K). MNRs >2 were observed for weakly neutralizing IgA dimer BG1-27 (MNR = 3) and potently neutralizing IgA dimer BG10-8 (MNR = 10.86), suggesting that in these cases dimerization leads to increased overall avidity of the Ab ( Figures S2 J and S2K). We conclude that the neutralizing activity of some SARS-CoV-2 mAbs can be increased through expression as monomeric or dimeric IgA.
To understand the mechanism of BG10-19-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we determined a 3.3Å single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a complex between SARS-CoV-2 S trimer ( Hsieh et al., 2020 33. Hsieh, C.L. ∙ Goldsmith, J.A. ∙ Schaub, J.M. ... Structure-based design of prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes Science. 2020; 369 :1501-1505 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the BG10-19 Fab ( Figures 3 and S3 ; Table S5 ).
The BG10-19 S structure revealed S trimers adopting a closed conformation bound to three BG10-19 Fabs ( Figures 3 A and S3 A–S3D). BG10-19 recognizes a quaternary epitope comprising interactions that bridge two neighboring RBDs and the N165 NTD -glycan on the adjacent NTD ( Figure 3 B). Specifically, BG10-19 uses five of its six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops to interact with a proteoglycan epitope focused atop the RBD α1 (residues 338–347) and α2 (residues 364–374) helices, with additional contacts with residues 436–450 ( Figures 3 C–3E). The N343 RBD -glycan (modeled as a complex-type pentasaccharide) interfaces with both CDRH3 and CDRL2 loops, including contacts with the core fucose moiety in a manner similar to the cross-reactive mAb S309 ( Figure 3 E) ( Pinto et al., 2020 66. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CDRH2 and CDRH3 loops mediate the majority of RBD contacts (~760 Å 2 of ~1,090 Å 2 total paratope buried surface area [BSA]), establishing extensive polar and van der Waals interactions with RBD residues ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Collectively, interactions mediated by CDRH1-3 and CDRL2 loops establish the primary epitope recognized by BG10-19, which does not overlap with the ACE2 receptor-binding motif (RBM) ( Figure S3 E) and accounts for 87% of epitope BSA on the S trimer (~925 Å 2 of peptide BSA and ~220 Å 2 glycan BSA).
However, unlike the binding mode of S309, BG10-19 adopts a pose that positions the light chain CDRL1 loop and FWR3 atop a neighboring “down” RBD, which contributes an additional ~150 Å 2 BSA to the total quaternary epitope ( Figures 3 A–3D). This binding orientation is distinct from previously described nAbs that utilize interactions of long CDRH3s to mediate bridging interactions to stabilize the S trimer in a closed state ( Barnes et al., 2020a 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tortorici et al, 2020 92. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Beltramello, M. ∙ Lempp, F.A. ... Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms Science. 2020; 370 :950-957 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, BG10-19 interactions with the neighboring RBD also prevent sampling of the “up” RBD conformation ( Figure S3 C). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 S trimer binding to immobilized sACE2-CH3 ( Tada et al., 2020 82. Tada, T. ∙ Fan, C. ∙ Chen, J.S. ... An ACE2 Microbody Containing a Single Immunoglobulin Fc Domain Is a Potent Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Cell Rep. 2020; 33 :108528 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) was blocked in the presence of BG10-19 Fab, while a RBD-BG10-19 complex was capable of binding sACE2 in SPR experiments ( Figure 3 H). These data suggest that BG10-19 utilizes a neutralization mechanism that inhibits exposure of the ACE2 RBM, by locking the S trimer into a closed conformation.
Sequence conservation at the BG10-19 epitope explains the potent cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV ( Figure 2 E), in that 23 of 29 residues are strictly or conservatively substituted between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs ( Figure S3 F). Given the conserved nature of the BG10-19 epitope, we characterized the potential of BG10-19 to cross-react with zoonotic sarbecoviruses. Bat coronavirus strains WIV1-CoV and SCH014-CoV are clade 1 sarbecoviruses and ACE2-tropic ( Li et al., 2003 47. Li, W. ∙ Moore, M.J. ∙ Vasilieva, N. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus Nature. 2003; 426 :450-454 Crossref Scopus (2987) PubMed Google Scholar ). When we assessed BG10-19 cross-reactivity to these viruses, we observed binding to WIV1-CoV RBD at the same levels as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but no neutralizing activity ( Figures S3 G–S3J). The lack of neutralizing activity against WIV1-CoV was surprising, given its 95% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV ( Cohen et al., 2021 11. Cohen, A.A. ∙ Gnanapragasam, P.N.P. ∙ Lee, Y.E. ... Mosaic nanoparticles elicit cross-reactive immune responses to zoonotic coronaviruses in mice Science. 2021; 371 :735-741 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pinto et al., 2020 66. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, our findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 trimer-specific Ab response includes rare mAbs such as BG10-19 with highly potent cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV.
As mentioned above, our scRNA-seq approach pairs VDJ sequences and expression profiles of B cell populations sorted from 14 convalescent subjects, and can therefore provide insights into the expression states of SARS-CoV2-specific B cells. These B cells were selected based on expression of CD20, CD19, and SARS-CoV-2 S or RBD binding alone without selection for other surface markers ( STAR Methods and above). We profiled 6,113 sorted B cells, revealing 6 distinct transcriptional cell clusters (TCs) ( Figures 4 A and 4B) that had representation from all donors, although with enrichment of some donors in specific clusters ( Figure S4 A and see below). These clusters were neither dependent on binding to SARS-CoV-2 S or RBD ( Figure S4 B) nor on cell-cycle phase ( Figure S4 C). CD44 and CXCR4 were expressed in cells from all TCs, consistent with their frequent expression among mature B cells ( Figure S4 D) ( Kremmidiotis and Zola, 1995 40. Kremmidiotis, G. ∙ Zola, H.

The role of CXCR4 in maintaining peripheral B cell compartments and humoral immunity J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200 :1145-1156 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD38 expression levels were low throughout all clusters, in keeping with our selection of B cells expressing surface Ig binding to SARS-CoV-2 S or RBD ( Ellebedy et al., 2016 21. Ellebedy, A.H. ∙ Jackson, K.J. ∙ Kissick, H.T. ... Defining antigen-specific plasmablast and memory B cell subsets in human blood after viral infection or vaccination Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1226-1234 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 D). The cell clusters were distinguished by increased expression of specific marker genes ( Figure 4 A), such as genes associated with different B cell populations, including naive and MBCs, consistent with isotype, mutation status, and clonal expansion features of these cells. Specifically, the TC1 marker genes FCER2 (CD23) and TCL1A are known to be highly expressed in mature naive B cells ( Figure 4 A; Table S4 ) ( Horns et al., 2020 30. Horns, F. ∙ Dekker, C.L. ∙ Quake, S.R. Memory B Cell Activation, Broad Anti-influenza Antibodies, and Bystander Activation Revealed by Single-Cell Transcriptomics Cell Rep. 2020; 30 :905-913.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with an enrichment in TC1 of IgD + and IgM + B cells (36% and 63% of cells, respectively) ( Figure S4 E) with low levels of inferred somatic mutations ( Figure S4 F) and minimal clonal expansion ( Figures S4 G and S4H).

Cells in TC3 and TC4 also highly expressed CXCR3, a chemokine receptor found on some class switched B cells that is believed to facilitate migration to sites of inflammation ( Moroney et al., 2020 56. Moroney, J.B. ∙ Vasudev, A. ∙ Pertsemlidis, A. ... Integrative transcriptome and chromatin landscape analysis reveals distinct epigenetic regulations in human memory B cells Nat.

In the weeks following vaccination or infection with influenza or infection with Ebola, antigen-specific B cells can present as Ab secreting cells, MBCs or “activated B cells” (ABCs), which wane after several weeks and show relatively higher expression levels of CD52, TLR10, CD19, and CD20 ( Ellebedy et al., 2016 21. Ellebedy, A.H. ∙ Jackson, K.J. ∙ Kissick, H.T. ... Defining antigen-specific plasmablast and memory B cell subsets in human blood after viral infection or vaccination Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1226-1234 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test if either TC3 or TC4 include ABCs, we examined the distribution of expression levels in each cell cluster of CD52, TLR10, CD19, and CD20 and 10 other genes that are expressed at higher levels in ABCs compared to MBCs ( Figure S5 A) ( Ellebedy et al., 2016 21. Ellebedy, A.H. ∙ Jackson, K.J. ∙ Kissick, H.T. ... Defining antigen-specific plasmablast and memory B cell subsets in human blood after viral infection or vaccination Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1226-1234 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). All 14 genes were significantly higher expressed (one-tailed t test, FDR <0.01) in TC4 than in TC3 ( Figure S5 A). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 S- and RBD-binding B cell repertoires in recently recovered subjects include ABCs (TC4) and MBCs (TC3) that are both mostly IgG1 + and show expansion of B cell clones and somatic hypermutation. We also detected IgD + and IgM + mature naive B cells (TC1) with low levels of somatic hypermutation, minimal clonal expansion, and high expression of CD23 and TCLA1.
To relate mAbs with high levels of binding to or neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 to B cells in certain TCs, we identified the clusters from which the 92 mAbs we produced and tested were derived. Because we selected mAbs for testing based on representation of expanded clones (72/92) or randomly selected singlets that were mostly IgG + or IgA + (20/92), all TCs are not equally represented among the 92 mAbs ( Table S3 ). Nevertheless, 20 of 33 (60%) neutralizers, 14 of 15 (94%) potent neutralizers (monomeric IC 50 ≤0.1 μg/mL), and 5 of 10 (50%) non-neutralizing high binders were derived from cells in TC3 and TC4, whereas 36 of 49 (73%) of the non-neutralizing low binders belonged to TC0 and TC2 ( Figures 4 D and S2 J; Tables S2 and S3 ). The majority of neutralizers from TC3 and TC4 were derived from singlets or small clones and did not have clonal members in other TCs among the cells we sampled ( Figure S5 B; Table S3 ; Data S1 ). We further tested our clusters for enrichment in class 1 nAbs ( VH3-53/VH3-66 antibodies with short CDRH3 regions [ Barnes et al., 2020a 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ] and see above). VH3-53/VH3-66 Abs were overall significantly enriched in TC3 and TC4 compared to TC1, TC2, and TC5 (two-tailed t test, p ≤ 0.0001) ( Figures 4 E and S5 C), and 8 of 8 evaluated VH3-53 / VH3-66 nAbs with short CDRH3 regions were derived from B cells that belonged to either TC3 or TC4 ( Tables S2 and S3 ). We conclude that the cells from which we isolated strongly binding and neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 frequently had transcriptional profiles consistent with MBCs and ABCs.
While MBCs and antibody-secreting plasma cells are two separate B cell compartments ( Leyendeckers et al., 1999 46. Leyendeckers, H. ∙ Odendahl, M. ∙ Löhndorf, A. ... Correlation analysis between frequencies of circulating antigen-specific IgG-bearing memory B cells and serum titers of antigen-specific IgG Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29 :1406-1417 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), they can originate from the same germinal center reaction, ( Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012 97. Victora, G.D. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Germinal centers Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :429-457 Crossref Scopus (1116) PubMed Google Scholar ) and antibodies against HIV-1 envelope derived from MBCs have been detected in serum from matched patients ( Scheid et al., 2009 74. Scheid, J.F. ∙ Mouquet, H. ∙ Feldhahn, N. ... Broad diversity of neutralizing antibodies isolated from memory B cells in HIV-infected individuals Nature. 2009; 458 :636-640 Crossref Scopus (661) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether the frequency of MBCs among SARS-CoV-2 S- and RBD-binding B cells correlates with plasma neutralizing activity in recently recovered subjects is not known. To test this, we measured if the frequency of cells from any TC correlated with serum neutralization in the 14 study subjects and found that the frequency of only TC3 and TC4 cells correlated positively with serum neutralization (Pearson’s r = 0.64 and 0.66, p = 0.013 and 0.011, respectively) ( Figure S5 D), and this correlation was not significantly affected by correcting for time since COVID-19 diagnosis (Pearson’s r = 0.69 and 0.76, p = 0.017 and 0.007, respectively). We conclude that expansion of both SARS-CoV-2 binding MBCs and ABCs correlate with serum neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent COVID-19 patients.
Given the enrichment of VH3-53/VH3- 66-encoded Abs in TC3 and TC4, we selected two mAbs that were coded by cells in these clusters with distinct CDRH3 lengths for structural characterization. We solved a 3.0 Å crystal structure of Fabs from BG4-25 ( VH3- 53-encoded with 12 aa CDRH3) and the SARS-CoV mAb CR3022 ( Tian et al., 2020 88. Tian, X. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Huang, A. ... Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2020; 9 :382-385 Crossref Scopus (595) PubMed Google Scholar ) in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure S6 A; Table S6 ). Consistent with the binding mode of class 1 nAbs ( Barnes et al., 2020b 3. Barnes, C.O. ∙ West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Huey-Tubman, K.E. ...

Structural basis of a shared antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), BG4-25 recognizes an RBD epitope that overlaps with >90% of residues in the ACE2 RBM ( Figure S6 B), which is only fully accessible with “up” RBD conformations. Two V-gene encoded regions in class 1 nAbs prominently contribute to epitope recognition—the 31 SNY 33 CDRH1 and 53 SGGS 56 CDRH2 sequence motifs, which take part in extensive hydrogen bond interactions at the RBD interface ( Tan et al., 2021 84.

Yuan, M. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Wu, N.C. ... Structural basis of a shared antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of inferred somatic mutations in 93 VH3-53/VH3-66 mAbs coded in our collection of SARS-CoV-2 binding B cells with CDRH3 less than 14 amino acids (IMGT definition) ( Lefranc et al., 2015 45. Lefranc, M.P. ∙ Giudicelli, V. ∙ Duroux, P. ... IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® 25 years on Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D413-D422 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed frequent inferred mutations in these motifs, including S31R and S56T in the Ab heavy chain, which are observed in BG4-25 ( Figures S6 C–S6E). VH3-53/VH3-66 -encoded Abs from SARS-CoV-2 binding B cells with short CDRH3s were also enriched for inferred mutations Y58F, F27L, and T28I, which have been shown to increase neutralization potency and affinity class 1 Abs ( Hurlburt et al., 2020 34. Hurlburt, N.K. ∙ Seydoux, E. ∙ Wan, Y.H. ... Structural basis for potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and role of antibody affinity maturation Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5413 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite lacking these specific mutations, BG4-25 shows exceptional neutralizing activity, which is potentially explained by the F27I and S31R CDRH1 loop mutations that provide increased van der Waals interactions along the mAb-RBD interface ( Figure S6 D and S6E).
In addition to the recurrent class 1 nAbs defined by VH3-53/VH3-66 -encoded gene segments and short CDRH3s (e.g., BG4-25), a subset of VH3-53/VH3-66 -encoded nAbs have been described with CDRH3 lengths >15 amino acids that would seemingly be incompatible with the binding mode of class 1 nAbs. A 3.7 Å cryo-EM structure of BG1-22 ( VH3- 53-encoded with 21 aa CDRH3) ( Table S2 ) Fab complexed with stabilized S trimers revealed binding to “up” RBD conformations ( Figures 5 A and S6 F–S6H). Local refinement to improve the cryo-EM density at the interface ( Figure S6 H) revealed a binding orientation of BG1-22 that was consistent with class 1 nAb binding modes ( Figure 5 B), which contrasts with previously characterized VH3-53/VH3-66 -long CDRH3 antibodies ( Barnes et al., 2020a 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2020a 108.

An Alternative Binding Mode of IGHV3-53 Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Cell Rep. 2020; 33 :108274 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). To accommodate this binding mode, the 21-residue long CDRH3 of BG1-22 flips outward toward RBD residue Q493 resulting in a slight rotation of the Ab light chain relative to the canonical class 1 RBD-binding nAbs ( Figures 5 C–5E). The displaced CDRH3 conformation makes few sidechain interactions with the RBD, such that 6 residues of the CDRH3 loop are disordered ( Figures 5 C and 5D).
Although unliganded Fab structures often exhibit a disordered CDRH3 (e.g., 1RZI and 1RZF), it is unusual for an Ab bound to an antigen to exhibit a disordered CDRH3. From an examination of 731 Ab-antigen structures with resolutions of 3.5 Å or better in the Structural Antibody Database (SABDab) ( Dunbar et al., 2014 19. Dunbar, J. ∙ Krawczyk, K. ∙ Leem, J. ... SAbDab: the structural antibody database Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :D1140-D1146 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found only 6 with missing residue numbers between heavy chain residues 95 to 107, implying a disordered CDRH3 (PDBs 3LH2 , 4JDT , 7JWB , 5ANM , 4M8Q , and 3LHP ). None of these complexes involved conventional Ab-antigen pairs; instead, they were germline forms of Abs, the epitope was presented in a scaffold, or only the VH domain was involved in binding. This suggests that the orientation adopted by BG1-22 is not one that promotes CDRH3-mediated interactions with the antigen, as is classically observed in Ab-antigen structures, but instead simply accommodates the longer CDRH3 length by displacing much of the loop to outside the Ab-antigen interface. Taken together, these results provide further insight into class 1 nAbs and suggest that longer CDRH3s, although infrequent, are not a restriction to V-gene mediated interactions at the RBD interface of this Ab class.
To further understand the specificity of RBD-targeting, we determined cryo-EM structures of Fab-S complexes for three additional nAbs: BG7-15 ( VH1-18 -encoded, 11 aa CDRH3, IC 80 = 92 ng/mL), BG7-20 ( VH1-8 -encoded, 20 aa CDRH3, IC 80 = 23 ng/mL), and BG1-24 ( VH1-69 -encoded, 16 aa CDRH3, IC 80 = 7 ng/mL), to resolutions of 3.7, 4.0, and 3.9 Å, respectively ( Figures 6 and S7 ; Table S5 ). In all cases, Fabs were bound to either up or down RBD conformations, demonstrating recognition of Ab epitopes in either state. Analysis of the BG7-15-S structure revealed an Ab epitope focused on RBD residues 439–451, mainly mediated by contacts with CDRH3 and CDRL3 loops ( Figure 6 B–6D). Overlay of BG7-15 and REGN-10987 ( Hansen et al., 2020 28. Hansen, J. ∙ Baum, A. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Studies in humanized mice and convalescent humans yield a SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail Science. 2020; 369 :1010-1014 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed a shared Ab footprint that binds outside the ACE2 RBM but would sterically hinder ACE2 receptor binding to RBD ( Figures 3 H and 6 E) while allowing binding of class 1 nAbs (e.g., BG4-25, C102, and REGN-10933).
Cryo-EM structures of BG7-20 and BG1-24 S complexes revealed RBD-targeting similar to nAbs that belong to the class 2 binding mode ( Barnes et al., 2020a 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). This class of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs recognizes up and down RBD conformations, overlaps with the ACE2 RBM, has secondary interactions with neighboring “up” RBDs, and has the potential for intra-protomer avidity effects. Consistent with class 2 nAbs, BG7-20 and BG1-24 show a similar epitope focused along the RBD ridge that overlaps with residues involved in ACE2 binding and includes contacts with E484, F486, and Q493. The binding pose of BG1-24 promotes stabilization of the N165 NTD glycan, adding to the observation that class 2 nAbs can involve interprotomer glycan contacts ( Cao et al., 2020 6. Cao, Y. ∙ Su, B. ∙ Guo, X. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 identified by high-throughput single-cell sequencing of convalescent patients’ B cells Cell. 2020; 182 :73-84.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the N-glycan interaction is mediated by a hydrophobic Met-Phe sequence at the tip of CDRH2, a common feature of VH1-69 Abs ( Chen et al., 2019 10. Chen, F. ∙ Tzarum, N. ∙ Wilson, I.A. ... V H 1-69 antiviral broadly neutralizing antibodies: genetics, structures, and relevance to rational vaccine design Curr. Opin. Virol. 2019; 34 :149-159 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). This feature has been attributed to facilitating broad neutralization by Abs against influenza and hepatitis C ( Guthmiller et al., 2020 27. Guthmiller, J.J. ∙ Lan, L.Y. ∙ Fernández-Quintero, M.L. ... Polyreactive Broadly Neutralizing B cells Are Selected to Provide Defense against Pandemic Threat Influenza Viruses Immunity. 2020; 53 :1230-1244.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2019 10. Chen, F. ∙ Tzarum, N. ∙ Wilson, I.A. ... V H 1-69 antiviral broadly neutralizing antibodies: genetics, structures, and relevance to rational vaccine design Curr. Opin. Virol. 2019; 34 :149-159 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) and likely explains BG1-24’s polyreactivity ( Figure S2 E; Table S3 ).
With the use of mAbs as therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 infection, understanding possible RBD mutations selected under mAb pressure and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 isolates harboring RBD mutations that confer immune escape is critical. Although deep mutational scanning and in vitro selection experiments have facilitated the choice of therapeutic mAb cocktails, these experiments have also illustrated that in some cases single-point mutations are sufficient for viral escape ( Greaney et al., 2021 24. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Starr, T.N. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ... Complete Mapping of Mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain that Escape Antibody Recognition Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 29 :44-57 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weisblum et al., 2020 102. Weisblum, Y. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Zhang, F. ... Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants eLife. 2020; 9 :e61312 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 spike variant N439K could limit the use of REGN-10987 as a therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection by conferring escape ( Barnes et al., 2020b 3. Barnes, C.O. ∙ West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Huey-Tubman, K.E. ... Structures of Human Antibodies Bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Reveal Common Epitopes and Recurrent Features of Antibodies Cell. 2020; 182 :828-842.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the variant B.1.351 is resistant to its partner antibody REGN-10933 ( Tada et al., 2021 83. Tada, T. ∙ Dcosta, B.M. ∙ Zhou, H. ... Decreased neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 global variants by therapeutic anti-spike protein monoclonal antibodies bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Google Scholar ).
To assess the effects of RBD substitutions, we assayed ELISA binding and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization for 6 mAbs reported in this study against a panel of RBD substitutions ( Figures 7 A–7H). Decreased binding and neutralization potency was observed for most mAbs when RBD substitutions occurred within the Ab epitope and were consistent with RBD mutations known to decrease binding of mAbs in the same class ( Figures 7 B–7H) ( Barnes et al., 2020a 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Greaney et al., 2021 24. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Starr, T.N. ∙ Gilchuk, P. ... Complete Mapping of Mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain that Escape Antibody Recognition Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 29 :44-57 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notable exceptions included BG7-15, which showed neutralizing activity against the RBD N439K mutant that confers escape against REGN-10987, and BG4-25, which neutralized the class 1 escape variant A475V ( Figures 7 E and 7F). In general, decreased binding affinity correlated with RBD mutations that conferred viral escape in pseudotyped viral neutralization assays and were consistent with the observation that RBD mutations that affect antibodies from one class do not affect mAbs in a different RBD-targeting class ( Figures 7 C–7H). Given that several nAbs were non-competitive, we assessed nAb cocktails for synergistic neutralization effects (IC 50eff >1) against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus using a previously described synergistic model ( West et al., 2010 103. West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Galimidi, R.P. ∙ Foglesong, C.P. ... Evaluation of CD4-CD4i antibody architectures yields potent, broadly cross-reactive anti-human immunodeficiency virus reagents J. Virol. 2010; 84 :261-269 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Results suggest that only the BG10-19 + BG4-25 nAb combination demonstrated synergistic neutralizing activity ( Figure 7 I), consistent with published results for similarly classed nAb pairs ( Hansen et al., 2020 28. Hansen, J. ∙ Baum, A. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Studies in humanized mice and convalescent humans yield a SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail Science. 2020; 369 :1010-1014 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, given the broad binding and neutralization activity of BG10-19 against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 RBD substitutions ( Figures 7 A and 7C), we utilized a rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus to determine spike variants that escape neutralization by BG10-19 ( Weisblum et al., 2020 102. Weisblum, Y. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Zhang, F. ... Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants eLife. 2020; 9 :e61312 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( STAR Methods ). Initial attempts at selection experiments for BG10-19 showed no viral escape variants, consistent with observations for potently neutralizing convalescent plasma and some mAbs ( Weisblum et al., 2020 102. Weisblum, Y. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Zhang, F. ... Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants eLife. 2020; 9 :e61312 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, after several passages, plaque-purified viruses harboring the G339R and L441P mutations showed partial escape from BG10-19 ( Figure 7 J). We note that neither of these two mutations have so far been sequenced and deposited on the GISAID database ( Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017 20. Elbe, S. ∙ Buckland-Merrett, G. Data, disease and diplomacy: GISAID’s innovative contribution to global health Glob. Chall. 2017; 1 :33-46 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we conclude that BG10-19’s SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV cross neutralization and ability to tolerate single RBD mutations within its epitope makes it an attractive therapeutic candidate.

Section: Discussion

Abs play an indispensable role in antiviral responses both through their ability to neutralize ( Corti and Lanzavecchia, 2013 12. Corti, D. ∙ Lanzavecchia, A. Broadly neutralizing antiviral antibodies Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31 :705-742 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by engaging other components of the immune system through interactions with their Fc regions ( Bournazos et al., 2020 4. Bournazos, S. ∙ Gupta, A. ∙ Ravetch, J.V. The role of IgG Fc receptors in antibody-dependent enhancement Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :633-643 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Different viruses perturb Ab responses through characteristic mechanisms. HIV-1, for example, constrains efficient Ab responses through narrow structural pathways to broad neutralization ( Scheid et al., 2011 75. Scheid, J.F. ∙ Mouquet, H. ∙ Ueberheide, B. ... Sequence and structural convergence of broad and potent HIV antibodies that mimic CD4 binding Science. 2011; 333 :1633-1637 Crossref Scopus (791) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by causing B cell exhaustion ( Moir et al., 2008 54. Moir, S. ∙ Ho, J. ∙ Malaspina, A. ... Evidence for HIV-associated B cell exhaustion in a dysfunctional memory B cell compartment in HIV-infected viremic individuals J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205 :1797-1805 Crossref Scopus (577) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this study, we show from a comprehensive in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 binding B cells from convalescent individuals that the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 binding B cells includes MBCs and ABCs, as well as mature naive B cells. Interestingly, we found clonal cells to be present in TC0, which is enriched in IgM + B cells with inferred somatic mutations and low expression of CD27. Despite showing clonal expansion and somatic mutations, mAbs produced from this cluster were mostly low binding and non-neutralizing. We speculate that this cluster might contain cells from an early extrafollicular B cell response, as was observed in influenza infection ( Lam and Baumgarth, 2019 44. Lam, J.H. ∙ Baumgarth, N. The Multifaceted B Cell Response to Influenza Virus J. Immunol. 2019; 202 :351-359 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, high binding and potent neutralizing activity were mostly detected in mAbs isolated from ABCs and MBCs that shared transcriptional phenotypes across different individuals.
Immunologic correlates for protection from SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination or prior exposure are not yet defined, but studies of other respiratory viruses suggest that serum neutralization could play an important role in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 ( Kulkarni et al., 2018 42. Kulkarni, P.S. ∙ Hurwitz, J.L. ∙ Simões, E.A.F. ... Establishing Correlates of Protection for Vaccine Development: Considerations for the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine Field Viral Immunol. 2018; 31 :195-203 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Verschoor et al., 2015 96. Verschoor, C.P. ∙ Singh, P. ∙ Russell, M.L. ... Microneutralization assay titres correlate with protection against seasonal influenza H1N1 and H3N2 in children PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0131531 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with other SARS-CoV-2 studies, we did not detect any intra-donor correlation between serum neutralization and the potency of mAbs ( Robbiani et al., 2020 70. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ), but we found a strong correlation between serum neutralization and the relative size of the ABC and MBC populations. This underscores the close relationship between high-affinity MBC responses and serum Ab activity in SARS-CoV-2. It will be important to investigate if a similar correlation exists in individuals who have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 in an effort to delineate different responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Our structural analysis revealed new insights into commonalities and differences among RBD-specific mAbs. For example, in common with potently neutralizing mAbs C144 ( Barnes et al., 2020a 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ) and S2M11 ( Tortorici,et al 2020 92. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Beltramello, M. ∙ Lempp, F.A. ... Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms Science. 2020; 370 :950-957 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ), BG10-19 bridges between adjacent RBDs to lock the S trimer into a closed conformation. However, in contrast to most previously described antibodies, BG10-19 recognizes a conserved epitope within the RBD core that is accessible in up/down RBD conformations on the spike trimer of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (unlike the conserved, cryptic CR3022 epitope only accessible on up RBD conformations), which may allow design of immunogens that elicit cross-reactive protection against future emerging coronaviruses. BG10-19’s unique binding/neutralization properties and its resistance to all single RBD mutations identified in circulating isolates with a frequency >0.1% based on the GISAID database ( Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017 20. Elbe, S. ∙ Buckland-Merrett, G. Data, disease and diplomacy: GISAID’s innovative contribution to global health Glob. Chall. 2017; 1 :33-46 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), including those found within the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages, make this a compelling therapeutic candidate in the arsenal against SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, high-resolution structures of VH3-53/VH3-66 -class mAbs provided further understanding of the rules that govern potent neutralization and viral escape from this recurring antibody class and showed that CDRH3 length may not be a limitation to VH gene segment-mediated interactions at the RBD interface. Collectively, these structures and insights into the cellular processes behind the induction of potent, cross-reactive nAbs will not only aid us in our battle to control the current COVID-19 pandemic through the use of safe and effective mAb treatments but will also provide additional criteria for the evaluation of humoral immune responses elicited from candidate vaccines against emerging zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential.
Limitations of this study include that mAbs were selected for validation only based on membership in large, expanded clones (72 antibodies) and 20 singlets. Therefore, not all TCs were equally evaluated functionally. In addition, mAbs isolated from IgM + B cells were only evaluated as IgG1 expressed monomers. The comparatively low affinity of these antibodies could potentially be improved in vivo if expressed as pentamers, similar to our observation of increased neutralization of some IgA mAbs when expressed as dimers.

The coordinates generated from X-ray crystallographic studies of the BG4-25 – CR3022 – RBD complex have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (https:// www.rcsb.org ) under accession code PDB: 7M6D. The atomic models and cryo-EM maps generated from cryo-EM studies of the BG10-19 – S 6P, BG7-15 – S 6P, BG1-22 – S 6P, BG7-20 – S 6P, and BG1-24 – S 6P complexes have been deposited at the PDB and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/ ) under the following accession numbers: PDB: 7M6E, 7M6F, 7M6G, 7M6H, and 7M6I; EMD: EMD-23694, EMD-23695, EMD-23696, EMD-23697, and EMD-23698, respectively.
All work with human samples was performed in accordance with approved Institutional Review Board protocols (IRB) which were reviewed by the IRB at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston. Subjects who had recovered from COVID-19 ( Table S1 ) were recruited through a patient cohort that has been created in collaboration between The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge (MA, USA) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston (MA, USA) under IRB protocol 2020P000849, “Biorepository for Samples from those at increased risk for or infected with SARS-CoV-2.” Blood draws were performed at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Serum ELISAs against SARS-CoV-2 RBD were performed in a protocol modified from Roy et al. (2020) 72. Roy, V. ∙ Fischinger, S. ∙ Atyeo, C. ... SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA development J. Immunol. Methods. 2020; 484-485 :112832 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar . MaxiSorp 384-well microplates (Sigma) were coated with 50 μl/well of 2,500 ng/ml of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in coating buffer (1 packet BupH carbonate-bicarbonate (ThermoFisher) in 500 mL of Milli-Q H20) overnight at 4°C. Plates were then washed 3 times with 100 μl/well of wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20, 400 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0] in Milli-Q H20) using a BioTek 406 plate washer. Plates were blocked by adding 100 μl/well of blocking buffer (1% BSA, 140 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were then washed as described above. 50 μL of 1:100 diluted serum samples in dilution buffer (1% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, 140 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) were added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Plates were then washed 7 times as described above. 50 μl/well of 1:25,000 diluted detection Ab solution (HRP-anti human IgG and IgM, Bethyl Laboratory #A80-104P, A80-100P) was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were then washed 7 times as described above. 40 μl/well of Pierce TMB peroxidase substrate (ThermoFisher) was then added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 3 min (IgG) or 5 min (IgM). The reaction was then stopped by adding 40 μl/well of stop solution (0.5M H2S04 in Milli-Q H20) to each well. The OD was read after 15 min at 450 nm and 570 nm on a BioTek Synergy HT using Gen5 software. For control mABs CR3022 ( Tian et al., 2020 88. Tian, X. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Huang, A. ... Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2020; 9 :382-385 Crossref Scopus (595) PubMed Google Scholar ) IgG1 and IgM (Absolute Antibody #Ab01680-10.0, Ab01680-15.0) dilution curves, the mAbs were diluted to a concentration of 1 μg/ml in dilution buffer and duplicate 12 two-fold serial dilution curves were generated. One known positive and two known negative samples were included on each plate as controls.
A standard curve based on absorbances from the mAb CR3022 ( Tian et al., 2020 88. Tian, X. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Huang, A. ... Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2020; 9 :382-385 Crossref Scopus (595) PubMed Google Scholar ) dilution series included with each plate was used to estimate Ab abundance in test samples and allow for comparison of results across batches. Estimated Ab abundance in test samples was compared to the background signal from a cohort of pre-pandemic serum samples that served as negative controls. Serum samples with Ab abundance greater than 3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean of the pre-pandemic serum samples were considered to be positive and samples with Ab abundance less than 3 SD above the mean of the pre-pandemic serum samples were considered negative.
Neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was measured using a single-round infection assay in human ACE2-expressing target cells. Convalescent patient serum samples were tested against pseudotyped virus particles produced in 293T/17 cells (American Type Culture Collection) by co-transfection of plasmids encoding codon-optimized S (containing D at position 614) with a partially deleted cytoplasmic tail (provided by Dr. Dan Barouch, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center), and the HIV-1 backbone vector SG3 Δ Env (NIH AIDS Reagent Program). This pseudovirus strain was used for infecting TZM.bl/ACE2 target cells which encode an integrated luciferase reporter gene under control of an HIV-1 LTR. Subsequently, a second pseudovirus assay platform was implemented and used for testing neutralizing activity of purified mAbs. This assay platform utilized pseudovirus produced in 293T/17 cells by co-transfection of plasmids encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length S (containing G at position 614), packaging plasmid pCMV ΔR8.2 expressing HIV-1 gag and pol, and luciferase reporter plasmid pHR’ CMV-Luc. Plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Barney Graham (NIH, Vaccine Research Center). This pseudovirus strain was used for infecting 293/ACE2 target cells. The 293T and TZM.bl cell lines stably overexpressing the human ACE2 cell surface receptor protein were kindly provided by Drs. Michael Farzan and Huihui Ma (The Scripps Research Institute). For neutralization assays, serial dilutions of patient serum samples (primary 1:20 with 3-fold dilution series) or mAbs (up to 50 μg/ml with 5-fold dilution series) were performed in duplicate followed by addition of pseudovirus. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C followed by addition of 293T/ACE2 or TZM.bl/ACE2 target cells (1x10 4 /well). Wells containing cells + pseudovirus (without sample) or cells alone acted as positive and negative infection controls, respectively. Assays were harvested on either day 2 (TZM.bl/ACE2 target cells) or day 3 (293/ACE2 target cells) using Promega Bright-Glo luciferase reagent and luminescence detected with a Perkin-Elmer Victor luminometer. Titers were determined as the serum dilution or mAb concentration that inhibited 50% or 80% virus infection (serum ID 50 /ID 80 or mAb IC 50 /IC 80 titers, respectively).
Similarly, neutralizing activity of mAbs against SARS-CoV pseudovirus as well as SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 was determined using HIV-based lentiviral particles pseudotyped with either SARS-CoV S lacking the C-terminal 21 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail or SARS-CoV-2 S (containing G at position 614) carrying the reported spike mutations in B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 ( Tegally et al., 2020 86.

Pseudotyped particles were generated and neutralization assays were performed as previously described ( Crawford et al., 2020a 14. Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Dingens, A.S. ∙ Eguia, R. ... Dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers in the months after SARS-CoV-2 infection J. Infect. Dis. 2020; Published online September 30, 2020 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020b 15.

Protocol and Reagents for Pseudotyping Lentiviral Particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein for Neutralization Assays Viruses. 2020; 12 :513 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the genes encoding the respective spike proteins were co-transfected with Env-deficient HIV backbone to create pseudotyped lentiviral particles. For neutralization assays, 4- or 5-fold serially diluted purified IgG was incubated with SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus for 1 hour at 37°C. The virus/Ab mixture was added to 293TACE2 target cells and incubated for 48 hours at 37°C, then cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using Britelite Plus (Perkin Elmer). Relative luminescence units (RLUs) were normalized to values derived from cells infected with pseudotyped virus in the absence of Ab. Data were fit to a 5- parameter nonlinear regression in AntibodyDatabase ( West et al., 2013 104. West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Scharf, L. ∙ Horwitz, J. ...

60-80 mL of blood from each donor were processed using Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) in order to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After PBMC isolation we immediately proceeded with isolation of CD20 + B cells using magnetic cell separation (MACS). In brief, cells were resuspended in MACS buffer (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mM EDTA) and stained with mouse anti-human CD20 IgG1 Ab coupled to magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-091-104). After washing and resuspending in MACS buffer cells were added to LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) placed on a magnetic stand and the columns washed 3 times with 3 mL MACS buffer before removing the columns from the magnet and elution of cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then washed and resuspended in Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend, #420201).
CD20 enriched cells were stained with DNA-barcoded Totalseq C Abs (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells underwent Fc receptor blocking with Human TruStain FcX Fc (Biolegend) for 10 minutes at 4°C, after which cells were washed and resuspended in Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend, #420201). Cells from different subjects were then stained with different Totalseq C Abs (Biolegend): 1 (TotalSeq-C0251 anti-human Hashtag 1 Antibody), 2 (TotalSeq-C0252 anti-human Hashtag 2 Antibody), 3 (TotalSeq-C0253 anti-human Hashtag 3 Antibody), 4 (TotalSeq-C0254 anti-human Hashtag 4 Antibody), 6 (TotalSeq-C0256 anti-human Hashtag 6 Antibody), 7 (TotalSeq-C0257 anti-human Hashtag 7 Antibody), 8 (TotalSeq-C0258 anti-human Hashtag 8 Antibody), 10 (TotalSeq-C0260 anti-human Hashtag 10 Antibody). After staining with hashing Abs, cells were washed 3 times in Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend, #420201) and then up to 7 separate samples were combined for staining of antigen binding B cells. For this, the combined samples were stained with either 1 μg/ml biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or 1 μg/ml biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD (See below for protein expression; biotinylation was performed using avitag technology (Avidity) following the manufacturer’s instructions). Cells were simultaneously stained with FITC mouse anti-human CD19 Ab (BD, 340864) and incubated for 20 minutes at 4°C before they were washed and resuspended in PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were then stained with streptavidin-coupled APC (Biolegend #405207) for 5 minutes at 4°C and washed and resuspended in PBS with 5% FBS. Antigen binding B cells were then sorted using a Sony MA900 cell sorter by gating on live cells in the forward scatter and side scatter ( Figures 1 A and 1B) and on CD19-FITC and SARS-CoV-2 S-APC or RBD-APC double-positive cells. After sorting, cells were washed and counted using a hemocytometer and microscopy, before resuspending up to 10,000 cells in a volume of 32 μL for 5′ single cell RNA-Seq (see below).
Cells were separated into droplet emulsions using the Chromium Next GEM Single-cell 5′ Solution (v1.1) and the 10x Chromium Controller. 5,000-10,000 cells were loaded per channel of the Chromium Next GEM single-cell 5′ (v1.1) Chip G. Following lysis of cells, barcoded mRNA reverse transcription, and cDNA amplification, a 0.6X SPRI cleanup was performed, and the supernatant was set aside for Feature Barcoding library construction as instructed by the Chromium NextGEM single-cell V(D)J v1.1 protocol. A final elution of 45 μL was saved for further construction of libraries. Using the saved supernatant of the 0.6X cDNA cleanup, Feature Barcoding libraries were completed according to the 5′ Next GEM (v1.1) Feature Barcoding library construction methods provided by 10x Genomics. Gene expression and V(D)J libraries were created according to manufacturer’s instruction (10x Genomics), which includes enzymatic fragmentation, adaptor ligation, and sample index barcoding steps. The V(D)J libraries were created from the original following the Chromium NextGEM single-cell V(D)J v1.1 protocol.
Gene expression, feature barcoding libraries, and BCR enriched V(D)J libraries were sequenced on a Nextseq500 (Illumina) using a high output 150 cycle flowcell, with the read configuration Read 1: 28 cycles, Read 2: 96 cycles, Index read 1: 8 cycles or sequenced on a HiSeq X (Illumina), using a 150 cycle flowcell with the read configuration: Read 1: 28 cycles, Read 2: 96 cycles, Index read 1: 8 cycles. Feature Barcoding libraries were spiked into the gene expression libraries (at 10%–20% of the sample pool) prior to sequencing. All BCR enriched V(D)J libraries were pooled together and sequenced on a NextSeq500 (Illumina) using the same parameters as previously mentioned.
Ab VDJ heavy chain and VJ light chain sequences of selected mAbs were produced as minigenes and cloned into IgG1 heavy chain, IgA1 heavy chain, IgA2 heavy chain, kappa light chain or lambda light chain expression vectors as previously described ( Wardemann et al., 2003 101. Wardemann, H. ∙ Yurasov, S. ∙ Schaefer, A. ... Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors Science. 2003; 301 :1374-1377 Crossref Scopus (1369) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 99. Wang, Z. ∙ Lorenzi, J.C.C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization by Secretory IgA in vitro bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). After cloning into expression vectors, matching mAb heavy chain and light chain plasmids were co-transfected into Expi293F cells following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, heavy chain plasmid DNA and light chain plasmid DNA were diluted in 1.5ml Opti-Plex Complexation Buffer (Invitrogen) before mixing with 80 μl ExpiFectamine 293 Reagent (Invitrogen) diluted in 1.4 mL Opti-Plex Complexation Buffer (Invitrogen). For dimeric IgA production equal amounts of heavy chain plasmid DNA, light chain plasmid DNA and J chain plasmid DNA were used in the transfection. Mixture was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature before adding to 25 mL of Expi293F cells at a density of 3.0 × 10 6 viable cells/ml and incubation in a shaker incubator according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Enhancer 1 and 2 (150 μl and 1.5 ml, respectively) were added 18 hours post-transfection. mAb containing supernatants were harvested after 7 days by centrifugation of cells at 3,000 g for 20 minutes and transfer of supernatants into 50 mL Falcon tubes (Fisher Scientific). Prior to size exclusion chromatography (see below) IgA dimers were purified from transfection supernatants using peptide M coupled agarose beads (Invivogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
IgA dimers were purified using a 120mL HiLoad™ 16/600 Superdex™ 200pg (Cytiva, #28-9893-35) column on an ÄKTA Pure FPLC system operating at 4°C. After equilibration of the column with PBS each IgA preparation was loaded via a 10mL superloop at a flow rate of 1.25mL/min and 1.5mL fraction were collected. Isolated peaks consistent with IgA multimers, IgA dimers and IgA monomers were detected at 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.5 and 0.5-0.6 column volumes respectively ( Figure S2 H). Fractions spanning all three peaks were collected and evaluated individually by running Criterion™ TGX™ precast gels (Biorad 5671095) under non-reducing conditions with a Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope Prestained Protein Standard (Biorad #1610375) ( Figure S2 I).
mAb concentrations were determined measuring absorbance at 280nm using Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific) or IgG specific ELISA as previously described ( Tiller et al., 2008 90. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ). mAb reactivities to SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV-2 RBD, SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV RBD, MERS-CoV S and MERS-CoV RBD were determined using the same protocol with the following modifications: Antigens were coated on Corning Costar Brand 96-Well EIA/RIA plates at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. mAb binding was then assessed at starting concentrations of 1 μg/ml, 1.1 μg/ml and 1.2 μg/ml for IgG, monomeric IgA and dimeric IgA respectively in order to achieve equal Fab molar concentrations. 3 consecutive 1/4 dilutions were performed. Positive control mAbs used in these assays included BG10-19 for SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (see above), 3B12 (Absolute Antibody #Ab01673-10.0) for MERS-CoV S and MERS-CoV RBD ( Tang et al., 2014 85. Tang, X.C. ∙ Agnihothram, S.S. ∙ Jiao, Y. ... Identification of human neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and their role in virus adaptive evolution Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :E2018-E2026 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) and S227.14 (Absolute Antibody #Ab00263-10.0) for SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV RBD ( Rockx et al., 2008 71. Rockx, B. ∙ Corti, D. ∙ Donaldson, E. ... Structural basis for potent cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody protection against lethal human and zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus challenge J. Virol. 2008; 82 :3220-3235 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antigen specific ELISA results are expressed as AUC using Graphpad PRISM software. Polyreactivity ELISAs were performed as previously described ( Tiller et al., 2008 90. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following modification: In addition to the antigens ssDNA, dsDNA, LPS and insulin ( Tiller et al., 2008 90. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ), streptavidin-coupled APC (Biolegend #405207) was used as a fifth antigen in order to assess potential off target binding against this reagent used for cell sorting (see above). As described previously ( Tiller et al., 2008 90. Tiller, T. ∙ Meffre, E. ∙ Yurasov, S. ... Efficient generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B cells by single cell RT-PCR and expression vector cloning J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329 :112-124 Crossref Scopus (564) PubMed Google Scholar ), polyreactivity is defined as reactivity to 2 or more antigens among the antigens single stranded DNA, double stranded DNA, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or insulin. As previously described, mAbs ED38, JB40 and mGO53 ( Wardemann et al., 2003 101. Wardemann, H. ∙ Yurasov, S. ∙ Schaefer, A. ... Predominant autoantibody production by early human B cell precursors Science. 2003; 301 :1374-1377 Crossref Scopus (1369) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used as strongly polyreactive, intermediately polyreactive and non-polyreactive control mAbs respectively. In ELISA assays including IgG, IgA monomers and IgA dimers, HRP-conjugated goat anti-human kappa and lambda chain Abs (Biorad #STAR127P and #STAR129P) were used as secondary Abs at a 1/5000 dilution.
Off-target mAb binding to baculovirus (BV) particles generated in Sf9 insect cells was tested as previously described ( Hötzel et al., 2012 32. Hötzel, I. ∙ Theil, F.P. ∙ Bernstein, L.J. ... A strategy for risk mitigation of antibodies with fast clearance MAbs. 2012; 4 :753-760 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). A solution of 1% baculovirus in 100mM sodium bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 was adsorbed to a 384-well ELISA plate (Nunc Maxisorp) using a Tecan Freedom Evo2 liquid handling robot and the plate was incubated overnight at 4°C. Following blocking with 0.5% BSA in PBS, 1 μg/ml of IgG was added to the blocked assay. Plates were incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. mAb binding was detected using an HRP-conjugated anti-Human IgG (H&L) secondary Ab (Genscript). ELISA was developed using SuperSignal ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Anti-HIV mAbs NIH45-46 ( Scheid et al., 2011 75. Scheid, J.F. ∙ Mouquet, H. ∙ Ueberheide, B. ... Sequence and structural convergence of broad and potent HIV antibodies that mimic CD4 binding Science. 2011; 333 :1633-1637 Crossref Scopus (791) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 45-46m2 ( Diskin et al., 2013 18. Diskin, R. ∙ Klein, F. ∙ Horwitz, J.A. ... Restricting HIV-1 pathways for escape using rationally designed anti-HIV-1 antibodies J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210 :1235-1249 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used as positive controls and mAb 3BNC117 ( Scheid et al., 2011 75. Scheid, J.F. ∙ Mouquet, H. ∙ Ueberheide, B. ... Sequence and structural convergence of broad and potent HIV antibodies that mimic CD4 binding Science. 2011; 333 :1633-1637 Crossref Scopus (791) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used as negative control. Measurements were performed in quadruplicate and OD values within 1.5-fold the negative control were considered to be negative.
Vero E6-TMPRSS2 were seeded at 10,000 cells per well the day prior to infection in CellCarrier-384 ultra microplate (Perkin Elmer). mAb samples were tested in 4-fold 9-point dilution spots starting at a highest concentration of 100 μg/mL. Serial diluted mAbs were mixed separately with diluted SARS-CoV-2 virus and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 1 hour. mAb-virus complexes were added to the cells in triplicate. Plates were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 48 hours. After that, plates were fixed and inactivated using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were then washed and incubated with diluted anti-SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein mouse Ab (Sino) for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Plates were subsequently incubated with Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (JacksonImmuno) for 45 mins at room temperature, followed by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 (ThermoFisher). The fluorescence images were recorded and analyzed using Opera Phenix High Content Screening System. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) were determined using four parameters logistic regression (GraphPad Prism 8.0).
Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 6P stabilized S trimers ( Hsieh et al., 2020 33. Hsieh, C.L. ∙ Goldsmith, J.A. ∙ Schaub, J.M. ... Structure-based design of prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes Science. 2020; 369 :1501-1505 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) and constructs encoding the sarbecovirus RBDs were conducted as previously described (). Briefly, constructs were purified from supernatants of transiently transfected Expi293F cells (GIBCO) by Ni 2+ -NTA affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and stored at 4°C. IgGs were expressed, purified, and stored as described ( Barnes et al., 2020b 3. Barnes, C.O. ∙ West, Jr., A.P. ∙ Huey-Tubman, K.E. ... Structures of Human Antibodies Bound to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Reveal Common Epitopes and Recurrent Features of Antibodies Cell. 2020; 182 :828-842.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fabs were generated by papain digestion using crystallized papain (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM L-cysteine, pH 7.4 for 30-60 min at 37°C at a 1:100 enzyme:IgG ratio. To remove undigested IgGs and Fc fragments, digested products were applied to a 1-mL HiTrap MabSelect SuRe column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and the flow-through containing cleaved Fabs was collected. Fabs were further purified by SEC using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in TBS before concentrating and storage at 4°C.
Purified Fab and S 6P trimer were incubated at a 1.1:1 molar ratio per protomer on ice for 30 minutes prior to deposition on a freshly glow-discharged 300 mesh, 1.2/1.3 UltrAuFoil grid. Immediately before 3 μl of complex was applied to the grid, fluorinated octyl-malotiside was added to the Fab-S complex to a final detergent concentration of 0.02% w/v, resulting in a final complex concentration of 3 mg/ml. Samples were vitrified in 100% liquid ethane using a Mark IV Vitrobot after blotting for 3 s with Whatman No. 1 filter paper at 22°C and 100% humidity.
Data collection and processing followed a similar workflow to what has been previously described in detail ( Barnes et al., 2020a 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, micrographs were collected on a Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 200 kV for all Fab-S complexes. Data were collected using SerialEM automated data collection software ( Mastronarde, 2005 51. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (1782) PubMed Google Scholar ) and movies were recorded with K3 camera (Gatan). Data collections parameters are summarized in Table S5 . For all datasets, cryo-EM movies were patch motion corrected for beam-induced motion including dose-weighting within cryoSPARC v2.15 ( Punjani et al., 2017 69. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (1086) PubMed Google Scholar ) after binning super resolution movies. The non-dose-weighted images were used to estimate CTF parameters using cryoSPARC implementation of the Patch CTF job. Processing for all datasets was carried out in a similar fashion. Briefly, an initial set of particles was picked based on templates from 2D classification of blob picked particles on a small sub-set of images. This set was pared down through several rounds of 3D classification. An ab initio job on a small good subset of these particles revealed distinct states and junk particles. Full set of particles was heterogeneously refined against distinct states, as well as a junk class acting as a trap for bad particles. Particles from each were separately refined using non-uniform refinement in C1 symmetry. Particles from distinct states were re-extracted without binning and were further refined separately in several rounds of 3D classification. Particles were subdivided into groups based on beam-tilt, refined separately for CTF parameters and aberration correction. For all states, a soft mask (3-pixel extension, 6-pixel soft edge) was generated to exclude Fab constant domains for local non-uniform refinements. To improve the density for the BG1-22 – RBD, BG7-20 – RBD, and BG1-24 – RBD interfaces, a soft mask was generated around the RBD and Fab variable domain and particles were subjected to non-uniform local refinement in cryoSPARC. The resolution at the Fab-RBD interface was modestly improved and used to model coordinates in the overall Fab – S trimer complex structures. Overall reported resolutions are based on gold standard FSC calculations.
Coordinates for initial complexes were generated by docking individual chains from reference structures into cryo-EM density using UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al., 2018 23. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (840) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see Table S5 for PDB coordinates). Models were then refined into cryo-EM maps rigid body and real space refinement with morphing in Phenix ( Terwilliger et al., 2018 87. Terwilliger, T.C. ∙ Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ... A fully automatic method yielding initial models from high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :905-908 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequence-updated models were built manually in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 22. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (14145) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then refined using iterative rounds of real-space refinement in Phenix and Coot. Glycans were modeled at potential N -linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) in Coot using ‘blurred’ maps processed with a variety of B-factors generated in cryoSPARC v2.15. Validation of model coordinates was performed using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 9. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (8562) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S5 ).
Crystallization trials for a stoichiometric complex of BG4-25 – SARS-CoV2 RBD – CR3022 were carried out at room temperature using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of the Fab-RBD complex and reservoir using a TTP LabTech Mosquito robot and commercially-available screens (Hampton Research). Crystals were obtained in 0.05 M citric acid, 0.05 M BIS-TRIS propane pH 5.0 and 16% polyethylene glycol 3350 and quickly cryo-protected in a solution matching the reservoir + 20% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected for Fab-RBD complex at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamline 12-2 on a Pilatus 6M pixel detector (Dectris). Data from a single crystal were indexed and integrated in XDS ( Kabsch, 2010 37. Kabsch, W. XDS Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (9577) PubMed Google Scholar ) and merged using AIMLESS in CCP4 ( Winn et al., 2011 106. Winn, M.D. ∙ Ballard, C.C. ∙ Cowtan, K.D. ... Overview of the CCP4 suite and current developments Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :235-242 Crossref Scopus (8092) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S6 ). The Fab-RBD complex structure was determined by molecular replacement in PHASER ( McCoy et al., 2007 53. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (12830) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Fab and RBD coordinates from individual components of PDB 6XC3 (CC12.1 Fab – CR3022 Fab – SARS-CoV2 RBD) as search models after trimming heavy chain and light chain CDR loops for CC12.1 Fab. Coordinates were refined using rigid body and B-group refinement in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (14353) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by cycles of manual building in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 22. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (14145) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S6 ).
CDR lengths and Kabot numbering were calculated based on IMGT definitions ( Lefranc et al., 2015 45. Lefranc, M.P. ∙ Giudicelli, V. ∙ Duroux, P. ... IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® 25 years on Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D413-D422 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structure figures were made with UCSF ChimeraX. Local resolution maps were calculated using cryoSPARC v 2.15. Buried surface areas were calculated using PDBePISA ( Krissinel and Henrick, 2007 41. Krissinel, E. ∙ Henrick, K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 :774-797 Crossref Scopus (5909) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a 1.4 Å probe. Potential hydrogen bonds were assigned as interactions that were < 4.0Å and with A-D-H angle > 90°. Potential van der Waals interactions between atoms were assigned as interactions that were < 4.0Å. Hydrogen bond and van der Waals interaction assignments are tentative due to resolution limitations.
SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). ACE2 microbody ( Tada et al., 2020 82. Tada, T. ∙ Fan, C. ∙ Chen, J.S. ... An ACE2 Microbody Containing a Single Immunoglobulin Fc Domain Is a Potent Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Cell Rep. 2020; 33 :108528 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) was immobilized on a CM5 chip by primary amine chemistry at pH 4.5 to a final response level of ~1000 resonance units (RUs). Fabs were complexed with 100 nM SARS2 S 6P or SARS2 RBD at a 10:1 molar ratio and incubated for a minimum of 1 hour. Antigen or Fab-antigen complex was injected over immobilized ACE2 microbody surface at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for a contact time of 300 s. Sensorgrams were buffer corrected using an injection of 0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20 buffer.
Binding of Fabs to SARS-CoV-2 RBDs containing single mutations or to sarbecovirus RBDs was evaluated by ELISA. RBD antigens (mutant or wild-type) were adsorbed to 384-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Sigma) at a concentration of 2 μg/mL overnight. Plates were blocked with 3% BSA in TBS-T (TBS with 0.05% Tween20) for 1 h at room temperature, then 5-fold serial dilutions starting at 10 μg/mL of Fab were added. Plates were washed with TBS-T and bound Fab was detected using an HRP-conjugated secondary Ab (Genscript) and SuperSignal ELISA Femto Substrate (Thermo Scientific). AUC for each Fab-antigen pair was calculated using Graphpad PRISM software. Fold decrease in AUC was calculated relative to SARS-CoV2 RBD AUC for the same Fab. Data shown are representative of two independent experiments.
SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles were generated as previously described ( Robbiani et al., 2020 70. Robbiani, D.F. ∙ Gaebler, C. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals Nature. 2020; 584 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmidt et al., 2020 76. Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20201181 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3ΔEnv-nanoluc and pSARS-CoV-2-S Δ19 . For generation of RBD mutant pseudoviruses, pSARS-CoV-2-S Δ19 carrying indicated spike mutations was used instead ( Muecksch et al., 2021 58. Muecksch, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Barnes, C.O. ... Development of potency, breadth and resilience to viral escape mutations in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2021 100. Wang, Z. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ... mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants Nature. 2021; 592 :616-622 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weisblum et al., 2020 102. Weisblum, Y. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Zhang, F. ... Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants eLife. 2020; 9 :e61312 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered and stored at −80°C.
Four-fold serially diluted mAbs were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus for 1 h at 37°C. The mixture was subsequently incubated with HT1080 Ace2 cl14 cells ( Schmidt et al., 2020 76. Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20201181 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) for 48 h after which cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis 5 × reagent (Promega). Nanoluc Luciferase activity in lysates was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with the Glomax Navigator (Promega). The obtained relative luminescence units were normalized to those derived from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus in the absence of mAbs. The half-maximal and 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 and IC 90 ) were determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression (least-squares regression method without weighting; constraints: top = 1, bottom = 0) (GraphPad Prism).
293T/ACE2.cl22 ( Schmidt et al., 2020 76. Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20201181 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells have been tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma. rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP chimeric virus stocks were generated by infecting 293T/ACE2.cl22 cells. Supernatant was harvested 1 day post infection (dpi), cleared from cellular debris, aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Two plaque purified variants designated rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP 1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP 2E1 that encode F157S/R685M (1D7) and D215G/R683G (2E1) substitutions were used in these studies ( Schmidt et al., 2020 76. Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20201181 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). For BG10-19 selection experiments, the virus was passaged multiple times in the presence of 1 μg/ml or 5 μg/ml of mAb. At passage 4, virus was allowed to replicate in the presence of mAb until all the cells were infected then harvested. The virus was then passaged in the presence of mAb for a fifth and final time before supernatant was harvested for further analysis. To isolate individual mutants, the supernatants of passage 5 were serially diluted and individual viral foci were isolated by limiting dilution in 96-well plates.
For the identification of putative mAb resistance mutations, RNA was isolated from aliquots of supernatant containing selected viral populations and isolates using NucleoSpin 96 Virus Core Kit (Macherey-Nagel). The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cDNA was amplified using KOD Xtreme Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Millipore Sigma) and primers flanking the entire S-encoding sequence. The PCR products were purified and sequenced using Sanger-sequencing.
To measure neutralizing activity, 40 μg/ml mAb was five-fold serially diluted in 96-well plates over 7 dilutions. Thereafter, approximately 5 × 10 4 infectious units of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP WT or mutant isolates were mixed with BG10-19 at a 1:1 ratio and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in a 96-well plate. The mixture was then added to 293T/ACE2.cl22 target cells plated at 1 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl medium in 96-well plates the previous day. Thus, the final starting dilution was10 μg/ml. Cells were then cultured for 16 h, then harvested for flow cytometry.
mRNA and VDJ sequence reads were mapped to the reference human genome GRCh38-3.0.0 with the cloud-based Cumulus workflows ( Li et al., 2020 48. Li, B. ∙ Gould, J. ∙ Yang, Y. ... Cumulus provides cloud-based data analysis for large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :793-798 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the CellRanger 3.0.2 software pipeline. Cells with both high-quality VDJ sequence and transcriptome information were kept for the downstream analysis by filtering out the cells which had less than 300 detected genes or which had poor quality VDJ contig information defined by i) being non-productive by 10x standards, ii) having more than four productive VDJ contigs, iii) having less than three filtered UMIs. For the transcriptome analysis, batch effects were removed with the ComBat algorithm ( Johnson et al., 2007 36. Johnson, W.E. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Rabinovic, A. Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using empirical Bayes methods Biostatistics. 2007; 8 :118-127 Crossref Scopus (3117) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in SVA R Package version 3.38.0. For the transcriptome mRNA count normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, cell cycle scoring, cluster marker genes detection and differential gene expression analysis steps Seurat R package ( Butler et al., 2018 5. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (2282) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stuart et al., 2019 80. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1654) PubMed Google Scholar ) was employed. For the normalization step gene expression counts for each cell were divided by the total counts for that cell and multiplied by 1e6, which was then log-transformed using log1p. Dimensionality reduction was done by PCA with selecting 50 first principal components.
For clustering of the cells into transcriptome clusters, first the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graph of the cells was constructed. Second, this kNN graph was used to generate the shared nearest neighbor (sNN) graph by calculating Jaccard index between every cell and its k nearest neighbors. Third, the leiden algorithm ( Traag et al., 2019 93. Traag, V.A. ∙ Waltman, L. ∙ van Eck, N.J. From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :5233 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to find the clusters of the cells based on the generated sNN graph.
Cell cycle scoring was done by calculating the module scores of the cell cycle genes defined in Tirosh et al. (2016) 91. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Crossref Scopus (1321) PubMed Google Scholar . Positive cluster marker genes and differentially expressed genes were detected with a log-fold change threshold of 0.25, where only the genes that were detected in a minimum fraction of 20% in either of the six transcriptome populations were considered. Expression levels of Ig genes were discarded during the clustering and differential gene expression analysis steps. Source codes for scRNA-seq analyses were deposited in Github ( https://github.com/EraslanBas/Sars_Cov2_Antibodies ).
10x V(D)J contig assembly algorithm takes many forms of noise specific to scRNA-seq data into account while generating the assembled V(D)J sequences ( https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/software/pipelines/latest/algorithms/assembly ). Nevertheless, only the cells with high-quality V(D)J contig sequences were selected and V(D)J gene annotations were assigned by using IGBLAST (version 1.14.0) software with the Change-O R package ( Gupta et al., 2015 26. Gupta, N.T. ∙ Vander Heiden, J.A. ∙ Uduman, M. ... Change-O: a toolkit for analyzing large-scale B cell immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3356-3358 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Donor specific B cell clones were identified by the Change-O R package ( Gupta et al., 2015 26. Gupta, N.T. ∙ Vander Heiden, J.A. ∙ Uduman, M. ... Change-O: a toolkit for analyzing large-scale B cell immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3356-3358 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ), where the appropriate threshold for trimming the hierarchical clustering into B cell clones was found by inspecting the bimodal distribution of the distance between each sequence in the data and its nearest-neighbor.
Mutation inference based on the scRNA-seq VDJ sequences of the donor and the control cells ( Rubelt et al., 2012 73. Rubelt, F. ∙ Sievert, V. ∙ Knaust, F. ... Onset of immune senescence defined by unbiased pyrosequencing of human immunoglobulin mRNA repertoires PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e49774 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed by the Shazam R Package ( Yaari et al., 2012 111. Yaari, G. ∙ Uduman, M. ∙ Kleinstein, S.H. Quantifying selection in high-throughput Immunoglobulin sequencing data sets Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :e134 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ) where the region definition parameter was set to be “IMGT_V_BY_SEGMENTS” which provides no subdivisons and treats the entire V segment as a single region.
CDRH3 length was defined based on IMGT definition ( Lefranc et al., 2015 45. Lefranc, M.P. ∙ Giudicelli, V. ∙ Duroux, P. ... IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® 25 years on Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D413-D422 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the addition of two conserved amino acid residues that were added to assist in clonal analysis ( Nouri and Kleinstein, 2018 63. Nouri, N. ∙ Kleinstein, S.H. A spectral clustering-based method for identifying clones from high-throughput B cell repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :i341-i349 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). This addition was corrected for all analyses involving specific CDRH3 length, such as selection of VH3-53/3-66 mAbs with CDRH3 shorter than 14 amino acid length.
CDRH3 amino acid charges were calculated by the Alakazam R package ( Gupta et al., 2015 26. Gupta, N.T. ∙ Vander Heiden, J.A. ∙ Uduman, M. ... Change-O: a toolkit for analyzing large-scale B cell immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3356-3358 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the method of Moore ( Moore, 1985 55. Moore, D.S. Amino acid and peptide net charges: A simple calculational procedure Biochem. Educ. 1985; 13 :10-11 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) excluding the N terminus and C terminus charges, and normalizing by the number of informative positions. Hydrophobicity scores were calculated with the Alakazam R package using the method of Kyte and Doolittle ( Kyte and Doolittle, 1982 43. Kyte, J. ∙ Doolittle, R.F. A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157 :105-132 Crossref Scopus (16423) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Shannon entropy values were calculated using Alakazam R package. For each donor the transcriptome cluster specific Hill diversity index, proposed in ( Hill, 1973 29. Hill, M.O. Diversity and Evenness: A Unifying Notation and Its Consequences Ecology. 1973; 54 :427-432 Crossref Google Scholar ), improved by ( Chao et al., 2014 7. Chao, A. ∙ Gotelli, N.J. ∙ Hsieh, T.C. ... Rarefaction and extrapolation with Hill numbers: a framework for sampling and estimation in species diversity studies Ecol. Monogr. 2014; 84 :45-67 Crossref Scopus (1182) Google Scholar , 2015 8. Chao, A. ∙ Hsieh, T.C. ∙ Chazdon, R.L. ... Unveiling the species-rank abundance distribution by generalizing the Good-Turing sample coverage theory Ecology. 2015; 96 :1189-1201 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) was calculated by setting the diversity order equal to 1 with Alakazam R package. For each run the number of bootstrap realizations is set to be 400, and the minimum number of observations to sample is set to be 10. Source codes for Ab repertoire analyses were deposited in Github ( https://github.com/EraslanBas/Sars_Cov2_Antibodies ).
Inferred somatic mutations in the V gene segment of VH3-53/VH3-66 mAbs were counted for the IgG + mAbs with CDRH3 lengths less than 14 amino acids from SARS-CoV-2 binding B cells across 14 subjects, listing only those sites where the frequency was > 10% in either the IgG + set or in the repertoire comparison. The repertoire comparison set of human VH3-53/VH3-66 sequences was taken from the sequence read archive of Rubelt et al. (2012) 73. Rubelt, F. ∙ Sievert, V. ∙ Knaust, F. ... Onset of immune senescence defined by unbiased pyrosequencing of human immunoglobulin mRNA repertoires PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e49774 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar and alignments were performed using MAFFT software ( Katoh et al., 2019 38. Katoh, K. ∙ Rozewicki, J. ∙ Yamada, K.D. MAFFT online service: multiple sequence alignment, interactive sequence choice and visualization Brief. Bioinform. 2019; 20 :1160-1166 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ).
