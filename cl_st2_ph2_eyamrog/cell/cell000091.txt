Title: Endocrine-Exocrine Signaling Drives Obesity-Associated Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma


Abstract: Summary

Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), yet how and when obesity contributes to PDAC progression is not well understood. Leveraging an autochthonous mouse model, we demonstrate a causal and reversible role for obesity in early PDAC progression, showing that obesity markedly enhances tumorigenesis, while genetic or dietary induction of weight loss intercepts cancer development. Molecular analyses of human and murine samples define microenvironmental consequences of obesity that foster tumorigenesis rather than new driver gene mutations, including significant pancreatic islet cell adaptation in obesity-associated tumors. Specifically, we identify aberrant beta cell expression of the peptide hormone cholecystokinin (Cck) in response to obesity and show that islet Cck promotes oncogenic Kras -driven pancreatic ductal tumorigenesis. Our studies argue that PDAC progression is driven by local obesity-associated changes in the tumor microenvironment and implicate endocrine-exocrine signaling beyond insulin in PDAC development.

Section: Introduction

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is expected to become the second within the next decade ( Rahib et al., 2014; Siegel et al., 2020 64. Rahib, L. ∙ Smith, B.D. ∙ Aizenberg, R. ...

Siegel, R.L. ∙ Miller, K.D. ∙ Jemal, A. Cancer statistics, 2020 CA Cancer J. Clin. 2020; 70 :7-30 Crossref Scopus (15535) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the development of combination chemotherapy, targeted small molecules, and immunotherapies that have revolutionized cancer care, long-term survival in PDAC remains low at ∼10% ( Ryan et al., 2014; Siegel et al., 2020 67.

Cancer statistics, 2020 CA Cancer J. Clin. 2020; 70 :7-30 Crossref Scopus (15535) PubMed Google Scholar ). In search of drug targets, genomic studies have identified frequent mutations in the proto-oncogene KRAS , occurring in >90% of human PDAC tumors ( Bailey et al., 2016; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 3. Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Crossref Scopus (2382) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unfortunately, no effective direct KRAS inhibitors are currently approved for clinical use ( Papke and Der, 2017 61. Papke, B. ∙ Der, C.J. Drugging RAS: Know the enemy Science. 2017; 355 :1158-1163 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, our recent work demonstrated that PDAC cells can survive genetic ablation of KRAS both in vitro and in vivo ( Chen et al., 2018; Muzumdar et al., 2017 17. Chen, P.Y. ∙ Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Dorans, K.J. ... Adaptive and Reversible Resistance to Kras Inhibition in Pancreatic Cancer Cells Cancer Res. 2018; 78 :985-1002 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Chen, P.Y. ∙ Dorans, K.J. ... Survival of pancreatic cancer cells lacking KRAS function Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1090 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), arguing that resistance will subvert even the very best KRAS inhibitors. Therefore, alternative paradigms beyond genetic factors need to be explored to develop novel therapeutic and preventative strategies for PDAC.
Epidemiologic studies in prospective human cohorts have shown that body-mass index (BMI), a surrogate measure of obesity, is associated with increased PDAC risk, more advanced disease at diagnosis, and worse survival ( Larsson et al., 2007; Yuan et al., 2013 39.

Oncol. 2013; 31 :4229-4234 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, how obesity contributes to PDAC development remains poorly understood. Previous research showed that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity promotes tumor progression in transplant and autochthonous models of PDAC ( Incio et al., 2016; Khasawneh et al., 2009; Philip et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2017; Zaytouni et al., 2017; Zyromski et al., 2009 15.

Khasawneh, J. ∙ Schulz, M.D. ∙ Walch, A. ... Inflammation and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation link obesity to early tumor promotion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chang, H.H. ∙ Moro, A. ∙ Takakura, K. ... Incidence of pancreatic cancer is dramatically increased by a high fat, high calorie diet in KrasG12D mice PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0184455 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar 26.

USA. 2009; 106 :3354-3359 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ) as potential mechanisms. These studies were limited by slow obesity onset in HFD models as well as variations in fat content, types of fat, and age of administration in HFD protocols, all of which can confound results ( Speakman, 2019 74. Speakman, J.R. Use of high-fat diets to study rodent obesity as a model of human obesity Int. J. Obes. 2019; 43 :1491-1492 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, these approaches provided no information on whether, and at what point, weight loss or other anti-obesity interventions might influence PDAC progression, despite significant clinical implications ( Massetti et al., 2017 49. Massetti, G.M. ∙ Dietz, W.H. ∙ Richardson, L.C. Excessive Weight Gain, Obesity, and Cancer: Opportunities for Clinical Intervention JAMA. 2017; 318 :1975-1976 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To overcome these important limitations, we developed a rapid and reversible autochthonous model of obesity-associated PDAC. We demonstrate that obesity plays a causal and reversible role in early PDAC progression. We further identify aberrant expression of the hormone cholecystokinin (Cck) in islet beta cells in tumors as an adaptive response to obesity and show that islet Cck overexpression itself promotes pancreatic ductal tumorigenesis. Together, these studies link obesity, changes in the local microenvironment, and tumorigenesis through a previously unappreciated endocrine-exocrine signaling axis in PDAC development.

Section: Results

To model obesity-associated pancreatic cancer, we crossed leptin-deficient ( ob/ob ) mice with KC ( Pdx1-Cre; Kras LSL-G12D/WT ) mice predisposed to the development of precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) ( Hingorani et al., 2003 23. Hingorani, S.R. ∙ Petricoin, E.F. ∙ Maitra, A. ... Preinvasive and invasive ductal pancreatic cancer and its early detection in the mouse Cancer Cell. 2003; 4 :437-450 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1926) PubMed Google Scholar ) to yield KC; ob/ob ( KCO ) mice ( Figure 1 A). Unlike HFD models, ob/ob mice exhibit early onset obesity due to impaired appetite suppression and decreased metabolism ( Friedman, 2019 20. Friedman, J.M. Leptin and the endocrine control of energy balance Nat Metab. 2019; 1 :754-764 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). KCO mice were obese and developed increased primary ductal tumor burden ( Figures 1 B–1D). They also showed enhanced progression to adenocarcinoma and markedly shortened survival compared to non-obese KC mice ( Figures 1 E and 1F). We similarly observed decreased survival using a distinct obesity model due to leptin receptor mutation ( db/db ) ( Figures S1 A and S1B). These phenotypes were significantly more severe than seen in HFD models ( Khasawneh et al., 2009; Philip et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2017 15. Chang, H.H. ∙ Moro, A. ∙ Takakura, K. ... Incidence of pancreatic cancer is dramatically increased by a high fat, high calorie diet in KrasG12D mice PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0184455 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Khasawneh, J. ∙ Schulz, M.D. ∙ Walch, A. ... Inflammation and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation link obesity to early tumor promotion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :3354-3359 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Philip, B. ∙ Roland, C.L. ∙ Daniluk, J. ... A high-fat diet activates oncogenic Kras and COX2 to induce development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in mice Gastroenterology. 2013; 145 :1449-1458 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ), corresponding to the degree of obesity. Consistent with human epidemiologic studies that demonstrate an association between obesity and pancreatic cancer, but not lung cancer ( Lauby-Secretan et al., 2016 40. Lauby-Secretan, B. ∙ Scoccianti, C. ∙ Loomis, D. ..., International Agency for Research on Cancer Handbook Working Group Body Fatness and Cancer--Viewpoint of the IARC Working Group N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375 :794-798 Crossref Scopus (2159) PubMed Google Scholar ), obesity induced by neither HFD nor ob/ob genotype shortened survival in lung cancer initiated by oncogenic Kras ( Figures S1 C–1F). Thus, these results support a specific effect of obesity on Kras -driven PDAC progression.
We chose the ob/ob model because it affords rapid reversal of the obesity phenotype through leptin restoration to study the effects of weight loss on PDAC development. We generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that directs sustained leptin secretion (AAV-Leptin) following a single intramuscular injection ( Figures 2 A, S2 A, and S2B). AAV-Leptin reversed multiple phenotypes of leptin deficiency, including obesity, hyperglycemia, and infertility ( Figures 2 B, S2 C, and S2D), as seen with leptin protein replacement ( Friedman, 2019 20. Friedman, J.M. Leptin and the endocrine control of energy balance Nat Metab. 2019; 1 :754-764 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, early AAV-Leptin administration impeded tumor progression proportional to the degree of weight loss ( Figures 2 C and 2D). In contrast, late AAV-Leptin administration (following advanced tumor development) induced weight loss without impacting survival ( Figures S2 E and S2F). Moreover, leptin induced on-target downstream signaling in advanced murine PDAC cells in vitro but did not alter cell viability ( Figures S2 G and S2H). These data support a stage-specific effect of obesity on early PDAC development. Experiments with caloric restriction argue that it is weight loss itself that impacts tumor progression, rather than leptin signaling. Young KCO mice subject to caloric restriction exhibited significantly reduced tumor burden compared to mice fed ad libitum ( Figures 2 E and 2F), demonstrating the potential to halt or delay obesity-driven PDAC progression with weight loss.
We next sought to identify the mechanisms by which obesity contributes to pancreatic tumorigenesis in this model. We postulated that obesity might induce DNA damage in the setting of enhanced oxidative stress ( Usman and Volpi, 2018 77. Usman, M. ∙ Volpi, E.V. DNA damage in obesity: Initiator, promoter and predictor of cancer Mutat. Res. 2018; 778 :23-37 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that tumor progression in KCO mice would depend on additional driver gene mutations beyond oncogenic Kras . Precedent for this hypothesis is provided by acceleration of oncogenic Kras -induced pancreatic tumor development in mice with inactivating mutations in Trp53 , Cdkn2a , or Smad4 ( Bardeesy et al., 2006a, 2006b; Hingorani et al., 2005; Muzumdar et al., 2016 8.

Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Crossref Scopus (2382) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, survival of KCO mice was comparable to what we previously observed ( Muzumdar et al., 2016 56. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Dorans, K.J. ∙ Chung, K.M. ... Clonal dynamics following p53 loss of heterozygosity in Kras-driven cancers Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :12685 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) in KPC mice ( Pdx1-Cre; Kras LSL-G12D/WT ; p53 flox/WT or Pdx1- Cre; Kras LSL-G12D/WT ; p53 LSL-R172H/WT ) harboring heterozygous mutations in p53 (p = 0.93, log rank test). Surprisingly, however, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed persistent tumor suppressor protein expression, and exome sequencing confirmed the absence of inactivating point mutations in the associated genes ( Figure 3 ; Table S1 ). Furthermore, we did not observe recurrent pathogenic mutations in other known PDAC ( Bailey et al., 2016; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 3. Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Crossref Scopus (2382) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ) or pan-cancer driver genes ( Bailey et al., 2018 4. Bailey, M.H. ∙ Tokheim, C. ∙ Porta-Pardo, E. ... Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations Cell. 2018; 173 :371-385.e318 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1221) PubMed Google Scholar ) in KCO tumors ( Tables S2 and S3 ). Contrary to our expectations, these data argue that additional driver gene mutations are not required for obesity to promote pancreatic cancer development. To determine if a similar phenomenon is evident in human tumors, we performed targeted exome sequencing and IHC to evaluate alterations of KRAS , TP53 , CDKN2A/p16 , and SMAD4 in 184 human PDAC tumors with known patient BMI at diagnosis ( Table S4 ). Although we observed a significant increase in SMAD4 loss with elevated BMI, the total number of driver gene alterations per tumor, which we previously showed predicted worse outcomes in patients with localized PDAC ( Qian et al., 2018 63. Qian, Z.R. ∙ Rubinson, D.A. ∙ Nowak, J.A. ... Association of Alterations in Main Driver Genes With Outcomes of Patients With Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma JAMA Oncol. 2018; 4 :e173420 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not significantly differ across categories of BMI ( Table S5 ). Together, these data suggest that obesity may promote pancreatic tumorigenesis independent of new driver mutations.
To elucidate potential non-mutational mechanisms of PDAC progression, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on pancreata from obese KCO and non-obese KC and KPC mice exhibiting comparable tumor burden ( Table S6 ). Using independent component analysis (ICA), an unsupervised blind source separation technique ( Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000; Muzumdar et al., 2017 25. Hyvärinen, A. ∙ Oja, E. Independent component analysis: algorithms and applications Neural Netw. 2000; 13 :411-430 Crossref Scopus (6896) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Chen, P.Y. ∙ Dorans, K.J. ... Survival of pancreatic cancer cells lacking KRAS function Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1090 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified gene expression signatures associated with inflammation and fibrosis as upregulated in KCO compared to KC / KPC mice ( Figures 4 A–4D; Table S6 ), likely representing obesity-associated alterations in the tumor microenvironment. We confirmed abundant extracellular matrix deposition and immune cell infiltration by histologic analyses of KCO tumors ( Figure 4 E). To determine human relevance, we ranked primary human PDAC tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 13. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on gene expression correlation to these KCO signatures. We classified tumors using previously defined molecular subtypes ( Bailey et al., 2016 3. Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Crossref Scopus (2382) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found the KCO -correlated tumors to be significantly enriched with the immunogenic subtype ( Figure 4 F), which is similarly associated with immune cell infiltration ( Bailey et al., 2016; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 3. Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Crossref Scopus (2382) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data revealed that alterations in the fibroinflammatory microenvironment are a major feature of obesity-associated pancreatic tumors and are consistent with prior work using HFD models ( Incio et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2017 15. Chang, H.H. ∙ Moro, A. ∙ Takakura, K. ... Incidence of pancreatic cancer is dramatically increased by a high fat, high calorie diet in KrasG12D mice PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0184455 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar 26.

Obesity-Induced Inflammation and Desmoplasia Promote Pancreatic Cancer Progression and Resistance to Chemotherapy Cancer Discov. 2016; 6 :852-869 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Consequently, we tested the effects of anti-inflammatory (aspirin) and anti-fibrotic (metformin) ( Chen et al., 2017; Rangarajan et al., 2018 16. Chen, K. ∙ Qian, W. ∙ Jiang, Z. ... Metformin suppresses cancer initiation and progression in genetic mouse models of pancreatic cancer Mol. Cancer. 2017; 16 :131 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar 65.

Med. 2018; 24 :1121-1127 Crossref Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ) drugs on tumor progression in KCO mice. We chose these specific agents because they have been shown to mitigate pancreatic cancer risk in selected ( Li et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015 43. Li, D. ∙ Yeung, S.C. ∙ Hassan, M.M. ... Antidiabetic therapies affect risk of pancreatic cancer Gastroenterology. 2009; 137 :482-488 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (524) PubMed Google Scholar 90. Zhang, Y.P. ∙ Wan, Y.D. ∙ Sun, Y.L. ... Aspirin might reduce the incidence of pancreatic cancer: A meta-analysis of observational studies Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :15460 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), but not all ( Khalaf et al., 2018 35. Khalaf, N. ∙ Yuan, C. ∙ Hamada, T. ... Regular Use of Aspirin or Non-Aspirin Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Is Not Associated With Risk of Incident Pancreatic Cancer in Two Large Cohort Studies Gastroenterology. 2018; 154 :1380-1390.e1385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), patient cohorts and are in widespread clinical use for other indications. Remarkably, neither aspirin nor metformin impacted tumor progression, immune cell infiltration, or fibrosis in KCO mice ( Figure S3 ), indicating that these agents may have a limited role in preventing obesity-driven PDAC. Furthermore, these data left open the possibility that the obesity-associated changes in the fibroinflammatory microenvironment could be a consequence rather than a cause of pancreatic tumorigenesis. Therefore, we sought alternative mechanisms that may contribute to PDAC development in obesity.
One of the most notable RNA-seq results was upregulation of genes associated with pancreatic islet cell function in KCO compared to KC/KPC pancreata ( Figure 5 A). Although expression levels of general neuroendocrine markers were mostly unchanged in KCO pancreata ( Figure 5 B), we observed a marked increase in the expression of genes encoding islet prohormones, proteases that process them, and secretory granule proteins ( Figure 5 C). We confirmed gene expression data by IHC on islets in tumor-bearing mice. While glucagon (Gcg) and its proteolytic product GLP-1 are typically expressed in peripherally located α cells in non-obese rodents ( Barreto et al., 2010 10. Barreto, S.G. ∙ Carati, C.J. ∙ Toouli, J. ... The islet-acinar axis of the pancreas: more than just insulin Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299 :G10-G22 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), KCO mice displayed an expansion of Gcg and GLP-1 production throughout islets ( Figure 5 D). These observations are consistent with prior research demonstrating increased GLP-1 secretion from islets of obese humans and mice ( Linnemann et al., 2015 46. Linnemann, A.K. ∙ Neuman, J.C. ∙ Battiola, T.J. ... Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Regulates Cholecystokinin Production in β-Cells to Protect From Apoptosis Mol. Endocrinol. 2015; 29 :978-987 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, our results support islet adaptation to enhance hormone production, processing, and secretion in the setting of obesity.
Given these findings, we postulated that enhanced local insulin secretion may promote pancreatic tumorigenesis in obese mice. Although ob/ob mice exhibited systemic hyperinsulinemia ( Figure S4 A), glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by primary islets derived from ob/ob mice was reduced ( Figures S4 B–S4D), consistent with severely impaired local insulin secretion. Furthermore, analysis of insulin receptor phosphorylation suggested comparable signaling activation in tumor cells from both KC and KCO mice ( Figure S4 E). These data argue against local increases in insulin or insulin signaling as a primary driver of pancreatic tumorigenesis. We tested this hypothesis further by treating KCO mice with the sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin, which blocks kidney reabsorption of glucose and attenuates obesity-associated hyperglycemia. Slc5a2 (SGLT2) knockout in db/db mice improves islet function and maintenance by reducing beta cell glucotoxicity ( Jurczak et al., 2011; Jurczak et al., 2018 31. Jurczak, M.J. ∙ Lee, H.Y. ∙ Birkenfeld, A.L. ... SGLT2 deletion improves glucose homeostasis and preserves pancreatic beta-cell function Diabetes. 2011; 60 :890-898 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Jurczak, M.J. ∙ Saini, S. ∙ Ioja, S. ... SGLT2 knockout prevents hyperglycemia and is associated with reduced pancreatic β-cell death in genetically obese mice Islets. 2018; 10 :181-189 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, treatment with dapagliflozin reduced serum glucose and maintained higher circulating insulin and proinsulin (C-peptide) levels in KCO mice ( Figures S4 F and S4G), indicating preserved beta cell function. The variable effect of dapagliflozin on the maintenance of insulin production across KCO mice ( Figure S4 G) allowed us to quantitatively compare the relationship between insulin and tumor development in this model. We anticipated that if insulin was a main driver of tumorigenesis, tumor burden would be enhanced proportional to insulin production. Contrary to this hypothesis, C-peptide levels inversely correlated with tumor burden ( Figure S4 H), suggesting that alternative changes in islet hormone expression may play a greater role in tumor development.
To decipher islet hormone expression at higher resolution, we performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on islets isolated from congenic C57/B6 wild-type and ob/ob mice. Visualization using Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE) ( Moon et al., 2019 53. Moon, K.R. ∙ van Dijk, D. ∙ Wang, Z. ...

Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :1482-1492 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ), a method for dimensionality reduction of single-cell data, displayed clusters corresponding to single hormone-expressing beta (insulin), alpha (glucagon), delta (somatostatin), and PP (pancreatic polypeptide [Ppy]) cells ( Figure 6 A). To characterize the differences between cells captured from ob/ob and wild-type islets, we used the newly developed Manifold Enhancement of Latent Dimensions (MELD) package ( Burkhardt et al., 2019 12. Burkhardt, D.B. ∙ Stanley, J.S. ∙ Perdigoto, A.L. ... Quantifying the effect of experimental perturbations in single-cell RNA-sequencing data using graph signal processing bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), which derives a likelihood score, called the enhanced experimental signal (EES), for each cell to annotate regions of the cellular manifold that are enriched in the ob/ob or wild-type genotype. Examining the distribution of EES values within islet cell types, we observed only moderate overlap in beta cell populations from ob/ob and wild-type mice ( Figure 6 B), consistent with significant changes in gene expression with obesity. Moreover, beta cells exhibited higher mean EES values, indicating enrichment in ob/ob islets with a commensurate reduction in alpha, delta, and PP cells ( Figure 6 C). Beta cells from ob/ob mice showed increased expression of genes involved in protein translation, secretion, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress ( Figure 6 D; Table S7 ). These genes encoded hormones and secretory granule proteins also upregulated in KCO mice ( Figure 6 E), confirming results from bulk tumor RNA-seq.
The top upregulated gene (by fold change) in ob/ob islets was the hormone Cck ( Figure 6 E; Table S7 ). Cck is normally synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine cells of the duodenum to induce pancreatic acinar cell zymogen release for digestion. It is dysregulated in the islets of obese mice (HFD and ob/ob ) and has been reported to promote islet cell survival in the setting of insulin resistance, toxins, or other stresses ( Lavine et al., 2015, 2010 41. Lavine, J.A. ∙ Raess, P.W. ∙ Stapleton, D.S. ... Cholecystokinin is up-regulated in obese mouse islets and expands beta-cell mass by increasing beta-cell survival Endocrinology. 2010; 151 :3577-3588 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Lavine, J.A. ∙ Kibbe, C.R. ∙ Baan, M. ... Cholecystokinin expression in the β-cell leads to increased β-cell area in aged mice and protects from streptozotocin-induced diabetes and apoptosis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 309 :E819-E828 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed islet Cck expression by IHC in ob/ob mice ( Figure S5 A). We further observed Cck expression exclusively in a subset of beta cells ( Figure 6 F), those that exhibited enhanced expression of protein synthesis and secretory granule genes compared to their Cck− counterparts ( Figure 6 G; Table S7 ). Finally, Cck expression was inversely correlated with the expression of insulin ( Ins1 and Ins2 ), Slc30a8 (a zinc transporter involved in insulin granule maturation), and the insulin response gene Insig1 ( Figure 6 H), arguing that Cck, rather than insulin, secretion may predominate in these cells.
Since exogenous administration of cerulein, a Cck analog, promotes Kras -driven pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice ( Guerra et al., 2007 21. Guerra, C. ∙ Schuhmacher, A.J. ∙ Cañamero, M. ... Chronic pancreatitis is essential for induction of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by K-Ras oncogenes in adult mice Cancer Cell. 2007; 11 :291-302 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (951) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that, in the setting of obesity, endogenous islet-derived Cck could drive PDAC development. Systemic Cck levels were not increased in obese mice ( Figure S5 B), arguing that islet Cck acts locally. Cck expression was specifically observed in islets from obese models and markedly reduced by weight loss interventions ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and S5 C–S5E), consistent with an adaptive response to obesity. We further analyzed human PDAC and observed islet expression of CCK in ∼60% of samples ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Although CCK expression did not correlate with BMI ( Figure 7 D), cancer-associated weight loss prior to diagnosis may confound this analysis. Therefore, we procured islets from human donors without known malignancy and observed a positive relationship between BMI and CCK expression ( Figure 7 E). Together, these data demonstrate that obesity is associated with islet Cck expression in both mice and humans.
To test directly whether islet Cck promotes tumor progression, we utilized MIP-Cck transgenic mice, which exhibit beta cell-specific Cck expression comparable to ob/ob mice ( Lavine et al., 2015 42. Lavine, J.A. ∙ Kibbe, C.R. ∙ Baan, M. ... Cholecystokinin expression in the β-cell leads to increased β-cell area in aged mice and protects from streptozotocin-induced diabetes and apoptosis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 309 :E819-E828 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, non-obese compound transgenic mice ( MKC : MIP-Cck; Pdx1-Cre; Kras LSL-G12D/WT ) displayed a significant increase in tumor burden compared to KC controls ( Figure 7 F), supporting the hypothesis that islet Cck overexpression can function as an independent driver of pancreatic ductal tumorigenesis. Prior work has shown that the competitive Cck receptor (Cckr) antagonist proglumide, at doses that block physiologic Cck function, impedes tumor progression in non-obese KC mice ( Smith et al., 2014 73. Smith, J.P. ∙ Cooper, T.K. ∙ McGovern, C.O. ... Cholecystokinin receptor antagonist halts progression of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions and fibrosis in mice Pancreas. 2014; 43 :1050-1059 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since obesity-augmented islet Cck expression appears to function as a local driver of early PDAC progression, we anticipated that proglumide treatment would be insufficient to impair progression in the setting of supraphysiologic local concentrations of Cck in KCO mice. Indeed, although proglumide induced the expected systemic pharmacodynamic effect of slowing weight gain, no significant impact on tumor development was observed ( Figure S3 ). Thus, these data provide evidence for the importance of aberrantly expressed pancreatic endocrine hormones beyond insulin in driving obesity-associated PDAC.
We next sought to explore the mechanisms of islet Cck induction in vivo . We hypothesized that islet stress from obesity might stimulate Cck expression to promote beta cell survival ( Lavine et al., 2015 42. Lavine, J.A. ∙ Kibbe, C.R. ∙ Baan, M. ... Cholecystokinin expression in the β-cell leads to increased β-cell area in aged mice and protects from streptozotocin-induced diabetes and apoptosis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 309 :E819-E828 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this hypothesis, islet Cck expression was blunted in dapagliflozin-treated mice in which beta cell function was preserved ( Figure S4 I). We further compared the transcriptional profiles of single Cck + and Cck − beta cells derived from ob/ob mice. Since islet expansion is a consequence of obesity ( Linnemann et al., 2014 45. Linnemann, A.K. ∙ Baan, M. ∙ Davis, D.B. Pancreatic β-cell proliferation in obesity Adv. Nutr. 2014; 5 :278-288 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) and beta cell division has been associated with polyhormone expression ( Bocian-Sobkowska et al., 1999 11. Bocian-Sobkowska, J. ∙ Zabel, M. ∙ Wozniak, W. ... Polyhormonal aspect of the endocrine cells of the human fetal pancreas Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112 :147-153 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), we suspected that beta cell proliferation could act as a stimulus for Cck expression. Indeed, we observed a relative upregulation of cell cycle genes in Cck + beta cells compared to their Cck − counterparts and an increased proportion of polyhormonal Ins2 +/ Gcg + cells expressing Cck compared to monohormonal insulin-expressing ( Ins1+/Ins2+ ) cells ( Figures S6 A–S6C). Recent work has suggested that islet resident macrophages may induce beta cell proliferation in the context of HFD-induced obesity via PDGF signaling ( Ying et al., 2019 87. Ying, W. ∙ Lee, Y.S. ∙ Dong, Y. ... Expansion of Islet-Resident Macrophages Leads to Inflammation Affecting beta Cell Proliferation and Function in Obesity Cell Metab. 2019; 29 :457-474.e455 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). To evaluate for this in ob/ob mice, we examined Ptprc + ( Cd45 +) immune cells in our islet scRNA-seq data, the majority of which expressed macrophage markers ( Cd68 and Cd74 ) ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Islet macrophages in ob/ob mice exhibited upregulation of genes associated with proliferation and downregulation of genes associated with cytokine signaling and inflammatory responses ( Figures S6 F–S6I), mirroring HFD-induced changes ( Ying et al., 2019 87. Ying, W. ∙ Lee, Y.S. ∙ Dong, Y. ... Expansion of Islet-Resident Macrophages Leads to Inflammation Affecting beta Cell Proliferation and Function in Obesity Cell Metab. 2019; 29 :457-474.e455 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). These macrophages also upregulated beta cell growth factors including Pdgfb ( Figure S6 J), implicating obesity-associated changes in islet macrophages as a potential instigator of beta cell proliferation in ob/ob mice.
To further define molecular mechanisms that contribute to islet Cck expression, we examined beta cell expression of transcription factors, given their role in regulating hormone expression during islet development. Prior work has implicated Tle3/Grg3 in the suppression of Gcg expression in beta cells as islets develop ( Metzger et al., 2014 52. Metzger, D.E. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Ziaie, A.S. ... Grg3/TLE3 and Grg1/TLE1 induce monohormonal pancreatic β-cells while repressing α-cell functions Diabetes. 2014; 63 :1804-1816 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). We similarly observed decreased expression of Tle3/Grg3 and another transcriptional co-repressor Ehf as the top significantly downregulated genes in Cck + compared to Cck − cells ( Figure S6 K; Table S7 ). Furthermore, both Tle3/Grg3 and Ehf expression inversely correlated with Cck expression in ob/ob beta cells ( Figure S6 L). Together, these data support a role for beta cell proliferation and alterations in transcription factor expression as potential drivers of islet Cck expression in response to obesity.
Finally, we evaluated how Cck functions in the local microenvironment to drive tumor development. While exogenous cerulein administration is commonly used as a model for experimental pancreatitis ( Guerra et al., 2007 21. Guerra, C. ∙ Schuhmacher, A.J. ∙ Cañamero, M. ... Chronic pancreatitis is essential for induction of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by K-Ras oncogenes in adult mice Cancer Cell. 2007; 11 :291-302 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (951) PubMed Google Scholar ), our data support a pro-tumorigenic effect of islet Cck independent of inflammation. MIP-Cck mice did not exhibit overt evidence of inflammation or fibrosis ( Figure S7 A), even up to 1 year of age ( Lavine et al., 2015 42. Lavine, J.A. ∙ Kibbe, C.R. ∙ Baan, M. ... Cholecystokinin expression in the β-cell leads to increased β-cell area in aged mice and protects from streptozotocin-induced diabetes and apoptosis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 309 :E819-E828 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, it is conceivable that local inflammation, induced by obesity, could promote islet expression of Cck. Arguing against this hypothesis, acute (cerulein- or arginine-induced) or chronic (cerulein-induced) pancreatitis did not elicit islet Cck expression in mice ( Figures S7 B and S7C). Similarly, CCK expression was not significantly observed in islets of human patients with chronic pancreatitis of varying etiologies ( Figure S7 D).
PDAC is commonly thought to arise from acinar or ductal cells ( Kopp et al., 2012; Ray et al., 2011 37. Kopp, J.L. ∙ von Figura, G. ∙ Mayes, E. ... Identification of Sox9-dependent acinar-to-ductal reprogramming as the principal mechanism for initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 22 :737-750 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (512) PubMed Google Scholar 66. Ray, K.C. ∙ Bell, K.M. ∙ Yan, J. ... Epithelial tissues have varying degrees of susceptibility to Kras(G12D)-initiated tumorigenesis in a mouse model PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e16786 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the exocrine pancreas is the target of islet Cck. Alternatively, Cck has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion from beta cells in mice ( Lo et al., 2011 47. Lo, C.M. ∙ Obici, S. ∙ Dong, H.H. ... Impaired insulin secretion and enhanced insulin sensitivity in cholecystokinin-deficient mice Diabetes. 2011; 60 :2000-2007 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ), which in turn could modulate early tumorigenesis. Contrary to this latter hypothesis, Cckr ( Cckar or Cckbr ) transcripts were detectable in <0.05% of beta cells (compared to 12% of Prss2 +/ Cela1 + acinar cells) profiled from wild-type and ob/ob mice by scRNA-seq at our depth of sequencing. Furthermore, MIP-Cck mice did not exhibit increased insulin release during fasting or following glucose stimulation ( Lavine et al., 2015 42. Lavine, J.A. ∙ Kibbe, C.R. ∙ Baan, M. ... Cholecystokinin expression in the β-cell leads to increased β-cell area in aged mice and protects from streptozotocin-induced diabetes and apoptosis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 309 :E819-E828 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ob/ob islets were impaired in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( Figures S4 B–S4D). Thus, we conclude that endocrine-derived Cck likely acts on acinar cells to drive tumorigenesis.
Evidence supports a direct effect of Cck on acinar cells in rodent models to induce zymogen secretion and proliferation ( Kanemitsu et al., 2006; Logsdon, 1986 33. Kanemitsu, D. ∙ Sakagami, J. ∙ Motoyoshi, T. ... Effects of the cholecystokinin A receptor antagonist loxiglumide on the proliferation and cell cycle time of pancreatic acinar cells in rats Pancreas. 2006; 32 :190-196 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Logsdon, C.D. Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cell growth by CCK, epidermal growth factor, and insulin in vitro Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251 :G487-G494 PubMed Google Scholar ). Although CCKR expression in human acinar cells is lower than that observed in rodents, recent studies argue for a similar direct effect of CCK on intracellular signaling and zymogen release in primary human acinar cells ( Liang et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2008 44. Liang, T. ∙ Dolai, S. ∙ Xie, L. ... Ex vivo human pancreatic slice preparations offer a valuable model for studying pancreatic exocrine biology J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :5957-5969 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Murphy, J.A. ∙ Criddle, D.N. ∙ Sherwood, M. ... Direct activation of cytosolic Ca2+ signaling and enzyme secretion by cholecystokinin in human pancreatic acinar cells Gastroenterology. 2008; 135 :632-641 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cck is thought to promote tumor formation through proliferative acinar cell regeneration and/or acinar cell reprogramming, leading to acinar- to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), a prerequisite step in acinar cell-derived PDAC development ( Kopp et al., 2012; Storz, 2017 37. Kopp, J.L. ∙ von Figura, G. ∙ Mayes, E. ... Identification of Sox9-dependent acinar-to-ductal reprogramming as the principal mechanism for initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2012; 22 :737-750 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (512) PubMed Google Scholar 75. Storz, P. Acinar cell plasticity and development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2017; 14 :296-304 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cerulein is capable of directly stimulating ADM in acinar explant cultures ( Ardito et al., 2012 1. Ardito, C.M. ∙ Grüner, B.M. ∙ Takeuchi, K.K. ... EGF receptor is required for KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis Cancer Cell. 2012; 22 :304-317 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (415) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, we observed an increase in Ki67+ acinar cells in MKC mice compared to KC controls ( Figure S7 E), consistent with enhanced islet Cck-induced acinar cell proliferation. Together, these data support a model in which obesity-induced islet Cck expression cooperates with oncogenic Kras to drive tumorigenesis via acinar cell proliferation and ductal transformation ( Figure 7 G).

Section: Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that obesity plays a causal and reversible role in early PDAC progression in mice. Molecular analyses link obesity to changes in the local microenvironment and tumorigenesis via adaptive endocrine-exocrine signaling by pro-tumorigenic hormones. Hormones have long been postulated as contributing to obesity-associated cancers, with principal mechanisms including dysregulation of (1) islet-derived insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1); (2) adipocyte secreted factors (adipokines), including leptin and adiponectin; and (3) steroid sex hormones ( Murphy et al., 2018; Ulrich et al., 2018 55. Murphy, N. ∙ Jenab, M. ∙ Gunter, M.J. Adiposity and gastrointestinal cancers: epidemiology, mechanisms and future directions Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol.

Energy balance and gastrointestinal cancer: risk, interventions, outcomes and mechanisms Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 15 :683-698 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of these mechanisms, epidemiologic studies support a role for insulin, IGF1, and adipokines in PDAC development, as elevated levels of insulin, proinsulin, and leptin and low levels of IGF binding protein-1 and adiponectin are associated with increased PDAC risk ( Babic et al., 2016; Bao et al., 2013a, 2013b; Wolpin et al., 2013, 2007 2.

Cancer Inst. 2013; 105 :1027-1035 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Though previous studies suggested that leptin can promote PDAC proliferation ( Harbuzariu et al., 2017; Mendonsa et al., 2015 22. Harbuzariu, A. ∙ Rampoldi, A. ∙ Daley-Brown, D.S. ... Leptin-Notch signaling axis is involved in pancreatic cancer progression Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :7740-7752 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Mendonsa, A.M. ∙ Chalfant, M.C. ∙ Gorden, L.D. ... Modulation of the leptin receptor mediates tumor growth and migration of pancreatic cancer cells PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0126686 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), our observation of accelerated tumorigenesis in obese mice deficient in leptin signaling ( Figures 1 , S1 A, and S1B) supports a leptin-independent mechanism for obesity in tumor progression. Furthermore, the capacity for caloric restriction to intercept progression in KCO mice ( Figures 2 E and 2F) is consistent with obesity, rather than dysregulation of leptin signaling or the associated physiologic response to starvation ( Friedman, 2019 20. Friedman, J.M. Leptin and the endocrine control of energy balance Nat Metab. 2019; 1 :754-764 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ), as a driver of PDAC development.
Apart from insulin ( Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019 81. Wang, Y. ∙ Nasiri, A.R. ∙ Damsky, W.E. ... Uncoupling Hepatic Oxidative Phosphorylation Reduces Tumor Growth in Two Murine Models of Colon Cancer Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :47-55 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar 91.

Endogenous Hyperinsulinemia Contributes to Pancreatic Cancer Development Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :403-404 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), in vivo evidence for a pro-tumorigenic role of pancreatic islet hormones is limited. Our study identifies obesity-associated aberrant islet Cck expression as a cancer driver through a local effect in the pancreas. Ultrastructural and perfusion studies endorse the existence of an islet portal system perfusing exocrine cells (the islet-acinar axis) ( Barreto et al., 2010; Williams and Goldfine, 1985 10. Barreto, S.G. ∙ Carati, C.J. ∙ Toouli, J. ... The islet-acinar axis of the pancreas: more than just insulin Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299 :G10-G22 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Williams, J.A. ∙ Goldfine, I.D. The insulin-pancreatic acinar axis Diabetes. 1985; 34 :980-986 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, capillary leak or neovascularization in the setting of islet cell expansion and local tissue injury from early developing tumors may alter blood flow and permit high concentrations of islet-derived Cck to access exocrine cells. The significance of obesity-driven islet adaptations is highlighted by the observation that Cck + beta cells show diminished expression of genes involved in insulin secretion, including insulin itself ( Figure 6 H), consistent with major alterations in the secretome. We further demonstrate that CCK is expressed in islets in human PDAC ( Figure 7 C) and that islet CCK expression correlates with BMI ( Figure 7 E), supporting the possibility that a similar phenomenon occurs in human PDAC development. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that obesity may be pro-tumorigenic through its microenvironmental rather than systemic consequences ( Olson et al., 2017 60. Olson, O.C. ∙ Quail, D.F. ∙ Joyce, J.A. Obesity and the tumor microenvironment Science. 2017; 358 :1130-1131 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although evidence supporting a role for Cck signaling in PDAC progression exists ( Nadella et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2014; Smith and Solomon, 2014 58. Nadella, S. ∙ Burks, J. ∙ Al-Sabban, A. ...

Cholecystokinin receptor antagonist halts progression of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions and fibrosis in mice Pancreas. 2014; 43 :1050-1059 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), prior studies focused on intestine-derived Cck, the physiologic source of systemic Cck. On the contrary, our work highlights a local source of Cck induced by obesity within the pancreas itself—and offers the first example of endocrine-exocrine signaling beyond insulin in PDAC development.
Our results also demonstrate that weight loss impedes the elaboration of pro-tumorigenic hormonal adaptations, including islet Cck expression, and early PDAC progression. These data are consistent with human cohort studies showing that bariatric surgery reduces cancer incidence, including pancreatic cancer ( Schauer et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018 69. Schauer, D.P. ∙ Feigelson, H.S. ∙ Koebnick, C. ... Bariatric Surgery and the Risk of Cancer in a Large Multisite Cohort Ann. Surg. 2019; 269 :95-101 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar 86.

Obesity and Pancreatic Cancer: Overview of Epidemiology and Potential Prevention by Weight Loss Pancreas. 2018; 47 :158-162 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to weight loss, we explored alternative mechanisms that may influence islet adaptation. Specifically, we identified beta cell proliferation and changes in the expression of transcription factors known to govern islet hormone expression as highly associated with islet Cck expression ( Figure S6 ). We suspect that islet glucotoxicity ( Weir, 2020 82. Weir, G.C. Glucolipotoxicity, β-Cells, and Diabetes: The Emperor Has No Clothes Diabetes. 2020; 69 :273-278 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) may induce Cck expression as an adaptive survival response, given the capacity of Cck to maintain islet cell survival in the setting of stress ( Lavine et al., 2015 42. Lavine, J.A. ∙ Kibbe, C.R. ∙ Baan, M. ... Cholecystokinin expression in the β-cell leads to increased β-cell area in aged mice and protects from streptozotocin-induced diabetes and apoptosis Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 309 :E819-E828 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, our data show that glucose lowering and the resultant preservation of beta cell function by SGLT2 inhibition are associated with reduced tumor progression and islet Cck expression ( Figures S4 F–S4I). Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms by which obesity induces these islet adaptations, including Cck elaboration, remain to be fully elucidated. Future studies toward this aim may offer additional strategies beyond weight loss for PDAC prevention.

Adult animals of both genders were used in all experiments except for islet isolation studies in which only males were used. Specific developmental age of mice used is listed in figure legends. Mice were housed in a specific-pathogen free facility, kept at room temperature with standard day-night cycles, and maintained on a mixed background unless otherwise specified. Animals were monitored at least weekly for signs of morbidity and were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation when they met euthanasia criteria. Date of euthanasia relative to birth date was used for Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.
For diet studies, Kras LA2 mice were started on high-fat (60% kcal fat, Research Diets 12492) or low-fat (10% kcal fat, Research Diets 12240J) diets at 4 weeks of age. For caloric restriction, mice were fed 1 g of normal chow per mouse per day, as previously described ( Skowronski et al., 2017 71. Skowronski, A.A. ∙ Ravussin, Y. ∙ Leibel, R.L. ... Energy homeostasis in leptin deficient Lepob/ob mice PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0189784 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). For drug studies, KCO mice were treated with pharmaceutical-grade aspirin (2 mg/mL, Spectrum Chemical), metformin (2 mg/mL, Spectrum Chemical), proglumide (0.1 mg/mL, Sigma), or dapagliflozin (0.02 mg/mL, MedChem Express) in drinking water starting at 6 weeks of age and treated for 6 weeks continuously. Water consumption was measured weekly when treated water was replaced. KCO mice drank 7.69 ± 0.58 (SD), 8.95 ± 2.24, 8.09 ± 3.21, 9.70 ± 1.49, 8.97 ± 3.98 mL drinking water daily for untreated (control), aspirin, metformin, proglumide, and dapagliflozin, respectively. Water intake was not statistically different from control for each treatment condition (two-tailed Student’s t test). Based on water consumption, average daily doses were 17.9, 16.2, 0.97, and 0.18 mg for aspirin, metformin, proglumide, and dapagliflozin, respectively, leading to an average daily dose exposure of ∼456, 436, 26 mg/kg, and 4.7 mg/kg, in-line with prior studies using these agents ( Chandel et al., 2016; Saponaro et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2014 14.

Mice were randomized following pre-stratification for gender in all treatment conditions. Weights were monitored using a standard small animal scale. Glucose was measured on a OneTouch Ultra2 glucometer on whole blood collected by tail clip. For serum studies, whole blood was collected from anesthetized mice by retro-orbital bleed or terminal cardiac puncture, allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature, and spun through a serum separator tube (Sarstedt) at 10,000 rpm for 5 min prior to storage at −80°C or analysis. Serum Cck was measured by EIA (RayBiotech, Cat# EIAM-CCK). Serum insulin (RIA, Linco Cat# RI-I3K) and C-peptide (ELISA, Alpco Diagnostics Cat# 80-CPTMS-E01) were measured by the Yale Diabetes Research Core.
Murine KPC PDAC (mPDAC) cell lines (7307 and 7310) were isolated from primary autochthonous pancreatic tumors arising in female C57/B6 KC; p53 R172H/WT mice ( Hingorani et al., 2005 24. Hingorani, S.R. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Multani, A.S. ... Trp53R172H and KrasG12D cooperate to promote chromosomal instability and widely metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in mice Cancer Cell. 2005; 7 :469-483 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1894) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tumors were enzymatically dissociated using a mix of collagenase IV, dispase, and DNase I (Worthington) at 37°C for 30 minutes with further mechanical dissociation using a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Cell suspensions were passed through a 100 μM filter, washed, and plated in complete media containing DMEM (Corning), 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were grown in standard culture conditions (37°C; 5% CO 2 ) for at least five passages to separate tumor cells from tumor-associated fibroblasts. For signaling studies, cells were grown in serum-free conditions overnight, treated with 100 ng/mL recombinant murine leptin (R&D Systems, Cat# 498-OB) in serum-free media, and lysed for protein analysis after 20 minutes (peak induction of downstream signaling). Viability was assessed 72 hours after treatment using the CellTiter Glo (CTG) assay (Promega).
To generate leptin receptor knockout clones, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence (5′- TGAAAGCCACCAGACCTCGA) targeting exon 8 of the murine leptin receptor (LepR) was ligated into the BsmBI site in lentiGuide-Puro (Addgene 52963) with compatible annealed oligos to generate lentiGuide-Puro-sgLepR . Lentivirus for lentiGuide-Puro-sgLepR and lentiCas9-blast (Addgene 52962) were produced by co-transfection of 293T cells (grown in the same culture media and conditions as mPDAC cells above) with plasmids containing the lentiviral backbone, packaging vector (psPAX2), and envelope (VSV-G) using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio). Supernatant was collected at 48 and 72 hours and applied to target cells with 8 μg/mL polybrene (EMD Millipore) for transduction. Transduced cells were treated with 10 μg/mL blasticidin S (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2 μg/mL puromycin (Life Technologies) for 7 days. Cells were then sorted into single cells by limiting dilution into 96-well plates to isolate clones. Knockout clones were confirmed by genomic DNA extraction using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Epicenter), PCR amplification of the target locus (forward primer: 5′-GGTTCTCAGTGCACGCATTT-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ACAACGATTTTCCTGGCATCT-3′) with Q5 polymerase (NEB), and Sanger sequencing of PCR products by the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale. KO1 clone harbored two frameshift mutant alleles: a 32 bp deletion and an 18 bp deletion with a 2 bp insertion (effective 16 bp deletion). KO2 clone also harbored two independent frameshift mutant alleles: a 1 bp deletion and a 13 bp deletion.
Acquisition of resected PDAC biospecimens including institutional review board approval and informed consent procedures were previously described ( Qian et al., 2018 63. Qian, Z.R. ∙ Rubinson, D.A. ∙ Nowak, J.A. ... Association of Alterations in Main Driver Genes With Outcomes of Patients With Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma JAMA Oncol. 2018; 4 :e173420 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). 108 human islets of northern European descent were isolated at the Oxford Consortium for Islet Transplantation (OXCIT, Oxford, UK) as previously described ( Cross et al., 2012 18. Cross, S.E. ∙ Hughes, S.J. ∙ Clark, A. ... Collagenase does not persist in human islets following isolation Cell Transplant. 2012; 21 :2531-2535 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). All studies were approved by the University of Oxford’s “Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee” (OxTREC Reference: 2-15), or the Oxfordshire Regional Ethics Committee B (REC reference: 09/H0605/2). All organ donors provided informed consent for use of pancreatic tissue in research. Human chronic pancreatitis (etiologies included pancreatic divisum (n = 5), Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (n = 2), idiopathic (n = 5)) specimens were obtained from 12 adults (ages 25-60, M:F 4:8) undergoing Total Pancreatectomy and Islet Auto-Transplant (TP-IAT) program at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. Pancreatic biopsies were obtained at the time of surgery and processed for routine histologic analyses. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the research protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board.
Mice were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation and tissue was dissected, fixed in 10% neutral- buffered formalin overnight, and dehydrated in 70% ethanol prior to paraffin embedding. Adjacent 5-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or picosirius red or subject to immunohistochemistry (IHC). Primary antibodies for IHC are listed in the Key Resource Table. Mach 2 HRP-labeled micro-polymers (Biocare Medical) were used for primary antibody detection using a Thermo Scientific Autostainer 360. Slides were imaged with a modified Nikon T2R inverted microscope (MVI), 4x/10x/20x/40x objectives, and a 2.8 MP CoolSNAP Dyno CCD camera (Photometrics). Monochromatic red, green, and blue images were merged using ImageJ software (NIH).
Total RNA was isolated from flash frozen adipose tissue derived from db/db mice using Trizol (Ambion) and reverse transcribed with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Murine leptin cDNA was PCR amplified with Primestar high-fidelity PCR mix (Takara) using primers (forward 5′- ATGTGCTGGAGACCCCTGT-3′, reverse 5′- TCAGCATTCAGGGCTAACATCCAACT-3′) synthesized by the Koch Institute Swanson Biotechnology Center. Amplified leptin cDNA was cloned into the XhoI and NotI sites of the AAV2 backbone vector ( pFBAAVCAGmcsBgHpa ) provided by the University of Iowa Viral Vector Core (UIVVC), which generated AAV2/1CAGmLeptin (AAV-Leptin) using a baculovirus system. eGFP, cloned into the same AAV2 plasmid vector (AAV2/1CAGeGFP, AAV-GFP), was purchased from UIVVC. AAV-induced leptin expression was verified in 293T cells by western blotting 48 hours after infection. 1x10 11 AAV viral particles were administered to mice via a single injection in the tibialis anterior muscle and circulating leptin levels were measured in the serum by ELISA (Crystal Chem Cat# 90030).
Cells were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 0.5 μM EDTA and Halt protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific), rotated at 4°C for 15-30 minutes to mix, and centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 minutes to collect whole cell lysates. Protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay (Pierce). 30 μg of total protein per sample was loaded into 4%–12% NuPAGE Tris-Bis (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 4%–20% Tris-Glycine TGX (Bio-Rad) gradient gels and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (for fluorescence detection) or PVDF (for chemiluminescent detection) membranes and blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) or 5% milk, respectively. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting are listed in the Key Resource Table. HSP90 and beta-tubulin were used as loading controls. Primary antibodies were detected with fluorescent DyLight-conjugated (Cell Signaling Technology) or HRP-conjugated (Jackson Immunoresearch) secondary antibodies for fluorescent (LI-COR Odyssey scanner) or chemiluminescent detection (Perkin Elmer ECL), respectively. Quantification of phosphorylated protein levels was performed using Image Studio Lite (LI-COR) and normalized to total protein levels analyzed on the same membrane.
Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and pancreata were rapidly dissected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80C. Prior to DNA and RNA isolation, frozen tumors were mechanically ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted from ground tumor tissue using a QIAGEN Allprep DNA/RNA mini kit per manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration was measured using Quant-iT Picogreen dsRNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA concentration, quality, and purity were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.
Exome capture on mouse tumor genomic DNA was performed by Macrogen Corp. using an Agilent SureSelectXT Mouse All Exon kit. 100-nt paired-end sequencing to a raw sequence depth of 150X per sample on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) was subsequently performed. Variant calls were made using an approach similar to the HaJaVa platform ( McFadden et al., 2016 50. McFadden, D.G. ∙ Politi, K. ∙ Bhutkar, A. ... Mutational landscape of EGFR-, MYC-, and Kras-driven genetically engineered mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E6409-E6417 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads were processed to remove adaptor sequences (using exact matches to 10-mer adaptor start sequence: AGATCGGAAG) using the FASTX-toolkit ( http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit ). Surviving reads greater than or equal to 15-nt in length were retained. Reads were aligned to the mouse mm9 genome assembly (UCSC) using BWA (v0.5.5). Duplicates were removed using Picard (v1.21) MarkDuplicates utility. Local realignment of reads around indels and base quality recalibration were performed using GATK (v1.0.5538). Variant calls were made with GATK UnifiedGenotyper using the mm9 reference sequence in regions targeted by the Agilent capture kit (version G7550_20110119_mm9 from Agilent). Calls with at least 14X read coverage and dual strand support were retained and further filtered using GATK VariantFiltration (arguments - clusterWindowSize 10 -cluster 3), GATK SelectVariants (arguments “SB < −0.1,” “QUAL >= 30.0,” “QD >= 5.0,” “HRun ≤ 5”), and Sanger Mouse Genomes Project Variant calls ( Keane et al., 2011 34.

Variants were annotated using Annovar ( Wang et al., 2010 80. Wang, K. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Hakonarson, H. ANNOVAR: functional annotation of genetic variants from high-throughput sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :e164 Crossref Scopus (9400) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2016Feb01) and mouse dbSNP build 142 (ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
cDNA libraries from tumor total RNA were prepared by the MIT BioMicro Center using the Neoprep library preparation system (Illumina) with indexed adaptor sequences and polyA selection. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq to obtain paired-end 75-nt reads. All reads that passed quality metrics were mapped to UCSC mm9 mouse genome build ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/ ) using RSEM (v1.2.12) ( http://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/ ). All RNA- seq analyses were conducted in R. High-resolution signature analyses between tumors from obese ( KCO and KCO treated with AAV-GFP) and non-obese ( KC and KPC ) models were performed using a blind source separation methodology based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA), as previously described ( Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000; Muzumdar et al., 2017 25. Hyvärinen, A. ∙ Oja, E. Independent component analysis: algorithms and applications Neural Netw. 2000; 13 :411-430 Crossref Scopus (6896) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Chen, P.Y. ∙ Dorans, K.J. ... Survival of pancreatic cancer cells lacking KRAS function Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1090 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Z-scores for each tumor for each component (signature) were calculated using ICA and reflect relative correspondence between a tumor and each signature (degree of positive or negative correlation). 3 derived signatures (Sig6, Sig12, and Sig13) showed statistically significant differences in Z-scores comparing KCO and KC/KPC tumors (p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney test) and were used in subsequent analyses.
Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/ ) were carried out using standardized signature correlation scores (for ICA signatures) with default settings. Normalized enrichment score (NES), false discovery rate (FDR), ICA signature (Sig6, Sig12, or Sig13 separating KCO and KC / KPC tumors), and MSigDB gene set rank are shown in relevant figures. Network representations of GSEA results were generated using EnrichmentMap ( http://www.baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap ) for Cytoscape v3.3.0 ( https://cytoscape.org/ ) with p < 0.005 and FDR < 0.1. Each circle represents a gene set with circle size corresponding to gene set size and intensity corresponding to enrichment significance. Red is upregulated and blue is downregulated. Each line corresponds to minimum 50% mutual overlap with line thickness corresponding to degree of overlap. Cellular processes for gene set clusters were manually curated.
Genes with standardized signature correlation scores z > 3 (or z < −3) in Sig6, Sig12, and Sig13 were used as gene sets to stratify TCGA ( https://www.cancer.gov/tcga/ ) Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD) tumors ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 13. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ) using ssGSEA ( Barbie et al., 2009 7. Barbie, D.A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Boehm, J.S. ... Systematic RNA interference reveals that oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers require TBK1 Nature. 2009; 462 :108-112 Crossref Scopus (2338) PubMed Google Scholar ). Associated patients within top and bottom buckets (> or < 1 SD) were each assessed for over-representation of previously established molecular subtypes (squamous (n = 31), immunogenic (n = 28), progenitor (n = 53), ADEX (n = 38) ( Bailey et al., 2016 3. Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Crossref Scopus (2382) PubMed Google Scholar )) using the hypergeometric test. The human tumor subtype classifications used are based on those reported by TCGA ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 13. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1179) PubMed Google Scholar ) prior to tumor cellularity correction.
Tumor suppressor gene mutations in RNA-seq datasets were called using the GATK Best Practices workflow for SNP calling on RNA-seq data ( https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article.php?id=3891 ). Transcriptomic reads were trimmed to eliminate adaptor sequences using an exact 10-mer match to the start of the adaptor sequence (AGATCGGAAG) using Cutadapt (v1.16) and subsequently mapped to the mouse mm9 (UCSC) genome assembly using the STAR RNA-seq aligner with default parameters. Picard v2.17.0 MarkDuplicates utility was used to mark duplicates in the aligned data. GATK (v3.8.0) toolkit was used to “SplitNTrim” and reassign mapping qualities as per GATK best practices. Indel realignment and base recalibration were performed as recommended. Variants were called against the mm9 reference sequence using the GATK HaplotypeCaller and filtered using GATK VariantFiltration with recommended parameters. Variant calls were annotated using Annovar (version 2016Feb01).
Targeted exome sequencing and IHC of human PDAC biospecimens has been previously described ( Qian et al., 2018 63. Qian, Z.R. ∙ Rubinson, D.A. ∙ Nowak, J.A. ... Association of Alterations in Main Driver Genes With Outcomes of Patients With Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma JAMA Oncol. 2018; 4 :e173420 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pre-operative body-mass index (BMI) and molecular data on the main PDAC driver genes was available for 184 of 356 patients from this prior study. Of note, PDAC patients experience significant weight loss in the months preceding diagnosis, and weight at surgery may therefore not be fully reflective of weight in the prediagnostic period. In 125 patients with available weight data at 6 months before diagnosis, we compared weight at surgery with weight 6 months before diagnosis and observed a strong correlation (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.90, p < 0.0001). This suggests that although weight may decrease in months preceding diagnosis, the rank order of 2 measurements is likely to be highly consistent. We used World Health Organization categories to classify patients as normal weight (< 25 kg/m 2 ), overweight (25-30 kg/m 2 ), or obese (> 30 kg/m 2 ). Using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Version 9.4), we performed logistic regression adjusted for age at surgery (continuous), gender (men, women), study site, grade (well/moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated/undifferentiated, unknown), perineural invasion (no, yes, unknown), lymphovascular invasion (no, yes, unknown), N stage (N0, N1, unknown), T stage (T1/T2, T3/T4, unknown), and tumor location (head/uncinate, body, tail, unknown), to evaluate the association between BMI (normal, overweight, obese) and driver alterations in human PDAC. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Kruskal- Wallis test to compare the number of driver alterations across BMI categories.
Islets from C57/B6 wild-type and ob/ob male mice (n = 4 mice/group) were isolated and perifused for glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) studies as previously described ( Jesinkey et al., 2019 29. Jesinkey, S.R. ∙ Madiraju, A.K. ∙ Alves, T.C. ... Mitochondrial GTP Links Nutrient Sensing to beta Cell Health, Mitochondrial Morphology, and Insulin Secretion Independent of OxPhos Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :759-772.e710 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a few minor changes, which are noted. Isolated islets were recovered overnight and were perfused the following day in DMEM (D5030, Sigma) supplemented with 24 mM NaHCO 3 , 10 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine, and 0.2% BSA. The islets first equilibrated for 1 hour at 2.5 mM glucose on the perifusion instrument. After the stabilization period, islets were perfused with basal (2.5 mM) glucose for 10 minutes followed by stimulatory glucose (16.7 mM) for 45 minutes. After stimulation with glucose, the islets were exposed to basal glucose for 15 minutes followed by a final 30 mM KCl step to ensure that the insulin secreting machinery distal to mitochondrial metabolism was intact in the two groups tested. During the perifusion, eluent was collected into a 96-well plate format and both secreted and total islet insulin concentrations were determined by a Mouse High Range Insulin ELISA assay kit (Alpco Diagnostics) and normalized to islet DNA using Picogreen.
Murine pancreatic islets used for single-cell analysis were isolated as described for GSIS studies, except samples were dispersed into single cells immediately after isolation using accutase (GIBCO) and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. Dead cells were removed using a MACS Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and cell concentration determined using a Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Scientific). Single-cell library preparation was performed using a Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v3 (10X Genomics) and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq. Gene counts matrices were generated using CellRanger. Genes detected in fewer than 15 cells were removed and cells with library sizes greater than 15,000 UMI/cell were removed as potential doublets. We observed a bimodal distribution of mitochondrial gene detection and removed cells in the top 12.5% of library-size normalized mitochondrial expression as apoptotic cells. We then focused our analysis on single hormone-expressing islet cells as measured by the expression of Ins1/Ins2 , Gcg , Sst , and Ppy , removing dual hormone-expressing cells and cells expressing markers of acinar, ductal, endothelial, or immune cells.
Cells were visualized using PHATE ( Moon et al., 2019 53. Moon, K.R. ∙ van Dijk, D. ∙ Wang, Z. ... Visualizing structure and transitions in high-dimensional biological data Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :1482-1492 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters and gene expression was denoised using MAGIC ( van Dijk et al., 2018 79. van Dijk, D. ∙ Sharma, R. ∙ Nainys, J. ... Recovering Gene Interactions from Single-Cell Data Using Data Diffusion Cell. 2018; 174 :716-729.e727 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (850) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. The Enhanced Experimental Signal (EES) was calculated using MELD ( Burkhardt et al., 2019 12. Burkhardt, D.B. ∙ Stanley, J.S. ∙ Perdigoto, A.L. ... Quantifying the effect of experimental perturbations in single-cell RNA-sequencing data using graph signal processing bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) with default parameters. Overlap of upregulated/downregulated genes comparing ob/ob versus wild-type (WT) (q < 0.0001, log2FC > 0.5, mean normalized expression counts > 0.5) or Cck+ (expression > 0) versus Cck- (q < 0.0001, mean normalized expression counts > Cck ) beta cells with gene ontology (C5 biological process and cellular components) and hallmark (H) gene sets in MSigDB ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/ ) were computed using the hypergeometric test. Statistical testing for differential expression was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test as implemented in diffxpy.
IHC for detection of CCK expression in human PDAC samples was performed on 4-μm sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks containing neoplastic and non-neoplastic pancreatic parenchyma that were obtained as part of specimens resected for PDAC treatment, as previously described ( Qian et al., 2018 63. Qian, Z.R. ∙ Rubinson, D.A. ∙ Nowak, J.A. ... Association of Alterations in Main Driver Genes With Outcomes of Patients With Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma JAMA Oncol. 2018; 4 :e173420 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (pH 6.0, Dako) in a 2100 Antigen Retriever system (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sections were then incubated with dual endogenous peroxidase block (Dako) for 20 minutes at room temperature, protein block (Dako) for 10 minutes at room temperature, and anti-CCK8 primary antibody for 1 hour at 4°C. Chromogenic visualization was subsequently performed using the EnVision+ System- HRP (Dako) with a 3 minute diaminobenzidine (DAB) incubation followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. For evaluation of CCK expression, the surrounding exocrine pancreas served as an internal negative control. If present within the section, neuroendocrine cells within the epithelium of the duodenum served as internal positive controls. The immunohistochemical assessment of CCK expression was conducted without knowledge of BMI or other patient data.
For human donor islets, RNA was extracted, sequenced, and analyzed as previously described ( van de Bunt et al., 2015 78. van de Bunt, M. ∙ Manning Fox, J.E. ∙ Dai, X. ... Transcript Expression Data from Human Islets Links Regulatory Signals from Genome-Wide Association Studies for Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemic Traits to Their Downstream Effectors PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1005694 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads per kilobase of CCK transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) was log2 normalized for analysis. For a subset of donors, BMI was not available, and samples could not be used in analysis. Given limited sample size, low and high BMI groups were specified based on the median United States BMI (28.2 kg/m 2 ) defined by the most recent 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ( https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm ). This also closely approximated median BMI in the donor cohort of 28 kg/m 2 .
Acute pancreatitis was induced in adult C57/B6 mice (∼25 g in weight) using cerulein (Sigma; six hourly 50 μg/kg intraperitoneally (IP) injections) or arginine (Sigma; three hourly 3 g/kg IP injections). Mice were euthanized and processed for histology at 12 and/or 48 hours after the first injection. Chronic pancreatitis was induced in adult C57/B6 mice with cerulein given six hourly 50 μg/kg IP injections three times a week for 2 weeks prior to analysis. Acute or chronic PBS-treated mice were used as controls. Two mice from each treatment group were analyzed.
Percentage of tumor burden was quantified blinded to group on scanned slides (Aperio) by measuring cross-sectional tumor area (PanIN or PDAC including stroma) relative to total pancreas area using ImageJ or QuPath v0.1.2 software. Details of statistical tests used for each experiment including n, definition of center, and precision measures are described in the figure legends. All error bars denote standard error of mean (SEM) unless otherwise denoted. A p-value of < 0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. In general, p values for comparisons of two groups were determined by two-tailed Student’s t test (for normally distributed data) or Mann-Whitney U test (for non-parametric data), as noted in the figure legends, using Prism (Graphpad). The log-rank test was used for Kaplan-Meier survival analyses using Prism. All replicates were included in these analyses and represent measurements from distinct samples (biologic replicates) unless otherwise noted in the figure legends.
The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available in the NCBI Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNA544740 and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession numbers GSE131714 and GSE137236 .

Download all Spreadsheet (715.45 KB) Table S1. Tumor Suppressor Gene Single Nucleotide Variants in KCO Tumors, Related to Figure 3 Mutant allele fractions for each coding nucleotide (compared to mm9 reference database) of tumor suppressor genes ( Trp53 , CDKN2A/p16 , and SMAD4 ) derived from whole exome sequencing and RNA-seq are shown for individual KCO tumors and averaged across all tumors Average base coverage across KCO tumors is as follows: Trp53 (84X exome, 127X RNA), CDKN2A/p16 (40X exome, 89X RNA), and SMAD4 (103X exome, 86X RNA). Blank cells denote lack of base coverage in sequencing, which was rare and sporadic. A single KPC tumor (7075) was used as a positive control for single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection (resulting in a R172H codon substitution as noted). No tumor suppressor gene SNVs were detected in KCO tumors. Spreadsheet (194.13 KB) Tables S2. Single Nucleotide Variants in Murine Tumors, Related to Figure 3 All single nucleotide variants (SNV) called in KCO (n = 13) and KPC (n = 1) tumors by whole exome sequencing are listed by tumor. Variant information includes location (chromosome, cytoband, and position in mm9 genome), genic location (exonic, intergenic, UTR), nucleotide change (var versus ref), read counts for variant (tumor_reads2) and reference (tumor_reads1), and variant frequency (tumor_var_freq). Exon SNVs were further classified as synonymous or non-synonymous with reference to transcript (RefSeq), exon number (Exon_num), and coding sequence position (AA_change). Spreadsheet (54.72 KB) Table S3. Compilation of Non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Variants in Murine Tumors, Related to Figure 3 Compiled non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified on whole exome sequencing data derived from all sequenced KCO and KPC tumors from Table S2. A total of 531 non-synonymous SNVs were called from 14 tumors (∼37.7 SNVs per KCO mouse (n = 13) and 41 non-synonymous SNVs in KPC mouse (n = 1)). Induced Kras , Lep ( ob ), and Trp53 mutations were observed as expected. Of consensus pan-cancer genetic drivers (Bailey et al., 2018), Arid5b, Cacna1a, Eef2 , and Kit harbored recurrent non-synonymous SNVs. These SNVs were not observed in human cancer (COSMIC) to suggest pathogenicity. PDF (92.03 KB) Document S1. Tables S4 and S5, Related to Figure 3 Table S5. Number (percentage) of tumors that are either wild-type (WT) or mutant (MUT; mutation by exome sequencing or loss by IHC) for each driver gene stratified by patient BMI. Odds ratios (OR) from logistic regression models were adjusted for age at surgery (continuous), study site, gender (men, women), grade (well/moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated/undifferentiated, unknown), perineural invasion (no, yes, unknown), lymphovascular invasion (no, yes, unknown), N stage (N0, N1, unknown), T stage (T1/T2, T3/T4, unknown), and tumor location (head/uncinate, body, tail, unknown). For cumulative analysis of PDAC drivers, total number of patients (N) and mean (standard deviation) number of driver alterations per tumor were stratified by patient BMI. p value is based on the Kruskal- Wallis test. Spreadsheet (9.11 MB) Table S6. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) of Mouse Tumor RNA-Seq, Related to Figures 4 and 5 Log (base 2) transformed normalized expression counts per gene in individual KCO , KC , and KPC tumors used in RNA-seq analyses. Mouse number, genotype, and AAV treatments are shown. Gene signatures (Sig6, Sig12, and Sig13) that distinguish obese ( KCO ) and non-obese ( KC and KPC ) tumors by ICA (See STAR Methods) are shown. Per-gene expression correlation Z-scores with respect to the signature are listed (positive is correlated with KCO tumors) for each gene signature and ordered by log (base 2) fold change comparing the above groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results correlated with KCO tumors (UP) are shown comparing ICA-derived signatures (6, 12, and 13) with curated (C2) and hallmark (H) gene sets in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).
