Title: Macrophages Maintain Epithelium Integrity by Limiting Fungal Product Absorption


Abstract: Summary

The colon is primarily responsible for absorbing fluids. It contains a large number of microorganisms including fungi, which are enriched in its distal segment. The colonic mucosa must therefore tightly regulate fluid influx to control absorption of fungal metabolites, which can be toxic to epithelial cells and lead to barrier dysfunction. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism by which the innate immune system allows rapid quality check of absorbed fluids to avoid intoxication of colonocytes. This mechanism relies on a population of distal colon macrophages that are equipped with “balloon-like” protrusions (BLPs) inserted in the epithelium, which sample absorbed fluids. In the absence of macrophages or BLPs, epithelial cells keep absorbing fluids containing fungal products, leading to their death and subsequent loss of epithelial barrier integrity. These results reveal an unexpected and essential role of macrophages in the maintenance of colon-microbiota interactions in homeostasis.

Section: Introduction

The intestinal tract provides a unique environment because it is continuously exposed to food antigens as well as to the commensal microbiota. It comprises different regions with distinct anatomies and physiological roles. Maintenance of the intestinal barrier is critical given that it controls the absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water from the gut lumen into the blood circulation and further prevents the absorption of toxic luminal substances ( Al-Bahrani et al., 2010 1. Al-Bahrani, A.Z. ∙ Darwish, A. ∙ Hamza, N. ... Gut barrier dysfunction in critically ill surgical patients with abdominal compartment syndrome Pancreas. 2010; 39 :1064-1069 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, disruption of the intestinal barrier leads to multiple pathological situations ranging from nutrient deprivation ( Fishman et al., 2014 25. Fishman, J.E. ∙ Levy, G. ∙ Alli, V. ... The intestinal mucus layer is a critical component of the gut barrier that is damaged during acute pancreatitis Shock. 2014; 42 :264-270 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inflammatory bowel diseases ( Anbazhagan et al., 2018 2.

Among the different regions of the intestine, the distal colon is particularly important for fluid absorption. On the one hand, the distal colon epithelium is exposed to the elevated osmotic pressure needed to induce water absorption by epithelial cells to dehydrate and solidify feces ( Naftalin, 1994 63. Naftalin, R.J. The dehydrating function of the descending colon in relationship to crypt function Physiol. Res. 1994; 43 :65-73 PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, the distal colon faces a tremendous amount of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses ( Donaldson et al., 2016 19. Donaldson, G.P. ∙ Lee, S.M. ∙ Mazmanian, S.K. Gut biogeography of the bacterial microbiota Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :20-32 Crossref Scopus (1622) PubMed Google Scholar ; Flynn et al., 2018 26.

Scupham, A.J. ∙ Presley, L.L. ∙ Wei, B. ... Abundant and diverse fungal microbiota in the murine intestine Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72 :793-801 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, fungi are more abundant in the distal colon and can produce metabolites that trigger apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells ( Upperman et al., 2003 91. Upperman, J.S. ∙ Potoka, D.A. ∙ Zhang, X.R. ... Mechanism of intestinal-derived fungal sepsis by gliotoxin, a fungal metabolite J. Pediatr. Surg. 2003; 38 :966-970 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). The colonic mucosa must therefore tightly regulate fluid absorption to avoid potential entry of toxic fungal metabolites into epithelial cells and further into the blood circulation. The mechanisms underlying such regulation remain unknown.
Fluid absorption in the distal colon is achieved by a single-layered epithelium displaying a selective permeability. Permeability is controlled by the presence of (1) an abundant mucus, which consists of net-like polymers ( Matsuo et al., 1997 52. Matsuo, K. ∙ Ota, H. ∙ Akamatsu, T. ... Histochemistry of the surface mucous gel layer of the human colon Gut. 1997; 40 :782-789 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ) and acts as a physical mesh separating the colon luminal content from the epithelium ( Kamphuis et al., 2017 39. Kamphuis, J.B.J. ∙ Mercier-Bonin, M. ∙ Eutamène, H. ... Mucus organisation is shaped by colonic content; a new view Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8527 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), and (2) junctional complexes, which seal the space between epithelial cells ( Ballard et al., 1995 5. Ballard, S.T. ∙ Hunter, J.H. ∙ Taylor, A.E. Regulation of tight-junction permeability during nutrient absorption across the intestinal epithelium Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15 :35-55 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fluid absorption through epithelial cells is tightly coordinated by sodium pumps, ionic channels, transporters (e.g., ENac, Na/K-ATPase), and Aquaporins ( Masyuk et al., 2002 51. Masyuk, A.I. ∙ Marinelli, R.A. ∙ LaRusso, N.F. Water transport by epithelia of the digestive tract Gastroenterology. 2002; 122 :545-562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Altogether, these components control the selective absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water. This process, referred to as intestinal permeability, continuously adapts to fluctuations in the availability of nutrients and electrolytes and to the body salt/water balance ( Martínez et al., 2012 49.

De Santis, S. ∙ Cavalcanti, E. ∙ Mastronardi, M. ... Nutritional keys for intestinal barrier modulation Front. Immunol. 2015; 6 :612 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intestinal permeability is also regulated by the microbiota ( Yu, 2018 98. Yu, L.C.-H.

T cell activation causes diarrhea by increasing intestinal permeability and inhibiting epithelial Na+/K+-ATPase J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110 :1739-1747 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). How the dialog between intestinal epithelial cells, microbes, and immune cells is orchestrated to maintain intestinal permeability in homeostasis remains unclear.
In homeostatic conditions, one of the most abundant types of intestinal immune cells are macrophages (Mɸs), which mainly differentiate from monocytes in response to local cues. Intestinal Mɸs reside either within the lamina propria or the muscle layer, where they participate in a variety of biological processes, including the degradation of microorganisms ( Smith et al., 2011 83.

Oral tolerance can be established via gap junction transfer of fed antigens from CX3CR1 + macrophages to CD103 + dendritic cells Immunity. 2014; 40 :248-261 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). The function of Mɸs is tightly regulated by the microbiota ( Schulthess et al., 2019 76. Schulthess, J. ∙ Pandey, S. ∙ Capitani, M. ... The Short Chain Fatty Acid Butyrate Imprints an Antimicrobial Program in Macrophages Immunity. 2019; 50 :432-445.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (626) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, accordingly, they are more abundant in the colon than in the small intestine ( Denning et al., 2011 17.

Lamina propria macrophages in the human gastrointestinal mucosa: their distribution, immunohistological phenotype, and function J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44 :721-731 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, in the colon, Mɸs can be found in close association with epithelial cells ( Kang et al., 2020 40. Kang, B. ∙ Alvarado, L.J. ∙ Kim, T. ... Commensal microbiota drive the functional diversification of colon macrophages Mucosal Immunol. 2020; 13 :216-229 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nagashima et al., 1996 64. Nagashima, R. ∙ Maeda, K. ∙ Imai, Y. ... Lamina propria macrophages in the human gastrointestinal mucosa: their distribution, immunohistological phenotype, and function J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44 :721-731 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Disruption of Mɸs’ sub-epithelial localization participates in the loss of intestinal barrier integrity observed in inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease ( Nalle and Turner, 2015 65. Nalle, S.C. ∙ Turner, J.R. Intestinal barrier loss as a critical pathogenic link between inflammatory bowel disease and graft-versus-host disease Mucosal Immunol. 2015; 8 :720-730 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mɸs are, therefore, ideally positioned to orchestrate epithelial cell-microbiota interactions for maintenance of colon homeostasis.
Here, we investigated the role of Mɸs in the integrity and function of the colon epithelium in homeostasis. We show that sub-epithelial Mɸs perform a rapid quality check of the fluids absorbed through distal colon epithelial cells, protecting them from being poisoned by luminal fungal metabolites.

Section: Results

The gut immune system is highly compartmentalized, with different cell types distributed in gradients along the intestine ( Mowat and Agace, 2014 58. Mowat, A.M. ∙ Agace, W.W. Regional specialization within the intestinal immune system Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :667-685 Crossref Scopus (1098) PubMed Google Scholar ). This particularly concerns Mɸs, which are present in greater amounts in the colon as compared to the small intestine. Colonic Mɸs display an anergic phenotype ( Bain et al., 2013 4. Bain, C.C. ∙ Scott, C.L. ∙ Uronen-Hansson, H. ...

Smythies, L.E. ∙ Sellers, M. ∙ Clements, R.H. ... Human intestinal macrophages display profound inflammatory anergy despite avid phagocytic and bacteriocidal activity J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115 :66-75 Crossref Scopus (761) PubMed Google Scholar ) and their loss correlates with the development of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease ( Rubio et al., 2018 71. Rubio, C.A. ∙ Langner, C. ∙ Schmidt, P.T. Partial to complete abrogation of the subepithelial macrophage barrier against the gut microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s colitis Histopathology. 2018; 72 :580-587 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a contribution to the maintenance of epithelium integrity. However, the mechanism(s) by which Mɸs achieve such a homeostatic function in vivo remains unknown. To address this question, we depleted Mɸs using the CD64 DTR mouse model ( Baranska et al., 2018 6. Baranska, A. ∙ Shawket, A. ∙ Jouve, M. ... Unveiling skin macrophage dynamics explains both tattoo persistence and strenuous removal J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :1115-1133 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) and evaluated the state of the epithelium ( Figure 1 A). We analyzed both proximal and distal colons as they are known to exhibit differences both in physiology ( Dolman and Edmonds, 1975 18. Dolman, D. ∙ Edmonds, C.J.

Macromolecular transport across the rabbit proximal and distal colon Gut. 1999; 44 :218-225 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) and microbiota composition ( Flynn et al., 2018 26. Flynn, K.J. ∙ Ruffin, 4th, M.T. ∙ Turgeon, D.K. ... Spatial variation of the native colon microbiota in healthy adults Cancer Prev. Res. (Phila.). 2018; 11 :393-402 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Leonardi et al., 2018 44. Leonardi, I. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Semon, A. ... CX3CR1 + mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). The efficient depletion of colonic Mɸs was verified by flow cytometry and immunostaining in both colon segments ( Figure S1 A). Unexpectedly, we found that Mɸ depletion led to massive apoptosis of epithelial cells in the distal but not the proximal colon ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Death of epithelial cells in the distal colon was also observed when Mɸs were depleted by injecting anti-CSF1 receptor antibodies in C57BL/6J mice ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Of note, if the presence of apoptotic cells merely resulted from the lack of scavenging by Mɸs, equal numbers of dead cells should be detected in distal and proximal colons ( Figure 1 C). Our results, therefore, suggest that Mɸs facilitate the survival of epithelial cells in the distal colon specifically.
To evaluate the impact of epithelial cell death on epithelium permeability, we infused CD64 WT and CD64 DTR mice intra-rectally with a hypotonic solution containing the small fluorescent molecule hydrazide and measured its appearance in the blood. We found that hydrazide was more abundant in the blood of Mɸ-depleted mice compared to control animals ( Figure 1 D), indicative of an increase in barrier permeability in these animals. Altogether, these results show that Mɸs are needed for epithelial cell survival and intestinal barrier integrity in the distal colon.
These results prompted us to investigate distribution of Mɸs and their physical interaction with epithelial cells in the proximal and distal colon. To address this question, we performed whole-mount immunostaining of proximal and distal colon sections isolated from CD11c-Cre/R26 mTmG mice ( Caton et al., 2007 11. Caton, M.L. ∙ Smith-Raska, M.R. ∙ Reizis, B. Notch-RBP-J signaling controls the homeostasis of CD8- dendritic cells in the spleen J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204 :1653-1664 Crossref Scopus (676) PubMed Google Scholar ; Muzumdar et al., 2007 62. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Tasic, B. ∙ Miyamichi, K. ... A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse Genesis. 2007; 45 :593-605 Crossref Scopus (2578) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this mouse model, all cells that express CD11c throughout their differentiation, which include intestinal Mɸs (and dendritic cells, DCs), switch from membrane-tomato to membrane-GFP expression, allowing better visualization of these phagocytes in the tissue.
Using these animals, we observed a phagocyte population in the distal colon that physically interacted with epithelial cells through membrane protrusions shaped as balloons ( Figures 1 E and 1F), which we will refer to as “balloon-like” protrusions (BLPs) hereafter. The cell bodies of these cells were localized around the opening of the crypts ( Video S1 ). On average, each cell displayed three BLPs that crossed the basement membrane and contacted the base of epithelial cells. Of note, BLPs do not correspond to the “transepithelial dendrites” previously described in the small intestine ( Rescigno et al., 2001 68. Rescigno, M. ∙ Urbano, M. ∙ Valzasina, B. ... Dendritic cells express tight junction proteins and penetrate gut epithelial monolayers to sample bacteria Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2 :361-367 Crossref Scopus (2135) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vallon-Eberhard et al., 2006 92. Vallon-Eberhard, A. ∙ Landsman, L. ∙ Yogev, N. ... Transepithelial pathogen uptake into the small intestinal lamina propria J. Immunol. 2006; 176 :2465-2469 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ) as they do not reach the lumen of the colon. Immunostaining showed that BLP + cells resembled bona fide intestinal Mɸs (CD11b + MHCII + F4/80 + CX3CR1 + CD64 + CD103 − CX3CR1-GFP + ; Figure S2 ) and accordingly, they were lost in toxin-injected CD64 DTR mice ( Figure S1 A) ( Mowat and Bain, 2011 59. Mowat, A.M. ∙ Bain, C.C. Mucosal macrophages in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation J. Innate Immun. 2011; 3 :550-564 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, reduced numbers of BLPs were observed in the proximal colon ( Figures 1 E and 1G), even though proximal crypts contained a similar number of Mɸs as their distal counterpart ( Figure 1 H). Observation of proximal colon Mɸs at higher resolution showed that they also displayed protrusions, which, however, were rather thin and without balloons ( Figures 1 F and 1I). We conclude that the distal colon is enriched with Mɸs equipped with peculiar balloon-like membrane protrusions inserted at the base of epithelial cells.

Scale bar – 50 μm in the beginning of the movie, arrows indicate opening of the crypts (00:18, mm:ss), body of the single Mф and BLPs (00:34, mm:ss).
We next analyzed the inner structure of BLPs using high-resolution confocal microscopy. We found that BLPs were approximately 1–5 μm in diameter, some of them forming thin extensions (about 0.3 μm in diameter and 5–10 μm in length; Video S2 ) that extended between epithelial cells ( Figure 2 A, left). BLPs were filled with membranes and vesicles devoid of actin ( Figure 2 A, right). Most BLP internal vesicles in CD11c-Cre/R26 mTmG mice were Tomato + , indicating that they originated from cells that do not express CD11c ( Figure 2 B, upper panel). Given the intra-epithelial localization of BLPs, we hypothesized that these membranes might come from epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we generated Villin: Cre-ER T2 /R26 mTmG mice ( el Marjou et al., 2004 21. el Marjou, F. ∙ Janssen, K.P. ∙ Chang, B.H.J. ...

Analysis of distal colon sections from these animals showed that BLPs were filled with GFP-positive membranes ( Figure 2 B, lower panel), showing that they contain membranes and vesicles of epithelial origin.

Correlative light-transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that BLP inner vesicles varied from 10 to 200 nm in diameter and were partly filled with electron-dense material, suggesting that they might contain lysosomes ( Figure 2 C). Accordingly, most BLPs were positive for the LAMP1, LAMP2, and Rab7A late-endosomal/lysosomal markers (LAMP1-positive, 73.3% ± 3.5%; LAMP2-positive, 62% ± 2.5%; Rab7A-positive, 63.6% ± 3%) ( Figure 2 D). In contrast, the marker of early endosomes, EEA1, was barely detected in BLPs (EEA1-positive, 8.8% ± 3.6%, Figure 2 D). Consistent with their late-endosomal/lysosomal origin, all BLPs were also enriched in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and associated invariant chain, CD74 or Ii (100%; Figure 2 E). Of note, as we did not observe these two molecules in the epithelium, this result suggests that the endolysosomal markers found within BLPs were most likely expressed in the Mɸs themselves rather than internalized from neighboring cells. These data show that BLPs are filled with endolysosomal compartments that contain membranes internalized from epithelial cells.
We next asked whether BLP + Mɸs constitute a unique cell population, distinct from its BLP − counterpart. To address this question, we FACS-sorted terminally differentiated Mɸs from both proximal (majority of Mɸs are BLP − ) and distal colons (majority of Mɸs are BLP + ) of a C57BL/6J mouse and compared their gene expression profiles using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) ( Zheng et al., 2017 99. Zheng, G.X.Y. ∙ Terry, J.M. ∙ Belgrader, P. ... Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14049 Crossref Scopus (3495) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A; Figure S3 ). To reliably identify transcriptionally different Mɸ subpopulations, we adopted a semi-supervised approach to group the cells based on their gene expression profile. First, we explored different solutions obtained by varying the input with a graph-based clustering algorithm ( Satija et al., 2015 72. Satija, R. ∙ Farrell, J.A. ∙ Gennert, D. ... Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :495-502 Crossref Scopus (3228) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify the cluster whose relative abundance was greater in the distal than in the proximal colon, as observed for BLP + Mɸs. Based on the percentages of BLP + Mɸs quantified from colon sections ( Figure 3 B), we selected feasible solutions as the ones where the fraction of putative BLP + Mɸs was between 50% and 70% in the distal colon and below 40% in the proximal colon. Second, we scored the solutions using the silhouette width, a measure of the similarity of each cell to the cells of the same cluster compared to the cells belonging to the neighboring cluster. The optimal solution was then defined as a feasible one whose average silhouette width of all cells ( silh(C) ) and of putative BLP + Mɸ ( silh(BLP + Mɸ) ) was maximal.
The optimal solution identified with this approach contained five clusters ( Figures S4 A and S4B; Table S1 ). Only two of them, clusters 0 and 1, expressed high levels of all Mɸ markers (CD45, CD11b, F4/80, CD64, MHCII), hence the other three, comprising 140 cells overall, likely contained contaminants (e.g., epithelial cells and fibroblasts, Figure S4 C) and were therefore removed. In total, we collected 2,106 МΦs: 1,354 cells in cluster 0 and 1,752 cells in cluster 1 ( Figure 3 B). Whereas the distal colon sample included 58% of cells from cluster 1, the proximal colon only included 18%. This result suggested that cluster 1 is enriched for BLP + Mɸs, whereas cluster 0 is enriched for BLP − МΦs. To test this hypothesis, we stained tissue sections with anti-CD11c ( Itgax ) antibodies, as the CD11c gene was found to be more expressed in cluster 1 as compared to cluster 0 ( Figure 3 B). Strikingly, we observed that these antibodies specifically labeled sub-epithelial BLPs + Mɸs in the distal colon ( Figure 3 C). Importantly, the percentage of BLP + Mɸs found by tissue staining ( Figure 3 B) was similar to the percentage of CD11c high Mɸs defined by flow cytometry and imaging in the distal colon ( Figure 3 D), suggesting that tissue disaggregation leads to the limited death of BLP + Mɸs. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that cluster 1 is enriched for BLP + Mɸs.
To identify the genes specific for BLP + Mɸs, we then extracted the genes that are differentially expressed in clusters 0 and 1. We found that 88 and 122 genes were respectively up- and downregulated in BLP + Mɸs as compared to BLP − Mɸs ( Figure 3 E; Table S2 ). Among them, several genes could be directly or indirectly linked with microbiota recognition and inflammatory disorders in the colon, such as lgal3 ( Esteban et al., 2011 23.

We next compared our results to a recently published study ( Kang et al., 2020 40. Kang, B. ∙ Alvarado, L.J. ∙ Kim, T. ... Commensal microbiota drive the functional diversification of colon macrophages Mucosal Immunol. 2020; 13 :216-229 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ) in which single-cell RNA-seq was used to identify the presence of distinct Mɸ subpopulations in the murine colon. This comparison showed that one of these subpopulations, cluster 4, which corresponded to terminally differentiated Mɸs ( Figure S4 D), shared 60 genes with the signature of our BLP + Mɸ, including CD11c ( Figure 3 F). In contrast, the cluster described in that study as cluster 6 strongly resembled our BLP − Mɸs, with 59 overlapping genes. Consistent with our results, these two subpopulations were found to be spatially segregated within the colonic stroma; cluster 4 was localized closer to the epithelium, whereas cluster 6 was closer to the muscle layer. Interestingly, both clusters 4 and 6 were decreased in germ-free mice ( Kang et al., 2020 40. Kang, B. ∙ Alvarado, L.J. ∙ Kim, T. ... Commensal microbiota drive the functional diversification of colon macrophages Mucosal Immunol. 2020; 13 :216-229 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results suggest that BLP + colonic Mɸs correspond to a specific Mɸ subpopulation that is enriched in the distal colon, forms tight interactions with epithelial cells, and might be influenced by the microbiota.
These results prompted us to evaluate the impact of the microbiota on BLP + Mɸs. The colon harbors the largest amount of microorganisms in the body, where commensal bacterial and fungal populations share the intestinal niche ( Donaldson et al., 2016 19. Donaldson, G.P. ∙ Lee, S.M. ∙ Mazmanian, S.K. Gut biogeography of the bacterial microbiota Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :20-32 Crossref Scopus (1622) PubMed Google Scholar ; Leonardi et al., 2018 44. Leonardi, I. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Semon, A. ... CX3CR1 + mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess the potential effect of bacteria and fungi on the formation of BLPs, we treated mice with a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail or anti-fungal agents. While there was no effect of antibiotics ( Figure 4 A), two anti-fungal agents, fluconazole and amphotericin B, significantly decreased the number of BLPs ( Figures 4 A and 4B) without altering the total number of Mɸs ( Figure S5 A). We have previously highlighted that these drugs efficiently reduce the amount of intestinal fungi in mice ( Wheeler et al., 2016 95. Wheeler, M.L. ∙ Limon, J.J. ∙ Bar, A.S. ... Immunological Consequences of Intestinal Fungal Dysbiosis Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :865-873 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ) but using distinct mechanisms of action ( Anderson et al., 2014 3. Anderson, T.M. ∙ Clay, M.C. ∙ Cioffi, A.G. ... Amphotericin forms an extramembranous and fungicidal sterol sponge Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 :400-406 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bolard et al., 1993 8. Bolard, J. ∙ Joly, V. ∙ Yeni, P. Mechanism of action of Amphotericin B at the cellular level. Its modulation by delivery systems J. Liposome Res. 1993; 3 :409-427 Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar ; Morrow, 1991 57. Morrow, J.D. Fluconazole: a new triazole antifungal agent Am. J. Med. Sci. 1991; 302 :129-132 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tissue staining showed that the number of subepithelial Mɸs was also unchanged in mice treated with anti-fungal drugs ( Figure S5 A), and that these cells displayed long thin protrusions instead of BLPs ( Figure S5 B), as observed in the proximal colon. The combination of fluconazole or amphotericin B with antibiotics showed no additive effect ( Figure 4 C), suggesting that these two anti-fungal agents do not act on BLPs indirectly, i.e., by leading to the expansion of colonic bacteria. These results suggest that distal colon-resident fungi might promote the formation of BLPs in subepithelial Mɸs.
To directly asses the role of fungi in the induction of BLPs, we colonized germ-free mice with altered Schaedler flora (ASF), a well-defined community of eight bacterial species ( Li et al., 2018 46. Li, X. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Semon, A. ... Response to Fungal Dysbiosis by Gut-Resident CX3CR1 + Mononuclear Phagocytes Aggravates Allergic Airway Disease Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :847-856.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), or with the gut fungal pathobiont Candida albicans . Notably, fungal colonization induced strong BLP formation by Mɸs in the distal colon of germ-free mice that were otherwise devoid of these structures, whereas bacterial colonization did not influence the formation of BLPs ( Figure 4 D). No change in the number of subepithelial Mɸs was observed ( Figure S5 A). While colonization of germ-free mice with pathobiont, Candida albicans , led to epithelial cell death, bacteria had no effect ( Figure 4 E). Altogether, these results support a role for the mycobiota in the formation of BLPs in the distal colon, where these microorganisms are particularly abundant.
So far, our results suggest that in the distal colon, there is a population of CD11c high Mɸs that form BLPs in response to local fungi. On the other hand, we found that Mɸ depletion was associated with massive epithelial cell apoptosis in the distal colon but not the proximal one ( Figure 1 ). We, therefore, hypothesized that by forming BLPs, Mɸ might protect epithelial cells from fungi-induced death. Indeed, fungi have been shown to produce many toxic molecules, including toxins and metabolites that can be deleterious for the host ( Bukelskien, 2006 10. Bukelskien, V.

Secretion of E,E-farnesol and biofilm formation in eight different Candida species Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2008; 52 :1859-1861 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test this hypothesis, we pre-treated CD64 DTR mice with anti-fungal agents before Mɸ depletion and assessed the impact of such treatment on epithelial cell survival. Strikingly, we found that anti-fungal treatment rescued the epithelial cells from death in Mɸ-depleted animals ( Figure 4 F). The number of apoptotic colonocytes in mice treated with either fluconazole or amphotericin B prior to Mɸ depletion was comparable to those observed in Mɸ-containing mice. In contrast, epithelial cell death was not rescued when Mɸ-depleted mice were treated with antibiotics ( Figure 4 F). We conclude that fungi are most likely responsible for the death of epithelial cells observed in the distal colon of Mɸ-depleted mice. These results further suggest that Mɸs might protect epithelial cells from fungi-induced cell death.
How do Mɸ detect fungi in the distal colon? Colonic Mɸs use C-type lectin receptors such as Dectin-1,Dectin-2, and Mincle to recognize fungi cell-wall constituents and orchestrate anti-fungal immunity ( Iliev et al., 2012 37. Iliev, I.D. ∙ Funari, V.A. ∙ Taylor, K.D. ... Interactions between commensal fungi and the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 influence colitis Science. 2012; 336 :1314-1317 Crossref Scopus (826) PubMed Google Scholar ; Leonardi et al., 2018 44.

CX3CR1 + mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2018 46. Li, X. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Semon, A. ...

However, we did not observe any difference in the level of expression of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 in Mɸs sorted from the distal and proximal colons ( Figure S5 C). In addition, Dectin-1 KO Mɸs formed similar numbers of BLPs in the distal colon as compared to wild-type animals ( Figure S5 D). These data suggest that BLP + Mɸs might not respond to intestinal fungi through the recognition of β-glucan by Dectins. This is consistent with BLPs not reaching the colon lumen and the microorganisms it contains.
BLP characterization showed that they were filled with membranes from epithelial cells and enriched in endolysosomal compartments ( Figure 2 ). We, therefore, hypothesized that BLPs might sample fungal metabolites/toxins indirectly through the fluids absorbed by the epithelial cells they are in contact with. Indeed, epithelial cells in the distal colon possess specific mechanisms that optimize the absorption of water and facilitate stool dehydration ( Masyuk et al., 2002 51. Masyuk, A.I. ∙ Marinelli, R.A. ∙ LaRusso, N.F. Water transport by epithelia of the digestive tract Gastroenterology. 2002; 122 :545-562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such mechanisms might allow BLP + Mɸs to sample the environment in the absence of direct contact with the local microbiota. To assess whether BLP + Mɸs respond to fluid absorption by epithelial cells, we infused CD11c-Cre/R26 mTmG mice intra-rectally with a hypotonic solution. We found that such treatment increased the number of BLPs as fast as 10 min after infusion ( Figure 5 A) and returned to steady state in 30 min. This increase was also observed when fluid absorption was stimulated by aldosterone injection, a corticosteroid hormone which increases sodium and thus water absorption specifically in the distal colon ( Figure 5 B). To the opposite, when inhibiting water absorption by treating animals with the laxative Bisacodyl, we observed a significant decrease in the number of BLPs ( Figure 5 C). Noticeably, this decrease was abrogated when mice were pre-treated with indomethacin, which inhibits the action of Bisacodyl ( Ikarashi et al., 2011 36. Ikarashi, N. ∙ Baba, K. ∙ Ushiki, T. ... The laxative effect of bisacodyl is attributable to decreased aquaporin-3 expression in the colon induced by increased PGE2 secretion from macrophages Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2011; 301 :G887-G895 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tracing the fluid absorbed through epithelial cells using Alexa-633-labeled hydrazide (a 0.5–1.5 kDa low molecular weight compound) showed an important accumulation of the dye inside the BLP + Mɸ network as fast as 5 min upon infusion ( Figures 5 D and 5F). These results show that the fluid absorbed through the epithelium of the distal colon stimulates the formation of BLPs in associated Mɸs wherein this fluid accumulates. Importantly, we found that the formation of BLPs upon fluid absorption was increased when fungi were present ( Figure 5 E) while the efficiency of epithelial fluid absorption was unchanged ( Figure S5 E), supporting our hypothesis that BLPs sample fluids for the presence of fungal products.
To directly test this hypothesis, we searched for a molecule to be used as a generic fungal metabolite, toxic for epithelial cells when concentrated. We turned our attention to gliotoxin. Indeed, this fungi metabolite was shown to induce apoptosis in epithelial cells ( Upperman et al., 2003 91. Upperman, J.S. ∙ Potoka, D.A. ∙ Zhang, X.R. ... Mechanism of intestinal-derived fungal sepsis by gliotoxin, a fungal metabolite J. Pediatr. Surg. 2003; 38 :966-970 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) and to be produced by both pathobionts and food spoilage fungi such as Penicillium chrysogenum ( Ismaiel and Papenbrock, 2015 38.

Microbiol. 2005; 43 :6120-6122 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is abundant in the murine intestinal tract ( Wheeler et al., 2016 95. Wheeler, M.L. ∙ Limon, J.J. ∙ Bar, A.S. ... Immunological Consequences of Intestinal Fungal Dysbiosis Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :865-873 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, gliotoxin was also found to be produced by Candida spp. , including Candida albicans , even though there are conflicting reports on this subject ( Bertling et al., 2010 7.

Examination of Candida albicans strains from South Africa for the production of gliotoxin and other cytotoxic secondary metabolites J. Yeast Fungal Res. 2016; 7 :19-27 Crossref Google Scholar ). To investigate whether Mɸs can sense fungal metabolites present in the fluids absorbed by epithelial cells, we infused fungi-depleted C57BL/6J mice with a hypotonic solution containing or not containing gliotoxin ( Figure 6 A). We found that gliotoxin-containing solution stimulated BLP-formation as soon as 5 min after the infusion ( Figure 6 B). While the epithelium kept absorbing the gliotoxin-free hypotonic solution, it stopped the absorption of the one containing gliotoxin 20 min upon infusion ( Figure 6 C). Similar results were obtained when using two additional fungi toxins: Candidalysin from pathobiont Candida albicans and T-2 toxin from commensal Fusarium sporotrichoioides ( Marasas et al., 1987 48. Marasas, W.F.O. ∙ Yagen, B. ∙ Sydenham, E. ... Comparative yields of T-2 toxin and related trichothecenes from five toxicologically important strains of Fusarium sporotrichioides Appl. Environ.

Immunological Consequences of Intestinal Fungal Dysbiosis Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :865-873 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 D). These data show that epithelial cells sense and stop absorbing fluids that are poisoned with fungal toxins.
To investigate whether this is an intrinsic capacity of epithelial cells or requires associated BLP + Mɸs, we performed a similar experiment in CD64 WT or CD64 DTR littermates injected with diphtheria toxin (DT) and infused with the gliotoxin-containing hypotonic solution ( Figure 6 E). Remarkably, we found that while DT-injected CD64 WT mice stopped the absorption of the gliotoxin-containing solution, Mɸ-depleted CD64 DTR mice kept absorbing ( Figure 6 E). To assess whether this uncontrolled absorption of gliotoxin had long-term effects on epithelium homeostasis, we infused CD64 WT and CD64 DTR littermates with the gliotoxin-containing hypotonic solution and sacrificed them 6 h later. In these experiments, distal colon epithelial cells underwent massive apoptosis when Mɸs were depleted, confirming that these phagocytes protect epithelial cells from being poisoned by the fungal toxin ( Figure 6 F). We conclude that in the distal colon, Mɸs endow epithelial cells with the ability to recognize toxic fluids and stop absorption, maintaining epithelial integrity and local homeostasis.
These results highlight the essential role of Mɸs in stopping the absorption of toxin-containing fluids through epithelial cells. Are BLPs required for this process? As shown in Figure 2 , BLPs are enriched for CD74 + endolysosomal compartments, and CD74 expression was slightly increased in cluster 1 (log fold change 0.4). CD74, also known as invariant chain, controls MHC class II trafficking to endocytic compartments, and its expression typically leads to the expansion of endolysosomal compartments (reviewed in Schröder, 2016 75. Schröder, B. The multifaceted roles of the invariant chain CD74 — More than just a chaperone Biochim. Biophys. Acta - Mol. Cell Res. 2016; 1863 :1269-1281 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was also shown to enhance the internalization of extracellular fluid by macropinocytosis ( Chabaud et al., 2015 12. Chabaud, M. ∙ Heuze, M.L. ∙ Bretou, M. ... Cell migration and antigen capture are antagonistic processes coupled by myosin II in dendritic cells Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7526 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus hypothesized that CD74 might help BLP + Mɸs internalizing within endolysosomes the fluid and small vesicles released by epithelial cells.
To test this hypothesis, we infused fluconazole-treated CD74 WT and CD74 KO mice with a hypotonic solution containing gliotoxin ( Figure 7 A). We found that the number of BLPs was equivalent in the two groups of mice at steady state ( Figure 7 B). While the number of BLPs increased in wild-type mice 5 min after gliotoxin infusion, it did not in CD74 KO animals, suggesting a decrease in uptake of extracellular fluids. Accordingly, CD74 KO subepithelial Mɸs exhibited reduced level of hydrazide internalization ( Figure 7 C). This result suggests that CD74 is required for BLP formation in response to fluid absorption through epithelial cells, indicating that CD74 KO mice constitute a valuable model to evaluate the implication of BLPs in fluid sampling by Mɸs. Quantification of fluid absorption showed no difference between CD74 WT and CD74 KO 5 min after infusion of gliotoxin ( Figure 7 D, graph). This is consistent with a wild-type epithelium absorbing equivalent amounts of toxin-rich fluid at this early time point ( Figure 6 C). Strikingly, while in wild-type mouse, absorption of gliotoxin-containing solution stopped 20 min after infusion, this decrease in absorption was not observed in the epithelium of CD74 KO mice ( Figure 7 D). In agreement with these results, we found that CD74 KO epithelial cells later undergo massive apoptosis ( Figure 7 E). These findings strongly suggest that BLPs orchestrate fluid sampling by distal colon Mɸs, which is critical to protect epithelial cells from absorbing fluids enriched in fungi toxins/metabolites.

Section: Discussion

The intestinal barrier separates the gut lumen from the internal milieu. It acts as a selectively permeable filter that allows the absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water, which can then reach the blood circulation for organ irrigation. At the same time, because the intestine lumen also contains many toxic substances produced by the microbiota, absorption must be tightly regulated to prevent intoxication and disease. Indeed, dysregulation of intestinal barrier permeability is a leading cause of sepsis-related mortality in critically ill patients and IBD. While mechanisms that regulate intestinal permeability have been widely studied in the small intestine, little is known on how the colon, whose main physiological function is fluid absorption and which contains the highest microorganism burden, protects itself from toxic microbial products.
Here, we describe a mechanism driven by a particular population of CD11c high subepithelial Mɸs, which ensures rapid quality check of absorbed fluids to maintain barrier integrity. For this, Mфs use BLPs inserted at the base of the epithelium, which sample the fluids absorbed through epithelial cells. If fluids are overloaded with fungal metabolites/toxins, Mɸs instruct epithelial cells to stop absorption, preventing epithelial cell poisoning and death. This could for example occur through the secretion of prostaglandin 2 (PGE2) by Mɸs, which decreases Aquaporin localization at the apical membrane of epithelial cells in vitro ( Ikarashi et al., 2011 36. Ikarashi, N. ∙ Baba, K. ∙ Ushiki, T. ... The laxative effect of bisacodyl is attributable to decreased aquaporin-3 expression in the colon induced by increased PGE2 secretion from macrophages Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2011; 301 :G887-G895 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the absence of Mɸs or BLPs, epithelial cells absorb fluids independently of their fungal toxin/metabolite load and undergo apoptosis, compromising barrier integrity. These results suggest that, in homeostasis, the permeability of the intestinal barrier is differentially regulated depending on the local physiological function of the specific intestine segment and on its microbial content. Mɸs thus emerge as key players in the orchestration of such regulation.
In the small intestine, Mɸs form transient transepithelial dendrites visible by live imaging ( Rescigno et al., 2001 68. Rescigno, M. ∙ Urbano, M. ∙ Valzasina, B. ... Dendritic cells express tight junction proteins and penetrate gut epithelial monolayers to sample bacteria Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2 :361-367 Crossref Scopus (2135) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vallon-Eberhard et al., 2006 92. Vallon-Eberhard, A. ∙ Landsman, L. ∙ Yogev, N. ... Transepithelial pathogen uptake into the small intestinal lamina propria J. Immunol. 2006; 176 :2465-2469 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). In response to microbial signals, these protrusions extend between epithelial cells and reach the gut lumen where they capture bacteria or dietary antigens. They express tight-junctional proteins to form adhesions with epithelial cells during crossing the barrier, which ensures the maintenance of the epithelium integrity ( Rescigno et al., 2001 68. Rescigno, M. ∙ Urbano, M. ∙ Valzasina, B. ... Dendritic cells express tight junction proteins and penetrate gut epithelial monolayers to sample bacteria Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2 :361-367 Crossref Scopus (2135) PubMed Google Scholar ). They, therefore, appear as different from the colonic BLPs described here. Although BLPs also penetrate the basement membrane and occupy the intercellular space of the epithelium and do not directly contact the colon lumen. These differences are in line with the distinct properties of epithelia in the small and large bowels. While paracellular permeability is elevated in the small intestine epithelium, reflecting its physiological role in nutrient absorption and establishment of food tolerance, the colonic epithelium exhibits limited paracellular permeability ( Gitter et al., 2000 31. Gitter, A.H. ∙ Bendfeldt, K. ∙ Schulzke, J.D. ... Trans/paracellular, surface/crypt, and epithelial/subepithelial resistances of mammalian colonic epithelia Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439 :477-482 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This helps the colonic epithelium to resist local mechanical stress imposed by elevated osmotic pressure and stool solidification, preventing loss in barrier integrity. Mɸs might, therefore, have developed an alternative sampling strategy in the context of such tightly sealed colonic epithelium. They form BLPs, which sample fluids absorbed through or between epithelial cells, rather than directly engulfing the content of the colon lumen, which contains a huge number of microorganisms. Although the paracellular route allows sampling of the fluid absorbed through the epithelium, a process needed for stool formation, the transcellular route might detect transient events of barrier leakage that result from stretch and shear mechanical insult. These findings suggest that sampling mechanisms by the peripheral immune system are adapted to both the local cues and physiological function(s) of the gut segment.
We unexpectedly found that distal colon BLP + Mɸs respond to the presence of fungi products. Similar results were observed with two different anti-fungal agents, fluconazole and amphotericin B, which target distinct fungal species through different mechanisms ( Anderson et al., 2014 3. Anderson, T.M. ∙ Clay, M.C. ∙ Cioffi, A.G. ... Amphotericin forms an extramembranous and fungicidal sterol sponge Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 :400-406 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bolard et al., 1993 8. Bolard, J. ∙ Joly, V. ∙ Yeni, P. Mechanism of action of Amphotericin B at the cellular level. Its modulation by delivery systems J. Liposome Res. 1993; 3 :409-427 Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar ; Morrow, 1991 57. Morrow, J.D. Fluconazole: a new triazole antifungal agent Am. J. Med. Sci. 1991; 302 :129-132 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results are consistent with fungi being particularly enriched in the distal colon ( Iliev et al., 2012 37. Iliev, I.D. ∙ Funari, V.A. ∙ Taylor, K.D. ... Interactions between commensal fungi and the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 influence colitis Science. 2012; 336 :1314-1317 Crossref Scopus (826) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not obtain any evidence that bacterial compounds stimulate the formation of BLPs. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that bacteria insensitive to the used antibiotics or absent from the ASF flora could still stimulate formation of BLPs.
How do subepithelial BLP + Mɸs detect fungal products? Our data strongly suggest that Dectins might not be involved in this process in homeostatic conditions given that (1) the number of BLPs does not vary between wild-type and Dectin 1 KO mice and (2) the level of expression of these receptors are equivalent in Mɸs isolated from proximal (majority are BLP − ) and distal colon (majority are BLP + ). This is coherent with previous findings showing that the distal colon contains a thick mucus layer that physically separates the microbiota from the epithelial cells; inner parts of this mucus are sterile ( Kamphuis et al., 2017 39. Kamphuis, J.B.J. ∙ Mercier-Bonin, M. ∙ Eutamène, H. ... Mucus organisation is shaped by colonic content; a new view Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :8527 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, in homeostasis, there is no contact between subepithelial Mɸs and the colon lumen, impairing Dectin engagement by their ligands, which are part of the fungal cell wall. Mɸs use BLPs to sample the fluids absorbed through epithelial cells, which carry the whole spectrum of fungal metabolites, providing a comprehensive picture of local mycobiota composition. Whether BLP + Mɸs directly sense fungal products absorbed by the epithelium or detect stress compounds released by poisoned epithelial cells requires additional investigations. This is in sharp contrast with what happens in response to barrier rupture or in the presence of invading fungal species: in that case, Mɸs physically contact fungi and use Dectin-1 to mount effective anti-fungi immune responses ( Iliev et al., 2012 37. Iliev, I.D. ∙ Funari, V.A. ∙ Taylor, K.D. ... Interactions between commensal fungi and the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 influence colitis Science. 2012; 336 :1314-1317 Crossref Scopus (826) PubMed Google Scholar ; Leonardi et al., 2018 44. Leonardi, I. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Semon, A. ... CX3CR1 + mononuclear phagocytes control immunity to intestinal fungi Science. 2018; 359 :232-236 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Similar results were obtained using three different fungi toxins: gliotoxin, which is produced by both pathobionts and commensals, Candidalysin, from pathobiont Candida albicans , and T-2 toxin, from commensal Fusarium sporotrichoioides ( Marasas et al., 1987 48. Marasas, W.F.O. ∙ Yagen, B. ∙ Sydenham, E. ... Comparative yields of T-2 toxin and related trichothecenes from five toxicologically important strains of Fusarium sporotrichioides Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53 :693-696 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In all cases, the number of BLPs increased upon toxin inoculation in fungi-depleted mice, indicating that BLP + Mфs recognize all three fungi metabolites. This result suggests that BLPs do not only respond to fungi compounds produced by pathogenic species but to a broad variety of fungi metabolites. The BLP response may thus be critical not only to sense potentially dangerous fungi species but also to detect the over-growth of commensal fungi, whose metabolites might compromise the survival of epithelial cells if too abundant. Accordingly, we found that commensal fungi are indeed responsible for epithelial cell apoptosis in Mф-depleted mice. Defining the precise nature of the commensal fungi involved will require additional investigations. An interesting candidate is the commensal species Fusarium sporotrichoioides , as it is targeted by both fluconazole and amphotericin B ( Wheeler et al., 2016 95. Wheeler, M.L. ∙ Limon, J.J. ∙ Bar, A.S. ... Immunological Consequences of Intestinal Fungal Dysbiosis Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :865-873 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ) and produce the T-2 toxin ( Marasas et al., 1987 48. Marasas, W.F.O. ∙ Yagen, B. ∙ Sydenham, E. ... Comparative yields of T-2 toxin and related trichothecenes from five toxicologically important strains of Fusarium sporotrichioides Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53 :693-696 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). How BLP + Mфs themselves resist toxins remains an open question; it could be envisioned that BLPs maintain toxins away from the cell body of these cells.
In conclusion, here we highlight a so-far uncovered homeostatic function of CD11c high subepithelial Mфs in the distal colon: they help the epithelium maintain its integrity in an environment subjected to elevated physical and chemical insults that result from osmotic pressure, feces solidification, and an important microbial load. How BLP + Mфs instruct epithelial cells to absorb or not absorb fluids in homeostasis and whether alterations in such mechanisms lead to pathologies such as IBD and cancer shall next be addressed.

Animal care and use for this study were performed in accordance with the European and French National Regulation for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes (2010/63/UE) for the care and use of laboratory animals. Experimental procedures were specifically approved by the ethics committee of the Institut Curie CEEA-IC #118 (AuthorizationAPAFiS#26130-2020062023431460-v1 given by National Authority) in compliance with the international guidelines. All mice were maintained in the SPF animal facility of Institut Curie (Paris, France) prior to use. Germ free (GF) mice were bred and maintained within sterile vinyl isolators at Weill Cornell Medical College Mouse Facility. Altered Schaedler flora (ASF) mice were generated from germ-free wild-type C57BL/6 mice upon inoculation with ASF community ( Li et al., 2018 46. Li, X. ∙ Leonardi, I. ∙ Semon, A. ...

All animal experiments were approved and are in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines at Weill Cornell Medicine. Experiments were performed on 8 to 16 weeks-old male or female mice. CD11c: Cre/R26 mTmG mice were generated by crossing CD11c:Cre +/− mice ( Caton et al., 2007 11. Caton, M.L. ∙ Smith-Raska, M.R. ∙ Reizis, B. Notch-RBP-J signaling controls the homeostasis of CD8- dendritic cells in the spleen J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204 :1653-1664 Crossref Scopus (676) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the tdTomato/GFP reporter mice, where membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed upon Cre activation ( Muzumdar et al., 2007 62. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Tasic, B. ∙ Miyamichi, K. ... A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse Genesis. 2007; 45 :593-605 Crossref Scopus (2578) PubMed Google Scholar ) and labels CD11c compartment. Villin: Cre/R26 mTmG mice were generated by crossing Villin:Cre-ER T2 ± mice, bearing tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombinase in intestinal epithelial cells ( el Marjou et al., 2004 21. el Marjou, F. ∙ Janssen, K.P. ∙ Chang, B.H.J. ... Tissue-specific and inducible Cre-mediated recombination in the gut epithelium Genesis. 2004; 39 :186-193 Crossref Scopus (801) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the tdTomato/GFP reporter mice ( Muzumdar et al., 2007 62. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Tasic, B. ∙ Miyamichi, K. ... A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse Genesis. 2007; 45 :593-605 Crossref Scopus (2578) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tamoxifen (0215673891, MP Biomedicals) was prepared as described previously ( Metzger and Chambon, 2001 55. Metzger, D. ∙ Chambon, P. Site- and time-specific gene targeting in the mouse Methods. 2001; 24 :71-80 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) in sunflower seed oil (S5007, Sigma-Aldrich). In order to induce sufficient labeling of intestinal epithelial cells’ membrane, mice were i.p. injected with tamoxifen stock solution (50 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days. C57BL/6J mice (females) were purchased from Charles River. CD64 DTR ± mice ( Baranska et al., 2018 6. Baranska, A. ∙ Shawket, A. ∙ Jouve, M. ... Unveiling skin macrophage dynamics explains both tattoo persistence and strenuous removal J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :1115-1133 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) were a kind gift from Sandrine Henri and Bernard Malissen and used for macrophage depletion experiments. Animals were i.p. injected with unnicked diphtheria toxin from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (50 μg/kg, solution was prepared in PBS, right before use from 1mg/mL stock solution kept at −80C, 322326, Sigma-Aldrich). Number of injections was dependent on the duration of experiment and on experimental design. For the intestinal barrier integrity experiments, mice received two i.p. injections, 24 h apart and sacrificed 20 h after the second injection. For infusion experiments, mice received one i.p. injection 20 h prior to infusion. CD64 DTR −/− littermates injected with DT were used as a control. CD74 KO/KO mice ( Viville et al., 1993 93. Viville, S. ∙ Neefjes, J. ∙ Lotteau, V. ... Mice lacking the MHC class II-associated invariant chain Cell. 1993; 72 :635-648 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ) were a kind gift from Dr. Hidde Ploegh, CD74 WT/WT littermates were used as control. All treatments were done at the same time of the day, to eliminate any variability resulting from the circadian rhythm and its effects on the intestinal physiology.
To ensure the same segmentation of the colons across the experiments, colons, including intra-basin part and anus, were removed from the animals, washed with PBS (10010001, ThermoFisher Scientific) at room temperature (RT) and separated onto proximal and distal parts ex vivo . First, anus and rectum were cut out (approximately 4 mm from the anus), second proximal colon was defined as the first 1/4 of the residual tube, starting from the caecum; distal colon was defined as last 4/4, and segments were separated with the scalpel. Segments were further perpendicularly cut into 3-4 mm pieces and fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) /PBS solution (5 mL per segment) for 1 h at RT with mild agitation. PFA 4% solution was prepared on the same day (30525-89-4, Electron Microscopy Sciences) with 10xDPBS (1x final concentration, 14080055, ThermoFisher Scientific) and distilled water (15230001, ThermoFisher Scientific). After fixation, tissue was washed 3 times with PBS (10010056, ThermoFisher Scientific) and processed for the staining.
Tissue was dehydrated in 15% sucrose (m/v, S8501, Sigma-Aldrich)/PBS solution for 1 h and after in 30% sucrose/PBS solution for 2 h at RT or overnight (O/N) at 4C (until tissue fragments sunk). After, tissue was embedded with Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT, 4583, Sakura finetek France SAS) in plastic base molds (62352-15, Euromedex), frozen at −20°C and cut on the cryostat using SuperFrost Plus Adhesion slides (631-9483, VWR, Menzel Gläser). Tissue sections were left for several minutes to melt and covered in PBS to prevent drying until the permeabilization step. Sections were after permeabilized with 0.2% Triton x100 (T8787, Sigma-Aldrich)/PBS solution for 1 h at RT; blocked with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, m/v, IgG-Free, Protease-Free, 001-000-162, Jackson Immuno Research), serum of the host of the secondary antibody (donkey or goat serum, depending on the staining, 1:20 dilution, 017-000-121 and 005-000-121 respectively, Jackson Immuno Research) in 0.05% Triton x100/PBS solution for 1 h at RT; and stained with primary antibody O/N in humidified chambers at RT. Sections were then washed 3 times with 0.05% Tx100/PBS solution for 1 h; incubated with secondary antibodies, DAPI and phalloidin, depending on the staining, for 4 h at RT; washed 3 times in 0.05% Tx100/PBS solution for 1 h and mounted using AquaPolyMount (18606-5, Polysciences). In case the FACS-conjugated antibodies were used (CD11c-APC, CD64-BV421) for co-labeling with other antibodies, they were added after the secondary antibody wash-out and incubated O/N at RT. After samples were later washed 3 additional times with 0.05% Tx100/PBS solution for 1 h and mounted. After drying for 1 h in the dry incubator at 37C or O/N at the RT, samples were ready for the imaging. All antibodies (references and dilutions) are presented in Table S3 .
Fixed tissue was sliced perpendicularly to the intestinal length with the scalpel into 1 mm tissue sections and placed in the Eppendorf tubes filled with PBS (1 tube per staining, 4-6 sections per tube). The staining was performed as described above with slight modifications: permeabilization was performed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at RT (500 uL per Eppendorf tube), all antibody solutions and washing steps were performed using 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, under mild shaking conditions (2 mL per Eppendorf tube) and concentration of antibodies was increased (see the Table S3 , 150 uL of the final antibody solution per Eppendorf tube). Incubations with antibodies were done without agitation.
Images were acquired using an inverted confocal microscope (Leica DMi8, SP8 scanning head unit), equipped with HC PL APO CS2 40x/1.30 OIL objective, with a regular pixel size of 284 nm (x, y dimensions), 0,5 −1 um (z dimension) and a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels. For high-resolution BLP structural imaging, deconvolution was used. For these acquisitions we have performed oversampling (pixel size of 36 nm (x, y dimensions) and 0.2 (z dimension)) on the zoomed fragment of the tissue. For all types of acquisition Hybrid Detectors were used. Deconvolution was performed with Huygens Essential Software pack.
Distal colon tissue of CD11c: Cre/R26 mTmG mice was fixed in 4% PFA prepared in 0,1M phosphate buffer from 16% aqueous stock (30525-89-4, Electron Microscopy Sciences) and incubated 1 h at RT with mild agitation. Tissue was then washed 3 times in the regular PBS without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ and cryoprotected by O/N incubation with 2,3M sucrose at 4°. Freezing of the tissue and cryosectioning was done as described above and sections were mounted in PBS: glycerol (1:1) without additional staining. BLPs were located using the inverted confocal microscope (Leica DMi8, SP8 scanning head unit) and obtained their x, y, z coordinates. Coverslips were then removed and samples were processed for the immunegold staining. The immunolabeling of cryosections was done as described previously ( Melo et al., 2014 54. Melo, R.C.N. ∙ Morgan, E. ∙ Monahan-Earley, R. ... Pre-embedding immunogold labeling to optimize protein localization at subcellular compartments and membrane microdomains of leukocytes Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2382-2394 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), with some modifications. In brief, after 30 min in blocking buffer (0,1% gelatin (104070, Merck), 10% Normal goat serum (ab7481, Abcam) and 1% BSA (A9647, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS), sections were immunolabelled with rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (ab290, Abcam) followed by 1.4 nm Nanogold labeled Fab’ anti-rabbit secondary antibody (#2004-5, Nanoprobes). After washing in PBS, sections were fixed in 2% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde for 5 min, washed in water and silver enhanced (HQ Silver enhancement kit, Nanoprobes, NY). Finally, tissue was processed for osmication, dehydration, Epon embedding and sectioned based on the coordinates obtained previously for the each BLPs. Images were acquired with a digital camera Quemesa (SIS) mounted on a Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope (FEI) operated at 80kV. Montage of the EM and fluorescent confocal images was done in AdobePhotoshop.
For preparation of single-intestinal-cell suspension colons were opened with scissors along the intestinal length, proximal and distal colons were separated, washed 3 times in different baths of PBS without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ . Next, tissues were incubated on a magnetic stirrer in complete medium (CM, 2% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in Ca 2+_ , Mg 2+ -free Phenol Red 10X HBSS; H4385 Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA diluted to 1x in filtered H 2 O) in the presence of 1 mM DTT (D9779, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and EDTA (15575-038 from Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min and subsequently incubated with 1 mM EDTA in 5% FBS/ PBS at 37°C for 10min. This was followed by incubation with 15mM HEPES (15630-056 from GIBCO) in 1% FBS/PBS at RT for 7 min without agitation. The supernatants containing intestinal epithelial cells were discarded. Isolated tissues were collected and digested using 0.15 mg/mL Liberase™ TL (054010200001, Roche) and 0.1mg/mL DNase1 (10104159001, Roche) in HBSS at 37°C for 45 min with magnetic agitation. Tissues were then filtered through 100μm cell strainer, and washed in HBSS. Single-cell suspensions were later stained with live-dead stain and Fc-block in a protein-free buffer for 30 min on ice, washed with FACS-buffer (1% BSA, 5% FCS and 2 mM EDTA in PBS), stained with FACS-conjugated antibodies for 20 min on ice, washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. Counting Beads (ACBP-100-10, Spherotech) were used for quantification of cell numbers in the sample and OneComp eBeads Compensation Beads (01-1111-42, Thermofisher Scientific, were used as single-color controls for compensation. Dilutions of reagents can be found in Table S3 . Data was acquired on BD LSRII cytometer and processed with FlowJo vX software. Cell-sorting was performed on BD FACSAria sorter.
Cellular suspension (∼5000 cells, with expected recovery of ∼3000 cells) of sorted Mɸ from proximal and distal colon of 8 weeks old female C57BL/6J mouse were loaded on the 10X Chromium Controller instrument (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, based on the 10X GEMCode proprietary technology, both samples were processed in one batch. The Chromium Single Cell 3¢ v2 Reagent kit (10X Genomics) was used to generate the cDNA and prepare the libraries, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The libraries were then equimolarly pooled and sequenced on a Novaseq 6000 (Illumina) in Paired-end 26x91. A coverage of 400M reads per sample was targeted, in order to obtain 100 000 reads per cell. The raw data were then demultiplexed and processed with the Cell Ranger software (10X Genomics) v2.1.1.
FASTQ files are obtained from BCF files using the cellranger mkfastq command from CellRanger v2.1.1. Sequencing quality is assessed using FastQC v11.8. cellranger count command (default parameters) is used to map the reads to the annotated mm10 genome (accession: GCA_000001635.6, gene build: 2016-01), compute UMI counts, and call cellular barcodes.
The gene-cell expression matrix for each sample is imported in R using Seurat v3.0.0 and normalized as follows: the UMI count of each gene i in cell j is augmented by 1, divided by the total UMI count for cell j , multiplied by 10000, and log-transformed. Cells with less than 200 or more than 4000 detected genes (UMI count 3 1) are filtered out. Only the genes detected in 3 2 cells in at least one sample are retained. Normalized matrices for the two samples are concatenated to obtain a joint normalized matrix M and gene expression is standardized (Z-score) to obtain a scaled matrix M’ .
Feature selection methods and clustering parameters are let vary in order to optimize the definition of the cell populations.
Feature selection is performed on M (defined above) using either mean.var.plot or vst method from Seurat. They both model the expression dispersion of each gene in order to detect the candidates that show the highest variability across cells. For mean.var.plot, the average expression is set in [0.1, 0.1] and the scaled dispersion is 3 d , with d = 0.5, 1, or 1.5. For vst, the number of top highly variable genes retained is either 500, 1000, or 2000.
A PCA dimensionality reduction is possibly performed on M’ (defined above) after feature selection. The first 50 principal components (PCs) are calculated using an SVD approximation. The number of PCs to be retained is automatically defined using the approach defined as follows. First, a p value p h is computed for each component PC h using the JackStraw method (Seurat, default parameters). To identify the contribution to the standard deviation that is likely due to noise, we compute the standard deviation σ noise explained on average by PC 40 ,…, PC 50 . The optimal number of top PCs is set to the maximal h such that the two conditions σ h 3 1.25 σ noise and p h £ 10 −5 simultaneously hold.
Clustering is done using the Waltman and van Eck algorithm, either on the selected features or on the top h PCs, by varying the number of neighbors k in {30, 40, 50} and the resolution parameter r from 0.1 to 0.5 in steps of 0.1. Overall, 180 clustering solutions are generated: 6 ways to select the features, followed or not by PCA, 3 choices for k and 5 choices for r in the clustering step.
Given a clustering solution C, a silhouette width silh(j) is computed for each cell j using the n × n matrix D, where n is the number of cells and D jk is the euclidean distance between cell j and cell k , computed on the same space where C is calculated (features or PCs). The average silhouette width across a cluster c will be referred to as silh(c) .
For each solution, the putative BLP + Mф cluster is defined as the largest whose fraction of cells in the distal colon is greater than in the proximal colon. Among the solutions C whose expected fraction of BLP + Mф (based on IHC) is < 0.4 in the proximal colon and comprised between 0.5 and 0.7 in the distal colon, we select the one such that the average between silh(C) and silh(BLP + Mф) is maximal. The optimal solution contains five clusters (top 1000 variable genes selected with vst, selection of the first 22 PCs, and clustering with parameters k = 30 and r = 0.1). A tSNE is computed (using default parameters) on the same input used for clustering.
Differential expression analysis between each cluster and its complementary or between two clusters is performed using the MAST method on the optimal solution defined at the previous step. Genes detected (UMI count > 0) in 3 10% cells in one of the two conditions, with |log 2 FC| > 0.5, and adjusted p value < 0.05 (Bonferroni correction) are defined as differentially expressed. Two clusters expressing higher level of fibroblast markers (Acta2, Dcn, Des, Lamb1, Lama4, Lamc1, Tpm2, Nid1) and of epithelial cell markers (Krt8, Muc2, Krt19, Car1, Krt18, Car4), respectively, and one cluster expressing lower level of the Mф marker Itgam (Cd11b) are filtered out, resulting in two remainder clusters for downstream analysis, which will be referred to as BLP + Mф and BLP - Mф, respectively.
Processed single-cell RNA-Seq data from monocyte-derived phagocytes in mouse colon are retrieved from (Kang et al.). First, we assess the expression of mature Mф signatures (Schridde et al.), namely, the expression of upregulated genes from P1 (monocytes) to P4 (mature Mф), in the seven Mф sub-populations identified by Kang et al. Second, we compare the two Mф sup-populations whose size is decreased in germ-free mice compared to specific pathogen-free mice, corresponding to clusters 4 and 6 in (Kang et al.), to BLP + Mф and BLP - Mф. The genes tested for differential expression between cluster 4 and 6 that are detected in 3 10% cells in either cluster 4 or 6, with |log 2 FC| > 0.5, and adjusted p value < 0.05 (Bonferroni correction) are defined as differentially expressed. We intersect the upregulated DEGs in BLP + Mф with the upregulated DEGs in cluster 4 and compute the probability of observing an equal or higher odds-ratio (maximum-likelihood estimate) with a Fisher’s exact test (using the R function fisher.test) using the genes detected in at least 20 cells across BLP + Mф and BLP - Mф as background. Comparison of the upregulated DEGs in BLP - Mф and in cluster 6 is evaluated with the same procedure.
Antibiotics cocktail was prepared as described previously ( Qiu et al., 2015 67. Qiu, X. ∙ Zhang, F. ∙ Yang, X. ... Changes in the composition of intestinal fungi and their role in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :10416 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) and contained Ampicillin A9393 1mg/mL+ Gentamicin sulfate G4918 1mg/mL+ Vancomycin 861987 0,5mg/mL+ Metronidazole M1547 1mg/mL+ Neomycin trisulfate salt N1876 1mg/mL (all products purchased at Sigma-Aldrich). For fungi depletion, fluconazole (0,5 mg/mL, F8929, Sigma-Aldrich) and amphotericin B (1 mg/kg, A9528, Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Mice were force-fed for 10 (for fluconazole and antibiotics treatment) or 14 (for amphotericin B treatment) consecutive days by using plastic feeding tubes (FTP-20-38-50, Phymep) greased with Vaseline. Volume of the fed solution was normalized to the weight of an animal (200 uL / 20 g mouse). Solutions were kept at +4C in the dark, and renewed every 5 days.
8-10-week-old germ-free mice were orally either force-fed with Altered Schaedler flora (ASF) or C. albicans . After bacterial or fungal colonization, all mice were maintained within sterile vinyl isolators for 3 weeks and then sacrificed to obtain colonic tissues. For bacterial colonization, cecal contents from a ASF mouse were directly diluted with 5 mL sterile PBS to obtain ASF solution. Then each germ-free mouse was fed with 300 μL ASF cecal contents solution. For fungal colonization, C. albicans strain (SC 5314, (1 × 10 8 CFU/mouse) were cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) and then washed by sterile PBS twice before oral inoculation.
The main driving force for water absorption by colonic epithelium is the osmolarity gradient ( Masyuk et al., 2002 51. Masyuk, A.I. ∙ Marinelli, R.A. ∙ LaRusso, N.F. Water transport by epithelia of the digestive tract Gastroenterology. 2002; 122 :545-562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the colonic stroma osmolarity of 800-1000 mOsmol/kg ( Thiagarajah et al., 2001 87. Thiagarajah, J.R. ∙ Jayaraman, S. ∙ Naftalin, R.J. ... In vivo fluorescence measurement of Na(+) concentration in the pericryptal space of mouse descending colon Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281 :C1898-C1903 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on these studies, we have chosen to infuse the solution which is hypotonic to the stroma (DPBS with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ with osmolarity of 290-315 mOsmol/kg, half-diluted in the distilled water). Solutions were prepared 30 min before the infusion at latest and volumes were adjusted to the weight of the individual mice (150uL per 20 g mouse). Solutions were pre-heated to 37C just before infusion into the animals.
Hydrazide coupled with Alexa Fluor™ 633 (A30634, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to trace fluid absorption. Stock solution (25x, 10 mg/mL) was prepared by diluting 1 mg into 100 uL of sterile distilled water and kept at −20C prior to use. Final infusion solution contained 0,4 mg/mL Hydrazide Alexa Fluor™ 633, DPBS (10x with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ , 1:20 diluted), and sterile distilled water.
Gliotoxin (G9893-5MG, Sigma-Aldrich) solution was prepared and used immediately after the purchase and never kept at −20C or at +4C. Stock solution (383x) was prepared by diluting 5 mg into 1 mL of sterile DMSO. Final infusion solution was prepared on ice and contained 13 μg/mL of Gliotoxin, 0,4 mg/mL Hydrazide-AlexaFluor633, DPBS (10x, 1:20 diluted), and sterile distilled water. Solution was kept on ice in the dark and was heated for 3 min before the infusion.
T-2 (T4887-25MG, Sigma-Aldrich) solution was prepared using DMSO and stored at −80C prior use no longer than 2 weeks. Animals were infused with 1mg/kg of T-2 toxin. Final infusion solution was prepared on ice and contained T-2 toxin, 0,4 mg/mL Hydrazide-AlexaFluor633, DPBS (10x, 1:20 diluted), and sterile distilled water. Solution was kept on ice in the dark and was heated for 3 min before the infusion.
Candidalysin (PCT-4494-v, Peptides International) solution was prepared using DMSO and stored at −80C prior use no longer than 2 weeks. Animals were infused with 75 μg/kg of Candidalysin. Final infusion solution was prepared on ice and contained Candidalysin, 0,4 mg/mL Hydrazide-AlexaFluor633, DPBS (10x, 1:20 diluted), and sterile distilled water. Solution was kept on ice in the dark and was heated for 3 min before the infusion.
To empty the distal colon prior to infusion, mice’s stomachs were massaged 5-7 times with 5 min intervals. Animals were then placed under isoflurane gas anesthesia (2.5% v/v), on the heating pad, their breath rate was monitored and percentage of the isoflurane was adjusted based on the breathing rhythm. If mice were showing signs of suffocation, isoflurane dose was decreased. Efficiency of anesthesia was validated prior to the infusion, by the loss of pedal withdrawal reflex. To avoid dehydration animals were subcutaneously injected with warm 0,9% NaCl, 100 uL per animal. After 10 min from the start of anesthesia administration if pedal withdrawal reflex was lost, pre-heated infusion solution was administrated through 1mL syringe with connected plastic feeding tube (FTP-20-38-50, Phymep). Tube’s tip was immersed in the infusion solution to facilitate the intra-rectal insertion. Because the infusion solution was rapidly excreted in the majority of animals, the excreted solution was collected and re-infused every 5 min.
To monitor the efficiency of systemic absorption through the colon mucosa, mice were infused with Hydrazide Alexa Fluor™ 633 in hypotonic solution as described above. To measure efficiency of absorption into the blood, 2 min 30 s prior to the end of the infusion, thorax was cut open and blood was collected by cardiac puncture from the left ventricle. Since absorption of hemoglobin may interact with absorption/emission of Alexa Fluor™ 633, we applied following procedures to avoid hemolysis, such as: (1) use of pre-heated 20G needles with 1mL syringe (2) horizontal positioning of the syringe during the cardiac puncture to decrease the force applied to collect blood (3) slow blood collection and withdrawal into the 2 mL Eppendorf tubes, on average collection was taking 2 min and withdrawal – 30 s. After the blood collection, Eppendorf tubes were placed in the dark and were left to coagulate for 30 min at RT. After blood was centrifuged at 2200 rcf at 10-15C for 15 min and serum (supernatant) was collected into new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. After the second centrifugation at 2200 rcf at 10-15C for 10 min, serum (supernatant) was placed in 96 well plate, calibration curves were prepared by serial dilutions of Hydrazide Alexa Fluor™ 633, and fluorescence intensity was read on CLARIOstar™ plate reader (BMG LABTECH Inc). To measure the efficiency of epithelial absorption, colon tissues were fixed and stained with phalloidin, DAPI and Laminin antibodies. After z stacks were acquired for every section and amount of Hydrazide positive epithelial cells were quantified and normalized per number of crypts.
We used aldosterone injections to stimulate water absorption specifically in distal colon ( Garty, 2000 28. Garty, H.

Segmental variability of ENaC subunit expression in rat colon during dietary sodium depletion Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444 :476-483 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). To partially repress endogenous aldosterone production, mice received 0.3% of NaCl in drinking water at least 5 days prior to the injection, as described previously ( Fakitsas et al., 2007 24. Fakitsas, P. ∙ Adam, G. ∙ Daidié, D. ... Early aldosterone-induced gene product regulates the epithelial sodium channel by deubiquitylation J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18 :1084-1092 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Turchin et al., 2006 89. Turchin, A. ∙ Guo, C.Z. ∙ Adler, G.K. ... Effect of acute aldosterone administration on gene expression profile in the heart Endocrinology. 2006; 147 :3183-3189 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were after i.p. injected with aldosterone (10 mg/kg, in 0.33% ethanol and 0.9% NaCl, A9477, Sigma-Aldrich), sacrificed after 2, 4, 6 and 8 h and tissue were treated as described above. Control animals were injected with the solvent and sacrificed 2 h and 8 h after the injection.
Bisacodyl, stimulant laxative, which stimulates Cl - secretion in the colon and not in the small intestine was used to decrease water absorption ( Engelhorn et al., 2014 22. Engelhorn, R. ∙ Seeger, E. ∙ Zwaving, J.H. ... Laxatives Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co., 2014 Crossref Google Scholar ; Ikarashi et al., 2011 36. Ikarashi, N. ∙ Baba, K. ∙ Ushiki, T. ... The laxative effect of bisacodyl is attributable to decreased aquaporin-3 expression in the colon induced by increased PGE2 secretion from macrophages Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2011; 301 :G887-G895 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). As described previously ( Ikarashi et al., 2011 36. Ikarashi, N. ∙ Baba, K. ∙ Ushiki, T. ... The laxative effect of bisacodyl is attributable to decreased aquaporin-3 expression in the colon induced by increased PGE2 secretion from macrophages Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2011; 301 :G887-G895 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ), bisacodyl was administrated by oral gavage (20 mg/kg, B1390, Sigma-Aldrich) and mice were sacrificed 5 h later. In addition, indomethacin (10 mg/kg, I7378, Sigma-Aldrich) was i.p. injected 15 min before oral administration of bisacodyl, to inhibit the bisacodyl activity, other conditions received injection of the solvent.
To produce anti-CSF1R antibody we used the hybridoma cell line AFS98, which was cultured in protein-free hybridome medium (PFHM-II GIBCO ref: 12040-077) in disposable reactor cell culture flasks (CELLine 1000 Wheaton ref: WCL1000-1) for 7 days, and antibodies were purified with disposable PD10 desalting columns (GE healthcare ref: 17-0851-01). Mice were i.p. injected with 37.5 mg/kg of antibodies, diluted in PBS every 24 h for 3 consecutive days and killed 24 h after the 3 rd injection.
Image analysis and processing was performed using Fiji software ( Schindelin et al., 2012 73. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quantification of BLPs and Мϕ were performed using the CellCounter build-in plugin, by manually counting the number of BLPs and crypts on every slide of the acquired z stack. 3D reconstructions and movies were created using Imaris software.
For experiments with more than 4 colors staining, un-mixing approach was used to remove fluorophores spillover. As described in ( Gerner et al., 2012 30. Gerner, M.Y. ∙ Kastenmuller, W. ∙ Ifrim, I. ... Histo-cytometry: a method for highly multiplex quantitative tissue imaging analysis applied to dendritic cell subset microanatomy in lymph nodes Immunity. 2012; 37 :364-376 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ), we used single stain tissues to obtain compensation coefficients that were after applied to perform spectral un-mixing using an homemade Fiji macro.
First, we have chosen the fluorophores combination to minimize crosstalk in between fluorescent emissions when It was impossible to separate the dyes on excitation. A maximum of a 9 colors configuration with 4 lasers set up was used ( Figure S6 A). Second, to choose the fluorophore for each particular antigen, we evaluated the staining efficiency. To do so, we performed individual staining for each particular antigen using the same fluorophore and then we attributed the less efficient staining to the channel that receive less spillover contribution from the other channels. Additionally, staining that label the same cells/structures were put in channels with minimized cross-talk. Third, to obtain compensation coefficients, single stained tissues were imaged with the same microscope settings used for tissues stained with the whole panel of antibodies. Coefficients were calculated as described previously ( Roederer, 2002 69. Roederer, M. Compensation in flow cytometry Curr. Protoc. Cytom. 2002; Chapter 1 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) and imported into the matrix ( Figure S6 B). After inverse matrix was calculated using Excel and contained compensation coefficients used for spectral un-mixing. Additional details are available on the macro code.
Statistical significance was calculated between two groups by Mann-Whitney test. Multiple comparison Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn`s and Holm-Sidak’s tests were used to calculate statistical significance between multiple groups. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software. Error bars represent SEM and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant ( ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001).
