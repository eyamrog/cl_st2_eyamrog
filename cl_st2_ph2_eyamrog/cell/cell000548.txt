Title: Transcription factor protein interactomes reveal genetic determinants in heart disease


Abstract: Summary

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is present in 1% of live births, yet identification of causal mutations remains challenging. We hypothesized that genetic determinants for CHDs may lie in the protein interactomes of transcription factors whose mutations cause CHDs. Defining the interactomes of two transcription factors haplo-insufficient in CHD, GATA4 and TBX5, within human cardiac progenitors, and integrating the results with nearly 9,000 exomes from proband-parent trios revealed an enrichment of de novo missense variants associated with CHD within the interactomes. Scoring variants of interactome members based on residue, gene, and proband features identified likely CHD-causing genes, including the epigenetic reader GLYR1 . GLYR1 and GATA4 widely co-occupied and co-activated cardiac developmental genes, and the identified GLYR1 missense variant disrupted interaction with GATA4, impairing in vitro and in vivo function in mice. This integrative proteomic and genetic approach provides a framework for prioritizing and interrogating genetic variants in heart disease.

Section: Introduction

Birth defects are complex developmental phenotypes affecting ∼6% of births worldwide, yet their genetic roots are multifarious and difficult to ascertain ( Christianson and Howson, 2006 23. Christianson, A. ∙ Howson, C.P. March of dimes Global Report on Birth., 2006 Google Scholar ; Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, 2015 28. Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study Large-scale discovery of novel genetic causes of developmental disorders Nature. 2015; 519 :223-228 Crossref Scopus (685) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particularly challenging are rare disorders and more common complex defects with high allelic and locus heterogeneity. In recent years, whole-exome sequencing has accelerated our understanding of such disorders, including the most common birth defect, congenital heart disease (CHD) ( Zaidi et al., 2013 131.

Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat.

Genomic analyses implicate noncoding de novo variants in congenital heart disease Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :769-777 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). De novo monogenic aberrations were found to collectively contribute to ∼10% of CHD cases, whereas rare inherited and copy number variants have been identified in ∼1% and 25% of cases, respectively ( Zaidi and Brueckner, 2017 130. Zaidi, S. ∙ Brueckner, M. Genetics and genomics of congenital heart disease Circ. Res. 2017; 120 :923-940 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, polygenic and oligogenic inheritance models, where multiple genetic variants with epistatic relationships are implicated, have been proposed as mechanistic explanations for certain complex phenotypes. A recent study from our group highlighted the involvement of genetic modifiers in human cardiac disease ( Gifford et al., 2019 41. Gifford, C.A. ∙ Ranade, S.S. ∙ Samarakoon, R. ... Oligogenic inheritance of a human heart disease involving a genetic modifier Science. 2019; 364 :865-870 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the net contribution of oligogenic inheritance remains to be determined. Despite the growing catalog of human genome variants, the cause of over 50% of CHD cases remains unknown ( Zaidi and Brueckner, 2017 130. Zaidi, S. ∙ Brueckner, M. Genetics and genomics of congenital heart disease Circ. Res. 2017; 120 :923-940 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A barrier to a complete understanding of CHD’s etiology is its immense genetic heterogeneity. Estimates based on de novo mutations alone indicate that more than 390 genes may contribute to CHD pathogenesis ( Homsy et al., 2015 51. Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ∙ Shen, Y. ... De novo mutations in congenital heart disease with neurodevelopmental and other congenital anomalies Science. 2015; 350 :1262-1266 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). This heterogeneity reduces the statistical power of CHD risk gene analysis with the cohorts currently available. It is estimated that cohorts of approximately 10,000 parent-proband trios would be needed for whole-exome sequencing to detect ∼80% of genes contributing to haplo-insufficient syndromic CHD ( Sifrim et al., 2016 111. Sifrim, A. ∙ Hitz, M.-P. ∙ Wilsdon, A. ..., INTERVAL Study, UK10K Consortium, Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study Distinct genetic architectures for syndromic and nonsyndromic congenital heart defects identified by exome sequencing Nat. Genet. 2016; 48 :1060-1065 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ), highlighting the need for alternative strategies to identify CHD risk genes and to prioritize for potentially causative variants.
Many diseases display tissue-restricted phenotypes but are rarely explained by mutations in genes with tissue-specific expression ( Hekselman and Yeger-Lotem, 2020 49. Hekselman, I. ∙ Yeger-Lotem, E. Mechanisms of tissue and cell-type specificity in heritable traits and diseases Nat. Rev. Genet. 2020; 21 :137-150 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, cardiac malformations have been linked to variants in tissue-enriched cardiac transcription factors (cTFs) that are expressed more widely. Such cTFs typically form complexes with other tissue-enriched and ubiquitous proteins to orchestrate specific developmental gene programs ( Lambert et al., 2018 66. Lambert, S.A. ∙ Jolma, A. ∙ Campitelli, L.F. ... The human transcription factors Cell. 2018; 172 :650-665 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (848) PubMed Google Scholar ). cTF missense variants may disrupt specific interactions with other proteins, affecting their transcriptional cooperativity and causing disease ( Ang et al., 2016 4. Ang, Y.-S. ∙ Rivas, R.N. ∙ Ribeiro, A.J.S. ...

Moskowitz, I.P. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Peterson, M.A. ... Transcription factor genes Smad4 and Gata4 cooperatively regulate cardiac valve development. [corrected] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :4006-4011 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Waldron et al., 2016 122. Waldron, L. ∙ Steimle, J.D. ∙ Greco, T.M. ... The cardiac TBX5 interactome reveals a chromatin remodeling network essential for cardiac septation Dev. Cell. 2016; 36 :262-275 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation suggests a functional relevance for cTF interactors in genetic disorders, including CHD. In agreement, Barshir et al. (2014) 7. Barshir, R. ∙ Shwartz, O. ∙ Smoly, I.Y. ... Comparative analysis of human tissue interactomes reveals factors leading to tissue-specific manifestation of hereditary diseases PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10 :e1003632 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar observed that disease causal genes are often widely expressed across tissues but with a tendency to exhibit more tissue-specific protein-protein interactions in diseased versus unaffected tissues. In CHD specifically, an excess of protein-altering de novo variants from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomic Consortium’s (PCGC’s) cohort were found in ubiquitously expressed chromatin regulators that partner with cTFs to regulate the expression of key developmental genes ( Zaidi et al., 2013 131. Zaidi, S. ∙ Choi, M. ∙ Wakimoto, H. ... De novo mutations in histone-modifying genes in congenital heart disease Nature. 2013; 498 :220-223 Crossref Scopus (616) PubMed Google Scholar ). This led us to hypothesize that protein-protein interactors of cTFs associated with CHD may be enriched in disease-associated proteins, even if these proteins are not tissue specific.
GATA4 and TBX5 are two essential cTFs ( Kuo et al., 1997 65. Kuo, C.T. ∙ Morrisey, E.E. ∙ Anandappa, R. ...

Heterozygous pathogenic variations in TBX5 are a cause of septation defects and other forms of CHD in the setting of Holt-Oram syndrome ( Basson et al., 1997 8.

Heterozygous variations in GATA4 also cause atrial and ventricular septal defects, as well as pulmonary stenosis and outflow tract abnormalities ( Garg et al., 2003 40.

Subsequent studies have demonstrated that TBX5 and GATA4 cooperatively interact on DNA throughout the genome to regulate heart development ( Ang et al., 2016 4. Ang, Y.-S. ∙ Rivas, R.N. ∙ Ribeiro, A.J.S. ...

Complex interdependence regulates heterotypic transcription factor distribution and coordinates cardiogenesis Cell. 2016; 164 :999-1014 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). Disruption of the physical interaction between these cTFs or with other specific co-factors by missense variants can impair transcriptional cooperativity and lineage specification, and ultimately cause cardiac malformations ( Ang et al., 2016 4. Ang, Y.-S. ∙ Rivas, R.N. ∙ Ribeiro, A.J.S. ...

The cardiac TBX5 interactome reveals a chromatin remodeling network essential for cardiac septation Dev. Cell. 2016; 36 :262-275 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the identification of human GATA4 and TBX5 (GT) protein interactors during cardiogenesis could highlight disease mechanisms and aid in predicting the impact of protein-coding variants in CHD.
Here, we leveraged an integrated proteomics and human genetics approach that dissects the protein-protein interactors of endogenous GATA4 and TBX5 in human cardiac progenitor cells to identify and prioritize potential disease genes harboring CHD-associated variants, revealing aspects of cardiac gene regulation. This approach can be leveraged to study the genetic underpinnings of many human diseases.

Section: Results

To identify the GATA4 and TBX5 protein interactome (GT-PPI) in human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiac progenitors (CPs), we used antibodies against each endogenous cTF for affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) ( Figure 1 A). Using CRISPR-Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoproteins, we generated clonal TBX5 or GATA4 homozygous knockout (KO) hiPSC lines as negative controls. These control lines were differentiated to CP and cardiomyocyte (CM) stages, and the absence of the respective cTF expression was confirmed ( Figure S1 A–S1E). Consistent with previous reports ( Kathiriya et al., 2021 60. Kathiriya, I.S. ∙ Rao, K.S. ∙ Iacono, G. ...

Narita, N. ∙ Bielinska, M. ∙ Wilson, D.B. Cardiomyocyte differentiation by GATA-4-deficient embryonic stem cells Development. 1997; 124 :3755-3764 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), GATA4 and TBX5 KO cells were able to differentiate into CMs, albeit with delayed beating and reduced differentiation efficiency ( Figures S1 E–S1G; Tables S1 A and S1B).
GATA4 or TBX5 mass spectrometry data were generated from three replicates of nuclei-enriched day 6 hiPSC-derived CPs from wild-type (WT) or KO samples treated with RNase and DNase to focus on nucleic acid independent interactions ( Figure 1 A). An initial list of GT interactors in WT CPs was obtained by scoring the proteins identified in WT AP-MS experiments to their corresponding KO control line using the established protein-protein interaction algorithm SAINTq ( Teo et al., 2016 115. Teo, G. ∙ Koh, H. ∙ Fermin, D. ... SAINTq: Scoring protein-protein interactions in affinity purification - mass spectrometry experiments with fragment or peptide intensity data Proteomics. 2016; 16 :2238-2245 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). For further stringency, additional filtering was applied for the high-scoring interactors determined by SAINTq based on nuclear localization and co-expression in the same cells as the bait protein. Proteins whose mRNA was downregulated in the KO cells compared to WT were excluded (see STAR Methods: Selection of interactome proteins ). This approach yielded 272 proteins in total, which comprised several of the previously reported GATA4 and TBX5 interactors as well as novel interactors ( Enane et al., 2017 32.

Cell. 2016; 36 :262-275 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutations in several of these interactors have been previously associated with human or mouse cardiac malformations, highlighting the potential of our approach for disease-gene discovery ( Figures 1 B, 1C, S2 A, and S2B; Tables S1 C and S1D).
Consistent with the interdependence of GATA4 and TBX5 during cardiac development, their networks showed some overlap, but the bulk of the detected interactors were unique to each cTF ( Figure S2 C). Both networks were enriched in proteins involved in similar biological processes ( Figures 1 B–1D, S2 A, and S2B). The top two most represented processes were transcription regulation and chromatin modification ( Figure 1 D), as expected from the cTFs’ well-established functions in gene regulation. Both known and previously unreported low-abundance TFs were found to interact with GATA4 and/or TBX5 (e.g., ZFPM1, ZNF787, SALL3, ZNF219, and MAB21L2) demonstrating the sensitivity of the AP-MS approach ( Figures 1 B, 1C, S2 A, and S2B). Chromatin modifiers (∼25% or 15% of GATA4 or TBX5 interactors, respectively) predominantly belonged to ATP-dependent complexes, and we found several histone-modifying enzymes in the GATA4-PPI ( Figures 1 B, 1C, S2 A, and S2B) ( Enane et al., 2017 32. Enane, F.O. ∙ Shuen, W.H. ∙ Gu, X. ... GATA4 loss of function in liver cancer impedes precursor to hepatocyte transition J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 :3527-3542 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). A number of RNA processing and splicing proteins, as well as members of the nuclear pore complex, were also identified ( Figures 1 B, 1C, S2 A, and S2B). The GT-PPIs mostly included proteins expressed ubiquitously, with a small number of tissue-enriched and cell-type enriched interactors ( Figures 1 E and S2 D).
To determine whether the GT interactors identified in human CPs might help predict genetic risk factors for CHD, we assessed their intersection with de novo variants (DNVs) and very rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] < 10 −5 ) inherited loss-of-function (LoF) variants found in CHD probands from the PCGC. In addition to a previously published cohort of parent-offspring CHD trios and control trios ( Jin et al., 2017 56. Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1593-1601 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ), we included variant data from an additional 419 CHD probands and their parents for a total of over 3,000 trios. We used a permutation-based statistical test to analyze the frequency of variants in GT-interacting proteins among the CHD probands compared to the control group (see STAR Methods: Permutation-based test ). Briefly, the observed odds ratio (OR) of finding a DNV in an interactome gene was adjusted by a factor correcting for synonymous mutation frequency (adjusted OR), then compared to a distribution of odds ratios in which the case/control status of the dataset was permuted (permuted ORs) ( Figure 2 A). The analysis indicated that protein-altering DNVs were significantly more likely to be found within GT interactors in the CHD cohort relative to the control cohort (adjusted OR GATA4-PPI: 5.59 and adjusted p value 0.001; TBX5-PPI: 4.34 and adjusted p value 0.0096). By contrast, very rare inherited LoF variants occurred in GT-PPI proteins with the same frequency in control and CHD groups ( Figure 2 B; Table S1 E).
To determine whether the enrichment was predominately driven by genes previously known to be involved in cardiac development ( Figure S3 A), we removed a published curated list of genes involved in human or mouse cardiac malformations from the dataset ( Jin et al., 2017 56. Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1593-1601 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) and repeated the permutation-based analysis ( Table S1 F). We still found an enrichment in proteins harboring protein-altering DNVs from CHD probands in both GATA4 and TBX5 interactomes ( Figure 2 B; Table S1 E). Similar trends were observed holding out a smaller list of 144 published human CHD genes ( Table S1 E) ( Izarzugaza et al., 2020 54. Izarzugaza, J.M.G. ∙ Ellesøe, S.G. ∙ Doganli, C. ..., Competence Network for Congenital Heart Defects, Germany Systems genetics analysis identifies calcium-signaling defects as novel cause of congenital heart disease Genome Med. 2020; 12 :76 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although our AP-MS analysis was conducted in human CP cells for endogenous TBX5 and GATA4, most PPIs have been identified in less biologically relevant cells and upon overexpression. To assess the importance of biological context, we generated GT-PPIs in kidney cells (HEK293) overexpressing human GATA4 or TBX5 and subjected them to the same permutation analysis with the CHD and control cohorts ( Figures S3 B–S3D; Tables S1 G and S1H). There was no significant enrichment in proteins harboring CHD-associated protein-altering DNVs ( Figure 2 B; Table S1 E). The GT-PPI overlap between cell types was small, with only 20 GATA4 and 13 TBX5-interactors shared ( Figures S3 B–S3D; Tables S1 G and S1H), highlighting the importance of endogenous tissue-specific protein-protein interactions in elucidating the genetic underpinnings of human diseases.
In a complementary analysis to test whether genes in the GT-PPI were enriched for protein-altering DNVs in CHD probands, we permuted the list of interactors and tallied the number of variants found in each gene set. This allowed us to compare the null distribution of the number of variants found in otherwise-comparable non-GT-PPI genes to what we observed in interactome genes. For each gene in the GT-PPI, we identified other genes that had comparable de novo mutability scores ( Samocha et al., 2014 107. Samocha, K.E. ∙ Robinson, E.B. ∙ Sanders, S.J. ... A framework for the interpretation of de novo mutation in human disease Nat. Genet. 2014; 46 :944-950 Crossref Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further narrowed the list of matches based on similarity of expression levels in WT CP cells. The observed number of protein-altering DNVs was significantly higher in GT-PPI genes compared to permuted selections of non-interactome genes with similar mutability and expression (Bonferroni-adjusted p = 0.009). Conversely, there was no enrichment of non-synonymous or rare inherited LoF variants among GT-PPI genes ( Table S1 I).
Having demonstrated that the GT-PPI was enriched in protein-altering variants found in CHD patients, we aimed to assess the likelihood that the GT-PPI variants contribute to disease. Using combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) scores, we found that GT-PPI protein-altering variants found in the CHD cases were more likely predicted to be deleterious than the rest of protein-altering DNVs in CHD cases outside the GT interactome ( Figure 2 C).
We next asked whether the candidate CHD genes identified in the GT-PPI exhibited features that could increase their likelihood of causing disease compared to the remaining non-interactome genes mutated in CHD probands. Extreme intolerance to LoF variation and haplo-insufficiency are common features of genes associated with developmental disorders ( Fuller et al., 2019 38. Fuller, Z.L. ∙ Berg, J.J. ∙ Mostafavi, H. ... Measuring intolerance to mutation in human genetics Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :772-776 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, most candidate CHD genes in the PPI were extremely intolerant to LoF variation (probability of being intolerant to LoF [pLI] > 0.9) and exhibited significantly higher pLI and haplo-insufficiency scores than genes outside the interactome with protein-altering DNVs ( Figures 3 A and S3 E). Another feature of disease genes is an increased tendency for their products to interact with one another when their mutations result in similar phenotypes ( Goh et al., 2007 42. Goh, K.-I. ∙ Cusick, M.E. ∙ Valle, D. ... The human disease network Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :8685-8690 Crossref Scopus (2412) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on iRefIndex database information ( Razick et al., 2008 100. Razick, S. ∙ Magklaras, G. ∙ Donaldson, I.M. iRefIndex: a consolidated protein interaction database with provenance BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9 :405 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ), the proteins encoded by our candidate genes had a higher connectivity degree with other proteins found to be mutated in the CHD cohort as well as with a curated list of proteins involved in mouse/human cardiac malformations ( Jin et al., 2017 56. Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1593-1601 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) than proteins outside the interactome with protein-altering DNVs ( Figures 3 B and 3C).
GT interactors with protein-altering DNVs among those with CHD exhibited higher expression in the developing heart than genes with protein-altering DNVs outside the GT-PPIs ( Figure 3 D), but they generally displayed a broad expression pattern across most cell types ( Figures 3 E and S3 F–S3I) and largely involved proteins relevant to chromatin biology ( Figure 3 F). Other biological processes with unexplored roles in CHD were affected, such as RNA splicing and protein folding ( Figure 3 F). Furthermore, although many DNVs in GT interactors were detected in probands suffering from CHD with extracardiac abnormalities and/or neurodevelopmental defects, a sizeable number were also found in “isolated” CHD cases ( Figure S3 J; Table S1 J).
We next investigated the specific types of protein-altering de novo CHD variants corresponding to proteins in the GT-PPIs. Among the 272 proteins in the GT-PPI, we identified 20 LoF DNVs and 53 missense DNVs present in CHD cases ( Table S1 J). The odds of a DNV occurring in a GT-PPI gene was substantially greater in CHD probands compared to controls for both LoF (adj. OR 4.96) and missense DNVs (adj. OR: 3.76) ( Table S1 K). LoF DNVs preferentially affected genes involved in human and mouse cardiac malformations, whereas the bulk of GT-PPI genes with CHD-missense DNVs had not previously been linked to cardiac development or CHD ( Tables S1 J and S1K). The contribution of de novo splice variants could not be determined due to their low counts in interactome genes from cases and controls ( Tables S1 J and S1K).
The GT-PPI framework combined with trio sequencing allowed us to significantly reduce the number of candidate variants in individual genomes to 20 LoF and 53 missense DNVs in genes encoding protein partners of cTFs that may contribute to CHD. However, even after this significant filtering step, the interpretation of missense variants remains a challenge and requires methods to prioritize those that could substantially impact human phenotypes.
Many variant prioritization methods have been described to date, and most integrate widely accepted variant and gene features to rank potential candidate variants based on the combined evidence of the variant’s predicted deleterious effect on protein function, the harboring gene’s accumulated mutational damage, and its biological relatedness to known CHD-causing genes ( Eilbeck et al., 2017 31.

De novo variants in exomes of congenital heart disease patients identify risk genes and pathways Genome Med. 2020; 12 :9 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the development of a score that would work universally is theoretically difficult, and a common finding of many genetic studies is that gene-set specific rules for pathogenicity are required for proper evaluation ( Eilbeck et al., 2017 31. Eilbeck, K. ∙ Quinlan, A. ∙ Yandell, M. Settling the score: variant prioritization and Mendelian disease Nat. Rev. Genet. 2017; 18 :599-612 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, most of these methods were designed for singleton sequencing studies and fail to incorporate proband pedigree information that can aid prioritizing variants with potential greater effect within an individual ( Farwell et al., 2015 34. Farwell, K.D. ∙ Shahmirzadi, L. ∙ El-Khechen, D. ...

Stark, Z. ∙ Dashnow, H. ∙ Lunke, S. ..., Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance A clinically driven variant prioritization framework outperforms purely computational approaches for the diagnostic analysis of singleton WES data Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2017; 25 :1268-1272 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we developed an integrative pipeline customized for the CHD trio whole-exome-sequencing dataset to calculate a variant prioritization score for the 53 missense DNVs mapped to our GT-PPI. This scoring method has two steps: (1) variant prioritization based on the consolidation of annotations from a combination of widely used gene and variant metrics to assess variant deleteriousness, together with the gene’s frequency of mutation within our dataset ( Figure S3 K), and (2) re-weighting based on occurrence at a known functional residue/domain and on the presence of other potentially causal variants in the same proband ( Figures 4 A and S4 A). Specifically, at the gene level, a higher score indicates (1) a gene’s low tolerance to LoF variation, (2) connectivity to a high number of proteins involved in cardiac malformations ( Jin et al., 2017 56. Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1593-1601 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) and to PCGC CHD proband variant-harboring proteins based on publicly available PPI information, (3) high cardiac expression compared to other tissues, and (4) high number of PCGC variants within the gene relative to CDS length. At the residue level, a higher score indicates (5) a variant’s increased likelihood of being deleterious to protein function (CADD score) and (6) occurrence at a functional residue or protein domain. At the proband level, through the application of a weighted correction factor, a higher score indicates that (7) the background genetic variation of this individual does not include DNVs or very rare inherited LoF variants in genes known to be involved in cardiac malformations ( Jin et al., 2017 56. Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1593-1601 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) and includes none or fewer variants in other GT-PPI genes. The individual features are combined by rank sum and weighted where applicable (see STAR Methods: Variant scoring ) ( Figures 4 A and S4 A). The resulting score is represented with respect to the gene’s percentile of expression in the developing heart (E14.5), a feature previously shown to be effective for variant filtering in CHD by the PCGC ( Zaidi et al., 2013 131.

De novo variants in exomes of congenital heart disease patients identify risk genes and pathways Genome Med. 2020; 12 :9 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We applied this scoring method to previously identified variants implicated in CHD ( Basson et al., 1999 9. Basson, C.T. ∙ Huang, T. ∙ Lin, R.C. ... Different TBX5 interactions in heart and limb defined by Holt-Oram syndrome mutations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :2919-2924 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Furtado et al., 2017 39. Furtado, M.B. ∙ Wilmanns, J.C. ∙ Chandran, A. ...

Garg, V. ∙ Kathiriya, I.S. ∙ Barnes, R. ... GATA4 mutations cause human congenital heart defects and reveal an interaction with TBX5 Nature. 2003; 424 :443-447 Crossref Scopus (953) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that the method ranked these reference monogenic variants more highly than the few mutations demonstrated to partially contribute to CHD and cause oligogenic disease ( Figure 4 B) ( Gifford et al., 2019 41. Gifford, C.A. ∙ Ranade, S.S. ∙ Samarakoon, R. ... Oligogenic inheritance of a human heart disease involving a genetic modifier Science. 2019; 364 :865-870 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ), even when the mutations affected the same gene. Furthermore, among the top-scoring interactome variants, there were several in proteins known to cause cardiac malformations, consistent with the relevance of this score for identifying gene variants with potential for contributing to disease ( Figure 4 B; Table S1 L).
In order to test whether higher variant prioritization scores indeed translated to greater functional impact of variants, we evaluated the effect of multiple variants on cofactor activity in a luciferase reporter assay using a luciferase reporter containing the PPARGC1a promoter, which is strongly activated by GATA4 ( Padmanabhan et al., 2020 91. Padmanabhan, A. ∙ Alexanian, M. ∙ Linares-Saldana, R. ... BRD4 (Bromodomain-Containing Protein 4) Interacts with GATA4 (GATA Binding Protein 4) to Govern Mitochondrial Homeostasis in Adult Cardiomyocytes Circulation. 2020; 142 :2338-2355 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We selected NKX2-5 , a reference gene with one high and one low scored variant; CHD7 , a CHD gene encoding a GATA4 interactor with four identified missense DNVs; and BRD4 and SMARCC1 , CHD candidate genes and GATA4 interactors, each with two identified missense DNVs in CHD patients. For the GATA4 interactors—CHD7, SMARCC1, and BRD4—each variant’s impact on transcriptional activity was tested in the presence of GATA4. We found that variants with a higher prioritization score exerted a greater effect on the encoded protein’s transcriptional activity ( Figure 4 C).
Next, we aimed to evaluate the benefit of the GATA4 and TBX5 PPI incorporation as a filtering strategy for the identification of CHD candidate genes. To test this, we applied the variant prioritization scoring to all de novo missense variants from probands found in both interactome and non-interactome genes ( Table S1 M). We found that the variant prioritization score’s 75 th percentile was 23 or 22 points higher (score range 0–99) for GT-PPI missense DNVs than for variants in genes outside the GT-PPI network or all unfiltered missense DNVs, respectively ( Figure S4 B). Moreover, 41.5% of interactome missense DNVs ranked within the top quartile of all DNV prioritization scores, and within the top quartile of Developing Heart Expression percentile ( Zaidi et al., 2013 131. Zaidi, S. ∙ Choi, M. ∙ Wakimoto, H. ... De novo mutations in histone-modifying genes in congenital heart disease Nature. 2013; 498 :220-223 Crossref Scopus (616) PubMed Google Scholar ), compared to just 12.4% of unfiltered missense DNVs ( Figure S4 C). Additionally, among the missense DNVs within the top quartile, the average prioritization score was significantly higher for GT-PPI variants than for the unfiltered missense DNVs ( Figure S4 D). In agreement, the proportion of missense DNVs in known CHD-causing genes that belonged to the GT-PPI network (∼30% GT-PPI missense DNVs) was an order of magnitude higher than the corresponding proportion across all observed missense DNVs (∼3% of all missense DNVs) observed in CHD probands. To most-directly test the value of filtering the DNVs with the GT-PPI, we performed a Precision-Recall analysis that provides a performance metric, area under the curve (AUC), estimated for the variant prioritization scoring with or without incorporating information from the GT-PPI. This approach demonstrated that incorporation of the GT-PPI variant-filtering strategy improved the ability of the variant prioritization scoring to predict known CHD-causing variants (GT-PPI filtered variants using VPS, AUC = 0.61 versus Random Classifier, AUC = 0.3; all variants using VPS, AUC = 0.18 versus Random Classifier, AUC = 0.05); furthermore, this outcome was not driven by a confounding effect of GT-PPI-dependent parameters included in the variant prioritization scoring (VPS) re-weighting step, as a modified scoring excluding this feature performed similarly ( Figures S4 E and S4F).
Among the CHD candidate missense DNVs, the majority affected interactome proteins highly expressed in the developing heart, with only 25% occurring in GT interactors outside the top quartile of expression ( Figure 4 B). The genes with lower heart expression generally also exhibited low variant prioritization scores, except for the tuberous sclerosis gene, TSC1 , which is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas ( Figure 4 B) ( Hinton et al., 2014 50. Hinton, R.B. ∙ Prakash, A. ∙ Romp, R.L. ..., International Tuberous Sclerosis Consensus Group Cardiovascular manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex and summary of the revised diagnostic criteria and surveillance and management recommendations from the International Tuberous Sclerosis Consensus Group J. Am. Heart Assoc. 2014; 3 :e001493 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, missense DNVs in GT interactors highly expressed in the developing heart exhibited a broad range of prioritization scores, with a potentially highly pathogenic cluster of variants ranking close to the published reference variants with known strong contribution to CHD, and a more disperse group of variants scoring similarly to the few reference variants with known partial contribution to CHD. Among the missense DNVs with the highest scores, which we hypothesized to be more significant contributors, there were four variants in GT interactors with previously described monogenic contribution to human cardiac defects ( TBX5 , GATA6 , CHD4 , and CHD7 ), and six variants within proteins with yet undescribed functions in human congenital heart malformations ( BRD4 x2 , SMARCC1 , GLYR1 , CSNK2A1 , and SAP18 ) ( Figure 4 B; Table S1 L).
BRD4, GLYR1, and SMARCC1 are chromatin modifiers, in concordance with the observed enrichment of CHD-associated DNVs in genes involved in this process ( Zaidi et al., 2013 131. Zaidi, S. ∙ Choi, M. ∙ Wakimoto, H. ... De novo mutations in histone-modifying genes in congenital heart disease Nature. 2013; 498 :220-223 Crossref Scopus (616) PubMed Google Scholar ). These CHD candidate genes were detected as GATA4 interactors, which was validated by co-immunoprecipitation ( Figures S4 G–S4J). While GLYR1 and SMARCC1 were previously unknown to interact with GATA4, we recently reported a role for a BRD4-GATA4 protein module in the regulation of cardiac mitochondrial homeostasis and showed that deletion of BRD4 during embryonic development ( Tnnt2-Cre ; Brd4 flox/flox ) resulted in embryonic lethality with signs of cardiac dysfunction ( Padmanabhan et al., 2020 91. Padmanabhan, A. ∙ Alexanian, M. ∙ Linares-Saldana, R. ... BRD4 (Bromodomain-Containing Protein 4) Interacts with GATA4 (GATA Binding Protein 4) to Govern Mitochondrial Homeostasis in Adult Cardiomyocytes Circulation. 2020; 142 :2338-2355 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the specific contribution of SMARCC1 to CHD is yet uncertain, its encoded protein, BAF155, is a component of the BAF complex, which orchestrates many aspects of heart development ( Hota and Bruneau, 2016 52. Hota, S.K. ∙ Bruneau, B.G. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling during mammalian development Development. 2016; 143 :2882-2897 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GLYR1 DNV occurred in a patient with atrioventricular septal defects, left ventricle outflow tract obstruction, and pulmonary stenosis, a spectrum of cardiac malformations observed in humans with GATA4 mutations. However, the role of GLYR1 in most tissues, including the heart, remains unexplored.
We therefore investigated the genetic landscape of the de novo GLYR1 variant carrier and identified three LoF and 62 missense variants inherited from their asymptomatic parents, while no other DNVs were found in this proband ( Table S1 N). Interestingly, one of these inherited missense variants occurred in GATA6 , encoding a GATA factor that genetically interacts, and is partially redundant, with GATA4 in cardiac development ( Xin et al., 2006 127. Xin, M. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Molkentin, J.D. ... A threshold of GATA4 and GATA6 expression is required for cardiovascular development Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :11189-11194 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these inherited LoF and missense variants are present in the asymptomatic parents and, therefore, are unlikely to be sufficient to cause cardiac malformations, future studies may assess if any could contribute together with GLYR1 to the cardiac malformations observed in this patient.
GLYR1, also known as NDF, NPAC, or NP60, is a chromatin reader involved in chromatin modification and regulation of gene expression through nucleosome demethylation ( Fang et al., 2013 33.

The GLYR1 missense CHD DNV we detected involved the substitution of a highly conserved proline with a leucine at amino acid (aa) 496 within the β-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (β-HAD) domain, described to mediate the interaction between GLYR1 monomers ( Marabelli et al., 2019 81. Marabelli, C. ∙ Marrocco, B. ∙ Pilotto, S. ...

Montefiori, M. ∙ Pilotto, S. ∙ Marabelli, C. ... Impact of Mutations on NPAC Structural Dynamics: Mechanistic Insights from MD Simulations J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2019; 59 :3927-3937 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since Proline 496 is located within a rigid loop enriched in aromatic residues connecting two tetramerization domains ( Figures 5 A–5C), we hypothesized that its substitution by a leucine would impact the structural dynamics of the GLYR1 β-HAD domain and therefore its ability to acquire certain functional states.
Molecular dynamics (MD) computational simulations predicted that the mutant (GLYR1 P496L ) β-HAD would explore a narrower set of structural conformations than the WT, as shown by the time-dependent evolution of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of frames visited during the trajectories from the reference structure ( Figure S4 K). This result was confirmed by the distribution of the RMSD calculated for every pair of states sampled during the simulations ( Figure 5 D). Furthermore, GLYR1 structural dynamics at the local level, measured by the standard deviations of the atomic positions in the simulations (RMSF), indicated an overall lower flexibility of GLYR1 P496L compared to the WT protein, which was evident in the Rossman-fold domain (262-437 aa) ( Figure 5 E). These data indicated that the P496L variant in GLYR1 induces significant differences in the structural dynamics of the β-HAD domain, at the global and local levels, predicting a general increase in the structural rigidity of this region in GLYR1.
Increased rigidity within the β-HAD domain could affect GLYR1’s capacity to adapt to interacting partner proteins through conformational selection. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the GLYR1 P496L DNV destabilized its physical interaction with GATA4 ( Figures 5 F and S4 L) but not with previously described GLYR1 interactors LSD2, CDK9, or Cyclin T1 ( Figure S4 M) ( Fang et al., 2013 33.

Npac Is a Co-factor of Histone H3K36me3 and Regulates Transcriptional Elongation in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2021; 3 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ). Since previous studies indicated a role for GLYR1 in transcriptional regulation ( Fei et al., 2018 35. Fei, J. ∙ Ishii, H. ∙ Hoeksema, M.A. ... NDF, a nucleosome-destabilizing factor that facilitates transcription through nucleosomes Genes Dev. 2018; 32 :682-694 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2021 129.

Npac Is a Co-factor of Histone H3K36me3 and Regulates Transcriptional Elongation in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2021; 3 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ), we probed whether GLYR1 co-regulates gene expression together with GATA4 and found that co-transfection of GATA4 and GLYR1 increased Nppa -luciferase reporter activity by approximately 15-fold, compared with an 8-fold activation with GATA4 alone. Synergistic transactivation of the Ccnd2 -luciferase reporter by GLYR1 and GATA4 was similarly observed and in both cases was attenuated by the GLYR1 P496L mutation ( Figures 5 G and S4 N).
GLYR1 localizes within chromatin regions rich in histone H3 trimethylated on Lys36 (H3K36me3) at actively transcribed gene bodies to regulate transcription elongation ( Fang et al., 2013 33. Fang, R. ∙ Chen, F. ∙ Dong, Z. ... LSD2/KDM1B and its cofactor NPAC/GLYR1 endow a structural and molecular model for regulation of H3K4 demethylation Mol.

Npac Is a Co-factor of Histone H3K36me3 and Regulates Transcriptional Elongation in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2021; 3 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ). However, knowledge about how GLYR1 is recruited to specific loci or its function in homeostasis and disease is limited. Analysis of gene expression along with GLYR1 genome-wide occupancy during CM differentiation together with H3K36me3 genome-wide distribution by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in hiPSCs and CPs revealed dynamic relocalization of GLYR1 during differentiation of hiPSCs to CPs, with ∼7,400 differentially bound genes (FDR < 0.1) between the two stages ( Figures 6 A and S5 A). K-means clustering of genes differentially bound by GLYR1 based on the three measured variables—GLYR1 ChIP-seq, H3K36me3 ChIP-seq, and RNA expression—highlighted GLYR1 recruitment to 4,246 gene bodies upon differentiation of hiPSCs to CPs (clusters 2 and 3). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that gene programs associated with heart development were enriched in cluster 2, which showed the highest levels of GLYR1 ChIP signal in CPs, whereas cluster 3 was enriched for genes involved in general cellular processes. On the other hand, cluster 1 contained ∼3,155 GLYR1-bound genes in hiPSCs that were lost in CPs, mainly associated with cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis terms ( Figure 6 A; Tables S1 O and S1P). Overall, GLYR1 preferentially bound to transcribed regions of active genes and co-localized with H3K36me3 ( Figures 6 A and S5 A–S5C). Interestingly, GLYR1 occupied ∼50% of the genes upregulated in CPs and marked with H3K36me3 ( Figures S5 A and S5B), suggesting that GLYR1 is recruited to a large set of cardiac genes during CM differentiation.
In CPs, as described in other cell types ( Fei et al., 2018 35. Fei, J. ∙ Ishii, H. ∙ Hoeksema, M.A. ... NDF, a nucleosome-destabilizing factor that facilitates transcription through nucleosomes Genes Dev. 2018; 32 :682-694 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2021 129.

Npac Is a Co-factor of Histone H3K36me3 and Regulates Transcriptional Elongation in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2021; 3 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ), GLYR1 broadly occupied gene bodies, from the first intron to the transcription end site (TES) on average ( Figures S5 C and S5D). On the other hand, GATA4 preferentially occupied distal regulatory elements, though some peaks were found at introns inside gene bodies, similar to GLYR1 ( Figures S5 C and S5D). To investigate GATA4-GLYR1 genomic co-occupancy in CPs, we overlapped the genes where GLYR1 was recruited in CPs (GLYR1 CP : clusters 2 and 3, FDR < 0.1 and Log2FC > 0.5) with genes bound by GATA4 within the gene body window where GLYR1 typically binds (1 st Intron-TES). This analysis found a statistically significant overlap between GLYR1 CP and GATA4-bound gene bodies (Fisher exact p value < 2.2E −16 ; OR: 2.38), identifying a defined subset of GATA4 and GLYR1-bound genes, mostly upregulated in CPs versus hiPSCs (FDR < 0.05) and with greater enrichment in heart development GO terms compared to GLYR1-only and GATA4-only occupied gene bodies ( Figures 6 B, 6C, and S5 E; Tables S1 Q and S1R).
To directly evaluate if GATA4 and GLYR1 regulate the transcription of the genes they co-occupy, we analyzed the effect of silencing GATA4 or GLYR1 on the expression of genes in CPs by bulk RNA-seq ( Tables S1 S and S1T). GLYR1 silencing led to reduced expression of more than 800 genes associated with embryonic development and heart development terms compared to a control siRNA, which suggested a functional relevance for GLYR1 in the transcriptional regulation of the CM differentiation process ( Figure S5 F; Tables S1 S and S1U). Genes co-bound by GATA4 and GLYR1 were about seven times more likely to be significantly downregulated by both GATA4 and GLYR1 independent knockdowns compared to those not co-bound ( Figure S5 G). Several co-occupied and co-regulated loci ( GATA4 , GATA6 , TBX5 , LRP2 , TEMN4 , CC2C2A , TTN , and ENDRA ) are involved in human or mouse cardiac malformations ( Figure 6 D) ( Chauveau et al., 2014 21.

The observation that GATA4 mainly occupies intronic regions within GATA4:GLYR1-bound gene bodies led us to examine features characteristic of active or repressed gene regulatory elements ( Akerberg et al., 2019 1.

GATA4 occupancy within GATA4:GLYR1-bound gene bodies co-localized with high levels of marks associated with active regulatory elements (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and MED1), as well as with TFs TBX5, MEIS1, ISL1, and NKX2-5, but with undetectable levels of the repressive mark H3K27me3 ( Figures 6 E and S5 H). Similarly, GATA4 in GATA4-only genes occupied multi-TF intronic regions, but, on average, with lower levels of marks associated with active regulatory elements and higher levels of the repressive mark H3K27me3, in line with GATA4 acting as a repressor in about half of GATA4-only bound neural genes ( Figures 6 C, S5 E, and S5H). The GATA4 co-localization with multiple TFs in GATA4:GLYR1 co-bound genes raised the possibility that GLYR1 interacted with other cTFs. However, GLYR1 co-immunoprecipitation assays in CPs demonstrated that while GLYR1 interacted with GATA4, it did not interact with the other cTFs tested, including NKX2-5, TBX5, ISL1, and MEIS1 ( Figure S5 I), each of which had motif enrichment in GATA4 occupied regions ( Table S1 V) ( Akerberg et al., 2019 1. Akerberg, B.N. ∙ Gu, F. ∙ VanDusen, N.J. ... A reference map of murine cardiac transcription factor chromatin occupancy identifies dynamic and conserved enhancers Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4907 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To test whether GATA4 and GLYR1 interact to positively regulate gene expression, we cloned several intronic regions with the features described above into a luciferase reporter vector under control of a minimal promoter and tested the transactivation ability of GLYR1 and GATA4. Transfection of GATA4 alone resulted in activation of all three reporters, whereas GLYR1 alone induced luciferase activity of two out of three tested reporters, indicating that these intronic locations could function as response elements ( Figure 6 F). Importantly, co-transfection of GATA4 and GLYR1 increased activity of each reporter, consistent with functional co-regulation. The synergistic/additive activation induced by GLYR1 WT was strongly attenuated in the context of the GLYR1 P496L mutation ( Figure 6 F).
In order to better characterize the impact of the P496L missense variant in GLYR1 protein function and gene regulation during CM differentiation, we created an hiPSC line homozygous for the missense variant P496L ( GLYR1 P496L ) by CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair ( Figures S6 A and S6B). In parallel, we generated a GLYR1 KO hiPSC line and verified the reduction of RNA expression and absence of detectable protein ( Figures S6 C and S6D).
In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), GLYR1 is essential for pluripotency, and depletion of GLYR1 leads to differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis ( Yu et al., 2021 129. Yu, S. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Ji, G. ... Npac Is a Co-factor of Histone H3K36me3 and Regulates Transcriptional Elongation in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2021; 3 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ). Similar to mESCs, GLYR1 deficiency in hiPSCs resulted in a dramatic shift in the transcriptional landscape ( Figure S6 E), characterized by a reduction in pluripotency and cell cycle gene expression and upregulation of tumor suppressors and apoptosis genes compared to GLYR1 WT . However, these changes were not observed in GLYR1 P496L hiPSCs, which were more transcriptionally similar to GLYR1 WT cells ( Figures S6 E and S6F). These results suggested that GLYR1 is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency in hiPSCs and that the P496L variant does not lead to a complete protein loss of function.
We then subjected the GLYR1 WT and GLYR1 P496L lines to CM differentiation and investigated their transcriptional landscapes at the CP (day 6) and CM stages (day 18) by scRNA-seq. At day 6 of differentiation, we observed three distinct subpopulations comprising both GLYR1 WT and GLYR1 P496L cells clustering together and expressing marker genes associated with CPs (cluster 0), endoderm (cluster 1), and vascular/endothelial cells (cluster 4), as well as a neural progenitor-like cluster mainly comprising GLYR1 P496L cells (cluster 2) ( Figures 7 A, 7B, and S6 G; Table S1 W). GLYR1 expression was detected in all clusters, whereas GATA4 was only detected in the CP (cluster 0), endoderm (cluster 1), and the vascular/endothelial (cluster 4)-like clusters ( Figure S6 H). The intersection of the scRNA-seq analysis with GLYR1 and GATA4 ChIP-seq at differentiation day 6 from GLYR1 WT revealed that the CP-like cluster was enriched for genes co-bound by GATA4 and GLYR1 ( Figure S6 I). Differential expression analysis (FDR < 0.05, LogFC > 0.125) between GLYR1 P496L and GLYR1 WT CP subpopulations (cluster 0) identified 1,458 downregulated genes involved in heart development, cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle, response to hypoxia, and ATP metabolic processes; 1,025 genes were upregulated and associated with non-cardiomyocyte developmental processes ( Figure 7 C; Tables S1 X and S1Y). Remarkably, more than 35% of the GATA4:GLYR1 co-bound genes were differentially expressed between GLYR1 P496L and GLYR1 WT CPs, whereas less than 15% of GATA4-only and GLYR1-only bound were differentially expressed ( Figure 7 D). ChIP-seq revealed that GLYR1 occupancy was reduced in the GLYR1 P496L CP-like cluster among GATA4:GLYR1 co-bound genes whose expression was shown to be downregulated, but not on those whose expression was upregulated or not changed ( Figures 7 E, 7F, S6 J, and S6K). Importantly, GLYR1 genome-wide binding was not affected by the P496L variant ( Figure S6 L). These data suggest that the P496L variant affects GLYR1 occupancy and transcriptional regulation of a discrete set of target genes co-bound by GATA4, several of which have been involved in human cardiac malformations and cardiomyopathies.
At day 18 of differentiation, we observed a heterogenous group of cellular subpopulations with significantly imbalanced contributions from GLYR1 P496L and GLYR1 WT cells. GLYR1 P496L cells mainly contributed to neural-like (clusters 2, 3, 5, and 9) and hepatocyte-like (cluster 7) subpopulations, to the detriment of CM-like clusters 0 and 6 ( Figures 7 G, 7H, and S7 A; Tables S1 Z and S1AA). The impaired CM-like differentiation of the GLYR1 P496L line was also evident in the diminished cTNT levels detected by FACs and immunostaining ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Within the CM-like clusters, GLYR1 P496L versus GLYR1 WT cells were homogenously distributed, and no segregation between genotypes was observed based on maturity markers ( Figure S7 B). However, differential expression analysis identified 544 downregulated genes in GLYR1 P496L CMs (FDR < 0.05; logFC > 0.125 GLYR1 P496L versus GLYR1 WT ), mainly associated with precursor metabolites and energy generation, particularly ATP metabolic processes. Additionally, 803 genes were upregulated in GLYR1 P496L CMs (FDR < 0.05; logFC > 0.125 GLYR1 P496L versus GLYR1 WT ) involved in cell adhesion and migration, protein phosphorylation, and cell contraction ( Figure S7 C; Tables S1 AB and S1AC). Moreover, GLYR1 P496L CMs exhibited altered beating dynamics characterized by a significant prolongation of physical contraction and relaxation, accompanied by a decrease in the beating rate compared to control cardiomyocytes ( Figure S7 D; Videos S1 and S2 ). Overall, these data demonstrated a detrimental impact of the GLYR1 P496L variant in CM differentiation, associated with altered GLYR1 genomic occupancy and gene regulation at a discrete set of loci co-bound by GATA4.

In order to assess the biological importance of the GLYR1 P496L variant in vivo , we generated a mouse line harboring a P495L single nucleotide variant in GLYR1 ( Glyr1 P495L/+ ), homologous to human P496L, using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing ( Figure S7 E). After backcrossing four generations into the C57BL6/J background, we intercrossed Glyr1 P495L/+ mice and collected 92 pups for genotyping and heart histology at day 1 after birth (P1). Although all genotypes were born at the expected mendelian ratios ( χ 2 = 0.96), 54% of the Glyr1 P495L/P495L and 15.5% of the heterozygous ( Glyr1 P495L/+ ) mice displayed postnatal lethality between days 0 and 1, compared to only 4.4% of the WT littermates ( χ 2 = 0.02 at P1) ( Figure S7 F). Echocardiography and histological analysis revealed ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in ∼15% of the Glyr1 P495L/P495L mice ( Figures S7 G and S7H; Videos S3 and S4 ). Thus, this model provides evidence for the biological importance of GLYR1 in cardiac development and demonstrates a deleterious effect of the P495L variant in vivo .

To assess whether there is a GATA4-GLYR1 genetic interaction in mice, we crossed Glyr1 P495L/+ mice to GATA4 mutant mice ( Watt et al., 2004 125. Watt, A.J. ∙ Battle, M.A. ∙ Li, J. ... GATA4 is essential for formation of the proepicardium and regulates cardiogenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :12573-12578 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ). As expected, Gata4 +/− mice exhibited partially penetrant cardiac defects with a 22% incidence of VSDs, and 50% died between day 0 and day 1, consistent with previous reports for Gata4 deletion in C57BL6/J background ( Figures 7 K and S7 I) ( Rajagopal et al., 2007 98. Rajagopal, S.K. ∙ Ma, Q. ∙ Obler, D. ... Spectrum of heart disease associated with murine and human GATA4 mutation J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 43 :677-685 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glyr1 P495L/+ mice exhibited the expected low penetrance of cardiac alterations, most frequently a persistent interatrial communication (patent foramen ovale), whereas no defects were detected in the 23 WT littermate hearts analyzed ( Figures 7 K and S7 I). We only identified eight compound heterozygote ( Glyr1 P495L/+ :Gata4 +/− ) animals out of 88 pups at birth (∼9.1% observed versus 25% expected, χ 2 = 0.0086), and five of those died in the first 24 h of life ( Figure S7 I). Whole-mount histology and echocardiography analysis showed that all compound Glyr1 P495L/+ :Gata4 +/− hearts were dysmorphic, with complete penetrance of cardiac septal defects, including about 80% represented by atrio-ventricular septal defects (AVSDs) ( Figures 7 K, S7 I, and S7J; Videos S5 and S6 ). These data provide in vivo evidence for the biological relevance of the GLYR1 P495L variant and its interaction with GATA4 in human disease.

Section: Discussion

Here, we integrated an analysis of the protein-protein interaction network of CHD-associated TFs with human whole-exome-sequencing data to inform the genetic underpinnings of CHD. An unbiased PPI reconstruction for two essential cTFs, GATA4 and TBX5, identified known and previously unreported functional relationships. DNVs in GT-PPIs occurred with significantly greater frequency in CHD patients than healthy controls. Additionally, a consolidative computational framework devised to prioritize variants in GT-interacting proteins identified numerous candidate disease genes, including GLYR1 , a ubiquitously expressed epigenetic reader. GLYR1 widely co-occupied cardiac regulatory elements with GATA4, and the GLYR1 disease variant P496L disrupted the interaction with GATA4 and co-activation of cardiac developmental genes. The importance of the GLYR1 variant and the GATA4-GLRY1 interaction in cardiac development was further confirmed in a mouse model. These findings indicate that the use of tissue- and disease-specific PPIs may partially overcome the genetic heterogeneity of CHDs and help prioritize the potential impact of de novo missense variants present in disease.
The integration of PPI information from publicly available databases with human genetic data has been previously used to prioritize disease candidate variants based on network topological measures ( Bryois et al., 2020 16. Bryois, J. ∙ Skene, N.G. ∙ Hansen, T.F. ..., Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, International Headache Genetics Consortium, 23andMe Research Team Genetic identification of cell types underlying brain complex traits yields insights into the etiology of Parkinson’s disease Nat.

De novo and rare variants at multiple loci support the oligogenic origins of atrioventricular septal heart defects PLoS Genet. 2016; 12 :e1005963 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Since most of the available PPI datasets have been reconstructed in non-physiological settings and cell types not relevant to the disease of interest, some of these methods incorporated RNA expression information to generate predicted “tissue-specific” networks to reduce the number of candidate variants ( Barshir et al., 2014 7. Barshir, R. ∙ Shwartz, O. ∙ Smoly, I.Y. ... Comparative analysis of human tissue interactomes reveals factors leading to tissue-specific manifestation of hereditary diseases PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10 :e1003632 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Magger et al., 2012 78. Magger, O. ∙ Waldman, Y.Y. ∙ Ruppin, E. ... Enhancing the prioritization of disease-causing genes through tissue specific protein interaction networks PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8 :e1002690 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether a protein-protein interaction indeed occurs in the tissue depends on additional factors, and co-expression of both partners is only a necessary initial requirement but not a guarantee for the interaction to occur. Even after the application of these prioritization strategies, the large number of highly ranked candidate variants makes it challenging to identify likely contributing mutations in the absence of additional biologically meaningful information. In contrast, the approach described here allowed us to capture ubiquitously expressed CHD candidate genes that might have tissue-specific effects due to their interaction with tissue-enriched factors. This is of importance, as the majority of known disease genes are broadly expressed across multiple human tissues.
In contrast to single-gene enrichment approaches, the network-enrichment analysis allows the detection of rare CHD candidate genes, but it does so without resolving the relative contributions of specific variants. Hence, downstream prioritization of candidate disease variants is needed to rank the likelihood that specific variants contribute to CHD. For this purpose, the integrative scoring method we developed combines commonly used disease-variant prioritization metrics, including diverse and complementary biological information at the gene and variant levels, together with proband pedigree information. The integration of proband genomic information regarding the co-occurrence of variants in known CHD genes with metrics that predict variant deleteriousness and gene-level parameters allowed prioritization of variants with potentially higher contribution to CHD. Functional investigation will be needed to test whether the identified CHD candidate genes are essential in heart development and to determine the causal nature of the associated variants, as we have done here with GLYR1 . In the future, high-throughput screening methods similar to our integrative PPI-genetic variant scoring pipeline will aid in assessing the vast genomic variation catalog provided by the increasing number of large-scale sequencing studies.
Our integrative proteomics and human genetics approach revealed GLYR1 as a GATA4 interactor in CPs that constitutes a strong candidate gene for CHD. Since the GLYR1 P496L variant impacted the protein structural dynamics and reduced its interaction with GATA4, it suggests that destabilization of tissue-specific protein-protein interactions could result in cardiac-restricted phenotypic manifestation associated with the mutation of a ubiquitously expressed chromatin reader. Evidence from human iPSC-derived CPs and in vivo mouse studies suggests that the GLYR1 P496L functions as a hypomorph with discrete alterations in genome occupancy at a subset of H3K36me3-enriched regions. During CM differentiation, GATA4 physical interaction with GLYR1 may be one of the mechanisms explaining how GLYR1 can bind a specific subset of heart development genes. Disruption of this co-regulation in the context of the P496L variant has detrimental effects in CM differentiation that may contribute to cardiac malformations. Indeed, the genetic interaction observed in mice compound heterozygous for GATA4 and GLYR1 P496L, with a high incidence of atrioventricular septal defects, is in agreement with the GLYR1 variant playing a role in CHD. Given the overlapping functions of GATA4 and GATA6, it will be interesting to determine if the inherited heterozygous missense variant in GATA6 in this proband functions together with the GLYR1 variant to cause disease.
Overall, this work has identified interactors of TFs essential for cardiac development, provided a ranked list of candidate disease variants potentially contributing to CHD, and revealed biology of gene regulation related to cardiac disease. Notably, this tissue- and disease-specific TF network-based approach could be applied with slight modifications of the variant prioritization scoring to other genetic disorders for which large-scale sequencing data are available to highlight disease mechanisms and provide a powerful filter for interrogating the genetic basis of disease.
The variant prioritization scoring developed in this study has been customized specifically for the CHD variant dataset from trio whole-exome sequencing and designed as a complementary method to our interactome filtering approach. Although the principles could be widely applicable to other genetic diseases, disease- and dataset-specific modifications would be necessary for its application in different disease contexts. Further, this study focuses on very rare variants, which are normally depleted from the population, as is the case for the P496L variant in GLYR1. Indeed, as a de novo variant, the likelihood of observing P496L in another sequenced individual is small. Future studies will be needed to determine whether variants in GLYR1 contribute to other cases of CHD or to other diseases in humans.

HEK293 (human [ Homo sapiens ] fetal kidney) and HeLa (human [ Homo sapiens ] cervical cancer) cells were all obtained from ATCC ( https://www.atcc.org/ ). HEK293 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), high glucose, GlutaMAX Supplement (Cat.10566016, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM sodium pyruvate, 2mM non-essential amino acids and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.
The WTC11 human iPSC line (Cat. GM25256, Coriell) was obtained from the Gladstone Stem Cell Core ( https://labs.gladstone.org/stem_cell ). The WTC11 line is used as a normal control by research groups all over the world. This hiPSC line was derived from a skin biopsy from a healthy adult Asian male donor in his early thirties, who showed normal function in a battery of tests. The original fibroblasts were reprogrammed using episomal methods with the following factors: LIN28A, MYC (c-MYC), POU5F1 (OCT4), and SOX2 and pluripotency state and differentiation potential characterized as previously described ( Miyaoka et al., 2014 83. Miyaoka, Y. ∙ Chan, A.H. ∙ Judge, L.M. ... Isolation of single-base genome-edited human iPS cells without antibiotic selection Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :291-293 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All hiPSC clones were recurrently verified free of mycoplasma contamination and checked for normal karyotype. Karyotyping analyses were performed by Cell Line Genetics.
To generate the GATA4 , TBX5 and GLYR1 knockout lines as well as the GLYR1 P496L hiPSC line, WTC11 hiPSCs were dissociated in accutase (Cat. 07920, Stem Cell Technologies), and 250.000 cells were aliquoted per condition and nucleofected with Cas9-ribonucleoprotein complexes (Cas9-RNP) following the Primary Cell Nucleofection P3 Kit manufacturer’s instructions (V4XP-3960, Lonza). For Cas9-RNP complex preparation 180pmol of each synthetic modified sgRNA (Synthego) to target exon4 of GATA4 (GAGGCCCACUCGGCGGGAGG), exon6 TBX5 (GCTTACCTTGTGGTTCTGGTAGG) or the GLYR1 locus at chr16:4811270-4811248 (ATGTATTTCAGGTAGAAATCAGG) and 20pmol of SpCas9-NLS purified protein (QB3 Macrolab, UCB) were diluted into 20 μL of nucleofection buffer prepared as indicated in Primary Cell Nucleofection P3 Kit, mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After 10 min. of incubation, the aliquoted 250.000 cells were resuspended in 20 μL nucleofection buffer containing the corresponding Cas9-RNP complexes, mixed 5-6 times and then transferred to the bottom of a nucleofector well (nucleofector 96 well cassette from the Primary Cell Nucleofection P3 Kit). For the generation of the GLYR1 P496L line, the HDR template (12nM): CCTCAGATATCCTGCAAGGAAACTTTAAGCTTGATTTCTACCTGAAATACATTCAGAAGGA, was added to the Cas9-RNP complexes, prior to transferring into the nucleofector wells. This was repeated for every Cas9-RNP condition. The nucleofector cassette was placed in the nucleofector instrument (Nucleofector 4D system, Lonza) and cells nucleofector using the preset program DS-138. The nucleofection cassette was brought back to sterile hood and 80 μL of Essential 8 medium (E8) (Cat. A1517001, Life Technologies) with 5 μM rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632 2HCl, Cat. S1049, Selleckchem.com ) added into each well and incubated for 10 min. at 37°C. During the incubation time, we removed the hESC-qualified LDEV-free matrigel (Cat. 354277, Corning) from 12 well plates (Corning) pre-coated for 1 h. at 37°C with 0.5ml per well of matrigel and added 2mL of pre-warmed E8 medium plus 5 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632 2HCl) in each well. Then pipetted the nucleofected cells to each of the pre-coted wells with media. After ∼3-5 days, wells with surviving clones were expanded to isolate gDNA for screening. A genomic fragment spanning the gRNA target sites was amplified using primers FW 5′AGAGATCTCATGCAGGGTCG3′ and REV 5′TCATGATGCCTGGCCTTACT3′ for GATA4 with Titanium Taq DNA Polymerase (Cat. 639209, Takara Bio) and primers FW 5′GCAGAAACAGTTGCCCAGAA3′ and REV 5′CAAGGCGAATTTAGAGGGCG3′ for TBX5 or FW 5′ CACCAGTGCACTCTAGCCT 3′ and REV 5′ TGCAGCAAATGAGGTAGGGT 3′ for GLYR1 with Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with GC Buffer (Cat. M0532S, New England BioLabs) and Sanger sequenced (Quintara Biosciences or MCLAB) to identify clones with frameshift insertions/deletions. Synthego ICE analysis was run to identify clones with highest knock-out efficiency ( https://ice.synthego.com/#/ ), which were subsequently subjected to the colony picking and clone sequencing until monoclonal lines were generated. The top 5 sgRNA predicted off-targets ( https://horizondiscovery.com/en/products/tools/crispr-specificity-analysis ) were verified to be intact by sanger sequencing in the final monoclonal lines and checked for normal karyotype (Cell Line Genetics).
Human iPSCs were maintained on tissue culture-treated polystyrene plates (Cat. 430630, Corning) with hESC-qualified LDEV-free matrigel (Cat. 354277, Corning) in Essential 8 medium (E8) (Cat. A1517001, Life Technologies). The medium was changed daily and the hiPSCs were split every 4 – 6 days using Accutase (Cat. 07920, Stem Cell Technologies). The rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632 2HCl, Cat. S1049, Selleckchem.com ) was included in the medium at 5 μM final concentration on the day of passaging.
For human cardiac differentiation into CPs and CMs, we modified the protocols originally developed by Lian et al. and Tohyama et al. to achieve stage-specific, high yield, high-purity cardiac commitment in vitro ( Lian et al., 2013 70. Lian, X. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Azarin, S.M. ... Directed cardiomyocyte differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells by modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling under fully defined conditions Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :162-175 Crossref Scopus (941) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tohyama et al., 2013 119. Tohyama, S. ∙ Hattori, F. ∙ Sano, M. ... Distinct metabolic flow enables large-scale purification of mouse and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12 :127-137 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly hiPSCs were detached from hESC-qualified LDEV-free matrigel (Cat. 354277, Corning) with accutase (Cat. 07920, Stem Cell Technologies) and reseeded on matrigel at 0.6–1.2x10 5 cells per 12well in Essential 8 medium (E8) (Cat. A1517001, Life Technologies) with 5 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632 2HCl, Cat. S1049, Selleckchem.com ) (day-3). We optimized each hiPSC clone individually to identify the best cell seeding density that resulted in high levels of cTNT, NKX2-5, TBX5 and GATA4-positive sheet-like beating CMs at day15 of differentiation. On the next two days, media was changed daily with fresh E8 medium without ROCK inhibitor. On the day of cardiac induction (day0), 6 μM CHIR99021 (Cat. 4423, Tocris) was added for 24 h. in 1ml per well of B27-supplemented (without insulin) RPMI1640 media (Cat. 11875-119, Life Technologies). On day1 media was changed for freshly prepared 6 μM CHIR99021 in B27-supplemented (without insulin) (Cat. A1895601, Life Technologies) RPMI1640 media. At day 2 and 3 IWP4 (Cat. 5214, Tocris) in B27-supplemented (without insulin) RPMI1640 media was added to activate Wnt signaling at a final concentration of 5 μM. At day 4, IWP4 was removed, and 1ml of B27-supplemented (without insulin) RPMI1640 media per was daily added per well (days 4-9). At day 10 the media was changed to regular B27-supplemented (with insulin) (Cat. A1895601, Life Technologies) RPMI1640 hereafter. Typically, in parallel differentiations under identical conditions, WT cells started spontaneous contraction as early as days 7-8 while TBX5-KO and GATA4-KO lines tend to be delayed by 48-96 h., and GLYR1 P496L line showed a delayed beating onset of 24-48 h. To ensure consistency across the differentiations used for experimental proposes, from each differentiation cells were collected at day6 and day15-18 for cTNT, TBX5, NKX2-5 and GATA4 FACS analysis. WT hiPSC-CP samples used for AP-MS corresponded to differentiations with sheet-like beating cardiomyocytes and a minimum of 75% cTNT + , 70% TBX5 + , 70% GATA4 + , 70% NKX2-5 + cells analyzed by FACS at day15 of differentiation. GATA4-KO and TBX5-KO CP samples corresponded to differentiations with sheet-like beating cardiomyocytes, were TBX5 or GATA4 protein absence had been confirmed, and had a minimum of 40% cTNT positive cells at day15 of differentiation. Similarly, GLYR1 P496L samples corresponded to differentiations with sheet-like beating cardiomyocytes and had a minimum of 40% cTNT positive cells.
Adenoviral – Human Type 5 (dE1/E3) viral particles expressing GLYR1 wild-type (Ad-GFP-EF1-h-GLYR1; PFU titer: 1x10 10 PFU/mL), GLYR1 P496L mutant (Ad-GFP-EF1-h-GLYR1 P496L PFU titer: 2x10 9 PFU/mL) or negative control (Ad-EF1a-eGFP; PFU titer: 1.2x10 10 PFU/mL) viral particles, were obtained from Vector Biolabs.
Mice were generated by blastocyst injection of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes consisting of purified Cas9 protein (IDT) and guide RNAs targeting the GLYR1 locus along with a single-stranded oligonucleotide DNA template for homology-directed repair (IDT) that leads to insertion of the P495L mutation along with introduction of a novel BsrI restriction endonuclease site. The single stranded guide RNA (ATGTATTTCAGGTAGAAGTC) was used to target the Glyr1 locus together with the HDR template with the Glyr1 P495L substitution indicated below. Blastocysts were transferred to pseudo-pregnant females and pups were weaned at approximately 4 weeks of age. Founder animals were screened for introduction of the P495L mutation by PCR amplification and restriction digestion with BsrI and confirmed by sequencing. Founder animals were outcrossed to wild types and gremlin transmission of the P495L mutation was confirmed PCR/restriction digestion and sequencing. Animals were outcrossed to C57BL6 wild type mice for 4 generations. A genomic fragment spanning the gRNA target sites was amplified using primers FW 5′TTCCAGTCATTCCTTGCCCC3′ and REV 5′TGATCAGAAGGGTCGGCAAG3′ for Glyr1 with Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with GC Buffer (Cat. M0532S, New England BioLabs) and Sanger sequenced (Quintara Biosciences or MCLAB) for genotyping.

After the incubation, cells were washed 3 times with 1ml of PBS per well followed by a 10 min. incubation on gentle agitation at RT. Immunostained samples were counterstained with DAPI (Cat. 422801, BioLegend) and visualized in a Zeiss Z1 microscope and associated ZEN software.
At CP (day6) or CM (day 15-18) stages of differentiation cells were dissociated in accutase (Cat. 07920, Stem Cell Technologies), and fixed in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes with 1ml of 4% formaldehyde (Cat. 28906, ThermoScientific) for 15 min. on rotation at RT. After the incubation, fixed cells were washed 3 times with 1ml of PBS (without Ca 2+ and Mg2+) followed by centrifugation at 1700 rpm for 3 min and stored at 4°C in 1ml of PBS until processed for staining. For staining, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1700rpm 3min and PBS removed. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of FACS buffer [1x PBS, 5% BSA, 5mM EDTA, 0.25% triton-X] and incubated at RT for 1 h. The permeabilized cells were then pelleted resuspended in 30 μL of staining-A in FACS buffer: mouse monoclonal anti-Cardiac Troponin T [1C11] (1:100) (Cat.

The stained cells were washed/spined down 3 times with 200 μL of FACS buffer and finally resuspended in 200 μL of FACS buffer until analyzed. FACS stained samples were measured using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) or LSRII (BD Biosciences) and further analyzed using Flowjo software ( https://www.flowjo.com/ , FlowJo LLC).
WT, TBX5-KO , GATA4-KO and GLYR1 P496L CMs contractility beat rate parameters were measured from brightfield acquired videos with the Pulse automated analysis software ( https://www.pulsevideoanalysis.com ). Pulse applies patented computer vision algorithms to measure beating signals and their parameters from videos of beating cardiomyocytes. It uses deep learning for detection of noisy signals, enabling robust and accurate measurement of parameters of beating frequency, beat duration and amplitude. Specifically, it captures and quantifies the biomechanical beating of cardiomyocytes by performing motion analysis on the image sequence to capture changes in the image intensity due to cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. This platform has been previously validated in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and showed high correlation with calcium transients and patch-clamp experimental outcomes ( Maddah et al., 2015 75.

R0560S and R0552S, New England BioLabs) enzymes to replace the previous contained ORF for the hGATA4 . The hGLYR1-MYC and hSMARCC1-MYC plasmids (pCMV-T7-cDNA-MYC-IRES2-mCherry-pA; Cat. EX-Z0806-M73 and EX-A6386-M73) were obtained from GeneCopoeia™. The HA-hBRD4 plasmid (p6344 pcDNA4-TO-HA-Brd4FL) was a gift from Peter Howley (Addgene plasmid # 31351; http://n2t.net/addgene:31351 ; RRID: Addgene_31351) ( Rahman et al., 2011 97.

The NKX2-5-3xFlag plasmid was generated by modifying the pcDNA3.1 backbone, where the human NKX2-5 ORF with a C terminus fused 3xFLAG. The allele variants for NKX2-5 , CHD7 , BRD4 , SMARCC1 and GLYR1 were generated by QuikChange II XL Site Directed Mutagenesis (Cat. 200521-5, Agilent Technologies) of the aforementioned plasmids. The EX-Y4729-M06- CHD7- del ATPase domain plasmid was obtained from Kai Jiao laboratory ( Liu et al., 2014 72. Liu, Y. ∙ Harmelink, C. ∙ Peng, Y. ...

WT, GATA4-KO and TBX5-KO hIPSC derived CPs or HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors following manufacturer instructions (FuGene HD, Promega) were lysed in Cell Lysis buffer [20mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 85mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40, freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Cat. 4693132001 Roche and Cat. 4906837001 Sigma-Aldrich)] and incubated on rotator at 4°C for 10 min. Cells were spun down at 2500 rpm for 5min. at 4°C to pellet nuclei and supernatants containing the cytosolic fraction were removed and stored for quality control proposes. Nuclei were resuspended in Nuclear Extraction Buffer (NEB) [20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% NP-40, K-Acetate 110mM, 1 μM ZnCl2, and freshly added Benzonase 2 μL enzyme/mL buffer (Cat. E1014, Millipore), protease and phosphatase inhibitors] and incubated on rotation for 30 min. at 4°C. For CPs, 600 μL NEB were used per 4x 12 well plates of initial CPs (∼100x10 6 ), whereas the nuclei resulting from one 10 mm confluent HEK293 plate were lysed in 300 μL of NEB. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at max speed for 10 min. and the nuclear enriched lysates (supernatants) were moved to clean tubes. Nuclear lysates were then diluted 1:3 in Nuclear Dilution Buffer (NDB) [20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% NP-40, freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors], 1200 μL of NDB for CPs; 600 μL NDB for HEK293. At this step samples can be stored and later used for immunoprecipitation or for western blotting.
The immunoprecipitations (IP) were done as described before ( González-Terán et al., 2016 43. González-Terán, B. ∙ López, J.A. ∙ Rodríguez, E. ... p38γ and δ promote heart hypertrophy by targeting the mTOR-inhibitory protein DEPTOR for degradation Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10477 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Briefly, 50 μL of Dynabeads™ Protein G magnetic (Cat. 10004D, Invitrogen) per IP sample were washed twice with 1ml PBS using a magnetic stand, and resuspended in an equivalent volume to the original volume of beads of PBS. Magnetic beads were then conjugated with a primary antibody: per 50 μL of magnetic Dynabeads 4 μg of mouse anti- GATA-4 Antibody (G-4) (Cat. Sc-25310 X, Santa Cruz), 4 μg mouse anti- TBX5 Antibody (A-6) (Cat. Sc-515536 X, Santa Cruz), 2 μg of anti-Myc tag antibody – ChIP Grade (Cat. Ab9132, Abcam) or 2 μL of GLYR1 anti-sera 7 (James T. Kadonaga Laboratory) were added and incubated on rotation for 1 h. at 4°C. Then, the extra non-conjugated antibody was removed by washing the incubated Dynabeads with 1ml of PBS and twice with 1ml of Nuclear Dilution Buffer (NDB) using the magnetic stand, and resuspended in the initial volume of NDB. At this point the coated Dynabeads are ready for IP. Protein content was quantified by Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay Kit 1 (Cat. 5000201, BioRad) from nuclear enriched lysates and 1mg (immunoblot) or 3mg (mass spectrometry) of total protein per IP of endogenous proteins or 150 μg (immunoblot) or 1mg (mass spectrometry) per IP of ectopically expressed proteins were aliquoted per condition and volumes were equalized with NDB. Prior to adding 50 μL of coated beads per IP sample, 50 μL of the prepared nuclear enriched lysates were set aside as “inputs.” IP samples were incubated with coated Dynabeads 4 h. for endogenous IP or 1 h. for IP of overexpressed proteins, on rotator at 4°C. After incubation, samples were placed in the magnetic stand and supernatants removed and saved as “unbound-fraction” for quality control proposes. Beads were washed 2x with 1ml of NDB, and 3 times with 1ml of NDB buffer without detergent. After the last wash, beads were spun down and tubes put on the magnet to remove the remaining liquid. At this point the IP samples can be processed for mass spectrometry or subjected to immunoblotting.
For immunoblotting, samples were subjected to PAGE-SDS. First, 1x of NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (4X) (Cat. NP0007, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to IP samples or to 25-50 μg of nuclear enriched lysates and boiled at 95°C for 10 min. and 5 min. respectively. Samples were resolved in pre-cast Novex 4%–12% Tris-Glycine gels (Cat. XP04122BOX, Invitrogen) and transferred over night at 35V into polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes for endogenous proteins. For ectopically expressed proteins gels were transferred using iBlot® Transfer Stack, PVDF, mini (Cat. IB4010-32, ThermoScientific) and iBlot™ gel transfer device (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 8 min. at 200V. Membranes were blocked with LI-COR blocking buffer (Cat. 927-40010, LI-COR Biosciences) or 10% BSA in PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween) for 20 min., and incubated overnight on agitation with the primary antibody. Appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibody (Abcam) or fluorophore conjugated secondary antibody (LI-COR) was added for 1 h. at a dilution of 1:5000 followed by detection with ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Cat. RPN2232, GELife Sciences) and exposure to autoradiography film at various time intervals or by digital imaging (LI-COR Odyssey). The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: mouse anti- GATA-4 Antibody (G-4) (Cat. Sc-25310 X, Santa Cruz), mouse anti- TBX5 Antibody (A-6) (Cat. Sc-515536 X, Santa Cruz), anti-Myc tag antibody – ChIP Grade (Cat. Ab9132, Abcam), GLYR1 anti-sera 7 (James T. Kadonaga Laboratory), anti-HA tag antibody – ChIP Grade (Cat. Ab9110, Abcam), anti-MEIS1 antibody (Cat. Ab19867, Abcam), anti-ISL1 antibody (Cat. Ab20670, Abcam), anti- NKX2-5 antibody (Cat. Sc-8697, Santa Cruz), anti-LSD2 antibody (Cat. MBS4751131, MyBioSource), anti-CDK9 antibody (Cat. Sc-13130, Santa Cruz), anti-Cyclin T1 antibody (Cat. Sc-271348, Santa Cruz), and anti-Vinculin Monoclonal Antibody VLN01 (Cat. MA5-11690, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
For mass spectrometry all the IP steps described were processed in protein low-bind sterile Eppendorf tubes (Cat. 022431102, Eppendorf), aliquots specific for mass spectrometry were made for each of the IP buffers and carefully managed to avoid contaminations with filter tips. After the magnetic beads were spun down and the excess of liquid removed, to each IP sample tube another 1ml of NDB was added, beads resuspended and transferred using wide orifice tips to new protein low-bind sterile Eppendorf tubes. IP samples were returned to the magnetic stand and supernatant carefully removed by aspiration. IP samples were spun down again to collect the remaining liquid, placed in the magnet and the remaining liquid removed. Next, we proceeded with on-bead protein digestion. One bead volume (25 μl) of freshly prepared Alkylation Buffer [2M Urea; 50mM Tris, pH8.0; 1mM DTT; 3mM IODO; resuspended in LC-MS high grade water] was added to each IP sample and incubated at RT in the dark for 45 min. while shaking to ensure bead suspension. After incubation, an additional 3mM DTT and 750ng of trypsin per 10 μL of bead volume were added to each tube. IP samples were on-bead digested overnight at 37°C on agitation. The next morning, beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 2000 rpm for 4 min. IP samples were placed in a magnetic stand and supernatants carefully transferred to a fresh 0.5ml protein lo-bind tubes. Beads can be saved at 4°C for quality control. To each 0.5ml tube containing the digested IP supernatants, formic acid at a final concentration of 1% was added to stop the digestion process. The processed samples can be stored at this point at −80°C until desalting. Samples were subjected to desalting with OMICS tips (Agilent) and lyophilization in a speed-vacuum concentrator for 30 min. Lyophilized samples were stored at −20°C until proceeding with mass spec analysis. When ready, lyophilized samples were resuspended in 10 μL of 0.2% formic acid/ 2%acetonitrile immediately before loading into the mass spectrometry instrument. All APMS samples were measured using the Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometrer.
Cells were harvested in TRIzolTM LS reagent (Cat. 10296010, Invitogen) and total RNA was extracted using the Direct-Zol RNA kit (Cat. R2052, Zymo Research) according to manufacturer instruction. 1000ng of RNA were converted to cDNA using SuperScriptTM III First-strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Cat. 18080400, Invitrogen). For Taqman real-time PCR, 1/50 cDNA was applied for quantitative PCR reaction using Taqman Universal PCR master mix (Cat. 4305719, Life technologies). The PCR was conducted in 7900HT Fast Real-Time system (Applied Biosystem). The Taqman probe for enhanced GFP (eGFP) quantification (Mr04097229_mr, ThermoFisher Scientific). All gene expressions were normalized with human GAPDH levels (Hs99999905_m1, ThermoFisher Scientific).
Total RNA was TRIzol-extracted (Cat. 10296010, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and further purified using the Direct-Zol RNA kit (Cat. R2052, Zymo Research) with DnaseI in-column treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantified with Nanodrop (Thermo scientific). After RNA quality control with bioanalyzer Agilent 2100 (Agilent Technologies), Paired-end Poly(A)-enriched RNA libraries were prepared with the Ovation RNA-seq System V2 Kit (Cat. 7102-08, NuGEN; strand specific) from the Gladstone Genomic core. The mRNA-seq libraries were analyzed by Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified using an Illumina Library Quantification Kit (Cat. KK4824, KAPA Biosystems). Libraries were prepared by the Gladstone Genomics Core ( http://labs.gladstone.org/genomics/home ). High-throughput sequencing was done using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument ( http://humangenetics.ucsf.edu/genomics-services/sample-processing/ ).
ChIPseq was performed as previously described ( Alexanian et al., 2021 2. Alexanian, M. ∙ Przytycki, P.F. ∙ Micheletti, R. ... A transcriptional switch governs fibroblast activation in heart disease Nature. 2021; 595 :438-443 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Briefly, CP or hiPSC cells (30 × 10 6 for cTFs and 10 × 10 6 for GLYR1 and histone marks) were pelleted and suspended in 10ml DMEM and cross-linked in 1% Formaldehyde solution (Cat. 28906, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by rocking in room temperature for 10 min. Then glycine (final concentration 0.125M) was added to quench the cross-link for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 rcf for 5 min. at 4°C. Cells were washed with 10ml of cold 1x PBS supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Cat. 4693132001 Roche and Cat. 4906837001 Sigma-Aldrich) and the pellets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at −80°C until use. When ready, cell pellets were incubated in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40, protease/phosphatase inhibitors) for 10 min. on a rotator at 4°C. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (2,500 x g, 5 min., 4°C), resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8, 1% SDS, protease/phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated on a rotator for 30 min. at 4°C. Chromatin was sheared using a Covaris S2 sonicator (Covaris Inc) for 15 min. (60 s cycles, 5% duty cycle, 200 cycles/burst, intensity = 6) until DNA was in the 200–700 base pair range. Chromatin was diluted 3-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2mMEDTA, 16.7mMTris-HCl, pH 8, 167 mM NaCl, protease/phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated with the corresponding primary antibody at 4°C overnight under rotation. Antibody-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using 50 μL of Dynabeads Protein A/Protein G (Cat. 10015D, Invitrogen) per sample at 4°C for 2 h under rotation. After incubation, beads were washed five times (2 min./wash under rotation) with cold RIPA buffer [50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.7% Na-deoxycholate], followed by one wash in cold final wash buffer [1xTE, 50 mM NaCl]. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted at 65°C with agitation for 30 min. in elution buffer [50mMTris-HCl pH 8.0, 10mMEDTA, 1% SDS]. High-salt buffer [250mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 32.5 mM EDTA, pH 8, 1.25M NaCl] and Proteinase K (Cat. P8107s, New England Biolabs Inc (NEB)) were added and crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65°C. Samples were treated with Rnase A, and DNA was purified with AMPure XP beads (Cat. A63881, Beckman Coulter). Fragmented ChIP and input DNA were end-repaired, 5′-phosphorylated and dA-tailed with NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Cat. E7645, New England BioLabs). Samples were ligated to adaptor oligos for multiplex sequencing (Cat. E7335, New England BioLabs), PCR amplified, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 at the Gladstone Institutes.

E8411, Promega) modified reporters in which putative intronic RE co-bound by GATA4 & GLYR1 were cloned. Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 10ˆ5 cells per well and transfected within 24 h. of seeding. Cells were co-transfected with 200 ng of luciferase reporter vector and 20 ng of Renilla luciferase control vector pRL-TK or SV40 (Cat. E2241 or E2231, Promega) in 2.4 μL FuGENE HD (Cat. E2311, Promega) and 43 μl Opti-MEM (Cat. 31985070, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The transfection mix was aliquoted in 5 tubes (1 per condition) and the following conditions were prepared for the luciferase assay using the pANF638L or Ppargc1a promoter PGL4.23 vector: 1.) Control: 600ng of empty vector (EV); 2.) GATA4: 200ng of GFP-GATA4 vector plus 400ng EV; 3.) co-factor (GLYR1, CHD7, SMARCC1, BRD4): 400ng co-factor vector plus 200ng EV and 4.) GATA4+ co-factor: 200ng of GFP-GATA4 vector with 400ng co-factor vector and 5.) GATA4+ mutant co-factor vector: 200ng of GFP-GATA4 vector with 400ng mutant co-factor vector. Cells were collected at 24 h, or 48 h. following transfection. Samples were processed with the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Cat. E1960, Promega) following manufacturer’s instructions and measured with a luminometer (SpectraMax i3).
For analyzing the GATA4–GLYR1 transcriptional synergy within putative intronic REs, GATA4 -bound intronic regions within GATA4 & GLYR1 -bound cardiac development genes that co-localized with H3K27ac, H3K4me1 or H3K4me3, MED1 and at least co-occupied by two cTFs, were cloned with Cold Phusion (Systems Biosciences) by designing gBlocks (IDT) for each of the selected putative REs (GATA6: chr18:19,773,958-19,774,419; MYL4: chr17:45,296,131-45,296,972; TTN: chr2:179,493,152-179,494,179) flanked by homology arms complementary to the pGL4.23[luc2/minP] luciferase reporter vector (Cat. E8411, Promega). HeLa cells were plated as indicated for the pANF638L reporter and transfection mixed prepared as indicated above. The transfection mix was aliquoted in 5 tubes (1 per condition) and the following conditions were prepared for each of the cloned pGL4.23 luciferase reporter vectors: 1.) Control: 200ng of empty vector (EV); 2.) GATA4: 200ng of GFP-GATA4 vector plus Adenovirus control (Ad-EF1a-eGFP, MOI 25); 3.) GLYR1: Adenovirus GLYR1 WT (Ad-eGFP-EF1-h-GLYR1, MOI 25) and 4.) GATA4+GLYR1: 200ng of GFP-GATA4 vector and Adenovirus GLYR1 WT (MOI 25); 5.) GATA4+GLYR1 P496L: 200ng of GFP-GATA4 vector Adenovirus GLYR1 P496L (Ad-eGFP-EF1-h-GLYR1 P496L, MOI 15). The MOIs were determined by HeLa cell infection followed by quantitative PCR amplification with the eGFP Taqman probe (Mr04097229_mr, ThermoFisher Scientific). MOIs rendering comparable eGFP expression levels were chosen for the luciferase experiments (Relative to GAPDH Avg levels for Ad GLYR1 WT MOI 25: 50.134 and Ad GLYR1 P496L MOI 15: 57.333; n = 3). HeLa cells were collected 48 h after transfection/infection and processed as indicated for the pANF638L vector.
Cells were wash with PBS and detached with 0.25% Trypsin (CMs) or accutase (hiPSCs and CPs) incubated for 5 min. Quenched with 1 mL of PBS + 1% FBS and spin down at 800-1000 rpms for 3 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS + 1% FBS, resuspend in cold PBS + 1% FBS (use 0.5mL PBS per well collected from a 12-well-plate) and put on ice. Cells were filtered to avoid clumps and manually count with hemocytometer. Both live and dead cells were included in the count and cells were diluted to 1e6 cells/mL. A total of 60,000 cells were used to proceed with the scRNaseq library construction protocol.
Single-cell droplet libraries from the hiPSC (1x GLYR1 KO , 2x GLYR1 WT , 2x GLYR1 P496L ), CM-differentiation day 6 (3x GLYR1 WT , 3x GLYR1 P496L ) and day 18 (3x GLYR1 WT , 3x GLYR1 P496L ) cell suspensions ( Figures 7 and S6 ) were generated in the 10X Genomics Chromium controller according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v.3 User Guide. Additional components used for library preparation include the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3.1, (PN-1000121, 10X Genomics) and the Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit (PN-1000120, 10X Genomics). Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v.3.1 (PN-1000121, 10X Genomics) and 3′v3.1 Single Index Kit (PN-1000213, 10X Genomics). Final libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq (Illumina, software v1.5). Sequencing parameters were selected according to the Chromium Single Cell v.3.1 specifications. All libraries were sequenced to a mean read depth of at least 50,000 total aligned reads per cell.
To examine hearts at postnatal day 1, hearts were dissected from the animals and fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde. They were then washed twice in PBS and stored in 70% ethanol until processing. Hearts were paraffin embedded and sectioned to obtained a four-chamber view. Heart sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and imaged with a slide scanner.
For echocardiography, newborn mice were imaged using the Vevo 3100 High Resolution Imaging System (FujiFilm VisualSonics Inc.), an ultra-high frequency linear array transducer (MX700). All the echocardiogram analyses were performed blinded (mice assigned to an alphanumeric code) until statistical analysis.
Peptides from affinity purifications were analyzed on a Q-Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher) mass spectrometer. The Q-Exactive Plus system was equipped with an Easy1200 nLC system (Thermo Fisher) and an analytical column (25 cm x 75 um I.D. packed with ReproSil Pur C18 1.9 μm, 120Å particles, Dr. Maisch). A gradient was delivered from 2% to 30% acetonitrile over 53 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. All MS spectra were collected with Orbitrap detection, while the 20 most abundant ions were fragmented by HCD and detected in the Orbitrap. Peptide and protein identification searches, as well as label-free quantitation were performed using the MaxQuant data analysis algorithm (version 1.5.8.0) ( Cox and Mann 2008 25. Cox, J. ∙ Mann, M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26 :1367-1372 Crossref Scopus (8817) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data were searched against a database containing SwissProt Human sequences (downloaded 02/2017) concatenated to a decoy database where each sequence was randomized in order to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR).
Variable modifications were allowed for methionine oxidation and protein N terminus acetylation. A fixed modification was indicated for cysteine carbamidomethylation. Full trypsin specificity was required. The first search was performed with a mass accuracy of ± 20 parts per million (ppm) and the main search was performed with a mass accuracy of ± 4.5 parts per million. A maximum of 5 modifications were allowed per peptide. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed. The maximum charge allowed was 7+. Individual peptide mass tolerances were allowed. For MS/MS matching, a mass tolerance of ± 20 ppm was allowed and the top 12 peaks per 100 Da were analyzed. MS/MS matching was allowed for higher charge states, water and ammonia loss events. The data were filtered to obtain a peptide, protein, and site-level false discovery rate of 0.01. The minimum peptide length was 7 amino acids.
APMS data was analyzed using the artMS package ( Jimenez-Morales et al., 2020 55. Jimenez-Morales, D. ∙ Rosa Campos, A. ∙ Von Dollen, J. ... artMS: Analytical R tools for Mass Spectrometry version 1.6.5 from Bioconductor Bioconductor. 2020; Google Scholar ) in R followed by protein-protein interaction scoring by the SAINTq software ( Teo et al., 2016 115. Teo, G. ∙ Koh, H. ∙ Fermin, D. ... SAINTq: Scoring protein-protein interactions in affinity purification - mass spectrometry experiments with fragment or peptide intensity data Proteomics. 2016; 16 :2238-2245 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify significantly-interacting proteins for GATA4 and TBX5 baits. Default parameters for both softwares were used except where indicated here: To create the GATA4 interactome, we analyze at the protein level and select proteins that interact at a BFDR cutoff of £ 0.001; to create the TBX5 interactome, we analyze at the peptide level and select those that interact at a BFDR cutoff of £ 0.05. Intensity data from the control (knockout) cell lines was normalized per SAINTq configuration options such that the average total intensity in each bait purification was equal to the average total intensity across the control experiments.
To focus on transcriptionally-relevant interactions, we additionally filter proteins by those that appear in the nuclear compartment, those that are expressed at detectable levels in at least one of the same cell types as the bait, and proteins whose gene expression was significantly lower in the control line but did not have a greater than 0.5 log-fold change drop in intensity. Nuclear compartment : nuclear compartment genes were identified using the Cytoscape package BiNGO ( Maere et al., 2005 76. Maere, S. ∙ Heymans, K. ∙ Kuiper, M. BiNGO: a Cytoscape plugin to assess overrepresentation of gene ontology categories in biological networks Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :3448-3449 Crossref Scopus (3028) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shannon et al., 2003 110. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (23829) PubMed Google Scholar ) with additional manual curation from literature. Cell type co-expression : single-cell RNA-seq data from deSoysa et al., 2019 was used to determine if an interaction was likely to occur, given co-expression in the same cell type. Briefly, mesoderm and neural crest cells in the developing heart were used to identify seven cell type populations (multipotent Isl1+ progenitors, endothelial or endocardial cells, epicardium, myocardium, neural crest-derived mesenchyme, paraxial mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm) ( de Soysa et al., 2019 27. de Soysa, T.Y. ∙ Ranade, S.S. ∙ Okawa, S. ... Single-cell analysis of cardiogenesis reveals basis for organ-level developmental defects Nature. 2019; 572 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). A bait protein is considered to be expressed in one of these cell types if the transcripts per million (tpm) for the bait gene were greater than 0.05 tpm. Prey proteins were considered to be potentially physiologically relevant interactors if they were detected at any level in one of the same cell types as the bait. Controlling for differential gene expression : protein hits that were considered likely false positives based on lower expression in the control cell lines, without concomitant reduction in protein intensity, were removed from the interactome list. This is intended to control for genes that are expressed less in the controls due to bait knockout, but whose APMS protein intensities do not change (suggesting the protein pulled down was background rather than an interactor). Significant differential gene expression was determined in R using the edgeR package ( Robinson et al., 2010 106. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (19590) PubMed Google Scholar ); normalized protein intensities were averaged in all control experiments and bait experiments. Proteins with significantly reduced expression in control (FDR £ 0.05) with less than a 0.5 log-fold change drop in intensity were not considered to be interactors.
The categories for gene expression tissue distribution and tissue specificity defined by the Tissue Atlas within the Human Protein Atlas were used to classify the specified gene groups ( https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/tissue+specific ). These classifications are based on transcriptomics analysis across all major organs and tissue types in the human body, where all putative 19670 protein coding genes have been classified with regard to abundance and distribution of transcribed mRNA molecules ( Uhlén et al., 2015 121. Uhlén, M. ∙ Fagerberg, L. ∙ Hallström, B.M. ... Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome Science. 2015; 347 :1260419 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Specificity illustrates the number of genes with elevated or non-elevated expression. Elevated expression includes three subcategory types: • Tissue enriched: At least four-fold higher mRNA level in a particular tissue compared to any other tissues. • Group enriched: At least four-fold higher average mRNA level in a group of 2-5 tissues compared to any other tissue. • Tissue enhanced: At least four-fold higher mRNA level in a particular tissue compared to the average level in all other tissues.
Distribution, on the other hand, visualizes how many genes that have, or do not have, detectable levels (NX 3 1) of transcribed mRNA molecules. All elevated genes are categorized as: • Detected in single: Detected in a single tissue • Detected in some: Detected in more than one but less than one third of tissues • Detected in many: Detected in at least a third but not all tissues • Detected in all: Detected in all tissues
Whole Exome Sequencing data from 2645 CHD trios and 1789 control trios was processed as described and published in Jin et al., 2017. We include Whole Exome Sequencing data from 419 additional CHD trios recruited to the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), processed by the HMS pipeline as described in Jin et al., 2017. Protein-coding mutations were filtered based on a Mapping Quality score > 59 and Genotype Quality > 90, then annotated using ANNOVAR. De novo variants were called using the TrioDeNovo program ( Wei et al., 2015 126. Wei, Q. ∙ Zhan, X. ∙ Zhong, X. ... A Bayesian framework for de novo mutation calling in parents-offspring trios Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :1375-1381 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and accepted if the minor allele frequency (MAF) and read-depth criteria described in Homsy et al., 2015 are met. Namely, the in-cohort MAF of the variant must be below 4x10 −4 , with a minimum of 5 alternative reads and 10 total reads in the proband, and a minimum of 10 reference reads in the parents (with a maximum alternate allele ratio of 3.5%).
Case-control permutation. We tested the adjusted odds ratio of observing a de novo mutation in an interactome gene in CHD probands relative to controls. We ran 10,000 permutations in which case/control status was randomly shuffled to generate a null distribution of permuted odds ratios (Ors). This was performed for protein-altering (non-synonymous) de novo mutations, synonymous de novo mutations, and rare inherited loss-of-function mutations (at minor allele frequency 10 −5 ) ( Jin et al., 2017 56. Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1593-1601 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) on the GATA4 and TBX5 interactomes generated from both cardiac progenitor and HEK293 APMS experiments. The raw p value for each test is equal to the proportion of random shuffles with a permuted OR greater than or equal to the observed OR. P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method. We observed that some genes appeared to have been more deeply sequenced in control individuals, while other genes showed the opposite trend. This is not unexpected, as control individuals in the Jin et al. dataset were sequenced for a different study and at different institutions from PCGC individuals. Therefore, to control for regional biases in sequencing between the case and control studies, we adjusted the odds ratios of the synonymous and protein-altering variant data by a factor that restricts the synonymous odds ratio to 1 (the null expectation). This correction was performed for the observed odds ratio and the odds ratios calculated in each permutation of de novo variants. To determine whether this signal was driven by already-identified CHD risk genes, we repeated the analysis after removing de novo variants occurring in known known Human/Mouse CHD genes (sourced from Jin et al., 2017 56. Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1593-1601 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar , Supplemental Dataset 2: 253 Curated) ( Jin et al., 2017 56. Jin, S.C. ∙ Homsy, J. ∙ Zaidi, S. ... Contribution of rare inherited and de novo variants in 2,871 congenital heart disease probands Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1593-1601 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as after removing a curated list of 144 human CHD-genes ( Izarzugaza et al., 2020 54. Izarzugaza, J.M.G. ∙ Ellesøe, S.G. ∙ Doganli, C. ..., Competence Network for Congenital Heart Defects, Germany Systems genetics analysis identifies calcium-signaling defects as novel cause of congenital heart disease Genome Med. 2020; 12 :76 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Gene-set permutation. For each gene in the GT-PPI, we identify non-interactome genes that are expressed at similar levels in WT CP cells, and have comparable mutability scores as calculated by Samocha et al., 2014. A gene is considered a match if its mutability score (expected number of de novo mutations in this gene per chromosome per generation) is equivalent when rounded to the order of one hundred-thousandth. We further filter the list of matches based on similarity of expression levels in wildtype cardiac progenitor cells, such that the measured transcripts per million (tpm) is equivalent to the order of one one-hundredth. For genes with fewer than 100 possible matches, we relax these requirements by ± 0.5 × 10 N (where N is the relevant order of magnitude), and remove any genes from the analysis in the case of < 10 matches. For 1000 permutations, we permute each interactome gene into one from its list of comparable non-interactome genes to compare the total count of variants found in CHD cases from the GT-PPI interactome versus those across all permuted gene-sets.
All de novo variants and harboring genes observed in CHD probands and matched controls were assessed for the following properties: CADD score, pLI score, variant degree, CHD-gene degree, heart expression percentile rank, haploinsufficiency, and number of mutations per kilobase. The residue-level CADD score ( Rentzsch et al., 2019 101. Rentzsch, P. ∙ Witten, D. ∙ Cooper, G.M. ... CADD: predicting the deleteriousness of variants throughout the human genome Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D886-D894 Crossref Scopus (1261) PubMed Google Scholar ) estimates the likely deleteriousness of a variant based on conservation data. pLI score indicates the predicted loss-of-function intolerance of the gene, scaled between 0 and 1, and was sourced from gnomAD version 2.1.1 ( Karczewski et al., 2020 59. Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Francioli, L.C. ∙ Tiao, G. ..., Genome Aggregation Database Consortium The mutational constraint spectrum quantified from variation in 141,456 humans Nature. 2020; 581 :434-443 Crossref Scopus (2715) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, haploinsufficiency predicts the deleteriousness of having only a single functional copy of a gene. We use the predicted haploinsufficiency values from Huang et al., 2010 ( Huang et al., 2010 53. Huang, N. ∙ Lee, I. ∙ Marcotte, E.M. ... Characterising and predicting haploinsufficiency in the human genome PLoS Genet. 2010; 6 :e1001154 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CHD-gene degree counts the number of protein-protein interactions that the gene shares with previously-identified CHD risk genes, while the variant degree counts the number of protein-protein interactions shared with other genes that had de novo variants (DNVs) in a CHD proband. These node degree counts were normalized by the total number of connections observed in the gene, and are based on known mammalian protein-protein interactions in iRefIndex version 15.0 ( Razick et al., 2008 100. Razick, S. ∙ Magklaras, G. ∙ Donaldson, I.M. iRefIndex: a consolidated protein interaction database with provenance BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9 :405 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the number of mutations per kilobase measures the number of times a de novo or rare loss of function variant was observed in a CHD proband, normalized by the coding length of that gene. We use a Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction to assess whether protein-altering DNVs in interactome genes differ significantly from those in non-interactome genes with respect to these properties, as well as whether protein-altering DNVs in cases differ from those found in controls.
All protein-altering de novo missense variants occurring in GT-interacting genes and observed in CHD probands were ranked based on a series of gene-level, residue-level, and patient-level properties. A mutations per kilobase value was determined for each gene, based on the number of protein-altering de novo and rare loss-of-function mutations found in CHD probands in the PCGC, normalized by the CDS length of that gene in the gnomAD database ( Karczewski et al., 2020 59. Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Francioli, L.C. ∙ Tiao, G. ..., Genome Aggregation Database Consortium The mutational constraint spectrum quantified from variation in 141,456 humans Nature. 2020; 581 :434-443 Crossref Scopus (2715) PubMed Google Scholar ). pLI score indicates the predicted loss-of-function intolerance of the gene, scaled between 0 and 1 where 1 is more intolerant. pLI data was sourced from gnomAD version 2.1.1 ( Karczewski et al., 2020 59. Karczewski, K.J. ∙ Francioli, L.C. ∙ Tiao, G. ..., Genome Aggregation Database Consortium The mutational constraint spectrum quantified from variation in 141,456 humans Nature. 2020; 581 :434-443 Crossref Scopus (2715) PubMed Google Scholar ). CHD-gene degree, variant degree, and mutations per kilobase values were calculated as described above based on known mammalian protein-protein interactions in iRefIndex version 15.0 ( Razick et al., 2008 100. Razick, S. ∙ Magklaras, G. ∙ Donaldson, I.M. iRefIndex: a consolidated protein interaction database with provenance BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9 :405 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see Methods: Interactome CHD Candidate Variant Characterization). Expression specificity was calculated using data from median transcripts-per-million (tpm) as published in GTEx version 8.1.1.9 ( GTEx Consortium, 2017 11. GTEx Consortium Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues Nature. 2017; 550 :204-213 Crossref Scopus (1802) PubMed Google Scholar ). Average median tpm was calculated for heart tissues (adult atrium, adult left ventricle) and all other available tissues with the exception of testis. The specificity score is then defined as the average tpm in heart tissues normalized by average tpm across all tissues.
For each of these properties, the variants were ranked based on their relative scores. Ties were resolved by taking the average value of the would-be ranks. Missing data was imputed to the median value of the given property. Gene-level rankings (mutations per kilobase, pLI score, CHD-gene degree, variant degree, and expression specificity) and residue-level rankings (CADD score) were separately averaged and then summed. This average rank sum was then additionally weighted by two factors to capture aspects of their proband-level and protein contexts.
First, if the proband had additional mutations in other interactome genes or other previously-identified CHD genes, we reduced the variant’s weight. Specifically, we multiply the rank-sum score by the lowest-applicable factor if they meet any of these conditions: Factor Conditions 0.75 Proband has another rare (MAF 10 −5 ) inherited loss-of-function OR missense de novo variant in an interactome gene OR proband has an inherited missense damaging variant in a known CHD gene 0.50 Proband has a predicted-damaging de novo mutation in an interactome gene or rare inherited loss-of-function mutation in a previously-identified CHD gene 0.25 Proband has a de novo missense mutation in a previously-identified CHD gene 0.10 Proband had a de novo missense mutation in a previously-identified CHD gene, and that variant was predicted-damaging or led to protein loss-of-function. Open table in a new tab
To summarize, the variant is down-weighted in cases where it is likely that another mutation in the proband is causing or contributing to the CHD phenotype.
Second, if the de novo variant leads to protein loss-of-function, or if it occurred in a known protein domain (and therefore is suspected to interfere with protein activity), the variant rank-sum was transmitted as-is. Otherwise, the variant’s rank-sum was multiplied by 0.5.
The ability of the Variant Prioritization Score to predict variants known to result in CHD was performed under two scenarios using a Precision-Recall (PR) Analysis. In the first scenario, prediction was performed over all missense DNVs, and in the second one, prediction was restricted to the GT-PPI missense DNVs. The PR analysis was performed using the pr.curve function that is part of the PRROC ( Grau et al., 2015 44. Grau, J. ∙ Grosse, I. ∙ Keilwagen, J. PRROC: computing and visualizing precision-recall and receiver operating characteristic curves in R Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :2595-2597 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ) package in R. The performance of the score was quantified in terms of the Area-Under the Curve (AUC) for the PR curves generated under the two scenarios, relative to the expected AUC from a random classifier under the corresponding scenarios. The expected AUC for the PR curve from a random classifier is equal to the fraction of variants known to cause CHD among all variants used in the prediction.
Sequences of several vertebrate model organisms containing the rigid loop (bridging the two tetramerization alpha helice bundles) of the NPAC proteins’ dehydrogenase domain were aligned using CLC Sequence Viewer 8.0. Amino acids 490-529 were aligned, partially spanning exons 14 and 15 (490-495, 496-5229 respectively) in the H. sapiens sequence. Alignments were created with the “Alignment” function with a gap open cost of 10.0, gap extension cost of 1.0, end gap cost as any other, and the very accurate (slow parameter).

The structure and domains of the NPAC monomer were edited using the PYMOL Molecular Graphics System Version 2.3.5. Domains of the NPAC dehydrogenase domain are defined as by Zhang et al., 2014 ( Zhang et al., 2014 132. Zhang, Y. ∙ Zheng, Y. ∙ Qin, L. ...

The protein is shown through the cartoon function, displaying the general tertiary structure of the protein. Amino acid proline 496 and its mutant proline 496 leucine are shown in gold and through the stick function displaying the secondary structure of the amino acids to delineate the significance in change of structure. In the focused images of the rigid loop of the alpha helices tetramerization bundle, the amino acids are again shown through the stick function to delineate the secondary structure interactions of the amino acids.
The initial protein structure for all-atom MD simulations in explicit water of NPAC was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank, code 2uyy.pdb.
Missing atoms and side chains were added using the Protein Preparation Wizard of the Maestro Suite of Programs (v. 2019−4). Proline to Leucine mutation was also performed using Maestro ( Maestro Schrödinger, LLC, 2019 77. Maestro Schrödinger, LLC Maestro Suite of Programs (v. 2019-4) Maestro Schrödinger, LLC, 2019 Google Scholar ; Sastry et al., 2013 108. Sastry, G.M. ∙ Adzhigirey, M. ∙ Day, T. ... Protein and ligand preparation: parameters, protocols, and influence on virtual screening enrichments J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2013; 27 :221-234 Crossref Scopus (2784) PubMed Google Scholar ). The simulations were run using the same protocol for both the WT and mutated monomer (subunit A).
All systems were allowed to relax with 2000 steps of steepest descent followed by another 2000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization. The temperature of the systems was gradually raised to 300 K in the NVT ensemble in 1.2 ns at 1 fs time-step, using the Langevin thermostat. In particular, six runs of 200 ps were performed increasing the temperature of 50 K at each step (T = 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 K, respectively). At 300 K, the density of the system was adjusted with 1 ns at 2 fs time-step under NPT conditions by weak coupling to a bath of constant pressure (P 0 = 1 bar, coupling time t p = 0.5 ps). The production runs were thus carried out in the NVT ensemble. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm ( Miyamoto and Kollman 1992 82. Miyamoto, S. ∙ Kollman, P.A. Settle: An analytical version of the SHAKE and RATTLE algorithm for rigid water models J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13 :952-962 Crossref Google Scholar ), allowing a time step of 2 fs. Electrostatic forces were computed using the particle mesh Ewald algorithm with a truncation cut-off of 10A° ( Darden et al., 1993 26. Darden, T. ∙ York, D. ∙ Pedersen, L. Particle mesh Ewald: An N×log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98 :10089 Crossref Google Scholar ). The initial velocity of all atoms was obtained from a Maxwellian distribution at the initial temperature of 300 K.
MD simulations where run in 3 independent replicas of 500 ns each (1.5 μs in total per system),
Specifically, MD simulations were performed using Amber18 pmemd.CUDA with the all atom ff14SB force field under periodic boundary conditions ( Case et al., 2018 19. Case, D.A. ∙ Ben-Shalom, I.Y. ∙ Brozell, S.R. ... AMBER 2018 University of California, San Francisco, 2018 Google Scholar ). The triclinic simulative box, filled with TIP3P ( Jorgensen et al., 1983 58. Jorgensen, W.L. ∙ Chandrasekhar, J. ∙ Madura, J.D. ... Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79 :926 Crossref Google Scholar ) water molecules and rendered electroneutral by addition of Na + counterions consists of a final number of atoms of about 41 300 (monomer WT and P496L mutant), particles for each system.
The atomic positions were saved every 10 ps. The equilibrated parts of the trajectories were used for subsequent analyses. Equilibration of the trajectories was checked by monitoring the equilibration of the RMSD with respect to the initial structure and of the internal protein energy. The equilibrated parts of each trajectory for the two systems were next combined into a meta-trajectory, which was subsequently used for all the reported characterizations. Classical structural analyses were carried out with the tools in the Amber18 and Gromacs 4.5.5 package ( Bekker et al., 1993 12. Bekker, H. ∙ Berendsen, H.J.C. ∙ Dijkstra, E.J. ... Gromacs: A parallel computer for molecular dynamics simulations https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=59290415-039c-4900-8e95-d649687a2473 Date: 1993 Google Scholar ) or with code written in-house.
The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone of the protein with respect to first frame of the trajectory along the simulation time has been calculated by least-square fitting the structure to the reference structure (t2 = 0) and subsequently calculating the RMSD R ⁢ M ⁢ S ⁢ D ⁡ ( t ⁢ 1 , t ⁢ 2 ) = √ [ 1 𝑀 ⁢ ∑ 𝑁 𝑖 = 1 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁡ ‖ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ⁢ 1 ) − 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ⁢ 2 ) ‖ ⁢ 2 ] where 𝑀 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖 = 1 𝑚 𝑖 and r i (t) is the position of atom I at time t .
The RMSF which is a measure of the displacement of each residue averaged over the number of atoms considered, has been calculated relative to the average structure, in the equilibrated part of the simulation.
In order to identify genes differentially expressed between WT CP versus GATA4-KO or TBX5 CPs (n = 5); siControl versus siGATA4 CPs (n = 3) and siControl.2 versus si GLYR1 CPs (n = 2), the analyses start with raw reads/sequences in FASTQ format. Trimming of known adapters and low-quality regions of reads was performed using Fastq-mcf ( Aronesty 2013 5. Aronesty, E. Comparison of Sequencing Utility Programs The Open Bioinformatics Journal. 2013; 7 :1-8 Crossref Scopus (722) Google Scholar ). Sequence quality control was assessed using the program FastQC ( Andrews 2007 3. Andrews, S. A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data babraham bioinformatics. 2007; Google Scholar ) and rSeQC ( Wang et al., 2012 124. Wang, L. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ Li, W. RSeQC: quality control of RNA-seq experiments Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :2184-2185 Crossref Scopus (1107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignment of the provided samples to the reference genome was performed using STAR 2.5.2a ( Dobin et al., 2013 29. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (17570) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads were aligned to the human hg19 reference assembly indicated in the header of the differential expression file. Reads were assigned to genes using featureCounts ( Liao et al., 2014 71. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (7989) PubMed Google Scholar ), part of the Subread suite ( http://subread.sourceforge.net/ ). Gene-level counts were arrived at using Ensembl gene annotation, in GTF format. Differential expression was assessed using edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 106. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (19590) PubMed Google Scholar ), an R package available through Bioconductor. Genes where there were not at least two samples with at least 5 (raw) reads were filtered out from further analyses. The reads counts of remaining ones are normalized for sample-to-sample variation using calcNormFactors in edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 106. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (19590) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mean gene expression was modeled as a function of siRNA status (siRNA treatment versus scramble control) and sample id. Genes whose expression is associated with siRNA status were determined by the likelihood ratio test ( Smyth 1996 112. Smyth, G.K. A conditional approach to residual maximum likelihood estimation in generalized linear models R. Stat. Soc. B., 1996 Crossref Google Scholar ; Robinson and Smyth 2007 104. Robinson, M.D. ∙ Smyth, G.K. Moderated statistical tests for assessing differences in tag abundance Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :2881-2887 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robinson and Smyth 2008 105. Robinson, M.D. ∙ Smyth, G.K. Small-sample estimation of negative binomial dispersion, with applications to SAGE data Biostatistics. 2008; 9 :321-332 Crossref Scopus (673) PubMed Google Scholar ) implemented in edgeR using a FDR < 0.05 and LogFC < −0.25 threshold.
Functional enrichment gene-set analysis for GO (Gene Ontology) terms was performed using ToppGene Suite ( https://toppgene.cchmc.org/enrichment.jsp ) using all Homo sapiens genes as background. Statistically significant (Bonferroni q-value < 0.05) categories within the GO:Biological Process section were extracted and replotted.
For the ChIPseq analysis, trimming of known adapters and low-quality regions of reads was performed using Fastq-mcf. Sequence quality control was assessed using FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ). Alignment to the hg19 reference genome was performed using Bowtie 2.2.4 ( Langmead and Salzberg 2012 67. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (24558) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peaks were called using GEM ( Guo et al., 2012 46. Guo, Y. ∙ Mahony, S. ∙ Gifford, D.K. High resolution genome wide binding event finding and motif discovery reveals transcription factor spatial binding constraints PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8 :e1002638 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ) for TFs and BCP ( Xing et al., 2012 128. Xing, H. ∙ Mo, Y. ∙ Liao, W. ... Genome-wide localization of protein-DNA binding and histone modification by a Bayesian change-point method with ChIP-seq data PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8 :e1002613 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) for GLYR1 and H3K36me3 ChIPseq signals. Read counts per peak were generated with featureCounts ( Liao et al., 2014 71. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (7989) PubMed Google Scholar ) and normalized to account for differences in sequencing depth between samples using upper quartile normalization separately for the ChIP and input sample. Bound regions were determined using empirical Bayes F-tests for a quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model of the count data as implemented in edgeR. Specifically, we tested for a significant (i.e., non-zero at FDR < 5%) log2 fold-increase in normalized peak signal for ChIP versus the corresponding input sample. 2 or 3 separate samples (and relative inputs) were ran from independent ChIP assays.
GATA4 and GLYR1 ChIP-seq genomic features ( Figure S5 E ). We obtained the genomic features associated with GATA4 and GLYR1 ChIP-seq peaks using the annotatr ( Cavalcante and Sartor 2017 20. Cavalcante, R.G. ∙ Sartor, M.A. annotatr: genomic regions in context Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2381-2383 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ) package in R.
Metagene plot analysis ( Figure S 5D, S5J, and 6 D ). To generate metagene plots, BED files were generated containing regions of interest. The computeMatrix scale-regions module of deepTools ( Ramírez et al., 2016 99. Ramírez, F. ∙ Ryan, D.P. ∙ Grüning, B. ... deepTools2: a next generation web server for deep-sequencing data analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W160-5 Crossref Scopus (1768) PubMed Google Scholar ), which shrinks or stretches all regions in the input BED file to the same length was used to summarize the ChIP signal profile for each region. The ChIP signal was defined in terms of input subtracted tag densities. Specifically, the human genome, hg19 is divided into 20-bp bins. The tag density or normalized difference between the number of the reads in the ChIP sample and the input sample is computed as: # 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝐺 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 × ( # 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ R e ⁡ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 # 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ R e ⁡ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 − # 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ R e ⁡ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 # 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ R e ⁡ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 )
Analysis of differential ChIP-seq signal. The counts of reads mapping to genes for each of the replicates for each of the ChIPs (GLYR1 and H3K36me3) at the hiPSC and CPC stages under wild-type conditions and at the CPC stage under P496L mutant conditions were obtained using featureCounts ( Liao et al., 2014 71. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (7989) PubMed Google Scholar ) using their corresponding aligned reads in bam files. The counts of reads for each of replicates used for assaying gene expression at the two stages in the GSE137920 ( Lau et al., 2019 68. Lau, E. ∙ Han, Y. ∙ Williams, D.R. ... Splice-Junction-Based Mapping of Alternative Isoforms in the Human Proteome Cell Rep. 2019; 29 :3751-3765.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) dataset were downloaded from GEO ( Barrett et al., 2013 6. Barrett, T. ∙ Wilhite, S.E. ∙ Ledoux, P. ... NCBI GEO: archive for functional genomics data sets--update Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D991-D995 Crossref Scopus (4723) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes where there were not at least two samples with at least 5 (raw) reads in the GLYR1 ChIPs were filtered out from further analyses. The read counts for the remaining genes corresponding to each of the three signals (GLYR1, H3K36m3 and Gene expression) are separately normalized using calcNormFactors in edgeR ( Robinson and Oshlack 2010 103. Robinson, M.D. ∙ Oshlack, A. A scaling normalization method for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data Genome Biol. 2010; 11 :R25 Crossref Scopus (3916) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes for which the mean GLYR1 signal in their bodies were significantly changed from CPC stage relative to hiPSC stage (or in the P496L mutant versus wild-type conditions) were determined the likelihood ratio test implemented in edgeR using FDR < 0.1 threshold. The row-normalized log2 transformed Counts-Per-Million (CPM) of GLYR1 signal for these significantly associated (with changing GLYR1 signal) genes were clustered using kmeans with 3 clusters implemented in R ( R Core Team 2020 96. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2020 Google Scholar ). The resulting cluster definitions (using the GLYR1 signal) and order of genes were used to visualize the signals (in row-normalized log2 CPM units) in the H3K36me3 and RNA-seq data.
Definition of GATA4 and GLYR1-bound gene categories (list used in most of the panel Figure 6 ). GLYR1 bound genes in Figure 6 B are defined as those genes in clusters 2 and 3 in Figure 6 A which displayed enriched binding signal at the CPC stage relative to the hiPSC stage. Genes with Gata4 ChIP peaks from the first intron to Transcription End Site (TES) were defined as Gata4 bound genes.
Scatterplot analysis (ChIP-seq/RNA-seq) ( Figure S5 A ). Differential gene expression between the hiPSC (day 0) and the CPC stage (day 7) was determined using quasi-likelihood F-test implemented in the glmQLFTest in edgeR ( Lun et al., 2016 73. Lun, A.T.L. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. It’s DE-licious: A Recipe for Differential Expression Analyses of RNA-seq Experiments Using Quasi-Likelihood Methods in edgeR Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1418 :391-416 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the count matrix association with the GSE137920 ( Lau et al., 2019 68. Lau, E. ∙ Han, Y. ∙ Williams, D.R. ... Splice-Junction-Based Mapping of Alternative Isoforms in the Human Proteome Cell Rep. 2019; 29 :3751-3765.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) filtered for low counts (at least two samples with at least 5 (raw) reads) genes normalized using the calcNormFactors . Upregulated genes were determined using thresholds of 1.5 for log2 fold-change (log2FC > 1.5) and 0.05 for FDR (FDR < 0.05), while downregulated genes were determined using thresholds of −1.5 for log2 fold-change (log2FC < −1.5) and 0.05 for FDR. The raw read counts for all replicates of GLYR1 at the two stages for all genes that were part of the differential gene expression analyses above, were normalized using calcNormFactors and Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM) was calculated using the rpkm function along with the gene lengths based on the Ensembl gene annotation. Similarly, RPKM values were estimated for all replicates of the H3K36me3 ChIP at the two stages. The scatterplots in Figure S5 use the mean log2-transformed RPKM values across replicates at a given stage.
Statistical analysis of GATA4 and GLYR1 ChIP-seq overlap ( Figure 6 B). The significance of the overlap of genes bound within their bodies (first intron to Transcription End Site (TES)) by Gata4 and GLYR1 was determined using the Fisher’s exact test implemented in R ( R Core Team 2020 96. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2020 Google Scholar ) on 30,611 genes which had detectable reads (5 reads in at least two samples) at the day 7 in the GSE137920 ( Lau et al., 2019 68. Lau, E. ∙ Han, Y. ∙ Williams, D.R. ... Splice-Junction-Based Mapping of Alternative Isoforms in the Human Proteome Cell Rep. 2019; 29 :3751-3765.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) dataset.
Motif analyses. Motif enrichment in the ChIP peak regions were performed using the findMotifsGenome function implemented in homer (version v4.11.1) ( Heinz et al., 2010 48. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6049) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Preprocessing. 6-8 replicate samples (from independent differentiation runs involving either wild-type or P496L mutant cells) were each processed in 3 batches. Reads from each sample were aligned to the hg38 human reference (version 2020-A from 10X Genomics website) using Cell Ranger version 5.0.1. The resulting count matrices for all samples within each batch were aggregated without depth normalization. The aggregated matrix was analyzed with the Seurat package (version 4.0.1) in R ( Hao et al., 2021 47. Hao, Y. ∙ Hao, S. ∙ Andersen-Nissen, E. ... Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data Cell. 2021; 184 :3573-3587.e29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (800) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Seurat object was created keeping cells with the number of detected features between 30 th and 95 th quantiles of detected features across all cells in the batch and whose percent mitochondrial reads were below 30%. The remaining counts were normalized with the SCTranform function after setting the number of variable features to 3000, using the glmGamPoi method to estimate parameters of the fitted negative binomial distributions and regressing out the effects of the percent mitochondrial reads per cell. The SCTranform based normalized counts per sample were subject to correction for systematic differences between the three batches using the RunHarmony function as implemented in the harmony ( Korsunsky et al., 2019 64. Korsunsky, I. ∙ Millard, N. ∙ Fan, J. ... Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1289-1296 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ) R package. Clustering was done using a shared nearest neighbor graph built with the top 30 dimensions of the harmony-based correction and the original Louvain algorithm for modularity optimization with resolution parameter set to 0.4. UMAP embedding was then generated using the top 30 dimensions of the harmony-based correction.
Association with cell state. The differences in the proportion of P496L mutant cells versus WT cells in each of the identified cell clusters at each of the sampled time-points in the differentiation protocol was quantified using an odds ratio estimate. The log odds ratios were estimated in the context of a generalized linear mixed effects model assuming the binomial family of probability distribution for the numbers of cells, as implemented in the glmer function in the lme4 ( Bates et al., 2015 10. Bates, D. ∙ Mächler, M. ∙ Bolker, B. ... Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 J. Stat. Softw. 2015; 67 :1-48 Crossref Scopus (36021) Google Scholar ) package in R. The sample or differentiation run of origin of each cell was modeled as a random effect in these models.
Differential expression. The association of gene expression with differences between wild-type and mutant cells were estimated using the FindMarkers function in Seurat ( Hao et al., 2021 47. Hao, Y. ∙ Hao, S. ∙ Andersen-Nissen, E. ... Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data Cell. 2021; 184 :3573-3587.e29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (800) PubMed Google Scholar ) that implemented the MAST ( Finak et al., 2015 36. Finak, G. ∙ McDavid, A. ∙ Yajima, M. ... MAST: a flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing data Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :278 Crossref Scopus (870) PubMed Google Scholar ) method where the batch of the origin of each cell was modeled as a latent variable.
Association with ChIP-seq data. The differences between the average (across replicates from independent differentiation runs) ChIP signal (quantified in Transcripts-Per-Million (TPM) units) within gene bodies among the wild-type cells and the P496L cells were visualized as scatterplots separately for genes that were upregulated (logFC > 0.125 and FDR < 0.05 in the output of the FindMarkers function) and downregulated (logFC < −0.125 and FDR < 0.05).
Statistical parameters including the exact value of n, precision measures (mean ± SEM) and statistical significance are reported in the Figures and the Figure Legends. All calculations were performed using R or GraphPad Prism software. When several conditions were to compare, we performed a one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey range test to assess the significance among pairs of conditions. The significance of the PPIN enrichment in CHD-associated DNVs was calculated with a permutation-based test as explained in the Computational Analysis Methods section. All the p values related to the violin plots showing features typical of disease genes were obtained using a two-sided Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction. The significance of the GATA4 & GLYR1 ChIPseq overlap was estimated using the Fisher.Exact function in R. The level of significance in all graphs is represented as follow: ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
