Title: A prion-like protein regulator of seed germination undergoes hydration-dependent phase separation


Abstract: Summary

Many organisms evolved strategies to survive desiccation. Plant seeds protect dehydrated embryos from various stressors and can lay dormant for millennia. Hydration is the key trigger to initiate germination, but the mechanism by which seeds sense water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates upon hydration and allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that biophysical states of FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo in suppressing seed germination under unfavorable environments. We find intragenic, intraspecific, and interspecific natural variation in FLOE1 expression and phase separation and show that intragenic variation is associated with adaptive germination strategies in natural populations. This combination of molecular, organismal, and ecological studies uncovers FLOE1 as a tunable environmental sensor with direct implications for the design of drought-resistant crops, in the face of climate change.

Section: Introduction

Although water is essential for life, numerous organisms developed ways to withstand severe water stress or have quiescent desiccated life stages ( Boothby and Pielak, 2017 16.

Among the organisms that have come up with such extreme adaptation are the seed plants. Seeds are specialized propagation vectors that can mature to a quiescent, desiccated state, allowing them to remain viable in harsh conditions anywhere from a few years to millennia ( Sallon et al., 2020 76.

They can survive extreme desiccation by accumulating protective molecules that profoundly change their cellular biophysical properties ( Buitink and Leprince, 2008 19. Buitink, J. ∙ Leprince, O.

Upon water uptake, called imbibition, seeds undergo a cascade of biochemical and mechanical events and resume cellular activities ( Nonogaki et al., 2018 65. Nonogaki, H. ∙ Chen, F. ∙ Bradford, K.J.

Seed germination and vigor Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2012; 63 :507-533 Crossref Scopus (877) PubMed Google Scholar ). Seeds can endure multiple hydration-dehydration cycles while remaining viable and desiccation tolerant ( Bai et al., 2012 7. Bai, B. ∙ Sikron, N. ∙ Gendler, T. ... Ecotypic variability in the metabolic response of seeds to diurnal hydration-dehydration cycles and its relationship to seed vigor Plant Cell Physiol. 2012; 53 :38-52 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, once committed to germination, seeds lose this ability ( Rajjou et al., 2012 70. Rajjou, L. ∙ Duval, M. ∙ Gallardo, K. ... Seed germination and vigor Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2012; 63 :507-533 Crossref Scopus (877) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, poor timing of germination can severely limit seedling survival ( Kranner et al., 2010 46. Kranner, I. ∙ Minibayeva, F.V. ∙ Beckett, R.P. ... What is stress? Concepts, definitions and applications in seed science New Phytol. 2010; 188 :655-673 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the fundamental importance of germination control, the molecular details that underpin this decision remain elusive.
Limited water availability dramatically alters protein solubility and induces protein aggregation. To protect their cytoplasmic components, seeds have an arsenal of protective mechanisms. These include the upregulation of osmoprotectants ( ElSayed et al., 2014 26. ElSayed, A.I. ∙ Rafudeen, M.S. ∙ Golldack, D. Physiological aspects of raffinose family oligosaccharides in plants: protection against abiotic stress Plant Biol (Stuttg). 2014; 16 :1-8 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) and chaperones, and a cytoplasmic liquid-to-glass transition during seed maturation ( Buitink and Leprince, 2008 19. Buitink, J. ∙ Leprince, O. Intracellular glasses and seed survival in the dry state C. R. Biol. 2008; 331 :788-795 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Leprince and Buitink, 2015 50. Leprince, O. ∙ Buitink, J. Introduction to desiccation biology: from old borders to new frontiers Planta. 2015; 242 :369-378 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the complex biophysical changes proteins must endure under such extreme conditions, we investigated how seed proteins might have adapted to deal with them. We used transcriptomic data to identify the Arabidopsis thaliana seed-enriched proteome. Interestingly, we found an enrichment for protein disorder, among which were several prion-like proteins. These types of proteins have been previously connected to protein phase separation, a physical process that allows cells to compartmentalize biomolecules into membraneless biomolecular condensates ( Boeynaems et al., 2018 14.

Phase separation of Arabidopsis EMB1579 controls transcription, mRNA splicing, and development PLoS Biol. 2020; 18 :e3000782 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), it remains unclear how phase separation could play a role in seeds, especially given the challenges regarding protein aggregation under water-limiting conditions.
Here, we report the identification of an uncharacterized prion-like protein, FLOE1, which specifically phase separates upon seed imbibition. Through phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses of mutant lines, we provide evidence that the protein allows the embryo to sense water potential and attenuates germination under unfavorable conditions. FLOE1 undergoes phase separation and functions to regulate germination under conditions of water stress. We dissected the molecular grammar of FLOE1 and created a set of mutants that span the material state spectrum. Using these to change FLOE1’s biophysical state resulted in altered seed germination, providing evidence for the functional importance of a biomolecular condensate’s material properties in vivo in a multicellular organism. Finally, we uncovered a vast family of FLOE homologs across green plants. We show that natural sequence variation drives differences in FLOE phase behavior suggesting that FLOE variation might regulate seed germination in the wild.

Section: Results

To find seed-enriched proteins, we re-analyzed publicly available A. thaliana transcriptomics data and found 449 protein-coding genes that are expressed at higher levels in dry seeds compared to other tissues ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ) ( Austin et al., 2016 6. Austin, R.S. ∙ Hiu, S. ∙ Waese, J. ... New BAR tools for mining expression data and exploring Cis-elements in Arabidopsis thaliana Plant J. 2016; 88 :490-504 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmid et al., 2005 80. Schmid, M. ∙ Davison, T.S. ∙ Henz, S.R. ... A gene expression map of Arabidopsis thaliana development Nat. Genet. 2005; 37 :501-506 Crossref Scopus (2030) PubMed Google Scholar ). These proteins had a different amino acid compositional profile ( Figure 1 B) and were enriched for regions of structural disorder compared to the rest of the proteome ( Figure 1 C). Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have emerged as key players in cell biology that, among many roles, orchestrate how cells organize themselves and their contingent biochemical reactions into discrete membraneless compartments by a process called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) ( Boeynaems et al., 2018 14. Boeynaems, S. ∙ Alberti, S. ∙ Fawzi, N.L. ... Protein Phase Separation: A New Phase in Cell Biology Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :420-435 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1259) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 82. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2168) PubMed Google Scholar ). A subset of IDPs harbors a class of domains known as prion-like domains (PrLD), and we identified 14 proteins with PrLDs in the seed-enriched proteins ( Figure 1 D). PrLDs were first identified in fungal prions and later shown to drive reversible protein phase separation in diverse eukaryotic species ( Alberti et al., 2009 4. Alberti, S. ∙ Halfmann, R. ∙ King, O. ... A systematic survey identifies prions and illuminates sequence features of prionogenic proteins Cell. 2009; 137 :146-158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (795) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 82. Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2168) PubMed Google Scholar ). In yeast, PrLDs give rise to phenotypic diversity via a proposed bet-hedging strategy to help cope with a fluctuating environment ( Halfmann et al., 2012 36. Halfmann, R. ∙ Jarosz, D.F. ∙ Jones, S.K. ... Prions are a common mechanism for phenotypic inheritance in wild yeasts Nature. 2012; 482 :363-368 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). All but one of these PrLD-containing seed-enriched proteins had annotated functions or domains related to nucleic acid metabolism. The one that did not, AT4G28300, was an uncharacterized plant-specific protein, which we named FLOE1, inspired by the second movement of Glassworks by Philip Glass as well as the definition of floe being “a sheet of floating ice,” which is a phase-separated body of water.
FLOE1 accumulates during embryo development, and its expression peaks in the mature desiccated state ( Figures S1 A and S1B). We generated transgenic A. thaliana lines expressing FLOE1 ’s genomic region—from its predicted promoter to its last coding codon—fused to GFP . FLOE1 formed cytoplasmic condensates during embryonic development ( Figure 1 E; Figure S1 C) and in embryos dissected in water from dry seeds ( Figure 1 F; Figure S1 D). However, when we dissected dry seeds in glycerin instead of water (to mimic the desiccated environment), FLOE1 did not form condensates and was diffusely localized ( Figure 1 F; Figures S1 E). Developing embryos prior to desiccation showed FLOE1 condensates even when dissected in glycerin ( Figure S1 F). When we transferred the mature, dry embryos from glycerin to water, FLOE1 condensates spontaneously appeared ( Figure 1 F) and were fully reversible with repeated hydration-dehydration cycles ( Figure 1 F; Figure S1 K). Pre-treating seeds with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide did not affect the formation of FLOE1 condensates, indicating that they are distinct from stress granules and processing bodies ( Gutierrez-Beltran et al., 2015 35. Gutierrez-Beltran, E. ∙ Moschou, P.N. ∙ Smertenko, A.P. ... Tudor staphylococcal nuclease links formation of stress granules and processing bodies with mRNA catabolism in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2015; 27 :926-943 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ), and that their emergence did not depend on FLOE1 translation upon imbibition ( Figure S1 G). In line with this, FLOE1 condensates appeared rapidly upon hydration (in less than a minute), arguing against the involvement of biosynthetic processes and for a rapid biophysical response to water. To directly test whether FLOE1 forms condensates in response to changes in water potential, we dissected embryos in solutions of varying concentrations of salt, mannitol, or sorbitol ( Figures 1 G–1I; Figures S1 H and S1I). High concentrations of salt resembled dry conditions—embryos lacked visible FLOE1 condensates ( Figures 1 G–1I). Lowering the salt concentration resulted in a gradual emergence of condensates, which was highly variable at the cell-to-cell ( Figures 1 G and 1H) and tissue levels ( Figure 1 I). In intermediate concentrations, we observed a small number of cells with apparent nuclear localization of FLOE1 ( Figure 1 J; Figure S1 J), suggesting this could be a behavior associated with early steps of imbibition, before the majority of the protein condenses in the cytoplasm. Like our observations with repeated hydration-dehydration cycles, FLOE1 condensation was also reversible by moving seeds back and forth between solutions of high or no salt ( Figure 1 K; Figure S1 K). Thus, FLOE1 forms cytoplasmic condensates in response to changes in water potential in vivo and these are fully reversible ( Figure 1 L).
We next asked whether FLOE1 functions in germination. Lines carrying the knockout allele floe1-1 did not show any obvious developmental defects, and floe1-1 seeds had the same size, shape, and weight as wild-type seeds ( Figure S2 A). floe1-1 seeds germinated indistinguishably from wild-type seeds under standard conditions ( Figure S2 B) but, intriguingly, had higher germination levels under conditions of water deprivation induced by salt ( Figure 2 A; Figure S2 C) or mannitol ( Figure S2 C). We confirmed that these phenotypes were caused by mutations in FLOE1 using independent lines carrying CRISPR-Cas9 deletion alleles and floe1-1 lines complemented with the wild-type allele ( Figures S2 C–S2F). Germination during stressful environmental conditions is risky for a plant and can reduce fitness. Indeed, both wild-type and floe1-1 seedlings displayed developmental defects or eventually died under these conditions ( Figure S2 G), whereas ungerminated seeds retained their full germination potential upon stress alleviation ( Figure 2 B), in line with bet-hedging strategies utilized by stressed seeds ( Gremer and Venable, 2014 34. Gremer, J.R. ∙ Venable, D.L. Bet hedging in desert winter annual plants: optimal germination strategies in a variable environment Ecol. Lett. 2014; 17 :380-387 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ; Johnston and Bassel, 2018 40. Johnston, I.G. ∙ Bassel, G.W. Identification of a bet-hedging network motif generating noise in hormone concentrations and germination propensity in Arabidopsis J. R. Soc. Interface. 2018; 15 :20180042 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Villa Martín et al., 2019 89. Villa Martín, P. ∙ Muñoz, M.A. ∙ Pigolotti, S. Bet-hedging strategies in expanding populations PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15 :e1006529 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). To define the role of FLOE1 condensates in stress-mediated attenuation of germination, we first asked whether the condensates would reform upon stress alleviation. Whereas ungerminated salt-stressed seeds were largely devoid of FLOE1 condensates, even after 15 days of incubation, alleviating salt stress robustly induced their appearance ( Figure 2 C; Figure S2 H). Moreover, the extent of FLOE1 phase separation correlated with germination levels ( Figure S3 ). Importantly, in contrast to the hydration experiments we performed on naked embryos by submersion ( Figures 1 F–1K), we performed these experiments by incubating intact seeds on agar plates with the indicated salt concentrations—representing more physiologically relevant conditions ( Figure S3 D). These results show that FLOE1 phase separates in vivo and that this event coincides with the onset of germination. Moreover, under water limitation, FLOE1 attenuates germination, thereby enabling a better chance of survival ( Figure 2 D).
To place FLOE1’s role in the context of other germination pathways, we performed transcriptomics on wild-type and floe1-1 plants. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis suggests that FLOE1 functions upstream of key germination pathways. floe1-1 seeds had only few changes in gene expression compared to wild-type seeds in both their desiccated state and under normal imbibition. But under salt stress, loss of FLOE1 caused a significant change in the transcriptome ( Figure 2 E). In line with the observation that floe1-1 seeds germinate more readily under water stress, their salt stress-responsive transcriptome was marked by an upregulation of metabolic genes, consistent with promoting germination, and stress-response genes, as the seeds exit their stress-tolerant desiccated state ( Figure 2 F; Figure S2 I; Table S2 ). Interestingly, floe1-1 seeds showed relatively lower transcript levels of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis compared to wild-type seeds under salt stress ( Figure 2 F; Figure S2 I). We attribute the apparent downregulation of these housekeeping genes in floe1-1 seeds under salt stress to the initiation of gene expression upon germination. Finally, since the ratio of the phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) is a major regulator of germination under unfavorable conditions, including salinity ( Shu et al., 2017 83. Shu, K. ∙ Qi, Y. ∙ Chen, F. ... Salt Stress Represses Soybean Seed Germination by Negatively Regulating GA Biosynthesis While Positively Mediating ABA Biosynthesis Front. Plant Sci. 2017; 8 :1372 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ), we explored whether FLOE1 is involved in this hormonal regulation. Disruption of the ABA/GA balance through supplementation of ABA or inhibition of GA synthesis did not induce any germination differences between floe1-1 and wild-type seeds ( Figures S2 J and S2K). Together, these results suggest that FLOE1 regulates germination through a distinct process that involves the direct sensing of water potential.
Numerous yeast proteins undergo oligomerization or phase separation upon stress-induced quiescence ( Munder et al., 2016 62. Munder, M.C. ∙ Midtvedt, D. ∙ Franzmann, T. ... A pH-driven transition of the cytoplasm from a fluid- to a solid-like state promotes entry into dormancy eLife. 2016; 5 :e09347 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ), but FLOE1 undergoes biomolecular condensation upon release from the quiescent state. To define the mechanism by which FLOE1 undergoes this switch, we dissected the molecular grammar underlying this behavior. We first expressed and purified maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged FLOE1 protein from E. coli to determine whether it can undergo phase separation in isolation. Upon cleavage of the MBP tag, FLOE1 spontaneously demixed to form droplets ( Figure 3 A; Figures S4 A and S4B) that enriched FLOE1 but excluded MBP ( Figure S4 C), similar to the behavior of other phase-separating proteins ( Burke et al., 2015 20. Burke, K.A. ∙ Janke, A.M. ∙ Rhine, C.L. ... Residue-by-Residue View of In Vitro FUS Granules that Bind the C-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II Mol. Cell. 2015; 60 :231-241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether FLOE1 can phase separate in the range of physiological protein concentrations, we set out to estimate the local protein concentration of FLOE1 in vivo and performed dilution series in vitro . By calculating the volume of the cytoplasmic fraction of A. thaliana embryos (see STAR Methods ), we found that FLOE1’s in vivo concentration is within the same range it can phase separate in vitro ( Figure S4 D; Figures S5 A–S5H; Video S1 ; Table S3 ). Because FLOE1 can phase separate in isolation, we next defined which protein domains drive phase separation. FLOE1 harbors a predicted coiled-coil domain and a conserved plant-specific domain of unknown function (DUF1421) ( Figure 3 B). Disorder prediction algorithms identified another predicted folded region and two different disordered regions, one enriched for aspartic acid and serine (DS-rich) and the other enriched for glutamine, proline, and serine (QPS-rich). We heterologously expressed FLOE1 in two orthogonal systems, tobacco leaves ( Figure 3 C; Figures S1 L–S1M; Video S2 ) and the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS ( Figure 3 D). In these two systems, like in A. thaliana ( Figure 1 ), FLOE1 formed spherical condensates, providing independent platforms for interrogating the molecular drivers of condensation. We deleted each domain of FLOE1 and assayed the impact on cytoplasmic condensation ( Figures 3 C–3E). In both tobacco and human cells, mutants lacking either the short coiled-coil domain or DUF1421 behaved identically to the wild-type protein ( Figures 3 C–3E). In contrast, deletion of the other domains altered FLOE1 condensation ( Figures 3 C–3E). Deletion of the predicted folded domain, which we refer to as the nucleation domain, abolished cytoplasmic condensation, resulting in a fraction of the protein redistributing to the nucleus. Folded oligomerization domains play important roles in nucleating phase separation of several IDPs ( Boeynaems et al., 2018 14. Boeynaems, S. ∙ Alberti, S. ∙ Fawzi, N.L. ... Protein Phase Separation: A New Phase in Cell Biology Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :420-435 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1259) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, expression of chimeric fusion proteins revealed that this domain is sufficient to nucleate phase separation of the FLOE1 PrLD (i.e., QPS) and the PrLD derived from the human FUS protein, which has been extensively studied for its phase separation behavior ( Patel et al., 2015 66. Patel, A. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Jawerth, L. ... A Liquid-to-Solid Phase Transition of the ALS Protein FUS Accelerated by Disease Mutation Cell. 2015; 162 :1066-1077 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1868) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A). All-atom simulations and homology-based modeling suggest that the nucleation domain adopts a trimeric coiled-coil conformation ( Figure S4 E), providing the multivalent interactions required for nucleating protein phase separation.

In line with their role in driving phase separation of other prion-like proteins, deletion of the QPS PrLD reduced condensate formation in cells ( Figures 3 C–3E) and in the test tube ( Figure S4 F). Consistent with the emerging sticker-spacer framework for PrLDs ( Martin et al., 2020 54. Martin, E.W. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Peran, I. ... Valence and patterning of aromatic residues determine the phase behavior of prion-like domains Science. 2020; 367 :694-699 Crossref Scopus (518) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2018 93. Wang, J. ∙ Choi, J.M. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ... A Molecular Grammar Governing the Driving Forces for Phase Separation of Prion-like RNA Binding Proteins Cell. 2018; 174 :688-699.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1114) PubMed Google Scholar ), the QPS PrLD has regularly spaced aromatic tyrosine residues along its sequence that may act as attractive stickers. Substituting tyrosine residues for serines (Y-S) decreased condensate formation in both human and tobacco cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4 B; Table S3 ). By mapping out a phase diagram ( Figure 4 C) and probing the molecular dynamics using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( Figure 4 D) of Y-S and S-Y mutants, we confirmed that the number of tyrosines determines both the saturation and gelation concentrations of FLOE1 condensates, consistent with what has been shown for other PrLDs ( Martin et al., 2020 54. Martin, E.W. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Peran, I. ... Valence and patterning of aromatic residues determine the phase behavior of prion-like domains Science. 2020; 367 :694-699 Crossref Scopus (518) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings provide further evidence that FLOE1 condensates form via LLPS, and increasing its multivalency drives gelation into more solid-like irregular assemblies. While changing the number of stickers can drive a liquid-to-gel transition, altering sticker strength may also alter the gelation concentration. Substituting tyrosines for weaker (phenylalanine) or stronger (tryptophan) aromatic residues affected both condensate morphology and intracondensate dynamics in a predictable manner, in which increasing the stickiness of the QPS PrLD induced gelation of FLOE1 ( Figures 4 E and 4F; Table S3 ).
Surprisingly, removing the N-terminal DS domain also induced FLOE1 gelation ( Figures 3 C–3E; Figure 4 G). Serine substitution of aromatic residues in the DS domain had a similar effect as DS deletion ( Figure 4 G), suggesting that the aromatic residues in the DS and QPS domains have opposing functions. Intriguingly, electron microscopy revealed that the gel-like condensates formed via DS-8xYF-S (8 tyrosine and phenylalanine residues changed to serine in the DS region) had a regular striated substructure and were strikingly distinct from the homogeneous wild-type condensates ( Figure 4 H; Figures S5 I–S5M; Video S3 ), consistent with their reduced dynamics and change in morphology ( Figures 4 I–4J). This striated substructure is reminiscent of synaptonemal complexes that have also been proposed to form through phase separation of a coiled-coil protein ( Rog et al., 2017 75. Rog, O. ∙ Köhler, S. ∙ Dernburg, A.F. The synaptonemal complex has liquid crystalline properties and spatially regulates meiotic recombination factors eLife. 2017; 6 :e21455 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, synergistic and opposing molecular forces tightly regulate FLOE1’s biophysical phase behavior, and changing this balance allows its properties to be experimentally toggled between dilute, liquid droplet, and solid gel states ( Figure 4 K).

To directly test whether FLOE1’s role in seed germination is a function of its biophysical state, we generated A. thaliana lines carrying wild-type or different FLOE1 domain deletion mutants in the null background ( Figures 5 A and 5B). These mutants behaved consistently in A. thaliana embryos as they did in human and tobacco cells ( Figures 3 C–3E). The ΔQPS mutant was unable to phase separate upon imbibition ( Figure 5 B), whereas the ΔDUF mutant formed condensates that were indistinguishable from the wild-type ( Figures 5 B–5D). In contrast, the ΔDS mutant formed condensates that were larger than those formed by the wild-type protein ( Figures 5 B–5D), consistent with what we observed in tobacco and human cells. The ΔDS mutant has lost its hydration dependency and seems to exist in a constitutively condensed state ( Figure 5 E). This is important because now we have a way to eliminate the reversibility of FLOE1 condensate formation. We assayed germination levels under salt stress and found that removing the DUF domain resulted in phenotypes that were indistinguishable from those of knockout lines complemented with wild-type FLOE1 ( Figure 5 F; Figures S6 A–S6D). However, removing the QPS domain resulted in phenotypes indistinguishable from those of knockout mutants ( Figure 5 F; Figures S6 A–S6D), suggesting that this domain is required for FLOE1 function. Surprisingly, removing the DS domain resulted in greatly enhanced germination levels under salt stress, surpassing even that of the null mutant, indicating that ΔDS likely functions as a gain-of-function mutation ( Figure 5 F; Figures S6 A–S6D). These data provide evidence that the reversibility of FLOE1 condensate formation is important for its function, but it remains possible that the ΔQPS and ΔDS mutations have additional effects on FLOE1 function independent of phase separation (see Discussion ).
Assaying the transcriptome of ΔDS seeds showed large changes in gene expression compared to wild-type complemented lines ( Figures S6 F and S6G; Table S2 ). In contrast to floe1-1 seeds, where gene-expression changes were limited to salt stress ( Figure 2 E), in ΔDS seeds, we observed significant changes in both dry and non-stress imbibition conditions ( Figures S6 F and S6G), suggesting the possibility of non-stress related phenotypes. Indeed, ΔDS seeds displayed faster germination rates under standard conditions ( Figure S6 E). These findings indicate that switching the material properties of a biomolecular condensate can have broad phenotypic effects that can impact organismal fitness in a variety of environmental conditions ( Figure 5 G).
To investigate the role of the material properties of FLOE1 in an ecological and evolutionary context, we first examined FLOE1’s intragenic variation in phase behavior and explored variation in expression level and seed dormancy across hundreds of A. thaliana ecotypes. FLOE1 encodes two isoforms from alternatively spliced transcripts ( Figure 6 A). Besides the full-length isoform (FLOE1.1), which is the dominant form in all ecotypes ( Figure S7 A), FLOE1 encodes a shorter splice isoform that lacks the majority of the DS domain ( Figure 6 A). This shorter isoform (FLOE1.2) forms larger condensates ( Figure 6 B; Figure S6 H) that can recruit the longer isoform ( Figure 6 C). We next asked whether this intragenic variation in material properties of FLOE1.1 and FLOE1.2, which, based on our mutant studies, are associated with attenuating and promoting germination, respectively, could tune germination in natural populations. To explore this question, we generated a set of floe1-1 lines complemented with different expression levels of FLOE1 and found that FLOE1 transgene expression inversely correlated with germination levels under salt stress ( Figure S2 D; Figures S6 B and S6C). This provided an opportunity to look for evidence for such a tuning mechanism in wild populations, and to see whether FLOE1 isoforms elicited differential effects in nature. We took advantage of publicly available transcriptomic data for a wide array of A. thaliana ecotypes ( 1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016 1. 1001 Genomes Consortium 1,135 Genomes Reveal the Global Pattern of Polymorphism in Arabidopsis thaliana Cell. 2016; 166 :481-491 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a final set of 478 ecotypes ( Table S4 ), and several published phenotypic studies ( Martínez-Berdeja et al., 2020 55. Martínez-Berdeja, A. ∙ Stitzer, M.C. ∙ Taylor, M.A. ... Functional variants of DOG1 control seed chilling responses and variation in seasonal life-history strategies in Arabidopsis thaliana Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :2526-2534 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ; Togninalli et al., 2020 85. Togninalli, M. ∙ Seren, Ü. ∙ Freudenthal, J.A. ... AraPheno and the AraGWAS Catalog 2020: a major database update including RNA-Seq and knockout mutation data for Arabidopsis thaliana Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :D1063-D1068 PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with our findings from manipulating gene-expression levels and FLOE1 mutants, seed dormancy across ecotypes was positively correlated with FLOE1.1 expression, but not with FLOE1.2 expression ( Figure S7 B). Since FLOE1.1 is the dominant isoform ( Figure S7 A), this observation is in line with our results showing that FLOE1 dose-dependently attenuates germination in lab strains ( Figure S2 D). By contrast, FLOE1.2 expression across ecotypes was strongly correlated with promoting germination, whereas this correlation was less pronounced for FLOE1.1 expression ( Figures S7 C–S7F). Given that FLOE1.2 seems to mimic the phase behavior of our ΔDS mutant, the increased germination levels coinciding with its increased expression are consistent with the gain-of-function phenotype of ΔDS seeds ( Figure 5 F; Figures S6 B and S6E). While these correlations corroborate our experimental data, they do not address whether the expression of FLOE1 isoforms is tuned to the specific ecological niche, and whether this variation could drive phenotypic adaptation in wild populations. To explore this question, we compared expression patterns of the isoforms across ecotypes with climate data from their respective GPS coordinates of collection. In accordance with the hypothesis that FLOE1 expression is tuned by local environmental conditions, its expression was correlated with precipitation and temperature ( Figures S7 G–S7L). Surprisingly, FLOE1.1 and FLOE1.2 expression was positively correlated with summer precipitation, while negatively correlated with temperature, indicating this dormancy/germination switch may be a mechanism more prevalent in colder regions of the distribution. Since bet-hedging strategies are often employed by organisms to cope with changing environments, we asked how expression of the isoforms behaved in the context of variability in precipitation by calculating the coefficient of variation of July rainfall at the geographic locations of origin for a time series from 1958 to 2017 ( Abatzoglou et al., 2018 2. Abatzoglou, J.T. ∙ Dobrowski, S.Z. ∙ Parks, S.A. ... TerraClimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance from 1958-2015 Sci. Data. 2018; 5 :170191 Crossref Scopus (1440) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, FLOE1.2 (putative promoter of germination) expression negatively correlated with the yearly variation in precipitation, whereas this was far less pronounced for FLOE1.1 (putative attenuator of germination) ( Figures S7 M and S7N), indicating that natural populations living in environments with unpredictable precipitation express lower levels of FLOE1.2 . This suggests that expressing FLOE1.2 to control germination/dormancy may not be an advantageous strategy for plants living in environments with unpredictable rainfall such as the Mediterranean basin, where temperature may be a more reliable cue to fine-tune dormancy, as shown by other studies of temperature sensing germination delayers ( Exposito-Alonso, 2020 28. Exposito-Alonso, M. Seasonal timing adaptation across the geographic range of Arabidopsis thaliana Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :9665-9667 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). In summary, natural variation in the DS domain between FLOE1 isoforms may fine-tune FLOE1 function in seed dormancy and germination across ecotypes for local adaptation.
Variation in the DS domain resides not only intragenically but also intergenically. The A. thaliana genome encodes two FLOE1 homologs, which we named FLOE2 (AT5G14540) and FLOE3 (AT3G01560). When expressed in tobacco cells, FLOE2 and FLOE3 also formed larger condensates compared to FLOE1.1 ( Figure 6 D; Figure S6 H). FLOE2 and FLOE3 have expanded DS regions with lower overall structural disorder, while their QPS domains were very similar to FLOE1’s ( Figure 6 E). To see whether FLOE2 and FLOE3 could recruit FLOE1.1 similar to FLOE1.2, we coexpressed them in tobacco. Surprisingly, coexpression of FLOE1 with FLOE2 or FLOE3 resulted in the formation of demixed condensates, illustrating immiscibility of FLOE1 with its homologs ( Figure 6 F; Figure S6 I). Such complex topologies are common among biomolecular condensates and have been linked to differences in surface tension or viscosity between the different phases ( Boeynaems et al., 2019 15. Boeynaems, S. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ∙ Weinhardt, V. ... Spontaneous driving forces give rise to protein-RNA condensates with coexisting phases and complex material properties Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :7889-7898 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ; Feric et al., 2016 30. Feric, M. ∙ Vaidya, N. ∙ Harmon, T.S. ... Coexisting Liquid Phases Underlie Nucleolar Subcompartments Cell. 2016; 165 :1686-1697 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the DS domain is a key tuner of FLOE1 material properties, we wondered how deletion of this domain would impact condensate mixing. Surprisingly, while FLOE1/ΔDS FLOE1 condensates showed weak ΔDS substructures, consistent with the more gel-like nature of this mutant, combining the ΔDS FLOE1 mutant with FLOE2 or FLOE3 condensates lead to complete condensate mixing ( Figure 6 F). Since the ΔDS FLOE1 mutant had such a pronounced phenotype compared to floe1-1 lines in promoting germination under salt stress, we hypothesize that the aberrant interaction of ΔDS FLOE1 with endogenous FLOE2/3 homologs may be in part driving its gain-of-function phenotype ( Figure 6 G).
To assess whether phase separation is conserved in the FLOE family, we explored the diversity of this protein family in nature. We found FLOE homologs in all green plant lineages, even in those preceding seed evolution ( Figures 7 A and 7B; Figure S6 J). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the emergence of two major clades, FLOE1-like and FLOE2-like. While the latter clade includes the algal lineage, the FLOE1-like clade is restricted to seed plants. Both clades show conserved variation in the length of the two disordered domains ( Figure 7 C). By testing a set of FLOE homologs across the plant kingdom, we find wide phenotypic variation in phase separation that involves differences in condensate sizes and nuclear localization ( Figure 7 D; Figure S6 K). These findings indicate the existence of a wealth of natural sequence variation that might give rise to these different behaviors. Given our observations linking the variation in FLOE1 isoforms and homologs in A. thaliana to phenotypic variation in both engineered and natural strains, this wide diversity of FLOE homologs with differential phase separation behaviors suggests the possibility that this gene family could be a driver of functional phenotypic variation across the plant lineage.

Section: Discussion

Phase separation is emerging as a universal mechanism to explain how cells compartmentalize biomolecules. Despite advances involving the widespread identification of novel biomolecular condensates and elucidating their underlying molecular grammar, many questions remain. Chief among these is whether protein phase separation is truly functional for cellular physiology or whether it is an unintended consequence of protein evolution ( Martin and Holehouse, 2020 53. Martin, E.W. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. Intrinsically disordered protein regions and phase separation: sequence determinants of assembly or lack thereof Emerg Top Life Sci. 2020; 4 :307-329 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent work in yeast shows that phase separation of prion-like and related proteins is important for their function ( Franzmann et al., 2018 31. Franzmann, T.M. ∙ Jahnel, M. ∙ Pozniakovsky, A. ... Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness Science. 2018; 359 :eaao5654 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ; Riback et al., 2017 73. Riback, J.A. ∙ Katanski, C.D. ∙ Kear-Scott, J.L. ... Stress-Triggered Phase Separation Is an Adaptive, Evolutionarily Tuned Response Cell. 2017; 168 :1028-1040.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (570) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that these protein domains may indeed have evolved to drive protein condensation. Interestingly, amyloid-based aggregation of the same prion-like proteins has also been shown to confer fitness advantages to yeast under certain environmental conditions ( Halfmann et al., 2012 36. Halfmann, R. ∙ Jarosz, D.F. ∙ Jones, S.K. ... Prions are a common mechanism for phenotypic inheritance in wild yeasts Nature. 2012; 482 :363-368 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation indicates that the material properties of biomolecular condensates may be important in regulating protein function. Yet, this picture is less clear for multicellular organisms, especially since aggregation of several of these phase separation-prone proteins is implicated in human disease ( King et al., 2012 44. King, O.D. ∙ Gitler, A.D. ∙ Shorter, J.

Scheckel, C. ∙ Aguzzi, A. Prions, prionoids and protein misfolding disorders Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19 :405-418 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). The question therefore still remains whether this process is truly functional in multicellular eukaryotes. Emerging evidence suggests the functionality of protein condensates in plants ( Chakrabortee et al., 2016 21. Chakrabortee, S. ∙ Kayatekin, C. ∙ Newby, G.A. ...

Bakthavachalu, B. ∙ Huelsmeier, J. ∙ Sudhakaran, I.P. ... RNP-Granule Assembly via Ataxin-2 Disordered Domains Is Required for Long-Term Memory and Neurodegeneration Neuron. 2018; 98 :754-766.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in vivo evidence for a functional role of the emergent properties of phase separation is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that conformational switches between liquid and solid-like states of FLOE1 can drive functional phenotypic variability via bet hedging in a multicellular organism, similar to the prion-based bet-hedging strategies described in yeast ( Halfmann et al., 2012 36. Halfmann, R. ∙ Jarosz, D.F. ∙ Jones, S.K. ... Prions are a common mechanism for phenotypic inheritance in wild yeasts Nature. 2012; 482 :363-368 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Seed germination follows a bet-hedging strategy by spreading the risk of potentially lethal conditions, such as drought, across different seasons or years ( Gremer and Venable, 2014 34. Gremer, J.R. ∙ Venable, D.L. Bet hedging in desert winter annual plants: optimal germination strategies in a variable environment Ecol. Lett. 2014; 17 :380-387 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ; Johnston and Bassel, 2018 40. Johnston, I.G. ∙ Bassel, G.W. Identification of a bet-hedging network motif generating noise in hormone concentrations and germination propensity in Arabidopsis J. R. Soc. Interface. 2018; 15 :20180042 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Villa Martín et al., 2019 89. Villa Martín, P. ∙ Muñoz, M.A. ∙ Pigolotti, S. Bet-hedging strategies in expanding populations PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15 :e1006529 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). While seeds withstand many stresses in their desiccated dormant state, seedlings are at the mercy of their environment and represent the most vulnerable stage in a plant’s life. Therefore, precise timing of germination is crucial for plant fitness. Seeds should germinate under conditions that ensure the highest chance of seedling survival, yet a trade-off is that if they wait too long, they may miss the window of good conditions, increase their risk to be eaten or buried too deeply, or ultimately exhaust their viability. Importantly, rainfall cue sensing that drives seed behavior remains largely unresolved, and poses not only an interesting biological problem but also an outstanding agricultural challenge of great societal importance ( Baskin and Baskin, 2004 10. Baskin, J. ∙ Baskin, C. A classification system for seed dormancy Seed Sci. Res. 2004; 14 :1-16 Crossref Google Scholar ; Johnston and Bassel, 2018 40. Johnston, I.G. ∙ Bassel, G.W. Identification of a bet-hedging network motif generating noise in hormone concentrations and germination propensity in Arabidopsis J. R. Soc. Interface. 2018; 15 :20180042 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify factors that could regulate seed timing and bet-hedging strategies, we investigated the seed-enriched proteome. These proteins were overrepresented for disorder and involved a set of prion-like proteins. Among them was an uncharacterized prion-like protein that we named FLOE1. Interestingly, FLOE1 formed reversible condensates in A. thaliana embryos that were hydration dependent. Seed desiccation presents a peculiar biological challenge to proteins as they have to switch between a completely desiccated state and a “wet” state that supports cellular biochemistry, all while preventing irreversible protein aggregation. FLOE1 undergoes hydration-dependent phase separation in plant seeds, and it is likely that similar processes occur in a wide variety of organisms with quiescent desiccated life stages, including human pathogens, nematodes, and fungal spores ( Boothby and Pielak, 2017 16. Boothby, T.C. ∙ Pielak, G.J.

Angiosperm Plant Desiccation Tolerance: Hints from Transcriptomics and Genome Sequencing Trends Plant Sci. 2017; 22 :705-717 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given that water uptake is the key initiating event for germination, seeds must have evolved a water sensor that allows them to measure water potential. By characterizing FLOE1 knockout and complemented lines, we provide evidence that FLOE1 attenuates germination under water-limiting conditions in a dose-dependent manner and that its condensation coincides with imbibition. Moreover, the extent of FLOE1 condensation is directly correlated with seed germination. An interesting observation is that despite germination being a binary decision for a seed, FLOE1 condensation displays a large variation at the cellular and tissue levels. The link between cellular variability and organism-scale variability in seeds is still unclear ( Mitchell et al., 2017 60. Mitchell, J. ∙ Johnston, I.G. ∙ Bassel, G.W. Variability in seeds: biological, ecological, and agricultural implications J. Exp. Bot. 2017; 68 :809-817 PubMed Google Scholar ), and future work should aim to elucidate how embryos integrate a distribution of cellular phenotypes within a tissue into an ON/OFF switch decision.
To test whether FLOE1’s biophysical state is important for its function as a germination regulator, we dissected its molecular grammar and interrogated mutants for their ability to rescue the floe1-1 phenotype. First, we found that FLOE1’s phase behavior is tuned by opposing forces exerted by two disordered domains. While the prion-like QPS domain drives condensation, its DS domain tunes the material state by fluidizing FLOE1 condensates. This information allowed us to engineer two key mutants: one that can no longer phase separate (ΔQPS) and one that presents solid-like condensates (ΔDS). Second, by complementing floe1-1 with these mutants, we find that the QPS domain is required for its function, whereas the ΔDS mutant acts in a gain-of-function manner leading to a dramatic germination phenotype. In the evolutionary game theory framework ( Gremer and Venable, 2014 34. Gremer, J.R. ∙ Venable, D.L. Bet hedging in desert winter annual plants: optimal germination strategies in a variable environment Ecol. Lett. 2014; 17 :380-387 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ; Johnston and Bassel, 2018 40. Johnston, I.G. ∙ Bassel, G.W. Identification of a bet-hedging network motif generating noise in hormone concentrations and germination propensity in Arabidopsis J. R. Soc. Interface. 2018; 15 :20180042 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Villa Martín et al., 2019 89. Villa Martín, P. ∙ Muñoz, M.A. ∙ Pigolotti, S. Bet-hedging strategies in expanding populations PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15 :e1006529 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), the ΔDS mutant behaves like a “high-stakes gambler”—it perceives the risk of germination under stress (e.g., seedling dying) to be lower than the chance of there being a change in the environment (e.g., increased rainfall). Thus, our work shows that the emergent properties of a biomolecular condensate can tune fitness in vivo , by tuning bet-hedging strategies at a crucial step in a seed’s life ( Figure 5 G).
The observation that variation in FLOE1 sequence and its expression level tune germination make it a prime candidate as a seed bet-hedging gene. We made use of available transcriptomic, physiological, and climatologic data of A. thaliana ecotypes to test this hypothesis and found evidence that wild populations might use FLOE1 variation to tune their bet-hedging strategies according to their environment’s predictability. By analyzing the conservation of FLOE1, we find a vast repertoire of FLOE sequence diversity and phase separation behavior, suggesting the possibility that other species may also use this gene family to fine-tune germination as a local adaptation mechanism. Of note, the FLOE family precedes the origin of seed plants, and even in A. thaliana , FLOE1 homologs—FLOE2 and FLOE3—show a broader tissue expression ( Waese et al., 2017 91. Waese, J. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Pasha, A. ... ePlant: Visualizing and Exploring Multiple Levels of Data for Hypothesis Generation in Plant Biology Plant Cell. 2017; 29 :1806-1821 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ), pointing to potential functions beyond seed germination.
In conclusion, we have identified a putative plant water potential sensor that undergoes reversible hydration-dependent phase separation and regulates seed germination. Our findings have direct implications for not only cell biology and ecology but also agriculture. By providing a set of guiding principles to engineer a novel biomolecular condensate ( Hastings and Boeynaems, 2021 37. Hastings, R.L. ∙ Boeynaems, S. Designer Condensates: A Toolkit for the Biomolecular Architect J. Mol. Biol. 2021; 433 :166837 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hope to inspire the development of designer crops engineered to withstand the effects of climate change.

Section: Limitations of the study

The precise molecular function of FLOE1 remains unresolved. Our data are consistent with FLOE1 functioning at the transition between the desiccated state of the dry embryo and the reactivated hydrated state—when the protein undergoes reversible condensation. But there are alternative interpretations. It is possible that FLOE1 might have a function independent of phase separation. The ΔQPS mutant that we made to prevent condensation might disrupt this other FLOE1 function in the dispersed state independent of its ability to form a condensate. It is also formally possible that the ΔDS mutant, despite being in a constitutively condensed state, might have an enhanced function in a very minor dispersed fraction that we cannot readily detect. Future work will be needed to precisely define contributions of FLOE1 function in the disperse versus condensed state. Because FLOE1 is dispersed in the dry state of the embryo, these analyses represent technical challenges, and new experimental methods will be needed. Currently, the tools to investigate dry biological matter are limited. Perhaps techniques can be borrowed from the material science field to study the dry state.

Arabidopsis thaliana plants from which seeds were harvested for the experimental assays were grown in soil (PRO-MIX® HP Mycorrhizae) inside growth cabinets (Percival) held at 22°C and 55% humidity with a 16/8 hour photoperiod (130 μmol.m -2 .s -1 ). Seeds were stratified for 3 days at 4°C in darkness to break dormancy. Plants from each genotype were randomly distributed and rotated every day until bolting to minimize environmental variations. When siliques began to mature, humidity was decreased to 45% as recommended by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) ( ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/ABRC/abrc_plant_growth.pdf ). Harvested seeds were air-dried for a week before being stored in Eppendorf tubes at 4°C.
Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco) plants were grown in soil (PRO-MIX® PGX) inside chambers held at 22°C with a 16/8 hour photoperiod (130 μmol.m -2 .s -1 ).
In this study, “MS medium” refers to Murashige and Skoog medium with the following recipe: 0.5X Murashige and Skoog basal salt mixture (PhytoTechnologies Laboratories) at a pH of 5.7 supplemented with 0.8% agar (Difco) and 1% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich)).
The mutant line floe1-1 (SALK_048257C) was obtained from ABRC and genotyped using primers priFLOE1cds-FWD/REV and the Salk genotyping primer LBb1.3 ( Table S3 ). It was confirmed to be a knockout mutant by RT-qPCR ( Figure S6 A) as described in the RT-qPCR analyses section.
Transgenic plants were generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated (GV3101 strain) transformation ( Clough, 2005 22. Clough, S.J. Floral dip: agrobacterium-mediated germ line transformation Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 286 :91-102 PubMed Google Scholar ) of floe1-1 with the constructs described in the Plant plasmid construction section, with the exception of the control transgenic line overexpressing YFP-FLAG used in Figure S1 C that was generated by introducing the transgene into Col-0. Transgenic seedlings (T 1 ) were selected with Basta and lines containing only one T-DNA construct were selected for further characterization by determining the Mendelian segregation ratio (3:1) of Basta-resistant seedlings in their T 2 progeny. Homozygote T 2 lines were then identified by verifying that T 3 seedlings were 100% Basta-resistant.
FLOE1 CRISPR lines were generated using the Staphylococcus aureus CRISPR-Cas9 system ( Steinert et al., 2015 84. Steinert, J. ∙ Schiml, S. ∙ Fauser, F. ... Highly efficient heritable plant genome engineering using Cas9 orthologues from Streptococcus thermophilus and Staphylococcus aureus Plant J. 2015; 84 :1295-1305 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ) and by following the protocol described in https://www.botanik.kit.edu/molbio/940.php . A region within the QPS-rich region was identified as having an NNGGGT protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) downstream of a protospacer sequence (5′ TTACAGCCCCCAGACTGGC 3′) that did not have any significant similarities to other genomic regions. The corresponding guide RNA was inserted in the BbsI site of the pEn-Sa-Chimera vector through digestion-ligation following hybridization of the oligo duplex priCRISPR-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ), to generate pEn-Sa-Chimera-FLOE1. The resulting sgRNA coding vector was then transferred to pDe-Sa-Cas9 through LR (Thermo Fisher Scientific) recombination, to generate pDe-Sa-Cas9-FLOE1. The final binary destination vector was then used to transform Agrobacterium (GV3101 strain), which was used to transform Col-0 plants using the floral dip method ( Clough, 2005 22. Clough, S.J. Floral dip: agrobacterium-mediated germ line transformation Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 286 :91-102 PubMed Google Scholar ). Seeds obtained from the T 0 parental lines were sown on MS medium supplemented with 30 mg/L Kanamycin (G-Biosciences) for selection of successfully transformed transgenics. Selected T 1 seedlings were then transferred to soil to mature. Genomic DNA was extracted from mature rosette leaves of each of these T 1 plants and the Cas9-recognition site within FLOE1 was amplified through PCR with Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using primers prigenoCRISPR-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ). Sequencing (Sequetech Inc.) of the amplicons revealed that twelve plants demonstrated heterogenous sequences at the targeted region, which were subsequently selected for growing the T 2 generation. For each selected T 1 plant, eight T 2 progeny were grown, and PCR amplification followed by sequencing of the FLOE1 amplicon was again performed on genomic DNA extracted from mature rosette leaves. Four individuals from the various T 2 populations ( floe1-2 , floe1-3 , floe1-4 , floe1-5 ) presented different homozygous mutations in the FLOE1 amplicon ( Table S3 ), leading to frameshift mutations and pre-mature stop codons in the QPS region, and were selected for further assays.
Arabidopsis thaliana genes were scored via the Expression Angler tool based on similarity to a “Developmental Map” expression pattern with “High Relative Expression” in “Dry Seed” and “Low Relative Expression” for all other tissues ( https://bar.utoronto.ca/ExpressionAngler/ ) ( Austin et al., 2016 6. Austin, R.S. ∙ Hiu, S. ∙ Waese, J. ... New BAR tools for mining expression data and exploring Cis-elements in Arabidopsis thaliana Plant J. 2016; 88 :490-504 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). The output was then normalized to Z-scores ( Table S1 ) and genes were considered as seed-specific if they had a Z score of 3 or higher. The MobiDB-lite disorder scores of each gene in the “Z > 3” and “Z < 3” groups were retrieved from the MobiDB (version 3.1) A. thaliana dataset ( https://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/dataset ) ( Piovesan et al., 2018 68. Piovesan, D. ∙ Tabaro, F. ∙ Paladin, L. ... MobiDB 3.0: more annotations for intrinsic disorder, conformational diversity and interactions in proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :D471-D476 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ), and their amino acid compositional profiles were obtained using the protr package (version 1.6-2) ( Xiao et al., 2015 95. Xiao, N. ∙ Cao, D.S. ∙ Zhu, M.F. ... protr/ProtrWeb: R package and web server for generating various numerical representation schemes of protein sequences Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :1857-1859 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ) in RStudio (version 1.2.5033). Genes in the “Z > 3” group were then checked for the presence of a predicted prion-like domain based on a list of Arabidopsis prion-like proteins ( Chakrabortee et al., 2016 21. Chakrabortee, S. ∙ Kayatekin, C. ∙ Newby, G.A. ... Luminidependens (LD) is an Arabidopsis protein with prion behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :6065-6070 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). For FLOE1’s disorder prediction per residue, we used PONDR VSL2 ( http://www.pondr.com ) ( Xue et al., 2010 96. Xue, B. ∙ Dunbrack, R.L. ∙ Williams, R.W. ... PONDR-FIT: a meta-predictor of intrinsically disordered amino acids Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804 :996-1010 Crossref Scopus (947) PubMed Google Scholar ) and for identifying its prion-like domain we used PLAAC ( http://plaac.wi.mit.edu ) ( Lancaster et al., 2014 48. Lancaster, A.K. ∙ Nutter-Upham, A. ∙ Lindquist, S. ... PLAAC: a web and command-line application to identify proteins with prion-like amino acid composition Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2501-2502 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In our study, we used the following naming convention: pPLASMID; PROMOTERp; GENE ; mutant ; and PROTEIN. Constructs were generated using the Gateway system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and vectors from the pGWB601-661 collection ( https://shimane-u.org/nakagawa/pgwb-tables/4.htm ) ( Nakagawa et al., 2007 63. Nakagawa, T. ∙ Kurose, T. ∙ Hino, T. ... Development of series of gateway binary vectors, pGWBs, for realizing efficient construction of fusion genes for plant transformation J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2007; 104 :34-41 Crossref Scopus (1320) PubMed Google Scholar ) as follows:
FLOE1’s genomic region from its promoter, as predicted by AGRIS ( Davuluri et al., 2003 24. Davuluri, R.V. ∙ Sun, H. ∙ Palaniswamy, S.K. ... AGRIS: Arabidopsis gene regulatory information server, an information resource of Arabidopsis cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4 :25 Crossref Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ), to its last coding codon was amplified by Phusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific) PCR from Col-0 DNA (extracted with DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN)) using the prigFLOE1-FWD/REV primers ( Table S3 ). The amplicon was first cloned into pDONR221 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using BP Clonase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then subcloned into pGWB604, pGWB610, and pGWB633 ( Nakagawa et al., 2007 63.

Bioeng. 2007; 104 :34-41 Crossref Scopus (1320) PubMed Google Scholar ) using LR Clonase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate pFLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP, pFLOE1p:FLOE1-FLAG, and pFLOE1p:FLOE1-GUS respectively.
pFLOE1p:FLOE1ΔDS-GFP, pFLOE1p:FLOE1ΔQPS-GFP, and pFLOE1p:FLOE1ΔDUF-GFP were obtained by modifying pFLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) with primers priDSdeletion-FWD/REV, priQPSdeletion-FWD/REV, and priDUFdeletion-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ) respectively.
An entry vector containing the YFP gene was donated by Dr. Zhiyong Wang (Carnegie Institution for Science, USA) and another one, G18395, containing FLOE1 ’s coding sequence was obtained from ABRC. The two genes were then transferred from the entry vector into the binary vector pB7HFC3_0 ( Bossi et al., 2017 17. Bossi, F. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Xiao, J. ... Systematic discovery of novel eukaryotic transcriptional regulators using sequence homology independent prediction BMC Genomics. 2017; 18 :480 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Gateway cloning (Life Technologies), to create the vectors p35S:YFP-FLAG and p35S:FLOE1-FLAG.
Arabidopsis genes: The coding sequences of FLOE1 ’s isoforms, FLOE1.1 and FLOE1.2 , were amplified by Phusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific) PCR from the entry vector G18395 using priFLOE1.1-FWD/REV and priFLOE1.2-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ) and then BP recombined into pDONR221 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate pDONR221-FLOE1.1 and pDONR221-FLOE1.2. These were then transferred by LR recombination into pGWB605 ( Nakagawa et al., 2007 63. Nakagawa, T. ∙ Kurose, T. ∙ Hino, T. ... Development of series of gateway binary vectors, pGWBs, for realizing efficient construction of fusion genes for plant transformation J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2007; 104 :34-41 Crossref Scopus (1320) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate p35S:FLOE1.1-GFP and p35S:FLOE1.2-GFP. Similarly, p35S:FLOE1.1-RFP and p35S:FLOE1.2-RFP were generated by subcloning FLOE1.1 and FLOE1.2 into pGWB660 ( Nakagawa et al., 2007 63. Nakagawa, T. ∙ Kurose, T. ∙ Hino, T. ... Development of series of gateway binary vectors, pGWBs, for realizing efficient construction of fusion genes for plant transformation J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2007; 104 :34-41 Crossref Scopus (1320) PubMed Google Scholar ). The N-terminal version p35S:GFP-FLOE1.1 was generated by LR recombination of G18395 into pGWB606 ( Nakagawa et al., 2007 63. Nakagawa, T. ∙ Kurose, T. ∙ Hino, T. ... Development of series of gateway binary vectors, pGWBs, for realizing efficient construction of fusion genes for plant transformation J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2007; 104 :34-41 Crossref Scopus (1320) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate p35S:FLOE2-GFP and p35S:FLOE3-GFP, the coding sequences of FLOE2 and FLOE3 were obtained from a cDNA library from 5-day old Col-0 seedlings by PCR amplification using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the primers priFLOE2-FWD/REV and priFLOE3-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ). Total cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from total RNA extracted with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The FLOE2 and FLOE3 amplicons were then BP recombined into pDONR221 before being transferred by LR recombination into: 1) pGWB605 to generate p35S:FLOE2-GFP and p35S:FLOE3-GFP; and 2) pGWB660 to generate p35S:FLOE2-RFP and p35S:FLOE3-RFP.
Mutated FLOE1 versions: FLOE1wt, FLOE1Δnucl, FLOE1ΔCC, FLOE1ΔQPS, and FLOE1-QPS-15xY-S were amplified from the corresponding human expression vectors described in Human plasmid construction using prihFLOE1-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ), and BP recombined into pDONR221 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before being transferred by LR recombination into pGWB605 to generate p35S:FLOE1wt-GFP, p35S:FLOE1Δnucl-GFP, p35S:FLOE1ΔCC-GFP, p35S:FLOE1ΔQPS-GFP, and p35S:FLOE1-QPS-15xY-S-GFP. p35S:FLOE1ΔDS-GFP and p35S:FLOE1ΔDUF-GFP were obtained by the same process but with different primer pairs: prihFLOE1ΔDS-FWD/prihFLOE1-REV and prihFLOE1-FWD/prihFLOE1ΔDUF-REV ( Table S3 ), respectively. p35S:FLOE1ΔDS-RFP was similarly generated by subcloning into pGWB660.
Non- Arabidopsis FLOE1 homologs: Protein sequences for all FLOE1 homologs shown in Figure 7 and Figure S6 K were obtained from UniProt ( UniProt Consortium, 2019 87. UniProt Consortium UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D506-D515 Crossref Scopus (5038) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Phytozome v13 ( Goodstein et al., 2012 33. Goodstein, D.M. ∙ Shu, S. ∙ Howson, R. ... Phytozome: a comparative platform for green plant genomics Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :D1178-D1186 Crossref Scopus (3503) PubMed Google Scholar ). Their corresponding DNA sequences were generated with codon-optimization for Nicotiana benthamiana expression using IDT’s codon optimization tool ( http://www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/codon-optimization-tool?returnurl=%2FCodonOpt ) ( Table S3 ). The sequences were synthesized by GenScript Biotech Corporation (Piscataway, NJ) with flanking attB sites for subsequent BP cloning into pDONR221 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). They were then subcloned into pGWB605 by LR recombination to generate p35S:OptimizedHOMOLOG-GFP constructs (where HOMOLOG refers to the relevant FLOE1 homolog).
All Viridiplantae protein sequences containing the highly-conserved DUF1421 domain were retrieved from UniProt ( UniProt Consortium, 2019 87. UniProt Consortium UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D506-D515 Crossref Scopus (5038) PubMed Google Scholar ). After removal of duplicates due to re-annotations, the remaining 791 sequences ( Table S3 ) were submitted to the phylogenetic analysis tool NGPhylogeny.fr ( Lemoine et al., 2019 49. Lemoine, F. ∙ Correia, D. ∙ Lefort, V. ... NGPhylogeny.fr: new generation phylogenetic services for non-specialists Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W260-W265 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default settings. The FastME Output Tree was then uploaded to iTOL (version 5) ( Letunic and Bork, 2019 51. Letunic, I. ∙ Bork, P. Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v4: recent updates and new developments Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W256-W259 Crossref Scopus (4077) PubMed Google Scholar ) for tree visualization.
All monocot and eudicot sequences from the FLOE1-like and FLOE2-like clades were aligned using the msa package (version 1.20.0) in R ( Bodenhofer et al., 2015 12. Bodenhofer, U. ∙ Bonatesta, E. ∙ Horejš-Kainrath, C. ... msa: an R package for multiple sequence alignment Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3997-3999 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). The DS and QPS regions of the homologs were defined as aligning to the DS and QPS regions of FLOE1. The lengths of these regions were used for subsequent analysis.
Agrobacterium cultures (GV3101 strain) carrying the relevant constructs were grown overnight at 28°C in LB broth (Fisher BioReagents) containing 25 mg/L rifampicin (Fisher BioReagents), 50 mg/mL gentamicin (GoldBio), and 50 mg/L spectinomycin (GoldBio). Cultures were washed four times with infiltration buffer (10 mM MgCl 2 (omniPur, EMD), 10 mM MES (pH 5.6) (J. T. Baker), and 100 uM acetosyringone (Sigma-Aldrich)) and diluted to reach an OD 600 of 0.8. Fully expanded 3 rd , 4 th , or 5 th leaves from 6-week-old tobacco plants were infiltrated with these diluted Agrobacterium cultures using Monoject 1mL Tuberculin Syringes (Covidien). For colocalization experiments, an equal amount of each culture was pre-mixed before infiltration. For each construct or combination of constructs, at least three individual tobacco plants were infiltrated.
Square (∼1cm) leaf segments were cut from tobacco leaves transiently expressing 35S:FLOE1-GFP or 35S:YFP-FLAG, and incubated for 15 minutes in either 1 M NaCl to induce plasmolysis ( Zhou et al., 2019 98. Zhou, Y. ∙ Sarker, U. ∙ Neumann, G. ... The LaCEP1 peptide modulates cluster root morphology in Lupinus albus Physiol. Plant. 2019; 166 :525-537 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) or water (control). Cell walls were stained by supplementing the solutions with propidium iodide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. Samples were then imaged by confocal microscopy (see Plant image acquisition for details).
Seeds were first sterilized by vortexing in 70% ethanol for 5 minutes after which the solution was removed and replaced with 100% ethanol. Seeds were then placed on pre-sterilized filter papers (Grade 410, VWR) and left to dry in a laminar flow hood. Sterilized seeds were then sown on square Petri dishes (120 × 120 wide x 15 mm high (VWR)) containing 40 mL of MS medium (See Plant growth conditions section) supplemented with NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich), mannitol (Sigma-Aldrich), abscisic acid (MilliporeSigma), and paclobutrazol (MilliporeSigma) at the concentrations indicated below. Plates were then sealed with micropore surgical tape (3M) and covered in aluminum foil before being placed at 4°C. After exactly 120 h (5 days) of stratification to break seed dormancy, plates were transferred to a 24 h light (130 μmol.m -2 .s -1 ), 22°C growth cabinet (Percival). Germination (identified by radicle protrusion) was counted under a dissecting microscope.
Germination experiments were performed on seeds from two independent batches of plants (A and B) grown as described in the Plant growth conditions section. Germination data displayed in this publication are representative of 2-3 independent experiments as indicated in the relevant legends.
40 Col-0 and 40 floe1-1 plants were grown alongside 10 plants of each of the following lines: four independent CRISPR lines ( floe1-2, floe1-3, floe1-4, floe1-5 ), five independent FLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP lines, two independent FLOE1p:FLOE1-FLAG lines, one FLOE1p:FLOE1-GUS line, three independent FLOE1p:FLOE1ΔDS-GFP lines, four independent FLOE1p:FLOE1ΔQPS-GFP lines, and three independent FLOE1p:FLOE1ΔDUF-GFP lines. For each line, seeds from five plants were randomly pooled together which resulted in 2 biological replicates of each CRISPR and complemented line, and 8 biological replicates of Col-0 and floe1-1 . For each biological replicate and each germination condition (0, 80 mM, 100 mM, 120 mM, 140 mM, 160 mM, 180 mM, 195 mM, 200 mM, 210 mM, 220 mM, 230 mM and 240 mM NaCl), three technical replicates (random sampling from a biological replicate) were conducted. At the end of the 230 mM NaCl germination experiment (day 15), seeds that did not germinate were rinsed in sterile double-distilled water and sown on normal MS medium. Two days later, germination was scored to test whether they maintained their germination potential. The 80mM, 100mM, 120mM, 140mM, 160mM, 180mM, 200mM, 220mM, and 240mM NaCl experiments were conducted independently from the 195mM, 210mM, and 230mM NaCl experiments. For the paclobutrazol (PAC) and abscisic acid (ABA) experiments, seeds were pooled from all Col-0 or all floe1-1 biological replicates, totaling 40 plants for each genotype, and sown on MS medium supplemented with 2μM PAC (MilliporeSigma) and 5μM ABA (MilliporeSigma), respectively. Following 5 days of stratification, germination was counted daily for the ABA experiment and after 5 days for the PAC experiment. For each condition and genotype, three technical replicates were conducted.
14 Col-0 and 27 floe1-1 plants were grown alongside 6 plants of each of the following lines: three independent FLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP lines, two independent FLOE1p:FLOE1-FLAG lines, one FLOE1p:FLOE1-GUS line, and two independent 35S:FLOE1-FLAG lines. The 35S:FLOE1-FLAG lines failed to express FLOE1 as revealed by RT-qPCR ( Figure S2 D) and were therefore chosen as transgenic controls. Seeds from each individual plant were sown on MS medium (See Plant growth conditions section) supplemented with either mannitol (400 mM) or NaCl (190 mM, 205 mM, and 220 mM). For each biological replicate and each germination condition, three technical replicates were conducted.
Col-0 and floe1-1 seeds were sown on MS medium (See Germination experiments section) and stratified for 5 days. They were then placed vertically in a 16 h light (130 μmol.m -2 .s -1 ), 22°C growth cabinet (Percival). 4 days later, seedlings were transferred to plates containing MS medium supplemented with NaCl at the following concentrations: 40 mM, 80 mM, 120 mM, 160 mM, and 200 mM. 15 days later, plates were imaged and roots were quantified using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 79. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Seeds of the relevant GFP-tagged lines were submerged in either glycerin or in solutions of NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich), mannitol (Sigma-Aldrich), sorbitol (Sigma-Aldrich), cycloheximide (GoldBio) or double distilled water at the following concentrations for 15-30 min (NaCl: 0, 0.2 M, 0.4 M, 0.6 M, 0.8 M, 1 M, 1.2 M, 1.4 M, 1.6 M, 1.8 M, 2 M; mannitol: 0, 0.95 M; sorbitol: 0, 0.725 M, 1.45 M; cycloheximide: 1 g/L). They were then dissected to remove the seed coat and imaged by confocal microscopy (see Plant image acquisition for details). As controls, 35S:GFP ( Bossi et al., 2017 17. Bossi, F. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Xiao, J. ... Systematic discovery of novel eukaryotic transcriptional regulators using sequence homology independent prediction BMC Genomics. 2017; 18 :480 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) seeds were dissected in water to verify that GFP alone could not induce condensate formation, and Col-0 seeds were dissected in either water or 2 M NaCl to assess the level of autofluorescence of the protein storage vacuoles in the absence of GFP in these conditions.
FLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP seeds were sown on MS medium (See Plant growth conditions section) containing NaCl at the following concentrations: 80 mM, 120 mM, 160 mM, 200 mM, 240 mM, and 280 mM. After 5 days of stratification, plates were transferred to a 24 h light (130 μmol.m -2 .s -1 ), 22°C growth cabinet (Percival). After 24 h, seeds were transferred to glycerin and embryos were dissected out. Embryos were then imaged by confocal microscopy (see Plant image acquisition for details).
Three different types of FLOE1 condensate reversibility assays were performed: 1) Embryos from dry seeds were first dissected in glycerin as described above, and after imaging, glycerin was washed off from the embryos with water and the same embryos were imaged immediately in water (less than 5 minutes); 2) Seeds were submerged in water for 1 h before being transferred to 2 M NaCl for 10 min and imaged and vice versa (1 h in 2 M NaCl followed by 10 min in water); and 3) Seeds were submerged in water overnight and then left to dry for an additional day. Seeds were then either dissected in glycerin to obtain the condensate state of the dry seeds or in water to assess their ability to re-form condensates.
At the end of the 230 mM NaCl germination experiment described in the Germination experiments section (5 days of stratification followed by 15 days in light on MS medium supplemented with 230 mM NaCl), seeds that did not germinate were either: 1) dissected directly in glycerin to leave the hydration state of the seed unaltered; or 2) transferred first to standard MS medium and dissected in glycerin two hours later. Dissected embryos were then imaged by confocal microscopy to obtain a snapshot of their final condensate state (see Plant image acquisition ).
FLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP and 35S:YFP-FLAG flower buds were manually self-pollinated 11, 8, 6 and 4 days before dissection to obtain developing siliques carrying embryos at mature, torpedo, heart and globular stages, respectively. Manual self-pollination entailed removing all floral parts except the pistil (female organ harboring ovules) from unopened floral buds where anthers have not shed pollen. Stamen (male organ containing pollen) from fully opened flowers from the same plant were used to pollinate the exposed pistils. Seeds from the various developmental stages were dissected either in glycerin or water and imaged by confocal microscopy (see Plant image acquisition ).
Embryos from FLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP seeds were dissected in 1.6M NaCl, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Thermo Fisher) was added at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/mL. After 10 min, embryos were imaged by confocal microscopy (see Plant image acquisition for details).
FLOE1p:FLOE1-GUS seeds carrying embryos at different developmental stages were incubated at 37°C overnight in GUS staining solution ( Jefferson et al., 1987 39. Jefferson, R.A. ∙ Kavanagh, T.A. ∙ Bevan, M.W. GUS fusions: beta-glucuronidase as a sensitive and versatile gene fusion marker in higher plants EMBO J. 1987; 6 :3901-3907 Crossref Scopus (8732) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of dry seeds, seed coats were first removed (as they were impermeable to the staining solution) and embryos were incubated at 37°C for one hour in GUS staining solution. Following the incubation, samples were destained in 70% ethanol at room temperature for 24 hours and embryos were dissected out (in the case of developing siliques) before imaging. Pictures were taken with a compound microscope (Nikon) and a dissecting microscope (Leica MZ6 microscope).
Embryos and tobacco leaves were imaged at room temperature on a LEICA TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope in resonant scanning mode using the Leica Application Suite X software. All samples were imaged with a HC PL APO CS2 63X/1.20 water objective with the exception of embryos submerged in glycerin that were imaged with a 63X/1.30 glycerin objective and of embryos of early developmental stages that were imaged with a HC PL APO CS2 20x/0.75 dry objective. GFP, RFP, YFP, DAPI and propidium iodide fluorescence signals were detected by exciting with a white light laser at 488 nm, 561 nm, 514 nm, 405 nm, and 536 nm, respectively, and by collecting emission from 500-550 nm, 591-637 nm, 524-574 nm, 425-475 nm, and 600-650 nm, respectively, on a HyD SMD hybrid detector (Leica) with a lifetime gate filter of 1-6 ns to reduce background autofluorescence due to chlorophyll (tobacco) or protein storage vacuoles (embryos). Z stacks were collected with a bidirectional 96-line averaging while single-frame images (tobacco) were collected with a bidirectional 1024-line averaging. For colocalization experiments, samples were imaged sequentially between each line to ensure that the colocalization signals were not due to bleed-throughs. Images shown were representative of at least three biological replicates for each construct (tobacco) or line ( Arabidopsis ). All samples that were compared in the publication were imaged with the same magnification and laser intensity.
For each embryo radicle and experimental condition, maximum projection images of their corresponding Z stacks were obtained using the Leica Application Suite X software. ROIs were then manually drawn around each individual cell to obtain their standard deviation (RMS) and mean intensity levels. Heterogeneity scores were obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the mean (coefficient of variation). Between 363 and 461 cells were measured per embryo with a total of 3 embryos per condition. Cells were characterized as exhibiting FLOE1 condensates if their heterogeneity score was higher than the top 5 percentile of the 2 M NaCl condition (heterogeneity cut-off = 0.3 arbitrary units (a.u.)).
For A. thaliana embryo radicles and tobacco leaves, individual slices of a Z stack were analyzed using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 79. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ). Individual condensates were identified using a threshold, and subsequently measured for their area. A total of 3-4 embryos per condition were analyzed. For tobacco leaves data: isoform and paralog comparisons were performed on granules with a minimum size of 0.2 μm 2 and 0.5 μm 2 , respectively.
Seeds from twelve floe1-1 and fourteen Col-0 biological replicates (individual plants from Batch B described in the Germination experiments section) were used for the seed weight analysis. Seeds were weighed on a Sartorius M2P scale in batches of nine to twenty seeds and the process was replicated three times per biological replicate. The average weight per seed was calculated and used for subsequent statistical analysis.
Seeds from fourteen and sixteen biological replicates of floe1-1 and Col-0, respectively, were used for the seed size and aspect ratio analyses. Seed images were scanned using a Canon CanoScan LiDE 700 F (Canon Inc). All images were scanned at 600 dpi and, for ease of collection, the seeds were placed in transparent bags before scanning. The number of seeds per image varied, but ten seeds per sample were randomly selected and analyzed for area quantification and aspect ratio using Fiji ( Schneider et al., 2012 81. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (43944) PubMed Google Scholar ). This process was replicated ten times per biological replicate to obtain a total of one hundred seeds per biological replicate.
DNA-free total RNA was extracted from seeds and siliques using the protocol described in Meng and Feldman (2010) 59. Meng, L. ∙ Feldman, L. A rapid TRIzol-based two-step method for DNA-free RNA extraction from Arabidopsis siliques and dry seeds Biotechnol. J. 2010; 5 :183-186 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar as summarized in this section. For each extraction, 50-100 mg of seeds or siliques were ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. While still frozen, 1.2 mL of extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% sarkosyl, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added and the solution was transferred to an RNase-free Eppendorf tube. After vortexing for 5 min, the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 11,000 g, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. 500 μL chloroform were then added and the mixture was vortexed for 2 min. 500 μL acid phenol (water saturated) were added and the tube was vortexed for an additional 2 min. After centrifugation at 11,000 g for 15 min, the upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube containing 90 μL 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2). After mixing, 600 μL isopropanol were added and mixed. The solution was then incubated for 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 11,000 g. After removal of the supernatant, 1 mL 75% ethanol was added to the pellet, and the tube was centrifuged at 11,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was then discarded, and the tube was briefly spun down so that any leftover supernatant could be removed with a 10 μL pipette. The pellet was left to dry for 5 min. After this step, the dried pellet was resuspended in 1 mL TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) by vortexing until the pellet was fully dissolved. 200 μL chloroform were then added and mixed by vortexing for 15 s. The tube was then incubated for 2 min and centrifuged at 11,000 g at 4°C for 15 min. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube containing 500 μL isopropanol. After mixing, the tube was incubated for 10 min. It was then centrifuged at 11,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 1.2 mL 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 11,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the tube was then briefly spun down so that any leftover supernatant could be removed with a 10 μL pipette. The pellet was left to dry for 5 min. It was then dissolved in 100 μL water and mixed with 10 μL 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 250 μL 100% ethanol. After incubation for 20 min, the tube was centrifuged at 11,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was then washed with 1.2 mL 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 11,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the tube was then briefly spun down so that any leftover supernatant could be removed with a 10 μL pipette. The pellet was left to dry for 5 min, and then resuspended in 30 μL water. RNA quantity and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Unless otherwise indicated, all steps were performed at room temperature in a laminar flow hood cleaned with RNaseOUT (G-Biosciences). All solutions were made using UltraPure DNase/RNase-Free Distilled Water (Invitrogen).
cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of extracted RNA using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), per manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR was performed using the SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX Kit (Bioline). Primers used to quantify FLOE1 expression were priqPCRFLOE1set1-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ), with the exception of the qPCRs conducted on the CRISPR lines ( Table S3 ) as well as on siliques and seeds from different developmental stages ( Figure S1 A) where priqPCRFLOE1set2-FWD/REV were used ( Table S3 ). The different developmental stages of siliques were defined based on color: dark green, light green, and yellow, which roughly correspond to 4-7, 8-10, and 11-13 days post-anthesis, respectively ( Mizzotti et al., 2018 61. Mizzotti, C. ∙ Rotasperti, L. ∙ Moretto, M. ... Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis of Arabidopsis Siliques Discloses Genes Essential for Fruit Development and Maturation Plant Physiol. 2018; 178 :1249-1268 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reference gene that was used to normalize gene expression levels, At5G25760 ( PEX4 ), was chosen for consistent expression in seeds ( Dekkers et al., 2012 25. Dekkers, B.J. ∙ Willems, L. ∙ Bassel, G.W. ... Identification of reference genes for RT-qPCR expression analysis in Arabidopsis and tomato seeds Plant Cell Physiol. 2012; 53 :28-37 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used a primer pair, priAT5G25760-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ), which was reported in Czechowski et al. (2005) 23. Czechowski, T. ∙ Stitt, M. ∙ Altmann, T. ... Genome-wide identification and testing of superior reference genes for transcript normalization in Arabidopsis Plant Physiol. 2005; 139 :5-17 Crossref Scopus (2548) PubMed Google Scholar . Reactions were run on 96-well plates in the LightCycler® 480 Instrument II system and were repeated three times.
ELISA assays were performed using the GFP ELISA Kit from Abcam. ∼300 seeds from five independent FLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP lines, three independent FLOE1p:FLOE1ΔDS-GFP lines, four independent FLOE1p:FLOE1ΔQPS-GFP lines, three independent FLOE1p:FLOE1ΔDUF-GFP lines, and from Col-0 (WT) were ground in liquid nitrogen and mixed with 1 mL of “1X Cell Extraction Buffer PTR” provided in the kit and supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (MilliporeSigma). Samples were diluted in a 1:20 ratio and then quantified following the manufacturer’s instructions using a Tecan INFINITE M1000 PRO plate reader.
To calculate the proportion of cellular volume occupied by the cytosol in embryo cells of dry seeds, we first calculated the surface area represented by the cytoplasm excluding nuclei and protein storage vacuoles using transmission electron microscopy and electron tomography (see Transmission electron microscopy and electron tomography of Arabidopsis seeds section below). Based on the analysis of 43 cells from embryos sectioned in random directions, we estimated that surface area to be approximately 68% (±7% SD) of the total cellular area, as seen in our micrographs. To determine how much of that 68% of cytoplasmic content is cytosol, we calculated seven electron tomograms of randomly chosen and sectioned areas of dry embryos, segmented all membrane bound organelles, except nuclei and vacuoles since they have already been accounted for. We then calculated the volume of these organelles (mainly lipid droplets, plastids, and Golgi stacks) and subtracted them from the tomographic cellular volume to estimate the proportion of cytosol, which was approximately 24.6% (±6.5% SD). Of note, very few ribosomes are detected in dry seeds, so we did not consider them in our volumetric analysis. We then calculated that 24.6% (cytosol) of 68% (cytoplasm excluding nuclei and vacuoles) is 16.7%. Therefore, the average proportion of cytosol in an embryo cell in the dry seed is 16.7% of the total cellular volume.
To determine the cytosol volume of an entire embryo in order to estimate the concentration of FLOE1 in vivo , we set out to calculate the number and volume of all cells in the embryo. More specifically, we imaged full embryos to count the number of cells, and performed 3D analysis to quantify cellular volume (see 3D Cellular Resolution imaging of the mature Arabidopsis embryo section below). We estimated the cell number at 14,000 cells per embryo and the average cellular volume at 1,210 μm 3 . As such, we estimate the total cellular volume of an Arabidopsis thaliana embryo to be ∼17,000,000 μm 3 . Representative micrographs and tomographic reconstructions of embryo cells are depicted in Figures S5 B, S5C, S5E, and S5F and Video S1 .
Taken together, we concluded that the cytosol occupies approximately 2,840,000 μm 3 of the whole embryo. This number was subsequently used to calculate the cytoplasmic FLOE1 concentration in dry seeds (see Table S3 ). Based on ELISA assays on FLOE1-GFP tagged complemented lines, our estimate of the physiological FLOE1 concentration is 0.37 μM ± 0.18 μM. However, we would like to stress that this is a lower bound estimate of the physiological concentration as we need to account for potential loss of protein during sample prep (e.g., insoluble fraction) or potential effects of protein condensation on ELISA epitope availability.
We performed a dilution series of FLOE1 in vitro and found that it could form visible condensates up to 1 μM ( Figure S4 D). While this concentration is higher than our lower bound estimate of the in vivo FLOE1 concentration, we want to stress that we did not make use of any molecular crowders in our test tube phase separation assays. Molecular crowders (e.g., PEG, dextrans, etc.) are commonly used to mimic the crowding of the cytoplasmic environment in phase separation assays. Yet, given that these molecules can have pleiotropic effects and can artificially drive condensation of proteins, we instead tested whether FLOE1 had the ability to phase separate in isolation without the need of such polymers and their potential confounding effects. Our results indicate that FLOE1 can phase separate at concentrations in the range of our best estimate of its physiological concentration.
Dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 were dissected and frozen in a Leica ICE high-pressure freezer. Samples were freeze-substituted in 2% osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ) in acetone for 12 h at −80°C followed by infiltration in Epon resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at room temperature. Thin (70 nm) and semi-thin (200 nm) thick sections were prepared in a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome, mounted in single slot grids coated with carbon-formvar, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% methanol and Reynold’s lead citrate (2.6% lead nitrate and 3.5% sodium citrate, pH 12). Colloidal gold particles of 10 nm in diameter were applied to both surfaces of the semi-thick sections to be used as fiducial markers during the alignment of the series of tilted images. Sections were imaged in a Thermo Fisher Talos F200C operated at 200 kV. For electron tomography, images were taken from +60° to –60° at 1.0° intervals using the SerialEM software ( Mastronarde, 2005 56. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ) and collected in a Ceta 16-megapixel CMOS camera at a pixel size of 1 nm. Tomograms were calculated using the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) algorithm and segmented using the IMOD package ( Kremer et al., 1996 47. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (4018) PubMed Google Scholar ). The thinning factor for each tomogram was calculated and corrected for in the models.
Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 79. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for calculating the area of large organelles such as vacuoles and nuclei in the thin sections. Imodinfo within IMOD was employed to calculate the volume of other organelles and that of the cytoplasm.
Wild-type Col-0 seeds were imbibed for 3 h on MS plates, then embryos were dissected and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. Samples were then rinsed 3 times in water and stained using the mPA-PI method as previously reported ( Bassel et al., 2014 11. Bassel, G.W. ∙ Stamm, P. ∙ Mosca, G. ... Mechanical constraints imposed by 3D cellular geometry and arrangement modulate growth patterns in the Arabidopsis embryo Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :8685-8690 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ; Truernit et al., 2008 86. Truernit, E. ∙ Bauby, H. ∙ Dubreucq, B. ... High-resolution whole-mount imaging of three-dimensional tissue organization and gene expression enables the study of Phloem development and structure in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2008; 20 :1494-1503 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Embryos were imaged using a Zeiss LSM710 and cells were segmented in 3D using MorphoGraphX ( Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015 9. Barbier de Reuille, P. ∙ Routier-Kierzkowska, A.L. ∙ Kierzkowski, D. ... MorphoGraphX: A platform for quantifying morphogenesis in 4D eLife. 2015; 4 :05864 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each cell number and cell volume were calculated using the Heatmap function of this software.
Two RNA-seq experiments were conducted: the first on seeds from floe1-1 and Col-0, and the second on seeds from FLOE1p:FLOE1ΔDS-GFP and FLOE1p:FLOE1-GFP. Seeds were subjected to three conditions: 1) dry; 2) imbibed in MS medium; and 3) imbibed in MS with 220 mM NaCl. Three biological replicates corresponding to pooled seeds from different plants were performed per condition, with 50 mg of mature seeds used per biological replicate. For condition (1), RNA was extracted directly from dry seeds using the protocol described in the RNA extraction from seeds and siliques section. For condition (2), dry seeds were sown onto agar plates of MS medium conditions and cold-stratified for 5 days at 4°C in the dark. Plates were subsequently transferred to and held in a growth cabinet (Percival) for 4 hours under light (130 μmol.m−2.s−1) and 22°C. After the 4-hour incubation, imbibed seeds were scraped from each plate and transferred to a clean mortar and pestle and ground in liquid nitrogen. RNA was then extracted as described in the RNA extraction from seeds and siliques section. Condition (3) was conducted in parallel and using the same experimental settings with the MS medium supplemented with 220 mM NaCl.
Samples from all biological replicates were first sent to the Stanford University Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility (Stanford, CA) for quantification and quality analysis using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Samples were then sent to Novogene Corporation Inc. (Sacramento, CA) for RNA-seq library preparation (250-300 bp insert cDNA library) and sequencing (2x150 bp paired-end reads on an Illumina Platform).
Reads were mapped with HISAT2 to the Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR10 reference genome using the Galaxy (Version 2.1.0+galaxy5) web platform ( https://usegalaxy.eu ) ( Afgan et al., 2018 3. Afgan, E. ∙ Baker, D. ∙ Batut, B. ... The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2018 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W537-W544 Crossref Scopus (2444) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting BAM files were then analyzed on RStudio (version 1.2.5033) using the DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 52. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ) and TxDB.Athaliana.BioMart.plantsmart28 (Bioconductor) packages. Genes with adjusted p value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment of the differentially expressed genes was obtained using g:Profiler ( https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost ) ( Raudvere et al., 2019 72. Raudvere, U. ∙ Kolberg, L. ∙ Kuzmin, I. ... g:Profiler: a web server for functional enrichment analysis and conversions of gene lists (2019 update) Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W191-W198 Crossref Scopus (3026) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To obtain structural insight into the previously uncharacterized nucleation domain of FLOE1, we combined a set of integrative homology modeling approaches with all-atom simulations ( Figure S4 E). We first leveraged a number of homology-modeling based tools to perform de novo structural prediction, including SWISS-MODEL and Phyre2 ( Kelley et al., 2015 43. Kelley, L.A. ∙ Mezulis, S. ∙ Yates, C.M. ... The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :845-858 Crossref Scopus (7220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Waterhouse et al., 2018 94. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (7765) PubMed Google Scholar ). SWISS-MODEL strongly predicted the majority of the nucleation domain to consist of a trimeric coiled-coil, while in agreement Phyre2 predicted a single long helix with the appropriate exposed interfacial residues necessary for trimeric coiled-coil formation. The secondary structure prediction server PSIPRED identified a number of overlapping residues predicted to be helical ( McGuffin et al., 2000 58. McGuffin, L.J. ∙ Bryson, K. ∙ Jones, D.T. The PSIPRED protein structure prediction server Bioinformatics. 2000; 16 :404-405 Crossref Scopus (3010) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, all structural modeling tools predict this region to be highly helical and to form higher-order oligomeric assemblies, providing a molecular explanation for its observed cellular function.
To provide further support for the predicted helical structure of the nucleation domain, we turned to all-atom simulations. Simulations were performed with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model and CAMPARI Monte Carlo simulation engine ( Vitalis and Pappu, 2009 90. Vitalis, A. ∙ Pappu, R.V. ABSINTH: a new continuum solvation model for simulations of polypeptides in aqueous solutions J. Comput. Chem. 2009; 30 :673-699 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first generated an initial helical starting structure by applying a bias force to drive the protein into a single alpha helix. From this helical starting state, production simulations were run in which no bias was applied, and the system was able to evolve. Five independent simulations were performed with the reported helicity being the average of all five runs. Simulations were run using the ABSINTH implicit solvent model and abs_3.2_opls.prm parameters. Each simulation was run for 6.8 × 10 7 Monte Carlo steps with the first 6.0 × 10 6 steps discarded as equilibration. These simulations revealed a remarkably good agreement with the predictions from homology modeling tools ( Figure S4 E) including a break in helicity identified in the homology modeling tools between residues 130 and 140. Taken together, distinct structural and biophysical approaches converge on a model in which the nucleation domain drives higher-order assembly as a multivalent trimeric coiled-coil domain.
FLOE1’s coding sequence was transferred from G18395 (see Plant plasmid construction section) into pDEST-HisMBP (Addgene plasmid # 11085) ( Nallamsetty et al., 2005 64. Nallamsetty, S. ∙ Austin, B.P. ∙ Penrose, K.J. ... Gateway vectors for the production of combinatorially-tagged His6-MBP fusion proteins in the cytoplasm and periplasm of Escherichia coli Protein Sci. 2005; 14 :2964-2971 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ) using LR Clonase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A sequence encoding the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease recognition sequence, ENLYFQ, was then added between the MBP and FLOE1 coding sequences using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) with primers priTEV-FWD/REV ( Table S3 ) to generate pDEST-HisMBP-ENLYFQ-FLOE1. A sequence encoding ENLYFQ followed by FLOE1ΔQPS was synthesized by GenScript Biotech Corporation (Piscataway, NJ) with flanking attB sites for subsequent BP cloning into pDONR221 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting vector, pDONR221-ENLYFQ-FLOE1ΔQPS, was then subcloned into pDEST-HisMBP (Addgene plasmid # 11085) ( Nallamsetty et al., 2005 64. Nallamsetty, S. ∙ Austin, B.P. ∙ Penrose, K.J. ... Gateway vectors for the production of combinatorially-tagged His6-MBP fusion proteins in the cytoplasm and periplasm of Escherichia coli Protein Sci. 2005; 14 :2964-2971 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate pDEST-HisMBP-ENLYFQ-FLOE1ΔQPS.
BL-21(DE3) competent cells (Agilent) were transformed with the plasmids following supplier protocol and plated on LB agar plated with ampicillin selection overnight at 220 RPM and 37°C. Transformed cells were expressed in 6 L of LB at pH 7.4 with ampicillin selection. Expression was induced at OD 600 of 0.6 using 0.5 mM IPTG, and cells were left under shaking at 220 RPM and 16°C for 19 h prior to collection. Collected cells were spun down at 4°C for 8 min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended with 20 mL lysis buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8) and 1 cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche) per 1 L of expression, and the resuspended cells were lysed via homogenization for 8 min (Emulsiflex homogenizer) or via sonication (Qsonica Q700, 0.5 inch tip). The resulting cell lysate was spun down for 50 min at 19,500 g, and the supernatant was collected. Ni-NTA nickel beads (QIAGEN) were equilibrated with lysis buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8), then loaded with the lysate and washed with 50 mL of wash buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, pH 8) followed by 8 mL of Elution Buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 M NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, pH 8) all done at 4°C. The eluent was collected, spun down to remove aggregates, and further purified with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE). 5 mL of spun-down eluent was injected onto the column and ran at 0.5 mL/min at room temperature. Fractions were collected and the presence of the protein was verified using SDS-PAGE ( Figure S4 C). Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy images were taken from each peak immediately after SEC. Peak #1 showed many small aggregates (not shown) whereas Peak #2 was largely devoid of aggregates ( Figure S4 B).
Four successive rounds of SEC showed almost identical results, indicating that the protein remained intact for at least 24 hours. SDS-PAGE also showed almost identical bands from corresponding collected fractions. Of note is the distinction in properties between Peak #1 and Peak #2. Peak #1 elutes at the void volume of the column, meaning it is larger than what can be resolved with Superdex 200 (> 200 kDa) ( Figure S4 A) and results in amorphous aggregation in both the pre- and post-cleaved FLOE1. Peak #2 elutes afterward, implying it is closer to a monomeric state. It shows very little aggregation before cleavage and displays the spherical droplets indicative of phase separation after removing the MBP with TEV ( Figures S4 B and S4C). We therefore believe that peak #1 contains aggregates of FLOE1-MBP, while peak #2 contains the monomeric protein, and have chosen this peak for our cleavage reaction. This behavior has been observed for several other LLPS-forming proteins, such as FUS ( Burke et al., 2015 20. Burke, K.A. ∙ Janke, A.M. ∙ Rhine, C.L. ... Residue-by-Residue View of In Vitro FUS Granules that Bind the C-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II Mol. Cell. 2015; 60 :231-241 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All proteins were thawed and spun at 4°C, 20,800 g for 10 min to remove aggregates. TEV was added to 10 μM protein unless stated otherwise in a 1:50 w/w ratio in 20 mM TRIS and 150 mM NaCl, pH 8. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C and rotated using the Thermo Fisher tube revolver (speed 10). The cleavage reaction was confirmed with SDS-PAGE ( Figure S4 C). DIC images of the mixture following cleavage confirmed the appearance of round droplets ( Figure S4 B). For conditions using NaCl, the reaction was started with protein and TEV alone. A highly concentrated NaCl solution was added to the final required concentration after cleavage, and vortexed for 5 s immediately before imaging.
8 well silicone gaskets (Grace Bio labs) were used as chambers and placed on a Fisherbrand glass microscopy slide. 21 μL of sample were placed in each well and sealed with a #1.5 coverslip. DIC images were taken on a Zeiss Observer 3 inverted microscope using a 40x 0.9 NA dry objective 18-22 h after TEV addition, and after 10-15 minutes in the imaging chamber. Images were taken using a Hamamatsu Orca Flash v3.0 camera with an exposure time of 100 ms ( Figures S4 B, S4D, and S4F).
FLOE1 and derived mutant constructs for expression in human cells were optimized for human expression ( Table S3 ) and generated through custom synthesis and subcloning into the pcDNA3.1+N-eGFP backbone by Genscript (Piscataway, USA). Constructs to test the nucleation domain were synthesized and subcloned by Genscript into a custom pcDNA3.1+ backbone containing mCherry.
U2OS cells (ATCC, HTB-96) were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 for 24 h in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), high glucose, GlutaMAX + 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and pen/strep (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 24 h after transfection in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Slides were mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies). Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Images were processed using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 79. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ).
U2OS cells were cultured in glass bottom dishes (Ibidi) and transfected with GFP-FLOE1 constructs as described above. After 24 h, GFP-FLOE1 condensates were bleached and fluorescence recovery after bleaching was monitored using ZEN software on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with incubation chamber at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Data were analyzed as described previously ( Boeynaems et al., 2017 13. Boeynaems, S. ∙ De Decker, M. ∙ Tompa, P. ... Arginine-rich Peptides Can Actively Mediate Liquid-liquid Phase Separation Biol.-protocol. 2017; 7 :e2525 Crossref Google Scholar ). In brief, raw data were background subtracted, normalized using Excel, and plotted using GraphPad Prism 8.4.1 software.
U2OS cells were transfected at 80% confluency in Petri dishes, transfected for 24 h (see above) and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Na-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). After washing in the same buffer three times, the cells were scraped and centrifuged at 200 x g. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5% low melting point agarose (type VIIa, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1 M Na-cacodylate buffer and pelleted for 1 min at 1000x g. After solidification on ice, the agarose-embedded cell pellet was cut in small blocks, incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h at room temperature, washed 3x in milli-Q water and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series until 100% ethanol in steps of 5 minutes. Finally, following 2 washes with propylene oxide, the cells were infiltrated with epoxy resin (Agar 100, EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA) embedded in BEEM-capsules and cured for 48 h at 60°. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were cut from the polymerized samples with a Leica ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica, Vienna, AU), and post-stained with 4% uranyl acetate (SPI Supplies, Westchester, PA, USA) for 8 mins and Reynold’s lead citrate for 3 mins. Finally, the cells were observed and imaged at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV with a JEOL JEM1400 (Tokyo, JP) transmission electron microscope equipped with an 11 Mpx EMSIS Quemesa camera (EMSIS GmbH, Muenster, DE).
For CLEM, plated cells were lightly fixed with 2% PFA and washed 3x with PBS. The cells were scraped and pelleted at 200x g after which they were resuspended in 20% BSA and pelleted again at 200x g. The loosely packed cells in BSA were high-pressure frozen in a Leica Empact 2 high-pressure freezer (Leica, Vienna, Au), and submitted to a quick freeze-substitution protocol that preserves fluorescence ( McDonald and Webb, 2011 57. McDonald, K.L. ∙ Webb, R.I. Freeze substitution in 3 hours or less J. Microsc. 2011; 243 :227-233 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peddie et al., 2014 67. Peddie, C.J. ∙ Blight, K. ∙ Wilson, E. ... Correlative and integrated light and electron microscopy of in-resin GFP fluorescence, used to localise diacylglycerol in mammalian cells Ultramicroscopy. 2014; 143 :3-14 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, frozen samples were freeze-substituted in acetone containing 0.2% uranyl acetate and 5% H 2 O in a Styrofoam box on a rotating platform while temperature was allowed to rise to −50°C at which moment they were transferred to the Leica AFS2 automatic freeze-substitution apparatus equipped with a Leica Freeze Substitution Processor (FSP) processing robot (Leica, Vienna, AU). After total time elapsed between −80°C and −50°C amounted 1.5 h, samples were washed in acetone and infiltrated in Lowicryl HM20 resin (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA), and finally polymerized at −50°C by UV-light. Sections of 100 to 200 nm were cut with a Leica ultracut UCT ultramicrotome and deposited on an indium-tin oxide coverslip, and fluorescent images were taken with a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, DE). After this, the ITO-coverslip with sections was mounted to a support stub, placed inside the specimen chamber of a Zeiss Sigma scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, DE), and imaged at 1.25 −1.5 kV acceleration voltage with a Gatan backscattered electron detector. For correlation, fluorescent and electron images were overlaid using GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program).
For tomography, cells were prepared until embedded in agarose blocks as described above. Then, the blocks were incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide (EMS, US) and 1.5% Ferrocyanide in milli-Q water for 1 hour in the dark on ice, after which they were washed in milli-Q and incubated in 0.2% tannic acid in milli-Q for 30 mins. After washing in milli-Q the cells were osmicated a second time in 1% osmium tetroxide in milli-Q for 30 mins in the dark and washed in milli-Q. Then, samples were stained en bloc by incubation in 2% uranyl acetate (EMS, US) in milli-Q overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation in Walton’s lead aspartate for 30 mins at 60°C in the dark ( Walton, 1979 92. Walton, J. Lead aspartate, an en bloc contrast stain particularly useful for ultrastructural enzymology J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 27 :1337-1342 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). After washing in milli-Q, dehydration in a graded ethanol series and propylene oxide, the cells were infiltrated with epoxy resin (Agar 100), embedded in BEEM-capsules and cured for 2 days at 60°C. Finally, 200 nm sections were cut on a Leica ultracut S, and put on carbon-formvar coated tri-slot grids (Ted Pella, US). Image stacks from tilt series (−60° to 60°) were taken from selected regions with condensates with the same TEM as described above, but operated at 120 kV, using TEMography software (System In Frontiers, JP). Tomograms were made from the image stacks with IMOD ( Kremer et al., 1996 47. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (4018) PubMed Google Scholar ), using Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique algorithm and Non-linear Anisotropic Diffusion filtering. Segmentation was done with MIB (Fisher, NL) by thresholding after additional denoising with DenoisEM, a plug-in in Fiji ( Roels et al., 2020 74. Roels, J. ∙ Vernaillen, F. ∙ Kremer, A. ...

RNA-seq data from leaf tissue samples of 478 Arabidopsis thaliana worldwide ecotypes from the 1001 transcriptomes project ( Kawakatsu et al., 2016 42. Kawakatsu, T. ∙ Huang, S.C. ∙ Jupe, F. ..., 1001 Genomes Consortium Epigenomic Diversity in a Global Collection of Arabidopsis thaliana Accessions Cell. 2016; 166 :492-505 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S4 , sheet2), for which reliable FLOE1 expression was obtained, were mapped to the Araport11 reference using kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 18. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (5202) PubMed Google Scholar ) to estimate transcript abundance. Seed germination and dormancy phenotypes were obtained from multiple previously published studies ( Table S4 , sheet 1, n = 45) and phenotype measurements from each study were matched to each ecotype’s corresponding RNA-Seq data. This yielded variable overlap of A. thaliana samples, between 14-260, depending on the ecotypes used in each previously published study ( Atwell et al., 2010 5. Atwell, S. ∙ Huang, Y.S. ∙ Vilhjálmsson, B.J. ...

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :2526-2534 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). We looked for correlations between these 45 phenotypes and FLOE1 expression at both gene-level and transcript-level for each of the two FLOE1 isoforms (AT4G28300.1, AT4G28300.2). For transcript-level analysis, estimated TPM (transcripts per million) values were used directly. For gene-level expression analysis, estimated TPM of the two FLOE1 isoforms were summed, log 2 transformed, and mean centered. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated between FLOE1 expression (each isoform transcript and gene level) and the corresponding germination phenotypes. All expression-phenotypes correlations are listed in Table S4 sheet 1. In associated supplemental figures, TPM were log 2 transformed and mean centered prior to plotting for better visualization. Climate data from the original collection sites of 478 A. thaliana populations ( Table S4 ) was extracted from either 1960-1990 average climate maps of Europe (monthly precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature ( Hijmans et al., 2015 38. Hijmans, R.J. ∙ Cameron, S. ∙ Parra, J. ... WorldClim-Global Climate Data Free Climate Data for Ecological Modeling and GIS, 2015 Google Scholar )) or a time series between 1958 to 2017 (monthly temperature and precipitation values ( Abatzoglou et al., 2018 2. Abatzoglou, J.T. ∙ Dobrowski, S.Z. ∙ Parks, S.A. ... TerraClimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance from 1958-2015 Sci. Data. 2018; 5 :170191 Crossref Scopus (1440) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then conducted correlations with climate averages or coefficient of variation of time series data with FLOE1 expression. All correlations were computed as Spearman’s rank correlations, which are more robust to outliers and data distributions than linear Pearson’s correlation.
All data were analyzed using RStudio (version 1.2.5033), GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.1), and Excel. Statistical tests, p values, number of biological and technical replicates, and number of independent experiments are indicated in the figure legends. R packages used are described in the STAR Methods .
