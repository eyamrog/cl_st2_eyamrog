Title: Astrocytic trans -Differentiation Completes a Multicellular Paracrine Feedback Loop Required for Medulloblastoma Tumor Growth


Abstract: Summary

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor progression. However, the establishment and function of the TME remain obscure because of its complex cellular composition. Using a mouse genetic system called mosaic analysis with double markers (MADMs), we delineated TME evolution at single-cell resolution in sonic hedgehog (SHH)-activated medulloblastomas that originate from unipotent granule neuron progenitors in the brain. First, we found that astrocytes within the TME (TuAstrocytes) were trans -differentiated from tumor granule neuron precursors (GNPs), which normally never differentiate into astrocytes. Second, we identified that TME-derived IGF1 promotes tumor progression. Third, we uncovered that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is produced by tumor-associated microglia in response to interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation. Finally, we found that IL-4 is secreted by TuAstrocytes. Collectively, our studies reveal an evolutionary process that produces a multi-lateral network within the TME of medulloblastoma: a fraction of tumor cells trans -differentiate into TuAstrocytes, which, in turn, produce IL-4 that stimulates microglia to produce IGF1 to promote tumor progression.

Section: Introduction

A tumor is a living organ. Cancer cells actively interact with the tumor microenvironment (TME) at multiple levels of complexity for their survival ( Balkwill et al., 2012; Hanahan and Coussens, 2012; Quail and Joyce, 2013 7.

First, the TME consists of multiple cell types, including blood vessels ( Chung et al., 2010; Folkman, 1971 18. Chung, A.S. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Ferrara, N.

Second, TME cells crosstalk among themselves to form a supportive environment for tumor cells ( DeNardo et al., 2009; Gabrilovich et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2018; Stockmann et al., 2014 21.

Stockmann, C. ∙ Schadendorf, D. ∙ Klose, R. ... The impact of the immune system on tumor: angiogenesis and vascular remodeling Front. Oncol. 2014; 4 :69 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the TME dynamically co-evolves with tumor cells from initiation to progression and full malignancy ( Polyak et al., 2009; Weinberg, 2008 86. Polyak, K. ∙ Haviv, I. ∙ Campbell, I.G. Co-evolution of tumor cells and their microenvironment Trends Genet. 2009; 25 :30-38 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar 117. Weinberg, R.A. Coevolution in the tumor microenvironment Nat. Genet. 2008; 40 :494-495 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TME can even be reprogrammed during cancer therapy and contribute to therapeutic resistance ( Ahmed and Haass, 2018; Shee et al., 2018; Straussman et al., 2012; Su et al., 2018; Sun, 2016 2.

Sun, Y. Tumor microenvironment and cancer therapy resistance Cancer Lett. 2016; 380 :205-215 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it is imperative to deconstruct the complexity of the TME: how a heterogeneous TME is established and how the crosstalk between TME cells supports tumor progression.
Although histopathological analyses of patient samples can reveal TME composition and correlation with prognosis, animal models are needed to delineate the origin of each TME component and provide mechanistic insights into TME functions ( Arina et al., 2016; Özdemir et al., 2014; Wyckoff et al., 2004 5. Arina, A. ∙ Idel, C. ∙ Hyjek, E.M. ... Tumor-associated fibroblasts predominantly come from local and not circulating precursors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :7551-7556 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 81. Özdemir, B.C. ∙ Pentcheva-Hoang, T. ∙ Carstens, J.L. ...

A paracrine loop between tumor cells and macrophages is required for tumor cell migration in mammary tumors Cancer Res. 2004; 64 :7022-7029 Crossref Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ). To maximize the temporospatial resolution of TME analysis, our lab developed a mouse genetic system termed mosaic analysis with double markers (MADMs) ( Zong et al., 2005 131. Zong, H. ∙ Espinosa, J.S. ∙ Su, H.H. ... Mosaic analysis with double markers in mice Cell. 2005; 121 :479-492 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). From a heterozygous mouse, MADMs relies on Cre-loxP-guided inter-chromosomal mitotic recombination to generate sparse green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled cells homozygous null for a given tumor suppressor gene (TSG) and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-labeled wild-type (WT) sibling cells in somatic tissues. The rarity of TSG-null cells, resulting from low efficiency of recombination between two homologous chromosomes, not only mimics the clonal origin of cancer in human patients but also provides an unprecedented resolution for phenotypic analysis, and the immediate labeling of TSG mutant cells enables one to track them throughout the entire tumorigenic process ( Liu et al., 2011 65. Liu, C. ∙ Sage, J.C. ∙ Miller, M.R. ... Mosaic analysis with double markers reveals tumor cell of origin in glioma Cell. 2011; 146 :209-221 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Careful choice of a Cre transgene that specifically expresses in tumor but not TME cells would allow one to investigate the recruitment, activation, and organization of non-labeled TME cells in relation to GFP-labeled tumor cells from tumor initiation to full malignancy.
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, arising in the developing cerebellum ( Gilbertson and Ellison, 2008 35. Gilbertson, R.J. ∙ Ellison, D.W. The origins of medulloblastoma subtypes Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3 :341-365 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the sonic hedgehog (SHH)-activated subtype contains multiple TME cell types ( Bailey and Cushing, 1925; Wright, 1910 6. Bailey, P. ∙ Cushing, H. Medulloblastoma Cerebelli: a Common Type of Midcerebellar Glioma of Childhood Arch. Neurol. Psychiatry. 1925; 2 :192 Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar 121. Wright, J.H. Neurocytoma or Neuroblastoma, a Kind of Tumor Not Generally Recognized J. Exp. Med. 1910; 12 :556-561 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), including neurons, endothelial cells, microglia-macrophages, and astrocytes ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Intriguingly, although medulloblastoma cells proliferate uncontrollably in vivo , propagating them in vitro has been very difficult, requiring serial transplantation in the brains of immunodeficient mice to expand human medulloblastoma cells ( Shu et al., 2008 100. Shu, Q. ∙ Wong, K.K. ∙ Su, J.M. ... Direct orthotopic transplantation of fresh surgical specimen preserves CD133+ tumor cells in clinically relevant mouse models of medulloblastoma and glioma Stem Cells. 2008; 26 :1414-1424 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). A potential explanation for this apparent paradox is that medulloblastoma cells rely on supportive signals from TME cells that are absent in vitro . In fact, the presence of an astrocytic component in medulloblastoma has been linked to poor prognosis even though its origin is unclear ( Rickert and Paulus, 2005 92. Rickert, C.H. ∙ Paulus, W. Prognosis-related histomorphological and immunohistochemical markers in central nervous system tumors of childhood and adolescence Acta Neuropathol. 2005; 109 :69-92 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to the clinical importance, studying the TME in the SHH subtype of medulloblastoma, which has an ostensibly simple tumor organization, could provide critical proof-of-principle groundwork. Years of research of this tumor type ( Goodrich et al., 1997; Schüller et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008 42. Goodrich, L.V. ∙ Milenković, L. ∙ Higgins, K.M. ... Altered neural cell fates and medulloblastoma in mouse patched mutants Science. 1997; 277 :1109-1113 Crossref Scopus (1296) PubMed Google Scholar 97. Schüller, U. ∙ Heine, V.M. ∙ Mao, J. ...

Yang, Z.J. ∙ Ellis, T. ∙ Markant, S.L. ... Medulloblastoma can be initiated by deletion of Patched in lineage-restricted progenitors or stem cells Cancer Cell. 2008; 14 :135-145 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ) provide a vast amount of knowledge and well-characterized tools and techniques for this cancer type. First, the cell of origin for medulloblastoma, the granule neuron precursor (GNP), is a unipotent progenitor that does not give rise to any other cell types but granule neurons ( Figures 1 A–1C) ( Zhang and Goldman, 1996 127. Zhang, L. ∙ Goldman, J.E. Developmental fates and migratory pathways of dividing progenitors in the postnatal rat cerebellum J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 370 :536-550 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), allowing one to use granule neuron precursor (GNP)-specific Math1-Cre ( Matei et al., 2005 72. Matei, V. ∙ Pauley, S. ∙ Kaing, S. ... Smaller inner ear sensory epithelia in Neurog 1 null mice are related to earlier hair cell cycle exit Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234 :633-650 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ) to mutate and label tumor but not TME cells in a mouse model. Second, tumor GNPs can be specifically labeled by the Math1-GFP reporter transgene ( Rose et al., 2009 93. Rose, M.F. ∙ Ren, J. ∙ Ahmad, K.A. ... Math1 is essential for the development of hindbrain neurons critical for perinatal breathing Neuron. 2009; 64 :341-354 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ) to facilitate in vivo analysis and can be highly purified through Percoll gradient centrifugation for in vitro analysis ( Oliver et al., 2005 79. Oliver, T.G. ∙ Read, T.A. ∙ Kessler, J.D. ... Loss of patched and disruption of granule cell development in a pre-neoplastic stage of medulloblastoma Development. 2005; 132 :2425-2439 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, genetic mutations contributing to this tumor type have been well studied; heterozygous Ptch1 mutation leads to upregulation of SHH signaling and significant tumor risks ( Goodrich et al., 1997; Mullor et al., 2002; Pietsch et al., 1997 42. Goodrich, L.V. ∙ Milenković, L. ∙ Higgins, K.M. ...

Medulloblastomas of the desmoplastic variant carry mutations of the human homologue of Drosophila patched Cancer Res. 1997; 57 :2085-2088 PubMed Google Scholar ), and p53 loss results in a precipitous survival rate in human patients ( Tabori et al., 2010 111. Tabori, U. ∙ Baskin, B. ∙ Shago, M. ... Universal poor survival in children with medulloblastoma harboring somatic TP53 mutations J. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 28 :1345-1350 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) and shortened latency with full penetrance of tumor formation in mouse models ( Wetmore et al., 2001 118. Wetmore, C. ∙ Eberhart, D.E. ∙ Curran, T. Loss of p53 but not ARF accelerates medulloblastoma in mice heterozygous for patched Cancer Res. 2001; 61 :513-516 PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the brain is an “immune-privileged” organ in which microglia are the elementary tissue-resident macrophages and brain-specific astrocytes serve as non-professional immune cells ( Burda and Sofroniew, 2014; Colombo and Farina, 2016; Prinz et al., 2017 13. Burda, J.E. ∙ Sofroniew, M.V. Reactive gliosis and the multicellular response to CNS damage and disease Neuron. 2014; 81 :229-248 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar 19. Colombo, E. ∙ Farina, C. Astrocytes: Key Regulators of Neuroinflammation Trends Immunol. 2016; 37 :608-620 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar 87. Prinz, M. ∙ Erny, D. ∙ Hagemeyer, N. Ontogeny and homeostasis of CNS myeloid cells Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :385-392 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing a relatively simple system to decipher the interactions among cell types. As a tumor progresses, if blood-derived immune cells infiltrate into the tumor mass, as in neurological diseases or brain infections ( Harris et al., 2012; Høglund and Maghazachi, 2014 47. Harris, T.H. ∙ Banigan, E.J. ∙ Christian, D.A. ... Generalized Lévy walks and the role of chemokines in migration of effector CD8+ T cells Nature. 2012; 486 :545-548 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Høglund, R.A. ∙ Maghazachi, A.A. Multiple sclerosis and the role of immune cells World J. Exp. Med. 2014; 4 :27-37 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), then they can be readily identified for further functional studies. Here we created a MADM-based model for medulloblastoma with which we discovered an intricate TME network formed through trans -differentiation and multilateral paracrine signaling.

Section: Results

To pinpoint the contributions of diverse TME cells to the SHH-activated subtype of medulloblastoma (hereafter referred to as medulloblastoma), we established a MADM-based genetic model in which sporadic Ptch1 -heterozygous, p53 -null, GFP + GNPs were generated by Math1-Cre ( Matei et al., 2005 72. Matei, V. ∙ Pauley, S. ∙ Kaing, S. ... Smaller inner ear sensory epithelia in Neurog 1 null mice are related to earlier hair cell cycle exit Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234 :633-650 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ) in an otherwise Ptch1 -heterozygous, p53 -heterozygous mouse ( Figure 1 D). We chose Math1-Cre because it faithfully labels GNPs ( Yang et al., 2008 125. Yang, Z.J. ∙ Ellis, T. ∙ Markant, S.L. ... Medulloblastoma can be initiated by deletion of Patched in lineage-restricted progenitors or stem cells Cancer Cell. 2008; 14 :135-145 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 C) but not potential TME cell types ( Figure S1 D), enabling us to investigate the establishment and evolution of the TME throughout tumorigenesis ( Figures 1 E–1G; illustrated in Figure S1 E).
In addition to the MADM-based model ( Table S1 , model A), three slightly modified mouse models were used in this study to address specific questions. In model B, Math1-Cre and a Cre reporter ( Madisen et al., 2010 68. Madisen, L. ∙ Zwingman, T.A. ∙ Sunkin, S.M. ... A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13 :133-140 Crossref Scopus (2395) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to specifically inactivate genes in GNPs and keep track of tumor lineage even after they differentiate into other cell types. In model C, Math1-GFP ( Rose et al., 2009 93. Rose, M.F. ∙ Ren, J. ∙ Ahmad, K.A. ... Math1 is essential for the development of hindbrain neurons critical for perinatal breathing Neuron. 2009; 64 :341-354 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used as tumor cell marker to distinguish them from TME cells, and in model D, a Cre-free medulloblastoma model allowed us to designate Cre activity at desired times or in desired TME cell types for functional analysis. All of these are genetic models with an intact immune system and are free of injury-related complications common in tumor-grafting models.
Immunofluorescence-based histological analysis of tumor sections at various stages from the MADMs model revealed that all types of TME cells observed in human medulloblastoma are abundantly present ( Figures 1 H–1J). Interestingly, distinct TME cells progressed at different rates; although the coverage of CD31 + endothelial cells gradually increased as tumors progressed ( Figure 1 Hʹ), both IBA-1 + tumor-associated microglia or macrophages (TAMs) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) + astrocytes were drastically elevated at tumor onset and then remained at a constant composition throughout ( Figures 1 Iʹ and Jʹ). Because microglia and astrocytes are minimally present in the normal external granule layer (EGL), where tumor initiates ( Figures 1 Iʹ and Jʹ, first bar), their sudden and abundant presence in even the smallest tumors implies their critical importance for malignancy. Finally, compared with normal brain regions ( Figures 1 H–1J and 1N), the enlarged vessel lumen ( Figure 1 H), reduced ramification of IBA-1 + cells ( Figure 1 I), and elevated GFAP + expression ( Figure 1 J) in tumor regions collectively imply that these TME cells co-evolve with tumor cells.
To investigate the tumor-TME interactions, we closely examined the distribution of TME cells among GFP + tumor GNPs (referred to as TuGNPs hereafter) ( Figures 1 K–1M). We observed intermixed patterns of a minor population of TME cells intimately associating with tumor cells. Although endothelial cells and TAMs lacked GFP labeling ( Figures 1 K and 1L), unexpectedly, all astrocytes (GFAP + ) in the tumor mass were GFP + in every tumor examined ( Figure 1 M; Video S1 ). Because we confirmed that Math1-Cre faithfully labels GNPs but not astrocytes in normal brains ( Figure S1 D), it suggests that the GFAP + GFP + cells in medulloblastoma are likely TuGNP-derived rather than normal astrocytes.
In addition to GFAP, another marker for astrocytes, brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP), also showed overlapped staining with GFP ( Figures S1 F and S1Fʹ). Importantly, BLBP + GFP + cells were confined to the tumor region but never found in adjacent normal regions ( Figure S1 Fʹ versus Figure S1 Fʹʹ), suggesting a tumor-specific phenomenon. To further examine the nature of these cells, we established a medulloblastoma model in which the GNP lineage is labeled with tdTomato ( Table S1 , model B) and astrocytes are labeled by an astrocyte-specific Aldh1L1-GFP bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene ( Gong et al., 2003 40. Gong, S. ∙ Zheng, C. ∙ Doughty, M.L. ... A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes Nature. 2003; 425 :917-925 Crossref Scopus (1377) PubMed Google Scholar ). The observed co-expression of GFP and tdTomato ( Figure S1 G) lent further support to the astrocytic nature of these TuGNP-derived cells. Finally, we also noted a remarkable morphological resemblance of these GFAP + cells to normal astrocytes. Phenocopying Bergmann glia in normal cerebellum ( Figure 1 N), a radial arrangement of GFP + GFAP fibers was highly evident at the edge of early- to mid-stage tumors ( Figures 1 O and 1P). Additionally, GFP-labeled astrocyte-like cells intimately associated with blood vessels throughout tumor regions ( Figures 1 Q and 1R), reminiscent of another salient feature of normal astrocytes ( Abbott et al., 2006; Iadecola and Nedergaard, 2007 1. Abbott, N.J. ∙ Rönnbäck, L. ∙ Hansson, E. Astrocyte-endothelial interactions at the blood-brain barrier Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7 :41-53 Crossref Scopus (2690) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Iadecola, C. ∙ Nedergaard, M. Glial regulation of the cerebral microvasculature Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10 :1369-1376 Crossref Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ). In summary, the cellular resolution provided by MADMs not only revealed the co-evolution process of TME cells during tumor progression but also led to an unexpected finding of potential trans -differentiation of TuGNPs to astrocytes.
Although intrigued, we are acutely aware of alternative interpretations of the observed trans -differentiation. One possibility is promoter leakage. Although Math1-Cre faithfully labels GNPs in the normal brain, the Math1 promoter could be mis-activated in astrocytes after they are recruited into the tumor mass. Although this possibility cannot be ruled out by conventional Cre reporters, it was readily excluded by the dual-color design of MADMs because promoter leakage would result in yellow astrocytes (illustrated in Figure 2 A), which were never observed in all tumors ( Figures 2 B and 2Bʹ). The possibility of cell fusion between astrocytes and GFP-labeled TuGNPs was ruled out because we never observed binucleated cells after examining more than 1,000 BLBP + GFP + cells from 10 individual tumors ( Figure S2 A). Just in case nuclei fused after cell fusion, resulting in single-nucleus fused cells, we established a medulloblastoma model in which all GNPs are labeled with GFP ( Table S1 , model D) and all astrocytes are labeled with tdTomato ( Figure S2 B) to capture events based on the generation of yellow cells (illustrated in Figure S2 C). The fact that yellow TME astrocytes were never observed after examining more than 100 tdTomato + cells in 4 tumor-bearing mice ( Figure S2 D) definitively ruled out the possibility of cell fusion. Finally, we ruled out the possibility of GFP protein transfer from TuGNPs to astrocytes because in model C ( Table S1 ), all astrocytes were GFP-negative even though all tumor cells were labeled by Math1-GFP (data not shown).
To pinpoint the identity of these “astrocyte-like” cells more definitively, we profiled their transcriptome using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) followed by RNA sequencing. To visualize target cells in the tumor mass without immunostaining, we used a mouse model in which TuGNPs are red, tumor-derived astrocyte-like cells are yellow, and normal astrocytes are green ( Figure S2 E, model B). After extensive optimization of the tissue-processing procedure to avoid diffusive loss of fluorescent proteins in unfixed tissue ( Singh et al., 2019; Wang and Janes, 2013 102. Singh, S. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Schaff, D.L. ... In situ 10-cell RNA sequencing in tissue and tumor biopsy samples Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :4836 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 116. Wang, L. ∙ Janes, K.A. Stochastic profiling of transcriptional regulatory heterogeneities in tissues, tumors and cultured cells Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :282-301 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 F; STAR Methods ), we were able to visualize both GFP and tdTomato and collected ∼250 astrocyte-like cells from each tumor sample. After extracting RNA, amplifying cDNA ( Janes et al., 2010; Wang and Janes, 2013 54. Janes, K.A. ∙ Wang, C.C. ∙ Holmberg, K.J. ... Identifying single-cell molecular programs by stochastic profiling Nat. Methods. 2010; 7 :311-317 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar 116. Wang, L. ∙ Janes, K.A. Stochastic profiling of transcriptional regulatory heterogeneities in tissues, tumors and cultured cells Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :282-301 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), and confirming the purity of LCM-collected astrocyte-like cells, TuGNPs, and normal cerebellar astrocytes ( Figures S2 G and S2H), we performed RNA sequencing followed by unsupervised clustering of transcriptomic profiles (n = 4 each). We found that astrocyte-like tumor cells clustered more closely to normal astrocytes than to TuGNPs ( Figure 2 C). Notably, almost all of the TuGNP-specific transcripts were downregulated in astrocyte-like cells ( Figures 2 C, top, and 2 D, bottom), whereas many astrocyte-specific transcripts were upregulated ( Figures 2 C, bottom, and 2 D, top), suggesting extensive trans -differentiation. Because the astrocyte-like cells closely resemble but still differ from normal astrocytes in ∼2,500 uniquely expressed transcripts ( Figure 2 C, center), here we refer to them as “TuAstrocytes.”
Finally we investigated with two approaches whether the astrocytic component long recognized in human medulloblastomas ( Burger et al., 1987; Mannoji et al., 1981 14.

First we assessed whether patient-derived medulloblastoma cells could trans -differentiate into astrocytes in xenografts. To avoid culture-induced artifacts, we used a primary human SHH-subgroup medulloblastoma that has been serially xenografted into the brains of nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice and authenticated by gene expression profiling along the passages ( Shu et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2012 100.

Zhao, X. ∙ Liu, Z. ∙ Yu, L. ... Global gene expression profiling confirms the molecular fidelity of primary tumor-based orthotopic xenograft mouse models of medulloblastoma Neuro-oncol. 2012; 14 :574-583 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). We consistently observed human GFAP-specific immunoreactivity within all xenografted tumors examined ( Figures S2 I and S2J). Because these tumor cells had been grafted through multiple passages to eliminate non-tumor cells, these human GFAP + cells most likely were trans -differentiated from TuGNPs. For our second approach, we exploited the fact that the PTCH1 locus on chromosome 9q in the human genome is recurrently lost in human desmoplastic medulloblastoma ( Schofield et al., 1995 96. Schofield, D. ∙ West, D.C. ∙ Anthony, D.C. ... Correlation of loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 9q with histological subtype in medulloblastomas Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146 :472-480 PubMed Google Scholar ). We predicted that, if astrocytes in the tumor were not lineage-related to tumor cells, then they would have a normal karyotype ( Figure 2 E, left), whereas, if astrocytes are lineage-related to tumor cells, then astrocytes would have the identical chromosomal loss as surrounding tumor cells ( Figure 2 E, right). Among 21 cases of SHH-activated subtype human medulloblastoma, six were identified with 9q loss that warranted further study. We assessed the chromosomal integrity in each astrocyte within the tumor mass by two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for PTCH1 ( 9q22.33 ) and an adjacent locus ( 9q21.33 ) along with immunofluorescent staining of GFAP. To ensure that these patients are not germline carriers for this karyotypic aberration, which would confound data interpretation, we verified that many endothelial cells in the tumor mass had a normal karyotype ( Figure 2 F). The fact that GFAP + cells had significant enrichment for monoallelic PTCH1-9q21.33 loss to the same level as tumor cells ( Figure 2 G) in six of six cases (summarized in Figure 2 H) suggests that these astrocytes share a common lineage with tumor cells harboring the same genetic lesion.
After exhaustively examining all conceivable alternative interpretations, we concluded that TuAstrocytes in the TME are derived from TuGNPs in both mouse models and human medulloblastoma patients.
To determine the function of TuAstrocytes, we first sought to determine whether TuAstrocytes display cancer stem cell characteristics because GFAP is a marker gene for not only astrocytes but also neural stem cells ( Doetsch et al., 1999 25. Doetsch, F. ∙ Caillé, I. ∙ Lim, D.A. ... Subventricular zone astrocytes are neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain Cell. 1999; 97 :703-716 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2963) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the purification of viable TuAstrocytes was not feasible (data not shown), we established a mouse medulloblastoma model in which TuAstrocytes are labeled with RFP upon tamoxifen injection ( Figure 3 A, model D), with an expectation to find RFP + TuGNPs after an extended period if TuAstrocytes function as cancer stem cells. However, no red TuGNPs were observed 2 weeks after Tamoxifen injection ( Figure 3 B). In case more time was needed for TuAstrocytes to give rise to TuGNPs, we transplanted unlabeled primary tumors from this model into NOD-SCID mice, administered tamoxifen after tumors started growing, and waited 2 months. The fact that we still did not observe any RFP + TuGNPs ( Figure 3 C) does not support a cancer stem cell role of TuAstrocytes.
Next, we probed tumor-supporting roles of TuAstrocytes with two experiments. First, we examined the correlation between the presence of TuAstrocytes and the progression of pre-neoplastic lesions (PNLs) ( Oliver et al., 2005 79. Oliver, T.G. ∙ Read, T.A. ∙ Kessler, J.D. ... Loss of patched and disruption of granule cell development in a pre-neoplastic stage of medulloblastoma Development. 2005; 132 :2425-2439 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), of which only some progress to full malignancy. After identifying PNLs on the surface of the cerebellum in Ptch1 +/− mice at post-natal day 35 (P35), we assessed correlation between overall content of astrocytes and the proliferative status of GNPs ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Across more than 30 PNLs, we found that the presence of astrocytes strongly correlated with GNP proliferation and vice versa (p < 10 −5 , Fisher’s exact test; Figure S3 C), suggesting that astrocytes might play important roles in PNL progression. Second, when purified TuGNPs were cultured in vitro , we observed that, although dispersed cells stopped proliferating quickly, those aggregating cells showed robust proliferation ( Figure S3 D). To investigate whether TuAstrocytes were involved, we prepared RFP + TuGNPs from the Aldh1L1-GFP model used for the LCM experiment ( Figure S2 E, model B). Although all cells were red initially, GFP + TuAstrocytes started to appear in aggregates as early as day 3 in culture ( Figures S3 E and S3G) and increased substantially by day 6 ( Figures S3 F and S3G), indicating concurrence between spontaneous TuGNP-to-TuAstrocyte trans -differentiation and sphere expansion in culture. Taken together, we conclude that TuAstrocytes are not cancer stem cells but, rather likely, play a supportive role regarding TuGNPs.
Next, we asked how TuAstrocytes might promote tumor progression by examining a panel of eight growth factors known to be important for brain development and tumor progression. First we performed qRT-PCR to compare their expression levels in tumors and normal brains, hypothesizing that candidate factors should consistently be expressed at higher levels in tumors. We identified three candidate factors—insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A)—that were consistently 2-fold or more higher in tumors ( Figure 4 A). To distinguish TME-derived from tumor-intrinsic factors, we performed paired qRT-PCR of these three factors between the tumor mass and purified TuGNPs and found that IGF1 and HGF, but not PDGF-A, were TME-derived factors ( Figure 4 B). Next, we found that IGF1, but not HGF, promoted the proliferation of TuGNPs in cell culture in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Finally, the importance of IGF1 in human medulloblastoma was supported by IGF1-dependent proliferation of a human SHH medulloblastoma line ( Shu et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2012 100. Shu, Q. ∙ Wong, K.K. ∙ Su, J.M. ... Direct orthotopic transplantation of fresh surgical specimen preserves CD133+ tumor cells in clinically relevant mouse models of medulloblastoma and glioma Stem Cells. 2008; 26 :1414-1424 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar 129.

Global gene expression profiling confirms the molecular fidelity of primary tumor-based orthotopic xenograft mouse models of medulloblastoma Neuro-oncol. 2012; 14 :574-583 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 E).
To determine whether IGF1 signaling is critical for medulloblastoma progression, which is well known for its reliance on Shh signaling ( Goodrich et al., 1997; Mullor et al., 2002; Pietsch et al., 1997 42. Goodrich, L.V. ∙ Milenković, L. ∙ Higgins, K.M. ... Altered neural cell fates and medulloblastoma in mouse patched mutants Science. 1997; 277 :1109-1113 Crossref Scopus (1296) PubMed Google Scholar 75. Mullor, J.L. ∙ Sánchez, P. ∙ Ruiz i Altaba, A. Pathways and consequences: Hedgehog signaling in human disease Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12 :562-569 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 85. Pietsch, T. ∙ Waha, A. ∙ Koch, A. ... Medulloblastomas of the desmoplastic variant carry mutations of the human homologue of Drosophila patched Cancer Res. 1997; 57 :2085-2088 PubMed Google Scholar ), we established a mouse model in which IGF1R is genetically deleted specifically in GNPs ( Figure S4 A, model C plus IGF1R-flox alleles, hereafter referred to as insulin growth factor 1 receptor-conditional knockout [IGF1R-CKO]). We found that IGF1R is critical for both tumor initiation ( Figures S4 B and S4C) and progression ( Figure 4 F) because tumor sizes were much smaller in IGF1R-CKO mice compared with the control group at both stages. IGF1R-CKO mice survived much longer than IGF1R-WT and IGF1R-heterozygous mice ( Figure 4 G). Histological examination of brains at the study endpoint (P130) revealed few tumor cells in IGF1R-CKO brains, indicating the indispensable role of IGF1R signaling in medulloblastoma. It should be noted that, because Math1-Cre is expressed throughout GNP development, the lack of tumor formation in this model could be caused by developmental defects of GNPs upon IGF1R inactivation. To rule out this possibility, we established another mouse model in which IGF1R deletion is mediated by tamoxifen-dependent Math1-CreER ( Figure 4 H, model D). After confirming that tamoxifen had no effect on tumor progression ( Figure S4 D), we injected tamoxifen to inactivate IGF1R in TuGNPs after tumor formation (P40). The reduction of tumor size in tamoxifen-treated mice in comparison with vehicle controls ( Figures 4 I and 4J) suggests that acute inactivation of IGF1 signaling in TuGNPs halted tumor progression. To probe the cause of the tumor size reduction, we further examined the apoptotic index and cell cycle exit index of TuGNPs (illustrated in Figure S4 E) and found that IGF1R-null TuGNPs are much more likely to die and exit the cell cycle than IGF1R-WT TuGNPs ( Figures S4 F–S4I).
In summary, these data suggest that TME-derived IGF1 signaling is critical not only for initiation but also for sustained progression of medulloblastoma.
Because TuAstrocytes are trans -differentiated from TuGNPs, we established a complementary mouse model to inactivate IGF1 with Math1-Cre (model C plus IGF1-flox alleles), expecting it to phenocopy the IGF1R knockout model. Surprisingly, the IGF1 knockout (KO) model failed to slow tumor progression, leading to our suspicion that TuAstrocytes might not be the cellular source of IGF1. Using RNA in situ hybridization to detect IGF1 and immunofluorescent staining to identify cell types, we found that IGF1 is specifically produced by IBA-1 + tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMs) but not TuAstrocytes ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Interestingly, although ∼70% of TAMs were IGF1 + , no detectable IGF1 was seen in microglia in normal brain regions (normal versus tumor region, Figure 5 A, center; quantified in Figure 5 C). After affinity-based purification of TAMs and microglia, we further verified by qRT-PCR that the expression level of IGF1 is more than an order of magnitude greater in TAMs than in normal microglia ( Figure 5 D). Co-culturing purified TAMs and TuGNPs showed that TAMs promoted TuGNP proliferation in a density-dependent manner ( Figures 5 E and 5F), which is IGF1-dependent because the IGF1-sequestering protein IGFBP3 ( Ranke, 2015 91. Ranke, M.B. Insulin-like growth factor binding-protein-3 (IGFBP-3) Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 29 :701-711 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) completely abrogated the tumor-supporting activity of TAMs ( Figure 5 G, column 3 versus column 2). To investigate the role of TAM-secreted IGF1 in vivo , we established another medulloblastoma model in which IGF1 is inactivated by myeloid-specific CSF1R-Cre ( Deng et al., 2010 22. Deng, L. ∙ Zhou, J.F. ∙ Sellers, R.S. ... A novel mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease links mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent hyperproliferation of colonic epithelium to inflammation-associated tumorigenesis Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176 :952-967 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 H, model D). We found that TAM-specific deletion of IGF1 resulted in much smaller tumors at P35 compared with tumors under IGF1-WT conditions ( Figures 5 I and 5J, n > 10), suggesting a supportive role of IGF1 from TAMs in tumor initiation.
Why do most TAMs but few normal microglia express IGF1? One possible explanation could be their distinct origins. Derived from the embryonic yolk sac and shaped by the brain environment, microglia are intrinsically different from macrophages derived from circulating monocytes ( Ginhoux et al., 2010; Goldmann et al., 2016; Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015; Gosselin et al., 2014 36. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ...

Environment drives selection and function of enhancers controlling tissue-specific macrophage identities Cell. 2014; 159 :1327-1340 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the elevated IGF1 expression in TAMs could mean that TAMs originated from circulating-monocyte derived macrophages, especially because we noted that TAMs had morphologies highly distinct from resident microglia ( Figures S5 A–S5F). Our initial attempt to pinpoint the origin of TAMs based on their marker expression was unsuccessful because of its puzzling pattern. Although they stained positively for the microglia marker P2RY12 ( Butovsky et al., 2014 15. Butovsky, O. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ∙ Moore, C.S. ... Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :131-143 Crossref Scopus (936) PubMed Google Scholar ), they also expressed the monocyte-derived macrophage marker CCR2 ( Kurihara et al., 1997; Siebert et al., 2000 59. Kurihara, T. ∙ Warr, G. ∙ Loy, J. ... Defects in macrophage recruitment and host defense in mice lacking the CCR2 chemokine receptor J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186 :1757-1762 Crossref Scopus (496) PubMed Google Scholar 101. Siebert, H. ∙ Sachse, A. ∙ Kuziel, W.A. ... The chemokine receptor CCR2 is involved in macrophage recruitment to the injured peripheral nervous system J. Neuroimmunol. 2000; 110 :177-185 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S5 G and S5H). Even more puzzling was the lack of expression of TMEM119 ( Figure S5 I), which has been shown previously to remain stable in microglia even in the presence of brain inflammation and injuries ( Bennett et al., 2016 9. Bennett, M.L. ∙ Bennett, F.C. ∙ Liddelow, S.A. ... New tools for studying microglia in the mouse and human CNS Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E1738-E1746 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these efforts turned out to be inconclusive, they nevertheless revealed a strong influence of TME factors on TAM states.
Next, we turned to a lineage tracing method to distinguish microglia from monocyte-derived macrophages. Using this approach, initially labeled monocytes would be replaced by unlabeled monocytes derived from stem cells because of their fast turnover, but microglia would remain labeled because of slow and local replenishment ( Figure 6 A; Goldmann et al., 2013; Yona et al., 2013 37. Goldmann, T. ∙ Wieghofer, P. ∙ Müller, P.F. ... A new type of microglia gene targeting shows TAK1 to be pivotal in CNS autoimmune inflammation Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16 :1618-1626 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar 126. Yona, S. ∙ Kim, K.W. ∙ Wolf, Y. ... Fate mapping reveals origins and dynamics of monocytes and tissue macrophages under homeostasis Immunity. 2013; 38 :79-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1139) PubMed Google Scholar ). We carefully re-validated the system to rule out possible interference by genetic mutations in the medulloblastoma model ( Figure S6 ). To avoid the slim possibility that monocytes labeled in early tumor lesions lodging in the tumor mass might fail to turn over, we injected tamoxifen at P7, long before tumor initiation. When we examined brain sections at P40, when tumors were still small, and at P60, when tumors fully developed, we found that all TAMs in the tumor mass were labeled by tdTomato, suggesting that they originated from the microglia ( Figures 6 B–6E). Complementary to the lineage tracing experiment, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of purified TAMs followed by hierarchical cluster analysis also indicated that TAMs shared more transcriptomic similarity with microglia than with circulating monocyte-derived macrophages ( Figures 6 F and 6G). Notably, TAMs displayed significant alterations of gene expression compared with normal microglia and demonstrated even greater deviation from normal microglia than LPS-treated microglia ( Figure 6 G), suggesting that they were heavily shaped by local TME factors. Finally, in addition to microglia, one recent paper reported that meningeal macrophages also turn over slowly ( Goldmann et al., 2016 38. Goldmann, T. ∙ Wieghofer, P. ∙ Jordão, M.J. ... Origin, fate and dynamics of macrophages at central nervous system interfaces Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :797-805 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could also be a source of labeled TAMs. Dextran dye labeling of meningeal macrophages ( Figures 6 H and 6I) followed by 3 and 7 days of monitoring did not detect infiltration ( Figures 6 J and 6K) suggested that meningeal macrophages are unlikely to be a significant source of TAMs. Taken together, these data suggest that TAMs originate from microglia and undergo significant morphological and functional changes that are likely induced by TME factors.
Because TAMs originate from microglia that normally do not express high levels of IGF1, we pursued the hypothesis that IGF1 expression in TAMs is caused by alteration of their immune state induced by TME factors. We first performed comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data of TAMs in comparison with normal microglia with a focus on tolerogenic signature genes ( Chanmee et al., 2014 16. Chanmee, T. ∙ Ontong, P. ∙ Konno, K. ... Tumor-associated macrophages as major players in the tumor microenvironment Cancers (Basel). 2014; 6 :1670-1690 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ) demonstrated previously to promote tumorigenesis ( Noy and Pollard, 2014 78. Noy, R. ∙ Pollard, J.W. Tumor-associated macrophages: from mechanisms to therapy Immunity. 2014; 41 :49-61 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1239) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among 4,898 upregulated and 4,521 downregulated genes, we found an overall tolerogenic signature, including a bias toward IL-10 production, negative regulation of adaptive immunity, negative regulation of inflammatory responses, factors associated with Th2 immunity, and IL-4-mediated signaling events ( Figure S7 A).
Next, we examined two pathways that are best known for IGF1-induction in macrophages/microglia: IL-4 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) ( Fournier et al., 1995; Lake et al., 1994; Spadaro et al., 2017; Wynes and Riches, 2003 30.

Induction of macrophage insulin-like growth factor-I expression by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 J. Immunol. 2003; 171 :3550-3559 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that genes in the IL-4 pathway are globally elevated in TAMs, especially those elicited in a STAT6-dependent manner ( Figure 7 A). In support of this finding, we observed a significant increase in differentially expressed genes regulated by IL-4-related kinases in macrophages, including JAK2 and ERK1-ERK2 ( Figure S7 B). On the contrary, genes known to be elicited in macrophages stimulated with TNF-α were generally downregulated, including genes dependent on TNF-α signaling via nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and AP1 ( Figure 7 B, blue bars), whereas genes that are thought to be suppressed by TNF-α were upregulated ( Figure 7 B, red bar). These findings are in accordance with our Luminex profiling data, which indicated an increase in IL-4 but not TNF-α in the tumor mass ( Figure 7 C; Table S2 ). To investigate the functional relevance, we purified TAMs from the tumor mass and demonstrated a significant increase in IGF1 expression upon IL-4 stimulation ( Figure 7 D). In a complementary experiment, we established a mouse medulloblastoma model with an IL-4-null background ( Figure S7 C, model C). Although IL-4 KO did not alter the number of TAMs in the tumor mass ( Figure 7 E; Figure S7 D), it led to a significant decrease in IGF1 expression in the tumor mass ( Figure 7 F). Therefore, this set of experiments indicated that IL-4 is sufficient and necessary to promote IGF1 expression in TAMs.
Finally, we set out to determine the cellular source of IL-4. Because it is known that Th2 lymphocytes are the major source of IL-4 ( Bradding et al., 1992; Le Gros et al., 1990; Swain et al., 1990 12. Bradding, P. ∙ Feather, I.H. ∙ Howarth, P.H. ...

Immunol. 1990; 145 :3796-3806 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we first comprehensively catalog the immune cell types in the TME after carefully removing immune cells in blood vessels with intracardiac perfusion with PBS. Our data indicated that more than 98% of CD45 + immune cells in medulloblastoma were positive for the myeloid marker CD11b ( Figure 7 G). Considering the possibility of CD11b expression in activated T and B lymphocytes ( Christensen et al., 2001; Ghosn et al., 2008; Kawai et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2001 17.

Mature resting Ly6C(high) natural killer cells can be reactivated by IL-15 Eur. J. Immunol. 2014; 44 :2638-2647 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), we performed further flow cytometry analysis for T cells (CD3), B cells (CD19), and NK cells (NK1.1). This analysis ( Figure 7 H), along with the lack of immunostaining of the T cell marker CD3 in the tumor mass ( Figures S7 E and S7F), indicated that only negligible numbers of T, B, and NK cells were present within the tumor mass. This finding corroborates well with reports in the literature that the predominant immune component in human medulloblastoma is CD11b + myeloid cells ( Margol et al., 2015; Rossi et al., 1991 70. Margol, A.S. ∙ Robison, N.J. ∙ Gnanachandran, J. ... Tumor-associated macrophages in SHH subgroup of medulloblastomas Clin.

The monocyte/macrophage infiltrate in 35 medulloblastomas: a paraffin-wax study Tumori. 1991; 77 :36-40 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, the lack of infiltrated T cells led us to postulate that, rather than Th2 lymphocytes, other TME cells must be the source of IL-4.
We performed in situ analysis for IL-4 together with immunostaining for cell-type-specific markers to identify IL-4-producing cells. To our surprise, we identified GFAP + astrocytes as the major source of IL-4 ( Figures 7 I and 7Iʹ). To investigate whether IL-4 is produced by normal or tumor-derived astrocytes, we established a mouse model that incorporates both a tumor lineage marker (tdTomato) and an IL-4-GFP reporter transgene ( Mohrs et al., 2001 74. Mohrs, M. ∙ Shinkai, K. ∙ Mohrs, K. ... Analysis of type 2 immunity in vivo with a bicistronic IL-4 reporter Immunity. 2001; 15 :303-311 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ‘ model B, illustrated in Figure S7 G) and found that all IL-4-GFP + cells expressed both GFAP and tdTomato, suggesting that IL-4 is specifically produced by TuAstrocytes rather than normal astrocytes ( Figures 7 J and 7K; Figure S7 H).

Section: Discussion

Through comprehensive lineage tracing, molecular profiling, and functional studies, we demonstrated that TME components in ostensibly simple medulloblastoma form an intricate network to support tumor progression ( Figure 7 L). Our work clearly illustrates the importance of studying co-evolution of the TME and tumor cells at high spatiotemporal resolution using immunocompetent, injury-free genetic models and exemplifies how tumor plasticity contributes to cellular heterogeneity in the tumor mass and how multiple TME cells form a local community to promote tumor progression.
The importance of TME for tumor progression has been well supported by a wealth of reports ( Balkwill et al., 2012; Hanahan and Coussens, 2012; Quail and Joyce, 2013 7.

Although tumor angiogenesis was the initial focus ( Folkman, 1971 29. Folkman, J. Tumor angiogenesis: therapeutic implications N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285 :1182-1186 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), other TME cells, including fibroblasts, immune cells, and other tissue-resident cells, quickly took the stage ( Binnewies et al., 2018; Gascard and Tlsty, 2016; Kalluri, 2016; Shiga et al., 2015; Tabuso et al., 2017 11.

To develop novel cancer treatment strategies that target the TME, one must thoroughly study the establishment and functions of the TME with greater attention to time, space, cell lineage, as well as homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions. Therefore, it is imperative to use high-resolution in vivo tools to delineate hierarchical organizations, reprogramming potentials, as well as clonal behaviors within the TME. The Confetti mouse is an example of such a tool that allows lineage tracing of multiple clones in vivo , which revealed not only the neutral competition mechanism of intestinal crypt homeostasis ( Snippert et al., 2010 103. Snippert, H.J. ∙ van der Flier, L.G. ∙ Sato, T. ... Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells Cell. 2010; 143 :134-144 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (993) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also how cancer stem cells maintain tumor architecture to sustain intestinal adenomas ( Schepers et al., 2012 95.

Lineage tracing reveals Lgr5+ stem cell activity in mouse intestinal adenomas Science. 2012; 337 :730-735 Crossref Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, the MADMs system is more suitable for dual-lineage analysis of the fate of one mutant and one WT cell from the same progenitor cell ( Zong et al., 2005 131. Zong, H. ∙ Espinosa, J.S. ∙ Su, H.H. ... Mosaic analysis with double markers in mice Cell. 2005; 121 :479-492 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although previous applications of MADMs were focused on cell-autonomous gene functions in cancer ( Gonzalez et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2011; Muzumdar et al., 2007 41. Gonzalez, P.P. ∙ Kim, J. ∙ Galvao, R.P. ... p53 and NF 1 loss plays distinct but complementary roles in glioma initiation and progression Glia. 2018; 66 :999-1015 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar 65.

Mosaic analysis with double markers reveals tumor cell of origin in glioma Cell. 2011; 146 :209-221 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar 76. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Luo, L. ∙ Zong, H. Modeling sporadic loss of heterozygosity in mice by using mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :4495-4500 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), this study took advantage of its lineage-tracing capability to uncover tumor-TME relationships. The fact that such complexity of interactions could be unveiled from an ostensibly “simple” cancer further emphasizes the importance of untangling the inner works of the TME in more complex tumors.
Relying on the lineage tracing capability of MADMs, we unexpectedly discovered the phenomenon of tumor-to-TME trans -differentiation. Fully aware of potential technical caveats, we painstakingly and exhaustively pursued all imaginable alternative explanations to exclude the possibility of cell fusion, protein transfer, ectopic Cre expression, and mis-expression of cell markers. Most importantly, karyotyping-based analysis of human medulloblastoma samples also demonstrated a lineage relationship between tumor GNPs and the astrocyte-like component in the tumor mass. The complementary nature between mouse genetics and human sample analysis greatly strengthens our confidence regarding this finding.
It should be noted that, although differentiation of tumor cells into other cell types has been reported before, the novelty of our findings lies within two aspects. First, trans -differentiation from GNPs to astrocytes has to overcome significant barriers within the developmental program because the GNP pool and astrocyte-producing neural stem cell pool are segregated temporally (from embryonic day 9.5 [E9.5] on during mouse embryonic development) and spatially (GNPs reside in the EGL on the surface of the cerebellar primordium, whereas neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in the ventricular zone, the innermost layer of the neural tube at the fourth ventricle). Second, although the functional contribution of trans -differentiated TuAstrocytes was unveiled in this study, it remains to be seen whether transdifferentiated cells in other tumor types also play such a significant functional role.
Still, there are many unanswered questions. First, what is the mechanism of trans -differentiation? Second, how is the ∼1% composition of TuAstrocytes maintained throughout tumor progression? Finally, although we observed tantalizing hints of direct support of TuAstrocytes regarding tumor progression ( Figures S3 D–S3G), our study took an unexpected turn toward the discovery of the TuAstrocyte-TAM-tumor cell network. In the future, it will be important to investigate the direct supportive factors from TuAstrocytes toward tumor cells as well as to explore their role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance because SHH-subtype medulloblastoma displayed little BBB disruption, in stark contrast to the Wnt-activated subtype ( Phoenix et al., 2016 84. Phoenix, T.N. ∙ Patmore, D.M. ∙ Boop, S. ... Medulloblastoma Genotype Dictates Blood Brain Barrier Phenotype Cancer Cell. 2016; 29 :508-522 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although our study discovered an anti-inflammatory immune network formed by TuAstrocytes and microglia in medulloblastoma, in other situations, microglia and astrocytes mutually activate each other to establish a pro-inflammatory environment ( Liddelow et al., 2017; Vainchtein et al., 2018 63. Liddelow, S.A. ∙ Guttenplan, K.A. ∙ Clarke, L.E. ... Neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are induced by activated microglia Nature. 2017; 541 :481-487 Crossref Scopus (1092) PubMed Google Scholar 113.

Astrocyte-derived interleukin-33 promotes microglial synapse engulfment and neural circuit development Science. 2018; 359 :1269-1273 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is conceivable that one could re-polarize TuAstrocytes and TAMs if the proper conditions can be identified. Of course, such efforts must be grounded in the appreciation that microglia have a developmental origin distinct from macrophages ( Ginhoux et al., 2010; Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015 36. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ...

Tissue-resident macrophages originate from yolk-sac-derived erythro-myeloid progenitors Nature. 2015; 518 :547-551 Crossref Scopus (707) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tend to only mount subdued immune responses when aggravated ( Bennett et al., 2016, 2018; Bennett et al., 2016; Gosselin et al., 2014, 2017 9.

In addition to activating the innate immune system in the brain, attracting adaptive immune cells into the brain parenchyma, as found in neurological diseases, could facilitate brain tumor treatment ( Baruch et al., 2013; Filiano et al., 2015; Hemmer et al., 2015 8. Baruch, K. ∙ Ron-Harel, N. ∙ Gal, H. ... CNS-specific immunity at the choroid plexus shifts toward destructive Th2 inflammation in brain aging Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although many checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapy clinical trials for brain tumors are currently underway ( https://clinicaltrials.gov ), limited success ( Filley et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2017 28. Filley, A.C. ∙ Henriquez, M. ∙ Dey, M. Recurrent glioma clinical trial, CheckMate-143: the game is not over yet Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :91779-91794 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar 124.

Oncol. 2017; 10 :81 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) emphasizes the need to carefully consider the unique immunological environment of the brain. Although infiltration of T cells has been reported previously in a glioma model ( Quail et al., 2016 89. Quail, D.F. ∙ Bowman, R.L. ∙ Akkari, L. ... The tumor microenvironment underlies acquired resistance to CSF-1R inhibition in gliomas Science. 2016; 352 :aad3018 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), few T, B, or NK cells were found in our medulloblastoma model, which is in concordance with previous findings in human medulloblastoma samples ( Margol et al., 2015; Rossi et al., 1991 70. Margol, A.S. ∙ Robison, N.J. ∙ Gnanachandran, J. ... Tumor-associated macrophages in SHH subgroup of medulloblastomas Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21 :1457-1465 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar 94. Rossi, M.L. ∙ Buller, J.R. ∙ Heath, S.A. ... The monocyte/macrophage infiltrate in 35 medulloblastomas: a paraffin-wax study Tumori. 1991; 77 :36-40 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Although this difference could be attributed either to different tumor types or to graft-induced injuries in the previous model, the possible absence of T cells nevertheless raises concern regarding the effectiveness of T cell-based immunotherapy for brain tumors. Even when T cells reach the tumor mass, critical cytokines for T cells, such as IL-2 and IL-15. were too low in our medulloblastoma model ( Table S2 ) to support their survival. This finding corroborates well with recent clinical research demonstrating that the presence of cytotoxic T cells had no correlation with overall survival of medulloblastoma patients ( Vermeulen et al., 2017 114. Vermeulen, J.F. ∙ Van Hecke, W. ∙ Adriaansen, E.J.M. ... Prognostic relevance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immune checkpoints in pediatric medulloblastoma OncoImmunology. 2017; 7 :e1398877 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that T cell exhaustion is extremely severe in glioma ( Woroniecka et al., 2018 120. Woroniecka, K. ∙ Chongsathidkiet, P. ∙ Rhodin, K. ... T-Cell Exhaustion Signatures Vary with Tumor Type and Are Severe in Glioblastoma Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :4175-4186 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Last but not least, one must take into consideration the fact that the brain is extremely sensitive to chemical and electrical imbalances and could be severely harmed by a cytokine storm or other overt immunological responses. Therefore, the efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapy in brain tumors will only manifest after we develop a firm grasp of neuro-immunology ( Binnewies et al., 2018 11. Binnewies, M. ∙ Roberts, E.W. ∙ Kersten, K. ... Understanding the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for effective therapy Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :541-550 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although detailed molecular mechanisms warrant further exploration, our study clearly revealed an under-appreciated complexity of TME organization in medulloblastoma. Rather than one-on-one TME-tumor crosstalk, our data uncovered an intricate TME community in which trans -differentiation and a multilateral paracrine network support robust growth of tumor cells. It should be noted that, Although signaling plasticity could partially explain the problem of therapeutic resistance in cancer, cellular plasticity and multi-cell networks could also contribute to tumor robustness. For example, an elegant modeling work demonstrated that a two-cell circuitry with reciprocally supportive paracrine factors could form a stable system to maintain tissue homeostasis that can withstand perturbations ( Zhou et al., 2018 130. Zhou, X. ∙ Franklin, R.A. ∙ Adler, M. ... Circuit design features of a stable two-cell system Cell. 2018; 172 :744-757 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conceivably, the three-cell system in medulloblastoma opens up even more channels of paracrine communication and would likely withstand severe perturbations during cancer therapy. Although this study was focused on the SHH subtype of medulloblastoma, it showcases a powerful technical platform that can be applied to deconstruct the TME network within other cancer types ( Binnewies et al., 2018; Palucka and Coussens, 2016 11. Binnewies, M. ∙ Roberts, E.W. ∙ Kersten, K. ... Understanding the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for effective therapy Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :541-550 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar 82. Palucka, A.K. ∙ Coussens, L.M. The Basis of oncoimmunology Cell. 2016; 164 :1233-1247 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). The deepened understanding of TME-tumor cell relationships carries great promise for paradigm-shifting therapeutic strategies to cut off multiple paracrine crosstalks to fundamentally undermine the robustness of cancer.

Aldh1L1-GFP was ordered from Genesat (MMRRC# 011015-UCD) ( Heintz, 2004 48. Heintz, N. Gene expression nervous system atlas (GENSAT) Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7 :483 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). For all in vivo experiments, the ages of mice were indicated in figures or figure legends. Mice were separated into experimental groups on the basis of genotype and age. Female and male mice were used for all experiments to exclude gender effects. All animal procedures, including housing conditions and husbandry routines were performed according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Virginia. Statistical tests were used to predetermine sample size of tumor mice. All mice are healthy, immune-competent except for genetic mutatations introduced for experimental purposes. Prior to experiments, they were not involved in previous procedures and remained durg- and test-naive.
To test distinct hypotheses, in total we used ∼10 mouse models in this study, which were derived from 4 basic models depicted in Table S1 .
For adult mice, tamoxifen citrate tablets (20 mg/tablet; Mylan) were ground and dissolved in saline at 20 mg/ml and delivered via oral gavage.
To obtain the tumor weight, tumor-bearing mice were sacked at corresponding age. Tumor tissues (GFP+) was carefully dissected out under fluorescence microscopy and weighed by analytical balances.
Tumor or normal cerebellum tissues were dissected out and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue pieces were then ground up and lysed in Tissue Extraction Reagent I (Life Technologies) supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. The protein concentration of the lysate was determined by Pierce TM BCA protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). All samples were adjusted to 1mg/ml with Tissue Extraction Reagent I and submitted to UVA Flow Cytometry Core Facility to run a 32-plex cytokine/chemokine/growth factor panel on Luminex MAGPIX system. This 32-plex panel includes IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, CXCL-10, KC/GRO, MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-2, MIG, LIF, Rantes, LIX, IFN, TNF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, G-CSF and VEGF. 25 μg total proteins extracted from tumor tissue and adjacent normal cerebellum were used for Luminex analysis. The concentration of each cytokine/chemokine/growth factor was normalized to total protein amount.
We performed real-time PCR as described previously ( Liu et al., 2011 65. Liu, C. ∙ Sage, J.C. ∙ Miller, M.R. ... Mosaic analysis with double markers reveals tumor cell of origin in glioma Cell. 2011; 146 :209-221 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Total RNA was isolated from cells/tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation according to the method previously described ( Miller et al., 2009 73. Miller, M.R. ∙ Robinson, K.J. ∙ Cleary, M.D. ... TU-tagging: cell type-specific RNA isolation from intact complex tissues Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :439-441 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ). To extract total RNA from small quantity of cells/tissues or to obtain high quality RNA, RNAqueous-Micro kit (Ambion) or RNeasy micro kit (QIAGEN) was used. cDNA was generated by using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed based on SYBR green method using SyBR green/Rox PCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems). In some cases, qPCR was performed with Taqman method using gene-specific probes (ABI Applied Biosystems). All qPCR reactions were carried out according to manufacturer’s suggestions on ABI StepOnePlus real-time PCR system. Relative levels of cDNA for the interest genes were normalized with the level of those of Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or M-CSF receptor (CSF1R) (when myeloid cells are concerned) in the same cDNA templates. The detailed primer sequences (for SyBR qPCR) and Taqman probes can be found in the Key Resources Table .
In brief ( Liu et al., 2011 65. Liu, C. ∙ Sage, J.C. ∙ Miller, M.R. ... Mosaic analysis with double markers reveals tumor cell of origin in glioma Cell. 2011; 146 :209-221 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ), mice were anaesthetized (60mg/kg ketamine; 12 mg/kg xylazine) and perfused through the right cardiac ventricle with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were then post-fixed overnight at 4°C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (two days at 4°C) and embedded into optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) prior to cryo-sectioning on a cryostat. 12-20 μm sections were captured onto plus slides and dried at room temperature for 1 hour. Tissue slices were then rehydrated with PBS, blocked in 10% serum in PBST (PBS + 0.3%–0.5% Triton X) for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies (diluted in 1% serum PBST) overnight at 4°C. After several washes, Alexa dye conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were applied at 1:500 for 2 hours at room temperature. Following several washes with PBS and counterstaining with DAPI, tissue slices were mounted in 70% glycerol with coverslips. Primary antibodies used were listed below: GFP (Chicken, Aves Labs), IBA1 (Rabbit, DAKO or Goat, Abcam), P2ry12 (Rabbit, Abcam), TMEM119 (Rabbit, Abcam), GFAP (Rabbit, DAKO), PDGFRa (Goat, R&D), NeuN (Rabbit, Abcam), ER-TR7 (Rat, Abcam). To perform CD3e (Armenian Hamster, eBioscience) staining, spleen and tumor tissues were dissected out without perfusion and fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for one hour. We used BrdU incorporation method to identify proliferating cells ( Wojtowicz and Kee, 2006 119. Wojtowicz, J.M. ∙ Kee, N. BrdU assay for neurogenesis in rodents Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :1399-1405 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were first intraperitoneally injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg) prior to perfusion. To visualize incorporated BrdU in cells/tissues, slices were pre-treated with 2M HCL to denature the DNAs and expose BrdU incorporated regions for BrdU antibody (Rat, Bio-rad) to bind.
Images were acquired on confocal system (Zeiss LSM700 or Zeiss LSM880) and processed using ImageJ or Adobe Photoshop CS 6.0 (San Jose, CA). Morphology of Microglia and TAMs was traced by Neurolucida software (Nikon).
Tissue sections from ≥ 3 mice at 3 distinct stages (early, mid, late) of tumor development were immunostained for GFP/RFP fluorescent proteins, CD31 to visualize blood vessels, IBA-1 to visualize microglia/macrophages, BLBP to visualize astrocyte cell bodies, and DAPI for all nuclei. Since medulloblastoma originates from granular neuron precursors (GNPs) in the external germinal layer (EGL), we chose EGL rather than adult cerebellum as the control for comparison to tumor regions. We dissected cerebellum from postnatal day 6 (P6) pups, performed the immunofluorescence staining with the corresponding marker proteins as in tumors. Three images were taken per tumor/EGL at 200X magnification throughout the tumor/ P6 cerebellum. Due to ambiguity in determining individual tumor GNPs, given the dense cellularity of these tumors, DAPI was used as a proxy for total tumor cell number and in the EGL. Some TME cells will also be included in this number, but their presence is so low, compared to GFP+ tumor cells, that inclusion of these cells in total tumor cell number will not significantly affect interpretation. Blood vessel density was determined by quantifying the % area occupied by CD31+ signal. Microglia/macrophage numbers were determined by counting the number of IBA-1+ cells per field of view. Astrocyte numbers were determined by counting the number of BLBP+ cells per field of view. The percentage of TME cell population numbers was calculated by dividing the # of marker-positive cells by the # of total DAPI+ cells in the same field of view and multiplied by 100 to output a percentage value. ImageJ was used for image processing and counting. Excel and Graph Pad Prism were used to perform statistical analysis and a one-way ANOVA was applied to determine significance and error bars represent standard deviation.
Please refer all probes (IGF1 and IL4) for in situ hybridization to Allen Brain atlas. In brief ( Zhao et al., 2009 128. Zhao, C.T. ∙ Li, K. ∙ Li, J.T. ... PKCdelta regulates cortical radial migration by stabilizing the Cdk5 activator p35 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :21353-21358 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), DNA fragment amplified by PCR were ligated into pGEMT-easy vector. The plasmids containing the relevant DNA fragment were purified and then linearized by restriction enzyme. The linearized plasmids were used as template to generate labeled RNA probes with Digoxin by transcription in vitro (Roche). RNA probes (1 μg/ml) were hybridized with cryosectioned slices (12 μm) at 64°C overnight. BCIP/NBT substrates were used to visualize the hybridized cells/tissues. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out after hybridization if we need to pinpoint the particular cell types with positive RNA hybridization signals. In that case, the hybridized slides were further fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for fifteen minutes at room temperature, blocked with 5% donkey serum for one hour at room temperature, followed by primary (IBA, Ki67 and GFAP) and secondary antibody incubation at 4°C overnight. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). At least three tumors were analyzed. Images were acquired from Olympus fluorescence microscope and processed by imageJ.
Tissue microarray (TMA) paraffin sections were mounted on silanized slides, baked for 5 minutes at 90°C, and then de-paraffinized in xylene. Slides were briefly dehydrated in 100% ethanol followed by 35 minutes in hot 1 mM EDTA. Sections were rinsed in dH 2 O and incubated with GFAP (Abcam) diluted in CAS Block (Invitrogen Corporation). Slides were washed in 1X PBS and then incubated with FITC conjugated fluorescent secondary antibody (Abcam) diluted in CAS Block. There is an additional wash in 1XPBS followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (USB Corporation) for 20 minutes. Slides were dehydrated in an ethanol series and air-dried. 20 μl of PTCH1/CEP9 (with GFAP) probe working solution (Empire genomics) was applied to the hybridization area, a 24x50 mm coverslip is placed over the top, and the edges of the coverslip were sealed with a continuous bead of rubber cement. The slide and probe were co-denatured at 95°C for 4 minutes and hybridized 24 hours or more at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Slides were then washed in 2X saline sodium citrate buffer (SSC)/0.1%NP40 at 70°C for 1 minute and DAPI counterstain (Vector Laboratories) was applied as well as a glass coverslip. Visualization of the dual FISH/immunoflourescence signals was accomplished by use of a fluorescent microscope with standard filters.
We chose GFP-guided single cell Laser Capture Microdissection over tissue dissociation considering that non-physiological noises at transcription level could occur during tissue dissociation. For example, an immune signature would be hard to interpret because it is known that glia cells tend to get into an “activated” state after going through a dissociation process ( Bennett et al., 2016 9. Bennett, M.L. ∙ Bennett, F.C. ∙ Liddelow, S.A. ... New tools for studying microglia in the mouse and human CNS Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E1738-E1746 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The laser capture microdissection (LCM) experiment was designed and modified according to previous studies ( Janes et al., 2010; Wang and Janes, 2013 54. Janes, K.A. ∙ Wang, C.C. ∙ Holmberg, K.J. ... Identifying single-cell molecular programs by stochastic profiling Nat. Methods. 2010; 7 :311-317 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar 116. Wang, L. ∙ Janes, K.A. Stochastic profiling of transcriptional regulatory heterogeneities in tissues, tumors and cultured cells Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :282-301 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, tumor brains were removed and slowly lowered into liquid nitrogen-cooled methyl-butane. The brains were kept fully submerged for 1 minute then store at −80°C. Tumor brain was cut at 8 μm thickness on a cryostat and sections were collected on positively-charged slides. Slides were fixed in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes at room temperature and then transferred into 100% xylene for 5 minutes at room temperature. Slide was then air-dried for 5 minutes. Laser capture microdissection of individual cells was performed on an ArcturusXT LCM system (Applied Biosystems) with an infrared laser using CapSure HS LCM caps after optimization of laser power and duration.
Since paraformaldehyde fixation would negatively affect the RNA quality and the subsequent sequencing, all samples were snap frozen without fixation. We found that GFP molecules quickly diffuse away from labeled cells once tissue sections melt or encounter moisture. After extensive troubleshooting we found that pre-chilling slides in the cryostat could prevent melting once tissue sections touch the slide. This trick gave us a couple of precious seconds to dip the slide with still-frozen sections into ethanol to not only fix the RNA but also remove water from sections to prevent GFP loss.
We sectioned the tissue at 8 μm to minimize contamination from the z axis. Initially we tried to use UV laser and found that single cell cutting with UV laser completely destroyed RNAs in the cell, most likely due to the high energy level of UV laser. When we switched to lower-energy IR laser that melts a small point of wax onto each target cell to pull it off, we found that the strength of attachment of sections to slides needs to be optimized every time for precise cell collection. If they attached too loosely, the IR laser would pull off too many surrounding tissue with the target cells. On the other hand, if tissue sections attached too tightly, the IR laser would fail to pick up individual target cells into the collection cap. We controled the attachment strength by warming up pre-chilled slides for ∼1 s (touch finger tip under the slide) then immediately proceeded to LCM. If we encountered problems, the time could be lengthened slightly to increase attachment strength, or shortened slightly to reduce it.
RNA extraction and cDNA amplification procedures were performed as described under optimized conditions for 50 microdissected cells. For each sample, 250 cells were microdissected per LCM cap and split into five 50-cell technical replicates (as a control, one replicate did not undergo reverse transcription) after elution from the cap. Reamplified cDNA (∼500 bp 3′ ends) was purified away from primer concatemers by two rounds of purification with 0.7 × volume of AMPure XP beads (Beckman) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and purified cDNA was quantified by Qubit assay (Life Technologies). For each sample, 1 ng was tagmented with the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) and sequenced as 75 bp paired-end reads on a NextSeq instrument using v2 reagents (Illumina). 14–22 million reads per sample were filtered for signal to noise (chastity filtered), assessed for overall quality with FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ), and then mapped with STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 24. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (6847) PubMed Google Scholar ) against the mouse genome build mm10. Data were quantified as reads per million (RPM), and log(RPM+1) values were clustered hierarchically in MATLAB after row standardization with a Euclidean distance metric and Ward’s linkage.
Primary tumor GNPs were purified with percoll gradient method ( Lee et al., 2009 62. Lee, H.Y. ∙ Greene, L.A. ∙ Mason, C.A. ... Isolation and culture of post-natal mouse cerebellar granule neuron progenitor cells and neurons J. Vis. Exp. 2009; 990 PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, tumor mice were anaesthetized (60mg/kg ketamine; 12 mg/kg xylazine) and tumor tissues were dissected out and digested with Papain (Worthington Biochemical) for 45 minutes at room temperature. Digested tumor pieces were then triturated into single cell dissociates and cleared by passing through 70um cell strainer. The cleared dissociates were applied to percoll gradient (35%/65%) followed by centrifugation at 1300 g for 30 minutes. The cells located at the interface of these two gradient layers are mainly tumor GNPs. These cells were carefully collected and transferred into a new polystyrene tube, washed and spun down at 1000 g for 5 minutes. To evaluate the effects of growth factors (such as IGF1 and HGF), 1x10 5 cells were seeded onto PDL pre-coated coverslips in Neurobasal media supplemented with B27 minus insulin. 4 hours post seeding, IGF1 or HGF was added at varying concentrations. After 2 days in culture, EdU was added at 0.1mM for 3 hours prior to cell harvesting. The proliferation of tumor GNPs was evaluated by EdU incorporation. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Images were acquired on Olympus fluorescence microscope and processed by ImageJ program.
This purification method was adapted from adult microglia purification method ( Nikodemova and Watters, 2012 77. Nikodemova, M. ∙ Watters, J.J. Efficient isolation of live microglia with preserved phenotypes from adult mouse brain J. Neuroinflammation. 2012; 9 :147 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). All steps were performed on ice whenever possible. To get rid of circulating immune cells from brain/tumor tissues, mice underwent trans-cardiac perfusion with sterile ice-cold PBS before tumors were dissected out. Dissected out tumor pieces were digested with Papain (Worthington Biochemical) at 37°C for 45 minutes and dissociated by trituration. Tissue debris was removed by passing tumor dissociates through a 70um cell strainer. Cleared tumor dissociates were then applied to Percoll gradient (18.6%/62.5%) centrifugation at 1300 g for 30 minutes to get rid of myelin and cell debris. The cells that were collected from interface between 18.6% and 62.5% Percoll layers were then captured by anti-CD11b magnetic beads (Meltinyi Biotec, Germany) to enrich tumor associated CD11b+ myeloid populations (TAMs). Finally TAMs were separated out in a magnetic field using MS columns (Meltinyi Biotec, Germany) or through autoMACS Pro Separator.
TAMs were isolated as described above. To ensure the sterility during culture, after trans-cardiac perfusion, tumor mouse was decapitated and soaked completely in betadine before the tumor pieces were dissected out. Also in the final step of TAMs purification, TAMs were manually separated out through MS columns in a laminar hood. The viability of TAMs were evaluated by Trypan blue staining and cell counting under the microscope based on dye exclusion. We consistently reached more than 90% viability. The purity was assessed by counting the contaminated Math1-GFP+ tumor cells and by Iba1 staining. Usually we have less than 10% tumor cell contaminated and Iba1+ cells are approximately 90%. To set up co-culture with tumor cells, acutely prepared TAMs were seeded up to 10K onto coverslips and cultured in Neurobasal media supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies) and 10ng/ml M-CSF (Peprotech) overnight to recover. Next day, TAMs were washed twice with D-PBS. GFP+ tumor GNPs were seeded on top of TAMs at 100K in Neurobasal media supplemented with B27 minus insulin and 5ng/ml M-CSF. After 2 days in culture, EdU was added at 0.1mM for 3 hours prior to cell harvesting. The proliferation of GFP+ tumor GNPs was evaluated by EdU incorporation.
Immune cells were isolated from tumors as described above. After percoll gradient centrifugation, myelin-free cell suspension was incubated with anti-CD45 magnetic beads (Meltinyi Biotec, Germany) at 4°C for 15 minutes to capture all immune cells in the tumors. All the tumor associated immune cells (CD45+) were then separated out through autoMACS Pro Separator. To pin down the identities of these immune cells, surface marker staining followed by flow cytometry was performed with these immune cells. All the staining procedures were carried out at 4°C and in PBS with 0.5% BSA+ 2mM EDTA to maximize the cell viability. To reduce the non-specific immunofluorescence staining, the cells were pre-incubated with anti-mouse CD16/32, a Fc receptor blocker (eBioscience) for 10 minutes. Then the cells were incubated in in an antibody cocktail consisting BV421 anti-CD11b, APC anti-CD45 (BD Bioscience), PE-Cy7 anti-CD19, PE anti-CD3e (eBioscience), biotinylated anti-NK1.1, Zombie Aqua Live/dead dye (BioLegend) for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed with PBS/0.5%BSA/2mM EDTA, and centrifuged at 350 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Pellets were re-suspended and incubated with BV605 conjugated streptavidin for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 350 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Cell pellets were re-suspended in PBS and proceed for flow analysis. In a separate analysis of myeloid cell surface markers, the cells were pre-incubated with anti-mouse CD16/32, a Fc receptor blocker (eBioscience) for 10 minutes. Then anti-P2ry12 (AnaSpec, rabbit polyclonal) was added at 1:400 and incubated for 30 minutes. Cells were washed with PBS/0.5%BSA/2mM EDTA, and centrifuged at 350 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Pellets were re-suspended in an antibody cocktail consisting BV421 anti-CD11b (BD Bioscience), 647 anti-CD192 (CCR2), BV605 anti-CD11c, PE-Cy7 anti-CD45, Zombie Aqua Live/dead dye (BioLegend), PE goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific) and incubated for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 350 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Cell pellets were re-suspended in PBS and proceed for flow analysis with BD LSRFortessa cytometer. Data were analyzed with FlowJo v10 software.
Total RNAs of TAMs and normal microglia from age matched mice were extracted using the RNeasy micro kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA Quality was assessed by Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and samples with RNA integrity > 8 were used for library construction. First and second-strand cDNA synthesis, RNaseq library construction and sequencing were carried out by BGI Americas. High-quality libraries were sequenced by the Illumina® Hiseq2500 sequencer to obtain 75bp paired-end reads. Reads alignment to mm10 mouse reference genome, data processing and TPM (Total read per million) calculation were done by using package in the R statistical computing environment ( Anders and Huber, 2010; Patro et al., 2014; Soneson et al., 2015 3. Anders, S. ∙ Huber, W. Differential expression analysis for sequence count data Genome Biol. 2010; 11 :R106 Crossref Scopus (7074) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Patro, R. ∙ Mount, S.M. ∙ Kingsford, C. Sailfish enables alignment-free isoform quantification from RNA-seq reads using lightweight algorithms Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :462-464 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar 104. Soneson, C. ∙ Love, M.I. ∙ Robinson, M.D. Differential analyses for RNA-seq: transcript-level estimates improve gene-level inferences F1000Res. 2015; 4 :1521 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). After estimating transcript abundances with Sailfish ( Patro et al., 2014 83. Patro, R. ∙ Mount, S.M. ∙ Kingsford, C. Sailfish enables alignment-free isoform quantification from RNA-seq reads using lightweight algorithms Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :462-464 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ), we converted the abundance estimates to counts of reads mapping to GENCODE genes using the tximport package in the R statistical computing environment ( Soneson et al., 2015 104. Soneson, C. ∙ Love, M.I. ∙ Robinson, M.D. Differential analyses for RNA-seq: transcript-level estimates improve gene-level inferences F1000Res. 2015; 4 :1521 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We then used the DESeq2 Bioconductor package ( Love et al., 2014 66. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (10228) PubMed Google Scholar ) to normalize count data, estimate dispersion, and fit a negative binomial model for each gene. GENCODE/Ensembl gene IDs mapping to predicted genes were excluded and the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate procedure was used to re-estimate the adjusted p values for GENCODE/Ensembl gene IDs mapping to known genes. Genes were filtered for low abundance by selecting on genes with a TPM > 20 in at least one group. Pathway analyses were performed using a compilation of previously defined pathways from consortiums such as GO via the Broad Institute’s MSigDB resource (Subramanian source). Fisher’s exact tests were performed to determine significant pathway enrichment. All codes used for analyses are available upon request.
Statistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 6 using unpaired Student’s two-tailed t test, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA, according to test requirements. No inclusion/exclusion criteria were pre-established. Grubbs’ Outlier Test was used to determine outliers, which were excluded from final analysis. A P value of < 0.05 (indicated by one asterisk), < 0.01 (indicated by two asterisks), < 0.001 (indicated by three asterisks), < 0.0001 (indicated by four asterisks) or were considered significant.
RNA-sequencing data of TuAstrocyte were deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE111734 . RNA-sequencing data of TAMs were deposited in GEO: GSE109750 . This study did not generate any unique code.
