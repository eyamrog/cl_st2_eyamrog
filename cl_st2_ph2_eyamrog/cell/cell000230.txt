Title: Structural and Functional Analysis of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variant


Abstract: Summary

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein variant D614G supplanted the ancestral virus worldwide, reaching near fixation in a matter of months. Here we show that D614G was more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, and on cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 or of ACE2 orthologs from various mammals, including Chinese rufous horseshoe bat and Malayan pangolin. D614G did not alter S protein synthesis, processing, or incorporation into SARS-CoV-2 particles, but D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts an interprotomer contact and that the conformation is shifted toward an ACE2 binding-competent state, which is modeled to be on pathway for virion membrane fusion with target cells. Consistent with this more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated.

Section: Introduction

Next-generation sequencing permits real-time detection of genetic variants that appear in pathogens during disease outbreaks. Tracking viral variants now constitutes a requisite component of the epidemiologist’s toolkit, one that can pinpoint the origin of a zoonotic virus and the trajectory it takes from one susceptible host to another ( Hadfield et al., 2018 14. Hadfield, J. ∙ Megill, C. ∙ Bell, S.M. ...

GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data - from vision to reality Euro Surveill. 2017; 22 ii–30494 Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar ). Lagging behind sequence-based modeling of virus phylogenies and transmission chains is the ability to understand the effect of viral variants on the efficiency of transmission between hosts or on the clinical severity of infection. Most sequence variants that arise during virus replication are either detrimental to the fitness of the virus or without consequence. Even so, such variants can increase in frequency over the course of an outbreak by chance ( Grubaugh et al., 2020 12. Grubaugh, N.D. ∙ Petrone, M.E. ∙ Holmes, E.C. We shouldn’t worry when a virus mutates during disease outbreaks Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :529-530 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). More rarely, though, increasing frequency of a variant can reflect competitive advantage due to higher intrinsic replication capacity, with increased viral load and transmissibility.
In December 2019, an outbreak of unexplained fatal pneumonia became apparent in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. By early January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the virus causing the disease ( Huang et al., 2020 19. Huang, C. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, X. ...

The virus closest in sequence to SARS-CoV-2 observed to date was isolated from a bat ( Zhou et al., 2020b 58. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.-L. ∙ Wang, X.-G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14578) PubMed Google Scholar ), although the most proximal animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown ( Andersen et al., 2020 1.

Sarbecoviruses, the viral subgenus containing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, undergo frequent recombination, but SARS-CoV-2 is not a recombinant of any Sarbecoviruses detected to date. Its receptor-binding motif, important for human ACE2 receptor-binding specificity, appears to be an ancestral trait shared with multiple bat viruses ( Boni et al., 2020 3.

Microbiol. 2020; 2020 :28 Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar ).
Among RNA viruses, coronaviruses are remarkable for having the largest known genomes ( Saberi et al., 2018 36. Saberi, A. ∙ Gulyaeva, A.A. ∙ Brubacher, J.L. ... A planarian nidovirus expands the limits of RNA genome size PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007314 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) and for encoding a 3′-to-5′-exoribonuclease that permits high-fidelity replication by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( Denison et al., 2011 8.

Virol. 2014; 1 :111-132 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). By preventing otherwise lethal mutagenesis ( Smith et al., 2013 40. Smith, E.C. ∙ Blanc, H. ∙ Surdel, M.C. ... Coronaviruses lacking exoribonuclease activity are susceptible to lethal mutagenesis: evidence for proofreading and potential therapeutics PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 :e1003565 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), the coronavirus exonuclease is thought necessary for the coronavirus genome size to extend beyond the theoretical limit imposed by error rates of viral RNA polymerases ( Holmes, 2003 17. Holmes, E.C. Error thresholds and the constraints to RNA virus evolution Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11 :543-546 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the rate of sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates is modest, over the course of the pandemic the virus has had opportunity to generate numerous sequence variants, many of which have been identified among the thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced to date ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ) ( Hadfield et al., 2018 14. Hadfield, J. ∙ Megill, C. ∙ Bell, S.M. ... Nextstrain: real-time tracking of pathogen evolution Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4121-4123 Crossref Scopus (1781) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we investigate potential functional and structural consequences of one of these variants, the Spike protein variant D614G, which has been associated with increased viral load in people with COVID-19 ( Korber et al., 2020 23.

Section: Results

Over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 12,379 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in genomic data (GISAID download on June 25, 2020). 6,077 of the SNPs were seen only once in the dataset, and only four SNPs rose to high frequency. These four SNPs include C241U in the 5′UTR, a silent mutation C3037U, C14408U encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase variant P323L, and A23403G encoding the spike protein variant D614G. A23403G was first reported at the end of January 2020 in virus genomes from China and Germany. Given how few SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced from early in the outbreak, the geographic origin of A23403G cannot be determined. The frequency of A23403G has increased steadily over time and is now present in approximately 74% of all published sequences ( Figure 1 A). Sequences available over recent weeks, though, indicate that A23403G has nearly reached fixation globally ( Figures 1 A and 1B).
The ability of the D614G S protein variant to target virions for infection of ACE2-positive cells was assessed by using single-cycle lentiviral vector pseudotypes in tissue culture. Mammalian expression plasmids were engineered to encode the ancestral S protein D614 or the D614G variant. Each S protein expression plasmid was separately transfected into HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding HIV-1 structural proteins and enzymes. Separate plasmids were transfected that encode RNAs with HIV-1 cis -acting signals for packaging and replication and either GFP or luciferase (Luc) reporter cassettes. For each condition tested, multiple virus stocks were produced, and each stock was tested in triplicate after vector particle normalization by using reverse-transcriptase activity. Forty-eight hours after challenge with the vectors, the transduction efficiency of each virion preparation was assessed by measuring the percent of GFP-positive cells using flow cytometry or by quantitating target cell-associated luciferase activity.
When Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells were used as targets, challenge with virus bearing D614G resulted in 6-fold more GFP-positive cells, or 5-fold more bulk luciferase activity, than did particles bearing D614 S protein ( Figure 2 A). When Caco-2 human colon epithelial cells were used as target cells, 4-fold higher infectivity was observed with D614G ( Figure 2 A). Additionally, when HEK293 cells or SupT1 cells had been rendered infectable by stable expression of exogenous ACE2 and TMPRSS2, D614G was 9-fold more infectious than was D614 ( Figure 2 A).
The likely zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 raises the question of whether D614G was selected during the pandemic as a result of human-to-human transmission. To determine whether the increased infectivity of D614G is specific for certain ACE2 orthologs, HEK293 cells were transfected separately with plasmids encoding ACE2 orthologs from human ( Homo sapiens ), Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus sinicus ), Malayan pangolin ( Manis javanica ), cat ( Felis catus ), and dog ( Canis lupis ). Each ACE2 transfectant was then challenged with luciferase reporter viruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, either D614 or D614G. Relative increase in infectivity due to D614G was comparable in cells expressing all of these ACE2 orthologs ( Figure 2 B), demonstrating that increased infectivity due to D614G is not specific for human ACE2.
The effect of D614G on S protein synthesis, processing, and incorporation into virion particles produced by SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins was assessed next ( Figure 3 A). HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing each of the four SARS-CoV-2 virion-associated structural proteins ( Figure 3 A). Western blots were then performed on the cell lysate and on proteins from the pellet after ultracentrifugation of the transfection cell supernatant. The minimal requirement for virion assembly by other coronaviruses is the membrane protein (M) and the envelope protein (E) (for mouse hepatitis virus [ Bos et al., 1996 4. Bos, E.C. ∙ Luytjes, W. ∙ van der Meulen, H.V. ... The production of recombinant infectious DI-particles of a murine coronavirus in the absence of helper virus Virology. 1996; 218 :52-60 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vennema et al., 1996 44. Vennema, H. ∙ Godeke, G.J. ∙ Rossen, J.W. ... Nucleocapsid-independent assembly of coronavirus-like particles by co-expression of viral envelope protein genes EMBO J. 1996; 15 :2020-2028 Crossref Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ]) or the M and nucleocapsid protein (N) (for SARS-CoV [ Huang et al., 2004 18. Huang, Y. ∙ Yang, Z.-Y. ∙ Kong, W.-P. ... Generation of synthetic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus pseudoparticles: implications for assembly and vaccine production J. Virol. 2004; 78 :12557-12565 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ]). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, M protein production was sufficient to release particles from transfected cells, although particle release by M was increased by co-production of N ( Figure 3 B). The S proteins D614 and D614G were produced to comparable levels, processed to S1 and S2 with comparable efficiency, and incorporated into SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles at similar levels ( Figure 3 B). These results suggest that increased infectivity due to D614G is primarily manifested after virion assembly, during entry into target cells.
Although D614G is located outside of the receptor-binding domain, this non-conservative amino acid change might alter ACE2-binding properties via allosteric effects. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to determine whether the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding to human ACE2 is changed by D614G. Human ACE2 was immobilized, and the binding of soluble, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein, either D614 or D614G, was detected. At 25°C, the rate of association with ACE2 was little different between D614G and D614, but D614G dissociated from ACE2 at a rate 4-fold faster than D614, resulting in a 5.7-fold reduction in binding affinity ( Figure 4 ). At 37°C, the association rate between D614G and ACE2 was slower than that between D614 and ACE2, and the dissociation rate of D614G was faster, again resulting in 5-fold reduction in binding affinity ( Figure 4 ). Consistent with this increased affinity, the 25-nM dilution of D614 S protein was too high to be measured at 37°C ( Figure 4 C). These data demonstrate that the increased infectivity of D614G is not explained by greater ACE2 binding strength.
The global spread and enhanced infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant raises the question of whether this structural change would compromise the effectiveness of antiviral therapies targeting the S protein, especially if they were designed to target D614. To determine if this is the case, the neutralization potency of four monoclonal antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain was assessed. These fully human monoclonal antibodies ( Hansen et al., 2020 15. Hansen, J. ∙ Baum, A. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Studies in humanized mice and convalescent humans yield a SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail Science. 2020; 369 :1010-1014 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ) are currently under evaluation in clinical trials as therapeutics for COVID-19 (NCT04425629, NCT04426695). Each of these monoclonal antibodies, whether tested individually or in various combinations, demonstrated similar neutralization potency against D614G as they did against D614 ( Figure 5 ).
Because the increased infectivity of D614G was not explained by increased affinity for ACE2 ( Figure 4 ), cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) was used to illuminate potential structural features that distinguish D614G from D614 ( Table 1 ). Structural studies of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S protein ectodomain demonstrate that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of each protomer can independently adopt either a closed or an open conformation, giving rise to asymmetric trimers ( Walls et al., 2020 48. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

The open conformation is required for ACE2 binding because the ACE2 binding site is partially shielded in the closed conformation ( Shang et al., 2020 38. Shang, J. ∙ Ye, G. ∙ Shi, K. ... Structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2020; 581 :221-224 Crossref Scopus (2572) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; 367 :1444-1448 Crossref Scopus (3567) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the open conformation is believed to be on pathway for S protein-mediated fusion of the virion membrane with the target cell membrane ( Tortorici and Veesler, 2019 42. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Veesler, D. Structural insights into coronavirus entry Adv. Virus Res. 2019; 105 :93-116 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both S protein variants, D614 and D614G, were expressed in mammalian cells as soluble trimers. When enriched from culture media, and eluted from a size-exclusion column, single peaks were observed for each variant protein at ∼500 kD, the predicted mass of the homotrimer ( Figure S1 A). Enrichment of the protein complexes, and integrity of the full-length protomers, was additionally confirmed by SDS-PAGE ( Figure S1 B).
Well-defined particles of S protein trimers were evident by cryo-EM ( Figure S1 C), and reference-free, two-dimensional clustering revealed structural details from different orientations ( Figure S1 D). Three-dimensional clustering and refinement generated the final density map for D614G ( Figure 6 A, EMDB: EMD-22301), which showed a similar overall architecture to the published map of D614 ( Figure 6 B). Unmasked Fourier shell correlation (FSC) analysis indicated that the D614G map had a mean resolution of 3.7 Å (gold-standard criteria, Figure S1 E; half-map FSC, Figure S1 F) which is sufficient to reveal fine differences from D614.
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein consists of S1 and S2 subunits, with multiple domains within S1 ( Figure 6 C). Comparing the map of D614G with that of D614, the N-terminal domain (NTD), the intermediary domain (INT), and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 subunit were clearly identified ( Figure 6 A and 6B). However, the density corresponding to the RBD, which was well resolved in D614 (arrows, Figure 6 B), was scattered in the D614G map ( Figure 6 A), suggesting that its RBD is flexible and adopts multiple conformations (see section below).
Based on the resolved ensemble cryo-EM density map ( Figure 6 A) and the primary sequence ( Figure 6 C), an atomic model of D614G without the RBD was built ( Figure 6 D; PDB: 6XS6 ) and validated ( Figure S1 G, model-to-map FSC; Figure S1 H, local resolution). In the structural model, the S2 subunit of D614G overlapped well with the published structures for D614 (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] = 0.77 Å). In contrast, there was significant deviation within the S1 subunit (RMSD = 4.5 Å; Figures 6 E and 6F). When the S1 subunit of D614G was superimposed on the closed conformation of D614, the S1-NTD and S1-INT shifted away from each other by 6 Å and 4 Å, respectively ( Figures 6 E, S2 B, and S2C), revealing a wider space between these two domains. When the S1 subunit of D614G was superimposed on D614 in the open conformation, the S1-NTD was shifted outward by 3 Å, whereas the S1-INT overlapped well with that of D614 ( Figure 6 F).
D614 localizes to the interface between two protomers where its side chain forms hydrogen bonds with the T859 side chain in the adjacent protomer ( Figure 6 G). The effect of D614G on this interaction could be assessed since local resolution in the map generated here reached 3.2 Å. The atomic model showed that D614G has two consequences. First, D614G disrupts the inter-protomer hydrogen bond with Thr859 ( Figures 6 H and 6I), weakening the stability of the trimer. In effect, D614 acts as a “latch” that secures two protomers together, and D614G loosens this latch ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Second, intra-protomer distance between the backbone amine of residue 614 and the backbone carboxyl group of residue 647 is shortened from 3.4 Å to 2.7 Å, presumably stabilizing the CTD.
To better assess the conformation of the RBD, the flexible region of S1 was subjected to masked three-dimensional classification and refinement, with the aim of resolving the conformational heterogeneity in that region. Two distinct classes arose from this analysis of the dataset. 58% of the protomers adopted an open conformation in which the RBD is positioned to interact with ACE2, and 42% were in the closed conformation in which the RBD is buried ( Figures 7 A and 7B). This ratio of the two conformations contrasted dramatically with assessment of D614 structural data ( Walls et al., 2020 48. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5950) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which only 18% of the RBDs were in the open conformation and 82% in the closed conformation. The closed conformation of D614G overlapped well with the closed conformation of D614, whereas the open conformation of D614G showed significant deviation of all S1 domains away from the S2 subunit when compared with the open conformation of D614 ( Figure 7 C).
Further classification of D614G homotrimers to determine the distribution of RBD conformations revealed four categories ( Figure 7 D). 5% of the particles had all three protomers in the closed conformation. 36% had one open protomer. 39% had two open protomers. 20% of the particles had all three protomers in the open conformation ( Figure 7 D). Analysis of D614 ( Walls et al., 2020 48. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5950) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that 46% of particles were in the all-closed conformation, and 54% in the one open conformation. These data further emphasize the contrast between D614G conformational space and that of D614.

Section: Discussion

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein variant D614G is one of only four SNPs, out of the more than 12,000 reported in GISAID, that has risen to high frequency ( Figure 1 ). This suggests that D614G confers a replication advantage to SARS-CoV-2, such that it increases the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Data in which the presence of D614G correlates with increased rates of transmission through human populations would support this hypothesis. Several groups suggest that such an association exists ( Furuyama et al., 2020 11. Furuyama, T.N. ∙ Antoneli, F. ∙ Isabel, M.V. ...

Evaluating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation D614G on transmissibility and pathogenicity medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), although adequately powered datasets, appropriately controlled for age and other variables, have eluded investigators. Future prospective comparisons of D614G transmission to that of D614 seem unlikely given that D614G has gone to near fixation worldwide ( Figure 1 ). However, the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that have been sequenced are only a narrow snapshot of the pandemic and additional sequencing of archived samples might pinpoint the origin of D614G or better resolve the variant’s trajectory.
Indirect evidence that D614G is more infectious was provided here by experiments with pseudotyped viruses showing that D614G transduces 3- to 9-fold more efficiently than does the ancestral S protein ( Figure 2 A). This effect was seen with a range of cellular targets, including lung and colon epithelial cells. Efforts are underway to compare the replication efficiency of D614G with that of D614 in the context of the nearly 30,000-nucleotide SARS-CoV-2 genome. Such reverse genetic experiments, though, are technically difficult and potentially confounded by acquisition of unnatural, tissue-culture-adapted mutations during genome rescue and expansion in transformed cell lines, as has occurred during similar assessments of Ebola virus variants ( Marzi et al., 2018 28.

Consistent with the increased ability of D614G to infect cells in tissue culture, several studies suggest that D614G is associated with increased viral load in people with COVID-19 ( Korber et al., 2020 23.

If SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614G is an adaptive variant that was selected for increased human-to-human transmission after spillover from an animal reservoir, one might expect that increased infectivity would only be evident on cells bearing ACE2 orthologs similar to that in humans. In contrast to the primate-specific increase in infectivity that was reported for the major clade-forming Ebola virus glycoprotein variant from the 2013–2016 West African outbreak ( Diehl et al., 2016 9. Diehl, W.E. ∙ Lin, A.E. ∙ Grubaugh, N.D. ... Ebola Virus Glycoprotein with Increased Infectivity Dominated the 2013-2016 Epidemic Cell. 2016; 167 :1088-1098.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ; Urbanowicz et al., 2016 43. Urbanowicz, R.A. ∙ McClure, C.P. ∙ Sakuntabhai, A. ... Human Adaptation of Ebola Virus during the West African Outbreak Cell. 2016; 167 :1079-1087.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ), the increased infectivity of D614G was equally evident on cells bearing ACE2 orthologs from a range of mammalian species ( Figure 2 B). The fact that D614G was more infectious on cells expressing ACE2 orthologs from Chinese rufous horseshoe bat and Malayan pangolin raises the question of why D614G does not dominate the sequences of closely related Sarbecoviruses that circulate in these species. Among these viruses, only SARS-CoV-2 possesses a polybasic furin cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction in the S protein, which is required for SARS-CoV-2 to infect human lung cells but not other cell types ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 16. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Pöhlmann, S. A Multibasic Cleavage Site in the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Is Essential for Infection of Human Lung Cells Mol. Cell. 2020; 78 :779-784.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, when non-lung cells are challenged, disruption of the furin-cleavage site increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity to the same extent as does D614G ( Zhang et al., 2020 56. Zhang, L. ∙ Jackson, C.B. ∙ Mou, H. ... The D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reduces S1 shedding and increases infectivity bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.06.12.148726 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). These observations suggest not only that D614G increases infectivity in the presence of the furin cleavage site but also that D614G offers no selective advantage when transmission is possible in the absence of the furin site, as appears to be the case in bats and pangolins. Another possible explanation for why D614G dominated the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but has not been detected in bats, is that unlike bats, humans are immunologically naive to Sarbecoviruses. Interestingly, HIV-1 variants with increased infectivity in tissue culture have been isolated from the central nervous system, a compartment with reduced immune pressure ( Peters et al., 2004 33. Peters, P.J. ∙ Bhattacharya, J. ∙ Hibbitts, S. ...

HIV-1 replication in the central nervous system occurs in two distinct cell types PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7 :e1002286 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Insight into the mechanism by which D614G increases infectivity was gleaned from cryo-EM studies of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein trimer. D614G exhibited striking conformational changes ( Figures 6 E, 6F, 7 C, and 7D), all of which could be attributable to disruption of the interprotomer latch between D614 in S1 and T859 in S2 ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Weakening of the interprotomer contacts results in increased distance between the protomers and a dramatic flip in the ratio of open to closed S protein particles, from 82% closed and 18% open for D614 to 42% closed and 58% open for D614G. When S protein trimers were examined more closely, in addition to the all-closed conformation and the one open conformation previously reported for D614 ( Walls et al., 2020 48. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ... Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5950) PubMed Google Scholar ), a significant fraction of D614G trimers populated a two-open conformation (39%) and an all-open state (20%). Previous structural studies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins identified similar conformations, with only MERS-CoV S protein exhibiting an all-open state like that reported here ( Gui et al., 2017 13. Gui, M. ∙ Song, W. ∙ Zhou, H. ...

Commun. 2017; 8 :15092 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). When the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD is in its closed conformation, the binding site for ACE2 is physically blocked ( Shang et al., 2020 38. Shang, J. ∙ Ye, G. ∙ Shi, K. ... Structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2020; 581 :221-224 Crossref Scopus (2572) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; 367 :1444-1448 Crossref Scopus (3567) PubMed Google Scholar ). Models of coronavirus S-mediated membrane fusion describe ACE2 binding to all three RBD domains in the open conformation as destabilizing the pre-fusion S trimer, leading to dissociation of S1 from S2 and promoting transition to the post-fusion conformation ( Pallesen et al., 2017 32. Pallesen, J. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike antigen Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E7348-E7357 Crossref Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ; Walls et al., 2019 47. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ... Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ). According to these models, the well-populated all-open conformation of D614G ( Figure 7 D) would reflect an intermediate that is on-pathway to S-mediated membrane fusion.
Despite the increased infectivity of D614G in tissue culture, and the increased viral load in infected people, increased COVID-19 disease severity has not been detected in association with D614G infection ( Korber et al., 2020 23. Korber, B. ∙ Fischer, W.M. ∙ Gnanakaran, S. ..., Sheffield COVID-19 Genomics Group Tracking Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: Evidence that D614G Increases Infectivity of the COVID-19 Virus Cell. 2020; 182 :812-827.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2714) PubMed Google Scholar ; McNamara et al., 2020 29.

Github 2020 https://github.com/blab/ncov-wa-d614g Google Scholar ). Perhaps there are fitness tradeoffs for D614G in vivo due to the more open conformation of its RBD ( Figure 7 ), which potentially renders D614G more immunogenic. In keeping with the fact that the location of D614G within the S protein is remote from the receptor-binding domain, that D614G affinity for ACE2 is less than that of D614 ( Figure 4 ), and that the relatively better-concealed D614 receptor-binding domain is likely to be advantageous for immune evasion, the D614G and D614 variants are equally sensitive to neutralization by human monoclonal antibodies targeting the S protein RBD ( Figure 5 ).

Section: Limitations of Study

Although the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants presented here is based on viral RNA obtained from tens of thousands of people infected with the virus from around the world, the available samples are highly skewed in terms of geographic origin, and they reflect only a fraction of a percent of all circulating SARS-CoV-2. Additional sequencing of archived samples, or of viruses currently circulating, could shed further light on the pandemic trajectory of D614G. The current high frequency of D614G throughout the world suggests that this variant transmits person to person more efficiently than do viruses bearing D614, but demographically matched cohorts that might be used for comparing transmission likelihood of D614 versus D614G have been difficult to assemble. Another complication of any epidemiologic study of human transmission is that D614G is generally accompanied by three other sequence variants. Nonetheless, the pseudotype experiments presented here show a pronounced increase in infectivity with D614G in isolation, and the structural studies are consistent with conformational changes expected for a more infectious S protein variant. Ultimately, the pseudotype results presented here need confirmation in the context of full-length recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and extension to transmission studies using an animal model. Finally, the structural determination of D614G performed here was with a widely used soluble version of the S protein that differs from the native protein in three aspects. First, the original furin cleavage site was removed. Second, a di-proline motif was introduced to stabilize the S protein. Third, the original transmembrane domain was substituted by a synthetic trimerization helix. Examination of the effect of D614G on native S protein will require electron cryotomography to directly visualize the S protein on virion-like particles.

All cells used here were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection or ATCC ( https://www.atcc.org ). Cells were cultured in humidified incubators with 5% CO 2 at 37°C, and monitored for mycoplasma contamination using the Mycoplasma Detection kit (Lonza LT07-318). HEK293 Homo sapiens , female, embryonic kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1573), and the HEK293T cells that were derived from them (CRL-3216 or CRL-11268), were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 mM GlutaMAX, 1 × MEM non-essential amino acids, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. Calu3 Homo sapiens , male, lung adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC HTB-55) were maintained in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Caco2 Homo sapiens , male, colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC HTB-37) were maintained in EMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. SUP-T1 [VB] Homo sapiens , male, T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma cells (ATCC CRL-1942) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 20mM GlutaMAX, 1xMEM non-essential amino acids, and 25 mM HEPES, pH7.2. Vero Cercopithecus aethiops female kidney epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-81) were cultured in DMEM high glucose media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin/L-Glutamine.
24 h prior to transfection, 6 × 10 5 HEK293 cells were plated per well in 6 well plates. All transfections used 2.49 μg plasmid DNA with 6.25 μL TransIT LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) in 250 μL Opti-MEM (GIBCO). Single-cycle HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, either D614 or D614G, were produced by transfection of either HIV-1 pNL4-3 Δenv Δvpr luciferase reporter plasmid (pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-), or pUC57mini NL4-3 Δenv eGFP reporter plasmid, in combination with the indicated Spike expression plasmid, at a ratio of 4:1. ACE2 expression vectors were produced by transfecting cells with one of the pscALPSpuro-ACE2 plasmids, along with the HIV-1 gag-pol expression plasmid psPAX2, and the VSV glycoprotein expression plasmid pMD2.G (4:3:1 ratio of plasmids). 16 h post-transfection, culture media was changed. Viral supernatant was harvested 48 h after media change, passed through a 0.45 μm filter, and stored at 4°C. TMPRSS2 expression transfer vector was produced similarly but with pscALPSblasti-TMPRSS2.

Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (27225) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the “–keeplength” and “–addfragments” parameters, which preserve the coordinate space of the reference sequence. To remove lower-quality sequences from the dataset, all sequences in the alignment were masked with ambiguous bases (‘N’) in the regions spanning the first 100bp and the last 50bp, as well as at error-prone sites located at the (1-indexed, NC_045512.2 coordinate space) positions 13402, 24389, 24390. Sequences shorter than 28kb or with > 2% ambiguous bases were removed from the alignment. The frequency of D614G was calculated in the resulting data by extracting the sequence region corresponding to the gene for the S protein, spanning 21563-25384bp. These sequences were processed using a script importing biopython ( Cock et al., 2009 6. Cock, P.J.A. ∙ Antao, T. ∙ Chang, J.T. ... Biopython: freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology and bioinformatics Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1422-1423 Crossref Scopus (2958) PubMed Google Scholar ) to remove any gaps introduced by the alignment process and translate the sequence to protein space. The identity of the variant at amino acid position 614 was tabulated for the full dataset and reported as frequency by date using the collection dates reported in the Nextstrain-curated metadata file available from GISAID ( Hadfield et al., 2018 14. Hadfield, J. ∙ Megill, C. ∙ Bell, S.M. ... Nextstrain: real-time tracking of pathogen evolution Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4121-4123 Crossref Scopus (1781) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shu and McCauley, 2017 39. Shu, Y. ∙ McCauley, J. GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data - from vision to reality Euro Surveill. 2017; 22 ii–30494 Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar ). The frequency was calculated as (# sequences with D614G)/(# sequences). Frequency within the six continental regions was calculated based on the “region” geographic classification associated with each sample in the metadata. Frequency values were linearly interpolated for dates surrounded by valid data. The frequency of the last date with data was carried forward where recent dates lack data. The resulting values were rendered as plots using matplotlib ( Hunter, 2007 20. Hunter, J.D. Matplotlib: A 2D Graphics Environment Comput. Sci. Eng. 2007; 9 :90-95 Crossref Scopus (20585) Google Scholar ). The script for analyzing and plotting D614G variant frequency is available via GitHub: https://github.com/broadinstitute/sc2-variation-scripts .
The diversity of SNPs and their functional effects based on the same GISAID sequences and MAFFT alignment used to plot the frequency of D614G over time, with the 5′ and 3′ ends not masked. In the alignment, ambiguous nucleotide codes (R,Y,W,S,M,K,H,B,V,D) were all masked with “N” values. SNPs were calculated from the alignment using the snp-sites tool ( Page et al., 2016 31. Page, A.J. ∙ Taylor, B. ∙ Delaney, A.J. ... SNP-sites : rapid efficient extraction of SNPs from multi-FASTA alignments Microb. Genom. 2016; 2 :e000056 Crossref Scopus (699) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting VCF-format file was normalized using bcftools ( Li et al., 2009 26. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (37569) PubMed Google Scholar ) to include only SNPs. The VCF file with SNPs was annotated for functional effects using SnpEff ( Cingolani et al., 2012 5. Cingolani, P. ∙ Platts, A. ∙ Wang, L. ... A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3 Fly (Austin). 2012; 6 :80-92 Crossref Scopus (6968) PubMed Google Scholar ).
5 μL transfection supernatant was mixed with 5 μL 0.25% Triton X-100, 50 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, and 0.4 U/μL RiboLock RNase inhibitor, and then diluted 1:100 in 5 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 20 mM KCl, and 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3. 10 μL of this was then added to a single-step, RT-PCR assay with 35 nM MS2 RNA (IDT) as template, 500 nM of each primer (5′-TCCTGCTCAACTTCCTGTCGAG-3′ and 5′-CACAGGTCAAACCTCCTAGGAATG-3′), and 0.1 μL hot-start Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) in 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 5 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 1/20,000 SYBR Green I (Invitrogen), and 200 μM dNTPs in total 20 μL reaction. The RT-PCR reaction was carried out in a Biorad CFX96 real-time PCR detection system with the following parameters: 42°C for 20 min, 95°C for 2 min, and 40 cycles [95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 5 s, 72°C for 15 s, and acquisition at 80°C for 5 s].
2.5 × 10 5 HEK293 cells were plated per well in a 12 well plate. The next day cells were transduced with 250 uL of supernatant containing TMPRSS2-encoding lentivirus for 16 h at 37°C, after which fresh media was added to cells. 48 h after transduction cells were replated and selected with blasticidin (InvivoGen, catalog #ant-bl-1) at 10 ug/mL. After selection, cells were transduced similarly with supernatant containing ACE2-encoding lentivirus and selected with 1 ug/mL of puromycin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, catalog #ant-pr-1).
1 × 10 6 SupT1 cells were transduced with 400 uL of supernatant containing TMPRSS2-encoding virus followed by selection with 10 ug/mL blasticidin 48 h later. TMPRSS2 expressing SupT1 cells were then transduced with a second vector expressing ACE2, followed by puromycin selection at 1 ug/mL.
16 h prior to transduction, adherent cells were seeded in 96 well plates. HEK293 cells were plated at 5 × 10 4 cells per well. Calu3 and Caco2 were plated at 3 × 10 4 per well. Cells were incubated in virus-containing media for 16 h at 37°C when fresh medium was added to cells. 48 to 72 h after transduction cells were assessed for luciferase activity or for GFP by flow cytometry. For transfection of SupT1 cells, 1 × 10 5 cells were plated in a U-bottom 96 well plate and spinfected at 30°C with 100 uL of virus-containing media for 2 h at 1,200 x g. Fresh media was added after spinfection and cells were incubated 48-72 h prior to analysis. Cells transduced with GFP virus were fixed with BD Cytofix (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, Cat number 554655) and analyzed using the Accuri C6system. Data was analyzed using FlowJo 10.5 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR). Cells transduced with luciferase expressing virus were assessed using Promega Steady-Glo system (Promega Madison, WI).
VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticle generation and neutralization assays were performed as previously described ( Baum et al., 2020 2. Baum, A. ∙ Fulton, B.O. ∙ Wloga, E. ... Antibody cocktail to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prevents rapid mutational escape seen with individual antibodies Science. 2020; 369 :1014-1018 Crossref Scopus (877) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hansen et al., 2020 15. Hansen, J. ∙ Baum, A. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Studies in humanized mice and convalescent humans yield a SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail Science. 2020; 369 :1010-1014 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ). HEK293T cells were seeded overnight in DMEM high glucose media (Life Technologies) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), and Penicillin/- Streptomycin-L-Glutamine (Life Technologies). The following day, Spike expression plasmids were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s protocol. At 24 h post transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and infected at an MOI of 1 with the VSVΔG:mNeon/VSV-G virus diluted in 10 mL Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). The cells were incubated 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were washed three times with PBS to remove residual input virus and overlaid with DMEM high glucose media (Life Technologies) with 0.7% low IgG BSA (Sigma), sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), and gentamicin (Life Technologies). After 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2, the supernatant containing pseudoparticles was collected, centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 5 min to clarify, aliquoted, and frozen at −80°C.
For neutralization assays, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well plates 24 h prior to assay and grown to 85% confluence before challenge. Antibodies were diluted in DMEM high 3 glucose media containing 0.7% Low IgG BSA (Sigma), 1X Sodium Pyruvate, and 0.5% Gentamicin (this will be referred to as “Infection Media”) to 2X assay concentration and diluted 3-fold down in Infection Media, for an 11-point dilution curve in the assay beginning at 10 ug/mL (66.67 nM). pVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles were diluted 1:1 in Infection Media for a fluorescent focus (ffu) count in the assay of ∼1000 ffu. Antibody dilutions were mixed 1:1 with pseudoparticles for 30 min at room temperature prior to addition onto Vero cells. Cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. Supernatant was removed from cells and replaced with 100 uL PBS, and fluorescent foci were quantitated using the SpectraMax i3 plate reader with MiniMax imaging cytometer.
HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum, and transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmids encoding the SARS-CoV-2 M, E, N, and S proteins, in different combinations, as indicated. 1 ug of each plasmid was used, with 5 ug of total plasmid in each transfection, normalized using empty vectors, in 400 ul Opti-MEM and 18 ul of PEI. The transfection mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and dropped into a 50% confluent 10 cm plate of HEK293T cells. The media and cell lysate were collected after 60 h. 10 mL of supernatant was passed through a 0.45 um syringe filter, layered on top of a 20% sucrose cushion in PBS, and spun at 30,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (111,000 x g, average) for two h. The pellet was washed once with ice cold PBS, resuspended in 150 ul of 2x SDS loading buffer (Morris formulation), and sonicated in an ice-water bath (Branson 2800) for 15 min. After removal of the supernatant, the transfected cells were lysed in 800 ul PBS with 1% Triton and protease inhibitor (Roche cOmplete EDTA-free tablets), and cleared of debris by spinning in a table-top centrifuge (Eppendorf 5424R) at top speed (20,000 x g, average) for 10 min.
Proteins in VLP and cell lysate samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, as follows: 20 ul of unboiled VLP and cell lysate samples on a 10%–20% Tris-Glycine gel to probe for the M protein; 2 ul of boiled cell lysate and 5 ul of boiled VLP samples on a 12% Tris-Glycine gel to probe for the N protein; 20 ul of boiled lysate and VLP samples on a 10% Tris-Glycine gel to probe for the S protein; 5 ul of boiled lysate on a 10% Tris-Glycine gel to probe for Raptor, as a loading control. Proteins were electro-transferred from the gels to PVDF membrane, which was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-Buffered Saline, pH 8.0, with 0.1% Tween-20, and detected with the indicated antibodies.
Binding kinetics and affinities for ACE2.Fc were assessed using surface plasmon resonance technology on a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA) using a Series S CM5 sensor chip in filtered and degassed HBS-EP running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) polysorbate 20, pH 7.4). Capture sensor surfaces were prepared by covalently immobilizing with a mouse anti-human Fc mAb (REGN2567) on the chip surface using the standard amine coupling chemistry, reported previously ( Johnsson et al., 1991 21. Johnsson, B. ∙ Löfås, S. ∙ Lindquist, G. Immobilization of proteins to a carboxymethyldextran-modified gold surface for biospecific interaction analysis in surface plasmon resonance sensors Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198 :268-277 Crossref Scopus (1228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following surface activation, the remaining active carboxyl groups on the CM5 chip surface were blocked by injecting 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0 for 7 min. A typical resonance unit (RU) signal of ∼12,000 RU was achieved after the immobilization procedure. At the end of each cycle, the anti-human Fc surface was regenerated using a 12 s injection of 20 mM phosphoric acid. Following the capture of the ACE2.Fc on the anti-human Fc mAb immobilized surface, 0.78 nM - 50 nM, two-fold serial dilutions, in duplicate, of soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer protein, D614 or D614G, were injected for 3 min at a flow rate of 50 mL/min, with a 2 min dissociation phase in the running buffer. All specific SPR binding sensorgrams were double-reference subtracted as reported previously ( Myszka, 1999 30. Myszka, D.G. Improving biosensor analysis J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12 :279-284 Crossref Scopus (672) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the kinetic parameters were obtained by globally fitting the double-reference subtracted data to a 1:1 binding model with mass transport limitation using Biacore T200 Evaluation software v 3.1 (GE Healthcare). The dissociation rate constant ( k d ) was determined by fitting the change in the binding response during the dissociation phase and the association rate constant ( k a ) was determined by globally fitting analyte binding at different concentrations. The equilibrium dissociation constant ( K D ) was calculated from the ratio of the k d and k a . The dissociative half-life (t ¾¾¾ ) in minutes was calculated as ln2/( k d ∗ 60). The steady state analysis was performed using Scrubber software and the K D value was determined.
FreeStyle 293-F cells were cultured in SMM-293 TII serum-free media (SinoBiological) and maintained in a 37°C shaker with 8% CO 2 and 80% humidity. 600 ug of plasmid encoding His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S protein was transfected into 400 mL of 293 FreeStyle cells at 10 6 cells/mL, using 25 mL Opti-MEM and 1.8 mL PEI. 60 h later, the media was collected and applied to 3 mL of Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN). The resin was collected and washed with PBS supplemented with 20 mM imidazole. Soluble S protein was eluted in PBS supplemented with 200 mM imidazole, and further enriched using a Superose 6 gel-filtration column (GE healthcare), in a buffer containing 25 mM NaHEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl. Yield was roughly 600 ug of soluble S protein homotrimer per liter of culture.
3 μL of enriched D614G trimers, at 2.5 mg/mL, was deposited on an UltrAuFoil R1.2/1.3 300 mesh grid that had been glow discharged for 30 s in a GloQube Plus Glow Discharge System. Plunge freezing was performed with a Vitrobot Mark IV using a blot force 0 and 5 s blot time at 100% humidity and 4°C. Frozen grids were imaged with a Thermo Scientific KriosRx Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscope (Cryo-TEM) operated at a fixed 300 kV, and images were recorded with a Falcon 4 Direct Electron Detector. Movies were acquired using EPU 2 software. 10,264 micrographs were automatically collected with a defocus ranging between 0.6 and 1.8 μm, at a nominal magnification of 155,000x with a pixel size of 0.52Å. 7,653 micrographs were collected with a tilt-angle of 30° to overcome the preferred orientation. The dose rate was set at 20.3 electron/Å 2 /s and total exposure time was 1.81 s. With a dose fraction set at 62 frames, each movie series contained 62 frames and each frame received a dose of 0.6 electron/Å 2 .
Movie frame alignment, estimation of microscope contrast-transfer function parameters, particle picking, 2D classification, and homogeneous refinement using the published structure EMD-21452 as initial model were carried out in cryoSPARC. Ensemble averaging of 266,356 particles resulted in a 3.7Å map with C3 symmetry imposed according to “gold standard” Fourier shell correlation of 0.143. Local resolution was estimated using cryoSPARC to extend from 3Å to 6 Å. Particle stacks with well-refined orientation parameters were imported in Relion3.1. Focused 3D classifications with a soft mask on the S1 subunit of the protomer were performed on the C3 symmetry expanded particles. Two monomer conformations, namely the closed state (a) and the open state (b) were identified after 3 rounds of classification. Four trimer classes were identified by 3D classification on the trimer particles: class_3a (13,555 particles), class_3b (51,600 particles), class_2a1b (96,029 particles), class_1a2b (105,118 particles). Homogeneous refinements were then performed on these 4 classes, with EMD-21452 as the initial model in Relion3.1. C3 symmetry was imposed on the refinement of particles from class_3a and class_3b; C1 symmetry was imposed on the refinement of particles from class_2a1b and class_1a2b. The final resolutions were class_1a2b with 4Å, class_2a1b with 3.9Å, class_3a with 4.2Å and class_3b with 3.9Å. The final map was deposited with the accession code EMD-22301.
Atomic models were prepared with Coot based on the resolved structure of D614 SARS-CoV-2 Spike (PDB: 6vxx and 6vsb ). Real-space refinements were performed using PHENIX with secondary structure restraints. MolProbity was used to evaluate the geometries of the structural model. Corrected Fourier shell correlation curves were calculated using the refined atomic model and the cryo-EM density map. The coordinates were deposited with the accession code 6XS6. To validate the structural model, the following analysis was performed to validate the map resolution and prevent overfitting: (1) “Gold Standard” FSC curve (Figure S1E); (2) Docking previously resolved structures into the map and checking the appearance of expected structure elements; (3) Model-to-map (Figure S1G) and map-to-map FSC curves (Figure S1F). All the results validated the map and model.
GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 was used to analyze the infectivity data using a ratio paired t test. In these experiments, all values shown are the mean with standard deviation, with the actual calculated two-tailed P value indicated on the figure.
