Title: EMSY inhibits homologous recombination repair and the interferon response, promoting lung cancer immune evasion


Abstract: Summary

Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring KEAP1 mutations are often resistant to immunotherapy. Here, we show that KEAP1 targets EMSY for ubiquitin-mediated degradation to regulate homologous recombination repair (HRR) and anti-tumor immunity. Loss of KEAP1 in NSCLC induces stabilization of EMSY, producing a BRCAness phenotype, i.e., HRR defects and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Defective HRR contributes to a high tumor mutational burden that, in turn, is expected to prompt an innate immune response. Notably, EMSY accumulation suppresses the type I interferon response and impairs innate immune signaling, fostering cancer immune evasion. Activation of the type I interferon response in the tumor microenvironment using a STING agonist results in the engagement of innate and adaptive immune signaling and impairs the growth of KEAP1 -mutant tumors. Our results suggest that targeting PARP and STING pathways, individually or in combination, represents a therapeutic strategy in NSCLC patients harboring alterations in KEAP1 .

Section: Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide ( Bar et al., 2008 3. Bar, J. ∙ Herbst, R.S. ∙ Onn, A. Multitargeted inhibitors in lung cancer: new clinical data Clin.

NSCLCs are subdivided into lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs; ∼50%), lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSCs; ∼30%), and others (∼20%).
Among the emerging targeted therapies, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) represents a promising approach, eliciting durable anti-tumor immune responses in multiple tumor types, including lung cancer ( Zappasodi et al., 2018 54.

NSCLCs are characterized by a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) ( Alexandrov et al., 2013 1.

A high TMB is expected to induce an anti-tumor response, and, in fact, it represents a biomarker predicting favorable responses to ICB ( Berland et al., 2019 4.

However, despite the significant survival benefit of ICB for a substantial fraction of patients with advanced NSCLC, a large number of patients exhibit primary resistance ( Heeke et al., 2019 24.

Among the major lung cancer drivers, the tumor suppressor KEAP1 is mutated in ∼20% of NSCLC patients and is the third most frequently mutated gene in LUAD ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014 8. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma Nature. 2014; 511 :543-550 Crossref Scopus (4099) PubMed Google Scholar ). KEAP1 is a substrate receptor of a CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) that constitutively targets NRF2 (encoded by NFE2L2 ) for degradation, ensuring redox homeostasis ( Harris and DeNicola, 2020 22.

Med. 2017; 23 :1362-1368 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since NRF2 is the most well-characterized substrate of KEAP1, it is commonly assumed that tumors harboring mutations in both KEAP1 and NRF2 display similar features. However, only NSCLCs with KEAP1 mutations, but not those with NRF2 mutations, exhibit a significant negative association with the clinical T cell-inflamed GEP (gene expression profile) score ( Chen et al., 2020 10.

Moreover, mutations in KEAP1 specifically correlate with lower immune infiltration and immune evasion, and KEAP1 -mutant NSCLCs display resistance to ICB ( Bagaev et al., 2021 2.

These observations suggest that KEAP1 -inactivating mutations and NRF2 -activating mutations do not produce identical phenotypes and that KEAP1, but not NRF2, plays a role in regulating anti-tumor immunity.
Over the last decade, synthetic lethality approaches have been developed for the treatment of tumors defective in homologous recombination repair (HRR). One such approach involves the pharmacological inhibition of PARP1, a key DNA repair enzyme ( Lord and Ashworth, 2016 35. Lord, C.J. ∙ Ashworth, A. BRCAness revisited Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :110-120 Crossref Scopus (934) PubMed Google Scholar ). So far, PARP inhibitors (PARPis) have been approved only for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, two major regulators of HRR ( Byrum et al., 2019 6. Byrum, A.K. ∙ Vindigni, A. ∙ Mosammaparast, N.

Targets. 2019; 23 :773-785 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the use of PARPis in the clinic has excluded BRCA-proficient cancers, several recent preclinical and clinical studies have begun to expand this narrow therapeutic scope. Strategies include identifying cancers with defects in HRR that produce a BRCAness phenotype in the absence of BRCA mutations, sensitizing these tumors to PARP inhibition ( Byrum et al., 2019 6.

Relatedly, EMSY is the product of a proto-oncogene whose locus is frequently amplified in ovarian and other human cancers ( Dansonka-Mieszkowska et al., 2018 14.

EMSY physically interacts with and inhibits BRCA2’s activity, and its overexpression induces a BRCAness phenotype ( Jelinic et al., 2017 29. Jelinic, P. ∙ Eccles, L.A. ∙ Tseng, J. ...

Livingston, D.M. EMSY, a BRCA-2 partner in crime Nat. Med. 2004; 10 :127-128 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, EMSY is part of several chromatin remodeling complexes and acts as a negative regulator of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) ( Ezell et al., 2012 17.

Notably, anti-tumor immune responses are known to activate damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), among which type I interferon (IFN) is a major factor in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses ( Saleiro and Platanias, 2019 45.

We found that CRL3 KEAP1 targets EMSY for degradation and that loss of KEAP1 inhibits both the HRR and the IFN response in an EMSY-dependent manner. Moreover, EMSY accumulation in KEAP1 -mutant NSCLCs sensitizes them to PARPis and a STING agonist. The results of these studies are presented herein.

Section: Results

NSCLCs are known to display a high TMB; however, the contribution of specific driver mutations to TMB remains unclear. To this end, we evaluated the TMB distribution across the major drivers of NSCLC using patient data from TCGA database stratified in non-smoker and smoker ( Figures S1 A and S1B). KEAP1 -mutant tumors displayed the highest and the third highest TMBs within the non-smoker and smoker groups, respectively, suggesting that this specific genetic background is instrumental in establishing a high TMB ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Mutations in KEAP1 correlated with an increase in the TMB both in LUADs and LUSCs ( Figure 1 A). In contrast, NSCLCs with activating mutations in NRF2 did not show any increase in TMB ( Figure 1 B). Given that TP53, a major regulator of the DNA-damage response, is mutated in >50% of NSCLCs ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014 8. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma Nature. 2014; 511 :543-550 Crossref Scopus (4099) PubMed Google Scholar ), we stratified NSCLCs according to their TP53 status. Compared with tumors with wild-type KEAP1 , KEAP1- mutated tumors displayed a high TMB independently of their TP53 status ( Figure 1 C). This was not observed for any other driver except for FAT1 ( Figure S1 C). Next, we employed a mouse model to assess the TMB in the context of Keap1 deficiency. To this end, we utilized the KP ( Kras LSL-G12D/+ ; Trp53 flox/flox ) genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM)-derived cell-line system ( Romero et al., 2017 44. Romero, R. ∙ Sayin, V.I. ∙ Davidson, S.M. ... Keap1 loss promotes Kras-driven lung cancer and results in dependence on glutaminolysis Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1362-1368 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate Keap1 knockout (KPK) clones ( Figure S1 D) whose TMB was assessed using whole-exome sequencing. Consistent with TCGA data, KPK clones displayed a ∼3-fold increase in TMB compared with KP cells ( Figure 1 D), the latter representing KP parental cells (KP0) subjected to mock CRISPR-Cas9 transfection. KPK cells also showed an increase in TMB when the number of mutations in coding sequences were quantified using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data ( Figure 1 E). Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis from the same RNA-seq datasets showed downregulation of gene sets for pathways involved in HRR and double-strand break (DSB) repair in Keap1 −/− tumors ( Figure 1 F). Finally, using patient data from TCGA ( Thorsson et al., 2019 48. Thorsson, V. ∙ Gibbs, D.L. ∙ Brown, S.D. ..., Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network The Immune Landscape of Cancer Immunity. 2019; 51 :411-412 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed that KEAP1 -mutated NSCLCs displayed an increase in the HRD (homologous-recombination deficiency) score compared with KEAP1 wild-type tumors ( Figure 1 G).
Taken together, the above results show that KEAP1 -mutant tumors display a high TMB and an impairment in the pathways involved in DNA-repair pathways, particularly HRR.
We observed that KEAP1 -depleted cells exhibited a significant decrease in HRR efficiency measured with a GFP-based reporter ( Pierce et al., 1999 40. Pierce, A.J. ∙ Johnson, R.D. ∙ Thompson, L.H. ... XRCC3 promotes homology-directed repair of DNA damage in mammalian cells Genes Dev. 1999; 13 :2633-2638 Crossref Scopus (1125) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). Accordingly, in response to the DNA-damaging agent neocarzinostatin (NCS), compared with KP cells, KPK cells showed an impairment in Rad51 foci formation, as well as Rad51 loading to the chromatin, but displayed efficient phosphorylation of H2ax at Ser139 (pH2ax) ( Figures 2 B, S2 B, and S2C).
In agreement with the synthetic lethality between HRR defects and PARPis, we found that, compared with KP cells, KPK cells showed a dose-dependent enhanced sensitivity to PARPi treatment ( Figures 2 C and S2 D–S2G). In contrast to KPK, stable expression of a non-degradable Nrf2 mutant or the pharmacological activation of Nrf2 did not increase the sensitivity of KP cells to PARPi ( Figures 2 C, S2 H, and S2I). These results suggest that both the HRR defect and the PARPi sensitivity observed in Keap1- null cells were not due to the upregulation of Nrf2. In line with our in vitro results, subcutaneously transplanted KPK tumors showed sensitivity to PARPi compared with KP tumors ( Figures 2 D, 2E, S2 J, and S2K). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis revealed that PARPi-treated KPK tumors displayed an accumulation of pH2ax ( Figure S2 L), in agreement with the defective HRR necessary to repair PARPi-induced DNA damage in KPK tumors. Using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we similarly found that tumors derived from a human LUAD harboring an inactivating mutation in KEAP1 were sensitive to PARPi, similar to tumors derived from a LUAD with an inactivating mutation in ATM , a well-established BRCAness gene ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S2 M).
Moreover, compared with orthotopically transplanted KP lung tumors, KPK tumors showed sensitivity to PARPis ( Figure 2 H), concomitant with enhanced survival ( Figure 2 I). Finally, the reconstitution of Keap1 in KPK cells rescued the PARPi sensitivity in vivo ( Figures 2 J and 2K) and the ability of these cells to form Rad51 foci upon DNA damage ( Figure S2 N).
Taken together, these results suggest that KEAP1 -mutated tumors display a BRCAness phenotype characterized by HRR defects and a sensitivity to PARPi. The HRR defects observed in KEAP1 -depleted cells may explain the increased TMB observed in KEAP1 -mutant NSCLC patients.
We sought to identify CRL3 KEAP1 substrates whose accumulation could explain the Nrf2-independent BRCAness phenotypes observed in Keap1 -null cells. We expressed FLAG-tagged KEAP1 in HEK293T cells and subjected the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates to mass spectrometry analysis. Among the proteins identified in the KEAP1 complex (including known interactors), we found several peptides corresponding to EMSY ( Figure S3 A), which attracted our attention because of its ability to inhibit BRCA2. Finally, upon immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged EMSY, we identified KEAP1 in addition to known interactors ( Figure S3 B). We validated the interaction between KEAP1 and EMSY and found that cancer-associated KEAP1 mutants displayed an impairment in EMSY binding ( Figures 3 A–3D, S3 C, and S3D). EMSY levels increased in cells treated either with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or with the CRLs inhibitor MLN4924 ( Figures S3 E and S3F). K EAP1 -depleted U2OS cells displayed high levels of EMSY protein compared with KEAP1 wild-type controls ( Figure 3 E). Accordingly, analyses of cell lysates from the previously analyzed PDXs ( Figures 2 F and 2G) and from KPK cells confirmed increased EMSY/Emsy levels compared with controls ( Figures 3 F, 3G, and S1 D). Importantly, the re-expression of Keap1 was sufficient to decrease Emsy protein levels in KPK cells ( Figure 3 H).
KEAP1 is a master regulator of the cellular redox state and contains cysteines that are oxidized in response to oxidative stress, leading to KEAP1 inactivation ( Harris and DeNicola, 2020 22.

Med. 2017; 23 :1362-1368 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ). H 2 O 2 -treated cells displayed a rapid and transient accumulation of EMSY levels ( Figures 3 I and S3 G). In contrast, when KEAP1 was silenced, basal EMSY levels were higher and did not fluctuate upon oxidative stress induction ( Figures 3 I and S3 G). We also found that KEAP1 expression induced the appearance of ubiquitylated species of EMSY ( Figure S3 H). Importantly, these ubiquitylated species were not present when KEAP1 mutants, unable to assemble an active CRL3 complex, were expressed. The increase in EMSY ubiquitylation upon KEAP1 transfection was inhibited by the addition of the CRLs inhibitor MLN4924 ( Figure 3 J). Finally, in line with the hypothesis that EMSY is a CRL3 KEAP1 substrate, we found that human NSCLCs with mutations in KEAP1 displayed higher levels of EMSY compared with wild-type controls ( Figure 3 K).
Altogether, the above results demonstrate that KEAP1 controls the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of EMSY.
To evaluate if the inhibition of the KEAP1-mediated degradation of EMSY affects PARPi sensitivity, rather than silencing KEAP1 (which would affect the stability of multiple substrates), we generated a stable Emsy mutant that does not bind Keap1 and is insensitive to its degradation. Thus, we mapped the Keap1-binding motif in Emsy. Emsy contains five motifs that display homology with Nrf2 degron (ETGE) ( Figure S4 A). Alanine substitution of the four amino acids in these five motifs showed that EEGE in position 871–874 is necessary for the interaction with Keap1 ( Figures 4 A and S4 B). Accordingly, compared with its wild-type counterpart, levels of Emsy(EEGE/AAAA) were markedly elevated and did not oscillate upon induction of oxidative stress ( Figure 4 B).
Following genotoxic stress, the formation of Rad51 foci, but not of pH2ax foci, was impaired in KP cells expressing Emsy(EEGE/AAAA) ( Figures 4 C and S4 C), suggesting an impairment in HRR. Subcutaneously transplanted KP tumors stably infected with Emsy(EEGE/AAAA) displayed an impairment in their growth upon treatment with PARPi ( Figures 4 D and 4E), similar to what we observed in KPK tumors ( Figures 2 D, 2E, 2 H–2K, S2 J, and S2K), indicating that EMSY protein levels are critical determinants of PARPi sensitivity.
We also found that Emsy silencing significantly decreased the sensitivity of KPK cells to PARPi in cultured cells ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Moreover, in vivo depletion of Emsy completely rescued the PARPi sensitivity of KPK tumors, while KP tumors remained insensitive ( Figures 4 F, 4G, S4 F, and S4G). In line with this finding, IHC analysis revealed that downregulation of Emsy rescued the accumulation of pH2ax in PARPi-treated KPK tumors ( Figure S4 H) without affecting Ki67 levels ( Figure S4 I).
Overall, the above results indicate that the BRCAness phenotype observed in Keap1 -deficient cells is due to the stabilization of Emsy. Accordingly, co-silencing of EMSY in KEAP1 -depleted double repeat (DR)-GFP cells rescued the HRR defects due to KEAP1 depletion ( Figure 4 H).
We noticed that depletion of Emsy induced a significant reduction of the tumor burden in KPK tumors but not in KP tumors ( Figures 4 F, 4G, S4 F, and S4G). This result suggested that while Emsy accumulation promotes genomic instability by inhibiting HRR, it also sustains KPK tumor growth without altering cell proliferation, as assessed by detecting Ki67 levels ( Figure S4 I). In line with our in vitro results, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of an RNA-seq transcriptional profiling showed a downregulation of both DSB repair and HRR in KPK tumors compared with KP tumors ( Figure S5 A). Moreover, GSEA revealed a downregulation of an IFN signature in KPK tumors ( Figure S5 A). Interestingly, GSEA also uncovered a significant enrichment of the IFN and the innate immune gene signatures upon Emsy silencing in KPK tumors but not in KP sh Emsy tumors ( Figure 5 A). We also found that genes containing interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and genes regulated by the interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) were the top enriched gene sets in KPK sh Emsy compared with KPK sh control (shCTRL) ( Figures 5 B and 5C). This trend was not detected in shEmsy-expressing KP versus shCTRL-expressing KP tumors ( Figure S5 B). These results are in line with reports showing that EMSY is a transcriptional repressor of ISGs ( Ezell et al., 2012 17. Ezell, S.A. ∙ Polytarchou, C. ∙ Hatziapostolou, M. ...

Intriguingly, GSEA using TCGA patient data revealed that KEAP1 -mutant tumors display a significant downregulation of genes involved in the IFN alpha response and the inflammatory response, as well as genes regulated by IRFs ( Figure 5 D).
Taken together, these results indicate that Keap1 -null tumors are characterized by suppression of the IFN response resulting from the stabilization of Emsy.
To test the ability of KP and KPK cells to induce an IFN response, we stimulated them with poly(G:C), a synthetic double-stranded DNA composed of repeating GC units. poly(G:C) mimics viral infection and activates cGAS/STING-mediated production of IFN. We observed a Keap1-dependent degradation of Emsy upon stimulation with poly(G:C) ( Figures 5 E and S5 C), which was confirmed using poly(ISD) (interferon stimulatory DNA) ( Figures 5 E and S5 C). Moreover, poly(G:C) induced a time-dependent ubiquitylation of Emsy concomitant with an increased binding to Keap1 ( Figures 5 F and S5 D–S5F). poly(G:C)-mediated ubiquitylation of Emsy was abolished in Keap1 -null cells ( Figure S5 F). These results indicate that KEAP1 induces the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of EMSY in response to cytoplasmic DNA.
Since IFN signaling requires the cGAS/STING-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the IRF3, we used an Irf3-dependent ISRE luciferase reporter to measure IFN activation. We observed a dramatic reduction in both Ifnα- and poly(G:C)-induced ISRE activation in KPK cells but not in KP cells ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Upon binding to DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP, which acts as a second messenger that binds and activates STING, which in turn stimulates the TBK1 complex, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor IRF3 ( Cai et al., 2014 7. Cai, X. ∙ Chiu, Y.H. ∙ Chen, Z.J. The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing and signaling Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :289-296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (742) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2016 9. Chen, Q. ∙ Sun, L. ∙ Chen, Z.J. Regulation and function of the cGAS-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1142-1149 Crossref Scopus (1365) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that poly(G:C) induced an upregulation of cGas protein levels ( Figure 5 E) concomitant with the production of cGAMP ( Figure S5 G) and the phosphorylation of Sting and Tbk1 in both KP and KPK cells ( Figure 5 E). Interestingly, while KP cells display a proper phosphorylation of Irf3, we observed an impairment in the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of Irf3 in KPK cells ( Figures 5 E, S5 H, and S5I). Similar results were obtained with poly(ISD) and in human cells ( Figures 5 E and S5 C). A poly(G:C) time course in Keap1 -null cells revealed a pronounced decrease in the expression of Ifnα , IFN-stimulated cytokines (i.e., Ccl5 and Cxcl10 ), and ISGs (i.e., Isg15 , Isg54 , and Isg56 ) ( Figure S6 A). Importantly, re-expression of Keap1 rescued both the mRNA expression and secretion of Ifnα in KPK cells ( Figures 5 I and 5J), showing that Keap1 regulates type I IFN signaling.
IFN acts in a paracrine or autocrine manner, binding cell-surface receptors and triggering the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 by JAK. Upon activation by phosphorylation, STAT1 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, promoting transcription of specific ISGs. We transferred conditioned media from poly(G:C)-treated KP or KPK cells to cultures of untreated KP or KPK cells. We found that untreated KP and KPK recipient cells displayed an increase in the levels of phospho-Stat1 (Y701) only when they were treated with media collected from poly(G:C)-treated KP cells but not with media collected from poly(G:C)-treated KPK cells ( Figure S6 B). This result suggests that although Keap1 -null cells are partially able to respond to IFNs, they are defective in the production and secretion of soluble IFNs.
Expression of a non-degradable Nrf2 mutant did not affect IFN signaling, while it did induce, as expected, Nqo1 expression ( Figures S6 C and S6D). In contrast, poly(G:C)-treated KP cells stably expressing a non-degradable Emsy displayed an impairment in both the mRNA expression and the secretion of Ifnα ( Figures 6 A and S6 E). Accordingly, silencing of Emsy in KPK cells rescued Ifnα expression upon stimulation with poly(G:C) ( Figure 6 B).
Taken together, these results suggest that the KEAP1-dependent degradation of EMSY is crucial for the efficient activation of a type I IFN response.
We reasoned that suppression of IFN signaling caused by EMSY accumulation could contribute to the immune evasion observed in KEAP1 -null NSCLCs ( Cristescu et al., 2018 12. Cristescu, R. ∙ Mogg, R. ∙ Ayers, M. ... Pan-tumor genomic biomarkers for PD-1 checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapy Science. 2018; 362 :eaar3593 Crossref Scopus (1520) PubMed Google Scholar ; Papillon-Cavanagh et al., 2020 39. Papillon-Cavanagh, S. ∙ Doshi, P. ∙ Dobrin, R. ... STK11 and KEAP1 mutations as prognostic biomarkers in an observational real-world lung adenocarcinoma cohort ESMO Open. 2020; 5 :e000706 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we asked whether Emsy downregulation was able to impair the growth of KPK tumors in the absence of a functional immune system. We found that in immunodeficient mice (Prkdc scid ; Il2rg tm1Wjl , NSG mice), sh Emsy KP and KPK tumors display a growth comparable to that of shCTRL tumors ( Figures 6 C and 6D). This is in contrast to what we observed in immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice ( Figures 4 F and 4G). These findings suggest that the compromised growth of Keap1 -null tumors following Emsy depletion is dependent on a functional immune system. Emsy knockdown did not affect the in vitro proliferation of KP and KPK cells ( Figure S6 F). The lack of any effect on cell proliferation both in vitro and in NSG mice is in agreement with the hypothesis that Emsy deficiency impairs tumor growth in a non-cell autonomous manner.
Next, we employed type I interferon-α/β receptor ( Ifnar1) knockout mice, which display severely attenuated IFN/JAK-STAT signaling and defective innate immunity. In this model, type I IFN receptor signaling can be intact in transplanted tumor cells, but it is deficient in the mouse tumor microenvironment (TME). While the growth defect due to Emsy depletion in KPK tumors was maintained in Ifnar1 wild-type littermates, the growth of KPK tumors was not significantly affected by Emsy depletion in Ifnar1 -null mice ( Figures 6 E and 6F). These findings corroborate the hypothesis that the tumor-suppressive effects of Emsy depletion on KPK tumors rely on a functional type I IFN response in the TME and further reinforce the mechanistic connection between EMSY-mediated immune evasion and IFN signaling.
Consistent with a role of Emsy in promoting lung cancer immune evasion, sh Emsy KPK lung tumors displayed an impairment in their growth compared with shCTRL KPK tumors in an immunocompetent orthotopic model ( Figure 6 G). Upon examination of the immune infiltrate, relative to KP controls, KPK tumors exhibited a significant increase in the expression of Cd206+, a marker associated with M2-like, pro-tumorigenic macrophages and a significant decrease in tumor-infiltrating Cd8+ T cells and overall leukocytes ( Figures 6 H, 6I, and S6 G), consistent with global immune suppression reported in the TME of KPK tumors. Emsy knockdown in KPK tumors reversed the increase in Cd206+ M2-like macrophages and restored the Cd8+ T cell population, strongly suggesting that the immune-suppressive phenotype of KPK tumors is Emsy -dependent. Emsy knockdown in KPK tumors also resulted in an overall increase in the expression of IFN signaling activating markers (pTbk1 and pIrf3) in various myeloid populations ( Figures S6 H–S6J).
Taken together, these results suggest that the overexpression of Emsy in Keap1 -mutant tumors promotes cancer immune evasion through the suppression of type I IFN signaling.
Activation of the STING pathway with a STING agonist (STINGa) not only promotes type I IFN production in cancer cells but also directly activates anti-tumor immune cells and stimulates the trafficking and infiltration of T cells to the TME ( Zhu et al. (2019) 55. Zhu, Y. ∙ An, X. ∙ Zhang, X. ... STING: a master regulator in the cancer-immunity cycle Mol. Cancer. 2019; 18 :152 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar . Thus, we hypothesized that activating a type I IFN response in the TME through STING engagement could stimulate an innate and adaptive immune response. Thus, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the STINGa DMXAA ( Daei Farshchi Adli et al., 2018 13. Daei Farshchi Adli, A. ∙ Jahanban-Esfahlan, R. ∙ Seidi, K. ... An overview on Vadimezan (DMXAA): The vascular disrupting agent Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2018; 91 :996-1006 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) in an orthotopic setting. We observed that KPK lung tumors, but not KP lung tumors, displayed sensitivity to STINGa ( Figure 7 A). We then conducted 10x single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of KP and KPK tumors to evaluate changes in the TME. A total of 7,586 live leukocytes (Cd45+, PI-neg) were analyzed, including macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, Cd4+ T cells, Cd8+ T cells, NK cells, B cells, and other less abundant lineages. The distribution of cellular clusters was at first determined using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) algorithm, with each cluster identified by a distinct color ( Figure S7 A; Table S1 ). Cell identities were determined using characteristic gene markers across all conditions ( Figure S7 B; Table S2 ). However, using tSNE analysis alone, it was difficult to visualize a clear separation between certain lymphocytic and NK clusters. We therefore employed a K-nearest-neighbor-based network graph-drawing layout (KNetL) analysis to display a better separation of leukocytes ( Figure 7 B). A relative fractional comparison revealed a significant expansion of pro-tumorigenic immune populations in untreated KPK tumors relative to untreated KP controls, such as M2-like macrophages (cluster 6) and neutrophils (cluster 15) and a contraction of anti-tumor immune cells, such as memory T cells (cluster 17) ( Figure 7 C). STINGa treatment reversed the expansion of mediators of immune suppression observed in KPK tumors ( Figure 7 C). Furthermore, KPK tumors treated with STINGa displayed a significant increase in IFN-induced dendritic cells (cluster 8), NK cells (cluster 10), memory T cells, and activated T cells (clusters 17 and 19) ( Figure 7 C).
We also performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis on the lungs of KP and KPK tumor-bearing animals. We found that untreated KPK tumors exhibited a significant reduction in Cd3+ T cell infiltrate and IFN-signaling pTbk1 in myeloid cells compared with KP controls ( Figures 7 D and 7E). STINGa administration increased the proportion of tumor-infiltrating T cells and pTbk1 expression in myeloid cells in KPK tumors but had no effect on these populations in KP tumors. STINGa treatment did not affect the in vitro viability of either KP or KPK cells ( Figure S7 C), in agreement with the idea that STINGa acts through the immune cells and not directly on the cancer cells. Altogether, these data suggest that the activation of IFN signaling upon STINGa treatment could influence both the innate and adaptive immune responses, in agreement with the role of IFN in bridging these two responses ( Snell et al., 2017 46. Snell, L.M. ∙ McGaha, T.L. ∙ Brooks, D.G. Type I Interferon in Chronic Virus Infection and Cancer Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :542-557 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Next, we investigated the efficacy of STINGa in combination with PARPi, aiming to exploit both vulnerabilities of Keap1- null tumors (i.e., the BRCAness phenotype and the impaired IFN signaling). In line with previous results, when administered as single agents, STINGa and PARPi elicited a reduction in the growth of KPK tumors ( Figures 7 F and 7G) but not KP tumors ( Figures S7 D and S7E). The combination treatment displayed a further reduction in the burden of KPK tumors, which coincided with an increase in apoptotic cell death ( Figures 7 F, 7G, and S7 F).
Taken together, these results support the rationale for combining treatment with PARPi (which induces the death of cancer cells) and STINGa (which activate the immune cells) in NSCLC tumors with inactivating mutations in KEAP1 .

Section: Discussion

Our results reveal that the loss of KEAP1 induces defects in HRR, which may explain, at least in part, the high TMB observed in KEAP1 -mutated NSCLCs. Mechanistically, the inability of KEAP1 -null cells to properly execute HRR is driven by the accumulation of EMSY, which is a pro-oncogenic chromatin remodeler that promotes a BRCAness phenotype ( Jelinic et al., 2017 29. Jelinic, P. ∙ Eccles, L.A. ∙ Tseng, J. ... The EMSY threonine 207 phospho-site is required for EMSYdriven suppression of DNA damage repair Oncotarget. 2017; 8 :13792-13804 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kondrashova and Scott, 2019 30.

Livingston, D.M. EMSY, a BRCA-2 partner in crime Nat. Med. 2004; 10 :127-128 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with the well-established synthetic lethality between HRR defects and PARPis, we demonstrate that KEAP1 -null tumor cells are sensitive to PARPis both in vitro and in vivo .
Despite TMB being an important determinant of immunotherapy response, NSCLCs are often resistant to ICB, particularly the KEAP1 -mutated subtype ( Bagaev et al., 2021 2. Bagaev, A. ∙ Kotlov, N. ∙ Nomie, K. ...

STK11 and KEAP1 mutations as prognostic biomarkers in an observational real-world lung adenocarcinoma cohort ESMO Open. 2020; 5 :e000706 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that the accumulation of EMSY promotes the growth of KEAP1 -mutated tumor cells in vivo but not in vitro . Stabilization of EMSY in KEAP1 -null cells compromises the activation of the IFN response, thereby suppressing innate immunity and promoting cancer immune evasion. In agreement with our findings, it has been reported that EMSY is a transcriptional repressor of ISGs to control antiviral immunity ( Ezell et al., 2012 17. Ezell, S.A. ∙ Polytarchou, C. ∙ Hatziapostolou, M. ... The protein kinase Akt1 regulates the interferon response through phosphorylation of the transcriptional repressor EMSY Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E613-E621 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ezell and Tsichlis, 2012 15. Ezell, S.A. ∙ Tsichlis, P.N. Akt1, EMSY, BRCA2 and type I IFN signaling: a novel arm of the IFN response Transcription. 2012; 3 :305-309 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
We reasoned that the activation of the IFN response in the TME with a STINGa may counteract the pro-oncogenic activity of EMSY in the cancer cell and stimulate anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, we found that orthotopically implanted KPK lung tumors displayed a sensitivity to the FDA-approved STINGa DMXAA due to an engagement of anti-tumor immune signaling in the TME. KP tumors do not have a defective IFN pathway; therefore, this does not appear to be a vulnerability in this tumor type.
We demonstrate that the stabilization of EMSY, and not the accumulation of NRF2, is responsible for both the BRCAness phenotype and the suppression of IFN signaling observed in Keap1 -null cells. Therefore, our findings implicate an unexpected, NRF2-independent role for KEAP1 in suppressing IFN-dependent immune responses.
In summary, we have identified a molecular mechanism by which mutations in KEAP1 promote lung cancer immune evasion. Specifically, the loss of KEAP1 induces the stabilization of EMSY, which in turn produces a BRCAness phenotype characterized by HRR defects ( Figure 7 H) and sensitivity to PARPi. The defect in HRR contributes to an increased TMB, which is known to activate the innate immune pathways. However, we found that the accumulation of EMSY observed in KEAP1 -null cells negatively regulates the IFN response, suppressing innate immunity and promoting immune evasion ( Figure 7 H). Thus, the stabilization of EMSY in KEAP1 -null cells results in two synergistic, pro-oncogenic phenotypes that drive tumor progression by promoting both genome instability and suppression of the innate immunity.
We showed that the loss of KEAP1 leads to EMSY accumulation with consequent inhibition of HRR, as well as the IFN response and innate immunity. EMSY is thought to regulates HRR by physically interacting with BRCA2. EMSY is also a transcriptional repressor that is part of several chromatin-bound complexes, in agreement with our observation that EMSY inhibits the IFN response at a transcriptional level. BRCA2 also plays a role in transcriptional regulation. So, it is possible that EMSY’s role in regulating DDR and innate immunity involves its ability to form distinct chromatin-bound complexes (including with BRCA2) with specific functions. The characterization of these complexes and the DNA regions they bind will require further work. We also observed an impairment in the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of Irf3 in KPK cells. These defects may be due to Irf3’s inability to bind repressed target genes, which in turn promotes its de-phosphorylation. Additional investigations are necessary to evaluate this hypothesis.

Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 200 μM, Doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 5 μM, Neocarzinostatin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 100 ng/mL, MLN4924 (Active Biochem) at 2 μM and MG132 (Peptides International) at 10 μM. 6x 10 5 cells were transfected with 2 μg of poly(G:C) or poly(ISD). Cells were periodically screened for Mycoplasma contamination. No cell lines used in this study were found in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample. Specific details about cell lines used are provided in the Key resource table .
Female C57BL/6J, NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ and B6(Cg)- Ifnar1 tm1.2Ees /J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were housed in pathogen-free rodent facilities at NYU Langone Health. All supplies (cages, chow, and sterile water) were autoclaved, and mice were housed in sterile conditions within high-efficiency particulate arrestance filtered micro-isolators and fed with irradiated food and acidified water. All experiments were conducted according to standard protocols outlined by the University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals.
5x10 5 cells were implanted subcutaneously into 6- to 8-week-old female mice. After tumor establishment phase, approximately 7-10 days post implantation (tumors 100-150mm 3 ), mice were randomized and assigned to groups: vehicle, PARPi, STING agonist (DMXAA) and combinational treatment. Animals were treated with 0.66 mg/kg Talazoparib (Selleck) or vehicle once a day administered through intraperitoneal injection. 8 mg/kg dose of DMXAA (Selleck) was administered every other day through intraperitoneal injection. Talazoparib, and vehicle containing 4% DMSO 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) and 60% saline was formulated daily. Tumors were monitored biweekly and animals were euthanized by the end of treatment or when the tumors reached an average of 2000 mm 3 . The tumor volume data of all the subcutaneous experiments were obtained by caliper measured and it was calculated using the following equation: volume = 0.5 × (L × W x H), where L = length, W = width, and H = height. All mice that reached the endpoint of the experiment were euthanized and tumors excised, weighed and protein extracts prepared for immunoblotting. For the orthotopic experiments, 5x10 4 luciferase-positive cells were implanted intratracheally into 8- to 12-week-old female mice (15/group). Five days post-implantation mice were randomized and assigned to treatments groups (see above). To calculate the initial tumor size, mice were monitored using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) 5 or 8 days post-implantation as described in the Figure legends. Tumors were then monitored twice a week using IVIS, and animals were euthanized either at the end of treatment (i.e., 15 days of treatment; final measurement) or when animals displayed severe signs of distress. For each IVIS measurement, we used 60” acquisition time. Next, a region of interest (ROI) was manually selected over relevant regions to quantify luminescence signal intensity. The area of the ROI was kept constant within experiments and the intensity was recorded as total photon counts per second per cm 2 within a ROI. Data were expressed as % tumor growth, calculated using the following equation: % tumor growth = [(Final measurement - Initial measurement)/Initial measurement] x 100. Mice that died before the last IVIS measurement were not included in the calculation of the % tumor growth. PDXs were revived and passaged once in NSG mice, and a live 2 × 2 mm piece of tumor was surgically transplanted subcutaneously into recipient NSG mice under anesthesia. After 4-6 weeks of engraftment, mice harboring measurable tumors (50–100 mm 3 ) were randomized to receive either vehicle or PARPi. Details on the generation of PDXs have been previously described (Gardner et al., 2017). CTG-1194: KRAS G12A ; ATM E2164K ; CTG-743: KRAS G12S ; TP53 S215R ; KEAP1 H311R .
Following siRNA (GE Healthcare) was used: ON-TARGETplus smart pool siRNA oligos targeting KEAP1 . The siRNA oligos were transfected into different cell lines using RNAi Max (Invitrogen). Following shRNA (GE Healthcare) was used: SMARTvector Lentiviral shRNA targeting mouse Emsy . Specific details about both siRNA and shRNA oligos used are provided in the key resources table .
I-SceI-based reporter assays were used to measure the efficiency of repair by HR, as described ( Gunn and Stark, 2012; Pierce et al., 1999 20. Gunn, A. ∙ Stark, J.M. I-SceI-based assays to examine distinct repair outcomes of mammalian chromosomal double strand breaks Methods Mol Biol. 2012; 920 :379-391 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Pierce, A.J. ∙ Johnson, R.D. ∙ Thompson, L.H. ... XRCC3 promotes homology-directed repair of DNA damage in mammalian cells Genes Dev. 1999; 13 :2633-2638 Crossref Scopus (1125) PubMed Google Scholar ). DR-GFP-U2OS cells obtained from Maria Jasin and Jeremy Stark labs. Cells were plated and, after 24 hours, treated with indicated siRNA oligos using RNAi Max (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer specifications; cell culture media was changed after overnight incubation. Three hours later, cells were transfected with the I-SceI-GR-RFP plasmid (a gift from Tom Misteli, Addgene plasmid # 17654); cell culture media was changed after 5 hours. Three hours later, a second siRNA knockdown was applied to cells and left overnight. Cell culture media was again changed and 0.2 mM triamcinolone acetonide (TCA, Sigma-Aldrich) was applied. After 24 hours, flow cytometry analysis was performed using a BD LSR II HTS Analyzer, and samples were quantified for the percentage of RFP positive cells that were also GFP positive.
Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Tumors were collected, fixed overnight, transferred to 70% ethanol, and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at a thickness of 3 μm and stained with H&E for pathological examination. Chromogenic IHC was performed on a Ventana Medical Systems DISCOVERY XT instrument with online deparaffinization using Ventana’s reagents and detection kits and antigen retrieved in Ventana Cell Conditioner 1 or 2. The following antibodies were used for IHC: anti-Ki67 (Clone D3B5, CST 9129S), anti-pH2AX (S139) (Clone 20E3, CST 9718S). HRP detection was used and antigen retrieval was performed in a Ventana Cell Conditioner 1 (TBE). Clinical lung cancer samples from NYU biospecimen core that were KEAP1 mutant or KEAP1 wild-type were probed with antibodies against EMSY (Atlas Antibodies, HPA050777). Analysis and scoring of mouse samples was performed by automated image analysis software ImmunoRatio (version 1.0c) (Institute of Biomedical Technology, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland). Analysis and scoring of human samples was performed by visually determining the intensity of nuclear immunoreactivity for EMSY. Pictures were obtained using an Olympus BX51 fitted with DP27 camera.
Cells were permeabilized with cold CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) prior to blocking. Cells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS before incubation with indicated primary antibodies. Alexa-555 or Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technology Corporation) were added for 1 hour at 1:2000 dilution. Slides were mounted in ProLong TM Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen). Imaging was performed using a DeltaVision Elite inverted microscope system (Applied Precision), using a x100/1.4NA Oil PSF Objective from Olympus. The system was equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera and SoftWorx imaging software version 5.0. Serial optical sections obtained 0.2-μm apart along the z axis were processed using the SoftWorx deconvolution algorithm and projected into one picture using SoftWorx software (Applied Precision).
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using polyethylenimine. Where indicated, 48 hours after transfection, HEK293T cells were incubated with MG132 for 4 hours before collection. Cell lysis was carried out with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, and 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose. Elution of the immunoprecipitated for anti-FLAG agarose resin was carried out with FLAG peptide. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described ( Marzio et al., 2019 38. Marzio, A. ∙ Puccini, J. ∙ Kwon, Y. ... The F-Box Domain-Dependent Activity of EMI1 Regulates PARPi Sensitivity in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers Mol Cell. 2019; 73 :224-237.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, samples were resolved under denaturing and reducing conditions using 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels (NuPAGE®) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After washing the membranes, secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase were applied (Amersham-GE). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and signal was acquired using ImageQuant LAS 400 (GE).
HEK293T were transiently co-transfected with lentiviral (pLVX or pTRIPZ) vectors containing vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) and the gene of interest along with pCMV-Delta R8.2 using Lipofectamine 3000. Lentivirus-containing medium, 48 hours after transfection, was collected and supplemented with 8 mg /mL Polybrene (Sigma). KP or KPK cells were infected by replacing the cell culture medium with the viral supernatant for 6 hours. Selection of stable clones was carried out using puromycin.
Preparation of Affinity Purification Samples for Mass Spectrometry. Samples and empty vector control were resuspended in NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (Novex). The samples were reduced with 2 μL of 0.2M dithiothreitol (Sigma) for one hour at 57°C at pH 8.0 and subsequently alkylated with 2 μL of 0.5M iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The samples were loaded immediately onto a NuPAGE® 4%–12% Bis-Tris Gel 1.0 mm (Life Technologies) and run at 200V. The gel was stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Thermo). The gel plugs were excised and de-stained in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of methanol and 100mM ammonium bicarbonate. The gel plugs were incubated with 250ng of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 100mM ammonium bicarbonate. The gel plugs were digested overnight with gentle agitation. The digestion was halted by adding a slurry of R2 50 μm Poros beads (Applied Biosystems) in 5% formic acid and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to each sample ( Cristea et al., 2005 11. Cristea, I.M. ∙ Williams, R. ∙ Chait, B.T. ... Fluorescent proteins as proteomic probes Mol Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4 :1933-1941 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). The samples were allowed to shake at 4°C for 2 hours. The beads were loaded onto C18 ziptips (Millipore), equilibrated with 0.1% TFA. The beads were washed with 0.5% acetic acid. Peptides were eluted with 40% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid followed by 80% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid. The organic solvent was removed using a SpeedVac concentrator and the sample reconstituted in 0.5% acetic acid.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis Affinity Purification. An aliquot of each sample was loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap trap column (75 μm ID x 2cm, 3 μm bead size, 100Å pore size) in line with an EASY-Spray PepMap analytical column (75 μm ID x 50cm C18, 2 μm bead size, 100Å pore size) using the auto sampler of an EASY-nLC 1000 HPLC (ThermoFisher) and solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid). The peptides were eluted into a ThermoFisher Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Mass Spectrometer increasing from 5% to 35% solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid) over 60 minutes, followed by an increase from 35% to 45% solvent B over 15 minutes followed by an increase of 45 to 100% solvent B in 10 minutes.
High resolution full MS spectra were obtained with a resolution of 120,000, an AGC target of 4e 5 , with a maximum ion time of 50ms, and a scan range from 400 to 1500 m/z. Following each full MS scan, low resolution MS/MS spectra were acquired for a 3 s duty cycle. The MS/MS spectra were collected in the ion trap in rapid scan mode, with an AGC target of 1e 5 , maximum ion time of 30ms, one microscan, 2 m/z isolation window, Normalized Collision Energy (NCE) of 32 and a dynamic exclusion of 30 ms.
Data Analysis. All acquired MS2 spectra were searched against a UniProt human database using Sequest within Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific). The search parameters were as follows: precursor mass tolerance ± 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance ± 0.4 Da, digestion parameters allowing trypsin 2 missed cleavages, fixed modification of carbamidomethyl on cysteine, variable modification of oxidation on methionine, and variable modification of deamidation on glutamine and asparagine. Peptides were filtered to better than 1% FDR using a target-decoy database strategy and proteins require at least two unique peptides to be reported.
Sample preparation for multiplexed quantitation, 500 μg of each protein lysates (obtained using a buffer: 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 8 M urea) were reduced using dithiothreitol (5 μL of 0.2 M) for 1 hours at 55°C. The reduced cysteines were subsequently alkylated with iodoacetamide (5 μL of 0.5 M) for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The samples were digested with LysC at a 200:1 (protein:enzyme) ratio for 2 hours at 37°C. Next, 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) was added to dilute the urea concentration to 2 M and the protein lysates were digested with trypsin (Promega) at a 100:1 (protein:enzyme) ratio overnight at room temperature. The digested protein lysates was acidified to pH < 3 using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and desalted using C18 solid-phase extraction (Sep-Pak, Waters). The desalted peptides were eluted using first 40% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.5% acetic acid followed by 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.5% acetic acid. The peptide eluate was concentrated using the SpeedVac and stored at −80°C.
Mice were sacrificed and lungs were perfused using sterile PBS through heart perfusion. Whole lungs were harvested and minced with scissors to sub-millimeter pieces in cold 2% FACS (PBS with 2% FBS) with Collagenase D (1 mg/mL; Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ), and DNase I (2 U/mL; Promega, Madison, WI), as previously described ( Deng et al., 2018 16. Deng, J. ∙ Wang, E.S. ∙ Jenkins, R.W. ... CDK4/6 Inhibition Augments Antitumor Immunity by Enhancing T-cell Activation Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :216-233 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tissues were then incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes with gentle shaking every 5 minutes. Specimens were passed through a 70 μm mesh and centrifuged at 350 g for 5 minutes and subsequently underwent red blood cell lysis with 1x RBC Solution (Biolegend) for 90 s, quenched with PBS and centrifuged again at 350 g for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were re-suspended and cell labeling was performed after blocking FcγRIII/II with an anti-CD16/CD32 mAb (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) by incubating 1x10 6 cells with 1 μg of fluorescently conjugated mAbs directed against mouse CD44 (IM7), CD206 (C068C2), PD-1 (29F.1A12), CD3 (17A2), CD4 (RM4-5), CD8 (53-6.7), CD45 (30-F11), CD11b (M1/70), Cd11c (N4118), Gr1 (RB6-8C5), MHC II (M5/114.15.2), NK1.1 (PK136), IL-10 (JES5-16E3), IFNγ (XMG1.2), TNFα (MP6-XT22), F4/80 (BM8), ICOS (15F9), CD62L (MEL-14), Ki67 (16A8), T-bet (4B10), Granzyme B (QA16A02), (all BioLegend, San Diego, CA), FoxP3 (FJK-16 s; eBiosciences), pTBK1 (637Ig11.2) (BD, Biosciences), and pIRF3 (D6O1M) (Cell Signaling). Dead cells were excluded from analysis using zombie yellow (BioLegend). When appropriate, cells were stained with cell surface markers as indicated, underwent cell fixation and permeabilization using 1x dilution of eBioscience flow cytometry kit, and subsequent staining for intracellular markers. Flow cytometry was performed on the Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) using the gating strategy shown in Figure S7 G. Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR).
EMSY, KEAP1, and NRF2 complementary cDNAs (both human and mouse) were inserted into a variety of vectors (modified pcDNA3.1 vectors containing N-terminal FLAG, Strep, and HA tags; pLVX-puro lentiviral vectors containing N-terminal FLAG and STREP tags or HA tag;) by sub-cloning or site-directed mutagenesis (KAPA Biosystems). Specific details will be provided on request.
The cell concentration, singularity, and viability of single cell suspensions of live leukocytes isolated by FACS-SORT for Cd45+ PI Negative cells from KP and KPK lung tumors ± STINGa treatment were confirmed before submission for scRNA-Seq (10x Genomics). scRNA-Seq was performed by the Genome Technology Center (GTC) and data processing and analysis was performed by the Applied Bioinformatics Laboratory (ABL). Sequencing results were demultiplexed and converted to FASTQ format using Illumina bcl2fastq software. The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite ( https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger ) was used to perform sample demultiplexing and single-cell 3′ gene counting. The cDNA insert was aligned to the mm10/GRCm38 reference genome. Only confidently mapped non-PCR duplicates with valid UMIs were used to generate the gene-barcode matrix. Further analysis including the identification of highly variable genes, dimensionality reduction, standard unsupervised clustering algorithms, and the discovery of differentially expressed genes was performed using the The iCellR R package (v1.5.5) ( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iCellR ). To exclude low quality cells and cells that were extreme outliers in terms of library complexity, we calculated the distribution of genes detected per cell, UMIs, and the proportion of mitochondrial genes. Cells with more than 10% of the transcripts coming from mitochondrial genes or low number of covered genes (gene-count < 200) were removed, and the matrix was normalized based on library sizes accordingly. Demultiplexing the samples based on hashtag oligos (HTOs) was based on the read coverage of each hashtag per cell. A hashtag would be assigned to a cell if it had the highest coverage compared to the coverage of all the other hashtags. If two hashtags were of about equal coverage, the cell id would be considered a doublet (two cells coming from two different samples). For detecting doublet cells of the same sample/hashtag we used the pythong package “Scrublet” (v. 0.2.3) ( Wolock et al., 2019 53. Wolock, S.L. ∙ Lopez, R. ∙ Klein, A.M. Scrublet: Computational Identification of Cell Doublets in Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data Cell Syst. 2019; 8 :281-291.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (931) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final dataset included 7,586 total cells (ht1,ht2,ht4,ht5(438,3214,3639,295)) with a median of 1,800 detected genes. For dimensionality reduction, T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and K-nearest-neighbor-based Network graph drawing Layout (KNetL) were then performed (zoom = 300) ( Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991 18. Fruchterman, T.M.J. ∙ Reingold, E.M. Graph drawing by force-directed placement Software Pract Exper. 1991; 21 :1129-1164 Crossref Scopus (4415) Google Scholar ). PhenoGraph ( Levine et al., 2015 32. Levine, J.H. ∙ Simonds, E.F. ∙ Bendall, S.C. ... Data-Driven Phenotypic Dissection of AML Reveals Progenitor-like Cells that Correlate with Prognosis Cell. 2015; 162 :184-197 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1315) PubMed Google Scholar ) clustering was then performed and the clusters were displayed on both the t-SNE and KNetL map results. Then the marker genes were found for each cluster and visualized on heatmaps and scatterplots. Marker genes were then used to assign cell types based on Immgen expression patterns (Please see Figure S7 B and Table S1 ). Imputation was used for some data visualizations only and not for the analysis. For imputation we used KNN to average the expression of 10 neighboring cells per cell, using iCellR’s “run.impute” function on tSNE and KNetL data. We observed the presence of Cd8+/Cd4+ cells in both clusters 20 and 21, possibly due to a potential thymic contamination during samples collection. The presence of these cells does not affect the overall interpretation of the results.
The TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) mutation, transcriptomic and clinical data were directly downloaded using the TCGAbiolinks package (v2.12.6) in R. We subdivided these data with different groups based on their mutation genes or smoking history information. To calculate the tumor mutation burden per megabase, we used the total number of mutations (somatic, coding, base substitution and indel mutations) counted divided by the size of the region of the targeted territory.
For RNA-seq analysis on the KPK and KP mouse samples shown in Figure 1 , we used the raw read count tables from our previous paper (GSE122836). Normalization and differential expression analysis were performed with DEseq2 (v1.28.1) standard parameters (lfcshrink with apeglm estimation). To measure the association between biological pathways and the gene expression profiles of our KPK and KP samples, we used the gene set enrichment analysis (version 4.1) through the java GSEA Desktop Application with the GSEA-Preranked Tools using a ranked differential expressed genes (DEGs) list. The list was generated using the DEGs from the highest to lowest by a metric score calculated by using the inverse of the logarithm base 10 p value multiplied by the sign of the fold change. For the enrichment results, we performed 1000 permutations using the curated set 2 KEGG and REACTOME pathway lists (c2.cp.kegg.v7.2.symbols.gmt., c2.cp.reactome.v7.2.symbols.gmt.). Besides GSEA analysis on our own samples, we also performed GSEA analysis on the TCGA NSCLC (LUAD and LUSC) FPKM-normalized transcriptomic data matrix and separated the samples based on their mutation profiles with KEAP1 mutant or not. For the enrichment results, we performed 1000 permutations using the curated set Hallmark (h.all.v7.2.symbols.gmt).
For RNA-seq analysis on the KPK and KP mouse samples shown in Figures 5 and S5 , RNaseq differential expression analysis was performed for two lanes of an SP100 paired-end 50 Illumina NovaSeq 6000 run. Per-read per-sample FASTQ files were generated using the bcl2fastq2 Conversion software (v2.20) to convert per-cycle BCL base call files outputted by the sequencing instrument (RTA v3.4.4) into the FASTQ format. The alignment program, STAR (v2.7.3a), was used for mapping reads of 24 samples to the mouse reference genome mm10 and the application Fastq Screen (v.0.13.0) was utilized to check for contaminants. The software, featureCounts (Subread package v1.6.3), was used to generate matrices of read counts for annotated genomic features. For differential gene statistical comparisons between groups of replicate samples contrasted by KPKshCTRL, KPKsh Emsy , KPshCTRL, and KPsh Emsy conditions, the DESeq2 package (R v3.6.1) in the R statistical programming environment was utilized.
For intracellular cGAMP measurement, standard solutions of 2′, 3′-cGAMP were prepared, in a concentration range of 0.00005 to 5 nmol/mL, in an internal standard solution of 13C5-GMP. Each cell pellet sample was added with 100 μL of water. Cells were lysed on a MM 400 mill mixer with the aid of two metal balls at 30 Hz for 1 min, twice. 150 μL of acetonitrile was then added to each tube and the samples were homogenized again for 1 min twice, followed by sonication for 1 min in an ice-water bath. The samples were placed at −20°C for 30 min before centrifugal clarification at 21,000 g and 5°C for 5 min. The clear supernatants were collected. The protein pellets were used for protein assay using the standard Bradford procedure. 20 μL of the clear supernatant of each cell sample was mixed with 180 μL of the internal standard solution. 10 μL aliquots of resultant sample solutions and standard solutions were injected into a C18 LC column (2.1 ∗ 100 mm, 1.9 μm) to run UPLC-MRM/MS on a Waters Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Sciex QTRAP 6500 Plus mass spectrometer operated in the negative-ion ESI mode. The mobile phase was a 5-mM ammonium acetate buffer (A) and methanol (B) for binary gradient elution (0% to 15% B in 12 min), at 0.20 mL/min and 40°C. Concentrations of cGAMP were calculated with internal-standard calibration by interpolating the constructed linear-regression curve with the analyte-to-internal standard peak area ratios measured from the sample solutions.
Cells (2500 cells/well) for each condition were plated in 96 well plates and treated with different PARPis. After 96 hours cells viability was measured using alamarBlue TM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer specifications. In Figure 2 C, KP cells were plated and pre-treated with KI696 (1 mM) for one week.
For whole exome sequencing samples, the sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38/mm10) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner with the BWA-MEM algorithm. Low confidence mappings and duplicate reads were removed using Sambamba. Local indel realignment and base-quality score recalibration was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).
For RNA-seq samples, we used the publicly available raw sequencing files (GSE122836) from our previous paper. The sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38/mm10) using the STAR aligner (v2.5.0c) and duplicate reads were removed using Sambamba. Reads were split into exon segments and hard-clip any sequences within the intronic regions using GATK, followed by local indel realignment and base-quality score recalibration.
Single-nucleotide and small indel somatic variants were called with Strelka. Variants with at least 5 supporting reads and VAF > 5% were remained. ANNOVAR was used to annotate variants with genomic context.
All data were analyzed by Prism 9 (GraphPad). Unless otherwise noted in Fig. legends, data are representative of at least three biologically independent experiments. Two-group datasets were analyzed by Student’s unpaired t test. Linear regression analysis was performed with the GraphPad Prism 7 software χ2 test.
