Title: Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis


Abstract: Summary

Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA requires sequential reactions facilitated by the replication and transcription complex (RTC). Here, we present a structural snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 RTC as it transitions toward cap structure synthesis. We determine the atomic cryo-EM structure of an extended RTC assembled by nsp7-nsp8 2 -nsp12-nsp13 2 -RNA and a single RNA-binding protein, nsp9. Nsp9 binds tightly to nsp12 (RdRp) NiRAN, allowing nsp9 N terminus inserting into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, which then inhibits activity. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of cap core structure (GpppA). The orientation of nsp13 that anchors the 5′ extension of template RNA shows a remarkable conformational shift, resulting in zinc finger 3 of its ZBD inserting into a minor groove of paired template-primer RNA. These results reason an intermediate state of RTC toward mRNA synthesis, pave a way to understand the RTC architecture, and provide a target for antiviral development.

Section: Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 27 million infections and over 872,000 deaths ( Chan et al., 2020 5.

Therefore, new insights into the proteins that are essential to its life cycle and replication are needed to help inform the discovery of new COVID-19 therapeutics.
SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome ( Ziebuhr, 2005 46. Ziebuhr, J. The coronavirus replicase Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 287 :57-94 PubMed Google Scholar ). The replicase gene open reading frames 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b are translated into large polyproteins, which are proteolytically processed by two viral proteases to yield 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsps) ( Ziebuhr, 2005 46. Ziebuhr, J. The coronavirus replicase Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 287 :57-94 PubMed Google Scholar ). For efficient proliferation, a set of nsps assemble a replication and transcription complex (RTC) to synthesize the negative-strand template, the positive-strand genomic RNA, and subgenomic mRNAs.
The cap structure at the 5′ end of viral mRNAs plays essential roles in the life cycle of a virus by promoting initiation of translation, protecting mRNAs, and helping the virus escape host immune recognition ( Daffis et al., 2010 10. Daffis, S. ∙ Szretter, K.J. ∙ Schriewer, J. ... 2′-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap evades host restriction by IFIT family members Nature. 2010; 468 :452-456 Crossref Scopus (687) PubMed Google Scholar ). The formation of cap structure in CoVs involves four sequential enzymatic reactions: (1) a 5′ RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) in nsp13 removes the γ-phosphate of 5′-triphosphate end (pppA) of the nascent mRNA to generate 5′-diphosphate end (ppA) ( Ivanov et al., 2004 17.

Virol. 2004; 78 :7833-7838 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ), (2) an unknown guanylyltransferase (GTase) transfers a GMP to the remaining 5′-diphosphate end to yield the cap core structure (GpppA), (3) an N7-MTase in nsp14 methylates the cap guanine at the N7-position, thus producing the cap(0) structure ( 7Me GpppA) ( Chen et al., 2009 6. Chen, Y. ∙ Cai, H. ∙ Pan, J. ... Functional screen reveals SARS coronavirus nonstructural protein nsp14 as a novel cap N7 methyltransferase Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :3484-3489 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ), and (4) a 2′-O-MTase in nsp16 converts cap(0) into cap(1) ( 7Me GpppA 2’OMe ) by methylating the ribose 2′-O-position of the first transcribed nucleotide ( Bouvet et al., 2010 3.

For ease of description, ppA is referred to here as cap(−2), GpppA as cap(−1), analogous to the widely used 7Me GpppA as cap(0), and 7Me GpppA 2’OMe as cap(1). Previous studies have shown that nsp13, nsp14, and nsp16 carryout the first, third, and fourth steps of cap synthesis ( Bouvet et al., 2010 3. Bouvet, M. ∙ Debarnot, C. ∙ Imbert, I. ...

However, knowledge of the enzyme that catalyzes the second step, as well as its architecture and mechanism of RTC during cap formation and mRNA synthesis, has remained unclear.
Previously, the structures of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) in complex with polymerase cofactors nsp7 and nsp8–nsp12 and template-primer RNA (nsp7-nsp8 2 -nsp12-RNA; we name it the central RTC or C-RTC) ( Gao et al., 2020 14.

We aim to provide an insight into the architecture of the complete RTC, as well as its variations, and working mechanism during replication and transcription. CoV-encoded nsp9 is a single-chain nucleic acid-binding protein and has been shown to co-localize with viral nsps and is therefore likely to be a key constituent of RTC ( Bost et al., 2000 2.

Being indicated by the atomic structure of an extended E-RTC composed by E-RTC and nsp9 determined here, we provide evidence that the nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain of nsp12 is responsible for the second step of cap structure synthesis through its GTase activity and reveal a mechanism for how nsp9 inhibits nsp12 NiRAN GTase activity in an intermediate state of RTC for further cap(0) structure synthesis.

Section: Results

We expressed and purified the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 (residues N1–Q113) in E. coli and incubated with E-RTC (nsp7-nsp8 2 -nsp12-nsp13 2 -RNA) to form an extended E-RTC in the presence of guanosine diphosphate (GDP)⋅BeF 3 − ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Native gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) reveal the formation of a complex with upper shift compared to C-RTC and E-RTC ( Figure 1 C). After collecting and processing 8,597 cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) micrograph movies, the class that represented the extended E-RTC were identified and reconstructed to the overall resolution of 2.83 Å (with 67,540 particles). The local resolution for the density of the nsp7-nsp8 2 -nsp9-nsp12 part is ranging from 2.0 Å to 3.0 Å, except the density for the central β sheet of nsp9 is with the local resolution around 4.0 Å. The local resolution for the densities for two nsp13 molecules varies from 3.0 Å to 7.0 Å, and the poor-quality regions are mainly distributed beyond residue E145, possibly due to lack of intermolecular interaction. Nevertheless, the good quality of the density for the N-terminal part of nsp13, particularly in the interaction regions with other components in the extended E-RTC, allows us to rigid-body fit two nsp13 molecules into the density ( Figure S1 ; Table S1 ).
The extended E-RTC is composed of one nsp7, two nsp8 (identified as nsp8-1 and nsp8-2; Gao et al., 2020 14. Gao, Y. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from COVID-19 virus Science. 2020; 368 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (1126) PubMed Google Scholar ), one nsp12, two nsp13 (identified as nsp13-1 and nsp13-2 as indicated in Figure 2 ), a paired template-primer RNA, and an nsp9 ( Figure 2 ). The cryo-EM density with good quality clearly indicates the existence of nsp9 bound close to the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN. The template-primer RNA, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 assemble C-RTC with a similar architecture as previously reported ( Gao et al., 2020 14. Gao, Y. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from COVID-19 virus Science. 2020; 368 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (1126) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hillen et al., 2020 15. Hillen, H.S. ∙ Kokic, G. ∙ Farnung, L. ... Structure of replicating SARS-CoV-2 polymerase Nature. 2020; 584 :154-156 Crossref Scopus (550) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020b 40.

The paired portion of the template-primer RNA is tightly clamped by nsp12 and the helical stalks of the two nsp8 protomers. Two nsp13 protomers bind to the plane region formed by the two nsp8 protomers and nsp12. Nsp13-1 binds to nsp12 and nsp8-1 to stabilize the architecture of RTC, while nsp13-2 channels the unpaired 5′ extension of the RNA template through an RNA-binding channel formed by its 1A, 2A, and 1B domains. By comparison to E-RTC, the orientation of nsp13-2 has a distinct shift (will be discussed later).
In the extended E-RTC, nsp9 tightly binds with nsp12 adjacent to the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN ( Figure 3 A; Table S2 ). The nsp9-nsp12 buried interface is 928 Å 2 compared to ∼3,000 Å 2 for the total surface area of nsp9. Though the overall folding of nsp9 in the extended E-RTC and in the crystallographic structure (PDB: 6W9Q ) ( Littler et al., 2020 24. Littler, D.R. ∙ Gully, B.S. ∙ Colson, R.N. ... Crystal Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural Protein 9, Nsp9 iScience. 2020; 23 :101258 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ) are generally similar, nsp9 N1- nsp9 L9 move by ∼16 Å, allowing it to make contact with nsp12 NiRAN, the Interface and the Palm domains ( Figure S2 ).
The nsp9-nsp12 interface has two defined regions. Region 1 is formed by nsp9 N terminus, Palm domain, and a previously identified β-hairpin motif ( Gao et al., 2020 14. Gao, Y. ∙ Yan, L. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from COVID-19 virus Science. 2020; 368 :779-782 Crossref Scopus (1126) PubMed Google Scholar ) in NiRAN of nsp12 ( Figure 3 A). In region 1, the side chains of nsp12 D36 (β-hairpin), nsp12 Y728 (Palm), and nsp12 R733 (Palm) form hydrogen bonds with nsp9 N2 ( Figure 3 B). The backbone amide and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of nsp9 E3 interact with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of nsp12 Y38 (β-hairpin) and nsp12 R733 (Palm), respectively. In region 2, a flat region in nsp12 NiRAN interacts with the C-terminal α helix of nsp9, which is stabilized by several hydrophobic interactions and three hydrogen bonds ( Figure 3 C). In this region, nsp12 V202-V204-I223-V231 makes hydrophobic contacts with nsp9 L4 and nsp9 L103. The side chain of nsp9 N96 forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of nsp12 P232 and nsp12 Y289. Moreover, the backbone amide of nsp9 N96 contacts with nsp12 D291 (Interface). All these interacting residues are highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and RaTG13 ( Figure 3 D), suggesting a conserved nsp9-nsp12 interaction.
Interestingly, crystallographic structures of CoV-encoded nsp9 have shown that nsp9 is presumed to form a biological dimer utilizing the interaction between the C-terminal α helices ( Egloff et al., 2004 12. Egloff, M.P. ∙ Ferron, F. ∙ Campanacci, V. ... The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus replicative protein nsp9 is a single-stranded RNA-binding subunit unique in the RNA virus world Proc.

Two key conserved glycine residues (G100 and G104) in a GXXXG motif ( Kleiger et al., 2002 19. Kleiger, G. ∙ Grothe, R. ∙ Mallick, P. ...

Virol. 2009; 83 :3007-3018 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ) of the C-terminal α helix were shown to play an essential role in nsp9 dimerization, and the substitutions of them as glutamate residues significantly attenuated viral proliferation ( Miknis et al., 2009 26. Miknis, Z.J. ∙ Donaldson, E.F. ∙ Umland, T.C. ... Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nsp9 dimerization is essential for efficient viral growth J. Virol. 2009; 83 :3007-3018 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the extended E-RTC, G100 and G104 directly face nsp12 and participate in the formation of the nsp9-nsp12 interface ( Figure 3 C; Figure S2 ; Table S2 ), indicating nsp9 G100E and nsp9 G104E mutations have multiple roles in virus life cycle. Moreover, nsp9 N2 and nsp9 E3 are also included in both contacts with nsp12 in the extended E-RTC or with another nsp9 monomer in the dimeric crystal structure ( Figure S2 ). It is likely that nsp9 may have an intermediate from a homodimeric state (possibly appears immediately after translation) to a monomeric state to be further assembled into RTC.
To form the extended E-RTC, E-RTC was incubated with nsp9 in the presence of GDP⋅BeF 3 − . In the extended E-RTC, a GDP molecule is bound at the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN ( Figure 4 A; Figure S3 A). Its diphosphate moiety is buried in a positively charged pocket formed by the side chains of nsp12 K50, nsp12 N52, nsp12 K73, and nsp12 R116 in nsp12 NiRAN. A magnesium ion (Mg 2+ ) is coordinated by the diphosphate group of the bound GDP and the side chains of N209 and D218. The hydrophilic side chains of nsp12 D218 and nsp12 R116 form close contacts with the β-phosphate of the bound GDP. The side chain amide atom of nsp12 K73, which corresponds to K94 in EAV nsp9 and was suggested to be the conserved catalytic residue for nidoviral NiRAN ( Lehmann et al., 2015 22. Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Gulyaeva, A. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J.C. ... Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :8416-8434 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ), is 3.9 Å to the phosphoester oxygen between the α- and β-phosphate of the bound GDP. The imidazole group of nsp12 H75 stacks with the base of GDP to stabilize the conformation.
The N terminus of nsp9 inserts deep into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN and makes bonds with the bound GDP ( Figure 4 A; Figure S3 A). The side chain of nsp9 N1 makes an interaction with α-phosphate of the bound GDP, and the connecting density suggests the formation of a bond. Again, the residues that contact with GDP are highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and RatG13 ( Figure 3 D). In contrast to GDP binding with nsp12 NiRAN, BeF 3 − is not observed in the density ( Figure 4 A; Figure S3 A), and furthermore, there is no space in the active site of nsp12 NiRAN to accommodate BeF 3 − . Previous structural studies suggest that when GDP⋅BeF 3 − is bound to the active site of an enzyme it mimics the pre-hydrolysis state, while the release of BeF 3 − mimics progress of hydrolysis ( Korhonen et al., 2014 20. Korhonen, H.J. ∙ Conway, L.P. ∙ Hodgson, D.R. Phosphate analogues in the dissection of mechanism Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2014; 21 :63-72 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lack of GDP⋅BeF 3 − in the extended E-RTC suggests it may be captured in an intermediate state during nsp12 NiRAN catalytic reaction.
Being indicated by nsp9-nsp12 interaction, we further explored the function of nsp12 and the impact of nsp9 on it. Previous studies have shown the nsp12 NiRAN domain has structural similarity with pseudokinase selenoprotein-O (SelO) ( Figure S3 B), which has AMPylation activity whereby AMP is transferred from ATP to Ser/Thr/Tyr residues on protein substrates ( Sreelatha et al., 2018 34. Sreelatha, A. ∙ Yee, S.S. ∙ Lopez, V.A. ... Protein AMPylation by an Evolutionarily Conserved Pseudokinase Cell. 2018; 175 :809-821.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the N terminus of nsp9 inserts into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN and makes a bond with GDP, we first verified whether nsp9 is a possible substrate of nsp12 NiRAN. To do this, we incubated nsp9 with nsp12 in the presence of NTP and did not detect a peak corresponding to the NTP-modified N-terminal peptide of nsp9 in mass spectrum ( Figure 4 B). Since the residue of nsp9 that contacts with bound GDP is an asparagine residue, this result is not surprising.
Another study has shown that the NiRAN domain in nidoviral RdRp has nucleotidylation activity with uridine-5ʹ-triphosphate (UTP)/guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) preference ( Lehmann et al., 2015 22. Lehmann, K.C. ∙ Gulyaeva, A. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J.C. ... Discovery of an essential nucleotidylating activity associated with a newly delineated conserved domain in the RNA polymerase-containing protein of all nidoviruses Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :8416-8434 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next assessed whether SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 has nucleotidylation activity. Using a pyrophosphate assay, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 indeed has the nucleotidylation activity in the presence of GTP or UTP ( Figure 4 C). The mutation of the catalytic residue nsp12 K73A eliminated the nucleotidylation activity of nsp12 and this activity was attenuated in the presence of wild-type (WT) nsp9. Moreover, we made several mutants of residues that are involved in the nsp9-nsp12 interaction, including nsp9 truncated by five N-terminal residues, (nsp9Δ5), nsp9 N96A, nsp9 G100E, and nsp9 G104E, and found that all these mutations restore the nucleotidylation activity of nsp12. These results further suggest that the association of nsp9 inhibits the nucleotidylation activity of nsp12.
We then investigated whether the nucleotidylation activity of nsp12 may function as 5′ end cap GTase to transfer a GMP to ppA to produce GpppA for the further formation of cap(0) structure. In an in vitro GTase assay, we found that nsp12 catalyzes the transfer of GMP to ppA-RNA to form GpppA-RNA in the presence of nsp13, which is known to function as a CoV RTPase to yield ppA-RNA from pppA-RNA ( Ivanov et al., 2004 17. Ivanov, K.A. ∙ Thiel, V. ∙ Dobbe, J.C. ... Multiple enzymatic activities associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus helicase J. Virol. 2004; 78 :5619-5632 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004 16. Ivanov, K.A. ∙ Ziebuhr, J. Human coronavirus 229E nonstructural protein 13: characterization of duplex-unwinding, nucleoside triphosphatase, and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities J. Virol. 2004; 78 :7833-7838 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 D). In the presence of nsp9, the signal corresponding to the radioactive-labeled GpppA-RNA is attenuated more so than in the absence of nsp9; however, a certain extent of the signal still exists. Since the nucleotidylation activity of nsp12 still remains in the presence of nsp9 ( Figure 4 C), this result is not surprising. Alternatively, in the absence of nsp13, the amount of synthesis of GpppA-RNA is negligible. All these results support the concept that nsp12 NiRAN functions as a GTase to catalyze the formation of cap core structure (GpppA) and the association with nsp9 inhibits this process.
Previous studies show that two nsp13 protomers and their interactions play an essential role in template binding and RNA unwinding ( Chen et al., 2020a 8. Chen, J. ∙ Malone, B. ∙ Llewellyn, E. ... Structural Basis for Helicase-Polymerase Coupling in the SARS-CoV-2 Replication-Transcription Complex Cell. 2020; 182 :1560-1573.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2020 42. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nature Communications. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Comparison of the nsp13 protomers in E-RTC and the extended E-RTC shows that the conformation of nsp13-1 is conserved; however, the orientation of nsp13-2 has a notable difference ( Figures 5 A and 5B; Figure S4 ).
In the extended E-RTC, nsp13-2, as a rigid body, moves downward to the template-primer RNA clamped by nsp8-1 and nsp8-2. As a consequence, the zinc finger 3 (ZF3) motif of nsp13-2 ZBD (zinc-binding domain) and the adjacent loop (spanning residues G66–S80) insert into the groove that is formed by nsp8-1 and nsp8-2 to clamp the paired template-primer in the extended E-RTC. The insertion part of nsp13-2 ZBD is closed to the second minor groove (originated from the polymerase center of nsp12) of the paired template-primer RNA ( Figure 5 D; Figure S5 A; Table S3 ). But in E-RTC, ZF3 is distant from this groove ( Figure 5 C; Figure S5 A). Because ZF3 has been shown to play essential roles in nidovirus mRNA synthesis without impact on the helicase activity ( Seybert et al., 2005 33. Seybert, A. ∙ Posthuma, C.C. ∙ van Dinten, L.C. ... A complex zinc finger controls the enzymatic activities of nidovirus helicases J.

Virol. 2000; 74 :5213-5223 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ), the movement of nsp13-2 looks to be a necessary step that occurs in CoV mRNA synthesis.
Another interesting observation is that the movement of nsp13-2 ZBD toward nsp13-1 ZBD and nsp8-1 with a large distance of 35 Å results in a hydrogen-bond formed by the carbonyl oxygen atom of nsp13-2 P53 and nsp8-1 Y71 ( Figure S4 D; Table S4 ). In contrast, nsp8-1 Y71 interacts with nsp13-1 and has no contact with nsp13-2 in the E-RTC. The movement of nsp13-2 also results in a loosening of the contact between 1B domains of the two nsp13s ( Figures 5 E and 5F).

Section: Discussion

The formation of the cap structure is essential to synthesize CoV mRNA. Among the four sequential steps for CoV cap structure formation, the activities of RTPase, N7-MTase, and 2′-O-Mtase, which are deployed by nsp13, nsp14, and nsp16, respectively, facilitate the first, third, and fourth step and are well established ( Bouvet et al., 2010 3.

Virol. 2004; 78 :7833-7838 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this work, we show evidence that nsp12 NiRAN biochemically catalyzes the transfer of a GMP to ppA to form the GpppA cap core structure, supporting that nsp12 NiRAN is an enzyme that catalyzes the second step of cap structure synthesis. This finding provides complementary key information to understand the circle of CoV mRNA synthesis. We note here that nsp12 NiRAN can also catalyze the transfer of an uridine 5′-monophosphate (UMP) to ppA to form UpppA ( Figure S6 ). However, because the subsequent methyl transfer reaction for cap synthesis requires nsp14 that has N7-guanine MTase activity ( Bouvet et al., 2010 3. Bouvet, M. ∙ Debarnot, C. ∙ Imbert, I. ...

Interestingly, nsp9 tightly contacts with nsp12 NiRAN and inhibits its enzymatic activity in the extended E-RTC. CoV-encoded nsp9 has been known to have RNA- and DNA-binding ability and to co-localize with nsps in the virus life cycle, suggesting it is a key component of RTC ( Bost et al., 2000 2.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus replicative protein nsp9 is a single-stranded RNA-binding subunit unique in the RNA virus world Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :3792-3796 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sutton et al., 2004 35. Sutton, G. ∙ Fry, E. ∙ Carter, L. ... The nsp9 replicase protein of SARS-coronavirus, structure and functional insights Structure. 2004; 12 :341-353 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon nsp9 binding to nsp12 NiRAN, the residues in the N-terminal β-hairpin spanning residues V31-K50 of nsp12 NiRAN and the residues in the central β sheet of nsp9 form a positively charged groove, extending from the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN to nsp9 ( Figure S5 B). This groove may represent a potential RNA-binding groove to stabilize the conformation of the released 5′ end of GpppA-RNA after catalytic reaction, standing by for its subsequent processing by nsp14 and nsp16 to form the cap structure and the mature mRNAs. In this context, ZF3 of nsp13-2 ZBD might function as a “brake” to temporarily suspend the elongation of nascent RNA by inserting into the minor groove of the double-stranded nascent RNA-template pair.
According to current structural information of CoV RTCs, we propose a speculative model for SARS-CoV-2 RTC to catalyze the synthesis of mRNA ( Figure 6 ). In the initial step, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 compose the C-RTC. In the second step, C-RTC recruits two nsp13 molecules and template-primer RNA to form the E-RTC that catalyzes the elongation of nascent RNA with 5′ triphosphate (pppA-RNA) under the guidance of template RNA. In the third step, a nsp13 molecule may catalyze the remove of the 5′ γ-phosphate group of pppA-RNA to generate ppA-RNA. Because two nsp13 molecules observed in this work are remote from the 5′ end of the nascent RNA, it is likely that another nsp13 might be recruited in an unidentified position for this step. We name this RTC cap(−2)-RTC. In the fourth step, the 5′ diphosphate end of ppA-RNA would be delivered to nsp12 NiRAN to form GpppA-RNA in a so-called cap(−1)-RTC. When the enzymatic reaction of nsp12 NiRAN is finished, an nsp9 will be recruited to form a cap(−1)’-RTC as an intermediate state, in which nsp9 stabilize the 5′ end of GpppA-RNA in the potential RNA-binding groove. It is worthy to note that the observed 5′ end of the product is around 110 Å from nsp12 NiRAN catalytic center in cap(−1)’-RTC. It is likely that some other nsps would be assembled into cap(−1)-RTC and serve as structural building blocks to mediate the transferring of 5′ end of the nascent ssRNA to nsp12 NiRAN catalytic center. This might be a necessary prerequisite for the correct function of the complete RTC. In the fifth step, nsp14 would be recruited to form a cap(0)-RTC to catalyze the methylation of the cap guanine at the N7-position to yield 7Me GpppA-RNA. And in the last step, nsp16 would be recruited to form a cap(1)-RTC to catalyze the methylation of the ribose 2′-O-position of the first transcribed nucleotide to produce mature mRNA with 7Me GpppA 2’OMe cap(1) structure.
Several crystallographic structures of nsp9 present a dimeric form of nsp9, in which the dimerization was shown to be important for efficient virus proliferation ( Egloff et al., 2004 12. Egloff, M.P. ∙ Ferron, F. ∙ Campanacci, V. ... The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus replicative protein nsp9 is a single-stranded RNA-binding subunit unique in the RNA virus world Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :3792-3796 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Littler et al., 2020 24. Littler, D.R. ∙ Gully, B.S. ∙ Colson, R.N. ...

Miknis, Z.J. ∙ Donaldson, E.F. ∙ Umland, T.C. ... Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nsp9 dimerization is essential for efficient viral growth J. Virol. 2009; 83 :3007-3018 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sutton et al., 2004 35. Sutton, G. ∙ Fry, E. ∙ Carter, L. ... The nsp9 replicase protein of SARS-coronavirus, structure and functional insights Structure. 2004; 12 :341-353 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the interfaces for nsp9 dimerization and nsp9-nsp12 interaction are overlapped, it is likely that the homodimeric form of nsp9 exists after it is immediately translated and that an intermediate from dimer to monomer is necessary for the further assembly of nsp9 into cap(−1)′-RTC. Moreover, the orientation of nsp13 in cap(−1)′-RTC changes compared with its orientation in E-RTC, though there is no direct association between nsp9 and nsp13. The function underlying the structural rearrangement of helicase in the RTCs during RTC warrants further investigation.
Finally, nsp12 NiRAN plays an essential role in mRNA synthesis of SARS-CoV-2. Because the binding pocket of the N-terminal peptide of nsp9 in nsp12 NiRAN (region 1) is a deep groove, it is conceivable that a reagent that occupies this groove with higher binding affinity may inhibit mRNA synthesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this pocket, the hydrophilic residues would play a central role to stabilize the interaction of a potential inhibitor. Moreover, a compound that can bind to the GDP binding site in nsp12 NiRAN catalytic center, e.g., a nucleotide analog (possibly in a diphosphate form), would also be likely to function as an inhibitor. Thus, this complex is a potential new target for antiviral development against SARS-CoV-2.

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
The cryo-EM density map and the structure were deposited into the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) and Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession numbers 30504 and 7CYQ. Additional supplemental items are available from Mendeley Data at https://doi.org/10.17632/3t26cmw7k2.1 .
Proteins were obtained through recombinant expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3).
The gene for SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 possessing a 6 × His-tag N terminus was cloned into a modified pET-28b-SUMO vector. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells were then transformed by inclusion of this vector. The cells were grown to an optical density (OD 600 ) of 0.8 at 37°C, and protein expression was then induced by addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). The culture was allowed to grow overnight at 16°C. The cells were centrifugation at 4,500 rpm for 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4°C. After homogenization, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min to remove cell debris. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography and by application to a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in lysis buffer. Purified nsp9 was concentrated to 5 mg/mL and stored at 4°C.
Full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 were co-expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as a no-tagged protein and a 6 × His-SUMO fusion protein, respectively. After purification by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography, the nsp7-nsp8 complex was eluted through on-column tag cleavage by ULP protease. The complex was further purified by using a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) and a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2.
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 (GenBank: MN908947) gene was cloned into a modified pET-22b vector, with the C terminus possessing a 10 × His-tag. E. coli BL21 (DE3), were transformed by inclusion of these plasmids. The transformed cells were cultured at 37°C in LB media containing 100 mg/L ampicillin. After the OD 600 reached 0.8, the culture was cooled to 16°C and supplemented with 0.5 mM IPTG. After overnight induction, the cells were harvested through centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4°C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 50 min. The fusion protein was first purified by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography and then further purified by passage through a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 4 mM DTT) and buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1M NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 4 mM DTT). Then it was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) with buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl 4 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM GDP and 2 mM BeF 3 - ). Purified nsp12 was concentrated to 4.8 mg/mL and stored at 4°C.
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 (GenBank: MN908947) gene was inserted into the modified pET-28a vector with a 6 × His tag attached at its N terminus. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were then transformed by introduction of this plasmid. Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37°C until the OD 600 was 0.8. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.2 mM IPTG and grown at 16°C for 16-18 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer 3 (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol). The cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 40 min and then lysed by high-pressure homogenization and sonication. After purification by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography, the protein eluted with 200 mM imidazole. The eluate was then further purified by Hitrap S ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) before loading onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in the buffer 4 (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 4mM DTT). Purified nsp13 was concentrated to 4 mg/mL and stored at 4°C.
To assemble C-RTC, nsp12 was incubated with nsp7 and nsp8 at 4°C for three h with a molar ratio of 1: 2: 2 in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl 2 . Then the mixture was purified by mono Q 5/50 ion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, USA), resulting in a stable nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex. A 58-mer oligoribonucleotide as the template and a 32-mer oligoribonucleotide as the primer were chemically synthesized by TAKARA ( Figure 1 A). The template and primer oligoribonucleotides were annealed by heating the solution to 70°C and gradually cooling to 4°C. The annealed RNA scaffold was incubated with nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex for 30 min at 25°C to form C-RTC. The mixture was incubated with 8 mg/mL nsp13 and pretreated with 2 mM GDP⋅BeF 3 - and 5 mg/mL nsp9 for 30 min at 30°C to assemble the extended E-RTC.
The pyrophosphate assays were performed as previously reported( Kottur and Nair, 2018 21. Kottur, J. ∙ Nair, D.T. Pyrophosphate hydrolysis is an intrinsic and critical step of the DNA synthesis reaction Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :5875-5885 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yi et al., 2012 43. Yi, Y.J. ∙ Sutovsky, M. ∙ Kennedy, C. ... Identification of the inorganic pyrophosphate metabolizing, ATP substituting pathway in mammalian spermatozoa PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e34524 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) by using a Pyrophosphate Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Assays were performed at room temperature (25°C) in a black 96-well plate. 50 μl kit Assay Buffer was supplemented with 3 μM nsp12 or relevant mutants, 3 μM nsp9 or relevant mutants and was first loaded into the black 96-well. 50 μl kit Master Reaction Mix containing PP i sensor was supplemented with 1 mM GTP or UTP and was subsequently loaded to form a 100 μl reaction system. The emitted fluorescence (excitation 316 nm, emission 456 nm) was measured every 30 s (Thermo Fluoroskan, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) to yield the reaction curves. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The fitting function is the one-phase association in Graphpad Prism.
DNA fragments including the optimized T7 class II promoter Ф2.5 with ATP as initial nucleotide and 5′-ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′ were used as a template for in vitro transcription. We used the nsp12 and nsp13 and [α- 32 P]-GTP or [α- 32 P]-UTP to label the 5′ terminus of the RNA to G ∗ pppA-RNA. After reaction, the reaction systems were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant were spotted on polyethylenimine cellulose plates. To improve the efficiency of the reaction, 0.05 U inorganic pyrophosphatase (New England Biolabs, USA) was added in the reaction system. The marker G ∗ pppA-RNA was prepared with the Vaccinia capping system (except for SAM) (New England Biolabs, USA).
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the bands of interest were excised from the gel, reduced with 5 mM of dithiotreitol, and alkylated with 11 mM iodoacetamide. In-gel digestion was carried out with sequencing grade modified trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C overnight. The peptides were extracted twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile aqueous solution for 30 min. Extracts were then centrifuged in a SpeedVac to concentrate the sample. Tryptic peptides were redissolved in 20 μL 0.1% TFA and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
For LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptides were separated by a 85 min gradient elution at a flow rate 0.30 μL/min with a Thermo-Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system, which was directly interfaced with a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer. The analytical column was a home-made fused silica capillary column (75 μm ID, 150 mm length; Upchurch, Oak Harbor, WA) packed with C-18 resin (300 Å, 5 μm, Varian, Lexington, MA). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode using Xcalibur 2.1.2 software and there was a single full-scan mass spectrum in the orbitrap (300-1800 m/z, 70,000 resolution) followed by 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans at 27% normalized collision energy (HCD).
The MS/MS spectra from each LC-MS/MS run were searched against the SARS-CoV-2 nsp9.fasta using an in-house Proteome Discoverer (Version PD1.4, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA). The search criteria were as follows: full tryptic specificity was required; two missed cleavage was allowed; Carbamidomethyl (C) were set as the fixed modifications; the oxidation (M) was set as the variable modification; precursor ion mass tolerances were set at 20 ppm for all MS acquired in an orbitrap mass analyzer; and the fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 0.02Da for all MS2 spectra acquired. The peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using Percolator provided by PD. When the q value was smaller than 1%, the peptide spectrum match (PSM) was considered to be correct. FDR was determined based on PSMs when searched against the reverse, decoy database. Peptides only assigned to a given protein group were considered as unique. The false discovery rate (FDR) was also set to 0.01 for protein identifications.
In total, 3 μL of protein solution at 3 mg/mL (added with 0.025% DDM) was applied onto a H2/O2 glow-discharged, 200-mesh Quantifoil R0.6/1.0 grid (Quantifoil, Micro Tools GmbH, Germany). The grid was then blotted for 3.0 s with a blot force of 0 at 8°C and 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cryo-EM data were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan, USA). Images were recorded at 29000 × magnification and calibrated super-resolution pixel size 0.82 Å/pixel. The exposure time was set to 2 s with a total accumulated dose of 60 electrons per Å 2 . All images were automatically recorded using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 25. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3221) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 4107 images were collected with a defocus range from −2.0 μm to −1.0 μm. Statistics for data collection and refinement are in Table S1 .
All dose-fractioned images were motion-corrected and dose-weighted by MotionCorr2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 44. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ) software and their contrast transfer functions were estimated by ctffind4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 29. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2867) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 529,588 particles were auto-picked using blob picker and extracted with a box size of 448 pixels in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 28. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following 2D, 3D classifications and refinements were all performed in cryoSPARC. 188,021 particles were selected after two rounds of 2D classification based on the complex integrality. This particle set was used to do Ab-Initio reconstruction in six classes, which were then used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous refinement, with 67,540 particles converged into one nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 2 -nsp9-nsp13 2 -RNA complex class. Next, these particles were imported into RELION 3.03 ( Scheres, 2012 31. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform local classification to obtain one class particle with final resolution 2.83 Å.
To solve the structure of SARS-CoV-2 mini RTC complex, the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 and nsp7-8 complex (PDB: 7BTF ), SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 (PDB: 6ZSL ) and nsp9 (PDB: 6W9Q ) were individually placed and rigid-body fitted into the cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 27. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33470) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was manually built in Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 13. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20218) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the guidance of the cryo-EM map, and in combination with real space refinement using Phenix ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Klaholz, B.P. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... New tools for the analysis and validation of cryo-EM maps and atomic models Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :814-840 Crossref Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data validation statistics are shown in Table S1 .
In Figure 4 C, the activity of nsp12 NiRAN domain in pyrophosphate assays were calculated by using GraphPad Prism as mean ± SD from three independent experiments as indicated in the legend of Figure 4 C.
In Figure 4 D, the integrate densities of the bands in lane 4-7, which are corresponding to apo-nsp12, nsp12 plus nsp9, nsp12 plus 2 ∗ nsp9, and nsp12 plus 3 ∗ nsp9, were calculated by IamgeJ Fiji distribution ( Schindelin et al., 2012 32. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40001) PubMed Google Scholar ) as indicated in the legend of Figure 4 D.
In Figure S1 , resolution estimations of cryo-EM density maps are based on the 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion ( Chen et al., 2013 7. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ...
