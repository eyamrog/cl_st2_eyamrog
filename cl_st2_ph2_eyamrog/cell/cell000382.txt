Title: Splice site m 6 A methylation prevents binding of U2AF35 to inhibit RNA splicing


Abstract: Summary

The N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) RNA modification is used widely to alter the fate of mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that the C. elegans writer METT-10 (the ortholog of mouse METTL16) deposits an m 6 A mark on the 3′ splice site (AG) of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase pre-mRNA, which inhibits its proper splicing and protein production. The mechanism is triggered by a rich diet and acts as an m 6 A-mediated switch to stop SAM production and regulate its homeostasis. Although the mammalian SAM synthetase pre-mRNA is not regulated via this mechanism, we show that splicing inhibition by 3′ splice site m 6 A is conserved in mammals. The modification functions by physically preventing the essential splicing factor U2AF35 from recognizing the 3′ splice site. We propose that use of splice-site m 6 A is an ancient mechanism for splicing regulation.

Section: Introduction

It has been known since the early 1970s that RNAs can be modified with N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) ( Desrosiers et al., 1974 15. Desrosiers, R. ∙ Friderici, K. ∙ Rottman, F.

The complex installs the m 6 A mark within a loosely defined RR m 6 A CH motif at thousands of sites in the transcriptome, with a bias towards the 3′ end of the RNA, where it is enriched near the stop codon ( Dominissini et al., 2012 18.

Notably, this m 6 A writer-reader system is absent in nematodes.
The second mRNA m 6 A writer, METTL16, is highly conserved, with current knowledge of the enzyme coming from investigation of the protein in mammals. METTL16 ( Brown et al., 2016 12. Brown, J.A. ∙ Kinzig, C.G. ∙ DeGregorio, S.J. ... Methyltransferase-like protein 16 binds the 3′-terminal triple helix of MALAT1 long noncoding RNA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :14013-14018 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) has a very strict requirement for target methylation because it methylates an adenosine within a nonamer consensus motif (UAC m 6 A GAGAA) only when it is present in a structured RNA context ( Doxtader et al., 2018 20.

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase MAT2A mRNA and the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) are the two known targets of mammalian METTL16 ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61.

SAM synthetase is the enzyme responsible for production of the methyl donor SAM, which is required for methylation reactions in the cell. In the case of human MAT2A mRNA, there are six methylation sites in the 3′ UTR, each with the motif occupying the single-stranded region of a stem-loop structure ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61.

Methylation of these sites has been proposed to recruit the nuclear reader protein YTHDC1, which promotes decay of the MAT2A mRNA ( Shima et al., 2017 73. Shima, H. ∙ Matsumoto, M. ∙ Ishigami, Y. ... S-Adenosylmethionine Synthesis Is Regulated by Selective N 6 -Adenosine Methylation and mRNA Degradation Involving METTL16 and YTHDC1 Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3354-3363 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the central gene-regulatory role of METTL16 appears to be non-catalytic because it has been shown to bind the stem-loop structure to promote splicing of a frequently retained terminal intron ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61. Pendleton, K.E. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Liu, K. ... The U6 snRNA m 6 A Methyltransferase METTL16 Regulates SAM Synthetase Intron Retention Cell. 2017; 169 :824-835.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). Efficient splicing is critical to produce the MAT2A enzyme and maintain cellular SAM levels. Mammalian METTL16 has a highly conserved N-terminal RNA methyltransferase domain and a C-terminal region that is present only in vertebrates. Importantly, this non-catalytic C-terminal vertebrate-conserved region (VCR) of METTL16 is critical for splicing regulation of the human SAM synthetase MAT2A mRNA ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61. Pendleton, K.E. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Liu, K. ... The U6 snRNA m 6 A Methyltransferase METTL16 Regulates SAM Synthetase Intron Retention Cell. 2017; 169 :824-835.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting such a non-catalytic splicing stimulation role, loss of mouse Mettl16 leads to reduced levels of mature Mat2a mRNA, causing pre-implantation embryonic lethality ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the question of the relevance of METTL16’s catalytic activity, which is conserved from bacteria to humans. By investigating the invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of the enzyme, our study identifies 3ʹ splice-site m 6 A methylation as a conserved mechanism to regulate splicing.

Section: Results

To study the conserved role of the catalytic activity of METTL16, we chose the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (hereafter referred to as worm). The worm ortholog METT-10 ( Dorsett et al., 2009 19. Dorsett, M. ∙ Westlund, B. ∙ Schedl, T. METT-10, a putative methyltransferase, inhibits germ cell proliferative fate in Caenorhabditis elegans Genetics. 2009; 183 :233-247 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) contains the highly conserved RNA methyltransferase domain ( Figure S1 A) but lacks the VCRs found in mammalian METTL16 ( Figure 1 A). We began the study by detecting various ribose and base modifications in total and poly(A) + RNAs from adult worms ( Figure 1 B; STAR Methods ). RNA from adult mouse testes and an insect cell line ( Bombyx mori BmN4 cells) were used for comparison. The m 6 A modification is detected in poly(A) + RNA from all three biological sources, including C. elegans ( Figure 1 B), which is important for this study.
To identify worm transcripts that carry the m 6 A methylation, we carried out m 6 A-IP-seq ( Ke et al., 2015 37. Ke, S. ∙ Alemu, E.A. ∙ Mertens, C. ... A majority of m6A residues are in the last exons, allowing the potential for 3′ UTR regulation Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :2037-2053 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a mixture of poly(A) + RNAs from adult C. elegans and mouse testicular RNA ( Figure 1 C; Table S1 ; STAR Methods ). The mouse RNA serves as an internal technical control because m 6 A sites are already mapped in this system ( Wojtas et al., 2017 90. Wojtas, M.N. ∙ Pandey, R.R. ∙ Mendel, M. ... Regulation of m 6 A Transcripts by the 3′→5′ RNA Helicase YTHDC2 Is Essential for a Successful Meiotic Program in the Mammalian Germline Mol. Cell. 2017; 68 :374-387.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared with over 20,000 mouse peaks, we identified only 176 m 6 A peaks in the worm poly(A) + transcriptome ( Figures S1 B–S1D), which likely reflects the absence of the METTL3/METTL14 writer complex in worms ( Sendinc et al., 2020 71.

The profile and dynamics of RNA modifications in animals ChemBioChem. 2017; 18 :979-984 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, a motif analysis of the mouse peaks reveals the presence of the expected RRACH context (R = A and G; H = A, C, and U) used by the dominant mammalian METTL3/METTL14 writer ( Figure 1 D; Dominissini et al., 2012 18. Dominissini, D. ∙ Moshitch-Moshkovitz, S. ∙ Schwartz, S. ...

Ke, S. ∙ Alemu, E.A. ∙ Mertens, C. ...

Comprehensive analysis of mRNA methylation reveals enrichment in 3′ UTRs and near stop codons Cell. 2012; 149 :1635-1646 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1636) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this is absent in worms. Meta-analysis of m 6 A-IP reads mapping to all mouse transcripts produces the typical profile, characterized by high levels of methylation over the coding sequences with peaks at the 5′ end and over the stop codon ( Figure 1 E). In contrast, such a pattern of m 6 A distribution is clearly absent over worm sequences ( Figure 1 E), and a motif search did not recover any particular sequence context for the worm m 6 A-enriched reads ( Figure S1 E).
Having confirmed the presence of m 6 A on worm poly(A) + RNA, we wished to determine the contribution of METT-10 ( Dorsett et al., 2009 19. Dorsett, M. ∙ Westlund, B. ∙ Schedl, T. METT-10, a putative methyltransferase, inhibits germ cell proliferative fate in Caenorhabditis elegans Genetics. 2009; 183 :233-247 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). To search for its methylation targets, we used a comparative analysis of m 6 A-IP-seq datasets to identify poly(A) + transcripts that show reduced m 6 A methylation (m 6 A-IP reads/input reads) in the mett-10 knockout (KO) mutant ( Figure 1 F and S1 F; Table S2 ). Of these, the top 20 encode the U6 snRNA sequences ( Figures 1 G and S1 G). U6 snRNA is a non-polyadenylated transcript, so its presence in the poly(A) + dataset is likely due to remnants left after poly(A) + enrichment from total RNA. Consistent with this, a separate m 6 A-IP-seq experiment conducted with total RNA samples shows a higher enrichment of the U6 snRNA reads ( Figure 1 H). Human U6 snRNA is methylated within a nonamer motif (UAC m 6 A GAGAA) by human METTL16 ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61. Pendleton, K.E. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Liu, K. ...

Warda, A.S. ∙ Kretschmer, J. ∙ Hackert, P. ... Human METTL16 is a N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) methyltransferase that targets pre-mRNAs and various non-coding RNAs EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 :2004-2014 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ), and mapping of m 6 A-IP reads shows that the worm U6 snRNA is also methylated within an identical site ( Figures 1 I and S1 G). Importantly, this m 6 A signal is lost in the mett-10 KO ( Figures 1 H and 1I). As an independent validation, we used the SCARLET method, which allows examination of the methylation status in a nucleotide-specific manner ( Liu et al., 2013 45. Liu, N. ∙ Parisien, M. ∙ Dai, Q. ... Probing N6-methyladenosine RNA modification status at single nucleotide resolution in mRNA and long noncoding RNA RNA. 2013; 19 :1848-1856 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of total RNA from adult worms confirms methylation of this specific adenosine within the methylation consensus motif, and this is completely lost in the mett-10 KO ( Figures 1 J and S1 H). Loss of methylation in the mett-10 KO has a slightly positive influence on the overall U6 snRNA levels ( Figures S1 I and S1J).
Other transcripts that display a significant drop in m 6 A levels in the mett-10 KO are sams-3 , sams-4 , and sams-5 ( Figure 1 G). These duplicated genes encode the SAM synthetase, the enzyme responsible for production of the methyl donor SAM, which is required for methylation reactions in the cell. We identify worm METT-10 as an m 6 A RNA methyltransferase, and, like its mammalian ortholog METTL16, it has U6 snRNA and SAM synthetase RNA as conserved targets.
Although mammalian METTL16 and worm METT-10 methylate SAM synthetase RNA, mapping of the m 6 A-IP reads reveals very different locations for the modification. There are six methylation sites within the 3′ UTR of mammalian MAT2A SAM synthetase mRNA ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61. Pendleton, K.E. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Liu, K. ... The U6 snRNA m 6 A Methyltransferase METTL16 Regulates SAM Synthetase Intron Retention Cell. 2017; 169 :824-835.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ; Warda et al., 2017 85. Warda, A.S. ∙ Kretschmer, J. ∙ Hackert, P. ... Human METTL16 is a N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) methyltransferase that targets pre-mRNAs and various non-coding RNAs EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 :2004-2014 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, mapping of reads from three independent m 6 A-IP datasets to the worm genome reveals a single discrete peak over the intron 2/exon 3 junction of the s ams pre-mRNAs, and this signal is not detectable in the mett-10 KO ( Figure 2 A). This peak is seen when reads were mapped over the duplicated sams-3 , sams-4 , and sams-5 genes ( Figure S2 A). Because sams-3 and sams-4 are identical in sequence at this junction region and, hence, indistinguishable, we refer to these genes together in some of the analyses ( Figure 2 A). Compared with the methylation motif in worm U6 snRNA and in mammalian targets ( UAC m 6 A GA G A A), a variant motif is identified at the sams m 6 A peak ( UAC m 6 A GA A A C; identical sequences are underlined). Importantly, the methylated adenosine within this motif is at the 3ʹ splice site (AG) of intron 2 ( Figures 2 A and S2 B).
The significance of this finding became clear when we examined sequence databases. In addition to the mature spliced protein-coding (PC isoform) version of the sams-3/4 transcript, two noncoding versions that fail to use the 3′ splice site within intron 2 are detected ( Figures 2 C and S2 A). One noncoding version is an alternative splice (AS isoform) variant that uses an upstream cryptic 3′ splice site, and the other is an intron-retained version (IR isoform) that retains the complete intron 2. Compared with wild-type (WT) worms, the overall intron 2 read counts are lower in the mett-10 KO ( Figure 2 B), indicating its efficient splicing in the absence of 3′ splice site methylation. Consistent with this, quantification of splice junction reads in the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets shows that this particular 3′ splice site (producing the PC isoform) is used preferentially (∼8-fold higher) in the mett-10 KO, whereas use of the upstream AS site (producing the AS isoform) and intron 2 retention (IR isoform) is higher in the WT ( Figure 2 C). This suggests that m 6 A methylation at the 3ʹ splice site prevents its use and, instead, promotes use of an alternative upstream 3ʹ splice site or intron retention. The consequence of this m 6 A-mediated splicing inhibition is a general increase in sams mRNA levels in the mett-10 KO ( Figures 2 D and S2 C). We show that worms use METT-10-mediated 3ʹ splice site m 6 A methylation to inhibit splicing and production of SAM synthetase mRNA.
Methylation by mammalian METTL16 in the MAT2A 3′ UTR requires the presence of the methylation consensus motif in the context of a stem-loop structure ( Doxtader et al., 2018 20.

Similarly, secondary structure prediction shows that a 30-nt RNA fragment of the sams-3 pre-mRNA that spans the 3′ splice site folds into a stem-loop structure, with the consensus motif (UAC m 6 A GAAAC) occupying part of the loop region ( Figure 3 A). To confirm that this sequence can be methylated by worm METT-10, we incubated the 30-nt RNA with recombinant full-length worm METT-10 and radioactive 14 C-SAM as a methyl donor ( Figure 3 B). The RNA is methylated specifically at the 3′ splice site (AG) because mutation (A→U) of the adenosine abolishes this activity ( Figure 3 B, compare RNA-1 with RNA-2). Single or triple (CUU) mutations within the consensus motif ( Figure 3 B, RNA-4 and RNA-5) also abolish in vitro methylation activity of METT-10.
The stem region is also critical for methylation because placement of the motif within a single-stranded context (poly-C flanks) kills all activity, and this cannot be rescued by placing the motif alone within an artificial C:G stem ( Figure 3 B, RNA-8 and RNA-9). Similarly, large-scale mutations that disrupt the stem cannot be rescued ( Figure 3 C, RNA-10 and RNA-11). Interestingly, 2-nt mutations (RNA-12 and RNA-14) that disrupt pairing within the stem abolish activity, while compensatory mutations (RNA-13 and RNA-15) that restore pairing at these sites can rescue the activity ( Figure 3 C). Furthermore, a limited 6-bp artificial C:G stem (RNA-16) in the context of the original sequence supports activity ( Figure 3 C). These results show that the methylation consensus motif and stem-loop formation at the 3′ splice site of the sams pre-mRNA are prerequisites for its recognition by METT-10.
To directly analyze the effect of 3ʹ splice site m 6 A methylation in vivo , we prepared a wild-type (WT) transgene splicing reporter construct based on sams-3 ( STAR Methods ), where the 3ʹ splice site of intron 2 is methylated by METT-10. We also created a mutant (MUT) version where the methylation consensus motif has the mutations AAC→CUU, which, as we demonstrated, abolish methylation in vitro ( Figure 3 B). These mutations are in exon 3 and do not alter the 3′ splice site. The constructs were injected into the gonads of WT worms, and multiple independent progeny lines showing stable expression of the transgene were established ( Figure 3 D). Using adult transgenic worms, splicing of these constructs was investigated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with transgene-specific primers ( Table S3 ). Each experiment consisted of analysis of three independent progeny lines per construct and was repeated at least three times. We observed three distinct RT-PCR products: the unspliced or IR isoform, the AS isoform, and the correctly spliced mature PC isoform ( Figure 3 D). The MUT construct, which has mutations preventing m 6 A methylation ( Figure 3 B), shows increased use of the 3ʹ splice site and efficient splicing in vivo , as evidenced by higher PC isoform levels and a decrease in the AS isoform ( Figure 3 D). This demonstrates the direct role of m 6 A in preventing 3ʹ splice site recognition and inhibition of splicing. Consistent with the requirement of m 6 A methylation, there is no difference in splicing between WT and MUT transgenes when expressed in the mett-10 KO worms ( Figure S3 A). We show that it is the presence of an m 6 A at the 3ʹ splice site and not binding of METT-10 per se that regulates splicing and expression of the worm SAM synthetase transcript. This is in stark contrast to the mechanism used by METTL16 to regulate mammalian SAM synthetase pre-mRNA ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61. Pendleton, K.E. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Liu, K. ... The U6 snRNA m 6 A Methyltransferase METTL16 Regulates SAM Synthetase Intron Retention Cell. 2017; 169 :824-835.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interestingly, sams gene sequences surrounding the 3′ splice site from various Caenorhabditis species show strong conservation of the capacity to form the stem-loop structure, with the METT-10 methylation motif in the loop region ( Figure 3 E). Indeed, mutations found in the flanking regions in Caenorhabditis japonica are compensatory, allowing continued maintenance of pairing. Moreover, the motif can also be found at sams splice sites of other invertebrates, like the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the silk moth Bombyx mori ( Figure 3 F), indicating potential evolutionary conservation of this type of splicing regulation among invertebrates.
To functionally validate these insect 3′ splice sites as targets for m 6 A methylation, we carried out in vitro methylation assays with a 30-nt RNA spanning the region. We used human METTL16 ( Figure 3 F) or worm METT-10 ( Figure S3 B) as enzymes. The insect sequences are methylated specifically at the 3′ splice site (AG) adenosine within the consensus motif because mutation (A→U) of the splice site adenosine abolishes methylation of the RNA ( Figure 3 F). The homologous junction sequence from mouse Mat2a lacks the motif and is not methylated in this experiment, whereas the validated methylation site from the 3′ UTR of mouse Mat2a is methylated ( Figure 3 F). The presence of a conserved methylation motif within a structured RNA at the intron-exon boundary of invertebrate SAM synthetase pre-mRNA transcripts is required for 3′ splice site m 6 A methylation and splicing regulation.
C. elegans is a bacterium-eating soil nematode that proliferates on rotting vegetal substrates ( Félix and Duveau, 2012 22. Félix, M.-A. ∙ Duveau, F. Population dynamics and habitat sharing of natural populations of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae BMC Biol. 2012; 10 :59 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shtonda and Avery, 2006 75. Shtonda, B.B. ∙ Avery, L. Dietary choice behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209 :89-102 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), but it is maintained in the laboratory on food that consists of different strains (OP50 or NA22) of Escherichia coli . For all experiments described above, where we noted 3ʹ splice site methylation-mediated splicing inhibition, the worms were grown on nutrient-high agar plates (peptone-rich medium + NA22 strain; Table S4 ). Changing the diet to nutrient-low agar plates (peptone-poor medium + OP50 strain; Table S4 ) led to the surprising loss of this splicing regulation and a similar isoform expression pattern among WT and mett-10 KO worms ( Figure 4 A). RT-PCR analysis shows that intron 2 of the sams-3 transcript is spliced efficiently in WT worms grown on nutrient-low agar plates, as evidenced by reduced levels of the AS isoform ( Figure 4 A, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). In fact, the splicing pattern in WT worms grown on nutrient-low plates very much resembled the pattern seen in the mett-10 KO ( Figure 4 A), as if m 6 A methylation on the 3′ splice site was absent in WT worms. This diet-dependent change in splicing pattern of endogenous sams-3 was confirmed by RNA-seq analysis ( Figure S4 B) and also validated with our transgene reporter constructs based on sams-3 ( Figure S4 C).
To directly establish that splice site m 6 A methylation responds to a change in diet, we carried out m 6 A-IP-seq with poly(A) + RNA from WT and mett-10 KO worms grown on the two different diets. Strikingly, WT worms grown on nutrient-high plates display strong m 6 A methylation of the 3′ splice site within intron 2 of the sams-3 pre-mRNA, whereas this is reduced dramatically when WT worms are grown on nutrient-low plates ( Figures 4 B and S4 A). The mett-10 KO lacked this methylation under all conditions ( Figure 4 B), and, consequently, the splicing patterns were not altered when worms were grown on the different media ( Figures 4 A and S4 B). This allows us to conclude that 3′ splice site m 6 A methylation takes place in response to a nutrient-high diet to inhibit proper splicing and expression of SAM synthetase pre-mRNA.
Because RNA methylation depends on SAM as a methyl donor, we examined whether the pathway serves to regulate cellular SAM levels by feedback inhibition. To investigate this further, we asked which constituents in the diet are responsible for triggering splice site methylation. Keeping the bacterial strain constant (NA22 or OP50), we prepared plates with nutrient-low medium or peptone-rich nutrient-high medium ( Figure 4 C). Worms were grown on such plates, and RT-PCR analysis was conducted to examine splicing of intron 2 in the endogenous sams-3 pre-mRNA transcript. Irrespective of the bacterial strain used, the nutrient-high medium is responsible for strong splicing inhibition, as determined by quantification of the AS isoform ( Figure 4 C). Nevertheless, the level of splicing inhibition in nutrient-low plates is slightly higher when the NA22 bacterial strain is used, but the major driving factor was still the peptone-rich nutrient-high medium ( Figure 4 C).
Production of SAM requires enzymatic activities represented in the inter-linked methionine and folate cycles ( Figure 4 D). Briefly, SAM is produced from ATP and methionine by the SAM synthetase ( sams in worms) within the methionine cycle, whereas the downstream by-product homocysteine is regenerated to methionine via methionine synthase, which requires folate (5-methyl tetrahydrofolate) and the co-factor vitamin B12. Importantly, the key metabolites, like the essential amino acid methionine, folic acid, and vitamin B12, are all acquired through the diet. Consistent with this, supplementing the nutrient-low medium with additional free methionine or vitamin B12, which directly enhances SAM production via the methionine cycle, triggered splicing inhibition of sams-3 (as indicated by AS-isoform levels) similar to that seen with the nutrient-high medium ( Figure 4 C). However, supplementation with amino acids not involved in the methionine cycle (leucine and cysteine) or folic acid, which feeds into the folate cycle, did not lead to splicing inhibition. These results support a model of regulation by feedback inhibition, where constituents in the diet that directly increase cellular SAM levels via the methionine cycle trigger 3′ splice site m 6 A methylation and splicing inhibition/alternative splicing of SAM synthetase pre-mRNA. This ensures optimal cellular SAM levels. Interestingly, it is known that a diet of the OP50 E. coli strain causes vitamin B12 deficiency in worms ( Revtovich et al., 2019 64. Revtovich, A.V. ∙ Lee, R. ∙ Kirienko, N.V. Interplay between mitochondria and diet mediates pathogen and stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1008011 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), probably explaining the reduced sams-3 splicing inhibition compared with the NA22 strain ( Figure 4 C), and it also explains the reduced recycling of the by-product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) via the methionine cycle under the nutrient-low diet (with the OP50 strain) condition ( Figure 4 E).
Validating the above model, metabolomics analyses ( Figure 4 E) show that, although WT worms are able to control SAM levels, the mett-10 KO fails to do so. When grown on a nutrient-high diet that supplies an abundance of methionine, WT worms are able to maintain similar levels of SAM as under nutrient-low diet conditions ( Figure 4 E). Loss of mett-10 upsets this homeostasis, resulting in elevated SAM concentrations under both diet conditions, with the levels being higher under the nutrient-high condition ( Figure 4 E). Thus, conditions that favor increased SAM production (such as nutrient-high diet) trigger m 6 A methylation of the splice site in intron 2 of the sams-3/4 pre-mRNA to inhibit production of the PC isoform version of SAM synthetase mRNA, regulating SAM biosynthesis. To directly verify protein levels of the enzyme during this regulation, we created a worm strain with SAMS-3 hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged at the endogenous locus and then derived a strain with intron 2 removed from the gene ( STAR Methods ; Table S5 ). Consistent with the RNA analyses, we observe a reduction in SAMS-3-HA protein levels under the nutrient-high diet condition ( Figures 4 F and S4 D), and this depends on METT-10 and the presence of intron 2 in the sams-3-HA genomic locus ( Figures 4 F, S4 D, and S4E). The level of the RNA methyltransferase (METT-10-FLAG; STAR Methods ) does not change under the two dietary conditions ( Figures 4 F and S4 F). Thus, m 6 A-mediated reduction in protein levels of a key enzyme within the methionine cycle explains how WT worms cope with a diet that fuels this biosynthetic pathway to ensure SAM homeostasis.
Loss of mett-10 results in a fertility defect phenotype ( Dorsett et al., 2009 19. Dorsett, M. ∙ Westlund, B. ∙ Schedl, T. METT-10, a putative methyltransferase, inhibits germ cell proliferative fate in Caenorhabditis elegans Genetics. 2009; 183 :233-247 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), and here we examined the effect of diet. Compared with WT control animals, the mett-10 KO has a reduced brood size with a nutrient-low diet, but this becomes worse with a nutrient-high diet, with very few progenies ( Figure 4 G). Interestingly, a triple-mutant worm strain ( Table S5 ) lacking intron 2 in the three sams genes ( sams-3 Δintron2 , sams-4 Δintron2 , and sams-5 Δintron2 ) also shows a small but significant reduction in brood size ( Figure 4 G). This shows that the ability to tune down SAM levels in response to a rich diet, using the m 6 A-mediated splicing inhibition pathway we describe here, contributes to ensuring normal fertility in worms. Finally, the difference in the severity of the phenotypes of the mett-10 KO and the triple mutant points to the existence of additional METT-10 targets that are required for fertility.
The above experiments show that worm METT-10 regulates splicing of sams pre-mRNA through m 6 A methylation of a specific 3ʹ splice site. Because the basic mechanism of splicing is highly conserved from yeast to human ( Fica and Nagai, 2017 23. Fica, S.M. ∙ Nagai, K.

Structural insights into nuclear pre-mRNA splicing in higher eukaryotes Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11 :a032417 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wanted to find out whether the m 6 A-mediated inhibitory pathway can be active in the mammalian system. To investigate this, we transfected the transgene reporter constructs based on worm sams-3 into human HeLa cell cultures ( Figure 5 A). We already know that the 3′ splice site within worm sams-3 RNA can be methylated by human METTL16 ( Figures 3 F and S5 A). Strikingly, RT-PCR analysis of this reporter with the WT sequences revealed a splicing pattern similar to that seen when the same construct was expressed in worms, with 3′ splice site methylation reducing its use and promoting alternative splicing (AS isoform) via use of a cryptic upstream 3ʹ splice site ( Figures 5 A and S5 B). As seen in worms, the transgene reporter with mutations (MUT, AAC→CUU) in the methylation consensus motif allows increased 3′ splice site use, reducing levels of the AS isoform ( Figures 5 A and S5 B). Thus, using this ectopic reporter system, we demonstrate that human METTL16 can catalyze 3′ splice site m 6 A methylation, which leads to splicing modulation in human cells.
Next we wanted to know whether the observed splicing modulation is a direct consequence of the m 6 A mark or whether the stem-loop structure that is required for recruitment of METTL16 plays any role. To demonstrate that the inhibitory effect is directly due to the presence of m 6 A, we artificially introduced an m 6 A at the 3′ splice site (by splint ligation; STAR Methods ) of the unrelated human β-globin pre-mRNA and carried out in vitro splicing assays ( Krainer et al., 1984 39. Krainer, A.R. ∙ Maniatis, T. ∙ Ruskin, B. ... Normal and mutant human beta-globin pre-mRNAs are faithfully and efficiently spliced in vitro Cell. 1984; 36 :993-1005 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). To this end, we prepared 32 P-labeled splicing substrates and incubated them with human HeLa S3 extracts ( Figure 5 B). Splicing takes place via two transesterification reactions ( Fica and Nagai, 2017 23. Fica, S.M. ∙ Nagai, K.

Biol. 2011; 3 :a003707 Crossref Scopus (811) PubMed Google Scholar ). In step 1, the free 5′ exon and the intron lariat-3′ exon intermediate are produced. In step 2, exon ligation joins the 5′ exon with the 3′ exon, releasing the branched lariat. Splicing of the unmethylated substrate proceeded normally, as expected ( Padgett et al., 1984 57. Padgett, R.A. ∙ Konarska, M.M. ∙ Grabowski, P.J. ... Lariat RNA’s as intermediates and products in the splicing of messenger RNA precursors Science. 1984; 225 :898-903 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ruskin et al., 1984 67.

Excision of an intact intron as a novel lariat structure during pre-mRNA splicing in vitro Cell. 1984; 38 :317-331 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (459) PubMed Google Scholar ), with production of the lariat intermediate and the mature spliced product observed ( Figures 5 B and S5 C). However, splicing of the substrate with the m 6 A modification at the 3ʹ splice site was blocked completely because the lariat and the mature product were absent ( Figures 5 B and S5 C). Placing the m 6 A mark in the exonic part of the substrate did not hinder splicing ( Figures 5 B and S5 C), demonstrating the specificity of the 3ʹ splice site inhibitory mechanism. Thus, we conclude that the human splicing machinery is also sensitive to the presence of m 6 A at the 3′ splice site, and this directly inhibits the first step of the splicing reaction.
Recognition by splicing factors of the key cis elements within the pre-mRNA is critical for initiation of splicing in metazoans. The 5ʹ splice site is recognized by the U1 snRNP, the branchpoint sequence (BPS) by the mammalian branchpoint binding protein (mBBP)/SF1, and the 3ʹ splice site is bound by the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF). mBBP/SF1 and U2AF then promote recruitment of the U2 snRNP, which pairs with the branch-site sequence. U2AF is a heterodimer composed of the U2AF35 and U2AF65 subunits ( Zamore and Green, 1989 95. Zamore, P.D. ∙ Green, M.R. Identification, purification, and biochemical characterization of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :9243-9247 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). While U2AF65 recognizes the polypyrimidine tract that precedes the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon junction ( Sickmier et al., 2006 76. Sickmier, E.A. ∙ Frato, K.E. ∙ Shen, H. ...

The splicing factor U2AF35 mediates critical protein-protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing Genes Dev. 1996; 10 :1356-1368 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). U2AF35 is highly conserved from fission yeast to human and essential for splicing in vivo in worms ( Zorio and Blumenthal, 1999b 104. Zorio, D.A. ∙ Blumenthal, T. U2AF35 is encoded by an essential gene clustered in an operon with RRM/cyclophilin in Caenorhabditis elegans RNA. 1999; 5 :487-494 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and flies ( Rudner et al., 1996 66.

USA. 1996; 93 :10333-10337 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
This prompted us to examine whether 3′ splice site methylation can hinder U2AF35 binding. Our attempts to express full-length human or worm U2AF35 alone in a recombinant form were unsuccessful. However, we could stabilize fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) full-length U2AF35 by expressing it in complex ( Yoshida et al., 2015 94. Yoshida, H. ∙ Park, S.Y. ∙ Oda, T. ... A novel 3′ splice site recognition by the two zinc fingers in the U2AF small subunit Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :1649-1660 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a minimal fragment of U2AF65 (the U2AF35-interacting region) lacking the RNA binding domains ( Zamore et al., 1992 96. Zamore, P.D. ∙ Patton, J.G. ∙ Green, M.R. Cloning and domain structure of the mammalian splicing factor U2AF Nature. 1992; 355 :609-614 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 C; STAR Methods ). U2AF35 with its two zinc fingers ( Figure S6 A) is the only component in this complex with the ability to bind RNA, hence, hereafter, this preparation will be referred to as U2AF35. We used a short RNA fragment mimicking the 3ʹ splice site (AG) to test interactions with U2AF35. Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments revealed that, although U2AF35 strongly (K D = 1.75 μM) interacts with the unmethylated RNA, the presence of 3ʹ splice site m 6 A decreases the affinity by an order of magnitude (K D = 41.8 μM) ( Figures 5 C and S6 B–S6D). Thus, the 3ʹ splice site m 6 A inhibits splicing by physically hindering its recognition by the essential splicing factor U2AF35.
Of the different splicing signals within the intron, the polypyrimidine tract is the most variable. Its composition, measured by the number of uridines in the tract ( Singh et al., 1995 77. Singh, R. ∙ Valcárcel, J. ∙ Green, M.R.

Zamore, P.D. ∙ Patton, J.G. ∙ Green, M.R. Cloning and domain structure of the mammalian splicing factor U2AF Nature. 1992; 355 :609-614 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), defines the strength of the 3ʹ splice site ( Moore, 2000 55. Moore, M.J. Intron recognition comes of AGe Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7 :14-16 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reed, 1989 63. Reed, R. The organization of 3′ splice-site sequences in mammalian introns Genes Dev. 1989; 3 :2113-2123 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In vitro splicing of an intron with a strong polypyrimidine tract (AG-independent introns) requires only U2AF65 ( Valcárcel et al., 1996 82. Valcárcel, J. ∙ Gaur, R.K. ∙ Singh, R. ...

Zamore, P.D. ∙ Patton, J.G. ∙ Green, M.R. Cloning and domain structure of the mammalian splicing factor U2AF Nature. 1992; 355 :609-614 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas that with a weak polypyrimidine tract (AG-dependent introns) additionally requires U2AF35, which recognizes the AG dinucleotide ( Wu et al., 1999 91. Wu, S. ∙ Romfo, C.M. ∙ Nilsen, T.W. ... Functional recognition of the 3′ splice site AG by the splicing factor U2AF35 Nature. 1999; 402 :832-835 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, although the conserved AG dinucleotide at the 3ʹ splice site is only required for the second step of splicing during exon ligation, AG-dependent introns require its recognition by U2AF35 early during spliceosome assembly and for the first step of splicing ( Reed, 1989 63. Reed, R. The organization of 3′ splice-site sequences in mammalian introns Genes Dev. 1989; 3 :2113-2123 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 1999 91. Wu, S. ∙ Romfo, C.M. ∙ Nilsen, T.W. ... Functional recognition of the 3′ splice site AG by the splicing factor U2AF35 Nature. 1999; 402 :832-835 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine whether splicing inhibition by 3′ splice site m 6 A depends on the type of intron involved, we experimented with the MINX (an adenovirus major late pre-mRNA derivative) splicing substrate ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Compared with the β-globin pre-mRNA substrate, the MINX substrate has a strong polypyrimidine tract with a run of eight uridines (U 8 ), identifying the intron as AG independent ( Figure 5 F). When incubated with HeLa S3 extracts, the unmethylated MINX substrate is spliced, with the lariat intermediate and spliced product visible ( Figure 5 D). Interestingly, the MINX substrate with an m 6 A-methylated 3′ splice site is also spliced, albeit with slightly lower efficiency ( Figure 5 D). This is contrary to the observation for the β-globin pre-mRNA substrate, where the 3′ splice site m 6 A completely inhibits splicing ( Figure 5 B). This suggests that the inhibitory effect of 3′ splice site m 6 A is dependent on the type of intron being regulated. To verify whether this is due to the presence of a strong polypyrimidine tract (U 8 ), we introduced mutations to convert the MINX construct into a substrate with only four uridines (U 4 ) ( Figure 5 F). Strikingly, splicing of such a MINX pre-mRNA substrate with a weakened polypyrimidine tract (effectively making it an AG-dependent intron) is abolished completely in the presence of a 3′ splice site m 6 A ( Figure 5 E). An exonic methylation does not affect splicing of either substrate. This indicates that AG-dependent introns with a weakened polypyrimidine tract are sensitive to a 3′ splice site m 6 A because they require recognition by U2AF35 of the AG dinucleotide for efficient U2AF recruitment.
In this context, it is worth mentioning that introns in C. elegans lack the polypyrimidine tract consensus sequence as in other metazoans but instead have a conserved consensus sequence, U 4 CAG ( Figure 5 F), at the 3′ end ( Blumenthal and Steward, 1997 9. Blumenthal, T. ∙ Steward, K. C. elegans II Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1997 Google Scholar ). The U 4 C sequence in this consensus sequence is bound by worm U2AF65, but this association is enhanced by simultaneous binding of worm U2AF35 to the AG dinucleotide ( Zorio and Blumenthal, 1999a 103. Zorio, D.A. ∙ Blumenthal, T. Both subunits of U2AF recognize the 3′ splice site in Caenorhabditis elegans Nature. 1999; 402 :835-838 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that splicing of AG-dependent introns, which rely on U2AF35 binding to the AG dinucleotide to recruit the U2AF complex, can be regulated by m 6 A methylation of the 3′ splice site ( Figure 5 G).
Although we demonstrated that splicing inhibition by 3′ splice site m 6 A methylation is conserved in mammals, mammalian METTL16 was not shown to methylate 3′ splice sites of mammalian pre-mRNAs. Mammalian METTL16 regulates its conserved SAM synthetase MAT2A RNA target by promoting splicing via its non-catalytic C-terminal VCRs ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61. Pendleton, K.E. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Liu, K. ... The U6 snRNA m 6 A Methyltransferase METTL16 Regulates SAM Synthetase Intron Retention Cell. 2017; 169 :824-835.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). Loss of Mettl16 causes pre-implantation embryonic lethality in mice ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine the in vivo relevance of its catalytic activity, we created a knockin mouse mutant carrying mutations in the catalytic motif ( Figures S7 A and S7B; STAR Methods ). Although the heterozygous mutants are viable and fertile, homozygous catalytic-dead Mettl16 mutants are never recovered in the born litters, indicating developmental lethality ( Figure 6 A). Similarly, mutations designed to cause loss of RNA-binding activity also result in lethality ( Figure 6 A). METTL16 has a tissue-specific expression pattern in adult mice, with strong enrichment in the gonads ( Figure 6 B). To probe its relevance for fertility, we engineered conditional deletion of Mettl16 in the mouse germline ( Figure S7 C; STAR Methods ). Such conditional KO (cKO) males are infertile, as evidenced by atrophied testes ( Figure 6 C) and arrested germ cell development ( Figure 6 D). Taken together, our genetic analyses reveal an essential role of the catalytic activity of METTL16 during mouse development and show that the protein is also relevant outside of the embryonic stages.
Next we identified putative mammalian targets for METTL16-mediated 3′ splice site m 6 A methylation ( STAR Methods ). Briefly, these sites overlap one of the METTL16/METT-10 methylation motifs (UAC m 6 A GAGA or UAC m 6 A GAAA) and are present within a stem-loop structure ( Figure 6 E). Direct testing of the top 10 such sequences with recombinant human METTL16 shows that several of these are methylated efficiently in vitro ( Figure 6 F). To examine whether any of these putative targets are regulated differentially in the absence of Mettl16 , we used single-embryo RNA-seq datasets prepared from Mettl 16 KO embryonic day 2.5 (E2.5) morulae and E3.5 blastocysts ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). This identified Sorbs1 and Lrpprc as two transcripts that have increased use of the 3′ splice site in the Mettl16 KO ( Figure 6 G). Furthermore, the target splice sites in these transcripts can be methylated in vitro by recombinant METTL16 ( Figure 6 G). Although our computational and biochemical analyses reveal the existence of putative 3ʹ splice site targets for mammalian METTL16, it remains to be seen whether they are indeed regulated by METTL16 in vivo .

Section: Discussion

SAM is the major methyl donor for methylation reactions in the cell ( Cantoni, 1975 13. Cantoni, G.L. Biological methylation: selected aspects Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44 :435-451 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar ). Production of SAM from methionine and ATP via the methionine cycle is carried out by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) or SAM synthetase, which is conserved from prokaryotes to humans. One conserved principle for regulation of SAM synthetase gene expression is use of RNA structures. Prokaryotes use complex RNA structures, called riboswitches, present in the 5′ leader sequence of SAM synthetase mRNA for feedback regulation by inhibiting translation or attenuating transcription ( Batey, 2011 6. Batey, R.T. Recognition of S-adenosylmethionine by riboswitches Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2011; 2 :299-311 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mandal and Breaker, 2004 49. Mandal, M. ∙ Breaker, R.R. Gene regulation by riboswitches Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5 :451-463 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding of SAM alters the RNA structure, leading to gene repression; for example, by occluding key features like the Shine-Dalgarno sequence required for translation initiation ( Breaker, 2018 10. Breaker, R.R. Riboswitches and translation control Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10 :a032797 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even in eukaryotes, fission yeast SAM synthetase sam1 mRNA has a tertiary structure feature in the 5ʹ UTR, which, upon SAM binding, undergoes structural transition to regulate translation ( Zhang et al., 2020 99. Zhang, X. ∙ Sun, W. ∙ Chen, D. ... Interactions between SAM and the 5′ UTR mRNA of the sam1 gene regulate translation in S. pombe RNA. 2020; 26 :150-161 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mammals use a different strategy to regulate MAT2A SAM synthetase expression that does not involve direct binding of SAM. Six hairpin structures in the 3′ UTR of the MAT2A pre-mRNA bind the m 6 A writer METTL16, which uses its non-catalytic C-terminal VCRs to enhance splicing of a frequently retained terminal intron ( Pendleton et al., 2017 61. Pendleton, K.E. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Liu, K. ... The U6 snRNA m 6 A Methyltransferase METTL16 Regulates SAM Synthetase Intron Retention Cell. 2017; 169 :824-835.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ). The role of SAM in this process is as a molecular regulator of METTL16’s dwell time at the 3′ UTR; low levels increase dwell time, whereas high levels, which lead to m 6 A methylation of the hairpins, rapidly evict the protein from the pre-mRNA ( Figure 7 ). The VCR has also been shown to facilitate binding to the U6 snRNA ( Aoyama et al., 2020 2. Aoyama, T. ∙ Yamashita, S. ∙ Tomita, K. Mechanistic insights into m6A modification of U6 snRNA by human METTL16 Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :5157-5168 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we show that the worm METTL16 ortholog METT-10 inhibits SAM synthetase pre-mRNA splicing via 3′ splice site m 6 A methylation in response to a rich diet. Identification of the precise 3′ splice site is by its presence within a stem-loop structure. Conservation of these sequence elements within SAM synthetase genes implies that this type of regulation might be common in invertebrates ( Figures 3 E and 3F).
Our findings also highlight the different strategies used to regulate SAM synthetase expression. Prokaryotes and invertebrates negatively regulate SAM production in response to high intracellular SAM levels. On the other hand, mammalian systems have opted for a mechanism that allows them to increase SAM production, probably to suit the requirements of early embryonic development, where optimal SAM levels are critical for survival of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) ( Shiraki et al., 2014 74. Shiraki, N. ∙ Shiraki, Y. ∙ Tsuyama, T. ... Methionine metabolism regulates maintenance and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells Cell Metab. 2014; 19 :780-794 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) and development of embryos ( Sun et al., 2019 80. Sun, H. ∙ Kang, J. ∙ Su, J. ... Methionine adenosyltransferase 2A regulates mouse zygotic genome activation and morula to blastocyst transition Biol. Reprod. 2019; 100 :601-617 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). This critical role explains why mice lacking METTL16 die early during embryogenesis ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas worms lacking METT-10 are viable ( Dorsett et al., 2009 19. Dorsett, M. ∙ Westlund, B. ∙ Schedl, T. METT-10, a putative methyltransferase, inhibits germ cell proliferative fate in Caenorhabditis elegans Genetics. 2009; 183 :233-247 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) because they just need to cope with the aberrantly high levels of SAM after a rich diet ( Figure 4 E). Nevertheless, the observed phenotypes of the mett-10 KO and the sams triple mutant lacking intron 2 ( Figure 4 G) demonstrate that the ability to dial down SAM production in response to a rich diet is important for ensuring normal fertility in worms ( Figure 4 G).
Previous studies have linked m 6 A methylation to splicing regulation, and they document splicing changes in the absence of an m 6 A writer ( Haussmann et al., 2016 27. Haussmann, I.U. ∙ Bodi, Z. ∙ Sanchez-Moran, E. ... m 6 A potentiates Sxl alternative pre-mRNA splicing for robust Drosophila sex determination Nature. 2016; 540 :301-304 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lence et al., 2016 43. Lence, T. ∙ Akhtar, J. ∙ Bayer, M. ... m 6 A modulates neuronal functions and sex determination in Drosophila Nature. 2016; 540 :242-247 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), reader ( Kasowitz et al., 2018 35.

Cell. 2019; 76 :70-81.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), or eraser ( Bartosovic et al., 2017 5. Bartosovic, M. ∙ Molares, H.C. ∙ Gregorova, P. ... N6-methyladenosine demethylase FTO targets pre-mRNAs and regulates alternative splicing and 3′-end processing Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :11356-11370 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2014 100. Zhao, X. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Sun, B.F. ... FTO-dependent demethylation of N6-methyladenosine regulates mRNA splicing and is required for adipogenesis Cell Res. 2014; 24 :1403-1419 Crossref Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study identifies a direct role of the modification in interfering with splicing via precise methylation of a key sequence feature used by the splicing machinery. This mechanism is direct because it repels an essential splicing factor, U2AF35, leading to an early spliceosome assembly defect.
The strong fertility defect seen in the mett-10 KO worms ( Dorsett et al., 2009 19. Dorsett, M. ∙ Westlund, B. ∙ Schedl, T. METT-10, a putative methyltransferase, inhibits germ cell proliferative fate in Caenorhabditis elegans Genetics. 2009; 183 :233-247 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) sharply contrasts the relatively mild phenotype in the triple mutant, where intron 2 is deleted in the sams-3/4/5 genes ( Figure 4 G). This points to the existence of additional targets for METT-10 that may contribute to fertility. Alternatively, although we did not observe any global splicing differences ( Figure S1 J), it is possible that loss of U6 snRNA m 6 A methylation in the mett-10 KO may affect splicing of specific genes. We show that the 3ʹ splice site m 6 A inhibits splicing in C. elegans , and it is also active in human cell cultures and in in vitro HeLa splicing extracts, but there is no evidence of its actual use in splicing regulation in mammals. We identified several putative 3ʹ splice sites that are methylated by METTL16 in vitro or have, as an isolated RNA sequence, all requirements for methylation. It is possible that many of these sites are never methylated in vivo because transcription kinetics ( Herzel et al., 2017 28. Herzel, L. ∙ Ottoz, D.S.M. ∙ Alpert, T. ... Splicing and transcription touch base: co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and function Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :637-650 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ) may affect the ability of the region to fold into the required stem-loop structure for methylation. Even for the two transcripts ( Sorbs1 and Lrpprc ) that show altered splicing patterns in the Mettl16 KO embryos, it is not clear whether this is actually due to m 6 A methylation of the specific 3ʹ splice sites. A search for such mammalian targets will have to involve analysis of specific cell types or tissues under specific developmental or environmental conditions. Nevertheless, given the conservation of the mechanisms involved, our work identifies 3′ splice site methylation as an ancient strategy for splicing control.

Mettl16 gene locus is located in mouse on chromosome 10 and consists of 10 exons ( Figure 7 A). The locus was modified (Transgenic Core Facility of the University of Geneva) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce mutations meant to destroy the RNA methylation activity (F187G) and RNA-binding activity (185PP-AA186) of METTL16 ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mouse embryos of the B6D2F1/J hybrid line (also called B6D2; The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 100006) were used. This line is a cross between C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) and is heterozygous for all B6 and D2 alleles. Single-cell mouse embryos were injected with a single guide RNA (gRNA) and a 200 nucleotides long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) repair template (IDT, Belgium). Sequences of the gRNA and ssDNA repair templates are provided ( Table S3 ). Template for F187G mutation had a mutation CCTCCC TTT to CCTCCC GGC , while the template for 185PP-AA186 mutation had CCTCCC TTT to GCCGCA TTT ( Figure 7 A).
Founder male mice were crossed with wild-type C57BL/6J (Janvier) female partners to obtain germline transmission. Heterozygous male and female animals from the F1 generation were crossed with each other to obtain homozygotes. To genotype the animals, we PCR-amplified the region around the mutations and sequenced the PCR products ( Figure S7 B). While male and female heterozygotes for both mutations were detected, there were no homozygotes at weaning age (P21), pointing to potential embryonic lethality due to loss of either catalytic activity or loss of RNA-binding ability of METTL16 ( Figure 6 A).
Mettl16 tm1a(KOMP)Mbp mouse was obtained from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP; https://www.komp.org/ ) repository at University of California, Davis, USA. Mettl16 tm1a(KOMP)Mbp mouse has the L1L2_Bact_P gene-trapping cassette inserted between exon 6 and exon 9 of the Mettl16 gene ( Figure S7 C). This cassette has multiple functionalities. By default, it functions as a gene-trap as it has a LacZ ORF with a polyadenylation signal that is preceded by a splice acceptor site. Thus, the upstream exons of Mettl16 pre-mRNA will become spliced to the LacZ sequence, and the polyadenylation signal will ensure that transcription terminates prematurely on the Mettl16 locus. In addition, the cassette also brings two loxP sites flanking exons 7 and 8 of Mettl16 , allowing conditional knockout (cKO) of the gene.
To allow for the conditional knockout of Mettl16 gene, the FRT-flanked gene-trap cassette is removed by crosses with a mouse line expressing FLP recombinase from the ubiquitous ROSA26 promoter [B6.129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm1(FLP1)Dym /RainJ, The Jackson Laboratory]. Gene-trap cassette removal leaves behind only the loxP sites flanking exons 7 and 8, creating the male and female heterozygous floxed Mettl16 loxP/+ mice (Figure S7C). The Mettl16 loxP/+ male and female mice were crossed with each other to obtain homozygous male and female floxed Mettl16 loxP/loxP mice. In order to delete Mettl16 in the germline, a mouse line expressing Cre recombinase under germline-specific promoter ( Ddx4 ) was obtained: FVB-Tg(Ddx4-cre)1Dcas/J (The Jackson Laboratory). This line (males or females) was first crossed with male or female Mettl16 +/− heterozygous knockout animals carrying a null allele ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), producing the male and female Mettl16 -/+ ;Ddx4 -Cre animals. These male or female animals were next crossed with the male or female Mettl16 loxP/loxP line, generating male and female animals with conditional knockout (cKO, Mettl16 loxP/- ;Ddx4-Cre ) of the floxed Mettl16 allele in the germline and male and female Mettl16 heterozygotes ( Mettl16 loxP/+- ;Ddx4-Cre ). The germline-specific expression of Ddx4 starts approximately at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) in male embryos, leading to early deletion of Mettl16 in the testes. Such cKO males were found to be infertile due to an early block in spermatogenesis and had atrophied testes ( Figures 6 C and 6D). The conditional deletion of Mettl16 is also expected to take place in the female germline, but we did not examine impact on fertility in such cKO females.
Ear punches of weaned male and female animals (21 days-old) were digested for 120 min at 95°C in 100 μl of buffer containing 10 mM NaOH and 0.1 mM EDTA. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, 50 μL of supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing 50 μL of TE buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.1 mM EDTA). 1.5 μl of digestion mix was used for PCR with Phire Greeen Hot Start II PCR Mix (F126L, Thermo Fisher). The annealing temperatures were calculated using Tm calculator (Thermo Fisher). Reactions were examined by 2% agarose gel (Promega, cat.no. V3125) electrophoresis ( Figure S7 C).
For genotyping the male and female conditional Mettl16 knockout mice, the primers sequences are provided ( Table S3 ), so is a representative gel showing the PCR products ( Figure S7 C). For genotyping the Mettl16 loxP/loxP mice primers MM101 and MM102 were used ( Table S3 ) to detect loxP inserted into the region (WT PCR product: 474 bp, loxP PCR: 439 bp). To genotype conditional Mettl16 knockout mice ( Mettl16 loxP/- ;Ddx4-Cre) primers (oIMR7643, oIMR7644) detecting Ddx4-Cre (PCR product size: 240 bp) as well as detecting Mettl16 +/− (MM314, MM315; PCR product size: 296 bp) were used. Representative gels showing the PCR products are shown ( Figure S7 C).
For genotyping the male and female point mutant Mettl16 mice, a region of 308 bp around the mutation site was amplified using MM340 and MM341 primers ( Table S3 ) and Phire Green Hit Start II polymerase producing a 308 bp PCR product. PCR conditions: 98°C for 1 min., 30 x (98°C for 5 s, 65°C for 10 s., 72°C for 15 s.), 72°C for 1 min., 4°C hold. PCR products were purified with QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit (cat.no. 28106, QIAGEN) and sent for Sanger sequencing (Fasteris SA, Geneva) ( Figure S7 B). Having confirmed the existence of the mutations in the genome, we then designed primers that allow routine genotyping by specific detection of the mutations by genomic PCR. To this end, primers MM342 and MM343 (269 bp PCR product) were used to detect F187G mutation, primers MM348 and MM349 (265 bp PCR product) to detect PP185-186AA mutation ( Table S3 ). The PCR reaction conditions were identical for both mutations: 98°C for 1 min., 30 x (98°C for 5 s, 65°C for 10 s., 72°C for 15 s.), 72°C for 1 min., 4°C hold.
C. elegans strains were grown under the standard OP50 conditions for maintenance ( Brenner, 1974 11. Brenner, S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans Genetics. 1974; 77 :71-94 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). For experiments, the worms were fed one of the two diets: nutrient-low media ( E. coli bacterial strain OP50 on NGM plates) or nutrient-high media ( E. coli strain NA22 on peptone-rich plates), as detailed ( Table S4 ) and indicated for each experiment. N2 (Bristol strain) was used as wild-type, unless otherwise indicated. The list of strains used in this study can be found in Table S5 . All of the C. elegans experiments and worm maintenance was carried out at 20°C.
For culture conditions were the nutrient-low media was supplemented with various components, the nutrient-low OP50 plates were prepared with additional methionine (Sigma, cat. no. M5308), leucine (Sigma, cat. no. L8912) or cysteine (Sigma, cat. no. C7602) (with the final concentration of 10 mM for each aminoacid), with folic acid (Sigma, cat. no. F8758) (100 μM concentration) or vitamin B12 (Sigma, cat. no. V6629) (73 nM concentration). The required additional components were added to the cooled autoclaved media, just before pouring plates.
All of the genome editing for strain creation was performed in the endogenous loci of sams-3, sams-4, sams-5 and mett-10 genes using CRISPR/Cas-9 technology as described in Arribere et al. (2014) 3. Arribere, J.A. ∙ Bell, R.T. ∙ Fu, B.X. ... Efficient marker-free recovery of custom genetic modifications with CRISPR/Cas9 in Caenorhabditis elegans Genetics. 2014; 198 :837-846 Crossref Scopus (301) PubMed Google Scholar . In brief, Cas-9 and sgRNAs in the form of plasmids and repair templates as single-stranded oligonucleotides were delivered to the worm germ cells through microinjection into the gonad. Sequences of sgRNAs, repair templates and plasmids used to detect and sequence the edits are indicated in the Table S3 . SAMS-3 was tagged with 2xHA on C terminus, METT-10 was tagged with 3xFLAG and 1xHA on the C terminus, intron 2 was removed from sams-3 , sams-4 and sams-5 ( Figure 4 F). All of the edits were performed on the endogenous copy of the genes. For intron 2 deletions, multiple alleles were generated in different genetic backgrounds ( Figure 4 G).
For the transgene reporter constructs experiments ( Figures 3 D and S3 A), either the wild-type N2 (Bristol strain) or the mett-10 knockout VC1743 strain was used for plasmid injections. Generation of extrachromosomal arrays was carried out via microinjection as described in WormBook” ( Evans, 2006 21. Evans, T.C. Transformation and microinjection WormBook, ed. The C. elegans Research Community, 2006 https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.108.1 , http://www.wormbook.org Google Scholar ) Briefly, the plasmids containing WT or MUT transgene reporter constructs were co-injected along with reporter plasmids pRF4 [ rol-6 ( su1006 ), causes roller phenotype due to a cuticle defect] and pCFJ421 [Pmyo-2::GFP::H2B (pharynx)] into the gonads of young adult wild-type or mett-10 knockout worms. Concentrations of plasmid injected are 5 ng/μl (transgene reporter constructs), 2 ng/μl (pRF4) and 5 ng/μl (pCFJ421). Progenies displaying phenotypes induced by presence of reporter plasmids (rollers with strong pharyngeal GFP signal) were singled out. The constructs are expected to be maintained as extrachromosomal arrays. In the following generation, 6 lines showing the highest rate of array transmission were identified and the presence of WT or MUT plasmid was confirmed by RT-PCR using MM363 and MM364 primers ( Table S3 ). The transgenic lines were maintained by picking rollers. For the splicing analysis, we used three independent lines for the triplicate repetitions. For each repetition, 30 rollers were picked into 100 ul of TRIzol (Thermo Fisher, cat.no. 15596026).
For analysis of wild-type and mett-10 knock-out (VC1743) worms, synchronized adult population was washed off either from 15 cm plates (in case of NA22) or from 6 cm plate (in case of OP50). Worms were washed 3 times in M9 buffer (3 g KH 2 PO 4 , 6 g Na 2 HPO 4 , 5 g NaCl, 1 mL 1 M MgSO 4 in 1l H 2 O), put in Trizol (3x volume of the worm pellet), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until the RNA isolation.
Cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC). HeLa cells (ECACC, cat. no. 93021013) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, cat. no. 21969-035) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher; cat. no. 10270106), 1% Penicilline/Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher; cat. no. 15140122), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher; cat. no. 25030024). HeLa S3 (ECACC, cat. no. 87110901) were grown in spinner flasks (Corning, cat. No. 4500-125) in MEM medium supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1% Non Essential Amino Acids (NEAA) (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 11140050), 1% Penicilline/Streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher). Both cell types were maintained in an environment with 5% CO 2 at 37°C. HeLa cells were sub-cultured at 1:5 ratio every 3 to 4 days using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO, cat. no. 25300054), while HeLa S3 were counted daily using Neubauer chamber and maintained at the 200 000 – 500 000 cells/mL concentration by diluting the culture with growth media.
The C. elegans METT-10 (Wormbase: CE31860), was cloned by RT-PCR amplification from adult worm total RNA. The sams-3 SAM synthetase gene (Wormbase: CE03957) was PCR amplified from worm genomic DNA. The cDNAs for yeast ( S. pombe ) U2AF35 (U2AF23, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: Q09176.2) and yU2AF65 (U2AF59, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P36629.1) were synthesized (Thermo Fisher).
The untagged full-length yeast ( S. pombe ) U2AF35 (U2AF23) and a tagged (6xHis-StrepII) fragment (93-161 aa) of yU2AF65 (U2AF59) were co-expressed in E. coli and purified as a complex. This minimal fragment of yU2AF65 (93-161 aa) is essential and sufficient for ensuring stability of yU2AF35 ( Yoshida et al., 2015 94. Yoshida, H. ∙ Park, S.Y. ∙ Oda, T. ... A novel 3′ splice site recognition by the two zinc fingers in the U2AF small subunit Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :1649-1660 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). The required ORFs were cloned into the pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen) for co-expression in E. coli . We also prepared complexes where the yU2AF35 has specific point mutations in the zinc finger 1 ( Figures S6 B–S6D). The Arginine 35 in ZF1 is proposed to be involved in recognition of the splice site adenosine ( Yoshida et al., 2015 94. Yoshida, H. ∙ Park, S.Y. ∙ Oda, T. ... A novel 3′ splice site recognition by the two zinc fingers in the U2AF small subunit Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :1649-1660 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). A conservative mutation to a positively-charged lysine (R35K) or to a non-conservative mutation to uncharged serine (R35S) were made. The logic of R35K mutation was to see if the shorter side-chain of Lysine could allow recognition of m 6 A. We also made a mutation (S34Y) in the serine 34, which is frequently mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes ( Yoshida et al., 2011 93. Yoshida, K. ∙ Sanada, M. ∙ Shiraishi, Y. ... Frequent pathway mutations of splicing machinery in myelodysplasia Nature. 2011; 478 :64-69 Crossref Scopus (1302) PubMed Google Scholar ). The constructs used for recombinant protein production were verified by restriction digest, as well as by Sanger sequencing.
The worm METT-10 ORF was cloned into pACEBac2-His-StrepII-SUMO vector (Geneva Biotech) for expression in Sf21 or High Five (Hi5) insect cells as a 6xHis-StrepII-SUMO-tagged fusion. The constructs used for recombinant protein production were verified by restriction digest, as well as by Sanger sequencing. Expression construct for human METTL16 (hMETTL16) was previously reported ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Transgene reporter constructs were based on modified full-length C. elegans SAM synthetase gene sams-3 (Wormbase: CE03957). The whole sams-3 gene (2189 nt, including 5′ and 3′UTR sequences) was amplified using DH298 and DH299 primers, but to distinguish the transgene reporter constructs from the endogenous sams-3 transcript, 20 nt-long artificial sequences were placed into the exon2 (TGAACGACCGTGTTCTAGGG, DH300 and DH301) and exon3 (ACAGCCTACTTTGAGTGCGTA, DH302 and DH303), allowing for a specific PCR amplification ( Table S3 ). The inserted 20-nt artificial sequences also rendered the reporters non-coding, as they were designed to cause a frameshift in the protein coding sequence. In addition, the wild-type (WT) METT-10 methylation consensus motif (UAC AG AAAC) that overlaps the 3′ splice site AG was mutated (MUT) in the part of the consensus that belongs to the exon3 (UAC AG A CUU , mutation is underlined). The mutation was introduced using MM320 and MM321 primers, and by amplifying the whole plasmid ( Table S3 ). Such a mutation is demonstrated to prevent methylation by METT-10 in vitro ( Figure 3 B). Making the mutations on the exonic part is meant to reduce the disruption of binding sites for the key splicing factors. The constructs were cloned into the pUC19 plasmid for C. elegans expression under the his-72 promoter to ensure ubiquitous expression of the construct. The constructs were verified by restriction digest, as well as by Sanger sequencing.
Sams-3 full-length fragment was PCR-amplified from the pUC19-sams-3 plasmid prepared for worms injections, using MM415 and MM416 primers (Table S3). Forward primer introduced NotI restriction site, while reverse primer introduced NheI site. The amplified fragment was cloned into the mammalian expression vector phRL-TK (Promega), which was first digested with NotI-HF (NEB, cat. no. R3189S) and NheI-HF (NEB, cat. no. R3131S) restriction enzymes. This removes the whole luciferase (hRL) sequence. The phRL-|TK vector has the HSV Thymidine Kinase promoter, allowing low-level expression in mammalian cells. The final constructs used were verified by restriction digest, as well as by Sanger sequencing.
The polyclonal rabbit anti-m 6 A (Synaptic Systems; cat. no. 202003) for m 6 A-IP-seq, polyclonal rabbit anti-METTL16 (abcam; cat. no. ab186012) to detect mouse METTL16, polyclonal rabbit anti-PARK7 (Invitrogen, cat. no. PA5-13404) to detect mammalian PARK7 as a normalization control for western blots, anti-HA (a kind gift from Marc Bühler, clone #42F13) to detect HA-tag, anti-FLAG (Sigma, cat. no. F3165) to detect FLAG-tag, anti-TUBULIN (Abcam; cat. no. ab6160) to detect worm TUBULIN, and anti-H3 (Abcam; ab1791) to detect worm histone H3 were used. For secondary antibodies, the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked (GE Healthcare; cat. no. NA934), HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Superclonal Secondary Antibody (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. A27025) or HRP-conjugated anti-rat IgG (GE Healthcare, cat. no. NA935) were used.
Production of full-length recombinant proteins was carried out either in insect cell lines using the baculovirus expression system or in the prokaryotic expression system using E. coli .
The insect ovary-derived cell lines used are: High Five (Hi5) insect cell line originating from the cabbage looper ( Trichoplusia ni ) and the Sf9 cells derived from the fall army worm Spodoptera frugiperda . Briefly, recombinant full-length hMETTL16 ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) or worm METT-10 coding sequences were cloned into the pACEBac2-Sumo acceptor vector (His-Strep-Sumo tag) ( Bieniossek et al., 2012 8. Bieniossek, C. ∙ Imasaki, T. ∙ Takagi, Y. ... MultiBac: expanding the research toolbox for multiprotein complexes Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37 :49-57 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Plasmids were transformed into DH10EMBacY competent cells for recombination with the baculovirus genomic DNA (bacmid). The bacmid DNA was extracted and transfected with FuGENE HD (Promega, cat. no. E231A) into the Sf 9 insect cells for virus production. The supernatant (V 0 ) containing the recombinant baculovirus was collected after 72 to 96 hours post-transfection. To expand the virus pool, 6.0 mL of the V 0 virus stock was added into 25 mL of Sf 9 (0.5 × 10 6 /mL) cells. The resulting cell culture supernatant (V 1 ) was collected 24 h post-proliferation arrest. For large-scale expression of the protein, Hi5 cells were infected with virus (V 1 ) and cells were harvested 72 h post-proliferation arrest.
For bacterial expression, plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and expression was initiated by addition of 0.7 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the culture density reached 0.6 (OD 600 ). The proteins were then expressed overnight at 20°C following induction.
The U2AF heterodimer is formed by interactions between the large subunit U2AF65 and small subunit U2AF35 ( Zamore and Green, 1989 95. Zamore, P.D. ∙ Green, M.R. Identification, purification, and biochemical characterization of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :9243-9247 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). The U2AF65 has three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), while the U2AF35 has one RRM flanked by two CCCH-type zinc fingers (ZFs). Only a 28-amino acid fragment from U2AF65 is required for interaction with U2AF35 ( Kielkopf et al., 2001 38. Kielkopf, C.L. ∙ Rodionova, N.A. ∙ Green, M.R. ... A novel peptide recognition mode revealed by the X-ray structure of a core U2AF35/U2AF65 heterodimer Cell. 2001; 106 :595-605 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). A soluble S. pombe U2AF complex consisting of full-length U2AF35 and a larger region (93-161 aa) encompassing the 28-amino acid proline-rich fragment from U2AF65, was previously described ( Yoshida et al., 2015 94. Yoshida, H. ∙ Park, S.Y. ∙ Oda, T. ... A novel 3′ splice site recognition by the two zinc fingers in the U2AF small subunit Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :1649-1660 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). This complex is shown to specifically recognize the AG dinucleotide, as single mutations in the RNA at these positions either abolish or greatly reduce binding to the RNA ( Yoshida et al., 2015 94. Yoshida, H. ∙ Park, S.Y. ∙ Oda, T. ... A novel 3′ splice site recognition by the two zinc fingers in the U2AF small subunit Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :1649-1660 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, this complex does not bind a polypyrimidine stretch (U 10 ) ( Yoshida et al., 2015 94. Yoshida, H. ∙ Park, S.Y. ∙ Oda, T. ... A novel 3′ splice site recognition by the two zinc fingers in the U2AF small subunit Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :1649-1660 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ZFs in U2AF35 cooperatively bind the RNA ( Yoshida et al., 2015 94. Yoshida, H. ∙ Park, S.Y. ∙ Oda, T. ... A novel 3′ splice site recognition by the two zinc fingers in the U2AF small subunit Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :1649-1660 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We used this S. pombe U2AF complex (which has RNA-binding property only in U2AF35) for our studies, and for simplicity is referred to as full-length yeast U2AF35.
The ORFs for yU2AF35 and His-StrepII tag fused yU2AF65 (93-161 aa) were cloned into pETDuet-1 vector, and the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain for co-expression. The protein complex was expressed overnight at 20°C with 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% Glycerol, 20 mM Imidazole and proteinase inhibitor). The supernatant after centrifugation was subjected to Ni-NTA column and StrepTrap column for obtaining His-StrepII tagged protein complex. After removal of the tags by overnight TEV cleavage, the untagged protein complex was further purified by size exclusion column (Superdex S75) in buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl).
ITC experiments were performed (at EMBL Grenoble, France; kind help of Dr. Andrew McCarthy) using a MicroCal iTC 200 (Malvern Panalytical) at 20°C. The yeast U2AF35 protein, as well as RNAs, were dialyzed overnight in the buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl). The sample cell was filled with 50 μM of either unmethylated or m 6 A methylated RNA (CU A GG, methylated adenosine is underlined), and the syringe was filled with 500 μM yeast U2AF protein. Titrations were carried out with a first 0.4 μL injection followed by constant volume injections (19 injections of 2 μL) with 150 s spacing. Data analysis was performed using Origin software.
Worms were collected in TRIzol as described in the “Collection of C. elegans for the RNA isolation” section. To isolate RNA, worms were first kept in TRIzol at room temperature for 1 – 2 hours with frequent vortexing to ensure complete lysis. Then, samples were spun for 10 min. at 14000 x g at 4°C and supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes. Chloroform (Merck, cat. no. 102445) was added to TRIzol in 1 to 5 volume ratio and the tubes were first vortexed for 15 s. and then left at room temperature for 3 minutes. Next, the tubes were spun at 14000 x g for 15 min. at 4°C. The upper layer (aqueous phase) was transferred to fresh tubes and an equal amount of chloroform was added. The tubes were vortexed for 30 s. and spun at 14000 x g for 10 min. at 4°C. The upper layer (aqueous fraction) was transferred to fresh tubes, where 2.5 volume of 100% ethanol (VWR, cat. no. 20821.321) was added. The tubes were stored at −20°C for at least 1 hour to precipitate the RNA. After precipitation, the tubes were spun at 14000 x g for 30 min. at 4°C. The RNA pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol, dried at RT and resuspended in RNase-free water (Invitrogen, cat. no. 10977-05). The isolated RNA was stored at −80°C to avoid RNA degradation.
Worm poly(A) + RNA was purified using Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen, cat. no. 61006). All the step were performed accordingly to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 225 μg of RNA was diluted in RNase-free water to a final volume of 300 μl. RNA was then heated to 65°C for 3 minutes and placed on ice. At the same time, 600 μl of resuspended Dynabeads Oligo (dT) 25 beads were transferred to fresh tubes, which were placed on a magnetic stand. The supernatant was removed and 300 μl of Binding Buffer was added to equilibrate the beads. Tubes were again placed on a magnetic stand and supernatant was removed. Another 300 μl of Binding Buffer was added and the beads were mixed with the RNA (1:1 volume ratio). The RNA was incubated with the beads for 15 min. at RT with rocking. Then, tubes were placed at the magnetic stand and supernatant was removed. Beads were washed twice with 600 μl Washing Buffer B. Next, beads were resuspended in 40 μl of water, heated to 75°C for 2 minutes and immediately placed on ice. The supernatant with eluted mRNA was transferred into fresh tubes and stored at −80°C to avoid RNA degradation.
We followed the method described previously ( Liu et al., 2013 45. Liu, N. ∙ Parisien, M. ∙ Dai, Q. ... Probing N6-methyladenosine RNA modification status at single nucleotide resolution in mRNA and long noncoding RNA RNA. 2013; 19 :1848-1856 Crossref Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ) to produce the data presented in Figures 1 J and S1 H. The oligonucleotides used are provided in Table S3. In short, 1 μg of total RNA or mRNA, isolated as previously described, was mixed with 3 pmol of chimeric oligo in a total volume of 3 μl of 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. We tested different lengths (17/18 nt, 20 nt, 23 nt, 30 nt) of chimeric oligos for both U6 snRNA and sams-3 targets. Generally, the shortest chimeric oligos (18 nt) were performing the best, although in the case of U6 snRNA the difference wasn’t dramatic. On the other hand, in the case of the sams-3 target, there was a huge increase in cleavage efficiency from 20 nt to 18 nt chimeric oligo. Thus, we recommend using short chimeric oligos and testing different sizes.
The mix was heated for 1 min. at 95°C followed by incubation at room temperature for 3 min. before placing on ice. Then, 1 μl of 5x RNase H mix (2 x T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (NEB, cat. no. B0201S), 1 unit/μl of RNase H (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. EN0201)) and 1μl of FastAP (Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase, 1U/μl, Thermo Scientific, cat. no. EF0651) were added to the tube (total volume was 5 μl). Samples were incubated for 1 hour at 44°C and then heated for 5 min. to 75°C in order to inactivate RNase H and FastAP. Immediately after the heating, samples were placed on ice. We have tested multiple RNase H enzymes: NEB, cat. no. M0297S; Thermo Scientific, cat. no. EN0201; Sigma, cat. no. R6501; Invitrogen, cat. no. 18021014; Takara, cat. no. 2150A. Although all of them worked, RNase H from Thermo Scientific (cat. no. EN0201) and RNase H from Sigma (cat. no. R6501) seemed to be the most efficient in our hands. After the RNase H digest, the RNA was 5ʹ-end labeled with 32 P by adding 1 μl of 6 x T4 PNK mix (1 x T4 PNK buffer, 6 units/μL of T4 PNK (NEB, cat. no. M0201L) and 28 μCi/μL [γ- 32 P] ATP (PerkinElmer, NEG002A001MC)). The mix was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, then heated for 5 min. at 75°C in order to inactivate T4 PNK and immediately put on ice.
We took 1.5 μl mix of 4 pmol of splint oligo/5 pmol of ssDNA universal oligo (ssDNA-116/MM437) was added to the tubes. The mix was annealed by heating for 3 min. at 75°C and cooling down for 3 min. at room temperature, then it was put on ice. 2.5 μL of 4 x ligation mix (1.4x T4 PNK buffer, 0.27 mM ATP (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 27-2056-01), 57% DMSO (ThermoScientific, F-515), 80 U/μL T4 DNA ligase (NEB, M0202M)) was added and RNA was ligated for 3.5 hours at 37°C. The reaction was stopped with 2 x RNA loading buffer (9 M urea, 100 mM EDTA, xylene and bromophenol dye) and 1 μL of RNase T1/A mix (160 U/μL RNase T1 (ThermoScientific, cat. no. EN0541) and 0.16 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma, cat. no. R6513-10MG)) was added. The RNA was incubated overnight at 37°C. Next, it was run on 10% Urea-PAGE gel together with a 32 P labeled ssDNA universal oligo (ssDNA-116/MM437) used as a marker. The band corresponding to 117-/118-bp was cut out of the gel. RNA was eluted from the gel for 4 h at 25°C with 750 rpm shaking using RNA extraction buffer (300 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS). Supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and RNA was isolated with phenol/chloroform. RNA pellet was then resuspended in 3 μl of Nuclease P mix (0.33 U/μL of Nuclease P1 (Sigma, cat. no. N8630) in 30 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C.
After digestion, 1 μL of digested RNA was transferred into TLC PEI Cellulose F plate (Merck, cat. no. 1055790001) and was resolved for 14 h in a mix of isopropanol:HCl:water (70:15:15, v/v/v). After that, the TLC plate was dried at RT for 30 – 60 min., wrapped in a plastic film and exposed to a phosphor screen BAS IP MS 2025 E (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 28956475). Phosphor screen was scanned in a Typhoon FLA 9500 laser scanner (GE Healthcare) at 700V and 100 μm pixel size.
The total RNA was isolated from various sources: WT worms grown on various food sources, or transgenic worms with WT or MUT transgene reporter constructs or HeLa cells expressing worm reporter constructs. The RNA was reverse transcribed using Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA (Thermo Fisher, K1682) with random primers. The cDNA was diluted to 50 μl, and of this a 2 μl aliquot was used for PCR. Primers used for the PCR were MM395 and MM396 in the case of endogenous sams- 3 transcript or MM363 and MM364 in the case of transgene reporter constructs construct ( Table S3 ). Transgene reporter constructs PCR amplification (MM363, MM364) generates three bands: intron-retained transcript (517 bp), alternatively spliced transcript (239 bp) and fully spliced isoform (148 bp), while for the endogenous sams-3 transcript PCR generates: intron-retained transcript (502 bp), alternatively spliced transcript (225 bp) and fully spliced isoform (133 bp). The PCR products were resolved in a 2% agarose gel ( Figures 3 D, S3 A, 5 A, S4 C, and S5 B), stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light in a gel visualization system (Vilber Lourmat E-Box VX2). Gel pictures were analyzed using Fiji software package ( Schindelin et al., 2012 69. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (21356) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intensity of each transcript isoform was calculated using the gel analyzer function. It was then normalized to the total intensity of all the transcript isoforms within one sample, allowing for internal normalization and comparison of different samples. Results obtained by RT-PCR quantification of worms grown on different food sources are in agreement with RNA-seq quantification.
Total RNA was isolated by Trizol extraction from adult C. elegans (worm), the Bombyx mori (Silkmoth) BmN4 cell line (insect) and adult mouse testes (mouse), as indicated in Figure 1 B. These RNAs were also used to purify poly(A) + RNA. The RNAs were hydrolyzed to ribonucleosides by 20 U Benzonase® Nuclease (Santa Cruz Biotech, cat. no. sc-202391) and 0.2 U Nuclease P1 (Sigma, cat. no. N8630-1VL) in 10 mM ammonium acetate pH 6.0 and 1 mM magnesium chloride at 40°C for 1 h. After that, ammonium bicarbonate to 50 mM, 0.002 U phosphodiesterase I and 0.1 U alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) were added, and incubated further at 37°C for 1 h. The hydrolysates were mixed with 3 volumes of acetonitrile and centrifuged (16,000 x g, 30 min, 4°C). The supernatants were dried and dissolved in 50 μL water for LC-MS/MS analysis of modified and unmodified ribonucleosides. Chromatographic separation was performed using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system with an ZORBAX RRHD Eclipse Plus C18 150 × 2.1 mm ID (1.8 μm) column protected with an ZORBAX RRHD Eclipse Plus C18 5 × 2.1 mm ID (1.8 μm) guard column (Agilent). The mobile phase consisted of water and methanol (both added 0.1% formic acid) run at 0.23 mL/min. For modifications, starting with 5% methanol for 0.5 min followed by a 2.5 min gradient of 5%–15% methanol, a 3 min gradient of 15%–95% methanol and 4 min re-equilibration with 5% methanol. A portion of each sample was diluted for the analysis of unmodified ribonucleosides which was chromatographed isocratically with 20% methanol. Mass spectrometric detection was performed using an Agilent 6495 Triple Quadrupole system, monitoring the mass transitions 268.1-136.1 (A), 284.1-152.1 (G), 244.1-112.1 (C), 245.1-113.1 (U), 296.1-150.1 (m 6 Am), 282.1-150.1 (m 6 A and m 1 A), 282.1-136.1 (Am), 296.1-164.1 (m 6 2 A), 283.1-151.1 (m 1 I), 298.1-166.1 (m 7 G), 312.1-180.1 (m 2,7 G), 326.1-194.1 (m 2,2,7 G), 258.1-126.1 (m 3 C and m 5 C), 274.1-142.1 (hm 5 C), 286.1-154.1 (ac 4 C), 259.1-139.1 (m1Ψ), 333.1-201.1 (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine, mcm5s2U), and 333.1-183.1 (( S )- and ( R )-5-methoxycarbonylhydroxymethyluridine, S-mchm5U and R-mchm5U) in positive electrospray ionization mode, and 267.1-135.1 (inosine, I) and 243.1-153.1 (pseudouridine, Ψ) in negative electrospray ionization mode. Modifications detected in a mock control (containing only the hydrolytic enzymes) were subtracted from modifications detected in the RNA samples. In general, the mock control contained at least 1000-fold less RNA than the RNA samples and gave negligible background in the modification analyses.
Approximately, 3-4 L4 hermaphrodite worms were placed on 6 cm plates containing either nutrient-low media (NGM medium and seeded with OP50 bacteria) or nutrient-high media (peptone-rich medium and seeded with NA22 bacteria) (Table S4). After around 5 days of incubation at 20°C, when the progeny reached adult stage, the worms were washed off the plates with PBS, washed 2 more times with PBS and once with water. The excess of the liquid was discarded and packed worm pellet was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Then we shipped the lysates in dry ice to the Metabolomics Platform, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Analysis was conducted as previously described for polyamines concentration measurement ( Chevalier et al., 2020 14. Chevalier, C. ∙ Kieser, S. ∙ Çolakoğlu, M. ... Warmth prevents bone loss through the gut microbiota Cell Metab. 2020; 32 :575-590.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Methylation assays were carried using chemically synthetized RNA oligos (IDT, Belgium or Microsynth, Switzerland) ( Table S3 ). Recombinant untagged full-length human METTL16 or full-length C. elegans METT-10 were used ( Figure 3 B).
Before the experiment, RNA was refolded by heating the 100 μM RNA solution in H 2 O or 50 mM NaCl to 65°C in a Thermoblock (Eppendorf) for 5 min, and allowed to slowly cool down to the room temperature. All methylation reactions were performed in a 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT buffer with 10 μM of refolded single-stranded RNA, 5 μg of recombinant protein, 1 μl of RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. EO0381) and 0.02 μCi of 14 C-SAM (Perkin Elmer, NEC363010UC) in a total volume of 20 μl. Unless otherwise indicated, all reactions were performed overnight at room temperature. RNA was subsequently extracted using phenol/chloroform extraction protocol, resuspended in 15 μl of 2x RNA loading buffer (90% formamide, 0.02% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% bromophenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol), heated for 5 min. at 70°C, cooled down to room temperature and loaded on a 15% Urea-PAGE gel.
The 15% Urea-PAGE gel was prepared by mixing 12.6 g of urea, 3 mL of 10x TBE (1 M Tris base, 1 M boric acid, 0.02 M EDTA), 11.25 mL of 40% acrylamide (19:1) and 6.75 mL of H2O. To catalyze gel polymerization, 240 μl of APS and 24 μl of TEMED (Merck, cat. no. 1107320100) were added. Gel was left to polymerize for 40 min. at room temperature. Wells were washed with 1xTBE to remove urea deposits and gel was pre-run in 1x TBE at 20 W for 25 min. RNA markers 5ʹ end-labeled with 32 P-γ-ATP and composed of four single-stranded RNA oligos (RP_RNA_19: 40 nt, RP_RNA_1: 30 nt, RP_RNA_3: 28 nt, RP_RNA_18: 16 nt; Table S3 ) were loaded into the gel, together with 10 μl of RNA samples from the in vitro methylation assay. Gel was run at 12 W for 1 h 30 min.
After running, to visualize RNA bands, the gel was stained with a methylene blue solution [0.2% (w/v) methylene blue in a 1:1 solution of 0.4M sodium acetate and 0.4M acetic acid] for 10 min. This staining can be done by carefully sealing the gel in a plastic bag and shaking it on a rocking platform/frequently mixing the contents. Next, the gel was destained with 1xTBE and scanned using Epson Perfection 3200 Photo scanner. The destaining is also done by removing the staining solution, injecting the wash buffer into the bag and carefully mixing the contents. After scanning, the gel was dried in a gel dryer (Bio-Rad, model 583) with a gradual heating program, 80°C for 1.5 h. The dried gel was transferred to a cassette and exposed with a phosphor screen BAS (GE Healthcare) for 24 h. The phosphor screen was scanned in a Typhoon FLA 9500 laser scanner (GE Healthcare) at 700V and at 100 μm pixel size. Control software used for Typhoon FLA 9500 is the 1.1 version. Scans were analyzed using ImageQuant TL 8.1 software (GE Healthcare).
Both the human β-globin and adenovirus-based MINX splicing constructs were prepared by splint ligation ( Moore and Sharp, 1992 56. Moore, M.J. ∙ Sharp, P.A. Site-specific modification of pre-mRNA: the 2′-hydroxyl groups at the splice sites Science. 1992; 256 :992-997 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) of two RNA fragments. A longer T7 transcribed 5′ fragment that has 5′ exon and most of the intron, while a shorter 3′ synthetic RNA fragment (IDT, Belgium) that has the 3′ splice site and the 3′ exon. This allows introduction of either a methylated or unmethylated adenosine at the splice site by chemical synthesis.
To obtain the 5′ RNA fragment, both the β-globin and MINX DNA fragments were amplified by PCR. Forward primers contained T7 promoter sequence, while reverse primers contained 2ʹ- O -methyl residues at the last two nucleotides to prevent non-template nucleotide addition by the T7 polymerase. In addition, the MINX construct was mutated in order to create a version with a weaker polypyrimidine tract. The mutation was introduced by using a modified reverse primer (MM583) for the PCR reaction (Table S3). The PCR fragments were purified and used for T7 transcription with an m 7 G cap analog (m 7 G(5)ppp(5)G, NEB, Cat. No. S1404S) used in 4:1 ratio to GTP. Using m 7 G analog is essential as only capped transcripts are efficiently spliced. After the in vitro transcription, RNA was first purified with MicroSpin G-25 size exclusion columns (GE Healthcare, cat. no. 27-5325-01), and then it was extracted with phenol/chloroform.
The 3′ synthetic fragments without methylation, or with m 6 A at the 3′ splice site, or with m 6 A within the 3′ exon were purchased (IDT, Table S3). 50 pmol of the T7 transcribed RNA and 50 pmol of the synthetic RNA were mixed with 50 pmol of an antisense DNA oligo splint (that has extensive complementarity to the two RNA ends that need to be joined) in a total volume of 15 μl of an annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The mix was heated in a thermocycler to 90°C and cooled down to 25°C (a program with gradual cooling at −0.1°C/second was used). Next, the RNA-DNA hybrid was incubated with 6μl of T4 DNA ligase mix (1x T4 ligase buffer, 1 μl of high-concentration T4 DNA ligase (2,000U/μl; NEB, cat.no. M0202M), 1 μl of RiboLock RNase Inhibitor, 2 μl PEG8000 (50%)) for 4 h at 37°C. The reaction was subsequently purified with phenol/chloroform and resuspended in 10 μl of H 2 O.
Approximately, 1 – 2 μl of ligated RNA was used for 3′ end labeling reaction, where it was mixed with 13 – 14 μl of pCp ligation mix(1 x T4 RNA Ligase 1 reation buffer, 1 mM ATP, 10% DMSO, 1 μl of T4 RNA Ligase 1 (NEB, cat.no. M0204), 1 μl of 32 P-labeled cytidine 3′, 5′ bis(phosphate) (pCp, PerkinElmer, cat.no. NEG019A250UC), 1 μl of RiboLock RNase Inhibitor and water) and incubated overnight at 4°C. This reaction was then loaded on a 5% Urea-PAGE gel and the band corresponding to ∼200 nt ligated RNA was cut out, eluted and resuspended in 20 – 30 μl of H 2 O. This gives a splicing pre-mRNA substrate that is protected at the 5′ end with an m 7 G cap and radioactively marked at the 3′ end with 32 P-labeled pCp.
Splicing extracts were prepared as described before ( Lee et al., 1988 42. Lee, K.A. ∙ Bindereif, A. ∙ Green, M.R. A small-scale procedure for preparation of nuclear extracts that support efficient transcription and pre-mRNA splicing Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5 :22-31 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ) using HeLa S3 cells. The cells were maintained at the concentration of 200 000 – 500 000 cells/mL and prior to collection were expanded to 600 000 – 800 000 cells/mL. It is important to harvest cells at the logarythimc growth stage. 400 mL of HeLa S3 suspension culture was collected (1200 x g, 5 min, 4°C), washed twice with 1xPBS and spun down (1200 x g, 5 min, 4°C) to assess packed cell volume (PCV). 300 mL of cell culture resulted in approximately 1 mL of PCV. All subsequent steps were performed on ice in a cold room (4°C). All buffers (placed in an ice bucket), pipette tips, Eppendorf tubes, etc. were pre-chilled in the cold room before use. Cells were gently resuspended in buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT) in a volume equal to PCV. After 15 min. cells were passed 6-times through a 23 gauge syringe (vigorous passage) and centrifuged at 12 000 x g for 20 s. at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer C (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT) in the volume of 2/3 rd of PCV. Resuspended nuclear pellet was mixed on a tube revolver (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 88881002) with 15 rpm speed for 30 min. at 4°C. N ext, it was spun down at 12 000 x g for 5 min. at 4°C. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and spun again (12 000 x g for 5 min. at 4°C), while the remaining pellet was removed. Supernatant (nuclear extract) was dialyzed twice for 2 hours in 100-times the volume of extract in buffer D (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT). Protease inhibitor PMSF was always added fresh, just before using the buffers. Extracts were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Quality of the lysates was verified by retrieving a frozen aliquot for use in a splicing assay.
In vitro splicing reaction was done as described previously ( Mayeda and Krainer, 1999 50. Mayeda, A. ∙ Krainer, A.R. Mammalian in vitro splicing assays Haynes, S.R. (Editor) RNA-Protein Interaction Protocols Springer, 1999; 315-321 Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar ) In short, 15 μl of nuclear extract was mixed on ice with 10 μl of a mix containing the RNA substrate [1 μl of RNA, 1.25 mM ATP, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 8 mM MgCl2, 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 6.5% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)] and incubated at 30°C for 0, 1 and 2 hours (for β-globin substrate) or 0, 15, 30 and 60 min. (for MINX substrate). At each time point, the reaction was stopped by adding 180 μl of splicing stop solution [0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 62.5 μg/mL tRNA (Sigma, cat. no. R-9001)] and kept at 4°C until all samples were ready. RNA was extracted with equal volume of water-saturated phenol (AppliChem; cat.no. A1624) and centrifuged for 10 min. at 12 000 x g at 4°C. Do not use chloroform at any point of the RNA extraction as it forms a very large interphase with PVA. After centrifugation, supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and 1 μl of RNA grade glycogen (20 μg/μL, Thermo Scientific, cat.no. R0551) as well as 100% ethanol (2.5x the volume of supernatant) was added and RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at −20°C. The tubes were centrifuged at 14’000 x g for 30 min. at 4°C and RNA was resuspended in 15 μl of 2x RNA loading buffer (90% formamide, 0.02% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% bromophenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol). 10 μl was loaded on 8% Urea-PAGE gel and run at 12W for 1 hour. 32 P-labeled RiboRuler Low Range RNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. SM1831) was loaded as a molecular-weight size marker. Gel was dried and exposed with phosphor screen BAS (GE Healthcare). The phosphor screen was scanned in a Typhoon FLA 9500 laser scanner (GE Healthcare) at 700V and 100 μm pixel size.
Adult males (post-natal day 60, P60) were euthanized using CO2 and testes were isolated. Pictures of freshly isolated testes were taken with SteREO Discovery V12 (Zeiss) ( Figure 6 C). To prepare the paraffin sections, isolated testes were fixed in Bouin’s solution (Sigma, cat. no. HT10132) for 48h at 4°C. Next, testes were washed in PBS for 48 h at 4°C, with frequent PBS changes. Samples were transferred into the embedding cassettes (Simport; cat. no. M508-3) and sent to the histology platform of University of Geneva. The samples were dehydrated in 70% (2 × 2h), 90% (1h), 95% (1h) and 100% ethanol (3 × 30 min) followed by incubation (3 times for 30 min) in HistoSAV2 (Biosystems). The solution was removed, replaced with paraffin, and incubated at 56-58°C. Testes were then transferred into plastic molds (Peel-A-Way® Embedding Mold S22, Polysciences, ; cat. no. 18646A-1) filled with paraffin and left at room temperature for paraffin to solidify. The sections (5 μm thickness) were cut using microtome (Leica RM2135) and mounted on the Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Thermo Fisher; cat no. 4951PLUS4). The sections were allowed to stretch for 24 h at 42°C and then were stored at room temperature.
Next, sections were stained using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain protocol. The slides containing the paraffin sections were placed in a glass slide holder filled with HistoSAV2 (3 × 5 min) to remove the paraffin. For rehydration, the slides were incubated in 3x 100% ethanol, 96% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 50% ethanol and water (3 min for each step). Sections were stained with Hematoxylin solution (Merck) for 3-5 min and rinsed in running tap water. Then, sections were stained with Eosin Y solution (Sigma Aldrich; cat. no. E4382) for 3 to 5 min and washed with water. For dehydration, the sections were incubated in 50% (30 s), 70% (30 s), 96% (30 s), 100% ethanol (2 min) and HistoSAV (3 × 3 min). Neo-Mount (Merck) was put on the sections and immediately covered with coverslips. Pictures were taken using microscope AXIO Imager M2 (Zeiss).
Adult (P60) wild-type C57BL/6J male and female were euthanized using CO2 and various different tissues were isolated. Tissues were washed with PBS and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For lysate preparation, a piece the frozen tissue was cut out on a metal block placed on dry ice. The tissue piece was homogenized in 1 mL lysis buffer [50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM DTT, Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche, Cat. No. 5056489001)]. The lysate was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, centrifuged at 14000 x g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was measured using the detergent-compatible colorimetric assay using a kit DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, 5000112). The reaction is similar to Lowry assay. The lysate concentration was normalized to 1 mg/mL using lysis buffer. Protein extracts were stored at −80°C.
Worms from three 6 cm plates containing synchronized adult population were washed off with M9 buffer. Worm pellets were washed additional 2 times, the excess of liquid was discarded and packed worm pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl-1mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% CHAPS, PMSF), 3x the volume of the worm pellet. The samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. To obtain worm lysates, the samples were sonicated (10x 30 s ON, and 30 s OFF) with occasional snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen to break the worm cuticle. The lysates were clarified (20min spin 21’000 g at 4°C) and supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes. Protein concentration was measured immidiatelly after the protein extraction, using DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, 5000112). Protein lysate was mixed with 5X Laemmli Sample Buffer and water to a final concentration of μg/μl protein, boiled for 5 minutes at 95°C and frozen. Samples were stored at −80°C prior to the analysis.
Mouse whole tissue lysates (30 μg/well) or worm lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE gels prepared using Ultra-Pure ProtoGel 30% acrylamide (37.5:1) (National Diagnostic; cat. no. EC-890) mixed with ultra-pure water and resolving gel buffer, to obtain 12% resolving gel (0.375 M Tris, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.8), or with stacking gel buffer to obtain 8% stacking gel (0.125 M Tris, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.8). N,N,N’,N’-Tetramethylethylendiamin (Merck, cat. no. 1107320100). The gel was polymerized by addition of 10% ammonium persulfate (AppliChem, cat.no. A1142). Gel electrophoresis was performed at 90 V for 30 min. and then at 120 V for 90 min. After separation, proteins were blotted on the Amersham Protran 0.45 mm nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare; cat. no. 10600002) overnight at 5 V at room temperature using Trans-Blot SD. Semi-Dry Transfer Cell system (Bio-Rad; cat. no. 1703940). After transfer, membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) and blocked for 30 min. at room temperature with 5% dry milk in TBS with 0.05% Tween20 (TTBS) (SIGMA; cat. no. P7949). After 30 min. membranes were incubated with primary antibody: 1:500 anti-METTL16 (abcam; ab186012) or 1:100 anti-PARK7 (Invitrogen, PA5-13404) for 1 h at RT in 5% milk with TTBS. Membranes were then washed 5 times for 5 minutes with TTBS and incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked (GE Healthcare; NA934) secondary antibody at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at RT in 5% milk in TTBS. After 1 h, membranes were washed 5 times for 5 minutes with TTBS followed by 3 washes for 5 minutes with TBS and incubated with one of the detection reagents: Amersham Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare; RPN2232), SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher; cat. no. 34095) or Pierce ECL 2 Substrate (Thermo Fisher; cat. no. 1896433A) for 5 min. at room temperature. The chemiluminiscence signal was detected using Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare; cat. no. 28906837). The processed films were scanned using Perfection 3200 Photo scanner (Epson) with XSane image scanning software (ver. 0999).
To compare the extent of m 6 A RNA methylation between the species and map their location in the respective transcriptomes, we carried out m 6 A-IP-seq using pre-mixed RNAs from the different organisms. To this end, total or poly(A) + RNA was isolated from the adult worm ( C. elegans ) grown on nutrient-high media (peptone-rich media+ NA22 E. coli strain, Table S4), adult mouse testis (P30) and Silkworm ( Bombyx mori ) BmN4-SID1 insect cell line. The RNAs were pre-mixed before further processing for RNA fragmentation and m 6 A-IP-seq. In this mixed sample, the mouse RNA serves as an internal control for efficient m 6 A immunoprecipitation via the unambiguous detection of m 6 A peaks that are already reported ( Dominissini et al., 2012 18. Dominissini, D. ∙ Moshitch-Moshkovitz, S. ∙ Schwartz, S. ...

Poly(A) + transcripts were purified from 75 μg of total RNA using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Life Technologies; cat. no 61006). For total RNA fragmentation, 5 μg of total RNA each from mouse testis, adult worms and BmN4-SID1 cells was mixed with 2 μl of fragmentation reagent (AM8740, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a final volume of 20 μl in a PCR tube. The reaction mix was incubated at 75°C for 12 minutes in a PCR machine. The tube was then transferred on ice immediately, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2.2 μl of stop solution provided with fragmentation reagent. Similarly, for poly(A) + RNA fragmentation, 2 μg of poly(A) + selected RNA each from mouse testis, adult worms and BmN4-SID1 was fragmented with fragmentation reagent as above. Denaturing urea-PAGE confirmed that majority of the RNA fragments were in the size range of 20-80 nts. A small portion (10%) of fragmented RNA from each sample was kept aside as input, while the remainder was subjected to immunoprecipitation.
The m 6 A immunoprecipitation was performed as described ( Ke et al., 2015 37. Ke, S. ∙ Alemu, E.A. ∙ Mertens, C. ... A majority of m6A residues are in the last exons, allowing the potential for 3′ UTR regulation Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :2037-2053 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Protein A Dynabeads were washed once in PXL buffer (1 × PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40) followed by pre-treatment with BSA (final concentration 1 μg/ μL) in 200 μL PXL buffer for 45 minutes at RT. BSA pre-treated beads was then conjugated with m 6 A rabbit polyclonal antibody (20 μg; Synaptic Systems, catalog no. 202003) in 200 mL PXL buffer supplemented with 4 mL of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega; N2611) for one hour at RT on a rotating wheel. Dynabeads were further washed twice with PXL buffer, and finally, beads were resuspended in 400 mL of PXL buffer and 5 mL of RNasin. Fragmented RNA was added to the beads and incubated 4°C for 2 hours on a rotating wheel. After two hours incubation, the beads were washed twice by ice-cold Nelson low-salt buffer (15 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA), once by ice-cold Nelson high-salt buffer (15 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 M NaCl), once by ice-cold Nelson stringent wash buffer (15 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl), and last by ice-cold NT-2 buffer (50 mM Tris at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP-40). Antibody bound RNAs were eluted by incubating the beads with 0.5 mg/mL N 6 -methyl adenosine (Sigma-Aldrich; M2780) in NT2 buffer for one hour at 4°C. The eluted RNAs were precipitated with ethanol and glycogen and dissolved in RNase-free water. The input and IP RNAs were first 3ʹ end dephosphorylated with T4 PNK (NEB; M0201S, 10 U/mL) in the absence of ATP at 37°C for 45 minutes (40 mL reaction: 35.5 mL RNA, 4 mL 10X T4 PNK buffer, 0.5 mL of T4 PNK) followed by phosphorylation of 5ʹ end (50 mL reaction: 40 mL dephosphorylated RNA, 6.5 mL water, 1 mL RNasin, 0.5 mL 100 mM ATP, 1 mL 10X T4 PNK buffer 1 mL T4 PNK) at 37°C for 45 minutes. RNAs were phenol chloroform-extracted, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 6 mL of RNase free water. The input RNA fragments and the immunopurified RNAs after the phosphorylation step were directly used for strand-specific library preparation (barcoded at 3′ end) using NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (NEB; catalog No. E7560L) following manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were resolved on 3% high-resolution MethaPhor agarose (Lonza; catalog. No. 50180) gels in 1X TAE buffer at 70 V. Fragments in the size-range of ∼150-250 bp were gel-extracted with the use of MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN; cat No. 28604). Multiple libraries with different barcodes (at 3′ end) were mixed in equimolar ratios and sequenced with the NextSeq Illumina® Platform (EMBL Gene Core facility, Heidelberg). The maximum sequencing length was 75 nucleotides. The list of sequencing libraries generated is provided in Table S1 .
For identification of m 6 A targets of METT-10 ( Figures 1 F and 1G), total RNA from biological triplicates of adult wild-type and mett-10 KO worms, grown on nutrient-high media ( Table S4 ), was isolated using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. Poly(A) + transcripts were purified from 75 μg of total RNA using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Life Technologies; cat. no 61006). The RNA fragmentation and m 6 A-IP-seq protocol, as described above, was followed for total RNA from WT, and poly(A) + RNA from both WT and KO (in biological triplicates). For comparison between WT and the mett-10 KO was made under different diet conditions ( Figure 4 B), the animals were fed on either nutrient-high or nutrient-low media ( Table S4 ). Triplicate biological replicates were processed for m 6 A-IP-seq using poly(A) + RNA. Library preparation was as described above.
All statistical methods are indicated in the figure legends.
The reads were sorted into individual libraries based on the barcodes and clipped using cutadapt (parameters: -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT -m 15 -e 0.2 -O 4 -q 10–match-read-wildcards). The clipped reads were aligned to the mouse (GRCm38 – Ensembl release 95) or worm (WBcel235 – Ensembl release 95) genome using STAR (parameters:–outFilterType BySJout–limitOutSJcollapsed 50000000–limitIObufferSize 1500000000). Bombyx m 6 A distribution was not analyzed. We detected similar ratio of m 6 A/input reads for both species ( Figure S1 B). The m 6 A peak calling was done separately for reads mapped to mouse or worm genome using MACS2 (macs2 callpeak -f BAM -q 0.01–nomodel–extsize 50–call-summits). Consensus peaks from the biological replicates were identified using MSPC (parameters: -r bio -w 1e-4 -s 1e-8). Unlike in the mouse, only very low number of m 6 A peaks was identified in the worm. Peaks were annotated based on their overlap with the annotated features described in Ensembl gtf files ( Figures S1 C and S1D) and the enriched motifs were searched using MEME (parameters: -brief 50000 -nmotifs 5 -dna -revcomp -mod zoops -oc). Top motif is shown in Figures 1 D and S1 E. To investigate the m 6 A distribution along the individual transcripts, the adaptor trimmed reads from poly(A) + libraries were mapped to individual ENSEMBL mRNAs using bowtie (parameters: -v 0 -a–best –strata). The read counts were divided by number of transcripts they mapped to and coverage was calculated using IRanges::coverage function along the transcripts. We focused only on transcripts from genes which showed significant (adjusted p value ≤ 0.1) increase in m 6 A/input ratio. These were identified using mapping the reads using SALMON (parameters: -l A -p 10–gcBias–validateMappings) followed by DESeq2 analysis. For the transcripts of these genes metaplots were created comparing the coverage along the 5′ UTRs, CDS and 3′ UTRs longer than 100 nt. Each part was divided into 100 pieces for which the mean coverage was calculated. In the mouse we observed expected m 6 A enrichment at the start of 5′ UTRs (due to m 6 Am) and at the end of CDS ( Figure 1 E). The worm distribution was rather uniform. The mean m 6 A enrichment was also plotted for 0.5 kb vicinity of the STOP codon, which also showed m 6 A enrichment only for the mouse.
The reads were sorted into individual libraries based on the barcodes and clipped using cutadapt (parameters: -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT -m 15 -e 0.2 -O 4 -q 10–match-read-wildcards). The clipped reads were aligned to worm transcripts (WBcel235 – Ensembl release 95) using bowtie (parameters: -v 0 -a -k 10–allow-contain). The read counts were divided by number of transcripts they mapped to and the counts were summarized to gene levels. To find the genes whose transcripts lose m 6 A methylation in the absence of METT-10 we looked for genes with significant (padj ≤ 0.1) decrease of m 6 A-IP/input ratio in mett-10 KO using DESeq2 likelihood ratio test (LRT) where we compared the full model (∼input_or_m 6 A_IP + genotype + input_or_m 6 A_IP:genotype) to the reduced model (∼input_or_m 6 A_IP + genotype) ( Figure 1 G). We identified the transcripts of U6 snRNA genes and three highly similar SAM-synthetase genes ( sams-3 , sams-4 , sams-5 ) as the main targets of METT-10. To identify the precise adenosine which is methylated in U6 snRNA transcripts, we mapped the reads to the worm consensus sequence of U6 snRNA ( Figure S1 G), which was obtained by BLAST of mouse Rnu6 to worm genome, using bowtie (parameters: -v 0 -a -k 10–allow-contain) and plotted the normalized (reads per million - rpm) coverage which confirmed that the worm METT-10 recognizes the same motif as the human METTL16. The methylation was completely gone in the mett-10 KO ( Figure 1 I). Plotting the read counts normalized to library sizes (rpm) showed that although the U6 snRNAs are not polyadenylated we still were able to obtain enough reads in the poly(A) + libraries – but less than in the total RNA library from WT ( Figures 1 H and S1 I). Comparison of normalized (rpm) read counts in input samples discovered a bit higher U6 snRNA levels in the KO ( Figure S1 H). To find out whether the loss of U6 snRNA m 6 A methylation in the KO affects general splicing, we aligned the reads to the genome (WBcel235 – Ensembl release 95) using STAR (parametres:–outFilterType BySJout –limitBAMsortRAM = 40000000000–outSAMattributes All) and used the STAR generated SJ.out.tab files to count the reads spanning the annotated and novel splice junctions. The read counts were normalized to library sizes (rpm). We did not observe any decrease in the input KO samples which would suggest the negative impact on splicing ( Figure S1 J).
Investigation of normalized (rpm) m 6 A coverage along SAM synthetase genes ( sams-3, sams-4, sams-5 ), which showed decreased m 6 A/input ratio in the KO, revealed the m 6 A peak in the WT which overlaps the exon-intron boundary and is completely gone in the mett-10 KO ( Figure S2 A). Comparison of DESeq2 normalized read counts in input samples showed increased expression of these genes ( Figures S1 E and S2 C). Stronger WT m 6 A signal with clear peak summit was obtained from sams-3 and sams-4 which harbor identical sequence in this region. We used bowtie to align the reads specifically to this consensus sequence and plotted the normalized (rpm) coverage ( Figure 2 A), which identified the adenosine of the 3′ splice site to be methylated in the WT. Interestingly, when changing the plates on which the worms were grown from NA22 plates to OP50 plates, the methylation in the WT was strikingly decreased which was apparent from both the coverage along the exon-intron boundary and also the amount of reads mapping to the boundary ( Figures 4 B and S4 A).
To visualize the read coverages along selected genomic loci, we calculated thee normalized read coverages (rpm) of STAR mapped reads for individual samples. Plotting of the normalized read coverage (rpm) of input samples along the mett-10 locus demonstrated the loss of reads from the 5′ portion of mett-10 in the KO ( Figure S1 F).
To investigate the effect of m 6 A loss on sams-3 expression we plotted the mean coverage of its exons and introns from individual input samples ( Figure 2 B). This showed the general increased coverage of the exons in the KO, together with decreased coverage of intron 2 which contains the 3′ splice site methylated in the WT. To specifically compare the individual isoforms of sams-3 : canonically spliced protein coding (PC), alternatively spliced non-coding (AS) and non-coding intron retained isoform (IR), following criteria were used. The PC abundance was estimated based on spliced read counts spanning the second intron (chrIV: 5848949-5849317), AS isoform was quantified based on the counts of spliced reads spanning alternative intron (chrIV: 5848949-5849224) and the IR variant abundance was calculated as mean coverage of the canonical intron minus 10 nucleotides from both sites. All counts were normalized to library sizes (rpm) ( Figures 2 C and S4 B). Deep sequencing data generated during the study ( Table S1 ) are deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: GSE146873 ).
From 403563 annotated mouse 3′ splice sites in the ENSEMBL database, 916 were found to overlap with one of the METTL16 methylation motifs (UAC m 6 AG AGA or UAC m 6 AG AAA). Next, we extracted a 41 nt sequence centered around the target adenosine and predicted the secondary structure taken by the sequences using RNAfold. We then ranked the sequences based on the similarity of their predicted structures to that taken up by the bonafide METTL16/METT-10 target hairpin in the worm sams-3 (same sequence as in RNA-1 in Table S3 ). The similarity score was calculated as a sum of nucleotide positions represented as “(” or “)” in the dot-bracket notation of the secondary structure in both test sequences and in RNA-1 sequence. Several of the top-ranked sequences were used for in vitro methylation assay with recombinant human METTL16 ( Figures 6 E and 6F).
To see whether any of the METTL16 motif-containing 3′ splice sites display increased usage in Mettl16 −/− mice, pointing toward their methylation dependent regulation, we searched our dataset (GEO: GSE116329 ) of E2.5 and E3.5 embryos ( Mendel et al., 2018 51. Mendel, M. ∙ Chen, K.M. ∙ Homolka, D. ... Methylation of Structured RNA by the m 6 A Writer METTL16 Is Essential for Mouse Embryonic Development Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :986-1000.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). We normalized the counts of splice junction reads spliced at the 3′ splice sites to gene expression levels, and searched for those 3′ splice sites with increased relative usage in Mettl16 −/− . Two such sites with increased usage in E3.5 embryos were identified which localize to chr17:84777132-84777139 (in Lrpprc gene) and chr19:40350011-40350018 (in Sorbs1 gene) ( Figure 6 G).
