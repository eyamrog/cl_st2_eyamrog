Title: Imbalance of Regulatory and Cytotoxic SARS-CoV-2-Reactive CD4 + T Cells in COVID-19


Abstract: Summary

The contribution of CD4 + T cells to protective or pathogenic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Here, we present single-cell transcriptomic analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4 + T cells from 40 COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T helper (T H ) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (T REG ). Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic T FH response was observed early in the illness, which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional T H 1 and T H 17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4 + T cells. Together, our analyses provide insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells in distinct disease severities.

Section: Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing substantial mortality, morbidity, and societal disruption ( Tay et al., 2020 46. Tay, M.Z. ∙ Poh, C.M. ∙ Rénia, L. ... The trinity of COVID-19: immunity, inflammation and intervention Nat Rev Immunol. 2020; 20 :363-374 Crossref Scopus (3014) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vabret et al., 2020 51. Vabret, N. ∙ Britton, G.J. ∙ Gruber, C. ..., Sinai Immunology Review Project Immunology of COVID-19: Current State of the Science Immunity. 2020; 52 :910-941 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1203) PubMed Google Scholar ), and effective vaccines and therapeutics may take several months or years to become available. A substantial number of patients become life-threateningly ill, and the mechanisms responsible for causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) in COVID-19 are not well understood. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the key players driving protective and pathogenic immune responses in COVID-19 ( Vabret et al., 2020 51. Vabret, N. ∙ Britton, G.J. ∙ Gruber, C. ..., Sinai Immunology Review Project Immunology of COVID-19: Current State of the Science Immunity. 2020; 52 :910-941 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1203) PubMed Google Scholar ). This knowledge may help devise better therapeutics and vaccines for tackling the current pandemic. CD4 + T cells are key orchestrators of anti-viral immune responses, either by enhancing the effector functions of other immune cell types like cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, NK cells, and B cells or through direct killing of infected cells ( Sallusto, 2016 38. Sallusto, F. Heterogeneity of Human CD4(+) T Cells Against Microbes Annu Rev Immunol. 2016; 34 :317-334 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies in patients with COVID-19 have verified the presence of CD4 + T cells that are reactive to SARS-CoV-2 ( Braun et al., 2020 8. Braun, J. ∙ Loyal, L. ∙ Frentsch, M. ... Sars-Cov-2-Reactive T Cells in Healthy Donors and Patients with Covid-19 Nature. 2020; Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar ; Thieme et al., 2020 48. Thieme, C. ∙ Anft, M. ∙ Paniskaki, K. ...

However, the nature and types of CD4 + T cell subsets that respond to SARS-CoV-2 and the roles these subsets play in driving protective or pathogenic immune responses remain elusive. Here, we have analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of virus-reactive CD4 + T cells to determine associations with severity of COVID-19 illness and to compare the molecular properties of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells to other common respiratory virus-reactive CD4 + T cells from healthy control subjects.

Section: Results

To capture CD4 + T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 illness, we employed the antigen-reactive T cell enrichment (ARTE) assay ( Bacher et al., 2013 4. Bacher, P. ∙ Schink, C. ∙ Teutschbein, J. ...

Impact of Genetic Polymorphisms on Human Immune Cell Gene Expression Cell. 2018; 175 :1701-1715.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (455) PubMed Google Scholar ) that relies on in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for 6 h with overlapping peptide pools targeting the immunogenic domains of the spike and membrane proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (see STAR Methods ; Thieme et al., 2020 48. Thieme, C. ∙ Anft, M. ∙ Paniskaki, K. ... The Sars-Cov-2 T-Cell Immunity Is Directed against the Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid Protein and Associated with Covid 19 Severity Ssrn. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ). Following in vitro stimulation, SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + memory T cells were isolated based on the expression of cell surface markers (CD154 and CD69) that reflect recent engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) by cognate major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes ( Figure S1 A). In the context of acute COVID-19 illness, CD4 + T cells expressing activation markers have been reported in the blood ( Braun et al., 2020 8. Braun, J. ∙ Loyal, L. ∙ Frentsch, M. ... Sars-Cov-2-Reactive T Cells in Healthy Donors and Patients with Covid-19 Nature. 2020; Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar ; Thevarajan et al., 2020 47. Thevarajan, I. ∙ Nguyen, T.H.O. ∙ Koutsakos, M. ... Breadth of concomitant immune responses prior to patient recovery: a case report of non-severe COVID-19 Nat Med. 2020; 26 :453-455 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ); such CD4 + T cells, presumably activated in vivo by endogenous SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, were also captured during the ARTE assay, thereby enabling us to study a comprehensive array of CD4 + T cell subsets responding to SARS-CoV-2. We sorted > 300,000 SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells from > 1.3 billion PBMCs isolated from a total of 40 patients with COVID-19 illness (22 hospitalized patients with severe illness, 9 of whom required intensive care unit [ICU] treatment, and 18 non-hospitalized subjects with relatively milder disease; Figures 1 A and 1B and Tables S1 A and S1 B). In addition to expressing CD154 and CD69, sorted SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells co-expressed other activation-related cell surface markers like CD38, CD137 (4-1BB), CD279 (PD-1), and HLA-DR ( Figures 1 C and S1 B and Table S1 C).
Recent evidence from studies in non-exposed individuals (blood sample obtained pre-COVID-19 pandemic) indicates pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells, possibly indicative of human coronavirus (HCoV) cross-reactivity. Such cells are observed in up to 50% of the subjects studied ( Braun et al., 2020 8. Braun, J. ∙ Loyal, L. ∙ Frentsch, M. ... Sars-Cov-2-Reactive T Cells in Healthy Donors and Patients with Covid-19 Nature. 2020; Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar ; Grifoni et al., 2020 17. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ...

Le Bert, N. ∙ Tan, A.T. ∙ Kunasegaran, K. ... SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls Nature. 2020; 584 :457-462 Crossref Scopus (1405) PubMed Google Scholar ). To capture such SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells, likely to be coronavirus (CoV)-reactive, we screened healthy non-exposed subjects and isolated CD4 + T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools from 4 subjects with highest responder frequency ( Figures 1 A and S1 C and Table S1 D). Next, for defining the CD4 + T cell subsets and their properties that distinguish SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from other common respiratory virus-reactive CD4 + T cells, we isolated CD4 + T cells responding to peptide pools specific to influenza hemagglutinin protein (FLU-reactive cells, see STAR Methods ) from 8 additional healthy subjects who provided blood samples before and/or after influenza vaccination ( Figures 1 A, S1 D, and S1E and Tables S1 D and S1E). CD4 + T cells responding to peptide pools specific to other common respiratory viruses like human parainfluenza (HPIV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) were also isolated from healthy subjects ( Figure S1 C and Tables S1 D and S1F). In total, we interrogated the transcriptome and TCR sequence of >100,000 viral-reactive CD4 + T cells from 53 subjects ( Figures 1 A, S2 A, and S2B and Tables S2 A–S2E).
Analysis of the single-cell transcriptomes of all viral-reactive CD4 + T cells from all subjects revealed 13 CD4 + T cell subsets that clustered distinctly, reflecting their unique transcriptional profiles ( Figures 2 A–2D and Table S2 F). Strikingly, a number of clusters were dominated by cells reactive to particular viruses ( Figures 2 B and S2 C). For example, the vast majority of cells in clusters 1 and 10 were FLU-reactive (>65%), whereas cells in clusters 0, 5, 6, 7, and 12 mainly consisted of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells (>70%) from COVID-19 patients ( Figures 2 B and S2 C). Conversely, cells in clusters 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9 were not preferentially enriched for reactivity to any given virus ( Figures 2 B and S2 C). These findings suggest that distinct viral infections generate CD4 + T cell subsets with distinct transcriptional programs, although the timing of survey (acute illness versus past infection) will also contribute to their cellular states. Our data highlight substantial heterogeneity in the nature of CD4 + T cells generated in response to different viral infections on the one hand and shared features on the other.
The clusters enriched for FLU-reactive CD4 + T cells (clusters 1 and 10) displayed features suggestive of polyfunctional T helper (T H )1 cells which have been associated with protective anti-viral immune responses ( Seder et al., 2008 40. Seder, R.A. ∙ Darrah, P.A. ∙ Roederer, M. T-cell quality in memory and protection: implications for vaccine design Nat Rev Immunol. 2008; 8 :247-258 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such features include the expression of transcripts encoding for the cytokines linked to polyfunctionality such as IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNFα, and several other cytokines and chemokines like IL-3, CSF2, IL-23A, and CCL20 ( Figures 2 D, 2E, S2 E, and S2F). SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells were underrepresented in these clusters (cluster 1 and 10, < 2%) when compared to FLU-reactive cells (> 70%) or HMPV- and HPIV-reactive cells (~5%–20%) ( Figure S2 C). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells in cluster 1 expressed significantly lower levels of IFNG and IL2 transcripts when compared to FLU-reactive cells ( Table S2 G). Together, these data suggested a failure to generate robust polyfunctional T H 1 cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection. A similar pattern was also observed in SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells from healthy non-exposed subjects ( Figures 2 B and S2 C) but not for HPIV- or HMPV-reactive CD4 + T cells, suggesting the defect in generating polyfunctional T H 1 cells may be a common feature for coronaviruses, although further studies specifically analyzing HCoV-reactive CD4 + T cells in healthy individuals will be required to verify this.
Other clusters that were relatively underrepresented for SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells included clusters 2 and 8, which were both enriched for T H 17 signature genes, with cluster 2 highly enriched for cells expressing IL17A and IL17F transcripts, thus representing bona fide T H 17 cells ( Figures 2 B–2F and S2 C–S2E and Table S2 F). T H 17 cells have been associated with protective immune responses in certain models of viral infections ( Acharya et al., 2016 1. Acharya, D. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Paul, A.M. ... Interleukin-17A Promotes CD8+ T Cell Cytotoxicity To Facilitate West Nile Virus Clearance Journal of Virology. 2016; 91 e01529–e16 PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2011 52. Wang, X. ∙ Chan, C.C. ∙ Yang, M. ... A critical role of IL-17 in modulating the B-cell response during H5N1 influenza virus infection Cell Mol Immunol. 2011; 8 :462-468 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, in other contexts they have been shown to promote viral disease pathogenesis ( Acharya et al., 2016 1. Acharya, D. ∙ Wang, P. ∙ Paul, A.M. ... Interleukin-17A Promotes CD8+ T Cell Cytotoxicity To Facilitate West Nile Virus Clearance Journal of Virology. 2016; 91 e01529–e16 PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2019 29.

Therefore, the functional relevance of an impaired T H 17 response in COVID-19 is not clear and requires further investigation.
Clusters that were evenly distributed across all viral-specific CD4 + T cells include clusters 3 and 4. Cluster 3 displayed a transcriptional profile consistent with enrichment of interferon (IFN)-response genes ( IFIT3 , IFI44L , ISG15 , MX2 , OAS1 ), and cluster 4 was enriched for CCR7 , IL7R , and TCF7 transcripts, likely representing central memory CD4 + T cell subset ( Figures 2 B–2F and S2 C–S2E and Table S2 F). Cluster 12, which expressed high levels of transcripts linked to cell cycle genes MKI67 and CDK1 , also contained a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells ( Figures 2 B–2D), indicative of actively proliferating cells responsive to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Cluster 6, also dominated by SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells, was characterized by high levels of PRF1 , GZMB , GZMH , GNLY, and NKG7 transcripts, which encode for molecules linked to cytotoxicity ( Patil et al., 2018 33. Patil, V.S. ∙ Madrigal, A. ∙ Schmiedel, B.J. ... Precursors of Human Cd4(+) Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes Identified by Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Sci Immunol. 2018; 3 :Eaan8664 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 B–2F and S2 C–S2E and Table S2 F). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed significant positive enrichment of signature genes for cytotoxicity in clusters 6 and 9 ( Figure S2 G and Table S2 H), confirming these clusters represent cytotoxic CD4 + T cells (CD4-CTLs).
Clusters 0, 5, and 7, which were colocalized in the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot, were dominated by SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Cells in these clusters were uniformly enriched for transcripts encoding for cytokines, surface markers, and transcriptional coactivators associated with T follicular helper (T FH ) cell function ( CXCL13 , IL21 , CD200 , BTLA, and POU2AF1 ) ( Locci et al., 2013 28. Locci, M. ∙ Havenar-Daughton, C. ∙ Landais, E. ..., International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Protocol C Principal Investigators Human circulating PD-1+CXCR3-CXCR5+ memory Tfh cells are highly functional and correlate with broadly neutralizing HIV antibody responses Immunity. 2013; 39 :758-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (695) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 2 B–2F and S2 C–S2E and Table S2 F). Independent GSEA showed significant positive enrichment of T FH signature genes in these clusters, confirming that cells in these clusters represent circulating T FH cells ( Figure S2 G and Table S2 H). Bona fide T FH cells reside in the germinal center; however, T FH cells have been described in the blood where increased numbers have been reported during viral infections and following vaccinations ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 7. Bentebibel, S.E. ∙ Lopez, S. ∙ Obermoser, G. ... Induction of ICOS+CXCR3+CXCR5+ TH cells correlates with antibody responses to influenza vaccination Sci Transl Med. 2013; 5 :176ra32 Crossref Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koutsakos et al., 2018 24. Koutsakos, M. ∙ Wheatley, A.K. ∙ Loh, L. ... Circulating Tfh Cells, Serological Memory, and Tissue Compartmentalization Shape Human Influenza-Specific B Cell Immunity Sci Transl Med. 2018; 10 :Eaan8405 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smits et al., 2020 43. Smits, M. ∙ Zoldan, K. ∙ Ishaque, N. ... Follicular T helper cells shape the HCV-specific CD4+ T cell repertoire after virus elimination J Clin Invest. 2020; 130 :998-1009 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the increase in circulating SARS-CoV-2-reactive T FH subsets observed in patients with COVID-19 is consistent with published reports in acute infections. Overall, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed substantial differences in the nature of CD4 + T cell responses to viral infections and highlight subsets that are specifically enriched or depleted in COVID-19 illness.
We next assessed if the proportions of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells in any cluster were greater or lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to non-hospitalized patients. Unsupervised clustering of patients, based on the proportions of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells in different clusters, showed that patients with an increased proportion of T FH cells in cluster 0 clustered distinctly from those with increased proportions of T FH cells in cluster 5 or CD4-CTL cells (cluster 6) ( Figure 3 A). The total frequency of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells with a T FH profile (cluster 0, 5, and 7) was not significantly different between hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( Figure 3 B). However, the relative proportion of T FH cells in cluster 5 was significantly greater in hospitalized patients (severe disease) compared to non-hospitalized patients (mild disease), and the inverse was observed for the proportion of T FH cells in cluster 0 ( Figures 3 C and S3 A and Table S2 B). This pattern was maintained irrespective of whether the patients’ samples were analyzed early (< 3 weeks from symptom onset) or later (> 3 weeks) in the course of illness ( Figure S3 B). Notably, the proportion of T FH cells in cluster 7 was not significantly different between hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( Figure S3 C).
To determine the transcriptional features that differentiated SARS-CoV-2-reactive T FH cells present in cluster 5 from those in cluster 0, we performed single-cell differential gene expression analysis ( Figure S3 D and Table S3 A). Transcripts encoding for transcription factors zinc finger BED-type-containing 2 (ZBED2) and zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 32 (ZBTB32) were enriched in T FH cells in cluster 5 and were also expressed at significantly higher levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( Figures 3 D and S3 D and Tables S3 A and S3B). ZBTB32, also known as PLZP, belongs to a broad-complex, tramtrack and bric-à-brac zinc finger (BTB-ZF) family of transcriptional repressors like PLZF, B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), and T-helper-inducing POZ-Kruppel-like factor (ThPOK) and has been shown to play a role in impairing anti-viral immune responses by negatively regulating T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and development of long-term memory cells ( Piazza et al., 2004 36. Piazza, F. ∙ Costoya, J.A. ∙ Merghoub, T. ... Disruption of PLZP in mice leads to increased T-lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production, and altered hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis Mol Cell Biol. 2004; 24 :10456-10469 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin et al., 2017 42.

Transient expression of ZBTB32 in anti-viral CD8+ T cells limits the magnitude of the effector response and the generation of memory PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006544 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). ZBED2, a novel zinc finger transcription factor without a mouse ortholog, has been linked to T cell dysfunction in the context of anti-tumor immune response ( Li et al., 2019 27. Li, H. ∙ Van Der Leun, A.M. ∙ Yofe, I. ... Dysfunctional Cd8 T Cells Form a Proliferative, Dynamically Regulated Compartment within Human Melanoma Cell. 2019; 176 :775-789.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (661) PubMed Google Scholar ) and more recently shown to repress expression of IFN target genes ( Somerville et al., 2020 44. Somerville, T.D.D. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Wu, X.S. ... ZBED2 is an antagonist of interferon regulatory factor 1 and modifies cell identity in pancreatic cancer Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 117 :11471-11482 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). In support of potential dysfunctional properties of the cells in the T FH cluster 5, we found increased expression of several transcripts encoding for molecules linked to inhibitory function, like TIGIT, LAG3, TIM3, and PD1 ( Thommen and Schumacher, 2018 49. Thommen, D.S. ∙ Schumacher, T.N. T Cell Dysfunction in Cancer Cancer Cell. 2018; 33 :547-562 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (767) PubMed Google Scholar ), and to negative regulation of T cell activation and proliferation, like DUSP4 and CD70 ( Huang et al., 2012 18. Huang, C.Y. ∙ Lin, Y.C. ∙ Hsiao, W.Y. ... DUSP4 deficiency enhances CD25 expression and CD4+ T-cell proliferation without impeding T-cell development Eur J Immunol. 2012; 42 :476-488 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ; O’Neill et al., 2017 31.

T Cell-Derived CD70 Delivers an Immune Checkpoint Function in Inflammatory T Cell Responses J Immunol. 2017; 199 :3700-3710 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 D and S3 D and Table S3 A).
Most strikingly, T FH cells in cluster 5 expressed high levels of cytotoxicity-associated transcripts ( PRF1 , GZMB ) ( Figures 3 E, S3 D, and S3E), reminiscent of the recently described cytotoxic T FH cells, which were shown to directly kill B cells and associated with the pathogenesis of recurrent tonsillitis in children ( Dan et al., 2019 12. Dan, J.M. ∙ Havenar-Daughton, C. ∙ Kendric, K. ... Recurrent Group A Streptococcus Tonsillitis Is an Immunosusceptibility Disease Involving Antibody Deficiency and Aberrant Tfh Cells Sci Transl Med. 2019; 11 :Eaau3776 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of relevance, recent studies reported a striking loss of germinal center B cells in the thoracic lymph nodes and spleen of patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Kaneko et al., 2020 22. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.-H. ∙ Boucau, J. ... The Loss of Bcl-6 Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and the Absence of Germinal Centers in Covid-19 Cell. 2020; 183 :143-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as slightly lower SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in deceased COVID-19 patients ( Atyeo et al., 2020 3. Atyeo, C. ∙ Fischinger, S. ∙ Zohar, T. ... Distinct Early Serological Signatures Track with Sars-Cov-2 Survival Immunity. 2020; 53 :524-532.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that the cytotoxic T FH cells (cluster 5) observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients may impair humoral (B cell) immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. To test this association, we assessed the correlation between the proportions of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T FH cell subsets and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 (S1 and S2 subunits), which was higher in hospitalized patients ( Figures 3 F, 3G, and S3 G). Although the total frequency of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T FH cells (clusters 0, 5, and 7) showed a positive correlation with antibody levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but not in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( Figure 3 F), the relative proportions of cytotoxic T FH cells (T FH cells in cluster 5) showed a strong negative correlation with anti-S1/S2 antibody levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( Figure 3 G and Table S3 C). Conversely, the proportions of T FH cells in cluster 0 (non-cytotoxic) were positively correlated with antibody concentrations in hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( Figure S3 H). We noted that the magnitude of cytotoxic T FH response (cluster 5) also showed a significant negative correlation with the time interval between onset of illness and sample collection, suggesting that their association with antibody levels could be confounded by the timing of analysis of patients’ samples ( Figure 3 G and Table S3 C). Furthermore, we did not observe this negative association between cytotoxic T FH cells and anti-S1/S2 antibody levels in non-hospitalized patients, which suggested that other mechanisms such as lower viral titers may explain the low levels of anti-S1/S2 antibodies in non-hospitalized patients. To further assess effects on B cell function, we analyzed B cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 and S2 subunits) from nine patients with varying proportion of cytotoxic T FH cells. Notably, in the hospitalized patients with high proportions of cytotoxic T FH cells (patients 08, 09, and 16), we observed a much smaller number of S1/S2-specific B cells compared to those with lower proportions of these cytotoxic T FH cells ( Figure S3 I). Future longitudinal studies that examine the kinetics of T and B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are likely to provide more definitive and time-resolved associations between cytotoxic T FH cell and antibody responses.
Next, to characterize upstream regulators that may induce the differentiation and maintenance of the cytotoxic T FH cells, we performed Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) of the transcripts increased in SARS-CoV-2-reactive T FH cells in cluster 5 (cytotoxic) when compared to those in cluster 0 ( Tables S3 D and S3E). Surprisingly, we found that type 1 and 2 IFNs emerged as the top upstream activators of genes enriched in the cytotoxic T FH cluster ( Figure S3 J and Tables S3 D and S3E). GSEA confirmed that IFN response signatures were also significantly enriched in the cytotoxic T FH cluster (cluster 5) ( Figure S3 K). Single-cell trajectory analysis showed that a large fraction of cytotoxic T FH cells (cluster 5) followed a separate trajectory from cluster 0 cells ( Figure 3 H), and cells in this track were enriched for the IFN response signature. In addition, we found that transcripts encoding perforin ( PRF1 ) and the transcription factor ZBED2 were also enriched in the cytotoxic T FH cell trajectory, which suggested the hypothesis that ZBED2 may contribute to the differentiation or function of cytotoxic T FH cells, although further studies will be needed to verify this.
While T cells with cytotoxic function are thought to predominantly consist of conventional MHC class I-restricted CD8 + T cells, MHC class II-restricted CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic potential (CD4-CTLs) have also been reported in several viral infections in humans and are associated with better clinical outcomes ( Cheroutre and Husain, 2013 10.

Dengue virus infection elicits highly polarized CX3CR1+ cytotoxic CD4+ T cells associated with protective immunity Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2015; 112 :E4256-E4263 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). Paradoxically, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we find that cells in the CD4-CTL clusters ( Figure 4 A; cluster 6 and 9) were present at higher frequencies in some hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, potentially contributing to disease severity, although we observed substantial heterogeneity in responses among patients ( Figures 4 B and 3 A and Table S2 B).
Interrogation of the transcripts enriched in the CD4-CTL subsets pointed to several interesting molecules and transcription factors that are likely to play an important role in their maintenance and effector function. These include molecules like CD72 and GPR18 that are known to enhance T cell proliferation and maintenance of mucosal T cell subsets, respectively ( Jiang et al., 2017 20. Jiang, X. ∙ Björkström, N.K. ∙ Melum, E.

GPR18 is required for a normal CD8αα intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment J Exp Med. 2014; 211 :2351-2359 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 C and S4 A). Additional examples include transcription factors HOPX and ZEB2 ( Figures 4 C and S4 A) that have been shown to positively regulate effector differentiation, function, persistence, and survival of T cells ( Albrecht et al., 2010 2. Albrecht, I. ∙ Niesner, U. ∙ Janke, M. ... Persistence of effector memory Th1 cells is regulated by Hopx European Journal of Immunology. 2010; 40 :2993-3006 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Omilusik et al., 2015 32.

Transcriptional repressor ZEB2 promotes terminal differentiation of CD8+ effector and memory T cell populations during infection J Exp Med. 2015; 212 :2027-2039 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). Besides cytotoxicity-associated transcripts, the CD4-CTL subsets (clusters 6 and 9) and cytotoxic T FH cells (cluster 5) were highly enriched for transcripts encoding for a number of chemokines like CCL3 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), and CCL5 ( Figures 4 D and S2 F); these chemokines play an important role in the recruitment of myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages), NK cells, and T cells expressing C-C type chemokine receptors (CCR)1, CCR3, and CCR5 ( Hughes and Nibbs, 2018 19. Hughes, C.E. ∙ Nibbs, R.J.B. A guide to chemokines and their receptors FEBS J. 2018; 285 :2944-2971 Crossref Scopus (765) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CD4-CTL subset in cluster 6 and cytotoxic T FH cells (cluster 5) also expressed high levels of transcripts encoding for chemokines XCL1 and XCL2 ( Figures 4 D, S4 B, and S4C) that specifically recruit XCR1-expressing conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) to sites of immune responses where they play a key role in promoting the CD8 + T cell responses by antigen cross-presentation ( Lei and Takahama, 2012 26. Lei, Y. ∙ Takahama, Y. XCL1 and XCR1 in the immune system Microbes Infect. 2012; 14 :262-267 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, the transcriptomic features of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4-CTLs and cytotoxic T FH cells suggest that they are likely to play an important role in orchestrating immune responses by recruiting innate immune cells to enhance CD8 + T cell responses, while also directly mediating cytotoxic death of MHC class II-expressing virally infected cells.
The recovery of paired TCR sequences from individual single cells enabled us to link transcriptome data to clonotype information and evaluate the clonal relationship between different CD4 + T cell subsets as well as determine the nature of subsets that display greatest clonal expansion ( Tables S4 A and S4B). In SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalized patients were characterized by large clonal expansion of the virus-reactive CD4 + T cells (mean of 55.8%); in contrast, in non-hospitalized patients, recovered TCRs were less clonally expanded (mean of 38.0%) ( Figure S4 D). Among SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells, CD4-CTL subsets (clusters 6 and 9) displayed the greatest clonal expansion (> 75% of cells were clonally expanded), indicating preferential expansion and persistence of CD4-CTLs in some patients with COVID-19 illness ( Figure 4 E and Tables S4 A and S4B). Analysis of clonally expanded SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells from COVID-19 patients showed extensive sharing of TCRs between cells in clusters 6 and 9, as well as those in cluster 11 ( Figure 4 F), which, notably, was enriched for the expression of XCL1 and XCL2 transcripts and also for cytotoxicity-associated transcripts, albeit at lower levels compared to the established CD4-CTL clusters ( Figures 4 D and S4 C and Table S2 F). Thus, cells in cluster 11 are likely to be an intermediate transition population, a hypothesis supported by single-cell trajectory analysis that showed potential temporal connection and transcriptional similarity between these subsets ( Figure 4 G).
Initial reports in patients with acute COVID-19 have suggested that circulating T cells that express activation markers such as CD38, HLA-DR, and PD-1 ex vivo (without in vitro peptide stimulation) are enriched for SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells ( Braun et al., 2020 8. Braun, J. ∙ Loyal, L. ∙ Frentsch, M. ... Sars-Cov-2-Reactive T Cells in Healthy Donors and Patients with Covid-19 Nature. 2020; Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar ; Thevarajan et al., 2020 47. Thevarajan, I. ∙ Nguyen, T.H.O. ∙ Koutsakos, M. ... Breadth of concomitant immune responses prior to patient recovery: a case report of non-severe COVID-19 Nat Med. 2020; 26 :453-455 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a recent study indicated that bystander T cells reactive to other antigens (e.g., CMV and EBV) can also express these activation markers, likely to be non-specifically activated without TCR engagement ( Sekine et al., 2020 41. Sekine, T. ∙ Perez-Potti, A. ∙ Rivera-Ballesteros, O. ... Robust T Cell Immunity in Convalescent Individuals with Asymptomatic or Mild Covid-19 Cell. 2020; 183 :158-168.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1282) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, studies in active SARS-CoV-2 infection that just examine T cells expressing activation markers are not likely to reveal the full potential effector function of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells. To determine the specificity and molecular features of such T cells expressing activation markers ex vivo , we isolated CD38 high HLA-DR high PD-1 + memory CD4 + T cells from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and performed single-cell transcriptome and TCR sequence analysis of >20,000 cells. CD4 + T cells expressing activation markers ex vivo clustered distinctly from the SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells, which were isolated following in vitro stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides for 6 h ( Figure S4 E and Tables S2 C–S2E, S4 C, and S4D). The CD4 + T cells expressing activation markers ex vivo displayed reduced activation and T FH signature scores and had lower expression of transcripts encoding effector cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, TNFα), activation markers (OX40), and T FH associated genes ( CD200 , POU2AF1 ) ( Figures S4 F and S4G). Furthermore, by comparison of single-cell TCR sequences, we found that 33.8% of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells shared clonotypes with CD4 + T cells expressing activation markers ex vivo, and 12.2% of CD4 + T cells expressing activation markers ex vivo shared their TCRs with SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells ( Figure S4 H and Tables S4 E and S4F). Our findings indicate that using surface activation markers as a strategy to enrich for SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells without SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation (ARTE assay) may not capture the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, like T FH biology and their cytokine profiles, although the transcriptomic features of such in vitro activated cells may be affected by antigen-presenting cells present in the cultures.
In order to capture SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells that may not upregulate the activation markers (CD154 and CD69) after 6 h of in vitro stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools, we stimulated PMBCs from the same cultures for a total of 24 h (see STAR Methods ) and captured cells based on co-expression of activation markers CD137 (4-1BB) and CD69, a strategy that allowed us to additionally capture antigen-specific regulatory T cells (T REG ) ( Bacher et al., 2016 5. Bacher, P. ∙ Heinrich, F. ∙ Stervbo, U. ... Regulatory T Cell Specificity Directs Tolerance Versus Allergy against Aeroantigens in Humans Cell. 2016; 167 :1067-1078.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 A and S5 A). Our analysis of a total of 38,519 single-cell CD4 + T cell transcriptomes revealed 6 distinct clusters ( Figures 5 A–5C and Tables S5 A–S5C). The T FH subset (cluster D) was detectable at relatively lower frequencies in the 24 h condition, though they represented the major CD4 + T cell subsets in the 6 h stimulation condition ( Figures 2 A and 5 A). Consistent with delayed kinetics of activation of central memory T (T CM ) cells, we identified a higher proportion of CD4 + T cells expressing transcripts linked to central memory cells ( CCR7 , IL7R , and TCF7 ) (cluster C) ( Figures 2 A, 5 A, and 5C).
The largest cluster (cluster A) was characterized by high expression of FOXP3 transcripts, which encodes for the T REG master transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) ( Rudensky, 2011 37. Rudensky, A.Y. Regulatory T cells and Foxp3 Immunol Rev. 2011; 241 :260-268 Crossref Scopus (646) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 A–5D and Table S5 C). Independent GSEA analysis showed significant positive enrichment of T REG signature genes in this cluster, suggesting that cells in this cluster represented SARS-CoV-2-reactive T REG cells ( Figure S5 B and Table S2 H). Notably, the proportion of cells in the T REG cluster was significantly lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to non-hospitalized patients ( Figures 5 D, 5E, and S5 C and Tables S5 A and S5B), suggesting a potential defect in the generation of immunosuppressive SARS-CoV-2-reactive T REG cells in hospitalized patients. Consistent with our data from 6 h stimulation condition, we found that cells in the CD4-CTL clusters (clusters B and F) were present at higher frequencies in some hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( Figures 5 E, 5F, and S5 C and Tables S5 A and S5B). They also showed the greatest clonal expansion compared to other clusters ( Figures S5 D an S5E and Table S4 B), suggesting potential importance of the CD4-CTL subset in driving immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Correlation analysis of the proportion of CD4-CTLs and T REG in our 24 h dataset revealed a significant negative correlation, which indicated that patients with an impaired T REG response to SARS-CoV-2 mounted a stronger CD4-CTL response ( Figure 5 G and Table S5 D). A recent study in a murine model showed that cytotoxic T FH responses are curtailed by a subset of T REG cells called follicular regulatory T (T FR ) cells ( Xie et al., 2019 56. Xie, M.M. ∙ Fang, S. ∙ Chen, Q. ... Follicular regulatory T cells inhibit the development of granzyme B-expressing follicular helper T cells JCI Insight. 2019; 4 :E128076 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if such association is observed in our datasets, we first quantified T FR cells based on the expression of IL1R2 ( Eschweiler et al., 2020 15. Eschweiler, S. ∙ Clarke, J. ∙ Ramirez Suastegui, C. ... T Fr Cells Inhibit Anti-Tumor Immunity and Are Responsive to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Ssrn. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ) from cells in the T REG cluster A ( Figure 5 H). Independent GSEA confirmed that IL1R2 -expressing cells were significantly enriched for follicular and T FR signature genes ( Figure S5 F), which indicated they represent T FR cells. Over 40% of the cells in the T REG cluster expressed IL1R2 ; this indicates that a strong circulating T FR response is generated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, the proportion of T FR cells was significantly lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients ( Figure 5 H) and showed a modest negative correlation with the proportion of cytotoxic T FH cells ( Figure 5 I and Table S5 E). On the basis of these findings and the known function of these T REG subsets, we hypothesize that the magnitude of T REG and T FR responses to SARS-CoV-2 are likely to modulate cytotoxic CD4 + T and B cell responses in COVID-19 illness, although further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.

Section: Discussion

There is an urgent need to better understand the molecular determinants of protective and pathogenic immune responses in COVID-19. Given the importance of CD4 + T cells in anti-viral immunity, studying this adaptive immune cell population is likely to provide insights into the nature of host responses observed in patients with COVID-19. Current studies on antigen-specific CD4 + T cells are limited to flow-cytometry-based phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2-responding cells using limited sets of markers ( Braun et al., 2020 8. Braun, J. ∙ Loyal, L. ∙ Frentsch, M. ... Sars-Cov-2-Reactive T Cells in Healthy Donors and Patients with Covid-19 Nature. 2020; Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar ; Grifoni et al., 2020 17. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ... Targets of T Cell Responses to Sars-Cov-2 Coronavirus in Humans with Covid-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals Cell. 2020; 181 :1489-1501.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2630) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thieme et al., 2020 48. Thieme, C. ∙ Anft, M. ∙ Paniskaki, K. ... The Sars-Cov-2 T-Cell Immunity Is Directed against the Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid Protein and Associated with Covid 19 Severity Ssrn. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ), which thus fail to comprehensively capture the breadth of CD4 + T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2. Unbiased approaches employing single-cell RNA-seq assays can provide these insights; however, to our knowledge, single-cell studies to date have only examined total CD4 + T cells in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from patients with COVID-19 illness ( Vabret et al., 2020 51. Vabret, N. ∙ Britton, G.J. ∙ Gruber, C. ..., Sinai Immunology Review Project Immunology of COVID-19: Current State of the Science Immunity. 2020; 52 :910-941 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1203) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to the rarity of SARS-CoV-2-specific cells in the total CD4 + T cell populations, signals from these cells are likely to be masked by the relative abundance of other non-antigen-specific CD4 + T cells. Furthermore, despite a profusion of single-cell transcriptomic studies, the analysis of virus-specific or any antigen-specific T cells, as such in humans, has lagged behind, partly due to the challenges imposed by methods to isolate antigen-specific T cells in sufficient numbers. Here, we have overcame these issues and performed single-cell transcriptomic study of >100,000 virus-reactive CD4 + T cells, focused on SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from 40 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity, and compared their molecular profile to CD4 + T cells reactive to other common respiratory viruses.
We find remarkable heterogeneity in the nature of CD4 + T cell subsets that are reactive to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and across individual patients and with differing severity of COVID-19. Polyfunctional T H 1 cells, which are abundant among FLU-reactive CD4 + T cells and considered to be protective ( Seder et al., 2008 40. Seder, R.A. ∙ Darrah, P.A. ∙ Roederer, M. T-cell quality in memory and protection: implications for vaccine design Nat Rev Immunol. 2008; 8 :247-258 Crossref Scopus (1270) PubMed Google Scholar ), were present in lower frequencies among SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells. Lower frequencies of T H 17 cells were also observed among SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells. In contrast, we find increased proportions of SARS-CoV-2-reactive cytotoxic T FH cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Cytotoxic T FH cells can kill B cells and dampen germinal center responses ( Xie et al., 2019 56. Xie, M.M. ∙ Fang, S. ∙ Chen, Q. ... Follicular regulatory T cells inhibit the development of granzyme B-expressing follicular helper T cells JCI Insight. 2019; 4 :E128076 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), and to our knowledge this is the first description of circulating cytotoxic T FH cells in humans. Importantly, the magnitude of the cytotoxic T FH response to SARS-CoV-2 was stronger early in the course of illness and negatively correlated with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 S. Recent reports have found that patients with fatal COVID-19 infections have abrogated germinal center B cell responses ( Kaneko et al., 2020 22. Kaneko, N. ∙ Kuo, H.-H. ∙ Boucau, J. ... The Loss of Bcl-6 Expressing T Follicular Helper Cells and the Absence of Germinal Centers in Covid-19 Cell. 2020; 183 :143-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ) and very slightly reduced levels of S-specific IgM antibodies ( Atyeo et al., 2020 3. Atyeo, C. ∙ Fischinger, S. ∙ Zohar, T. ... Distinct Early Serological Signatures Track with Sars-Cov-2 Survival Immunity. 2020; 53 :524-532.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ), the mechanistic basis of which is not known. Our findings of strong cytotoxic T FH responses early in the illness may provide the link to defects in B cells responses in some patients with severe and fatal COVID-19 illness.
Another striking observation is the abundance in SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells of CD4-CTLs that express high levels of transcripts encoding for multiple chemokines (XCL1, XCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5), particularly from some hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This suggests that the CD4-CTL responses in COVID-19 illness may be linked to pathogenesis, although further studies in animal models and large-scale association studies in COVID-19 patients are required to verify or refute this hypothesis. Notably, some hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed impaired T REG response to SARS-CoV-2, and such patients mounted a strong CD4-CTL response, raising another interesting association that warrants testing in larger studies.
The limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size considering the heterogeneity observed in the nature of CD4 + T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of patients in the acute and convalescent phase of illness fails to discriminate effector and long-term memory CD4 + T cell responses. Serial sampling of the same patients in the recovered phase is likely to provide insights into the nature and persistence of memory CD4 + T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Because the negative association between cytotoxic T FH cell responses and anti-spike antibody levels was not observed in non-hospitalized patients, the potential role of cytotoxic T FH cells in antibody responses cannot be generalized. Furthermore, the higher proportions of cytotoxic T FH cells in hospitalized patients may merely reflect higher viral titers and IFN production. Longitudinal studies are required to clarify the association between aberrant cytotoxic T FH responses and their impact on modulating the magnitude and duration of protective antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. The role of CD4-CTLs in protective or pathogenic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 needs to be clarified in pre-clinical models. Future studies in COVID-19 patients should also examine the relationships between the subsets of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells in the blood and those observed in the mucosal tissues where control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical.

Ethical approval for this study from the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee 20/SC/0155 and the Ethics Committee of La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) was in place. Written consent was obtained from all subjects. 22 hospitalized patients in a large teaching hospital in the south of England with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2, between April-May 2020 were recruited to the study. A further cohort of 18 participants consisting of healthcare workers who were not hospitalized with COVID-19 illness, confirmed based on RT-PCR assay or serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, were also recruited over the same period. All subjects provided up to 80 mL of blood for research studies. Clinical and demographic data were collected from patient records for hospitalized patients including comorbidities, blood results, drug intervention, radiological involvement, thrombotic events, microbiology, and virology results (Table S1A). The 22 hospitalized patients had a median age of 60 (33-82), 17 of these patients (77%) were men and this cohort consisted of 16 (73%) White British/White Other, 4 (18%) Indian, and 2 (9%) Black British patients. All hospitalized patients survived to discharge from hospital. All hospitalized patients were still symptomatic at time of blood collection, whereas some of the non-hospitalized patients (4/18) were symptom free (Table S1A). The 18 non-hospitalized participants had a median age of 39 (22-50), 8 (44%) of these participants were men and this cohort consisted of 15 (83%) White British/White Other, 2 (11%) Arab, and 1 (6%) Chinese participant. We noted that the median age of the non-hospitalized patients was lower than the hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
To study HPIV, HMPV, and SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells from healthy non-exposed subjects (pre-COVID-19 pandemic), we utilized de-identified buffy coat samples from 5 healthy adult donors who donated blood at the San Diego Blood Bank before 2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Donors were considered to be in good health, free of cold or flu-like symptoms and with no history of Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection. The median age was 50 (32-71) and 4 of these patients (80%) were men. To study FLU-reactive cells, we obtained de-identified blood samples from 8 donors enrolled in the LJI Normal Blood Donor Program before and/or after (12 - 14 days) receiving the FLUCELVAX vaccine (September and October 2019). The median age was 37 (26-57) and 5 of these patients (63%) were women. Approval for the use of this material was obtained from the LJI Ethics Committee.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from up to 80ml of anti-coagulated blood by density centrifugation over Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) and cryopreserved in 50% decomplemented human antibody serum, 40% complete RMPI 1640 medium and 10% DMSO.
Pools of lyophilized peptides covering the immunodominant sequence of the spike glycoprotein and the complete sequence of the membrane glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (15-mer sequences with 11 amino acids overlap) were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec ( Thieme et al., 2020 48. Thieme, C. ∙ Anft, M. ∙ Paniskaki, K. ... The Sars-Cov-2 T-Cell Immunity Is Directed against the Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid Protein and Associated with Covid 19 Severity Ssrn. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ) resuspended and stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin S.p.A., Saluggia, Italy) was utilized as per the manufacturer’s instructions to obtain quantitative antibody results from plasma samples via an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) in a United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) diagnostic laboratory at University Hospital Southampton. Sample results were interpreted as positive (≥ 15 AU/mL), Equivocal (≥ 12.0 and < 15.0 AU/mL) and negative (< 12 AU/mL).
To assess the level of SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2-specific B cells, cells were prepared in staining buffer (PBS with 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA), FcγR blocked (clone 2.4G2, BD Biosciences), stained with indicated primary antibodies and biotinylated S1/S2 proteins (Sino Biological) for 30 min at 4°C; washed, and subsequently stained with streptavidin-BV421. Patients 10, 24 and 49 were analyzed on a different day with a lower intensity violet laser and required different gating.
The Human Parainfluenza (HPIV) and Metapneumovirus (HMPV) CD4 + T cell peptide megapools (MPs) were produced by sequential lyophilization of viral-specific epitopes as previously described ( Carrasco Pro et al., 2015 9. Carrasco Pro, S. ∙ Sidney, J. ∙ Paul, S. ... Automatic Generation of Validated Specific Epitope Sets J Immunol Res. 2015; 2015 :763461 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar , Weiskopf et al., 2015b 55.

Human CD8+ T-Cell Responses Against the 4 Dengue Virus Serotypes Are Associated With Distinct Patterns of Protein Targets J Infect Dis. 2015; 212 :1743-1751 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Full lists of the viral protein sequences derived from the uniprot database and used for the HPIV and HMPV MP designs are available in Table S1F. T cell prediction was performed using TepiTool tool, available in identification epitope database analysis resources (IEDB-AR, LJI), applying the 7-allele prediction method and a median cutoff ≤20 ( Dhanda et al., 2019 14. Dhanda, S.K. ∙ Mahajan, S. ∙ Paul, S. ...

Tepitool: A Pipeline for Computational Prediction of T Cell Epitope Candidates Curr Protoc Immunol. 2016; 114 :18.19.1-18.19.24 Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar ). For the HA-influenza MP, we selected 177 experimentally defined epitopes, retrieved by querying the IEDB database ( www.IEDB.org ) on 07/12/19 with search parameters “positive assay only, No B cell assays, No MHC ligand assay, Host: Homo Sapiens and MHC restriction class II.” The list of epitopes was enriched with predicted peptides derived from the HA sequences of the vaccine strains available in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 (A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1), B/Brisbane/60/2008, A/Hong_Kong/4801/2014(H3N2), A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1), A/Alaska/06/2016(H3N2), B/Iowa/06/2017, and B/Phuket/3073/2013). The resulting peptides were then clustered using the IEDB cluster 2.0 tool and the IEDB recommended method (cluster-break method) with a 70% cut off for sequence identity applied ( Dhanda et al., 2019 14. Dhanda, S.K. ∙ Mahajan, S. ∙ Paul, S. ...

Dhanda, S.K. ∙ Vaughan, K. ∙ Schulten, V. ... Development of a novel clustering tool for linear peptide sequences Immunology. 2018; 155 :331-345 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Table S1E). Peptides were synthesized as crude material (A&A, San Diego, CA), resuspended in DMSO, pooled according to each MP composition and finally sequentially lyophilized ( Carrasco Pro et al., 2015 9. Carrasco Pro, S. ∙ Sidney, J. ∙ Paul, S. ... Automatic Generation of Validated Specific Epitope Sets J Immunol Res. 2015; 2015 :763461 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). For screening healthy non-exposed subjects (samples provided before the current pandemic) who cross-react to SARS-CoV-2, we screened 20 healthy non-exposed subjects using SARS-CoV-2 peptide CD4-R and CD4-S pools, as described ( Grifoni et al., 2020 17. Grifoni, A. ∙ Weiskopf, D. ∙ Ramirez, S.I. ... Targets of T Cell Responses to Sars-Cov-2 Coronavirus in Humans with Covid-19 Disease and Unexposed Individuals Cell. 2020; 181 :1489-1501.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2630) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Enrichment and FACS sorting of virus-reactive CD154 + CD4 + memory T cells following peptide pool stimulation was adapted from Bacher et al. 2016 ( Bacher et al., 2016 5. Bacher, P. ∙ Heinrich, F. ∙ Stervbo, U. ... Regulatory T Cell Specificity Directs Tolerance Versus Allergy against Aeroantigens in Humans Cell. 2016; 167 :1067-1078.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, PBMCs from each donor, were thawed, washed, plated in 24-well culture plates at a concentration of 5 × 10 6 cells/mL in 1 mL of serum-free TexMACS medium (Miltenyi Biotec) and left overnight (5% CO 2 , 37 °C). Cells were stimulated by the addition of individual virus-specific peptide pools (1 μg/mL) for 6 h in the presence of a blocking CD40 antibody (1 μg/mL; Miltenyi Biotec). For subsequent MACS-based enrichment of CD154 + , cells were sequentially stained with fluorescence-labeled surface antibodies (antibody list in Table S1G), Cell-hashtag TotalSeq-C antibody (0.5 μg/condition), and a biotin-conjugated CD154 antibody (clone 5C8; Miltenyi Biotec) followed by anti-biotin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Labeled cells were added to MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) and positively selected cells (CD154 + ) were eluted and used for FACS sorting of CD154 + memory CD4 + T cells. The flow-through from the column was collected and re-plated to harvest cells responding 24 h after peptide stimulation. Analogous to enrichment for CD154 + , CD137-expressing CD4 + memory T cells were positively selected by staining with biotin-conjugated CD137 antibody (clone REA765; Miltenyi Biotec) followed by anti-biotin MicroBeads and applied to a new MS column. Following elution, enriched populations were immediately sorted using a FACSAria Fusion Cell Sorter (Becton Dickinson) based on dual expression of CD154 and CD69 for the 6 h stimulation condition, and CD137 and CD69 for the 24 h stimulation condition. The gating strategy used for sorting is shown in Figures S1A and S4B. All flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10).
For combined single-cell RNA-seq and TCR-seq assays (10x Genomics), a maximum of 60,000 virus-reactive memory CD4 + T cells from up to 8 donors were pooled by sorting into low retention 1.5 mL collection tubes, containing 500 μl of a 1:1 solution of PBS:FBS supplemented with recombinant RNase inhibitor (1:100, Takara). For healthy donors, when possible, equal numbers of cells were isolated from each donor and pooled before 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq experiments. For analysis of FLU-reactive CD4 + T cell responses, we sequenced paired pre- and post-vaccination samples from 4 donors and supplemented this with 2 non-paired samples for both pre- and post-vaccination. Samples from both pre- and post-vaccination were pooled for analysis of FLU-reactive CD4 + T cells. Following sorting, ice-cold PBS was added to make up to a volume of 1400 μl. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min (600 g at 4 °C) and the supernatant was carefully removed leaving 5 to 10 μl. 25 μl of resuspension buffer (0.22 μm filtered ice-cold PBS supplemented with ultra-pure bovine serum albumin; 0.04%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the tube and the pellet was gently but thoroughly resuspended. Following careful mixing, 33 μl of the cell suspension was transferred to a PCR-tube for processing as per the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics).
Briefly, single-cell RNA-sequencing library preparation was performed as per the manufacturer’s recommendations for the 10x Genomics 5' TAG v1.0 chemistry with immune profiling and cell surface protein technology. Both initial amplification of cDNA and library preparation were carried out with 13 cycles of amplification; V(D)J and cell surface protein libraries were generated corresponding to each 5'' TAG gene expression library using 9 cycles and 8 cycles of amplification, respectively. Libraries were quantified and pooled according to equivalent molar concentrations and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencing platform with the following read lengths: read 1 – 101 cycles; read 2 – 101 cycles; and i7 index - 8 cycles.
Reads from single-cell RNA-seq were aligned and collapsed into Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) counts using 10x Genomics’ Cell Ranger software (v3.1.0) and mapped to GRCh37 reference (v3.0.0) genome. Hashtag UMI counts for each TotalSeq-C antibody capture library were generated with the Feature Barcoding Analysis pipeline from Cell Ranger. To demultiplex donors, UMI counts of cell barcodes were first obtained from the raw data output, and only cells with at least 100 UMI for the hashtag with the highest UMI counts were considered for donor assignment. Donor identities were inferred by MULTIseqDemux (autoThresh = TRUE and maxiter = 10) from Seurat (v3.1.5) using the UMI counts. Each cell barcode was assigned a donor ID, marked as a Doublet or having a Negative enrichment. Cells were re-classified as doublets if the ratio of UMI counts between the top 2 barcodes was less than 3. Cells labeled as Doublet or Negative were removed from downstream analyses. Raw 10x data were independently aggregated using Cell Ranger’s aggr function (v3.1.0). Donors P28 and P48 were not stained with hashtag antibodies and therefore did not contribute to any donor-specific data. The merged data was transferred to the R statistical environment for analysis using the package Seurat (v3.1.5) ( Stuart et al., 2019 45. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 E21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7310) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further minimize doublets and to eliminate cells with low quality transcriptomes, cells expressing < 800 and > 4400 unique genes, < 1500 and > 20,000 total UMI content, and > 10% of mitochondrial UMIs were excluded. The summary statistics for all the single-cell transcriptome libraries are provided in Table S2C-E and indicate good quality data with no major differences in quality control metrics across multiple batches, where batches are groups of donors whose libraries were sequenced together (Figure S2A). This procedure was independently applied for data from CD4 + T cells stimulated for 0 and 6 h, 6 and 24 h.
For single-cell transcriptome analysis only genes expressed in at least 0.1% of the cells were included. The transcriptome data was then log-transformed and normalized (by a factor of 10,000) per cell, using default settings in Seurat software ( Stuart et al., 2019 45. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 E21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7310) PubMed Google Scholar ). Variable genes with a mean UMI expression greater than 0.01 and explaining 25% of the total variance were selected using the Variance Stabilizing Transformation method, as described ( Stuart et al., 2019 45. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 E21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7310) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcriptomic data from each cell was then further scaled by regressing the number of UMI-detected and percentage of mitochondrial counts. For data from CD4 + T cells stimulated for 6 h, principal component analysis was performed using the variable genes, and based on the standard deviation of PCs in the “elbow plot,” the first 38 principal components (PCs) were selected for further analyses. Cells were clustered using the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions in Seurat with a resolution of 0.6. The robustness of clustering was independently verified by other clustering methods and by modifying the number of PCs and variable genes utilized for clustering. Analysis of clustering patterns across multiple batches revealed no evidence of strong batch effects (Figure S2A). For data from CD4 + T cells stimulated for 24 h, the first 16 PCs were selected for further analyses. Cluster 6 (G) in the 24 h dataset was merged with cluster 0 (A) after being identified as T REG . For 0 and 6 h aggregation analysis, 30 PCs were taken. Finally, cells were clustered using the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions in Seurat with a resolution of 0.6 and 0.2 for 6 and 0 h aggregation and 24 h, respectively. Further visualizations of exported normalized data such as UMAP or “violin” plots were generated using the Seurat package and custom R scripts. Violin shape represents the distribution of cell expressing transcript of interest (based on a Gaussian Kernel density estimation model) and are colored according to the percentage of cells expressing the transcript of interest.
Pairwise single-cell differential gene expression analysis was performed using the MAST package in R (v1.8.2) ( Finak et al., 2015 16. Finak, G. ∙ McDavid, A. ∙ Yajima, M. ... MAST: a flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing data Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :278 Crossref Scopus (1478) PubMed Google Scholar ) after conversion of data to log 2 counts per million (log 2 (CPM + 1)). A gene was considered differentially expressed when Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P -value was < 0.05 and a log 2 fold change was more than 0.25. For finding cluster markers (transcripts enriched in a given cluster) the function FindAllMarkers from Seurat was used.
GSEA scores were calculated with the package fgsea in R using the signal-to-noise ratio (or the log 2 fold change for cluster 5 versus cluster 0 comparison) as a metric. Gene sets were limited by minSize = 3 and maxSize = 500. Normalized enrichment scores were presented as GSEA plots. Signature module scores were calculated with AddModuleScore function, using default settings in Seurat. Briefly, for each cell, the score is defined by the mean of the signature gene list after the mean expression of an aggregate of control gene lists is subtracted. Control gene lists were sampled (same size as the signature list) from bins created based on the level of expression of the signature gene list. Gene lists used for analysis are provided in Table S2H.
The “branched” trajectory was constructed using Monocle 3 (v0.2.1, default settings) ( Trapnell et al., 2014 50. Trapnell, C. ∙ Cacchiarelli, D. ∙ Grimsby, J. ... The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells Nat Biotechnol. 2014; 32 :381-386 Crossref Scopus (3552) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the number of UMI, percentage of mitochondrial UMI as the model formula and including the highly variable genes from Seurat for consistency. After setting a single partition for all cells, the cell-trajectory was projected on the PCA and UMAP generated from Seurat analysis. The ‘root’ was selected by the get_earliest_principal_node function provided in the package. Monocle 3 alpha was used to analyze cluster 0 and 5 using the DDRTree algorithm for dimensional reduction after selecting the top 500 highly variable genes with Seurat.
Reads from single-cell V(D)J TCR sequence enriched libraries (Table S2D) were processed with the vdj pipeline from Cell Ranger (v3.1.0 and human annotations reference GRCh38, v3.1.0, as recommended). In brief, the V(D)J transcripts were assembled and their annotations were obtained for each independent library. In order to perform combined analysis of single-cell transcriptome and TCR sequence from the same cells, V(D)J libraries were first aggregated using a custom script. Then cell barcode suffixes from these libraries were revised according to the order of their gene expression libraries. Unique clonotypes, as defined by 10x Genomics as a set of productive Complementarity-Determining Region 3 (CDR3) sequences, were identified across all library files and their frequency and proportion (clone statistics) were calculated based on the aggregation result considering only the cells present in the gene expression libraries. This procedure was independently applied for data from CD4 + T cells stimulated for 6 and 24 h. Based on the vdj aggregation files, barcodes captured by our gene expression data and previously filtered to keep only good-quality cells, were annotated with a specific clonotype ID alongside their clone size (number of cells with the same clonotypes in either one or both the TCR alpha and beta chains) and other statistics (Table S4A,B,E and F). Cells that share clonotype with more than 1 cell were called as clonally expanded (clone size >2). Clone size for each cell was visualized on UMAP, depicting only SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells. Sharing of clonotype between cells in different clusters was depicted using the tool UpSetR ( Conway et al., 2017 11. Conway, J.R. ∙ Lex, A. ∙ Gehlenborg, N. UpSetR: an R package for the visualization of intersecting sets and their properties Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2938-2940 Crossref Scopus (1699) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, in order to assess the sharing between the 0- and 6 h datasets, the same aggregation process was applied for all of the vdj libraries from these data and only SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells specifically isolated from matched patients between sets were considered.
Processing of data, applied methods and codes are described in the respective section in the STAR Methods. The number of subjects, samples, replicates analyzed, and the statistical test performed are indicated in the figure legends or STAR methods. Statistical analysis for comparison between two groups were assessed with Mann Whitney U test and correlation assessed with spearman test with using GraphPad Prism.
