Title: Ubiquitination of DNA Damage-Stalled RNAPII Promotes Transcription-Coupled Repair


Abstract: Summary

Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is initiated by the stalling of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIo) at DNA lesions. The ubiquitination of RNAPIIo in response to DNA damage is an evolutionarily conserved event, but its function in mammals is unknown. Here, we identified a single DNA damage-induced ubiquitination site in RNAPII at RPB1-K1268, which regulates transcription recovery and DNA damage resistance. Mechanistically, RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination stimulates the association of the core-TFIIH complex with stalled RNAPIIo through a transfer mechanism that also involves UVSSA-K414 ubiquitination. We developed a strand-specific ChIP-seq method, which revealed RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination is important for repair and the resolution of transcriptional bottlenecks at DNA lesions. Finally, RPB1-K1268R knockin mice displayed a short life-span, premature aging, and neurodegeneration. Our results reveal RNAPII ubiquitination provides a two-tier protection mechanism by activating TC-NER and, in parallel, the processing of DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo, which together prevent prolonged transcription arrest and protect against neurodegeneration.

Section: Introduction

The timely expression of genetic information is crucial for life. However, genomic DNA is continuously damaged, and unrepaired DNA lesions interfere with transcription ( Jackson and Bartek, 2009 20. Jackson, S.P. ∙ Bartek, J. The DNA-damage response in human biology and disease Nature. 2009; 461 :1071-1078 Crossref Scopus (4432) PubMed Google Scholar ). Eukaryotic cells preferentially remove DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) ( Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008 17. Hanawalt, P.C. ∙ Spivak, G. Transcription-coupled DNA repair: two decades of progress and surprises Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :958-970 Crossref Scopus (826) PubMed Google Scholar ). By preventing prolonged stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at DNA lesions ( Brueckner et al., 2007 8. Brueckner, F. ∙ Hennecke, U. ∙ Carell, T. ... CPD damage recognition by transcribing RNA polymerase II Science. 2007; 315 :859-862 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), TC-NER ensures swift transcription recovery and avoids apoptosis. Individuals suffering from Cockayne syndrome (CS) have defective TC-NER due to mutations in either the CSA / ERCC8 or the CSB / ERCC6 gene and display developmental abnormalities, premature aging, and progressive neurodegeneration ( Laugel, 2013 27. Laugel, V. Cockayne syndrome: the expanding clinical and mutational spectrum Mech. Ageing Dev. 2013; 134 :161-170 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). These CS clinical features are likely caused by transcriptional misregulation of certain genes ( Wang et al., 2014 69. Wang, Y. ∙ Chakravarty, P. ∙ Ranes, M. ...

USA. 2014; 111 :14454-14459 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cytotoxicity associated with prolonged stalling of RNAPII ( Ljungman and Zhang, 1996; Marteijn et al., 2014; Reid-Bayliss et al., 2016; Yamaizumi and Sugano, 1994 31.

TC-NER is triggered by the stalling of elongating RNAPII molecules (RNAPIIo) at DNA lesions ( Xu et al., 2017 72. Xu, J. ∙ Lahiri, I. ∙ Wang, W. ... Structural basis for the initiation of eukaryotic transcription-coupled DNA repair Nature. 2017; 551 :653-657 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cockayne syndrome protein complex (CSA/CSB) as well as the UV-sensitive syndrome protein (UVSSA) collaborates in the processing of RNAPIIo and the recruitment of repair factors ( Nakazawa et al., 2012; Okuda et al., 2017; van der Weegen et al., 2019 41.

The sequential and cooperative action of CSB, CSA and UVSSA targets the TFIIH complex to DNA damage-stalled RNA polymerase II bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ). These events trigger the unwinding and excision of the lesion-containing DNA fragment, which is followed by repair synthesis and ligation to complete repair ( Aboussekhra et al., 1995 1. Aboussekhra, A. ∙ Biggerstaff, M. ∙ Shivji, M.K. ... Mammalian DNA nucleotide excision repair reconstituted with purified protein components Cell. 1995; 80 :859-868 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (765) PubMed Google Scholar ). A key event in TC-NER is the recruitment of the TFIIH complex, which is a general transcription factor that also functions in NER. However, it is currently unknown how stalled RNAPIIo molecules transmit a signal to recruit the TFIIH complex to initiate repair and to resume transcription.
One possibility is that the post-translational modification of stalled RNAPIIo is involved in this process. It was indeed described ∼20 years ago that the catalytic subunit of RNAPII (RPB1) becomes ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage in both yeast and human cells ( Gregersen and Svejstrup, 2018 15. Gregersen, L.H. ∙ Svejstrup, J.Q. The Cellular Response to Transcription-Blocking DNA Damage Trends Biochem. Sci. 2018; 43 :327-341 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Extensive studies in yeast S. cerevisiae have suggested that the ubiquitination of RPB1 is not required for TC-NER but rather acts in a last-resort pathway that regulates displacement and degradation of DNA damage-stalled RNAPII ( Lommel et al., 2000; Nouspikel, 2011; Somesh et al., 2005, 2007; Woudstra et al., 2002 32.

The last-resort pathway acts when TC-NER is not available to allow lesion removal by a slower repair pathway, such as global genome repair (GG-NER) without strand specificity. In humans, the mechanisms involved in the ubiquitination and processing of RNAPII are less well understood. Although several proteins have been linked to RNAPII ubiquitination in human cells ( Bregman et al., 1996; Ratner et al., 1998; Nakazawa et al., 2012; Kleiman et al., 2005; Starita et al., 2005; Yasukawa et al., 2008; Anindya et al., 2007 2.

In this study, we identify an evolutionarily conserved DNA damage-induced ubiquitination site at K1268 in the RPB1 subunit of human RNAPII; our results reveal that this single RNAPII ubiquitination promotes transcription-coupled repair and protects against neurodegeneration.

Section: Results

To identify damage-induced ubiquitination sites in human RPB1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), we performed a SILAC-mass spectrometry (MS) in UV-irradiated wild-type (WT) and TC-NER-deficient Δ UVSSA HCT116 cells. From the initial MS analysis, we only detected RPB1 ubiquitination at lysine 1268 (K1268) ( Table S1 ). We further performed label-free MS in WT HeLa cells after UV, which revealed additional RPB1 ubiquitination at K1268, K163, K177, K758, K853, and at K1350 ( Table S2 ). All of these RPB1 lysine residues have been reported as putative ubiquitination sites under various conditions ( Elia et al., 2015 11. Elia, A.E. ∙ Boardman, A.P. ∙ Wang, D.C. ... Quantitative Proteomic Atlas of Ubiquitination and Acetylation in the DNA Damage Response Mol. Cell. 2015; 59 :867-881 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, we only robustly detected ubiquitination at K1268 in response to a physiological level of UV-induced DNA damage ( Figure 1 A).
We generated 15 site-specific knockin mutants in which a single RPB1 ubiquitinated lysine was mutated to arginine (RPB1-KR mutants; Figure 1 A) of which 6 sites were identified in our MS, while 9 residues were reported previously ( Elia et al., 2015 11. Elia, A.E. ∙ Boardman, A.P. ∙ Wang, D.C. ... Quantitative Proteomic Atlas of Ubiquitination and Acetylation in the DNA Damage Response Mol. Cell. 2015; 59 :867-881 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). All KR mutants were successfully generated using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in HeLa cells except for RPB1-K758R ( Table S3 ). We next analyzed the UV-induced ubiquitination of the RPB1-KR mutants ( Figure 1 B). Importantly, the UV-induced RPB1-IIo top bands (IIo-Ubi) overlapped with immunoblot staining for conjugated ubiquitin ( Figure S1 A). Moreover, incubation of GFP-tagged RPB1, purified from UV-irradiated HEK293 cells, with the ubiquitin-endoprotease USP2 in vitro resulted in loss of the RPB1-IIo top bands and the appearance of cleaved mono-ubiquitin ( Figure S1 B). These findings demonstrate that these top bands truly represent RPB1-IIo ubiquitination ( Bregman et al., 1996; Nakazawa et al., 2012 5. Bregman, D.B. ∙ Halaban, R. ∙ van Gool, A.J. ... UV-induced ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II: a novel modification deficient in Cockayne syndrome cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93 :11586-11590 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Sasaki, K. ∙ Mitsutake, N. ... Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). While most RPB1-KR mutants still showed UV-induced RPB1-IIo ubiquitination, this modification was largely lost in RPB1-K1268R cells ( Figure 1 B). Notably, RPB1-IIo ubiquitination was also severely diminished in Δ CSB , Δ CSA , and in Δ UVSSA cells ( Figures 1 B and S3 A) ( Bregman et al., 1996; Nakazawa et al., 2012; Ratner et al., 1998 5. Bregman, D.B. ∙ Halaban, R. ∙ van Gool, A.J. ... UV-induced ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II: a novel modification deficient in Cockayne syndrome cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93 :11586-11590 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Sasaki, K. ∙ Mitsutake, N. ... Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Ratner, J.N. ∙ Balasubramanian, B. ∙ Corden, J. ...

Chem. 1998; 273 :5184-5189 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, these data indicate that UV-induced RPB1-IIo ubiquitination occurs predominantly at the K1268 residue. Interestingly, the RPB1-K1268 site is highly conserved ( Figure S1 C) and is surface-exposed near to where the downstream DNA enters RNAPIIo during transcription ( He et al., 2016 18. He, Y. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Fang, J. ... Near-atomic resolution visualization of human transcription promoter opening Nature. 2016; 533 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 D).
To address the importance of RPB1-IIo ubiquitination, we measured recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS) after UV irradiation, which is a conventional measure of TC-NER activity. While most RPB1-KR mutants exhibited only minor changes, the RPB1-K1268R cells displayed a prominent defect in RRS ( Figures 1 C and S1 E). Importantly, nascent transcript levels (general transcription) were unchanged ( Figure S1 F) in the RPB1-K1268R cells.
Clonogenic cell survival revealed an increased sensitivity to UV in most of the RPB1-KR mutants, while the RPB1-K1268R cells exhibited the most pronounced UV sensitivity among the mutants ( Figure 1 D). These results indicate that the ubiquitination of RPB1 at K1268 residue is important for transcription recovery and cell survival after UV-induced DNA damage.
To gain insight into the molecular events that mediate RPB1-IIo ubiquitination, we inactivated cullin-ring type E3 ligases (CRLs) with neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924 ( Soucy et al., 2009 59. Soucy, T.A. ∙ Smith, P.G. ∙ Milhollen, M.A. ... An inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme as a new approach to treat cancer Nature. 2009; 458 :732-736 Crossref Scopus (1549) PubMed Google Scholar ). MLN4924 treatment completely abolished the UV-induced RPB1-IIo ubiquitination, demonstrating that CRLs ubiquitinate the RPB1-K1268 residue ( Figure 2 A). MLN4924 treatment also diminished RRS in WT cells but not in TC-NER-deficient cells ( Figure 2 B), implying that CRLs play a predominant role in the RPB1-IIo ubiquitination associated with TC-NER activity.
We then studied the compositions of ubiquitin chains formed on the RPB1-K1268 residue. Ubiquitin pull-down assays confirmed the UV-induced ubiquitination of RPB1-IIo was severely reduced in Δ CSA HeLa cells and abolished in RPB1-K1268R cells ( Figure S2 ). These findings indicate that the ubiquitination of RPB1 primarily occurs on K1268 and is partly dependent on CSA. To investigate which specific ubiquitin chains are formed on RPB1-K1268, Ubiquitin-KR mutants (Ub-K6R, -K11R, -K27R, -K29R, -K33R, -K48R, and -K63R) were expressed in WT HEK293 cells, and ubiquitin pull-down was performed (K27R mutant was not included due to poor expression). Interestingly, we noted substantially reduced total UV-induced RPB1 ubiquitination and increased chain termination products when expressing either Ub-K63R or Ub-K48R ( Figure 2 C), suggesting that these ubiquitin linkages are primarily formed on RPB1-K1268. The presence of both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains were confirmed in GFP- RPB1 precipitates from HEK293 cells, and these were fully dependent on K1268 ( Figure 2 D). Notably, both K48- and K63-linked RPB1 ubiquitin chains were substantially decreased in Δ CSA cells ( Figure 2 D). Taken together, these data indicate that CRLs, including CRL CSA , conjugate K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains onto RPB1-IIo at K1268 in response to UV.
We next set out to define the molecular mechanism through which RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination regulates TC-NER. To this end, we monitored the association of TC-NER factors with ubiquitinated RPB1-IIo by chromatin co-immunoprecipitation (coIP). In WT HeLa cells, RPB1-IIo interacted with CSB and the CRL CSA complex as well as with major subunits of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) core complex and its associated CAK complex in a UV-dependent manner ( Figure 3 A). Intriguingly, while the RPB1-K1268R interacted normally with CS proteins after UV, its interaction with the core-TFIIH and CAK complexes were severely impaired ( Figure 3 A). Indeed, the UV-dependent recruitment of TFIIH to RPB1-IIo was completely abolished in Δ CSA , Δ CSB , or Δ UVSSA cells ( Figures 3 B and S3 A), consistent with recent results ( van der Weegen et al., 2019 68. van der Weegen, Y. ∙ Berman, H.G. ∙ Mevissen, T.E.T. ... The sequential and cooperative action of CSB, CSA and UVSSA targets the TFIIH complex to DNA damage-stalled RNA polymerase II bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ). Importantly, a UV dose-dependent increase in the TFIIH interaction was observed in WT cells but not in RPB1-K1268R cells ( Figure 3 C). TFIIH also did not associate with RPB1-K1268R at late time points after UV, suggesting an impaired rather than a delayed association ( Figure 3 D). Moreover, we detected persistent association of CSB/CSA in the RPB1-K1268R mutant at late time points after UV, consistent with defective repair ( Figure 3 D). We also noticed that the UV-dependent TFIIH interaction was mostly preserved in the other RPB1-KR mutants ( Figure S3 B). Of note, the TFIIH interaction required for the RPB1 C-terminal domain (CTD)-Ser5 phosphorylation during transcription initiation was normal in the RPB1-K1268R cells ( Figure S3 C), suggesting that RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination is specifically involved in engaging TFIIH during TC-NER but not during transcription initiation.
We next sought to address how RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination is mechanistically linked to the recruitment of TFIIH during TC-NER. We focused on UVSSA because it preferentially binds to ubiquitinated RPB1-IIo after UV irradiation ( Nakazawa et al., 2012 41. Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Sasaki, K. ∙ Mitsutake, N. ... Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). In WT cells, we detected the association of endogenous UVSSA with RPB1-IIo after UV, but this was abolished in either Δ CSA or Δ CSB cells. Conversely, Δ UVSSA did not affect the association of the CSB/CSA complex with RPB1-IIo ( Figures 3 B and S3 A).
We noticed a distinct UVSSA “mono-ubiquitinated” top band detected in RPB1-IIo immunoprecipitates after UV ( Figure 3 B). MS analyses revealed that UVSSA mono-ubiquitination occurs mainly at K414 (our unpublished data; Higa et al., 2018 19. Higa, M. ∙ Tanaka, K. ∙ Saijo, M. Inhibition of UVSSA ubiquitination suppresses transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair deficiency caused by dissociation from USP7 FEBS J. 2018; 285 :965-976 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mono-ubiquitinated UVSSA disappeared in RPB1-IIo immunoprecipitates in HeLa cells lacking the UVSSA-K414 residue (ΔK414; Figure 3 B). These findings identify K414 as the key mono-ubiquitination site in UVSSA in response to UV. Strikingly, the interaction between UVSSA and RPB1-IIo was significantly reduced in the RPB1-K1268R cells, and this particularly affected the mono-ubiquitinated form of UVSSA ( Figures 3 C and S3 C). Although difficult to detect, it appeared that general levels of UVSSA-K414 ubiquitination were mostly unaffected in RPB1-K1268R cells. Interestingly, this K414 residue is located within a stretch of acidic residues in the central region of UVSSA (390–430 aa), which directly interacts with the core-TFIIH-p62 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain ( Okuda et al., 2017 44. Okuda, M. ∙ Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Guo, C. ... Common TFIIH recruitment mechanism in global genome and transcription-coupled repair subpathways Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :13043-13055 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). To specify critical residues in UVSSA that mediate the TFIIH-p62 recruitment to ubiquitinated RPB1-IIo, we generated Δ UVSSA HeLa cells stably expressing the UVSSA-K414R, as well as the PH domain-binding site (PHB) mutants ( Okuda et al., 2017 44. Okuda, M. ∙ Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Guo, C. ... Common TFIIH recruitment mechanism in global genome and transcription-coupled repair subpathways Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :13043-13055 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). The UV-dependent TFIIH-p62 recruitment to RPB1-IIo was severely compromised in UVSSA -ΔK414 cells ( Figure 3 B), as well as in UVSSA-K414R cells ( Figure 3 E), indicating that the UVSSA-K414 ubiquitination is important for the TFIIH recruitment. As expected, the UVSSA-PHB mutants also displayed defects in the TFIIH recruitment ( Figure 3 E). Strikingly, while the PH domain-mediated UVSSA-TFIIH interaction was indeed impaired in the UVSSA-PHB mutants, we detected a normal interaction between the UVSSA-K414R mutant and TFIIH-p62 ( Figure S3 D). Importantly, RRS was impaired in all of the UVSSA mutants ( Figure S3 E), showing that the UVSSA-K414 ubiquitination and the TFIIH-p62 interaction are both critical for TC-NER. Notably, RPB1-IIo ubiquitination was restored to the WT level in all these UVSSA mutant cells ( Figure 3 E) despite their TC-NER defect.
These findings indicate that the damage-induced RNAPIIo ubiquitination mainly occurs prior to the recruitment of UVSSA and TFIIH, and that the ubiquitination of UVSSA-K414 is exclusively needed for the efficient transfer of TFIIH from UVSSA to stalled RNAPIIo ( Figure 3 F), which may involve later displacement of p62 by other NER proteins, such as XPG (xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group G protein).
To study the consequence of impaired RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination on a genome-wide scale, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation of RPB1 to capture DNA fragments, which were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]: Figure 4 A). This enables the quantitative and spatiotemporal mapping of RNAPII in the genome. We performed ChIP-seq in WT and RPB1-K1268R mutant HeLa cells using antibodies against total RPB1, or CTD phosphorylation-specific RPB1 ( Figure 4 A). Without UV irradiation, in agreement with previous reports ( Brookes et al., 2012; Odawara et al., 2011; Rahl et al., 2010 6. Brookes, E. ∙ de Santiago, I. ∙ Hebenstreit, D. ...

CTD-Ser2-phosphorylated RPB1 (RPB1-Ser2), which represents the elongating form of RNAPII, was distributed throughout gene-bodies and was significantly enriched after transcription end sites (TESs) due to post-transcriptional pausing prior to dissociation ( Figure 4 B, left panel gray lines). Total RPB1 ChIP profiles (pan-RPB1) were a composite of RPB1-Ser2 and RPB1-Ser5 features ( Figure S4 A, right panels gray lines). Importantly, all these RNAPII distribution profiles were identical between RPB1-WT and RPB1-K1268R mutant in undamaged cells ( Figures 4 B and S4 A), demonstrating that RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination does not affect general transcription.
At 3 h after UV, the distribution of RNAPII was comparable between RPB1-WT and RPB1-K1268R and significantly shifted with increased enrichment near the 3′ of TSS concomitant with a reduction at post-transcriptional pausing sites (PTPSs) after the TES ( Figure 4 B, green lines). This suggests that fewer RNAPII molecules reach the end of genes due to DNA damage-induced transcription arrest, stalling or pausing, in agreement with previous analyses ( Paulsen et al., 2014 46. Paulsen, M.T. ∙ Veloso, A. ∙ Prasad, J. ... Use of Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq for genome-wide assessment of the synthesis and stability of RNA Methods. 2014; 67 :45-54 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, while the RNAPII distribution started to shift back at 12 h after UV in WT cells, the RPB1-K1268R mutant showed impaired transcription recovery ( Figure 4 C). These profile differences were also prominent in individual genes ( Figure 4 D). Importantly, TC-NER-deficient cells showed a similar RNAPII distribution to the K1268R mutant at all time points analyzed except 3 h ( Figures S4 A and S4B; see arrows in RPB1-Ser2 3 h panels), suggesting this reflects the degree of impaired TC-NER.
We next sought to establish a new ChIP-seq method measuring genome-wide TC-NER kinetics. This method relies on the principle that a fraction of the DNA fragments prepared after RPB1-Ser2 ChIP contain DNA lesions in the transcribed strand, which caused RNAPIIo to stall in the first place. These DNA lesions will prevent PCR amplification during the generation of NGS libraries. However, the asymmetric structure of the Illumina library adapters ( Figure 4 E, left panel) allows the strand-specific PCR amplification of fragments without DNA damage resulting in the enrichment of reads in the coding (non-transcribed) strands. Indeed, a shift in strand-biased ChIP-seq reads was clearly detected in UV irradiated samples, and this strongly correlated with gene orientation ( Figure 4 E, top-right panel).
To estimate gene-by-gene repair kinetics from the strand-biased ChIP-seq data, we calculated the strand-specificity index (SSI), which reflects the degree of remaining DNA damage in transcribed strands in individual genes (see STAR Methods ). Transcription arrests at DNA lesions in gene bodies contribute to an increase in the absolute values of SSI (|SSI|), whereas RNAPIIo molecules pause after transcription at the PTPSs do not ( Figure 4 E, top-right panel). Plotting the SSI against the read coverage within “gene bodies” in individual “active genes” (9,836 genes, Figure S4 C) revealed a unimodal distribution in undamaged HeLa cells (no strand-bias) ( Figure 4 E, bottom-right panel). Conversely, UV irradiation triggers a bimodal SSI distribution due to bidirectional transcription and the stalling of RNAPIIo. Importantly, treating ChIPed DNA fragments from UV-irradiated cells with a DNA repair enzyme mix (preCR, NEB) prior to library preparation fully reverted the bimodal SSI pattern to a unimodal distribution ( Figure 4 F). Thus, the strand specificity is a true consequence of the presence of UV-induced DNA lesions.
We calculated the SSI to evaluate the impact of RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination on DNA repair kinetics in individual genes. In WT cells, SSI plots shifted to a bimodal distribution at 3 h post-UV irradiation, which returned to a unimodal distribution within 12 h, indicating completion of DNA repair within this time frame in “most genes” ( Figure 4 G, WT, red). In contrast, the bimodal distribution remained in the RPB1-K1268R mutant up to 12 h after UV, reflecting a significant delay in the genome-wide removal of DNA lesions by TC-NER ( Figure 4 G, K1268R, blue). To further support this conclusion, we calculated the SSI in TC-NER-deficient cells. Importantly, we first confirmed that the RPB1-Ser2 ChIP-seq read depths of individual genes showed a good correlation between biological replicates in all tested cells ( Figure S4 D). Indeed, all of these TC-NER-deficient cells displayed a bimodal distribution of SSI at 12 h after UV, indicating impaired removal of DNA lesions in most genes in these cells ( Figure S4 E). In conclusion, our genome-wide analysis supports an important role for RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination in TC-NER-mediated clearing of DNA lesions from transcribed-strands of active genes. In principle, this method can also be applied for the detection of genome-wide RNAPII molecules stalled at various types of other transcription-blocking DNA lesions, such as cisplatin and Illudin S.
Our strand-specific ChIP-seq method overcomes known limitations in conventional methods ( Mayer et al., 2017 34. Mayer, A. ∙ Landry, H.M. ∙ Churchman, L.S. Pause & go: from the discovery of RNA polymerase pausing to its functional implications Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2017; 46 :72-80 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ) and enable the evaluation of gene-by-gene repair kinetics. Indeed, analysis of individual genes (see MCM3 in Figure 5 A) revealed slower repair kinetics in RPB1-K1268R cells compared to WT.
To extend our gene-by-gene analysis further, we calculated the recovery index (RI), which represents the progression of DNA lesion removal from transcribed-strands in the entire genome (see STAR Methods and Figure S5 A). To exclude the effects of RNAPII pausing near TSSs, TESs, and PTPSs, from now on we focused on the “central genic region” in 5,704 active genes. This selection from 5 kb downstream of the TSS to 5 kb upstream of the TES of >20 kb active genes did not affect the RI kinetics ( Figures 5 B and S5 B). After reaching a maximum at 1 h post-UV irradiation, WT HeLa cells showed a gradual decrease in RI within 12 h indicative of near-complete repair within this time frame. However, the RI remained high in RPB1-K1268R and TC-NER-deficient cells indicative of incomplete repair ( Figure 5 B). Surprisingly, Δ CSB cells displayed slower repair kinetics compared to the other cells, which possibly reflects slow repair of UV-induced oxidative DNA damage ( Menoni et al., 2018 36. Menoni, H. ∙ Wienholz, F. ∙ Theil, A.F. ... The transcription-coupled DNA repair-initiating protein CSB promotes XRCC1 recruitment to oxidative DNA damage Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :7747-7756 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RPB1-K1268R cells showed significantly impaired TC-NER activity throughout the genome albeit not as strong as complete loss of TC-NER.
As the average transcription speed is estimated to be ∼2.5 kb per min and 7 J/m 2 UV irradiation triggers ∼1 lesion per 10 kb, it would be expected that all sparsely running RNAPIIo reach DNA lesions within the first ∼10 min post-UV irradiation. However, the RI increases in the first 1–3 h, suggesting a slowdown of the transcription elongation rate after UV. The total number of reads did not decline after UV, while the strand bias increased in the first 3 h ( Figure S5 C), indicating that the RI kinetics truly represent progression of DNA lesion removal from transcribed strands.
We next examined the SSI across relative positions in genes. This analysis revealed that DNA lesions were uniformly removed from entire gene bodies in WT cells ( Figures 5 C and S5 D), suggesting that TC-NER is initiated simultaneously by sparsely running RNAPIIo molecules that stall at DNA lesions. Interestingly, the concordant increase of SSI was observed in all cell types at early time points post-UV irradiation ( Figure S5 D), suggesting that de novo collisions of sparsely running RNAPIIo with DNA damage continuously occurred within 1 h after UV in all cell types, while further stalling continues afterward in repair-deficient cells.
We next attempted a base-resolution mapping of DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo. UV irradiation predominantly generates transcription-blocking cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in DNA ( Friedberg et al., 2005 14. Friedberg, E.C. ∙ Walker, G.C. ∙ Siede, W. ... DNA Repair and Mutagenesis ASM Press, 2005 Crossref Google Scholar ). An abundance of mapped reads in the coding strands near A < > A dimers could indeed be successfully detected in WT HeLa cells after UV ( Figure S5 E), due to the stalled RNAPIIo at UV-induced T-T CPDs in transcribed strands. We further analyzed the RNAPIIo stalling at base resolution in TC-NER-deficient as well as RPB1-K1268R cells ( Figures 5 D and S5 F). Interestingly, we noted an asymmetry in the mapped reads near A < > A dimer sites in the coding strand (T < > T DNA damage in the opposite transcribed strands), suggesting increased accumulation of RNAPIIo at the 5′ compared to the 3′ lesion-proximal region in RPB1-K1268R cells as well as in TC-NER-deficient cells ( Figure 5 D). The increase of reads immediately adjacent to A < > A dimer sites ( h a : peak height at the damage site measured from the 3′ baseline) and that of the 5′ regions ( h b : height of the 5′, 500 bp upstream of the damage site, measured from the 3′ baseline) in the coding strand were quantified ( Figure 5 E). As h b reached its maximum at ∼1 h after UV in all cell types with a nearly identical profile ( Figure 5 E, dashed lines), this may reflect the “queueing” of multiple RNAPII molecules at the 5′ side of the T < > T dimer due to a “transcription traffic jam” right behind the RNAPII molecule that is stalled at the DNA lesion. The queue resolved swiftly in WT cells but persisted in TC-NER-deficient cells as well as in RPB1-K1268R cells, suggesting that RNAPIIo queueing and its resolution is associated with TC-NER activity and the processing of stalled RNAPIIo.
Analysis of SSI in individual genes exhibited a strong correlation between replicates both in WT and RPB1-K1268R cells at early time points (3–6 h) after UV irradiation in the entire genome ( Figure 6 A).This indicates that the TC-NER activity is not random but rather reflects a tight coordination between gene-by-gene transcription and repair. This correlation was reduced and stochastic events became more prominent at 12 h after UV, suggesting that random DNA repair by GG-NER dominates over TC-NER at this time point. Differential read coverage analysis identified genes that were left unrepaired (red dots in Figure 6 A). These analyses were also performed in TC-NER-deficient cells ( Figure S6 A), which revealed an overlap in the sets of unrepaired genes between cell types ( Figure 6 B). While there was only 20% overlap between all conditions (WT-KR-ΔTCR), which reflects “common unrepaired genes” between WT and repair-deficient cell types (KR-ΔTCR), there was about 80% (KR-ΔTCR) overlap between unrepaired genes among the RPB1-K1268R (KR) and TC-NER-deficient (ΔTCR) cells. Within these overlapping genes, ( Figure 6 B), we analyzed common features, such as gene length ( Figure 6 C) and GC contents ( Figure 6 D), as well as RPB1 ChIP-seq read density, a proxy to gene expression level ( Figure 6 E) of the individual genes. The common unrepaired genes (WT-KR-ΔTCR, blue) as well as the overlapping genes between the KR and ΔTCR (green) cells were generally long in size and exhibited low-GC content and low-expression profiles, while genes only detected in the ΔTCR set (yellow) had no obvious characteristic features to distinguish them from “promptly repaired” genes (pink, 2,005 genes outside the Venn diagram in Figure 6 B). Representative unrepaired genes in RPB1-K1268R cells are shown in Figure 6 F.
We further performed a gene-enrichment analysis on the identified unrepaired genes in RPB1-K1268R that were repaired in WT cells. We detected a significant accumulation of unrepaired genes in the “cell-cycle” pathway (KEGG pathway ID hsa04110, p = 5.60 × 10 −11 ; Figure S6 B), such as genes encoding CDK-cyclin, ORC, and MCM (see MCM3 repair profiles in Figure 5 A) complexes, all of which positively regulate the cell-cycle progression. These cell-cycle genes are relatively long (median length: cell-cycle genes, 36 kb; other genes, 22 kb; p = 7.69 × 10 −4 , n = 9,836, Mann-Whitney U test), which likely explains this phenomenon. Our analyses suggest a possible cell-cycle delay and subsequent permanent cell-cycle arrest, resulting in cellular senescence in RPB1-K1268R cells in response to DNA damage.
Having established a TC-NER-compromised cellular phenotype in RPB1-K1268R cells, we decided to examine the consequences of deficient RNAPIIo ubiquitination in a whole organism. We generated gene-edited mice with the RPB1-K1268R mutation. The RPB1-K1268R mutation was introduced into the Polr2a gene in C57BL/6 mouse by CRISPR/Cas9 (see STAR Methods ). Polr2a K1268R/K1268R (KR/KR) homozygous knockin mice were generated after backcrosses of heterozygous founder mice and their inbreeding, which were born with expected Mendelian inheritance ratios. Neither the Polr2a KR/KR homozygous, nor the Polr2a WT/ KR heterozygous mice displayed any remarkable abnormalities during the first year of farming. The mice are fertile and their weight and appearance are normal ( Figure S7 A; Table S4 ).
Indeed, in contrast to human CS individuals, TC-NER-deficient Csa −/− or Csb −/− mice do not show an obvious phenotype ( van der Horst et al., 1997 66. van der Horst, G.T. ∙ van Steeg, H. ∙ Berg, R.J. ... Defective transcription-coupled repair in Cockayne syndrome B mice is associated with skin cancer predisposition Cell. 1997; 89 :425-435 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). A similar situation is observed in Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway (FANC)-deficient mice, which do not develop FA ( Chen et al., 1996; Parmar et al., 2009 10. Chen, M. ∙ Tomkins, D.J. ∙ Auerbach, W. ... Inactivation of Fac in mice produces inducible chromosomal instability and reduced fertility reminiscent of Fanconi anaemia Nat. Genet. 1996; 12 :448-451 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Parmar, K. ∙ D’Andrea, A. ∙ Niedernhofer, L.J. Mouse models of Fanconi anemia Mutat. Res. 2009; 668 :133-140 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, strong features of FA can be revealed by the genetic deletion of the aldehyde-catabolizing enzyme Aldh2 in FANC-deficient mice ( Langevin et al., 2011 25. Langevin, F. ∙ Crossan, G.P. ∙ Rosado, I.V. ... Fancd2 counteracts the toxic effects of naturally produced aldehydes in mice Nature. 2011; 475 :53-58 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, clear CS-like features were reported in Csb −/− / Xpa −/− or Csb −/− / Xpc −/− double-mutant (DM) mice ( Laposa et al., 2007; van der Pluijm et al., 2007 26. Laposa, R.R. ∙ Huang, E.J. ∙ Cleaver, J.E. Increased apoptosis, p53 up-regulation, and cerebellar neuronal degeneration in repair-deficient Cockayne syndrome mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :1389-1394 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar 67. van der Pluijm, I. ∙ Garinis, G.A. ∙ Brandt, R.M. ... Impaired genome maintenance suppresses the growth hormone--insulin-like growth factor 1 axis in mice with Cockayne syndrome PLoS Biol. 2007; 5 :e2 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that increasing the DNA damage load due to GG-NER deficiency in Csb −/− or Csa −/− mutants now reveals a CS-like phenotype in mice.
In view of the above, we decided to generate Polr2a KR/KR / Xpa −/− DM mice to increase the likelihood of RNAPIIo colliding into DNA lesions during transcription and to reveal a potential CS-like phenotype. The DM mice displayed a remarkable growth retardation, low body weight, and prominent dwarfism ( Figure 7 A), although all the mice were born with expected Mendelian inheritance ratios. Littermates of these mice with other genotypes did not show any growth or neurological abnormalities ( Figures 7 A and S7 B; Tables S5 and S6 ), similar to what was previously reported for Xpa −/− mice ( Nakane et al., 1995 39. Nakane, H. ∙ Takeuchi, S. ∙ Yuba, S. ... High incidence of ultraviolet-B-or chemical-carcinogen-induced skin tumours in mice lacking the xeroderma pigmentosum group A gene Nature. 1995; 377 :165-168 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 3 months, the DM mice gradually lost their body weights, which eventually resulted in death at the age of 5–6 months ( Figure 7 A; Table S6 ). Although daily observations confirmed the normal intake of food and water by the DM animals, their lifespan and condition did not improve. At 4–5 months of age, skeletal abnormalities, such as kyphosis and abnormal gait due to hindlimb dystonia were prominent in the DM mice, some of which also displayed depigmentation as well as cataracts, similar to human CS individuals ( Calmels et al., 2018; Laugel, 2013 9. Calmels, N. ∙ Botta, E. ∙ Jia, N. ... Functional and clinical relevance of novel mutations in a large cohort of patients with Cockayne syndrome J. Med. Genet. 2018; 55 :329-343 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Laugel, V. Cockayne syndrome: the expanding clinical and mutational spectrum Mech. Ageing Dev. 2013; 134 :161-170 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 7 B and 7C; Table S6 ).
The appearance of gait abnormalities and clamping hind limbs became evident after weaning in all DM animals, suggesting potential abnormalities in the central or peripheral nervous system. No obvious morphological abnormalities were apparent in the cerebrum and cerebellum of 4- to 6-month-old DM mice, except their small size in proportion to their body size. Interestingly, however, significant activation of astrocytes was observed in DM mice, implying the possibility of neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex ( Figure 7 D).
The gait abnormalities and dystonia in the DM mice could also be explained by motor neuron-specific abnormalities. To monitor potential progressive motor neuron loss, we quantified the number of axons in the spinal ventral roots from DM mice, which showed a terminal phenotype (>5 months). We observed a marked increase in the number of degenerating axons in the DM mice ( Figure 7 E), although the overall number of axons displayed a modest decrease compared to control mice ( Figure 7 F). Immunofluorescent stainings of spinal cords from DM mice also detected the loss of motor neurons (green), as well as activation of microglia (red) and astrocytes (white) ( Figure 7 G). These observations demonstrate that motor neuron degeneration in the DM animals is a late-onset progressive event, which is highly reminiscent of the progression in human CS individuals. The progressive neurodegenerative phenotype of the DM mice underscores the importance of RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination in vivo and suggests that these CS-like aging-related phenotypes are best explained by a deficiency in RNAPIIo processing and prolonged transcription arrests under a high load of endogenous DNA damage rather than a compromised DNA repair activity associated with TC-NER.

Section: Discussion

Although the ubiquitination of RNA polymerase IIo after UV irradiation in human cells has been known to occur for a considerable time ( Bregman et al., 1996 5. Bregman, D.B. ∙ Halaban, R. ∙ van Gool, A.J. ... UV-induced ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II: a novel modification deficient in Cockayne syndrome cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93 :11586-11590 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ), the precise mechanisms and functions underlying this modification have remained unknown. Here, we report that a single DNA damage-induced ubiquitination site at RPB1-K1268 regulates both TC-NER and processing of DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo on chromatin.
DNA damage-induced ubiquitination of RNAPIIo is highly conserved from yeast to man. Elegant studies in the yeast S. cerevisiae have demonstrated that the ubiquitination of RNAPIIo by the Rsp5 and Def1 ubiquitin ligases is not required for TC-NER but rather acts as a last-resort pathway to remove and degrade RNAPIIo from DNA damage sites ( Lommel et al., 2000; Somesh et al., 2005, 2007; Woudstra et al., 2002 32.

A Rad26-Def1 complex coordinates repair and RNA pol II proteolysis in response to DNA damage Nature. 2002; 415 :929-933 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, we show here that RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination in human cells does directly contribute to TC-NER ( Figure 3 F). While the RPB1-K1268 site and its surrounding amino acid residues are highly conserved in animals and plants, this region is less conserved in S. cerevisiae ( Figure S1 C), suggesting that the primary purpose of RNAPIIo ubiquitination between humans and budding yeast is different. In contrast, the RPB1-K1268 site is fairly conserved ( Rpb1 -K1252) in the fission yeast S. pombe , which in many ways shows more complex genomic features also found in vertebrate genomes. Interestingly, an rpb1 -K1252R mutant in S. pombe showed increased sensitivity to the UV mimetic 4-NQO in an NER-deficient Δ rhp14 (human XPA homolog) background ( Figure S7 C). This is reminiscent of our Polr2a K1268R knockin mice, which displays a CS-like phenotype in an NER-deficient Xpa −/− background. These DNA repair-independent phenomena found in S. pombe and mice strongly suggest an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism, which underlies the resolution of transcription-damage collision by RNAPIIo ubiquitination at RPB1-K1268 (-K1252 in S. pombe ) under a high load of DNA damage.
The precise mechanisms involved in human RNAPIIo ubiquitination have been multitude and controversial. While earlier studies revealed that RNAPIIo ubiquitination is defective in cells deficient in CSA or CSB ( Bregman et al., 1996; Ratner et al., 1998 5.

Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our current study also implicated UVSSA in this process, perhaps due to its association with deubiquitinase USP7 and the CSB/CSA complex ( Fei and Chen, 2012; Nakazawa et al., 2012; Schwertman et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012 13.

Mammalian Elongin A complex mediates DNA-damage-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of Rpb1 EMBO J. 2008; 27 :3256-3266 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the HECT E3 ligase NEDD4 ( Anindya et al., 2007 2. Anindya, R. ∙ Aygün, O. ∙ Svejstrup, J.Q. Damage-induced ubiquitylation of human RNA polymerase II by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, but not Cockayne syndrome proteins or BRCA1 Mol. Cell. 2007; 28 :386-397 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ) have all been implicated in the UV-induced ubiquitination of human RNAPIIo.
Our findings reveal the near-complete loss of ubiquitination in RPB1-K1268R cells, suggesting that this lysine residue represents the main UV-induced ubiquitination site in RNAPIIo. The accompanying paper by Tufegdzic Vidakovic et al., 2020 65. Tufegdzic Vidakovic, A. ∙ Mitter, R. ∙ Kelly, G.P. ... Regulation of the RNAPII pool is integral to the DNA damage response Cell. 2020; 180 Published online March 5, 2020 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ) also underscores the importance of this RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination for a proper transcription shutdown and recovery in response to UV irradiation. Notably, we observed severely reduced ubiquitination in Δ CSA cells, as well as complete loss of this modification after treatment with MLN4924, which suppresses NEDD8 conjugation to cullin-ring type E3 ligases (CRLs) causing their inactivation. These findings suggest that the CRL4 CSA E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is a strong candidate to contributes to RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination.
The data presented in this study demonstrate that RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination is important for TC-NER. First, we show that RPB1-K1268R HeLa cells are very sensitive to UV irradiation and show an impaired recovery of RNA synthesis after UV. Second, strand-specific ChIP-seq analysis revealed that RPB1-K1268R cells showed significantly delayed removal of UV-induced DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Third, molecular analysis revealed that the recruitment of the core-TFIIH complex to DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo was significantly reduced in RPB1-K1268R cells, explaining the cellular TC-NER-compromised phenotype of these cells. This raises the question how RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination positions the TFIIH complex during TC-NER?
Our data support a model in which the association of CSB/CSA with DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo is not affected by RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination. In fact, the CSB/CSA complex facilitates RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination upon its association with RNAPIIo, possibly together with other CRL ubiquitin ligases. The recruitment of UVSSA to RNAPIIo is fully dependent on CSB/CSA. Strikingly, the RPB1-UVSSA interaction is enhanced by RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination likely through the ubiquitin-binding VHS domain in UVSSA, which is most striking for mono-ubiquitinated UVSSA at K414. Although UVSSA initially associates with the TFIIH complex through interactions with the p62 subunit, UVSSA is eventually ubiquitinated at K414 to stimulate the displacement of p62 from UVSSA, possible in concert with other NER proteins. These parallel ubiquitination events of RPB1-K1268 and UVSSA-K414 facilitate the transfer of TFIIH to the DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo ( Figure 3 F).
Our molecular analysis revealed that cells deficient in CSB, CSA, UVSSA, or RPB1-K1268 ubiquitination show a pronounced TC-NER deficiency. Strikingly, however, only defects in the CSA or CSB genes in humans cause the neurodegenerative disorder Cockayne syndrome (CS), which is characterized by dysmyelination, progressive loss of neurons, severe developmental abnormalities, and premature aging. Conversely, defects in UVSSA cause the mild UV-sensitive syndrome (UV S S) without devastating features seen in CS, implying that CS is not caused by compromised TC-NER ( Nakazawa et al., 2012 41. Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Sasaki, K. ∙ Mitsutake, N. ... Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our current findings shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of CS by revealing that Polr2a K1268R mice deficient in the DNA damage-induced ubiquitination of RNAPIIo show pronounced dwarfism, growth retardation, neurodegeneration, and short lifespan reminiscent of CS. This phenotype only became prominent in the DNA repair-compromised Xpa −/− background, which lacks both GG-NER and TC-NER activity but displays no obvious characteristics including neurological abnormalities, although Xpa −/− mice are skin cancer predisposed after UV irradiation ( Nakane et al., 1995 39. Nakane, H. ∙ Takeuchi, S. ∙ Yuba, S. ... High incidence of ultraviolet-B-or chemical-carcinogen-induced skin tumours in mice lacking the xeroderma pigmentosum group A gene Nature. 1995; 377 :165-168 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is in line with the absence of CS-like neurodegeneration in human XP-A individuals ( Brooks, 2008 7. Brooks, P.J. The 8,5′-cyclopurine-2′-deoxynucleosides: candidate neurodegenerative DNA lesions in xeroderma pigmentosum, and unique probes of transcription and nucleotide excision repair DNA Repair (Amst.). 2008; 7 :1168-1179 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, our findings strongly argue that CS-like features are not caused by defective TC-NER. Indeed, neurodegeneration in Csb −/− mice was also only observed in an NER-compromised background, such as Xpa −/− or Xpc −/− mice ( Laposa et al., 2007; van der Pluijm et al., 2007 26. Laposa, R.R. ∙ Huang, E.J. ∙ Cleaver, J.E. Increased apoptosis, p53 up-regulation, and cerebellar neuronal degeneration in repair-deficient Cockayne syndrome mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :1389-1394 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar 67. van der Pluijm, I. ∙ Garinis, G.A. ∙ Brandt, R.M. ... Impaired genome maintenance suppresses the growth hormone--insulin-like growth factor 1 axis in mice with Cockayne syndrome PLoS Biol. 2007; 5 :e2 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that this phenotype, in mice, is only unmasked by an excess of unrepaired endogenous DNA lesions ordinarily dealt with by NER. We have noted previously that CSA or CSB -deficient primary fibroblasts fail to degrade RNAPIIo after UV irradiation, while UVSSA -deficient cells showed swift degradation ( Nakazawa et al., 2012 41. Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Sasaki, K. ∙ Mitsutake, N. ... Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). This has led to a hypothesis in which a deficiency in RNAPIIo processing and prolonged transcription arrests in response to DNA damage rather than a compromised TC-NER activity underlies the CS-like neurodegenerative phenotype ( Nakazawa et al., 2012 41. Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Sasaki, K. ∙ Mitsutake, N. ... Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CS-like phenotype of the Polr2a K1268R mice fully supports this model. In addition to the intrinsic TC-NER deficiency, a failure to ubiquitinate RPB1-K1268 leads to a non-displaceable RNAPIIo molecule, which blocks accessibility of the DNA lesions to alternative repair pathways, like GG-NER, and causes prolonged transcription arrests. Indeed, aldehydes and cyclopurines are likely endogenous DNA lesions in the brain that block RNAPIIo progression and may strongly contribute to the CS phenotype in case RNAPIIo processing is compromised. This model provides an explanation for the different clinical features associated with TC-NER-deficiency disorders. Similarly, defects in processing of RNAPII at various types of DNA damage may contribute to develop neurodegenerative phenotype shared among genome instability disorders.

C57BL/6JJcl mice were purchased from CLEA Japan. All mice analyzed in this study were C57BL/6 background and were age/sex matched unless otherwise noted (age/sex of mice were described in the main text, figure legends, and in Tables S4–S6 ). Polr2a -K1268R knock-in mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology with the following reagents: recombinant Cas9, Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease 3NLS (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT, 1074181); guide RNA (gRNA), GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit (target sequence, 5′-TGATGAAAACAAGATGCAAG-3′) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A29377); ssODN: IDT 4nmol Ultramer DNA Oligo (ssODN, 5′-ATGCAGAGAAGCTGGTCCTTCGAATCCGCATCATGAACAGTGATGAAAACA [ G ∗ ] GATGCA [g ∗∗ ] GAGGTAAATGGTCTGAGACCCGGGGGAAATAAAATAGAATGGGA-3′) (IDT). To design gRNA sequence, CRISPRdirect ( Naito et al., 2015 38. Naito, Y. ∙ Hino, K. ∙ Bono, H. ... CRISPRdirect: software for designing CRISPR/Cas guide RNA with reduced off-target sites Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :1120-1123 Crossref Scopus (847) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CRISPOR ( Haeussler et al., 2016 16.

Pronuclear-stage mouse embryos were prepared by thawing frozen embryos (CLEA Japan), and cultured in a KSOM medium (ARK Resource, KSOM). For EL, 100-150 embryos at 1 h after thawing were placed into a chamber with 40 μL of serum free media (Opti-MEM I, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31985062) containing 100 ng/μl Cas9 protein, 200 ng/μl gRNA, and 300 ng/μl ssODN. They were electroporated with a 5mm gap electrode (NepaGene, CUY505P5) in a NEPA21 Super Electroporator (Nepa Gene). The poring pulses for the electroporation were voltage 225 V, pulse width 1ms for mouse embryos, pulse interval 50 ms, and number of pulses 4. The first and second transfer pulses were voltage 20 V, pulse width 50 ms, pulse interval 50 ms, and number of pulses 5. Mouse embryos that developed to the two-cell stage after the electroporation were transferred into the oviducts of female surrogates anesthetised with sevoflurane (Mylan, 1900AMX00269). The animals were kept under conditions of 50% humidity and a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. They were fed a standard pellet diet (Oriental Yeast, MF) and tap water ad libitum , unless otherwise noted. Mice strains described in this study were obtained from the crossbred littermates. DM mice were supplied with gelled water and softened food pellets, to exclude the possibility that the inability to feed causes these phenotypes. All the animal studies were conducted in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. The experiments using genetically modified mice were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee and the recombinant DNA experiment committee of Nagoya University and Osaka University.
Standard S. pombe genetics and molecular biology techniques were employed as described previously ( Moreno et al., 1991 37. Moreno, S. ∙ Klar, A. ∙ Nurse, P. Molecular genetic analysis of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 :795-823 Crossref Scopus (3288) PubMed Google Scholar ). rpb1 -K1252R cells were constructed by replacing the endogenous rpb1 on S. pombe (501) genome with the sequence of the mutated rpb1 gene based on the Cre-loxP method ( Watson et al., 2008 70. Watson, A.T. ∙ Garcia, V. ∙ Bone, N. ... Gene tagging and gene replacement using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Gene. 2008; 407 :63-74 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rhp14 and rhp26 deleted strains were created by PCR based integration of NatMX gene as described previously ( Bähler et al., 1998 3. Bähler, J. ∙ Wu, J.Q. ∙ Longtine, M.S. ... Heterologous modules for efficient and versatile PCR-based gene targeting in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Yeast. 1998; 14 :943-951 Crossref Scopus (1870) PubMed Google Scholar ). The integration of NatMX at rhp14 and rhp26 loci was verified by PCR as well as their UV sensitivity.
To achieve NER gene knock-outs and the endogenous POLR2A gene deletion, as well as to generate RPB1-KR mutant cells, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing strategy ( Ran et al., 2013 50. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ). For a gene deletion experiment, a guide RNA (gRNA) coding sequence was cloned into px459 vector (Addgene, 48139). The plasmid (3 μg DNA per 1 × 10 7 cells) was transfected into designated cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11668019). 24 h after transfection, cells were selected for 48 h with 40 μg/ml puromycin (Nacalai, 29455-54) in DMEM (10% FBS). Single clones were isolated from surviving fraction by limiting dilution. Knock-outs were confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA and by the lack of designated protein expression by immunoblotting.
Generation of RPB1-KR mutants were achieved by inducing site-specific double-strand breaks near the designated RPB1 lysine residues in combination with homology-directed-repair (HDR) oligonucleotides carrying the KR substitutions. A ∼100 bp designated HDR oligonucleotide was co-transfected with a gRNA expressing plasmid corresponding to the target sequence. The introduction of designated amino acid substitution and the lack of wild-type RPB1 expression were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA, and RNA sequencing as appropriate.
All gRNA and HDR sequence information are listed in Table S3 . Experiments using RPB1-K1268R HeLa cells, clone #9 was used throughout the study unless otherwise noted.
Wild-type and Δ UVSSA HCT116 cells were grown for at least 6 doublings in DMEM for SILAC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11668019), lacking conventional arginine and lysine, supplemented with 10% dialysed FBS (SAFC Biosciences, 12117C), as well as unlabeled L-arginine and L-lysine (Light-wild-type, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89989 and 89987), or stable-isotope labeled L-arginine ( 13 C6- 15 N4) and L-lysine ( 13 C6- 15 N2) (Heavy-Δ UVSSA , Wako, 010-24041 and 123-06081). 1h after10 J/m 2 UV irradiation using a UV crosslinker (CL1000, Funakoshi) and a UV-fluence meter (UVP-97, Funakoshi), cells were lysed in Urea Lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 8 M urea, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM Na3VO4) with sonication (15 s, power 0.25%; TOMY, UD-211 homogenizer equipped with TP-040 tip). Protein quantitation was performed using Bradford Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, 500-0006), and Light- and Heavy-labeled proteins were combined in 1:1 ratio.
Protein samples were reduced with 5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R0861) for 30 min at 50°C, and subsequently alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide (Millipore, 144-48-9) for 15 min. The protein samples were then digested for 4 h with Lysyl Endopeptidase (Lys-C, Wako, 125-05061) at 1:100 enzyme: substrate ratio, followed by additional overnight digestion with trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 90059) at 1:50 enzyme: substrate ratio at 37°C. Digested peptides were purified using Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters, WAT051910). Eluted peptides were completely dried by lyophilisation. For the enrichment of diGly peptides, anti-ubiquitin remnant motif (K-ε-GG) antibodies conjugated to beads were used (PTMscan kit, Cell Signaling Technologies, 5562). The peptides were dissolved in IAP buffer (50 mM MOPS, 10 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.2), and the supernatant was incubated with one-half of the beads for 2 h at 4°C on a rotator unit. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated again with the remaining bead for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed twice with ice cold IAP buffer, and subsequently 3 times with ice cold HPLC-grade water. The peptides were eluted using 2 cycles of 0.15% TFA. Finally, the eluted peptides were desalted using C18 stage tips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 87782) and completely dried using vacuum centrifugation.
Peptide fractions were analyzed on Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) nano-HPLC, connected to Orbitrap Q-Exactive mass-analyzer system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source. Peptides were separated on a 15cm analytical column (75 μm inner diameter) with 3 μm C18-beads (Nikkyo Technos). Each peptide fraction was separated using a 135 min gradient ranging from 2% to 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The washout followed at 95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid for 20 min. Spray voltage was set to 1.8 kV, s-lens RF level at 50, and heated capillary temperature 250°C. All experiments were performed in the data-dependent acquisition mode to automatically isolate and fragment top10 multiply-charged precursors (+2, +3, +4 and +5) according to their intensities. Former target ions were dynamically for 15 s excluded and all experiments were acquired using positive polarity mode. Full scan resolution was set to 70,000 at m/z 200 and the mass range was set to m/z 350-1800. Full scan ion target value was 1 × 10 6 allowing a maximum fill time of 60ms. Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragment scans was acquired with optimal setting for parallel acquisition using 2.0 m/z isolation width and normalized collision energy of 28.
Mass-spectrometry was performed for UV irradiated HeLa cells cultured in standard DMEM. The wild-type HeLa cells were UV irradiated (20 J/m 2 ), followed by incubation for 1 h. Sample preparation and the enrichment of ubiquitin remnant peptides were as described above.
The data were analyzed using SEQUEST tool in Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and searched in the complete human proteome database (Swiss-Prot, SIB). The mass tolerances for the precursor and fragment were 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was included as a fixed modification, and N-terminal protein acetylation, methionine oxidation and lysine ubiquitlation were included as variable modifications. Peptide identification was filtered at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%.

Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were UV irradiated (20 J/m 2 254 nm UVC), followed by 1 h incubation unless otherwise noted. Whole cell lysate (for primary cells) was prepared by dissolving cells in SDS lysis buffer (0.2 M Tris HCl pH6.8, 10% Glycerol, 2.5% SDS, 0.1 M DTT). Chromatin fraction was prepared by extracting cells in isotonic extraction buffer, EB (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 ) with 0.5% NP-40 (Wako, 198596) and 5 × cOmplete protease inhibitor (Roche, 5056489001), for 30 min at 4°C (nuclear/cytoplasm fraction), followed by further 1 h incubation of the pellets with 100 U/ml Benzonase (Millipore, 70664) in EB buffer (chromatin fraction). Protein samples were resolved by 6% (Wako, 195-15171) or 5%–20% (Wako, 194-15021) gradient SDS-PAGE gels. The elongating form of RNA polymerase II (RNA polIIo, RPB1-IIo) large subunit (RPB1) was detected by immunoblotting with anti phospho-Ser2-CTD antibody (3E10, Millipore, 04-1571) against the Ser2-phosphorylated (phospho-Ser2) carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) heptapeptide (YS 2 PTS 5 PS 7 ) repeat (RPB1-Ser2), which is a marker of RPB1-IIo. 10 μM MLN4924 (ChemScene, CS-0348) / 0.01% DMSO (Sigma, D5879) treatment were performed 1 h prior to UV irradiation.

A semi-automated non-radioactive system for measuring recovery of RNA synthesis and unscheduled DNA synthesis using ethynyluracil derivatives DNA Repair (Amst.). 2010; 9 :506-516 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were cultured in DMEM (10% FBS) and plated in plastic 96well plates (Corning, 353072). Cells were UV irradiated (5-13 J/m 2 254 nm UVC unless otherwise noted), followed by 12 h incubation for RNA synthesis recovery. RRS levels and basal transcription were measured by the fluorescence-based ethynyluridine (EU)-incorporation assay ( Jia et al., 2015; Limsirichaikul et al., 2009; Nakazawa et al., 2010 21.

Concisely, recovered cells as well as non-irradiated cells were incubated for 2 h in media supplemented with 100 μM 5-ethynyluridine (5-EU, Thermo Fisher Scientific, E10345), followed by fluorescent-azide conjugation (Click-chemistry, Thermo Fisher Scientific): Cells were fixed and permeabilised for 20 min in PBS (Wako, 045-29795) containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing with PBS, cells were then incubated with coupling buffer with 10 μM Alexa Fluor 488 azide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10266), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 4 mM CuSO 4 , 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 30 ng/ml DAPI (DOJINDO, D523) for 60 min, followed by washing with PBST (0.05% Tween 20). Nuclear fluorescent image acquisition and data processing were automated with HCS Studio 2.0 software in the ArrayScan VTI system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The wild-type human UVSSA cDNA cloned into the pLenti6 viral vector was described previously ( Nakazawa et al., 2012 41. Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Sasaki, K. ∙ Mitsutake, N. ... Mutations in UVSSA cause UV-sensitive syndrome and impair RNA polymerase IIo processing in transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :586-592 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). The amino acid substitution mutants, K414R, F408A, and V411A, were generated from the wild-type UVSSA vector plasmid by site-directed PCR mutagenesis (this study and Okuda et al., 2017 44. Okuda, M. ∙ Nakazawa, Y. ∙ Guo, C. ... Common TFIIH recruitment mechanism in global genome and transcription-coupled repair subpathways Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :13043-13055 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). For lentivirus production, HEK293 cells were transfected with the UVSSA plasmids together with ViraPower Packaging Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K4975-00) using Lipofectamine 2000 (3 μg pLenti6-vector and 9 μg packaging plasmids mixture per 1 × 10 7 cells). Viral particles were collected 48 h after transfection and concentrated using PEG-it Virus Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, LV810A-1). For virus complementation experiments, those lentiviruses were infected into Δ UVSSA HeLa cells and surviving fractions were expanded with 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1113902) prior to RRS assay and immunoprecipitation experiments.

The wild-type and the RPB1-KR mutants, as well as Δ CSB , and Δ UVSSA HeLa cells were counted and plated into 6 well plastic dishes 24 h before UV irradiation. Cells were UV irradiated (1.25-5 J/m 2 254nm UVC) and incubated for 2 wk. Colonies were stained with crystal violet (Nacalai, 09803-62) and counted under a microscope (colonies with > 50 cells were scored as surviving fraction).
Plasmids harboring Strep-tagged wild-type or designated Ubiquitin-KR mutants (WT, wild-type; K null, no lysine residues; K6R, K11R, K27R, K29R,K33R, K48R, and K63R) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 and expressed in HeLa cells (wild-type, RPB1-K1268R, Δ CSA ) or in the wild-type HEK293 cells 48 h prior UV irradiation. Cells were UV irradiated (20 J/m 2 254nm UVC), followed by 1 h incubation before whole cell lysate preparation. 1.5 × 10 7 cells were suspended in 1 mL SDS-denaturing buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% SDS, 1mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 × cOmplete protease inhibitor), followed by sonication (15 s, power 0.25%; UD-211, TP-040 tip). Affinity purification was performed by incubation of the lysate with 30 μL Strep-Tactin conjugated Sepharose beads (IBA Lifesciences, 2-1201-002) for 6 h at 4°C. After extensive washing with the SDS-denaturing buffer, the beads were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer with 0.025% bromphenol blue (BPB). Ubiquitinated RPB1 was detected with the anti-phospho-Ser2 CTD 3E10 antibody. Total ubiquitinated proteins were detected with an anti-myc-tag antibody (MBL, M192-7).
A plasmid vector expressing the GFP-tagged α-amanitin resistant human RPB1 (GFP-RPB1) was a kind courtesy of Dr. Sugaya ( Sugaya et al., 2000 62. Sugaya, K. ∙ Vigneron, M. ∙ Cook, P.R. Mammalian cell lines expressing functional RNA polymerase II tagged with the green fluorescent protein J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 :2679-2683 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The RPB1-K1268R mutation was introduced into the wild-type vector plasmid by site-directed PCR mutagenesis. HEK293 cells expressing the GFP-RPB1 proteins (wild- type or K1268R mutant) were generated single clones were isolated prior to the experiments. Briefly, the GFP-RPB1 plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells and selected with 10 μg/ml α-amanitin (Sigma, A2263). Endogenous RPB1 (all) and CSA (if indicated) were then sequentially knocked out respectively by the RPB1- and CSA- targeting CRISPR/Cas9 constructs as described above. Cells were UV irradiated (20 J/m 2 254nm UVC), followed by 1 h incubation before cell lysate preparation. SDS-denatured total cell lysates were prepared using the SDS-denaturing buffer (1.5 × 10 7 cells in 1 ml) as described above and affinity purification was performed by incubation of the lysate with 20 μL GFP-Trap agarose beads (Chromotek, gta-10) for 6 h at 4°C. After extensive washing with the SDS-denaturing buffer, the beads were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer with 0.025% BPB. Ubiquitinated and unmodified GFP-RPB1 were detected with the anti-RPB1-Ser2 3E10 antibody, and with an anti-GFP, B-2 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-9996). Ubiquitinated proteins were detected with the following antibodies: P4D1 (Santa Cruz, sc-8017) detects total ubiquitinated proteins; Apu2 (Millipore, 05-1307) and HWA4C4 (eBioscience, 14-6077-80) respectively detect K48- and K63-linkage specific polyubiquitin chains.
Ubiquitinated GFP-tagged RPB1 protein (wild-type) was partially purified from UV irradiated (1 h after 20 J/m 2 ) HEK293 cells. Briefly, 1.5 × 10 7 cells were suspended in 1 mL EBC buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 × cOmplete protease inhibitor), followed by sonication (15 s, power 0.25%; UD-211, TP-040 tip). Affinity purification was performed by incubation of the lysate with 20 μL GFP-Trap agarose beads for 6 h at 4°C. After extensive washing with the EBC buffer without protease inhibitor, the beads were resuspended in 50 μL 1 × DUB reaction buffer with 1 × USP2 CD ubiquitin protease enzyme (UbiCREST Deubiquitinase Enzyme Set, Boston Biochem, K-400) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Cleaved ubiquitin and GFP-RPB1 were detected as described above.

The wild-type and the RPB1-KR mutants, as well as Δ CSA , Δ CSB , and Δ UVSSA (also including UVSSA-ΔK414, and Δ UVSSA complemented with lentivirus expressing UVSSA mutants) HeLa cells were UV irradiated (20 J/m 2 ) and incubated for 1h unless otherwise noted. Crude native chromatin fractions were prepared as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed for 2 h incubation on a rotator at 4°C with 1 mL chromatin lysate prepared from 2 × 10 7 cells and 2 μg of anti-RPB1-phospho Ser2-CTD antibody (Abcam, Ab5095) for RNAPIIo-Ser2 IP, Ser5-CTD 3E8 antibody (Millipore, 04-1572) for RNAPII-Ser5 IP, or anti-V5-tag antibody (MBL, PM003) for UVSSA-V5 IP. Immunocomplex were recovered by additional incubation with 20 μL protein A agarose beads (Millipore, 16-157) for 2 h on a rotator at 4°C. After extensive washing with high salt buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 2 mM MgCl 2 ), the beads were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer with 0.025% BPB. Interactions were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies listed in the following sections. RPB1 in the complex was detected with the anti-phospho-Ser2 CTD 3E10, and the phospho-Ser5 CTD 3E8, antibodies.
Sample preparations are described in the above sections. Whole cell lysates or chromatin fraction, as well as affinity purified proteins or co-immunoprecipitated samples (IP) were resolved by 6% or 5%–20% gradient-SDS-PAGE gels (50 μg/lane, 13 well mini-gel). Unless otherwise noted, resolved protein samples were transferred to PVDF membranes (PALL, BSP0161), followed by blocking for 24 h at 4°C in 10% skim milk in TBST (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in 5% skim milk in TBST (0.05% Tween 20) for 24 h at 4°C. Primary antibodies are listed in the Key Resources Table (concentrations are described in the following section). Membranes were washed three times in TBST (0.05% Tween 20), followed by incubation with 1:1000 diluted HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies: anti-mouse, 7076; anti-rabbit, 7074; anti-rat, 7077) in 5% skim milk in TBST (0.05% Tween 20). After extensive washing with TBST (0.05% Tween 20), the proteins were detected using Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer, NEL105001), and images were captured by ImageQuant LAS 4000mini (GE Healthcare). SMC3, PCNA, and RAD21 are loading controls.

RPB1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (RPB1-ChIP) was performed under following conditions: The wild-type, RPB1-K1268R, Δ CSA , Δ CSB , and Δ UVSSA HeLa cells were UV irradiated (7 J/m 2 254nm UVC), followed by incubation for designated time periods for the time course experiments. Cells were cross-linked with 0.5 mg/ml N,N’-disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, Wako, 041-32823) in PBS for 1 h, followed by incubation with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Double-cross-linked samples (1 × 10 7 cells) were then suspended in 100 μL ChIP buffer (0.25% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0), followed by sonication using Covaris M220 system (5% duty factor, 200 cycle, 960 s). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, supernatants were pooled as chromatin-input samples (input). Immunoprecipitation of RPB1 was performed with anti-RPB1 phopho-Ser2-CTD (RPB1-Ser2: Ab5095, 3E10), or -Ser5-CTD (RPB1-Ser5: 3E8) antibodies, as well as with an anti-total RPB1 (pan-RPB1: A304-405A, Bethyl Laboratories) antibody in 500 μL ChIP buffer containing chromatin-input corresponding to 5 × 10 6 cells, 0.1% BSA (Sigma, A7906), 1 × cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail, and 3 μg designated anti-RPB1 antibodies. Samples were incubated for 18 h, followed by affinity purification with 20 μL IgG/A-conjugated magnetic beads (Bio-Rad, 161-4833). ChIP elutes (UltraPure Water, Wako, 214-01301) and chromatin-input samples were proceeded to de-cross-linking / protease treatment for 4 h at 65°C in a buffer containing 200 mM NaCl and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K (Wako, 169-21041), followed by column purification (MinElute, QIAGEN, 28006).
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries were prepared from 1 ng ChIPed DNA samples using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, E7645S) and index primer sets (NEB, E7335S), unless otherwise noted. Strand-biased library amplification was performed using high-fidelity KAPA HiFi Enzyme (Roche, KK2102). The prepared libraries were sequenced under Illumina HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina), resulting in the production of 80bp single-end reads or 150 bp paired-end reads. Statistics of the sequence reads were summarized in Table S7 .
Alignment of the ChIP-seq reads was performed as follows: Low-quality sequence reads and adapters were filtered out by Trimmomatic (v3.36) ( Bolger et al., 2014 4. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (38307) PubMed Google Scholar ). The trimmed reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRC h37/hg19) with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-v0.7.12-r1039) ( Li, 2013 28. Li, H. Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA-MEM arXiv. 2013; arXiv:1303.3997 Google Scholar ). Biobambam2 (v2.0.72) ( Tischler and Leonard, 2014 64. Tischler, G. ∙ Leonard, S. biobambam: tools for read pair collation based algorithms on BAM files Source Code Biol. Med. 2014; 9 :13 Published online June 20, 2014 Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar ) was used to remove duplicate reads from the aligned reads. Sequence reads were locally realigned and base-quality scores were recalibrated with the IndelRealigner and BaseRecalibrator programs in Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK-v3.5) ( McKenna et al., 2010 35. McKenna, A. ∙ Hanna, M. ∙ Banks, E. ... The Genome Analysis Toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data Genome Res. 2010; 20 :1297-1303 Crossref Scopus (18073) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mapped reads were visualized with the Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV-v2.3.90) ( Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013 63. Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Robinson, J.T. ∙ Mesirov, J.P. Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV): high-performance genomics data visualization and exploration Brief. Bioinform. 2013; 14 :178-192 Crossref Scopus (5876) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reproducibility was confirmed by calculating read counts per million mapped reads for individual genes, and their correlation was examined between replicates ( Figure S4 D).
The sequence data were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA), with BioProject accession number, PRJNA548234 (see also Table S7 ).
For the preparation of DNA-repaired (damage-free) libraries, ChIPed DNA from UV-irradiated WT cells (3 h after 7 J/m 2 ) using Ab5095 antibody were treated with preCR enzyme mix (NEB, M0309S; a mixture of: T4 Endonuclease V, which cleaves cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers; AP endonucleases; Taq DNA Ligase; Taq DNA polymerase) for 20 min or 2 h, before Illumina library adaptor ligation.
From the aligned ChIP-seq reads, we generated meta-gene profiles to draw spatial distributions of RNAPIIo along gene bodies. Average numbers of reads per million mapped reads (RPM) within the gene bodies in 17,786 human protein-coding genes were counted with ngs.plot.r (v2.63) ( Shen et al., 2014 56. Shen, L. ∙ Shao, N. ∙ Liu, X. ... ngs.plot: Quick mining and visualization of next-generation sequencing data by integrating genomic databases BMC Genomics. 2014; 15 :284 Crossref Scopus (640) PubMed Google Scholar ) using proportional bins. The values were normalized by the coverages of background mapped reads within 20 kb to 15 kb upstream regions from transcription start sites.
We defined the strand specificity index (SSI) as follows: 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁡ ( 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐼 ) = 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑑 − 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑣 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑑 + 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑣 where fwd and rev respectively denote the numbers of forwardly and reversely mapped reads in a gene body. This index deviates from zero when RPB1-ChIPed DNA fragments in Illumina NGS-libraries harbor abundant DNA lesions in the transcribed strands, because of the asymmetric adapters and a biased PCR amplification for the coding strands without DNA damage ( Figures 4 A and 4E). Positive and negative SSI values correspond to the bidirectional gene-orientation. To calculate SSI, ‘first of pair strands’ in ChIP-seq mapped reads were grouped according to their orientation (forward, reverse) using the samtools (v. 1.9) ( Li et al., 2009 29. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38834) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, the numbers of forwardly and reversely mapped reads in the genic regions were counted using the BedIntersect program in Bedtool (v2.27.1) ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 47. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (15098) PubMed Google Scholar ). The representative RefSeq transcripts, the same dataset calculated for the meta gene profile, were used to determine the SSI.
For further analyses, we selected ‘actively transcribed genes’, which displayed sufficient read counts of RPB1 ChIP adjacent to transcription start sites (TSS). In this study, we chose 9,836 ‘active’ genes calculated from an pan-RPB1 ChIP-seq (see Figure S4 C). Scatterplots of the SSI against read density in individual genes were created using the SmoothScatter in R. We also analyzed the temporal changes of the SSI across relative positions within gene bodies. The entire genic regions were divided into ten sub-regions of 10% bin; for each bin, the median of the SSI was calculated as its representative value.
The temporal changes of the distributions of strand specificity across the active genes were monitored with the Recovery index (RI), a representative value of the SSI of individual genes. A distribution frequency of the gene-by-gene SSI may follow the Gaussian mixture model, comprising three normal distributions as represented by the following equation (see Figure S5 A), 𝑝 ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝜆 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑥 | ⁢ 𝜇 0 , 𝜎 0 ) + 1 − 𝜆 2 ⁢ { 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑥 | ⁢ 𝜇 1 , 𝜎 1 ) + 𝑁 ⁡ ( 𝑥 | − 𝜇 1 , 𝜎 1 ) } 𝜇 0 = 0 , 0 ≤ 𝜆 ≤ 1 where the two peripheral normal distributions were presumed to be symmetric with respect to x = 0. From this equation, we define the Recovery index (RI) as follows. 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑦 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑥 = 𝜇 1 This value denotes the distance of the peaks of the twin distributions from x = 0. The parameters of the Gaussian mixture model were estimated by employing maximum likelihood fitting with the fitdistr function in the MASS package of R.
We examined the enrichment of RNAPIIo molecules adjacent to T-T (A < > A in the coding strand) dimers (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, CPD; 6–4 pyrimidine–pyrimidone photoproducts, 6-4PP). ApA sites and franking 400 bp for both ends were extracted from the entire chromosome 1 of the hg19 genome sequence. Read coverages of each 5 bp bin were calculated with the computeMatix program in deepTools (v3.1) ( Ramírez et al., 2014 49. Ramírez, F. ∙ Dündar, F. ∙ Diehl, S. ... deepTools: a flexible platform for exploring deep-sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W187-W191 Crossref Scopus (1828) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the results were visualized with the plotProfile in deepTools.
We assumed a null hypothesis that the mapped read numbers in the coding and the template strands are not different. For every gene, the read number difference between the coding and the template strands were tested with edgeR v3.24.3 ( Robinson et al., 2010 54. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26703) PubMed Google Scholar ) with read count normalization by the RLE method. The analyses were performed for all cell types using two to four replicates and q -values ( Storey and Tibshirani, 2003 61. Storey, J.D. ∙ Tibshirani, R. Statistical significance for genomewide studies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9440-9445 Crossref Scopus (7565) PubMed Google Scholar ) were calculated ( q < 0.05 denotes statistically significant). Genes unrepaired in RPB1-K1268R cells but repaired in wild-type were subject to a gene enrichment analysis referring to the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway ( Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 22. Kanehisa, M. ∙ Goto, S. KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 :27-30 Crossref Scopus (23389) PubMed Google Scholar ). The analysis was performed using g:Profiler version e95_eg42_p13_f6e58b9 ( Raudvere et al., 2019 52. Raudvere, U. ∙ Kolberg, L. ∙ Kuzmin, I. ... g:Profiler: a web server for functional enrichment analysis and conversions of gene lists (2019 update) Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W191-W198 Crossref Scopus (3026) PubMed Google Scholar ).
CT images of animals were photographed (90 kV, 88 μA, FOV = 66 mm, whole body 8 s × 3 scans mode) using CosmoScan FX system (RIGAKU) under anesthesia with isoflurane (Pfizer,). Skeletal images were constructed using 3D Slicer software (4.10.2) ( Fedorov et al., 2012 12. Fedorov, A. ∙ Beichel, R. ∙ Kalpathy-Cramer, J. ... 3D Slicer as an image computing platform for the Quantitative Imaging Network Magn. Reson. Imaging. 2012; 30 :1323-1341 Crossref Scopus (5253) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Brains and lumbar spinal cords, dissected from mice transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (4% PFA), were post-fixed with 4% PFA for 24 h, followed by cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for 48 h (brains) and 24 h (spinal cords). The samples were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura finetek, 4583), followed by freezing at −80°C. Twelve μm cryosections were pre-incubated with in PBST (0.5% Triton X-100) for 30 min, followed by blocking with 5% normal goat serum (NGS, Cedarlane, CL1200) for brain sections, and 5% normal donkey serum (NDS, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, 017-000-121) for spinal cord sections, in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 h.
The brain sections were immunostained for 24 h at 4°C with a primary antibody against GFAP (1:500, Sigma, G3893) in 5% NGS in PBST, followed by 2 h incubation with a fluorescent-dye-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse 1:1000 (Alexa Fluor 546, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11030) IgG and 2.5 μg/mL DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, D1306) in 5% NGS in PBST at RT. The spinal cord sections were immunostained for 1 h with primary antibodies against ChAT (1:100, Millipore, AB144P), Iba1 (1:500, Wako, 019-19741), and GFAP (1:500, Sigma, G3893), followed by 1 h incubation with fluorescent-dye-conjugated secondary antibodies against goat 1:1000 (Alexa Fluor 488, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11055), rabbit 1:500 (Cy3, Jackson Immuno Research laboratories, 711-165-152), and mouse 1:500 (Alexa Fluor 647, Jackson Immuno Research laboratories, 715-605-150) IgGs and 2.5 μg/mL DAPI in 5% NDS in PBST at room temperature (RT). Coverslips (Matsunami Glass, C024601) were mounted with a drop of Fluoromount/Plus (Diagnostic BioSystems, K048) mounting medium. Images were captured using a confocal laser microscope (LSM700, Carl-Zeiss).
5 th ventral roots, dissected from mice transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (4% PFA), were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide (Nacalai, 25728-04) in HEPES buffer for 2 h. Dehydration was performed with a graded series of alcohol as follows: 30%, 50%, 70%, and 80% ethanol for 10 min on ice each, and then 90%, 95%, and 99.5% (repeated twice) for 10 min at RT each. After dehydration, samples were embedded in JB-4 (Polysciences, 00226-1). One μm sections were prepared with a microtome (Leica, RM2245) and stained with 1% toluidine blue in 1% sodium borate for 30 s. Coverslips were mounted with a drop of Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific, SP15-100) mounting medium. Images were captured using a microscope (Eclipse 55i, Nikon).
Exponentially growing S. pombe cells were sequentially diluted; 100 to 10-5 and spotted on plates of YEA containing indicated concentration of 4NQO (Sigma). These YEA plates were incubated for 3 days and scanned by ChemiDoc Touch MP system (Bio-Rad).
