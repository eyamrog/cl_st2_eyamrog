Title: The Intermucosal Connection between the Mouth and Gut in Commensal Pathobiont-Driven Colitis


Abstract: Summary

The precise mechanism by which oral infection contributes to the pathogenesis of extra-oral diseases remains unclear. Here, we report that periodontal inflammation exacerbates gut inflammation in vivo . Periodontitis leads to expansion of oral pathobionts, including Klebsiella and Enterobacter species, in the oral cavity. Amassed oral pathobionts are ingested and translocate to the gut, where they activate the inflammasome in colonic mononuclear phagocytes, triggering inflammation. In parallel, periodontitis results in generation of oral pathobiont-reactive Th17 cells in the oral cavity. Oral pathobiont-reactive Th17 cells are imprinted with gut tropism and migrate to the inflamed gut. When in the gut, Th17 cells of oral origin can be activated by translocated oral pathobionts and cause development of colitis, but they are not activated by gut-resident microbes. Thus, oral inflammation, such as periodontitis, exacerbates gut inflammation by supplying the gut with both colitogenic pathobionts and pathogenic T cells.

Section: Introduction

Recent accumulating evidence suggests a possible “mouth-gut axis” in the context of pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as colorectal cancer ( Garrett, 2015; Irrazábal et al., 2014; Said et al., 2014 31.

The oral cavity is a common site of extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD, especially Crohn’s disease (CD) ( Brandtzaeg, 2001; Brito et al., 2008; Lankarani et al., 2013; Lourenço et al., 2010; Van Dyke et al., 1986; Vavricka et al., 2013 13.

The prevalence of periodontitis is significantly increased in CD patients compared with non-IBD control individuals ( Brandtzaeg, 2001; Brito et al., 2008; Van Dyke et al., 1986; Vavricka et al., 2013 13.

Bowel Dis. 2013; 19 :2768-2777 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, SAMP1/YitFc mice, a murine model of CS, concurrently develop periodontal inflammation, and the severity of periodontitis correlates with that of ileitis ( Pietropaoli et al., 2014 68. Pietropaoli, D. ∙ Del Pinto, R. ∙ Corridoni, D. ... Occurrence of spontaneous periodontal disease in the SAMP1/YitFc murine model of Crohn disease J. Periodontol. 2014; 85 :1799-1805 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations suggest the possibility that the inflammatory processes occurring at oral and gut mucosae are somehow connected. However, the extent to which periodontal inflammation influences gastrointestinal diseases remains to be fully elucidated.
It has become evident that typical mouth-resident bacteria, such as Fusobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Veillonellaceae, are enriched in the mucosal tissues of IBD patients ( Gevers et al., 2014; Haberman et al., 2014; Schirmer et al., 2018 32.

Likewise, Klebsiella species, isolated from the saliva of IBD patients, have been identified as pathobionts whose ectopic colonization in the intestine elicits development of colitis ( Atarashi et al., 2017 9. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives T H 1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (586) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that the oral mucosa and colonic mucosa are physically connected, ingested oral bacteria likely translocate to the lower digestive tract, where they can elicit pathogenic immune responses. In addition to accumulation of pathobionts, bacteria-reactive CD4 + T cells accumulate in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients and are believed to play a central role in disease pathogenesis ( Calderón-Gómez et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2008 17. Calderón-Gómez, E. ∙ Bassolas-Molina, H. ∙ Mora-Buch, R. ... Commensal-Specific CD4(+) Cells From Patients With Crohn’s Disease Have a T-Helper 17 Inflammatory Profile Gastroenterology. 2016; 151 :489-500.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar 84. Shen, C. ∙ Landers, C.J. ∙ Derkowski, C. ... Enhanced CBir1-specific innate and adaptive immune responses in Crohn’s disease Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2008; 14 :1641-1651 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the mechanism by which these bacterium-reactive pathogenic T cells arise remains largely unknown. In this regard, it has been reported that the immune cells found in the oral draining lymph nodes can transmigrate to other lymphoid organs, including the gut ( Morton et al., 2014 58. Morton, A.M. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Upadhyay, R. ... Endoscopic photoconversion reveals unexpectedly broad leukocyte trafficking to and from the gut Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6696-6701 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is possible that oral inflammation gives rise to the emergence of oral pathobiont-reactive T cells. Pathogenic T cells then transmigrate from the oral mucosa to the gut, where they are activated by gut bacteria and cause intestinal inflammation.
Here we found that periodontitis aggravates gut inflammation in mice. Periodontitis induces expansion of Klebsiella / Enterobacter species in the oral mucosa. The amassed oral Klebsiella/Enterobacter species can translocate to the lower digestive tract and ectopically colonize it. Ectopic colonization of oral Klebsiella/Enterobacter species elicits activation of the inflammasome in lamina propria macrophages, which may compound their colitogenic capacities. In parallel, oral bacterium-reactive Th17-skewed T cells arise de novo in the oral cavity during periodontitis. Oral bacterium-reactive T cells are imprinted with gut tropism and migrate to the inflamed gut. When in the gut, the oral bacterium-reactive T cells are subsequently activated by ectopically colonized oral pathobionts and contribute to gut inflammation. Thus, together, oral pathobionts and pathogenic T cells, generated as a result of oral inflammation, exacerbate gut inflammation.

Section: Results

To investigate the effect of oral inflammation on gastrointestinal disease, we utilized a ligature-induced periodontitis model ( Abe and Hajishengallis, 2013; Jiao et al., 2013 1. Abe, T. ∙ Hajishengallis, G. Optimization of the ligature-induced periodontitis model in mice J. Immunol. Methods. 2013; 394 :49-54 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Jiao, Y. ∙ Darzi, Y. ∙ Tawaratsumida, K. ... Induction of bone loss by pathobiont-mediated Nod1 signaling in the oral cavity Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13 :595-601 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oral ligature placement resulted in massive alveolar bone loss 14 days post-insertion ( Figure S1 A). Oral ligation resulted in a transient spike of serum amyloid A (SAA), a non-specific marker of inflammation, 3 and 7 days post-placement, but systemic inflammation had resolved by day 14 ( Figure S1 B). No translocation of bacteria to the peripheral blood was observed ( Figure S1 C). In contrast, oral dysbiosis caused by oral ligation persisted ( Figure S1 D). On day 14 after oral ligation, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce experimental colitis ( Figure 1 A). Mice in the ligature-DSS group experienced significantly increased body weight loss and had higher disease activity index (DAI) values ( Murthy et al., 1993 60. Murthy, S.N. ∙ Cooper, H.S. ∙ Shim, H. ... Treatment of dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine colitis by intracolonic cyclosporin Dig. Dis. Sci. 1993; 38 :1722-1734 Crossref Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ) compared with the controls ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Likewise, mice in the ligature-DSS group displayed a greater degree of inflammation in the colonic mucosa compared with the controls ( Figures 1 D–1F). To further characterize the immune responses in ligature-DSS mice, we performed a comprehensive cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) panel for murine immune profiling ( Figure 1 G). We performed an unsupervised in t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)-based visualization (viSNE) analysis to reduce the dimensionality of data ( Amir et al., 2013 4. Amir, E.D. ∙ Davis, K.L. ∙ Tadmor, M.D. ... viSNE enables visualization of high dimensional single-cell data and reveals phenotypic heterogeneity of leukemia Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31 :545-552 Crossref Scopus (1211) PubMed Google Scholar ). We clustered immune subsets based on surface marker expression profiles and found that DSS treatment dramatically increased myeloid and lymphoid infiltration, as expected ( Figure S2 ). Interestingly, oral ligature treatment alone also enhanced immune infiltration into the gut lamina propria , including Th17 subsets, B cells, and γδ T cells ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). Notably, we observed a clear additive effect on expansion of resting and activated Th17 subsets (populations 12 and 14, respectively) in the group that received oral ligature and DSS treatment ( Figures 1 G and 1H; Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). To quantitatively validate the elevated numbers of Th17 cells, we conducted a conventional flow cytometry analysis. Consistent with the results of the CyTOF analysis, CD3 + CD4 + T cells were significantly increased in the ligature-DSS group compared with controls ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Further characterization demonstrated that RORγt + T-bet +/− Th17 cells and RORγt − T-bet + Th1 cells were significantly enriched in mice with ligature-DSS compared with DSS alone, whereas the abundance of Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) was unchanged ( Figures 1 K and 1L). Consistently, colonic CD3 + CD4 + T cells isolated from ligature-DSS mice produced significantly more interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and interferon γ (IFN-γ), but not IL-10, than cells isolated from DSS-only or non-colitic control mice ( Figure 1 M). These results indicate that ligature-induced periodontitis exacerbates gut inflammation with accumulation of Th17 and Th1 cells.
Next we analyzed the oral and gut microbiomes in ligature-DSS mice. As reported previously, periodontitis resulted in oral dysbiosis ( Figure 2 A; Figure S1 D). Enterobacteriaceae in particular dominated during periodontitis ( Figure 2 A; Figures S1 D and S1F). To identify bacterial taxa that are commonly found in the oral and gut mucosa in the presence of periodontitis, we performed linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis ( Figure 2 B). Interestingly, Enterobacteriaceae (OTU001), the most abundant bacterial taxon in the oral cavity during periodontitis, are also enriched in the gut of ligature-DSS-treated mice compared with DSS-treated mice without ligatures ( Figure 2 B). We further identified the species of Enterobacteriaceae that commonly colonize the oral and gut mucosae. We found that Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. were the most dominant species in the inflamed oral cavity ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Of note, gut colonization by these bacterial species was increased in mice with ligatures ( Figure 2 E). These findings suggest that pathobiont blooms in the oral cavity lead to accumulation of the same bacterial species in the gut. Notably, ligature insertion did not lead to gut colonization by these bacterial species in mice without DSS colitis ( Figure 2 E). This result indicates that the healthy gut microbiota prevents ectopic gut colonization by ingested oral pathobionts. Gut inflammation likely disrupts colonization resistance mediated by the resident gut microbiota, making it possible for oral pathobionts to colonize the gut.
To validate whether oral pathobionts can elicit pathogenic responses in the gut, oral microbiotas were isolated from healthy (healthy oral microbiota [HOM]) or periodontitis mice (ligature-associated oral microbiota [LOM]) and reconstituted in germ-free (GF) Il10 −/− mice. Over the course of the experiment, LOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice showed impaired body weight gain and increased fecal lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) levels compared with HOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Likewise, colonic inflammation was significantly exacerbated in the LOM group compared with the HOM group ( Figures 3 C–3E). Next, to identify the oral pathobiont strains responsible for induction of colitis, we generated synthetic microbial communities comprised of bacterial strains that represent HOM and LOM, respectively. In the HOM community, several strains belonging to the most abundant genera, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus (i.e., Streptococcus salivarius , Streptococcus sp. JS71, and Staphylococcus xylosus ), were isolated and then mixed to make synthetic HOM (sHOM). To make synthetic LOM (sLOM), several isolated Enterobacteriaceae strains (i.e., Klebsiella aerogenes , K. pneumoniae , K. variicola , Enterobacter cloacae , and E. hormaechei ; Figure 2 C), which are most prevalent in the LOM community, were mixed ( Figure 3 F). These synthetic bacterial communities, which mimic HOM and LOM, were used to colonize GF Il10 −/− mice. In GF Il10 −/− mice, sHOM and sLOM colonized equally ( Figure 3 G). As observed with HOM/LOM colonization, increased levels of fecal Lcn2 and exacerbated pathology were observed in sLOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice compared with sHOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice ( Figures 3 H–3J). Similarly, accumulation of Th17 and Th1 cells increased in sLOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice compared with sHOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice ( Figures 3 K–3O). These results suggest that ectopic colonization of oral Enterobacteriaceae can trigger colitis in genetically susceptible hosts.
Inflammasome-mediated secretion of IL-1β plays a central role in the pathogenesis of commensal pathobiont-driven IBD in mice ( Seo et al., 2015 80. Seo, S.U. ∙ Kamada, N. ∙ Muñoz-Planillo, R. ... Distinct Commensals Induce Interleukin-1β via NLRP3 Inflammasome in Inflammatory Monocytes to Promote Intestinal Inflammation in Response to Injury Immunity. 2015; 42 :744-755 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (268) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, patients with periodontitis have elevated levels of IL-1β ( Park et al., 2014 67. Park, E. ∙ Na, H.S. ∙ Song, Y.R. ... Activation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes by Porphyromonas gingivalis infection Infect. Immun. 2014; 82 :112-123 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with these observations, LOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice displayed more prominent inflammasome-associated molecular signatures (e.g., IL-1β) compared with the GF control or the HOM-colonized group ( Figure 4 A; Table S2 ). To identify the cellular source of IL-1β, we next explored IL-1β-producing cells in colonic lamina propria (LP) cells of sHOM- or sLOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice. As shown in Figures 4 B and 4C, IL-1β-producing cells were significantly increased in sLOM-colonized Il10 −/− mice compared with sHOM-colonized or control GF Il10 −/− mice. Most IL-1β-producing cells were identified as inflammatory macrophages (Ly6C lo MHC-II hi CD64 hi ) ( Figures 4 B–4D). Next we determined the extent to which IL-1β induced by gut colonization with oral pathobionts is involved in the pathogenesis of colitis. To this end, we used the DSS-induced colitis model in sHOM- and sLOM-colonized gnotobiotic mice and inhibited IL-1β signaling by administering the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. Similar to Il10 −/− mice, sLOM-colonized mice developed significantly more severe colitis when challenged with DSS ( Figures 4 E–4G). Anakinra treatment markedly attenuated colitis in sLOM-colonized mice, indicating the pivotal role of IL-1β in oral pathobiont-driven gut pathology ( Figures 4 E–4G). Next we validated the ability of each oral pathobiont strain to induce IL-1β secretion by macrophages. Oral pathobionts isolated from LOM induced robust production of IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and colonic LP cells, unlike those isolated from HOM. Of note, neither Enterobacteriaceae ( E. coli strains SK460 and SK461) nor other Gram-negative strains ( Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , B. uniformis , and B. vulgatus ) isolated from the gut were able to induce IL-1β secretion ( Figure 4 H). Consistently, colonization of these gut-derived E. coli and Bacteroides strains did not lead to development of colitis in GF Il10 −/− mice ( Figure S3 ). Thus, IL-1β induction capacity may be a hallmark of colitogenic oral pathobionts.
Although we showed that gut colonization by oral pathobionts could elicit development of colitis in gnotobiotic mice, it remains possible that this occurs only in the absence of commensal microbes with immune-regulatory functions. To determine whether gut colonization by oral pathobionts is sufficient to exacerbate intestinal inflammation in the presence of competing microbes, we exogenously colonized conventional specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice with K. aerogenes strain SK431, the most abundant bacterium within LOM, in the DSS-induced colitis model ( Figure 4 I). Consistent with the gnotobiotic mouse experiments, gut colonization by K. aerogenes worsened DSS-induced colitis in SPF mice ( Figures 4 J–4L). Anakinra treatment was able to reverse the intestinal inflammation that resulted from K. aerogenes colonization ( Figures 4 J–4L). These results imply that ectopic gut colonization by oral pathobionts, such as K. aerogenes , is sufficient to exacerbate colitis by activation of IL-1 signaling. We next determined which inflammasome proteins are involved in IL-1β induction by oral pathobionts. Induction of mature IL-1β secretion by K. aerogenes -stimulated BMDMs was diminished or reduced in the absence of Nlrp3 , Pycard , Casp1 , and Casp11 ( Figure S4 A). Given that caspase-11 acts upstream of the NLRP3 inflammasome ( Rathinam et al., 2012 69. Rathinam, V.A. ∙ Vanaja, S.K. ∙ Waggoner, L. ... TRIF licenses caspase-11-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation by gram-negative bacteria Cell. 2012; 150 :606-619 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (582) PubMed Google Scholar ), this result indicates that the oral pathobiont K. aerogenes likely induces IL-1β production via caspase-11-mediated, non-canonical inflammasome activation. The Aim2 inflammasome also appears to be partially involved ( Figure S4 A). Consistent with this in vitro observation, K. aerogenes colonization did not exacerbate colitis in mice lacking Nlrp3 , Pycard , Casp1 , or Casp11 ( Figures S4 B–S4D). Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are known to express various inflammasome proteins, including NLRP3 and caspase-11, and can produce inflammasome-related pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-18 ( Elinav et al., 2011; Knodler et al., 2014 23. Elinav, E. ∙ Strowig, T. ∙ Kau, A.L. ... NLRP6 inflammasome regulates colonic microbial ecology and risk for colitis Cell. 2011; 145 :745-757 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1624) PubMed Google Scholar 49. Knodler, L.A. ∙ Crowley, S.M. ∙ Sham, H.P. ... Noncanonical inflammasome activation of caspase-4/caspase-11 mediates epithelial defenses against enteric bacterial pathogens Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16 :249-256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although IECs mainly produce IL-18 as a result of inflammasome activation and are not likely a source of IL-1β ( Knodler et al., 2014 49. Knodler, L.A. ∙ Crowley, S.M. ∙ Sham, H.P. ... Noncanonical inflammasome activation of caspase-4/caspase-11 mediates epithelial defenses against enteric bacterial pathogens Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16 :249-256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ), it has been reported that IECs can secrete mature IL-1β ( Liu et al., 2017 51. Liu, L. ∙ Dong, Y. ∙ Ye, M. ... The Pathogenic Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases of Both Mice and Humans J. Crohn’s Colitis. 2017; 11 :737-750 PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, oral pathobionts may activate the inflammasomes in IECs as well as macrophages. To address this possibility, we stimulated human cancer-derived IEC line T84 cells and primary mouse colonoids with oral pathobionts and symbionts. As a positive control, we used Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which is known to activate the inflammasome in IECs ( Knodler et al., 2014 49. Knodler, L.A. ∙ Crowley, S.M. ∙ Sham, H.P. ... Noncanonical inflammasome activation of caspase-4/caspase-11 mediates epithelial defenses against enteric bacterial pathogens Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16 :249-256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (343) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike macrophages, none of the bacterial strains, except Salmonella , induced secretion of mature IL-1β or IL-18 from T84 cells or mouse colonoids ( Figures S4 E–S4G). Taken together, oral pathobionts, such as K. aerogenes , upon gut colonization, enhance intestinal inflammation through activation of inflammasome-mediated IL-1 signaling in macrophages.
In addition to delivery of oral pathobionts to the gut, periodontitis could affect the severity of colitis in an immunological manner. In this regard, we found a significant accumulation of Th17 and Th1 cells in the colonic mucosa of ligature-DSS mice compared with mice with only DSS colitis ( Figures 1 G–1M). Because the acute colitis model may lack a sufficient time span to develop memory T cell responses in the gut, we hypothesized that these T cells arise in the oral mucosa and transmigrate to the gut. To address this hypothesis, we first characterized the immune responses elicited by periodontitis in the oral cavity. We found that CD3 + CD4 + CD44 hi CD62L − effector memory T (T EM ) cells accumulated in the cervical lymph nodes (cLNs), which drain the oral cavity following development of periodontitis ( Figures 5 A–5C). These T EM cells expressed RORγt + and produced robust amounts of IL-17A while producing limited amounts of IFN-γ and IL-10, indicating that oral T EM cells associated with periodontal disease exhibit a Th17 phenotype ( Figures 5 D–5F). To determine the antigen specificity of oral T EM cells, cLN CD4 + T cells were stimulated with oral bacterial antigen-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs). As shown in Figure 5 G, cLN CD4 + T cells isolated from control mice did not recognize oral commensal antigens, whereas cLN CD4 + T cells isolated from ligature mice responded to oral commensal antigens ( Figure 5 G). cLN CD4 + T cells isolated from ligature mice responded more vigorously to oral bacterial antigens isolated from ligature mice than those isolated from healthy mice ( Figure 5 G). To identify the specific bacteria that activate oral Th17 T EM cells, we used single strains of bacteria normally associated with a healthy oral mucosa, an inflamed oral mucosa during periodontitis, and the gut mucosa. Oral T EM cells were reactive to Klebsiella / Enterobacter spp., all of which accumulated in the inflamed oral mucosa ( Figure 2 C). In contrast, neither oral bacteria typically found in a healthy oral cavity nor bacteria isolated from the gut mucosa activated oral T EM cells ( Figure 5 H). These results suggest that periodontitis induces generation of oral pathobiont-specific Th17 T EM cells. Of note, generation of oral pathobiont-specific Th17 T EM cells during periodontitis was significantly blunted, but not eradicated, in IL-1R −/− mice ( Figure S5 ). Thus, oral pathobiont-induced IL-1β signaling may, at least in part, be involved in generation of Th17 cells.
Immune cells in cLNs are known to transmigrate to extra-oral lymphoid organs, including the gut ( Morton et al., 2014 58. Morton, A.M. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Upadhyay, R. ... Endoscopic photoconversion reveals unexpectedly broad leukocyte trafficking to and from the gut Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6696-6701 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, as hypothesized earlier, it is possible that oral pathobiont-specific Th17 T EM cells arising from periodontitis can transmigrate to the gut. Consistent with this notion, oral Th17 T EM cells express α4β7 and CCR9, which regulate T cell homing to the intestine ( Briskin et al., 1997; Johansson-Lindbom et al., 2005; Mora et al., 2003 14. Briskin, M. ∙ Winsor-Hines, D. ∙ Shyjan, A. ... Human mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 is preferentially expressed in intestinal tract and associated lymphoid tissue Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151 :97-110 PubMed Google Scholar 44. Johansson-Lindbom, B. ∙ Svensson, M. ∙ Pabst, O. ...

Selective imprinting of gut-homing T cells by Peyer’s patch dendritic cells Nature. 2003; 424 :88-93 Crossref Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S6 A and S6B). To evaluate the pathogenic capacity of oral Th17 T EM cells in the gut, we adoptively transferred cLN-derived T EM cells into gnotobiotic Rag1 −/− mice ( Figure 5 I). To this end, GF Rag1 −/− mice were reconstituted with sLOM or sHOM for 14 days ( Figure 5 I). No overt inflammation (fecal Lcn2) was observed as a result of colonization by either bacterial cocktail ( Figure 5 J). After 14 days of reconstitution, oral T EM cells (isolated from the cLNs of ligature mice) were adoptively transferred into gnotobiotic Rag1 −/− mice. Consistent with antigen specificity in vitro ( Figure 5 H), adoptive transfer of oral T EM cells elicited development of colitis in sLOM-colonized Rag1 −/− mice ( Figures 5 J–5L). In contrast, sHOM-colonized Rag1 −/− mice did not develop colitis as a result of adoptive transfer of oral T EM cells ( Figures 5 J–5L). Importantly, transferred oral T EM cells failed to expand in the colonic mucosa of sHOM-colonized mice, whereas these cells proliferated in mice colonized with sLOM, suggesting that antigen-specific expansion of oral T EM cells may be required for induction of colitis ( Figures 5 M and 5N). Consistent with this notion, oral T EM cells isolated from healthy mice, which do not react with HOM or LOM ( Figure 5 G), could not induce colitis in mice colonized with sHOM or sLOM ( Figures S6 C–S6E). Although oral pathobiont-reactive T EM cells exhibited Th17 phenotypes when they arose in the oral cavity ( Figures 5 D–5H) and expanded in the gut after transmigration ( Figures 5 O–5P), it remains unclear whether Th17 phenotypes are crucial for induction of inflammation after transmigrating to the gut. Hence, we used IL-17A-EGFP reporter mice and sorted IL-17A-producing T EM cells (EGFP + cells) and T EM cells that do not produce IL-17A (EGFP − ) from cLNs (day 14 ligature-induced periodontitis) ( Figure S7 A). Sorted IL-17A-EGFP + and IL-17A-EGFP − oral T EM cells were then transferred into Rag1 −/− recipient mice colonized with oral pathobionts ( Figure S7 B). As expected, transfer of IL-17A-EGFP + but not IL-17A-EGFP − oral T EM cells elicited development of colitis ( Figures S7 C–S7F). These results indicate that oral pathobiont-reactive Th17 T EM cells may contribute to development or exacerbation of intestinal inflammation when they were able to transmigrate to the gut.
To confirm transmigration of oral T cells to the gut following development of periodontitis in immune-competent animals, we used Kaede transgenic mice ( Tomura et al., 2008 87. Tomura, M. ∙ Yoshida, N. ∙ Tanaka, J. ... Monitoring cellular movement in vivo with photoconvertible fluorescence protein “Kaede” transgenic mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :10871-10876 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). All cell types in Kaede mice express the photoconvertible Kaede-Green fluorescent protein. When the photoconvertible protein is exposed to violet light, the protein changes its color from Kaede-Green to Kaede-Red ( Tomura et al., 2008 87. Tomura, M. ∙ Yoshida, N. ∙ Tanaka, J. ... Monitoring cellular movement in vivo with photoconvertible fluorescence protein “Kaede” transgenic mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :10871-10876 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). This tool can be used to track cellular movement in vivo by analyzing the expression of Kaede-Red fluorescent protein in the destination organ. We first examined migration of T cells from cLNs to the gut under homeostatic conditions. The cLNs of Kaede transgenic (Tg) mice were exposed to violet light. Then the presence of Kaede-Red + CD3 + CD4 + T cells in cLNs, mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), and colonic LP (cLP) was analyzed ( Figure 6 A). More than 40% of T cells in cLNs were converted by a short-term exposure to violet light ( Figure 6 A). Kaede-Red + cells translocated from the cLNs and were replaced by incoming Kaede-Green + cells within 7 days (steady-state leukocyte circulation), as reported previously ( Morton et al., 2014 58. Morton, A.M. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Upadhyay, R. ... Endoscopic photoconversion reveals unexpectedly broad leukocyte trafficking to and from the gut Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6696-6701 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 6 A). Kaede-Red + cells were detected in mLNs on day 7, whereas none of these cells were present immediately after (1.5 h) photoconversion ( Figure 6 A), suggesting that T cells in cLNs can migrate to the gut under physiological conditions. In contrast to mLNs, no Kaede-Red + CD4 + T cells were detected in the cLP ( Figure 6 A). Next we assessed the effect of gut inflammation on homing of oral T cells to the gut. Oral ligatures were placed into Kaede Tg mice, and after 14 days, the cLNs were irradiated with violet light, followed by DSS treatment 1 day later ( Figure 6 B). Neither ligature nor DSS colitis alone resulted in migration of orally primed T cells to the cLP ( Figures 6 B–6D). In contrast, increased numbers of Kaede-Red + CD4 + T cells were detected in the cLP of DSS-treated mice with oral ligatures ( Figures 6 B–6D). Kaede-Red + CD4 + T cells in the colonic mucosa showed predominantly Th17 (RORγt + and RORγt + T-bet + ) phenotypes and limited numbers of Foxp3 + cells ( Figures 6 E and 6F). Thus, orally primed T cells are capable of transmigrating to the gut mucosa.
To validate the colitogenic capacity of Kaede-Red + CD3 + CD4 + T cells in the gut, we purified Kaede-Red + CD3 + CD4 + T cells isolated from the cLP of Ligature-DSS mice and then adoptively transferred these cells into SPF Rag1 −/− mice ( Figure 6 G). Purified Kaede-Green + CD3 + CD4 + T cells isolated from the cLP of DSS-treated mice were used as a control ( Figure 6 G). Contrary to our expectations, adoptive transfer of Kaede-Red + CD3 + CD4 + T cells did not elicit development of colitis in SPF Rag1 −/− mice because fecal Lcn2 levels were not elevated during the 8-week period ( Figure 6 G). We theorized that this phenotype is due to the inability of the gut-resident microbiota to activate transferred oral pathobiont-reactive T cells. In other words, expansion of oral pathobionts in the gut is required for activation of oral bacterium-reactive T cells in the gut. We tested this hypothesis by colonizing mice with the oral pathobiont K. aerogenes , mimicking increased abundance of oral pathobionts in the gut. Based on the calculation that a typical person swallows an estimated 1.5 × 10 12 oral bacteria per day (1.5 × 10 12 /day/70 kg 0.53 × 10 9 /gavage/25-g mouse) ( Schmidt et al., 2019 77. Schmidt, T.S. ∙ Hayward, M.R. ∙ Coelho, L.P. ... Extensive transmission of microbes along the gastrointestinal tract eLife. 2019; 8 :e42693 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ), we inoculated mice with 1 × 10 9 K. aerogenes 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Gut colonization with K. aerogenes did not elicit gut inflammation (as measured by fecal Lcn2) in sham control Rag1 −/− mice or Rag1 −/− mice reconstituted with Kaede-Green + CD3 + CD4 + T cells ( Figures 6 G–6K). On the other hand, oral gavage with K. aerogenes resulted in development of severe colitis in Rag1 −/− mice reconstituted with Kaede-Red + CD3 + CD4 + T cells ( Figures 6 G–6K). Notably, the gut pathology of mice transferred with Kaede-Red + CD3 + CD4 + T cells was significantly attenuated by treatment with the IL-1R antagonist anakinra ( Figures 6 L–6O). This was accompanied by a reduction in the total number of CD4 + T cells as well as RORγt + and RORγt + T-bet + Th17 cells in the colon ( Figures 6 P–6S). Consistent with this result, secretion of IL-17A and IFN-γ by colonic CD4 + T cells was also decreased ( Figure 6 T). These results indicate that the population of oral microbiota-reactive T cells, which are enriched with pathogenic Th17 cells, could transmigrate to the gut. Upon arrival in the gut, oral microbiota-reactive Th17 cells may expand by reacting to their cognate antigens (i.e., ectopically colonized oral pathobionts), promoting development of colitis. Gut mucosal IL-1β induced by oral pathobionts may also be involved in activation and/or expansion of the transmigrated oral T cells.
So far, we have demonstrated that oral pathobiont-reactive Th17 cells that arise during periodontitis have a colitogenic capacity. However, the extent to which gut-transmigrated oral Th17 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of colitis remains unclear. To address this question, we used a parabiosis model. As shown in Figure 7 A, periodontitis was induced in CD45.2 + WT C57BL/6 mice (donors of orally primed T cells). After 14 days of oral ligature insertion, these mice were surgically connected to congenic CD45.1 + mice by parabiosis. After 1 week, colitis was induced only in CD45.1 + mice by oral gavage of DSS. These mice were also orally challenged with K. aerogenes to supply cognate antigens to gut-migrated oral T cells. CD45.1 + mice connected to periodontitis CD45.2 + mice (group 4) developed significantly more severe colitis compared with CD45.1 + mice connected to healthy mice (Group 3) when challenged with DSS/ K. aerogenes ( Figures 7 B–7D). In group 4 mice, we observed massive migration of CD45.2 + CD3 + CD4 + T cells (derived from connected periodontitis mice) into the colonic mucosa of CD45.1 + mice ( Figures 7 B–7D). These gut-migrated T cells, which are derived from periodontitis mice, revealed RORγt + and RORγt + T-bet + Th17 cell phenotypes and, indeed, produced robust amounts of IL-17A and IFN-γ ( Figures 7 E–7J). Importantly, the connection to periodontitis mice did not worsen DSS colitis nor increase gut migration of Th17 cells associated with periodontitis mice when K. aerogenes was not supplied (group 5), indicating that the presence of oral pathobionts in the gut is a prerequisite for expansion of orally primed Th17 cells and the subsequent induction of intestinal inflammation by these cells in the gut ( Figures 7 B–7J).

Section: Discussion

In this study, we found that periodontal inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD. Inflammation in the oral mucosa fosters blooms of Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp., and ectopic gut colonization of these bacteria plays a crucial role in exacerbation of intestinal inflammation. It is noteworthy that oral pathobionts do not colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals ( Figure 2 E). This evidence suggests that at least two conditions must be met for oral pathobionts to ectopically colonize the gut. First, the colonization resistance of gut-resident microbiota must be disrupted, enabling the oral microbes to invade the gut. In the current study, gut inflammation perturbed colonization resistance mediated by the resident microbiota, making it possible for ingested oral pathobionts to outcompete and displace the resident bacteria. Moreover, Enterobacteriaceae are metabolically adapted to thrive in the inflammatory milieu. Hence, intestinal inflammation favors the growth of Enterobacteriaceae, including bacteria translocated from the oral mucosa ( Kitamoto et al., 2020; Winter et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2018 47. Kitamoto, S. ∙ Alteri, C.J. ∙ Rodrigues, M. ... Dietary L-serine confers a competitive fitness advantage to Enterobacteriaceae in the inflamed gut Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :116-125 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar 92. Winter, S.E. ∙ Winter, M.G. ∙ Xavier, M.N. ...

Precision editing of the gut microbiota ameliorates colitis Nature. 2018; 553 :208-211 Crossref Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, loss of colonization resistance or gut inflammation alone does not facilitate ectopic gut colonization by oral pathobionts. The second condition that must be met is oral inflammation. There likely is a threshold for the number of ingested oral pathobionts that must be reached for them to successfully transition from the oral cavity to the gut. Periodontal inflammation is therefore essential because it raises the abundance of oral pathobionts and increases the likelihood of successful passage through the acidic environment encountered in the stomach. Alternatively, neutralization of gastric acid or inhibition of acid secretion could promote ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the gut. For example, it has been reported that use of proton pump inhibitors, which reduce production of gastric acid, leads to increased colonization of mouth-resident bacteria in the gut ( Imhann et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2016 39. Imhann, F. ∙ Bonder, M.J. ∙ Vich Vila, A. ... Proton pump inhibitors affect the gut microbiome Gut. 2016; 65 :740-748 Crossref Scopus (880) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Jackson, M.A. ∙ Goodrich, J.K. ∙ Maxan, M.E. ... Proton pump inhibitors alter the composition of the gut microbiota Gut. 2016; 65 :749-756 Crossref Scopus (615) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this observation, it has been reported that gastric acid inhibitors worsen clinical outcomes in IBD ( Juillerat et al., 2012; Shah et al., 2017 45. Juillerat, P. ∙ Schneeweiss, S. ∙ Cook, E.F. ... Drugs that inhibit gastric acid secretion may alter the course of inflammatory bowel disease Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2012; 36 :239-247 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar 82. Shah, R. ∙ Richardson, P. ∙ Yu, H. ... Gastric Acid Suppression Is Associated with an Increased Risk of Adverse Outcomes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Digestion. 2017; 95 :188-193 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Ectopically colonized oral pathobionts may be involved in exacerbation of colitis through the synergistic effects of two distinct mechanisms: activation of mucosal inflammatory responses (direct) and by serving as cognate antigens for transmigrated oral T cells (indirect). Inflammasome activation and subsequent induction of IL-1β by oral pathobionts likely plays a central role in the first mechanism; i.e., direct induction of colitis in the gut ( Figure 4 ; Figure S4 ). In parallel, ectopically colonized oral pathobionts are required for expansion of gut-transmigrated oral T EM cells, possibly through antigen-specific proliferation ( Figures 5 , 6 , and 7 ; Figure S6 ). Of note, these two mechanisms may act synergistically. IL-1β induced by ectopically colonized oral pathobionts may also contribute to activation and/or expansion of oral T EM cells in the gut mucosa ( Figures 6 L–6T). Thus, it is possible that prevention of ectopic gut colonization by oral pathobionts not only reduces the abundance of colitogenic pathobionts but also attenuates expansion of colitogenic T cells in the gut.
CD4 + T lymphocytes are believed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBD ( Neurath, 2014 62. Neurath, M.F. New targets for mucosal healing and therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7 :6-19 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). In IBD patients, Th1, Th17, or Th1/Th17 combined phenotypes of CD4 + T cells are found accumulated in the intestinal mucosa ( Calderón-Gómez et al., 2016; Hegazy et al., 2017 17.

These pathogenic CD4 + T cells are reactive to resident bacteria ( Calderón-Gómez et al., 2016; Hegazy et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2008 17. Calderón-Gómez, E. ∙ Bassolas-Molina, H. ∙ Mora-Buch, R. ...

However, the mechanism by which bacterium-reactive pathogenic T cells arise in the context of IBD remains incompletely understood. It has been reported that colonization by gut-resident microbiota elicits development of bacterium-specific tolerogenic and effector T cell responses. Specific gut microbes, such as Clostridium clusters XlVa and IV or Bacteroides strains ( Atarashi et al., 2011, 2013; Faith et al., 2014; Round et al., 2011 6.

Colonization by segmented filamentous bacteria (SFBs) elicits differentiation of RORγt + Th17 effector cells ( Ivanov et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2018 41. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Atarashi, K. ∙ Manel, N. ... Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria Cell. 2009; 139 :485-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3584) PubMed Google Scholar 93.

However, these SFB-specific Th17 cells are homeostatic effector cells and do not cause intestinal inflammation ( Xu et al., 2018 93. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gut colonization by a known intestinal pathobiont, Helicobacter hepaticus , results in differentiation of Foxp3 + RORγt + Treg and RORγt + Th17 cells ( Xu et al., 2018 93. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treg cells limit activation of Th17 cells under homeostatic conditions (in wild-type [WT] animals); hence, colonization by H. hepaticus fails to elicit intestinal inflammation. Thus, the gut microenvironment is conducive to development of tolerogenic immunity against commensal microbiota. Consistent with this notion, in this study, CD4 + T cells isolated from the colonic mucosa of mice with acute DSS colitis, which may contain microbiota-specific memory T cells, were enriched with Foxp3 + Tregs and, therefore, not colitogenic (Kaede-Green + T cells in Figures 6 E–6K). Thus, the microbiota-specific CD4 + T cells that arise during acute gut inflammation likely retain their tolerogenic phenotype. On the other hand, oral pathobiont-reactive T cells that arise during periodontitis are colitogenic. These differences may be due to the distinct immunological properties of the oral and gastrointestinal mucosa. Although the reason why the tolerogenicity of these two mucosal sites differs remains to be explored, the distinct microbial and immunological milieus may, in part, explain this difference. For example, the gut mucosa is colonized by butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Clostridium strains, and this microbial metabolite shapes tolerogenic immunity by promoting generation of Foxp3 + Treg cells as well as inducing secretion of IL-10 by mucosal mononuclear phagocytes ( Furusawa et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014 30. Furusawa, Y. ∙ Obata, Y. ∙ Fukuda, S. ... Commensal microbe-derived butyrate induces the differentiation of colonic regulatory T cells Nature. 2013; 504 :446-450 Crossref Scopus (3745) PubMed Google Scholar 85. Singh, N. ∙ Gurav, A. ∙ Sivaprakasam, S. ... Activation of Gpr109a, receptor for niacin and the commensal metabolite butyrate, suppresses colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis Immunity. 2014; 40 :128-139 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1649) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the availability of butyrate may be limited in the oral mucosa and periodontium because of the absence of butyrate-producing bacteria as well as appropriate substrates (e.g., dietary fibers). Likewise, the gut mucosa has at its disposal alternative immune mechanisms that limit generation of microbiota-reactive effector T cells. For example, a subset of innate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-expressing lymphoid cells inhibits proliferation of microbiota-specific T cells ( Hepworth et al., 2015 38. Hepworth, M.R. ∙ Fung, T.C. ∙ Masur, S.H. ... Immune tolerance. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells mediate intestinal selection of commensal bacteria-specific CD4 + T cells Science. 2015; 348 :1031-1035 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ). The oral mucosa and gingiva likely lack these multi-layered tolerogenic mechanisms that are present in the gut. Consequently, acute inflammation in the oral mucosa can trigger generation of microbiota-reactive pathogenic T cells.
Th17 cells play a key pathogenic role in commensal bacterium-driven inflammation in the oral cavity in mice and humans ( Beklen et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2016; Dutzan et al., 2018; Eskan et al., 2012; Moutsopoulos et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2005 11.

Consistent with this concept, we found that ligature-induced periodontal inflammation causes proliferation of oral commensal pathobiont-reactive Th17 cells. However, the commensal-specific Th17 cells that naturally occur in the gut ( Atarashi et al., 2015; Ivanov et al., 2009; Shaw et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2018 8. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Ando, M. ...

It has been reported that Th17 cells undergo pathogenic conversion under certain circumstances in the gut and give rise to IFN-γ-producing Th1-like CD4 + T cells. These ex-Th17 cells are pathogenic and cause severe intestinal inflammation ( Ahern et al., 2010; Harbour et al., 2015 3. Ahern, P.P. ∙ Schiering, C. ∙ Buonocore, S. ...

USA. 2015; 112 :7061-7066 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we found that the oral commensal pathobiont-specific T EM cells that arise during periodontitis had a RORγt + T-bet − Th17 phenotype and indeed produced IL-17A but not IFN-γ ( Figures 5 A–5F; Figure S7 A). However, after arriving at the gut mucosa, these cells could produce IFN-γ ( Figure S7 F). Thus, functional conversion of oral Th17 T EM cells into the IFN-γ-producing Th17/Th1 mixed phenotype may be involved in the pathogenesis of colitis elicited by oral T cells.
Collectively, our results provide evidence that the oral and gastrointestinal mucosae are microbiologically and immunologically connected. Thus, optimal oral care (e.g., removal of pathogenic oral biofilms and reduction of periodontal inflammation) could reduce the risk of IBD by limiting the expansion of pathogenic effector T lymphocytes and their reactive antigens. Likewise, inhibition of migration of oral T EM cells to the gut might be an alternative strategy used to block the pathogenic mouth-gut axis in the context of IBD.

Eight- to twelve-week-old female and male mice were used. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 were housed in the Animal Facility at the University of Michigan. Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice were housed in flexible film isolators at the University of Michigan Gnotobiotic Animal Facility. The absence of microbes in GF mice was verified weekly by aerobic and anaerobic microbial culture and microscopic analysis of stained cecal contents. For gnotobiotic mice experiments, GF mice were reconstituted with consortia of identified bacterial strains. Gnotobiotic mice were housed in positive-pressure individually ventilated cages (IVC) (ISOcage P, Techniplast) per each condition to prevent cross-contamination among the different experimental groups ( Hecht et al., 2014; Nagao-Kitamoto et al., 2016; Paik et al., 2015 36.

GF and gnotobiotic mice were given autoclaved distilled water, provided ad libitum , and sterile animal chow (rodent breeder diet 5013 (LabDiet)). SPF mice were fed a sterilized laboratory rodent diet 5L0D (LabDiet). All animals were handled in accordance with the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Michigan and were in concordance with ARRIVE guidelines for preclinical studies ( Kilkenny et al., 2010 46.

For the isolation of oral bacteria, ligatures were collected from mice 3 h post ligature placement (healthy oral microbiota; HOM) or 14 days post ligature placement (ligature-associated microbiota; LOM) and resuspended in sterile cold-PBS. Then, the bacterial suspensions were spread onto brain heart infusion agar plates containing 5% FBS or MacConkey agar plates and incubated overnight under aerobic conditions at 37°C. Bacterial DNA was extracted from each single colony and the identity of individual isolates was verified by Sanger sequencing of the V1-V9 regions of 16S rRNA genes. The following primer set was used for amplifications: Eubacteria16S_8F; 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ and Eubacteria16S_1492R; 5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′. Whole genome sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq (500v2) platform. 150 bp-long high quality paired-end reads were assembled into contigs by SPAdes 3.13.0 ( Bankevich et al., 2012 10. Bankevich, A. ∙ Nurk, S. ∙ Antipov, D. ... SPAdes: a new genome assembly algorithm and its applications to single-cell sequencing J. Comput. Biol. 2012; 19 :455-477 Crossref Scopus (17085) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the assembled contigs were annotated by RAST ( Seemann, 2014 78. Seemann, T. Prokka: rapid prokaryotic genome annotation Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2068-2069 Crossref Scopus (10433) PubMed Google Scholar ). Isolates were identified by BLAST using the rpoB gene sequences. Gut commensal Bacteroides strains ( B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, and B. vulgatus ) were obtained from Dr. Thaddeus Stappenbeck ( Bloom et al., 2011 12. Bloom, S.M. ∙ Bijanki, V.N. ∙ Nava, G.M. ...

For the cell isolation from lymph nodes, the dissected lymph nodes were pressed through a 100 μm nylon filter using the black rubber end of a 1-mL syringe plunger, and then digested by complete RPMI containing 400 U/mL type 3 collagenase and 0.01 mg/mL DNase I (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) for 30 min at 37°C. Then, if needed, the EasySep Mouse CD4 + T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) was used to purify the CD4 + T cells. For the lamina propria (LP) cell isolation from colon, the dissected mucosal tissue was incubated in calcium and magnesium-free Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 1.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies) and 1 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove mucus. Epithelial cells were removed by incubation in HBSS containing 1 mM EDTA (Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD) at 37°C for 30 min. After washing with HBSS, remaining tissues were collected and incubated, with agitation, in HBSS containing 400 U/mL type 3 collagenase and 0.01 mg/mL DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) for 90 min at 37°C. The digested cell fraction was pelleted, re-suspended in a 40% Percoll solution (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA), layered on top of a 75% Percoll solution, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min at room temperature. Viable lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) were recovered from the discontinuous gradient interface.
For myeloid cell analysis by conventional flow cytometry, isolated immune cells were labeled with DAPI and stained with anti-CD45, IL-1β, Ly6C, MHCII, CD11c, and CD64 antibodies. For the surface staining in the lymphoid cell analysis, anti-CD3e, CD4, CD44, CD62L, CD25, α4 β7, and CCR9 antibodies were used, accordingly. For intranuclear staining, cells were permeabilized and stained with T-bet, RORγt, and Foxp3 using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Kit (Tonbo Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All data were collected on a BD LSRFortessa and BD Celesta FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).
We validated a 40-marker panel for CyTOF murine immune profiling. The lanthanide metals were acquired from Fluidigm and conjugated to antibodies using a maxpar antibody labeling kit. The final concentration of the metal-tagged antibody was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The immune cells were stained with 1.25 μM live/dead stain (Cell-ID Cisplatin-195Pt diluted in serum-free media from 500 mM stock). Free cisplatin was quenched by washing the cells with serum-containing media. The metal-tagged antibody cocktail was made in CyFACS buffer and added to the cells in the presence of TruStain FcX (Biolegends) and incubated on ice for 60 min. Then, cells were fixed with 1.6% PFA and permeabilized with eBioscience permeabilization buffer for 30 min. The cells were then stained with 50 μL of intracellular staining metal-tagged antibody cocktail (made in eBioscience permeabilization buffer) at RT for 60 min. Intracellularly stained cells were then permeabilized and stained with Cell-ID Intercalator overnight at 4°C, washed, filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer, and acquired using the CyTOF Helios system (Fluidigm). Total events were gated to remove noncellular events, dead cells, and doublets. CD45 + live singlets were then subjected to viSNE analysis with 10,000 cells per sample using the Cytobank platform. ViSNE produces a two-dimensional map that preserves the relationships present in the structure of high-dimensional data ( Amir et al., 2013 4.

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and silk sutures (100 μm diameter; SUT-15-1; Roboz Surgical Instrument Co.) were inserted between the first and second maxillary molars on contralateral right and left sides. Both ends of the suture string were knotted to prevent ligature loss. The silk sutures remained in place for 14 days or 3 h (sham control). Mice were euthanized at the end points of each experiment. Inserted sutures were collected from the euthanized mice and used for microbial analyses. Block biopsies from the maxillae were fixed in 10% formalin. The fixed tissues were then used to check bone loss by micro–computed tomography (micro-CT) ( Jiao et al., 2013 43. Jiao, Y. ∙ Darzi, Y. ∙ Tawaratsumida, K. ...

For DSS-induced colitis, SPF C57BL/6 WT mice with ligatures (day 14) were treated with 1.5% DSS for 5 days. The animals were monitored for weight loss (0, none; 1, 1%–5%; 2, 5%–10%; 3, 10%–20%; 4, > 20%), stool consistency (0, normal stool; 2, loose stool; 4, diarrhea), and hemoccult (0, normal; 2, hemoccult positive; 4, gross blood) during the course of experiments, and these parameters were used to compute the disease activity index. Mice were sacrificed on day 7 and histological scores were assigned in a blind manner by a trained pathologist evaluating the following set of variables ( Cooper et al., 1993; Klopfleisch, 2013 20. Cooper, H.S. ∙ Murthy, S.N. ∙ Shah, R.S. ... Clinicopathologic study of dextran sulfate sodium experimental murine colitis Lab. Invest. 1993; 69 :238-249 PubMed Google Scholar 48. Klopfleisch, R. Multiparametric and semiquantitative scoring systems for the evaluation of mouse model histopathology--a systematic review BMC Vet. Res. 2013; 9 :123 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ): severity of inflammation (0, none; 1, low density confined to mucosa; 2, moderate or higher density in mucosa and/or low to moderate density in mucosa and submucosa; 3, high density in submucosa and/or extension to muscularis; 4, high density with frequent transmural extension), and extent of epithelial/crypt damage (0, none; 1, basal 1/3; 2, basal 2/3; 3, crypt loss; 4, crypt and surface epithelial destruction). Each variable was multiplied by a factor reflecting the percentage of the colon involved (1, 0%–25%; 2, 26%–50%; 3, 51%–75%; 4, 76%–100%). An overall score was obtained by summing the scores assigned to each variable. For oral pathobiont colonization experiments, mice received 2.0% DSS for 5 days followed by regular water for 2 days. The oral pathobiont SK431 ( K. aerogenes ) was used for oral challenge every day (1 × 10 9 CFU/dose). The IL-1R antagonist anakinra (50 mg/kg) or saline was i.p. injected into Ka-colonized mice every day. Histological analysis was performed as described above.
GF Il10 −/− mice were colonized with either HOM or LOM, and maintained for 56 days. For the experiments with synthetic oral communities, a mixture of 3 isolates from HOM ( Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sp. JS71, and Staphylococcus xylosus ) or 5 isolates from LOM ( Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella variicola, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter hormachaei ) was used (10 9 CFU of each strain per mouse). All mice inoculated with bacterial mixtures were housed in gnotobiotic isolators. Mice were sacrificed on day 56 and histological assessment was performed in a blind fashion by a trained pathologist using a previously described immune cell–driven colitis scoring system ( Erben et al., 2014 25. Erben, U. ∙ Loddenkemper, C. ∙ Doerfel, K. ... A guide to histomorphological evaluation of intestinal inflammation in mouse models Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 2014; 7 :4557-4576 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, severity of inflammation was evaluated according to the following scale: (0, none; 1, minimal (lesions restricted to mucosa; lesions consist of minimal hyperplasia with minimal scattered inflammation); 2, mild (lesions affecting mucosa with infrequent submucosal extension; lesions consist of mild hyperplasia with mild inflammation ± minimal goblet cell loss, and/or erosions); 3, moderate (lesions affecting mucosa and submucosa; lesions consist of moderate hyperplasia with moderate inflammation ± few crypt abscesses, moderate goblet cell loss, and/or erosions); 4, severe (lesions affecting mucosa and submucosa; lesions consist of severe hyperplasia with multifocal severe inflammation ± several crypt abscesses, erosions/ulcerations, and/or irregular crypts/crypt loss); 5, marked (transmural lesions, lesions consist of marked hyperplasia with marked inflammation, +/− multiple crypt abscesses, erosions/ulcerations, irregular crypts/crypt loss, and/or inflammation).
For the isolation of CD4 + T cells from cLN, cLNs were harvested from ligature mice (day 14) and the mouse CD4 + T cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) was used to isolate cells from single cell suspensions prepared from the cLNs. For the preparation of the bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDMs), murine bone marrow cells were cultured in the RPMI/10% FBS containing recombinant murine 10 ng/mL GM-CSF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 6 days. Loosely attached DC cells were then collected using the biotin selection kit (STEMCELL Technologies) and enriched with biotinylated CD11c monoclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). BMDCs were pulsed with heat-denatured bacterial antigens for 18 h at 37°C. Antigen-pulsed BMDCs and cLN-derived CD4 + T cells were co-cultured for 24 h at 37°C. Cytokines in supernatants were quantified by ELISA.
Kaede Tg mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. Lubricating ophthalmic ointment was placed in each eye to prevent dryness. The overlying fur around the cLN area was removed using a depilatory cream or an electric shaver. Following hair removal, the operating field was properly sterilized, as required by the rodent surgery guidelines and covered with a surgical drape. A skin incision was made in the depilated area (5–10 mm). The mice were placed on their backs with an aluminum foil blanket covering all but the depilated area, and violet light (LRD-0405 Collimated Diode Laser System; Laserglow Technologies, North York, ON, Canada) was shone (405 nm; peak power < 50 mW) onto the exposed area for a period of 1 min (50 mW direct exposure). In order for both LNs to be simultaneously exposed to violet light, we attached a lens to the laser, thus blurring the beam, and the laser head was positioned 5–20 cm above the mouse. Following photoconversion, the incision was closed with simple interrupted sutures (4.0 Vicryl, 1.5 metric; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ).
GF Rag1 −/− mice were colonized by either sHOM or sLOM for 14 days. CD3 + CD4 + CD44 hi CD62L lo CD25 - T EM cells were isolated from the cLNs of ligature mice (day 14). Isolated T EM cells (2 × 10 5 cells/mouse) were then adoptively transferred into gnotobiotic (sHOM or sLOM) Rag1 −/− mice and control GF Rag1 −/− mice. Rag1 −/− mice were maintained for 8 weeks post adoptive transfer. For experiments with Kaede mice, LPMCs were isolated from ligature and DSS-treated Kaede mice. Kaede-Red + or Kaede-Green + CD3 + CD4 + T cells were then sorted by FACS and adoptively transferred into SPF Rag1 −/− mice (2 × 10 5 cells/mouse, i.v.), respectively. The negative control group received saline. The mice were monitored for 8 weeks post adoptive transfer. After 8 weeks, K. aerogenes SK431 (1 × 10 9 CFU/mouse) was administered orally 3 times per week for an additional 4 weeks. Histological assessment was performed in a blind fashion by a trained pathologist using the immune cell-driven colitis scoring system described above.
SPF CD45.2 + mice were treated with oral ligatures for 14 days and then surgically attached to congenic CD45.1 + mice. Briefly, 2 age-matched females (CD45.1 + and CD45.2 + , respectively) were placed in the supine position. The hair on the left side of the mouse was placed on the left, and the hair on the right side of the mouse was placed on the right was thoroughly shaved starting about 1 cm above the elbow to 1 cm below the knee. Carprofen was given to the mice for analgesia. Using sterile, sharp scissors, longitudinal skin incisions were made on the shaved side of each animal, from 0.5 cm above the elbow to 0.5 cm below the knee joint. After making the incision, the skin from the subcutaneous fascia was gently detached by holding the skin up with a pair of curved forceps and separating the fascia with a second pair to create 0.5 cm of free skin. Surgical autoclips (9-mm, BD Biosciences) were used to join the skin of the two mice. Each pair of mice joined by parabiosis was housed in a cage (i.e., 2 mice (joined by parabiosis) per cage). During the 1-week recovery phase, the analgesic carprofen was given every 24 h for 2 days. One week after surgery, K. aerogenes (10 9 CFU/shot) and DSS (100 mg/shot), which allow oral pathobionts to colonize the gut by disrupting gut colonization resistance, were administered by oral gavage to recipient CD45.1 + mice only, daily for 6 days.
Isolation of murine colonoid cultures was performed as previously described ( Reed et al., 2019; Sato et al., 2009 70. Reed, M. ∙ Luissint, A.C. ∙ Azcutia, V. ... Epithelial CD47 is critical for mucosal repair in the murine intestine in vivo Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5004 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar 74. Sato, T. ∙ Vries, R.G. ∙ Snippert, H.J. ... Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche Nature. 2009; 459 :262-265 Crossref Scopus (5050) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, freshly isolated colons were treated with Cell Recovery Solution (Corning) for 5min followed by additional 30 min in ice-cold chelation buffer (50 mM EDTA/PBS) for 30 min with gentle inversion at 4°C. Colons were then shaken to dissociate crypt fraction. After centrifugation (400 g, 10min at 4°C), colonic crypts in the pellet were resuspended in complete enteroid medium (advanced DMEM/F12 based medium containing 50% LWRN condition media and 200 ng/ml of recombinant human EGF) and seeded on to collagen type IV-coated 48-well tissue culture plates until confluency was achieved (∼24 h).
To generate bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), BM cells were isolated from SPF WT C57BL/6 mice and cultured for 6 days with Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium supplemented with 30% L929 supernatant. Colonic lamina propria (LP) cells were isolated from DSS-induced colitis mice. BMDMs or colonic LP cells were co-cultured with oral or gut bacterial strains (MOI = 5) for 3 h. Gentamicin (100 μg/ml) was then added and cells were further cultured for additional 16 h. For bacteria-epithelial cells (T84, mouse 2D colonoids) co-culture experiments, bacterial strains at MOI = 10 were used. Gentamicin (100 μg/ml) was added 3 h after co-culture, and cells were then incubated for additional 16 h. Culture supernatants were harvested, and cytokines were measured by ELISA. In some experiments, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 was used as a positive control ( Franchi et al., 2012 29. Franchi, L. ∙ Kamada, N. ∙ Nakamura, Y. ... NLRC4-driven production of IL-1β discriminates between pathogenic and commensal bacteria and promotes host intestinal defense Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :449-456 Crossref Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For gut microbiome analysis, fecal samples were obtained from individual mice. For oral microbiome analysis, inserted silk sutures were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted by using a modified protocol of the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) ( Nagao-Kitamoto et al., 2016 61. Nagao-Kitamoto, H. ∙ Shreiner, A.B. ∙ Gillilland, 3rd, M.G. ... Functional characterization of inflammatory bowel disease-associated gut dysbiosis in gnotobiotic mice Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 2 :468-481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microbiome analysis was performed at the Microbial Systems Molecular Biology Laboratory at the University of Michigan. 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed using primers specific to the V4 region and processed using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Sequences were curated using the community-supported software program Mothur version 1.39.0 ( Schloss et al., 2009 76. Schloss, P.D. ∙ Westcott, S.L. ∙ Ryabin, T. ... Introducing mothur: open-source, platform-independent, community-supported software for describing and comparing microbial communities Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75 :7537-7541 Crossref Scopus (16390) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequences were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a cutoff = 0.03 and classified against the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) 16S rRNA gene training set (version 16) using a naive Bayesian approach with an 80% confidence threshold. Curated OTU sequence data were converted to relative abundance ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) ( Segata et al., 2011 79. Segata, N. ∙ Izard, J. ∙ Waldron, L. ... Metagenomic biomarker discovery and explanation Genome Biol. 2011; 12 :R60 Crossref Scopus (10310) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to identify bacterial taxa that were differentially abundant, biologically consistent, and had the greatest effect size.
Unless otherwise stated in individual method sections above, all statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Differences between two groups were evaluated using the Student t test (parametric) or Mann–Whitney U test (non-parametric). For a comparison of more than 3 groups, statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (parametric) or Kruskal–Wallis test (non-parametric), followed by the Bonferroni correction for parametric samples, or Dunn’s test for non-parametric samples as a post hoc test. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier curves, with comparisons between groups made using the log-rank test. Differences of p < 0.05 were considered significant in all statistical analyses. Statistically significant differences are shown with asterisks as follows: ∗ ; p < 0.05, ∗∗ ; p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ ; p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗ ; p < 0.0001; whereas, ns indicates comparisons that are not significant. Numbers of animals (n) used for individual experiments, details of the statistical tests used and pooled values for several biological replicates are indicated in the respective figure legends.
