Title: A Structural Model of the Endogenous Human BAF Complex Informs Disease Mechanisms


Abstract: Summary

Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that regulate genomic architecture. Here, we present a structural model of the endogenously purified human canonical BAF complex bound to the nucleosome, generated using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), cross-linking mass spectrometry, and homology modeling. BAF complexes bilaterally engage the nucleosome H2A/H2B acidic patch regions through the SMARCB1 C-terminal α-helix and the SMARCA4/2 C-terminal SnAc/post-SnAc regions, with disease-associated mutations in either causing attenuated chromatin remodeling activities. Further, we define changes in BAF complex architecture upon nucleosome engagement and compare the structural model of endogenous BAF to those of related SWI/SNF-family complexes. Finally, we assign and experimentally interrogate cancer-associated hot-spot mutations localizing within the endogenous human BAF complex, identifying those that disrupt BAF subunit-subunit and subunit-nucleosome interfaces in the nucleosome-bound conformation. Taken together, this integrative structural approach provides important biophysical foundations for understanding the mechanisms of BAF complex function in normal and disease states.

Section: Introduction

ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are multi-component entities that govern nuclear architecture by altering nucleosome positioning and content. Originally discovered and characterized in yeast, chromatin remodelers fall into the SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD, and INO80 families, each of which contains helicase subunits (ATPases) and several additional components that diversify their activities and chromatin-targeting proclivities ( Clapier et al., 2017 8. Clapier, C.R. ∙ Iwasa, J. ∙ Cairns, B.R. ... Mechanisms of action and regulation of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complexes Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :407-422 Crossref Scopus (739) PubMed Google Scholar ). Members of the SWI/SNF family, including SWI/SNF and RSC in yeast, slide and evict nucleosomes and differ from members of other families with respect to their diverse subtypes, heterogeneous subunit compositions, activities on mammalian chromatin, and uniquely strong links to human disease ( Kadoch et al., 2013 20. Kadoch, C. ∙ Hargreaves, D.C. ∙ Hodges, C. ... Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes identifies extensive roles in human malignancy Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 :592-601 Crossref Scopus (1003) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) complexes exist in three distinct configurations: canonical BAF (BAF or cBAF) complexes, polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complexes, and non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complexes, each distinguished by the incorporation of distinct accessory subunits as well as their targeting patterns on the genome ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27.

Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :1410-1420 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, the genes encoding subunits of mSWI/SNF-family complexes are mutated in over 20% of human cancers and in several neurodevelopmental and intellectual disability syndromes in which mutations are causative, making them the most frequently mutated chromatin regulators in human disease ( Bögershausen and Wollnik, 2018 5.

The most abundant and highly mutated complex within the mSWI/SNF family is the canonical BAF complex, which contains as defining components the ARID1A/B subunit paralogs and the DPF2 reader subunit ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). BAF complexes localize predominantly to distal enhancer sites genome-wide, regulating their accessibility and activating tissue-specific gene expression ( Nakayama et al., 2017 33. Nakayama, R.T. ∙ Pulice, J.L. ∙ Valencia, A.M. ... SMARCB1 is required for widespread BAF complex-mediated activation of enhancers and bivalent promoters Nat.

The ATPase module of mammalian SWI/SNF family complexes mediates subcomplex identity and catalytic activity-independent genomic targeting Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :618-626 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). They are thus major tumor suppressor entities that play critical roles in mediating proper cell differentiation down terminal tissue lineages ( Eroglu et al., 2014 9.

USA. 2009; 106 :5181-5186 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, perturbations to cBAF complexes in particular disrupt normal enhancer accessibility and hence transcription-factor access to their cognate recognition motifs, thereby causing program-level disruption of tissue differentiation ( Kelso et al., 2017 22.

While over the past several years the field has gained an increasing understanding regarding the role of human SWI/SNF complexes in normal cell states, during development, and in disease, studies defining their subunit organization, assembly ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 3D structure have only recently begun to emerge. Particularly, high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have become available for the related yet distinct yeast RSC ( Patel et al., 2019 37. Patel, A.B. ∙ Moore, C.M. ∙ Greber, B.J. ...

Structure of the RSC complex bound to the nucleosome Science. 2019; 366 :838-843 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and yeast SWI/SNF complexes ( Han et al., 2020 13. Han, Y. ∙ Reyes, A.A. ∙ Malik, S. ... Cryo-EM structure of SWI/SNF complex bound to a nucleosome Nature. 2020; 579 :452-455 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ), and, during revision of this study, for a recombinant human BAF complex ( He et al., 2020 15. He, S. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Tian, Y. ... Structure of nucleosome-bound human BAF complex Science. 2020; 367 :875-881 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ), each bound to the nucleosome, confirming the previously established modular subunit organization for the SWI/SNF family of remodelers ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ) and shedding new light on complex-nucleosome engagement mechanisms. Interestingly, although considered highly conserved, only a fraction of the total recurrent single-residue human disease-associated mutations can be mapped onto the structures of the yRSC, ySWI/SNF, and recombinant BAF complexes, leaving several mutations awaiting structural and functional assignment.
Here, we present a three-dimensional (3D) structural model of the endogenously purified human canonical BAF complex bound to the nucleosome using a combination of single-particle cryo-EM, cross-linking mass-spectrometry (CX-MS), and homology modeling. We report two single-particle cryo-EM maps for the human BAF complex, in isolation and in complex with a nucleosome core particle (NCP), highlighting recently identified mammalian-specific subunits and domains and their binding interactions. We perform extensive comparative analyses with related SWI/SNF-family complexes and chromatin remodelers of other classes. Importantly, we leverage the structure of the fully assembled endogenous human BAF complex to inform its mechanism of action and motion on nucleosome substrates, structural requirements for remodeling activities, and functional deficits caused by previously uncharacterized, recurrent cancer-specific missense mutations. Taken together, these studies provide the foundation for comprehensive dissection of human BAF complex-nucleosome interactions and the impact of recurrent disease-associated mutations in this major chromatin regulatory entity, opening up new directions for the field at large.

Section: Results

In this study, we purified endogenous human BAF complexes for structural examination by both cryo-EM and CX-MS ( Figure S1 A) using expression of an HA-tagged DPF2 subunit to uniquely capture canonical BAF complexes in HEK293F cells. Purified HA-DPF2-containing complexes were then subjected to density sedimentation to isolate fully formed BAF complexes ( Figure S1 B) using approaches previously established by our group ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Complexes were confirmed to be catalytically active and to exhibit nucleosome-remodeling activity, as assessed by ATPase activity assays (by ADP-Glo measurements) and restriction enzyme accessibility assays (REAA), respectively ( Figures S1 C and S1D).
For cryo-EM analyses, purified BAF complexes were stabilized using GraFix ( Kastner et al., 2008 21. Kastner, B. ∙ Fischer, N. ∙ Golas, M.M. ... GraFix: sample preparation for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :53-55 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stark, 2010 49. Stark, H. GraFix: stabilization of fragile macromolecular complexes for single particle cryo-EM Methods Enzymol. 2010; 481 :109-126 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ), vitrified, and imaged by cryo-EM ( Figure S1 E). A total of ∼600,000 particles were subjected to 2D and 3D classification, which revealed a complex consisting of two major lobes, an elongated upper lobe in close contact with a triangular lower lobe ( Figures S1 F and S1G). Further 3D classification and refinement steps focusing on the lower lobe yielded a density map for this region of the BAF complex at a 7.8 Å resolution ( Figures S1 G and S1H). Attempts to obtain a map for the upper lobe at sub-nanometer resolution were unsuccessful. Reasoning that NCP binding may stabilize BAF complexes, we next incubated BAF complexes with NCPs and stabilized them using the GraFix approach ( Kastner et al., 2008 21. Kastner, B. ∙ Fischer, N. ∙ Golas, M.M. ... GraFix: sample preparation for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :53-55 Crossref Scopus (392) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stark, 2010 49. Stark, H. GraFix: stabilization of fragile macromolecular complexes for single particle cryo-EM Methods Enzymol. 2010; 481 :109-126 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S2 A–S2C). For CX-MS analysis, the BAF-NCP complex was fixed with bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3) instead of glutaraldehyde and confirmed to migrate in the expected fractions on sucrose gradients prior to mass-spectrometric analysis ( Figure S2 D).
Following vitrification and imaging ( Figure S2 E), a total of ∼1,700,000 particles were automatically picked and subjected to image processing ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Refinement of ∼880,000 NCP-bound BAF particles yielded a map that showed clear density for the nucleosome and the BAF domains in direct contact with it. Following focused classification and refinement, density maps were produced for these regions at ∼5.8 Å resolution ( Figures S2 F and S2G; Table S1 ), yielding a composite density map of the endogenous human BAF complex bound to a nucleosome ( Figure S3 A). Because the resolution of the map was insufficient to deduce the subunit organization, we assembled high-convergence homology models of subunit domains ( Song et al., 2013 47. Song, Y. ∙ DiMaio, F. ∙ Wang, R.Y. ... High-resolution comparative modeling with RosettaCM Structure. 2013; 21 :1735-1742 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (813) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S3 B–S3E) into the density map, guided by CX-MS data of human BAF-NCP complex ( Figure S3 F; Table S2 ) and the high-resolution structure of the yeast SWI/SNF complex ( Han et al., 2020 13. Han, Y. ∙ Reyes, A.A. ∙ Malik, S. ... Cryo-EM structure of SWI/SNF complex bound to a nucleosome Nature. 2020; 579 :452-455 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). This integrative strategy resulted in a model of the endogenous human BAF complex bound to the nucleosome ( Figures 1 A and 1B).
Our model of the BAF-NCP complex reveals that the human cBAF complex is composed of three main structural modules, consistent with previous biochemical findings obtained with free BAF complexes ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ), arranged in a “C shape” around the NCP. We term these the BAF “core module”, which forms the triangular lower lobe abutting the nucleosome via the SMARCB1 C-terminal domain (CTD), the catalytic “ATPase module” comprised of the SMARCA4/2 ATPase subunit C-terminal region that interacts with the face of the nucleosome opposite that contacted by the core module, and the “ARP module”, which connects these two modules via the SMARCA4 HSA domain ( Figures 1 A and 1B; Video S1 ). The BAF complex engages both faces of the NCP, interacting with both core histone folds over the H2A/H2B acidic patches. The endogenous human complex (1.44 MDa) is 245 Å in height and 162 Å in width, which makes it ∼4.5 times larger than the NCP (98 Å in diameter). Several regions of the map not accounted for by the model, and not present in maps of recombinant or yeast complexes, could be putatively assigned to BAF subunits based on CX-MS data ( Figures 1 A, 1B, S4 A–S4C, and further described in Figure 2 ).

Structural Model of the Endogenous BAF Complex, Spin View, Related to Figures 1, S1, S2, and S3
The ATPase module consists of the catalytic helicase domains of SMARCA4, which interact with the “top” nucleosome face as well as with the nucleosomal DNA at the superhelical location 2 (SHL 2) position ( Figure 1 C; Video S2 ; Liu et al., 2017 25. Liu, X. ∙ Li, M. ∙ Xia, X. ... Mechanism of chromatin remodelling revealed by the Snf2-nucleosome structure Nature. 2017; 544 :440-445 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ARP module, consisting of subunits ACTB and ACTL6A, interacts with the long α-helix formed by the SMARCA4 HSA domain (aa 447–531), which connects the ATPase and core modules ( Figures 1 A and 1D). The long HSA α-helix passes laterally by the NCP to interact with ARM repeats 5–7 of ARID1 (termed core-binding region [CBR]) and continues into the core to form the anchor domain of SMARCA4, which includes two α-helical segments that interact with the SANT domains of the two SMARCC subunits, SMARCC1 and SMARCC2 ( Figure 1 E). This organization is further supported by CX-MS data indicating that the SMARCA4 ATPase is the most extensively cross-linked subunit within the complex and contains a number of regions within the ATPase itself and the other ATPase-bound subunits that mediate interactions to NCP core and tail regions ( Figure 1 F).

Interfaces of the BAF Complex with the NCP, Including Interfaces of the ATPase Module with the NCP (Part 1) and the SMARCB1 Subunit with the NCP (Part 2), Related to Figure 1
The base of the BAF core module is formed by a helical bundle that includes the coiled-coil (CC) domains of the two SMARCC1/2 subunits (previously termed CAR and dimerization regions, respectively) ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ) and those of the SMARCD and SMARCE1 subunits ( Figure 1 G). The assembly of the SMARCC1/2 and SMARCD subunits into an interconnected helical bundle provides a structural explanation for the previous finding that deletion of any of these subunits completely abrogates BAF complex formation ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mammalian-specific SMARCE1 subunit is positioned more peripherally to the helical bundle, explaining why deletion of this subunit does not completely inhibit complex formation ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the helical bundle forms one side of the “V-shaped” core module, the other side is formed by the SANT and SWIRM domains of the two SMARCC1 subunits, ending in the SMARCB1 subunit, which interacts with the NCP at the H2A/H2B acidic patch region ( Figure 1 H; Video S2 ), as recently shown by our group ( Valencia et al., 2019 54. Valencia, A.M. ∙ Collings, C.K. ∙ Dao, H.T. ... Recurrent SMARCB1 Mutations Reveal a Nucleosome Acidic Patch Interaction Site That Potentiates mSWI/SNF Complex Chromatin Remodeling Cell. 2019; 179 :1342-1356 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then seen in the structures of the yeast and human recombinant SWI/SNF complexes ( Han et al., 2020 13. Han, Y. ∙ Reyes, A.A. ∙ Malik, S. ... Cryo-EM structure of SWI/SNF complex bound to a nucleosome Nature. 2020; 579 :452-455 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ; He et al., 2020 15. He, S. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Tian, Y. ... Structure of nucleosome-bound human BAF complex Science. 2020; 367 :875-881 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). The V shape of the core is bridged by the C-terminal armadillo (ARM) repeats (or CBR) of the ARID1 subunit, which on one side forms an extensive interface with the CC and SWIB domains of SMARCD of the helical bundle, and on the other side interacts with one of the SMARCC1 SWIRM domains. This subunit arrangement scaffolds the core module as a single rigid entity within the full BAF complex.
In addition to the structural model, CX-MS data obtained with endogenous BAF-NCP complexes allowed us to localize mammalian-specific subunits within the cryo-EM map ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and 2 A; Video S3 ). These include the recently identified subunits of the BCL7A/B/C family (∼23 kDa) and SS18 (46 kDa), each comprised of mostly unstructured, intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) regions and strongly implicated in cancer ( Kadoch and Crabtree, 2013 18. Kadoch, C. ∙ Crabtree, G.R. Reversible disruption of mSWI/SNF (BAF) complexes by the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion in synovial sarcoma Cell. 2013; 153 :71-85 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kadoch et al., 2013 20. Kadoch, C. ∙ Hargreaves, D.C. ∙ Hodges, C. ... Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes identifies extensive roles in human malignancy Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 :592-601 Crossref Scopus (1003) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified cross-links of these components at their N termini with BAF subunits and/or with the NCP ( Figures 2 A and S3 F). In the NCP-bound conformation, the BCL7A N terminus (aa 1–40), within which recurrent mutations are found in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) ( Baliñas-Gavira et al., 2020 4. Baliñas-Gavira, C. ∙ Rodríguez, M.I. ∙ Andrades, A. ... Frequent mutations in the amino-terminal domain of BCL7A impair its tumor suppressor role in DLBCL Leukemia. 2020; 34 :2722-2735 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), interacts with the HSA domain of SMARCA4 near its contact with ARP-module subunits ACTL6A and ACTB, and with the nucleosome acidic patch (H2B) and SMARCB1 CTD ( Figure 2 B). Specifically, we detected cross-links at amino acids 15, 19 of BCL7A with amino acids 496, 499 of SMARCA4 ( Figure 2 B). Further, we observed a shift in the positioning of the HSA domain and hence ARP module relative to the NCP in models of endogenous versus recombinant BAF-NCP complexes, suggesting a potential function for BCL7A as a “bridge” or “spacer” that evolved in metazoans for a yet-to-be-established function, for example, to accommodate the binding of specific factors ( Figures 2 C and S4 D). SS18 contacts the disordered N-terminal region of the SMARCA4 ATPase (Lys13 of SS18 to Lys94 of SMARCA4) via its N terminus located at the base of the core module ( Figure 2 D). This provides important structural context for BAF complex core module disruption observed in synovial sarcoma, in which the SSX tail of the SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein binds the nucleosome acidic patch with higher affinity than the SMARCB1 C-terminal α-helix, providing a possible explanation for the destabilization and degradation of SMARCB1 (BAF47) ( McBride et al., 2020 30.

Structural Model of the Endogenous BAF Complex with Endogenous-Specific, Unfilled Densities Highlighted, Related to Figures 2 and 3
We also identified cross-links showing that the N termini of SMARCC1 and SMARCC2 that are not part of the model interact with SMARCB1 near the NCP attachment point ( Figure 2 E), thus mapping them to the unfilled density shown in blue in Figure 2 A. The N termini of SMARCD1/2, also not included in the model, map to the opposite side of the core module; however, additional unassigned density in this region could not be interpreted ( Figures 2 A and 2E). Finally, the large, peripheral unassigned density within the core module extending from the C-terminal core-binding region of ARID1A ( Figure 2 A) can be explained by the large N-terminal region of ARID1A (∼170 kDa) ( Figure 2 E). Taken together, the assignment of additional subunits and subunit domains to densities in the cryo-EM map of the endogenous human BAF complex provides important context for defining their role in BAF complex function and in the evaluation of recurrent missense mutations in these subunit regions.
Our model of the endogenous BAF complex includes 36% of all the residues of the complex, whereas those of the recombinant BAF, ySWI/SNF, and yRSC complexes include 31%, 31%, and 29%, respectively ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S4 E). Integrating CX-MS data, the location of 43% of the residues in the mSWI/SNF complex could be assigned ( Figure S4 F).
Comparison of the cryo-EM density for the ATPase modules across the models of the endogenous BAF complex (this study) and other SWI/SNF family complexes ( Han et al., 2020 13.

Structure of the RSC complex bound to the nucleosome Science. 2019; 366 :838-843 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed several notable features. (1) The map of the endogenous human BAF complex shows additional density near the “top” nucleosome acidic patch region ( Figure 3 C, top, middle), which CX-MS and modeling experiments identified as the SnAc and post-SnAc domains of SMARCA4 (aa 1,307–1,418) ( Figure 3 C, bottom). (2) The ATPase components closely interact with the nucleosomal DNA only in the yeast SWI/SNF and RSC complexes, whereas those of the human complexes form more loose, if any, interactions with DNA, suggesting that the structural models may have captured the complex in different functional states ( Figures S5 B and S5C). (3) The endogenous human complex exhibits the largest gap between the ATPase/ARP modules and the nucleosome ( Figure 3 C, top), perhaps due to the presence of additional endogenous human-specific components tethered to the ATPase module such as BCL7A. (4) In the endogenous human BAF complex, the winged-helix (WH) DNA-binding domain localizes near the DNA-exit site of the nucleosome, supported by multiple cross-links of the WH domain to the C-terminal region of the SMARCA4 HSA domain, BCL7A, and histones ( Figure 3 D). This differs from the placement of the WH domain in the recombinant human BAF complex, where it is localized within the core module near the HSA-ARID interface. (5) There is a 16° difference in the angle between the SMARCA4 HSA domains between endogenous versus recombinant complexes, shifting the position of the pre-HSA anchor region within the core module. This may again be due to the presence of additional ATPase module components that are present only in the endogenously purified complexes ( Figures 3 E and S5 D). (6) The ATPase and core modules lie in the same plane in the human complexes but are arranged at an angle in the yeast complexes ( Figures 3 F and S5 A). (7) In the yRSC structures (PDB: 6KW4 and 6TDA ), the ATPase HSA domain is shorter in length by 16 aa ( Figure 3 F), preventing it from extending into the core module (possibly owing to increased mobility), such that the HSA-ARID interaction is not observed in the yRSC structures. Further, the extra density in the lower lobe (or core module) of yRSC, which is comprised of yRSC-specific subunits, appears to shift the position of its core module subunits laterally as compared to their position in the human cBAF (or the ySWI/SNF) structures ( Figures S5 B and S5C).
These comparisons clarify the architectural features of the endogenous cBAF complex with respect to their yeast and recombinant counterparts and also highlight the key difference between this family of remodelers and other chromatin remodelers, such as INO80 ( Ayala et al., 2018 2. Ayala, R. ∙ Willhoft, O. ∙ Aramayo, R.J. ...

Structural basis for ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling by the INO80 complex Nature. 2018; 556 :386-390 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ), Chd1 ( Farnung et al., 2017 11. Farnung, L. ∙ Vos, S.M. ∙ Wigge, C. ... Nucleosome-Chd1 structure and implications for chromatin remodelling Nature. 2017; 550 :539-542 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ), and SWR1 ( Willhoft et al., 2018 59. Willhoft, O. ∙ Ghoneim, M. ∙ Lin, C.L. ... Structure and dynamics of the yeast SWR1-nucleosome complex Science. 2018; 362 :eaat7716 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S5 E), in that only SWI/SNF-family (SWI/SNF and RSC-type) complexes form bilateral acidic-patch interactions and thus form a complete “C clamp” around the nucleosome. This bilateral nucleosome engagement, together with a uniquely high degree of NCP:histone engagement relative to NCP:DNA engagement, the orientation of the ATPase relative to the nucleosome acidic patch sites, and the addition of human-specific subunits that lack yeast homologs suggests important SWI/SNF-specific differences. We identified major differences in the distribution of human disease-associated mutations, particularly when comparing the ratio of mutations that occur at interfaces between the complex and the NCP DNA to those occurring at interfaces between the complex and the NCP histones ( Figures S5 F–S5I). Specifically, although this ratio is ∼20:1 for Chd1, INO80, and SWR1 complexes, it is more balanced for the endogenous BAF complex (ratio of 1.6:1), reflecting its increased engagement of histones ( Figure S5 I). As noted before, human cBAF complexes also exhibit higher total frequencies of mutations (20% of human cancers) compared to other chromatin-remodeling complexes ( Bailey et al., 2018 3. Bailey, M.H. ∙ Tokheim, C. ∙ Porta-Pardo, E. ..., MC3 Working Group, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations Cell. 2018; 173 :371-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1273) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kadoch et al., 2013 20. Kadoch, C. ∙ Hargreaves, D.C. ∙ Hodges, C. ... Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes identifies extensive roles in human malignancy Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 :592-601 Crossref Scopus (1003) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, the DPF2 reader subunit, which contains a Requiem (Req) domain and a tandem plant homeobox (PHD) domain, is known to only be able to associate with the fully assembled core module, the reason why we chose to tag DPF2 to purify fully assembled cBAF ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). The models of both the endogenous and recombinant BAF complexes include parts of the DPF2 subunit. We find that the N-terminal Req domain of DPF2 (aa 14–50) interfaces with the SMARCB1, SMARCC1, and ARID1A/B subunits ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Given that in the absence of SMARCB1, DPF2 is no longer detectable in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 3 G) and the spatial proximity of the DPF2 N-terminal region to SMARCB1, we used a series of truncation variants to map the region of SMARCB1 responsible for DPF2 recruitment. We observed stabilization of DPF2 in the nuclear fraction only with constructs containing the Repeat 2 (RPT2) domain (aa 259–319) of SMARCB1, confirming its critical role in mediating the integration of DPF2 into the BAF complex ( Figures S6 C–S6F). Importantly, cancer-associated mutations in DPF2 map to the Req helical domain abutting the RPT2 domain of SMARCB1 ( Figure 3 H).
Nucleosome binding is accompanied by large conformational changes in BAF complex modular structure. In the cryo-EM map of the BAF complex alone, the ATPase module sits on top of the core module, with the SMARCA4 subunit in close proximity to the SMARCB1 subunit ( Figure 4 A, left panel). Upon NCP binding, the ATPase module separates from the core module and rotates about the ARP module, creating space for the NCP and allowing the SMARCA4 and SMARCB1 subunits to attach to the NCP in a clamp-like grip ( Figure 4 A, right panel). This large conformational change is also supported by CX-MS, which revealed substantial differences in intra- and inter-subunit cross-links within the ATPase and ARP modules ( Figure 4 B) as well as in cross-links between other subunits/modules throughout the BAF complex between unbound and NCP-bound conditions ( Figure S6 G). Specifically, upon NCP binding, we detected fewer internal cross-links within the SMARCA4/2 subunits and more cross-links between the SMARCA4/2 HSA domain and the ARP-module subunits (ACTL6A and ACTB), suggesting that nucleosome binding and the associated repositioning of the ATPase module leads to reduced mobility of the ARP module and a more stable interaction with the SMARCA4 HSA helix.
To define the conformational variability of the BAF complex, we subjected the cryo-EM dataset to multi-body refinement in RELION-3 ( Nakane et al., 2018 32. Nakane, T. ∙ Kimanius, D. ∙ Lindahl, E. ... Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION eLife. 2018; 7 :e36861 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the BAF complex alone, we defined the three modules as separate bodies. The result of multi-body refinement indicated that the ATPase and ARP modules are flexibly tethered to the core module, presumably through the long HSA helix of SMARCA4. The analysis revealed two major movements of the ATPase and ARP modules relative to the core module: a swivel motion of ∼40° and a swing-out motion of ∼50° ( Figure 4 C; Video S4 ). The mobility of the ATPase and ARP modules relative to the core module likely facilitates nucleosome engagement. The ATPase module in the map of the BAF complex alone is positioned in the space that is occupied by the nucleosome in the map of the BAF-NCP complex. However, the amplitudes of the observed swivel and swing-out motions are sufficient to provide the rotation of ∼30° that is required to rotate the ATPase module into the orientation seen in the BAF-NCP complex. The ATPase module not only has to rotate, but also to separate from the core module to provide sufficient space for the NCP. Such an increased separation between the ATPase and core modules was not captured by the multi-body refinement, suggesting that it is either a rare event for the BAF complex alone or that the wider separation is induced only upon the initial nucleosome-binding event.

Multi-Body Refinement of BAF Alone, Motion 1 and 2, Related to Figure 4
For the BAF-NCP complex, we defined the nucleosome as one body, the ATPase and ARP modules together as a second body, and the core module as a third body. Surprisingly, multi-body refinement also showed substantial motions in the BAF-NCP complex: a rotation of the nucleosome by ∼35° about the contact points with the BAF complex and an ∼45° tilting movement of the ATPase and ARP modules relative to the nucleosome and core module ( Figure 4 D; Video S5 ), further confirmed by CX-MS data indicating that the ATPase module subunits bind various NCP core or tail interfaces, a significant number of which are mutated in cancer ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Based on the observed dynamics, we propose a mechanism of nucleosome engagement and chromatin remodeling driven by the structural dynamics of the BAF complex we observed ( Figure 4 G, model).

Multi-Body Refinement of BAF (NCP Bound), Motion 1 and 2, Related to Figure 4
The human BAF complex forms a bilateral H2A/H2B nucleosome acidic patch “clamp” ( Figure 5 A). The cryo-EM map showed additional helical density that connects to the acidic patch on the bottom face of the nucleosome, which was identified as the C-terminal α-helix of SMARCB1 ( Figure 5 A). Notably, this is consistent with recent results reporting that the C-terminal α-helical domain (aa 351–385) of SMARCB1 in isolation interacts with the nucleosome acidic patch ( Valencia et al., 2019 54. Valencia, A.M. ∙ Collings, C.K. ∙ Dao, H.T. ...

He, S. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Tian, Y. ... Structure of nucleosome-bound human BAF complex Science. 2020; 367 :875-881 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified mutations across a range of human cancer types along the SMARCB1 α-helix, with R377H/C/L, R366C/P, R374W/Q, and R370M/S/T representing the most recurrent mutations ( Figure 5 B). These data were further substantiated by CX-MS data revealing the highest frequencies of SMARCB1 missense mutations clustering within its NCP-binding region ( Figure 5 B, right). Further, mutations causative of the intellectual disability disorder Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) ( Tsurusaki et al., 2012 52. Tsurusaki, Y. ∙ Okamoto, N. ∙ Ohashi, H. ... Mutations affecting components of the SWI/SNF complex cause Coffin-Siris syndrome Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :376-378 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ) cluster in this region and have been shown to result in attenuation of ATP-dependent BAF remodeling activity in vitro and DNA accessibility in cells ( Valencia et al., 2019 54. Valencia, A.M. ∙ Collings, C.K. ∙ Dao, H.T. ... Recurrent SMARCB1 Mutations Reveal a Nucleosome Acidic Patch Interaction Site That Potentiates mSWI/SNF Complex Chromatin Remodeling Cell. 2019; 179 :1342-1356 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Importantly, on the opposing “top” face of the nucleosome, the map showed additional density not seen in the maps of the yeast SWI/SNF and recombinant human BAF complexes ( Figures 1 A and 3 C), which we identified in our model as the SnAc/post-SnAc domain (aa 1,307–1,418) of the SMARCA4/2 ATPase ( Figure S6 H). Importantly, this region was found to be recurrently mutated in human cancer ( Figure 5 C). We therefore sought to functionally characterize the interface between SMARCA4 and the acidic patch with respect to its role in chromatin remodeling activity. We expressed either empty vector control, or HA-tagged wild-type (WT) SMARCA4, post-SnAc mutant, or T910M ATPase-compromised SMARCA4 variants ( Pan et al., 2019 35. Pan, J. ∙ McKenzie, Z.M. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ... The ATPase module of mammalian SWI/SNF family complexes mediates subcomplex identity and catalytic activity-independent genomic targeting Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :618-626 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 5 D–5F). We performed HA immunoprecipitations (IPs) to capture complexes containing either WT or mutant SMARCA4, incubated these with mononucleosomes, and subsequently performed chromatin remodeling assays (REAA) to define any changes in BAF-mediated chromatin remodeling activity ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Intriguingly, both deletion of an 11-aa region within the SMARCA4 post-SnAc domain or a single-residue point mutation (R1411Q) reduced the chromatin-remodeling activity compared to complexes containing WT SMARCA4. The T910M ATPase-deficient mutant almost entirely eliminated the remodeling activity, consistent with prior studies that indicated its compromised remodeling capacity genome-wide in cells ( Pan et al., 2019 35. Pan, J. ∙ McKenzie, Z.M. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ... The ATPase module of mammalian SWI/SNF family complexes mediates subcomplex identity and catalytic activity-independent genomic targeting Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :618-626 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 5 E and 5F). We further confirmed the role for the SMARCA4 SnAc/post-SnAc domain in the setting of SMARCB1 deletion, revealing that mutations in this region of SMARCA4 further exacerbated the inhibition of residual chromatin-remodeling activities mediated by the SMARCA4 ATPase that are caused by SMARCB1 perturbation ( Figures 5 G–5I). These data demonstrate the functional importance of the bilateral nucleosome-interaction surfaces for the BAF complex to attain its maximum chromatin-remodeling activity.
Given that the SMARCA4 ATPase is the most extensively interfaced subunit and that it contains the most single-residue (missense) mutations in cancer ( Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015 19. Kadoch, C. ∙ Crabtree, G.R. Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes and cancer: Mechanistic insights gained from human genomics Sci. Adv. 2015; 1 :e1500447 Crossref Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ; St Pierre and Kadoch, 2017 48. St Pierre, R. ∙ Kadoch, C. Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes in cancer: emerging therapeutic opportunities Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2017; 42 :56-67 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), we mapped the full set of SMARCA4/SMARCA2 human cancer (COSMIC database) mutation frequencies onto the SMARCA4 ATPase structure ( Figure 6 A). We found that several recurrent hot-spot mutations localize directly to interactions between the HSA domain and the ARM-repeat region (CBR) of the ARID1A/B subunits ( Figure 6 B). Reciprocally, mapping of missense mutations (single-residue changes) on ARID1A indicated several additional hotspots at sites of SMARCA4 HSA interaction ( Figure 6 B), indicating that this region is a major hub for structural compromise in cancer and in agreement with the dynamic interactions observed between the ATPase and core modules ( Figure 4 ). We find that SMARCA4 mutations are clustered in four key regions: the catalytic helicase domains, the HSA domain (near the ARP module-interaction surfaces), the core-insertion site, and the pre-HSA/anchor regions. Notably, we found that recurrent and previously uncharacterized mutational hotspots occur at key residues within protein “turn” regions within the SMARCA4 subunit, such as R441W/Q (interface with ARID1A), R451H (bottom of the HSA domain), and R408W/Q (pre-HSA anchor region) ( Figures 6 A and 6C). Notably, we found that both SMARCA4 R408W and R441W “hinge” mutations reduced BAF-mediated chromatin-remodeling activity on mononucleosome substrates, suggesting that the coordination of the ATPase subunit positioning and its dynamic movement within the core module is required for the BAF complex to reach its maximum chromatin-remodeling activity ( Figures 6 D–6F).
We next used the BAF-NCP complex model to comprehensively define the structural regions and interfaces that are affected by the full collection of recurrent, single-residue human cancer mutations identified to date (COSMIC database), including TCGA driver mutations ( Bailey et al., 2018 3. Bailey, M.H. ∙ Tokheim, C. ∙ Porta-Pardo, E. ..., MC3 Working Group, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations Cell. 2018; 173 :371-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1273) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 7 A and S7 A). We identified mutations in the SMARCA4/2 ATPase subunits outside of the helicase regions, namely the R1232S/C/D/V and R973Q/W/L mutations, as well as a number of mutations within the large core module, both at subunit interfaces and exposed surfaces. For example, we found mutations mapping to the helical regions of SMARCD1 (Q457H/C and A490V/T/E) and SMARCC2 (I901M) as well as other regions within ARID1A (i.e., G2087R/E within the ARM-repeat region that tethers multiple subunits within the core). Owing to incomplete conservation between human BAF and the yeast RSC and SWI/SNF complexes as well as regions/domains excluded from these models, the endogenous BAF complex structure allowed mapping of the highest percentage of cancer-associated missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations ( Figure 7 B). A large percentage of mutations agreed with respect to positioning in the models of the endogenous and recombinant complexes ( Figures S7 B and S7C). CX-MS data for the endogenous BAF-NCP complex further identified subunit-subunit and subunit-nucleosome interactions that were recurrently mutated in cancer, including those involving mammalian-specific subunits and subunit domains such as BCL7A, the N terminus of ARID1A, and others ( Figure 7 C).
We also classified all mutations in terms of their localization to subunit-subunit interfaces (within a given BAF module), module-module interfaces, or subunit-NCP interfaces (broken down by subunit-histone folds or subunit-histone tails) ( Figures 7 D and 7E). 70% of missense mutations occurred at structurally important subunit-subunit interfaces within the core module, 19% in total were predicted to disrupt subunit-NCP interfaces, and 11% were predicted to affect the catalytic activity (ATPase helicase and ARP modules) of the complex ( Figure 7 F). Our structural model, including these categories, collectively encompasses 44% of all human cancer-associated missense mutations in BAF complex genes (COSMIC database), suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms leading to BAF complex perturbation, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms leading to BAF complex perturbation that remain to be characterized, such as those affecting solvent-exposed surfaces of the BAF complex, disordered or structurally unresolved regions, reader domains, subunit stability and degradation, or the interactions of BAF complexes with other factors ( Figure S7 D).

Section: Discussion

In this study, we have generated the first structural models of the endogenous human canonical BAF complex and used these to inform the impact of disease-associated mutations. Importantly, because we did not use recombinantly produced material but instead endogenous BAF complexes purified from human cells, the resulting cryo-EM maps, subunit-subunit and subunit-NCP cross-links identified by CX-MS, and the deduced structural model represent those of the fully assembled, canonical BAF complex. Although the extensive compositional heterogeneity, flexibility, and dynamics inherent to endogenous BAF complexes limited the resolution of the final cryo-EM composite map, we were able to use it in conjunction with CX-MS and advanced modeling techniques to generate a model, allowing for the localization of additional human-specific subunits and subunit domains to unassigned densities and resulting in the most complete picture of the human BAF complex achieved to date.
Extensive further work will be needed to reveal the interactions between BAF complexes and nucleosomes containing single and combinatorial histone post-translational modifications as well as distinct histone core variants. For example, the resolution for the SMARCA4 bromodomain and the tandem PHD domains that require acetylated/crotonylated histone H3 tails for binding ( Xiong et al., 2016 60. Xiong, X. ∙ Panchenko, T. ∙ Yang, S. ... Selective recognition of histone crotonylation by double PHD fingers of MOZ and DPF2 Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12 :1111-1118 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zeng et al., 2010 65. Zeng, L. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Li, S. ... Mechanism and regulation of acetylated histone binding by the tandem PHD finger of DPF3b Nature. 2010; 466 :258-262 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ) was limited. Indeed, incubation of BAF complexes with differentially modified nucleosomes could change their binding orientations, stability, and their activities, and will likely allow for the determination of higher-resolution and/or more complete structures. Other areas of the complex that were not resolved in our model include DNA-binding domains such as the SMARCE1 HMG, the ARID1A/B ARID, and the SMARCB1 WH domains, mutations in which have been implicated in human neurodevelopmental diseases ( Tsurusaki et al., 2012 52. Tsurusaki, Y. ∙ Okamoto, N. ∙ Ohashi, H. ... Mutations affecting components of the SWI/SNF complex cause Coffin-Siris syndrome Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 :376-378 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar , 2014 53. Tsurusaki, Y. ∙ Okamoto, N. ∙ Ohashi, H. ... Coffin-Siris syndrome is a SWI/SNF complex disorder Clin. Genet. 2014; 85 :548-554 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wieczorek et al., 2013 58. Wieczorek, D. ∙ Bögershausen, N. ∙ Beleggia, F. ... A comprehensive molecular study on Coffin-Siris and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes identifies a broad molecular and clinical spectrum converging on altered chromatin remodeling Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22 :5121-5135 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such domains could potentially be visualized by using longer extra-nucleosomal DNA to stabilize them, especially considering that these subunits, based on this model and others, do not interact with nucleosomal DNA. In addition, beyond inhibition of nucleosome remodeling, we anticipate a range of mechanisms for human disease-associated missense mutations, such as changes in protein stability, gain-of-function enzymatic activities, altered interactions with transcription factors, and others.
In addition to inherent heterogeneity, another major challenge in structurally characterizing endogenous human BAF complexes is their higher content of IDP regions compared to their yeast or recombinant counterparts ( Figure S7 D). Indeed, several endogenous human-specific components, such as SS18, BCL7A, and the entire N terminus of ARID1A, contain low-complexity sequences, which may contribute to activities beyond canonical chromatin remodeling.
Taken together, we hope that this model of the endogenous human BAF complex will serve as a powerful initial foundation that will assist investigators in defining the consequences of disease-specific perturbations, functionally grouping mutations, linking these to gene expression and physiologic outcomes, and identifying therapeutic opportunities.

HEK293T and HEK293T LentiX cells were cultured in standard DMEM medium (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Omega), 1X GlutaMAX (GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . HEK293F cells were cultured in 3- to 15-l spinner flasks (Corning) in SFM II medium (GIBCO) supplemented with GlutaMAX (GIBCO) and Poloxamer (Sigma).
Escherichia coli BL21 Rosetta2 cells (Novagen) were used for the expression of the NCP octamer proteins (in inclusion bodies). Growth and protein expression conditions are outlined in Method Details .
Human BAF complexes were purified as described before ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ), with several modifications. Briefly, a HEK293F cell line stably expressing HA-tagged DPF2 was cultured in spinner flasks in SFM II medium supplemented with GlutaMAX and Poloxamer. Cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4°C at 4000 g. Pellets were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (GIBCO). Cell suspension was then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4°C at 4000 g. Cell pellets were resuspended in HB (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF) and homogenized in Dounce homogenizers. The suspension was pelleted for 30 minutes at 4°C at 4000 g and nuclear pellets were resuspended in pre- extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM, 0.1% (v/v) NP40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail. After pelleting for 10 minutes at 4°C at 4000 g, chromatin was resuspended in high-salt buffer (HSB; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM, 1% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated with rotation for one hour at 4°C. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm in a SW32Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 1 hour at 4°C and the supernatant collected. Nuclear extracts were filtered with a 0.45-μm filter and rotated overnight at 4°C with HA magnetic resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The beads were washed in HSB and proteins were eluted by incubating the beads 4 times for 1.5 hours with 1 mg/mL of HA peptide in HSB.
Samples of purified canonical BAF complexes were run on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel, stained using the Colloidal blue kit (Invitrogen) and imaged using an LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences)
For cryo-EM and cross-linking mass spectrometry studies, human histones were purified as described ( An and Roeder, 2004 1. An, W. ∙ Roeder, R.G. Reconstitution and transcriptional analysis of chromatin in vitro Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377 :460-474 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, individual histones were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 Rosetta2 cells (Novagen) and successively purified over Sephacryl S-200 (GE Healthcare) and SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) columns. Individual histones were then reconstituted into an octamer that was further purified and separated through a final gel filtration step at high salt. When required, prepared histones were stored at −80°C in 2 M NaCl, 30% glycerol, TE buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) at a minimal concentration of 1 mg/mL. Histone concentrations were determined by Coomassie blue staining with BSA standards. Histone octamers were then formed and purified as described ( Ruthenburg et al., 2011 41. Ruthenburg, A.J. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Milne, T.A. ... Recognition of a mononucleosomal histone modification pattern by BPTF via multivalent interactions Cell. 2011; 145 :692-706 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, individual lyophilized histones were dissolved in a denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6.3 M guanidine, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and mixed in stoichiometric amounts. After incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C to ensure complete denaturation, the mixture was dialyzed against three changes of refolding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), and octamers were purified over a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the refolding buffer.
Mononucleosome assembly was carried out according to established methods ( Luger et al., 1999 26. Luger, K. ∙ Rechsteiner, T.J. ∙ Richmond, T.J. Expression and purification of recombinant histones and nucleosome reconstitution Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119 :1-16 PubMed Google Scholar ). To amplify the 601 template with 25-bp linker DNA (for 25-bp overhangs on each side with nucleosome centered), PCR was performed using the tandem 601 template described in Shimada et al. (2019) 43. Shimada, M. ∙ Chen, W.Y. ∙ Nakadai, T. ... Gene-Specific H1 Eviction through a Transcriptional Activator→p300→NAP1→H1 Pathway Mol.

After the initial PCR reaction, the fragment containing a single 601 sequence was purified from an agarose gel, and PCR was repeated with this fragment as template. Mononucleosomes were assembled by salt dilution ( Cirillo et al., 2002 7. Cirillo, L.A. ∙ Lin, F.R. ∙ Cuesta, I. ... Opening of compacted chromatin by early developmental transcription factors HNF3 (FoxA) and GATA-4 Mol. Cell. 2002; 9 :279-289 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (937) PubMed Google Scholar ). 1 μM 601 template was mixed with an equimolar amount of histone octamers in assembly buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% NP-40, 1 mM DTT) containing 2 M NaCl, at a final volume of 10 μL. The NaCl concentration was sequentially diluted by adding at 15-minute intervals 3.3 μL, 6.7 μL, 5 μL, 3.6 μL, 4.7 μL, 6.7 μL, 10 μL, 30 μL, and 20 μL of the assembly buffer containing no NaCl, while the reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C. Nucleosome assembly was confirmed by running the sample on a 4.5% native acrylamide gel and staining with SYBR Gold stain (Invitrogen). After confirming nucleosome assembly, the reaction mixture was further dialyzed overnight against binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT) and heated at 37°C for 30 minutes before forming a complex with BAF.

SMARCA4 (BRG1) levels of the HA-purified BAF complex purifications were normalized via BCA protein quantification and immunoblotting analyses. Purified canonical BAF complexes were diluted for final reaction concentration of 10 ng/μL in REAA buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 ) containing 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 1 μM DTT, 20 nM nucleosomes (EpiDyne Nucleosome Remodeling Assay Substrate ST601-GATC1, EpiCypher). The REAA mixture was incubated at 30 or 37°C for 10 minutes, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 1-2 mM ATP (Ultrapure ATP, Promega) and 0.005 U/μL DpnII Restriction Enzyme (New England Biolabs). The REAA reaction mixture was quenched with 20-24 mM EDTA and placed on ice. Proteinase K (Ambion) was added at (100 μg/mL) for 30-60 minutes, followed by either AMPure bead DNA purification and D1000 HS DNA ScreenTape Analysis (Agilent)
Constitutive expression of N-terminally HA-tagged DPF2 (used for cBAF purification) as well as N-terminally V5-tagged full-length WT or mutant SMARCB1 (BAF47) or N-terminally HA-tagged SMARCA4 (BRG1) were used for expression in either HEK293T or HEK293T SMARCB1Δ/Δ cells, achieved using lentiviral infection of an EF1α-driven expression vector (modified pTight vector from Clontech, dual promoter EF-1a-MCS-PGK-Puro or EF-1a-MCS-PGK-Blast), selected with puromycin (2 μg/μL, Sigma-Aldrich) or blasticidin (10 μg/mL, Thermo Fisher).
Lentiviral particles were prepared using LentiX HEK293T packaging cells (Clontech) via polyethylenimine (PEI, Sigma)-mediated transfection of gene delivery vector co-transfected with packaging vectors pspax2 and pMD2.G as previously described ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supernatants were harvested 72 hours after transfection and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm using an SW32Ti rotor for 2.5 hours at 4°C. Virus-containing pellets were resuspended in PBS, pH 7.4 (GIBCO), and placed on cells dropwise.
HEK293T cells were lentivirally infected with either empty vector, or HA-DPF2, or V5-SMARCB1 constructs or HA-SMARCA4 constructs for 48 hours and then selected with puromycin (2 μg/μL) or blasticidin (10 μg/mL), split at 72 hours and continued with selection for 5 days. Cells were harvested for experiments 7 days post-infection or scaled and expanded for cBAF complex purification.
For the BAF complex alone, the complex eluted from the anti-HA beads was loaded on top of a 11-mL linear 10%–30% (v/v) glycerol and 0%–0.08% (v/v) glutaraldehyde GraFix gradient in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT in accordance with the modified GraFix protocol ( Stark, 2010 49. Stark, H. GraFix: stabilization of fragile macromolecular complexes for single particle cryo-EM Methods Enzymol. 2010; 481 :109-126 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Centrifugation was carried out at 40,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor for 16 hours at 4°C. 550 μL fractions were manually collected from the top of the gradient and quenched with Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at a final concentration of 50 mM. Fractions containing BAF complex were concentrated and diluted three times in an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore; 50-kDa cut-off) with glycerol- and glutaraldehyde-free buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). The concentrated samples were used for cryo-EM specimen preparation.
For the BAF–NCP complex, the complex eluted from the anti-HA beads was dialyzed overnight against binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT) and mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of the mononucleosome substrate. The mixture was supplemented with 1 mM AMP-PNP (Sigma), incubated for 2 hours at 4°C and then loaded on top of a 11-mL linear 10%–40% sucrose and 0%–0.08% glutaraldehyde gradient in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 μM AMP-PNP. Centrifugation was carried out at 37,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor for 14 hours at 4°C. 550 μL fractions were manually collected from the top of the gradient and quenched with Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at a final concentration of 50 mM. Fractions containing BAF–NCP complex were concentrated in an Amicon Ultra concentrator (50-kDa cutoff; Millipore) and then subjected to a Zeba Spin Desalting Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 50 μM AMP-PNP. AMP-PNP at a final concentration of 1 mM was added to the eluted sample before preparing cryo-EM specimens.
To prepare cryo-EM grids, 4 μL of the samples were applied to Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 mesh Cu holey carbon grids (Quantifoil) covered with a homemade thin carbon film, and then blotted for 1-1.5 s and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 4°C and 100% humidity.
Cryo-EM data were collected on 200-kV Talos Acrtica electron microscopes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the Cryo-EM Resource Center at The Rockefeller University (RU) or at the Cryo-Electron Microscopy Laboratory at New York University (NYU) Langone Health, both equipped with a K2 Summit direct detector, in super-resolution counting mode using the SerialEM software ( Mastronarde, 2005 28. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3217) PubMed Google Scholar ). After binning over 2x2 pixels, the calibrated pixel sizes were 1.5 (RU) and 1.45 Å (NYU) on the specimen level. Exposures of 15 s were dose-fractionated into 50 frames with a dose rate of 10 electrons pixel -1 s -1 . Defocus values ranging from −1.0 to −3.5 μm were used. Cryo-EM data collection statistics are summarized in Table S1 .
Image processing was performed in RELION-2.1 and −3.0 ( Kimanius et al., 2016 23. Kimanius, D. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ∙ Scheres, S.H. ...

A Bayesian approach to beam-induced motion correction in cryo-EM single-particle analysis IUCrJ. 2019; 6 :5-17 Crossref Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). All movie frames were corrected with a gain reference collected during the same EM session, and specimen movement was corrected using MotionCor2 with dose weighting and 2x2 binning ( Zheng et al., 2017 67. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ). The contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated from the movie frames using CTFFIND-4.1.5 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 40. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ). Images showing substantial ice contamination, abnormal background, thick ice, low contrast or poor Thon rings were discarded.
For the BAF complex alone, 4,866 images were selected from 6 datasets for further processing. Particles were automatically selected from the aligned and dose-weighted images using Gautomatch ( https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/download/gautomatch-056/ ) and windowed into 260x260-pixel images. The particles of each dataset were separately subjected to two rounds of 2D classification, and classes that produced poor averages were discarded. From the first dataset, ∼25,000 particles were selected from good 2D classes and used to generate an initial density map in cryoSPARC (Structura Biotechnology) ( Punjani et al., 2017 39. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ). The particles after 2D clean-up from all six datasets were combined, and the selected 596,957 particles were subjected to 3D classification into four classes. Two of the resulting classes were combined and subjected to a second round of 3D classification into four classes using the local search option with a mask for the lower lobe. The resulting class showing the clearest features was used for focused 3D refinement using the same mask, yielding the final density map for the lower lobe at a resolution of 7.8 Å (FSC = 0.143, Figure S1 H).
For the BAF–NCP complex, 9,928 micrographs were selected from 10 datasets of complexes formed with nucleosomes containing non-modified histone cores (BAF–Nuc), and 4,913 micrographs were selected from 5 datasets of complexes formed with nucleosomes containing H3K14-acetylated histones (BAF–H3K14AcNuc). Particles were automatically picked from the aligned and dose-weighted micrographs using Gautomatch. The particle coordinates were used to extract particles into 290x290-pixel images (RU) or 300x300-pixel images (NYU). The images were rescaled into 256x256-pixel images, resulting in a pixel size of 1.7 Å. The particles of each dataset were separately subjected to two rounds of 2D classification, and classes that produced poor averages were discarded. From a pilot dataset of BAF in complex with unmodified nucleosome, ∼36,000 particles were selected after 2D clean-up and used to generate three ab-initio maps in cryoSPARC. One of the maps showed no density for a bound nucleosome, whereas another one showed clear density for a bound nucleosome. These two maps were used as initial reference maps for supervised 3D classification of the particles after 2D clean-up. The particles assigned to the map of the nucleosome-bound BAF complex were subjected to another round of 2D classification to identify and discard classes that produced poor averages. The remaining 603,173 and 274,804 particles from the datasets of the BAF–Nuc and BAF–H3K14AcNuc complexes, respectively, were combined and subjected to an initial 3D refinement with global alignment. The refined map was used to generate masks for the nucleosome, the nucleosome plus the ATPase-ARP module, and the nucleosome plus the ‘arm’ module. These masks were used to subject the particles to focused 3D classification into 6 classes, using the local search option. In all cases, the classes containing the most particles showed the best-resolved features of the bound nucleosome, containing 267,544, 185,959 and 281,723 particles, respectively. Independent refinement of the best classes for the nucleosome, the nucleosome plus the ATPase-ARP module, and the nucleosome plus the ‘arm’ module yielded maps at resolutions of 5.6, 6.2 and 5.9 Å, respectively (FSC = 0.143, Figure S2 G)
For multi-body refinement in RELION-3.0 ( Nakane et al., 2018 32. Nakane, T. ∙ Kimanius, D. ∙ Lindahl, E. ... Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION eLife. 2018; 7 :e36861 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ), the refined particles (89,104 particles) from the last focused refinement of the BAF complex alone were subjected to global 3D refinement without mask (consensus refinement), and then the refined map was used to create maps for three bodies: lower lobe (body 1), ARP module (body 2) and ATPase module (body 3). Multi-body refinement was continued from the last iteration of the consensus refinement, with a sigma angle of 10 and a sigma offset of 2. Principal component analysis for all the particles was performed using relion_flex_analyse implemented in RELION-3.0 ( Nakane et al., 2018 32. Nakane, T. ∙ Kimanius, D. ∙ Lindahl, E. ... Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION eLife. 2018; 7 :e36861 Crossref Scopus (316) PubMed Google Scholar ). Principal components 1 and 2 accounted for ∼25% of the variance in the rotations and translations.
Eluted BAF complex was dialyzed overnight against 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% sucrose, 1 mM DTT and mixed with a 3-fold molar excess of mononucleosomes. The mixture was incubated with 1 mM AMP-PNP (Sigma) for 2 hours at 4°C. Sample was cross-linked with 3 mM BS3 for 3 hours and loaded on top of a 11-mL linear 10%–40% sucrose gradient in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. Centrifugation was carried out at 37,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor for 16 hours at 4°C. 550 μL fractions were manually collected from the top of the gradient and quenched with Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at a final concentration of 50 mM. Fractions containing BAF–NCP complex were concentrated in an Amicon Ultra concentrator (30-kDa cutoff; Millipore).
Sample was prepared according to a previously described preparation protocol using SP3 beads ( Hughes et al., 2014 17. Hughes, C.S. ∙ Foehr, S. ∙ Garfield, D.A. ... Ultrasensitive proteome analysis using paramagnetic bead technology Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10 :757 Crossref Scopus (697) PubMed Google Scholar ): 10 μL of SP3 beads (10 μg/μL) and an equal volume of acetonitrile was added to the cross-linked sample and incubated at 60°C for 30 minutes with shaking. Due to the high concentration of sucrose, the solution separated into two phases. The beads were concentrated with a magnet and washed with 100% acetonitrile. The beads were then resuspended in 100 μL 8 M urea in 1 M ammonium bicarbonate and treated with TCEP/CAA for 1 hour at 37°C in the dark. The bead supernatant was evaporated and the dried proteins were resuspended in 8 M urea in 1 M ammonium bicarbonate and treated with TCEP/CAA for 1 hour at 37°C in the dark. Both samples were diluted 10 times with water and digested by addition of trypsin (protein:trypsin ratio of 20:1,) overnight at 37°C.
The digested peptides were desalted by passage over C18 cartridges (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA), and dried by speed-vac. The peptides from both digests were resuspended in 50 μL Buffer A (25 mM ammonium formate, pH 2.8, 20% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) and combined. 1 μg of sample was reserved for MS analysis and the remaining sample was fractionated using an in-house prepared microcapillary strong cation-exchange column (200 mm X 20 cm; Proteomix SCX 3um, Sepax Technologies). We used a binary HPLC pump with split flow with microcapillary flowrate at 2-3 μL/minute. Peptides were loaded onto the microcapillary column equilibrated in Buffer A and washed with Buffer A. Bound peptides were eluted with 20 μL of Buffer A containing 30%, 50%, 70%, and 100% Buffer B (800 mM ammonium formate, pH 2.8, 20% acetonitrile), followed by a 50 μL elution with Buffer D (0.5 M ammonium acetate, 30% acetonitrile). All fractions were dried in a speed-vac, and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 2% acetonitrile.
Peptides were analyzed by electrospray ionization microcapillary reverse phase HPLC mass spectrometry on a Thermo Scientific Fusion instrument with HCD fragmentation and serial MS events that included one FTMS1 event at 30,000 resolution followed by FTMS2 events at 15,000 resolution. Other instrument settings included: MS1 scan range (m/z): 400-1500; cycle time 3 s; Charge states 4-10; Filters MIPS on, relax restriction = true; Dynamic exclusion enabled: repeat count 1, exclusion duration 30 s; Filter IntensityThreshold, signal intensity 50000; Isolation mode, quadrupole; Isolation window 2 Da; HCD normalized collision energy 28%, isolation width 2 Da; AGC target 500,000, Max injection time 200 ms. A 90-minute gradient from 5% ACN to 40% ACN was used.
Model building was carried out in two phases: First homology models were generated for individual domains, proteins, and subcomplexes, which were then assembled using density-guided docking. All modeled chains were first aligned with the corresponding chain in the yeast SWI/SNF complex using ‘hhalign’ from the HHsearch suite ( Söding, 2005 46. Söding, J. Protein homology detection by HMM-HMM comparison Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :951-960 Crossref Scopus (1967) PubMed Google Scholar ). HH-suite was also used for homology detection and annotation ( Steinegger et al., 2019 50. Steinegger, M. ∙ Meier, M. ∙ Mirdita, M. ... HH-suite3 for fast remote homology detection and deep protein annotation BMC Bioinformatics. 2019; 20 :473 Crossref Scopus (558) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, ‘hhpred’ was used to identify other detectable homologs (and to generate alignments for components that had no homolog in the structure of the yeast complex). RosettaCM was then used to perform homology modeling starting from all detected (up to 10) alignments for each domain ( Song et al., 2013 47. Song, Y. ∙ DiMaio, F. ∙ Wang, R.Y. ... High-resolution comparative modeling with RosettaCM Structure. 2013; 21 :1735-1742 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (813) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fleishman et al., 2011 12. Fleishman, S.J. ∙ Leaver-Fay, A. ∙ Corn, J.E. ... RosettaScripts: a scripting language interface to the Rosetta macromolecular modeling suite PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e20161 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequence insertions of 13 residues or longer were not modeled. Next, Rosetta ab initio folding was carried out on all other domains predicted to be globular ( Ovchinnikov et al., 2018 34. Ovchinnikov, S. ∙ Park, H. ∙ Kim, D.E. ... Protein structure prediction using Rosetta in CASP12 Proteins. 2018; 86 :113-121 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). This procedure yielded models for 8 domains predicted from homologs and for 2 domains with well-converged ab initio ensembles. For each domain (unless specified otherwise below), approximately 200 models were generated with RosettaCM, and 5,000 models were generated with Rosetta ab initio ( Simons et al., 1999a 44. Simons, K.T. ∙ Ruczinski, I. ∙ Kooperberg, C. ... Improved recognition of native-like protein structures using a combination of sequence-dependent and sequence-independent features of proteins Proteins. 1999; 34 :82-95 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ). Convergence of ab initio models were assessed by inspecting the top five models by energy, and divergent ensembles were not considered for the subsequent assembly phase.
• SMARCE – Since secondary structure prediction and manual inspection of cross-links suggested that a long region of SMARCE forms a single long helix, an ideal helical model was built parametrically using PyRosetta and docked manually into the density (using UCSF Chimera) ( Chaudhury et al., 2010 6. Chaudhury, S. ∙ Lyskov, S. ∙ Gray, J.J. PyRosetta: a script-based interface for implementing molecular modeling algorithms using Rosetta Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :689-691 Crossref Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). 17 different sequence registrations were then sampled and refined with RosettaCM. Over 100 models were generated, and the best-scoring models all converged on a single sequence registration. • SMARCC1 – This subunit was built using a combination of Rosetta ab initio and RosettaCM. The N terminus was built using the yeast homolog, while the C terminus was built ab initio. The two models shared a helix, which allowed the models to be aligned to a common reference frame and to be refined together using RosettaCM. • SMARCB1 helix bound to NCP acidic patch – Using a novel NMR structure of the SMARCB1 helix, we docked the helix against the lower acidic patch of the NCP using Rosetta’s dock_pdb_into_density tool ( Wang et al., 2015 56. Wang, R.Y. ∙ Kudryashev, M. ∙ Li, X. ... De novo protein structure determination from near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM maps Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :335-338 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple docking solutions were subjected to RosettaCM, and a final converged model yielded a helix that fit the density well and also interfaced well with the acidic patch. This final helix was combined with the model of the SMARCB1 core, and the gaps in sequence were filled in with RosettaCM. • DPF2 NTD – trRosetta ( Yang et al., 2020 62. Yang, J. ∙ Anishchenko, I. ∙ Park, H. ... Improved protein structure prediction using predicted interresidue orientations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :1496-1503 Crossref Scopus (906) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to generate 150 models, of which the top 5 (scored by Rosetta energy) were selected. The first 50 residues of these models all converged very well, so that the first 50 residues of the top scoring model were used in subsequent steps. Using TMalign ( Zhang and Skolnick, 2005 66. Zhang, Y. ∙ Skolnick, J. TM-align: a protein structure alignment algorithm based on the TM-score Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :2302-2309 Crossref Scopus (2318) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the RSC structure (PDB: 6V8O ) as template, we found significant structural similarity of these 50 residues to RSC7 (TM-score 0.55). By aligning the RSC SFH1 to SMARCB1 in Chimera, we were able to use the RSC7–SFH1 complex as a template to place our DPF2 residues into the cryo-EM map, which yielded a good fit to density. The first 13 residues of our DPF2 NTD did not fit the density and did not align well with the SFH1 template and were therefore removed, allowing the structure to be slightly better aligned with the template (TM-score 0.60).
To simplify model assembly, three sub-complexes were assembled separately: 1) the ATPase and the NCP, 2) the actin-like domains and the SMARCA4 helix, and 3) the lower lobe containing all remaining models.
ATPase + NCP . Models of the ATPase were manually docked into the density in UCSF Chimera, using as a guide the structure of the Snf2–nucleosome complex (PDB: 5X0Y ). However, the cryo-EM density suggested multiple differences from the template: in the context of the BAF complex, the ATPase appeared to adopt a more extended conformation, and there appeared to be additional density near the C terminus of the ATPase domain that was not resolved in the crystal structure and extended to an acidic patch on the NCP. We therefore used RosettaCM iteratively to both refine the ATPase into the density and to build an additional 28 C-terminal residues. Five rounds of RosettaCM were run. Each round generated thirty models that served as input for the subsequent round, a strategy that has proven very powerful for structure refinement ( Park et al., 2019 36. Park, H. ∙ Lee, G.R. ∙ Kim, D.E. ... High-accuracy refinement using Rosetta in CASP13 Proteins. 2019; 87 :1276-1282 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). A fit-to-density energy term was included in RosettaCM modeling.
Actin-like domains + SMARCA4 helix . Assembly of these domains was guided by the crystal structure of the Arp7–Arp9–Snf2(HSA)–RTT102 subcomplex (PDB: 4I6M ). Homology models of ACTL6A, ACTB, and the SMARCA4 helix were aligned to the reference structure, refined in RosettaCM, and docked into the density using UCSF Chimera. Models in which the placement of the actin domains ACTL6A and ACTB were swapped were also built, and cross-linking constraints (between ACTL6A and ARID1A) were used to identify which placement was correct.
Lower lobe. The domain placement into the cryo-EM map of the lower lobe was guided by the structure of the yeast SWI/SNF complex (PDB: 6UXW ). To achieve a better match to the cryo-EM density, the yeast SWI/SNF complex structure of the lower lobe was partitioned into three subcomplexes: 1) ARID1A, 2) the N-termini of SMARCC1 + N-termini of SMARCC2 + SMARCB, and 3) C-termini of SMARCC1 + C-termini of SMARCC2 + SMARCC. Homology models of the human BAF subunits were aligned to the three subcomplexes and then individually docked into the cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera. After refining the entire subcomplex with RosettaCM, SMARCE and the DPF2 NTD were added. For all domains except SMARCE, we again used Rosetta’s dock_pdb_into_density tool to find all possible placements of each model guided by the density and evaluated each placement against the cross-linking data.
A final refinement of the entire assembled complex was carried out with RosettaCM to improve inter-subunit geometry as well as improving the fit to density.
Nuclear extracts isolated from HEK293T and HEK293T SMARCB1Δ/Δ cells were prepared as described ( Mashtalir et al., 2018 27. Mashtalir, N. ∙ D’Avino, A.R. ∙ Michel, B.C. ... Modular Organization and Assembly of SWI/SNF Family Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cell. 2018; 175 :1272-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, cells were scraped from plates, washed with cold PBS, pelleted in a TX-200 rotor at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C, and resuspended in EB0 hypotonic buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl 2 , supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche) and 1 mM PMSF). Lysates were pelleted at 4,000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were discarded, and nuclei were resuspended in EB300 high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl 2 , supplemented with protease inhibitor and 1 mM PMSF). Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 minutes with occasional vortexing. Lysates were then pelleted at 21,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were quantified using the bicinchonic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Finally, samples were supplemented with 1 mM DTT.
For immunoprecipitation, nuclear extracts and subsequent REAA assays, 700 μg of nuclear extract (at 1 μg/μL) were incubated with 2-5 μg of antibody overnight at 4°C. Dynabeads (Pierce Protein G Magnetic Beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were then added, rotated for 2 hours at 4°C, and washed 3-5 times with EB300. Complexes were used either still bound to the beads for REAA or eluted with sample buffer (2X NuPAGE LDS Buffer (Invitrogen) and 200 mM DTT) for SDS-PAGE analysis.
Western blot analysis was performed using standard procedures. For western blots visualizing mSWI/SNF complex subunits, samples were separated using a 4%–12% Bis-Tris PAGE gel (NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel, Invitrogen), and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-FL, EMD Millipore). For western blots visualizing histones, samples were separated using a 10%–20% tricine gel (Novex 10%–20% Tricine Protein Gel, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-PSQ, EMD Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-Tween (PBST 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated with primary antibody for 3 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed 3 times with PBST and then incubated with near-infrared fluorophore-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies (LI-COR) for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 times with PBST, once with PBS, and then imaged using a Li-Cor Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR).
Unless otherwise noted, all p values were determined using a two-tailed t test (Student’s t test).

For cross-linked peptide searches, we used two different cross-link database searching algorithms: pLink2 ( Yang et al., 2012 63. Yang, B. ∙ Wu, Y.J. ∙ Zhu, M. ... Identification of cross-linked peptides from complex samples Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :904-906 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the in-house designed Nexus algorithm. For pLink2 searches, a database containing BAF subunit and histone sequences was used with fixed modification Carbamidomethyl [C] and variable modifications: Oxidation [M], Gln- > pyro-Glu [AnyN-term], Glu- > pyro-Glu [AnyN-term], Xlink_DSS [K] and Xlink_DSS [ProteinN-term].
For Nexus searches, the same database was used with the following parameter settings: (a) up to three miscleavages; (b) static modification on cysteines (+57.0215 Da); (c) differential oxidation modification on methionines (+15.9949 Da); (d) differential modification on the peptide N-terminal glutamic acid residues (−18.0106 Da) or N-terminal glutamine residues (−17.0265 Da); (e) differential mono-BS3 modification on lysine residue (+156.0806 Da). A 5% of false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff was used for both pLink2 and Nexus searches. After performing the pLink2 and Nexus analyses, the search results were combined and each spectrum was manually evaluated for the quality of the match to each peptide using the COMET/Lorikeet Spectrum Viewer (TPP). Cross-linked peptides are considered confidently identified if at least 4 consecutive b or y ions for each peptide are observed and the majority of the observed ions are accounted for. Search results that did not meet these criteria were removed. Intra-links involving a cross-link between identical residues were only kept if the spectral evidence strongly supported the identification; that is, the major fragment ions correspond to the intra-linked peptide sequence and no/few other fragment ions were observed. 4.9% of inter-linked and 5.4% of intra-linked spectra were removed after manual examination. Spectra and cross-link maps can be viewed at https://www.yeastrc.org/proxl_public/viewProject.do?project_id=258 . All inter- and intra-cross-links are reported in Table S2 .
Unless otherwise noted, all CX-MS data analyses were performed using Python v2.7. Plots were generated using Matplotlib v2.2.3 and the Seaborn v0.9.0 data visualization packages.
Somatic cancer mutation data from various protein transcripts in COSMIC v90 were obtained for BAF subunits: SMARCA4 (ENST00000344626), SMARCA2 (ENST00000382203), SMARCB1 (ENST00000644036), ARID1A (ENST00000324856), ARID1B (ENST00000350026), SMARCD1 (ENST00000394963), SMARCD2 (ENST00000448276), SMARCD3 (ENST00000262188), ACTL6A (ENST00000429709), ACTB (ENST00000331789), SMARCC1 (ENST00000254480), SMARCC2 (ENST00000267064), SMARCE1 (ENST00000348513), DPF1 (ENST00000420980), DPF2 (ENST00000528416), DPF3 (ENST00000556509), BCL7A (ENST00000261822), BCL7B (ENST00000223368), and BCL7C (ENST00000215115), and other chromatin remodeling complex subunits: INO80A (ENST00000361937), INO80B (ENST00000233331), RUVBL1 (ENST00000322623), RUVBL2 (ENST00000595090), ACTR5 (ENST00000243903), ACTR6 (ENST00000188312), SRCAP (ENST00000262518), ZNHIT1 (ENST00000305105), and CHD1 (ENST00000614616). These data were filtered for missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations (matching “Mutation Description” values of ‘Substitution - Missense’, ‘Substitution - Nonsense’, ‘Deletion - Frameshift’, ‘Insertion - Frameshift’, or ‘Frameshift’), and COSMIC complex mutations and known SNPs were excluded. This filtered set of somatic cancer mutations was mapped to the canonical FASTA sequences of the following UniProtKB entries: SMARCA4 (P51532), SMARCA2 (P51531), SMARCB1 (Q12824), ARID1A (O14497), ARID1B (Q8NFD5), SMARCD1 (Q96GM5), SMARCE1 (Q969G3), SMARCD2 (Q92925), SMARCD3 (Q6STE5), ACTL6A (O96019), ACTB (P60709), SMARCC1 (Q92922), SMARCC2 (Q8TAQ2), DPF1 (Q92782), DPF2 (Q92785), DPF3 (Q92784), INO80A (Q9ULG1), INO80B (Q9C086), RUVBL1 (Q9Y265), RUVBL2 (Q9Y230), ACTR5 (Q9H9F9), ACTR6 (Q9GZN1), SRCAP (Q6ZRS2), ZNHIT1 (O43257), and CHD1 (O14646).
Predicted and known functional domain annotations of the BAF and histone core proteins were obtained from PFAM and the InterPro databases and the literature.
The total number of cross-links between BAF subunits were represented as heatmaps, in which paralog subunits were considered equivalent, using the seaborn clustermap function with default parameters and no clustering.
For heatmaps showing the number of cross-links at the domain level, each BAF subunit or histone protein was divided into regions of variable residue lengths based on predicted and known functional domain annotations (see Table S2 ). Cross-links between protein regions were counted and paralog subunits were considered equivalent. The raw counts of cross-links were represented as heatmaps using the seaborn clustermap function with default parameters and no clustering. Additionally, somatic cancer missense mutations within five residues on either side of a unique cross-link (window = 11 aa) were summed and plotted on various scatterplots integrating cross-linking and missense mutation data using matplotlib. Unless otherwise noted, the missense mutation frequency was plotted on a logarithmic base-10 scale and both inter- and intra-cross-links were included in this CXMS-missense mutation scatterplot analysis.
For heatmaps showing changes in cross-links at the domain level between nucleosome-bound BAF and free BAF, the raw differences in the number of cross-links were plotted using the seaborn clustermap function with default parameters and no clustering.
The nucleosome-bound BAF structure was split into four modules: core (ARID1A/1B, SMARCB1, SMARCC1/2, SMARCD1/2/3, SMARCE1, and DPF2), ATPase (SMARCA2/4, BCL7A/B/C), ARP (ACTL6A/B, ACTB), and NCP (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The total number of unique somatic cancer mutations stratified by type (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) within five residues on either side of the total set of unique cross-links (window = 11 aa, centered at each unique CX-MS site) representing BAF subunit–subunit, BAF subunit–module, and BAF subunit–NCP interfaces were summed and plotted as bar plots. The number of missense mutations within five residues of a cross-link (window = 11 aa) were further summarized as a pie chart using matplotlib, in which the number of unique missense mutations within five residues of the total set of unique cross-links representing BAF core inter-subunit interfaces, BAF ATPase and ARP inter-subunit interfaces (excluding the SMARCA helicase N- and C-terminal domains), BAF ATPase and ARP catalytic interfaces (interfaces that include the SMARCA helicase N- and C-terminal domains), BAF subunit–NCP fold interfaces, or BAF subunit–NCP tail interfaces, were summed and used as input into the pie chart. These missense mutations affecting BAF subunit–NCP fold interfaces and BAF subunit–NCP tail interfaces were also represented as a bar chart using matplotlib.
Additionally, the total number of inter-cross-links by residue position across the various BAF subunits were visualized as dotplots and histograms using matplotlib. Ambiguous cross-links that could be mapped to multiple paralogs of human BAF were remapped to the following set of BAF subunits where possible: SMARCA4, BCL7A, SS18, ACTL6A, ACTB, DPF2, ARID1A, SMARCB1, SMARCC1, SMARCC2, SMARCD1, and SMARCE1. Paralogs were considered equivalent in this analysis in the labeling of the outbound ends of these remapped inter-cross-links for these visualizations.
The remapped inter-cross-links with ARID1A ARID/ARID-CBRA inter-region, SMARCC1 N-term, SMARCC2 N-term, BCL7A, SMARCB1 winged-helix, and SS18 on one end were visualized on the model using PyMOL. The resolved ends of these cross-links were visualized on the model as black circles. Histones and BAF subunits were colored using hues consistent with the inter-cross-link protein diagrams described above.
Pairwise alignments of the FASTA sequences of the protein chains from the models of endogenous human BAF complex, recombinant human BAF complex (PDB: 6LTJ ), yeast RSC complex (PDB: 6KW4 ), and yeast SWI/SNF complex (PDB: 6UXW ) and the corresponding canonical FASTA sequence of the UniProtKB entries described above were used to compute the sequence coverages of each model. EMBOSS Needle v6.6.0 with default parameters was used for pairwise alignments. Paralogs were excluded in this coverage analysis, so the canonical FASTA sequences of the following subunits of the endogenous human BAF complex were used: SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SMARCC1, SMARCC2, SMARCD1, SMARCE1, DPF2, ARID1A, BCL7A, SS18, ACTB, and ACTL6A. Chains J, V, Y of the yeast RSC complex (PDB: 6KW4 ) were concatenated by residue position, chain D was aligned to SMARCC1, and chain H was aligned to SMARCC1. Chains G and E of the yeast SWI/SF complex (PDB: 6UXW ) were concatenated by residue position and aligned to SMARCC1, and chains F and D were concatenated by residue position and aligned to SMARCC2. Chain O of the recombinant human BAF complex (PDB: 6LTJ ) was aligned to SMARCC1 and chain N was aligned to SMARCC2. Coverage maps along with domain annotations were plotted as ribbons using matplotlib.
Percentage of total coverage and coverage by BAF subunit were plotted as bar charts or grouped bar charts using matplotlib. The lengths of the individual BAF subunits were obtained from the lengths of the canonical FASTA sequences of the UniProtKB entries described above. In particular, the protein lengths for SMARCA4 (1647 aa), SMARCB1 (385 aa), SMARCC1 (1105 aa), SMARCC2 (1214 aa), SMARCD1 (515 aa), SMARCE1 (411 aa), DPF2 (391 aa), ARID1A (2285 aa), BCL7A (210 aa), SS18 (418 aa), ACTB (375 aa), and ACTL6A (429 aa) were used for a total BAF length of 9385 aa.
Unless otherwise noted, pairwise alignments were performed with EMBOSS Needle v6.6.0 with default parameters, and multiple sequence alignments were performed with Clustal Omega v1.2.4 with default parameters. Additionally, all alignments were performed using these software packages hosted on the EMBL-EBI portal. All mutations used were derived from the COSMIC mutation database ( https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic ).
The canonical FASTA sequences of the UniProtKB entries were aligned to the sequences in the final model of the endogenous human BAF complex and in the structures of the yeast RSC complex (PDB: 6KW3 , 6KW4 ), the yeast SWI/SNF complex (PDB: 6UXW ), and the recombinant human BAF complex (PDB: 6LTH , 6LTJ ) using EMBOSS Needle v6.6.0 with default parameters for pairwise sequence alignments (for BAF subunits without paralogs) and Clustal Omega v1.2.4 with default parameters for multiple sequence alignments (for BAF subunits with paralogs) to create a map between the canonical FASTA sequence and the structural sequence. Chain concatenations for broken chains, and chain assignments for SMARCC1/SMARCC2 were consistent with the chain concatenations and assignments described previously under Coverage. Unless otherwise noted, all known SNPs were excluded in the mutational modeling analysis.
Sequence alignments between the canonical FASTA sequences described previously and the FASTA sequences resolved in the structures of the complexes were used to map the filtered missense somatic cancer mutation data onto the models. Pairwise sequence alignments (for BAF subunits without paralogs) and multiple sequence alignments (for BAF subunits with paralogs) were performed using EMBOSS Needle v6.6.0 and Clustal Omega v1.2.4 with default parameters, respectively. Mutations across paralogs (e.g., ARID1A/1B) were summed. The missense mutational recurrence by residue position onto the sequences included in the models was visualized across the BAF complexes using PyMOL v2.3.4. The mutation frequency values were stored in the, initially blanked, B-factor columns of the raw pdb files using BioPandas v0.2.4. Unless otherwise noted, the mutation recurrence was binned into three groups: zero mutations (white), one mutation (pink), and two or more mutations (red) using the color_b add-on PyMOL script. Electrostatic potentials for the NCP were calculated using the ABPS plugin. Unless otherwise noted, all known SNPs were excluded in the mutational modeling analysis.
Additionally, sequence alignments between the canonical FASTA sequences and the FASTA sequences included in the structures of the INO80A complex (PDB: 6HTS ), the SWR1 complex (PDB: 6GEN ), and the Chd1 complex (PDB: 5O9G ) were used to map the filtered somatic cancer mutation data onto the sequences included in the models. Only pairwise sequence alignments were performed using EMBOSS Needle 6.6.0 because paralogs were excluded in this analysis. Nonsynonymous (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) mutation frequencies by residue positions were visualized across the models with the same color gradient described above. All known SNPs were included in this mutational modeling analysis, and paralogs were excluded in this analysis.
For the comparative analysis of missense mutation coverage in the models of the endogenous and recombinant human BAF complexes, differences in sequence coverages of the structures described under Coverage were used to identify missense mutations exclusive to the model of the endogenous human BAF complex, missense mutations exclusive to the model of the recombinant human BAF complex, and missense mutations shared by both models. The missense mutation frequencies of these three sets of mutations were plotted onto the models using a three-bin (0 mutations, 1 mutation, 2+ mutations) white-to-red (for mutations exclusive to one model) or white-to-blue (for mutations shared by both models) binned color gradient.
For the comparative analysis of missense mutational recurrence of the BAF and other chromatin-remodeling complexes, the INO80A (PDB: 6HTS ), SWR (PDB: 6GEN ), and Chd1 (PDB: 5O9G ) complexes, at subunit–NCP histone and subunit–NCP DNA interfaces, the total number of missense mutations occurring at residues with α-carbons within 10 Å of the α-carbons of the histone core (for the interfaces with NCP histones) or the total number of missense mutations occurring at residues with α-carbons within 10 Å of the DNA (for (for subunit—NCP histone interfaces) were identified using the PyMOL within function, and plotted as grouped bar charts using matplotlib. The missense mutations originating from subunit paralogs of all chromatin-remodeling complexes, including human BAF subunit paralogs (ACTL6B, BCL7B/C, ARID1B, DPF1/3, SMARCA2, SMARCD2/3), were excluded in this analysis.
Putative missense cancer driver mutations from a PanCancer analysis of TCGA data from Bailey et al. (2018) 3. Bailey, M.H. ∙ Tokheim, C. ∙ Porta-Pardo, E. ..., MC3 Working Group, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations Cell. 2018; 173 :371-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1273) PubMed Google Scholar , were mapped to the model of the endogenous human BAF complex using the appropriate sequence alignments described above. Additionally, the total percentages of putative missense drivers mappable on the models of the endogenous and recombinant human BAF complexes were plotted as a bar chart using matplotlib. Human BAF subunit paralogs with putative missense drivers (ARID1B and SMARCA2) were excluded in both analyses.
The model of the endogenous human BAF complex was compared to the structures of the yeast RSC complex (PDB: 6KW3 /4), the yeast SWI/SNF complex (PDB: 6UXW ), and the recombinant human BAF complex (PDB: 6LTH , 6LTJ ). Unless otherwise noted, the structures were aligned with the PyMOL align or cealign functions (whichever alignment produced a lower RMSD) using the histone core (H2A/B, H3, H4) as reference. The PyMOL get_angle function was used to compute the angles between the ATP-binding pockets and the PyMOL angle_between_helices function was used to compute the angle between the α helices of the structures (e.g., between the HSA of the yeast RSC or SWI/SNF complexes and the endogenous human BAF complex).
For the figure comparing the HSAs of the different complexes, the NCP in the yeast RSC complex structure was aligned to the NCP in the yeast SWI/SNF complex structure using the PyMOL align function, followed by alignments of of the endogenous and recombinant human BAF complex to the yeast RSC NCP structure using the PyMOL cealign function.
To determine the fraction of IDP regions, full-length human and yeast subunit protein sequences were subjected to “GlobPlot,” a predictor of globular domains ( Linding et al., 2003 24. Linding, R. ∙ Russell, R.B. ∙ Neduva, V. ... GlobPlot: Exploring protein sequences for globularity and disorder Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :3701-3708 Crossref Scopus (861) PubMed Google Scholar ). Search was restricted to components of the human and yeast complexes that were identifiable through sequence (for example SMARCE has no identifiable homolog in yeast and hence was not used in this calculation). These calculations take into account putative globular domains with no identifiable sequence similarity to any known domain. > AJT87389.1: Snf2p: SMARCA2/4 > AJV95515.1: Swi1p: ARID1A/B, (EDZ68798.1) > EDZ68798.1: YPL016Wp: ARID1A/B (AJV95515.1) > AJP83426.1: Snf5p: SMARCB1 > AJR69048.1: Swi3p: SMARCC1/2 > AJT27900.1: snf12p: SMARCD1/2/3
From this analysis, 55% of the human BAF complex is predicted to be globular, while 69% of the yeast complex is predicted to be globular (45% versus 31% IDP, respectively).
