Title: Replication stress impairs chromosome segregation and preimplantation development in human embryos


Abstract: Summary

Human cleavage-stage embryos frequently acquire chromosomal aneuploidies during mitosis due to unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that S phase at the 1-cell stage shows replication fork stalling, low fork speed, and DNA synthesis extending into G2 phase. DNA damage foci consistent with collapsed replication forks, DSBs, and incomplete replication form in G2 in an ATR- and MRE11-dependent manner, followed by spontaneous chromosome breakage and segmental aneuploidies. Entry into mitosis with incomplete replication results in chromosome breakage, whole and segmental chromosome errors, micronucleation, chromosome fragmentation, and poor embryo quality. Sites of spontaneous chromosome breakage are concordant with sites of DNA synthesis in G2 phase, locating to gene-poor regions with long neural genes, which are transcriptionally silent at this stage of development. Thus, DNA replication stress in mammalian preimplantation embryos predisposes gene-poor regions to fragility, and in particular in the human embryo, to the formation of aneuploidies, impairing developmental potential.

Section: Introduction

Human reproduction is remarkably inefficient, with abnormalities in the karyotype thought to be an important cause of developmental failure. Human embryos commonly acquire chromosomal abnormalities during mitosis ( Vanneste et al., 2009 97. Vanneste, E. ∙ Voet, T. ∙ Le Caignec, C. ... Chromosome instability is common in human cleavage-stage embryos Nat. Med. 2009; 15 :577-583 Crossref Scopus (619) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the mechanism of their formation is poorly understood. We have recently shown that a double-strand break (DSB) introduced by Cas9 results in both whole as well as segmental chromosomal aneuploidies ( Zuccaro et al., 2020 120. Zuccaro, M.V. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Mitchell, C. ... Allele-specific chromosome removal after Cas9 cleavage in human embryos Cell. 2020; 183 :1650-1664 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). DSBs observed as segmental chromosome aneuploidies may also arise spontaneously and contribute to aneuploidy ( Daphnis et al., 2008 24. Daphnis, D.D. ∙ Fragouli, E. ∙ Economou, K. ...

The incidence and origin of segmental aneuploidy in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos Hum. Reprod. 2017; 32 :2549-2560 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Arresting aneuploid human embryos generated through in vitro fertilization (IVF) upregulate the expression of growth-arrest- and DNA-damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) family genes ( Vera-Rodriguez et al., 2015 99. Vera-Rodriguez, M. ∙ Chavez, S.L. ∙ Rubio, C. ... Prediction model for aneuploidy in early human embryo development revealed by single-cell analysis Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7601 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which are induced in response to various forms of DNA damage and mediate cell-cycle arrest in G2 phase ( Wang et al., 1999 101. Wang, X.W. ∙ Zhan, Q. ∙ Coursen, J.D. ... GADD45 induction of a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :3706-3711 Crossref Scopus (533) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, spontaneous DNA damage in human embryos affects cell-cycle progression and contributes to embryo attrition. A large body of literature demonstrates a strong correlation between mitotic cell-cycle progression, ploidy, the quality of the blastocysts formed, and successful implantation ( Aguilar et al., 2014 1.

IVF clinics worldwide grade the quality of cleavage- and blastocyst-stage embryos based on morphological criteria reflecting cell-cycle progression. These criteria have prognostic value and guide decisions on whether or not to transfer embryos ( Richardson et al., 2015 80. Richardson, A. ∙ Brearley, S. ∙ Ahitan, S. ...

Racowsky, C. ∙ Vernon, M. ∙ Mayer, J. ... Standardization of grading embryo morphology Fertil. Steril. 2010; 94 :1152-1153 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, embryos with segmental aneuploidy are of lower quality than those without ( Escribà et al., 2019 30. Escribà, M.J. ∙ Vendrell, X. ∙ Peinado, V. Segmental aneuploidy in human blastocysts: a qualitative and quantitative overview Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2019; 17 :76 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, how spontaneous chromosomal breaks form and are repaired in the human embryo has not been investigated through controlled experimentation. Furthermore, the location of spontaneous breaks in the genome has not been mapped to genomic coordinates, which could provide insight into the mechanisms of their formation.

Section: Results

The first cell cycle in human progresses within a 1-day window from fertilization to mitosis. To distinguish DNA damage inherited from the gamete versus DNA damage acquired during cell-cycle progression, we stained zygotes on day 0, shortly after fertilization and pronucleus formation, as well as on day 1, shortly before the first mitosis ( Figure 1 A). No foci for γH2AX or RAD51 were seen at 1–2 h post pronuclear appearance, but both γH2AX foci and RAD51 foci were found on day 1 and shortly before mitosis in human zygotes ( Figures 1 B–1D). The phosphorylation of γH2AX at Ser139 can be mediated through the activation of ATR kinase, which is activated in response to DNA replication stress ( Ward and Chen, 2001 102. Ward, I.M. ∙ Chen, J. Histone H2AX is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner in response to replicational stress J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :47759-47762 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (925) PubMed Google Scholar ). When parthenogenetically activated oocytes were incubated in ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein) inhibitor from 14–18 h into the first cell cycle, the number of γH2AX foci was reduced significantly relative to controls evaluated at the same time point ( Figures 1 E–1G). Therefore, foci indicating DNA damage and repair form de novo after the first S phase. These foci may be DSBs at collapsed replication forks or ssDNA gaps that emerge at stalled replication forks or at lesions behind the fork ( Petermann et al., 2010 75. Petermann, E. ∙ Orta, M.L. ∙ Issaeva, N. ... Hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks become progressively inactivated and require two different RAD51-mediated pathways for restart and repair Mol.

PrimPol-dependent single-stranded gap formation mediates homologous recombination at bulky DNA adducts Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5863 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). MRE11 binds to DSBs at stalled forks and at ssDNA gaps to mediate resection, the formation of ssDNA tracts, and the loading of RPA and Rad51 to initiate repair ( Piberger et al., 2020 76. Piberger, A.L. ∙ Bowry, A. ∙ Kelly, R.D.W. ... PrimPol-dependent single-stranded gap formation mediates homologous recombination at bulky DNA adducts Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5863 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shibata et al., 2014 88. Shibata, A. ∙ Moiani, D. ∙ Arvai, A.S. ... DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice is directed by distinct MRE11 nuclease activities Mol. Cell. 2014; 53 :7-18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). We inhibited MRE11 endonuclease activity using PFM01 ( Shibata et al., 2014 88. Shibata, A. ∙ Moiani, D. ∙ Arvai, A.S. ... DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice is directed by distinct MRE11 nuclease activities Mol. Cell. 2014; 53 :7-18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the presence of PFM01, the formation of γH2AX and Rad51 foci was inhibited ( Figures 1 G and S1 A). Thus, γH2AX and Rad51 foci in G2 phase zygotes represent DNA breaks or gaps that undergo MRE11-dependent processing and activate ATR signaling.
We also stained cleavage stage and blastocyst stages human embryos ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Foci for γH2AX increased significantly at the cleavage stage ( Figure 1 C), whereas RAD51 foci remained constant ( Figure 1 D). Foci for RPA32, indicating extensive ssDNA ( Raderschall et al., 1999 79. Raderschall, E. ∙ Golub, E.I. ∙ Haaf, T. Nuclear foci of mammalian recombination proteins are located at single-stranded DNA regions formed after DNA damage Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :1921-1926 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ), were first observed at the cleavage stage and decreased at the blastocyst stage ( Figure 1 H). Consistent with ATR activation, RPA32 was found phosphorylated at serine S33 ( Figures S1 B–S1D), as well as at S4 and S8 ( Figures S1 E and S1F). RPA32 S33 phosphorylation is conferred by ATR ( Vassin et al., 2009 98. Vassin, V.M. ∙ Anantha, R.W. ∙ Sokolova, E. ... Human RPA phosphorylation by ATR stimulates DNA synthesis and prevents ssDNA accumulation during DNA-replication stress J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122 :4070-4080 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas S4 and S8 are phosphorylated at DSBs by DNA-PK or ATM in dependence on S33 phosphorylation ( Anantha et al., 2007 3. Anantha, R.W. ∙ Vassin, V.M. ∙ Borowiec, J.A. Sequential and synergistic modification of human RPA stimulates chromosomal DNA repair J. Biol.

DNA-PK-dependent RPA2 hyperphosphorylation facilitates DNA repair and suppresses sister chromatid exchange PLoS One. 2011; 6 :e21424 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phosphorylation of RPA32 S33 was found in embryos fertilized by either intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or by in vitro fertilization ( Figure S1 D) and was particularly notable in binucleated cells and in micronuclei ( Figure S1 B). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of CHK1 at serine 317, a checkpoint kinase phosphorylated by and acting downstream of ATR ( Liu et al., 2000 58. Liu, Q. ∙ Guntuku, S. ∙ Cui, X.S. ... Chk1 is an essential kinase that is regulated by Atr and required for the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint Genes Dev. 2000; 14 :1448-1459 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ), was also observed ( Figures S1 G–S1I).
53BP1 foci smaller than 1μm that mark DSBs ( Schultz et al., 2000 85. Schultz, L.B. ∙ Chehab, N.H. ∙ Malikzay, A. ... p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) is an early participant in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151 :1381-1390 Crossref Scopus (719) PubMed Google Scholar ) were absent on days 1 and 2 of development and increased significantly on day 3 ( Figures 1 I and S1 J–S1L). Interestingly, 53BP1 bodies larger than 1 μm in diameter ( Figure S1 L) were most common in blastocyst-stage embryos ( Figure S1 N), present in ∼20% of cells ( Figure S1 O). The 53BP1 bodies indicate sites of repair of incompletely replicated DNA from the previous S phase passed on to daughter cells ( Lukas et al., 2011 60. Lukas, C. ∙ Savic, V. ∙ Bekker-Jensen, S. ... 53BP1 nuclear bodies form around DNA lesions generated by mitotic transmission of chromosomes under replication stress Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13 :243-253 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ; Harrigan et al., 2011 39. Harrigan, J.A. ∙ Belotserkovskaya, R. ∙ Coates, J. ... Replication stress induces 53BP1-containing OPT domains in G1 cells J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193 :97-108 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is apparent in the symmetry of 53BP1 bodies ( Figure S1 M), and the presence of RPA32 marking ssDNA ( Figures 1 B, bottom right, and S1 M). The developmental timing of 53BP1 foci formation may be due to the absence of detectable RNF168 transcripts prior to embryonic genome activation (EGA) ( Figure S1 P); RNF168 is required for the formation of 53BP1 foci at DSBs ( Bohgaki et al., 2011 8.

RNF168 binds and amplifies ubiquitin conjugates on damaged chromosomes to allow accumulation of repair proteins Cell. 2009; 136 :435-446 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (689) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Abnormal nucleation, defined by the presence of multiple nuclei within a single blastomere, paralleled the formation of RPA32 foci; although no abnormal nucleation was observed at the zygote stage, it was most common on day 3 at the cleavage stage and decreased at the blastocyst stage ( Figure 1 J). Chromatin bridges, indicative of unresolved replication intermediates at mitosis, were also observed in cleavage-stage and blastocyst-stage embryos ( Figures S1 Q and S1R).
Thus, DNA damage is acquired de novo during the first cell cycle and at subsequent cleavage divisions. The formation of ssDNA, micronucleation, chromatin bridges, Rad51 foci, 53BP1 foci, and 53BP1 bodies and the phosphorylation of H2AX, RPA32, and CHK1 in preimplantation development are consistent with DNA replication stress, DSBs or a combination of breaks and ssDNA gaps, and with late or incomplete replication at entry into mitosis.
Spontaneous DNA damage can arise during S phase and thus we aimed to understand S-phase progression in human zygotes. We incubated human zygotes with EdU in hourly intervals after fertilization beginning after pronucleus formation ( Figure 2 A). Pronucleus (PN) formation occurred between 4 and 7.5 h post ICSI ( Figure S2 A). EdU staining was noted from 6 to 13 h post ICSI but not after 14 h or more ( Figure 2 A). Therefore, S phase is 6–7 h in human zygotes ( Figure 2 B). Mitotic entry occurred between 20 and 27 h post ICSI in 19 of 20 zygotes with an average of 24 h ( Figure 2 C). Human parthenotes (n = 22) were generated by an activation pulse. Pronuclei formed at 4 h post activation ( Figure S2 B), and all human parthenotes (15/15) were in mitosis by 22 h ( Figure 2 C). Thus, the longest phase of the cell cycle is G2, lasting 8–14 h ( Figure 2 B). DNA damage foci observed on day 1 in human zygotes are in G2 phase cells, suggesting a continued requirement for DNA synthesis and/or repair.
In addition to EdU staining, we determined the timing of DNA replication completion by applying aphidicolin and monitoring mitotic progression. Aphidicolin introduces replication fork stalling by reversibly inhibiting B-type family DNA polymerases ( Ikegami et al., 1978 43. Ikegami, S. ∙ Taguchi, T. ∙ Ohashi, M. ... Aphidicolin prevents mitotic cell division by interfering with the activity of DNA polymerase-alpha Nature. 1978; 275 :458-460 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Wright et al., 1994 109. Wright, G.E. ∙ Hübscher, U. ∙ Khan, N.N. ... Inhibitor analysis of calf thymus DNA polymerases alpha, delta and epsilon FEBS Lett. 1994; 341 :128-130 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oocytes were activated by parthenogenesis, which allows the synchronous progression through the first cell cycle. Incubation with aphidicolin at 14 h prevented mitotic entry, whereas incubation at 15.5 h allowed mitotic entry with a delay compared with controls ( Figure 2 C). Incubation with aphidicolin at 18 h had no effects on mitotic entry timing. In the presence of aphidicolin from 15.5 h post activation, foci for γH2AX and RPA32 formed within 6 h ( Figure 2 D). The ssDNA bound by RPA32 at remodeled forks activates an ATR-dependent checkpoint ( Zou and Elledge, 2003 118. Zou, L. ∙ Elledge, S.J. Sensing DNA damage through ATRIP recognition of RPA-ssDNA complexes Science. 2003; 300 :1542-1548 Crossref Scopus (2053) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the presence of an inhibitor of ATR kinase or of CHK1 kinase from 15.5 h post activation, zygotes entered mitosis with normal timing despite aphidicolin exposure ( Figure 2 C). Thus, DNA synthesis by replicative DNA polymerase continues at least until 15–16 h post activation, concordant with the presence of spontaneous DNA damage foci. Incompletely replicated DNA delays entry into mitosis in an ATR- and CHK1-dependent manner.
To determine whether CHK1 kinase controls the timing of mitotic entry, we used both ICSI as well as parthenogenetic activation and incubated 1-cell embryos in one of two different CHK1 inhibitors, starting at 15 h. CHK1 inhibition advanced mitotic entry by 4 h, from 24 to 20.3 h in fertilized zygotes and from 21.7 to 17.25 h in parthenotes to as early as 16 h ( Figure 2 E). CHK1 inhibition in G2 phase was detrimental to genome stability: 9/9 stained zygotes formed abnormal nuclei marked by γH2AX foci after mitotic exit and failed cytokinesis ( Figure 2 F). Although most control 2-cell embryos were euploid (12/16 blastomeres), CHK1 inhibition specifically in G2 phase resulted in a high degree of aneuploidy that was further amplified through the addition of aphidicolin ( Figure 2 G). And when CHK1 was inhibited in day-3 cleavage-stage embryos of 7–8 cells, no cavitation occurred (0/9 embryos), while 3/5 control embryos did undergo cavitation on day 6 of development (p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). CHK1 inhibition in cleavage-stage embryos also resulted in cells containing multiple micronuclei with γH2AX foci ( Figure S2 C).
To better understand the first S phase in mammalian zygotes, we also used mice. Murine DNA replication occurs between 4 and 10 h post fertilization ( Bui et al., 2010 12. Bui, H.T. ∙ Wakayama, S. ∙ Kishigami, S. ... Effect of trichostatin A on chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, DNA replication, and transcriptional activity in cloned mouse embryos Biol. Reprod. 2010; 83 :454-463 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with previous studies on fertilized zygotes, parthenogenetic embryos showed no detectable EdU staining between 10–12 h (n = 10) and 12–14 h (n = 10) post activation. Mitotic entry of controls occurred on average at 16 h, defining a G2 phase of ∼6 h ( Figure 2 H). As EdU staining of whole zygotes may not detect small segments of labeled DNA, we performed DNA fiber analysis of zygotes incubated in late G2 phase with IdU. IdU incorporation was seen in short segments that were estimated to be several hundred base pairs to ∼1 kb in length ( Figure 2 I). These could be termination events, repair of collapsed forks, or gap-filling events.
To evaluate DNA replication fork progression in S phase, we performed sequential labeling using IdU and CldU pulses in S phase. Mouse and human embryos showed very slow replication fork progression at the 1-cell stage, which doubled at the cleavage stage and at the blastocyst stage ( Figures 2 J–2L). Replication fork speed was increased through PARP inhibition in humans and mice ( Figures 2 M, 2N, S2 D, and S2E). PARP inhibition increases replication fork progression and reduces fork reversal under replication stress ( Zellweger et al., 2015 116. Zellweger, R. ∙ Dalcher, D. ∙ Mutreja, K. ... Rad51-mediated replication fork reversal is a global response to genotoxic treatments in human cells J. Cell Biol. 2015; 208 :563-579 Crossref Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maya-Mendoza et al., 2018 63. Maya-Mendoza, A. ∙ Moudry, P. ∙ Merchut-Maya, J.M. ... High speed of fork progression induces DNA replication stress and genomic instability Nature. 2018; 559 :279-284 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Frequent asymmetry was found in diverging sister forks, in particular at the zygote stage, indicating fork stalling ( Figures 2 O, 2P, and S2 F). Asymmetry in track length was common in zygotes, less common in 8-cell embryos, and uncommon in blastocyst embryos in mice ( Figure S2 G). PARP inhibition restored symmetry at the 1-cell stage in both mouse and human ( Figures S2 H, S2I, and S2J). These data are consistent with DNA replication stress.
As in humans, aphidicolin application in G2 phase of mouse 1-cell embryos inhibited mitotic entry depending on the time point of application ( Figure S2 L). G2 arrested zygotes formed foci with phosphorylated RPA32 on S33, S4, and S8 and foci for γH2AX and Rad51 ( Figure S3 ), which formed in an ATR-dependent manner within 2–4 h of fork stalling and resolving within 1–2 h after release from the compound ( Figure S3 ). Both G2 arrest and delay of mitotic entry were dependent on G2 checkpoint kinases CHK1 and ATR ( Figures 2 Q and S2 L). CHK1 inhibition in G2 phase also advanced mitotic entry of mouse 1-cell embryos relative to untreated controls from 16.1 to 15.7 h post activation ( Figure 2 R).
Notably, aphidicolin-treated human parthenotes reproduced defects recently described in human and bovine embryos associated with an abnormal first mitosis ( Cavazza et al., 2021 14. Cavazza, T. ∙ Takeda, Y. ∙ Politi, A.Z. ... Parental genome unification is highly error-prone in mammalian embryos Cell. 2021; 184 :2860-2877 e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), including a failure to polarize chromosomes in the nucleus (16/17 nuclei in this study) ( Figures 2 D and S2 M). Asynchrony in chromosome condensation and mitotic progression between two nuclei in two 2PN human zygotes was also observed ( Figures S2 N and S2O).
Unreplicated sites and DSBs can result in chromosome breakage upon entry into mitosis (reviewed in Mankouri et al. [2013] 62. Mankouri, H.W. ∙ Huttner, D. ∙ Hickson, I.D. How unfinished business from S-phase affects mitosis and beyond EMBO J. 2013; 32 :2661-2671 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chromosomal analysis provides a means to map sites of spontaneous chromosome breakage, which could provide insight into the location of DNA damage and the causes of aneuploidy.
We first analyzed germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes using single-cell genome sequencing. 11/11 GV oocytes showed normal chromosomal content without losses or gains of whole chromosomes or chromosomal arms ( Figures S4 A–S4C; Table S1 ). In contrast, embryos with Cas9-mediated DSBs showed segmental chromosomal changes at sites targeted by the gRNA ( Figures S4 D and S4E; Table S2 ), validating methods of analysis.
We analyzed eight 2-cell embryos and identified two segmental aneuploidies in 16 blastomeres ( Table S1 ). Thus, chromosome breakage is not the secondary consequence a prior abnormal mitosis and can occur spontaneously at the first cell division, consistent with the presence of unreplicated DNA and markers of DNA breakage in G2 zygotes. We then isolated blastomeres from 26 thawed day-3 cleavage-stage embryos ( Figure 3 A). 145 intact single cells were successfully thawed, collected, and sequenced of which 99 (68%) were aneuploid and 46 (32%) were euploid, and 5/26 embryos (28 cells, 19.5%) showed uniform chromosomal gains or losses, consistent with meiotic origin ( Figure 3 B; Table S1). 71 cells (49%) were aneuploid due to abnormalities acquired in mitosis characterized by different chromosome content in different cells of the same embryo, and 10 cells contained aneuploidies of both meiotic and mitotic origin ( Table S1 ). We identified a total of 301 chromosomal abnormalities due to mitotic segregation errors, consisting of 97 chromosomes with segmental aneuploidies (32%) with a copy-number change of a chromosome arm (1–2 copy-number transitions), 149 whole-chromosome gains and losses (50%), and 55 events (18%) with 3–10 copy-number transitions on the same chromosome, indicating fragmentation ( Figure 3 C; Table S1 ).
Mitotic aneuploidies in day-3 blastomeres showed a net loss of DNA—both segmental losses and whole-chromosome losses outnumbered gains ( Figure 3 D). This contrasts with chromosomal errors in meiosis, where the ratio of gains/losses approximates 1 throughout preimplantation development ( Franasiak et al., 2014 33. Franasiak, J.M. ∙ Forman, E.J. ∙ Hong, K.H. ... The nature of aneuploidy with increasing age of the female partner: a review of 15, 169 consecutive trophectoderm biopsies evaluated with comprehensive chromosomal screening Fertil. Steril. 2014; 101 :656-663.e1 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 D). Interestingly, for Cas9-induced chromosome segregation errors, the number of losses also exceeded gains in two different studies ( Figure 3 D).
To determine the location of spontaneous chromosomal breaks, we identified regions of copy-number transition. A 2-fold drop or a 50% increase in read number across a chromosomal arm identified the location of a segmental break. We identified a total of 117 chromosomal breaks in blastomeres of day-3 embryos ( Table S3 ). Of these, 57 mapped to intergenic areas, 23 mapped to centromeric and pericentromeric regions, and 37 mapped to gene bodies ( Figure 3 E). Concordant with the coordinates of chromosomal breaks in day-3 embryos, γH2AX foci marking DNA breaks were found at centromeres, while the majority located to chromosomal arms ( Figure 3 F). Gene density at break points was on average 1.5 genes/Mb, lower than at 50 randomly selected sites ( Figure 3 G; p < 0.0001). Only 5 sites had a gene density at genome average (6 genes/Mb) or higher, of which two were gene clusters ( Table S3 ).
Cleavage-stage embryo #4 is representative of the pattern of breakage: segmental breaks were observed in all (9/9) blastomeres, with reciprocal and mirroring copy-number transitions ( Figure 3 H). Reciprocal events arise from asymmetric chromosome segregation at mitosis, leading to loss and gain in daughter cells (e.g., FRA6I in Figure 3 I). Mirroring changes arise from cell-cycle progression of a cell, with aneuploidy acquired in a prior mitosis (e.g., at SPOCK1 in Figure 3 I). The division of human blastomeres with broken chromosomes is also seen after Cas9-induced breaks ( Figure S4 E). Each of the mirroring or reciprocal breaks located to gene-poor regions and common fragile sites ( Figure 3 I). Segmental losses occurred on chromosome 1 at FRA1S containing the RYR2 gene, at chromosome 3p14.3 containing the ERC2 gene, at FRA5C on chromosome 5 within the SPOCK1 gene, at FRA6I on chromosome 6 near the centromere, and at FRA11O on chromosome 11 within the CNTN5 gene. On the X chromosome, a break at the centromere appears to have preceded the fragmentation of the whole chromosome. Interestingly, transcripts encoded by genes located at these break points were all very long, with SPOCK1 spanning 524 kb, RYR2 792 kb, and ERC2 960 kb and CNTN5 spanning 1,289 kb. No whole-chromosome aneuploidies were observed in this embryo, and thus, chromosome breakage was not the secondary consequence of aneuploidy.
The sequencing-based analysis of intact cells provides incomplete resolution, as it is an aggregate signal of different nuclei within the same cell. To circumvent this limitation, we determined the chromosomal content of individually isolated micronuclei. We sequenced 12 individual micronuclei from day-3 blastomeres as well as 18 micronuclei from spontaneously arrested day 5 multicell embryos ( Figures 4 A and 4B). All micronuclei were aneuploid (n = 30) ( Figure 4 C), including both segmental, whole-chromosome errors, and fragmented chromosomes ( Figure 4 D). Isolated micronuclei typically were nullisomic for most chromosomes and contained as little as a single chromosome segment ( Figure 4 E). Break-point mapping in micronuclei isolated from day-3 embryos showed that all (n = 16) mapped to gene-poor areas (average 1.1 genes/Mb; Table S3 ), with gene density lower than random ( Figure 4 F). 12 break points mapped to chromosomal arms, while 4 (25%) mapped to centromeric and pericentromeric regions. In micronuclei isolated from arrested multicell day 5 embryos, 251 break points were mapped ( Table S3 ). Although gene density at break-point sites was below genome average and random simulated breakage ( Figure 4 F), there was an increase in gene-rich sites ( Figure 4 F). This increase may be due to the instability of chromosomes in micronuclei ( Crasta et al., 2012 22. Crasta, K. ∙ Ganem, N.J. ∙ Dagher, R. ... DNA breaks and chromosome pulverization from errors in mitosis Nature. 2012; 482 :53-58 Crossref Scopus (831) PubMed Google Scholar ), resulting in secondary break points.
Including all break sites identified in day-3 blastomeres, in micronuclei from day-3, and arrested day 5 embryos, we mapped a combined 466 break sites of which 371 were independent events ( Table S3 ). 154 (42%) were recurrent, locating to 55 different genomic locations ( Table S3 ). Recurrence was defined as a breakage in the same genomic region in different embryos. For instance, independent breaks were observed in blastomeres (2 independent breaks) and in micronuclei (2 independent breaks) at the CNTN5 locus and its neighboring intergenic region ( Figure 5 A). 22 fragile regions were defined by three or more independent recurrences of which 9 (consisting of 40 independent events) mapped to centromeres and pericentromeric regions, whereas 13 (consisting of 48 independent events Table S3 ) mapped to chromosomal arms.
Fragile regions with recurrent breaks harbored either a long transcript or overlapped a large intergenic area ( Figure 5 B). 18 of 22 mapped to aphidicolin-sensitive fragile sites identified in somatic cells ( Mrasek et al., 2010 66. Mrasek, K. ∙ Schoder, C. ∙ Teichmann, A.C. ... Global screening and extended nomenclature for 230 aphidicolin-inducible fragile sites, including 61 yet unreported ones Int. J. Oncol. 2010; 36 :929-940 PubMed Google Scholar ; Table S3 ). Chromosome fragility in somatic cells is associated with the expression of long genes in late replicating regions of the genome ( Wei et al., 2016 103. Wei, P.C. ∙ Chang, A.N. ∙ Kao, J. ... Long neural genes harbor recurrent DNA break clusters in neural stem/progenitor cells Cell. 2016; 164 :644-655 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ), potentially because of conflicts between transcription and replication ( Helmrich et al., 2011 40. Helmrich, A. ∙ Ballarino, M. ∙ Tora, L. Collisions between replication and transcription complexes cause common fragile site instability at the longest human genes Mol. Cell. 2011; 44 :966-977 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ; Brison et al., 2019 11. Brison, O. ∙ El-Hilali, S. ∙ Azar, D. ...

Commun. 2019; 10 :5693 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hamperl et al., 2017 38. Hamperl, S. ∙ Bocek, M.J. ∙ Saldivar, J.C. ... Transcription-replication conflict orientation modulates R-loop levels and activates distinct DNA damage responses Cell. 2017; 170 :774-786 e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We determined the expression of long transcripts at the location of recurrent chromosome breaks using published gene expression datasets ( Yan et al., 2013 113. Yan, L. ∙ Yang, M. ∙ Guo, H. ... Single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of human preimplantation embryos and embryonic stem cells Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :1131-1139 Crossref Scopus (1055) PubMed Google Scholar ). Long fragile site transcripts showed low levels in oocytes and were nearly undetectable at the cleavage stage ( Figure 5 C; Table S4 ). Likewise, only 3/37 transcripts of any length that harbored a break site in day-3 cleavage-stage embryos showed upregulation from the 1-cell stage to the cleavage stage ( Table S4 ). Among those 3 transcripts are RAPGEF2 (92-kb transcript), SP3 (57-kb transcript), and NBPF10, which has annotated transcript isoforms of 10 or 1,174 kb. Thus, the expression of neither long nor short transcripts correlates with chromosome fragility in the cleavage-stage embryo.
To directly determine if transcription contributes to embryonic DNA damage and abnormal chromosome segregation in preimplantation embryos, we incubated 2PN zygotes from days 1 to 3 in the presence of α-amanitin (n = 6), an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, or triptolide, an inhibitor of both RNA polymerase I and II (n = 5). Cell-cycle progression of human embryos until the 4–8-cell stage does not require transcription, which is inhibited by α-amanitin ( Braude et al., 1988 10. Braude, P. ∙ Bolton, V. ∙ Moore, S. Human gene expression first occurs between the four- and eight-cell stages of preimplantation development Nature. 1988; 332 :459-461 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Egli et al., 2011 28. Egli, D. ∙ Chen, A.E. ∙ Saphier, G. ... Reprogramming within hours following nuclear transfer into mouse but not human zygotes Nat. Commun. 2011; 2 :488 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). None of the embryos incubated with triptolide (0/4) showed ethynyl uridine label incorporation, whereas controls did, confirming transcriptional inhibition ( Figure 5 D). Moreover, no mouse embryos (0/15) developed beyond the two-cell stage in the presence of triptolide, indicating the effective inhibition of EGA, which occurs at the 2-cell stage in mice. Independent of the transcriptional inhibitor, micronucleation, which reflects mitotically acquired aneuploidies, remained comparable with untreated cleavage-stage embryos ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Furthermore, blastomeres contained foci for both γH2AX, RAD51, and RPA32 ( Figure 5 G). The presence of RPA32 foci in mitosis directly demonstrates cell-cycle progression with incompletely replicated single-stranded DNA ( Figure 5 H).
To determine the location of chromosome breakage prior to EGA, we analyzed the chromosome content of 8 embryos on day 1 of development at the 2-cell stage and 19 embryos on day 2 of development, 17 of which were at the 4-cell stage ( Table S3 ). 2 segmental errors were found in 2-cell embryos within a day of fertilization, and 8 independent segmental errors were found in 67 blastomeres of day-2 embryos. 8 of these were in gene-poor regions, whereas 2 were gene-rich, including the HOXA gene cluster on chromosome 7 and the olfactory receptor gene cluster pericentromeric on chromosome 11. Furthermore, 11 mirroring chromosomal changes in the same day-3 embryo arise through sequential divisions of an error that arose prior to EGA. Gene density at a total of 21 break sites occurring prior to EGA was lower than at simulated random sites ( Figure 5 I), and the pattern of fragility prior to EGA was the same as at EGA in day-3 embryos. Aneuploidy due to abnormal mitosis was observed in products of all three cleavage divisions on days 1–3 of development, including before EGA ( Figure 5 J).
In somatic cells, gene-poor regions are prone to fragility due to late replication in the cell cycle and entry into mitosis with unreplicated DNA ( Le Beau et al., 1998 53. Le Beau, M.M. ∙ Rassool, F.V. ∙ Neilly, M.E. ... Replication of a common fragile site, FRA3B, occurs late in S phase and is delayed further upon induction: implications for the mechanism of fragile site induction Hum. Mol. Genetics. 1998; 7 :755-761 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, 16/25 long fragile site transcripts greater than 500 kb show mitotic DNA synthesis in somatic cell lines ( Macheret et al., 2020 61. Macheret, M. ∙ Bhowmick, R. ∙ Sobkowiak, K. ... High-resolution mapping of mitotic DNA synthesis regions and common fragile sites in the human genome through direct sequencing Cell Res. 2020; 30 :997-1008 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ji et al., 2020 46. Ji, F. ∙ Liao, H. ∙ Pan, S. ... Genome-wide high-resolution mapping of mitotic DNA synthesis sites and common fragile sites by direct sequencing Cell Res. 2020; 30 :1009-1023 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ) (starred genes in Figure 5 C), suggesting that the timing of DNA replication completion may contribute to chromosome fragility of the human embryo.
To map sites of late replication completion in human zygotes, we incubated 6 parthenogenetically activated human embryos with aphidicolin and G2 checkpoint kinase inhibitor at 15.5 h into the first cell cycle ( Figure 6 A), uniformly resulting in the formation of multinucleate cells ( Figure 6 B). Individual micronuclei (n = 25) were isolated, and 21 from 4 zygotes were successfully sequenced. All contained incomplete genomes ( Figure 6 C and S5 A). The most common aneuploidy was whole-chromosome losses (248 chromosomes, 73%), followed by chromosomes with one or more segmental copy-number transitions (93 chromosomes, 27%) ( Figure 6 D).
The break-point analysis identified a total of 331 break sites ( Table S5 ). The analysis of polar bodies of the same embryos was performed to exclude a single break of meiotic origin. Of the 330 mitotic break sites, 191 (58%) showed reciprocity in a different nucleus, whereas 139 were singular, consistent with a recovery of chromosomal material per embryo of 59% ( Figure S5 B; Table S5 ). Per embryo, an average of 51 independent break points were found, corresponding to at least 51 unreplicated sites. 19 break sites (6%) were centromeric, and 189 break sites were intergenic of which 151 (46%) were located in intergenic areas of 0.5 Mb or greater. 122 break sites (37%) located within a transcript of which 71 (21.5%) were longer than 300 kb ( Figure 6 E). Among the longest genes were PARK2, CNTN5, PTPRD, CSMD1, MDGA2, PCDH9, and PCDH15 ( Figure 6 F). 184 breaks (56%) were in gene-poor areas of 1 or fewer genes/Mb, and 24 sites (7%) had a gene density at and above the genome average (∼6.9 genes/Mb). Of these 24 gene-rich sites, 16 (5%) located to gene clusters, in particular to olfactory receptor gene clusters (11) ( Figure S5 C), metalloproteinase gene clusters MMP (1) and ADAM (1), as well as CYP4 (1) and DEFB (2) gene clusters ( Figure 6 F). The remaining gene-rich areas had adjacent gene-poor regions of more than 0.5 Mb (e.g., SLC30A7 at 1p21.1; Figure S5 D). Only one site on chromosome 9q31.3 was not within or immediately adjacent to a gene-poor region. When comparing induced break sites with random simulated breakage, gene density was lower (p = 1.5e−7) ( Figure 6 G). Gene density at aphidicolin-induced break sites and spontaneous breakage in day-3 cleavage-stage embryos were not different ( Figure 6 G).
Break sites induced by aphidicolin at sites of G2 replication were concordant with spontaneous break sites, such as at CNTN5 on chromosome 11 or RALYL on chromosome 8 ( Figures 5 A and 6 H ). Of the 22 fragile regions in untreated embryos, 14 (64%) were also found in the cohort of aphidicolin-induced breaks ( Table S3 ). To evaluate concordance with fertilized embryos, we also incubated 4 2PN zygotes with aphidicolin and CHK1 inhibitor at 18 h post fertilization by ICSI. 7 chromosomal breaks were identified in 4 different genomic locations of which 2 were concordant with break points in parthenogenetically activated oocytes at the centromere on chromosome 9 and at RALYL on chromosome 8 ( Figure 6 H). Taken together, DNA synthesis continues at least until 18 h of the first cell cycle and into mitotic prophase. Notably, aphidicolin exposure at 18 h did not delay mitotic progression ( Figure 2 C), despite the presence of at least 2 unreplicated sites per embryo.
To evaluate the potential role of transcription in aphidicolin-sensitive replication delays, we examined the expression of transcripts at break sites ( Yan et al., 2013 113. Yan, L. ∙ Yang, M. ∙ Guo, H. ... Single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of human preimplantation embryos and embryonic stem cells Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :1131-1139 Crossref Scopus (1055) PubMed Google Scholar ). All but four of 93 transcription units with break sites, EIF3E, UVRAG, GULP1, and CRADD, were either not expressed or transcript levels decreased from the 1-cell stage to the morula stage after EGA ( Table S4 ). Only 3 of 330 break sites (0.9%) located near a transcription start site, and only one of these, CRADD, was expressed at a later developmental stage. Furthermore, we compared embryo break sites with transcription-dependent replication delays described in somatic cells ( Sarni et al., 2020 83. Sarni, D. ∙ Sasaki, T. ∙ Irony Tur-Sinai, M. ... 3D genome organization contributes to genome instability at fragile sites Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3613 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of the 119 sites identified by Sarni and colleagues, 6 sites were shared at the genes FTO, LAMA2, MAGI2, SCAPER, THSD4, and VPS13B. However, zygotes are transcriptionally largely silent, and none of these genes showed appreciable transcription after EGA ( Table S4 ). We also compared embryo break sites to aphidicolin-induced recurrent break sites in actively transcribed genes of human neuronal progenitors ( Wang et al., 2020 100. Wang, M. ∙ Wei, P.C. ∙ Lim, C.K. ... Increased neural progenitor proliferation in a hiPSC model of autism induces replication stress-associated genome instability Cell Stem Cell. 2020; 26 :221-233 e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of 31 sites identified by Wang and colleagues, 10 were shared with the embryo (32%) at CTNNA2, NRG3, RBFOX1, LRP1B, PARK2, MAGI2, LINGO2, DLG2, PCHD15, and LRRD4C. Eight of these ten genes show mitotic DNA synthesis in somatic cells ( Ji et al., 2020 46. Ji, F. ∙ Liao, H. ∙ Pan, S. ... Genome-wide high-resolution mapping of mitotic DNA synthesis sites and common fragile sites by direct sequencing Cell Res. 2020; 30 :1009-1023 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Macheret et al., 2020 61. Macheret, M. ∙ Bhowmick, R. ∙ Sobkowiak, K. ... High-resolution mapping of mitotic DNA synthesis regions and common fragile sites in the human genome through direct sequencing Cell Res. 2020; 30 :997-1008 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Again, these genes showed no expression during cleavage development. Thus, the need for DNA synthesis in G2 phase in human zygotes is independent of transcription-replication conflicts.
In mice, spontaneous mitotic chromosome segregation errors are less common than in human embryos ( Bolton et al., 2016 9. Bolton, H. ∙ Graham, S.J.L. ∙ Van Der Aa, N. ... Mouse model of chromosome mosaicism reveals lineage-specific depletion of aneuploid cells and normal developmental potential Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11165 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and preimplantation development is more efficient. Because of the low frequency of spontaneous segregation errors, the mouse lends itself to experimental interference. To determine whether inhibiting G2 replication reproduces the chromosomal and developmental abnormalities seen in human embryos, we applied the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin in G2 phase ( Figure 7 A). All 191/191 control parthenogenetic zygotes showed normal chromosome segregation at the first mitosis, whereas 17/99 (17.4%, range per experiment 7%–30%) treated embryos showed abnormal anaphase with lagging chromosomes and chromosome fragments ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Aphidicolin applied only after pronuclear envelope breakdown was inconsequential ( Figure 7 C). The frequency of abnormal anaphase figures increased to 63% (16/27) when embryos were exposed to both ATR kinase inhibitor and aphidicolin in G2 phase.
Chromosome content analysis of sister blastomeres at the 2-cell stage showed that 98% of control cells had normal mitotic segregation (57/58), whereas 33% (14/45) of aphidicolin-treated blastomeres showed aneuploidy ( Figure 7 D; Table S6 ). The combination of aphidicolin and G2 checkpoint inhibition further increased aneuploidy to 64.5% of the blastomeres (69/107), consistent with the frequency of abnormal anaphases. In aphidicolin-treated samples, a total of 28 chromosomal abnormalities were found in 45 blastomeres, or 0.62 per cell. G2 checkpoint inhibition alone resulted in 0.3 abnormalities per cell (8 aneuploidies in 27 cells). In embryos treated with both aphidicolin and G2 checkpoint inhibitor, aneuploidies increased to 2.1 per cell (226 aneuploidies in 107 cells) ( Figure 7 E). Karyotype abnormalities included whole-chromosome segregation errors (54%), segmental errors (37%), and chromosome fragmentation (9%) ( Figure 7 F). Whole chromosome as well as segmental losses exceeded gains by a ratio of ∼1:2 ( Figure 7 G).
Although in controls, 92% of eggs developed to the blastocyst stage, of the cleaved embryos exposed to aphidicolin in G2 phase, 72% developed to the blastocyst stage (range 25%–87%) ( Figure 7 H), concordant with the frequency of euploid embryos. On day 5 of development, blastocysts obtained after treatment with aphidicolin in G2 showed reduced total cell number and fewer ICM cells marked by Pou5f1, indicating low embryo quality ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Aphidicolin-treated embryos showed increased markers of DNA damage, including γH2AX, Rpa32, and Rpa32 phosphoS33 at the 4–8 cell stage at 48 h post activation ( Figures 7 K and 7L). Embryos were developmentally delayed and showed excluded blastomeres, binucleation, and increased micronucleation ( Figures 7 M and 7N). Thus, incomplete replication at the first mitosis destabilizes the genome in subsequent cell divisions and phenocopies common spontaneous defects in human embryos.
In comparison to human cleavage-stage embryos, untreated mouse embryos showed not only a lower frequency of spontaneous chromosome segregation errors ( Figure 7 E versus Figure 5 J) but also a lower frequency of segregation errors caused by interference with replication completion in G2 phase ( Figure 7 D versus Figure 6 C). Surprisingly, 38 of 107 (35.5%) of mouse 2-cell embryos were euploid despite combined aphidicolin exposure and G2 checkpoint inhibition ( Table S6 ), whereas all human embryos were aneuploid. Mouse embryos showed aneuploidies on just 2 chromosomes per cell, whereas human embryos showed catastrophic aneuploidy with on average 51 break sites or more than one genomic alteration per chromosome. This difference could be due to a lower number of unreplicated sites in mice at the time of inhibitor application or due to differences in the response and resolution of unreplicated DNA.
To estimate the number of unreplicated sites, we counted the number of DNA damage foci induced in G2 phase ( Figures S6 A–S6G). Aphidicolin incubation resulted in a higher number of γH2AX and RPA32 foci in mice (mean γH2AX foci 43, range 0–228, in mice versus human, mean 21, range 0–51). Approximately 10% of γH2AX foci were positive for RPA32 in both species, which averaged 1.8 in human versus 4.5 in mice per haploid nucleus ( Figures S6 B and S6D). The processing of DSBs and the extension of ssDNA gaps required for the formation of RPA binding and ATR kinase activation involves the nuclease activities of MRE11. The inhibition of MRE11 exonuclease using mirin results in a repair defect at DSBs and thereby increases the number of DNA damage foci ( Dupré et al., 2008 27. Dupré, A. ∙ Boyer-Chatenet, L. ∙ Sattler, R.M. ... A forward chemical genetic screen reveals an inhibitor of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4 :119-125 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shibata et al., 2014 88. Shibata, A. ∙ Moiani, D. ∙ Arvai, A.S. ... DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice is directed by distinct MRE11 nuclease activities Mol. Cell. 2014; 53 :7-18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). The addition of mirin combined with aphidicolin (schematic in Figure S6 A) increased the number of foci marked by γH2Ax in mouse zygotes to more than 100 and the number of Rad51 foci to more than 50 ( Figure S6 E). The inhibition of MRE11 endonuclease activity abrogated foci for both markers ( Figure S6 E), suggesting that sites stalled by aphidicolin were processed in an MRE11-dependent manner. An increase in the number of RAD51 foci upon combined exposure to aphidicolin and mirin was also seen in human zygotes, increasing to 50 sites on average ( Figure S6 F). The number of γH2Ax foci was not increased by MRE11 inhibition beyond aphidicolin incubation alone, though it could be an underestimate as large H2Ax bodies may contain multiple sites ( Figure S6 G). Thus, the number of foci marking unreplicated sites in G2 phase is higher in mice than in human at the relevant time points. The number of aneuploidies induced by aphidicolin incubation exceeds the number of γH2Ax foci in human, whereas in mice it is the reverse. Thus, human zygotes are less efficient at forming DNA damage foci and more efficient at converting sites of incomplete replication to chromosomal breaks and aneuploidy.
Consistent with differences in the processing of stalled replication forks, transcripts of SMARCAL1, FBH1, RAD51, and Bloom (BLM) were lower in human than in mice, whereas FANCJ/BACH1 was expressed at higher levels ( Figure S6 H; Table S7 ). These factors are involved at different steps of replication fork reversion and resection (reviewed in Joseph et al. [2020] 47. Joseph, S.A. ∙ Taglialatela, A. ∙ Leuzzi, G. ... Time for remodeling: SNF2-family DNA translocases in replication fork metabolism and human disease DNA Repair (Amst). 2020; 95 :102943 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 I). In contrast, transcripts for MUS81, which cleaves replication intermediates at prophase of mitosis to form DSBs, were higher in human ( Figure S6 H). Interestingly, human zygotes progressed to mitotic prophase (16 of 17) with condensed chromatids despite persistent γH2AX and RPA32 foci ( Figures 2 D and S2 M), whereas mouse zygotes arrested in G2 phase without chromosome condensation ( Figure S3 ). Human cleavage embryos were reported to express low levels of WEE1 kinase ( Kiessling et al., 2010 49. Kiessling, A.A. ∙ Bletsa, R. ∙ Desmarais, B. ... Genome-wide microarray evidence that 8-cell human blastomeres over-express cell cycle drivers and under-express checkpoints J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. 2010; 27 :265-276 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), which acts upstream of CDK1 and MUS81 to inhibit cleavage of replication forks that remain stalled late in the cell cycle ( Duda et al., 2016 26. Duda, H. ∙ Arter, M. ∙ Gloggnitzer, J. ... A mechanism for controlled breakage of under-replicated chromosomes during mitosis Dev. Cell. 2016; 39 :740-755 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed low WEE1 transcript levels at the 1-cell stage in human relative to mice ( Figure S7 A). When Wee1 kinase inhibitor was added alongside aphidicolin to mouse embryos, mitosis resulted in a highly fragmented genome ( Figures S7 B and S7C; Table S6 ), reproducing the frequent segmental breakages seen in human embryos. Wee1 kinase inhibition in G2 phase mouse embryos advanced mitosis by 1.5 h and impaired developmental potential compared with untreated controls ( Figures S7 D–S7F). In summary, inefficient DNA damage foci formation, progression to mitotic prophase with unreplicated DNA, and frequent formation of chromosomal breaks at sites of incomplete replication, followed by an unstable genome during cleavage divisions ( Figure S7 G) are defining differences between human and mouse preimplantation development.

Section: Discussion

Aneuploidy is a major cause of developmental failure in humans, but the origins of mitotic aneuploidies are not well understood. We show here that human embryos acquire DNA damage during embryonic DNA replication, which is characterized by replication fork stalling, DNA synthesis in G2 phase, followed by incomplete replication at mitosis, chromosome breakage, micronucleation, and aneuploidy. A possible cause of replication fork stalling is DNA demethylation, which occurs primarily during the first two cleavage divisions prior to zygotic genome activation ( Guo et al., 2014 37. Guo, H. ∙ Zhu, P. ∙ Yan, L. ... The DNA methylation landscape of human early embryos Nature. 2014; 511 :606-610 Crossref Scopus (618) PubMed Google Scholar ). Foci for γH2AX indeed form concordant with active DNA demethylation in mouse preimplantation embryos ( Wossidlo et al., 2010 108. Wossidlo, M. ∙ Arand, J. ∙ Sebastiano, V. ... Dynamic link of DNA demethylation, DNA strand breaks and repair in mouse zygotes EMBO J. 2010; 29 :1877-1888 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). Demethylation may affect DNA replication through the formation of abasic sites and ssDNA breaks that stall replication forks (reviewed in Thompson and Cortez [2020] 93. Thompson, P.S. ∙ Cortez, D. New insights into abasic site repair and tolerance DNA Repair. 2020; 90 :102866 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The replication of damaged DNA results in reduced replication fork speed ( Tercero and Diffley, 2001 92. Tercero, J.A. ∙ Diffley, J.F.X. Regulation of DNA replication fork progression through damaged DNA by the Mec1/Rad53 checkpoint Nature. 2001; 412 :553-557 Crossref Scopus (558) PubMed Google Scholar ), including stalling and fork reversal ( Iyer and Rhind, 2017 44. Iyer, D.R. ∙ Rhind, N. Replication fork slowing and stalling are distinct, checkpoint-independent consequences of replicating damaged DNA PLoS Genet. 2017; 13 :e1006958 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zellweger et al., 2015 116.

Cell Biol. 2015; 208 :563-579 Crossref Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ). The transcriptional silence of the early embryo during genome demethylation might be a necessary adaptation to avoid additional stress imposed by transcription-replication conflicts. Other potential sources of DNA replication stress are paternal DNA damage ( Simon et al., 2011 90. Simon, L. ∙ Lutton, D. ∙ Mcmanus, J. ... Sperm DNA damage measured by the alkaline Comet assay as an independent predictor of male infertility and in vitro fertilization success Fertil. Steril. 2011; 95 :652-657 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a short G1 phase ( Ahuja et al., 2016 2. Ahuja, A.K. ∙ Jodkowska, K. ∙ Teloni, F. ... A short G1 phase imposes constitutive replication stress and fork remodelling in mouse embryonic stem cells Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10660 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Paternal and maternal segmental aneuploidies are found in approximately equal frequency ( Zuccaro et al., 2020 120. Zuccaro, M.V. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Mitchell, C. ... Allele-specific chromosome removal after Cas9 cleavage in human embryos Cell. 2020; 183 :1650-1664 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), and slow replication fork speed and G2 replication are also seen in maternal-only embryos, arguing against paternal DNA damage as the primary source of DNA replication stress.
The mapping of spontaneous chromosomal break sites in the human embryo showed that these are typically gene poor, contain a long neural gene, or contain clusters of genes that are transcriptionally silent, such as olfactory receptor genes. These regions require DNA synthesis in G2 phase in the embryo. Gene-poor, fragile regions tend to complete replication late in the cell cycle also in somatic cells ( Macheret et al., 2020 61.

USA. 1998; 95 :11246-11250 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) and can remain incompletely replicated through mitosis ( Moreno et al., 2016 65. Moreno, A. ∙ Carrington, J.T. ∙ Albergante, L. ... Unreplicated DNA remaining from unperturbed S phases passes through mitosis for resolution in daughter cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E5757-E5764 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene-poor regions may be prone to fragility because of a limiting number of replication origins, as described for somatic cells ( Letessier et al., 2011 55. Letessier, A. ∙ Millot, G.A. ∙ Koundrioukoff, S. ... Cell-type-specific replication initiation programs set fragility of the FRA3B fragile site Nature. 2011; 470 :120-123 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies on the origin location in embryos will provide answers to this question.
Incomplete replication is known to affect chromosome segregation, chromosome condensation, and spindle function in somatic cells ( Burrell et al., 2013 13. Burrell, R.A. ∙ Mcclelland, S.E. ∙ Endesfelder, D. ...

Chromosomes with delayed replication timing lead to checkpoint activation, delayed recruitment of Aurora B and chromosome instability Oncogene. 2007; 26 :1852-1861 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, a recent study on human and bovine zygotes describes incomplete chromosome condensation, incomplete polarization of chromatin in the nucleus, and lagging chromosomes at the first cell division ( Cavazza et al., 2021 14. Cavazza, T. ∙ Takeda, Y. ∙ Politi, A.Z. ... Parental genome unification is highly error-prone in mammalian embryos Cell. 2021; 184 :2860-2877 e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). These defects can be conferred by incomplete replication as induced by aphidicolin. Though mitotic abnormalities can also be induced by interference with spindle function by nocodazole ( Bolton et al., 2016 9. Bolton, H. ∙ Graham, S.J.L. ∙ Van Der Aa, N. ... Mouse model of chromosome mosaicism reveals lineage-specific depletion of aneuploid cells and normal developmental potential Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11165 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Cavazza et al., 2021 14. Cavazza, T. ∙ Takeda, Y. ∙ Politi, A.Z. ... Parental genome unification is highly error-prone in mammalian embryos Cell. 2021; 184 :2860-2877 e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), this primarily results in whole-chromosome aneuploidies ( Bolton et al., 2016 9. Bolton, H. ∙ Graham, S.J.L. ∙ Van Der Aa, N. ... Mouse model of chromosome mosaicism reveals lineage-specific depletion of aneuploid cells and normal developmental potential Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11165 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and as a secondary consequence of micronucleation in chromothripsis ( Crasta et al., 2012 22. Crasta, K. ∙ Ganem, N.J. ∙ Dagher, R. ... DNA breaks and chromosome pulverization from errors in mitosis Nature. 2012; 482 :53-58 Crossref Scopus (831) PubMed Google Scholar ), rather than in the specific patterns of chromosome breakage described here. Replication stress as induced by aphidicolin can also lead to prolonged mitosis, multipolar spindles, and destabilize the segregation of the entire genome ( Wilhelm et al., 2014 105. Wilhelm, T. ∙ Magdalou, I. ∙ Barascu, A. ... Spontaneous slow replication fork progression elicits mitosis alterations in homologous recombination-deficient mammalian cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :763-768 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multipolar mitosis occurs spontaneously and commonly in human embryos, contributing to developmental failure ( Ottolini et al., 2017 71. Ottolini, C.S. ∙ Kitchen, J. ∙ Xanthopoulou, L. ... Tripolar mitosis and partitioning of the genome arrests human preimplantation development in vitro Sci Rep. Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :9744 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, prolonged mitosis correlates with aneuploidy and poor developmental potential ( Wong et al., 2010 107. Wong, C.C. ∙ Loewke, K.E. ∙ Bossert, N.L. ... Non-invasive imaging of human embryos before embryonic genome activation predicts development to the blastocyst stage Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :1115-1121 Crossref Scopus (584) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, replication stress can underly the mitotic abnormalities described by Cavazza, Ottolini, Wong, and colleagues.
Mitotic errors predominantly result in the loss of genetic material—gains are underrepresented relative to losses. This asymmetry persists throughout development: Turner syndrome arises through mosaic loss of one X chromosome ( Hook and Warburton, 1983 42. Hook, E.B. ∙ Warburton, D. The distribution of chromosomal genotypes associated with Turner's syndrome: livebirth prevalence rates and evidence for diminished fetal mortality and severity in genotypes associated with structural X abnormalities or mosaicism Hum. Genet. 1983; 64 :24-27 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, for meiotic errors, the ratio of losses/gains approximates 1 throughout preimplantation development ( Franasiak et al., 2014 33. Franasiak, J.M. ∙ Forman, E.J. ∙ Hong, K.H. ... The nature of aneuploidy with increasing age of the female partner: a review of 15, 169 consecutive trophectoderm biopsies evaluated with comprehensive chromosomal screening Fertil. Steril. 2014; 101 :656-663.e1 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and gains exceed losses in live births. Further differences in meiotic versus mitotic errors are seen in which chromosomes are affected. Segmental chromosome breaks primarily affect large chromosomes ( Girardi et al., 2020 35. Girardi, L. ∙ Serdarogullari, M. ∙ Patassini, C. ... Incidence, origin, and predictive model for the detection and clinical management of segmental aneuploidies in human embryos Am. J. Hum.

Segmental aneuploidy in human blastocysts: a qualitative and quantitative overview Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2019; 17 :76 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2018 117. Zhou, S. ∙ Cheng, D. ∙ Ouyang, Q. ... Prevalence and authenticity of de-novo segmental aneuploidy (>16 Mb) in human blastocysts as detected by next-generation sequencing Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2018; 37 :511-520 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas meiotic aneuploidies primarily affect smaller chromosomes, at least at advanced maternal age ( Gruhn et al., 2019 36. Gruhn, J.R. ∙ Zielinska, A.P. ∙ Shukla, V. ... Chromosome errors in human eggs shape natural fertility over reproductive life span Science. 2019; 365 :1466-1469 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, mitotic segregation errors inflict damage to the affected chromosome through breakage and fragmentation and thereby, commonly result in a chromosomal loss, as well as the demise of the affected cell or embryo. In contrast, segregation errors in meiosis can result in stable chromosomal gains and continued development.
Chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy are one of several possible outcomes of stalled replication forks and DSBs. In somatic cells, fragile sites are hotspots of de novo copy-number variation ( Wilson et al., 2015 106. Wilson, T.E. ∙ Arlt, M.F. ∙ Park, S.H. ... Large transcription units unify copy number variants and common fragile sites arising under replication stress Genome Res. 2015; 25 :189-200 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chromosomal break sites observed here coincide with sites of de novo copy-number change that can cause disease, including at GALNT13, IMMP2L, RGS7, and CHRM3 ( Shimojima et al., 2017 89. Shimojima, K. ∙ Okamoto, N. ∙ Yamamoto, T.

De novo 911 Kb interstitial deletion on chromosome 1q43 in a boy with mental retardation and short stature Eur. J. Med. Genet. 2012; 55 :117-119 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether these genetic changes occurred prior to or after fertilization is not known. Genetic mosaicism in the placenta, as well as mosaicism in adult tissues, points to early embryonic cell cycles as a source of frequent genetic change ( Coorens et al., 2021 20. Coorens, T.H.H. ∙ Oliver, T.R.W. ∙ Sanghvi, R. ... Inherent mosaicism and extensive mutation of human placentas Nature. 2021; 592 :80-85 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ju et al., 2017 48. Ju, Y.S. ∙ Martincorena, I. ∙ Gerstung, M. ...

Rodin, R.E. ∙ Dou, Y. ∙ Kwon, M. ... The landscape of somatic mutation in cerebral cortex of autistic and neurotypical individuals revealed by ultra-deep whole-genome sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24 :176-185 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the placenta, the majority of copy-number changes occur at fragile sites, including at sites of direct concordance with breakpoints in human preimplantation embryos, such as within IMMP2L, and may thus originate through the processes described here. Stalled replication forks and replication gaps may also contribute to point mutations through completion of DNA synthesis with error-prone translesion polymerases.
Taken together, DNA damage incurred during DNA replication underlies common defects in early human development, providing a rationale for additional studies on the limiting factors involved in replication fork stability and DSBs repair, on the location of replication origins, and the temporal patterns of DNA replication, as well as on the molecular causes of DNA replication stress in the early embryo. Such studies will be critical for understanding both normal and disease-causing genetic variation in the human germ line. Long term, it may lead to methods to reduce the risk of genetic abnormalities and reduce embryo attrition in human reproduction.
Stalled replication forks and postreplicative ssDNA gaps can both activate ATR signaling and involve MRE11-dependent processing. This study does not distinguish between these different possibilities. Such distinction may be achieved through the electron microscopy of replicated DNA or through S1 nuclease assays.
While this study was under consideration, another study reported low replication fork speed in fertilized mouse 2-cell and 8-cell embryos ( Nakatani et al., 2022 67. Nakatani, T. ∙ Lin, J. ∙ Ji, F. ... DNA replication fork speed underlies cell fate changes and promotes reprogramming Nat. Genet. 2022; 54 :318-327 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, another study showed in somatic cells that G2 DNA synthesis is a replication stress response to low fork speed induced by aphidicolin ( Mocanu et al., 2022 64. Mocanu, C. ∙ Karanika, E. ∙ Fernández-Casañas, M. ... DNA replication is highly resilient and persistent under the challenge of mild replication stress Cell Rep. 2022; 39 :110701 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).

The Columbia University Institutional Review Board, the Columbia University Embryonic Stem Cell Committee approved all human procedures to obtain human oocytes for this research, including for low pass genome sequencing and public database submission. Gamete and embryo donors provided informed consent, and followed guidance provided by New York State Stem Cell Science (NYSTEM, https://stemcell.ny.gov/new-model-informed-consent-forms ). The experience of oocyte donors in research is described in a prior study ( Zakarin Safier et al., 2018 115. Zakarin Safier, L. ∙ Gumer, A. ∙ Kline, M. ... Compensating human subjects providing oocytes for stem cell research: 9-year experience and outcomes J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. 2018; 35 :1219-1225 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Human oocytes designated for research were obtained from donors following routine gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist in vitro fertilization stimulation at the Columbia University Fertility Center. Ovarian stimulation was monitored with regular ultrasound and serum hormonal assays per practice protocol ( Palmerola et al., 2018 72. Palmerola, K.L. ∙ Rudick, B.J. ∙ Lobo, R.A. Low estradiol responses in oocyte donors undergoing gonadotropin stimulation do not influence clinical outcomes J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. 2018; 35 :1675-1682 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oocyte retrieval was performed by transvaginal ultrasound-guided needle aspiration under intravenous sedation. Oocytes were vitrified using Cryotech vitrification kit and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. For experimental procedures, oocytes were thawed using the Cryotech Warming Kit (Cryotech, Tokyo, Japan) or the ECMP warming solution set, then exposed to experimental conditions as outlined below. For the ensuing human oocyte studies, “control media” refers to Global Total. All experiments were conducted during incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 20% O2. Donated oocytes were used for experiments involving artificial activation and for experiments involving timing of DNA replication in zygotes, Cas9 injection, as well as for ICSI followed by aphidicolin incubation. Human oocytes were randomly allocated to experimental groups.
Cryopreserved human cleavage-stage and blastocyst embryos and unfertilized oocytes were anonymously donated from individuals and couples who provided consent for use in research. Embryos were of good quality and had been cryopreserved for potential clinical use, but were then no longer needed and donated for research. The cause of treatment is not disclosed. Range of maternal age of donated embryos is between 27-43. Embryos of both sexes were used, as provided by the unbiased fertilization of oocytes with sperm carrying either a Y or X chromosome. Cleavage stage embryos were thawed using the one-step thaw protocol using Global total with HEPES. Blastocyst stage embryos were thawed using the Quinn’s Advantage thaw kit, then exposed to experimental conditions as outlined below. Vitrified embryos were thawed with the ECMPC warming solution set. Embryo culture was performed in Global Total. All experiments were conducted during incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 20% O2.
Human sperm was obtained following donation from living donors following masturbation after 2-5 days of abstinence and collected in a Male-FactorPac collection kit. Sperm was cryopreserved using commercially prepared density gradient (Isolate) and centrifugation was used to isolate motile sperm. The resultant sperm pellet was resuspended in sperm prep medium (Quinn’s Sperm Washing Medium, Origio), centrifuged and washed repeatedly prior to cryopreservation using freezing medium (Irvine Scientific, 90128). Cryopreservation was performed using a time-based freezing protocol with gradually lowered temperature time sets then stored in liquid nitrogen at less than -196°C until use. Samples were thawed at 38–40 °C for a maximum of 10 min and transferred to a 15mL conical tube. Quinn’s Sperm Washing Medium was added dropwise to achieve a volume of 6mL. Samples were centrifuged at 300x g for 15min. Supernatant was removed and an additional wash with centrifugation was performed. The supernatant was removed following a second wash, sperm pellets resuspended in wash media, then analyzed for viability. Sperm was mixed on the stage of a microscope with 10%PVP, and individual motile sperm were immobilized by pressing the sperm tail with the ICSI micropipette to the bottom of the dish, then picked up for injection. Donated sperm was used to determine the timing of DNA replication in zygotes, as well as for ICSI followed by aphidicolin incubation.
The Columbia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal protocols. Mouse oocytes were obtained as described previously ( Yamada and Egli, 2017 112. Yamada, M. ∙ Egli, D. Genome transfer prevents fragmentation and restores developmental potential of developmentally compromised postovulatory aged mouse oocytes Stem Cell Rep. 2017; 8 :576-588 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, B6D2F1 female mice (Jackson strain #100006) were superovulated at 5-7 weeks of age by injection with 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (ProSpec) followed 48-52h later by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (EMD Millipore). Mice were sacrificed 14-15 hours later and oviducts were removed. Oocyte-cumulus complexes were isolated from the oviduct in a dish containing droplets of GMOPSplus (Vitrolife) containing 300 μg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich), covered with mineral oil on the heated stage of an Olympus SZ51 microscope. Oocytes were and then washed and cultured in Global Total until experimental use.
Embryos, mouse and human, were cultured in Global Total (Life-Global) for the duration of the experiments and with added compounds as outlined below.
Incubation in RNA polymerase inhibitors triptolide (1μM) or alpha amanitin (20μg/ml) was performed from the 2PN stage (day1) to day3 of human development. Incubation in aphidicolin was performed at 2 μM. This concentration of aphidicolin has been shown to prevent the formation of ssDNA gaps through uncoupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis ( Ercilla et al., 2020 29.

PFM01 ( Shibata et al., 2011 87. Shibata, A. ∙ Conrad, S. ∙ Birraux, J. ... Factors determining DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice in G2 phase EMBO J. 2011; 30 :1079-1092 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used at 50μM, and human zygotes were incubated from 14-19h post activation, while mouse zygotes were incubated from 11.5-15.5h post activation in aphidicolin and either mirin or PFM01. Mirin was used at a concentration of 50μM. Olaparib was used to inhibit PARP at a concentration of 10μM. All experiments were conducted during incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 19-20% O2. Chemical stock solutions were prepared in DMSO at concentrations at least 1000x higher than the final concentration.
gRNA was obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). For ribonucleoprotein (RNP) preparation, 2μL of 63μM IDT nlsCas9 v3, 3μL of injection buffer, and 1.5 μL of 100μM sgRNA were mixed and kept at room temperature for 5 minutes. Thereafter, 96.5μL of injection buffer consisting of 5mM Tris-HCl, 0.1mM EDTA, pH 7.8 was added prior to injection. gRNA targets on chr6, chr11, chr16 and chr17 are provided in the legend of Table S2 . Injection was performed into metaphase MII oocytes.
Artificial activation of human MII oocytes was performed using two pulses of 2.7kV/cm at 50μs using ECFG21 (Nepagene) in fusion buffer consisting of 0.25 M d-sorbitol buffer containing 0.1 mM calcium acetate, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM HEPES, and 1 mg ml −1 fatty-acid-free BSA as previously described ( Tachibana et al., 2013 91. Tachibana, M. ∙ Amato, P. ∙ Sparman, M. ... Human embryonic stem cells derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer Cell. 2013; 153 :1228-1238 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thereafter, oocytes were incubated for 3.5-4h in 10μg/ml puromycin, followed by a wash step and following culture in Global total.
Mouse oocytes were activated at 1-6 hours post retrieval using 2 μM ionomycin (Sigma Aldrich) in Global Total medium for 5 minutes at 37°C followed by culture in 10 μM puromycin and 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B for 3 hours, then cytochalasinB only for 2 hours and 10 minutes to prevent second polar body extrusion.
Following the experimental exposures, mouse and human embryos were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature, serially washed in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) at room temperature, then stored in PBS at 4°C until staining and imaging. Embryos were placed in 10-20μl droplets of primary antibody solution ( key resources table ) within plastic tissue culture dishes covered with mineral oil for 1 hour at room temperature, serially washed (x2) in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100 to prevent embryos sticking to oil, then transferred to 10-20μl secondary antibody solution and Hoechst (dilution 1:500) for 30 minutes. Embryos were then serially washed (x2) and placed in 5μl droplets of PBS with 0.5% serum albumin in uncoated glass bottom dishes (Mattek) covered with embryo culture oil for imaging. The following primary antibodies were used across experiments as described above: Oct-4, γH2AX, RPA32, RPA32 S4/S8, RPA32 S33, 53BP1, RAD51, Centromere, phospho-CHK1 ( key resources table ). Phospho-specific antibodies were quality controlled through ATR dependence of foci formation in mouse zygotes, and for γH2AX also in human zygotes ( Figures 1 E and S4 ). The RPA32 phospho S33 antibody does not react to an S33A mutant ( Anantha et al., 2007 3. Anantha, R.W. ∙ Vassin, V.M. ∙ Borowiec, J.A. Sequential and synergistic modification of human RPA stimulates chromosomal DNA repair J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :35910-35923 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X-Ser139 mouse monoclonal antibody does not react to S139A in human pluripotent stem cells ( Orlando et al., 2021 70. Orlando, L. ∙ Tanasijevic, B. ∙ Nakanishi, M. ... Phosphorylation state of the histone variant H2A.X controls human stem and progenitor cell fate decisions Cell Rep. 2021; 34 :108818 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RPA32 (S4/S8) rabbit antibody does not stain RPA32 mutant with serines turned to alanine ( Zuazua-Villar et al., 2015 119. Zuazua-Villar, P. ∙ Ganesh, A. ∙ Phear, G. ... Extensive RPA2 hyperphosphorylation promotes apoptosis in response to DNA replication stress in CHK1 inhibited cells Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :9776-9787 PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2012 59.

Distinct roles for DNA-PK, ATM and ATR in RPA phosphorylation and checkpoint activation in response to replication stress Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :10780-10794 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). The appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 555, CF 568, or Alexa Fluor 647 were diluted at 1:500-1:1000 ( key resources table ).
Ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling of zygotes and embryos was performed using the labeling kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described by the manufacturer. 10μM EdU was added to culture medium for 1 h at the indicated time points, and cells were harvested and fixed thereafter. 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) labeling was performed by incubating day3 cleavage stage embryos for 4 hours in Global total containing 0.2mM EU.
DNA fiber analysis was performed in mouse 1-cell embryos at 5.5h post activation, in late G2 phase from 12-15h post activation, in 8-cell embryos at 52h post activation, and in blastocysts at 96h post activation. Human 1-cell embryos were labeled 6h post activation, and donated day3 and day6 embryos were labeled within 3-4h after thawing. Incubation was performed in 25μM IdU or 25μM CldU for 30min. Digestion of zona pellucida by Acidic Tyrode's solution was performed in a 4-well dish at room temperature at ambient atmosphere for 1-5 minutes using continuous observation under a stereomicroscope, and then neutralized in culture medium. ∼30 cells were collected in 0.5-1μl medium and placed in a PCR tube, lysed by adding 30 μl of fresh pre-warmed (30 °C) spreading buffer (0.5% SDS, 200mM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM EDTA), incubated for 6 min at RT and stretched using gentle tilting on regular microscope slide. Slides were fixed for 2 min at RT in cold 3:1 methanol: acetic acid, air dried at RT, and then incubated in 2.5M HCl for 30 min, rinsed 5 times with PBS, and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1h. DNA fibers were stained for 1h with anti-ssDNA and anti-BrdU/IdU antibodies. Afterwards, slides were rinsed 4 times in PBS, incubated 1h with secondary antibodies (Goat anti-mouse IgG1, #A21121; Goat anti-mouse IgG2a, #20258), mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade mountant and let dry overnight. The fiber tracks were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope fitted with a PL Apo 40X/0.95 numerical aperture objective and measured using ImageJ software v1.53.
The length of each track was determined manually using the segmented line tool on ImageJ software. The pixel values were converted into μm using the scale bar generated by the microscope software. The extension of the DNA fibers was calculated as follows: 2.59 ± 0.24 kbp/μm according to ( Jackson and Pombo, 1998 45. Jackson, D.A. ∙ Pombo, A. Replicon clusters are stable units of chromosome structure: evidence that nuclear organization contributes to the efficient activation and propagation of S phase in human cells J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140 :1285-1295 Crossref Scopus (635) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Figure 2 , sister fork ratio was calculated as shorter fork/longer fork, with bidirectional forks only. Forks were considered asymmetric with a ratio <0.75 as ( Bester et al., 2011 7. Bester, A.C. ∙ Roniger, M. ∙ Oren, Y.S. ... Nucleotide deficiency promotes genomic instability in early stages of cancer development Cell. 2011; 145 :435-446 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (595) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Embryos were imaged with confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM (LSM 710) at a magnification of 63X and the Zeiss Zen software. Images were obtained using 488-, 543- and 633-nm lasers and bright-field microscopy. The number of confocal sections was adjusted to capture the entire nucleus or the entire embryo according to the experimental design as described above. Cell numbers and staining foci numbers were counted manually. Nuclei were identified by the presence of Hoechst33342. Foci were identified if at least 3x greater intensity than nuclear average, spherical in appearance, and overlapping with Hoechst33342 staining. Inner cell masses were identified by the presence of Oct4 within a blastocyst embryo. Active DNA replication was identified by the presence of EdU. DNA damage was identified by the detection of γH2AX and RPA foci within the nucleus. Mechanisms of DNA repair were identified through the detection of RPA S4/S8, RPA S33, Rad51 and 53BP1 foci within the nucleus.
Single cells from blastomeres were collected on the heated stage (Tokai Hit) of an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with Narishige micromanipulators and a zona pellucida laser (Hamilton-Thorne). Single nuclei were isolated from blastomeres by lysis and dissection of different nuclei using two 20μm diameter Piezo micropipettes and Holding pipette (Origio). Single embryo cells or nuclei were placed manually in single wells of a 96-well plate containing 9 μl of lysis buffer, prepared as a master mix of 798μl H 2 O, 6 μl of 10 mg/mL Proteinase K solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and 96μl 10X Single Cell Lysis and Fragmentation buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Single cells / single nuclei were lysed by heating 96-well plates containing single cells / single nuclei at 50°C for 1 hour, followed by incubation at 99°C for four minutes using a PCR thermocycler. Single-cell / single-nuclei whole genome amplification (WGA) using degenerate oligo-nucleotide priming PCR (DOP-PCR) was performed using the SEQPLEX Enhanced DNA Amplification Kit (SEQXE, Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In addition, a modified version of the DOP-PCR protocol that allows inline indexing of WGA DNA was also applied. WGA DNA was subsequently processed for Illumina library sequencing preparation using standard TruSeq indexing methods via the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (96 index primers) were used for four amplification cycles. Library DNA was quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and library size distribution was confirmed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A unimodal curve centered around 300 – 500 bp was scored as a successful library preparation. Subsequently, 30 μL of each pooled library was sent for sequencing at a concentration of 20ng/μl. Mutiplex sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 single end indexed run (SR100) while targeting a coverage of ∼1 million reads per cell/nuclei, sufficient for quantitative genome-wide copy number analysis.
Analysis of DNA sequencing data was performed as previously described ( Baslan et al., 2015 6. Baslan, T. ∙ Kendall, J. ∙ Ward, B. ... Optimizing sparse sequencing of single cells for highly multiplex copy number profiling Genome Res. 2015; 25 :714-724 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications as outlined below. Briefly, multiplex sequencing data were demultiplexed according to unique barcodes with reads assigned to their respective single-cell or single-nuclei. Unique reads were aligned to the reference human and mouse genome builds, hg19 and mm9, respectively. Each genome was partitioned into 5000 bins using a previously described algorithm (Varbin) that corrects for genome sequence mappability ( Baslan et al., 2012 5. Baslan, T. ∙ Kendall, J. ∙ Rodgers, L. ... Genome-wide copy number analysis of single cells Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :1024-1041 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ; Navin et al., 2011 68. Navin, N. ∙ Kendall, J. ∙ Troge, J. ... Tumour evolution inferred by single-cell sequencing Nature. 2011; 472 :90-94 Crossref Scopus (1851) PubMed Google Scholar ). Uniquely mapped reads were sorted, indexed and subsequently counted within the partitioned genomic bins. For single-cell copy number inference, read count data were normalized genome-wide followed by CBS segmentation ( Olshen et al., 2004 69. Olshen, A.B. ∙ Venkatraman, E.S. ∙ Lucito, R. ... Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data Biostatistics. 2004; 5 :557-572 Crossref Scopus (1620) PubMed Google Scholar ) and transformed into integer copy number states using a least-squares fit approach ( Baslan et al., 2015 6. Baslan, T. ∙ Kendall, J. ∙ Ward, B. ... Optimizing sparse sequencing of single cells for highly multiplex copy number profiling Genome Res. 2015; 25 :714-724 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Copy number inference from single-nuclei sequencing data was performed similarly with the exception that bin read counts were initially processed using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) resulting in two primary densities. One density contained very low read counts and was attributed to index switching during Illumina multiplex library sequencing, a known sequencing artifact ( Larsson et al., 2018 52. Larsson, A.J.M. ∙ Stanley, G. ∙ Sinha, R. ... Computational correction of index switching in multiplexed sequencing libraries Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :305-307 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bins constituting this density were normalized and transformed to a ground state (i.e. nullisomy). The second density contained high read counts in different genomic positions in one or more chromosomes across different single-nuclei. Read counts were processed similarly to single-cell data with the exception that segments were designated as “copy number states” (compared to absolute integer) given the inherent uncertainty of the absolute copy number of the segments in spontaneous micronuclei.
For increased resolution of break point mapping, additional analysis with bin size of 10kb, 50kb and 100kb using bwa aligner (v.0.7.17) ( Li and Durbin, 2009 56. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (27271) PubMed Google Scholar ), samtools (v.1.11) ( Danecek et al., 2021 23. Danecek, P. ∙ Bonfield, J.K. ∙ Liddle, J. ... Twelve years of SAMtools and BCFtools GigaScience. 2021; 10 Crossref Scopus (1174) Google Scholar ), and R package QDNAseq v1.26.0 ( Scheinin et al., 2014 84. Scheinin, I. ∙ Sie, D. ∙ Bengtsson, H. ... DNA copy number analysis of fresh and formalin-fixed specimens by shallow whole-genome sequencing with identification and exclusion of problematic regions in the genome assembly Genome Res. 2014; 24 :2022-2032 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed and results evaluated for consistency with analysis using 500kb bins described above ( Baslan et al., 2015 6. Baslan, T. ∙ Kendall, J. ∙ Ward, B. ... Optimizing sparse sequencing of single cells for highly multiplex copy number profiling Genome Res. 2015; 25 :714-724 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). All break point calls were also manually inspected on copy number plots and read number files independently by two researchers. Parthenogenetic 1-cell embryos were haploid, enhancing signal differences, and allowing for increased resolution of chromosomal break mapping to 10-50kb.
Annotation of break sites was performed as follows: transition points in segmented raw read count data were flagged across single-cell / single-nuclei datasets with subsequently manual curation using the University of California Santa Clara (UCSC) Genome Browser and transition point coordinates. A site was considered fragile if it occurred independently within the same or a neighboring bin (according to Baslan et al., 2015 6. Baslan, T. ∙ Kendall, J. ∙ Ward, B. ... Optimizing sparse sequencing of single cells for highly multiplex copy number profiling Genome Res. 2015; 25 :714-724 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) in at least three different embryos. A fragile area is defined by the bin coordinates within which the breaks fall (as in Figure 4 for CNTN5). Gene density comparison in Figure 5 G was performed by selecting random locations within hg19 genome assembly using bedtools v2.30.0 ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 77. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (12011) PubMed Google Scholar ). Complete transcripts and adjacent intergenic areas were included in 1-2Mb intervals to calculate the density of protein-coding genes. The genome average density of protein coding genes of ∼6.9 genes/Mb is based on an estimated 21,306 protein-coding genes ( Pertea et al., 2018 74. Pertea, M. ∙ Shumate, A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Thousands of large-scale RNA sequencing experiments yield a comprehensive new human gene list and reveal extensive transcriptional noise bioRxiv. 2018; 10.1101/332825 Google Scholar ) and a human genome size of 3.1 billion base pairs.
Statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Embryo groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons where appropriate, and using Student’s t-test for comparison between two groups. Fisher’s exact test was performed using https://www.socscistatistics.com/ to analyze sister fork asymmetry at different developmental stages, and to analyze development of human embryos with and without CHK1 inhibitor as indicated in Figure Legends. Mean and standard deviations are displayed as indicated in Figure Legends. The number of n indicated in the Figures represents the number of cells. In the case of zygotes, the number of embryos and the number of cells is equivalent.

Mapping of Cas9 induced segmental errors in parthenogenetic embryos on day 3 of development, related to STAR Methods and Figure S4E Cas9 guide RNA recognizes sites on chromosome 17 and on chromosome 16 near the centromere. Predicted cleavage sites (hg19): chr17:36,643,611; chr16:32003016; chr16:32946546; chr16:33710400. Due to cleavage near centromeric repeats on chromosome 16 there are 3 cleavage sites, and segmental transitions are not mapped accurately. The chromosome 17 cleavage site is unique on that chromosome. Target sites on chromosomes 16 and 17 are 5’-GGCGTTCAAGGACTTATTCA AGG , and 5’-GGCGTgCAAGGACTTATTCA AGG , target site allowing 1bp mismatch, Pam underlined. All 4 sites contain a SNP at that position, noted as rs1466000381, rs997949284, rs2659747. Both embryos with segmental copy number transitions on chromosome 17 had break points at the Cas9 cut site or immediately adjacent to it. One break point located ∼170kb centromeric the Cas9 cut site. Other copy number transitions mapped 0-40kb away from the Cas9 cut site, which is the accuracy of the mapping methods used in this study. Another gRNA targeting CNTN5 on chr11:99,690,376 (hg19) using gRNA sequence 5’-AATGAAGGGCTGCTGTATCG TGG was co-injected. Chromosomal break points located within 10kb to the Cas9 cut site, except one was ∼1Mb centromeric to the cut site. Attrition centromeric to the cut site was recently reported in another study ( Turocy et al., 2022 94. Turocy, J. ∙ Marin, D. ∙ Xu, S. ... DNA double strand breaks cause chromosome loss through sister chromatid tethering in human embryos bioRxiv. 2022; 2022.03.10.483502 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Other segmental chromosomal changes are presumed to be spontaneous, as they were not recurrent between different embryos and lacked a predicted off-target site. These sites were not included in the analysis of Table S4 or S6, but were noted to locate to gene-poor regions (see column I), just as seen in day3 fertilized embryos, adding further support to the conclusion that gene poor regions are fragile in the human embryo.

The type of sample, blastomere or isolated nucleus is indicated. Bolded mirroring changes have occurred at the first or second cell division and are included in the analysis of break points prior to embryonic genome activation in Figure 5I. These represent cells that kept dividing with a chromosomal break. ST3B. Tab 2 shows spontaneous break points of micronuclei in arrested human cleavage stage embryos. Break points of additional whole blastomeres of arrested embryos are indicated under column ‘sample type’. Embryos were made using ICSI of donated oocytes. ST3C. Tab 3 shows a summary of recurrent fragile sites in the human preimplantation embryo. ST3D. Tab 4 shows spontaneous break points in day1 and day 2 human cleavage stage embryos. 2PN zygotes were donated and allowed to develop to day 2, when they were collected as 4-cell cleavage stage embryos. Spreadsheet (20.94 KB) Table S4. Gene expression of transcripts at fragile sites in human preimplantation embryos, related to Figure 5 RPKM are indicated based on (Yan et al., 2013). Empty fields indicate cells/genes without detectable expression. The expression of POU5F1, which is upregulated between the 1-cell and the blastocyst stage, served as a positive control. Spreadsheet (49.93 KB) Table S5. Mapping of sites of G2 replication, related to Figure 6 ST5A. Tab 1. Genomic coordinates of copy number transitions after inhibition of replication completion in G2 phase with aphidicolin. Human parthenogenetic zygotes were exposed to aphidicolin at 15.5h post activation and allowed to cleave to collect individual nuclei. Human fertilized zygotes were incubated with aphidicolin at 18h post intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). ST5B. Tab 2: Efficiency of recovery of genomes as single nuclei from multinucleated haploid blastomeres. Data for 2 embryos are shown. A total of 46 chromosomes is expected. Spreadsheet (19.06 KB) Table S6. Mouse samples sequenced, related to Figure 7 Treatment is indicated in column C. Karyotypes are indicated in columns G and H. Aph = aphidicolin. CHK1 inhibitor AZD-7761 was used. Spreadsheet (26.20 KB) Table S7. Analysis of transcript levels in 1-cell embryos, related to STAR Methods and to Figures S6H and S7A Analysis of transcript levels of 69 factors involved in DNA replication fork stability and DSB repair and represented in two datasets GSE44183 (Xue et al., 2013) in RPKM, and GSE18290 (Xie et al., 2010) as microarray. Transcripts were considered differentially expressed if significant across both datasets (bolded lines). Grey shaded area: human.
