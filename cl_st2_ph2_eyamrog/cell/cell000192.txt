Title: A Network of Macrophages Supports Mitochondrial Homeostasis in the Heart


Abstract: Summary

Cardiomyocytes are subjected to the intense mechanical stress and metabolic demands of the beating heart. It is unclear whether these cells, which are long-lived and rarely renew, manage to preserve homeostasis on their own. While analyzing macrophages lodged within the healthy myocardium, we discovered that they actively took up material, including mitochondria, derived from cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes ejected dysfunctional mitochondria and other cargo in dedicated membranous particles reminiscent of neural exophers, through a process driven by the cardiomyocyte’s autophagy machinery that was enhanced during cardiac stress. Depletion of cardiac macrophages or deficiency in the phagocytic receptor Mertk resulted in defective elimination of mitochondria from the myocardial tissue, activation of the inflammasome, impaired autophagy, accumulation of anomalous mitochondria in cardiomyocytes, metabolic alterations, and ventricular dysfunction. Thus, we identify an immune-parenchymal pair in the murine heart that enables transfer of unfit material to preserve metabolic stability and organ function.

Section: Introduction

Macrophages are now known to be endowed with tissue-specific tasks unrelated to immunity ( Davies et al., 2013 15. Davies, L.C. ∙ Jenkins, S.J. ∙ Allen, J.E. ... Tissue-resident macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :986-995 Crossref Scopus (1542) PubMed Google Scholar ). These functions are prominent in the heart, where tissue-resident macrophages have been shown to prevent fibrosis ( Chakarov et al., 2019 11. Chakarov, S. ∙ Lim, H.Y. ∙ Tan, L. ... Two distinct interstitial macrophage populations coexist across tissues in specific subtissular niches Science. 2019; 363 :eaau0964 Crossref Scopus (612) PubMed Google Scholar ), facilitate electrical conduction in the atrioventricular node ( Hulsmans et al., 2017 24. Hulsmans, M. ∙ Clauss, S. ∙ Xiao, L. ... Macrophages Facilitate Electrical Conduction in the Heart Cell. 2017; 169 :510-522 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ), or to favor healing of injured areas ( Dick et al., 2019 18. Dick, S.A. ∙ Macklin, J.A. ∙ Nejat, S. ... Self-renewing resident cardiac macrophages limit adverse remodeling following myocardial infarction Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :29-39 Crossref Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nahrendorf and Swirski, 2013 40. Nahrendorf, M. ∙ Swirski, F.K. Monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity in the heart Circ. Res. 2013; 112 :1624-1633 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). Macrophages of unknown function also populate other regions of the healthy heart, including the ventricular myocardium ( Pinto et al., 2012 45. Pinto, A.R. ∙ Paolicelli, R. ∙ Salimova, E. ... An abundant tissue macrophage population in the adult murine heart with a distinct alternatively-activated macrophage profile PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e36814 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting broader homeostatic functions for heart-resident macrophages.
A primary function of macrophages is to eliminate unwanted material through phagocytosis ( Gordon, 2016 23. Gordon, S. Phagocytosis: An Immunobiologic Process Immunity. 2016; 44 :463-475 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (575) PubMed Google Scholar ). Illustrative of the relevance of this process, billions of cells die daily in healthy organisms, yet few apoptotic or dead cells can be detected in tissues ( Lemke, 2019 31. Lemke, G. How macrophages deal with death Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :539-549 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). Atypical modalities of phagocytosis also exist in which cellular fragments containing dysfunctional organelles are ejected for disposal ( Melentijevic et al., 2017 36. Melentijevic, I. ∙ Toth, M.L. ∙ Arnold, M.L. ... C. elegans neurons jettison protein aggregates and mitochondria under neurotoxic stress Nature. 2017; 542 :367-371 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ) and have been mostly described in the CNS where it may allow stressed cells to dispose of damaged material. Whether similar mechanisms exist in the heart, an organ subjected to high metabolic or mechanical stress, remains unexplored.
Cardiomyocytes are highly specialized in function and structurally unique; they display large sizes and a tight distribution of organelles, including mitochondria and sarcomeres, which occupy most of the cell volume and deal with the intense metabolic and mechanical demands of the heart. These demands are additionally challenging for cardiomyocytes because their estimated turnover in adult hearts is extremely low ( Bergmann et al., 2009 5. Bergmann, O. ∙ Bhardwaj, R.D. ∙ Bernard, S. ... Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans Science. 2009; 324 :98-102 Crossref Scopus (2492) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that dedicated mechanisms may have evolved to support cardiomyocyte function. Here, we show that cardiomyocytes partly solve these challenges through ejection of mitochondria and other material in subcellular vesicles. Efficient uptake of these vesicles by macrophages through the receptor Mertk, in turn, prevents extracellular accumulation of waste material, inflammasome activation, and autophagic block, altogether supporting heart homeostasis.

Section: Results

We focused on cardiac-resident macrophages (cMacs) that have been previously defined as CD45 + CD11b + F4/80 + , and three subsets originally defined on the basis of MHCII and Ly6C expression ( Epelman et al., 2014 20. Epelman, S. ∙ Lavine, K.J. ∙ Beaudin, A.E. ...

Med. 2014; 211 :2151-2158 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A). cMacs were of myeloid origin as determined by GFP expression in CX3CR1 GFP , Csf1r GFP , and LysM GFP reporter mice ( Burnett et al., 2004 9.

Biol. 2000; 20 :4106-4114 Crossref Scopus (2049) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 B). To examine the global distribution of cMacs in detail, we cleared hearts from healthy heterozygous CX3CR1 GFP adult male mice for whole-organ imaging. GFP + cMacs were ubiquitously distributed ( Figures 1 A and S1 C; Video S1 ), with an estimate of ∼3 × 10 5 cells per heart. cMacs were present at high density in the myocardium around both ventricles ( Figure 1 A). High-resolution imaging of thick heart sections of genetic mosaics of tdTtomato + cardiomyocytes or CX3CR1 GFP mice revealed that, on average, each cardiomyocyte was surrounded by five cMacs, and each cMac interacted with up to five cardiomyocytes through cellular processes ( Figures 1 B, S1 D, and S1E; Video S2 ), a finding that suggested parenchymal-immune crosstalk in the heart and potential housekeeping functions for cMacs.

Distribution of cMacs around Individual Cardiomyocytes, Related to Figure 1 3D imaging of hearts from inducible αMHC CRE-ERT ; Rosa26 TdTom reporter mice after low-dose tamoxifen, which allows generation of mosaic mice containing only a small fraction of cardiomyocytes expressing tdTomato (red). cMac staining with anti-CD68 (green) in these mice allows visualizing the number and distribution of cMacs around isolated cardiomyocytes in naive hearts. Autofluorescence (purple) shows the actual structure of non-labeled cardiomyocytes.
To explore the possible housekeeping functions of cMacs, we examined the consequences of their depletion in heart physiology. Among cardiac cells, only cMacs expressed the sialoadhesin CD169/ Siglec1 ( Figure S1 F), and we therefore took advantage of mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under this locus (CD169 DTR mice) ( Miyake et al., 2007 37. Miyake, Y. ∙ Asano, K. ∙ Kaise, H. ... Critical role of macrophages in the marginal zone in the suppression of immune responses to apoptotic cell-associated antigens J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117 :2268-2278 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ) to deplete cMacs from adult hearts ( Figure S1 G), without affecting other cardiac cell populations (not shown). Although the CD169 DTR model depletes macrophages in several organs, we did not find evidence of systemic inflammation or overt damage to other organs ( Table S1 ). Proteomic analysis of the myocardium at different times of cMac-depletion revealed global changes in protein composition over time ( Figure 1 C). These changes primarily affected mitochondrial proteins involved in bioenergetics, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteostasis ( Figures 1 D and S1 H). Interestingly, although many mitochondrial proteins were less represented after cMac-depletion ( Figure S1 H), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging revealed a significant increase in the number of mitochondria within cardiomyocytes, which we confirmed by immunostaining for mitochondrial protein Tom20 in heart sections ( Figures 1 E, S1 I, and S1J). Citrate synthase activity, an independent measure of mitochondrial mass, confirmed increased mitochondria content in the heart but not in the liver ( Figure S1 K), despite efficient depletion of macrophages in both tissues ( Figure S1 L). In addition to changes in number, mitochondria presented conspicuous alterations in morphology featuring increased area and reduced cristae density ( Figure 1 F), which suggested compromised fitness of cardiac mitochondria in the absence of cMacs. Accordingly, ATP production by purified cardiac mitochondria was significantly reduced in cMac-depleted mice regardless of the substrate used ( Figure 1 G), but was unaffected in the liver ( Figure S1 M), indicating that the effects were tissue-specific. Extracts of cMac-depleted hearts showed reduced ATPase β-subunit/GAPDH ratios (bioenergetic cellular index or BEC) ( Cuezva et al., 2004 14. Cuezva, J.M. ∙ Chen, G. ∙ Alonso, A.M. ... The bioenergetic signature of lung adenocarcinomas is a molecular marker of cancer diagnosis and prognosis Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25 :1157-1163 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 N), which aligned with increased phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios (PCr/ATP) in living hearts, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS) ( Figure S1 O). In functional terms, these findings suggested that depletion of cMacs promoted a metabolic switch toward preferential use of glucose for energy production, to compensate for defective oxidative phosphorylation and reduced ATP stores. Consistent with this notion, in vivo uptake of the glucose analog 2-deoxy-2-(18F)-fluoro-D-glucose ( 18 F-FDG) was elevated in cMac-depleted hearts ( Figure 1 H). Thus, hearts depleted of cMacs become defective at generating ATP and are metabolically unstable.
We next examined the effect of cMac depletion in left ventricular function. Longitudinal analyses of mice by echocardiographic imaging ( Figures 1 I and 1J) revealed loss of left ventricular volume and progressive reductions in E/A wave ratios, indicating diastolic dysfunction ( Figure 1 I). We additionally found reduced cardiac outputs after cMac-depletion ( Figure 1 J), indicating that the systolic function was also affected. Finally, direct hemodynamic analysis of cMac-depleted hearts confirmed the diastolic dysfunction, as reflected by reduced −dP/dtmin and Tau Weiss values (a measure of relaxation properties), and systolic defects shown by reduced dP/dtmax and end-systolic pressure ( Figure 1 K). Interestingly, depletion of cMacs followed by a recovery period resulted in restoration of left ventricular volume, E/A ratios, and cardiac output when cMacs repopulated the heart ( Figures S1 P and S1Q). Altogether, these data indicated that macrophages are needed for mitochondrial fitness, ventricular proteostasis, and pumping function.
Given the constant mechanical stress of the myocardium, we speculated that cMacs might facilitate removal of damaged cells. Consistently, isolated cMacs, but not cardiac monocytes, featured large phagolysosome-like vacuoles indicative of active phagocytosis ( Figure S2 A). To explore the phagocytic activity of cMacs, we first used bone marrow transplantation to generate chimeric mice in which we confirmed transfer of fluorescent material from the parenchyma into macrophages by flow cytometry ( Figures 2 A and S2 B) ( A-Gonzalez et al., 2017 1. A-Gonzalez, N. ∙ Quintana, J.A. ∙ García-Silva, S. ... Phagocytosis imprints heterogeneity in tissue-resident macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :1281-1296 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). To define the origin of the phagocytosed material, we generated various models in which only circulating leukocytes (parabiosis) ( A-Gonzalez et al., 2017 1. A-Gonzalez, N. ∙ Quintana, J.A. ∙ García-Silva, S. ... Phagocytosis imprints heterogeneity in tissue-resident macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :1281-1296 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ), endothelial cells (Cadh5 CreERT ; Rosa26 TdTom mice), or cardiomyocytes (αMHC Cre ; Rosa26 TdTom mice, referred to as Card RED mice) expressed red fluorescent protein. We found that cMacs took up abundant fluorescent material from circulating cells, cardiomyocytes, and, to a lesser extent, endothelial cells ( Figures 2 B and S2 C). Monocytes, in contrast, incorporated little fluorescence ( Figures 2 A and 2B), altogether revealing that cMacs actively and specifically take up material from surrounding cardiac cells in the steady state.
Uptake of cardiomyocyte-derived material was surprising given the low death rates of these cells in healthy individuals ( Bergmann et al., 2009 5. Bergmann, O. ∙ Bhardwaj, R.D. ∙ Bernard, S. ... Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans Science. 2009; 324 :98-102 Crossref Scopus (2492) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore examined the source of cardiomyocyte-derived material in Card RED mice. We found numerous subcellular particles (11.5 ± 1.3 per 100 μm 2 tissue) ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Video S3 ) whose tdTomato + fluorescence indicated a cardiomyocyte origin; we refer to these particles as “cardiac exophers,” in analogy to structures reported in C. elegans neurons ( Melentijevic et al., 2017 36. Melentijevic, I. ∙ Toth, M.L. ∙ Arnold, M.L. ... C. elegans neurons jettison protein aggregates and mitochondria under neurotoxic stress Nature. 2017; 542 :367-371 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cardiac exophers were relatively homogeneous in size (mean diameter 3.5 ± 0.1 μm; mean volume 31.0 ± 2.5 μm 3 ), much smaller than cardiomyocytes (∼0.2% of their volume, as estimated from Bensley et al. [2016 4. Bensley, J.G. ∙ De Matteo, R. ∙ Harding, R. ... Three-dimensional direct measurement of cardiomyocyte volume, nuclearity, and ploidy in thick histological sections Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :23756 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ]) or cMacs ( Figure S2 D). Around 40% of exophers were in contact with or inside cMacs ( Figures 2 C–2E and S2 E; Video S3 ), indicating that they were part of the phagocytosed material. The proximity of exophers to cMacs could not be explained by random distribution ( Figure S2 F), and we ruled out horizontal transfer of tdTomato-encoding mRNA to cMacs as a mechanism of fluorescence acquisition ( Figure S2 G), altogether suggesting uptake of cardiomyocyte-derived exophers by cMacs in the healthy myocardium.

In the second part of the video we introduce Tom20 staining (white) to show the presence of mitochondria inside the captured exophers. Nuclei are labeled with DAPI (blue).
TEM of heart sections revealed conspicuous presence of mitochondria ( Figure 2 F) and, in some instances, sarcomeric fragments inside extracellular exopher-like vesicles ( Figure S2 H). We found similar structures and cMacs in human myocardia ( Figures S2 I and S2J; Table S2 ). To characterize the content of these particles, we purified exophers as small tdTomato bright particles devoid of nuclei from pools of hearts of Card RED mice ( Figures S2 K and S2L). Staining with two different probes that accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix confirmed the presence of mitochondria in isolated exophers ( Figure 2 G), and comparison of the proteome of purified exophers with that of total cardiac tissue revealed massive enrichment of mitochondrial proteins and reduction in proteins from all other cellular compartments ( Figures 2 H and S2 M). Intriguingly, we noted that several proteins involved in mitochondrial integrity were reduced in exophers, including Opa1, Fis1, Cytc, and Aifm1 ( Figure S2 M), suggesting that mitochondria within exophers might be dysfunctional ( Duvezin-Caubet et al., 2006 19. Duvezin-Caubet, S. ∙ Jagasia, R. ∙ Wagener, J. ... Proteolytic processing of OPA1 links mitochondrial dysfunction to alterations in mitochondrial morphology J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :37972-37979 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ; Joza et al., 2001 25. Joza, N. ∙ Susin, S.A. ∙ Daugas, E. ... Essential role of the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor in programmed cell death Nature. 2001; 410 :549-554 Crossref Scopus (1186) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mai et al., 2010 34.

Cell Sci. 2010; 123 :917-926 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed the proteomic data by immunofluorescence staining of myocardial tissue, with consistent presence in exophers of mitochondrial and sarcomeric proteins, proteins from various other organelles, and absence of DAPI + nuclear fragments ( Figures 2 I, 2J, and S2 N). These data thus revealed preferential, but not exclusive, extrusion of mitochondria into exophers for discharge from healthy cardiomyocytes.
Our TEM analyses revealed mitochondria-containing exophers in the periphery of cardiomyocytes that were taken up by adjacent cells similar in size and morphology with cMacs ( Hulsmans et al., 2017 24. Hulsmans, M. ∙ Clauss, S. ∙ Xiao, L. ... Macrophages Facilitate Electrical Conduction in the Heart Cell. 2017; 169 :510-522 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A). Consistently, 3D immunofluorescence imaging revealed Tom20 + exophers inside CD68 + cMacs ( Figures 3 B and 3C; Video S3 ), suggesting exopher-mediated transfer of mitochondria from cardiomyocytes to cMacs.
To confirm this, we used two complementary strategies. We first transplanted BL/6.SJL C57 mice with bone marrow from conplastic BL/6 NZB donor mice. These mouse strains have C57BL/6 nuclear genomes, but distinct mitochondrial DNA haplotypes (C57 and NZB, respectively) ( Latorre-Pellicer et al., 2016 30. Latorre-Pellicer, A. ∙ Moreno-Loshuertos, R. ∙ Lechuga-Vieco, A.V. ... Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA matching shapes metabolism and healthy ageing Nature. 2016; 535 :561-565 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ) that can be discriminated by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays. These mice also expressed different isoforms of CD45 that discriminated donor from recipient-derived cMacs, thereby allowing identification of parenchyma-derived mitochondria in the transplanted cMacs ( Figure S3 A). cMacs from BL/6 NZB donors purified from BL/6.SJL C57 hearts incorporated parenchymal C57-derived mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) at much higher rates than macrophages from any other tissue tested ( Figure 3 D). Only the skeletal muscle revealed low transfer of mtDNA, thereby indicating strong heart-specific transfer of parenchymal mitochondria into cMacs.
To determine whether cardiomyocytes were the source of mitochondria transferred to cMacs, we next analyzed the transfer of cardiomyocyte-borne mitochondrial protein. We enforced expression of a monomeric Keima fluorescent protein bearing a mitochondria-directing peptide (mt-Keima) in cardiomyocytes ( Figure S3 B) ( Sun et al., 2015 52. Sun, N. ∙ Yun, J. ∙ Liu, J. ... Measuring In Vivo Mitophagy Mol. Cell. 2015; 60 :685-696 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ). We ensured cell-specific transduction by using a cardiotropic adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) and the cardiomyocyte-specific Tnnt2 promoter to drive mt-Keima expression in cardiomyocytes but not in cMacs ( Figures S3 B and S3C). Immunofluorescence staining revealed the presence of mt-Keima in exophers ( Figures S3 D and S3E), and abundant mt-Keima + particles that concentrated inside CD68 + macrophages ( Figures 3 E and 3F; Video S4 ), indicating transfer of cardiomyocyte-borne mitochondria into cMacs.

Uptake of Cardiomyocyte-Derived Mitochondria into LAMP1 + Phagolysosomes in cMacs, Related to Figure 3 Reconstruction and 3D view of the myocardium of a mouse infected with AAV9-mtKeima vector. The reconstruction shows mt-Keima-tagged mitochondria derived from a cardiomyocyte (red) that have been phagocytosed by a cMac (green). Note that the mitochondria is contained inside a Lamp1+ lysosomal compartment (white). Nuclei are labeled with DAPI (blue), and autofluorescence is used to visualize cardiomyocytes (cyan).
mt-Keima protein changes excitation wavelength at different pH, thus changing fluorescence properties when entering phagolysosomes ( Sun et al., 2017 53. Sun, N. ∙ Malide, D. ∙ Liu, J. ... A fluorescence-based imaging method to measure in vitro and in vivo mitophagy using mt-Keima Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1576-1587 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that mt-Keima within cMacs presented fluorescence ratios indicative of a more acidic environment ( Figure S3 F), suggesting that they were targeted for degradation in these cells. Consistently, the majority of mt-Keima + mitochondria in cMacs were in Lamp1 + phagolysosomes ( Figure S3 G; Video S4 ). In addition, cMacs isolated from mt-Keima-transduced hearts, or from BL/6 NZB -transplanted BL/6.SJL C57 mice, lost most of the mt-Keima fluorescence or BL/6 NZB mtDNA after only 2 or 3 days of culture, respectively ( Figure 3 G), indicating degradation of the engulfed mitochondria. Finally, we found that the majority of acidic mt-Keima + particles in the myocardium localized inside cMacs (62.7% ± 9%; Figure S3 H), and in vitro imaging revealed exchange of exopher-like particles between cardiomyocytic cells and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified cMacs ( Figures S3 I–S3K; Video S5 ). Thus, a large fraction of mitochondria extruded in exophers are taken up and eliminated by neighboring macrophages.

Cardiomyocyte and cMac Coculture, Related to Figure 3 Time-lapse video of cardiomyocytes (Hl1 GFP cell line, in green) and cMacs (sorted from DsRed mice, in red) co-cultured for two h. Yellow arrows indicate cardiomyocyte-derived exophers. Scale bar is 20 μm.
Given the consistent reduction of components associated with mitochondrial fitness in our proteomic analysis ( Figures S2 M and S4 A), and the observation that peripheral mitochondria often accumulated in budding vesicles in the periphery of cardiomyocytes ( Figure S4 B), we hypothesized that exophers allowed disposal of dysfunctional mitochondria. Using a binary criteria to score mitochondrial fitness from TEM images as normal or abnormal based on outer and inner membrane integrity, cristae density, and organization ( Figure S4 C), we found a progressive decline in fitness from perinuclear to border regions of the cardiomyocyte, with the highest frequency of aberrant mitochondria in exophers ( Figures S4 D and S4E). This finding agreed with dramatic disruption of the membrane potential and unresponsiveness to hyperpolarizing agents ( Figure S4 F), as well as reduced citrate synthase ( Figure S4 G) of mitochondria present in exophers, indicating that damaged mitochondria accumulate in the periphery of cardiomyocytes and are ejected in exophers.
These findings raised the possibility that exopher production was related to autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved system that mediates disposal of organelles. Consistently, we found LC3 + positive puncta (that identify autophagosomes) ( Mizushima et al., 2004 38. Mizushima, N. ∙ Yamamoto, A. ∙ Matsui, M. ... In vivo analysis of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation using transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent autophagosome marker Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15 :1101-1111 Crossref Scopus (2034) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the majority of exophers present in heart sections and by flow cytometry in isolated exophers ( Figures 4 A and 4B). To assess a role for autophagy in exopher formation, we next used two complementary strategies. First, we induced autophagy through inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin. Second, we specifically blocked autophagy in cardiomyocytes by genetic deletion of Atg7 ( García-Prat et al., 2016 22. García-Prat, L. ∙ Martínez-Vicente, M. ∙ Perdiguero, E. ... Autophagy maintains stemness by preventing senescence Nature. 2016; 529 :37-42 Crossref Scopus (1009) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 C). Treatment of Card RED mice with rapamycin increased exopher numbers in the myocardium ( Figure 4 D) and enhanced the uptake of cardiomyocyte-derived fluorescence and mt-Keima by cMacs ( Figures 4 E and 4F). We then impaired cardiac-specific autophagy by deletion of one Atg7 allele from cardiomyocytes, a manipulation that led to suppression of autophagy flux, yet allowed better survival than full gene deletion ( Figures S4 H and S4I). Hemizygous mice manifested dramatic reduction of cardiac exophers ( Figure 4 G), which was accompanied by reduced uptake of cardiomyocyte-derived fluorescent protein and mt-Keima by cMacs ( Figures 4 H and 4I). Thus, exopher formation and mitochondrial transfer is driven by the autophagy machinery of cardiomyocytes.
Disposal of mitochondria-laden exophers by cMacs suggested that they might prevent accumulation of inflammogenic material in the myocardial tissue and downstream detrimental effects seen when cMacs were depleted ( Figures 1 C–1K). To explore this possibility, we generated and imaged hearts from CD169 DTR ;aMHC Cre ;Rosa26 tdTom mice to score exopher content after cMac depletion. As expected by their role in taking up these vesicles, exopher content doubled after only 2 days of cMac depletion ( Figure 5 A), and there was marked accumulation of free mitochondria in the cardiac extracellular space after long-term macrophage depletion ( Figures 5 B and S5 A).
Unexpectedly, we noticed that depletion of cMacs for longer times resulted in progressive decline in exopher numbers, with almost complete absence of exophers after 3 weeks ( Figure 5 A). Because autophagy drives exopher production ( Figure 4 ), we hypothesized that prolonged cMac depletion might interfere with cardiomyocyte autophagy, thereby impairing exopher production. Analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes confirmed that sustained depletion of cMacs (7–21 days) completely blocked the autophagy flux ( Figures 5 C and S5 B), whereas short-term depletion (2 days) did not ( Figure S5 C). Combined, these data suggested that while cMacs are not directly involved in eliciting exopher release by cardiomyocytes, they are necessary to sustain normal cardiac autophagy. Hence, long-term depletion of cMacs blunts exopher production and cause proteostatic defects and proteome alterations in cMac-depleted hearts ( Figures 1 C and 1D).
Free mitochondria and mtDNA can activate the inflammasome and elicit cardiac damage ( Oka et al., 2012 43. Oka, T. ∙ Hikoso, S. ∙ Yamaguchi, O. ... Mitochondrial DNA that escapes from autophagy causes inflammation and heart failure Nature. 2012; 485 :251-255 Crossref Scopus (939) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2011 61. Zhou, R. ∙ Yazdi, A.S. ∙ Menu, P. ... A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation Nature. 2011; 469 :221-225 Crossref Scopus (4140) PubMed Google Scholar ); in agreement with this possibility, western blot analyses revealed inflammasome activation in hearts of cMac-depleted mice ( Figure 5 D). Inflammasome activation, in turn, can inhibit autophagy ( Yu et al., 2014 60. Yu, J. ∙ Nagasu, H. ∙ Murakami, T. ... Inflammasome activation leads to Caspase-1-dependent mitochondrial damage and block of mitophagy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :15514-15519 Crossref Scopus (363) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising the possibility that impaired mitochondria removal and inflammasome activation in the absence of cMacs caused the observed autophagic arrest and impaired exopher production. Indeed, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in cMac-depleted mice using the small-molecule inhibitor MCC950 ( Figure S5 D) ( Coll et al., 2015 12. Coll, R.C. ∙ Robertson, A.A.B. ∙ Chae, J.J. ... A small-molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome for the treatment of inflammatory diseases Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :248-255 Crossref Scopus (1947) PubMed Google Scholar ) rescued the autophagic block ( Figure 5 E), and partially restored exopher formation in hearts from these mice ( Figure 5 F). These data are consistent with a model in which cMacs preserve cardiomyocyte proteostasis by removing cardiac exophers, thereby preventing inflammasome activation and autophagy block. These housekeeping roles of cMacs may ultimately explain the dramatic impact of their depletion in mitochondrial quality and cardiac function ( Figures 1 C–1K).
We next questioned the capacity of exopher-mediated disposal of mitochondria to adapt to situations of cardiac stress. We treated Card RED mice with isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist that causes cardiomyocyte damage through mitochondrial stress ( Acin-Perez et al., 2018 2. Acin-Perez, R. ∙ Lechuga-Vieco, A.V. ∙ Del Mar Muñoz, M. ... Ablation of the stress protease OMA1 protects against heart failure in mice Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaan4935 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Isoproterenol treatment induced loss of mitochondrial quality in cardiomyocytes as assessed by TEM analysis ( Figures 6 A and 6B), and this was paralleled by a marked increase in the number of cardiac exophers ( Figure 6 C), as well as elevated transfer of cardiomyocyte-derived fluorescence and mt-Keima into cMacs ( Figures 6 D and 6E), thereby revealing a dynamic response of exopher-mediated transfer of mitochondria during cardiac stress. We also analyzed hearts after myocardial infarction in Card RED mice. Although analyses involving cMacs were not possible after cardiac ischemia given the massive infiltration of inflammatory macrophages in regions devoid of cardiomyocytes ( Figure S6 A), we found areas in the periphery of the infarcted myocardium that became enriched in cardiomyocyte-derived particles ( Figure S6 B). These particles shared with exophers a similar morphology, presence of mitochondria, and absence of actin ( Figure S6 C), suggesting elevated formation of cardiac exophers after ischemia. Consistent with the organ-supporting functions of cMacs ( Figure 1 ), the effects of isoproterenol were more severe in cMac-depleted mice as revealed by echocardiography and creatinine kinase levels in plasma ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Similarly, depletion of cMacs prior to ischemia resulted in early mortality upon reperfusion ( Figure S6 F). Thus, mitochondrial disposal through exophers occurs in a range of pathophysiological conditions and is enhanced under conditions of stress.
The presence of mitochondria in exophers and transfer into cMacs in healthy hearts suggested that this might represent a homeostatic mechanism of disposal independent of organelle fitness. In contrast, the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria in border zones and exophers ( Figures S4 D–S4G) suggested that exophers could alternatively allow sorting of defective mitochondria for elimination, thereby providing a mechanism of quality control. To evaluate these possibilities, we tested whether genetic protection from isoproterenol-induced stress in Oma1 -deficient mice, which are protected from mitochondrial damage ( Acin-Perez et al., 2018 2. Acin-Perez, R. ∙ Lechuga-Vieco, A.V. ∙ Del Mar Muñoz, M. ... Ablation of the stress protease OMA1 protects against heart failure in mice Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 :eaan4935 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), affected exopher formation. We found that preservation of mitochondrial quality in Oma1 −/− mice blunted mitochondria transfer to cMacs in response to isoproterenol ( Figure 6 E), suggesting that exopher release by cardiomyocytes is causally associated with mitochondrial health.
Using flow cytometry, we noticed that exophers expressed on their surface phosphatidyl-serine (PS) ( Figure 7 A), an “eat-me” signal typically found on apoptotic cells that is recognized directly or indirectly by various phagocytic receptors in macrophages. Among these, the tyrosine kinase Mertk has been shown to be active in cardiac macrophages ( DeBerge et al., 2017 17. DeBerge, M. ∙ Yeap, X.Y. ∙ Dehn, S. ... MerTK cleavage on resident cardiac macrophages compromises repair after myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury Circ. Res. 2017; 121 :930-940 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wan et al., 2013 58. Wan, E. ∙ Yeap, X.Y. ∙ Dehn, S. ... Enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic cardiomyocytes through myeloid-epithelial-reproductive tyrosine kinase links acute inflammation resolution to cardiac repair after infarction Circ. Res. 2013; 113 :1004-1012 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which it was expressed at high levels ( Figures S7 A and S7B), and mediates the removal of dysfunctional subcellular fragments in other tissues ( Lemke, 2019 31. Lemke, G. How macrophages deal with death Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :539-549 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using annexin V as a probe, we found PS + patches in fresh ventricular sections that were distributed through the myocardium in proximity to CX3CR1 GFP cMacs ( Figures 7 B and 7C). Importantly, transfer of cardiomyocyte-derived mt-Keima + mitochondria into cMacs was severely compromised in Mertk −/− mice, even after controlling for mt-Keima transduction efficiency ( Figure 7 D). Consistently, we found accumulation of free mitochondria in the extracellular space of Mertk -deficient hearts ( Figure 7 E) despite higher number of cMacs in these mice ( Figure S7 C), as well as activation of the inflammasome and blunted autophagy ( Figures S7 D–S7F). These observations predicted mitochondrial alterations in cardiomyocytes from Mertk −/− mice; indeed, we found that cardiomyocytes displayed increased mitochondrial content ( Figures 7 F and S7 G), but these mitochondria featured reduced cristae density ( Figure 7 G) and diminished ATP production that was evident in older Mertk −/− mice ( Figure S7 H). These data indicated loss of mitochondrial quality and suggested alterations in the functional and metabolic properties of Mertk -deficient hearts. Accordingly, echocardiographic analyses revealed reduced left ventricle E/A ratios ( Figure S7 I), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging demonstrated increased in vivo uptake of 18 F-FDG compared with wild-type controls ( Figure 7 H), thereby recapitulating the defects seen in cMac-depleted hearts ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Thus, Mertk is a relevant receptor for exophers, and its absence causes accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and metabolic anomalies in the heart.

Section: Discussion

The massive energetic demand of the heart makes this organ uniquely reliant on a vast pool of functional mitochondria to continuously generate high-energy phosphates. Mechanisms that ensure mitochondrial health in cardiomyocytes, including elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy, are therefore crucial for cardiac function and have been the focus of intense scrutiny ( Tong and Sadoshima, 2016 54. Tong, M. ∙ Sadoshima, J. Mitochondrial autophagy in cardiomyopathy Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2016; 38 :8-15 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Existing models, however, assume that disposal of mitochondria and other intracellular material is completed within the cell, an assumption with important implications in terms of the involved molecular mediators, turnover rates, energetic cost, and potential activation of danger sensors in the heart. Here, we identify a non-canonical route for elimination of a large fraction of mitochondria and other organelles from healthy cardiomyocytes that is driven by components of the autophagy machinery, yet uniquely relies in membranous structures (exophers) for extrusion of cellular waste, including abnormal mitochondria, into the extracellular space. The extruded material is readily taken up and processed by a network of resident macrophages that surround cardiomyocytes through the phagocytic receptor Mertk. Failure to eliminate mitochondria-laden exophers results in activation of the inflammasome and autophagy arrest, ultimately compromising mitochondrial fitness, tissue proteostasis, and cardiac function.
A key observation was the detection in the healthy myocardium of cardiomyocyte-derived fragments, which was surprising, because these fragments originated from otherwise viable cells and were enriched in damaged mitochondria. These vesiculated fragments had properties that differentiate them from classical extracellular vesicles ( Colombo et al., 2014 13. Colombo, M. ∙ Raposo, G. ∙ Théry, C. Biogenesis, secretion, and intercellular interactions of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30 :255-289 Crossref Scopus (4530) PubMed Google Scholar ), including size (in the range of microns), cargo (large organelles), and mechanism of formation (autophagy versus endosomal origin). Instead, these cardiomyocyte-derived fragments shared traits with neural exophers, most notably the capacity to transport cargo for disposal out of the cell ( Melentijevic et al., 2017 36. Melentijevic, I. ∙ Toth, M.L. ∙ Arnold, M.L. ... C. elegans neurons jettison protein aggregates and mitochondria under neurotoxic stress Nature. 2017; 542 :367-371 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). These features suggest a specialized function for exophers in supporting cardiac proteostasis.
Our findings have a number of potential implications. First, they reveal that autophagy in the mammalian heart can be completed by exchange of material between cells, a trans -cellular process so far reported only in certain areas of the CNS ( Davis et al., 2014 16. Davis, C.H. ∙ Kim, K.-Y. ∙ Bushong, E.A. ... Transcellular degradation of axonal mitochondria Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :9633-9638 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, they predict the existence of biochemical mediators in cardiomyocytes dedicated to sort unfit mitochondria and other material to exophers for ejection out of the cell. Third, our findings establish a central, previously undescribed role for heart-resident macrophages in preserving cardiac homeostasis beyond those related to electrical conductance ( Hulsmans et al., 2017 24. Hulsmans, M. ∙ Clauss, S. ∙ Xiao, L. ... Macrophages Facilitate Electrical Conduction in the Heart Cell. 2017; 169 :510-522 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ), the only homeostatic role thus far reported for cMacs in the healthy heart. A technical limitation of our study was the inability to specifically deplete cardiac macrophages due to the lack of a tissue-specific model, and therefore we cannot formally exclude the possible influence of CD169 + macrophages from other organs in cardiac physiology.
We propose that this unique type of “subrogated” elimination of cellular waste from cardiomyocytes to cMacs may be a necessary feature of the heart that originates from the physiological constraints of the cardiomyocyte, a cell that must function uninterruptedly throughout the organism’s lifetime, and features a tightly packed cytoplasm that may hamper efficient autophagy. In light of these constraints, it is not surprising that assisted elimination of the most abundant organelle (i.e., mitochondria) by neighboring cMacs ensures mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte fitness, while failure of this mechanism, as may occur during aging, could compromise organ function ( Rawji et al., 2016 47. Rawji, K.S. ∙ Mishra, M.K. ∙ Michaels, N.J. ... Immunosenescence of microglia and macrophages: impact on the ageing central nervous system Brain. 2016; 139 :653-661 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Phagocytosis of subcellular particles from otherwise viable cells has been reported under specific contexts and tissues and typically allows cells to get rid of dysfunctional or unnecessary structures, as seen for maturing erythrocytes and sperm or for some types of neurons ( Lemke, 2019 31. Lemke, G. How macrophages deal with death Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :539-549 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, while there exist precedents for material ejection from living cells and transfer to neighboring cells ( Melentijevic et al., 2017 36. Melentijevic, I. ∙ Toth, M.L. ∙ Arnold, M.L. ... C. elegans neurons jettison protein aggregates and mitochondria under neurotoxic stress Nature. 2017; 542 :367-371 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ), the heart appears unique in the massive amount of exchanged material, which accounts for more than half of all mitochondria, and the preference of this process toward a type of organelle (the mitochondria). We predict, nonetheless, that similar dependence on exopher production and uptake by neighboring macrophages may occur in other populations of long-lived cells subjected to constant physiological stress. For example, the absence of Mertk is causally associated with defective removal of photoreceptor outer segments from viable cells in the retina, resulting in blindness ( Lemke, 2019 31. Lemke, G. How macrophages deal with death Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :539-549 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genetic models that enable tracking mitochondria or other organelles from specific sources to tissue-resident macrophages will be needed to define the prevalence of this mechanism in tissues not explored in our study.
In summary, identification of active elimination of cardiomyocyte-derived mitochondria and other material by surrounding cMacs establishes a paradigm for how resident phagocytes contribute to global tissue homeostasis. It also predicts that cardiac dysfunction may, in some instances, emanate from defects in resident immune cells, rather than from cardiomyocytes, a concept with important consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease.

We obtained papillary muscles from the heart of patients undergoing mitral valve replacement. Inclusion criteria for patients that donated cardiac tissue were age older than 18 years and in need of mitral valve replacement. Emergency procedures were the only exclusion criteria. Five patients were included between July and September 2017. Baseline clinical characteristics of patients are described in Table S2 . Patients were anesthetized as usual following our local protocol. Median sternotomy and aortic and double venous cannulation were standard. Normothermic bypass was initiated after heparinitation. After antegrade cardioplegia the heart was arrested and left atrial was opened. Mitral valve was excised cutting mitral chordes and the head of papillary muscles. A portion of the papillary muscles head was stored in PFA 4% Glutaraldehyde 1% (for electron microscopy) or PFA 2% (for immunofluorescence), following the protocols described below. This study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the local ethics committee at Hospital Universitario de la Princesa (Madrid). Written informed consent was obtained from every patient.
Unless otherwise specified, all experiments were performed in 8- to 18-week-old male mice in a C57BL/6 background. We used heterozygous CX3CR1 GFP ( Jung et al., 2000 26. Jung, S. ∙ Aliberti, J. ∙ Graemmel, P. ... Analysis of fractalkine receptor CX(3)CR1 function by targeted deletion and green fluorescent protein reporter gene insertion Mol. Cell.

Transgenic mice expressing DsRed under the control of the β-actin promoter (referred to as WT RED ) ( Vintersten et al., 2004 55. Vintersten, K. ∙ Monetti, C. ∙ Gertsenstein, M. ... Mouse in red: red fluorescent protein expression in mouse ES cells, embryos, and adult animals Genesis. 2004; 40 :241-246 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ), and mice expressing DTR in the Cd169 locus (CD169 DTR ) ( Miyake et al., 2007 37. Miyake, Y. ∙ Asano, K. ∙ Kaise, H. ... Critical role of macrophages in the marginal zone in the suppression of immune responses to apoptotic cell-associated antigens J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117 :2268-2278 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ) were also used. Mice deficient in Oma1 were generated as described ( Quirós et al., 2012 46. Quirós, P.M. ∙ Ramsay, A.J. ∙ Sala, D. ... Loss of mitochondrial protease OMA1 alters processing of the GTPase OPA1 and causes obesity and defective thermogenesis in mice EMBO J. 2012; 31 :2117-2133 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CD169 DTR ; αMHC Cre ; Rosa26 Tdtom , and LC3-GFP; αMHC Cre ; Rosa26 Tdtom mice were generated by crossing αMHC Cre Rosa26 Tdtom with CD169 DTR or with LC3-GFP ( Mizushima et al., 2004 38. Mizushima, N. ∙ Yamamoto, A. ∙ Matsui, M. ... In vivo analysis of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation using transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent autophagosome marker Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15 :1101-1111 Crossref Scopus (2034) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. Mice deficient in Mertk have been previously described ( A-Gonzalez et al., 2017 1. A-Gonzalez, N. ∙ Quintana, J.A. ∙ García-Silva, S. ... Phagocytosis imprints heterogeneity in tissue-resident macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :1281-1296 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Constitutive or conditional hemizigosity in the Atg7 gene was achieved by crossing αMHC Cre or αMHC CreERT with Atg7 flox mice ( Komatsu et al., 2005 28. Komatsu, M. ∙ Waguri, S. ∙ Ueno, T. ... Impairment of starvation-induced and constitutive autophagy in Atg7-deficient mice J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169 :425-434 Crossref Scopus (2047) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. Atg7 flox mice and LC3-GFP mice were kindly provided by Dr. Marco Sandri (University of Padova, Italy) and Dr. Guillermo Mariño (Uiversity of Oviedo, Spain), respectively. Finally, SJL CD45.1 mice from Jackson Laboratory (referred to as CD45.1 or BL/6.SJL C57 ) and a conplastic mouse strain with the nuclear genome of C57BL/6 but mitochondrial DNA of NZB (referred to as BL/6 NZB ) ( Latorre-Pellicer et al., 2016 30. Latorre-Pellicer, A. ∙ Moreno-Loshuertos, R. ∙ Lechuga-Vieco, A.V. ... Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA matching shapes metabolism and healthy ageing Nature. 2016; 535 :561-565 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used. All mice were maintained on a 12h light/12h darkness schedule. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility at Fundación CNIC. Chow and water were available ad libitum . Experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the CNIC and local authorities.
Recipient WT RED (CD45.2) or BL/6.SJL C57 (CD45.1) mice were lethally irradiated (6.5 Gy split doses, 3 h apart), and subsequently received BL/6.SJL C57 (CD45.1) or BL/6 NZB (CD45.2) bone marrow donor cells, respectively. Donor BM cells were harvested by flushing both femora into RPMI and one million were intravenously injected into irradiated recipients.
To generate parabiotic pairs, we followed our previously described procedures ( A-Gonzalez et al., 2017 1. A-Gonzalez, N. ∙ Quintana, J.A. ∙ García-Silva, S. ... Phagocytosis imprints heterogeneity in tissue-resident macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :1281-1296 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Anesthetized mice were shaved at the corresponding lateral aspects and matching skin incisions were made from the olecranon to the knee joint of each mouse, and the subcutaneous fascia was bluntly dissected to create about 0.5 cm of free skin. The olecranon and knee joints were attached by a single 5-0 polypropylene suture and tie, and the dorsal and ventral skins were approximated by continuous suture. A single dose of flunixin meglumine (Schering-Plough, Segre, France) was injected subcutaneously in each partner at the end of the surgical procedure (1 mg/kg). One month after surgery blood samples were obtained from each of the partners to assess leukocyte chimerism.
Myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of Atropine, Xylazine and Ketamine and intubated prior to surgery. In order to get access to the heart, a small skin incision was made in the chest, followed by removal of muscle layers at the level of the third rib. The rib was sectioned and a small orifice was done in the chest, and a knot was made in the LAD coronary artery level using a 8-0 polypropylene suture. For exopher quantification in Card RED mice, LAD was maintained for 7 days without allowing reperfusion. In the case of survival experiments in CD169 DTR , LAD was maintained for 45 minutes with mice anesthetized and the knot was removed afterward. Finally, the incision was closed with 6-0 sutures. After the surgery, a single dose of flunixin meglumine (Schering-Plough, Segre, France) was injected subcutaneously and animals were kept in a 37°C chamber for the next 24 hours. At day 7 after surgery, animals were sacrificed and cardiac tissue collected.
Ventricular catheterization was performed as previously described ( Pacher et al., 2008 44. Pacher, P. ∙ Nagayama, T. ∙ Mukhopadhyay, P. ... Measurement of cardiac function using pressure-volume conductance catheter technique in mice and rats Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3 :1422-1434 Crossref Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg) and intubated. A skin incision was made to visualize the diaphragm, which was heat cauterized to expose the heart apex. The pericardium was removed gently with forceps. Using a 25–30 gauge needle, a stab wound was made near the heart apex into the left ventricle (LV). The catheter tip (Transonic, NY, USA) was inserted retrogradely into the LV. After allowing the signal to stabilize for 5 min, recordings were made of baseline left ventricular end-systolic pressure (LVESP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximal derivative of LV pressure (dP/dtmax) and minimal derivative of LV pressure (dP/dtmin). The same parameters were recorded 5 minutes after the injection a single dose of isoproterenol (40ng/kg) through the femoral vein when signal was stable. At the conclusion of the experiment, the catheter was removed by gently pulling it back through the stab wound, and the animal was euthanized.
Depletion of cMacs in either CD169 DTR or αMHC Cre ; Rosa26 Tdtom ; CD169 DTR mice was performed by intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg/kg diphtheria toxin (DT; Sigma). A single injection was administered at the indicated times for transient depletion, or three times a week for long-term (21d) depletion. In these experiments, control wild-type or αMHC Cre ; Rosa26 Tdtomato ; CD169 WT mice were treated with same doses of DT as the CD169 DTR mice. Where indicated, CD169 DTR mice treated with saline were used as controls. In control experiments we found that cMacs are the only cardiac cells targeted by, and depleted in the CD169 DTR model (not shown) and that depletion of these cells, while depleting macrophages from other organs ( Casanova-Acebes et al., 2018 10. Casanova-Acebes, M. ∙ Nicolás-Ávila, J.A. ∙ Li, J.L. ... Neutrophils instruct homeostatic and pathological states in naive tissues J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :2778-2795 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ), does not cause systemic or local inflammation ( Table S1 ).
We use several Inducible Cre strains. Fluorescent protein expression in endothelial cells was induced in Cdh5 CreERT Rosa26 Tdtom mice by intraperitoneal treatment with tamoxifen (1mg/mice) at days 11, 9 and 7 before analysis. In order to obtain mosaics of Tdtomato+ cardiomyocytes in αMHC CreERT Rosa26 Tdtom mice, we gave a single dose of tamoxifen at 1μg/mice. Finally, conditional deficiency in Atg7 on cardiomyocytes of αMHC CreERT Atg7 flox mice was induced by injecting tamoxifen (1mg/mice) for two consecutive days.
For some experiments, animals were treated trice per week with Rapamycin (4mg/kg body weight; LC Laboratories) intraperitoneally for 2 weeks and analyzed at day 14. Isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO; 25 mg/kg/day; Sigma-Aldrich) was chronically administered in mice in minipumps. Mice were anesthetized with Sevoflurane (2.5%–3.5% and 1% O 2 ) and osmotic minipumps (Mini-Osmotic Pump, Alzet) were subcutaneously implanted for continuous delivery during 7 consecutive days. Finally, for some experiments animals were administrated daily with MCC950 (intraperitoneal, 7 mg/kg/day) or ISO (subcutaneous, 50mg/kg/day) for the indicated times.
Preparation of cMacs from digested hearts was performed as indicated above. Phagocytic cMacs were identified based on the incorporation of DsRed or tdTomato fluorescence, as shown in Figures S2 B and S2C. Engulfment of material in CD45.1-WT RED bone marrow chimeras was based on acquisition of DsRed signal by CD45.1-derived cardiac macrophages in WT RED transplanted mice. Engulfment of cells in parabionts of CD45.1 with WT RED mice was based on acquisition of DsRed signal by tissue-resident macrophages in the non-fluorescent partner as previously described ( A-Gonzalez et al., 2017 1. A-Gonzalez, N. ∙ Quintana, J.A. ∙ García-Silva, S. ... Phagocytosis imprints heterogeneity in tissue-resident macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :1281-1296 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Non-parabiotic CD45.1 mice were used as controls to set the appropriate gates. Engulfment of cardiomyocyte- and endothelial cell-derived material in αMHC Cre ; Rosa26 Tdtom and Cdh5 CreERT ; Rosa26 Tdtom , respectively, was based on tdTomato signal acquisition by cMacs when comparing with non-fluorescent control mice.
AAV vectors were all produced by the triple transfection method, using HEK293A cells as described previously ( Xiao et al., 1998 59. Xiao, X. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Samulski, R.J. Production of high-titer recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors in the absence of helper adenovirus J. Virol. 1998; 72 :2224-2232 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Shuttle plasmid pAAV-mt-Keima was derived from mt-Keima-Red-Mito-7 (a gift from Michael Davidson (Addgene plasmid #56018)) and from pAcTnT (a gift from B.A. French). The mt-Keima cDNA is a fusion of Keima gene in-frame to the matrix import sequence of human Cox8A: MSVLTPLLLRGLTGSARRLPVPRAKIHSLPPEGKLGM. The expression is driven by the cardiac-specific promoter TnT (see Figure S3 B).Virus were packaged into AAV-9 capsids by the CNIC Viral Vector Unit using helper plasmids pAdDF6 (providing the three adenoviral helper genes) and pAAV2/9 (providing rep and cap viral genes). Four- to 6-week-old mice were injected with 3-10 × 10 10 viral genomes encoding mt-Keima and analyzed 2 to 6 weeks later. We confirmed no expression of mt-keima in cMac isolated from AVV9-mt-keima infected mice ( Figure S3 C). To control for no leaky expression of Tnnt2-mt-Keima in macrophages, we transfected the RAW264.7 macrophage or HL1 cardiomyocytic cell lines with a Tnnt2- mt-keima (driven by the cTnT promoter) or Cmv-mt-Keima (driven by a CMV promoter) constructs, plus a transfection control (cmv-GFP). RAW264.7 failed to express mt-Keima under the TnnT2, but not the CVM promoter, whereas HL1 cells expressed both (data not shown).
BL/6.SJL C57 mice (with C57BL/6 nuclear and C57 mitochondrial DNA) were lethally irradiated and transplanted with BL/6 NZB bone marrow (C57BL/6 nuclear and NZB mitochondrial DNA), as described above. Differential expression of the CD45.1/CD45.2 surface marker on these strains additionally allowed cytometric discrimination and sorting. Macrophages from CD45.2+ BL/6 NZB donors were isolated from different tissues by cytometric sorting and DNA isolated using NaOH 50mM at 95°C, and neutralization with TrisHCl pH 7.5. A polymorphic G4276A nucleotide in the mitochondrial ND2 gene was used to discriminate the mtDNA source in the samples. This polymorphism in C57 mtDNA forms part of a BamHI restriction site, which is absent in NZB mtDNA ( Latorre-Pellicer et al., 2016 30. Latorre-Pellicer, A. ∙ Moreno-Loshuertos, R. ∙ Lechuga-Vieco, A.V. ... Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA matching shapes metabolism and healthy ageing Nature. 2016; 535 :561-565 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total genomic DNA was PCR amplified using standard conditions with the REDExtract-N-Amp™ PCR ReadyMix™ and the primers used were Fw(5′ > 3′)AAGCTATCGGGCCCATACCCCG; Rv(5′ > 3′)GTTGAGTAGAGTGAGGGATGGG. An aliquot of PCR was digested with FastDigest BamHI (New England Biolabs), at 37°C for 10-15 minutes. After agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA was visualized with a Gel Doc XR+System (Bio-Rad), and band intensities were quantified with Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software. The proportion of C57 mtDNA was calculated by adding the intensities of the 414bp and 250bp BamHI fragments and dividing by the sum of the intensities of all fragments (undigested 664bp fragment from NZB mtDNA, and the 414bp and 250bp BamHI-digested fragments from C57mtDNA).
We sorted cMacs from mt-Keima-infected hearts or from BL/6 NZB -transplanted BL/6.SJL C57 and cultured a maximum of 3x10 5 cardiac macrophages per well in 48w plates. We used a medium with αMEM containing Na-Pyruvate, L-Glutamine and Penicillin/Streptomycin, plus Essential aminoacids, including 10% FBS and 10 ng/mL M-CSF. Macrophages were cultured for 72h at 37C°, 5% CO2.
The large intestine (colon) was cut into small pieces and subjected to epithelial separation by incubation with HBSS with 2mM of EDTA for 20 min at 37°C and subsequently digested in HBSS with liberase (1U/ml, Roche) and DNase I (10 mU/ml, Sigma) for 40 min at 37°C. Bone marrow was flushed and hearts, skeletal muscle, livers, and spleens were minced and digested in HBSS with liberase (1U/ml, Roche) and DNase I (10 mU/ml, Sigma) for 30min at 37°C. After digestion, single-cell suspensions were obtained by gentle pipetting and mechanical dissociation of the remaining pieces through cell strainers (BD Falcon). Single-cell suspensions were incubated with conjugated antibodies against CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD45.1 (clone A20), CD45.2 (clone 104), CD11b (clone M1/70), F4/80 (clone BM8), MHCII (clone M5/114.15.2), Ly6C (clone HK1.4), CD115 (clone AFS98) and Gr1 (RB6-8C5) for 15 min at 4°C (see Key Resources Table for further information). Samples were acquired in a LSRII Fortessa (BD Biosciences) or Canto HTS (BD) equipped with DIVA software (BD). The FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR) was used to analyze the data.
Truecount beads (BD) were prepared at a concentration of 10,000 beads per ml in a buffer containing EDTA 0.5M, FBS 0.5% (PEB) and 0.1 μg/mL DAPI (Life Technologies) in PBS. 500 μL of this PEB/DAPI buffer containing beads were added to single cell suspensions stained for flow cytometry as indicated above. To estimate the absolute number of cells, 500-1000 beads were acquired per tube in order to ensure accuracy. Cell counts per mg of tissue were calculated as follows: 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 1 0 , 0 0 0 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑙 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝐵 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑥 0 , 5 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑙 𝑃 ⁢ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝐵 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑥 1 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑡 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑔 ) = 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑔 For blood, absolute cell numbers given as cells per ml were obtained using an automated hemocounter (Abacus Junior, Diatron; Holliston, USA).
The heart of Card RED mice was cut into small pieces and subsequently digested in HBSS with liberase (1U/ml, Roche) and DNase I (10 mU/ml, Sigma) for 40 min at 37°C. After digestion, single-cell suspensions were obtained by gentle pipetting. We used a strategy of serial centrifugation forces (see Figure S2 K) at 50 g and 300 g discarding pellet and keeping supernatant for a final centrifugation at 1000 g. Within the pellet of this fraction, we used the endogenous expression of tdTomato along with size, antibody (CD31-Bv605; clone 390 Biolegend) and Draq5 staining (Biolegend) to define cardiac exophers. The material was sorted in an Aria Cell Sorter (BD) equipped with DIVA software (BD). In some experiments, exophers were stained for Mitotracker Deep Red (ThermoFisher), MitoNIR (Abcam). This protocol is an adaptation of previously described protocols to obtain samples enriched in apoptotic bodies ( Atkin-Smith et al., 2017 3. Atkin-Smith, G.K. ∙ Paone, S. ∙ Zanker, D.J. ... Isolation of cell type-specific apoptotic bodies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :39846 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Part of the material obtained in each fraction was subjected to cytospin in a Shandon Cytospin 4 Cytocentrifuge (ThermoFisher) at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at medium velocity. Cells and exophers were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, permeabilised with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 minutes and blocked 1 hour with 10% BSA and 2% goat serum. For immunofluorescence analysis, samples were incubated with rabbit anti-RFP (polyclonal; Rockland), washed thrice in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (Goat anti-Rabbit AF546; Molecular Probes).
Oligomycin (10 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to promote mitochondrial hyperpolarization (ATP synthase inhibition). Carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 1uM) uncouples oxygen consumption, collapses the proton gradient and ablates the mitochondrial membrane potential. Total cardiac leukocyte fraction and cardiac purified exopheres were treated for 3 hours at 37°C. Inmortalized mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs) were used as internal control to assess treatment responsiveness. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by using the fluorescent probe MitoNIR (Abcam) by flow cytometry as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated in culture medium supplemented with 1x MitoNIR for 20 minutes at 37°C. Data acquisition was performed using the FACSCanto II system (BD Biosciences). All experiments were performed in triplicates. Samples were analyzed with the BD FACSDiva™ software package and the average of the medians and corresponding standard deviations were calculated using the FlowJo software (v10).
4 week-old heterozygous CX3CR1 GFP mice were euthanized and immediately transcardially perfused with 10ml PBS containing 2mM EDTA pH7.4, followed by 10ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) through the left ventricle. The heart was dissected and fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma) overnight at 4°C, followed by extensive washing with PBS. The fixed hearts were permeabilised with graded methanol solutions from 50%, 70%, 95% and 100%, each incubated for 45minutes, followed by 100% methanol/20%DMSO for 1 hour. Tissue was rehydrated back to PBS with 45 minute incubation at room temperature. Permeabilised sample was blocked overnight in blocking buffer (2.5% goat serum, 2.5% donkey serum, 5% BSA, 0.02% gelatin, 20%DMSO, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS), washed extensively with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies in dilution buffer (2.5% goat serum, 2.5% donkey serum, 0.2% BSA, 0.02% gelatin, 5%DMSO, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 48 hours. Chicken anti-GFP (1:300 dilution, Abcam polyclonal) and Armenian hamster anti-CD31 antibodies (1:300 dilution; clone 2H8, Merck) were used. Samples were washed 6 times with 3M NaCl+0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, and twice with PBS. Each wash was for 30minutes at room temperature. Tissues were incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-chicken Alexa fluor-647, anti-hamster Alexa fluor-750; Abcam) at 1:300 in dilution buffer for 48 hours, washed as indicated above and taken for tissue clearing. All antibody incubations were carried out at 37°C. Heart tissue was cleared using the BABB (Benzyl alcohol/ Benzyl benzoate) protocol. Samples were dehydrated with methanol as for permeabilization, equilibrated with BABB:methanol in a 1:1 ratio for 45 minutes and the refractive index matched with BABB (1:2) for 45 minutes until clear. Cleared hearts were imaged using the light sheet Ultramicroscope (LaVision BioTec GmbH, Bielefeld, Germany) in BABB with a 2X objective, NA 0.5, using a white light supercontinuum laser. Post-acquisition, high resolution raw data was downsampled and corrected to remove high intensity artifacts arising from uneven light illumination during acquisition, using Imaris 8.0 (Bitplane AG). Image contrast was further improved using the unsharp mask function of FIJI Is Just ImageJ (NIH), and rendered in 3D using Imaris 8.0. Macrophage number in the whole organ was quantified using GFP signal in Cx3cr1 GFP mice for segmentation with surface tool in Imaris 8.0.
Mice were sacrificed with CO 2 and perfused with a saline solution in order to collect the hearts into a 2% PFA solution. Human samples for immunofluorescence fixed in PFA 2% were obtained as indicated above. After 24 hours in fixation solution at 4°C, samples were cryopreserved with a sucrose gradient, and frozen in OCT Compound (Tissue Tek) using dry ice. Tissues were cut in 12 μm (most of them) or 30 μm (for 3D reconstructions) sections in a cryostat (Leica CM1850). Macrophage detection by immunofluorescence was carried out in cardiac slices permeabilised with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 minutes and blocked 1 hour with 10% BSA and 2% goat serum. For immunofluorescence, mouse tissues were incubated with rat anti-CD68 (clone FA-11; BioRad), rat anti-CD169 (clone 3D6; kindly provided by S.Gordon), rabbit anti-laminin (polyclonal; Sigma), rabbit anti-NDUFS2 (Polyclonal Abcam), rabbit anti-Cytochrome C (clone EPR1327; Abcam), rabbit anti-Tom20 (clone FL-145; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Myh7 (clone NOQ7.5.4D; Sigma), rabbit anti-Optineurin (clone EPR20654 Abcam), rabbit anti-PEX14 (polyclonal Proteintech), rabitt anti-GM130 (clone EP892Y Abcam), mouse anti-keima (clone 1C3 MBL), chicken anti-GFP (polyclonal invitrogen) or rabbit anti-LAMP1 (polyclonal; Sigma) primary antibodies. Humans samples were incubated with mouse antibodies anti-CD68 (clone PG-M1; Dako), mouse anti-MYH (clone MF20; DSHB) or rabbit anti-Tom20 (clone FL-145; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Tissues were washed thrice in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) or Phalloidin-AF647 (Thermofisher). All staining steps were conducted in blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, tissues were washed in PBS and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Life Technologies) before mounting with Mowiol 4–88 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Hearts from heterozygous CX3CR1 GFP mice were collected in excision buffer (HBSS 1x, FBS 5% at pH7.4) and manually cut perpendicular to the ventricular walls to form 1-2 mm thick rings of tissue. Those slices were incubated with Annexin V-PE (BD Biosciences) in Annexin binding buffer (10mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4; 140 mM NaCl; 2,5 mM CaCl2) with or without EDTA 1mM as control, since Annexin-V binding to PS is calcium dependent. For imaging, slices were placed into glass Petri plates containing fresh Annexin binding buffer and immobilized with a coverslip. Images were taken in an SP5 microscope (Leica) maintaining 37°C and 5% O2 levels. Tissue borders were avoided to exclude areas of dead cardiomyocytes. We measured the distances between macrophages and phosphatidylserine (Annexin V+) patches using FIJI Is Just ImageJ (NIH), and compared them to the same number of random spots in those images. Random spots were 1 μm diameter circles (similar to the phosphatidylserine patches) generated by a macro using FIJI Is Just ImageJ (NIH). For FACS, we incubated exophers preparations from Card RED mice (as in Figure S2 K) with Annexin V-APC (BD Biosciences) in Annexin binding buffer for 15 minutes before analysis.
Cardiac macrophages were isolated from hearts of DsRed transgenic mice by FACS sorting using an Aria Cell Sorter (BD) equipped with DIVA software (BD). We co-cultured these DsRed+ macrophages with HL1 GFP cells for 18 hours in an 8-well IBIDI plate and performed imaging for 2 hours in a Nikon Time Lapse microscope at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . After imaging, cells were fixed with PFA 2% for 15 min for immunostaining with Rabbit anti-Tom20 antibody (clone FL-145; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Secondary Goat Anti-Rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes).
For TEM analysis of WT, CD169 DTR and Mertk −/− mice or human samples, heart pieces were first fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA in PBS, overnight at 4°C. Samples were post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 60 minutes and dehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions (30%, 50%, 70%, 95%, and 100%) and acetone. After the last dehydration step, samples were incubated in a 1:3, 1:1, 3:1 mixture of Durcupan resin and acetone and cured at 60° for 48h. Ultrathin sections (50-60 nm) were obtained using a diamond knife (Diatome) in an ultramicrotome (Leica Reichert ultracut S) and collected in 200-mesh copper grids. The sections were counterstained with 2% uranyl acetate in water from 20 min followed by a lead citrate solution. Samples were examined with a JEOL JEM1010 electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Orius SC200 digital camera (Gatan Inc.) at the Transmission Electron Microscopy Laboratory (Interdepartmental Research Service, UAM). For images of isoproterenol-treated mice, tissue samples were processed as previously described ( Latorre-Pellicer et al., 2016 30. Latorre-Pellicer, A. ∙ Moreno-Loshuertos, R. ∙ Lechuga-Vieco, A.V. ... Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA matching shapes metabolism and healthy ageing Nature. 2016; 535 :561-565 Crossref Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Echocardiography assessment was blinded and performed by an expert operator in mice under isoflurane anesthesia using a high-frequency ultrasound system with a 30-MHz linear probe (Vevo 2100, Visualsonics Inc., Canada). A base apex electrocardiogram was continuously monitored through 4 leads connected to the ultrasound machine and isoflurane delivery was adjusted to maintain the heart rate in 450 ± 50 bpm. Normothermia was maintained placing mice in a heating platform. Images were recorded and transferred to a computer for posterior blinded analysis using the Vevo 2100 Workstation software. Parasternal standard 2D and MM long axis view were acquired to assess left ventricle (LV) systolic function and LV dimensions. LV ejection fraction (LV-EF), end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volume (LV-Vol,d and LV-Vol,s; respectively) and Cardiac Output were subsequently calculated. A 2D apical view was used to evaluate diastolic dysfunction, using pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler, to estimate mitral valve inflow pattern. Early and late diastolic velocity peak waves (E and A, respectively) were measured and the E/A ratio calculated.
Quantification and localization of cardiac exophers relative to CD68, CytC, Ndufs2, Tom20, MYH7 and DAPI was done manually, as the Tomato signal from Card RED cardiomyocytes did not allow segmentation. The criteria for co-localization was overlapping positions of tdTomato signal in exophers of αMHC Cre ; Rosa26 Tdtom mice and the stained markers, while the percentage of co-localization between cardiac exophers and any other “marker” was quantified as follows: % o f e x o p h e r s c o − l o c a l i z i n g w i t h ″ m a r k e r ″ = N . o f e x o p h e r e s c o l o c a l i z i n g w i t h ″ m a r k e r ″ 𝑥 1 0 0 N . o f t o t a l e x o p h e r e s We measured the distances between macrophages and cardiac exophers using FIJI and ImageJ softwares (NIH), and compared these distances to the same number of random spots in those images. Random spots were 3.5 μm diameter circles (similar to cardiac exophers) generated by a macro using FIJI Is Just ImageJ (NIH).
We measured the 3D features of cardiac exophers and cardiac macrophages using Imaris Software (Bitplane AG, Switzerland). For 3D reconstructions, we used 0.25 μm detail level and a threshold based on absolute intensity. The source channels for the reconstruction of cardiac exopheres and cardiac macrophages were tdTomato in αMHC Cre Rosa26 Tdtom mice and CD68-FITC, respectively. From the parameters provided by the ImarisCell module we selected Volume, Area and Sphericity. In the case of cardiac exophers, diameter was calculated from Volume considering them as perfect spheres due to their high Sphericity index (0.71 ± 0.01 in exophers versus 0.37 ± 0.01 in cMacs).
The cMac to cardiomyocytes ratios were analyzed in CX3CR1 GFP/+ mice. Hearts from these mice were fixed and frozen as described in the immunostaining method. We obtained thick slices (60 μm) from OCT-included samples using a cryostat and subjected them to permeabilization (in PBS + Triton 0.1% solution), blocking (10% BSA, 5% NGS in PBS) and staining steps, all of them performed overnight at 4°C. We stained the samples with primary rabbit anti-laminin (polyclonal; Sigma) and secondary goat anti-rabbit AF546 antibodies to label the cardiomyocyte basal lamina. We performed quantification of cMacs and cardiomyocytes spatial interactions in 30 μm thick optic fields obtained using an SPE microscope (Leica). For the visualization of individual cardiomyocytes we used tissues of αMHC CreERT ; Rosa26 Tdtom mice. Cardiac tissue was fixed in a 2% PFA solution. After 24 hours in fixation solution at 4°C, samples were incubated thrice with washing buffer (0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS) for one hour each and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS overnight. For immunofluorescence, mouse tissues were incubated with rat anti-CD68 (clone FA-11; BioRad) and rabbit anti-RFP (polyclonal; Rockland) primary antibodies and goat secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). After immunostaining, tissues were washed thrice with washing buffer (0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS) for one hour each and dehydrated with an ethanol gradient (50%/70%/100% twice) before inclusion in clearing solution (Ethyl cinnamate; Sigma). A large portion of the tissue was imaged using a SP8 microscope (Leica) equipped with a resonant scanner, and then reconstructed using Imaris 8.0 (Bitplane AG).
Keima is a fluorescent protein resistant to lysosomal proteases, with an emission spectrum that peaks at 620 nm and a bimodal excitation spectrum peaking at 440 and 586 nm corresponding to the neutral and ionized states of the chromophore’s phenolic hydroxyl moiety, respectively ( Violot et al., 2009 56. Violot, S. ∙ Carpentier, P. ∙ Blanchoin, L. ... Reverse pH-dependence of chromophore protonation explains the large Stokes shift of the red fluorescent protein mKeima J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131 :10356-10357 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neutral and ionized states predominate at high and low pH, respectively, thus allowing measurement of mitophagy in vitro and in vivo ( Katayama et al., 2011 27. Katayama, H. ∙ Kogure, T. ∙ Mizushima, N. ... A sensitive and quantitative technique for detecting autophagic events based on lysosomal delivery Chem. Biol. 2011; 18 :1042-1052 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sun et al., 2015 52. Sun, N. ∙ Yun, J. ∙ Liu, J. ... Measuring In Vivo Mitophagy Mol. Cell. 2015; 60 :685-696 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used this property to evaluate mitochondria degradation in macrophages by measuring ratiometric “red-to-green” fluorescence intensities in Keima+ regions co-localizing with macrophages (CD68+) or cardiomyocytes. Imaging was done using an SP5 confocal microscope (Leica) in two channels via two sequential excitations (458 nm for “green”; and 561 nm for “red” excitation), and a 590–650 nm emission filter in both cases. Laser power was set at the lowest output that would allow clear visualization of the mt-Keima signal. CD68 labeling (for macrophages) was detected using a 488 nm excitation and a 510–550 nm emission filter.
Cardiomyocytes area, perimeter and shape descriptors where measured by manually definition of cardiomyocytes borders in images from cardiac sections (using laminin staining) and isolated cardiomyocytes (bright field) using ImageJ. Sarcomere length and mitochondria size and shape were obtained by visual inspection and segmentation of these structures in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, using ImageJ.
Cardiac macrophages were isolated by FACS and subjected to cytospin in a Shandon Cytospin 4 Cytocentrifuge (ThermoFisher) at 800 rpm for 5 minutes, at medium velocity. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, stained in eosin for 5 min, washed in dH 2 O, stained in hematoxilin for 5 min, and finally washed and mounted with dH 2 O.
Mitochondria were isolated from mouse heart and liver samples as described ( Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013 29. Lapuente-Brun, E. ∙ Moreno-Loshuertos, R. ∙ Aciń-Pérez, R. ... Supercomplex assembly determines electron flux in the mitochondrial electron transport chain Science. 2013; 340 :1567-1570 Crossref Scopus (628) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ATP synthesis was measured by kinetic luminescence assay ( Vives-Bauza et al., 2007 57. Vives-Bauza, C. ∙ Yang, L. ∙ Manfredi, G. Assay of mitochondrial ATP synthesis in animal cells and tissues Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80 :155-171 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mitochondria were resuspended in 160 μL buffer A (150mM KCl, 25mM Tris-HCl, 2mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA FA, 10mM K-phosphate and 0.1mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.4) at room temperature and dispensed into the wells of a 96-well luminescence reading plate (Costar). Substrate cocktail and buffer B (0.5M Tris-acetate pH 7.75, 0.8mM luciferine, 20 μg/ml luciferase) were added, and luminescence was measured over 1 min. Substrate cocktails were composed of 6 mM diadenosin pentaphosphate and 6 mM ADP supplemented with glutamate + malate for determination of CI activity, or with succinate for CII activity or palmitate + carnitine for assessment of fatty acid oxidation. The ATP production rates were normalize to citrate synthase activity (see below) and expressed as the amount of ATP produced (nmol / min / mg of protein) relative to controls. Technical duplicates were performed and the average value for each animal was represented. Cytrate synthase activity was determined spectrophotometrically as described ( Birch-Machin and Turnbull, 2001 6. Birch-Machin, M.A. ∙ Turnbull, D.M. Assaying mitochondrial respiratory complex activity in mitochondria isolated from human cells and tissues Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65 :97-117 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). 3–10 μg of total protein from tissue homogenates or isolated exophers were used for the assay. Investigators were not blinded to the group allocation.
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane during the whole acquisition. Spectroscopy examinations were performed in vivo on a 7T preclinical system (Agilent Varian, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with a DD2 console and an active shielded 115/60 gradient insert coil with 433 mT/m maximum strength. Double-tuned circular transmit/receive coil were used for phosphorus/proton (20 mm), placed over cardiac muscle (Rapid Biomedical GmBH, Rimpar Germany). Proton tissue spectra were acquired by 128 transients with 2048 complex points with a spectral bandwidth of 10 kHz and a repetition time of 1.2 ms. Phosphorus tissue spectra were acquired by 1000 transients with 8192 complex points with a spectral bandwidth of 7 kHz and a repetition time of 800ms. Spectra were acquired with adiabatic radiofrequency pulses to improve sensitivity and minimize spectral distortions with an Ernst flip angle. Chemical shift were expressed relative to phosphocreatine (0 ppm). Signals in nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were determined quantitatively by integration after automatic or manual baseline correction, with fitting of each peak of the spectrum (after phase and baseline correction) to a Lorentzian function using the Mestrenova program (Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Compostela, Spain; released 2015-02-04 version:10.0.1-14719). An exponential line broadening (3 Hz for proton) was applied before Fourier transformation.
All acquisitions were performed with a small-animal PET/CT scanner (nanoScan, Mediso). PET studies were acquired 30 minutes after intravenous administration of 17 MBq of 18 F-FDG. During FDG uptake, the animals were kept awake and warm to prevent brown fat uptake. PET data were then collected for 30 minutes with the mice anesthetized using 1.5% sevoflurane in oxygen at 3 L/min and reconstructed using Tera-Tomo 3D with 6 subsets, 4 iterations, an energy window of 400-600 keV and a coincidence mode of 1-5. The voxel size of the reconstructed images was 0.399 mm in the transaxial plane and 0.399 mm in the axial plane. After the PET scan, a helicoidal CT study was acquired using an X-ray beam exposure of 89 μAs and a tube voltage of 45 kVp and reconstructed using a Ramlack algorithm. These CT scans were used as anatomical templates. PET values were measured as standardized uptake value (SUV) over the segmented region corresponding to the left ventricle. On the PET images, the regions of interest were delimited over the whole hearts to measure their corresponding SUV (SUV mean).
Animals were euthanized and the heart was quickly removed, cannulated through the ascending aorta, and mounted on a Langendorff perfusion apparatus. The heart was then retrogradely perfused for 4 min at room temperature (RT) with pre-filtered Ca 2+ -free Perfusion-Buffer [NaCl (113 mmol/L); KCl (4.7 mmol/L); KH2PO4 (0.6 mmol/L); Na2HPO4 (0.6 mmol/L); MgSO4·7H2O (1.2 mmol/L); NaHCO3 (12 mmol/L); KHCO3 (10 mmol/L); HEPES (10 mmol/L); taurine (30 mmol/L); glucose (5.5 mmol/L); 2,3-butanedione-monoxime (10 mmol/L), pH 7.4]. Enzymatic digestion was performed with digestion-buffer consisting in perfusion-buffer with Liberase (0.2 mg/mL), Trypsin 2.5% (0,14 mg/mL); CaCl2 (12.5 μmol/L) and Phenol Red (0.032 mmol/L)] for 20 min at 37°C. At the end of enzymatic digestion, both ventricles were isolated and gently disaggregated in 5 mL of Digestion Buffer. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 100-μm sterile mesh (SEFAR-Nitex) and transferred for enzymatic inactivation to a tube with 10 mL of stopping-buffer-1, which consisted in perfusion-buffer supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10% v/v) and CaCl2 (12.5 μmol/L). After gravity sedimentation for 15 min, cardiomyocytes were resuspended in stopping-buffer-2 containing 5% FBS (v/v) for 10 min. Cardiomyocyte Ca 2+ -reintroduction was performed in stopping-buffer-2 with two progressively increased CaCl 2 concentrations (112 μmol/L and 1 mmol/L). Cells were resuspended and allowed to decant for 10 min in each step, allowing purification of the cardiomyocyte suspension. Homogeneous suspension of rod-shaped cardiomyocytes was then resuspended in M199 supplemented with l-glutamine, pyruvate, penicillin–streptomycin (1%), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 2 g/L), blebbistatin (25 μmol/L) and FBS (5%). Cells were plated in single drops onto 20-mm 2 glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek) precoated with 100 μL of mouse laminin (200 μg/mL) in 900 μL NaCl 0.9% for at least 1 h. For each mouse, 2 dishes were used as a control culture and 2 dishes were treated with Hydroxycloroquine (30 μM) for 12h to block lysosomal degradation. After culture, cardiomyocytes were fixed overnight at 4°C in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, immunofluorescence was made following standard procedures: fixation in methanol at 4°C for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and blocked in PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Anti-LC3 antibody (clone 5F10 Nanotools) primary antibody was used and Nuclei were co-stained with DAPI. Isolated cardiomyocytes were then imaged with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using 20 × /0.75 dry and 63 × /1.30 oil objectives. Quantifications were made by using the macro plugin tool in ImageJ, which automatically detected individual cardiomyocytes and quantified the number of LC3, dots per cell. Autophagy was determined by evaluating autophagic flux that is achieved by comparing the number of LC3-positive autophagosomes in the absence and presence of lysosomal inhibitors like hydroxychloroquine.
Total heart protein homogenates were separated by 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electro blotted onto PVDF transfer membrane (BioRad). For protein detection, the following antibodies were used: NLRP3 (clone 25N10E9; ThermoFisher), Caspase-1 (clone 14F468; Santa Cruz), LC3 (Polyclonal; Cell Signal) and p62 (polyclonal; Cell Signal). Western blot images were quantified by using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) and Ponceau S staining was selected as a loading control.
Blood was collected using EDTA tubes and then centrifuged 15 minutes at 4°C at 2000 x g to isolate plasma. The biochemical profile was assessed with a Dimension RxL Max®automated analyzer. All reagents used for the analyses in Figure S6 E and Table S1 were purchased from Siemens.
For proteomic studies in wild-type and CD169 DTR mice after depletion, hearts were collected from PBS perfused animals and frozen in liquid nitrogen.Protein extracts were obtained by tissue homogenization with ceramic beads (MagNa Lyser Green Beads, Roche, Germany) in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, pH 8.5 – 8.8, 50 mM DTT). The protein extract for each time-point from three biological replicates, and an internal standard generated as a pool of peptides from all biological conditions, were subjected to tryptic digestion and the resulting peptides were labeled with 10-plex isobaric mass tags for relative quantification (TMT, Thermo Scientific). Labeled peptides were subjected to peptide separation into different fractions using a Waters Oasis MCX cartridge (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) or high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fractionated peptides were then analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Termo Scientific). Protein identification was performed using the SEQUEST HT algorithm integrated in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific). MS/MS scans were searched against a mouse reference proteome database (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 02_12_2015). Peptides were identified from MS/MS data using the probability ratio method ( Martínez-Bartolomé et al., 2008 35. Martínez-Bartolomé, S. ∙ Navarro, P. ∙ Martín-Maroto, F. ... Properties of average score distributions of SEQUEST: the probability ratio method Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7 :1135-1145 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the False discovery rate (FDR) of peptide identifications was calculated by the refined method ( Bonzon-Kulichenko et al., 2015 8. Bonzon-Kulichenko, E. ∙ Garcia-Marques, F. ∙ Trevisan-Herraz, M. ... Revisiting peptide identification by high-accuracy mass spectrometry: problems associated with the use of narrow mass precursor windows J. Proteome Res. 2015; 14 :700-710 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quantitative information was extracted from the MS/MS spectra of TMT-labeled peptides using a SQL query from the Thermo Proteome Discoverer file (.msf). Protein abundance changes were expressed as log2-ratios in standardized units 𝑧 𝑞 ( Navarro et al., 2014 41. Navarro, P. ∙ Trevisan-Herraz, M. ∙ Bonzon-Kulichenko, E. ... General statistical framework for quantitative proteomics by stable isotope labeling J. Proteome Res. 2014; 13 :1234-1247 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Significant protein abundance changes for the indicated contrasts were defined by applying Student’s t test to 𝑧 𝑞 data, and differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. The differentially expressed proteins were then analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Quiagen, https://www.ingenuity.com ). Pathways with adjusted p values below 0.05 were considered overrepresented and shown as Bubble plots.
We used hearts form Card RED mice and exophers isolated from the same mice as indicated in Figure S2 K and the Methods section. Mice were perfused with PBS and approximately 50 mg of tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen from each heart, while the rest was used to isolate the corresponding exospheres. The protein extracts were obtained in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, pH 8.5 – 8.8, 50 mM DTT) by tissue homogenization with ceramic beads (MagNa Lyser Green Beads, Roche, Germany) for total hearts and by heating (5 min at 90°C), vortexing and centrifugation (10 min at 16100 g) for cardiac exophers. Protein lysates from the exospheres and the corresponding heart tissue were boiled in 2x Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to in-gel digestion ( Bonzon-Kulichenko et al., 2011 7. Bonzon-Kulichenko, E. ∙ Pérez-Hernández, D. ∙ Núñez, E. ... A robust method for quantitative high-throughput analysis of proteomes by 18O labeling Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 :003335 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ) and analyzed using a Proxeon Easy nano-flow HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled via a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). C18-based reverse phase separation was used with a 2-cm trap column and a 50-cm analytical column (75 μm I.D, 2 μm particle size, Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 100 C18; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a continuous acetonitrile gradient consisting of 0%–30% A for 120 min, 50%–90% B for 3 min (A = 0.1% formic acid; B = 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. Mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner, with an automatic switch between MS and MS/MS using a top 15 method and dynamic exclusion. MS spectra in the Orbitrap analyzer were in a mass range of 400–1500 m/z and 120,000 resolution. HCD fragmentation was performed at 33 eV of normalized collision energy and MS/MS spectra were analyzed at 30,000 resolution in the Orbitrap. Protein identification was performed as described above (Proteome Discoverer 2.1; Thermo Scientific) and MS/MS scans were searched against a mouse reference proteome database (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot April_2018), supplemented with the tdTomato and 116 CRAP proteins (Global Proteome Machine) (16988 sequences in total). Peptide identification from MS/MS data was performed as described above. In order to obtain maximum reliability, we eliminated from the analysis all proteins that had less than 6 counts among all samples, and that were not detected at least in 3 samples of the same group (either total cardiac tissue or exophers). Data in each sample was normalized by the total number of spectral countsand represented as scaled abundance for each protein, defined as follows: P r o t e i n ″ 𝑋 ″ i n s a m p l e E n = C o u n t s o f p r o t e i n ″ 𝑋 ″ i n s a m p l e E n A v e r a g e o f c o u n t s f o r p r o t e i n ″ 𝑋 ″ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑛 Where En is Exopher sample “n” and Hn is Heart sample from which the same exophers were obtained. We only considered proteins with adjusted p values below 0.05 as significantly changed between both conditions, as shown in Figure S2 M.
Total RNA was prepared with RNA Extraction RNeasy Plus Micro-kit (QIAGEN) for isolation from macrophages or with TRIzol (Sigma) for total tissue RNA. RNA was reverse-transcribed with High- Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems; Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time quantitative PCR (SYBR-green, Applied Biosystems) assays were performed with an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System sequencer detector. Expression was normalized to expression of the 36b4 housekeeping gene. Primer sequences were: 36b4: Fw(5′ > 3′)ACTGGTCTAGGACCCGAGAAG; Rv(5′ > 3′) TCCCACCTTGTCTCCAGTCT Keima: Fw(5′ > 3′)AGCTTCAGTACGGAAGCATACC; Rv(5′ > 3′)TGCTCCTCTCCCATGTATATCC Tomato: Fw(5′ > 3′)GCCGACATCCCCGATTACAAGA; Rv(5′ > 3′)CGATGGTGTAGTCCTCGTTGTGG
Cx3cr1 (to identify macrophages) and Mertk gene expressions were analyzed from a single cell sequencing dataset of cardiac cells publicly available in Tabula Muris ( https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org/ ) ( Schaum et al., 2018 48. Schaum, N. ∙ Karkanias, J. ∙ Neff, N.F. ..., Tabula Muris Consortium, Overall coordination, Logistical coordination, Organ collection and processing, Library preparation and sequencing, Computational data analysis, Cell type annotation, Writing group, Supplemental text writing group, Principal investigators Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris Nature. 2018; 562 :367-372 Crossref Scopus (1503) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, the FACS-based full length transcript dataset from the heart was used, as it has higher coverage and sensitivity than its droplet based counterpart. These results are presented in Figure S7 A as obtained by using the visualization tool featured in Tabula Muris. In order to compare Mertk expression in cardiac macrophages with macrophages from other tissues, a heatmap plot was constructed using the normalized expression of relevant genes in heart, brain and spleen from the array data published by Pinto et al. (2012) 45. Pinto, A.R. ∙ Paolicelli, R. ∙ Salimova, E. ...

Data are represented as mean values ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or box and whiskers plots. Where applicable, normality was estimated using D’Agostino & Pearson or Shapiro-Wilk normality test. For comparison between 2 groups, paired or unpaired t test was used when data presented normal distribution and paired or unpaired Mann-Withney when data did not follow normal distribution. For more than 2 groups, data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s multiple comparison when data presented normal distribution and Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's multiple comparison when data did not follow normal distribution. Log-rank analysis was used for Mantel-Cox survival curves. Sample exclusion was not performed unless evident signs of disease were found in a mouse. Statistically significant outliers were identified using Grubb’s test (ESD method). All statistical analyses were performed using Prism v6 (GraphPad Software, California, USA) and specified in the legends of every Figure. A p value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant ( ∗ ). P values p ≤ 0.01 ( ∗∗ ) and p ≤ 0.001 ( ∗∗∗ ), as well as non-significant differences (n.s.) are indicated.
