Title: A Well-Mixed E. coli Genome: Widespread Contacts Revealed by Tracking Mu Transposition


Abstract: Summary

The three-dimensional structures of chromosomes are increasingly being recognized as playing a major role in cellular regulatory states. The efficiency and promiscuity of phage Mu transposition was exploited to directly measure in vivo interactions between genomic loci in E. coli . Two global organizing principles have emerged: first, the chromosome is well-mixed and uncompartmentalized, with transpositions occurring freely between all measured loci; second, several gene families/regions show “clustering”: strong three-dimensional co-localization regardless of linear genomic distance. The activities of the SMC/condensin protein MukB and nucleoid-compacting protein subunit HU-α are essential for the well-mixed state; HU-α is also needed for clustering of 6/7 ribosomal RNA-encoding loci. The data are explained by a model in which the chromosomal structure is driven by dynamic competition between DNA replication and chromosomal relaxation, providing a foundation for determining how region-specific properties contribute to both chromosomal structure and gene regulation.

Section: Introduction

The problem of compacting genomes while still performing cellular processes is common to all life forms, but the functional interplay between chromosomal structure and function remains an area of intense research. Bacterial chromosomes range anywhere from 0.5 to 8 Mb in length and are compacted nearly 1,000-fold to fit within the nucleoid ( Postow et al., 2004; Travers and Muskhelishvili, 2005; Wang and Rudner, 2014 44.

Spatial organization of bacterial chromosomes Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2014; 22 :66-72 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genomic compaction is thought to occur through the combined activity of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) and condensation through molecular crowding ( Hadizadeh Yazdi et al., 2012; Pelletier et al., 2012; Youngren et al., 2014 17.

NAPs such as H-NS, HU, Fis, and the SMC-like MukBEF complex, are capable of binding DNA to introduce bends, loops, and bridges in the chromosome ( Rybenkov et al., 2014; Badrinarayanan et al., 2015; Marbouty et al., 2015; Valens et al., 2016; Lioy et al., 2018 2.

Our current view of the genomic structure of E. coli is derived from fluorescent microscopy, site-specific recombination, and 3C/Hi-C experiments ( Niki et al., 2000; Valens et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006; Fisher et al., 2013; Schmitt et al., 2016; Lioy et al., 2018 10.

The two Escherichia coli chromosome arms locate to separate cell halves Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :1727-1731 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). The first indication of organized chromosomal regions came from fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Ori and Ter domains of E. coli ( Niki et al., 2000 39. Niki, H. ∙ Yamaichi, Y. ∙ Hiraga, S. Dynamic organization of chromosomal DNA in Escherichia coli Genes Dev. 2000; 14 :212-223 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), revealing that loci within the Ori domain are positioned at the mid cell and segregate toward the poles after replication ( Figures S1 A and S1B) ( Wang et al., 2006; Espeli et al., 2008; Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2012 9.

The two Escherichia coli chromosome arms locate to separate cell halves Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :1727-1731 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas loci located within Ter stay located at the mid cell, and after division, remain at the nascent cell poles ( Kleckner et al., 2018 23.

Microbiol. 2018; 9 :1469 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Experiments based on λ att site recombination suggested the existence of additional organization beyond Ori and Ter ( Valens et al., 2004 55. Valens, M. ∙ Penaud, S. ∙ Rossignol, M. ... Macrodomain organization of the Escherichia coli chromosome EMBO J. 2004; 23 :4330-4341 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). Relying on recombination frequencies between λ att sites placed around the chromosome, four large structured “macrodomains” (MDs) were proposed—Ori, Ter, L, and R—where there was more recombination within each domain than between them; two “non-structured” NS domains were proposed to flank Ori ( Figure S1 A). Recent advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques have also led researchers to propose the existence of chromosomal interaction domains (CIDs), which are contiguous blocks on the chromosome wherein two loci within the same CID interact more frequently than loci from different CIDs ( Cagliero et al., 2013; Le and Laub, 2016; Lioy et al., 2018 3.

Multiscale Structuring of the E. coli Chromosome by Nucleoid-Associated and Condensin Proteins Cell. 2018; 172 :771-783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). A survey of diverse bacteria showed the presence of roughly 20 CIDs across the genome of each species studied ( Marbouty et al., 2015; Val et al., 2016 33. Marbouty, M. ∙ Le Gall, A. ∙ Cattoni, D.I. ... Condensin- and Replication-Mediated Bacterial Chromosome Folding and Origin Condensation Revealed by Hi-C and Super-resolution Imaging Mol.

A checkpoint control orchestrates the replication of the two chromosomes of Vibrio cholerae Sci. Adv. 2016; 2 :e1501914 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). The boundaries of the CIDs in C. crescentus correlate with high gene expression ( Le et al., 2013 28. Le, T.B. ∙ Imakaev, M.V. ∙ Mirny, L.A. ... High-resolution mapping of the spatial organization of a bacterial chromosome Science. 2013; 342 :731-734 Crossref Scopus (420) PubMed Google Scholar ). 3C experiments have shown that many of the CIDs can coalesce to form large macrodomains ranging from 0.5 to 1.4 Mb in B. subtilis and C. crescentus ( Le et al., 2013; Le and Laub, 2016 27. Le, T.B. ∙ Laub, M.T. Transcription rate and transcript length drive formation of chromosomal interaction domain boundaries EMBO J. 2016; 35 :1582-1595 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar 28.

Every methodology has its limitations. Fluorescence techniques (FROS) are useful in locating the cellular position of genomic loci, but their sensitivity for monitoring interactions between the loci is limited ( Espeli et al., 2008 9. Espeli, O. ∙ Mercier, R. ∙ Boccard, F. DNA dynamics vary according to macrodomain topography in the E. coli chromosome Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68 :1418-1427 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). The λ recombination methodology is limited by its site-specificity in that it can only monitor artificially placed sites similar to FISH/FROS. HiC analysis of the E. coli genome observed a strong characterization of the Ter region, but not necessarily the L, R, or NS domains to the extent reported by λ recombination ( Cagliero et al., 2013; Lioy et al., 2018 3. Cagliero, C. ∙ Grand, R.S. ∙ Jones, M.B. ... Genome conformation capture reveals that the Escherichia coli chromosome is organized by replication and transcription Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :6058-6071 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Lioy, V.S. ∙ Cournac, A. ∙ Marbouty, M. ... Multiscale Structuring of the E. coli Chromosome by Nucleoid-Associated and Condensin Proteins Cell. 2018; 172 :771-783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, 3C and related approaches may be limited by the use of formaldehyde crosslinking to solidify interactions between chromosomal loci, which might alter chromosomal conformation itself.
In this study, an alternative methodology was developed and applied for probing bacterial chromosomal structure, employing the transposable phage Mu. This approach combines the utility of sampling multiple independent sites simultaneously, with high promiscuity in choosing locations, conducted entirely in vivo with no external perturbations or crosslinking agents. Mu is capable of integrating its DNA indiscriminately and with high frequency into the genome of its E. coli host ( Mizuuchi, 1992; Chaconas et al., 1996; Nakai et al., 2001; Harshey, 2014 4. Chaconas, G. ∙ Lavoie, B.D. ∙ Watson, M.A. DNA transposition: jumping gene machine, some assembly required Curr. Biol. 1996; 6 :817-820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar 18.

Mu transposes by a nick-join pathway, where single-strand cleavages generated at each end of the Mu genome (Mu ends) by the transposase MuA are joined to similar cleavages made 5 bp apart on the target DNA. The resulting branched Mu-target joint is resolved by replication through Mu during the lytic cycle, amplifying Mu copies in a process called replicative transposition ( Figure 1 A). Joining of the Mu donor and target strands is entirely dependent on MuA-mediated DNA interaction between the Mu genome and the target site, and as such is governed by physical ability of those sites to interact. MuA has a fairly degenerate 5 bp target recognition consensus of 5′-CYSRG. Target capture is aided by MuB, a non-specific DNA-binding protein and AAA + ATPase.
The work presented here follows 35 independent Mu prophages located throughout the genome through one round of transposition. The data show that in a clonal population, Mu is able to sample the entirety of the genome regardless of the starting genome location with roughly equal probability, suggesting widespread contacts between all regions of the chromosome and arguing against the strong compartmentalization that has been inferred from some (but not all) Hi-C experiments. Statistical modeling of the data reveals a distance-independent 3D co-localization of several functional gene classes. The condensin complex MukBEF and the NAP HUα were identified as being crucial for these properties. A simple polymer model was used to interpret these findings and provide a global framework for understanding the effects of NAP activity and specific contacts on the chromosomal structure of E. coli .

Section: Results and Discussion

Mu was placed at sites all around the E. coli chromosome by generating 35 prophage strains as shown in Figure 1 B, and a single round of transposition was induced in each strain (see STAR Methods and Videos S1 and S2 for details). For analysis, the genome was partitioned into 100 equally sized bins (each bin ∼46.4 kb) to monitor transposition from the starting location/bin to the 99 other bins. Given the random nature of Mu transposition, each cell in the clonal population is expected to have experienced a different transposition event. Representative insertion profiles of the first hop for nine different prophages located across the E. coli chromosome are shown in Figure 2 A. The data clearly show that, irrespective of its starting bin, Mu transposes to every bin of the genome at the resolution presented here, with roughly equal frequencies. Similar profiles were obtained for the remaining 26 prophages (data available; see STAR Methods ). Given that Mu transposition depends on contacts between transposase-bound Mu ends and MuB-bound target DNA ( Figure 1 A), these insertion profiles demonstrate that there are roughly equal physical interactions between every chromosomal region, allowing Mu to transpose globally within the nucleoid.

As reported by ParB, the phage behaves as a stable, sub-diffusive locus on the chromosome prior to induction.

Fluorescent Mu foci have doubled per cell, as expected after one round of transposition. These foci show sub-diffusive behavior even after induction of transposition.4
The data in Figure 2 A also highlight that Mu transposes freely across MD boundaries originally defined by the lack of phage λ att site recombination ( Valens et al., 2004; Espeli et al., 2008 9. Espeli, O. ∙ Mercier, R. ∙ Boccard, F. DNA dynamics vary according to macrodomain topography in the E. coli chromosome Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68 :1418-1427 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar 55. Valens, M. ∙ Penaud, S. ∙ Rossignol, M. ... Macrodomain organization of the Escherichia coli chromosome EMBO J. 2004; 23 :4330-4341 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A). An alternative set of MD boundaries were observed using high throughput 3C experiments ( Lioy et al., 2018 30. Lioy, V.S. ∙ Cournac, A. ∙ Marbouty, M. ... Multiscale Structuring of the E. coli Chromosome by Nucleoid-Associated and Condensin Proteins Cell. 2018; 172 :771-783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), although other previously reported 3C datasets under similar conditions did not show the classic MD structure ( Cagliero et al., 2013 3. Cagliero, C. ∙ Grand, R.S. ∙ Jones, M.B. ... Genome conformation capture reveals that the Escherichia coli chromosome is organized by replication and transcription Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :6058-6071 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ); likewise, the data in Figure 2 A show no barriers at the 3C-identified MD locations. Given the presence of discrepant data regarding the nature of MDs, these will be referred to as chromosomal regions instead, maintaining the locations of the original boundaries for convenience and continuity, but using a slightly modified nomenclature described in Figure 1 B.
The transposition data are derived from an asynchronous population in which many cells have partially replicated chromosomes, with Ori and its flanking regions having moved toward the cell poles, while Ter and its flanking regions are often still unreplicated and located at the mid cell ( Figure S1 C). A higher frequency of interactions would be expected between the replichore arms during segregation, compared to unreplicated regions ( Figure S1 B). The transposition frequencies from all 35 strains are consistent with the expected increase in trans -replichore interactions for replicated portions of the chromosome ( Figures S1 D and S1E), with a break point at the mid-positions relative to oriC and dif , reflecting the average replication state of cells in the population ( Figure S1 C).
A striking feature of the view from Mu is that there are no detectable hard boundaries in the genome. If a Mu prophage was close to an expected MD boundary (based on the definitions of Valens et al. [2004 55. Valens, M. ∙ Penaud, S. ∙ Rossignol, M. ... Macrodomain organization of the Escherichia coli chromosome EMBO J. 2004; 23 :4330-4341 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ]), it crossed that boundary with impunity ( Figure 2 A). We deduce that the conformations of the chromosomes across a population of cells in similar growth states is highly heterogeneous, because if these conformations were uniform, some bin-bin interactions would be necessarily excluded from our data, because no single conformation would permit Mu transposition between all pairwise combinations of bins. The data reveal that linear distance on the genome provides no information on contact frequencies over length scales of tens of kb or longer, consistent with the overall conformation of the chromosome being well-mixed—i.e., an E. coli population will at any point contain an ensemble of conformations in which any given locus is roughly equally likely to be in contact with any other locus, regardless of genomic distance or intervening features.
To identify significant contacts implied by the efficiency of Mu transposition, a penalized regression model (LASSO) was employed, to highlight terms that contribute information to the observed contacts. Three major classes of contribution were considered: first, (linear) genomic distance between bins; second, the intrinsic reactivity of each bin as both a donor and recipient of Mu; and third, specific pairwise interactions between bins, which would reflect the presence of long-range contacts. The different abundances of DNA from different genomic bins were corrected using an offset term (see STAR Methods ).
The fits across 35 donor bins reveal several global trends in the data: First, in wild-type (WT) cells, the contribution of linear genomic distance to Mu transposition frequency is essentially non-existent, yielding no more than a 2.5% difference in transposition frequency between the nearest and farthest bins (based on the fitted LASSO coefficients). This finding indicates that the overall chromosomal structure follows a “small world” layout where any given chromosomal segment may interact with any other segment, rather than being confined to its immediate linear vicinity or by MD boundaries. Second, the contributions of the “donor” and “recipient” bin terms demonstrate that Mu transposition is particularly inefficient into or out of the Ter region, and particularly efficient into or out of the Ori region of the chromosome ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Even with the lower donor/recipient terms exhibited by Ter, however, Mu was able to insert into every bin within Ter regardless of starting location. This observation readily implies that the difficulty of Mu insertion into Ter is not indicative of the region being refractory to Mu insertion, but rather that Ter is less well-mixed with the other regions of the chromosome. The role of the Ter region in excluding MukBEF ( Nolivos et al., 2016 40. Nolivos, S. ∙ Upton, A.L. ∙ Badrinarayanan, A. ... MatP regulates the coordinated action of topoisomerase IV and MukBEF in chromosome segregation Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10466 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), a complex responsible for the well-mixed genome reported in this study (see below) may account for this property. These findings are consistent with numerous 3C-type experiments showing both that the Ter region is more isolated from the chromosome and has unique structural characteristics shaped by the activity of MatP ( Mercier et al., 2008; Cagliero et al., 2013; Lioy et al., 2018 3. Cagliero, C. ∙ Grand, R.S. ∙ Jones, M.B. ... Genome conformation capture reveals that the Escherichia coli chromosome is organized by replication and transcription Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :6058-6071 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar 30.

Mercier, R. ∙ Petit, M.A. ∙ Schbath, S. ... The MatP/matS site-specific system organizes the terminus region of the E. coli chromosome into a macrodomain Cell. 2008; 135 :475-485 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). The relatively high reactivity of Ori may be due to special organizational features related to its mobility over the course of the cell cycle, or (within the context of the kinetic model discussed below) the fact that Ori will on average have had more time post-replication to relax due to being replicated first.
The LASSO model terms described above accounts for global effects due to DNA abundance, linear genomic distance, and intrinsic properties of the bins themselves with regards to Mu transposition. When the contributions of genomic abundance and donor/recipient effects are removed, the small world well-mixed view of the chromosome becomes readily apparent, as transposition frequencies become nearly uniform ( Figure S2 ). The last class of terms included in the model were those for specific interactions between bin pairs, which directly represent pairwise bin combinations that have significantly higher or lower transposition rates than can be explained by the global terms described above. Due to the direct contact-based mechanism of Mu transposition, we interpret the presence of significant interaction terms as indicating higher or lower rates of physical contact between the indicated bins, analogous to the contact frequencies inferred from normalized HiC data. As shown in Figure 3 A, the plurality of sampled bin-bin interactions occur at a basal level, with a fitted contact coefficient frequency of zero (beige color). However, numerous significant and informative interaction terms survive in our fully fitted model ( Figure 3 is also available as an interactive html file provided in Data S1 ).
Several of the significant interactions correspond to bins containing genes that are distant in linear genomic space but expected to be co-regulated. For example, Bin 72 ( Figure 3 B) shows the fitted interaction profile for a prophage located in the same bin as the rrnD operon (∼10 kb away). For this Mu donor location, the bins containing the rrnA , B , E , G , and H operons show significantly positive interaction terms, suggesting physical co-localization. These findings support earlier work in which fluorescent imaging showed spatial co-localization of six of the seven rRNA operons in E. coli ( Gaal et al., 2016 13. Gaal, T. ∙ Bratton, B.P. ∙ Sanchez-Vazquez, P. ... Colocalization of distant chromosomal loci in space in E. coli: a bacterial nucleolus Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :2272-2285 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the interaction between Bin 72 and Bin 84 (the latter containing the rrnC operon; marked with an asterisk in Figure 3 B) does not have a significant positive interaction (in fact, this interaction term is negative). This exception is surprising, but consistent with the findings of Gaal et al. (2016) 13. Gaal, T. ∙ Bratton, B.P. ∙ Sanchez-Vazquez, P. ... Colocalization of distant chromosomal loci in space in E. coli: a bacterial nucleolus Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :2272-2285 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar where all but the rrnC operons are in close proximity.
Similar trends emerged with other co-regulated gene clusters within the contact matrix ( Figure 3 A). Besides the rrn clusters, a predominant gene cluster to emerge is one specifying the replisome machinery ( Figures 3 C and 3D) as seen in Bins 5 ( dnaQ ), 83 ( dnaA and dnaN ), and 91 ( dnaB ). Even though dnaQ and dnaA are nearly 1 Mb apart in linear distance on the chromosome, the bins containing these genes co-localize within the nucleoid. A similar evidence of clustering was observed in the phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway. Bin 38 contains the pheT gene and is seen to strongly cluster with Bins 16 and 58 containing the aroG and pheL genes, respectively ( Figure 3 E). Higher resolution probing may detect many more of such clustering events. Notably absent from the contact map provided here is any hint of the classic MDs, which would be expected to form boxes of high interaction frequency centered on the diagonal. At the same time, strong and specific off-diagonal interactions were observed between loci that are located in different MDs, as highlighted in Figures 3 B–3E. Thus, while the conformation of the chromosome is “well-mixed” with respect to large-scale conformation, the data indicate that there are several specific pairwise interactions between distant loci that are consistently preserved within the broader context of the mostly random structure of the chromosome.
To corroborate the observations of clustered gene groups noted in Figure 3 , co-localization of specific genes was tested via fluorescence microscopy using the parS/ParB FROS approach. Two different par sites (parSP1 and parST1) were placed in the parent strain MG1655 (devoid of Mu), close to a pair of genes being interrogated. These sites can be visualized by co-expression of their cognate fluorescent ParB proteins (P1 CFP-ParB and T1 GFP-ParB). Using this approach, the co-localization of rrnD and rrnG loci were readily detected ( Figure S3 ), consistent with the Mu transposition results and earlier experiments ( Gaal et al., 2016 13. Gaal, T. ∙ Bratton, B.P. ∙ Sanchez-Vazquez, P. ... Colocalization of distant chromosomal loci in space in E. coli: a bacterial nucleolus Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :2272-2285 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). The same methodology was then applied to test two families of clusters inferred solely from the Mu transposition data.
As noted above, there was a strong co-localization of several genes involved in DNA replication. The bins containing dnaA and dnaB (Bins 83 and 91) are too close to be distinguished by microscopy using FROS ( Figure 4 A) ( Heintzmann and Ficz, 2006 19. Heintzmann, R. ∙ Ficz, G. Breaking the resolution limit in light microscopy Brief. Funct. Genomics Proteomics. 2006; 5 :289-301 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ), so the par sites were placed next to dnaA and dnaQ in one strain, and next to dnaB and dnaQ in another strain. As controls, two strains with par site markers at similar linear distances to the dna gene pairs, but at positions that were not identified as being clustered, were evaluated.
Figure 4 B shows representative imaging data for parSP/parST locations near the clustered loci dnaQ and dnaB (panel 1) as compared with the ytfP and yibT control (panel 3). The former were measured as being (on average) 120 nm apart, whereas the latter were 235 nm apart ( Figure 4 C). Similarly, parSP/parST pairs located near dnaA and dnaQ showed an average distance of 144 nm ( Figure 4 B, panel 2), whereas the control dnaA/ygbI yielded distances of 286 nm. The differences in distances between each clustered locus pair and the corresponding control were statistically significant using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p < 0.005), and the negative control locus pairs further match the average distance expected by chance within an ellipse with a long axis of 1 μm and short axis of 0.5 μm (270 nm; see Figure S3 C). To our knowledge, the physical co-localization of these strongly co-regulated dna genes has not been observed previously. It is notable, however, that a re-analysis of an early E. coli high-throughput 3C dataset also suggested general three-dimensional co-localization of co-regulated genes ( Xie et al., 2015 60. Xie, T. ∙ Fu, L.Y. ∙ Yang, Q.Y. ... Spatial features for Escherichia coli genome organization BMC Genomics. 2015; 16 :37 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A second family of clustered genes, pheL (Bin 58) and aroG (Bin 16) was interrogated next. The transposition data indicated that both Bins 58 and 16 were co-localized with Bin 38 (Ter), which contains pheT . All three genes are encoded in operons involved in the synthesis of phenylalanine ( Pittard and Yang, 2008 43. Pittard, J. ∙ Yang, J. Biosynthesis of the Aromatic Amino Acids Ecosal Plus. 2008; 3 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), making this another example of clustering of co-functional genes. Par sites were placed within 1 kb of pheL and aroG located on the left and right chromosomal arms ( Figures 5 A and 5B). A bimodal distribution of the nearest aroG - pheL distance was observed, which appears to be determined by the number of aroG foci present in the cell ( Figure 5 C). In cells where aroG has been replicated (2 GFP foci), there was a much higher degree of co-localization between aroG and pheL ; one GFP focus would be co-localized with the CFP focus while the other was separated on the other side of the cell, whereas no contact was apparent in cells with a single aroG copy. This result indicates that co-localization of aroG and pheL is dependent on the extent of replication for any given cell, and the enhanced contact frequency observed in the LASSO analysis reflects the averaging of many distinct conformations present in our heterogeneous cell population. Figure 5 D highlights the distribution of the four types of localization, based on the replication status of aroG and pheL . To test the generality of the replication-dependent clustering observed for aroG and pheL , the GFP-labeled rrnD and CFP-labeled rrnG loci were followed because rrnD is near the origin and thus replicated by the majority of cells in the asynchronous experimental population, whereas rrnG will frequently not be replicated ( Figure S1 E). Consistent with these expectations, data in Figure S3 A show that the bulk of the population has two GFP foci and one CFP focus for every cell. In such cells, the CFP focus is localized with one of the two GFP loci, consistent with the pheL/aroG observations ( Figure 5 ). However, unlike the case with cells harboring single pheL and aroG foci, in cells harboring single GFP and CFP rrn foci, these foci still co-localize, as indicated by the lack of a bimodal distribution ( Figure S3 B). These data suggest two categories of clustering—replication-dependent and replication-independent, which are likely driven by different biological mechanisms.
The co-localization of several gene classes detected by Mu may arise either as a direct result of forces (e.g., shared DNA-binding proteins) that bind and compact the specific loci involved or reflect a broader intrinsic feature of the chromosomal regions in which those genes are found. The former hypothesis was ruled out by experiments presented and discussed in Figure S4 A, in which highly interacting loci were transplanted without corresponding rearrangements of clustering patterns, observations also supported by gene product network maps ( Figure S4 B). The data are consistent with those of Gaal et al. that co-localization of rrn operons is driven by properties of flanking chromosomal regions rather than transcription of the ribosomal RNAs themselves. These findings suggest that clustering may arise during normal cellular processes of genome replication/compaction, and that these positions were likely exploited by evolutionary forces to position some genes in clustered regions for facilitating efficient co-regulation.
To test the role of genome compacting mechanisms in clustering, Mu transposition was monitored in strains with deletions of genes encoding architectural functions. Because of its well-documented rrn clustering behavior, Mu insertions from Bin 72 were initially tracked to monitor the effects of deletion of several NAPs on rRNA operon clustering. Deletions in genes encoding several general or specific NAPs— fis , hupB , hns , ihfA , and matP —showed little to no effect on transposition patterns ( Figure S5 ). HU is a heterodimeric protein (encoded by hupA and hupB ), but can function as a homodimer of the A(α) or B(β) subunit ( Dillon and Dorman, 2010 8. Dillon, S.C. ∙ Dorman, C.J. Bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins, nucleoid structure and gene expression Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8 :185-195 Crossref Scopus (645) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mu requires HU for transposition, but either α or β homodimers are sufficient ( Figure S5 ) ( Huisman et al., 1989 20. Huisman, O. ∙ Faelen, M. ∙ Girard, D. ... Multiple defects in Escherichia coli mutants lacking HU protein J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171 :3704-3712 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
A striking change in Mu insertion patterns (monitored from Bin 72) was seen in strains with deletions of mukB or, to a slightly lesser extent, hupA ( Figure 6 A). MukB is an essential subunit of the SMC-like MukBEF complex, a functional homolog of the loop-extruding condensins in eukaryotes ( Dillon and Dorman, 2010; Rybenkov et al., 2014; Terakawa et al., 2017; Ganji et al., 2018; Lioy et al., 2018 8.

Because of the more pronounced change in insertion patterns for the mukB mutant compared to hupA , the mukB patterns were monitored from the 6 chromosomal regions ( Figure 1 B). Contrary to WT cells, Mu insertion frequencies exhibited a distance-dependent behavior in the hupA and mukB strains, where linear genomic distance became a dominant predictor of interaction frequencies. Figure 6 B shows the results of a simple regression fit, for transpositions across different genomic distances in each strain of interest. The loss of “small world” behavior in these mutant genotypes is sufficient to cause a 3.5-fold drop in average contact frequencies between opposed points on the chromosome in the mukB strains, and a 2.2-fold drop in the hupA strain. Thus, MukBEF and HU-α, proteins that compact the genome, also promote widespread genomic contacts.
The unique sensitivity of the Mu transposition method in identifying region-specific long-range contacts also permits assessment of the effects of architectural protein deletions on clustering. As seen in Figure 6 C, while deletion of fis has no notable effect on clustering, the hupA mutant has lost some meaningful rrn clusterings (at least as assessed by contacts with the rrnD -containing Bin 72). Wilcoxon rank-sum tests of the difference in median between interactions of Bin 72 with other rrn loci-containing bins yields p values <0.01 for all genotypes except hupA , and 0.74 for the hupA mutant. The loss of significant rrn clustering in the hupA genotype is driven by loss of contacts between Bin 72 and the bins containing rrnB and rrnE , which fall below the 25 th percentile of contact frequencies rather than above the 75 th percentile in the corresponding WT sample. In contrast, ribosomal RNA operon clustering of the mukB deletion appears similar to that observed for WT cells, and shows significant enrichment relative to background (p = 0.005, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). MukBEF is therefore not involved in the formation of long distance contacts between rrn operons. Note that despite the presence of several Fis binding sites in rrn promoters, Fis does not participate in clustering ( Gaal et al., 2016 13. Gaal, T. ∙ Bratton, B.P. ∙ Sanchez-Vazquez, P. ... Colocalization of distant chromosomal loci in space in E. coli: a bacterial nucleolus Genes Dev. 2016; 30 :2272-2285 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 ).
Given the profound loss of the well-mixed chromosomal conformation in both mukB and hupA mutants, we sought to obtain additional information on the large-scale effects of both deletions on chromosomal structure. Loss of MukB has previously been shown to cause decondensation of the nucleoid ( Kumar et al., 2017 24. Kumar, R. ∙ Grosbart, M. ∙ Nurse, P. ... The bacterial condensin MukB compacts DNA by sequestering supercoils and stabilizing topologically isolated loops J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :16904-16920 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas comparatively little evidence is available regarding the effects of loss of HU-α; the HU subunits generally complement each other without observable phenotypes ( Wada et al., 1988; Macvanin and Adhya, 2012 31. Macvanin, M. ∙ Adhya, S. Architectural organization in E. coli nucleoid Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819 :830-835 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Wada, M. ∙ Kano, Y. ∙ Ogawa, T. ... Construction and characterization of the deletion mutant of hupA and hupB genes in Escherichia coli J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204 :581-591 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of the distributions of nucleoids from WT, mukB , and hupA cells showed that the mukB cells exhibit substantial nucleoid decondensation (consistent with prior findings), whereas the degrees of compaction of WT and hupA nucleoids are virtually indistinguishable ( Figure S6 ).
The data thus indicate that MukBEF and HU-α are both responsible for generating the well-mixed chromosome, although it is not clear whether they act in tandem or through complementary mechanisms. HU-α appears to play an additional role in establishing the stable, long-range contacts between ribosomal RNA operons that are fixed features of the E. coli chromosome. The small-world organization of the chromosome is not simply a constant property of a well-compacted nucleoid (as might have been expected given prior knowledge of the effects of MukB on nucleoid compaction), as loss of hupA leads to loss of long-range contact formation without nucleoid decompaction. The requirement for HU-α but not for the HU-β subunit for both clustering and global genome access, reveals a physiologically important difference between these closely related proteins, which were previously assumed to be interchangeable.
To provide further insight into what physical processes might shape the contact map patterns observed in the Mu transposition data, we made use of a simple polymer model of the bacterial chromosome; an example conformation of the genome using the model is shown in Figure 7 A. In contrast with many other modeling efforts on bacterial chromosomes ( Umbarger et al., 2011; Hacker et al., 2017; Yildirim and Feig, 2018 16. Hacker, W.C. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Elcock, A.H. Features of genomic organization in a nucleotide-resolution molecular model of the Escherichia coli chromosome Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :7541-7554 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Umbarger, M.A. ∙ Toro, E. ∙ Wright, M.A. ... The three-dimensional architecture of a bacterial genome and its alteration by genetic perturbation Mol. Cell. 2011; 44 :252-264 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Yildirim, A. ∙ Feig, M. High-resolution 3D models of Caulobacter crescentus chromosome reveal genome structural variability and organization Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :3937-3952 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) (see STAR Methods for a detailed comparison), the model was not designed to reproduce any precise contact map, nor were inter-bead contacts parameterized on the basis of the Mu transposition data. Rather, the genome was divided into 965 ∼4.8 kb regions (beads), interacting via harmonic potentials with adjacent beads, and through a Lennard-Jones potential with all other beads (see Figure 7 B). Folding of the chromosome was simulated starting from a fully circular structure, working from the ansatz that at some point during replication, the chromosome will be functionally extended due to a combination of replication, origin re-localization, decatenation, and cell division.
The contact maps observed in folding simulations using this simple polymer model reproduce two important classes of maps that are observed in various experimental datasets. Over short simulation times, the contact maps ( Figure 7 C) are dominated by short-range interactions, and closely resemble the landscapes seen in Mu transposition experiments in mukB and hupA cells, as well as qualitatively resembling (aside from the lack of MDs and CIDs) the distance dependence observed by others in HiC-type experiments ( Lioy et al., 2018 30. Lioy, V.S. ∙ Cournac, A. ∙ Marbouty, M. ... Multiscale Structuring of the E. coli Chromosome by Nucleoid-Associated and Condensin Proteins Cell. 2018; 172 :771-783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the chromosome is allowed to reach equilibrium, the initial distance dependence is lost, and contact frequencies with distant beads become uniform ( Figure 7 D). Thus, for a simple ring polymer approximation of the E. coli chromosome, the equilibrium structure is in fact the “well-mixed” structure that is observed via Mu transposition. In interpreting these simulation results, it is important to note that the model used here is intentionally very simple, and reflects the behavior of a featureless polymer with broad topological and structural similarities to the E. coli chromosome (see Characteristics of the Polymer Model ). It is nevertheless remarkable that a well-mixed conformation is in fact achieved by a simple ring polymer without the need for any bias toward long-range interactions. Deviations from this structure in experimental datasets must arise from either a specific process altering the structure of the chromosome that is not represented in the model (e.g., formation of specific contacts or conformational barriers), changes in the average strength of nucleoid cohesion that lead to a change in the chromosome’s equilibrium state ( Figure S7 D), or non-equilibrium effects where the chromosomal conformations of the population of cells being observed has not yet had time to relax fully to the small-world state (a kinetic trap in nucleoid folding after replication/division)—that is, changes in the overall behavior of the contact map may in fact arise from either thermodynamic or kinetic effects.
While the data on the mukB mutant in isolation might have been interpreted as a phase transition in the nucleoid structure ( Figures S7 D and S7E), the data regarding the DNA distribution in hupA nucleoids ( Figure S6 ) instead favors a kinetic argument, as the small-world contact map can be lost without causing nucleoid decompaction. The data suggest that MukBEF and HUα act to catalyze relaxation from a short-range ordered state (as in Figure 7 C) to a well-mixed state (as in Figure 7 D), promoting mixing by avoiding kinetic trapping and allowing the nucleoid to relax to the well-mixed state. Indeed, the FROS data presented in Figure 5 provide strong evidence for the presence and importance of non-equilibrium effects on chromosomal structure: the pheL and aroG loci are co-localized in cells that had recently replicated the pheL locus (38% of the population), but not those with only a single copy of pheL (that must have undergone a longer waiting time since the last time pheL was replicated).
To test the feasibility of the proposed mechanism that MukBEF enhances mixing by accelerating relaxation kinetics of the chromosome (in addition to its well-known role in nucleoid compaction), a MukBEF-like loop extrusion activity was implemented in the polymer simulation, in which “loops” were randomly formed (and subsequently broken; see STAR Methods for details) at regular intervals, and the relaxation rates of the chromosome with versus without dynamic loop formation were then compared. As shown in Figures 7 E and 7F, simulated nucleoids with dynamic MukBEF loops showed relaxation times toward abundant long-range contacts that were substantially faster than those without dynamic loops. Thus, in the simplified chromosomal model described above, MukBEF-like activity alone is sufficient to accelerate equilibration of the chromosome. The kinetic hypothesis offers an explanation for several aspects of the experimental findings described above regarding the effects of MukB without any need to explicitly participate in forming long-range contacts (indeed, MukBEF-mediated loop extrusion would intuitively be expected to promote more short-range order in addition to overall compaction, as discussed in more detail in Effects of MukB Loop Extrusion on Chromosomal Relaxation ). The contribution of functional HU-α to chromosomal mixing is not yet entirely clear; it may arise either due to some mechanistic interplay with the MukBEF complex or through other effects of HU binding (such as containment of negative supercoiling) ( Lal et al., 2016 25. Lal, A. ∙ Dhar, A. ∙ Trostel, A. ... Genome scale patterns of supercoiling in a bacterial chromosome Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11055 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ) that ultimately enhance the rate of chromosomal relaxation.
The kinetic model for chromosomal ordering described here also offers an explanation for the distinction between replication-dependent (e.g., pheL-aroG ) and replication-independent (e.g., rrn clustering) interactions. We hypothesize that the pheL - aroG interaction is characteristic of a metastable conformation ( Figure 7 G, middle panel) that occurs transiently, but is subsequently lost during relaxation of the chromosome to an equilibrium state ( Figure 7 G, right panel). In contrast, the replication-independent interactions are apparently sufficiently strong that they persist throughout the cell cycle and are either not broken or swiftly re-form after replication of the regions of the chromosome involved in any particular interaction. It is possible to envision a third category of interactions, which form preferentially in the relaxed state, and would only be observed after longer time periods since the most recent replication event. No instances of such behavior have been directly observed. The potential kinetic distinctions between different categories of interactions outlined here may provide a useful test in the future of the hypothesis of kinetic control of the chromosomal conformations.
Compared with recent 3C datasets ( Cagliero et al., 2013; Lioy et al., 2018 3. Cagliero, C. ∙ Grand, R.S. ∙ Jones, M.B. ... Genome conformation capture reveals that the Escherichia coli chromosome is organized by replication and transcription Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :6058-6071 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Lioy, V.S. ∙ Cournac, A. ∙ Marbouty, M. ... Multiscale Structuring of the E. coli Chromosome by Nucleoid-Associated and Condensin Proteins Cell. 2018; 172 :771-783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), Mu transposition-based mapping shows several distinct differences, including revelation of a well-mixed chromosome unconstrained by linear distance and an apparent lack of substantial barriers to contact between any arbitrary locations on the chromosome (although, as shown in Figure S7 A, a similar picture emerges upon re-analysis of one such experiment; re-analysis of that dataset also showed the presence of co-localization of co-regulated genes consistent with the clustering that was noted above) ( Xie et al., 2015 60. Xie, T. ∙ Fu, L.Y. ∙ Yang, Q.Y. ... Spatial features for Escherichia coli genome organization BMC Genomics. 2015; 16 :37 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Mu transposition and microscopy data described above also revealed and corroborated several clustering interactions between distant chromosomal loci not observed in genomic 3C maps. It is important to consider possible causes for the discrepancies between the methods, and what useful data might be extracted from each. Current Mu datasets lack a sufficient density of donor sites to permit comparison with the CID structures inferred from high-throughput 3C experiments; probing at this level of structure will be a promising future application for higher-throughput variants of the Mu procedure, but at present, we cannot make any statements regarding discrepancy or concordance with CIDs or other fine-grain features of the Hi-C and high-throughput 3C data, and focus instead on the prevalence of local versus long-range contacts, and large-scale “macrodomain” structures, between the methods.
The most obvious difference between 3C/Hi-C experiments and mapping of contacts based on Mu transposition is that the former methods require crosslinking of growing cells with formaldehyde. Additional factors include choice of endonucleases, ligation times, and different methods of data treatment ( Cagliero et al., 2013; Le and Laub, 2016; Schmitt et al., 2016 3. Cagliero, C. ∙ Grand, R.S. ∙ Jones, M.B. ... Genome conformation capture reveals that the Escherichia coli chromosome is organized by replication and transcription Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :6058-6071 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Le, T.B. ∙ Laub, M.T. Transcription rate and transcript length drive formation of chromosomal interaction domain boundaries EMBO J. 2016; 35 :1582-1595 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar 47. Schmitt, A.D. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Ren, B. Genome-wide mapping and analysis of chromosome architecture Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 :743-755 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). As detailed in Figures S7 B and S7C, simulation results using the polymer model employed above show that at least in that coarse-grained model, the sequential formation of bonds between chromosomal components in spatial proximity (as occurs with formaldehyde crosslinking) is sufficient to force the chromosome into an alternative conformation dominated by short-range contacts, and under appropriate initial conditions can lead to formation of macrodomain-like structures.
The above findings on the effects of mukB or hupA deletions on long-range ordering are consistent with the conclusion drawn from high throughput 3C experiments ( Lioy et al., 2018 30. Lioy, V.S. ∙ Cournac, A. ∙ Marbouty, M. ... Multiscale Structuring of the E. coli Chromosome by Nucleoid-Associated and Condensin Proteins Cell. 2018; 172 :771-783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), that MukBEF, together with HU, contributes to long-distance contacts. The 3C contact map shows a less dramatic distinction between the WT and mukB/hupAB mutant; this is likely because the 3C maps are dominated by short-range local contacts even in WT cells. Conversely, the Mu transposition profiles only become dominated by similar short-range interactions upon the deletion of mukB or hupA , suggesting that the 3C map may be biased toward reporting of contacts between proximal loci (possibly due to the use of formaldehyde crosslinking over the course of sample preparation).
Taken together, one possible interpretation of the differences between Mu-based and 3C-based interaction maps in E. coli is that the former represents a population average of the direct chromosomal contacts at the time of Mu induction, whereas 3C will report the presence of highly connected regions in the vicinity of any long-range chromosomal contacts present at the time when crosslinking begins, which are amplified due to self-reinforcing crosslinking. The utility of the methods thus may differ depending on the biological problem of interest.
We have provided a map of genome organization in E. coli through the use of Mu transposition as an in vivo tool to monitor DNA-DNA contacts. Mu insertion profiles show convincing evidence that long-range genomic interactions are frequent, and that the genome is broadly well-mixed and devoid of hard regional boundaries. Statistical analysis of the transposition provided evidence of extensive “clustering” or spatial proximity of distant bins, frequently those containing genes of similar function. The SMC-like complex MukBEF and the nucleoid-associated protein HU-α play significant and positive roles in promoting mixing and relaxation of the chromosome, and in their absence the genome’s small-world properties and many specific long-distance clusters are lost. By combining genome-wide transposition data with insights from a simple physical model, we show that the overall conformational distribution of the chromosome can be explained by a constant tension between order imposed by genome replication, and relaxation toward a highly disordered state that is encouraged by the loop-extruding and genome-condensing properties of the nucleoid-associated protein complexes MukBEF and HUα. We hypothesize that this tension, superimposed on the global structural requirements of cell division and a small number of specific, high-affinity long distance interactions, gives rise to the overall chromosomal architecture of an E. coli population.
The findings presented here provide a set of fundamental governing principles of the E. coli chromosome: that as a rule, the chromosome follows small-world properties where all genomic loci are able to intermix spatially, but that chromosomal replication induces a transiently ordered state in which linear distance does matter. We are now able to lay the foundation for future work determining the precise physical forces driving functional clustering, and the regulatory consequences of the observed co-localizations. It is reasonable to speculate that similar patterns of conformational dynamics—kinetically controlled relaxation to a well-mixed conformational ensemble—apply more generally across the tree of life.

All experimental strains used are derivatives of MG1655 and listed in the Key Resources Table . E. coli DH5α was used as a host to grow and purify plasmids. All MG1655 gene deletion strains were created by transducing these alleles from the Keio collection ( Baba et al., 2006 1. Baba, T. ∙ Ara, T. ∙ Hasegawa, M. ... Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2 2006.0008 Crossref Scopus (5818) Google Scholar ) using phage P1, with the exception of mukB . Initial parS strains and the pFH2973 plasmid containing the fluorophore labeled ParB proteins were generously gifted to us from Olivier Espeli and Rick Gourse. Additional parS mutants where generated using the methodology reported in earlier work ( Espeli et al., 2008 9. Espeli, O. ∙ Mercier, R. ∙ Boccard, F. DNA dynamics vary according to macrodomain topography in the E. coli chromosome Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68 :1418-1427 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oligonucleotides used in this study are all provided in Table S1 .
Mu::parSP1 strains were generated by amplifying the parS site from DMW220 using the oligonucleotides Mu_parS_f and Mu_parS_R. The PCR product was concentrated using the Qiaquick PCR cleanup kit, and electroporated into a Mu lysogen containing pKD46. The parS:: kan and Mu:: cam cells were identified by initial selection for kanamycin resistance (Kan R ) and chloramphenicol resistance (Cam R ), respectively, followed by confirmation by DNA sequencing. The parSP1 site was placed inside the semi-essential region of Mu, where it replaced nucleotides (nt) 5138 to 7233. The parSP1 site was then transferred to a fresh Mu lysogen (DMW24) using P1 transduction to generate DMW221.
Partial mukB deletion was generated by eliminating a PstI-PstI region within the coding sequence of mukB by inserting a Kan R gene via recombineering, both to disrupt mukB and to infer selection. This was done by first amplifying the Kan R gene from pKD4 ( Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 7. Datsenko, K.A. ∙ Wanner, B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :6640-6645 Crossref Scopus (11854) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the oligonucleotides mukB F and mukB R to provide homology sequences with the mukB gene. The PCR product was then electroporated into Mu lysogens containing the Amp R plasmid pKD46, which provides lambda Red recombination functions ( Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 7. Datsenko, K.A. ∙ Wanner, B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :6640-6645 Crossref Scopus (11854) PubMed Google Scholar ). After selection for Kan R , pKD46 was cured from the strain through successive streaking on Kan plates and testing for Amp sensitivity. mukB deletion strains were grown at room temperature (∼21°C) and had a significantly slower growth curve compared to other strains.
Oligonucleotides (See Table S1 ) pKD4_pheLf and pKD4_pheLr were used to amplify pheL and its promoter off the MG1655 chromosome spanning from nt position 2737579 to 2737744 with an additional 5′ AlwNI restriction site and a 3′ BglII restriction site for the construction of plasmid pDMW33. The resulting PCR product was 178 bp in length. Both the plasmid pKD4 and the pheL PCR product were digested with the restriction enzymes AlwNI and BlgII simultaneously. The restriction digest products were gel purified and ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation product was electroporated into DH5α and selected for Kan R . Plasmid construction was confirmed via gel size shift and sequencing. pheL was moved into separate locations within the E. coli chromosome at nt positions 522930 and 1418108 by amplifying the pheL : kan construct from pDW33. The PCR product for each amplification was inserted into a MG1655 strain containing pKD46 and successful constructs were selected by Kan R . Subsequently the pheL : kan gene was transduced via P1 phage into fresh DMW235. Oligonucleotides pheL_Bin10f and pheL_Bin10r were used to amplify the pheL : kan construct for recombineering into nt position 522930, and oligonucleotides pheL_Bin30f and pheL_Bin30r were used for recombineering into nt position 1418108.
E. coli cells were grown in a M9-Cas minimal media consisting of M9 salts with 50 μg/mL casamino acids, 0.2% glucose, 100 μg/mL thiamine, and appropriate antibiotics. All cells were incubated at 30°C unless otherwise stated for temperature induction.
Transposition of Mu is absolutely dependent on MuA/MuB-mediated DNA-DNA interactions, where the ends of Mu insert into a random target DNA locus ( Figure 1 A). The high efficiency and low target specificity of Mu transposition allow us to explore the frequency of such interactions within the E. coli genome. To ensure that the presence of the prophage did not cause gross changes in chromosomal topology, the positions of two fluorescent parS/ParB reporters ( Nielsen et al., 2006 37. Nielsen, H.J. ∙ Ottesen, J.R. ∙ Youngren, B. ... The Escherichia coli chromosome is organized with the left and right chromosome arms in separate cell halves Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62 :331-338 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ) placed on each arm of the chromosome were monitored in the presence or absence of a prophage. The average distance between the two reporters was independent of the prophage. To induce Mu transposition, the experimental set up used the inactivation of a thermosensitive Mu repressor that otherwise keeps the prophage silent. Using the statistical analysis of the Mu transposition sites from whole genome sequencing data, a 10-minute time-frame was determined to be sufficient for Mu to go through only one round of transposition at the inducing temperature. Using parS-labeled Mu (Mu::parS), only one GFP focus per cell was observed in an uninduced population, and two foci on average after 10 minutes of induction ( Videos S1 and S2 ), corroborating the genome sequencing data at the single cell level and demonstrating that the most common experimental outcome was a single transposition event. Mu::parS has a sub-diffusive trajectory, both before and after Mu induction ( Videos S1 and S2 ), consistent with other tracked loci on the chromosome ( Espeli et al., 2008 9. Espeli, O. ∙ Mercier, R. ∙ Boccard, F. DNA dynamics vary according to macrodomain topography in the E. coli chromosome Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68 :1418-1427 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus Mu does not acquire ballistic or superdiffusive properties during transposition. The replication status of the cells at the time of Mu induction was also deduced using parS sites placed at four different locations on the genome and fluorophore-labeled ParB; at the time of Mu induction, the genome was partially replicated with ∼95% of cells having two Ori loci moved toward the cell poles from the mid cell ( Figure S1 C). Similar growth and induction conditions were used for all 35 prophages to determine the sites of Mu insertion after the first round of transposition.
10 mL of M9-Cas media were inoculated with 10 μL of the overnight MG1655 subculture. The 10 mL culture was grown at 30°C while shaking until an OD of ∼0.4 was reached. Cell counts were estimated using a Biorad SmartSpec Plus spectrophotometer. Mu:: cat was added to the MG1655 culture to an MOI of 0.1 and set to shaking at 30°C for 30 minutes. Sterile sodium citrate was added to the reaction to a concentration of 250 mM. The reaction was spun down at 3000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge and resuspended in 200 μL of 0.5% NaCl, 250 mM sodium citrate solution. The solution was plated on LB Cam plates and incubated for 30°C for 18 hours. Lysogens were selected for Cam R .
Single colonies were selected for overnight growth in 5 mL LB broth shaking at 30°C. Genomes were purified using the Wizard genome purification kit. The genomic DNA was diluted to 40 ng/uL and sheared by sonication. The sheared DNA was run through a QIAGEN PCR cleanup column to remove < 100 bp fragments and ssDNA. The sheared DNA was then extended on the 3′ end using terminal deoxynucleotdyl transferase (TdT) with a 16:1 ratio of dCTP and ddCTP. The TdT reaction was then PCR amplified using a nested PCR protocol. Each PCR reaction consisted of an initial melting temp at 95°C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 58°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 1 min. A final extension of 72°C for 2 min was performed and the reaction product was held at 4°C until collected. The first round of PCR (PCR1) consisted of the extension oligonucleotides rand_polyG paired with either Mu_L213 or Mu_R137. The template DNA for PCR1 was the TdT reaction product. The second round of PCR used the product from PCR1 as the template with the extension oligonucleotides being rand_seq paired with either Mu_L213 or Mu_R137. The PCR product was sequenced by the departmental core facility using the appropriate Mu end oligonucleotide (Mu_L213 or Mu_R137), and the sequencing results where aligned with the MG1655 genome using Command Line Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. The first 200 bases read are expected to align to Mu, while the first segment that aligns with MG1655 is taken to be the phage position.
Mu lysogens where grown shaking ON at 30°C from single colonies in M9-Cas/Cam. Ten microliters of overnight growth where used to inoculate 10 mL of fresh M9-Cas/Cam in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The 10 mL cultures were incubated at 30°C shaking until an O.D. of ∼0.4 was reached (typically 3 hours). The culture was then temperature shifted to 42°C for 10 minutes. The cells were fixed with −20°C 95% ethanol and stored in 95% ethanol at −20°C until the genomes were purified. Lysogen genomic DNA (gDNA) was purified through use of the Wizard kit. Purified genomes were stored in a 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA buffer at −20°C until submitted for sequencing.
Individual gDNA samples were submitted to the Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility (GSAF) at the departmental core facility for sequencing. Libraries were prepped by GSAF using a low-cost high throughput library preparation method; the input material was either plain genomic DNA (for the original datasets discussed in Figures 2 and 3 and associated text) or enriched pools targeting the Mu insertion sites (for the data discussed in Figure 6 ) Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Hi-Seq platform using 2X150 paired end reads targeting 20 million reads per sample. Initial Alignments where performed on the Lonestar5 super-computing cluster provided by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) using a modified Burrows-Wheeler Alignment algorithm (BWA-MEM). The fastq files for all sequencing can be found online in the Sequence Reads Archive (See Key Resources Table ).
For Mu target enrichment, purified genomic DNA was digested with HinP1. The digested DNA was ligated with the Y-linker sequence y_link using a Quick ligation kit. Ligation was quenched with the addition of EDTA to 20 mM. Ligation product was purified and concentrated using magnetic beads (Axygen). The ligation product was then PCR amplified using the oligos Mu_L31 and y_linkrev and the same PCR thermocycler program as describe earlier. PCR product was verified on a 1% Agarose gel and purified using magnetic beads. Purified product was frozen at −20°C until submission for sequencing.
MG1655 strains with integrated parS sites and the plasmid (pFH2973) carrying IPTG-inducible parBSP1 -yGFP and parBST1 -CFP were grown as described above until an OD ∼0.4 was reached. IPTG was added to the cultures at a concentration of 100 uM, and left shaking at 30°C for 1 hr. One mL of cells were spun down, and resuspended in 200 uL of M9-Cas and placed on a 1.5% agar pad.
Strains DMW22, DMW200, and DMW204 were grown in M9-Cas to an OD ∼0.6 mL. At appropriate optical densities, 5 mL of cell culture were spun down and resuspended in 400 uL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were then fixed in 6.4 mL of 74% ice cold methanol for a final concentration of 70% methanol. Cells were spun down and washed twice in PBS, and finally resuspended into 600 uL of PBS. FM4-64 dye was added to the cell solution to 0.5 μg ml -1 and stained for 1 min at room temperature in the dark for cell membrane visualization. Cells were deposited in a chamber created by attaching a poly-L-lysine coated coverslip to a glass microscope slide by double-sided tape and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature before being washed twice with 40 uL of PBS. Nucleoid staining was achieved by washing the cells with 40 uL of 300 nM DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) followed by a wash with PBS after 30 s of staining.
All microscopy was carried out on an Olympus BX53 Fluorescent Microscope under 100x magnification, and images where acquired using the CellSense software. GFP, CFP, RFP and UV filters were used to view GFP, CFP, FM4-64, and DAPI fluorescence, respectively.
Regulatory pathways (including metabolism, DNA/RNA synthesis, DNA repair etc) and their constituent genes were identified using the genomic database ( Keseler et al., 2017 22. Keseler, I.M. ∙ Mackie, A. ∙ Santos-Zavaleta, A. ... The EcoCyc database: reflecting new knowledge about Escherichia coli K-12 Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D543-D550 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ). The genome was partitioned into 100 equally sized bins as in Figure 1 B. For any bin of interest (Bin i), all genes and their corresponding regulatory pathways where identified. For all pathways contained within Bin i, genes related to that pathway where searched for in the remaining 99 bins. Any bins that contained a gene sharing a pathway with Bin i, were connected with a blue edge in the circular networking map. Similarly, any bin with a positive Bin:Bin interaction coefficient with respect to Bin i as determined from LASSO regression had a green edge drawn between those bins.
Polymer simulations were implemented in DL-POLY CLASSIC ( Todorov et al., 2006 50. Todorov, I.T. ∙ Smith, W. ∙ Trachenko, K. ... DL_POLY_3: new dimensions in molecular dynamics simulations via massive parallelism J. Mater. Chem. 2006; 16 :1911-1918 Crossref Scopus (937) Google Scholar ), using a chromosome with 965 beads (each representing roughly 4.8 kbp of DNA). Each bead had a covalent bond to its immediate neighbors treated using a restrained harmonic potential (rhrm in DL-POLY), with an equilibrium distance of 128 AU (arbitrary units), saturation distance of 500 AU, and force constant of 1.69 RT/AU. In addition, all beads interacted via a pairwise Lennard-Jones nonbonded potential, with ε = 0.84 RT and σ = 128 AU, with a 500 AU cutoff. Contacts were defined using a 250 AU cutoff unless otherwise noted.
Standard simulations were performed beginning from a circular conformation of the chromosome with an initial radius of 10,000 AU, and propagated under constant temperature conditions at 310 K using a Nose-Hoover thermostat. Simulations were performed using a nominal timestep of 10 ps, although the model is sufficiently coarse that the time is likewise better thought of as an arbitrary unit. Simulation durations were 25 million steps for non-crosslinking simulations, or 12.5 million steps for crosslinking simulations (as the latter were performed after the very short relaxation times of the systems had become apparent).
In the simulations emulating formaldehyde crosslinking, additional covalent bonds were added once every 50,000 steps, and had parameters equivalent to those of all other covalent bonds in the system. Each bond addition was constrained to only occur between beads within 250 AU of each other. In the case of simulations with pre-formed bonds between non-adjacent beads, the starting structure was perturbed by causing the radius of the circle to vary from 5,000 to 10,000 AU, with the minima occurring at the points of beads that were bonded to each other. An important consideration is that these simulations represent an extreme case in which the entire chromosome is in a fully extended/circular state at the precise moment when crosslinking begins. In an asynchronous population of cells, the more reasonable expectation would be that some fraction of the population would have their chromosomes in either a globally or locally extended conformation at the point when crosslinking begins, whereas the rest would be in an equilibrium structure (perhaps roughly resembling that in Figure 7 D, with additional off-diagonal contacts). In such a case, the contact map thus obtained by a 3C experiment would be a simple mixture of the contributions from cells that were in kinetically trapped versus equilibrium conformations at the time of crosslinking, with the equilibrium contribution becoming increasingly prominent for slower-growing cells.
For the simulations demonstrating the effects of MukBEF-like loop extrusion on relaxation times, we performed simulations for 400,000 steps beginning from a circular starting conformation, in which a new set of ‘loops’ was formed once every 5000 steps. Loop formation consisted of selecting a random set of 20 or 40 bead pairs, among beads that were separated by two to five bonds. Over the next 5000 step leg of the simulation, each of those bead pairs were subject to an additional attractive force of magnitude 53900/ r 2 RT/AU, with r the distance between the beads in AU. The attractive force between two nearby but nonadjacent beads serves here as a crude model of loop extrusion, in which a chromosomal region between two anchor points would be expected to be ‘looped out’ from the anchor formed by those points. For the purposes of Figures 7 E and 7F, the mixing state of the chromosome was analyzed by fitting a logistic regression at each simulation snapshot for the fraction of possible contacts formed at each linear genomic distance, as a function of the natural logarithm of that distance; the fitted distance dependence coefficient was used to assess the formation of local versus long-distance contacts. Because the decay curves could not be fitted by a simple exponential ( Figure 7 E), a nonparameteric approach was used to identify the relaxation rates, defining the asymptotic value reached by the interaction coefficient as the median observed over the last 10% of the simulation, and then define the decay time τ 1.1 as the time required for the coefficient to reach a value within 10% of the asymptotic value. Note that even if the same threshold (that required for the +MukBEF cases) were applied for all simulations, the observed values of τ 1.1 for the with-MukBEF cases are still on average less than half of those for the no-MukBEF cases (data not shown).
While numerous other groups have presented models of the chromosomes of E. coli and other bacteria at varying resolutions ( Umbarger et al., 2011; Jung et al., 2012; Le et al., 2013; Hacker et al., 2017; Yildirim and Feig, 2018 16.

High-resolution 3D models of Caulobacter crescentus chromosome reveal genome structural variability and organization Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :3937-3952 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), in general the focus both of explicit modeling efforts and of mental models implicit in explanations of chromosomal structure has been on equilibrium states. One notable exception is the work of Jung and colleagues ( Jung et al., 2012 21. Jung, Y. ∙ Jeon, C. ∙ Kim, J. ... Ring polymers as model bacterial chromosomes: confinement, chain topology, single chain statistics, and how they interact Soft Matter. 2012; 8 :2095-2102 Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar ) who studied both relaxation kinetics and equilibrium structure of model chromosomes using a ring polymer model similar to that employed here. Several important distinctions between the assumptions in the models, however, lead to substantially different conclusions regarding the E. coli chromosome; the model of Jung and colleagues treats the chromosomal components as purely repulsive spheres interacting with both each other and a confining cylinder (the latter providing compaction), whereas here compaction is treated as arising implicitly from weak attractive forces between beads, without a confining shell (the attractive forces in the present model simply act as a stand-in for confinement by the cell membrane, protein factors promoting nucleoid compaction, and exclusion of ribosomes and other non-DNA cellular components). Perhaps a more important difference, Jung et al. model the E. coli chromosome with fewer beads which are relatively large compared with the diameter of the cylindrical confining shell (D = 4.8 bead radii); as a result, the chromosome in their model using E. coli -like parameters is forced into a linearly ordered conformation along the length of the cell, which is incompatible with the well-mixed conformation implied by the Mu transposition data. In contrast, the polymer model employed here provides an equilibrium state that is consistent with the qualitative features of our contact maps, a purely kinetic explanation for the effects of loss of MukB function, and additional insight into possible causes for the differences between contact maps observed via Mu transposition and HiC-like approaches.
It is also essential to note, in our consideration of both the kinetic and equilibrium properties of chromosomal conformations, that the ‘well-mixed’ property of the chromosome demonstrated by the Mu transposition data arises purely at the population level, and does not bear any requirements on the speed of Mu transposition or diffusion of Mu-containing loci. Indeed, the diffusive mobility of Mu-containing loci does not differ substantially from that of bulk DNA ( Video S2 ), ruling out the possibility that the observed contact map arises due to some superdiffusive motion of the Mu-integrated locus itself. Instead, both the experimental and theoretical contact maps shown here arise due to averaging of the conformations of large numbers of cells – in any individual cell, a particular Mu origin location will only have access to the relatively small number of other chromosomal loci that it is in contact with over the timescale required for expression and assembly of MuA. The ‘small-world’ property of the Mu contact maps arises because over an ensemble of cells, a Mu donor site will be found with roughly even frequencies to be in contact with any particular other part of the chromosome (with the exception of the specific instances of clustering considered elsewhere in the text).
In order to assess the robustness and applicability of the polymer model simulations employed here, a series of trajectories was generated in which the well depth of the main Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential was scanned through a 1000-fold range of values (see Figure S7 D). Three rough domains of behavior are apparent: at low interaction potential strengths, the system is never driven to form noncovalent interactions at any meaningful rate, and thus the contact map is dominated by the diagonal. At a well depth of ∼0.5 RT, the system appears to undergo a phase transition into a well-mixed state, in which any given locus can interact randomly with any other locus. This state shows the presence of a compact nucleoid, but is flexible and permits rapid conformational search. As the well depth continues to increase, the system undergoes a second phase transition to a glassy state in which the contact map is dominated by nearby neighbors, due to either kinetic or thermodynamic trapping into a state where only local contacts (those between nearby beads) are formed with any regularity. The relatively dynamic behavior of the middle phase relative to the glassy high-LJ phase can be further demonstrated by taking a collection of conformations from the medium-LJ state and switching them to the high-LJ state and vice versa ( Figure S7 E); the high-LJ state remains trapped near its starting conformations and thus retains the well-mixed initial conditions inherited from the initial conditions, whereas switching high-LJ conformations to the middle-LJ state causes rapid transition to a well-mixed conformation. Thus, the high-LJ state undergoes little meaningful motion over the timescales simulated here, raising the strong possibility that the short-range contact maps observed for high LJ constants in Figure S7 D are primarily due to trapping in the first conformation taken on by the system after initial collapse.
Of the regimes explored here, the middle one appears most appropriate for coarse modeling of the E. coli nucleoid due to several considerations: It is compacted (as the nucleoid should be) yet flexible and dynamic (again as the nucleoid should be); the phases occurring with weaker or stronger values of the Lennard-Jones force constant represent either severely decondensed structures, or those for which the chromosome is essentially static. To maintain consistency with both the Mu experimental data and the general desiderata outlined above, we use a well depth of 0.84 RT in all other simulations presented in this work, squarely in the middle of the well-mixed phase of the system.
Several simulation studies have recently demonstrated that processive loop extrusion activities akin to those suspected of MukBEF can enhance chromosome compaction and dynamic processes such as segregation ( Goloborodko et al., 2016 15. Goloborodko, A. ∙ Imakaev, M.V. ∙ Marko, J.F. ... Compaction and segregation of sister chromatids via active loop extrusion eLife. 2016; 5 :e14864 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ), and that its activity in E. coli likely plays a major role in the specific compacted structure taken on by the nucleoid ( Mäkelä and Sherratt, 2019 32. Mäkelä, J. ∙ Sherratt, D.J. The SMC complex, MukBEF, organizes the Escherichia coli chromosome by forming an axial core bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). For the purposes of the present model, MukBEF activity was treated in a more coarse-grained fashion, in which loops encompassing up to six beads were formed (by adding an attractive potential between the beads at the base of the loop) and subsequently broken. Two prominent effects on the behavior of the modeled nucleoid were apparent: the kinetics of relaxation from a fully extended state toward a small-world like state were substantially accelerated ( Figures 7 E and 7F), but conversely, the asymptotic distance dependence of contact rates was somewhat stronger in the presence of MukBEF activity than in its absence, with values for the fitted distance dependence over the last 10% of 400,000 step simulations of around −1.1 in the absence of MukBEF loop extrusion, or −3.0 in its presence. The latter finding is consistent with other simulation studies demonstrating that loop extrusion can contribute to chromosomal domain formation ( Fudenberg et al., 2016 12. Fudenberg, G. ∙ Imakaev, M. ∙ Lu, C. ... Formation of Chromosomal Domains by Loop Extrusion Cell Rep. 2016; 15 :2038-2049 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1116) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as the intuitive expectation that a protein complex promoting cohesion between nearby portions of the chromosome would promote local contacts. The experimental finding that MukBEF activity is in fact necessary for the formation of a well-mixed chromosome, and that in the absence of MukBEF short-range contacts predominate, is counter-intuitive when considered only from the standpoint of the final structures that might be reached in the presence versus absence of MukB. This finding can be understood as arising either due to acceleration of relaxation of the chromosome away from more extended states and toward better mixed states (the kinetic model proposed in the Main Text) and thus raises the fraction of the population that is able to form long range contacts, the possibility that in the absence of MukBEF the chromosome is too diffuse to form any detectable contacts (as in the low LJ regime of Figure S7 D), or some interplay not captured in our simple model between MukBEF and other chromosomal organizing factors.
Mu locations were identified using the custom software entitled Mu Analysis of Positions from Sequencing (MAPS). In short, MAPS identifies the transposition sites for Mu the genomic sequence by aligning the genomic sequencing fastq files to both to the MG1655 genome from GenBank (GenBank: U00096.3) and the Mu phage genome (GenBank: AF083977.1) using BWA tools. PCR duplicates are discarded using SAMTOOLS. Reads corresponding to both MG1655 and either of the Mu ends are pulled from the alignment files for further processing. This pool of sequences were then aligned once again with BWA against the MG1655 genome. The lowest value nucleotide of the MG1655 genome observed before transitioning into the Mu genome was taken to be the location of insertion. The average error in estimating Mu location sites is estimated to be around 300 bp as that is the average template length created during sequencing library preparation. Nearly 50% of all Mu locations sampled correspond to the location of the initial prophage, confirming that Mu has transposed only once in the initial induction experiment.
We performed penalized Poisson regression using the R package glmnet ( Friedman et al., 2010 11. Friedman, J. ∙ Hastie, T. ∙ Tibshirani, R. Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent J. Stat. Softw. 2010; 33 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (10856) PubMed Google Scholar ) to fit the observed interaction counts for all bin-bin pairs in each dataset. The model incorporated indicator variables for each bin of origin, destination bin, and bin-bin interaction pair, as well as a regression parameter accounting for genomic distance on the genome (expressed as d = log(1+ l ), for l the distance in bins between the source and destination of the Mu phage). In addition, to each count bin c i,j representing the transition count from bin i to bin j , an offset term of log( q i ∗ q j ) was included, where q i is the relative abundance of genomic material from bin i in an untargeted sequencing experiment, thus accounting for any effects on Mu transposition frequencies arising solely from the relative abundances of different donor and acceptor bins (that is, the products of the bin abundances are treated as an exposure term). Thus, the overall form of the model for the number of transpositions from any bin i to any other bin j, c i,j , is given by 𝑐 𝑖 , 𝑗 ∼ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ ( α 𝑖 , 𝑗 + 𝛽 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑡 + β 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑖 , 𝑗 + β 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑖 + β 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑜 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑗 + β 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) (1) Here α i,j represents the abundance constant described above, d i,j is the log-scaled distance between bins i and j as described above, and the β values are regression parameters to be fitted. The β i , j terms are defined such that i and j are order-independent, forcing the interaction matrix to be symmetric; interaction terms are only defined for bin pairs for which at least one bin is a Mu donor. The penalized log-likelihood 1 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁡ ( 𝜷 | ⁢ 𝑫 ) + 𝜆 ⁢ ∑ 𝑁 𝑘 = 1 | 𝛽 𝑘 | (2) was maximized in order to obtain the fitted β coefficients, where L represents the Poisson likelihood, D are the observed count data and known independent variables, and N is the total number of free parameters (all β values appearing in Equation 1 above). We used 100-fold cross validation (as implemented in the cv.glmnet function) to identify optimal values for the penalty parameter λ, and report the fit with the highest (most restrictive) value for λ yielding a cross-validated deviance within 1 standard error of the best fit; results of this fitted model are shown in the text. The processed data serving as input to the model fit (all_interaction_counts_withnorm.csv), as well as the R code used to implement the model (run_classic_lasso.R), are available from the project Github page.
Analysis of individual foci tracking was done using a custom python script (spot_detect.py). In brief: for a field of cells, foci where isolated by increasing Otsu threshold ( Otsu, 1979 41. Otsu, N. Threshold Selection Method from Gray-Level Histograms IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybern. 1979; 9 :62-66 Crossref Google Scholar ) on each channel for GFP or CFP. The positional information for each set of foci were calculated. For each GFP the nearest CFP distance was calculated and stored. Histograms of the distances between GFP and CFP were generated to visualize the distribution of distances for a given population of cells. Image fields were restricted to those containing between 120 and 200 cells for analysis. For nucleoid tracking acting on the DAPI channel, cells were segmented by calculating the Otsu threshold ( Otsu, 1979 41. Otsu, N. Threshold Selection Method from Gray-Level Histograms IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybern. 1979; 9 :62-66 Crossref Google Scholar ) and merging contiguous regions exceeding that threshold (using tools from the mahotas library ( Coelho, 2013 6. Coelho, L.P. Mahotas: Open source software for scriptable computer vision J. Open Res. Softw. 2013; 1 :e32013 Google Scholar )). Image fields which were too dense to segment using this method were discarded. Statistics were calculated for all regions (objects) called via the approach above. To exclude ‘cells’ consisting of severely out-of-plane portions or objects containing multiple cells, the principal axes for each called object were calculated, as well as the cell’s maximum extent along those axes. Only objects with a length of at least 2.8 μm along their long axis, and between 313 nm and 1.56 μm along the short axis, were included in the bulk analysis shown in Figure S6 .
