Title: Aralar Sequesters GABA into Hyperactive Mitochondria, Causing Social Behavior Deficits


Abstract: Summary

Social impairment is frequently associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and altered neurotransmission. Although mitochondrial function is crucial for brain homeostasis, it remains unknown whether mitochondrial disruption contributes to social behavioral deficits. Here, we show that Drosophila mutants in the homolog of the human CYFIP1 , a gene linked to autism and schizophrenia, exhibit mitochondrial hyperactivity and altered group behavior. We identify the regulation of GABA availability by mitochondrial activity as a biologically relevant mechanism and demonstrate its contribution to social behavior. Specifically, increased mitochondrial activity causes gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) sequestration in the mitochondria, reducing GABAergic signaling and resulting in social deficits. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of mitochondrial activity or GABA signaling corrects the observed abnormalities. We identify Aralar as the mitochondrial transporter that sequesters GABA upon increased mitochondrial activity. This study increases our understanding of how mitochondria modulate neuronal homeostasis and social behavior under physiopathological conditions.

Section: Introduction

Human brain, which account for just 2% of body weight, uses 20% of all mitochondrial energy ( Castro et al., 2018; Mergenthaler et al., 2013 33. Castro, J.P. ∙ Wardelmann, K. ∙ Grune, T. ...

To fulfill these energy requirements, mitochondria supply neurons with energy by generating metabolites via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) ( Hollis et al., 2017; Vos et al., 2010 68.

Neurons rely on mitochondrial function for a variety of processes, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmission ( Kann and Kovács, 2007; Khacho and Slack, 2018; Li et al., 2004; Marland et al., 2016; Raefsky and Mattson, 2017; Schwarz, 2013; Vos et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012 74.

Furthermore, mitochondria regulate calcium buffering, controlling release of neurotransmitters from neurons and ensuring proper synaptic functioning ( Williams et al., 2013 156.

Converging lines of evidence support a role of mitochondria in brain dysfunctions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and other disabilities featuring synaptic dysfunctions ( Castora, 2019; De Rubeis et al., 2014; Gandal et al., 2018; García-Cazorla et al., 2018; Hollis et al., 2017 32.

A positive correlation between mitochondrial complex I and III mRNA levels has also been reported in SCZ ( Akarsu et al., 2014; Taurines et al., 2010 2. Akarsu, S. ∙ Torun, D. ∙ Bolu, A. ...

Psychiatry. 2016; 61 :457-469 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), but other studies have shown the opposite; namely, impaired mitochondrial network dynamics associated with reduced cellular respiration and complex I abnormalities in SCZ ( Rosenfeld et al., 2011 119.

Psychiatry. 2011; 69 :980-988 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, clinical studies have noted metabolic disturbances, including mitochondrial dysfunction at the levels of mtDNA, activity, atypical redox metabolism, and differences in metabolites in patients with ASD and SCZ ( Hollis et al., 2017; Konradi and Öngür, 2017; Patowary et al., 2017 68. Hollis, F. ∙ Kanellopoulos, A.K. ∙ Bagni, C. Mitochondrial dysfunction in Autism Spectrum Disorder: clinical features and perspectives Curr. Opin.

Next Generation Sequencing Mitochondrial DNA Analysis in Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism Res. 2017; 10 :1338-1343 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mitochondrial genes have been reported to be differentially expressed in the cerebral cortex of ASD patients and strongly correlated with genes associated with synaptic transmission ( Schwede et al., 2018 127. Schwede, M. ∙ Nagpal, S. ∙ Gandal, M.J. ... Strong correlation of downregulated genes related to synaptic transmission and mitochondria in post-mortem autism cerebral cortex J. Neurodev. Disord. 2018; 10 :18 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), and in SCZ, disruptions in mitochondria have been found in different brain regions, cell types, and subcellular locations ( Konradi and Öngür, 2017 78. Konradi, C. ∙ Öngür, D. Role of mitochondria and energy metabolism in schizophrenia and psychotic disorders Schizophr. Res. 2017; 187 :1-2 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, a human whole-genome methylation study revealed that two crucial biological processes, mitochondrial metabolism and protein ubiquitination, are associated with ASD brains ( Stathopoulos et al., 2018 138. Stathopoulos, S. ∙ Gaujoux, R. ∙ O’Ryan, C. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in Autism Spectrum Disorder and mitochondrial function bioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). In agreement, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed significant enrichment for ASD- and SCZ-associated common variants in genes that regulate synapse and mitochondrial homeostasis ( Gandal et al., 2018 59. Gandal, M.J. ∙ Haney, J.R. ∙ Parikshak, N.N. ..., CommonMind Consortium, PsychENCODE Consortium, iPSYCH-BROAD Working Group Shared molecular neuropathology across major psychiatric disorders parallels polygenic overlap Science. 2018; 359 :693-697 Crossref Scopus (579) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these studies suggest a potential association between energetic balance, synaptic transmission, and psychiatric disease, the functional significance of mitochondrial disturbances for neurological disease and the mechanistic links between these processes remain unclear.
Copy number variations (CNVs) and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the cytoplasmic FMR1 -interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1) gene have been associated with SCZ and ASD ( Leblond et al., 2012; Stefansson et al., 2014; Tam et al., 2010; Vanlerberghe et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2013 82.

Among the four implicated genes, converging evidence suggests that CYFIP1 is a key factor mediating risk for the BP1-2-deletion disorders ( Das et al., 2015; Nebel et al., 2016; Vanlerberghe et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2016; Yoon et al., 2014 42.

CYFIP1 has a dual role in the brain, regulating local protein synthesis by binding eIF4E and controlling actin remodeling as part of the hetero-pentameric wave regulatory complex (WRC) ( Anitei et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010b; De Rubeis et al., 2013; Di Marino et al., 2015; Eden et al., 2002; Genheden et al., 2015; Hsiao et al., 2016; Napoli et al., 2008; Oguro-Ando et al., 2015; Panja et al., 2014; Pathania et al., 2014; Schenck et al., 2003; Stradal and Scita, 2006 7.

Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that CYFIP1 haploinsufficiency in humans, rodents, and flies confers domain-specific cognitive impairments and behavioral deficits ( Bachmann et al., 2019; Bozdagi et al., 2012; Domínguez-Iturza et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2019; Woo et al., 2019 13.

Domain-specific cognitive impairments in humans and flies with reduced CYFIP1 dosage Biol. Psychiatry. 2019; 86 :306-314 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the molecular mechanisms linking CYFIP1 deficiency with alterations in behavior and cognition remain unknown.
Here we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying social behaviors in Drosophila , demonstrating a mechanistic link between alterations in mitochondrial metabolism, neuronal communication, and social behavior. By using CYFIP haploinsufficient flies, we show that an increase in mitochondrial activity, energy metabolism, and membrane potential causes abnormal gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling, leading to deficits in social group interactions in flies. Furthermore, we identify the solute carrier Aralar as the mitochondrial transporter responsible for uptake of GABA into mitochondria, which is activated by mitochondrial membrane polarization. We provide genetic, biochemical, pharmacological, and morphological evidence that explains how dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis regulates GABA signaling and the social component of behavior.

CYFIP haploinsufficiency in humans and flies has been shown recently to confer domain-specific cognitive impairments ( Woo et al., 2019 159. Woo, Y.J. ∙ Kanellopoulos, A.K. ∙ Hemati, P. ... Domain-specific cognitive impairments in humans and flies with reduced CYFIP1 dosage Biol. Psychiatry. 2019; 86 :306-314 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because increasing evidence points toward a role of CYFIP1 in ASD- and SCZ-like behaviors ( Domínguez-Iturza et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2019 50. Domínguez-Iturza, N. ∙ Lo, A.C. ∙ Shah, D. ... The autism- and schizophrenia-associated protein CYFIP1 regulates bilateral brain connectivity and behaviour Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3454 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar 130.

Commun. 2019; 10 :3455 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), and given the prevalence of social deficits in these disorders, we investigated whether CYFIP haploinsufficiency affects ASD-like behaviors by comparing Cyfip 85.1 /+ ( Schenck et al., 2003 124. Schenck, A. ∙ Bardoni, B. ∙ Langmann, C. ... CYFIP/Sra-1 controls neuronal connectivity in Drosophila and links the Rac1 GTPase pathway to the fragile X protein Neuron. 2003; 38 :887-898 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ) and control flies in well-established paradigms for social group behavior. First, male flies were tested in a food competition assay ( Anholt and Mackay, 2012; Zwarts et al., 2011 6. Anholt, R.R. ∙ Mackay, T.F. Genetics of aggression Annu. Rev. Genet. 2012; 46 :145-164 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar 172. Zwarts, L. ∙ Magwire, M.M. ∙ Carbone, M.A. ... Complex genetic architecture of Drosophila aggressive behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :17070-17075 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), where the index of approaches was used to obtain an average of the total number of social events in a 2-min time frame. Cyfip 85.1 /+ male flies showed a reduced number of social events relative to control flies ( Figure 1 A; Video S1 ). This also holds true for female flies ( Figure S1 A). Second, Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies were further investigated by observing Drosophila courtship, a complex innate social behavior in flies ( Ejima and Griffith, 2007; Sokolowski, 2010 53. Ejima, A. ∙ Griffith, L.C. Measurement of Courtship Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster CSH Protoc. 2007; 2007 pdb.prot4847 PubMed Google Scholar 134. Sokolowski, M.B. Social interactions in “simple” model systems Neuron. 2010; 65 :780-794 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cyfip 85.1 /+ male flies showed a decreased courtship index toward a control female ( Figure 1 B; Video S2 ). Third, we monitored the grooming behavior of individual flies as described previously ( Tauber et al., 2011 143. Tauber, J.M. ∙ Vanlandingham, P.A. ∙ Zhang, B. Elevated levels of the vesicular monoamine transporter and a novel repetitive behavior in the Drosophila model of fragile X syndrome PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e27100 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cyfip 85.1 /+ male flies showed excess grooming behavior in comparison with control flies ( Figure 1 C; Video S3 ), suggesting an increase in repetitive behavior. Moreover, we recorded the behavior of flies within a social group, measuring the distance between two flies as social space ( Simon et al., 2012 131. Simon, A.F. ∙ Chou, M.T. ∙ Salazar, E.D. ... A simple assay to study social behavior in Drosophila: measurement of social space within a group Genes Brain Behav. 2012; 11 :243-252 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies, on average, showed greater distances to the nearest neighbor fly compared with control flies within a group ( Figure 1 D), further confirming the social interaction impairment of Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies. In addition, Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies stayed farther away from the wall of the open field arena ( Figure 1 D), indicating disruption of their natural thigmotactic behavior (attraction to the contact of the wall) ( Besson and Martin, 2005 22. Besson, M. ∙ Martin, J.R. Centrophobism/thigmotaxis, a new role for the mushroom bodies in Drosophila J. Neurobiol. 2005; 62 :386-396 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies exhibit hyperactivity over 24 h compared with controls ( Figure S1 B), but no differences in locomotion activity were observed during the daytime (Zeitgeber time, ZT0–ZT6) ( Figure S1 C), the time frame when the social assays were performed. This indicates that hyperactivity does not interfere with our social behavioral assays and that the observed social deficits were not due to impaired motor ability. C yfip mutant flies (males and females) do not differ from controls ( Figures S1 D and S1E) in negative geotaxis as a measure of motor reflex ( Sun et al., 2018 141. Sun, J. ∙ Xu, A.Q. ∙ Giraud, J. ... Neural Control of Startle-Induced Locomotion by the Mushroom Bodies and Associated Neurons in Drosophila Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2018; 12 :6 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), anxiety ( Garcia and Teets, 2019 60. Garcia, M.J. ∙ Teets, N.M. Cold stress results in sustained locomotor and behavioral deficits in Drosophila melanogaster J. Exp. Zool. A Ecol. Integr. Physiol. 2019; 331 :192-200 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), or startle response ( Zhang et al., 2002 168. Zhang, H. ∙ Tan, J. ∙ Reynolds, E. ... The Drosophila slamdance gene: a mutation in an aminopeptidase can cause seizure, paralysis and neuronal failure Genetics. 2002; 162 :1283-1299 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, we used the Temporal and Regional Gene Expression Targeting (TARGET) system to interrogate specific effects of C yfip knockdown by transgenic RNAi (upstream activation sequence [UAS]- C yfip -IR) expression in the adult animal ( McGuire et al., 2003 91. McGuire, S.E. ∙ Le, P.T. ∙ Osborn, A.J. ... Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila Science. 2003; 302 :1765-1768 Crossref Scopus (967) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pan-neuronal attenuation of C yfip mRNA levels in adult flies ( Figure S1 F) phenocopied the decreased competition for food in Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutant animals ( Figure S1 G). The decreased social score in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies was fully rescued by expression, in adulthood only, of a transgene harboring the wild-type C yfip (UAS-C yfip -wild-type [WT]/genetic rescue) ( Figure S1 G). These data provide evidence that CYFIP is required for proper social behavior in adult flies.

Grooming Behavior in Control and Cyfip85.1/+ Flies, Related to Figure 1
To identify the molecular mechanism underlying the observed behavioral dysfunctions in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies, we performed tandem mass spectrometry in control and Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutant brains. Analysis identified a total of 345 dysregulated proteins, of which 309 were present at greater abundance and 36 at lower abundance in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies compared with controls ( Table S1 ). The identified proteins corresponded to 361 fly genes and mapped with high confidence to 264 human orthologs (i.e., 73%). Fly protein-protein interaction (PPI) and cluster networks were then constructed by mining publicly available databases: FlyBase ( Attrill et al., 2016 12. Attrill, H. ∙ Falls, K. ∙ Goodman, J.L. ..., FlyBase Consortium FlyBase: establishing a Gene Group resource for Drosophila melanogaster Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D786-D792 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ), BioGRID, IntAct, BIND, DIP ( Salwinski et al., 2004 122. Salwinski, L. ∙ Miller, C.S. ∙ Smith, A.J. ... The Database of Interacting Proteins: 2004 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :D449-D451 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and MINT ( Salwinski et al., 2004 122. Salwinski, L. ∙ Miller, C.S. ∙ Smith, A.J. ... The Database of Interacting Proteins: 2004 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :D449-D451 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 A). The strongest signal recovered in these network-based analyses was for the community of mitochondrial proteins (community 3, p = 2.4 × 10 −6 , permutated p < 1%). This mitochondrial signal was likewise one of the top hits in the Gene Ontology analysis, identifying differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins ( Figure 2 B; Table S2 ) and highlighting dysregulation of the TCA cycle, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial electron transport as well as neurotransmitter release-related processes ( Figure 2 C; Figure S2 ). Further, disease-related analyses identified a highly significant overrepresentation of gene networks implicated in SCZ, dementia, and syndromic epilepsy ( Figure 2 D).
Given that our proteomics analysis suggested a role of mitochondria and energy metabolism in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies, we assessed whether the mutant flies showed alterations in mitochondrial respiration. Using high-resolution respirometry, we observed a striking increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity through the respiratory chain in Cyfip 85.1 /+ brains ( Figure 3 A), both at the level of coupled respiration through complexes I and II (complex I [CI] and complex I+II [CI+II]) and at the level of maximal electron transfer (ET) capacity (CI+II ET) ( Figure 3 B). The respiration differences appear to be driven mostly by CI and complex IV (COX) ( Figure 3 B). In contrast, no alterations were observed in oxygen consumption in Cyfip 85.1 /+ fly bodies ( Figure 3 C), suggesting that mitochondrial activity is specifically dysregulated in the CNS. Labeling brains with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), an established marker for mitochondrial membrane potential ( Perry et al., 2011 112. Perry, S.W. ∙ Norman, J.P. ∙ Barbieri, J. ... Mitochondrial membrane potential probes and the proton gradient: a practical usage guide Biotechniques. 2011; 50 :98-115 Crossref Scopus (809) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealed increased signal intensity in Cyfip 85.1 /+ brains, further suggesting that the flies exhibit increased mitochondrial membrane potential ( Figure 3 D). This finding was also confirmed by Rhodamine 123 staining ( Figure S3 A). No differences were observed in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial protein levels between Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants and controls ( Figure 3 E; Figures S3 B and S3C). We used another widely used marker of mitochondrial protein mass, citrate synthase (CS) activity ( Spinazzi et al., 2012 136. Spinazzi, M. ∙ Casarin, A. ∙ Pertegato, V. ... Assessment of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymatic activities on tissues and cultured cells Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :1235-1246 Crossref Scopus (615) PubMed Google Scholar ). CS activity in Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants was not altered compared with control brains ( Figure S3 D). Next, mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in fly brains from both genotypes, and a remarkable difference was observed in the mutant flies. Mitochondrion area and perimeter were increased in Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutant flies versus controls ( Figure 3 F). The higher metabolic rate of Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies is not due to higher food consumption because feeding during the daytime ( Figure S3 E) and over 24 h ( Figure S3 F) were not altered. In conclusion, these data reveal that the mitochondrial activity and size are increased in Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutant flies.
The high enrichment of proteins relating to mitochondrial function (OXPHOS and TCA cycle) in the mass spectrometry dataset ( Figure S2 ) and the demonstration of increased mitochondrial respiration in the Cyfip 85.1 /+ fly brain prompted us to investigate whether Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies have any changes in the TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid or Krebs cycle). First, TCA metabolites ( Figure 4 A) were determined by stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) from Cyfip 85.1 /+ brains. Of the metabolites that are produced in the TCA cycle itself, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate [α-KG]/2-oxoglutarate, and succinate levels are increased in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies, indicating that enzymatic activities in this section of the cycle are higher ( Figure 4 B). Of note, α-KG and isocitrate dehydrogenase generate NADH, providing electron equivalents to CI, and succinate fuels complex II, suggesting that upregulation of the TCA cycle is responsible for the increased CI activity we observed in the Cyfip 85.1 /+ brain ( Figure 3 B; Maguire et al., 2015 88. Maguire, S.E. ∙ Rhoades, S. ∙ Chen, W.F. ... Independent Effects of γ-Aminobutyric Acid Transaminase (GABAT) on Metabolic and Sleep Homeostasis J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :20407-20416 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Examination of the MS data further validated that the levels of NADH-producing enzymes, specifically the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) ( Yoon et al., 2017 165. Yoon, W.H. ∙ Sandoval, H. ∙ Nagarkar-Jaiswal, S. ... Loss of Nardilysin, a Mitochondrial Co-chaperone for α-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase, Promotes mTORC1 Activation and Neurodegeneration Neuron. 2017; 93 :115-131 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ) and α-KG hydroxylase, are indeed upregulated, as indicated by the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis ( Table S2 ). NAD-IDH activity increased 3-fold in Cyfip 85.1 /+ brains compared with controls ( Figure 4 C), and the activity of α-KG-dependent hydroxylase was also significantly increased in Cyfip 85.1 /+ brains ( Figure 4 D). Interestingly, the total levels of oxidized and reduced forms of NAD (NADt; NAD + and NADH) were not altered between Cyfip 85.1 /+ and controls in isolated mitochondria ( Figure 4 E); however, the reduced form (NADH) had a significantly higher level ( Figure 4 F). Tracing of 13 C-labeled glucose shows a drastic increase in isotope-labeled succinate in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies, whereas incorporation of the 13 C label into to malate and citrate/isocitrate was not changed ( Figure 4 G). This confirms that the biochemical reactions between citrate/isocitrate and succinate (i.e., IDH and αKG) are overactive and shows that TCA cycle overactivity is fueled by glycolysis. Further analysis of the amino acid composition using stable isotope tracing as well as hydrophilic interaction LC coupled to tandem MS (HILIC-MS/MS) revealed higher levels of amino acids related to the TCA cycle in Cyfip 85.1 /+ brains ( Figures S4 A and S4B). These findings confirm that the Cyfip 85.1 /+ brain shows increased TCA cycle and CI activity.
Given that Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies have altered social behaviors and increased mitochondrial respiration, we tested whether the alterations in mitochondrial function were causally involved in mediating the behaviors seen in the Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies. We normalized energy production by reducing IDH activity to partially inhibit the TCA cycle. Using i dh3a mutant flies, which have decreased IDH activity and reduced α-KG levels ( Ugur et al., 2017 148. Ugur, B. ∙ Bao, H. ∙ Stawarski, M. ... The Krebs Cycle Enzyme Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 3A Couples Mitochondrial Metabolism to Synaptic Transmission Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :3794-3806 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that social behavior in the food competition assay was reduced in idh3a /+ flies and that idh3a /+ ;Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies behaved as the controls ( Figure 5 A). Further, pharmacological inhibition of IDH activity using ML309, a selective inhibitor of IDH that effectively lowers the production of α-KG levels ( Davis et al., 2014 44. Davis, M.I. ∙ Gross, S. ∙ Shen, M. ... Biochemical, cellular, and biophysical characterization of a potent inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH1 J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 :13717-13725 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), also ameliorated the abnormal social behavior in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies ( Figure 5 B). Interestingly, idh3a /+ single mutation or overexpression of IDH in the fly brain ( Figure 5 C) showed a reduction in social behavior similar to Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies, suggesting that too much and too little energy production lead to a social behavioral defect. Importantly, the ML309 compound also restored the increased mitochondrial activity in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies ( Figure 5 D). These results demonstrate a surprising association of social behavior with the TCA cycle and highlight the importance of the IDH enzyme as a potential therapeutic target.
We next designed an experiment to test whether dampening mitochondrial activity and mitochondrial membrane potential can normalize social behavior. Control and Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies were fed rotenone (an inhibitor of CI) for 4 days at a concentration approximately 500 times lower than that used to model Parkinson' disease in flies. Although this treatment had no effect on the behavior of control flies ( Figure S4 C), we found that it ameliorates social deficits in Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants ( Figure 5 E) after 4 days of feeding. The effect of rotenone treatment was reversible ( Figure S4 D). Of note, the same treatment did not restore the hyperactivity of Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants ( Figure S4 E), suggesting that the mitochondrial phenotype is specific to social behavior. Moreover, reducing CI activity by crossing Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies to flies with a genetic reduction in CI activity ( Pink1 B9 /+ mutants; Morais et al., 2009 97. Morais, V.A. ∙ Verstreken, P. ∙ Roethig, A. ... Parkinson’s disease mutations in PINK1 result in decreased Complex I activity and deficient synaptic function EMBO Mol. Med. 2009; 1 :99-111 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ) also rescued social behavior to levels that were indistinguishable from controls ( Figure 5 F). As for the Idh 3a mutant, Pink1 B9 /+ flies exhibited social deficits similar to those seen in Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants. Finally, western blot analysis revealed that Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants harbored increased levels of the mitochondrial CI subunit NDUFS3 ( Figure S3 B), consistent with the MS data. Assessments of ndufs3/+ mutant flies, harboring a mutation affecting mitochondrial CI, also uncovered abnormal social behavior in these flies, whereas the double ndufs3 /+ ;Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants were normal with regard to number of social interactions ( Figure 5 F). Combined, these results point to a causal role of mitochondria and energy metabolism in the regulation of a complex social behavior.
Excitation/inhibition balance in microcircuitries plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders with shared social deficits ( Benke and Möhler, 2018; Boccuto et al., 2013; Brambilla et al., 2003; Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Coghlan et al., 2012; Edden et al., 2012; Friedman et al., 2003; Kuo and Liu, 2019; Mukherjee et al., 2019; Robinson and Gradinaru, 2018; Zoghbi and Bear, 2012 20.

Synaptic dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with autism and intellectual disabilities Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4 :3 Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar ). In both in ASD and SCZ, there is differential expression of mitochondrial genes in different brain regions, cell types, and subcellular locations ( Konradi and Öngür, 2017 78. Konradi, C. ∙ Öngür, D. Role of mitochondria and energy metabolism in schizophrenia and psychotic disorders Schizophr. Res. 2017; 187 :1-2 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, to determine whether a specific cell type is responsible for the deficit in Cyfip 85.1 /+ social behavior, we knocked down CYFIP individually in both major excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons ( Hsu and Bhandawat, 2016; Kolodziejczyk et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2003 71.

Female contact modulates male aggression via a sexually dimorphic GABAergic circuit in Drosophila Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :81-88 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). No effect on social behavior was observed when CYFIP levels were reduced in cholinergic neurons ( Figure 6 A). However, depletion of CYFIP in GABAergic neurons recapitulated the feeding-dependent socialization defect seen in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies ( Figure 6 B), and this could be rescued by genetic reintroduction of Cyfip . Attenuation of C yfip mRNA levels specifically in GABAergic neurons was confirmed ( Figure S5 A).
The Drosophila brain contains around a thousand well-mapped GABAergic neurons responsible for distinct behaviors ( Figure S5 B). This allowed us to further investigate possible defects in the GABAergic system by assessing subsets of GABAergic neurons sensitive to C yfip dosage. To do so, the GAL4 system was used to deplete CYFIP individually in three distinct GABAergic interneuron subtypes: in anterior paired lateral (APL) neurons (a single GABAergic neuron per brain hemisphere that innervates the ipsilateral mushroom bodies [MBs] through broad projections; Liu and Davis, 2009; Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2011 87.

Reducing CYFIP levels in APL neurons or LNs recapitulated the behavioral deficits observed with pan-neuronal or pan-GABAergic knockdown, whereas no effect was observed for the DPM neurons ( Figure 6 C).
Given the sensitivity of GABAergic cells to C yfip dosage, we investigated vesicular GABA levels in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies. Immunohistochemistry experiments ( Homberg and Müller, 2016; Tochitani and Kondo, 2013 69. Homberg, U. ∙ Müller, M.

To address whether such a reduction was due to a pre- or post-synaptic phenotype, we monitored synaptic transmission in GABAergic neurons. By expressing UAS-synaptopHluorin ( Ng et al., 2002 103.

Transmission of olfactory information between three populations of neurons in the antennal lobe of the fly Neuron. 2002; 36 :463-474 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ) in GABAergic neurons ( Figure 6 E), we uncovered a surprising increase in synaptic release in GABAergic neurons of Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies in comparison with control flies ( Figure 6 F). Using in vivo Ca 2+ imaging in GABAergic neurons ( Pech et al., 2015 111. Pech, U. ∙ Revelo, N.H. ∙ Seitz, K.J. ... Optical dissection of experience-dependent pre- and postsynaptic plasticity in the Drosophila brain Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :2083-2095 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies showed no changes in presynaptic Ca 2+ responses ( Figure S5 C). Furthermore, the number of GABAergic neurons, as probed by glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) staining, revealed no difference in the brains of Cyfip 85.1 /+ and control flies ( Figure S5 D). GAD1 mRNA and protein levels also did not change ( Figures S5 E and S5F). These findings prompted us to measure glutamate levels, the metabolic precursor of GABA, by immunohistochemistry (data not shown) and HILIC-MS/MS ( Figure S6 A). No differences in glutamate levels were observed between Cyfip 85.1 /+ and control flies. Interestingly, the total concentration of GABA in Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants was not altered compared with controls, as seen by HILIC-MS/MS ( Figure 6 G). Combined, these results suggest that the entire pool of synthetized GABA (metabolic, intracellular, and extracellular) is not altered.
The increased activity of the Krebs/TCA cycle in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies lead us to hypothesize that GABA might be driven into the mitochondria, generating NADH and succinate to the Krebs/TCA cycle ( Bönnighausen et al., 2015; Carillo, 2018; Maguire et al., 2015; Michaeli et al., 2011 24.

A mitochondrial GABA permease connects the GABA shunt and the TCA cycle, and is essential for normal carbon metabolism Plant J. 2011; 67 :485-498 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore measured GABA levels by ELISA following fractionation to enrich mitochondria and synaptic vesicles ( Depner et al., 2014 48. Depner, H. ∙ Lützkendorf, J. ∙ Babkir, H.A. ... Differential centrifugation-based biochemical fractionation of the Drosophila adult CNS Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2796-2808 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, GABA concentration in the mitochondrial fraction of Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutants was markedly higher compared with controls, reduced in the synaptic vesicles, and, as also observed by HILIC-MS/MS, unchanged in the total fraction ( Figure 6 H). The purity and enrichment of the mitochondrial preparation was confirmed by western blot with the mitochondrial marker ATP5B and the synaptic marker BRP ( Figure S6 B). Taken together, these data are consistent with the idea that a reduction in CYFIP causes redistribution of GABA from a vesicular/synaptic to a mitochondrial compartment, supporting the elevated mitochondrial activity in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies and leading to subsequent alterations in social behavior.
Given that Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies show a redistribution of GABA from a synaptic to a mitochondrial compartment and that loss of CYFIP in GABAergic interneurons is sufficient to cause behavioral deficits, we next investigated whether sequestration of GABA is causally involved in CYFIP-related behavioral abnormalities. To do so, we augmented GABA levels in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies in three distinct ways: by feeding flies GABA, DL-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DABA; a GABA transaminase uptake inhibitor), or the anticonvulsant valproic acid (VPA; induces GABA release) ( Chateauvieux et al., 2010; Coghlan et al., 2012; Reynolds et al., 2007 35.

Chem. 2007; 14 :2799-2812 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Feeding Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies GABA for 5 days ( Figure 6 I) or DABA or VPA ( Figures S6 C and S6D) ameliorated the social behavior deficit. Interestingly, feeding flies GABA also rescued behavioral deficits in adult flies with pan-neuronal abrogation of Cyfip ( Figure S6 E). Similarly, pan-neuronal abrogation in adult flies of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD1) for 2 days led to a reduced number of social events ( Figure S6 F). Separate experiments in adult control flies showed that a high-GABA diet actually decreased social interaction ( Figure S6 G). Furthermore, feeding flies diazepam (valium), a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA A R receptor, was also able to restore the social deficits of Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies ( Figure S6 H). These data show that augmentation of GABAergic signaling in adults is sufficient to ameliorate the behavioral deficits in flies resulting from reduced C yfip dosage. Finally, underscoring the centrality of GABAergic signaling to this process, we demonstrate that administration of GABA, DABA, or VPA to GABAergic-specific CYFIP-depleted flies also restores social interactions ( Figure S6 I). The effect of GABA administration lasted 2 days after treatment ( Figure S6 J).
Our findings suggest that reduced available GABA causes social deficits in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies and that the reduction in vesicular GABA is due to GABA being transported into mitochondria, where it is catabolized into other intermediates through the GABA shunt and TCA cycle. We therefore set out to determine how GABA is being shunted into mitochondria.
Mitochondrial GABA transporters in eukaryotes have remained mostly uncharacterized ( Bönnighausen et al., 2015 24. Bönnighausen, J. ∙ Gebhard, D. ∙ Kröger, C. ... Disruption of the GABA shunt affects mitochondrial respiration and virulence in the cereal pathogen Fusarium graminearum Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 98 :1115-1132 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). From GO:0005741 term, mitochondrial outer membrane ( Table S3 ), we identified 35 candidate transporters in the fly and performed a genetic screen to test their effects in Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies. Flies with mutations in the 35 putative GABA transporters were individually crossed with Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies and tested in the food competition social interaction paradigm. Of the 35 putative GABA transporters tested, only the Aralar MI07552 mutant showed a significant effect, completely rescuing the behavioral deficits of Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Crossing the Cyfip 85.1 fly with the Aralar MI0755 mutant also ameliorated the Cyfip 85.1 /+ grooming and social space behavior deficits ( Figures 7 C and 7D) but not their hyperactivity ( Figure S7 A), further confirming that mitochondrial dysregulation and Aralar have a specific effect on social behavior. Aralar MI07552 /+ mutant flies exhibit decreased competition for food ( Figure 7 B), decreased grooming ( Figure 7 C), and hyperactivity ( Figure S7 A), similar to Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies.
Aralar has so far been described for its function as a carrier exchanging a glutamate and a proton (H + ) from the cytoplasm for an aspartate in mitochondria. This transport stoichiometry indicates that the proton gradient drives the transport ( Palmieri, 2013 106. Palmieri, F. The mitochondrial transporter family SLC25: identification, properties and physiopathology Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34 :465-484 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess whether GABA localization was affected by the mutation in Aralar, GABA levels were evaluated by ELISA upon fractionation of mitochondrial and cytosolic components. Although cytoplasmic GABA levels were increased in Aralar MI07552 /+ mutant brains, the levels and sequestration profile of GABA across the cytoplasm and mitochondria in Aralar MI07552 / Cyfip 85.1 double mutants were indistinguishable from controls ( Figure 7 E). The combined genetic and localization data strongly suggest that Aralar is a GABA transporter. In support of our model, inhibition of Aralar by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) ( Amoedo et al., 2016 5. Amoedo, N.D. ∙ Punzi, G. ∙ Obre, E. ... AGC1/2, the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carriers Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 :2394-2412 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ) ameliorated the competition for food of the Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies ( Figure S7 B).
To address how a reduced dose of Cyfip could change the activity of Aralar, we examined whether CYFIP controls Aralar expression. Neither the Aralar mRNA level ( Figure S7 C) nor its efficiency of translation or distribution of the mRNA on a polysome/messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) gradient changed ( Figure S7 D), suggesting that the regulation occurs at the level of Aralar activity.
As a final test of our hypothesis, we aimed to increase the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, which increases Aralar activity, and monitor social behavior in a control fly. Flies were treated with a sublethal dose of oligomycin to reduce complex V activity ( Spinazzi et al., 2019 137. Spinazzi, M. ∙ Radaelli, E. ∙ Horré, K. ... PARL deficiency in mouse causes Complex III defects, coenzyme Q depletion, and Leigh-like syndrome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :277-286 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), reducing the proton flux and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential ( Figure 7 F). Notably, under these conditions, the competition for food of control flies was decreased ( Figure 7 G) together with the level of available GABA in the cytosol ( Figure 7 H), resembling the Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutant condition. These data further support our previous observations that homeostasis of mitochondria GABA levels plays an important role in driving social behavior.

Section: Discussion

Using a Drosophila model of Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency, a hotspot genetic variant increasing the risk for SCZ and a candidate risk factor for ASD, we revealed that increased mitochondrial activity and membrane potential ( Figure 3 ) reduce GABA availability ( Figure 6 ) and play a causal role in mediating social behavioral abnormalities ( Figure 1 ).
It has been suggested that neurodevelopmental disorders may result from an imbalance between the excitatory glutamatergic and the inhibitory GABAergic pathways ( Ben-Ari, 2017; Benke and Möhler, 2018; Braat and Kooy, 2015; Cellot and Cherubini, 2014 18.

Changes in inhibitory activity that lead to altered excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in specific brain areas have been reported in patients with ASD, SCZ, and epilepsy ( Foss-Feig et al., 2017; Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019; Yizhar et al., 2011 54.

Mechanistic studies in mice using optogenetic manipulations in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have demonstrated that increasing the E/I ratio leads to social deficits, whereas restoration of E/I balance by increasing inhibition in specific GABAergic neurons (parvalbumin positive, PV+) rescues the observed social deficits ( Selimbeyoglu et al., 2017; Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019; Yizhar et al., 2011 128.

Neocortical excitation/inhibition balance in information processing and social dysfunction Nature. 2011; 477 :171-178 Crossref Scopus (1630) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, treatment with benzodiazepine, which enhances GABA A R receptor activity, ameliorates social behavioral deficits in mouse models of epilepsy and ASD ( Han et al., 2012, 2014; Sohal and Rubenstein, 2019 66.

Psychiatry. 2019; 24 :1248-1257 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with our data in flies ( Figure S6 ). Further, developmental Gabrb3 deletion in mouse somatosensory neurons leads to tactile sensitivity and reduced sociability through loss of GABA A R receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition, pointing out the importance of somatosensory dysfunction in ASDs ( Orefice et al., 2016 105. Orefice, L.L. ∙ Zimmerman, A.L. ∙ Chirila, A.M. ... Peripheral Mechanosensory Neuron Dysfunction Underlies Tactile and Behavioral Deficits in Mouse Models of ASDs Cell. 2016; 166 :299-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is notable that CYFIP1 is enriched at inhibitory synapses and that loss of CYFIP1 in rodents increases the E/I ratio ( Davenport et al., 2019 43. Davenport, E.C. ∙ Szulc, B.R. ∙ Drew, J. ... Autism and Schizophrenia-Associated CYFIP1 Regulates the Balance of Synaptic Excitation and Inhibition Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :2037-2051.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our work shows that augmenting GABAergic signaling in adult flies through genetic or pharmacological approaches, including treatment with the GABA A R receptor-positive allosteric modulator diazepam (valium), fully normalizes abnormal social behavior ( Figure S6 ). Combined, these findings suggest a common pathophysiological mechanism in these neurological disorders that starts with GABA impairment and leads to social deficits. However, despite past evidence of abnormal GABA signaling in ASD ( Ben-Ari et al., 2012; Cellot and Cherubini, 2014 19. Ben-Ari, Y. ∙ Khalilov, I. ∙ Kahle, K.T. ... The GABA excitatory/inhibitory shift in brain maturation and neurological disorders Neuroscientist. 2012; 18 :467-486 Crossref Scopus (430) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Cellot, G. ∙ Cherubini, E. GABAergic signaling as therapeutic target for autism spectrum disorders Front Pediatr. 2014; 2 :70 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and indications that cortical inhibitory neurons exhibit enrichment in ASD risk gene expression ( Wang et al., 2018 155. Wang, P. ∙ Zhao, D. ∙ Lachman, H.M. ... Enriched expression of genes associated with autism spectrum disorders in human inhibitory neurons Transl. Psychiatry. 2018; 8 :13 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), it has remained unclear how alterations in GABA and E/I balance occur in these disorders.
Here we demonstrate that an increase in mitochondrial metabolism causes GABA to be sequestered into mitochondria. Translocation of GABA reduces the amount of GABA available for vesicular uptake ( Figure 6 ), likely affecting neuronal activity. In fact, our observations are best explained by an effort of the GABAergic circuit to homeostatically correct low GABA release: the number of released vesicles is increased ( Figure 6 ), and the GABA A R receptor is overexpressed (data not shown; see also Davenport et al., 2019 43. Davenport, E.C. ∙ Szulc, B.R. ∙ Drew, J. ... Autism and Schizophrenia-Associated CYFIP1 Regulates the Balance of Synaptic Excitation and Inhibition Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :2037-2051.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reduced GABAergic transmission then affects behavior ( Figures 1 and 7 ).
To enter mitochondria, GABA needs to be transported across the mitochondrial membrane. To date, a mitochondrial GABA carrier has not been identified in any organism except in plants ( Michaeli et al., 2011 94. Michaeli, S. ∙ Fait, A. ∙ Lagor, K. ... A mitochondrial GABA permease connects the GABA shunt and the TCA cycle, and is essential for normal carbon metabolism Plant J. 2011; 67 :485-498 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we screened candidate transporters for rescue of the aberrant social behavior of C yfip mutant flies, leading to identification of the protein Aralar, which, as we went on to show, is responsible for GABA uptake into the mitochondria in Drosophila ( Figure 7 ). This work strengthens the link between mitochondrial function, GABA transmission, and social behavior.
Aralar belongs to the SLC25 family, the largest family of solute transporters that consists mainly of mitochondrial proteins ( Palmieri, 2013; Zorova et al., 2018 106. Palmieri, F. The mitochondrial transporter family SLC25: identification, properties and physiopathology Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34 :465-484 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar 171. Zorova, L.D. ∙ Popkov, V.A. ∙ Plotnikov, E.Y. ... Mitochondrial membrane potential Anal. Biochem. 2018; 552 :50-59 Crossref Scopus (893) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aralar homologs are present in all metazoans ( Amoedo et al., 2016 5. Amoedo, N.D. ∙ Punzi, G. ∙ Obre, E. ... AGC1/2, the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carriers Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 :2394-2412 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ), including two human homologs: SLC25A12 (AGC1) and SLC25A13 (AGC2). Aralar transporters have so far been shown to function by exchanging an aspartate in the mitochondrial matrix for a glutamate plus a proton on the cytosolic side, with the pH gradient across the inner membrane forming the bioenergetic driving force for solute exchange. As the major aspartate exporter from the mitochondrion, Aralar proteins play a major role in the malate-aspartate shuttle that carries redox equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane and, thus, align the redox potential of the mitochondria and the cytosol ( Amoedo et al., 2016; Palmieri, 2013 5. Amoedo, N.D. ∙ Punzi, G. ∙ Obre, E. ... AGC1/2, the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carriers Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 :2394-2412 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar 106. Palmieri, F. The mitochondrial transporter family SLC25: identification, properties and physiopathology Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34 :465-484 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study now indicates that Aralar can also transport GABA, in addition to glutamate, despite the lack of one carboxylic group that seems to be dispensable for binding to the transporter.
Neither the Aralar mRNA level nor its translational efficiency changes between the two genotypes ( Figure S7 ), indicating that its expression is not altered in C yfip mutant brains. Instead, the activity of the Aralar transporter changes. Because Aralar needs a proton for import of its substrate into mitochondria, the equilibrium distribution of the transport substrates is set by the pH gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, which, in turn, is a function of fuel availability, OXPHOS, and activity of the TCA cycle. Treatment with oligomycin (a highly specific inhibitor of complex V that increases the pH gradient) caused accumulation of GABA in mitochondria and affected social behavior ( Figure 7 ).
Because CYFIP regulates protein synthesis ( De Rubeis et al., 2013; Genheden et al., 2015; Napoli et al., 2008; Oguro-Ando et al., 2015; Panja et al., 2014; Santini et al., 2017 45.

Signal. 2017; 10 :504 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ) we hypothesize that it regulates the translation of a subsets of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial activity. Future studies are required to address which mRNAs are directly controlled by CYFIP. In support of our hypothesis, in C yfip mutants, two key enzymes of the TCA cycle, IDH and αKG, are upregulated at the protein ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ) and activity levels ( Figure 4 ). Furthermore, mitochondria in Cyfip mutant brains show a morphology ( Figure 3 ) that is typical of hyperactive mitochondria with a larger perimeter and area ( Yao et al., 2019 162. Yao, C.H. ∙ Wang, R. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Mitochondrial fusion supports increased oxidative phosphorylation during cell proliferation eLife. 2019; 8 Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar ). Interestingly, we show that alterations to the TCA cycle via overexpression of the IDH enzyme causes social aberrations comparable with those of C yfip mutant flies ( Figure 5 ). Further, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the IDH enzyme normalizes the increased mitochondrial activity observed in C yfip mutant flies and ameliorates their social deficits ( Figure 5 ). These data provide further support for a link between mitochondrial function, GABA transmission, and social behavior. Additionally, both human Aralar homologs have calcium-binding motifs in their cytosolic domain, and cytosolic calcium robustly increases transport activity ( Napolioni et al., 2011 100. Napolioni, V. ∙ Persico, A.M. ∙ Porcelli, V. ... The mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier AGC1 and calcium homeostasis: physiological links and abnormalities in autism Mol. Neurobiol. 2011; 44 :83-92 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ); the calcium-binding motifs are conserved in Drosophila Aralar. Therefore, the local calcium increases observed during pre-synaptic vesicle release may well be sufficient to trigger the GABA transport process, with local mitochondria responding to reduce local GABA availability. Thus, mitochondrial activity and high calcium, effects of increased neurotransmission, can effectively reduce GABAergic neurotransmission. This suggests that, under physiological conditions, Aralar-mediated GABA sequestration is likely to serve as a homeostatic feedback inhibition mechanism. In addition, every other physiological mechanism that increases the mitochondrial membrane potential will reduce GABAergic transmission.
Our data demonstrate a pivotal role of mitochondrial metabolism dysregulation and the associated sequestration of GABA into mitochondria in causing social behavioral deficits. Restoring mitochondrial membrane potential by a variety of pharmacological or genetic means rescues social behavioral deficits because of Cyfip haploinsufficiency ( Figure 5 ). Thus, our data might explain, in molecular terms, the positive effects of some antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, or risperidone, on patients with ASD and SCZ that lead to a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential ( Balijepalli et al., 1999 15.

The Aralar mutation that increases cytosolic GABA levels ( Figure 7 E) also affects social behavior, similar to the C yfip mutation ( Figures 7 B and 7C), whereas the double mutation normalizes cytosolic GABA levels and rescues social behavior. Moreover, GABA administration to control animals reduces social behavior ( Figure S6 ). Taken together, this suggests a precarious equilibrium where too little or too much GABA availability is detrimental. Thus, our findings predict that disturbances of mitochondrial function cause pathological alterations in social behavior and explain the well-established link between mitochondrial dysfunction and ASD (reviewed in Hollis et al., 2017 68. Hollis, F. ∙ Kanellopoulos, A.K. ∙ Bagni, C. Mitochondrial dysfunction in Autism Spectrum Disorder: clinical features and perspectives Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 45 :178-187 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although mitochondrial dysfunction may affect the nervous system in various ways, our model predicts that Aralar should be specifically linked to social disorders. Interestingly, two ASD-associated SNPs have been uncovered in AGC1/SLC25A12, the human Aralar isoform that is known to be expressed in neurons (see Aoki and Cortese, 2016 9. Aoki, Y. ∙ Cortese, S. Mitochondrial Aspartate/Glutamate Carrier SLC25A12 and Autism Spectrum Disorder: a Meta-Analysis Mol. Neurobiol. 2016; 53 :1579-1588 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar , for a meta-analysis; Pardo et al., 2013 108. Pardo, B. ∙ Contreras, L. ∙ Satrústegui, J.

(Lausanne). 2013; 4 :149 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and AGC1 expression is upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of ASD patients ( Anitha et al., 2012; Lepagnol-Bestel et al., 2008 8. Anitha, A. ∙ Nakamura, K. ∙ Thanseem, I. ... Brain region-specific altered expression and association of mitochondria-related genes in autism Mol.

SLC25A12 expression is associated with neurite outgrowth and is upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of autistic subjects Mol. Psychiatry. 2008; 13 :385-397 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, disruption of the gene in mice causes hypomyelination and abnormal neurofilament accumulation ( Sakurai et al., 2010 121. Sakurai, T. ∙ Ramoz, N. ∙ Barreto, M. ... Slc25a12 disruption alters myelination and neurofilaments: a model for a hypomyelination syndrome and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders Biol. Psychiatry. 2010; 67 :887-894 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ); more subtle changes in AGC1 activity are thus likely to alter brain development and cause ASD.
This study provides causal evidence linking mitochondrial energy production through the TCA cycle to alterations in GABA metabolism and further uncovers a mechanistic link between these molecular processes and alterations in behavior in social groups. Because alterations in mitochondrial metabolism are a hallmark of diverse neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, our findings could represent a common mechanism underlying social deficits in these disorders, and it has the potential to be relevant for physiological regulation of neurotransmission and also for a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our study demonstrates that social deficits in our fly model can be rescued by pharmacological dampening of mitochondrial respiration because this modulates Aralar activity. Therefore, molecules that specifically activate or inhibit human Aralar should be considered as potential therapeutic approaches for treatment of these disorders.

Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Prof. Claudia Bagni ( claudia.bagni@unil.ch ). There are restrictions to the availability of C yfip mutant flies due to a signed MTA with Dr. Angela Giangrande (co-author in this manuscript).
Flies were cultured in vials containing a standard Drosophila medium at 25°C with 60%–80% humidity in a 12h light/dark cycle. The fly line used as control was wild-type Canton-S w 1118 (iso1CJ). Heterozygous mutant flies for C yfip ( Cyfip 85.1 /+ ) lacking two-third of the C yfip -coding region were described previously by Schenck et al. (2003) 124. Schenck, A. ∙ Bardoni, B. ∙ Langmann, C. ... CYFIP/Sra-1 controls neuronal connectivity in Drosophila and links the Rac1 GTPase pathway to the fragile X protein Neuron. 2003; 38 :887-898 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar . The Cyfip 85.1 /+ mutant flies used in this study were isogenized for 6 generations with a Cantonized w 1118 background. Regulation of CYFIP expression was achieved using the tissue specific GAL4/UAS system ( Brand and Perrimon, 1993 28. Brand, A.H. ∙ Perrimon, N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes Development. 1993; 118 :401-415 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, to abrogate the levels of CYFIP we used the UAS- C yfip -RNAi (UAS- C yfip -IR) transgene as described before ( Galy et al., 2011 58. Galy, A. ∙ Schenck, A. ∙ Sahin, H.B. ... CYFIP dependent actin remodeling controls specific aspects of Drosophila eye morphogenesis Dev. Biol. 2011; 359 :37-46 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), GAL4 in turn will bind the Upstream Activation Sequence (UAS). As a result, the RNAi construct is transcribed and endogenous C yfip transcript will be downregulated. GAL4/GAL4 females were crossed en masse to UAS- C yfip -IR/UAS- C yfip -IR males to generate GAL4/UAS- C yfip -IR progeny. GAL4/GAL4 and UAS- C yfip -IR/UAS- C yfip -IR females were also crossed with w 1118 males to generate GAL4/+ and UAS- C yfip -IR/+ progeny respectively that served as controls. Tissue-specific GAL4 expression was achieved using the tissue-specific GAL4 promoters as follows: pan-neuronal (Elav), cholinergic (Cha-Gla4), and GABAergic (Gad-Gal4). To avoid neurodevelopmental problems and possible lethality, ElavGal4 was combined with the temporal TubGal80 ts system ( McGuire et al., 2003, 2004 91. McGuire, S.E. ∙ Le, P.T. ∙ Osborn, A.J. ... Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila Science. 2003; 302 :1765-1768 Crossref Scopus (967) PubMed Google Scholar 92. McGuire, S.E. ∙ Mao, Z. ∙ Davis, R.L. Spatiotemporal gene expression targeting with the TARGET and gene-switch systems in Drosophila Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004 :pl6 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). At 18°C, TubGal80 ts is active and binds GAL4, prohibiting its binding to the UAS (i.e., no transcription of UAS- C yfip -IR). In contrast, at 29-30°C TubGal80 ts is inactive and GAL4 will bind the UAS thus activating transcription of UAS- C yfip -IR. As a result, expression of CYFIP will be downregulated. All flies/progeny for promoter-Gal4;TubGal80 ts and their controls were cultured at 18°C and 2-days after eclosion were placed at 29-30°C allowing UAS- C yfip -IR transcription. For Ca 2+ imaging, flies were generated that express either synaptophysin-GCaMP ( Pech et al., 2015 111. Pech, U. ∙ Revelo, N.H. ∙ Seitz, K.J. ... Optical dissection of experience-dependent pre- and postsynaptic plasticity in the Drosophila brain Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :2083-2095 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) under control of the specific promoter GAL4 line ( Zars et al., 2000 167. Zars, T. ∙ Fischer, M. ∙ Schulz, R. ... Localization of a short-term memory in Drosophila Science. 2000; 288 :672-675 Crossref Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ).

All the other transgenic flies used in this study were purchased from the Bloomington stock center. Adult male flies (3-7 days old) were used in all the experiments unless differentially specified in the text.
All the behavioral experiments in flies were performed in a walk-in chamber by Fitoclima Aralab ( https://www.aralab.pt/ ), that offers highly precise and reproducible conditions for climatic and temperature testing.
Social performance of the Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies was investigated by observing courtship, a complex innate Drosophila behavior. Briefly, courting Drosophila males perform a characteristic sequence of behaviors: orienting toward and following the female, tapping her with their forelegs, vibrating one wing, licking her genitalia, and attempting to copulate ( Bastock, 1956; Bastock and Manning, 1955; Ejima and Griffith, 2007; Sokolowski, 2001, 2010 16.

Five to seven days-old virgin males and females were used. Each assay consisted of one Cyfip 85.1 /+ male and one wild-type female introduced into a plexiglass-mating chamber (1 cm diameter × 4 mm height). The courtship activities were video recorded until successful copulation, or longer (6 minutes) in the absence of copulation, using a 65X SD camcorder (Samsung) mounted on a tripod. The assays were done under ambient light at 22°C temperature and 70% humidity. From the video recordings the courtship index (CI) was calculated for each male. Briefly, CI is the fraction of total recording time the male performed courtship behaviors (orienting, chasing, tapping, licking, singing, copulation attempts) ( Ejima and Griffith, 2007; Siegel and Hall, 1979; Sokolowski, 2001, 2010 53.

Assays were performed on socially experienced, 3–7 days-old male flies. Groups of eight males from the same genotype were anesthetized 24 h prior to the assay and placed in vials with food. On the day of the assay, the males were transferred without anesthesia to an empty vial and were deprived of food for 90 minutes, after which they were exposed to a food droplet and given 2 minutes to acclimate to this disturbance. The flies were then observed for an additional 2-minutes, and the total number of social event encounters scored. Behavioral assays were conducted in a behavioral chamber (25°C, 60%–70% humidity) between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Statistics were calculated using a one-way fixed effect ANOVA model, Kruskal Wallis test in combination with Dunn’s multiple comparison test. A group of male flies were tested simultaneously to obtain an average of the total number of social events in 2 minutes (i.e., number of total approaches, lunges, tussles, wing threat and initiation of courtship scored) ( Dankert et al., 2009 41. Dankert, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Hoopfer, E.D. ... Automated monitoring and analysis of social behavior in Drosophila Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :297-303 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). The index of approaches in such a complex set up (8 flies) was used to quantify behavior.
Flies of 5 days old were collected the day before the assay and kept in vials with fresh food. The day of the experiment they were anesthetized by placing them on ice for 2 min and then placed into a grooming chamber (circular arena of 1cm diameter). Flies were allowed for 20 min to acclimate and then grooming activity was recorded for 3 min, using a 65X SD camcorder (Samsung) mounted on a tripod. To measure grooming behavior, raw videos were analyzed blind to the genotype, calculating the time of grooming over 3 min.
Flies were separated by gender the day prior to each experiment and kept in vials with fresh food. The analysis of social space behavior was performed using a horizontal circular chamber (a Petri dish of 9 cm diameter) as described before ( Simon et al., 2012 131. Simon, A.F. ∙ Chou, M.T. ∙ Salazar, E.D. ... A simple assay to study social behavior in Drosophila: measurement of social space within a group Genes Brain Behav. 2012; 11 :243-252 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flies were briefly anesthetized by placing them on ice for 2 min and placed into the chamber. Flies were allowed to acclimate for 10 min and then digital images were collected after the flies reached a stable position (up to 25 min). Digital images were imported in ImageJ and an automated measure of the nearest neighbor to each fly was determined using our own custom R script (available upon request).
Thigmotaxis behavior, refers to the tendency of flies to move closer to the wall of an open arena to avoid the central part (more threatening, centrophobicity) ( Besson and Martin, 2005 22. Besson, M. ∙ Martin, J.R. Centrophobism/thigmotaxis, a new role for the mushroom bodies in Drosophila J. Neurobiol. 2005; 62 :386-396 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). The distance of a fly from the wall of the chamber was measured using our own custom R script. Graphs and statistical analysis were performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
The negative geotaxis experiment allows to evaluate the reflex motor response in Drosophila as previously described ( Kosmidis et al., 2011 79. Kosmidis, S. ∙ Botella, J.A. ∙ Mandilaras, K. ... Ferritin overexpression in Drosophila glia leads to iron deposition in the optic lobes and late-onset behavioral defects Neurobiol. Dis. 2011; 43 :213-219 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 2-days-old control and Cyfip 85.1/+ flies were transferred individually into polystyrene tubes. The flies were allowed to acclimate for 10 min in a dark environment of 25°C and 70%–80% humidity illuminated by red light. Each fly was vortexed for 2 s and tested twice for negative geotaxis measuring the time the fly climbs the distance of 6 cm.
A colorimetric estimation of food intake was performed as previously described ( Aditi et al., 2016 1. Aditi, K. ∙ Shakarad, M.N. ∙ Agrawal, N. Altered lipid metabolism in Drosophila model of Huntington’s disease Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :31411 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. Briefly groups of 7-days old mated male flies, entrained under 12:12 LD (Light-dark cycle), were transferred onto food containing 2.5% (w/v) food dye (Erioglaucine blue disodium salt; Sigma-Aldrich), 2% agar and 5% sucrose, and left to feed ad libitum for 2 hours. After feeding the flies were washed with PBS 1X, each body was detached from the head and individually homogenized in 100 μL of chilled PBS 1X and centrifuged at 10.000 rpm for 10 min. 50 μL of supernatant was used for absorbance recording at 620nm using a spectrophotometer.
The Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) system from Trikinetics Inc. (Walthman, MA) was used to record the locomotor activity of flies. Male flies (1-week old), anesthetised on ice, were individually loaded into the locomotor activity-monitoring tubes, thin 5 mm diameter polycarbonate tubes containing 5% sucrose and 2% agar food and incubated for at least 4 days under 12:12 LD (light - dark) conditions at 25°C and 50%–60% humidity. Light was turned on at 7:30 am and turned off at 7:30 pm. The DAM system software counts the number of times the single fly walks through an infrared beam aimed at the middle of the tube. Data were recorded as the number of crossings (transitions) per bin of 5-30 minutes. The first day was excluded from the analysis to allow the flies to recover from anesthesia and to get acclimatized to the new environment. Two independent experiments were performed and at least 40 flies for each genotype were analyzed. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak’s post hoc test and by non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis’s test with Dunn’s correction.
For western blot analysis, male fly heads were homogenized in 2x Laemmli buffer containing DTT. They were loaded on 10% acrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used: anti-Syntaxin (DSHB) at 1:3000, anti-GAD1 (kind gift of Prof. Rob Jackson), anti-ATP5B (Abcam) at 1:4000, anti-NDUFS3 (Abcam) at 1:4000, anti-HSP60 (Santa Cruz) at 1:4000, anti-Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotech) at 1:1000, anti-VDAC/Porin (Abcam) at 1:2000, anti-Bruchpilot (DSHB) at 1:500, and anti-Tubulin (DSHB) at 1:4000. Detection was obtained using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR, Bioscience). The fluorescent secondary antibodies DyLight 800 anti-rabbit and DyLight 800 anti-mouse were used at 1:5000 (Thermo Scientific).
Total RNA was extracted from 30 male 1-week-old fly heads using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Before proceeding with the RT-PCR, RNA quantity and quality were determined with the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo, USA). Four independent samples for each genotype and 2 biological replicates have been collected.
Total RNA was diluted to prepare aliquots of 200 ng/10 μl and used in RT-PCR reaction for 1 h at 37°C, using random primers, M-MLV enzyme (Invitrogen), buffer 5x M-MLV reaction buffer, RNAase OUT and dNTPs, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA was diluted 1:20 and 5 μl cDNA was used for each qPCR 15 μl reaction. qPCR was conducted on a Light Cycler 96 (Roche, Switzerland) with SYBR Green PCR mix (Roche, Switzerland) with primers of our genes of interest: C yfip , gad, and ribosomal proteins L13 and L32 (encoding for the 60S ribosomal protein L13 and L32 respectively). All primer pairs were designed through the Fly Primer Bank ( https://www.flyrnai.org/flyprimerbank ) and were synthesized by IDT (Belgium) and Microsynth AG (Switzerland).
Two technical replicates for each biological replicate were assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (La Jolla, CA). Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak’s post hoc test and by Kruskal-Wallis’s test with Dunn’s correction or Mann-Whitney test.
Quantitative PCR for mtDNA content. Drosophila whole DNA (genomic and mitochondrial) from adult brains was obtained using a method previously described ( Yoon et al., 2017 165. Yoon, W.H. ∙ Sandoval, H. ∙ Nagarkar-Jaiswal, S. ...

The isolated DNA was used for qPCR as described above. Primers against the mitochondrial ribosomal protein 16S and the ribosomal protein L13 were used to amplify mtDNA and genomic DNA respectively.
The protocol was slightly modified from Napoli et al. (2008) 99. Napoli, I. ∙ Mercaldo, V. ∙ Boyl, P.P. ... The fragile X syndrome protein represses activity-dependent translation through CYFIP1, a new 4E-BP Cell. 2008; 134 :1042-1054 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar . Specifically, Drosophila heads were homogenized in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT, Protease inhibitor cocktail, 50 μg/mL CHX, RNase OUT and RNAsin inhibitor 2.5 μl/mL). The lysates were incubated 5 min on ice and then centrifuged 5 min at 1000 g. In the supernatant Triton-X 20% and NaDoc 10% were added to the supernatant. Samples were then centrifuged 8 min at 12000 g at 4°C and the supernatants centrifuged through 15%–50% (w/v) sucrose grandients for 2 hours at 37.000 rpm. Gradients were collected in 12 fractions. Equal volumes from each fraction were used for RNA extraction using Phenol-Chloroform-Isoamyl alchool (according to manufacturer’s conditions). 2 pg/μl of spike in Firefly Luciferase (FLuc) mRNA, (Promega) was added as loading control. The mRNA was used for RT and quantitative PCR as described in the manuscript. Aralar mRNA level (Aralar primer For: TCCTGGGACTCTTTTCCGAAT; Aralar primer Rev: GCCTGGAACTCCGAGAAGG) was normalized to Fluc mRNA level (FLuc Primer For: ATCTGCCTCCTGGCTTCAAC; FLuc Primer Rev: CGGTAGACCCAGAGCTGTTC).
All compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as described before ( Kanellopoulos et al., 2012; Zwarts et al., 2011 73. Kanellopoulos, A.K. ∙ Semelidou, O. ∙ Kotini, A.G. ...

The drugs were dissolved as per the manufacturer’s instructions and used at the following concentrations: ML309 at 5 μM, GABA at 50 μM, DABA 100 μM, Valproic acid (VPA) at 1 mM, Diazepam at 50 μM, Rotenone at 1-10 μM, Pyridoxal 5′ phosphate (PLP) at 50 μM, and Oligomycin at 500 μM. Compounds in solution were mixed with Formula 4-24® Instant Drosophila Medium (blue food) in water. Approximately 50–60 adult flies were placed in plastic vials containing 500 μL of each solution on top of an agar matrix and allowed to feed ad libitum before behavior. Vehicle treatment consisted of solvent added to blue food alone.
Fly brains were dissected under a stereomicroscope in phosphate-buffered saline 1x (PBS) for no longer than 1 hour and fixed in PBS 1x containing 3,7% formaldehyde for 10-15 minutes at room temperature using a rotator. After 3 washes of 10 minutes in PBT (PBS 1x, 0.3% Triton-X) the brains were blocked in 10% Normal Goat Serum in PBT for 30 minutes. The brains were then incubated with anti-GABA (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:500, anti-nc82 (DSHB) at 1:500, anti-GAD (DSHB) at 1:250, in 5% NGS in PBT at 4°C overnight. After the primary antibody incubation, the brains were washed in PBT 3 times for 10 minutes per wash and incubated with secondaries Alexa Fluro 546 or 488 (Life Technologies, USA) at 1:1000 in 5% NGS in PBT for 1-2 hours at room temperature (RT). Then the brains were washed again in PBT for 3 times at RT for 10 minutes and mounted in Mowiol containing DAPI (1:1000) on a glass slide. Pictures were taken on the Olympus FluoView FV1000 Confocal Microscope and analyzed with ImageJ software.
For the TMRE (Enzo) and Rhodamine 123 (Sigma-Aldrich) stainings, brains were dissected in HL3 solution (mM): 110 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 NaHCO 3 , 5 HEPES, 30 sucrose, 5 trehalose, and 10 MgCl 2 , pH 7.2. Dissected brains were stained with 10nM TMRE or Rhodamine123 dye for 5 minutes at room temperature. Brains were quickly washed with HL3 solution, mounted on glass slides and immediately imaged with confocal microscope Leica SP8 using the same settings for all the samples.
To isolate the GABAergic neuronal population from Drosophila brain , the enhancer-trap line Gad-GAL4 was used to drive the expression of GFP in GABAergic neurons of control and Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies. Brains from adult flies (n = 60) per genotype were dissected in cold 1xPBS. Tissues were dissociated using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) for 60 minutes at 37°C in the dark. The GFP-positive cells were fractionated from the GFP negative population using a BD FACSAria I by BD Biosciences (San Jose) with a 70 μm nozzle tip at 60psi. GFP was excited by a blue laser (488nm) and detected using a 530/30 bandpass (BP) filter. Dead cells were excluded using propidium iodide (PI) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and detected using a 610/20 BP filter. Post sort purity check was performed to ensure clean fractionation of both the GFP-positive and -negative populations. Data were analyzed and presented with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Control and Cyfip 85.1 /+ flies were generated to express the synaptically targeted Ca 2+ sensitive fluorescent protein G-CaMP3 or the vesicle-release reporter synaptopHluorin in the GABAergic neurons. Brains of male transgenic flies (seven days old) expressing synaptophysin-GCaMP ( Pech et al., 2015 111. Pech, U. ∙ Revelo, N.H. ∙ Seitz, K.J. ... Optical dissection of experience-dependent pre- and postsynaptic plasticity in the Drosophila brain Cell Rep. 2015; 10 :2083-2095 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) or synaptopHluorin ( Ng et al., 2002 103. Ng, M. ∙ Roorda, R.D. ∙ Lima, S.Q. ... Transmission of olfactory information between three populations of neurons in the antennal lobe of the fly Neuron. 2002; 36 :463-474 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ) were imaged at a frame rate of 5 Hz and for 100 ms per frame at 488 nm through a window cut into the head capsule using an upright fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Examiner D1) equipped with a xenon lamp (Lambda DG-4, Sutter Instrument), a 14-bit CCD camera (Coolsnap HQ, Photometrics) and a 20 × water-immersion objective (NA = 1.0). 50 μl of freshly prepared 1M KCl were injected into the Ringer’s solution covering the brain (final concentration at the brain ∼0.05M). Image acquisition was controlled using the software Metafluor (Visitron Systems, Puchheim). Image processing and analysis was performed with Fiji software. Circular regions of interest (ROIs, diameter ∼20 μm) were placed in the center of the calyx or on the lobes. Background fluorescence outside the neuropils was subtracted from each ROI, “F 0 ” was determined by the average pixel intensity of five frames directly before stimulus onset, ΔF is the difference between the fluorescence in each frame and F 0 , and resulting values were normalized by dividing by F 0 . The experimental flies were heterozygous for the sensor in either the w 1118 background only or carrying the C yfip 85.1 /+ mutation. Both controls and mutant flies were measured alternately on the same days.
Sample was dissolved in Laemmli buffer and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, which was stopped when the front reached about 1/5 of the gel. The gel was fixed overnight and stained briefly with colloidal Coomassie blue. The protein-containing gel piece was chopped into 1 mm by 1 mm pieces, destained, and subjected to trypsin digestion as described previously ( Chen et al., 2015 38. Chen, N. ∙ Koopmans, F. ∙ Gordon, A. ... Interaction proteomics of canonical Caspr2 (CNTNAP2) reveals the presence of two Caspr2 isoforms with overlapping interactomes Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1854 :827-833 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tryptic peptides were dissolved in 17 μL 0.1M acetic acid, and analyzed by nano-LC MS/MS using an Ultimate 3000 LC system (Dionex, Thermo Scientific) coupled to a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (Sciex). Peptides were fractionated on a 200 mm Alltima C18 column (100 μm i.d., 3 μm particle size). The acetonitrile concentration in the mobile phase was increased from 5 to 30% in 90 minutes, to 40% in 5 minutes, and to 90% in another 5 minutes, at a flow rate of 400 nL/minutes. The eluted peptides were electro-sprayed into the TripleTOF MS. The nano-spray needle voltage was set to 2500V. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode with a single MS full scan (m/z 350−1200, 250 msec) followed by a top 25 MS/MS (85 msec per MS/MS, precursor ion > 90 counts/s, charge state from +2 to +5) with an exclusion time of 16 s once the peptide was fragmented. Ions were fragmented in the collision cell using rolling collision energy, and a spread energy of 10eV. The MS raw data were imported into MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8), and searched against the uniprot-proteome_fruitfly_%3AUP000000803 database, with match between run enabled. Further MaxQuant settings were left at default.
Orthology mapping was obtained using the DRSC DIOPT tool ( Hu et al., 2011 72. Hu, Y. ∙ Flockhart, I. ∙ Vinayagam, A. ... An integrative approach to ortholog prediction for disease-focused and other functional studies BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :357 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ) that makes use of the following resources: Ensembl Compara ( Vilella et al., 2009 152.

Ensembl variation resources BMC Genomics. 2010; 11 :293 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ) databases using the topOnto package ( https://github.com/statbio/topOnto ). The annotation data was standardized using MetaMap ( Aronson and Lang, 2010 10. Aronson, A.R. ∙ Lang, F.M. An overview of MetaMap: historical perspective and recent advances J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 2010; 17 :229-236 Crossref Scopus (1055) PubMed Google Scholar ) and NCBO Annotator to recognize terms found in the Human Disease Ontology (HDO) ( Schriml et al., 2012 125.

Recognized disease ontology terms were then associated with gene identifiers and stored locally. Disease term enrichment for the 279 human genes was then calculated using the Topology-based Elimination Fisher method ( Alexa et al., 2006 3. Alexa, A. ∙ Rahnenführer, J. ∙ Lengauer, T. Improved scoring of functional groups from gene expression data by decorrelating GO graph structure Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :1600-1607 Crossref Scopus (1358) PubMed Google Scholar ) found in the topGO package ( https://topgo.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ ), together with the standardized OMIM/GeneRIF/Ensembl variation gene-disease annotation data (17731 gene-disease associations), and the full HDO tree (3140 terms). We tested the dataset for functional enrichment using the GO Cellular Component (CC) and Biological Function (BP) ontologies ( Ashburner et al., 2000 11. Ashburner, M. ∙ Ball, C.A. ∙ Blake, J.A. ..., The Gene Ontology Consortium Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :25-29 Crossref Scopus (27946) PubMed Google Scholar ), together with the topGO package and Elimination Fisher method. We found 1078 (1692) CC terms for Fly (Human) and 6479 (14291) BP terms (See Tables S1 , S2 , and S3 ). Enrichment results are shown in Figure 2 , where P values have been corrected using the Bonferroni correction at the 0.01 ( ∗∗∗ ) and 0.05 ( ∗∗ ) significance level, using the number of terms in the GO tree.
The fly PPI network was built using the total 361 genes found, together with interactions extracted from the publicly available databases: FlyBase, BioGRID, IntAct, BIND, DIP, MINT.The fly PPI network was filtered to contain only interactions between the 361 genes. The final largest connected component contains 274 genes and 1014 interactions. The network was found to have overall associative mixing (0.097), driven by main contributors BioGRID (0.187) and FlyBase (0.85). The corresponding human PPI network built from the 278 human orthologs, was found to consist of 234 genes and 1143 interactions.
The fly PPI network consisting of 274 genes and 1014 interactions, using the Vision visualization package ( https://visone.info/ ) and clustered using the Modularity based Potts model and simulated annealing algorithm “spinglass” ( Reichardt and Bornholdt, 2006; Traag and Bruggeman, 2009 115.

Genes are highlighted using GO annotation with “mitochondrion” (GO:0005739) related genes in peach, “cytoskeleton” related genes in navy blue, and “synaptic vesicle” related genes in orange. For each cluster in the fly PPI network found, we further tested the significance of enrichment for function and disease, using the Hypergeometric distribution for sampling without replacement: 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 = 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 ; 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 , 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑛 , 𝐹 , 𝑁 ) = ( 𝐹 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 ) ⁢ ( 𝑁 − 𝐹 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑛 − 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 ) ( 𝑁 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑛 ) , 𝑃 − 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ ( 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 ) = ∑ 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 𝑖 = 0 { 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 = 𝑖 ) : 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 = 𝑖 ) ≤ 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 = 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 ) 0 : 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 = 𝑖 ) > 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑋 = 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 ) . (eqn-1) Where in eqn-1, N is the total number of genes in the network; Cn the number of genes in the community; F the total number of functional annotated genes in the network, and 𝜇 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑐 the number of functional annotated genes per community. P values were tested for their strength of significance, by recording the percentage of P values found from every community/annotation combination, lower than or equal to the observed P value, when 1000 random permutations of the annotation labels were made. A pseudocount of 1 was added to avoid permutated P values of zero. P values found with a strength of significance < 1% were considered statistically significant. Functionally enriched clusters, for GO “mitochondrion,” “cytoskeleton” and “synaptic vesicle” related annotations are also highlighted. Gene ontology analysis for genetic screening. 178 Drosophila genes were associated with GO “mitochondrial outer membrane” (GO:0005741). Out of 178, 43 genes were selected that were described to be involved in transport (excluding protons, electrons transport and OXPHOS). From the 43 genes, 36 available mutant fly strains were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (NIH P40OD018537) and used in this study.
Both groups of metabolites, amino acids and TCA cycle intermediates, were quantified using stable-isotope-dilution Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) as described below. Snap frozen brain samples were pre-extracted and homogenized by the addition of 100 μL of MeOH:H2O (4:1) per 10 fly brains (2 × 20 s at 10000 rpm, Cryolys Precellys Homogenizer, Bertin Technologies, Rockville, MD, US). Homogenized extracts were centrifuged (15 minutes at 4000 g at 4°C) and the resulting supernatant was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator (LabConco, Missouri, US). Total protein content was measured in pellets using the BCA assay. Dried sample extracts were resuspended in 50μL of MeOH:H2O (4:1, v/v) and mixed with 250μL of the ice-cold internal standard solution (in 100% acetonitrile). Samples were then incubated 30 minutes at −80°C in order to promote protein precipitation and centrifuged 15 minutes at 4°C and 2700 g. The resulting supernatants were injected for LC-MS analysis. Quantification of amino acids was performed using Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HILIC - HRMS) in positive ionization mode using a QExactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap interfaced with Thermo Accela 1250 UPLC pump and CTC PAL Analytics autosampler. Metabolites were separated using a BEH Amide, 1.7 μm, 100 mm × 2.1 mm I.D. column (Waters, Massachusetts, US). The mobile phase was composed of A = 20 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% FA in water and B = 0.1% FA in ACN. The linear gradient elution from 95% B (0-2 minutes) to 65% B (14 minutes) and down to 50% B (16 – 18 minutes) was applied, followed by 4 minutes of column re-equilibration in the initial gradient conditions. The flow rate was 400μL/minutes and the sample injection volume was 10 μL. HESI source conditions were set as follow: sheath gas flow at 60, Aux gas flow rate at 20, Sweep gas flow rate at 0, spray voltage at +3kV, capillary temperature at 300°C, s-lens RF level at 60 and aux gas heater temperature at 300°C. The instrument was set to acquire over the mass range 60−900, with the MS acquisition parameters set as follows: resolution at 70’000 FWHM, 1 microscan, 1e6 AGC and maximum inject time at 100 ms. Amino acids and derivatives were quantified by using a standard calibration curves and isotopic labeled internal standards. LC-MS data was processed using TraceFinder Clinical Research (version 4.1, Thermo Fischer Scientific). Quantification of TCA cycle intermediates was performed using Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC - MS/MS) in negative ionization mode using a 6495 Triple Quadrupole system (QqQ) interfaced with 1290 UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies). TCA metabolites were separated using a ZIC-pHILIC (100 mm, 2.1 mm I.D. and 5 μm particle size) column. The mobile phase was composed of A = 20 mM ammonium Acetate and 20 mM NH4OH in water at pH 9.35 and B = 100% ACN. The linear gradient elution from 90% B (0-1.5 minutes) to 50% B (8 – 11 minutes) and down to 45% B (12 – 15 minutes) was applied, followed by 9 minutes of column re-equilibration using the initial gradient conditions. The flow rate was 300 μL/minutes, column temperature 30°C and sample injection volume 2μl. ESI source conditions were set as follows: dry gas temperature 290°C and flow 14 L/minutes, sheath gas temperature 350°C, nebulizer 45 psi, and flow 12 L/minutes, nozzle voltage 0 V, and capillary voltage −2000 V. Data were acquired in a Dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (DMRM) mode with a total cycle time of 600 msec. Collision energies were optimized for each metabolite. LC-MS/MS data was processed using the Agilent Quantitative analysis software (version B.07.00, MassHunter Agilent technologies). Relative quantification of metabolites was based on EIC (Extracted Ion Chromatogram) areas for the monitored MRM transitions. For absolute quantification, calibration curves and the stable isotope-labeled internal standards (IS) were used and the concentrations of the compounds were calculated as the ratio of MS response (peak area) between the analyte and the IS, to account for matrix effects. Finally, the concentrations were reported to total protein content in brain tissue. For isotope tracing, flies were fed with sucrose free food containing [U-13C]-glucose for 6 hours and immediately dissected in cold PBS 1x. For each sample ten Drosophila brains were pre-extracted and homogenized as described above. Brain extracts were analyzed by Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HILIC - HRMS) in negative ionization mode using a 6550 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) system interfaced with 1290 UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies) as previously described ( Gallart-Ayala et al., 2018 57.

Raw LC-MS files were processed in Profinder B.08.00 software (Agilent Technologies) using the targeted data mining in isotopologue extraction mode. The metabolite identification was based on accurate mass and retention time matching against an in-house database containing data on 600 polar metabolite standards (analyzed in the same analytical conditions). The Extracted Ion Chromatogram areas (EICs) of each isotopologue (M+0, M+1, M+2, M+3,…) were corrected for natural isotope abundance ( Midani et al., 2017 95. Midani, F.S. ∙ Wynn, M.L. ∙ Schnell, S.

For measuring mitochondrial respiration in Drosophila brains: ten fly heads from 4 days old male were rapidly dissected under a microscope and mechanically homogenized in Miro6 Buffer (20 mM HEPES, 110 mM sucrose, 10 mM KH 2 PO4, 20 mM taurine, 60 mM lactobionic acid, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 EGTA, pH 7.1, 1 mg/ml fatty acid free BSA, catalase 280 U/ml) ( Krumschnabel et al., 2015 80. Krumschnabel, G. ∙ Fontana-Ayoub, M. ∙ Sumbalova, Z. ... Simultaneous high-resolution measurement of mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide production Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1264 :245-261 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ), then immediately loaded into an Oroboros 2K oxygraph chamber filled with Miro6 buffer equilibrated at 25°C. Drosophila bodies. For mitochondrial respiration in fly bodies, fly heads were rapidly removed and bodies were mechanically permeabilized in Miro6 Buffer. The body homogenates were then spun at 200 g for 5 minutes and the supernatant was immediately loaded into the Oroboros 2K oxygraph. In each of these protocols, the intactness of the mitochondrial outer membrane was checked by addition of exogenous cytochrome c . Oxygen consumption rates were measured before and after addition of the following sequence of substrates and specific inhibitors: 1) 2.5 mM pyruvate, 1 mM malate in flies (CI leak), followed by 2.5 mM ADP to determine complex I-driven phosphorylating respiration (CI OXPHOS). 2) 5 mM succinate to determine the phosphorylating respiration driven by simultaneous activation of complex I and II (CI+II OXPHOS). 3) Titrating concentrations of the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP to reach the maximal, uncoupled respiration (CI+II electron transfer system, ETS). 4) 200 nM rotenone to fully inhibit complex I-driven respiration and measure complex II-driven uncoupled respiration (CII electron transfer system, CII ETS). 5) 0.5 μM Antimycin A to block mitochondrial respiration at the level of complex III. Residual oxygen consumption was always negligible. 6) 2 mM ascorbate, 0.5 mM TMPD to measure cytochrome c oxidase (CIV or COX)- driven respiration. 7) 300 μM potassium cyanide to specifically block cytochrome c oxidase activity and measure residual background oxygen consumption caused by chemical interaction between ascorbate and TMPD. Cytochrome c oxidase-driven respiration is the cyanide sensitive oxygen consumption. NADH and NADt levels were measured from brain lysates using the NAD/NADH Quantitation Colorimetric Kit (Biovision, K337). The enzyme activity of IDH was determined from isolated mitochondria using the BioVision kit (K756-100). Mitochondria were isolated as previously described ( Depner et al., 2014; Yoon et al., 2017 48. Depner, H. ∙ Lützkendorf, J. ∙ Babkir, H.A. ...

Citrate synthase (CS) activity was measured using the MAK193 assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, isolated mitochondria from 100 fly brains were used for measuring the CS activity. CS activity was calculated using a coupled enzyme reaction, which leads to a colorimetric (412 nm) product proportional to the enzymatic activity present. One unit of CS is the enzyme that generates 1.0 mmole CoA per min at 25°C and pH 7.2. The absorbance was measured in a microplate photometer at 412 nm.
Electron microscopy. Brains from 3-5 days old male flies were dissected in cold PBS 1x and fixed overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.4. After rinsing in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, the samples were post fixed in 1:1 2% OsO 4 and 0.2 M cacodylate buffer for 1 hour. After 3 water washes, samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in an epoxy resin (Sigma-Aldrich). Ultrathin sections (60-70 nm) were obtained with an Ultrotome V (LKB) ultramicrotome, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed with a Tecnai G 2 (FEI) transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Images were captured with a Veleta (Olympus Soft Imaging System) digital camera. Quantification of mitochondria perimeter and area was performed by using ImageJ software.
ELISA. GABA levels were determined from fly brains using the GABA ELISA Enzyme immunoassay (IBL, ID59301). Briefly, total brain lysates, isolated mitochondria and vesicles ( Depner et al., 2014; Yoon et al., 2017 48. Depner, H. ∙ Lützkendorf, J. ∙ Babkir, H.A. ... Differential centrifugation-based biochemical fractionation of the Drosophila adult CNS Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2796-2808 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar 165.

The samples were incubated with a polyclonal antibody against GABA-derivative, together with assay reagent containing GABA-derivative (tracer). The concentration of antibody-bound tracer is inversely proportional to the GABA concentration in the sample. Peroxidase conjugate was added to detect the tracer and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) served as a peroxidase substrate. The absorbance was measured in a microplate photometer at 450nm.
