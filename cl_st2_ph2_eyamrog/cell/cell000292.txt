Title: Lymph nodes are innervated by a unique population of sensory neurons with immunomodulatory potential


Abstract: Summary

Barrier tissue immune responses are regulated in part by nociceptors. Nociceptor ablation alters local immune responses at peripheral sites and within draining lymph nodes (LNs). The mechanisms and significance of nociceptor-dependent modulation of LN function are unknown. Using high-resolution imaging, viral tracing, single-cell transcriptomics, and optogenetics, we identified and functionally tested a sensory neuro-immune circuit that is responsive to lymph-borne inflammatory signals. Transcriptomics profiling revealed that multiple sensory neuron subsets, predominantly peptidergic nociceptors, innervate LNs, distinct from those innervating surrounding skin. To uncover LN-resident cells that may interact with LN-innervating sensory neurons, we generated a LN single-cell transcriptomics atlas and nominated nociceptor target populations and interaction modalities. Optogenetic stimulation of LN-innervating sensory fibers triggered rapid transcriptional changes in the predicted interacting cell types, particularly endothelium, stromal cells, and innate leukocytes. Thus, a unique population of sensory neurons monitors peripheral LNs and may locally regulate gene expression.

Section: Introduction

The nervous and immune systems have been viewed traditionally as functionally and anatomically distinct even though they share a critical common task: to detect and respond to internal and external threats that may be physical, chemical, or biological in nature. The nervous system has a direct role in avoidance of potentially injurious or infectious situations, whereas the immune system provides key resistance and repair mechanisms. Neuro-immune interactions have been investigated in a number of settings, especially in the central nervous system (CNS) ( Klein et al., 2017 66. Klein, R.S. ∙ Garber, C. ∙ Howard, N.

However, the mechanisms and consequences of these multi-faceted interactions are still poorly understood.
Best recognized for their sensory role, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons provide the CNS with information from the periphery through direct innervation of peripheral tissues. Traditional structural and functional characterization of sensory neurons and, more recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-based molecular profiling have revealed a high degree of heterogeneity among somatosensory neurons ( Sharma et al., 2020 115.

In particular, one major subset of sensory neurons, nociceptors, has been increasingly appreciated for its diversity and potential for sensing and modulating immune and inflammatory processes ( Sharma et al., 2020 115.

In many cases, nociceptor modulation of immunity involves bioactive neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P, which are released from activated peripheral terminals of nociceptors and act on various immune and stromal cells that express the corresponding receptors ( Assas et al., 2014 7.

Peptidergic neurons of putative sensory origin innervate most, if not all, secondary lymphoid organs and barrier tissues, but their density, pattern of innervation, and neighboring cell types are notably different between tissues ( Belvisi, 2002 12.

This raises the intriguing possibility that sensory neurons targeting distinct peripheral sites may contribute differently to immune responses by engaging in local tissue-specific sensory neuro-immune circuits. Indeed, recent work has uncovered a key role of nociceptors in shaping immune activity in major barrier tissues, as evidenced by animal models of asthma, colitis, psoriasis, and infectious disease ( Baral et al., 2019 9.

To date, the immunomodulatory effect of nociceptors has been documented primarily in the context of innate immune responses, where pro- and anti-inflammatory activities are observed. For instance, nociceptors in the skin can sense invading bacteria and attenuate inflammatory responses against bacterial infections ( Chiu et al., 2013 22. Chiu, I.M. ∙ Heesters, B.A. ∙ Ghasemlou, N. ... Bacteria activate sensory neurons that modulate pain and inflammation Nature. 2013; 501 :52-57 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, upon topical exposure to imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, dermal dendritic cells (DCs) require signals from cutaneous nociceptors to produce interleukin (IL)-23, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives psoriasiform dermatitis ( Riol-Blanco et al., 2014 112. Riol-Blanco, L. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Perro, M. ... Nociceptive sensory neurons drive interleukin-23-mediated psoriasiform skin inflammation Nature. 2014; 510 :157-161 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, both studies report that nociceptors also affect regional lymph nodes (LNs); systemic nociceptor ablation prior to a bacterial infection caused a profound increase in lymphoid and myeloid LN cellularity ( Chiu et al., 2013 22. Chiu, I.M. ∙ Heesters, B.A. ∙ Ghasemlou, N. ... Bacteria activate sensory neurons that modulate pain and inflammation Nature. 2013; 501 :52-57 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas, upon imiquimod exposure, the absence of nociceptors reduced LN cellularity ( Riol-Blanco et al., 2014 112. Riol-Blanco, L. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Perro, M. ... Nociceptive sensory neurons drive interleukin-23-mediated psoriasiform skin inflammation Nature. 2014; 510 :157-161 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). In both settings, nociceptors were globally ablated, so it is unclear whether the observed effects were due to loss of sensory innervation in the LNs themselves or in the surrounding non-lymphoid tissues.
LNs act as sentinel organs that collect, filter, and monitor the constant flow of interstitial fluid (lymph) that is drained from peripheral tissues by afferent lymph vessels. LNs are the principal initiation sites for adaptive immune responses and are required for maintenance of peripheral tolerance to self-antigens ( Buettner and Bode, 2012 17. Buettner, M. ∙ Bode, U.

Secondary lymphoid organs are important but not absolutely required for allograft responses Am. J. Transplant. 2003; 3 :259-266 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Generation of local adaptive immune responses against immunogens critically depends on bidirectional information flow between the peripheral site of initial immune challenge and the draining LNs, where antigen acquisition/presentation and subsequent lymphocyte differentiation and maturation are orchestrated. This process relies on directed transport of antigen-presenting cells, cytokines, and antigens via afferent lymph vessels from the periphery and selective recruitment of vast numbers of naive and memory lymphocytes from the blood via high endothelial venules (HEVs). Within LNs, specialized endothelial and stromal cells delineate the lymph conduits and organize the extravascular space into discrete anatomic domains. In addition, a variety of myeloid leukocytes cooperate to support efficient antigen encounters by B and T cells to elicit an appropriate immunogenic or tolerogenic response.
Previous studies of LNs in several mammalian species have shown that LNs are innervated by noradrenergic and peptidergic neurons ( Felten et al., 1985 39. Felten, D.L. ∙ Felten, S.Y. ∙ Carlson, S.L. ... Noradrenergic and peptidergic innervation of lymphoid tissue J. Immunol. 1985; 135 :755s-765s PubMed Google Scholar ; Fink and Weihe, 1988 41. Fink, T. ∙ Weihe, E. Multiple neuropeptides in nerves supplying mammalian lymph nodes: messenger candidates for sensory and autonomic neuroimmunomodulation? Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 90 :39-44 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In animal models of arthritis and contact hypersensitivity, local application of capsaicin, a neurotoxin that targets TRPV1 (transient receptor potential channel-vanilloid subfamily member 1), attenuates inflammatory responses, suggesting a pro-inflammatory role for capsaicin-sensitive sensory innervation of LNs ( Felten et al., 1992 40. Felten, D.L. ∙ Felten, S.Y. ∙ Bellinger, D.L. ... Noradrenergic and peptidergic innervation of secondary lymphoid organs: role in experimental rheumatoid arthritis Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 22 :37-41 PubMed Google Scholar ; Lorton et al., 2000 76. Lorton, D. ∙ Lubahn, C. ∙ Engan, C. ... Local application of capsaicin into the draining lymph nodes attenuates expression of adjuvant-induced arthritis Neuroimmunomodulation. 2000; 7 :115-125 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Shepherd et al., 2005a 117. Shepherd, A.J. ∙ Beresford, L.J. ∙ Bell, E.B. ... Mobilisation of specific T cells from lymph nodes in contact sensitivity requires substance P J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 164 :115-123 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recently, a diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA)-based mouse model in which mice are globally deficient in nociceptors revealed a role of sensory neurons in regulating antigen retention and flow through peripheral LNs in immunized mice ( Hanes et al., 2016 49. Hanes, W.M. ∙ Olofsson, P.S. ∙ Talbot, S. ... Neuronal circuits modulate antigen flow through lymph nodes Bioelectron. Med. 2016; 3 :18-28 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation, together with studies in sheep that showed a stimulatory effect of a neuropeptide, substance P, on lymph flow and lymphocyte recirculation through peripheral LNs ( Moore et al., 1989 90. Moore, T.C. ∙ Lami, J.L. ∙ Spruck, C.H. Substance P increases lymphocyte traffic and lymph flow through peripheral lymph nodes of sheep Immunology. 1989; 67 :109-114 PubMed Google Scholar ), suggests that modulation of lymphatic trafficking may be one of the mechanisms by which putative sensory innervation could locally regulate immune responses in LNs. Nonetheless, sensory neuron-immune interactions in LNs have yet to be established definitively and studied systematically.
Here, by integrating state-of-the-art imaging, retrograde labeling, scRNA-seq, and optogenetics, we mapped sensory neuronal, immune and stromal components of skin-draining LNs. We found that sensory neurons innervate LNs with a preferential distribution toward the LN periphery, the region most prone to undergo rapid inflammation-induced mechanical, chemical, and cellular changes. Using scRNA-seq of retrogradely labeled DRG neurons, we identified four molecularly distinct LN-innervating sensory neuronal subtypes with strong enrichment for peptidergic nociceptors. Moreover, we found that LN-innervating neurons expressed a specific set of inflammatory molecules and receptors and could undergo structural remodeling following cutaneous challenge with direct (TLR4) and indirect (TLR1/2) agonists. This suggests that peripheral inflammatory signals are conveyed to LN-innervating neurons via additional secondary mediators, potentially through communication with other LN-resident cell types. To nominate the putative cellular communication partners of these sensory neurons, we used Seq-Well-based scRNA-seq to generate a single-cell “atlas” of murine steady-state LNs. By in-silico -matching known ligands and receptors expressed by LN-innervating sensory neurons and each LN-resident stromal and immune subset, we determined that stromal cells exhibit the highest potential for interaction with local sensory fibers. Finally, using optogenetic triggering, we first stimulated LN-innervating sensory neurons and then profiled LN-resident cell types using single-cell transcriptomics to identify the LN-resident cells most responsive to neuronal activity, including lymphatic endothelial cells, non-HEV blood endothelial cells, non-endothelial stroma, and certain populations of innate leukocytes, confirming our predictions. Our results define the anatomical and molecular identity of a previously enigmatic population of sensory neurons that innervate LNs and uncover a sensory neuron-stroma axis in steady-state LNs. The experimental and computational frameworks and foundational datasets established in this study should be broadly applicable to future analysis of neural circuits in a wide variety of tissues.

Section: Results

To establish whether, where, and to what extent LNs are innervated by sensory neurons, we pursued several complementary strategies. First, we labeled peripheral neurons of sensory lineage, including nociceptors, with tdTomato using “knockin” mice that expressed Cre recombinase under control of the Nav1.8 locus, which encodes a nociceptor-enriched voltage-gated sodium channel ( Nassar et al., 2004 93. Nassar, M.A. ∙ Stirling, L.C. ∙ Forlani, G. ... Nociceptor-specific gene deletion reveals a major role for Nav1.7 (PN1) in acute and inflammatory pain Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :12706-12711 Crossref Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). To visualize the complete 3D morphology of nerve fibers within intact popliteal LNs (popLNs) from these animals, we used a protocol adapted from a previously described tissue imaging method, immunolabeling-enabled 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO; STAR Methods ; Renier et al., 2014 110. Renier, N. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Simon, D.J. ... iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging Cell. 2014; 159 :896-910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). By co-staining for tdTomato and the pan-neuronal marker β3-tubulin, tdTomato + nerve fibers, presumably originating from sensory neurons, were readily detectable as a major component of the neuronal architecture within and in the immediate vicinity of popLNs, particularly at the hilus ( Figure 1 A; Video S1 ). Consistent with previous studies that describe sympathetic innervation of LNs ( Bellinger et al., 1992 11. Bellinger, D.L. ∙ Lorton, D. ∙ Felten, S.Y. ... Innervation of lymphoid organs and implications in development, aging, and autoimmunity Int. J.

Noradrenergic and peptidergic innervation of lymphoid tissue J. Immunol. 1985; 135 :755s-765s PubMed Google Scholar ), popLNs also contained a sizeable population of tdTomato – neuronal fibers that expressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a prototypical marker for sympathetic neurons ( Figure 1 B; Video S1 ). In comparison, cholinergic parasympathetic fibers genetically labeled with GFP in ChAT BAC -EGFP animals, where EGFP expression was driven by endogenous choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) transcriptional regulatory elements within a transgene, were never observed in LNs, even though scattered GFP + cells were detectable in LNs, likely representing previously described ChAT + immune cells ( Reardon et al., 2013 109.

Genomics. 2006; 27 :391-397 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 A). As noted previously ( Bellinger et al., 1992 11. Bellinger, D.L. ∙ Lorton, D. ∙ Felten, S.Y. ... Innervation of lymphoid organs and implications in development, aging, and autoimmunity Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14 :329-344 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), the primary path of nerve entry into LNs closely tracked the major blood vessels that entered the LN in the hilus region ( Figure 1 B; Video S1 ). Incoming nerve fibers preferentially traveled along a subset of blood vessels that were identified as small arteries and arterioles based on selective genetic labeling in Bmx-CreER T2 × Rosa26 eYFP/+ mice in which arterial endothelial cells (ECs) express YFP ( Ehling et al., 2013 36. Ehling, M. ∙ Adams, S. ∙ Benedito, R. ... Notch controls retinal blood vessel maturation and quiescence Development. 2013; 140 :3051-3061 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 B). In the LNs, the arborization pattern of tdTomato – TH + (putative sympathetic) neurons was notably distinct from that of tdTomato + TH – (putative sensory) neurons. Although TH + neurons primarily innervated the vasculature and often wrapped tightly around blood vessels, tdTomato + fibers displayed a different terminal morphology and not only aligned with vasculature but also branched extensively into the interstitial space ( Figure 1 B; Video S1 ).

Sensory (NaV1.8 + ) and sympathetic (TH + ) neurons are traditionally defined based on the location of their cell bodies, with the former residing in vagal ganglia or DRGs and the latter in sympathetic ganglia (SG), which each represent anatomically segregated structures that can be identified reliably. However, some Nav1.8-lineage neurons are also found in sympathetic ganglia ( Gautron et al., 2011 44. Gautron, L. ∙ Sakata, I. ∙ Udit, S. ... Genetic tracing of Nav1.8-expressing vagal afferents in the mouse J. Comp. Neurol. 2011; 519 :3085-3101 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), and TH + low-threshold mechanoreceptors are present in DRGs ( Li et al., 2011 75. Li, L. ∙ Rutlin, M. ∙ Abraira, V.E. ... The functional organization of cutaneous low-threshold mechanosensory neurons Cell. 2011; 147 :1615-1627 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ), so neither marker is truly specific. To unequivocally establish the anatomic origin of intranodal fibers, we retrogradely labeled LN-innervating neurons in DRGs and sympathetic ganglia by injecting a fluorescent neuronal tracer, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-AF488, into inguinal LNs (iLNs) of Nav1.8 Cre/+ × Rosa26 tdTomato/+ mice ( Robertson, 1990 113.

Expression of tdTomato and TH within WGA + populations revealed that more than 90% of WGA + neurons in DRGs and sympathetic ganglia were tdTomato + TH − and tdTomato − TH + , respectively, confirming that Nav1.8 and TH adequately and specifically identify sensory and sympathetic innervation of LNs ( Figures S1 D–S1H).
Having confirmed that LNs are innervated by sensory and sympathetic neurons, we next asked whether either type of innervation depended on the presence of the other. We assessed the differential sensitivity of LN-innervating neurons to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-mediated chemical sympathectomy or diphtheria toxin A (DTA)-mediated genetic ablation of Nav1.8-lineage neurons. 6-OHDA treatment efficiently depleted LNs of sympathetic fibers but had no significant effect on Nav1.8 + sensory fibers ( Figures 1 C–1E). Conversely, ablation of Nav1.8-lineage neurons in Nav1.8 Cre/+ × Rosa26 DTA/tdTomato (Nav1.8-DTA) mice ( Abrahamsen et al., 2008 1. Abrahamsen, B. ∙ Zhao, J. ∙ Asante, C.O. ... The cell and molecular basis of mechanical, cold, and inflammatory pain Science. 2008; 321 :702-705 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ) resulted in profound loss of sensory fibers without affecting TH + fibers ( Figures 1 F–1H). Thus, LNs receive mutually independent sympathetic and sensory innervation.
Next we mapped the spatial distribution of sensory fibers in LNs. LNs are anatomically divided into the lymphocyte-rich cortex, consisting of superficial B follicles and the deep T cell area, and the medulla, which connects to the hilus and contains abundant macrophages and lymphatics. The entire organ is covered by a collagen-rich capsule that is penetrated by afferent lymph vessels that discharge lymph into the subcapsular sinus (SCS), a fluid-filled space that is densely lined by specialized macrophages and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). In Nav1.8 Cre/+ × Rosa26 tdTomato/+ × Prox1-EGFP animals, in which GFP is selectively expressed in LECs ( Choi et al., 2011 24. Choi, I. ∙ Chung, H.K. ∙ Ramu, S. ... Visualization of lymphatic vessels by Prox1-promoter directed GFP reporter in a bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic mouse Blood. 2011; 117 :362-365 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), we were able to identify intranodal sensory (i.e., tdTomato + ) fibers and determine their spatial relationship to the GFP + lymphatic network and their distance to the outermost boundaries of the LN ( Figure S2 A; STAR Methods ). Any tdTomato + sensory fiber within or below the GFP + outermost LEC lining was considered intranodal. Notably, sensory fiber penetration into the LN parenchyma was relatively shallow, with an average maximum penetration distance of 112 μm ± 29 μm (mean ± SEM) below the capsule ( Figure 2 A; Video S2 ). The majority (∼60%) of intranodal sensory fibers were located less than 10 μm below the surface of popLNs ( Figure 2 B; STAR Methods ). Most of the penetrating tdTomato + fibers were located in the medulla, marked by the LEC-restricted marker LYVE-1. In contrast, tdTomato + fibers were rarely seen in the deep LN cortex ( Figure 2 C; Video S2 ).

In the more densely innervated outer cortical region of LNs, two plexuses of sensory fibers were apparent, one perivascular and the other capsular/subcapsular ( Figures 2 D). The perivascular fibers coursed through the medulla in tight association with arterioles and mostly terminated before these vessels gave rise to the capillary network. Sensory fibers were generally absent from postcapillary HEVs, the paracortical microvascular segments that express peripheral node addressin (PNAd), where blood-borne lymphocytes adhere and emigrate into LNs ( von Andrian and Mempel, 2003 136. von Andrian, U.H. ∙ Mempel, T.R. Homing and cellular traffic in lymph nodes Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3 :867-878 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 E and S2 B; Video S3 ). Occasionally, individual axons were observed branching away from the vasculature and meandering in the interstitial space ( Figure 2 E; Video S3 ). Fibers that formed the capsular/subcapsular network typically branched from larger perivascular axon bundles, ramified extensively in the collagen-rich capsule, and, in some cases, extended into and below the subcapsular space, making contact with CD169 + SCS macrophages ( Figures 2 F and S2 B–S2D; Video S3 ).

These studies indicate that the deep LN cortex, where the majority of naive lymphocytes reside, is essentially devoid of sensory innervation, whereas cells in the LN periphery, particularly those in the perivascular and subcapsular spaces, are in close proximity to sensory fibers, suggesting regionally confined functional interactions.
Next we defined the composition of LN-innervating sensory neurons using scRNA-seq ( Figure 3 A; STAR Methods ). We injected a Cre-expressing recombinant adeno-associated virus, AAV2/1-Cre (a serotype with broad tropism toward DRG neurons; Kuehn et al., 2019 67. Kuehn, E.D. ∙ Meltzer, S. ∙ Abraira, V.E. ...

Mason, M.R. ∙ Ehlert, E.M. ∙ Eggers, R. ... Comparison of AAV serotypes for gene delivery to dorsal root ganglion neurons Mol. Ther. 2010; 18 :715-724 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) into the right iLNs of Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato mice carrying a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter. Upon entry into sensory fibers, this non-replicating virus travels retrogradely to the cell body in DRGs, where virally encoded Cre recombinase induces expression of tdTomato. Following unilateral iLN injection, robust tdTomato expression was observed in neurons in the ipsilateral last thoracic (T13) and first lumbar (L1) DRGs, which supply the inguinal region ( Takahashi and Nakajima, 1996 124. Takahashi, Y. ∙ Nakajima, Y. Dermatomes in the rat limbs as determined by antidromic stimulation of sensory C-fibers in spinal nerves Pain. 1996; 67 :197-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 B–3D). TdTomato labeling at the site of injection was primarily concentrated in the injected iLNs, indicating spatial confinement of the injected material ( Figure S3 A). However, some tdTomato + cells were also detectable in the immediate vicinity of injected LNs, raising the possibility that some sensory fibers outside of the LNs were inadvertently labeled. To control for this, we assessed the extent of retrograde labeling of DRG neurons following deliberate perinodal virus injection. Relative to intranodal injections, which resulted in robust labeling of DRG neurons (16.2 ± 2.4 cells per mouse [mean ± SEM], n = 4), very few (1.5 ± 0.6, n = 4) DRG neurons were labeled after deliberate perinodal AAV2/1-Cre injection ( Figures S3 B and S3C). To independently evaluate the specificity of our retrograde viral labeling strategy, we also performed intranodal injections of AAV-Flex-tdTomato in Nav1.8 Cre animals, in which sensory neurons express Cre recombinase. The innervation pattern of retrogradely labeled tdTomato + neurons was similar to that of tdTomato + LN-innervating sensory neurons in Nav1.8 Cre/+ × Rosa26 tdTomato/+ animals, confirming their identity ( Figures 2 D and S3 D; Video S4 ).

We harvested ipsilateral T13 and L1 DRGs from AAV2/1-Cre-injected Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato animals, manually isolated individual tdTomato + neurons, and performed scRNA-seq on 52 LN-innervating sensory neurons ( Hempel et al., 2007 50.

Biol. 2014; 107 :4.22.21-17 Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar ; STAR Methods ). As a control, we also profiled 31 skin-innervating neurons from 4 Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato mice that were labeled retrogradely by intradermal AAV2/1-Cre injection ( Figure S3 E). The specificity of retrograde labeling from the skin was demonstrated by skin-restricted axonal terminals of retrogradely labeled Nav1.8 + neurons following intradermal injection of AAV2/1-Flex-EGFP into Nav1.8 Cre animals ( Figure S3 F) as well as lack of tdTomato labeling in draining LNs upon intradermal injection of AAV2/1-Cre into Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato animals (data not shown).
To define the molecular identity of LN-innervating sensory neurons, we examined each for expression of canonical markers known to differentiate at least 11 sensory neuron molecular subtypes ( Usoskin et al., 2015 130. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 E). As expected, the majority (96% with log 2 (1 + transcripts per million [TPMs]) > 1) expressed Nav1.8 ( Scn10a ), whereas few (23% with log 2 (1 + TPM) > 1) co-expressed TH ( Th ). Almost all LN neurons with detectable Nav1.8 also expressed the high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkA ( Ntrk1) , and CGRP ( Calca) , suggesting a peptidergic identity. Indeed, 88.4% ± 8.7% (mean ± SEM) of retrogradely labeled LN-innervating DRG neurons expressed CGRP by immunohistochemistry ( Figure 3 F). Notably, mutually exclusive expression of substance P ( Tac1 ) and neurofilament heavy chain (NFH; gene name Nefh ) in Calca + LN-innervating sensory neurons identified two LN-innervating peptidergic nociceptor subclasses that correspond to thermosensitive unmyelinated nociceptors and lightly myelinated Aδ nociceptors, respectively ( Usoskin et al., 2015 130. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the heterogeneous expression of Nefh , a marker for medium- to large-diameter sensory neurons with myelinated axons ( Rice and Albrecht, 2008 111. Rice, F.L. ∙ Albrecht, P.J. Cutaneous mechanisms of tactile perception: morphological and chemical organization of the innervation to the skin Academic Press, 2008 Google Scholar ), whole-mount DRG staining revealed that retrogradely labeled LN-innervating sensory neurons were heterogeneous with respect to soma size. This diversity of cell dimensions matched the range of diameters observed in CGRP + neurons, known to be heterogeneous in size ( Lawson et al., 2002 73. Lawson, S.N. ∙ Crepps, B. ∙ Perl, E.R. Calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity and afferent receptive properties of dorsal root ganglion neurones in guinea-pigs J. Physiol. 2002; 540 :989-1002 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 G). Furthermore, NFH + myelinated and NFH − unmyelinated sensory fibers were abundant in the perivascular and capsular/subcapsular space of LNs ( Figure S3 H). Because soma size and myelination status are commonly used, together with other electrophysiological properties, to classify DRG neurons into functional subtypes ( Wood et al., 2018 142. Wood, J.N. ∙ Emery, E.C. ∙ Ernfors, P. Dorsal Root Ganglion Neuron Types and Their Functional Specialization Oxford University Press, 2018 Crossref Google Scholar ), sensory neurons innervating LNs are likely composed of qualitatively distinct neuronal subtypes.
We next sought to more broadly contextualize our scRNA-seq profiles of LN-innervating sensory neurons by integrated analysis with two published scRNA-seq DRG atlases: Usoskin et al. (2015) 130. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ( Figure S4 A) and Sharma et al. (2020) 115. Sharma, N. ∙ Flaherty, K. ∙ Lezgiyeva, K. ... The emergence of transcriptional identity in somatosensory neurons Nature. 2020; 577 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ( Figures 4 A and 4B; STAR Methods ). LN-innervating sensory neurons displayed closest similarity to the peptidergic neurons defined by Usoskin et al. (2015) 130. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ( Figures S4 A and S4B) and the 4 peptidergic subtypes (called CGRP-η, -ξ, -γ, and -ε) described by Sharma et al. (2020) 115. Sharma, N. ∙ Flaherty, K. ∙ Lezgiyeva, K. ... The emergence of transcriptional identity in somatosensory neurons Nature. 2020; 577 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ( Figure 4 C). In comparison, skin-innervating neurons displayed transcriptomic phenotypes consistent with diverse neuronal subtypes, including stomatostatin (SST) + pruriceptors, MRGPRD + polymodal nociceptors, various low-threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) subtypes, and the CGRP + peptidergic subtypes represented by LN-innervating neurons. Next, we directly classified LN-innervating or skin-innervating sensory neurons relative to the 11 DRG subtypes in the Usoskin et al. (2015) 130. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar atlas and the 15 in the Sharma et al. (2020) 115. Sharma, N. ∙ Flaherty, K. ∙ Lezgiyeva, K. ... The emergence of transcriptional identity in somatosensory neurons Nature. 2020; 577 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar atlas ( STAR Methods ; Figures 4 D and S4C). We recovered 4 transcriptionally distinct neuronal classes in our dataset, called neuron types 1–4. Each neuron type was represented, albeit in different proportions, in LN-innervating and skin-innervating sensory neurons, demonstrating intrinsic heterogeneity in sensory neurons innervating the same target as well as innervation target-dependent differences in subtype composition (p < 0.001 by Pearson’s chi-square test; Figure 4 E). Using differential gene expression analysis, we discovered unique gene modules that cleanly define each neuron type ( Figure 4 F; Table S1 ). These were consistent with the general phenotypic descriptions of the corresponding subtypes in Sharma et al. (2020) 115. Sharma, N. ∙ Flaherty, K. ∙ Lezgiyeva, K. ... The emergence of transcriptional identity in somatosensory neurons Nature. 2020; 577 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar and Usoskin et al. (2015) 130.

Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar . Together, these data suggest that LN-innervating sensory neurons are transcriptionally heterogeneous but strongly biased toward peptidergic phenotypes.
We next compared LN- and skin-innervating sensory neurons to define gene programs that may support target tissue-specific development and function. We identified 101 and 156 genes that were significantly upregulated in LN-innervating and skin-innervating neurons, respectively ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S4 D, and S4E; Table S1 ). Analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes and gene ontologies revealed that LN- and skin-innervating sensory neurons differ with respect to many surface ion channels and synaptic proteins (LN-specific: Trpc4 , Trpm8 , Kcnh5 , and Ache ; skin-specific: Trpc3 , Trpc6 , Kctd16 , Synpr , Gabra1 , and Kcnk12 ), as well as secreted and cell surface molecules, which may reflect target-specific modes of communication between sensory neurons and their microenvironment ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S4 F–S4H). LN-innervating sensory neurons overexpressed genes with inflammatory or immune cell interacting activities, including Tbxa2r , Il33 , Ptgir , and Cd1d , suggesting additional immunological functions, including the capacity to monitor LN inflammatory state by sensing inflammation-induced prostanoids that may reach LNs via lymph or that are produced directly in reactive LNs ( Figures 5 C and 5D; Table S1 ; Andoh et al., 2007 5.

Physiol. 2002; 282 :H482-H490 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify candidate markers for LN-innervating neurons, we compared these neurons to skin-innervating neurons and the full diversity of sensory neurons captured in the Sharma et al. (2020) 115. Sharma, N. ∙ Flaherty, K. ∙ Lezgiyeva, K. ... The emergence of transcriptional identity in somatosensory neurons Nature. 2020; 577 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar atlas ( Table S1 ; Figure 5 E). We validated Ptgir and Prokr2 , two markers with different sensitivity and specificity, as LN-innervating sensory neurons markers ( Figures 4 F, S4 D, and S4E) using RNAscope-based multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of Ptgir , Prokr2 , and tdTomato in DRGs containing tdTomato + retrogradely labeled LN- or skin-innervating neurons ( Figures 5 F and S4 I–S4L). Thus, sensory neurons innervating LNs are marked by a distinct transcriptional profile that includes high expression of Ptgir and Prokr2 .
Previous work has shown that sensory innervation often increases at sites of inflammation ( Chakrabarty et al., 2011 19. Chakrabarty, A. ∙ McCarson, K.E. ∙ Smith, P.G. Hypersensitivity and hyperinnervation of the rat hind paw following carrageenan-induced inflammation Neurosci. Lett. 2011; 495 :67-71 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pongratz and Straub, 2013 104. Pongratz, G. ∙ Straub, R.H. Role of peripheral nerve fibres in acute and chronic inflammation in arthritis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2013; 9 :117-126 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that sensory neuronal networks may undergo remodeling when exposed to inflammatory signals. Indeed, LN-innervating sensory neurons expressed several Toll-like receptors (TLRs), innate sensors of pro-inflammatory molecular patterns associated with pathogens or tissue damage ( Akira et al., 2006 4. Akira, S. ∙ Uematsu, S. ∙ Takeuchi, O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity Cell. 2006; 124 :783-801 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7475) PubMed Google Scholar ; Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002 60. Janeway, Jr., C.A. ∙ Medzhitov, R. Innate immune recognition Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20 :197-216 Crossref Scopus (5527) PubMed Google Scholar ), including Tlr4 (40% of LN-innervating neurons assayed), Tlr5 (25%), Tlr3 (15%), and Tlr6 (6%) ( Figure S4 M). Thus, we assessed the structural plasticity of sensory innervation of LNs in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prototypic TLR4 ligand ( Chow et al., 1999 25. Chow, J.C. ∙ Young, D.W. ∙ Golenbock, D.T. ... Toll-like receptor-4 mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced signal transduction J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :10689-10692 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1518) PubMed Google Scholar ) by comparing the innervation patterns of reactive and contralateral PBS-draining popLNs on day 3 following LPS footpad injection in Nav1.8 Cre/+ × Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato mice ( Figures 5 G–5J). LPS challenge consistently led to a selective 2-fold increase in total sensory fiber content in draining LNs (p < 0.05; Figures 5 G, 5I, and 5J). This increase in sensory innervation tightly paralleled a concomitant increase in total LN volume, and sensory fiber density remained essentially constant regardless of the inflammatory state of the LN ( Figures 5 H and S4 N). To determine whether the expansion of sensory innervation upon peripheral TLR exposure required direct recognition of TLR ligand, we also injected mice subcutaneously with Pam3CSK4, a ligand for TLR1 and TLR2 ( Jin et al., 2007 61. Jin, M.S. ∙ Kim, S.E. ∙ Heo, J.Y. ... Crystal structure of the TLR1-TLR2 heterodimer induced by binding of a tri-acylated lipopeptide Cell. 2007; 130 :1071-1082 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (869) PubMed Google Scholar ), which are both absent from LN sensory neurons ( Figure S4 M). Compared with LPS-treated mice, Pam3CSK4 elicited not only similar LN expansion ( Figure S4 O) but also a similar enhancement of sensory innervation ( Figures 5 K–5N). Therefore, in certain cases, expanded innervation likely arises through indirect sensing of TLR-induced secondary inflammatory mediators, potentially involving communication with other LN-resident cell types and/or detection of secreted factors from the periphery.
To identify potential interaction partners for LN-innervating sensory neurons, we next systematically mapped putative cellular interactions between sensory neurons and the various cell types that reside in LNs. First we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of steady-state murine iLNs using Seq-Well ( Aicher et al., 2019 3. Aicher, T.P. ∙ Carroll, S. ∙ Raddi, G. ... Seq-Well: A Sample-Efficient, Portable Picowell Platform for Massively Parallel Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1979 :111-132 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gierahn et al., 2017 45. Gierahn, T.M. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Hughes, T.K. ... Seq-Well: portable, low-cost RNA sequencing of single cells at high throughput Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :395-398 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ; STAR Methods ). To increase coverage of rare LN cell types (i.e., non-T and non-B cells) that populate the preferentially innervated LN periphery, we profiled paired LN samples from before and after immuno-magnetic depletion of T and B cells ( Figure 6 A). Following quality filtering and preprocessing, we recovered libraries from 9,622 single cells. Using established methods for unbiased cell type identification, we uncovered 24 distinct cell types representing all major known lymphoid, myeloid, and stromal LN populations ( Butler et al., 2018 18. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (1532) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 6 B, 6C, and S5A–5P ; Table S2 ; STAR Methods ).
To determine the relative likelihood of each LN cell type interacting with LN-innervating sensory neurons, we analyzed the expression of ligand-receptor pairs across our two single-cell datasets ( Cohen et al., 2018 27.

The enteric nervous system of the human and mouse colon at single-cell resolution Cell. 2019; 182 :1606-1622.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4) Google Scholar ). We reasoned that interacting cells might rely on inter-cellular ligand-receptor pairs for signaling crosstalk and/or physical association through interaction of membrane-anchored proteins or via secreted ligands binding to receptors. Accordingly, the number of co-expressed ligand-receptor cognates between a LN-innervating neuron and any given LN cell type was used to estimate the “interaction potential” for that LN cell type ( Figures 6 D, 6E, and S6 A; STAR Methods ). The non-immune compartment (non-endothelial stroma [NES], blood vessel ECs [BEC], high ECs [HEC], and two LEC subsets [LEC 1 and LEC 2]) exhibited the highest interaction potential among all LN cell types and reached statistical significance compared with randomized data ( Figure 6 E; S6 B–S6E; STAR Methods ). To take into consideration the directionality of the cognate pairs, we partitioned ligand-receptor pairs into three categories: (1) the gene product is secreted by LN-innervating neuron, (2) secreted by LN-resident cell types, or (3) non-directional/unknown directionality, often corresponding to interactions between two membrane-tethered proteins. Considering only molecules secreted by LN-innervating neurons (category 1), LEC 2, LEC 1, BECs, HECs, and NESs expressed a significantly elevated abundance of cognate receptors ( Figure 6 F). Given a strong enrichment for peptidergic signatures among LN-innervating neurons, we assessed expression of the corresponding neuropeptide receptors among LN cell types ( Figure S6 F). Ramp1 , which, together with Calcrl , a ubiquitously expressed gene among LN cell types, forms the CGRP receptor ( McLatchie et al., 1998 85. McLatchie, L.M. ∙ Fraser, N.J. ∙ Main, M.J. ... RAMPs regulate the transport and ligand specificity of the calcitonin-receptor-like receptor Nature. 1998; 393 :333-339 Crossref Scopus (1722) PubMed Google Scholar ), was more highly expressed in innate immune cell types such as mast cells and DCs, suggesting that LN-innervating sensory neurons may signal to select myeloid cells via CGRP. The receptors for other neuropeptides, Tac1 , Adcyap1 , and Gal ( Tacr1 , Adcyap1r1 , and Galr2 and Galr1 , respectively), were uniquely expressed by NESs, identifying substance P, PACAP, and galanin as potential signaling mediators between LN-innervating neurons and NESs. Notably, the recently identified alternative substance P receptor Mrgprb2 was almost exclusively and highly expressed in LN mast cells, suggesting a substance P/Mrgprb2-mediated sensory neuron-mast cell connection analogous to what has been described in the skin ( Green et al., 2019 48. Green, D.P. ∙ Limjunyawong, N. ∙ Gour, N. ... A Mast-Cell-Specific Receptor Mediates Neurogenic Inflammation and Pain Neuron. 2019; 101 :412-420.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, classic neuropeptides did not appear to be a primary mode of communication between LN-innervating sensory neurons and LN ECs.
Next we analyzed the cognate receptors and ligands responsible for high interaction potentials among the stromal compartments ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Predicted interaction between LN-innervating neurons and NESs was strongly driven by extracellular matrix components ( Col3a1 , Col5a2 , Col5a1 , Col6a1 , Col6a2 , Col6a3 , Col1a2 , Col1a2 , Lama2 , Thbs2 , and Fn1 ) and growth factors/chemokines with diverse roles in neuronal development and function ( Vegfa , Ptn , Mdk , and Cxcl12 ) ( González-Castillo et al., 2015 47.

Similarly, the putative interactions between BECs and HECs with LN-innervating sensory neurons were potentially bidirectional, as evidenced by expression of a distinct set of extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules ( Lama5 , Itga5 , and Hspg2 ), receptors of central signaling pathways for vascular development ( Flt1 , Notch4 , and Fzd4 ) ( Mack and Iruela-Arispe, 2018 78.

Thus, our single-cell profiling identified stromal cells as the most likely interacting partners of LN-innervating sensory neurons and revealed potential communication modalities for cell-cell interactions.
To directly test functional interactions between LN-innervating sensory neurons and LN cells, we systematically interrogated the effects of acute activation of LN-innervating sensory neurons on LN-resident cell gene expression by integrating optogenetic stimulation with scRNA-seq ( STAR Methods ). To specifically activate LN-innervating sensory neurons in vivo , we used Nav1.8 Cre/+ × Rosa26 ChR2-eYFP/+ (ChR2+) mice in which Nav1.8-lineage neurons expressed ChR2 ( Deisseroth, 2011 30. Deisseroth, K. Optogenetics Nat. Methods. 2011; 8 :26-29 Crossref Scopus (1066) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sensory neurons innervating surgically exposed iLNs were activated selectively using blue light (473 nm) through an optical fiber directed at a region around the subiliac artery adjacent to the hilus, the predominant site where sensory nerve bundles enter the iLNs ( Figures 1 A, 1B, 7 A, and S7 A).
Following 3 h of pulsed light exposure, iLNs from the stimulated and unstimulated sides were processed in parallel and analyzed using Seq-Well ( Figures 7 A and S7 B). To isolate the ChR2-dependent effect of optogenetic activation, iLNs in a separate cohort of Nav1.8 Cre/+ × Rosa26 eYFP/+ (ChR2 − ) animals, which expressed eYFP instead of ChR2 in Nav1.8-lineage neurons, were subjected to identical photostimulation, dissociation, cellular enrichment, and scRNA-seq analysis ( STAR Methods ). The changes in cellular composition and gene expression in ChR2 + , but not ChR2 − (i.e., eYFP + ), animals were considered true effects of local stimulation of LN sensory fibers ( Figure S7 C; STAR Methods ). Our final dataset included 4 ChR2 + mice and 3 ChR2 − mice, two iLNs per mouse (one light-exposed, one control), and contained 10,364 cells ( STAR Methods ; Figures 6 B, 7 B, S7 D). Compared with the contralateral control iLN, we did not observe significant light-induced changes in the abundance of any cell type in ChR2 + or ChR2 − animals, nor did we observe changes in LN cellularity upon light exposure ( Figures S7 E and S7F), indicating that neither the surgical/photostimulation procedures nor activation of LN-innervating sensory neurons dramatically altered the ecosystem of the exposed iLNs over the relatively short timescale of 3 h.
We next compared gene expression between the same cell types in ChR2 + light-exposed LNs and ChR2 + contralateral control LNs ( Table S3 ; STAR Methods ). Remarkably, robust ChR2-dependent transcriptional changes were readily detected in a subset of cell types—LEC 2, BECs, NESs, neutrophil 2, and natural killer (NK) cells—indicating selective modulatory capabilities of LN-innervating sensory neurons ( Figures 7 C–7F and S7 G). Further, we found that the magnitude of change in gene expression (as measured by the number of DE genes) was correlated significantly with the overall interaction potential ( Figure 6 E) derived from the steady-state iLN atlas (Pearson correlation = 0.52, p < 0.03; Figures 7 G and S7 G).
The most affected LN cell type was LEC 2, based on the abundance of DE genes with substantial effect sizes ( Figure S7 G). LEC 2 were also the cell type with the highest overall interaction potential ( Figures 6 E, and 7 G) and were characterized by high expression of potential molecular pathways for bidirectional interaction with LN-innervating neurons, including extracellular matrix molecules ( Tnc , Fbn1 , and Nid1 ), synaptic proteins ( Agrn , Nrxn2 , and Nlgn2 ) ( Südhof, 2018 122.

Interestingly, some interaction-capable molecules, such as Reln , F8 , Itgb3 , and Nrp2 , were downregulated following neuronal stimulation, suggesting a potential negative feedback loop that may act to maintain or restore homeostasis by limiting the effect of neuronal stimulation on LEC 2 when initiated ( Figure 7 I). Among neuronal stimulation-induced gene expression changes in LEC 2, which were dominated by downregulation, there was overrepresentation of genes in multiple pathways involved in neuronal synapses and dendrite projection, ceramidase activity, cathepsin expression, and antigen processing and presentation and multiple transcriptional regulators, including Gata6 , Ets2 , Irf7 , and Nfatc1 ( Figure 7 J). We observed a general trend toward downregulation of LEC-enriched genes, including key regulators of lymphatic development and patterning (e.g., Reln , Nrp2 , Ephb4 , Nfatc1 , and Lyve1 ), as well as angiogenic molecules (e.g., Dlg1 and Glul ), suggesting anti-angiogenic and/or anti-lymphangiogenic action of LN-innervating sensory neurons ( Cho et al., 2019 23.

Zhang, G. ∙ Brady, J. ∙ Liang, W.C. ... EphB4 forward signalling regulates lymphatic valve development Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6625 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, downregulation of ceramidases (i.e., Acer2 and Asah2 , implicated in production of sphingosine-1-phosphate [S1P] in LECs, a major source of S1P in lymph) may affect lymphocyte egress from LNs, a process known to be under the control of adrenergic nerves ( Mao and Obeid, 2008 81. Mao, C. ∙ Obeid, L.M. Ceramidases: regulators of cellular responses mediated by ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate Biochim. Biophys.

Med. 2010; 207 :17-27 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the observation that LEC 2 exhibited the largest neuronal activation-evoked transcriptional changes, direct contact between sensory nerves and LECs was observed frequently in the medulla and on the ceiling of the SCS ( Figures 7 K and 7L). These data further suggest that sensory neurons innervating LNs, when activated, may rapidly modulate the non-immune compartment to influence LN composition and/or function.

Section: Discussion

Despite their critical roles in regulating immunological processes in barrier tissues and the spleen ( Chavan et al., 2017 20. Chavan, S.S. ∙ Pavlov, V.A. ∙ Tracey, K.J. Mechanisms and Therapeutic Relevance of Neuro-immune Communication Immunity. 2017; 46 :927-942 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2015 98.

The Regulation of Immunological Processes by Peripheral Neurons in Homeostasis and Disease Trends Immunol. 2015; 36 :578-604 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), neuroimmune interactions, particularly those involving somatosensory neurons, have yet to be studied systematically in LNs. Here we directly addressed this gap in knowledge by analyzing the morphological, molecular, and functional attributes of the sensory neurons that innervate peripheral LNs. Our study identifies a sensory neuron-stroma axis in LNs as a previously unappreciated circuit of peripheral neuroimmune communication.
Previous light and electron microscopic studies have revealed the localization of peptidergic fibers in LNs ( Felten et al., 1985 39. Felten, D.L. ∙ Felten, S.Y. ∙ Carlson, S.L. ... Noradrenergic and peptidergic innervation of lymphoid tissue J. Immunol. 1985; 135 :755s-765s PubMed Google Scholar ; Fink and Weihe, 1988 41. Fink, T. ∙ Weihe, E. Multiple neuropeptides in nerves supplying mammalian lymph nodes: messenger candidates for sensory and autonomic neuroimmunomodulation? Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 90 :39-44 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the extent to which those fibers reflect sensory innervation had not been assessed directly. Here we demonstrate the definitive presence of sensory innervation in LNs. We found that bona fide sensory fibers organized into two nerve plexuses: one perivascular and another capsular/subcapsular. The perivascular plexus is particularly concentrated in the medulla and preferentially associated with arterioles and medullary LECs, whereas fibers in the capsular/subcapsular plexus are in close contact with other LN-resident cells, such as SCS macrophages and LECs. By using a whole-mount immunolabeling protocol, we reliably identified and visualized in 3D the entire network of neuronal fibers to quantitatively describe LN neuronal architecture. Through genetic labeling and retrograde tracing of LN sensory innervation, we performed unbiased morphological characterization of this heterogeneous neuronal population.
Our analysis revealed that sensory fibers are enriched in the LN periphery, a location prone to inflammation-induced mechanical, chemical, and cellular changes, suggesting a potential role of those neurons as local sentinels of LN activation. Consistent with this idea, we observed sensory hyperinnervation of LNs as a response to TLR stimulation at a distal site, potentially contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in certain types of infection. Although the exact type(s) of stimuli LN sensory neurons are tuned to and the nature of the neuronal response to diverse challenges have yet to be defined, there are multiple plausible sensing mechanisms through which LN-innervating sensory neurons could detect changes in immune status. For example, immune challenges in the periphery often result in local production of inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or IL-1β, that may become lymph-borne and directly stimulate or sensitize LN-innervating sensory neurons via their cognate cytokine receptors; i.e., TNFR1 ( Tnfrsf1a ) or IL-1R ( Il1r1 ), respectively. It is also likely that sensory fibers, particularly those embedded in the LN capsule, can sense changing mechanical forces as a result of inflammation-induced LN expansion. Indeed, most DRG neurons display mechanosensitivity, albeit to different degrees ( Drew et al., 2002 33. Drew, L.J. ∙ Wood, J.N. ∙ Cesare, P. Distinct mechanosensitive properties of capsaicin-sensitive and -insensitive sensory neurons J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 :RC228 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Hu and Lewin, 2006 53. Hu, J. ∙ Lewin, G.R.

Lett. 1999; 273 :179-182 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, LN-innervating sensory neurons are likely particularly sensitive to mechanical stimuli experienced in the LN periphery because most express high levels of mRNA for the mechanically gated ion channel Piezo2 , the major mechanotransducer for touch, proprioception, baroreception, and airway stretch ( Nonomura et al., 2017 94.

PIEZOs mediate neuronal sensing of blood pressure and the baroreceptor reflex Science. 2018; 362 :464-467 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is also growing evidence of direct activation of sensory neurons by infectious pathogens. For example, nociceptors in barrier tissues have been shown to detect bacterial products, such as pore-forming toxins (PFTs), N-formyl peptides, and endotoxin ( Blake et al., 2018 13. Blake, K.J. ∙ Baral, P. ∙ Voisin, T. ... Staphylococcus aureus produces pain through pore-forming toxins and neuronal TRPV1 that is silenced by QX-314 Nat.

TRPA1 channels mediate acute neurogenic inflammation and pain produced by bacterial endotoxins Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3125 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conceivably, intact microbes and/or microbial products carried by the lymph may be similarly detected by sensory fibers in LNs. Consistent with this idea, we found that LN-innervating sensory neurons expressed mRNA for LPS receptors; i.e., TLR4 and TrpA1 as well as Adam10 , the receptor for α-hemolysin, a PFT from S. aureus ( Diogenes et al., 2011 31. Diogenes, A. ∙ Ferraz, C.C. ∙ Akopian, A.N. ... LPS sensitizes TRPV1 via activation of TLR4 in trigeminal sensory neurons J. Dent.

USA. 2010; 107 :13473-13478 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, exposure of LN-innervating sensory fibers to the content of afferent lymph is also a potential vulnerability to incoming neurotropic pathogens. For example, subcutaneous challenge of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) results in rapid transport of infectious lymph-borne virions to the draining LNs, where VSV can invade peripheral neurons to cause fatal ascending infection of the CNS ( Iannacone et al., 2010 57. Iannacone, M. ∙ Moseman, E.A. ∙ Tonti, E. ... Subcapsular sinus macrophages prevent CNS invasion on peripheral infection with a neurotropic virus Nature. 2010; 465 :1079-1083 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the anatomic origin and identity of VSV-susceptible nerve fibers in LNs remain to be formally established, their morphology and location in the subcapsular/capsular space are consistent with them being of sensory origin.
Identification of LEC 2 as top targets of LN-innervating sensory neurons is particularly intriguing because local sensory afferents have been implicated in regulation of antigen, lymph, and lymphocyte flow through LNs, processes that are controlled by LECs ( Hanes et al., 2016 49. Hanes, W.M. ∙ Olofsson, P.S. ∙ Talbot, S. ... Neuronal circuits modulate antigen flow through lymph nodes Bioelectron. Med. 2016; 3 :18-28 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Moore et al., 1989 90. Moore, T.C. ∙ Lami, J.L. ∙ Spruck, C.H. Substance P increases lymphocyte traffic and lymph flow through peripheral lymph nodes of sheep Immunology. 1989; 67 :109-114 PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether and to what extent the communication between sensory neurons and LEC 2 contributes to those processes will require a better understanding of the distribution and function of LEC 2 within LNs. Using a recently published resource describing the transcriptional diversity and identity of LECs in human LNs ( Takeda et al., 2019 125. Takeda, A. ∙ Hollmen, M. ∙ Dermadi, D. ... Single-Cell Survey of Human Lymphatics Unveils Marked Endothelial Cell Heterogeneity and Mechanisms of Homing for Neutrophils Immunity. 2019; 51 :561-572.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), we further contextualized our two murine LEC subsets. In the LEC 2 cluster, we found cells with elevated expression of Emcn , Ackr2 , Ackr4 , Cav1 , and Fabp4 , which suggests high similarity with LECs found in the SCS ceiling, afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels, as well as the cortical sinuses. Of note, two ceramidases, Acer2 and Asah2 , implicated in S1P biosynthesis, were downregulated by optogenetic stimulation in LEC 2, suggesting that sensory neurons may affect lymphocyte trafficking by regulating S1P-mediated lymphocyte egress from LNs ( Mao and Obeid, 2008 81. Mao, C. ∙ Obeid, L.M. Ceramidases: regulators of cellular responses mediated by ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781 :424-434 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pappu et al., 2007 100. Pappu, R. ∙ Schwab, S.R. ∙ Cornelissen, I. ... Promotion of lymphocyte egress into blood and lymph by distinct sources of sphingosine-1-phosphate Science. 2007; 316 :295-298 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pham et al., 2010 101. Pham, T.H. ∙ Baluk, P. ∙ Xu, Y. ... Lymphatic endothelial cell sphingosine kinase activity is required for lymphocyte egress and lymphatic patterning J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207 :17-27 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). This could either reflect direct efferent communication between sensory neurons and LEC 2 or involve an efferent autonomic reflex triggered by afferent sensory signals. Consistent with the latter, sympathetic neurons have been previously shown to suppress lymphocyte egress from LNs ( Nakai et al., 2014 92. Nakai, A. ∙ Hayano, Y. ∙ Furuta, F. ... Control of lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes through β2-adrenergic receptors J. Exp. Med. 2014; 211 :2583-2598 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, sensory and sympathetic LN fibers may act together or independently to regulate the dwell time of recirculating lymphocytes within LNs, potentially fine-tuning antigen encounters and the ensuing adaptive immune response.
In the immune compartment, certain innate leukocytes, including neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, were also targets of optogenetically stimulated sensory fibers, whereas the bulk of adaptive lymphocytes remained essentially unaffected. Of note, a nociceptor-neutrophil communication axis has been identified recently as a major immunosuppressive mechanism in mouse models of S. aureus -induced pneumonia and S. pyogenes -induced necrotizing fasciitis ( Baral et al., 2018 8. Baral, P. ∙ Umans, B.D. ∙ Li, L. ... Nociceptor sensory neurons suppress neutrophil and γδ T cell responses in bacterial lung infections and lethal pneumonia Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :417-426 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2018 103. Pinho-Ribeiro, F.A. ∙ Baddal, B. ∙ Haarsma, R. ... Blocking Neuronal Signaling to Immune Cells Treats Streptococcal Invasive Infection Cell. 2018; 173 :1083-1097.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether nociceptor-neutrophil communication exerts similar immunomodulatory activities in LNs remains to be determined. Somewhat unexpectedly, interactions between sensory fibers and DCs in LNs were notably limited, at least within the experimental parameters of this study. This distinguishes LNs from peripheral barrier tissues, where nociceptors are necessary and sufficient to drive IL-23 production by dermal DCs, resulting in type 17 inflammation ( Kashem et al., 2015 63. Kashem, S.W. ∙ Riedl, M.S. ∙ Yao, C. ... Nociceptive Sensory Fibers Drive Interleukin-23 Production from CD301b+ Dermal Dendritic Cells and Drive Protective Cutaneous Immunity Immunity. 2015; 43 :515-526 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ; Riol-Blanco et al., 2014 112.

Nociceptive sensory neurons drive interleukin-23-mediated psoriasiform skin inflammation Nature. 2014; 510 :157-161 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is important to note that neither in silico nor optogenetic analyses can rule out DCs or, for that matter, adaptive T or B cells as direct or indirect interacting partners of sensory neurons in LNs.
In conclusion, we established LNs as a point of convergence between the sensory nervous system and the immune system by identifying a molecularly distinct and heterogeneous population of sensory neurons with the capacity to affect LN function and homeostasis. We speculate that the heterogeneous, unique composition of LN-innervating sensory neurons may be an essential feature for continuous monitoring of the immune status of LNs, which may vary widely in magnitude and quality based on the type of challenge. Although further investigation will be needed, it is intriguing to hypothesize that specific immune triggers may also engage one or more subtype(s) of LN sensory neurons with distinct immunomodulatory capacities to customize immune activity, appropriately or maladaptively, for any given insult.
The primary focus of this study was the identification and characterization of LN-innervating sensory neurons and their cellular communication partners at the anatomic and molecular levels. Although our analysis provides clues regarding how sensory neurons may monitor and modulate pathophysiological processes in LNs, it will be important to further establish their functional effect experimentally. For example, we show that LN-innervating neurons regulate, in LN LECs, the expression of enzymes involved in S1P metabolism, known to control lymphocyte egress. What, then, is the role of sensory innervation in lymphocyte homing to or egress from LNs at steady state and following inflammatory challenge? In theory, controlled optogenetic stimulation of LN-innervating fibers, as performed here, could address this question. However, to observe responses beyond short-term effects (e.g., changes in lymphocyte trafficking), longer time intervals of optogenetic stimulation would be required, and the unavoidable surgical preparation and prolonged exposure to highly energetic laser light would ultimately result in confounding local inflammation and tissue deterioration. Alternative, less invasive experimental strategies to assay how LN-innervating neurons affect cellular dynamics need to be explored, and development of strategies to specifically ablate or inactivate LN-innervating sensory neurons will be critical to answer many outstanding questions. Finally, additional work will also be essential to understand the scope and context-dependent roles of LN-innervating neurons in response to a variety of pathogens and inflammatory challenges.

USA. 2004; 101 :12706-12711 Crossref Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ), Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato (RRID:IMSR_JAX:007914), Bmx-CreER T2 (MGI: 5513853 ) ( Ehling et al., 2013 36. Ehling, M. ∙ Adams, S. ∙ Benedito, R. ... Notch controls retinal blood vessel maturation and quiescence Development. 2013; 140 :3051-3061 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ), Rosa26 LSL-DTA (RRID:IMSR_JAX:009669), Prox1-EGFP (MGI: 4847348 ) ( Choi et al., 2011 24. Choi, I. ∙ Chung, H.K. ∙ Ramu, S. ... Visualization of lymphatic vessels by Prox1-promoter directed GFP reporter in a bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic mouse Blood. 2011; 117 :362-365 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), Rosa26 LSL-ChR2-eYFP (RRID:IMSR_JAX:024109), Rosa26 LSL-eYFP (RRID:IMSR_JAX:007903) and ChAT BAC -eGFP (RRID:IMSR_JAX: 007902). All of the animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocols of Harvard Medical School. Unless indicated otherwise, adult mice of both sexes between 6-12 weeks of age were used for various experiments.
Whole mount immunohistochemistry of LNs was performed using an iDISCO protocol with methanol pretreatment optimized for LNs ( Renier et al., 2014 110. Renier, N. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Simon, D.J. ... iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging Cell. 2014; 159 :896-910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, adult animals (6-12 weeks) were perfused with 25 mL of PBS (Hyclone) and 25 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma) sequentially at room temperature (RT). Peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs), including popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes (popLNs and iLNs), were postfixed with 4% PFA for 1 hr at 4°C. For methanol pretreatment, fixed LNs were washed sequentially in 50% methanol (Fisher Scientific) (in PBS) for 1 hr, 100% methanol for 1 hr, 50% methanol for 1 hr, PBS for 1 hr twice, and PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 (VWR) for 1 hr twice at RT. LNs were then left in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100/20% DMSO (Sigma)/0.3 M glycine (BioRad) overnight at RT and blocked in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100/10% DMSO/6% donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) or goat serum (GIBCO)/anti-CD16/CD32 (Fc block) (Bio X cell) overnight at RT. LNs were subsequently washed in PBS/0.2% Tween-20 (Fisher Scientific)/10 μg/mL heparin (Sigma) (PTwH), for 1 hr twice at RT, before incubation with antibody mix in PTwH/5% DMSO/3% donkey or goat serum/Fc block 1:100 for 3 days at RT. LNs were extensively washed in PTwH for at least 6 times over the course of a day at RT. For unconjugated antibodies, LNs were further incubated with a secondary antibody mix including a panel of species-specific anti-IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluro 488, 546, 647 and 594-conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen or Jackson Immunoresearch) in PTwH/5% DMSO/3% donkey or goat serum/Fc block 1:100 for 3 more days at RT. LNs were washed in the same way as after primary antibody incubation for 1 day. Immunolabeled LNs following one round of antibody incubation for conjugated antibodies (or two for unconjugated antibodies) were then processed for clearing, which includes sequential incubation with 50% methanol for 1 hr, 100% methanol for 1 hr for three times and a mixture of 1-part benzyl alcohol (Sigma): 2-parts benzyl benzoate (Sigma) (BABB) overnight at RT. For tdTomato immunolabeling, goat anti-mCherry antibody (ACRIS) was preabsorbed against PLNs from tdTomato - animals overnight at RT prior to use.
Whole mount immunohistochemistry of DRGs and the skin was performed as described previously ( Li et al., 2011 75. Li, L. ∙ Rutlin, M. ∙ Abraira, V.E. ... The functional organization of cutaneous low-threshold mechanosensory neurons Cell. 2011; 147 :1615-1627 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, DRGs inside vertebral column and the depilated hairy skin from PFA-perfused animals (6-12 weeks) were postfixed with 4% PFA for 1 hr or Zamboni fixative (Fisher Scientific) overnight, respectively at 4°C. Samples were washed every 30 min with PBS/0.3% Triton-100 (0.3% PBST) for 4-6 hr, then incubated with primary antibodies in antibody diluent (0.3% PBST/20% DMSO/5% donkey or goat serum) for 2-3 days at RT. Samples were then washed with 0.3% PBST every 30 min for 5–8 hr before incubation with secondary antibodies in antibody diluent for 2-3 days at RT. After extensive washes as described above, samples were dehydrated and cleared in 50% methanol for 1 hr, 100% methanol for 1 hr for three times and BABB overnight at RT.
Cleared whole-mount tissues were imaged in BABB between two coverglasses using Olympus FV3000 confocal imaging system, except for those shown in Figures 7 K and 7L, which were acquired on BioRad 2100MP system and those shown in Figures 3 B, S3 B, and S3E, which were acquired on Zeiss Stereo Discovery V16. The antibodies used were: rabbit anti-CGRP (Immunostar, 24112, 1:500), chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs, GFP-1020, 1:500), chicken anti-NF200 (Aves Labs, NFH, 1:500), rabbit anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase (Millipore, AB152, 1:500), goat anti mCherry antibody (1:500, ACRIS AB0040-200), rabbit anti-βIII-Tubulin (Biolegend, 802001, 1:500), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated rat anti-CD31 (Biolegend, 102416, 1:50), FITC–conjugated mouse anti-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) (Sigma, F3777-.2ML, 1:500), eFluor 660-conjugated mouse anti-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) (Thermo Fisher, 50-9760-82, 1:100), eFluor 660-conjugated rat anti-CD169 (Thermo Fisher, 50-5755-80, 1:50), Pacific Blue-conjugated rat anti-CD45 (Biolegend, 103126, 1:50), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rat anti-PNAd (Thermo Fisher, 53-6036-82, 1:50)
To retrogradely label LN-innervating neurons, adult animals (6-12 weeks) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (Patterson Vet) (50 mg kg -1 ) and xylazine (Patterson Vet) (10 mg kg -1 ). The skin overlying the targeted iLN was shaved and depilated so that the LN underneath was visible percutaneously. A 5 mm incision was made directly on top of the iLN. The iLN was microdissected without perturbing afferent lymphatic vessels and surrounding blood vessels. 1 μL of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) (AAV2/1.CMV.HI.eGFP-Cre.WPRE.SV40, titer > = 8E+12 vg/mL, Addgene) mixed with 0.5 μL of fast green (Sigma) was injected into the iLN of Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato animals using a pulled and trimmed glass pipette (FHC) which was connected to a 5 mL syringe through the aspiration assembly system (Sigma). The injection site was immediately rinsed with 2 mL of saline (Patterson Vet) to wash away any off-target virus before the incision was closed with sutures. Animals were sacrificed between 1 month and 6 months after injection for histology or scRNA-seq. To directly visualize the axonal projections of sensory neurons retrogradely labeled from the iLN, AAV carrying Cre-dependent tdTomato cassette (AAV2/1.CAG.Flex.tdTomato.WPRE.bGH, titer ≥ 10 13 vg/mL, Addgene) was injected into the iLN Nav1.8 Cre/+ animals as described above. For WGA-based retrograde labeling, 1 μL of WGA-AF488 (2 mg/mL in PBS, Invitrogen) was injected into the iLN of Nav1.8 Cre/+ ; Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/+ animals as described before and the animals were processed for histology 4 days post injection. Retrograde labeling of skin-innervating neurons was described previously ( Kuehn et al., 2019 67. Kuehn, E.D. ∙ Meltzer, S. ∙ Abraira, V.E. ... Tiling and somatotopic alignment of mammalian low-threshold mechanoreceptors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :9168-9177 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, following ketamine-xylazine mediated anesthesia, a single injection of 0.2 μL of various AAV2/1 viruses as described above and 0.1 μL of fast green was delivered using the injection device described above intradermally into the patch of depilated skin overlying the iLN of adult mice (6-12 weeks). Animals were sacrificed between 1 month and 6 months after injection for immunohistochemistry, RNAscope, or scRNA-seq.
Adult animals (6-12 weeks) were perfused with 25 mL of PBS and 25 mL of 4% PFA sequentially at RT. The intact vertebral column was postfixed overnight with 4% PFA at 4°C. DRGs were subsequently dissected and processed for cryosectioning. 14 μm serial cryosections were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously ( Li et al., 2011 75. Li, L. ∙ Rutlin, M. ∙ Abraira, V.E. ... The functional organization of cutaneous low-threshold mechanosensory neurons Cell. 2011; 147 :1615-1627 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, sections were postfixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at RT. Following three washes with PBS, they were incubated with blocking buffer (PBS with 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton-100) for 1 hr at RT. The sections were then incubated with Rabbit anti-TH (Millipore) in the same blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The following day, sections were washed three times with wash buffer (PBS with 0.3% Triton-100) before incubation with goat Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) for 1 hr at RT. Sections were then washed for three times with wash buffer before mounting in Fluoromount Aqueous Mounting Medium (Sigma). WGA-488 and tdTomato were visualized directly based on endogenous fluorescence. All the sections with tdTomato + cells were imaged at 20x using Olympus FV3000 confocal imaging system.
Adult Nav1.8 Cre/+ ; Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/+ animals (6-12 weeks) were given 1 μg of FITC-conjugated rat anti-CD169 antibody (BioRad) diluted in a total volume of 20 μL of PBS into the right footpad to label CD169 + subscapular macrophages inside the draining LN. Immediately after, the animals were prepared microsurgically for intravital two-photon microscopy as described before ( Mempel et al., 2004 87. Mempel, T.R. ∙ Henrickson, S.E. ∙ Von Andrian, U.H. T-cell priming by dendritic cells in lymph nodes occurs in three distinct phases Nature. 2004; 427 :154-159 Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, anesthesia during surgical preparation and imaging was achieved through the ketamine-xylazine method as described above. The right popLN was exposed and positioned with the cortex facing outward with minimal perturbation to afferent lymphatic vessels and surrounding blood vessels, while the animal was immobilized onto a custom-built stage by its hip bone and the vertebral column. The imaging chamber was created around the exposed LN with high vacuum grease (VWR) on the side and a coverslip on top. A thermocouple (Omega) was placed next to the LN to monitor the local temperature, which was maintained between 36.5 and 37°C by a custom-built water bath heating system. Two-photon imaging was performed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100MP Confocal/Multiphoton microscopy system with two MaiTai Ti:sapphire lasers (Spectra-Physics) tuned to 800 nm and 900 nm for two photon excitation and second harmonic generation. Z stacks of sensory innervation of the capsular/subcapsular space on the cortical side were acquired in 1 μm steps with a 20 ×, 0.95 numerical aperture objective (Olympus).
LPS (Sigma) and Pam3CSK4 (Invivogen) were dissolved in water to a stock concentration of 5mg/ml and 2mg/ml respectively. 50 μg of LPS or 40 μg of Pam3CSK4 were injected into one footpad of adult Nav1.8 Cre/+ x Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato mice in a total volume of 20 μl, while the contralateral footpad received equal volume of PBS. 3 days later, popLNs were harvested and processed for whole mount immunohistochemistry as described above.
Adult mice with retrogradely-labeled LN- or skin-innervating neurons were sacrificed by CO 2 asphyxiation. T13 and L1 DRGs ipsilateral to the side of injection were quickly removed without nerves attached and checked for tdTomato labeling in cold HBSS (1X, no Ca 2+ or Mg 2+ ) (VWR) under Leica MZ10 F stereomicroscope with fluorescence. DRGs were immediately digested with 1 mL of papain solution (HBSS/10 mM HEPES (VWR)/500 μM EDTA (Westnet)/0.4 mg/mL L-Cysteine (Sigma)/1.5 mM CaCl 2 (Sigma)/20 unit/mL Papain (Worthington)) in a 37°C water bath for 10 min, with agitation every 2 min. DRGs were further digested with 1 mL of collagenase type II/dispase solution (HBSS/10 mM HEPES/4 mg/mL collagenase type II (Worthington)/5 mg/mL dispase (Thermo Fisher)) in a 37°C water bath for 30 min, with agitation every 10 min. Following centrifugation at 400 g for 4 min, digested DRGs were mechanically disrupted in 0.2 mL of complete L15 medium (L15 (Invitrogen)/10 mM HEPES/10% FBS (Germini)) by passing them first through a 1000 μL pipette tip up to 10 times, and then through a 200 μL pipette tip up to 5 times until the tissues were fully dissociated. To remove myelin/axonal debris, the cell suspension diluted in 1 mL of complete L15 medium was carefully layered on top of 5 mL of Percoll gradient (L15/10 mM HEPES/20% Percoll (GE Healthcare) and centrifuged at 400 g for 9 min. After removing the supernatant, cells were washed in 2 mL of L15/10 mM HEPES and centrifuged at 750 g for 3 min. Finally, cells were resuspended in 1 mL of cold sorting buffer (L15/10 mM HEPES/1 mg/mL BSA (VWR)/25 μg/mL DNase I (Roche)), and subjected to fluorescence-assisted single-cell picking as described previously ( Hempel et al., 2007 50. Hempel, C.M. ∙ Sugino, K. ∙ Nelson, S.B. A manual method for the purification of fluorescently labeled neurons from the mammalian brain Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :2924-2929 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the cell suspension diluted in 3 mL of sorting buffer was immediately transferred to a 35 mm Petri dish (Scanning dish) with lane markings 6 mm apart and let sit on ice until most cells had settled to the bottom which normally takes 15-20 min. Rare fluorescent cells were readily identified under Leica MZ10 F stereomicroscope with fluorescence (transillumination off) by scanning the bottom of the dish lane by lane to maximize recovery and avoid rescanning. Zoom was set such that the field of view corresponded to the width of a single lane. To pick out fluorescent cells with minimal contamination from nonfluorescent cells, a pulled and trimmed micropipette (World Precision Instruments) was carefully lowered under transillumination into the sorting buffer until it was in the vicinity of the target cell. Simultaneous positive pressure was applied by mouth through the aspiration assembly system, as described above for retrograde labeling. Once the micropipette was in position, the target cell was gently aspirated into the micropipette through capillary action by transient release of positive pressure. The micropipette was quickly removed to prevent aspiration of unwanted cells or debris. The content of the micropipette, including the target cell, was expelled gently into a droplet of cold fresh sorting buffer on a different 35 mm Petri dish (wash dish 1) under transillumination. Wash dish 1 was kept on ice while subsequent scans for fluorescent cells occurred. Once 16 or all the fluorescent cells, whichever comes first, were collected in wash dish 1, cells were washed two additional times by moving them one by one into a new droplet of sorting buffer on clean 35 mm Petri dishes. Micropipettes were not reused for different cells to avoid cross contamination. After the final wash, each fluorescent cell was pipetted up and down the micropipette three times to remove unwanted contamination before being ejected into 10 μL of cold RLT (QIAGEN) supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) in a 96-well plate, and snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. The entire manual sorting procedure was routinely completed in 1.5 hr.
Single-cell libraries were generated according to the SMART-seq2 protocol ( Picelli et al., 2014 102. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, A.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (1091) PubMed Google Scholar ; Trombetta et al., 2014 127. Trombetta, J.J. ∙ Gennert, D. ∙ Lu, D. ... Preparation of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Libraries for Next Generation Sequencing Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2014; 107 :4.22.21-17 Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar ). Briefly, RNA from single-cell lysates was purified using AMPure RNA Clean Spri beads (Beckman Coulter) at a 2.2x volume ratio, and mixed with oligo-dT primer (SMART-seq2 3′ Oligo-dT Primer), dNTPs (NEB), and RNase inhibitor (Fisher Scientific) at 72°C for 3 minutes on a thermal cycler to anneal the 3′ primer to polyadenylated mRNA. Reverse transcription was carried out in a master mix of Maxima RNaseH-minus RT enzyme and buffer (Fisher Scientific), MgCl 2 (Sigma), Betaine (Sigma), RNase inhibitor, and a 5′ template switch oligonucleotide (SMART-seq2 5′ TSO) using the following protocol: 42°C for 90 minutes, followed by 10 cycles of 50°C for 2 minutes, 42°C for 2 minutes, and followed by inactivation at 70°C for 15 minutes. Whole transcriptome amplification was achieved by addition of KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems) and IS PCR primer (ISPCR) to the reverse transcription product and amplification on a thermal cycler using the following protocol: 98°C for 3 minutes, followed by 21 cycles of 98°C for 15 s, 67°C for 20 s, 72°C for 6 minutes, followed by a final 5-minute extension at 72°C. Libraries were purified using AMPure XP SPRI beads at a volume ratio of 0.8x followed by 0.9x. Library size was assessed using a High-Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Bioanalyzer), confirming the expected size distribution of ∼1000-2000 bp. Tagmentation reactions were carried out with the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) using 250 pg of cDNA per single cell as input, with modified manufacturer’s instructions as described. Libraries were purified twice with AMPure XP SPRI beads at a volume ratio of 0.9x, size distribution assessed using a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Bioanalyzer) and Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit (Invitrogen). Libraries were pooled and sequenced using NextSeq500/550 High Output v2 kits (75 cycles, Illumina) using 30-30 paired end sequencing with 8-mer dual indexing.
The RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Assay (ACD Biosystems) was performed according to RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 user manual for fresh-frozen tissue samples. Briefly, 14 μm fresh frozen sections from T13 and L1 DRGs with each side containing retrogradely-labeled tdTomato + LN- or skin- innervating neurons from the same animal were hybridized with RNAscope probes for Ptgir (487851), tdTomato (317041-C2), and Prokr2 (498431-C3) simultaneously. The probes were amplified and detected with TSA plus fluorescein, cyanine 3 and cyanine 5 (Perkin Elmer). The ACD 3-plex negative control probe was run in parallel on separate sections in each experiment to assess the background level and set the acquisition parameter. All sections with tdTomato + cells were imaged at 20x using an Olympus FV3000 confocal imaging system. The frequency of Ptgir + or Prokr2 + DRG neurons among the tdTomato + LN- or skin-innervating population was determined by considering all the tdTomato + cells that were recovered and uniquely-defined from a single animal.
Tamoxifen (Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma) at a concentration of 20 mg/mL by shaking overnight at 37°C, and stored at 4°C for the duration of the injections. For labeling arterial vessels with Bmx-CreER T2 , 0.5 mg of tamoxifen was delivered intraperitoneally to label arterial ECs into Bmx-CreER T2 ; Rosa26 eYFP/+ animals between 4-6 weeks of age daily for three consecutive days. Animals were analyzed between 1-3 weeks later.
For sympathetic denervation, the stock solution of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (Sigma) was prepared in water at 42 mg/mL and stored at −20°C. Nav1.8 Cre/+ ; Rosa26 LSL-tdTomato/+ animals from the same litter between the ages of 6-12 weeks were injected intraperitoneally with 6-OHDA (100 mg kg -1 ) or an equal volume of saline daily for 5 consecutive days. Animals were analyzed the following day.
Age-matched adult Nav1.8 Cre/+ ; Rosa26 LSL-ChR2-eYFP/+ (ChR2+) or Nav1.8 Cre/+ ; Rosa26 LSL-eYFP/+ (ChR2-) animals (6-12 weeks) were deeply anesthetized (isoflurane, 1.5%–2%, Patterson Vet) maintained at normal body temperature with a water bath heating system (Baxter) during surgical preparation and photostimulation. The animals were surgically prepared for intravital optogenetic stimulation using a method that was adapted from a previously-described protocol for intravital microcopy of iLNs ( von Andrian, 1996 135. von Andrian, U.H. Intravital microscopy of the peripheral lymph node microcirculation in mice Microcirculation. 1996; 3 :287-300 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the skin with the left iLN was flipped inside out following a small incision immediately left to the midline and glued onto a metal block to keep the medulla side of LN exposed. Care was taken not to overstretch the skin flap and damage lymphatic and blood vessels. The site of illumination, the branch point of the antero-posterior-running segment of the y-shaped superficial epigastric artery from where LN feeding arterioles emerged was located and exposed with microdissection without compromising the blood vessel integrity while the tissue was kept moist with normal saline. The stimulation chamber was then built around the iLN with vacuum grease on the side to keep solution from leaking, as well as a metal hairpin shaped tubing with hot water flowing inside on top of vacuum grease to maintain the tissue between 36.5 and 37°C. A thermocouple was placed next to the branch point to monitor the temperature at the tissue. An optic fiber (200 μm core, Thorlabs) coupled to a DPSS laser light source (473 nm, Shanghai Laser & Optics Century) was positioned for focal illumination directly on top of the branch point. The stimulation chamber was subsequently filled to the metal tubing with GenTeal Tears Lubricant Eye Gel (Alcon) to keep the tissue from drying out during stimulation. Pulsed light stimulation (5 ms pulses, 125 mW/mm 2 intensity, 20 Hz) was delivered to the targeted region for 3 hr under the control of a shutter system (Uniblitz). iLNs from both sides were immediately removed after light stimulation and kept in ice cold LN media (HBSS (Corning)/2% FBS/10 mM HEPES/2 mM CaCl 2 ) until subsequent processing.
LNs were kept on ice until processing, < 60 minutes between animal sacrifice and tissue digestion. To minimize biases introduced during tissue dissociation, a gentle dissociation protocol optimized for reliable isolation of both stromal and hemopoietic LN cells was used to generate a suspension of single cells from both the non-immune and the immune compartments ( Fletcher et al., 2011 42. Fletcher, A.L. ∙ Malhotra, D. ∙ Acton, S.E. ... Reproducible isolation of lymph node stromal cells reveals site-dependent differences in fibroblastic reticular cells Front. Immunol. 2011; 2 :35 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). LN media was aspirated, and each LN was placed in 1 mL of pre-warmed digestion media (0.8 mg/mL dispase, 0.2 mg/mL collagenase P (Roche), 50 μg/mL of DNase I in LN media). Using a pair of needle-nose forceps, the capsule of each LN was gently pierced, and the LN in digestion media were placed in a 37°C water bath for 20 minutes with no agitation. Next, LNs were gently agitated without touching the tissue, pelleted by gravity, and the 1 mL of digestion media supernatant was removed and placed in a collection tube on ice containing 10 mL of quenching buffer (PBS/5 mM EDTA/5% FBS). A fresh 1 mL of digestion buffer was added to each LN, and the LNs were placed back in the 37°C water bath for an additional 5 minutes. The LN was gently agitated and triturated using a 1000 μL pipette tip, solid capsular and stromal matter was allowed to settle to the bottom of the tube without centrifuging, and the supernatant digestion media was added to the same collection tube containing quenching buffer. 5-minute incubation periods in fresh digestion buffer and trituration with a 1000 μL pipette tip continued until LNs were completely digested, typically requiring 3-4 additional digestion steps. The cellular suspension in quenching buffer was filtered through a 100 μm filter, and washed with an additional 15 mL of quenching buffer. Single-cell suspensions were centrifuged at 300 g for 3 minutes at 4°C, and counted using a hemocytometer and light microscope. We recovered an average of 4.00 ± 0.53 million cells per LN, and observed no differences in cellularity by treatment group or animal genotype. We saved an aliquot of 60,000 cells from each sample in quenching media on ice as the unenriched sample, and centrifuged the remaining cells at 300 g for 3 minutes at 4°C. Next, using the Miltenyi CD3ε microbead kit and CD19 mouse microbead kit, all remaining LN cells were stained according to manufacturer instructions with the following modifications. First, single cells were stained with CD3ε biotin for 10 minutes on ice, washed once with MACS buffer (PBS/0.5% BSA (Sigma)/2 mM EDTA) and stained simultaneously with CD19 microbeads and biotin microbeads. Cells were isolated using LD columns (Miltenyi) according to manufacturer specifications and the flow-through was collected as the non-T and non-B enriched sample. Single cells from both enriched and unenriched samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 3 minutes at 4°C, and counted using a hemocytometer with trypan blue staining to estimate cell viability. Across 14 LNs, we recovered an average of 270,000 ± 31,000 (mean ± SEM) cells per lymph node following CD3ε and CD19 depletion with > 90% viability.
For LN cellularity analysis, single-cell suspensions of the two iLNs from the same ChR2+ or ChR2- mouse (6-12 weeks) were prepared as above. The cells were then filtered through steel mesh and resuspended at the appropriate cell density in FACS buffer before being acquired on a BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Single cells from each lymph node prior to and post CD3ε and CD19 depletion were kept separate and diluted to 15,000 cells in 200 μL complete media (RPMI 1640/10% FBS). Seq-Well was performed as described with changes noted below ( Aicher et al., 2019 3. Aicher, T.P. ∙ Carroll, S. ∙ Raddi, G. ... Seq-Well: A Sample-Efficient, Portable Picowell Platform for Massively Parallel Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1979 :111-132 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gierahn et al., 2017 45. Gierahn, T.M. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Hughes, T.K. ... Seq-Well: portable, low-cost RNA sequencing of single cells at high throughput Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :395-398 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a pre-functionalized PDMS array containing ∼86,000 nanowells was loaded with uniquely-barcoded mRNA capture beads (ChemGenes) ( Macosko et al., 2015 80. Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Basu, A. ∙ Satija, R. ... Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets Cell. 2015; 161 :1202-1214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2270) PubMed Google Scholar ) and suspended in complete media for at least 20 minutes. 15,000 cells were deposited onto the top of each PDMS array and let settle by gravity into distinct wells. The array was gently washed with PBS, and sealed using a functionalized polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 0.01 μm, which allows exchange of buffers without permitting mixing of cell materials between different wells. Seq-Well arrays were sealed in a dry 37°C oven for 40 minutes, and submerged in a lysis buffer containing 5 M guanidium thiocyanate (Sigma), 1 mM EDTA, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 0.05% sarkosyl (Sigma) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Arrays were transferred to hybridization buffer containing 2 M NaCl (Fisher Scientific) with 8% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, Sigma) and agitated for 40 minutes at room temperature, mRNA capture beads with mRNA hybridized were collected from each Seq-Well array, and beads were resuspended in a master mix for reverse transcription containing Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase and buffer, dNTPs, RNase inhibitor, a 5′ template switch oligonucleotide (Seq-Well 5′ TSO), and PEG for 30 minutes at room temperature, and overnight at 52°C with end-over-end rotation. Exonuclease digestion was carried out as described previously: beads were washed with TE with 0.01% tween-20 (Fisher Scientific) and TE with 0.5% SDS (Sigma), denatured while rotating for 5 minutes in 0.2 mM NaOH, and resuspended in ExoI (NEB) for 1 hour at 37°C with end-over-end rotation ( Hughes et al., 2019 56. Hughes, T.K. ∙ Wadsworth, M.H. ∙ Gierahn, T.M. ... Highly Efficient, Massively-Parallel Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Cellular States and Molecular Features of Human Skin Pathology bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Next, beads were washed with TE + 0.01% tween-20, and second strand synthesis was carried out by resuspending beads in a master mix containing Klenow Fragment (NEB), dNTPs, PEG, and the dN-SMRT oligonucleotide (Seq-Well Second Strand Primer) to enable random priming off of the beads. PCR was carried out as described using 2X KAPA HiFi Hotstart Readymix and ISPCR primer (Seq-Well ISPCR), and placed on a thermal cycler using the following protocol: 95°C for 3 minutes, followed by 4 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 65°C for 45 s, 72°C for 3 minutes, followed by 12 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 67°C for 20 s, 72°C for 3 minutes, followed by a final 5-minute extension at 72°C. Post-whole transcriptome amplification proceeded as described above for SMART-seq2 libraries, with the following exceptions: AMPure XP SPRI bead cleanup occurred first at a 0.6 x volume ratio, followed by 0.8x. Library size was analyzed using an Agilent Tapestation hsD5000 kit, confirming the expected peak at ∼1000 bp, and absence of smaller peaks corresponding to primer. Libraries were quantified using Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit and prepared for Illumina sequencing using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit using 900 pg of cDNA library as input to tagmentation reactions. Amplified final libraries were purified twice with AMPure XP SPRI beads as before, with a volume ratio of 0.6x followed by 0.8x. Libraries from 3 Seq-Well arrays were pooled and sequenced together using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kit (75 cycles) using a paired end read structure with custom read 1 primer (Seq-Well CR1P): read 1: 20 bases, read 2: 50 bases, read 1 index: 8 bases.
All image analyses were performed in Imaris 9.2.1 or 7.4.2 as detailed below. To better visualize neuronal architecture in or/and around LNs, for all LN images except for Figures 7 K, 7L, S1 B, S2 D, S2 E, S3 A, S3 D, and S7 A, an isosurface for the LN was generated by manually drawing LN contours on 2D slices every fifth slice and was used to mask the original images so that only what was inside the LN mask was shown. Depending on the purpose of the experiment, LN isosurfaces were defined with varying degrees of stringency: based on the outermost layer of LECs in Figures 2 A and 2C and S2 A, on collagen type I staining in Figure 2 F, on SMA staining in Figures 2 D, 2E and S2 B, or on GFP background staining in Figure S1 A or on tdTomato background staining everywhere else. In Figures 2 A, 2C–2F, S2 A, S2B, and S3 H, additional masking of the channel(s) where nerves were stained was performed with isosurfaces generated for neuronal signal within LNs based on morphology, i.e., fiber-like structures that can be traced through multiple slices, to highlight neuronal structures. To better visualize fibers in the capsular/subcapsular space of LNs as shown in Figure 2 F, intranodal sensory fibers and total sensory fibers within and below the capsule were isolated by masking the original channel with LN isosurfaces defined based on GFP (LECs) and collagen type I staining, respectively. The resulting channel after subtracting the former channel from the latter one corresponds to the capsular/subcapsular plexus. Original, processed images and rendered isosurfaces were viewed as 3D reconstructions in surpass view with orthogonal camera setting unless indicated otherwise.
For quantification of innervation density of LNs as in Figures 1 C–1F, relevant channels were first masked with the LN isosurface as described above. Isosurfaces for sensory and sympathetic fibers within the masked channels, i.e., inside the LN, were then generated by automatic creation based on features that distinguish neuronal signal from everything else, e.g., intensity, sphericity, followed by manual editing. Sensory or sympathetic fiber density for a given LN was defined as the ratio of the volume of isosurfaces for sensory or sympathetic fibers within the LN to that for the LN. Similar steps were taken to generate isosurfaces for sensory fibers inside the LNs for 3D rendering and quantification in Figures 5 G–5N.
For quantification of penetration depth of intranodal sensory fibers, the outermost layer of LECs, which demarcates the LN boundary, was used to precisely segment LNs into isosurfaces. Isosurfaces for intranodal sensory fibers, sensory fibers within the relevant channel after applying the LN isosurface as a mask, were generated as described above. Using the distance transformation function, the closest distance from any given voxel within the LN isosurface to the surface of the LN in μm was computed and converted into an intensity value for that given voxel in a separate channel. To determine penetration depth of intranodal sensory fibers, the distance transformation channel was masked against isosurfaces for intranodal sensory fibers to generate a new channel where the penetration depth at any given voxel within the intranodal sensory fibers was encoded as the intensity value for that specific voxel with the maximum intensity value representing the maximum penetration depth for a given LN. Such a channel, when displayed in surpass view as in Figure 2 A, allowed direct visualization of the spatial relationship between intranodal sensory fibers and the nearest LN surface. Additionally, the penetration depth of intranodal sensory fibers was described in Figure 2 B in the form of the percentage of total intranodal fibers found within LN spaces with increasing distance away from the LN surface. For that analysis, the original distance transformation channel, as described above, was used to create a series of isosurfaces of decreasing sizes which represent increasingly-deep LN spaces with its closest distance to the LN surface increasing from 0 to 100 μm with 10 μm intervals. For example, 10 was set as the intensity threshold cutoff during automatic creation so that all voxels with intensity value larger than and equal to 10 were selected in one single surface which corresponds to the LN space 10 μm and more below the LN surface. To calculate the percentage of total intranodal sensory fibers in any of those LN spaces, the isosurface for total sensory fibers and that for a said LN space, e.g., 10 μm and more below the surface, as described above, were each used to generate their corresponding binary channels, where all voxels outside of a surface were set as 0, while those inside were set at 100. Colocalization analysis was then performed on those two binary channels, and the percentage of non 0 voxels in the binary nerve channel that were colocalized corresponded to the percentage of total intranodal sensory fibers found 10 μm and more below the LN surface. This process was repeated for increasingly smaller LN spaces with 10 μm interval. The percentage of total intranodal fibers in LN spaces in the form of 10um bins from 0 to 100 μm, e.g., 10-20 μm, was further derived from serial subtraction of the percentage in the LN space that is 10um deeper, e.g., (20 μm and more below the surface), from that in the current LN space, e.g., (10 μm and more below the surface), as shown in Figure 2 B.
Single cells were sequenced to a depth of 1.6 ± 0.1 million (mean ± SEM) reads per cell. Pooled libraries were demultiplexed using bcl2fastq (v2.17.1.14) with default settings, and aligned using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 32. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (9723) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the mouse UCSC genome reference (version mm10), and a gene expression matrix was generated using RSEM (v1.2.3) in paired-end mode. Single-cell libraries with fewer than 3,000 unique genes and fewer than 17% of reads mapping to transcriptomic regions were excluded from subsequent analysis, resulting in a final dataset of 52 LN-innervating neurons collected from 8 mice, and 31 skin-innervating neurons collected from 4 mice. Among cells retained for analysis, the number of unique genes captured was 9,843 ± 229 (mean ± SEM) among LN-innervating neurons and 9,653 ± 302 among skin-innervating neurons. Libraries from LN-innervating neurons contained 50.45 ± 2.3% transcriptome-aligning fragments, libraries from skin-innervating neurons contained 58.33 ± 2.9%. Among all alignment and library quality metrics assessed, we found no significant differences between LN-innervating and skin-innervating neurons. All analysis of gene expression was completed using the normalized RSEM output as transcripts per million (TPM).
All analyses of scRNA-seq data was carried out using the R language for Statistical Computing. Single-cell libraries were first assessed for expression of canonical neuronal markers and known lineage-defining genes from accompanying imaging data, such as Nav1.8 ( Scn10a ) and tyrosine hydroxylase ( Th ). The full list of markers is supplied in Table S1 . To directly assess differences in gene expression between LN-innervating and skin-innervating neurons, we used the R package Single Cell Differential Expression (SCDE, version 1.99.1) with default input parameters ( Fan et al., 2016 38. Fan, J. ∙ Salathia, N. ∙ Liu, R. ... Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :241-244 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kharchenko et al., 2014 65. Kharchenko, P.V. ∙ Silberstein, L. ∙ Scadden, D.T. Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :740-742 Crossref Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ). A cutoff of Holm-corrected Z score > 1.96 or < −1.96 (corresponding to a corrected p value < 0.05) was used to identify significantly DE genes for subsequent analysis. Heatmaps were created using the R package gplots (version 3.0.1). DAVID was used for analysis of over-represented gene ontologies over significantly DE genes ( Huang et al., 2009a 54. Huang, W. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Lempicki, R.A. Bioinformatics enrichment tools: paths toward the comprehensive functional analysis of large gene lists Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :1-13 Crossref Scopus (7974) PubMed Google Scholar , 2009b 55.

Protoc. 2009; 4 :44-57 Crossref Scopus (20181) PubMed Google Scholar ).
As our target-specific single cells do not represent the full diversity of neurons contained in the DRG, we utilized the scRNA-seq atlas published by Usoskin et al. (2015) 130. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar (subsequently referred to as the “Usoskin, Furlan Atlas” to classify our cells. Using the raw data and accompanying metadata hosted at http://linnarssonlab.org/drg/ , we first identified the intersection of expressed genes from the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas and LN-innervating and skin-innervating single cells, and eliminated cells identified as non-neuronal (“NoN” and “NoN outlier”) from the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas, resulting in a dataset of 148 neurofilamentous (NF), 81 peptidergic (PEP), 251 tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 169 non-peptidergic (NP), and 39 “Central, unsolved” cells. To mimic the dimensionality reduction methods the previous authors used to identify major neuronal cell types, we transformed the data as log 2 (1+TPM), and calculated the gene variance across all cells. We cut to genes with a variance log 2 (1+TPM) > 0.5, resulting in 11,778 genes. Next, we performed principal component analysis over the log 2 -transformed, mean-centered data, and found that PC 2 and PC 4 reflected major axes of variability between TH, PEP, NF, and NP cell types – identified by the authors of the previous study as “Level.1” cell type subsets ( Figure S4 A). To identify how LN-innervating and skin-innervating cells related to major DRG cell types in a reduced dimensional space, we projected our target-specific data into PC 2 and PC 4 of the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas. This was completed by first calculating the principal components: 𝐗 − 𝒄 𝑚 = 𝐔 ⁢ 𝐒 ⁢ 𝐕 T (Equation 1) where X is the log 2 (1+TPM) data matrix of M genes by N cells from the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas. Equation 1 calculates the singular value decomposition of this matrix after subtracting the average of each row (gene) of X, denoted c m , from X. U represents a matrix of M orthonormal vectors corresponding to M genes and V represents a matrix of N orthonormal vectors corresponding to N cells. To apply this same dimensionality reduction transformation to our new dataset of LN-innervating and skin-innervating single cells, Y, we use Equation 2: 𝐏 ⁢ 𝐂 i = ∑ M m = 1 ( 𝐘 − 𝒄 𝑚 ) ⁢ 𝐮 i (Equation 2) Y represents the log 2 (1+TPM) transformed matrix of our innervation-target-specific data, c m refers to the same vector of row (gene) averages calculated from X. The centered Y matrix is multiplied as a dot product with the i th principal component gene eigenvector, or the i th column vector of U, denoted u i . By taking the sum over all transformed rows for each column (cell), we project the LN-innervating and skin-innervating data (Y) into the principal component space calculated for the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas (X), denoted PC i . This data is visualized by plotting the PC 2 and PC 4 vectors from the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas (transparent circles, Figure S4 A), with the PC 2 and PC 4 vectors from the transformed LN-innervating and skin-innervating cells (filled squares). The Euclidean distance between each innervation-target-specific single cell and all cells within the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas was calculated over PC2 and PC4 ( Figure S4 B). The range of cell-to-cell Euclidean distances between like-cells (e.g., PEP-to-PEP) within the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas is represented by a dashed line corresponding to the 99%ile.
We similarly analyzed our LN-innervating and skin-innervating single cell transcriptomes in the context of an expanded dataset of somatosensory neurons published by Sharma et al. (2020) 115. Sharma, N. ∙ Flaherty, K. ∙ Lezgiyeva, K. ... The emergence of transcriptional identity in somatosensory neurons Nature. 2020; 577 :392-398 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar (subsequently referred to as the “Sharma Atlas”). Here, authors generated data from 10,922 cells from cervical, thoracic, and lumbar dorsal root ganglia, uncovering at least 15 transcriptionally distinct cell types/states. Unlike the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas, the cell types in the Sharma Atlas could not be sufficiently represented in two-dimensional principal components space. Using the JackStraw method from the Seurat package to identify significant principal components, we recovered 32 significant principal components. As with the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas, we next projected the LN-innervating and skin-innervating single cell transcriptomes into the 32-dimensional principal components space defined by the Sharma Atlas according to Equation 2 , and created a joint principal component matrix of cells x PC 1-32 including cells from the Sharma Atlas, LN-innervating neurons, and skin-innervating neurons. Finally, we constructed a shared nearest-neighbor graph over this joint matrix and visualized single cells in a two-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot ( Figures 4 A and 4B). To establish cell similarity, we used label propagation methods over a shared nearest-neighbor graph built from the 32-dimensional projected space, similar to other published methods for single-cell transcriptomic integration ( Barkas et al., 2019 10. Barkas, N. ∙ Petukhov, V. ∙ Nikolaeva, D. ... Joint analysis of heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq dataset collections Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :695-698 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stuart et al., 2019 121. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (784) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, “unknown” cells (from the LN-innervating or skin-innervating datasets) were each queried for their top 100 nearest neighbors, and cellular identity was predicted based on a consensus identity of the cell’s neighbors. Results from label propagation are presented in Figure 4 C.
To analyze the expression similarity between each single cell from our target-specific dataset and the data in the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas and Sharma Atlas in a more directed, supervised manner, we assessed how each single cell correlated with each neuron subtype defined by each Atlas. For the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas, we elected to use the more detailed neuronal subtypes, termed “Level.3,” which breaks some of the major neuron subtypes, NP, PEP, and NF, into subtypes based on intra-population diversity. For both Atlases, we calculated the average gene expression for each neuron subtype (e.g., NP1) over the log 2 (1+TPM) transformed single-cell data, generating pseudo-population averages for each neuron subtype. Next, we only considered genes in our pseudo-population averages that were designated as “subtype-defining” by the Usoskin et al. (2015) 130. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar analysis, corresponding to the top 50 genes upregulated within each cell type when compared to all other cell types in their dataset, yielding 379 unique genes. For the Sharma Atlas, we restricted genes to the 700 genes defined by the authors as “subtype specific” and provided as supplemental data 1 in their manuscript. We similarly restricted our LN-innervating and skin-innervating single-cell libraries to only these 379 unique genes (for comparison to the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas) or 700 unique genes (for comparison to the Sharma Atlas), and calculated the Spearman correlation between each target-specific single cell (following log 2 (1+TPM) transformation) and the pseudo-population averages. The results from this analysis are presented in Figure 4 D for comparison to the Sharma Atlas, and Figure S4 C for comparison to the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas. We clustered LN-innervating and skin-innervating single cells by their correlation with the Usoskin, Furlan Atlas pseudo-population using complete linkage clustering, and using a cut height of 0.8 retained 4 distinct Neuron Types: Neuron type 1 (LN-innervating cells: 25, skin-innervating cells: 9), Neuron type 2 (LN-innervating cells: 1, skin-innervating cells: 14), Neuron type 3 (LN-innervating cells: 23, skin-innervating cells: 5), and Neuron type 4 (LN-innervating cells: 3, skin-innervating cells: 3) ( Figure S4 C). We confirmed these clusters were largely stable and in agreement with the partitions created in comparison with the Sharma Atlas ( Figure 4 D). Neuron Types 1 and 3, which share the strongest similarity with CGRP-η, -ξ, -α, -β -γ, and -ε subtypes defined by Sharma et al. (2020) 115. Sharma, N. ∙ Flaherty, K. ∙ Lezgiyeva, K. ...

(2015) 130. Usoskin, D. ∙ Furlan, A. ∙ Islam, S. ... Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :145-153 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar , were enriched in the LN-innervating population relative to the skin-innervating population (LN-innervating: 48% Neuron Type 1, 44% Neuron Type 3; skin-innervating: 29% Neuron Type 1, 16% Neuron Type 3). Conversely, Neuron Types 2 and 4 were underrepresented in the LN-innervating population compared to the skin-innervating population (LN-innervating: 2% Neuron Type 2, 6% Neuron Type 4; skin-innervating: 45% Neuron Type 2, 10% Neuron Type 4).
To assess the gene expression phenotype of each Neuron Type, we used SCDE to identify DE genes between cells of each Neuron Type compared to all cells of the 3 remaining Neuron Types. SCDE was run as described above with default input parameters, genes with a Holm-corrected p value < 0.01 were considered significant and presented in Figure 4 F and Table S1 .
Reads were aligned and processed according to the Drop-Seq Computational Protocol v2.0 ( https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq ). Briefly, reads were first demultiplexed according to index read 1 using bcl2fastq (v2.17.1.14) with default settings. Read 1 was split into the first 12 base pairs corresponding to the cell barcode (CB), and the 13-20 th base pairs, which encode the unique molecular identifier (UMI). CBs, UMIs, and read 2 sequences with low base quality were discarded, as were any that contained non-random sequences (e.g., primer sequences, poly-A tails). Following CB and UMI tagging, read 2 was aligned to the mouse genome (version mm10) using STAR v2.5.2b with default parameters including “–limitOutSJcollapsed 1000000–twopassMode Basic.” STAR alignments were merged to recover cell and molecular barcodes, and any sequences within hamming edit distance 1 were merged, as these likely originated from the same original sequence. Additional methods to correct for bead synthesis errors in the CB or UMI are detailed in the Drop-Seq Computational Protocol v2.0 (“DetectBeadSynthesisErrors” function). Digital gene expression matrices for each array were retained following quality filtering and UMI-correction, and further processed using the R language for Statistical Computing. Cells with fewer than 300 unique genes were removed from analysis.
We restricted our primary analysis of LN-resident cell types to only arrays corresponding to steady state iLN without surgical manipulation or optogenetic stimulation. A total of 9,662 cells were retained with 25,929 unique genes expressed across 7 mice with 1 LN per mouse. For 2 mice, we sequenced arrays corresponding to all LN cells prior to CD3ε/CD19 depletion as well as CD3ε/CD19 depleted cells on a separate array. The average cell recovery per array was 1,074 ± 141 (mean ± SEM) cells, with an average gene count of 1,581 ± 11 genes and average UMI per cell of 4,251 ± 48 UMI (mean ± SEM). Data was normalized and scaled using the Seurat R package ( https://github.com/satija.lab/seurat ; Butler et al., 2018 18. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (1532) PubMed Google Scholar ): transforming the data to log e (UMI+1) and applying a scale factor of 10,000. We confirmed equivalent depth and cell quality across each of our arrays and the absence of major batch effects introduced by sequencing work-up day or other technical factors, and thus did not regress any batch-related covariates out of our data, including individual cell quality or mitochondrial percent. To identify major axes of variation within our data, we first subsetted our data to only highly-variable genes across all cells – all genes with dispersion (calculated as the variance to mean ratio) > 1.1 were kept, resulting in 2,348 variable genes. Principal component analysis was applied to the cells cut to variable genes for the top 100 principal components. Using the JackStraw function within Seurat, we identified the top significant PCs, and compared these significant PCs to the variance explained by each dimension, ultimately choosing 41 PCs for subsequent clustering and further dimensionality reduction ( Shekhar et al., 2016 116. Shekhar, K. ∙ Lapan, S.W. ∙ Whitney, I.E. ... Comprehensive Classification of Retinal Bipolar Neurons by Single-Cell Transcriptomics Cell. 2016; 166 :1308-1323.e30 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (395) PubMed Google Scholar ). Critically, we completed all of the following analysis over a range of variable gene cutoffs and principal components to ensure that our cell identification results were robust to parameter choice.
For 2D visualization, we used the Barnes-Hut implementation of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) with “perplexity” set to 40. This tSNE projection of the steady state LN atlas is represented in Figures 6 B and S5 A. To identify clusters of transcriptionally-similar cells, we employed unsupervised clustering with the Louvain algorithm with the Jaccard correction ( Blondel et al., 2008 15. Blondel, V.D. ∙ Guillaume, J. ∙ Lambiotte, R. ... Fast unfolding of communities in large networks J. Stat. Mech. 2008; 2008 :P10008 Crossref Scopus (7613) Google Scholar ). Briefly, this method involves constructing a k-nearest neighbor graph over the Euclidean distance between cells in the 41-PC reduced space, followed by a shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-based clustering and modularity optimization ( Waltman and Van Eck, 2013 138. Waltman, L. ∙ Van Eck, N.J. A smart local moving algorithm for large-scale modularity-based community detection Eur. Phys. J. B. 2013; 86 :471 Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar ). We implemented this using the FindClusters tool within the Seurat R package with default parameters and k.param set to 20 and resolution set to 0.4. Here, we intentionally underclustered our data to avoid erroneously splitting cells with shared cell type functions, as the variable genes calculated for this dimensionally-reduced space likely did not fully reflect more nuanced cell type differences (e.g., variable behavior between Neutrophil subtypes). The “Parent Cluster” results from first-pass cell type clustering are represented in the tSNE plot and clusters identified in Figure S5 A. We used the Seurat function FindAllMarkers to identify differentially-expressed genes upregulated within each cluster compared to all other cells in the dataset, and tested differential expression using the likelihood-ratio test for single-cell gene expression (by setting test.use to “bimod”) ( McDavid et al., 2013 84. McDavid, A. ∙ Finak, G. ∙ Chattopadyay, P.K. ... Data exploration, quality control and testing in single-cell qPCR-based gene expression experiments Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :461-467 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ). The top 100 differentially-expressed genes for each cluster were analyzed, as ranked by the average fold change and restricted to only those with FDR-corrected p values < 0.05. Next, to assess if any cell subtypes existed within each cluster, we restricted our data to only cells within a single “Parent Cluster,” and recalculated the variable genes over these cells. The above analysis, from calculation of variable genes to tSNE visualization and cluster identification, was repeated for each cluster listed in Figure S5 A. Cell types for which we could identify sub-clusters with significant differentially-expressed genes are marked with asterisks next to their names in Figure S5 A, and the sub-cluster tSNE projections and top differentially expressed genes are represented in Figures S5 B–S5O. For the T cell parent cluster, we required two iterative sub-clustering steps to fully enumerate all constituent cell types: the first clustering step differentiated regulatory T cells (Tregs) from the remaining T cells ( Figures S5 B and S5C), and subsequent clustering on the non-Treg T cells uncovered CD4 T cells versus CD8 T cells. All differentially-expressed genes within each sub-cluster can be found in Table S2 .
After exhaustive assessment for cell subclusters within each cell type, we identified 24 unique cell types within our steady state dataset ( Figure 6 B). We calculated the differentially expressed genes between each cell type and all other cells using a likelihood ratio test (using the FindAllMarkers function with test.use set to “bimod”), the results of this analysis are presented in Figures 6 C and S5 P and Table S2 . By identifying canonical marker genes within these DE gene lists from the literature and using resources such as ImmGen ( Heng et al., 2008 51. Heng, T.S. ∙ Painter, M.W., Immunological Genome Project Consortium The Immunological Genome Project: networks of gene expression in immune cells Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :1091-1094 Crossref Scopus (822) PubMed Google Scholar ), we attributed cell identities to each cell type within our dataset, as named in Figures 6 B, 6C, and S5 P. We recovered two populations of blood endothelial cells, one of which likely corresponds to HEV endothelial cells (HEC), based on uniform and high expression of well-established HEC markers, e.g., Ccl21a , Fut7 , Chst4 ( Figures S5 H and S5I; Homeister et al., 2001 52.

Immunol. 2005; 6 :1105-1113 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). The second blood endothelial cell cluster, termed BEC, includes a heterogeneous set of non-HEV endothelial cells, including arterial, capillary, and non-HEV venular cells ( Figures S5 H and S5I; Vanlandewijck et al., 2018 132.

Additionally, we identified two distinct populations of Prox1 + lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), with LEC 1 likely representing a mixture of LECs lining the floor of SCS and medullary sinuses based on Madcam1, Msr1, Bmp2, Vcam1, and CD274 (PD-L1) expression profiles ( Cohen et al., 2014 26.

Interestingly, cells within the LEC 2 cluster shared molecular signatures with LECs positioned at the ceiling of SCS, within the cortical sinuses, and lining lymphatic vessels, including selective expression of Emcn , Ackr4 , Ackr2 , Klf2 , Fabp4 and Cav1 ( Iftakhar-E-Khuda et al., 2016 58.

Immunol. 2014; 15 :623-630 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also identified a subtype of dendritic-cell-like cells (Aire + APC), which likely represent the Aire-expressing ILC3-like cells that were described recently ( Yamano et al., 2019 145. Yamano, T. ∙ Dobeš, J. ∙ Vobořil, M. ... Aire-expressing ILC3-like cells in the lymph node display potent APC features J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :1027-1037 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, we detected two subtypes of neutrophils, Neutrophils 1 and 2, which potentially reflect distinct maturation states similar to what was recently described for bone marrow neutrophils ( Evrard et al., 2018 37. Evrard, M. ∙ Kwok, I.W.H. ∙ Chong, S.Z. ...

We reasoned that cells or cell types within the LN that interact with innervating neurons would likely express proteins that enable such contact or communication. As we generated unbiased single-cell transcriptomic data from LN-innervating neurons and the potential targeted cell types, we incorporated databases of ligand and receptor pairs to understand if any of the LN-resident cell types expressed a high abundance of cognate molecules, and would thus be poised to interact with innervating neurons. A general schematic of this method is provided in Figure S6 A. We used the database of receptor-ligand interactions curated by Ramilowski et al. ( Ramilowski et al., 2015 107. Ramilowski, J.A. ∙ Goldberg, T. ∙ Harshbarger, J. ... A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signalling in human Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7866 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ), which consists of 2,422 total interactions over 708 unique genes (originally provided as human genes, and converted to mouse orthologs using the HUGO database). First, data from LN-innervating neurons was limited to only genes with non-negligible expression, using a cutoff of average log 2 (1+TPM) > 3, yielding 6,666 total genes for subsequent analysis. The intersection of genes within the Ramilowski interaction database and those expressed at non-negligible levels among LN-innervating neurons yielded 184 total genes. After limiting to only interactions with at least one participating gene expressed in the LN-innervating neurons, the interaction database was restricted to 750 total receptor-ligand pairs, and 471 unique potential cognates. We next assessed the expression of these 471 cognate genes within the LN-resident cell atlas. First, we summarized the expression of individual cells within the LN-resident atlas by taking the pseudo-population average of each cell type (over non-log single-cell data). We limited the LN-resident atlas data to only genes with non-negligible expression across all cell type pseudo-populations, cutting to genes with an average UMI expression > 1, yielding 256 total potential cognates (from the previous 471). Next, we developed a summary statistic to reflect the abundance of neuron cognates expressed within LN-resident cell types. First, we scaled our data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each individual gene – this enabled us to assess the contribution of all genes equally such that signal was not dominated by genes with high total expression ( Figure 6 E). Finally, we calculated the “Interaction Potential” (IP) as the mean of these scaled values for each cell type: cell types that expressed relatively higher abundances of all candidate neuron-cognates received a higher IP score. Our null model states that the interaction potentials we calculated are no more extreme than the IP we would have recovered by chance. To test our experimentally-derived IP, we generated a null distribution by shuffling the cell type labels over all single cells within the LN-resident cell atlas, and repeated the “cell type” averaging, scaling, and IP calculation for 1,000 permutations. By comparing our true IP scores to the null distribution, we were able to identify certain cell types with significantly higher IP than observed by chance, and could attribute a P value to each cell type ( Figure 6 F, 99% confidence interval denoted by dashed line). IP scores were re-scaled such that the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval was equal to 0 for clarity. The results of this approach are presented in Figures 6 D–6F, S6 A, and S6B.
Crucially, we were concerned that the method of calculation of the IP, the summary statistics applied, the choice of raw versus scaled data, or confounding factors that differentiate cell types, including average genes/cell and number of cells per cell type, would influence our ranked list of top interacting cell types and bias our results. For example, we wondered whether differences in quality metrics or other technical factors between cell types might result in higher or lower IP rankings – for instance, a cell type with significantly higher RNA recovery per cell than another cell type would appear to have a higher interaction potential. We found no correlation between the IP (as reported in Figure 6 F) and the median UMI per cell for each cell type ( Figure S6 B , p = 0.32). To address bias introduced by our choice in summary statistic or data normalization, we repeated the above pipeline without gene-wise scaling across cell types ( Figure S6 C), or by calculating the percent of cells with non-zero expression of a given gene, in the place of calculating of average expression per cell type ( Figure S6 D). In both of these cases, we observed that non-endothelial stroma, LEC 1, LEC 2, BEC, and HEC remained the top-scoring cell types for Interaction Potential (significance calculated by permutation test as described above). Finally, we reasoned that variations in the number of cells per cell type might limit our ability to compare between different cell types. We iteratively down-sampled our single-cell data to analyze interaction potentials (using the method in Figures 6 D–6F) for only 25 total cells per cell type – the histograms of these calculations after 1,000 iterations are plotted in Figure S6 E. Critically, non-endothelial stroma, LEC 1, LEC 2, BEC, and HEC cell types remained top-ranking in Interaction Potential after controlling for cell abundance per cell type.
Finally, we derived an alternative statistical testing strategy to assess the overrepresentation of neuron-interaction cognates among expressed genes between different cell types. Here, we binarized our data to classify genes as “expressed” or “not expressed” within a cell type, using an average gene expression cutoff of 1. We considered the list of 256 potential neuronal cognate genes, and used a Fisher’s Exact Test to assess whether the cognate gene list was overrepresented among expressed genes for a given cell type (mimicking the field-standard for gene ontology enrichment analysis) ( Huang et al., 2009a 54. Huang, W. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Lempicki, R.A. Bioinformatics enrichment tools: paths toward the comprehensive functional analysis of large gene lists Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :1-13 Crossref Scopus (7974) PubMed Google Scholar , 2009b 55. Huang, W. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Lempicki, R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :44-57 Crossref Scopus (20181) PubMed Google Scholar ), and a Holm correction to adjust for multiple tests. In close agreement with the results from our interaction potential statistic above, we found significant overrepresentation of potential neuronal cognate genes in the following cell types (listed in decreasing statistical significance): non-endothelial stroma (p = 1.6 × 10 −28 ), BEC (p = 2.5 × 10 −22 ), LEC 1 (p = 4.5 × 10 −22 ), HEC (p = 8.3 × 10 −21 ), LEC 2 (p = 9.6 × 10 −20 ), Macrophages (p = 8.7 × 10 −9 ), Mast Cells (p = 6.5 × 10 −8 ), Neutrophils 2 (p = 5.2 × 10 −6 ), Neutrophils 1 (p = 1.8 × 10 −4 ), pDC (p = 1.7 × 10 −3 ), Aire + APCs (p = 3.4 × 10 −3 ), and cDC2 (8.9 × 10 −3 ). All other cell types were non-significant by a Holm-adjusted p value cutoff of 0.01. Critically, this ranking was not sensitive to the choice of binarization cutoff, tested over a range of 0.5 – 10 UMI, data not shown).
Cells were partitioned into the cell types annotated in Figure 7 B. Using the Seurat function DiffExpTest, which employs a likelihood ratio test to identify differentially expressed genes, we analyzed cells for each cell type from ChR2+Light+ LN versus ChR2+Light- LN. Similarly, we identified differentially expressed genes by cell type between ChR2-Light+ LN versus Chr2-Light- LN. We reasoned that the DE genes in ChR2+ mice represented both the effects of neuronal stimulation, as well as changes induced by surgery and/or phototoxicity, while the DE genes in the ChR2- mice only correspond to changes due to surgery and/or phototoxicity. For each cell type, we identified genes DE in ChR2+ animals by a Holm-adjusted p value cutoff of 0.05, and eliminated genes from these lists that were also DE (using the same cutoff) in ChR2- LN. We calculated the effect size using Cohen’s d, and restricted our gene lists to only those genes with a non-negligible effect size, using a cutoff of 0.2 (analysis of the effect of various effect-size cutoffs in Figure S7 F). The results of these analyses for each cell type can be found in Table S3 . In Figure 7 H, we further restricted our DE gene lists for heatmap visualization, and in Figure 7 J for gene ontology analysis (using DAVID, as described above) by only including genes that were also DE between LNs harvested from the same mouse in at least 2 of 4 ChR2+ mice.
Using prism software, we performed unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests for Figures 1 E, 1H, and 5 F, Welch’s t tests for Figures 5 G, 5H, 5K, 5L, S1 G, S3 C, S4 N, and S4O, 2-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test with for Figure S7 E. All other statistical tests corresponding to differential gene expression or assessment of interaction potential are described above and completed using R language for Statistical Computing. Tests of correlation and correlation significance are annotated by the correlation model used (Pearson versus Spearman) were completed using R language for Statistical Computing. Parameters such as sample size, number of replicates, number of independent experiments, measures of center, dispersion, and precision (mean ± SEM) and statistical significances are reported in Figures and Figure Legends. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant unless otherwise reported; a more stringent cutoff of 0.01 was used in some instances, and annotated as such. Where appropriate, a Holm correction was used to account for multiple tests, as noted in the figure legends or STAR Methods .
