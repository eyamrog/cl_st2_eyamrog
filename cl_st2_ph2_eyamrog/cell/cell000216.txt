Title: Phase Separation of Disease-Associated SHP2 Mutants Underlies MAPK Hyperactivation


Abstract: Summary

The non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP2, encoded by PTPN11 , plays an essential role in RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling during normal development. It has been perplexing as to why both enzymatically activating and inactivating mutations in PTPN11 result in human developmental disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations. Here, we uncover a common liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior shared by these disease-associated SHP2 mutants. SHP2 LLPS is mediated by the conserved well-folded PTP domain through multivalent electrostatic interactions and regulated by an intrinsic autoinhibitory mechanism through conformational changes. SHP2 allosteric inhibitors can attenuate LLPS of SHP2 mutants, which boosts SHP2 PTP activity. Moreover, disease-associated SHP2 mutants can recruit and activate wild-type (WT) SHP2 in LLPS to promote MAPK activation. These results not only suggest that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of SHP2-associated human diseases but also provide evidence that PTP may be regulated by LLPS that can be therapeutically targeted.

Section: Introduction

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is crucial for regulating numerous cellular signaling transduction pathways. Disruption of the normal homeostasis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in the etiology of a variety of major human diseases ( Böhmer et al., 2013 6.

Cell Biol. 2006; 7 :833-846 Crossref Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ). Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) represent the largest family of phosphatases regulating the homeostasis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. PTPs have long been erroneously assumed to be constitutively active and housekeeping enzymes, and it has been recognized that cells have to tightly control PTP activity to fine-tune and limit the extent and duration of signaling transduction ( Tonks, 2006 43. Tonks, N.K. Protein tyrosine phosphatases: from genes, to function, to disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7 :833-846 Crossref Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the underlying regulatory mechanism is not well elucidated, which is of great importance for developing new therapeutic strategies for many human diseases.
SHP2, a ubiquitous non-receptor PTP encoded by PTPN11 , is required for RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway activation and normal development ( Tajan et al., 2015 39. Tajan, M. ∙ de Rocca Serra, A. ∙ Valet, P. ... SHP2 sails from physiology to pathology Eur. J. Med. Genet. 2015; 58 :509-525 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutations in PTPN11 are linked to numerous human diseases ( Bowen et al., 2011 7. Bowen, M.E. ∙ Boyden, E.D. ∙ Holm, I.A. ...

Noonan syndrome and related disorders: genetics and pathogenesis Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6 :45-68 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Germline heterozygous mutations of PTPN11 are associated with 50% Noonan syndrome (NS) ( Tartaglia and Gelb, 2005 41. Tartaglia, M. ∙ Gelb, B.D. Noonan syndrome and related disorders: genetics and pathogenesis Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6 :45-68 Crossref Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 90% Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NS-ML, formally called Leopard syndrome) ( Digilio et al., 2002 13. Digilio, M.C. ∙ Conti, E. ∙ Sarkozy, A. ... Grouping of multiple-lentigines/LEOPARD and Noonan syndromes on the PTPN11 gene Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71 :389-394 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (334) PubMed Google Scholar ). Somatic SHP2 mutations are found in 35% of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemias (JMMLs) and other related malignancies ( Tartaglia et al., 2004 42. Tartaglia, M. ∙ Martinelli, S. ∙ Cazzaniga, G. ...

Isolation of a distinct class of gain-of-function SHP-2 mutants with oncogenic RAS-like transforming activity from solid tumors Oncogene. 2008; 27 :3508-3515 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). In marked contrast to the activating mutations associated within NS and cancer, which are viewed as gain-of-function (GOF), all NS-ML mutations cause a decrease in SHP2 phosphatase activity and therefore are regarded as loss-of-function (LOF) ( Kontaridis et al., 2006 23.

Chem. 2006; 281 :6785-6792 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (268) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, NS-ML clinically resembles NS, raising a long debated question why both GOF and LOF mutations of SHP2 result in similar clinical manifestations ( Edouard et al., 2007 16. Edouard, T. ∙ Montagner, A. ∙ Dance, M. ... How do Shp2 mutations that oppositely influence its biochemical activity result in syndromes with overlapping symptoms? Cell. Mol.

Med. 2009; 2 :17-25 PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, both NS and NS-ML are predisposed to an elevated risk of malignancy ( Cheng et al., 2013 10. Cheng, Y.P. ∙ Chiu, H.Y. ∙ Hsiao, T.L. ...

Genetic evidence for lineage-related and differentiation stage-related contribution of somatic PTPN11 mutations to leukemogenesis in childhood acute leukemia Blood. 2004; 104 :307-313 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations suggest that LOF mutations of SHP2 may, similarly as GOF mutations, also acquire capability to activate the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway.
SHP2 is an allosteric enzyme composed of two tandem SH2 domains at its NH2-terminus (N-SH2 and C-SH2), a central PTP catalytic domain, and a C-terminal tail ( Hof et al., 1998 20. Hof, P. ∙ Pluskey, S. ∙ Dhe-Paganon, S. ... Crystal structure of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 Cell. 1998; 92 :441-450 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (824) PubMed Google Scholar ). The phosphatase activity of SHP2 is regulated by an elegant “molecular switch” mechanism in which SHP2 is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its N-SH2 domain and the PTP domain in the basal state ( Hof et al., 1998 20. Hof, P. ∙ Pluskey, S. ∙ Dhe-Paganon, S. ... Crystal structure of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 Cell. 1998; 92 :441-450 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (824) PubMed Google Scholar ). An intermolecular engagement of the N-SH2 domain with unique phosphor-tyrosine (pTyr) sequences from upstream growth factor receptors and/or scaffold proteins diminishes its intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction with the PTP domain, leading to an open and activated SHP2 state. GOF mutations of SHP2 in NS and JMML found in the interface of the N-SH2 and PTP domains abolish the autoinhibitory interaction between the two domains, whereas LOF mutations in NS-ML are located in the PTP domain causing impaired PTP activity ( Yu et al., 2013 49.

Structural reorganization of SHP2 by oncogenic mutations and implications for oncoprotein resistance to allosteric inhibition Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4508 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, previous studies have suggested that both NS/JMML SHP2 mutants and NS-ML SHP2 mutants have an increased tendency for adapting the open conformation ( Yu et al., 2013 49. Yu, Z.H. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Walls, C.D. ... Structural and mechanistic insights into LEOPARD syndrome-associated SHP2 mutations J. Biol.

Structural reorganization of SHP2 by oncogenic mutations and implications for oncoprotein resistance to allosteric inhibition Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4508 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the link of the conformation changes in SHP2 mutants to the molecular mechanism underlying SHP2-associated human diseases has not been fully understood.
Phase separation has emerged as a fundamental mechanism that regulates various biological processes. Biomolecular condensates mediated by phase separation form coherent structures that can compartmentalize and concentrate biochemical reactions within cells ( Alberti et al., 2019 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T. Considerations and challenges in studying liquid-liquid phase separation and biomolecular condensates Cell. 2019; 176 :419-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1505) PubMed Google Scholar ; Banani et al., 2017 5.

Previous studies reveal that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is triggered by multivalent interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins or by protein-interacting domains ( Li et al., 2012 26. Li, P. ∙ Banjade, S. ∙ Cheng, H.-C. ... Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins Nature. 2012; 483 :336-340 Crossref Scopus (1678) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 37.

Intrinsically disordered proteins in overcrowded milieu: Membrane-less organelles, phase separation, and intrinsic disorder Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2017; 44 :18-30 Crossref Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ). Research in the past years has provided mounting evidence that aberrant phase separation and liquid-to-solid phase transitions are involved in the process of neurodegenerative diseases ( Alberti and Dormann, 2019 1. Alberti, S. ∙ Dormann, D. Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation in Disease Annu. Rev. Genet. 2019; 53 :171-194 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hofweber et al., 2018 21.

However, very little is known about whether dysregulation of LLPS takes part in other human diseases, such as developmental disorders and cancers.
Here, we demonstrate that both NS/NS-ML and cancer-associated SHP2 mutants gain acquired capability of LLPS, which promotes its PTP enzymatic activity. The LLPS of SHP2 is driven by the conserved well-folded PTP domain through intermolecular electrostatic interactions and subjected to the intramolecular conformation regulation. The disease-associated SHP2 mutants can recruit wild-type (WT) SHP2 in phase-separated condensates and promote RAS-MAPK signaling. Moreover, SHP2 allosteric inhibitors can attenuate LLPS of SHP2 mutants. Our study reveals that LLPS provides a GOF mechanism in the pathogenesis of SHP2-associated human diseases that can possibily be used to therapeutically target LLPS for the treatment of human diseases.

Section: Results

To understand how disease-associated mutations affect SHP2 cellular function, we stably expressed six mEGFP-labeled SHP2 variants (WT, 3 NS/JMML mutants, and 2 NS-ML mutants) in KYSE520 cells, which is a SHP2-dependent esophagus cancer cell line ( Chen et al., 2016 9. Chen, Y.-N.P. ∙ LaMarche, M.J. ∙ Chan, H.M. ... Allosteric inhibition of SHP2 phosphatase inhibits cancers driven by receptor tyrosine kinases Nature. 2016; 535 :148-152 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 A). The expression levels of SHP2-mEGFP were comparable to that of endogenous SHP2 ( Figure S1 B). Remarkably, live cell fluorescence microscopy revealed that all of the SHP2 variants bearing disease-associated mutations formed discrete puncta, whereas SHP2 WT was apparently dispersed throughout the cell ( Figure 1 A). Disease-associated SHP2 mutants exceeded SHP2 WT not only in the number but also in the average size of puncta, as revealed by high-content image analysis ( Figures 1 B, S1 C, and S1D). The number of the puncta correlates with the average puncta size among the SHP2 variants ( Figure S1 E). Furthermore, similar mutation-specific puncta formation was also observed in experiments by using either mEGFP- or mScarlet-labeled SHP2 in several other cell lines, including HEK293T, A549, and HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) ( Figures S1 F–S1K). To rule out the possibility that the observed puncta formation was due to increased intracellular protein concentration by exogenous SHP2 expression, we further stably expressed mEGFP-labeled SHP2 variants and WT in SHP2 knockout HEK293T cells. The SHP2-mEGFP proteins were expressed at the same level as that of the endogenous SHP2 in parental HEK293T cells ( Figure S1 L). Again, we observed the puncta formation by mutant SHP2, but not by SHP2 WT ( Figure S1 M).
Notably, two cancer cell lines H661 and CCF-STTG1, which harbor an endogenous NS-associated SHP2 N58S and NS-ML-associated SHP2 R498W mutation, respectively, also exhibited SHP2 puncta, whereas the KYSE520 cells harboring two WT SHP2 alleles only had occasional SHP2 puncta revealed by immunofluorescence ( Figure S1 N). We next examined the presence of SHP2 puncta in more physiological settings. We found that both the mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from Ptpn11 D61G / + mice ( Araki et al., 2004 4. Araki, T. ∙ Mohi, M.G. ∙ Ismat, F.A. ... Mouse model of Noonan syndrome reveals cell type- and gene dosage-dependent effects of Ptpn11 mutation Nat. Med. 2004; 10 :849-857 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from Ptpn11 E76K / + mice ( Dong et al., 2016 14. Dong, L. ∙ Yu, W.M. ∙ Zheng, H. ... Leukaemogenic effects of Ptpn11 activating mutations in the stem cell microenvironment Nature. 2016; 539 :304-308 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2011 48. Xu, D. ∙ Liu, X. ∙ Yu, W.M. ... Non-lineage/stage-restricted effects of a gain-of-function mutation in tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (Shp2) on malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :1977-1988 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ) exhibited highly statistically significant numbers of SHP2 puncta, whereas very few puncta were found in WT MEFs or MSCs ( Figures 1 C, 1D, 1E, 1F, S1 O, and S1P). Moreover, a massive amount of SHP2 puncta was found in the oral mucosa cells from two NS patients harboring a SHP2 A72S mutation and a SHP2 Q79R mutation, respectively, but not in those of the two healthy donors ( Figures 1 G and 1H). These results clearly demonstrate that disease-associated mutant SHP2 exhibits a higher tendency to form puncta in cells.
LLPS has emerged as a fundamental regulatory mechanism in various biological processes ( Alberti and Dormann, 2019 1. Alberti, S. ∙ Dormann, D. Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation in Disease Annu. Rev. Genet. 2019; 53 :171-194 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ; Alberti et al., 2019 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T. Considerations and challenges in studying liquid-liquid phase separation and biomolecular condensates Cell. 2019; 176 :419-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1505) PubMed Google Scholar ; Banani et al., 2017 5. Banani, S.F. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Hyman, A.A. ... Biomolecular condensates: organizers of cellular biochemistry Nat. Rev. Mol.

Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2168) PubMed Google Scholar ). We assessed whether the mutant SHP2 puncta displayed any liquid-like features. Indeed, we observed that the puncta formed by both NS/JMML and NS-ML mutant SHP2 could mobilize and spontaneously fuse upon encountering ( Figures 2 A, S2 A, and S2B; Videos S1 and S2 ). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showed that upon photobleaching, the fluorescence of mutant SHP2-mEGFP puncta recovered within minutes ( Figures 2 B, 2C, and S2 C–S2F; Videos S3 , S4 , and S5 ). To determine whether endogenous mutant SHP2 forms puncta displaying liquid-like features in live cells, we used CRISPR-Cpf1 to tag an endogenous SHP2 N58S mutant allele with mEGFP in H661 cells, followed by single clone expansion and confirmation by sequencing ( Figure S2 G). SHP2 N58S -mEGFP in the engineered H661 cells showed the same obvious condensate formation as the endogenous SHP2 N58S in the parental H661 cells ( Figures S1 N and S2 H). Moreover, the puncta of endogenously tagged SHP2 N58S -mEGFP in the engineered H661 cells also exhibited condensate fluidity assessed by FRAP experiments ( Figure 2 D). These results indicate that both NS/JMML and NS-ML mutations of SHP2 promote the formation of puncta that exhibit dynamic liquid-like behavior.

Time-Lapse Imaging Video of FRAP Experiments with SHP2 E76K -mEGFP Puncta in KYSE520 Cells, Related to Figure 2 Scale bar, 10 μm.
We next sought to examine if SHP2 possesses phase separation potential in vitro . We prepared recombinant WT and various disease-associated mutant SHP2 proteins ( Figures S3 A and S3B). We found that both NS/JMML and NS-ML mutants exhibited stronger capability for droplet formation than SHP2 WT ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Notably, the in vitro droplet formation potential of SHP2 mutants nicely correlated with their puncta formation capability inside the cells ( Figure 3 C). Droplets of mutant SHP2 tended to coalesce over time ( Figures 3 D and S3 C). Moreover, FRAP experiments showed that when bleaching was performed, the fluorescence of mutant SHP2-mEGFP in the droplets was efficiently recovered ( Figures 3 E, S3 D, and S3E), which further confirmed that SHP2 variants underwent typical LLPS in vitro .
Furthermore, we established the phase diagrams of SHP2 WT and two disease-associated mutants, namely, SHP2 E76K and SHP2 R498L by performing the droplet formation assay with various concentrations of SHP2 variants and sodium chloride. We observed that in the presence of 125 mM NaCl, which is close to the physiological salt concentration in cells ( Ando and Skolnick, 2010 3. Ando, T. ∙ Skolnick, J. Crowding and hydrodynamic interactions likely dominate in vivo macromolecular motion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :18457-18462 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ), both SHP2 E76K and SHP2 R498L proteins were able to undergo LLPS starting from 0.25–0.5 μM, whereas LLPS of SHP2 WT appears from the concentration of 2–4 μM ( Figure 3 F). We then measured the protein concentrations of endogenous SHP2 in various cell lines ( Du and Chen, 2018 15. Du, M. ∙ Chen, Z.J. DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling Science. 2018; 361 :704-709 Crossref Scopus (610) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that the concentration of SHP2 protein in cells is approximately 0.3 to 0.4 μM (0.3 μM in A549, 0.4 μM in HEK293T, and 0.4 μM in KYSE520) ( Figure S3 F). Assuming that SHP2 mutation occurs in one allele of PTPN11 , the concentration of endogenous SHP2 mutant (0.15–0.2 μM) is approximately close to the critical concentration of SHP2 mutants required for LLPS in vitro ( Figure 3 F), whereas the protein concentration of SHP2 WT in cells is much lower than the critical concentration of SHP2 WT for LLPS in vitro . This finding may help to explain why SHP2 mutants tend to form puncta in cells and SHP2 WT does not ( Figure 1 A). Together, these results demonstrate the differential LLPS behavior of disease-associated SHP2 mutants and SHP2 WT in cells and in vitro .
Previous structural and biophysical analyses of WT, NS/JMML mutations, and NS-ML mutations of SHP2 revealed that the degree of their propensities for the open conformation nicely correlated with the extent of increased dynamic and solvent exposure at the N-SH2/PTP domain interface and decreased N-SH2/PTP inter-domain interaction as a result of the mutations ( LaRochelle et al., 2018 24. LaRochelle, J.R. ∙ Fodor, M. ∙ Vemulapalli, V. ... Structural reorganization of SHP2 by oncogenic mutations and implications for oncoprotein resistance to allosteric inhibition Nat.

Yu, Z.-H. ∙ Zhang, R.-Y. ∙ Walls, C.D. ... Molecular basis of gain-of-function LEOPARD syndrome-associated SHP2 mutations Biochemistry. 2014; 53 :4136-4151 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 4 A and 4B). Interestingly, by quantifying the openness status of SHP2 mutants based on the results of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS) ( Yu et al., 2014 50. Yu, Z.-H. ∙ Zhang, R.-Y. ∙ Walls, C.D. ... Molecular basis of gain-of-function LEOPARD syndrome-associated SHP2 mutations Biochemistry. 2014; 53 :4136-4151 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that the LLPS capabilities of droplet formation of SHP2 mutants perfectly correlated with their propensities for the open conformation regardless of NS/JMML or NS-ML mutations ( Figures 4 C and 4D). This observation suggests that the ability to transition from the closed to the open conformation may determine the potential of SHP2 LLPS. To test this hypothesis, we used the SHP2 allosteric inhibitor SHP099 that could stabilize SHP2 in its auto-inhibited/closed conformation ( Chen et al., 2016 9. Chen, Y.-N.P. ∙ LaMarche, M.J. ∙ Chan, H.M. ... Allosteric inhibition of SHP2 phosphatase inhibits cancers driven by receptor tyrosine kinases Nature. 2016; 535 :148-152 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ; LaRochelle et al., 2018 24. LaRochelle, J.R. ∙ Fodor, M. ∙ Vemulapalli, V. ... Structural reorganization of SHP2 by oncogenic mutations and implications for oncoprotein resistance to allosteric inhibition Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4508 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 E). Indeed, the single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments revealed that SHP2 E76A was predominantly present in the open state; however, the addition of SHP099 dramatically reshaped the conformational landscape of SHP2 E76A toward the closed conformation ( Figures 4 F and S4 A). Interestingly, the addition of SHP099 significantly attenuated the droplet formation of mutant SHP2 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Consistently, the treatment with SHP099 also reduced the puncta formation of SHP2 mutants in cells ( Figures 4 I and 4J).
Furthermore, the degree of puncta reduction was correlated with the extent of SHP2 inhibition, as ET070, a more potent SHP2 allosteric inhibitor than SHP099 that we recently identified ( Figures S4 B–S4E), exhibited much stronger inhibition on the LLPS of SHP2 mutants in vitro ( Figures 4 G and 4H) and in cells than that of SHP099 ( Figures 4 I and 4J; Video S6 ). Moreover, puncta formation of both SHP2 D61G in Ptpn11 D61G/+ MEFs and SHP2 E76K in Ptpn11 E76K/+ MSCs was strongly abolished by the treatment of ET070 ( Figures S4 F and S4G). Conversely, treatment with the stimulating peptide 2P-IRS-1, which contains bi-pTyr (bi-phosphorylated tyrosine) that can bind to both N- and C-SH2 domains and unlock the intramolecular interaction of the N-SH2 domain with the PTP domain ( Chen et al., 2016 9. Chen, Y.-N.P. ∙ LaMarche, M.J. ∙ Chan, H.M. ... Allosteric inhibition of SHP2 phosphatase inhibits cancers driven by receptor tyrosine kinases Nature. 2016; 535 :148-152 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 K), promoted the droplet formation of SHP2 Y279C that had relatively weak LLPS capability ( Figures 4 L and 4M).

Time-Lapse Imaging Video of SHP2 R498L -mEGFP Puncta in KYSE520 Cells Treated with ET070, Related to Figure 4 Scale bar, 10 μm.
We next investigated whether LLPS is an intrinsic property of SHP2 and if the open conformation could drive SHP2 WT to undergo LLPS. We found that 2P-IRS-1 also promoted SHP2 WT condensate formation in vitro ( Figure S4 H). Remarkably, treatment of growth factors such as bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced SHP2 WT -mEGFP puncta formation in KYSE520 cells ( Figure S4 I; Video S7 ), suggesting that SHP2 WT is able to undergo LLPS when the closed conformation is unlocked.

We next sought to reveal the molecular basis underlying SHP2 phase separation. Unlike most well-documented examples of proteins that can undergo LLPS, SHP2 does not contain low-complexity IDRs or repetitive multivalent modular domains ( Alberti et al., 2019 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T.

Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 :eaaf4382 Crossref Scopus (2168) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify the domain responsible for SHP2 LLPS, we prepared recombinant full-length WT SHP2 (FL-SHP2) and three truncated SHP2 (SHP2ΔC, N/C-SH2, and SHP2-PTP) ( Figures 5 A and S5 A). Notably, the catalytic PTP domain showed much stronger LLPS capability than that of FL-SHP2 and other variants ( Figures 5 B and 5C). The droplets of SHP2-PTP underwent fusion revealed by a fusion assay ( Figure S5 B). Intriguingly, the allosteric inhibitor SHP099 that efficiently attenuates full-length SHP2 mutant LLPS does not influence the droplet formation of SHP2-PTP ( Figure S5 C).
Because the surface of the PTP domain contains several negative and positive patches ( Böhmer et al., 2013 6. Böhmer, F. ∙ Szedlacsek, S. ∙ Tabernero, L. ... Protein tyrosine phosphatase structure-function relationships in regulation and pathogenesis FEBS J. 2013; 280 :413-431 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tonks, 2006 43. Tonks, N.K. Protein tyrosine phosphatases: from genes, to function, to disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7 :833-846 Crossref Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next examined whether electrostatic interactions might be involved in mediating SHP2 LLPS. Indeed, the droplet formation of SHP2-PTP was highly sensitive to the increased concentration of NaCl ( Figure 5 D). To further pinpoint the essential charged patches mediating SHP2-PTP LLPS, we generated 17 SHP2 mutants, including 16 double mutations and 1 single mutation distributed on the different charged patches of the SHP2-PTP surface ( Figures S6 A and S6B). We found that 6 mutants (R362E/K364E, E523K/D437K, E447K/E481K, E441K/D437K, E447K/D451K, and R265E) significantly impaired the droplet formation of SHP2-PTP ( Figure S6 C). Among them, the E523/D437, E447/E481, E441/D437, and E447/D451 mutations are distributed on the two negatively charged patches (NCPs), whereas R362/K364 and R265 are located on the two positively charged patches (PCPs) ( Figure S6 D). These results suggest that multiple NCPs and PCPs on the surface of SHP2-PTP proteins mediate intermolecular electrostatic interactions for SHP2-PTP LLPS. Among the different charged patches, the R362/K364-containing patch may play a dominant role because the R362E/K364E mutation nearly abolished the LLPS capability of SHP2-PTP ( Figures 5 E and 5F) without perturbing its overall structure or PTP activity ( Figures S6 B, S6E, and S6F). Strikingly, when introduced in disease-associated SHP2 mutants, the R362E/K364E mutation totally eliminated the puncta formation by different SHP2 mutants in cells ( Figure 5 G).
SHP2 is a key positive mediator for RAS-MAPK signaling. NS and NS-ML syndromes, caused by PTPN11 mutations ( Tajan et al., 2015 39. Tajan, M. ∙ de Rocca Serra, A. ∙ Valet, P. ... SHP2 sails from physiology to pathology Eur. J. Med. Genet. 2015; 58 :509-525 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), belong to a newly classified family of autosomal dominant syndromes termed “RASopathies” ( Tajan et al., 2018 40. Tajan, M. ∙ Paccoud, R. ∙ Branka, S. ... The RASopathy family: consequences of germline activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway Endocr. Rev. 2018; 39 :676-700 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nakamura et al., 2009 32. Nakamura, T. ∙ Gulick, J. ∙ Pratt, R. ... Noonan syndrome is associated with enhanced pERK activity, the repression of which can prevent craniofacial malformations Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :15436-15441 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that both NS and NS-ML mutant SHP2, but not SHP2 WT , enhanced both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels when stably expressed in cells ( Figure 6 A). Remarkably, although the LLPS-defective R362E/K364E mutation had no effect on SHP2 PTP activity ( Figures S6 E and S6F), they attenuated ERK1/2 activation induced by these disease-associated SHP2 mutants ( Figures 6 B and 6C), suggesting that LLPS of disease-associated SHP2 mutants is essential for ERK1/2 hyperactivation.
Given that LLPS can locally concentrate molecules in condensates to accelerate reactions ( Alberti et al., 2019 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Gladfelter, A. ∙ Mittag, T.

Su, X. ∙ Ditlev, J.A. ∙ Hui, E. ... Phase separation of signaling molecules promotes T cell receptor signal transduction Science. 2016; 352 :595-599 Crossref Scopus (779) PubMed Google Scholar ), we next examined if LLPS could boost the PTP activity of SHP2. Indeed, enzymatic assays revealed that droplets of SHP2 variants displayed more robust PTP activity under an LLPS condition than the corresponding mutants under a solution condition ( Figure 6 D). The dephosphorylation product (DiFMU) of DiFMUP ( 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate), an in vitro artificial substrate of SHP2, was concentrated in SHP2 E76A droplets ( Figure 6 E), suggesting that SHP2 PTP activity was enhanced in the phase-separated condensates.
As shown in Figure 6 D, the enhanced PTP activity of NS-ML mutants by LLPS was still weaker than that of SHP2 WT , which does not support the observation that MAPK signaling is elevated by NS-ML SHP2 mutations ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Given that NS-ML patients are genetically heterozygous mutation carriers, we next asked if the WT allele of SHP2 could contribute to ERK1/2 hyperactivation in cells expressing NS-ML mutant SHP2. We transfected HEK293T cells with a 1:1 mixture of SHP2 WT and SHP2 Y279C plasmids and observed a clear elevation of pERK1/2 levels compared to that of equal amounts of SHP2 WT or SHP2 Y279C expression alone ( Figure 7 A). Interestingly, the ratio of WT and NS-ML SHP2 was critical because ERK1/2 was maximally activated when the levels of SHP2 WT and SHP2 Y279C were approximately equal when transfected in either parental HEK293T or SHP2 KO HEK293T cells ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S7 A). Moreover, we generated a Tet-inducible SHP2 Y279C -mEGFP stable KYSE520 cell line and titrated the expression of SHP2 Y279C -mEGFP with different concentrations of doxycycline. The level of pERK1/2 peaked when SHP2 Y279C -mEGFP was expressed at the same level as the endogenous SHP2 ( Figure S7 B). These results suggest that an interaction of WT and NS-ML mutant SHP2 might provide a mechanistic basis for ERK1/2 hyperactivation, as reported by independent lines of research in knockin animal models and NS-ML patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that NS-ML SHP2 mutations result in hyperactivated RAS-MAPK ( Carvajal-Vergara et al., 2010 8. Carvajal-Vergara, X. ∙ Sevilla, A. ∙ D’Souza, S.L. ... Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived models of LEOPARD syndrome Nature. 2010; 465 :808-812 Crossref Scopus (590) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oishi et al., 2009 34. Oishi, K. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Gault, W.J. ... Phosphatase-defective LEOPARD syndrome mutations in PTPN11 gene have gain-of-function effects during Drosophila development Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18 :193-201 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We then questioned if NS-ML mutant SHP2 could form condensates to recruit SHP2 WT and promote ERK1/2 activation. Indeed, we observed that SHP2 WT was readily distributed into NS-ML mutant SHP2 droplets under which conditions SHP2 WT itself could not efficiently form droplets ( Figure 7 D). Although the overall droplet formation capability of a WT/mutant SHP2 mixture was compromised compared to a mutant SHP2 alone ( Figure S7 C), a significant portion of SHP2 WT s were enriched in mutant SHP2 droplets ( Figures S7 D and S7E). Moreover, SHP2 WT exhibited rapid recovery upon photobleaching ( Figure S7 F). Remarkably, droplets composed of the mixture of WT and NS-ML mutant SHP2 displayed stronger PTP activity than the droplets of each protein ( Figure 7 E). We next examined if SHP2 WT in SHP2 mutant cells could be recruited by the phase-separated puncta of NS-ML mutant SHP2. SHP2 WT -mEGFP did not form puncta when transfected in KYSE520 cells ( Figure 1 A); however, when coexpressed with SHP2 R498L , SHP2 WT -mEGFP exhibited puncta that colocalized with SHP2 R498L puncta ( Figure 7 F). Similar results were obtained when SHP2 WT was coexpressed with SHP2 Y279C ( Figure S7 G). These results suggested that NS-ML mutant SHP2 could form condensates to recruit SHP2 WT and activate MAPK signaling ( Figure 7 G).

Section: Discussion

LLPS has been extensively studied as a regulatory mechanism of normal proteins in membraneless cellular compartments. In this study, we provided strong evidence demonstrating that disease-causing SHP2 mutant proteins present at endogenous levels display a dramatically higher propensity than that of WT SHP2 to form LLPS in several engineered cell lines, namely, MEFs and MSCs derived from Ptpn11 D61G / + and Ptpn11 E76K / + mice, and oral mucosa cells from NS patients. Given the broad spectrum of SHP2 mutations in human diseases, it will be interesting to expand this work and further examine whether the acquired LLPS capability is a general property for all disease-associated SHP2 mutants in NS and NS-ML, as well as in JMML and solid tumors. More importantly, from this study, we describe genetic mutations in SHP2 that directly endow phase separation capability as a GOF mechanism to activate MAPK signaling, which is critically important in RASopathy and tumorigenesis. Our discovery provides insights into a previously unappreciated function of LLPS in mediating the pathogenesis of human diseases. Our results suggest that catalytically impaired SHP2 mutants may exert GOF activity by facilitating LLPS to promote the activity of the SHP2 WT protein and MAPK hyperactivation in NS-ML patients, explaining the clinical similarities between NS and NS-ML. This finding also explains a long-standing puzzle as to why NS-ML patients carrying SHP2 inactivating mutations have an increased risk of developing hematological malignancies ( Uçar et al., 2006 45. Uçar, C. ∙ Calýskan, U. ∙ Martini, S. ... Acute myelomonocytic leukemia in a boy with LEOPARD syndrome (PTPN11 gene mutation positive) J. Pediatr. Hematol.

Dermatol. 2007; 157 :1297-1299 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), similar to NS patients who harbor SHP2 activating mutations. Moreover, our results reveal that somatic mutations of SHP2 in cancer cells also promote SHP2 LLPS ( Figure S1 N), suggesting that LLPS of SHP2 mutants may provide a cancer-driving mechanism that directly links to tumorigenesis by promoting ERK1/2 activation.
Given that the substrate dephosphorylation by PTP is biochemically passive and spontaneous, it is vital for PTP activity to be tightly fine-tuned during signaling transduction in cells. Here, we showed that SHP2 WT also formed condensates when the cells were stimulated with various factors such as EGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), suggesting that LLPS may serve as a regulatory mechanism to control WT SHP2 PTP activity under physiological conditions. We found that the protein concentration of endogenous SHP2 is about 0.3–0.4 μM, close to the critical concentration of disease-associated SHP2 mutants for LLPS in vitro but largely below the critical concentration of SHP2 WT for LLPS ( Figures 3 F and S3 F). This finding may explain why SHP2 mutants but not SHP2 WT are prone to form phase-separated condensates in cells. In addition, other factors may also modulate SHP2 LLPS in cells. For instance, phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the upstream growth factor receptor could bind to the two SH2 domains of SHP2 and unlock its intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction with the PTP domain, which may lower the critical concentration of both WT and mutant SHP2 for LLPS in cells. In line with this idea, when cells are stimulated with growth factors, we do observe SHP2 WT puncta formation on the cell membrane ( Figure S4 H; Video S7 ). SHP2 may adopt LLPS as a reaction crucible for stimulating its enzymatic activity to promote dephosphorylation of its substrates and MAPK signaling. Notably, SHP2 can also function as adaptor proteins to recruit signal proteins ( Dance et al., 2008 12. Dance, M. ∙ Montagner, A. ∙ Salles, J.P. ... The molecular functions of Shp2 in the Ras/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway Cell. Signal. 2008; 20 :453-459 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that LLPS of SHP2 may also serve as a node to amplify signaling magnitude.
The SHP2 protein does not contain low-complexity IDRs that are typical for mediating protein LLPS ( Franzmann et al., 2018 17. Franzmann, T.M. ∙ Jahnel, M. ∙ Pozniakovsky, A. ... Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness Science. 2018; 359 :eaao5654 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nott et al., 2015 33. Nott, T.J. ∙ Petsalaki, E. ∙ Farber, P. ... Phase transition of a disordered nuage protein generates environmentally responsive membraneless organelles Mol. Cell. 2015; 57 :936-947 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study reveals that the well-folded conserved PTP domain can drive SHP2 LLPS mediated by the multivalent intermolecular electrostatic interactions. Given that PTP domains in other PTPs commonly contain multiple PCPs and NCPs on the protein surface areas ( Böhmer et al., 2013 6. Böhmer, F. ∙ Szedlacsek, S. ∙ Tabernero, L. ... Protein tyrosine phosphatase structure-function relationships in regulation and pathogenesis FEBS J. 2013; 280 :413-431 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), our finding may bring up an interesting hypothesis that LLPS may function as a general regulatory mechanism of PTPs.
Our study demonstrates that NS-ML SHP2 mutants induce a robust phase transition to liquid-like droplets in cells, which recruit and activate SHP2 WT to promote ERK1/2 activation. In our study, we found that although overexpression of NS-ML SHP2 alone may sustain or mildly increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation ( Figure S7 A) as observed previously ( Yu et al., 2013 49. Yu, Z.H. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Walls, C.D. ... Structural and mechanistic insights into LEOPARD syndrome-associated SHP2 mutations J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :10472-10482 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2014 50. Yu, Z.-H. ∙ Zhang, R.-Y. ∙ Walls, C.D. ... Molecular basis of gain-of-function LEOPARD syndrome-associated SHP2 mutations Biochemistry. 2014; 53 :4136-4151 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), SHP2 WT plays a critical role in ERK1/2 hyperactivation and the maximal pERK1/2 level was reached when the levels of WT and NS-ML SHP2 were approximately equal. This result may reflect the NS-ML disease condition, for which both WT and mutant allele of PTPN11 are expressed at comparable levels. This finding may also address the perplexing observation reported in previous studies on ERK1/2 activation induced by NS-ML SHP2 mutants ( Tajan et al., 2015 39. Tajan, M. ∙ de Rocca Serra, A. ∙ Valet, P. ... SHP2 sails from physiology to pathology Eur. J. Med. Genet. 2015; 58 :509-525 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). The different expression levels of mutant SHP2 compared to that of SHP2 WT may result in a different outcome in terms of ERK1/2 activation. Notably, it is reported that both pERK1/2 and pMEK1/2 levels are elevated in NS-ML patient-specific iPSC ( Carvajal-Vergara et al., 2010 8. Carvajal-Vergara, X. ∙ Sevilla, A. ∙ D’Souza, S.L. ... Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived models of LEOPARD syndrome Nature. 2010; 465 :808-812 Crossref Scopus (590) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing strong evidence that NS-ML SHP2 mutations indeed are GOF mutations to promote the MAPK signaling pathway by acquired capability of LLPS.
Our results demonstrate that the R362/K364-containing PCP (362/364PCP) of SHP2-PTP is important in mediating LLPS of SHP2 both in vitro and in cells. Intriguingly, despite that the 362/364PCP is exposed to solvent in the isolated PTP domain for mediating LLPS, it is partially masked by the N-SH2 in the full-length SHP2 when the protein is in the close conformation ( Figure S6 G). However, because the disease-associated mutations induce conformational transition of SHP2 from the close to the open state, the N-SH2 is detached from PTP that may allow 362/364PCP to be fully accessible for driving SHP2 LLPS ( Figure S6 G). This finding further supports that the open conformation promotes SHP2 LLPS.
An interesting hypothesis is that SHP2 WT may also adopt an open conformation when recruited in NS-ML mutant SHP2 droplets, as the 362/364PCP has to be exposed to enable phase separation. In the droplets, 362/364PCP, which is partially masked by the N-SH2 domain in the closed conformation, may gain new intermolecular interactions with other negative patches. These new intermolecular interactions may thus compete with the intramolecular interaction of N-SH2 and induce the conformational transition toward the open conformation. This may explain why WT/mutant SHP2 droplets exhibited more potent PTP activity than WT or mutant SHP2 droplets alone ( Figure 7 E). However, further study is needed to directly probe the conformations of SHP2 variants in the droplet. At last, the acquired LLPS capability of mutant SHP2 can be inhibited by SHP2 allosteric inhibitors that lock SHP2 in the closed formation, providing a therapeutic strategy to treat SHP2-associated developmental disorders.

Oral mucosal epithelial cells were collected from two NS patients harboring SHP2 A72S (male) and SHP2 Q79R mutation (female) and 2 healthy donors (1 male and 1 female), ages between 4 and 8 years old. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xin Hua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. We have also certified that the study was strictly in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans. Oral mucosal epithelial cells were obtained by gently scraping palate and gum using cotton swab, right after oral hygiene through brushing of teeth.
Cells were maintained accordingly to the guidance from American Type Culture Collection. Human HEK293T (female) and HEK293FT (female) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Human H661(male), CCF-STTG1(female), KYSE520(female), NCI-H1299(male), A549(male), SF268(female) and MV4;11(male) cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 .
All cell line identifiers are listed in the Key Resources Table . H661, H1299 and A549 cells obtained from Cell bank of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (SIBCB) and KYSE520, CCF-STTG1 and MV4;11 cells from Cobioer company have been authenticated by STR analysis and mycoplasma detection. HEK293T, HEK293FT and SF268 cells have been verified through periodic morphology checks and mycoplasma detection.
HUVEC cells isolated from the vein of the umbilical cord were purchased from Promocell(C-12203) and cultured in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium(C-22010, Promocell). Mouse MSC isolation has been described previously ( Dong et al., 2016 14. Dong, L. ∙ Yu, W.M. ∙ Zheng, H. ... Leukaemogenic effects of Ptpn11 activating mutations in the stem cell microenvironment Nature. 2016; 539 :304-308 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were sacrificed and rinsed with 75% ethanol for 3 minutes. Then, the compact bones and bone marrow were collected after muscle dissection. Bone marrow cells were seeded in a culture dish and then moved into the cell incubator. Compact bones were then crushed and digested with collagenase II for 1.5 h at 37°C and finally cultured in an incubator. MSCs were observed after 3 days of incubation without any disturbance. Both bone marrow and compact bone MSCs were purified by controlling the digesting time (no more than 3 minutes at room temperature), and then they were growth together. MSC markers were used to determine the purity of MSCs.
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were used in this study for the production of recombinant proteins. Cells were cultured in lysogeny broth (LB) medium at 37°C, 220rpm.
Transfection of plasmids into HEK293T/293FT was performed using Polyjet (SignaGen, SL100688) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate stable cells, retroviral and lentiviral infections were used. Briefly, HEK293FT cells were co-transfected with viral plasmids and packaging plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, culture medium was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Millipore), and used to infect cells of interest.
Cells were grown on 24-well glass bottom plate (Cellvis, P24-1.5H-N) and images were taken with the Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscopy system using a 100x oil objective (NA = 1.4). Cells were imaged on a heated stage (37°C) and supplemented with warmed (37°C) humidified air.
For experiments that SHP2 mut -mEGFP cells were treated with SHP099 or ET070, cells were imaged every 15 min after 10 μM SHP099 or ET070 was added.
Fluorescent images were processed and assembled into figures using LAS X (Leica) and Fiji.
KYSE520 cells expressing SHP2 WT and SHP2 mut (SHP2 D61G , SHP2 E76A , SHP2 E76K , SHP2 Y279C and SHP2 R498L )–mEGFP were seeded in 24-well glass bottom plate (Cellvis P24-1.5H-N) and images were obtained with the Operetta CLS™ high-content cell imaging analysis system (PerkinElmer Inc.,Waltham,MA,USA). The 63x objective lens was applied in each condition. Data was analyzed by images collected from 10 representative fields in each group. Single cells were identified based on Hoechst 33342 as reference, while the spots quantification was performed based on the area and intensity of the spots through mEGFP channel. GraphPad Prism is used to plot and analyze the high content image results.
FRAP assay was conducted using the FRAP module of the Leica SP8 confocal microscopy system. The SHP2 mut -mEGFP was bleached using a 488-nm laser beam. Bleaching was focused on a circular region of interest (ROI) using 100% laser power and time-lapse images were collected. Fluorescence intensity was measured using Fiji. Background intensity was subtracted and values are reported relative to pre-bleaching time points. GraphPad Prism is used to plot and analyze the FRAP results.
The full-length SHP2 (WT) gene was PCR amplified from a human cDNA library (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_002825.3 ). Various mutants of SHP2 were generated using standard PCR-based methods and confirmed by DNA sequencing. All constructs of human SHP2 were inserted into a pET28a vector. A coding sequence for a 6 × histidine tag was added on the N terminus to the constructs. These constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and grown in lysogeny broth (LB) medium at 37°C to an optical density at OD600 of 0.8. The expression of recombinant proteins was induced by 0.8 mM IPTG at 16°C for 18h. Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, cells were lysed in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 1mM PMSF, followed by supercentrifugation at 16000 rpm for 40 min at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap HP chelating column (GE healthcare) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT and proteins were eluted with the addition of 500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing SHP2 were concentrated and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) using buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT. Fractions were collected according to the results of SDS-PAGE, and then these proteins were concentrated to 10 mg/mL or more, and stored at −80°C.
For the LLPS assay, the purified SHP2 WT or SHP2 mut protein at 8 μM was mixed with a LLPS buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 12%(w/v) PEG3350 (Sigma) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Finally, 2 μL of each sample was pipetted onto a glass dish and imaged using a Leica microscope. Under the same conditions, 30 μL of each sample was added into 384-well white polystyrene plate with clear flat bottom, and the value of OD600 was measured by using a TECAN Infinite F PLEX Pro microplate reader (37°C, 10 hr).
For LLPS assays treated with allosteric inhibitor, 20/50μM SHP099 or ET070 was incubated with 8 μM SHP2 mut phase-separated droplets at 37°C for 15 min, and further transferred to 384-well white polystyrene plate for OD600 kinetics study. The microplate reader reads every 5 minutes and shakes 10 s before each reading (37°C, 10 hr).
For SHP2 Y279C in the presence of 2P-IRS-1 peptide, 4 μM SHP2 Y279C protein was incubated with 1 μM peptide or DMSO at 37°C for 15 min and further mixed with the LLPS buffer. Each sample was then subjected to OD600 kinetics study at 37°C for 10 hr.
Phase diagrams were generated by mixing SHP2 protein (varying from 0.125-8 μM, final) in phase separation buffer 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 12%(w/v) PEG3350 (Sigma), sodium chloride (varying from 50-500 mM). Droplet turbidity OD600 was measured by microplate reader as described above.
CRISPR-Cpf1 was used ( Li et al., 2018 27. Li, B. ∙ Zeng, C. ∙ Dong, Y. Design and assessment of engineered CRISPR-Cpf1 and its use for genome editing Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :899-914 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar , Zetsche et al.,2015 51. Zetsche, B. ∙ Gootenberg, J.S. ∙ Abudayyeh, O.O. ... Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease of a class 2 CRISPR-Cas system Cell. 2015; 163 :759-771 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3284) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate endogenously-mEGFP-tagged SHP2 in SHP2 N58S H661 and SHP2 WT HEK293T cells. Oligos coding for guide RNAs targeting the C terminus of SHP2 was 5′-AGATGAGAAAACCTGCCAAAACT-3′. Repair templates were cloned into a pUC57 vector containing mEGFP, a GGS linker and 800 bp homology arms flanking the insert. H661 and HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 0.6 μg pcDNA3.1-hAsCpf1 vector, 0.6 μg pUC57-U6-gRNA and 0.8 μg pUC57-PTPN11-HR-donor repair templates using lipofectamine 3000. Cells were sorted 3 days after transfection for mEGFP and colonies were picked 14 days after seeding into 96 well plates. Cells were further passaged into 2 plates. One was used for genotyping by Sanger sequencing and the other was for imaging.
Primers for PCR amplification of Knock in fragment: F: 5′ -TGACATCGCGGAGATGGTTT- 3′ R: 5′-GCTGAACTTGTGGCCGTTTA- 3′
And following primers were used for Sanger sequencing: F: 5′-GAGAGAAGACAGTGCTAGAGTCTATG-3′ R: 5′-CATCTCCATTCTTCTCTTTTAATTGC-3′
Oligos coding for guide RNAs targeting the N terminus of SHP2 were cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 backbone. The sequence targeted for SHP2 is 5′- GTTACTGACCTTTCAGAGGT-3′. Cloned plasmids were co-transfected with psPax2 and pMD2.G viral packaging plasmids using polyjet in HEK293FT cells and viral supernatants were harvested after 48h. 293T cells were infected with lentiviral supernatants and selected by 1 μg/mL puromycin. After two days selection, media was replaced and selected pool cells were expanded in normal media for rescue experiments. HEK293T knock-out pool cells were infected with SHP2 WT -mEGFP, SHP2 E76K -mEGFP and SHP2 R498L -mEGFP virus supernatants and sorted for further imaging. For re-expressing different ratios of WT/Y279C, HEK293T knock-out pool cells plated on 12-well plate were transiently transfected with 0.8 μg pMSCV-SHP2(Flag-WT+HA-Y279C) plasmids per well by polyjet.
SHP2 Y279C -mEGFP was cloned into pInducer20 vector and packaged into lentivirus with psPax2 and pMD2.G as described above. KYSE520 cells were infected with lentiviral supernatants and selected by 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were treated with different concentrations (100, 50, 10, 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 ng/mL) of doxycycline for 3 days to induce the expression of SHP2 Y279C -mEGFP and western blot was performed to valid the expression level.
The concentration of endogenous SHP2 protein was measured following the previously reported protocol ( Du and Chen, 2018 15. Du, M. ∙ Chen, Z.J. DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling Science. 2018; 361 :704-709 Crossref Scopus (610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the quantification was based on the western blot densitometry analysis performed on cell lysates and purified SHP2 WT protein. A549, HEK293T and KYSE520 cells were lysed in WB/IP lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and subjected to western blot with 3-0.063 μM purified SHP2 WT protein. After densitometry analysis of western blot result by Fiji, we plotted band density against purified SHP2 WT concentration. The measured volume of collected cells was calibrated with the maximal spherical stacking coefficient (0.74).
Through an engineered tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase system, SHP2 E76A with two Azido-p-Phe incorporated at Q87/K266 was expressed and purified. The fluorophores (Cy3 as FRET donor and Cy5 as FRET acceptor) were further conjugated to Azido- SHP2 E76A −87/266 via click reaction. Imaging was collected w/o SHP099 in imaging buffer and incubated for 10 min before image acquisition was started. Single-molecule imaging was performed on a prism-type total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope equipped with a dual-laser excitation system (532 and 640 nm Crystal Laser) to excite Cy3 or Cy5. Fluorescence signals were collected by a water immersion objective lens (60X, NA: 1.2) and then passed through a notch filter to block out excitation beams. The emission signals from Cy3 and Cy5 were separated by a dichroic mirror and detected by the electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (iXon 897; Andor Technology). Data were recorded with a time resolution of 200 ms as a stream of imaging frames and analyzed with scripts written in interactive data language to give fluorescence intensity time trajectories of individual molecules. An oxygen scavenging system consisting of 0.8 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.625% glucose, 3 mM Trolox and 0.03 mg/ml catalase was added in the imaging buffer to avoid photobleaching.
Preprocessing and analyses of single-channel current recordings were performed offline with smCamera software written in C++ (Microsoft) which was generously provided by Taekjip Ha (Johns Hopkins University). FRET efficiency, E, was calculated as E FRET = I A /(I A +I D ), in which I A and I D are the donor and acceptor intensity after background subtraction. Cy3 and Cy5 channel were mapped using tetraSpeck fluorescent microsphere beads (Invitrogen, 0.1 μM) by mapping tool in smCamera. Traces extracted from the movies were selected based on the following acceptance criteria ( Wang et al., 2016 47. Wang, S. ∙ Vafabakhsh, R. ∙ Borschel, W.F. ... Structural dynamics of potassium-channel gating revealed by single-molecule FRET Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 :31-36 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tsuboyama et al., 2018 44. Tsuboyama, K. ∙ Tadakuma, H. ∙ Tomari, Y. Conformational activation of argonaute by distinct yet coordinated actions of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperone systems Mol. Cell. 2018; 70 :722-729.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ): (1) no more than one bleaching step for both donor and acceptor fluorophores; (2) traces showing a clear anticorrelated pattern; (3) lifetimes of both donor and acceptor fluorophore longer than 8 s. All smFRET trajectories that met these criteria were used to calculate the apparent FRET efficiency and to generate population FRET histograms. Error bars in the histograms represent the s.e.m. from at least three independent movies. The bin size of all histograms was set as 0.02. To make sure real FRET transitions, all transitions were manually inspected based on anti-correlation of the donor and acceptor intensity signals. All the experiments were repeated at least three times and no significant difference was found between these replicates.
The secondary structure of SHP2 and variants was measured by a Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, UK) at the room temperature. PTP or PTP mut proteins were purified with His-tag and diluted into 4 μM in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. Spectra were recorded at 200–260 nm with a step size of 1 nm and a cell path length of 1mm. Each sample was scanned three times. Pro-Data Viewer is used to analyze the data. Secondary structural content of each protein was determined by analysis of the CD spectrum using BeStSel.
The purified SHP2 WT -mEGFP and mutants (SHP2 E76A , SHP2 E76K , SHP2 Y279C , SHP2 R498L ) were pre-cleared via high-speed centrifugation. Briefly, the two proteins of SHP2 WT -mEGFP and each SHP2 mutant were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 at final concentration 8 μM and incubated at 37°C overnight. Then, samples were centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Supernatant and pellet were separated into two tubes immediately after centrifugation. The pellet fraction was washed with the LLPS buffer and re-suspended with the same buffer to the equal volume as supernatant. Proteins from supernatant and pellet fraction were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained with Coomassie blue.
The surrogate substrate 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) (Invitrogen) was used to monitor the catalytic activity of SHP2 in a fluorescence assay format. The phosphatase reactions were performed at room temperature in 96-well black polystyrene plate, flat bottom (Costar) with a final volume of 100 μL. The assay buffer contains 60 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 75 mM NaCl, 75 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA. The full-length wild-type various mutations of SHP2 enzymes (5 ng/μL) were diluted with reaction buffer, then the substrate DiFMUP was added, and immediately Ex/Em at 358/455 was measured with a kinetic process for 20 min. The SHP2 WT (5 nM) was co-incubated with of bisphosphorylated IRS-1 peptide (2.5 μM, sequence: LN(p-Y)IDLDLV(PEG8)LST(p-Y)ASINFQK-NH2) and the inhibitory compounds (SHP099 or ET070, 0.001μM −10μM) for 30 min at room temperature. The substrate DiFMUP was added and incubated for 30min at room temperature, and Ex/Em at 358/455 was measured. The SHP2 E76A or SHP2 E76K enzyme (5 μg/μL) was co-incubated with the compounds (SHP099 or ET070, 0.001μM −10μM) for 20min, then the substrate DiFMUP was added to the reaction, incubated for another 20 min, and Ex/Em at 358/455 was measured by a microplate reader (Envision, Perkin-Elmer). The IC 50 data was derived from the binding curve, which was fitted by the responsed-variable slope equation by using the GraphPad Prism5 software.
For phosphatase assay conducted in droplet condition, the purified wild-type, mutants or truncations of SHP2 at 8 μM was added to a LLPS buffer or solution buffer and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 mM pNPP(NEB) substrate and the OD405 of product was acquired every 10 s (shakes 10 s before each reading) by the microplate reader (Envision, Perkin-Elmer). Images to examine the phosphatase activity were collected using substrate DiFMUP. After the formation of phase-separated droplets, 2 μL of each sample was pipetted onto a coverslip. Images were collected once the substrate was added.
Cells were seeded in 24-well plate with a coverslip in each well and grown overnight. After 4% PFA fixation for 15minutes at room temperature, cells were treated with 0.4% Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% BSA. Diluted SHP2 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-7384) was applied to the coverslip and incubated overnight at 4°C. After PBS washing, corresponding fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibody was applied at room temperature for 1h and further PBS washed. After mounting with DAPI, examined the slides under the fluorescence microscope.
Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA lysis buffer (P0013B, Beyotime) or 2 × loading buffer, then separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Membrane was blocked with 5% (m/v) BSA for 1 hr at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight and second antibodies at room temperature. The following antibodies were used: pERK (CST#4370S), ERK (CST#9102S), SHP2 (CST#3397T), HA (CST#2367S), FLAG(Sigma# F1804) GAPDH (CST #2118S) and α-tubulin (abcam# ab52866), pMEK1/2(S217/221) (CST#9154), MEK1/2(CST#9122).
KYSE520 and MV4;11 cells (3000 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plate culture overnight and treated with SHP099 or ET070 at concentrations varying from 10 μM to 0.0005 μM for 96 h. 50 μL CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) was added and the luminescent signal was determined according to the supplier’s instruction. The percentage of inhibition was normalized by the DMSO vehicle control.
Images were analyzed with Fiji. All data are presented as the mean ± standard error of mean (s.e.m.) or standard deviation (s.d.) from independent determinations, and statistical analyses were done using the software Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc,; La Jolla, CA, USA).Differences of means were tested for statistical significance with unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001.
