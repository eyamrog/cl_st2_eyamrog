Title: Coupling of N7-methyltransferase and 3′-5′ exoribonuclease with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase reveals mechanisms for capping and proofreading


Abstract: Summary

The capping of mRNA and the proofreading play essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex (RTC) in a form identified as Cap(0)-RTC, which couples a co-transcriptional capping complex (CCC) composed of nsp12 NiRAN, nsp9, the bifunctional nsp14 possessing an N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), and nsp10 as a cofactor of nsp14. Nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN recruit nsp10/nsp14 into the Cap(0)-RTC, forming the N7-CCC to yield cap(0) ( 7Me GpppA) at 5′ end of pre-mRNA. A dimeric form of Cap(0)-RTC observed by cryo-EM suggests an in trans backtracking mechanism for nsp14 ExoN to facilitate proofreading of the RNA in concert with polymerase nsp12. These results not only provide a structural basis for understanding co-transcriptional modification of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA but also shed light on how replication fidelity in SARS-CoV-2 is maintained.

Section: Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1–nsp16) to assemble the replication-transcription complex (RTC) that plays key roles in the replication of genome-length viral RNAs and in the transcription of viral mRNAs ( Wu et al., 2020 51.

Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :325-328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1693) PubMed Google Scholar ). CoV mRNAs bear a 5′ cap(1) structure ( 7Me GpppA 2′OMe ) that plays an essential role in the life cycle of the virus ( Daffis et al., 2010 11. Daffis, S. ∙ Szretter, K.J. ∙ Schriewer, J. ... 2′-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap evades host restriction by IFIT family members Nature. 2010; 468 :452-456 Crossref Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ). In SARS-CoV-2 RTC, co-transcriptional capping of mRNA occurs after elongation initiation by four sequential actions in the co-transcriptional capping complex(s) (CCC) ( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ...

The first and the second capping actions that sequentially generate the 5′-diphosphate end (ppA) and the cap core (GpppA) at the 5′ end of the nascent pre-mRNA by nsp13 and the nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain in nsp12. In the subsequent capping actions, an N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) in nsp14 methylates the first guanine of GpppA at the N7-position to produce the cap(0) ( 7Me GpppA), being the substrate for the final capping action facilitated by a 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) in nsp16 to yield the mature mRNA ( Bouvet et al., 2010 2.

CoV nsp14 is a bifunctional enzyme bearing an N-terminal exonuclease (ExoN) domain that has been implicated in proofreading to maintain replication fidelity ( Eckerle et al., 2007 14.

USA. 2009; 106 :3484-3489 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ). The C-terminal N7-MTase adopts an atypical MTase fold with a conserved DxG S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding motif ( Case et al., 2016 4. Case, J.B. ∙ Ashbrook, A.W. ∙ Dermody, T.S. ...

Structural basis and functional analysis of the SARS coronavirus nsp14-nsp10 complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :9436-9441 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared with the canonical MTase fold, an insertion of a three-stranded β sheet between the canonical MTase β5/β6 strands is observed in CoV nsp14. A similar insertion is also observed in Vaccinia virus N7-MTase( Grimm et al., 2019 21. Grimm, C. ∙ Hillen, H.S. ∙ Bedenk, K. ... Structural Basis of Poxvirus Transcription: Vaccinia RNA Polymerase Complexes Cell. 2019; 179 :1537-1550 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). The binding site of SAM is in the space between the loops connecting strands β2′-β3′ and β3′-β4′ and is adjacent to the GpppA binding site ( Ma et al., 2015 25. Ma, Y. ∙ Wu, L. ∙ Shaw, N. ...

The N-terminal ExoN is a member of the DEDDh exonuclease superfamily and possesses a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity proposed to correct errors in replication by removing mis-incorporated nucleotides from the 3′ end of the nascent RNA strand ( Ferron et al., 2018 18.

Microbiol. 2019; 10 :1813 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). A feature of this exonuclease is that it has a proofreading mechanism to maintain the replication fidelity of the ~29.7 kb CoV genome. Nsp14 ExoN has also been shown to play roles in sub-genomic mRNA recombination and primary viral RNA synthesis ( Gribble et al., 2021 20. Gribble, J. ∙ Stevens, L.J. ∙ Agostini, M.L. ...

Virol. 2020; 94 :e01246 20 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). The proofreading is suggested to be a factor that impacts the inhibitory efficacy of nucleotide analog inhibitors ( Robson et al., 2020 36. Robson, F. ∙ Khan, K.S. ∙ Le, T.K. ... Coronavirus RNA Proofreading: Molecular Basis and Therapeutic Targeting Mol. Cell. 2020; 80 :1136-1138 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Escape from nsp14 ExoN proofreading is suggested to be associated with enhanced inhibitory efficacy of β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-1931) and derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 that has resistance mutations to remdesivir ( Robson et al., 2020 36.

An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and multiple coronaviruses in mice Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12 :eabb5883 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the function of nsp14 requires its association with a virus-encoded cofactor nsp10 ( Ma et al., 2015 25. Ma, Y. ∙ Wu, L. ∙ Shaw, N. ... Structural basis and functional analysis of the SARS coronavirus nsp14-nsp10 complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :9436-9441 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nsp10 exclusively binds with and confers structural integrity and stability to nsp14 ExoN and thus enhances the activity of nsp14 ExoN over 35-fold, preferring to use double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with a 3′ mis-matched substrate that mimics an erroneous replication product ( Bouvet et al., 2010 2.

Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :9372-9377 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). But nsp10 does not impact the structure and the activity of nsp14 N7-MTase ( Bouvet et al., 2010 2.

In previous studies, the architectures of the central RTC (C-RTC) composed by nsp12 and cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 and the elongation RTC (E-RTC) composed by C-RTC and helicase (nsp13) have been revealed, and the structure of Cap(−1)′-RTC formed by E-RTC with a single-strand RNA binding protein nsp9 reveals an intermediate state toward mRNA capping ( Chen et al., 2020 8.

Interactions between nsp14 (both N7-MTase and ExoN) and the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex ( Subissi et al., 2014 46. Subissi, L. ∙ Posthuma, C.C. ∙ Collet, A. ... One severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein complex integrates processive RNA polymerase and exonuclease activities Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :E3900-E3909 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicate its involvement in the assembly of the RTC. However, the structural details as to how the nsp10/nsp14 complex assembles remain elusive, impeding our understanding of the mechanisms of the function of nsp14 in mRNA capping and proofreading. To dissect these mechanisms, we generated a complex [identified as Cap(0)-RTC] formed by Cap(−1)′-RTC (i.e., nsp7-nsp8 2 -nsp9-nsp12-nsp13 2 -RNA) and nsp10/nsp14 and determined its cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure to 3.78 and 3.35 Å resolution in both monomeric and dimeric forms. The structure not only reveals the architecture of the capping machinery coupled to RTC that achieves the capping actions decorating the 5′ end of pre-mRNA but also provides a structural basis to understand the polymerase activity and the mechanism by which nsp14 ExoN is used for proofreading.

Section: Results

The recombinant proteins used to assemble Cap(0)-RTC were expressed in E. coli cells and purified ( Figure S1 A). In a native electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the addition of nsp10/nsp14 to Cap(−1)′-RTC resulted in a smeared upper-shifted band, indicating the formation of a potential complex, possibly in multiple forms ( Figure S1 B). With this sample, we collected a cryo-EM dataset containing 507 micrograph movies to determine whether a complex had formed. In total, 12% of the particles could be identified as belonging to Cap(−1)′-RTC with additional density, while the other particles had no clear features ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). A reconstruction using 5,985 particles gave a density map at 7.9 Å. Although the resolution was limited due to the small amount of particles, a convincing model could be built. We proposed that additional density adjacent to nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN likely corresponded to nsp10/nsp14 ( Figure S3 ). We therefore hypothesized the association of nsp9/nsp10/nsp14 may mediate the coupling of nsp10/nsp14 into Cap(0)-RTC, but the small number of interactions between them may result in a low number of complexes being formed or there being inherent flexibility when they associate.
A previous study has shown that the proteolytic processing of nsp9-nsp10 in coronaviruses is not required for virus proliferation and fitness, indicating a natural connection between nsp10 and nsp9 exists in the CoV life cycle ( Deming et al., 2007 13. Deming, D.J. ∙ Graham, R.L. ∙ Denison, M.R. ... Processing of open reading frame 1a replicase proteins nsp7 to nsp10 in murine hepatitis virus strain A59 replication J. Virol. 2007; 81 :10280-10291 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). A strategy where a linker is inserted to fuse two polypeptide components into one protein is an approach that can be used to improve the prospects of forming a homogeneous sample where two individual subunits may only weakly associate ( Shabek et al., 2018 41. Shabek, N. ∙ Ticchiarelli, F. ∙ Mao, H. ...

Molecular mimicry regulates ABA signaling by SnRK2 kinases and PP2C phosphatases Science. 2012; 335 :85-88 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2017 49. Wang, W. ∙ Li, J. ∙ Sun, Q. ... Structural insights into the coordination of plastid division by the ARC6-PDV2 complex Nat. Plants. 2017; 3 :17011 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using this approach, we fused the C terminus of nsp9 with the N terminus of nsp10 by using the natural polypeptide linker in the viral polyprotein connecting nsp9 and nsp10 and expressed this recombinant nsp9-nsp10 fusion protein together with nsp14 ( Figures S1 A and 1 C). This nsp9-nsp10 fusion protein forms a stable complex with nsp14 as occurs for nsp10 alone ( Figure 1 C). This purified nsp9-nsp10/nsp14 complex was thus subsequently used to assemble Cap(0)-RTC by incubating with E-RTC [i.e., Cap(−1)′-RTC excludes nsp9].
After collecting and processing 12,704 cryo-EM micrograph movies, 5 major classes were identified: 9.0% belong to a monomeric Cap(0)-RTC [hereafter named as mCap(0)-RTC], 15.3% belongs to a previously unobserved large particle representing a dimeric form of Cap(0)-RTC [hereafter named as dCap(0)-RTC], and 48.4% belongs to E-RTC, and another 2 classes belong to small fragments ( Figure S4 ). The classes representing mCap(0)-RTC (with 29,941 particles) and dCap(0)-RTC (with 47,981 particles) were reconstructed to resolutions of 3.35 and 3.78 Å, respectively ( Figure S4 ; Table S1 ). The high-quality density clearly shows the position of nsp10/nsp14 adjacent to nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN with a resolution of 3.0–4.5 Å in this region ( Figures S3 and S5 A). The local resolution for the density of nsp7-nsp8 2 -nsp9-nsp12 ranges from 3.0 to 4.0 Å. The local resolution for nsp13-2, which anchors the unpaired 5′ extension of the RNA template, is significantly optimized compared to previously reported RTC structures ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In mCap(0)-RTC, one nsp10/nsp14 complex associates with Cap(−1)′-RTC composed of one nsp7, two nsp8, one nsp9, one nsp12, two nsp13, and a paired template-primer RNA, being mediated by the contact of nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN with nsp14 ( Figures 1 A and 1B). The architecture of Cap(−1)′-RTC is generally similar to a previously reported structure ( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN make contacts with nsp14 ExoN to stabilize the association of nsp10/nsp14 in Cap(0)-RTC but do not interact with nsp14 N7-MTase. According to a previous definition, nsp13-1 refers to the helicase molecule that does not bind with RNA, while nsp13-2 refers to the helicase molecule that binds the 5′ extension of template ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 52.

In dCap(0)-RTC, two Cap(0)-RTC protomers are oriented by a 2-fold axis to form a dimer ( Figures 1 A and 1C; Figure S5 B). Nsp12 NiRAN and the palm of two Cap(0)-RTC protomers face each other and locate in the center of dCap(0)-RTC, while four nsp13s are at the two distal ends of the dimer. The binding of nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN with nsp14 ExoN is similar in both mCap(0)-RTC and dCap(0)-RTC. Nsp14 N7-MTase, which is distant from other components in one Cap(0)-RTC protomer, closely contacts with the nsp13-2 zinc binding domain (ZBD)′ and nsp12 thumb′ in another Cap(0)-RTC protomer, playing a key role in dimer formation. Moreover, nsp13-2, which anchors the unpaired 5′ extension of template RNA, shows a significant conformational change in dCap(0)-RTC, compared to nsp13-1 in dCap(0)-RTC, nsp13-2 in mCap(0)-RTC and other reported CoV helicase structures (discussed below).
In Cap(0)-RTC, nsp12 NiRAN, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp14 form a CCC catalyzing the methylation of the first guanine at the N7-position to produce the cap(0) ( 7Me GpppA)( Chen et al., 2009 5. Chen, Y. ∙ Cai, H. ∙ Pan, J. ... Functional screen reveals SARS coronavirus nonstructural protein nsp14 as a novel cap N7 methyltransferase Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :3484-3489 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ) (hereafter referred to as N7-CCC), being boundaried by nsp12 NiRAN and nsp9 from the elongation complex (EC) composed of nsp7, nsp8, nsp12 Interface/Thumb/Palm/Fingers, and nsp13 ( Figure 2 A).
In N7-CCC, the rod-shaped nsp10/nsp14 complex vertically inserts into and is stabilized by a canyon region formed by nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Nsp9 and nsp10 flank nsp14 ExoN from two sides to stabilize the assembly. Nsp14 N7-MTase protrudes distal from the interface of nsp14 with nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN. Although nsp10 is fused with nsp9 in Cap(0)-RTC, nsp10 does not contact with nsp9 except for the fusion residues, indicating again that the nsp9-nsp10 fusion does not affect the assembly of RTC. The catalytic center of nsp14 ExoN composed by residues D90/E92/E191/D273/H268 directly faces the central β sheet of nsp9. Moreover, the catalytic center of nsp14 N7-MTase is localized on the opposite side of nsp12 NiRAN.
Nsp14 ExoN contributes the majority of interactions for the association of nsp10/nsp14 into Cap(0)-RTC with a contacting surface of 2,396 Å 2 ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Table S2 ). The side-chain nitrogen atoms of nsp9 R111 form hydrogen bonds with the imidazole group of nsp14 H95 and the carbonyl of nsp14 T103 and a side-chain nitrogen of nsp14 K13 forms a hydrogen bond with nsp12 Q224. The side-chain nitrogen atoms of nsp14 R98 contact with nsp12 Q81 and nsp12 E84. The overall structure of nsp10/nsp14 complex in Cap(0)-RTC shows strong similarities with that reported in the crystal structures of nsp10/nsp14 complex ( Ma et al., 2015 25. Ma, Y. ∙ Wu, L. ∙ Shaw, N. ... Structural basis and functional analysis of the SARS coronavirus nsp14-nsp10 complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :9436-9441 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 A). The residues of nsp14 interacting with nsp10 includes nsp14 T5, nsp14 D10, nsp14 T21, nsp14 T25, nsp14 H26, nsp14 C39, nsp14 D41, nsp14 K47, nsp14 Y51, nsp14 F60, nsp14 T127, nsp14 N130, and nsp14 T131, which are consistent with the reported crystal structure ( Ma et al., 2015 25.

USA. 2015; 112 :9436-9441 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sequence comparison shows that these key interacting residues are highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and RaTG13 ( Figure S6 B), suggesting a common mechanism for N7-CCC formation in CoVs. The N terminus of nsp9 inserts into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, which is similar to that observed in Cap(−1)′-RTC ( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the bound GDP-Mg 2+ in the nsp12 NiRAN catalytic center is missing. It is noteworthy that a recent study suggests that nsp9 is a substrate for nsp12 NiRAN NMPylation, but in another study it is debated that nsp7 is the substrate ( Conti et al., 2020 10. Conti, B.J. ∙ Kirchdoerfer, R.N. ∙ Sussman, M.R. Mass spectrometric based detection of protein nucleotidylation in the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.2010.2007.330324 Google Scholar ; Slanina et al., 2021 43.

Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2022310118 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesize that the post-translation modification of nsp9 by nsp12 NiRAN might play a role in complex formation.
The inter-protomer interactions of dCap(0)-RTC are contributed by nsp7, nsp8-2, nsp12 NiRAN/thumb/palm/fingers, nsp13-2 ZBD, nsp14 ExoN, and N7-MTase at five separate regions ( Figure 3 A; Table S3 ).
In region 1, nsp14 V460, nsp14 Y465, nsp14 L479, and nsp14 V483 of nsp14 N7-MTase in protomer A forms a hydrophobic interface with the residues nsp13-2 I79, nsp13-2 F81, and nsp13-2 F90 of nsp13-2 ZBD′ in protomer B ( Figure 3 B). Three hydrogen bonds are observed between nsp14 D464, nsp14 S470, and nsp14 Y517 of nsp14 N7-MTase in protomer A and nsp8-2 Y12 (in nsp8-2′), nsp12 S904 (in nsp12 thumb′), and nsp13-2 N86 (in nsp13-2 ZBD′) in protomer B ( Figure 3 C). Notably, the loop region of nsp14 N7-MTase spanning residues nsp14 S454- nsp14 D464, which cannot be traced in the reported crystal structure, is well defined with unambiguous cryo-EM density ( Figure S6 A, right panel). We reason that the contact of this region with nsp13-2 ZBD′ in the other Cap(0)-RTC protomer helps to stabilize its conformation.
In region 2, the residues of nsp14 N7-MTase (including nsp14 L406, nsp14 K433, nsp14 Q441, and nsp14 I502) and ExoN (residue nsp14 D172) in protomer A constitute a set of inter-molecular interactions with the residues of nsp12 thumb′ (including nsp12 Q886, nsp12 R889, nsp12 E917, and nsp12 E919) and nsp12 fingers′ (including nsp12 K426 and nsp12 E431) in protomer B ( Figure 3 D). In region 3, although nsp12 NiRAN and palm are located in the central parts of dCap(0)-RTC and face each other, only a single bond formed by nsp12 I106 in protomer A and nsp12 N158 in protomer B is observed ( Figure 3 A). It is noteworthy that the inter-protomer interface are located on the opposite side of the SAM and GpppA binding sites of nsp14 N7-MTase, allowing full solvent exposure of the nsp14 N7-MTase catalytic site in dCap(0)-RTC.
In Cap(0)-RTCs, two nsp13s are located on a plane formed by nsp12 and two nsp8s, which are in the similar position as they are in E-RTC and Cap(−1)′-RTC ( Figures 1 B and 1C). In mCap(0)-RTC, the folding of the two nsp13s is virtually identical. In dCap(0)-RTC, nsp13-1, which does not bind template RNA and was shown to play a role in the stimulation of the helicase activity of another nsp13 ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), exhibit structural similarity in dCap(0)-RTC and E-RTC with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.74 Å for all Cα atoms ( Figure 4 A, left panel). In contrast, nsp13-2, which binds to the 5′ extension of the unpaired template RNA, exhibits a remarkable conformational change within its 1B domain ( Figure 4 A, right panel). Nsp13-2 1B in dCap(0)-RTC exhibits a ~90° rotation toward nsp13-2 ZBD alongside the C terminus of nsp13-2 S and is approximately 25 Å from nsp13-2 2A ( Figure 4 A, right panel). In contrast, the 1B domain in all other reported structures of CoV nsp13 (either crystal or cryo-EM structures) is adjacent to the 2A domain. This previously unobserved position of nsp13-2 1B not only causes variation of the inter-helicase interactions but also results in significant differences in helicase-RNA interaction ( Figures 4 B–4L).
In mCap(0)-RTC, the loop region spanning residues nsp13-2 T214- nsp13-2 V221 of nsp13-2 1B makes contacts with the long loop region connecting nsp13-1 1B and 1A ( Figures 4 B and 4F). Similar inter-helicase interactions can be also found in the structures of E-RTC ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Cap(−1)′-RTC ( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 D, 4E, 4H, and 4I). Following the movement of nsp13-2 1B in dCap(0)-RTC, the contacts between the 1B domains of the two nsp13 in RTC is completely abolished ( Figures 4 C and 4G). Moreover, the loop region spanning residues nsp13-2 G203- nsp13-2 A208 of nsp13-2 1B in dCap(0)-RTC contacts nsp13-1 ZBD and nsp8-1 ( Figure 4 J). In this region, the side chain of nsp13-2 D204 hydrogen bonds with N η1 of nsp8-2 R75 in the central long helix of nsp8-2, and the carbonyl oxygen of nsp13-2 G206 contacts with the side chain of nsp13-1 Q11 in the ZBD. Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 RTCs have shown that nsp8-1 participates in the assembly of C-RTC to arm the paired template-product RNA and in the recruitment of nsp13-1 into RTCs ( Wang et al., 2020 50. Wang, Q. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Wang, H. ... Structural Basis for RNA Replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase Cell. 2020; 182 :417-428 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structural feature presented in dCap(0)-RTC suggests that nsp8-1 also contacts with nsp13-2 with a conformational change of the 1B domain, presumably to play a role in the regulation of the function of nsp13-2.
The movement of nsp13-2 1B is associated with the variations in RNA interactions. Although we used the same template and primer RNAs in our investigations on RTCs in this and previous studies ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ), the unpaired 5′ extension of the template RNA is not observed in the mCap(0)-RTC like in Cap(−1)′-RTC. We therefore only compared the binding of nsp13-2 with the 5′ extension of template RNA in dCap(0)-RTC and in E-RTC ( Figures 4 K and 4L).
In E-RTC, tU+7 to tU+12 in the unpaired 5′ extension of template RNA is anchored in a RNA-binding channel clamped by nsp13-2 1A, 2A and 1B domains ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 H and 4L). The positively charged side chains of nsp13-2 N177 and nsp13-2 R178 of nsp13-2 1B bond with tA+10 and tA+11, and the imidazole group of nsp13-2 H230 packs with the base of tA+8 ( Figure 4 L, right panel). In dCap(0)-RTC, the RNA-binding channel is disappears following the downward movement of nsp13-2 1B. As a result, the cryo-EM density shows there is no binding of RNA to nsp13-2 1A and 2A domains. However, the unambiguous cryo-EM density supports a model of template RNA continuously extended from tC+4 to tA+9 ( Figures 4 G and 4K). The side chains of nsp13-2 N177 and nsp13-2 R178 of nsp13-2 1B contact with tU+7 and tA+8 of the unpaired 5′ extension of template RNA, but nsp13-2 H230 does not interact with template RNA ( Figure 4 K). The nucleotides of tU+3 to tG+6 in E-RTC cannot be traced in this cryo-EM density map ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ) but have good density in dCap(0)-RTC ( Figure 4 G). We reasoned that the contact of nsp13-2 N177 and nsp13-2 R178 with RNA in dCap(0)-RTC helps to stabilize the conformation of these four nucleotides. It is noteworthy that the densities of the first 17 nucleotides cannot be visualized in dCap(0)-RTC, though there is sufficient length of RNA to reach nsp13-2 1A/2A, suggesting 1B, but not 1A and 2A, plays the most important role in RNA binding of helicase.
The orientations of helicases show distinct features in different RTCs ( Figures 4 B-4E). In E-RTC, ZBDs of two nsp13 are placed on the long helical structure of nsp8-1 and nsp8-2 ( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 D). Although the folding of two helicases are identical in Cap(−1)′-RTC, the orientation of nsp13-2 changes, with nsp13-2 ZBD inserting deeply into the second minor groove of the paired template-primer RNA ( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 E), reasoning E-RTC is in a “Elongation” state and Cap(−1)′-RTC is in a “Suspending” state.
In mCap(0)-RTC, nsp13-2 has a similar orientation as in Cap(−1)′-RTC and inserts its ZBD into the paired template-primer RNA ( Figure 4 B), suggesting mCap(0)-RTC is also in a “Suspending” state. In contrast, despite nsp13-2 1B having a large conformational change in dCap(0)-RTC, nsp13-2 ZBD stays in a state as it appears in E-RTC. Both ZBD and 1B with conformational change of nsp13-2 makes no interaction with the paired template-primer RNA ( Figure 4 C), suggesting the movement of RNA is possible in dCap(0)-RTC as in E-RTC, rather in mCap(0)-RTC.

Section: Discussion

The coupling of capping machinery(s) in SARS-CoV-2 RTC is essential for virus mRNA maturation and gene transcription. In previous studies, the assembly of RTCs for RNA synthesis and its inhibition by nucleotide analog inhibitors (e.g., remdesivir) have been well characterized ( Chen et al., 2020 8. Chen, J. ∙ Malone, B. ∙ Llewellyn, E. ...

Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 52.

Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, how CCC couples in SARS-CoV-2 RTC remains unclear. Here, we have reconstituted SARS-CoV-2 Cap(0)-RTC and determined its structure, providing the first images for the coupling of N7-CCC in RTC and for dissecting the mechanism of the capping actions. In N7-CCC, the catalytic site of nsp12 NiRAN, which catalyzes the second capping action to yield GpppA, locates on the opposite side of the catalytic center of nsp14 N7-MTase, which facilitates the third capping action to generate the cap(0) ( 7Me GpppA) ( Figure 5 A). A possible path for transferring the 5′ end of pre-mRNA with GpppA is reasoned that initiating from nsp12 NiRAN, passing through a positively charged region surrounded by nsp14 K433/K440/K512, and reaching the catalytic site of nsp14 N7-MTase ( Figure 5 B). Notably, a zinc finger (ZF3) has been reported at nsp14 C484/C452/C477/H487 in the crystal structure ( Ma et al., 2015 25. Ma, Y. ∙ Wu, L. ∙ Shaw, N. ... Structural basis and functional analysis of the SARS coronavirus nsp14-nsp10 complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :9436-9441 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). This zinc finger is located on the potential path of transferring mRNA and may play a role in stabilizing mRNA for further modification. Moreover, A1 of GpppA is buried in a deep pocket in nsp14 N7-MTase, but G0 of GpppA is relatively exposed to solvent in the crystal structure ( Ma et al., 2015 25. Ma, Y. ∙ Wu, L. ∙ Shaw, N. ... Structural basis and functional analysis of the SARS coronavirus nsp14-nsp10 complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :9436-9441 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 B, left panel). This conformation is not likely to allow the connection of A1 to the downstream sequence of mRNA, indicating the binding of the 5′ end of pre-mRNA with GpppA to the catalytic center of nsp14 N7-MTase may vary from that observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, the potential path for transferring mRNA on N7-CCC is occupied in dCap(0)-RTC by another Cap(0)-RTC protomer, indicating the capping actions may not occur in dCap(0)-RTC.
RNA viruses commonly exhibit high mutation rates, being attributed to the relatively low replication fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the lack of proofreading mechanism ( Ogando et al., 2020 33. Ogando, N.S. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J.C. ∙ van der Meer, Y. ... The Enzymatic Activity of the nsp14 Exoribonuclease Is Critical for Replication of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e01246 20 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the expansion of RNA genome sizes is restricted to below 15 kb for most RNA virus families to balance replication fidelity, genome size, and complexity ( Saberi et al., 2018 39. Saberi, A. ∙ Gulyaeva, A.A. ∙ Brubacher, J.L. ... A planarian nidovirus expands the limits of RNA genome size PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14 :e1007314 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). CoVs have the largest RNA genomes among RNA viruses and employ a proofreading mechanism to ensure replication fidelity. In proofreading, mis-incorporated nucleotides are excised through the 3′-5′ ExoN activity of nsp14 ( Ferron et al., 2018 18. Ferron, F. ∙ Subissi, L. ∙ Silveira De Morais, A.T. ...

USA. 2018; 115 :E162-E171 Crossref Scopus (268) PubMed Google Scholar ; Munster et al., 2020 29. Munster, V.J. ∙ Feldmann, F. ∙ Williamson, B.N. ...

Microbiol. 2019; 10 :1813 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the concerted motion between nsp14 ExoN and polymerase remains unclear. In bacteria and eukaryotes, backtracking, which refers to the reversible sliding of RNA polymerase along DNA/RNA, has been implicated in many critical processes, including providing a basic mechanism for transcriptional proofreading ( Nudler, 2012 30. Nudler, E. RNA polymerase backtracking in gene regulation and genome instability Cell. 2012; 149 :1438-1445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nudler et al., 1997 31.

Any mis-match nucleotides in the RNA:DNA hybrid would induce immediate backtracking, thus resulting in the subsequent removal of the mis-incorporated nucleotides at 3′ end of RNA by exonuclease ( Nudler, 2012 30. Nudler, E. RNA polymerase backtracking in gene regulation and genome instability Cell. 2012; 149 :1438-1445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2009 48. Wang, D. ∙ Bushnell, D.A. ∙ Huang, X. ... Structural basis of transcription: backtracked RNA polymerase II at 3.4 angstrom resolution Science. 2009; 324 :1203-1206 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). In SARS-CoV-2 mCap(0)-RTC, the catalytic center of nsp14 ExoN is distal from the polymerase reaction center of nsp12 and the exit of product RNA with an approximate distance of 80 and 120 Å ( Figure 6 A), indicating proofreading occurring in the monomeric Cap(0)-RTC is less likely. Interestingly, in dCap(0)-RTC, the catalytic center of nsp14 ExoN of one Cap(0)-RTC protomer faces to the polymerase reaction center of nsp12 at the 3′ end of primer chain at a distance of ~35 Å ( Figure 6 A). Considering the ~6 Å average length between two nucleotides in a single-stranded RNA, a backtracking of RNA with 6 nucleotides from the nsp12 polymerase reaction center in one Cap(0)-RTC protomer is plausible to reach the catalytic center of nsp14 ExoN in another Cap(0)-RTC protomer ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Based on these structural features, we propose a speculative model for an in trans backtracking mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 proofreading concerted by nsp12 polymerase, nsp13-2 helicase, and nsp14 ExoN ( Figure 6 D). In the elongation step, nsp13-2 functions as a helicase to unwind the high-ordered structure in the genome with the help of nsp13-1. At this stage, nsp13-2 1B domain is in position to constitute a RNA-binding groove together with 1A/2A domains for RNA unwinding and the residue nsp13-2 R178 of nsp13-2 1B locates in the position of tA+10 at the 5′ end of the unpaired template RNA as presented in E-RTC. Once RTC senses the mis-incorporated nucleotide, nsp13-2 1B would undergo a large conformational changes in dCap(0)-RTC, allowing nsp13-2 R178 to lose contact with the nucleotide at the tA+10 position in E-RTC and move to the position of tU+7 as shown in dCap(0)-RTC to interact with the nucleotide located there. Subsequently, nsp13-2 1B moves back to its original position, thus dragging the template RNA toward the upstream direction. Meanwhile, the 3′ end of primer RNA with the mis-incorporated nucleotide is backtracked by 6 nucleotides toward the upstream of the 3′ end direction. It should be noted since the backtracking does not really occur in dCap(0)-RTC due to RNA and experimental conditions used to reconstitute RTCs, the binding of nsp13-2 R178 of nsp13-2 1B with tA+10 in E-RTC but with tU+7 in dCap(0)-RTC does not mean that backtracking of 4 nucleotides occurs in reality. Alternatively, the ~35 Å distance of nsp13-2 R178 of nsp13-2 1B moving from its position in Cap(0)-RTC to its position in E-RTC suggests a backtracking of 6 nucleotides would be possible. As a consequence, the 3′ end of the backtracked primer RNA with the mis-incorporated nucleotide would recruit nsp14 ExoN in another Cap(0)-RTC protomer, for further processing of the mis-incorporated nucleotide at the catalytic center of nsp14 ExoN. After the correction of the mis-incorporated nucleotide, nsp13-2 1B would return to its original position, allowing normal helicase activity to move template RNA forward and elongate primer RNA. At this stage, dCap(0)-RTC is likely to be released into the monomeric form.
A recent study showed SARS-CoV-2 possessing nsp14 with the L177F, P203L, S369F, or M501I mutations has a higher genomic mutation rate than SARS-CoV-2 with wild-type nsp14 ( Takada et al., 2020 47. Takada, K. ∙ Ueda, M.T. ∙ Watanabe, T. ... Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 can be accelerated by a mutation in the nsp14 gene bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.2012.2023.424231 Google Scholar ). Among these, the M501I mutation occurs in nsp14 N7-MTase, which is not associated with the enzymatic activity of nsp14 ExoN, but it is located on the dimer interface and thus plays a key role in stabilizing the conformation of an helix in nsp14 N7-MTase and in the formation of dCap(0)-RTC. The impact of M501 on SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate can be explained by our proposed model. Moreover, another recent study reported a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure with nucleotide analogs and finds the mis-incorporated nucleotide analogs can pause the RdRp function, allowing nsp13 to induce backtracking, which forces the 3′ end of the primer RNA out the NTP-entry channel ( Malone et al., 2021 26. Malone, B. ∙ Chen, J. ∙ Wang, Q. ... Structural basis for backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2102516118 Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar ). The direction of the primer RNA 3′ end out the NTP-entry channel is consistent to that observed in the dCap(0)-RTC structure, this being toward the catalytic center of nsp14 ExoN.
The backtracking proofreading is widely found among DNA polymerases ( Fernandez-Leiro et al., 2017 17. Fernandez-Leiro, R. ∙ Conrad, J. ∙ Yang, J.C. ... Self-correcting mismatches during high-fidelity DNA replication Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2017; 24 :140-143 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Johnson and Beese, 2004 24. Johnson, S.J. ∙ Beese, L.S. Structures of mismatch replication errors observed in a DNA polymerase Cell. 2004; 116 :803-816 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RNA polymerases ( Cheung and Cramer, 2011 9. Cheung, A.C. ∙ Cramer, P. Structural basis of RNA polymerase II backtracking, arrest and reactivation Nature. 2011; 471 :249-253 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2009 48.

Structural basis of transcription: backtracked RNA polymerase II at 3.4 angstrom resolution Science. 2009; 324 :1203-1206 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Similarities could be found with the backtracking proofreading in SARS-CoV-2. For example, the distance from the catalytic center of nsp14 ExoN in one protomer to the catalytic center of polymerase of nsp12 in another protomer is 35 Å in SARS-CoV-2 dCap(0)-RTC, and the typical distance between the active centers of other polymerases and ExoN is 30~40 Å in the correction of DNA mismatch ( Fernandez-Leiro et al., 2017 17. Fernandez-Leiro, R. ∙ Conrad, J. ∙ Yang, J.C. ... Self-correcting mismatches during high-fidelity DNA replication Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2017; 24 :140-143 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unique features could be also identified in SARS-CoV-2 backtracking proofreading, including the conformational change of helicase 1B domain, as well as the specific excision of 3′ mismatched nucleotide by nsp14 ExoN but not removal of a mismatched fragment as observed in Pol II ( Nudler, 2012 30. Nudler, E. RNA polymerase backtracking in gene regulation and genome instability Cell. 2012; 149 :1438-1445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Notably, in dCap(0)-RTC, the potential transfer path for the 5′ end of pre-mRNA is through the inter-protomer interface, indicating that backtracking proofreading would not concurrently occur with capping actions. This is supported by the orientation of nsp13-2 ZBD in a “suspending” state, in which nsp13-2 ZBD inserts into the paired template:primer RNA, in both mCap(0)-RTC and in Cap(−1)′-RTC as an intermediate state during capping actions ( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, nsp13-2 ZBD leaves the paired template-primer RNA in free state both in dCap(0)-RTC and in E-RTC, thus allowing the active movement of RNA in either a “backtracking” state or a “elongation” state ( Figures 4 B–4E). This gives an explanation for the simultaneous existences of monomeric and dimeric Cap(0)-RTC in solution, representing nsp14 as a bifunctional enzyme participating in proofreading and in capping actions.
Furthermore, the proofreading is suggested to be a factor impacting on the inhibitory efficacy of nucleotide analog inhibitors( Robson et al., 2020 36. Robson, F. ∙ Khan, K.S. ∙ Le, T.K. ... Coronavirus RNA Proofreading: Molecular Basis and Therapeutic Targeting Mol. Cell. 2020; 80 :1136-1138 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, EIDD-1931, a cytidine analog with broad spectrum antiviral activity against coronaviruses, is the first mutagenic nucleotide analog inhibitor demonstrating the ability to evade nsp14 ExoN proofreading ( Robson et al., 2020 36. Robson, F. ∙ Khan, K.S. ∙ Le, T.K. ... Coronavirus RNA Proofreading: Molecular Basis and Therapeutic Targeting Mol. Cell. 2020; 80 :1136-1138 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is the reason that EIDD-1931 cannot be recognized and excised by nsp14 ExoN, giving an explanation to its enhanced efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 containing resistance mutations to remdesivir ( Sheahan et al., 2020 42. Sheahan, T.P. ∙ Sims, A.C. ∙ Zhou, S. ... An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and multiple coronaviruses in mice Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12 :eabb5883 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of dCap(0)-RTC containing a primer chain with nucleotide analog inhibitor at the 3′ end is needed to provide a structural basis for the optimization of inhibitor to achieve higher efficacy against drug resistant variants.
In conclusion, the structure of SARS-CoV2 Cap(0)-RTC reported here presents a molecular basis for co-transcriptional modification of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA and reveals an in trans backtracking mechanism for proofreading. These results provide new insights on the understanding of the replication and transcription cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and a structural basis for the optimization of antiviral inhibitors such as EIDD-1931.
Although the in trans backtracking model for proofreading is proposed, a structure of dCap(0)-RTC with a backtracked RNA extended from the 3′ end of primer chain at the active center of polymerase to the active center of nsp14 ExoN is needed to warrant in further study.

The cryo-EM density maps and the structures were deposited into the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) and Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession numbers 31138 and 7EGQ for dCap(0)-RTC, and 31146 and 7EIZ for mCap(0)-RTC.
Proteins were obtained through recombinant expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3).
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 (GenBank: MN908947) gene was cloned into a modified pET-22b vector, with the C terminus possessing a 10 × His-tag. Protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as described( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cells were harvested and the pellets were resuspended in a buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4°C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 50 min. The fusion protein was first purified by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography and then further purified by passage through a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 4 mM DTT) and buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1M NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 4 mM DTT). Next the sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) with DEPC-treated buffer C (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM GDP and 2 mM BeF 3 - ). Purified nsp12 was concentrated to 4.8 mg/mL and stored at 4°C.
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 was cloned into pGEX-6p vector with a N-terminal GST -tag, and SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 inserted into pRSF-duet with no tag, and co-transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellets resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 5% glycerol). An ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4°C was used for lysis,and the product was centrifuged for 14000 rpm at 4°C. Recombinant protein was purified by GST-affinity chromatography and the GST-tag was removed by PreScission protease. The complex was further purified by passage through a Hitrap SP ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) with buffer A (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 4 mM DTT) and buffer B (25 mM HEPES, pH7.0, 1 M NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 4 mM DTT). Then it was load onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) with a buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT). Purified nsp10/nsp14 complex was concentrated to 8 mg/mL and stored at 4°C. The nsp9-10 sample was also cloned into pGEX-6p vector, and the purification of nsp9-10/nsp14 complex was identical to the procedure for nsp10/nsp14.The preparation of nsp9 was performed as described previously( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nsp9 was cloned into a modified pET-28b-SUMO with the N terminus of a fusion of 6 × His-tag. The protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). After harvesting by centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4°C. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min to remove cell debris. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography and by application to a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in lysis buffer. Purified nsp9 was concentrated to 5 mg/mL and stored at 4°C.
Full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 were co-expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as a no-tagged protein and a 6 × His-SUMO fusion protein, respectively. After purification by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography, the nsp7-nsp8 complex was eluted through on-column tag cleavage by ULP protease. The complex was further purified by using a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) and a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in buffer C containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM GDP and 2 mM BeF 3 - .
Nsp13 was purified as described previously( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nsp13 gene was inserted into the modified pET-28a vector with a 6 × His tag attached at its N terminus, and protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol). The cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 40 min and then lysed by high-pressure homogenization and sonication. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA (Novagen, USA) affinity chromatography and Hitrap SP ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA), and finally nsp13 protein was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in buffer C. Purified nsp13 was concentrated to 8 mg/mL and stored at 4°C.
Nsp12 was incubated with nsp7 and nsp8 at 4°C for three hours in a molar ratio of 1: 2: 2 in buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl 2 ). Next, the mixture was purified by mono Q 5/50 ion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, USA), producing the nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex (C-RTC). C-RTC and nsp13 and RNA were mixed to form E-RTC at a 1:2:1 molar ratio as described previously( Yan et al., 2020 53. Yan, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ge, J. ... Architecture of a SARS-CoV-2 mini replication and transcription complex Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :5874 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). E-RTC was incubated with the nsp9-nsp10/nsp14 complex at a 1:1.2 molar ratio with 2 mM GDP•BeF 3 - to assemble the Cap(0)-RTC.
The binding reaction buffer contained 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM GDP and 2 mM BeF 3 - . 18 μg RdRp (nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) complex protein was combined with 1.5 μg template-primer RNA, and RdRp/RNA and nsp13, or nsp9, or nsp10/14 mixed in a 1:2, or 1:1.2, or 1:1.2 molar ratio. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30°C. Reactions were run on a six lane polyacrylamide native gel (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) running in 1 × TBE buffer at 150 V for 1h in 4°C. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide.
In total, 3 μL of protein sample at 3 mg/mL (added with 0.025% DDM) was applied onto a H2/O2 glow-discharged, 200-mesh Quantifoil R0.6/1.0 grid (Quantifoil, Micro Tools GmbH, Germany). The grid was then blotted for 3.0 s with a blot force of 0 at 8°C and 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cryo-EM data were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan, USA). Images were recorded at 22500 × magnification and calibrated at a super-resolution pixel size of 0.82 Å/pixel. The exposure time was set to 2 s with a total accumulated dose of 60 electrons per Å 2 . All images were automatically recorded using SerialEM. A total of 12,704 images were collected with a defocus range from −2.0 μm to −1.0 μm. Statistics for data collection and refinement are in Table S1 . The methods for processing are described in Figures S2 and S4 .
All dose-fractioned images were motion-corrected and dose-weighted by MotionCorr2( Zheng et al., 2017 54. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) software and their contrast transfer functions were estimated by ctffind4( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 37. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2863) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 2,039,214 particles were auto-picked using the model from SARS-CoV-2 Cap(−1)’-RTC (PDB: 7CYQ )( Yan et al., 2021 52. Yan, L. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Zheng, L. ... Cryo-EM Structure of an Extended SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription Complex Reveals an Intermediate State in Cap Synthesis Cell. 2021; 184 :184-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) and extracted with a box size of 448 pixels in cryoSPARC( Punjani et al., 2017 35. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following 2D, 3D classifications and refinements were all performed in cryoSPARC. 887,588 particles were selected after two rounds of 2D classification based on complex integrity. This particle set was used to do Ab-Initio reconstruction in five classes, which were then used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous refinement, with 135,801 particles converged into dCap(0)-RTC complex class and 80,256 particles converged into mCap(0)-RTC complex class. Next, these particles were imported into RELION 3.03( Scheres, 2012 40. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform local classification to obtain one class particle with final resolution 3.35 Å and 3.78 Å, respectively. The methods are described in Figures S2 and S4 .
To build the structure of SARS-CoV-2 Cap(0)-RTC complex, we started with the model of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 and nsp7-8 complex (PDB: 7BTF ), SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 (PDB: 6ZSL ), nsp9 (PDB: 6W9Q ) and nsp10/nsp14 (PDB: 6C8S ). These were individually placed and rigid-body fitted into the cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera( Pettersen et al., 2004 34. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model was manually built in Coot( Emsley et al., 2010 16. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the guidance of the cryo-EM map, and with real space refinement using Phenix( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Klaholz, B.P. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... New tools for the analysis and validation of cryo-EM maps and atomic models Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :814-840 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data validation statistics are shown in Table S1 .
In Figures S2 and S4 , the resolution estimations of cryo-EM density maps are based on the 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion( Chen et al., 2013 7.
